English
hello everyone
and welcome back to english with lucy
today ive got a very special guest
it is anbu from conquer british english
hello everyone its a pleasure to be
so this is the first part of a twopart
the second part of the lesson is on
anbus channel
the link is in the description box today
were going to be looking at the
between british english and indian
i grew up in bedfordshire in england but
i live in cambridgeshire
and i speak with a modern rp accent
sometimes with a bit of estuary as well
and yeah i actually speak with a similar
accent to lucys
um but during the course of this video
im sure youll be able to hear the
differences there because i actually
grew up in london
and i also have hints of multicultural
london english
and shortened down to emily in my in my
in my accent too
and um just to let you know im of tamil
and we just wanted to also mention you
know india is such a
diverse country and the population is
huge theres over one billion people
living in india
and just to put that in perspective if
you kind of compare india to europe
um just the number of nations in europe
and the languages that they speak
you will notice some differences in in
the indian
english that you use um so wed love to
um whether you use any words slightly
differently and wed love to hear your
thoughts on that in the comments section
yes definitely this is all about
learning and sharing so please do
use that comment section to tell us how
you speak and the words that you use
what id love to do is um give you a
taste of what one form of the indian
accent sounds like in when were
discussing these words so yes
please do so if you give some of the
yeah id love to do that thatd be
really cool cool another important thing
to note
is that ambu has created a pdf for this
with all of the vocabulary differences
and some extra quizzes and interesting
so you can click on the link in the
description box to download that for
videos okay so the first one is
this one its a vegetable yeah
i would call this okra we would call it
ladyfingers thats so funny because
is actually the name of a spongy biscuit
oh really
yes its kind of the bottom layer of a
sometimes do you like do you like the
taste of lady fingers in touring the
i mean the vegetable yeah yeah i love it
honestly i think its quite a boring
biscuit yeah
um i think thats really funny i mean
you can see why its called that cant
but ive um grown up eating okra lady
fingers and its got a very slimy
texture to it
but yeah its using a lot of our dishes
yeah its not something
that we cook with a lot here but we
absolutely love curries
um i think weve actually named the
chicken tikka masala as our national
it was voted as the british national
dish really thats how much we love it
yeah so the next word weve got for you
is this one
brinjal you call it brinjal brinjal
thats so funny i wonder where that
comes from
we call this aubergine but this is quite
a controversial world
yes that too yes
no this is quite a controversial word
because in american english they call it
eggplant and thats it because eggplant
eggplant eggplant
because the flower bud looks like an egg
have you ever oh i didnt ive never
seen it no no
is that one okay we call it aubergine
and brinjal im going to start calling
it brinjal i just like calling it
eggplant i love the accent all right the
next one
is this its the ingredient that makes
up a lot of curries and
i eat it for breakfast a lot um we call
yoghurt in indian english its often
called curd
which is really interesting because kurd
actually has a different meaning i guess
in british english when we imagine curd
yeah do we imagine different consistency
yeah isnt curd like the creamy part of
exactly yeah in indian english you would
often hear phrases like
could you add some curd to my dish or
im just going to pop out and buy some
and not pop out because i guess pop out
saying im going to go to the shops and
buy some curd interesting
but like a dessert yogurt so
strawberryflavored yogurt you wouldnt
say a pot of curd
no i dont think he would know okay yeah
interesting the next one weve got is a
really interesting one because ive
grown up hearing it all the time and
its often been a source of
argument in the household this one is
luck or lack okay yeah
so we dont have a picture for this one
because i need to guess what it is
lark luck like a lark but its not its
not spelled with a
r its spelled l a k h okay
something to do with luck nope something
to do with the bird
it kind of sounds like it right so one
lakh is
a unit in the indian numbering system it
actually represents a hundred thousand
in conversation you might hear someone
say i bought that house
for 10 lakhs so that would be a million
pounds yeah exactly because 10 times 100
000 is 1 million right i just think also
its amazing the way you can switch
between those two acts
thank you so does that is that maybe
rupees are a smaller value
so youre more likely to have something
perhaps because we would
a hundred thousand pounds a lot
yeah that could be that could be a
viable um
reason i think there might be a
difference in the numbering systems as
across across the different nations so
that will
influence how we think about numbers
and then the term that we attribute to a
particular sum of
money or a particular number amazing
because i just would have no idea
if someone yeah told me ten luck in my
household when were talking about
um my parents always use blacks
and my siblings and i we use a hundred
thousand or a million
and we often have miscommunication when
were when were talking about numbers
it leads to a lot of confusion in the
even within your own household yeah all
right this next one
i wonder if you can tell what it is from
the picture
in british english we would refer to
this as marriage
now you would often hear this being
referred to as an alliance
um sounds really formal doesnt it
forming in an artist yes
um but yeah thats often a term that
would you also use marriage as well yeah
for sure
um but in terms of an example sentence
uh someone could say
that these two people are seeking an
alliance or theyre looking for an
thats so funny because i would think
that would be a business person
looking to join forces with someone else
when actually it describes an emotional
connection and an official one as well
let us know if
marriage is often referred to in a
different way
from the part of india that youre from
so uh the next one
is you know when its a rainy day and
you just want to catch that bus youre
going to be waiting at
a bus how would you say it a bus stop
bus stop
in indian english you often hear it as
stand or a bus halt it makes sense
yeah holt is kind of a more formal word
like a more oldfashioned word for stop
british english and then a stand well
you stand there dont you
so yeah and i guess theyre maybe
referring to the actual stand of the
the pole of the bus signs on the top
right the signage if i heard bus stand
id know exactly what is meant by it
but we definitely tend to say bus stop
yeah okay
this next one is the word we use to
a man in a position of authority for
example a teacher
or your boss i mean in british english
we would just say first name terms for
or mr and then their surname for a
i remember mr purdum was my favorite
teacher at school so i would
just call him mr purdum or mr yeah
thats absolutely right
in london ive you know grown up calling
my teachers mr
mr smith for example in india you would
refer to your male teacher as
sir and thats quite common place and
your boss as sir as well
um so with the accent it sounds
something like this
sar so you would hear an indian person
saying saar can you please help me with
the homework please
sorry i was just so in love with what
you were saying i really
really like the accent it is just so
gentle isnt it like
its almost like caressing the r sound
we do use the word sir
we do dont we but i would say for a
boss its too formal thats always
showing too much inequality i would
um but in some schools it depends on the
schools regulations
maybe some private schools places like
that would insist on a more formal code
yeah thats true but i never had to call
my teachers sir at school
um what about female teachers females um
so we so in british english we would say
madden wouldnt in a really formal
setting im just wondering whether sir
madam is used in india because in an
email you would say dear sir madam
in indian english we would refer to a
male teacher as
sir how do you guys refer to your female
teachers at school or your female boss
yeah that would be really interesting to
know because we say miss or mrs
depending if theyre depending on if
theyre married or not
yeah id like to know that the next one
is all about how you refer to members of
our family
so lucy if i was to say that i met up
with my brother
yesterday what how would you understand
that that you met up with your male
my male sibling who is my immediate my
immediate sibling right yes has the same
in indian english brother could also
my male cousin interesting so you do you
use the word cousin still
no so this is why when we speak to
a person whos speaking with british
english we would have to clarify that
and say cousin brother
even though it means cousin you would
often hear
in indian english someone referring to
their cousin as their cousin brother
interesting well we would just say
yeah or cousin sister if it was a female
okay yeah yeah its just the same for us
okay the next one is this
in british english we say boot or car
yeah in indian english we say dickie
so could you put the luggage in the diki
or could you
could you lend me a hand and put the
luggage in there dicky please
awesome and weve also seen a couple of
other spellings for it like
digi as well i guess it just depends on
the pronunciation i guess so as we
mentioned earlier lots of different
indian accents so i guess thats what
influences the spelling there
yeah and um again this is another word
that is also different in american
they call it a trunk they do dont they
ive always imagined an elephant
trunk when i write drunk so they dont
want to put any luggage up there yeah
oh god thats not the first trick ever
so the next one that i wanted to
introduce you to is how we use the word
in our daytoday life okay if i said
current what would you understand that
current is in in the moment that is a
good homophone isnt it um
yes the current for it it is
in the current moment in the current
moment lucy and i are filming
but this version of current is used in
daytoday life
for something else do you want to take
and take a guess
current as in like an ocean current or
electricity current
yes so we use the word current to
electricity i could advise you be
careful of the current lucy
when you are plugging in the plug into
the the socket be careful of the
electricity yes perfect
awesome i never knew that the next one
is a word used to describe
an illness yeah in british english we
diabetes and in indian english you could
hear this being referred to as
sugar and this is commonly used in the
state of tamil nadu
interesting and is this because diabetes
or some forms of diabetes are brought on
excess consumption absolutely absolutely
very interesting and how do you
pronounce it again
so i would pronounce this as sugar so um
do not eat too many sweets because you
could develop sugar
interesting the next one weve got on
the screen in
indian english it could be referred to
as the washroom
but it could also be referred to as the
toilet too
but what about british english well we
also say toilet um i know thats
something that in american english they
find a bit disgusting because its too
specific to the actual toilet
but we say the toilet or the loo thats
i always say the lou i think i heard you
call it
yeah yes i dont think washroom is that
common but thats not to say its never
used in british english
thats right yeah the next one is this
in british english we call it crisps
i know thats quite a hard sound thats
sound crisps
whats what do you call it in indian
english chips its commonly referred to
as chips chips
and what about fried potatoes that are
warm ah also chips
yeah i guess everythings yeah so the
next one weve got here
is referred to as capsicum
now how would you refer to it we would
call this peppers or
red pepper green pepper yellow pepper
but then surely that gets confusing the
kind of the pepper that you put on
your fish and chips yes but then the
pepper we put on
like as a seasoning is an uncountable
so id say can i have some pepper okay
that would be the
the spice or its not necessarily a
spice the seasoning
if i ask for a pepper im asking for a
capsicum that is a fantastic tip
so thats the end of the first part of
this video we have got the next part

soon for another lesson
Hello my name is Anpu and welcome to my YouTube channel and today
I wanted to you know introduce the Indian accent to you and I am very well aware that there is a
big variety of
Indian accents and not just Indian there is a Sri Lankan Pakistani and you know all over a South asia
there is different accent but I want to to introduce to you the South Indian accent You know
I am very interested in accents
And I you know if you ever interested in learning the Indian accent and perhaps you have a you know at acting role
Where you have to learn Indian accent this video will cover the basics of the Indian accent
So without further ado lets get straight into this video
Lets just address the elephant in the room
You were clearly judging me on my Indian accent werent you?
You know Im also passionate about like you know identity and racism but that is not the topic of todays discussion
Todays discussion is about the Indian accent and if you follow as few simple steps and a few simple rules
Youll be able to master the Indian accent You know really easily
Lets start off with the t sound so the t sounds something like this
tur not t tur  so your tongue is actually further back in your mouth
so for example if you want to say the word but in the Indian accent its but
Butokay so not but but so lets try
Its not dot its not
Okay so Im really exaggerating the t here
so try and practice that sound yeah and
Then tone it down a little bit so dot yeah it
It it
It so in the sentence dont try it becomes dont try it
Try it
so once youve practiced that the next sound practice is the L sound so
Lets take the word table for example
When we say the word table we dont actually pronounce the L in table
Youve got the t sound which we talked about earlier and this L sound so practice to start not teh
t and
Then it becomes
not table table
So can you put the you know groceries on the table?
please the next sound is the w sound so British people will pronounce w as work and
so the word water
turns into vodka
Okay so the w turns into a V and
Then the t in water is the sound that we practiced earlier
Then the R is what the last sound is what were going to practice So art isnt rough Its rough
so var Dad
Var det another one could be pizza beep done
Peter I
spoke to be Dead on the Phone I
Spoke to Peter on the phone
Alright so Im sure you can hear that difference there
and Ive tried to break down the particular sounds that sound different so go away and practice that and
You know I might do a part two
So hit like on this video if you found that video useful and you know this this video is not intended to make fun out
of any accent you know
Its purely educational
You know this video is all about if you are wondering one Indian accent sounds like and how exactly to do one I hope this
video helped Subscribe to my channel to stay in touch with
my latest videos I make videos on any life London life and
Traveling as well I hope you have a fantastic Christmas and Ill see you in the next video See you later
I even see you in the next video and
Take care of yourself Bye
allow it
Allow it man its please dont laugh into in it leave him alone you white white Why are you messing them around for love it?
Stop it Thats a bait
hi everyone my name is alina rice and
today im going to raise a question to
you this is something that i have felt
and observed a lot around myself and
want to know that if this is something
that bothers you too okay so this
definitely bothers me
um okay let me just quickly come to the
and this is kind of ironic coming from
me because okay youll know why im
saying this is ironic the point is that
indians unnecessarily speak english all
the time
youre going on the road somebody would
stop you request you to stop and ask for
direction they will ask in english then
youre supposed to reply in english okay
asking a question in english would imply
that you would
respond in english now this is slightly
difficult for people who do not know
english people who dont understand
english or who are not very fluent in it
or do not have that kind of confidence
to reply in english now it gets awkward
for those people ive seen that in my
own mothers case it is slightly
embarrassing i dont know um
not okay it may not be embarrassing for
me but it definitely is embarrassing for
her and i can see it on her face
because somehow we attach the status to
the language and
i feel that its i okay this is just my
opinion i may not be right in your eyes
here but okay respectfully let me know
if i am not right according to you but i
feel that
its slightly rude its slightly rude if
youre just assuming that the other
person would know english because you
know the kind of hype we attach in our
country to this language and assuming
the other person would know english
would be like
if they dont know it then youre
embarrassing them most of the times in
our country looking at the person you
can actually see and
more or less assume that the other
person would know hindi or would not
know hindi most of the times you can see
it from the way they are i think its
easy to predict right so if it is easy
to predict that somebody would
understand hindi or not why dont you
put forward your question in hindi it
will get easier for the other person
also to handle customer care people they
always start their conversations in
english you see people ordering stuff on
the counters like mcdonalds and
everywhere its always in english
i remember the first time i went up to a
mcdonalds counter i was a little girl i
was not very confident in english to be
honest and i remember the hesitation
that i felt walking up to that counter i
remember actually
so strange i remember speaking those
words in my mind to myself okay these
are 20 words that i have to say to this
girl i was actually repeating those
words in my head okay these are the
things i have to order and then she will
ask me this and im this and this is the
reply that im gonna give her
thats how i was actually preparing my
conversation for just ordering a burger
i mean what is wrong
why cant we just simply speak in hindi
with each other why do we have to always
unnecessarily speak in english to each
other all the time i know my channel has
more than 450 i dont know 4 30 40
english videos just because this is the
genre that ive picked for myself but
otherwise i
love speaking hindi i am so confident in
hindi hindi comes to me naturally
i feel i can
express more in hindi i feel that i love
this language and
the way i can
um express my happiness my sorrow my joy
and my my excitement and everything in
hindi i can never never justify the
feeling in any other language but still
somehow we always choose to speak in
please dont bash me for this dont tell
dont tell me things that may disappoint
me later just respectfully tell me if
you agree with me or you dont i feel
that we should speak more hindi in india
thats all that i have to say because
ive actually been to some other
countries of the world like ive been to
thailand and all and im telling you the
value theyre attached to their language
is awesome
like theyre not even they theyll just
tell you on the face okay no english no
english no english and then you have to
know explaining what you have to do with
them where you have to go wherever you
where youve got to get down what you
want from that person is your problem
they will just tell you on their face no
english and then youre on your own
i hope you get the point this is not to
insult or embarrass anyone this is not
to attract any unnecessary attention to
myself i dont want to do that this is
just me speaking my mind and my heart
this is just me
talking about the kind of appreciation
and love that i have for my language and
this is just me sharing a thought with
my friends and i just want to know if
you feel if you agree with me on this or
you dont its all right if you dont
but but i think a major section of you
would agree with me on this so thank you
very much ill see you again soon this
is it for today
you can hear me on spotify i have my
podcast there and all these audio files
of these videos are available there so
next time youre driving and you dont
have anything to listen to you can
probably listen to me okay then thank
you very much bye

its not like you know heres the word

how many is visual on Tulsa we know that
we got our English from the British
people but we Indians are very smart so
we made a few changes in the language so
that we could call it our own so today
we are getting our friends from BuzzFeed
UK to guess some of the Indian slang
what do you know about Indian slang do
you know anything at all I dont know
any Indians like Indian origin but I
would say I dont think I know much
about slang yeah I dont really know
anything about Indian style
so this should be interesting so lets
start here is the first leg cheater
she took home cheater cheater  it
sounds dirty like a guy thats a cheetah
cuz youre a dick like you know Sochi

very very very interesting words next

like youre vibing with the friends
youre hanging out with your friend
youre sitting down on the couch yeah
youre watching an episode of your
favorite TV show and you just you know
you come in no oh my god the way youre
laughing makes me think it definitely
isnt that how embarrassing it sounds so
sexual but Im gonna say its the act of
making friends I feel like this is like
when someone is sick and they like
vomiting and your chumming everywhere
the answer is when somebody is
menstruating oh why is mnster
in such a weird way to say that
oh Im just chilling today if somebodys
chumming you also say oh shes got the
channel yeah like that yes lovely lovely
next lange is non veg joke its a dirty
joke I just think its always like sex

to do with a carrot like a joke thats
not PC maybe it is a joke about
someones genitals and non of a joke is
basically a sexual joke yes ah
everything to do with the caring no so
whats the nonveg it involves all sorts
of meats so its called a nonveg  oh I
love that next flag is funda is it like

rainstorm gonna dance out in the rain or
in the monsoon in your life lets have a
fun I would like to have that word to
come the meaning of this it sounds like
a thing you would cool someone like
youre a  yeah
is it like a poop
its a fun day out funny damn ok the
meaning of Fonda is fundamentals or
basics how would you use it dissenters
the funda of making a great omelet is
finding the right pan next mocking mug
someone its like when you like steal
something from them all your mugging me
off is like youre taking me for dinner
something to do with tea like a mug of
are you sure bugging is stealing I dont
know maybe you liked it youre dipping
something in a cup of tea and youre
like mocking it because we both love tea
in the UK and India mugging means to
memorize for a test
Wow Wow sort of like mug get in you
drink the knowledge in without really
processing it thats how I got through
school by mugging I didnt understand
I just remembered it somehow oh yeah
thats what I did all the time like you
just like memorize the phrase and youre
like Ive got this but I have no idea
what it means the next leg is bunking so
we have it to in in the UK I wonder if
its the same in India probably not
maybe maybe not
bunking off like missing something
listening to music in your car
late night thats such a random guess
but if its right then
hey wow look at me bunking is when you
skip like a day of school or a day well
actually you are right to skip class or
to skip work ah I see ok I thought that
was an old thing they like are you
bunking off like yeah Im bunking up as
well next Lang is parcel it to be done
with it Im done parcel it imagine
someone is being really really emotional
like theyre crying loads that theyre
just being a lot put that sort away send
it away parcel it the meaning of parcel
it is to order a takeaway so if youre a
restaurant would you say all can you
parcel it parcel this for me yes and
then they just pack the food for you
yeah maybe Ill try it and yeah and
theyll be like wow you say youre
really hot on your Indian slang okay
next head back those things that
Americans call swirlies where when
youre in school and someone flushes you
down the toilet all right like I wash my
they cant be out watching my hair you
know what its not Im gonna treat
myself Im gonna give myself a head bath
I think its a cleanse
head back theres like the baptism it
cleanses your sins away so I think its
a clam is it just like slang for getting
a like a head massage like its so
relaxing that its like beating your
head the meaning of head butt is washing
hair oh well thats what I said but I
thought it was too simple taking things
literally is probably the way to go so
all my invisible assistants here have
calculated the scores and we have a
winner and the winner of this challenge
is me all of you guys did really badly
Im sorry Im gonna take the award by
myself but did I lose them
because I think I changed things around
so you can never really lose if youre
an innovator I did not do well a bit
guttered I lost but you know what I
learnt a lot and I will be using these
next time owners Indian most Indian
slang seems to kind of make sense like
heres the meaning well hey thank you so
so so much for watching this video if
you liked it please give it a thumbs up
and tell us in the conversation down
below what are some other slang terms
that we could make people guess okay and
yeah subscribe to BuzzFeed India for
more videos
Hi Guys Whats up? Thanks a lot for watching Booxoul
Today we are going to talk about
Teri Bhais ki pooch Your Buffalos tail
Ant sant mat Bol Dont talk Rubbish
types of words
In English we call these informal phrases SLANGS
In our country thats India
almost everyone wants to speak English as fluent as they can
but what happens is
while speaking we run out words!
I cant increase your vocabulary in this short video
even if it was a bit lengthier I couldnt because
umm my vocabulary sucks!
So like Teri Bhaiss ki pooch doesnt mean Buffalos tail in English
Similarly there are some words some slangs
which means a bit different than what they seem
So lets see them!!!
The first slang is SICK
We all know what SICK means in general
when someone is ill or something like that
but in English as a Slang it means a bit different
In English as a slang it means that something is very amazing or excellent
for example
She looks sick in that Dress
and I overacted
We just went to Nikhils Party last night I mean it was SICK! I wanna go back again
and I overacted again!!!
The 2nd slang is bingewatch
Dont we all sometimes watch the whole season at once?
Watching one episode after other and again and again
That is what known as bingewatch
For example
I just bingewatched 13 reasons why and I love that show now!
The 3rd slang is ButtDial
Sometimes accidentally we call someone on our phone while its inside our pocket or while sitting
So that call thats an accident is known as buttdial
Hey I think you buttdialed me yesterday
You called me and then it was just noise
The 4th slang is BAIL
We all have heard of this word BAIL at least in Bollywood movies
Someones inside jail? Lets bail him out
But in English its a bit different
In English it means Leaving suddenlyAbrubtly
Suppose you go with your friends to watch cinema and then you realized
Oh FK! I forget to do the homework!!!
So youll say
Hey guys Im sorry Im gonna bail!
The 5th slang is Feeling Blue

so if you cant see or hear me at any point just let me know and we can fix it
um but aside from that um this is our first chat so its so nice to meet you um normally i like
to just ask some questions about you um and like how old youve been learning english give you some
information about me during these first lessons um so we just know a little bit more about each other
but um let me get this pulled up okay so can you pronounce your name for me um its adrija
adrija yes okay and um where are you from um im from india okay what part of india
um i live in the east side well um kolkata
okay so i actually have never heard of the city until today i talked to somebody earlier in
india from the same place really i think so yeah because he was talking about how it was eastern
india and im almost certain that it was the same city um so whats your whats your native language
like living there i know that there are a bunch of different languages in india um i my native
language is bengali but the main language in india is hindi like we all know hindi um but you
know everyone has different native languages like yes in the south there are other languages like
you said that you can like you know hindi as well yes yes do you know any of the other languages or
just like hindi and bengali yeah no hindi bengali and english these are the three languages thats
a good mix um and you can communicate with a lot its like good news thats so cool though so um
okay okay he also spoke moving goalie so now i really think that he was from the same place
but uh how long have you been learning english then
um im learning english from my childhood like from i dont know three years old maybe
okay so youve been learning english for a while do you speak english at home like with your family
um no not really uh but i do speak english with my friends at my school okay so that is very
like some practice yes yes yes um thats cool and then do you how long have you been using gambling
um not not for a long time i would say uh maybe for one month one or two months oh okay okay so
its still new here and then im assuming like are you using it just to practice your conversation
yes just to practice okay well you sound great so far so really thank you yeah
um and so i had another question for you oh youre yes yes im in school right now
um im in class eight
okay can you hear me if those are the same hello i can hear you can you hear me
um yes yes i can hear you now okay can you hear me okay yes i can
yes okay so can you tell me where are you from yeah so im um my name is tori
and im 22 yeah um im from the united states so i am from tennessee which is like the
southeast of the us and i was born there raised there and i stayed there all the way up until
um i graduated college so lived in nashville i lived in one city for my whole life and then for
college i moved to another city in the same state and went to college there um so i studied spanish
and education so i can speak spanish as well um and i lets say oh i graduated last april and then
i worked in the us kind of as like a spanish teacher for a little while and in september
i moved to spain so i live in spain now so right now youre a spain yes yes thats nice its cool
its really cool i grew up somewhere really really small i grew up in a super like super tiny town
and then i moved to madrid which is the capital of spain and it is like a huge city by comparison and
so its been really amazing for me i feel like theres like so much to do and so much to see
all the time um so i really like living here and here i work as an english its i work as like a
language assistant um teaching english and i work with like really really really young children
so i work with fouryearolds and i dont like colors and letters and
how to write their names um all of that different stuff and then im studying
my masters degree here as well so busy busy busy yeah i like um
are an inspiration to me because i also live in a really really small town and yes
i have to go to a huge city after you know i graduate maybe or i have to move to some
huge city afterwards so yes im also a little bit scared about what is going to happen over there
yeah well i was so scared about moving here because i had never visited spain before
but its been fun its its a good experience to like be away from my
family and like have to be independent and so if youre thinking about like studying abroad
or just like going and traveling for a little while um i would definitely recommend
do you know so i know that you said that youre only uh in eighth grade but um do you have idea
what you might want to do when youre older um well not really i say um i would go in the path
of science because i really really love science um but after that i dont know what im going to
become whether in the research line or medical line or i have i will think that in the future
oh yes you have a lot of time you have a lot of time but you said that you like science so do
you like like biology or like chemistry um biology biology is my favorite subject ever thats so fun
i am horrible at science so i really respect that because whenever im trying to think about
how old i was when i had to take biology for the first time i think i was 15 and ive always been
like really good with the rest of my classes and i remember i think i made like a c in my biology
class or something and i was so upset about it because i i just like could not my brain could not
understand some of the stuff that i was learning um now i think its like a little bit more
interesting um my like partner he works in the sciences and hell like explain things to me some
yeah well you know if you have a little interest in it then
yes yes right totally
yes i can hear you i cannot hear you can you hear me oh no i can hear you yes what about now
hello hear me
oh no yes yes can you hear me now okay okay yes yes okay its fine now
what were you saying just like being interested in it do you feel like it
makes it easier for you to like learn some of the stuff because you like it
yes yes of course because you know when youre interested in a subject you automa
automatically get addicted to it and yes it works because like uh thats me in history
that you said you are in biology because like in history like i dont understand that even
a little bit of it what is happening so well yeah you know sometimes i do get a little bit
of interest and i love to read it but most of the time it is like just memorizing the stuffs
yes history is also really hard for me because of the like memorization for us like we would have to
memorize all sorts of like years and oops dates that stuff happened and i okay i could not tell
you now anything that i learned like in history class um but thats cool thats cool that you at
least like have an idea and you know what you like and that kind of thing um because i think whenever
i was in school like when i was your age i had no idea what i wanted to do when i was older so if
you have an idea it like helps kind of guide your path um and you were saying you wanted to move
have you thought about like studying abroad um can you do that in like high school there um no not
really i have not really thought about it right now um i would see where my destiny takes me but
um well lets see what happens because you know if i get some you know there are some scholarships
and all that so if i get that maybe i will move there but maybe after graduation just not afraid
i understand and do you think um what was i gonna ask oh have you ever traveled outside of india
yes yes a lot of places like um china and then europe i have traveled a lot of places in europe
then dubai maldives um then bali singapore yes is awesome thats so fun you traveled to many more
places than i have have you ever visited the us no i havent but im eagerly looking forward to visit
it because you know ive heard a lot about it and i also know a lot geography about it so where are
these popular places and all those so yes i am really looking forward to visit it someday yes
yes no have you ever um visited spain too have you ever visited spain at all no i havent oh
its okay its okay spains a really cool place to visit um i think even after i move away from here
ill probably come back and visit like just like a tourist because its a super super cool country
um thats really cool that youve been to all of those places and i think that like the next
im a teacher i dont think im ever gonna get rich but whenever i save up some money
i would really like to travel to asia um because i are like southeast asia because i talk to so
many people all the time from like japan vietnam like thailand all these different places and for
people in other parts of the world its like super cheap to travel to somewhere like thailand and so
um i need to save up some money and go because in the culture i mean even where youre at in india
its so different than like the culture that i grew up with and it really interests me and um
like being here in spain even its still very westernized so its honestly like some things are
different than they are in the us but some things are and so i would like to visit somewhere thats
like really different you know yes because in india everything is different from the us
like you know the culture is totally different over here our eating styles everything is
different our clothing habits everything asian countries have a lot in common i would say
like you know japan um then thailand india china and all of these they have a little common
but um well id not say that they have a lot of common with the western countries
yes exactly exactly and thats the thing like europe and the us kind of have together but
anyways we only have like 40 seconds but it was so nice to meet you and to talk to you
um yes i hope that you have a wonderful rest of your night
yes you do awesome thank you bye bye

I havent thought about her for a long time
Ans she doesnt miss me
Where is the pickle from Aarya?
It had fungus so I threw it away
What else did you throw away?
My electric shaver is missing too
That got spoilt
You would have got a shock
That didnt happen with your taunts though right?
You know if you didnt insist on being this man child
there would have been no need for me to taunt
I know I know all this lecture
If you know everything you can try to change atleast
What do you mean?  I mean I am fed up
of your childish behaviour
I have a life and Id really like to go and live it
but I am out of such  Hold on
I didnt ask you to do that You are doing it by yourself
In fact it would be better if you dont do it
Yes because its a perfect life
You dont go to work You stay at home and drink
Watching stupid  This is also my house
I am paying the rent for the last four months
Im chasing my dream and it takes time
How would you know about it? You dont have any dreams
Youre living your comfortable life
Dev I did and you know it
Then we got married and life happened
but I knew that I have responsibilities
and we worked together as a team
I know that we are us and we were never just I
Was that supposed to be an explanation?  Oh shut up
Okay lets recall
We met in school and started dating
And then suddenly we got married because that was your right time
Then you wanted to move to US because that was your right time
And you wanted to do a family planning
because that was your bloody right time
Did you ever think that was the right time for me?
Your right time?
You never wanted to marry after being together for seven years
You wanted me to keep waiting around for you
to figure out what your right time was?
I wish I had spent those years in chasing my dreams
I wouldve really  You dont know that Dev
You know everything  I do  Wow!
So you know very well where the cushions have to be kept
because thats how you planned it
Wine glasses have to be clean right?
The bedsheets should be clean crisp
and there shouldnt be grease on it
As per your plan
Well get married at the age of 25 because thats how you planned it
Well plan our family at 29! You know what?
Hell with you and your planning!
You spent your entire life planning!
Have you ever realised?
Have you ever lived those moments with me?
I enjoyed being with you Dev
I enjoyed being married to you
I enjoyed doing up this house
Why do we always end up discussing this?
Because all I wanted was
to watch and enjoy my match
with my friends and my beer
Seeing messages from your reunion group
Thats why I called
Is Deva coming?  Dev said yes So
I guess yes
Hang on!
Woah! Good Lord!

For both of us

And we were in love and we got married

If we go there like this fighting

the most important thing is take care of
your family take care of your parents
the strength lies in your family your
family is your first priority
this is what i believe and i have always
done it and i would suggest you your
i write about startups and i write about
entrepreneurs and they have perhaps some
of the toughest times when they build
their businesses youve done the same
grind too as an actor so you know you
started your life from ground zero and
today i mean i was reading architectural
digest and they said youve got the most
beautiful home in mumbai today so whats
it been like
to go from ground zero to right up there
where it matters
yes its been a
hard journey and its been
a different kind of experience
i dont know from where to start from to
answer your questions
its going to take a lot a lot of time
to talk about it
my formula has been a very different
kind of formula ill tell you something
yes my hard work is a lot in my film
industry ive been working hard since
last 28 years now i finished about ive
finished about
130 films
ive now become a producer since last 10
years ive been producing films
like bhakt
airlift baby
special chabis
and stone and even padman also
i always
wanted to bring you know the most
important thing of my life has been that
i wanted a change every time anybody
tries to put an image on me
i have always jumped to some other image
i never wanted to be in one track
because i always think a change is the
most important thing in anybodys life
because if the person can change himself
he can do many different things like i
started doing romantic films i started
ive done
villains role ive done so many kind of
different kind of roles i didnt i
didnt care about it i just went and
then changes so i just would like to say
the changes is the most important thing
but on top of that
i would
uh bring one thing
whether you believe it or not
but this i will share it with you guys
my success
a lot
and my parents feet ill tell you why
whenever in the morning whenever i go to
i always touch my mothers feet and go
trust me
it is
it has made so much difference in my
career in my life i have been saved by
so many people who are
like a lot of negative energies ive
been saved from
but that is the fact
yes obviously the hard work is the most
important thing change is another thing
but to have a positive aura around you
and that only your parents can bring you
not even god its only your parents who
will bring your positive aura around you
and and care for you
i like to deconstruct when i construct
myself completely then i look at myself
i want to break it
i want to break this whole image i want
to start another construction and build
another one
this is
i would say it is in my mindset this is
what i have followed i never stick to
one particular image
i just want to just keep on innovating
undergoing i know i miss i can be
comfortable by just doing
commercial cinemas like a rowdy rathor
or a house full or this kind of films
but i just want to deconstruct myself
even when i did 20 with rajnee khan sir
im playing a villains role a lot of
people ask me why do you need to play a
villains role why not
what is wrong so i just need to d i ill
i love to deconstruct myself that is it
maam sure
so you know i also see that you probably
the complete man of the industry you
know youre so busy you do four movies
as you said and yet you make sure that
you always spend time with your family
and you always have time for holidays
and i see startups who just get so
engrossed with their work that they
completely forget that they have
families back there they have parents
their children their bi
you know how do you make sure that you
balance it out see ill tell you that is
why the first thing when i started
talking about it i said the most
important thing is take care of your
family take care of your parents that is
the most important thing the strength
lies in your family
the positiveness lies in your family
i work a lot i work
hell of a lot but it is nothing i divide
my work nothing i all i always take
whatever in my life i want to do i do it
with maths
i calculate it
im doing four films a year
im doing about four movies a year
one movie takes about 35 to 40 days
i dont work
i saturday i work only seven to two
two oclock in the afternoon im off
saturday two oclock onwards i dont
sunday i dont work
monday i start working
i work eight hours a day
but in that eight hours i am on the set
i dont move away from the set i dont
go sit in my vanity van
i tell my producer my director that i am
you make me work
eight hours is good enough
because because after eight hours you
know because i have to be in front of
the camera i have to look good i take
one and a half month of holiday with my
family every year
i just put the globe in front of my wife
and ask her i worked a lot you tell me
where you want to go
i do that
so basically what im trying to say is
all you have to do
you have to look at your
family you have to look at your priority
your family is your first priority
once the priority is set properly once
they also know you okay my husband or my
father or my or my brother will after
working he will come and hell spend all
his time here perfectly fine nothing can
go wrong with you guys nothing can go
its a tried and tested thing which i
have done it i have even told a lot of
in my
in my colleagues i have told them and i
have seen changes coming to them
i love the fact that you said that you
have some extreme discipline and that
you follow it and its worked for you
bollywood is known to party its known
its about fun its about excitement so
how do you make sure that your entire
teams your your producers your directors
go actors everybody is in tune with you
theyre insane because when they are
working with me the agreement is so
they have to come early morning properly
time otherwise the agreement will get
you know
thats a good thing to be in a position
where everybody sort of no it is not
even a small producer can do it it is
not that amazing because if you are
taking a chance and if you i always
believe i i always tell everybody
i am an actor
whos a producers actor
i believe what the producer says i have
to do it
and it is important he is my boss but
yeah some of the cases i myself am the
boss of myself you know one thing i like
about the bollywood industry and i think
which all industries need to learn
is that money cannot be tapping you know
money cannot be taboo you cannot grow
your business or yourself without money
having your businesses your products
making money so you know what i would
want you to message out to startups here
today is that making money is really
important i see money is become somehow
a third or a four year plan after they
start a business you know making money
is important
i was working i did films for 50 000
but for i think a long time i must say
for 10 years i worked
not more than about
10 12 lakh rupees uh a movie
so youre the 10th highest paid star in
the world
so uh
so now
but then
i worked hard for it
and it is not necessary i mean you dont
have to run behind money first you have
to run behind your product first you
have to run behind the quality first and
after that things will change you will
realize it
and i think that i i have done that like
that so i cannot tell them anywhere in
any other way

I was watching a Stand up Comedy video on youtube recently
And then I saw a comment on the video By a handle named feministboymanoj
And  the comment read
What is this habit of Stand Up Comedians using abusive words to get laughter?
Act responsible guys Remember
women are also watching these videos
And I also saw a reply to the comment By a handle named lalitha19111954
And the reply read Chup Kar Madarchod
Best thing I have seen on the internet so far
Also I perform in English I dont perform in Hindi
Because I am not a Star Plus kind of a guy
I am more of a Sun TV kind of a guy
Thats what I am One guy continues laughing thinking about Suryavamsam movie
Do you watch it a lot sir?
I come from this small town in Tamil Nadu Called Chennai if you guys know about it
Thats the problem whenever I come out of Chennai
A lot of people think I am a moron
So I always tell them No I am an oxymoron
Because I am a Tamilian who can speak Hindi
But when I say I know Hindi I know Hindi better than most Tamilians do
So I am the kind of guy who goes into a Punjabi Dhaba
And says Agali order Chaar roti chahiye Mostly in Amitabh Bhachans tone
Because Kaun Banega Crorepati is the only Hindi show I ever watched in my life
When I need six rotis I can be Bhaiya che roti chahiye
My problem really is when I need twelve rotis Because that is when I have to say
Bhaiyaaa Ek dho roti chahiye
Audience laughing longer than he expected Okay relax
Audience laughing more See you cannot blame me because
That is how the railway station ladies taught me Hindi
For some reason it is always Agali gaadi number DhoShoonyaEkChaar aa gaya hai
That too with an orgasm every time she says it
Doing poor orgasmic impression of the same numbers
Why cant they just fucking call it Dho hazaar
You Hindi speaking people in the house Have you ever used the word Shoonya
in any of your day to day conversations? No right? It is not just with Hindi
Even when a Tamilian says his phone number in Tamil
It is always like OnbadhuEzhuEttuZEROnaalumoonuZERO
Just because we Indian invented zero
it   become an official word in every damn Indian language
The funniest thing is for a very long time I thought the phrase Ugly gaadi meant
the train is going to be very dirty
Which is apparently always true right?
I thought it was a disclaimer from the Railways department
Saying Our trains are fking ugly please dont enter it
Hindi is one language which always embarrasses me man
I used to work for this company called Amazon And before you guys get any judgemental
I used to work as a Software Engineer there I have to tell this because the last time
I told a lady I work for Amazon She was like Ooooohhhhhhhhhhhh!
Which area do you take care of?
Happens when you look like a real estate agent
I used to go to office in my office cab regularly And one fine day a pretty North Indian lady
was sitting next to me And like an ass I wanted to impress her with
my Hindi So I spoke to the cab waala saying
Bhaiya seedha chalthe signal ke aage left se rukho
And for some reason she smiled at me and said No language would help you bro just shut up!
It is not like I dont try to learn the
language of Hindi That is why most of the times I go to my Hindi
speaking colleagues And try to create small talks with them
Like asking them Kya bhai Kaisa hey aap But as a Tamilian I expect them to understand me
and come up with simple replies Like Acha hai
Bahuth acha hai
Or if they are not so happy they can say
Acha nahi hai But that is when this guy wants to mess up
with me Comes up with big ass dialogues like
Ek gaav mein ek kisaan rakuthatha ki Kabhi Kushi kabhi gam khi Saala kaadoos ki
Ache din aane waale hai
And then I have to go Acha hai
And then I just walk away But most times deep inside I am like Ommaley
Not even staying there
With this level of Hindi I had the audacity to Gurgaon
I was hungry I went to this food centre called Haldirams
It was a self service counter so I got my food coupon
And then I gave my token to the food counter And I was waiting for my turn to be called
And then I realised that these guys were shouting out token numbers in Hindi
And my token number was Eight hundred and Eighty eight
Immediately I was like I am going to starve tonight Let me be ready
But I didnt want to give up So I took
out my google translator And typed 888 in numbers and then I
said Translate to Hindi And google said 888in numbers
I was like Google is stupid man So I tried to be specific
I typed Eight hundred and eighty eight in English
And translated it and google said Aat sau assi aat
For the next five minutes my goal was to remember it
So I started reciting Aat sau assi aatAat sau assi aat Aat sau assi aat
The guys was like Aat sau pachpan I was like NO Aat sau assi aatAat sau
assi aat Aat sau The guy was like Aat sau Athiban
I was like NO Aat sau assi aatAat sau assi aat Aat sau
Athiban is not a number it is just my friends name
Five minutes later my turn came out and the guy shouted
Token number Aataataat
These railway station ladies man I hate them!
I like talking about languages Because language is one thing that unites us
at the same time divides us
I know this because I am a Tamilian who lives in Bangalore
And my roommate in Bangalore is a Kannadiga
from Karnataka Sometimes he tells me
Navin you are in Karnataka you should learn Kannada
Which I completely empathise with That is why I always tell him
Dude I will definitely learn Kannada once I am done with Java and Python
Because if I am not going to learn Java and Python
I am not going to be in the Silicon Valley of India to learn Kannada in the first place right?
But this is why I like South Indian metropolitan cities in general
Because people from different parts of the country come and live here
Be it Bombay or Bangalore
Sometimes even people from outside the country live here
I think that is why there are very less road rages in these cities
Because most of the time if you have to fight with another person on the streets
The common language is English And we Indians are good at a lot of things
Fighting in English is not one among them That is why the maximum quarrel you can see
in English is One guy saying Fuck you
And another guy saying You fuck you
And then both of them fuck off That is the end of the quarrel nobody gets hurt
I have been in fights I have never been like
Hey I am going to kill you carve your chest up with a knife use your skin as furniture
covers make a necklace out of both of your ears and screw your skull through one your eyeballs
Thanks for laughing at that man
It took me three weeks to by heart that one dialogue
Had to download the script of Django Unchained
Sometimes even NRIs who come back from
UK and western countries Even they cant fight in English
Firstly I dont know why they have this American dream a lot of people go to the
US Because I recently went to the US to realise
that there is not much difference between India and these western countries
Except this one thing called the usage of toilet paper
And when I went there I had no difficulty on how to use a toilet paper
Thanks to all the YouTube videos I watched
Thats how you learn things in the internet era I am sorry
But once I was done with all the basic etiquettes
My real confusion was whether to throw the used paper
Into the dustbin or into the toilet commode Because think about it traditionally in India
all the waste paper goes to the dustbin And all the shit goes to the toilet commode
And this thing in my hand is a very weird combination
That is why most of the times I was there I just dropped it on the floor and just ran
away I was just clever I didnt use the same
loo twice on the same day
I also met a friend there a school friend of mine
who has been living there for three years
And he consistently had this fake accent like how people have it
At one point I got really annoyed So I slapped him and said Dude Talk properly
And he shouted OMG! Did you just slap me?
And that is when I realised he was desperately trying to be an American
Because only Americans can do that shit Getting slapped by a person and asking the
same person Did you just slap me?
Any Indians response to a slap is a slap back or a swear word
But this guys response was a rhetorical question
I became angry I slapped him again
And this time he started sounding like an African dude
Yo man please dont hit me like that!In poor African accent
So I slapped him again And then he started sounding like a Sheikh
from Saudi Arabia And that is when I realised that with every slap
This guy is actually coming back to his home country
One slap at a time
The last time I slapped him so hard He became so Indian that he started chasing
me shouting Lavadekebal And then I had to run for my life
But I was talking about road rages Because I recently got into a road rage in
Bangalore I was on my bike and I dashed into this car
And I immediately realised it was my mistake So I was ready to apologise to this guy
So I came out my bike And this guy came out of his car
The problem is even before starting to listen to me
He started shouting at me in Hindi And I was like If you are going to shout
at me in your mother tongue I am going to shout at you in my mother tongue
And I started shouting at him in Tamil Which went on for the next two minutes
After which both of us realised This is not helping either of us
Why are we even doing this? He also probably realised it
So he was like Dude can we fight in English? Because I dont know Kannada
I understand The South Indian in me got furious
I wanted to tell him Dude this is not Kannada this is Tamil
These are very different South Indian languages But the Bangalorean in me told him something
That I always wanted to tell people in Bangalore So I looked at his straight into his eyes
I told him This is Karnataka you should learn Kannada
He was like Sure Thank you man and got into the car
Alright guys thats been my time you guys have been a fantastic audience Thanks for listening!

Tell me son why is your head down?
You used to laugh a lot why are you silent now?
People front of our doors with boards
I know very well who they are and their motives
Among them some are here to shine silver
Some want to grab you and pull you down
Some are framewhores
Some wants the spotlight by saying your name
Tough times always come to strong men
Dont fall back the world will enjoy it
And the path you are walking on
Youll get high rated defamation
Everyday controversy will be created
With the excuse of religion youll get a debate
If you speak the truth youll get 295 Criminal code 295  intent to insult religion
And if you are successful then youll get hate
Lots of people grouped together to save our culture
Literally everybody gets up and gives lectures
And i feel like even god has surrendered
When i read newspapers in the morning
Stay quite son dont reveal the secrets
Leaders here deserve to be shot
And people who name their kids John and Steve
Are trying to become saviours of our mother language
These arent lies they are the facts of here
Robbers are disguised as social workers
And those that loot people in the attire of truth
They will all be punished soon
People throw rocks at trees filled with fruits
Within minutes they reach the mothers womb
Whos dog whos a pimp and whos evil
Here these certificates are given on facebook
Politicians give bribes to get votes from them
They take their votes and the voters are slapped
Dont know where their conscience is then
They dont speak they are shameless
People applaud when they see you fall
They keep long beardsReligious Tradition and spew hatred
And what is the difference in your mother and his People using mothers to insult
They will learn this a bit late
You are here because of your dedication
They arent here taking pictures because of your face
How much someone here believes in god
People judge it based off of their actions
You may have bent but you never blow down
You have a turban on your head you are not bald
Ask one thing from these contractors of religion
Religion is ours not just yours alone
Get rid of dirty politics from your heart
At least leave people alone to go to the temple
You wont find any kids with long hair Religious tradition
Other wise you will soon see those days
Illitrate people run todays media
They tell the same lie over and over again
They sit with women and gossip
And call the show Chajj da Vichar Informative Discussion
All day and night they look for drama
Without reason they quarrel with you
They condemn you 24 hours a day
Yet they know all of your songs by heart
Even though the crowd is hard on you
They yell at you without reason
Remember one thing my son
Your father is very proud of you
Youve been suppressed the world is in mistaken
Get up my wrestler son moosewala
If you continue speaking the truth in your songs
You will find an educated new generation
sorry just became a puddin
no good
Hi guys and welcome to French Guy Cooking
Today  an explosion of indian tangy flavors trapped in the most reassuring english Tradition
Plus !
Ill bring you the most undisputable proof that you have the power to work miracles
Lets make the unexpected but stunning Palak Paneer Hinglish Pie
You are about to make your own cheese
How you feel about it ?
The Paneer cheese is insanely fast and dead simple to make
Paneer is a fresh cheese quite common in India
It is made by curdling heated milk with an acidic liquid
It tastes quite soft but it is milky and nutty
In a big pan over medium high heat pour 2 liters of whole milk and 1 cup of cream
Stir it from time to time
When there is serious foam forming
Remove the milk form the heat and add half a cup of apple cider vinegar
This is where things get exciting !
The reaction just takes a few minutes
The milk will separate into curds and whey
Now get yourself a piece of cloth
This can be called a cheesecloth or a muslin
Just take whatever cloth you find
Place the cloth in a strainer over the sink
Pour the liquid in
Carefully Make a knot
Now put weight on it
It will squeeze the excess of water out
The Paneer Cheese will be ready when we need it
A good pie is all about a good filling
For this one we ll use Fish and Spinach
What ?
Do you remember we are trying to gain subscribers ?
Well I do and thrust me
you wont find any watery spinach or bland fish in this recipe
Instead think of outstanding explosive flavors like mint ginger garlic lemon !
First things first
Lets marinate the fish
Cut 4 fillets of trout into big chunks
Season well with salt and pepper then place them in a bowl
Add a Drizzle of oil
A drizzle of honey
A crush of garlic
A gratted thumb of ginger
The juice of half a lemon
And all the zest you can get from it
A sprinkle of chopped mint leaves cant do any harm
Let it rest while we prepare the greens
From now on we will use an ovenproof frying pan
You can also use a skillet
Or a frying pan and a pie dish
Over medium high heat a big knob of Butter
Add a thumb of gratted ginger
2 crushed cloves of Garlic
Chop 3 onions
2 3 minutes should do it
Add loads of fresh spinach and let them fall down in the frying pan
Spinach will litteraly vanish in the pan
So When I say loads I mean tremendous amounts of spinach
Like  fuck i shouldnt put that much
A good big pinch of Salt pinch of pepper
When almost all the water has evaporated we can move on to the next step
Lets build the pie up
Two rolls of puff pastries on the board
Parchment paper under it
Heavy Sprinkling with an indian spices mix
Coriander seeds
Cumin seeds
Pepper corn
A bit of cinnamon
Fat is always a good carrier of taste because many flavors do not dissolve in water
In this case we use the fat of the puff pastries to retain the indian spices
Thoroughly rub to the puff pastries
On one roll sprinkle breadcrumbs
They will suck out the excess of moisture during baking
Spread the onions and the spinach
Carefully slide it in the same pan we used earlier
We are baking it in the frying pan for two reasons
One It is convinient
Second its unexpected
People are gonna get curious about it and even more when theyll discover whats inside
Next add the drained chunks of fish
Time to use the paneer cheese
Unwrap it slice it and place it on top
Fold the edges towards the center
Place the second roll on top spiced side down
Here comes a cool part
We are forming the pie not by sealing it but by folding it like a bed sheet
why ?
How many pies have you sealed in your life ?
And how many beds sheets have you folded ?
Gently Push the edges back in the pan under the first layer
Prick the pastry so that steam can escape
And finally brush the pie with milk
BOOM !
In a preheated oven until you achieve a nice golden brown finish
There we have it  The unexpected Palak Paneer Hinglish Pie !
Outside the shiny crust is crispy as hell and encrusted with bold indian flavors
Inside its all about freshness and moisture
Tell a story  Its no boring pie !
its journey made of warm blankets and dream countries

Bye Bye !
today Im going to take up a very common
problem that a lot of English learners
face the problem is that they translate
their sentences from Hindi to English
whenever they are trying to speak
something in English and I know this
because of course it has happened to all
of us at some point of our lives
whenever we were trying to learn a new
we definitely faced this issue because
we are habitual to thinking in our
native language now the issue is that in
that process of translation a lot of
time is lost and the moment just
vanishes most of the times we lose the
moment the translation takes a lot of
energy a good effective conversation
requires snappiness it requires to think
on your toes that charm that is required
now lets address a few issues that are
connected to this problem is this good
or bad it is bad should it happen no it
should not happen will it happen yes it
will happen will it go away yes it will
go away Im going to tell you how it is
going to go of it let us first
understand one thing it is not something
that happens in absolute that either you
are going to translate or youre not
going to translate at all no it is
something that will happen more in the
beginning and then eventually decrease
when the time passes and when your
practice happens it is going to decrease
to a very low level and then eventually
it will completely vanish here we agree
on one thing it is a continuum its not
going to happen with the click of a
finger so how will it exactly happen
Ill show you this is you translating
every sentence and this is you who does
not have to translate anything at all so
how will this happen right now this is
like zero so zero and right now this is
you okay so you are translating
everything once you start practicing
okay this is you practicing giving it
time giving it a lot of energy this
keeps on coming down and as this comes
down this keeps on increasing little by
little little by little and then again
it keeps coming down and this comes here
okay now youre 50 through
eventually what will happen this you are
going to grow and this you is going to
become small and eventually this is what
it looks like you become this from this
lets talk about your instincts lets
talk about your intuition do you know
how to drive Im sure most of you
already know how to drive so do you
remember your first day are driving the
person must be telling you about the
clutch the brake the gears how to keep a
little distance with the other cars and
which lane to take etcetera etcetera at
that time Im sure it must have felt
cumbersome it must have felt difficult
but now when you drive dont you think
you dont have to think about it you
dont have to actually apply your mind a
lot of people drive listening to music
lot of them drive talking on the phone
which is absolutely wrong but they still
do so that means there comes a point in
your life when you dont have to any
further think when you have to drive you
dont have to think about driving that
is what I meant similarly it will happen
for any other skill whatever youre
trying to learn it will become automatic
initially it always faces friction but
when you keep providing it the fuel of
every now and then youre giving that
signal to your mind that youre going to
do it youre going to do it youre going
to keep practicing youre going to keep
doing it youre going to keep working on
your language eventually your brain will
stop resisting the change it will start
accepting it ok and your brain is going
to actually start supporting you you
will not have to consciously try to
speak in English English is going to
flow out of your mouth it will just flow
like that now the point is how do we do
that ok I will answer this question with
another question you tell me how much
time in the last 30 days have you
actually given to learning English
have you actually given it 30 years in
the last 30 days and if I have to give
you a figure and I can assure you that
these many number of hours if you put in
into learning English you will
definitely be
able to speak proper English Im not
saying advanced level English just a
basic level English you will be able to
speak with fluency if I give you a
figure will you be working on that I
have a figure for you Im giving you a
figure of 1000 RS 1000 okay if you give
it 1000 hours you will be able to speak
fluent English basic fluent English that
is a very good book that I read just a
few years ago the name of the book is
mastery and it was written by Robert
Greene mastery has this point that when
you give something ten thousand hours
not one ten thousand hours you come to a
position that you are an expert of that
particular skill and now you are in a
position to teach that skill to other
people Im not asking for ten thousand
hours from you because we dont have to
become experts we just need basics Im
going to call it the 1000 hours rule if
you give it your 1000 hours I am
promising you you will be able to speak
proper fluent English with confidence
and without hesitation
one last fundamental that Im going to
talk about with you today is effort
expectation ratio the name is itself
self explainatory
how much is your effort and how much is
your expectation the ratio right now is
pretty disturbed the effort that youre
putting in is around 10 which is pretty
low and the expectation that you have
out of yourself is pretty high its
somewhere around 90 we need to maintain
this ratio a little we need to make the
effort more and expectation little so
the ratio instead of being one is to
nine should be nine is to one the effort
should be 90 and your expectation
should be 10 stop expecting too much
out of yourself at such an early stage
because as I said unless you give it
your 1000 hours no big thing is going to
happen for you and as a good teacher I
have a homework for you like always that
you have to listen to me carefully and
you have to do this you have to
in front of the mirror okay lets first
break the hesitation to ourselves and
then we will talk about breaking the
hesitation to the outside world so you
have to go stand in front of the mirror
of your room your washroom anywhere and
you have to speak to yourself for ten
minutes okay ten minutes thats all I
ask you for and once you do that come
back to the video comment done simple
keeping a record of your own growth is
very difficult its important that
somebody else is watching over you you
can keep doing this in your regular days
keep doing it daily and keep informing
me Ill be more than happy to know tell
me if you liked todays video personally

Instagram because I post a lot of stupid
