HELLO FRIENDS MY NAME IS GAURAV
YOU ARE WATCHING TECNICAL GURUJI
LETS START
Freinds MY FIRST YOUTUBE VIDEO WAS UPLOADED ON OCTOBER 2015 I AM UPLOADING VIDEOS FROM 2 YEARS I HAVE NOT ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE ABOUT YOUTUBE
Normally we dont attend many events but
today would be the first time well be attending an event
with many YouTubers and creators
It would be quite exciting to see
This is the Nas Summit
This is why were back in Dubai
This is the largest gathering of international content creators
in the last 2 years!
This time our hotel is quite close to the metro station
so well take the metro for the first time
and see how Dubais metro is
Who actually cycles here?
Therere so many cycles
Look at that
Emirates Tower
Theres even a gold class on this train
Book it! Oh you did not book it?
Its weird Oh true
So overall this metro is quite similar to Delhi metro
So many things are the same
The visuals that you can see from the train
What happened? Keep going
I shouldnt be filming in such crowded places
It attracts too much attention
Ill be filming today okay? Great
We found Mohit and Sandhya on the way
Hi! Hi!
Oh wow this is the hall where everyone will sit
I was wondering in a hotel how is there a place for 700 people
It is more crowded than I expected it to be
There are so many creators
And several people actually recognise us
Snacks snacks Snacks?
Yeah Okay
Food food
We have no idea about whats going on here
Who are the ones getting such an energetic welcome?
Okay so my name is Matt and this is Belik
The game were playing apply for a visa in some cases
find a hotel and come here
to learn with other people that are just like you
Thank you for coming here
It sounds like an Apple presentation
youll see in India
Greenlands biggest YouTuber is also here
And she won the Biggest Creator in Greenland
with ten thousand followers
do you know why?
because fifty thousand people live in Greenland
Thats 20 of the country
Do you know the Worlds Biggest Fish YouTuber?
Yeah if it is Graham Stepan I know
Its Casey Neistat
40year old married guy with 2 babies at home
Thats what my life is right now
Theres also a pool party in this hotel
And it is a special hotel because
it gets a truly amazing view of Burj Khalifa
So we met Ranveer Allahbadia aka Beer Biceps
Hes really hyper today Is this the vlog?
This is a video now for our vlog
because we havent been filming a lot
so I was thinking
So how is it going? Are you having fun?
Im tripping out
This is how Julis puts her voice in the vlog and all that its crazy
Love it
Okay Im telling you hes so hyper
Look at this what am I supposed to think about this?
Theres some serious bromance going on
Everything youve seen on Beer Biceps vlogs
hes even more hyper in real life Yeah
Because Dhruvs sexiness is 100 times more in real life
He is quite sexy online
but he is even sexier in real life
Im just expressing my man crush
I mean I dont disagree its just
Another interesting thing
normally the fans that I come across are from India
but here I met a viewer from Myanmar
Im interested in the topic that you are saying like geopolitics
and since Im interested in that topic
I just know the topic that you are saying
but I dont understand you
So I have been following you Yeah yeah but you can use subtitles
Yeah yeah Yeah very interesting
Today is the second day of the Summit
The last day for us
we arent staying long
We have a flight tomorrow
I have a presentation today
Well not a presentation really Ill be on the stage to speak for a bit
Its a panel discussion
Not a presentation
I swear that was such a brain fog
Im backstage before the panel discussion
Technical Guruji and Carryminati are already here
And you can see Mostly Sane here
Lets begin
Vlog section
Make sure you turn your phone towards the people the viewers want to watch
The video would turn out great
I have some really good people with me
and the event is running 15minutes late
but a backstage video is important
so lets talk for a while
How are you feeling in Dubai?
Its great its fun so many things are happening all around
Im not sure whats happening
but it was fun it was awesome
lets see what happens right now
Did he know this question was coming?
No he didnt
Everyone on my vlog has to speak fast lets go Dhruv
What should I say?
Today tell us something about Dubai But you have to speak fast
I have explored Dubai for a while
No wait wait wait
faster faster
With hands You have to speak fast
Actually Ill tell you a secret I speak very slowly
And I speed up the videos later
Really? Yeah
Im the opposite people have to slow down my video to watch it
This is Technical Gurujis phone
This phone deserves an unboxing video
Whats on here?
The theme here is Space
These pieces 123 These 6 pieces here
these are pieces of meteorites from Mars and the Moon
Really? Yeah really
And the theme is space you can see the rings of a planet
Plus theres a quote by Albert Einstein here
This is a watch that runs Wow
For example its 250 now
Its 250 here
And then heres my logo
this is all titanium
this is my name here
this is the only one in the world
This is all solid gold You designed all of this?
No it was by the company that made it Caviar
Oh wow
This is solid gold?
Yeah thats why its so heavy
Hi So youre gonna have your panel discussion
Are you nervous at all?
Because Im nervous on your behalf
No its not a very complex topic or something
But its been a long time since Ive been on a stage
The last time was with Kunal Kamra in 2019?
In Amsterdam?
Amsterdam yeah
Since its been a long time Im getting some stage fright
Its easier to speak in a video
But to speak on a stage is tougher in comparison
This was a small backroom
Like they show in films
a place for actors to get ready
We had gathered here
and then this is the way to the backstage
All the best! Thank you
That looks like the backstage
Ill be going up on a stage after a long time
Guess whos coming on the panel now
There he is!
Hi guys my name is Dhruv Rathee
and I make explanatory videos on a variety of topics
and I have around 7 million subscribers
Things change like that!
In 2 days the world will change
I will say that probably the only thing you can say for sure
is that more and more people are going to come on the internet right now
So if its only 50 of the Indian population
soon you will see 6070
Once more people come then
you will see that there are different markets within India also
based on the language they speak
Welcome to the Second Day of the Nas Summit!
Okay again
I hate making videos
1 2 3!
Perfect! Okay cut
Thank you so much for the amazing
There we go Ranveer all ready
Clinging to Dhruv again
Hes stealing my husband
Your love is back!
Group hug group hug group hug!
Look at the amount of cameras here
How dare Ranveer steal my husband?
Today is the last day of the Summit
But unfortunately we wont be attending
Because we have a morning flight
Even the passport checking is so futuristic here
you just need to scan there and it automatically recognises your face
You dont need to do anything else
Where do you think were going?
See if you can guess

Hey guys this is Colonel Singala here for SuperSaf TV
Saf here on SuperSaf TV
And its the one youve all been waiting for
the endofyear SuperSafStyle collaboration
where we find out which 2023 smartphones
some of your favorite YouTubers choose to use
and are taking with them to 2024
Now as always there will be two parts to this video
In this video we will be looking at just smartphones
But in the next video
well have a bit of a rewind
and look at the best tech of 2023
not including smartphones
If you want to be one of the first to see that
then be sure to subscribe and hit that bell icon
so you dont miss it
Right to kick things off
which smartphone do I choose to use?
Well I have two sim cards
one in an iPhone and one in an Android phone
The iPhone its very very simple
Its the big one its the iPhone 15 Pro Max
For me
this still has the best and most consistent camera package
for photos and videos
Performance has been great with the A17 Pro
Excellent battery life
and finally finally USB type C
so I dont have to carry around multiple cables
especially with my Android smartphones
And now my Android smartphone does change
throughout the year
depending on what Im reviewing
But the device that my sim card keeps going back into
was actually one that released early in the year
and that is of course the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra
Now yes it looks just like the S22 Ultra
But the fact that it still holds up almost a year on
is a testament to how good it is
Its a great allrounder with excellent cameras
The best extended zoom on any smartphone
And this year we had the 8 Gen 2 across the board
no split between Qualcomm and Exynos
Thats me lets see what the others have chosen
My favorite smartphone of this year
is a really clear and obvious choice
You saw it a mile away
Its the iPhone 15 Pro
Honestly this phone is incredibly solid
in every possible way
I mean that
Not only is the build quality terrific
we finally got USBC
And for me I spend a lot of time using this
as my main shooter
not only for photos but also for video
And the fact that I can walk into an event
or pretty much anywhere Im going with just this phone
and capture all the content I need is such a game changer
The iPhone have always been good for video
but the screen the performance
like theres basically nothing I can really complain about
with this
and that is an incredibly impressive thing
So I love the Z Flip
but honestly the iPhones beginning
to become my main gadget like period right now
Saf you ever think of doing this roundup at a time of year
when Im not utterly fried and completely insane
with exhaustion?
What smartphone do I use?
All of them
But hinges are preferred
and in that category
the OnePlus Open is the one I would choose
if you made me pick just one in the largeformat category
And in the flipphoneclamshell category
the Motorola Razr Plus
or on your side of the ocean the Razr 40 Ultra I think
Thats what the thing is the nicer one the red one
the leather one
And I carry them together
because Im just that perverted
And I dont have either one with me right now
because Im using other phones I would rather not use
so I can do my job
Thanks for the shade by the way
And my pick for this years smartphone is this
the all new Samsung Galaxy Z Flip5
especially in this new bespoke yellow color option
Now this phone is quite an improvement from the last years
because now what we have is a full immersive screen
on the outside
capable of running almost any app that you want
The phone feels fresh
Now with the zerogap hinge
I mean the form factor is quite improved
And considering its a small tiny phone
good for all the fun good for all the eyeballs
And I mean this is my pick for this year
It has been a great year for phones
but if I had to pick only one
it would be the iPhone 15 Pro Max
Sure its got the looks
new materials and more powerful telephoto
but what Ive liked most is performance
Ive used iPhones for years as a Bcamera
but LOG video combined with that Blackmagic Camera app
has made me a believer in a phone becoming my Acamera
at some point
Same thing with gaming
where the words console quality
have been tossed around a lot with smartphones
But this is the first phone to actually pull it off
I think the word Pro fits the name now more than ever
Saf again thank you so much for having me
and welcome to my favorite smartphone of 2024
Its the OnePlus Open and close
Open and close is back
Yes the OnePlus Open
this is the most freshest phone ever
Because you know what?
I can open and close
plus we have that very sexy camera bump
and this very nice display of faux leather made from petrol
I love petrol
Anyway this phone is smooth its vibrant
big screen great camera great for multitasking
so I can indistinct and enjoy myself
So Colonel Singala signing out
open and close
Colonel Singala laughs
Take it!
You know I love my iPhone
And for most of this year
Ive been rocking the iPhone 14 Pro Max
Of course last September after the iPhone event
I switched to the 15 Pro Max in natural titanium
The cameras on this phone are excellent
but I especially love this brushed titanium finish
Its lightweight and even matches my Oura Ring
and Apple Watch Ultra 2 with my titanium strap from Nomad
Hey there guys its Mr Q from Raqami tv here
Another year another wrinkle
You see Im a big fan of the Samsung Fold5
However this has taken over
This is the OPPO Find N3
You see I love how slim this is
I love the sharp edges
just the flat surface is really awesome
Its got a really lovely screen as well
Plus of course open it up
and then you can see that splash in your face
Guys the software on this is pretty awesome
when it comes to multitasking
I can go ahead and just open up loads of different apps
at the same time
and see them basically full screen
And its cheaper than the Fold5
Now when it comes to an iOS device
obviously were going to have to choose this
the iPhone 15 Pro
Not the Pro Max
because Im actually Team Mini
This is a pretty nice phone
First of all the titanium little rounded edges
just feel really nice to hold in the hand
It definitely feels lighter as well
Also dont forget that weve got USBC
which means that finally we can use one cable
to rule them all
Guys those are my two devices
Boom and boom!
All right?
Take care
air whooshing
And just as I was editing this video
we have hit 2 million subscribers
Thank you to everybody for subscribing
If you havent already do consider joining the 2 million
Lets get back to the video
Hey its Justine here on SuperSaf TV
So the phone that I have been using in 2023
other than my iPhone 15 Pro Max
yeah I know
I mean its still a surprise like Hi
I have an I in front of my name
I am who I am just let me be
the Pixel 8 Pro
I have been loving this phone so much
My sister and I actually did a really fun livestream review
with Google this year
So that was a lot of fun to do
But Ive really been loving the phone
Not only do I just love the color
but just this design
it just feels different it feels unique
And Ive always been a huge fan
of the way that the Pixels look
And of course its deep integration with Google
and all of the things that theyre doing
with their AI initiative
I am so here for it
Hey guys Ashwin from C4ETech on SuperSaf TV
and my favorite phone this year has got to be the Nubia Z50
Well technically it did launch five days before 2023
but I got it this year
and its the one that surprised me the most
An 8 Gen 2 for 300something dollars right around launch
I went in with very tempered expectations
but what I ended up getting
was a solid phone I enjoyed using
It even had a unique 35 millimeter equivalent lens
paired with a solid sensor
with good software a very ergonomic form factor
a faux leather back
that let you actually use the phone naked
I mean this phone the Nubia Z50
I feel its the perfect example
of a product punching way over its weight class
Another year has gone by
and Im here to tell you what my favorite smartphone
that I used all year is
and its two phones
On one hand it is the iPhone 15 Pro Max
cause its the iPhone
the sort of the best of everything
But the other phone thats been in my pocket
since it came out
that I think is going to be my phone well into 2024
my sweet foldy boy the OnePlus Open
I love the aspect ratio
I love the screen love the technology
Its not perfect
but its really close
when it comes to the world of foldables
And for the past 13 years Ive been an Android user
But I decided to give iPhone a chance
and I have been doing so for the past three months
However Im switching back to Android
Very long story short
I can get more done on Android with less taps
and I can schedule text messages on Android
which is important to me and not a feature the iPhone has
And I dont really have a daily phone that I use
I try to switch into whatever phone
that Im doing a video on next
But I will say that one phone
that I keep thinking about wanting to use
is the Google Pixel Fold
Its shape just kind of reminds me
of a Moleskine notebook in the best way
And its just so nice to have Pixel cameras
and all that entails on a folding phone
Its something I feel like we all just have always wanted
if only the battery life didnt suck as much as it did
Maybe theyll do better with the next one
And for my 2023 smartphones
Ive been rocking the iPhone 15 Pro Max in natural titanium
as well as the Google Pixel 8 Pro
I love having the fivetime telephoto
I love all of the AI features and best take on the Google
And Im always rocking an iPhone
So there you have it
Thats what Ive been rocking as my main devices in 2023
Now obviously theres been a ton of great phones this year
But for me what Ive been carrying in my pockets
well theres two
This guy this is the OnePlus Open
which I reckon is the best foldable phone
you can buy right now
I absolutely love this thing
And also the iPhone 15 Pro Max
which Im recording this on in 4K cinematic mode
I just wish there was a 4K 60 mode
so I can then slow it down afterwards
to get those nice slowmo shots
But yeah mostly for video and also the ecosystem
the iPhones been my main phone this year
So were talking smartphones
Favorite phone of the year for me
theres a lot to pick from
I think weve seen all of them come out by this point
And I think my favorite one is the one
that Im going back to daily driving
after testing all the other phones
which right now for me is the Pixel 8 Pro
Lot of software features on this one
Marques giggles
Its not really about the hardware
its got nice hardware too
But its so much software
to the point where if you live in a region
where not all of the software features are enabled
its a notably worse phone
But I live in a region
where I do have all the software features and theyre great
So I like this phone a lot
So there we have it
the smartphones
that some of your favorite YouTubers choose to use
202324 edition

friends enough for this video
thanks for watching if you have any suggestion so please comment down below
if havent like and share this video
so now like share and must subscribe channel
cause i come with these type of amazing videos for you regularly
enough for today guys Jaihind and Vandemateram
Welcome everybody to Chai pe Charch Chai with Sai
Where I will be giving my heavily biased opinions on mildly interesting topics
So our first topic of the day is Amit Bhadanas new music video Parichay
Amit Bhadana is the biggest Indian Youtuber with over 13M subscribers
Now Im not going to forcefully roast Amit Bhadana just for the sake of it
The music was good and the production quality was amazing
Its one of the most wellproduced videos in Indian Youtube
But the lyrics were a bit repetitive
Who gives an introduction for 7 minutes? It doesnt take 7 minutes for an introduction
This is not a roast this is more like a Saute Im just going to share my opinions
The most interesting visual I found in the music video was when a hater is holding a phone and seeing a photo of Amit Bhadana hospitalised and laughing on it
So he is trying to show that his haters make fun of him being hospitalised
Thats not true Your haters make fun of you because of your content
Please dont be so arrogant But the music video was good
And just in case you dint realise that Amit Bhadana has worked hard he makes sure you know that
I have worked hard
Wow nice everyone should work hard
I got the point you have worked hard No doubt
Okay I got that you worked hard everyone works hard What is your point?
To hell with your Parichay
On this music video CarryMinatis response was this
Yes Amit Bhadanas Parichay song is great He has worked hard
And BB ki Vines said this Very good He has worked hard
This is just my personal opinion Im not saying that this is the truth
Looking at this reaction it feels that this is the kind of reaction you give when you dont like something but you still give a diplomatic compliment so that the person asking it doesnt feel bad
You have worked hard nobodys denying that
But even Amir Khan worked very hard to make Thugs of Hindustan
This video has the humble brag feels throughout Jake Paul will be proud
Its a really good music video I will not roast just for the sake of roasting
But it was a bit narcissistic I wont deny that
More than an introduction it was more like a CV that Amit Bhadana made for Bollywood
Because few weeks ago he uploaded a 40 min long sketch
Looking at that it seems like he is telling Bollywood that see I can make films as well as songs
I sincerely hope that Amit Bhadana makes it into Bollywood
But it will be a very sad day for the Indian Youtube if that happens Indian comedy Youtube scene will die
I made children and parents laugh I made family friendly content
Also credit where it is due in Amit Bhadanas recent videos he has reduced the amount of misogynistic content So I will apprecitate that
Maybe he saw my roast video maybe not but that doesnt matter
What matters is that he is improving
But nobody can deny Amit Bhadanas success You can question his content but you cant deny his smartness
That music video got 1M Likes in just one day
Congratulations to Amit Bhadana lets move on to our next topic
I always forget to announce this
I have made a subreddit of mine rSaimanSays
So please submit memes funny videos and other mildly interesting stuff so that I dont have to struggle to find content
Our next topic everybody Technical Guruji exposed
Now I respect Tehcnical Guruji a lot because he uploads 2 videos a day
And he is doing that since the past 23 years
But a Youtuber called TechStar Shahrukh has exposed Technical Guruj saying that he is biased
Technical Guruji is the leading Hindi technology channel and he uploaded a video where he did a bend test of the phone Redmi Note 7
So the things about a bend test is that you have to apply pressure to the center of the phone to test the durability of the phone
What Technical Guruji did is that he applied pressure to the edge of the phone
This phone is breaking into 2 pieces This is not a strong device
The funny thing about this is that he applied so much pressure that the bench shakes
Youtuber TechStar Shahrukh says that Tehcnical Guruji did this bend test and broke the phone as a revenge to Xiaomis MDs tweet
People are saying that this tweet by Manu Kumar Jain who is the MD of Xiaomi was indirectly targeted to Technical Guruji
And Technical Guruji did not like this and that is why he did such an extreme bend test om Redmi Note 7 which is owned by Xiaomi
TG is saying that the reason why he did such a harsh bend test on this phone is because this phone claimed that is is that tough
If any Youtuber does this test bend test there is a simple answer for that and thats a publicity stunt
Breaking a phone is easy anyone can do that
Not necessary that if the phone is strong you cant break it A man has a alot of strength
If you have decided to show that the phone breaks in the video you can do it
You can make this video and then this video can go viral
A lot of people are saying that technical guruji has sold out and he is biased towards Samsung
If Technical Gurujis channel gets shut down then who will say Chaliye Shuru Karte Hai??? Lets Start
Then we will have to Chaliye band karte hai Lets stop Im not ready for that
Please TG I hope you have a good explanation Im rooting for you
This tea gets cold very quickly in winter
So our next topic is Pewdiepie vs Tseries Wow it feels like December again I havent spoken about this topic since a long time
SuperBowl is one of the biggest sporting events in the world and definitely Americas biggest sporting event
And there was a lot of hype that Mr Beast is going to advertise Pewdiepie on that show
The SuperBowl show happened yesterday and MrBeast somehow promoted Pewdiepie but people were underwhelmed
Mr Beast and his team went to SuperBowl and they wore TShirts saying Subscribe to Pewdiepie That was funny but
A lot of people thought that Mr Beast was going to buy billboards or a TV commercial during the broadcast
In my opinion it wasnt that bad because ESPN tweeted this picture I dont know who Stephen Gostkowski is
But in the picture you can clearly see Sub To Pewdiepie tshirts in the audience
And im pretty sure that ESPN tweeted this picture just because it had Sub to Pewdiepie in it
So i guess in the end this strategy definitely worked Mr Beast is smart
Also the subgap was 29000 yesterday and most of the Indians were very excited that TSeries is finally going to take over Pewdiepie
But as it always happends the sub gap increased to almost 150000
Mainly because Pewdiepie did a livestream playing Fortnite which he hasnt done before
and also VoiceOverPete and KeemStar did a livestream which might have helped a bit
I think this battle is going to go on forever And Im a proud insiderinfiltrator whatever my post is in the 9 YO army
Also when popular Indian rapper Raftaar was asked who does he support between TSeries vs Pewdiepie
He said that he supports Salil Jamdaar
So Salil Jamdar made a disstrack on Carryminati Pewdiepie and Tseries His diss on Tseries is really damn good
And Raftaar said he supports Salil Jamdar Im happy that a superstar like Raftaar is not being a sheep and supporting Tseries because Patriotism
And of course Amit Bhadana Harsh Beniwal and Ashish Chanchlani have been promoting TSeries on their Social Medias
TSeries is very close to becoming Indias No1 channel and I want everyone to subscribe to them
I have worked with them they are great people TSeries values artists they respect artists
You messages and comments have been telling me that TSeries is going to be the worlds biggest channel
So subscribe to TSeries so that when someone asks which is the highest subscribed channel in the world people will say TSeries
Then people will ask that where is it from people will say India So that will be a proud moment for us
I hope after few years when Youtube is dominated by corporations these individual Indian Youtubers will realise that they are digging their own grave
If you keep supporting companies like this in a few years no one will care about individual creators
Also ending this video with a very wholesome news which happened on reddit
So there is this subreddit called rRoastMe
On that one 17 year old Russian teenager posted this photo
So the concept of this subreddit is that people post their pictures holding a card which says roast me
They get roasted pretty badly but when this guys posted his picture things were different
If you see this photo normally people are very enthusiastic in their photos but this guy looks very sad
Its really very sad but people realised that

Hey whats up guys MKBHD here on Super Saf TV
This is iJustine on Super Saf TV
Hey guys this is Gaurav better known as
Technical Guruji on Super Saf TV
Hi Im Michael Josh for Super Saf TV
Whats going on guys I am Jenna Ezarik on Super Saf TV
Hey there guys its Mr Q friendly
neighborhood Qatari on Super Saf TV
Hey guys its Krystal on Super Saf TV
Hey guys this is Austin Evens on Super Saf
and it is dub dub DC my friends
Which is apparently like what the cool kids call it
I dont know
Whats up guys Saf here on SuperSaf TV
and weve just finished WWDC which was
crazy packed with lots and lots of stuff
Lets go and find out what the reactions
from some of my friends have been
Man that was a lot that was a lot of of a lot of
announcements in a short amount of
not even a short amount of time it was two hours
It was rapid fire like every single time like
a new screen popped up it would disappear
in like two seconds because they would have
so much information that was just happening so quickly
Dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub
Well you know dub dub is a software show
but I was always excited its always exciting
when there hardware and we got that today
I mean after how many years?
13 14 15 16 17 18 six years of waiting!?
We now have a new Mac pro so thats
pretty exciting for creators especially
Okay not gonna lie when I first saw it
it looked like a cheese grader
I was like is this a new kitchen appliance?
But the power behind the Mac Pro
is absolutely incredible
Everything man but I liked the Mac Pro of course
Like being the hardware guy thats the one that excites me
That Mac Pro mmm mmmm
And you made a little Instagram video
It was like do you think their gonna show the Mac Pro?
I was like of course not
Well they did and it is absolutely fantastic
I am so excited to spec this thing out
because I feel itll probably be like
75000 like by the time you spec that thing out
Maybe even more because if you wanna get multiple monitors
I dont even know oh my gosh
Am I gonna be doing an unboxing of
a hundred thousand dollar Mac Pro?
Has everybody been talking about the Mac Pro?
Mac Pro modularity weve been asking for this
for ages and now we have a computer
which basically we can keep for lets say 5 6 7 8 years
without worry of having to throw away and buy a new one
But like that Mac Pro looked really dope right
And what I really appreciate is that they actually
gone sort of above and beyond
to make sure this is super modulate
So its not one of those things where oh you have to buy
like the Apple adding parts all the time
Or anything like that
Obviously the offer though is a nice sort of
as a feature to have but you could
also just buy your own graphics card and throw it in
As long as you have the drivers it should work
And so I was able to take a look on the inside
The cooling seems to be solid
its got a huge power supply but
importantly you just got a bunch of PCI slots right
Put whatever you want in there
And it even seems like that zion
even though I wasnt able to actually take off heat sinc
is also fairly user upgradable
So its one of those things where its like
imagine if Apple makes a super high end desk top
with all the features of a super high end desk top
and the price of a super high end desk top
Oh my gosh theres so much stuff
like just where do we even watch OS
I mean the IOS oh gosh Im just new maps
The new maps looked actually amazing
Oh and also Siri she has new voice
The photo and video editing on IOS 13
was really cool because I feel like for me
that will replace that extra step that I do
in visco for videos at least like
Instagram videos you know like editing on there
but straight on the camera app is really cool
Think that Ive been looking forward to the most
of course is dark mode
Im a simple man I just want to save my battery life
Actually I lied my first highlight
is gonna be dark mode IOS
Thats what we wanted I feel like weve been
wanting this for the longest time and its finally here
Dark mode hello?
The dark mode like we were expecting
that more to come and its happened
Also the new watch faces of course and the new maps
So like a few things
Well obviously dark mode like its a favorite
I was waiting for it for the longest time so
I use dark mode on twitter on my Mac Book
on everything so definitely dark mode
Yo dude this is actually there was a lot of
stuff here right so its cool to see like
watch OS updates Im actually like
lowkey excited to see all the iPad stuff
Like for me the iPad Pro is so close to being a machine
which can really be like a good for almost everything
besides editing sort of thing
Like its super lightweight I love the software
I love the hardware its just nice
its actually getting some more Pro features
So Im a big fan of the iPad Pro last year
And thats really like the tablet getting
closer to the laptop and you know
Apple has tried to keep those two worlds separate
but were seeing over the last two years
Mac OS and IOS kind of merge the two worlds together
and that new iPad OS is probably a step in the
right direction Im pretty excited as an iPad Pro user
because thats really going to increase my productivity
and be able to use that tool to do more things
Oh Side Car?
The iPad is a second display and also
you can use it as a tablet which is amazing
because I love using tablets
Obviously the Mac Pro is the
one were all excited about
That stand and that monitor got my attention
The 5000 monitor with an extra 1000 stand
I dont know if a lot of people caught that
and then theres another 1000 for the matte finish
So thats an exciting display but its very pricey
But its for the pros so well see how that goes
And then theres a ton of features in Mac OS
in watch OS in IOS in iPad OS
Its all good stuff
Theres so much stuff I dont even know
This made no sense
And there we go guys highlights from
DubDub its been absolutely awesome so much stuff
For me personally dark mode something that I was
definitely looking forward to you
guys have hear me say dark mode all things
so its great that we now have that
And also sidecar being able to use your iPad Pro
with the Apple pencil that should be really cool
I know somebody who uses that Wacom bamboo tablet
so it will be nice to be able to experience that
And Mac Pro I mean that thing is a beast
I know theres going to be a lot of cheese grater jokes
but how powerful it is is pretty crazy
And thats it for this video

Friends May be you all are enjoying free data
but in todays date you may have fgvhv
if you see free of charge is no more free
and  in such a case that if you are in a rural area
and if you dont have sufficient internet speed
then probably you might not be able to see this video properly
for that YouTube has developed a new superb app for India which is called as
YouTube Go
and today I am going to talk with you about that
because here we say
Maje Udao Data Nhi
Hello Friends  My name is Gaurav
and you are watching Technical Guruji
So Lets Begin
Friends I had already made another video on YouTube Go somedays before
but that time it was only announced
But now it is available in play store in the BETA format
and more updates are comming soon
so lets see how much awesome youtube go is
and whether it will let you download videos on slow net speed
and though this you can share the videos too
now let see youtube go
this is youtube go application on play store
download are still little because it is released recently
and if you read it benefits and details by going into its Readmore option
and here you will it is a normal application
which works like youtube
but here you will have many data benefits and the size of the app is low
instead of that you can control data share videos after downloading
and this app is going to be fast and will work on old phones too
so here are many benefits of youtube go
and if you need I will give the link to this app in the description
so from there you can install this app
after installing this you will be asked to verify your mobile no which is linked to your google account
doing all this and you will get the app home screen
here you will get videos depending on your search history or standard trending videos
and here you will get another tab for saved videos
where you can see your saved video collection
and if you want you can send or receive them too  which is the most important feature of this app
and you also get some basic setting where you can change your language kinds of stuff
you will get this basic layout where you can search videos
and if you click them you will see the preview of the where you can see
what content is inside that video because this happens often mostly
where video content other than video title and your data get wasted
so here you will not let your data get wasted and
you also get some options for video quality
a basic quality which will be around 144p  and
and a standard one having like 360p
you will also see the size of video according to the quality for letting you play or save
for a sample I will save this video on basic quality
I clicked on save
here the video is saving
and after completion it came in my saved videos
now let I want to share this with my friends
you can do it too if you and your friends use YouTube go app
although you may not get the option for subscription likedislike you cant comment in this app
but even at least you can see the youtube in less data
so if I want to send
which video I want to send  I will click on this video to send
then it will try to make a local wifi hotspot  clicked on allow once
It will make wifi and scan nearby
and now at that time I have to pick the other phone where you want to get video
and click on receive video
after that they will make the connection and will show the name
when clicked it will show confirmation message on the phone wether you want to send it or not
afterward the video will be transferred between the phones in less instance of time
and after receiving video you can see the same video
it is an excellent option by the way

Hey friends today I have an awesome video
So today I havewhoo
Jio phone so today lets unbox it
lets see what are the box contents
How is this phoneHow can you use it
and with this phone whatever you can do
if you buy this phone for 1500 for this JIO Phone
So hey guysmy name is Gaurav Chaudhary You are watching Technical Guruji
so lets get started
So guys this is the colorful box of the JIO Phone
and here you have peshwa bajirao
which tells you that you can enjoy movies
and TV on this phone
And here you get info about the Jio Cable
with which you can connect jio phone to your Television
here you have some technical specifications
Here you have highlights about jio services in this phone
You can see moviesTV get music in this little phone
when you open the box you can see the black jio phone
let us put it asideyou get some more accesories
you have some guidesyou have a charger
with micro usb connector
with an output rate  of 5v and 700 mili amperes
we also have a big 2000 mAH battery
It is big because it gives your phone a lot of capacity
and you only have this muchwhat else can you expect from a 1500rs phone
getting a phone is a great thing
so lets boot the phone
first we have to insert the sim card
and then we will insert the battery
and along with the sim you can also insert a memory card upto 128 GB
So we will talk about the phones physical overview while the phone is booting
you get a 24 inch QVGS screen
there is not gorilla glass but
by the weight you can say that the durability
can also be compared with an Iphone
down you get a 1234567890 keypad
on the upper side of the phone you get a torchlight
on the back side you have a 2 megapixel camera along with a loud speaker
on the front side you have a 03 megapixel camera
below you get a micro usb connector
with a 35 mm audio jack
as I told you you can remove the back of the phone too
and thats it for the physical overview
when you boot the phone
it is written powered by Kai OS
it is a different type of OS based on
here you will get a feeling
of android at some heights
if you go to settings and all
because even if this phone is cheap as 1500
you get very good options
first of all you get many apps
Jio apps Jio TVJio cinemaJio musicmy Jio etc
and you get the basic apps
which all the other phones have
EG Calculator
wireless radio and unit converter
obviously calls and messaging
you also get some shortcuts
if you try pressing the Dpad
leftrightup and down
you can get into different apps
in setting you also get support for
wifibluetoothNFC and GPS
only thing that is not there is wifi hotspot
we hope well get it in the next updates
you also get Jio money in this phone
you can also make video calls through this phone
you also get option for SOS
if you hold the no5 button for a while
you can give a message to your favorite contacts
in fact you can also send your jio location
there are many things in this phone
there are many apps too
In fact
you can also browse websites
but it would be better if I dont talk much in this video
it would be much better if you use this phone yourself and
you explore your jio phone
my opinions
we all know that no one provides these features at this value
and these 1500rs
will get back to you when you
return the phone to Jio after 3 years
but the main problem is
about the availability because the demand is very much
so if you havent booked it yet then book it right now
I think that this phone can turn the people of India
on your side of Internet
who played the snake game in Nokia 1100
but because of jio phones live tv movies
the can connect
to internet
so this is an awesome option
but no use for me
because there is no Jio network in Dubai
so one of you viewers is gonna get
you just have to comment what did you like about this phone
you also have to like and shower your love
and also share this video
and subscribe the channel if you want to show your love and also press the bell
if you wont no problem but if you will then Ill feel good
thats all for the video
I hope you liked the video
if you have any questions or suggestions about the jio phone
if you havent liked or shared then also like and share
and dont forget to subscribe the channel because

to a risk cracker
okay okay so if anybody is in North
America you know you try to read thats
what this tastes like
I think this is getting boring because
you know these guys are just eating

lets go for its challenge rather than
just giving an unboxing so how about you
some interesting stuffs like you never
heard of what is here from India you
know about aloe vera most of the guys

that Im not trusting you on that look
at it Im not what does that look like
show the audience was you didnt to
pronounce this thing okay
this is gold yeah yeah good luck Shinhwa
shower brush join the Shaolin brush
Okay so one thing is that we havent done anything like this till now right?
I mean weve not gotten together
The collective influence of everybody on this table is crazy right?
Thats absolutely right
I mean this kind of influence
Gaurav bhai?
I mean one thing is that were talking about the round table but we havent got the whole
round done
We havent got the whole round done
Its half round
Yeah its half round
We kept the camera
We needed a place for the camera
So the thing is that this discussion is very important
not just for today but also for tomorrow
Whats going to happen tomorrow?
What is the future of technology?
And obviously you guys are also here
Well talk about the creator life
Well talk about everything
So I just want to put Ill put a bomb first
Why havent we done this till now?
Like what Like why havent we gotten together till
And why did it take us so long?
Because people have a perspective right?
That outside Is the tech community not together?
Is it like that?
Or not?
Efforts take a lot of time to gather everyone
That becomes a very difficult part
You guys have sent us such a big invite
So how can we not come?
I cant do that
No its all about taking one initiative
Like you guys took it
So So I want to chime in here
So I want to chime in here
So we apply for awards at TrakinTech
So even with this much value addition I didnt think Because we can tell from a normal
video that about which phones we liked
So we thought what is it that will you know you know really bring value
And I think that was the reason he said nahi karna hi
hai kitna bhi effort jaane do
And I think Aishat pulled it off
Nahi meko controversial answer chahiye tha
Yeh toh bahut hi diplomatic ho gaya hai
So Ill give you the controversial answer
I think yeh bahut hi hum log shuru kar rahe hain with everybody loves everybody
And you know yeh bahut accha
I dont think thats the real answer
I agree with you
Effort hai
Initiative liya kisi ne
But I also think that there is this thing in this community that why is it that we
dont have enough collaborations?
I mean why is it that in most videos were not doing things together?
It is because this is a overall community jahaan pe each of us is very cocooned in our
Hamara Instagram hamara YouTube hamara channel our personality our identity
Theres not enough
How many times have the three four of us collaborated?
Uska reason yeh hai na?
Ki matlab okay pehli baat toh locations koi Pune waitha hai
Koi Chile bhi waitha hai
Bihar wala menlo sab ek saath hote hain
Kaunsi collaboration?
Aap hamishchah camera leke aate toh ho?
Ki aaj aapko karte hain ki
Main toh allinclusive bhi hai
But Im just saying that if push comes to shove aur hum log ne if this whole topic
and this roundtable is all about being very very honest
I think Im not saying that there is any controversy to it
but I think hum log sab bahut inclusive hai within our own little cocoon of what we do
hum log zyada collaborative nahi hai abhi
And I think this could be the start of it all
Toh reason kya hai?
Kya hai reason?
I want to ask Devinder
Because he comes from that
I also agree
I also agree with Rajiv ki I feel ki tech community na
thodi si it is a competitive space
Actually aisa nahi hai ki
Matlab wo setup hi aisa hai
Ki jaise agar phone ka review jaata hai toh theres like three reviews going at the same
Toh essentially everybody is competing with each other
Everybody will see everyones videos right?
Lekin ek baat bolo mujhe dusri industry mein aisa nahi hota hai
Every industry is competing
Hota hai but I think in the tech community specially
India Asia right?
Where we basically
I think hum log ka competition zyada hai
I think we
The social media part of it is that we are more with I have
to be out first I have to have the product first
Hum log ki ego hurt ho jaati hain agar humare koi product nahi bol raha hai
Agar hum globally baat karte hain
Haan haan hundred percent
Ego hai baat
Hundred percent
I mean isme na
I think its possible
I agree with that
Agar Shlok ne ego bola hai toh at least itna toh hum agree karte hain ki Shlok ko toh hai
Main kehta hoon mere ko bhi hai
I am immediately agreeing you know everybody else can be as diplomatic
Ego doesnt have to be a negative thing
Yeah exactly
Theres no negative to it
For growth you have to respect yourself and you have to have ego that actually fuels your
Jo aage leke jaate hain isme kya galat hai?
But at the same time I would also
I would also add one thing ki I personally have a huge
amount of respect for everybody sitting here
Kyunki Gaurav has been working so hard and it has inspired him
It has inspired me
And how Arun sir and Rajeev sir have been helping me
I think it is very personal for me
And it is a very emotional thing for me
But also at the same time I think matlab yeh competitive space hai
And for that muskil bhi hota hai
Hum baat karne hai India mein aisa kyu nahi ki hai humne aaj
For that matter bahar bhi kisne kya kiya hai?
Agar hum aisa bol rahe hain ki hum sab competitive hai toh same goal for
I think waha pe thoda
But more or less same goal for the US guys yaar
Nahi but I agree with Gaurav
You know something we dont know Gaurav?
US guys ke baare mein?
Im just saying
Toh basically kya hai ki abhi tak nahi ho paya ab ho gaya
Acha okay
Just asking you personally
Yeh achieve karne mein kya kisi ko bhi chase karne mein
aisa laga ki koi off chal raha hai?
Nahi na?
All you had to do was just one call?
And just one message?
Surprisingly smooth ha?
Surprisingly smooth
Simple reason main aapko batata
December ke mahine mein humare paas content nahi hota
Yeh reality hai
Sachme hum log struggle karte hain
Sancheet iska matlab yeh keh raha hai ki agar maine phone karke bola hota
March April mein ya phir Diwali ke pehle sabse peak season mein tu nahi aata tha?
Nahi nahi
Main toh aata 100 Gaurav nahi hota
Gaurav nahi hota
I think unka matlab scheduling problem hai
Not a matter of main nahi aata kyunki
But hum sabki dates collide karte hai
Aur infact jab tech ki baat karte hai aaye din tech aati
hai aur seriously hum logon ka peth bhara hai
Honestly content hi kameeth nahi padti nahi hai toh thoda aisa lagta hai ki yeh theek
hai kamaayi bhi ho rahi hai
Main honestly bata raho
Ki mujhe aisa lagta hai ki ho rahi hai kamaayi?
Nah merko ho rahi hai
Main samjha nahi kamaayi?
What do you mean?
Ajit toh kamaayi karta hai
I only want them to say something
Devinder and Tamil
So first of all yeh bahut badi cheez hai ki we have achieved something like this
that all of us can come together and speak freely
Toh yeh bahut hi badi cheez hai
And I appreciate the efforts that you guys have put in
Pehle kyun nahi hua?
Iske multiple reasons hai
Its very evident that the tech community all of like
Im not saying ki hum log but bahut saare aisa content creators hain that they dont
get along very well
And that is the reason it creates a tension between all of us
Toh wo bhi rahta hai
Competition as you said is another thing
For us specifically language is also thoda sa barrier ban jata hai ki hum ek audience
ko address karte hain
Look at your Hindi man
Main toh shock hoye ja rahe hoon
Main dar gaya hoon yaar
This is fantastic
Main Rajasthan se hoon toh Hindi toh
Au phir toh phir
Ragh ragh mein hain
Toh ab humein yeh bhi lagta hai kahi baar jab hum collaborate karne jaate hain ki humari
audience bahut
saare audience South India se hai
So they might not understand if we change the language all together or if we try to
collaborate with a different content creator whos creating similar content
but in a different language
So that becomes a barrier sometimes
Aur aisa nahi hai ki humne collaborate nahi kiya hai
We have collaborated multiple times but this sort of collaboration hasnt happened
But this is something big
Tamil what about South?
Matlab and you guys represent Shaz and Tamil represent
You forgetting your own person?
Hes tracking Tamil
What is this?
What is this Arun?
Okay Arshad
Office mein baat karte hain iske baat karte hain
Nahi nahi mujhe bolo yeh South India mein yaar Tamil tech creators mein aise hi hain
yaar situation is different
Even we collaborated before itself
I came to your studio I collaborated for a video
Gaurav ke saath ek video kiya tha maine Sherlock se mil nahi paya so unse hi nahi
kiya tha maine
Jab maine try kiya tha har baar try karta hua main
No not you Im saying generally jaise hum baat kar
rahe the humare ecosystem kya ho rahe the South India tech people
Nahi usme yeh hi dikkat hai because most of the time kya hota hai na sabko beech
mein competition hi hai
Pehli cheez most of the things happen only in North India
Device jab South India ko aana hai vohi mushkil tha
pehli aap thoda thoda aaja tha
That is the main fact
So getting the device Is it only devices or something else beyond
Whatever it is the recognition recognition only recent past maybe the last three years
we used to get lot of recognition and the whole India is getting online plugin
Scale to Scale now we are getting but before if you
come even now people think me that Im from Chennai
Even if youre not in Chennai we can do the content
Thats how it is
We are in Pune
No no no
For South if Im from Tamil Nadu Im not from Chennai
And previously what used to happen is
Phone Erna or C4 Tech they used to be in Chennai
And the devices jo bhi aa raha hai sirf un log ko hi milega
So mere ko kya milega?
Kuch bhi nahi milega
Us time pe me Gaurav jab inne Dubai se video jab kar raha tha we can talk hell lot of
things about technology even without the device
Thats what I got to learn from watching these videos
Then I started doing those
Thats the biggest thing for me Again you have not answered my question
Your enmity you tell me Enmity competitiveness our Hindi
No no I do understand See I follow each and everyone
Literally everyone Ive subscribed to them I started my channel looking at your inspiration
and everything But the problem is that the regional
You need some kind of a difference when youre doing videos For me its like I create some
characters like Different companies as a character
Then you know thats how I picked up my channel But
again his question is not getting answered You guys are talking about you Is there better
camaraderie between all of you?
I dont know what I can direct you No not with all let me be frank
Im putting that out there
Not with all lets just get an answer Recently what happened?
I had a conversation with few of the creators earlier
So with the new kind of creators coming in And new guys are getting the views and everything
There is a chance Either you have to collaborate with them
Or youre just be on your own So which one you have to choose?
So what do you choose?
I just be on my own So this is what Im trying to say
That is the main thing The tech community is first choice
be on your own Im very glad youve done this
Even though youre saying it was very smooth and everything else
I still do believe that the amount of effort That has put into get this together Hats off
I dont think very many of us would have taken this on
Its a very difficult task Because while people saying yes
Is only one very small part of putting it all together
And I would really really hope that after this
The collaborations and that sort of cocooning Where we all go into our own little box breaks
So we keep using the word out of the box in tech Lets also do out of
the box content with each other
Not be But Ill answer your question which is like
Is there some kind of a clash?
Yes there is There is
Okay Okay Thats done Now coming to both of you
Here also right now youve said that you know We should work together and going forward
Still that competitiveness is going to be there
Still there is going to be that Who gets the first device?
Who gets the first video?
Why didnt I get it?
I saw the video No matter how much you do
I mean even with everyone If I didnt get the device and Gaurav got
it Then Ill call and ask
Why didnt I get the device that Gaurav got?
This is what we It happens
It happens right?
No it doesnt That is Shlok
Yes 100 Okay so I think
If there is competition If you look at it in a healthy way
Then it should be there
And there is nothing wrong with it At the same time We all know that we all coexist
Yes Its a fact And we dont want to hurt anyone
If I have to make a video with Shlok Then I know for sure
If I say anything He wont say no
I know And I think like I said
When he called When we spoke
Gaurav you are talking about inclusiveness We are talking about
What the point he has brought is Okay now let me ask you You will see that Shlok got
a device And you didnt get it
Call him We will do it together
Listen Ill give you an example Samsung Galaxy Note 8 or Note 9
I forgot the exact device I think Note 8
In which was the yellow SPen of golden color It was a blue phone with a yellow SPen Note
8 Note 8
Note 8 Note 8
Samsung launched in New York Okay I went to New York for Global Impact
I remember two people with me From YouTube side
I dont know about the other media people Ranjeet and Bharat
From IGN We three went
Now I was part of the Samsung Global Program and all So I got the phone with full box and
everything In New York
For the video Before launch I got the handson system
And because I was a part of the Samsung Global Team After that I went to Korea and all that
happened Ranjeet and Bharat didnt have that access
to the device Now I didnt talk to Bharat at that time
I was aware I mean I knew him
But we never talked I used to talk to Ranjeet
So Ranjeet got the device And just the device
No box nothing And that too for a limited duration Just for
12 hours Do whatever you want to do handson
I still remember There was a place here
There is a walk in New York
Which is built on a railway track Okay okay
Yeah It was just opposite the Samsung office I still remember the exact same thing I saw
Ranjeets face And he was like
What should I say now Just a phone
And I have a box So basically you wanted to make a video
So what did I do I told Ranjeet
I said do one thing Who knows that I have unboxed the same box
I said what happens in the box Thats the cable charger
I said I will make a video You keep the phone
You unbox it again And I did that
Excellent And here we have a very fine example Nothing phone
Yeah We had a similar thing When I asked for help Everybody has been ready to help
And this is with everyone And I keep asking And I didnt get the nothing phone personally
I dont know if it was a challenge Or I missed it
But I asked Arun for the phone
And he also I mean
He was getting a loss In giving the phone
If I am honest I think
Look Shlok honestly Sharing a device today
For that matter If we talk
Its not like Lets say I only have access
Or you only have access And they will have it
If not today it will happen tomorrow So the main point is If you say no lets say
Does not End the world for that person
You will get the access Why not put together
I want to ask a question There is a brand discrimination here Like
Is there a level playing field For everyone
There are small creators At what level is that
And here is At your level you are talking about this
Imagine a smaller level
I am proud to say This is a very good conversation
Because this is more or less A congregation of the top creators
Top creators This is a little
Lets bring it down to the reality No no no
We were not there before When You know 34 years back 5 years back
We were small At that time Gaurav was big
We did not have it And we know that situation
But was there a struggle or not It was a struggle
Thats what he is talking about Is there a level playing field today
We are talking about There cant be a level playing field
Level playing Ranjeet Trophy player
Will not get selected in the IPL He will have to work hard
We can do examples of cricket and everything else There is always going to be
Someone that is going to be Now moving forward
At one time you were not as big You were not as big
There was a struggle period Today a brand Knowing that it is the biggest creator Has
created a level playing field For them
But is there a divide As he said devices are available in North
India Not in South Are all these things still relevant
I think this is an important one Because this is going to be watched by all
brands Could we make life a little bit better for everybody By bringing forward some of
the challenges In this sense
What is a level playing field Numbers for brands
I am talking from brand perspective Now there are about 10 YouTubers
Who are more than 5 million subscribers They should go
Now level playing field Still does not happen that 8 out of 10 people
go Why?
Because brands Also have their biases towards certain things
Its not even bias I will say if its my company
I have this water bottle
I will give it to whoever I want This is what I am also trying to say out here
I completely agree As a brand it is completely their choice
Brand is not out there To create a level playing field in the content
But why did nothing discriminate To the South entirely
Very important question to ask Lets not get too specific
It cant be NorthSouth But it happens
It happens a lot I think
He made a point also North India has more access
Delhi has more access Like you said
Lets not go into a specific incident But its not one specific incident
I have heard about it many times There is a stage 1 and a stage 2
For everything to be sent out And eventually
The reality of the business that we are in Which is content creation
Where views matter Who watches your video matters Are you not interested in the number
of views
When your video goes out after 1 hour After 12 hours You do look at it
You dont ignore it If you are going to get a device
About 2 weeks after If you are going to send out All their unboxing
and reviews How do you expect everybody else To get the same number of views I think there
is that It is understandable But it is a brand prerogative
First access that is the reason why Because the one who will post it later
Is not going to get it Is our space all about first access Let me
be very very clear It is all about views
But sir first access brings views I bought the device earlier
I dont even get devices from the company I buy it from the market
We have done it too Thats what I do
What I like about what he is saying Is that
Uniqueness There is a uniqueness in the content That also brings the views
I know many people globally Who still buy devices
And their videos are fantastic Views can be 5000 4000 10000
But still The production quality and the interest
Is clearly visible And he is buying the device
Ill give you my own example
You must be assuming that I get side devices
I shop for 810 lakhs every month just to buy devices
And I think we all have it
We are not talking about shoes and clothes
Im not talking about that
So this thing I mean somewhere
But you bought the iPhone
Bro leave this
I dont think anybody will think about that
Ill give you my example
Even today lets say there is a brand which is not operating in India
Or if it is then I dont have access to it
Ill buy it
Hoping that one day we will have connects
We dont have it today
And I think all of us have done that stage before
But we cant do it for each and every device that is launching
Thats where the problem comes
Its about the level then
Today when I started YouTube
When all of us started this journey
We all started at one level
In the beginning we talked only about devices
Then we went to events
Then we get devices
So there is always a level 1 2 3
I will agree with him completely
Because even this IBTR for that example
We have taken this risk
Because getting all this together putting all that effort
We dont know whether we are going to get views
But we have to do it
You have to take that risk
Like you said we cant buy all the devices
No you have to
And if it works good
If it doesnt it is a risk
Same I would say for me also
Because when I started
When I was making videos
Everybody was popular
I think for 35 years
I made videos without any phone
And I didnt have money to buy a phone
So what I used to do was
If a phone launched I would make a video without the phone
Thats it
This phone came out
These are my opinions
Thats how we started
At that time opinion videos were also very popular
My first video that went more than 10000
Was OnePlus 5
Where I made an opinion video
And thats how it started
But that was the first video
And at that time it was very popular
I started from Dubai
There was no access there
And I did those
So you know what
I want to segue into that
I want to ask a question
If a new creator wants to start today
You can make opinion videos
If I dont get devices today
Today is the time where
Unboxing videos
Are on their way out
There is nothing on the box
You actually take a look at it
I think the most boring thing now for an audience
Is unboxing
Its boring for us also
I dont disagree
Unboxing is fun
Opening the box is very exciting
Shlok is your unboxing
It is the most exciting thing
Unboxing today
Forget about the phone
If you unbox anything
It will get you all the eyeballs
But I am saying
Unboxing today is the same as it used to be
We used to do it earlier
Its exactly the same
I have seen them do this
I have seen Arun do this
The kind of excitement that they bring to the videos
Is crazy
But I am saying that we are now reaching that stage
Where the audience
May not be sharing the same excitement
I will tell you why
When I agreed with you
Unboxing as a process
Why is unboxing fun?
What Shlok says
It is
Every time you open a box
There is something new
Something different
The emotional connect
That is not important
The excitement of seeing a new thing
A new phone
A new design
Unboxing a car
That mystery
I will give you a great insight
About all our videos
I will tell you who watches our unboxing videos
Lets say you unbox a new iPhone
I am someone
Who wants to buy the iPhone
And I have ordered it
Its showing me delivery in 2 days
For 2 days
I will watch 510 unboxings of iPhones
I know they are going to be the same
I have done this
Its my emotional thing
I will watch Sanchits
I have to buy the Steam Deck OLED
I have been looking at every single day
When it shows me its out for delivery
I will still watch those videos
For that excitement
I will go one step ahead
Once I buy a phone
Even after that
I am watching on my Vivo
I am watching on that phone itself
Its an emotional thing
I will tell you the part
That I think has changed
When unboxing as a concept came
At that time
For the viewer
For us
For everybody else
There was a lot of mystery
And unboxing was magic
Because no one
Including you when you got the box
You didnt know what is going to come out
The way marketing is today
With all brands
How much of it is still a surprise to you
Almost 90 of the reveal
Has already happened also for you
And for your audience
Then why are people watching millions of videos
India has a population
It wont be exciting for us
100 Initially
We put a camera over the head
Opened the box
We evolved
We changed the camera
We added expression
Unboxing has evolved to a completely different level
Only the smell of the box
And everything else
And then you just close on the fact
That you are just opening a box
And you are describing
This is a good box
It has an emotional feel
While it is fantastic
The marketing
If you look at the brand strategy today
Their marketing
That is based on a reveal
Of 90 of everything
Because they are trying to make sure
Let me just finish this
A brand today
Is trying to make sure
That their product
Is coming after 2 months
Somebody is not making a purchase decision
They want you to wait 2 months later
For their product
And therefore they want to start revealing
A lot more
Even for brands
That used to be very secretive about everything
Whether it is done conspicuously
Behind the scene
Under the table
Everything gets revealed
In short he is saying
2 years ago
It is not that
It is Shlok
Doing the unboxing
Shlok speaking
Arun speaking
Arun dropping the phone
Gaurav doing
There are channels on YouTube
They dont say anything
There is no face
Getting millions of views
You have to understand
It is the only claim
Dal rice can never be boring
It is a point
Yesterday we were shooting a product
And we were taking a lot of shots
We had to peel off a lot of places
My team is telling me
People love to see this shot
Peel off and all this should happen
Whether it is significant or not
Because that attracts a lot of audience
And the connection
Which can relate
That adds a lot of value to the video
But BBomb doesnt do unboxing
When you are testing a new product
Peel off
You guys have cracked the Instagram code
Kitchen appliances
Teach us
Like we were talking
We get a lot of products
Because we get a lot of products first hand
You get it or you buy it
I am coming to that
The products we cover
90 of the products are bought by us
So we are spending a lot of money
A lot of research that goes behind it
A lot of your products are from abroad
Do you guys do that?
Unique items
There was a Lyric speaker
I think it was 152 lakhs
We had to purchase it
There was a Nike selflacing shoes
That we bought for 55000
It takes 12 months for them to arrive
So do you reach out to the companies
Or you just buy it?
Reach out is a lengthy tedious process
So we buy it
Its a tedious process
Its a long process
It means there is a lot of money behind it
To buy that
When he looks at that product
He knows that when I make a video on it
It will get a lot of views
Its a business
Its an investment
Into the future
The question that you had
Sorry carry on
When we started building Instagram
We have very clear intentions
That Instagram is a different platform
YouTube is a different platform
So we treat them very separately
Yes we make content
On both the platforms
Like there is one product
The content will go on both the platforms
But they will be done in their own separate ways
There is no crossposting
Sometimes they use two different videos
Rupesh is for YouTube
And Akshay is there for Instagram
So the idea is when we started building Instagram
We made sure that we are going to invest
This much amount of money
In building this
And in that strategy we were clear
That we will not accept any paid campaign
So that was our strategy for the first one and a half years
Jab tak hum 1 million hit nahi karenge uske baad yes obviously but abhi bhi agar aap
dekhoge toh frequency bahut kam hai because our approach is audience first
Agar audience ko hum bahut zyada bombard karne lagenge paid content se so they might not
start liking it
So its always to add value to the audience
So Ishaan your question so coming back to it this is a great point your question was
very different from where this discussion went away
Your question was if a new person whos never done this before is just starting his
channel is unboxing the video and my answer was not for that person
No he did not ask about unboxing he said he just said
new creator only you put that unboxing thing
Im going round this thing one tip that you want to give
to a new creator starting with Rajiv
I think Im going to go with exactly what he said because that is really my entire
spirit and philosophy jo maine
pehle din bhi shuru kiya tha when I started what was not happening anywhere in the world
which is a television show on tech right the
strategy remains the same the tip remains the same agar aap alag nahi kar sakte passion
ke saath nahi kar sakte and youre only going to follow someone elses success you are
100 going to be a failure
Find the passion and you have to be dramatically different
Inhone ek strategy banayi bahut clear strategy hai well
buy it well not take paid campaigns we have something where well do things very
very different
They understood the platform that Instagram is very different from YouTube
Understand what you are doing do not be a sheep or a herd ke uski shlok ki badi achi
unboxing hai he does this and he drops the phone ye ek weighing machine
rag dete hain ke achar iske itne gram hai Gaurav does this way of if
you are going to take bits and pieces and segments from all the
others and you want to then create your own personality youre going to
be a split personality with nothing happening
The strategy cannot be different today content will always be king queen prince ace everything
its not going to change the strategy must be that
Gaurav aapta hai?
Yaar mujhe lagta hai internet is a youth stage aur sab
ke liye audience hai saamne wo aaj nahi hai ho sakte hai ek saal baad aayegi hum on
a beginner level to be honest main bolta hoon kisi ko bhi dont invest ek x amount
kyuki wo return karne ke chakar main dimaag mein rehega na
ki main ne itna paisa lagaya main ko chahiye chahiye chahiye dont do that
Log camera kharitte hain team lete hain kuch dharwat nahi hai aaj ki date mein all
you need is your phone
You did it alone for so long
Mainne shuru ki 100 video apne phone mein banaya thi woh front camera se why front
camera because rear mein uska preview dikhega nahi to selfie se banaya hai main anyway
Aaj ki date mein you just need to start aur platforms
like Instagram YouTube short video bahut zyada rewarding hai and it all kind of you
know requires just you being consistent
Aapko 100 din tak target kar lo main 100 din tak 100
videos har roz post karunga usme se 10 video definitely
viral jayenge hi jayenge and you dont need anything
aapko box nahi chahiye phone nahi chahiye kuch nahi chahiye you just want to talk
to people just talk about anything kuch bhi topic hai
aapko baat karni hai thats all
You know this is beautiful it just ties up with what I
wanted to say patience because I have been the most patient person when it
comes to channels
You know when I started Trakin Tech first 1 year we went only from 0 to 3000 subscribers
in 1 year when I was
posting me and Prateek were posting 1 video every day matlab nearly
August 2016 se leke May end 2017 tak 1011 mahine continuously daal de hai aur humare
3000 subscribers ho gaye kabhi bhi ek video 10000 ke upar nahi gaye but I knew someday
we are going to crack it and then 1 video jo 1 plus 5 ka hai I still
remember that wo gaya and then we just took off
So my thing is unique raho aap consistent raho har roj
video daalna hai ya hapte mein ek daalna hai ya mahine
mein ek daalna hai jo bhi decide kiya hua hai wo karo consistently and be patient
results will appear
Ill give a very fine example we had started another
shorts channel Wittipedia naam ka entertainment pe you know we had given them 6 months
even after me knowing me being mujhe pata hai ki itne saare channels hai
ki nahi hoga mein bola 6 mahine hum log karenge agar nahi
hota hai toh we are going to dismantle we are not going to put much
Every day hum daal rahe hain uske upar videos 6 mahine ke baad it was what hardly 2000
ya 3000 subscribers ho gaye we dismantled the team 2 mahine chale gaye because host
wo gaye rahe liye the bahar se 2 mahine ke baad suddenly
1 short went that in that 15 days ek short viral jaane ke baad
we went 400k subscribers in 400k 4 lakh subscribers in 15 days aur
mere paas abhi team nahi hai toh Anson ko wapas bola nahi wo log chale gaye
toh main wohi
bol raha hoon so patience
Look I feel I agree saari cheezon ke saath I think consistency zaruri hai I think saari
cheezon hai but mere khayal se ek cheez jo ek creator ko successful manauti hai wo
hai ki jo maine ghari hai merle work ghari hai
ke bhai main apni audience se kabhi jhoot nahi bolta main jaisa jo
cheezein hain hoon and ya light aayi hai aur coffee aagayi
hai toh aapke aachanak se continuity continuity
continuity there was a power cut humare bottle ke colour
bhi change ho gaye green to blue so okay go ahead
But ek cheez maine notice kari di ki jab sab bata rahe
the kisi ne algorithm ki tags title aise dalna
thumbnail aise lagana hai kisi ne koi baat nahi kari and
I think I also agree ki ek doi bande ek jo person video banara hai ek jo person video
dekh raha hai agar aap us audience se dil se connect kar sakto aur usko kuch valuable
de sakto toh aap video chalegi aaj nahi toh kahl nahi toh parson ek saal lakh sakta
do saal lakh sakta kabhi na kabhi toh chalegi aur main bhi starting mein
mera bhi bhi tha ki main callin mein baata tha na paise the kuch bhi nahi tha mobile
se hi maine bhi video banayi thi jaise hum sabne start kara tha and tutorial banara
tha main toh mobile mein yeh aise karlo software mein yeh karlo thod tej
rahega aise ek saal banaya and woh dheere dheere pehle
10102020100100 views aan lagaye toh fir bad gaye toh mera bahut simple hai ki
agar main kuch audience se dil se connect karke kuch de paa raha hoon and main honest
hoon toh grow hoonga and maine jitte bhi YouTubers ko dekha jo
kuch actual acha kar rahe hain woh apni audience se bhauti zyada connected hai toh mere ke
aata hai woh sabse aad important hai toh tu aise kahe raha hai ki thumbnails aur titles
important nahi hai nahi
but woh change hote rahata hai na woh constant nahi hai toh titles are very YouTube specific
thing why do I feel like everything that I agree its a very
YouTube content creation could be Instagram but content creation I agree completely I
was just saying it is like saying ki yaar app
banane ke liye wali exercise karlo are khaan acha khao exercise
karlo apna ban jate hain kya baat se kuch sauce nahi all
right haan matlab mujhe aise lagta hai ki isme ek knowledge dene se better hai
toh ek raw thought share karta hu jab bhi hum audience ki baat karte hain hum bol jate
hain woh insaan hi hai jaise ki agar hum ek apne apartment me rahte
hain society ki baat karte hain toh mujhe aise lagta hai ki jo insaan baate achchi
karte hain na impact full baate karte hain ya
phir logon ke hit me baate karte hain woh hamisha achcha maana jata hai kisi bhi society
me toh ye thought maine apne aapme built in kiya abhi jab recently meri video nahi
chal rahi thi jab maine thoda comeback
ka socha hai toh mujhe tha yaar toh achchi baatein hoti hain na woh society mein kabhi
khatam nahi hoti aur society hi hume dekh rahi hai toh aur YouTube pe aap popular
kyun ho gaya apni baaton ki wajah se toh mujhe aise lagta hai ki maine bohot
kaam kiya apni speech ke upar bhi pauses kab lene chahiye impact kab dalna hota hai
toh jaise ki society ka example ek bohot acha rahata hai ki humein
log hi toh dekh rahe hain achchi baatein karoge 100 log dekhenge aur agar aapka
kisi cheez mein passion hai jaise mera tech mein mujhe
pata hai kisi bhi time baatein karalo uski baatein mein karunga
log sunenge toh mujhe se lagta hai ki yeh bohot basic cheez hai ki mere hisaap se baatein
achchi karne wale log jo hai chalte hai
You tell no?
Youre the creator
Dont be a moderator
Youre not a moderator
Im genuinely not moderating
None of us are talking till Ishaan doesnt
Yeh nahi ho raha hai
I dont have anything to tell people
Because Ill tell you mera toh main journalist tha yaar tech journalist mein usse yaha
main kya hoon?
But Im going to Im going to ask you
Ill keep quiet too
Both of us are similar
So then Ill keep quiet too
Listen har ek ka experience and I have a feeling that you and me have more to contribute
to this conversation kyunki hum log do platform se aarein
So tell me what do you think is the content creator that
jo aapka question tha answer it
I mean ek toh pehle define kar lo apne aapko ki content creator banna hai ki you know
you wanna do
So I think that journalism still has value mereko honestly waise lagta hai wo ek cheez
Doosra yeh ki I completely agree with the whole consistency bit
Because mereko toh usse because Ive seen that myself kyunki main toh abhi Im starting
Like for example you know Arun and I immediately had a conversation ki Tamil chalu karna hai
me bolein tikka chalu kar dete hain lets start it
And the only thing was consistent rao bas wo hi kiya aur kuch
Acha content kiya consistent rao like you said
Talk to the people
Thats the same I mean all of the answers just almost I have nothing new to add but
all of this is helping me in
building what I want to build right now
Bas utna bolunga
Wo maybe will help you also to build what you want to build
Aishwarya I want to ask and this will come as a surprise but do you think journalists
nowadays are overrated?
No not yeah yeah of course
But the best part about journalism is
Journalists right now is that they have platforms multiple platforms
I feel that in a lot of places it has happened that they
have also come on YouTube right?
Whether whatever beat they are covering now
Okay so if you have to say that YouTube creators the content creators on YouTube are on top
or the journalists are on top?
There is a reason why I am asking this
In which perspective are they on top?
Whats your perspective?
The perspective to look at is the societal perspective
Forget yours
What is the societal perspective?
Its looking fun right?
I want to see
Because you are a journalist you are a content creator now
And also we expect a diplomatic answer
No I am not going to become a diplomat not at all
See what is the problem of a journalist?
He studies from school right?
Then he is told who what how and when to follow
So maybe in that they are not connecting with the people that the content creators
Okay tell me one thing
See I have noticed it
Why do tech journalists hate YouTubers?
He is the one who made me do it
And I have got a very cold vibe from these people
Whenever I go to an event they give me such a cold vibe
I think he is laughing but I dont know why
Okay I will tell you
Lets do one thing lets finish this flow first
Then we will take the next question on this
Okay come on
The one thing is that dont do this for the moneys sake
Everybody wants to start a YouTube channel because they will get monetized
Thats what they all want to make
Okay I want to make some money out of it
No if you have genuine interest let it be tech or
If you think that you can put it out there in a very you know in a different and unique
And inconsistent
Then I think its a good option
If you are doing just for the money then I dont think
this is
Its not a job
But why is it not a job?
It shouldnt be one
Because its not that specific
Why is it not a career?
Why is it not a profession?
Its a career its not a job
I dont see any difference in those two
Its a career but not a job
People are only looking at the monetary thing
They are just forcing them
You should look at the monetary
I am not really understanding the its a career not a job
Dont do it for money
Money no matter what you do in life
It will come its a byproduct
Thats a given
Whats the problem with those people on YouTube?
Those who think that YouTube gives lots of money
And if they do it after thinking about it
Thats what I am saying
They will always be behind the mind always thinking about money
And at that time when they realize that they are not going to make money
Then they will be demotivated
And they will lose track
They should know that if you invest 23 years in it
There is a high chance that you will be successful
And money will follow
But if you think that he has earned this money
And I will also earn it
I will do it
There is no such formula
Thats what I wanted to convey
But thats for every business
Every job every profession
There is nothing different that we are saying
In YouTube the journey is not linear
In content creation its always exponential
Arun said that he has 3000 subscribers in 11 months
That was the path
And then
I just want to say something out here
Hold on to this exponential point
Because I am going to ask a question on this
Most of it is already covered
But two things that matter the most
Obviously you have to be consistent
And if someone is going to start today
I think short videos is the way to go
That gives you an entry barrier
Platforms reward
On YouTube you just have to play with the algorithm
You have to be consistent
You have to follow a schedule
That you always have to follow
And on Instagram you have to make content that is share worthy
That works
And second thing is you have to pick a niche
That comes to you naturally
Because all of us sitting here
We didnt choose tech
Because tech is the most lucrative
We chose it because we are desperate
We chose it because we are definitely interested in it
Naturally it came with us
Because of this I think these are the two points
If you fake it it will show
You have to have real passion for it
There was a question that was asked at one another
Can you fake it till you make it?
Not in the current content creation
It shows
People are too smart here
Not in any aspect
Any aspect
One tip
Almost all the points are covered
Second point is dont think
Just act
Most of the time we just keep on thinking
Whenever we
Stop this video now
Thats what usually happens
We overthink a lot
Because we see a lot of creators doing wonderful jobs
Covering most of the things which we dream of
Then we suddenly go
We dont have anything
What do we do?
Then we plan for something
Then suddenly we see the same thing
Which was done by some other people
Its not about doing the thing today or tomorrow
Its about just act
We have answered all the questions
On the topic of exponential growth
I want to pick that point
Do you consider yourself
Are you a celebrity?
Let me put it in a nicer way
How do you feel when some fan comes
Comes and talks to you
Takes pictures with you
What is the difference between your
Stardom and a celebrity stardom
That an actor or an actress has
Like a Bollywood actor or actress has
Its more of a brotherly connection
What happens in a celebrity
If theres a movie star
Its always a one way communication
The person will go watch the movie
And come back
Hes commenting
But he cant hear anything from the front
Its always one way
The content creators
And their followers
Its always a two way communication
Because we address them
Its somewhere happening
A two way communication
Second thing
The relatable vibe
Hes like us
He did this and that
And now he makes videos
The way people approach us
Its very comfortable
He wont get stuck
Hell come and talk to us
Its very simple
Its very friendly
Youre absolutely right
You know what happens
Ill tell you the reason
Everyday theyre watching us
We watch the news
What happens with movie stars
They watch one or two movies a year
Its very indifferent
But when they meet
And they literally faint
The die hard fans
These people
Tell us about the die hard fans
Best fan interaction
This is a long time back
One and a half year back
One guy literally came on the road
In one instance
He fell down from the bus
Because he had to walk
And second
One guy fainted
I was on the bike
And then he was like
And then he fainted
For just a minute
Day before yesterday
They could not even type the number on the phone
Phone doesnt unlock
Camera doesnt open
Ill tell you one with me
Which I thought was an incredible incident
In a public bathroom
I am there
That person is there
We are in the act
We are both
He is in the public bathroom
He turns around
He sees me
He just went completely nuts
He took the selfie then
Thank God at the right angle
If it was a typical selfie angle
That would have been a problem
I thought
He saw Rajeev
And he turned towards Rajeev
Shaz you wanted to say something
Like I said
The celebrity thing
They come and say
My phone is broken
What can I do?
Go to a service center
I think
This is a very interesting point
That we connect
We are not on top of a mantle
We are not on a big platform
It is not like that
It isnt like that
It is a good connection
I think most of the times
Besides a selfie or a conversation
I think most of the time
We are also asked for advice
Which phone which TV which laptop
Thats become part of our lives
And that is because what Arun said
We are there every day
Telling them the same things
They just come to us
And that video will continue with them
I think celebrities
If I were to look at it
From an audience standpoint
Have a higher status
Their job is to build perception
For example
I went to watch a cricket match
I bought an expensive ticket
But I was thinking
How many celebrities
Can buy a ticket
But they cant come to a normal stand
Because they have to build a perception
That yes we are on top
I think it is important to build
To watch A person
To watch You have
You have You have
You have Then you
Once a year
So I think the perception is that its inaccessible for a celebrity
So the scarcity there
increases the perception and aspiration
I think the exclusivity makes them the celebrity
Its the status
Celebrity obviously they are higher but
I was talking about
Not necessarily higher to be honest
Content creators are failing big celebrities
on your date
Thats very obvious
our video
has to open YouTube
a celebrity
to buy a ticket
to drive
to come to a hall
to sit in a crowd
become their dad
I wont take names but Ive had experiences
where Ive overshadowed people
Its a reality
Im not kidding
Who made celebrities?
And then people
Who is making us?
You talk about Bollywood politicians
people who are famous in multiple ways
as long as you are
top of the hill
In any field
its a similar experience
Ill tell you a small story
Like everyone was saying
celebrities are not approachable
They are YouTubers everyone agrees
Ill tell you a place
DC Chowk in Rohini
My car is parked there
And so many approachable people understand us obviously because we all share a
brotherly vibe
He came in the car
You are Sanchit
When he wanted to meet me he showed his hand
I wont tell you the cars experience
He gave me a good enough
five to six second pose
And I was like this at that time
What should I do?
And then he didnt take a selfie
He didnt take any selfie
He just called me white for a long time
And thats it
Ill tell you
I was like okay
Listen to my car experience
Its about Dubai
The three of us went out for tea at night
Im driving
Porsche Panamera
Carry is sitting on the side
We went to a place in Dubai
Its called Disco Chai
Its an official name
We went there and had tea
The person who was serving us was from Bangladesh
He was 2223 years old
He was a subscriber
He took a selfie with me
Then he saw Carry
He left
Then he came back
Can we take a selfie in front of a car?
We said okay
Carry and I were standing in the middle
He took a selfie
We started drinking tea
He was standing there
He said can we take a selfie inside the car?
I said okay
He wanted a selfie in my car
He sat in the car
Finally he got a photo
He was sitting in the back
I was in the driving seat
Carry was sitting next to me
Were back
Thats good
Gaurav tell us something
Back after 1015 minutes
He said can I sit in the back?
You two can sit in the front
Then he said Gaurav sir can you take a photo?
He gave me his phone
He said hell never get a selfie like that
Theres a car
Im in the driving seat
I took a selfie
Hes sitting behind us
This is inside a Porsche
We left
We discussed
I said if he didnt ask he wouldnt have got a photo with us
He wouldnt have got a photo in the car
He wouldnt have got a selfie
Why did he ask?
Because he had that comfort
Otherwise he wouldnt have got a photo
Here he took 3 good photos
Im sure hell tell a big story around to his friends
This is the difference of approachability
Thank God he didnt say drive the car
I would have driven
As long as Im free
As long as I have time
It doesnt matter
Its only because he was asking for it
I was at the airport
A guy came running
He was using a OnePlus phone
Zen mode
In Zen mode you cant do anything
He took out his phone
I was free at that time
I took a photo from my phone
I asked whats your email?
He got the photo
Otherwise he wouldnt have got the photo
Just because theres approachability
Everybody whos watching the show remember if you meet Gaurav if he has a car make
sure you take it
Its happened many times
All the time
Open offer now
Ill come to that
Specifically asking him
Trolling is anonymous
Weve all developed a thick skin
Im just presuming
We continue with our work
When your peers roast when your fellow YouTubers roast there was an incident with a Tamil
I would want him to talk about that
Recently that happened to me
Where to start?
Weve been in the space for a long time
Most of us got the roasting trolling everything
What we do is we just ignore and we cross
Thats what we do
If time and again youre getting the same kind of thing people will start hate you
for the thing which youre not
Thats where youll feel uncomfortable
It happened to me too
Four years ago a man said something wrong in my name
He uploaded 34 videos
The real face of
The Tamil version of the video about TG in Hindi will be uploaded on my channel
It used to happen
Someone is making fun of someone whos doing the video in Hindi and getting some views
Theyre following the same thing in Tamil
I know this and I ignore it
But it comes to a point where I have to show my identity
card telling this is my name
Tamil Selvan is my name and this is my identity and I dont have to fake it
This is where it started
Theres a story ahead
There are a lot of things
It added up
Recently what happened is I saw a video someone was making fun of two
other channels
One was mine and someones channel
Up to a point I was not worried about that particular
thing because over the past few years I came through a lot
of stuff
I ignored that one
Then all of a sudden I got a lot of negative things
Then I thought what do I have to do?
Either I have to ignore and move on or I have to speak whatever is in my mind
Because there are a lot of pressures I was building for the past few years without
talking anything
Because YouTube we all have our passion profession whatever it is
I mostly dont often spend time with my friends and everything
Most of the time its in my YouTube channel itself
Comment section Twitter everything is there
The pressure got up to me and suddenly whatever that comes into mind I shot a video
But I havent uploaded that
I didnt upload that video
I kept it as it is
I didnt
Then I stopped it
Then I came to know that the other person who was in that video because I initially
texted him bro this is the thing that is happening this guy this particular
channel is talking about both of us
What we have to do?
Because I dont have experience in facing this kind of pure roasting
He said simply ignore
Ignore and move on
I used to do that
I will do that again
But that other guy went on and commented on his channel telling that okay from now on
Im your huge fan
Im your follower
Then all the TV channels all the other YouTube channels all the comment section filled with
hate of this particular guy is the biggest YouTuber
He apologized and he commented you are so rude and you
are not even saying anything
That pressure got into my mind
Then I shot the second video not even thinking anything whatever that comes in my mind I
shot the video
Thats where I was little bit out of the way
Whatever that comes in my mind
I reedited but by that time we had some other issues as well but I committed my subscriber
that I will be uploading the video on Sunday
Every Sunday I will be uploading a video
I know the video is not 100
I dont have the time to check because the video has to go live
So first thing is I have pressure from inside
Second the day is also I have to upload the video
Then I went on with the video
Once the video is live I switched off the phone and everything
I went to sleep
Suddenly the next morning even without seeing the
comments I realized that what have I done?
You made a mistake
I immediately wanted to take the video out and give
something for my viewers
This is not me
This is what is in my mind
I wanted to say this and I said it like this
I was thinking
Then few other people were telling you dont need to go and
do this
Just work on it
Then it started biting
now we are facing the backlash
What is the backlash?
Two years back?
No no right?
No six months
Six months
What is the backlash you are facing?
Negative comments in each and every video
Every video
I talk about Ratan Tata I see the negative comments
I make a review telling the phone itself is not good for
that money its not value for money and people started commenting you are getting some x
amount of money from this brand and you are
How do you come up from that?
How do you all come up from that?
Lets talk about he is not spoken Sanchit is not spoken
which I am very surprised about Sanchit
What is happening?
No no when he told his story it obviously happened to me too
It has happened
Obviously when fellow creators say it it hurts a lot
But the best part is what happened to me
First I developed full hate within myself for a month no doubt
But then in the starting days Shlok and I used to talk a lot when YouTube started
He told me that if you hate a creator you will never be able to learn from him
What I did was when there was a lot of buildup inside hate I said lets convert it into
Lets try to work on all this negative energy
What will happen if you sit quietly in the corner and show anger?
So now I have become a toxic trait for trolls
If I dont get hate I dont get motivation
I look for it sometimes
Gaurav Gaurav
I will tell you a story about Sanchit
I think it was 2017 or 2018
YouTube did a competition
The YouTube community in India was a little weak at that time
I mean the online community YouTubes community
The overall community
So there was a YouTube program where they collaborated with
And they invited for entries
If you want to go on a community post you have to upload
Like if you are a YouTuber just to make sure that the YouTube communitys blog post gets
a little active
So got some I think 34 thousand entries
We shortlisted
And I had to pick two winners with whom I will collaborate
So it was a plan that we did with YouTube
So there were two winners
One I picked Sanchit
One I picked Samreen
Young girl was doing some sketch videos
So we are watching Sanchit right now where he is
And the other one I think Samreen has a lot of millions of followers
And I remember we shot a video in the hotel room
After 2017
Thats a great statement
We shot a video in the hotel room
Amazing statement
How did you feel that time?
We shot a video
How did you feel?
It was very crazy
It was discussed in my entire college that Technical Guruji has made a video with
So it was crazy
It was a very crazy moment
In fact I also told in my JoshTalk that how Technical Guruji had a very big important
part in my life
I will always be thankful to him
Recently Carry Mena TV
Carry is younger brother
What is that?
What happened there?
It was so much fun
Lets have some fun
Let me show you something
Let me show you what Carry had messaged me
I think we spoke the day before yesterday We spoke
the day before yesterday
One second
See this
Let me show you
When Carry uploaded it he said Hello Sir
I made a small parody of yours
I hope I was able to get close to your character and you dont take negative
Really enjoyed playing your character and got to learn a lot
He sent me the link of the video
I was on a flight at that time
I replied to him
Hello brother
How are you?
I just saw the video
I was on a flight
I was coming from New York
I was changing my flight
I was sitting in the lounge and everyone was laughing
I was wearing a laptop
It was solid
It must have taken a lot of effort
Carry is saying Thank you so much
It means a lot
We are having fun
When the iPhone 15 was launched we planned something together again
But at that time I was traveling and you couldnt shoot
The thing is there are two things
If someone is really attacking you for no reason other than
just to bring you down its a different side altogether
In Carrys case we are people from the community
At that time I say see how he is how he is
how I am
Its fun
So the parody he made I mean I am seeing attention to
detail in all the characters
And people have liked my character the most
I am enjoying it
Any thoughts Shlok on roasting?
I also align with the same thing that there are two types
of criticism
One is where there is no meaning to it and they just want
to bring you down
And sometimes there is a way where either people are making fun of us or we have done
something wrong
So a consumer or a viewer may get angry
They may abuse in anger
But it is our job to understand that whether he is trying
to forcefully insult us or he has a problem and he is commenting on us
So I think like in the case of Carry
The good thing about Carry is that I dont know about
I mean if I call him now he will say hello brother how
are you?
He has that image
What you see on camera and what you get behind the camera is a very different thing
Yesterday or day before yesterday I did a reel post on Instagram
Vishal the guy who wrote Carrys sketch
Deepak told me yesterday that he forwarded it to the group
And he tells Vishal that you should take the writing fees from Gaurav
He is also using your dialogue
He is having fun
Now even with IBTR till now there will be so many preconceived notions in peoples
Immediately after looking at this it is going to change
Because behind the camera a lot of things are different
A lot of things are said in front of the camera
Even between tech YouTubers
But actually they might be very good friends and it might be planned
Or it might be said that I am going to talk about this
Before going ahead lets talk and do it
Can I say a small thing?
Its a very small thing
I mean I tell you
If you all align with Shahid I am telling you what I think
This YouTube is a new thing
Its a very new thing
And if you look very carefully at your deep inside it is a
very lonely journey
I mean if I go to my friend I tell him that I didnt get
so many views today
This topic was made
I was talking on AI
People didnt like it
Someone will understand a little
If I talk to you talk to Shlok talk to Gaurav talk to
You will immediately understand that this was your shortcoming
If we do the same work a little closeness
So when there are talks it makes you feel a little relaxed
It doesnt make you feel a little lonely
So I think that in fact not only on the collaboration camera
We should also talk to each other
Because you dont know right now
We have no idea what are the side effects of YouTube
You are so new
So I feel that there is still a lonely journey of tech YouTubers
I feel so
Not tech but any creator
Any creator
Actually there are side effects
I mean we saw what Lilly Singh was also going through and everything
So thats there
You guys also went through some sort of controversies right?
Oh yeah yeah
I was hoping for the next question
No no I didnt know
No I addressed it
Its okay
No no there are a lot
Yeah its the same
Oh sorry
No I didnt know that either
No no yeah
The thing is like you mentioned there are two types of trolls
One is obviously in a fun way that CarryMinati has done
Which is his job
Which he does
And the second is to bring someone down
So what happened with us is that each one of us were working with a certain brand
And we were working with them for such a long time
It was quite clear
Entire tech community was working with them
But one tech content creator did not get to work with that brand
And that pissed that person off
Because of that he wanted to retaliate in some way or the other
We just caught in the crossfire
And it happened that a lot of negativity that came from that video completely shattered
Im not lying
We were completely devastated
We were thinking what did we do wrong?
Because that was what was happening the entire time
And so it happened
And then we thought what should we do?
And we did make a video
But later we realized that we shouldnt have
You shouldnt have
I also I generally dont see videos
That time I had seen that
And I dont
And the best part to let go this is that you should like I
was talking with Sanchit off camera some time ago that if everyone is working on their
own and minding their own business so the other person should not get in the way to
bring someone else down
Because at the end of the day we all have a different
style of working
I might not agree with anyone elses style but that is
their style
I dont get in their way
Similarly I do not want someone else to get in our way
So that has happened with us at that time
So those 345 months whatever they were that was one of the worst periods of our YouTube
And like Sanchit just mentioned YouTube is very lonely
And I couldnt share that problem or discuss it with anyone
No one would understand
And obviously I cant be able to I wont be able to
discuss it with fellow YouTubers as well
Because we dont interact that regularly
We dont interact
It was a lesson learned that whenever something like that happens dont take any action
Just go on and mind your own business because that will be useful and that worked for us
But I think one of the most important things if you notice
all the people who have spoken so far everybody has at the end of it said there was a lesson
I think trolls negativity absolutely agree there are two types of negativity but I think
the comment section is your greatest learning tool
Enemy also
Koi aur nahi aayega aapko guide karne ke liye better because as you said kabhi galti ho
jaye and the people flame you for it you learn from it and become better
He is six months down the line he is a much better where they have gone after the lesson
they have learned
Wo jo ek aapka six months of loneliness tha at maybe your worst period but see where
you are today
Most of it will come from that six month journey
Kitni learning thi kitna lesson tha
You never fail you either learn or you win
I think this is a very important thing
Its not that never fail a lot of times there are
instances where things like this have happened
The channel has gone down views have gone down and the key going down and it never comes
Aise hua hai
Either thing is Ill tell you honestly ignore kar do
that is the best
If someones trying to pull you down it simply means you stand above them
Yeah yeah
Youre important enough for them to want to pull you down
My point was ek bar wo jane ke baad how do you come up especially for an established
Ek baat sunna hai Devendra yeh cheez hui wo phase nikla lets say kal yeh cheez dubara
ho jati hai now you are in a better position to deal
Much better yes
Toh ek baar ka experience tha but now its a learning for
a lifetime
Toh I think jo agar sunn raha hai koi isko abhi jisne wo sakta hai aaj tak yeh phase
nahi kiye hai toh usko already pata hai ki kya karne kyuki hamare experiences hain
Toh I think ignore karo side nikalo aagey badho thats
the best way out
And thats the learning jo idhar se idhar se aari hai
Jaise abhi aapne bola ki jab itna phase down jata hai toh usse bahar kaise nikalna hai
Toh ek simple sa funda hai jo ham apne 1012 saal ki journey mein apply kara hai hamne
and that is always go back to the basics
We just go back to the basics
If you go back to what you were doing and jis cheez ke liye aapko logon ne they have
given you the love you go back to that again do it better with the learning
I think Arun you come back
But Ill tell you again yeh jo basics hai na yeh basics
bhi because of algorithm change hote rehte hai and I dont know how many will understand
this but YouTube pe jo 656 saal chal raha tha basics ki yeh yeh aapne karna chahiye
wo agar abhi aap apply karte ho videos ko your videos
will not work
But Arun Ill tell you the reasons why
Because wo basics ho gaye alag because everyone else has probably gone up wo basics abhi
basics rahe nahi basics have gone to a different level
So according to me you have to keep evolving and understanding
But thats the basics
That is true
Understanding is the basics
I am not saying ki jo basics jaise aap kar rehte hai waise
hi karte hoon
Pehle hum text karte the phir hum videos pe aaye uss time jab hum videos pe aaye
kuch content creation influencer kuch bhi nahi tha
We just did it because humein laga ki kuch gap hai jo hum fill kar sakte hain
So we tried we wanted to do different kind of videos and that worked for us
So our basics was to always evolve like he said ki evolve to karne hi padega ab short
videos agar aa rahe hain agar aap short videos nahi banaoge that means you are harming yourself
Usse kisi ka kuch fayada nahi hone wala ki aap ussi pe gogi nahi mai to long videos
hi banaunga kyuki mere ko to long videos hi banaane aate hain
Short videos is not my thing
That is not my thing
Pivoting is part of being
So basics is that you should always be with the trend
Kahi baar agar ahead of the trend ho toh toh sab sahchi baat hai
Be the disruptor or you will be disrupted is a basic
And I think Shlok what Shlok has done with the overlays I think he is with the curve
ahead of the curve I must say
Jo next category after content hai that is definitely
product and he has built a really nice product
Or not one multiple products
Toh wo ek jacket hai
Yeh jacket kisi ki hai yaar?
Yeh badhi achi jacket hai
Badhi achi jacket hai
Yeh monetization mein ecommerce thats also going to be huge right?
I was coming to this like how do you see it
as a business?
I think this is a great topic even I am going to get into
Main apna waise is pehle purane wale topic mein apna opinion deta hu
Kyuki I feel ki sometimes ignoring is not enough
Kyuki mereko aisa rakhta hai ki market mein jo cheez jada boli jaati ho sach ban jaati
toh agar ek banda kuch bol raha hai and wo das bandon ko inspire kar deta wo same cheez
bolne ke liye toh cheez sach ban jaati agar saamne ala banda reply na kare
Mere kyaal se Off camera hai
Yeh hi wali baat mein abhi aapko bolna chahata jab baaki log bol rahe the ignore ka I completely
agree with you
Mere zaap se theek hai agar matlab it does not make sense aur koi usko wo nahi dera hai
tawajjo nahi dera hai toh it is okay
But agar if it I see it becoming a thing and mereko lagta
hai ki nahi yeh galat hai toh main toh fight karne ke liye ready main apna stand lene
ke liye main laddi pe chal rahe ho
Aap gali mein chal rahe ho aur kuttey aapko attack kar rahe hain ek tarika yeh ki aap
ruk ke her ek pe patthar pekhoge patthar katham ho jayenge suratdarbaad
ho sakta hai aur kuttey bhadte ja rahe hain second option is aap unko biscuit fekho toh
kuttey aap ke beeche pooch laate bheyenge toh my thing is ki agar aap ignore na karo
aur agar aap jawaab dere ho toh bhai thats what they want they want more attention
thats what they want toh wo cycle ban jayega ek hai ki kutton ko jawaab dena
ek hai ki jo actual reality hai wo logon wo dikhana bhai
but wo kab tak karoge wo toh batao but mere kya se at the end toh ignore karna hi padega
at the end toh ignore karna padega but did you answer to the guy who had I remember
this story I dont know how many people remember but jab
ecommerce brand launch ki layers launch kiya tha wo coding ka arre
na aapko simple 3 baat main flight pe tha and you asked me ki maine reply karna chahiye
ya nahi we were going to US or somewhere at that
time na wo simple story azaat hoon ek hua gaya hum website bana rahe the website mein
mockups hote hain sari cheezon hote hain wo publicly available hota hain and
code jo hai aap google ka code copy karo koi aapko kuch bolega nahi kyu hi it is
not copyrighted ya koi ispe patent attendant toh laga nahi humne ek developer hire raha
tha usne halka halka code idhar udhar utha liya and ek jo competitor tha kyu hi hum
market mein agar ghus rahe hain skins ki hum market mein jaa rahe hain toh
of course jo pehle jo competitor uski market jaayegi toh
wo humko bhai publicly aake ki haan yeh kar diya yeh copy karta yeh karta wo karta
hai manager wo theek hai bhai haan hogi hogi galti theek hai koi baat nahi but uske
baad like wo humare upar ek legal notice bhai ne vej diya maine
poore check kar waha hai ki bhai yeh isme kya hai yeh
toh basic cheez
hain mockup toh publicly available hota hain sari cheez hain aisa kuch it is not it is
legally okay to do it yaar Instagram ne bhi
toh stories copy kari hain humne aisa kuch khaas copy nahi kar raha tha humne website
bhi change kar di thi but uske baad we filed ek humne wapas legal notice bheja ki hum
defamation file karenge agar aap jo aap cheez kar raho publicly kar raho
uske baad then he stopped kyunki usko bataegi usko jisko actual solution chahiye hota hai
na wo publicly halla nahi bachaata and mereko wo cheez bhagi ki of course yaar aap kahin
bhi kisi market aap jaoge log peeche kheechne aa jaate hain toh
it depends ki kab reply karna hai kab nahin karna hai so
you replied basically and you took it forward and ab wo
uska kaam ban chuke wo baar baar kuch kuch naya lata rhta hai main dekhta rhta hoon
usko maza aa gaya aise hi humein but even I only
feel like you have to give a reply because we dont have to bottle up our mental health
also because yaar taste wise taste wise agar wo nahi if he does no I myself roster
companies so I he is doing it hot I do skits based on
you know what are the no he is way of thinking its a controller
yeh bahut difficult to understand ki troll ne sach bola hai mere baare mein galat ya
phir wo faalto bol raha hai agar aap realize kar gaye apni mistake toh shayad wo aapki
sabse greatest learning ho
gaye aap curve hi badal raha hai but I agree with Gaurav ki like bhai at the end toh ignore
karna hi padega na haan haan mada otherwise it is going to affect you lets go back to
the question that we are all waiting for what you are doing journey
kaise hai ecommerce if its the big one do you believe that does it take you away
from your core sabse bada question hi hai ki jo jis cheez ne aapko banaya hai kya
usmein ab aap utna hi passion aur time daal par rahe ho content creator?
It mere kya haal se toh 100 it is the future
100 ek product ko agar aap distribution jo mada hum essentially videos bana rahe hain
hum sab log agar aap ek accha product ek aise cheez aap le aao jo aapki audience isme
interested hai it is a billion dollar business I am main usko bilkul kam
nahi kar raha agar audience fit sahi hai jaise
I have talked to physics wala he has built a billion
dollar business Unacademy ke founders bhi start unhoni YouTube se kar raha tha kaafi
saari India mein log hai jino ne business banaya hai YouTube ko leke
bas mere kya haal se dikkat hi ho jaati hai usually jab log start karte hain wo
product ko for granted le leta hai unko lagta hai ki manlab
We can make a product and the audience will buy it
I think to build that product whether its a physics
product or my own reference it took us 3 years to make a skin
It took us 3 years to learn clothes
I have a whole industry to learn
And if I remove the layers from TechBurner because there
is no distribution of TechBurner but layers in itself no
one else in the market is able to beat that product
I am saying globally
No one else is able to make a product like that
Same thing that we are making in clothing HM Zara all the international brands the
price point at which we are making jackets no one is able
to make it
So I think if the product is good then it becomes easy to leverage that thing
But the reputation you have made what you do today the
way you have got love from people credibility from people when you make a product and your
jacket goes out have you not got criticism that it has become commercial?
Number 2 now you are not making yourself vulnerable that people will start saying
I bought a jacket it turned out to be useless my button
came off
I am not saying this is the truth I am saying I keep getting asked this question
Is this vulnerability in your mind at the back of your
I mean when things are going on so publicly and
negativity spreads more quickly
Now if there is a slight delay in delivery if it is of
one person then it will create more noise
The thousands of happy customers lakhs of happy customers
they just put up a photo and stay happy
But negativity spreads
But in our case because the audience showed so much trust this has not happened
There was a very positive response
And I am personally very happy
And I feel very grateful that our community shows so much love
But in my opinion it is obviously your intention
If it is your intention to provide genuine value then the customer in front of you feels
So there is no problem in that
How do you change your audience into a community?
This will be very important
Because there is an audience that watches your videos and there is an audience that
will buy your clothes
So how do you change that?
Or you know how do you build a community in general?
Even BBomb has done it
How do you build a community?
In my opinion there is no rocket science
In my opinion the product is very simple
If you show it well it will sell well
But I will actually call it the opposite
That I felt that when I didnt start this brand that if I
do a promotion then I am selling to the audience of Techburner
They will feel weird
This is my question
But it was the opposite
When we built our product we shared the whole story people got more connected with us
That this guy is doing something he is trying something
And the more we share that we are doing this we are
doing this we are doing all these things we are planning this people get more attracted
And I didnt expect this
I thought it was the opposite
That if we sell people will go away
It has become very commercial
But when we started showing people started coming closer
More people came
And this happens every time
I mean whenever we share our story of layers of
overlays people get more connected
Maybe it is an inspiration
Maybe they see that we are working hard
We are just selling to earn money
But I dont know what it is
But I try that our products that we are making are strong
And your time management are you still being able to put
in the same amount of time that you used to do before in content creation for Techburner?
This is not possible
For a lot of people thats whats missing
I think for everyone
I mean we all work so hard
You are also running so many businesses
We all do different things
And everyone has less time
But earlier I wasnt able to give that much time
Earlier I was a beggar
But there is a difference
Earlier the optimization was not that good
Now things are optimized
I think with time we used to do it in 8 hours
Now we can do it in 1 hour
So if we have 1 hour today its enough for the earlier editing comparison
I think thats done over time
Here its also about team building
You have to build teams also
Thats the most crucial part
I mean I think its your role now to build the best
That also reduces loneliness
Team building reduces a lot of loneliness which I felt
Over time
I dont feel lonely at all
I because it is a onterm journey
I feel I might be alone but I am not lonely
I enjoy it
I am alone but I dont have a problem with being alone
I think community building if it happens community is built then it happens for a
short time
Lets say 5 years 6 years
I feel community is a fear
Like I have a selfopinion
I have made a new theory
Maybe I am wrong
Tell me
I am learning
I think I have made a new theory
It happened after a while
It faded
A legacy what does it do?
It works quietly
I mean I am working
I am doing the same work
I am improving
Its been many years
Come see go
Bro I will give you an example for content creators
Our audience every year people move away from it
The one who was watching us till yesterday he got a job
He is not watching you now
He was in college
He was watching you
And the new guy who got a new phone he will start watching you
So the crop will always it wont be like its been 10 years and he is watching you
since day 1
And if it is like that then his interest may be earlier
it was more
Now he watches you sometimes
What is the difference?
So the crop will always come out and the new crop will come
But what is the difference in what you said?
When you build a community that is a term
And a legacy it eventually comes to the legacy is about community
So what is the difference?
I wish I could name drop a bit but I wont do that
For obvious reasons
I have seen those who have cult following after a time just as a general statement
I am giving someones name lets talk about vloggers
He had a community
Means I will say this if he said today at 12
I am coming here India Gate everyone comes
But over time that cult following goes like this
But if there is a vlogger who is doing his work quietly
and like this means he is not doing community community he is not giving a name
So I have just noticed that the line of the creator
May be I am wrong
But I feel that he is banning his followers in such a
way that do more community community cult following happens
But you are right about one thing till date in history
you from the time humanity has come
This is absolutely right
Cult following its called a cult because it is for a
period of time
There is no such thing as cult following forever
According to me two things like I was listening to everyone so there are two types of people
one type of people who know you and one type of people who want to become like you
So like when a person is young or a child so may be
he wants to become like you
When he grows up then he realizes no I dont want to become like him
I want to become like Shahrukh Khan
Or I want to become like someone else
So the people who
So the people who want to become like you or the things you are doing they want to
do something like that that is your actual follower base community
or cult whatever you want to call it
And the people who know you okay they know you but may be they want to watch your
videos sometimes
So I personally look at it by dividing it into these
If you are doing something different something strong then there is a question here this
community is it same for YouTube also for social media is it the same?
I mean Instagram Facebook everything is different
Everything is different
In fact I also want to ask because we have
Rajivji here you know as a medium you have been on every platform including TV
YouTube social media social media you are doing very very well
How is it different working with community?
I mean how do you build a community on each platform?
Is it different or is it the same?
No actually there is a lot of difference
First example the same person who follows you on YouTube and who follows you on Instagram
he comes with a completely different psychology when he opens Instagram and when he comes
to watch you on YouTube
It could be the same person but he comes with a very
different psychology of what he what he wants to consume on a different platform
When he turns on the TV with what mindset did he turn it on?
When he turns on the radio and he is going home from office to you know somewhere
This community expectation from the same person he can have four different expectations
from you
Number one I think this is a very important realization
for all of us but more important for all those people
who will now come up
That you dont think that your YouTube following has
become very good
So you will go on Instagram even if you have pivoted
very well but the person is not expecting you to do the
same thing
You know you open Instagram you want immediately you may have only one one and a half minutes
you want either just entertainment you want your mind to
be you didnt search for it it was delivered to you
I will also add a secret to this that I like I also when
I go one day I went to the bank I was at work
So I met a girl there she took a selfie with me and all
that And she didnt even know what a tech burner
is She didnt even know that I make long videos
She just saw my video on Facebook And the 3minute video that we cut and put
on Facebook She just saw that video
And then I went and checked That our Facebook audience
The YouTube Shorts audience The YouTube audience
The Instagram audience All of them are 60 different 60 audience
is different everywhere And a lot of people dont even know that we
make long videos A lot of people dont even know that we do tech reviews
A lot of people think that I just upload photos It is like that
You have to have a longformat video Even for Shorts and for Reel
You cant just put whatever you made for the Reel
You have to put a little short If you take for granted a platforms community
or following You will not be able to build anything ever again
So Arun the answer to this thing is that Community building is per platform
It is not If I take my TV audience
It will definitely come It will get some initial momentum
Because people are like I have seen this on TV
But the rest of it Has to be organically built
And it is for that platform only Right As an entire
I have so many platforms I dont use the word community Which platform
Gaurav Which platform do you think is more relevant
Or probably the platform of the future Next What is the next big thing
Lets hear it from everybody Lets start from Arun
Whats the next big thing?
Reels is going to be the big thing for me
Its been 3 years
It will continue
It will continue for sure
Because they are already working on EIS and a lot of stuff
So it will continue
I think Instagram Reel is doing pretty well right now
But I dont see it as a longterm thing
I think people will get bored eventually
But we dont know when that will happen
Lets hope it doesnt happen
We are working so hard
But yes next
Ill answer
I think the next big thing is going to be Metaverse
And that is what I believe
Something big is going to happen
But it will take time
Its not like it will happen tomorrow or the next year
YouTube Shorts will coexist
But yes one thing that I see as a platform is that the shoppable experience social commerce
will increase with the help of Shorts with the help of Reels
And Im seeing that as of now there are links in the description
So TikTok has been testing this in other countries
As soon as I wear a Tshirt or an overlay coat on the
video if I tap on it from there only I can buy anything
You know you actually answered the next big thing already
So take it back
That without it looking like it is commercial ecommerce great content without making
you say buy this do this you will have to do it organically
But that is where the future really lies
Id love to hear from you
MetaQuest I dont think its going to take long
Even I in three to four years
How many of us have used MetaQuest 3?
If you use it you immediately come to know that is what is going to really appeal to
the audiences in coming two three years
Photos are still messy
So not a lot of people
Who does all this mess?
You can see the potential
I disagree
I was taught as a kid to sit a little further away and
watch TV
The small TV 30inch TV sit a little further away and
watch it
A small 30inch TV
What is a 21inch TV?
I had a 21inch TV
You know the eyes are here
4K 4K two TVs with the eyes here
Put the headset on and watch
I dont find it healthy
Its a matter of health too
See again this is the difference between Gen X Gen Y Millennials
The people who are 12 13 14 15 16 17 years old have these two
They will be on it all the time
Because you dont have that baggage
I dont think its healthy
Its healthy
Thats a different topic altogether
AI is it healthy or unhealthy?
Its different
Im saying that there has been a lot of testing even for
you know beyond Gen Z also
The thing that is humanly very awkward no one does it
Why do 3D glasses fail?
Why do people not want to watch 3D movies?
Even in the cinema hall we dont
To strap on something to keep something on that is not generational
But everybody is expecting the Apple Vision Pro to change things
I completely disagree
I feel that it will be the biggest failure for Apple
I used PS VR to make that video in 25 days
I vomited three times to make that video
Thats what Im saying
Ive been doing it since then
Youre using it while youre standing and moving
Its a different thing
If youre watching a movie while sitting its a different thing
If you are moving content around you is moving
For example FPV drones you cant fly it while standing
A FPV drone pilot will always fly it while sitting
Because if he flies it while standing he can see that Im flying
He cant feel the gravity
So theres a disconnect
Its the same thing
But if you do it while sitting its a different thing
Theres a test Im talking about for 12 to 15 year olds
95 of them said after 15 minutes
The wow factor
The world Ive gone into
After 15 to 20 minutes would you buy it?
Would you want to do it again?
94 said no
But the harsh reality is whether you like it or not there will be a change in the future
But is this the future?
Is this the future?
Its not in perfect form
Please understand
Its in its third generation
It will be much easier
Youll be wearing glasses
You remember the Google Glass?
It was back in 20112012
I think something will happen
If it comes in contact lenses I see a future
I think it makes reality happen
Vision Pro
And even nowadays like the iPhone is coming up with special videos
I feel Apple I dont know if they have a plan but what
if theyve come up with a different platform where you can load special videos so that
it will be more lively
Maybe thats something which can be looked at
Youll still have to wear it
Yeah but maybe like what Guruji said what if its like a glass?
Eventually it will go that way
It cant be that big
It cannot carry that
I remember my first VR experience
It was with Samsung S7
When S7 and S7 Edge came the Galaxy VR where you had to put your phone
The phone had a quad HD screen
So comparatively it used to be sharp
And at that time it had all those different theater modes
that it will create a virtual theater
I think it was in 2016
It was fun
And today when I tried Apple Vision Pro in June
I had a 45 minutes indepth session
It was night and day
I mean theres no comparison from any VR to Apple VR
Google Cardboard to Apple VR
Google Cardboard where your phone is connected
The phones used to be so big
And today theyre folding
Basically things will change in the future
It would be like a normal glass
This has a camera
This has a speaker
In this youll see the position and everything
Were going to move forward with smartphones
Whether its 5 or 10 years from now
What is the one future tech that you are seeing future in?
I mean AI
Variable technologies
Humane kind of things
Maybe you
I dont think its a replacement for a smartphone
Thats very clear
You know the next big thing can be but its not a replacement for a smartphone
Were talking about two completely different devices right?
Even though I did a video on Instagram
The death of the smartphone
Got millions of views
I showed it to Humayun
But the point of it is that if you are really really
truthful thats not a smartphone replacement
No but sir eventually what my opinion here is today we have a mobile phone that does
all our work
At one time we needed a calculator
We needed Walkman
Digital cameras
Multiple things
Today phone is capable to do everything
166 standalone devices replaced by a smartphone
So phone is the hub
When we go to a brands presentation they always show their chart
This this this
Phone is in the center
Four things
Smartwatch this this
This is the thing
Today the phone is capable to do everything
But if you dont have a phone you forgot your house then you are handicapped
You cant do anything
So this still is a hassle that I have to carry this device with me
If I dont have this then Im nothing
I have to charge this
I have to see this
The future would be where we can replace this with something that is in me
Or with me altogether
You guys are like into things going inside your body?
Not at all
It can be a chip
No no
I would not prefer that
But but
Put it nicely
You know
Those are not called wearables
They are called insertables
And just by the name itself I think its weird
I dont want an insertable in me
I mean maybe a smart band that Im wearing
Projecting things
Or a glass or something
I mean eventually something that is with me
I mean without even me having to think about whether Im keeping it or not
It is part of me
And it will happen
Im with him
We dont have to carry the tech
In this I have a challenge
Right now the biggest problem is that if I have an image in my mind or if I have some
information in my mind if I want to put it in my mobile then I just have fingers
I will have to type with my fingers or I can speak with my
I think the next big thing that will come because I have the same problem with the watch
I have the same problem with the eyeglasses
I think the next big thing that will come is that its a little weird to put a chip
in the brain
But there are such technologies that have come now
Neuralink has also come
There are a few more things
Which directly interact with our brain
Im telling you
Think of an example
We have smart homes now
Alexa is on
Light is connected
I will tell it
Alexa turn on the light
Its a good thing
But still I have to say the best would be that I just have to think that
I think thats the future
It will happen in 10 years
In 10 years
We are ready for that
It has to happen
And this is a possibility
In medical terms I think nanotech and everything will be better
But I feel something which is connecting
A part of a tech connecting our brain cells
I mean I disagree with that
Maybe that might be the future
I think that will be the future
The voice will be better
This that everything
There will be telepathy 100
Thats what I was expecting
So think about it
I will send you a love letter
Not having to carry the tech is what we are going towards
This is going to happen
And one thing I also feel like the way AI is coming and right now
we are simply using the generative AI to help our daytoday tasks
But in the future I think maybe if smartphone companies are able to implement it nicely
then everyone would have a personal assistant of their own tuned to their habits
their tasks everything
And its possible that in 2024 AI could be a big buzzword or marketing term for smartphones
to come
2023 was the buzzword and marketing term for AI
2024 will be the result of that
I think so far the person who is using AI yes its great that this person is right
But in 20242025 the job of the person who is not using AI will go
It will go 100
And this means that AI will become a need
And at this time it is so powerful I can show you a video
But what exactly are we supposed to catch up with AI?
I think everything will be replaced
Every single thing
What is the thing which we have to catch up?
At least get to know how to use AI
But why?
You need to be in the But why do we need to walk to AI?
There are people So that to you okay
You said but why?
If you are using AI you are able to do what you do right now
Youll be able to do it 10x better 10x faster
But if you are not then like he was saying next year the person who is doing it will
be 10x better and 10x faster than you and youll be left way behind
But what exactly are we looking at?
Ill show you one thing
Its a tool that can be used No see thats the whole point is that if
you start saying which tool?
You look See this thing is not going out only to us
content creators out here
Its going out to the rest of the world
Here many different people will come from different professions
The point is not which
The point is what do you do and which AI is applicable to you?
When you wake up in the morning and you go to sleep at night you do 78 core tasks every
day right?
Out of those 78 core tasks how many can now help with AI?
From imagination to your thinking to your scripting to coming up with an idea
But like I said that scripting part is like its some
A computer is generating that idea for you
Im not saying its perfect right now
But its not perfect
But thats not the point
Computers are generating ideas
How is it doing?
Large language models basically they are trained to think like humans
So the way we have got education the computers have been trained they have been given large
data set
But do you think that the time will take Let me tell you an interesting thing
It will be clear to you
When humans heard about fridge for the first time all the industries thought make a fridge
There is money in it
It will be in everyones house
The one who earned the most money was the one who had cold beverages
CocaCola Maza
The one who used that fridge cooled it down and put it
back in its place
So AI is that thing
AI is a fridge
The one who will use AI to make tools that will work
The second part which is a layer up that AI needs a lot
of data
So I am telling you the biggest companies in the future
will be more rich will have more data and crazy things
will come out
This is a reality which we should understand
Even we dont know what AI is going to be
We can only talk but AI is that fridge from which we
dont know what byproduct is going to come out
This is a fact
Now will you keep a cake or a drink in that fridge or a
healthy salad?
That is on you
Or maybe beer
According to me AI will change the entire content industry
We wont have to make videos
And it is possible I will show you one video
And This video
This is 100 AI
Neither is it my voice nor is it my video
nor have I written the script
All these things are AI and it is possible right now
And I am telling you right now I just have to input my face into a software
and it will make a video for me
I have a friend Varun Maya
He has an AI page and 70 of the videos are AI
And people dont even know
People dont even know that he is talking about AI
The voice is also mapped the person is also mapped
I am telling you if this is happening right now 100 years from now what will happen
after 5 years?
What is the end game of this?
What will happen after this?
What are we supposed to do?
If you dont have to do anything
Yeah what are we supposed to do?
But sir raw conversations wont survive like this
Point of view
Now AI is trained on large data sets
They dont have emotions
There is no emotional intelligence
Creativity emotional intelligence that humans and they bring perspectives
Like what we are discussing right now everyone has a different perspective
AI it has been trained on large data
It is a data set
There are no emotions
And most of our decisions which we make are emotionally done
At least 30 40 50
But you can bring a lot of that emotion with the prompts that you choose
So now when we are talking about video when we pick it up the emotion that we feel that
AI can never give
Thats why your personal point of view will always be important
I think AI so just I got to know yesterday there is an AI
named Delpy
So what it does is it analyzes all your Twitter all your Facebook ID whatever the data you
put on in your mind
Because the same thing whatever you have said so far personally
In your point of view it analyzes everything and it is available 24x7
It replies to the comments or it replies to the tweet of
our audience in such a way that we used to do that
You know Arun you can give a prompt saying that if we give this phone to Arun Prabhu
Desai what would be his first six emotional reactions?
And you will be very surprised it will be the same six
So I can quiz you at that time
I will ask you six questions from your AI generative model then I will ask you five
of them will be the same thing
Let me tell you this again in fact goes to prove my
What you put on social media on Twitter is it what you
You put your what you want others to see about you
Not you in particular
You are talking about that only
You will put AI outside only
Most of the time online
You will put AI outside
But see like I said the data is still being collected
And it is going to collect for another five so I think it
will get perfect
Another five years
Its like I would give an example that AI is like a
Whatever you teach that child it will learn
And you teach it that if someone abuses you you should get angry
Or if this happens you should do this
Like we teach a child to walk to get angry to eat this
not to eat this
You can teach the same thing to AI
It takes ten years to teach to a child and five minutes to teach to AI
You scan a PDF of the whole book and send it to it to read it and deliver it to me
And that book learns it
And you give that photography book to the AI chart board and that photography will
learn it
You tell it to generate a photo it will do it
So if we basically what AI is whatever data you feed it
it does it
You cannot feed emotions
I am saying that too
Its emotions are different
Yours are different
Mine are different
Because that has come from how we have been brought up
Our experiences as a whole that the people who are sitting now mine every person sitting
here today my thought process is different
You thinking about everyone else is different
It cannot be the same
It is with the individual
And you cannot teach that to AI
But Arun your question you are seeing this you are now putting two different things together
Your personal life and the life that you have outside
We were talking about can we make a video
No I was talking about emotions
Can you make a video that is completely trained like he is speaking completely trained on
every single thing you have ever output to the world
Not personal not what you are thinking of us right now
Whatever you have shown your personality outward to the public till date that can be trained
I am giving you this guarantee that if you will say after
that training that Arun is sitting here and we have asked your training six questions
What would be your six emotional reactions for the public?
They will be pretty accurate
Then my question is do you have to promote such a thing?
No it is not about what we are promoting or not
It is going to be there
See he said like about the AI tool but if this is the
thing like if it can generate the emotion or it can
replicate what you are outward persona
Personality your personality
There is a big difference between generating emotion and outward persona
How can it have that emotional intelligence?
It might take
The emotional connect might take some time
Maybe it takes
But who is going to get emotional intelligence?
It might take some time
See how do you get emotional intelligence from outside?
What is important is what you are going to get emotional intelligence from?
You might get emotional intelligence from How are you going to feed your emotional intelligence
which you have built over the last 2030 years with experience?
Even with the AI There is a whole field called psychiatry
That is also part of AI right?
And what you are talking about that is our formative
years my 2030 years as a human being
But that formative years is also part of psychiatry
This is a very very dense topic to get into
Yeah okay
Lets leave it at See I like the generative AI whatever we
are using at the camera processing and all those
That is fine that is harmless
But I am like thinking about what will be If you unlock this thing
Everyone is worried about it
Its just not you
Everyone is worried
Shloka is shown as just a deep fake very simple straight forward
I have shown it to you already
What about I have seen it somewhere else
But whatever is in the past And to talk about just the To do the deep
fake that he showed right now
Actually what a deep fake
Its like I have fed all the information in my body language where I move my hand like
this move like that give expressions like this
So I fed all the information and in a deep fake the face changes
This is my whole For instance there is a legal case of Bruce Willis
There was an advertisement of a Russian Vodka of Bruce Willis
You can all see it online
He never went to Russia
He never shot for it
His thing
Approximately 1000 hours of video was actually fed in
That he has a tick here
When he says this word his eye
moves like this
The whole thing was fed in
And the whole ad deep fake they have never paid him for it
It happened in Russia
Very dense legal thing
So that is And you know there are now contracts that are being given to people
in Hollywood
So this whole thing that is coming In every which way AI is coming faster than
you can respond to it
AI will take our job
I have full confidence
Like either it will be us who do it or it would be someone else
I think its like saying that which website will be popular
on the internet
Internet is the thing that is going on
So AI is the framework
Now which website which prompt which That is not the point
Because new ones will keep coming
New ones come every 2 weeks
So its like the framework you have to learn
By prompting I mean you learn to tell AI
Learn to talk to AI
Or feed AI what you want it to do
A lot of people have a problem with that
A lot of people are in English right now
Prompt engineering
How to get a job
There are I have seen and I have read about it
There are some people who put up an ebook with brilliant chat GPT prompts
And they have been making millions of dollars
Just by telling and teaching people how to use AI in a better way
If you know your prompts right you can get really good results
Sir give it to me
Give me the link
Sir I dont have it
Everyone thought that the lower level jobs AI will finish first
But the opposite happened
Creativity finished first
Its shocking
I spoke about this that day at that event
Its so shocking
And really we are at the red spot right now
There is a lot of investment in the lowest level
Because in that you need In the everyday mundane jobs you need robotics
to actually close that action
If you are a blue collar worker if you are making
There is a point
Did you see Teslas new robot video?
It is crazy
It is like an actual human
That balance panel
There is a coffee shop in Dubai
Something about that
In Dubai festival city
And it is not there since today
It has been there for the past 23 years
There is zero staff
Do you know what happens there?
You go
Its a huge platform
Its such a big platform
There is seating on the edges
You go and sit on the stool
There is an iPad in front
There is a menu
You order
You are ordering
You pay
In front there is a barista
He is a robotic arm
You can see the robotic arm in front
He opened it
He poured milk
He is doing all the human actions in the robotic arm
He will do everything
He placed his order on the tray in front
He knows that he has come to you
You drank coffee
You left
There is no one in the entire shop
There is a cashier
For that matter there is not a single person
So Gaurav look at its investment
Robotic arm and other things
But it is one time investment
Generating AI is only software building on more software
Sir it is very expensive
Sir it is needed for that too
But it is done for easy rounds
But it is easy
But an interesting thing that we can take out for the viewers
What we are talking about is for someone to start content creation now
You think you dont even need a studio
You sit in a chair at home
AI has made the studio
There is a camera
There is less light
AI has enhanced the light
There is noise in the voice
AI has removed that
So for someone to start the content creation journey today
Using all the AI tools
Yeah even I support that kind of AI
With one click Listen
So with one click With one click you have made captions
With one click your script is ready
So I think the struggle that we did
Anyone can be a creator
5 years 7 years ago
AI will be dubbed
That struggle has reduced today
If you are smart enough how to use AI
This could be a good thing
One more thing is clear
AI is the next big thing
We have talked so much about this
I have said this from the beginning
Always going to be AI
But AI will be the biggest thing
It will be smart
Okay guys
We have to take a break for 2 minutes
2 minutes
So it was a deep conversation actually
So lets come back to a little you know rooted topic
Something that we covered day in and day out
You know we ran on that
So how is 2023?
How is 2024 looking?
Have the prices become aggressive?
Are we going back to preCOVID days?
When you know shocking prices from POCO F1 were there
Are we going back to that?
That is not going to happen
Not going to happen?
But it seems like iQOO
With 12
The new 7 Pro that came
It was very creative
With iQOO 12 I feel again
That that part of it is starting to come again
Because if someone takes a brand lead
Others have to follow
And I think with hygiene coming into technology
Where everything is more or less becoming
You know very easy to put together
Or wow factors of smartphones have become lesser and lesser
I think price aggression will come back
Yeah because I feel the same
Because first of all smartphone adoption has plateaued
I mean there is no growth in the market
The 153 million peak that we took in 2019
That plateaued to like below that
And there has to be some sort of impetus
To rise right?
For the market
Basically you can never play on price
In a longer run
You can never do it in any business
If you think that I will become aggressive in price
And I will make the market
You cant make it
You will make it today
But it wont be long lasting
Biggest learning Xiaomi
Showed how aggressive it is
No one buys a Xiaomi phone for 25000
It doesnt sell
No one buys a Xiaomi phone for 70000
But you can be aggressive at each category right?
But I am just saying that
If we are aggressive at iQOO 12
iQOO 12 is good
But the problem is
iQOO 12 is selling a phone for 50000 today
Lets say they are very little margins
It is possible that they can take a loss
For some duration
Just to establish themselves
But they cant repeat it for 5 years now
So the price game can never run long
You cant wait for
Here I have a point
I am not talking about
Or having less price
Selling at a loss
I dont think so
The thing is
All the issues
Because of which
The smartphones price has had rocketed
They are gone
Those issues are resolved
But they were removed long back
It was till mid2022
It was oversupplied
Not oversupply
A lot of stock was left
And this particular time
They have removed it
All the stock
So a new stock will come
The issues
Earlier they used to demand more from outside
Now India is manufacturing
A lot of things which were there earlier
I think in the days of 2019
We will see such days
Without pricing
Its not one brand who will do it
I will tell you honestly
Just think through
Give a basic thought
We used to see a phone for 10000 or 15000
4 years back
And we used to think
We are getting so much in that phone
Dont know why
As customers
And even as ourselves
The standard rate of inflation
We also think
How can a mobile phone be for 10000 or 15000
We always want it to be for 10000
How can we get it?
Inflation is happening in the world
It is existing
What we are getting as an advantage is
The technology is getting better
At the same time
So we are getting some things at a lower price
But at the same time
Price will increase eventually
Everything is increasing
Biscuits are increasing
Water is increasing
Inflation is there
67 inflation
But technology has always been antiinflation
The laptops that used to come
And the exact laptops
I am not talking about the same specs
I am talking that same category
You are obviously getting it better
Because production improves
The overall quality of what you are doing improves
Economy of scale kicks in
I think its fine
The phone for 10000
You were getting 625
Now you are getting G85 G90
I am not talking about that
I am not talking that the price of the same spec comes
I am saying because technology improves
Becomes better
Do remember that
The amount of hardware that is made
You are seeing improvement in the phone
There is a lot of difference in their manufacturing
If you have an OLED TV
TV that comes in at a particular price point a much better
one will come at maybe 80 lower a little later
Because production and economy of scale became better
So when you are actually I am now predicting that in 2024
you are going to see a lot of the things that went wrong in COVID the oversupply
Why did the oversupply come?
They actually have invested far more now to get things done
So the actual advantage of that will go to consumers
You will get better products at a lower price in 2024
without undercutting
Ill ask a simple question
Tell me whats your answer
Samsung S24 Ultra is launching in January
If the world goes from one place to another can its price
be lower than the S23 series?
But when you talk about the highest flagship that is not
what is happening
But I am just saying
I mean when Apple Airpods 3 will come will it be cheaper
than Airpods 2?
No I have a question
I have a thing
Lets say we all are going to agree something like S23 is a good phone
Like this year we got a release
Do you think that someone can I mean with the software support and the performance
I am pretty sure that in 2025 S23 is a good phone
So if there is a chance that if that phone is available in
a very low price I think people can buy it right?
Yeah I mean
I mean technology is that
That is fine
But all I am saying is the reason for the price to go up
I mean the iPhone will start to be made in India
But if someone says that iPhone 16 is being made in India completely can its price be
lower than the current price of iPhone?
But both your examples are at the highest one
This is at the highest level but that is not really the
topic we are talking about
Alright alright alright
What we will do is a midrange normal phone okay which in the last year and in the last
year it was available for Rs 25000
Today you will get a better phone in every aspect whether it is display performance
You are going to get it for less than Rs 25000
Are you saying that we are not getting better phones
because you said that the price is going to increase
The price is increasing
If you are getting more phone for the same price even today
You will get more phone for less price is what we are saying
If the technology is enhanced then its obvious
If you compare the phone from 3 years ago with the phone from 3 years ago then its
also enhanced
No not that
We have seen that with time
In the beginning there was a fingerprint scanner in a phone for Rs 50000
Today you can get it in a phone for Rs 10000
You know whatever
So technology always trickles down
What brands do is if they are selling an expensive item they will earn all their maximum
profits and then they will introduce a lower tier variant of them
I dont understand what both of you are saying
Are you saying that phones are getting expensive?
He has something to say
I would say I would break it down
According to me the company that was trying to sell at a low price it doesnt have a
profit to experiment and make a new thing
Thats what you told me
You cant play for a long time at a price
I agree
You can play by reducing the price
But the market now is that you cant give better specs at a lower price
You have to do higher price better quality
I will give you something that you will immediately relate
The jacket you are wearing now maybe you bought this fabric from a Japanese supplier
Now the Japanese supplier you have he has invested maybe 1 billion dollars to make something
much better at a lower price
Much better
He has invested a lot
You will give that advantage to your customer right?
A better product at a lower price because you are being enabled to do it now
First of all someone should make it
No one can make it
And because we are making it by doing a lot of research
that is one of our incentives
Because in skins and everything else we have invested crores then we are able to make
Someone else has to make it he has to invest crores
I am talking about you
Your input this fabric you import from Japan that guy
that supplier has improved his production and material and he can now give it to you
at 10 lesser and it is 10 better
Now you will buy the product from him right?
But we wont reduce the price right?
Thats the thing
Because The market will go down
The market will go down
The customer will not get that advantage
We wont introduce that as a We wont introduce Overlace as a cheap brand
No we are going on a different topic
Its not about Its not about
Lets keep the atmosphere light
What do you think about bank offers?
What is your take?
One of the biggest game changers of 2023
Not bank offers the nocost EMI has been one of the biggest game changers of 2023
But it was there earlier also
No no now it is true nocost
Earlier it was a very fake one
They used to make mistakes in calculations
Today a lot of people come to me
They used to say you know tell me in 30000 rupees
Now peoples question has changed
And they say you know at a budget of 3000 rupees a month which is the phone to buy?
So the psychology of buying is changing
And that is a huge game changer
Huge game changer
Thats why iPhones have been sold a lot
Thats why
What an amazing scheme this is
No doubt there will be bank offers credit card offers nocost offers
I think all this has given a lot of benefit to India
In general
But let me throw one more question out
Because I find it very interesting that when I get replies back
In 2019 iPhone total market share was less than 1
It is approximately now at about 7
I mean if you show any other brand that they have increased 700 in 4 years
But where is the growth?
Is it in the Like this year did the iPhone 15 make this
growth happen?
Or is it the iPhone 11 and the 12?
Always last year
But Is that good for a brand?
But Okay
So I will tell you one thing
And I think you all will agree on this
The iPhone which has increased by 1 or 2 and has now gone up to 5 6 7
It will increase more
It can never decrease
I will tell you the reason for that
Everyone wanted an iPhone
Everyone wanted it
They were not able to buy it at one time
Or there was a barrier of starting price which was very high
Should I give a contradiction to this?
No listen to me once
Why did they want it?
Because someone else did not have it
Because it was a good phone
iPhone is a good phone
I mean iPhone is a good phone
There was also a reason that there was an exclusive thing
But sir we felt that it has sold a lot
Listen to me
But when you see tier 2 tier 3 that aspiration is still
It is still there
I am saying that it is still there
People who do not have it still want it
They want it
Every year we see that the price of old phones goes down
Old phones are still good for another 345 years
The way because the iPhones are made
And at the same time peoples salaries are increasing
People are changing new jobs
Money is coming into the market
So at the end they will buy the same thing which they
wanted to buy
So by doing this more new people are going to join in this
But there is no drastic change in technology also when it
comes to phones
Its just a big thing
See okay
I mean the latest ones which have been released
Today almost all the phones in the market they are good enough phones
There was a time when there were bad phones and good phones
Today for every phone if lets say not you are the
target someone else is the customer and they are happy
with those phones
iPhone is also good
Samsung is also good
All these are good phones today
So if you come to nitpicking you will find 15 shortcomings
in every phone
No one is perfect
But its a good phone
It gives you a good experience
And thats the reason people want to buy it
Because its a good phone at the end
Samsung is also good for that matter
No iPhone is more affordable now actually
So because of it because of it being So now lets paint a scenario that the aspiration
tier 2
tier 3 is because you have it I dont
I aspire to it
When iPhone will be in the 20 market what will be the aspiration?
Sir there is such a big market in the US it is still sold
Because the phone is good
But sir our population is very big
Dubai Dubai there is no carrier in Dubai
Take it it is sold there too
Basically let me tell you one thing
Lets say something is good genuinely good
If its market share is 80 then you will not stop buying
Thinking that its market share is 80 thats why you will stop buying it
No but its aspiration decreases
No but still you will
But the population is very big
I am not Listen if in India Apple has got 20 then
they will be in trouble
Sir it will happen
It will happen
You will get 20 soon
You wont get it today you will get it after 2 years
But I agree to what he said
There was a time when people used to see Apple as a very
premium product
We wanted to acquire it
But now the thing is that lets say everyone has it
But everyone has the access to buy the phone
So I feel the market is more like you know people that have a midrange phone
They are the ones who are going to look up to all these flagship phones
I actually did a reel on this exact emotion where earlier 5 years back if you bought
an iPhone or if you are using it everyone is looking at you
And then It was quite funny I saw it
But the point is that is actually happening
But still I also agree that the iPhone sales will increase
No I am not saying that it will increase
I am saying that it will increase by 1015
I said that if there is a good product in the market and we all use it will I stop
using it just because But its wow factor will decrease
Sir it doesnt matter
The wow factor of the phone is never less
I feel We made it
No sir we made it
They want to say something for the longest time
One of the benefits of the iPhone is that lets say we are using any iPhone for 2 years
its resale value is much better compared to any other Android phone
And in the Indian market that is very important
That is very important
But why is it so?
For the same aspirational reason because Okay what you can afford the other person
Because till date as sir has mentioned buying an iPhone was an aspiration for many people
So there is a scarcity in the market of seeing an iPhone
Now everyone is using the iPhone
Do you see 2024 or 2025 iPhone will have the same resale value as before?
There is a huge room for growth I think
There is a huge business now which is refurbished
And already in the refurbished market iPhones prices have dramatically dropped
Second thing in this Diwali there is also you know
there is all these analysts that work now
A very interesting thing came out through these analysts in corporate the most wow
thing to give to somebody big corporates like someone is working with a huge company
they are sending 100 iPhones as gifts
Lowest number of iPhones were sent this year
Do you know what replaced it?
Folding phones
Because the wow factor of folding phones was very low
And tomorrow Apple will get a fold
It will be worth 4 lakhs and people will buy it again
What happened now 2023 there was a shift to the wow factor of folding phones
Alright one question now we are talking about iPhones sales
In India how many people buy iPhones for the software hardware optimizations the
you know really good looks and good camera?
And how many of them buy just because it has that brand value?
It is because there is an iPhone thats why
So what will be Should I answer?
There are a lot of people who change their new iPhone on day one
There are a lot of such people
There are a lot of people who will change their iPhone after 34 years
But there are a lot of people who dont care
What is the percentage?
Listen listen
There are a lot of people who dont care if the iPhone is worth 2 lakhs 3 lakhs or 5
They dont care
They are using the iPhone and they will buy it
Maybe they are on the ecosystem
They dont care about the ecosystem
They may not even use 5 of the iPhone on their phone
All they are doing is just phone calls and WhatsApp
But just because they have the money
They just have to have it
They have the money
They have to have it
They buy it
They will buy 10 pieces of iPhone on day one and gift it to their family
Those who have to have it still continue
This is number one
Number two
Those people who are coming in the creator space
Because iPhone is such a robust device
Those young guys
They will buy a phone and they know that this is the phone which will be able to do multiple
things in once
I can also edit on it
I can also shoot on it
The camera is also good
Everything is good
Instagram works well for example
They will get that
In todays date
The people who are buying only because of the Apple logo
That number is less
And what happens is
Earlier also when there was a number where only the Apple logo was flexing
Till the point he actually bought that phone
That thought will be there
But once they start using it
Then its no more
Their next phone will be iPhone only
I will add one more thing
I think the person who drives the purchase
I will break down a secret of the iPhone ad
That if you ever give an ad of iPhone
In that a normal person will not use it
They will show that a person is going
Climbing a mountain
Coming down 50 meters in the sea
So I think he drives the sale of a product
That is when professionals start using something
Now you will see
In India or in the whole world
All the cinematographers are using the iPhone
All the gamers
No matter where they get sponsors
But they are actually streaming on the iPhone
So all the professionals
It is visible that they are using the iPhone
All the DJs have MacBooks
They dont need a screen
And the normal consumer
Follows this audience
Follows the professional
Have you worn a watch ultra?
Are you really the target customer for watch ultra?
You are not the
Where are you going to climb the mountain?
I dont know about you
I said it
But okay
The watch is targeted for extreme sports
Normally like that
Since the launch of watch ultra
All the people I have met
Who used to use Apple watch
Till yesterday
Series 6 7 8
Whether they are the target customers or not
They are all on ultra now
Majority of them
And the simple reason is
Because this is
Battery is also broken
Battery is one of the biggest reason
Battery is the biggest reason
To whom ever I have spoken
But 3 raise 1 is nothing
Apart from battery
The reason is
Because this is the most expensive Apple watch
This is the latest one
They need to have it
And thats the reason they have it
I have seen people
Which one are you wearing?
I have seen
I am wearing a Rolex
And I am not wearing a smart watch right now
This is a very strange situation
Forget that
My point is
I will ask you an example
I will ask you a simple question
And I will tell you my reaction to it
When Samsung launched Fold in India
Or when it was launched in the world
The idea was targeting towards professionals
Who will work on the go
Okay I agree
To a certain extent
Some people who actually do business
And they need a fold phone
And they used the phone
Their life is changed now
And I will tell you
If we get the data of Samsung
If we can tell something from Samsung
In Delhi NCR
All the people who have money
They have kept 2 folds
And they have no business
They dont do anything in the phone
I have seen this
In Pune too
And in Pune too
And Samsung
The sales that Samsung got in India
Of the folds
They have got it from them
Very few people from business
But the one who had money
The one who was able to buy
He bought it
Leave it in Delhi
Same thing is there in iPhone
It is there in folds
They show you how to climb a mountain
How to swim in the sea
I am saying
They have kept their watch
And they are tracking their steps
In my opinion
The professionals and top tier people
Those who are using
Noravrandha follows them
So it is the same thing
After listening to all your talks
After summing up
What I felt
I will tell you
Because you really got to learn
One thing is understood
Apple is one of the super lucky companies
If the aspiration ends
Lets take an example
The aspiration is over
Everyone has an iPhone
Their foundation is so strong
That the ecosystem has come
Maybe you will buy airports
Their sale is increasing
Subscriptions and multiple things
Subscription has come
As you named it
It became popular among the creators
We have seen
The product becomes popular
In the middle of the community
If it is in the middle of the creators
Then he will buy a MacBook
And Atom is also good
Final Cut Pro will buy
Lucky word
I used it wrong
The foundation they have built
Their branches
That is very solid
It will be strong
I will give you an example
Poco community
Xiaomi community
Any brand
Realme community
iQoo community
All the Android communities
If Xiaomis product
Becomes popular
If Xiaomis phone
Is coming in the bracket of 10000 or 15000
Redmi Note
Which used to come at one time
All those community members
They are joining in
They are using the Redmi phone
They are a part of the community
You tell them tomorrow
Take this
Your iPhone
They will leave the community immediately
They dont have that brand attachment
Just because
Given his scenario
His situation is
His affordability is till there
He is doing that
The day
He is able to afford an iPhone
He will buy a second iPhone
He doesnt have any attachment to Redmi
I would disagree
To some extent
Brand loyalty
You get this
I would just say
Like premium customers
Redmi is not premium
I am talking about Redmi
I am talking about less than 15000
In a less priced point
But like some Vivo customers
And I have seen many Samsung customers
Samsung and Apple
Are on a level
Oppo as well
Oppo and Vivo
Very strong this time
This budget range
One question
If we shift from the iPhone
Which brand according to you
Which brand
Is the most popular
I mean
Which is most popular
And according to you guys and it might be controversial which brand first?
And we are going to talk to Bebop and Tamil
Which brand in 2023 do you think did the best brand of smartphone?
In Android no?
In Android
To make it interesting it has to be one
If we say that then you wont know
OK so for me it may be iQOO for two reasons
One when you see at the budget segment iQOO predominantly in the market only to sell the
But this time what they did is with iQOO Z7 Pro it might
be a rebranded smartphone whatever it is
But in a particular price segment they launched the smartphone with a good processor and also
with good cameras
So in my video most of the people who are asking about the budget segment smartphone
I recommend that one
And to a far extent the software is not refined before
But iQOO 12 they changed it maybe not 100 but at least by 40 or 30
They improved a bit
So thats what I personally feel
What about?
We have to name one huh?
Yeah thats when the fun starts
You can also say none so thats fine
If you dont know
Its not like theres no one
But one thing like Hes making fun of us
Now the thing Im notifying I read a lot of stats and I come to realize
that like inflation like we were talking about in
smartphones so usually the inflation number that the government shares with us which
is 67 but in smartphones in India it was 12
So Im not expecting the smartphone prices to go down in the coming year
Im only expecting them to go high
But at the same time Im also feeling that the smartphones that will come they will
be a little lean
They will not be launching every other month
Their product
They will reduce the portfolio
I feel that way
The question was different by the way
You made me go crazy
Say yes man
I am calculating the percentage right now
I was about to ask him what was the answer
So I am coming to that
One word answer
It should be a one word answer
Explanation later
So for me I think OnePlus Open is a standout device for me
And with that regard its OnePlus for me
Same here
Because one thing is that they have this green line issue
The software issue which has been rapidly happening with a lot of customers
They rectified it and they gave a proper explanation on why
And again with their product range OnePlus 11 and the Open looks very nice
Even the pad is also good
So the one brand that stood out for you is OnePlus?
I cannot stop using the OnePlus Open
Its that good
Also I mean a lot of the
Sometimes a single product can define a whole year
Define a whole year
Because we were all waiting for it as well right?
For OnePlus first foldable
Did it sell?
Im not sure about that
Im not sure about the numbers
From a techies perspective
So Im not sure about the numbers but okay
So two things I liked about the OnePlus Open
The approach of OnePlus towards the Open
One they didnt make it like they launched a foldable for Rs 80000
Its premium
They launched it at a premium price in India
We know that Samsung will launch it for Rs
15 Lakhs
So they also have one for Rs 40000 number one
They didnt play on the price bit
They know that they need to establish that as a premium product
Second thing they went all out with marketing
Go to airports go to premium places youll see Open all around
So okay you cant expect results straight from the first year
But it clearly shows the trajectory ahead
That in the coming years they will be there
And I think it looks good from this point that they will have a certain solid lineup
in the foldables
I mean I wasnt finishing my answer
Its that OnePlus also not just the Open across
Like they refined their lineup or they you know made it better this year with the
Nord CE 3 and the Nord 3
11R I think
11R was a fantastic device
So you know that at every segment theres a OnePlus phone to cater to every audience
So even if you dont like the phone or not as a reviewer people are buying it
I saw so many OnePlus Nord CE 3s its not even funny
Even at airports and the Nord Buds 2R
So popular
So OnePlus is actually getting the audience to acknowledge their devices and buy it
So theyve done a good job
And I think they will continue to do a good job if they continue to keep it this way
And if they could just kind of do a segregation between Open
Just answer my question
Who has improved the most?
Which smartphone brand impressed you in 2023?
OnePlus for sure
For me too I found one thing very interesting in OnePlus this year
Like I tried OnePlus 12
It is all an experiment
I mean all the things like the alert slider they removed it first
Then they put it back on the right side
Now they put it on the left side
And in its software they sometimes put the aperture slider up
So every phone is like full of experiments
And there were a lot of issues with it like the green line issue
But some experiments have been done
Like OnePlus Open was in my opinion a very risky product
Because it would cost Rs 1 lakh
And to launch it at that price
So in my opinion OnePlus showed the guts to experiment and
I would give it to them
Because OnePlus Open is genuinely a good smartphone but it is not there yet
There is no actual proof of concept yet
Which brand is it?
Its the same
Its not there yet
I had two but I have to pick only one
But I would say OnePlus and Motorola
These were the two brands that in my opinion they did very very well
But OnePlus is the winner because of that OnePlus Open
When OnePlus 11 11R all these came and if you see the 10 I mean the ones before
2022 those two years OnePlus launched shit phones
But this year 2023 whether all the series you look at
it whether it is Nord or Nord C or their 11 11R
excellent phones but best thing OnePlus Open
And thats why OnePlus is my brand
I can copy the video of Babar Azam from Pakistan
Theres a video that has gone viral where Rohit Sharma says a long answer in English
And Babar says yes my answer is also same
Yes same same
So OnePlus the reason for that is again was OnePlus 7
Pro or 7T Pro?
It had a popup camera and a curved screen
Both 7 and 7 Pro
That was the last amazing OnePlus
We saw the deviation in 8 9 10
But this year and it clearly showed that was the
beginning 11 11R everything is going well
Nord C Ill give you an example
I was in BITS Pilani Hyderabad campus
I must have taken at least 500700 selfies there
And 80 was using that lime color what color is it?
Lime color
Lime color CE3 light
I mean Im seeing that every other student has CE3 light
CE2 light was the highest setting
I said CE3 light is also going to be the highest
For that matter even Nord 3T light
3T amazing performance good package
Open they have nailed it
So I think acknowledging the faults what went wrong over the years and coming up with
a solid lineup I think OnePlus
And I remember speaking to OnePlus guys in 2022 and they had told me that you look
at 2023 the lineup we have you will change the thought process about OnePlus
So they have done it
Yes sir
So I think everybody has already said quite a few interesting things
You know OnePlus seems to be Wait a minute
Lets score them
IQ got one
OnePlus OnePlus OnePlus OnePlus OnePlus OnePlus OnePlus OnePlus
Why is OnePlus written on the bottle?
But my answer is not OnePlus
So edges are different then
The middle the middle
So acknowledged OnePlus
Motorola you said was fantastic
I think Vivo is another company that is doing some great work
Dont be diplomatic
You only said dont say two and now he said three
Youve already done all this
Its done
But Ill give a very very contradictory answer
Another company that has really impressed me this year is another company that is pushing
innovation at price points that are not possible
They are opening up markets
Its making people imagine and that is techno
I was about to say that
Its a very unusual thing for a company to have the guts to be able to take so many risks
Whether you look at folding phones or flip phones they want to be premium also
They want to bring in things in very different ways
I like the guts of that company and Id love to see what they do in 2024
Because the people who never thought of buying a folding phone at least they still may not
be buying it
I dont know what they are selling
The people who have never bought a folding phone I dont think theyll buy a techno
I bought that
You bought it?
Bro look at its hinge
But I had a poster
Its been a while the hinge is moving
I had a poster
Sales of the folding techno phone
With that techno folding
I saw your video and bought that techno folding
And he was very happy with it
So Im actually surprised
I work with a lot of analysts who only track this
And they track it through various sources including from mobile networks which phone
is latching on
So they have all these numbers instead of just fake numbers from brands
Theyve actually sold very well
And the fold has sold more than their flip
Yeah even I like the Camo series
Yeah that was nice
Okay I think
The last question and I want to close off with
Something very interesting
I mean we all review phones so we get phones to use
But Im pretty sure that were also buying gadgets of our own right?
Im not so sure
I just want to double check that now
Starting from Rajiv whats the best and the worst gadget purchase of 2023 for you?
Best and worst huh?
Best and worst oneone each
So Ill tell you Ill give you a guess
I think everybody has enough time to think about it
So I think I bought
One of my best purchases has been an LG OLED TV
Im very surprised at just how good they are getting this technology and at prices that
I could not even imagine right?
Absolutely fantastic
And because I was in a very big hurry and I was very excited by it because Ive been
using it for years my disappointment one was the new Sony XM5
Its still a great product
Its just that I still feel that the previous generation is better
The overhead ones?
You should have kept it to smartphone
Did you buy it and which one was the worst?
Both have been bought
I said I was in a big hurry so I actually bought it from abroad
My worst
To be honest I cant remember it and I cant highlight it
But the best I know is the DJI Osmo Pocket 3
Amazing cute little camera
Handheld inbuilt gimbal its a oneinch sensor
Comes with a mic thats automatically paired with the camera
Are you using it regularly for content creation?
No so I havent used it much till now
But I think if I have to carry just one camera sometimes you cant carry a big DSLR for vlogging
and stuff
And if you use an iPhone you have to use a rear camera use a wide angle low light
is not that good sometimes
You know it has its own complications
So this small gimbal which you can attach a small tripod it will stay in one place
you know selftracking and all those things
So I think its a good camera
And yeah the best has happened but the worst is not coming to my mind at this time
I have not bought too many things
Honestly only the one I remember and which I think was excellent was the MetaQuest 3
which I got from the UK
We forced you to get it
Perfect correct
Yeah so thats all
I dont have
I havent even purchased the rest yet
I have bought a bedsheet for around 225 lakhs
And what happens in that it is 8sleeve
And the worlds top
Nowadays he has gone into biohacking
Health fitness
We havent talked about that yet
Health fitness of creators
It is a bedsheet that changes the temperature of your body so that your sleep improves
Elon Musk
Top athletes
A lot of billionaires
They all use it
And when you hear it youll think what is he sleeping on?
But that has improved my sleep a lot
And I think sleep is something that has a huge impact on life
So my best purchase so far is the same as of this year
Send me the link
Yes 100
I have a question
Its not sponsored
Does he have an app or not?
I havent used his app much
He has an app
So do you do any preset?
Or you dont have to do anything?
I just set it like that
Im asking the question because I have a lot of trouble getting up
I cant get up
I mean I enjoy sleeping
And my deep sleep becomes very deep
So I thought if he has an app where you can set an alarm kind of thing that at 8 in the
morning you can make it completely cold
Then the eyes will open or something
What does it actually do?
So you can actually its called a silent alarm on this
It vibrates
Vibration is a new term
It does it with temperature
It increases the temperature
Its very slowly
Changes the temperature enough
Its a good thing if there is something like that
If I have 150 alarms on my phone I cant open my eyes
I dont purchase worst things
Say worst ever
If you want to say even if you buy it in 2022
It was worst for us that I bought a RED camera
And I think the whole setup cost me 1015 lakhs
But its so tough to use that we used it in 56 videos
So its worst for us but it can be good for someone
Not fitting in your routine
The workflow
Got it got it
Okay okay
Next Ill tell you
Best I felt I enjoy audio products a lot
I spend the most money on audio products
Like what?
So there is a Sony soundbar
Sony HTA7000 I think
And the surround sound experience that I get from that soundbar
I went crazy
I have it at home
I do it a lot
I enjoy it a lot
With the rear speakers and
Its wireless
The one you picked up for the
The same one you picked up
Same one
So I also have the same one
Same one same one
How much is it for?
I think 12 lakhs
25 lakhs for the whole setup
Rear speakers and the woofer
Okay it has rear speakers too
I can add everything
I can add as many speakers as I want
Crazy experience
White white
I mean Im satisfied
But hes talking about soundbar
If I dont buy the soundbar
No no you can get a soundbar plus those
I thought it only comes as a package with the two speakers
No four speakers and soundbar
You can fit it anywhere
You just have to give power
Sonys naming convention
Coming back to this thing
I think the A9s were the ones with the four speakers setup
And there was the A7000 with the soundbar
Soundbar and
Subwoofer comes with it right?
Subwoofer comes with it
When they said XM5 headphones or earphones
Subwoofer package
But if youre asking about a particular product then
It comes in a bundle
You have to say something
I mean it comes in a bundle
I bought the whole bundle
And Im very happy
Should I talk about the worst?
Its the exact same setup and
How much did it cost?
25 Lakh
The second worst I can recall because as such Im telling you all the time
I just bought it
Recently to make a video I bought a Blackberry passport
Oh God!
Why did you make it?
Dont say that
I used to use it
And it was a very strong phone
Today its experience is bad
Because today
It was from the time of iPhone 6
And I was comparing it side by side
There was so much wrong in it
I was using it at that time
See I used to text
And in that the keypad is all touch sensitive
Youre typing
It used to give you three options in predictive text
One here one here one here
The area where you swipe on the keypad that word will come
And I used it like crazy
Its screen
Its I think
1440 by 1440
Like a square
So today
Its my phone
Thats what I said
Of all time which I bought in 2023 what problem did I face in the keyboard?
That literally they removed the letters and put a space bar in between
That means I have to bring a learning curve
If I have to start using the keyboard then I have to get used to that my space bar will
be in between the letters
Where there should be a B there is a space bar
No problem
And when I saw other things that phone only asks for learning curves
It says first learn how to use it
In that BBOS which has a passport in that if you
swipe to the side at the same place there are WhatsApp threads chatting threads
Facebook threads and email and text
Everything is on one side
But I heard that
It was such an amazing thing
But I heard that APK didnt work
It used to work at that time
It used to work in the beginning
When the transition happened there was a solution by
adding Amazons app store
But only to a certain time
You know what happened to my passport?
Ill tell you my incident story
My passport was
Its a square device
From the bottom it has a sharp edge device
I kept it on the table like this
And it fell like this
This was the distance that it fell
And the screen was
It was worst product
Otherwise it was good
So obviously I also dont buy a lot of tech
I dont have lakhs
But what I picked up recently was a backbone one
Its a controller that you attach to your phone
Im very interested in gaming
So I dont get time to play the PS5
So even in iPhone 15 you can play all the games
I mean Resident Evil is already out there
So I wanted to play that
And a lot of Indies that I wanted to play
So best purchase ever
Because I got a good 50 off
I got it for 5000
I was damn happy
Worst purchase was an audio product
Im an audiophile
So I spend money on audio products
So there was a Fiio FH5
So it was such an impulsive purchase
It was so bass heavy
I didnt like it at all
I dont know what to do
Which one?
Fiio FH5
Its an audiophile
How much is it?
I got it for about 1920 thousand
And this backbone controller?
Is it Bluetooth or you have to connect it?
No its a its like a type C one
So it gets it attaches to your thing
Your phone
Any phone
But he keeps playing that
So yeah
I love it
I have two best
One is just like he said the pocket the pocket 3 DJI
And another one is
TWS which is called Moondrop Space Travel
It costs around like 25 dollars
I think you can import here also 3000 rupees or something
Very good stuff for that price
Worst will be Sony Xperia 1 Mark 5
That phone
The problem He buys a lot of it
The problem with Sony in my experience the last Xperia 1 Mark 1 2 3 4 5 is that they
are having good hardware
But Sony didnt learn computational photography
So camera sensor is good
But when you click photos there was no night mode
Now there is night mode
So what Google Samsung Apple have been doing over the years
Sony didnt latch on to the computational photography
And thats why the photos and videos are very bad
The best purchase is actually we bought a speaker for one of our videos
It was lyric speaker
Whatever you play Hindi English Punjabi anything
It will start the lyrics and lyrics will come in the style
of the mood of the song
And its a really nice thing
And I kept it in my home and I enjoy it
Its a nice motivational starter
Worst actually there will be a lot of worst
Team actually purchases a lot of stuff
They dont tell me the worst
That is for sure
So I am not sure about the worst but that was the best
The storeroom is full of worst products
Yes it is
Alright Tavel
So my best tip would be two things
One is hardware side
I bought a new Insta360 for 360
Just take it in your hand and you can cover everything
You dont have to like for vlogging every time take out the phone or the camera and
You can give the voice over suggestions
Enjoy the moment
That one
And the second thing is software
After paying a lot of amount for Sony Resolve for one time that was the best
decision and
the best software for editing
Worst is a smart ring
I bought it for 10k and it is not worth it
I thought something from abroad
Sleep tracking was not on to the point
Because we used to wear it
The least thing No this was my engagement ring
The least thing That was the best one
Sorry guys I am going to interrupt
Should we do a do a thumbnail I will have to leave
Thank you so much Thank you for coming
This was fantastic
Thank you
Great great
Great initiative
See you
Bye Shlok
Bye bye
Good to see you
We will sit and chat for sure
Lots of hard work
Good to meet you
Nice to meet you
Well catch up again
Nice to see you
Well also sit and chat at some point
Definitely sir
Good meeting up
Best of luck
I wanted to ask this question
How do you guys take care of your health?
So I really want to know
Because 2023 for me I have focused on health like crazy
Because till last year I was just going mad literally working working
But since I started focusing on health it helped me in my work as well
I find myself getting even more free time now
I dont know how
My productivity has increased
What has happened?
My mind is in a better space
But what about your health?
What is your
In my opinion because I have been part of this biohacking community and all
Till now we used to think that we have to live for 6070 years
Its like okay lets live
Well grow old
All the people I have met who are part of this community who are working on top tier
technologies age reversal
A few years from now or the technologies that are still there you can live for 100150
I mean you can live through them
And its not just that youll be able to live
You can live like a 30yearold healthy person
8090 years
And I think
You can have an active lifestyle
And So what youre doing?
Youre doing something like that?
There are a lot of machines
Like it is diet
There are machines
There are technologies
Like for example right now it happens that most people are deficient in something
And as Im doing scientist research Im finding out that everything is because
of a deficiency
If youre not eating properly your pancreas doesnt function properly and you develop
If youre not eating properly eventually you develop cancer
And research has been done clinically proven that if you keep eating certain things throughout
your life you wont develop diabetes you wont develop cancer and you wont get sick
And there are supplements
There are supplements for everything
There are supplements for treatment
I was just looking at it
You were eating so many
How many tablets do you eat?
Tablets are like
It might sound a little weird that I eat 2022 tablets a
But those tablets are like turmeric powder neem powder Okay
Theres some fish oil
So its a very basic supplement type
Theyre not medicines
But they are
Theyre supplements
And theyve developed a lot now
Theyve refined a lot
And the second thing is that there are such technologies that you can use in your body
while exercising naturally
For example theres a body suit
If you wear that and work out for half an hour it is like working out for 4 hours
So if you wear that and do normal work youll basically have a workout session
And theres a machine its called a sculptor
In that there are electrical simulations in the body
So if you put it on your stomach within half an hour you can do around 20000 pushups
And the body basically does this
The body has electrical signals
So the muscles contract and contract and contract
It happens very quickly
And it hurts
But all these things work
Because I did 7 sessions of the sculptor
And my abs got a little better
And Only in 7 sessions?
Yes 7 sessions
But it is painful
We all want to see your abs
But as soon as it comes As soon as it comes first of all for you
But Im getting that moment from the Nayak movie
Im like hes trapped
But it is like an experiment
It might work it might not
So youre doing a lot of biohacking
And health
So youre focusing on that
Yes there are some other people with whom Im connected
And theyre on the same path
Now I think as far as Im concerned I have a lot of faith in science and this
And the output Ive seen for my body its very positive
So Ill do it and see
And well know
Well know
And videos are coming
Yes videos are coming
I did something in between
I saw the thumbnail I didnt see the video
Thats testing
Basically I think its a very simple philosophy
To improve health even in an uneven business the thing you can measure you can improve
So if you take a blood test you can measure vitamin D A B C whatever comes you can
measure everything
Similarly if you measure your lungs your stomach your pancreas you can measure everything
and youll know that these things in your body are bad
And if you track that and keep improving it so
basically your body will also improve
And as it improves you have a biological age which is called the rate of aging
If you live for a year then most people if theyre eating
bad food if theyre not exercising they reduce their age
So after living for a year theyre dragging their lives
for two years
So if you reduce that 05 03 so basically your rate
of aging if you live for a year so basically in that year you only spent three months
So if you live for a year then your one year will end
So you can live for 150 years
A lot of biohacking going on here
And Ill add one more thing to this that sitting in
India we think that all these things are not common
That in 70 years who is tracking and whose abs are there?
But there is a country like this in the world there is a country in Okinawa Japan
There it is common that 8090 years old people have blue zones
Blue zones
And tracking and living a very healthy lifestyle
So this is possible from the beginning
But by breaking it down scientifically yes
scientifically it is being given
And I think this is the future
And people will live for 150 years
But it takes a lot of money now
Okay I have a question for this
So you told me your diet is the main thing right?
So do you prefer foods that are only like raw fruits and veggies that thing?
Or what are the impurities that we usually have in our daily daytoday foods?
Like in flour even in that what do you do with that?
So I have a lot I mean we cant do anything about it
We do what we can
Thats why I am asking
Because you went to Chennai and did all the testings and everything
They can tell you that you eat half a kg of this of
fruits or 100 grams of this
Those things you can
But the impurities in your food which we cant see directly
But it is like do you have any solutions?
Of course in living in this society sitting here we
might have smoked 5 cigarettes
Because this is Delhi
So we cant do anything about that
For that you can shift
Maybe you can shift to Kerala
There the impurities will be less
So that is what I will also do
You are planning to do
He is planning to shift to your city
I am planning
I think to what extent you can go to that depends
For example there is a guy named Brian Johnson
He doesnt leave his house
He cooks his own food
He does everything himself
So what is the use of cooking at home?
But he experiments on himself and does it for us
No I just wanted to know
Because he is the king of biohacking
He understood the whole technology
You come up in farms
You stay where there are a lot of farms
So you must be getting pure
Impurities is all the way
Because even while seeding itself they use the pesticides and everything
They grow the fruits
Do you do any exercises?
And you stay fit like this
No I was not fit
Like when we met 4 or 5 months ago you told me about it
Before when we met in China
After that when I came to Pune
Because thats what I was about to speak actually
Physical health and mental health
Both are big things for creators
So I keep on running in the morning and day
In and out
Because I have to oversee everything
Until you have a good team you have to do everything
Which we usually do for the past 8 years
Then mental health with all the negativities happening around you and a lot of things that
is going around you personally and professionally
So managing these things was my priority this particular year
Going forward it will change
Because after having a lot of discussion and a lot of
I got to take a lot of things in my mind
Kanchit bhai
So I have a lot of perspective about health
Especially creators
What are you doing?
I will tell you what I am doing
I will give context behind it
Shlok told the tech side
I will tell the emotional side
I have this problem that I have to take a lot of stress in the initial days
So stress level increases and stress is also mental obviously
We dont know
We seriously dont know what stress is what anxiety is
what depression is
All three things are different
But we think these are words
But it is not exactly like that
There is a different story behind everything
So I was in stress and I was taking a lot of milk
Obviously it is expensive
After that suddenly I was not able to digest protein
Then there were a lot of proteins like lentils chicken
So I was taking a lot of protein
Then I was taking a lot of milk
Then I was taking a lot of protein
Whatever it is Im not able to do it
All this has happened to me within 3 years
But what was my focus?
YouTube YouTube YouTube
Im busy with YouTube all the time
So that was it
I didnt understand what was happening
to me
I thought a bad phase of life is going on
It will be fine
But then there was a talk going on on the podcast
of BRBicep
I keep listening to the podcast
Manish Pandey probably a lot of people know him
He does a lot for creators
Hes your friend right?
So he once said in a conversation to someone I think Ranveer Alabadia must have said it
that creators dont know what the side effect of YouTube
We have no idea because everything is so new
Some people get hit some dont
I was unlucky that I got hit
So recently I was watching a podcast of Ranveer
Ranveer himself said that he suddenly stopped digesting cheese
I have become lactose intolerant
Maybe Shlok had also said that he stopped digesting milk
I think stress is hitting creators
But we dont realize it
Its hitting in different ways
I think so
But I realized that I have a problem with stress
By the way everything is fine after marriage
So I mean Shlok is happy
Im kidding
Anyway stress management is something
I just found out
Maybe it will work in someones life
The thing I told you
But yes stress management is a process that should be taken in life if you have stress
I learned this
Im doing it
Tell me Gaurav
Your muscles are very real in the middle
I can still see it
I have taken a little break now
But I think if we just follow the basics
Basics means
Do workout
Half an hour one hour
You just walk or go for a jog
Or lift weights or whatever
Basically there has to be a balance
Between your diet
Between your sleep
And your workouts
As long as you have those basics set right
You are going to the gym
You are sweating
You are jogging
And you are sweating
I think it drains all the negative energy
It freshens you up
If you wake up in the morning and do workout
For the rest of the day you are completely charged
You will be charged
Good thoughts will come
You will do the work well
Its a loop
Its a positive loop that you go into
As long as you are maintaining a balance
You are partying for a day in a week
But do you know that the next day
I will have to balance what I ate last night
I am taking out the waste here for two hours
So as long as you have a balance
It should be fine
I am not the person who will be like that in any case
I will lock myself in the house like a normal person
I am not like that
Or for example Shlok did his research
I wont go that extreme
I think as long as I am able to do the basics
Its a good enough thing
And at least to start with
You have to do that
The rest is on top of it
By the way I will share a few things
Because we were talking about this
So I had the same problem
With a lack of some vitamins
You get depressed
I mean if you are deficient in some vitamins
I think there are some vitamins of B For a period of two to three years
You will get depressed
You will get anxiety attacks
And with vitamin D you lose sleep
For example I didnt have any protein left
With the supplementation of B1 and B12
I am able to digest protein well now
So I think
I mean if we look at food a little consciously
I mean its not necessary
You have to take a tablet
Its in nutritional yeast
Its in egg or something
By supplementing all that
If you are eating properly
You can stop depression
Its possible that anxiety attacks
If you can stop all these things
I am saying what happens is
Basically in this creator space
Because of the priorities set towards that
Everything else takes a toll
You wont be able to sleep on time
Eating and drinking will be random
You travel a lot
Because of that the routine is not set
So it gets affected
Whether you see it in a year
Or in two years
Or in five years
Depending on how long your body can tolerate that thing
Sometimes you will get the result
So I think because of the kind of burnouts
You are facing
Or you are too much engrossed into just your
Like creating thing
So I think a balance is necessary for that thing
As long as its balanced
To start with
That should happen
If that doesnt happen
Then its negative will definitely happen
I am seeing the journey
Right in front of you
He has lost something like 15 kgs
Now he is on his way
Yeah so bad eating habits
I mean because
Eating happens due to stress
Eat anything
And never cared about health
I obviously play a lot of cricket
And like you know
We started playing cricket in office
Yeah so I have also ensured
That the whole team on Saturday
Every Saturday we play cricket
Very proper
I couldnt run
And I am like
Like this is not me
Like you know earlier
So I had to like
Take some changes
Make some changes
I didnt start with exercise
I used to only play cricket
But I started intermittent fasting properly
And then I cut sugar from my life
I dont
I dont generally prefer sugar either
But sugar is not required for your body
Very good advice
So its not
Thats the best
Both of us dont eat sugar
I mean additional sugars
But total I mean
And then also like
Protein intake and everything
Thats not been a problem
But cutting carbs
All those basic things
Doing those basic things
Its making a difference
And now I have started
Proper exercising as well
Which is basically walking and running
So its helping
So I was 110
Now I am like
Now I am like 98
I was 110 at one point of time
I was like literally
Into YouTube space
I was like
I was in a very bad mental state
This is common
Bad mental space
Every YouTuber
It reflects into your routine
Thats the problem
You are not in your right mind
You wont be able to sleep
You wont be able to wake up the next day
On time
Your day
So its a loop
Sir this YT creator studio app
Which is showing you in real time
Now 10 views have increased
Now 20 have increased
Depends on how much you are using
Then it is showing comments
Then you know
You are getting feedback in real time
The audience is feeling bad
Feeling good
This is a very stressful thing
Which can happen to anyone
So I did
Went for like a therapy session
With a proper psychologist
That kind of
That was the initial thing
Then after that I Does it help?
Yeah it does
It does help
How many sessions you had?
I had like a proper
Help for you?
But I didnt
I dont believe
For me it works
So its fine
No its about how we perceive it
They will give their input
Based on our
Whatever saying we have
But we need to act accordingly
So it might differ person to person
Yeah that is there
So for me it worked
And after that I decided
I have to reduce my weight
No I heard a dietician
I have a back issue
I have a spine issue
I have a slipped disc
So I cant work out
Or lift heavy stuff
Or run for a very long time
So I have a dietician
Im still following a proper diet
So thats how I reduced it to 98
You are you are slim and trim
So you do something for it
Or it is all natural
Im going to tell you that only
YouTube studio
Or YouTube
The more stats we see on the phone
The more anxiety there is
And sometimes
The game of views is going up and down
So you dont like it
So just before the shoot
You were showing me a video
And I told him
I dont have YouTube
Im watching it on Safari
Because Im detoxing
So the idea is simple
I dont keep all these apps on my phone
Because Im so engrossed in the office
None of the apps are on my phone
So that is one thing that I dont do
Like dont keep it in my phone
I install it
For fitness
So there are various basic things
On which we collectively work throughout the office
From this data Ive got from internet only
That if you walk 10000 steps in a day
So you can stay away from a lot of diseases
So we have
We are doing a step up challenge in our office
So we are 35 people
So 35 people are challenging each other
And everyone has to complete 10000 steps
Every single day
Its tracked on an app
I mean a step up app
It will be tracked on that
And the winners will get exciting prizes
So this is how we are promoting fitness
In our office
We should implement something like this at our office
This app
Because I want
It tracks through just the smartphone
Or it can pair with an Apple watch
Or a fitness band
Or whatever
It can be paired with a fitness band also
Or it can be paired with your phone as well
Because the steps on the phone will be a little inaccurate
Because you either have to keep the phone in the gym
Now theres a catch in that as well
If you do it like this
Then also the step count will be there
But we will give that benefit of doubt
Its up to you
At least if someone is doing it like this with dedication
Then it will be a little more impressive
But yeah
And people
I mean all the team members
They are taking it very positively
And this is one thing we are doing
But slowly and gradually
We will amplify it more
We have just started with walking
Walking is the best exercise
By the way
You had also told in a podcast
I used to walk 30000 steps
4 months straight I did that
And I lost 30 kilos in 4 months
From 105 to 75
You told me this in your podcast
If I open my health app and go to the gym for that duration the rings go around 10 times
2000 calories burn
2500 calories burn just from walking
3 hours 35 hours 4 hours walk
You are always extreme
This is in nature
For me its either best or nothing
As long as I am not doing it or if nothing is involved then its fine
But the day I come in I want to make sure that I take the lead
What a word of thanks
I hope everyone enjoyed the conversation
I am presuming
will be takeaways for everyone
And hopefully we can  do
this next year as well
Thats the idea
This is just the beginning
How much duration did you do?
35 hours
35 to 4 hours
I am getting a lot of blessings from my heart for some editor
2000 to 4000 GB data
The editor is watching the video
Minimum 3000 to 4000 GB data
If there
are 8 cameras and 3 roles
And RAW 3 to 4 TB data
what I am saying
All done
so much
It was fantastic
Thank you crew

Friends lot of viewers keep asking me how to hack someone Facebook account and Gmail account
that also in just one click!
So today please keep watching this video
I will explain how to do it
There is a little twist in it
that how can hacking be done in just one click
So keep watching this videos I will talk more about it
and I hope
I can clear some of your confusions that your have in your head
about one click hacking
lets hope I will clear these confusions
and things will be clearer later
Hello Friends My name is Gaurav and you are watching Technical Guruji
Lets gets started!
Friends I cant understand why
Hacking is so popular?
if I talked to you about Ethical hacking
that is totally different
But I get  messages emails about
How can I hack Facebook?
or hack Gmail?
means the attack is at the personal level
that I want to hack particular persons Facebook account
that also in just one click
If you will Google how to do it
You will get thousands of these websites
You will see a lot of softwares
that will tell you that it is possible in one click
If you search YouTube
you will get a lot of videos where they show you that download one software
Put your ID and password and some of your details
and put ID details of the person who you want to hack
and just press a button
and you get their password You revealed their password!!!
Means there are so many websites that
We think that it is possible to hack in one click!
When we go ahead
and download those softwares
Then we get these surveys
and you can not bypass these surveys
Even if you managed to do it
and you get the file if it exist
If software like this actually exist on a website
you download it
but what happens after you download it?
Can you hack in just one click?
Friends the Reality is this that in one click
Maybe your own account can get hacked
Its not a joke
that at the Facebook or Gmail where
there are a lot of of experts are working
means their expertise is waste?
People think that they have made a one click software to hack and it should work!!
I meanOne should have some sense
But still lot of people keep on thinking about various ways of
hacking in one clickthat
They can hack Facebook  Gmail or Yahoo
It is not possible my friends
On the contrary there are chances
that your own account will get hacked
Either you may keep on going through Surveys
That is also one way
to cheatand to steal your personal details
and you wont get any thing
I agree that you can
bypass some of these surveys by using no script
or by using survey bypass tool
Those are separate toolslets not talk about it
But even if you got a website
they use
Several weird ways like
enter your ID and password
enter your detailsemail
Tell about the person being hacked attach their photo
There are various options provided there
All in all
They just extract your personal information
You wont even realise
You just keep on thinking you will keep on clicking and you will get
the password of that person
In this one click Please dont get hacked yourself
friends all these softwares
all these websites are fake
There is no such way
that works
There has not been and there wont be any either
One click and doneIts just a useless idea
friends I am not saying that
hacking is impossible
There are waysYou can hack accounts
There are several options available
for example Phishing cookie stealing
But there is no such way that can let you
hack in just One Click
Please keep this fact in your headso
You wont waste your time in future
and also you wont get your account hacked in one click
I hope you liked this video my friends
I hope you understood that it is not possible to hack in one click
Please protect yourself
Dont waste your time in stuff like this
and also
It is possible that if you try to do  one click hacking  You will get hacked yourself and then
laughingand then commenting that your ID has been hacked

Their Selfis are Moonlight Selfis
That means they have hired moon for giving light at salary of Rs3000 pm
Do u know these phones have one more great Feature
These phones are Selfi Experts!! Ya Expert!

U go to Indias any corner or any shop
For instance u will not get a AppleNokia or Samsung phone
But u will definately get Hoppo and Viko

Friends all of you often talk about
your laptops computers  mobile phones about the type of processor display  battery
how much storage and RAM it has
and think that increasing RAM and storage will make it great
But here comes the question that we are going to discuss today in this video
that whether increasing the size of RAM has any real practical benefit or should we also take a look at the speed of the RAM
Hello friends my name is Gaurav You are watching Technical Guruji Lets begin
Friends RAM is something which we are able to discuss very easily with our friends
because it is easy to understand like 1GB 2GB  5GB
but if it is a complex term which a common man cant understand then maybe people wont talk about it so much
For example people dont generally talk about the Cache memory because
a common person doesnt know the role of a Cache memory
Now whether it is 2MB Cache or 4MB Cache he doesnt really care
Yes But people understand RAM 1GB 2GB 3GB the more the better
and on the basis of this thinking we keep deciding about the devices
I remember my first android phone  which was Samsung Galaxy S2 it only had 1 GB RAM
There were many phones available in the market below this as well at the time
And now we have 23456 and now we even hear the rumors that upcoming phone will be 8GB RAM 16GB RAM
And all we are focusing on is to increase this number further But have you ever thought
whether we practically need this much RAM or not?
Suppose today if you want to build a PC at home to play games 8 GB RAM is all you need All the games work smoothly on that
But as we are always looking for the best so despite it costing more
we will go for 32 GB RAM 64 GB RAM
does the RAM whether 8GB or 32 GB play any role in the performance of the game?
Not really
So guys there is a thing called RAM capacity
Suppose I am the processor and the table is the RAM and whatever I am working on I have already called it here
Everything else is stored in the cupboard which is actually the Hard Drive
Now suppose if this table was very large still my hands can reach this space only
so only this RAM is of my use
Or if suppose the jobs at my hand are small enough to fit this space then I dont really need a table that big
So after a limit the remaining RAM is a waste and you are not really able to use that resource
but if suppose this table starts throwing object that I need in the job towards me so that I am able to work with more speed
that is in simple language the RAM has become fast
the data transfer between the RAM and Processor is taking place faster
so this will be beneficial to you instead of just increasing the size of the table again and again
4681525  people keep on increasing RAM and then think that their device is faster
So here we need to think a bit practically I understand that the table RAM is sufficient for you today
but it might not be enough in 2 years time with improvement in the softwares
I understand that after sometime you need to upgrade your phone or PC whatever it is  but we need to see where we are getting the best value currently
You need to see the specifications of the RAM How many Mega Hertz is its speed whether DDR3 stick is used or DDR4 stick is used
Whether your phone has DDR3 RAM or DDR4 RAM or what does your processor supports best where you will get the best optimization
We sometimes ignore these things and just keep running behind MORE
Bro! I am using 64 GB RAM
For what purpose? Games
You could have played the same game on 8GB RAM as well
These are few things that we need to keep in mind
You can tell me in the comment section below about your views on this blind race
I mean we dont even know the finish point of this race We dont even know why are we in this race But we are just running behind the numbers
The same thing goes with the storage
People say  I have a hard drive of 2TB
Now if same person is told that I have a Solid State Drive SSD of 256 GB
capacity is less than Hard Drive but performance is many times better then he might not be able to understand it
so here we need to have these things in mind that not only we choose the best possible technology for ourselves but also understand why are we choosing it
Friends you can tell me about any such experiences you have had faced with any friend or with some relative
where they were fighting over the numbers
I hope you liked this video
Dont forget to comment any suggestions that you have

As I keep bringing such videos to you daily
How much money did you pay there? I gave 50000 rupees Sir  50000 rupees! Yes Sir
Rahul Manan is only concerned about his money okay  I have understood this after purchasing his course
What happened I watched the entire course till the end and everything is implemented from A to Z still failed
When I went to watch his course the comment section there was also filled with abuses
There was no place left Weather its YouTube Google Twitter Instagram Facebook Comments
Where people are not feeling cheated by buying this course
That we paid this money  and there is no value in that course
Earlier too there have been complaints  about these fake gurus
That they sell courses in the name of money making
Amit Parekh Rahul Manan Dev Gadhvi and now Vivek Bindra
Where Sandeep Maheshwari jis video people complained that they were sold a course and there was no value in it
The amazing thing is that  this is spread across the world
But in India it is the highest
You know the net worth of elearning and online courses was 190 billion dollars in 2018
And now it is estimated that by 2029  it will be 319 billion dollars
Amazing thing is that 32 of the websites  on Google are selling only online courses
Every sixthseventh video on YouTube  is promoting only make money online courses
amazing thing is that in India People are becoming rich by telling them how to become rich
Are these the courses of money making gurus
Or 10 day MBA  courses to make you a businessman?
Is this course fake?  Is it a lie?
No this is not fake or lie
But this is a Generic course
You are getting the same knowledge the same knowledge or sometimes even better for free on the internet on YouTube
Without telling you this  they are giving it to you in the name of the course
Then how does a person with normal IQ buy this course?
How does one get stuck?
How they manipulate?
The most amazing thing comes in this  similar to what astrologers
First one is the Thirst Trap
Which means that a person is already hungry  to become rich
They target a common problem of humans  and trigger it a little
Like Lets say youre stuck in a 9 to 5 job
But you cant buy a car
Being in a Job Im sure Its Going to Be Very Hard for You to Make a Lot of Money Which Can Help You to Drive the Car Like This
Or you want to earn money sitting  there is no need to work
Or you want to become rich like me
Because Gen Z feels that one day they will definitely become rich
Or the biggest Amazing thing  that they say that I was very poor I had nothing
Now I have lakhs of rupees
Meaning the financial conditions of the house were very bad to spend and as you can see now 12 Pro Max is kept
Hearing this anyone thinks man  he was poor and became so rich
Everyone wants to become rich and from here
And from here that small holding awakens in their mind
Where little by little they start taking interest in it
And Seconds here they trap  Booby Trap
Which they show as show of life style
Here they show that I have this car this is a sports car I keep roaming around I have a bungalow
This live traveling the world I am in Dubai right now living in the five stars seven stars
They also show a fake account that I have so much balance in my account I go in a private jet
Malaysian influencer took a jet on rent  to show off how much money I make
Similarly expensive clothes  expensive purses
Create a confirmation bias around you
That yes this man is earning
Then they use such words to sell their course
10 day MBA financial independent or big words of strange things
That he has acquired amazing knowledge
Create very impressive ads
Only shows wealth
Like iPhone company does  like the company of Rolex does
They show their product only with a rich look  that it is not for the poor
If you are poor and want to be like us
Then they create such an ad what a lifestyle
That ad is run everywhere
On Facebook YouTube Instagram
Where they give you a catchy line  and make you click on the learn more option
Below if you want to become rich  you were poor like me click on Learn More
Here your convincing mode starts on
But here your cognitive thinking is working now
Where you know that it can be fake
They want to sell their course  just want to earn money from us
But this guru also knows this
To break your cognitive thinking  they use a word Free
Where they say that we are offering a free session
I have created an absolutely free training for you
By attending a free training you too can earn Rs 7 to 10 thousand per day within the next 30 days
I am giving a free webinar or we are giving the registration for free for 10 days for 15 days
It will not be free after that
They cash the free word in such a way that
Your cognitive thinking gets broken
You think that it is being given for free  so whats the problem
Right?  Whats the problem with going and seeing?
So the earlier traps worked
Here you register for their webinar
That you are getting it for free  there is no problem in Free
And my dear Nothing is available for free in this world
If something is being sold to you for free
Then by making a product you will be sold
Third after registering  you reached their free webinar
The main purpose of calling here is
That the ad you were seeing was very short  30 seconds 1 minute long
Where it was not possible to convince
Now they will keep you here for one or one and a half hour
And will create an echo chamber for you  will create a bandwagon effect
Where all the psychology was used to convince you
And here they will tell first of all
How have I earned what I have earned?
I have written a book  these are the proofs of my account
What he told in the video  he will explains in detail
This is my car this is my net worth  earlier I used to live there earlier I was poor
And to prove this many popular faces  will also be brought before you
Which are obviously paid
Where paid TEDx interviews will also be shown  their sessions will be shown
You will get podcasts and videos  with popular young people
By including everyone such an echo chamber  has been created in front of you
You will feel that this cannot be a lie
5040 of them are convinced to buy the course from there that we should buy
If they are not then they then target individual people
In the fourth step  where India comes
Most of the people in India buy these courses
Convince their parents or tell the parents that your son is poor his life will become better
Or convince that son
Why do these people become convinced in India?
Because two things are special in India
That it has the highest population in the world
Secondly the education rate here  the children of tier 2 and tier 3 are around 12 pass
And they are not getting jobs but they Want to become rich
And thirdly here is the US education system
Which only prepares you for job not for business
In such a situation everyone runs in the same race
So not everyone gets a job only one or two get it
In such a situation unemployment is very high here  the numbers are very high
It is very easy to manipulate such people
They create their courses on trending topics
Most of the people buy their courses
Now after purchasing the course people realize
That there was no value in it
The things mentioned in it are not lies  they are not wrong
But it is not even worth the amount given
If you learn that course  you will feel that I am not learning anything special
What you are claiming  what this course claims does not hold true at all
I would not recommend even a single person  who is watching this video to buy this course
In fact the guy is not even getting extra support
That give us some support to make us understand this no?
Now they say that the more hard you work  the more money you will earn you will have to work hard
And people feel that  We are not the only ones earning from this course
Because 1 or 2 people are earning
I dont know whether they are earning or not  they just do advertisements
So the person feels that maybe  I am not able to work that hard
But no one raises questions on the course
That there could be a problem in the course
Now tell me that if 100 pots have been planted  by some gardener
And one or two pots bloomed and 98 pots died
Then it would be the gardeners fault right?
The gardener blames the plants for not working hard  these two had also blossomed
Now those who have bought the course get selfblaming
And they dont say anything  or there are some who do not know where to speak
There are children of class 1012  where should they go?
Here they raise the same question that we are not earning from the course
Then they say no problem  those who are not earning from this 3000 course
We have another upgraded version on top of this  that is for  10000
You buy that it will make you money
Then people think maybe I will learn from there
So he buys a course worth Rs 10 thousand  but he doesnt know from there
So I thought I have come this far so lets try this course once and see if I can get success
Then they say buy it for 30 buy it for lakhs
Some people buy some people run away  some people leave
In the end there is a very good solution left for them
That if you do not learn business from our business course MBA course
Then do one thing this course we have created
You sell it to people we will give you commission
The money you paid for the course will be recovered to you
If you come here you will definitely learn the business
And you know what happens at the place of business
They do it so that their product gets sold
Sell their products nothing else is happening
You are saying that you took that course after taking which you realized that there was no point in it but
Now they told you that now sell the course further  you will get so much money
You will get this much money
And for that also they give training  that you go in front of the school and tell the children
You go to their parents tell them
How to sell their course  they also give separate training for this
And it starts like an MLM business
So if you want to recover your money?
Weve fooled you so if you want your money back?
So you fool people too
Only then you can get money
And this loop keeps on going on and on
There is no legal complaint about it
Because the children of 10th12th do not even know  how to make a legal complaint
Legal complaint cannot be made properly
Because what is mentioned in the course
There is nothing false  nothing wrong in that course
But it is generic and there is no refund policy
Whereas a legal complaint can be made
Well that will be done as a group  and with time it has happened and will also happen
But let me tell you one thing clear
Any number of courses on YouTube
Like how to grow a YouTube channel?
I provide Indias number 1 course on YouTube  I say this out of fear
Or How to become a businessman?  Or how to earn money?
Or whatever type of training courses are given
I am guaranteed that all of them are available for free on the internet and on YouTube
You dont have to pay money to anyone to get any course any knowledge
You will find it if you search properly
Wherever this course is being sold  it will be a generic course
Snd there is no value in it
And the amazing thing is that all the top businessmen
They didnt even do any courses or degrees
Steve Jobs did not do any course degree
Zuckerberg Bill Gates Richard Bedson or Henry Ford
And there are an infinite number  who never did a course or degree
And the irony its amazing
That people are earning money by telling  how to earn money wow!
If you are going to buy any kind of course on YouTube
Leave aside lakh thousand 500
Even if you are buying a course worth Rs 50 right?
Aa Thu
Friends this is the
First Class in Emirates
Friends our tickets have been upgraded to the First Class
The lounges are up ahead
and theres even a gym here
A gym in the airport!
This one?
I thought it was that one
Fast Lane
Is this your fast lane pass?
Fast Lane pass ready!
Our gate is at C
they told us itd take half an hour to reach there by walking
This airport is so huge that
you can walk for half an hour in it
all within the same building
This is the poster of Spirit of Dubai
But this woman in the painting
seems to be carrying the Indian flag
Quite an international painting
People of all kinds
And even some Mongolian army
And were at their First Class Lounge
And the Business Class Lounge is on the other side
So actually we were rejected from the First Class Lounge
because they said that the upgrades
do not include access to the Lounge
Even though our seats got upgraded
the upgrade doesnt allow us to go to the Lounge
So were not fully in First Class
Were actually half a class
Such an insult
Theres a golden palm tree at the airport
Look at those gold bars
No youre doing it to the Business Class
you need to do it to the
This is a Boeing 777 plane
Airbus A380 is better than this
Because that has 2 floors
This is the same
Id say that this is the second best
Whats our seat?
Wow theres so much space!
I dont see any place to store the bags above us
Theyve even provided us slippers
It literally feels like a room you know?
Like you booked a hotel room or something
Theyve kept flowers there
Oh yeah?
Once you close this and that one
well kind of have our own little cave
There are so many mirrors here
The one that you can see here is the TV
The real mirror is here
in case you need to put on makeup
Theres a mirror at the side behind the lamp
Theres a mirror at the bar
so that you can check out the drinks stored here
Theres a mirror at the back too
The seat is less of a seat
and more of a mirror maze
And weve taken off
Most of the seats in the First Class are empty
If I zoom in a lot
I can see the Burj Khalifa
See there it is
Let me reduce the brightness a bit
They have an accurate map here
Look at how fast the plane is flying
The seat belt sign has been turned off
let me take out the tripod
so that I can show you everything properly
By pushing this button
this door closes
Now that the doors have closed
this has turned into a room of sorts
No one can peek in from the outside
because the doors are quite tall
And theres a barrier between me and Juli as well
This one
By raising this one this will become a proper room
Do you see how high these are?
From both sides
The only thing missing is a roof on top
But theres no roof
Its just empty space above us
Above this height
and above this height here
So if I stand up
I can easily peek in
Even so as I told you theres a lot of privacy
Let me open this one
Because theres some nice light here
Pull Here To Open
Since this isnt allowing me to pull
well have to push the button
And now lets take a look at the menu
The menu here is so good
Therere so many dishes for you
And such posh dishes
Like see this one
Honey Roasted Pumpkin with Thyme
Pan Fried King Oyster Mushroom
I will order this dish
And dont be misled with the word Oyster
this is a vegan dish
Oyster Mushroom is a type of mushroom
Not oyster
Awardwinning triple cream blue cheese from Germany
Well that is fancy
Premium aged Dutch gouda
Handmade red
How do you pronounce that?
Juli has already made her bed here
Actually theyve even provided mattresses here
So you can take out the mattress
before you lie down
and there are pillows obviously
And a blanket as well
You can see how spacious this is when you look from above
Look how much space I have to spread out
My feet are still not reaching the end
Theres so much extra space in here
So do you wanna work on something?
Or write down any ideas?
Just press that thing there
What thing?
This board
This? Yeah
This one? Yeah
They gave you a whole notebook
With an Emirates plane
Im gonna work Work on the next video ideas?
Weve closed both doors here
Juli is going to sleep
and no one will come to disturb us
so I think this is the best time
do the most exciting thing
Whats the most exciting thing?
The various buttons that we have here
and the different secret compartments
lets explore those
First of all here
This opens and closes the door
With this the table tray comes out
And this makes the bed
So lets turn this seat into a bed
Look at the width of this bed
I have big hands
I span 15 cm approximately
so I think the bed is 45cm50cm wide
The blanket is here
theres the mattress
Juli has already laid down her mattress
Apart from this theres a small iPad here
this controls the TV screen
And theres a compartment here
You can store your phone here
Right above it are these buttons
that moves this barrier
What is this thing?
This looks like a fan of sorts
I dont know which button turns this on
And with the buttons here
these lights can be turned on and off
This button controls the brightness of the lights
You can control the brightness as well
There are so many settings here
What happened? What did this open?
Oh I got it this basically
is pressed to bring out this iPad
and this button locks it
There are two more buttons
Lets press them and see what happens
Oh wow its ascending in style
This drinks area moves up a bit by pressing this
And pressing it again send it back
Whats this thing?
So big
This is so huge
That was some quality sleep here
Since this bed is so spacious
Sleeping normally on your back
though it is possible in business class
but you cant move from one side to the other
You have to sleep straight on your back
But theres so much space here
you can sleep on your sides
and even fold your legs and sleep
You can do it all
It is so spacious
And the mattress that theyve provided
this is so comfortable
Foods about to come
Lets see how the food will be
Im watching the movie
Bunty and Babli 2
I havent watched it before
Even the screens so big
This is their Mango Avacado Salad
And this is the first course
Friends the main course has arrived
This main dish looks like a meat dish
but these are oyster mushrooms
A seasonal salad with it
and the pumpkin side dish
And a delicious feast is ready here
Friends can you see this?
This is unbelievably good
After experiencing luxury at this level
the only point of concern is that
whenever we travel next
how will any experience match up to this?
Well be disappointed
So after I made the video on cold drinks
you might wonder what I drink since I dont drink cold drinks
other than drinking water
Ive ordered a virgin mojito here
A virgin mojito contains water and lime juice
and sugar
If you reduce the amount of sugar in it
to relatively theres nothing harmful in it
Like this one has little to no sugar
Very little sugar
If you want to drink this
keep in mind that normally
virgin mojito contains a lot of sugar
but if you drink it with only a little sugar
Normally they make it with soft drink
Pour some soft drink then lime juice and mint
This one hardly has any if any
sugar or soft drink
so its more like sparkling water
with lime juice and mint
And its extremely refreshing
Even the bread basket was special here
When I took out a bread from here it turned out to be garlic bread
See the garlic stuffing in it
Another big difference
are the headphones you get
Look at these they look so high quality
And everyone gets a snack basket
And it has everything
It has some nuts some trail mix
gummy bears
Chocolate of which I already ate a piece
And some vegetable chips
Lets see whats going on here
Oh they booked the VIP package
Lets stick to work
Theres a hilarious scene in the movie
When the BuntyBabli song plays
So they say MashaAllah in the song
and the subtitles write it as Hallelujah
Wait youll see now
Its interesting to read the subtitles
To see how things have been translated
sometimes the translations are really weird
There are some things that Ive still not understood
What are they actually?
There are always some undecipherable things
Like this one over here
It seems like a speaker
But whats the purpose of having a speaker?
For announcements?
If you look at the quality of the things
in comparison to the normal seats or business class seats
theyre of high quality
Theyre a fabric layer here
this isnt just plastic
Its real gold
This is real gold?
That would be too much
Another interesting thing here
this is a light
thats normal
But this is the AC vent
Ive finally figured out how to turn it on
It turns on like this
and blows so much air
you can literally dry your hair
If you look at the bottom here
theres a charger here
you can close this
Another USB charger here
And a belt that you can pull out
I think the purpose of this belt is different
Because theres another belt lower than the first
And I think both belts can be attached there
and keep the bags secure
in case the bags are moving about
Talking about the corner spaces
theres a corner space here
what have they put there?
This is a small compartment
I might just be an empty space
And the magazines and headphones were placed here
These two doors thats actually one door
the blinds point down
We can look down from the inside
but someone outside at eye level wont be able to look inside
This is the first seat where you can fold your legs and sit
Whenever I watch a film
I regret it because
On this flight of 56 hours
I feel like watching a movie here is a waste of time
That Im missing out on a chance to enjoy
Each minute spent on this seat
should be fully enjoyed
not wasted by watching a movie
Thats what Im feeling repeatedly
This is another unique angle here
Im showing you the seat from all angles
so that you get the best idea
steady got it good
oh my goodness look at this the entire
tech mafia meetup who do we have here
its big dom
there he is we got john or two youre
not so average consumer oh gosh
sensitive the only mr line is tech tips

hardware on this phone the speakers are
great the cameras great i legitimately
really do enjoy face id this is like the
best hardware ive ever tried on a
smartphone like i love the pixel 2
but im excited okay hey man this is
your moment like im not going to
interrupt you you make your case right
that doesnt bother me theres so little
that i dont like about this phone do
you consider yourself to just be an ios
guy like its going to be hard to break
away from thats not it so what was the
last android device you used extensively
that was
its like my main phone yeah
okay so thats your theres your answer
theres your answer all right moving on
who wants to be next thrown in the fire
into the flames of the tech world its
linus tech tips hi how many videos did
you make a ces 45 45 videos round of
applause everybody
who is this man
and what is he made of
which smartphone is in your pocket and
why so im on the pixel 2 xl my galaxy
s8 something i have installed on it is
making the battery drain really fast i
havent had the time to deal with it are
you trying to say you preferred it is
that on my trip i actually have five
phones with me i can give you the
reasons for all of them this one im on
because i popped the sim out of the mate
10 pro there was some software that
wasnt installed on it i needed to use
so i put my sim in here you sound like
the most reluctant pixel user ive ever
heard in my life
its okay oh so youre not a big fan of
it yeah
round roblox
its good its really good i love the
i havent used a phone for longer than a
month at a time in over half a year part
of my deal is i switched the eight i was
using the a plus the pixel 2 not the xl
this was the last one i was on before i
switched to the razer phone which i
frankly didnt like that much so the sim
went back in this one if you could put
any one of them in your pocket not not
the most convenient at that moment which
one would it be im really happy with
this one okay so what is this one
sort of
look at these hands i cant handle this
much phone
so really what i want is the s8 back but
with not my batteries how about this in
the form factor of just the pixels yeah
thatd be fine yeah i like this watch
better than i like my phone
i want to be fed to the lines next
if were talking pixel then were
talking me a pixel 2 xl and if you guys
have been following me in this recent
trip how about this view ive taken
pictures of this view and i truly
believe this is the best camera on a
smartphone right now period i have not
taken a bad picture with this phone plus
i like stock android and all the usual
things that you know about this is in my
pocket for now theres no lies here it
either is or it isnt
all right whos next
judner youre next man the pressures on
iphone 10 wow its just two phones so
far im gonna be straight up its
imessage man in the ecosystem whoa
thats what it is for me i dont even
know what this means this imessage thing
its not about the blue and green okay
what is it about im always on my
computer always on the phone somebody
hits me up usually its a family member
whos also on imessage i get it wherever
i am yeah i mean you could do the whole
haircut a lot of things
some other messenger you know a lot of
the world they use whatsapp for example
yeah i mean ive got that comment a lot
yeah but its like okay
i gotta tell you go download something
what would it take for you to switch
over i message on android honestly i
mean thats not gonna happen obviously
but yeah what are we sitting at right
now three to two oh
cant wait a hotly anticipated take from
the man himself mkbhd what did you have
you had a smartphone awards uh the best
phone the best this the best that it was
a lot of bests but i think what the
people really want to know is whats in
the pocket whats in the pocket and why
which pocket first of all because i do
firing back right now you have two
phones yes main sim card the number you
have this phone number pixel 2 xl naked
pixel 2 xl panda the colored power
button stock android great camera all
the same reasons you said fingerprint
reader is in a good spot i have big
hands so i couldnt even use the smaller
version of this phone im a big phone
person if theres an xl thats where im
going but the other pocket i do carry an
iphone oh can you believe this are you
running for president next there are
things that just work better on ios i
use the best iphone i can i use my
favorite android phone wow this diplomat
right here came prepared pick a damn
phone right now if you had to drop one
is that it im dropping the iphone yes
there it is there it is
no cop out in here no compounds in here
i dont like this whispering
collusion just two phones in the whole
room what are we sitting at now three
three tie breaker happening now mister
whos the boss whats happening
so no preamble no banter i came from the
note8 i couldnt stand it because of the
battery and pixel 2 the great the screen
is not fantastic
you kind of get used to it show someone
a meme they might comment on this like
blueness but its not terrible the pixel
the pixel is better in every way 4 3
pixel 2 xl to iphone 10 i got gotta be
honest im a little disappointed that it
broke down that simply theres a lot of
amazing phones out there maybe this says
something about us maybe were a little
too predictable maybe we need to get out
there a little more often im not really
sure this has been incredible this is
unprecedented i dont know maybe you
want to see something like this next
year you people there in the audience if
you do i think you know what to do you
use your thumb to let jack know that
thats the case i want to say thank you
