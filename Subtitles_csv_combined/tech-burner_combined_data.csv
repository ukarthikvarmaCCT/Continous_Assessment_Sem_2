Today I went to Tech Burners studio
Bro the studio is so big that   we had to use hoverboard here
to go from one side to another
Then on the way I saw Tech   Burners 5 lakh rupees dog
It had a camera in its nose
It had too many  sensors in the mouth
And brother it was showing   it by doing different tricks
And this is the first dog in my life
whom I slapped and it  did not bite me poor dog
Then I saw this red camera   which is usually used in movies
To lift it first I had to make   body with dumbbells
because it was too heavy
Even its price was equally heavy
Rs65 lakh
And this 100TB server was to   keep the big footage of this
Then I did the first collab of my life   with Tech Burner
Overall I learned a lot   and had a lot of fun
One more thing is too fun

How much can you make a business with Layers?
We can make millions
As a creator there are many ways to earn money
We should know what we shouldnt do
I think that technology is coming
I dont want to tell you
Please cut this part
Am I fake?
Am I pretending?
Today we have a creator with us
Who you know for technology
But I think of him as a good businessman
Normally we hear that to make a business
We should have an idea
Then we make a business and do marketing
But he has reversed this wheel
First he created a distribution
Then he is making a business
And I think he is making a business in a very smart way
In some places I am having a problem
I think I should ask questions
So we will ask questions
Lets know about him
Hello friends I am Shlok Srivastav
We are making tech videos
We have been making videos for 10 years
And along with that
I have a passion
In every person
I also have a passion for design and aesthetics
I always wanted to make something
In which I can put my love
If it reaches the audience through physical products
It will be great
So we have built a clothing brand
And a mobile accessories brand
Apart from that
We have executed a lot of social media and marketing
In the last 67 years
It has been an insightful and interesting journey
We have done a lot of big launches
The next few years are definitely going to be very strong
I dont know how to praise myself
You are doing very well
Tell me
When you started the YouTube channel
Did you decide to launch a product?
Or was it a journey as a creator?
While doing it
When you got the audience
Did you think of selling something?
As a creator
There are a lot of ways to earn money
Because you have a lot of things
You can do marketing for a company
Like there are so many companies
You can help them in marketing
We have also built applications
We have built different things
And I have noticed that
There is a different game everywhere
Making a product is a different game
Our main goal was to inspire
Because I saw a problem
In India
There is no shortage of resources
Its not like we make so much food
That we feed the whole population 3 times
So I faced a problem with the mindset
So my goal was
To make something different
Something strong
Something that creates a movement
And we tried that
With layers
That product was not successful before
And that product was not in the market
No one knew what skins were
There were few people who knew
But apart from that we created the market
So when that emotion
Gets attached to a project
I think it propels it
Same with clothes
I saw that all the clothes in India
Are being sold by international brands
And Indian brands are selling it cheap
Some are selling it for 200 rupees
Some are selling it for 500 rupees
We are cutting the price
No one is making such expensive clothes
So we tried to solve that problem
It took us a long time to solve that problem
It took us 3 years to make clothes
To make such clothes
That are dealing with international brands
It took us 3 years to make the same skins
To install the factory
To set up the manufacturing
To see the operations
The technologies that are used for that
I think
We have to make money
Business can run only with money
If there is no money
Then what is business
I dont believe in that
I think if we want to make something big
Internationally We need money
But the goal was to create a movement
I think we have done that
To some extent
But now the goal is
To take the Indian brand
To an international level
I have thought about it
If you count on your hands
Like we were asking you
There are so many brands that are selling Indian brands
We cant count on our fingers
We dont even know the brands that are selling outside India
And there are very few brands
So I think someone has to break the barrier
Someone has to make international business from India
So we
Go into that risky area
And do things
Now its a stove
So one thing I wanted to ask
Which is honest
You have worked on your personal branding
Because I think
I have seen this constantly
I am from a marketing background
So I notice small things
What I noticed
When we talked
There was a fire in the message
Some of your keywords
Like we were talking normally
We were talking like this
And when we make videos
We talk like this
We will do this
Did this happen naturally
Or did it take time
Because if I watch old English videos
At that time
Body language
And as we are transitioning to recent
There is a difference in our body language
We have changed a lot to make a relation with our audience
This is honest
Yes 100
Like a person
I have thought a lot about this
Am I pretending
And what happens is
I have seen myself
Like every person has a different style
When he is going to meet girls
He becomes sweet
When he is going to meet his brothers
He has a different vibe
Like this
Same person
If he is talking to kids
And if he is talking to his friends
He becomes sad
So I saw that
I used to try to talk sophisticated
Professionally In my college
Then I thought
My friends are coming
After that
I felt uncomfortable in English
Because our mindset is like this
When do we speak English
We have to speak formally
It becomes a habit
Hindi becomes a comfort
So I imagined
My friends are sitting behind
I am talking to them
Like when we were talking before
I was a business owner
To a business owner
But now I know
Many young entrepreneurs are watching this
So I want
They should also
Feel the same
Thats why I change a little
So who is your audience
If you imagine
What is their age
Where do they live
Where are they studying
So I imagined my audience
When I started
I imagined my age
Because they are the same type
Who are doing everything
In the beginning
Guys who are interested in tech
Because usually 5 of the guys are interested in tech
This is the start of YouTube
Majorly 16 to 24 years old guys
Who are studying engineering
Those who are studying coding
Engineering That is my audience
Engineers are interested in technology
They attract them
If you see anything
They get attracted
So I took my audience
And I was not deciding
Now it is different
You will be able to notice
My way of speaking changes
The way of speaking changes
The way of showing things visually changes
On Instagram
There are a lot of girls on Instagram
There are a lot of people on Instagram
Who follow for fashion
There is a different vibe on Instagram
The audience is very different
People on YouTube know about tech
Let me give you an example
Recently I go out less
I went to the bank
I had to do KYC
I have to go there
I had to change my account
I saw a girl
She said hi
I watch your videos
Age Reversal
I uploaded this video 2 years ago
I was confused
She said
I asked where did you see
By chance we cut the clip
And uploaded it on Facebook
She did not know about our long form video
She did not know about tech
She knew that we upload short clips
She just saw our video on Facebook
You will not believe
In our audience
There are only a few Indian cities
There are cities of Bangladesh
There are a few cities outside India
There are a few cities of US
There are a few cities of Canada
I did not know
Every platform
There is a different audience
And now it has become so different
That everyone has to treat it differently
So there is a different type of content for everyone
We are not able to optimize for everyone
I try to make content that
Can cater to everyone
Now what happened?
You grew your channel
It became a base
People were knowing
Your demographic was clear
A 1624 year old kid
You made a product around his needs
The first product was Layers
I am also a Layers
Your audience
I will tell you
When I was doing engineering
I had a Micromax
A116 Micromax was not a good brand
I did not like Micromax
I used skin
Just to hide the Micromesh
At that time all the phones looked the same
The phones were sold on screen size
Today there is a lot of trend
At that time screen size was a big issue
It was a big phone
Micromesh canvas
If I had put a skin on the back my Micromesh would have
been hidden
So my target
If I think why I used the skin
To hide the Micromesh
If we talk about today
The phones become prominent
So according to me most people
Dont use the skin
If I try to think demographically
Then you tell me
Because I want to know your point of view
I am trying to think
Who buys
One people
Who like to keep their phones naked
Without cases
And they want scratches on their phones
Second people
Who want to show their phones as a trend
Because now a days most of the phones come in white plain
They want something
Or They want to express their emotions
There is one audience
Who wants to show
I am like this
So basically they are expressing their emotions
If I say third audience
I will say
They are resembling a community
If I talk about my brother
My brother
Brought a roll from Gafar market
He has
A 3D printer
He has a CNC printer
So now a days
Models are available online
Of every phone case
So he goes to buy a new phone
He gets the exact same sheet
Printed and put it on his phone
So whenever his phone changes
And he changes his phone a lot
Every 3 months
His back will always be the same
Technology will change camera will change
But the look and feel of the phone
Will always be the same
I use my phone
So that I always remember
If someone keeps their phone aside
I always remember my phone
That is his mindset
So I am able to think of these 3 people
You tell me what you thought
I was not able to define
It was a mistake
And I was not able to define it
Because at that time
It was not a must to adopt it
After this product
The audience we wanted to sell
I wanted to sell
It was not well known
There were very few skin men
Delhi Mumbai
Nehru Place Gafar
You used to get skin in Gafar
And they used to cut it off with a blade
They used to cut it off
With a blade
They used to scratch it
The problem was
It did not glow
I felt that the quality of the skin
Was not that good
And the design was not that good
So we worked hard
To add texture
And no one was able to copy it
Because the set up was worth crores
If I break down the layers of the business
We removed the need
That this is not a need driven business
There is no need for this product in the market
It is not that
No one wants skin
It is a humanity driven
Or emotional purchase
Who wants to purchase it?
It makes me feel good
I love the design and texture
It saves from scratches
It provides protection
But the primary reason
Is that you feel
That you are a part of a community
That is the primary
Need of
Belonging I feel good
Like college students
Represent themselves
For example
We wear clothes
Like Gucci
Or I wear a watch
It solves a functional purpose
Like logo or watch
It is the same watch
It tells me the time
It is not a functional product
It is an emotional purchase
In my opinion
Emotional purchase is a good thing
Because people say
Dont spend money
Why not?
Everything is so
Emotionally driven
Let me give you an example 22 boys
Are hitting the ball with a stick
And a country of 1 billion
Is watching them
Everyone is happy
Everyone is shouting
The whole country is sad
That they couldnt hit with a stick
There is no purpose
There is no logic
Everything is emotional
If we break down
What is logical 90 of the things we do
Are emotionally driven
There is no lack of resources
There is a lack of mindset
The same mindset
And the same
If you go to India
To meet rich people
I go to clubs
Do you know what kind of people
I meet?
I make henna oil
I make a tyre cover
I make a machine
To clean the road
I make the threads
And what will happen?
Profit will be 800 crores
Profit will be 600 crores
In India the same business
But I think
From today
The time of internet
From now
Vanity and emotional businesses
Will be successful
Distribution was created
If we talk about a normal brand
They also have to sell their skin
Because everyone has money
A person can install a machine
Can bring the same technology
Distribution can also come in India
Distribution will be on every sale
Today I researched 6070 traffic
Is coming on your website
Because of Shlok
Shlok has generated a lot of business
But today
If a new brand comes
They have to make their own brand
Maybe they run a ppc campaign
When someone searches skin
Or layer
They have to take a lot of tension
In which
Where you can earn a good margin
By selling a skin for 500
The other person
Cant earn even by selling a skin for 800
Because he has to spend a lot of money
Maybe the business doesnt work
Because people follow Shlok
People trust Shlok
People say that I dont care about 100150
If I have to put a skin I will put a good one
I dont want to take a loss
Let me tell you two things
Our mode
Our factory
Because we have increased the entry barrier
If you want to compete with us
You need factory setup
You need machines latest technology
You need printing
The 3M paper
We source it from a different country
Our product is the best in India
It is best because
We have spent money
Entry barrier is of money
No one can make it better than us
No one
The other thing is
Distribution We have worked hard for it
It is like saying
You are coming to play basketball
You are tall 100 advantage
But I will use that advantage
If I have any advantage of distribution
I will reach my audience 100
And I feel
Even empty distribution doesnt work
Logan Paul and Mr
They are very popular in the US
Logan Paul has 2 million views
In the last video 23 million views
Mr Beast has 150200 million 300 million
Distribution is worldwide 150200 million
Only in US
In Hindi 1020 million
Mr Beast has more than 100 distribution
But Prime
It is a 7 billion dollar business
And Mr
Beasts fee stable
Is not that good
So I feel
Distribution alone doesnt work
Product should be good
I feel
If product is not good then nothing
Product should be better than market
But I feel
There is a way to spread message
It makes a difference
People get to know
You are making something good
You are telling the truth
If you work hard people will buy
It is easy to reach people
It is not that difficult to buy distribution
But it takes money
Most of the companies are in loss
If you promote in shorts
You will get 4050 million views
Conversion Conversion is not coming
Distribution is there
Conversion is not coming
Conversion is emotionally driven
When an influencer is connected
With a product
You wont be able to buy it
Even if you give 10 lakh rupees
You will get 40 million views
People will see
But people know it is an ad
When an influencer is involved in a product
Or the owner
Like I made distribution
I was famous
And I built things
Over a period of time
Now the company is doing the opposite
They knew they were figuring out a product
They made their marketing
They knew what to make
Now the owner is coming
To make a video
We also saw what the situation is and the owners
themselves are making it so I think those days have gone
that you just sit down and buy the distribution give 1020
lakhs spend crores the distribution will come the work
will be done those days
have gone because now people are used to sitting idle the
owner himself will have to come and sell or if he doesnt
come he will have to learn social media how content is
made how peoples minds have to reach them that is very
important to me
It is a big fight for everyone and if you are doing your
business then if possible then instead of paid
distribution focus on building a community make your own
social media where people trust you not for your product
but whatever you are delivering
now try to gather a community together so that in the
future when you subconsciously integrate your product it
keeps on selling
People will say lets talk about Elon Musk for example we
have been seeing him working a lot in the personal brand
100 at this time the value of words is very high and
the value of connect is very high so I think it will be a
major part
This is a hard question because our audience enjoys this
discussion How much business is being made from layers?
Approximately if we talk about the revenue point of view
If I tell you honestly our revenue is around crores but
because there are a lot of investments like I told you we
have invested in a design agency
In that our entire design agency will change that is the
new products we are building we have a design agency
outside India a UK design agency which basically designs
Together we are designing a product which we will launch
in AprilMay because it takes 8 months to make a
differentiated product So all the money we are getting
it is getting invested in new product development
So if you look at the actual profit on paper then our
profit will be almost 0 and we will be in loss because
more money is being invested in the next project So from
the revenue point of view we are doing decent because if
I tell you honestly
we would have to go international
In India it is a luxury purchase Skin is a very luxury
purchase and the market ahead of it is outside India And
after this I dont want to buy a small mobile accessory I
want to take a big jump in the consumer electronics space
I am not selling a TV I am not selling a speaker but I am
selling a watch When it will launch you will know
Everyone has said no everyone has said yes that is if
nothing is said on one then it is the same Lets go ahead
It can be a watch like this or it can be a mobile or it
can be a spaceship
What do you say? We are selling cars to go to Mars
Like I have a franchise business of Chole Bhature on the
Its been 8 years we are selling franchises
So I understood but is the revenue fluctuating? Is it
Revenue is constantly increasing I think when we started
it was increasing quite well Because we are not just
Techburner we have done marketing in many other things
besides Techburner
When I searched Google ads were running Ads are running
then we work with other influencers and do multiple things
And the community that buys continues to reach them
Launches keep happening so even old customers keep buying
I think one major reason for a business to be successful
like overlays and layers is that our customers buy again
We dont have onetime buyers
The person who buys from us once that is a lifetime waste
Normally what is the cycle? How many months does a person
change their skin on average?
In 6 months a person usually changes their skin There are
many people who change their skin in 34 months And there
are many people who like to change their skin Usually the
female customers I have seen their frequency is more to
change their skin
But our audience is dominantly male
Are you focusing more on Instagram? No I am not focusing
on Instagram to attract girls We dont have a major focus
on Instagram It is more on the lines that earlier the
fashion style that I used to think of I never visually
output it
I used to think that people will find it weird that a tech
creator is wearing this kind of clothes Or why is he
engaging in fashion? So I used to get scared I talked to
a lot of people and asked them how to do it So I used to
think that I dont stop
myself And even this fear let me tell you I even have
business values
Earlier when I used to make YouTube videos people used to
find it weird that I suddenly started talking about
business Because they dont know that I have done so many
things in the past It is the same thing on Instagram Now
people are thinking that
I have become a fashion person suddenly But for 23 years
I have been involved in fashion I have done designs I
have designed clothes I have done a lot of things So it
was a constant work in progress But now people have
started to see it
I think my focus is that for some time I want to sell only
to boys I dont want to sell more to girls Because the
marketer knows that
Why didnt you sell skins and cases? Because lets see the
audience is the same The skin audience was small and the
same audience could have sold more cases
In cases what is the brand of case in India that sells
printed cases well which is very successful? You will not
be able to get it Usually the cases that will be there
will only be of iPhone It will not be that everyone will
be selling If there
will be then the iPhone will be selling
The reason is that the supply chain is very difficult
There are so many challenges in the supply chain that if
you want to sell a good quality case for Rs 300400 it is
a very difficult business
And you will not make a profit in that Because I tell you
the case companies that sell so many cases you have no
idea People have no idea that tons of cases are burned
This is a very wastage When I was entering I thought of a
case only But I realized that it was a good decision for
the environment and everything Plus the supply chain is
so difficult that if we enter we would have made a
business But in that
I didnt want to get into accessories for a long time
I liked the skin of the case And we wouldnt have been
able to add something like this to the case The supply
chain of the case is difficult for a normal person But if
you put on the whole manufacturing setup
When an order comes do we already have the skin ready? I
will tell you operationally that I am not so much into
operations We have hired heads who lead operations But
around 30 remains with us
And our supply chain is so fast that if we get an order
now we can ship it by the evening Everything is packed
and shipped by the evening But the problem is that we get
more orders
And how much capacity do we have now? How much can we make
daily? I will have to check Because now we have 3
machines I dont know exactly but we can easily do
20003000 But I will have to confirm
I will tell you honestly that I personally dont get into
operations Because I dont have the strength in
operations For that I have brought the right people who
know it well And I think as a business owner our biggest
skill is that we should know
what we dont want to do and what we dont know
I have made a mistake by doing all this And I have learned
this from experience that I should bring someone else for
what I dont know I am involved in design product
development and marketing I know how to build a product
what is going on in the
market what is the demand of people how to design what
screw will be used what will be the finish what texture
will come how to open in packaging what smell should come
I am deeply involved in this
And I am deeply involved in the marketing part
I think I will tell you honestly operations is a job that
anyone can do
There are people in the market who can do it
And why should I do such a job that people in the market
can already do?
But the product development and design is very unique to
us No one else can copy that in the market So thats why
I try to do the same thing that only I can do
So how did you switch overlays? After skin?
I am not switching both are working together
No I mean why did you think that I do this too? We have
more alternatives to do
But why did you choose jackets? Did you feel that this
business is not being made a good business can be made in
a jacket?
No no nothing like that Layers are running well Layers
are running well Layers are growing
But lets see tan wise if we talk about making a bigger
business then we can make a bigger business in the
clothing line versus skin I will start with this point
So did you start clothing thinking this?
because we had to do it first
Ill tell you honestly we started with overlays before
layers I mean actually in the beginning we started with
overlays first We started with layers later
And in overlays what happened was at that time the entry
barrier as I told you the entry barrier was huge
If you want to make highquality clothes if you want to
make basic clothes 100 cotton Tshirts with a little bit
of print
You can make it anyone can make it
There are so many factories
But if you want to make clothes that beat international
brands there are only a few factories in India that can
make it for you
They have the machines
They have the things that will provide you quality at that
That was a big problem to solve
We have to beat them
But we dont even have that much money that how do you work
in such a big factory?
They take lakhs of orders
Now we dont even have the budget for lakhs of orders
It wasnt there at that time
We were just starting at that time
Then what did we do?
We decided how to do it
We wont sell less quality
We cant start selling less quality
We decided to make our own factory
We do everything
We have been running this factory for 225 years
We had bought a factory before this
It was 225 years old
We were making it
We were improving in every launch
Then we bought a big factory
And when we felt that our quality has been set
This is going to beat any international brand
We are selling at a price where no international brand can
Then we presented it well to the market
Till then we didnt do any marketing
Till then we did a little marketing in launches
But it reached the masses when we actually made a product
which people knew that we made it
And it is of good quality
And we are selling it at the right price
So thats why people saw it
But actually this thing has been going on for 335 years
And even now what happens is when we make more videos
people think that we have shifted the business
Its not like that
Majorly both things are growing together continuously
And we keep shifting it month by month
That this month is its launch
This month is its launch like this
So it will run continuously
But yes as you said
Kinzs market has an upper cap in India
To expand its cap now as I tell you layers you think its
promotion is not going on
But its promotion is going on outside India
We are figuring out how to do it outside India
So we are growing it more outside India
And we are figuring out things outside India
We dont even know about overlays in India
So in India we are doing it
So what is everyones strategy in doing things like this?
See how technical it is
I feel that many people understand Shlok
Thats why I wanted to do it with you
I have been connecting with you for a long time
Because most people understand Shlok as a YouTuber
They think he will set fire
And no one knows how smart he is sitting behind
Who has thought a lot strategically
When are the watches coming? I dont want to tell you about
the watches yet
You will know whether we will do the watches or not
What will be the price segment? Will it be affordable or
super premium? We are figuring it out
We are working very hard right now
I want to say this
And I can only tell you that we are working with the best
companies in the world
And we are giving a lot of time to the product we are
Usually the watch market there are many people who I know
Even just in general the consumer electronics market is
very quick
People dont know
The goods come from outside India
Same to same it is sold in India
By putting a brand
And we are optimizing a little bit here and there
But no one is working on the design the whole experience
the software end to end
I am feeling that way
And I feel that watches can replace smartphones
It has become so powerful
Because now a lot of things are coming in that space
So what we will take out will be expensive
Sustainability is my requirement
I wont tell you the price
I have a requirement in the watch
Put that in
Then I will start another new startup
I have decided on my own
Put a glucometer in the watch
In China many people are doing 8090
Because lets talk about CJM
You have also come to fitness
So you have started understanding biomechanics
So the CJM that has come nowadays
Many companies are selling it
It is 8090 accurate
So I was doing some research
There are some watches coming in China
It looks like a needle
It is doing it without a needle
It is doing it with sweat
And it is doing it in the watch
Many companies have made it in China
And it is also doing OEM for others
If it is 8090 accurate just imagine
I mean I am telling you
If the audience will understand then fine
If not then do it further
Normally I wear a watch
My walk is being monitored
If I give it my data my fat my height etc
Then it might be able to monitor my calories too
Now it is able to monitor my heart rate too
Now if it starts monitoring my glucose level too
Then what will happen?
As soon as I eat it will ask me Have you eaten anything?
Because it saw that my spike has come
I will say yes
Now it will ask what have you eaten?
I will tell it a little
Based on that it will calculate its calories
Now it will tell me
It will get to know after some time
Because AI is coming here
It will get to know from time
How do my fat burn go to my body? When I wore CGM I took a
one month trial
I mean I wore it for a month
So I got to know that fat burns are well absorbed on my
Normally it is bad for people
But it is not so bad for me
My body behaves well with fat burns
Similarly if I wear a watch then this data will start
If someone is under stress
Then how are fat burns affecting his body?
Just imagine how big a data set can be made
I mean my idea is
Because I dont want to get into hardware
I am a marketer a software guy
So I dont want to get into hardware
If someone makes it
I mean I have investors ready
That we will make such a product
Which is end to end
What is happening logically?
We are going to the doctor
There are many types of practical apps made these days
After that we have shared all the data of my watch
So he is getting to know
At what time did my glucose fluctuate?
At what time did my heart rate fluctuate?
What is my resting heart rate?
What is my walking heart rate?
Based on that he has done my full analysis
Now if my watch feels
That if someones resting goes so much
And he is eating this type of food
And this is happening because of it
So maybe his cholesterol can be high
So by default my app will tell me
Get a cholesterol test done
I did it
We filled the data
My one more data was added to my watch
He got one more learning
At this much cholesterol this persons heart rate remains
this much
And the food is absorbed like this
I mean there can be a fire in this thing
I mean what we call smart watch revolution
I think this can be a fitness band revolution
If anyone is watching tell me
I mean I am saying if you want to go ahead go ahead
I think it is 100
Because I have also tried those CGN monitors
And it is very good and useful
Even I am very much involved in health
That I have taken so many things in health
Now for example I did a mattress by sleeping on it
I also found that very interesting
I mean it is hot and cold
There are so many things
I am also taking a lot of supplements
I am figuring out a lot of things
And in the watch I feel like The problem I am seeing
If I tell you honestly
I see this problem
This is definitely a good feature
According to me the basics are not being done right now
I think the first thing should be
A standard good user interface
And all the things that are working accurately
So our focus is very different right now
Because we are not using all these features in this segment
We will not use it in the Apple segment
So according to me
The demand of the current user The price point at which we
want to go
We want to meet it very well
And if we make a fitness product
Then I will not make it in 3 months
I will make it in 3 years
And I will make such a product That after wearing that band
You dont have to do anything else
Because I dont believe in halfhearted things
That you are getting a sensor
Lets put it on and do it
There were a lot of things like this
We also made a smart ring prototype
We figured out how it happens in smart rings
All the watches were in smart rings
After that we tried different prototypes
And I can tell you that
Like you are telling one sensor
There are blind sensors
There are 10 things in the market
But I
I focus on the experience and go to work
And according to me
If I am aiming for a category Then I have to be number one
in it
If I am entering the Apple race
Then my goal would not be that
Apple takes this much market
It sells for 30000 rupees
Takes this much market
I take out 25000
Put one or two extra features in a little less feature
I dont go from that perspective
If I am entering a market Then I will make sure that
We make the best product in that market
Our product should be the best in the world
And then we sell it at a premium
That is my philosophy
If I cant beat Apple
Then I wont enter the Apple race
I will enter the product in 34 years
Where I have done a lot of research with health experts
Then I will go there and eat this
You dont even have to tell
The watch will tell you
Eat this in the morning
You will be healthy
So health is a priority
I will definitely do something in health in the next few
But for me
Because people have no idea
Because what happens now
I will tell you the biggest problem
We all are sick
We dont know
All the people in Delhi are sick
Everyone has no idea that they are sick
The thing that you cant measure
You dont know how sick you are
You have been sick since childhood
So you dont know that you are sick
You dont know what being healthy is
The thing that people cant measure
If I tell you Ill tell you a number if you are this much
sick and you can be this much healthier then you will
improve a lot
So I also feel that we take health for granted we dont
even know what is healthy
And if you go to the side of Japan Okinawa and all these
blue zones there are areas all over the world there
people live 100 years comfortably and they dont live 100
years they are trekking at the age of 90 they have abs at
the age of 70 naturally
good strong physique at the age of 70 their diet and
everything is good lifestyle diet a lot of things are
good so essentially you live 3 lives in one life I see it
like that too so I think that technology is coming it
will come slowly but it will
be very interesting the watch will also play a part in it
especially wearables will play a big part in it
I have a lot of watches but since I bought this I have
been wearing this only everything gets tracked somewhere
the phone also comes here a lot of other things come here
so I feel that wearable is next level thing it excites me
a lot and all the
best then I have told you this is smart questioning now
say it like this stop it we will tell you in the intro
Please cut this part it is not good
Thank you I got to learn a lot personally and I think the
audience also got to learn a lot
100 I also had a lot of fun talking to you knowing
everything even the conversation before the camera I
found it very interesting and I hope the things you are
doing the users the consumers they also got some help
but yes definitely a lot of
Thank you so much for coming thank you
So with this this video ends here I hope you enjoyed it
like it share it tell me in the comments how did you
like the video bye good day good night good morning
good afternoon whenever you are watching this video Jai
Hind Vande Mataram
all right so this is an iPhone 14 plus
pretty big phone but how big do you
think the biggest iPhone in the world is
so I wasnt expecting this but YouTuber
Matthew beam told me he was building the
worlds biggest iPhone a few days ago
and then he showed up with it this thing
is fully functional seven feet tall and
weighs close to 500 pounds it has a
power button here theres also volume
buttons and a mute switch its so tall
you have to get up on a ladder to take a
selfie with the camera because its all
the way up here but you know I am the
tech YouTuber so I kind of had to
investigate a little bit into how he
made this and first of all watch his
video for my full reaction on the thing
but turns out there is no iPhone
actually in here at all its actually a
Mac Mini in here which simulates running
a virtual Android phone and then that
Android phone is running a launcher that
makes it look like an iPhone all with
some jail rig Tech on the edges to make
it see where your finger is to make it
act like a touch screen all that to say
its not an iPhone technically but it is
still pretty impressive
Okay so one thing is that we havent done anything like this till now right?
I mean weve not gotten together
The collective influence of everybody on this table is crazy right?
Thats absolutely right
I mean this kind of influence
Gaurav bhai?
I mean one thing is that were talking about the round table but we havent got the whole
round done
We havent got the whole round done
Its half round
Yeah its half round
We kept the camera
We needed a place for the camera
So the thing is that this discussion is very important
not just for today but also for tomorrow
Whats going to happen tomorrow?
What is the future of technology?
And obviously you guys are also here
Well talk about the creator life
Well talk about everything
So I just want to put Ill put a bomb first
Why havent we done this till now?
Like what Like why havent we gotten together till
And why did it take us so long?
Because people have a perspective right?
That outside Is the tech community not together?
Is it like that?
Or not?
Efforts take a lot of time to gather everyone
That becomes a very difficult part
You guys have sent us such a big invite
So how can we not come?
I cant do that
No its all about taking one initiative
Like you guys took it
So So I want to chime in here
So I want to chime in here
So we apply for awards at TrakinTech
So even with this much value addition I didnt think Because we can tell from a normal
video that about which phones we liked
So we thought what is it that will you know you know really bring value
And I think that was the reason he said nahi karna hi
hai kitna bhi effort jaane do
And I think Aishat pulled it off
Nahi meko controversial answer chahiye tha
Yeh toh bahut hi diplomatic ho gaya hai
So Ill give you the controversial answer
I think yeh bahut hi hum log shuru kar rahe hain with everybody loves everybody
And you know yeh bahut accha
I dont think thats the real answer
I agree with you
Effort hai
Initiative liya kisi ne
But I also think that there is this thing in this community that why is it that we
dont have enough collaborations?
I mean why is it that in most videos were not doing things together?
It is because this is a overall community jahaan pe each of us is very cocooned in our
Hamara Instagram hamara YouTube hamara channel our personality our identity
Theres not enough
How many times have the three four of us collaborated?
Uska reason yeh hai na?
Ki matlab okay pehli baat toh locations koi Pune waitha hai
Koi Chile bhi waitha hai
Bihar wala menlo sab ek saath hote hain
Kaunsi collaboration?
Aap hamishchah camera leke aate toh ho?
Ki aaj aapko karte hain ki
Main toh allinclusive bhi hai
But Im just saying that if push comes to shove aur hum log ne if this whole topic
and this roundtable is all about being very very honest
I think Im not saying that there is any controversy to it
but I think hum log sab bahut inclusive hai within our own little cocoon of what we do
hum log zyada collaborative nahi hai abhi
And I think this could be the start of it all
Toh reason kya hai?
Kya hai reason?
I want to ask Devinder
Because he comes from that
I also agree
I also agree with Rajiv ki I feel ki tech community na
thodi si it is a competitive space
Actually aisa nahi hai ki
Matlab wo setup hi aisa hai
Ki jaise agar phone ka review jaata hai toh theres like three reviews going at the same
Toh essentially everybody is competing with each other
Everybody will see everyones videos right?
Lekin ek baat bolo mujhe dusri industry mein aisa nahi hota hai
Every industry is competing
Hota hai but I think in the tech community specially
India Asia right?
Where we basically
I think hum log ka competition zyada hai
I think we
The social media part of it is that we are more with I have
to be out first I have to have the product first
Hum log ki ego hurt ho jaati hain agar humare koi product nahi bol raha hai
Agar hum globally baat karte hain
Haan haan hundred percent
Ego hai baat
Hundred percent
I mean isme na
I think its possible
I agree with that
Agar Shlok ne ego bola hai toh at least itna toh hum agree karte hain ki Shlok ko toh hai
Main kehta hoon mere ko bhi hai
I am immediately agreeing you know everybody else can be as diplomatic
Ego doesnt have to be a negative thing
Yeah exactly
Theres no negative to it
For growth you have to respect yourself and you have to have ego that actually fuels your
Jo aage leke jaate hain isme kya galat hai?
But at the same time I would also
I would also add one thing ki I personally have a huge
amount of respect for everybody sitting here
Kyunki Gaurav has been working so hard and it has inspired him
It has inspired me
And how Arun sir and Rajeev sir have been helping me
I think it is very personal for me
And it is a very emotional thing for me
But also at the same time I think matlab yeh competitive space hai
And for that muskil bhi hota hai
Hum baat karne hai India mein aisa kyu nahi ki hai humne aaj
For that matter bahar bhi kisne kya kiya hai?
Agar hum aisa bol rahe hain ki hum sab competitive hai toh same goal for
I think waha pe thoda
But more or less same goal for the US guys yaar
Nahi but I agree with Gaurav
You know something we dont know Gaurav?
US guys ke baare mein?
Im just saying
Toh basically kya hai ki abhi tak nahi ho paya ab ho gaya
Acha okay
Just asking you personally
Yeh achieve karne mein kya kisi ko bhi chase karne mein
aisa laga ki koi off chal raha hai?
Nahi na?
All you had to do was just one call?
And just one message?
Surprisingly smooth ha?
Surprisingly smooth
Simple reason main aapko batata
December ke mahine mein humare paas content nahi hota
Yeh reality hai
Sachme hum log struggle karte hain
Sancheet iska matlab yeh keh raha hai ki agar maine phone karke bola hota
March April mein ya phir Diwali ke pehle sabse peak season mein tu nahi aata tha?
Nahi nahi
Main toh aata 100 Gaurav nahi hota
Gaurav nahi hota
I think unka matlab scheduling problem hai
Not a matter of main nahi aata kyunki
But hum sabki dates collide karte hai
Aur infact jab tech ki baat karte hai aaye din tech aati
hai aur seriously hum logon ka peth bhara hai
Honestly content hi kameeth nahi padti nahi hai toh thoda aisa lagta hai ki yeh theek
hai kamaayi bhi ho rahi hai
Main honestly bata raho
Ki mujhe aisa lagta hai ki ho rahi hai kamaayi?
Nah merko ho rahi hai
Main samjha nahi kamaayi?
What do you mean?
Ajit toh kamaayi karta hai
I only want them to say something
Devinder and Tamil
So first of all yeh bahut badi cheez hai ki we have achieved something like this
that all of us can come together and speak freely
Toh yeh bahut hi badi cheez hai
And I appreciate the efforts that you guys have put in
Pehle kyun nahi hua?
Iske multiple reasons hai
Its very evident that the tech community all of like
Im not saying ki hum log but bahut saare aisa content creators hain that they dont
get along very well
And that is the reason it creates a tension between all of us
Toh wo bhi rahta hai
Competition as you said is another thing
For us specifically language is also thoda sa barrier ban jata hai ki hum ek audience
ko address karte hain
Look at your Hindi man
Main toh shock hoye ja rahe hoon
Main dar gaya hoon yaar
This is fantastic
Main Rajasthan se hoon toh Hindi toh
Au phir toh phir
Ragh ragh mein hain
Toh ab humein yeh bhi lagta hai kahi baar jab hum collaborate karne jaate hain ki humari
audience bahut
saare audience South India se hai
So they might not understand if we change the language all together or if we try to
collaborate with a different content creator whos creating similar content
but in a different language
So that becomes a barrier sometimes
Aur aisa nahi hai ki humne collaborate nahi kiya hai
We have collaborated multiple times but this sort of collaboration hasnt happened
But this is something big
Tamil what about South?
Matlab and you guys represent Shaz and Tamil represent
You forgetting your own person?
Hes tracking Tamil
What is this?
What is this Arun?
Okay Arshad
Office mein baat karte hain iske baat karte hain
Nahi nahi mujhe bolo yeh South India mein yaar Tamil tech creators mein aise hi hain
yaar situation is different
Even we collaborated before itself
I came to your studio I collaborated for a video
Gaurav ke saath ek video kiya tha maine Sherlock se mil nahi paya so unse hi nahi
kiya tha maine
Jab maine try kiya tha har baar try karta hua main
No not you Im saying generally jaise hum baat kar
rahe the humare ecosystem kya ho rahe the South India tech people
Nahi usme yeh hi dikkat hai because most of the time kya hota hai na sabko beech
mein competition hi hai
Pehli cheez most of the things happen only in North India
Device jab South India ko aana hai vohi mushkil tha
pehli aap thoda thoda aaja tha
That is the main fact
So getting the device Is it only devices or something else beyond
Whatever it is the recognition recognition only recent past maybe the last three years
we used to get lot of recognition and the whole India is getting online plugin
Scale to Scale now we are getting but before if you
come even now people think me that Im from Chennai
Even if youre not in Chennai we can do the content
Thats how it is
We are in Pune
No no no
For South if Im from Tamil Nadu Im not from Chennai
And previously what used to happen is
Phone Erna or C4 Tech they used to be in Chennai
And the devices jo bhi aa raha hai sirf un log ko hi milega
So mere ko kya milega?
Kuch bhi nahi milega
Us time pe me Gaurav jab inne Dubai se video jab kar raha tha we can talk hell lot of
things about technology even without the device
Thats what I got to learn from watching these videos
Then I started doing those
Thats the biggest thing for me Again you have not answered my question
Your enmity you tell me Enmity competitiveness our Hindi
No no I do understand See I follow each and everyone
Literally everyone Ive subscribed to them I started my channel looking at your inspiration
and everything But the problem is that the regional
You need some kind of a difference when youre doing videos For me its like I create some
characters like Different companies as a character
Then you know thats how I picked up my channel But
again his question is not getting answered You guys are talking about you Is there better
camaraderie between all of you?
I dont know what I can direct you No not with all let me be frank
Im putting that out there
Not with all lets just get an answer Recently what happened?
I had a conversation with few of the creators earlier
So with the new kind of creators coming in And new guys are getting the views and everything
There is a chance Either you have to collaborate with them
Or youre just be on your own So which one you have to choose?
So what do you choose?
I just be on my own So this is what Im trying to say
That is the main thing The tech community is first choice
be on your own Im very glad youve done this
Even though youre saying it was very smooth and everything else
I still do believe that the amount of effort That has put into get this together Hats off
I dont think very many of us would have taken this on
Its a very difficult task Because while people saying yes
Is only one very small part of putting it all together
And I would really really hope that after this
The collaborations and that sort of cocooning Where we all go into our own little box breaks
So we keep using the word out of the box in tech Lets also do out of
the box content with each other
Not be But Ill answer your question which is like
Is there some kind of a clash?
Yes there is There is
Okay Okay Thats done Now coming to both of you
Here also right now youve said that you know We should work together and going forward
Still that competitiveness is going to be there
Still there is going to be that Who gets the first device?
Who gets the first video?
Why didnt I get it?
I saw the video No matter how much you do
I mean even with everyone If I didnt get the device and Gaurav got
it Then Ill call and ask
Why didnt I get the device that Gaurav got?
This is what we It happens
It happens right?
No it doesnt That is Shlok
Yes 100 Okay so I think
If there is competition If you look at it in a healthy way
Then it should be there
And there is nothing wrong with it At the same time We all know that we all coexist
Yes Its a fact And we dont want to hurt anyone
If I have to make a video with Shlok Then I know for sure
If I say anything He wont say no
I know And I think like I said
When he called When we spoke
Gaurav you are talking about inclusiveness We are talking about
What the point he has brought is Okay now let me ask you You will see that Shlok got
a device And you didnt get it
Call him We will do it together
Listen Ill give you an example Samsung Galaxy Note 8 or Note 9
I forgot the exact device I think Note 8
In which was the yellow SPen of golden color It was a blue phone with a yellow SPen Note
8 Note 8
Note 8 Note 8
Samsung launched in New York Okay I went to New York for Global Impact
I remember two people with me From YouTube side
I dont know about the other media people Ranjeet and Bharat
From IGN We three went
Now I was part of the Samsung Global Program and all So I got the phone with full box and
everything In New York
For the video Before launch I got the handson system
And because I was a part of the Samsung Global Team After that I went to Korea and all that
happened Ranjeet and Bharat didnt have that access
to the device Now I didnt talk to Bharat at that time
I was aware I mean I knew him
But we never talked I used to talk to Ranjeet
So Ranjeet got the device And just the device
No box nothing And that too for a limited duration Just for
12 hours Do whatever you want to do handson
I still remember There was a place here
There is a walk in New York
Which is built on a railway track Okay okay
Yeah It was just opposite the Samsung office I still remember the exact same thing I saw
Ranjeets face And he was like
What should I say now Just a phone
And I have a box So basically you wanted to make a video
So what did I do I told Ranjeet
I said do one thing Who knows that I have unboxed the same box
I said what happens in the box Thats the cable charger
I said I will make a video You keep the phone
You unbox it again And I did that
Excellent And here we have a very fine example Nothing phone
Yeah We had a similar thing When I asked for help Everybody has been ready to help
And this is with everyone And I keep asking And I didnt get the nothing phone personally
I dont know if it was a challenge Or I missed it
But I asked Arun for the phone
And he also I mean
He was getting a loss In giving the phone
If I am honest I think
Look Shlok honestly Sharing a device today
For that matter If we talk
Its not like Lets say I only have access
Or you only have access And they will have it
If not today it will happen tomorrow So the main point is If you say no lets say
Does not End the world for that person
You will get the access Why not put together
I want to ask a question There is a brand discrimination here Like
Is there a level playing field For everyone
There are small creators At what level is that
And here is At your level you are talking about this
Imagine a smaller level
I am proud to say This is a very good conversation
Because this is more or less A congregation of the top creators
Top creators This is a little
Lets bring it down to the reality No no no
We were not there before When You know 34 years back 5 years back
We were small At that time Gaurav was big
We did not have it And we know that situation
But was there a struggle or not It was a struggle
Thats what he is talking about Is there a level playing field today
We are talking about There cant be a level playing field
Level playing Ranjeet Trophy player
Will not get selected in the IPL He will have to work hard
We can do examples of cricket and everything else There is always going to be
Someone that is going to be Now moving forward
At one time you were not as big You were not as big
There was a struggle period Today a brand Knowing that it is the biggest creator Has
created a level playing field For them
But is there a divide As he said devices are available in North
India Not in South Are all these things still relevant
I think this is an important one Because this is going to be watched by all
brands Could we make life a little bit better for everybody By bringing forward some of
the challenges In this sense
What is a level playing field Numbers for brands
I am talking from brand perspective Now there are about 10 YouTubers
Who are more than 5 million subscribers They should go
Now level playing field Still does not happen that 8 out of 10 people
go Why?
Because brands Also have their biases towards certain things
Its not even bias I will say if its my company
I have this water bottle
I will give it to whoever I want This is what I am also trying to say out here
I completely agree As a brand it is completely their choice
Brand is not out there To create a level playing field in the content
But why did nothing discriminate To the South entirely
Very important question to ask Lets not get too specific
It cant be NorthSouth But it happens
It happens a lot I think
He made a point also North India has more access
Delhi has more access Like you said
Lets not go into a specific incident But its not one specific incident
I have heard about it many times There is a stage 1 and a stage 2
For everything to be sent out And eventually
The reality of the business that we are in Which is content creation
Where views matter Who watches your video matters Are you not interested in the number
of views
When your video goes out after 1 hour After 12 hours You do look at it
You dont ignore it If you are going to get a device
About 2 weeks after If you are going to send out All their unboxing
and reviews How do you expect everybody else To get the same number of views I think there
is that It is understandable But it is a brand prerogative
First access that is the reason why Because the one who will post it later
Is not going to get it Is our space all about first access Let me
be very very clear It is all about views
But sir first access brings views I bought the device earlier
I dont even get devices from the company I buy it from the market
We have done it too Thats what I do
What I like about what he is saying Is that
Uniqueness There is a uniqueness in the content That also brings the views
I know many people globally Who still buy devices
And their videos are fantastic Views can be 5000 4000 10000
But still The production quality and the interest
Is clearly visible And he is buying the device
Ill give you my own example
You must be assuming that I get side devices
I shop for 810 lakhs every month just to buy devices
And I think we all have it
We are not talking about shoes and clothes
Im not talking about that
So this thing I mean somewhere
But you bought the iPhone
Bro leave this
I dont think anybody will think about that
Ill give you my example
Even today lets say there is a brand which is not operating in India
Or if it is then I dont have access to it
Ill buy it
Hoping that one day we will have connects
We dont have it today
And I think all of us have done that stage before
But we cant do it for each and every device that is launching
Thats where the problem comes
Its about the level then
Today when I started YouTube
When all of us started this journey
We all started at one level
In the beginning we talked only about devices
Then we went to events
Then we get devices
So there is always a level 1 2 3
I will agree with him completely
Because even this IBTR for that example
We have taken this risk
Because getting all this together putting all that effort
We dont know whether we are going to get views
But we have to do it
You have to take that risk
Like you said we cant buy all the devices
No you have to
And if it works good
If it doesnt it is a risk
Same I would say for me also
Because when I started
When I was making videos
Everybody was popular
I think for 35 years
I made videos without any phone
And I didnt have money to buy a phone
So what I used to do was
If a phone launched I would make a video without the phone
Thats it
This phone came out
These are my opinions
Thats how we started
At that time opinion videos were also very popular
My first video that went more than 10000
Was OnePlus 5
Where I made an opinion video
And thats how it started
But that was the first video
And at that time it was very popular
I started from Dubai
There was no access there
And I did those
So you know what
I want to segue into that
I want to ask a question
If a new creator wants to start today
You can make opinion videos
If I dont get devices today
Today is the time where
Unboxing videos
Are on their way out
There is nothing on the box
You actually take a look at it
I think the most boring thing now for an audience
Is unboxing
Its boring for us also
I dont disagree
Unboxing is fun
Opening the box is very exciting
Shlok is your unboxing
It is the most exciting thing
Unboxing today
Forget about the phone
If you unbox anything
It will get you all the eyeballs
But I am saying
Unboxing today is the same as it used to be
We used to do it earlier
Its exactly the same
I have seen them do this
I have seen Arun do this
The kind of excitement that they bring to the videos
Is crazy
But I am saying that we are now reaching that stage
Where the audience
May not be sharing the same excitement
I will tell you why
When I agreed with you
Unboxing as a process
Why is unboxing fun?
What Shlok says
It is
Every time you open a box
There is something new
Something different
The emotional connect
That is not important
The excitement of seeing a new thing
A new phone
A new design
Unboxing a car
That mystery
I will give you a great insight
About all our videos
I will tell you who watches our unboxing videos
Lets say you unbox a new iPhone
I am someone
Who wants to buy the iPhone
And I have ordered it
Its showing me delivery in 2 days
For 2 days
I will watch 510 unboxings of iPhones
I know they are going to be the same
I have done this
Its my emotional thing
I will watch Sanchits
I have to buy the Steam Deck OLED
I have been looking at every single day
When it shows me its out for delivery
I will still watch those videos
For that excitement
I will go one step ahead
Once I buy a phone
Even after that
I am watching on my Vivo
I am watching on that phone itself
Its an emotional thing
I will tell you the part
That I think has changed
When unboxing as a concept came
For the viewer
For us
For everybody else
There was a lot of mystery
And unboxing was magic
Because no one
Including you when you got the box
You didnt know what is going to come out
The way marketing is today
With all brands
How much of it is still a surprise to you
Almost 90 of the reveal
Has already happened also for you
And for your audience
Then why are people watching millions of videos
India has a population
It wont be exciting for us
100 Initially
We put a camera over the head
Opened the box
We evolved
We changed the camera
We added expression
Unboxing has evolved to a completely different level
Only the smell of the box
And everything else
And then you just close on the fact
That you are just opening a box
And you are describing
This is a good box
It has an emotional feel
While it is fantastic
The marketing
If you look at the brand strategy today
Their marketing
That is based on a reveal
Of 90 of everything
Because they are trying to make sure
Let me just finish this
A brand today
Is trying to make sure
That their product
Is coming after 2 months
Somebody is not making a purchase decision
They want you to wait 2 months later
For their product
And therefore they want to start revealing
A lot more
Even for brands
That used to be very secretive about everything
Whether it is done conspicuously
Behind the scene
Under the table
Everything gets revealed
In short he is saying
2 years ago
It is Shlok
Doing the unboxing
Shlok speaking
Arun speaking
Arun dropping the phone
Gaurav doing
There are channels on YouTube
They dont say anything
There is no face
Getting millions of views
You have to understand
It is the only claim
Dal rice can never be boring
It is a point
Yesterday we were shooting a product
And we were taking a lot of shots
We had to peel off a lot of places
My team is telling me
People love to see this shot
Peel off and all this should happen
Whether it is significant or not
Because that attracts a lot of audience
And the connection
Which can relate
That adds a lot of value to the video
But BBomb doesnt do unboxing
When you are testing a new product
Peel off
You guys have cracked the Instagram code
Kitchen appliances
Teach us
Like we were talking
We get a lot of products
Because we get a lot of products first hand
You get it or you buy it
I am coming to that
The products we cover
90 of the products are bought by us
So we are spending a lot of money
A lot of research that goes behind it
A lot of your products are from abroad
Do you guys do that?
Unique items
There was a Lyric speaker
I think it was 152 lakhs
We had to purchase it
There was a Nike selflacing shoes
That we bought for 55000
It takes 12 months for them to arrive
So do you reach out to the companies
Or you just buy it?
Reach out is a lengthy tedious process
So we buy it
Its a tedious process
Its a long process
It means there is a lot of money behind it
To buy that
When he looks at that product
He knows that when I make a video on it
It will get a lot of views
Its a business
Its an investment
Into the future
The question that you had
Sorry carry on
When we started building Instagram
We have very clear intentions
That Instagram is a different platform
YouTube is a different platform
So we treat them very separately
Yes we make content
On both the platforms
Like there is one product
The content will go on both the platforms
But they will be done in their own separate ways
There is no crossposting
Sometimes they use two different videos
Rupesh is for YouTube
And Akshay is there for Instagram
So the idea is when we started building Instagram
We made sure that we are going to invest
This much amount of money
In building this
And in that strategy we were clear
That we will not accept any paid campaign
So that was our strategy for the first one and a half years
Jab tak hum 1 million hit nahi karenge uske baad yes obviously but abhi bhi agar aap
dekhoge toh frequency bahut kam hai because our approach is audience first
Agar audience ko hum bahut zyada bombard karne lagenge paid content se so they might not
start liking it
So its always to add value to the audience
So Ishaan your question so coming back to it this is a great point your question was
very different from where this discussion went away
Your question was if a new person whos never done this before is just starting his
channel is unboxing the video and my answer was not for that person
No he did not ask about unboxing he said he just said
new creator only you put that unboxing thing
Im going round this thing one tip that you want to give
to a new creator starting with Rajiv
I think Im going to go with exactly what he said because that is really my entire
spirit and philosophy jo maine
pehle din bhi shuru kiya tha when I started what was not happening anywhere in the world
which is a television show on tech right the
strategy remains the same the tip remains the same agar aap alag nahi kar sakte passion
ke saath nahi kar sakte and youre only going to follow someone elses success you are
100 going to be a failure
Find the passion and you have to be dramatically different
Inhone ek strategy banayi bahut clear strategy hai well
buy it well not take paid campaigns we have something where well do things very
very different
They understood the platform that Instagram is very different from YouTube
Understand what you are doing do not be a sheep or a herd ke uski shlok ki badi achi
unboxing hai he does this and he drops the phone ye ek weighing machine
rag dete hain ke achar iske itne gram hai Gaurav does this way of if
you are going to take bits and pieces and segments from all the
others and you want to then create your own personality youre going to
be a split personality with nothing happening
The strategy cannot be different today content will always be king queen prince ace everything
its not going to change the strategy must be that
Gaurav aapta hai?
Yaar mujhe lagta hai internet is a youth stage aur sab
ke liye audience hai saamne wo aaj nahi hai ho sakte hai ek saal baad aayegi hum on
a beginner level to be honest main bolta hoon kisi ko bhi dont invest ek x amount
kyuki wo return karne ke chakar main dimaag mein rehega na
ki main ne itna paisa lagaya main ko chahiye chahiye chahiye dont do that
Log camera kharitte hain team lete hain kuch dharwat nahi hai aaj ki date mein all
you need is your phone
You did it alone for so long
Mainne shuru ki 100 video apne phone mein banaya thi woh front camera se why front
camera because rear mein uska preview dikhega nahi to selfie se banaya hai main anyway
Aaj ki date mein you just need to start aur platforms
like Instagram YouTube short video bahut zyada rewarding hai and it all kind of you
know requires just you being consistent
Aapko 100 din tak target kar lo main 100 din tak 100
videos har roz post karunga usme se 10 video definitely
viral jayenge hi jayenge and you dont need anything
aapko box nahi chahiye phone nahi chahiye kuch nahi chahiye you just want to talk
to people just talk about anything kuch bhi topic hai
aapko baat karni hai thats all
You know this is beautiful it just ties up with what I
wanted to say patience because I have been the most patient person when it
comes to channels
You know when I started Trakin Tech first 1 year we went only from 0 to 3000 subscribers
in 1 year when I was
posting me and Prateek were posting 1 video every day matlab nearly
August 2016 se leke May end 2017 tak 1011 mahine continuously daal de hai aur humare
3000 subscribers ho gaye kabhi bhi ek video 10000 ke upar nahi gaye but I knew someday
we are going to crack it and then 1 video jo 1 plus 5 ka hai I still
remember that wo gaya and then we just took off
So my thing is unique raho aap consistent raho har roj
video daalna hai ya hapte mein ek daalna hai ya mahine
mein ek daalna hai jo bhi decide kiya hua hai wo karo consistently and be patient
results will appear
Ill give a very fine example we had started another
shorts channel Wittipedia naam ka entertainment pe you know we had given them 6 months
even after me knowing me being mujhe pata hai ki itne saare channels hai
ki nahi hoga mein bola 6 mahine hum log karenge agar nahi
hota hai toh we are going to dismantle we are not going to put much
Every day hum daal rahe hain uske upar videos 6 mahine ke baad it was what hardly 2000
ya 3000 subscribers ho gaye we dismantled the team 2 mahine chale gaye because host
wo gaye rahe liye the bahar se 2 mahine ke baad suddenly
1 short went that in that 15 days ek short viral jaane ke baad
we went 400k subscribers in 400k 4 lakh subscribers in 15 days aur
mere paas abhi team nahi hai toh Anson ko wapas bola nahi wo log chale gaye
toh main wohi
bol raha hoon so patience
Look I feel I agree saari cheezon ke saath I think consistency zaruri hai I think saari
cheezon hai but mere khayal se ek cheez jo ek creator ko successful manauti hai wo
hai ki jo maine ghari hai merle work ghari hai
ke bhai main apni audience se kabhi jhoot nahi bolta main jaisa jo
cheezein hain hoon and ya light aayi hai aur coffee aagayi
hai toh aapke aachanak se continuity continuity
continuity there was a power cut humare bottle ke colour
bhi change ho gaye green to blue so okay go ahead
But ek cheez maine notice kari di ki jab sab bata rahe
the kisi ne algorithm ki tags title aise dalna
thumbnail aise lagana hai kisi ne koi baat nahi kari and
I think I also agree ki ek doi bande ek jo person video banara hai ek jo person video
dekh raha hai agar aap us audience se dil se connect kar sakto aur usko kuch valuable
de sakto toh aap video chalegi aaj nahi toh kahl nahi toh parson ek saal lakh sakta
do saal lakh sakta kabhi na kabhi toh chalegi aur main bhi starting mein
mera bhi bhi tha ki main callin mein baata tha na paise the kuch bhi nahi tha mobile
se hi maine bhi video banayi thi jaise hum sabne start kara tha and tutorial banara
tha main toh mobile mein yeh aise karlo software mein yeh karlo thod tej
rahega aise ek saal banaya and woh dheere dheere pehle
10102020100100 views aan lagaye toh fir bad gaye toh mera bahut simple hai ki
agar main kuch audience se dil se connect karke kuch de paa raha hoon and main honest
hoon toh grow hoonga and maine jitte bhi YouTubers ko dekha jo
kuch actual acha kar rahe hain woh apni audience se bhauti zyada connected hai toh mere ke
aata hai woh sabse aad important hai toh tu aise kahe raha hai ki thumbnails aur titles
important nahi hai nahi
but woh change hote rahata hai na woh constant nahi hai toh titles are very YouTube specific
thing why do I feel like everything that I agree its a very
YouTube content creation could be Instagram but content creation I agree completely I
was just saying it is like saying ki yaar app
banane ke liye wali exercise karlo are khaan acha khao exercise
karlo apna ban jate hain kya baat se kuch sauce nahi all
right haan matlab mujhe aise lagta hai ki isme ek knowledge dene se better hai
toh ek raw thought share karta hu jab bhi hum audience ki baat karte hain hum bol jate
hain woh insaan hi hai jaise ki agar hum ek apne apartment me rahte
hain society ki baat karte hain toh mujhe aise lagta hai ki jo insaan baate achchi
karte hain na impact full baate karte hain ya
phir logon ke hit me baate karte hain woh hamisha achcha maana jata hai kisi bhi society
me toh ye thought maine apne aapme built in kiya abhi jab recently meri video nahi
chal rahi thi jab maine thoda comeback
ka socha hai toh mujhe tha yaar toh achchi baatein hoti hain na woh society mein kabhi
khatam nahi hoti aur society hi hume dekh rahi hai toh aur YouTube pe aap popular
kyun ho gaya apni baaton ki wajah se toh mujhe aise lagta hai ki maine bohot
kaam kiya apni speech ke upar bhi pauses kab lene chahiye impact kab dalna hota hai
toh jaise ki society ka example ek bohot acha rahata hai ki humein
log hi toh dekh rahe hain achchi baatein karoge 100 log dekhenge aur agar aapka
kisi cheez mein passion hai jaise mera tech mein mujhe
pata hai kisi bhi time baatein karalo uski baatein mein karunga
log sunenge toh mujhe se lagta hai ki yeh bohot basic cheez hai ki mere hisaap se baatein
achchi karne wale log jo hai chalte hai
You tell no?
Youre the creator
Dont be a moderator
Youre not a moderator
Im not
Im genuinely not moderating
None of us are talking till Ishaan doesnt
Yeh nahi ho raha hai
I dont have anything to tell people
Because Ill tell you mera toh main journalist tha yaar tech journalist mein usse yaha
main kya hoon?
But Im going to Im going to ask you
Ill keep quiet too
Both of us are similar
So then Ill keep quiet too
Listen har ek ka experience and I have a feeling that you and me have more to contribute
to this conversation kyunki hum log do platform se aarein
So tell me what do you think is the content creator that
jo aapka question tha answer it
I mean ek toh pehle define kar lo apne aapko ki content creator banna hai ki you know
you wanna do
So I think that journalism still has value mereko honestly waise lagta hai wo ek cheez
Doosra yeh ki I completely agree with the whole consistency bit
Because mereko toh usse because Ive seen that myself kyunki main toh abhi Im starting
Like for example you know Arun and I immediately had a conversation ki Tamil chalu karna hai
me bolein tikka chalu kar dete hain lets start it
And the only thing was consistent rao bas wo hi kiya aur kuch
Acha content kiya consistent rao like you said
Talk to the people
Thats the same I mean all of the answers just almost I have nothing new to add but
all of this is helping me in
building what I want to build right now
Bas utna bolunga
Wo maybe will help you also to build what you want to build
Aishwarya I want to ask and this will come as a surprise but do you think journalists
nowadays are overrated?
No not yeah yeah of course
But the best part about journalism is
Journalists right now is that they have platforms multiple platforms
I feel that in a lot of places it has happened that they
have also come on YouTube right?
Whether whatever beat they are covering now
Okay so if you have to say that YouTube creators the content creators on YouTube are on top
or the journalists are on top?
There is a reason why I am asking this
In which perspective are they on top?
Whats your perspective?
The perspective to look at is the societal perspective
Forget yours
What is the societal perspective?
Its looking fun right?
I want to see
Because you are a journalist you are a content creator now
And also we expect a diplomatic answer
No I am not going to become a diplomat not at all
See what is the problem of a journalist?
He studies from school right?
Then he is told who what how and when to follow
So maybe in that they are not connecting with the people that the content creators
Okay tell me one thing
See I have noticed it
Why do tech journalists hate YouTubers?
He is the one who made me do it
And I have got a very cold vibe from these people
Whenever I go to an event they give me such a cold vibe
I think he is laughing but I dont know why
Okay I will tell you
Lets do one thing lets finish this flow first
Then we will take the next question on this
Okay come on
The one thing is that dont do this for the moneys sake
Everybody wants to start a YouTube channel because they will get monetized
Thats what they all want to make
Okay I want to make some money out of it
No if you have genuine interest let it be tech or
If you think that you can put it out there in a very you know in a different and unique
And inconsistent
Then I think its a good option
If you are doing just for the money then I dont think
this is
Its not a job
But why is it not a job?
It shouldnt be one
Because its not that specific
Why is it not a career?
Why is it not a profession?
Its a career its not a job
I dont see any difference in those two
Its a career but not a job
People are only looking at the monetary thing
They are just forcing them
You should look at the monetary
I am not really understanding the its a career not a job
Dont do it for money
Money no matter what you do in life
It will come its a byproduct
Thats a given
Whats the problem with those people on YouTube?
Those who think that YouTube gives lots of money
And if they do it after thinking about it
Thats what I am saying
They will always be behind the mind always thinking about money
And at that time when they realize that they are not going to make money
Then they will be demotivated
And they will lose track
They should know that if you invest 23 years in it
There is a high chance that you will be successful
And money will follow
But if you think that he has earned this money
And I will also earn it
I will do it
There is no such formula
Thats what I wanted to convey
But thats for every business
Every job every profession
There is nothing different that we are saying
In YouTube the journey is not linear
In content creation its always exponential
Arun said that he has 3000 subscribers in 11 months
That was the path
And then
I just want to say something out here
Hold on to this exponential point
Because I am going to ask a question on this
Most of it is already covered
But two things that matter the most
Obviously you have to be consistent
And if someone is going to start today
I think short videos is the way to go
That gives you an entry barrier
Platforms reward
On YouTube you just have to play with the algorithm
You have to be consistent
You have to follow a schedule
That you always have to follow
And on Instagram you have to make content that is share worthy
That works
And second thing is you have to pick a niche
That comes to you naturally
Because all of us sitting here
We didnt choose tech
Because tech is the most lucrative
We chose it because we are desperate
We chose it because we are definitely interested in it
Naturally it came with us
Because of this I think these are the two points
If you fake it it will show
You have to have real passion for it
There was a question that was asked at one another
Can you fake it till you make it?
Not in the current content creation
It shows
People are too smart here
Not in any aspect
Any aspect
One tip
Almost all the points are covered
Second point is dont think
Just act
Most of the time we just keep on thinking
Whenever we
Stop this video now
Thats what usually happens
We overthink a lot
Because we see a lot of creators doing wonderful jobs
Covering most of the things which we dream of
Then we suddenly go
We dont have anything
What do we do?
Then we plan for something
Then suddenly we see the same thing
Which was done by some other people
Its not about doing the thing today or tomorrow
Its about just act
We have answered all the questions
On the topic of exponential growth
I want to pick that point
Do you consider yourself
Are you a celebrity?
Let me put it in a nicer way
How do you feel when some fan comes
Comes and talks to you
Takes pictures with you
What is the difference between your
Stardom and a celebrity stardom
That an actor or an actress has
Like a Bollywood actor or actress has
Its more of a brotherly connection
What happens in a celebrity
If theres a movie star
Its always a one way communication
The person will go watch the movie
And come back
Hes commenting
But he cant hear anything from the front
Its always one way
The content creators
And their followers
Its always a two way communication
Because we address them
Its somewhere happening
A two way communication
Second thing
The relatable vibe
Hes like us
He did this and that
And now he makes videos
The way people approach us
Its very comfortable
He wont get stuck
Hell come and talk to us
Its very simple
Its very friendly
Youre absolutely right
You know what happens
Ill tell you the reason
Everyday theyre watching us
We watch the news
What happens with movie stars
They watch one or two movies a year
Its very indifferent
But when they meet
And they literally faint
The die hard fans
These people
Tell us about the die hard fans
Best fan interaction
This is a long time back
One and a half year back
One guy literally came on the road
In one instance
He fell down from the bus
Because he had to walk
And second
One guy fainted
I was on the bike
And then he was like
And then he fainted
For just a minute
Day before yesterday
They could not even type the number on the phone
Phone doesnt unlock
Camera doesnt open
Ill tell you one with me
Which I thought was an incredible incident
In a public bathroom
I am there
That person is there
We are in the act
We are both
He is in the public bathroom
He turns around
He sees me
He just went completely nuts
He took the selfie then
Thank God at the right angle
If it was a typical selfie angle
That would have been a problem
I thought
He saw Rajeev
And he turned towards Rajeev
Shaz you wanted to say something
Like I said
The celebrity thing
They come and say
My phone is broken
What can I do?
Go to a service center
This is a very interesting point
That we connect
We are not on top of a mantle
We are not on a big platform
It is not like that
It isnt like that
It is a good connection
I think most of the times
Besides a selfie or a conversation
I think most of the time
We are also asked for advice
Which phone which TV which laptop
Thats become part of our lives
And that is because what Arun said
We are there every day
Telling them the same things
They just come to us
And that video will continue with them
I think celebrities
If I were to look at it
From an audience standpoint
Have a higher status
Their job is to build perception
I went to watch a cricket match
I bought an expensive ticket
But I was thinking
How many celebrities
Can buy a ticket
But they cant come to a normal stand
Because they have to build a perception
That yes we are on top
I think it is important to build
To watch A person
To watch You have
You have You have
You have Then you
Once a year
So I think the perception is that its inaccessible for a celebrity
So the scarcity there
increases the perception and aspiration
I think the exclusivity makes them the celebrity
Its the status
Celebrity obviously they are higher but
I was talking about
Not necessarily higher to be honest
Content creators are failing big celebrities
on your date
Thats very obvious
our video
has to open YouTube
a celebrity
to buy a ticket
to drive
to come to a hall
to sit in a crowd
become their dad
I wont take names but Ive had experiences
where Ive overshadowed people
Its a reality
Im not kidding
Who made celebrities?
And then people
Who is making us?
You talk about Bollywood politicians
people who are famous in multiple ways
as long as you are
top of the hill
In any field
its a similar experience
Ill tell you a small story
Like everyone was saying
celebrities are not approachable
They are YouTubers everyone agrees
Ill tell you a place
DC Chowk in Rohini
My car is parked there
And so many approachable people understand us obviously because we all share a
brotherly vibe
He came in the car
You are Sanchit
When he wanted to meet me he showed his hand
I wont tell you the cars experience
He gave me a good enough
five to six second pose
And I was like this at that time
What should I do?
And then he didnt take a selfie
He didnt take any selfie
He just called me white for a long time
And thats it
Ill tell you
I was like okay
Listen to my car experience
Its about Dubai
The three of us went out for tea at night
Im driving
Porsche Panamera
Carry is sitting on the side
We went to a place in Dubai
Its called Disco Chai
Its an official name
We went there and had tea
The person who was serving us was from Bangladesh
He was 2223 years old
He was a subscriber
He took a selfie with me
Then he saw Carry
He left
Then he came back
Can we take a selfie in front of a car?
We said okay
Carry and I were standing in the middle
He took a selfie
We started drinking tea
He was standing there
He said can we take a selfie inside the car?
I said okay
He wanted a selfie in my car
He sat in the car
Finally he got a photo
He was sitting in the back
I was in the driving seat
Carry was sitting next to me
Were back
Thats good
Gaurav tell us something
Back after 1015 minutes
He said can I sit in the back?
You two can sit in the front
Then he said Gaurav sir can you take a photo?
He gave me his phone
He said hell never get a selfie like that
Theres a car
Im in the driving seat
I took a selfie
Hes sitting behind us
This is inside a Porsche
We left
We discussed
I said if he didnt ask he wouldnt have got a photo with us
He wouldnt have got a photo in the car
He wouldnt have got a selfie
Why did he ask?
Because he had that comfort
Otherwise he wouldnt have got a photo
Here he took 3 good photos
Im sure hell tell a big story around to his friends
This is the difference of approachability
Thank God he didnt say drive the car
I would have driven
As long as Im free
As long as I have time
It doesnt matter
Its only because he was asking for it
I was at the airport
A guy came running
He was using a OnePlus phone
Zen mode
In Zen mode you cant do anything
He took out his phone
I was free at that time
I took a photo from my phone
I asked whats your email?
He got the photo
Otherwise he wouldnt have got the photo
Just because theres approachability
Everybody whos watching the show remember if you meet Gaurav if he has a car make
sure you take it
Its happened many times
All the time
Open offer now
Ill come to that
Specifically asking him
Trolling is anonymous
Weve all developed a thick skin
I dont know
Im just presuming
We continue with our work
When your peers roast when your fellow YouTubers roast there was an incident with a Tamil
I would want him to talk about that
Recently that happened to me
Where to start?
Weve been in the space for a long time
Most of us got the roasting trolling everything
What we do is we just ignore and we cross
Thats what we do
If time and again youre getting the same kind of thing people will start hate you
for the thing which youre not
Thats where youll feel uncomfortable
It happened to me too
Four years ago a man said something wrong in my name
He uploaded 34 videos
The real face of
The Tamil version of the video about TG in Hindi will be uploaded on my channel
It used to happen
Someone is making fun of someone whos doing the video in Hindi and getting some views
Theyre following the same thing in Tamil
I know this and I ignore it
But it comes to a point where I have to show my identity
card telling this is my name
Tamil Selvan is my name and this is my identity and I dont have to fake it
This is where it started
Theres a story ahead
There are a lot of things
It added up
Recently what happened is I saw a video someone was making fun of two
other channels
One was mine and someones channel
Up to a point I was not worried about that particular
thing because over the past few years I came through a lot
of stuff
I ignored that one
Then all of a sudden I got a lot of negative things
Then I thought what do I have to do?
Either I have to ignore and move on or I have to speak whatever is in my mind
Because there are a lot of pressures I was building for the past few years without
talking anything
Because YouTube we all have our passion profession whatever it is
I mostly dont often spend time with my friends and everything
Most of the time its in my YouTube channel itself
Comment section Twitter everything is there
The pressure got up to me and suddenly whatever that comes into mind I shot a video
But I havent uploaded that
I didnt upload that video
I kept it as it is
I didnt
Then I stopped it
Then I came to know that the other person who was in that video because I initially
texted him bro this is the thing that is happening this guy this particular
channel is talking about both of us
What we have to do?
Because I dont have experience in facing this kind of pure roasting
He said simply ignore
Ignore and move on
I used to do that
I will do that again
But that other guy went on and commented on his channel telling that okay from now on
Im your huge fan
Im your follower
Then all the TV channels all the other YouTube channels all the comment section filled with
hate of this particular guy is the biggest YouTuber
He apologized and he commented you are so rude and you
are not even saying anything
That pressure got into my mind
Then I shot the second video not even thinking anything whatever that comes in my mind I
shot the video
Thats where I was little bit out of the way
Whatever that comes in my mind
I reedited but by that time we had some other issues as well but I committed my subscriber
that I will be uploading the video on Sunday
Every Sunday I will be uploading a video
I know the video is not 100
I dont have the time to check because the video has to go live
So first thing is I have pressure from inside
Second the day is also I have to upload the video
Then I went on with the video
Once the video is live I switched off the phone and everything
I went to sleep
Suddenly the next morning even without seeing the
comments I realized that what have I done?
You made a mistake
I immediately wanted to take the video out and give
something for my viewers
This is not me
This is what is in my mind
I wanted to say this and I said it like this
I was thinking
Then few other people were telling you dont need to go and
do this
Just work on it
Then it started biting
now we are facing the backlash
What is the backlash?
Two years back?
No no right?
No six months
Six months
What is the backlash you are facing?
Negative comments in each and every video
Every video
I talk about Ratan Tata I see the negative comments
I make a review telling the phone itself is not good for
that money its not value for money and people started commenting you are getting some x
amount of money from this brand and you are
How do you come up from that?
How do you all come up from that?
Lets talk about he is not spoken Sanchit is not spoken
which I am very surprised about Sanchit
What is happening?
No no when he told his story it obviously happened to me too
It has happened
Obviously when fellow creators say it it hurts a lot
But the best part is what happened to me
First I developed full hate within myself for a month no doubt
But then in the starting days Shlok and I used to talk a lot when YouTube started
He told me that if you hate a creator you will never be able to learn from him
What I did was when there was a lot of buildup inside hate I said lets convert it into
Lets try to work on all this negative energy
What will happen if you sit quietly in the corner and show anger?
So now I have become a toxic trait for trolls
If I dont get hate I dont get motivation
I look for it sometimes
Gaurav Gaurav
I will tell you a story about Sanchit
I think it was 2017 or 2018
YouTube did a competition
The YouTube community in India was a little weak at that time
I mean the online community YouTubes community
The overall community
So there was a YouTube program where they collaborated with
And they invited for entries
If you want to go on a community post you have to upload
Like if you are a YouTuber just to make sure that the YouTube communitys blog post gets
a little active
So got some I think 34 thousand entries
We shortlisted
And I had to pick two winners with whom I will collaborate
So it was a plan that we did with YouTube
So there were two winners
One I picked Sanchit
One I picked Samreen
Young girl was doing some sketch videos
So we are watching Sanchit right now where he is
And the other one I think Samreen has a lot of millions of followers
And I remember we shot a video in the hotel room
After 2017
Thats a great statement
We shot a video in the hotel room
Amazing statement
How did you feel that time?
We shot a video
How did you feel?
It was very crazy
It was discussed in my entire college that Technical Guruji has made a video with
So it was crazy
It was a very crazy moment
In fact I also told in my JoshTalk that how Technical Guruji had a very big important
part in my life
I will always be thankful to him
Recently Carry Mena TV
Carry is younger brother
What is that?
What happened there?
It was so much fun
Lets have some fun
Let me show you something
Let me show you what Carry had messaged me
I think we spoke the day before yesterday We spoke
the day before yesterday
One second
See this
Let me show you
When Carry uploaded it he said Hello Sir
I made a small parody of yours
I hope I was able to get close to your character and you dont take negative
Really enjoyed playing your character and got to learn a lot
He sent me the link of the video
I was on a flight at that time
I replied to him
Hello brother
How are you?
I just saw the video
I was on a flight
I was coming from New York
I was changing my flight
I was sitting in the lounge and everyone was laughing
I was wearing a laptop
It was solid
It must have taken a lot of effort
Carry is saying Thank you so much
It means a lot
We are having fun
When the iPhone 15 was launched we planned something together again
But at that time I was traveling and you couldnt shoot
The thing is there are two things
If someone is really attacking you for no reason other than
just to bring you down its a different side altogether
In Carrys case we are people from the community
At that time I say see how he is how he is
how I am
Its fun
So the parody he made I mean I am seeing attention to
detail in all the characters
And people have liked my character the most
I am enjoying it
Any thoughts Shlok on roasting?
I also align with the same thing that there are two types
of criticism
One is where there is no meaning to it and they just want
to bring you down
And sometimes there is a way where either people are making fun of us or we have done
something wrong
So a consumer or a viewer may get angry
They may abuse in anger
But it is our job to understand that whether he is trying
to forcefully insult us or he has a problem and he is commenting on us
So I think like in the case of Carry
The good thing about Carry is that I dont know about
I mean if I call him now he will say hello brother how
are you?
He has that image
What you see on camera and what you get behind the camera is a very different thing
Yesterday or day before yesterday I did a reel post on Instagram
Vishal the guy who wrote Carrys sketch
Deepak told me yesterday that he forwarded it to the group
And he tells Vishal that you should take the writing fees from Gaurav
He is also using your dialogue
He is having fun
Now even with IBTR till now there will be so many preconceived notions in peoples
Immediately after looking at this it is going to change
Because behind the camera a lot of things are different
A lot of things are said in front of the camera
Even between tech YouTubers
But actually they might be very good friends and it might be planned
Or it might be said that I am going to talk about this
Before going ahead lets talk and do it
Can I say a small thing?
Its a very small thing
I mean I tell you
If you all align with Shahid I am telling you what I think
This YouTube is a new thing
Its a very new thing
And if you look very carefully at your deep inside it is a
very lonely journey
I mean if I go to my friend I tell him that I didnt get
so many views today
This topic was made
I was talking on AI
People didnt like it
Someone will understand a little
If I talk to you talk to Shlok talk to Gaurav talk to
You will immediately understand that this was your shortcoming
If we do the same work a little closeness
So when there are talks it makes you feel a little relaxed
It doesnt make you feel a little lonely
So I think that in fact not only on the collaboration camera
We should also talk to each other
Because you dont know right now
We have no idea what are the side effects of YouTube
You are so new
So I feel that there is still a lonely journey of tech YouTubers
I feel so
Not tech but any creator
Any creator
Actually there are side effects
I mean we saw what Lilly Singh was also going through and everything
So thats there
You guys also went through some sort of controversies right?
Oh yeah yeah
I was hoping for the next question
No no I didnt know
No I addressed it
Its okay
No no there are a lot
Yeah its the same
Oh sorry
No I didnt know that either
No no yeah
The thing is like you mentioned there are two types of trolls
One is obviously in a fun way that CarryMinati has done
Which is his job
Which he does
And the second is to bring someone down
So what happened with us is that each one of us were working with a certain brand
And we were working with them for such a long time
It was quite clear
Entire tech community was working with them
But one tech content creator did not get to work with that brand
And that pissed that person off
Because of that he wanted to retaliate in some way or the other
We just caught in the crossfire
And it happened that a lot of negativity that came from that video completely shattered
Im not lying
We were completely devastated
We were thinking what did we do wrong?
Because that was what was happening the entire time
And so it happened
And then we thought what should we do?
And we did make a video
But later we realized that we shouldnt have
You shouldnt have
I also I generally dont see videos
That time I had seen that
And I dont
And the best part to let go this is that you should like I
was talking with Sanchit off camera some time ago that if everyone is working on their
own and minding their own business so the other person should not get in the way to
bring someone else down
Because at the end of the day we all have a different
style of working
I might not agree with anyone elses style but that is
their style
I dont get in their way
Similarly I do not want someone else to get in our way
So that has happened with us at that time
So those 345 months whatever they were that was one of the worst periods of our YouTube
And like Sanchit just mentioned YouTube is very lonely
And I couldnt share that problem or discuss it with anyone
No one would understand
And obviously I cant be able to I wont be able to
discuss it with fellow YouTubers as well
Because we dont interact that regularly
We dont interact
It was a lesson learned that whenever something like that happens dont take any action
Just go on and mind your own business because that will be useful and that worked for us
But I think one of the most important things if you notice
all the people who have spoken so far everybody has at the end of it said there was a lesson
I think trolls negativity absolutely agree there are two types of negativity but I think
the comment section is your greatest learning tool
Enemy also
Koi aur nahi aayega aapko guide karne ke liye better because as you said kabhi galti ho
jaye and the people flame you for it you learn from it and become better
He is six months down the line he is a much better where they have gone after the lesson
they have learned
Wo jo ek aapka six months of loneliness tha at maybe your worst period but see where
you are today
Most of it will come from that six month journey
Kitni learning thi kitna lesson tha
You never fail you either learn or you win
I think this is a very important thing
Its not that never fail a lot of times there are
instances where things like this have happened
The channel has gone down views have gone down and the key going down and it never comes
Aise hua hai
Either thing is Ill tell you honestly ignore kar do
that is the best
If someones trying to pull you down it simply means you stand above them
Yeah yeah
Youre important enough for them to want to pull you down
My point was ek bar wo jane ke baad how do you come up especially for an established
Ek baat sunna hai Devendra yeh cheez hui wo phase nikla lets say kal yeh cheez dubara
ho jati hai now you are in a better position to deal
Much better yes
Toh ek baar ka experience tha but now its a learning for
a lifetime
Toh I think jo agar sunn raha hai koi isko abhi jisne wo sakta hai aaj tak yeh phase
nahi kiye hai toh usko already pata hai ki kya karne kyuki hamare experiences hain
Toh I think ignore karo side nikalo aagey badho thats
the best way out
And thats the learning jo idhar se idhar se aari hai
Jaise abhi aapne bola ki jab itna phase down jata hai toh usse bahar kaise nikalna hai
Toh ek simple sa funda hai jo ham apne 1012 saal ki journey mein apply kara hai hamne
and that is always go back to the basics
We just go back to the basics
If you go back to what you were doing and jis cheez ke liye aapko logon ne they have
given you the love you go back to that again do it better with the learning
I think Arun you come back
But Ill tell you again yeh jo basics hai na yeh basics
bhi because of algorithm change hote rehte hai and I dont know how many will understand
this but YouTube pe jo 656 saal chal raha tha basics ki yeh yeh aapne karna chahiye
wo agar abhi aap apply karte ho videos ko your videos
will not work
But Arun Ill tell you the reasons why
Because wo basics ho gaye alag because everyone else has probably gone up wo basics abhi
basics rahe nahi basics have gone to a different level
So according to me you have to keep evolving and understanding
But thats the basics
That is true
Understanding is the basics
I am not saying ki jo basics jaise aap kar rehte hai waise
hi karte hoon
Pehle hum text karte the phir hum videos pe aaye uss time jab hum videos pe aaye
kuch content creation influencer kuch bhi nahi tha
We just did it because humein laga ki kuch gap hai jo hum fill kar sakte hain
So we tried we wanted to do different kind of videos and that worked for us
So our basics was to always evolve like he said ki evolve to karne hi padega ab short
videos agar aa rahe hain agar aap short videos nahi banaoge that means you are harming yourself
Usse kisi ka kuch fayada nahi hone wala ki aap ussi pe gogi nahi mai to long videos
hi banaunga kyuki mere ko to long videos hi banaane aate hain
Short videos is not my thing
That is not my thing
Pivoting is part of being
So basics is that you should always be with the trend
Kahi baar agar ahead of the trend ho toh toh sab sahchi baat hai
Be the disruptor or you will be disrupted is a basic
And I think Shlok what Shlok has done with the overlays I think he is with the curve
ahead of the curve I must say
Jo next category after content hai that is definitely
product and he has built a really nice product
Or not one multiple products
Toh wo ek jacket hai
Yeh jacket kisi ki hai yaar?
Yeh badhi achi jacket hai
Badhi achi jacket hai
Yeh monetization mein ecommerce thats also going to be huge right?
I was coming to this like how do you see it
as a business?
I think this is a great topic even I am going to get into
Main apna waise is pehle purane wale topic mein apna opinion deta hu
Kyuki I feel ki sometimes ignoring is not enough
Kyuki mereko aisa rakhta hai ki market mein jo cheez jada boli jaati ho sach ban jaati
toh agar ek banda kuch bol raha hai and wo das bandon ko inspire kar deta wo same cheez
bolne ke liye toh cheez sach ban jaati agar saamne ala banda reply na kare
Mere kyaal se Off camera hai
Yeh hi wali baat mein abhi aapko bolna chahata jab baaki log bol rahe the ignore ka I completely
agree with you
Mere zaap se theek hai agar matlab it does not make sense aur koi usko wo nahi dera hai
tawajjo nahi dera hai toh it is okay
But agar if it I see it becoming a thing and mereko lagta
hai ki nahi yeh galat hai toh main toh fight karne ke liye ready main apna stand lene
ke liye main laddi pe chal rahe ho
Aap gali mein chal rahe ho aur kuttey aapko attack kar rahe hain ek tarika yeh ki aap
ruk ke her ek pe patthar pekhoge patthar katham ho jayenge suratdarbaad
ho sakta hai aur kuttey bhadte ja rahe hain second option is aap unko biscuit fekho toh
kuttey aap ke beeche pooch laate bheyenge toh my thing is ki agar aap ignore na karo
aur agar aap jawaab dere ho toh bhai thats what they want they want more attention
thats what they want toh wo cycle ban jayega ek hai ki kutton ko jawaab dena
ek hai ki jo actual reality hai wo logon wo dikhana bhai
but wo kab tak karoge wo toh batao but mere kya se at the end toh ignore karna hi padega
at the end toh ignore karna padega but did you answer to the guy who had I remember
this story I dont know how many people remember but jab
ecommerce brand launch ki layers launch kiya tha wo coding ka arre
na aapko simple 3 baat main flight pe tha and you asked me ki maine reply karna chahiye
ya nahi we were going to US or somewhere at that
time na wo simple story azaat hoon ek hua gaya hum website bana rahe the website mein
mockups hote hain sari cheezon hote hain wo publicly available hota hain and
code jo hai aap google ka code copy karo koi aapko kuch bolega nahi kyu hi it is
not copyrighted ya koi ispe patent attendant toh laga nahi humne ek developer hire raha
tha usne halka halka code idhar udhar utha liya and ek jo competitor tha kyu hi hum
market mein agar ghus rahe hain skins ki hum market mein jaa rahe hain toh
of course jo pehle jo competitor uski market jaayegi toh
wo humko bhai publicly aake ki haan yeh kar diya yeh copy karta yeh karta wo karta
hai manager wo theek hai bhai haan hogi hogi galti theek hai koi baat nahi but uske
baad like wo humare upar ek legal notice bhai ne vej diya maine
poore check kar waha hai ki bhai yeh isme kya hai yeh
toh basic cheez
hain mockup toh publicly available hota hain sari cheez hain aisa kuch it is not it is
legally okay to do it yaar Instagram ne bhi
toh stories copy kari hain humne aisa kuch khaas copy nahi kar raha tha humne website
bhi change kar di thi but uske baad we filed ek humne wapas legal notice bheja ki hum
defamation file karenge agar aap jo aap cheez kar raho publicly kar raho
uske baad then he stopped kyunki usko bataegi usko jisko actual solution chahiye hota hai
na wo publicly halla nahi bachaata and mereko wo cheez bhagi ki of course yaar aap kahin
bhi kisi market aap jaoge log peeche kheechne aa jaate hain toh
it depends ki kab reply karna hai kab nahin karna hai so
you replied basically and you took it forward and ab wo
uska kaam ban chuke wo baar baar kuch kuch naya lata rhta hai main dekhta rhta hoon
usko maza aa gaya aise hi humein but even I only
feel like you have to give a reply because we dont have to bottle up our mental health
also because yaar taste wise taste wise agar wo nahi if he does no I myself roster
companies so I he is doing it hot I do skits based on
you know what are the no he is way of thinking its a controller
yeh bahut difficult to understand ki troll ne sach bola hai mere baare mein galat ya
phir wo faalto bol raha hai agar aap realize kar gaye apni mistake toh shayad wo aapki
sabse greatest learning ho
gaye aap curve hi badal raha hai but I agree with Gaurav ki like bhai at the end toh ignore
karna hi padega na haan haan mada otherwise it is going to affect you lets go back to
the question that we are all waiting for what you are doing journey
kaise hai ecommerce if its the big one do you believe that does it take you away
from your core sabse bada question hi hai ki jo jis cheez ne aapko banaya hai kya
usmein ab aap utna hi passion aur time daal par rahe ho content creator?
It mere kya haal se toh 100 it is the future
100 ek product ko agar aap distribution jo mada hum essentially videos bana rahe hain
hum sab log agar aap ek accha product ek aise cheez aap le aao jo aapki audience isme
interested hai it is a billion dollar business I am main usko bilkul kam
nahi kar raha agar audience fit sahi hai jaise
I have talked to physics wala he has built a billion
dollar business Unacademy ke founders bhi start unhoni YouTube se kar raha tha kaafi
saari India mein log hai jino ne business banaya hai YouTube ko leke
bas mere kya haal se dikkat hi ho jaati hai usually jab log start karte hain wo
product ko for granted le leta hai unko lagta hai ki manlab
We can make a product and the audience will buy it
I think to build that product whether its a physics
product or my own reference it took us 3 years to make a skin
It took us 3 years to learn clothes
I have a whole industry to learn
And if I remove the layers from TechBurner because there
is no distribution of TechBurner but layers in itself no
one else in the market is able to beat that product
I am saying globally
No one else is able to make a product like that
Same thing that we are making in clothing HM Zara all the international brands the
price point at which we are making jackets no one is able
to make it
So I think if the product is good then it becomes easy to leverage that thing
But the reputation you have made what you do today the
way you have got love from people credibility from people when you make a product and your
jacket goes out have you not got criticism that it has become commercial?
Number 2 now you are not making yourself vulnerable that people will start saying
I bought a jacket it turned out to be useless my button
came off
I am not saying this is the truth I am saying I keep getting asked this question
Is this vulnerability in your mind at the back of your
I mean when things are going on so publicly and
negativity spreads more quickly
Now if there is a slight delay in delivery if it is of
one person then it will create more noise
The thousands of happy customers lakhs of happy customers
they just put up a photo and stay happy
But negativity spreads
But in our case because the audience showed so much trust this has not happened
There was a very positive response
And I am personally very happy
And I feel very grateful that our community shows so much love
But in my opinion it is obviously your intention
If it is your intention to provide genuine value then the customer in front of you feels
So there is no problem in that
How do you change your audience into a community?
This will be very important
Because there is an audience that watches your videos and there is an audience that
will buy your clothes
So how do you change that?
Or you know how do you build a community in general?
Even BBomb has done it
How do you build a community?
In my opinion there is no rocket science
In my opinion the product is very simple
If you show it well it will sell well
But I will actually call it the opposite
That I felt that when I didnt start this brand that if I
do a promotion then I am selling to the audience of Techburner
They will feel weird
This is my question
But it was the opposite
When we built our product we shared the whole story people got more connected with us
That this guy is doing something he is trying something
And the more we share that we are doing this we are
doing this we are doing all these things we are planning this people get more attracted
And I didnt expect this
I thought it was the opposite
That if we sell people will go away
It has become very commercial
But when we started showing people started coming closer
More people came
And this happens every time
I mean whenever we share our story of layers of
overlays people get more connected
Maybe it is an inspiration
Maybe they see that we are working hard
We are just selling to earn money
But I dont know what it is
But I try that our products that we are making are strong
And your time management are you still being able to put
in the same amount of time that you used to do before in content creation for Techburner?
This is not possible
For a lot of people thats whats missing
I think for everyone
I mean we all work so hard
You are also running so many businesses
We all do different things
And everyone has less time
But earlier I wasnt able to give that much time
Earlier I was a beggar
But there is a difference
Earlier the optimization was not that good
Now things are optimized
I think with time we used to do it in 8 hours
Now we can do it in 1 hour
So if we have 1 hour today its enough for the earlier editing comparison
I think thats done over time
Here its also about team building
You have to build teams also
Thats the most crucial part
I mean I think its your role now to build the best
That also reduces loneliness
Team building reduces a lot of loneliness which I felt
Over time
I dont feel lonely at all
I because it is a onterm journey
I feel I might be alone but I am not lonely
I enjoy it
I am alone but I dont have a problem with being alone
I think community building if it happens community is built then it happens for a
short time
Lets say 5 years 6 years
I feel community is a fear
Like I have a selfopinion
I have made a new theory
Maybe I am wrong
I am learning
I think I have made a new theory
It happened after a while
It faded
A legacy what does it do?
It works quietly
I mean I am working
I am doing the same work
I am improving
Its been many years
Come see go
Bro I will give you an example for content creators
Our audience every year people move away from it
The one who was watching us till yesterday he got a job
He is not watching you now
He was in college
He was watching you
And the new guy who got a new phone he will start watching you
So the crop will always it wont be like its been 10 years and he is watching you
since day 1
And if it is like that then his interest may be earlier
it was more
Now he watches you sometimes
What is the difference?
So the crop will always come out and the new crop will come
But what is the difference in what you said?
When you build a community that is a term
And a legacy it eventually comes to the legacy is about community
So what is the difference?
I wish I could name drop a bit but I wont do that
For obvious reasons
I have seen those who have cult following after a time just as a general statement
I am giving someones name lets talk about vloggers
He had a community
Means I will say this if he said today at 12
I am coming here India Gate everyone comes
But over time that cult following goes like this
But if there is a vlogger who is doing his work quietly
and like this means he is not doing community community he is not giving a name
So I have just noticed that the line of the creator
May be I am wrong
But I feel that he is banning his followers in such a
way that do more community community cult following happens
But you are right about one thing till date in history
you from the time humanity has come
This is absolutely right
Cult following its called a cult because it is for a
period of time
There is no such thing as cult following forever
According to me two things like I was listening to everyone so there are two types of people
one type of people who know you and one type of people who want to become like you
So like when a person is young or a child so may be
he wants to become like you
When he grows up then he realizes no I dont want to become like him
I want to become like Shahrukh Khan
Or I want to become like someone else
So the people who
So the people who want to become like you or the things you are doing they want to
do something like that that is your actual follower base community
or cult whatever you want to call it
And the people who know you okay they know you but may be they want to watch your
videos sometimes
So I personally look at it by dividing it into these
If you are doing something different something strong then there is a question here this
community is it same for YouTube also for social media is it the same?
I mean Instagram Facebook everything is different
Everything is different
In fact I also want to ask because we have
Rajivji here you know as a medium you have been on every platform including TV
YouTube social media social media you are doing very very well
How is it different working with community?
I mean how do you build a community on each platform?
Is it different or is it the same?
No actually there is a lot of difference
First example the same person who follows you on YouTube and who follows you on Instagram
he comes with a completely different psychology when he opens Instagram and when he comes
to watch you on YouTube
It could be the same person but he comes with a very
different psychology of what he what he wants to consume on a different platform
When he turns on the TV with what mindset did he turn it on?
When he turns on the radio and he is going home from office to you know somewhere
This community expectation from the same person he can have four different expectations
from you
Number one I think this is a very important realization
for all of us but more important for all those people
who will now come up
That you dont think that your YouTube following has
become very good
So you will go on Instagram even if you have pivoted
very well but the person is not expecting you to do the
same thing
You know you open Instagram you want immediately you may have only one one and a half minutes
you want either just entertainment you want your mind to
be you didnt search for it it was delivered to you
I will also add a secret to this that I like I also when
I go one day I went to the bank I was at work
So I met a girl there she took a selfie with me and all
that And she didnt even know what a tech burner
is She didnt even know that I make long videos
She just saw my video on Facebook And the 3minute video that we cut and put
on Facebook She just saw that video
And then I went and checked That our Facebook audience
The YouTube Shorts audience The YouTube audience
The Instagram audience All of them are 60 different 60 audience
is different everywhere And a lot of people dont even know that we
make long videos A lot of people dont even know that we do tech reviews
A lot of people think that I just upload photos It is like that
You have to have a longformat video Even for Shorts and for Reel
You cant just put whatever you made for the Reel
You have to put a little short If you take for granted a platforms community
or following You will not be able to build anything ever again
So Arun the answer to this thing is that Community building is per platform
It is not If I take my TV audience
It will definitely come It will get some initial momentum
Because people are like I have seen this on TV
But the rest of it Has to be organically built
And it is for that platform only Right As an entire
I have so many platforms I dont use the word community Which platform
Gaurav Which platform do you think is more relevant
Or probably the platform of the future Next What is the next big thing
Lets hear it from everybody Lets start from Arun
Whats the next big thing?
Reels is going to be the big thing for me
Its been 3 years
It will continue
It will continue for sure
Because they are already working on EIS and a lot of stuff
So it will continue
I think Instagram Reel is doing pretty well right now
But I dont see it as a longterm thing
I think people will get bored eventually
But we dont know when that will happen
Lets hope it doesnt happen
We are working so hard
But yes next
Ill answer
I think the next big thing is going to be Metaverse
And that is what I believe
Something big is going to happen
But it will take time
Its not like it will happen tomorrow or the next year
YouTube Shorts will coexist
But yes one thing that I see as a platform is that the shoppable experience social commerce
will increase with the help of Shorts with the help of Reels
And Im seeing that as of now there are links in the description
So TikTok has been testing this in other countries
As soon as I wear a Tshirt or an overlay coat on the
video if I tap on it from there only I can buy anything
You know you actually answered the next big thing already
So take it back
That without it looking like it is commercial ecommerce great content without making
you say buy this do this you will have to do it organically
But that is where the future really lies
Id love to hear from you
MetaQuest I dont think its going to take long
Even I in three to four years
How many of us have used MetaQuest 3?
If you use it you immediately come to know that is what is going to really appeal to
the audiences in coming two three years
Photos are still messy
So not a lot of people
Who does all this mess?
You can see the potential
I disagree
I was taught as a kid to sit a little further away and
watch TV
The small TV 30inch TV sit a little further away and
watch it
A small 30inch TV
What is a 21inch TV?
I had a 21inch TV
You know the eyes are here
4K 4K two TVs with the eyes here
Put the headset on and watch
I dont find it healthy
Its a matter of health too
See again this is the difference between Gen X Gen Y Millennials
The people who are 12 13 14 15 16 17 years old have these two
They will be on it all the time
Because you dont have that baggage
I dont think its healthy
Its healthy
Thats a different topic altogether
AI is it healthy or unhealthy?
Its different
Im saying that there has been a lot of testing even for
you know beyond Gen Z also
The thing that is humanly very awkward no one does it
Why do 3D glasses fail?
Why do people not want to watch 3D movies?
Even in the cinema hall we dont
To strap on something to keep something on that is not generational
But everybody is expecting the Apple Vision Pro to change things
I completely disagree
I feel that it will be the biggest failure for Apple
I used PS VR to make that video in 25 days
I vomited three times to make that video
Thats what Im saying
Ive been doing it since then
Youre using it while youre standing and moving
Its a different thing
If youre watching a movie while sitting its a different thing
If you are moving content around you is moving
For example FPV drones you cant fly it while standing
A FPV drone pilot will always fly it while sitting
Because if he flies it while standing he can see that Im flying
He cant feel the gravity
So theres a disconnect
Its the same thing
But if you do it while sitting its a different thing
Theres a test Im talking about for 12 to 15 year olds
95 of them said after 15 minutes
The wow factor
Oh my God!
The world Ive gone into
After 15 to 20 minutes would you buy it?
Would you want to do it again?
94 said no
But the harsh reality is whether you like it or not there will be a change in the future
But is this the future?
Is this the future?
Its not in perfect form
Please understand
Its in its third generation
It will be much easier
Youll be wearing glasses
You remember the Google Glass?
It was back in 20112012
I think something will happen
If it comes in contact lenses I see a future
I think it makes reality happen
Vision Pro
And even nowadays like the iPhone is coming up with special videos
I feel Apple I dont know if they have a plan but what
if theyve come up with a different platform where you can load special videos so that
it will be more lively
Maybe thats something which can be looked at
Youll still have to wear it
Yeah but maybe like what Guruji said what if its like a glass?
Eventually it will go that way
It cant be that big
It cannot carry that
I remember my first VR experience
It was with Samsung S7
When S7 and S7 Edge came the Galaxy VR where you had to put your phone
The phone had a quad HD screen
So comparatively it used to be sharp
And at that time it had all those different theater modes
that it will create a virtual theater
I think it was in 2016
It was fun
And today when I tried Apple Vision Pro in June
I had a 45 minutes indepth session
It was night and day
I mean theres no comparison from any VR to Apple VR
Google Cardboard to Apple VR
Google Cardboard where your phone is connected
The phones used to be so big
And today theyre folding
Basically things will change in the future
It would be like a normal glass
This has a camera
This has a speaker
In this youll see the position and everything
Were going to move forward with smartphones
Whether its 5 or 10 years from now
What is the one future tech that you are seeing future in?
I mean AI
Variable technologies
Humane kind of things
Maybe you
I dont think its a replacement for a smartphone
Thats very clear
You know the next big thing can be but its not a replacement for a smartphone
Were talking about two completely different devices right?
Even though I did a video on Instagram
The death of the smartphone
Got millions of views
I showed it to Humayun
But the point of it is that if you are really really
truthful thats not a smartphone replacement
No but sir eventually what my opinion here is today we have a mobile phone that does
all our work
At one time we needed a calculator
We needed Walkman
Digital cameras
Multiple things
Today phone is capable to do everything
166 standalone devices replaced by a smartphone
So phone is the hub
When we go to a brands presentation they always show their chart
This this this
Phone is in the center
Four things
Smartwatch this this
This is the thing
Today the phone is capable to do everything
But if you dont have a phone you forgot your house then you are handicapped
You cant do anything
So this still is a hassle that I have to carry this device with me
If I dont have this then Im nothing
I have to charge this
I have to see this
The future would be where we can replace this with something that is in me
Or with me altogether
You guys are like into things going inside your body?
Not at all
It can be a chip
No no
I would not prefer that
But but
Put it nicely
You know
Those are not called wearables
They are called insertables
And just by the name itself I think its weird
I dont want an insertable in me
I mean maybe a smart band that Im wearing
Projecting things
Or a glass or something
I mean eventually something that is with me
I mean without even me having to think about whether Im keeping it or not
It is part of me
And it will happen
Im with him
We dont have to carry the tech
In this I have a challenge
Right now the biggest problem is that if I have an image in my mind or if I have some
information in my mind if I want to put it in my mobile then I just have fingers
I will have to type with my fingers or I can speak with my
I think the next big thing that will come because I have the same problem with the watch
I have the same problem with the eyeglasses
I think the next big thing that will come is that its a little weird to put a chip
in the brain
But there are such technologies that have come now
Neuralink has also come
There are a few more things
Which directly interact with our brain
Im telling you
Think of an example
We have smart homes now
Alexa is on
Light is connected
I will tell it
Alexa turn on the light
Its a good thing
But still I have to say the best would be that I just have to think that
I think thats the future
It will happen in 10 years
In 10 years
We are ready for that
It has to happen
And this is a possibility
In medical terms I think nanotech and everything will be better
But I feel something which is connecting
A part of a tech connecting our brain cells
I mean I disagree with that
Maybe that might be the future
I think that will be the future
The voice will be better
This that everything
There will be telepathy 100
Thats what I was expecting
So think about it
I will send you a love letter
Not having to carry the tech is what we are going towards
This is going to happen
And one thing I also feel like the way AI is coming and right now
we are simply using the generative AI to help our daytoday tasks
But in the future I think maybe if smartphone companies are able to implement it nicely
then everyone would have a personal assistant of their own tuned to their habits
their tasks everything
And its possible that in 2024 AI could be a big buzzword or marketing term for smartphones
to come
2023 was the buzzword and marketing term for AI
2024 will be the result of that
I think so far the person who is using AI yes its great that this person is right
But in 20242025 the job of the person who is not using AI will go
It will go 100
And this means that AI will become a need
And at this time it is so powerful I can show you a video
But what exactly are we supposed to catch up with AI?
I think everything will be replaced
Every single thing
What is the thing which we have to catch up?
At least get to know how to use AI
But why?
You need to be in the But why do we need to walk to AI?
There are people So that to you okay
You said but why?
If you are using AI you are able to do what you do right now
Youll be able to do it 10x better 10x faster
But if you are not then like he was saying next year the person who is doing it will
be 10x better and 10x faster than you and youll be left way behind
But what exactly are we looking at?
Ill show you one thing
Its a tool that can be used No see thats the whole point is that if
you start saying which tool?
You look See this thing is not going out only to us
content creators out here
Its going out to the rest of the world
Here many different people will come from different professions
The point is not which
The point is what do you do and which AI is applicable to you?
When you wake up in the morning and you go to sleep at night you do 78 core tasks every
day right?
Out of those 78 core tasks how many can now help with AI?
From imagination to your thinking to your scripting to coming up with an idea
But like I said that scripting part is like its some
A computer is generating that idea for you
Im not saying its perfect right now
But its not perfect
But thats not the point
Computers are generating ideas
How is it doing?
Large language models basically they are trained to think like humans
So the way we have got education the computers have been trained they have been given large
data set
But do you think that the time will take Let me tell you an interesting thing
It will be clear to you
When humans heard about fridge for the first time all the industries thought make a fridge
There is money in it
It will be in everyones house
The one who earned the most money was the one who had cold beverages
CocaCola Maza
The one who used that fridge cooled it down and put it
back in its place
So AI is that thing
AI is a fridge
The one who will use AI to make tools that will work
The second part which is a layer up that AI needs a lot
of data
So I am telling you the biggest companies in the future
will be more rich will have more data and crazy things
will come out
This is a reality which we should understand
Even we dont know what AI is going to be
We can only talk but AI is that fridge from which we
dont know what byproduct is going to come out
This is a fact
Now will you keep a cake or a drink in that fridge or a
healthy salad?
That is on you
Or maybe beer
According to me AI will change the entire content industry
We wont have to make videos
And it is possible I will show you one video
And This video
This is 100 AI
Neither is it my voice nor is it my video
nor have I written the script
All these things are AI and it is possible right now
And I am telling you right now I just have to input my face into a software
and it will make a video for me
I have a friend Varun Maya
He has an AI page and 70 of the videos are AI
And people dont even know
People dont even know that he is talking about AI
The voice is also mapped the person is also mapped
I am telling you if this is happening right now 100 years from now what will happen
after 5 years?
What is the end game of this?
What will happen after this?
What are we supposed to do?
If you dont have to do anything
Yeah what are we supposed to do?
But sir raw conversations wont survive like this
Point of view
Now AI is trained on large data sets
They dont have emotions
There is no emotional intelligence
Creativity emotional intelligence that humans and they bring perspectives
Like what we are discussing right now everyone has a different perspective
AI it has been trained on large data
It is a data set
There are no emotions
And most of our decisions which we make are emotionally done
At least 30 40 50
But you can bring a lot of that emotion with the prompts that you choose
So now when we are talking about video when we pick it up the emotion that we feel that
AI can never give
Thats why your personal point of view will always be important
I think AI so just I got to know yesterday there is an AI
named Delpy
So what it does is it analyzes all your Twitter all your Facebook ID whatever the data you
put on in your mind
Because the same thing whatever you have said so far personally
In your point of view it analyzes everything and it is available 24x7
It replies to the comments or it replies to the tweet of
our audience in such a way that we used to do that
You know Arun you can give a prompt saying that if we give this phone to Arun Prabhu
Desai what would be his first six emotional reactions?
And you will be very surprised it will be the same six
So I can quiz you at that time
I will ask you six questions from your AI generative model then I will ask you five
of them will be the same thing
Let me tell you this again in fact goes to prove my
What you put on social media on Twitter is it what you
You put your what you want others to see about you
Not you in particular
You are talking about that only
You will put AI outside only
Most of the time online
You will put AI outside
But see like I said the data is still being collected
And it is going to collect for another five so I think it
will get perfect
Another five years
Its like I would give an example that AI is like a
Whatever you teach that child it will learn
And you teach it that if someone abuses you you should get angry
Or if this happens you should do this
Like we teach a child to walk to get angry to eat this
not to eat this
You can teach the same thing to AI
It takes ten years to teach to a child and five minutes to teach to AI
You scan a PDF of the whole book and send it to it to read it and deliver it to me
And that book learns it
And you give that photography book to the AI chart board and that photography will
learn it
You tell it to generate a photo it will do it
So if we basically what AI is whatever data you feed it
it does it
You cannot feed emotions
I am saying that too
Its emotions are different
Yours are different
Mine are different
Because that has come from how we have been brought up
Our experiences as a whole that the people who are sitting now mine every person sitting
here today my thought process is different
You thinking about everyone else is different
It cannot be the same
It is with the individual
And you cannot teach that to AI
But Arun your question you are seeing this you are now putting two different things together
Your personal life and the life that you have outside
We were talking about can we make a video
No I was talking about emotions
Can you make a video that is completely trained like he is speaking completely trained on
every single thing you have ever output to the world
Not personal not what you are thinking of us right now
Whatever you have shown your personality outward to the public till date that can be trained
I am giving you this guarantee that if you will say after
that training that Arun is sitting here and we have asked your training six questions
What would be your six emotional reactions for the public?
They will be pretty accurate
Then my question is do you have to promote such a thing?
No it is not about what we are promoting or not
It is going to be there
See he said like about the AI tool but if this is the
thing like if it can generate the emotion or it can
replicate what you are outward persona
Personality your personality
There is a big difference between generating emotion and outward persona
How can it have that emotional intelligence?
It might take
The emotional connect might take some time
Maybe it takes
But who is going to get emotional intelligence?
It might take some time
See how do you get emotional intelligence from outside?
What is important is what you are going to get emotional intelligence from?
You might get emotional intelligence from How are you going to feed your emotional intelligence
which you have built over the last 2030 years with experience?
Even with the AI There is a whole field called psychiatry
That is also part of AI right?
And what you are talking about that is our formative
years my 2030 years as a human being
But that formative years is also part of psychiatry
This is a very very dense topic to get into
Yeah okay
Lets leave it at See I like the generative AI whatever we
are using at the camera processing and all those
That is fine that is harmless
But I am like thinking about what will be If you unlock this thing
Everyone is worried about it
Its just not you
Everyone is worried
Shloka is shown as just a deep fake very simple straight forward
I have shown it to you already
What about I have seen it somewhere else
But whatever is in the past And to talk about just the To do the deep
fake that he showed right now
Actually what a deep fake
Its like I have fed all the information in my body language where I move my hand like
this move like that give expressions like this
So I fed all the information and in a deep fake the face changes
This is my whole For instance there is a legal case of Bruce Willis
There was an advertisement of a Russian Vodka of Bruce Willis
You can all see it online
He never went to Russia
He never shot for it
His thing
Approximately 1000 hours of video was actually fed in
That he has a tick here
When he says this word his eye
moves like this
The whole thing was fed in
And the whole ad deep fake they have never paid him for it
It happened in Russia
Very dense legal thing
So that is And you know there are now contracts that are being given to people
in Hollywood
So this whole thing that is coming In every which way AI is coming faster than
you can respond to it
AI will take our job
I have full confidence
Like either it will be us who do it or it would be someone else
I think its like saying that which website will be popular
on the internet
Internet is the thing that is going on
So AI is the framework
Now which website which prompt which That is not the point
Because new ones will keep coming
New ones come every 2 weeks
So its like the framework you have to learn
By prompting I mean you learn to tell AI
Learn to talk to AI
Or feed AI what you want it to do
A lot of people have a problem with that
A lot of people are in English right now
Prompt engineering
How to get a job
There are I have seen and I have read about it
There are some people who put up an ebook with brilliant chat GPT prompts
And they have been making millions of dollars
Just by telling and teaching people how to use AI in a better way
If you know your prompts right you can get really good results
Sir give it to me
Give me the link
Sir I dont have it
Everyone thought that the lower level jobs AI will finish first
But the opposite happened
Creativity finished first
Its shocking
I spoke about this that day at that event
Its so shocking
And really we are at the red spot right now
There is a lot of investment in the lowest level
Because in that you need In the everyday mundane jobs you need robotics
to actually close that action
If you are a blue collar worker if you are making
There is a point
Did you see Teslas new robot video?
It is crazy
It is like an actual human
That balance panel
There is a coffee shop in Dubai
Something about that
In Dubai festival city
And it is not there since today
It has been there for the past 23 years
There is zero staff
Do you know what happens there?
You go
Its a huge platform
Its such a big platform
There is seating on the edges
You go and sit on the stool
There is an iPad in front
There is a menu
You order
You are ordering
You pay
In front there is a barista
He is a robotic arm
You can see the robotic arm in front
He opened it
He poured milk
He is doing all the human actions in the robotic arm
He will do everything
He placed his order on the tray in front
He knows that he has come to you
You drank coffee
You left
There is no one in the entire shop
There is a cashier
For that matter there is not a single person
So Gaurav look at its investment
Robotic arm and other things
But it is one time investment
Generating AI is only software building on more software
Sir it is very expensive
Sir it is needed for that too
But it is done for easy rounds
But it is easy
But an interesting thing that we can take out for the viewers
What we are talking about is for someone to start content creation now
You think you dont even need a studio
You sit in a chair at home
AI has made the studio
There is a camera
There is less light
AI has enhanced the light
There is noise in the voice
AI has removed that
So for someone to start the content creation journey today
Using all the AI tools
Yeah even I support that kind of AI
With one click Listen
So with one click With one click you have made captions
With one click your script is ready
So I think the struggle that we did
Anyone can be a creator
5 years 7 years ago
AI will be dubbed
That struggle has reduced today
If you are smart enough how to use AI
This could be a good thing
One more thing is clear
AI is the next big thing
We have talked so much about this
I have said this from the beginning
Always going to be AI
But AI will be the biggest thing
It will be smart
Okay guys
We have to take a break for 2 minutes
2 minutes
So it was a deep conversation actually
So lets come back to a little you know rooted topic
Something that we covered day in and day out
You know we ran on that
So how is 2023?
How is 2024 looking?
Have the prices become aggressive?
Are we going back to preCOVID days?
When you know shocking prices from POCO F1 were there
Are we going back to that?
That is not going to happen
Not going to happen?
But it seems like iQOO
With 12
The new 7 Pro that came
It was very creative
With iQOO 12 I feel again
That that part of it is starting to come again
Because if someone takes a brand lead
Others have to follow
And I think with hygiene coming into technology
Where everything is more or less becoming
You know very easy to put together
Or wow factors of smartphones have become lesser and lesser
I think price aggression will come back
Yeah because I feel the same
Because first of all smartphone adoption has plateaued
I mean there is no growth in the market
The 153 million peak that we took in 2019
That plateaued to like below that
And there has to be some sort of impetus
To rise right?
For the market
Basically you can never play on price
In a longer run
You can never do it in any business
If you think that I will become aggressive in price
And I will make the market
You cant make it
You will make it today
But it wont be long lasting
Biggest learning Xiaomi
Showed how aggressive it is
No one buys a Xiaomi phone for 25000
It doesnt sell
No one buys a Xiaomi phone for 70000
But you can be aggressive at each category right?
But I am just saying that
If we are aggressive at iQOO 12
iQOO 12 is good
But the problem is
iQOO 12 is selling a phone for 50000 today
Lets say they are very little margins
It is possible that they can take a loss
For some duration
Just to establish themselves
But they cant repeat it for 5 years now
So the price game can never run long
You cant wait for
Here I have a point
I am not talking about
Or having less price
Selling at a loss
I dont think so
The thing is
All the issues
Because of which
The smartphones price has had rocketed
They are gone
Those issues are resolved
But they were removed long back
It was till mid2022
It was oversupplied
Not oversupply
A lot of stock was left
And this particular time
They have removed it
All the stock
So a new stock will come
The issues
Earlier they used to demand more from outside
Now India is manufacturing
A lot of things which were there earlier
I think in the days of 2019
We will see such days
Without pricing
Its not one brand who will do it
I will tell you honestly
Just think through
Give a basic thought
We used to see a phone for 10000 or 15000
4 years back
And we used to think
We are getting so much in that phone
Dont know why
As customers
And even as ourselves
The standard rate of inflation
We also think
How can a mobile phone be for 10000 or 15000
We always want it to be for 10000
How can we get it?
Inflation is happening in the world
It is existing
What we are getting as an advantage is
The technology is getting better
At the same time
So we are getting some things at a lower price
But at the same time
Price will increase eventually
Everything is increasing
Biscuits are increasing
Water is increasing
Inflation is there
67 inflation
But technology has always been antiinflation
The laptops that used to come
And the exact laptops
I am not talking about the same specs
I am talking that same category
You are obviously getting it better
Because production improves
The overall quality of what you are doing improves
Economy of scale kicks in
I think its fine
The phone for 10000
You were getting 625
Now you are getting G85 G90
I am not talking about that
I am not talking that the price of the same spec comes
I am saying because technology improves
Becomes better
Do remember that
The amount of hardware that is made
You are seeing improvement in the phone
There is a lot of difference in their manufacturing
If you have an OLED TV
TV that comes in at a particular price point a much better
one will come at maybe 80 lower a little later
Because production and economy of scale became better
So when you are actually I am now predicting that in 2024
you are going to see a lot of the things that went wrong in COVID the oversupply
Why did the oversupply come?
They actually have invested far more now to get things done
So the actual advantage of that will go to consumers
You will get better products at a lower price in 2024
without undercutting
Ill ask a simple question
Tell me whats your answer
Samsung S24 Ultra is launching in January
If the world goes from one place to another can its price
be lower than the S23 series?
But when you talk about the highest flagship that is not
what is happening
But I am just saying
I mean when Apple Airpods 3 will come will it be cheaper
than Airpods 2?
No I have a question
I have a thing
Lets say we all are going to agree something like S23 is a good phone
Like this year we got a release
Do you think that someone can I mean with the software support and the performance
I am pretty sure that in 2025 S23 is a good phone
So if there is a chance that if that phone is available in
a very low price I think people can buy it right?
Yeah I mean
I mean technology is that
That is fine
But all I am saying is the reason for the price to go up
I mean the iPhone will start to be made in India
But if someone says that iPhone 16 is being made in India completely can its price be
lower than the current price of iPhone?
But both your examples are at the highest one
This is at the highest level but that is not really the
topic we are talking about
Alright alright alright
What we will do is a midrange normal phone okay which in the last year and in the last
year it was available for Rs 25000
Today you will get a better phone in every aspect whether it is display performance
You are going to get it for less than Rs 25000
Are you saying that we are not getting better phones
because you said that the price is going to increase
The price is increasing
If you are getting more phone for the same price even today
You will get more phone for less price is what we are saying
If the technology is enhanced then its obvious
If you compare the phone from 3 years ago with the phone from 3 years ago then its
also enhanced
No not that
We have seen that with time
In the beginning there was a fingerprint scanner in a phone for Rs 50000
Today you can get it in a phone for Rs 10000
You know whatever
So technology always trickles down
What brands do is if they are selling an expensive item they will earn all their maximum
profits and then they will introduce a lower tier variant of them
I dont understand what both of you are saying
Are you saying that phones are getting expensive?
He has something to say
I would say I would break it down
According to me the company that was trying to sell at a low price it doesnt have a
profit to experiment and make a new thing
Thats what you told me
You cant play for a long time at a price
I agree
You can play by reducing the price
But the market now is that you cant give better specs at a lower price
You have to do higher price better quality
I will give you something that you will immediately relate
The jacket you are wearing now maybe you bought this fabric from a Japanese supplier
Now the Japanese supplier you have he has invested maybe 1 billion dollars to make something
much better at a lower price
Much better
He has invested a lot
You will give that advantage to your customer right?
A better product at a lower price because you are being enabled to do it now
First of all someone should make it
No one can make it
And because we are making it by doing a lot of research
that is one of our incentives
Because in skins and everything else we have invested crores then we are able to make
Someone else has to make it he has to invest crores
I am talking about you
Your input this fabric you import from Japan that guy
that supplier has improved his production and material and he can now give it to you
at 10 lesser and it is 10 better
Now you will buy the product from him right?
But we wont reduce the price right?
Thats the thing
Because The market will go down
The market will go down
The customer will not get that advantage
We wont introduce that as a We wont introduce Overlace as a cheap brand
No we are going on a different topic
Its not about Its not about
Lets keep the atmosphere light
What do you think about bank offers?
What is your take?
One of the biggest game changers of 2023
Not bank offers the nocost EMI has been one of the biggest game changers of 2023
But it was there earlier also
No no now it is true nocost
Earlier it was a very fake one
They used to make mistakes in calculations
Today a lot of people come to me
They used to say you know tell me in 30000 rupees
Now peoples question has changed
And they say you know at a budget of 3000 rupees a month which is the phone to buy?
So the psychology of buying is changing
And that is a huge game changer
Huge game changer
Thats why iPhones have been sold a lot
Thats why
What an amazing scheme this is
No doubt there will be bank offers credit card offers nocost offers
I think all this has given a lot of benefit to India
In general
But let me throw one more question out
Because I find it very interesting that when I get replies back
In 2019 iPhone total market share was less than 1
It is approximately now at about 7
I mean if you show any other brand that they have increased 700 in 4 years
But where is the growth?
Is it in the Like this year did the iPhone 15 make this
growth happen?
Or is it the iPhone 11 and the 12?
Always last year
But Is that good for a brand?
But Okay
So I will tell you one thing
And I think you all will agree on this
The iPhone which has increased by 1 or 2 and has now gone up to 5 6 7
It will increase more
It can never decrease
I will tell you the reason for that
Everyone wanted an iPhone
Everyone wanted it
They were not able to buy it at one time
Or there was a barrier of starting price which was very high
Should I give a contradiction to this?
No listen to me once
Why did they want it?
Because someone else did not have it
Because it was a good phone
iPhone is a good phone
I mean iPhone is a good phone
There was also a reason that there was an exclusive thing
But sir we felt that it has sold a lot
Listen to me
But when you see tier 2 tier 3 that aspiration is still
It is still there
I am saying that it is still there
People who do not have it still want it
They want it
Every year we see that the price of old phones goes down
Old phones are still good for another 345 years
The way because the iPhones are made
And at the same time peoples salaries are increasing
People are changing new jobs
Money is coming into the market
So at the end they will buy the same thing which they
wanted to buy
So by doing this more new people are going to join in this
But there is no drastic change in technology also when it
comes to phones
Its just a big thing
See okay
I mean the latest ones which have been released
Today almost all the phones in the market they are good enough phones
There was a time when there were bad phones and good phones
Today for every phone if lets say not you are the
target someone else is the customer and they are happy
with those phones
iPhone is also good
Samsung is also good
All these are good phones today
So if you come to nitpicking you will find 15 shortcomings
in every phone
No one is perfect
But its a good phone
It gives you a good experience
And thats the reason people want to buy it
Because its a good phone at the end
Samsung is also good for that matter
No iPhone is more affordable now actually
So because of it because of it being So now lets paint a scenario that the aspiration
tier 2
tier 3 is because you have it I dont
I aspire to it
When iPhone will be in the 20 market what will be the aspiration?
Sir there is such a big market in the US it is still sold
Because the phone is good
But sir our population is very big
Dubai Dubai there is no carrier in Dubai
Take it it is sold there too
Basically let me tell you one thing
Lets say something is good genuinely good
If its market share is 80 then you will not stop buying
Thinking that its market share is 80 thats why you will stop buying it
No but its aspiration decreases
No but still you will
But the population is very big
I am not Listen if in India Apple has got 20 then
they will be in trouble
Sir it will happen
It will happen
You will get 20 soon
You wont get it today you will get it after 2 years
But I agree to what he said
There was a time when people used to see Apple as a very
premium product
We wanted to acquire it
But now the thing is that lets say everyone has it
But everyone has the access to buy the phone
So I feel the market is more like you know people that have a midrange phone
They are the ones who are going to look up to all these flagship phones
I actually did a reel on this exact emotion where earlier 5 years back if you bought
an iPhone or if you are using it everyone is looking at you
And then It was quite funny I saw it
But the point is that is actually happening
But still I also agree that the iPhone sales will increase
No I am not saying that it will increase
I am saying that it will increase by 1015
I said that if there is a good product in the market and we all use it will I stop
using it just because But its wow factor will decrease
Sir it doesnt matter
The wow factor of the phone is never less
I feel We made it
No sir we made it
They want to say something for the longest time
One of the benefits of the iPhone is that lets say we are using any iPhone for 2 years
its resale value is much better compared to any other Android phone
And in the Indian market that is very important
That is very important
But why is it so?
For the same aspirational reason because Okay what you can afford the other person
Because till date as sir has mentioned buying an iPhone was an aspiration for many people
So there is a scarcity in the market of seeing an iPhone
Now everyone is using the iPhone
Do you see 2024 or 2025 iPhone will have the same resale value as before?
There is a huge room for growth I think
There is a huge business now which is refurbished
And already in the refurbished market iPhones prices have dramatically dropped
Second thing in this Diwali there is also you know
there is all these analysts that work now
A very interesting thing came out through these analysts in corporate the most wow
thing to give to somebody big corporates like someone is working with a huge company
they are sending 100 iPhones as gifts
Lowest number of iPhones were sent this year
Do you know what replaced it?
Folding phones
Because the wow factor of folding phones was very low
And tomorrow Apple will get a fold
It will be worth 4 lakhs and people will buy it again
What happened now 2023 there was a shift to the wow factor of folding phones
Alright one question now we are talking about iPhones sales
In India how many people buy iPhones for the software hardware optimizations the
you know really good looks and good camera?
And how many of them buy just because it has that brand value?
It is because there is an iPhone thats why
So what will be Should I answer?
There are a lot of people who change their new iPhone on day one
There are a lot of such people
There are a lot of people who will change their iPhone after 34 years
But there are a lot of people who dont care
What is the percentage?
Listen listen
There are a lot of people who dont care if the iPhone is worth 2 lakhs 3 lakhs or 5
They dont care
They are using the iPhone and they will buy it
Maybe they are on the ecosystem
They dont care about the ecosystem
They may not even use 5 of the iPhone on their phone
All they are doing is just phone calls and WhatsApp
But just because they have the money
They just have to have it
They have the money
They have to have it
They buy it
They will buy 10 pieces of iPhone on day one and gift it to their family
Those who have to have it still continue
This is number one
Number two
Those people who are coming in the creator space
Because iPhone is such a robust device
Those young guys
They will buy a phone and they know that this is the phone which will be able to do multiple
things in once
I can also edit on it
I can also shoot on it
The camera is also good
Everything is good
Instagram works well for example
They will get that
In todays date
The people who are buying only because of the Apple logo
That number is less
Earlier also when there was a number where only the Apple logo was flexing
Till the point he actually bought that phone
That thought will be there
But once they start using it
Then its no more
Their next phone will be iPhone only
I will add one more thing
I think the person who drives the purchase
I will break down a secret of the iPhone ad
That if you ever give an ad of iPhone
In that a normal person will not use it
They will show that a person is going
Climbing a mountain
Coming down 50 meters in the sea
So I think he drives the sale of a product
That is when professionals start using something
Now you will see
In India or in the whole world
All the cinematographers are using the iPhone
All the gamers
No matter where they get sponsors
But they are actually streaming on the iPhone
So all the professionals
It is visible that they are using the iPhone
All the DJs have MacBooks
They dont need a screen
And the normal consumer
Follows this audience
Follows the professional
Have you worn a watch ultra?
Are you really the target customer for watch ultra?
You are not the
Where are you going to climb the mountain?
I dont know about you
I said it
But okay
The watch is targeted for extreme sports
Normally like that
Since the launch of watch ultra
All the people I have met
Who used to use Apple watch
Till yesterday
Series 6 7 8
Whether they are the target customers or not
They are all on ultra now
Majority of them
And the simple reason is
Because this is
Battery is also broken
Battery is one of the biggest reason
Battery is the biggest reason
To whom ever I have spoken
But 3 raise 1 is nothing
Apart from battery
The reason is
Because this is the most expensive Apple watch
This is the latest one
They need to have it
And thats the reason they have it
I have seen people
Which one are you wearing?
I have seen
I am wearing a Rolex
And I am not wearing a smart watch right now
This is a very strange situation
Forget that
My point is
I will ask you an example
I will ask you a simple question
And I will tell you my reaction to it
When Samsung launched Fold in India
Or when it was launched in the world
The idea was targeting towards professionals
Who will work on the go
Okay I agree
To a certain extent
Some people who actually do business
And they need a fold phone
And they used the phone
Their life is changed now
And I will tell you
If we get the data of Samsung
If we can tell something from Samsung
In Delhi NCR
All the people who have money
They have kept 2 folds
And they have no business
They dont do anything in the phone
I have seen this
In Pune too
And in Pune too
And Samsung
The sales that Samsung got in India
Of the folds
They have got it from them
Very few people from business
But the one who had money
The one who was able to buy
He bought it
Leave it in Delhi
Same thing is there in iPhone
It is there in folds
They show you how to climb a mountain
How to swim in the sea
I am saying
They have kept their watch
And they are tracking their steps
The professionals and top tier people
Those who are using
Noravrandha follows them
So it is the same thing
After listening to all your talks
After summing up
What I felt
Because you really got to learn
One thing is understood
Apple is one of the super lucky companies
If the aspiration ends
Lets take an example
The aspiration is over
Everyone has an iPhone
Their foundation is so strong
That the ecosystem has come
Maybe you will buy airports
Their sale is increasing
Subscriptions and multiple things
Subscription has come
As you named it
It became popular among the creators
We have seen
The product becomes popular
In the middle of the community
If it is in the middle of the creators
Then he will buy a MacBook
And Atom is also good
Final Cut Pro will buy
Lucky word
I used it wrong
The foundation they have built
Their branches
That is very solid
It will be strong
I will give you an example
Poco community
Xiaomi community
Any brand
Realme community
iQoo community
All the Android communities
If Xiaomis product
Becomes popular
If Xiaomis phone
Is coming in the bracket of 10000 or 15000
Redmi Note
Which used to come at one time
All those community members
They are joining in
They are using the Redmi phone
They are a part of the community
You tell them tomorrow
Take this
Your iPhone
They will leave the community immediately
They dont have that brand attachment
Just because
Given his scenario
His situation is
His affordability is till there
He is doing that
The day
He is able to afford an iPhone
He will buy a second iPhone
He doesnt have any attachment to Redmi
I would disagree
Brand loyalty
You get this
I would just say
Like premium customers
Redmi is not premium
I am talking about Redmi
I am talking about less than 15000
In a less priced point
But like some Vivo customers
And I have seen many Samsung customers
Samsung and Apple
Are on a level
Oppo as well
Oppo and Vivo
Very strong this time
This budget range
One question
If we shift from the iPhone
Which brand according to you
Which brand
Is the most popular
I mean
Which is most popular
And according to you guys and it might be controversial which brand first?
And we are going to talk to Bebop and Tamil
Which brand in 2023 do you think did the best brand of smartphone?
In Android no?
In Android
To make it interesting it has to be one
If we say that then you wont know
OK so for me it may be iQOO for two reasons
One when you see at the budget segment iQOO predominantly in the market only to sell the
But this time what they did is with iQOO Z7 Pro it might
be a rebranded smartphone whatever it is
But in a particular price segment they launched the smartphone with a good processor and also
with good cameras
So in my video most of the people who are asking about the budget segment smartphone
I recommend that one
And to a far extent the software is not refined before
But iQOO 12 they changed it maybe not 100 but at least by 40 or 30
They improved a bit
So thats what I personally feel
What about?
We have to name one huh?
Yeah thats when the fun starts
You can also say none so thats fine
If you dont know
Its not like theres no one
But one thing like Hes making fun of us
Now the thing Im notifying I read a lot of stats and I come to realize
that like inflation like we were talking about in
smartphones so usually the inflation number that the government shares with us which
is 67 but in smartphones in India it was 12
So Im not expecting the smartphone prices to go down in the coming year
Im only expecting them to go high
But at the same time Im also feeling that the smartphones that will come they will
be a little lean
They will not be launching every other month
Their product
They will reduce the portfolio
I feel that way
The question was different by the way
You made me go crazy
Say yes man
I am calculating the percentage right now
I was about to ask him what was the answer
So I am coming to that
One word answer
It should be a one word answer
Explanation later
So for me I think OnePlus Open is a standout device for me
And with that regard its OnePlus for me
Same here
Because one thing is that they have this green line issue
The software issue which has been rapidly happening with a lot of customers
They rectified it and they gave a proper explanation on why
And again with their product range OnePlus 11 and the Open looks very nice
Even the pad is also good
So the one brand that stood out for you is OnePlus?
I cannot stop using the OnePlus Open
Its that good
Also I mean a lot of the
Sometimes a single product can define a whole year
Define a whole year
Because we were all waiting for it as well right?
For OnePlus first foldable
Did it sell?
Im not sure about that
Im not sure about the numbers
From a techies perspective
So Im not sure about the numbers but okay
So two things I liked about the OnePlus Open
The approach of OnePlus towards the Open
One they didnt make it like they launched a foldable for Rs 80000
Its premium
They launched it at a premium price in India
We know that Samsung will launch it for Rs
15 Lakhs
So they also have one for Rs 40000 number one
They didnt play on the price bit
They know that they need to establish that as a premium product
Second thing they went all out with marketing
Go to airports go to premium places youll see Open all around
So okay you cant expect results straight from the first year
But it clearly shows the trajectory ahead
That in the coming years they will be there
And I think it looks good from this point that they will have a certain solid lineup
in the foldables
I mean I wasnt finishing my answer
Its that OnePlus also not just the Open across
Like they refined their lineup or they you know made it better this year with the
Nord CE 3 and the Nord 3
11R I think
11R was a fantastic device
So you know that at every segment theres a OnePlus phone to cater to every audience
So even if you dont like the phone or not as a reviewer people are buying it
I saw so many OnePlus Nord CE 3s its not even funny
Even at airports and the Nord Buds 2R
So popular
So OnePlus is actually getting the audience to acknowledge their devices and buy it
So theyve done a good job
And I think they will continue to do a good job if they continue to keep it this way
And if they could just kind of do a segregation between Open
Just answer my question
Who has improved the most?
Which smartphone brand impressed you in 2023?
OnePlus for sure
For me too I found one thing very interesting in OnePlus this year
Like I tried OnePlus 12
It is all an experiment
I mean all the things like the alert slider they removed it first
Then they put it back on the right side
Now they put it on the left side
And in its software they sometimes put the aperture slider up
So every phone is like full of experiments
And there were a lot of issues with it like the green line issue
But some experiments have been done
Like OnePlus Open was in my opinion a very risky product
Because it would cost Rs 1 lakh
And to launch it at that price
So in my opinion OnePlus showed the guts to experiment and
I would give it to them
Because OnePlus Open is genuinely a good smartphone but it is not there yet
There is no actual proof of concept yet
Which brand is it?
Its the same
Its not there yet
I had two but I have to pick only one
But I would say OnePlus and Motorola
These were the two brands that in my opinion they did very very well
But OnePlus is the winner because of that OnePlus Open
When OnePlus 11 11R all these came and if you see the 10 I mean the ones before
2022 those two years OnePlus launched shit phones
But this year 2023 whether all the series you look at
it whether it is Nord or Nord C or their 11 11R
excellent phones but best thing OnePlus Open
And thats why OnePlus is my brand
I can copy the video of Babar Azam from Pakistan
Theres a video that has gone viral where Rohit Sharma says a long answer in English
And Babar says yes my answer is also same
Yes same same
So OnePlus the reason for that is again was OnePlus 7
Pro or 7T Pro?
It had a popup camera and a curved screen
Both 7 and 7 Pro
That was the last amazing OnePlus
We saw the deviation in 8 9 10
But this year and it clearly showed that was the
beginning 11 11R everything is going well
Nord C Ill give you an example
I was in BITS Pilani Hyderabad campus
I must have taken at least 500700 selfies there
And 80 was using that lime color what color is it?
Lime color
Lime color CE3 light
I mean Im seeing that every other student has CE3 light
CE2 light was the highest setting
I said CE3 light is also going to be the highest
For that matter even Nord 3T light
3T amazing performance good package
Open they have nailed it
So I think acknowledging the faults what went wrong over the years and coming up with
a solid lineup I think OnePlus
And I remember speaking to OnePlus guys in 2022 and they had told me that you look
at 2023 the lineup we have you will change the thought process about OnePlus
So they have done it
Yes sir
So I think everybody has already said quite a few interesting things
You know OnePlus seems to be Wait a minute
Lets score them
IQ got one
OnePlus OnePlus OnePlus OnePlus OnePlus OnePlus OnePlus OnePlus
Why is OnePlus written on the bottle?
But my answer is not OnePlus
So edges are different then
The middle the middle
So acknowledged OnePlus
Motorola you said was fantastic
I think Vivo is another company that is doing some great work
Dont be diplomatic
You only said dont say two and now he said three
Youve already done all this
Its done
But Ill give a very very contradictory answer
Another company that has really impressed me this year is another company that is pushing
innovation at price points that are not possible
They are opening up markets
Its making people imagine and that is techno
I was about to say that
Its a very unusual thing for a company to have the guts to be able to take so many risks
Whether you look at folding phones or flip phones they want to be premium also
They want to bring in things in very different ways
I like the guts of that company and Id love to see what they do in 2024
Because the people who never thought of buying a folding phone at least they still may not
be buying it
I dont know what they are selling
The people who have never bought a folding phone I dont think theyll buy a techno
I bought that
You bought it?
Bro look at its hinge
But I had a poster
Its been a while the hinge is moving
I had a poster
Sales of the folding techno phone
With that techno folding
I saw your video and bought that techno folding
And he was very happy with it
So Im actually surprised
I work with a lot of analysts who only track this
And they track it through various sources including from mobile networks which phone
is latching on
So they have all these numbers instead of just fake numbers from brands
Theyve actually sold very well
And the fold has sold more than their flip
Yeah even I like the Camo series
Yeah that was nice
Okay I think
The last question and I want to close off with
Something very interesting
I mean we all review phones so we get phones to use
But Im pretty sure that were also buying gadgets of our own right?
Im not so sure
I just want to double check that now
Starting from Rajiv whats the best and the worst gadget purchase of 2023 for you?
Best and worst huh?
Best and worst oneone each
So Ill tell you Ill give you a guess
I think everybody has enough time to think about it
So I think I bought
One of my best purchases has been an LG OLED TV
Im very surprised at just how good they are getting this technology and at prices that
I could not even imagine right?
Absolutely fantastic
And because I was in a very big hurry and I was very excited by it because Ive been
using it for years my disappointment one was the new Sony XM5
Its still a great product
Its just that I still feel that the previous generation is better
The overhead ones?
You should have kept it to smartphone
Did you buy it and which one was the worst?
Both have been bought
I said I was in a big hurry so I actually bought it from abroad
My worst
To be honest I cant remember it and I cant highlight it
But the best I know is the DJI Osmo Pocket 3
Amazing cute little camera
Handheld inbuilt gimbal its a oneinch sensor
Comes with a mic thats automatically paired with the camera
Are you using it regularly for content creation?
No so I havent used it much till now
But I think if I have to carry just one camera sometimes you cant carry a big DSLR for vlogging
and stuff
And if you use an iPhone you have to use a rear camera use a wide angle low light
is not that good sometimes
You know it has its own complications
So this small gimbal which you can attach a small tripod it will stay in one place
you know selftracking and all those things
So I think its a good camera
And yeah the best has happened but the worst is not coming to my mind at this time
I have not bought too many things
Honestly only the one I remember and which I think was excellent was the MetaQuest 3
which I got from the UK
We forced you to get it
Perfect correct
Yeah so thats all
I dont have
I havent even purchased the rest yet
I have bought a bedsheet for around 225 lakhs
And what happens in that it is 8sleeve
And the worlds top
Nowadays he has gone into biohacking
Health fitness
We havent talked about that yet
Health fitness of creators
It is a bedsheet that changes the temperature of your body so that your sleep improves
Elon Musk
Top athletes
A lot of billionaires
They all use it
And when you hear it youll think what is he sleeping on?
But that has improved my sleep a lot
And I think sleep is something that has a huge impact on life
So my best purchase so far is the same as of this year
Send me the link
I have a question
Its not sponsored
Does he have an app or not?
I havent used his app much
He has an app
So do you do any preset?
Or you dont have to do anything?
I just set it like that
Im asking the question because I have a lot of trouble getting up
I cant get up
I mean I enjoy sleeping
And my deep sleep becomes very deep
So I thought if he has an app where you can set an alarm kind of thing that at 8 in the
morning you can make it completely cold
Then the eyes will open or something
What does it actually do?
So you can actually its called a silent alarm on this
It vibrates
Vibration is a new term
It does it with temperature
It increases the temperature
Its very slowly
Changes the temperature enough
Its a good thing if there is something like that
If I have 150 alarms on my phone I cant open my eyes
I dont purchase worst things
Say worst ever
If you want to say even if you buy it in 2022
It was worst for us that I bought a RED camera
And I think the whole setup cost me 1015 lakhs
But its so tough to use that we used it in 56 videos
So its worst for us but it can be good for someone
Not fitting in your routine
The workflow
Got it got it
Okay okay
Next Ill tell you
Best I felt I enjoy audio products a lot
I spend the most money on audio products
Like what?
So there is a Sony soundbar
Sony HTA7000 I think
And the surround sound experience that I get from that soundbar
I went crazy
I have it at home
I do it a lot
I enjoy it a lot
With the rear speakers and
Its wireless
The one you picked up for the
The same one you picked up
Same one
So I also have the same one
Same one same one
How much is it for?
I think 12 lakhs
25 lakhs for the whole setup
Rear speakers and the woofer
Okay it has rear speakers too
I can add everything
I can add as many speakers as I want
Crazy experience
White white
I mean Im satisfied
But hes talking about soundbar
If I dont buy the soundbar
No no you can get a soundbar plus those
I thought it only comes as a package with the two speakers
No four speakers and soundbar
You can fit it anywhere
You just have to give power
Sonys naming convention
Coming back to this thing
I think the A9s were the ones with the four speakers setup
And there was the A7000 with the soundbar
Soundbar and
Subwoofer comes with it right?
Subwoofer comes with it
When they said XM5 headphones or earphones
Subwoofer package
But if youre asking about a particular product then
It comes in a bundle
You have to say something
I mean it comes in a bundle
I bought the whole bundle
And Im very happy
Should I talk about the worst?
Its the exact same setup and
How much did it cost?
25 Lakh
The second worst I can recall because as such Im telling you all the time
I just bought it
Recently to make a video I bought a Blackberry passport
Oh God!
Why did you make it?
Dont say that
I used to use it
And it was a very strong phone
Today its experience is bad
Because today
It was from the time of iPhone 6
And I was comparing it side by side
There was so much wrong in it
I was using it at that time
See I used to text
And in that the keypad is all touch sensitive
Youre typing
It used to give you three options in predictive text
One here one here one here
The area where you swipe on the keypad that word will come
And I used it like crazy
Its screen
Its I think
1440 by 1440
Like a square
So today
Its my phone
Thats what I said
Of all time which I bought in 2023 what problem did I face in the keyboard?
That literally they removed the letters and put a space bar in between
That means I have to bring a learning curve
If I have to start using the keyboard then I have to get used to that my space bar will
be in between the letters
Where there should be a B there is a space bar
No problem
And when I saw other things that phone only asks for learning curves
It says first learn how to use it
In that BBOS which has a passport in that if you
swipe to the side at the same place there are WhatsApp threads chatting threads
Facebook threads and email and text
Everything is on one side
But I heard that
It was such an amazing thing
But I heard that APK didnt work
It used to work at that time
It used to work in the beginning
When the transition happened there was a solution by
adding Amazons app store
But only to a certain time
You know what happened to my passport?
Ill tell you my incident story
My passport was
Its a square device
From the bottom it has a sharp edge device
I kept it on the table like this
And it fell like this
This was the distance that it fell
And the screen was
It was worst product
Otherwise it was good
So obviously I also dont buy a lot of tech
I dont have lakhs
But what I picked up recently was a backbone one
Its a controller that you attach to your phone
Im very interested in gaming
So I dont get time to play the PS5
So even in iPhone 15 you can play all the games
I mean Resident Evil is already out there
So I wanted to play that
And a lot of Indies that I wanted to play
So best purchase ever
Because I got a good 50 off
I got it for 5000
I was damn happy
Worst purchase was an audio product
Im an audiophile
So I spend money on audio products
So there was a Fiio FH5
So it was such an impulsive purchase
It was so bass heavy
I didnt like it at all
I dont know what to do
Which one?
Fiio FH5
Its an audiophile
How much is it?
I got it for about 1920 thousand
And this backbone controller?
Is it Bluetooth or you have to connect it?
No its a its like a type C one
So it gets it attaches to your thing
Your phone
Any phone
But he keeps playing that
So yeah
I love it
I have two best
One is just like he said the pocket the pocket 3 DJI
And another one is
TWS which is called Moondrop Space Travel
It costs around like 25 dollars
I think you can import here also 3000 rupees or something
Very good stuff for that price
Worst will be Sony Xperia 1 Mark 5
That phone
The problem He buys a lot of it
The problem with Sony in my experience the last Xperia 1 Mark 1 2 3 4 5 is that they
are having good hardware
But Sony didnt learn computational photography
So camera sensor is good
But when you click photos there was no night mode
Now there is night mode
So what Google Samsung Apple have been doing over the years
Sony didnt latch on to the computational photography
And thats why the photos and videos are very bad
The best purchase is actually we bought a speaker for one of our videos
It was lyric speaker
Whatever you play Hindi English Punjabi anything
It will start the lyrics and lyrics will come in the style
of the mood of the song
And its a really nice thing
And I kept it in my home and I enjoy it
Its a nice motivational starter
Worst actually there will be a lot of worst
Team actually purchases a lot of stuff
They dont tell me the worst
That is for sure
So I am not sure about the worst but that was the best
The storeroom is full of worst products
Yes it is
Alright Tavel
So my best tip would be two things
One is hardware side
I bought a new Insta360 for 360
Just take it in your hand and you can cover everything
You dont have to like for vlogging every time take out the phone or the camera and
You can give the voice over suggestions
Enjoy the moment
That one
And the second thing is software
After paying a lot of amount for Sony Resolve for one time that was the best
decision and
the best software for editing
Worst is a smart ring
I bought it for 10k and it is not worth it
I thought something from abroad
Sleep tracking was not on to the point
Because we used to wear it
The least thing No this was my engagement ring
The least thing That was the best one
Sorry guys I am going to interrupt
Should we do a do a thumbnail I will have to leave
Thank you so much Thank you for coming
This was fantastic
Thank you
Great great
Great initiative
See you
Bye Shlok
Bye bye

Good to see you
We will sit and chat for sure
Lots of hard work
Good to meet you
Nice to meet you
Well catch up again
Nice to see you
Well also sit and chat at some point

Good meeting up
Best of luck
I wanted to ask this question
How do you guys take care of your health?
So I really want to know
Because 2023 for me I have focused on health like crazy
Because till last year I was just going mad literally working working
But since I started focusing on health it helped me in my work as well
I find myself getting even more free time now
I dont know how
My productivity has increased
What has happened?
My mind is in a better space
But what about your health?
What is your
In my opinion because I have been part of this biohacking community and all
Till now we used to think that we have to live for 6070 years
Its like okay lets live
Well grow old
All the people I have met who are part of this community who are working on top tier
technologies age reversal
A few years from now or the technologies that are still there you can live for 100150
I mean you can live through them
And its not just that youll be able to live
You can live like a 30yearold healthy person
8090 years
And I think
You can have an active lifestyle
And So what youre doing?
Youre doing something like that?
There are a lot of machines
Like it is diet
There are machines
There are technologies
Like for example right now it happens that most people are deficient in something
And as Im doing scientist research Im finding out that everything is because
of a deficiency
If youre not eating properly your pancreas doesnt function properly and you develop
If youre not eating properly eventually you develop cancer
And research has been done clinically proven that if you keep eating certain things throughout
your life you wont develop diabetes you wont develop cancer and you wont get sick
And there are supplements
There are supplements for everything
There are supplements for treatment
I was just looking at it
You were eating so many
How many tablets do you eat?
Tablets are like
It might sound a little weird that I eat 2022 tablets a
But those tablets are like turmeric powder neem powder Okay
Theres some fish oil
So its a very basic supplement type
Theyre not medicines
But they are
Theyre supplements
And theyve developed a lot now
Theyve refined a lot
And the second thing is that there are such technologies that you can use in your body
while exercising naturally
For example theres a body suit
If you wear that and work out for half an hour it is like working out for 4 hours
So if you wear that and do normal work youll basically have a workout session
And theres a machine its called a sculptor
In that there are electrical simulations in the body
So if you put it on your stomach within half an hour you can do around 20000 pushups
And the body basically does this
The body has electrical signals
So the muscles contract and contract and contract
It happens very quickly
And it hurts
But all these things work
Because I did 7 sessions of the sculptor
And my abs got a little better
And Only in 7 sessions?
Yes 7 sessions
But it is painful
We all want to see your abs
But as soon as it comes As soon as it comes first of all for you
But Im getting that moment from the Nayak movie
Im like hes trapped
But it is like an experiment
It might work it might not
So youre doing a lot of biohacking
And health
So youre focusing on that
Yes there are some other people with whom Im connected
And theyre on the same path
Now I think as far as Im concerned I have a lot of faith in science and this
And the output Ive seen for my body its very positive
So Ill do it and see
And well know
Well know
And videos are coming
Yes videos are coming
I did something in between
I saw the thumbnail I didnt see the video
Thats testing
Basically I think its a very simple philosophy
To improve health even in an uneven business the thing you can measure you can improve
So if you take a blood test you can measure vitamin D A B C whatever comes you can
measure everything
Similarly if you measure your lungs your stomach your pancreas you can measure everything
and youll know that these things in your body are bad
And if you track that and keep improving it so
basically your body will also improve
And as it improves you have a biological age which is called the rate of aging
If you live for a year then most people if theyre eating
bad food if theyre not exercising they reduce their age
So after living for a year theyre dragging their lives
for two years
So if you reduce that 05 03 so basically your rate
of aging if you live for a year so basically in that year you only spent three months
So if you live for a year then your one year will end
So you can live for 150 years
A lot of biohacking going on here
And Ill add one more thing to this that sitting in
India we think that all these things are not common
That in 70 years who is tracking and whose abs are there?
But there is a country like this in the world there is a country in Okinawa Japan
There it is common that 8090 years old people have blue zones
Blue zones
And tracking and living a very healthy lifestyle
So this is possible from the beginning
But by breaking it down scientifically yes
scientifically it is being given
And I think this is the future
And people will live for 150 years
But it takes a lot of money now
Okay I have a question for this
So you told me your diet is the main thing right?
So do you prefer foods that are only like raw fruits and veggies that thing?
Or what are the impurities that we usually have in our daily daytoday foods?
Like in flour even in that what do you do with that?
So I have a lot I mean we cant do anything about it
We do what we can
Thats why I am asking
Because you went to Chennai and did all the testings and everything
They can tell you that you eat half a kg of this of
fruits or 100 grams of this
Those things you can
But the impurities in your food which we cant see directly
But it is like do you have any solutions?
Of course in living in this society sitting here we
might have smoked 5 cigarettes
Because this is Delhi
So we cant do anything about that
For that you can shift
Maybe you can shift to Kerala
There the impurities will be less
So that is what I will also do
You are planning to do
He is planning to shift to your city
I am planning
I think to what extent you can go to that depends
For example there is a guy named Brian Johnson
He doesnt leave his house
He cooks his own food
He does everything himself
So what is the use of cooking at home?
But he experiments on himself and does it for us
No I just wanted to know
Because he is the king of biohacking
He understood the whole technology
You come up in farms
You stay where there are a lot of farms
So you must be getting pure
Impurities is all the way
Because even while seeding itself they use the pesticides and everything
They grow the fruits
Do you do any exercises?
And you stay fit like this
No I was not fit
Like when we met 4 or 5 months ago you told me about it
Before when we met in China
After that when I came to Pune
Because thats what I was about to speak actually
Physical health and mental health
Both are big things for creators
So I keep on running in the morning and day
In and out
Because I have to oversee everything
Until you have a good team you have to do everything
Which we usually do for the past 8 years
Then mental health with all the negativities happening around you and a lot of things that
is going around you personally and professionally
So managing these things was my priority this particular year
Going forward it will change
Because after having a lot of discussion and a lot of
I got to take a lot of things in my mind
Kanchit bhai
So I have a lot of perspective about health
Especially creators
What are you doing?
I will tell you what I am doing
I will give context behind it
Shlok told the tech side
I will tell the emotional side
I have this problem that I have to take a lot of stress in the initial days
So stress level increases and stress is also mental obviously
We seriously dont know what stress is what anxiety is
what depression is
All three things are different
But we think these are words
But it is not exactly like that
There is a different story behind everything
So I was in stress and I was taking a lot of milk
Obviously it is expensive
After that suddenly I was not able to digest protein
Then there were a lot of proteins like lentils chicken
So I was taking a lot of protein
Then I was taking a lot of milk
Then I was taking a lot of protein
Whatever it is Im not able to do it
All this has happened to me within 3 years
But what was my focus?
YouTube YouTube YouTube
Im busy with YouTube all the time
So that was it
I didnt understand what was happening
to me
I thought a bad phase of life is going on
It will be fine
But then there was a talk going on on the podcast
of BRBicep
I keep listening to the podcast
Manish Pandey probably a lot of people know him
He does a lot for creators
Hes your friend right?
So he once said in a conversation to someone I think Ranveer Alabadia must have said it
that creators dont know what the side effect of YouTube
We have no idea because everything is so new
Some people get hit some dont
I was unlucky that I got hit
So recently I was watching a podcast of Ranveer
Ranveer himself said that he suddenly stopped digesting cheese
I have become lactose intolerant
Maybe Shlok had also said that he stopped digesting milk
I think stress is hitting creators
But we dont realize it
Its hitting in different ways
I think so
But I realized that I have a problem with stress
By the way everything is fine after marriage
So I mean Shlok is happy
Im kidding
Anyway stress management is something
I just found out
Maybe it will work in someones life
The thing I told you
But yes stress management is a process that should be taken in life if you have stress
I learned this
Im doing it
Tell me Gaurav
Your muscles are very real in the middle
I can still see it
I have taken a little break now
But I think if we just follow the basics
Basics means
Do workout
Half an hour one hour
You just walk or go for a jog
Or lift weights or whatever
Basically there has to be a balance
Between your diet
Between your sleep
And your workouts
As long as you have those basics set right
You are going to the gym
You are sweating
You are jogging
And you are sweating
I think it drains all the negative energy
It freshens you up
If you wake up in the morning and do workout
For the rest of the day you are completely charged
You will be charged
Good thoughts will come
You will do the work well
Its a loop
Its a positive loop that you go into
As long as you are maintaining a balance
You are partying for a day in a week
But do you know that the next day
I will have to balance what I ate last night
I am taking out the waste here for two hours
So as long as you have a balance
It should be fine
I am not the person who will be like that in any case
I will lock myself in the house like a normal person
I am not like that
Or for example Shlok did his research
I wont go that extreme
I think as long as I am able to do the basics
Its a good enough thing
And at least to start with
You have to do that
The rest is on top of it
By the way I will share a few things
Because we were talking about this
So I had the same problem
With a lack of some vitamins
You get depressed
I mean if you are deficient in some vitamins
I think there are some vitamins of B For a period of two to three years
You will get depressed
You will get anxiety attacks
And with vitamin D you lose sleep
For example I didnt have any protein left
With the supplementation of B1 and B12
I am able to digest protein well now
So I think
I mean if we look at food a little consciously
I mean its not necessary
You have to take a tablet
Its in nutritional yeast
Its in egg or something
By supplementing all that
If you are eating properly
You can stop depression
Its possible that anxiety attacks
If you can stop all these things
I am saying what happens is
Basically in this creator space
Because of the priorities set towards that
Everything else takes a toll
You wont be able to sleep on time
Eating and drinking will be random
You travel a lot
Because of that the routine is not set
So it gets affected
Whether you see it in a year
Or in two years
Or in five years
Depending on how long your body can tolerate that thing
Sometimes you will get the result
So I think because of the kind of burnouts
You are facing
Or you are too much engrossed into just your
Like creating thing
So I think a balance is necessary for that thing
As long as its balanced
To start with
That should happen
If that doesnt happen
Then its negative will definitely happen
I am seeing the journey
Right in front of you
He has lost something like 15 kgs
Now he is on his way
Yeah so bad eating habits
I mean because
Eating happens due to stress
Eat anything
And never cared about health
I obviously play a lot of cricket
And like you know
We started playing cricket in office
Yeah so I have also ensured
That the whole team on Saturday
Every Saturday we play cricket
Very proper
I couldnt run
And I am like
Like this is not me
Like you know earlier
So I had to like
Take some changes
Make some changes
I didnt start with exercise
I used to only play cricket
But I started intermittent fasting properly
And then I cut sugar from my life
I dont
I dont generally prefer sugar either
But sugar is not required for your body
Very good advice
So its not
Thats the best
Both of us dont eat sugar
I mean additional sugars
But total I mean
And then also like
Protein intake and everything
Thats not been a problem
But cutting carbs
All those basic things
Doing those basic things
Its making a difference
And now I have started
Proper exercising as well
Which is basically walking and running
So its helping
So I was 110
Now I am like
Now I am like 98
I was 110 at one point of time
I was like literally
Into YouTube space
I was like
I was in a very bad mental state
This is common
Bad mental space
Every YouTuber
It reflects into your routine
Thats the problem
You are not in your right mind
You wont be able to sleep
You wont be able to wake up the next day
On time
Your day
So its a loop
Sir this YT creator studio app
Which is showing you in real time
Now 10 views have increased
Now 20 have increased
Depends on how much you are using
Then it is showing comments
Then you know
You are getting feedback in real time
The audience is feeling bad
Feeling good
This is a very stressful thing
Which can happen to anyone
So I did
Went for like a therapy session
With a proper psychologist
That kind of
That was the initial thing
Then after that I Does it help?
Yeah it does
It does help
How many sessions you had?
I had like a proper
Help for you?
But I didnt
I dont believe
For me it works
So its fine
No its about how we perceive it
They will give their input
Based on our
Whatever saying we have
But we need to act accordingly
So it might differ person to person
Yeah that is there
So for me it worked
And after that I decided
I have to reduce my weight
No I heard a dietician
I have a back issue
I have a spine issue
I have a slipped disc
So I cant work out
Or lift heavy stuff
Or run for a very long time
So I have a dietician
Im still following a proper diet
So thats how I reduced it to 98
You are you are slim and trim
So you do something for it
Or it is all natural
Im going to tell you that only
YouTube studio
Or YouTube
The more stats we see on the phone
The more anxiety there is
And sometimes
The game of views is going up and down
So you dont like it
So just before the shoot
You were showing me a video
And I told him
I dont have YouTube
Im watching it on Safari
Because Im detoxing
So the idea is simple
I dont keep all these apps on my phone
Because Im so engrossed in the office
None of the apps are on my phone
So that is one thing that I dont do
Like dont keep it in my phone
I install it
For fitness
So there are various basic things
On which we collectively work throughout the office
From this data Ive got from internet only
That if you walk 10000 steps in a day
So you can stay away from a lot of diseases
So we have
We are doing a step up challenge in our office
So we are 35 people
So 35 people are challenging each other
And everyone has to complete 10000 steps
Every single day
Its tracked on an app
I mean a step up app
It will be tracked on that
And the winners will get exciting prizes
So this is how we are promoting fitness
In our office
We should implement something like this at our office
This app
Because I want
It tracks through just the smartphone
Or it can pair with an Apple watch
Or a fitness band
Or whatever
It can be paired with a fitness band also
Or it can be paired with your phone as well
Because the steps on the phone will be a little inaccurate
Because you either have to keep the phone in the gym
Now theres a catch in that as well
If you do it like this
Then also the step count will be there
But we will give that benefit of doubt
Its up to you
At least if someone is doing it like this with dedication
Then it will be a little more impressive
But yeah
And people
I mean all the team members
They are taking it very positively
And this is one thing we are doing
But slowly and gradually
We will amplify it more
We have just started with walking
Walking is the best exercise
By the way
You had also told in a podcast
I used to walk 30000 steps
4 months straight I did that
And I lost 30 kilos in 4 months
From 105 to 75
You told me this in your podcast
If I open my health app and go to the gym for that duration the rings go around 10 times
2000 calories burn
2500 calories burn just from walking
3 hours 35 hours 4 hours walk
You are always extreme
This is in nature
For me its either best or nothing
As long as I am not doing it or if nothing is involved then its fine
But the day I come in I want to make sure that I take the lead
What a word of thanks
I hope everyone enjoyed the conversation
I am presuming
will be takeaways for everyone
And hopefully we can  do
this next year as well
Thats the idea
This is just the beginning
How much duration did you do?
35 hours
35 to 4 hours
I am getting a lot of blessings from my heart for some editor
2000 to 4000 GB data
The editor is watching the video
Minimum 3000 to 4000 GB data
If there
are 8 cameras and 3 roles
And RAW 3 to 4 TB data
what I am saying
All done
so much
It was fantastic
Thank you crew
we have finally come
with Overlays Clothing haul
The first package has come to us
There is lot of improvement in the brand
and these improvements
will blow your mind
the stiff package
has become shiny and polished
Also if we talk about the sweatshirt inside it
this time
they have done amazing work on the material
You get the tag of Overlays
The pricing is written here as
Rs 1599
You dont have to pay this
You can see what you have to pay on its website
The sweatshirt is in black colour
Hem at the bottom
cuffing in the hand
round neck
all these things are common
You get fur on the inside
Overall if we talk about its fabric
the fabric is like Lalu Yadav
I mean the fabric is very soft
Mulayam Singh Ji
dont get angry
If you see at its left chest
Overlays branding has been done in white colour
But the special thing about this sweatshirt
is its back print
A very beautiful bird
has been designed in multiple colours
whose feathers are very big
And the quality of the print
is also looking very good
It is a bit embossed this time
At the bottom
Rise Overlays is written here
Simple in the front
Twinkle at the back
And it looks amazing
The quality is good
Lets quickly go towards the next
You can see me wearing it at the back
Alright the next product has come to us
It is another very beautiful black colour hoodie
The designing is same
You get hem at the bottom
and cuffing in the hands
You get a large hood
and kangaroo pockets in the front
Truly this time
the material is of very good quality
If we talk about the sizing of the hood
the hood is quite large
You get lining on the inside
Well its drawstring
seems very weak
It seems that
by taking out the lays from Overlays
this lace has been made
which you can eat too
In the front
you get same white colour Overlays branding
or logo
This is the only simple designing in it
it is a black coloured solid hoodie
The quality is very good
How am I looking on wearing it
you have seen this
Lets quickly go to the next product
And its a very beautiful sweatshirt
Shlok has used many beautiful colours this time
I had planned for all these sweatshirts
or this haul a month and a half ago
And a month and a half ago
we ordered all these products
So much delay
Even if I order clothes from America
then also it will not be delayed so much
Now either Shloks clock is slow
or Overlays has become Overdelays
I dont know this
And this did not happen only with me
Basically many of you faced this problem
Well if we talk about this particular sweatshirt
the material is very good
cuffing in the hand round neck
The quality of the fur on the inside
is very good
On the left chest
you will get the branding of Overlays here
but this time in black colour
It also has amazing back print
All the beauty lies at the back
Here you can see
Overlays is written like this
and there is a purple colour snake
which has flowers on it
Maybe this snake eats manure
that is why
flowers are coming out of its body parts
the quality of the print is very good
they have not compromised in terms of quality
you can see this at the back
You can see the fitting
I have taken L size
and my height is around 511
Alright next product has come to us
in a beautiful and shiny
packet of sweets
When they launched these winterwears
then Shlok actually said that
they will make such products
that will give competition to international brands
in terms of quality
and are also at very cheap prices
This has truly happened to some extent
but the problems that the customer had to face
are of next to next level
There is one more problem
I will tell you that later
Well if we talk about this hoodie
this whole hoodie is made of fur
You will get to see some offwhite in it
and you get black beneath it
You get kangaroo pockets in the front
and hem at the bottom
Everything is similar to a normal hoodie
If you see on its left chest
you will get to see a metal plate
in which the branding of Overlays
has been done
But if we talk about its upper fabric
or if we talk about its fur basically
Oh my God
it is very soft
and makes you feel very cosy
when you hold it
It is another very beautiful sweatshirt
which comes in an amazing colour
ie in lavender colour
If we talk about this sweatshirt
the fabric and quality are same
everything is same
you get the same branding of Overlays
which has been done through rubber coating
On the inside
the fur quality and everything else
and you dont get anything at the back
It is a solid lavender colour sweatshirt
If I say straight
if this Overdelays brand
is covering Pan India
they should be ready for these problems
they should not launch the products
so late in winter
because they will surely earn
because all the orders
have already been placed
Those who prepaid for their orders
I had also prepaid for my orders
I unknowingly wrote in the community post
that I had not prepaid
but actually
I came to know afterwards
that I had also prepaid
So all that money
was stuck for one and a half months
and we did not receive any product
And now what has happened
Well you have seen me wearing this sweatshirt
We will talk about this further
Alright next we had ordered a track pant
When we started this haul
we ordered total 8 products
Till the end
even after one and a half months
the result was
that only 7 products were delivered
they gave refund for one of the product
its fabric is same
as the fabric of a hoodie
It is as soft as Mulayam Singh Yadav
from the inside as well as outside
On the left side
you get the branding of Overlays
which is in white colour
The depth of the pocket is good
It is good
It is not very deep
nor it is very small
It has the same poor drawstrings
which could have been better
The quality of the waist is very good
The fur on the inside are same
as hoodies
And definitely
it is a good pant
Even if you want
you cannot go for it
You cannot go for it because
it is out of stock
When I thought of making this video
if it would have been available at that time
then you could have bought it
but you cannot buy it now
Now winter is almost over in our city
and it has started to get warm here
We are wearing sweater in the videos because
winter is still there in some parts of the country
Lets take it out quickly
And it is a very beautiful sweatshirt
It feels like
salary has came when the event is already over
So what is the use now?
This sweatshirt is in sky blue colour
and cuffing in the hand
You get a round neck
The pricing is written here as 1599
If you see at its back
a very good print has been done
What is written?
Overlays Clothing
Dare Dare Dare Dare
To Dream
And a large tiger has been made
It doesnt look like a tiger
but a Mongoose
it has been created with combination of
tiger snake and mongoose
You will get some flowers on the side
This print is also lightly embossed
And the quality is good
All these things that I say
is difficult for my subtitle writer to translate
We use certain words in Hindi
that are difficult to translate
they face difficulty in translating them in English
How am I looking on wearing the sweatshirt
Lets quickly go to the next
and the last product
When we thought about doing this haul
basically we do a series
on our channel
where we review Youtubers merch
This was a part of it
I was so disappointed
Many people had similar complaints
that their orders are stuck too
some of them had paid
but had not received the product yet
or some of them received it after a month
If we talk about this particular hoodie
it comes with same amazing
lavender colour
kangaroo pockets
a large hood
poor drawstrings
and lining on the inside
The quality of the fabric is very good
The quality of fur on the inside
You get a very beautiful back print in it too
Overlays is written here
There is a hand
which is holding a flower
the Congresss hand
is holding the lotus of BJP
Mulayam Singh
Lalu Yadav
Congress and BJP
everything is there in it
You get a lot of textography print at the bottom
You also get a barcode at the bottom
Overlays Clothing is written below it

TOBIN IS NEXT WITH SPORTS
Welcome to Techno Ruhez this  is the first video of our in MWC
There is a lot of noise  I apologize for that
But here we have come to the Infinix booth and we have got to witness two big technologies
The first thing is that  I have this phone
This is Infinixs eColorShift  technology smartphone
It has Prism 3 technology
If you look at the back  it glows in different colors
And it reacts according  to the design you want
That is if you want to wave someone or want some other design you can do that here
You get 8 basic colors in this and you can  customize this color in 100 different ways
You get to see a lot of amazing  technologies in this
And in the future such phones  of Infinix will come to the market
in which we will get  ColorShift technology
Its back panel is quite  premium than normal phones
As I was telling you if  you look at this back panel
you will feel that this  is a front display
But this is not a front display  this is a back panel
And if you look here  it glows like this
It will look like there is a camera in the  display but it is not like that
This is a back design
So this kind of technology will  be in the future smartphones
where the whole back  panel will glow in different colors
which you can customize  according to your needs
Do tell us in the comments  how did you like this technology
And this is our  AirCharge technology
You will see that this phone  is getting charged here
And this is a device of Infinix
And in this device you just have  to take your phone close to it
You dont have to  connect it with a wire
You dont have to  touch it wirelessly
Its not like you put it  in a wireless charger
As soon as I take it here you will see  that the phone has started charging
You can see that the  phone is charging
I havent done anything and  the phone is charging here
This is AirCharge technology
Right now Max you can  see the charging speed of 75W
Its 20cm
It wont work from here
I will have to take it very close
And when I go you will see  that the charging has started
The distance you get  here is not much
Its very less
If you come up to 10cm then  it provides you with a charging speed of 15W
So this is their  AirCharge technology
Infinix has done it here
Which other brand  I think Oppo has done it before
Now Infinix has done it here
I would like to test it again
This is the phone
As soon as we take it here you  will see that the charging has started
This is how AirCharge  technology works here
We will get to see this in  the market very soon
And who knows we might get 30W 50W  60W fast charging through AirCharge in the future
And before I go I will give  you an exclusive news
It is being said that Infinix will launch a  flagship smartphone very soon
Many people complain that Infinix  does not launch flagship smartphones
Why dont they do it?
So we have come to their booth

For unboxing the merchandise of your favorite youtubers sold by them
Here i have the overlays box
Since I started unboxing on this channel
many people commented things like these
i speak in tech burners style
i talk like a tech burner
Dont copy tech burner
And one person keeps commenting on each video
Tech burners of men fashion
but on a true note your any comment does not hurt me
bcoz if you attach gangadhar with truth
then it will become shaktiman only
its a compliment!
in the box of overlays you will get its brand name on the top
thier logo!
with the website name!
here its written Unbox the desire
nothing else
The box is made of cardboard
looks like a very sustainable material
afterwards you can use at is as a gift wrap for your relatives
After you open the box you get to see burnt hakka noodles
a card from team overlays and the rest you can read over here
you get a tag of overlays on the tshirt with a piece of paper that is cut and stuck on
the colour of the tshirt is white with no design its a solid tshirt
now lets talk about the fabric because this is the only thing that makes this tshirt
the fabric is cotton and is known as waffled textured cotton
this means that the entire body of the tshirt is made like waffles
if you have eaten a waffle or not it looks like this
the pattern is like this
similarly the pattern is made
The first thing is that it is very breathable
literally if you look like this you have got many seethrough holes
this makes a lot of air to come in and makes you comfortable
you can use it as a channi for karwachauth also when your spouse dont get a channi!
your karwachauth will be complete!
this tshirt is very stretchable bringing squeeziness inside your body
the cloth grabs your body
out of hundred things the cloth looks definitely premium
looking down you get a patch of brand overlays
i found 2 to 3 things missing in this tshirt which i will tell you later on
talking about the look it is white suits for very occassion time and season
just looks perfect!
so here we have the next tshirt!
if you remember overlays first launch!
in that overlays
hypily the word supima cotton usage was used
worlds finest cotton was being used
so continuing that thing these fabrics are also designed in the same way
that waffle one was not the supima cotton
first of all if you purchase this tshirt the first thing you will feel is the weight
of this tshirt
compared to other tshirts which you shop around from other brands
the t shirt is very heavy and the thickness of
and the quaity of the cloth is very nice
the same tag is present over here
The name of the tshirt is a variant white and black oversized tshirt
the price written over here is 1699 which means 1700 is the mrp
it is sold nearby to thousand rupees
it is also a full white t shirt in the front
but the designing in the corners and at the neck area is made of black
which is a stripped design
but can you tell whom you remember by looking at this tshirt?
the only thing is the middle design is shifted to the corner design
overall it looks like a benten tshirt only
down you get the branding of overlays which is attached through a rubber patch
in the neck area you get one more overlays tag attached with L size written
sings song
talking about the t shirt one thing that increases the level of experience is
the fabric of the tshirt is thick and is very dense
in this tshirt 230 is used
if you dont know what is this?
basically the thickness of the fabric is measured
to check the thickness of the fabric so in this tshirt the fabric thickness is
so in this 230 gsm is used and literally
the premium texture will be felt by you
the fabric is very stretchy inspite of being cotton
stretches like elastic
if you want to know my reviews on this tshirt then you will have to watch the video till
the end
now lets move to the next amazing tshirt
so here we have the tshirt
you must have watched people wearing the same tshirt
The name of the tshirt is messed it!
which means a mess is created!
we get a tag of overlays
mrp is 1599 but you have to very less amount if the product will be left or not
this tshirt is oversized and come with a design of multiple patch work
with multiple colours in it
one side you will have a lot of dark grey
another side little bit of cream color
another side is the blue color
the neckline is black in colour
not only with the difference in colour patches but you get different fabric material with
each color
the whole tshirt is from supima but the texture and feeling is different from one another
the 4 patches you see over here is
this dedicates to any sign of space
its that alien which tried to communicate with others
who threw the stone?
down you have the branding of overlays
at the back of the neck we have the overlays branding
the next thing you will notice is
that not only through the colour it is made but the fabrics are properly cut and stitched
to make this tshirt
definitely it took a lot of work for sure
the grey part you see here
these fabrics is made at 230 gsm
moreover the texture is a little bit rough according to me
if you have to wear comfy wear then these blue and cream part feels the same
t shirt is very good very comfortable and nice fitting and is a oversized tshirt
it matches with the trend indeed
lets move to the next tshirt!
we bought 5 tshirts and here we have another box with burnt hakka noodles in it
we talked to the team of overlays clothing at their old launch
but dont know what happened after that but this is not a sponsored video
i have purchased all these products with my own money so that i show you
and i get to experience about everything
this white tshirtb which you saw at the beginning
with the same design the same cloth and the same waffle fabric
the only thing is it has different elements
In the front we have a pocket with a thread design on the sides
The colour of the thread is grey with the same grey neckline with more thread designs
at the back
at the end of the sleeves you have grey borders
and this tshirt is designed as an oversized fit
the name of the tshirt is a white waffle oversized tshirt with olive rib
the team says it is as an olive green tshirt but it looks grey to me and us
maybe it has some magic inside
the mrp of this tshirt is 1399 but you dont have to pay this much
i dont have more to say about this tshirt if we talk about looks?
again its a very fine tshirt the broll will tell you how am i looking in this tshirt
next we move to the last tshirt!
by the grace of the god we will also do such things one day!
lets open the next tshirt the name of the tshirt is
its a full black tshirt
with some grey design in the middle
about that i will explain
lets talk about the price the price written here is 1399 which you dont have to pay
tag with overlays branding
inside you have a patch of overlays down you have one more small patch
this tshirt is also made of supima fabrics
definitely the thickness its the same very good
and this tshirt is made at 222
222 gsm made
it has a round neck and short sleeves
you dont get a lot of design in it
a runway sort of thing is made on the tshirt and some strokes on the sleeve is made
thus this is a small design element which looks cool
these tshirts speak more of the quality and not the designs
might happen you dont like the design on the website but when you
touch it you will feel a different experience
that you never have hold such a piece of cloth neither wore it
if you loved watching these tshirts then you can like it and go
lets talk about the pros and cons
pros is the cloth of these tshirts are of very good quality
and literally any youtuber or any website will never serve these premium clothes
from packaging to the clothes there were no use of plastic
i found that  a very good thing!
lets talk about the cons
now all the cons i will be talking about is
they are not cons but improvements
which the company can hear as a customer advice
about what they can improve and what not?
the first problem which i found was
that in any cloth among these 5 there is no instructions given about
the fabric like the type of fabric? is that supima or anything else?
the second thing was the body fitting was good but
but the sleeves were not so flattering and looks as if they were running
if i have wore this tshirt and the sleeve is running
then this thing personally does not looks good
the tshirt mounting freely doesnt look nice

Jai hind!
thank you
Friends today we have brought for you an exclusive unboxing of iQOO Neo 9
which can be called iQOO Neo 9 Pro in India
which will have Snapdragon 8 Gen 2
In China there were two variants Neo 9 and Neo 9 Pro
The Pro variant of China had Dimensity 9300
But the Neo 9 of China is Snapdragon 8 Gen 2
So the Neo 9 Pro in India will be with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2
Big confusion
Now friends the interesting thing is that you get Android 14 Origin OS with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2
and we hope that iQOO brings Origin OS in India
because we have tested it and matched it with Funtouch OS
and what difference we have seen you will see everything in this video
Now the box is like this the box of the Indian variant can be completely different
In the box you get a bag case 120W adapter Type C cable everything
Now we will keep this box at the back
Now lets talk about the design and build of the phone
So here you get 834mm thickness and 190 grams
So the weight and thickness of this phone is quite acceptable
and in boxy style you will get to see it in a square shape
You get to see rounded edges here
and at the back you get this dual texture design and leather bag
You will get the feel of leather here
and I got to know that the other colors dont have leather
Rest the design is completely different and the phone looks great
It feels good that iQOO gives some different combinations when it comes to leather
Rest you get to see the frames in plastic
Below you can put dual nano sims
You get a mic hole Type C port one speaker below
and one speaker above at earpiece
So dual stereo speakers are provided here
Rest you get a mic hole and IR blaster above
On the right you get a power button volume up and down key
and under display fingerprint scanner
Now the unlock system of the origin OS was very fast
As soon as we unlock it it opens up quickly
and the animation was also very different
When we compared it with the funtouch OS
So we saw a lot of difference in its animation and its animation
and this unlock was very fast
Its haptics are very different it has an Xaxis linear motor
Multitasking is very good at different places
The fun was very different there
I forgot to say one thing you also get IP54 ratings
For performance it has Snapdragon 8 Gen 2
and I liked this thing that iQOO decided to put two variants in China one with MediaTek and othere is with Snapdragon
but they have decided to put only Snapdragon variant in India
They know that the audience of Snapdragon is more
They did the same in iQOO Neo 7 Pro
They gave Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1
iQOO Neo 9 Pro is coming with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2
I liked this thing very much
This is officially confirmed
The performance is top notch
This is the flagship chipset of 2023
Now it has come to the upper midrange category
The Antutu scores were amazing around 16 million
The CPU throttling was very good 79 being a Chinese variant
Still it was seated at 44 degrees Celsius
But I am sure that when it comes to India
so we will not see such high thermals in the Indian variant
LPDDR5X UFS4 is also a big upgrade
and the app openclose multitasking
It is smooth as it has Origin OS
We noticed that we have iQOO 12 with Funtouch OS 14
It has Funtouch OS 14 and Android 14
Both have Android 14
Let me show you the difference between Origin OS and Funtouch OS 14
All the apps are closed here
We have only Call of Duty here
If I give you a comparison of both the animations and speed
It is very close
dont forget that we have Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in iQOO 12
even after that it is almost close
In fact if I open the gallery app it is very close
But we noticed one thing
If I close all the apps in it
And when I bring Funtouch OS 13
There is a difference
If I open this now we will see
Now we will know how fast Origin OS is
You will see the loading speed in front of you
So I have seen the difference here in Origin OS
There are many other things that we will talk about software in this
But overall experience is amazing
You can play gaming on high graphics
And there is 4D Vibration so when I was playing the game
the haptics that I was getting here
It was amazing
They have done this very well
And they have given dedicated Q1 chip
Which works in both performance and display
Lets talk about the display
You get 67 inch with 15k resolution
In an LTPO AMOLED display
It gives you a 144 Hz high refresh rate
In fact its smoothness was better
Because this is Origin OS
You cant judge this because it is Chinese varient
Who knows they might bring Origin OS in India
And optimize it separately
But I am not sure that it will come with Origin OS
But it is good if it comes
But its smoothness when we compared it with Funtouch OS 13
It was very fast
You get 3000 nits peak brightness
Outdoor visibility was very good
View angles were also very good
Its panel is used very well
punch hole is in centre you get very less chin
And it is a flat display not a curved display
And as I told you Q1 in display is also given
which is the extra chip
Frame rate interpolation you got that everything here
Overall display panel is used very well
For software it has Android 14
And it is based on Origin OS
Which is for China
I recommend it for India as well
I have told you in two things
that how fast it is in multitasking and swipes
Apart from that its dialer is different
If we compare it with Funtouch OS
Notification panel is completely different
When we matched it
Smoothness overall has improved
Animation has also improved
If you look at the notification panel carefully
You get to see it transparent
App opens speed is fast
Game loading speed is fast
Text has been highlighted
Animation pattern lock is also different
In fact when you unlock the phone
It is also different
Here I am noticing that there is a lot of difference
Between Funtouch and Origin
This is my experience
We recommend to iQOO that they should bring it
And you also go and tell iQOO
That bring Origin OS
It will be fun
Camera is impressive
You have 50MP primary sensor
IMX 920 is given
It is very good
It comes with OIS
and max you can shoot 8k video at 30fps
It also has an ultra wide sensor
But they have done a good job
that no 2MP game is played apart from that
Slow motion is at FHD 240 fps
You can shoot good slow motion videos
Night mode features
Portrait features everything is here
and 20x zoom in photo given
10x zoom in video
as for selfie you get 16MP selfie
FHD 30fps I dont like it
they still stuck at FHD
4K should be in selfie
well it is Chinese variant so cant be judged
still i am showing you some photos
it is good photo portrait is good
Dynamic range is good rear and selfie both are good there is no problem
video Stabilization is good
You can see in rear selfie
I have left the link on google drive
Indian variant has different optimization
then we can judge in detail
Battery is 5160 mAh
Capacity is a bit high
They have maintained the phone well
It is slim
120W adapter is given in the box
You can charge it in 25 minutes
We tested battery drain
We left 8K video recording for 15 hours at 100 at the morning 8 am
when we checked it at 10 am it was 72
It is quite impressive
because 8K video takes a lot of resources
Even hotspot takes a lot of resources
You should test more in these 2 things
Overall battery results were good
But I wont come to conclusion because it is Chinese varient
You will get 5G connectivity
in India you will get multiple 5G bands
But you get WiFi 7
Bluetooth version 53 and NFC is also given
It will definitely retain in India
You get support of all sensors
Lets talk about prices
It is quite aggressive
You wont believe
It is launched in China under 30K
It starts around 26K
and with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage
It has Snapdragon 8Gen2
It has many other features also
It has higher variants like 16256 16512 161TB
But pricing is quite aggressive
I can guess that maybe it will be around 35K in India
I have expectations from iQOO
Because they have aggressive pricing
I think iQOO Neo 9 Pro will come around that price
I am just speculating
I dont have any confirmation
You comment below and tell us what its price should be
Overall phone is good
It is Chinese variant
but i am waiting for Indian variant
You should also wait for our Indian variant varient unboxing
Because there is a big difference between Chinese and Indian varient
