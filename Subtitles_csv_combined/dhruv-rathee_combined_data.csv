Hello friends!
Last month more than 30000 people gathered in Ladakh to protest
Watch these videos
It may not seem like a huge number
But here 30000 means
more than 10 of the population of this Union territory
Everyone was gathered at one place
to protest for their rights
On 6th March
when the discussions with the government did not yield any result
the famous educator innovator and activist
Sonam Wangchuk decided to go on an indefinite fast
Im going on an indefinite fast
until Ladakhs voice is heard
Until the government pays attention to Ladakh
A 21day fast
which can become a fast till deth
Think about it if in any state in our country
10 of the population takes to the streets protesting
will it not be a huge news?
But the way this news is being suppressed by the news channels
it is very shocking to see
We will talk about the demands of the protesters later in the video
but in the video I would also like to show you
that story isnt unique to Ladakh
This story is playing out in every corner of the country today
The political corporate mafia that is putting Ladakh in danger today
is the same mafia that destroyed the forests of Hasdeo
set fire to the hills of Manipur
and is bent on destroying Buxwaha
The same mafia that is causing Joshimath to sink
that caused the tunnel collapse in Uttarkashi
and put Lakshadweep in danger
If this mafia is not stopped
it will slowly devour the country like a termite
It will make it hollow from within
Lets understand this in todays video
Friends if you dont know Sonam Wangchuk
then it is important to tell you that
he is the person who inspired
the character of Rancho in the film 3 Idiots
The innovations made by Rancho in the film
Sonam Wangchuk made similar innovations and more in real life
In 2021 he built these environmentfriendly solar heated tents for the Indian Army
With these tents our soldiers
were able to stay comfortably even in the freezing cold of Ladakh
Apart from this Sonam Wangchuk
has also designed many carbon neutral solar buildings in Ladakh
He was the one to introduce the concept of Ice Stupas
To deal with the water shortage in Ladakh
he introduced this concept
of building these artificial glaciers
Throughout the years he has been awarded many awards for his innovations
Be it the Ramon Magsaysay Award
the Green Teacher Award
or an award by the UNESCO
So today when this Sonam Wangchuk
is sitting on an indefinite fast
it must be because of a serious problem
The problem is the democracy in Ladakh
the environment of Ladakh
and the rights of the people of Ladakh
The people of Ladakh have four main demands
First including Ladakh in the 6th Schedule of the Constitution
Second giving full statehood to Ladakh
Third electing 2 MPs from Ladakh
Currently theres only 1 MP is from Ladakh in the Lok Sabha
and 0 MPs in the Rajya Sabha
And fourth establishing a Public Service Commission to provide secure jobs in Ladakh
Lets understand each of them in detail
First what is this 6th Schedule?
This is the part of the Constitution
that protects the tribal population in the country
According to this in tribal areas
to promote democracy the tribal people
can form their own Autonomous District Councils
and Autonomous Regional Councils
Also known as ADCs and ARCs
They are basically elected bodies
that have the power to administer tribal areas
So that on a local level the tribal people
make their rules about their land forest and sociocultural customs
So that people from outside cannot exploit their land and resources
Today this 6th Schedule is applicable
in the tribal areas of Assam Meghalaya Tripura and Mizoram
Now you might think since there are no forests in Ladakh
why are the people of Ladakh demanding it?
There are three main reasons for this
First it is true that there arent forests in Ladakh
but every area has its natural biodiversity
And Sonam Wangchuk has explained this many times
that the area of Ladakh
is very vulnerable considering climate change
The mountains are facing the wrath of nature
in the face of climate change
If the resources are allowed to be exploited in this area
it will be largely dangerous for Ladakh
The frequency of natural disasters flash floods and landslides will increase
Second the majority population of Ladakh
falls in the Scheduled Tribes category
According to NCST
668 of the population of Leh is Scheduled Tribe
83 in Kargil
and in some areas it is as high as 99
The third and the biggest reason
the 6th Schedule will give the people of Ladakh their democratic rights
Today what do the people of Ladakh have in terms of democracy?
Think about it yourself
Since the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019
Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir were divided into a separate Union Territories
People didnt have any issues with the abrogation of Article 370
rather their issues are with the actions of the government after the abrogation
JK used to be a full state
After 2019 it was downgraded
and divided into two separate Union Territories
This is what JKs former Governor Satyapal Malik had said
More than the abrogation of Article 370
they feel bad about this
Absolutely so why did you do this?
I didnt play any part in this
Had they asked I would have warned them against it
JKs Union Territory did get its Legislative Assembly
But Ladakh wasnt given that right
Before 2019 when JK used to be a full state
there were 4 MLAs from Ladakh
But today this number has come down to zero
Delhi is also a Union Territory
but there exists a state level government
You can vote for them you can elect them
Now its a different issue that
the Central Government has tried
its best to take away powers from the Delhi Government
over the last few years
But Ladakh wasnt given this right at all
There are no offices at the state level
that you can elect by voting
At the next level
people of Ladakh can vote for the Lok Sabha elections only
but even there
they have been given only 1 MP
This is the reason behind all these demands
On a local level they want to be included in the 6th Schedule
so that they can elect their ADCs and ARCs
and can protect their land
On a state level they want full statehood
But if that isnt possible
they want at least a Legislative Assembly
so that they can elect their government
And on a central level
they want to have 2 MPs
Otherwise this is only a shell of democracy?
Friends the most interesting thing is that
it doesnt matter whether
you agree with my reasoning or not
Because 4 years ago
BJP was the one to demand
that Ladakh be included in the 6th Schedule
What could be the reason
that BJP doesnt want to fulfil this demand now?
Its an interesting reason
and quite predictable
if you understand BJPs politics
I will talk about this reason in a while
but before that if you want to understand the Indian Constitution properly
then I would like to recommend this audiobook on Kuku FM
Bhartiya Samvidhan Ankahi Kahani
It explains in detail how our countrys great Constitution was actually drafted
The history behind it
If you dont know Kuku FM
it is an audio learning platform
on which you can find many such audiobooks
on almost all kinds of topics
Whether it is history politics fiction or selfhelp
Download it and try it yourself

Using that link you will get a whopping 70 discount!
Now lets get back to the topic
In fact not only a demand
right at the top of BJPs manifesto
they mentioned including Ladakh in the 6th Schedule
You can read what theyve clearly written in their manifesto
I have shown this earlier
today I will show it again
in 2019 during the Lok Sabha elections
in the third bullet point of you manifesto
you had promised to safeguard Ladakh in the 6th Schedule
September 2019 was the first time that
the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes had recommended
the inclusion of Ladakh in the 6th Schedule
But the government did not take any action
In August 2020 the people of Ladakh
put their demands in front of the government for the first time
In September 2020
the first mass protest took place in Ladakh regarding this
In 2020 the Autonomous Hill District Council was to be elected in Ladakh
And before the elections Home Minister Amit Shah promised that
within 15 days of the election
they would fulfil these demands
After this the protests were called off
and BJP won the elections with 15 seats
But after that no action was taken
During December 2021 and November 2022 there were two more protests
For a while there were discussions with the government
but despite writing in on the manifesto
the government kept refusing to give in to their demand
This is the reason for this indefinite fast today
It didnt escalate all of a sudden
As you can see over the last few years
people have been raising their demands repeatedly
But the biggest question here is
What is Modi governments problem
with fulfilling this demand?
Adding the people of Ladakh to the 6th Schedule
will not bring the nation crumbling down
Its a simple demand
And there wont be any backlash for the Modi government or BJP if they do this
After all they were the ones to include this in their manifesto
What could be the reason behind this refusal?
I would like you to read a line about the functions of ADCs
Look at the screen
The district and regional councils
administer the areas under their jurisdiction
They can make laws on certain specified matters
like land forests canal water shifting cultivation
Did you notice it?
Lands Forests
This means that if Ladakh is added to the 6th Schedule
then the Modi government wont have power
over the Ladakhs land
This means that Ladakhs land and forests
cannot be sold be PM Modi to his friend
They wanted every valley here
to be mined and have industries set up
but Ladakhs people are wary of this
Sonam Wangchuk and Ladakhs people dont want
their lands to be opened up for corporate exploitation
Doing this will not mean taking away the rights of the people living there
but it will also be very dangerous for our countrys environment
Ladakh is a beautiful and ecologically sensitive part of our country
The mountains and valleys here are so unique that
you cant find such features anywhere else in the world
The worlds rarest and most endangered animal species are found here
Like the snow leopards or the Tibetan antelopes
The water of the lakes here is so crystal clear
you wont even believe that
such clarity can be found anywhere
And if you have ever been to Ladakh
then you must know how innocent and purehearted these people are
Their culture and tradition
these monasteries and festivals
are so amazing that
people from all over the world come to see them
I believe that it is every Indians duty
to protect the environment and cultural diversity of a place like Ladakh
Places like these are like precious gems in our country
But the way our government is treating these precious gems today
tells you a lot about the governments intention
How long has it been since Manipur is on fire?
Its in a state of civil war
and PM Modi is not willing to even visit that state
And the reason for Manipurs terrible situation
is corporate exploitation
I explained it in this video
Theres deforestation of the Hasdeo jungle in Chhattisgarh
People made countless reels to protect the forest
But the government opened it up for mining
Who is benefiting from this?
The people?
Or Prime Ministers friends at the top?
This story isnt about Ladakh Manipur or Hasdeo only
On a large scale they are trying to
sell the forests of the country
To sell our mountains
and to sell our land
And the benefit from the corporate exploitation
goes to a select few at the top of hierarchy
If you still cant see the connection
click here to watch this video
Youll understand this funda thoroughly
Thank you very much!
Is democracy over in our country?
This is a very serious question
Many of you will have a  simple answer to this question
Obviously not
We can vote for any political party we want
The politician who gets the most votes
comes in power
so obviously democracy still exists in our country
But this question is much deeper than that
The things that I am going to  show you in this video today
will be very shocking
After watching this video you will be forced to think
about the real answer to this question
Although if you are someone
that considers PM Modi to be a god
He is our god
We worship him
Prime Minister Modi  he is Gods incarnation to us
He is not a normal human
This countrys Prime Minister is the incarnation of Lord Vishnu
God incarnate
Or if you are someone
who thinks that Modis every action helps humanity
if youre already in awe of PM Modi
Modi is my husband  my brother my father my teacher
Okay What do you want to say?
Why do you feel like no one other than  Modi or Yogi can bring development?
I am in love with him
In such cases
it might be difficult for you
to open your eyes and look at the truth
But for the rest of the viewers
if you truly care about the country
watching this video is immensely important
Its not just about one incident
but many such incidents
that are happening one after the other
for the past few months  for the past few years
All those incidents point to one thing
that our country is moving forward towards One Nation One Party
Eradicating the voice of the opposition from the media
horsetrading of the MLAs
the taking away power from the elected governments
by making new laws
Weaponisation of investigative agencies
Pressuring and imprisoning  opposition politicians through ED and CBI
Interfering in state governments work through governors
Withholding funds from state governments
Taking away the right of the citizens to protest
And if someone protests
welcoming them with tear gas and rubber bullets
Using electoral bonds to hide their funding
And even if an opposition candidate manages to win the election
then committing election fraud  to declare themselves the winner
I would like to tell PM Modi
Have some decency!
Before talking about democracy friends
it is important to know what democracy actually is
It is a basic concept
but most people have a major  misunderstanding of this concept
Some people think that
if there are regular elections in the country
and you can go to vote
then it means that the country is a democratic country
But you know what?
Elections are held in North Korea too
I am not kidding
There are regular elections in North Korea
You can also see 100 voter turnout in those elections
But the only difference is that
if you do not vote for the official candidate elected by the government
you are considered antinational
Your job can be snatched away
your house can be snatched away
And if its just about the word democracy
then the official name of North Korea
the word democracy is included in it
North Korea is called the DPRK by their government
Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea
But what is the truth?
This country is a dictatorship
Similarly Russia is also considered a dictatorship
But elections are held there too
The only difference is that any candidate  who competes against Putin
is sometimes disqualified for some reason
or sometimes k!lled mysteriously
So one thing should be clear from this
merely having elections does not mean
that the country is a democracy
Elections need to be free and fair
Free means that the people have freedom
to vote for whom they want to
and Fair means that
different candidates and different political parties
have a fair chance of winning
It shouldnt be that one party has a lot of advantages
Recently the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation held its Mayor elections
For this election Congress and the AAP had formed an alliance
and had a total of 20 votes out of 35
It was clear by the party votes that
this alliance would win the elections
But when the elections actually took place
what did the presiding officer do?
This is not a secret
You can see the CCTV footage of what he did
He declared 8 Congress and AAP  votes as invalid
And this election fraud that took place here
was captured in the CCTV camera
In fact he was caught looking at the camera too
Look at his face
The way he is looking at the camera
it looks like he was caught stealing
And what was the result of the election?
BJP claimed to have won this election
Such an open election fraud
has probably never happened in the country before
The Chief Justice of India said that
this is a mrder of democracy
Although in a historic decision the Supreme Court
had to save this election
the question is
if there were no CCTV cameras here
or ballot papers
would this fraud have been caught?
This is just one example friends
Before that look at this news from 2021
An EVM machine was found in a BJP candidates car in Assam
After this the Election Commission had to order a repoll in this place
But no need to talk about old news
Look at this months news
February 2024
Three unknown people went to the Saswad Tehsil office in Pune
to steal the control unit of the electronic voting machine
Is this a joke?
Are our elections being conducted in a free and fair manner?
The Election Commission is an organisation
which is expected to conduct free and fair elections across the country
But the Election Commission has been accused
of being partial and biased
This accusation is very old
Initially BJP politician Narendra Modi had made this accusation
You heard it right
Before the May 2014 election
Narendra Modi accused the Election Commission
Although he won later elections
But in the last 10 years
the Election Commission has been accused so much that
Prashant Kishore said that
the Election Commission is an extension of BJP
He says that he has never seen such a  partial and biased Election Commission
That this Commission has always tried to bend the rules
And tried to make the schedule of elections in such a way that
BJP always benefits
The Election Commission has given very clear directions
that the Indian Army cannot be mentioned during political campaigns
But before the 2019 elections PM Modi
shamelessly asked for votes
using the martyrs and airstrikes
I want to ask my firsttime voters that
can your vote be dedicated to  the brave martyrs in Pulwama?
Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Adityanath went on to
call the Indian Army as Modis Army
And Modis army shts the terr0rists
When a complaint was filed with the  Election Commission regarding this
no action was taken for 21 days
And after 21 days the Election Commission gave its clean chit
The rules are clearly written
they are being openly violated
but still a clean chit
Its not the only clean chit
PM Modi has got such clean chits in at least 4 different cases
Amit Shah compared Rahul Gandhis constituency with Pakistan
This is also against the rules
But the Election Commission has given clean chits in this too
In total there are 7 such cases
in which Modi and Shah have received clean chits
NDTV had also reported that
one out of three election commissioners
had a dissenting opinion
in 5 out of the 7 cases
It means that there was an election commissioner
who believed that they should not be given clean chits
Later it was found that the name of this  election commissioner was Ashok Lavasa
Do you know what happened to him later?
His wife son daughter and sister all got  notices from the government agencies
The Citizen Commission on Elections in their report stated that
Ashok Lavasa was silently removed from the election commission
Just think this is an election commissioner
is this a democracy or a dictatorship?
In a democracy separation of powers
independence of institutions
is something you must have read about in school
Our Supreme Court had given an order
to strengthen the independence of the election commission
To have the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners
be appointed by a threemember committee
One of whom will be the Prime Minister
the other will be the opposition leader
and the third will be the Chief Justice of India
By doing this it could be ensured that
the Election Commissioner who is being appointed
will be truly independent
There will be no bias towards any entity
But a few months ago
the government brought in a new law
in which the government said that
the Chief Justice of India would be removed from this committee
Instead they added their minister to the committee
So in threemember committee
two of them will be from the government
to appoint the Election Commissioner
If BJPs intentions were clear
then why was such a law passed?
Why does the government want to control  the appointment of the Election Commissioner?
This was later challenged in the Supreme Court
but the Supreme Court did not take any action here
saying that this falls under the separation of powers
If the government is making a law
then the Supreme Court does not want to strike it
Even today the Election Commission has set a limit on
how much money can be spent on an MLA election and an MP election
In an MP election the limit is 95 million
BJP contested the election on 437 seats
So the total spending of the party
should not have been more than 415 billion
But how much did they spend?
It is written on the website of the Election Commission
1264 billion
how did the Election Commission allow this?
The Center for Media Studies also estimated that
BJP had spent 270 billion in the previous elections
Which was 45 of the total expenditure
If you look at the data of today
electoral bonds worth 160 billion have been sold
Out of these 160 billion  more than 100 billion went to BJP
15 billion to Congress
and 8 billion to TMC
All these amounts surpass the spending limit of the election
BJP leader Uma Bharti once said
Elections are a choice between bad and worse
Which is true
But think about it
If a social worker who has dedicated his life to serving people
how will he be able to bring 9 million to contest an election?
How will he be able to promote himself?
Especially when on the other side  the party has billions of rupees
The problem isnt limited to elections
Even if an opposition party forms the government
the government is then broken apart
Here countless allegations have been  levied against the BJP for horsetrading
People have repeatedly accused BJP
of taking MLAs to some resort
and buying them with an unimaginable amount of money
Are these allegations of horse trading true?
I cannot tell you because
I have never been to that resort
But you can imagine
all those MLAs in the resort wont be merely playing Ludo
Investigative agencies are responsible  for investigating such allegations
But if all the investigative agencies
dance to the tune of a single political party
then who will investigate these allegations?
Now imagine what would be going on in the MLAs homes
The politician who buys these MLAs
what would he say to his family?
Proudly telling them the good news
that he suppressed the voice of the people
That he strngled democracy
Hoping to be praised
And the other MLA who sold his soul for some money
what would he tell his family?
Proudly showing the money he brought in
By maligning the integrity of the nation by falling for horsetrading
Celebrating his lack of integrity
Its easy to get angry at such politicians
but theyre pitiful too
How miserable they are
how low they have fallen
Horsetrading and luring politicians with money is just one way
If an MLA doesnt fall for this
the second way is to use the investigative agencies
Using ED
weaponisation of ED
Last year 14 political parties had  complained to the Supreme Court
about how the government is using CBI and ED
against opposition leaders
They said that they have carried out  more than 3000 raids on political leaders
If you compare it with 2014
you can see a 4 fold jump in the number of ED cases against politicians
And 95 of the cases are registered against opposition parties
In response ED said that their conviction rate is very high
The conviction rate is 96
because the trials in 25 cases are over
and there was a conviction in 24 cases
But the truth is that from 2005 till now
ED has registered more than 5900 cases
The trial was conducted in only 25 cases
And the conviction was in only 24 cases
That translates to only 05 of the cases being substantial
Whenever an opposition politician is accused of corruption
and he joins BJP
all charges vanish suddenly
All cases against him are dropped
Someone had even written a poem on him
Washing Powder Modi
lies and frauds
it hides everything
even serious allegations disappear in a blink
When Himanta Biswa Sharma was in Congress
he was accused in the Saradha Chit Fund Scam
CBI called him for questioning in November 2014
And since 2015 when he joined BJP
7 more allegations of corruption have been filed against him
One allegation is about a land scam
another allegation is that he is running  syndicates in the silk and muga industry
But since he joined BJP
there have been no investigations on him
By the way the list of politicians who  went in BJPs washing machine is very long
Many of these politicians were previously  mentioned by PM Narendra Modi in his speeches
as examples of corruption
Calling NCP the Naturally Corrupt Party  and asking people to never vote for them
But as soon as these leaders joined BJP
the investigations stopped
and the corruption scams were forgotten
BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee had once said
where someone has to rely on corrupt individuals to gain power
he said that he wouldnt want to get near that power
If I get power
I dont even want to touch such power with a tong
But that era was completely different
That BJP and todays BJP
are vastly different
Today when Nitin Ghatkari is asked about Modis washing powder
he answers with a smile that
BJPs detergent is ecofriendly
Its important to win in elections
and the winner decides whats right or wrong
BJPs soap is washing away everyones scandals in a washing machine
Its an ecofriendly detergent
Whom do you agree with more?
Presentday Nitin Gadkari
or the former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee?
Comments below
Even despite the lure of money  and the pressure of ED
if an opposition politician doesnt join BJP
the proceedings against them continue
And in many cases
they are put in jail without being convicted
And they remain in jail for many months
AAP MP Raghav Chadda said that
if Manish Sisodia Satyendra Jain Abhishek Banerjee Sanjay Raut
Farooq Abdullah and Tejashwi Yadav join BJP
all the cases by ED and CBI against them
will be dismissed immediately
And people like Manish Sisodia and Satyendra Jain who are in jail
will be released immediately
Now to imprison someone after a conviction is a different matter
But here opposition politicians are being  sent to jail before they are convicted
The worst thing is that in the states where opposition governments exist
they are not allowed to work there
Not just one or two but many states have
repeatedly accused the Modi government that
they are using governors to interfere in the states daytoday affairs
They are preventing the state governments from working
The West Bengal government has said this
The West Bengal governor has been repeatedly blamed for this
The Tamil Nadu government has said this
The Delhi government has said this
The Kerala government has said this
Last year the Kerala government even accused the governor
of delaying the bills passed by the state government for 2 years
Delaying the bills approval
The state of Kerala even complained to the Supreme Court about this
The Supreme Court said that the governors cannot delay bills like this
That this is unconstitutional
The issue between the LG and the Delhi government in Delhi
has been in the news for many years
Over the last few years  CM Kejriwal has repeatedly said that
they are not allowed to work
The LG interferes in their work
The Delhi government approached the Supreme Court for this
and the Supreme Courts decision was in their favour
The Supreme Court stated that
LG should not interfere in this way
The real power should be in the hands of the elected government
But what did the Central Government do  after the Supreme Courts decision?
They brought a new law
to take away the powers of the Delhi government
Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Amendment Act 2023
The Modi government used this
to transfer many powers vested with  the Delhi government to the LG
We changed the hospitals
We made them grand
We arranged for all the medicines
They forced the officers to disrupt the flow of medicines
They stopped the tests
Last year for three months no tests could be run in the mobile clinics
They stopped the payments to the laboratories
They play dirty and are disgusting people
By passing one order one day
they removed the data entry operator  in all the government hospitals in Delhi
Now there is no one left to register patients in the hospitals
I ask them what do you want to do?
Do you want to k!ll the people of Delhi?
Think about it yourself friends
Even if you are a Modi fan
forget about him for a second
and ask yourself sincerely
If PM Modi was really worried about the country
the people of the country
would he have done such things?
Now some of you will think that
surely some opposition party has funded me to make this video
But I am telling you the truth
no political party has funded me
The things that I am showing you in this video
represents the reality of the country
If you are really concerned about the country
then you should open your eyes after seeing these things
News Laundry revealed an investigation report two days ago
that shows ED is used not only against other political parties
but also against companies in the country
At least 23 such companies which
hadnt donated any money to BJP yet
Central agencies raid their premises
and a pattern emerges
After the raid those companies donated millions of rupees to BJP
In total these companies donated 335 billion to BJP
which were subjected to IT or ED raid
So were these companies threatened to extort money?
Are our elections held in a free and fair manner?
Here the media also plays an important role too
Fair elections mean that the politicians of  the ruling party and the opposition
are given an equal chance to speak
Both get more or less equal media coverage
But what do we see in the media?
Day and night 247 the media sings praises the government
They praise the ruling party
Or repeat their talking points
Every mother in the country wants her son to be like PM Modi
and every son wants to be like Narendra Modi
Modi has the solution to everything
Theres no one like PM Modi
Modi built the New India
PM 1
Opposition parties may go on a Bharat Jodo Yatra
to make promises to the government
There was a time when on Doordarshan
the politicians of the ruling party and the opposition party
debated on important issues before the election on the news channel
Both had the right to defend their stance
Can today Doordarshan do this?
Today the BJP spokesperson doesnt even need to speak
because TV anchors have become BJP spokespersons
Instead of questioning the government on behalf of the people
they defend the government
And they defend the government to an extent that
they might start to hold the youth  responsible for increasing unemployment
And if you have elected an opposition party in the elections
then they will start insulting the people
And the people have turned away  from the national issues and BJP
They choose to vote based on
which party will give them free stuff
NDTV was the last TV channel
which dared to question the government
Ultimately NDTV was taken over by PM Modis friend Gautam Adani
Today TV news has d!ed a silent deth in our country
The government uses tax money to
give huge amounts of money to these TV  channels for running advertisements
and these TV channels work to suppress the voices of the citizens
If the real news doesnt reach you
will you be able to decide freely and fairly who to vote for?
Manipur was set ablaze for 77 days
but there were no special reports on TV channels
Recently the CAG of India presented 12 reports
which had a lot of irregularities
and instances of corruption
in government departments and ministries
Under the Ayushman Bharat scheme  more than 900000 people
were using only 3 mobile numbers
Millions of rupees were spent on the treatment of 3400 patients
who were already declared dead
When this CAG report came out
the government transferred the CAG officers
Have you heard this news on TV channels?
You havent
How will it reach you?
The second misunderstanding that people have is
they confuse democracy with majoritarianism
Imagine that you are travelling in a car with 5 people
One person in the car says that he wants to listen to loud music
He convinces his friend and the driver
that they should play loud music in the car
But you are travelling with your father who has a heart problem
You say that loud music should not be played
That person says that all of you should  vote to prove that its a democracy
And three people voted that loud music should be played
Your father and you are the two people  who say that loud music shouldnt be played
Since the majority voted to play loud music
in a democracy it would mean that loud music will be played in the car
Is this really democracy?
No this is stupidity
To give you a smallscale example in real life
then look at this circular from a society in Gurgaon
Dear Residents This is to inform you that
two wheeler not permitted inside our society
as per decision of the management
It means that only cars will enter the society
scooters and motorcycles cannot
Look at the unabashed discrimination
The management the RWAs
have been elected by the people
So even if you dont like this rule you would need to keep quiet
Because the majority has consented to this
they have elected the RWLO
People who confuse democracy and majoritarianism
must be thinking this
This is not just about one society
there are many such societies all over the country
where you will find such stupid rules if not stupider
Look at this article from 2019
A bank employee is saying that her sister didnt get an apartment on rent
Because many RWOs blacklisted her
just because her sister was an air hostess
Some societies say that they cant rent an apartment to an air hostess
because of their odd work timings
Often these RWAs make up any baseless rule they want to
For example in some societies in Noida
entry and exit fees have been imposed
Anyone who wants to rent an apartment in these societies
will have to pay an entry fee
And they will of course be required to pay the rent to the landlord
but when they leave the society
they have to pay an exit fee
The majoritarianism at the local level in the country
Some people think this about politicians and governments
Once the politicians are elected and they are in power
they can make any rule they want
On the Preamble to our Constitution
4 words are clearly written
Liberty Equality Fraternity and Justice
These 4 words are the cornerstones of democracy
In fact Dr Ambedkar went one step further
He said that these 4 words are the principles of life
So a majority vote doesnt mean that
you can take away someones natural rights
discriminate against them or make nonsense rules
This is why we can say that some of the decisions taken by the government
go against democracy
In the language of the Supreme Court
they are unconstitutional
Like just a few days ago
the Supreme Court struck down the Electoral Bonds Scheme
calling it unconstitutional
The court said that the government had made an arbitrary rule
Why was this Electoral Bonds Scheme unconstitutional
and against the welfare of the people?
I have talked about this in previous videos
So it was a good step by the Supreme Court
even though the decision was a bit late
but at least the took the right decision
in favour of democracy and the people
But holding the government accountable
is not only the Supreme Courts responsibility
but in a real democracy
this is the job of the opposition
media civil society and the citizens
And for this reason
mechanisms like RTI Right to Information Act exits
Which gives us data about the government
For the same reason the media is called the fourth pillar of democracy
so that it will hold the government accountable
But what is the situation today?
Till date PM Modi has held zero press conferences
where unscripted questions have been asked
Accountability is at absolute zero
Forget the press conference
he doesnt have the courage to face one unscripted question
When Dr Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister
he held press conferences or addressed the press at least 117 times
The last time a proper press conference was held in our country
by the Prime Minister
it has been more than 10 years since that day
In that last press conference
62 unscripted questions were asked to PM Dr Manmohan Singh
with more than 100 journalists present
In a true democracy
this accountability is the reason
which gives the citizens the right to protest
If the managers elected by our country
are not interested in being held accountable under the RTI
arent comfortable with being accountable to the media
then they will have to be held accountable by the citizens
A positive example of this was recently seen in UP
when the UP government made a very strange and undemocratic rule
They issued guidelines for coaching centres
that they should not conduct classes for girls after 8 pm
If they do action will be taken against them
And what was the governments justification?
That it was necessary for the safety of girls
But does this make any sense?
Instead of controlling the ones who are a threat to girls
instead of controlling the problematic elements
they tried to put the girls in cages
protested against these rules
And after the protest
the UP government withdrew the ban
This small incident shows
the power of the people in a democracy
But what if the right to protest is taken away from people?
Recently when farmers had to go back to the streets to protest again
the government welcomed them with sharp nails
In some places roads were dug
to completely block the roads
Then rubber bullets were fired at the farmers
tear gas was thrown at them using drones
As if this was a war zone
The photos of the border crossing made it look like
this was the national border with China
Even there there are no arrangements like this
And in the news it is being reported that
at least 3 farmers went blind
because of the rubber bullets fired by the police
We will talk about the reasons behind this protest
and the demands of the farmers
in a separate video
But for now this doesnt matter
The point here is that
the government treating citizens peacefully protesting like this
Is this right?
Before this there was the wrestlers protest
The police behaved similarly back then too
This was the case in the last farmer protest too
Numerous farmers lost their lives during the protest
According to an article from 2021
at least 600 farmers were killed in the last farmers protest
And these are the protests that you get to hear about in the news
because these protests have gotten bigger than a certain limit
Apart from this most of the protests that were held over the last few years
have never been talked about in the news
Did you know about Kashmiri Pandits protests that lasted more than 40 days?
About the government employees protesting against the old pension scheme?
Or the protest in Hisar that continued for more than 400 days?
Against the closing of the Doordarshan Kendra
Or the doctors protest last year
or the protest by the unemployed youth
Dont delude yourself that this has nothing to do you
since you are not taking part in these protests
Because tomorrow if you are subjected to any injustice
if the government takes any decision
that goes against your rights
And you go out to protest to defend your rights
What do you think?
Wont you be treated the same way
these farmers are being treated today?
Are you special?
If the government is treating all the protesters this way
then you wont get any special privilege
Now this question that I asked you at the beginning of the video
I would like to ask again
Is democracy still alive in the country today?
Whatever your answer may be
but one thing is for sure
if the situation continues to deteriorate this way
it will not take much time for us to fall  to the levels of North Korea and Russia
Democracy will exist on paper
elections will also be held
but in the real sense
democracy will have breathed its last breath
24th November 1971
In America a Northwest Orient Airlines flight
took off from Portland
This is a small 30minute flight
to Seattle city nearby
Not many passengers were on this flight
It was carrying only 36 passengers  and 6 crew members
But these passengers were unaware that
a hijacker was present on this flight
A man named DB Cooper
The hijacker looked like a normal businessman
He was dressed like that
A business suit white shirt and black pants
He must have been in his midforties
He intentionally sat in the last row of the plane
Seat number 18E
As soon as the plane took off
this guy introduced himself to an air hostess
He mentions his name Dan Cooper
The hostesss name was Florence Schaffner
And with a big smile he handed a note to the air hostess
Schaffner was a 23yearold woman
who thought that this man was trying to flirt with her
So she took that note
and kept it with her without reading it
Seeing this Cooper told her
that she should read the note
He said that he had a b0mb
When Schaffner opened the note
it was clearly written in neat handwriting
Miss I have a b0mb in my briefcase
and I want you to sit by me
Schaffner quietly sat next to Cooper
but she still couldnt believe that
he actually had a bomb
So Cooper opened his suitcase to show it to her
Some red cylinders wires
and a big cylindrical battery were in the suitcase
There was no doubt that it was a b0mb
Cooper made his demands to the air hostess
He wanted 200000 by 5 pm that evening
That too in cash
He wanted all that cash in a bag
along with 2 parachutes in the back  and 2 parachutes in the front
When they eventually landed
he wanted to have a fuel truck ready to refuel the plane
He warned her against trying anything strange
threatening to blow up the plane otherwise
The other passengers on the plane were unaware of this
and Air Hostess Schaffner didnt want
the other passengers to know
She quietly went into the cockpit
and showed Coopers note to the pilots
Another Air Hostess Tina Mucklow was informed about this
and she sat beside Cooper
With the help of these two air hostesses
the contact between the planes cockpit  and Cooper could be maintained
The pilots informed the air traffic controller
and soon the news reached the president of the airline
Donald Nairob
He was the decisionmaker
and he made an interesting decision
He told the staff to ensure full compliance with Coopers demands
To fulfil all demands made by this hijacker
After coordinating with the FBI
he talked to a Seattle bank to arrange the money
The bank had a huge bundle of  money for such emergencies
But there was something special about this bundle of money
We will talk about it later in the video
But you must be wondering
why did the airlines president
decide to cooperate with the hijackers?
The reason behind this was Reputation
The airlines president didnt want
the news of the hijack to spread all over the world
leading to heavy losses for his company
So to keep this issue under wraps
he was willing to fulfil the demands of the hijackers
The only problem was that
they needed some time to arrange the money
but this flight was only supposed to be half an hour long
So the pilots were told that
instead of landing the plane
they were to keep circling around Seattle
until they could arrange the money on the ground
This halfhour flight gradually became 3 hours long
Passengers were still unaware of what was happening
Flight pilots announced that
they were facing minor technical difficulties
causing the delay
The other passengers believed this
Finally this flight landed at  Seattles airport at 546 pm
According to Coopers instructions
the plane was parked far from the main terminal building
One airline representative approached the plane
with a bag of money and the parachutes
When the 4 parachutes and the bag of money
was given to Cooper
he allowed the passengers and flight attendants
to leave the plane
except Tina Mucklow
After this according to the plan the plane was refuelled
and it takes off again
This time only the pilots were on the plane
along with Cooper and Tina
Cooper started giving instructions to the pilots again
For the destination of the flight the speed of the flight
down to the very angle
He directs them to fly the plane towards Mexico City
At an altitude of 10000 feet in the air
With the wings positioned at 15
As for the planes speed
he wanted to fly as slow as possible
The pilots told Cooper that
flying with these configurations
would make it difficult for them to reach Mexico City
Because there wasnt enough fuel in the plane
But Cooper was not worried about it
Cooper told them to fly as he directed
Friends what happened next is completely unbelievable
No less than a films story
Cooper told Tina to go to the cockpit and lock the door
Cooper was the only person outside the cockpit
He took out his parachutes and prepared to dive
A few minutes later
a warning light flashed in the cockpit
indicating that the rear staircase had been deployed
This was a unique feature in these planes back then
Boeing 727 planes had an aft staircase at the back
In the photos you can see how
the stairs deployed from the back
Cooper deployed these stairs
and jumped out with the parachutes and the money
The pilots and the air hostesses did not see this happening
because they were locked in the cockpit
and back then there was no hole on the cockpit door
through which they could see outside
But at 813 pm pilots noticed that
the back part of the plane suddenly tilted upwards
and the pilots had to recalibrate and relevel the plane
After this the pilots flew the plane to Nevada  and landed in the city of Reno
The police were informed
and they investigated the plane
But they didnt find any trace of Cooper
The only things the police could find was a tie
with a clip on it
and some torn parts of the parachutes
which Cooper had used to cover the bag of money
Apart from this they found some personal items belonging to Cooper
like the cigarettes he was smoking on the plane
Smoking was allowed in aeroplanes back then
Investigators investigated everything thoroughly
and they found 66 unidentified fingerprints
Fingerprints belonging to neither the crew members
nor to the other passengers
But the suitcase that had the b0mb
the bag of money and the parachutes
were all missing like Cooper
From that day the FBI started its investigation to find Cooper
but no trace of Cooper was found
This investigation went on for 45 years
It was officially closed in 2016
but the answers to many questions
are still unanswered
This is the only hijack in history
that no one has been able to solve
One of the greatest mysteries for the FBI
Who was Cooper?
What happened to him?
Was the money ever recovered by the police?
There are too many questions
Lets try to unravel this mystery
2 things are very interesting about this incident
First during this hijack
no other passenger knew that their plane was hijacked
Neither was anyone k!lled
nor was anyone injured in this hijack
Many people claim this was due to Tina Mucklow
They call her the hero of this hijack
because she was the one to ensure that
Cooper remained calm throughout the flight
his demands were met
and no panic situation could be created
which could cause a ruckus or get someone injured
The copilot of the plane Rataczak later said
She was so calm and cool and collected
I could not think of anyone
that would have been better
to have sitting next to someone  who would do a criminal act like this
The second interesting thing was that
the name DB Cooper
As I told you in the beginning
that guys name was actually Dan Cooper
But today most people
call this the Mystery of DB Cooper
How did Dan become DB?
This is because of a mistake by a news reporter
Back then there was a reporter named James Long
who was late for meeting his deadline
So in a hurry
while talking to his police source
he misheard the name
The police said that
the hijackers name was Dan Cooper
but this reporter heard DB Cooper
and used this name for his news report
This report was picked up by other journalists
while talking about this news  in their newspapers and channels
started using the name DB Cooper
DB Cooper
This is how the name of the hijacker changed
In psychology this phenomenon is known as Anchoring
Anchoring is a cognitive bias that states
humans rely too heavily on the first piece of information
The first piece of news you hear about any breaking news
you have the tendency to believe it
In 2013 a joke theory related to this was published
Brandolinis Law
also called the Bullshit Asymmetry Principle
It states that correcting this anchoring effect can be very difficult
The amount of energy needed to correct bullshit
is of much higher magnitude than to produce it
In broad terms
spreading lies is relatively easier
but having people believe the truth to correct that lie
is much more difficult
But in case of Cooper
it wasnt a huge mistake
Only the name was wrong
Anyway a hijacker shouldnt be expected to use his real name
FBIs initial investigations showed that
when Cooper jumped out of the plane
Cooper had strapped the cash around him
The cash weighed around 10 kilos
Cooper used two parachutes to jump
one strapped in front and one behind
The police had an idea of the area in which Cooper jumped
He jumped in the southwest area of Washington State
There were pine forests lakes and canyons in the area
bears lived there
So in the beginning the investigators said that
there was no chance of Cooper surviving
Jumping from a height of 10000 feet
and in pitch darkness
It was completely dark at 8 in the night
Second the clothes that Cooper was wearing
were not at all suitable for jumping
Jumping in pants and shirt
when it was raining outside
With heavy black clouds in the sky
at the height of 5000 feet
It means that Cooper could not see anything while falling
On top of that the wind speed was important too
It was estimated that when Cooper jumped
he had to be travelling at the speed of 320 km per hour
The United States Parachute Association believed that
there was another problem on top of all this
the cold water
In November the temperature  in this American region is very low
If Cooper had fallen into a lake
it would have been almost impossible to escape from there
In such cold water hypothermia  would have set in within a few minutes
And on top of that the weight strapped on Cooper
would have made it more difficult to swim
But despite all these
some such reasons surfaced later
which force us to think that
perhaps Cooper survived this jump
The reason for this was that after Coopers incident
there were many similar incidents
When Coopers hijacking made news all across the country
more hijackers thought of using the same tactics
At least 5 people did the same copycat hijackings
And all these 5 people
survived after jumping off the plane
One of them was Martin McNally
who hijacked a plane on 24th June 1972
He used the exact same modus operandi
He demanded a sum of 500000
When the plane took off
they used a parachute to jump off like Cooper
In McNallys case the speed of the plane  was around 400500 km per hour
when he jumped
This was twice the speed of Coopers dive
But still McNally survived his jump
using only a reserve parachute
Another similar hijack was done in January 1972
by Richard Lapoint
He wore similar clothes in January
jumped and landed safely in the snow
Its irrelevant that these two hijackers
were later caught by the police
Thats how we know their stories
But the FBI thought that
if these people could jump
in conditions that were worse than when Cooper jumped
and they managed to survive
then it was possible that DB Cooper survived that night
Especially if you consider that
when Tina Mucklow gave the parachutes to Cooper
there were instructions on how to use them
But Cooper told Tina that
she didnt need to read the instructions
He knew how to use them
So now since the FBI started assuming that
Cooper could be alive
their next task was to
search the place where he had jumped
Actually the police had started searching  those jungles the day after the hijack
The police were looking for a body a torn piece of the parachutes
or a 20 bill
At the beginning of the video I told you
that the money given to Cooper was special
The special thing was that
there were 20 bills
10000 notes of 20
200000 in total
And the serial numbers of these notes
were noted down by the bank
The FBI spread the list of serial numbers throughout the country
From banks to casinos
everyone was told to inform the FBI  if they got the notes of those serial numbers
But it was becoming more and more  difficult for the investigators to find Copper
because where could the search area be drawn?
There were many variables
What was the wind speed while the plane was flying?
How dark was it?
What was the exact location of the plane
when Cooper jumped?
After jumping at what height did Cooper deploy his parachutes?
And in which directions could the parachutes have gone?
The investigators best estimate was that
it would have landed somewhere  near Lake Merwin in Washington State
The FBI ran a practical experiment
If we fly the same aircraft with the same configurations
and push out a 91 kg sled through the stairs
based on where the sled landed
we can get a better idea of
the area where Cooper could have landed
Due to this doortodoor searches were conducted in this area
The local farmhouses
the police used to knock on every door
to investigate and to ask people
Petrol boats were running on Lake Mervin and Lake Yale
One company used their submarine for the search
200 ft under the Lake Mervin
they continued to look for him
They wanted to find either the money  a piece of the parachute or a body
but they couldnt find anything
Eventually the investigators
published the serial numbers of the notes in the local newspaper
They ran the news that the first person  to find a note from those serial numbers
would be awarded 1000
This offer remained for 3 years
but not a single note could be found
Now lets skip to 1979
8 years since the hijack
Suddenly a pilot contacted the FBI
His name was Tom Bohan  and he worked for Continental Airlines
The night of the hijack
4 minutes behind Coopers aircraft  and 4000 feet above
another aircraft was flying
which was being flown by Tom
Tom recalled the storm that night
and said that he had never seen  such a storm in his entire career
He said that the FBIs calculations
regarding Coopers drop zone
were off by 80
Since he was on a plane that night
he had a better idea of where Copper landed
He told FBI that
they should be searching near the drainage area of the Washougal River
A few months later Toms suspicion was proven right
An 8yearold boy
found some 20 notes lying on the bank of the Columbia River
All of these were 20 bills
and some of them were still in bundles held together with rubber bands
Hijacker DB Cooper
the first break in the only unsolved  airplane hijacking in United States history
came on a Columbia River beach
An 8yearold boy dug up the shreds of
3000 on Sunday!
As soon as the police checked the serial numbers of these notes
it was immediately confirmed that
this was the same money from years ago
that was given to Cooper
Another search was conducted around this place
but they couldnt find all of the money
In total they could find only 5800
And Toms hypothesis
of Cooper landing in this area
was proved correct
Tom had said that Cooper must have  landed somewhere near the Washougal river
And the money found was downstream of the same river
After this the FBI searched the area in the hope of
finding a body or some pieces of the parachute
But they couldnt find anything
FBI agent Richard Tosaw believed that
Cooper must have drowned in the  cold water of the river that night
An interesting fact here was that
the 8yearold boy who found these notes
was given some portions of these notes as a reward
And in 2008 when the boy grew up
he sold 15 notes in an online auction
And in return for these 20 notes
he got 37000
Because Coopers case was so popular all over the world
people were ready to pay such a high amount for these notes
Another big question that arises is that
regardless of what happened to Cooper  after jumping from the plane
who was Cooper actually?

We must have some background information
about where this guy came from
and what was his identity
The FBI did not have much to help answer this question
There was a tie and tie clip left behind by Cooper
That tie clip was actually golden
and in that tie clip
they found some specific microscopic particles
In March 2009 a research team
started researching these microscopic particles
using new technology
There was a palaeontologist on this team
a scientific illustrator
and a metallurgist
They used electron microscopy to examine these particles
Some portions of the tieclip were of unalloyed titanium
with traces of aluminium and titanium antimony alloy
Their findings suggested that
Cooper worked in a chemical  or metal manufacturing plant
or in an aeronautical engineering company
Maybe he worked in Boeing itself
Because the unalloyed titanium that was used in the tieclip
back then it was used in aircraft fabrication facilities
The Periodical Table of clue say scientists
suggest that Cooper had access to a manufacturing company
that made airplanes
Like the one he jumped from
Perhaps a company with a connection to Boeing
In the first year of the investigation
FBI talked to the passengers and flight crew
to make a sketch of Coopers face
What did Cooper look like?
The first sketch created by 28th November 1971 looked like this
But Air Hostess Schaffer and many witnesses said that
it was not an accurate representation
It took another year to make a new sketch
This wasnt very accurate either
And on 2nd January 1973
the FBI made their third and final sketch of Cooper
After seeing this new sketch
an air hostess said that this photo was accurate
Looking at this drawing it can be easily said that
Cooper looked like this
Dan Coopers real face
and his possible profession
was revealed to the world
Many people started making new theories
about his identity
About who Cooper was
Larry Carr who had led the  investigative team from 20062009
believed that Cooper was an aircraft cargo loader in the Air Force
Because cargo loaders were given basic jump training
How to wear parachutes
how to deploy parachutes
And even on the working of the plane
how to deploy the stairs in the plane
they know all this
Based on these descriptions
the FBI released a list of more than 800 suspects
800 people
any of them could be DB Cooper
But 20 of them were seriously considered
23 of them have interesting stories
One of them was Richard McCoy
an army veteran of the Vietnam War
5 months after the Coopers hijack
he hijacked a plane
in a manner eerily similar to Coopers
A Boeing 727 plane
he demanded 4 parachutes and 500000
The young man wanted 500000
and requested 4 parachutes
After taking the money he deployed the rear stairs
and jumped
But the only difference was that
just two days after the hijack
the FBI found him and arrested him
He was sentenced to 45 years in jail
and the FBI thought that he was Cooper
And that this was his second attempt at hijacking
He was arrested here in his home in Provo Utah
early this morning
When the FBI men came
he did not resist
In 1991 a book was published
DB Cooper The Real McCoy
Written by former FBI agent Russell Caleme
This book states that when McCoys family
was shown the tie and tie clip belonging to Cooper
they believed that those were McCoys
But when McCoy was asked
if he was DB Cooper
he refused to admit or deny it
After spending 2 years in jail
McCoy attempted a jailbreak
which led to a shootout
in which he was killed
After hearing all this you may feel that
the mystery is solved
But there are more twists in our story
Today the FBI does not officially consider McCoy as DB Cooper
There are 2 major reasons behind this
First based on the sketch they made
the description of DB Cooper does not match McCoy
Second the FBI later found evidence
of McCoys whereabouts during the night of Coopers hijacking
He was in Las Vegas
The next day he was at his home with his family
Since there is evidence of this
it is clear that
McCoy cannot be DB Cooper
The second suspect was
a Vietnam War veteran named Robert Rackstraw
He was arrested multiple times for fraud
aircraft theft and possession of explosives
But he was always found not guilty after the arrest
TV producer Thomas Colbert wrote a book in 2016
The Last Master Outlaw
To prove that Rackstraw was DB Cooper
He made a documentary on History Channel
DB Cooper Case Closed
where he said the same thing
Colbert worked with a team of 40 people
including many former FBI agents
All of them believed that Rackstraw was the real DB Cooper
What is the evidence for this?
When FBI began the investigation in the 1970s
Rackstraw was high on the list of initial suspects
In those days Rackstraw used to give joke comments to the media
on the possibility that he was the hijacker
However many years later
he denied these claims
His face matched the sketches
But the FBI let him go after 1979
and removed him from the suspect list
because they couldnt get substantial evidence
TV producer Colbert believed that
the FBI should have kept investigating this guy
With more FBI investigation
they could have uncovered the evidence
While on 11th July 2016
Colbert launched his new book on DB Cooper
the next day on 12th July 2016
the FBI closed the case
In 2016 Rackstraw was 73 years old
and because of the allegations against him in this book
he lost his job
Later in 2019
he passed away due to natural causes
So friends we are back at the same point
Even today this mystery of DB Cooper
is an unsolved mystery
No one knows who was DB Cooper
where did he come from
and where did he go
Now that you know about this mystery what do you think?
That night when DB Cooper jumped off the plane
could Cooper survive that jump or not?
Write in the comments below
It is quite surprising that
after Coopers hijacking
there were many similar hijackings
But in all those hijackings
the hijackers who used parachutes to jump off the plane
first of all he always survived
And second he was always caught by the police or FBI
But what about Cooper?

This is a video made by Artificial Intelligence
All these videos on the screen
all of them are fake

All of this has become possible today
because of Sora AI
A new AI platform called Sora
You cant hide from these changes
No country no economy
Sora AI is an Artificial Intelligence software
developed by OpenAI
The same company which shook the world 15 years ago
when they launched ChatGPT
In ChatGPT you have a texttotext conversation with AI
You write something in text and send it to AI
and the answer is generated in text
After this OpenAI launched the DALLE software
which was texttophoto
You wrote a text prompt
and the type of photo you wanted to generate
and you got an AIgenerated photo
And now this Sora AI is a texttovideo
Now you simply have to write in simple English
about the kind of video you want to generate
And it will do that for you
Like if you say
I want a video of a young person
who is reading a book while sitting on a cloud
Write this prompt
and in response Sora AI will  make a video like this in a few minutes
The videos I have showed you
text prompts were written to generate each of them
Some of them were generated by a long text prompt
while others had a short prompt
But Sora AI can not only generate texttovideo
but also phototovideo
This is a photo of a Shiba Inu dog
If you input this photo into Sora AI
this video is generated
Not only that it is also possible to do videotovideo
Give it the original video here
where a car is driving on the road
And if you tell it to change the environment around it
Like you want it to look like the 1920s
While keeping the car red coloured
So this video is generated from the original video
Do you understand what this technology means?
Entire industries can turn upside down

Why do you need to film for weeks for making movies
when in a few minutes AI can give you footage for the movie?
We will talk about how this will affect the world later in the video
but before that I would like to tell you
about the level of this technology  before the arrival of Sora AI
Exactly one year ago
in March 2023
this video went viral on the internet
Will Smith eating spaghetti
This video was made using AI software of another company
but a year ago this was the peak of this technology
After this some other texttovideo AI tools were released to the public
like Pika Labs and Runway
Before the arrival of Sora AI
Runway was an industry leader in this field
but look at the quality of AIgenerated videos generated by it
There is a vast difference
After Soras release
actor Will Smith was so impressed with this technology
that he made a video of himself
eating spaghetti as a joke
To show the level of technology before
and after the launch of Sora
Sora can now understand
how our world works
how motion works
according to the laws of physics
This is the reason why when the puppies are moving in this video
it knows how the snow on their heads should move
It is now able to understand emotions too
When this cartoon sees this candle burning
you can see the excitement play on its face
Sora is able to understand even the smallest details
like how elephants walk
the exact motion of their feet
this is why these videos look so real to us
You might be wondering about
how Sora is able to do all of it
So its basic functionality
is actually very similar to ChatGPTs
Where on one hand ChatGPT uses tokens
on the other hand Sora uses patches its equivalent
Whatever you ask ChatGPT
it divides the text in tokens
and it generates its answer through tokens
Similarly Sora AI
tries to understand photos and videos
by dividing the visual data into visual patches
And even while creating its output
it uses these visual patches to make the video
I explained this process in detail in my ChatGPT course
about what exactly are tokens
and how they work
If you have taken the course
then refer to the explanation in Chapter 23
the visual patches can be understood as an equivalent of tokens
And if you have not taken the course yet
then do check it out
because this technology is changing the world
It is disrupting industries
If you dont learn about this
if you dont use it in your daily life
you will be left behind
The first two chapters of the course are quite theoretical
in which I explain the concepts behind it
What is the technology behind ChatGPT?
How do tokens work?
What is temperature?
What is the RLHF method?
But the useful things begin in Chapter 3
These are the practical lessons
In Chapter 3 you will learn how to use it in your studies
For example if you want to go study abroad
you dont need to waste money on a consultant
Use ChatGPT
For example you can use it to practice for a job interview
Chapter 4 is focused on personal life
How can you use it in food diet planning  health and fitness and travel planning?
Chapter 5 is my favourite
It is focused on business owners and entrepreneurs
For example you can do market research  and analysis for your business
through ChatGPT
You can use it for Customer Feedback Management
Chapter 6 talks about ChatGPTs limitations
And now there is a Chapter 7 for you
Its a Bonus Content of an hourlong workshop
that I hosted in Dubais 1 Billion Summit
In this workshop I taught the attendees  how to use ChatGPTs full potential
But not only this
in April 2024
I will add another major update to this course
There will be new chapters and new lessons
because this technology is changing so fast
and if you buy this course once
all future updates are free for you

Now if lets get back to Sora
at the first glance you will definitely feel that
this technology has reached perfection
But if you look at it closely
you will see that it is not 100 perfect yet
No doubt this is a great technology
it is absolutely unbeatable
but not yet 100 perfect
Why am I saying this?
Because in the videos I showed you
look at them carefully
The man who is reading the book
look at how the wind is moving  the pages of this book in the wrong direction
The astronaut thats walking
look at how his walking speed increases suddenly
Open AI openly acknowledges the  weaknesses of Sora AI on its website
These AIgenerated videos
sometimes fail to apply the physics of the real world
Like this basketball
which is passing through the hoop
Or the three hands seen in this video
Or this video of a grandma celebrating her birthday
it may seem like everything is fine first
but look at it carefully
How are the people reacting?
Look at it more carefully
Did you find the mistake?
Then look more carefully
The way people are waving their hands in the background
No normal person waves their hand like this
So today these are the minor details
based on which it is possible to detect
if a video is AIgenerated
or a video taken in real life
But the speed with which this technology is improving
I dont think that one year later
it would be possible to detect this anymore
And the people in OpenAI know this
the day these videos become so real that
no human eye will be able to differentiate between these
that day huge problems will be created
Fake news would be spread so easily
Perhaps this is the reason why Sora AI
is not released to the public yet
It is being tested by Red Teamers for security concerns
This means that it is in the testing phase
Red Teamers refers to those people from Cyber Security
who behave like attackers
Their job is to find the systems weaknesses
But even when it would be released to the public
I dont think it would be possible to  manipulate photos and videos of any real person
because that will always be a major security risk
of people using it
to make fake videos of any politician
and that could cause election interference
But this is a thing that is becoming a  big problem even before Sora is released
This is a video of Virat Kohli in which
he is promoting a betting app
is a type of game
which can be called an investmentworthy app
Or I can call it an investmentworthy game
In which you can spend a little money
to get maximum winnings
Could you recognise that this wasnt a real video?
This is a 100 AIgenerated video
Some fraud companies have already started exploiting this
Celebrities faces are used to run these ads on social media
People are lured with money
and told to download their app
The same thing happened to Sachin Tendulkar
My daughter is playing this game now
everyone is talking about it
She plays games on the  app
and earns 180000 every day
Another completely fake video
but did you see that
the technology has reached the level where
it is possible to use someone elses voice
For now there is only one way to avoid such videos
watching these videos carefully
You will always find small mistakes
Somewhere the lip movement will be strange
The quality of such videos will be low
If you try to listen to the voice carefully
you will find that
the voice is not like the original
It seems like an artificially synthesised voice
Listen to Sachin Tendulkars voice again
and everyone is talking about it
You can differentiate by noticing the small details
but most importantly
look at the video content
What is being promoted in the video?
What are you being told to do?
This application is absolutely free
any iPhone owner can download it
The plane flies at 2X 3X 4X 5X etc
If a celebrity tells you to download any app
where you can make 10 times the money you spend on it
this should alert you
Whether it is an AI video or a real video
you should stay away from such things
Apart from this a technological solution  can also be created for these problems
An AI whose job is to
identify AIgenerated videos
OpenAI has said that the videos generated by SoraAI
would have a watermark on them
With that watermark you can always identify whether
a video is AIgenerated or not
Personally I use AIgenerated photos or videos often in my videos
In such cases in the top right corner of the video I always write
You must have seen this written  in the corner of my videos often
This is so that you can understand
that the photo or video on the screen
is not real it is AIgenerated
But an even bigger issue is the jobs
What will be the impact of this AI  on industries and economies globally?
Even in films filmmakers will not have to  carry big cameras and film in different places
In a few years entire films can be made using AI
Last year the director of the Avengers films  Joe Russo famously said that
it will take only 2 years
for AI to reach the level where
it can start producing entire films
Similarly it will have a huge impact on the gaming industry
The video games that took years to make
needed teams of more than 100 people
How easily the same tasks can be done with this
According to this NBC article
filmmaker Tyler Perry was going to spend 800 million
to expand his studio
But as soon as Sora was released
he stopped his studio expansion
After all what is the need for a studio
if AI makes videos for us?
This means that many jobs across different industries
are at risk of being eliminated
The cinematographer who needed many days  to make 2minute long stock footage
and earned money by selling them
or the VFX artist
who made the NPCs for major gaming companies
In the short term the jobs related to film  and video production advertising and marketing
will be affected the most
But at the same time there is a positive side to it
The good thing will be that
we will see democratisation in all these fields
These fields will become more accessible to the common people
If your dream was to become a film producer
but you didnt have the money or the equipment
now you will get the opportunity to show your creativity through Sora AI
without these resources
Now even an IT employee will get the  opportunity to become a good filmmaker
and a musician will get the opportunity to  make music videos without spending a lot
Looking at such technologies
it is understandable to be a little scared of them
Do you know friends that 600 years ago
when the printing press was invented
many religious leaders were opposing it
Some people used to say that
the books are actually given to us by the devil
That books should be banned
In 1501 the Pope  Pope Alexander VI
said that without the permission of the Church
no onw was allowed to print books
One thing is clear here
whether you like this technology or not
it cannot be ignored
All people and all governments
have to learn to adapt to this new world
Many governments around the world  have already started taking proactive steps
Like in Singapores Parliament
recently one of their MPs
gave this speech on Sora AI a few days ago
The politicians name is Tan Wu Meng
He said that the Singapore government
has now launched a new subsidy  to adapt to the new AI developments
This subsidy is for people above 40 years of age
so that they can pursue a fulltime diploma once again
Because their government has understood that
today if you study something in a college or university
whatever you are being taught today
will it still be relevant 20 years later  after technology transforms so drastically?
So it is better to tell people to  educate themselves again after 40 years
To be able to adapt to the new developments
by upskilling themselves
Interestingly the government of Singapore
had started talking about AI in 2019
And in the latest budget for 2024
they have pledged to invest 1 billion in AI
In the National AI Strategy 20
I will invest more than 1 Billion over the next 5 years
into AI computing talent and industry development
So this will be my suggestion to you
The sooner you learn to adapt to this changing world
the more benefits will you reap
But I would like to say one more thing about AI
since AI has become a very trendy word nowadays
many companies are exploiting it
and there are many useless AIs present in the market today
When I made my first video on AI
at the beginning of that video I showed you many things
that could be done through AI
Like changing your face
changing your voice
And if I want
I can also change my voice with the help of AI
But after taking my course  many of you gave me the feedback
asking me why I made a course only on ChatGPT
Why didnt I talk about the other AIs in the course?
This is why
Most of the other AIs are just for vanity
They have no practical use in life
Like during the face swap
when I changed my face to Tom Cruises and Hrithik Roshans
I used a tool called Akool Face Swap
It was an expensive tool
I had spent a lot of money just to get  the output of a few seconds of footage
The result was not that good either
because you could clearly look at me and say that
the face looks manipulated
it doesnt look real
And there were no other features in it
Thats why such AI tools are called Gimmicks
They are used only for showoff
But these wont help you in your studies
nor will it improve your efficiency
and nor will it help you with your business
Thats why I focused the most on ChatGPT
Because ChatGPT is actually lifechanging
ChatGPT can be used practically in many aspects of our lives
Thats why the entire course focuses on it
And recently many Indian AI companies have popped up
claiming to have made the first Indian AI
that is later found to be
using ChatGPT in the base at the back end
Apart from ChatGPT  Midjourney DALLE and Stable Diffusion
are the three texttophoto AI software
that are actually useful
And I think in the near future
Sora AI will be as revolutionary
as ChatGPT was
So if you want me to make a video
giving the overview of all these AI tools
then you can let me know in the comments below
And for now the link to download the course
will be in the description below with the coupon code
you can watch my previous video on AI
It talks about Q AI
In it I explained what is Artificial General Intelligence
Click here to watch it
Farmers are protesting on the streets once again
and this time their biggest demand
is MSP
The legalisation of Minimum Support Price
Minimum Support Price
MSP for all crops
Many news anchors and YouTubers claim that
if the government fulfils this demand
then it will completely destroy the countrys economy
It will cost more than 10 Trillion!
What is the truth behind this?
Is the demand of farmers right or wrong?
Lets understand the reality of the farming industry
in todays video
MRP or Maximum Retail Price
is the maximum price at which  things can be sold in the market
MRP exists to protect consumers  and the general public in the country
So that no company or shopkeeper can exploit us
If there was no MRP
you can imagine how terribly  people would have been exploited
If you were in the desert and facing water shortages
someone could try to sell a bottle of water for 2000
If there was a cooking oil shortage in your city
you could be forced to buy cooking oil for 1000 per litre
Now in contrast to MRP the opposite is MSP
that is Minimum Support Price
The minimum amount that would be  paid to the farmers for their crops
The reason remains the same
So that companies and middlemen cant exploit them
Even if the buyers set up a mafia
the farmer shouldnt be forced to sell  onions for 2 and garlic for 050
They should have a guarantee of a minimum price
Like MRP MSP is also very logical
thats why most politicians have always favoured it
Like BJP leader Narendra Modi before 2014
Listen to what he said
is a headache for every farmer
But for the government
it has become a great way  to force their will
In one state the minimum support  price for wheat will be something
in the next state it will be another
In one place the rate of rice will be something
in another place it will be something else
But everywhere the buyer is the Indian government
But the farmers dont get the right price
The policy of deciding the price  has not been implemented
How well Narendra Modi explained this problem!
A big round of applause for him
And not only the problem
he gives us the solution too
Listen further
Brothers and sisters
we have stated in our manifesto
that we will decide the MSP  based on rules and regulations
That is why we have said that  the cost of input for the farmer
water labour electricity  seeds fertilisers medicines
whatever the cost is
50 profit will be added to that cost
And that will be the MSP theyll have to sell at
In India MSP is issued by CACP
the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices
It is a decentralised agency
which was established in 1965
And today it functions under the Ministry  of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare
But the question is how should the MSP be decided?
How much should the MSP be?
In 2002 a committee was formed
the High Level Committee on Long Term Grain Policy
headed by economist Abhijit Sen
This committee said that MSP should be
based on C2 cost of production
But what does this mean?
To understand C2 we need to  understand A2 and FL costs first
First comes A2 cost
This is the cost that farmers have to pay
as direct expenses
Farmers buy seeds fertilisers pesticides  hire labourers to work in their fields fuel cost
these are the A2 costs
After this comes the FL cost
FLs full form is Family Labour
This cost is an estimated value
of unpaid family labour
When a farmer works in his field
often his family members help him in farming
Because his family members invest their time to help him
there should be a labour cost for them too
They could have used this time to do some other job
They missed the opportunity of getting a job
This is known as Opportunity Cost in economics
So these were the A2 and FL costs
Today CACP takes A2  FL cost to decide MSP
and multiplies it by 15
This is how MSP is decided today
But Abhijit Sens committee said that
we need to consider the C2 cost
C2 refers to the Comprehensive Cost
In C2 cost not only do we take the A2 and FL costs
but we consider the cost of Owned Capital  and the Rental Value of Land
You can understand this better with an example
Think of a photographer who has his own studio
To carry on his business
not only does he have to  spend money to take photos
and to print photos
but also to buy a camera
and even to pay rent the rent for the studio
Like a photographers studio
a farmers land has a rental value
If the farmer owns the land
then it is his capital
And if he doesnt own it
then he pays rent on it
Apart from this like the photographers  camera and studio lights
a farmer has to buy a tractor and a cultivator
The farmer doesnt buy a tractor just for fun
A tractor is bought to be used for agriculture
So shouldnt that cost be taken into account too?
All these are called Owned Capital Assets
And Abhijeet Sens commission report stated that
in C2 cost we should include  the A2 cost FL cost and this extra cost
And then make it the new basis for MSP
Friends after this a Swaminathan report was released
In 2004 MS Swaminathan
was heading the National Commission on Farmers
You might have heard of him already
he was one of the architects of the Green Revolution
Between 2004 and 2006
the Swaminathan Commission released 5 reports
In total these reports spanned almost 2000 pages
On the 246th page of the 5th report it is written that
the MSP should be at least 50 more than  the Weighted Average Cost of Production
Now some people get confused that
whether the Swaminathan Commission  was talking about C2 cost or A2FL cost
But if we read the entire report
there is no confusion
Between pages 74 to 84
theres a detailed discussion on
how in most of the states
MSP does not even recover the C2 cost
And if this C2 cost is not recovered
then farmers will stop farming  those crops in the long term
This 278page report
is available on the Ministry of Agricultures website
If you want to read it  the link is in the description below
Economics Professor R Ramakumar says that
when MS Swaminathan presented this  report to the Union Agriculture Minister
the 22nd slide of that presentation clearly mentioned that
MSP would be calculated at  C2 cost plus 50
On 28th September 2017  MS Swaminathan tweeted that
MSP should be at least C2  50
with procurement storage  and distribution costs included
He went one step further
He started talking about postharvest costs too
When farmers store their crops
they will incur storage costs too
we should take those into account
This was mentioned not only in this tweet
but also in the second report of  the Swaminathan Commission
On page 412 it was written that
The CACP should look into the aspects of risk factor
marketing and postharvest expenses
It might feel that he wants to pay  a lot of money to the farmers
That our countrys economy will crash
if we start paying farmers so much
Doesnt every other business in the country
run like this?
All the costs incurred in running any business
are taken into account
Most companies account for their
office vehicles travel
TV trolley bags blazers
networking tea snacks pizza
everything as Company Expenses
So for farmers to take these four costs into account
whats wrong with that?
The input cost of seed fertilisers and water
the cost of their family labour
the cost of their capital assets
and finally the marketing and postharvest expenses
Swaminathan report mentioned two more interesting things
First MSP should not only be applied to the government
but also to private traders
Whoever is buying directly from the farmers
should buy at least at the MSP
And second MSP should be considered only as a bottom line
So that no one can buy produce cheaper than it
But when the government buys
they should buy it at the same price
as the private traders
If the market price increases
then the government should pay more
This report even said that
the income of the farmers
should be comparable to that of the civil servants
Imagine that
But anyhow theres no point in talking about it now
We will consider only the C2  50 cost
Now the question is
who will support the farmers to  get them the right price for their produce?
I want to free the farmers from  governments unfair practices
Narendra Modi!
Not only did he talk about farmers and MSP
he took an oath!
To improve Indias economic standing
we need to first improve the farmers economic standing
And to that extent
we the BJP are here to ask for your blessings
Such a talent for putting his point across
Explained the problem in the first 2 minutes
and then gave a solution
And what he says next
will bring tears to your eyes
Lal Bahadur Shastri used to say
Jai Jawan Jai Kisan
He said the number of soldiers who died on the battlefield
more than that farmers have committed su!cide
They had to d!e a helpless deth
And thats why he addresses the crowd
if India has to change
then Indias villages have to change first
If India has to change
To be honest friends  I dont have anything left to say
Narendra Modi talked about this in such a great way
But what happened after this video?
The people gave their blessings
In 2014 Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister
Two years later he made another big promise
By 2022 when India celebrates its 75th Independence Day
farmers income will be double
Now some people will say that
Modi could not do this because of COVID
Even though he did his best
But even if we ignore the two years of COVID
If not 2022 then it should have doubled by 2024
Instead of doubling the farmers income
instead of giving them the MSP at C2  50
what did the Modi government do?
They passed 3 black laws
The 3 Farm Laws
I had made videos on this before
when these laws were passed
In one video I showed you how
unconstitutionally they passed the bills in the Parliament
But the second problem was
these bills were actually favouring  the corporates over the farmers
Its not that before the laws were introduced
the farmers couldnt enter into  contract farming with the corporates
Obviously they could
But the provisions in those 3 Farm Laws
was basically like telling the corporates
that they could buy sell and set up markets arbitrarily
Government markets would be taxed
but there would be no taxes on private markets
What was an unfair practice before
corporates could now begin hoarding
raise the prices artificially
no reins on corporate actions
Almost in every aspect
large corporate companies were  given an advantage over the farmers
Last year in August a report was  published in the Reporters Collective
which revealed some interesting  facts about these farm laws
It was revealed that a man named Sharad Marathe
had written a letter to the then Vice  Chairperson of Niti Aayog Rajiv Kumar
They knew each other before
This letter talked about
the need to introduce marketdriven  agriculture business model in India
Look at Niti Aayogs office  memorandum from 16th October 2017
It talks about Sharad Marathes concept note
It was suggested that Niti Aayog  set up a task force for this
And guess what?
A task force was set up
Who was on that task force?
Sharad Marathe himself
Apart from this corporations like
Adani Group Patanjali Big Basket
Mahindra Group and ITC
but there were no farmers on this task force
In fact forget about any farmer
no farmer organisations or  economists were on this task force
The next report tells us how
Adani Groups companies wanted
the Essential Commodities Act to be repealed
Because this Act prohibited companies from hoarding
Why did Adani Group want to have this act repealed?
Perhaps this is connect to an old event
Pulse Scam from 2015
In April this year
the price of Arhar Dal pigeon pea  starts spiking all of a sudden
The dal which was available  in the market for less than 70
started costing more than 200
In 2015 the pulses reached 200 per Kg
The government carried out raids
6077 raids in total
More than 70000 tonnes of pulses were seized
which were being illegally hoarded
Who was benefiting from this?
Look at this report in Business Today
The Competition Commission of India raided
the offices of Glencore Export Trading Group and Edelweiss Group
When an income tax probe was conducted it was found that
Glencore Edelweiss and ETG were the major players
in this Pulse Price Rigging case
And finally look at this EPW report
Glencore had investments in
the ETC groups ETC Agro Processing India Private Limited
And Adani Group was connected to Glencore
through a joint venture
ChemOil Adani Private Limited
So its quite simple friends
When lentils were being sold for 200 per kg
the common man was suffering
The farmers were not benefiting
but some corporate companies  in the middle were benefiting
And what should the government  have done in such a case?
Should the antihoarding laws have been made stricter?
Or should it have been relaxed
to make it easier for companies to hoard?
Obviously they should have made it stricter
Instead the government introduced  these three farm laws
Some people tried to justify the farm laws by saying that
the Swaminathan report mentioned the  need to liberalise the agriculture sector
To bring in some market reforms
This is true
If you read the Swaminathan report
it is written on page 31 of the 5th report
that the role of State APMCs needs to be reviewed
We need to move towards a single Indian market
Even while bringing farm laws the government had said
One Nation One Market
But the problem lies in the details
Well the marketing terms
can be contorted in any manner
The devil is in the details
But the MSP mentioned in the Swaminathan report
the C2  50 formula
they were not included in the farm laws
Friends do you know the status  of MSP implementation today?
According to the Shanta Kumar Committee  appointed by the Central Government
only 6 of farmers get the benefit of MSP
Some other reports state that
6 is an underestimate
but lets believe Shanta Kumar
who is a BJP politician
and a former Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh
In 2020 he told The Print that
only the elite 6 of farmers get the benefit of MSP
and they are the ones opposing the farm laws
This is true to some extent
Most of the farmers who are protesting today
are from Haryana Punjab  and some are from Western UP
Why is this?
Farmers can be grouped into two
Something is being snatched away from one of the groups
The one that benefits from MSP now  but will soon lose the benefit
Will they protest?
Or the other group of farmers  who never benefited from MSP?
Take the example of Bihar
In 2006 Bihar abolished the APMC Act
What did the farmers of Bihar get from this?
This report tells us that between  200708 and 201617
in these 10 years
there was not a single season where
Bihars farmers could sell at a price higher than the MSP
The report of 2018 shows that farmers in Bihar
had to sell wheat at a price lower than MSP
A 2020 study shows that Punjabs farmers
get a 30 higher crop price
in comparison to Bihars farmers
only because of MSP
So the rest of the farmers who are not protesting
are in even worse situations
Ideally the remaining 94 of the farmers
should also be brought under provision of MSP
But what did the government try to do?
It tried to take away MSP from the few who were getting it
Thats why 3 years ago
the farmers protest was on a large scale
The protests went on for a year
Around 600700 people lost their lives in those protests
and after that those farm laws were thankfully repealed
But what about now?
Since the protests began again
it was for the original demand
for the promise made by Narendra Modi in 2014
MSPs legal guarantee
for farmers to get a fair price
If Narendra Modi demands MSP its alright
But if farmers demand it it somehow becomes wrong
There is a limit to hypocrisy
Look at this article from 20th February
The government has banned more  than 177 social media accounts
just because they were talking about farmers right
When these accounts were banned
Twitter came out with a public reply
That they banned the accounts  on the orders of the government
even though they acknowledged that  the governments actions were wrong
since it goes against freedom of expression
Kisan Ekta Morcha had 500000 followers
Its been banned for the last 2 years
It was banned during the last farmers protest
On Twitter many journalists and users say that
whenever they tweeted in favour of farmers
the government banned their accounts
And when in my videos I talk about
our country moving towards dictatorship
some people come at me to say that  the country is still a democracy
Tell me in which democracy have you heard of
people speaking in favour of farmers on social media
having their social media accounts banned on a mass scale?
I have not seen this happening in any democracy
But here I would like to give you a solution
To bypass the bans on these accounts
This can be done by using a VPN
You can download any VPN app on your phone
and with it you can spoof your location
Because the government can ban accounts only within India
not outside India
You can change the location of your phone through VPN
You can set the location to any place outside India
USA Canada Australia Europe anywhere
And you will be able to see the  blocked accounts even if you are in India
In my opinion NordVPN is one of the best VPN apps
It has more than 6000 servers
in 67 countries
The best advantage of this is that
no matter which country you go to
you can bypass any local restrictions in that country
The Chinese government does this a lot
In China apps like Facebook and YouTube are banned
But they can access these by using NordVPN
On top of it it also protects your online privacy
because it hides your IP address
And their latest feature is that
they provide a virtual server even in India
So people living outside India
can now spoof their location  pretending to be in India
Since NordVPN has sponsored this video
you will get a huge discount
plus 4 additional months for free
if you use my link
You can find the link in the description below
Its riskfree
Because of NordVPNs 30day moneyback guarantee
So you can try it by going to  NordVPNcomDhruv
Today in North India
what is the economic viability of farming
lets understand it with a reallife example
In my family among my relatives  many are still engaged in farming
So the example I will show
is prepared with the information given by my uncle
I talked to him in detail and understood
the exact expenses on everything
and the profit he gets
You can see this Excel file with calculations on screen
This shows the economic viability  of millet farming in Haryana
The second chart you are seeing
basically divides everything into two parts
On the left side if you farm like a business
you rent land and hire people to work in your fields
in such cases the biggest expense you will bear
is of manpower at 57
Tractor rent is 7 and land rent is 31
In this case you will incur a loss  of around 20000 per acre
So this business model is a failure
The second case is when
you own the land
and you are farming it yourself
then the biggest expense is water and seeds
In such cases you can earn a profit of around 34000 per acre
This is for a year
But if a farmer has to manage  his familys expenses respectively
then 34000 in a year is absolutely nothing
Here he should make at least 2 lakh in annual profits
So even in the second case
for this business model to work
a farmer should own at least 3 acres of land
Looking at this you should get an idea of
how difficult farming is today
This calculation was for millets
But this profit margin increases for rice crops
In this case as you can see on the screen
the profit per acre is 48000 per year
if the farmer owns the land
And if it is done as a business by taking the land on lease
it is possible to make some profit
Approximately 3000 per acre per year in profits
Two things are clearly evident with this
First farmers who own less than 3 acres of land
find it extremely difficult to survive
This is why in many states
farmers have given up farming
and now work as labourers or are unemployed
Only the farmers who own a lot of land
are able to earn a good profit
Second this shows the importance of MSP
Looking at the market price if grains like  millet are not profitable for the farmers
then farmers will not grow millet
Only those grains will be preferred
that can bring them higher profits
leading to environmental damage
More water will have to be used
and our health will suffer too
Because grains like millet
are actually better for health
compared to rice and wheat
It is equally important to mention that
according to the Swaminathan report
MSP was not the only safety net for farmers
That report also mentioned that
to empower farmers
we need to build more than 50000  farm schools all over the country
Farmers should be taught new ways of innovation
Knowledge should lead their empowerment
The second report of the Swaminathan Committe stated that
villages should have food grain banks to prepare for natural calamities
We saw the COVID19 pandemic
and how there were some people who starved to deth
MS Swaminathan was a visionary man
He knew that any natural calamity could happen at any time
and food grain banks are essential to protect ourselves from it
In his report he appreciated Odishas culture
In Odisha it is cultural
to see seed banks in villages
It is actually the Ministry of Agricultures job
to help in the establishment of rural  godowns warehouses and coal storage
And then the use of this infrastructure  should be subsidised for hill farmers
But oh no!
If this happens how will PM Modis friend  Gautam Adani run his business?
In a previous video I talked about how
in 2021 there was an incident
where Gautam Adanis company paid only 12 per kg of apples
It was lower than the cost of production
The maximum that their company paid
was 72 per kilo
for premium 100 colour apples
And these apples were later sold for 250 per kilo in the market
A farmer Dimple Panjta told The Wire how
Adani had bought Agrade apples  for 65 per kilo in 2011
Ten years later they paid only 7 per kilo more to buy those apples
Why is this so?
Because according to the Swaminathan report
the sufficient cold storage facilities that  were supposed to be built for the farmers
were never built
If the farmers do not have the right conditions for storage
they will either have to sell their produce
or else the apples would rot
Many farmers across the country  are blackmailed like this
Dimple Panjta also said that
his NGO found out how Adani
was sold the land at dirt cheap prices
in many places in the Shimla district
to build three cold storage centres
Now can you understand the struggles  faced by the farmers in our country?
Today the government has awarded M S Swaminathan with a Bharat Ratna
But if a farmer talks about implementing the Swaminathan report
then their voice is suppressed
They are attacked with tear gas
And what does the media do in all this?
The media tries to defame the farmers
These TV news anchors
spread propaganda against the farmers
Fake news about them being Khalistanis
and traitors are run
Sometimes they claim that the farmers  demand will be the end of the Indian economy
I will talk about this in a moment
but think about it
When the farmers are not actively protesting
how many times does the media talk about the farmers?
When the farmers commit su!cide every day
when they are forced to sell onions for 2 per kilo
how many debates are organised by these news channels?
YouTuber Ramit Verma analysed 202 debates  on four Hindi news channels
Aaj Tak News18 Zee News and India TV
out of these 202 primetime debates
how many debates were on farmers
and the unemployed youth?
Absolutely zero
Agriculture expert P Sainath says that
69 of our countrys population still lives in villages
But what is the share of news from rural India
on the front page of newspapers?
Only 067
During the last farmers protest
5072 news stories were published in 5 months
Out of those only 07 news stories were about
the increasing cost of production
Only 27 even mentioned the demand for MSP
So when farmers are dying or going through rough times
the media remains silent
But as soon as they raise their voice
to get an MSP
a minimum price for them to barely live on
these TV channels begin their propaganda
One YouTuber said that
if the government gave in to the  farmers demands and implemented MSP
then it will cost us 10 Trillion!
Another said it would be 18 trillion
They lie so much that
the news article they use while lying
catches them in their lie in the same second
Rs 10 lakh crore 10 Trillion is misinformation
First the MSP that is being given now
and the new MSP that is demanded
only the difference between the two should be considered
to calculate the extra money spent by the government
According to a CRISIL study
which examined 16 out of 23 crops with an MSP
they estimate that the real cost of legalising MSP
will be only around 210 billion
for the marketing year 2023
Second agriculture expert Devinder Sharma states that
the government doesnt buy everything from the farmers
The government buys produce on MSP only when
the market prices crash
The main burden of buying at MSP
will be on the private players
According to the Swaminathan report
MSP should be applied to private companies as well
So if someone has to bear the expenses
it is the middlemen corporate companies  who are already earning millions
And what is the issue with them paying  a minimum support price to the farmers
when similar laws already exist in other industries?
When a company hires an employee
does the minimum wage law apply or not?
Similarly when a company buys produce from a farmer
a minimum support price law can be applicable
Now someone might say that
this goes against the principles of the free market
How can a government impose such regulations?
We should have a free market
But I would like to ask you
when Adani buys apples for 12 per kg from the farmers
is this a free market?
When rules are changed
and 6 airports are given to Adani on a serving tray
The white revolution in India
didnt happen because of the free market
It happened due to the Governments protectionism
It happened because of the milk cooperatives
I talked about this in the video on Amul
People hear the phrase free market
and start using it
Before using such heavy words
people should understand the philosophy of Adam Smith
David Ricardo Labour theory Karl Marx
John Maynard Keynes
Only after understanding these
should one make an opinion about  what free market is and what it is not
You dont have to understand all these complexities
Just watch this video
I bought this for 25
theres 100 grams of corn
How much did the farmers make?
If they sell 100g of corn for 25
they should have been insanely rich
But no
that doesnt happen
The reality is different
This is such a simple concept
shared by Facebook user Priyanka Singh
She calls herself a farmers daughter
She bought a 100g packet of sweet corn
It was priced at Rs 25
This means that 1 kg of sweet corn costs 250
Now how much does a farmer get out of this 250?
We discussed MSP in this video
If MSP is applied
the farmer will get 21 per kg
Out of 250 we are talking about only 21 per kg
Even after implementing MSP  the farmer will get only this amount
That is the middleman
will still keep about 230 out of it
Is it wrong for the farmer to get  even this minimum price?
Its your turn share your opinion in the comment below
If you liked this video then watch this video too
in which I have explained how the government
is manipulating the laws for other industries
just to benefit their crony capitalist friends
It might be shocking for you
Hello friends
If you remember in 2017
the video of Paytms CEO and founder  Vijay Shekhar Sharma went viral
You could see the excitement
as he was celebrating Paytms success
He famously said
Those who are not with us will cry
But sadly 7 years later
the situation has completely changed
Those who are with Paytm are crying
Over the last few days we saw  a horrific crash of this company
On 30th January the stock price of this company was at 760
Today it has fallen below 380
What is the reason behind this?
Lets understand the rise and downfall of Paytm
in this video
Paytm began its journey in 2010
But initially it was just a mobile recharging platform
An app through which you could
recharge your phone and pay landline bills
The company gradually added more features to its app
It was only in January 2014 that
Paytm Wallet was launched
With this you could pay online using Paytm
By 2015 it was possible to pay for metro  recharges electricity gas and water bills
But the real jump in the companys popularity
was seen only after 8th November 2016
That day when demonetisation happened
500 and 1000 currency notes
will no longer be legal tender  from midnight tonight
The very next day after demonetisation
the frontpage ads in many newspapers  across the country looked like this
Paytm congratulates Honourable  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi
on taking the boldest decision
in the financial history of independent India
Now no ATMs use Paytm
The first controversy about Paytm was raised here
People questioned whether
Paytm has any link with the government
Using the Prime Ministers face in this way
while advertising their platform
And the decision of demonetisation  which was said to be secretive
was declared on 8th November at 8pm
So how did it happen that the very next day
in the morning newspaper on 9th November
this was the front page ad?
Did this company already know that  demonetisation was going to happen?
Whatever happened one thing was clear
Paytm benefited a lot from this decision
According to Euro Moneys report before demonetisation
Paytm had 125 million customers
But only after 3 months of the demonetisation
Paytms had approx 185 million customers
The CEO of this company Vijay Shekhar Sharma
did not miss the opportunity to capitalise on this opportunity
Paytm hired more than 10000 agents
to distribute their QR codes  to local shops and vendors
Shopkeepers were encouraged in every city
to use Paytm
The company was growing tremendously
But around this time
there were 23 other controversies
One was Paytms Chinese link
In 2015 a Chinese company named Alibaba
invested 680 million in Paytm
and 40 stake in Paytm company
went to this Chinese company
Alibabas founder is Jack Ma
and Vijay had said that he was his hero
He had given a statement to the Financial Times newspaper
I became totally interested in China
Alibaba and Jack  all three things
You must be aware of the recent  relations between India and China
China is repeatedly intruding on the Indian border
In 2017 the Doklam border standoff took place
Many people had criticised Paytm for this
Claiming that the company pretends to be a patriot
when they want to sell something
But they have been taking Chinese funding secretly
Because of this criticism
the Chinese stake in the company was reduced
in 2023 Vijay transferred about 10 stake back to himself
and the Chinese stake in the company  is around 135 as of now
In May 2018 the next controversy arose regarding Paytm
when the investigative news agency CobraPost
conducted an undercover operation
Their undercover reporter
went to meet the Vice President of Paytm  Ajay Shekhar Sharma
Vijay Shekhar Sharmas brother
When he was asked
if he would spread the propaganda  of a political party through the app
he happily accepted
There will be videos of Guruji too
there are other things as well  I give those to you later
Well take care of all of that
if RSS tells us to
Because loyalty to RSS runs in our blood
He went on to say that
when the government asked them  for the data of some Paytm users in JK
during the stone peltings
they happily gave the data to the government
When our operations were shut down in JK
due to the stones The stone peltings yes
the PMO called us personally
asking us to hand over data to them
of the Paytm users
I made a video on this 6 years ago
if you remember  if you are a veteran viewer of my channel
But nothing significant happened with these controversies
The company kept growing very fast
Generally speaking
there are many companies who
dont care about your data
They sell your data to other companies
Especially online it happens a lot
Your data is used to create a digital profile
so that you can be shown online targeted ads
A good way to avoid this is to use VPN
A VPN encrypts your internet traffic
In my opinion one of the best VPN apps
is NordVPN
which is also the sponsor of this video
One of the advantages of using NordVPN is that
you can use it for content streaming
If a specific show movie or video  is banned in your location
you can bypass these restrictions
by setting your location somewhere else through VPN
Recently due to increasing customer demand
NordVPN has added a server in India
This is a virtual location server with Indian IP
And when you browse the internet with a VPN
your data is secure
You cant be tracked online by other companies

In 2017 Paytm launched Paytm Payments Bank
They started offering banking services
Payments Bank is like a bank to some extent
You can create a bank account
deposit money and get a debit card
But compared to a normal commercial bank
there are some important differences
Payments banks focus mostly on digital services
There are very few  physical branches of payments banks
And according to RBIs Rules
payments banks cannot offer  credit card and loan services
Normal commercial banks  like HDFC SBI ICICI
do not have any deposit limit
You can deposit as much as you want in those banks
But RBI has prescribed a limit for payments banks
You cannot deposit more than 200000 in these banks
I am telling you all this in detail because
the current state of Paytm
is largely caused by Paytms Payments Bank
RBI the Reserve Bank of India
is the central bank of the country
It decides the monetary policy of the country
and also works to print money
All the banks and financial institutions in the country
have to follow the rules and  guidelines prescribed by the RBI
So on 31st January 2024
the Paytm crash
happened because the RBI
imposed operational restrictions  on Paytms Payments Bank
RBI said that Paytms Payments Bank
kept violating our rules repeatedly
There was persistent noncompliance by them
And thats why RBI put restrictions on the bank
After 29th February 2024
Paytms Payments Bank cant accept any new deposits
There cant be money topups in customer accounts
New customers cant be onboarded
And RBI said that all the nodal accounts
with this Paytm Payments Bank
should be closed by 15th March 2024
Nodal accounts are those accounts
which are used by ecommerce and online services businesses
And as far as Paytm Wallet is concerned
you can use your existing balance
but after 29th February
you cant deposit any more money in it
So obviously this is a major decision by the RBI
And such decisions are not taken in a jiffy
Its not like RBI randomly decided one day
to take action on Paytm
and implemented these decisions
In fact there is a very long history behind this
The truth is that Paytm was time and again
warned by the RBI for years
but it still didnt rectify its actions
In November 2017
Paytms Payments Bank was launched
and in June 2018
RBI issued the first warning
An audit found that Paytm
was not following the antimoney  laundering regulations properly
And the identity of the customers  who made their accounts with their bank
was not being verified properly by Paytm
The KYC or Know Your Customer compliance
wasnt adhered to by Paytm
So RBI told Paytm to stop onboarding new customers
until it fixes all these issues
Paytm took some action regarding this warning
because in January 2019
RBI allowed Paytm to resume onboarding customers
The restrictions were removed
But after 25 years in October 2021
came the next big shock
A fine of 10 million was imposed on Paytm
Because while filling in their licence application
they submitted incorrect information and documents
The issues that RBI had flagged before
customers not being verified properly
regulations are not being followed properly
the same issues were seen again
Once again customer onboarding had to be stopped
In October 2023 another huge fine was imposed on Paytm
this time it amounted to 50 million
RBI hoped that after 2 warnings and 2 fines
Paytm would meet the regulatory requirements
and start verifying its customers properly
But even after all this
Paytm did not take these seriously
And for this reason on 31st January 2024
RBI had to take concrete steps
Since Paytm could not follow  the rules and regulations properly
RBI had to stop its operations
RBIs findings were very shocking
According to CNBC
Paytm allowed hundreds of thousands of  customers to open bank accounts with them
without proper KYC documentation
There were thousands of cases where
thousands of customers  had opened multiple accounts
using the same PAN card
In some accounts transactions were worth
millions of rupees
Here the risk of potential money laundering was evident
It is possible that money laundering  was taking place through Paytm
Outlook reported that according to an analyst
Paytm had around 350 million wallets
Of which around 310 million wallets are inactive
no one is using these
And in the remaining 40 million wallets
most of them have no balance or very little balance
Because of this they can be used like mule accounts
A Mule account is an account
that is used for illegal activities
like money laundering
After this there are concerns about data privacy too
RBI said that Paytms parent company
One97 Communications Ltd
there is no operational segregation  between it and Paytm Payments Bank
There was cash flow between the two
which was not disclosed in the financial statements
So many rules and regulations were ignored
Is the arrogance of their CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma  responsible for this to some extent?
He gave many interviews to media channels
this arrogance was seen in his words in those interviews
If you fundamentally believe  that Paytm is 3 payment player
that is where the beginning of the problem is
in understanding
Im surprised that people dont know this
in this country but
we make profit so it is
Somebody who has not met us
and has an opinion on us
is not my opinion
to keep an opinion on that
After RBIs announcement on 31st January
a commotion broke out
People started taking out  the money they had invested in Paytm
So Paytms stock crashed very fast
To calm people down
Paytm posted on its social media handles that
there was nothing wrong
On 2nd February Vijay Shekhar Sharma tweeted this
To every Paytmer
Your favourite app is working
will keep working beyond 29th February as usual
For every challenge there is a solution
and we are sincerely committed to serve our nation
in full compliance
India will keep winning global accolades
in payment innovation and  inclusion in financial services
As you can see once again
patriotism was used as a shield here
Dont see us as a company
see us as patriots serving the nation
Using India as the shield
Paytm tried to hide behind it
This reminds me of a quote
Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel
You must have heard this quote
In my opinion we should be wary of such companies
which rely too heavily on nationalism
A few years ago there was a phone Freedom 251
They printed Indias national flag on the back of the phone
It was sold as the worlds cheapest phone
but it turned out to be a big scam
If a companys products and services
have intrinsic value
they sell it by promoting those values
But if they dont have much to say  about their products or services
then patriotism is used as a selling point
Urging you to buy their product
just because they are Indian
Because they are an Indian company
they use it as the only reason  why you should buy their product
Anyways if we come back to Paytm
the question is what will happen next?
Internally the employees of the company
are facing a lot of uncertainty
They are not getting much clarity from the leadership
about what will happen next
Economic Times reported that
an executive of the company told them that
their business model might change
Now instead of being a bank
they might try to become a thirdparty payments app
So they will have to change  some things on the back end
And they will have to make the change in a limited time
If you look at Paytms annual report
to check how much has it earned each year
you will see that it has always been
a lossmaking company since
its shares were listed on the stock market
Look at this chart
in FY 2021 the company incurred a loss of 16 billion
In FY 2022 a loss of 15 billion
In FY 2023 a loss of 17 billion
The good news was that year after year
the companys losses were decreasing
So it could have been expected that next year
that is this year in FY 2024
the company would earn its first profit
But now after everything that has happened
it seems difficult
The company expects that this year
the companys loss could increase by 3 billion to 5 billion
Paytm has revealed this to the public
saying that they will now comply  with the guidelines issued by RBI
But after this announcement
the companys stock price fell further
What is the path to profitability Vijay?
What is by when will Paytm make money?
Make more money?  By making more money
By making more money!
Vijay Shekhar Sharma will have to come up  with better answers to these questions
if he wants to convince people
Actually convincing people
will be the biggest challenge for Paytm
An average person is very picky about choosing a company
And publics trust plays an important role here
Once people choose their toothpaste
they decide that they will use  that companys toothpaste forever
They dont change their mind easily
Here they will be more cautious as this  involves their money and banking abilities
Bringing customers back
wont be easy for Paytm
But convincing customers will come later
First Paytm will have to convince RBI
That wont be an easy task
But there is light at the end of the tunnel
a way to get out of this can be
to have another company
buy Paytms wallet business
A Business Standard report suggests that
HDFC Bank and Jio Financial Services
might just do this
But Jio has denied this speculation
saying that they have no intention of doing so
And anyway before executing such a sale
theyd need RBIs approval
I have done similar case studies on other companies
like this one on Amul
What is the secret behind  the success of companies like Amul?
You can click here to find out
A child deprived of his fathers love
either due to his fathers absence
or excessively strict upbringing
It leads to the child developing psychological issues
evolving into severe problems  as the child reaches adulthood
This isnt a fictional narrative
numerous research papers have proved these claims
Studies consistently indicate
that a fathers absence  diminishes a childs selfconfidence
Other studies show that harsh parenting
excessive strictness while growing up
is linked to the development  of aggressive behaviour in children
Youd think that harsh parenting is very common
how can it be so bad?
Id say look around you
Low selfconfidence and  aggression are common traits in people
not only this several research papers show that
the absence of a caring father
can be a contributing factor  in someone becoming a criminal
Imagine if someone were to  make a film on such a sensitive topic
well you dont need to imagine it
a cinematic masterpiece already exists
no Im not talking about the one youre thinking
I meant The White Ribbon
The White Ribbon film was  honoured with the Best Film Award
at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival
as well as the International Critics Prize
Best Film at the European Film Awards
over 10 German Film Awards
and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film
India too boasts remarkable films on this sensitive topic
such as Govind Nihalanis Ardh Satya
I dont care about what you want
Am I your wife?
I live how I want to live
I do not bow down to someone elses whims
You better not forget that
Similarly Vikramaditya Motwanes Udaan
If he wants to live in my house
eat and wear what I earn
he has to live like I want him to
But I dont want to work in the factory
Did anyone ask your opinion?
There are some beautifully  written famous songs on this issue
such as this
The lyrics emphasise that
though people know how to have children
but they struggle with becoming a father
Now consider the scenario this sensitive concept
is picked up by an insensitive director
with a track record of regressive and  misogynistic films such as Kabir Singh
what will happen then?
Unfortunately we dont need to merely speculate
be it would result in this film Animal
While Bollywood has produced  its fair share of subpar films
this particular one stands out
To me this seems like a cringefest
which will prove to be cncerous for our society
Some may instantly dismiss this critique
as an exaggeration
arguing that its just a film
and theres no need to be overly woke
Additionally comparisons are  drawn to other violent films
like Gangs of Wasseypur  Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction
that are not criticised as much
And that watching violence in films  doesnt drive one to violent behaviour
The director of a film brings their individual morality
and subjective opinions into the narrative
Labelling a film as a cringefest cncer may seem too harsh
I merely ask you to hear me out
I promise to delve into a detailed explanation in this video
Not only about the problematic elements in the film
but also the broader societal issues
touching on topics such as alpha males and feminism
Friends I am sure you remember  the Nirbhaya case from 2012
That had shocked the entire nation
During that time Madhumita Pandey  a Clinical Psychology Masters student
embarked on a quest
to understand the motivations behind such heinous acts
To look for the answers to this
she decided to talk to the individuals who committed such acts
She wanted to survey the prisoners of Tihar jail
Eventually she interviewed 122 convicted rpists
and 65 convicted mrd3rers in Tihar jail
A stark difference emerged in their responses
most mrd3rers expressed some  level of regret for their actions
they regretted destroying multiple lives
Some regretted their actions more than others
but most of the mrd3rers  felt some degree of regret
But when she talked to the convicted rpists
many exhibited a lack of regret
they felt no remorse
This was consistent with the documentary
Indias Daughter which  focused on the Nirbhaya case
When interviewing the rpists
the assailant justified his actions
by questioning why the victim was  out late at night with her boyfriend
expressing a desire to teach her a lesson
Notably it was clear throughout the interview
that he felt no ounce of regret for his actions
Observing this pattern  Madhumita sought to understand
the underlying reasons behind  the lack of regret among rpists
Why do they show no signs of remorse?
She gave them two questionnaires
the MMIS  Multicultural Masculinity Ideology Scale
and an Attitude Towards Women Test
The results indicated that
these individuals held  highly regressive views about women
reflecting backward thinking
Madhumita wasnt the only one to research this
Many such research have  been conducted outside India too
such as Susan Brownmillers 1975 book
Against Our Will Men Women and Rpe
emphasized the same points
In her book she wrote that rpe
is a form of intimidation
often driven by a desire to assert power
and dominance over women
Other researchers including Richard Johnson
Danielle Cusmano and Rebecca Whisnant
came to the same conclusion
Rpe is not driven by a
an unrestrained desire to fornicate
Rather there are three main motives driving rpists
a need to display their power
an outlet for anger
and sadistic cruelty
However a common thread among these motives
is the perpetrators belief in the inferiority of women
This prompts the question
where does this regressive thinking originate?
The answer is Everywhere
Theres a saying that holds true here
A man is the product of his environment
It means that a persons  behaviour personality and identity
are moulded by their surroundings
These factors include everything
the way their parents care for them
their interactions with relatives
experiences in school  with teachers and friends
and exposure to their surrounding environment
Additionally mass media plays a major role in this
Things that are in the news books radio TV ads
social media content songs and movies
significantly influences the formation  of a persons identity and behaviour
Some aspects of your life are within your conscious control
such as what you choose to read or watch
However everything has a  subconscious effect on your mind
that you may not immediately recognize
Some may argue against this by
pointing out that they watch gangster movies
without becoming gangsters themselves
Sandeep Vanga Reddy the director of this film
made a similar argument in an interview
when Anupama Chopra asked him about  the societal impact of films like Kabir Singh
He compared it to watching gangster movies
without becoming a gangster consequently
I grew up watching Gyang Leader
Parinda Ram Lakhan Tezaab
me and my brother never became  gangsters after watching Parinda
This is the same argument that some people use
when justifying eating deepfried food
that are known to increase  the risk of a heart attack
and increasing cholesterol levels
using the argument that they are  still alive and havent suffered a heart attack
The point is having one unhealthy  meal may not cause a heart attack
but if you keep having deepfried food  for days and weeks and years
you may suffer a heart attack someday
And you will always be at an  increased risk of getting a heart attack
Similarly if someone says that they  worked out in the gym for an hour
but havent lost weight yet
we need to remember that  changes are made in small increments
Each droplet adds up to create the ocean
The same can be said about films
Watching one gangster film doesnt make a person a gangster
Nor does watching one good film make a person a great person
But the small incremental changes that  they have on the psyche of the viewers
adds up throughout their lives
Whether it is positive or negative
In the weight loss video  I discussed the multiple factors
including diet exercise sleep and stress management
I pointed out that effective weight  loss is a combination of all these factors
Similarly if everything goes well in a childs life
he has parents who care for him
teachers who treat him well
good friends
he reads good books
he is educated thinks logically
and uses his intellect in every aspect of his life
watching one problematic film wouldnt affect him
However consider the opposite scenario
a boy named Munnu
growing up in a household with  his father beating his mother
restrictive rules for his sister  that arent applicable on him
on YouTube Munnu follows those  YouTubers who objectify women
Saying that women arent capable of thought
And that their only role is to do household chores
On Instagram Munnu follows creators like Andrew Tate
the symbol of toxic masculinity and misogyny
He sees him saying the same stuff
Moreover when Munnu listens to songs
he encounters the same  objectification of women in the lyrics
I am a tandoori chicken
eat me with alcohol
Honey Singhs songs
Have you ever paid attention to their lyrics?
I am a womanizer
Dont meet me alone
I dont hold a girl with silicone
I dont fall in love with a brown girl
I am a lion
I dont graze
You know I am a hunter
I will eat you whole
Even repeating these lyrics feels unsettling
UNICEF has highlighted a report by  American Psychological Association
on how such objectification in mass media
contributes to violence against women
At home Munnu is exposed to news channels
he hears politicians expressing views that
boys are bound to make mistakes
girls shouldnt wear revealing clothes
girls shouldnt be out at night
Television ads also contribute to this  narrative of womens objectification
For instance a perfume ad may depict a girl
hearing four boys taking a shot each
she gets scared by this
only to reveal they were talking about perfume
To make matters worse
when Munnu goes to watch a film in theatres
he watches films like Animal
In this movie the protagonist  twisted his wifes arm violently
grabs her neck
and pointing a gun at her
Some argue that such actions are justified
because the wife slapped him
This is the key issue!
Why should violence regardless of  the gender involved be glorified?
According to Sandeep Vanga
love is not genuine unless you can hit your partner
Im not kidding
Sandeep Vanga had said this  without any sarcasm in an interview
When you are deeply in love
if you dont have the liberty of slapping each other
then I dont see anything there
In the film the protagonist Rannvijay commits numerous mass mrd3rs
yet his wife Geetanjali never even thinks to leave him
However when he has an extramarital affair
she encourages him to kll the other woman
Are you crazy?
You need treatment
Despite being portrayed as a father of a daughter
he mocks the discomfort of menstruation
He tells his wife that this is a mans world
He tells his lover to lick his shoe  to prove that she loves him
The film portrays this character as someone with daddy issues
lacking his fathers love
However Ranvijay exhibits the same  neglect towards his own children
Such behaviours might have been somewhat justified
had the film depicted him as mentally ill
and later undergoing a positive transformation
But that was not to be
There was no redemption at the end of the film
Ranbir Kapoors acting fails to  convey any sense of mental illness
causing the misogyny and  toxic masculinity to be glorified
The protagonist of the film
does all of this with the utmost confidence
Almost like an alpha male
Munnus entire environment is  steeped in regressive views
pervasive objectification of women  and mistreatment of women
Despite this people say  how much damage can one film cause?
Though one film doesnt turn people bad
its part of the toxic environment that we are living in
Such films ensure that the environment remains toxic
Thats why I say that movies like Animal
are cncerous to our society
This was evident on the films poster
Featuring the hero promoting cancer by smoking
what else could one expect?
On the same day Animal was released
another film hit the cinemas
Sam Bahadur
centred around Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw
look at the stark contrast  between the heroes of the two films
Sam Bahadur a reallife hero
who fought for the country and humanity
He played a pivotal role in preventing  a horrific genocide in Bangladesh
Should people like Sam Bahadur be the symbols of masculinity?
Or characters like Kabir Singh and Rannvijay?
For those interested in learning more about his life

Now lets get back to the topic at hand
Lets delve into the narrative of this film
Years ago Mario Puzo authored  a novel titled The Godfather
Famous director Francis Ford Coppola
adapted this novel into a  highly successful trilogy of films
Since then numerous Indian films have copied it
such as Dharmatma Nayakan Dayawan
Aatank Hi Aatank Sarkar
Malik and now Animal
The extent of originality or imitation in this film  is something you can discern for yourself
In The Godfather the plot  revolves around a gangster named Vito
who oversees a vast business empire
His younger son Michael resides abroad in America
However when an assassination attempt is made on Vitos life
Michael returns and
joins the gang
He discovers that the traitor was  his sisters husband Carlo
so he gets Carlo klled
And then he starts getting into conflicts with rival gangs
The Godfather belongs to the gangster genre
but Sandeep Vanga Reddy opted
to make a film that would make millions at the box office
So he copied the concept of his earlier film Kabir Singh
To have a protagonist who would be the antihero
a shorttempered quicktoanger alpha male
who smokes excessively
projecting an image of coolness
And since he knows that showing violence  in the film would draw in more crowds
he decided to heighten the violence
emphasizing bloodshed
During an interview with Anupama Chopra Sandeep expressed
his intent to make his next film even more violent
than Kabir Singh
aiming to push the boundaries of violence in cinema
It will be more
because these guys are calling this a violent film
I want to tell them
Ill show them what a violent film will be
Once Animal was released
his fans enthusiastically share this clip
as a testament to Sandeeps knack for making violent films
Interestingly fans of such films often exhibit a unique characteristic
you would have noticed that
such films draw in the most number of toxic fans
While Bollywood has seen its fair share of mediocre releases
recent films like Tejas Shehzada
or Ranbir Kapoors last film Shamshera
These films were negatively reviewed
audience criticised them extensively
but was anyone offended by this criticism?
No one was triggered
However when films like Kabir Singh and Animal are criticised
some people find it hard to control their outrage
Film critic Sucharita Tyagi for instance  remarked that the film is not entertaining
And the fans of this film resorted to abusing her on Twitter
Why does this happen?
Because some individuals find validation in toxic films
When these films receive criticism
their fans feel that their own personality is being criticised
and their validation is being taken away
However the underlying reason for  the excessive bloodshed in such films
to be completely honest is that violence sells
As Aamir Khan aptly noted
as you can see in this clip
Directors who are not very talented creatively
in creating a story
in showing emotions in creating situations
they depend heavily on violence and sx
to make their films work
This isnt limited to Bollywood
it is equally applicable to Hollywood
This is a new genre of films
known as Slasher films or Gore films
Imagine a conversation between two friends
talking about a new Gore film
Filled with violence and bloodshed
and they plan to watch it
because it will be fun!
It will be fun to watch some broken skulls
someone getting stabbed
it would enliven their evening
Friends there is a psychological reason why
some people love watching extreme  violence and bloodshed on screen
Typically in their lives these individuals
feel powerless and repressed
Oppressed by someone else
Those suppressed by authority figures  whether its a boss
a policeman or even parents at home
people like these are drawn to such gory and violent films
In the theatre they can envision  themselves as the protagonist
finding satisfaction in the violent that  is directed towards someone else
In Animal this violence and  bloodlust is taken to an extreme level
The protagonist doesnt just sht the enemy
he goes on to strngle someone with his bare hands
or slice another persons throat with a knife
Such characters if encountered in real life  would be labelled as psychopaths
The directors glamorize these scenes
presenting them in a stylish manner
resulting in a 15minutelong continuous sequence showcasing bloodshed
Someone aptly tweeted about this film
This film is for the animals  of the animals and by the animals
Ordinarily a person would look at such characters
and understand that they are  psychologically troubled or mentally ill
However when this character seeks help  from a psychotherapist in the film
this point is dismissed
No need to waste the audiences time with such seriousness
there needs to be continuous scenes depicting bloodshed
As Aamir Khan pointed out
cheap directors have nothing else to show
so they keep showing these scenes  to make as much money as possible
Because the truth is
films can portray violence
without glamorizing it
instead of showing it in a stylish way
presenting a realistic depiction
that highlights the negative impact on society
However such realistic films  often struggle at the box office
Some great examples are Anurag Kashyaps works
like Ugly That Girl in Yellow Boots
and Almost Pyaar with DJ Mohabbat
these films offer a social commentary
but people dont want to watch  violence being inflicted by the villain
They find it disturbing and repulsive
There are so many problems in the world already
so why should they watch more violence in cinema halls?
Because the villain inflicting violence fills you with disgust
You are repelled by that violence
you hate watching every moment of such scenes
While this aversion to violence is commendable
no one should be drawn to violence
but the audiences repressed self seeks entertainment
craving violence from the heros standpoint
You want to imagine yourself as James Bond or Kill Bill
or this character from Animal
Directors and producers understand this
they capitalize on this demand
flooding the market with violent action films
Consequently almost all of the recent bigbudget films
heavily feature action and violence
In a review of the film Animal a critic remarked
we have moved passed familyoriented films like Hum Sath Sath Hai
the audience now craves Animal
This is disheartening because Hum Sath Sath Hai
is a heartwarming family drama inspired by the Ramayana
It is a film suitable for the entire family
delivering positive messages to society and  reaching the heart in a way that fosters unity
In the Ramayana video I discussed the virtues of Lord Ram
highlighting qualities like humility compassion
despite being fit and strong
Such a man should be the ideal model  of masculinity for our society
However some individuals reject such models
because they lack compassion and empathy themselves
A human with no companssion
is an animal not a human
Literally an animal
Characters like Kabir Singh and Rannvijay  in Sandeep Vangas film
exemplify a lack of selfcontrol
Kabir Singh indulges in drinking and consuming drugs
while Rannvijay resorts to shouting beating
and even threatening his wife with a gun when angered
Can such characters truly serve as role models?
Those who appreciate such regressive characters
used to call themselves Macho Man until recently
However in the past few years a new term  has popped up on social media for such people
Alpha Male
They call themselves Alpha Male
If you are sensible you will stay away  from such a destructive way of thinking
Stop watching such films
Our minds are not dustbins
we should respect our minds
If you have friends who enjoy such films
consider sharing this video with them to illustrate
how these films are like a cncer to our society

12th October 1972
A small chartered aircraft  took off from Uruguay South America
This aircraft was going to  Santiago the capital of Chile
Carrying some rugby players tall and broad
There were 45 passengers in total
some of the players family and friends had tagged along
This flight was not going to be long
Usually it takes only 3 hours  to go from Uruguay to Santiago
But on the way you come across the huge Andes Mountains
The Andes Mountain Range in South America
is the worlds longest mountain range
Other than the Himalayan mountains
the highest mountains are found here
These beautiful mountains become  devastating for the passengers in our story
That day on 12th October
there was a storm in the mountains
because of which the plane couldnt keep flying
The pilots then decided
to stop midway
and try to fly again the next day
The plane landed in Mendoza Argentina for the night
The next day on October 13th
the plane took off again at 218 pm
The pilots ensured that the weather had cleared up
So it was a smoothsailing flight for the next hour
At 321 pm the pilots start descending the plane
The plane was quite close to Santiago
but was still in the mountains
Since there are high mountains right next to the city
While descending suddenly there was terrible turbulence
The plane started shaking horizontally
Around this time clouds gathered around the plane
Nothing was visible except the clouds
Suddenly the alarms in the plane went off
and the warning lights began to flash
No one could understand why
The rugby players in the passenger seats werent scared
They didnt take this turbulence seriously
Amid jokes a passenger looked out of the window
and saw the clouds clearing up
But then he noticed that they were  perilously close to a mountain
As soon as the aircraft moved out of the clouds
the pilots realized that they were moving towards a huge rock
Immediately in a panic
they try to lift the plane up
The aircrafts ground collision alarm was ringing loudly
Pilots put in maximum power into gaining altitude
To fly over the mountain safely
But unfortunately it was too late
The rear of the aircraft collided  with the mountain while going up
The entire rear portion of the plane separateed
The two rows of seats at the back
literally flew out of the plane
Three passengers flew away with it and disappeared
The plane kept flying upwards for a few more seconds
but then suddenly it started to fall down
After a few seconds another collision happened
The left wing of the plane broke
Some more passengers flew  out of the plane and fell down
Now only the front portion of the plane remained
and it fell into a glacier
It slid down the glacier at a speed of 350 kmh
and finally it crashed after dropping 700 meters
Everything in the plane was destroyed
The passenger seats were torn apart from the base of the plane
The cockpit of the plane was completely crushed
and the pilots were killed immediately
This aircraft lay broken on an  unknown mountain in the Andes
at a height of 3570 meters
Surprisingly out of the 45 people on board
33 were still alive
They had somehow survived this crash
The problem was that many of them were injured
and no one knew where they were stuck
It was later found that this plane
was 80 km off from its planned route
And this painful story of survival
had just begun friends
Neither those people could have imagined at that time
nor you can imagine now
what happened to these survivors next
This is the heartwrenching story
of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571
Lets know about it in todays video
Plane crashed in Andes Mountains
45 persons were aboard
Given up for dad
Survival fascinates people
All of the passengers were given up for dad
It became known as the Miracle of the Andes
Right after this crash
there were two survivors who werent seriously injured
First 19yearold Roberto Canessa
and the other 20yearold Gustavo Zerbino
Since both of them were medical students
they immediately started checking
who was alive and how to help the injured
They saw that many passengers
had suffered severe injuries
One of them was 23yearold Fernando Parrado
who was in a coma due to a skull fracture
These two medical students tried their best
to help the survivors
On the other hand within an hour of the planes disappearance
the Chilean Air Search and Rescue Service received a notification
Four aircraft were deployed to search for the survivors
They tried to find the crash site from dusk till night
but unfortunately they didnt find anything
The rescue service officers concluded after hearing the radio transmissions
that the aircraft must have crashed in a remote and inaccessible area
The problem was that the aircraft was white in colour
and it had crashed in a place where
there was white snow and ice all around
It was very difficult to locate it in the snowy mountains
On the night of 13th October
the remaining passengers were very hopeful
They hoped that if they would somehow spent a night there
and find a way to escape the cold
then someone would find them the next day
Five injured passengers couldnt survive that snowy night
The number of survivors fell from 33 to 28
These survivors used the remaining body of the plane as a shelter
They used luggage seats and snow
to close the rear of the plane
so that they could stay warm inside
The next day on 14th October
11 different aircraft from Argentina Chile and Uruguay
were put into search operation
The search area they chose was correct
The location of the crash site was in that search area
But still they were not able to find the crash site
Survivors tried to use lipstick to write SOS on the planes roof
They started writing SOS
but soon realized that
they didnt have enough lipstick to write all the letters
Then they tried to use suitcases to make a big cross in the snow
so that search aircraft flying above could see them
But soon they realized that this was not working
That day they saw not one not two but three aircraft flying over them
They screamed waved their hands and tried their best
to make the aircraft notice them
but they were unsuccessful
Another day passed in this attempt
The next day 15th October
the survivors realized that
they needed water to stay alive
A passenger named Fito Strauch
found a way to get water
He used a metal sheet as a solar collector
so that the sunrays could be concentrated
to melt the snow
And he collected water droplets in empty wine bottles
Apart from this many passengers used the seat cushions like snowshoes
and the wool in the seat covers was used
to protect them from the cold
The next day on 16th October
three days after the crash
Fernando Parrado woke up from his coma
As soon as he regained consciousness
he saw that his mother passed away in the crash
and his 19yearold sister was severely injured
Parrado tried his best to keep his sister alive
he brought food and water for her
But as the days went by
8 days after the crash
his sister succumbed to her injuries
Such accidents remind us
how uncertain life is
and how unpredictable it is
We dont know how long we will live
Thats why it is said
Live every moment
Live every day every moment in your life
because who knows tomorrow may not come
But theres also the question of
In our daily lives

Just remember one thing
the course is in English
Most of the passengers were from coastal areas
Before this they had never seen snow
And now suddenly in the cold of 30 Celsius
at such a high altitude without proper food and water
they were somehow surviving
In these bad conditions there was another problem
Snow blindness
When the ultraviolet rays of the sun reflect  on the snow and ice in the mountains
it can damage your eyes
This is called snow blindness
These survivors had only 3 pairs of sunglasses
On 21st October 8 days after the crash
search and rescue teams gave up
They believed that since they could not find any signs of survivors in those 8 days
there was no point in continuing the search operation
There was little chance that anyone could have survived after so many days
So after 142 hours of search operation
this search operation was officially stopped
Meanwhile the survivors found a transistor radio
among the seats of the aircraft
A survivor rugby player Roy Harley
was also an electronics enthusiast
So he tried to switch on the radio
He made a long antennae by improvising
And because of his efforts finally the radio started working
This radio could communicate one way only
The survivors could hear things
but could not send any messages
They turned on the radio 11 days after the crash
and then they came to know that
the search operation had been cancelled
Their hearts were completely broken
Some people start crying after hearing this news
Some people clasped their hands and started praying to God
Feeling that their world is alive
and they consider you dead
Fernando Parrado was the only one who did not react much after hearing this news
Because he was planning something else
By the 11th day survivors were running out of food
They didnt have much to begin with
There were only 8 chocolate bars
1 tin of mussels
3 small jars of jam
a jar of almonds
A box of peanuts some dates candies dried plums
and a few bottles of wine
A few days after the crash they started rationing food
They ate very little each day
Parrado ate a chocolatecovered peanut for 3 days
Just one peanut
But rationing was not enough
Because the food was almost over
There were no trees or plants at an altitude of 3800 meters
nor were there any animals that could be killed and eaten
By the 11th day the food was completely gone
and some people tried to eat some parts of the plane
They tried eating the cotton in the seats
and the leather on the seats
But this made them more sick
In such a situation when there was  no option other than starving to dath
these survivors did something
that will shock you
To stay alive they decided
there was no option other than eating  the dad bodies of their friends and family
It was not an easy decision to make
Because most of the people who were klled in this crash
were friends classmates family members or relatives
We have to eat
and the only probable things
were the dad bodies  of the people that were in this plane
Since Canessa came up with this idea
he was the first to try it
Some others tried to but they couldnt
They refused then
But 2 days later
with no other option
finally even they chose to eat human meat
On 29th October 16 days after the crash
this food source was also depleting rapidly for the survivors
They had no plan of action
No one knew what to do next
The situation could not have been worse
But then that night
they heard a loud grumble
It turned out to be an avalanche
Large amount of snow was descending so fast from the mountain top
that it filled the broken plane with snow
Eight people were lost in the snow and suffocated
Only 19 survivors remained
Ted Roberto you had it  Youre going to d!e
Thats it
A very nice sensation of heat between my legs
because I was peeing on myself
and saying thats it
These remaining 19 people were also  trapped in a small space under the snow
Parrado used a metal pole
to make a hole in the snow
to allow some ventilation
After working hard for two days
they dug a tunnel under the snow
and with great difficulty they managed to get to the surface
As soon as they got out
they saw a snowstorm was coming
and it would be prudent to go back  into the snow cave to survive
For the next three days the remaining survivors
somehow managed to stay in the cramped space
3 days later they went back up to the surface
and the weather was clear
After coming out the survivors realized that
no one was coming to save them
If they wanted to stay alive
they would need to put in the efforts themselves
There was no point in sitting at the crash site waiting for help
They needed to try their best till the last breath
Canessa Parrado and Vizintin
were among the strongest survivors
They decided together
to give them more food and the warmest clothes
and they would try to walk around looking for help
The first task was to estimate the location
Before the crash
the copilot had stated that
their aircraft had passed through Curico
So they estimated that
if they walked a few kilometres to the west
they would definitely reach some countryside areas of Chile
But their estimation was extremely wrong
Actually the copilot didnt know
where he was taking the plane
In reality their crash site
was 89 km east
in the middle of the Andes mountains
Still unaware of this
they rested for a few days to build up their energy
On November 15 33 days after the crash
these three people set out to find help
After travelling for hours towards the east
they found the rear piece of their aircraft
It was the part of the plane that had broken apart first
Inside it they found many suitcases
boxes of chocolates three meat patties
a bottle of rum extra clothes
comic books and some medicines
And along with this they found
the aircrafts twoway radio system
A radio that can not only facilitate incoming communication
but can also send messages
They decided to spend the night there
The next day of the expedition
they walk a little further east
but after discussing it they believed that
they should try to turn on the aircrafts radio
They decided to get some batteries out of the main body of the aircraft
and then try to start the radio
They would be able to send out an SOS call
They found 24 kg batteries in the tail section
but it was very heavy
They could not carry it back to the main body crash site
So they decided to try to turn it on right there
They went back and took the help of Roy Harley
the one who had some knowledge of electronics
but unfortunately this plan didnt work
The thing was that
the aircrafts electrical system
worked with a 115V AC
and their battery was a 24V DC
They had no means to connect them
They tried their best to start the radio for a few days
but soon realized that there was no other way
To survive they now had to start walking Westwards
On 11th December 59 days after the crash
an avalanche hit
Three more survivors were k!lled in it
I was trapped completely by the storm the avalanche
it was the most dadly silence that you may imagine
I couldnt move
Only 16 remained
To climb the mountains in the west
they needed a way to sleep at night
How could they survive the cold nights of 30 Celsius?
Among the survivors was an 18yearold boy
Carlos Miguel Rodriguez
He remembered that his mother had taught him to sew with needles
He was carrying his needles and sewing kit with him
His idea was to stitch different pieces of clothing
to make a big sleeping bag
I had the idea that with the insulation
you can make a sleeping bag
But I not only had the idea
I made it myself
They did this
The next day December 12
two months had passed since the day this crash happened
These three brave men Parrado Canessa and Vizintin
set out without any mountaineering gear
to climb the glacier
The only certain thing was to the West was Chile
Going westward meant that
they would have to climb the mountain first
before going down
They still believed that
they were only a few kilometres away
So they hoped that they would find help by walking for 23 days
So they packed a 3day supply of meat
And you can imagine
without any skill without any training
youre like a child!
You are confronted with a snowstorm
you try to go straight up
you might be using your hands and your feet
youre slipping and sliding
And with every step that you go up
you slide back half a step
To protect himself against the cold Parrado wore three pairs of jeans
He was also wearing 3 sweaters on top of his tshirt
and 4 pairs of socks on his feet
He was also wearing a plastic shopping bag over the socks
The cold was so bad
They had no technical gear
no map no compass
and no climbing experience
And at this height the air gets quite thin
and one starts feeling the lack of oxygen
But despite that
they kept moving forward towards the mountain
The sleeping bag they had stitched
was useful at night
During the day they kept moving forward taking slow steps
The three of them in that one sleeping bag
slept as close to each other as possible
And as soon as the sun rose they started walking
Gradually they kept moving forward together
The second day the third day
and on the morning of the fourth day they realized that
their estimation was grossly wrong
Ahead they could see no end to their journey
Because they had little to no food
Vizintin decided to return to the crash site
and only the other two would go ahead
so that less food was needed
On 15th December Vizintin started going back
which was easier
because it was all downhill
He used an aircraft seat as a sleigh
and within an hour he reached the crash site
It took them three days to climb this mountain
but in just one hour
he was back at the crash site
Parrado and Canessa kept climbing the mountain
After three hours
they reached the peak of the mountain
and saw that all around them
there was only mountains as far as they could see
There was nothing except the snowy mountains
I couldnt breathe
I couldnt speak
I couldnt even think
because what we saw was horrible
Instead of green valleys
we saw mountains
and snowcovered peaks
360 around us
to the horizon all around us
With great difficulty Parrado tried to find something else to see
On the far western horizon
they saw two mountains peaks
without snow
They assumed that they should keep travelling in that direction
They couldnt give up
Parrado and Canessa keep hiking for many days
Finally they reached a valley
A valley where they could see a river flowing
In this situation reaching the river was a great relief
Because while travelling downstream the river
it was easy to find a downhill path
They kept on walking and walking
And finally after trekking for 9 days
on 20th December
they could find some presence of humans
They could see some cows in the fields
They were so tired by this point
that they couldnt walk farther
Right then on the other side of the river
Look a man on a horse!
They saw 3 men on horses
Parrado tried to shout
But the river was so loud that those people couldnt hear him
But by chance one of them spotted Parrado and Canessa
He looked at them and shouted back
He said that he would be back the next day
The next day the man comes back on horseback
and this time brought some paper and pencils with him
He attached the paper and pencil to a stone with a thread
and threw it to the other side of the river
For the first time Parrado had the opportunity to send his message to the world
Parado wrote in Spanish on the paper
I come from a plane that fell in the mountains
That he was from Uruguay
And had been walking for 10 days
And that his injured friends were at the crash site
He wrote that they needed help urgently
but didnt know how to get help
They didnt have any food
They were weak
And they didnt have it in them to walk anymore
He asked to be saved
He asked where they were
On the other hand the person who received this message
was a farmer from Chile
Sergio Catalan
He read this note
and told him with gestures that he understood
After talking to his two friends
it turned out that they did remember vaguely
A few months ago they had heard on the news that a plane crashed
And when these friends realized this
they were shocked
They couldnt believe that there were  survivors of a 2monthold plane crash
Sergio threw a piece of bread to the other side of the river
and for the next 10 hours
on a horse he rode towards west
They were still so far from any village or human settlement
Finally when he reached the nearest city
the army command was informed about this
and he contacted the army headquarters in Santiago
Meanwhile the farmers brought Parrado and Canessa to Los Maitenes on horses
Where they finally get some rest
It was found that on sheer will
they had hiked 61 km on foot over the last 10 days
Canessa had lost half of his body weight
He weighed only 44 kgs then
As soon as other people got to know about their story
it became international news
This heartwrenching story was truly unbelievable
The Chilean Air Force sends 3 helicopters to immediately rescue the survivors
Army officers interviewed Parrado and Canessa
to get information about the location
Parrado had brought the pilots flight chart with him
and he had plotted the places where they were hiking
Army officers took him with them on the helicopter
to locate the crash site
With Parrados help the location of the remaining survivors
was finally discovered by the army commanders
On 22nd December 1972
70 days after the crash
two search and rescue helicopters finally reached
the survivors to save their lives
In total 16 survivors were rescued
They were in a terrible condition
Altitude sickness dehydration
broken bones malnutrition
But all of them recovered
This story is a lesson to the world about hope
If you have decided to do something
and you have patience and humanity
then nothing is impossible
If you want you can achieve things
that you can never even dream of
As they say Where theres a will theres a way
Thats why there is another name for this disaster
the Miracle of the Andes
If you liked the video I have made many more videos

One of the worlds most courageous military commanders
widely recognized as the most powerful king in Europe
was Napoleon Bonaparte
However he remains one of historys most controversial figures
with some praising his capabilities
while others criticize his hunger for power
Questions about the immense loss of life attributed to him persist
What is the truth?
Was he a hero of the masses or the vilest of villains?
Director Ridley Scott is set to release  a film titled Napoleon on November 24th
Scott known for directing acclaimed films  such as Gladiator The Martian and Prometheus
the trailer of the film promises an intriguing portrayal
featuring Joaquin Phoenix as Napoleon
Phoenix notably played the role of  Joker in the film of the same name
So I thought this is the perfect time
to get to know Napoleon Bonapartes story
Napoleon was born on 15th August 1769
on the island of Corsica
Look at the map it is an island  situated between France and Italy
Noteworthy for being the backdrop of the song Matargasti
from the film Tamasha starring  Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone
Corsica during the 1700s
was under the rule of a country that doesnt exist any longer
Republic of Genoa
This was the flag of the Republic of Genoa
Several territories that are now part of Italy and Greece
were under the control of this country
One such territory was Corsica
but the Corsicians were fed up with Genoan rule
They were fueled by a burgeoning sense of nationalism
and a desire to live in a free country
Pasquale Paoli emerged as a leader in  the Corsican struggle for independence
and a young Napoleon embraced Corsican nationalism
inspired by his childhood idol Paoli
By the 1760s Corsica found itself embroiled in war
while the Republic of Genoa
burdened by debt and war
decided to literally sell the island of Corsica to France in 1768
This decision caused unrest among Corsican freedom fighters
but there wasnt much that they could do
Resisting the might of Frances imperial power proved challenging
The turning point came in 1769 when  the French army clashed with Corsican forces
During the Battle of Ponte Novu
Following a swift victory France
claimed Corsica as its territory
Shortly thereafter Napoleon Bonaparte was born
His father Carlo
was a lawyer who initially fought  alongside Corsican freedom fighters
But after the French armys triumph
Paoli had to flee the country
And Carlo switched allegiance
The shift was notable as Carlo became an  ardent supporter of the French royalty
He used connections to make advances in his career
He secured the status of Nobility
By 1777 he became Corsicas representative
to the court of the new French king Louis XVI
This transformation bothered Napoleon
He harboured no fondness for his father
He viewed his father as a coward and deserter
But it was his fathers connections that
Napoleon and his brother Joseph secured scholarships
enabling Napoleon to enrol in the French Military College
At the college Napoleon was surrounded  by the children of French aristocrats
he faced ridicule at school
due to his distinctive accent
Unfazed he refrained from socialising with his peers
viewing the French as colonizers
His dream was to witness his country Corsica achieve independence
Napoleons isolation drove him to find solace in books
particularly drawn to Enlightenmentage philosopher JeanJacques Rousseau
the primary reason for that was  Rousseau wrote about Corsican freedom
and considered the Corsicians brave in his writings
In addition to philosophy
Napoleon exhibited a keen interest in mathematics history and geography
excelling in these subjects
Among his favourite reads was Plutarchs Parallel Lives
a compilation of 45 biographies featuring historical figures
like Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar
Napoleon found inspiration in Caesar  often drawing comparisons
Upon completing his schooling
Napoleon joined a military academy in Paris
specializing in artillery
Graduating as the second lieutenant  of the Royal Artillery in the French army
during all of this he would often return to Corsica
continuing to idolize Pasquale Paoli
However the landscape changed in 1789
with the onset of the French Revolution
I have made a separate video on the French Revolution
in case you havent watched it you can watch it after this
During this period Corsica fell under the  jurisdiction of the new French National Assembly
leading to the pardon of Pasquale Paoli
After a 20year exile Paoli returned
and was greeted warmly by the people of Corsica
including Napoleon
Subsequent elections in Corsica  saw Pasquale Paoli emerge victorious
becoming the President
Despite Napoleons traitorous father having passed away by the time
and Napoleon holding Paoli in high regard
Paoli harboured resentment toward Napoleons family
Consequently Paoli declared that such  traitorous families could not live in Corsica
prompting Napoleon and his family
to relocate from Corsica to France
in June 1793
Following this Paoli severed ties with  the French Revolutionary Assembly
aligning himself with their enemy the British
This is why in 1794
the AngloCorsican Kingdom was established
expelling France from Corsica
and rendering it a puppet state under British control
However this arrangement lasted only two years
In 1796 France launched an attack
reclaiming Corsica from British rule
Meanwhile France was embroiled in a civil war
marked by various factions of
French revolutionaries and counterrevolutionaries
People divided into various groups were fighting among themselves
In 1793 a political group named Jacobins
came to power and formed the French government
The group was led by Maximillien Robespierre
During this tumultuous period
Napoleon expressed his support for the  Jacobin government in a political pamphlet
This caught the attention of Robespierres brother
it greatly impressed him
This gave a boost to Napoleons career prospects
In September 1793 an event occurred that
further elevated Napoleons popularity
Toulon a French naval base
witnessed an uprising by a group
and subsequent attacks by the British forces
The French Army dispatched Napoleon  to take command at this location
Napoleon was then serving as  Senior Gunner and Artillery Commander
Napoleon proposed a strategic plan to win  this conflict
and shared it with his commanders
The plan included capturing a fort
securing a hill for artillery dominance
and launching attacks on British ships
His plan was executed
with Napoleon fighting with remarkable bravery
and suffering significant injuries
but after three months of struggle the French army emerged victorious
The General of the French Army Dugomere  speaking about Napoleon stated
I have no words to describe Bonapartes merit
much technical skill an equal degree  of intelligence and too much gallantry
Napoleon is an amazing man
In recognition of his contributions Napoleon  was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General
at the young age of 24
During this period France remained  embroiled in a civil war
and Maximilian Robespierre sought to implement reforms
Such as universal male suffrage
granting voting rights to all men above 18
While women were not granted political rights
significant reforms were instituted for them
including the right to divorce
an option that was previously unavailable to women
Additionally women gained access to  the right to education and work opportunities
Robespierres influence extended to the abolition of slavery in France
and the French colonies
leaving a lasting impact reflected in
numerous roads and metro stations  named after him in France
However Robespierres tenure was marked by controversy
particularly because of the Reign of Terror
In an effort to quash opposition to the French Revolution
thousands were executed on suspicion alone
leading to the d3ath of at least 20000 French citizens
Simultaneously the government initiated the  dismantling of Catholic Christianity in France
confiscating church properties
and promoting a singular Supreme God
to be revered through acts of service to the people
Amid these challenges and instability
a coup unfolded in July 1794 against the Jacobins government
resulting in its complete overthrow
and Robespierres execution
In August 1794 since Napoleon  supported the toppled government
he was imprisoned
He vigorously defended himself
securing his release from jail after only a few weeks
The orchestrator of this coup was  the wellknown figure Paul Barras
who had known Napoleon since the Siege of Toulon
and gradually developed a favourable opinion of him
In October 1795 Napoleon was entrusted with the task of
quelling a revolution
despite the French army facing  a numerical disadvantage of 1 to 6
Employing 40 cannons and limited infantry
Napoleon successfully suppressed the uprising within 2 hours
This pleased Paul Barras who then gave him the title of General
Napoleon became a national hero
At just 27 years old
he assumed the role of General in the French Army
Shortly thereafter he took command
of the Army of Italy
not the Italian Army
Rather the French forces operating in Italy
They were known as the Army of Italy
The troops lacked motivation discipline and supplies
Napoleon addressed this by delivering compelling speeches
emphasizing the importance of discipline for victory
and condemning looting and pillaging in conquered territories
asserting that only cowards engage in such actions
Napoleons armies didnt loot or pillage territories
Despite this Napoleon did indulge in  one form of appropriationart
Thats right
His passion for art stemmed from his  desire to establish a universal museum in Paris
showcasing a vast collection of  artworks from around the world
In later years he even renamed  the Louvre Museum
naming the museum after himself
Getting back to the Army of Italy
Napoleon led them in a famous battle against the Austrians
the Battle of Arcole
This famous painting depicts this battle
Napoleons tactics involved
rapid troop movement varied formations
and surprise attacks on the enemy
Using these Napoleons troops won the Battle of Arcole
In 1798 as France contemplated  invading the British Isles
Napoleon upon his return to Paris
refused to fight in this battle
He argued that the British Navy was formidable
and it made any invasion impractical
He proposed an alternative campaign
in the Mediterranean
Advancing southward to capture Egypt
and blocking the route of the British to India
Afterwards Napoleon planned to  assist Tipu Sultan of Mysore
in his struggle against the British
Commencing his Mediterranean campaign with 40000 soldiers
Napoleon and his soldiers set sail for  Toulon boarding numerous ships
In addition to the soldiers
he brought along over 160  scientists scholars and artists
aiming to document valuable knowledge acquired in new territories
The army progressed southward
capturing the island of Malta
before landing on the Egyptian coast in Alexandria
Battles such as the Battle of Alexandria  and the Battle of the Pyramids unfolded
Following the footsteps of Alexander the Great
and Ceaser
and destined for greatness
Resulting in victories against the Ottoman army and local kings
The French flag flew over the Citadel of Qaitbay
Look at these photos from presentday Egypt
Napoleon established the Institute of Egypt
to systematically study the countrys  history culture and resources
concurrently promoting Enlightenment ideals in Egypt
However the success of Napoleons plan was shortlived
Within a few weeks in August 1798
a formidable fleet of the British Navy attacked the French
leading to the destruction of numerous French ships
and the d3ath of a French admiral
in the Battle of the Nile
depicted in this historic painting showing numerous destroyed French ships
A year later in August 1799
following continued defeats
Napoleon clandestinely abandoned  his army and fled from Egypt
Although Napoleons military campaign was a substantial failure
Let alone reaching India and helping Tipu Sultan
Napoleon lost his hold on Egypt too
And Malta which was captured first
was recaptured by the British
Youd be wondering why Im mentioning this failure
For two reasons
Firstly despite its military setbacks the campaign
was scientifically successful
Notably the discovery of the Rosetta Stone
a slab inscribed with the same message in three different languages
the key to our understanding of the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics
The Rosetta Stone had been previously discussed  in the video on the Indus Valley Civilization
For further insights into this remarkable  artifact you may refer to that video
Additionally French scientists made significant discoveries
about the types of trees and plants indigenous to Egypt
They explored the topography of Egypt
studied architectural designs
and documented the utilization  of Egyptian jars for food preservation
The second reason why this seemingly  unsuccessful campaign holds importance
lies in Napoleons reception upon returning to France
he was welcomed as a hero
You must be perplexed by how
Napoleon who lost the territories  and abandoned his army
is welcomed as a hero?
This was due to the extensive proNapoleon  propaganda that had been ongoing for years
A multitude of mediums ranging from newspapers to paintings
official bulletins songs and poems
Napoleon was being praised throughout France
There were 6 newspapers in France back then
some of them were established by Napoleon himself
while Napoleon tookover the control over the others
These newspapers printed about various battles
The narrative in the newspapers would be set by Napoleon himself
Napoleon presented himself as a knowledgeable person
Several positive paintings and sketches were used
to depict his heroic battles
When he chose the scientists for his Mediterranean campaign
the newspapers printed seven pages  writing about each minute of the meeting
Napoleons speeches to his soldiers were widely published
along with his childhood stories  both factual and fictional
Imaginary stories of Napoleons childhood were created
of the great deeds he never did
An intriguing narrative emerged around  Napoleons love for Josephine
this romantic relationship has been  portrayed in depth in this film
Director Ridley Scott claims that Napoleons conquered the world
to win over Josephines love
But when he couldnt
he conquered the world to destroy her
Destroying himself in the process
I wont talk about this films plot too much in this video
you can watch the movie to know more
Returning to the discussion of propaganda
lets examine these propaganda paintings
One notable piece commissioned by Napoleon himself
depicts his Mediterranean campaign
portraying him helping the sick in Jaffa
and drawing parallels to Jesus Christ
Another example is this painting
illustrating the Battle of Marengo
fought between the French and Austrian armies in 1800
where Napoleon is depicted crossing the Alps on horseback
youd note that this painting is inspired by Alexanders sculpture
But why is this a propaganda painting?
Because this isnt how Napoleon crossed the Alps
Look at this painting from 1850
this is how he crossed the Alps
On a mule guided by a farmer
These propaganda paintings served a specific purpose
to show Napoleon as the hero crossing the Alps on a horse
The aim of the propaganda was to
advance Napoleons ultimate goal
his final ambition
To be on the throne
When Napoleon returned to France from Egypt
there was widespread conflict and corruption reports in France
Napoleon orchestrated a coup in November 1799
This led to the expulsion of the existing government
and the establishment of a new Consulate government
with Napoleon as the First Consul of the new government
Two individuals were appointed as aiding consuls
and a new constitution was introduced in France
Most French citizens didnt disapprove of it
due to the widespread influence of propaganda
portraying Napoleon as a figure transcending politics
acting solely in the French national interest
and championing Enlightenment ideas
To solidify public approval on the new Constitution
a referendum was held in France
and the results announced by Napoleons brother  Lucien the Minister of Interiors in France
that 999 of the 3013000 voters
supported the new constitution
It shows that 999 of the French citizens favoured Napoleon
Was that true? Absolutely not
In reality approximately 15 million votes  were cast in favour of Napoleon
French historian Claude Langlois presented evidence in 1972
revealing that the 1800 referendum was a complete fraud
with slightly over 50 of the votes cast were in favour of Napoleon
Two years later another referendum took place in 1802
where Napoleon posed the question to the public
Should he be appointed Consul for Life?
Once again the public voted
with 997 voters
supporting Napoleon to hold power for life
Even after two fraud referendums Napoleon sought further validation
In 1804 a third referendum was conducted
asking if Napoleon should become the King of France
And the result of the referendum was that
999 of the voters
voted in favour of Napoleon becoming the king
Napoleon wasnt greedy for the power
but became the King to appease the masses
Im kidding thats not how it went
Napoleon wasnt one to hide his greed for power
He openly embraced his love for power
famously declaring Power is my mistress
I have worked too hard at her conquest
to allow anyone to take her away from me
Back then this hunger for power
was a characteristic accepted among  kings and nobles of the time
Over the next decade driven by Napoleons love for power
he engaged in a series of battles across Europe
interspersed with peace treaties
such as the one signed with Britain in 1802
However the resumption of wars was inevitable
as both Napoleon and the British thirsted for power
Many European nations engaged in wars with Napoleon
not only for power but also for their survival
Many European kings and monarchs felt  threatened by the French revolutionary ideology
They considered Napolean a threat to their kingdom
In the French Revolution video I explained that
the ideology of Nationalism was introduced by the Enlightenment thinkers
Such as Rousseau and Voltaire
These were the ideologies of leftwing revolutionaries
While the rightwing adhered to  supporting monarchies and social hierarchy
preserving the existing system
The leftwing ideology championed equality
freedom and the aspiration for national freedom
evolving into the foundation of Republicanism
This nationalist fervour
was quickly spreading across other  European nations during that period
leading to the emergence of revolutionaries
challenging the reigning monarchies
In response these monarchs formed coalitions
sparking a series of coalition wars  between 1792 and 1815
where monarchies collectively waged war against France
In this context Napoleons role can be seen as
that of a liberator
propagating the slogans of freedom  and revolution throughout Europe
When Napoleons forces entered Italy he declared
to the Italian people that the French army
had come to break their chains
He told them that he bore no ill will against the masses
rather they were there to liberate them  from kings and emperors
who had oppressed them
This is why in Milan Italy  Napoleon was viewed as a hero
For liberating them from Austrian rule under King Francis II
Italian revolutionary and poet Yugo Foscolo
in 1802 said this about him
I will name you therefore Bonaparte
with the unheardof title of Liberator  of Peoples and Founder of Republics
Additionally in 1803 on of the  most renowned music composer
Beethoven paid tribute to Napoleon by  naming his Symphony No 3 after him
He named the Symphony No 3
Beethoven considered Napoleon a hero
for promoting democratic ideology  and opposing monarchy in Europe
However how could he be a hero when
he crowned himself the king
and conducted fraudulent referendums?
When Beethoven learned of Napoleon declaring himself a king
he angrily proclaimed that
Napoleon was just a man not a deity
susceptible to the lure of power  and capable of oppressing people
Beethoven subsequently removed  Napoleons name from his symphony
Indeed Napoleons decisions deviated from  the principles of the French Revolution
In 1802 he enacted two laws that
reinstated practices of slavery
Furthermore his views on women were regressive
emphasizing the importance of women  based on the number of children she bore
Napoleon revoked many rights granted to women
during the French Revolution
reinstating priority given to men in divorce laws
Although the French Revolution had  championed freedom of expression
Napoleon gradually imposed restrictions on it
Dissenters who spoke against him were exiled
and free newspapers were systematically shut down
Despite bringing stability to France
Napoleons rule maintained a dictatorial character
If he genuinely aimed to propagate  the ideas of the French Revolution
he could have reinstated democracy in France
I began this video by talking about Corsica
How Corsican independence was Napoleons childhood dream
Yet as a king he never pursued the liberation of Corsica
Instead of bringing democracy to France
Napoleon appointed his brothers as  kings in the conquered territories
In May 1808
France initiated a war against Spain
resulting in the Spanish King Carlos IV stepping down
and Napoleon installing his brother Joseph as the new ruler
Before this Joseph had been  the king of Naples and Sicily
Napoleons younger brother Jerome  was crowned the king of Westphalia
a region in presentday Germany
Additionally when the Kingdom of Holland  fell under Napoleons control in 1806
Louis another of Napoleons brothers  was made the king of that region
However amidst this hunger for power
there is a positive legacy  left by Napoleon worth noting
Several decisions he made had farreaching  benefits for the future of France and Europe
The Napoleonic Code of 1804
stands out as a landmark legal framework providing France
with a comprehensive and written set of laws
The second achievement was the establishment  of equality for males under the law
despite the setbacks for womens rights
and the reintroduction of slavery
The equal rights given to the male citizens by the law
remained unchanged
Furthermore Napoleons era marked  the end of feudalism in France
In the territories he occupied
the same laws were enforced
Third Secularism
During Napoleons rule the French  government adopted a secular stance
There was religious freedom in France
allowing individuals to practice their chosen religions
In 1801 Christianity did return to France
when Napoleon signed an agreement with the Pope
But the relationship between the Church and the Government
never fully went back to the way it used to be
The power balance shifted more favourably towards the government
While traditional positions of the  Catholic clergy in the Church were restored
the government retained control over the selection of bishops
and supervised the churchs finances
significantly diminishing the influence  of the church in European affairs
Fourth establishing a banking system
The Bank of France was founded by Napoleon in 1800
It brought hyperinflation under control
and stabilized the currency
Fifth he introduced a modern and efficient tax system
ending the exemptions previously granted to nobility and kings
ensuring that everyone contributed to the tax base
Sixth in the education system
Napoleon set up primary secondary and high schools
along with establishing the University of France
Uniformity was introduced to the education system
teachers were trained
and a centralized recruitment process for teachers was initiated
The government also regulated technical schools  civil service schools and military schools
leading to a rapid improvement  in the overall quality of education
Seventh water distribution
In 1808 Napoleon modernized Pariss water  distribution system by upgrading old pumps
constructing a new canal
to direct water to the city
and building 15 water fountains
He ensured that Parisians would never starve
Storehouses and granaries were modernized
and eight new markets were constructed
wine market wheat market
everything happened in an organised manner
In conclusion despite Napoleons hunger for power
he wasnt a clueless ruler
Napoleon emerged as a highly intelligent and effective administrator
implementing several positive reforms for the French people
Some people draw comparisons  between Napoleon and Hitler
which in my opinion are entirely inaccurate
as Napoleon did not propagate hatred  against any religion or community
nor did he employ strategies of divide and rule
While Napoleons actions resulted in the d3aths of millions
but he was driven by his thirst for war and power
Finally lets talk about how Napoleon d!ed
Despite his numerous victories  he also faced defeats
Such as Napoleons Egyptian campaign as discussed earlier
Napoleon had installed a Continental System
a comprehensive economic blockade against Britain
by all French allied countries
When Russia violated this continental system in 1812
Napoleon launched an attack on Russia
The Russian forces refused to fight
They would retreat and set fire to the battlefield
leaving nothing for Napoleons troops as provisions
Even so Napoleons army reached Moscow
but the city was empty
and after a month of waiting for the Russians to surrender
to no avail
Napoleons hungry army had to retreat from the barren city
The next year in 1813
a coalition comprising the United Kingdom  Russia Prussia Austria Sweden
and other countries collectively attacked Napoleon
in the Battle of Leipzig
dealing a significant blow to France
This led to Napoleons exile  to the island of Elba in 1814
However in 1815 he made a dramatic comeback
rallying his soldiers and marching towards Paris
Despite briefly reclaiming the throne with public support
his rule lasted only three months
The United Kingdom and its allies
waged another war against Napoleon
culminating in the Battle of Waterloo  the final battle of Napoleon
Following this defeat Napoleon was  exiled to the remote island of St Helena
where he passed away six years later
in 1821
marking the end of Napoleons remarkable story

13th January 2012
715 PM
The worlds largest Italian cruise ship
set sail for its 7day European tour
This ship was named the Costa Concordia
It was so big that
not only was it bigger than the Titanic
but it could seat an additional 2000 passengers
Thats why 4252 people are on board
If we talk about entertainment
this ship had everything!
4 big swimming pools 5 restaurants
13 different bars a casino
a basketball court a huge fitness centre
which had a gym a sauna a Turkish bath
and even an F1 racing simulator  was installed on this cruise ship
The first destination of this ship  was Savona a city in Italy
it was supposed to take about a day to reach there
But only 25 hours after the ship departed
everyone heard a sudden piercing noise
After that all the lights on the ship went off
And the ship started tilting towards one side
The time was 945 PM
A time when some people were sleeping in their rooms
and some were eating at the dinner tables
Some people who were sleeping woke up
and they came out of their cabins  to see what was happening
Meanwhile the plates of the  people sitting at the dinner table
started sliding down the side of the table
Passengers were told via intercom that
there was an electrical failure on the ship
But the fact was that
the engine of the ship had failed
The captain of the ship was hiding this fact from the people
After a while the ship started tilting to the other side
By then the passengers somewhat realised that
this was not an ordinary electrical failure
People were worried that this was  another incident similar to Titanics
Coincidentally the Titanic accident happened exactly 100 years ago
in 1912
And now when this ship had an electrical failure
the famous Titanic theme song  was playing in the dining hall of this ship
My Heart Will Go On
Slowly the ship started tilting more
It tilted to the right side
and the lower rooms were being filled with water
By then people had realized that  the ship was going to sink
But why were the passengers not being informed properly?
Why was the ships captain so quiet?
This ship was operated by an  Italian company called Costa Crociere
Initially this company operated only cargo ships
But in 1948 they launched their Costa lines
Soon after it became one of the  biggest cruise ship companies in Europe
Later in 2000 a company named  Carnival Corporation bought it
So Costa Croisiere became  a subsidiary company of Carnival
In June 2006 they launched their first ship
of the Concordia class
The Costa Concordia that were talking about today
The biggest Italian cruise ship of its time
The cost of making it was 570 million
25 billion at that time
That day the captain of this ship was
Francesco Schettino an Italian man
who had been working for this company since 2002
Remember his name
because he plays an important role in our story
At 718 PM this ship left for its first destination Savona
And only two hours had passed that
this ship deviated from its normal route
It was not a mistake
Captain Schettino wanted to  take the ship by a particular island
The Giglio Island in Italy
He wanted the people of the island
to see the glittering ship in the dark of night
Whenever a ship passes near the land
it is called a sail past or sail by
Normally such big ships sail  at a distance of 78 km from the shore
well into the sea
because the water needs to be  deep enough for such a big ship to sail
But because of this sailby
this ship was only 150 m away from the shore
Obviously the water was not very deep
There can be big rocks or reefs  under the ship at this close distance
which can hit the ship
On top of that it was nighttime
and the ship was sailing quite fast
Later the report of the Italian Ministry of  Infrastructure and Transport confirmed this
At night the ship was sailing at an unsafe  distance very close to the shore
One question that will arise here is
why was the captain doing this?
The thing is Captain Schettino
used to work under Senior Captain Mario Palombo
And Mario was living on the Giglio Island
The night this ship was passing by this island
that night Captain Schettino
called Mario and told him that
since they would be passing by the island
they would sound a siren for him
as they wanted to give him a tribute
To this Mario said that
he was not on the island
instead he was in another Italian city
During this conversation the call line gets disconnected
This call was made at 940 PM
And a few minutes later
came the scary sound that I mentioned  at the beginning of the video
The thing everyone feared happened
This ship collided with the rocks in the water
This collision tore the hull of the Concordia ship
The ships sensitive part was injured by a 70meterlong wound
The place where this impact happened
was not even 100 meters away from the island
In the darkness of the night this ship
had reached so close to the island
Water started flowing into the ship rapidly
26yearold Andrea Corollo who was the third officer of the Concordia ship
was sleeping in his cabin when this incident happened
When he woke up and came out of his cabin
he saw that the water had already reached the hallway
He immediately ran to the engine room
When he reach there
he saw that the door could not be opened
Through the closed door
he could see that the generators and engines
were completely submerged in water
At 952 PM
the chief engineer and the other officers of the engine room
tried to start the emergency diesel generator
Unfortunately they failed in this attempt
The chief engineer went to inform Captain Chettino
about how bad the situation was
But the captain of the ship  announced to the passengers that
there was nothing to worry about
That it was a simple blackout
Over the next few minutes the ship was not standing still
rather it was moving forward
away from the island
At around 10 PM
Captain Schettino felt that
the ship should be turned around
He reasoned that if they sank it would be  more dangerous to be in the middle of the sea
It would be better to stay near the island
The ship took a Uturn
and thus instead of being upright
it started tilting to the other side
First it was tilting to the left
now it started tilting to the right
The ships crisis coordinator Roberto Ferrarini
called Captain Schettino twice
at 1005 PM and 1007 PM
In the second call Captain Schettino finally acknowledged that
the ship had some problems
But had he admitted these problems sooner
it would have been better
Turning away from the truth can be very dangerous
as you will see later in the story
And this applies to our lives too

He claimed that the blackout
caused the accident
He reverses the timeline
In reality the accident caused the blackout
In the meanwhile some distressed  passengers tried to call the local police
At 1012 PM
the Italian coast guard called the ships captain
Asking him what was happening on the ship
And informing him that passengers of the ship were contacting them
On the other hand the captain said  that nothing devastating had happened
they simply had a blackout
He told them not to worry
When this was said
half an hour had already passed since the collision
Ten more minutes pass
and Captain Schettinos finally changed his stance
After all how long could he suppress the truth with lies?
At 1022 PM
Schettino told the radio operator
to call and inform the coast guard
that there had been a collision on the left side of the ship
and that Concordia needed the help of tugboats
And that life jackets were handed out  to the passengers and everyone was safe
Each minute was important here
because the ship was gradually tilting more and more
Finally at 1033 AM
a general emergency alarm was raised
and the passengers were told
to gather in the emergency assembly areas
and wait for further instructions
At 1048 PM
the ship was tilted 30
More than an hour had passed since the accident
At 1054 PM
finally Captain Schettino gave orders
to abandon the ship
Think about it friends
More than 4200 people were stuck on this ship
And this ship was tilted by 30
Many of the lower cabins were submerged in the water
and things were strewn about in the upper decks
nothing was in its place
In this situation the captain had made only one reasonable decision
To take a Uturn
Now based on this one good decision
the lying egoistic Captain was trying to garner support
and wanted people to see him as a hero because of this decision
Undoubtedly this decision was needed
But the rest of his decisions were unreasonable
and entirely wrong decisions
On top of that he was piling up his lies
and misguiding passengers on this sinking ship
Later on our captain did something
after which he was thoroughly criticised by the people
As soon as he gave the order to abandon the ship
there was a huge commotion in Concordia
Some people had already fled using  lifeboats before this announcement
Some of the others were confident that they could swim
so they jumped into the water
They swam to the island nearby
But after the signal by the captain chaos ensued
The mob of passengers ran towards the lifeboats
People pushed and shoved one another to get to the lifeboats
One good thing was that
fed up by Captain Schettinos behaviour
some of the crew members
were already rebelling against the captain
Ten to fifteen minutes before his order
the passengers were taken out of their cabins
and put into the lifeboats
A steward came over to us
because the key card wasnt working
And told us  Take your coat take your life jacket
In the darkness of the night the ship was slowly falling to the right
A 40 tilt a 50 tilt
By this point the passengers whose cabins were on the right side
had reached the surface level of the sea
So they could easily jump into the water  and head towards the island
But the problem was for those
who were on the other side of the ship
In a tilted ship
how could they find the way out?
In the midst of all this an Indian staff member was also present
Karnaatha Rameshana
the only woman in the 11member security staff of Concordia
She later stated how language barriers started to emerge
Most of the passengers on the cruise ship were Italian
but many of the crew members did not know Italian
On top of that another problem was that
most of the crew members were not trained for such emergency situations
They were just service staff
Despite all these problems
some crew members were truly heroes
Karnaatha personally seated a blind woman on a lifeboat
Two other members lifted wheelchairbound passengers on their shoulders
and seated them on the lifeboats
That night another Indian crew member was present on the ship
Russell Rebello
he was working as a waiter
Before Captain Schettinos order
he was helping the passengers to get on the lifeboats
He kept helping passengers on the sinking ship till the last moment
but unfortunately Russel was among those
who couldnt save themselves
during this evacuation
We dont know what happened to him exactly
but he drowned while helping the passengers
this we know for sure
Indian waiter Russel Rebello is said to
have d!ed after giving up his own lifejacket
to save one passenger
and helping others into lifeboats
On the other hand there were people like Captain Schettino
who instead of helping the passengers
abandoned the ship at the earliest
and went towards the island
Italian cruise ship captain
apparently ran for lifeboat
and got off the wreck
while his crew and passengers
were still on board fighting for their lives
Yup you heard that right
The same captain who tried to cover it up with lies
Wasted an hour before telling the truth to the passengers
And as soon as he made the announcement
within some minutes at 1119 PM
he was among the first crew members
Giglio island is like a small village
Not many people live there
This island has a population of only 700 people
But that night when the incident happened
some people came out of their homes to see what was happening
As soon as the deputy mayor of this island Mario Pellegrini came to know that
a ship was sinking
despite being a civilian he went to the ship to help the people
Without thinking for a minute
he jumped into the lifeboat
and went into the sea to help the people
He said that when the ship had completely fallen to the right side
wells of water were being formed inside the ship
people were trapped in these
He arranged for a rope
and used the rope to rescue the people trapped in the well
In this early stage of evacuation
around 2500 to 3300 people had safely reached the island
At 1138 PM
around 400 people were still trapped in the ship
The Italian Coast Guard helicopters and fire and rescue services boats
had also arrived to help people
They saved a few hundred people from underwater
but they didnt know how many more people were still trapped in the ship
At 1242 AM
the Coast Guard commander Captain Gregorio De Falco
called Captain Schettino
we have the actual recording of this call
In his anger he told Schettino directly
that as the captain he should go back on the ship
He ordered Schettino to go back
and find out about the passengers still on board
He told Schettino that he shouldnt have left his passengers and ran away
Schettino started making excuses
and saying that he couldnt go back
Despite all of this Captain Schettino did not go back
This is why people started calling him Captain Coward later
On one hand some brave crew members  and the Italian Coast Guard team
kept helping people all night
Schettino sat at a safe distance and watched it play out
When the sun rose the next morning  and the ship could be seen properly
people realised the magnitude of the incident
Look at these photos taken in the morning
Exactly where this collision happened
you can see that part too
The sheer size of the collision
Most of the people had been rescued by morning
Three people had been confirmed d3ad
but some people were still trapped in the ship
Meanwhile the residents of Giglio had found out about this incident
and many locals went to help
700 people were living on the island
but there were 4000 people on the ship
The residents opened their homes  to provide shelter to the passengers
Elizabeth Nani who worked in Giglio Tourist Information
reported that all the survivors were in shock
Some people were suffering from hypothermia
because the water was very cold
But everyone was desperate
and was trying to locate their family members and friends
Schools churches and canteens on this island were opened
so that the survivors could get a roof over their heads
They were also given blankets and dry clothes
But on the other hand the rescue operation was still going on
It would last for the next 225 weeks
The Italian Navy Coast Guard Fire and Rescue Service
everyone had to get involved
Rescue divers were also needed
because the people who were still trapped  were not able to open the cabin doors
The water pressure on the other side was so high that
they remained trapped inside the cabin
On 14th January a South Korean couple was rescued
who were trapped inside their cabin like this
Most of the people who were k!lled in this incident
d!ed because of this
Trapped inside their cabin
they drowned
Had they been informed on time
their lives could also have been saved
A total of 32 people d!ed in this accident
The next problem was to remove fuel from the sunken ship
and to rescue the ship  so that it would not remain lying there
When the engineers analyzed the ship
it was declared a constructive total loss
This meant that there was no chance of saving it
This ship could not be used again
The only option was to disassemble it
and sell its scrap metal
First of all the ship contained around 19 million litres of fuel
It was a fully loaded ship
It had just started sailing
Thats why the fuel tank was full
To extract fuel an oil barrier was built around the ship
On 12 February 2012 the oil removal process began
Since it was wintertime
another problem was that
a lot of fuel was in a semisolid state
So it was necessary to reheat it
before extracting it
After heating it another tanker ship was used
and all the oil was transferred from  one vessel to the other with a pump
This process lasted more than a month
This process continued till 24th March
Now the next thing was to  set the ship upright
and to relocate it was an engineering project
A steel structure was built in the water
so that the ship could be raised once again
Work on this started a year later in April 2013
After this huge boxes were placed on the upper side of the ship
Water was filled in these boxes
to make them heavier
Ropes and cables were then used
to pull these boxes as weights
These watertight boxes are called caissons
15 such caissons were installed in total
On 16th September 2013
the actual process of straightening the Concordia began
It took 19 hours to do this
You can see how this was done
By using pulling machines steel structures and caissons
The next step was to make the ship float on water
For this more boxes were used
Caissons were installed on the other side as well
after that water was drained out from the caissons
which caused the caissons to float
And as the caissons started floating
the entire ship started floating with them
A sound usually used to warn
bled out to shout success
500 divers technicians engineers and  biologists were involved in this process
19 months had passed since the accident
and the cost of rescuing this ship alone
was 799 million
To take this ship to the port another ship was used to tow it
This was done in July 2014
Till then the total cost of this operation
had reached 12 billion
But the company still had more such expenses to bear
It took a lot of effort and money  to scrap metal from this broken ship
More than 350 people worked on this
and this process ended in July 2017
But after rescuing people
a steady stream of legal cases had begun
Finally this company returned the price of each surviving passengers ticket
and paid an additional 11000 as compensation
This is around 1 million per passenger
Apart from this the families of the deceased passengers
were paid an undisclosed amount
The total cost of this disaster for this company
was 2 billion
what happened to the captain of the ship?
The guy who was the sole reason behind this incident
lied to his passengers
and didnt give them timely information
and when the ship started sinking
he abandoned the ship first and ran away
Even after the incident
Captain Schettinos habit of lying didnt go away
When the case was being tried in court
he told the court that
when the ship was at an angle of 6070
his foot slipped and he fell into a lifeboat
And he apparently fell in a peculiar way that
he was shipped off
Obviously no one found this argument believable
The judge did not believe this at all
In 2017 Captain Schettino was charged with manslaughter
and he was sentenced to 16 years in jail
Moving forward some more interesting  facts about Schettino were revealed
Mario Palombo whom I had  talked about at the beginning of the video
who was the senior captain
in 2003 Schettino worked under him
Palombo revealed that Schettino had always been a liar
He said that in many cases instead of admitting his mistakes
Schettino preferred to lie
That night it was a matter of chance that
there was another ships captain was onboard the Concordia
Roberto Bosio
He was the captain of the Costa Serena
but that night he was on Concordia
But unlike Schettino
he didnt flee the ship
He kept helping people till the end
And in fact even before Schettinos official announcement
he had already started evacuating the people
Later he said
Only a disgraceful man would have  left all those passengers on board
It was the most horrible experience of my life
a tragedy a heartache that I will always carry with me forever
Dont call me a hero
I just did my duty
A captains duty
Actually this should be the duty of all humans
Along with the captain 5 people were arrested
Especially the highranking officers on the ship that night
Each of them was sentenced to 2 years
Because the biggest mistake was made by Captain Schettino
Today 11 years after this incident
Schettino is serving his sentence in jail
And if you learn anything from this story it is this
Never give the captaincy of your ship
to a lying coward
who doesnt know how to admit his mistakes
Leaders who never admit to their mistakes
and lie to hide their mistakes
can be extremely dangerous

about the Andes disaster
Its been two weeks since the IsraelPalestine war started
And now the situation in Gaza is no less than h3ll
Since 9th October
Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza
This means food supply of medicines
water and even electricity
has been cut off by Israel in Gaza
On top of that the continuous bombardment is unimaginable
The scenes coming out of Gaza are shocking
Look at this footage
Entire neighbourhoods have been reduced to rubble
These were the Gazan buildings that were targeted by Israel
Estimates show that
more than 2800 Palestinian civilians have been klld
Thousands are still trapped in this debris
The ones who are still alive are trying to get shelter in hospitals and schools
But by 16th October
water was also running out in the  United Nations shelters too
The United Nations agency UNRWA said on 15th October that
they are witnessing an unprecedented human catastrophe in Gaza
Mehmood Matar a surgeon working in Gaza
told BBC that hospitals are completely overwhelmed
There is no water no electricity
and the network connection is also unstable
He said that he was looking for water
Another doctor working at Naseer Hospital in Gaza said that
fuel is also going to run out
There are 60 patients on dialysis
35 patients are in ICU
they need ventilators
If fuel runs out it will not be possible to save them
And this isnt in only one hospital
Its the same everywhere
On 17th October health officials said that
the only oncology hospital in Gaza
would be shut down within 48 hours
if the situation continues like this
And all cancer patients
will be left without critical care
Take a look at the map of Gaza friends
It is a small place
This strip is spread over just 365 km
If you compare it with the size of New York
you will realize how small it is
Even if you compare it with Delhi
it is almost 14th of the size of Delhi
In this small area 23 million people live
This is one of the most densely populated places in the world
Even before the war began
the living conditions here were very bad
The people who lived here
were constantly under Israeli surveillance
and could not even travel beyond Gaza without Israels permission
It is also important to mention that
out of the 23 million population
almost half of the population are children
This is the reason why according to the estimates
out of all the people klld in this war
60 of them were the women and children living in Gaza
But the situation was so bad even before the war began that
those criticising Israel called Gaza an openair prison
As if the place is an open jail
On 7th October Hams attacked Israel
which started this war
But in response
Israel is continuously attacking Gaza
By putting a total blockade on Gaza
due to which not only Hams members are being klld
but also Palestinian civilians
And now Gaza has turned into hll
People say that
dolling out collective punishment like this to the people of Gaza
Israels action is no less than trrrism
The Norwegian Foreign Minister said that
it is unacceptable to impose a total blockade
At least humanitarian aid such as medicine and food should be allowed in Gaza
United Nations SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres had a similar opinion
Israel should allow humanitarian aid in Gaza
and Hams should release Israeli hostages without any conditions
Imagine in such circumstances
if you were a common person living in Gaza
what would you have gone through?
You dont have electricity water
internet connection is cutoff
you cant get food from anywhere
And then one day
you suddenly see some pamphlets falling from the sky
On those pamphlets there is a warning from Israel
In the warning it is written that
all the people living in the north of the Gaza Strip
should evacuate and
go to the south of the Gaza Strip
You can hear the sound of bombardment all around
And now you are being warned
to vacate your house as soon as possible
and go to the south if you want to survive
According to the estimates
about 11 million people live in Northern Gaza
The IDF warned everyone
to evacuate and go to the South
The shelters of the United Nations in Northern Gaza
were no longer safe
Anyone could be targeted in Northern Gaza
the hospitals schools or even clinics
The UNRWA pointed out
that many pregnant women children and elderly people
would not be able to move
Where will they go?
How will they evacuate?
On top of that the World Health Organization
strongly condemned Israels orders
There are 22 hospitals in northern Gaza
which have more than 2000 patients
How will hospitals be evacuated?
Despite this the Israeli military said that
around 600000 Gazans
evacuated from the northern area to the south
500000 people did not evacuate
but lets assume that you were among those who evacuated to the south
But does this mean you will be safe from the bombings?
Our people that were klld or injured
during these aerial strikes
in their homes in Deir al Balah
which is located in Southern Gaza
We witnessed instances
of airstrikes in Central Gaza
where the homes of many families were destroyed
People living in Southern Gaza arent safe either
Khan Yunis a city in Southern Gaza had to suffer through multiple airstrikes
A BBC correspondent confirmed the air strike in southern Gaza
a building near the Rafah crossing was damaged indeed
According to the correspondent
Israel hit the area near the Rafah crossing point at least thrice
This area is very important
Look at this place carefully
Rafah border crossing
This is the border crossing between Gaza and Egypt
If there is no safe place in Gaza
people will obviously think of leaving Gaza
On one side there is the sea where you cannot go
On two sides there is the country of Israel where you obviously cannot go
So the only place that you can flee to
is Egypt in the south
And there is only one border crossing here
The Rafah border crossing
So what would you have done in such a situation?
To escape the bombardment
you would have tried to flee Gaza
Thousands of people tried to do this
so they gathered at the Rafah border
But Egypt is not ready to open this border
Egypt and other Arab countries say that
it is unacceptable for Palestinian refugees to go to their countries
because the Palestinians have their own country
They cannot be thrown out of their own country
In the midst of all this
the danger of the war escalating is also rising
because clashes were seen in Israel and Lebanon
North of Israel is Lebanon
where the Hzbollh militant group operates
Like the Hams group
Hzbollh is also backed by Iran
and there has already been a war between Hzbollh and Israel
in 2006 which lasted for a month

And now lets get back to the topic
What has happened now is that
in the last few days
there has been a brief rcket firing between Hzbollh and Israel
On 16th  October an antitank missile was fired from Lebanon
which fell on a town in northern Israel
and injured three people
Israel has ordered its civilians
to evacuate the area near the Lebanon border
The biggest threat here is that
Hzbollh is actually more dangerous than Hams
and more powerful
They have lakhs of rckets and missiles
which can attack anywhere in Israel
On top of that Iran has also warned Israel
that if Israel tries to do a ground invasion in Gaza
that is if it deploys its army to Gaza on the ground
it can get a response from other places
It should also be noted here that
around 900 Indian troops
are stationed at the IsraelLebanon border
They are a part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
Our Indian troops have been stationed there since 1978
On 15th October it was reported that
a rcket shell fell near the site in southern Lebanon
Thankfully no casualties were reported
It is still a big mystery
how could Hams collect more than 5000 rckets in Gaza
and how was Israel completely unaware of it?
In the last video I said that
Egypt had already warned Israel that
an attack was imminent
Later it was found that
America also had information about it
and they also warned Israel too
There was an update on 28th September
by multiple streams of intelligence that
Hams can launch rcket attacks across the border
On 6th October one day before the attack
American officials circulated a report
that Hams was showing unusual activity
And an attack could happen at anytime
A Middle Eastern diplomat in Washington DC told CNN
that his government
was repeatedly warning the White House and thw US intelligence officials
that there was a buildup of weapons by Hams
He also said that
they have so many weapons in Gaza
that it was beyond anybodys imagination
So obviously the question arises
did the Israeli government already know about this attack
and they did nothing?
Here take a look at Israels internal politics as well
I had talked about this in this video
For the past few years
Israels politics has been quite unstable
Many elections were held
and the current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
has been charged with fraud
breach of trust and
taking bribery in three different scandals
Allegations are that billionaires have given him money
He denies this
but a corruption trial is going on
against Netanyahu which include
Cases 1000 2000 and 4000
These trials are pending
I told you in this video
how Prime Minister Netanyahu
is trying to interfere with the judiciary
He is trying to change this process
of how judges are selected
Citizens in Israel were out on the streets
there were nationwide protests in Israel a while back
Here you might recall the same lines of Rahat Indori
Is there a lot of tension at the borders?
Find out if the election is around the corner
Since the start of this war
Netanyahu has used emergency powers
to keep his position secure
Had this war not happened
and the corruption trial against him went on as scheduled
would he have had to resign from his Prime Ministerial position?
Thats another important question
Apart from this another allegation that is being put on Netanyahu is that
he tried to encourage the Hams group in the past
On one hand there was the great Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
whom I talked about in the video on IsraelPalestine history
He tried unrelentingly to bring peace between Israel and Palestine
The peace process was almost over
when a fanatic shot him
On the other hand what did Netanyahu do?
He leads a rightwing government
with the chestthumping approach
He divided the power between Gaza Strip and West Bank
He ignored the legitimate Palestinian Authority and President
And Hams a trrrist organisation
he tried to negotiate with them indirectly through Egypt
Look at this article in The Telegraph
How Benjamin Netanyahu empowered Hams
and broke Israel
This 18th October article
from the Times of Israel
For years Netanyahu propped up Hams
Now its blown up in our faces
It states that according to several reports
Netanyahu had said that
they should facilitate transfer funds to Gaza
so that there can be a separation
between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank
and Hams in Gaza
He said that this gap would ensure
that a Palestinian state will never be formed
An extreme rightwing politician from his political party
had made a statement in 2015
that Israels policy is to treat the Palestinian Authority as a burden
and treat Hams as an asset
The Israeli government allowed
suitcases with millions of dollars from Qatar to enter Gaza
to benefit Hams in 2018
These may seem shocking to you
but the majority of the Israeli public already knows about these things
Because thankfully the Israeli media
is still free
It does not sit in their governments lap
This is the reason why according to the latest polls
the approval rating of Netanyahu has been falling rapidly
since the war started
According to a recent poll
only 29 of the Israelis
support Netanyahu now
This has reached an alltime low
Israel is now witnessing protests
against Netanyahus government
People are venting their anger on Netanyahu
With placards in their hands
Bibi you have bl00d on your hands
Go to jail Bibi
In another incident an angry mob
shouted at the Israeli Cabinet Minister
outside a hospital
And the minister had to go back
That person said
now its time for them to take control
Them as in Israeli civilians
Thats why I say
never have blind faith in any government organization or group
Always take the side of humanity
and think about the common people
Whether they are the common people living in Israel
or the common people living in Gaza
Now you can click here to watch the video on the Israel protests
from a few months ago
when Netanyahu tried to take over the judiciary
On 21st August 1911
it was a Monday morning in the French capital Paris
It was quite bustling
People were going to work in their offices
when suddenly three men came out of the Louvre museum
The three had spent the previous night in the museum
And now they were carrying an  important property of the Louvre Museum
that was hidden in a blanket
while they tried to escape
They went to a nearby railway station
and caught the train at 845 in the morning
and disappeared
The whole world was unaware of the fact that
they had stolen a painting
Not an insignificant painting
The worlds most famous painting
The Mona Lisa
Today the value of this painting
is close to 1 billion
What are the secrets hidden in the Mona Lisa?
Why is this the most famous painting in the world?
Lets understand the mystery of the Mona Lisa
Mona Lisa was painted in 1503
by an Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci
And this man was so amazing
that you wont even believe it
Not only was he a painter
but also an engineer scientist
sculptor architect and theorist
He had knowledge of so many subjects
be it painting cartography
astronomy anatomy
botany hydrology
geology optics or even palaeontology
An entire video can be made on his life
So without talking about him too much
lets get to Mona Lisa
Which was his most famous painting
But who was this person in the painting?
People have always been curious about  the identity of the woman in the painting
The first revelation about this was made by
an Italian artist named Giorgio Vasari
who wrote the autobiography  of Leonardo da Vinci in 1550
According to Vasari this woman was
Lisa Gherardini
She was married to a silk trader who lived in Florence
Francesco Giocondo
He believed that Francesco had  commissioned this painting of his wife
and thats the origin of the names of this painting
The first name that we all know
Mona Lisa
derived from Madonna Lisa
Traditionally in Italian
the word Madonna was used to mean Madam
So Madonna Lisa meant Madam Lisa
The word Madonna was later shortened to Monna
Monna with a double N
When this was written in English
an N was dropped
and Monna became Mona
So Mona Lisa means
Madam Lisa or Lady Lisa
And then comes Mona Lisas other name
which is La Gioconda
After her marriage Lisa Gherardini
became Lisa Giocondo
Interestingly in Italian Giocondo means
lighthearted or cheerful
Meaning bright and joyful
And today Mona Lisa is very famous for her smile
So thats where it got its name
La Giocondo
In French the word Giocondo is written with a J
like this Joconde
So thats why when you go to the Louvre Museum in Paris
and see the painting of Mona Lisa
in French it would be identified as La Joconde
Now the interesting thing is that
in 1550 despite this revelation
people were not ready to believe that
Vasaris narrative was correct
Many theories started to emerge
about this woman being someone else
Some people said that she  was Leonardo da Vincis mother
Some said that this was a painting  of a queen from the Italian aristocracy
The most interesting theory was that
in this painting da Vinci painted himself
That this painting is not of a woman
but in fact a selfportrait of Da Vinci
Where he imagined
how he would have looked had he been a woman
This theory was promoted by  artist Lilian Schwartz in an article in 1987
She used digital tools to
try to show similarities between
Leonardo Da Vincis face
and Mona Lisas image
With this logic any two faces
can be seen as similar by placing them on top of each other
But today we can say with a lot of certainty that
the woman painted here
is indeed Lisa Giocondo
A professor living in Florence
researched this for 25 years
and found the archives
and in 2004 he discovered clear evidence
to prove this fact
He also found that
the da Vinci family had a close relationship
with Francesco Giocondos family
He also found a record that
Lisas marriage was registered on 5th March 1495
when Lisa was 16 years old
and Francesco was around 30 years old
He found that Leonardo da Vincis father
and Lisas husband knew each other very well
And its possible that
this painting was commissioned not by Lisas husband
but by Leonardos father
Pallanti says that
when the Mona Lisa was painted
Lisa was 24 years old
And that there might have been  two reasons for painting this
The first reason is that in 1503
when Francesco and Lisa bought their home
or the second reason is that
in December 1502
when their second son was born
The second reason seems more probable
because three years before this in 1499
Lisa lost her daughter
If you look at this painting closely
you will see a veil over Lisas hair
Many people call it a mourning veil
It is a veil that is worn when
someone in the family has passed away
Now one question arises here
if Da Vinci was Italian
Mona Lisa was Italian
then why is this painting in France today?
Well the thing about this is that
in the year 1516
the king of France King Francis I
invited Leonardo da Vinci to live in France
And so da Vinci moved from Italy to France
And took with him the Mona Lisa
Historical records arent clear about this
but its believed that da Vinci  hadnt completed the painting yet
15 years after starting the painting
he was still working on this painting
trying to modify it and make it better
Meanwhile in the year 1519
Leonardo da Vinci passed away during his stay in the French palace
And the king kept this painting  as a part of his Royal Collection
About 150 years in 1797
when the French Revolution happened
this painting was taken out of the palace
and handed over to the Louvre Museum
in case you havent seen it yet
its link is in the description
The interesting thing is that
this is the reason why
the Mona Lisa was stolen in 1911
I had talked about this at the beginning of the video
The mastermind of this theft was Vincenzo Peruggia
He stole this painting together with his two friends
He was an Italian Nationalist
He believed that this painting belonged to Italy
Not in France
And so after stealing it they took it to Italy
Stealing such a famous painting was a risky job
especially when the value of  the painting was in millions of dollars
So obviously Vincenzo wouldnt have felt safe after this theft
But if you want to feel safe and secure about your money

Now lets get back to Vincenzo
the Italian nationalist
We will talk about what happens next later in the video
But before that lets know the speciality of this painting
Why is it so special?
First of all
the Mona Lisa was not painted on paper canvas or cloth
Instead it was painted on poplar wood
In those days it was the favourite wood of Italian painters
Secondly this painting isnt large
Look at the photos
This is where it hangs in the museum
You can see its size in comparison to the people
This painting is only 77 cm by 53 cm
But still it is considered so special
because in its time in Italy
this was the first painting
which focused so closely on the person
This is a halflength portrait
These types of shots are very common in photography today
But no one used to make such paintings in those days
If you look at the overall colour grading of this painting
you will see a lot of brown and yellow shades    It looks like a very dull painting It is so yellowish that at one point a professor declared Lisa a cholesterol patient But there are two reasons behind this First a varnish layer has been applied to this painting so that moisture does not affect the painting badly
It looks like a dull painting
It is so yellowish that once a professor
had declared Lisa to be a patient with high cholesterol
But there are two reasons for this
First there is a layer of varnish on top of this painting
So that there are no illeffects of moisture on this painting
since it was painted on wood
So its necessary to protect it from humidity and moisture
And secondly
over time there was bleaching
Originally when this was painted
it used to be more bright and colourful
Some people tried to recreate this painting
to see how it would have looked originally
Da Vinci used a very special painting style in this painting
known as Sfumato
The technique of blending
The background you see in this painting
is a landscape
It is the Arno Valley in Italy
There are no clear boundaries or outlines  between the background and Mona Lisa
In some places Mona Lisas hair is blended with the landscape
Blurring the outlines and blending the colours
is the technique of Sfumato
This is the secret behind Mona Lisas mysterious smile
Look at Mona Lisas smile carefully
The more you look at this smile
the more serious this face will look
But now look into Mona Lisas eyes
Suddenly you will see Lisa smiling more
If you look at any part of the painting
be it the background Mona Lisas forehead or her eyes
you will see the effect
Lisas face starts smiling more
when you dont focus on the smile
To perfect this smile
da Vinci spent the most time
He spent many nights in a hospital in Florence
where he used to go and remove the skin of d3ad bodies
He wanted to study the facial muscles and nerves
and how they work together to create a smile
He wrote in his book that
the muscles which move the lips
are more numerous in man
than in any other animal
It was very difficult for him to dissect the muscles of the lips
because the muscles here are tiny and numerous
During this experiment
da Vinci studied horses as well
He compared human expressions to that of horses
In the notes he wrote
Notice whether the muscle that
raises the nostrils of the horse
is the same as that which
lies here in man
Hardly throughout history any other artist
has dissected the faces of a horse and a human
and done these experiments
His obsession with Mona Lisas smile
didnt end here
After this he did research on optics as well
He found that the light rays
dont merge together into a single point on our eyes
rather they spread out over the entire retina
The centre of the retina
known as the Fovea
helps us see the finest details
On the other hand the rest of the retina
picks up shadows and blackandwhite imagery more
Using this knowledge
he focused on the shadows in such a way that
even when you see the Mona Lisa in your peripheral vision
as in if you are looking this way  and Mona Lisa is on the other side
even if you are not paying attention to Mona Lisa
the effect of her smile is still there
When you look at her smile closely
you will see that its central line is a flat line
is why when you look at her smile
it looks like she is not smiling at all
But on the other hand  the shadows created using the Sfumato technique
have such an effect that
when you look elsewhere
your peripheral vision sees that smile
and its shadows are reflected
And then you feel that Lisa is smiling
How would it feel if I told you that
the Mona Lisa is not one painting
rather two paintings
This is not a conspiracy theory
its the truth
Mona Lisas painting as we know
a similar painting was created
at the same time
The story of this second Mona Lisa began
in the year 1504
when another legendary artist named Raphael
made a rough sketch using pen and ink
This sketch looked something like this
and if you compare it with the Mona Lisa in Louvre
you can see a huge difference
In this sketch by Raphael
you can see two columns behind Mona Lisa
Here the researchers believed that
Raphael must have made his drawing based on the Mona Lisa painting
So it was initially brushed off
But this theory was disproved by  a German art historian in 1993
And Professor Pallanti whom I had mentioned earlier
who had been researching the identity of the Mona Lisa for 25 years
confirmed that Raphael actually
lived right in front of the Giocondo family in Florence
So does this mean that Raphael
made an original painting
on the same subject
with the same woman in the same pose?
This seems quite unbelievable
Another answer to this question could be that
another Mona Lisa painting exists
which inspired Raphael to make this drawing
And this second Mona Lisa painting was revealed to the world
in 1914
A novelist living near London
John R Eyer
had a new version of the Mona Lisa
This is the new Mona Lisa painting
The same painting based on which
Raphael made his drawing
This second Mona Lisa
is 35 inches longer
and 5 inches wider than the one in the Louvre
If you compare these two paintings
you will notice three things
First the woman in this new Mona Lisa
looks much younger
Second the head in this new painting
is tilted a little forward
And third the expressions of this new Mona Lisa
are very straightforward and clear
There is nothing mysterious about her smile
that is in the Mona Lisa in Louvre
The two columns in the background
are the ones seen in Raphaels drawing
Due to these reasons
a new theory is coined by the experts
That Leonardo da Vinci was actually working on two Mona Lisas
Leonardo da Vinci painted both these Mona Lisa
But the Isleworth Mona Lisa that was later discovered
was the first version of da Vincis painting
He was experimenting with his style then
And this is why the Mona Lisa in that painting
looks younger than the other Mona Lisa
This theory remains a topic of debate to date
In 2010 the Mona Lisa Foundation
started an investigation on the Isleworth Mona Lisa
to find out the secret behind it
And they came up with another theory
They said that the face and hands of this new Mona Lisa
were indeed painted by da Vinci
But the background was painted by an inferior artist
Perhaps a person working in Leonardos workshop
had finished this painting
Both these theories remain mere theories
because no solid evidence has been found on either side
Coming back to the theft of the Mona Lisa
it was found that the mastermind of this theft Vincenzo Peruggia
was an employee in the Louvre Museum
One day he hid in some corner in the museum
and spent the night there
after which the next morning he walked out with the painting
He believed that since Leonardo da Vinci was an Italian
this painting should be in an Italian museum
When the news of the theft spread
it made headlines all over the world
Scores of detectives were put to work
to look for the thief
But no one could find him
For two years Peruggia hid this painting at his home
He wondered what he could do with it
The whole world was looking for it
Finally he became impatient
and tried to sell the painting
He tried to sell this painting to an art dealer in Florence
To Giovanni Poggi
Giovanni became suspicious
and saw the stamp on the painting to confirm that
it was the stolen painting
He was being sold the most wanted item in the world
Because of this Vincenzo was caught
and was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment
The painting was sent back to the Louvre Museum
and was hung up on 4th January 1914
Today this painting is displayed there
behind bulletproof glass
in strict climatecontrolled conditions
where humidity is maintained at 50  10
temperature is strictly maintained at 18C to 21C
Perhaps the most interesting part in this story is that
only after this theft
did Mona Lisas popularity start increasing
And it became the worlds 1 famous painting
Before the theft the Mona Lisa was not very famous
People who were interested in art
knew about the Mona Lisa but
the common folks did not know about the Mona Lisa
So if you go to the Louvre Museum
and see the painting of the Mona Lisa
and you see a crowd of people around it
then you can blame Vincenzo for this popularity
If you liked this video you will also like the video on Kohinoor
You can click here to watch the video
where I have explained the mystery of Kohinoor
Recently I made a video on the film Animal
in which I called it a cancer for society
After watching it some people asked  What about toxic feminism?
Are feminist films not bad for society?
So come in this video lets know about
feminism and patriarchy in depth in detail
What is Feminism?
How does feminism impact our society?
And how are men suffering because of it?
Feminine gender masculine gender neutral
in Hindi it is known as Streeling and Puling
those words have now being
given a new meaning
Often on social media
whenever we talk about topics like  masculinity patriarchy and feminism
you must have heard people saying that
these girls these women or these boys are always like this
Such arguments are raised a lot
that girls are at fault in many instances
that women do this and that
Its as if a Team Boys and Team Girls are opposing each other
All the men are in one team
and women are in the other team
Think about it is it not strange?
That males and females are always divided into two different teams
Every house has a mother a daughter a sister or a wife
So while using such arguments
how can we say things like  girls are always like this
or that women are always like this
On the other hand it doesnt make sense  to group all men into one team
There are men who throw acid on girls
if she refuses them
Would you like to be in the same team with them?
The real division that exists here is
between patriarchal people and feminist people
What do these words mean?
Lets take a look at the dictionary
Patriarchy is a social system
where men have control over women
In Hindi patriarchy can be called as
Purush Pradhan Samajik Vyavastha Maledominated social structure
A system where all power is held by men
So what is the definition of Feminism?
Does Feminism mean a society
where the power is in the hands of women?
The definition of feminism is something else
Feminism is an ideology
which believes that there should be
political economic and social  equality between men and women
Women should be given equal  rights and opportunities as men
So even though the word Feminism  is derived from the word Female
it doesnt mean that
women are given more power than men
Theres another word for that Matriarchy
This is the equivalent of Patriarchy
Where men are considered superior to women in Patriarchy
in Matriarchy women are considered superior to men
But Feminism means that
there is no discrimination between the two genders
Now you must be thinking
does this mean that a man can also be a feminist?
In fact any rational and sensible man
will be a Feminist
Former US President Barack Obama once wrote an essay
in which he called himself a Feminist
When the legendary author Salman Rushdie was asked
if he was a feminist he replied
Yes what else is there to be?
Either you are a feminist or a fool
These are the only choices
When Hollywood filmmaker Darren  Aronofsky was asked the same question
he replied that it was a stupid question
Of course he is a feminist
Indian actor Rahul Bose had a similar answer to this question
He said of course he is a feminist
Anyone who believes in humanity  naturally is a feminist
Several famous male celebrities
openly call themselves Feminists
Hollywood actors Chris Hemsworth Ryan Gosling
in the Indian film industry
Farhan Akhtar Aamir Khan
Often they have talked about the issue
that men and women should be given equal rights
But the next question is
can women be patriarchal?
The answer to this is yes absolutely
There was a documentary called The World Before Her
I would like to show you a clip from it
Vishwa Hindu Parishad had organised  a Durga Vahini camp for women
The instructor was a woman
She is asking the girls
is it really necessary for them to leave their houses?
Make a career?
Is it truly necessary?
This way of thinking goes against common sense
Why would a woman choose to have inequal rights?
But the truth is
many women in our country have these patriarchal ideologies
It is all due to Social Conditioning
In this video the woman tells how
her mother slapped her in her childhood
when she saw herself in the mirror
She was told that knowing how to read and write is enough
She doesnt need higher education
There are many reasons for such  patriarchal views all over the world
Like this is our tradition
our culture
or our religion teaches us this
In society people often have strong opinions about
how an ideal woman should be
While the husband is the incarnation of God
ABP News had quoted Garud Puran in its article
that a good wife is the one who
follows her husbands orders
For a wife heaven is at her husbands feet
For any woman her familys happiness is her happiness
A woman is incomplete without becoming a mother
You must have often heard people  around you saying these things
A woman is made up of her sacrifices
If there are 4 slices of cake left
and there are 5 people
then a woman would always say that
she doesnt like cake and asks the others to go ahead
What else is commonly said?
If a girl studies more  she will get out of hand
It doesnt look good for girls to laugh loudly
A girl should be homely and wellbehaved
Such things are very common in our society
And the mass media encourages these
These socalled ideal daughterinlaw characters
in Ekta Kapoors TV serials
Always portrays regressive thinking about women
Or watch Sandeep Vangas films like  Animal or Kabir Singh
These affect our societyas
many girls want to fit into this ideal woman standard
and start accepting these views
They do this so that
they get accepted by society and their family
In psychology this phenomenon is  known as Normative Conformity
In school when teenagers often  become victims of peer pressure
its because of this phenomenon
An example of this on a smaller scale can be that
if you are sitting in a group  and someone is making a joke
Everyone starts laughing at that joke
But you dont find that joke funny
You dont want to laugh at the joke
But you choose to laugh
so that you can be a part of that group
So that you can conform to the standards of the group
Normative conformity
Many women adopt these patriarchal  ideas to gain acceptance in society
This is why throughout history
we have seen many women
who were protesting against womens equal rights
In the video on Napoleon I told you that
the leftwing revolutionaries of France at that time
were against womens rights too
They implemented the Declaration of the Rights  of Man and of the Citizen
but women were not given rights
A Jacobin politician Chaumette had said that
men have been given duties by nature
to hunt to farm to become politicians
but women have been given duties to
take care of the house and of motherhood
He called it shameless
for women to be demanding political rights for themselves
Do they want to be a man?
Many women agreed with this opinion at that time
Even 100 years later
in London in 1908
there was a woman who formed the  Womens National AntiSuffrage League
Her name was Mary and she told people
not to address her by her name
rather to address her by her husbands name
Her husbands name was Humphrey Ward
So she called herself Mrs Humphrey Ward
She was not an illiterate woman
In fact she was a bestselling novelist
She was internationally famous
She had promoted womens education in Oxford
But she was staunchly against giving women voting rights
She believed that only men can
solve constitutional legal financial  military and international problems
And then 70 years later
in 1972 which is literally only 50 years ago
America was about to pass the Equal Rights Amendment
to give equal rights to women and men
But there was a woman who opposed it
An American lawyer Phyllis Schlafly
She mobilised more women
to protest against this law
Even now where many women have  made history in different fields
women like Kalpana Chawla  have done space exploration
Women are becoming scientists
some women still hold on to patriarchal thinking
There are women who say that
feminism is useless
How can men and women be equal?
Their argument is that men  and women have different anatomies
Men cant give birth to children
So how can they be equal?
Feminism is baseless
claiming women are equal to men
there is no need to believe such stuff
Thats my opinion
We are not equal
Only the day men start getting pregnant
will we be equal
We cannot be equal
These arguments are very illogical
It is true that in male and female anatomy
23 organs may differ
But there are at least 7075 organs
that are the same in male and female anatomies
Two eyes one nose two ears
its the same for men and women
It is true that their gender is different
but its not like women belong to a different species
Both are homo sapiens
And in English two words are used here
similar and equal
To get equal rights
you dont have to be equal
being similar is good enough
Nature creates diversity
but it doesnt create discrimination
It creates differences
but not hierarchy not inequality
The diversity created by nature
is transformed into discrimination and inequality by society
Women give birth to children
so they get maternity leave
But when women work in the office
they should be paid equally to men
How is there any sort of confusion in this?
Yes men and women are not totally similar to one another
But a black man and a white man  are not totally similar to one another
A man who can walk on his two legs
and a man who is sitting in a wheelchair
are not totally similar to each other
There is a difference between a smart man and a stupid man
But equal rights are given to everyone
Because of these differences
it is not said that certain kinds  of men should not get equal rights
In every human being
there are small differences in comparison to other people
But this does not mean that
those who can walk on two legs
should be given voting rights
and those who need a wheelchair should not be
These differences cannot be the reason for not giving equal rights
So we come back to the same point
The feminist struggle
is not a men versus women scenario
rather it is about patriarchal people  versus feminist people
And this is not just a fight for equal rights for women
but also a fight for the rights of men
You heard it right Mens Rights
Patriarchy is the reason behind many mens issues
It may sound confusing
but let me explain it with an example
If I tell you friends unemployed youth
imagine a picture of a jobless person in your mind
What picture did you imagine?
You must have imagined a jobless man
You must have imagined a jobless boy
Not a girl
This is because in our society
we often see that if a girl is jobless
she can still get married
She can become a housewife
But if a boy is jobless
that becomes very problematic
The pressure of not being unemployed
is much higher for men than for women
The patriarchal ideology says that
women will work at home
and men will have to earn money
And if a woman is working and earning
then the man will have to earn more than her
Otherwise what will people say?
People will accuse him of living off of his girlfriend
They will criticise him as a man
For being a man who lives off of a womans money
That he should be ashamed
Taunting him about his wife who earns more than him
And as I told you earlier
many women and girls are victims of this patriarchal mindset
Even they say that they want a husband
who earns more than them
They will refuse an arranged marriage
if the boy does not earn more than them
And this same patriarchal mindset
is also present in mens height
Tall women like tall men
But short women also like tall men
If by chance the wifes height is more than her husbands height
then people criticise the man for being shorter than his wife
They make fun of the couple
They laugh at the man
All because of the same backward patriarchal thinking
If you are a man
suppose you are in your car with your wife or girlfriend
and a car comes and hits your car
Even though its his fault he gets  out of his car and starts shouting at you
So what would you do in such a situation?
Most people will get out of their car
and start shouting at the other person
But Gautam Buddha said
He gave me abuses I didnt take them
So the abuses remained with him
If you choose to ignore the negativity someone throws at you
the negativity will remain with them
Such thinking makes sense  only to a sensible man
But what does patriarchal thinking say?
If someone insulted you in front of your wife
and you just left after hearing it
what kind of a man are you?
You should have broken his face
You are a coward
what will your wife think about you?
And because of this patriarchal mindset
society forces that man to engage with the one insulting him
and fight with them
Will fighting solve the problem?
Not at all
Imagine that other driver is like  Ranvijay from the film Animal
A rich man who doesnt care about the law
he carries a revolver or a baseball bat with him
What will you do then?
Even in frustration youll turn around and apologise to him
Your male ego will be hurt
People will still make fun of you
As a man who was beaten up
Just for apologising
Many research papers prove that
men are more likely to get into fights than women
In 2022 the State of UK Boys report was released which showed
how violence is normalised
and it is believed that when a boy grows up
violence is a natural part of growing up
But the problem isnt limited to the violence
but also of mens loneliness
Now you must be wondering
how is this possible?
How is mens loneliness related to  feminism and patriarchy?
But there is a strong relation friends
The patriarchal mindset does not allow a man to cry
If a man cries society mocks him
for being a man who cries
Theres the saying Boys dont cry
Forget about crying
patriarchal thinking does not let men  express any negative emotion
If a boy talks to his male friends  about his problems and stress
he is considered emotionally weak
He is told that he is getting emotional like girls
In our society what are the activities  to express male friendships?
Boys like to watch movies with their male friends
play cricket or party with each other
But womens friendships are more intimate and emotional
Girls talk more openly with their friends
express their problems
But if a boy does this
society will not accept him
This is the reason why
mens loneliness becomes a separate issue
When a boy feels depressed
he is forced to hide his depression
Openly expressing any kind of grief  any kind of emotional problem
is not considered acceptable in society
So much emotional castration friends
that he is deprived of emotional intelligence
And what does this result in?
If you look at global data for people dying by su!cide
then the rate among men is much higher than that of women
Even in India according to the governments NCRB data
the rate of su!cide among men
is 25 times higher than that of women
What is the reason behind these problems?
Patriarchal thinking and patriarchy
Thats why when feminists say
Smash the Patriarchy
it doesnt mean that they are against men
Patriarchy is a way of thinking that
is destroying the lives of both men and women
When we talk about feminism in India
Kamla Bhasins name comes up a lot
7 years ago she gave this TEDx talk
in which she explained how patriarchy dehumanises men
You are not allowed to cry
Your mother passed away
But boys are not allowed to cry
Emotional castration

Apart from this these issues have been raised often internationally
Like Cassie Jayes famous TEDx talk
which has more than 10 million views
A Feminist Talking About Mens Rights
There is no denying that there are many
human rights issues
that uniquely or disproportionately affect men
Angelica Ferrara from Stanford University
wrote the book Men Without Men
This book explains how mens loneliness is a feminist issue
Taking a look at history we should  consider Raja Ram Mohan Roy a feminist
because he campaigned against Sati
And Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar
who promoted widow remarriage
Our social reformers were not against men
but wanted to give equal rights to women
And if we talk about Indian feminists
how can we forget Savitribai Phule?
Indias one of the greatest feminists
She established the first girls school  with her friend Fatima Sheikh
She had to bear so much anger from society
that people used to throw cow dung at them
She used to take a spare saree with her to school
Was Savitribai Phule against men?
In fact it was her husband Jyotirao Phule
who taught her

If we talk about history
feminism is divided into three waves
The first wave of feminism came in the 1800s and early 1900s
This was the time when women demanded to have political rights
Right to vote
Before this women did not have the right to vote
In the French Revolution a political activist Olympe de Gouges
drafted a document
the Declaration of the Rights of Women and of the Female Citizen
She is considered one of the first feminists in the world
The second wave of feminism came around the 1960s
This focused on the issue of ending gender discrimination in their households
During this time a slogan was raised by the famous feminist Carol Hanisch
The Personal is Political
Many legal and social rights were given to women
After this came the third wave of feminism
which started in the 1990s
This focused on the issues of intersectional feminism
That is feminism is not only for upperclass white women
rather poor and black women should get the same rights
But do you know what the problem is?
The boys who present themselves as alpha males on social media
they will not talk about any of these  issues while talking about feminism
They will make fun of feminism
by using these films
Wherever you see these films are compared to feminism
As if feminism means nothing else but these films
When I made a video on the film Animal
some people asked why critics always  criticise films like Animal and Kabir Singh
Why arent such films criticised?
But if you look at the critics reviews of these films
I named two film critics in the Animal video
Anupama Chopra and Sucharita Tyagi
I saw Anupama Chopras review of Four More Shorts
She said this for the first two seasons of the show
I never made it past episode 2 of Season 1 of Four More Shots Please
In her review written on her portal Film Companion
she said that this show shows a superficial form of feminism
That its a poorly written TV show
What did Sucharita have to say about Thank You For Coming?
That this is a largely unwatchable film
Thank You For Coming is a film
only masquerading as a feminist romp
While mostly being a masculine gaze
on how women probably maybe live their lives
That though the films pretends to be a feminist romp
it is presented from a masculine gaze
A person who understands feminism properly
for them it is obvious that
these films have nothing to do with feminism
Its true that film producers force words like Feminism in more and more films
but what is portrayed in the films has nothing to do with Feminism
Feminism doesnt mean that women
go out and smoke drink or objectify men
This is not feminism
Actually the real feminist films
theres no dearth of them in Bollywood
The only difference is that
the alpha men on social media
dont relate feminism to those films
Like this film Pink
This is a real feminist film
It clearly shows that
drinking doesnt equate to women empowerment
But the problem is that
when a man drinks alcohol it affects his liver
But when a woman drinks alcohol
it becomes a character certificate for her
Other than this there are films like The Great Indian Kitchen
Tumhari Sulu Queen English Vinglish
Dor Mirch Masala
These people will never talk about such films
Then there are films like Thappad
Many alpha males criticised this film saying that
the wife got a divorce just because of a slap
they said that this is not realistic
This cant be real
And no one should do this
But think about it if the story was reversed
At a party had a wife slapped her husband in front of everyone
The same people would say that it is grounds for divorce
The man should divorce her because of it
Then there is a very popular meme of Neha Dhupia
In an episode of Roadies
when she said that its her choice
Its her choice
Of course Yeah?
Nobody gives you the right to slap a girl!
When the boy did something wrong he was criticised
But in another episode when the girl did the same thing
Neha justified it and said that
its her choice
Neha was criticised a lot for this
and she was mocked
And its obvious that
what she said was a very hypocritical
Most of the alpha male incels on Instagram
show the same hypocrisy
You must have seen many of these guys showing off that
they have girls in Delhi one in Mumbai and one in Punjab
And then they use memes like
Boys will be boys men will be men
But if the girl cheats on them
then they cant tolerate it
It becomes too much for them to bear
That becomes toxic feminism
But on the other hand boys will be boys
When boys are in the wrong boys will be boys
You can see hypocrisy on both sides
And both sides are wrong
But did any feminist ever say that
what Neha Dhupia said was right?
No one said that
But again and again feminism
is tried to be equated to that statement
It is related to wrong things
There was a case in Lucknow  where a girl misbehaved with a boy
and beat him up repeatedly
It was found that the girl apparently was from a rich family
and the boy belonged to a poor family
What happened was entirely wrong
It is not right to beat anyone
But did any feminist show their support for this girl?
No one did
But still what is shown on social media repeatedly
is that this is feminism
Why do incels relate feminism to these problematic issues?
And never talks about real feminism?
The reason is very simple
They dont want equal rights for men and women
They want to promote the same patriarchal mindset
and want to discredit the entire feminist movement
These people spread lies that feminists hate all men
That feminists want women to leave men forever
But the real feminism that I talked about in the first half of this video
will never be discussed
So friends I hope this video helped you understand
the real meaning of feminism
and why Smash Patriarchy is important for boys and men
Because we want to see a world where
men and women have equal rights to be free
in terms of equal rights and opportunities
A society where
men are not pressurised into suppressing their emotions
Now if you want to understand the ideology of equality in details
how the ideas of liberty and equality were born historically
how these ideas spread all over the world
I have talked it in this video
in which I have explained the French Revolution in detail
This is one of the most searched questions on the internet
How to lose weight?
And this is probably the most popular  New Years resolution in the world
Weight loss
On this one question  millions of YouTube videos have been made
thousands of articles have been written
and so many rumours have been spread
Some tell you to eat Maggi for a muscular body
some tell you to go on a lowcarb diet
some tell you to go on a lowfat diet
some try to sell their fake products
A entire industry has been built on  weight loss
In todays video lets understand this concept in a scientific way
Whats true and whats myth?
To lose weight what should you eat and  what should you not eat?
And which diet is the best?
Lets find out
The Wonder 10day diet!
Burn away fat while you sleep!
A diet that can work when nothing else will
The popular Paleo diet
Ketogenic or Keto
Brand new South East diet
Promising new weight loss drug
Another groundbreaking weight loss drug
could soon be available in pill form
The logic behind weight loss is quite simple
Imagine that you have a bank account
All the money you earn gets accumulated in your bank account
All the money you spend  is deducted from your bank account
So if you want to increase your bank balance
you either have to increase your earnings
or reduce your expenses
Similarly our body has a calorie bank
The calories you consume accumulate here
And the more you spend  it is deducted from the stored calories
This calorie bank is our body
To store calories they are converted into fat and stored by the body
which increases our weight
So if you want to lose weight
either reduce your calorie intake or
spend more calories
To spend calories is known as Burning Calories
Lets talk about how calories burn later
before that lets know
where do calories come from?
The food you eat
whatever you drink except water
all of them have energy
in the form of calories
In nutritional science the definition of calories is that it is a unit of energy
So the food and water you are consuming that is where the calories are coming from
Since calories are a form of energy
everything for which the body uses energy
calories are burned for those
The most obvious thing that comes to peoples mind to burn calories is exercising
our body needs energy is needed for every process
so calories are burned for everything
To make your heart beat
for your lungs to breathe
to digest food in your stomach
energy is needed for all
For this reason even while sleeping at night your calories are burned
On average a normal person burns 400 calories during 8 hours of sleep
And these calories are burned merely to keep the body alive
this is known as  Basal Metabolic Rate or BMR
Every person has a different  Basal Metabolic Rate
It depends on your height weight muscle mass and many other factors
There is an online calculator through which you can calculate your BMR
For example I am 28 years old
and my height is 186 cm
and weight is 80 kg
So my BMR is 1828 calories per day
So I will burn this many calories every day without doing anything
Now apart from this I told you that eating
provides calories to the body
But do you know depending on what food you are eating your food can burn calories too?
Here comes the concept of the  Thermic Effect of Food in short TEF
The logic is very simple
when you eat food your body has to digest the food
absorb nutrients from the food
and store the food
In all these processes the body uses  energy and burns calories
So some things have a low thermal effect
Like fats oil flour and butter
Our body digests these things very easily
There is almost no need to burn any calories
On the other hand whole grains or protein rich foods
Dairy eggs highfibre vegetables and fruits
spinach broccoli  these have a high Thermic Effect
Our body has to burn a lot of calories to digest these foods
That is why it becomes difficult to gain weight by eating this type of food
Now you will wonder if this means that
some types of food may provide negative calories
The calories available in that food the body is burning more calories to consume that food
This is a myth friends
To achieve this the thermic effect of any food should be more than 100
which is impossible
This cant happen
The highest thermic effect possible is around 30
usually found in proteins
This means that if you are eating 100 calories of protein
you are spending 30 calories to digest that protein
and your body is actually gaining only 70 calories
Now there is no need to go into the math too much
I am not asking you to find out the thermic effect of every food before eating
I just wanted to give you a basic idea
so that you know that this kind of concept exists
Now lets talk about weight loss
After listening to what I said till now
people might wonder why should we exercise at all
If you consume fewer calories than your  bodys basal metabolic rate
you will lose weight automatically
Theoretically this is true but practically it is very dangerous
Eating fewer calories than your BMR  without exercising means that
your bodys hormonal balance can deteriorate
You will be more tired
You will become more irritable
It will be very difficult for you to focus on your studies and work
Do you know which body part consumes the most calories in the human body?
Our brain
Almost 20 of the energy usage of the  human body is consumed by the brain
It becomes difficult to selfcontrol for the body
Many people have this problem
where once they start eating less
they become weak
their mood is disrupted terribly
they will go on a diet for some time
but after that they will start binging
and their diet will fail
Thats why our goal should not be weight loss
but healthy weight loss
And for healthy weight loss exercise is very important
In fact four main things are very important
Diet control exercise proper sleep and keeping yourself stressfree
The last two points are quite obvious
but if you struggle with them
keeping yourself stressfree
and getting 8 hours of sleep daily
then it means that you are not managing your time properly
And in such a situation you need the right time management in your life
I made this course on time management and productivity to teach you this
The special thing is that I focus a lot on happiness in this course
Waking up at 5 am every day  and working for 12 hours a day
I am strongly against this type of hustle culture advice
Thats why my time management course will
not only increase your productivity but also your overall life satisfaction
I use the stepbystep techniques that  I teach you in this course in my life
with the help of which
I can regularly bring you these videos while travelling the world
Those who have taken the course so far have found it very lifechanging
You can see their reviews on the screen

Now lets come back to the topic
and understand diet control in detail
Have you ever had a feeling that even  though you have eaten a whole chocolate bar
but still you are feeling hungry?
After eating certain things you still dont feel full
The reason behind this is the Satiety Index
The thing is that there are some types of food
after eating which you feel full
and some types of food arent like that
In 1995 some researchers
tested 240calorie servings of 38 types of food
They found that boiled potatoes had the highest satiety index among all potato dishes
Potatoes were given a score of 323
There are some other things like pulses
highfibre foods lowfat dairy products eggs and nuts
These things also have a very high index
This means that for the same amount of calories
if you eat highsatiety food items
you will comparatively feel more full
You will feel less hungry even though the number of calories is the same
they would eat boiled potatoes throughout  the day for breakfast lunch and dinner
So they consume the least amount of calories in the day
while feeling full
Theyll go on a potatoonly diet
But again this is a wrong approach
It is alright to tweak a few things here and there
but overall the body needs a nutritious diet
Your goal here is healthy weight loss
Meaning you dont want to lose muscle
you dont want to lose your health
you just want to lose weight
There are 6 different essential nutrients
that the body needs for optimal function
Proteins carbohydrates fats  vitamins minerals and water
So when you are on a healthy weight loss diet
you will definitely need proteins vitamins minerals and water
Now the question is about  fats and carbohydrates
What about them?
Many people suggest different types  of lowfat lowcarb diets
So lets talk about carbohydrates first
Carbohydrates in short carbs what is their relation with weight loss?
The sugar that comes out of carbs is an important source of energy for the body
If our body does not use that energy immediately
the energy from the carbs is converted  into glycogen and stored
in the liver and muscles
If a person eats more carbs than his body needs
the body converts those carbs into fat cells and stores it as fat
If this energy is not used later it remains in the form of fat cells
and you gain weight
You might think that carbohydrates should be avoided
but this is the wrong conclusion
I apologize in advance for disappointing  the fans of keto or lowcarb diet
In 2017 a metaanalysis was done  of 32 controlled feeding studies
Keeping the level of protein and calories the same
they found out whether highcarb diet is better or a lowcarb diet
This research found that there is no benefit in weight loss
whether you follow a highcarb or a lowcarb diet
Weight loss ultimately works only due to Calorie Deficit
The same calorie bank balance that  I explained in the beginning
In 2012 another study was conducted in a Swedish University
to compare whether a lowfat diet is better or a lowcarb diet
This study monitored people for 2 years and ended with the same conclusion
Weight loss has nothing to do with these things
Only calories are important here
Now some people go on a highprotein diet to lose weight
Because some people have a perception that
if they eat fats or carbs they will convert into fat cells leading to weight gain
But if they eat protein only their muscles will grow bigger
It is true that protein is usually used for muscle building and muscle repairing
So if you do weight training  exercise more wrestle or such
then naturally you will need more protein
But if you sit on the sofa all day  dont move dont exercise
then the excess protein you are eating also converts into fat
Now some people will say  after watching this video that
they went on a lowcarb diet and lost weight
thinking that it works for them
But here I would like to say that
if your body is suddenly deprived of carbs
then your body loses water weight
Glycogen stores help in retaining water in our body
So if you go on a keto diet for a week you will lose 12 kgs of weight for sure
And that will be because your body has lost its water weight
As soon as you start eating carbs again that water weight will come back
Dr Sara Seidelmann and her team of researchers
did a study on 15400 people for 6 years
It was published in the famous Lancet Public Health Journal
And it studied people who are on a lowcarb diet
but are eating more animal protein
This study found that this diet can actually reduce the lifespan
When a lowcarb diet is replaced by plant protein and fat
then it will be beneficial
I have talked about this in the video of Worlds Oldest Human
what are the things that can be done to extend our lifespan
Now if we have to go lowcarb  then how low should we go?
This study found that if less than 40 of total energy is coming from carbs
or more than 70 of total energy comes from carbs
Both pose a higher risk to our health
It means that what we were taught in school
is very important here
A balanced diet
While doing a healthy weight loss you dont need to completely remove carbs from your diet
Rather you need to eat healthy carbs
Carbohydrates is the food for the brain
If you stop eating carbs your brain health may start declining
Aggression depression nervousness anxiety trepidation all these are part of it
What are healthy carbs?
Carbs that are absorbed by the body slowly
These dont raise or lower the blood sugar level
And give the body a steady source of energy
Examples of these are whole grains fruits and starchy vegetables
And now lets talk about fats
When you hear the word fat you might think that they make you fat
But this fat nutrient is also an essential nutrient
and the body needs it too
Many vitamins like vitamin A vitamin D vitamin E vitamin K are fatsoluble vitamins
so the body needs fats to absorb them
Apart from this fats are needed for hormonal balance
energy storage and to protect our vital organs
Human brains are made up of 60 fat
And this advice was given by the popular nutritionist Pooja Makhija
This trend of eating a lowfat diet  she was against it
She said that fats dont make you fat
Rather eating more fat and eating the wrong kind of fat makes you fat
So a healthy weight loss diet is a balanced diet
in which carbohydrates proteins and fats are present
The next question is what is the  optimum percentage of each of them?
What is the healthy proportion?
There is a range called Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges AMDR
According to this 4565 of your daily calories
should be from carbohydrates
2035 of calories should be from fats
1035 of calories should be from protein
The percentage you should be in this range
depends on your personal lifestyle choices
Your age
how much muscle you want to gain
are you diabetic what kind of food you prefer
For these you can consult a professional dietician
and it will be a good idea  to get a diet plan customized for you
If you do not want to consult a dietitian
then for an average person who is  not facing any health problems
it would be better to stay within this range
So the next question you will ask is how can you stay within this range?
What to eat and what not to eat?
Lets clear this point by point
What should you eat?
You should eat whole grains
Complex Carbohydrates
Other than wheat and rice
you should eat different types of grains like
corn oats barley ragi buckwheat kuttu
amaranth which is also called chaulai
or pearl millet bajra
Eat them as flatbreads roti or porridge
Apart from this you should eat legumes like grams chana
or different types of lentils
These are good sources of complex carbohydrates
And they also have fiber and protein
Then you focus on other healthy foods like fruits and vegetables
Kidney beans rajma chickpeas chole  soy protein soya chunks
gram powdered sattu fruits berries
dry fruits peanuts walnuts
pumpkin seeds chia seeds
flax seeds spices eggs
Dairy items like milk curd and cottage cheese paneer
contain healthy fats
They should be eaten in controlled amounts
It is important to mention that many people think that they are eating a balanced diet
But in reality their diet is not balanced
In North India you must have seen many people
eating 34 rotis with half a bowl of vegetables
This is not the right proportion
Unknowingly in their homecooked meals many people
eat more rotis in a higher proportion of carbs
They should increase the amount of vegetables
Other than water what else should one eat?
Drink water eat green vegetables
green is very good for the body
It contains antioxidants  it is good for the skin
I eat a lot of vegetables
Dont be stingy in buying vegetables
And second dont bargain with the vegetable vendor
Even if you save 510 by paying less to a poor person
you wont be able to build a palace
If you want to save money
dont spend 150 on burgers
dont spend 400 on pizza
The online food delivery apps that you use
on which you spend thousands every month
save money there
I would say stop relying on food delivery apps
Use that money to buy nuts seeds fruits and other healthy food
If you dont want to cook food hire someone
Someone will get employment and you will be able to eat healthy and tasty food
Now lets talk about what you should not eat in a healthy weight loss diet
First of all refined flour
Refined carbohydrates like refined flour get digested very quickly in your body
You can see unhealthy spikes in your blood sugar levels because of this
And if you eat many things made of refined flour
then after 12 hours of eating  you will start feeling hungry again
Because shortly after eating these  your blood sugar levels drop rapidly
The second problem with refined flour is that
it has bad cholesterol  known as LDL cholesterol
which causes arteries to clog increase in blood pressure
increases hunger increases craving for sweets
Second stop eating sugar
This is the same problem with refined sugar
which is also called added sugar
I explained this in the video on cold drinks
This added sugar is not only found in cold drinks but also in ice creams candies biscuits etc
Third stop eating bad fats
As I told you earlier
there are two types of fats
Good fats and bad fats
Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats  are beneficial for us
We get these good fats from plant sources
Like peanuts olive oil pumpkin seeds sesame seeds
almonds pistachios walnuts sunflower oil flaxseed oil
On the other hand we need very little saturated fats
But most people eat a lot of saturated fats
They are found in butter raw coconut oil or clarified butter desi ghee
If you eat a lot of saturated fats for many years it increases the risk of heart attack
Palm oil also has saturated fats which is found in most packaged foods in India
And then comes trans fats  which are the most harmful
These trans fats are found in refined oil which is usually in everything that you eat out
Fried food fried chicken  fried momos fried doughnuts french fries
Indian street food golgappas samosas  all of these have high value of trans fats
because they are deep fried
Deepfried foods should be avoided
Some people watch this and say  that I am fearmongering
Theres a channel called Foodpharmer
they make good healthrelated videos
But people accuse him of fearmongering since he points out things that one shouldnt eat
Fearmongering means spreading fear about something unnecessary
But the thing here is that these things  are they are actually very dangerous
Avoid eating as much packaged food as possible
These are ultraprocessed food items made in factories
They are made of everything thats harmful to us
Refined flour added sugar  artificial sweeteners palm oil
artificial food colours harmful preservatives
First lets look at the things made of refined flour
Biscuits Rusk Mathri Chakli
Namakpare Fanpuffs Samosa Kachodi
Pav Bhaji Vada Pav Aloo Patty
Hot Dog Bhature Kulcha
Tandoori Roti Naan Malabar Paratha
Pizza Donuts Chowmein
Spring Rolls Momos Jalebi
Ghevar Gulab Jamun Pancakes
Muffins Cakes Sandwiches Phew!
In fact even your favourite Tandoori Masala Chhaap has 40 refined flour
And what are the other harmful things  in these food items?
Bad oil the deepfried things
like Bhature Samosas Kachori Momos
the examples I just listed out
Added sugar apart from this cold drinks ice cream candies chocolates biscuits
cereals packaged juice and even the expensive biscuits
which are sold as highfiber multigrain digestive
contain refined flour sugar palm oil
raising agents artificial flavouring substances
Most people consume these on a daily basis
I would like to give you a 30day challenge
stop eating these which contain these 4 things
Maida added sugar bad oil or trans fats and packaged food
Dont eat these things for 30 days
and youll see a transformation in yourself
After these 30 days youll feel
much more healthy
Youll have more energy
Youll be able to concentrate more on work and studies
You might be thinking  that I havent left out any ingredients
What can one eat if not these things?
Dont be disheartened
Because therere so many things to eat other than these
You can eat rotisabzi with very little ghee or butter
Idli Upma Poha Dhokla
Omelette Moong Dal Cheela Dosa
Uttapam which is made with very little butter
Milk Curd Lassi
Boiled Eggs Natural Fruit Juice Cheekushake
Anjeershake Misi Roti Tawa Paratha
Raita Butter Milk Jeera Rice Biryani
Hara Bhara Kebab Mushroom Tikka Paneer Tikka
You can eat these if they are made in desi ghee butter or olive oil
The interesting thing is that when you  start eating more of these things
and less of the unhealthy things
you will notice a transformation
your taste buds will start changing
You will stop craving for that unhealthy food
This happens a lot to me
I never feel like eating packaged food
You will crave fresh fruits and fresh vegetables
If you are not used to eating all this fresh food
you can start with your favourite fruit or vegetables
Also learn to control your portions while eating
Always drink a glass of water before eating
so that you dont need to eat much
Eat on small plates with small spoons
and eat slowly
Dont eat so much that your stomach is 100 full
Eat till it is 80 full
I had talked about this in the  video on the Worlds Oldest Human
How in Japan people have a philosophy of
eating only till they are 80 full
When you eat more vegetables
which have more fibre and more volume
youll feel less hungry  youll have less space in your stomach
and youll consume fewer calories
Now this was all about food
Apart from this the most important thing is exercise
There are three different types of exercises
First stamina or cardio exercises
which are important for your cardiovascular fitness
Like swimming running or playing any other sport
The exercises that increase your heart rate
Second stretching exercises
they are very important for your flexibility
These include exercises like Surya Namaskar and Yoga
And third strength training
which is important for your muscle strength and muscle endurance
These include lifting heavy weights
going to the gym doing pushups  squats planks or lifting dumbbells
So ideally all these 3 types of exercises  should be balanced in a healthy lifestyle
But for weight loss it doesnt matter  what type of exercises you do
as long as these exercises are helping to burn calories
Some exercises obviously burn more calories than others
Like running rope skipping playing  badminton football and squash
Some exercises burn fewer calories
like playing cricket doing yoga or stretching
So broadly speaking you have to keep in mind that
you should burn more calories  if you want to lose more weight
But you should do the exercises in the form you like
Whether you do Zumba for 30 minutes
or run for 30 minutes its up to you
Apart from this movement should be  included in your daytoday life
like walking or cycling as much as possible
The extra calories that are burned by these activities
adds up throughout the day
Always remember doing something  is much better than doing nothing
Some people search for  best exercises to lose belly fat
Or the best exercises to lose facial fat
Friends these are only myths
To some extent particular muscles can be toned
but spot reduction is more or less not possible
Most of the research and studies that have been done
do not support this
The areas where our body stores fat
and the areas where the fat is burned by burning calories
depends entirely on the body
Your job is to exercise
your body will decide for itself  from where the fat should be burned
When you do this consistently
then overall one day your body  will get into a good shape
This depends on genetics
the areas where your body will lose fat
I would like to mention a final point here  stress
There is a significant link between weight gain and stress
When you feel stressed
your bodys cortisol levels increase
This reduces your metabolism
and increases your craving for fat and sugar
it is important to manage stress as well
For this you can do meditation play sports
or spend time with friends and family in real life
I have told you a lot of things in this video
but I have summarized all the useful  information on weight loss for you
Lets do a small rewind
so that you remember everything
The simple principle behind weight loss  is Calorie Deficit
Control the calories you are eating
and increase the calories you are burning
The calories you are eating should come  from your nutritious balanced diet
Eat more whole grains fibrous fruits  vegetables and proteins
so that your stomach feels fuller
So that you feel less hungry
Avoid eating refined flour white sugar  bad oils and packaged food
so that your food cravings can be reduced
and you can focus on healthy nutrients
Move your body daily in some way or the other
and include exercises in your regular routine
Cardio exercises strength training and stretching exercises
Make sure to sleep for 79 hours daily
and keep stress away from your life
And also remember that spot reduction doesnt work
and being healthy
doesnt mean you have to fit some beauty standard
These things make a perfect plan  for healthy weight loss
If you want to follow this plan
then write your goal in the comments below
And after a month  after completing this 30day challenge
give us an update in the comments
how the transformation was for you
To manage your time in life
you will find the link to download  the course in the description below
And if you liked this video
then you will definitely like this one
In this I have talked about Blue Zones
The zones all over the world  where people live the longest
What is the secret behind their health?
Its all in the video
I will tell you a religious story
and you have to guess the names of the main characters in this story
This is the story of a man
who has a name with the last two letters
being AM
This man had a wife
whose name started with S
The husband and wife were exiled from their city
and they travelled far towards the south
A relative of this man traveled with them
whose name starts with L
On their journey
a king from a faraway kingdom
takes the woman with him
The last letter of the kings name is N
There are many other things in the story
but in short the woman is freed
and escapes from the kings captivity
The man and woman then return
Can you fill in the blanks here?
You can pause the video and think for a few seconds
You might think its an easy question
this is the story of Ramayana
in which the characters are Ram Sita Lakshman and Ravan
But how would it feel if I say that
these fillintheblanks fit in another story
Where our characters are
Abraham Sarah Lot and Pharaoh
This is the story of Prophet Abraham
A common prophet in
Christianity Islam and Judaism
A while ago I made a video on Ramayana
which was liked a lot by you
If you havent seen it
Ill put the link in the description below
You can go and watch it later
So continuing with this religion series
in todays episode lets talk about
Prophet Abraham
Now some of you might have wondered
what was the point of making videos on religions?
That too in todays world
Friends I believe that
looking at todays world
I feel that it is necessary to make videos on religions
Because religion has become something
that is being exploited in terribly
by politicians and media
to spread fear among people
Using religion alone
hatred is being spread among people
And I think videos do  a good job of countering it
The more people from different  religions learn about other religions
the more will we be able to relate to each other
The more love and brotherhood will develop among people
So lets start todays story
which is common in three religions
Many people believe that Prophet Abraham
was the first figure to preach monotheism
Monotheism means to
believe in only one God
Its opposite is polytheism
Polytheism means that you
believe that there are many gods
Monotheists say that there is only one God
These three religions
are classified as Abrahamic religions
And the word Abrahamic
is derived from Prophet Abraham
Many people believe that
Prophet Abraham was the first prophet
Especially Jews believe this
Many Christians also believe this
But on the other hand some Christians say that
it was not Abraham but Enoch
who was the first prophet
Genesis chapter 5 verse 22 says that
Enoch walked with God for 300 years
Genesis is actually the first book of the Bible
Enoch is said to be a descendant of Adam
And Adam is believed to be the first human being
by the believers of these three religions
Muslims believe that Adam
was the first Prophet
So lets start our story
with the story of Adam and Eve
You must have heard the names
Adam and Eve somewhere
Adam is also called Aadm
And it is believed that God
created him from the soil
God gave him breath
and he became a living being
Throughout this video
I will use different words to refer to God
but they will mean the same entity
because we are talking about monotheism
So irrespective of the word were referring to the one God
In the 1500s there was a very famous painter
He made this historic painting
which can be found in the Vatican City Museum today
He wants to show in this painting
how God created Adam
After creating Adam
he was placed in the Garden of Eden
There were two trees in the garden
The first tree was called the Tree of Life
and the other was called
the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil
God told him to eat whatever he wanted
but not to eat any fruit from the other tree
That was the one condition
Then God thought that
the man would feel very lonely
there should be some helper with him
So after this
God made animals and birds from the soil
But there was no suitable helper
Then God sent Adam to sleep
and when he was sleeping
He took out a bone from his body
and made a woman out of that bone
Adam named this woman Eve
Eve is also called Ava
which means life
One day a snake came
and tried to mislead Eve
into eating forbidden fruit
The tree whose fruits were forbidden by God
the snake said that eating  those fruits would enlighten them
That they will become like God
Tricked by the snake
Eve ate that fruit
and fed it to her husband Adam
And when God came to know about this
He was angry
In anger He curses them
The snake was cursed that
it will keep crawling on his stomach all its life
and will eat dust all its life
The woman was cursed that
she will have to give birth to children
And while giving birth to children
she will have to endure intense labor pains
And Adam was cursed to
having to work for his entire life
He will have to work hard to earn a living
And with this
Adam and Eve were thrown out of the Garden of Eden
And they spend the rest of their lives on Earth
Its a very interesting story
It has been referred to many times
in pop culture movies
One movie that I saw was called Knowing
It is a science fiction movie from 2009
At the end of this movie
Adam and Eve were shown
But if we move ahead in our story
then after thousands of years
the population of humans increases on earth
and God starts looking at humans
And seeing everything God thinks that
humans had become very evil
They were becoming worse
God starts regreting creating humans
Who turned out so evil
He decides to wipe out the whole earth
All the humans animals and birds
He wanted to end all
But in the meantime
there was a good person
Christians call him Noah
and Muslims call him Nuh
So in the eyes of God
Noah was a very good person
So God decided to tell him His plans
He told Noah that
He was going to cause a great flood on earth
A great flood will come
Everything will be wiped out
He told him to make a big boat
He told him to get on the boat
and to bring his wife their three sons and their wives
And apart from this
to bring a male and a female of each living organism
on his ark
And obviously he was asked to take sufficient food with them
for everyone to survive
So God waited for Noah to make this boat ark
and when it was completely built
there was a flood on the entire earth
It rained continuously for 40 days and 40 nights
Everything on Earth was submerged under water
for 150 days
But Noahs Ark was afloat on the water
and the people on it were alive
Finally the boat reached the mountain of Ararat
It was the only dry land
With time the water starts receding
and all the people on this ark
came out and got a new chance to live
I would like to refer to another science fiction film
which had an indirect reference to Noahs Ark
the film 2012
At the end of this film
everything was submerged under water
but some ships were built
in which some people were able to survive
If you notice
many Hollywood films have
parts of the story which
are inspired by religious scriptures
Many of them are direct films
like the film Noah
which is based on this story
But in our story
Noah made an offering to God
He asks God to promise that
He will never destroy life like that again
there is a similar story in Hinduism
The story of King Manu
A small fish asks for protection from King Manu
And when the King saved it
the fish kept growing
According to the Puranas
this fish was actually Matsya
an incarnation of Lord Vishnu
This fish tells King Manu
that a big flood was about to come
and everything will be destroyed
And tells him to make a boat to survive
So King Manu built a huge boat
which carried many living creatures  plants and Saptarishis
And when the great flood came
they could survive because of the boat
And the Matsya awatar
guided them safely to the Himalayas
Now another mindblowing thing is that
in the ancient civilization of Mesopotamia
there is a similar story written in the scriptures found there
The Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh
Here a great sage Utnapishtim was warned
about a great flood
and he saved his relatives
living creatures and food in a huge boat
Not only that in Greek mythology
due to the anger of God Zeus
a great flood comes
Deucalion was warned about this flood
by his father Prometheus
Deucalion and his wife built a boat
to escape the flood
Moving on with the story
we come to Abram
There is a famous story of Abram
when he broke the idols
This story is not mentioned in the Hebrew Bible
but it is mentioned in Midrash Genesis Rabbah chapter 38
Midrash is basically a commentary on the Bible
by a Jewish Rabbi
We will find this story
in chapter 21 verses 5170 of the Quran
with some differences
The basic story is that
it was the era when people used to worship idols
Abrams father Terah
was a man who made the idols
And worshipped them
One day Abrams father went on a trip far away
and left Abram in charge of his shop
A man came to the shop to buy an idol
Abram asks him for his age
50 years said the man
50 years? said Abram
Abram said that a 50 years old man
would be worshipping an idol which is not even older than 1 year
Hearing this the man was embarrassed
and left the shop
On another occasion when no other person was present
Abram picked up a stick
and broke all the idols
And then he placed that stick in the hands of the biggest idol
When people return they were shocked
Some say that Abram must have done it
because he always criticised worshipping idols
They asked Abram why he did it
Abram replied that the idols were actually fighting with each other
And that the biggest idol
picked up the stick and broke all the smaller idols
Abram told the people to ask the biggest idol
why he broke the others
People called out his bluff
They said that the idols cannot fight with each other
Neither can they speak
So Abrams asked
Why do you worship these idols
when these statues cannot speak or do anything?
You will not gain anything from it
nor will you suffer any loss from it
Abram was ordered to go into a big fire
And if Abram was right
the real God will save him
So Abram went into that fire
and God saved him
Because of this story
idols are not worshipped
in Judaism and Islam
And some conservative Muslims
in fact some conservative Hindus also say that
because Hindus worship idols
Hindus are Kafirs for Muslims
How true is this?
If you look closely
Hindus dont worship idols
They worship God through the idol
Its like you remember your father
by looking at his photo
You remember your father through the photo
and show him your love
But it doesnt mean that
you forget your actual father
and start showing love only to this physical photo
and start remembering the photo
Similarly every Hindu knows that
God is being worshipped through the idols
The physical idol is not being actually worshipped
Acharya Prashanth gave a good answer to this
when I spoke to him
The idol has been a successful experiment
The idol has been a good means to reach the formless
And when the idol is worshipped
it is never said that the idol is the true God
It is said that I will use this idol
to reach the true God
I will use the idol to
reach the formless
Even Christians do not consider this to be wrong
you will find Jesus and Marys idols in many churches
Many passages are cited by them
to prove this
Chapter 20 verse 4 and 5 in Exodus of the Hebrew Bible
it is written that God has forbidden  to make idols of any other thing
He has forbidden bowing down before idols
It should be noted that
it is not Gods idols
it is forbidden to bow down before idols of other things
Now lets move 5 chapters ahead
Chapter 25 verse 17 to 22 says
God himself commands Prophet Moses
to make a mercy seat of pure gold
To make idols of Cherub on both sides
God says that he will speak to Moses
from among these statues
This is not the only example
Another book Hebrew Bible Ezekiel
chapter 41 verse 25
Read the description of the Temple of Jerusalem
There were carvings of cherub  and palm trees on the doors and walls
So it doesnt seem like God
has a problem with us using his photos
or making his idols
As long as we use those things
to worship God
Not to worship those idols or photos
Quran Surah 4 Ayat 48
is often quoted
as the quote to show that
Quran is against making idols
Here too we see that
Do not associate partners with God
That is dont worship anyone other than God
This sentiment is seen in Chapter 31 Ayat 13 of the Quran
Worship only God
So to say that all Muslims
consider all nonMuslims to be Kafirs
is a wrong notion
The people who want to spread hatred
are the ones who spread such misinformation
The meaning of the word Islam
is Submission before God
Submitting before God
And the meaning of the word Muslim
is the one who submits before God
That is why from the perspective of a liberal Muslim
any person who believes in any religion
is a Muslim
Because in his religion
whatever name he has given to God
he is worshipping the God
and submitting to him
This is not my personal opinion
this is how it is
Even at that time
there were many other religions in Arabia
If you see chapter 2 verse 62 of the Quran
it says that Jews Christians and Sabians
were counted among the believers
These were the people who believed in God
It mentions fighting
only those people
who believe an idol to be God
Around 600 AD
there was a tribe called the Quraysh tribe
They lived in the region of Saudi Arabia
They believed that their central god
was Hubal
Which was actually an idol
made of stone
and whose right hand was broken
Quraysh tribe replaced its right hand
with a golden hand
With a hand made of gold
Now this idol was actually broken
by Prophet Muhammad in 630 AD
Dont confuse mythological stories and actual history
What I just told you is actual proven history
And the stories before that
were mythological and biblical stories
If we talk about ancient Egyptians
they worshipped the jackal gods
Like Anubis and Wepwawet
And apart from stone idols
another type of idol worship has been mentioned in the Quran
To idolize something
Like in chapter 18 verse 32 to verse 46
a warning has been given
Dont idolize your property or wealth
Dont worship your wealth
In chapter 25 it has also been said that
people often turn their desire their ego
into God
And you will find the same warning in Hinduism
In Hinduism even though we get to see different forms of God
we get to see different avatars of God
but in Bhagavad Gita chapter 10 it is mentioned that
Lord Krishna is saying
By the way if you want to understand Bhagwat Gita better
I would suggest this audiobook on KUKU FM
Shreemad Bhagwat Gita Samasyao Ka Samadhan in Hindi
It is a long audiobook
With more than 25 hours of content
But its been broken down into small chapters of 810 minutes
So you dont have to feel overwhelmed
You can understand it step by step
Apart from this on KUKU FM
you can also get an audiobook for Jesus Christs stories

Do check it out
And not just in Gita
but we get to see mention of monotheism
in Rigveda Mandal 1 Shlok 46
The Rishi is called by many names
Agni Yam Indra Varun
Look at Chapter 32 of Yajurveda
It is written that He is Agni
Aditya which is Sun
He is Vayu Chandrama Jal
There is no one like him
His name is great
He is in all beings
Before him there was nothing
All people have been created by that God
Similarly if we talk about the other meaning
then in the texts of different religions
whether it is Hinduism Buddhism or Christianity
it is mentioned in the scriptures
to never idolize your ego
To never worship your material desires or wealth
So you can see how these things mentioned in different religions
align with each other
How similar these religions are to each other fundamentally
But one thing is worth mentioning
Even though in Islam Christianity or Judaism
the people of other religions are not kafirs
but atheists are definitely kafirs
People who dont believe in any god
are definitely called kafirs
Because the word kafir means the same thing
Kufr means disbelief
and kafir means one who disbelieves in God
A person who doesnt believe in God
But does this mean that
we should kill all the nonbelievers?
There are only two ways people can say such things to you
First psychopaths
The terrorists who actually want to kill people
And second people who spread WhatsApp propaganda
who want to instil fear in people
What is actually written in religious scriptures?
Quran chapter 9 verse 5 says
Kill the Mushrik
meaning disbelievers
wherever you find them
You will find such lines in many religious scriptures
Hebrew Bible Book 1 Samuel Chapter 15
conveys the message of God to Saul
Now go attack the Amalekites
and totally destroy everything that belongs to them
Do not spare them
In Christianity Gospel of Mattew Chapter 10 Verses 3436
Jesus tells his disciples
Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth
I did not come to bring peace
but a sword
Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2 Shloka 31 to 38
Lord Krishna tells Arjun
Happy are the Kshatriyas
the warriors to whom such fighting opportunities come unsought
opening for them the doors of the heavenly planets
Such calls for violence can be found in almost every religious scripture
If I start explaining all of it
it will be a long video
But in short all these lines of scriptures
are very heavily contextual
If you read it out of context you will feel that
it is true that they are promoting violence
But if you read it in context you will understand
the context it is being discussed in
For example when Lord Krishna tells Arjun
he says that when the Mahabharata war was going on
when Prophet Muhammad tells his followers
it is being said
in the context of the fight with Quraysh tribe
The same thing is applicable in the case of Samuel
And the line of Jesus here
has a metaphorical meaning
Actually in any scripture it is not said that
one should go and start killing innocent people
It is another thing that
the terrorists and orthodox people in every religion
deliberately misinterpret these religion scriptures
And present them in such a way that
people are influenced to do violence
People start to hate
In our country we see such great Islamic scholars
like Wahiduddin Khan
who was awarded the Padma Vibhushan award
by the Indian government in 2021
He says that Islam is the religion of peace and tolerance
He conveys this message to people
And on the other hand there are people like
terrorist Osama Bin Laden
who brainwash people by saying that
Islam tells you to kill
Similarly if you learn Hinduism from the right scholars
you will learn love and affection
But if you listen to the evil people
they will misrepresent these verses of the Gita in a way that
will force you to take up arms
Nowhere is it written that religion demands violence
And you should be alerted of this
that there is a centralized conspiracy unit
that is plotting such conspiracies
of using something that is not even written in the scriptures
by writing it in Sanskrit
and spreading it through WhatsApp and other sources
Now lets talk about the 4th story of Abram
which I talked about at the beginning of the video
The same story which was
quite similar to the Ramayana
But if you go into the details
it is not that similar
It is just a coincidence
that there were so many similarities
In this story God told Abram
to leave his home
and go in search of a place
that God is going to show him
Abram his wife Sarai
and his nephew Lot
leave their home
It was by chance that Abram
was very similar to Ram
Sarai to Sita  and Lot to Lakshman
They go to many places
and finally take turn towards Egypt
to escape a famine
When they were about to enter Egypt
Abram tells his wife
I know how beautiful you are
When the Egyptians see you
they will see that you are my wife
and they might kill me
While keeping you alive
But if we say that you are not my wife
but my sister
then they will treat me well
and my life will be saved
The kings of Egypt at that time were known as Pharaohs
The Pharaohs officials saw Sarai
praise her and take her to their palace
Because Abram said that he was her brother
Abram gets good treatment
and Abram was given many sheep
cattle donkeys servants and camels
But suddenly Pharaohs house
was hit by a lot of serious diseases
So Pharaoh suddenly calls Abram
and asks What have you done to me?
Why didnt you tell me that she was your wife?
Why did you say that she was your sister?
I had made her my wife
But now take your wife and go back
So on Pharaohs orders
Abram and his wife and whatever they had
were sent out of Egypt
After this Abram went to Negev and Bethel
and the shepherds of Abram and Lot
start fighting with each other
So Abram and Lot
went their separate ways
At this point Abram lived on the land of Canaan
Abram and Sarai did not have a child
Sarai gave Abram her slave woman Hagar
and a child was born
and he was named Ishmael
God makes an agreement with Abram
that he would be the father of many nations
Because of this God renamed Abram
and names him Abraham
This is the reason why I was
calling Abraham as Abram
Because it was only after this story
that Abram was named Abraham
and Sarai was named Sarah
God promised Abraham
all the land of Canaan
And what is the description of Canaan exactly?
These are the places that range from
the valley of Egypt
to the Euphrates River
That is the presentday Israel
West Bank Gaza Jordan
and Syria and Lebanons southern areas
They were all part of this land
All of this is considered to be a part of this land
What is the connection with actual history?
When the Zionist movement started in Israel
the Zionists said that
the land promised by God
was for the Jews
So when Jews were prosecuted in Europe for centuries
they moved here in 1900 after that
Moving forward in the story
God promised Sarah
that He will give her a son
And then Isaac is born
By this time the child Ishmael
did not have a good attitude
So Sarah told Abraham
to send him away
Abraham hesitates whether or not
to send his son away
But when he asks God
God told him to send Ishmael away
The slave woman Hagar
went with her son Ishmael to the desert
God arranged water for them
and promised Hagar that
one day her son will make a great nation
Jews and Christians believe that
they are the descendants of Isaac
And Muslims believe that
they are the descendants of Ishmael
This is the point of the story
from which these Abrahamic religions
separate from each other
Jews believe that Isaac had a son named Jacob
Who was later renamed Israel
And that Israel was actually the ancestor
of 12 tribes of Israel
Thats why today all the Jews believe that
they are actually the descendants
of Isaacs son Jacob
On the other hand in Christianity
Jesus is the most important prophet
Christians believe that Jesus
is actually the descendant of Isaac
And because they believe in Jesus
they consider themselves a spiritual descendant of Isaac
Third Muslims believe that
Abraham and Ishmael together
built the Kaaba in Mecca
which is the most sacred site of Islam
Thats why Muslims trace back
their spiritual lineage to Ishmael
So these were some interesting stories
about these three Abrahamic religions
You can comment below whether you liked them or not
If you liked them
what other religious videos would you like to see?
There are many stories to tell
The story of Prophet Joseph
the story of Moses
the Ten Commandments
and the conquest of Canaan by Joshua
And then fastforwarding to the
storied of Prophet Jesus and Prophet Muhammad
And apart from this there are other religions
like Buddhism Jainism and Zoroastrianism

On 1st January 2024
when the world was celebrating  the beginning of a new year
Japan was hit by a terrible 76magnitude earthquake
In Western Japan scenes of devastation
are emerging after a 76magnitude earthquake
shook the country
k!lling dozens of people
This earthquake was not alone
Numerous earthquakes small and big followed this
In total more than 155 earthquakes
occurred in just one day
Because of this sea waves about 1 meter high
hit the west coast of Japan
Japans meteorological agency
had also issued a major tsunami alert
Although this warning was downgraded later
but the earthquake itself  caused substantial damage
Dozens of buildings were completely destroyed
Electricity was cut off for thousands of houses
Some places were engulfed in flames
And as of 2nd January
55 people have been declared d3ad
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida says that
this situation is a battle against time
Rescue operations are underway
and efforts are being made
to save the trapped people
But on 2nd January
another unfortunate incident  took place in this country
A Japan Airlines airplane
crashed with a Japan Coast  Guard aircraft in Tokyo airport
Thereafter both planes caught on fire
Japan Airlines plane has caught fire
at Tokyos Hanida Airport
And all runways
at the airport have been closed
This Japan Coast Guard aircraft
was getting ready to help  people affected by the earthquake
Fortunately all the people in the other plane
were evacuated safely
But 5 out of 6 crew members in  the Coast Guard aircraft lost their lives
The 29yearold plane captain
was the only one who could survive
Two big questions arise here
First why are there so many  earthquakes and tsunamis in Japan?
Second how does Japan  deal with these disasters?
Because if an earthquake of the same  magnitude had hit any other country
perhaps thousands of people  would have lost their lives
The d3ath toll in Japan is  below 100 as of now
How does Japan protect itself against such circumstances?
Lets understand this in this video
The earthquake that just hit Japan
is named the 2024 Sea of Japan earthquake
or the Noto Peninsula earthquake
You can see its exact location  on this map on the screen
Theres a region called the Noto Peninsula in Japan
You have read about peninsulas in school
It is a piece of land
surrounded by water on three sides
The epicentre of this earthquake was located here
The Sea of Japan  in the west of the country
It is 500 km away from Tokyo Japans capital
But even so
this earthquake was felt in Tokyo
Now our first question is
why do so many earthquakes take place in Japan?
The answer to this  is hidden in the map
Look at this map
This is the map of the Earths  16 major tectonic plates
Tectonic plates are the outermost layer of the Earth
made up of the Earths crust  and the upper part of the mantle
The heat that is generated in Earths core
releases convection currents
which causes the tectonic plates to move slowly
These are the 16 main tectonic plates
that move slowly year after year
When they collide with each other
earthquakes happen
So the countries and the areas
that lie on the boundaries of the tectonic plates
are prone to earthquakes the most
And the thing about Japan is that
it is situated at a place where
four tectonic plates come together
The Pacific plate the Philippine plate
the Eurasian plate and  the North American plate
This is the biggest reason why
so many earthquakes are seen in Japan
Among them the Pacific plate stands out a bit
Since it has the highest amount of tectonic activity
So the boundary of the Pacific plate
is known as the Pacific Ring of Fire
Because this causes the highest  number of earthquakes in the world
As well as the highest number of volcanoes
To some extent this is true for the other plates as well
And the countries located on their boundaries
witness a higher frequency of earthquakes
For example if you see Indias northern boundary
the boundary between the Indian and Eurasian plates
that passes through Nepal
amidst the Himalayan mountains
this causes devastating earthquakes in Nepal
The earthquakes in North India
in Delhi and its surrounding regions
in most cases their epicentre
lies between these two plates
Compare this with regions like  Australia Russia or Europe
where you rarely see any earthquakes
When was the last time you heard about
a terrible earthquake in Australia?
Its not like there have been  no earthquakes in Australia at all
But the regions that lie in  the middle of the tectonic plates
get earthquakes at a lower frequency
And when earthquakes do occur
they are not as devastating
And the reason behind this is that
these major tectonic plates are  made up of minor tectonic plates
And at times the collision  between the major tectonic plates
can be felt even in the middle of the plate
But depending on the way  that these main tectonic plates
collide with each other
various types of boundaries can be formed
Such as the Convergent boundary
when one plate collides and slips under the other
Or Divergent boundary
where both plates move away from each other
Or Transform boundary
when both plates move parallel against each other
Among these the most dangerous earthquakes
occur when convergent or  transform boundaries are formed
And the boundary of the Pacific plate
is a convergent boundary
It has a specific subtype
known as the Subduction Zone
In the Subduction Zone
causes the most powerful earthquakes
because in this type of collision
when one plate collides with another
it goes right under the other
submerging into the mantle
And when this happens
as you can see in the diagram
a deep cavity or hole is formed under the sea
on the boundaries of the two plates
which is called a Trench
These underwater trenches are  often the deepest point in the ocean
They can be 3 to 4 kilometres  deeper than the surrounding seabed
The deepest point on Earth in underwater
known as the Mariana Trench
This trench is 109 kilometres deep
In Mariana Trench the point Challenger Deep
is the deepest point in any ocean and on Earth
You would have heard about it a lot
But perhaps you might not know that
There is a deep trench in the East of Japan
known as the Japan Trench
The depth of this trench is 84 km
There are very few countries in the world
that are located so close to such deep sea
This map shows you
the depth of the sea in  different parts of the world
The lighter the colour
the shallower the ocean
And the darker the colour
the deeper the ocean
Look around most of the countries
Indian coastlines
African coastlines
South American coastlines
they are shown in a light colour
But zoom in and look at Japan
On the right side of Japan
there is a massive dark area
This is the Japan Trench
And through it crosses
our imaginary Ring of Fire
The Pacific Ring of Fire
Due to the movement of the tectonic plate
such horrific earthquakes are caused
the sea is so deep here
most number of volcanoes are found here
and due to this
the area that gets the most  number of tsunamis
is the country of Japan
Japans coastline is very close to this trench
which means that the tsunami waves  have to travel only a short distance
and there isnt sufficient time for issue warning
For this reason
Japan is at the highest risk from tsunamis
In fact the word tsunami
is derived from Japanese
is made up of Tsu and Nami
Tsu means harbour
and Nami means wave
meaning harbourwave
Harbour is also known as a seaport
Since there were so many tsunamis in Japan
when the news of the Japanese  tsunamis spread all over the world
the word tsunami became popular
and people started using it since then
Approximately 90 of the worlds earthquakes
take place in this Pacific Ring of Fire
And approximately 75 of active volcanoes
are also found here
Since the geography of this area is such
historically Japan has always been
in a danger zone
But perhaps this is why Japan
has been at the forefront
at controlling the damage caused  by earthquakes and tsunamis
What does Japan do exactly?
Before talking about it Id like to tell you that
if you want to learn more about Japans history
there are amazing audiobooks on KUKU FM
such as this one talking about Hiroshima and Nagasaki
It is a 15 hour long audiobook
that tells you the story of  the nuclear bombing of the two cities
Apart from this there is an audiobook on
Oppenheimer The Father of The Atom Bomb
There are numerous audiobooks  on KUKU FM across various topics
Whether it is fiction history geography or politics
Overall it is an amazing audiolearning platform
where you can listen to books

The buildings built in Japan have to  meet strict earthquakeproof standards
There are three standards
The lowest is the Taishin standard
The requirement mandates the
minimum thickness of the pillars  walls and beams of the buildings
So that if an earthquake shakes the building
the building can resist it
Second is the Seishin standard
which is recommended for tall buildings
where they are required to
install dampers to absorb the earthquakes energy
They need to put large thick rubber mats  under the foundation of the building
These rubber mats absorb the  vibrations of earthquakes very well
But there is a third standard  which is even more strict
the most advanced standard the Menshin Standard
In this the entire structure of the  building is isolated from the ground
Layers of lead steel and rubber are installed
so that the building moves independently of the ground
Even if the ground shakes  the building can remain stable
This iconic Skytree tower in Tokyo city
was built using the same standard
This is one of the most earthquakeresistant buildings in the city
When the horrific Tohoku earthquake hit Japan in 2011
the magnitude of that earthquake was 90
This building did not even get a scratch
On the other hand
Japan has adopted many strategies  to protect itself against tsunamis
although they havent been as successful
as those protecting Japan against earthquakes
They have built tsunamicontrolled forests
Planting a large number of trees
to stop the force of tsunamis
They have built coastal dikes
which look like this
These are long structures built of stones
These dikes are very expensive to build
but they can successfully reduce the impact of tsunamis
Apart from these tsunami evacuation towers are built
In areas with a highrisk of tsunami  and a significant population
since people do not get a lot of time for evacuation
they are told to take shelter in these towers
located at a high point
to be protected from the tsunamis
They have improved their warning systems
Evacuation drills are regularly conducted
to help the locals understand
what they need to do in case of a tsunami
And how to prepare for rescue operations
And finally they have built walls near the sea
Sea walls
Japan has a 22000milelong coastline
40 of which is surrounded  by these concrete sea walls
But unfortunately these walls  are not always effective
As it happened in 2011
The earthquake that caused this tsunami
was the most powerful earthquake in Japans history
This tsunami caused the  Fukushima nuclear disaster too
Nuclear reactors were damaged
leading to radiation leaks
that spread over the Pacific Ocean
The 2011 earthquake and tsunami
was the most devastating in Japans history
Around 20000 people lost their lives in it
After this their government made their standards stricter
Thankfully this years disaster
did not turn out to be as dangerous and fatal

I wish you all a very happy Diwali in advance
Last year I made a video on Ramayana
in which I discussed how some people try to justify Ravana
They try to use illogical arguments to prove that
Ravana was not that bad
I countered those points in detail in that video
And in todays Diwali special video
I would like to focus on three things
First an allegation that many people put on Lord Ram
When Ram returned to Ayodhya
he left his pregnant wife Sita
Along with this some people also say that
Ram k!lled a Shudra named Shambuk
just because he was meditating
In fact these are two such things that
Dr Ambedkar mentioned in his booklet  Riddles of Ram and Krishna
The second thing is one of my old clips on Ramayana which is often shared on social media
Today I would like to clarify my opinion on Ramayana
And thirdly we will expose some people
who spread filth in society using Rams name
We will understand why it is important  to protect Ram from Nathuram
Come lets get to it
Friends you must have seen this in  some old movies and storybooks
When the story ends it says
And they lived happily ever after
Look at Chapter 128 of Valmikis Ramayana
This is the last Chapter of the sixth section  the Yuddha Kand
In this our story ends
Ram was crowned the king
Vibhishan returned to Lanka
Sugreev returned to Kishkindha
Ram asked Lakshman to rule as a Prince Regent
But when Lakshman refused
he appointed Bharat
After this in Shloka 95 to Shloka 106
Rams kingdom is described
This is the section which you can consider
as the and they lived happily ever after section
Ram carried out the Paundarika  Ashvamedha Vajapeya and other rituals
and pleased the Gods
There was no danger from wild animals
There were no diseases
There were no thieves or dacoits
People lived for thousands of years
without any disease or sorrow
The old people didnt have to  perform the last rites for young people
Trees bore fruits and flowers regularly
Clouds would rain at the right time
The touch of the wind was blissful
Brahmin Kshatriya Vaishya and Shudra
were doing their own work
They were satisfied with their work
were happy and without greed
Shloka 106 says
Sarve Lakshan Sampana
Sarve Dharm Parayana
Dash Varsh Sahetrasani
Ram Rajyam Karyat
It means that everyone had distinct qualities
and everyone behaved as per dharma
That is they behaved ethically
That is why Rams reign lasted for 10000 years
Now after hearing all this  one thing must have become clear to you
this is a happily ever after ending of the story
Think for yourself
does it make sense for the story to continue after this?
If our story was incomplete in any sense
then there was no need to write this  happily ever after section in such detail
And the thing is that the  allegations that are put on Ram here
that he left Sita and k!lled a Shudra
all of that is a part of Uttar Kand
And this Uttar Kand is an addition
that was added later to the Ramayana
An addition that forcefully  continues this happily ever after ending
There is a lot of evidence that  the story actually ended there
After this last happily ever after section
only one section remained in Ramayan
which is the section of Phalashruti
This tells you about the benefits
of listening to this particular scripture
The final Shloka is written in 125
This narration is to be listened  invariably by good people
seeking for wisdom longevity health
fame fraternity intelligence
welfare and brilliance
This is the ending of the original Valmikis Ramayan
In this same Phalashruti section
there is a verse Shloka 108
in which it is mentioned that
This foremost lyric  as written at first by Valmiki
Once again it is proved that
the scripture is complete at this point
Now it is important to mention here that
in Uttar Karna there are some things
that negate the story of Valmikis Ramayan
its in contradiction
For example we saw how Ram Rajya has been described
Everyone was happy
people from all sections of society were doing their work
and lived for thousands of years without any sorrow
But Shambuks story as written in the Uttar Kand
goes against this description
In this story a Brahmins son dies
which causes him immense grief
And after that Shambuk was k!lled by Ram
But Valmiki wrote in the end
that no old person had to perform  the last rites for their young son
Listen to another example
In this story Ram sits on the Pushpak Viman
and looks for Shambuk
But in Valmikis Ramayans Chapter 127  of the Yuddha Kand is was written that
he sent Pushpak Viman back to Kuber
And while were talking about Kuber
in Chapter 13 of the Uttar Kand it is written that
Ravan and other demons
were disrupting the rituals  performed by many sages and deities
Hearing this Kuber sent a messenger to Ravan
This messenger met Vibhishan first
and he took the messenger to Ravan
Ravan then k!lled that messenger with a sword
and demons ate his d3ad body
This part of the story is a prequel
to the story of Sitas abduction
But in Valmiki Ramayan when Sita is kidnapped
Ram sent several peace messengers to Ravan
First Angad then Hanuman
When Hanuman was brought to Ravan
Ravan wondered what to do with Hanuman
He asked Vibhishan for advice
In Sundarkand Chapter 52 Shloka 15
Vibhishan lists the acceptable punishments for messengers
Cutting off the limbs
hitting them with whips
shaving the head
making a mark on the body
And he goes on to say that they  hadnt heard about k!lling a messenger
If you believe the Uttar Kand to be true
had Ravan already k!lled Kubers messenger
why would Vibhishan say this?
So friends after seeing all this evidence  one thing becomes clear
Uttar Kand is not a part of the original Ramayan
It was added later
and the way it negates the original story
it should never be considered  as a continuation of Ramayan
Now you may be wondering
who wrote this Uttar Kand and when was it written?
Historically we dont have any solid evidence
but we can guess that
it is a story which
was added to promote Brahmanical superiority and casteism
To prove that Brahmins are superior to Shudras
And Sitas story looks like an obvious attempt
to promote patriarchy
That men have power
and men control women
It seems that some casteist  and sexist people in the society
added this continuation to Ramayana
to use it for their agenda back then
And if we talk about the agenda
there are still some people
who use the name of Ram
to promote wrong things in society
to promote bad habits
To use the slogans of Jai Shri Ram  while bullying and abusing women
And these people are hurt the most
by watching my videos on religion
They are bewildered by my  audacity to talk about religion
They do not like that I tell people  about the good aspects of religion
If people start learning good things from religion
then the religious polarity  they are trying to create wont work
Often people like these try to discredit me
by showing my old clips out of context  and sharing it on social media
about what I said earlier
This is one of my clips on Ramayan  that is shared by these people
So people say because that bridge exists
it is a part of our history
That this story did actually happen
But people think of it only at one level
they dont go deeper than that
Correct they wont question it they dont go deeper than that
Correct they wont question it Try applying some deductive reasoning to it
Does the existence of a manmade thing
prove that the whole story is real?
Isnt it the same logic that
since New York City is shown in Spiderman
and since New York City exists in real life
So Spiderman is also real  Spiderman exists too
That not how it works
In this clip I am talking about
how when I was a 7 or 8yearold kid
I heard the Ramayana and wondered how it could be possible
How could there be flying vessels in those days
and someone could lift a mountain and cross a sea?
When I was a kid I still didnt believe in these things
I added that these stories are like
Santa Claus stories
I was doing this interview with Karan Singh
a famous magicianmentalist
In the interview he talks about how  he used to go to the Gurudwara
when his parents insisted
but he too didnt believe in the existence of God
We were mostly talking about  deductive reasoning and atheism
To explain critical thinking and logical fallacy  I took the example of Spiderman
How in Spidermans comics
New York City is mentioned
New York City does exist in real life
but that doesnt mean that Spiderman is real
Similarly I said that if Ram Setu is real
it doesnt mean that the  stories told in Ramayana will be real
But I never said that Ramayana never happened
It is clear that Ramayana is a religious  scripture written at some point in history
Historians estimate that Valmikis Ramayana
was written between the 7th century and the 4th century BC
But did the stories written in this epic
actually take place or not?
Unfortunately we dont know about this
I personally believe that these  things may have happened in the past
But not in the way they have been written
I believe that this is a metaphorical epic
When it is said that Lord Hanuman picked up a mountain
and flew across the sea carrying it
this is not physically possible
even a child can understand this
But this may be written like a metaphor
Because often in writing and communication
metaphors are used in this way
If I want to say that Saurabh  works very hard and does so much
I might say that he is carrying  a mountain on his shoulders
Or there is the saying I will cross the seven oceans for you
If I say this to someone
it doesnt mean that I will literally  cross the seven oceans for them
Or that Saurabh is literally  carrying a mountain on his shoulders
The metaphor means that he is very hardworking
Crossing the seven oceans means  that I will put all my heart and soul into it
Apart from this it is also possible that
while writing Ramayan the Atishayokti Alankar was used
In literature writers and poets often  exaggerate while describing real events
For example have you seen the Hollywood film 300?
In this film a historic battle has been shown
between the Persians and the Greeks
Indeed this battle did actually happen
And the Greeks fought with great bravery
But many ancient authors and filmmakers
have exaggeratedly shown that
300 Spartans fought against 1 million Persians
This number is highly exaggerated
According to historical evidence
the Greek army of 700010000 soldiers  was there to help these 300 Spartans
And they did not fight 1 million Persians
The number of Persians is estimated to  have been between 70000 and 300000
No doubt it was a highly  disproportionate and historical battle
But in films poets and writers often exaggerate things
To show things as being larger than life
so that they can be more entertaining
By the way if you like these  historical and mythological stories
then I would recommend that you check out KUKU FM
You will find many amazing audiobooks there

With a thanks to KUKU FM for sponsoring this video
lets get back to the topic
One more example of this can be  seen in this India Today article
It is written that Maharana Pratap
used to carry a spear weighing 80 kg
And two swords which weighed 208 kg in total
And his armour weighed 72 kg
So in total he used to carry  360 kg while on the battlefield
Now no doubt Maharana Pratap was very brave and powerful
but carrying 360 kg on his body  while fighting on the battlefield
is physically impossible
This is an exaggeration by poets and writers
To find out the truth visit  the City Palace Museum in Udaipur
where the armour and weapons of Maharana Pratap are kept
Their weights are also mentioned there
35 Kg
So this is my opinion on Ramayana
But if any of you think that
it is possible to lift a mountain and fly over the sea
physically possible
then you are free to believe it
I dont have any problem if you believe this
Now there will be some people who
try to provoke me into saying something against Muslims
Accusing me of talking about Hinduism only
To that I would say
I have made a video on Abrahamic religions
which you can go and watch
In that I have clearly said that
there are some stories of Islamic and Christian scriptures
which are mythologies
Even though Prophet Muhammad  and Jesus Christ are historical figures
but the stories of miracles that are attached to them
are not historical
Neither scientists nor historians believe them to be true
So this is not just my personal opinion
Whether it is the story of Jesus Christ
about how he turned water into wine
Or the story of Prophet Muhammad
how he split the moon into two parts with his sword
Or the story of Lord Hanuman
how he swallowed the sun
All these are mythological stories
They have no place in science and history
I believe that these stories are metaphorical
Like we often say I am in heaven
I am very happy I am in a state of bliss
To split the moon
maybe like breaking centuriesold traditions
Or to swallow the sun
maybe like controlling fire
To establish control over your senses
From where does all the energy on Earth come from?
So what does it mean to swallow the sun?
The biggest natural thing that you can see
Lord Hanuman went and won it
Meaning he won over nature
It doesnt mean that he ate it as a fruit
There are messages hidden in all religious scriptures
People are not concerned about the message
People are just stuck on their egos
They just want to prove that their religion is the best
Some people are even ready  to k!ll and hurt others to prove it
But they ignore the message
If you put your ego aside
you will realize that
it doesnt matter if Ram was a divine avatar
a human or just a literary character
Lord Ram is great because of his qualities
And thats why whether a person is a Hindu a Muslim
a Sikh a Christian a Buddhist  a Jain a Parsi a Jew or even an atheist
Ram is for everyone
You must have heard the saying
Rams name is greater than Ram
While using Rams name
recall his qualities
What values did he promote?
If you apply those values in your life  your life will be transformed
Ram is a great model of masculinity
Being fit and strong
but while being humble and compassionate
This is the reason why I call myself a Hindu Atheist
Because Hinduism has shaped my values
And culturally too I follow Hindu rituals
Not to humiliate anyone
like many socalled orthodox Hindus do today
But because I want to do it from the bottom of my heart
For myself
Rams name is mentioned so many  times in Haryanvi culture that
it is easy to remember all these things
Whenever we meet Ram Ram tau! Ram Ram brother
Whenever we leave we say Jai Ram ji ki! Victory to Lord Ram
The expression for being amazed Hey Ram! Oh Ram!
The expression for being sad Hey mere Ram ke karu? Oh my Ram what should I do?
When we sneeze Chhatrapati Ram ji Lord Ram
When it rains Ram ji baras gaye Lord Ram is raining
When there is confusion Ram jane ke hoya ke na Ram knows what will happen
When we have to swear Ram ki soon I swear by Ram
But today friends Rams name is in danger
Rams name is being dragged through the mud
You would have heard the saying
Talking about Ram following Nathuram
To live in India  You have to say Jai Shri Ram!
This has become a fact today
Mahatma Gandhi was a great Ram devotee
But today the followers of Nathuram Godse
are trying to hijack Ram
Nathuram Godse was a patriot
He is and will be
I consider Godse to be like a God
Godse is someone we look up to
Are you against Godse?  Hear me out
Are you against Godse or not?
Tell the nation No I am not
We see reports of how some degenerates of society
force others to say Jai Shri Ram
News from Madhya Pradesh
Uttar Pradeshs Bulandshahr
Kanpur Unnao Ghaziabad
Rajasthans Alwar
Delhi Assam Jharkhand
Gujarat Haryana Himachal
Bihar Hyderabad Telangana
Say Jai Shri Ram!
SAY IT!
This type of news comes in  from every corner of the country
People are k!lled burnt alive l!nched
in the name of Ram
If you show such news to these people
they will talk about Muslims who use the slogans of
Do you support the slogans of ?
No because no normal person supports such slogans
But the mindset of these people is that
if a Muslim person does wrong  then we will do it too
If someone else is jumping into a well  they would want to jump in too
If their purpose is to copy Muslims
then they can copy great Muslims
like Dr APJ Abdul Kalam
Dr Salim Ali the Birdman of India
or Mohammad Rafi
But no they want to copy
Muslim extremists only
Islamic t3rror!st Osama Bin Laden Hafiz Saeed
who brought shame to Islam
Now these degenerates dressed in saffron
are ruining the name of Ram similarly
Allahu Akbar means God is great
Its a good reminder
But while attacking Islamic t3rror!sts have  used this chant so many times all over the world
Look at the news
They have chanted Allahu Akbar
They have shouted Allahu Akbar
He pulled out a knife and attacked shouting Allahu Akbar
The call to prayer Azaan starts with Allahu Akbar
Which gives you a feeling of peace from the inside
I personally love Azaan
when we were shooting for Tanu Manu in Lucknow
I loved the sound of it
But the extremists use this slogan like a war cry
during t3rror!st attacks
Similarly Jai Shri Ram
is a slogan that should bring peace to your heart
But now what do we see?
a violent mob of people
carrying swords and weapons in their hands
and chanting Jai Shri Ram
Look at these news articles
We Hindus go to temples to pray
but these people and their weapons
reach mosques during Hindu festivals
They use the name of Lord Ram  to raise slogans of g3nocide
They often write on social media
Dharmo Rakshati Rakshit
They say that they are doing  this to protect their religion
Dharma Rakshati Rakshit
Religion protects those who protect it
They say that they are protecting the religion
But do you know where this quote has been taken from?
From Manusmriti
Do you know what is the definition of Dharma in this?
It is like this
There are 10 characteristics of Dharma
Patience forgiveness restraint
not stealing cleanliness
controlling of senses
increasing intelligence
gaining knowledge
practising truth and remaining calm
But do these people follow any of these characteristics?
No one is doing it
They use social media to insult and degrade others
In Mahabharata it is written again and again
Ahimsa Parmodharam  nonviolence is the utmost duty
In Ramcharitmanas Tulsidas says
Parhitsaris Dharm Nahi Bhai
Parh Pida Sam Nahi Adhmai
Theres nothing more important than helping others
Theres nothing worse than harming others
Valmiki Ramayana Ayodhya Kand Chapter 14 Shloka 3
those who have knowledge of Dharma
say that Truth is the ultimate Dharma
Dharma means to do your moral duty
to fulfil your duties
But today some people use Dharma
to honour rpists
get the Mahapanchayat to support the l!nching accused
create apps to auction women
I want to challenge these degenerates
Show even one Shloka in Valmiki Ramayana
which validates this hatred
But these people will accept the challenge only if
they know how to read and write
Thats why I would say friends  that the wise Hindus need to unite
and raise our voices against them
so that we can save Ram from Nathuram
So that no one can fool you in the name of religion
read the religious scriptures yourself
I am putting the link to the entire  Valmikis Ramayana in the description below
And when you get time read it
and see what values are taught in it
Jai Jai Ram Jai Siya Ram!
If you liked the video click here  to watch the previous video of Ramayana
Every year on 1st February
the countrys budget is announced  by the countrys finance minister
In which we get to know
how much money does the government earn
how much is spent in different places
for the welfare of the people
As usual this year too on 1st February
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman
presented the Union Budget 2024
But the difference was that this years budget
was an Interim Budget
I commend the Interim Budget
to this August House
Jai Hind!
It is a temporary budget
that will only give estimates for the entire year
This is because this year
the Lok Sabha elections will take place
After the elections once the  new government is formed
the full budget will be presented in July
This is done every time it is an election year
but this does not mean that
the interim budget is not crucial
This tells us how the government  will spend money during the next few months
And we will also get to know the overall  strategy and direction of the government
So come lets understand in this video
whats in this new budget for you
the common people
and the promises made in the previous budgets
as well as the expenses
how much of it was achieved
and what were their results
Similar to the last year
the main focus area of the government in the budget
was Capital Expenditure
In short it is also called CAPEX
It refers to the money that the  government spends on longterm assets
Large infrastructure projects in the economy
like making roads railways ports
largescale buildings or bridges
Last year the government had already  increased this expenditure a lot by 33
and allocated 10 trillion
The data shows that
although the government had not  spent the entire 10 trillion last year
the actual spending was still 95 trillion
But this year it has been increased further by 111
the government plans to spend 1111 trillion this year
The reason behind this is very simple
The government says that if money is spent on these avenues
then it boosts economic growth
and lead to employment creation
People get jobs when such big bridges  roads and ports are built
The Finance Minister said that in the last 4 years
the capital expenditure has increased by 3 times
For railways specifically
255 trillion have been allocated
and 3 new corridors have been announced
Energy Mineral and Cement Corridor
Port Connectivity Corridor
and High Traffic Density Corridor
The Finance Minister has also said that
more than 40000 normal rail coaches
will be converted to Vande Bharat standards
Forty thousand normal rail bogies
will be converted to the Vande Bharat standards
This years railways allocation
is much higher than last years 241 trillion
While last year we had already seen an increase of 1 trillion
This is good news
but hopefully its impact
will be seen on the ground in railway safety as well
Because last year there were many accidents
On 29th October the train collision in Andhra Pradesh
On 11th October Bihar North East Express derailment
On 26th September Mathura EMU train derailment
And in June 2023 we witnessed the train collision in Odisha
which was one of the most dangerous  accidents in the history of the nation
Almost 300 people lost their lives in this accident
In India where at least 260 people have been k!lled
in a train crash in the eastern state of Odisha
Its already the countrys worst train crash this century
In the agriculture sector
the goverment has announced
Atmanirbhar Oil Seeds Abhiyan
and focused on fertilisers like NanoDAP
NanoDAP stands for
Nano DiAmmonium Phosphate
A type of ecofriendly fertiliser
with 8 nitrogen and 16 phosphorous
This is very useful for Green Farming
Thats why it is being promoted
On the other hand in the Oil Seeds Initiative
the government has said that
they want to cut the imports from outside the country
They want to cut down edible oil  imports from 60 to 30
So that India can become selfreliant in  seeds like mustard groundnut soybean sunflower
But the subsidies that are given for fertilizers
saw a budget cut
In comparison to the 189 trillion from last year
only 164 trillion has been allocated this year
Food subsidies have also been cut
Last years budget allocation was 212 trillion
This year it has been reduced to 205 trillion
In the education and healthcare sectors
we got some bad news
The government had already cut  the education budget last year
But the amount that the government  had promised to spend last year
they didnt even spent that their spending was lower than that
In last years budget the government  promised to spend 116 trillion on education
But according to the revised budget estimates
the government will be able to spend only 108 trillion
This year there is a small increase in the education budget
Instead of 116 trillion
the government has now allocated 125 trillion
On top of that in the education sector
big budget cuts have been made in many places
For example the budget allocated to UGC  the University Grants Commission
has been cut by 60
Last years revised estimate was 6409 billion
This year they were given only 25 billion
The budget allocated to IITs and IIMs  has also been decreased this year
Instead of 10384 billion
10324 billion for IITs
Instead of 3 billion for IIMs last year
only 212 billion have been allocated this year
But where has this budget increased in education?
More money is being spent on central universities
Instead of the 115 billion last year
150 billion have been allocated this year
The amount spent on research  and innovation has been increased
Instead of 2 billion last year
this year 355 billion has been allocated
In the healthcare sector last year the government
had allocated 890 billion
But according to revised estimates
only 790 billion will be spent
This year a small increase has been seen
Instead of 890 billion
the government has allocated 900 billion
Here two initiatives have been  announced by the government
First the Ayushman Bharat scheme will be expanded
and second they have focused  on the cervical cancer vaccine too
After this we come to housing
where the Prime Minister Awas scheme is underway
To give affordable housing to the poor
Its allocation has been increased
Instead of the 79590 billion last year
80671 billion have been allocated this year
Under this scheme the government has also said that
they will launch a new scheme for  the deserving sections of the middle class
Those who live in rented houses
slums or unauthorized colonies
will be given the opportunity to  build and buy their own houses
If we talk about the overall economy
Indias real GDP growth rate
which is projected for 20232024
will be at 73
There are two types of GDPs friends
One is the Nominal GDP  and the other is the Real GDP
Nominal GDP shows the size of the  economy according to todays prices
But in real GDP we take inflation into account
For example if the nominal GDP  growth rate of a country is 15
but the inflation rate in the country is 10
then the real GDP growth rate will be
15  10  5
But in 202223 Indias actual Nominal GDP growth rate
is 105
And our inflation is approximately 4 per cent
So the real GDP growth rate is 65
This is a bit low because
in December 2023 RBI had raised its projections
and said that Indias GDP growth rate would be around 7
But today this is near 65
If we look at the estimates of international  agencies for Indias GDP growth rate
they are in the similar range
In October 2023 the IMF projected  Indias growth rate to be 63
And for 202425 World Bank has projected 64
OECD has projected 61
and ADB has projected 67
IMF has also projected that India
will become the thirdlargest economy by 2027
It is very interesting to see
how different agencies identify patterns in data
and predict the growth of a country
Data scientists are often tasked with this work
And this is the reason why today data science
is one of the most lucrative career options
Data and the conclusions from data
have a huge impact on different industries
The figures for GDP growth rate are so important that
it can cause the market to go up or crash

Now lets get back to the video
Next we come to the second  biggest focus area of this budget
that is reducing the fiscal deficit
The Fiscal Deficit is the difference between  the governments revenue and expenditure
The amount spent by the government
and the revenue it earns
the difference between the two
And since the word Deficit is being used here
it means that compared to the revenue of the government
they are spending more than that
For this year Indias Fiscal Deficit is estimated to be
1786 trillion
But we usually look at the Fiscal Deficit  as a percentage of GDP
Last year the government had set a target that
it should be 59 of GDP this year
And revised estimates show that
not only has the government achieved its target
but they have brought it down to 58
In this years budget the Fiscal Deficit target  for 20242025 is set at 51 of GDP
This is lower than before which is a good thing
In fact in 2003 the government had passed an Act
the Fiscal Responsibility  and Budget Management Act 2003
According to this Act
the governments target should be
to keep the fiscal deficit at only 3 of nominal GDP
But since then there has been only one year
around 200708
where the government was able to meet this target
Since the last few years the government
is slowly reducing it so that
it can be brought down to that range
And for the Financial Year 2026
the target is set at 45
Whatever money the government earns
onethird of it
is spent on interest servicing
Interest Servicing refers to the interest payments  of the loan taken by the government
Both domestic and international  borrowings are included in this
Whether the government has borrowed  money from within the country
or from outside the country
In total this year the government will
spend 119 trillion on Interest Servicing
This number has increased by 135 trillion  in comparison to last year
In this table you can see the major expenses
of the government based on this years budget
And it has been compared to
the revised budget estimates of last year
If we talk about taxes
there is nothing for the common people in this budget
because nothing has changed  in comparison to last year
The income tax slabs are still there
But another interesting thing to see here is that
which taxes generate the most revenue for the government?
Budget documents show that in FY 2025
the government will earn 19 of its revenue
from taxes collected under the Income Tax
On the second number is GST with 18
The government will earn 18 of its  revenue from the taxes collected under GST
And then comes the Corporate Tax at 17
This shows that the biggest  contribution to the governments revenue
is that of the Income Tax payers
And the GST payers
And the contribution of the Corporate  Tax paid by the companies
is lower than these
However the bigger source of income for the government
is still borrowing
Borrowing money is at 28
The Finance Minister has put a tagline for this budget
Viksit Bharat by 2047 Developed India by 2047
And she has also promised that
India will become a developed nation by 2047
And also that by 2030
India will become a 7 trillion dollar economy
As per the latest report by the Finance Ministry
the Indian economy can of course
hit the and can aspire to hit the 7 trillion mark by 2030
It sounds good to hear
but the reality is revealed only when
you compare these promises
with the promises made in the previous years
In the 2019 Niti Aayog meeting PM Modi said that
he will make India a 5 trillion economy by 2024
2024 is here
forget about the 5 trillion economy
India is not even a 4 trillion economy yet
The current status of India is a 37 trillion economy
Had the government wanted
they could have come up with a new  deadline for the 5 trillion economy promise
Even though it didnt happen by 2024
they could have made 2026 or 2027 the new deadline
but then people would have remembered that
they had already talked about  the 5 trillion economy previously
Instead the government decided that
this number should be pushed one step further
and now they are promising  a 7 trillion economy by 2030
By the way I would also like to remind you that
around 201718
they were talking about a New India by 2022
In 2022 Indias 75 years of independence was completed
So the government made it a deadline
And PM Modi had promised that
every person every citizen
will have a home to live peacefully by 2022
It was also said that by 2022
farmers income will be doubled
and there will be bullet trains in India
This deadline has been pending for 2 years
Mark my works when India will actually  become a 5 trillion economy
which will definitely happen someday no doubt about it
because theres GDP growth
Then youll see how it will be  presented as a new achievement
The Finance Minister focused on  4 main sections of society in the budget
Poor people women youth  and the ones who feed us the farmers
She said that their welfare
is the governments highest priority
Only when they progress
will the country progress
Its absolutely correct
But the reality is that
Indias ranking in the Hunger Index is falling
Today Indias ranking is 111 out of 125 on the Hunger Index
which reveals the widespread hunger in the country
Youth Unemployment is at 45
for the ages of 2024
Womens labour participation in Indias workforce
has been falling for the past few years
In 2005 it used to be 32
In 2021 it was only 19
And here the middle class is facing  more and more difficulties
This chart shows that between 2016 and 2021
the increase and decrease in household  income across various sections in India
The richest 20 of the population of the country
their income has increased by a good 40
And the upper middle class got some benefits too
But the actual middle class lower middle  class and the poor people of the country
have seen only losses in the last few years
Their income has decreased
And the worst impact of it
has been on the poorest 20 of the people
This data was published by  Indias Consumer Economy 360 survey
The unfortunate thing is that
it is becoming increasingly difficult to access  such data in the country with each day
Because the government simply does not  disclose the uncomfortable data to the public
At the bottom of this chart it is written that
Official public data on
Indian income and consumption inequality
has become very hard or impossible
to be obtained in recent years
Look at this article from 27th March
the Union government has no data
on Indias offshore shell companies
Neither does the government have data on
how many farmers were k!lled in the farmers protests
Nor does it have data on how many  migrants faced difficulties during COVID
Nor does it have data on how many  people were k!lled in mob lynching
nor the data on how many MSMEs  had to be shut down during lockdown
This is why opposition leaders  have often mocked the government
saying that NDA means No Data Available
And the things for which  theres some kind of data available
its impossible to know
which data to trust
While announcing this budget the Finance Minister said that
in the last 10 years the government has
assisted 250 million people to get  freedom from multidimensional poverty
In these 10 years
the Government has assisted
25 crore people  250 million people
to get freedom from multidimensional poverty
But last year in December Amit Shah had said that
the Modi government had
help 600 million people to be free from poverty
So is the 250 million number correct?
Or the 600 million?
No idea
Anyways coming back to the budget
this was the story of this years Interim Budget
We will get to know the rest of the details
when the full budget is presented in July

On 4th January 2024
on his social media handles  Prime Minister Modi
posted some pictures from Lakshadweep
Although there was no  mention of Maldives in these pictures
some politicians in the Maldivian government
reacted to these pictures in a way
that led to years of friendship  between the two countries
being in danger today
In a few days the situation becomes so serious that
BoycottMaldives started trending on social media
The 3 ministers of the Maldivian government
who caused the controversy are
Mariyam Shiuna
Malsha Shareef and
Abdullah Mahzoom Majid
Their comments on India and the Indian Prime Minister
look to be born out of insecurity
They believed that PM Modis agenda
was to make Lakshadweep and Maldives compete
But these comments included some personal attacks too
On Twitter Mariyam called PM Modi  a puppet of Israel
Her colleagues said that these photos from Lakshadweep
aimed at challenging the tourism industry in the Maldives
And Mahzoom Majid stereotyped Indians
and made hateful comments against India
Sharing photos of open urination he said that
it is a part of Indian culture
These led to an outright conflict on social media
When the Indians started posting that they
are cancelling their flight and hotel bookings
the Maldivian government understood the seriousness
and the Maldivian Foreign Ministry stated that
the opinions expressed by the ministers
were their personal opinions and
did not represent the views of the Maldivian government
Later the government suspended these 3 ministers
But the point isnt about  Maldives versus Lakshadweep only
Not just about this social media war
The whole controversy was driven by hateful politics
A geopolitical agenda which led to all of this
Lets understand it in todays video
One thing you all would know is that
Maldives is a small country
The total population of this country  is only around 500000 people
This country is made up of numerous islands
In fact there are more than 1000 islands
But out of these 1000 islands
only about 200 are inhabited
Where humans live
And out of these 200
more than 150 islands are resort islands
They have been sold to private companies
And those companies have their private resorts on it
Obviously the country depends heavily on tourism
28 of Maldives GDP depends on tourism
And 90 of the tax revenue for the government
comes from import duties and tourismrelated taxes
And an interesting fact is that
India is the number one country
based on the number of tourists visiting Maldives
In 2023 more than 200000 Indian tourists went to Maldives
In total approx 175 million tourists  went to Maldives this year
So you can imagine a country with a population of 500000
hosting more than 17 million tourists in a year
But the relationship between India and Maldives
is much deeper than that of tourism
For years India and Maldives have been strategic allies
and there has been military cooperation between the two too
India has played a special role in initiatives like SAGAR
SAGAR stands for
Security and Growth for All in the Region
Around 2008 India launched its Neighbourhood First Policy
and improved relations with Sri Lanka Maldives
Nepal Afghanistan Bangladesh
Pakistan and Myanmar
About 77 Indian military officers and soldiers
are present on the Maldives islands
additionally two Dhruv Advanced Light Helicopters
were donated by India to the Maldives in 2010 and 2015
There are many reasons behind this  military presence and helicopter donation
Such as helping during natural calamities
conducting search and rescue operations
airlifting medical patients between islands
But apart from this Indias warships patrol the
exclusive economic zone of the Maldives too
This is the sea area surrounding Maldives
where illegal activity is prevented
Basically to prevent terrorism
Maldives had requested India to do this
In 2009 when the Maldivian government
were concerned about potential  terrorist attacks in their country
they had asked India for help
because they did not have the capabilities  in terms of military assets and surveillance
But this help and Indias military presence
has become a major issue of controversy  in Maldives internal politics for the last few years
Some political parties in Maldives completely oppose this
and want India to withdraw its military
In fact Maldives current President Mohamed Muizzu
and his political party Peoples National Congress
used this issue during their election campaign
and came to power
The issue of India Out
To understand this better
we have to take a look at Maldives internal politics
The thing is the country was  under dictatorship for 30 years
It was only in 2008
that a new constitution was adopted
and a multiparty democracy system  was established in their country
The elections that were conducted in 2008
was won by the Maldivian  Democratic Party or MDP in short
and their new President was Mohamed Nasheed
He was a successful president for the first 4 years of his term
He spread awareness on climate change issues
pledged to make Maldives carbon neutral
and his foreign policy was India First
During his term India and Maldives became close allies
And as I said in 2009 on his request
India donated military equipment to Maldives
But in 2012 a political crisis broke out in Maldives
And the next year in 2013  when elections took place
a new party came to power
The Progressive Party of Maldives or PPM
The President was Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom
And with the change in the governing party
the foreign policy of the country also changed
This new party opposed India
In 2016 their new government stated that
India can take back the  2 helicopters that were gifted to them
After distancing themselves from India
Yameens government got closer to China
Chinese companies were given contracts for
major infrastructure projects in the Maldivian islands
And in the meantime  Maldives became a part of
Chinas Belt and Road Initiative
Under this initiative China wants to spend money
on large infrastructure projects
in different countries across the world
by building roads railways and ports
to increase its influence in Asia Africa and Europe
Most of the loan terms of Chinese contracts
were quite unsustainable
Because of this many countries fall into Chinas debt trap
During this time Maldives borrowed  15 Billion from China
Friends here Id like to say that
if you couldnt understand any part in my video
you can use ChatGPT as an assistant
What is Chinas Belt and Road Initiative?
You can simply ask this
It can explain in simple terms why many countries are deep in debt
And not only in English ChatGPT can
answer your questions in Hindi or Hinglish too
Similarly for many such tasks
ChatGPT is a useful software
This is why I made a 45hourlong  course to master ChatGPT

Because of this government
relations between India and Maldives got weaker
and Indias strategic position in this area starts weakening
After this the next election was in 2018
once again the governing party changed
and so did the foreign policy of the country
In 2018 Ibrahim Mohamed Solih from MDP
became the President
And the first thing he did was
the Indian helicopters that Yameen wanted to send back
Solih extended the contract of those Indian helicopters
He wanted to keep those helicopters in Maldives
Once again they adopted India First strategy
Thereafter India helps the Maldivian government
India provides billions of dollars to Maldives
so that they could repay the loan
taken by the previous government
Even during the Covid pandemic
India provided vaccines in Maldives
One thing to note here is that
even when Maldives wasnt a democracy
during the 30year dictatorship
IndiaMaldives relations were still strong
Like in 1995 India built
Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Maldives
It is still the largest hospital in Maldives
Back to 2020
this new MDP government
was extremely enthusiastic about  the India First sentiment
Many bilateral agreements were signed
between India and Maldives during this time
India granted 500 million for maritime connectivity
A Line of Credit of 800 million  was given by ExportImport Bank of India
Due to this India Firsts proactive approach
an undercurrent was spreading across the country
The sentiment of India Out
The politicians in the opposition had a
negative outlook towards the alliance between
the Indian government and the Maldivian government
By 2021 many journalists had written articles about it
numerous posts had been made on social media
which were openly criticising India
and in many ways degrading India
Politicians were also giving hateful speeches
to end Indias presence from their islands
Seeing all this the Indian High Commission in Maldives
wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Maldives
stating that the articles and social media posts
were attacking Indian dignity
They asked the ministry to do something about them
This letter was leaked to Maldives media
On 2nd July 2021 the MDP government
officially apologises to India
And expresses concern that
some people who are spreading hatred against India
on Maldivian media and social media
Acknowledging it as wrong
Here a local news publication DRS was mentioned
with their cofounder Ahmed Azaan
Specifically pointing out that
they are the people spreading AntiIndia hate
Regarding India Out slogans Ahmed Azaan gave a statement
that the campaign does not mean that they  want to expel the Indians from Maldives
They do want Indians to be safe in their country
And that the India Out movement means that
they want to expel the Indian military from their country
And that the people using the India Out campaign
to threaten the Indians
and to attack Indians
are in the wrong
He called it an issuebased movement
So the point is
if this is an issuebased movement
then what are their issues?
The opposition politicians claim that
the agreements entered into by the MDP government with India
are very confidential
and their details are not revealed to the public
The then Vice President of their opposition party PPM
Mohd Shareef said that
if the details of the agreement
are not presented to the country
it is a violation of democracy
The government should not hide the details  by citing the excuse of national security
He used the example of the Harbour project
on the Uthura Thila Falhu Island in Maldives
A joint defence action plan was signed
between India and Maldives in February 2021
where Indias job was to develop and
maintain the harbour of this coast guard
Leaked documents suggest that
according to this agreement
the Indian military could stay here for decades
and they would have the exclusive rights to this facility
Many Maldivian citizens were  genuinely upset after hearing this
Even those who were not  supporting the India Out campaign
started supporting the opposition
And because of this when the next  elections were conducted in 2023
the governing party changed again
and the PPM party that was the opposition
came back into power
This time this PPM party
formed an alliance with PNC party to be in power
And the latest President of Maldives
Mohamed Muizzu
was the candidate of this rightwing party PNC
This happened on 30th September 2023
This political party which focused on the  India Out issue during their election campaign
is in power today
It is also worth noting that
had the previous MDP government been more transparent
and had not kept the agreements so confidential
then perhaps the India Out sentiment
would not have gained so much traction
And perhaps they could have remained in power
But now since this PPM party came into power
they took this India Out issue  even more seriously than last time
Their new president Mohamed Muizzu
openly stated four days after winning the election
that Indian forces in Maldives
will have to leave the country
On 17th November 2023  he became the President officially
and only a week later
on 23rd November
he met Indian Union Minister Kiren Rijiju
He repeated the same points in the meeting
that India withdraw its military personnel from Maldives
And it was only a month and a half later
that the Muizzus ministers
openly started insulting PM Modi and India
on public platform
When this happened the exPresidents of Maldives
and the MDP party
obviously stood up in favour of India
Mohamed Nasheed and Ibrahim Mohamed Solih
both condemned this hateful language against India
Now that you know these you can understand
that it was never about Lakshadweep
This was entirely about Maldives internal politics
This India Out sentiment
is a way for some Maldivian politicians
to incite their citizens
and to score more votes with their hateful speeches
In 2021 when the MDP government was in power  and India Out slogans were raised
then one of the MDP ministers Ali Azim had said that
this antiIndia movement was
happening because some people
enjoy making hateful speeches
Today this is a great example of how
hateful politics can be harmful to a country
You will find such politicians not only in Maldives
but in every country in the world
They either spread hatred against a community
against a religion
or against another country
Whats unfortunate is that
many people get misled by such  hateful speeches and the fear they create
If we look at the foreign policy of the new Maldivian government
it is once again leaning towards China
Maybe its just a coincidence that
this entire controversy started just a day before
the Maldivian Presidents visit to China
His trip to China was from 8th to 12th January
The Chinese statesponsored media
praised this situation stating that
it demonstrates that Muizzu is treating  India with a normal mindset
and steering the relationship between Maldives and India
to a normal statestate relationship
It is also historic that
Muizzu chose China for his first foreign trip
All the Maldivian presidents before him
came to India on their first foreign trip
Just two days ago on 10th January
after this controversy began
President Muizzu extended an  invitation to Chinese tourists
to visit Maldives
Since Indians started boycotting the country
he is openly inviting Chinese tourists to his country
So the entire issue here  is about Maldives internal politics
The parties in favour of China
versus the parties in favour of India
This also reveals that
if the governing party changes once again in Maldives in 45 years
and the proIndia party comes to power
then Indias stance towards Maldives can change again
The boycott Maldives slogans that are trending now
can turn into Go to Maldives slogans
after a few years
But regardless of what happens in Maldives politics
we can always promote Indian tourism
One thing that we need to be cautious about is that
while promoting local tourism
the local biodiversity and the local  population should also be cared for
Tourism should not be at the cost of  environment and the livelihoods of the locals
If you liked this video you will  like this video on geopolitics too
in which I have talked about how  countries all over the world
promote the weapons industry
And why the United Nations fails in such cases
Picture yourself on a ship at sea
relishing the fresh and invigorating sea breeze
Suddenly a remarkable sight unfolds before you
a colossal missile emerges from the water
Not just any missile
but a nuclear missile
with the capability to reach a target  on the other side of the globe
spanning thousands of kilometers
This isnt a mere imagination
its a reality today thanks to submarines
The footage you just witnessed
was a test of a Trident 2 missile  conducted by the US Navy
launched from a US Ohioclass submarine
The Trident 2 falls under the category of
submarinelaunched ballistic missiles SLBMs
representing one of the most formidable weapons globally
These SLBMs boast an estimated yield of 475 kilotons
a stark contrast to the 1213 kiloton yield of  the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima
Presently these potent weapons
are housed within submarines
stealthily traversing the worlds oceans
in highly classified undisclosed locations
In todays video lets delve into  the intricacies of these submarines
understanding the technology that propels them
and unravelling their operational mechanisms
Fundamentally all submarines operate based on
Archimedes principle
a concept likely familiar from school
As an object sinks
it experiences a buoyant force
equivalent to the weight of the fluid displaced
due to this objects sinking
When a submarines weight  matches that of the water it displaces
it achieves a level of neutral buoyancy
Allowing it to maintain a constant depth
When the objective is to submerge
the gravitational force applied must exceed
the buoyant force
prompting the use of ballast tanks
Typically these two tanks are located at the submarines ends
they are filled with air at the surface
enabling the vessel to float
To descend into the water
these ballast tanks are flooded with water
increasing the submarines weight
and initiating the descent
Such scenarios are labelled to have negative buoyancy
It indicates the control of a submarines depth
by adjusting the water level in its ballast tanks
This mechanism governs vertical  movement for ascending and descending
For lateral movement  such as turning sideways in the water
a Rudder is employed
It looks like this
It is known as a Vertical Rudder
This facilitates horizontal movement in the water
Similar rudders are used in boats ships and aircraft
Additionally forward and backward motion  is achieved through the use of a propeller
essentially a fan
While navigating underwater
a reliable means of orientation is essential
Sonar technology serves this purpose
It operates based on sound
There are two main types of sonar technologies
active sonar and passive sonar
Active sonar involves emitting sound from the submarine
The sound travels through the water
collides with objects and upon  reflection back to the submarine
the time and distance calculations
provide information about the submarines  location and the surrounding environment
In contrast passive sonar does not emit sound
but rather detects sounds from other  sources such as enemy submarines
by listening to their engine and propeller noises
to determine their distance
However the use of sonar technology  has adverse effects on marine life
impacting creatures like whales and dolphins
which also rely on sonar for communication
To address this concern some submarines  are exploring alternative technologies
such as LiDAR
Light Detection and Ranging
LiDAR employs light to estimate distance
and is already integrated into many modern smartphones
Another alternative is using RADAR
Radio Detection and Ranging
it is effective above water and in aircrafts
which utilizes radio waves to calculate distances
but is limited underwater due to the  restricted transmission of radio waves
Lastly emerging technologies are being  explored as potential alternatives like
MRS  Magnetic Anomaly Detection System
or Gravitational Anomaly Detection System
However the bottom line is that today
the predominant technology employed  in submarines is Sonar
Multiple Sonar sensors are strategically  installed around submarines
to continuously collect and monitor data
ensuring there are no obstacles or hazards in their path
This underscores the vital role of data science
whether in space on ground or underwater
it is a necessity in almost every domain
Unsurprisingly data science has emerged  as one of the most lucrative career options

Now lets delve into the inner workings of a submarine
Typically an armed military submarine  consists of three levels or decks
This video will mostly focus on military submarines
as they constitute the majority of submarines worldwide
Its worth noting that the designs of  research and tourism submarines may differ
For instance the Titan submersible gained attention a few months ago
due to its accident
and Ive covered it in a separate video if youre interested in learning more
If youre interested you can check out the  detailed video
The link is in the description
Now turning our attention to military submarines
The topmost deck of a military submarine  is typically outfitted with torpedoes
which serve as weapons
The lowest deck houses battery rooms
that supply electricity to the submarine
and sandwiched in between are the diesel machine
motor room and the nerve center  known as the control room
Positioned above the control room  youll usually find a conning tower
an essential component serving as  the submarines attack center
The conning tower is equipped with various instruments
including periscopes for observing the surroundings
electronic antennas and access points for arms
It also serves as the main entry and exit point
for individuals entering or leaving the submarine
Torpedoes are stored in torpedo tubes
These are basically selfpropelled underwater missiles
These tubes are cylindrical containers  designed to house these cylindrical missiles
In modern submarines torpedoes  are typically placed at the front
However in the 2017 Bollywood film Ghazi Attack
the depiction of a submarine featured  torpedoes at both the front and back
This was historically accurate as powerful submarines back then
indeed had torpedoes at both ends
because torpedoes could only travel  in a straight line at the time
An intriguing aspect is that
these torpedo tubes can also be used as  emergency escape routes from submarines
Nevertheless escaping through them is no easy feat
The tubes have a narrow diameter  measuring only 1275 inches for light torpedoes
and 21 inches for heavy torpedoes
First of all this is an extremely narrow space
Additionally individuals attempting to escape  must wear a 23 kg escape
suit due to the immense water pressure at those depths
One cant simply exit the submarine at those depths
The immense pressure of the water  would crush the unprepared instantly
Officers working in submarines
undergo rigorous training for six months
Indias sole military submarine training establishment
INS Satavahana  is located in Vishakhapatnam city
At this training facility numerous replicas  of torpedo tubes are available
for officers to practice emergency escapes
Now lets delve into the submarines power source
where does it get the energy to operate?
The answer depends on the type of submarine
with two primary categories in India
conventional submarines and nuclear submarines
Conventional submarines utilize large electrical batteries
akin to car batteries but these  require recharging every 23 days
To recharge these batteries
a diesel engine is needed
However operating a diesel engine
necessitates oxygen from the air
Since submarines operate underwater
they must resurface to run the  diesel engine and recharge the batteries
In contrast nuclear submarines dont have this problem
They employ a nuclear reactor instead  of a diesel engine to generate electricity
This allows them to remain submerged for extended periods
limited only by the human factors
such as the availability of food  and provisions for the crew
The submarines can remained submerged  as long as theres sufficient provisions for the crew
Examining the structure of a submarine
the outer layer is typically composed of rubber
This reason for strategic choice is quite simple actually
Because rubber effectively absorbs sound
making it challenging to detect submarines in the water
Military submarines are designed to be elusive
ensuring they are not easily spotted by enemy counterparts
The black layer visible in submarine photos
is made of rubber
Moving to the interior the primary body  of the submarine within the rubber layer
is referred to as the Hull
There are two common types of hulls
single hull and double hull
Single hull submarines have only one layer of the main body
while double hull submarines consist of two layers of the main body
In the double hull design
the ballast tank is integrated
with water filling the space between the two layers
effectively serving as a ballast tank
The clear advantage of a double hull configuration
lies in providing an additional layer of protection
In the event of a collision
a double hull submarine offers enhanced security
Most modern military submarines
adopt the double hull design
not only for added protection  but also to better withstand water pressure
as illustrated by the incident involving the Titan submersibles
implosion under water pressure
At the waters surface the atmospheric pressure is 1 atmosphere
equivalent to 1 kilogram per square centimeter
As one descends underwater pressure increases
For every 10 meters of depth
theres an additional 1 kilogram per square meter of pressure
Military submarines are typically designed  to operate at depths of 300400 meters
with some capable of reaching depths of 500 meters
At this depth the pressure reaches 50 atmospheres
50 times greater than at the surface
Obviously constructing submarine  hulls requires robust materials
Not using the right materials
might cause failures or accidents
As with the Titan submersible
Military submarines use highquality steel alloys
blending steel with titanium carbon  aluminium and other elements
The complexity of designing a submarine is underscored
by the fact that it takes approximately  10 years to design a dieselelectric submarine
while a nuclear submarine demands a  minimum of 1517 years at the designing stage
This intricacy is why India often outsources submarine design
to other countries such as Russia Germany or France
However India manufactures its own submarines
Indias first domestically manufactured  submarine was INS Shalki
launched in 1987 during  Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhis tenure
and commissioned by the Indian Navy in 1992
On Indian Navys website you will see that
there are different categories of submarines
which are divided into classes
In India there are four classes
Sindhughosh Shishumar Kalvari and Arihant
The first three classes
are of conventional submarines
the Sindhughosh class comprises Russian dieselpowered EKMs
the Shishumar class features German SSKs
and the Kalvari class showcases new Frenchdesigned and Indianbuilt SCORPENEs
Here EKMs SSKs and SCORPENEs
are the nomenclature used for submarines in other countries
But we classify these submarines into these classes
These classes of submarines
can be compared to the models of cars
Specifically Sindhughosh comprises 7 submarines
Shishumar has 4
and the Kalvari class has 5 operational submarines
Detailed information about each submarine  including names can be found on the Indian Navy website
and the link is provided in the description below
Moving to the category of nuclear submarines
India has named its class Arihant
Currently there are two active nuclear submarines in this class
with two more under construction in Vishakhapatnam
The Arihantclass submarines have the  capability to carry ballistic missiles
Ballistic missiles are selfguided missiles
that can be equipped with nuclear bombs
INS Arihant is presently armed with  K15 submarinelaunched ballistic missile
an SLBM like the one I mentioned earlier in the video
The range of the K15 missile is  between 750 km and 1900 km
Talking about the other developed countries
the American Navys Ohioclass submarines
are considered among the most powerful in the world
The US possesses a total of 18 Ohioclass submarines
each capable of carrying 24 Trident 2 ballistic missiles
Furthermore each Trident 2 missile can  potentially accommodate 14 nuclear bombs
When the United States and Russia
aimed to decrease the number of nuclear weapons they had
they entered into the START 1 agreement
The terms of the agreement specified  a reduction limit from 14 to 8
This START I treaty officially known  as the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
was the first treaty between the US and the Soviet Union
to reduce strategic nuclear weapons
Beyond these the US Navy features other submarine classes
such as Los Angeles Columbia and Virginia classes
In Russia the Yasen class stands out as the  most powerful nuclear attack submarine
Besides India Russia and the US other countries like
China the UK France and Germany  also possess similar submarines
The actual capacity of these submarines in terms of personnel
varies between submarines
and the actual data is confidential in these countries
due to military reasons
The estimated capacity of a submarine  generally ranges between 50 and 80 people
50 to 80 people can be onboard these submaries
With nuclear submarines being even larger
it can accommodate approximately 100 individuals
The size of these submarines is truly  remarkable as depicted in the video
Its unbelievable
For those eager to witness these marvels in person
a visit to Vishakhapatnam home to a  submarine museum is recommended
The museum features INS Kursura  a retired Indian Navy submarine
commissioned in 1969
Notably the museum was inaugurated in 2002
by the then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh
Mr Chandra Babu Naidu
If you desire the firsthand experience  of being inside a submarine
tourism submarines or research  submarines offer such opportunities
Typically nonmilitary submarines do not  venture too deep into the water
The Titan submersible was an exception
Such deepsea submarines are  rare in the tourism sector
A few companies in Europe the USA and the UK
provide submarine and submersible dives
Such as the companies Atlantis and Seabourn
They offer expeditions to locations like Alaska
I trust youve gained valuable insights from this video

Its a truly heartwrenching story
After 2011 its time for India  to host the Cricket World Cup again
And I hope that we win again  just like we did last year
Because till now the Indian  cricket team has been in great form
India has been dominating the World Cup with a series of impressive victories
leaving no other team in serious contention
In this World Cup the Indian  cricket team broke several records
In the match against Sri Lanka the team  achieved the historic victory in World Cup history
bowling out the opposition with just 55 runs
And winning with a massive 302run lead
Mohammad Shammi set the record for  the most 5wicket hauls in World Cups
and becoming Indias most  successful bowler in World Cup history
with 45 wickets in just 14 matches
The previous record was held by Zahir Khan with 44 wickets in 23 matches
In the recent semifinal match  he went on to break more records
His standout performance included 7 wickets and 57 runs
marking the best individual performance  by an Indian in ODI cricket history
Additionally he became the fastest bowler
to reach a 50wicket haul in just 17 innings
On the batting front our top star batsmen Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli
accumulated nearly 1300 runs together
Rohit Sharma scored a century
while Kohli scored 3
Virat Kohli broke many records too
He has now surpassed 50 ODI centuries
The only batsman in history to beat this record
The previous record was held by  Sachin Tendulkar at 49 ODI centuries
Additionally he broke another record held by Sachin
Most runs made by any batsman in a World Cup
In the 2003 World Cup Sachin Tendulkar set the record at 673 runs
And Kohli has already scored 711 runs in this World Cup edition
Beyond India the World Cup has seen other interesting records
including two highest runscoring matches in this World Cup
The first in the Sri Lanka v South Africa game
With a total of 754 runs
And the Australia v New Zealand game
with 771 runs
And the historic match between Australia and Afghanistan
In which Glenn Maxwell broke multiple records
Scoring 201 runs on 128 balls not out
becoming the first nonopening batsman
to achieve a double century
His partnership with the captain of the Australian team
became the highest 8th wicket partnership
in the history of ODI cricket
Australia had nearly lost the game
at one point they were playing at 917
Glenn Maxwell singlehandedly delivered Australia from their precarious score
and had the team qualify for the World Cup semifinals
Even though Afghanistan lost the match they had almost won
Afghanistans story stands out as  one of the most intriguing in this World Cup
defeating three former World Cupwinning teams
England Pakistan and Sri Lanka
Despite this being only the third time
that Afghanistan was participating in the World Cup
And the previous two times that Afghanistan had played
They had won only a single match in both World Cups combined
That was against Scotland in 2015
How could Afghanistans team accomplish this out of nowhere?
What is the reason behind the increasing popularity of cricket in Afghanistan?
What is the link between geopolitics and cricket?
Come lets discuss some unheard stories in this video
Today cricket is the second most popular sport after football
with an estimated 25 billion followers
While around 35 billion people are football fans
This number is significant  not merely due to Indias large population
as the cricket fan base is nearly double that of the Indian population
and not every Indian is a cricket enthusiast
The roots of crickets popularity can  be traced back to the British Empire
International cricket has been governed by the International Cricket Council ICC
since its establishment in 1909
Presently 12 countries are full members of the ICC
The 12 full ICC members are England Australia
South Africa West Indies New Zealand
India Pakistan Sri Lanka
Zimbabwe Bangladesh Ireland and Afghanistan
These countries share a history of colonization by the British
contributing to the widespread popularity of cricket in these nations
Afghanistan stands out as an exception to some extent
a topic we will delve into later in the video
The 12 full members of the ICC
are the exclusive participants in Test cricket
and the 10 teams participating in the ongoing World Cup
are from these 12
excluding Netherlands
Unfortunately West Indies Zimbabwe and Ireland
failed to qualify for this years World Cup
with Netherlands securing a spot instead
The Netherlands is an associate member of the ICC
The category of associate members is a tier below full membership
There are a total of 94 associate member countries in the ICC
The question arises how did cricket gain popularity in the Netherlands
a country untouched by British colonisation?
The Netherlands is a European country
There are two major reasons for this
First the proximity to England
with the British introducing cricket to the Netherlands in the early days
The British citizens who had moved to the Netherlands
And then the elite Dutch people  those from the upper class
among them crickets popularity grew
The second reason is that the Netherlands  had colonised some Caribbean countries
such as Suriname
when immigrants from those regions moved to the Netherlands postWorld War II
further fueled crickets popularity there
However its essential to note that
games like football and field hockey  are more popular than cricket in the Netherlands
Although their team did qualify for the World Cup
but cricket is not very popular in the Netherlands
Shifting our focus to India 1721 was the year
when the first recorded cricket match took place
This match was played by sailors of the  East India Company in Khambath Gujarat
Cricket reached Australia by the late 1700s
while New Zealand and South Africa saw its advent
only during the early 1800s
Ironically while England propagated cricket to so many countries
many colonized nations
won the Cricket World Cup before England
With the West Indies securing the title  in the first cricket World Cup held in 1975
and also in 1979
And it was in the third World Cup  that India claimed its victory in 1983
Countries like Australia Pakistan and Sri Lanka  have won the World Cup at least once
But it was only in 2019
that England won the World Cup trophy for the first time

And now lets get back to our topic
The memorable 2019 Cricket World Cup final match
most cricket fans would still remember this
it was so thrilling
And Englands win in the Super Over
was quite controversial
Because technically even the Super Over culminated in a tie
In this match between England and New Zealand
both teams had scored 15 runs in the Super Over
According to the rules since the Super Over was a tie
the team that scored more boundaries in the match
was declared the winner of the match
And in this years World Cup England was the fourthworst team
England could win only 3 out of the 9 matches it played
Afghanistans cricket team ranked  higher than England boasting four wins
This is the intriguing story of the Afghanistan cricket team
Some years ago in 2007
when India won the T20 Cricket World Cup
the ICC classified Afghanistan in the lowest division
Division 5
This was the worst division of ICCs associate members
However the tide turned for Afghanistan with  the rising popularity of T20 cricket that year
In September 2007 after India won the first T20 World Cup
the next month the Asian Cricket Council organized its T20 Cup
featuring 10 Asian associate teams
Hong Kong Kuwait Malaysia
Nepal Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia
Singapore the UAE and Afghanistan
Afghanistan won three out of four groupstage games
defeated the UAE in the semifinals
and played the finals against Oman
In the final match both teams tied
Oman and Afghanistan shared the trophy
For the Afghan people this trophy meant a lot
This marked the first victory of the  Afghanistan cricket team in any tournament
This marked a turning point for Afghanistan
In 2008 they secured victory in the ICC World Cricket League
this was the Division 5 league
followed by triumphs in the Division 4 league in 2008
and the Division 3 league in 2009
In just six years
they qualified for their first World Cup in 2015
The journey however was arduous for the Afghanis
As I mentioned before Afghanistan is the  only exception among Britishcolonized countries
Some parts of Afghanistan were colonized by the British
during a certain period in time
but the British could not occupy the entire country
Cricket wasnt historically popular in Afghanistan
In December 1979 when the Soviet Union invaded the country
thousands of Afghanis fled towards Pakistan
It was in the refugee camps at Peshawar
that these Afghani boys encountered cricket
The people in the refugee camps saw the Pakistanis playing cricket
And they started playing too
Initially using sticks as bats
and since they had no balls
they would roll the plastic bags as balls
Some years later in 1992
Pakistan won the World Cup for the first time under the leadership of Imran Khan
This victory was an inspiration for these Afghan refugees
This is why in 2015 when Afghanistan played its first World Cup
many of the team members were from those refugee camps
Including the 2015 opening batsman Karim Sadiq
who spent his childhood in Pakistans Kacha Kara camp
There he worked in a factory at night
and played cricket in the mornings
The Afghanistan cricket team in the 2023 World Cup
can be considered the secondgeneration players
11 of the 15 players are younger than 25 years
The assistant coach Raees Ahmadzai
is a former player
recounting how he learned to play cricket as a refugee
He emphasizes that this new generation  of the Afghanistan cricket team
is the product of their training in Afghanistan
After the Soviets rule in Afghanistan ended
Taliban rose to power
This had a major impact on their cricket
Basically one can say that cricket could flourish in Afghanistan
because Taliban didnt interfere in this sport
When Taliban established their control in 1994
they banned all sports
Except cricket
Cricket was acceptable to the Taliban because
it was a noncontact sport
There was no contact between the players
and the players didnt wear shorts like they do in football
However the situation has drastically  changed during the ensuing 30 years
The national flag that is represented by Afghanistans team
and the national anthem they sing before each match
neither of them holds official status
After the 2021 Taliban take over in Afghanistan
they introduced a new national flag
this white flag
After their resurgence the conditions have only worsened
with 90 of the Afghan population living in poverty
the financial conditions are terrible
on top of it in the past 20 months
10 major earthquakes have hit Afghanistan
Thousands of people have been displaced or have lost their lives
And the most extreme earthquake hit last month on 7th October
The death toll from an earthquake in Western Afghanistan
has risen to around 320  with 1000 more injured
This is why the biggest cricket star in Afghanistan Rashid Khan
donated his entire tournament fees from  this World Cup to the earthquake victims
He says that people pray for them back home
They watch their matches hoping that they will win
Because cricket is now the only source of joy in Afghanistan
The restrictions Taliban has placed on women
and the atrocities committed by them
hardly any place on Earth is as restrictive as it is
Women are confined to their homes
and prohibited from working or studying
Thankfully Afghanistans mens cricket team has the opportunity
to participate in the World Cup
However the womens cricket team
is now refugees in Australia
they are still struggling in their pursuit of playing opportunities
Last year Rashid Khan expressed solidarity with  the daughters and sisters of Afghanistan
advocating for the reversal of the decision  to ban girls from high schools and universities
Every day of education wasted
is a day wasted from the future of the country
For Afghani cricketers cricket is not merely a sport
This is a means to fight the circumstances
Sometimes against the Soviet invasion sometimes against Talibans oppressions
The Afghani players do not hesitate to express their opinions
Last month after defeating Pakistan
the team celebrated the victory
Afghan Captain Hasmatullah Shahidi
dedicated the victory to Afghan refugees
particularly those escaping Taliban  rule and seeking refuge in Pakistan
Whom Pakistan is forcefully sending back to Afghanistan
Islamabad has ordered all undocumented immigrants
which includes around 17 million Afghan nationals
to leave the country
The game of cricket emerges as  a potential avenue for diplomatic relations
When Afghanistan attained full membership in the ICC
their inaugural test match was against India in Bangalore
The Afghanistani President Ashraf Ghani was invited to India
to watch this first test match
Similarly during the 2011 World Cup
Dr Manmohan Singh extended an invitation to  then Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani
to watch the India v Pakistan match
aiming to ease tensions between the two countries
A similar initiative occurred in 2004 when
the Indian cricket team visited Pakistan
leading both nations to relax visa regulations
allowing the public to attend matches in these countries
These instances underscore the profound impact of crickets popularity
in fostering positive relations globally
Consequently there is a need to promote this sport in other countries
encouraging both small and large  nations to take an interest in cricket
Unfortunately the current state of the sport
reveals a concentration of control in  the hands of only three major countries
with India holding the strongest influence
While the ICC theoretically comprises 12 full members
and 94 associate countries
this is just the theoritical model
The practical reality is that ICC
is controlled by the BCCI England and Wales Cricket Board ECB and Cricket Australia CA
These three nations are often referred to as the Big Three
The consolidation of power escalated after February 2014 when
the ICC implemented structural and financial reforms
granting India England and Australia nearly
complete control over crickets governance
This power shift extended to the Big Three controlling the flow of money
Out of ICCs total projected gross revenue of 25 billion
the BCCI received a significant share of 570 million or 228
England and Australia obtained 143 million and 132 million
constituting 57 and 52 shares respectively
This distribution left associate members with minimal financial support
The Big Three argued that the funds invested in  cricket development in associate countries
did not yield satisfactory returns
prompting a reduction in financial support
Fortunately in 2017 this model was repealed
and a new model was introduced
When the voting took place for the new model
13 votes were in favour and only one vote dissented
this dissenting vote was cast by the BCCI
Because under this new model
BCCIs share would be reduced from 570 million to 293 million
A share cut from 22 to 11
Concurrently associate countries were
allocated 280 million
to stimulate growth in cricket in regions where
the sport isnt very popular yet
Regrettably this model endured for only six years
This year another model was passed
granting BCCI complete financial control over international cricket
In July the ICC approved a new revenue system
where full members will receive an 888 share of revenue
between 2024 and 2027
Over the next three years ICCs earnings are expected to be
around 600 million annually
with BCCI receiving 230 million
Around 385
The associate teams would receive 11 combined
And the other full members
would get a share in the single digits
The rationale behind this new revenue system is
the same as the one in 2014
that BCCI significantly contributes commercially to cricket
Given that most advertisers and the IPL are Indiacentric
85 of commercial weightage is attributed to BCCI
This signifies that BCCIs contribution to the  cricket economy ranges from 70 to 80
Notably the biggest contributor to this cricket economy is the IPL
commonly referred to as the Cash Cow
I have separate videos on IPL and  T20 cricket you can watch them too
If you want to understand the business model of T20 model
In that video I explained how the World Cup works
In the midst of these there is positive news about crickets popularity
it will soon be included in the Olympics
This development is expected to introduce the sport to new audiences
Curiously crickets absence from the Olympics until now
can also be attributed to the BCCIs resistance
One might wonder why the BCCI opposed taking cricket to the Olympics
given that it would enhance Indias chances of winning another gold medal
The BCCIs objection has consistently centered around the fear
of losing member autonomy
in the face of the International Olympic Committee
Essentially a concern that their control over the ICC would be diluted
With the inclusion of the International Olympic Committee in the equation
Deciding match schedules and redistribution of financial costs
would no longer be within BCCIs purview
once cricket would be played in the Olympics
In the 2007 cricket World Cup
16 teams had participated
The was reduced to 14 in 2011
and further dwindled to 10 teams in 2019
Do you know why?
As fewer teams mean more matches for India
translating into increased revenue for the BCCI
Not only the BCCI the England  Cricket Board ECB supported this too
The ECB articulated concerns that if cricket  matches are held for 225 weeks in the Olympics
fewer matches would be played in England
resulting in revenue loss
However cricket has been played at the Olympics once
123 years ago
in the 1900 Paris Olympics
where only two cricket teams participated
and only one match was played
Between Great Britain and France
After this during the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur
a full ODI tournament was included
It had 16 participating teams
culminated in South Africa winning the gold medal in this tournament
Australia was in the second spot
with the silver medal
when the Australian cricket team captain Steve Waugh had said that
winning that silver medal was the highlight of his career
even though Steve Waugh had been a part of the World Cup winning team in 1987
After this in 2008 during the Beijing Olympics
he had said that if cricket is to be globalised
it would mean including countries like China and the USA
And to include them the Olympics is the fasttrack way
Australian legendary cricketer Adam Gilchrist echoed these sentiments in 2009
asserting that making cricket an Olympic sport
would encourage many countries to take the sport seriously
and play it for the first time in their history
However no one considered these appeals seriously for so long
And cricket was kept away from the Olympics
But now thankfully it is changing
In the upcoming Los Angeles Olympics in 2028
T20 cricket will finally make its Olympic debut
This significant decision is influenced by  the growing popularity of cricket in America
With the T20 World Cup scheduled to  be hosted by the United States next year
By the time cricket makes its Olympic debut
Virat Kohli will likely be 40 years old
The prospect of witnessing whether  the greatest Indian cricket right now
can secure an Olympic gold for us or not

I have explained it here
Thank you for watching!
The IsraelPalestine war began over a month ago
over 10000 lives have been lost already
Surprisingly amidst this tragedy  certain entities are benefiting significantly
American weapons manufacturers
Since the war began the stocks of these companies
have surged by 30 billion
The two major defense contractors in America
Raytheon and General Dynamics
have unabashedly informed investors
that the war in Israel  would be financially advantageous
Other arms manufacturers like  Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman
have experienced substantial  stock gains over the past three years
Lockheed Martin produces  F35 Lightning II fighter jets used by Israel
as well as Black Hawk helicopters
Northrop Grumman produces submarines and combat vehicles
Israel signed a 3 billion deal in July
to buy these F35 fighter jets
One might wonder about the source  of Israels substantial military budget
An obvious answer would be
that it is Israeli taxpayers fund
But look at this news article
In September 2016 during President Obamas tenure
the US and Israel signed a 38 billion deal
as per this deal the US provides military equipment  worth 38 billion to Israel annually
Consequently a staggering 92 of Israels imported weapons now
originate from one country
The United States of America
But why does this matter?
A country buying weapons from an ally  country would not seem suspicious
But the peculiarity of this situation is that
the weapons industry doesnt care about any alliances
The weapons industry has only one objective
earning maximum profit
This year in January the US State Department announced
a recordbreaking 205 billion in weapon sales
to various countries worldwide
in the latest fiscal year
Weapons worth more than 200 Billion  were sold in a year by only one country
Marking a 49 increase from the previous year
These weapons went to 58 different countries
including not only Israel but also
several Arab nations such as Lebanon Saudi Arabia
Qatar Kuwait the United Arab Emirates
Bahrain and Iraq
Does selling these weapons make the world a safer place?
Or unsafe?
The issue extends beyond the United States
last year Israel also set a record in weapon sales
surpassing 12 billion
This substantial figure includes sales of  drones missiles rockets and air defense systems
Notably 3 billion or the 12 billion that is 24 of this total export
was to Arab countries
Israel ranks as the 10th largest arms exporter globally
with the top four positions occupied by
the United States Russia France and China
The United Kingdom holds the 7th position
What distinguishes these five countries is
their status as permanent members of  the United Nations Security Council
A striking fact is that combining their weapon sales
constitutes over 75 of global arms exports
After this fact comes to light
how can one expect that
the United Nations would adopt a resolution
to curtail arms exports globally?
In May of this year Oxfam Internationals Head of New York office highlighted that
four out of the five permanent  members of the UN Security Council
are the worlds leading arms sellers
These weapons fuel conflicts worldwide
This is truly hypocritical complicit and immoral
Apart from them Germany Italy and South Korea
also feature among the top 10 arms exporters
The weapons industry isnt bothered by
whats right and whats wrong who is an ally and who is not
This is evident in several examples
While many consider Russia a close friend to India
it is also one of the top three arms exporters to Pakistan
Between 2017 and 2021
China was the 1 weapons supplier to Pakistan
followed by Sweden
and Russia
Look at this report from 2021
Russia pledged to provide more weapons to Pakistan
despite Indias discomfort
Turning to weapon imports
the top countries importing weapons are
on this list of Top 10 Largest Arms Importers
India is at number one
followed by countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar
However whats interesting here is that
in positions 5th 7th and 10th
reveal an intriguing dynamic with  China South Korea and America
This suggests a complex game
of buying and selling weapons on the global stage
Seemingly unaffected by a countrys foreign policy
In the realm of geopolitics
the US aligns with Israel
while Russia and China form a separate bloc
even in the current crisis these two sides are evident
Russian President Putins opinion  on the IsraelPalestine war is that
it should be seen as a failure of the US policy
Asserting that the US neglects the wellbeing of Palestinians
China too condemns Israels actions in Gaza
characterizing them as beyond selfdefense
This might create the impression of a divide  with the US Europe and Israel on one side
and China and Russia on the other
However when it comes to weapon exports
these seemingly opposing nations  find themselves on the same side
These countries collectively export the most weapons globally
By now you might be thinking that  these countries are truly terrible
That we should be protesting the countries exporting weapons worldwide
But if you are thinking so you are missing the point
A nation is formed by its citizens
Americans arent bad
Neither are Russians Israelis or Chinese citizens
The citizens arent actually consulted
The major players in this deadly weapons mafia
are not everyday Americans  Russians Israelis or Chinese citizens
Ordinary people in these nations dont reap the benefits of arms sales
instead private weapons manufacturers are the ones raking in profits
Almost all of the weapons sold globally by these countries
arent sold by the governments rather theyre sold by private capitalists
Look at this list
The top 100 weapons companies
Out of the top 100 companies
only a handful are governmentowned
such as Israel Aerospace Industries or
Aviation Industry Corporation of China
Disregarding these exceptions
the majority are private entities
Lockheed Martin an American company holds the top spot
followed by Northrop Grumman in third place
In fact 51 of the companies on the list are American
What does this mean?
The massive profits generated from the sale of weapons
flow into the coffers of these private companies
Ironically the money used to purchase these weapons often comes from
taxpayers as governments fund these acquisitions
Many nations procure weapons either from private companies in their country
or when dealing with other countries
they engage with private entities of that country
Hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayers money
are funnelled into these companies
These funds are then utilized to purchase weapons
which inevitably end up being used in  conflicts that affect ordinary people
A report by the Stockholm International  Peace Research Institute in April this year
revealed that Indias military spending
stands at 814 billion
ranking it fourth globally in 2022
At the forefront of military expenditures is America
with 877 billion
followed by China at 292 billion
and Russia at 864 billion
The top 10 list also features the UK and France
all five permanent members of  the United Nations Security Council
are on this list too
Why dont these 5 nations collectively decide
to cease the wasteful spending on weapons?
A united commitment to refrain from attacking one another
could be a transformative step to  halt the financial drain on military budgets
However the irony lies in the fact that
the primary casualties of the weapons industry
are often the American citizens
The frequency of mass shootings in America
is alarmingly higher than any other country
This year alone till midSeptember  over 500 mass shootings occurred
with a tragic impact on children
making School Shootings a  distressingly common phrase in America
In 20212022 more than 327 school  shootings took place in American schools
This is a direct result of the lax regulation  surrounding gun ownership in America
Unlike in other countries where disputes
are settled with fists and kicks
But in America people do not hesitate to fire guns
Only because of the fact that the American laws
favour gun ownership
If the sale of weapons were prohibited
no one would be allowed to sell weapons
then these gun shootings would stop eventually
But how would the weapon manufacturers benefit then?
This is why dozens of children lose  their lives in America every year
politicians are often seen shedding tears
but the gun trade isnt affected
Disturbingly between 2005 and 2020
gun sales in America tripled
In the previous year alone Americans  purchased a staggering 166 million guns
The government can easily  change this if it wanted to
Governments do not need to bow down to the weapons industry
Take Australia for example
once known for lax gun regulations
but in April 1996 when a 28yearold man  k!lled 35 people with a semiautomatic rifle
Gunman k!lls 25 people
in Australias worst massacre
The situation remains tense at the
Port Arthur side
Following this mass shooting
Australian Prime Minister John Howard took decisive action
to address the issue of firearms
The National Firearms Agreement  was implemented a month later
Between October 1996 and September 1997
the government seized over 650000 privately owned guns
The gun owners were given monetary compensation
to surrender their firearms to the government
People who had guns illegally werent compensated
but legal amnesty was provided to them
they didnt face prosecution for  voluntarily turning in their illegal weapons
As a result today in Australia
such mass shootings are rarely seen if ever
Something similar happened in Serbia earlier this year
Following two shootings in May
resulting in 17 d3aths including children
the government declared a onemonth amnesty period
for citizens to surrender their unregistered weapons
Recent mass shootings which left 17 people d3ad
and 21 wounded
have sparked public outrage
Authorities have also declared
a onemonth amnesty period
for citizens to handover unregistered weapons
or face prison sentences
Over 13500 weapons were  voluntarily surrendered within a week
Later this date was extended
and within 2 months more than 100000 illegal weapons
were handed over to the government
It shows that with political will governments can
effectively control the weapons and mitigate violence

In certain regions the influence of the weapons  mafia has expanded beyond arms sales
Private companies are not only profiting from selling weapons
but have ventured into providing private armies
commonly known as Mercenaries
During the RussiaUkraine war
the Wagner group gained attention
for attempting to overthrow Putin from the government
Considered by Putin as an antinational force
the group was subsequently disbanded
But do you know how did this group form?
The Wagner group originated in Russia
Putin had said that this group
received funding from the state budget
a fact that was initially denied for years
Putin eventually admitted to allocating  1 billion to the group in a year
Dmitry Kiselyov the head of the state controlled Russian media group
stated that the Wagner group was provided  a total of 98 billion by the Russian government
Remarkably taxpayer money was  used to finance private armies
The logical question arises
Why didnt Russia use its army?
Why opt to hire private mercenary groups?
The primary motivation behind this decision  is costeffectiveness
In a wartime scenario
providing funds to a private company
allows the companys private army to  fight the war on behalf of the country
Deploying the national army is very bothersome
In the form of various financial obligations  such as pension payments
army officers salaries health insurance
and compensations for families of martyrs
Choosing to hire contract fighters is better because
once the country makes a payment to the company
the company bears all other responsibilities
Even if a mercenary of the private army d!es fighting
they arent included in the official casualty counts
While headlines may report the number of  Russian or Ukrainian soldiers k!lled
a third category exists
private army soldiers fighting
who were neither Russian nor Ukrainian
but were fighting on behalf of Russia
Their d3aths may not garner  significant attention or discussion
You might be wondering who would want to fight  as a part of a private companys armies
Friends mercenaries often hail from  economically disadvantaged countries
driven by financial constraints and limited job opportunities
they often join the army of these private companies
These private armies are not only  contracted by governments
but also by private companies and warlords
The Wagner Group for instance  engaged in conflicts beyond Ukraine
including countries like Syria Sudan Mozambique
Mali Burkina Faso and Libya
In these impoverished nations they are  frequently employed in mining contracts
The private mining companies that make money  by selling the resources of these poor nations
hire these private armies so that
they could quell local protests
Companies by Yevgeny Prigozhin mined for gold
uranium and diamonds particularly in
countries such as Sudan Mali Libya  and the Central African Republic
These private armies k!lled hundreds of innocent civilians
looting houses harassing activists  and even k!lling journalists
The Wagner Group is not the only private military company
Russia has also employed other private military companies
Like POTOK Don Brigade Moran Security Group
and Slavonic Corps ENOT Corp to name a few
Russia isnt the only one to do so
For instance Yair Klein a former Lieutenant Colonel in the Israeli Army
established Spearhead Limited a mercenary group
that supplied weapons trained d3ath squads
in rightwing paramilitary groups in Colombia
Additionally organized militias for  drug traffickers like Pablo Escobar
Despite the Colombian government seeking to arrest him
Klein just like other wealthy individuals  managed to evade legal consequences
Israel is renowned for its cyber mercenaries
who engage in cybercrimes for money
including hacking forging blackmail material disinformation spreading
planting false intelligence and surveillance
Team George an Israeli cyber mercenary group
interfered in 33 presidential campaigns
successfully influencing 27
Facebook exposed and banned 7 cyber  mercenary companies in December 2021
These companies had targetted almost 50000 people worldwide
Four of these were Israeli cybermercenaries
like Black Cube and Cobwebs
Apart from this you would have heard of Pegasus
an infamous spyware sold to governments worldwide
this was being sold by an Israeli private company
An Israeli private cyber mercenary group  called the NSO Group
Talking about America
between 1994 and 2007
approximately 300 billion was spent on 12 private militias
One of these private military company is Blackwater
founded by former US Navy officer Eric Prince
Blackwater hires fighters from various countries
including the Philippines Bosnia Israel and Chile
selling its private services for money
In September 2007
Blackwater gained notoriety when its mercenaries
k!lled 17 innocent Iraqi civilians
Although four individuals were initially being prosecuted
they were pardoned in 2020  during Donald Trumps presidency
Blackwaters involvement has contributed to  the escalation of numerous wars worldwide
In December 2021 a United Nations report
accused Eric Prince of
violating the weapons ban in Libya
The ongoing conflict in Libya
is now characterized as a private war
Look at this news article stating that  Blackwater was hired by the Obama government
to provide security in Afghanistan in 2010
at a cost of 220 million
public tax money was handed over  to these private armies
Fast forward to 2021 when the Taliban  regained control of Afghanistan
reports from the Wall Street Journal revealed that
Eric Prince was charging 6500 per person
to facilitate safe evacuations from  Afghanistan on charter flights
During the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in America
Blackwater secured a 73 million contract
to assist the FEMA staff during the  Katrinaaftermath recovery operation
Not only this Eric Prince has also made  significant political donations to Republican politicians
This intertwining of financial contributions and business transactions
works quite well here
not only are the superrich businessmen corrupt
but theyre dealing in weapons transactions
k!lling people all over the world
Eric Prince handed donations to politicians
and the politicians handed his company Blackwater contracts worth 800 million
In Iraq over 160000 Blackwater employees
served as guards for US officials
An internal report from Blackwater disclosed that
among 195 shooting incidents in the last two years
the companys employees shot the first bullet in 160 instances
Its also quite common
for politicians to invest in stocks  of these private contractor companies
thereby becoming direct shareholders
This goes beyond a mere bribery situation
Any benefit made by the company would directly benefit the politician
George Bush was the US President during the Iraq invasion
his father was a Board member of the Carlyle Group
This same group was awarded numerous defense contracts
through companies like Vought and United Defense
Furthermore the then US Vice President Dick Cheney
used to be the head of the company Halliburton
which received a 7 billion defense contract  without any competitive bidding
The same company was awarded  contracts to restore the oil sector in Iraq
Now many people allege
that the real reason behind the Iraq war was
Iraqs oil
Oil companies like Halliburton  Exxon Mobil Chevron BP and Shell
established themselves in Iraq
As of December 2021
there are at least 15 influential politicians in America
actively shaping US defense policy
who have personal investments in these military contractors
They are directing US military policy
while profiting from these armsselling  companies by holding their stocks
Can there be a more drastic conflict of interest?
By now two key points should be clear
First in wars like the IsraelPalestine situation
the weapons industry reaps significant benefits
Second politicians benefit off of it too
since they are personally invested in it
especially those who have investments  in these weapon manufacturing companies
Adding to this the third point emerges
politicians often derive political benefits from wars
As poet Rahat Indori noted
Are tensions erupting on the borders? Find out if its time for elections
When politicians have to answer for  issues like corruption and unemployment
they can use wars to divert public attention
Especially for dictators
war serves as an effective distraction
George Orwells novel 1984 emphasizes the idea that
war should perpetually go on
not necessarily to win
but to continue fighting it
to maintain and consolidate power
Think about it for yourself
India refrains from attacking other nations
thats a matter of national pride
In India the military expenditures are  primarily directed towards selfdefense
especially against neighbouring countries like Pakistan and China
However when analyzing Chinas behavior
questions arise Why does China  keep on encroaching on our borders?
Does a farmer in Shanghai benefit from the Chinese intrusion?
Or some school teacher in Beijing?
This muscleflexing and chestthumping  mainly serves leaders like Xi Jinping
helping them consolidate and sustain power
In foreign policy such politicians are labelled hawkish
while those advocating for peace are termed doves
Hawkish politicians often use  public tax money to fortify their positions
In reality during wars
its the common people who end up fighting each other
not the politicians themselves
An example from 2014 highlights this
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus son
had started his mandatory threeyear army service
However this turned out to be fake news
misleading the public into thinking his son  was directly involved in the conflict
Critics have rightfully condemned
him for sending his son to  enjoy life at some American beach
while sending ordinary citizens to fight
These issues should prompt the media to  raise their voices and provide critical coverage
Unfortunately in many countries  the media is often so corrupt
that it looks to benefit from wars
eagerly chasing the prospect of increased  TRP by talking about the latest conflict
Especially those TV channels aligned with governments interest
they find it convenient
to neglect the daytoday issues faced by the common people
and focus solely on warrelated news
This highlights a stark truth about  the worlds weapons industry
an industry whose existence would be jeopardized
if global wars were to cease
Perhaps this is why it is beneficial
to continue wars to ensure the continuous flow of money

a conflict that occurred a century ago
where common people were sacrificed  to save the interests of kings
Click here to watch  the complete story of World War I
In 1875
a girl was born in the small town of Arles France
Jeanne Louise Calment
It was a time when cars and aeroplanes
were not yet invented
People used to travel by horsedrawn carriages
People used candles to light their homes
At this time no human being in the world
would have even dreamt
that this girl would make history
She will live such a long life
such a long life
that she will break all the world records
In 1889 Louise was only 14 years old
when the Eiffel Tower was built in Paris
In 1896
when Louise got married at the age of 21
Mahatma Gandhi had just moved to South Africa
By the way Mahatma Gandhi
was only 6 years older than Lewis
Fast forward to 1914
when Louise was only 39 years old
and was living a happily married life
and had a daughter
A huge explosion shook Europe
World War I began
In 1934
when Hitlers rise was being seen in Germany
there was an unfortunate tragedy in Louises family
Her daughter died of a lung infection
She was 59 years old then
59 is an age when
most women have become grandmothers
But Louise herself would have never imagined
that her life was not even half complete
In 1942 World War II was in full rage in Europe
Millions of people lost their lives in this war
Millions of people were separated from their families
And something similar happened at Louises home too
When she was 64 years old
she lost her husband
In 1947 Prime Minister Nehru hoisted the flag of independent India
India gained independence from the British
Louise was 72 years old at that time
And she was watching the pages of history turning unknowingly
In her life horses were replaced by cars
and candles by electricity
In 1969 when she celebrated her 94th birthday
humans stepped on the moon
One small step for man
A giant leap for mankind
In 1985
Rajiv Gandhi got a historic victory in the Indian elections
In India the IT revolution was just about to begin
At that time Louise was 110 years old
She was happily living in her house till now
but after this point
she moved to a nursing home
In 1988
the world finally started to pay attention to Louise
She was being discussed everywhere
she was in the news for being the oldest living human
In 1997 at the age of 122
when Louise passed away
the age of computers and the internet had already begun
crossed all the limits of imagination
She made a record that
no one has ever been able to break yet
What was the reason behind it?
What is the secret of living such a long life?
Lets find out in todays video
The first thing that comes to your mind is that
obviously luck was involved
if you want to live for 122 years
you will need a lot of luck
But the question here is that
in living such a long life
how much contribution is of luck
and how much of it is your lifestyle choices?
Between 1870 and 1900
scientific research was conducted in Denmark on twins
More than 2800 twins were analyzed
to study longevity and to see
how big is genetics as a factor
and how big are lifestyle and environment as factors
This research was known as the famous Danish twin study
And the conclusion of this was that
an average humans life
is 20 dictated by genes
and 80 is influenced by lifestyle and environment
That means your food choices
the way you exercise
and a healthy lifestyle
has a huge impact
on how long you will live
And a big impact of all these factors is on your hair
To some extent hair loss is natural
and it depends on genetics along with age
But to some extent it also depends on your lifestyle
Medically hair loss is categorised into 7 stages
If you are in between stages 1 to 4
then it can be controlled
after identifying the root cause
But if you are beyond stage 5
then it becomes more difficult to get your hair back
Then risky and expensive surgical procedures like hair transplants
remain the only options
So if you are in between stages 1 and 4
its not too late
and Traya can help you
Traya provides you with a holistic and safe solution for hair loss

The next question is
what are the healthy lifestyle choices
that can help you live a long life?
The best way to figure this out is perhaps to
do a reverse research
To see the lifestyle of those
who are already living for such a long time
In the early 2000s Dan Buettner
an explorer and author was working for National Geographic
He decided to study such places in the world
where people live the longest
In 2003 he collaborated with
anthropologists historians dietitians and geneticists
to complete this mission
They used population data
to locate such areas in the world
where the most number people of ages 100 and above are found
These people are called centenarians because
they have lived a century
Around this time some other people were also researching the same thing
Like this research paper
that was published in
the Journal of Experimental Gerontology
Here they identified that
in the Sardinia region of Italy
the highest concentration of male centenarians is found
Those who are 100 years or above
The Italian villages with the highest concentration of these people
were marked by blue circles on the map
These places were referred to as the Blue Zone
On the other hand Dan Buettner found another such place
The Japanese Okinawa Island
With the longest disabilityfree life  expectancy in the world found there
They set out on an expedition to these places
to find out why people lived for so long here
The team of scientists and demographers explores the world
and finds five such Blue Zones
The first was Sardinia in Italy
Second Okinawa in Japan
Third in the American state of California
Loma Lindas Seventhday Adventist community
It is a religious sect within Christianity
Fourth the island of Icaria in Greece
And fifth the region of the Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica
People living in these five blue zones
live a longer life than the rest of the world
Is there anything special about these places?
Maybe the clean water and clean air here
or is it the lifestyle choices of these people
that facilitates this
Dan and his team worked for years to find out the real reason
And finally when they publish their report
they say that the real reason was
the lifestyle habits of the residents
Specifically 9 lifestyle habits
were common across these regions
They refer to these 9 habits as Power 9
What are these habits?
Lets find out one by one
so that you can learn from them
implement them in your life
and live a long life
The first lifestyle habit is
to Move Naturally
Its not that the elderly people living in blue zones
go to the gym and lift heavy weights regularly
or run a marathon
In fact their environment encourages
small natural movements throughout the day
For example most of these people live in villages
where cars are not used much
In fact if they want to go to meet their friends
or go to work
they have to walk
Along with that these people grow their gardens near their homes
where they go and work by themselves
Contrast this with the modern world
where nowadays most people sit at home
get in the car and go to the office
where they sit and work
And if they want to go somewhere for entertainment
they get in the car
and go to the cinema hall to watch a movie while they sit and relax
Natural walking is so rare in our modern lifestyle
The American Cancer Society surveyed more than 125000 adults
and found that people who sit for more than 6 hours a day
have a 19 higher chance of dy!ng in the next 21 years
Cancer coronary heart disease
stroke diabetes kidney disease
liver disease Parkinsons disease
Alzheimers nervous disorders
a total of 14 causes of deth
become more likely to occur the more you remain seated
Many studies have shown a major correlation here
Look at the latest study which states that
by walking at least 11 minutes every day
the risk of premature deth
is reduced by 25
Just by walking for 11 minutes
But obviously in the case of blue zones
natural walking is much more common
The more you include natural walking in your daily life
the better it is
Now walking uses specific muscles of the legs
but it is very important to naturally move every muscle in the body
What we see in Okinawa is that
people dont have a lot of furniture in their homes
Instead of using dining tables
people sit on the floor to eat
What is the benefit of this?
They have to sit down and get up at least 34 times a day
More natural movement
The simple logic is to
try to incorporate natural movements in daily life as much as possible
You can buy a standing desk instead of a normal desk
You can sit on the floor and eat instead of at the dining table
In many places in India this has been the traditional way
And instead of using a car
use a cycle or walk as much as possible
The second point is purpose
Dans researchers found that in Okinawa
there is no concept like retirement
In fact there is a Japanese concept called Ikigai
It means a reason for being
What is the purpose of my life?
To have a sense of purpose
When people in Japan turn 90100 years old
they dont retire and give up on life
Instead they find the Ikigai of their life
A similar concept has been seen in Costa Ricas Blue Zone
called Plan de Vida
which translates to a Life Plan
Dans research found that having a sense of purpose in life
can increase life expectancy by up to 7 years
to have a life purpose doesnt necessarily mean
a purpose that will transform the world
The things that give you longterm satisfaction in daily life
that gives you internal happiness
those things can also be your purpose
For example volunteering for an NGO
becoming skilled in an art or craft
or picking up any hobby that you enjoy doing
Point number 3 Downshift
We all know that stress is not good for us
But do you know that chronic stress
a stress that you have to endure for a long period
can be very harmful to your health?
According to a study by Yale
if you are under a lot of chronic stress
your age faster
Many studies have repeatedly shown that
due to chronic stress
the risk of heart attack increases
the risk of diabetes increases
and the risk of cancer increases
Almost every agerelated disease is associated with stress
Look at this article
According to one study if you are stressed at work
your life can be shorter by 33 years
What is special about people living in blue zones?
Its not that they dont get stressed
The thing is that they have made such habits in their daily routines
that allows them to remain stressfree
Okinawans take some time every day to remember their ancestors
Adventists of California pray
Icarians of Greece take a nap in the afternoon
and Sardinians of Italy practice the happy hour
These are the things that help them reduce their stress levels
Okinawans have a special place in their home
which is called Butsudan
where they can honour their ancestors
And Adventists of California practice spiritual prayer
So one interesting thing to note here is that
praying to God is also
an effective way to reduce your stress
And taking naps in the afternoon
sleeping for 12 hours
research has proved that it improves your cardiovascular health
and helps you lower the levels of stress
On the other hand the way to reduce stress for Sardinians is
through social interaction
They have a happy hour from 5 PM to 7 PM
when they meet their friends and family
So the lesson here is that
you should also have a daily ritual in your life
to reduce your stress
Whether you do yoga meditation pray to God
go to church and pray offer Namaz
spend time with your family
nap in the afternoon or
participate in some sports or exercise
It is important not to get stressed
Fourth point 80 rule
In Japan there is a phrase called Harahachibu
Which means to eat until you are 8 parts full
While eating eat only so much
that your stomach is only 80 full
Dont eat so much that you are 100 full
In Okinawa this practice is followed
which reminds people to stop eating after they are 80 full
In the 4th century BC Ayurvedic medicine also described this principle
It says to fill up 13rd your stomach with the liquid
13rd with the food
and leave the remaining 13rd empty
Generally there are proven scientific benefits of eating less food
And the interesting thing is that
fasting has been a part of almost every religion or culture for centuries
Hindus fast during Navratri
Muslims fast during Ramadan
and some Christians fast before Easter
Scientists have found that fasting has many scientific benefits
Last year Yale School published a clinical trial
It found that those who cut their calorie intake by 14
saw many health improvements in their life
Their ageing pace slowed down
In 1935 a scientist Clive McCay
made a shocking discovery on rats
He gave rats little food
and found that the lifespan of rats
increased by 33 by doing this
Similar experiments have been done on many  different animals in the last few decades
Be it worms rats or monkeys
Specific details vary from study to study
but every study came to the same conclusion
By eating less food regularly
lifespan extends from 50 to 300
Point number 5 Plant Slant
The diet of most of the people in the blue zone
is a plantslant diet
This diet is mostly a plantbased vegetarian diet
In the blue zones either people dont eat meat at all
or if they do it is a small part of their meal
In the diets of all these centenarians
a large amount of beans is seen
Whether it is fava beans black beans
soybeans or literally lentils
In places like Okinawa people do eat pork
but on average they eat it only 5 times a month
But apart from this in all blue zones
whole grains are eaten a lot
Various types of vegetables are eaten a lot
And tubers are eaten a lot
Tubers are anything that grows under the ground
Like sweet potatoes or potatoes or nuts or beans
In California the blue zone community called Loma Linda
there people are fully vegetarian
and some of them are vegan
In 2023 an analysis was done analyzing multiple research studies
between 1980 and 2022
where vegetarian and vegan diets were observed
And the conclusion was that
eating a plantbased diet reduces the risk of several diseases
Diabetes Dementia High Blood Pressure Obesity
Colon Cancer Breast Cancer Prostate Cancer
And the metaanalysis by Dan on the PlantSlant Diet
found that in these 5 blue zones
the centenarians that were surveyed
95 of them ate plantbased diets
Point number 6
This is a largely controversial point
Dans research found that in most blue zones
except for the California blue zone
people consumed alcohol in moderate amounts
For example in Sardinia
people drink 12 glasses of red wine every day
If you look at old research papers
many such researches show that
drinking red wine in moderation can be good for health
The reason behind this is
the antioxidants present in red wine like Resveratrol
It increases the amount of good cholesterol in the body
But this is the only point
that has perhaps become outdated
Because the latest research and studies tell us that
even a small amount of alcohol can be harmful to you
That is drinking zero alcohol is the healthiest
This shows that the centenarians living in the blue zones
are living a long life
not because of drinking wine
but despite drinking wine
The beneficial antioxidant in red wine resveratrol
is also found in grape juice actually
And even better than grape juice
it is found in grapes
So if you want to benefit from this
simply eat grapes
Point number 7 is Belong
which can be called the sense of belonging
263 centenarians were interviewed
and every one of them except 5
was part of some faithbased community
It doesnt matter which religion you believe in
or whether you believe in religion or not
You must become a part of a social or spiritual community
This community can be your religious community as well
Any community that gives you a purpose
peace and a positive outlook in life
Another way to get this is
to do community service
volunteer help people or do charity
You can get this sense of belonging even then
Dans research found that this is so important that
for people who attend faithbased services 4 times a month
their life expectancy increases from 414 years
Imagine you will live for 14 more years by doing this
Point number 8 Loved Ones First
Centenarians from the blue zone prioritize their family
Either they live in the area around their ageing parents and grandparents
or they live with them in the same home
Apart from this they remain committed to their one life partner
with whose help according to Dans research
life expectancy can increase by 3 years
And then they invest their time and affection in their children
Finally we come to the last 9th point
which is Right Tribe
Okinawans have a friend circle of about 5 friends
and they are committed to their 5 friends for the rest of their lives
People living in blue zones are part of such social circles
that support these healthy behaviours
Many research papers show that
things like smoking obesity
happiness and loneliness are contagious
If your friend circle is made up of such people
who promote good habits
and not bad habits
then it can be very beneficial for you
Following healthy behaviours becomes very easy
when people around you are following the same healthy behaviours
After listening to all this you must be thinking
Is it possible to live a long life outside these 5 blue zones?
Dan wondered the same thing as well
In his opinion
a 6th blue zone can be added to this group soon
A blue zone where traditionally people didnt have a healthy lifestyle
but in the future due to their changing behaviour
they can definitely become a new blue zone
Dan says that he has witnessed
life expectancy in Singapore increasing by almost 25 years
Today people living in Singapore
have one of the longest and healthiest life expectancies
The reason behind this is the policies made by the government
which subsidize healthy food
and impose heavy taxes on junk food
Government policies promote walking
The infrastructure is designed to make  people walk more in their daily lives
And there is a heavy tax on driving to discourage it
Another interesting thing in Singapore is that
if your elderly parents live within a radius of 500 yards of your house
you get a tax break
So the result is in front of you friends
Now you know exactly what you have to do to live a long life
You may not be able to break the record of being the worlds oldest human
You may need a lot of luck to live for 120 years
But if you follow the things I have told you in this video
you will easily live for a century
If you liked the video you can watch this video
on the worlds fattest country
In this video I told you about extremely positive examples
In that video I will tell you about an extremely negative example
of what you should not do
On 8th August 1942
in the Gwalior Tank Maidan Mumbai
the leaders of the All India Congress Committee gathered
They were about to announce a movement
A final struggle against the British  imperialist government in power
In front of thousands of people
Mahatma Gandhi gave a historic speech
Every one of you should consider yourself free
We can no longer live under the shoes of imperialism
We need complete freedom
I give you a mantra
You may imprint it on your hearts
and let every breath of yours give expression to it
This mantra is Do or Die
Do or Die
Either we will see India free
or we will be k!ll3d in this attempt
But we shall not live in this slavery anymore
Long live Mother India!
Well succeed or d!e trying!
Friends this was the beginning of
the Quit India Movement
Quit India Movement
The British government was aware of it
Since a few months prior to this the  Home Department of the British government
was working on a 3stage plan to end this movement
Stage 1 Use of Propaganda
Controlling the media in such a way that
no newspaper could publish this news
Stage 2 Raiding the offices of Congress organizations
seizing their funds
and arresting all the leaders of Congress
Stage 3 was to suppress the mass movement
using emergency powers
declaring the Congress leaders as antinational
and thus ending the movement  before it even began
The next day 9th August
Mahatma Gandhi Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Maulana Azad
and all the top leaders of Congress
were arrested and put in jail
These leaders were not to be  released from jail for many years
Then the question was  how to further this movement?
In todays video you will hear  a great story of inspiration
Amidst so much oppression and difficulties
How does the slogan of revolution
reach every corner of the country?
And who were those traitors living in the country
who were on the side of the British  during this movement?
Lets understand the Quit India Movement in depth
It was exactly 2 years before this movement started
8th August 1940
British Raj had presented an offer to Indian  freedom fighters through Viceroy Linlithgow
It was called the August Offer
In this he said that the Indian  representation would be increased
in the BritishIndian government
Actually this was the time
when World War II was in full rage in Europe
Germanys dictator Adolf Hitler
was successfully invading one country after another
and Britain was the only country standing against him
The British government in the UK
was in big trouble and was desperate
to get help from wherever it could
Although Indian soldiers were already  fighting on behalf of the British in World War II
the British wanted more cooperation from the Indians
So they decided to send in an offer to convince the Indians
Till this time Congress had decided that
they would not accept inconsequential offers
They wanted complete freedom
They said that if the British government wanted
India to cooperate with them in WWII
then they would have to give  complete independence to India
So this August Offer was a failure
After this in March 1942
another delegation was sent by Britain
It was called the Cripps Mission because
the leader of the House of Commons  at that time was Stafford Cripps
The missions aim was
to give India independence  after the end of World War II
but the offer given by the British in the Cripps Mission
was not of full freedom
but of Dominion status
As per the Cripps Offer  India would be an autonomous region
under the British Commonwealth
This was a better offer than the previous one
but Congress outrightly rejected it
They clearly stated their goal
complete freedom
By then Congress leaders were  fed up with these offers and negotiations
A few months later on 14th July 1942
in the Wardha Committee
a resolution was passed to  start a civil disobedience movement
Many prominent leaders of the time like
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rajendra Prasad
and Jayaprakash Narayan showed great interest
in this initiative
9 days after the meeting on 23rd July
Secretary of State for India Lord Amery
wrote a letter to the Secretary of State  for the Colonies Viscount Cranborne
He stated that the resolution  passed at the Wardha meeting
would be approved on 7th August in the  All India Congress Committee meeting
After this a mass movement would begin
which would be a direct challenge to the British Empire
He stated that they should  take strict measures to prevent it
He wrote in the letter
If necessary we have to contemplate
therefore the probable arrest of Gandhi
and of the members of the Working Committee
It is also mentioned that
some of the Congress leaders  should be deported to Africa
so that this movement could not begin
The next day the British Rajs Home Department
shared a threestage plan with Amery
to stifle this movement
The same plan that I mentioned at the beginning of the video
This is the reason why when the  All India Committee passed the Quit India Resolution
the British already knew about it
After Mahatma Gandhis historic speech
on 9th August at around 5 in the morning
Gandhi and the other top leaders were arrested
After the arrest Mahatma Gandhi  was taken to the Aga Khan Palace in Pune
The British had a strategic reason for this
Viceroy Linlithgow wrote to Amery saying that
they should send the Mahatma to a place
that doesnt have the word Jail in its name
If the people were to find out that he was put into a jail
it might infuriate the masses
So they decided to pretend that Gandhi  was placed under housearrest in a Palace
We may be quite certain
that we shall have some  uphill propaganda battles to fight
After these arrests the Congress party was banned
All the offices of Congress across the country
were sealed and declared antinational
Two other influential organizations of that time
the Muslim League and Hindu Mahasabha
didnt face any restrictions
Because both these organizations
were not supporting the Quit India Movement
I will discuss this in detail later in the video
but before that lets see the medias reaction
Not a single word of Gandhis historic speech  was allowed to be printed in the newspapers
So neither did any newspaper publish  Mahatma Gandhis speech
nor did they talk about the British governments action
How could one convey Gandhis message to the people?
Friends at this point in our story enters
22yearold activist Usha Mehta
Along with some of her colleagues
she found a transmitter and  started an underground radio station
Congress Radio 4234 thus began
It was on 14th August when this  underground radio station began transmitting
And the words you just heard  were spoken by none other than Usha Mehta
Through this radio the messages of  the All India Congress Committee
were broadcast to every corner of the country
Such underground media channels started  opposing the propaganda of the British Raj
To keep their location hidden
in her messages Usha Mehta used to say
This is Congress Radio  from somewhere in India
But actually she was operating from Bombay
It took the British government about 3 months  to find the source of this radio
But by then a lot of people were already aware
Gradually All India Radio was called AntiIndia Radio
when they tried to jam the Congress radio
Finally on 12th November 1942
the British government arrested Usha Mehta
All her equipment was seized
and despite interrogating her for 6 months
she does not reveal anything to the British
Later in 1969
when she was interviewed she said
When the press is gagged and all news banned
a transmitter certainly helps a good deal
in furnishing the public withspreading the message of rebellion in the remotest corners of the country
When this movement began Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose
was living in Berlin Germany
And he was trying his best
to raise awareness through his Azad Hind Radio
As soon as the news of the  Quit India Movement reached Netaji
he told his friend ACN Nambiar
it was time to support Gandhi
Although there was a lot of difference in  the methods of Netaji and Gandhi ji
Netaji was completely in favour  of the Quit India Movement
He called this movement  Indias NonViolent Guerrilla Warfare
On one hand our freedom fighters were  trying to raise awareness among the masses
on the other hand some new faces emerged
who were ready to protest on the ground
A few words from Mahatma Gandhi  inspired people to such an extent that
its beyond our imagination
Matangiri Hazra was a 72yearold woman who lived in the Bengal Presidency
She is known as Gandhi Buri in Bengali
which means old femaleGandhi
On 29 September 1942
she led a rally of 6000 people in her district
Her plan was to hoist the flag at  the Tamluk police station nearby
and to capture the police station
She was more courageous than her age
Despite the police threats she did not stop
Vande Mataram!
She was leading this rally from the front
chanting Vande Mataram
when she was shot thrice
Even after she was shot
she didnt stop chanting Vande Mataram
Eventually she fell down holding the Tiranga in her hand
After 30 years of independence in 1977
Hazra became the first woman revolutionary
whose statue was erected in Kolkata Maidan
Thousands of people like Hazra
were open fired at by the British in an effort to suppress this movement
Ram Manohar Lohia wrote a letter  to the then Vice Royal Linlithgow
in which he stated that
more than 50000 revolutionaries were k!ll3d
during this Quit India Movement
Apart from this more than 100000 arrests were made
These include many names  that might not have never heard of
Like Sucheta Kripalani
who later became the 4th Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
She led her own underground movement
Some leaders were ready to be arrested
and they had already made alternate plans
For example when Yusuf Meher Ali  was arrested on 9th August
he had already told his friends
that it was their responsibility to  continue the movement further
One of them was Aruna Asaf Ali
who led the first demonstration of  the Quit India Movement on 9th August
in Gwalior Tank Maidan
She was later called the Grand Old Lady  of the Independence Movement
She was the first mayor of Delhi
and in 1997 she was awarded Bharat Ratna
During the movement Aruna Asaf Ali  was saved from being arrest
by being underground
On the other hand there were some leaders
who were jailed but when they came out they continued their work
Like Jai Prakash Narayan
who was put in Hazaribagh Central Jail
and together with his friends he made a plan to escape from the jail
On the night of Diwali 8th November 1942
when most of the guards were not on duty
they successfully carried out a historic jail break
He escaped from the jail with 7 other prisoners
and fled to Nepal where
he started the Azad Dastan
There are many more such stories from all over the country
where during the Quit India Movement not only the leaders
but even the common people were  doing their best to take part in the protest
From collecting school fees by the students
to blocking the railway tracks by the villagers
no stones were left unturned
The British governments police station courts
post offices and other symbols of the government authorities
were attacked
In colleges the students went on strike
and marches were organised
In Bombay Jamshedpur and Ahmedabad
factory workers did not go to work for weeks
This is also something to note
Not everyone needs to take out rallies  to participate in the movement
Stopping your work going on organized strikes
is also a way to participate in the movement
In some places there was violence too
Bridges were blown up  telegraph wires were cut
and railway lines were blocked
In places like UP and Bihar at that time
there were slogans to set police stations on fire
On 31st August Viceroy Linlithgaon wrote  a letter to Winston Churchill stating that
I am engaged here in the meeting by far
the most serious rebellion since that of 1857
He acknowledged that the revolution he was dealing with
was so big that
the last comparable revolution was in 1857
All the strategies of the British government failed here
Despite arresting all the top leaders
this movement was moving ahead rapidly because
the common people were participating in this
How many people could you shoot?
How many could you put in jail?
By then violence was already on the rise
It is also very interesting to note what
Mahatma Gandhi thought about this violence
We know that in 1922
when violence was seen in the noncooperation movement
he stopped that movement
Once again in 1934 during the Civil Disobedience Movement
when violence began
Gandhi ji stopped that movement
But now during the Quit India Movement
when violent incidents were again seen
Gandhi ji was already tired
On 7th June 1942 he wrote in his weekly magazine Harijan
I waited and waited
until the countrydeveloped nonviolent strength
necessary to throw off the foreign yoke
I feel that I cannot afford to wait
If inspite of all precautions
rioting takes place
it cannot be helped
Gandhi jis approach this time was pragmatic
considering this complex situation
He blamed all this violence on the British government
Here if you want to understand  Mahatma Gandhis ideology in depth
then I would like to recommend his autobiography

In this entire struggle many people  didnt participate in this movement
Which is understandable
Not everyone dares to raise their  voice against the people in power
But there were some people who
were bootlicking the British so much that
they were supporting the British  in ending the Quit India Movement
There were two major organizations at that time
Muslim League and Hindu Mahasabha
The Muslim League passed a resolution in 1940
which is known as the Lahore Resolution
Because of this they demanded
that a separate country be created for Muslims
It is also called the Pakistan Resolution
At that time there was a Muslim League leader Fazlul Huq
he was the first Prime Minister of Bengal Province
Their government in Bengal was formed  with an alliance with the Hindu Mahasabha
In this Muslim League government
Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the Finance Minister
It was on 26 July 1942
about two weeks before the start of the Quit India Movement
Syama Prasad Mukherjee wrote a letter to the British government
Anybody who during the war
plans to stir up mass feelings
resulting in internal disturbances or insecurity
must be resisted by the government
Further he asked about how the Quit India  Movement could be combated in Bengal
He states that the administration should be such that
all efforts by the Congress would fail
And the movement would not begin in the Bengal Province
He was literally discussing ideas with the British government
on how to suppress this movement
During the 24th session of the Hindu Mahasabha in Kanpur
their party leader Vinayak Damodar Savarkar
came up with another strategy
The Hindu Mahasabha follows  the strategy of responsive cooperation
Not only did they intend to give  unconditional cooperation to the British government
they were also ready for active and armed resistance
At that time the Hindu Mahasabha was a political party
and at the organizational level
RSS had the same response towards the Quit India Movement
Thats why the British intelligence agencies
described their stance as follows
The Sangh has scrupulously kept itself within the law
andrefrained from taking part in the  disturbances that broke out in August 1942
While on one hand Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose formed the Azad Hind Fauj
a few months after the Quit India Movement
On the other hand Savarkar was helping the colonial government
recruit hundreds of thousands of Indians
in the British Armed Forces
These Indians joined the British Army
and fought against Subhash Chandra Boses Azad Hind Fauj
At that time there was a man named Narayan Apte
who joined the British Army
and later on became a recruiter for  the British Royal Indian Air Force
Later on he was found guilty
for being involved in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi
Along with that Nathuram Godses  brother Gopal Godse
was also fighting this war on the British side
Savarkar had said some more things  about the Quit India Movement
That this type of unscrupulous rebellion
did not deserve any sympathy
This was a huge insult to the freedom fighters
who were actually fighting  against the British at that time
And that is why after hearing this Netaji  Subhash Chandra Bose could not remain silent
On 14th August 1942
in Berlin he sent a message through the radio
I would request Mr Jinnah Mr Savarkar and all those leaders
who still think of a compromise with the British
to realise that in the world of tomorrow  there will be no British Empire
A senior leader of Hindu Mahasabha NC Chatterjee wrote
It is rather amusing to find
that Mr Jinnah wants
the Muslims to not join the Congress movement
and Mr Savarkar wants
Hindus not to join the same
Despite all this opposition friends
the Quit India Movement was successful
The world started talking about Indias freedom
The then American President Roosevelt  also put pressure on the UK government
to fulfil some of Indias demands
Even in Britain the British people were  demanding that India be given freedom
In June 1945 the British Labour Party  released its new manifesto
Let Us Face The Future
They made a promise to the British people
that if they came into power
then they would give complete freedom to colonies like India
Next month in 1945 the Labour Party came to power in Britain
and the new Prime Minister was Clement Attlee
And he openly declared that
it was time to give India selfgovernance
As soon as the government changed in Britain
the arrested Congress leaders  were released from jail in India
And two years after that the struggle that  our Indian freedom fighters started years ago
became successful
India got complete freedom
Although it was clear by 1945 that
Indias freedom was inevitable
in 1946 two other important things happened
which increased the importance of freedom
First the INA soldiers courtmartial
also known as the INA trials
and second the Royal Indian Navy Mutiny
Lets talk about these in detail in another video
For now if you liked this video
you can go and watch this video
in which I have explained in detail
why Indias partition happened
Who were the people and what were the incidents
that led to the partition?
Did you hear the news?
Im going to make a wildcard entry in Bigg Boss!
So many media houses have published this news
India TV India Times
ABP News India Today
Zoom TV Pinkvilla Economic Times
I mean look at this headline
Popular YouTuber Dhruv Rathee
set to make a wildcard entry
in Bigg Boss OTT 2
One website has confirmed this
Dhruv Rathee Bigg Boss OTT Entry Confirmed!
So is this true?
Till now no one has asked me to go on Bigg Boss this season
and neither have I told anyone that I want to go on Bigg Boss
So first of all
this tells you the standard of our Indian media
They will publish anything without any hesitation
Scroll down and see the article in Economic Times
there is a disclaimer

Please take all steps necessary

They do not take responsibility for the materials they post
They shift the responsibility on you to ascertain whether the news is true or not
And the second thing here is that
some of you would be wondering
if I am invited to Big Boss
will I go on Big Boss?
Let me say this clearly
even if they offer to pay me to be on the show
hundreds of thousands millions any amount of money
I will never go to such a nonsense show in my life
In my opinion this is a very cheap way to earn money and fame
which has a bad impact on society
So in todays video I would like to explain
what is problematic in the concept of this show?
Is this show scripted?
And why you should not watch such shows at all
If you or any of your family members
waste their time watching Bigg Boss
then this video is for you
Now theres news of
famous YouTuber Dhruv Rathees
possible wildcard entry in Big Boss
Once this guy Siddharth Yadav
made a YouTube video in which
he said that there are so many jobless people in our country
who watch Salman Khans movies
that have neither heads nor tails
This gives you an idea
of how many jobless people we have in our country
who enjoy watching such movies
that make no sense
But because it is Salman Khans movie
even if the ticket costs thousand rupees
they need to watch Salman Khans movies
regardless of anything
He was somewhat right
We shouldnt consume any content
that doesnt have any intellectual or profound content
that arent productive
Its a different matter that
he is in Bigg Boss house now
But its also true that
Bigg Boss is the most apt place for this type of person
People like him deserve to go on Bigg Boss
and in fact to win it
Im sure he can win this show
Because there are some specific qualities
that are required for this shows concept
Based on which this show can run
Ill tell you about that later in the video
but first
lets know the history of this show
How did this show begin?
In 1949 writer George Orwell
published a legendary novel
called 1984
This book talks about a dictatordystopian government
which is headed by
an unknown Big Brother
Posters are put up everywhere
Big Brother is watching you
The dictatorial government
is always watching you
In 1999
some guys in the Netherlands
took a similar concept from this novel
and turned it into a TV show
which they named Big Brother
The concept of this show was that
some people would live in a house
under constant surveillance
and under the command of Big Brother
To shape the format of this TV show
they took inspiration from some older TV shows also
Such as the MTV reality show
The Real World
and a 1997 Swedish TV show
Expedition Robinson
After a while this show became very popular
and started spreading all over the world
Copying this concept
America Canada Mexico
Brazil Argentina Australia
Indonesia Thailand the Philippines
China and Russia
made their Big Brothers
And when it comes to copying
the Indian entertainment industry cant lag behind
Big Brother was made into Big Boss in India
It was soon launched in different languages
After Hindi came Marathi Tamil Bengali
Telugu Kannada Malayalam
Then when OTT platforms came
they made Big Boss OTT
Big Boss
George Orwell mentioned Big Brother as a warning in his book
He was criticizing governments like Stalin and Hitler
and the techniques used in these dictatorships
to fool people
How propaganda for fascism is run on the telescreen
And there is constant surveillance
no one is safe from it
History is rewritten
The people display the bandwagon effect
Facts are presented in a completely distorted manner
And a cult personality is created around the Supreme Leader
The political opponents who question this dictatorial government
have to deal with conspiracy theories against them
They are declared antinational
Many famous slogans were given by this book
like Ignorance is power
Freedom is slavery
War is peace
Even today this novel is very relevant
especially when the governments buy software like Pegasus
using tax money
to surveil people to snoop
So this novel is a mustread
I would definitely recommend you read it
If you dont have time to read the novel
you can go to ChatGPT
and ask ChatGPT for a summary
Ill simply need to write
Explain the novel 1984 by George Orwell
in ten bullet points
using simple language
And here you can see
I have got a very good summary
of the story in this novel
It is about a man named Winston Smith
If you want to expand on any point
Elaborate on point 4
how were historical record changed?
Ask how history was rewritten in the novel
It is written here that if a wrong prediction is made by the party
people like Winstons were tasked with
changing the old news records
so that it looks like the party had made the right prediction
With the help of AI tools like ChatGPT
it has become so easy to understand complex ideas

so that you can master ChatGPT

Coming back to the topic
what are shows like Big Brother and Big Boss doing?
Contrary to this novel
they are providing you the cheapest form of entertainment
which has a heavy dose of two things
Everyday sadism and voyeurism
First lets look at sadism
The definition of this word is something like this
The tendency to derive pleasure
from inflicting pain suffering or humiliation on others
Enjoying hurting others and insulting them
You may find this shocking
but if you are a part of the audience watching Big Boss
then you are taking part in this sadistic pleasure too
Normally a sadistic personality is associated
with murderers or psychopaths
Only psychopath people
who kill others or hurt others
and enjoy it as they derive pleasure in doing so
But some psychological studies
have discovered a less extreme category of sadism
which is called Everyday Sadism
Like this study from 2013
which was published in the reputed journal
Psychological Science
They conducted psychological experiments on Everyday Sadism
Let me give you some examples
Youd remember that in the ancient Roman Empire
as you must have read in your text books
that the Colosseum in Rome
was a stadium for public entertainment
Here gladiators would often fight each other
Many times when a gladiator would get badly injured
the audience in the stadium would be asked
whether to let him go or to kill him
Many times the people would give a thumbs up
to kill him
Often in this arena
a hungry animal would be sent
like a tiger or a lion
to fight this gladiator
This is a good example of Everyday Sadism
because the people sitting in the stadium
were looking for entertainment in the suffering of a gladiator
Moving forward thousands of years
today many people enjoy watching street fights
When two people start fighting on the road
whatever the reason
often a crowd gathers
Very few people try to stop the fight
Most people just stand around
and enjoy the fight
Another example of this are the bullies
People who like to bully others
in school or college
People who enjoy humiliating others
Or you would have seen people who
will start kicking or throwing stones at dogs  on the side of the road for no reason
Just because they enjoy it
A moderate example of this in an office could be
a boss who is always criticising an employee for no reason
Not because he wants to get some work done
Just because he enjoys
inflicting mental pain on his employees
These are the major examples of Everyday Sadism
Mob lynching is another example
This year in May
a Bihar migrant worker
was lynched in Kerala by a crowd
when accusations were raised that he was a thief
Something similar happened in the Palghar incident
when two sadhus were lynched
because of a rumour that they were child kidnappers
Its a different matter that later
some biased media anchors
put a HinduMuslim touch to this
to give it a communal angle
You will see many examples of Everyday Sadism everywhere
If someone on the street says that
they have caught a pickpocketer
4 people would gather and start beating him
They justify their actions by saying that
they beat him because he was a pickpockter
But in reality the reason for such things is
to derive sadistic pleasure
by beating someone
You can see this Everyday Sadism in political binaries as well
Like when journalist Vinod Dua passed away
There was a group of people who were celebrating this
On the other hand when news anchor Rohit Sardana passed away
There were some people on the other side who were celebrating this
Now criticizing the work of these people is one thing
but taking a sadistic pleasure in their passing away
finding ones happiness in anothers death
is a good example of sadism
People often have many justifications
in the name of Everyday Sadism
Some say that this is the justice of nature
and some say that this is karma
But actually all of this is sadism
People derive sadistic pleasure
when they see someone getting insulted or trolled
Entire YouTube channels are often made on this
Where in each and every video someone gets insulted
someone gets abused or someone gets bullied
Now I am not criticizing the roast format here
because making roast videos can be an art
It can be done positively
without sadism
A good example of this would be
Slaypoints YouTube channel
which makes roast videos
They criticize stupid things
like being an irrational motivational guru
or some absurd food recipes
But they poke fun on the stupidity
They do not intend to abuse bully or insult someone
A 2018 study by the University of Innsbruck showed
how everyday sadists
like to play especially violent video games
Because thats what uplifts their mood
Thats what gives them happiness
Often films are made to exploit this sadism
They are called Torture Films
Like the Saw series
or Human Centipede
Some people liked Jokers character in the film Dark Knight
because perhaps their own sadistic personality
gets validated by that
But on the other hand there are some films
that I would like to state as examples
which sensitively depict sadism
For example the film The Platform
or Snowpiercer
Criticizing the socioeconomic system
showing violence without glorifying it
And finally if we come to Bigg Boss
TV shows like Big Brother and Bigg Boss
exploit this Everyday Sadism
They try to appease this
Their formula is that people like to watch this nonsense
so they give them nonsense
And to be honest this Everyday Sadism in Bigg Boss
reaches the next level
Contestants always fight with each other
There are often physical fights
People throw utensils at each other
In one case a contestant threw boiling water at another
Theres physical violence
In one case a contestant chokeslammed another contestant
The contestants arent the only ones to do this
rather the concept of the show encourages this
For example once the contestants were given a torture task
in which they had to throw chilli powder on the faces of other contestants
The contestants are made to do such nonsensical tasks
so that they can be humiliated
People are asked to bathe in cow dung
A man was asked to drink water from a dog bowl
Often people leak each others personal matters
which makes people cry
You get to see body shaming
A female contestant tells another female contestant
that some people were not worthy of standing with her
Criticising their physical appearance
Backbiting is a crucial component of this show
You regularly see misogyny and homophobia
Sometimes someone mixes soap in someones water
Sometimes a guy breaks the lock of the washroom
when a girl is taking a shower
Often you see toxic relationships
Some of these are fake relationships
which are shown just to increase the shows TRP
Then comes the concept of Voyeurism
This word means
taking cheap pleasure in watching other peoples lives
Enjoying closely watching what happens in other peoples private lives
Once again you will see many examples of this in your daily life
Like if there is an MMS leak
You see people searching on Google to find it
Another example of this could be
some people like to watch daily vlogs
There are some YouTubers whose vlogs are aimed at
when they woke up brushed their teeth
played with their dog rode their bicycle
and then they went shopping
Why do people find these things entertaining?
Because of voyeurism
People enjoy watching whats going on in their personal lives
And its a shame that some YouTubers even exploit this
Like their child may be crying
but they think about getting the camera  because it will be good content
Their child might be hurt
but first they take the camera and film it
If there is a fight at home
they want to be the ones to stream it
So that they get some content
Many people often make a dangerous onesided parasocial relationship
with daily vloggers
In my opinion children should not be allowed
to watch daily vlogs
Since childrens brains are not fully developed
so voyeurism can be very dangerous for them
Another moderate example of this is CCTV footages
People enjoy watching
CCTV footage of thieves being captured
or someone being murdered  or a terrorist attack or road accidents
Media houses also often play these footages on TV
So Everyday Voyeurism
obviously increases in a surveillance state
So if we talk about Bigg Boss again
then this Everyday Voyeurism is exploited badly by Bigg Boss
In Bigg Boss 16 98 cameras were installed inside the house
And now a different level of madness is taking place regarding voyeurism
Contestants are often recorded 24x7 with multicameras
and the audience is also allowed to watch them 24x7 on a live feed
They can choose any of the three cameras
and choose what they want to watch
And as you know there is so much  unemployment in the country that
there are a lot of people who are free
who have no other work
so they start watching this
By watching the live feed of these cameras
one can take some voyeuristic pleasure
People often share their personal secrets  with their close friends and best friends
But here people are told
to tell their personal secrets on national television
To generate content and TRP
And the amazing thing is that
nothing about this reality TV show is real
Contestants know that they are being recorded for 24 hours
with so many cameras
So will any contestant
behave in their natural state here?
Will your behaviour be the same
as it is normally?
Everyone will be selfconscious to some extent
Secondly an artificial competitive setup is created in this show
so that you will naturally have to insult others
and backbite others
if you want to rise above them
In Bigg Boss house this is called performance
These interactions between people
are these natural interactions
that would happen in real life?
In real life
if so many people have to live in a house
there will hardly be a fight between them
Here such setups are forced
to create arguments and fights between people
The truth is friends
the world is not that stupid
Although I have told you many examples of  Everyday Sadism and Everyday Voyeurism
But most people are not like that
There are many intellectual wellbehaved
dignified and compassionate people in the world
Take Dr Vikas Divyakirti for example
He has made many educational videos on philosophical topics
Or if we talk about actors and actresses
take Konkana Sen for example
She has given so many great performances in so many films
But in the 17 seasons of Bigg Boss
you would not have seen a single person like Dr Vikas Divyakirti or Konkana Sen
Firstly nice people will never go to such cheap shows
But secondly
even if a nice person goes to such shows
they are provoked
to be part of this sadism and voyeurism
To create controversy and insult people
and if they dont they will be thrown out
There was a participant in Bigg Boss 8
Sushant Divgikar
A model singer dancer psychologist
and winner of Mr Gay India 2014
He was thrown out of Bigg Boss very quickly
Later he said in an interview that
he has more than 500 books at home
he reads a lot and has an IQ of 147
But he said that he was sad to say that the collective IQ of the Bigg Boss 8 contestants
was less than room temperature
All the while Sushant lived in that house
Sushant didnt fight with anyone
he just kept busy with his songs and dance routines
But you dont get TRP like this
You get TRP only when
theres conflict or fights among contestants
Bhojpuri star Khesari Lal Yadav
was a contestant in Bigg Boss 13
He was also thrown out of the house very quickly
And when he gave an interview to Times of India
he said that the format of the show
doesnt suit him
Humans become devils in this house
And if you want to move ahead in this show
you can do so only by insulting and humiliating others
This was what he said
I was amid devils there
There in the form of humans
everyone was behaving like devils
And no one is human in there
What can anyone do?
Bigg Boss Season 4 contestant Rahul Bhatt said in an interview
I cant provide entertainment
to viewers at the cost of making a fool of myself
Why would the channel want to keep someone on the show
if there is no controversy or romance involving them?
So on the face of it it looks like
there is no public voting here
Only the TRP decides who will be thrown out of the house
Bigg Boss Season 9 contestant Aman Verma also said that
he had a preplanned deal with the producers
that he will be in the house for only 6 weeks
A Sunday special episode of Bigg Boss 16 was hosted by Shekhar Suman
He had criticized some of the contestants
but the viewers criticized him
for pointing out only some of the contestants
So he replied by saying that
he had been given a script
written by the channel
that he had to follow
Bigg Boss 4 winner Shweta Tiwari
Bigg Boss 6 contestant Aashka Goradia
and Bigg Boss 11 runnerup Hina Khan said
that this show is heavily edited
The long conversations
are shown as two lines only
It is deliberately shown
as if there are misunderstandings between the shows contestants
sheer misrepresentations
Aashka said that she was rubbing a balm  on another female contestants hand
after she had an allergic reaction
But the shows editors
used editing tricks
and showed only half of the things
and made it look like
she was a lesbian
Bigg Boss 7s contestant Shilpa Saklani says that
the show is not scripted
but that everyone knows what to do to win
There are prerequisites
to react and give content
to fight with each other
to put across their point of view
and to be assertive
So even if we ignore these accusations
of the show being scripted
even if we believe that the show is not scripted
some things are very clear in front of us
First there are no auditions here
Contestants are chosen by the makers of the show
Based on what?
Well it seems like based on intrigue
Second 24hour footage is edited to be a 50minute episode
Which of those 50 minutes are shown?
Those that will attract the most viewers
Third the viewers perception based on that edit
influences the voting
Often the rules are also bent
Sometimes there are no eliminations on some weekends
Sometimes the contestants who have been eliminated
are called back into the house
and sometimes there is a wildcard entrant
Everything is decided by the makers of the show
based on its saleability
Fourth the tasks given in the show
are also decided by the makers of the show
based on saleability
And what is saleable here?
No intellectual discussion
No social issues philosophy history
sociology spirituality
poetry literature cinema or science
None of it is being discussed here
People just want to watch others fighting
People want to see their personal lives
People want to see people backbiting others
People want to see other people insulting each other
A cocktail of Everyday Sadism and Voyeurism
Whose show is it?  The show makers
Whos money is invested?  The show makers
Whos time is being wasted?  Yours!
And whose mental state is being affected?
When Honey Singh is asked about his misogynist songs
he replies that its just entertainment
That it is what the public wants
If you ask the showmakers of Bigg Boss
about what they are showing to the public
he will also reply similarly
The same excuse is used
that its just entertainment
The public wants this  thats why they show it
Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment
Friends the thing is watching such things can affect you too
Psychiatrist Dr Marcia Sirota claims that
just like our teeth and health are affected by junk food
bad reality TV shows
affects our brains
and we become ruder
When people see the reality TV shows
and how celebrities become rich and famous on it
by abusing people
doing weird things
and by becoming selfserving egoistics
the audience is convinced by this perception
The audience starts believing that if they want to earn money and fame
then this is the best way
Doing such cheap things
Telecasting their personal life on national TV
Insulting bullying and roasting other people
Brian Gibson a psychologist at Central Michigan University
did a study and concluded that
watching such reality TV shows
leads to an increase in aggression in the viewers
Comparing to violent media and crime TV shows
reality TV shows cause a higher increase than them
An effect on the mental health of the contestants is also evident
Many contestants have said that
after the show they had to deal with so many mental health issues
Many contestants who were so determined to win
that they reveal their personal secrets
later regretted doing so
Some contestants are made into villains in the public perception
even though they are not that bad in real life
Then the public criticism that people have to face after coming on the show
that causes a lot of anxiety among the contestants
Shamita Shetty Sana Khan Kushal Tandon
Nikki Tamboli Kavita Kaushik Shalin Bhanot
Rahul Vaidya Himanshi Khurana
Apurva Agnihotri and Shilpa Shaklani
are the examples of those people
who faced mental health issues after going on the show
and after the show they had to take therapy
So I request everyone
to not treat their brain like a dustbin
Your brain is not a dustbin
that you can keep throwing any rubbish into it
The content you are consuming
choose it wisely
The type of entertainment you are consuming
think about what effect it is having on you
Does it have a positive impact on your life or a negative impact?
And I am not saying that you should always consume intellectual content
Even if you want to consume nonintellectual entertainment
think about it first
Will it have a positive or negative impact on you?

On the morning of November 12 2023
while we were preparing for Diwali
in a tunnel in Uttarkashi
41 workers were working
on building a highway project
Around 530 in the morning
this tunnel collapsed suddenly
The workers were trapped in the tunnel
With no way out
The collapsed wall of stones and mud  standing between them and their way out
was 60 meters long
Soon a concerned group of people  gathered in this small city in Uttarakhand
The next day on November 13th
the rescue mission began officially
involving over 200 individuals
It took 17 days of intensive efforts to  successfully extricate the trapped workers
How did they achieve this feat?
Lets understand the entire rescue operation  in todays video with 3D animations
Furthermore lets answer the biggest question
What is the underlying cause of the incident?
The root cause is the same that is faced by Joshimath
a situation often overlooked  by mainstream news channels
Lets begin
The incident unfolded in Uttarkashi district in Uttarakhand
specifically in the BarkotSilkyara tunnel
this map shows its location
This is a twolane bidirectional tunnel
being constructed as a part of the Modi  Governments 120 billion Char Dham project
Lets talk about the details of the project later in the video
but broadly speaking
this is a highway project connecting 4 North Indian Dhams
Badrinath Kedarnath  Yamunotri and Gangotri
Roads will be built connecting these four dhams
to reduce the travelling distance between them
PM Modi laid the foundation stone  of this project in December 2016
This particular tunnel was announced in February 2018
under the BrahmakhalYamunotri National Highway section
The purpose of this tunnel was to reduce  the distance between Gangotri and Yamnotri
by approximately 20 km and  45 minutes of travel time
The estimated cost of the project is 1383 billion
overseen by Navyug Engineering Company Limited
under the guidance of
the National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited
From the Silkyara side 2340 meters  of construction was nearly over
And from Barkot 1600 meters was constructed
The collapsed tunnel section was situated  270 meters from the Silkyara entrance
the debris from the collapse formed a 60 meters thick wall
Fortunately since 2000 meters of the tunnel was already constructed
the trapped labourers
had a space of 2000 meters to stretch their legs
Fortunately they werent trapped in a small space
The height of the enclosure they were trapped in was 85 meters
Typically incidents of this nature are
classified as Act of God
signifying that it was a natural disaster
However the degree to which these events are  influenced by natural and human factors
is a subject of ongoing discussion
As per the governments press release
the workers were engaged in reprofiling work
a process involving adjustments to the tunnel structure
This activity becomes necessary when
the surrounding rocks exhibit unexpected  behaviours that went unnoticed previously
The exact cause of the collapse will  remains unknown until further research
However preliminary findings suggest
this collapse was due to a potential geological fault
known as the Shear Zone
This refers to a thinner or weaker part of the Earths crust
The construction would have put  a strain on the surrounding rocks
leading to a landslide
Another consideration as stated by  ML Sharma a professor from IIT Roorkee
is the presence of undetected cavities in the rocks
gaps between these mountain rocks
These cavities naturally weaken such areas
increasing the risk of landslides
These are 2 possible causes
but we can only speculate right now
and the definitive reason will be established  only after the completion of investigation reports
There are two main approaches to constructing  a tunnel construction in mountainous terrain
the first is the drill and blast method DBM
and the second is by using a tunnel boring machine TBM
The former involves drilling holes in stones
placing explosives
and literally blasting the rocks
Its as if a small bomb is detonated from inside the rocks
It is the simple and traditional approach
Using the tunnel boring machine is a more expensive
but safer alternative
The machine creates a hole in the rocks with a rotating head
and precast concrete segments are then installed
Unfortunately in the Himalayan mountains  we cannot use these machines
Due to the extreme geological conditions
As you have studied in school
the Himalayas are the youngest mountain ranges in the world
At only 4050 million years old
they continue to grow
resulting in highly sensitive  and unpredictable conditions
Consequently accidents in these areas  resulting from extensive construction
cannot be solely attributed to Act of God
Nevertheless even in challenging situations  people often seek a divine explanation
Consider this article
where a local resident claims that there  was a Baba Baukh Naths temple on the site
which was removed to make way  for the highway construction
He claims that this was the cause of the incident
Attempts to find a divine cause behind  natural or manmade disasters
are not unprecedented
In the case of the 2013 Kedarnath floods
some locals attributed the calamity to  the relocation of Dhari Devis shrine
during the construction of  the Alaknanda Hydroelectric Project
During the rescue efforts in the tunnel  where over 200 people were involved
a small temple was constructed at the  entrance of the tunnel on November 18th
and rituals were conducted
Interestingly this initiative wasnt  undertaken by the locals
but by NHIDCL
the same company overseeing the tunnel construction
However neither the temple
nor the subsequent rescue operation  would have been needed
had an emergency escape passage  been incorporated as per the original plan
When the Government sanctioned this project
they had clearly stipulated the necessity of an escape passage
a way out in case of emergency was mandatory
as per government guidelines
such emergency exits
are recommended for every tunnel  exceeding 15 km in length
PC Nawani the former director of the  Geological Survey of India emphasizes that
managing projects of this nature  without escape routes is impractical
The entire incident could have been  averted had proper precautions been taken
But anyhow lets get back to the incident
the truth was the workers were trapped indeed
How could they be rescued?
This marked the beginning of Operation Zindagi Operation Life
Uttarakhand government formed a fiveoption rescue plan
to be carried out by five distinct agencies
Oil and Natural Gas Corporation ONGC
Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam SJVNL
Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd RVNL
National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd NHIDCL
and Tehri Hydro Development Corporation THDCL
Additionally the Border Roads Organisation BRO
and the National Disaster Response Force NDRF
stood ready on the sidelines
offering assistance whenever required
The first step in the rescue operation focused on
ensuring a continuous oxygen supply to the trapped individuals
so that they could breathe properly
A compressed air pipe was manoeuvred  between the debris for this
Simultaneously a separate 4inch pipe was passed through the debris
to deliver snacks and dry fruits
These measures were implemented  on the first day November 12th
Notably electricity was being supplied in the tunnel
so the trapped individuals werent in complete darkness
There was some light
The following day a rescue plan was devised
involving horizontal drilling to create a passage
and passing a pipe through it
that would be big enough for people  to crawl through and escape
They had planned for horizontal drilling
Using an auger machine
This is how the machine looks
Since the first pipe had been passed on the first day
it was possible to communicate with the trapped workers
allowing constant interaction and  encouragement from the people outside
THDC operated from the other side of the tunnel
using microtunneling techniques
Additionally SJVN and ONGC were  gearing up for vertical drilling if necessary
Vertical drilling meant drilling a passage  from the top of the mountain to the tunnel
However geologists expressed reservations about vertical drilling
due to potential complications with weak stones
which could lead to further issues or even a landslide
If it wasnt executed perfectly
On 14th November horizontal drilling commenced
but the slow progress of the machine being used
and the additional debris caused by the drilling
led to the wall of debris becoming longer

Returning to our main topic
on November 15th
a decision was made to bring in  a new powerful machine
This machine transported from Delhi   via millitary aircraft in 3 parts
had to be assembled
It took a day
So by November 16th
the machine was ready for digging
with the capability to excavate 5 meters of debris per hour
While the initial day went smoothly
operations had to be halted the following day
due to a concerning cracking sound from the tunnel
The fear arose  could continued drilling  lead to further sinking of the tunnel?
A day was dedicated to thorough inspection
by then five days had passed
with no visible progress
The frustration among the workers relatives  and rescue officials escalated
resulting in a heated confrontation
One distressed person cried out about  his brother who was trapped for seven days
People were so angry and agitated that
to pacify the growing anger
Uttarkashi District Officer DP Baluni proposed
the idea of vertical drilling
People are agitated
so it was decided to
provide vertical openings  in addition to horizontal openings
for the rescue operation
The plan with respect to vertical drilling involved
digging a passage for 90 to 105 meters
Here the BRO played a crucial role  in constructing temporary roads
so that the drilling machines  could be transported to the top
This was being done simultaneously
preparations for vertical drilling began
along with the ongoing horizontal drilling from below
A significant development occurred on 20th November
when Arnold Dix a tunneling expert
and the president of the International Tunneling  and Underground Space Association
joined the rescue operation
Leveraging his expertise  Dix provided valuable suggestions
about what should be done next
On the same evening
rescuers successfully inserted a pipe of  6inch diameter through the wall of debris
This development expanded possibilities
since this pipe was wider
proper food could be delivered  to the trapped individuals
The workers received their first hot meal since they were trapped
a serving of hot khichdi
An endoscopic camera was passed  through the pipe to film the workers
This was the first video where we could see them
Beyond food the pipe became a conduit for medicines  mobile phones chargers and walkietalkies
The walkietalkies enabled direct  communication with the workers
On the same day it was decided to dig two additional tunnels
to create additional escape routes
By 21st November
four 900 mm pipes had been  successfully inserted through the debris
However the rescue operation was  still far from being successful
with the pipes interfering with the drilling
This interference led to a slight delay on November 22
Further setbacks occurred on November 23
when the platform upon which  the drilling machine was placed
had weakened
that night was spent repairing that structure
By November 24 the drilling machine had to be reassembled
and the sequence of challenges persisted
Once something was set right  something other broke down
On November 25 a significant setback unfolded
as the auger machine completely broke down
and was lodged in the tunnel
Arnold Dix informed reporters that
the drilling machine had already broken  down thrice during the rescue operations
and was now completely destroyed
The Auger is broken
Broken? Yeah broken
Yeah the machine is busted
Its irreparable
It is destructed
No more work from Auger
On November 26 authorities announced
their intention to attempt vertical drilling again
By then 20 meters had been drilled vertically
but the primary focus remained on horizontal drilling
with only 12 meters of drilling left
Recognizing the machines irreparable state  on November 27 a decision was made
to resort to manual drilling
by bringing in rat hole miners
Rat hole mining an old and  hazardous coal extraction method
was used in the past
It involved creating vertical passages by hand
The passage would be barely big  enough for a person to pass through it
Despite being banned in India by the National Green Tribunal
due to its adverse environmental impact
and the unsafe conditions for the miners
in this situation it was deemed the  best option for this rescue operation
A team of 12 rat hole mining experts worked diligently
and by the evening of November 28
it was reported that only 2 meters of digging remained
Everyone waited for the good news with bated breaths
and finally around 8 in the evening
the first worker was successfully  brought out on a stretcher
Subsequently one by one all 41 workers  were rescued from this tunnel
After 17 days of being trapped in  the collapsed tunnel in Northern India
rescuers have now freed all 41 workers
Munna Qureshi was one of these 12 rathole mining expert
he said that it was an emotional moment
He was the one who removed the last piece of debris
He could see them once he removed the last piece
He said that those workers hugged them
and thanked them once they were safely outside
They worked incessantly for 24 hours to rescue the workers
Qureshi said that his happiness knew no bounds
and that he did it for his country
Ambulances and helicopters stood ready outside
the rescued workers were adorned with garlands
and a freshly cooked meal awaited them
Potatoes and cauliflower stew roti lentil soup and rice
were served to them as they emerged
The entire nation celebrated the safe rescue of these 41 workers
and praises poured in for the rescuers
However amidst the celebration for  this happy ending it is crucial not to forget
the underlying cause of the incident
and the need to address its root cause
Waiting for an official investigation may not be necessary
as the actual reasons behind the incident are already known
The answer to the question lies within
the Char Dham Highway project
The same reason that is contributing  to the sinking of Joshimath
This socalled development in Uttarakhand
exemplified by projects like Char Dham adversely impacting the environment
escalating the risk of landslides and related accidents
I am not making this up look at this article
Tunnel collapse in Uttarakhand is a part  of a bigger problem in the Himalayas
In the construction of roads there was inadequate slope analysis
There is extreme slope cutting at some places
slopes have been cut up to 45 degrees to construct the roads
This can cause landslides easily
In fact the region has witnessed an average  of one landslide per day over the past 2 years
According to this article
Environmental activists have  raised concerns about this project
In February 2018
Citizens for Green Doon an NGO based in Dehradun
lodged a complaint with the National Green Tribunal NGT
highlighting the catastrophic impact of  this project on the Himalayan ecology
They pointed out that at that time 25000 trees  had already been felled for the project
violating the Forest Conservation Act
Furthermore the NGO emphasized that
according to Indian environmental laws
every highway project exceeding 100 km
requires an environmental impact assessment
However the government  unabashedly circumvented this regulation
they said that this wasnt a mega project  of thousands of kilometers of highways
they claimed to undertake 53 smaller projects
each highway with a length of  less than 100 kilometers
This mega project was presented as a cluster of small projects
simply to bypass this law
Consequently in September 2018 the NGT ruled that
the project did not need an environmental clearance
This order was later contested in the  Supreme Court of India in August 2019
leading to the appointment of a  26member HighPowered Committee
led by environmentalist Ravi Chopra
The committee had to investigate the potential  environmental and social ramifications
of this project in Uttarakhand
and provide recommendations based on their findings
In July 2020 the 4 members of this committee including Ravi Chopra
took note of the governments guidelines from March 2018
issued by the Ministry of Road and Transport Highways
These guidelines specified that highways constructed on mountains
should not exceed a total width of 7 meters
However the government aimed for  12meterswide highways on these mountains
The other 21 committee members  supported the governments plan
In response Ravi Chopra directly wrote to  the Environment Ministry in August 2020
expressing concern beyond tree felling
He emphasized that in addition to cutting down trees and mountains
the waste generated during road construction
was being indiscriminately dumped into rivers
particularly in ecosensitive zones
such as Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary
Valley of Flowers National Park
and Rajaji National Park
Waste was being dumped at such places
The following month in September 2020
the Supreme Court considered  Ravi Chopras recommendation
and ruled that the highways width  should not exceed 7 meters
This made sense as
wider roads would necessitate
more slope cutting tree removal
and more waste being dumped
which could destabilise the Himalayan terrain
and increase the chances of  landslides and flash floods
We observed unanimously
that the road width was the key factor
which determines the extent of hillcutting
and the subsequent environmental damage
However instead of adhering to the Supreme Courts decision the government
employed a new masterstroke
to circumvent the Supreme Courts direction
In November 2020 the Ministry of Defence entered the scene
appealing to the Supreme Court for
the construction of a doublelane road
citing it as a necessity for the Army
The Char Dham project was reframed
asserting that it was essential for  the countrys benefit and the Army
Thats why the roads had to be so wide
While the public had been initially informed
that the road construction was for the  Char Dham Yatra and religious pilgrimage
the projects purpose was suddenly recast
as a strategic imperative
Rooted in national interest
specifically facilitating the movement  of Indian troops to the Chinese border
The new reason was that since China
was constructing roads on its side of the border
India needed to do the same
However a major difference is the terrain
Chinas territory lies on the Tibetan Plateau
characterized by fewer mountains
a relatively stable landscape
building roads is easier there
with fewer adverse ecological impacts
Following this appeal by the Ministry of Defence
the Ministry of Highways modified its  2018 directives the subsequent month
stating that the 7meter guideline
could be expanded to 10 meters
if a project holds strategic importance
A year later on December 14 2021
the Supreme Court reluctantly approved
the continuation of the Char Dham project as it is
Consequently the highways in the  Char Dham project are 12 meters wide
Looking at how unabashedly the government
has disregarded rules and guidelines for this project
Ravi Chopra resigned from the committee
As of today the Char Dham project has  resulted in the clearance of 600 hectares of forest
the felling of over 56000 trees
and the widening of 75 of the Char Dham highway
The Ministry of Highways acknowledged  200 landslides in the area in 2021
And in November 2021 they admitted to the Supreme Court that
125 landslides were triggered around  the route of the Char Dham project
attributed to the construction work
Do you recall what I said in the video on Bhopal Gas Tragedy?
Before the incident journalists activists and experts
gave repeated warnings that
disaster may strike at any moment
Similarly experts and activists are giving warning repeatedly now
Look at these headlines
17th May 2023

Look at this article from 2018
Frequent landslides in Uttarakhand on  Char Dham yatra marg raises questions
In light of this data and warnings
there are no indications of the plan being modified
The government is celebrating the rescue of the tunnel workers
There are indications that tunnel work will resume
in the coming years we might get more news
of more such incidents in Uttarakhand

20th July 1969
The Lunar Module of the Apollo 11 mission landed on the moon
Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were in it
After the landing Neil Armstrong tried to open the door
to get down on the moon
It wasnt easy opening this door
due to high pressure
but he successfully opened it after a little struggle
Then he tried to get down to the moon in his heavy spacesuit
The exit wasnt spacious
so by mistake he hit the top and a piece of the Lunar Module broke off
Neither of them was aware of this
because of the lack of air
The sound didnt travel
They didnt hear any sound
But this broken piece was very crucial
It was the Assent Engine Arming Switch
Without this switch their Lunar Module couldnt take off again
and they couldnt return to Earth
Unaware of this Neil Armstrong got out
and stepped on the moons surface
He became the first man to step on the moon
one giant leap for mankind
But did it actually happen?
Today more than 50 years later
many people refuse to believe that humans had gone to the moon
People cook up theories of their own
to claim that the entire Apollo 11 mission was a farce put up by America
That they filmed the scenes on Earth
and lied to the world
How else do you explain the flag fluttering without air?
Whats the truth to it?
Come lets try to understand this story
All engines running
We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do other things
not because they are easy but because they are hard
Tranquillity Base here
The Eagle has landed!
Friends youd be surprised to know
the real reason why Apollo 11 mission was planned
was a war
Specifically speaking the Cold War
Fought between America and the Soviet Union
Both countries were engaged in a Space Race
In 1957 the Soviet Union became the first country
to launch the first artificial satellite
It was named Sputnik  and it was the first manmade object
to be placed in Earths orbit
The American government was shocked to see the Soviets getting ahead
Months later in 1958 America launched their satellite as well
But 3 years later in 1961
America got another shock
Soviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin
was the first person to go to space
The Soviets beat America once again
One week later the then President of America
John F Kennedy
wrote a letter to the Vice President
dated 20th April 1961
He asked the Vice President how they could beat the Soviet Union
by putting a laboratory in space
or by a trip around the moon
Are we working 24 hours a day on existing programs?
If not why not?
Are we making the maximum effort?
Asking if there was another space program that could be achieved quickly
that would produce dramatic results and give them a lead in the race
He got the answer some days later
because he soon realised that
the next big step would be to send humans to the moon
On 25th May 1961
in his famous speech he promised the world
that he would send humans to the moon before the end of the decade
Not only this he also promised to
get the humans back on Earth safely
Before this decade is out
of landing a man on the moon
and returning him safely to the Earth
For many this was an unbelievable announcement
Friends imagine 1961
There were no smartphones no internet
there wasnt even GPS technology
The computers were so slow and old
in such times he was promising
to send humans to the moon
For this over the next 5 years
he provided 79 billion in additional funding to the space program
The entire space agency was engaged in fulfilling this one aim
Mere months later the tests began
First they tested the rockets
that would be used to leave the Earth
Then the heat shields of the command modules were tested
How much theyd be able to resist heat
Then the propulsion system of the service module
Between 1963 to 1967
many unmanned tests were carried out
The rockets didnt carry any humans
during the tests
In February 1967
the planned the first manned tests
A test in which astronauts will go up to space in the rockets
This was the Apollo 1 mission
But during the tests on Earth
on 27th January 1967
the cabin caught on fire
and the three astronauts preparing to go to space
died in the fire
After this painful event NASA didnt lose courage
Instead it continued further testing
Apollo 4 Apollo 5 and Apollo 6
were all unmanned missions
for further testing
In October 1968 Apollo 7 mission was launched
and once again they attempted to
send humans to space
This was successful
Only 2 months later in December 1968
Apollo 8 mission was launched
in which three astronauts were sent near the moon
Three months later in March 1969
Apollo 9 mission was launched
In this the lunar module was tested
The part of the spacecraft that was actually going to land on the moon
And 2 months after that in May 1969
was the Apollo 10 mission
In this mission 3 astronauts
had to do almost everything for practice
that was supposed to be done in Apollo 11 mission
except actually landing on the moon
Look at the speed with which NASA
was launching the missions one after the other
In the gap of 2 to 3 months
a new mission to test the next thing
Testing the rockets spacecraft
going to the moon
and after all these tests
finally on 16th July 1969
Apollo 11 mission was launched
All engine running
Liftoff we have a liftoff
32 minutes past the hour
Liftoff of Apollo 11
Three astronauts were a part of this mission
38yearold commander Neil Armstrong
he led this mission
The pilot of the Command Module Michael Collins
And the pilot of the Lunar Module Edwin Buzz Aldrin
These three names are inscribed in the pages of history
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin become famous names
everyone knows them today
But Michael Collins isnt very popular
the reason for this is very interesting Ill tell you later in this video
The spacecraft of this Apollo 11 mission
had three main parts
The Command Module Service Module and the Lunar Module
The first two are collectively known as CSM
Command and Service Module
They aimed to detach the Lunar Module and have it land on the moon
And to return the Lunar Module would have to be
relaunched and attached to the CSM
to enable the astronauts to return to Earth
To launch this spacecraft a Saturn V5 rocket was to be used
Before the launch the rocket was loaded with
1 million gallon of Kerosene Liquid Oxygen and Liquid Hydrogen
The weight of this rocket was 3 million kg
With its help the spacecraft reached Earths orbit
It took less than 10 minutes to reach the orbit
Then they made about 15 revolutions around the Earth
after which they were given the permission from the mission control
the mission control was of course based on Earth
they communicated their permission to begin TransLunar Injection
ie taking the spacecraft out of Earths orbit and towards Moons orbit
To leave Earths orbit the Saturn V5 rocket was used
This was the third stage for the rocket
These events took place within 5 hours of the launch
But to actually reach the moon took several days
Astronauts waited in the spacecraft
the ate slept and took pictures of themselves and their surroundings
19th July 1969
After travelling for almost 400000 km
The Apollo 11 spacecraft reached moons orbit
Here it was supposed to be split into 2
The Command and Service Module separated from the Lunar Module
Michael Collins was in the Command Module
This part of the spacecraft was nicknamed Columbia
And the Lunar Module was nicknamed the Eagle
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were in it
The thing is that the command and service module
was tasked to remain in the moons orbit
Only the lunar module was going to land on the moon
It meant that only Armstrong and Aldrin had the chance to step on the moon
and not Michael Collins
Perhaps this is the reason why not many people know Michael Collins
Even though he was a part of the Apollo mission
he did not step on the moon
But even so Michael Collins part in this mission
was perhaps the most important
Because the Lunar Module was supposed to be reattached to the CSM
Without Michael Collins
Armstrong and Aldrin could not have returned safely
Around 8 PM the Lunar Module was going to land on the moon
Exactly at 810 PM
alarms went off
1201 and 1202 alarms
1201 1201
Roger 1201 alarm
Neither Armstrong nor Aldrin knew
the meaning of this alarm
They asked the mission control what they ought to do next
Mission control tells them to ignore it and keep going
Were GO Same type Were GO
Later they figured out that 1202 was a warning
The processing system of the guidance computer of the Apollo was overloaded
But thankfully the computer was designed in a way that
the essential programs which were critical for the mission
would continue despite being overloaded
The computer was installed with the program for automatic landing
This would automatically land the Lunar Module on Moons surface
But at the height of 150 metres
Neil Armstrong took over the control
He noticed that the Lunar Module was going to land at a place where
huge boulders were strewn about
The landing spot was changed then
And they decided on another spot 4 miles from the predetermined landing spot
for the actual landing
At 816 PM
Buzz Aldrin checked the fuel indicator
Only 5 fuel remained
100 feet 312 down 9 forward
5 per cent
Seeing the low level of fuel the mission control initiated a countdown
The countdown to decide whether they should land or abort the mission
Now were at critical fuel state
And thats why the 60second call is given
And then the 30second call
Finally literally at the last minute
with only 30 seconds remaining in this countdown
Neil Armstrong sent a radio message to Earth
Roger Tranquility
The Eagle had successfully landed
Then Neil Armstrong put on his spacesuit opened the door
and stepped on the moon
This moment was watched by 650 million people on television
His first words were televised to the world
Buzz Aldrin followed him on the moons surface
and for the next 25 hours
they collected samples of the moons dust and rocks
took photographs
set up several scientific instruments as well
Although it is true that the Cold War was a big reason for this moon landing
but because the moon landing was already planned
it was such a huge achievement so obviously
they were carrying scientific instruments with them
There were several scientific objectives of this mission as well
They set up a television camera on the moon
to transmit signals to the Earth
They took a device with them to measure the solar winds reaching the moon
They installed a device to send laser beams to the Earth
So that the laser beams could be used
to compute the exact distance between Earth and Moon
They also had a passive seismometer
To measure the earthquakes on the moon
Of course theyre called Moonquakes
They collected 23 kg of rock and dust from the moon
And they left behind an American flag
And a plate with the inscription
Here Men from the Planet Earth
First set foot upon the Moon
July 1969 AD
The Lunar Module had to remain on the moon for 21 hours
After this it had to take off once again
and attach to the CSM
But to go up they needed propulsion
And for that they needed an engine
Both Armstrong and Aldrin were unaware that
the switch to turn on the engine
had broken off while they were getting out
I told you this at the beginning of the video
When they came back to the Lunar Module
they realised what had happened
They informed the mission control about this damage
and look for a solution to resolve the situation
They come up with an interesting solution to the problem
Now what exactly is a switch?
Switch basically works to complete an electrical circuit
Buzz Aldrin realised that if the circuit is broken
They looked for something that could be used
to complete the circuit once again
When he looked around he noticed his ballpoint pen
He used that ballpoint pen to complete the circuit
and to reignite the engine
Finally the Lunar Module was reattached to the CSM
and the three astronauts turn the spacecraft towards Earth
The plan for landing on Earth was that
The Command Module and the Service Module would be separated
The service module would then be destroyed due to Earths atmosphere
But there was a danger that if the service module was damaged severely
with its debris floating all around
they may hit the command module
killing the astronauts on board
To avoid this NASA installed thrusters in the Service Module
To take it far from the Command Module
So that they do not collide with each other
But when the astronauts were returning to Earth
they found out that the thrusters on the Service Module werent working
The three astronauts could only sit in the Command Module
and watch the service module break apart around them
Its debris was floating all around them
It was a miracle that the broken pieces
did not hit the command module
And the command module remains safe
The risk of the astronauts dying on this mission was so high that
the US President Nixon had prepared an alternate speech
in case the astronauts were indeed killed
Can you imagine an alternate speech?
In it he had written
Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace
will stay on the moon to rest in peace
These brave men Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin
know that there is no hope for their recovery
These two men are laying down their lives
in mankinds most noble goal
The search for truth and understanding
But thankfully this wasnt needed
The Command Module safely descended the Earths atmosphere
The parachutes were deployed and it landed in the ocean
All three astronauts were alive and safe
These astronauts were then evacuated by rescue ships from the ocean
It was truly a miracle that they could return alive
It wasnt that the mission had gone exactly as it was planned
They had to face problems at almost every step
They successfully dealt with the problems
and they could return alive
It is interesting to note that
after returning the three astronauts were quarantined for 2 weeks
They werent allowed to be in contact with other humans
Because of the risk of them carrying pathogens
Viruses or bacteria that they might have encountered on moon
that could possibly wreck havoc on Earth
No one knew for sure
But again thankfully nothing of the sort happened
Apollo 11s moon landing was the top news in newspapers worldwide
The US President Kennedys promise
of having humans land on the moon before the end of the decade
was made possible by NASA
In 1969 the public had little reason to question
mankinds historic first step on the moon
After all the achievement was a celebration of
technological supremacy
America had finally won the Space Race
Isnt it very suspicious
that the decade that was about to end in 1970
a year before that in 1969 America had reached the moon?
It cant be that to have an advantage in the Cold War
America planned a fake moon landing operation can it?
That their actual moon landing mission failed
and they planned this fake mission as backup
for the world to see
Friends this is just one example of the many conspiracy theories
that is based on the moon landing
But friends the truth is that these conspiracy theories
have already been debunked several times
If this was a fake attempt by America to fool the world
the Soviets would never have acknowledged it
But in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia published between 19701979
in its Third Edition
this moon landing was said to be factual multiple times
Soviet articles have even been written
that the Apollo landing was the third historic event of the space age
First was Sputniks launch in 1957
Second Yuri Gagarins flight in 1961
And the third was the moon landing
The Soviet Union had actually acknowledged this
But then what about the flag?
The flag which was planted on the moon
why was it fluttering?
There is no air on the moon
There is a simple reason for that friends
The flag that Armstrong and Aldrin had taken to the moon
was a specially designed flag
Normal flags have one long vertical rod
But there was a horizontal rod in this too
Right at the top of the flag
So that the flag would always be extended out
Because everyone working at NASA knew that
if a flag is planted on the moon
it wouldnt flutter due to the lack of wind
So they decided to add a horizontal rod at the top
so that the flag could always be properly visible
But on this Apollo 11 mission
there were some problems extending this horizontal rod
So this couldnt be extended till the end
Which caused the ripple that we see
There were waves in the flag
Thats why people think that the flag is fluttering
But actually the flag isnt fluttering
You can see the flag fluttering only in the videos where
the astronauts are holding it and making it move
The reason for this is that
the aluminium rods in the flag
were acting as springs
So the flag would move for a little while and then remain still
The third most popular theory is that
in the photos taken by Armstrong and Aldrin
stars arent visible
The answer to this is very simple
The moon landing took place in the day
At a time when the sunlight was hitting the moon
And the white spacesuits that were worn by the astronauts
were very reflective too
The cameras back then didnt have such resolution to see beyond reflections
Even today take any phones camera
and try to take a pic at night
if the flash is turned on
you wont see the stars in the background
Another theory is about the shadows
About the inconsistency in the angles of the shadows
People argue that since this was like a Hollywood film
They didnt have just a single source of light
Thats why the shadows are going all over the place
But in reality the Sun was not the only source of light
The moons surface was also acting as a complementary source of light
because it was reflecting so much light
This is why the light scattered in all directions
and the shadows were so bizarre
Another question is raised about Buzz Aldrins photo taken by Neil Armstrong
It shows Armstrongs reflection
but you can see a camera in his hand
How could this happen?
Its because he wasnt holding the camera in his hand
instead the camera was mounted on his suit
And he could control it from there
But then who took the photos of Neil Armstrong descending from the Lunar Module?
Again a simple answer
multiple cameras were installed on the Lunar Module
But moving beyond these mindless theories
if we talk about actual criticism
Friends not everyone was applauding the moon landing
commending NASAs work
many people strongly criticised NASA
and the American government after the moon landing
People were already criticising it before the moon landing
In January 1962 the New York Times published an article
in which they revealed that the money being spent to go on the moon
could have been used to build at least 120 Harvardsized universities
They questioned whether so much money should be spent to go to the moon
or should they open a Harvardsized university in every US state?
Werent there better ways to spend that money?
Basically the main point of criticism was that
there were so many problems in the country
education income inequality
back then America was also facing the consequences of the Vietnam War
So why was so much money wasted on this?
But in reality there were many hidden benefits of the moon landing
that no one had even thought about
Such as the advancements in computer chips
In 1962 it had been 3 years since microchips were invented
And IBM had decided that in the early 1960s
they wouldnt use these chips in their computers
It has the packaged integrated circuit
Inside this package is a chip of silicon
which provides the electrical equivalent
of many transistors resistors and diodes
all interconnected to provide the desired function
But since NASA put in so many orders to buy integrated circuits
IBM started working on it
and because of the heavy demand
its price fell by more than 90 over the next 5 years
And so NASA tested whether we can rely on computers
for the safety of human lives
If astronauts could go to the moon and back
by relying on these computer chips
we can obviously rely on these computer chips for our daily lives
The technology grew exponentially after this moon landing
Even so only 3 years after the Apollo 11 mission
in December 1972
the last moon mission Apollo 17 took place
Since then friends
It has been almost 50 years
no other person went to the moon during these 50 years
Perhaps this is the biggest proof
about how expensive the Apollo program was
More than 400000 engineers scientists and technicians had worked on it
and the total cost back then was 24 billion
In todays money the cost is more than 100 billion
Initially it was criticised by journalists only
But by 1972
the average persons fascination with NASA
and the moon had ended
As the Vietnam War continued
the problems of the citizens were on the rise
Thousands of demonstrators opposed to the Vietnam War
assemble in the nations capital for a mass protest
They saw the space program as a waste of money
Even though NASA had plans for missions up to Apollo 20
politicians had to heed the citizens
and the money being spent on space programs
had to be cut down
In December 2017 former President Donald Trump said that
he would increase the funding
so that humans could be sent back to the moon by 2024
returning American astronauts to the moon
for the first time since 1972
for longterm exploration and use this time
But later he changed his statement and said that
NASA should focus on Mars rather than on the moon
But 50 years later now NASA has made plans again
to send people to the moon
Their new Artemis program
They would begin testing with unmanned rockets
but NASA plans that by 20252026
they would send the first woman to the moon
After which they plan to send the first person of colour to the moon as well
One thing can be said for sure
Before the end of this decade
we will see humans back on the moon

by clicking on this playlist
The videos cover many such interesting topics
Lets meet in the next video
Friends when you imagine the Middle East
you probably think of deserts
But Oman is quite special
It has date palm forests
and tall mountains
Here you can swim with turtles
and in Oman you can also see
one of the most dangerous forts in the world
A fort that could never be breached by an enemy
Because its defence system was so immaculate
that youll be shocked to see it
The security system of this fort
was truly amazing back then
If you tried to enter the fort from this gate
the soldiers could throw rocks from above to k!ll you
So even before you enter
you can see the first post
from where they would throw rocks on you
If you escape this
you will reach the Pitfall 1
where they would throw hot oil or date syrup on you
The date syrup
Thats where the hot oil would be poured on you
So you better be quick to escape it
Now theyve covered this with glass
or else you could have fallen into the pit
When you would run from the hot oil
you would fall into this pit
And if you escaped it too
you would reach the Pitfall 2
They could drop something from here
the Mrder Hole 2 is right above it
You could fall into this pit and perish
Catch enemies off guard
in the dark passageway
It was dark
there were no lamps like here
So some of the stairs had wooden planks
that could be removed to expose
deep gaping pits
And then you would be at the third pitfall
And the fourth after that
And the fifth
So not just once but
you would have to escape five times
if you want to breach this fort
Weve safely escaped 2 pitfalls
Lets move on to the third pitfall
Oh! This is the third pitfall
As soon as you open this door
you have this door here
as soon as you step through it  youll fall into the pitfall
Theres a door before every pitfall
These people were so clever
the doors would be closed
and when you try to open the doors
they will pour oil on you
and if you manage to open it
you will fall into the pit
And after passing through all these stages
I dont know if there has  been a single intruder in history
who reached the top
If he did
this is the view he would have seen
These are the places
from where you would pour the hot oil
It can really go deep inside
300 years ago
Nizwa was the capital of Oman
Thats why today
Nizwa is an important tourist attraction
The city of Nizwa
And this fort
back then the Sultan of Oman
lived here and ruled over Oman
The best thing about Oman
in comparison to the other Middle Eastern countries
is that this is a sparsely populated country
Wherever you go there wont be a crowd
Youll see very few people
So you can take your time to explore everything
Like you can see the fort
this is a major tourist attraction
but you can hardly see anyone else here
Im the guy who has been assigned
the duty of throwing the stones today
Oh youre throwing the stones today?
On the intruders
Okay Ill be the one who pours the oil then
Ill be over here okay?
The wood on the door
this is the same wood from those days
This is walnut wood
Even in their shooting style
they had some nice designs
Like if someone was close to the fort
and they had to shoot him
this is the slit theyd use
so that they could shoot downwards
But if the target was far
this is the hole for that
they could shoot from here
And theres another angle here
So they could shoot in three different angles
These 3 angles were all around 360 of the fort
So you can imagine the
level of protection of this fort
Theres a well in this castle fort
Look at how deep it goes
You can see my reflection at the bottom
Oh my God Zoom in
This is a big area
that includes the Nizwa Souq Nizwa Fort
a historical wall
that was used to protect the fort from enemies
Were walking on this wall now
You can see some old buildings here
some parts are being renovated
some have been renovated already
But look at how extraordinary it looks
It feels like you have timetravelled  to 2000 years into the past
Dont be distracted by my cap
theres Australia written on it
I wore this because I didnt have any other caps
And its too sunny here
And if you remember the Australia vlogs
I got this cap for free in Australia
so Im wearing this cap
After this we went to the Nizwa Souq
The old city market
that looks like a historical place
Omani dates
Look at the varieties here
Less sweets ones okay
There are dates everywhere
You will know the difference  between this one and that
This ones good right? I like this
I think this is the fourth variety Ive tried
At home mostly we have the Medjool ones
There are more than 200 varieties of dates in Oman
They have so many types of dates in this shop
Youll be exhausted by the time youve tried them all
They have seedless dates
date honey
and the tahini sauce to dip the dates
This machine is making sesame sauce
The sesame seeds are put into it
And this machine is grinding the seeds
to make the sauce
You can see it here
And the sauce then drips into this pot  where it is collected
Oh wow theres so much sauce
You can smell it also
They have given us this sample to try
Pure tahini sauce
It is warm!
The contrast between  this sauce and the dates
tastes quite good
because it tastes a bit sour
and the dates are sweet
So when the tastes mix
it makes a good snack
So we decided to buy 1 packet of dates
But they actually gifted it to us
They would not accept any payment
Very very sweet
Though it was pretty affordable to be honest
0800 Rial 208 or 17235
800 Baiza
A Rial is divided into 1000 Baiza
This dagger that you see here
this is the logo of Oman
Even on Omans flag
theres a dagger in a corner
In ceremonies and special occasions
people carry such daggers
If you are interested in visiting Oman
you can try Gainwell Travel
they offer customised travel itineraries and packages
of many places including Oman
The link to their website is in the description
So this is a banana  and a palm tree plantation
You can see were walking on the irrigation system
so we dont wanna step on anything
There are no dates on any of these trees
but when they are they look like this
They grow in bunches
There can be more than a thousand dates in a bunch
Omans population is less than 5 million
But there are more than 7 million date palm trees
Can you imagine that
there are more date trees  than people in this country?
There was a small hill here
The view from here is simply amazing
You can see the date palm tree  plantation spread over this area
And behind it you can see  some interesting historical civilisations
We finished checking into the second hotel now
and as soon as we entered the room
look at what we found
A huge YouTube cake
Welcome to Al Bustan Palace
Thats the name of this hotel
And they have my latest photo on  top of this YouTube cake
Probably edible
And the Play Button Subscribe
wait a second Dislike?
No no no lets remove the Dislike
Dislike also? We dont need it here
These cakes look really interesting
They look really good
But unfortunately its not  possible to eat so much sugar
its just too much
If you take an hourlong speedboat ride from Muscat
you will reach Al Daymaniyat Island
It is a protected nature reserve
and a wonderful site for ecotourism
So were on the beautiful island now
Were the only ones on this island
The only ones? Look theres no one else around here
Were about to go snorkelling Yeah
Theres a small problem
Someone one of us I wont say who
forgot their swimming pants
So they have to go in undie
Underwater youll find more than  100 species of corals
more than 280 species of fish
but if the thing this place is most famous for
are the turtles
The endangered species of green turtles
often come here to nest
and while snorkelling
these turtles can get very close to you
In this video you can see
that they arent scared of humans
Now were at a special museum in Oman
The building is so unique that
Im in a sciencefiction movie
Not in 2024 but in 2124
It looks so crazy
Look behind you
This building feels like its AIgenerated
Its so perfect
Everything looks so proper
you wont even find a single  dust particle on this floor
This is the biggest museum in Oman
Oman Across the Ages
The museum building is so huge that
there is more than 900000 m of exhibition space here
And in some galleries the ceiling is so high
some are more than 20m high
The huntergatherers who lived in Oman 6000 years ago
lived in such huts
These are some historical  Omani sea routes over here
Look at this the screen is so big
but there are gaps between the screen
To go further into the museum
you can pass through the gaps in the screen
This museum has been designed very creatively
Theres another screen on the other side
Friends here you can clearly see
the Omani national emblem
That has two swords and a dagger
This is the passport of Omans previous Sultan
You can see it
Along with his Drivers License and ID Card
You can see the number on the ID Card
Most of the things that you saw in this vlog
were from around Muscat
But apart from this in Oman you can see deserts
the highest mountain in the Gulf
as well as the Gulfs Grand Canyon
We showed the Grand Canyon in the previous vlog

Now I am become death
the destroyer of worlds
16th July 1945
around 530 in the morning
In the desert of Americas state New Mexico
a bomb explodes
But this is not a normal bomb explosion
This was the first time
a nuclear bomb was being tested
This nuclear test was codenamed Trinity
and the project was led by
scientist J Robert Oppenheimer
Oppenheimer was shocked to see this bomb blast
He had expected the size of the explosion to be
around 03 kilotons of TNT
But in reality this blast was 50 times more dangerous
1520 kilotons of TNT
The blast released so much heat
that a steel tower evaporated
The shockwave was felt from a distance of 160 km
The mushroom cloud that erupted went up to 12 km in the sky
Upon seeing all this Oppenheimer was so shocked that
he uttered a line from the Bhagavad Gita
You might be asking how did Oppenheimer know about Bhagavad Gita?
We will talk about that later in the video
Since Christopher Nolan made a new film
So I thought this would be the right opportunity to make a video on him
What was his story?
How did he develop the nuclear bomb?
Was Oppenheimer a hero or a villain?
And how did he feel
when millions of people lost their lives because of his creation?
Julius Robert Oppenheimer
is known as the father of the atomic bomb
He was the director of the Manhattan Project
that created the first nuclear weapons
Lets start this story from his childhood
He was born in 1904
to a German Jewish family in New York City
And he was considered a child genius since childhood
He was studying highlevel physics and chemistry at the age of only 10
And he was very knowledgeable about mineralogy
About property of minerals
He was so knowledgeable that at the age of 12
he was invited to give a lecture at New Yorks Mineralogical Club
Later in 1922
when he went to Harvard to study
he completed his 4year degree in 3 years
He was at the top of his class
He majored in chemistry
and he was knowledgeable about many subjects
Physics philosophy literature
and even Eastern religion
But in Harvard he realized that among all these subjects
his real passion was physics
Later in 1927 at the age of 23
he did his PhD
But there was a dark side hidden behind this genius
His friends said that Oppenheimer had selfdestructive tendencies
He was a chain smoker
and was suffering through depression
One day he told his brother
I need physics more than friends
He was focused only on his studies
and remained unaware of what was happening in the world around him
Until the early 1930s
when Adolf Hitler rose in Germany
He gradually became more politically aware
Because of Hitlers tyranny
many German scientists were fleeing from Germany to America
There were many big names on this list
Like Albert Einstein
John von Neumann
who pioneered modern computers
Leo Szilard
who will play an important role in our story
Hans Bethe
who discovered fusion in stars
Edward Teller
who is called the father of the hydrogen bomb
And Enrico Fermi
who will play another important role in our story
All these scientists mainly were GermanJewish
and because Oppenheimer himself came from a GermanJewish family
when he started paying attention to the atrocities on Jews
his interest in politics started developing
This is his quote from 1936
I started to understand how deeply political  and economic events affect peoples lives
I felt the need to participate in this community
Influenced by the leftwing ideology
he went to many political meetings
And donated money to many labour unions and striking farm workers
In September 1939
Hitler invaded Poland
which was the beginning of World War 2
As I explained in my video on World War 2
America was not interested
in getting involved in this war
But still America was preparing for the worst
Actually what happened was that
a month before the war started
in August 1939
Albert Einstein and Leo Szilard wrote a letter
to American President Franklin D Roosevelt
In this letter they warned the American President
that Hitler is working on nuclear weapons
And that he may be successful in making this extremely powerful bomb
Thats why America should be prepared
As soon as he read this letter the American President
set up an advisory committee on uranium
Taking immediately action
A team of scientists and military officials was formed
Their job was to research the potential of uranium
Can uranium be made into a weapon?
After the findings of this committee
the American government started funding Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard
For researching how nuclear chain reactions work
And how to separate the isotopes of uranium
The thing is that the naturally found uranium on earth
is the uranium238 isotope
Less than 1 of the uranium is actually a U235 isotope
And only this U235 isotope
could be used to make the bomb
The first challenge for these scientists
was to find a way to make uranium235
using the uranium238
But the scientists working on this project
were told not to tell Albert Einstein anything
Because the American government was afraid
that Albert Einsteins ideology was very leftwing
It could have been a potential security risk
As you know Albert Einstein was one of those people
who used to sleep for 10 hours a night
He knew the importance of sleep
and he used to take strategic naps in the day
Compare this to todays social media motivational gurus
who tell you that you should not waste time sleeping
They tell fraud stories of how the successful people
sleep only for 56 hours a night
All lies
The truth is that regular and sufficient sleep
is very important for every human being
Apart from a few exceptions
every human being needs to sleep for 79 hours
to be at the top of their health
Especially if you want to maximize your productivity and happiness

Oppenheimer was doing his independent research
on nuclear fission with Edward Teller and other scientists
December 1940
Apart from the Uranium235 isotope
another radioactive element was discovered
which scientists believe
could also be used to make nuclear weapons
The name of this element was Plutonium
On 11th October 1941
American President sends a message to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill
saying that both countries should collaborate
for atomic development
Not even 2 months later
that on 7th December 1941
Japan attacked Pearl Harbor
and America officially entered World War 2
A state of war
has existed between
the United States and the Japanese Empire
American President Roosevelt announced that
America will become a part of the Allied powers
who were fighting against Germany and Japan
If you want to know the whole story of World War 2
I have made two videos on it
Part 1 and part 2
and detailed everything from start to end
If you havent seen it I will put the link in the description
you can watch them after this video
But at this point in time it becomes clear that
the scientific mission of developing nuclear weapons
had turned into a military mission
America spent 22 billion
on this one project
Taking inflation into account it is equivalent to 24 billion today
Almost 2 trillion Indian rupees
The American military had an engineering wing
the Army Corps of Engineers
It made ports and airfields for the army
Its involvement was approved by President Roosevelt
in June 1942
Now the office of the North Atlantic Division was in Manhattan New York City
And when they got the responsibility to make nuclear weapons
they made their headquarters in the same building on the 18th floor
These headquarters were named Manhattan Engineer District
and from this point in time
the Manhattan Project officially started
The date was 13th August 1942
Next month on 17th September
Colonel Leslie Richard Groves
was appointed as the head of the project
And he made the decision to
appoint Oppenheimer as the leader of the design of the atomic bomb
A secret location was decided to keep this project under cover
Oak Ridge Tennessee
This city is also called the Secret City
because an entire city was built here
only for this project
Thousands of scientists researchers and workers
were moved to this city
and they had only one task
Creating Uranium235 from Uranium238
I will not go into the details of the science of nuclear fission
because I explained it in the video on Chernobyl
You can watch that video if you want to understand it in detail
The point is that Uranium238
is not very fissionable
It cannot undergo a chain reaction
to make a bomb
It was very important to extract Uranium235
Only Uranium235 can undergo a chain reaction
which is why it was required
The plan was to try out 4 different methods
to make U235 from U238
Gaseous diffusion
electromagnetic separation
and liquid thermal diffusion
After testing these 4 different technologies
2 technologies proved to be successful to some extent
Electromagnetic separation and gaseous diffusion
In electromagnetic separation
a large magnet is used to separate U235 from U238
In gaseous diffusion
Uraniumhexafluoride gas
is passed through a porous membrane
in which the light molecules of U235
pass successfully
But since the U238 molecules are heavier
and they get filtered out
Apart from this at a different location in Washington
scientists were at work producing Plutonium as well
Plutonium is also produced from Uranium 238
When an isotope of hydrogen
is bombarded with Uranium 238
then plutonium is produced
Later it was found that plutonium
is more radioactive and more fissionable
as compared to Uranium 235
Apart from these two locations
they were looking for a third location
For Project Y
A location where the actual work of
designing and making these bombs would take place
General Groves wanted a remote location for this
So that the project could remain a secret
Oppenheimer knew exactly such a location
It is a place where Oppenheimer spent his summers happily
Surrounded by mountains and beautiful landscapes
the Pecos Valley in New Mexico
After setting up all these locations
there was only one obvious thing left to do
To practically test out a chain reaction
Everything was theoretical till now
So they needed proof on whether
the whole concept of the atomic bomb
was feasible or not
2nd December 1942
Scientist Enrico Fermi conducted the first successful practical experiment
In a squash court of the University of Chicago
he ran a chain reaction
which helps light up a bulb
The clicketyclack of their instruments
proved they had achieved
the first humanmade nuclear chain reaction
By this point General Groves
was impressed with Oppenheimers ability
He wanted to appoint him as the director of Project Y
But some senior members of the military
doubted Oppenheimer
The same way that they doubted Albert Einstein
Many friends of Oppenheimer
his wife and in fact his brother
were all hardcore communists
He was influenced by the leftwing ideology himself
America was afraid that this communist ideology
could go against their country
But despite these concerns
General Groves personally supported Oppenheimer
and said that
this project could not happen without Oppenheimer
And that he was essential for this project
And because of this on 20th July 1943
Oppenheimer was made the lead of this project
To make an atom bomb
Oppenheimers expertise was required
in the calculation of critical mass
Critical mass is basically a minimum amount of mass
of Uranium235 or Plutonium
which is needed to have a chain reaction
to sustain a chain reaction
The minimum amount of radioactive elements that would be needed
to carry out a chain reaction and a bomb blast
It seems easy today
but there were many unknown factors at that time
We hardly knew anything about the properties of Uranium235
Plutonium239 was actually discovered in 1940
And by the end of 1943
only 2 milligrams of plutonium could be produced
Thats why America was developing two atom bombs
The first bomb was based on Uranium235
named Little Boy
The mechanism of this bomb was basically
a guntype design
Two masses of Uranium235 were taken
which were subcritical
Less than the critical value
And they were combined rapidly with each other
With this combination the critical mass was reached
and a fission chain reaction follows
resulting in an explosion
The second bomb was the plutonium bomb
which was using plutonium239
and its name was Fat Man
It was more difficult to design
Here it could not be designed as a gun
because if the masses of two plutonium were combined
it would react very quickly
and the fission reaction would end before the critical mass could be reached
A Plutonium gunbomb would melt not explode
Here scientists created a different design for the plutonium bomb
The mass of plutonium was to be placed under high pressure and density
in a spherical structure
A subcritical mass of plutonium was placed inside a hollow sphere
And outside the sphere explosives were used
to create an implosion in the mass of plutonium
When the explosives outside exploded
the plutonium would be under high pressure
and it would reach the critical mass
This concept was called the implosion method
Scientists already knew about the gun method
but this was the first time that the implosion method was theoretically mentioned
Oppenheimer believed that it was necessary to test it out
before actually putting it in the bomb
General Groves said that
they cant test such things because
they had produced only a small amount of plutonium
But Oppenheimer was adamant that
the test was necessary
So General Groves had to finally agree
And then friends the Trinity Test was conducted
I talked about this at the beginning of the video
In the desert of New Mexico
a test nuclear bomb was dropped
This test bomb was called Gadget
It contained 13 pounds of plutonium
Scientists hung Gadget 100 ft in the air using a steel tower
And on 16th July 1945
at 530 am
this bomb was detonated
As I told you
this bomb was much more powerful than Oppenheimer expected
The steel tower completely evaporated
After the bomb blast a mildly radioactive greencoloured glass was formed
which was named Trinitite
It was after seeing this blast
that Oppenheimer uttered some lines of the Bhagavad Gita
I suppose we all thought that
one way or another
Actually Oppenheimer was a Sanskrit scholar
and he had studied the entire Bhagavad Gita
in its original form
He describes the Bhagavad Gita as one of the most influential books of his life
Less than a month after the Trinity test
on 6th August 1945
the Little Boy bomb was dropped on Hiroshima
If that wasnt enough
then three days later this plutonium Fat Man bomb
was dropped on Nagasaki too
What was the effect of dropping these atomic bombs?
I have discussed this in detail in the Hiroshima and Nagasaki video
Albert Einsteins first reaction
upon hearing this news was
Woe is me
A melancholy statement
It is believed that Albert Einstein also said this
Mankind invented the atomic bomb
but no mouse would ever construct a mousetrap
Oppenheimer expressed happiness after the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima
He wished that this bomb
could be used against Nazi Germany and Hitler
But when the bomb was dropped on Nagasaki
Oppenheimer was shocked
On 17th August he went to Washington
to meet the Secretary of War
To handdeliver the letter he wrote
He directly said that
he wanted to ban nuclear weapons
He was very regretful
about his part in it
The technology he handed over to humas
Oppenheimer considered the first bomb dropped on Hiroshima as a necessary evil
But now he was afraid for the future
What will different countries do with this technology in the future?
In the meantime in April 1945
American President Roosevelt passed away
The next American President was Harry Truman
Two months after the bomb was dropped on Nagasaki
Oppenheimer got a chance
to meet President Truman
When meeting the President he said directly
I have blood on my hands
And President Truman was so angry after hearing this that
he started shouting at him
He told his secretary to throw Oppenheimer out of the office
and that he didnt want to see his face ever again
Oppenheimer later worked with the US Atomic Energy Commission
to stop other such nuclear attacks
He wanted to establish control over nuclear weapons
In 1949 when President Truman approached the commission
with the idea of making a hydrogen bomb
Oppenheimer strongly opposed it
But this opposition was of no use
because America developed a hydrogen bomb later
and also conducted tests in 1952
Edward Teller was the scientist
who helped in making this hydrogen bomb
And he is called the Father of the Hydrogen Bomb today
Because of Oppenheimers resistance
and his leftwing ideology
his job was snatched away from him
He spent the rest of his life in the academic profession
and used to give lectures all over the world
Even though he was nominated for the Nobel Prize thrice
he could not win even once
In 1965 due to throat cancer
Oppenheimer died at the age of 62
Which was not surprising
as he was a terrible chain smoker throughout his life
Today there are 9 countries
that have nuclear weapons
India Pakistan China
the USA France the UK
Israel Russia and North Korea
But the positive thing is that in the last 80 years
no other nuclear weapon has been used
If you liked the video you can learn the whole story of Chernobyl
in this video by clicking here
You will be able to understand a little more about nuclear reactions
Recently a film called The Kerala Story was released
which is being talked about a lot
In this film it is shown how
a secret plot is underway in Kerala
to forcefully convert innocent women to Islam
and then they are being sent to ISS
According to this film and the director of this film
this has been done to approximately 32000 girls
who are now buried in the deserts of Syria and Yemen
What is the real story behind this?
How much truth is in it?
Come lets try to find out in this video
The Kerala Story
32000 girls like me
were forced to convert
and now theyre buried in the deserts of Syria and Yemen
About 100 years ago
Adolf Hitler the dictator of Germany wrote a book
called Mein Kampf
In this book he talked about
a propaganda technique called Big Lie
Hitler said that to manipulate people you need to lie so outrageously to
make people think that no one can make up such an outrageous lie
To make them think that there must be some truth in it
When an outrageous lie is told with so much confidence
some people believe it to be true
People think that no one can lie so much
Additionally another propaganda technique as told by
Hitlers propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels
Goebbels said that repetition is also very important here
Keep repeating this big lie again and again
Repeat this big lie so many times that
people get to hear the same lie from 4 different sources
By doing this people become more convinced
A third technique is said to be the HalfTruth
Sometimes add in some element of truth in your speeches
Because nowadays some people can easily identify big liars
When someone says that no one can lie so outrageously all the time
someone might counter that by showing that the speaker is a total fraud
Someone who mightve been an Olympic champion
had lying been an Olympic sport
For those who are not convinced by the big lies
half truth is supposed to convince them
Why am I telling you all these propaganda techniques?
Because in this video youll see
how these 3 techniques have been used to mislead people
The Kerala Story films director Sudipto Sen was asked
which true incidents inspired this film
He said many things here
First he said that in 2010
Keralas former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy
he gave a statement in Keralas Assembly
You can Google this statement
and you will see a report from India Today
2500 women Islam Kerala Oommen Chandy
seems right
Then it was said that another former Chief Minister of Kerala
VS Achuthanandan had once said that
Kerala is going to become an Islamic state in the next 20 years
If you search this on Google
and you see this video on YouTube or Twitter
You think oh this is also right
Then in the teaser of the film it is shown that
a girl says that she is Fatima
and that she is imprisoned in Afghanistans jail
You search this on Google
and you see a news article from The Hindu
Fatima Afghanistans jail Islamic State
Was that right too?
Friends these were some good examples
of halftruth
Most people skim through the headlines
and dont go into detail
Lets talk about the first article
This article was published in India Today in 2012
informed the state legislature
that between 2006 to 2012
2667 women converted to Islam
Approximately 2500 women in 6 years
But the thing to note is
did he ever use the term forced conversions?
He said that they will not allow any forced conversions in their state
and neither will they tolerate hate campaigns against Muslims
with accusations of Love Jihad
Was it mentioned anywhere
that these converted women were joining ISS?
Lets see the second citation
The interview of the former Chief Minister VS Achuthanandan
He was the Chief Minister of Kerala from 2006 to 2011
The video that is being circulated from back then
was uploaded by Sunshine Pictures
The same company which made this film
they messed with the English subtitles
The words that are being said by him
and the subtitles that appear here are not the same
Secondly here VS Achuthanandan
was strongly criticizing PFI saying that
the PFI was trying to influence the youth of other religions
by paying them to marry Muslim women
ISS is not mentioned here either
Secondly its been 13 years since this statement
Kerala as a state is still as safe and secular
as it was 13 years ago
Now lets see the next article from June 2021
This article talks about 4 women from Kerala
who went to Afghanistan with their husbands
to join the Islamic State of Khorasan Province
between 2016 and 2018
Their husbands were killed in various attacks
Their names are Nimisha alias Fathima Isa
Sonia Sebastian alias Ayisha
Merrin Jacob alias Mariyam
and Reffeala
If you look at NIAs list from 2016
of the 20 most wanted Indians in Islamic State
you will see the names of these 4 women here
Additionally there are 2 more women
Ajmala and Shamasia
Their husbands were cousins
You can see the photos of the husbands of these 6 women here
3 of these 6 women were already Muslims
2 converted to Islam from Christianity
And 1 converted to Islam from Hinduism
So only one of these women was originally Hindu
Her name was Nimisha Nair
Was Nimisha Nair trapped by a Muslim man in a case of love jihad?
To find out the answer lets see
who is Nimishas husband
Eeza is a man who converted to Islam from Christianity
His old name was Bexon Vincent
Bexons brother Bestin
also converted to Islam from Christianity
And he too was the husband of one of these 4 women
So both the brothers and their wives
were all converts and brainwashed
Recently the Indian government
denied these four women permission to get back to India
You can watch the video interviews of three of these women
of Nimisha Sonia Sebastian and Reffeala
on YouTube online
on the YouTube channel StratNews Global
They gave an interview in 2020
And there you can see how these women looked
how they talked and their behaviour
When there was a caliphate
when I was there
I was happy there
I can never say that
Khilafa caliphate was wrong
That it was wrong
I cant say that because
I had a comfortable life here
Anyone watching this video can see
how brainwashed and radicalized these women still are
But the main character of the film The Kerala Story
constantly tries to evoke sympathy
The helplessness and innocence shown in the film
theres perhaps not even a glimpse of it in the videos of real life
I want to ask you
will you have sympathy for these real life women?
Or will you call them brainwashed idiots?
Would you want them to remain in Afghanistans jail
or would you want the Indian government to bring them back to India
only to put them in Indian jail?
I leave this question to you
Comment below with your opinion
Strategic News Global Report tells us that
the 20 people mentioned in the 2016 NIA chargesheet
were very interconnected with each other
when it comes to radicalization
17 of them came from a single district
From Kasaragod district in Kerala
A 2020 report from the Hindustan Times stated that
some more people joined later
so in total there were 22 people from Kasaragod
This article in India Today from 2016 states that
the trend shows that not only single youths are joining ISS
but the whole family
including husband wife and even the children
have gone and joined ISS
It is also mentioned in the article that
most of the ISS recruits before this
were from Maharashtra Karnataka and Telangana
Not from Kerala
But this Strat News Global Report goes on to say that
by 2018 60 Indians had travelled to Afghanistan
Of which 26 were males
13 women and 21 children
After knowing all of this it can be clearly said that
there is definitely a problem here
People are being radicalized brainwashed
to join ISS
New modes of communication have opened up through the internet
In 2019 Union Minister of State for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy said that
Indian investigators have found that
ISS is using the dark web and encrypted platforms
to radicalize people and recruit t3rrrists
But the question here is
how big is this problem?
The film said that this has already happened to 32000 women in Kerala
But lets see the statistics
Vladimir Voronkov
the Undersecretary General of the United Nations Office of Counter Terrrism
He said that from 110 countries
nearly 40000 foreign t3rrrist fighters
went to Syria and Iraq to join the conflict
40000 individuals from 110 countries
Another estimate was given by the 2018 study by
the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization of Kings College London
41490 people from 80 different countries
are affiliated with ISS
79 of them are men
On the basis of these two reports
we can arrive at an estimate
there are around 4000042000 foreign t3rrrists
who have gone to join ISS from all over the world
So how many of them are from India?
The Bureau of CounterTerrrism of the US
published country reports in 2020
It stated that by September 2020
the NIA had investigated 34 cases of t3rrrism
and arrested 160 people related to ISS in India
Lets see another source for doublechecking
Observer Research Foundation published a paper in October 2019
They said that the number of proISS cases in India
between 2014 and 2018 was around 180200
This estimate of 200 people
doesnt include only those people
who actually left India to join ISS
It also includes those people who spread ISS propaganda
on the internet in India
Lets look at a third source
In 2019 the Indian Home Ministry said that
this number was at 155
The next question is that
since these are the cases from all over India
How many cases are there in Kerala?
Out of the total 180200 cases
40 cases are said to be from Kerala
200 from India and 40 from Kerala
But this number doesnt tell us how many people actually went to join ISS
Because the number includes all people affiliated with ISS
and people who spread propaganda
How many people actually left India to join ISS?
US Department of State report revealed that
there were around 66 known Indianorigin fighters
who were affiliated with ISS
as of November 2020
only 66
2018s Strat News global report also gave a figure close to 60
so both numbers are quite close
Out of these 60
how many were women?
Approximately 13 women
How many women were from Kerala?
Only 6 women were from Kerala
Out of these 6 how many women
were converted to Islam from other religions?
3 women
Out of these 3 2 were Christians
and only 1 was a Hindu
The events shown in the film
happened to 3 women in real life
but not in the manner
shown in the film
However the film claims that
this happened to 32000 women
This is the Big Lie friends
This lie is so big that
if a common man hears it
he will think that even if not 32000
there must still be some truth in it
This must have happened to a few 1000 women
If not thousands
then it must have happened to hundreds of women
No! Only 3 women
Now some of you might say
whether its 32000 or 3 what difference does it make?
The story remains the same
Whats the problem?
There are many problems
First if instead of 32000 the meagre number of 3 was used
then the whole concept of the film fails
Saying that there is a secret love jihad conspiracy going on here
to forcibly convert girls and send them to ISS
and as a result of this conspiracy
only 3 women suffered
then it means that these are individual cases
There is no conspiracy here
Second to generalize and exaggerate things to this level
is simply stupid
If this was done with any other incident
you will say that it is utter nonsense
Let me use an example
Over the last few months
there were 3 such cases of
an Indian citizen urinating on a copassenger in an airplane
Now imagine a country like America or Japan
makes a film called The India Story
and the film shows how Indians
always urinate on copassengers in airplanes
32000 such incidents too place
where Indians have urinated on someone
How will you feel about it?
You will say that it is utter nonsense
That they are trying to defame the country
But if on the other hand the filmmaker says
that 32000 was an exaggerated number
but it did happen thrice
so making the film was justified
What would be your response in that case?
Does it make any sense?
Similarly the entire state of Kerala is being defamed for 3 individual cases
When the director of the film was asked about it
about the source of the 32000 number
he evaded the questions
While talking to Alt News he said that
only after the release of the film would he share his data
based on which he used the number 32000
He told The Quint that
asking such questions doesnt make any difference
It is very cliched
When the film was screened in JNU
he said that the 32000 number was an arbitrary number
And when the matter reached the court
he removed 32000 from the description of the film
replacing it with 3
The truth is that
the story of these three women was worth telling
Had this story been told
without lies and propaganda
Every person who is brainwashed
and recruited in ISS is a potential threat
But how big is this problem in India?
If you compare it with other countries
you will find it shocking
In India as I told you this number is around 66
the victims of ISS propaganda
According to the 2016 data
in the former Soviet republics there were 7000 such people
2500 people from Russia
1700 people in France
760 people in Germany
The number of victims in the UK was also around 700
The population of all these countries is much less than India
But the number of people who fell victim to ISS
is much higher in these countries
And here it is also worth noting that
India has the 3rd largest Muslim population in the world
So compared to countries like France Germany and UK
more Muslims live in India
But still fewer ISS recruits are seen in India
If you look at the ratio here
ISS recruits per million people
India has a ratio of 05 per million
It is 36 times more in France
at 18 per million
Belgium has a ratio of 40 per million
and in Jordan it is 315 per million
Was this mentioned in the film even once?
Some people truly enjoy
watching a state of their country being defamed
based on lies
The ORF report held that
academics and experts often ask
why did so few Muslims from India join ISS?
There are many factors for this
First the superb response of the Indian agencies
Very few of you may know about Operation Pigeon
Our agencies like NIA and IB
carried out a mission
in which they identified 350 vulnerable Malayali youth
and ran a deradicalization program
to save our youth from this extremism and radicalization
A great job by our officers
But you know whats shameful?
Our Prime Minister in his election speeches
instead of promoting good work
the PM promotes this film of lies
The film based on t3rrrist plots
The Kerala Story is nowadays
is highly talked about
This reminds me of another historic operation
by the Indian forces against ISS
An immensely risky operation
on which the film Tiger Zinda Hai was made

If Prime Minister Modi wanted
he could have told people about this inspirational story
But no he had to promote a propaganda film
The second reason as claimed by former diplomat Talmiz Ahmad
is Indias syncretic culture and tradition
The Unity in Diversity in India
Muslims live harmoniously with Hindus and Christians in India
And thats why they rejected extreme ideologies
In 2015 when it was found that
only 29 Indians had joined ISS
a report stated that ISS itself
considered Indian recruits to be inferior
ISS believed that the Islam practised in India
is a very soft version
It is a liberal version of Islam
Third many Muslim clerics have also played a positive role here
In March 2009 Darul Uloom Deoband issued a fatwa
declaring India as Dar alAman
A country where militant Jihad is prohibited
Similarly in 2015 a joint fatwa was issued
by 70000 Indian Muslim scholars
against ISS Taliban AlQaeda and other t3rrrist organizations
The real Kerala story here
is something to be proud of
Compared to the rest of the world
how few Muslims from India joined ISS
And Kerala is a living example of unity in diversity
People of different religions live together peacefully
This is the reason why Kerala is the number one state across many indicators
Number one in education
number one in healthcare
number one in human development index
But then our politicians use these fake stories to defame Kerala
In February this year
when Home Minister Amit Shah was campaigning for the elections
said in Karnataka that
Kerala is right next to Karnataka
Heavily implying on how dangerous Kerala is
Maligning Kerala is not the only propaganda in this film
Another Big Lie is Love Jihad
In the film it is shown that
there are forceful religious conversions
In 2017 the Kerala government
submitted a list of 90 cases to the NIA
to investigate whether there was a Love Jihad angle or not
NIA examined 11 of those cases
and concluded in 2018
that although PFI facilitated conversion
but not a single case was found
where a person of whatever gender was being forced to convert
If one proof is not enough look at the other
The Union Home Ministry said the same in 2020
In 2020 Minister of State for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy
told Lok Sabha in a written reply that
no case of Love Jihad has been reported
by any central agency
This conspiracy theory of Love Jihad
is a Big Lie told to you
using different angles
Politicians use it in their speeches
you get these WhatsApp forwards from WhatsApp University
talking about Love Jihad
And the propaganda news channels use Love Jihad as news
This big lie is repeated so many times that
people begin to think that there must be some truth in it
The same thing that I said in the beginning
The whole concept of Love Jihad
is not only used to defame Muslims
but the concept goes against women
Think about it
people who believe that
a woman can be easily manipulated by a man
what kind of people are they?
Are women cattle?
Doesnt a woman have a brain?
Anyone can come and say anything
and women will meekly follow around like cattle
Whether its a Hindu woman a Muslim woman
a Christian woman or a woman of any other religion
All women should come together
to tell their religious leaders to mind their own businesses
Women have brains
If a man tries to forcefully convert a woman
she can go to the police
And the law states that
if someone tries to forcefully convert another person
he will have to go to jail
But the question is
how many people are being converted in India?
Sometimes some Christian missionaries
or these Hindu priests or Muslim clerics
become a little overactive in their preaching
and the balance shifts a bit
Like this 2016 news article
where the leader of Vishwa Hindu Parishad said that
their organization has converted 750000 people
back to Hinduism in 10 years
But if these religious leaders from different religions dont interfere
and people want to convert of their own will
then you get to see a balance
Look at the April 2021 report
506 people registered that they want to change their religion
with the Kerala government
47 of these people
converted from Christianity or Islam to Hinduism
So its not like we are seeing more conversions to one religion
2021 survey by the Pew Research Center
showed the same thing
More than 30000 people were surveyed
and it was found that only 07 of people
left Hinduism and adopted other religions
And 08 of people left other religions and adopted Hinduism
We need to understand that
merely for some political power
a very dirty game is being played here
Big lies are being propagated
conspiracy theories are being developed
so that Hindus Muslims and Christians
can be provoked into fighting each other
Some political parties benefit a lot if
people are filled with hatred for people from other religions
In the beginning it was only WhatsApp forwards
then the propagandaenabling media started doing this
And now propaganda films are being made to mislead people
100 years ago this used to happen during Hitlers rule as well
Many propaganda films were made
Many such films
which distorted history of their own will
defamed Jews and
glorified German Aryans
Such big lies were propagated in those films
They were repeated to convince people
In the greed for power and money
these people are trying to break the country from inside out
They who spread so much vile hatred
should remember one thing
it is possible that they be successful
in spreading fear violence and hatred
But they need to remember that
this country has gone through a lot
Whenever any power tried to divide the country
the people of the country came together and bounced back
At last Id like to say that
If you want to watch a film on this topic
watch this Swedish TV series on Netflix The Caliphate
No one has been defamed in that film
no lies or propaganda has been spread
In fact it tells a true story
of how ISS recruited some young girls in Sweden
Its a thrilling show
And thank you very much!
Another conflict has broken out  between Israel and Palestine
At 630 AM on the morning of 7th October
While most of the Israelis were  sleeping soundly in their homes
suddenly the air raid sirens began blaring
In a short while thousands of  rockets were fired at Israeli cities
Israeli Defence Forces estimate that
2200 rockets were fired
However the group Hams claims that
5000 rockets were fired
Israel has an Iron Dome system
It is one of the best air defence systems in the world
Whenever rockets are fired on Israel
it uses the latest military technology
to intercept the rockets  and destroy them midflight
to keep the country protected
But here 5000 rockets were fired within 20 minutes
This Iron Dome system failed
Thousands of people were klled and injured  in Israel because of these attacks
This surprise attack is the biggest  in the last few decades
that has been seen in  the IsraelPalestine conflict
And it reminds us of the Yom Kippur War
Exactly 50 years ago
in October 1973
Egypt and Syria had launched  a similar surprise attack on Israel
After that a war broke out
Known as the Yom Kippur War
And this attack is no less  than a fullscale war
In addition to the rocket strikes
Hams launched a multipronged attack
from the ground sea and air
The boundary wall on the IsraelGaza border
was broken down by a bulldozer
Many Palestinians were seen  entering Israeli territory
Some on motorcycles
some using motorpowered hanggliders
to enter Israel through the air
Apart from this Hams also attacked Israel  from the sea using speedboats
Many events took place within a day
A military base on the IsraelGaza border  was also attacked
An Israeli tank was captured
Many Israeli soldiers were captured
and held hostages by the Hams group
And the Israeli villages and cities on the border
were infiltrated by armd trrrists of Hams
Many innocent civilians have been klld here
many are being held as hostages
and Israel has declared a state of war in response
The Israeli military carried out airstrikes in Gaza
In which thousands of Palestinians were klled or injured
Lets take a look at the map  to understand the context of this situation
Israel and Palestine are located in the Middle East
In the North is the country of Lebanon
In the Northeast there is Syria
In the East there is Jordan
In the South West there is Egypt
And in the West is the Mediterranean Sea
If you zoom in on both countries
the area in the middle is the country of Israel
And the territories of Palestine
are divided into two parts
One is the region of the West Bank
which is in the west of Jordan
and the other is the Gaza Strip
which is in the southwest of Israel
and borders Egypt
There are many Israeli settlements  in the Palestinian territory of the West Bank
They are under Israels control
And are considered illegal
by the United Nations and many other countries
The Palestinian territories in the West Bank
are administered by Palestinian Authorities
under the control of Fatah
A political party
On the other hand the Gaza Strip
is controlled independently by Hams
There has been a separate conflict  between Fatah and Hams historically
Hams is an extremist Palestinian organisation
which is considered a trrrist organisation  by most countries
Canada the European Union Israel
Japan Australia the USA and the UK
designate Hams as a trrrist organisation
On the other hand it is not considered a trrrist organisation by
Brazil China Egypt
Iran Norway Qatar
Russia Syria and Turkey
There are also some countries  that consider only Hams military wing
as a trrrist organisation
Like New Zealand and Paraguay
This is geopolitically relevant because
you will see how differently these countries  are reacting to the current situation
If we look at the map of the current conflict
we can see that
the Gaza Strip is shown in red colour
And the extent to which Israeli territory has  been infiltrated by the Palestinian militnts
is shown in blue colour
Hams military commander Mohammad AlDeif
has named this attack  Operation AlAqsa Flood
And said that Hams is doing this because
Israel has committed atrocities on the Palestinians
And that this is specifically a response
of what happened in Al Aqsa mosque
If you want to know about the issue regarding Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem
I talked about it in this video 2 years ago

For the Indian nationals present in Israel
the Indian embassy in Israel has issued an advisory
that you can see on the screen
In case of an emergency
they can call this number
or can send an email to this id
Israel launched its own attack in response
which was named Operation Iron Swords
Israeli Defense Forces  also known as IDF in short
have deployed their Navy Air Force and Ground Forces
Along with that they launched drone strikes in Gaza
Israels Energy Minister signed an order
to cut the electricity supply in Gaza
To a large extent electricity was  supplied through Israel to Gaza
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said at a television address
Citizens of Israel we are at war
He said that the enmy will have to  pay an unprecedented price
The defence minister stated that
Hams has made a huge mistake
and Israel will win this war
A big talking point in this conflict is how
Mossad the worldfamous Israeli intelligence agency
failed to intercept this attack
It is said that Mossad
is one of the most powerful intelligence agencies
They have informants even in  the Palestinian military groups
They are in Lebanon Syria
and in different parts of the world
In the past it has been seen that Mossad agents
have carried out precise timed asasinations
of major military leaders
Sometimes by placing GPS trackers on vehicles
sometimes by using drone strikes
or sometimes by using mobile phones
If you want to know more about Mossad

And now coming back to Mossad
despite being such a powerful agency
how did they not know that
thousands of rockets were being stockpiled in Gaza?
The fencing on the GazaIsrael border
has cameras ground motion sensors
and regular army patrols are carried out there
Why did these smart barriers fail?
Domestically the Israeli government  is facing a lot of criticism
The former head of the Israeli Navy
told the Israeli TV channel Channel 12 that
this is a huge failure on the part of the government
The entire country is asking
about the whereabouts of IDF police and security
He told the BBC that a major  investigation has already begun
regarding this intelligence failure
Look at this article from The Times of Israel
According to it Egypts intelligence officials
had warned Israel repeatedly that
something major was about to happen
And allegedly those warnings were ignored
On the other hand talking about international reactions
American President Joe Biden
condemned this attack and
said that he shows rocksolid and unwavering support
in favour of Israel
The foreign policy chief of the European Union
also said that he strongly condemns this attack
and says that according to international law
Israel has the right to defend itself
They said that Israeli hostages  should be released immediately
Iran which has been one  of the main supporters of Hams
their foreign ministry said that
the attack by Hams was an act of  selfdefence by the Palestinians
The foreign ministry of the neighbouring country Egypt said that
it is talking to Saudi Arabia and Jordan
in an attempt to diffuse the IsraeliPalestinian tensions
The Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas
told to the official news agency WAFA that
the Palestinians have the right to protect themselves  against the trrr of the settlers and foreign troops
As I said
he is from the Fatah party
which governs the West Bank
And historically there have been  conflicts between Fatah and Hams
2 years ago I made a detailed  video on the IsraelPalestine conflict
in which I explained their long history
In it I talked about how
Jews were persecuted in Europe for centuries
and to save their lives they migrated to Palestine
and now Palestinians have been reduced  to refugees in their own country
So Palestines cause obviously deserves support
but not by supporting trrrists
This has been the stance of  our Indian government historically
India has always supported the  Palestinian cause of selfdetermination
under various Prime Ministers
be it Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
Rajiv Gandhi Atal Bihari Vajpayee
Manmohan Singh or Prime Minister Modi
But the situation in the MiddleEast is clear
the land which is occupied by Israel
has to be vacated
Prime Minister Modi has actually  been the first Indian Prime Minister
to visit Palestine
Now the statement from PM Modi
has expressed shock
at the trrrist attacks
and he expressed solidarity with Israel
and Israels innocent victims and their families
And this is not surprising because
Hams actions here
is nothing but trrrism
Many disturbing videos have come up
where Hams trrrists have treated  women and civilians in a way that
cannot even be described in this video
It is a very shameful that
some people see them as freedom fighters
It is true that there has been injustice  against the common people in Palestine
but klling the common people in Israel
such trrrism can never be justified
Id like to repeat what I said in the previous video
Hams is a designated trrrist organisation
And Israel is a powerful country
with a proper democratic government
This is why Israel should use its powers responsibly
Some commnal bigts are very offended by such statements
On one hand there are people who want  complete eradcation of Palestine
They celebrate the attacks on Palestine
Saying that none of them should survve
Without thinking about the common Palestinians
and what they go through
On the other hand there are commnal  people celebrating Hams trrrists
They are happy to see Israel being attacked
They want Israel to be destryed
And that Israel should not exit as a country
When you come across such  comments on social media
remember that you are a human being
not a vampire thirsty for blood
Warmongering is very easy  when you are sitting far away
if you were in the midst of this war
think about what the ordinary Israeli and  Palestinian families are going through
For life to come to a halt
And to live in fear
that a rocket might hit your building at any moment
Israel is also trying to show that
they are carrying out their counteroffensive responsibly
Recently there was an airstrike on  a 14storey building in Palestine
But before the airstrike Israel  had issued a 10minute warning
so that the people living in  the building should evacuate it
before the bmb could hit it
Such warnings have been given before
like the warning given to Fatima Bashirs family
before the Israeli airstrike in May this year
Or in August 2022 a 15minute  warning was given to Gazans
before an Israeli airstrike
Although Israel claims this
but the truth is that in Israeli airstrikes
many Palestinian civilians have been klled
We hope that
there can be longlasting peace  between these two countries
But looking at the current situation it seems that
this war is going to continue for a long time
I would suggest that you  understand the historical context
of the conflict between Israel and Palestine
What is the real reason behind it?
I have explained it in detail in this video
You can click to watch it
On 11th April 1970
a rocket launched for the Apollo 13 mission  from Kennedy Space Center in America
Three astronauts were on it
But the interesting thing was that
not even a year had passed since the day
when Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon for the first time
This was already the third NASA mission
Seeing the success of the last two missions
the astronauts in this rocket were very confident about their mission
and their dream
Their dream was to set foot on the moon
But at that time they were unaware that
their dream would never come true
In April 1970
when their spacecraft was about 330000 km away from the Earth
they heard a loud bang suddenly
A huge bang that shook the entire spacecraft
Within a few seconds the warning lights and alarms start going on
It was found that one of the oxygen tanks had burst
And the other oxygen tank was leaking rapidly
Okay Houston weve had a problem here
This is Houston say again please
Houston we have a problem
The mission control on the ground couldnt believe it
They believed that the instruments were malfunctioning
But the astronauts in the spacecraft could see through the window
that the air was leaking
On the other hand they see that because of the blast
the spacecraft had shifted from its path so much that
it was going kilometres away from the Earth every second
Within a few hours the astronauts in Apollo 13
were so far away from the Earth that
it became a new record
To date no human has gone so far from the Earth
as these three astronauts did
during the Apollo 13 mission
Forget landing on the moon
the question back then was
whether they could return to Earth alive
This is the distressing story of Apollo 13
Carbon dioxide levels in the module are rising
The crew were beginning to suffer
It was a dire state
It was a really really emergency situation
In 1961 American President John F Kennedy
promised the world that
before the end of the decade
he would have humans on the moon
achieving the goal
before this decade is out
This promise should be seen in the context of the Cold War
At that time America and the Soviet Union were engaged in a race
A space race
Who will be the leader in the field of technology?
In 1969
both Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions were successful
Astronauts did not only step on the moon
but also safely returned to Earth
Kennedys promise was fulfilled
But it had a side effect
right after it the peoples and governments interest
in spending money on space
decreased drastically
Its obvious that people were excited
to see a man step on the moon for the first time
But people cannot be so excited for the second third and fourth time
The interest in the moon is fading fast
People believed that Apollo 13
would just be another routine flight
For this reason the American government cut NASAs budget
And many future missions that were planned for the new few years
like Apollo 20 were cancelled
Thats why the Apollo 13 mission
came at a crucial time in the history of space travel
NASA had to prove to the American government that
it was still worth spending money on space
Thats why the primary mission objective of Apollo 13 was
not only to inspect and survey the moons soil
but to also develop the human capability
to work in the moons environment
The main mission objective of Apollo 13
is scientific exploration of the moon
We hope to find out a lot about the origin of the moon
and from that the origin of our own planet Earth
The design of Apollo 13s spacecraft
was similar to that of the previous space missions
Mainly there were four main components
Command module service module
lunar module and launch escape system
The spacecraft was launched on a Saturn V rocket
All three astronauts were seated in the command module
which was the main part of the spacecraft
But it was a small part
The command module is just this cone shape
which is only 11 feet long
and has a diameter of 13 feet
All the instrument panels navigation gear
radios life support system
and small engines were all in this command module
The second most important part was the service module
which had most of the oxygen for the astronauts
It had some more engines too
and fuel cells to generate electricity
The command and service module is often
collectively called the command and service module
or CSM in short form
They are connected during the entire mission
until the astronauts return to Earth
And only during the reentry to Earth
are they separated from each other
The third part was the lunar module
which was actually supposed to land on the moon
And once the work on moon was over
it was supposed to get attached to the CSM module once again
The fourth part the Launch Escape System
was not so important for the mission
Its only task was to protect the astronauts from an accident during the launch
It works like this
If theres an accident during the rocket launch
and the rocket catches fire
it safely ejects the astronauts
and takes them away from the accident
You can see in this video
where this abort system was being tested
But if everything goes well in the launch
then the LES is not needed
and it is ejected and thrown away
since Apollo 13 launched safely and successfully
the LES was not needed
3 astronauts were on the spacecraft
Commander Jim Lovell
the pilot of the Lunar Module Fred Haise
and the third pilot of the Command Module Jack Swigert
Coincidentally according to the original plan
none of these three were chosen for this mission
Originally three different astronauts were chosen for this mission
But they all had different problems because of which
they were not able to participate in this mission
For this reason the crew of these three astronauts takes off from the Earth
To see this rocket launch
there were around 200000 spectators on the ground
This was a small number
compared to the Apollo 11 liftoff the previous year
That had 7 million spectators for the rocket launch
NASA again realized
how quickly people lost their interest in space exploration
But if we talk about the mission
this spacecraft took off smoothly towards its destination
It was supposed to take 3 days for them  to reach the Fra Mauro crater of the moon
This is a big hole on the moons surface
A crater
Which is believed to contain a lot of information
not only about the moon but also about the Earth
The biggest problem during the first 2 days of the flight was when
astronaut Jack Swigert realized that
he had forgotten to file his income tax return
He asked the mission control on Earth
whether he could get an extension
He got a goodhumoured reply that
that he could get a 60day extension
This conversation proves that
everything was going right
During the first two days there were no problems in the mission
At 46 hours 43 minutes of the mission
the capsule communicator on duty at that time said that
the spacecraft was in a good shape
and that they were bored sitting there
This is Apollo Control at 46 hours 43 minutes
Spacecraft is in real good shape as far as were concerned Jim
Were bored to tears down here
Things were going so smoothly that
people were getting bored
By the way you will feel very strange to hear this
but intentionally giving yourself time to get bored
is a good habit in my opinion
I believe that if you want to maximize your productivity and creativity
then you have to leave sometime free during the day
A timewhen you are literally doing nothing
just getting bored
This is very important to relax the mind
especially in todays world
If a person gets bored for 5 seconds
he starts scrolling through his phone
This is the big secret
as to how I can manage my time so efficiently
and consistently manage to give you so many videos
And that too while continuously travelling
I have shared many more such secrets and practical tips
in my time management course
A course that gives you stepbystep solutions
on how you can take out more time for things in your life
and maximize your productivity and creativity

The third day of the mission
13th April
the crew is told that
they have to do some tests on the lunar module
they have to do a broadcast for the television
Where they will use the cameras
to show the interiors of the command module and service module to the world
Now the audiences interest in this was so low that
no television network showed this broadcast at that time
Commander Lovells wife
went to the VIP section of the mission control to watch this broadcast
About 6 and a half minutes after the end of the TV broadcast
the flight controllers on the ground
asked astronaut Swigert
to check the oxygen level
There was nothing unusual in this
It was just a routine check of the oxygen tanks in the service module
And while this check was being done
suddenly a huge explosion occurred
Many warning lights and alarms went off
As I told you at the beginning of the video
the astronauts in the spacecraft were largely in shock
Commander Lovell contacted Mission Control and said
Houston weve have had a problem
It turned out that one tank of oxygen was completely empty
and the oxygen level in the other tank was going down rapidly
Mission Control on the ground first thought that
the instruments must be showing the wrong data
but that was the truth
Everyone needed to take action urgently
if they wanted to save the lives of these astronauts
The TV channels that had called this mission boring
and were not showing it on the news
made this the news headlines suddenly
Apollo 13 to the moon
is in serious jeopardy this morning
And it is not going to make a moon landing
The oxygen tanks in the spacecraft
were sphereshaped
In these oxygen was stored in liquid form
There was a heater at the center
which converted the liquid oxygen into gas
On Apollo 13 there were two such tanks in the service module
The tank number 2
was originally installed in Apollo 10
but was removed from there for modification
And a minor accident happened with it
It accidentally fell down during repair
and was damaged
The tube inside it was damaged
but no one saw it during the inspection
While testing it
people noticed that the tank
would not be completely empty
To get rid of the remaining oxygen
heaters were used to boil it completely
Later it was found that the thermometer inside it
could show a maximum temperature of 30C
But when the heater was used to heat the oxygen in the tank
the temperature would reach as high as 538C
No one noticed this extreme heating
because it did not register in the thermometer
Due to this extreme heating
the insulation of the electrical wires in the tank were damaged
Before the mission NASAs managers and engineers
had approved the tank after a thorough investigation
but they were unable to see the internal damage
And because of this
during the routine check of the tank on the third day
due to those electric wires
there was a spark and the tank explodes
It was only by chance that the tank was attached to the exterior of the spacecraft
Had it been attached inside the spacecraft and exploded there
then all the astronauts would have been k!lled instantly
But because it was on the outside
the explosion occurred outside
And only a 13foot panel was damaged in the service module
What else was damaged in the spacecraft?
The astronauts were not so sure
Now everyone had to make an important decision
Which way could they take to return to Earth?
The fastest way to return to Earth was to
rotate the spacecraft
But to do this
the main engine of the service module had to be started
The main engine was located near the blast in the CSM module
No one knew whether the engine was damaged or not
The second way to return to Earth was to
go towards the moon
and circle around the moon
to return to the Earth
For this the engine of the service module would not be required
But the risk was that
it would take 45 days to return to Earth
Did the astronauts have enough oxygen and water left?
NASAs flight director chose the second option
To take the long way back
The astronauts were told to shut down the CSM module immediately
And while returning
they were told to use the lunar module as a lifeboat
Though this decision was a safe option it did have several problems
The lunar module was designed in such a way that
only two astronauts could sit in it
for about 20 hours
Because as I told you
its original purpose was to land on the moon
and get attached to the CSM module again
But now it was expected that
these three people would sit in the lunar module
for 45 days
The engines of the lunar module were not designed in a way that
they could be fired repeatedly
To a large extent this was also a risky manoeuvre
To conserve supplies and energy
the astronauts were told to shut down all nonessential systems in the spacecraft
including the heaters that were installed
It was very important to save electricity
As per this plan the astronauts sat in the Lunar Module
and for the first time the engines of the Lunar Module were fired
When an engine is started it is called a Burn
So they do the first Burn
to get on the new path
With the help of this burn
they reached the other side of the moon
The far side of the moon
They became the first humans in the world
to go so far from the Earth
And this record remains unbeatable even now
At their furthest point they were 400000 km away from the Earth
If they stayed on this path
they could reach the Earth about 153 hours after launch
But this time margin was very risky
If they reached Earth after so long
then only 1 hour of surplus food water and oxygen would remain for the astronauts
NASA team on the ground believed that this margin is very narrow
Thats why the astronauts were told to
burn the lunar module engine for the second time
The engineers in the mission control had done many calculations
to find out whether the lunar module engine
will be able to handle the second burn or not
These calculations proved correct
when the second burn is done
the flight time of 153 hours
was reduced to 143 hours
An 11hour long margin of survival
Before the astronauts could relax
another problem arose
The high concentration of carbon dioxide
In spaceships apart from oxygen tanks
there are canisters of lithium hydroxide to remove carbon dioxide
When astronauts breathe in oxygen
they breathe out carbon dioxide
If that carbon dioxide is not removed
it will result in a large amount of carbon dioxide which can be problematic
That is why canisters of lithium hydroxide are used
so that carbon dioxide reacts with it
and becomes lithium carbonate
But the problem here was that
the canisters of lithium hydroxide in the lunar module
were enough for only two people to survive for 2 days
But here there were 3 people
who wanted to survive for 4 days
The good thing here was that
there were some canisters in the command module too
But their filter was square
and the ones in lunar module had a circular shape
The experts on the ground had 24 hours to solve this problem
Astronauts from the spacecraft communicated to tell them
about all things present around them
Plastic bags cardboard some suit hoses some duct tape
They wanted to create something that could be the solution to this problem
After a few hours of experimenting
they make a contraption to make this work
After giving stepbystep instructions
a new device was created with the things present there
with which the level of carbon dioxide decreases again
Commander Lovell in his book Lost Moon states that
the contraption wasnt very handsome but it worked
The thing they made looked like this
In this entire rescue mission even the smallest details were taken care of
Astronauts were instructed
not to drink more than 200 ml of water in a day
Because if they drink more water
they will need to ur!nate
And in this way the quantity of their ur!ne
could change the direction of the spaceship
Thats why they needed to survive by drinking so little water
These 3 astronauts lost 14 kgs of weight in total
Astronaut Haise gets a urinary tract infection
After 4 days when Apollo 13s spacecraft reaches Earth
astronauts realize that they need to burn once more
In their calculations
they hadnt taken into account the cooling vapour present in the spacecraft
This caused the spacecraft to wander off the track
Commander Lovell carried out another burn of the lunar module
which brings the spacecraft back on track
Thankfully the spacecraft could withstand the third burn too
Even though this lunar module was designed to withstand only one burn
The whole world was holding their breaths and watching the news channels
And were waiting for the astronauts to return to Earth
The family members and friends of the astronauts
were watching this play out on TV together
Now the biggest question was
when this broken spacecraft enters the Earths atmosphere
will the spacecraft be about to sustain the heat impact?
Will the astronauts be able to survive?
For this part the astronauts had to return to the command module
because only the command module was made for reentry on the Earth
As soon as the command module entered the Earths atmosphere
there was a communication blackout
This was normal because
due to ionization of the air
the radio waves get blocked
and communication cannot be done
between the NASA employees present on the ground
and the astronauts in the spacecraft
Usually this communication blackout is for 2 to 3 minutes
It was expected that the communication blackout here
would be for a maximum of 3 minutes
3 minutes were over
but there was no answer from the other side
10 seconds pass
30 seconds
60 seconds
Even after 4 minutes
there was no communication from the spacecraft
Could the astronauts survive or not?
4 minutes and 27 seconds later
finally communication was received from the other side
The people watching it on television could finally breathe again
All three astronauts survived
The parachute was deployed in the command module
and it slowly fell into the Pacific Ocean
Teamwork was necessary
Good leadership
Initiative to think outside of the box
When things go wrong
how do we repair them?
Those are the three things
that were absolutely necessary
The three astronauts return home safe and sound
Although this mission failed
none of the three astronauts set foot on the moon
But still this Apollo 13 mission
made its mark on the pages of history
Showing this historical rescue mission of the Apollo 13
and the bravery of the astronauts
Several books are written on it
and films are made
After the investigation of this incident
many safety measures are adopted by NASA
So that there could be no such accidents in future missions
After Apollo 13
Apollo 14 Apollo 15
Apollo 16 and Apollo 17
all these missions were successful
On 7th December 1972
Apollo 17 was the last mission
by NASA under the Apollo program
The astronauts in this mission spent 3 days on the surface of the moon
And this was the last time till today
when humans went to the moon
You will get the answer to this question in my Apollo 11 video
In that video I discussed Neil Armstrongs mission
World War II is the most devastating war in human history
Numerous large cities were left crumbling after this war
Today nearly all geopolitical events
and international relations can be traced back
to this War
Friends Ive told you many stories from WWII
in previous videos
But in this video come lets understand WWII in depth
Starting to end
What happened exactly?
And what was its impact?
This is the story of World War II
It is difficult to track down
one single event
that sparked the conflict
For ultimately it was a series of events
that conspired together
To eventually light a flame of war
The worlds most hated treaty
the Treaty of Versailles
thus starting World War II in 1939
The whole world is
against Hitler and Hitlerism
Lets begin this story in 1919
The year when World War I ended
And the famous peace treaty was signed
known as the Treaty of Versailles
This treaty contained an important clause
Article 231
Which held that
all the losses caused due to World War I
Germany was to bear the responsibility for all such losses
This clause is also known as War Guilt Clause
because basically it was trying to imply
that regardless of the countries participating in the war
Germany was to be blamed for it entirely
France and Britain wanted
Germany to pay heavy costs for losing this war
They wanted to recover their losses from Germany
As a result according to the Treaty of Versailles
Germany was told to pay a fine of 33 Billion to the other countries
In todays money it amounts to around 270 Billion
This is such a large amount that you wont believe that
it was only in 2010
Germany made the final payment of this fine
It took almost 100 years
Youd wonder where this money comes from
Obviously from Germany
From its citizens
The first payment of this fine was made by Germany in 1921
right after that there was hyperinflation in Germany
Germanys currency back then was the German Mark
you cant imagine how rapidly it was devalued
In 1922 in Berlin a packet of bread cost 160 Marks
The following year in 1923
the same packet of bread cost 200 Billion Marks
Obviously the economy was crippled
And the rate of unemployment rose rapidly
In such circumstances in our story entered
Adolf Hitler
A young political leader
who knew how to manipulate the masses with his speeches
In 1923 Hitlers Nazi Party
tried to overthrow the German government
By staging a coup
Even though this attempt failed
this caused Hitlers popularity among the masses to increase manifold
Rumours were spread among the people
that the embarrassment faced by Germany
the international humiliation of Germany
were because of the antinational elements living in the country
People were distressed
It was easy to manipulate them
Hitler claimed that the Jews and Socialists living in the country
were to be blamed
They were the reason for Germanys disgrace
Over the next 10 years propaganda was used in abundance
media organisations were paid hate speeches were everywhere
I wont go into its details
because I talked about these in the video on the rise of Hitler
In case you havent watched it Ill add the link in the description below
In 1929 came the Great Depression
This worsened the already bad unemployment situation
in 1933 6 million people were unemployed in Germany
Many people were homeless
Children were starving to death
As a result in 1933
Hitler declared himself the Dictator of Germany
After taking over full control of the country
Hitler started working on making his dream of a German Empire come true
German Reich
A state that would be racially pure
Its residents would be people of the Aryan race only
There would be no space for Jews and Slaviks
To fill people with hatred
they came up with the Judeo Bolshevism conspiracy theory
According to this conspiracy theory
the Russian Revolution in 1917
was supposedly caused by the Jews
Which eventually led to the formation of the Soviet Union
In 1935 the rest of the world came to know that
Germany had an air force
This might not seem like a big deal to you
after all every country has its air force
But friends the Treaty of Versailles laid down the condition
that Germany cannot have any form of military power
This was an open violation of the Treaty of Versailles by Hitler
But by this point in time many people in Britain believed that
the contents of the Treaty of Versailles
were very unfair to Germany
They were asking for such a large ransom
that crippled the country
And the country wasnt even allowed to have military
people consider it to be very demanding
In June 1935 Britain signed the AngloGerman Naval Agreement
This formally recognised that
Hilter had the authority to form his navy
Germany could have an independent navy
But the growing militarisation in Germany
alerted France
France built a 450 km long fortification on its Eastern border
This was named the Maginot Line
In 1938
when Hitler believed that his military was sufficiently prepared
he focused his attention on their neighbour Austria
Austria was a musthave country for Hitler
He wanted all Germanspeaking countries
to unite as one nation
His ultimate goal was not only to
conquer as many countries as possible to satisfy his pride
but also to acquire its resources
to advance his own country
The people Hitler believed to be racially superior
his Aryan race
he wanted to give them Lebensraum
To give them living space
So that they could live freely
In February 1938 Hitler met Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg
he was forced into signing an agreement
The agreement allowed Hitler to
place proNazi people on the Austrian government
The Austrian government was infiltrated
by appointing his own people
For example Dr Hans Fischbck
He was supposed to be the new finance minister of Austria
He was a Nazi
and the other Nazis who were in jail
were set free by him
Within a month things were out of control
Austrian Chancellor knew that if the infiltration was to be stopped
the people needed to be consulted first
Whether Austria should be an independent country
or be a united country with the Nazis
He decided to have a national vote for it
As soon as Hitler found out about the national vote
Hitler took his army and marched into Austria
The German military entered Vienna
But the Austrian Chancellor wanted no bloodshed
He resigned from his seat
Hitler used his propaganda ministry to spread fake news
Of riots happening in Vienna
And how the Communists were responsible for the riots
And so the Austrian government asked the German army
to help them protect Austria
The next day the Austrian Parliament was dissolved
And Austria ceased to be an independent country
This invasion was successful without any bloodshed
A major reason for this was that
at this point many people in Austria were in Hitlers favour
They were victims of the propaganda
They believed Hitlers invasion would help them
That Hitler could make their country into a superpower
After taking over Austria
Hitler moved on to the next country
On Czechoslovakias border there was the region
Of the people living here around 3 million were Germans
Hitler used that as an excuse to claim
that region as Germans
due to the Germans living there
Here British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain came into the picture
He wanted to avoid a war at all costs
He believed that if Hitler was given what he wanted
he would stay calm and there would be no wars
This is why in September 1938
the Munich Agreement was signed
The settlement of the Czechoslovakian problem
which has now been achieved
is in my view
only the prelude
There are larger settlements
in which all Europe may find peace
Under this agreement this region of the Sudetenland
was to be given to Germany
only if Hitler promised that there would be no more wars
Hitler gladly took this piece of Czechoslovakian land
but not even 1 year passed
before he violated the Munich Agreement
March 1939
Hitler took his army to invade the rest of Czechoslovakia
People fought for the first time
But the German army won easily
and the country was split into 2
One part was included in the German territerritory
and the second part was made a Nazi client state
A puppet government was placed
under the name of the Slovak Republic
British Prime Minister Chamberlain faced heavy criticism due to this
At this point in time Winston Churchill famously said
Hitler looked for the next country
To take control of Poland
in a sly move Hitler signed a NonAggression Pact with the Soviet Union
in 1939
At first glance youd think that Hitler hated
the Soviet Union and Communist ideology
So why would he do this?
The only reason for this was
to invade Poland
The Soviet Union wanted a part of Poland too
In this situation the interests of the two nations were aligned
On 1st September 1939
nearly 1 million German troops started moving towards Poland
They planned on attacking from the North and South simultaneously
Other countries were shocked at this
The UK and France were at the edge of their patience
If Hitler continued invading one country after the other
the next number could be theirs
How will the world cope?
They couldnt tolerate it any longer
The UK gave an ultimatum to Hitler
If they went ahead with Polands invasion
they would declare war against Germany
Hitler ignored the ultimatum
And with this the UK officially declared
a war against Germany
After this France Australia New Zealand
South Africa and Canada declared war on Germany too
UKs Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain
broadcasted this announcement on the radio
But friends at this point in time
World War II hadnt actually begun
This period is known as the Phony War
Because there was no real war yet
Though technically these countries had declared war on Germany
none of these countries
provided military support to Poland
Polands army was extremely oldfashioned
Their army still used horses
They couldnt last against Germanys military strategy
Neither Britain nor France could save them
Nearly 13 million people were mobilised in Poland
but it didnt even take 1 week for the German army to defeat them
On 8th September 1939
German troops occupied Poland
Friends here its important to mention
Hitlers revolutionary warfare strategy
Known as Blitzkrieg
Using this Hitler successfully invaded several countries
This military strategy focused on speed and stealth
They used tanks to invade the countries so quickly
that their opponents didnt have the time to think
And then their air force would join from above
It was known as Luftwaffe
And the invasion took place at a lightning speed
In German Blitz means lightning
Hitler focused on making the wars as small as possible
A war that could be wrapped up quickly
Within less than a week
To maintain this Blitzkrieg
German soldiers were given drugs
A drug by the name of Pervitin was quite common
Today we know it as Crystal Meth
Confidential military communications
revealed that the Allies suspected that
the Nazis were using something
to supercharge their troops
But they had no idea what it was
When this drug is taken
it takes away fatigue
One doesnt need sleep
It suppresses hunger and thirst
reduces pain
and gives a confidence boost to the user
Giving such drugs to soldiers proved enormously advantageous
Even if it was extremely harmful to their longterm health
in the short term it was very useful in winning these wars
The defending soldiers would waste their time by sleeping at night
while the German soldiers could fight day and night
and finish the task within 23 days
As we move forward with the story youd see
how successful the Blitzkrieg military strategy was for Germany
Now back in Poland
Not only was Poland invaded by Hitler
but the Soviet Union was also invading it from the other side
After it was defeated it was partitioned into two
Half of it went to Nazi Germany
And the other half to the Soviets
The logic used by the Soviets was that
before the Russian Revolution
the area actually belonged to the Soviets
And so they deserved it
But from the Soviets perspective there was another country
which was a part of the Russian Empire before 1917
Stalin was worried that Germany would invade Finland
Stalin couldnt really trust Hitler
The worst problem with it wouldve been that
the city of Leningrad where Stalin resided
was only 50 km from the Finnish border
Had Finland been actually occupied by Nazi Germany
they wouldve been too close to Stalins home
So without waiting for Hitler to try to occupy Finland
the Soviet Union asks Finland to hand over their territory to the Soviets
Obviously Finland refused
And so the Soviets launched military action
against Finland in November 1939
What was Soviet leader Joseph Stalin thinking exactly?
What were his ideologies?
To understand this better Id recommend

This was an imbalanced war too
Soviet Unions army was much larger than Finlands
They had better equipment too
But this war lasted for more than 2 months
And the Soviets couldnt gain much
Finally in March 1940 this battle was over
And the Moscow Peace Treaty was signed
According to this 11 of Finlands land
would be handed over to the Soviet Union
In the meanwhile Hitlers focus wasnt actually on Finland
He was looking at Norway and Denmark
In April 1940 Hitler prepared his plans
on how he could establish control over Norway and Denmark
On 9th April 1940
Hitler used his Blitzkrieg strategy
to invade Norway and Denmark
This invasion didnt last long either
Both were small countries
How could they compete against the German Army?
The Norwegian government fled to London
and in London a Government in Exile was set up
In Norway Hitler established his puppet proNazi government
British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain
accepted his failure
The failure to protect so many neighbouring countries
from the Nazi invasion
Due to this on 10th May 1940
he resigned from the position of Prime Minister
The seat of the Prime Minister and its responsibilities
were handed over to the infamous Winston Churchill
On the same day 10th May
Hitler launched an attack on
France Belgium Netherlands and Luxembourg
This was a declaration of an allout war
Everyone could see that Hitler didnt intend to stop
how France had built the Maginot Line because they were worried
that Hitler would attack their country
They were building a wall at the border
The French troops lined the wall
to protect their country
is the fate of Holland and Belgium
like that of Poland
and Czechoslovakia
and Austria
will be decided by the victory
of the British Empire
On the borders of Belgium and Luxembourg
the Allied forces were stationed to protect them
Hitler used his trademark Blitzkrieg strategy
More than 1000 fighter bomber airplanes
around 3 million soldiers on the ground as the offence for Germany
this was known as the Battle of France
The German troops were divided into 3 groups
A B and C
Group B was to attack the Netherlands
And then enter Belgium to fight the Allied forces
Group C was to attack the Maginot Line
And are you wondering what was Group A supposed to do?
Group A was the master plan
Group Cs attack on Maginot Line
was merely a distraction
so that Group A could sneakily execute the master plan
Entering France through the Ardennes Forest
This was a vast forest
was believed to be a strong fortress by Frances military experts
They assumed that the German army would never be able to come through it
because it would be too difficult
They didnt expect the German army to invade via this forest
More than 40000 military vehicles were used
by Group A to enter France through this forest
On 15th May 1940
they captured Sedan
and started travelling Northwards
The British army fighting Group B in Belgium
were shocked to see the suddenness
with which the large force attacked them from behind
The soldiers were surrounded by the Nazi army from three sides
They had only 1 way to escape
Through the sea
Near the port of Dunkirk
So they planned to escape from there
What happened in Dunkirk was a historical turn of events in WWII
Nearly 400000 allied troops were stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk
When Im using the term Allied
it basically refers to the British and French armies
The countries fighting Hitler
their group or their collation is known as the Allies
And the countries fighting in support of Hitler
are known as the Axis Powers
It was crucial to save the Allied soldiers in time
because the Nazi army was moving towards them at great speeds
They had no other way of escape
They could evacuate only through the sea
If this couldnt be done in time 400000 troops could be killed there
It wouldve been a huge drawback for Britain and France
They might have lost their countries forever
Winston Churchill made a plan to evacuate the soldiers
On 26th May 1940
Operation Dynamo was launched
The biggest evacuation in military history
On land the German army had reached the beaches
They were firing at the troops
The German airforce was attacking from above
Christopher Nolan made the amazing film Dunkirk
which masterfully depicts the events that took place there
This film focuses on 3 areas of evacuation
First British Royal Air Forces counter attack
The British ships which were coming to evacuate the Allied soldiers
were given cover by the British air force
To protect the ships
Second some private fishing boats in the English Channel
and the common civilians joined in to help in the evacuation
And third the events that took place on Dunkirks beach
The soldiers trying to save themselves
and helping each other
4th June 1940
Nearly 350000 soldiers were successfully evacuated
As you wouldve seen in the film as well
But the bad news was that
most of the military equipment of the Allied forces was used up in this evacuation
Some days later on 22nd June 1940
France surrendered to Hitler
By this point in time in Italy
was under the rule of Dictator Mussolini
He formed an alliance with Hitler
to wage war against France
The alliance of Italy and Germany
was known as the Pact of Steel
The two countries declared war against France and Britain
on 10th June
By July 1940 the situation was that
Hitler had established control over nearly all neighbouring countries
Austria Poland Denmark
Norway Belgium
Luxembourg the Netherlands
and France
At this point in time
Hitlers Germany Britain and the Soviet Union
Germany and the Soviet Union had a Peace Agreement
So Hitler neednt be wary of the Soviet Union
He believed that the Soviets wouldnt attack Germany
He thought that Britain was the only remaining fighting Germany
Youd be wondering about Americas role
Friends America wasnt involved in WWII yet
America was standing back
because after World War I
America wasnt interested in
interfering with Europes situation
It was clear that
had they stopped fighting at this point in time
Hitler wouldve been the clear victor
Hitler had a major upper hand
So how did the situation take a Uturn?
And Britain could defeat Germany?
We shall fight on the landing grounds
We shall fight in the fields
and in the streets
We shall fight in the hills
We shall never surrender!!
Friends lets talk continue this story in the next video
part 2 of the video on World War II
I know what youre thinking
this might sound vague to you
that youd have to wait months for the part 2
dont worry about that
I wont torment you with the suspense for too long
Because this time around both videos were shot together
and edited together
Till then you can watch this video
in which I explained how Hitler used propaganda
to brainwash German citizens
Basically the way Hitler took over the government and control
Theres an interesting angle to this story
involving Albert Einstein
And Ill see you in the next video
On the night of December 3 1984  at approximately midnight
In Bhopals train station Bhopal Junction
the station superintendent HS Bhurvey
and the deputy station superintendent
Ghulam Dastagir were on duty
Around 1 oclock
the GorakhpurBombay Express arrived at the station
prompting Dastagir to leave his cabin
Suddenly he experienced burning eyes and a sore throat
Concerned he searched for Bhurvey  his superior to inform him about this
but couldnt find him
Moments later he found Bhurvey lying on the ground
Dastagir tried to check whether he was breathing
but realized that Bhurvey had passed away
Dastagir immediately understood the cause
The thing is that a kilometre away from Bhopal Junction
in the Union Carbide factory
there had been a hazardous incident
releasing 50000 pounds of poisonous gas
including MIC hydrogen cyanide and phosgene
The gases were spreading rapidly all over the city
As the most senior person present Dastagir took charge
deciding that the Gorakhpurbound train  needed to leave before its scheduled departure
even though it was supposed to  stay at the station for 20 more minutes
The passengers of the train had the windows closed
and Dastagir didnt want
the passengers to be harmed in any way
With passengers safety in mind  Dastagir broke protocol
and ordered the station staff to  clear the way for an early departure
And he assumed all responsibilities of breaking this protocol
Meanwhile the crowd at the station was growing
The incident occurred during the night  when most people were asleep at home
Some individuals facing difficulty breathing
took refuge in their cars and tried to leave the city
But on the other hand those without vehicles
gathered at the station
unsure of what to do
More and more people kept coming to Bhopal Junction
People were coughing crying  and vomiting all around the station
Dastagir was running from one platform to the other
trying to help the people in any way he could
He made an SOS call to the nearby stations
after which 4 ambulances paramedics and  railway doctors reached the station to help people
Despite all efforts escaping the poisonous gas proved challenging
While on one hand some had fled  their homes to reach the station
on the other hand more people headed to hospitals
Obviously if someone experiences burning eyes  and breathing difficulties while sleeping at night
theyll go to a hospital
However the challenge was that
neither the railway doctors nor the hospital staff understood
the nature of the situation
These symptoms were unfamiliar to them
and they struggled to identify the illness or its cause
3 km from the Union Carbide factory
was Bhopals Hamidia Hospital
At the time the hospital had a capacity of approximately 1200 beds
Around 115 AM
the first patient arrived
complaining of eye irritation
Within the next five minutes
over 1000 people had gathered at the hospital
Some doctors attempted to obtain  information from the union carbide factory
but they didnt provide any useful information
The companys medical officer LD Loya told the doctors
that the gas was not poisonous
and advised the application of  wet bandages to the eyes
Meanwhile the Superintendent of Police  Swaraj Puri visited the control room
and saw that his staff was coughing  helplessly and rubbing their eyes
That was around 125 AM
He called the carbide factory
on the first two phone calls  he received assurances of
everything being okay
However after the third call
the response was uncertain
the people at the factory claimed that  they didnt know what had happened
We dont know what has happened
By 210 AM
the hospital had admitted around 4000 patients
and chaos was unfolding at Bhopal Junction Station
Dastagir had ensured that the  Gorakhpur Bombay Express had left the station
but aiding people became increasingly challenging
He later learned that his senior HS Bhurvey
had lost his life while directing another train to leave Bhopal
his senior had instructed the train not to stop at the platform
And to keep moving
Ghulam Dastagir his wife and their 4 children
lived in old Bhopal
Merely 3 km from the Union Carbide factory
But Dasgir didnt leave the station to check on his family
He remained at the station  dedicated to assisting those in need
Trains arriving at the station were prevented from stopping
they were asked to keep going
Manzoor Ahmed Khan Dasgirs colleague was
among the individuals arriving at the station to leave Bhopal
Around 3 AM he arrived at the station with their entire family
Observing Dastagir tirelessly moving from platform to platform
assisting people selflessly without concern  for his own safety or that of his family
Friends there is a new series on Netflix The Railway Men
Inspired by these reallife stories
How these unknown and unsung heroes
were grappling with the poisonous gas that fateful night
This series is the first series by Yash Raj Entertainment to be released on an OTT platform
Watching the trailer will give you
a clear sense of the suspense and thrill  embedded in the story of that night in this series
On one hand the doctors and paramedics at the stations and hospitals
were working tirelessly to save lives
On the other hand they didnt truly know
how to treat the cause of the symptoms
Most of the doctors administered eye drops  to reduce the burning sensation in the eyes
steroids to treat the inflammation
and antibiotics to prevent secondary infection
and antacids to treat stomach problems
The real solution though
depended on identifying the gas
Whether it was MIC Phosgene  or another gas like hydrogen cyanide
Initially doctors suspected phosgene poisoning
because there was a similar incident 3 years prior to this
in the same Union Carbide factory
In December 1981
resulting in the d3ath of a person working in  this factory Ashraf Muhammad Khan
Due to a phosgene leak
Conversely the company downplayed the severity claiming it was MIC
and advising simple remedies like wet bandages for eye irritation
Notably MIC vaporizes at 38C
a considerably high temperature
Whereas phosgene vaporizes at 8C
Given the December climate in Bhopal
doctors assumed phosgene to be the culprit
No one knew that at the time of this incident in the factory
the factorys temperature was around 400C
Meanwhile in America Carbides medical director Bipin Awasia
informed Bhopal authorities
that if cyanide poisoning was suspected
sodium thiosulfate should be administered as an antidote
In earlier experiments it was observed that
MIC breaks down into hydrogen cyanide during combustion
And hydrogen cyanide could be countered  effectively by sodium thiosulfate
But Bipin Awasia retracted his statement 10 days  later during a press conference in Bhopal
asserting that there was no cyanide poisoning
rendering the antidote useless
The company issued a statement
clarifying that MIC is not cyanide
and that the two should not be confused
emphasizing that MIC naturally degrades into the environment
when exposed to water
However this clarification from the company was very late
by then numerous patients were  in the hospital awaiting treatment
To help the distressed patients
on December 8th German toxicologist Max Daunderer
arrived in Bhopal with 50000 doses of sodium thiosulfate
When doctors used sodium thiosulfate
it proved quite successful
with many patients recovering
Unfortunately one patient d!ed after its administration
This led to widespread rumours that
a German doctor had k!lled a patient with sodium thiosulfate
Consequently the doctor and his antidotes were sent back
Senior professors at Gandhi Medical College  rejected the use of sodium thiosulfate
Dr M N Nagu the director of Madhya Pradeshs health services at the time
published a circular on 13th December stating that
under no circumstances shall sodium thiosulfate be given
unless it is correctly and conclusively proved in the laboratory
that it is cyanide poisoning
Despite this stance some remained convinced that
these patients were suffering from cyanide poisoning
First because when sodium thiosulfate  was being administered on some patients
positive effects were observed
And second because when Bhopal Medical  Legal Institutes Director Dr Hirish Chandra
conducted autopsies on the bodies
he found evidence of cyanide poisoning
He reiterated that sodium thiosulfate should be used
Weeks later in February
ICMR instructed doctors
to use sodium thiosulfate
The biggest question here was Why was there so much confusion?
The company that owned the factory
why did they create so much confusion about MIC and cyanide?
The direct answer is
The company was in the midst of a huge compensation claim
they wanted to minimize the side effects of MIC to save money
Government authorities were also caught in this confusion
resulting in the unfortunate d3ath of many  individuals who could have been saved
had they received the correct and timely treatment
Ghulam Dasgir the person I talked about at the beginning of this video
managed to save himself
But the last 19 years of his life
were mostly spent in the hospital
he passed away in 2003
What makes the Bhopal gas tragedy  particularly shocking is that
numerous warnings by various people  had been given before the incident
Many had voiced concerns
alerting authorities that the factory posed a constant danger
due to the lack of safety measures
Regrettably neither the company nor the government authorities
took any preventive action
In 1981 when Ashraf Khan lost his life in a Carbide accident
three experts from the US were sent by the company in May 1982
to assess the plants safety measures
Their report identified over 60 hazards
highlighting issues such as
the emergency evacuation procedures werent  shared with the people living near the factory
and that the MIC tanks could be easily contaminated
The tank pressure gauge was apparently defective
The issues and warnings raised in this report
were published in three articles
Save This City
Bhopal is Sitting on a Volcanos Mouth
Youll Perish If You Dont Take This Seriously
These articles were published in a local newspaper Rajpath
by a journalist Rajkumar Keswani within two weeks
Keshwanis last article on the Bhopal plant
was published on June 16 1984
in the national newspaper Jansatta
warning of a situation of looming disaster in Bhopal
This underscores the vital role of
independent and free media in the country
The truth is Keswani didnt do anything extraordinary
He simply carried out his job with honesty
And thats why today he emerges as an unsung hero
In his last article he made another major revelation
that in 1975 Bhopal Municipal Corporation
was headed by a highly respected bureaucrat MN Buch
He had issued a notice to remove Carbide from Bhopal
Consequently Buch was transferred
and Carbide paid 25000 to the Corporation
for the construction of a public park
With this Keswani hinted at
a collusion within the government to aid Carbide
in successfully continuing its factory operations
Similar narratives are explored in The Railwaymen series
you can watch it on Netflix
For a deeper understanding of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy
and the subsequent developments involving the company
and the events leading to the incident that night
I have explained these in this video
You can click here to watch that video
Shahrukh Khans newly released film Jawan
is breaking all records
This film is getting a lot of love from the public
But do you know that more than half of the incidents shown in this film
are inspired by real life?
You will be shocked to know how
significant is the connection between the things shown in this film and real life
In this video I wont give any major spoilers of plot points of the film
So even if you havent seen the film
you can watch this video without any hesitation
In fact if you havent seen the film
you may get more curious to watch the film
after seeing the real issues in this video
Lets start with the second big scene  of the first half of the film
which is set in a government hospital
In the film Jawan it is shown how
young children in government hospitals die of encephalitis
because oxygen may not be available
In the film a very sincere doctor Iram is shown
who tries her best to save the children
But after this incident is made public
the government frames this doctor instead
A false accusation is put on her
and she goes to jail
Something similar happened in August 2017
in real life in the city of Gorakhpur
In a government hospital BRD Medical College
63 children died within 3 days
when the piped oxygen supply of the hospital ran out
Dr Kafeel Khan was working as a paediatrician at that time
When he came to know that the oxygen  supply in the hospital was nearly over
he tried to inform the authorities
Since there was no response
he tried to procure oxygen supply from himself
at his own expense
He is seen as a reallife hero
But when the news of this incident reached the media
the blame is shifted on the Dr Kafeel
The government accused him of medical negligence and corruption
He was suspended from his job
arrested and then he was in jail for 9 months
In an interview he reveals how mercilessly he was beaten in jail
He was starved for 45 days
He was in such a bad condition that  he couldnt sleep on his back for months
They used to make me naked
they used to beat me with a stick
They didnt give me food and water for 45 days!
In April 2018 he finally got bail from Allahabad High Court
The court stated that there was no evidence of his wrongdoing
In 2017 an inquiry panel was set up
to investigate the allegations against him
Even the panel stated that
the allegations against him are baseless and inconsistent
In fact this panel report states that
on 11th and 12th August
due to his honest efforts
more than 500 jumbo oxygen cylinders were  delivered to this hospital by different companies
The film Jawan shows how when the doctor had no other option
she started giving Ambu bags to the parents
This happened in real life too
During the Gorakhpur tragedy there were reports
that when oxygen was depleted
parents were using Ambu bags to save their childrens lives
They were trying their best
and many parents saw their children dying in front of their eyes
Dr Kafeel said that
he was made a scapegoat
and that it was a manmade tragedy
More than 30 letters were written to the authorities of BRD Medical College
and to the UP government
Bills of 63 million rupees were pending
to the oxygen suppliers
which were not paid for months
Again and again the letters asked them
to pay the oxygen suppliers
so that the oxygen supply to the hospital would not be disrupted
Just one day before the Gorakhpur tragedy
on 9th August
Uttar Pradeshs Chief Minister Adityanath visited this hospital himself
I made a video on everything that happened at that time
if you havent seen it Ill put the link in the description
We often hear that the state of government  hospitals in the country is very bad
but how bad is it actually?
And what impact does it have on peoples lives?
We got to know this from this film
and from Gorakhpur Tragedy
To improve the condition of these government hospitals
a bold statement is given in the film
It is said that if there is a will
then all these hospitals nationwide
can be improved in just 5 hours
This thing is quite filmy
but in real life I believe that
even if not in 5 hours
but definitely in 2 to 3 weeks
all hospitals can be improved

The second major issue that has been shown in the film is
faulty weapons
Our soldiers are martyred in our country
not by the bullets of the enemy
but because of our own faulty weapons
which are manufactured
by some crony capitalists
In reality there have been many reports on this over the years
In 2012 the Chief General of the Indian Army VK Singh
wrote to PM Manmohan Singh
and said that the Armys tank fleet
was in dire need of critical ammunition
In 2015 retired Lieutenant Colonel Deepak Malhotra
filed a PIL in the Delhi High Court
with the accusation that due to bureaucratic hurdles
our soldiers have to use weapons of poor quality
which puts their lives at risk
In this PIL an interview of an injured soldier was mentioned
in which he talked about how due to defective INSAS
a massacre took place in Chhattisgarh
In 2017 a CAG report mentioned that
40 of the Indian Armys ammunition
is at such low levels that
if a war breaks out
they will not last more than 10 days
In 2018 the Indian Army rejected  Made in India rifles for the second time
Because these Made in India rifles failed badly during trials
These reports are not yet over
Listen to more
In 2020 an internal army assessment flagged that
due to such bad weapons
In the last 6 years 403 accidents have taken place
and 27 soldiers have been martyred
at a loss of 96 billion rupees
These weapons were supplied by the Ordnance Factory Board
After this in September 2022
last years Bloomberg report states that
because of PM Modis MakeInIndia push
our defence forces are not able to import some critical weapons systems
Because of this India is quite vulnerable to  threats coming from China and Pakistan
I would like to show you a report from this year
In the last 5 years around 55 soldiers have lost their lives
in more than 50 aircraft and helicopter accidents
In a bigger time frame
there was a report in 2022
which stated that more than 400 MiG21s crashed in the last 60 years
Due to this 200 pilots and 60 civilians lost their lives
This issue was also raised in the film Rang De Basanti if you remember
This is a major plot point of the film
Now lets come to our third big issue
Corporate Funding
corporate money is secretly used
for funding the political parties
In 2017 there was a major development regarding this
Modi government had passed the Finance Bill 2017
through which giving secret donations to political parties was allowed
through Electoral Bonds
This bill also removed the limit
on how much money can be given to a political party in donations
How much money was given?
This year in January a report was published
which said that during 20182022 BJP
received 5270 billion of funding secretly
We dont know who provided this funding
because that was the aim of the bill they passed
They wanted to hide their funding
According to this report during this time
Congress party received 960 billion in funding
and Trinamool Congress received 767 billion
In 2014 Narendra Modi had promised that
he would bring the black money from Swiss banks back to India
For once
the money that has been deposited in  foreign banks by these thieves and robbers
if we bring back the money
even by doing so
every single poor man in India
will get 152 million for free
But what have they done here?
They have hidden all the money that is received by their parties
Now whether it is BJP Congress or any other party
the public cannot know who is funding them
We can just take a guess from the outside
Another thing worth mentioning here is that
there is an expenditure limit
to what a candidate can spend on his political campaign
This depends on the state
but in Lok Sabha elections this limit is  between 75 million to 95 million
If we take the upper limit for every seat in Lok Sabha
543 seats multiplied by 95 million
it is around 5 billion
So technically no political party can spend more than 5 billion
Going over the expenditure limit is not allowed
However the report of the Centre for Media Studies has shown that
the BJP has spent 270 billion  in the Lok Sabha elections of 2019
Just think about the difference
Even if you ignore this report
in November 2019 BJP submitted to the Election Commission
as it is written on the website of the Election Commission
that BJP has spent 1264 billion for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
The maximum limit here is 5 billion
and they are spending 12 billion
In the film Jawan it is shown that the villain of the film
is telling foreign investors how
voters in India can be bought
If you pay 10000 to each voter
they will vote for the payers preferred political party
This is shown wrongly in the film
because 10000 is a huge amount
In our country we see that
people sell their vote for a kilogram of chicken  or a quarter of whisky
Obviously it depends from region to region
on how much money is used to buy voters
But in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
there were seizures worth 3456 billion
It includes cash gold silver alcohol drugs everything
And forget about buying voters
theres a new trend in the market
Political parties buy MLAs
they buy media houses
Casinos horse trading horse racing
And then these MLAs and media houses that have sold themselves
play a game of divide and rule with the public
spreading hatred among the people
so that their political masters can remain in power
The film also raises the issue of the environment of the country
How several industrial factories
pollute our air and water
In the film there was a reference to the Bhopal gas tragedy
which happened in December 1984
I will not talk about this here because
I have made a separate video on this
But it is not about just one tragedy
not about just one incident
This has become so common that it is unbelievable
Just do a random Google search
and see the numerous articles pop up
Lets start in 2006
In Chhattisgarh due to iron ore mining
the water of two rivers got polluted
and 100 villages that were on the banks of the rivers
the villagers living there had to use contaminated water
for their daily needs
In 2013 a report by the Center for Science and Environment shows that
80 of Indian sewage
is dumped untreated into rivers
Who is doing this?
Thousands of factories are dumping untreated sewage in rivers
In 2017 Maharashtras polluting factories  are making its rivers the filthiest in India
In September 2018
Magsaysay Award winner  environmentalist Rajendra Singh said that
the governments Namami Ganga project is failing
In October 2018 GD Agarwal a passout of IIT
became a sadhu
Swami Gyan Swaroop Sananand
To save the River Ganga he went on a fast
His demand was that a Ganga Protection Act be drafted by the government
and a total ban be imposed on
quarrying and stone crushing on the banks of the River Ganga
He had also written a letter to PM Modi
but there was no reply
His fast lasted 111 days
after which he passed away due to starvation
The man who dedicated his life to get River Ganga cleaned
environmentalist GD Agarwal
finally sacrificed himself for River Ganga
After that PM Modi did express his condolences
The budget of the Namami Ganga project was
200 billion
Its deadline was 2021
This year Namami Ganga Mission 2 was approved
With a budget of 225 billion
The deadline was set for 2026
The Minister of State for Jal Shakti Water Resources  clearly told the Rajya Sabha that
this time their main objective
is to meet the water quality criteria of outdoor bathing
Not to make the water of River Ganga drinkable
Only so clean that it becomes bathable
They will try to make it happen by 2026
Lets move ahead there are other rivers as well
This article from 2021
Karnataka dumps 1746 million litres of sewage in the rivers every day
40 untreated
Experts say that factories and industries should be blamed for this
April 2022
the water of the River Hindon in Noida Uttar Pradesh
is so bad that it is not even safe to bathe there
September 2022
the water of the River Damodar in Jharkhand
has become toxic
People are getting sick by using this water
Local power stations and mining companies
dump large mountains of ash in this river to save money
In 2023 the Central Pollution Control Board says that
there are 413 industries in Haryana in total
which are discharging untreated wastes into the river
Panipat is at number one
with 181 polluting factories
Gurgaon is at number two
with more than 100 such factories
This is why the villain in the film Jawan
openly tells foreign investors in the film
to invest their money in winning elections
to invest in donating to the parties
so that they will get the freedom to do anything in India
To set up as many factories as they want
to use as much cheap labour as they want
to spread pollution and waste
and no one would care
The villain of the film also says that
Indias environmental regulations are very favourable
for big companies
In other developed countries there are a lot of restrictions
that are not there in India
For example some pesticides are banned in other countries
but are allowed in India
The Supreme Court was hearing a petition
demanding a ban on 116 dangerous pesticides
In 2013 the Anupam Verma Committee was constituted
to investigate these dangerous pesticides
This committee reviewed only 66 pesticides
and submitted its report to the government in 2015
But the government remained inactive for years
and when the government took action in 2018
only 12 pesticides were banned by the government
And it said that 6 other dangerous pesticides would be slowly phased out
Out of the 116 dangerous pesticides
they took steps to ban only 18
After this another committee was formed under SK Malhotra
in which some more pesticides were to be reviewed
This committee in 2020 said that
27 pesticides should be banned in India
In 2022 the government formed another committee
And what action did that committee take?
Only 3 pesticides were banned
That too in February 2023
So now you can understand the attitude of the government
They are not worried about the citizens  but about the crony capitalists
If they ban any more pesticides
then the business of these billionaires will be affected
They should not have to bear the loss
In July 2023 the Supreme Court questioned the government
The Supreme Court said that whenever a committee issues a report
instead of taking action on that report
the government makes a second committee
Why is it so difficult
to ban these dangerous pesticides
which are already banned in other countries?
After this we can talk about food safety regulations
Look at this 2017 news
Experts say that poultry farms in India
are using antibiotics
Antibiotics are being given to hens in such heavy doses that
this antibiotic resistance is reaching humans
This means that if humans catch a disease
that has become antibioticresistant
then the antibiotics will not help these humans
After this the government did something good here
in 2017 they set a permissible limit
on how much antibiotics can be given to hens
But look at this news from 2018
Indias farmed chickens
are dosed with the worlds strongest antibiotics
This study was done by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism
which found that a last resort antibiotic Colistin
is being given in heavy doses to many chickens in India
Only in 2019 the Union Health Ministries took action on it
and banned this antibiotic
So even where action is being taken
they are waiting for a report first
only then any action is taken
This should tell you the importance of free media
If all the media in a country has been turned into political representatives
then such reports will not be published
and the government will never have to take any action
Without these reports the government  never takes any action on these things
Compare it with other countries
The European Union banned antibiotics  from being used in animal feed in 2006
They took action so many years ago
This year in January the European Union  came out with a new legislation
which has banned all kinds of antibiotics in farming
And they have also banned
meat that has antibiotics in it
being imported from foreign countries to the European Union
Now see how these multinational food companies
take advantage of the indifference of the Indian government
In 2017 KFC was praised in America
because they committed not to use antibiotics in their chicken
In the same year Burger King McDonalds Pizza Hut and Taco Bell
all took this pledge
There will be no antibiotics in their chicken
But did any of these fast food companies
make such a commitment in India?
Center for Science and Environment  reached out to these companies in 2020
and they did not respond to this issue
In the movie Jawan it is also shown how
the government forgives the bad loans of these billionaires
If you want to compare it with real life
see this news from just last month
The Minister of State for Finance told the Lok Sabha
that in the last 9 years the banks
have written off 1456 trillion in NPAs
More than half of these were owed by large corporates
And when the banks try to recover these loans
the banks are unable to recover the entire amount
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman  told the Rajya Sabha this year in March
that in the last 5 years the public sector banks
could recover only 14 of the writtenoff loans
Apart from these NPS there are cases of such billionaires
who have taken loans from banks
and fled the country
Like Vijay Mallya Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi
The film Jawan drew an interesting comparison
of loan writeoffs for these billionaires and crony capitalists
And the loans owed by common farmers in the country
Look at this India Spend report of 2019
The cost of the top 12 corporate NPAs
is twice as much as compared to farm loan waivers
Between FY 201718 and February 2019
10 state governments issued farm loan waivers
whose total amount was 1848 billion
But the top 12 NPAs
their total amount is almost twice this
At 345 billion
And when the farmers loan is waived
there is another big difference
If the farmer is unable to repay his loan
he often commits sde
But these billionaires
have you ever heard that they committed sde  because they couldnt repay their loans?
There is a very powerful scene related to this in Jawan
I wont talk much about it
If you have seen the film you will understand
what I am talking about
When a farmer takes a loan
it affects his life entirely
If you see just one year in 2021
more than 10000 people committed sde in the farm sector
The number shown in the film was quite shocking
But the number in real life is close to it
There are farmers in our country that earn substantially
They should be seen as positive examples
so that other farmers can learn from them
Watch this video of Down to Earth
How can a small farmer earn 15 million?
Or watch this video featuring Padma Shree awardee Bharat Bhushan Tyagi
which shows how a farmer earns more  than 500000 per acre annually
Or you can read this article of The Better India
which shows the story of a farmer Raju Titus
All these farmers can earn so much money
because they follow the NFC model
NFC means Nature Farmer Consumer
There may be some minor differences
but what do these farmers do in general?
Number 1 seed preservation
They preserve the seeds in seed banks
They are often members of friendly seed banks
Number 2 they do not use chemical fertilizers
Instead they restore soil fertility
by planting cover crops in between the cash crops
This increases microbial activity in the soil
and increases nitrogen availability
And such farmers often use a compost pit for manure
Number 3 they often get their soil tested in local labs
to find out the most suitable crop to grow in the soil
They also practice crop rotation
Number 4 Monoculture
Instead of planting one type of crop
they carry out intercropping
Multiple crops in one field
That would support each other
Number 5 They do multilayer farming
3 to 4 crops are grown on the same field at different heights
For example coconut coffee and black pepper  can be a combination
Or maize green gram and ground nut
can be another combination
Next they dont use a tractor
They often use notill farming techniques
And they dont use flood irrigation either
Instead they use techniques like sprinkler irrigation or drip irrigation
And instead of using pesticides and insecticides
they use marigolds garlic or brightcoloured sheets
Next they follow the practice of mulching
They cover the remaining area with organic matter
so that weeds can be suppressed
and that water can be retained in the ground
And finally these people dont dump their produce in the market
Instead they are organised in cooperatives
and reach the consumers directly
They dont let middlemen in
This is an amazing model in which
the farmer is happy the consumer is happy  and the environment is also happy
But this model is used rarely
because most of the people who are practising this model
are educated and intelligent
However poor farmers use the corporate model of farming
They buy seeds fertilizers insecticides  pesticides and tractors
They use diesel to run the tube well
They rent a harvesting machine
They burn the leftover stubble
which causes air pollution
As time goes by their soil becomes less fertile
So they keep adding more fertilizers to it
And in the end they dump all their stuff in the market
Often they take a loan for a tractor as well
And their crop often gets destroyed during the rains
This model is very expensive
The revenue for the farmers is meagre
And it has a bad impact on the environment
And because these corporate companies work like middlemen
the consumers have to pay a high price
And most of the profits are taken by these companies in the middle
These companies that make tractors  fertilizers and insecticides
are billiondollar companies
And often the profits cannot reach these farmers
because this knowledge has not reached most of the farmers
The government had promised that by 2022
they would double the farmers income
But its 2023
and the farmers are in the same condition
A while ago the government tried to bring in 3 unfavourable laws
which would have increased the corporate income
But thankfully it didnt pass
What should the government do?
Educate the farmers
To inform the farmers which models they should adopt
What they should be doing to maintain their livelihood
If there is a political will
the government can bring down these farmer sdes to zero
But will this happen?
Or will the YouTubers have to educate the farmers?
Only time will tell
If you liked the video do keep these  issues in mind while watching the film

All of us have an aim in life
If youre a college student
you have assignments you need to complete
If your exams are approaching
you will promise yourself that youll do your best to prepare for the exams
so that you can top the exam
If you are looking for a job
you want to prepare for the job
Why dont you do it?
Were waiting for you to do it
It takes no time for us to decide
what we want to achieve
but then we dont really do what we ought to
Theres an inherent feeling that tells you
that you can do it tomorrow
and that its okay if you relax for a while on Instagram
scroll through the web or watch comedy videos on YouTube
While we put off things for tomorrow we end up wasting time today
And tomorrow never arrives
Theres an English word for it
Why do humans procrastinate?
In todays video lets try to understand it from a scientific perspective
the psychology behind procrastination
and find the real solution to it
Today well talk about laziness
Ive always been lazy my parents are trying to change me but theyre also lazy
Such people have to strong desire to rest
Nothing will happen in the end
You will fail in your comfort zone
Tomorrow Ill be doing what I was supposed to do 2 days ago
What goes on in the heads of procrastinators why we are the way we are?
Rich people dont sleep 8 hours a day
They leave everything up to God they simply eat and sleep
Friends in this video I wont be giving you a motivational lecture
because I believe that motivation is a shortlived phenomenon
If you feel motivated after watching a video
and start working powered with that motivation
you will work well for the next few hours
at most you will be motivated for the next 23 days
but then the motivation would come crashing down
and you stop working
Here wed use science to go to the root cause of procrastination
Dr Piers Steel is one of the leading researchers in the world
on the science of motivation and procrastination
He has been studying this science for over 10 years
He believes that procrastination isnt a problem which
is seen exclusively in this era
It has existed for ages
Thousands of years ago in 1400 BC
Egyptian hieroglyphs have been found
that talk about it
A University of Toronto Egyptologist translated this
Friend stop putting off work
and allow us to go home in good time
About 600 years after this in 800 BC
an ancient Greek poet had said something similar
In India centuries ago Sant Kabir had famously said
youd recall this
Work today instead of putting it off for tomorrow
Work now instead of putting it off for later
If a catastrophe strikes now
when will you prepare for it
He clearly tells you not to put off work for tomorrow
not even for later in the day
or else if everything will end in a moment
you wont be able to finish what you had set out to do
This has been reiterated by many poets and motivational speakers in history
But we have gotten worse
According to Dr Steel
in the last 40 years
there has been a 300 to 400 growth in chronic procrastination
Today half the population in the world
They procrastinate frequently
But why do we do so?
We need to dig deeper
Think about the things you procrastinate doing
When you have to prepare for an exam
or for a job interview
you procrastinate
But have you ever procrastinated while scrolling on Instagram?
Or while watching a comedy video on YouTube?
We procrastinate if it is an office project
Or for exercising
Or if it is something emotional well procrastinate
When I need to say something important
when I have to keep a promise
when I have to reach out to someone
when I have to reconnect with someone
I am always late
Basically we procrastinate when it is something important
Something that requires a lot of effort
Physical mental or emotional effort
We replace that task with something
that is easier and more interesting for us
Such as browsing on social media
Or watching a film
Here deadlines play an important role
If there is a deadline for our task
wherein we need to finish it before the deadline
we procrastinate until we reach the deadline
Suppose we have to make a presentation and submit it tomorrow
even this morning youll feel like procrastinating and scrolling through Instagram
Only for 5 minutes before you begin the project
And were very familiar with how
the 5 minutes turn into 1 hour without us finding out
I have talked about this in detail in the video on Social Media
These websites have been designed in a way that
even if you spend a little time on them
it sucks you in
and this little time turns into a long time
But even if you start working 1 hour later
youll be hungry and start raiding your fridge
so that you can get the energy to study
But after eating you would want to set the mood to be productive
To do so you will start watching comedy videos on YouTube
Another hour wasted in it
and you start feeling tired
so you think that its better to take a shower get freshen up before starting work
Hours pass by and day turns into night
and then an alarm goes off in your mind
you are left with 12 hours only you need to finish it somehow
When it is time to sleep
you start making the presentation
you stay awake the whole night and work on it till the last minute
Several studies have been conducted on college students
Such as the study by Ellis and Knaus in 1977
or by OBrien in 2002
According to these approximately 80 to 90 of college students
But in college at least were given a deadline
so that somehow or the other we complete our work by the end moment
but what happens when there are no deadlines?
Friends in such cases the procrastination may continue infinitely
There is no end to procrastination
Wasting time in college meant that
you dont get good marks
or you may not get a good job
these arent crucial
But procrastinating later in life would mean
that your life may be full of regrets
If you had a dream of trying your hand at filmmaking
to quit your job and become a filmmaker
but you never actually try to make it happen
You would have heard elders say something like
they wanted to become great at something when they were younger
and that they couldnt do it because of circumstances
They say that they used to have big dreams
Often they blame the circumstances
But they know that they didnt try
They are now stuck with a permanent What If feeling
To procrastinate on fitness and exercising means
you will eventually gain weight
nothing major
if you start eating healthy and start exercising
within a few months or years you can lose weight once again
But if you continue procrastinating for years
one day it will come as a shock
that you have diabetes
or youd be told that you need to put in a stunt in your heart
Some people dont even get this chance
They get sudden heart strokes and lose their lives
Apart from this the consequences of procrastinating on emotional stuff are severe
You might dream of taking your grandparents
on an aeroplane one day
but that day may not come
If you keep procrastinating about this
one day you will find out that they passed away
As a result youll be left with heavy regret
Disappointment over these
It is not only about lifetime regret
it brings in stress anxiety and depression as well
The thing you want to do and the thing you are doing
if theres a huge gap between the two
there will be a mental conflict within you
this can be termed Cognitive Dissonance
In a study conducted in a German university on more than 1000 people
it was found that due to procrastination
there are high levels of stress depression anxiety fatigue
it impacts everything
Another feeling that accompanies procrastination is guilt
If we arent happy with procrastination
why do we do it?
Scientists have come up with 4 theories for it
The first is the Expectancy Theory
Given by Victor Harold Vroom in 1964
according to this theory the motivation of a person to do a task
depends upon the expectation of the person with the result
The chances of achieving the result of the task are low
the motivation to do the task will also be low
For example
suppose your school or college tells you
that the person wholl get the first rank in the class
will get a reward of 1 million
will you get motivated to study hard?
Will you work to get the 1st rank?
If you are someone that scores high in your class
and you know that you are always in the top 10
you know that you have a high chance to win this prize money
If so you will study as diligently as you can
and will start working immediately to get the 1st rank
But if you are someone
that lags behind in class
and rank in the bottom
and you know there are more diligent and intelligent students in class
then you know that you have a low chance of winning the prize money
And so your motivation to study will be low as well
There is a direct relation
of the level of your motivation to the expectancy of the result
Remember this
Now lets talk about the second theory
The second theory is the need theory
Coined in the 1960s by famous psychologist David McClelland
He says that there are 3 types of needs of people
Affiliations mean the need for social relationships
Depending upon your personality
your most vital need depends on you
If you are given a task that matches your psychological needs
you will be more motivated to do it
Lets take another example
What do you think our politicians need the most?
Every one of them wants to rule
this shows their strong desire for power
If they are given a task related to that need
they will rush to complete the task
Their motivation will be through the roof
But on the other hand if they are tasked
with working for the people
since they do not have a strong need for that
they will procrastinate on that task
Similarly you have to figure out your dominant need
Your psychological needs
If you have a strong need for power
you will want to succeed at your job
in such cases if you are given a task to get a job promotion
you will have the highest level of motivation to do that task
Understand your needs and look at your tasks from that perspective
Another example is if you have a strong need for affiliation
it means that you respect building connections with people
for maintaining relationships with people
their respect and their approval are of higher priority
then youll excel at the tasks related to team work
The third theory is the Cumulative Prospect Theory
This was coined in 1992 by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman
This theory talks of mainly 2 things
First is loss aversion
It means that if at the same magnitude you will face a profit or a loss
it would be significant for you
and you derive motivation from it
Loss of a particular magnitude
weighs more heavily than
a gain of the same magnitude
The example of exercising that I cited a while back
If I tell you to exercise
so that you are fit and build muscles
the motivation you get from this will only be a little
But if I tell you to exercise
because your test results reveal that you will soon become diabetic
and if the doctor says that if you dont exercise
you might suffer a heart attack within the next year
and that by exercising you can prevent this from happening
your motivation will be much higher than in the last example
Similarly in another example
if I tell you to do something in order to secure a promotion
or if I tell you to do something or else youll be fired from your job
in which case will you be motivated more?
Most people think that
its okay whether they get something extra or not
they shouldnt suffer any losses
They dont want to lose what they have
The second thing that this theory talks about
is that when were talking about gains and losses
it is all relative
The reference point is different for different people
If a person living in a slum
is working diligently to prepare for a job interview
if he gets the job it will improve his life
On the other hand another person who is the child of a landlord
living comfortably and not lacking money
is preparing for the same job interview
and if he gets the job it wouldnt make much difference to his life
think about it of these two who will feel more motivated?
Now lets see the fourth and the last theory
Hyperbolic Discounting Theory
It basically means that the reward that we can get immediately
well want to work for those rewards
as compared to the rewards that we can get after some time
Theres a Hindi proverb about it too
9 in cash is better than 13 as a contingency
Who can guarantee the future?
You need to hold on to the things that you have now
In contrast to this you will have heard statements like
Dont Be Shortsighted
Look at the larger picture
Have a vision
Think of the future
Thinking about the long term is good
but we are more motivated
when we work on something that guarantees instant gratification
Friends these four theories
have been combined in 2006
to form a metatheory
By Dr Piers Steel and Dr Cornelius J Knig
This combined theory was named the Temporal Motivation Theory
According to this combined theory
your motivation to do a task
will not come from watching a motivational video
you will get the motivation to work
when your personal need
matches the work and the reward of the work
When you expect that you can actually do the task
and win the reward
When the reward you get after completing the task
is higher than your reference line
When the reward means something to you
And finally you want the reward as soon as possible without much delay
If all these factors are combined
you will not procrastinate
This can also be represented as a mathematical formula
If you go a level further from procrastination and motivation
and want to eliminate the habit of wasting time in your life
I have built a 2hour long detailed practical course for it
In it I have shared tips on time management productivity
and overall happiness in life
which I apply in my life
which enables me to do so much
Putting up a Shorts video every day
Regular videos on the main channel
the vlog channel and travelling
Last month when I told you about this course
about 1500 people among you have joined it
and I got such amazing reviews
Many of you said that this course was lifechanging for you
In this course you will get daytoday experiences live sessions
a community chat group trainers to explain things
and a Live QA Session with me
Where you can directly ask me questions
Im happy to announce that the next class will begin on 13th August
So those of you who havent joined the course yet
you can do it now
the link to it is the description below
Not only will there be onesided lectures
but you will also be given regular homework
so that you can apply these techniques to your life
the first 1000 people of you to join
will get a discount of 1000
so dont procrastinate on it
and lets get back to the topic
Some scientists have criticised this theory
saying that this theory doesnt cover everything
Psychologists Tim Pychyl and J R Ferrari
have been against this theory
They claim that if everything related to motivation is so rational
if we use this formula to calculate the motivation to watch a YouTube video
and the motivation to study
obviously the motivation to watch YouTube videos would be higher
So why do people experience guilt over it?
Why do people feel bad when they are doing something
that they are more motivated to do?
These two psychologists argued that
in addition to these factors
there is another factor contributing to procrastination
The factor of Fear of Failure
We are scared of failing
Thats why we procrastinate
They claimed this in 2012
If we set aside the other factors
some people are still not motivated to work
because they are scared that theyd fail in the task
so they put aside the task and start doing something else
So whats the conclusion of all of this?
What is the solution to procrastination?
How do we stop procrastination?
The solution to it can be found in these theories
The new theories that are seen as a counter
are not against the previous theories
The actual reason behind procrastination can be any of these
Sometimes it is low expectations
or the needs not matching
or even the fear of failure
Friends the thing is that once you understand these causes
and you use it to identify the reason you procrastinate
the reason why you put off working on things you shouldnt
Then you can curate a solution for yourself
First of all empty your thoughts and take a pen and paper
And ask yourself
Why are you procrastinating?
Only when you write down the cause
you will be able to find the solution to it
identifying the problem
is half the solution
If you are procrastinating at work
thinking that your task is insignificant
and your lack of motivation
then recall loss aversion
Remind yourself that not doing the task may lead to you being fired
And then think about the consequences of being jobless
If you lack motivation because
even after studying hard you know that you cannot get to the top ranks
then go do something where you are confident
that you can perform well in that field of study
or something that you like a lot
and where you can get good results
If you are preparing for a major exam
and the reward seems very farfetched
Or if youll get the reward only after 2 years
then you need to divide the process into smaller steps
After each step give yourself a small reward
So that you can get some instant gratification
If you are scared about taking an important decision
if you are afraid of failing
remember that not trying is worse than failing
We are scared of failure
because we have so much ego
We are scared that if we fail what would the others say?
If I wanted to be a filmmaker
and went to Mumbai but couldnt become one
what would my friends say?
You went to Mumbai to be a filmmaker
but you couldnt be one
I had warned you against leaving your job
but you didnt listen to me
Many people are scared of such statements
For this we need to understand that
our ego is the most useless thing in life
If we are absorbed with what others say about us
if we keep building our life based on the expectations of other people
we will regret it later
I had talked about regrets earlier in this video
about the regrets people have to deal with later in their lives
Remember you too might have to face those
In 1995 Gilovich and Medvec
came up with the Temporal Theory of Regret
According to this theory
actions may produce greater regret in the short term
but inaction will generate more regret in the long run
If you do something now
you may end up doing something that you will regret in the short term
but not doing something will give you more regret in the long term
If you quit your job and follow your dream
and then fail
you will regret it less than
if you had never left your job
the last obstacle between procrastination and you
are the distractions
Social media your phone
this is the last thing I am talking about
because if the other reasons and obstacles to motivation I told you about
is clear to you
you will hardly if ever be distracted by the distractions
But if you are still distracted by things like social media
you should watch this video
In this I have talked about how you can deal with social media addiction scientifically
It has been more than 1 month since the Hindenburg Report was published
Even now new allegations are being levied against the Adani Group one after the other
A few days ago Wikipedia accused the Adani Group
Of manipulating the Wikipedia pages
By using fake accounts and undeclared paid editors
Before this it was discussed in Parliament as well
When Congress leader Rahul Gandhi
And TMC leader Mahua Moitra
Questioned Prime Minister Modi
About his alleged relationship with Adani
A photo was presented at the Parliament
Of Prime Minister Modi with Adani
Which caused a lot of uproars
And later Rahul Gandhis remarks were removed from Parliament records
What were the accusations?
How true are they?
Come in this video lets try to figure it out
Mr Adani and Mr Modi are in it together
The person whose planes PM Modi uses to travel
The person whose fundings run BJP
A slew of deals across sectors from defence to airports to power
Almost always went to the Adani group
All of the funds are going to one person
What is his relationship with Indias Prime Minister?
Before beginning this video
Its important to mention one thing
This isnt the first time that a corporate group is facing severe allegations
Before this we witnessed the Harshad Mehta Scam
Satyam Scam Sahara Scam
Allegations on Vijay Mallya Lalit Modi
Nirav Modi Mehul Choksi
Putting aside corporate groups and individuals
Such accusations have been levied on the previous governments too
The Congress government had to face the
Bofors Scam Augusta Westland Scam
2G Spectrum Scam Commonwealth Scam
But whats happening now has perhaps never happened in the history of the nation
This is the first time that in an alleged scam
Public money was lost
But a faction of the people has come forward
Not to demand an investigation
But rather to defend the company and government
A trend is created on Twitter IStandWithAdani
These people whore supporting Adani
Had they been Adanis employees or investors
It would have been understandable to a large extent
But a significant of them are neither employees nor stockholders of Adani
Even so they are at the front line to defend Adani
Can you imagine someone running a trend of
IStandWithVijayMallya for Vijay Mallyas case?
Imagine someone defending the Commonwealth Games
Saying that there should be no investigation into it
There should be no questions as no wrong was done
This is why friends I believe that the biggest scam here
Is being done with the peoples minds
Basic logic common sense and the basic understanding of democracy
Has been trampled over
They say that Adani shouldnt be questioned
Because Adani is an Indian businessman
That Adani group provides so many jobs
That they have contributed to the development of India
Does this make any sense?
For some basic understanding lets try to understand
The contribution of the Adani Group
Lets look at the jobs
Adani was the richest person in India once
Asias richest person
In fact the second richest person in the world
Then his net worth was 1244 TRILLION!
After the Hindenburg report
The net worth has significantly decreased
But even now at the time of shooting this video
According to Bloomberg his Net Worth is said to be 43 Trillion
Such a wealthy man
With so many companies under his control
So his companies must be employing millions of people right?
You might think that
But according to Adanis official website
The Adani Group employs about 23000 people
Only 23000 jobs
But you might feel that it isnt a fair comparison
And that we should compare it to other private companies only
So lets do that
The number 1 private company that to provide the most number of jobs in India
are the Tata Group of companies
More than 900000 jobs
Then comes Infosys with more than 300000 jobs
Reliance Industries provides 236000 jobs
Wipro provides 231000 jobs
Adanis companies do not appear even in the List of Top 25
Take the government company Coal India
That has 272445 employees
Indian Railways 125 million employees
A company like Amul provides livelihood to 36 million farmers
Overall Indian Agriculture employs more than 150 million people
When you look at the numbers
Adani Group doesnt make a significant contribution to providing jobs in India
Second even if not in terms of jobs
They would have made a large contribution to the taxes
Since they have such a large Net Worth
Take a look at this list compiled by Business Today
Of Indias Top 10 taxpaying companies
At the top is Reliance followed by SBI TCS
HDFC Vedanta JSW Steel
Indian Oil Corporation Tata Steel ICICI LIC
We dont spot Adani on it
Several people pointed this out
Companies of Indias richest person
Arent among the Top 10 taxpayer companies
How could this be?
An explanation for this can be
That tax is levied on profit
Not on Net Worth
So lets take a look at the profits
According to MoneyControlcom
Profit of Adani Enterprises for 12 months as on March 2022
Was 1113 Billion
Dont you think this is suspicious?
The amount of tax paid by the other companies
Is more than the profit made by Adani
If the business isnt very profitable
Why do they have such high valuations?
Did these companies make any groundbreaking innovations?
Or did they create any heavily used technology?
Similar to companies like Apple Google Facebook and Tesla
That doesnt seem like the case
So why?
Perhaps the answer is hidden in the accusations
Come lets look at the new allegations one by one
Especially the allegations from the Indian Parliament
The first allegation is of a Land Scam
This was when Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat
Back then various industrial groups needed land in Gujarat for their projects
So they bought land there
K Raheja Corp bought land at 470m
Maruti Suzuki got land at 670m
Ford India Tata Motors and TCS paid 1100m
Torrent Power had to pay 6000m
But when Adani purchased land to build a port
They were given the land at a mere 32m
This was the maximum
In places the price was as low as 1m
Im not making this up
This is the headline of the Business Standard article from 26th April 2014
So theres an accusation of a land scam
After this in April 2015
CAG presented its report to the Gujarat Assembly
They claimed that the Gujarat government did not classify forest land correctly
Due to this the Goutam Adanipromoted Mundra Port benefitted by 5864 million
This happened in 200809
After this in 2022 the Public Accounts Committee reiterated the same thing
They said that the land was supposed to be classified as Eco Class2
But it was classified as Eco Class4
Which led to the government losing 5867 million
The government losing money means
The loss of public funds
The second accusation is the misutilisation of forest land
Narendra Modi was sworn in as the Prime Minister in 2014
And look at this report in The Times of India from 24th October 2014
Centre clears 370acre forest land for Adanis coalbased thermal power plant
This was in Maharastra
After this in 2018 142 acres of land was further sanctioned
This time by both the Central and State government
Both were headed by BJP at the time
The forest department responded by saying that
The forest land demanded by them was the barest minimum
And that giving this land would eventually lead to an increase in employment
Youll ask about the particulars of employment
They claimed that 100 local residents will get jobs
And indirectly 250 residents
350 jobs in total
In March 2018
Adani Group received inprinciple approval
for using about 1550 hectares of forest land
For the Mundra Special Economic Zone
Regarding this the Forest Advisory Committee said that
most of the forest land would be used for nonforestry purposes
The third accusation is of the Airport Scam
In November 2018
The Cabinet approved the privatisation of 6 airports
Here the privatisation of airports is a big deal on its own
Questions need to be asked
The profitable airports that were making money for the government
Why were they privatised?
As long as a profitable organisation is under the governments control
Its profit goes to the government
That can be later used for public welfare
But if it is privatised
Its profits would go to the corporate company
Only that company would benefit
Earlier the excuse was that
The lossmaking public companies
are being privatised
Well its understandable if it is lossmaking
But take the example of ONGC
In Financial Year 202122
It recorded a Net Profit of 400 billion
It became Indias secondmost profitable company after Reliance Industries
Even so the government directed ONGC
to privatise oil and gas fields
Anyway this is a major issue on its own right
For now lets stick to the privatisation of the airports
in November 2018 a committee was formed
Public Private Partnership Appraisal Committee
This committee was tasked with deciding the criteria
To whom the airports should be given after the privatisation
This committee made 2 decisions
First any company purchasing these airports
Need not have any previous experience in this field
And second there is no restriction on
The number of airports one company could bid for
After this all 6 airports went to Adani
Adani companies had no previous experience managing an airport
Friends it is now reported that when this happened
The Finance Ministry and NITI Aayog had raised concerns against this
They said that this would be a big financial risk
To handover the airports to a bidder
With no previous experience in handling airports
could cause performance issues
The quality of services could be compromised
But these objections were overruled
And Adani got 6 airports
In the same category as this alleged Airport Scam
is another alleged scam
The hijacking of the Mumbai Airport
I am not making up these allegations
These allegations were raised by opposition leaders in Parliament
The only reason you dont know about these in detail
is because the media doesnt discuss these
Mumbai airport was under the control of GVK Group
On 28th July 2020
The Enforcement Directorate raided
the Mumbai and Hyderabad offices of the GVK Group
Additionally the office of Mumbai International Airport Limited was raided
It was a joint venture managing the airport
About 1 month after this raid
On 1st September 2020
Adani Group acquired a 74 stake
of Mumbai International Airport
Of this 74 stake 505 stake
was previously held by the GVK Group
that is completely held by Adani now
The question arose if this was a coincidence or collusion
GVK was pressured by
the Indian Government
to hand over the airport to Mr Adani
In December 2021
Minister of State for Civil Aviation General V K Singh
Told the Rajya Sabha that
of the total 8 airports under publicprivate partnership
7 airports are run by Adani Enterprises
In March 2022
SBI underwrites the debt owed by Adanis Navi Mumbai airport
The debt of 12770 billion
You would ask about the meaning of underwriting
So come look at the dictionary definition of it
It means that the banks provide financial support
and take responsibility
of bearing the cost if the company fails
This could be considered a Golden Offer
The 4th allegation here
was the alleged Coal Scam
Opposition leaders have alleged that
when Prime Minister Modi goes on a tour of foreign countries
he doesnt work for Indias benefit
He works for Adanis benefit
He travels with you on your delegations
He meets heads of states on visits to India
He portrays that India is the Prime Minister
And the Prime Minister is him
He makes it appear to the world that
he is the remote control behind the Prime Minister
And by obliging him well be obliging the Prime Minister
Interestingly such allegations arent raised by opposition leaders only
Instead some BJP leaders are doing the same
BJP leader Subramanian Swamy
shared a chronology
Our research team verified whether these news articles were correct
Theyre correct
Listen to the chronology
December 2021
Adani Group started exporting coals from its Australian coal mines
Climate activists had protested against this coal mines previously
May 2022
the Indian government slashes the import duty on coal
From 25 to 0
June 2022
the Modi government directed Coal India
to be prepared for importing 12 million tonnes of coal
NTPC awards coal import tenders of 83 billion
to Adani Enterprises
Coincidence? or Collusion?
Subramanian Swamy missed 2 imported reports
May 2022 in India power plants were allowed
the use of blended coal
that contains 30 of imported coal
until March of next year
without the consent of the buyer states
On 26th May an emergency coal blending order was passed regarding this
under Section 11 of the Electricity Act
In July Congress leader Gaurav Vallabh
raised concern about this
Claiming that the government is working for the benefit of its friends
August 2022 this order was retracted
But in January 2023
the central government directed the power generation companies
to use the blend of imported coal
up to 6 of their requirement till September
In this story I missed out on a major point
Government officials had told the Indian Express
that the domestic coal procured from India
costs around 17002000 per tonne
But the coal imported by Adani
costs around 17000 to 20000 per tonne
Goes to show that when publicsector companies
are being directed to use imported coal
they have to pay ten times the costs
If you want to know about previously alleged scams in detail
such as the alleged 2G spectrum scam
commonwealth scam

Why are they known as scams?

Lets look at another chronology
related to Sri Lanka
May 2019
the governments of India Japan and Sri Lanka
signed a Memorandum of Cooperation
for the development of the East Container Terminal
At the Columbo Port
Quite commendable
February 2021
Sri Lanka cancels this ECT agreement from 2019
India and Japan werent happy with this
The next month March 2021
Sri Lanka changed the terminal
Instead of the East Container Terminal
the West Container Terminal
But then it says that it will be a joint publicprivate partnership project
Between the Sri Lanka Ports Authority
and Adani Ports and SEZ
In a press release the Sri Lankan government stated that
Their cabinetappointed negotiation committee
had requested the Indian High Commission
and the Japanese Embassy to nominate investors
Japan did not nominate any investor
While the Indian high commission gave approval to Adani ports and SEZ
This isnt the only foreign project which went to Adani
There are numerous such contracts
Related to ports defence electricity
In countries like Sri Lanka Bangladesh and Israel
That were awarded to Adani
TMC leader Mahua Moitra claims
That Adani travels with Prime Minister Modi
on his foreign tours
meets other heads of states
and has created an impression that
he is the remote control managing PM Modi
The next major accusation is of Tax Evasion
Look at this notice issued by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence
Dated 15th May 2014
Several such Show Cause Notices were issued to the Adani Group
Alleging that the Group evades paying taxes
They have not paid taxes properly
To the total amount of 10 billion approximately
There were allegations of using a shell company
And hundreds of millions of dollar were transferred among companies
And sent to tax havens
So that taxes could be avoided
But in August 2017 the adjudicating authority of DRI KVS Singh
Dropped all charges raised by this agency
The ones levied against Adani Power Maharashtra Limited
And Adani Power Rajasthan Limited
The allegations were that the goods imported by them
Were shown at an inflated value
They were talking about approx 39 billion
In February 2018 the Customs department claimed
That those orders were wrong illegal and improper
In 2017 the documents that were leaked to EPW indicate that
Adani Power did not pay the duty on Raw Materials and Consumables
Which amounted to approximately 10 billion
After this the next allegation is loanrelated
In September 2022 when Adanis wealth was at an alltime high
The loans owed by Adani Group touched alltime highs too
22 TRILLION!
On 30th January in an interview by Adani Groups CFO
To CNBC TV18
He stated that the total debt of the Adani Group is at 30 billion
Now 1 is around 82
So 1 billion is about 82 billion
So approximately this is around 248 trillion
Of this around 740 billion
approximately is owed to Indian Banks
From the disclosures made by banks we see that
Adani Group owes 400 billion to SBI
70 billion to PNB
Bank of Baroda declined to openly disclose the amount owed
But according to LiveMints report
It is calculated to be around 538 billion
These are national publicsector banks
And one company owes around 5238 billion to these banks
Another allegation related to the loans is of loan writeoff
The Indian Express filed an RTI in which they were told by RBI that
In the last 5 years the banks have written off about 10 trillion worth of loans
Writeoffs do not mean that the banks will stop trying to recover this money
But the banks have recovered only about 132 trillion of this money till now
That amounts to about only 13 of the writeoffs
In 2018 and 2021 BJP leader Subramanian Swamy accused the Adani Group
Of being an NPA trapeze artist
NPA refers to Bad Loans
Adani countered these allegations by claiming that
The Adani Group does not have any NPAs
The next accusation was regarding Shell Companies
Mahua Moitra talked about Mauritiusbased shell companies
His group companies have amassed nearly
42000 crores 420 billion in Foreign Portfolio Investments
From 6 Mauritiusbased funds
These funds have commonalities
Like common address common company secretary and common directors
She asked why this wasnt invested back in 2019
When she raised the issue in Parliament
Theres an urgent need to investigate these funds
I brought this up in this house in 2019
She mentioned another 40 shell companies
That invested in the Adani Group
She said that the funds were managed by Adanis brother
And a Chinese individual Chang ChungLing
DRI records reveal that
Chang ChungLing and Vinod Adani
Share the same residential address
Adani Group hasnt commented on this allegation
The list of accusations is very long friends
The allegations which I listed out now
Are far from over
If I start listing every allegation this will stretch into a 2hour long video
For now lets see what happened next
Opposition talked about this in Parliament
They demanded a JPC
To create a Join Parliamentary Committee to
conduct an investigation into the allegations
How did BJP respond to this?
BJP asked for proof
Proof for the allegations
I dont understand what proof do they need further?
These news articles on these allegations
Are publicly available
Was land not given to Adani at dirtcheap rates?
If this was indeed wrong why doesnt BJP reveal the rates at which the land was given to Adani?
And if there was no land allocation
Then BJP can say that no land was sold
Were rules changed for these 6 airports?
Was an order not passed to force power generators
to fulfil 10 of their need by imported coal?
Did they not purchase imported coal at 10 times the price of domestic coal?
If not then they can tell us the price it was procured at
What did Prime Minister Modi have to say in response to these allegations?
He asked why Rahul Gandhi doesnt use Nehrus surname
This was the actual response of Prime Minister Modi in Parliament
I still do not understand
why people from his lineage
Are afraid of using Nehru as their surname
The reason is that Rahul Gandhis surname
Is that of his grandfather
His grandfather Feroze Jahangir Gandhy
A freedom fighter
His surname was spelled Gandhy
During the freedom movement
He was very inspired by Mahatma Gandhi
Even before getting married to Indira Nehru
He had changed his surname to Gandhi
Replaced Y with an I
This is why Jawaharlal Nehrus daughters name
Changed from Indira Nehru to Indira Gandhi
And her sons grandsons granddaughters
Use the same surname
But I believe if it is becoming such an important issue
That it hinders investigation into alleged scams
I will request Rahul Gandhi
To please change his surname
To change his name to Rahul Nehru
So that there can be smooth investigations
What do you think friends?
Major allegations
Severe allegations
With documents to verify these allegations
But on the other hand there is no response
Let alone starting an investigation
There is no demand for an investigation
Media maintains its silence
And when someone tries to speak up on social media
They either run Adanis biography
Or the trend IStandWithAdani
Can you imagine this even happening before in Indias history?
In 1989 Bollywood stars Vinod Khanna Amjad Khan and Dimple Kapadia
were shooting for a film
This film was named Lekin
A dramamystery Bollywood film on ghosts
The story was about the spirit of a woman
being trapped in a palace looking for salvation
This film was being shot in a palace in Jaipur
One day on an otherwise normal day of shooting
after the shots were over people packed up
the sun had set night had fallen
and Dimple Kapadia was snug in her bed
She says that she saw a woman sitting beside her on the bed
She talked to the woman
and she had this eerie feeling that the woman was a ghost
This is just one example
But you will find hundreds of thousands of examples all over the world
where people claim to have seen ghosts and spirits
and even talked to them
Many people report that they went through paranormal experiences
So many films have been made on this
The Conjuring The Exorcist
The Exorcism of Emily Rose
These films claim to have been inspired from real events
There have been so many TV shows
Ghosthunters where people equipped with sophisticated instruments
go on a hunt to catch ghosts
They use technology to prove that ghosts exist
And some people make YouTube videos of talking to the spirits of dead people
Such as American paranormal expert Steve Huff
he claims to have talked to the spirit of the Late Sushant Singh Rajput
Whats the truth behind all this?
Come in todays video lets try to understand this
This is the live testimony of Sushants spirit
School for Ghosts
Do ghosts and spirits really exist?
There are places that are still feared by people
Its said that this place is haunted by ghosts at night
It is truly extraordinary unimaginable unbelievable
First of all lets keep aside the events that have an obvious reason
Such as the famous case of the Fox Sisters
In the 1800s in America
three sisters were very famous among the spiritual people
These three sisters were known as the Fox Sisters
And people claimed that from a very young age
these three sisters could communicate with ghosts and spirits
When people wanted to communicate with someones spirit
theyd go to these sisters
These sisters would ask questions to the spirits
and in response they could hear the walls of their room banging
Sometimes they would see messages on blank cards
Their spirittalking sessions
where they talked to the spirits
were very popular in America back then
These three sisters raked in a lot of money from this
But one day the husband of one of the sisters died
He was an orthodox Christian and believed these things
He told his wife to stop doing such things
to stop communicating with spirits
After the death of her husband the sister went into depression
She started drinking
And had a falling out with the other two sisters
One day this sister publicly confessed
that the three sisters were conning people for a long time
They didnt talk to ghosts and spirits
they were simply playing small tricks
Such as tying an object with a string and making it fall unnaturally
Sometimes hitting the walls with their feet to make the banging sounds
This sister claimed that people were so emotional
that people were willing to accept the delusion
people would even feel the spirits touching them
Another famous story is of the Amityville Haunted House
In New York there was a house called Amityville
a person named Ronny had murdered his family there
When this person was presented in court
he claimed that he could hear voices in the house
And that he committed the murders under the influence of the ghostly noises
After this another family moved into this house
The family of George and Kathy
They claimed to have heard these noises too
They started seeing ghosts
They witnessed paranormal activities in this house
and finally they had to leave the house
What was the mystery of this story?
Later news reports by ABC News showed that
they were lying
The murderer had lied to save himself from the punishment
And the couple that moved in later
lied because they thought that
they could earn some good bucks by lying
They assumed that they would get book deals and film deals
In India a recent example was seen
when a person named Steve Huff claimed
that he was communicating with the spirit of the late Sushant Singh Rajput
He recorded his conversation while talking to the spirit
and posted it on YouTube
And because many people were already emotional about this issue
They were misled
Several news channels reported on this as well
India TV Amar Ujala TV
DNA News24
as if what was shown in this video was real
But what had happened here actually?
As revealed by an Instagram user
this person took some clips from an old interview
where he was interviewed by film critic Anupama Chopra some years ago
audio clips were extracted from there
those audio clips were then manipulated
and played as if it was Sushant Singh Rajputs spirit talking
And surprisingly friends hardly did any news channel
run this news where the truth was exposed
Because you get TRP by appeasing the superstitious beliefs of people
They wouldnt get TRP by talking about science and logical things
So lets keep aside such fraudsters and false cases
where the lies were clearly evident
But what about the cases where people do not lie?
What about the films that are inspired by reallife incidents?
In 2017 there was a film called Veronica
In it it was shown that during a solar eclipse
Veronica and her friends go to the school basement
and use an Ouija board
to contact Veronicas dead father and her dead boyfriend
This ritual was interrupted by a nun
then the Ouija board breaks
and a demon possesses Veronica
She gets possessed
Interestingly this film claims that
it was inspired by real events
So did this happen in reality?
The real story is of a girl named Estefania
This reallife case drew so much attention
that even in the police report it was mentioned
that there were some paranormal activities at this girls house
If you watch such films
you might also feel that
since it is shown in so many films there would be some truth to it
Some elements of it would be true at least
It cant be that all of it is false
Especially when they write that the film is inspired by real events
But friends the point here is that people misunderstand the word inspired
Saying that it is based on true events
and inspired by true events are different
When the director of this film was asked questions about it
he had clearly said that
This is why the real story and the story depicted in the film
have vast differences
In reality according to the news reports
the parents of the girl were alive
In the film its shown that the girl dies within 3 days
but in reality the girl Estefania died several months later
after suffering from seizures
Third in the real story it cannot be ruled out
that Estefania suffered from a psychotic disorder
A disorder that went undiagnosed by a doctor
because they lived in a rural area
During the 1990s
Back then technology and medical science werent as advanced as they are now
And finally after Estefanias death
her parents had claimed to have witnessed paranormal activities around them
That they could hear their daughter scream
But when her mother was psychologically examined
it was revealed that she was suffering from emotional instability
anxiety and need for attention
I am going into the detail of this case
because we often come across such cases
This is a typical example of the cases that inspire horror films
Youd say that even if we suppose one family member had a psychological illness
but if the entire family behaves in such a manner
and claim to have witnessed paranormal activity
what would happen in that case?
Friends in such cases there is a phenomenon known as
Mass Psychogenic Illness
Also known as Shared Psychotic Disorder
We saw this in the famous Burari Case
which saw the mass suicide by 11 family members
It was a famous case from Delhi
I talked about this in the video on Monkeyman as well
The secret behind the mystery of the Monkeyman
Ill put the link to that video in the description
you can go watch it later
Another bizarre case was seen in an Australian family
where the family of 5 went on a road trip
and suddenly they suffered from paranoia
that someone was trying to kill them
Eventually the family members separated from each other and disappeared
Though they united later
this is said to be a case of Shared Delusional Disorder SDD
where people who are close to each other
often reinforce each others delusions
But if you are still interested in horror stories for entertainment
then Id recommend that you listen to horror stories on KUKU FM
They have horror audiobooks such as Bargad ka Ped
It is wellwritten and thrilling
If you dont know KUKU FM it is a brilliant audio learning platform

Normally it costs 399 for the whole year
but if you use the coupon code DHRUV50
you will get 50 off
It means that it will cost you only 199 for the entire year
You can go try it out
But now lets talk about stranger phenomenons
Things that will shock you when you find out how these work exactly
First are these Ouija boards
They are spelled OUIJA
but its pronounced weeje
You would have seen them in numerous films
Exorcist Paranormal Activity Conjuring 2
Even in Indian films such as A Death in the Goonj
even in a web series on Zee5
It is basically said to be a medium to communicate with ghosts
There are alphabets and numbers written on this board
along with yes and no
And there is a triangular pointer known as Planchet
To use this people go to a dark place
light some candles close their eyes
and request the spirits to come to them
In case a spirit is around them they call it to communicate with them
Then the people place their hands on this pointer
And ask questions to the spirits
If the spirit wants to answer with a yes or no
then their hands on the triangular pointer start moving toward the answer
Friends it is interesting to note that
people do not move their hands on their own
Some people may be those that are just having fun with it
but there are many people who use the Ouija boards
but do not move their hands on their own
Their hands start moving on their own
Spirits can you speak to us?
Are you there?
And they believe that the spirits control their hands making them move
And that they are communicating with the spirits
How can this be possible?
There is a scientific phenomenon to this
Ideomotor Effect
Ideomotor Effect is a psychological phenomenon
where we move our bodies unconsciously
Without our conscious self being aware of it
For example our hand starts moving but we dont even know it
Often you would notice that when you go to sleep
moments before you fall asleep
you feel that youre falling
You slipped and now youre falling
And then youre jerked awake
This is known as the Hypnic Jerk
Your body moves unconsciously
It thinks that it is falling from somewhere
And that causes the jerk
A hypnic jerk is different from the Ideomotor effect
But they are similar
The difference is that you experience a hypnic jerk
when you are about to fall asleep
But you can witness the ideomotor effect while youre awake
If your hand is moving on its own on the Ouija board
this is an example of an ideomotor effect
Your brain signals your body to move in that way
but your consciousness doesnt even know this
If you want an example of this
you can experience this right now wherever you are
Take a pendulum
If you dont have that take a light weight and attach it to a string
It can be your button or your ring
tie it to a string
Since I have none of this let me use this charger for this example
This works like a pendulum now
Its oscillating already
What you need to do is
place your hand in front of yourself
And this weight is normally oscillating
Think to yourself that you need to make it move in a clockwise direction
Move it in the clockwise direction
And eventually youll see that it starts moving in the same direction on its own
This isnt working quite as well with a charger
because it isnt as thin as a string
But you can see the movement here
And now if you want to make it move in the anticlockwise direction
It starts moving anticlockwise without you needing to do anything
you arent moving it consciously
But since your brain wants to make it move anticlockwise
you can see it moving in that direction
Try it out for yourself
People who really believe in Ouija boards
who believe that they are really talking to spirits
their brain creates subconscious images and memories
of the person the spirit that has passed on
When they ask questions their brain uses those memories and images to respond
and their brain subconsciously tells their body to move
There have been several scientific studies into this
Theres a simple Blindfold Test for this
If a spirit was the one to move that planchet
even when people are blindfolded
when people have their eyes closed
the planchet should move in the correct way
But what happens actually instead of moving in the right way
the pointer gives absurd responses
If people do not know where Yes or No is
they start pointing the pointer randomly
We see the same ideomotor effect on people who claim that they are possessed
That theres a spirit in them
Not every case is a lie
if they think that they are possessed and start behaving so
it is actually possible that their body is making the movements unconsciously
without them being aware of it
Thats why they might think that they are possessed
Since their body starts moving without their control
It is the act of the subconscious mind
Similarly some people claim that they are gifted with automatic writing
That they can communicate with spirits
who make their hands move to write things
Its the same thing
Most of the people who make such claims are obviously lying
But the ones that are telling the truth
are victims of this ideomotor effect
But lets keep the ideomotor effect to a side
what about the ghosthunters that carry sophisticated equipment to catch ghosts
Lets analyse that as well
Often the cameras used by the ghosthunters is an infrared cameras
Which captures thermal patterns
They capture the spirits with these cameras
which makes it seem like a negative photograph
In reality friends whenever there is a change in temperature
you can see it quite clearly through an infrared camera
Think about it if you sit on a chair and
rub your back on the back of the chair
it will generate some heat
If you get up and see the chair with an infrared camera
it will seem like someone is sitting on the chair
When in reality the chair has some heat residue
Another interesting example is if you come out of the bathroom with wet feet
if you walk on the floor and look at it through an infrared camera
it will look like the footprints of a spirit
Because the temperature of your feet would be different than the rest of your body
Look at this interesting video explaining it in detail
Perhaps you are sitting around the dining room table having a sance
Calling on spirits from the past
when a pattern you might catch could be
someone that was sitting on a chair perhaps
Another thought that came to mind
maybe it was a crew member from one of those shows
leaning up against the wall
In this shot here my thermal reflection
as I walk across a wood floor in a home
could be mistaken for something else
In addition to this these ghost hunters carry an EMF meter with them
the EMF meter is an interesting thing
If you have a cell phone or twoway radio around you
or any kind of electronic device really
which emits electromagnetic waves
this meter would show a reading
from a computer mouse to a camera battery pack
anything can make this meter fluctuate all over the place
They use motion sensor lights often
Even if a mouse is passing through an abandoned building
it will turn on the motion sensor
and they will use it to claim that they spotted a spirit
By using these technical devices the nonsense thats often sprout
is presented on the TV as if they have really spotted ghosts
It is done in America as well as India
In many countries in fact
Theres a TV show in Aaj Tak Adhbut
Supernatural Unimaginable Unbelievable
They show some VFX with some background horror music
and the anchor Sweta Singh presents ghosts and spirits to people
Ages pass by but some questions remain unanswered
If these people can find a nanochip in the 2000 currency note
they can find spirits as well
But what can they do?
Showing ghosts on TV attracts TRP
Showing ghosts in cinemas earns them some nice box office collections
And now even YouTubers have started showing stories of ghosts
Actually it isnt wrong to do these
As long as these are presented solely as entertainment
I enjoy watching horror films
They give a different kind of thrill
The fear that it brings is quite enjoyable
But if a TV show film or a YouTuber claims that
they have definitely spotted a ghost
And that ghosts and spirits are real
it is complete nonsense
It is nice to entertain people
But to make false promises to people and to fool them
by encouraging superstition
is absolutely wrong
But what about the Dimple Kapadia case
that I mentioned at the beginning of this video?
Friends the thing is that in the film Lekin
Dimple was playing the role herself
The role of the ghost
Her character was based on it
When she experienced the ghost encounter
She went and told this to Padmini Devi the erstwhile princess
She replied that Dimple had been shooting the entire day as a ghost
so it wasnt out of the ordinary that it was stuck on her mind
which then caused the delusion
I said Listen Dimps the thing is
that you are shooting all day as a ghost
So therefore at night Im sure you woke up
and you thought that there was somebody else with you
Keep your wits about you when it comes to such things

6th January 2004
Dubais sandy soil started being dug
to build the tallest building in the world
Around the end of 2004
worlds tallest building was Taipei 101
Located in Taiwan this building was a little over 500m tall
But the goal they set out to achieve in Dubai
was unimaginable and recordbreaking
They wanted a building so tall
that not only would it be the tallest building in the world
but also be 62 taller than the secondtallest building
The difference between the tallest and second tallest
would discourage anyone attempting to break its record
Before Burj Khalifa the previous worlds tallest buildings
were about 510 taller than their predecessor
At most 19 taller
But here they were aiming to build it 829m tall
A difference of 62
It took about 55 years to construct this building
and on 1st October 2009
the construction of the Burj al Khalifa ended
and this building left the world astounded
After the success of Burj Khalifa several countries announced that
theyll build even taller buildings
Many attempted it
But till now all plans have flopped
It has been more than 13 years
and till now the record set by Burj Khalifa remains unbeaten
Why is it so difficult to beat this record?
And practically speaking
how tall can the buildings built by humans be?
Come in this video lets try to understand this
When the Burj in Dubai is complete
it will be the tallest structure
that mankind has ever built on the face of the planet
Until someone builds an even bigger one
This is the story of the tallest tower
mankind has ever built
Hald a mile high
Friends for about 4000 years
the tallest structure built by humans was
It was built around 2500 BC
as a tomb for the Pharaoh Khufu
Its height is 145m
This record was broken only after the 1300s
when a cathedral was built in England
that was 160m tall
For the next 500 years this record was beaten by a series of churches
until the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889
But then Eiffel Tower isnt precisely a building
Its not a building in which people can stay or work in
In terms of proper buildings
this building by Chicago Home Insurance built in 1884
is known as the worlds first skyscraper
This was a building built for humans
Where people went to work it was used as an office space
Before this the previous tall structures
were either built for monarchs or for Gods
This was a major turning point in human history
Though this building was only 55m tall
Shorter than the Great Pyramid of Giza
But only after this did we get the innovation and technology
that we could build habitable skyscrapers
When the competition to build tall buildings began
it was limited to New York and Chicago
Because America was the worlds largest and most productive economy
till the end of the 19th century
And these 2 cities were central to the most economic boom
Many people wanted to live in these cities
Big companies wanted big office spaces
and to accommodate people better in the city
these skyscrapers had to be built
Some honourable mentions here
New Yorks Empire State Building
It remained the worlds tallest building from 1931 to 1971
It held the record for 40 years
And in the modern context
it held the record for the longest time
It was beaten in 1971
by another building in New York
the World Trade Centre at 417m
9 taller than Empire State Buildings 381m
In 1998 the competition spread out of America
and shifted towards Asia
When the Petronas Towers were built in Kuala Lumpur
at the height of 452m
They held the status of the worlds tallest building till 2004
after which it was beaten by Taipei 101
And in 2009 with the biggest margin
Burj Khalifa beat all of them
From 510m to 829m
Initially when Burj Khalifa was being planned
its initial proposed height was around 550m
During planning they kept on increasing the height until it was as tall as we know
At that time the brief of the tower was to
design a tower which was 550m
Which was then slightly taller
than the world record holder at that time
which was Taipei 101
We learned as we got into the project
that we could go higher
And there was a desire to go higher
And not only break the record by a little bit
but we could break it by a big margin
The reason was that in the downtown area of Dubai
this building would be the centrepiece attraction
Before the 1990s Dubai was basically
a village for fishing and pearl diving
That had discovered oil recently
But by the late 1990s and the early 2000s
the leaders in Dubai wanted
to diversify their economy
To move beyond the dependence on oil
They wanted to make Dubai an international tourism hub
To grab international attention and  to bring foreign investment
they had to do something to surprise the world
Friends Burj Khalifa is so tall
that if you jump out from its top
it will take you 13 seconds to fall to the ground
Without any air resistance
But if you account for the air resistance
then to fall to the ground from the very top
it might take you up to 20 seconds
Burj Khalifa is so tall that if you
watch the sunset from the ground
and then take the lift to its top
you can watch the sunset again
It cost 15 billion to build this
With more than 12000 workers
with more than 100 distinct nationalities
and spend 22 million manhours
But obviously the purpose of building it
turned out to be quite successful
Today not only has Dubai become an international hub for tourism
but also an economic hub
A large number of companies want to have their office in Dubai
People were to live in Dubai
Want to buy property there
And the downtown area where this Burj Khalifa was built
property prices have skyrocketed so much
that this 15 billion was easily recovered
The question arises what is so special about the Burj Khalifa
that makes it so difficult to beat it?
And if someone tries to build a taller building
realistically how tall can we build?
To understand this we need to first understand
the problems that are encountered while building such tall buildings
When such a tall building is built
it needs to support its weight
At those heights the winds are quite strong
so it needs to be ensured that theres no damage due to the winds
And the Burj Khalifa overcame these challenges
due to its innovative design
If you look at the design from the top
its in a Y shape
Similar to a tripod this building has three wings
Supported by a hexagonal core at the centre of the building
This structural system is known as the Buttressed Core
This was invented by Burj Khalifas structural engineer Bill Baker
This structural system was used for the first time
in South Koreas Tower Palace 3
With the height of 264m
After its success the architects realised that
using this system can help build taller buildings
And only with its help
Burj Khalifa could be so tall
So tall that the secondtallest building was 300m shorter
And Burj Khalifa was only the second building in the world
to use this Buttressed core system
With the help of this system
the impact of the strong winds that blow can be reduced
Compare this to the new residential building in New York
that have been built very tall
and fall under the category of Super Tall
but without using the Buttressed Core system
What needs to be done in those buildings?
To be safe from the winds a few floors must be left empty
So that the winds could pass through
Such as this 432 Park Avenue building
Apart from this Burj Khalifas foundation
has 192 concrete and steel columns under it
They extend to 50m into the ground
Similarly the building above ground needed concrete too
Concrete had to be delivered to the very top
To do this the worlds largest concrete pumps were built
so that Burj Khalifa could be built
The exterior of the building uses more than 100000m glass
as you can see in the photos
But an even more surprising fact is that
the exterior of the Burj Khalifa
forms the worlds largest LED screen
Thats right!
Worlds Biggest LED Screen
This is why you can watch light shows on Burj Khalifa
You can see colourful designs and patterns
and even movie trailers
Recently before the release of the film Pathaan
Shah Rukh Khan was in front of the Burj Khalifa
when the trailer of Pathaan was being shown on Burj Khalifa
The entire movie trailer being shown on a building
You might think that this is a projection
That the trailer was being projected onto the building by a projector
It wasnt
There are LED lights on the building
Such as the tiny LED lights on your computer screens and TV
There are 12 million LED lights on this building in total
From up close the LED lights look like this
Each light is quite large
But if you see these 12 million LED lights from afar
itll feel as if you are watching a TV screen
It enables videos of any length to be played on this building
And you might be wondering that when videos are being played
wont it create problems for the people inside the Burj Khalifa?
Wouldnt they see films playing on the windows or these lights?
No they wont
Next time when you visit the Burj Khalifa during the light show
look closely and youll notice that these lights
arent spread out all over the building
They are installed only on the frames
This is sufficient to display videos that  can be enjoyed by an audience at a distance
Friends buildings this tall have another problem
Suppose you are on the 160th floor of the Burj Khalifa
and a fire breaks out in the building
Will you climb down the stairs for 160 floors?
For such scenarios
in cases of emergency
after every 25 floors
there are pressurised and airconditioned refuge areas
Additionally staircases have been built with fireproof concrete
to limit the spread of fire
Friends now lets see the buildings that can
be taller than the Burj Khalifa in future
Here it is interesting to note that
over the last 12 years
even though no building could beat the Burj Khalifa
of the 20 tallest buildings currently
17 have been built after the Burj Khalifa
Such as the Merdeka 118 at 679m
Under construction in Kuala Lumpur
It will be officially inaugurated in mid2023
But it has already become the secondtallest building in the world
Though its a commendable effort
but 679m is still far from 829m
But several buildings have been planned
to be taller than the Burj Khalifa
Of which at least 2 of the buildings
are already under construction
The first is the Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia
If it is constructed as planned
it will be the first building to exceed the height of 1km
Its design is quite similar to the Burj Khalifa
because both buildings have the same architect
Once again Adrian Smith followed the Yshaped design
to bring in structural integrity
Once again the purpose for building this
is to diversify Saudi Arabias economy
so that it doesnt need to rely on oil only
Similar to the Burj Khalifa
this building would be used to build a new district
Jeddah Economic City
The construction of this building began in 2013
And about 14th of the tower was constructed
but unfortunately
in early 2018 the construction was halted
Since then the construction hasnt restarted
The thing is between 20172019
there was an anticorruption purge in Saudi Arabia
and the major investors investing in this project were arrested
And then the Covid19 pandemic hit
And the delay still continues
Publicly no one knows when the construction will restart
but if it is restarted this is the only building that can break Burj Khalifas record
The second project that has a high potential
is in Dubai
the Dubai Creek Tower
This Creek Tower designed by a Spanish architect
will be an observation tower in Dubai
It was planned around 20162018
and the foundation has been laid already
but the construction is stopped here as well
Originally it was planned to be inaugurated during the 2020 Expo
but it couldnt happen
The exact height of this tower
has not been revealed yet
but it is believed to be between 838m1300m
This tower may beat the Jeddah Tower in terms of height
but this tower will not fit into the tallest building category
Because as per the plans there will be no residential or commercial spaces here
This is being planned as a simple observation deck
Such as the Eiffel Tower
But the construction is halted here as well
And we do not know when and if it will restart
So if not these two which buildings
can beat the Burj Khalifa in future?
This question takes an imaginary turn here
Because the rest of the planned projects
have been planned and announced
but work on them hasnt started yet
Such as the Mubarak AlKabir Tower planned in Kuwait
Proposed in 2007
it was supposed to be 1001m tall
Its overall design was quite similar to that of the Burj Khalifa
but construction has not begun on it
So no one can estimate when it will be built
It is only a proposed plan now
If this sounds like an amazing plan
an even more astounding plan is
the Sky Mile Tower in Tokyo
A 17km tall building
For 500000 people to live
Look at the photos of this proposed building
Its overall shape is similar to Burj Khalifas
But if such a tall tower has to be built
it will be very challenging to control the winds
This is why there are these big gaps in the proposed design
so that the winds can flow through the building
These are proper vertical slots
and this project is included in a visionary megacity project
Known as the Next Tokyo
The Japanese government will try to build a Next Tokyo near Tokyo
Till now the plan is entirely theoretical
construction hasnt begun
But if it does begin it is estimated that
it will be completed by 2045
Overall theres little chance that even in the next 25 years there will be a building
that can beat the design of Burj Khalifa
The innovative design that made it possible for Burj Khalifa to be so tall
Even in the past 10 years
there were several projects for buildings taller than 800m
that were planned and then later cancelled
Such as in 2012 in Azerbaijan
a 1km tall building was planned
It was later cancelled
In 2013 China planned to build an 838m tall Sky City Scraper
due to environmental concerns this didnt receive government approval
this project was cancelled in 2016
The plans beyond Tokyos Sky Mile Tower
plans for taller buildings
are so imaginary that they belong to the sciencefiction category
Such as the plan for Tokyos XSeed 4000 building
A visionary project of building such a tall structure in Tokyo
A 4km tall building
Taller than Mount Fuji
With 1 million people living in it
It will look like this
Like a mountain
This was planned in 1995
but this is only a plan no work has been done on this
Another such plan is to build a Space Elevator
A cabled structured so tall that
it will take you to space
to ease transport between Earth and space
This is a theoretical concept that can be discussed in a separate video
and even so it wont fit into the building category
So theres no use discussing this in this video
The question remains practically
how tall can we build?
The structural engineer of Burj Khalifa Bill Baker claims
that if we use a modified version of the Buttressed Core
we can possibly build a building with a height of more than 2 miles
He says its possible to build a building taller than 3 km
He even claims that theoretically we can build a building taller than Mount Everest
But practically the problem would be
the taller the building gets
the more weight you put on the floors at the bottom
The force on the lower levels of the building
and the force of the strong winds at the top of the building
will be the two major challenges in building the tallest building possible
We can definitely use innovative design engineering and construction techniques
but what will happen if your material gives up?
As of now the materials that we know of
such as concrete steel aluminium
all have a limit
If we want to exceed these limits
we will need to invent such materials
that are lighter and more durable than these
A promising material that is said to be
is Carbon Fibre
Lightweight fibres made of carbon
woven like a mesh
It is stronger and lighter than steel
and perhaps it will enable us to build taller buildings
But before these complex engineering problems
there will be the problem of the human body
As buildings cross the mark of 15km3km
the altitude will be so high
that there will be differences in the air pressure
If youve gone to Leh Ladakh you wouldve noticed
how for the first couple of days there you suffer nausea and dizziness
because your body needs to acclimatise
due to the lower oxygen levels at the height
When you climb a mountain this can happen slowly
but if we built such a tall building
thats 2 km tall
when you take the elevator to instantly go from the ground floor to the top
your body will face the same problems unless
the air pressure is controlled inside the building
First of all this will be extremely expensive
and secondly it will mean that
balconies cannot be constructed on higher floors
And even if you made them no one would be allowed to go there
These things will need to be kept in mind
And even before the human bodys problems
is the socioeconomic limitaions
The biggest problem why such buildings arent built
Theres no guarantee that each building will be as successful as Burj Khalifa
that there will be such levels of economic boom around it
Investors will need to spend thousands of millions
to fund such buildings
Funding such buildings would mean extremely high risks
How many people would want to fund it?
Additionally this will require the support of the local government
but many governments will not support these
Because in most countries funds could be better utilised
In developing countries like India
if the government invests all its funds in such projects
to build the tallest building possible
it will be a huge wastage
This is why even in China
recently the Chinese government passed a law that
that they will not allow any building to be built taller than 500m
Any building being built taller than that would be simply for vanity
Practically it is a wastage of money
The energy consumption of such a building would be very high
and public funds will be wasted
And since there was no need they banned it
According to the laws of the Chinese government
in cities with up to 3 million people
the height limit for the skyscrapers has been set at 250m
Friends it is really important to pay attention to one thing here
there are very few cities all around the world
where the socioeconomic factors would allow
the worlds tallest building being built there
About 100 years ago these cities were New York and Chicago
That witnessed an economic boom
Hordes of people were moving in
There was a demand to build more homes and offices in a limited space
and so skyscrapers were born there
In the 21st century this was seen to some extent in Chinese and Taiwanese cities
thats why you see so many skyscrapers in those cities
but they arent so tall that they couldnt be profitable
And then there were the Middle Eastern countries
such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia
where the government wants to reduce oil dependence
and the government has a lot of money from oil
So it was possible to do this in such places to a large extent
Friends this is the reason why for now and for the foreseeable future at least
Burj Khalifa will remain the Worlds Tallest Building

And Ill see you in the next video friends
26th April 1986 at 123 AM
the Reactor Number 4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Soviet Union
The lid on top of the reactor starts shaking
And the shockwaves are felt all throughout the building
The workers present realised that
the nuclear reaction in the reactor
was completely out of control by then
And that reactor had to be stopped quickly
So one of those workers acted fast
and pressed the Emergency Shut Down button
By pressing the button the control rods were designed to enter the reactors
and prevent the reactions
But they didnt work as designed
After the button was pressed the control rods entered the reactor
but as soon as they went in there was a huge blast
A huge explosion
After this blast the reactor was engulfed in flames
The harmful radioactive material present there
rose up into the air with the flames
The amount of harmful radioactive material released in this disaster
was equal to 400 Hiroshima atomic bomb
This disaster is still considered to be the Worlds Worst Nuclear Disaster
The radiation spreading through the air
had an effect on not only Ukraine but all over Europre from Spain to Sweden also
There was radioactive rain in the United Kingdom
The radioactive dust which settled on the grass in the hills
were consumed by cows
and the amount of radiation in the milk of those cows spiked
Due to this thousands of children got Thyroid Cancer
Come in this video
lets understand why this Chernobyl disaster took place
The reasons behind it
and the effects that were seen all over the world
In a nuclear accident near the Soviet Union
once Reactor 4 the scene of a total meltdown
The explosion at a nuclear plant in the Soviet Union
Near the reactor at Ukraines Chernobyl Power Plant
the ecplosions powerful enough to blow up the steel and concrete lid
Friends after World War II
the Sovient Union invested a lot of money in nuclear power plants
It built many nuclear power plants
on of which was the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant
Its official name was
It was built in the early 1970s
even though it is named the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant
it wasnt built in the city of Chernobyl
Chernobyl was a small city
approx 16 km away from this nuclear power plant
But friends this Chernobyl Plant
was among one of the most advanced
nuclear power plants in the Sovient Union
There were four nuclear reactors in this
in the RBMK 1000 design
RBMK 1000 is a type of nuclear reactor
The operations of the first 2 reactors had begun in 1977
the third in 1981
and the fourth in 1983
The purpose of power plants is to generate electricity
In this case each reactor could produce 1000 Megawatts electricity
The four reactors could together
supply electricity to meet 10 of Ukaraines electricity demand
So you can imagine how powerful these reactors were
Coming to the Chernobyl disaster
this disaster took place in the Reactor Number 4
during a routine safety test
To understand exactly what had happened that day
we first need to understand how a nuclear reactor works
In most of the methods of generating electricity
in the simplest terms you need a rotating wheel
You need movement for kinetic energy
In hydroelectricity when the water falls from above
it moves the wheels
and creates energy
In wind energy the wind moves the turbine
which produces energy once it starts rotating
In thermal powerplants
that uses coal to generate electricity
steam is released by buring the coals
and the steam later moves the wheels
The kinetic energy is thus generated
Even in case of nuclear energy
the wheel is moved by steam
But to make that steam water has to be heated up first
whereas in thermal energy coal heats up the water
in nuclear energy
the nuclear reactions taking place
heats up the water
Look at this diagram from a school book
You dont need to get into the details
you can see a turbine that is rotated by steam
And the steam is generated
because the nuclear reaction heats up the water
This water acts as a coolant as well
To prevent overheating around the reactor
the constant supply of water is a must
In the Chernobyl plant the water came from a nearby manmade water reserve
There was a river beside it too
It is important to have a consistent supply of water at all times
For this the water pumps pushing the water into the pipes
should be working nonstop
But what happens in case of a power cut?
To ensure that the water pumps keep working at all times
There were some backup diesel generators in the Chernobyl plant
So that they could provide uninterrupted electricity to the pumps
But to start these generators
it took about 1 or 2 minutes
Within those 12 minutes
there was a need for an additional power source to ensure that the water pumps keep working
The builders of Chernobyl reactor had said that
the electricity needed for these crucial 12 minutes
could be sourced from the nuclear reactor itself
Since the turbines would be moving because of the steam
and even after a reactor shutdown there would be some amount of steam
that would last for a couple of minutes
would be enough to power those plants
So friends in the wee hours of 26 April
they were testing this
If there was a power cut
would the turbines be able to produce enough electricity
to power the water pumps?
Tihs test was run earlier as well
but this test was never successful in reactor number 4
The workers hoped that the test would be successful that illfated night
One day before this on 25th April
they had tried to conduct a test but it couldnt be carried out
And so the test was delayed by a day
The workers working in this plant
didnt even get full sleep
At 1110 PM on 25th April
they began the preparations for this test
To understand the rest of the story
we need to understand the science of reactors for a bit
The process of the nuclear reaction in the nuclear reactor
The core of the nuclear reactors the main part
is mainly built of three things
Fure rods are basically nuclear fuel
which causes the nuclear reactions
In this case Uranium Dioxide
enriched with Uranium 235 Isotope
We know that an atom is built of electrons protons and neutrons
and each element has a different number of electrons protons and neutrons
Several elements have isotopes as well
Isotopes are basically a type of variations in the elements
Take the element Uranium
which has three isotopes
Uranium238 Uranium235 and Uranium234
In different isotopes
the number of protons remains the same
but they have different number of neutrons
But there are some rare isotopes
of some elements
that can undergo the nuclear fission reactions
Uranium235 is an isotope of Uranium
which permits nuclear fission reaction
and create nuclear energy
This Uranium isotope is unstable
due to which it falls apart and released radiations
This keeps on disintegrating on its own
but it can also be broken apart if a neutron collides with it
Both cases are known as a nuclear fission reaction
In this process one atom of this element splits into two
and a few extra lonesome neutrons are formed
Additionally it releases kinetic energy as well
that converts into thermal energy
which later goes on to move the turbine
But the extra neutrons that are realeased
go and collide with more atoms
and such disintegration continues
and just like that a chain reaction begins
It is known as Nuclear Chain Reaction
To slow down this reaction
Control rods are used
In this case the control rods were made of Boron Carbide
Boron is an element which
absorbs neutrons quite well
The extra neutrons formed as a result of the nuclear fission reaction
get absorbed by Boron
and do not collide with the other atoms
and the speed of the nuclear fission reaction slows down
In the core of a nuclear reactor
when the fuel rods are inserted
the control rods are inserted beside it
to control the nuclear reaction
The more the control rods are inserted
the reaction will be proportionately slowed down
Apart from this the third thing that I told you about the Moderator
In this case graphite blocks were the moderators
These help to speed up the reaction
Graphite slows down the energy of the neutrons
increasing the chances of neutrons colliding more with Uranium atoms
Thus increasing the speed of the reaction
Today most of the nuclear plants
water is used as moderator
But in the RBMK 1000 reactors used in Chernobyl back then
graphite was used as Moderator
To summarised the science of it
imagine a car on a road
If you hit the gas pedal the speed of the car will increase
And if you hit the brakes it will slow down and eventually stop
In case of the nuclear reactor the car moving on the road
is the fuel rods of Uranium where the reaction takes place
The gas pedal works are the Moderator
The deeper you insert it the reaction would be sped up
and the control rods act as the brakes
when you hit the brakes itll slow down the reaction
The after effect of the Chernobyl disaster
was worse that that caused by the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
Today you can see the live examples of it
The disaster zone of Chernobyl
is so dangerous that people cannot go there
It is a restricted area
But the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
are populated by so many people
on that illfated night 26th April
the workers were testing the unit
Workers were tasked with
reducing the output of the nuclear power plant from 1600 MW of electricity to 700 MW
But as soon as the workers inserted the control rods
the power dropped even more
It fell below their expectations
And reached 30 MW
The workers working there couldnt comprehend why it happened
The reason for this was that in this nuclear fission reaction
a byproduct was created
Xenon 135
Similar to Boron Xenon 135 could absorb the neutrons quite efficiently
Because this byproduct was being created in this reaction
it was absorbing the excess neutrons
and the brakes were being hit quite hard
Thats why the electricity produced was lower than expected
Normally when Xenon is produced in a nuclear reaction
it burns out on its own
Or decays within a few hours
But in this case it kept getting accumulated in the nuclear core
because the power output was already so low
When high amounts of Xenon starts accumulating in the reactor core
it is known as Xenon poisoning
It kept slowing down the reaction
Seeing that very little electricity was produced
the shift supervisor Anatoly
ordered the workers to take out some of the control rods
He reasoned that taking out the control rods could speed up the reactions a bit
At 100 AM on 26th April
the power output reached 200 MW after taking out some of the control rods
But they still couldnt run their tests
Because they aimed to take the output to 700 MW
They had to speed up the reaction further
Anatoly gave the next set of instructions
He wanted to speed up the reactions by taking out more control rods
There are normally 211 control rods in a reactor
All but 8 of them were taken out
Only 8 control rods remained in the reaction chamber
This was a violation of the safety protocols
because it was clearly written in the rule book
that under any circumstances there should not be fewer than 15 control rods in the reactor
But here there were only 8 control rods in the reactor
Due to this the power output spiked up
At 0119 AM
because the control rods were abruptly taken out
the reaction spiked suddenly
The power output increased rapidly
and whatever little water was present in the core
turned into steam
It also meant that the amount of water in the reactor core kept decreasing
Remember water was supposed to work as the coolant
A positive feedback loop was created here
As the water turned into steam
it couldnt act as the coolant
resulting in the reaction gaining more speed
A fun fact here
to avoid this positive feedback loop
in the presentday nuclear reactors
water is used as a coolant and as a moderator both
So even if the amount of water decreases
the moderator will also decrease
so this will be the same as taking your foot off of the accelerator
And it would result in a negative feedback loop
But in this RBMK reactor graphite was the moderator
and the water was turning into steam rapidly
The Xenon present in the reactor till then
which was working to slow down the reaction
burned out when the reaction sped up
So there were no more Xenons to absorb the neutrons
This was the point of Extreme Power Surge
The speed of the nuclear reaction increased exponentially
A lot of steam was being produced here
and the lid of the containment structure
started shaking
Shockwaves were felt throughout the building
Workers realised that they have to execute an emergency stop
So they pressed the Emergency Stop button
It was at 0123 AM
Pressing this button meant that
the control rods would be reinserted into the reactor
to slow down the reaction
At a glance it would feel like a logical step
since our car is going at a high speed
we need to slam the brakes to slow it down
But there was a design flaw in this reactor
A design flaw related to the control rods
A control rod is actually made up of two parts
The main part of the control rod is made of Boron
it slows down the reaction by absorbing the Neutrons
But the tip of the control rods
were made of graphite
The same graphite that was used as a moderator in the reaction
That worked by speeding up the reaction
As soon as the button was pressed
and the remaining control rods were inserted into the reactor
the control rods with their graphite tips
This caused a blast
The graphite infinitely sped up the already speeding reaction
The power generation of the reactor reached 33000 MW
The first blast was 6 to 8 seconds after the emergency button was pressed
Because of this blast the core of the reactor started melting
After 23 seconds
there was an even more powerful blast
The 1000tonne lid on top of the structure
was blown into the air
The radioactive material started spreading through the atmosphere
The reason behind the second blast is said to be
the graphite present in the reactor started burning
It combusted as well
Two people were instantly killed in this blast
But more than 100 radioactive elements and 5 Uranium fuel
there were 192 tonnes of Uranium fuel in the reactor
went into the atmosphere
At 0126 AM the fire alarm began ringing
Firefighters reached the spot
Initially the firefighters didnt have an idea of what was happening there
When they reached the place
they assumed it was a normal fire
and started trying to put it out with water
But this fire was caused due to graphite
It wasnt about to die down easily
It took more than 10 days to put out this fire
Helicopters were called in to drop
thousands of tonnes of clay sand Boron and lead from the sky
These elements can reduce the spread of radiation
But it was extremely difficult to do this
Because to drop the elements on the fire
the helicopter would need to fly right on top of it
A truly dangerous task
One of the helicopters crashed due to this
Killing four people
The firefighters who had reached to put out the fire
experienced fatigue and nauseous after they went home
Symptoms of Radiation Sickness
When you are exposed to an extreme high dose of radiation
these symptoms begin appearing indicating that
you will die in a few months
The thing about radiation is that
the more you are exposed to radiation
the deadlier it is
About 28 of these firefighters passed away within a few months
People who were exposed to comparatively less radiation
died in a couple of years
and those who were exposed even less
developed diseases like cancer within 10 years
Coming back to the reactor the fire had died down after 10 days
But this reactor was producing high levels of heat even after the fire died down
It couldnt be controlled
Due to this heat the base of the reactor started cracking
It was highly problematic
Because there was a water tank under the reactor
Filled with radioactive water
If the reactor producing high levels of heat
came in contact with the water
the water would have instantly converted into steam
When temperatures are so high
that water is instantly converted into steam
this leads to an explosion
If youd recall your Chemistry lessons
liquids occupy lesser space than gas
Since the atoms are more spread out when in a gaseous form
They require more space
When the water converts into steam suddenly
there is often no space for the steam to exit
Because there isnt one it leads to an explosion
They were wary of a third blast
One thatd be bigger than the previous two
This blast would mean even more radioactive material being spread
There was only one way to prevent this from happening
A person had to dive into the radioactive water tank
and drain the radioactive water out of the reactor
To do this a reallife hero was needed
The water was radioactive
Anyone diving into the water
would be in a danger throughout their remaining life
They may die within a few years
Or even within a few months
They had to literally risk their lives to carry out the task
We had three such heroes
On 4th May 1986
wearing simple diving equipment
they dived into the water tank
They swam in the dark guided by only one lamp
They located the valves that had to be opened
to drain the water
These three heroes are so important in our story that youd find it difficult to believe
Because it is said that had the third explosion taken place
it wouldve been so dangerous that it might have killed millions of people
For the next 500000 years
almost the entirety of the European continent wouldve become uninhabitable
The good news is that all three divers survived
Boris passed away in 2005 due to a heart attack
Alexei and Valeri are still alive
Once this risk was dealt with
the next step was to clean up the radioactive waste lying there
Initially the officers of the Soviet Union used remotecontrolled robots to do this
But the robots started breaking down near the radioactive waste
Thousands of people had to be sent in to clean up
They were known as the liquidators
During 19861987
200000 liquidators were dispatched to actively clean up this area
When the fire caused by the blast was being put out
The Soviet Union government tried to cover up the whole incident
The Cold War was underway
So the Soviet Union didnt want the world to know what had transpired there
But it is something that couldnt be hushed up for long
Because the radioactive dust
had reached all the way to Sweden
Swedish monitoring stations detected that
the levels of radioactivity were unreasonably high
They carried out an analysis of the direction of the wind
and estimated the source of it
This forced the Soviet authorities to put the information about the disaster to the public
On 28th April 1986
the Soviet Union admitted that a disaster had indeed taken place
Two days after the actual disaster
The people living around this power plant
were told about what had happened after quite some time
This is another event for which the Soviet government is blamed
By 2nd May 1986
a 30 km radius was set up all around this nuclear power plant
It was declared an exclusion zone
This became a restricted area where no one could enter
except for scientists and government officials
To contain the radioactive waste
another structure was built on top of it
known as the Sarcophagus
It was completed by November 1986
a concrete and metal structure
to control the radiation coming off of it
But this structure wasnt built for the long term
About 28 years after it was constructed rust and cracks started forming
This is why in 2010
the construction of the new safe confinement began
This new structure was fit atop the existing sarcophagus
3 billion dollars were spent on building this new structure
It took 9 years to build it
Being completed only in 2019
But since it was built with a plan for the long term
it is said that this can keep the reactor closed off for the next 100 years
In 2018 the United Nations Scientific Community reported that
20000 cases of thyroid cancer were seen in children below the age of 18 years
Who lived through the disaster
The main reason for this is said to be
the radioactive dust settling on the grass
on the pastures where cattle were fed
After the cows ate the grass
their milk contained a high level of Iodine 131
It gets absorbed in our thyroid gland
leading to thyroid cancer in children
The trees around this area
had a red gingercoloured tint to them
This led to the area being called the Red Forest
In terms of the economics of it
the cost of the disaster to the Soviet Union
235 billion
Can you imagine how much money it is?
Emergency response cleaning up
relocating people paying the expenses of the survivors
carrying out evacuations and decontamination of the environment
they had to bear all expenses
Politically it is said to be a major reason
for the breakdown of the Soviet Union
Scientists all around the world started conducting research
on preventing such future nuclear disasters
As a direct result of this disaster
the World Association of Nuclear Operators was founded in 1989
The aim of this international organisation was to
conduct safety checks of all the nuclear power plants in the world
And to conduct research into how their safety can be further increased
I already mentioned one of its examples
how the presentday nuclear reactors
use water as the Moderator as well as the Coolant
In order to prevent any positive feedback loop
Even though there were high levels of radiation in this area
the remaining parts of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant
continued to be in operation until the year 2000
To meet the power needs of Ukraine
After that this power station was slated to be dismantled
And the process of doing so continues even now
It is expected that by 2028
this process would end
About 2400 people work in this plant now
Either they work as the guards
to defend the exclusion zone
or they are the firefighters scientists
technicians or service staff
Because the radiation levels are so high there
they work only 2 shifts a week
And they are regularly monitored to check the levels of radiation absorbed by them
The area around the plant
in the 30 km exclusion zone
has been completely abandoned by humans
Before the war began tourist groups did go to that zone
but more or less the area has been taken over by nature
Big animals like wolves deers lynx
beavers eagles boars and bears are found in this area
Some of these animals are even endangered
But they have a thriving population here
because of the lack of humans
Radiation has indeed affected some animals
and deformities have been spotted
but for the most part
there wasnt a major impact of the radiation on the animals
Friends this was the story of the Worlds Worst Nuclear Disaster
if you liked the video
you can watch the video on Bhopal Gas Tragedy to understand that in detail
I have made numerous videos on such historical events
you can click on this playlist to watch them all
In 1854 when India was under British Colonial rule
the then Governor General Lord Dalhousie
sent a 15yearold child from Punjab to England
Lord Dalhousie believed that
the mother of this child was a threat and had a bad character
and so it was important to take him away from the mother
In England this child converts to Christianity
and becomes fast friends with Queen Victorias son Edward VII
The responsibility of this child was given to the British Crown
and an annual stipend was paid to him
of 50000
If you adjust it for inflation today
it would amount to 650 million per year
Friends this child wasnt an ordinary boy
he was Prince Duleep Singh
Known as Maharaja Duleep Singh as well
The last ruler of the Sikh Empire in India
Interestingly 4 years before he was sent to England
in 1849 when the British defeated the Sikhs in the battle
Lord Dalhousie had ordered the 11yearold Duleep
to surrender a diamond to Queen Victoria
This was the Kohinoor Diamond
That year it travelled 6700 km on a ship to go to London
A legend attached to the Kohinoor diamond states that
He who owns this diamond will own the world
But will also know all its misfortunes
It is a superstition
known as the Curse of Kohinoor
Because friends every person who owned Kohinoor
had lived lives full of bloodshed violence and betrayals
This is the most infamous diamond in history
In todays video
come lets us delve into the interesting story of KohiNoor
The Kohinoor Diamond
is kept in the Tower of Londons Jewel House
for many years
but there have been regular demands to get it back from Britain
The Kohinoor diamond during the rule of the British
was taken from India to Britain
And became the jewel of the Queens crown
I saw the Kohinoor
The first eyewitness description of it
it was attached to the head of the peacock
on top of the Peacock Throne
Friends there are many prevalent theories regarding this
About the origin of Kohinoor
Where was it discovered?
A civil servant working for the East India Company
Theo Metcalfe
wrote in his report that according to tradition
this diamond was extracted during
the lifetime of Krishna
But according to historians
the most accepted view is that
this diamond was found in the Kollur Mines
in the Golconda region
Dont confuse it with the Kolar Mining area
which was popularised in the KGF film
The Golconda diamonds are found on the banks of the Krishna River
On coastal Andhra Pradesh
During the 18th century this area
was the only area in the world
where diamonds could be found
Until 1725 when diamond mines were discovered in Brazil
It isnt clear who was the one to discover the Kohinoor diamond and how
but normally the gemstones are found on the river beds of driedup rivers
Historically we dont even know
when was it discovered exactly
The best estimates of the historians claim that
it was discovered between the years 11001300
It is believed that the first mention of Kohinoor was in a Hindu text in 1306
The problem is that
no one knows the name of the text
Nor does anyone know who wrote it
The first written record of the mention of Kohinoor was in 1526
When the first Mughal emperor Zahirudin Babur came to India in 1526
In Baburnama he had written that
it is a diamond which
is worth half the daily expense of the whole world
It is believed that he had won the Kohinoor diamond as a prize
for winning a particular battle
The second mention of Kohinoor was by Shah Jahan in 1628
When he commissioned his famous Peacock Throne
It took 7 years for this throne to be finished
And it was four times as expensive as the Taj Mahal
A large amount of precious stones and gems were used to make this throne
but of tnumbert precious gems
one was the Kohinoor diamond
and the other was the Red Timur Ruby
An interesting fact
the Kohinoor wasnt the most precious gen owned by the Mughals
The Mughals prefered the Timur Ruby
so that was the most valuable stone for them
Because the Mughals preferred the brightly coloured stones
On the other hand the Hindu and Sikh kings preferred diamonds
You can consider this as a personal preference
the Kohinoor was given a prestigious place on the Peacock Throne
by making it the eye of the Peacock
The diamond hadnt been named Kohinoor yet
Around 100 years later
under the Mughals Delhi had become one of the wealthiest cities in the world
more than 2 million people lived here
greater than the combined population of London and Paris
But by this point in time
the Mughal Empire had weakened
The wealth of Delhi attracted Persias Nadir Shah
In 1739 Nadir Shah invaded Delhi
and defeated Mohammed Shah
Mohammed Shah was the 15th Mughal emperor
the greatgrandson of Aurangzeb
Nadir Shah too many treasures from Delhi with him when he returned
700 elephants 4000 camels
and 12000 horses were needed
to carry the treasures
Among these treasures was the Kohinoor diamond as well
A common belief has it that
Nadir Shah had received a tip from an official working in the Mughal Empire
that Mohammed Shah had hidden the Kohinoor diamond in his turban
There used to be an old war custom of exchanging turbans
so Nadir Shah proposed to exchange turbans with Mohammed Shah
when the Kohinoor diamond fell to the ground
It shone so brightly under the light
that Nadir Shah uttered
It literally meant Mountain of Light
And thus this diamond was named
But Nadir Shahs financial official of the time
wrote a book Tarikhi Alamarayi Nadiri
The content of the book provided us with a written record
That the Kohinoor was attached to the head of the Peacock Throne
Nadir Shah took the Peacock Throne with him
and wore the Timur Ruby and Kohinoor diamond on his armband
The origin story of the name of this diamond
may not be true
The part that it was hidden in a turban
but it is true that
Nadir Shah had named this diamond Kohinoor
Because this book has the reference to the diamond as Kohinoor
For the next 70 years Kohinoor remained the part of present day Afghanistan
This is where the Curse of Kohinoor comes to play
I talked about it in the beginning of the video
The owner of the diamond would own the world
but all the misfortunes will fall on him
This saying is taken from the Hindu text written in 1306
as I told you before
it is believed to be the very first mention of the Kohinoor diamond
but as you will see that it is true to some extent
Misfortune fell on Nadir Shah on 1747
When Nadir Shah was killed by his guard
His empire collapsed as a result
Ahmad Shah Durrani
also known as Ahmad Khan Abdali
Was a member of Nadir Shahs army
He became the founder of the new Afghan empire
And with it the new owner of the Kohinoor diamond
William Dalrymple and Anita Anands book tells us
that the grandson of Nadir Shah
Shahrukh Shah
had molten lead poured on his head
similar to what was shown in Game of Thrones
to find out where Kohinoor was hidden
You can call it the curse of Kohinoor or anything else
but there were a lot of infighting in the Durrani empire as well
Ahmads son Timur ran the empire adeptly
but later Ahmads grandsons
fought amongst each other for the throne
Timurs son the third ruler of the empire
Zaman Shah Durrani
was blinded with hot needles
His brother the fifth ruler was Shuja Shah Durrani
His wife had said that
if a strong man threw four pebbles in four directions
North South East and West
and then threw a fifth pebble into the air
and the space enclosed by the five pebbles
were filled with gold
the value of all the gold there would still not match Kohinoors value
Shuja Shah Durrani wore the Kohinoor on his bracelet
In 1809 he was dethroned
and he fled with the Kohinoor diamond to Lahore
There he took refuge from Maharaja Ranjith Singh
Ranjith Singh was the founder of the Sikh Empire
and in exchange for providing refuge to Durrani
he asked for the Kohinoor diamond
And so the Kohinoor diamond went to the Sikh empire in 1813
Even for Ranjith Singh Kohinoor held a lot of symbolic importance
The land usurped by the Durrani dynasty
was won back by him
He was known as the Lion of Lahore
or the SherePunjab
And he wore the Kohinoor on his bicep
In an armlet
Some years later East India Companys hold over India was getting stronger
when the British came to know about the death of Ranjith Singh in 1839
they also came to know of his plan
to give this diamond to some Hindu priests
The British newspapers of the time
were infuriated with this
One of the newspapers published
The richest the most costly gem in the known world
has been committed to the trust of a profane
idolatrous and mercenary priesthood
The British government ordered the East India Company
to keep an eye on the Kohinoor diamond
To continue tracking where it goes
and look for the opportunity to get it for the British treasury
The British had to wait for nearly a decade
After Ranjith Singhs death in 1839
the Punjabi throne was passed on to four rulers over the next four years
By 1843 there were only two people standing
One Ranjith Singhs wife Rani Jindan
and the other a fiveyearold child
Prince Duleep Singh
Finally when the second AngloSikh war ended in 1849
the East India Company ended the rule of the Punjab empire
By then Duleep Singh was about 10 years old
EIC made him sign a Treaty of Lahore
As per this treaty
the Kohinoor diamond was supposed to be handed over to the East India Company
Punjab was the last major state that hadnt been conquered by the British
After winning this war
the East India Company didnt want to leave any scope
to allow the Sikh Empire to sprout once again
And so they jailed Jindan
and the only other remaining family member
was shipped to London
and converted to Christianity
When Duleep Singh was merely 15yearsold
he was sent to London in 1854
In July 1854
when Duleep Singhs portrait was being painted in the Buckingham Palace
Queen Victoria gave him an opportunity to see the Kohinoor once again
He held it in his hand
and it is said that the words he spoke were
During the last years of his life Duleep Singh
rebelled against England
he tried to return to India
but he was prevented by the British
He tried to get the help of the Germans
But unfortunately he remained unsuccessful
It is said that he had an unfortunate death
at 55 years old in Paris
His living conditions were quite bad by then
he was living in poverty
On the other hand Kohinoor became a special possession of Queen Victoria
the curse of Kohinoor
warning any man who owned it
also said that
Only a God or a woman can wear it with impunity
Without any adverse consequences
In 1851 in the Hyde Park of London
an exhibition was held
wherein the British people had the opportunity to see the Kohinoor
But the public reaction was quite unexpected
People were surprised to see empires fighting over a small piece of rock
People couldnt believe that it was the same Kohinoor diamond
for which people had killed one another
To them it simply looked like a glass piece
Not unlike any normal piece of glass
It was reported by the Times newspaper in June 1851
After the disappointing reaction of the public
Queen Victorias husband Prince Albert
commissioned the recutting and polishing of Kohinoor in 1852
So that light could be reflected better
and it could shine more
He wanted people to be mesmerised by looking at it
But due to this process
Kohinoor lost 40 of its weight
It used to be 186 carats
and after the recutting and polishing
it was left with 1056 carats
presently the dimensions of Kohinoor diamond are
Kohinoor is now about as big as a chickens egg
Moving on with our story
when the British got their hands on Kohinoor
they too were scared of the Curse of Kohinoor
So going forward the British Royal Family decided
that they wouldnt give the Kohinoor to a man
When the monarch would be male
the Queen Consort would be the one to wear the Kohinoor
And that whys over the next years
when the British throne was passed on
Kohinoor always went to the Queen
Eventually it became a part of the Crown Jewels
It was first put in Queen Alexandras crown
then in Queen Marys
and finally in 1937
it was embedded in the crown
worn by the mother of the present Queen of England
The Queen Mothers funeral was held in 2002
when the crown was last seen in public
Currently this crown and the Kohinoor
can be found in the Tower of Londons
Waterloo barracks
in the Jewel House inside it
They are kept there
Over the last 800 years of Kohinoors history
the British monarchy has been the owner of Kohinoor for the longest
Kohinoor has been with them for 173 years

Now lets return to the topic
Many Indians feel quite emotional towards the Kohinoor
Shashi Tharoors 2015 Oxford Union speech had become very famous
Indias share of the world economy
when Britain arrived on its shores
was 23
By the time the British left
it was down to below 4
India was already Britains biggest cash cow
the worlds biggest purchaser of British goods
and exports
His arguments were praised by Prime Minister Modi as well
He laid out the economic and prosperity potential lost by India
due to British colonialism
And Kohinoor is now a symbol of this British colonialism
The question is whether the Kohinoor diamond
was stolen by the British from India
or was it a gift?
That was given to them in exchange of the deal
1 year after Shashi Tharoors 2015 speech
in 2016 a petition was filed in the Supreme Court by an NGO
The petition stated that the government should get the Kohinoor back
That the Indian government should demand
that the British government return the diamond
But Ranjith Kumar the governments representative in court
said that the diamond was a part of the Lahore Treaty
neither has it been stolen nor taken forcefully
and to try to get it back would be futile
Later the Archaeological Survey of India said on behalf of the government
that they would try their best to get back the Kohinoor using friendly ways
It was said that the arguments by Mr Kumar
did not represent the views of the government
But legally speaking
there are no legal grounds for Kohinoors return to India
The only legal route present here
is the 1970 UNESCO Convention
The Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing
the Illicit Import Export and Transfer of
Ownership of Cultural Property
The cultural heritage of the country that was taken to another illegally
through unfair means
But there are two problems with this convention
First it cannot be applied retrospectively
The cultural heritage that was taken before 1970
does not have to be mandatorily returned
And the other thing is that
Cultural Heritage has been defined in Article 1 of the Convention
as a property which on religious or secular grounds
is specifically designated by each State
as being of importance for archaeology
prehistory history literature art or science
The second problem is that even if the  cultural heritage is returned
which country should get it?
The situation is quite complicated
because of the present borders drawn between the countries
are quite recent
The kingdoms which existed before this
during the monarchies
had dynamic borders which were redrawn very often
Today the sovereign territories of
India Afghanistan and Pakistan
exist only after their Independence
Before this there used to be kingdoms
Technically speaking
Kohinoor diamond has not been taken from the sovereign territories of
India Afghanistan or Pakistan
Because those territories were created only after a specific date
But the Kohinoor was taken before that from kingdoms
Another question here is
whom should Kohinoor be returned to?
In Afghanistan Talibans spokesperson said in 2000
that they want Kohinoor back in their country
In 2016 a petition was filed in Pakistans Lahore High Court
because the British had stolen the Kohinoor
from presentday Pakistan
Because the capital of the Sikh empire was Lahore
Anthropologist Richard Kurin says that logically
Kohinoor can be returned to several countries
Afghanistan Pakistan India and even Iran
can rightfully claim the ownership of this diamond
Because back then stealing and plundering used to be quite common
But back then none of these countries existed
Even though geographically their regions existed
It should be differentiated from other events
for example the cultural heritage stolen by the Nazis
where it can be clearly seen
the country the theft took place in
Because these countries existed already
Emotionally as well Richard Kurin says
we should let go of Kohinoor forever
So that its dark history is not repeated
and it is allowed to rest at its final resting place
What is your opinion?
Write in the comment section below
Should the government try to get Kohinoor back?
Or should we let it be there?

Today China is one of the most powerful countries in the world
But can you imagine that only 40 years ago
the poverty rate in this country was over 90?
Poverty and starvation had made the country miserable
But in the next 30 years
we saw such a huge transformation
that the poor starving country reached thus far
In 1978 Chinas contribution to the global GDP
was only 2
Today China contributes more than 18 to the global GDP
Their poverty rate is less than 1
and China is the secondlargest economy in the world
In many ways it can be considered a superpower country
But how was this possible?
What was the magic they used?
Come in this video lets do a detailed case study on China
China was emerging from its cultural revolution
as one of the worlds poorest nations
1978 Deng Xiaoping had an idea
one that would turn Communist China on its head
Since then China has made
enormous strides in various fields
So how did one of the worlds poorest countries
become a global superpower
in just 4 decades?
China is named after the Chinese word Qin
It is written as QIN
but pronounced as Chin
Qin was the name of an old dynasty
which ruled China 2000 years ago
and unified China
This is why we refer to Chinese people
as Chini in Hindi
What came from Chin is Chini
And another interesting fact here about
the actual Chini the Hindi name for white refined sugar
It is believed that refined white sugar
was brought to India by a Chinese man
A Chinese man either opened a sugar mill
or somehow sugar came from the Chinese route
Before that we used unrefined sugar and jaggery
Because a Chini person brought sugar
we started calling the sugar Chini
Another interesting fact here is that
Chinese people do not refer to their country as China
They use the name Zhongguo for their country
It means the Middle Kingdom
It symbolizes Chinas 4000 years old history
How China used to be the centre of the world
It was in the middle
You can see on the map
China is the worlds 4th largest country
It borders India
But most of the Chinese population
actually lives quite far from India on the East Coast
This is because the fertile land on which agriculture is possible
is mostly situated in that area
In the West there are the Himalayan mountains and deserts
Because of its size China used to be a very successful
and powerful kingdom till the 19th century
And after that it was affected by colonialism
Although the British could not fully occupy China
as they did on the Indian subcontinent
but still China was looted in different ways
the period from 1839 to 1949 is remembered
as the Century of Humiliation by the Chinese
It starts in 1839 when the British East India Company
began exporting opium to China
Opium is a drug to which many Chinese people got heavily addicted
and the entire Chinese society was destroyed
After this many treaties were forced upon China
per which China had to hand over
significant portions of land and its ports to the British
Then in 1850 there was a terrible civil war in China
called the Taiping Rebellion
Millions of people were killed
Fast forward 40 years
and you see the first SinoJapanese War in 1894
China and Japan went to war over territory
I wont go into the details
but the Qing Dynasty was ruling China at that time
Dont confuse it with the Qin dynasty
the root of the name China
That Qin dynasty is 2000 years old
This was the QING dynasty
The other was the QIN dynasty
Same pronunciation
From 1937 to 1945
Chinese people had to endure even more terrible torture
This time by the hands of Japanese colonisers
In the World War 2 video
I explained how China was a part of the Allied Powers
It was fighting against Japan
In World War 2 around 30 million Chinese were killed
In the midst of all this a ray of hope was seen when
China and the Allied Forces finally won World War II
Japan retreated
But right after the end of WWII
a civil war broke out in China
A war between the Chinese Communist Party and the Nationalist Party KMT
It started in 1927
but when Japan invaded during World War II
they had stopped fighting temporarily
The civil war ended in 1949
with the victory of the Chinese Communist Party
The people of the Nationalist Party
fled to a nearby island
which is now called Taiwan
And the mainland China
was ruled by Mao Zedong
This was the point where it can be said that
China was formed as the country we now know
1st October 1949
Peoples Republic of China was born
The leader of the Communists
and the hero of the revolution
is Mao Zedong
In 1958 Mao launched
the Great Leap Forward Campaign
Its aim was to bring economic
and social transformation to the country
There were two main policies in this
First to take the land from the landowners
and distribute it among the farmers
Land redistribution
Thereafter collectivizing agriculture
Agricultural cooperatives were made so that
more farmers could work on the same land
But ultimately the ownership of the land
was in the hands of the government
Second industrialization
On the one hand large industrial plants were built for steel production
And on the other hand telling people to make
smallscale steel furnaces in their backyards
to produce steel at a local level
The intention was good
To develop the country economically
But the result was very bad
The smallscale steel furnaces that people had built in their gardens
were producing lowquality steel
This led to the resources being wasted
Secondly the farmers did not have
any incentive to increase their production
because there was no profit sharing
and no private ownership
The ownership of the land was ultimately
in the hands of the government
So whatever crop was being grown by the farmers
had to be handed over to the government
This led to a huge decline in productivity
Between 1958 and 1961
the grain production fell by 15
In just a few years due to bad weather and
some other masterstroke policies of the Mao regime
the situation got so bad that the whole country was starving
The famine was so terrible that
around 2040 million people died in this famine in China
It is known as one of the deadliest famines in history
To put it bluntly Mao Zedong was a dictator
And because there is no checks and balances system for dictators
as there is in a democracy
dictators often have a habit of
imposing their wills without thinking or testing
Several such decisions by Mao made China worse
Another example of such decisions
was the Sparrow Extermination
Maos intention was to increase food production
So it was ordered that all the sparrows
and all the birds should be killed
because those birds ate the grains
They eat some crop grains from the fields
So the crops are affected by the crops
so all the birds in the country were to be exterminated
When this campaign was run and sparrows were killed
a few years later people realised that
the insects and pests were multiplying so rapidly
they were causing more damage to the crops
This worsened the food shortage
Later a scientist found that if all the birds are killed
then no one would be left to eat those insects
The birds used to eat the insects
which kept the insect population in control
The entire ecological balance was disturbed
And the situation worsened so terribly that it led to a famine
After such a big failure Mao was criticized
by the Chinese public and by the Communist Party too
But Mao Zedong was not willing to admit his mistake
Another campaign was started
Cultural Revolution in 1966
The name suggests that it was meant to
bring a revolution of culture in the country
but the real purpose was
to give control to Mao and suppress the opposition
Propaganda and PR machinery were used extensively here
To show off his power Mao swam in the Yangtze River
There is a famous photo of him
A civilian army is formed by the students
the Red Guards
Red Guards were loyal soldiers of Mao who had
red armbands on their hands
and they used to carry a small red book by Mao
Their job was to target those who were against Mao
Intellectuals party officials all those who were not loyal to Maos ideology
were targeted publicly humiliated
and often violence against them was also seen
There were people in the Communist Party who
were criticizing the Cultural Revolution
criticizing Mao
and they were also targeted by the Red Guards
Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping
were some of the highranking party officials
targeted by the Red Guards
In the name of this revolution a fear environment was created in the whole country
People were encouraged to spy on their neighbours family members
to find the traitors
a traitor was someone who was against Maos ideology
people had to find them and report about them
Schools and universities were shut down
Students were told to go to the farms and
learn the condition of the farmers
To experience the hardships of rural life
As time passed things became out of control
Red Guards started fighting among themselves
Historical sites and cultural artifacts were destroyed
Peoples lives were turned upside down
This was the time when Tibetans were also tortured
I have told you the story in the Dalai Lama video
If you havent seen it I will put the link in the description below
Finally Mao realized
the Cultural Revolution
created a crisis in the country
It was dividing the country
So in 1968 to regain control
the Red Guards system was abolished
The estimates vary a lot depending upon the source
but it is said that hundreds of thousands to 2 million people
lost their lives because of the Cultural Revolution
In total it is said that up to 50 million people
died in China because of Maos policies
In 1976 Mao Zedong passed away due to poor health
And till then there were no major improvements to Chinas condition
But it is not that there were only failures and bad things
during Maos reign
There were some positive achievements too
Especially in terms of womens equality and education
A nationwide public education system was launched during Maos rule
Campaigns were run by the government to end illiteracy
And during Maos leadership
Chinas literacy rate improved a lot
In 1978 compared to 1949
China had 3 times more primary and secondary schools
At the same time a strong foundation was formed
with the help of which China helped millions of people to get out of poverty
Moving forward as you will see in the story
his government made strategic investments
in education in the fields of science technology engineering and mathematics
which are called STEM fields
With the help of this a talent pool was created in the country
which led the countrys technological progress

And now lets get back to the topic of the video
Maos opinion about women was that
Women hold up half the sky
In 1950 a new marriage law was passed according
to which arranged marriages and forced marriages
were made illegal across the country
Women were given the right to divorce and
in many other aspects women were brought on equal footing
But if we come back to the time of 1976
a new leader comes to power after Maos death in China
in the Chinese Communist Party
Deng Xiaoping
He is also called the father of modern China
because during his leadership
the real transformation of China begins
Deng Xiaoping was one of those who raised
his voice against Mao during Maos time
Because of this during the Cultural Revolution
he was forced to resign from all his positions
It was obvious that Deng Xiaopings ideology
was very different from Maos ideology
Deng believed that the government had extremely tight control
over the Chinese economy
Which was the cause of the destruction of China over the preceding 50 years
He wanted to free the economy
Thats why he introduced his policies of Economic Liberalization
There are many aspects to this
which we will discuss one by one
But his overall ideology is today known as
Socialism with Chinese Characteristics
First to bring transformation in the agriculture system
Deng introduced a household responsibility system
When Mao launched his Great Leap Forward campaign
private farming was completely abolished
No individual was allowed to own land
All ownership was in the hands of the government at the local level
Deng did not change this ownership structure
The ownership remained in the hands of the government of the village
But individual farmers and their families
were given the land on longterm leases
Those farmers will have the right to decide
which crops to grow
how to manage their business
and from where to earn profit
So the farmers got more freedom to grow crops of their choosing
Second Deng said that all farmers will have
to sell a certain amount of their crops to the government
But after meeting that quota
they can sell the excess produce wherever they want
and earn extra profit
So this motivated the farmers to innovate
Their productivity increased
Some similar land reforms
were brought in India after Independence
in states like Kerala and West Bengal
which are said to be major reasons
why states like Kerala have been able to develop so much
Although the specifics of these reforms were different
We can discuss them in another video
But Deng Xiaoping used the same idea on factories
Factory Manager Responsibility System was introduced
Before this during Maos leadership
the responsibility to manage the industrial factories in China
were given to the members of the Communists Party
There was a lot of political interference
But under Dengs leadership the responsibility
was shifted to the workers and managers working in the factories
They allowed them more freedom to decide what
they want to produce their production target
the prices at which they will sell the products
and the salaries they would draw
Once again the workers working in the factory
got an incentive to work harder
Imagine it for yourself there is a factory that
manufactures shoes for example
Now the workers and managers working in the factory
have the right to decide
the number of shoes to be produced materials to be used
the selling prices of the shoes and the salaries paid to them
The workers developed a sense of ownership
and accountability
It was their factory and they could make it successful if they wanted to
During Maos leadership there was a lot of centralised planning
A person sitting on top dictating everything
How everything should be running
The government decided everything
Everything that happened or did not happen
But during the time of Deng there was decentralization
More freedom was given in the economic sense
Because of all these policy measures
millions of people started coming out of poverty and
peoples lives started changing
Between 1978 and 1984
on average agriculture output in China
increased at the rate of 74
The grain production in China
doubled between the late 1970s and mid1980s
The next big step was to bring about a revolution in education
To focus on educating people
Because of this in 1986
a compulsory education law was introduced by the government
For 9 years free and compulsory education for every child in China
Compare this to India
The Right to Education Act was introduced in India after so many years
In 2009
On top of that there was no standstill in China after the law was passed
The government started spending more on peoples education consistently
In 1980 the money spent by the government on education
was approximately 2 of GDP in China
And it kept increasing
By 2010 it reached 41 of GDP
Compare it with India
According to the latest figure in India
our government has spent 29 of the Indian GDP on education
Not only that China has also focused on technical and vocational education
People were taught the skills
that are actually needed in jobs
Friends if you have seen my Singapore video
you might be thinking that these actions sound familiar
Because it is friends
All the developed countries
have focused heavily on education
And they are developed because
education was given such a big priority
Because of all these measures
we saw an amazing improvement in the literacy rate in China
In 1982 it was at 65
and in 2012 it crossed 95
For comparison Indias total literacy rate is still at 77
Similarly spending money on healthcare is another big indicator
In 2021 China spent 559 of GDP on its health
And India according to the 2020 data spent around 296
The next development strategy of Deng Xiaoping
was Township and Village Enterprises
also known as TVEs
This is quite similar to the cooperative model of India in many ways
Cooperatives are usually owned in India by
the workers working in the cooperatives
but on the other hand the ownership of TVEs
are held by townships and villages
Both have the same purpose
to bring economic growth in rural areas
and to improve peoples living standards
In India we have seen cooperatives mostly
in the agricultural and dairy sectors like Amul
but TVEs have been seen in almost every sector in China
Textiles electronics manufacturing services
In fact a big example of TVE is Huawei Technologies
This company started as a TVE in the area of Shenzhen
But today it has become a global leader
in telecommunications equipment
Another good example of this is the city of Wenzhou China
Here some local people established small factories to make shoes
Slowly it expanded
and became so big that
today the shoe industry of Wenzhou
is a major export sector in China
The shoes made here are not only sold in China
but are also sold outside of China
By the early 1990s TVE was employing around
100 million people in China
Peoples living standards started to increase
Usually there is an income gap in rural and urban areas
But here this income gap reduced because of TVEs
About 20 of Chinas total industrial output
was from TVEs in the 1990s
Millions of jobs were generated because of this
But this could only happen when people were
already educated and skilled to do all this
In 1980 Deng set up special economic zones in China
in which tax incentives were given
the bureaucratic process was made easier
fewer regulations were imposed
so that foreign investment could flow into the country
Many times when people tell the story of Chinas development
they mention this point first
But I am mentioning this point later because
to reach this point
China had to take many other steps
to make this possible
to bring in foreign investment successfully
When foreign companies invest in the country
they need skilled people
If people are not educated and skilled no one will invest money
Here the labour was cheap people were skilled
only a little bureaucracy
and people already had the experience required because of TVEs
Shenzhen became the first Special Economic Zone in China
This city used to be a small fishing village
but in a few years it became a major international metropolis
In 1980 Shenzhens GDP was 03 billion dollars
By 2020 it reached 420 billion dollars
To encourage foreign companies to come to the country
an opendoor policy was made
Chinas economy was open to the world
This is called economic liberalization
It was done in China in 1978
And in India Economic liberalization was seen later in 1991
We are in a phase of restructuring our economy
that our country is unable to launch
a certain industrial revolution
a certain agricultural revolution
that our country is unable to integrate itself
into the world economy
in a manner in which we can take advantage of the opportunities
offered by the new global economy
Because of this many multinational companies
like Nike Apple Volkswagen
set up their manufacturing facilities in China
In 1980 Chinas FDI was 006 billion
In 2021 it exceeded 333 billion
Apart from all this the government also focused on infrastructure development
Railway lines were built good public transport in cities
And along with this the government made scientific research a priority
The Deng introduced a crash training program
for more than 800000 Chinese researchers
Priority areas were made
Energy production computers optics
space technology physics and genetics
These science research centers were given heavy funding by the government
The money spent on research and development
was gradually increased by the government
and in 2020 it crossed 500 billion
A big example of this
is the Zhongguancun Science Park in Beijing
built in 1988
It is a hub of technology and innovation
Many hightech companies research institutions
and universities are situated here
In 1990 India and China were almost on the same line
In fact if you look at GDP per capita
Indias GDP per capita was more than Chinas
1202 vs 983 for China
But their change was so remarkable that today
Chinas GDP per capita is more than three times that of Indias
According to the 2020 figures
Indias is 6454 and
China is at 17312
With regard to these revolutionary policies
Deng Xiaoping said that
he took the approach of crossing the river by feeling the stones
That we cross the river by evaluating at each and every stone
Every decision that was taken
was taken in a pragmatic and practical manner
After a lot of thought
It is not that a dictator had an abrupt idea
of what could be done to change the country
And without any further thought or consultations with advisors
the Dictator imposed his decision
We learn from Deng Xiaoping that how bringing reforms
is a gradual process
that should be undertaken after thorough evaluations
It should be tested at every step
and the policies should be adjusted as needed
It is not that Deng Xiaoping was
a perfect hero in our story
Or that he did not do anything wrong
Economically his ideology did favour freedom
but politically he was still a dictator
It was during his reign that in 1989
the Tiananmen Square massacre took place
One thing that was ignored in all these policies
was the environment
What effect did it have on the ecology?
And the authoritarianism that continued during Deng Xiaopings reign
resulted in the presentday conditions under Xi Jinpings rule
Had Deng Xiaoping wanted
he could have transitioned China into a democracy
But he didnt
For this reason today a dictator emerged
who again runs his own will
and imposes decisions without thinking twice
This is the reason why during the pandemic in 2020
China saw many scary lockdowns
Restrictions are being imposed on peoples freedom once again
you will also like the Singapore video
in which I have explained how Singapore
became the number one country in Asia
What is the mystery of the Taj Mahal?
Whats hiding behind the 22 closed doors of the Taj Mahal?
Some people claim that idols of Hindu Gods are hidden behind them
On the other hand some say that they are hiding the fabled good days
The first door hiding cheap petrol and diesel
the second hiding employment opportunities
Some people have gone further and said that the Taj Mahal is actually a Shiv Temple
whose real name is Tejo Mahalaya
According to a theory it wasnt built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan
rather it was built by Raja Paramardi Dev
in the 13th century
After that it was passed down to Raja Maan Singh
and Shah Jahan bought the Taj Mahal
from his grandson Raja Jai Singh
Another popular theory about the Taj Mahal is that
Shah Jahan had chopped off the hands of 20000 labourers
after building the Taj Mahal
so the workers who worked on the Taj Mahal
couldnt build any other monument as beautiful as it
In one theory the Tejo Mahalaya was built in the 13th century
In the other Shah Jahan had chopped off the hands of the workers in the 17th century
about 450 years later
So both theories cannot be true
So in todays video come lets try to find out the truth
What is the history of the Taj Mahal?
How much truth do these theories hold?
And whats hidden behind the 22 closed doors of the Taj Mahal?
The 7th Wonder of the World a symbol of love
Its said that history is based on facts and not on emotions
What history? Whose history? Whose version of history?
BJP government demands the 22 closed doors of the Taj Mahal be reopened
And the judges have slammed the Taj Mahal petitioner
Friends lets understand the real history of the Taj Mahal first
Shah Jahan and Mumtaz
What were their real names?
Shah Jahan was born on 5th January 1592
his real name was Khurram
Shah Jahan was the royal name
which was bestowed on him later
literally meaning the King of the World
Shah Jahan
His father was Jahangir and his mother was Jagat Gosain
The chief queen of Jahangir
Mumtaz Mahal was born in 1593
The name Mumtaz Mahal was bestowed on her after her wedding
Her real name was Arjumand Banu Begum
Khurram and Mumtaz were engaged in 1907
and they were married in 1612
Shah Jahan had other wives as well
Including Qandahari Mahal and Akbarabadi Mahal
But according to court historians
these marriages were based on political alliances
Various historical accounts tell us that
Shah Jahans relationship with his other wives
were marriages only in name
They were simply to maintain political alliances
Shah Jahans affection and love for Mumtaz
was much more than that for his other wives
this is why she was given more favours
Such as the title of MalikaiJahan
The Queen of the World
Her palace Khas Mahal
was said to have been decorated with pure gold and precious stones
According to historical records
Mumtaz showed great interest in administration as well
So when Shah Jahan went for diplomatic negotiations
or for war
Mumtaz always accompanied him
Shah Jahan had exactly one child with all his other wives
with Mumtaz Mahal he had 14 children
Half of the children died during childbirth
This used to be much more common back then
The healthcare system used to be terrible
Unfortunately Mumtaz died while giving birth to their 14th child
It happened on 17th June 1631
The cause of death is said to be postpartum haemorrhage
Loss of blood
After her death Shah Jahan went into deep grief
He was paralysed with grief
He cried for days and weeks on end
And it is said that he was in isolation for a year mourning the death of his wife
When he appeared again its said that his hair had turned white
His back was bent
and his face showed his despair
In Islamic theology it is believed that
the body of the deceased turns into soil
but the soul remains in the grave
Later on Judgement Day the souls will return to the Creator
when itll be decided if the soul would go to heaven or hell
So the grave is known as the final resting place of a soul
Shah Jahan believed that the final resting place of Mumtaz Mahal
should be grand
When he decided to build the Taj Mahal
the Chief Architect was Ustad Ahmad Lahori
was bestowed the title NadireAsr
The Wonder of the Age
The calligraphy on the white marble panels
was done by Abdul Haq Shirazi
More than 1000 elephants were used
for transporting the building materials
The white marble was brought in from Rajasthan
Jasper from Punjab
Jade and Crystal from China
Turquoise from Tibet
Sapphire from Sri Lanka
And Carnelian from Arabia
The gems and materials that can be found in the Taj Mahal
have come from all over the world
In total it took 22 years to build the Taj Mahal
For its construction and decoration
Approximately 22000 labourers
worked on it every day for 22 years
Friends the history of controversies about the Taj Mahal has been long
But lets begin our story with the most recent controversy
The recent controversy began with the news
that BJP politician Rajneesh Singh
had filed a petition in Allahabad High Court
that the 22 closed rooms of the Taj Mahal should be opened
He wanted ASI the Archaeological Survey of India
to set up a special committee
to look into the 22 closed rooms
And would investigate if there are any idols of Hindu Gods in there
This petition held that
there were claims that the Taj Mahal is actually a Hindu Temple
called Tejo Mahalaya
and that it was the duty of the court to direct the opening of the closed doors
under the Freedom of Information
But this petition was dismissed by the court
the bench of judges said that
by filing such petitions
the PIL system was being mocked
The court asked for the basis of the petition
Whether any legal or constitutional rights were being infringed here
If not what were the grounds for the petition?
Historical research is handled by historians
and for that proper methodology needs to be followed
But friends if you think that after the dismissal of this petition
the secret would always remain a secret
dont fret
In this video Ill tell you the secret hidden behind the locked doors
Friends the thing is that
ASI sources have already told the Indian Express
that these 22 rooms arent rooms really
Its actually a long corridor
with doors on its side
And the locked doors in question havent always been locked
According to the source the ASI staff
clean out the corridor each week or in a couple of weeks
A retired ASI official has said that
theres nothing on the walls
To have such rooms in the basement is not unusual for Mughal monuments
The Humayuns Tomb in Delhi  and the Safdarjung Tomb
both have similar underground rooms in the basement
They make up a corridor
and act as the structural element
on which the monument rests
Another retired ASI official revealed that
the area was cordoned off
because there was nothing for the tourists to see
If they are kept open unnecessarily
there would be a crowd there
So to preserve the monument the areas have been locked
After all the Taj Mahal is a protected World Heritage Site
with more than 100000 visitors every day
So with so many people constantly passing through
they wanted to avoid the wear and tear and protect the monument
Even after the petition was dismissed
after ASI officials explained things
the debate didnt stop
Some people in the media and social media kept this debate on unreasonably
It seemed almost like someone was benefiting from this
by discussing these things
So after about 3 or 4 days
the Archaeological Survey of India
tried to end this debate forever
by releasing pictures
They publicly shared photos of the closed rooms
They showed the restoration work going on
and what the rooms looked like from the inside
Agras ASI Chief R K Patel told India Today
that the pictures can be found live on the website of ASI
And that it was a part of their newsletter
and anyone can see the pictures by going to their website
There was one thing noteworthy in these photos
and it was the hard work of the ASI staff
for the conservation of our monuments
You can see the before and after pictures here
before and after the restoration works
It is only due to them
that our historical gems continue to be preserved like so
Friends this wasnt the first time that such claims were made
There were several similar petitions before this as well
Such as in April 2015
a similar suit was filed in the Agra court by six lawyers
who claimed that the Taj Mahal was actually a Shiv Temple
They asked the court for permission
to allow Hindus to worship there
In their plea lawyer Hari Shankar Jain and his colleagues said that
that it was Raja Paramardi Dev who built Tejo Mahalaya in 1212 AD
And that this temple was later inherited by Raja Maan Singh in the 17th century
After which the property was held by Raja Jai Singh
and then in 1632 Shah Jahan annexed it
After the death of Mumtaz Mahal
after the death of Shah Jahans wife
this temple was converted into a memorial for Mumtaz
Then the court directed the Central Government
Union Ministry of Culture
Home Secretary and the ASI
to submit their replies to this claim
In the reply the government denied this possibility
In November 2015 the Union Cultural Minister Mahesh Sharma
told the Lok Sabha that the government found no evidence
that the Taj Mahal was a Hindu Temple
The ASI said the same thing
In 2017 the Archaeological Survey of India had said
that the Taj Mahal is a tomb not a temple
This is quite different from the Gyanvapi Masjid controversy
because theres actually proof
that there was once a temple
But lets discuss that controversy in some other video
and lets focus on the Taj Mahal in this video
They clarified the story about Raja Jai Singh
and said that the land was annexed from him
instead it was given by him in exchange
It has an interesting history behind it friends
In 2017 historian Rana Safi had written a blog
on the DailyO platform
a blogging platform of the India Today group
In it she wrote that Mughals were very interested in keeping a record of history
Many Mughal Emperors had written autobiographies
they wrote in journals
Such as Jahangirnama written by Jahangir
Additionally they even had the official history written down by court historians
For example during Akbars reign
AbulFazl had kept a record of history
Apart from these there were other accounts of history
written by other people of the era
These are known as Contemporary Accounts
These contemporary texts were compiled by
W E  Begley and Z A Desai
in their book Taj Mahal The Illumined Tomb
The various sources of that time
were compiled together so that we can see them in that context
and get to know the detailed history of the Taj Mahal
How the Taj Mahal was built
What were the methods used back then?
All of it has been documented beautifully
Raja Jai Singh had friendly relations with Shah Jahan
We get to know that Raja Jai Singh used to live in the area
where the Taj Mahal is built
That place has been referred to in multiple sources as Haveli Khana and Manzil
Different sources use different words
But these words were used to mean home
Small or big Raja Jai Singhs home was there
Raja Jai Singh actually wanted to donate his land for free
to build the tomb for the Emperess
Historian Ira Mukhtoy tells us
that this is because the royals of Jaipur
had close relations to the Mughals
after Akbars marriage to Amers Harka Bai
Bollywood films will have us believe that
Akbars wifes name was Jodha Bai
As shown in the picture Jodha Akbar
A good film but in this instance historically incorrect
Jodha Bai literally means a Lady from Jodhpur
But it was Jahangir
who had married the daughter of Jodhpurs ruler Raja Uday Singh
His daughter was Jagat Gosain
She was Shah Jahans mother
Back then a British East India Company officer
Lt Col James Todd
wrote a book Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan
In that book he had mistakenly mentioned
Jodha Bai instead of Harka Bai
Thats why people have this confusion
that Jodha Bai was Akbars wife
Akbars wife was Harka Bai
she was Raja Maan Singhs aunt
And Raja Maan Singh was the trusted general of Akbar
Shah Jahan was Akbars grandson
and Raja Jai Singh was Raja Maan Singhs grandson
You can now understand why the two had such close relations
Raja Jai Singh and Shah Jahan
This is why Raja Jai Singh offered his land for free
he wanted to donate it to Shah Jahan
so that Shah Jahan could build a tomb for Mumtaz
But despite his offer Shah Jahan didnt accept the offer of the land for free
In exchange Shah Jahan gave four palaces to Raja Jai Singh
This transaction has been recorded in official papers as well
and it was dated as it happened
28th December 1633
You can see this record in Jaipurs City Palace now
Historian Rana Safi uploaded a copy of it with translation on Twitter

But who spread the lies?
That Raja Jai Singh had a temple there
which was then forcefully taken away by Shah Jahan?
The existence of Tejo Mahalaya a Shiv Temple
is not supported by any evidence
But the lies must have come from somewhere
That are now being repeated everywhere
The answer to this friends is one person
Purushottam Nagesh Oak
also known as PN Oak
He was the person who came up with the claim of Tejo Mahalaya
Interestingly he was not a historian
He was a history enthusiast
and enjoyed writing history as well
But he wasnt a historian
because he made up his version of history
He rewrote history
Friends the methodology of historians
is extensive and tiring
A historian has to look through old newspapers and magazines
diary entries letters
painting historical accounts of court historians
accounts of contemporary historians
accounts of travellers carbon dating
and then they have to analyse them to understand
what would have happened back then
After theyve understood it they have to write it down
and create an account by citing the various sources theyve relied on
Then their writing is peerreviewed
by other historians
to check how accurate
the account written by the historian
But PN Oaks methodology was vastly different from it
The methodology he used worked somewhat like this
Since the word Vatican sounds similar to the Sanskrit word Vatika
hed write that it was probable that Vatican had once been a Hindu temple
He didnt stop at probable he wrote it as if that was the truth
Westminster Abbey was also a Hindu temple
And Im not joking guys
These were the things written by PN Oak in his pamphlets
If you think these sound weird
he has written things way weirder than these
He had written a pamphlet on Christianity
He said that Christianity is actually ChrisnNity ideology of Hindu deity Krishna
According to him Jesus Christ had visited India
between the ages of 13 and 30 years old
and he had learned Krishnas ideologies here
And so the entirety of Christianity
is therefore inspired by Hinduism
Not only this but he also claimed that
Islam and Judaism too have come from Hinduism
Because Abraham sounds like Brahma
Abrahams wife Sarah
was probably Saraswati
Moses would be Mahesh aka Shiv
In fact according to him the entire world was ruled by an ancient Hindu empire
Coming back to the topic of the Taj Mahal
it was PN Oak who created this conspiracy theory about the Taj Mahal
In his opinion the Mughals didnt build any monuments
Initially PN Oak said that the Taj Mahal was a wonder of ancient Hinduism
built in ancient times
The historians refuted this by saying that buildings from before the 4th century
have only survived is they were made by cutting out rocks
No other buildings have survived
So this couldnt be possible
The Taj Mahal was actually built in the 1600s
After this Oak revised his claim
Then he said that it was built in the year 1155
by Raja Paramardi Dev
By the Chief Minister of the Raja Dev
When history is so close to home it doesnt take long to be revised
In 1989 he wrote another pamphlet titled
Taj Mahal The True Story
On the basis of his own pamphlet
he filed a PIL in the court in 2000 saying that
we need to know the truth behind it
Interestingly in court he had also cited that
Shah Jahan had acquired Raja Jai Singhs palace
So he took one line from actual history
and the remaining part was fabricated by him with an active imagination
To be honest PN Oak could have been a brilliant fiction author
But for some reason he chose to be a selfproclaimed historian
Supreme Court had dismissed his petition saying that
it was a misconceived notion
the Supreme Court had even ridiculed him
saying that it seemed he was bitten by a bee
And so we arrive at 2010
WhatsApp started gaining traction
The WhatsApp University began
And the fictional tales of PN Oak
turn into theories of the WhatsApp University
When these fictional stories are forwarded time and again
and reach people
People start believing them to be true accounts
and then there are fresh petitions put to our courts
And then our courts have to waste their time on such futile petitions
Interestingly after being forwarded so many times in WhatsApp University
PN Oak had talked about the year 1155
but in the latest petition filed in the court
the petitioner claimed that it was built in the year 1212
The petition talks about the history of the Taj Mahal as well
According to it Raja Paramardi Dev had built Tejo Mahalaya in 1212
But what difference does it make?
These fake theories now become topics for extended debates on TV
And then the people on TV debate as if
this is a huge mystery
As if we dont know what the truth is
When the entire truth has been repeated time and time again
Another famous claim about Shah Jahan is that
Shah Jahan had chopped off the hands of the workers
after the Taj Mahal was built
So that they couldnt build another monument like the Taj Mahal
Our Union Agricultural Minister Narendra Singh Tomar
had repeated this claim last year
saying that
the Taj Mahal was built in Agra
and the workers who built it
had their hands chopped off
But the workers working on the Vishwanath Corridor
will be welcomed with a petal shower
a new tradition was started in this country by PM Narendra Modi
If you try to think about this claim logically
you will wonder how it could have been possible
The 20000 workers who had built the Taj Mahal
were their hands chopped off on the same day?
If not were they asked to come in one by one
youre they next one to get your hands chopped off
And everyone stood in a queue waiting for their turn
It wouldnt have been possible to cut off the hands of 20000 people in a day
So they had a list of names of the workers whose hands were to be chopped off that day
and then theyd turn away those who were scheduled for another day
Asking them to adhere to the schedule
If that happened would the workers have waited in the queue
waiting for their turn to get the hands cut off?
Waiting in the queue for his turn
As soon as they would have started cutting off their hands
the others would have run away
Obviously theres zero evidence of it being true historically
Had this been true
archaeologically we would have found skeletal remains of the hands somewhere
This would have been mentioned somewhere in some book
Some court historians would have mentioned it
There were several travellers there during that era from foreign countries
they wrote books as well
something would have been mentioned somewhere at least
But there are no mentions of it
In fact the evidence that we have
are contrary to this claim
Shah Jahan had built a huge settlement
known as Taj Ganj
it still exists today
thousands of masons artisans and workers
assembled there from different regions of the empire
to work on the Taj Mahal together
The descendants of those workers
still live there and work there
and practice the skill of their forefathers
Actually after building the Taj Mahal
Shah Jahans workers built an entirely new city
It was named Shahjahanabad
Later named Delhi
So think about it logically
the Taj Mahal Red Fort Jama Masjid
were built around the same time
Had the hands of the workers being chopped off
how could the empire have built such enormous monuments?
Shah Jahans period is believed to be
the Golden Period of Mughal Architecture
it was possible only because
when Shah Jahan respected his workers
Today for many people
the Taj Mahal is a symbol of Love
Poets like Shakeel have written about it describing it as
An Emperor built the majestic Taj Mahal
and gave the world a symbol of love
On the other hand legendary poets like Sahir Ludhyanvi had written
An Emperor created a display of wealth
to ridicule the affection of the poor
Irrespective of the version of the poem that is true
today it cannot be denied
that the Taj Mahal is an architectural marvel
It is one of the official Seven Wonders of the World
and a UNESCO World Heritage Site
Indias one of the most popular tourist attractions
people from all around the world come to see it
There is no reason not to be proud of it
It is a gem of India in all aspects

whether in your WhatsApp groups or your friend or family member
repeating such baseless rumours about the Taj Mahal
do share this video with them
On 24th December 1999
Indian Airlines flight IC 814
Took off from Kathmandu
This flight was headed to Delhi
It usually takes 2 hours to fly from Kathmandu to Delhi
But the passengers and crew members on this flight
Were unaware that for them
reaching Delhi would take a much longer time
5 people hijacked this plane
These hijackers asked for 200 million
from the Indian Government  to free the passengers
They had some additional demands as well
Such as releasing some terrorists from jail
The entire country held their breath for the next 7 days
And watched this unfold on their television screens
This hijacking was the biggest hijacking in Indian history
And the last plane hijacking
Yup thats right friends
Fortunately since then no other plane has been hijacked in India
Come lets understand this entire incident in detail
24 December 1999
An Indian airplane flying from Kathmandu to Delhi
was hijacked today
The plane was carrying 11 crew members
and 179 passengers
We were blindfolded all of us with our heads down
Their safety was our first priority
We have evidence to show that hijackers
were encouraged by Pakistan
A little after this flight took off from Kathmandu
The passengers of this flight were served food
And while they were having lunch
Suddenly 4 masked men stood up
And started taking away the food
They announced that the plane had been hijacked
The hijackers went into the pilots cabin
And with Capt Devi Sharan at gunpoint
He was instructed to keep flying westwards
Actually the hijackers wanted to take this plane to Pakistan
So this plane kept flying beyond Delhi towards Pakistan
Specifically to Lahores airport
But the Pakistani air traffic controllers in Lahore
Strictly forbade the flight from landing in their territory
On the other hand the Indian air traffic controllers
came to know about this hijacking at 440 PM
And interestingly our incumbent Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
And his Principal Secretary Brajesh Mishra
came to know about this one hour later at 520 PM
At 0604 PM the Indian air traffic control
tried to establish communication with flight IC814
Capt Devi Sharan tells them that the plane was running low on fuel
And they werent permitted to land in Lahore
The captain requests the Indian air traffic control
to ask their Pakistani counterparts
To grant them permission to land in Lahore
Because the hijackers were getting frustrated
The hijackers were threatening to kill the passengers
If they werent allowed to land in Pakistan
At 630 in the evening
The Indian High Commission in Pakistan requests Pakistani authorities
To allow the plane to land in Lahore
But they werent granted permission
Meanwhile Capt Devi Sharan tried to talk to the hijackers
To tell them that the plane was running low on fuel
And that they couldnt keep waiting for permission
They had to land somewhere and refuel
He proved successful in convincing the hijackers
And the hijackers agree to have the plane land in Amritsar
For refuelling
At 644 PM the flight starts descending towards Amritsar
Friends the hijackers did not want this to happen
They had hijacked an Indian plane
And to have it land in India
Would give a huge upper hand to the Indian government and authorities
In this crisis this situation was very advantageous for India
The Indian forces could now get better control over the situation
Because the plane was about to land in India
But what happened next turned out to be a historic blunder
Subramanian Swamy describes this incident
What did the Indian authorities do wrong?
There was not one but several mistakes
At 701 PM the flight landed at Amritsar airport
Immediately they request that the flight be refuelled
Amazingly Punjabs Director General of Police
Sarabjit Singh was informed about this hijacking
1 hour earlier around 6 PM
And not through other official sources
But through the TV news
Can you imagine the scale of the communication failure here?
Such an important officer got to know about this hijacking while watching TV
After this hijacking a crisis management group was formed
And a local committee with the purpose of
delaying the plane as much as possible
This would allow more time for the commandos to develop a strategy
And to conduct some operations on the ground
But the hijackers in the plane
Refused to communicate with the local police officials
They wanted to communicate with the officials in Delhi
But this communication couldnt be effective
Captain Devi Sharan requested again to have the plane refuelled
If it wasnt refuelled the hijackers were threatening to attack the passengers
They would start killing the passengers
5 minutes passed
10 minutes 15 minutes
No refuelling was initiated
Hijackers actually attacked a person
Satnam Singh
They used a knife to injure his neck
Once again Captain Devi Sharan requested
To refuel the plane immediately
40 minutes pass like this
By 745 PM the Crisis Management Group formulates a plan
And gave orders to the Punjab Police
They decided to take advantage of the fuel tanker fuelling the plane
to hide some officers of the Punjab Police
So that they could go and puncture the tires of the plane
With damaged tires the plane would not be able to take off again
It was a good plan
But before this plan could be brought into action
The ATC came up with another plan
Why not place a fuel tanker in front of the plane
To block its way?
So a fuel tanker started moving towards the plane
But the driver of the fuel tanker was driving it a bit too fast
So the ATC was worried that the speed of the tanker
May tip off the hijackers that they were planning on doing something
So the driver was asked to drive slowly
And the driver
due to miscommunication or something else
Suddenly stopped the fuel tanker
The hijackers and the captain in the cockpit of the plane
Saw this happening
The hijackers were shocked to see this
First the tanker was moving towards them so fast
And then it stopped suddenly
They figured out something was wrong
This frustrated the hijackers
They gave up on refuelling
And wanted to take the plane back into the air
Without refuelling
Captain Sharan was pressurised into
having the plane take off
By ignoring the fuel tanker
Even if it meant hitting it
They wanted the plane to be airborne
Under pressure Captain Sharan prepared to have the plane take off
While speeding on the runway
He barely avoided hitting the fuel tanker in front of them
There was an accident almost
But it didnt happen and once again the plane was in the air
This happened exactly at 749 PM
The moment when the NSG commandos reached the airport
The operation backfired terribly
The NSG Commandos didnt get the chance to take any action
And most importantly the plane was still not refuelled
While taking off Capt Devi Sharan sent a message to the ATC
We are all dying
Lahore is just 50 km from Amritsar
Once again this flight turned towards Pakistan
Once again the ATC in Pakistan denied permission to land this plane in Lahore
They were worried that the hijackers would force the pilots to land the plane in Lahore
So all lights were turned off at Pakistans airport
All the navigational aids and lights in the airport were turned off
So that even if they wanted to land the plane
it would be exceedingly difficult without lights
But Capt Sharan was under so much pressure from the hijackers
He couldnt care whether the runway was visible or not
He had to land the plane no matter where it was
The place descended slowly
And suddenly Capt Sharan realised
That they were about to crash land on a highway
Seeing this he made a final request to Pakistans ATC
That they will crash land on the highway
If they werent allowed to land at the airport
Hearing this finally the ATC at Lahore agreed
And this plane landed in Lahore at 807 PM
India tells Pakistans Airport Officials
To prevent this plane from taking off again
India planned to send the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad
G Parthasarathy to negotiate with the hijackers
At this airport in Pakistan this plane was finally refuelled
And to prevent this plane from taking off once again
Lights were turned off once again
And their commandos surrounded the plane
Apparently the Pakistani forces tried to negotiate with the hijackers
They asked them to release the children and female passengers
But these negotiations failed
Hijackers were frustrated that their negotiations couldnt reach a solution
Their demands werent fulfilled
Another passenger was attacked
Rupin Katyal
A 25yearold man from Gurgaon
Returning with his wife from their honeymoon
Rupin passed away later
One passenger Rupin Katyal
returning from his honeymoon was brutally stabbed to death
Pakistan was tasked with providing a helicopter to the Indian High Commissioner
So that he could reach Lahore for the negotiations as quickly as possible
But the helicopter was provided 3 hours late
By the time he reached Lahore
He found that the plane had taken off once again
How was this possible when all the lights at the airport were switched off?
And the plane was surrounded by the Commandoes
How could the plane still take off?
We do not have much information about this
But we get some clues later on in the story
The flight was directed from Lahore to Oman
But even there their permission to land was rejected
The next landing of this flight was at Dubais Al Minhad Air Base
Around 300 AM
After relentless negotiation the hijackers finally released 26 passengers here
A special relief aircraft of Indian Airlines was called to Dubai
To take the passengers back to India
The then Civil Aviation Minister Sharad Yadav was present on this flight
And was accompanying the passengers to take them back to their homes safely
Some important information was revealed by the passengers returning from Dubai
about this hijacked flight
It was found that in the plane
Men were segregated from women and children
And everyone was blindfolded
So that no one could see anything
Some women claimed that the hijackers were decently behaving towards them
And were quite affectionate with the children
They said that there were 5 hijackers
And they had code names
Their leader called himself the Chief
And the four others were Burger Doctor Shankar and Bhola
Obviously these were the fake names they were using for the hijacking
But we later found that their real names were
Most of the hijackers were from Pakistan
Captain and hostages later revealed that
Hijacker Burger kept people calm on the flight
By singing making jokes and simply by talking to them
It was quite surprising that some hijackers were behaving like this
Because there were also stories of how people werent being given food
A woman claimed that her child was crying because of hunger
And the hijackers shouted at her to have the child shut up
1 day passed
The passengers in the plane were in worse conditions
Food and water were running low
The toilets were in terrible condition
The plane took off once again
And this time it flew to Afghanistan
26th December at 8 in the morning
The plane landed at Kandahar International Airport
After the landing Talibans authorities present here
Offered to mediate between the hijackers and India
Thats right at this time Taliban was in power in Afghanistan
But India didnt recognise the Talibani government
So India sent an Indian High Commissioner from Islamabad to Kandahar
To negotiate
The plane and its passengers remained there for the next 6 days
6 days
Even after everything they were trapped there for 6 days
They had no idea about what would happen next
What their future held
If theyd be killed there
The Indian government was suspicious of Talibans real intentions
Because this plane was surrounded by Talibans members
carrying weapons
Taliban claims to have taken the action against the hijackers
So that the hijackers wouldnt behave recklessly
they had placed their members all around the plane as security
But Indian analysts believe that
this was done so that India couldnt carry out military operations against the hijackers
Ajit Doval was a part of a special team
that was sent to Kandahar to negotiate with the terrorists
They claim that the hijackers were getting support from active ISI in Kandahar
That they were guaranteed to get a safe exit
They claim that without ISIs involvement
India could have better resolved this hijacking
Ajit Dovals story is very interesting on its own

Now lets return to our topic
Friends the scenario in India was very tense
It was in 1999
The year of the Kargil War
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee tried
to have peaceful relations with Pakistan
But the efforts failed
And this hijack was a sensitive issue for the Prime Ministers image
Many things are still not clear about this case
Even now we do not know
how the security was breached at Kathmandus airport
Its said that Dawood Ibrahims Nepal network was used for this
The mishandling by the Indian authorities
gave rise to a theory that Ill discuss later in this video
Getting back to our timeline now
the hijackers at Kandahar demanded 200 million
They wanted to get 165 billion
Additionally they demanded the release of 36 prisoners
Apart from this they also demanded
the dead body of Sajjad Afghani the founder of HarkatUlMujahideen
These were outrageous demands
They made high demands and asked for a lot of money
But in India the government was under different pressure
On 26th December External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh
was at a press conference regarding this hijacking
The government has been
in constant touch
with the negotiating team
Suddenly a mob of people disrupted this press conference
They were the family members and relatives of the passengers of the plane
At this press conference they ask the External Affairs minister
to fulfil the demand of the hijackers
so that their loved ones could be safe
They refer to the December 1989 incident
10 years ago when Union Minister Mufti Mohammad Saeeds daughter
Rubiya Saeed was freed after
the government released militants
They stressed the importance of civilian lives
they demanded that the government take action
to get their loved ones back into the country immediately
They believed that the safety of the passengers of the plane should be the number 1 priority
Their safety trumped all else
Whether thats a demand for the release of a prisoner
or money everything else was a second priority
Everything was happening in front of External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh
But the Indian negotiators were yet to reach Kandahar
They reached the next day on 27th December
The team of negotiators was led by Vivek Katju
He was the Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs then
And Home Ministrys official Ajit Doval
The same day the pressure on the government intensified
when the relatives of some hostages gatecrashed
into Rajiv Gandhi Bhawan
where the Crisis Management Group was in a meeting
Some people were protesting in front of the Prime Ministers residence
Taliban clearly stated that they wont allow Indian forces to conduct rescue operations
But they do offer to negotiate on behalf of India
And the negotiations went on so
Talibans leader Maulana Mohammad Umar
told a Pakistani newspaper that
the hijackers should either leave the plane
or lay down their weapons
The negotiations lasted for days
The team of Indian negotiators were placed there
with the Taliban in between them and the hijackers
Ultimately the demands of the hijackers could be narrowed down by a lot
Only 3 prisoners were to be released instead of 36
The credit for bringing down the demands of the hijackers
is given to both the Indian negotiators and Taliban
Coming back to the hijacking by the 5th day
the toilets in the plane were overflowing
People were losing hope
The RAW Chief back then A S Dulat
reached Jammu on 30th December
He tried to convince Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah
to release 2 prisoners
Farooq Abdullah was very reluctant
He argued that this would have a negative impact later on
As we see now it did
But eventually the pressure was so intense back then
That he was forced to abide by the demands
The prisoners were transported to Delhi
And were placed on a flight with External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh
Off they went to Kandahar
The next day 31st December
The demands of the hijackers were met
and 3 prisoners were released in Kandahar
On the other hand the hijackers
released the passengers of the plane
At this point in time the Indian team had expected that
the hijackers would be arrested by Taliban
But they didnt do this
Talibans supreme leader and another Talibani member
put the hijackers and the released terrorists in a vehicle
and drove towards the border
Towards Pakistans border
By this point in time it was clear to India
about Pakistans involvement in this hijacking
2 of the released persons have surfaced there
Only goes to confirm
that Pakistan is neck deep
in this dirty game of hijacking
Harkat was a Pakistanbased militant group
active in PoK
and 33 prisoners out of the 36 whose release was demanded
were Pakistanis
These hijackers safely crossed the border to reach Pakistan
On the other hand the passengers were finally safe
Several passengers were injured
and most of them were starving
On 31st December they came home
The plane that was hijacked
was retired in 2001
because it was already a 20yearold plane
The blame for this incident obviously falls on the hijackers
And the stakeholders supporting them
Whether thats Taliban or the Pakistani forces
But along with this the incumbent government
was also criticised
How terribly they failed at dealing with this crisis
When this plane was in Amritsar
it was a golden opportunity for the Indian forces
to regain control of the plane
But the big blunders committed by the government
could be labelled as a communication gap
But as a result of these blunders
the JaisheMohammad group was later formed
And we witnessed these attacks
Another shocking reveal from Amritsars controversy surfaced
The RAW Chief tells us
how among the passengers in the plane
Shashi Bhushan Singh Tomar was one of them
The brotherinlaw of N K Singh
And N K Singh was Prime Minister Vajpayees Secretary
Its said that the plane was allowed to take off from Amritsar
to ensure Tomars safety
If Tomars safety played even a minute part in Amritsars lost chance
it was a shameful act by the authorities
The other shocking thing was that
many of the top leaders of the nation came to know about the hijacking
through the TV news
Instead of their communication channels
Such as LK Advani
the then Home Minister
He says that he came to know about this incident
through the news programs
Instead of being informed by the Crisis Management Group
At the end of this story there is some good news
And its that since then
there has been no other hijacking incident in the country
The regulations and processes have been made so strict that
it has become extremely difficult to hijack any plane
What are these safety measures?
lets discuss them in detail in some future video

such as the mystery of MH370
Or Indias worst plane crash
Thank you!
The year 1945
on 5th December
at 10 past 2 in the afternoon
5 torpedo bomber aircraft of the US Navy
took off from Florida
This mission was called Flight 19
It was a 3hour long routine training mission
It wasnt anything special
they were simply flying to conduct their regular training missions
There were 14 crew members on the flight
led by their flight leader
a highly experienced pilot and war veteran
These five planes flew east from Florida
Everything was normal
the weather was clear
but about 2 hours after the takeoff
their squadron leader reported that
there were sudden problems in their compass
Their compass stopped working
They take out their backup compass
but the backup compass failed too
They cant determine their actual position
They ask the pilots of the other planes
but their instruments were malfunctioning too
Lt Charles Carol Taylor was the squadron leader
after the compass broke down
utterly confusing messages were sent over radio transmission
The weather starts worsening
At 456 in the evening
Taylor believes that their planes were flying over the Gulf of Mexico
And that they needed to fly east to get back to Florida
So he commanded the rest of the planes to fly east
But some of the crew abroad the flight believed
that they were already flying east of Florida
And that they needed to fly westwards
Right after this order
one of those planes sent a radio transmission saying
It shows that some of the crew members believed
that they had to fly westwards to get back home
But the weather continues to worsen
Its soon sunset and then the darkness of night
At this point it is believed that the planes were actually 370km east of Florida
At 704 PM
we get the last radio transmission from Taylor
After this all five planes are lost forever
Till date
we have no clue about these planes
Where are they? What happened to them?
After the disappearance of Flight 19
a SearchandRescue Mariner aircraft took off
with a crew of 13 people
They were on the mission to find Flight 19
But while looking for them they too disappear
First 14 people of Flight 19 disappeared
And then 13 people of the Mariner searchandrescue aircraft
For days after this
a large scale airandsea search operation was carried out
One of the largest search operations of the time
to look for both of these flights
But they could find nothing
Neither do they find a body of any person
nor any part of the aircraft
Everything had disappeared
the area where both planes disappeared
today we know that area as the Bermuda Triangle
We dont know which way is West
Over the past 50 years
3000 ships
and 100 planes
have gone missing in a mysterious stretch of water
in the Atlantic Ocean
Ships have gone missing
planes have gone missing
Known as the Devils Triangle
a source of intrigue
legend and fear
this is the Bermuda Triangle
The Bermuda Triangle is said to be
a very mysterious part of the ocean
There more than 100 aircraft and ships have disappeared
They were never found again
This area lies between Florida in the USA
Puerto Rico and the country Bermuda in the North
It makes a triangular area like this
Overall this area spans more than 500000 square miles
Tales of the Bermuda Triangle are older than 500 years
In 1492
when Christopher Columbus set out to find the New World
he reported that when he was passing by this area
his compass stopped working
And one night when he looked at the sky from his ship
he saw a weird light
A strange light that looked like a ball of fire
And he saw that ball of fire fall out of the sky into the ocean
This was the beginning of the mystery
over the next few eras several names were given to this area
The Graveyard of the Atlantic
The Sea of Doom
Sargasso Graveyard
These names were used in the 18th and 19th centuries
But the name the Bermuda Triangle
was used for the first time in 1964
In a magazine called Argosy
there was an article by Vincent H Gaddis in 1964
titled The Deadly Bermuda Triangle
This was the first time the phrase Bermuda Triangle was used
In this article
many disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle over the last several decades
were summarised by him
He had tried to link them all
Trying to create a mystery
Claiming that there is something peculiar in this area of the ocean
because of which so many aircraft and ships disappear
Although there were no explanations in the article as to why it happened
But this made the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle the most popular at the time
So popular that many books were written on it
Many films and computer games were made
there were songs on the Bermuda Triangle too
Talking about some other incidents
there was another horrifying incident in the year 1918
It involved the USS Cyclops
One of the biggest and fastest ships of the US Navy at the time
It was a very important asset for the American Navy
Especially when America began taking part in World War I
It was used to transport the troops and coal
On 4th March 1918
306 people were aboard the USS Cyclops
From a city near Washington called the West Indies Baltimore
this ship began its journey towards Brazil
Other than people this ship was carrying 11000 tonnes of manganese
The journey was supposed to take 9 days
Everything was fine with the departure of the ship
The weather was clear
While departing the ships send the message
But this message
was the last message from this ship
After this ship began its journey
there was no news from it
It had disappeared suddenly
This shocked everyone
One of the biggest ships of the US Navy
a ship this huge
how could it disappear suddenly?
If you think that this incident was mysterious
a more daunting and frightful incident
was the Ellen Austin mystery
In the year 1881
a 210 feet long ship
the Ellen Austin
Travelling from London to New York
quite common for the day
many ships undertook this journey at the time
But on its way Ellen Austin encountered an unidentified ship
Near the Bermuda Triangle area
From the outside this unidentified ship looked completely normal
but there was no trace of any humans aboard this ship
There was no crew no people at all
The captain of Ellen Austin decided to
go aboard the ship to see what had happened
First he brought his ship alongside this ship and waited for 2 days
so that they could see if there was anyone or even a trace of anyone
for any response from the other ship
But there was no response for 2 days
After that the captain set foot on the unidentified ship
There was a lot of stuff on this new ship
And everything was in the place it should have been
During that time people were wary of pirates
they used to be wary of an attack by the pirates
who would steal from the ships
This unidentified ship hadnt been subjected to this
Because all the valuable items of this ship were intact
Due to this reason the captain of Ellen Austin decided to
send some of his crew members on the ship
and that they would continue their journey with both ships
For the first 2 days both ships continued ahead normally
But then came a storm
Their paths separated
and the unidentified ship had disappeared
After the storm was over
the captain of the Ellen Austin tried to look for the ship
and he spotted the ship with this spyglass at some distance
When he reached near it
there was again no trace of any human aboard the ship
The crew members he had sent from his ship to the other ship
they had suddenly disappeared
Where did they go? What happened to them?
We dont know
But the ship was still intact
Its said that the captain of Ellen Austin tried once again to bring the ship with him
and sent some more crew members to steer the ship
but again after a few days there was another storm
and the same story repeated again
This unidentified ship gets separated
and the new crew members on it disappear once again
When Ellen Austin returned
the owner of the ship was so terrified after hearing this story
that he sold off the ship to a German company
They change the name of this ship to Meta
Yup thats right
the way that Mark Zuckerberg renamed Facebook into Meta
this ship too was renamed Meta
Isnt it an intriguing and legendary story?
But unfortunately friends
most probably this incident is just a story
Because this incident is so old
it is not possible to verify it properly
And the stories that are very popular historically
those that are passed down to generations
but that cannot be verified properly
the truth cannot be unearthed
we call those stories Legends
Urban Legends
Many rational thinkers believe
that the Bermuda Triangle is one such legend
What lies behind the incidents of the Bermuda Triangle?
There are many theories for it
Some people blame the aliens
that aliens had come and abducted the aircraft and ships
and had taken these with them
Some people believe that there is a giant sea monster under the ocean
that is behind the disappearances
Some people claim that this area of the ocean is peculiar
and the aircraft and vessels drown here
These theories are truly outlandish
So lets focus on the theories that
sound a bit more scientific
One of the explanations is based on magnetism
the North Pole of the Earth
and the magnetic North Pole
are two distinct points
So when you look towards North on a compass
the compass is pointing towards the magnetic North Pole
But the real North Pole
is somewhere close by
It is known as the Geographic North Pole
You can see it in this photo
The difference between the Magnetic and Geographic North Poles
Normally when people use the compass
as has been done for ages
they take this into account
But there are some areas on the Earth
if you use a compass in these areas
you would find the Magnetic and Geographic North Poles at the same place
The places where this happens are known as
the Agonic Lines
These Agonic Lines shift with time
But for the last 200300 years
the 0 line has been around or in the area of the Bermuda Triangle
This can basically create confusion
The next strange thing about this area is that
the area in the Bermuda Triangle
is quite shallow
When you look at it on a satellite map
youd see that the Bahamas
Caribbean Islands
theyre surrounded by turquoise colour all around
This area in the ocean stretches across a long distance
with shallow waters
You can see the deep ocean around it
is represented in dark blue colour
and this area stands out when looked at through a satellite
Because of this it is said that
in the olden days when the ships came to this area
got stuck here due to shallow waters
Hidden shoals were the points where the land beneath the ocean was quite high
But it was not visible from the ships
When the ships were atop the area
they would get stuck there
The third peculiarity
this area has one of the highest rates of hurricanes in the world
If you rank the countries where most of the hurricanes are seen
China is at Number 1
then the USA at Number 2 followed by Cuba
Cuba lies in this area
And which state gets the most hurricanes in the USA?
It lies in this area
This area gets hurricanes and water sprouts more frequently
Methane Hydrates is the fourth explanation
There are some areas in the ocean
that have large fields of methane hydrates
In Australia scientists had conducted laboratory experiments
in which they had found that
when theres an exceeding amount of methane bubbles in the water
the density of the water gets lower
and the buoyancy of a ship cannot be maintained
and so the ship drowns
Its the same logic as when
the salt content of the water is high
the density of water increases
and it becomes easier for things to float
As is the case of the Dead Sea
If you recall I had made a vlog there
A normal person who would sink into the ocean
floats on the Dead Sea
because the density of the water is high
The same thing is happening here in reverse
If there is methane in the water
It is hypothesised
if there are methane eruptions in the water
they are also known as mud volcanoes
when volcanoes erupt underwater methane is released
and if it happens when a ship is over the area
then the ship would instantly sink into the water
without any warnings
Never to be heard from again
This is an interesting explanation
But in all the disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle
there was no direct evidence
that any exact incident was due to methane hydrates
This is simply a scientifically proven thing that exists
But to have actually caused the disappearance of any ship
has not been proven yet
The fifth explanation is the most important in my opinion
Because this is related to human psychology
This is known as the
BaaderMeinhof Effect
Or the Frequency Illusion
The BaaderMeinhof Effect or the Frequency Illusion is a psychological effect
It states that when we start to notice things more
then we start finding them more often around us
Remember when someone in your family bought a new car?
The model of the car you got
after buying it you would have noticed
that over the next few days or even months
whenever you were on the road
you started noticing the model of the car you bought more and more
You would notice the same model on the road
You may also feel like more people bought the model after you bought it
In reality the frequency of the car on the road didnt change much
It was just as common after you bought it as it was before
But because you bought the car
you started noticing it more
The same thing is said about the Bermuda Triangle
Though it is true that some big aircraft and vessels disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle
But if youve noticed
in many areas around the world across all oceans
there have been such disappearances of aircraft and ships
areas other than the Bermuda Triangle
One of the recent examples of this is the Malaysian Airlines flight
It hadnt disappeared around the Bermuda Triangle
The thing is that when people came across the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle
people started paying more attention to the disappearances and incidents there
The incidents taking place around the Bermuda Triangle
And the similar incidents that took place outside the Bermuda Triangle
people didnt pay much attention to them
Journalist Larry Kusche
the author of the book The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved
reached this solution too
He wrote that though there were some incidents that took place initially
but when with time when the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle gained prominence
some people started creating their stories
There was mysterymongering
and some stories were totally absurd
and hadnt really happened
The story of Ellen Austin that I told you
is said to be one such fabrication
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration of the US state that
theres no evidence that the aircraft and ships that disappear in the Bermuda Triangle
the mysterious disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle that we see
no evidence that they occur more frequently in the Bermuda Triangle
than compared to any other area of the ocean
It is not so
We see similar mysterious disappearances
in the other areas of the oceans as well
The United States Coast Guards have even said that
It shows that the Coast Guard of the USA dont even recognise
the Bermuda Triangle is a hazardous area
They said that the fact that the area within the Bermuda Triangle
is heavily trafficked
could account for some of the mystery
The area of the Bermuda Triangle
sees a lot of traffic of ships and aeroplanes
thats why the chances of such incidents happening here increase
Pair that with the fact that the
Bermuda Triangle is often swept by hurricanes
and the presence of the Gulf Stream
it is not hard to see why ships might
occasionally sink there
If you bear in mind that this area sees a lot of hurricanes
and the water is shallow here
you arrive at the straightforward answer to the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle
But despite the frequent hurricanes
when WWF had conducted their detailed study in 2013
for the Worlds 10 Most Dangerous Bodies of Water for Shipping
in the top 10 most dangerous waters
the Bermuda Triangle area was not on the list
Simply speaking
the mysterious disappearances have nothing to do with the Bermuda Triangle
You might ask now
what was the ball of fire that Christopher Columbus had seen fall into the ocean?
Theres a simple and scientific answer to it too
Scientists believe that it was actually a meteor
seen by Christopher Columbus
28th June 1914
A 19yearold student at a school
assassinates the AustroHungarian Prince
And this one incident
triggered the war
A war that lasted four years
In which more than 20 million people lost their lives
A war in which several ancient empires came to an end
A war that was fought across multiple countries and continents
Today we know of this war as the World War I
Doesnt it sound very sensational?
Because of this one single event
World War I broke across the world
If we could go back to the past in a time machine
and if we could prevent this assassination
would there be no World Wars in the world?
The reality isnt this simple friends
When theres a large scale war like this
there is a long and complex chain of reasons driving it
And then theres one such incident that causes a spark
Imagine if theres a mountain of dynamites here
And I use a small matchstick to blow up the entire mountain
the following blast would not be because of my matchstick
there was a mountain of dynamite there
thats why it happened
Come in todays video
lets understand World War I
January 1916
140000 men were assembling for the attack
In the year 1914
Europe looked like this on a map
There was an Austro Hungarian empire in the middle
the empire was much bigger than the present size of the countries Austria and Hungary
Germanys empire was also much bigger than presentday Germany
Poland wasnt a country
There was the Russian Empire in Russia
There was the Ottoman Empire in presentday Turkey
Apart from these there was the United Kingdom and France
Its interesting to know friends
most of the European countries were monarchies at the time
There were rulers in those places
In fact there were only 3 European countries
that were Democracies rather than monarchies
France Switzerland and San Marino
There are some countries in Eastern Europe
such as Serbia Bosnia Romania and Bulgaria
collectively called the Balkan Countries
Dont forget them theyre very important for our story
We will begin our story from the year 1878
There was a war between the Russian empire and the Ottoman empire
Ottoman empire was on one side
and the Russian empire on the other
helping the Balkan countries separate from the Ottoman empire
At the conclusion of the war
the Treaty of Berlin was signed in 1878
According to this treaty
the Austro Hungarian empire was given the right
to administer the region of BosniaHerzegovina
But the area would officially be a part of the Ottoman empire
But in October 1908
the Austro Hungarian empire annexed BosniaHerzegovina
Invaded there
This political caricature from then is very interesting
The Ottoman Sultan with his folded hands is feeling helpless
Because of the internal problems in the Ottoman empire
There were internal revolutions
During this time Bulgaria successfully separated from the Ottoman empire
represented as the independent state in the middle
On the left you can see the Austrian emperor Franz Josef
is trying to steal BosniaHerzegovina
He is ripping it out of the map to steal it
The region of BosniaHerzegovina
was under the Ottoman empire for 400 years
but instead of getting independence
another empire came in and captured them
Obviously the people of Bosnia were enraged at this
They wanted freedom
People in the neighbouring country Serbia were also infuriated at seeing this happen
The Serbians didnt only have a geographical connection with the Bosnians
they even had an ethnic connection
Actually all the Eastern European countries
have the ethnicity of Slavs
Many people living in these countries feel this connection
In fact if you look at the bottom of the map
the countries in dark blue
the people in these countries call themselves South Slavs
Many people in these countries
even demanded a South Slavic Nation
Serbia complained that
the Austro Hungary empire
wasnt merely invading Bosnia
rather they were invading the South Slavs
Before capturing the country the foreign minister of AustriaHungary
had already spoken with the Russian foreign minister
asking Russia to refrain from objecting to it
as they were giving them prior intimation of their capture
And Russia agreed to them
Because Russia wanted something in return
Look at this map this is the Black Sea
and the Sea of Marmar is in the South
the Strait of Bosphorus joins the two
And dividing Istanbul into 2
This part belonged to the Ottoman empire
And Russia wanted to have this
So Russia told the AustroHungarian empire
that Russia would annex the region
And so they shouldnt oppose them
And Russia wouldnt say anything either when they capture Bosnia
A good deal
But there was a problem
The problem was that many Slavic people lived in Russia
And many Russians started protesting the invasion of Bosnia
How could they agree to the AustroHungarian empire
getting control of Slavic people?
The Russian empire was already weak
It had to abide by the wishes of the people
So despite the secret agreement
the Russian foreign minister
started supporting Serbia
It was 1909
the AustroHungarian empire turned towards Germany and asks them
if they capture Serbia
and Russia comes to interfere
would Germany help the AustroHungarian empire?
Germany agrees to help them as they were old friends
Theyd definitely help
On the other hand Russia asks France
AustroHungarian empire had first invaded Bosnia
and when Serbia objected to it
the AustroHungarian empire and Germany
had joined forces to attack Serbia
Russia proposed that France should join its forces with Russia to fight against them
But France replies that
it has nothing to do with Bosnia
regardless of what happened they didnt want to interfere in the matter
Frances refusal silenced Russia
And it had to accept the annexation of Bosnia
With this
the threat of a war
the threat of World War ensuing
But then comes the assassination of Ferdinand
the Bosnians that were annexed
the Bosnians didnt accept that meekly
The Bosnians wanted freedom
A new revolutionary movement had begun
It is named the Young Bosnia
It was a revolutionary group of students
And the Serbians were helping them
They aimed to build an independent country
In fact not only did they aim to free BosniaHerzegovina
but also to unite with Serbia
They wanted to build a United South Slavic nation
What a beautiful name Yugoslavia
Yugo means South
An apt term for a South Slavic country
Spoiler alert it did become a reality later on
Although by now the country has broken apart too
But anyway on 28th June 1914
the prince of AustroHungary Ferdinand
with his wife Sophie went to visit the annexed territory in Bosnia
They wanted to travel through the newly acquired territory
but soon that cause much suffering to them
Six Bosnian revolutionaries planned to assassinate them
Around 10 in the morning
a revolutionary named Cabrinovic
threw a bomb near Ferdinands car
But the bomb bounced on the car and blew up in a side street
Injuring 20 people
Ferdinand escaped this
The meeting he was headed to was then cancelled because of the shock
and tells the Bosnian mayor that
They decided to cancel the program and go to the hospital
To meet the injured people
On the way to the hospital
their car takes a wrong turn mistakenly
When they tried to get back to the correct route
they realised that actually
they were a mere 5 feet away from a revolutionary
A 19yearold school student
Gavrilo Princip
I talked about him at the beginning of the video
This was the person to shoot at Ferdinand and his wife Sophie
And so assassinated the prince of the AustroHungarian empire
Gavrilo Princip was arrested immediately
but he was 2 months short of 20 years
and so according to the law he couldnt be given the death sentence
Gavrilo was sentenced to 20 years in jail for this assassination
During the trial he said that
he was a Yugoslav Nationalist
That he aimed to unite the yugo slavs
But it didnt matter to him which state would Yugoslav be a part of
But during the trials he wanted that
Bosnia should be free from Austria
The emperor of the AustroHungarian empire is enraged at the assassination
In his anger
the declares war on Serbia
Russia sees this as an attempt to annex Serbia
And so Russia went to save Serbia
Germany saw that Russia was taking arms against the AustroHungarian empire
And so Germany went to save the AustroHungarian empire
This time France doesnt stay behind
France reached there in support of Russia and Serbia
This created an interesting chain
called the Chain of Friendship
This is an interesting caricature
drawn to describe the situation
Italy was in alliance with AustriaHungary and Germany
But Italy reneges on the agreement to support the two
Because the agreement stated that in case of an attack on their country
the others would help them
But it was AustriaHungary and Germany that were invading Serbia
They started the attacks
So Italy claimed that they werent bound to help
But because the Ottoman empire had enmity with Russia
the Ottoman empire reached in support of the AustroHungarian empire
The United Kingdom gets involved in this too
Because Russia France and Britain had an alliance treaty called the Triple Entente
This was how
the Great war ensued
In which all these countries were at war with each other
Later countries like the USA and Japan
join this war in support of Britain and France
And obviously the countries that were under British rule
like India
gets involved in this war
Because the British needed soldiers
And the easiest option was to
use the people of the countries Britain had colonised as soldiers
Many Indians went to participate in World War I on behalf of Britain
Friends this was how World War I began
But a pertinent question arises here
why were all these countries so eager to go on a war against each other?
If something like this happens today
so many countries wouldnt get into the war
What was so different then?
That these countries readily went to war
Friends its said that there were four main reasons for it
Friends here Nationalism means
a nationalism without liberation
A nationalism without independence
A nationalism that was based on race
On the belief that their country is the best in the world
And to have an aggressive attitude against the other countries
Looking at other countries as inferiors
Bismark had united Germany in 1871
on the basis of nationalism
But Germany was still a constitutional monarchy
Under the Prussian monarchy
The kings and emperors took advantage of this nationalism among people
They convinced people to go on a war for their country
And they declared war for Imperialism
To capture and occupy the other countries
You might think that it is so difficult to manage ones own country
why would these people want to expand the borders of their countries?
Why did they want to invade other countries?
Causing them a greater administrative headache
Friends the simple answer to this is
The kings and emperors annexed other countries
for their pride
to gain power
by comparing the sizes of their empires
and to exploit the resources in those areas
If gold was found somewhere theyd loot it
To keep it in their treasury
By the 1900s
this process of looting
was carried on by Capitalist countries too
Like the East India Company
It was the East India Company that had first captured areas in India
and started draining Indias wealth
Thats why many people call Imperialism the highest stage of capitalism
Capitalists capture other countries
exploit the raw material and cheap labour there
to earn more profit
A famous capitalist of the time
Henry Ford the founder of the Ford company
gave a famous statement on war and capitalism
There are numerous interesting things to know about World War I
but if I start telling you all of them
this video would be hours long
If you want to know the details of the War
Id definitely ask you to
to listen to the World War I summary on KUKU FM
This is a book summary over 2hours long
It is very interesting
For those of you who do not know about KUKU FM
it is a brilliant audio learning platform
On it you would get many such informative audiobooks and biographies
The cost to access the entire platform
is normally 399 for the year
But because KUKU FM has sponsored this video
It would cost you only 199 per year
It means that you can access their entire library for a year at the cost of one movie ticket
Friends this imperialism
wasnt possible without militarism
The countries had to spend a lot of money on their military
So that they could invade more countries
simply by brute force
The Royal Navy of the British
was the largest navy in the world then
With its help Britain could run their large imperialistic empire
The six great powers of the time
Britain France Germany
AustriaHungary Russia and Italy
had combined military spending of around 94 million in 1870
And by 1914
it had increased to four times this
All of these countries were spending a lot of money
on military
These countries were greatly interested in imperialism
Of capturing as many countries as possible
To extend their empire
Friends the most interesting thing was that
when I talk about a country here
by country I mostly mean the monarch of the country
The ruler of the empire
Because there werent democracies
They paid no heed to the peoples opinions
The wishes of the one at the top ran the country
And the monarchs were very ruthless
Kaiser Wilhelm II was the ruler of Germany then
He is believed to be a hottempered ruler
He was always worried about an attack on Germany by France Britain or Russia
In Russia Tsar Nicholas II was having trouble maintaining his position
He was the last emperor of the Russian Empire
And Britains HeadofState was King George V
Wanna know an interesting fact?
These three rulers were first cousins of each other
They literally belonged to the same family
The rulers of 3 countries
Can you imagine that?
World War I was literally a Game of Thrones
You can think of this as a family feud
It is said that Queen Victoria had tried to get them to stop the war
but after her death
it couldnt be possible
The fourth reason cited here was the Alliances
There were many political alliances in force among these countries
The Triple Alliance was formed in 1882
among Germany the AustroHungarian Empire and Italy
These three countries had promised mutual support to each other
if any of the Great Powers were attacked
The second major alliance was formed in 1907
called the Triple Entente
Among Great Britain France and Russia
The original reason behind forming these alliances was Imperialism
Since the countries were trying to capture the other countries
theyd later feel jealous when some other country captured more countries
They were constantly worried that if such and such country captured any particular region
they would need to capture more to protect themselves
This was all they did
In this case how did the commoners fare?
Why would the commoners fight among themselves for their rulers?
Did the people want World War I?
Friends the answer to this is mostly no
But the commoners were still pushed into the war
The first reason was that the job of the soldier then
was for the poor
A common man would become a soldier put his life at risk
for the greed of a ruler
Why would someone want to do this?
To earn money
For the lack of employment
The people that couldnt get employed anywhere else
looked for jobs as soldiers in these countries
It is a different matter to fight a war for to protect ones country
but to capture another country
to invade another country
why would anyone want to fight in a war?
From where would they get the motivation?
The answer to this is the propaganda that used to be spread then
Lingoistic Nationalism
The newspapers and media at the time
created an image
that to enlist oneself in the army
was a noble profession
Labelling it as a selfless service for the country
Soldiers were shown as gentlemen disciplined heroes
The media started glorifying War
For example Britain had gone on the Crimean War against Russia once
and because of a failed military action
200 British soldiers were killed
But the newspaper exaggerated it so much to highlight it
and the article that was printed in The Times London
Even though the top leadership made horrible decisions in the battle
due to which soldiers had to lose their lives
it was still shown as a heroic act
The monarch of Britain
appointed an official poet
Alfred Tennyson
He wrote the poem The Charge of The Light Brigade
This was one of the first poems in the world
that showed a soldier as a hero
Another famous English poet Rupert Brooke
his poems The Soldier The Dead
portrayed war and death as glorious things
He lost his life in World War I
And Winston Churchill used his poem as a death note
to recruit more people
This was the type of was mongering propaganda that was spread then
It was shown that going on a war for your country was a great act
Im putting quotes on country here
because there wasnt a democratic country there
The country referred to the rule of the emperor
And you were basically going on a war for the ruler
But not everyone fell under the influence of the propaganda
There were many people in these countries who were completely against the war
Americas Socialist Party the Italian Socialist Party
British Labour Party Russias Bolsheviks
Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg in Germany
Apart from them there were many other groups of people
Like the Anarchists and Syndicalists
who believed in Internationalism
Some people opposed the war on the basis of religion and humanity
Like Henry Ford and Valentine Bulgakov
Additionally there were poets and intellectuals like Rudyard Kipling as well
against the War
Youd recognise him as the author of the Jungle Book
Against the poem The Charge of The Light Brigade
he wrote a counter poem
The Last of The Light Brigade
It highlights the inhumane conditions that a soldier has to go through
while fighting in a war
Similarly there were poems by Wilfred Owen
that showed the bitter truth of the war
Poisonous fumes
wounded limbs
coughing blood
if you can truly understand the conditions that a soldier has to go through in war
then you would never look at war with enthusiasm
Perhaps the most legendary antiwar poem was written by Thomas Hardy in 1909
The Man He Killed
In this poem
he focuses on a soldier that has killed another soldier
because both were unemployed
they had no work
driven by the need to earn money for their family
they enlisted as soldiers
fought for their country
looked at each other and shot at one another
But had the same two people met each other in a restaurant in one of their countries
perhaps they would have merrily sang together and dined
and revelled together
These are the reasons friends that
every soldier that fought in World War I
did not come under the influence of the terrible war mongering
and we witnessed several cases of mutinies
There was a case in France where
an entire battalion
gave up their arms because they didnt want to fight in the war
In Russia the soldiers waged a war against their rulers
But the Christmas Truce of 1914 was the most interesting case
While the war was going on in 1914
come Christmas
the British and German soldiers came together
to celebrate Christmas on the battlefield
They exchanged food
sang together
and celebrated together
Because these common folks literally had no reason to fight in this war
But then their commanders ordered them to stop celebrating
and to continue with the war
They started punishing the soldiers
if they refused to fight
they would be shot down by their own troops
If someone deserts from the battles
they would be punished when caught
The soldiers were given such punishments by the country they were fighting for
To force them to fight in the war
Eventually World War I happened
and what exactly happened then lets talk about that in some future video
In part 2 of this video lets talk about
the countries that fought in World War II and the countries that won
And Indias involvement in this geopolitical game
I hope you found the video informative
If you liked it watch the video on Kargil War too
And I have made several videos on such historical education
you can watch all of them on this playlist here
Formula 1 racing is a sport which saw a boost in popularity recently
It is one of the most dangerous sports in the world
While driving the F1 cars
The temperature is normally at 45C for the driver
And can go up to 60C
Theres so much heat and humidity that in a normal race
The F1 driver loses about 23 kg in weight
Simply by completing a race
Because they sweat so much
And also during the way
I lose up to 4 kilos in a race in an hour and 45 minutes
But this is because it gets so hot isnt it?
So if youre in Singapore or Malaysia or something
Yeah those ones are killer
The cars are driven at such high speeds
That at every turn the driver has to bear high G forces
Up to 6 Gs
Come in todays video lets understand
How this game actually works
What is its BillionDollar Business Model?
And should it even be considered a sport?
Formula 1 is the most exciting sport on the planet!
Grand Prix!
F1 is all about pushing the limits of speed
science and nerves
Friends Formula 1 originated in France
In 1906 a race was held
It was called the French Grand Prix
These words should sound like rnd prks
But since its a French term
Its pronounced as grahn pri
It literally means the Great Prize
Since then the name Grand Prix continued
And till now during Formula 1 racing
This name is used
Back then car races did not test the speed of the driver
Rather they focused on the endurance of the driver
Literally the race would stretch from one city to another on normal roads
In fact the first Grand Prix race lasted 24 hours
And was held in Le Mans
If you have watched the film Ford v Ferrari
It was based on this race
In 1904 an international association was established
It is now known as FiA
Fdration Internationale de lAutomobile
This is the governing body of Formula 1 FiA
Similar to FIFA for football
And ICC for cricket
It was only after 1946
That professional racing began to be conducted in an organised manner
Some rules were drafted in 1947
known as the Formulas
The duration of the races
The types of cars that could be used for the races
That the racing cars should be a single seater
That it should be an open wheel
Open wheel means that the wheels of the car extend outwards from its body
Today a typical Formula 1 race car looks like this
But before we get to the car
Lets get to the Formula 1 Championship
The first season of the World Championship was announced in 1950
A championship with 7 races across 7 countries
This first Championship was won by an Italian driver
driving for the Alfa Romeo team
Friends now in the 2023 Championship season
There will be 23 races
If the names of the team seem familiar
Its because most of the teams in Formula 1 racing
Are car manufacturers
Friends here comes the most unique aspect of Formula 1 racing
Winning a Formula 1 Championship
doesnt depend solely on the skill of the driver
On how well the driver can drive
But it also depends on how well the car was made
This game is a competition of technology as well
To see who can manufacture the fastest car
This is why several car manufacturers
Participate in Formula 1 Championship
Other than the publicity of these companies
Another benefit to them is that
When new technologies would be innovated during Formula 1
Those technologies can be later used for manufacturing consumer cars
The cars commonly sold to average people can also be improved
Friends there are several examples of this
Technologies that are nowadays used in most common cars
That were first discovered during F1
For example Carbon Fibre
A material that is used in BMW Aston Martin and Porsche cars now
It was used for the first time in 1981 by McLaren in Formula 1
The first company to build a car chassis with this material
This was an expensive but light material
It improved fuel efficiency
Some other examples of such technology are
Using Hybrid Powertrains and Wheel Buttons
The rules of the competition force the companies to
innovate even the tiniest aspect
So that the cars can be as fast as possible
The current world record for the fastest speed is 3725 kmhr
This happened during a race in Mexico in 2016
This speed record is held by Valtteri Bottas
But other than in an actual race
The full potential of an F1 car was seen in 2005
When Hondas team achieved 3977 kmhr
This was for the purpose of the record test
This test was conducted in a very special place
A dry lake bed where for kilometres around
Theres only a plain field like this
But normally the speed of the F1 cars is so high that
It is faster than the takeoff speed of an airplane
When a large airplane takes off
Its speed is around 250 kmhr
Friends do you know what this means?
Had there been wings on these cars
These cars wouldve flown
Even without wings they could easily take off
This is the reason for the peculiar shape at the back of the cars
These are wings to counter the wings that planes have
In school you wouldve studied that the shape of the wings of an airplane
Aims to create a lift
High pressure and low pressure on either side
Allowing the plane to take off
In the F1 cars its the opposite
It creates a negative lift
So that the cars can be pushed onto the track
The downforce produced is equal to 5G
A force of 5 times the weight of the car
Pushes it downwards
This provides traction to the tires
enabling them to execute sharp turns
That Formula 1 is an extremely dangerous sport
It is believed to be one of the most dangerous sports in the world
When driving in daytoday life has turned so dangerous
With the high chances of a person dying in a car accident
This is such a high speed sport
Obviously this would have an added danger
In total 52 drivers have died since Formula 1 racing began
The most famous accident was of
The threetime champion Ayrton Sennas death in 1994
In 1970 one driver died
And was posthumously awarded the championship
This happened for the Austrian driver Jochen Rindt
Simply because drivers accumulate points over different races
Even after Rindts death no driver could
catch up to his accumulated points in that season
So he was given the winners trophy after his death
But specifically speaking
several steps are taken to ensure safety during Formula 1 races
Obviously the first is providing helmets by the companies compulsorily
These are stronger than normal helmets
They have carbonfibre head and neck support
So that the vertebrate of a driver can be protected in case of any crash
Additionally the suit that the drivers wear
Is made of multilayered fireproof material
In case the car catches fire in an accident
At least their clothes wont catch fire
Drivers are equipped with biometric gloves
The gloves are fitted with sensors that
constantly measure and transmit vitals such as heartbeats to medical staff
The seatbelts in the car are so tight that
The help of another person is required
To fasten the seatbelt
There are fire extinguishers in the cars too
but the most groundbreaking innovation in terms of safety was in 2018
when this Halo was introduced
Halo is basically a steel bar
that is placed above the head in these cars
It is made of Grade 5 Titanium
Its purpose is to protect the drivers head in case the car is upturned
When this was introduced in 2018
this angered several people
they were infuriated because the cars wouldnt have an open cockpit anymore
They claimed that it looked ugly
and was an unnecessary addition
But since then it has been 45 years
this innovation has saved the lives of many drivers
The Halo is the strongest part of an F1 car
It is strong enough to sustain the weight of 2 African elephants on top of it
So yeah such safety innovations took place in recent times
to make the sport safer
These F1 cars are truly engineering marvels
Years of knowledge accumulated
to craft these to perfection
Friends this is why today for a new company
it is so difficult to enter this business
Money isnt the only factor
This requires years of knowledge and persistence

Lets talk about the Business Model
How does the financial aspect work?
2 types of companies are involved in Formula 1 racing
The constructor companies that make cars
And the engine manufacturer companies
that make engines
Presently there are about 10 constructor companies namely Alpha Romeo
Alphatauri Alpine Astin Martin
Ferrari Haas McLaren
Mercedes Red Bull and Williams
But only 4 companies manufacture engines
Ferrari Mercedes Renault and Honda
Ferraris team is the most successful team in the history of Formula 1
They have won 16 constructor titles and 15 driver titles
A point to note here is that
in a Formula 1 Championship
theres a winning driver and a winning constructor
Each team has 2 drivers
A team can be a constructor champion
by taking into account the performance of both drivers
But a driver championship can be won
when a driver gets the most points at an individual level
Since the make of the car plays such an important role
some people argue that more than the skills of the driver
the construction of the car is more important for winning a race
So often it so happens that
the best drivers do not win as many championships
For example many F1 fans believe that
Fernando Alonso has been the best driver in the history of F1
In terms of technique
But he has won only 2 championships
In 2005 and 2006 with Renault
Since the construction of the car plays such an important role in this game
it means that a large amount of money is involved here
To some extent the team with more money
could use better technology and strategies for their cars
But its interesting to see that
it is a risky business for companies to participate in Formula 1
Lets look at the financials of Red Bull
This team has recently won a Constructor Championship
and the winning drivers were from this team as well
In 2018 their sister team Toro Rosso
spend 1811 million in total
Its around 15 billion
And their revenue was at 1836 million
Their spending and earnings
had a minute difference
Their profit was only 18 million
Only 150 million after taxes
Its very little profit considering the money being spent here
And this was a toplevel team
The companies believe that the return on investment theyd get
from other sources would be much better
Such as publicity and the progress in technology
In 2022 FiA placed a cap on the budget
140 million
No team can spend more than this
So that theres some equality in the competition
This year in 2023 this cap has been lowered to
135 million
The salary of the drivers are paid by the teams
but that is kept outside the budget cap restrictions
So theres no limit to the salary paid to the drivers
It means that similar to other sports
theres a large inequality in the salaries paid to the drivers
Some premium drivers toplevel drivers
are paid much higher salaries than others
Such as Max Verstappen
He has been the Driver Champion for the last 2 years
Its estimated that last year
he was paid around 60 million in the year
Compare it to Mick Schumachers salary
who was paid only 1 million for the same year
Obviously the salary depends on several things
Other than the drivers success
it is also dependent on the team for which the driver is driving
the level it is at and how much money it has
Mick Schumacher races for the Haas team
that is still growing
Presently though there are no Indian teams in Formula 1 racing
but there is an Indian connection to the F1
Till now we had 2 Indian drivers
Narain Karthikeyan
And Karun Chandhok
They drove and participated in the Championship for 3 years and 2 years respectively
But perhaps a better highlight for India was that
India had a team in Formula 1
Force India
The team was created in 1991
when it was known as Spyker F1
Under different ownership
but in 2007 Vijaya Mallya and Michiel Mol director of the team bought it
And its name was changed to Force India
It debuted in 2008
The same year the expenses of this team
rose by 744
The biggest increase till date
Back then the primary sponsors of the team were Kingfisher
RIL and ICICI bank
In 2011 Sahara India Pariwar bought 425 shares of this team
Mallya was left with 425  and Michiel Mol with 15 shares
And so the team was renamed again
to Sahara Force India
Friends in its short career this team wasnt very successful
but with time it was definitely improving
The drivers were showing promise
In fact even this year 3 drivers from that team would be racing
Nice Hulkenberg for Haas
Sergio Perez for Red Bull
And Esteban Ocon for Alpine
Till 2017 the Force India team improved year after year
Each season their performance was better than the last
2017 was the best year
when Perez and Ocon were their drivers
In 201617 their ranking was in 4th place
Thats not bad
It had become a midlevel team
And then came 2018 when its downfall began
The thing is each year theres a summer break in Formula 1
It is usually 2 weeks long
That year in July 2018
just before the summer break
documents were released as to how this company
had only 315000 in the bank
While it had taken out loans of 37 million
This company owed a lot of money
And youd remember Vijay Mallya
Vijay Mallya was accused
of owing about 100 billion to Indian banks
In 2016 he fled from India
and has been staying in the UK since then
A worldwide freezing order was issued on his assets
he could not sell his assets
And that banks could seize his assets
It meant that if he wanted to sell the shares of this team
he would need the consent of Indian banks
Finally a Canadian businessman Lawrence Stroll
bought the team and its assets
at the cost of 96 billion
Before the restart of the 2018 season
The businessman Lawrence Strolls son
Lance Stroll was a driver of this team in the F1
FiA ordered that this team had to be renamed yet again
since the ownership was changing
This was renamed Racing Point Force India
The next year in 2019 the word India was dropped from the name of the team
And it became Racing Point
In 2021 it was renamed one more time
Aston Martin F1 Team
When Stroll purchased a 17 stake in this car manufacturing company
In India ED claims that
Vijay Mallya used his F1 and IPL teams for money laundering
And Subrata Roy owner of Sahara Pariwar
had built his empire on scams
Today the Formula 1 sport is often criticised
as a useless sport
That no one is benefiting from these car races
And that it merely causes environmental pollution and nothing else
Perhaps Some points of criticism are valid
This is why Formula E has been introduced
Wherein only electric cars would be racing
About 10 years later
a Formula E event was hosted in Hyderabad India some months ago
This event took place on a street circuit
Race tracks werent built for this
The existing roads were closed off
and prepared for this race
Till 2039
Formula E rights have been assigned by the FiA
After which it is expected that
Formula 1 and Formula E would be merged
They will be one sport
And only electric cars would be used for this race
What do you think of this sport?

In the history of Pakistan
none of their Prime Ministers
completed the full 5year term
When Imran Khan became the Prime Minister people believed
that he would be the first Prime Minister to complete his term
But it didnt happen
Imran Khans government has now fallen
Whats the story behind it?
Its quite interesting
Come lets get to know it in todays video
Pakistans Prime Minister the former cricketer Imran Khan
has been ousted from power
after losing the vote of NoConfidence in Parliament
74 members have recorded a vote in favour of the resolution
It has been passed by a majority
of the total membership of the National Assembly
Meanwhile Imran Khan has accused the US
of conspiring to topple him over his ties with Russia and China
Lets start at the beginning
While India had the General Elections in 2019
Pakistan had their General Elections the year before in 2018
Traditionally there have been 2 main parties in India for a long time Congress and BJP
In Pakistans 2018 General Elections
two traditional parties faced off
With Nawaz Sharifs brother Shehbaz Sharif at the helm
And PPP
With Bilawal Bhutto Zardari heading it
Along with them there was a third contesting party
The name means Movement for Justice
And this party was being led by Imran Khan
Imran Khan is a famous Pakistani cricketer
he led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup
The only World Cup won by Pakistan till now
If you look at Pakistans political situation in 2018
Imran Khan was being said to be a new hope
The two traditional parties were accused of nepotism and corruption
PPPs chief Bilawal Bhutto Zardari
is the son of the former PM Benazir Bhutto
and the former President Asif Ali Zardari
And Benazir Bhutto is the daughter of the former PM Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto
On the other hand PMLN Partys image was tainted with accusations of corruption
In 2017 Nawaz Sharif was removed from the post of PM
By the Supreme Court of Pakistan
There were allegations of corruption against him after the Panama Paper leak
And there were several other corruption cases too
In July 2018 he was sentenced to 10years in jail
on the charges of purchase of upscale apartments in London
Six months later he was again sentenced to 7years imprisonment
and a fine of 25 million
because he couldnt prove how he got the ownership of a steel mill in Saudi Arabia
In the midst of such news was Imran Khan
He asked the people to vote for him
and he promised that there would be no corruption and no nepotism
For many people Imran Khan came across as the last hope for Pakistan
At the same time he had some critics too
Imran Khan is an Oxford graduate
he played international cricket
has had 3 love marriages
The first was with a British Jewish billionaires daughter
An interreligious marriage
After hearing this youd assume that hes very openminded
that hed be a secular liberal person
Not quite
Imran Khan was asked if he supports the rights of Ahmadi Muslims
he answered that he doesnt consider the Ahmadis to be Muslims
That he considers them nonMuslims
In case you dont know Ahmadi Muslims
consider Mirza Ghulam Ahmad to be a prophet
A person who doesnt believe our Prophet to be the last Prophet
he isnt a Muslim
Thats why saying that
Im being discriminatory against them
and trying to change the provisions of the Constitution
is a total lie its propaganda
And in his election campaigns he had heavily defended Pakistans blasphemy laws
Pakistans Article 295C
provides for a death penalty for those who
malign Prophet Mohammed
Imran Khan used rightwing jingoistic nationalism too
Nationalism is loving ones country
Jingoistic Nationalism is when
one starts hating other countries
Indian media uses this a lot
And in the 2018 campaigns Imran Khans party used such slogans too
Modi sympathisers are traitors
They even claimed that international establishments and India
were working together to ensure victory for Sharifs party
Its the same as when some political parties in India
accuse other political parties
as being supported by Pakistan
That theyre controlled by Pakistan
Anyway despite all of this
in the 2018 General Elections
Imran Khans party PTI was 1
They won 155 seats
4 times more than they won in the previous elections in 2013
Amazing performance
Because of corruption and nepotism
both traditional parties lost terribly
Shahbaz Sharifs PMLN won 84 seats
and on the 3rd spot was Bilawal Bhutto Zardaris PPP
With 56 seats
These details are important to understanding the current political crisis
So there are 342 seats in Pakistans National Assembly in total
So the majority mark is 172
Despite being the 1 party PTI couldnt cross the 172 mark
They had only 155 seats
Imran Khan formed a collation with some small parties and independent parties
and with their help he could get 178 seats
Doing so helped him form a government
but he was only slightly beyond the majority mark
Only 6 seats more than the majority mark
It wasnt a strong government
And so we come to the present scenario
On 8th March about a month ago
the senior leaders of the opposition parties
presented to the National Assembly
their demand for a NoConfidence vote against Imran Khan
The thing is that over the last few years
almost all opposition parties in Pakistan have joined forces
They created an alliance
called the Pakistan Democratic Movement PDM
This alliance is a catchall collation
There are no set ideologies of this alliance
It has parties of all kinds
From the left wing to the extreme right wing
Secular parties like Balochistan National Party and National Party
And parties like Jamiat UlemaeIslam and Jamiat Ahle Hadith
such religious conservative parties too
Also Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party
a party that talks about Marxism and democratic socialism
And parties like Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz
who talk about freemarket capitalism
Theyre all in it
This alliance began joint opposition rallies about 15 years ago
and raised the issues of the people
They talked about problems that Pakistan faces even today
Nawaz Sharifs daughter Mariyam Nawaz addressed the rallies
saying that Imran Khan has taken away jobs from the people
People dont even have food to last them 2 days
Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that Pakistans farmers are starving
And the youth of the country is furious
There were large crowds at these rallies
Overall inflation unemployment power cuts businesses closing down
were the issues used by the opposition against Imran Khan
And so we get to March 2021
Pakistans Finance Minister Abdul Hafiz Sheikh
contested elections for the Senate
Theres a Senate in Pakistan
it is equivalent to Indias Rajya Sabha
But there are some differences between Indias and Pakistans legislative structures
The National Assembly votes for the elections to the Senate
And Pakistans National Assembly is equivalent to Indias Lok Sabha
Abdul Hafiz Sheikh lost his Senate seat
even though Imran Khan campaigned for him
It was won by the PDM candidate
Yusuf Raza Ghilani
a former Prime Minister of Pakistan
This was a major shock to Imran Khans government
The Finance Minister of the government lost the elections
even though PM Imran Khan was campaigning for him
The opposition used this to ask Imran Khan to resign
Because Imran Khan had lost the confidence of the National Assembly
Seeing this happen Imran Khan called for a Voluntary Vote of Confidence
He asked the Parliament to vote
to see if his government should continue to be in power or not
Whether a majority of the MNAs Members of the National Assembly
support him or not
In India we refer to them as MPs Members of Parliament
While they call them MNAs Members of National Assembly
This was the second time in Pakistans history
when a Prime Minister asked for a vote of confidence in the National Assembly
In this vote Imran Khan proved his majority with 178 votes once again
It was clear that the MNAs with whom Imran Khan had formed the government
all of them still supported his government
But now one year later
The tables have turned
This time instead of Imran Khan the opposition demanded
a vote of confidence
They presented this demand on 8th March
On 10th March Islamabad Police
raided the Parliament lodges
Opposition politicians were dragged away
and arrested by the police
The opposition protested against the government because of this incident
this brutality
The way the opposition politicians were treated
Arrests have begun
The ones present in the Parliament Lodges
are being arrested
They have started arresting the JUIF workers present here
The Interior Minister of Pakistan claimed that
it was important to do so
because the members of the opposition were bringing in crowds to the Parliament
They were calling in mobs
He claimed that JUIF brought in 70 workers
while no one is allowed to have a private militia
In the midst of all this Pakistans Army
which has a large influence on Pakistans politics
I talked about this in an interview
it has been about 34 years
when I interviewed a Pakistani activist
You can watch the video I link to it in the description
Pakistans Army looked at this situation
and decided to be neutral
They didnt choose any side
This angered Imran Khan
In his speech he said
This was a big blow to Imran Khan
because it was believed that
he was in power because of Pakistans Army and ISIs support
And was keeping the opposition in check
Then on 18th March
came another blow to Imran Khan
His party members started revolting against him
PTIs rebel MNA Raja Riaz told news outlets
that about 24 politicians in PTI
were ready to leave their party
How many MNAs are with you?
Were about 2 dozen people
24? Yes sir
And theyre related to PTI? Yes theyre from PTI
Twenty four? Twenty four
It meant that without their support Imran Khans government would fall
He said that most of those politicians
were in the Sindh House in Islamabad
Raja said that he was disappointed with their Prime Minister
There was a gas shortage in his constituency
he talked to the PM about it
but nothing was done to address it
After this interview Imran Khan replied by saying that
the Sindh House where the politicians were staying at
had become a centre for horsetrading
When the news reached more people
Imran Khans supporters the PTI party workers
went to the Sindh House in a group
raised some slogans in favour of Imran Khan
and accused the rebel MNAs to have sold off their conscience
They climbed over the wall and entered the Sindh House
The next day on 19th March
Imran Khan said that the rebel politicians in his party
have agreed to stay with the party
On 20th March Imran Khan gave them an offer
if all of them went back to PTI
they would be forgiven
But on 22nd March
the rebel MNAs rejected the offer of forgiveness
On the contrary an MNA Dr Ramesh Kumar said that
the number of rebel politicians had increased
He said that there were 35 politicians who wanted to leave their party
Ramesh Kumar said that crimes against minorities are on a rise in Pakistan
Earlier on your program we said that there are 33 members today
35 members an increase of 2 members
35 members are showing their grievance with the party right now
that these are our grievances
That these are the things we discussed
but nothing has been done for the minority
Ahmed Hussain said that the Prime Minister had stopped listening to the people
Inflation is on a steep rise in the country
There are more and more difficulties for the masses
Pulses flour butter sugar the prices of all are rising
The rebel MNAs were issued Show Cause Notices by Imran Khans government
According to the Article 63A of Pakistans Constitution
the MNAs of a party arent allowed to easily defect to another party
There are many restrictions on that
But these MNAs replied that
they hadnt left the party
That they havent left PTI
and neither did they join another party
For Imran Khan the problem was that
even if the MNAs didnt defect to another party
even if they were disqualified
Imran Khan would still fall short of the majority mark
More problems ensued on 23rd March
Till then politicians of Imran Khans party were creating problems
but starting then the collation parties started creating problems too
Three collation parties started saying that
They would stop supporting Imran Khans government
The first was the PMLQ
a breakaway faction of the Pakistan Muslim League
The second MQMP
And the third was the BAP
Balochistan Awami Party
They had a total of 17 seats
So what could Imran Khan have done to save his government?
He tried to woo the collation parties
On 28th March the PMLQ leader was offered the post of Punjabs CM
The Punjab in Pakistan
The post of the Chief Minister of that state was offered to the leader of this collation
By doing so he retained PMLQs favour
MQMP was offered the Ministry of Ports and Shipping
But on 30th March this party signed an agreement with the opposition
Imran Khan replied to this by saying that
he plays till the last ball
That he would fight till the last ball to save his government
After this point in time Imran Khan
starting building conspiracy theories about foreign involvement
He said that because he had gone to Russia
America was infuriated over his Russian visit
thats why America is trying to topple his government
In fact he claimed that all the opposition members had teamed up with America
That they have tied up with the USA to overthrow his government
The US State Department and the opposition
refuted this accusation
They claim that Imran Khan is making things up
This is something that the leaders of many countries resort to
Once theyve failed and there are no more excuses
they start blaming foreign countries
After this came 3rd April
The day the Vote of Confidence was supposed to be held in the Assembly
On this day Imran Khan didnt appear before the National Assembly
But his conspiracy theory about foreign involvement
was now taken up by his Law Minister too
The Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly
was from his party
He said that because there is foreign involvement
there cannot be a NoConfidence vote based on that
He invoked Article 5 of Pakistans Constitution
It states that a NoConfidence vote is illegal
if theres an involvement of foreign powers
There was no solid evidence supporting it
2 days later it was reported that
on that day the Speaker of the Assembly wasnt present
And it was said by the Deputy Speaker
And the Speaker wasnt present because he wasnt in favour of the Article 5 ruling
After this ruling Imran Khan advised the President of Pakistan Arif Alvi
to dissolve the entire Assembly
and conduct fresh elections in Pakistan
And their President did so
Because the President is like a rubber stamp
he doesnt have many powers
Till this point in the story you would feel that
it was a happy ending for Imran Khan
That he saved his government by calling for fresh elections
But seeing this happen
the Cheif Justice of Pakistans Supreme Court
took suo moto cognizance of this matter
meaning he brought this matter to the Supreme Court
Supreme Court didnt prolong the proceeding
Neither was the Supreme Court cowed by the government
Rather Pakistans Supreme Court showed brilliant independence of the Judiciary
On 7th April a fivejudge bench of the Supreme Court
passed a unanimous verdict
They said that the actions of Imran Khans government
were unconstitutional
They could not dismiss the NoConfidence Vote with such tactics
The fresh elections being called for
was declared null and void by them
And the demand of the opposition parties for a Vote of Confidence
was held valid and given permission to be held
Then came 9th April
The day of the Vote of Confidence
As expected Imran Khans government lost this vote
The majority mark was 172
and the opposition won 174 votes
An interesting fact here
Imran Khan actually became the first Prime Minister in Pakistan
to be ousted by a NoConfidence Vote
Strictly speaking if a Prime Minister needs to be removed before the end of the term
constitutionally this is the only way to do so
So in a way this political crisis in Pakistan
is good news for Pakistans democracy
Supreme Court acted independently
There was no interference from the army
And the Prime Minister was removed constitutionally
Its said that Shehbaz Sharif can be the next Prime Minister of Pakistan
Overall this situation isnt terribly bad for Imran Khan yet
Its true that he has been removed from the post
but Pakistans General Elections is only a year and a half away
Imran Khan wanted the Assembly to be dissolved now
and fresh elections to be called
Because he believes that the people still support him
And if this is true
there will be elections in 115 years
Imran Khan can wait for 15 years
If Pakistans people really support him
he will win the next elections
By not accepting the NoConfidence Vote Imran Khan
is ruining his image
Here Im reminded of former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
He lost the Vote of Confidence in 1999 by 1 vote
With only 1 vote his government was overthrown
But he didnt use any conspiracy of foreign involvement
he gracefully accepted this decision
and he stepped down from the position of the Prime Minister
Months later when the elections were held again
he was back in power
with a stable majority
Thats why I believe that Imran Khan should accept the result
And respect Pakistans Constitution
Why is it that some countries are successful at protecting democracy?
While others fail

Thank you very much
10 Million subscribers
1 Crore people
Its such an unbelievable number
its more than the population of countries like Switzerland or Norway
First of all a heartfelt thank you to all of you
You made it possible you took us to this milestone
Secondly I decided to do something special for this occasion
In the history videos we discussed several historical events
So I decided to take you into my past
I wanted to show you my childhood videos and tell you stories from my childhood
those that I have never shared before
Come in this video let me take you on a journey
into my life
This story begins in October 1994
I was born in Rohtak Haryana
to a small middleclass family
My parents were quite young about 2425 years old
My mother was a teacher
and my father was an engineer
Together they earned about 4000 per month
There werent many videos back then
because video cameras were rare then
There are some photos like these
but I hid my parents faces for privacy
Friends in my childhood I got to travel a lot
Though I dont remember any of it
because I was a weaning infant
But there are several photos
from the snow in Srinagar  to Jaisalmers desert
This is because my maternal grandfather worked in BSF
Youd know that if a family member works in the army
they are frequently posted in numerous places
All across India
This is why when my parents would go to meet my maternal grandparents
they got to visit all these places
Of course I do not remember the first few years
My earliest memories are from Rohtak
Playing in Rohtaks lake
and playing at my paternal grandparents home
Some years later my parents moved to Delhi
for better job opportunities
My father was offered a better job at a better salary
They told me that around 20022003
their salary was around 17000 per month
There was a big turning point in life in 2003
when my father was offered an even better job in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia
And so he moved to Malaysia
But my mother my brother and I didnt go there
because though the salary offered was a lot
but it wasnt enough for the entire family
with the increased living expenses
it wouldve cancelled out the salary boost
So we lived in Delhi but once a year we went to Malaysia
So during the summer vacation
I got the opportunity to visit abroad for the first time
That was my first foreign trip
We lived there for 1 month during the summer of 2003
There were new experiences in the new country
I remember eating a waffle with maple syrup for the first time
I loved it
And this was the first time I got to play with Lego
Lego had a large impact on my life
as youd see later in this story
But it was in Malaysia that our family bought our first digital camera
So there are some videos from then
Like any other 89 year old child
I had a lot of free time
And friends this was when I made my first video
The first video was in 2003
The thing is that we had a computer
and we recently bought a new webcam for the computer
Youd recall that the internet was very slow back then
When my parents wanted to talk to each other from Malaysia to India
they used Yahoo! Messenger
The dialup internet
Video calling was a recent addition to it
you could see the person you were talking to
Though the internet was so slow
that the video was heavily pixelated
I dont know what was the resolution of the webcams back then
perhaps it was around 240p
But I learned one thing from this webcam
perhaps my father taught me
you could click on it and capture photos
There was a button
I learned that if 24 photos were placed one after another
and played them successively
it could create a video of 1 second
I learned about the concept of frame rates
What is 24fps?
Basically in a 1second long video there are 24 photos
This was a mindblowing fact for my young mind
Because I realised that I could create animated films
You remember playing with clay right?
I created characters with that clay
and kept a white sheet as a background
and used the webcam to take a photo
I moved the clay character a bit and took another photo
Move a bit more and took another photo
And eventually I took about 5060 photos
And created a 12 second long video
In which these clay characters were seemingly moving on their own
This is known as Claymation
The video was like this
You werent expecting much were you?
I was a child of 89 years
What more could you expect?
Like other kids of that time I enjoyed reading comics
Specially Tinkle comics
That was my favourite
Of course I enjoyed watching cartoons on TV back then
Mowgli is eating a banana here
Oh no! Someone is setting the tail on fire
Oh! It is Mowgli
Who else could it be?
Popeye was my favourite cartoon back then
Id say that my obsession with eating healthy stems from here
One should always have spinach and other vegetables
Its unfortunate that the cartoons presented to children nowadays
often unhealthy food is promoted in them
A cartoon promoting laddoo
Fortunately vegetables and spinach were promoted when I was young
You wont believe this but since I was 12 years old I havent had any soft drinks
I stopped drinking soft drinks like Pepsi and CocaCola at 12 years old
because I was obsessed with eating healthy
2008 when I was around 1415 years old
reading became a passion
I loved reading books
The credit lies solely with Satyajit Rays books
At this point in time had you asked me
what I wanted to be once I grew up
I would have answered A criminal investigator or a detective
This is because I loved the Feluda series
I read these detective stories every single day
And it kept playing in my head
Of course soon I realised that
today detectives werent the same as depicted in novels
After a little research on the internet I found that
most private detectives hired nowadays
were hired to catch cheating spouses
And the serious investigators working with the police
didnt work the same way as written in the books
Overall a terrible career option
Around this time I developed an interest in Mechanical Robots
You need to turn this to make it move
Light sensor
And the touch sensor is on the bumper
Press this here
My parents had bought me this set that I absolutely loved
These Lego blocks could be used to create robots
with touch sensors and light sensors
They could be programmed
I was so obsessed with it for hours that
I made my own robot programmed it
to carry a digital camera
so that whenever it hit something
it would activate its touch sensor
and it would change direction and continue going forwards
I wasnt born a genius
neither was I a talented child
If you see the marks I got at school
I was an aboveaverage student
I got about 7080 at school
I believe that if any child is given such toys
and if the child spends enough time with these
anyone could build these things
And thankfully there werent any social media to distract me
Or to waste my time
Which allowed me to spend time on these
Fast forwarding 2 years in 2010
In 2010 had you asked me what I wanted to be once I grew up
I would have answered a host on National Geographic or Discovery Channel
At this time the programs on these channels were my favourites
Like Bear Grills Man vs Wild
Or the shows on Travel and Living Channel
where new countries and hotels were explored
Luckily Im doing something similar on my vlog channel now
I believe myself to be very fortunate to get this opportunity
But back then I had no idea about how to choose this career option
How did one get to interview with the TV channels?
If one wanted to choose this career path what was to be done?
What should one study?
I had no idea
In December 2011 Anna Hazare Arvind Kejriwal and other social activists
began protesting against rampant corruption all over the country
Media gave a lot of positive coverage to these protests
Something that is impossible to imagine nowadays
Any protest getting such positive coverage
But friends this began my interest in politics
The sole reason
Because friends in my family relatives
even among the farflung relatives
theres not a single person
that has any connection to politics
Zero political connection
This is important for the people spreading misinformation about me
that I have a connection with such and such political party
or that so and so family member is in a political party
theyre lying
Before 2011 I had zero interest in politics
Traditionally in most Haryanvi families
2 professions have been the most common
Begin in agricultural or armed forces
Youd see this in my family too
Three of my close relatives are in the Army
My maternal grandfather and 2 uncles
Several people are involved in agriculture
In fact it was rare for my father to be an engineer
Anyway getting back to my story
After 201213 my interest in politics deepened
When the AAP government was formed in Delhi for the first time
Arvind Kejriwals famous 49day government was formed
And when Narendra Modi became the new Prime Minister in 2014
my interest in politics deepened further
Like many people I was delighted to see the Congress government lose power
A person who promised to bring back the black money within 100 days
to end corruption
back then my political ideology
was 100 anticongress
I hated the Congress party
because that was the narrative set by the media and TV channels
It was only later that I found out
the level to which the media could fall
But even before that it took me only a few months
to realise the misdirections
Black money wasnt going to come back
In fact RTI was going to be diluted
Foreign funding for political parties was going to be legalised
Corruption began at a larger scale
but it would be hidden
Media would be bought
Seeing it happen in a bought of frustration
I published the initial videos on YouTube
But enough about the politics
But the very first video published on the channel
was a travel vlog in 2014
To understand how that came to be
lets rewind to 2012
That was the year I completed my 12th board
I got 85 on it
My philosophy was always the 8020 rule
Though I didnt know about the 8020 rule then
but I always used this subconsciously
I believed one should study only to get a good enough score
That would be sufficient to show people that
youre a good enough student
But not to expect a topper
I realised that if you had to study for 2 days to get 80 marks
you had to study for 8 more days for the remaining 20
It means that its quite easy to get 80
But it is increasingly difficult to take it to 100
It takes a lot more effort
Why should I put in the extra effort?
I wasnt interested in being a topper
Youd say that its important to get into good colleges
or else you wont get admission
Youre right but
I wasnt very interested in going to topnotch colleges
And thankfully there wasnt any pressure from my parents for this
My parents were content with me not being a topper
because I was good enough at studies
they believed Id manage well
Friends I learned about the 8020 Rule later
and started applying it in my life
This rule basically says that
you do not need to be 100 perfect in everything
Instead put in the bare minimum efforts to be 80 perfect
and for many things in life that will be enough
Obviously if you aim at being a topper
you need to be 100 perfect at your studies
But this strategy can be used in all aspects of life
I talked about this in detail in my course on Time Management
If you havent enrolled for the course
I recommend that you try it out
if you are a student or work at a 95 job
you can learn how you can maximise your time
I learned this from my experience
How am I able to manage the channels and travel all at once?
I talk about all of it in this course
I tell you practically
how you can use these techniques in your life
and improve yourself
The link to this course is in the description below
Honestly those who have taken this course
say that it has been lifechanging for them

Go join it ASAP
Getting back to my story
youd be wondering what I chose after the 12th
I wanted to have all my options open
I took the admission tests for various colleges
Such as Manipal University IIT JEE
Back then the two IIT and JEE were separate exams
But unfortunately none of the ranks was so good
that I could secure admission
So yeah the 8020 philosophy isnt a good idea
if you want to be a topper and secure admission to IIT
Apart from these engineering exams
I sat for the NDA exam too
Actually to be honest joining Indian Air Force or the Indian Army
was my first choice  instead of these engineering colleges
There were 2 main reasons for this
First when I think about office jobs
it seems astoundingly boring to me
A job with the Army is more physically challenging and adventurous
Second as I told you before
several relatives were in the Army
So I made sure to study really well for this exam
because it was important to pass that
Friends there are 2 stages in the selection process of NDA
First is the written test
And the second is the SSB interview
After passing the written test I was called to Varanasi for the interview
I was very confident when I went to Varanasi
because there are 2 stages in the interview stage
One of which was the physical test
I was confident that I would easily pass the physical test
because I considered myself to be very fit
And then was the actual interview
Friends this was perhaps the most ironic event in my life
In the interview process candidates are given a topic
and they are asked to discuss and debate it
A group of 1012 students are formed
And the group is given a topic to debate on
I was a part of such a group
And when it was our turn they gave us a topic
And we were asked to start our debate
Before I could even think about it
some people started to debate it passionately
I looked to one and the others
and could get in only a few sentences
about what I agreed with and what I disagreed with
And within moments the debate ended
Back then I wasnt good at putting my point across
I talked slowly
And in this interview they were looking for people
who could talk straightforwardly loudly and clearly
With a powerful voice
And do you know how my speaking style was?
Like this
Integrated within the gearbox
And now as a beltdriven system
for more flexibility
and shockhandling capability
Obviously I failed this interview
and then we began planning for what we could do next
Which college we could choose
Then my parents began looking at colleges outside of India
because they believed that better than
getting admission to any Cgrade engineering college in India
was studying abroad
And then we chose Germany
Youd ask why Germany
It was simple
The other Englishspeaking developed countries
such as the USA the UK Australia Canada
have high tuition fees
Studying there wouldve been very expensive
On the other hand in Germany and other European countries
studying is almost free
because therere no tuition fees
Especially if you study in their local languages
Obviously there would still be living expenses
The living costs are quite expensive
For that my parents took out an education loan
The applications were sent to several colleges and universities
And the acceptance came from 2 places
First was the Eindhoven University in the Netherlands
And the second was Germanys Karlsruhe Institute of Technology
We saw that they were among the well respected and highranking universities in the world
How did I secure admission without being a topper?
All I can say about this is that
perhaps it was luck to a large extent
because back then in 2012 not many people went abroad to study
and the number of foreigners applying to these universities wasnt large
So there wasnt a lot of competition
The other reason that might have played a role in it was perhaps
that the foreign universities dont focus much on marks
They focus on other skills hobbies and experiences
Perhaps when I showed my interest in Lego robots
and mentioned it on the application
that might have played a role
Because the course I applied for was
In August 2012 at 17 years old
I moved from India to Germany
Here if you ask me why I chose Mechanical Engineering
one of the reasons was that
the interest in robotics and technology that I had since early childhood
but the second but bigger reason was that
at 17 years which child knows what they should do?
Most of my friends and classmates were choosing engineering
and back then it was often said that
if you dont know what you should do
you should do engineering and then decide what you really want to do
So even though I wasnt 100 sure
about what I wanted to do
engineering seemed like a good option
so I chose to do that
Later I found it quite interesting
And I completed the Bachelors course in 2015
after which I did my Masters in Renewable Engineering
from the same university at Karlsruhe
This university Karlsruhe Institute of Technology
I made a vlog on the university tour
In case you havent watched it the link to it is in the description below
Interestingly in 2014
during an internship
I move out of the University
for an internship at the office of a company
It was a bit away from the main city
About a 1hour trip daily by tram
On this tram I met a girl Juli
We took the same tram every day
Juli would be on her to her school and Id be going for the internship
Exactly 75 years after this
we got married
2014 was the year when I uploaded my first video on YouTube
This happened a few months after meeting Juli
This was the time when my fascination with YouTube began
I discovered the existence of such a platform
I was interested in making videos since my childhood
so I started using this platform
And eventually began uploading videos regularly
We crossed the 50000 subscriber mark in 2017
but my parents didnt think that it could be a career option
On top of it I believed that even if it did become a career option
perhaps this wouldnt generate a respectable amount of income
So I decided to continue with my studies
And then in 2018
I got my Masters degree
And another Bachelors
on Economics and Business Management
But this was purely out of interest
So that I could make better videos
So that I could do this better
After 201718 I put YouTube as the 1 priority
and kept education on 2
Because this was my passion
I started believing that this was possible
That I could definitely do something that was never done before
And that was it friends
When one is passionate about something
when you truly enjoy doing something
It is easy to bring consistency and discipline into it
I wont say that its entirely easy
you still need to put in your efforts and hard work
But to a large extent it is comparatively easier
Remember that dialogue in 3 Idiots?
You should study to be capable not successful
A great man once said
Study not to be successful but to be capable
Excellence chase excellence
And success will follow you
I never focused on reaching a certain number of subscribers
Throughout my YouTube career I focused on
how I could keep improving myself
On how I could improve the quality of the videos I produce
And how I could better deliver my message to you
I simply hope that you keep enjoying future videos
If you want to ask me anything
you can ask your questions in the comment section
Since this is a special video I will try to answer as many questions as I can

Sun is shining brightly
But not very brightly

Todays sports news
a new game has been invented
In this video you can see him play it
How is it played?
This is a hockey stick
A hockey stick
Can you see it? Yes I can
We can see it!
And what inspired you to invent this game?
I joined 2 games and got this idea
But where did you get this idea?
Thats a football and this is a hockey stick
and when these come together  you get HockeyFootball
I invented this new game
This is an imaginary ball
Where did this ball come from?
Today we have a man with us who
has started playing a weird sport
Byebye This is was for todays sports news
About 100 million years ago
Earth looked completely different
With no humans some scary animals were ruling over this planet
Dinosaurs so big that they were taller than buildings
With jaws so strong that they could have crushed your bones within a second
They were so fast that they ran at around the speed of 90kmhr
They were truly feararousing creatures
They ruled over Earth for more than 170 million years
But then one day something happened
That completely wiped them off the planet
And how?
Come lets understand this in todays video
As it gets closer to the planet Earths gravitational pull gets stronger
They now cant see whats headed their way
Friends the word Dinosaur originated from Greek
From the words Denios and Sauros
Denios means Terrible And Sauros means Lizard
A terrible lizard
This is the literal meaning of the word Dinosaur
The word was used for the first time in 1841
When dinosaur fossil was discovered for the first time
Richard Owen a British scientist used the word dinosaur
Back then people did not know much about dinosaurs or their appearance
So the initial drawings of how dinosaurs might have looked
Are vastly different from what we know now
Megalosaurus was one of the first fossils to be discovered
Look at the initial drawings of it
Decades later as the researchers discovered more information about them
The drawings were modified
Trying to make them more realistic
So the depictions look like this now
Today more than 10000 dinosaur fossils
have been unearthed by palaeontologists worldwide
And more than 900 distinct have been identified
You might be excited by the prospect of discovering more fossils
But interestingly from 2003 to 2022
On average each year about 45 new species of dinosaurs have been identified
The work of palaeontologists is far from over
Look at the photos of the new species of dinosaurs discovered last year
Of them this is a bizarre dinosaur discovered in Chile
with a weapon that looks like a blade on its tail
And a beak for a mouth
It was named Stegouros Elengassen
Overall we know a lot about dinosaurs today
But come lets start this story at the beginning
Lets dive into the past
Millions of years ago
Scientists estimate that the first dinosaur
emerged about 230240 million years
Because the oldest dinosaur fossils that we have found till now
Is from 2314 million years ago in Africa
Back then Earth was much different than it is today
The continents that you see now
Asia Africa Australia Europe
All continents were joined together
There was only one supercontinent
That we call Pangaea
Scientists believe that Pangaea looked somewhat like this
You can even see the placement of the continents that we know
Then the climate of Earth was dry and arid with only a little rain
This time period has been named the Triassic Period
The era when the dinosaurs had started emerging
Dinosaurs were slowly populating the Earth due to evolution
The dinosaurs of this era arent anything like the ones you imagine
They were quite small in size
The common dinosaurs of the time
Were generally around 2 meters long only
For example Eoraptor was a dinosaur that existed in that period
In fact this dinosaur is known as the ancestor of other dinosaurs
The dominant animals of the era
Were giant reptiles
Some of these reptiles looked cute
Like this one thats believed to be the ancestor of all turtles
With time Earth started changing
201 million years ago the Triassic period ended
When Earths climate changed suddenly
The Pangaea started breaking apart
Although I am using the word suddenly
It didnt happen in a day or two
It was relatively sudden
In the time scale of millions of years
It happened gradually over thousands of years
Cracks appeared in the supercontinent
Largescale volcanic explosions took place on and around the cracks
Due to the numerous volcanic eruptions
a large amount of carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide was released into the atmosphere
This caused intense global warming
When the sulphur dioxides and aerosols entered the atmosphere
It blocked the sunlight and caused some cooling
Acidification of the oceans started
When the carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide mixed with the water
The acidity of the ocean water increased
The climate was changing rapidly
And survival became difficult for the animals that existed
Most reptiles and other species back then were coldblooded animals
They couldnt withstand the temperature changes
But the dinosaurs were warmblooded like humans
It was easier for the dinosaurs to tolerate the temperature changes
The volcanic eruptions and climate change continued for about 600000 years
Due to this almost all the other species became extinct
The only animals remaining on Earth were the dinosaurs crocodiles turtles and early mammals
This event is known as the TriassicJurassic Extinction Event
As I said after this the Triassic period ended
And the Jurassic period began
If this sounds like a familiar name
This is the inspiration for the name of the Jurassic Park films
The word Jurassic refers to this Jurassic Period
The Jurassic period lasted from 201 million ago to 145 million years ago
During this time dinosaurs emerged as the most dominant species on the planet
Due to evolution some of them became quite large in size
Like some of the earliest Titanosaurus
They lived around 160 million years ago
Each of them weighed up to 15000 kg
And could be up to 15 metres long
Some other iconic dinosaurs of the time were
During the Jurassic period some dinosaurs evolved to fly
One of the first feathered dinosaurs was Archaeopteryx
It looked somewhat like this
At this time the Pangaea supercontinent
Was divided into two
Two smaller supercontinents
We named them Laurasia and Gondwanaland
Friends due to the Jurassic Park films
The Jurassic period is the most widely known
But it was the next period when dinosaurs truly flourished
The Cretaceous period
Because at this time we saw an explosion in the diversity of dinosaurs
Several new species of dinosaurs evolved
TRex perhaps the most famous dinosaur to be shown in films
Existed in the Cretaceous period
It reached peak dominance only at the end of the Cretaceous period
Around 6568 million years ago
Though this is debated among researchers
Most scientists believe that TRex didnt exist in the Jurassic period
Its quite ironic that in the film Jurassic Park
TRex is used for their logo
The Cretaceous period was the longest time in the era of dinosaurs
Starting around 145 million years ago
It lasted til 65 million years ago
The 2 supercontinents Laurasia and Gondwanaland
Started breaking up
And the structure of the continents
Looked similar to what we see today Several flowering plants evolved at this time
Several flowering plants evolved around this time
And the average temperature of the Earth was warmer than it was in the past
Sea levels were quite high
And almost all kinds of dinosaurs that you can imagine
Existed during this period
Raptors Armored Dinosaurs
Giant herbivorous dinosaurs
Dangerous carnivorous dinosaurs
Titanosaurus one of the largest land animals
Argentinosaurus which could weigh up to 77 tonnes
And TRex that could be up to 40 feet long
Believed to be the apex predator of its time
It had the strongest and most powerful jaws compared to any other animal
A fun fact the evolution of grass
began only 70 million years ago
In the story that I have been telling you
Dont imagine a grassfilled Earth
There were other kinds of plants
TRex and Triceratops evolved 68 million years ago
Do you know what this means?
We are closer to the dinosaur TRex
Than it was to the Jurassic Period
Since theres 80 million years between the Jurassic period and the TRex evolution
But only 68 million years between us and TRex
Another interesting dinosaur that existed then
Were the Ornithomimids
They looked like ostriches
They were among the fastest dinosaurs
They could run at the speed of 80 kmhr
And in terms of flying instead of running
The largest flying dinosaur was Quetzalcoatlus
Had a wingspan of 1011 meters
As you can see this was the most prosperous period for dinosaurs
The climate was favouring them new species were evolving
And there were no other animal species to compete with them
They were simply ruling over Earth
Everything was going well
Until one day something happened that completely wiped off dinosaurs from Earth forever
A large asteroid with a diameter of roughly 1015 km
Came hurling towards Earth and crashed into it
This happened 66 million years ago
And this asteroid strike ended the Cretaceous period
The speed of the asteroid was 30 km per second
150 times faster than a jet airliner
Specifically speaking it hit the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico
The same place where millions of years later the Mayan tribe emerged
And built historical wonders like Chichen Itza
I explored the Yucatan Peninsula in my vlogs as well
You can watch the vlogs of this place if you want to
The link will be in the description
When the asteroid hit Earth
It created a large crater
With a diameter of 180 km
Due to its impact energy was released at such a speed
That could be released with 100 teratonnes of TNT 100 trillion tonne or 100000 trillion kg
If you compare this with the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
The asteroid produced 1 billion times their energy
This was such a big impact
That everything around it disintegrated in the blink of an eye
The impact threw a lot of soil into the air
The land heated up
And the hot dust rained over the other areas
The global temperatures rose by several degrees for hours
All animals within thousands of kilometres of range from here
Were cooked alive by the sheer heat
Its believed that only small animals could survive the impact of this initial blast
Because they found underground shelter
Or they hid underwater in caves or in large tree trunks
But this was only the initial impact
This was followed by shock waves heat pulses
Wildfires in the forests for thousands of kilometres
And big tsunamis
Its speculated that there would have been an immediate tsunami with a 2 km tall wave
Can you even imagine a 2 km tall tsunami wave?
Volcanic eruptions started once again
Acid rain fell and earthquakes occurred
The shortterm effects were quite deadly
But you would think that
on the other side of the Earth that wasnt hit
Animals could have perhaps survived there
But the longterm consequences were even deadlier
The dust particles in the air
Blocked sunlight for the next year all around the planet
The planet went into a nuclear winter
The temperature dropped drastically
Its estimated that for the next 3 years
The earth was at freezing temperatures
It killed many plants and animals
Since the sunlight was blocked for 1 year
It was impossible for plants to use photosynthesis
The plants died
With dying plants the herbivorous animals had nothing to eat and they died out
Even the carnivorous animals were left with nothing to eat and they too died out
A chain reaction was caused
The only animals safe of these consequences
Were small omnivorous animals
Such as mammals lizards turtles and some birds
These animals could survive because
They could survive as scavengers as well
The dead dinosaurs fungus decaying plant matter
These were the food that kept them alive
These small creatures could survive for a significant amount of time
The impact of the asteroid had destroyed carbonate rocks too
This caused carbon and sulphur to be released into the atmosphere once again
And for the next several thousand years
The sunlight was significantly reduced
That was not at the normal levels
Apart from this acid rain continued for thousands of years
When the nuclear winter ended
The dust in the atmosphere settled down
Sunlight reached the planet once again
But the problem was that a large quantity of carbon dioxide was already released into the atmosphere
Think about this friends
One asteroid changed earths history for the next thousands of years
If we ignore a few exceptions
No 4legged creature weighing more than 25 kg
Could survive this event
All terrestrial dinosaurs went extinct
And with them the plant and animal species once thriving on Earth
More than 75 of it went extinct
Friends at this point the Cretaceous period ended
And the next era began
The Paleogene period
Friends it wasnt as if everything had ended
This event was like an opportunity for the rest of the animal species
The rulers of the planet Dinosaurs were no more
So it was an opportunity for the other animals to come up and rule
Humans should be thankful for this asteroid
Because this awarded a good opportunity for the evolution of mammals
After the extinction of dinosaurs
The gap in the food chain left by the dinosaurs
Was filled in by several mammals
It was in this period that we saw the evolution of horses whales bats and primates
Several snakes and smaller lizards started emerging in this period
The only group of dinosaurs that could survive
were the flying dinosaurs
Gradually they evolved and became the birds that we now know
Yup you read that right
The birds that you see flying around today
The flying dinosaurs are their ancestors
Most studies have confirmed that
Birds belong to the same family as dinosaurs
Specifically speaking ancestry is shared most closely by
Chickens and ostriches
This is why people might say that
The closest living relative of TRex a dangerous dinosaur
Is a chicken
You might have a question about the asteroid
How did we find out
The spot where the asteroid crashed?
And that it crashed 66 million years ago?
How did we figure out the date?
This is evidenced by a rare mineral
Scientists found that at a few places on Earth
We have a high concentration of iridium on the ground
But when the geologists analysed Earth
they found that it is a very rare mineral on Earth
Despite that it is so abundant on our ground
This could happen because comets and asteroids
Have a high concentration of iridium
And when scientists put the iridium into carbon dating
They found that the iridium layer that we find
Is 66 million years old
This could happen only when the asteroid hit the planet
And in the pursuing blast this mineral spread all around
You might also wonder that since the asteroid had an impact this big
We should be able to see the crater it left on Earth
Well you are not wrong
But an event that occurred so long ago 66 million years ago
Might not look like youd imagine it to be
Because since then the continents have been relentlessly shifting
The crater of this asteroid is hidden in the Yucatan Peninsula
But several digging expeditions were conducted
That proved that it had actually happened
And the exact location it happened
If you look at the map this is the exact location
Half of it is submerged under the sea
And the other half is on land
A realworld impact that we can still see
Are the cenotes in this Mexican area
These beautiful sinkholes show a pattern
The crater formed by the asteroid
The cenotes can be found in a ring formation around the crater
Nowadays they are famous tourist attractions
You can go swimming in these cenotes
And overall these cenotes form the worlds largest underground cave system
After hearing this astounding story of this asteroid strike
You might be thinking about what would happen
If such an asteroid comes and hits the planet now?
Will humans go extinct?
This is definitely a threat
The asteroids that might hit Earth in the foreseeable future
Are known as Near Earth Asteroids
NASA and other space agencies are
continuously tracking all nearearth asteroids
To compute their path and if and when they will collide with Earth
As of April 2022 more than 28000 near earth asteroids have been identified
Of which more than 800 have a diameter of 1 km or more
This is a scary number
So many asteroids that may potentially collide with Earth
But today you dont need to be scared about this
Because scientific calculations are so advanced that
We can clearly predict their path
And can calculate the exact location of the impact
We can even estimate the chances of it actually colliding with Earth
And if they are indeed on a path of collision
What can we do to stop it?
This was the idea behind NASAs DART space mission launched in 2021
Double Asteroid Redirection Test
They planned to have a spacecraft collide with an asteroid
So that the path of the asteroid can be altered
And if in future theres an asteroid about to collide with Earth
We can alter its path
This might sound like science fiction
But this idea was already successful
In September 2022 a test was launched
On an asteroid that was not on the path towards Earth
NASA sent a spacecraft to it
The spacecraft collided with the asteroid and its path was altered
If they could successfully do it to that asteroid
It can be done to any asteroid on the way to Earth in future
But that doesnt mean that theres no danger at all
Humans are the danger here
The asteroid strike that killed the dinosaurs Is known as the 5th extinction event in Earths history
After this scientists believe that the 6th extinction event
Has already begun
This isnt due to any volcano or asteroid
It is caused by humans
This is named the Holocene Extinction Event
Over the last 100200 years
We have seen the loss of biodiversity at an unprecedented scale
Animals and plant species are rapidly going extinct due to humans
Biologists agree that it is a mass extinction
Deforestation by humans
Pollution in oceans and atmosphere
Due to this the normal rate is more than 1001000 times more than the current rate of extinction
Habitats of the animals that exist now
Are being destroyed
Thousands of mammals birds reptiles and amphibians
Are now in the endangered category
Or have already gone extinct due to humans
To stop this destruction
a United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity Meeting was held in Japan in 2010
20 biodiversity targets were set
To be achieved by 2020
Unfortunately only 6 of those have been partially achieved
In January 2020 a new Parisstyle plan was  set
to prevent biodiversity and ecosystem collapse
The deadline was set as 2030
Its purpose is to ensure that 30
of the land and oceans are given the status of being protected
To reduce pollution by at least 50
Scientists have proposed that the extinctions taking place
Need to be limited to 20 per year or fewer
Well have to see how many targets can be met
But one thing is certain that
it is important to do these
Because if plants and animals species go extinct now
In the same way it happened in the previous extinction events
Perhaps it wouldnt be possible for humans to survive
Its interesting to note that
As per calculations humans originated
merely 300000 years ago in Africa
As per the data
Compared to the dinosaurs
Who were the dominant species on Earth for 174 million years
Weve been here for only 300000 years
While they lived for 174 million years
600 times longer than humans
Can humans beat the record set by dinosaurs?
Or will humans go extinct before theyre 1 million years old?
Obviously the right answer will depend on
Our collective efforts to save this planet
