We just got dropped off in the middle of an abandoned city
And were going to spend the next seven days here
And there goes our only way out
Were now stranded for the next seven days
Why are we doing this?
For content
This once beautiful city was bombed an abandoned
because of war
which means the only people here are us and our cameraman
At least that we know of
So I guess we start off by getting off the roof
We knew that our first objective was to explore this city
and find a safe place to call home for the next seven days
which starts with exploring this building
All right lets see whats down the bottom of this building
I assume under this wood is a floor
Only one way to find out
All right this is crazy
I feel like Im in a zombie apocalypse
This is wild
Oh look at this
After a little more exploring
we stumbled upon an area that might work for our shelter
Oh my Gosh
I think this is where we should set up camp
You can see the entire city over here
Plus we have a roof to protect us from rain
And now that we had our home base decided
the next step was to open up
the supplies crate left by the helicopter on the roof
Lets pop open this crate so we can build camp
We need some gear
This crate contains all of the survival gear
well need for the next seven days
And so we dont have to carry stuff all the way down the stairs
Were just going to drop it
We have a perfect assembly line
Kris its raining sleeping bags
Chandler theres our dinner plates
Wait Chandler dont let it fall
That was the coolest thing weve ever done
But jokes aside it was time to actually start surviving now
Who wants fire duty?
Well get it  Were on bed duty
Kris got started on making a fire with Mark
Im personally a fan of the log cabin when it comes to fires
Eagle Scout Did I mention that yet?
While Chandler and I look for something for us to sleep on
This is what mattresses were like a hundred years ago?
Wait you found a mattress?
Yeah  Where?
On the second floor in a corner
Thats all you  Thanks
You should wrap that thing in a tarp
so you dont get destroyed by bugs
Im going to wrap that mattress like a burrito
And while Chandler took us chances with a sketchy mattress
The rest of us decided to sleep on wooden doors
Theres no shot that youre more comfortable than me right now
My back already hurts
There are so many buildings we have yet to explore in the city
Tomorrows going to be insane
Well see you in the morning
Even though our first day in the city went pretty smooth
Something eerie did happen to occur later that night
While we were sleeping
Mark and some of the camera guys
woke up to the sound of breaking glass
not far from the camp
Which made us start to wonder
if we were really alone inside the city
What was it?
We just heard glass shattering there
I thought I saw something
But on top of the freaky noises
this first shelter was way too windy to sleep
Howd you guys sleep?
So in pursuit of better sleep we got up got breakfast
and prepare to find our new shelter
This is the first time Ive had chili for breakfast
But Im so hungry I kind of dont care
Well since the raft
When have I ever been this excited over canned chili?
I think my brain tried to forget about that Thanks
So after a nutritious breakfast we took off our drone
to seek out a new shelter in the unexplored buildings
We havent explored that building
We havent explored those hotels
It is an actual city here
However upon scanning the buildings
we did stumble upon an unexpected guest
Theres a cat  Theres a cat down there
Im going to land the drone right beside the cat
Look at that shot
Kris Kris look its sniffing the camera
This cat has no survival instinct
I promise we are not paying this cat to be an actor
As fun as playing with these cats is we need to focus on shelter
because its going to be freezing tonight
And so we started our journey
to find a sufficient shelter for the challenge
Wait what is this?
This is pretty
It just has this type of like aesthetic to it
that is like beautiful even though its ugly
Zombie apocalypse aesthetic
Yeah There you go
Wait is that a pool?
What the heck?
This is so eerie
Back in the day this used to look something like this
And after decades
of rotting from being abandoned this is what were left with
Wait theres a soccer field?
The sports court
Is that a soccer ball?
I almost died
I bet this soccer ball is older than me
Older than all of us for sure
Well besides Mark hes old
We have two options now
We can keep exploring down this cool looking tunnel
and go check out the neighborhood
Or with the hour of light we have left
we can prep for nighttime and not freeze all night
Not freeze  That sounds like a good idea
I agree
And after spending the entire day looking for a new shelter
I just cant get over how massive the city is
We finally found a place fortified enough to call home
So we dont freeze tonight
Were thinking of setting up camp in this room right here
Well have a fire pit right here
We can tarp the wall right there Its going to be comfy
Yeah Marks going to do all that
I said we
The only hard part is come over here
Our current camp and all our gear is all the way over there
I hope this place really works out
because its going to be a lot of effort to set up
With the sun getting low and the temperature rapidly dropping
We made our way back to the old camping spot
and packed up to settle into the new base
Were headed into the new campsite
The new camp the new camp
The new camp
Okay weve got a lot of cleanup to do to prep this for tonight
This looks like a terrible place but whatever
After finding a more weatherproof base
we spent the next few hours dragging in as many of our belongings
as we could before sundown
Now because it got dark so fast
we couldnt bring all of our resources to the new base
So aside from one water bag
cans of chili and a couple of old mattresses this is all we had
What does everyone think of our new place?
I like that theres no wind
And its much warmer
It was now the third day of seven doing this challenge
And once we got up we continued exploring
Be careful
These stairs actually steep
On this whole staircase
three of the stairs are normal
This beach is nice
It actually smells like a beach
Its because it is a beach
But not too far in something strange happened
I think I see someone
Dont you see that reflecting thing over there under the stairs?
Oh I do
Jimmy remember how we almost died
the first night from glass bottle attack?
I wonder if thats where the glass bottles came from
It was at this moment when we realized
we actually werent alone in this abandoned city after all
And once our cameraman spotted this mysterious person on our drone
we did what anyone would do
Lets go check it out
That building is sick
Why is this mansion beside this giant motel?
Decades ago this hotel stood as a first class vacation resort
But years of war turn this once picturesque property
into a city of ruins
Lets head on in
What did we just get ourselves into?
We totally dont wait for the cameraman
to walk in the room before we go in
Its getting dark
Everyone stop
We should go in there
Ill go first
Go ahead Thank you
You think its a Feastables bar?
This is starting to get very eerie and I think Mark should go first
Look at how deep this hallway is
Also if you fall over here you might die
Theres a very nonzero chance somebody could be in here
and like attack us
If someone attacked us What are we doing?
Every man for himself
Yeah whoevers the slowest just dies
Whats that light?
Im creeped out now guys
We spent the rest of the day searching for the lurk
but once it started getting dark
we can only hope that later he wouldnt be looking for us
And now that its dark out
heres what weve actually been waiting for
Give me Big Bertha
Thank you
Big Bertha
Notice how you cant see that building over there
This is the worlds most powerful flashlight
Now you can
Bro I bet the fish in the ocean are tripping
It stopped working
How the mighty have fallen
The pluses of our actions is we got to play with the worlds
strongest flashlight at night
The negatives of our actions is that we got to walk back in the dark
That was bad timing
Its way scarier going through this place at night
Yeah a thousand percent
It really feels like the world is ending
and were just like surviving
So to avoid being murdered in cold blood
we return back the camp
Were back at camp
Yeah Ill get a fire going
Im hungry
Theres literally only chili left
And so with the last of our supply here were feasting
Tomorrow if we got some tables and seven chairs
And more food  Thatd be awesome
But when we woke up on the morning of day four out of seven
we realized that we were already running low on supplies
Our bag of water is out of water
Do we have more?
Point the camera at that roof all the way over there
I wish I had more than a hundred calories in my body to go get it
Nose goes
What does nose goes mean?
It sounds like youre going
Hes going to need help He cant carry it on his own
So Mark and Chandler set out to go all the way back
to ground Zero to get more supplies from the crate
Chandler and I were on a side quest for water
This is a main quest
While they get the water
we dont want to be useless
We? Im fine
I dont want us to be useless
So were going to go try to find a table and some chairs
But we didnt get very far before Kris got distracted
Did we not know this was here?
Yeah?  I found a bike
That looks like a nice bike
Whered you find that?  In here
This is the coolest abandoned city ever
Having fun?  I am
All right Im going to go look for a table
Okay Lets go
How are we going to get the water out of this?
Its heavy
The thought process is that this is a house
And what do people have in their house?
Tables and chairs
Wait hold up
Look at this Dont move
Jimmy Jimmy
its a chair
Marks strong
A little help here Chan
This bag of water is over a hundred pounds
And so my buddy Mark being the science YouTuber that he is
had an idea to get it down from the roof more effectively
Our rope broke
We need stronger rope
What youre watching is real
Mark literally deleted half of our water
We got some bad news
Hurry up hurry up
The rope broke and all the water splattered on the ground
This was actually a very serious problem
Oh no
Are you kidding me?
Dont worry dude we got one bag of water left
Carry this one down please
And now that half of our water is actually gone
The only possible way to complete this seven day challenge would
unfortunately be to send two of us home
So Kris and Chandler volunteered to leave the city
leaving Mark and I with just enough resources
to make it the full seven days
Genuinely I would be scared if we left Jimmy
with anybody other than you
I think you got it  Oh you guys
But before they left
we wanted to have one final feast with the whole gang
Now thats a Feastables smores
My hair Yummy
Great melting point on the chocolate Jimmy if I may
If youve tried Feastables before the ones that used to look like this
you havent tried Feastables
Our brand new formula tastes so much better
Genuinely go to Walmart try Feastables
and tell me what you think
Its honestly way better than the old formula but dont take my word for it
I just worked at NASA so
Well I just had smores so I can go to the boat now?
And so we launched a flare to signal the boat
which was actually pretty cool
Bro look how cool that looks
Wait its lighting up the entire city
But the not cool part is now that Kris and Chandler are gone
its just Mark and I surviving in the city
I feel so lonely
Its our first day without our friends
But were going to make the best of the situation
Our objective for today is to renovate our shelter
Were going to put up tarps and windproof this room
Were going to build a fireplace in here and heat it up
Were going to find shelves and tables
Were going to make this place looks like a home
With some of the ideas we have planned I might stick around until day 14
Hes lying
And so we started exploring some nearby buildings
to find furnishing for our shelter
which is when we found this
awesome shelf this little table a massive carpet
and also this metal thing that was found by our camera guy
Look at this chair
That works still man
Bro Thats comf
I found a fake TV
We can make it look like we have a TV now
Its a good find
Wow thats just so cool
this like courtyard with the arches
Each building in this city has its own personality
What can we do with these?
We could use like a vent system like this
Combined with these we can make a fireplace
Like actual wallpaper
We have wallpaper
What do we use it for?
To make the house a home Jimmy
Its like we went grocery shopping but instead
we grabbed a bunch of 30yearold garbage
Honey were home
We found all this stuff
Now were going to start decorating
Were no longer surviving Jimmy Were thriving
I like that
We literally spent the next 4 hours
moving all the rubble out of our shelter
which made us pretty thirsty
The water in these sacks tastes like trash
which is why we all brought a Cirkul water bottle
because you can put a flavor cartridge in it
and make water taste good
This is my first time drinking a Cirkul bottle
Delightful experience
You can determine the intensity
So if youre feeling really audacious you can have level nine flavor
Or if youre just a wuss you can have a level one flavor
Im trying six
Six Ill match your six
That tastes awesome
Which flavor are you using?
Im rocking fruit punch because its got energy
And you know what we need right now Jimmy?
Thats right  Good thing Cirkul has our back
And now that we had been hydrated
it was time to start crushing these renovations
When everythings said and done
this room will be the greatest room in an abandoned city youve ever seen
This is our new shelf
All right lets see how she looks
See that? See all that dust?
Oh isnt that satisfying?
And now that the shelf is clean we can use it to store food
For some reason over half the food we packed is chili
And no one here likes chili
Thats the non chili row
Thats the chili row
This is the Feastables row right there
Now we have a table to put our Cirkul water bottles
Mark has a 22 ounce bottle This is the 32 ounce bottle
And they have a metal double insulated bottle
that you can get for free right now if you buy ten flavor cartridges
What a steal
Its not a steal Its free
All right
Thats going to block a lot of wind
With our new door in place
we also hung up this huge tarp
which will allow us to keep all the heat
from the fireplace inside our shelter
Oxygen comes in
fire burns sends heat in the room send smoke out
This is redneck engineering at its finest
Finally after being cold for so long
All right  Look at that
And we have a fire
I can feel the heat coming out
Wait Jimmy rigged this up in like ruins from an abandoned city
Anyway go to DrinkCirkulcomMrBeast
Or scan the QR code on his face if you want to order a Cirkul right now
This is the final room We have plenty in the corner
We have our beds that are now smaller
Tell me this isnt genius
This is Marks iPad in the TV frame
Obviously some nice lighting a furnace
that is heating up the room a real table with chairs
and a shelving unit with the scraps of food we have left
and a dirty towel weve been sharing
This is survival
But just as our night was going so well for the fifth day in a row
we heard a broken glass
Mark  Im right here dog
What was that?
Man we were having such a good day too
I want to go see whos upstairs
Im carrying the knife as a threat but Im not going to use it
Hey if youre up here just come out
I want to be best friends with you
Are you serious youre not pranking me?
Bro I swear to you it was not me
What is this?
Bro! Oh my God
This is the most Mark Rober thing Ive ever seen
What the heck? You swore!
Yeah so turns out Mark was pranking us
and he was the one dropping these bottles the whole time
Ive got a remote control here But no one suspects it
I can be in my sleeping bag
and I can start launching glass bottles through the roof
Freak everyone out
Oh my gosh
I thought I could trust you
Now that Marks not pranking me we rerigged his contraption
Feastables me
There you go
Ill take one
I got one as well
Thats kind of cool
To be honest it was pretty easy to forgive Mark
because we only had one day left in this challenge
Good morning
Good morning abandoned city
Abandoned city abandoned city
Its so much colder out here than it is in there
Lets go back
Its now the morning of day six
All the modifications we did were phenomenal
and it was at least ten degrees warmer
That was amazing  Slept incredible
Mark on our last real day I say we go have some fun
Yeah!  Yeah!
Jimmy is that a kayak?
I know what we should do with it
Now someone can kayak in this pool
Me and Mark really did have a lot of fun
Played baseball played soccer
Mark even taught me how to skip rocks scientifically
There it is
And even screaming at each other from different sides of the city
Mark!  What!
Lets throw things off the roof at the same time!
Great idea!
To be honest doing all these kind of dumb things
really did take our minds off of how lonely this city really was
And by the time the final day of this challenge arrived
after cleaning up camp we only had one objective in mind
Leaving this place and never coming back
Im here!
Im here!  Freedom!
Huge shout out to Mark  He didnt have to do this
He has his own channel is very busy
Heres the channel I appreciate you
And lets get out of here
Lets go
By the way Im giving away 10000 a day
for the next 20 days to people who buy Feastables
Go buy the new formula it tastes amazing
Sitting on these train tracks
is a quarter million dollar Lamborghini
And barreling down at it
right now is a massive train
But before the impact Im giving this Lamborghini to Blake
And on top of sending the train
Im also gonna have these eight soldiers
shoot 10000 bullets at your Lamborghini
Thats the scariest thing Ive ever seen
Yeah its gonna be fun
And you have exactly 24 hours to build whatever you want
to protect your Lambo from the bullets
The timer starts now
Okay first line of defense
Im thinking a wall of cinder blocks after that
some shipping containers filled with refrigerators
and then basically just a wall of cars
to block those bullets
Do you think all of this is enough
to stop 10000 bullets?
I think it is Jimmy
Okay but so far nothings there
You should get to building
So Blake immediately drove to three stores
where I gave him my credit card
and he literally spent 78000 on supplies
And since I dont wanna bore you with all that lets skip
to the part where everything was delivered
This first round of supplies are starting to show up
Oh my God I cant believe I bought all this stuff
And this isnt even everything man
Hes got a water truck
Some of his junk cars came in
Hes got a CONEX crate over here
How did he get this much stuff? This is crazy
Dont worry about the guys with the machine guns
Just pretend theyre not there
Yeah I dont even know what
theyre doing there honestly
Were five hours in and this storage container
is about to be the first line of defense
against 10000 bullets
Alright thats probably good Thats probably good
Do you think that shipping containers
gonna stop any bullets?
Absolutely not
So as of now hes screwed
Yeah its not looking good for him
Oh gosh
Its been about six hours Are you happy with your progress?
Im very happy  You sure?
It wasnt until this thing got down
but now that its down dude I feel really good
I asked him if this would stop the bullets
and they said no
And once Blake realized he had to go all out
he works not only through the night
This way Mr Railroad ties
Nice nice Yes
Really nice Really nice
But even into the next morning
upgrading his defense
Dude hes stuffing the storage container with a van
and a giant tube!
And once I saw it put together
I was honestly pretty impressed
Run me through what you built
So I built a whole bunch of concrete in the front
and the tallest part of the wall is right in the center
to block the crows nest machine guns
cause those things are big and scary
I got all my cars in storage containers
and a bunch of water
And if you come right over here
youll see his Lamborghini tucked away amongst everything
There it is Nice and cozy
Do you think all of this will stop the bullets?
Yeah I do
I think you have a 50 chance of survival
Thats the best odds Ive had yet
And before I have them shoot 10000 rounds
come with me to the Lamborghini
Not only are you competing for this Lamborghini
but for a hundred grand as well
What?  Yes sir
Yeah thats pretty cool huh?
This will be enough to cover the insurance
24 hours is up!
Eight scary men 10000 bullets
Versus everything that Blake has built
Are you ready?
Just get it over with Im freaking out
Were locked and loaded Ready to fire on you Jimmy
Sir fire at will  Roger that
Oh!  Oh my god!
They are unloading on his fortress
Oh my God! This is crazy!
Theyre actually ripping through
the cinder blocks now
Oh man Oh god
Oh Blakes walls are crumbling right now!
And what we havent told Blake is these guns are only
the first of four phases weve designed
to destroy this Lamborghini
or should I say whatever remains after this?
They just brought up the LMG
Oh whoa!
Oh its melting!
Cinder blocks are falling!
All it takes is one bullet to penetrate
and its going in his Lambo
Oh my God!
These are the last bullets
Ten thousand!
All clear? Lets go
Please be safe Please be safe
How is it?!
Shes clean baby!
Whoo! 10000 rounds and not one connection baby
Theres no bullet holes in your Lamborghini
And if you dont already know who Blake is
hes actually a contestant from our previous two videos
But today hes back for a third
and final attempt to win the grand prize
Are you ready for phase two?
See that giant crane coming?
That big yellow oil rig looking thing?
That is phase two
That crane is going to lift your car up a hundred feet
and then in 24 hours drop it
And you have to catch it without it being destroyed
Yeah Alright bring it over here!
And while we prepared the worlds first 100 foot
Lamborghini free fall
There goes your Lamborghini Blake!
Blake began to strategize on how he was going to catch it
I have no idea what Im gonna do
Chandler come over here
Yes Im here
How would you break its fall?
So you get all the pillows in the city
Step two get all the mattresses next get a blanket
Chandler youre just making a giant bed
Then a warm glass of milk
All right stop Youre not helping
Blake work your magic
Im screwed
Alright guys I got some good news and bad news
We passed day one with flying colors
The bad news is the Lamborghini is airborne
Okay? So anyone got any ideas?
I mean yeah hit me like what do we think?
The bouncy castles  Bouncy castles
That thats actually not that bad
Just becausethats not bad at all really
And after being inspired
by the construction workers wisdom
Blake had decided on his master plan
I would like to move the CONEXes in like a square
right here with the X in the middle
And that way I can just fill the square up with a bunch
of air mattresses pillows bubble wrap
and on top it all off with a bunch of bouncy castles
Just the biggest problem right now is I have no material
Everything that I bought is hard concrete or metal
And nothing that I bought I can use for day two
So I have absolutely nothing
And so Blake sent his crew to buy every pillow
and air mattress in the city
And even though he was incredibly sleep deprived
he got to work
Im already at the stage where its like Wait
why am I doing this again?
Oh yeah thats right Im in a challenge for a Lamborghini
thats floating in the sky right now
By the time his materials had arrived
Blake had been awake for over 24 hours
and was in desperate need of sleep
Im gonna try to get some sleep
cause Im exhausted and its four in the morning
And with how exhausted Blake was
he ended up sleeping for way longer than he planned
Is he serious?
He got mattresses pillows and blankets
But hes missing the warm milk
Yeah thats the key to everything
Where is Blake?
Hes asleep I heard
No he is not
By the time Blake got on site
it was already super late in the day
Thats Blakes truck pulling up
Alright we need to get to work Come on!
Alright lets just see what this looks like
Oh that bouncy house works as a big box
So Im thinking maybe we put that thing in the middle now
and then we start blowing it up
Only four and a half hours remain
and its not looking good for Blake
I dont think he has more than a 10 chance
of catching a Lamborghini
And even if he does theres no shot hes stopping
that train later on
Start filling up the side so that way its high over here
takes away this wall
So with only a couple of hours remaining
Blake did all that he could by filling the rest of his pit
with cardboard boxes and bubble wrap
Its coming down to the wire
Chandler how much time is left?
One hour
Blake is screwed
I have a little bit of bubble wrap left
I think Im just gonna get raised on this thing
and just wrap my baby up in this bubble wrap
and Im good to go
Thats definitely gonna help
Blake spent what little time he had remaining
on this crane failing at trying to bubble wrap his car
Its just not gonna work
You know what time it is?
Time to drop the car Lets drop this by boy
The failed bubble wrap makes it look majestic
Blake do you think your Lamborghini will survive?
Im positive Jimmy
He is more certain than me
Im positive about this one
I bought every air mattress at Walmart
If this wont catch it I dont know what will
I did everything I can
Heres a Feastables bar Blake
Ah thank you Mr
That way even if you lose the car
at least you have some good chocolate
Its available at Walmart Be sure to go try our new bar
Im so curious what you think
But anyway you have three bouncy castles 150 mattresses
how many pillows?  150
150 pillows and 2000 cardboard boxes!
Will it break the Lamborghinis fall?
Yes Yes
Thats two yeses  Okay
24 hours of work down to this no pun intended
3 2 1 Drop the Lamborghini!
Here we go! Outta my way!
That did not sound good
Please be okay Please be okay Please be okay
Please be okay
Alright Hes moving the CONEX crate out the way
Theres no way you caught that Lambo
Get these boxes outta the way!
Whoa!  What?
Were about to find out how damaged this car is
The lights work
Ooh the lights work
Yeah This princess castle might have
saved this entire car
Moment of truth
You mightve been the first person in history
to catch a Lamborghini
If it turns on
Alright here we go Here we go Here we go
Whoa it works!
I cant believe it! Yay!
Thats what Im talking about! Shes alive!
Everything looks good minus a little crack in the bumper
which we found out via official appraiser
This was only going to reduce the price
of Blakes Lamborghini by
Probably 10 grand
Thank you so much Thanks for the good news
Right nows the perfect time to mention that Phase three
is flaming cars
For Blakes next challenge
were bringing back his biggest nightmare
We have recreated the flaming cars challenge
that costed Blake everything last time
Wow thats a low blow
But seeing that hes done this before
were gonna up the stakes by dropping twice
as many cars as last time
Ill see you tomorrow  I got a lot to prove
Redemption day!
Blake spent the rest of the night disassembling his
defense for phase two
And after a good night of sleep he was ready
to begin his defense for phase three
Its eight in the morning
Just woke up We got a lot of work to do today
So lets get started
Heres the day three plan
Im gonna cut the bottom out of a shipping container
Im gonna drop it right on the car
Next Im gonna take two more containers
and Im gonna lead them up coming
to a point right above the car
And most importantly nothing flammable this time
Do you think that will deflect a car?
Yes sir
Oh I thought you were gonna say no
Blake then asked his crew to remove every piece of wood
that was in the container
because thats what ended his challenge last time
He then had them cut out the bottom of the container
that would surround the Lamborghini
The storage container could put a lot of damage
Completely crush it?  Yeah
It can?
I mean yeah that thing weighs a whole lot
And with that being done Blake just needs
to lower the container carefully over the Lamborghini
without damaging it
One scratch can cost some thousands of dollars
Youre good just like that?
It is so close to scraping the car
Watch your fingers Were coming down!
Yes! Yes!
I cannot believe that!
Next were gonna bring these containers together
to form a V
What if the car gets caught in there?
Yeah thats that cant happen dude
Thats why were putting this pointy thing at the top
Do you think that will actually deflect our car?
A hundred percent
20 minutes remain and then we see if that Lamborghini
perishes just like his 500 grand
And as usual Blake utilized every last second
3 2 1
Not quite sure what that dirt accomplished
Time is up  No!
Lets see if unlike last time you survive phase three
you lost 500000 from this exact challenge
How are you feeling?
I feel pretty confident
I think the viewers wanna know one thing
Did you put wood inside of there like last time?
A little bit
No Im just kidding Theres no wood in there
It was one of the biggest mistakes
Ive ever made in my life
Moment of truth Come on in
Three shipping containers
A bunch of dirt concrete
a weird like pointed roof thing
Versus 10 flaming cars!
Lets go dude
Light it on fire!
Will Blake be one step closer to going home
with the new Lamborghini filled
with a hundred thousand dollars or be eliminated
and go home with nothing?
Were about to find out
Drop it!
Oh oh!
Oh You did not want that
I feel like thats exactly what he didnt want to happen
Still feeling good?
Not as good
Yeah this is giving me some flashbacks
Its giving you some flashbacks
Alright ready for the next one?
Lets do it Lets do it
Drop it
Oh my God the roof looks like its already buckling
And just in case Blake loses the flaming cars
like last time Im gonna take this moment
and tell you about this amazing new phone
What youre currently watching on is
the new Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra
This phone can record slowmo in 4K
The camera on this is crazy
Were like 200 feet away and its nighttime
And look at that crystal clear
Ho ho ho ho!  And go ahead and drop it
Oh that hurt to watch
It also has a ton of new features
with Galaxy AI like Photo Assist
Remember the last challenge when the bumper
got cracked on the Lambo?
You can just circle it like this
and then all you do is you hit that eraser button
And just like that the bumper is fixed
Now I have a new car
For the picture you do
Whenever youre ready
This phone also has circle to search Google
which makes finding information incredibly easy
It wouldve helped Blake a lot in the last video
to learn about the flammability of wooden railroad ties
All he needed to do was long press the home button
highlight the railroad ties and ask Is this flammable?
As you can see railroad ties are flammable
You wouldve learned the answer instantly
Could have just told you
I was genuinely impressed
by this phone and I think you will be too
So go to samsungcom click the link in the description
or scan this QR code to check it out right now
and lets drop the next car
We dropped car after car
and with each one we could tell Blake
was getting more nervous but we also noticed that all
of the impacts were starting
to damage the crate itself
Your crate on the bottom is bowing
At this point the container protecting
the Lambo was being crushed by the weight
and heat of the cars
I thought about this every day since
the last time I saw this
And now its time for the final car!
Oh no!
Bro its gotta be a thousand degrees in there!
This cars probably melting right now
We got the fire extinguisher
Somehow hes running so fast Be careful Blake
Im coming
How is it?
Its okay Its okay!
Yes! You like that?
If one more car was dropped this crate
wouldve collapsed
You stopped 10000 bullets  Easy
You caught a car out of mid air
Youve now deflected ten flaming cars
Now its time for phase four
Bring on the train
The timer has officially started
I gotta go
Good luck on phase four
God speed
What is he even running at?
Blake knew that the train was going
to be the most deadly attack yet
so he wasted no time in getting started
I think the best way to stop a train is to derail it
Thats what Ive tried to build here
All these railroad ties are tucked snug
and all of these are gonna go under the train
The trains gonna hit em like that
And if I do that a hundred more times
I dont see the train just blowing past all that
The railroad ties lost me the challenge last video
This time theyll save me
I just need two inches off the track and I win
Two inches is a lot though
My man
And then once I have all this done
I can just put concrete on top
I think thats gonna work man I think thats gonna work
Blake worked with his crew throughout
the entire night and when I showed up the next morning
it was obvious that this challenge had taken a toll on him
Whats up Jimbo?
What happened to your voice?
Im like dying out here
As you guys know he lost 250000 in this video
He lost half a million dollars in this video
I think Blake is sick and tired of losing
He has an army going super hard
Theyre currently stacking the cars
that we dropped on phase three on the train tracks
But time was still ticking down
And in order to stop this train and take his Lambo home
Blake began adding a lot more objects
to the tracks like shipping containers mattresses
to cushion the impact
Blakes worked so hard Im now on his team
And water tanks
Blake really seems to know what hes doing
Too bad theres only 11 minutes left
At this point Blake did everything he could
to finish his build before time ran out
and it was actually starting to look impressive
This is it  Three
The final stretch
Two one  Last line of defense
Times up Stop Turn it off
Turn it off
Time is officially up!
Oh my God
From phase one shipping containers phase twos
mattresses and even phase threes burning cars
Blake you somehow used all the resources
from the previous phases
Lets see if youre driving home in a Lamborghini
or if Im dropping you off at your house
Bring that train on man Bring it on
Before we ram everything we need to back the train up
Were gonna go really far back
That way the train can pick up a lot of speed
before it hits everything Sounds like a good idea?
No that sounds awful
Be honest Blake Do you think
your Lamborghini will survive?
God I hope so Jimmy
And of course we had to put the Feastables logo
on the train
Its the best chocolate on earth
Do yourself a favor and try the new formula
but for now its time for the biggest moment
of Blakes life
Lets see if he wins a Lamborghini
Blake any last words?
Give it all you got
Send the train
Here it comes
Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God
Its coming!
Its gonna speed up until it hits 35 miles an hour
right before impact
Dude it is going quick!
Its just gonna derail Its just gonna derail
Here she comes!
Lets see if it was all worth it!
Oh wait wait wait!
Blake it derailed!  Wait I think it stopped!
Blake Ive never seen someone this happy!
Oh wow you derailed it!
Oh my God Oh my God I did it!
This is your new Lamborghini Blake!
Not only did he win the Lamborghini
but he also got all this money!
I did it!
You wanna know the best way to end this video Blake?
By them going to Walmart and buying Feastables right now
Its the best tasty chocolate on the planet
Third times the charm See you guys later!
We just launched our new Feastables bar
which is new branding and all new formula It tastes amazing
I like it
And to celebrate I paid a bunch of people
to make commercials for it ranging from 1 all the way up to 10000
And were going to see if more money equals a better commercial
starting with this 1 commercial
Its just a person moving it
Theyre filming their computer monitor
This is clearly a joke
What is that?
Why wouldnt you just record on your screen?
This is probably their way of saying
screw you for only paying a dollar
Yeah I cant imagine anybody would give you any care for 1
I mean to be honest for television
this is actually a lot of effort Oh its over
That was awesome
No if I ran that as an ad during the Super Bowl?
So far you get what you pay for
That sucked
Now lets jump over to the 50 commercial
Now its going to get better
Well as long as they dont start drawing it What is this?
At least theyre not recording with a phone this time
Theres no music
What do you want from these people? 50
At what price point do we get sound with our commercial?
Its getting better
Well it ended abruptly Okay
Didnt really get to look at it did we?
Surely the 100 commercial has audio
It does
Matthew No junk food
We need to start eating better
Who made this?
So just follow me and Ill lead you right to the healthier snacks
What is going on?  This makes me really uncomfortable
And I dont know why  I love this
Im in pain
Way too many words
I havent listened to anything theyve said
What are you doing in the candy section?
Looking at candy
Get to the point
Just look at these Sea salt Deez nuts
These arent even the new ones
The whole point of the commercial is our new bars
You suck
This is what it looks like now
Surely the 10000 commercial will be better
Lets see The 500 one
Dont mind if I do
Im down I love it
That was a cool effect
I like that Oh the hand
This is the best thing thats ever been created
That was pretty good
I mean imagine youre flipping on TikTok
and then you see someone just go Feastables
After watching that commercial
Do you want to eat this amazing chocolate?
Yes  Well yes I do
Its nice to have a Feastable
Id love to share a piece with you
I love jingles
Its really the least that I can do
This is fire
MrBeast has made a treat for me
And you
How did I know?
Oh its popping up Pop off
He could have made the background a little cleaner for 500
Im sorry What is?
Yeah for him to clean up his room and like
iron the shirt in the background
Thats Thats 1000
For 500 I dont want to see a single Funko Pop in the frame
Wait did he add that in or is that
just a plate with a Feastable score?
I genuinely cant tell
You know what? Just because of that its worth the 500
Thank you sir
MrBeast asked us to make a commercial for Feastables
The budget was 500
We made Feastable smores instead
Best decision ever
We also made this
Oh this is really good
This is the first actual real commercial so far
Thanks for the chocolate Feastables
Youre welcome
I mean it had beautiful shots but that wasnt really an ad
That was more of them just saying hi to me
Lets see how the 750 commercial turned out
Beast anime
This is so cool
Thats really cool
This is awesome
All right Ill say it  I was going to say it
Ill say it It was a little short
Well animation takes a long time
I agree It was awesome I love the quality
It made me look way cooler than I do in real life
All that just a little short
That was 750
I wonder what the 10000 one looks like
Its so good  Yes
This is really uncomfortable
I dont think we should put this on TV
This is a commercial
Nothing makes me want to buy chocolate like rats eating it
I cant tell if this is good for our brand or not but its funny
All right now the thousand dollar commercial
Were dropping thowees
The zoom in
Tareq would nerd out about this
Tareq is like All right  this is the best one yet
Oh that was sweet  Im sorry but
Im not kissing somebody just so I can eat chocolate
They bought a jersey High effort
Oh no He is out of Feastables
If youre wondering where you can buy Feastables go to Walmart
Go to Walmart
Now were starting to get to the beefy price point
I thought it was chocolate not beef  My bad
Well its a film set
That looks cool  I like this song
This is a meta commercial The whole point
is shooting a commercial about shooting a commercial
I mean they make the product look good
There we go
Thats a cool shot
Oh it fell Ha ha Quirky This is still going
I mean you paid a lot of money
I did pay two grand so
Why was that funny too?
He just poured milk on it
Oh that was the ending
I dont get it
My head hurts
Hes got veiny hands
I understand why his veins are popping out
Look how tight his watch is
Jeez tight watch
Youre going to cut off circulation
Needs to clean the nails a little bit Im sorry
All right first the veins second the nails
3000 He couldnt go get a manicure first?
I think your nails are fine
Hey tight watch?
I respect you
Oh thats a pretty shot That was it?
What? I hope your watch falls off bro
Now its time for the 5000 commercial
Whats after 5K?
The 10000 commercial
Loud equals funny
If you were me four years ago
I thought that was not chocolate
Are you eating my Feastables?  No man it wasnt me
I can see it all over your face
It isnt even feasible that I feasted on the Feastables
Ive been on the farm all day fantasizing about those Feastables
Its an entirely new formula
It is brownie points for mentioning the new formula
Brownie points for his cheetah print pants
Hey guys wheres the dog?
Told you
Oh now hes eating his Feastables
That is better
I dont like  I love that
Find your favorite flavor from milk chocolate milky milky milk crunch
Milky milky
Theyre better than dog
Points off for swearing  Yes
More importantly though I want you to comment down below
Did that make you want to go buy chocolate from Walmart?
Thats the best one yet
Now we have a second 5000 commercial
We sent everyone a bunch of our new bars
and on top of that if they requested me to film footage
I filmed it and sent it to them
This is the first one to ask me to film something
Lets see how they use it
Well its got a dog Im already on board
Tell me that my bad vibes are hitting the streets
What is going on?
This is going to change the world
Some point well see the Feastables chocolate I assume
Or not Maybe they just
Okay there we go  Yeah!
We finally see the product
Deliver these and make them smile
Whats in the briefcase Happy Feet?
Im going to be saying that for the rest of my life
Look theyre doing good deeds now because theyre MrBeast
The world will never be happy
Bro what in the?
Did this guy think we wanted a movie?
Because I told them I wanted a commercial
That was a good shot
Delivered to the world
That was you  That was me
They asked me to film that clip
They literally went out of their way to ask you for a onesecond clip of you?
And you put in 1 effort into it
Feast like a beast Feastablescom
That was really a lot of effort
And now the moment youve all been waiting for
I know I have
Lets see what a 10000 commercial is
Better be good
I got some Trick or Treaters
Trick or Treat
They took the whole thing
This guy looks like hed steal some chocolate
The product looks very good in that shot
Oh no Bisexual lighting
This is shot so well
Its a pirate Oh gosh
Are they going to steal more candy?
Trick or Treat? Im a banana
He just cant get enough can he?
Wait watch Hes going to rering it
Hes going to have a different costume on
Oh I knew it
Twick or Tweat
That was really uncomfortably gross
Man didnt I tell you to get
Happy Halloween fellas
Yeah that cowboy just looks like people I went to high school with
Thats him
Thats the guy who stole my candy
Im down for this
I like this
Worlds best chocolate
I mean
I I
To be fair I gave them chocolate bars with no direction
I dont know if this would convert to sales but theyre funny
So if these commercials made you want to try Feastables
go to Walmart and try our milk chocolate bar
our milk crunch bar our almond bar our peanut butter bar
our dark chocolate bar
our dark chocolate sea salt bar or our peanut butter crunch bar
All seven flavors are now available at Walmart
Go give it a try and tell me what you think
Do it or I wont like you
Well punch you
Whatever were ending the video
This is a 250 million private island
Literally anything you could ever want is on this island
And Im going to show you the difference
between this and a 150 million luxury island
a massive 45 million island a 5 million frozen island
all the way down to the cheapest private island in the world
That thing Im starting to realize might not all fit on it
First step on my brand new island
Heres your dollar
Thank you for selling it to me  Its yours now buddy
Lets check out what I just bought
My first impressions
is that its a lot smaller than I thought
When you pay a dollar
you get a random pile of bricks an old toilet
I found the restroom
And a bunch of random wooden poles
Theres more poles than square feet on this thing
Theyre actually called pylons
Lets pile onto that boat and leave
And as you can see theres nothing here so Im going to blow it up
But later in this video were going to a 150 million island
and also a quarter billion dollar super island
But first were going to head over to the 1 million dollar island called
Monkey Island
Yes you heard me right
This island is literally swarmed with hundreds of monkeys
I can see why its called Monkey Island
Whats this monkey?  Its Odie
Odie took my orange
Monkey see food monkey take
All the monkeys on this island
have a strategy for interacting with people
They gaslight you into thinking
that youre friends and then they steal your food
You can have it You can have it
I love this monkey
Theres a monkey on the boat
And if youre wondering where are you
and your friends are going to sleep on this island
Suspended above the water are six luxury cabanas which house
both humans and monkeys
The monkeys grabbing the GoPro Jimmy
Sir we need this for filming
I just need to borrow this
Thank you Okay
I got my camera back You want Oops
He wants your hat
Okay you can have that sir
By the end of this Im going to be naked
The monkeys are stealing everything
And the monkeys are not even the coolest part of this island
See this island isnt even an island at all
Its actually the top of a massive underwater plant network
that emerged from the sand and water
to create this illusion of an island that we see today
Is this a milion dollar island or a million dollar bush?
Because theres no land  What do you think?
I dont know
I think an island is what you make of it
And on the other side of the island theres even a private relaxation area
And a beachfront massage parlor
Im trying not to fall in the water
Im about to get a massage with a monkey
Notice how all the water around you is freezing
That took a lot of effort
And we put that much effort in to convey
that the 5 million Island is very cool
And where were going next most of the year looks like this
but its going to look like this
No joke
This island is so cold right now that the lake surrounding it
is actually frozen solid which means to get there
were going to be using an interesting vehicule
Were literally hovering
Apparently snowmobiles would have been too basic for this island
It just had to be hovercrafts
Talking about arriving in fashion
And it only took about 30 seconds
being outside the hovercraft for the gang to be frozen solid
How cold is it?  Its zero degrees celsius
Its pretty cold man
Hes more like a 70 guy
So they hurried over
to these futuristic selfheating huts to stay warm
Oh this is so small
Wait theres no room for you in here
Were gonna have to cuddle then
And these huts are able to stay here completely year round
because theyre able to both float on warm peaceful lake water
But they also do just fine in the dead of winter
But at least in the winter
you get a great view of the northern lights
For 5 million you basically get a winter wonderland
And while staying on this island
youre given unlimited five star food
I think he thinks we speak Finnish
And even though this island comes with a luxury cabin to stay in
Oh this is beautiful
Fine Ill take it
Jimmy buy it for me
The gang ended up spending most of their time on the frozen lake
where they were able to ride an actual dog sled
He took your glove
Oh my Gosh!
This is the best island
I dont know how any island is going to beat this
Maybe one where I could feel my hands
And Karls hands are in luck because this next island is not only warm
but more expensive than all of the other islands combined
This island is tiny but arguably one of the most
luxurious ones out there
Okay lets go check the house
Were stoked to have you as our guest
We hope you have a blast Just dont break anything
Yo we should try to break one thing
Oh nice bathroom
Usually rich people like showers that can fit like 30 to 1000 people in them
This time they chose a reasonable shower
When you pay 16 million
in addition to a shower thats the size of the 1 island
the private island comes with this helicopter
thats apparently too big for this island
We have jet skis
We have a submarine Another submarine to the right
We have a shark submarine over there
Theres almost a submarine for each of us
Boys do whatever you want Have fun Youre out You
Yeah! Yeah!
Im going really fast
I love private islands
Karl if you had one wish what would it be?
To get off of this thing!
Were underwater!
I am a fish now
After Ludwig and Karl kissed the sea at 500 miles per hour
we went back to shore to take a little breather
Ludwigs going to jump out of a helicopter
He really is
No wait Im not Wait what?
Any last words?
I love you Mom Im sorry
This helicopter
is taking the boys up into the air
and letting them jump and freefall into the ocean
This is crazy We shouldnt be doing this
This is only a 16 million island
and were jumping out of a helicopter
Hes about to jump
Oh wait! They jump!
There he goes
Whoever said money doesnt buy happiness
doesnt own that private island because Im pretty happy
And now the 45 million island
this island is so big you cant even fit it all in frame
Oh hey I didnt realize they were waiting on us
Hi!  Hi!
I always feel uncomfortable when I pull up to places
and people are just standing potentially for hours waiting on me
We have some blueberry smoothies here
Is it alcoholic?
No its not
Hes not 21
now well take you guys up and well show you around Royal Island
a little bit
Lets see what 45 million gets us
Its a long path
The path is longer than the last island
For 45 million
this island comes with a mansion and its own
beachside bar and private chef
Can I give it a flip?  Sure
Thats not too bad
And outside of the mansion is a hot tub
overlooking the cove where the jet skis are
and of course a pool with the best view Ive ever seen
Does this look as cool on camera as it does in real life?
And if for some reason you dont want to stay in the mansion
theres five luxury beachside cabanas you can pick from
Jimmy may I?
You may
May I?
I have class
But even after messing around with all of the amenities
Why are we playing ping pong when we have an entire island?
Its important to note that thats not what makes this island special
All the way at the other end of
the island are centuryold ruins that we are yet to explore
Dibs on driving
All right ready?
Were going to go off roading a little bit
and head to the back of the island now
How does Karl always end up driving?
Because Im awesome  Big bump!
Dude this is like a safari
Yeah youre going four times the speed limit
I mean I dont know if theres cops that will stop you
but Im just letting you know
Is there a jail on this island?
No Jail
Oh theres no jail?
And when we finally ran out of road to drive on
we started to make our way through
what used to be a village of people
on this island over a hundred years ago
This used to be a bar?  Yes
You want to walk under this 100yearold giant thousandpound slab?
Sure surely it wont fall on top of me
Dude if today was the day that itd fell you couldnt even be mad
Nolan come over here before you die
And just past the ruins is easily the best view on the entire island
Yeah it gets better
We were driving for so long
I forgot we were on an island
The island starts over there comes all the way around
wraps all the way around here
Goes down that coastline all the way up over there
Ill be honest I wouldnt
pay 45 million for a big jungle with some ancient ruins
But Im sure some rich guy will
This next island is arguably the second most expensive island
that money can buy
This is the 150 million island
It comes with eight luxurious mega mansions
And the best part is
it is completely powered by solar panels and wind turbines
Its home to some of the most exotic animals Ive ever seen
and took over four decades to build
This island will literally blow your mind
When I think of a private island this is what I think of
Thats good because this is a private island
And apparently the first thing you need to do here is wash your hands
Make sure you dont taint the island with your outside world germs
Ive already washed my germs
Does everyone who come here gets a coconut?
I mean theyre not running low
I dont know if its because this place is so fancy
Or maybe they just heard about Karls driving
But each of us ended up with our own personal driver
I have a feeling this is going to be a onceinalifetime experience
Unless you come back  That might be out of my price range
And even though this island costs 150 million
you can actually rent it yourself
for the extremely low price of 140 grand per day
I didnt even realize we just went up a mountain
Ive heard this is the most luxurious private island in the world
It is
The view is insane  This is the great house
But before we were able
to explore the great house my dumb friends got distracted by a turtle
Theres a turtle?
Get in there
All right you guys go to the rest of the island
This island is so extra that for every one person
in your party they have ten staff members waiting on your every need
Theres a bunch of people over there like heres drinks heres food
What do you want to do over the next few days?
And were just like turtle
And of course
Nolan of all my friends wanted to take advantage of this
Yes! Yeah!
Whats everyone up to over here?
Were playing pool
With 10 people?
Theyre my hype crew
You dont have to hang out with him to make him feel good
I will be sad if you dont sit down and relax
If you need attention dont make them stand there
Its only been an hour but Ill say it
This is the best island so far
On top of all of that
the island has a house with a driving range on the roof
where you can literally hit golf balls into the ocean
Because these are made of fish food
You should probably hit it further so you dont hit someone
Look at all those flamingos Theres so much I cant process it
Flamingos in the sky
They are everywhere
They dont love us unless we give them food
Come here my brethren
But flamingos arent the only exotic animals on this island
Bro  Thats a dinosaur
And believe it or not
this turtle could theoretically live over 200 years
Mr Tortoise my name is Jimmy
If my descendants descendants descendants come here
Tell them I was awesome
And afterwards
we got swarmed by a bunch of lemurs that live on this island over here
Get over here!
Jimmy I dont know if you noticed that theres two lemurs on your head
Yeah I know Im trying not to move
Ill put food on there  Please dont
And if youre wondering where all these exotic animals came from
most of them sadly are endangered species and are all on this island
because the owner
Richard Branson brought all of them here to help prevent them
from going extinct
But the most endangered animal on the island
were the mermaids that serve you sushi
Mermaids and sushi
This is luxury
Do you guys want sushi?  I wouldnt say no
Is that cannibalism?
Its like a family reunion Get over here
Theres honestly so much on this island
We cant even film it all
We play tennis we play basketball
We explore yet another mansion
I did my first cold plunge
You get the idea
Theres so much to do on this island
Its actually overwhelming
This ones actually pretty intense
Im like actually scared
You know what else is intense?  What?
The final island Ill see you there
Why are we still here?
And on the way to the 250 million Island
we stopped in shark infested waters because I have to pay for this video
And now that Im surrounded by sharks
and what feels like my worst nightmare
Im going to tell you guys about Stumble Guys
Bro theyre so close
And the worst part is Im not coming out until Im done with this ad
Stumble Guys is a freetoplay mobile player game
where 32 people compete for the crown
You have to be an absolute maniac to do this
Not even Stumble Guys could pay me to do this
Why are you all here sharks?
Theyre so close theyre so close
And for their new season
they went all out with the new MrBeast skins
animations and emotes
Okay square head have it
Bro this is nuts
I want to make sure theres enough sharks for Jimmy
They also added a brand new level
but you have to follow a pattern as long as possible to stay alive
And the longer you live the harder it gets
Is a shark hitting me?
I think the sharks are hitting the cage Its rocking!
Oh this is scary
Not only that
I also just released my new toolkit so you can build your own MrBeast level
This is one of their best seasons ever
You need to try my new MrBeast level plus build your own
And I want to see what you guys come up with
The sharks keep hitting the cage So Im going to get out of here
Make sure to download Stumble Guys for free
so I dont have to go back in the shark cage
Youre alive
Lets go do more things that have nothing to do with sharks
And now that Ive paid off the debt Ive incurred from this video
lets visit the 250 million island
This extraordinary island has an entire amusement park
with over a dozen waterslides
It also has its own hot air balloon and just about every activity
you could imagine
And we have it all to ourselves
There are no other guests here but out of every feature youve seen
on these islands so far this one stands above the rest
In the middle of the island is a massive waterslide
even though literally eight year olds ride that waterslide
I might still chicken out because Im afraid of heights
But before taking on the water slide
we checked out the other features like how theres over
a hundred jetskis on this island
Its a bit overkill
And not to mention
theres a literal zip lines that span across manmade beaches
Whats the helmet for?
What am I going to hit?
The ground bro
Because sometimes people fall off
This is like really scary  Yeah
Good luck  Thank you
Karl youre kind of far behind
This is actually not that crazy
And if you own this island you can host over 13000
of your friends at any of these five gargantuan pools
Oh this kind of looks like it was made in Minecraft
And its so funny just seeing my two friends in it
Nolan looks like a tiny speck
For 250 million
this island of course has exotic animals
Is that a peacock?
Sir I need to take you in for questioning
And even every game you can imagine
I wish there is the 13000 people that are normally here
to watch how bad he is at Cornhole
Is that soccer pool?
This island has things I didnt even know existed
But something I noticed is there were way too many lifeguards
at this island for just the four of us
How many lifeguards are on this island?
Over 100  Really?
With this many lifeguards you would have to try to drown
So I thought itd be fun if we gave them all the day off
Has anyone ever rented this island before?
No one
This is the first  Dude you are leaning back
You look way too relaxed
And after all 100 lifeguards went down
they decided to hype up the boys and I for our turn on the slide
Here we go!
Boys you want to know whats even scarier than that?
That one
Why is it so terrifying tonight?
It looks so scary
We can skip it
Towering at over 135 feet tall
This is the tallest water slide in all of North America
I dont even know what Im looking at
Its like a skyscraper
But Im scared
Daredevils Peak What a soothing name
Very inviting
Were so up
Its kind of freaking me out
All right we made it to the top
Are you guys just waiting for us up here?
Listen to how intense the wind is up here
Oh dont look down
Look how crazy the island looks Oh my God
Karl!  No
Nolan! Oh!
Would you say nose goes is enforceable?
Nose goes is enforceable
There we go!
The lifeguards said you got to go Nolan
I love you Mom
Ill see you on the other side
All right go
Oh I got hit by a truck
Lets do this
You better come down after me
Oh God
Why is it so fast?
Is it actually that scary?
Im going to do this for your entertainment
even though giant rides scare me
Here we go
That is going so fast
And even though I was basically just drowning
the entire time down this waterslide
I gotta say this whole island was pretty awesome
Mark Rober Today I helped MrBeast
conquer his fear of heights
It all started when I gave him
a tour of my secret lair CrunchLabs
and after I showed him what I call the firemans piston
he started to reveal his true colors
MrBeast Oh no
Bro Im terrified
How high is this?
Mark Rober Turns out the dude
who spent 50 hours buried alive
was wimping out over an eight foot drop
Im scared
Mark Rober But if he just had more trust
in the laws of physics
he wouldnt need to worry
cause when you step off
you pull down on the rope
and it pulls up on this plate
but all the air in the chamber here
has to get squeezed out of this tiny hole at the top
and that creates a traffic jam
And just like traffic jams in real life slow down your car
this one will slow you down to a nice easy landing
You just reminded me that Im deathly scared of heights
Mark Rober At this point I could have
put him at ease by telling him just how many five year olds
had already made the jump
but then again watching him suffer was way more fun
Mark Rober laughs MrBeast sighs
Bro I hate this
triumphant music crowd cheers and applauds
Im never doing that again
There you go You got your freaking video
I just bought this train
and it is currently barreling fullspeed
towards that giant pit over there
Were also crashing countless cars
blowing up thousands of sticks of real dynamite
and even putting 10 jet engines on a car
Just to show you the most insane experiments of all time
Starting with filling a house with over 100000 fireworks
Please do not try this in your house
For this experiment
each of the boys will hide a dummy in my new house
to see if its even possible to survive
Water and fire dont mix
my mannequin is going to survive
Mines in the fridge
Go in come on
Lets blow this house up
Hey be careful
If you accidentally press one the house explodes
Oh my goodness  Please
Wheres your mannequin?
Bathtub  Fridge
Under the washer
Tareq?  Front porch
Oh yeah its sitting right there
This is gonna be the coolest thing
you have ever seen in your life!
Yes! 5 4 3 2 1
Fire in the hole!
What happened to the house?
I cant even see it anymore
Oh my god!
I dont think our mannequins
are gonna make it
The house burned all night
until there was literally nothing left
including all the mannequins
Next experiment
Were about to play TugofWar
between this real military tank
and these two school buses
And the loser gets dragged into the pit
Theres no way the tank loses
Were probably gonna lose
No were not
Now obviously people cant be in these vehicles
cause theyll die when they fall in the pit
So this remote actually controls the tank
This feels illegal
3 2 1 Go!
Im full throttled right now
Youre done for!
Oh!  Oh were screwed
The buses are done for
Oh my god
Do you hear the buses beeping?
Its horns going off
Were gonna go investigate the bottom of the pit
to see the buses
Oh god  Oh no
I need to stop looking down this is
Stop moving!  Im not moving!
Were in the pit
Oh my gosh Bro look at that
Whyd the bus think it could beat the tank?
I dont think it did
Later in this video
a trains gonna come off those tracks
and land right about there
But before we do that this is 50000
and it is surrounded by thousands of pounds of TNT
And this is Will
Whats up guys?
See that crate in the field?  Yeah
Oh man
That is around 1 of the explosives
surrounding this money
Are we safe standing here?
Uh yeah youll be fine
Heres my credit card
Spend as much money as you want to protect this 50 grand
I dont care if you use wood bricks
or even steel to protect this money
Whatevers left of this 50 grand
when that TNT blows up you keep
Good luck building walls
All right lets make 50000!
I dont think he stands a chance
The first thing Will did
was buy 12 industrial water containers
and filled them with 20000 pounds of water
Im really worried that Jimmys TNT
is gonna get through this
And he should be
because this isnt even close to enough to stop the TNT
Meanwhile were gonna test another experiment
In a previous video we put a jet engine on a car
and it jumped eight buses
So this time we put 10 jet engines on the car
and were to see if it flies 10 times further
When this car flies off this ramp
I think its gonna go past all the buses into the trees
I think its gonna hit the first bus
Our guesses couldnt be further apart
Hes currently matrixed into the car
so he sees what the car sees
Chris!  Hey!
Oh should we move?
Yeah were sending a rocket car
Oh okay
Send the jet car!
The cars coming straight at us
I lost signal
Maybe we should jump?
Now Im straightening it
Yeah!  What the heck?
Whoa! Wait wait
We broke the ramp!
I think it was a success  Yes
The jet car easily cleared all 12 buses
and literally left a crater in the road
I love how this block of engines
just on the road
Yeah its still smoking
Oh its leaking  Oh and its smoking
And now were back at the giant pit
If you jump in this deep pit
and land on a thousand bouncy balls
would you die?
Id love to know Nolan catch!
Catch what? What are we doing?
You completely missed!
Luckily we have more mannequins
Will it survive?
Pay attention!
Oh Oh!
Oh buckets!
Hey Jimmy!
What if we dropped the car in it?
I think you know whats about to happen
Clearly that mannequin didnt survive
Next bit
Meanwhile Will was desperately trying
to protect his 50000
Hes honestly taken this way more seriously
than I thought he would
In the past four days Ive hired some professionals
and weve already built the cinder block wall
filled it with matches
and were already on our second cinder block wall
This dynamite is not getting through
You blew my expectations outta the water
How about this?
If you let me double the TNT Ill double the money
So a hundred grand double the TNT
Yeah but if it blows it up you get nothing
Take the deal! Take the deal!
Okay! Okay!  Its a deal baby! Deal baby!
And while he kept working the boys and I went bowling
And the bowling balls are these cars
Im ready to see some destruction
Lets see if I get a strike
Hey first bowl a strike
Oh its not going straight
Oh its coming in our direction
We should move We should move
We should move  Nolan watch out!
Oh into the field There it goes
Oh its turning around
Oh its coming back!
Oh God  Its coming back
The cars got a mind of its own!
Its coming back!
Take number two
Oh thats a perfect strike
Whoa!  Lets go!
I love cars hitting things!
And if youre wondering
the other car is still going in circles
During this bit me and the boys
have been wearing some brand new designs
which you can now buy on our new store
We switched from ShopMrBeastcom which was very long
Move over! Move over!
to MrBeaststore
Oh my gosh!
Ooh!  No way!
We just about died
Im gonna show you how to just hit a full strike easily
All right Here comes a strike baby
A store domain is the perfect choice
for anyone looking to sell anything online
That was the worst throw yet
That was the best throw yet!
That was awesome!
If youre looking to set up a store
it should be at store domain
so your customers clearly know that your website is a store
This is Carls car
Unlike com MrBeaststore tells the world
that the website is my store
Dont forget to head to MrBeaststore
and buy our brand new merch right now
Since I doubled Wills money and TNT
hes completed a sevenlayer fortress
of 20000 pounds of water mattresses
a cinder block wall four mattresses
a second cinder block wall
an additional 32000 pounds of water
all packed in with a final wall of dirt
But I actually have another layer
that Jimmy knows nothing about
Jimmy will never see this one coming
How am I supposed to blow up Feastables?
Thats the point
And with the TNT doubled
its time to put Wills bunker to the test
I also brought number 40 from 1 throughout 100 back
to help us blow up all this TNT
Youre in charge of the button
Dont press anything yet
Oh god
Whenever youre ready press the one
Im nervous
Oh that moneys gone for sure
Bro look at that smoke cloud!
I cant even see anything Is it okay?
Wait I think I see money falling from the sky
Seven days of work just went up in flames
I dont know if Ive got this
I gotta see if my moneys okay!
Why are we running?
Im running cause hes running
Oh my goodness!
Oh theres so many stacks!
We counted out the money
and over 95000 survived the explosion
I just won 95000!
Congrats on the 95 grand
Lets go see what happens if you drive a train into a pit!
Yeah!  Whoo!
And nows the moment youve all been waiting for
a train is gonna go fullspeed down those tracks
into this giant pit
If you were on this train where would you sit?
I put my mannequin in the cabin
Statistically the safest place to be on a train
All right you got this
All right were gonna sit him right on the front
Youre not going anywhere
Were gonna give the Feastables bar a front row seat
Stop eating Hersheys Eat Feastables
We have waited our entire lives for this moment
This is going to be epic
Nolan send the train!
The trains coming!
Lets do this!
Oh my god Here it goes!
Oh my god here it comes!
Whoa! Look at that!
That might have been the coolest thing
Ive ever seen in my life
Yeah my mannequin didnt survive
Train versus pit the pit won
I hope you enjoyed the video
Lets end it with an explosion
That is so hot!
Mr Beast
This is my old Feastables chocolate bar
And as you know it tastes better than a Hersheys bar
Now I know what youre thinking
Jimmy why are you in engulfing
your old Feastables bar in flames?
Well it all started about one year ago
I was in a Feastables business meeting
and I realized tasting better than Hersheys wasnt so special
Doesnt everything taste better than Hersheys?
Like literally doesnt anything
on the planet taste better than a Hersheys bar?
Yeah  I think so
None of you felt the need to tell me this?
If everything tastes better than Hersheys what makes us special?
Yeah well the answer is nothing
And to be honest
myself and my entire company werent exactly fans of that harsh truth
So I set out to do something better
And whats better than being better than Hersheys?
Am I fired?
Well how about being better than everyone?
The best on Earth
And from that day forward we worked tireless
Like Im talking barely even sleeping
I travelled from country to country
chocolate factory to chocolate factory
Tried out thousands of formulas
Which eventually led us to this
The best tasting chocolate ever made by mankind
also known as our brand new Feastables bar
This is the best tasting chocolate on Earth
Good job boys
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
How do we know thats the best tasting chocolate in the world?
Why did he say that?
Youre fired
I was just going to say that we do a blind taste test
Wait a minute
We should prove it in a blind taste test format
Thats genius
Youre rehired
So I set up a random warehouse
where Im going to invite hundreds of strangers
to do a blind taste test of our brand new chocolate
All four of these pieces of chocolate have no branding
and theres no labels distinguishing anything between them
The only thing they are voting on is taste
So now its time to see how our new chocolate formula
holds up to three of the top European chocolates
I like the first one the best
Of course she picked Feastables
Im going to go with the first one  Yep
It has a really nice bite to it
and its a little bit richer than the other ones
Im not even surprised by what shes saying
Another one  I like that a lot its really good
I would eat that every day
That is what an intelligent man looks like
Its a weird taste I havent tasted before
It reminds me of like
Its not Hersheys Hersheys is not that good
Better than Hersheys Spot on
This might bankrupt Hersheys
That chocolate Im pretty sure
Another one
Back to back back to back
To be honest we just keep winning
Its boring
And the new bars come in seven flavours
Milk Chocolate  Thank you
Milk Crunch  Yes please
Peanut Butter
It used to be called Deez Nuts but you know
Peanut Butter Crunch  That one
Dark Chocolate  Mine
And Dark Chocolate Sea Salt
The new bars are available nationwide in every single Walmart
Go give them a try
Weve genuinely put a ton of effort into these
And if you spend your money on Feastables
I really want you to enjoy it
And starting February 17th for 30 days straight
were going to be giving away 10000
to a lucky customer who scans the QR code on the back of any new Feastables bar
So go give the new bars a try
You might win ten grand
And I cant wait to see what all of you think
GO TRY A NEW FEASTABLES BAR! YOU COULD WIN 10000!
Behind me is one person from every country on Earth
Were going to see which country is the best

Now that everyone made a goal
Do you know whats happening?  I know whats happening
Chandler bring it on out!
The real challenge starts now
Its about to get a lot harder
I think this is where well lose our first person
Thats too tight  So much on the line
I thought it was going to be easy
Its only like six foot wide
Someones getting out
Come on Slovenia!
Hype them up everybody!
Even though we made the goal smaller they were still scoring
Were going to have to make this much more difficult
Nobodys missing
Eventually someones got to miss
Oh no!  The first miss
Im sorry man But youre eliminated
That hurts
I dont know where he ran to
And now only six remain
Instead of adding more walls
were just going to move them like this a little bit
It needs to be one Chandler wide
All right Slovenia youre up
Yeah  Wow
The heat just doesnt stop
Take your time
Theyre dropping like flies
I could have done better but
it was the best five days of my life
This is getting harder now
Yeah this is a competition
And now only five remain
Im going to win you!
Yeah baby!
All right Samoa Youre up
It could all come down to this
The fans think its Samoa
Samoa! Samoa!

not to be able to win but it was phenomenal
I think I did my people proud
Im sorry man
Every country on the planet has competed in these games
And were now on our final two Libya and Slovenia
One of you is going to walk away with this 250000 gold medal
Jimmy is going to do a plot twist
Its a big one
Boys can you remove the walls?
Instead of walls
You each are going to take turns being goalkeepers
We go until someone scores and someone doesnt
Pretty simple  Im going to catch it
That faked me out  That faked me out
Hes ice cold
Well after that now he has to make it
He blocked it!  Yeah!
If you make this shot you officially win our Olympics
I cant believe this
All you have to do is make the shot and youve won
Im going to win

Its 20 pounds be careful
The golden medal I cant believe this
You can probably sell this for 250000 tomorrow
And Slovenia gets silver
Silver is my color though  Congratulations!
And thats it for first Olympics
Not only did they get these medals
but everyone who competed got 2000
I hope you enjoyed See you in the next video
This is for Libya!
This is the largest shredder in the world
and this Lamborghini is going to fall in it
Were also nuking an entire life size village
shooting real tanks at a literal Lamborghini
and crushing this store with the worlds largest domino
This is the first of many experiments
Youre going to love this video You ready?
Ready!  This is going to be crazy
All right Theyre falling
Come on
All right its working
Its actually working
Are we going to have to run?
You hear the thud?
Oh its going
All right that was the tallest domino in the world
That was the new tallest domino in the world
Down goes the domino!
That was insane!
That was crazy!  We were way too close!
This isnt even the coolest thing were doing in this video
Were detonating the biggest explosion in YouTube history
launching a rollercoaster off its track and so much more!
Lets go to the next experiment
We got a lot of experiments today
And up next
were going to destroy an entire village
with a massive creeper explosion
And just for reference
a human sized version looks like this
Oh!  Oh okay
But were going to be detonating one 50 times bigger
Steve somehow you survived the last creeper
This one Im not quite sure youre going to survive
We dont believe Steves going to make it?
Oh heck no
Even though this is 50 times bigger it has 200 times the TNT
Bye Steve
Okay lets head in the bunker  All right Steve
Lets send Steve into the abyss
Just so you know how big this creeper is
Steve is actually taller than me
Hes getting close  Were in the Green Zone
This is going to be a massive explosion
Its getting closer any second now
I dont know when its going to happen
Oh Im scared
Oh my God  Im speechless for once
Im still processing that
That was insane  How are we allowed to do this?
We live in a country called America  Go America
If you thought that was cool I got news for you
Its about to get a whole lot cooler For our next experiment
I bought another Lamborghini
Adam this is your Lamborghini  Thank you
And youre probably wondering though whats the catch?
Yes Thats exactly what Im wondering
How do I put this?
Recently I may have obtained a military grade tank
In exactly three days
Im going to be raining missiles on your new car
And you get to use my credit card
to spend as much money as you want trying to defend it
If the Lamborghini survives you have a brandnew car
Im going to spend whatever it takes to defend this Lambo
Thats why I gave you my card
Okay fine Im going to do it
A lot of things racing in my mind right now
but its simplified into Stop Shell win Lambo
Adams first move was to call a construction crew
to bring in building materials and help him set up his first wall
Im going to want all the walls to kind of be a foot over my head
Thatll at least protect the direct shots on the Lambo
Now for the second part of my process its going to be the pool
There was a MythBusters episode
where they were shooting rounds into a pool
so that should stop the velocity heavily
Adams got a lot of work ahead of him to keep his Lambo from danger
And speaking of danger
we bought the worlds most dangerous roller coaster
And if youre wondering why its dangerous
Basically I put bombs on the ride
In theory if you were to ride this roller coaster
you should get launched off this rail
The only question is where would you land?
Lets see how far it goes when it gets launched off it
And obviously before we launch it were going to put mannequins on it
Everyone put your mannequin where you want
Hes got a good head on his shoulders
And the final touch
Push! As hard as you can!
All right get out of the way  Go! Go! Go!
All right there it is
This things going fast
All right Now its going to come down and go off the ramp
Here it goes
Go go go
All right Hold up hold up hold up
Oh that actually scared me
To be honest I thought it would go further
That was cool and all
Lets do that again
but with an explosive in the cart
Inside these boxes theres dozens of pounds of TNT
When were done pushing run to the bunker
You dont have to tell me to do that
Go go go go Were going
All right Im running
Go guys Go!
Go quicker  Go go go go go!
Get inside  Its going down!
It might not have flown 100 feet but at least we blew it up
But that explosion is literally nothing
compared to what youre about to see
For the next experiment we have three safes
one that costs 1000 10000
and finally the 100000 safe
Its bigger than me
And were going to see how many explosives they can resist
These are actual explosives
Why is Chandler bringing them in?
Hes my dealer
Okay  Carefully set it down
I know this doesnt look like a lot but this is 1000
For however much we spent on each safe
we spent the same amount on TNT
And were going to see who wins this 1000 safe
or 1000 in explosives
Im going to put an egg inside the safe
Lets see if it turns into scrambled eggs
Usually during explosives we have a wireless switch
This time its hardwired
That actually scared me
Well the egg in the safe literally dont exist anymore
Lets try this again
with 10 times the explosives and a safe 50 times stronger
this thing has threeinchthick steel
Grab a crate of explosives
This is like explosive Jenga
Were like putting presents around a Christmas tree
The last egg did not survive
Lets see if a 10000 safe can protect it
Is this safe really worth ten grand
if it cant protect an egg from TNT?
I dont know if safes are meant to stop TNT
This button is hot  You want to hit it?
I do 3 2 1 go!
What? Oh my  Bro
The next one is supposed to be 10 times bigger
Than that one
which was ten times bigger than the previous one
Oh my God He put a divot in the ground
Yo can you guys believe Nolans mom fell right here?
It broke the glass on the hundred thousand safe
In hindsight I shouldve put the safes further apart
Ever since we were born weve always wondered
if you put 100000 worth of explosives around 100000 safe
would it protect an egg?
The ageold question
Youre in luck because Im about to answer it
So heavy!
This safe is now surrounded by 100000 in explosives?
You could say its unsafe now
Out of every explosion weve ever done
what youre about to see is the biggest by far
Our videos have gone so crazy that people think we fake them
This is a real explosion
Three two one
I dont even have any words
We woke up everybody in the city  Everybody in the entire state
Lets see if the egg survived Oh my gosh
Bro the back of the safe is gone
Bro it broke the foundation
Its all cracked in the floor
It seems like they put all their effort
in the 37000 pound door and not the walls of the safe
And the egg did not survive
If you ever want to rob a bank
just buy a hundred grand worth of TNT
in the meantime Adam had been going all night building his structure
Its like 200 am still so hot out here
And when I came back in the morning
I noticed he had some pretty interesting ideas for it
Adam! What am I looking at?
Scrapyard had a lot of cars
Im going to have at least two layers of cars
and Im probably going to stack them
The real secret is Im going to be using the engine block to stop it
That should give it more stopping power
than just the side of a vehicle
So far Adam has two cinder block walls
two layers of stacked cars and three pools full of water
all just to protect this Lamborghini from the tanks shot
What do you think the odds are that the Lambo survives?
That Lambos mine baby Were going to get it done
But I wasnt about to go easy on it
so we brought in extra support for tomorrow
Boys! Bring them in!
Now that we brought in two more tanks
the Lambo will be targeted from all sides
Adam doesnt stand a chance
You have a little less than 24 hours left
Good luck Adam
Youre going to need it
All jokes aside I am actually stressed out about that
If Id known there were going to be three tanks
I wouldve strategized completely different
While youre building were going to go test the tanks
Oh great
Kris Do you want to do the honors?
Yeah  Too bad
The test we built consists of a hundred pound safe
a trampoline and bulletproof glass But
Did it go through it?
Oh I can literally see through it from back here
This is the weakest of the three tanks
Adam is screwed
While Adam was wrapping up his protection
for his Lamborghini
were going to throw one into a shredder
And to show you how powerful it is
Im going to shred some other stuff first
Karl send it  Here we go! Yeah
Lets see what happens
Oh yeah!
That is so awesome!
That doesnt sound like piano noises
I think we need to wash down that piano
I agree Send the coke
Im 99 sure these are going to blow up
Oh there it goes!
And while were doing this
I want to tell you guys about Creator League
Its a gaming league brought to you by eFuse
and eight of the biggest gaming entertainers in the world
Its like having a front row season ticket
but youre not just watching
Youre actively drafting teams
changing strategies and sharing in the reward
Up next we have a Hersheys vending machine
Ill do you guys a favor by getting rid of it
There it goes
There goes the Hersheys
Is it stuck?
Turns out not even this massive shredder
can digest Hersheys
When you purchase a Creator League pass
youre able to influence the league
compete at weekly tournaments win prizes
and potentially even meet some of your favorite influencers
And if you sign up in the next seven days
youll receive a free box of Feastables
Im grabbing the porta potty
Who taught Kris how to use this stuff?
Creator League gives you full control over what games creators play
Kris drop it!
Whos on each team
What are the rules and so much more
Oh it smells
Weve been in this junkyard for 10 hours
and even I took a poop in that earlier
One Creator pass equals one vote
and you have full influence
over almost everything they do in the league
Click the link in the description down below
and sign up for Creator League right now
while we clean out this shredder to get it ready for the Lamborghini
were going to go shoot another one with tanks
And things arent looking good for Adam
because he was running into a ton of problems
on his last night of filming
Were hitting some issues We need some things
Nothings open not being able to get enough resources
This is my last bricks
I cant believe we even got these done
three tanks is just impossible
I got to work through the rest of the night
I wouldnt forgive myself if I went to sleep now
Hi Jimmy
Please tell me youre not still building
Can I get five more hours?
Over the last 24 hours
Adam has managed to stash 20 more cars
build four more walls to the sides
and he also put two more giant pools
But you went out of your way to build this pool
but didnt fill it up
Yup I ran out of time to fill it up
You should learn time management
Yes I should
Noticing a lot less cars over here
Oh I see you put sand in here
Does it make it harder to push over?
Itll be fine
Bro do you just not want the Lambo?
Its going to work
This might be the last time we see this Lamborghini in one piece
Stay strong
Ill be back soon
And Ive obtained 20 real tank shells
Dont ask me how
And were not going to stop firing until we use all of them
The boys are loading the tanks
This is going to be awesome
Why is mine so small?  You know why
The moment of truth
Are you ready? Three two one
Oh One of my pools
We got a pool
No no no
Our first shot literally hit the pool in front of the Lambo
The water poured everywhere
How much water did you put in those pools?
Oh this is gross
Im still holding out faith
Hey this one at the same time
All three  Oh my God
Adams walls make it impossible to see the Lamborghini from here
So until we run out of ammo
we have no idea if his car made it or not
I felt that one  Yeah this is not good
Reload the tanks Kris
Your defense is not holding up there
This is not good
Im kind of grasping the straws at this point
Ive done all I can do
Fire in the hole
I have way too much power
I was so confident today too
I love how is just rapidfire tanks right now
My only hope is that theyre missing
Anyways what were you saying? Last shot
Adam this time you dont get a choice
You have to pull  If Imma go down
Imma go down looking like a G
Oh hes running!
Adams car its done for
I cant see
Come on!
Wait Are there no holes in it?
Man lets go baby!  You did it!
Whats crazy is even though the cars
arent strong enough to stop the rounds
they were able to deflect them
away from the Lamborghini
Theres a bullet in the pool  Oh my God
Theres a bullet in the pool
The pool right in front of the Lamborghini
caught a bullet for you
Thank you MythBusters
I owe you this but Imma keep the Lambo
Oh will he fit?
Hey he fits!
Hey were gonna make it work
Thats fine Were gonna make it work
Congratulations on the Lambo
Lets go shred another one
And now the moment you savages have been waiting for
This hunk of metal is going in the worlds largest shredder
Is it time?  Its time!
Lets drop it
Karl are you ready?
Ready!  Send the Lamborghini!
This suspense is killing me
Oh my God  Its hanging over the edge!
Lamborghini versus the worlds largest shredder
Its about to Oh!
Look at it It looks like its dancing
This is the coolest thing Ive ever seen
Bro our buildings shaking
Oh The cars fighting back
I think we need to push it down
Its stuck in the Lamborghini tires
so the cranes going to push it down
Shred the car Shred the car
Its doing it
Oh my God All right
And that is what a shredded Lamborghini looks like
Dont worry it didnt work It was decommissioned
Subscribe because we have some insane videos coming up
and Id hate for you to miss them See you later
Every year over 200000 children
are born without the ability to smile
and even worse breathe properly
99 of people are born like this
with a full ability to breathe through their nasal airway passage
However the other 1 look like this
with a cleft lip or palate
which makes life terribly difficult
for these children as they grow up
In poorer areas there is no way for many of these people
to get healthcare meaning thousands of them
grow up without ever having the opportunity to receive surgery
which results in bullying and social isolation
But there is one organization
that is making a big difference in communities all around the world
Meet Kathy
40 years ago my husband and I
were asked to go to the Philippines
We landed in sites one after the next
and we saw 300 children with cleft lip and palates
We just didnt know what to do
We said lets do what we can
and we were able to do 40
The rest we had to turn away
So we said to ourselves
okay well we should go back
We should at least finish
This was the start of Operation Smile
and in 40 years
theyve been able to achieve over 400000
successful surgeries for patients in 36 countries
all around the world
However in Mexico the number of
cleft cases are quickly increasing and
becoming difficult to maintain alone
They desperately need our help
So Darren and Dan flew to
Puebla Mexico a city with rich
Latin history and culture
On their arrival Dan got the rare opportunity to showcase
this incredible city from above by being invited
to ring the cathedral bell at first light
They were welcomed by Mauricio
I started with Operation Smile 11 years ago
One of the reasons
why I wanted to dedicate my life into nonprofits
is because in Mexico
theres a huge gap between people
that can actually have access to any surgery
I met a young lady
and when she came to one of our surgical programs
she had a bruised eye
They threw stones at her
because of the way she spoke
It just broke my heart
This is one of the consequences of a cleft
I always say that behind the patient
theres a story
and behind the story you have a human
And I decided to dedicate my life
to the cleft cause in Mexico
We met a young child and he is one of the sweetest kids
Ive ever met in my entire life
But he has a terrible disfigurement on his face
And this child is so sweet
and so loving
but it breaks my heart knowing the bullying that
he is going to face as he grows up
One of these patients is Emmanuel
17 months ago he was born with a bilateral cleft palate
He is the son of Jernimo
a single father who lives in
the rural mountains of Chiapas
The cost of health care has
proven to be extremely expensive for him
as he barely makes enough money to support his son
Meaning that his only hope is to travel by bus for 17 hours
to Puebla for the only
chance of being selected for a surgery
And if not selected it may be the last chance Jernimo
has to get this opportunity for his son
If you look out at any one
of these programs what we see are masses
Its not like 10 children 2 children
Its masses of kids and families
We screen these families
You know we look in their face
But if you look down
you see no shoes on their feet
They will do anything for their child
I can only imagine the pain
for a parent when they have
a child that desperately needs a surgery and they cannot afford
to provide it for them themselves
And when we saw just how difficult
this was for these families
we knew we had to help
So we decided to pay for
over 100 surgeries
The next day after the screening process was complete it was time
for the patient selection
Jernimo was extremely anxious because
he wasnt sure if his son would be selected
Today is a very emotional day for me
Behind me we have the patients
and were going to do the surgical announcement
They are about just to be told
that theyre going to be having
a life change forever
97 patients had already been selected
and Jernimo started to lose hope
It was time for patient number 99
He did it
Just look at the relief on his face
Seeing the hope in these parents faces when they bring these children
to this clinic knowing that theyre
finally going to get the medical
care that they need is truly an experience that moves the heart
Emmanuels surgery would take the whole day
So while the doctors operated
Dan and Darren went to explore the city
We were walking through the park
and we just found a Mariachi band
And its always been a dream of Darrens
to join a Mariachi band
So hopefully I can make his dream come true
My friend over there
he wants to join the band
I got you a hat
I think we have to shut this down
This is terrible
That was one of the greatest experiences of my life
That shows you how boring Darrens life is
Emmanuels surgery is now complete
And this will be the first time
Jernimo will ever see his son smile
One of my favorite moments in
the surgical program is when
the kid comes out of surgery
Because this is the first time
that the parents are going to see the kids with the surgery
Its just such an emotional moment
Because you change the life not only of the patient
but the family and the society
Our patients are going to have
the opportunity to actually have a normal life
A healed cleft means that all
of these children will grow up
not having to worry about being bullied
And on top of these extraordinary surgeries
Operation Smile also provides all of their patients with free speech
and vocal therapy
Meaning that they will learn how to speak clearly and fluently
But we had one more surprise left
Kathy told us about a young nursing student Fernanda who was treated
by Operation Smile 17 years ago
I knew I wanted to study nursing
because I wanted to help kids like me
When you go home
You tell your family that they dont have to pay for you anymore
Were gonna give you a full scholarship
And well pay for you to finish your nursing school
I think youre going to be an excellent nurse
Thank you  Thank you vey much
Dan come over here
Alright look at this man
If you dont subscribe
he will literally cry right now
Dont worry they subscribed so you dont have to
Just end it like that
And one more thing
Operation Smile is amazing
and theyre doing incredible work all around the world
We want to help them continue
to be able to provide these
surgeries to children all around the world
In other words if you dont donate to Operation Smile
you just hate kids
Jimmy The Bermuda Triangle
is one of the most dangerous places on earth
Over 100 ships and planes have gone missing

sad music
How do you liking the Bermuda Triangle so far?
Its pretty dangerous to cameras
The only thing thats gotten hurt so far
in the Bermuda Triangle is literally our 7000 camera
I stubbed my toe
Honestly Im kind of enjoying it
Maybe its cause were on a yacht
but it doesnt seem that bad
The reason why all those sailors
and Amelia Earhart all went missing
cause its so nice here
Why would you leave?
Maybe the reason why this place is so dangerous
is because they dont have trees
Teamtreesorg or donate below the video
Were almost at 20 million
Now that all of you guys are fed
its time for the next challenge
As you know things in the Bermuda Triangle
typically go missing
So lets play hide and seek
You should count the 10000
cause youve already done it
Jimmy Im going to go count to 500
You guys hide whoever I find last gets 2000
Ooh Okay
So Im in my room and Im going to begin counting

The look on your face was priceless

We know someones in the closet
How we mess with them?
We need Febreze and just start spraying Febreze

Jimmy Surprise!
All Together Surprise!
Happy birthday! Yay!
Chris Hey buddy
You guys are sharing this room
Oh yeah arent you glad you found us?
Im very glad yes
Cause I was upstairs and I saw someone
but I think it was a crew member
and I was in my underwear
Jimmy While the seasickness
the camera falling in the ocean
and Chandler winning three challenges in a row
were all bizarre occurrences
we still werent convinced it was the Bermuda Triangle
But later that night we managed to get some footage
of some disturbing stuff
Hey Chandler
Chandler did you hear that?
I think I heard something
Thats okay
Got my trusty sword
Im going to sleep here with my sword
Tareq Conner can you see?
Conner No

Tareq Oh thats not your bedroom?
Viking Excuse me Excuse me
This is my bed room
Tareq Thats your bedroom?
Yep All right well good night
All right Jake indistinct its currently 700 AM
Chris did we survive the Bermuda Triangle?
Chris I barely survived last night
Its cause you stayed up all night playing video games
Blade why dont you have pants on?
I was woken in my awoken sleep
Wrapping a towel around your waist is easier than pants?
Chris Its a blanket not a towel
I was told I was needed
Just going to go over here
Were heading back Its a little wavy
Im going to throw up
I feel like Im going to throw up
You want me to throw up on camera?
Tareq Not again
We made it
Never going on a yacht again not that I can afford it
I got sick a lot
I almost threw up
It turns out the only thing dangerous
about the Bermuda Triangle is motion sickness
and terrible tripods
Man Singing Mr Beast 6000 Oh oh
Mr Beast 6000 yeah you know his name
He changed it once or twice but I think its here to stay
explosion exploding
In this video
were going on a 250000 vacation
This is beautiful
How is this real?
And Im going to show you the difference between
this and a 100000 presidential vacation
Right this way sir
A 50000 vacation where we have the Eiffel Tower
completely to ourselves
Im holding on for dear life
All the way down to this 1 vacation
Right over here boys This shack is our vacation
You can see inside of it  Theres no walls Jimmy
Well I mean there is walls  This is gross
And in case you dont believe me its a dollar
Look at that  Oh its 093 Youre a liar
I rounded up to a dollar For 1
we get this bed which is honestly just a mattress
sitting on wood planks
a broken cabinet a light that sort of works
Oh look at that
And lastly random noises coming from the ceiling
I was hearing noises in the room and theres a raccoon on our roof
I feel like most people would be mad if their hotel room had a raccoon
But for some reason were happy
When is the check out time?  Tomorrow
Keep in mind that later in this video
were going on a 100000 vacation
A 250000 vacation
Can we just jump to that already?
No because we got to suffer
so they can compare our suffering to our happiness
They do like when we suffer
Are we all supposed to fit on a single bed?
If we wanted four beds thatd be 4
First lets get all this sand out
The raccoon just ran in here
Im gonna act like I didnt scream like a little girl
Up next
a vacation thats 10000 times more expensive
Welcome to the 10000 a night vacation
Oh my gosh  Yo this is sick!
Wait what the heck is this?
This hotel room has jellyfish
Okay thats so unnecessary  Oh theres a pool outside
Its a private pool
Does this not look like a scene from a movie?
Your hotel room walks out to the beach
Wow  Is this our own private beach?
This is incredible
Tareq since when is water this blue?
This all inclusive vacation also has a giant spa
Oh yeah
A park filled with flamingos
Oh theyre fighting
Flamingos  And unlimited room service
Okay what do you need?
All of it
The only negative of this place is it doesnt have a raccoon
Hey little guy
But I dont blame them for that
When you spend 10000 at this all inclusive resort
we each get our own floor of the building
It looks exactly like Jimmys except for I got the top floor
Oh I have a hammock
I think I can make it in the hammock without getting wet
I didnt
Yo look at your view!
Chris!  Hey
I caught it
3 2 1  Hey!
All right let me lay out some rules
Rule number one  Yeah
No more throwing pillows in my pool
Rule number two
Sorry Tareq And now what the hotel is known for
this insane infinity pool
that extends over our own personal beach
How does the water just not overflow?
I have so many questions
I feel like a father that took his kids on vacation
and is just watching them hang out in the pool
The 10000 vacation has been insane
but not as insane as our next vacation
all the way across the planet
And now the 50000 vacation in Paris
Oui!  Baguette!
Our 50000 vacation
starts with a completely private luxury ferry ride
What is that? Thats the engine?
Bro what is this 1805? Tareq zoom in on that guy
He is filming us Hey
They waved back  Do you have a YouTube channel?
I dont think he speaks English
This vacation comes complete with fantastic food
A tour of the entire city
And a luxury hotel room with an amazing view
This is kind of romantic huh?  Yeah
You and Chandler should kiss
And lastly we have a very expensive surprise
So you guys are probably wondering
its a 50000 vacation
and we clearly havent spent 50 grand yet
Yeah where is it?
Its behind you
Thats the Eiffel Tower
Yes We have the entire Eiffel Tower completely to ourselves
Wait actually?
What portion of the 50 grand was the tower?
Almost all of it
We are at the Eiffel Tower
This feels like were sneaking in
No Im not joking Its ours No one else is here
We can just go straight through the line
Most of the time this place is packed with people
And because we have the whole thing completely to ourselves
were going to try to get to the top of the tower
Im talking the very top
Boys enough playing around Lets head up
On the way up
we stopped at the first floor over 187 feet in the air
where we had a world class restaurant all to ourselves
I love though even though we have the entire Eiffel Tower
they still put us in a corner of the restaurant
Thats the elevator
coming from the top of the Eiffel Tower
That looks terrifying Open sesame
Thank you I can see my house from up here
Were in France
I can see my hotel from up here
Look how high up we are  Oh my ears are popping
What are we working with here?
You can see the whole city from here
This is crazy
Tareq Look how much higher we have to go
This is never going to end
Im not going to lie I thought we were already at the top
Were going up
Now were heading to the top At one point
this was the tallest building in the world
Should I jump right now?  No Do not move
Come on boys follow me
From here on out theres no more elevators just stairs
Oh its windy up here
We are high up there Oh my God
Tareq dont drop the camera
We are standing over 900 feet in the air
The highest point civilians are allowed on the tower
But since its ours for the night I had one last surprise
What do you thinks behind this door?
Actually did I
How did you know?  We can see the stairs
Well yes there are more stairs
but this takes us to the very top
where no ones allowed to go
Are we allowed on that?  I dont know
Oh that is scary
The ledge just comes up to my waist up here
I am holding on for dear life
I completely understand why tourists are not allowed up here
We have a cameraman on the other side of the city
with a lens zoomed in on us
Hes over a mile away
If this lens is good enough
you should be able to see us waving for a 50000 vacation
You got to admit this is cool
This is amazing
Ita a once in a lifetime experience
Are you ready for the best moment yet?
I dont know why a YouTuber has this much power but lights
Oh there we go
Like a disco show
Holy cow!
Guys I dont know if this next command
is going to work but turn every light off
Oh its pitch black
The Eiffel Tower went dark
What are these millions of French people thinking right now?
They should get me off this tower
I dont know why they gave me this much control
Next we head to Switzerland for the 100000 vacation
But this is no ordinary vacation
This hotel has two inch thick bulletproof windows
a panic button that will lock down the entire building
and its riddled with security because this is a hotel
where world leaders and presidents take their vacation
And also the sidemen were in town So I invited them to come
It smells like food in here
Weve got the whole ocean in there
What?  This is nuts
This is the most expensive penthouse suite in all of Europe
It covers the whole eighth floor has dozens of rooms
tons of staff waiting on you day and night
and absolutely crazy food everywhere
You want a hit? Yeah get a hit of that
How do these guys compare to your normal guests?
So youd say theyre pretty dumb compared to
Like I said before some of the most powerful world leaders
choose this place for their vacations
Even Bill Clinton stayed here and he wasnt assassinated
Its pretty safe
In terms of security here you have the bulletproof windows
Even this is bulletproof
Oh my It feels thick
Pretty solid
I hope Im a president
There are also some snipers
that we can put on the rooftop
You have your own snipers
Are you able to negotiate on behalf of the Sideman?
I can try my best  Yes
This will help me in my negotiation
Id like to buy a 10
How much boys?  Go you say it
200 million Jimmy
200 million
All right To the panic button
Oh no  Im not going to lie
Ive been wanting to press this button since we got here
We all agree this is a good idea
No  No
Karl Youre Bill Clinton and you feel threatened
Press the panic button You pressed it
I see a door closed  Are we locked in?
Is it locked?  Are you guys in there?
Is that Nolan?
Yeah The doors like shut
I walked off for one second
This button opens it
You dont get to panic and then open it
If you press the button now
the police will come
And theres a big fine
Dont press it again
Ive been thinking
How would a president get somewhere like McDonalds?
Lets see how presidents travel Come on in
It turns out when youre the president
you have to go everywhere with your bodyguards
So that means that when you drive
Oh we got an entourage
How do we know which car to get into?
On the third or the fourth
Ideally the third or fourth
Which car is the most dangerous?  The first one
Nolan you should ride the first one
I can do that  Okay
Who wants to ride with me?
Harry come on in
Harry Chandler
Im sure the president doesnt sit in the middle
Typically you guys would be my bodyguards
But you know youll suffice
Just squeeze in mate Squeeze in
What president is going to McDonalds?
Does your window roll down? Hey hows it going?
Now were gonna get shot!
I cant believe we can do this
This is nice
Turns out when you travel in a presidential motorcade
a lot of people start to notice you
Hows it going?
This is bonkers man
I love how we just draw the attention of everyone
People are filming
like were the president This is weird
Which made McDonalds a little awkward
Whats going on?
Dont mind our security
Jimmy does this beat out the Eiffel Tower for you?
Depends how good these nuggets are
Obviously all of the vacations
so far have been amazing
but they pale in comparison to the next one
Our final vacation is once again across the planet
And now were in Japan for the 250000 vacation
and were meeting up with a special guest here
so youre gonna want to watch till the end
To start off our vacation
we dropped off our bags in the most expensive hotel in all of Japan
This is gigantic
I have an echo in a hotel room
we felt like getting to know the city of Tokyo
Now were going to drive Mario Karts on the street
We rented private Mario Karts
but we get to literally drive on the streets of Japan
People are just staring at us
This is not meant to be on a street
Theres real cars driving right beside me
Well look how many people are crossing the street here
This is the busiest
crosswalk in the world and were driving right through it
Were on Gokarts in Tokyo Gokarts!
I love Japan
This place is crazy
When we arrived at our next destination
we met with master swordsman Yoshioki Sumida
Hes been training with the katana for the last 26 years
and he actually agreed to giving us a rare lesson
in the art of the Samurai
We each got our own katanas
and the lesson began with swinging techniques
It was not as easy as we thought
No theyre going to zoom in on it
Then it was my turn
Boys you think Im gonna be able to do this?
Yes  Yeah you got it
Hey! Lets see how the boys do
Whoa whoa whoa!
Who am I?
And then our samurai teacher gifted us this insane katana
I dont deserve this but thank you
And because this is a quarter million dollar vacation
we rented out the most premium sushi chef in the world
along with this entire floating restaurant
They got Louis Vuitton coasters
The chef makes all the food right next to our table and getting to see
a master at work was one of the coolest dining experiences
Ive ever had
Oh wow
They said we could feed the birds tuna
Here you go little man
See how he caught him in the air?
And once we paid the bill
we were off to the craziest place Ive ever been
Follow me I rented this whole place
But before we see it socks off
This is basically an art museum but for experience
I have goosebumps
My eyes are having a hard time processing it
You think this is what it looks like when you die?
What is this next room?
Normally this place is completely full of other people
but we secured the entire experience for ourselves
This might be one of the best things weve ever done
Dude are these fish?
Were in a pool
in a museum playing with animated fish
This is the most unique thing you could ever do on a vacation
Wait the fish are surrounding us
How did they know to surround us?
They love us
Theyre going everywhere now
Now youre all probably hungry
Which is why were at this restaurant that is ran by robots
My name is Pepper
Can we have a seat Pepper?
Sure Lets find a comfortable spot
Weve reserved the entire place
so the only other people here were the robot waiters
Food robot is here
Wait so the food is delivered on a robot?
An oddly fluffy robot
Pepper staring really hard at Chandler
Pepper does not like Chandler
Bro I did nothing to you
Everyone make sure you eat tons of food
cause tomorrow I rented an entire theme park
and PewDiePie is going to be there which is really crazy
You see PewDiePie and I have a long history
I was wondering when you would show up
We helped him in a subscriber race against Tseries
Grab your phone
Go on YouTube search PewDiePie and subscribe to him
Eventually we even caught up to him
Mr Beast has taken over me in subscribers
I guess Im getting a taste of my own medicine
Thats all right He definitely deserves it
And even though weve been friends for a while
weve never actually met in person
And because this is such a long awaited meetup
I rented this entire amusement park
This is FujiQ Highland
the park with the scariest rides in all of Japan
It usually has thousands of people waiting in line
But as per usual
I rented the whole thing just for us
You can ride whatever ride you want
I wasnt done but he left
Im about to go on this entire roller coaster alone
What youre seeing here is the steepest roller coaster drop
in the world
Are you scared?
Yes  Have fun!
Im scared for him
And like I promised
the father of YouTube PewDiePie met us in the park
A little later than planned because I texted on the wrong day
Sorry Felix
And he wanted to ride the craziest coaster at the park
Why are you scared?
Im so scared of roller coasters
This is one doesnt spin at all
Ill ride it if Felix rides it
Lets go!  Im terrified
Ill do it Ill do it
If I die on this roller coaster you guys are going to feel terrible
You take your shoes off?
Anything that could fly out  Thats how you know this is bad
They dont even trust us with shoes on this ride
You got this Youll be fine
I cannot
This was my worst nightmare
Im scared I dont want to do this
Youre scaring me Calm down!
Whatever you do dont throw up
Im terrified Can we pick a better one?
We could have picked a nice comfortable ride
I actually have no idea what it is
At some point theres a literal 90 degree drop
Youre freaking me out What did you sign me up for?
You brought me here
But what we didnt know was
this ride goes backwards
Why are we going backwards?
Why did I do this?
Oh my God Were upside down!
This is crazy!
Best roller coaster ever!
Felix what did we just do?
Im crying
Best roller coaster ever
I got tears just running down
It was good meeting you Jimmy Im gonna head out
You screamed at the first little bow
I dont think Ive ever had a chewy potato before
Thats what you get for passing me
Felix Im sorry for passing you
You dont have to threaten me with violence though
Theyre good  Yeah they are good
That was the 250000 vacation
Felix can you transition us?

See you in the next video
Subscribe if you wanna go to Ohio
My friend Mac is about to experience the scariest moment of his life
Im just going to let you know Im not afraid of anything
Well see  You cannot scare me
Seal him up
You have to survive 10 minutes with a thousand spiders to move on
Release the spiders
Start the timer
The reason were doing this is because
Mack said no matter how hard I tried I cant scare him
Would you say youre scared now?
Getting there a little bit
A little bit?  Yeah
And this is only one of many fears Mack will face in this video
Oh good
And if he can successfully face all of the fears he will win 800000
Im not going to lie
this was way more gnarly than I thought it would be
Lift it up Lift it up
Congratulations on passing the first challenge
But Mack has to finish all of these fears
if he wants to win the 800000 prize
Mack I know youre blindfolded but trust me
Just walk up this ramp
Raise us up
Why are you taking a knee?
What is?
Stand up Stand up Youre fine Youre fine
No no no no
All right Jimmy
Okay you can hold on to it
Thats cute
Mack take off your blindfold
Welcome to challenge number two
The next fear is the fear of heights
Youre going to stand on the end of that plank
unclip this so youll be connected to nothing
Nah dude
Press that button and then freefall 200 feet
and without knowing how trust Ill catch you
No! No!
Youre shaking
Yeah of course Im shaking
Im going to fall off of this without a harness on
Yeah  I cant even see the ground
Be very careful
Mack Im just going to tell you
even though you cant see the ground you are very very high
Oh my God Mack
All you have to do is unclip it and press that button
I want you to look at me in the eyes right now
and tell me that Im going to fall and somethings going to catch me
Something will break your fall
I promise
Youre literally attached to nothing
The clip is gone  Oh my God
You dont have to do it
If you want to
you can tap out and just admit that you are wrong and
you do get scared
No way
God dude
I would have to say you look pretty scared
three two
I cant believe you did it
Hes a psycho
And if youre wondering who my psychotic friend Mack is
hes actually a contestant from a previous challenge video
And sadly he ended up losing 800000
But now he is on challenge three of six
to attempt to win that money back
Here we are
Yeah  The next challenge
Whatd you get? A 5 car and put 800000 inside of it?
As you can see this car is pointed towards a lake
Im guessing youre going to want me to drive the car into the lake?
No That would be dangerous
As you can see theres no gas pedal
Obviously you cant drive it in the lake
Yeah Im so stupid
Why would I think that I can drive it into the lake?
Yeah Yeah  Stupid Yeah
Which is why were going to drop him in the lake
Bring in the crane!
Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy
It is getting real now Okay
All right Mack listen up and listen good
Once we drop you at this lake the car will quickly begin to sink
And in the back seat is
the 800 grand youve been competing for divvied up into eight duffel bags
However many bags you can save from this sinking car determines
how much money youll continue competing for in this video
And whatever you leave behind is gone forever
Oh my gosh dude
I will never tell you that Im scared
but Im about as close as you can be right now to that feeling
I can tell
Before we drop your car Im going to give you a one offer
If you quit right now and admit I scared you
Ill give you 100000
And we call it even
Hes not going to take it
Theres not a gosh darn chance  I knew that was going
Hey Nolan take that I knew he was going to do this
I lost it all last time
Its not happening again
Drop him!
Hey Mack! Youve got about 20 seconds to break out of that car
before it sinks under the water
Mack the car is going under
Hurry up
That car is gone
That sunk so fast
Oh my God Hes out Hes alive
Hey Mack!
Nolan go grab that bag from him
Somebody grab this
The scariest part about this challenge is every second
the car sinks deeper into the water making it harder to get to
and harder to see
So if Mack wants to keep all of the prize money
He really needs to be moving as fast as possible
But as you can see thats not going to be easy
Nolan come here Take it
Mack continued saving bag
After bag after bag
Mack youre crazy
But on top of the fact that the car is sinking deeper and deeper
What Mack hasnt realized yet is that the last two bags of money
are actually seatbelted into the back seat of the car
Dude Mack could be in an action movie honestly
Well he was like a borderline Olympic swimmer earlier in his life
which is why I did this fear
Yeah but its like 40 feet down and the water is freezing cold
How can you hold your breath out?
He got another bag
Well you got 700000 on the boat
Just stop now Just stop now
Just leave it on the bottom of lake
We can do the next  No
All right He doesnt care
At this point
the car was literally at the bottom of this 45 foot deep lake
making it almost impossible for Mack to retrieve the last 100000
Yeah you know I really cannot
Its black down there Theres nothing
Are you officially calling it?
I cant see the car Jimmy Its gone yes
The boats tilting
You are very athletic
Do you like this video better or the other video better?
Dude this video is like 10 times as intense
I know
And even though this looks very crazy theres actually seven
safety divers on standby to make sure Mack didnt die
Your prize is now 700 grand
but from here on out its all or nothing
Mack has to face the three remaining fears
to walk out of this with his 700 grand
This one might be the hardest one  Okay
Is it grosser than spiders?
Just come on in
Inside this room is a metal box
In order to progress
youll need to reach inside the box and pull out whats inside
And before you put your hand in the box
were going to need you to sign this
It just basically says that
you cant sue me if anything in there hurts you
Just sign right there
All right we got it signed
What is it like an animal or something?
There are things in this box
Just step up here
You put your hand in one of these holes
And theres a thing in here you need to pull out
Dude that is freaky as Okay
Im just going to make sure its moving
Stop  Okay go for it
Clearly it has not touched him yet
No matter what once you grab onto it you have to pull it out
What you grabbed
is our brand new Feastable bars
We got all new branding and a better tasting formula
Lets try it together  I am not going to go soft on you
Im going to tell you honestly what I think
Okay thats pretty good
The new formula is milkier creamier
We have our all new crunch flavor the milk chocolate flavor
almond flavor my personal favorite and peanut butter
These new and improved Feastables bars are rolling out now
Give us a couple of days to get them on the shelves
of your local Walmart Target 7Eleven
And I cannot wait to see what you think of them
All right Mack you ready for the next fear?
Jimmy Ive been in this exact same room
and Ive had a bunch of money on the line before
Ill tell you what
If you give me 500 grand right now Ill walk
Do you guys hear this man?
Jimmy  Who asked for 500000?
400 grand?  No
Hear me out
If you said 200 maybe 250 I would have considered it
How about 350?  No
All right lets go
Next challenge
I knew hed break
All right I mightve lied
That one wasnt actually that hard
But this next one is actually based on one of the scariest things
Ive ever done
Theres no way
How about quickly he pieced it together?
Oh no no no no no Theres actually no way
Come on  There is actually no way Jimmy
Is it that obvious what it is?
What gave it away? The tombstone with your name?
For the next challenge we are going to bury you alive for 24 hours
No way dude
And you can get out whatever you want
but you dont know what time it is
And if you leave before the 24 hour mark youll lose everything
Thats a good fear
For once Im on the other side
Yeah bro!
It might get a little cold
Nolan dont mess it up please
Ill try not to
This is from my nightmares man
It feels wrong being on the other side but also fun
What the
Oh this is so freaky
The funny thing is that the timer hasnt even started yet
because you arent fully buried
It feels wrong saying this but can you bury me faster?
As you wish Mack!
Bring in the extra hand
Stop it stop it stop stop stop stop
Lets officially start the timer
Looks like 24 hours just started
and Im already freaked
so this aint going to be good
Mack see that rope above your head? Can you pull it for me real quick?
Is this a trick?  No
Next time you pull that bell we will dig you up
And if it does not say above 24 hours you lose everything
I will burn your house down
And also the 700000
Yeah I was like everything?
Everything Sweet dreams Macketh!
All right dont throw the walkie talkie
Was it that predictable?
I already know they threw it and Im not even up there
Theres so much more fun to be on this side of it
And to make sure Mack doesnt die in his own grave
Hes going to be wearing this wristband
that directly tells us his heart rate and vitals
And no it does not give him any way of knowing what time it is
Basically I need to figure out how to keep track of the time
Heres my strategy
I could try to stay awake for 2 hours sleep
for 10 hours and then I would be halfway done with the challenge
and I could just do that twice and that would be good
With Macks plan now in place
his first step was to pass the time for the next 2 hours
Well its no Feastable bar
but I guess that makes hunger stop
But it was pretty obvious he was quickly getting bored
Dude you got to be honest theres not much going on inside this room
Thats the whole point
And Mack being bored this early
is a pretty telltale sign that he may not be too good at this
because already
within 45 minutes Macks idea of time was horrendously off
I think its been about 2 hours
Im going to try to get about
10 hours of sleep which should put me at the halfway mark
Even though the pro to sleeping is that itll help Mack past time faster
First night sleeping in the coffin
The con is its very difficult for him to keep track
of how long hes been buried especially when hes not even able
to stay asleep for more than 30 minutes at a time
I have no idea what time it is right now
Im a little creeped out
Hopefully for the love of God its been over 12 hours
I think thats where were at
And because
when I did the challenge I was constantly woken up by my friends
Jimmy Jam
I thought Id give Mack the same joyful experience
Wake up Mack Are you okay?
Dude you look like you just got hit by a truck
Kind of feels like I did just get hit by a truck
If I was to legitimately guess how many hours in I am
I think its like
The longer Mack stayed in the coffin
the less he seemed to know what time it was
It might be hour 16
And because we like to build a lot of suspense on this channel
for the remainder of this fear
youre not going to know how long hes been in there either
And even though Mack wanted to ensure
that he was going to be there long enough
it was clear that claustrophobia was getting to him
Being in this coffin is scary
And the longer Im in here the worse I feel
Its a crazy feeling
But eventually when we saw Mack begin to grab that rope
we knew
he was thinking about ringing that bell
Thats the face of somebody thats about to ring this bell soon
Theres no way its been under 24 hours
God Im nervous
Ive been in one of these videos before
And I lost everything
And the only reason I even am back here at all
and got a second chance is actually because of you guys
Me screwing up that second chance all comes down to
if I know for a fact its been 24 hours
I really hope Im not making a mistake right now
Buddy pal how you doing?
Jimmy Im pretty nervous
I dont want to accidentally reveal the time so no comment
Jimmy I dont know how you do this for seven days dude
I do not feel well in here
Have you got to the point where you start
to lose blood flow in your legs
and you feel like your back is going to fall out of your body?
Jimmy Im thinking about pulling this thing
No comment
Jimmy Ill give you 50 bucks back if you tell me what time it is
All right I got a comment for you
Just get a shovel ready all right?
Oh my gosh hes about to do it
This is it
Stop the timer
And now that Mack has made his decision
There was just one last thing I had to do
Do you mind if I tell them about Shopify while we unbury you?
You have got to be kidding
Shopify is a platform that helps entrepreneurs
get started down the path they want
Sometimes starting a business can be scary
like getting covered in spiders or being buried alive
I can tell you you do not want to be buried alive
But Shopify is here to help
If I hadnt started my own business I wouldnt have been able
to go to all the crazy places like Antarctica
and make videos like these for you guys
And just like billions of other people have done with Shopify
You can get started today on your business right now
Mack you want to know how long you were in there?
I have a feeling youre not going to tell me until you dig me up
You are correct
And one of the perks of owning my own business is
I can do fun things like send one of my friends to the Superbowl
Mack Karl and Nolan each have their very own football for sale
and whoevers football sells the most
Im going to give you tickets to the Super Bowl
and Im going to bury the other one alive
All that matters is that you download the Shop app
and vote from one of them by buying either Nolans or Karls football
And now that I can afford this video lets see if Mack loses 700000
Hey Jimmy
There you go!
Welcome to the outside world
Now that you are out of the coffin lets see if you were in there
for 24 hours
If the number I reveal is lower than 24 hours then you lose 700000
36 hours!
That is what I am talking about
He scares me
Congratulations Mack
This means that you are now just one challenge away
from winning all this money
You should probably go shower first
Yeah I smell not great
So far in this video Mack has shown me
It is very difficult to scare him
but the final challenge of this video may just be Macks worst fear ever
And thats because the final challenge of this video
is a 1 to 1 recreation of the challenge he failed on last time
The last challenge
Hold this in front of your face Dont look
Hey Im not looking  Dont look
Im not looking  All right keep your eyes closed
Dont open them
Dont open your eyes
Keep walking Dont open them
All right open them
No no no Im not doing that again
Come over here
No! Jimmy I do not want to do this again
Stand here where the cameras can see you
No!  Okay
The last challenge is the fear of failure
We recreated the set where he lost 800000 in this video
And like last time the rules are extremely simple
There are four stages
Each has its own cookie with a shape on it
You have to cut out all the shapes without breaking a cookie
And if you do break a cookie you lose 700000
And for you specifically
it will have been the second time its happened
I do not want to be here again
Well good Because I have an offer for you
You can quit right now
and walk away with this 300 grand or risk it for the biscuit
And if you finish this final challenge win 700000
This is actually like a very very big decision
Yeah because thats not quite enough is it? Its less than half
But if you lose again that is 15 million lost on this set
Are you sure?
Hes hitting it
Mac I know this is hard
but youre going to have to make a decision here
Do you want to go home with 300000
or do you want to risk it all for this final challenge?
All right fine Im doing it
All right To be honest Im glad I want you to win this whole thing
If you look at this iPad right here
this is exactly how long it took Mack to get through all four stages
last time he did the challenge 34 minutes and 54 seconds
So thats exactly how long Im going to give you again
Dont break the cookie while opening
Even though hes going quick right now
might not be in his best interest
because if he accidentally snaps a cookie he loses
34 minutes
You did it that quick?
Scan scan scan scan
Its green
This is a much different deal than last time
So Im going to take my sweet time cutting the circle out
He is flying through this
Why is it so much harder to open?
Probably because youre like freaking out
You want me to try?
Open it
Okay Hold my iPad
Okay Its very hard to open
What are you guys doing?
I dont want to be responsible for that
Theoretically Macks strategy makes sense
Getting through the easier shapes fast
to save all the time for umbrella which he lost 800000 off
You literally still have 32 minutes left
Yeah Well Im going to need all 32 of those for umbrella
That is borderline impossible
Move out  Im moving
Allow me
Clap clap clap clap clap Lets go
Mack stop breaking my set
Bro you guys got to make these easier to open
Theres just no need to rush Youre literally using no time
I mean you might need to go slower on this one because its a lot trickier
This one is pretty hard not even close umbrella
Trying to get to the race before I start racing
God this is so hard
Well I dont need that anymore
Maybe it didnt break all the way through?
He still had 29 minutes left
He did the first two in 4 minutes
I dont know why I did this
I did that twice?
Give me your hand
No Jimmy please I dont want to leave yet
No Jimmy
Nah dude I dont even know how to feel right now
Right here Come on
I have like so much time
Yeah Im still just not sure why you were going so fast
The umbrella I just know that umbrella takes forever
Mack told me in this video that there was nothing
that I could do to scare him
And after putting him through spiders a sinking car
and more I really did start to believe him
The only thing that ended up getting to Mack
was the fear of his own failure
How is it going Prerna Harsh and Asher?
I have a challenge for all 3 of you okay?
I want you to pick any fast food location of your choice
and spent 24 hours in it without being kicked out
Good luck!
What to do?
Its from Mr Beast and not an ordinary challenge
We are in the McDonalds and I am going to be here for 24 hours
We searched for the biggest and most empty McDonalds
Its highly rated
It has two floors
It was very crowded so we sneaked to the first floor
We are now sitting in the corner
So Harsh we now have to order
And how will we pass the time?
I have thought of ordering the full menu
It will take time for us to eat and they wont rush us out
You have become as cunning as me in my company
And your son will be the most cunning
He is saying that he will eat fries
Go to the floor below and order the full menu
Its 1000 am
Go order fast Hand me your parcel
Dont take him with you
yes Keep it with you
Mr Beasts channel is in Hindi so lets see some videos

Since we have to pass the time lets change seats
Prerna Asher wants to sit in this one  Jumping from here to there
The way he is
I wanna do a trampoline and drive the jeep
Asher lets do this after we are done with the challenge

We have to spend so much time here
Our order is here and I was hungry also
So I am gonna eat so much
The full McDonalds menu is here
Kartik Aaryan meal! When did this start coming?
Asher do you wanna have the Kartik Aryan meal?
He wants to eat Ashers meal
He wants to be popular so that his photo is on it
So I am gonna take an hour to eat all this
Its a big day and we have a lot of time
But I dont know how will I settle Asher
Because he has to play around

So we will do the changing here
I waiting for Harsh to come here Here he is!
He is here with all preparation
Asher this is your bed

Sometimes he feels hot and cold
It was so easy on the bed
Should we go home?
You ate the meal it was the challenge
Give him the lipstick  No He has already broken one
Is that so?  Yes
Harsh!  Yes
What happened?  You said you got a full meal?

Asher is looking at the rides outside
Can I take him outside for the rides?
Its Ashers first challenge that too by Mr Beast
He called out his name
Harshi and Asher
Its Mr Beasts challenge and we have to complete it
Guys I am jumping from one seat to another
We have changed so many seats and spent so much time here
it seems like its my second home
But I am very tired and I dont know what to do
I am thinking of getting a nap right here
There is no other option
You can handle Asher?
Definitely You go to sleep
Its been evening from the morning
We are tired of watching this view
The staff is also bored of seeing us here
Asher is feeling sleepy and hungry
Its milk time for Asher
I found a baby chair
Lets give Asher milk in this chair
And here is my coffee
Where is the coffee?
See what I got?  I already saw it and thought of making him sit in that
Where?  Anywhere!
its our home now Anywhere!
Your coffee Where is his milk?
Thats what I am making!  Wow Prerna
Its almost evening
Eat play and be happy
Its the best spot
Its all empty
This is your milk
Make it in a good quantity
I will make it so much
Here have the milk
As you can see Mr Beast how good Asher is doing the challenge
He is the best challenger in the world
Guys spam Asher OG challenger in the comments
Now Prerna has started dancing with Asher
To make him asleep
First Asher will sleep then I will
We will sleep and then it will soon be dark
And we will hide and thats how we will complete our challenge
They will kick us out
Lets keep ordering
get me an ice cream
It feels like heaven in the lap of Dad
I have to sleep sleep sleep
Harsh how to pass the time?
its been evening from day and I thought to touch up a little
Its more red
Harsh is still walking with Asher
Arent you tired?  Very
Thank You!  Thank You
He didnt seem happy to me
We are bothering him with orders
This is my fourth coffee
To accompany me Harsh has ordered hot chocolate
This is already my fourth coffee
I ordered only because of the cookie
Its the best chocolate
And it was a good cookie so I ordered coffee 4times
I have had four cookies
They have been pissed off a little by us
They werent coming for the coffee I ordered 30 minutes ago
They said we should take out the order by ourselves
I was eavesdropping
The kid behind us is also named Asher
You only do this dont you?
I have to pass the time  What else to do?
She gets super attentive while she is sitting somewhere
The lights are turned on outside
Its evening now
I feel sleepy
I am trying again and finally he is drinking the milk
Lets order him a hot chocolate
He is not of age
Its like a house now
He is again taking him to walk around
While exploring the M McDonalds menu
We found a goggle for Asher
Its a little big for his face
These were the only ones in the kids section
I am not interested  Try it on once
You will see double momies and daddies
He wants to eat that too
no I  am not giving it to you
Play with this
He likes McD
Just we couldnt
He is slapping me
He wants to ride in the car
Its a challenge  He wants to go to trampoline
He wants to go with them
He got bored here
Your fries are here
Count them
Its a happy meal
He cried seeing the happy meal
Now I am going to tell you  whats in a happy meal
We have a Kartik Aryan burger fries coke and its a book inside the Pokemon Pikachus box
And pineapple juice
What happened? Your neck got stuck?
Lets go home
He got me upset He is slapping me
Now I am going to count how many fries  are there in small medium and large
First lets start with small
1920I wont be able to fill them back in 2122
41  Small has 41 fries
Now medium
Guess how many would be in this?
I guess 70  Dont confuse me
67 fries
I guessed 70
I was close
NOw large  First guess
Around 60 Medium is similar to large
It would be a fraud then
We will get to know soon  I am guessing 85
I feel it has the least fries
large fries are a myth
Never order large fries from now on
Medium is good enough
I will say order small
They robbed us I used to think how  many would be there in large
He comes for cleaning again and again
He is very helpful
Lets give him a meal
Call him over
It was good until we hadnt calculated
Its a shock  Medium and large are the same
I was getting bored so we will now do a Happy Meal challenge
We will do an epic Happy Meal challenge
This is the fastest eating challenge
Lets see who finishes the happy meal between me and Dhruv
Jump right in
Dont eat in such a bad way
Dhruv you couldnt even eat it
Come on do it one bite
Go for a single bite
I would eat fires
Look at how badly they are eating
I think he will win
My fries are finished  Finished?
So fast!
There are no tomatoes
You are behind
Dont you want to win?
Dhruv has lost
In how many bites are you gonna finish it?
3 bites
Lets ee
The end
He hasnt even finished the fries  he is way behind
No the Pepsi
Dhruv lost and harshly ate the meal in 20 seconds
The world is moving but she isnt
Because Asher is asleep and now  I have to keep sitting like this
Asher liked McD
They have got very comfortable here
We have to be here so we had to make it comfortable
They have been standing right  here for the last 15 minutes
What are you looking at?
Asher is looking at the car and trampoline
He wants to go there He is stuck here
He is saying he can do it tomorrow
Today he feels good here
We want to go there he is getting sad
We will go after the challenge
We will circle back here   No the challenge will end
It wont  It will
So Harsh and Asher left
I thought of taking him on this car ride
He is enjoying it so much Should I leave Asher?
He isnt seeing me Look up your mother is doing the challenge
He isnt sitting but standing
After spending the day the evening the night in the McDonalds
Harsh and Asher got soft over a car A battery car
We got Asher to the trampoline
Asher go fetch the ball once
Come back after getting the ball
We are waiting for Prerna
When she will be content?
Otherwise we will wait here but not go up
Its the McDonalds where we are doing our challenge
Prerna is sitting up there somewhere
Do you wanna order anything last?  Last means?
Its gonna close at 11 PM  Isnt this 247?
No Its not 247  Cant I stay here?
You can stay here but you would have to do the dishes
Just give me 5 minutes to think
Is this gonna close?
Do you want to eat anything?
What? I mean I thought it was 247
It closes at 11 PM
What to do now? Should I try to hide?
Will I fit here?
Wont someone catch me here?
What are you doing mam?
I was trying to hide in here
Okay I am going

bouncy upbeat music
Jimmy 1000 for the next person to step out
I dont care who
None of you guys want 1000?
Dustin you could have a grand and be done
Thats fine cause last time I checked
five is more than a one
Jimmy Go ahead and send them off
but let this thought marinate in your head
Jimmy 1000 boys
Final offer 2000 if anyone steps out
Dustin groaning
Heres the deal though if one of you left
you would have more leg room
and you actually might be able to last longer
instead of being scrunched up
Dustin All right Im doing it
Jake Are you going?
Are you doing it?
Hes doing it
Doing it  Luke Hes doing it
Jimmy 2000 step out right now
You getting out?
Chandler Welcome  Jimmy All right

Tareq laughing
Just we got an Xbox now
Jimmy So I heard you guys have a deal
We want to trade Marcus for Jake
Marcus gets out Jake gets out
Jimmy Ill let him know your negotiation
They offered Marcus for Jake
Jimmy Jake said no
He said screw your offer

Garrett Im not Dwight
You are Dwight
Whoa Chris what are you doing?

Contestant Not this time
Tareq Chris whats going on?

In a row
Jimmy Wait really?
hands clapping  Jimmy Whoa
Is this the new Chandler?
Yeah shrieks
explosion booms
Mr Beast oh
These tanks are literally about to rain missiles on this 500000
And any money that doesnt get destroyed Im giving to Blake
But lucky for you Im going to give you my credit card
And you can spend as much money
as you want
trying to protect this money from all of the missiles
were going to be firing at your money
So I just build whatever I want?  Whatever you want
But you only have 24 hours before we fire the tanks
I need metal! Lets go!
Alright lets go boys! Hes running!
Were kicking this off with a sprint
All right Blake where are we heading to first?
Im thinking the Junkyard  Blakes first 3 hours
consisted of sourcing any metal he could find to protect his money
I mean this looks like they have metal even if that meant spending 30000
Definitely want that Want that All the trucks
Basically you just want every car here  Yeah
Can you give me any of your shipping containers?
Lets go out back!
Yeah This is good
Those would work well if I put them on top of the money
And is if buying out the entire store wasnt enough
Blake did the same thing at two other industrial stores
Well everything I get from you today
I would need within the next 12 hours
12 hours?
Im willing to pay double  Ok well get it
It is very quick to throw my money around
And while we waited for the materials to be delivered
We headed back to the money and Blake laid out his official plan
You just spent the last hour strategizing
What did you come up with to stop the tanks
from destroying your money?
Step one I want to put a shipping container over the money
That is actually genius
Step two giant water tanks
Do you think thats your best defense?
I think its good but its not the best
Step three these containers filled with bricks
hay and wood
Step four is my best defense
A fortress of strategically angled cars from the last video that I saw
Those bullets are going to hit those cars and ricochet elsewhere
If he actually builts everything you see here
I will be flabbergasted
Lets get to work  Good luck
Unfortunately for Blake
it wouldnt be for another 4 hours until his materials were delivered
So he hired some construction workers to help get the job done
Im building a complete fortress
If we dropped the atomic bomb on this thing
the moneys not going anywhere
This is like an industrial construction site
It started to look like Blake
might actually have a chance at protecting his money
But even if the 500 grand survives those tanks the tanks
are actually only the first of four phases of attacks
Blake will have to defend
And believe me when I say this theyre going to get much more challenging
For the rest of the night
Blake and his crew worked tirelessly to defend the money
but by the time the sun rose they still werent quite done
Looking good Looking good
Thats the money The tanks are over there
What is this car here for?
This is like my inventory back here dude
Put your inventory between the money and the tank
Give me 10 minutes And that white car will be ready
I mean you have 5 minutes
I dont think I even have time to do anything else
Time is up Stop stop time is up
Drop it Drop it right there
Go far away
Blake time is officially ended
Seems pretty sturdy
Lets go fire some tanks
Ive been up for about 25 hours now
Just building and building and building
I mean Im looking at it now and it looks great
But then I turn around and I see these five beasts
and then I see these shells that theyre working with
I really had no idea theyre going to be that big
You think a shipping container is stopping that?
Hopefully three of them are
All right its time Load up the tanks
These five tanks aimed at your money are about to fire 20 rounds
Blake fire the first shot
Theres so much dust
Oh my Gosh! Look at his face Look at Blakes face
No way his money is safe
So only 19 more right?
19 more to go
Chandler Fire!
This is way too much fun
All the way back here
I can count eight holes in that shipping container
Yeah I see those holes
No shot his money is safe  Id ask you how youre feeling
Well we might as well fire the last few shots
Lets just get this over with
Five shots
Four shots remain
Three shots remain
How much money do you have back there?
Like half a
Two remain
And of course Blake you have to fire the last shell
The honor is mine
After this well see if you have any money left
Oh hes running Hes so fast
Is there any money?
Wait its still there!
Blake it looked like your money survived
We got a fresh stack
I know youre happy
Were moving on to phase two of four and in 24 hours were going to blow up
the biggest bomb weve ever blown up in our history of the channel
around this money
Are you going to drop it or are you going to shoot it?
Im glad you asked Ill be right back
Blake what do you think is in those green crates?
I dont know dude it looks like
Here Ill answer for you
This is a hundred crates filled to the brim with TNT
How are you even allowed to do that?
Im not sure its legal
And while we prepared one of the biggest explosions
in YouTube history
Blake began to strategize on how to keep his money safe
Step one we got to take everything flammable out of here man
All the wood has got to go
Step two water tanks
Step three
I want to move the shipping containers that I got
I just want to close them in into the other shipping containers
Then step four is just walls cement bricks cars if I have to
Explosion is a lot worse than the tanks
This is bigger than that safe that blew up?
Every single thing inside that destroyed
The first time he lost 250000 in this video
Are we going to repeat it?
And because at this point Blake had been awake for over 24 hours
he trusted the construction workers
to finish the job while he got a good nights rest
Yeah Im going to bed Good night guys This is Blake going dark
And because he was so exhausted
Blake slept for way longer than he planned
All right I got a good nights sleep
About to find out how much progress was really done overnight
Like half
That means nothing has happened since Ive been gone
And with only 6 hours remaining Blake did what he could by covering
his weak spots with spare parts bricks and more cars
Looking good in here looking real good
Oh Mr Jimmy  What am I about to witness?
If you listen closely you can hear beeping
Its actually a school bus coming in
Its going to be plopped right where youre standing
I assume its not full of children
Its a short bus
That is just not what I asked
Is our brand new feastable bar new flavor new branding
You want to try it Blake?  Yeah
Im using our snack products
to distract them from telling them where to put the bus
Dude honestly this is better than all the other ones
All the other ones  I promise
Anyone want a piece of chocolate?
Did you get that?
Hey Blake!
5 minutes till boom
I need 10 more minutes Just give me five extra minutes
You have four minutes
Bro you spraying them with water  Probably feels good
I dont think they agree
Theyre literally getting off the car
Theyve got 90 seconds left
Blake youre running out of time
Go! Go!
Hey! Its five oclock
Stop stop stop turn it off turn it off
Hey hey Blake Turn it off
before I start taking your money
Lets go over to the bunker
You narrowly escaped death from the tanks
Lets see if you can do it again
Let the sun go down so its a little darker now
This is the biggest bomb weve ever set off
This is the first bomb Ive ever seen
Blake are you nervous?
Yeah Im sweating now
This is the detonation device Here you go
Its live?
Yes its live
Two days of work 17 cars six water jugs
for shipping containers and 500000 on the line
Lets find out if youre going to be rich or go home with nothing
When youre ready Blake
two one
Mom I love you
That firestorm is massive
Can we go put that out?  Before we go put it out
Im just wasting time
Grab the fire extinguisher!
Lets go see if it burns!
Oh its on fire over there
Be careful of this
Get off my money
The fire still going on up front
Blake is moving sandbags
Right there should be good
Please dont be ashes
What do you see? What do you see?
I see green!  Oh my gosh
Yeah baby! Yeah!
I see a lot of dirt on it but it seems it survived
I knew it
Blake youve officially completed phase two of four
Do you want to see what the next challenge is?
All right Blake for your third challenge
were going to be dropping flaming cars filled with gasoline
on top of your money
Can you tell me how many cars?
A lot  A lot?
A lot
This is going to be the hardest phase yet
Not only will Blake have to deflect the attack from the sky
but hell also have to protect his money from the flammable gasoline
seeping through the cracks of his defense
And after we drop the cars I have another surprise
Good luck
I want the crate with the money in it to be stuffed with concrete
that shipping container thats just sitting
Plop that on top of the money
Since Blake had been working
so hard for the past few days he ended up going right to sleep
and saved most of his work the next day
And although he seemed confident this challenge
would soon prove itself to be more difficult
than anything hes ever faced in these videos
Lets go Blake!  Come on Blake!
Alright this is day four
Im feeling like a zombie
Were going to take the other shipping container that I have
Were going to pick that up and were going to put it
in a formation to where the point is facing up so its like a pyramid
The cars will hit it doom and fall but not on the money
Weve got to get that shipping container on top as soon as possible
Its starting to worry me a little bit
Over the next few hours
Blake did everything in his power
to place the top shipping container at an angle to deflect the cars
even if that meant using wooden logs to prop it up
If this container does not go exactly where I want to right now
Im probably losing a lot of money
We did it
Oh that makes me feel really good
The water tank we bring that over to
like right here fill that thing with bricks
and then were going to take the last car we got
Put it right here
Thats going to block all this is going to look great
We got a plan baby
But what Blake didnt know is I was about to introduce a twist
Do you want to know what the twist is?
Yeah  Follow me
See that flag over there? Thats a catapult
So as cars fall from the top giant flaming balls
are going to be hurled from the side
Dude Ive been guessing millions of things I never thought catapult
I have like no more materials I have nothing else to use
Throughout the final hour Blake raced to cover the weak spots
of his fortress
However there was still a key part missing
His water truck
which he sent to refill in the morning was painfully late
He has 90 seconds left
Alright here we go
As always it comes down to the wire with Blake
60 59 58
54 Hes drenching everything in water
before he drop the car to try to protect the money from the fire
30 seconds remain
You really think this is going to stop the fire?
Oh yeah baby
Three two one Drop it
Just for that
Im not showing mercy on the last one
You knew that was going to happen dude  That was intentional
Oh man moment of truth
Look how high up that bad boy is
This is only the first of five flaming cars
Were going to be dropping
On top of the five flaming death balls from the catapult
You ready? Blake?  Get this going dude
Now drop it
Hold on
Everything is actually setting on fire right now
The burning car successfully rolled off the container
However the wood that Blake used to prop it up
quickly engulfed in flames
Dude whats going on?
What is happening?
What in there is on fire Blake?
I dont
I dont even know what to say
What was on top of the shipping container?
All right there is wood there
Lets not jinx it
Knock on wood
You put wood?
And you knew we are dropping flaming cars?
I needed to use them dude
Luckily Blake
did surround his money with cinderblocks
so theres still a very high likelihood his money is unburned
And since were about to go into the coolest part of this video
obviously now Im going to tell you about ACORNS
Their debit card is meant to help
you grow your money not just spend it
which Ill tell you more about in a second fire!
ACORNS just launched the new Mighty Oak debit card
They made with Dwayne Johnson
Cool thing about this debit card is every time
you make a purchase
it automatically rounds up
to the nearest dollar and invest the difference for you
Believe it or not your money is also under attack not by flaming
death balls but by things like bills spending and inflation
Which is why when youre not spending
your money youll be hard at work
in two of the highest APYs available
Chandler what does APYs mean?
It means you can fight back against bills and inflation
by growing your money  just by having it in your account
Blake how are you doing buddy?
Im remembering what it feels like to lose one of these things
Oh its a direct hit
Right on the money
Just from signing up ACORNS and I are giving you 20
to start growing your money
So go to acornscommrbeast
To learn about how you can make your money work for you
The rain of fire continued all throughout the night
Oh oh
And as the flames only grew bigger things started to look really
bleak for Blakes money
That fire was raging for over an hour and a half
Its either all going to be there or its not going to be there at all
That right there is a bunch of logs of wood
He accidentally created a giant bonfire
He thought he was making a fortress
but he was actually making a furnace
I mean theres still a chance the concrete protected the money
Blake moment of truth Did your cinderblocks
protect your money or was the fire just too much?
Oh Oh
Those are ruined
Wait hold up The money is fried
Its a thousand degrees in there
Lets be real with ourselves Blake
Its gone
As you saw most of the money looks like this
Another loss
Yeah This one hurts more than the laser one
What hurts the most is that I worked so hard for nothing
Yeah it sucks
The challenge is officially over
And before you go Blake I have an offer for you
You have two choices
You can either walk away with 100000 or you could get a third
and final chance to compete in a future video
All right Im coming back  Youre coming back?
Im coming back
Blakes last chance to win
a video is going to be right here but it wont be out until February
I dont think me the audience
Everyone can bear to see you lose a third time
Ill see you then
This is a video of the best workers on the planet
The best
Like this guy who can make a whopper in under one second
or this person who can do the job of a hundred people
Thats crazy we should hire him
All right so we have a bus boy cleaning a table bro
This dudes cleaning at like his lifes on the line
Hes sonic and he is speed
For some reason this reminds me of like
a battle in Naruto
I wanna go there and order a hundred pancakes
but each on a different plate
So then he has to pick up all of them
I wanna see a God in action
Oh this is the type of stuff I like
This is working smarter not harder
No way is this how you actually do it?
This is how you break things if you want to
But this guy got lucky
That is probably the coolest thing Ive ever seen
I wonder if it costs less to hire him
because he doesnt need a real truck
It probably calls more to insure him
because theres a good chance hes gonna break something
Bro is moving
Oh my goodness
Oh its firefighter truck
Oh snap
We assume hes a firefighter
He could just be a guy who really likes climbing ladders
This is the fastest Whopper ever made
Ill be the judge of that
Actually that person with the clock
will be the judge of that
Look at him his positioning his face
That is intense focus
Were about to witness history
Oh ketchup fell over part of his plan
See now its ready
Oh my God it was ready for the squirt
I would say Im impressed but Burger King sucks
Go order Beast Burger its 30 times better
Burger Kings do Beast Burger better
Oh thats sick
Hes just popping off
If I saw that I would just walk up to him
and give him a 50 bill
Yeah I have a strong urge to give him tons of money
I wonder whats gonna happen
Oh wait thats not what I thought would happen
I thought they were about to pop off
This man knows physics geometry and math
Hes unstoppable
You know whats more impressive
than that guy whos clearly forklift certified?
This rectangular ice cream cone
Circular ice cream cone
This ice cream goes up to the edges when it melts
it drips down the side
Its sticky and it sucks
This one it drips into the box
Yeah its like a bathtub  It is
Its like an ice cream cone bathtub
Oh my God this is genius
Whoa its still going
Look at that
And he made a sword with it
This guys smart
Ive always thought about doing this
but Ive never done it
Until he falls
I like the music
It makes it feel like Im watching a Disney princess
Making a fence
They make it with sand
Thats so genius
Cause then they can just pour
Thats Minecraft
But real life  Thats cool
This is the worlds best cucumber chopper
Ive already sliced my hands a thousand times
if this was me
Wow  Thats paper thin
Heres the problem
Cucumbers tastes horrible
Oh when the clip said a bunch of men
pounding on the title card I thought something else
This is cool
More importantly wheres that spike going?
Are they like literally nailing the parking lot
to the earth?
I know what theyre doing
Theyre building experiences together
Window cleaning contests
I wouldnt believe if its real
if there wasnt a giant banner in the background
Youre not telling me youre not a big fan
of the International Window Cleaning Association
Its just a bunch of old dads
This guys good though
Martys killing it
Cleaning up dishes
Hes making a flower
Somebodys dad
I strive to be that annoying of a dad
Thats impressive
Thats someone who loves their job
TikTok ker Got something new for yall

Im going to call the mega multiverse combo
Oh I did not know where that was
Oh my God that is insane

You will forever wonder and never get the answer
Good luck sleeping tonight
I did this as a kid with my four wheeler
I lived in the country

We didnt have these fancy gokarts
Thats pretty innovative
Fun fact I heard that gokart
Speeding past my house at 300 AM last night
and I looked out and Carl was doing donuts in my front yard
Bro why dont I get invited to the adventures?
I guess you just gotta be there when Carl has his
300 AM adventures
He said physics pause for one second
I gotta look cool
Okay it touched his finger on the last one
Did anybody see it pour down his finger
and go into the drink
Oh wow Im still taking the shot
Of great juice shot of great juice
I mean I could trim a bush like this I feel like

Show me a penguin or a giraffe
Oh he missed a spot  He missed a spot
He missed his spot  Hes about to hit that spot
Hit the spot  Hit that spot right there

He can have whatever he wants
He can have the house
My dog
The yard
Wait whats going on here?
Drift acholic
Yeah this guys good at parking
This is the most British thing Ive ever seen
a man getting excited about parallel parking
Theyre playing Minecraft IRL
put the Minecraft music over it
and then when he puts it in the wheelbarrow
make the chest sound
Thats funny now
Lighting a lighter with an excavator
What?  How did he do that?
That is so cool
Why did he have to use seven phones as a table?
Couldnt he use like a rock or something?
He just borrowed everyones like Hey everyone
gimme your phones
Give me your phones
I need them they might break
This guy needed a trim bad
giving a good shear call him Ed Shearing
Thats not the same person
Theres no way thats the same person
Hold on It is!
He made that guy look like a completely different person
with that haircut
Wow thats wild
They say the hair makes the man
Wait what happens here?
Hes destroying the  The ceiling hes on
But hes on a crane
Hes like Im free
Its Jason Bourne
I feel like I can do that
Delivering your food on time
I want to go here right now
Hey bro
Its the hundred pancakes I ordered earlier
Theyre finally here
One for a bowl
I didnt even know this was here
Lets go with the call back of a century
Whatever this restaurant is bring that guy in
He can clean it up quick
Im leaving whatever this job can be considered
to go be a rollerskate  You dont work here
Yeah youre right
They just keep unlocking the door and let me back in
I give him free food
Thats gotta be in Japan
And why do we live in America man?
Look they got it figured out
But is she drawing?
Is she better with her feet or with her hand?
Shes doing them all at the same time
The ones with her hand are so photorealistic
Theres no way this is real
I I refuse to believe it
If this is real it is factually
the coolest thing Ive ever seen
and Ive said that many times in this video
Zoom in on the bottom right one
She drew that with her foot
while drawing with her other foot
You have no talent compared to her
I youre right
Neither do I
This looks like a really good way
for a customer to be like
all right Im walking out and then just bang tire
Using a water shield
Oh thats cool
Oh it was like a propane tank that was on fire
So he is using the water to shield the fire
so he can turn it off
Where do you where did he get that fire from?
I dont know where the fire came from
He is Prince Zuko
Refueling an RC car
Oh this is one of those cars that runs
off of like pure alcohol
Thats why theyre so fast
Look at that thing
Remind you when we tried to push a car with RC cars
Oh my god  Oh my God
Wait is that really how they film?
Wow he is really good at that
He might just put Tariq out of a job
So the wasps were just like standing there
Its like the wasps are paid actors
Well I think the wasp for like God wouldnt intervene
between the fights of wasp and bees and then Gods like
Makes sense
Funny pan sound
Is it the spin and drummer guy?
Go drum guy
Would you say hes the best drummer in the world?
I would say hes probably the dizziest drummer
Thank you so much for watching
I hope you enjoyed it
If you havent already subscribed
Please  Right now
today im gonna be reacting to videos i
couldnt upload to this channel like one
time we rammed a car going 100 miles per
hour into a wall
another video that never got uploaded
was a video where we built a city out of
bouncy castles it was insane we also
tried to lay the worlds longest domino
chain we visited the seven wonders of
the world and much more me and the boys
are gonna react to them and just you
know tell you what went wrong which
video do you want to react to first
chandler 100 mile an hour car versus
wall thats a good one theres no story
in this at all we just duct taped a
bowling ball into a car and then just
slammed into trying
wait wait chris you want to see your
strike in slowmo i do why youre so
and in case youre wondering yes this
was filmed on a closed course with
professional supervision obviously dont
try this at home this was fun
what look how far it goes i dont even
remember filming them
oh yeah because we could edit the green
screen we thought itd be funny to hit a
green screen oh wow we hit a shark oh no
were getting eaten by a shark oh no we
get more who puts that there oh wait i
already know chris is gonna freak out
chris loves this one so chris what
happened here you got a bread on this
card you got a bread on this car they
hit boom sandwich
look at that it actually worked kind of
that counts sort of worked instead of
having your parents make you sandwiches
just grab two cars and ram them together
and thats how you can make it use your
parents cars and also take their credit
card now after all that chaos it finally
came to the time when we rammed this car
100 miles an hour into a wall you threw
a brick on the gas pedal and there she
goes no ones in the car
shes going shes climbing
and there you go the buildup of the
entire video to a blurry camera shot and
right when i saw that camera shot thats
when i went were just gonna delete that
and thats 100 mile an hour car versus
wall but not all videos get scrapped
because theyre story lines some videos
they just fall apart literally heres
security camera footage of our warehouse
that right there is a giant pit of glue
and we were gonna do last leave glue
wins a bunch of money but the glue pick
couldnt hold it and it literally just
bust open which is kind of ironic
because you would think thousands of
pounds of glue would stick together that
literally took weeks to clean up it
wasnt fun the next video that didnt
get uploaded is visiting the seven
wonders of the world what i did is i
surprised all my friends with vacations
to a random wonder of the world you went
to the pyramids of egypt yeah and you
went to stonehenge
yeah that was terrible garrett went to
machu picchu and were here why i dont
know jamie
marcus went to the grand canyon
and so on oh wow whoa

the guy your girlfriend tells you not to
worry about this is you yeah yeah so
lets start off with you chandler this
is you yes at the great pyramid we are
at the great pyramids this is our tour
guide with the umbrella hat how were the
pyramids they were

so fun heres ty at niagara falls i
think he was trying to act like a news
reporter its been a while since i
looked at this footage
all right wheres chris if youre
wondering where chris is its because he
went to stonehenge and theres nothing
to do there look theres rocks behind us
literally just rocks and its a wonder
of the world and its a wonder i wonder
why its a woman thats why its a
wonder the world wonder i went to was
the roman coliseum but when i was flying
there i accidentally left my camera on
the plane and i could not find a camera
store in freaking italy im gonna hit
you guys with the sigh
this video cost around 90 000 between
all the plane tickets the hotels the
food all that stuff 90 grand and because
i left my camera on a plane and i called
the airlines they couldnt find it i
didnt have my footage and we couldnt
upload it and the next video we scrapped
is dominoes we tried to film this domino
video four times and all four times it
didnt work let me run you through it
the first time we filmed this video i
got all the boys in a room and i told
them whoever made the coolest domino
contraption won money but the problem is
they all suck at laying dominoes and it
wasnt that cool so i gave them three
days to build stuff and all they could
build was the eyes of a creeper whatever
that was seven thousand dominoes that
took a long time yeah you guys had three
days what is this so then the next week
we tried to lay the worlds longest
domino chain this is us laying dominoes
and we were dead set on trying to lay
the longest domino chain ever the wind
kept knocking it down so we ended up
laying them on their sides it sounds
good on paper breaking the worlds
longest domino chain but what we quickly
realized is its boring as crap to watch
people lay dominoes for 15 minutes all
these scrap videos are from months ago
obviously none of these are recent what
is this video i dont know heres a shot
of the line after a very long day this
is all the dominoes look at that thats
a big boy we were dedicated and chandler
did keep knocking it over but you know
we kept going every time and by chandler
i mean me huh i wonder why this video
didnt get uploaded were getting bored
watching it yeah i know for some reason
we thought wed be able to lay a domino
chain on the side of a road and break
the world record that way but no once we
realized that we just decided to knock
them all over because why not and uh
yeah this is the the chain that
didnt work
now it doesnt
this is the chain this is not as hype as
i thought it was gonna be this is not a
slope this is so boring i mean you can
clearly see why we scrapped this video
the domino chain might have seemed a
little lame but we had a cool surprise
at the end we literally laid all this
domino artwork at the end as like a
finale of the video look at that youtube
button that isnt good forever
thats very satisfying thats really
satisfying oh
none of what we laid work we have to
constantly go in and knock more dominoes
over it was a disaster okay were not
good at laying dominoes you know how
much those dominoes cost how much i
think like 70 grand good thing i didnt
pay for it
social distancing the next video i
scrapped is a video where i wanted to
give a couple dogs the best month of
their life what i did was i got a barn
and i renovated it to look like a doggy
wonderland i even built a giant fence
out back i got the dogs unlimited food
unlimited toys literally anything they
could ever want but the problem is in
america when youre housing a bunch of
dogs theres a ton of laws and
apparently you just cant do it so yeah
i spent like 60 70 000 on this barn and
all this other stuff and then um when it
came to filming i realized oh im not
allowed to do this im not allowed to
just get a bunch of dogs and treat him
like king apparently you have to have
licenses and stuff to house a bunch of
dogs so we had to get it up next is a
video where we tried to break a bunch of
world records
the gist of it was me and the boys were
gonna try to break like 100 world
records and shocker its a lot harder
than we thought so these are some of the
ones we did and we even called on cam
newton hes a nfl quarterback to help us
break some football world records
with 31 yards you are officially amazing
thank you dad
that was the longest throw through a
tire 31 yards yeah no like road through
a tire thats amazing gotta
three on you on youtube
chandler broke the world record for the
longest blindfolded catch believe it or
not this is actually a legit world
record like guinness was there and that
is the longest blindfolded catch ever
guinness world record title you all are
still officially amazing thank you hey
you and cam newton broke a world record
yes we did and i want to say thank you
to cam for giving me this record
didnt you break another one with them
oh yes this one right here was held by
a lot of nfl players the most onehanded
catches in a minute was 30 and then you
and cam did 32 51 wow
with 51 catches
i would not have been able to do it
put my quarterback man
and the final world record we try to
beat is the highest football catch ever
i got in a helicopter 600 feet in the
air and i was dropping footballs as you
see here it was hitting the stadium and
we kept missing and we actually ended up
running out of time so we didnt get
that world record but that one would
have been sick yeah and the next one we
scrapped was i built a city out of
bouncy castles for whatever reason we
thought itd be a good idea to rent
dozens of bouncy castles and then bring
all these people in and have a city this
drone shot youre looking at right now
we literally built this city out of
bouncy castles okay so heres how the
video started we pull up to the city
right here out of bounty castle
everything here is bouncing related and
our citizens are very bounce happy
brother bobby boulevard thats a call
back right there look at this tree with
the tags
this is the most embarrassing video
weve ever filmed in our life but who
put that there the cringe hasnt even
started yet area each one is complete
with a po box and all of our lawnmowers
blow bubbles
all of our lawnmowers blow bubbles this
guy was apparently the town fruit dealer
and he was charging us a hundred dollars
for plastic 100 quality so how much is
that a hundred dollars thats how you
know its right
how is it
dude the middle of that thing hurt it
was solid i thought that was dude i got
like five concussions in this video oh
thats where i get great i also told him
the technique
taylor the entire video is going to
people and saying tackle chris he was
the good part for some reason we had a
threeway banana duel it was a standoff
we were like whats going on this is
just a fraction of the city we built
its a fraction of the cringe yes better
way to phrase it all right now bounce
city had a bounce obstacle course
i did great look at this look look at
kill look at marcus
and at this part chris had a pair of
scissors which this is a city made out
of inflatable bouncy castles right you
pop it theyre done for it so then he
started popping things and then so then
we started running away and everyone
chased us because we had scissors dont
worry i threw the scissors before i
started running
we got chase out of the town because we
had a pair of scissors and thats
against the rules and thats i built the
city out of bouncy castles that was a an
emotional roller coaster to say the
least i was hoping that would never see
the light of day but it just did youre
welcome this is my corner of pain and
the final video im going to show you
guys today is this dinosaur video
basically me and the boys rated a mall
with dinosaurs and you guys liked it so
we did it again with even more dinosaurs
and you guys like that so my logic was
lets just do it again with even more
dinosaurs so we bought 1 000 dinosaur
costumes and got hundreds of people to
gather on a day again this was months
ago before all this stuff currently
going on and we gave them all dinosaur
costumes and began to raid places the
reason this didnt work out is i ended
up getting sick and i had to leave
halfway through i hate when i get sick
sick jimmy not good jimmy but regardless
of that the video is still really
freaking funny wow look at all these
dinosaurs i still cant believe we had
all these people come out shout out to
everyone who uh put on the dinosaur
costume i love you guys it was also very
hot that day and of course after playing
around in the field the first place we
had to raid was a gym but not just any
gym a trampoline
all those dinosaurs
wipeouts the idea for this video was if
we just had hundreds of people in
dinosaur costumes we could just go into
stores and itd be hilarious the gym was
cool but my favorite part is when we
raided the movie theater so here you go
we took hundreds of people in dinosaur
costume to a movie theater we bought
every ticket to every seat in this room
so we could get this shot wasnt that
pretty expensive it was and here it is
thats so funny
wait do we forget to buy two tickets are
they on a date in there then people are
having a date in the middle of our
this is a asteroid hitting the earth and
obviously this is going to anger the
dinos that would make me angry its
giving them flashbacks and they all went
crazy we thought this would be so funny
out of anger we then raided them all
we were forced to watch the earth be
destroyed again everybody was loving it
though at the mall it made everybodys
day at least yeah except for probably
the mall owner was like what in
tarnation thats what he said actually i
heard it when i felt better i wanted to
redo it and i was like so how many
costumes do we have and when they were
like oh theyre all gone everyone just
took them home and i was like
boy and you get the gist of this video
we scrapped tons of videos in the past
if you add them all up these videos that
i never uploaded probably cost over 400
000 film but i care about you guys and i
dont want to upload garbage and if the
video isnt good i dont upload it and
money aside these videos actually took
forever to make like this bouncy castle
video we spent weeks on the seven
wonders of the world we spent over six
days flying the dominos video we tried
to film four times the 100 mile an hour
car video we spent almost a week
prepping for in a few days filming like
this is like a months worth of work too
that just never saw the light of day
like when i say i only want to upload
good videos like i genuinely mean it i
dont care if we spend a month on a
video if we spent over a hundred
thousand dollars like if its not
entertaining and i dont think you guys
will like it i will put it in this png
of a dumpster i will make ice age baby
eat it i dont know why these are on my
wall so do me a favor and subscribe
because i promise whatevers in your sub
box will be at least kinda sorta good
love you guys see you later
Friends here a boy has come for a walk in the forest then he
sees a poisonous plant in the jungle then here he starts eating it then there is a poisonous plant this boy
has got his hand and cats litter due to which he gets infection in his hand now doctor how to cure it?
I will fix it I will understand with the help of animation video but before that if you
are cute then give this video a like and subscribe the channel and if you are an ass then dont do it
and if you want to write then definitely write Jai Shri Ram in the comment box friends first So the doctor
injects NSIC in the hand and then
cleans the hand thoroughly with iodine liquid Then an incision is made in the hand with a knife and the pus
is taken out in such a way as you can see And then the pus
is cleaned thoroughly with a cloth then the poisonous plant
is taken out from inside the hand in this way then a tank is placed on the hand and the hand is bandaged
so that the person can get some relief both are fine
This is 1 in penny This is 20
This is 100 in pennies
That is 1000 in pennies
This is 2000
This is 10000 in pennies
Give or take like five grand I stopped counting
And this is 20000 in pennies
Wait no its not
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Alright now its 20000
So this is 20000 in pennies
Were gonna take these 20000 worth of pennies
and empty em on the backyard
and Chandlers dad has no idea
so when he gets home
theres gonna be 20000 in pennies laying
across his entire backyard
And then were gonna help him pick up all the pennies
and go buy a car
cause as youre remember in the slime video
he said he needs a car
I bought six cars all for my kids
and Im the only one without a car now
So yeah guys lets spread the pennies across the yard
I cant wait to see his reaction
and I cant wait to buy the car
Alright were officially gonna start covering
your dads yard in pennies
How does that make you feel?
How do you think your dads gonna react?
I dont know honestly
Yeah? Alright
Whoa thats a whole lot of pennies
Flashback to Chandler doin that to Chris
Actually no
We currently have seven people opening up rolls
and we have five more coming
But even once all 15 people arrive
if were all goin super hard
theres no way were even gonna do like 10 of that
by the time Chandlers dad gets home
Or maybe like 20 30
but were not gonna be able to do like majority of that
So me and Chris are gonna test some ways
to crack open these roles
because these are what are taking forever
Its just really time consuming
to bust them and get the pennies out of it
So were gonna try to find a more efficient way
because if we dont figure somethin out
I guess were just gonna have
to lay the rolls out in his backyard which is kinda lame
Itd be so much funnier if it was just the pennies
But I dont know were running out of time
So now were gonna see what happens
if we try to burn off the paper
Cause maybe we can just burn the paper off
this whole mound
Apparently you cant just burn the paper off
for whatever reason it doesnt burn
We got two hours left till his dad gets home
We wanted to cover the entire backyard in pennies
but theyre still wrapped up
What do we do?
Alright were really desperate
were gonna see if this works again
I think its just puttin the fire out
Are you tellin me firefighters should
just use pennies?
It looks like it man
Yeah youre definitely doin stuff there
Oh youre gettin em now
I think I am
How do we unravel all these pennies
before Chandlers dad gets home?
You havin fun?
No just tired  Im breakin em open
Were desperate
What would be good to mash
Ow that hit my  Hit that direction
Garretts first swing  Just straight
Ow my !
Fired it right at it
Yeah I got hit in the eye
How do you think I feel?
Feel like this isnt very effective
Now were gonna test the brick method
cause the golf club method isnt really working
I missed
Those look like the Ten Commandments
So I think at this rate well cover this whole yard
in about a week
Yeah unfortunately we only have
an hour and a half though
Next were gonna test the car method
Alright now lets see How easy are they?
Is that a good way to pop the tire actually?
Dude that tire looks a little more deflated
I got my secret weapon on my side now
Chandler what are you doin?
Almost helping
Remember that time when we threw a baseball bat at the car
and it almost killed Garrett?
Watch out  Oh
If we just had a bunch of pickaxes
this might actually work
Surprising my friends dad
with a lot of trash in his backyard
I wanna surprise your dad
with a bunch of pennies in his backyard
I dont know what to do
I dont either! Were almost outta time
Do we just leave em in the rolls?
Would that make our lives easier?
It would make our lives 1000 easier
But is that what were about?
Weve got that pile that pile
and then a couple in here
Its currently what 300?
We did this when we bought the car with pennies
and we knew this would take forever
But we did it anyway cause were absolute
Mad lads  mad lads
Yeah but how did we know this would take forever
and not realize it would take forever?
Sprinkler  Oh my god
I actually didnt get hit by anything
That all hit me right in the head
I didnt get hit
Put this in slowmo
So weve got a mini army over there bustin up the rolls
but I really dont think
were gonna open up all the rolls in time
His dads gonna be home in an hour what do we do Chris?
Even the greats fail sometimes
You think Michael Jordan hit every single dunk?
Yeah I guess youre right Yeah
I guess you just suck
Just so you guys understand
were tryin to put out multiple
really crazy videos every single week
Our videos are so crazy
that were working on so many different videos
at the same day so we can do at least two videos a week
I really wanna get all the pennies unrolled and laid out
but we just simply didnt have time
Theyre still gonna get the money
Theyre still gonna get the cars
The point Im trying to make is that
were just trying to film so many videos
that sometimes its hard for every video to be perfect
And also his dad gets home in an hour
so no matter what
Even if we didnt have videos
for the next four days  Yeah we gotta be done
within another hour
Stick to the end
so that way you can see the dealerships reaction
to the pennies
and what car Chandler and his dad decide to get
Can you go back to work?
Yeah yeah can you
We werent done
Dad you need MMs to go with them Cheerios
dont you?
Yeah  Whats up boy?
Aw he was ready
for another sandwich bro  He has it
You thought he was
I mean hes home
I guess we cant keep it a surprise anymore lets just
All right yeah come on  Come on
What do you do you think were doing at your house?
Theres 14 people in your backyard right now
what do you think theyre doing?
I thought yall was gonna put that slime thing over
Yeah we did
We did put the slime tank in the backyard
Im not gettin back in that
We just wanted to put it back there for fun
Come look at it Come on
Cant see right now  You cant see the slime tank
until you get closer
What the man?
We were gonna put a bunch of pennies
in your backyard but we couldnt
You did  unroll them in time
So we were gonna take em back
but then you still came back
So now we dont know what to do
So theres a bunch of rolled up pennies in your backyard
I think we could just leave it here
for you right?
We dont have to clean em up anymore
You can take em to the bank for me
We were gonna unroll em all
and cover your entire backyard in pennies but
Apparently it takes a long time
It takes longer than 10 hours
Oh my god  which we didnt know
But you have a lot of pennies now
Oh I getta keep em?
Yeah  Were gonna get a car
With pennies?  With pennies yeah
It wouldve made so much more sense
They have pennies there?  if they were just laid out
This is a dollar
Ill make sure I get at least 1 outta this
5 bucks in a box right?  How many pennies do you
think were in your backyard?
Keep on goin  A little bit warmer
For real?
Yeah  Yeah
Theres 21000 here
We were gonna surprise you with them but
21000 worth of pennies?
Yessir  Yeah
We called the dealership
they said they would just take the pennies
Theyre gonna come get em?
No you load em up
and just go buy cars right now
Whatever you and Chandler want
Yeah Sure
yeah Dude thats awesome man
Hold up  The fact that
Awe Yeah look at that
There we go man
Im gonna have a whip  Alright lets get back

Good boy man  Yeah?
So I bet you didnt know havin a son

Finally paid off  Just have your son
work for a YouTuber
Right Yeah  Hey usually
havin a child is really expensive
You guys should have children
so they can become friends with YouTubers
so you can get cool stuff
Also both of you guys lost the slime video so this is
This is redemption  This was worth it
Dude I cant believe this
I cant believe this boy
How long has it been since youve had a car?
So its been six months
Ive been borrowin Hannahs car
to get to work in the mornin come back home
then take Zachs car to work
Or they drop me off I gotta ride back with Uncle John
Its been a pain in the butt
You picked out your car yet?
Uh uh
You should probably do that
Oh yeah In about 20 minutes were gonna go buy a car
Cool  You kinda gotta pick one
I havent given you a hug yet so
Dude its just crazy
I swear man I dont even know
No I did not expect none of this
Dude I thought I was gettin kicked outta my house
when I pulled up and saw the UHaul
Chris finally got rid of me man
Its good content so we all win
I definitely won
I drank one of your drinks Here you go
Oh yeah Actually

Yeah your root beer
I also ate some of your MMs
You can have your dollar back
Oh thank you
Get me another quarter though
You wanna help us?
Heck no I got a bad back man
Im tryin to recoup
Hes rich
Rich people dont have to pick up their money
Boom  You know what youre right
Im glad this worked out really good
This worked out really good Trust me
For you  Yes it did
Hey whens my pennies
in the backyard video though?
Stay tuned  Stay tuned
Its comin up
So Ill give you guys a little behind the scenes peek
of one of our videos
This is usually the amount of people it takes
to do these videos
15 if you include me 16 of you include Chandlers dad
Just movin pennies
Some of our videos literally require an entire army
We can do it on our own
but if we wanna upload two to three videos a week
theres just no way
Cause this would literally take us about two weeks
if we did it ourselves
So we just finished picking up all the pennies
and we put em in all of these boxes
As youll see these boxes are full of pennies
Were gonna take all these boxes to the dealership
and hopefully they give us a car
We just got done surprising Chandlers dad with the pennies
And now were gonna go to the dealership
and buy him and Chandler whatever they want
So lets talk strategy
You guys could buy two 10000 cars
you could buy one 20000 car
you could put 20000 down on a car 10000 on two cars
or you could just spend it all on groceries
Whats the game plan?
Im gonna spend 10000 on a down payment
Okay so youre gonna put 10 grand on down payment
So what are you gonna do with the other 10 grand?
Im gonna try to get a car for 10 grand
Alright Thats the game plan
He wants to put 10 grand down on a car
He wants to buy a car for 10 grand
Lets go see if we can make it happen
Hopefully they take the pennies
So when I got home from work today
and even after I saw all those pennies in the yard
Yeah?  Im like
yeah it was a mess in my yard
Im like oh we actually get to keep these pennies?
Well when I told Chandler I was gonna prank you
Chandler was like Okay
And I was like You get to keep em
Hes like Oh wait what?
Hey Chris
Hey whats up?
Where are you guys goin?
Were going to get Chandler a car
No way me too
Oh Ill see you there
Alright  Hey dont forget me!
Oh Chandlers dad a car

Hey  Thats a good horn
MrBeast oh
If I gave you the choice to either buy 30 Lamborghinis or help save
the lives of 10000 people in one year which would you choose?
We decided to do this
Cue the epic highlight reel of the year
We started this mission in Khayelitsha South Africa
where we found an orphanage that was in desperate
need of our help because it was at risk of being closed down
I started back then I saved more than
5330 children
Those children would be dead
But we keep on opening the doors knowing that maybe someone
will come to our rescue
Like Beast Philanthropy
So we spent the next
six months working tirelessly by rebuilding 12 new homes
with an ongoing supply of fresh food as well as a brand new playground
While the orphanage was being built
we begin our next project
where we gave away 20000 pairs of shoes to kids in Africa
Beast Philanthropy what you have done here at my school
is absolutely amazing
Thank you Mr Beast!
Darren then flew to the Hopi Reservation
in Arizona where he met with Wendy
There are over 10000 members of the Hopi tribe
These people dont have very much but they are
some of the most generous people youll ever meet
The Hopi tribe is situated
hundreds of miles away from the closest quality clothing and food stores
which is bad because the winters here get freezing cold
and they need all the help they can get to stay warm and put food on the table
When we realized just how difficult it was for them to get access to these basic
neccessities we decided to donate over 27 million of clothing
It was amazing
Our kids our people are just so happy
Thank you MrBeast
We then found out that there is an abnormally high number of amputees
throughout Cambodia
so we partnered with Exceed Worldwide to give away 2000 prosthetic limbs
What weve experienced is that its so much more than a limb
Were giving back people their independence
But most important
I realized that we were giving them back their dignity and their selfesteem
Im so excited
and I really thank you!
Darren and Dan then flew to a remote island in Colombia
where they capsized a boat and fell in a river filled with
While they were there
they built a solar grid
which gave the island electricity and WiFi for the first time
which will give the kids on the island the ability to access education online
We also built a bakery to empower the woman in this community which
from day one was a hit
We then travelled to Kenya where fresh drinking water is extremely scarce
I am a father of six children and I want to be the best father of all
Thats why I work so hard to maintain my bread
My bicycle
it has no gears
One of the pedals is not there
the brakes are not 100 working
Sometimes I think if I could take a motorbike engine
and put it on my bicycle
my life would be easier
So with the help of Lectric E Bikes we were able to provide
Mr Barasa and 1000 other people with free electric bicycles
You have made work easier!
Its so easy to ride!
Darren and Dan then travelled to the Cure Childrens Hospital in the Philippines
where we were able to provide 160 kids with life changing surgeries
This little girl has just got her cast off and shes learning to walk
for the first time ever with her straight legs
The magnitude of the surgeries
that these kids are getting from Cure for free will change their lives
And the fact that Beast Philanthropy
can come in here and help Cure provide care to some of these kids
is something thats going to affect me and stay with me for the rest of my life
The construction of the orphanage in South Africa was now complete
and it was time to surprise Mama Rosie and the kids
Mama Rosie also told us about a boy named Yamkela who left the orphanage
14 years ago with the dreams of becoming a musician
However he was struggling to make money and practice his craft
working full time at the airport
It kills me knowing that Im doing something
that Im not into and there is something that
I want to do that I really love but I cannot do it
So we decided to surprise Yamkela with a brand new top of the range
acoustic guitar as well as award him a full scholarship to the best
music school in the country
See you in a year
The team then flew to Thailand
a country with over 2 million stray and disabled dogs
to meet with Michael and help him rescue as many dogs as possible
Where we help thousands of dogs run
for the very first time
As well as give Michael a brand new rescue van
state of the art gas machine and a brand new ambulance
Really happy
Thank you very much
Darren then received this video from a TikToker named Dora moono
Beast Philanthropy
please please help me save our village
our kids need you
So Darren immediately
flew to Doras sanctuary in Zambia which had absolutely no electricity
and is located in a dangerous area with high rates of domestic violence
It became evident that the lack of electricity
was holding them back and severely curtailing Doras ability
to help develop this village to what its potential could be
Having to wake up thinking what will these kids eat?
That is still very difficult to do each and every day
So we came up with a plan to use the direct sunlight
and scorching heat to our advantage by installing a massive solar grid
that will provide electricity to the entire village
It was then time to turn on the lights and the kids
couldnt contain their excitement
Mateo turn on the lights!
And we have lights!
We then found out about a college kid in Philadelphia that is rescuing
thousands of pounds of food every month because of his school meal swipes
I originally started just as a student with
leftover meal swipes in my dining account
and I realized as I was getting close to the end of the term
I have 50 meals left that I know Im not going to be able to use and
I just had a pit in my stomach thinking about all those meals going to waste
So Darren flew there to meet him and help expand his operation
to a national scale
After witnessing everything that Evan had done to help this community
it didnt take but
an hour to know that we had committed to partnering with Sharing Excess
to help them achieve their goal of feeding as many people as possible
And with our help Sharing Excess were able to open an operation at
Hunts Point Produce Market the largest
produce market in the world in New York City
And that operation
is going to be three times larger than the one that we have in Philly
Next Darren and Dan travelled to the heart of Cameroon
where thousands of children at this school have to share a single toilet
and have lessons in these derelict and dilapidated classrooms
These conditions had no dignity
These conditions would not make a child believe that the future is bright
Once we saw this we knew we had to do something
So almost immediately we started drawing up plans to begin
construction and a few months later the brand new classrooms were built
Just in time to surprise the kids before they return from their holidays
Lastly we flew to Nepal
for a secret project that will be revealed next year
But on that mission Dan and Darren went to 21000 feet high to Mount Everest
to sign out this video where the altitude made Dan very loopy
Darren and I
are at the highest point weve ever been together
Its been one hell of a year
You know weve been working together just one year and look where we are
on top of the world literally and figuratively
And I wouldnt share this experience with anybody else man
Send this to any billionaires you know and tell them to stop buying
cars and instead help people
ITS BEEN SUCH AN INCREDIBLE YEAR
AND WEVE HELPED SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD
BUT NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT YOU
YOU ARE THE HEART AND SOUL OF BEAST PHILANTHROPY
AND WE ARE BEYOND GRATEFUL FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT
HUGE LOVE BEAST PHILANTHROPY
This is a 1 billion super yacht
and its big enough to hold an entire city on the water
How do humans build this stuff?
And Im gonna show you the difference between this
and a 300 million mega yacht a 50 million giga yacht
all the way down to this 1 yacht
Why did you sell me this boat for a dollar?
The storage just kept racking up
Yeah  18000
Its cost you 18 grand a year to store this?
Correct  Interesting
Here you go  Thank you
And after stepping on board
it was pretty clear why this yacht only cost 1
Okay now that were on the water
what are we working with in here?
I dont think the floors supposed to do that
I dont know if this is even worth a dollar
Oh were actually sinking Oh
The boat literally started sinking
right when we put it in the water
Oh my God Lets go
We gotta go up Were sinking
Jump Chandler
My baby!
I paid a dollar for that
That was the 1 yacht
Later in this video we have a 50 million yacht
a 300 million yacht and the 1 billion super yacht
But before all that heres the 1 million yacht
which is a little smaller than I thought it would be
Hop on boys
All right  Lets see the inside
On the 1 million yacht
you get a surprisingly big living room
a lower deck with a master bedroom
another bedroom that I cant stand up in
and then you got some double beds for the kids
Wait you have kids?
Chris Chandler Karl Nolan
Dont worry boys I got this
Coming on the break to break
Please stop Someones gonna send a rescue boat
We need the coast guard
I wonder if I turn this if hell fall
This is fun
For a million dollar boat Im not gonna lie
its a little smaller than I thought
Lets see if these guys watch our videos
Oh my God its Mr Beast
Hey he has seen our channel
Thats pretty funny
So now were going to the 10 million one
10 million?
See ya  Its gonna be great
Oh my God Hes fast
And now we are on the 10 million yacht
Lets check this out
Holy crap the front of the boats huge
Its just way bigger than the last one
Look at the view
Im getting some good sun here
Im really pale
Oh my gosh Yes this is a nice bedroom
For 9 million more I can actually stand up
And right down these stairs are four more massive bedrooms
Why are there two toilets side by side?
Oh thats a bidet Jim
For your butt?
You poop in here
and then you wash your butt in here
Why dont you just use toilet paper?
Youre so American
And upstairs is another seating area
The seats on the 1 million yacht were leather and hot
These are actually soft
Soft and practical
This boat is the nicest boat Ive been on so far
Well just wait until you see the next one
Its massive
And because its so massive I invited all my friends
Go have fun  Go go go
This boat is meant to hold 150 people
Theyre gonna have a lot of fun
Whoa  Oh my God
What is the difference between this and a mansion?
This is a mansion
When does it stop?
Jimmy Im still going
This is definitely the nicest bedroom weve seen so far
And its nice because my head doesnt hit the ceiling
I can barely touch it now
This yacht has a living room an office
a massage parlor two dining rooms and seven bedrooms
This is the best yacht Ive been on so far
Im driving the boat
Its not Feastables
Thank you for saving
my life  Youre welcome
You gotta
Hey buddy are you relaxed?
Yeah I was
Are you done with your massage yet?
Here you go take a bite
Thats some good chocolate
So we got all of the goon squads in here
This is a 25 million boat with 30 rooms
Why are you guys in here?
This bed is so comfortable
Even though this yacht comes with a world class chef
the boys still wanted pizza
So I planned a little surprise
Do you know what were standing on boys?
A boat  A hospital
An H  A boat
A helipad
And Uber conveniently does helicopter deliveries
That cant be real
Oh its real
Is that a helicopter?
I cant believe its actually works
Pizza pizza pizza
All this for some pizza  Woohoo
I am terrified of parallel parking
He just landed a helicopter on a moving boat
Who wants some pizza?
I know youre not supposed to swim
after you eat a bunch of pizza
but youre on  Jump
a 25 million yacht
Which thankfully when you pay 25 million
you can get some jet skis
Tariq flipped the jet ski
Yo Mac Catch this pizza
25 million yacht and Im the only one enjoying it
If you thought this yacht was crazy
look at this video of the 50 million yacht
You know what?
Honestly lets just go to it right now
Zoom in
And now we are on the 50 million yacht
This yacht is over 200 feet long four stories high
can hold over 200 people and comes with a 20 person crew
with this homeless person I found
Sup guys?
When you pay 50 million
youre given this remote that can call the crew
at any time you call me
Sir did you call me?
No I just wanted to show how this works
But thats not the only thing the remote does
They said this TV goes up and down
Thats cool
That is slow dude
Maybe its like
Im gonna go downstairs
you guys go upstairs
Tell me if you find anything cool
Okay  Okay
Bro it is massive
Its like a whole nother boat up here
Jimmy theres nothing cool up here Dont worry
The interesting thing is Ive just been walking
and I dont know if Im at the halfway point
the end of the boat or if I just started
This things huge
Meanwhile Nolan overslept
So he was still trying to find us
Have you seen Mr Beast?
Are you lying to me?
Apparently Pete Davidson is there
If I dont see Pete Davidson
Im gonna sink the 50 million yacht
Meanwhile we noticed another boat was approaching us
and then the owner did this
I was waving at him and he showed me his butt
Thats gonna be someones dad one day dude
All right catch
Where are they going?  Gimme that gimme that
Are they backing away from us
or are we just that much better?
Get em
This is the best  Oh
The guy thats bigger and stronger than all of us did it
Wow Chucky
I wonder what kind of food they got on this yacht
I heard they have lamb
They do not have lamb
Mmhmm  No
Cut to the dinner
Oh man  Whole lamb
Thank you so much
Its really good
What projects
do you have coming up?  Uh Ooh Im very excited
I have a show called Bupkis
coming out on Peacock on May 4th
Three days before my birthday
And while Nolan was still trying to find us
Which direction did Mr Beast go?
We noticed a lot of boats
surrounding our floating billboards
I didnt even know you could put billboards in the ocean
And we thought they might want some chocolate
Im delivering chocolate
Yo you guys want chocolate?
Best chocolate Ive ever had
Lets go  Its so good
Yeah  Let know if this is
the best chocolate bar ever
Oh my God Out of 10 its an 11
Hersheys dont know nothing
Hersheys doesnt know nothing
Everyone agrees its better than Hersheys
You need to try it
Tell me what you think
Honestly way better than Reeses
Thats what I like to hear
What do you give it?
A 10  Im flying Feastable bars
to people
Aye Feastables incoming
Oh no  Let go of the string
One Feastable bar delivered
Hey Karl
theyre trying your gummies
If you wanna try the best chocolate bars cookies
and gummies on the planet?
Go to Walmart 7Eleven or any Albertsons stores right now
or go to feastablescom right now if you wanna order online
Hey what do you think?
This is better than every other chocolate
so why wouldnt you get Deez Nutz?
I agree Put our nuts in your mouth
Oh Alright
At the end of the day Nolan finally found us
We had another five star dinner
And the next morning we boarded
one of the worlds largest yachts
This is the 300 million yacht
and it has over 50 crew members
waiting on your every request
Tons of luxurious rooms
and nine master bedrooms
Oh my gosh Great
Welcome aboard
I literally cant see the top of the boat from here
We are the 69th
largest yacht in the world
Is that a factual statement?
Yes it is  That is crazy
There are six floors a massive pool
and a hot tub with a view
Its ridiculous
Its my favorite boat so far
The 300 million yacht comes with a stateoftheart gym
that overlooks the ocean
Oh what?
Dude if my boat had a gym Im working out
A movie theater with windows that auto darkened
whenever you watch something
And even the table is worth 3 million
and the piano plays itself
I want one of these in my house
All the boys disappeared in the spa
Come with me
Oh youre getting a haircut?
Yeah Karl was in the sauna
That does not look comfortable
And I dont even know where Nolan is
Oh its so hot
Man really got in a hot tub
with a sunburn  Its too hot
Dude theres more downstairs?
Whoa  Oh my gosh
You think they have enough jet skis?
Whats behind this door?
Oh Im doing this
One of us is getting thrown off the side of the boat
He was last  Bye
Hey always always be ready for nose goes
Jimmy can we eat some food?
Yeah when you get back
Boys we must act like rich billionaires
Would you rather have 300 1 million ships
or one 300 million ship?
You could almost have one
for every different day of the year
Im not gonna take care of 300 boats
Which would you rather have?
300 boats or one big boat?
You want the big boat?
Gentlemen did any of you notice a boat pulling up?
On that boat might be Tom Brady
By might I mean it is
And we should probably go say hi to him
Hey Tom  Whats up guys?
And if you dont know who Tom Brady is
he is the number one quarterback in NFL history
So this is where you get your haircut on the boat
So it turns into a dentistry  Where you wash
Clean your teeth too
Is this the nicest boat
youve been on?  My God are you kidding me?
Yeah  Its crazy
if you eat too many Deez Nutz bars before breakfast
I literally had to hide them in my house
because I knew these two would sneak
to right where theyre at  Yeah
I did This place is so fun
Its really an endless maze
I think its a nicest boat in the world
Thats what we do  Its so beautiful
Its crazy  We still have more floors
to go on  Tariqs the master
of the camera
Thank you thank you
This is a way nicer helicopter pad
When I think of a helicopter pad on a yacht
this is what I think of
Not what we had before
And with Tom Brady here of course
we had to play some football
This is the most fun version of catch
cause you just do this and he just throws it there
I just suck
Thats what I got paid for Jimmy Come on
I wanna see if you could hit my drone out of the sky
Oh no  with a football
All right if I hit the drone on the first try
maybe I should come out of retirement
I like that  Dad youre gonna like miss
I probably will miss
First try
Go go go  Oh
He got it
Nolan put your sunscreen on
Karls probably the worst
wide receiver youve ever thrown to
Unless you dome him in the head
hes probably not gonna catch it
All right Karl dont screw this up
Just throw it as far as you can
You hit him in the chest
You gotta hit him in the head  Its a bad placing
After chilling with Tom Brady
we hung out in the movie room for the rest of the night
Would you say this is the best boat so far?
100  But keep in mind
theres still a billion dollar boat after this
How big can that get?
It is four times bigger than this boat
These things get bigger?
This ship is bigger than three statues of liberty
Holy crap
You cannot fathom how massive this ship is
It is literally a floating city
that is 1200 feet wide and 17 stories high
and it fits almost 10000 people
In all the other ships we had our own rooms
but this ship has over 2000 rooms
This boat has water slides an indoor mall
a basketball court and tons of other stuff
I cant even name
I ran out of fingers
All of which we have to ourselves
Have fun boys  Yeah yeah
Brother its that way
Oh okay  Lets see what happens
Whoa theres a water slide
Theres a whole entire waterpark up here
Im breaking the rules
Were running were running
Sorry lifeguard
They literally have live music in the waterpark
What the heck?  Theres even an entire
sports floor that has everything you can imagine
Mini golf  Lets go
Were literally playing mini golf on a ship right now
And I wasnt exaggerating
when I said this ship is a city
Theres literally seven neighborhoods on this ship
This is insane
Were still on a ship
And just for reference this is what one
of those neighborhoods look like
So I went down to the slide
and now Im teleported into like a different world
And you have a carousel?
They have shops restaurants arcades even a Starbucks
Hey  A hundred million people
are watching
Lets see if you make the shot
Like how can I use all these seats?
Im only one person
And apparently theres an entire floor
for indoor shows and events
What is this bro?
We got the whole ship to ourselves
selves selves selves selves selves selves
Obviously I dont need this giant ship all to myself
so I wanted to share this experience with you guys
my subscribers
I love Mr Beast
Subscribe to Mr Beast
Holy cow this boat
Its actually pretty nice
Lets go boys Lets get it
Were gonna go ride the carousel

Come on come one come on
Thumbnail this
Wait wait dont hold this That your sht thumbnail
water splashing contestants laughing
We are now stranded on a raft in the middle of the ocean
and there goes our boat
We are now stranded for seven days
How much longer?  Seven days
This raft is literally countless miles
from the nearest civilization
And whether we like it or not
my four friends and I are stuck on this raft
And its not going to be easy This is brutal
It wont stop raining! Were all at rock bottom now
This challenge went from fun to a literal nightmare
Very fast
Bro look how far away the boat is
So step one
Were going to get sunburned if we dont get shade
And I had survival specialists
equip this raft with tons of wood rope and everything else
We would need to build ourselves a shelter
Boys we need to get started We are running out of light!
I got this My finger!
Now we set these up like a teepee
We picked the worst day to start
As you can tell by the clouds its literally about the storm
So first thing we want to do is set up some structure to cover us
since were on this slab of wood for the next seven days
we need a place to hide from the sun
so we dont get sunburned
So two birds one stone
Speaking of birds while we were building
this happened  A bird!
Its coming right at us!  Oh my god! Its a bird!
We should name him  Whats his name?
Bryan Bryan Bryan Bryan
What if you went and got some fish?
I know hes looking at me He understands
Jimmy just say the word  Put the knife away
Okay Ill put the knife away  And the hatchet
Bryan that was a joke
Forget the bird We got to build a shelter
Were making friends  While Bryan watched
We worked on our first shelter for the rest of the day
Except for my friend Tareq
who spent the entire day getting cool drone shots
And Im not even mad about it
Inside this crate is the food for all
five of us for the next seven days
And in these two barrels
is our entire water supply for all five of us
How does it taste?
Very hot Were screwed
There was dirt in my cup
Its getting dark and that crate has the word sleep on it
Hopefully the survival guides gave us something soft
Why are they wet?  Things do get wet on a boat
Im ready for bed I wanna go to sleep
This is night one and Bryan is just yawning
This is miserable
This is all the coverage we have
I didnt realize what I was signing up for Its hot
This thing will not stop swaying and I feel like Im going to puke
And Im surrounded by a bunch of sweaty people
Aye sweaty men
If you guys smell this bad on day one
what are you going to smell like on day 7?
Our first night of sleep was really rough
Sleeping is impossible
These waves are just making me miserable
And to make matters worse our best friend Bryan ended up
leaving us that morning
Bryan! Bryan!
But regardless todays objective is to build ourselves
a permanent weatherproof shelter
How do we turn that into a livable structure?
Theres definitely something here
Luckily I had them throw a bunch of wood on the raft
so we could build a nice house
How we build the house?
Im not quite sure but they said this is enough to build a house
But ironically right as we got started
Its raining!  Dont throw it!
Jimmy get my shark pillow!
This is miserable!
This is bad
Oh Jesus Christ
Youre not doing the right thing Nolan
Listen with your ears!  Why do you yell so much!
Because you dont listen!  I wanna hit Nolan!
Its just rain  Shut up!
At least we dont have to shower
Yeah This is so bad
And we still have over six days left
Where do we go poop?
Oh we have to build the pooper  What?
We have to build everything thats here
We have to build the toilet
Build our shelter the fire everything
The moment the rain finished
the boys and I needed to build all of our survival essentials
Starting with the shelter
Tearing it down in the name of something better
Five minute break for Chris
I also need a break
Im seasick Im out of it
You got to pick this up I cant
I cant pick it up anymore
I feel like youre doing all the work
but we got two other goofs just laying down
Im miserable
We built one wall
Yeah we built one wall  All together
All of us
Regardless of being seasick
it was going to take all of us if we wanted to finish this
Now you guys bring it forward There we go
How many YouTubers does it take to build a little structure?
Wait? Is that a whale?
Think thats a whale? Thats insane
Its unreal  There are actually whales
This experience just keeps getting better
Shelter water not being near Nolan
Im never going to take that for granted again
Probably would have been really useful to build the ladder first
We got a ladder I literally just built just 4 minutes ago
After hours of building we were finally getting somewhere
I severely regret making this a seven day challenge
instead of a 50 hour challenge
Like all our other videos We keep rocking back and forth
Its freakin miserable Im going to puke
And finally just as the sun was going down
Camp is now organized  Yeah!
Night two my bed is still broken but Im going to get some sleep
tonight because Im that tired
Im gonna head to bead Did I wake you?
Just go back to bed Im just vlogging
I accidentally woke Lazar up I feel bad now
This might be the most tired
Ive ever been in my entire life
Its now day three
And somehow our building didnt fall over
Ill take that as a dub
The noises that the structure made
while I was sleeping last night
filled me with nightmares
Its day three and weve really started to get into a rhythm
Our morning routine consisted of peeing in the corner
Bro who vlogs in the pee corner?
Im not moving
eating our breakfast  Surviving on Feastables
Its all you need?
and drinking hot barrel water
So dehydrated I need this
Were about 36 hours in and were almost halfway
through a barrel of water  Is that slow or fast
Were going to run out on day six
Running low on water and food gave me an idea
Im kind of curious to see whats under the boat people do
Theres so many fish below us!
So we decided
to try and catch some dinner but we werent very good at it
Why does it take so long?
I just want something to put my stomach
Bryan help us catch fish!
Turns out fishing is a lot harder than YouTube
After hours we caught absolutely nothing
Why cant we catch anything? Oh I give up
We were tired dehydrated and hungry
Which forced us to dig into our rations
Lets have ourselves a feast
Yeah! Call it a Feastables
In our supplies
We had wood to build a fire and pans to cook with
You take big stick and make really little sticks
and then make medium sticks
Then use the big sticks at the end
Look at them beans baby!
Im so excited This looks awesome
These are really good Can you tell weve been
at sea for three days?
Literally  When have I ever been this excited
over canned chili?
Hey I put some love into this one
Its not just canned chili anymore
Its got tomatoes kidney beans
You dont have to keep talking Im already drooling
This was our first
hot meal in days but it was also a good chunk of our rations
so we made sure to enjoy it
I feel a lot better
I think the first two days were definitely the most miserable
I think were slowly like losing our minds
and its actually becoming bearable
I still havent gone to the bathroom
Thats my biggest concern you know?
Im struggling to sleep
This raft is just rocking like crazy
Definitely Im kind of miserable
Hopefully tomorrow is better
None of us managed to get any sleep
We lost the back of our fort last night
The house needs some repairs
Tensions are pretty high on the raft this morning
Nolans a little upset He broke his bed
Nolan is struggling
Hes just in his feels right now
Itll be okay
He probably wouldve quit the channel if I did that
This is easily the worst
Oh theres thunder
I swear If it starts raining again
Oh I cant take that
And to make matters worse
we accidentally dropped our ladle in the drinking water
And since we havent showered in four days
grabbing it technically contaminated the drinking water
Im never drinking out of that again
Fast forward to when we run out of water
Because of the contamination
a third of our water was no longer safe to drink
Whatever reason the more I suffer the more you guys watch
some of our most popular videos
are when I buried myself alive spent time in solitary confinement
So I hope youre happy Im suffering again
Its not easy surviving on a raft but after four long days
Lazars finally pooping
Can you play a celebratory song?
LazarBeam is
pooping  Is pooping
See how all those clouds over there are dark?
Yeah Theyre going to pour down on us tonight
Tonights going to suck
We didnt know it yet
but the biggest storm of the entire challenge was headed right
towards us
And when we saw it approaching
we tried to prepare as much as possible
Cant wait for another storm just to destroy all this again
Tareqs fixing his side of the fort
Chris is fixing the roof and Im now the cameraman
for some reason
Theres a stormabrewing
And while theyre preparing the shelter
for the storm Im going to tell you about Shopify
because it might literally storm until the end of the challenge
This is going to be a bit rocky
Shopify is a platform that makes it easy for anyone
to start a business
They literally support millions of small businesses
all around the world from selling wood
to nails to crates to
Crocs they support businesses that sell it on Shopify
Assuming were going to have absolutely zero tops
covering this structure
I am worried about it
100 of what I sell online from merch to Feastables
I do with Shopify
Its actually getting pretty rocky out here
The wind is getting crazy!  Were out of nails!
Its really hard to work around the wind guys
Stop yelling and do things!
Shopify even has a new AI tool called Sidekick
making running your entire business easier
Just like surviving on this raft can be hard
so can entrepreneurship
And thats why they do everything in their power
to make it as easy as possible
This is my worst nightmare  Im so miserable!
Go to ShopifycomMrBeast
to give it a try right now Thank you Shopify
Lets go prep for the storm
Im soaking wet!
Maybe you can start helping us Jimmy
I was paying for the raft!
The storm was really starting to pick up
but that night it got so much worse
This really puts the helter in the shelter right?
Oh no you!
Its leaking!  Oh no
This shelter is the opposite of waterproof
This is brutal
We have three more
The next three days by the way
No!  Theres water everywhere
Its useless
This does nothing
This is the most insane night yet
We are struggling right now
Is this safe anymore?
We couldve just filmed this in a studio
but no we have to be the real channel
that doesnt fake things
Were gonna die!
Were getting just destroyed Im getting hit
Theres a hole that is completely opened up over my bed
I cant do this
I cant do this  You can end this video Jimmy
Jimmy please
I tried to talk all you guys out of it
You all said yes!
This is the worst experience Ive ever had in my entire life
I hate every part of this
Im just miserable right now
The storm was reaching a new peak with every passing hour
We were desperate so we tried using our beds
as literal walls to protect us from the rain
Were all at rock bottom now
Its been raining for a few hours
Its freezing cold
We dont have beds Im getting nauseous
I dont know if were going to make it
these full seven days at this point
It rained nonstop for around 20 hours straight
and after
standing the whole night completely soaked and exhausted
we had to push ourselves to dry off our supplies and rebuild camp
Our raft is just in shambles
Look at our beds were drying them off
This is harder than Antarctica
This is harder than the desert video
Im just ready to be home
I hate this raft
I never want to see it again
Our entire fire pit is completely drenched
We couldnt start a fire if we wanted to tonight No dinner
And to make matters worse all of our food was completely soaked
Meaning only a portion of it was still safe to eat
We had stability we had food we had dry beds
and we took it for granted
We cant take another night like that
We need to waterproof the shelter
We just ripped that off
to tide it here and then well leave it there
But this time we have this
Last night we were shivering cold
and wanted to die
So would you rather be warm and dry or cold and wet?
Put a zip tie here
Tie a rope to that zip tie there
We can use that to push us up so we get even more room
Im thinking why dont I make a really big clothesline and hang up
all our wet stuff?
Maybe well have dry towels by tomorrow
I want to die
Im sunburned tired dehydrated and did I say tired?
After fixing camp we were so exhausted
that we spent most of the day sleeping
But at least when we woke up
we were reunited with a familiar friend
Bryan!  Bryan! Bryan!
Bryan!  Bryan!
Bryan come back!
After being stuck in a raft for five days with these guys
This really is a nightmare
Ill admit it
I missed Bryan  Hes moved on
You may not have given up on Bryan but Bryan gave up on you
Bryans given up on us
We have two days left Were running out of food
Our water is contaminated and were all borderline dying
Im going crazy
These last two days will be interesting
What could go wrong now?
I can literally see 500 fish down there
Oh my gosh This poop bucket stinks
I almost had a mental breakdown last night
I was shivering wet the entire time
Could not sleep
It was one of the worst nights of my life
Last night shivering in the torrential rain
in the middle of the deep dark ocean
You know we got through it
Now the end of this challenge could not come soon enough
Making the challenge 7 days was a horrible decision
This is so much harder
The new reinforced waterproof fortress actually worked
Lannan said
it rained last night did it?
At 4 am sprinkled a little
Hey heres the beauty
I didnt even know
That was the best sleep Ive ever gotten
I actually got a full nights sleep last night
I can barely even open my eyeballs
I would say this is the hardest challenge weve ever done
adding the extra five days on the end of a 50 hour challenge
definitely makes it harder
The fact that were just drifting at sea
on this hunk of wood thats pretty impressive
And while it seemed like the rain was over
we found ourselves encountering a new obstacle
Weve gone from shivering cold like two nights ago
to being scorching hot unbelievably hot
Im about to jump in the water because Im getting too hot
Were going to go swimming
I hope Nolan can swim
And while they cooled off in their own way
we got creative with ours
Oh yes
Its fans Cold air
I feel amazing
A jellyfish bit me!
Why does the ocean hate us?
I knew it was a great idea not to go swimming
Are you okay?  Oh my leg!
I found the sweet spot
Yeah I got a little welts and some red lines
For the majority of the day it was so hot
we literally couldnt walk on the deck
Yeah Im hot
I dont want to be alive Im hot
Its very hot
But as the sun went down we were optimistic
about reaching the finish line
We have less than 24 hours left in the challenge
This has genuinely been
the hardest challenge video Ive ever been a part of
Honestly this whole experience has made me appreciate
all the things we take for granted in life
Like your shower your food
I miss food
A working toilet
I never want to poop in a bucket again
I say we celebrate making it this far with a Feastable bar
Yes available in every Walmart Target 7Eleven Albertsons
in America Its 2023
If youre still buying Hersheys its kind of lame
Hersheys for the boomers
Oh Jimmy  How did you break the chair?
what is happening?
Jimmy Im starting to think you ate all the food
I guess Ill just continue the timelapse with a broken chair
This is our final night sleeping together everybody
Oh Im so glad to sleep alone
Im gonna miss sleeping by your side
100 I would not rather sleep next to any other man
And with that Im going to bed
After an amazing nights sleep we were visited by a familiar face
Bryan brought his family to say goodbye to us on the last day
Thank you Bryan That meant a lot
Its almost like we were family to Bryan
We were
He kept us safe during like the night we had the least shelter
Maybe hes just a pea brain bird
Shut up  Nolan Off the rack
I wish  That was emotional
Everythings going full circle
We had so many crazy memories in this raft
Yeah and I think my best memory is going to be leaving
We spent over 150 hours on this floating piece of wood
And even though it was easily the hardest thing Ive ever done
the boys and I still had some good times
Wheres this boat?  Wheres the boat?
The boat!
Then finally the end was literally in sight
The boat its coming!
Alert the ship of our location
Signaling the boat!
Boat! Boat! Boat!
Why is it moving so abnormally slow?
Oh my God!  Im getting off this raft

MrBeast You guys spammed me to plant 20 million trees
on Twitter Reddit all over my comment section
So I made it happen
Today we will be planting 20 million trees
And we put em in the hole
Now we need mulch
Put the mulch around the tree
and we hydrate it
And there we go bell dings
And again
Hole tree mulch water
And before we go any further this is Sarah
Shes a tree planting expert
Will this tree grow to be big and healthy?
Im gonna look and see if I can pull on it
and it doesnt pull out of the planting hole
triumphant jingle So good job there
Only 19999980 more trees
all cheer Yeah!
Oh yeah  Sturdy?
Oh very sturdy bell dings
You could tug on this with a rope
and it wouldnt come out bell dings
Chris I need help Can you massage my tree for me?
Massage your tree?
I cant get it out of this pot
Dude its like rock solid in here
There you go bell dings
So talking to trees makes them grow faster?
Grow! What do you want the planet to die come on
Grow  Can you grow!
Do you see the sky? Its so beautiful
Youre gonna be a house for birds and stuff
hands whacking
You got toughen these trees up
Look at this No movement
So the reason were spacing the trees eight feet apart
is so the roots have to grow out
and they dont have to compete
Its kind of weird to put mulch around a growing tree
cause its grinding up all of its relatives
and spreading it around them
All right well its started to rain
At least now we dont have to water the trees
No but seriously we wanna plant 20 million trees
and a little bit of rain never hurt anyone
If a tree falls in the woods
and no ones around to hear it does it make noise?
Yes Its still a tree
Cameraman Plant a tree in the middle of the forest
Hold on Ive gotta do something important
Oh okay Timber! explodes
Why are you mad?
bells dings
Its a hole  With a tree in it
Look at this tree!
Look jeans squelching
You see that?
man screaming
After planting all day
we only managed to plant 300 trees
Which is less than 20 million and my back hurts
I put out a tweet and I have tons of people
coming here tomorrow to plant trees
I think Ive got an idea for a drone
So I havent mentioned this yet but this is Mark Rober
This is his channel
He used to work at NASA he put this thing on Mars
He does a lot of cool things
Hes gonna try with the drone
and were gonna try with people
Play to your strengths
May the the alright
Its day number two and we brought a lot more people
crowd cheering
And now were gonna try to plant the 20 million trees
So step one is we need to give everyone their tree
Can I have a fist bump?  Yes
Heres your tree  I shall name him Russell
Look at all these people
Were easily gonna hit 20 million
electronic upbeat tune
And now its time to begin
Lets plant the trees
crowd cheering Unless youre him
He already planted it
Youre doing great  Great good job
Do you need help?
If you would like to help go for it
Dig right here seems like the best spot
The holes too big
dramatic music
Tree review rock music
See the tug test?
You dont want any oxygen in the root system
or the tree wont survive
What are these people doing?
Thats a solid tree
Thats a solid boy?  Thats a solid tree
Okay good  Thats great
Whoever planted that amazing
Make sure you want to do a donut
Can I believe in you? bell dings
Thank you so much for helping us do this by the way
Howd you hear about this?
Oh I saw the tweet Had to hop in
Ooh Not bad  Fits well I like it
Thanks for helping with my tree man
Of course  Appreciate it
Nice to meet you  Nice to meet you as well
I was honestly like I have to do this
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity
Were gonna get to the 20 mill right?
Oh 100 No doubt  Alright cool
Interview conducted

upbeat music bell dinging
Do a little tug test Oh shes nice
Oh shes nice
We just need some  There we go
Thats a good tree man  Good job Chris
Dude thanks  Got em!
He gets a high five you know whatever
The last tree  Thanks Chandler
As you can see there are a ton of trees here
Now we actually grabbed a drone shot beforehand
So heres the drone shot of the empty field
Look at it Its empty
And heres the drone shot now Is that a lot of extra trees?
Yes its quite extra
We had to Yeah
Unfortunately despite having a large number of people
we came nowhere near close to planting 20 million trees
But I dont wanna let you guys down
So I devised a plan
where we can actually plant 20 million trees
but I need your help
We partnered with the largest nonprofit
tree planting organization in the world Arbor Day
But we need your help
Every dollar donated they will plant a tree Watch
Heres a dollar and I donated it
Another dollar another tree
Heres 10 and I just donated it
bell dings
This is 30 and guess what happens when I donate it?
Even Chandler can do it
And another one
Arbor Day and their partners are the pros
Theyve planted hundreds of millions of trees
theyll make sure they have a high rate of survivability
and they genuinely do care
If you donate a dollar
something like this ends up in the ground
And given enough time this will turn into this masterpiece
Now one thing I want to address
I personally havent always been
the most environmentally friendly
Weve burnt the box for it
and weve done many other dumb things
And a lot of you might be of the mindset of the old me
That was basically someone else will figure it out
But thats not how it works
We genuinely need all the help we can get
And honestly Ive done everything I can
I got a bunch of fans together
and we planted thousands of trees
Me and mark have invested months of time behind the scenes
into getting this all together
And Im personally planting a hundred thousand trees
AKA a hundred thousand dollars donation
Ive literally tried my best to do everything I can
And now its your guys turn
You guys have been spamming my comment section
and spamming my mentions on Twitter
telling me to do something
And now I wanna see that same energy
We only have one earth
and its important we take care of it
Recently lots of not so great things
have been happening to forests
and people just keep making fun of our generation
for retweet activism and not actually doing something
Which is why we created teamtreesorg
with the help of the Arbor Day Foundation
This is your chance to make a difference
For every dollar you donate here on YouTube
or at teamtreesorg a tree will be planted
And the Arbor Day Foundation
are really good at what they do
These trees will have
an extremely high rate of survivability
Please donate now
Dont push it off till later you might forget
This is our chance to show the world we care
Teamtreesorg donate there

How water bottles are made
That doesnt it look like a water bottle?
Oh all right
You just squeeze it with metal and then it inflates
They all probably come like that
so that way they can have different shapes
for different bottles
And they inflate it to the bottle they want
So that way you can buy a ton of them
and make different bottles in the factories
Oh really that actually does make sense
And that is all just speculation from me
that could be totally false but who cares?
This is our channel

Okay this has to be good
You start with poo poo
But wait thats brown And Oreos are black
Well its probably when you bake em they turn
Whoa when you bake your poop it turns black?
Heres what they should do
they should just take this and just break it
cause we just want the white stuff in the middle
I think I speak for everyone
Why dont they do an Oreo where
its the white stuff is on the outside
and then theres one little thin black cookie
In the middle?
Oh that would be good
What if they came out with a new Oreo
and its called just the white stuff
Can I just buy white stuff cream?
Yeah its not even packaged
its just squirted into a Ziploc bag
And they need to call it the white stuff
The white stuff
Yeah see no those arent good
look at that
The chocolate to the white ratio is so off
Not on this one though
this ones thick  Yeah that one is fine
But like all these other ones I dont like my Oreos
when theres not much white stuff in them
This whole conversation becomes irrelevant
when you say vanilla Oreos
because vanilla Oreos are incredible
I still would rather eat a vanilla Oreo
without the top than with the top
We dont have to agree on everything
But we can agree its better than chocolate
Yes very good
Im glad we discussed this we got to this conclusion

Subscribe if you wanna win money
Hopefully we wont get sued bye
This is a 100 million megamansion and its possibly
the most luxurious house ever built by mankind
And were going to be comparing living in this house
to living in this 69 million art house
thats built to withstand a literal tsunami
a 30 million palace with its very own waterpark
and everything in between all the way down
to this 1 barely functioning house
More of a shed
Well its only a dollar
Why does this house cost a dollar?
Yeah we get another storm its probably going to go into the water
So its worth a dollar for me just to get rid of it
So you would say this is a horrible investment for me?
Yes indeed  Lets do it
This is sketchy
What are the odds I fall through?
Pretty high
Bro these are wobbly
I like how that chair is just like holding on for dear life
We have a recliner a mattress and half a floor
I can literally fish from inside of the house
Yo I caught one
Thats just the lure Im sorry
Now that you see us having fun do you regret selling it?
I do not
What if I gave you 2 to buy back off me?
No  Alright I tried
I have an idea
Lets get out of this house
we have a house that cost 100 million times more than this
And because I never plan on setting foot in this worthless shack again
Lets head over to something a little nicer
Speaking of which were at the million dollar house
which technically means you need to be a millionaire to buy this house
Lets show you how a millionaire lives
My first impression is its way bigger than my house
When you pay 1000000 you get a pretty good sized kitchen
along with four bedrooms that look normal
But they keep going
because this bedroom has a closet here which leads into a bathroom
thats bigger than the 1 house
The bathtub is gigantic
Im six foot five and I can fit in this perfectly comfortable
And even though the bathrooms are all stocked with bidets
Oh God!
The best seat in the house is definitely downstairs
Oh snap! They have a movie theater
Dude these chairs are massage chairs
Wait what?
These chairs each have two remotes
Two remotes!
On top of the movie theater theres also an arcade
I was not expecting all these features for 1 million
This house is awesome
Id have so much more friends
If I owned a place like this
and ending with the pool which comes complete
with this unnecessary waterfall
Overall Id say this is a pretty fun house to live in
But of course were all here to see the richest of the rich
And thats why up next we have these 15 million
15 million house
Wait you pushed it?
Jeez man
I dont belong here
This looks like the house that you tried to get to in GTA
That view is crazy
The pool is much smaller than the 1 million house
but you can literally oversee all of LA
Hey! Help!
Stop Stop
Go inside
I need new friends
Lets check out the house The person who owns this house
What do you think he does for a living?
Hes a lawyer
This guy was the top attorney in 2017 and the number one lawyer in 2021
Apparently thats all it takes to afford this house
It appears a note was left for us
Dear MrBeast thank you for visiting my home
You have given me the ultimate gift
I have a trump card with my kids forever
Also please dont eat any of the sandwiches
They are very sacred to me
and my familys been passing it down from generation to generation
Got it
Down or up?  Down
Down it is
Okay now its starting to look nice
The lower floor of this mansion
comes with its very own movie theater and personal gym
This treadmill requires a passcode to use
Six nine six nine
Its not six nine six nine
A guest bedroom an entertainment area and a bar where the owner left us
a bunch of free food
Guys before you eat anything  Yeah
What if he left this out  so he could sue us for eating his
Well too late now Karl ate it
And an incredible underground view of the swimming pool
Nolans trying to swim in the background for the shot
I dont think he realized we stopped filming him
Back again?
Yeah do it one more time
And now a master bedroom with another crazy view
Karl come here
You missed
We got another one
You missed again
Oh wait! Nolan stop it!
Nolan stop this cushion also
Stop throwing cushions
If it goes over the edge he might sue me
And so to avoid being handed court papers we decided to fly all the way
across the country to Massachusetts for the 30 million dollar house
This extraordinary 16 bedroom estate has four different buildings
In the main house
There are multiple living rooms but this one is the best
of the living rooms in this property
This is grand
What is this?  The Oval Office
What book would you expect here
besides The Way To Wealth by Benjamin Franklin
Bro made the light bulb and a book?
Well Edison made the light bulb Not Ben Franklin
What the hell did Ben Franklin do?
Im going to read this book
Past the living room in the office
was the Grand Kitchen where the owner had left a little gift for us
The owner of this place got rich making candles
So he made us custom MrBeast candles
That one smells like the beach
How do they put the beach in a candle?
And to top off the houses main building
Chandler discovered that
You can hit golf balls off the roof
Thats not even close to the coolest thing about this place
because next door is a garage filled with exotic cars
This looks like a garage out of a video game
They got Lamborghinis on top of Lamborghinis
Its like a candy store for adults
The best part is this is just one of two car garages
Follow me  Theres more?
Bro theres more cars in here than the other one
Holy crap!
All right now I am convinced if we steal a car he would not notice
How do you even buy these cars? Hey I want three of the same ones
Its like a full time job to buy this many cars
Theres stairs in the corner Lets see where they go
Bro this is like a closet with cars
Underneath the car garage is another army of cars
They should really invest in a light switch down here
They have 20 cars down here but no lights
Did I?  No way!
No way!
Thats why there wasnt a light switch
I was like who can afford to shove 30 cars
in their basement but not electricity?
Now dont get me wrong all of the rooms
in this house have been awesome so far
But if I owned it I dont think Id ever leave this next building
Thats right
For some just ungodly reason whoever built this place thought
it would be a good idea to install an entire indoor tennis court
I just want to remind you that we are playing tennis inside a house
I also have no idea how to play tennis
Gang squad follow me
What? No way!
Two story arcade
The arcade in this house
is actually 20 times bigger than the one at the 1 million house
But thats not all
Bro this place literally has everything
All right Im never leaving
Were playing ping pong in a basketball court in a house
First try baby!
Now all of the features of the 30 million house have been pretty cool
But this next room is what makes this place truly special
Head up these stairs for the best part of the estate
What you really want to see is right over here look at this
This is an indoor waterpark
Its like a whole new world in here
Look how far back the drone is and its still going
Go have fun but dont break anything
Roger that
Were all about to go down the slide together
Were going to enjoy the waterpark
Ill see you at the next house
The only bad news is its once again across the entire country
The good news is its a 45 million megamansion
What!  Oh my gosh
This is like the most open house Ive ever been in
I dont know what majestic thing this is but its beautiful
As you can probably tell
these houses are starting to get so expensive
I dont even know how to describe them anymore
Honestly lost for words
This is quite possibly the most beautiful thing Ive ever seen
So I called in multibillionaire Mark Cuban to help us out
Hows it going?  Hey!
Hows it going little man?  Nice to meet you
Marks also the proud owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team
And because this house has its very own basketball court
you can imagine we got a little distracted
Jimmy wont make it!  Buckets!
Just steal it from Karl
Hit that
No shot  We get those
Yeah thats it
Go go go go go Easy lay bud
There we go Jakes play wins All you Hit it Game winner
Way to dominate Jakers
Now were going to show Mark around the rest of the house
Now that were all sweating
To find out if he thought it was worth the steep 45 million price
In case youre wondering we didnt go swimming
It looks like I did go swimming
How much do they want for this house?  45
Not worth it?  Because its Brentwood
Thats probably half of it
Is Brentwood what that is?
No the neighborhood
I also thought he was talking about the wood in the house
Thats funny
This bathroom over here its nice
Do you have a couch in your bathroom?
Yes  Oh really?
Okay We need to get on Marks level
The number one rule is you have to have a heated seat
Thats it?
That feeling when you sit down  And it is not cold?
You dont need to make billions to be happy
You just need to be able to afford a bidet and a heated toilet seat
Cause thats where I spend most of my time
Well even though Im sure Mark would love to spend more time
here on the toilets our time here is officially ran out
And so Ill see you guys at the next house
Up next we have a house whose price point happens
to be my favorite number
And now we are at the 69 million mansion
That looks like a villain owns it
It does look villainous
Hows this compare to your house Miranda?
Its a lot bigger than mine
That cant be sure Whats your address?
The reason why this weird looking house can still go on the market
for 69 million is because its filled to the brim
with priceless art and sculptures sourced from all around the world
Throw up how much these artworks are worth
and were going to try to guess it How much do you think this is worth?
Im going to say 100000
What do you think Miranda?  Im going to go with 80
Oh she has one of these in her house
Yeah I have the same one
Only you know the actual price
Oh actually this one will be a fun one
Im going to go with 1000000 because its like right down
the opening stairs so
Very precise  Very specific
The 30 million house
had a waterpark a hundred cars
This place just has artwork
Big red sculpture
This room over here we promised them 30 times
we wouldnt touch whats in it
No touching anything what is it?
This is a one of one fully analog custom home sound system
made by the creator of the Walkman which was one of the first devices
that allowed you to listen to music while walking
Thats an impressive thing to have under your belt
To have made the Walkman
I dont think you could fit this under your belt
Lets traverse across the skywalk
Oh my God Im excited
Another reason this house is built so strange
For example having to walk across SkyBridge is to get anywhere
is because its been meticulously built
to be able to withstand the force of a real tsunami
I mean you got to admit thats pretty cool
You can see the tsunamis before they hit your house and you stop them
What completes the view is the neighbors backyard
You can see all of it
What if the man who lives here is secretly in love
with the person that lives next door?
Thats his ex girlfriend
Its a Romeo and Juliet
And after checking out the last two rooms inside
I had a surprise waiting for us outside
Look over there
Deez nuts
Did you guys even notice the planes drawing that?
How on earth did they do that?
I paid these planes and also about a thousand billboards
all across America to let everyone know
that Feastables is the best tasting chocolate you can buy
Stop eating Hersheys and other boomer brands Feastables is modern chocolate
Also because halloween is coming up in all these retailers
you see here were now
selling these bags of these smaller pieces bars
so you can give them out during trick or treating
If you dont want to be lame on Halloween
make sure you give away Feastables to trickortreaters
Luckily our candy is pretty affordable
but you know whats not so affordable?
The final house or should I say
the 139 million
arguably most luxurious house on the planet MegaMansion
This massive
36000 square foot mansion has things you never see in any other house
from a nightclub to a TRex to an entire robotic car elevator
This place is going to blow your mind and to make this house tour
extra special we brought Justin Timberlake
How you guys doing?
And this is Justins house and hes going to show us around
Have you ever seen a view better than this in your life?
This is gorgeous  Yeah man you guys really
The CGI is perfect it looks real
Hes like Yeah maybe its top 10
Ill put it top five
Its hard to describe just how big this mansion really is
It has 12 bedrooms and 17 bathrooms split across three massive
stories all with a perfect view of the Los Angeles skyline
I always judge a house by the kitchen minimalist kitchen
You judge these things How are you feeling?
Well lets keep going
At the end of the tour well get his opinion on
if he would pay 100 million
He has it on standby if he likes it
Straight cash homie
Everything in this house is built out of the most expensive materials
on the planet
For example the walls in this room are constructed entirely out of rare
marble imported straight from Italy
You guys got to get an estimate or something
on how much marble is actually in this house
I mean thats a thats like custom done
Yeah theres not a single thing of drywall in this entire house
This is a pretty sick chandelier
This chandelier is over 1000000
And the ceiling literally started dipping
because it weighs so many thousands of pounds
It really keeps going
You didnt tell me it was a million I was playing with it earlier
There is literally 6 million of just chandeliers in this house
and the rooms on the bottom floor get even better
Theres a whole other house down here
If you come over here
Dude this is literally an ice room
This is where you lock me in?  No
Please dont
So what do you do in here?
They ran out of room ideas
Probably a 50 chance were locked in here
because that doesnt have a handle
Oh no Were good
That would have been funny if we were
His face
Is that a real dinosaur?
Now that you know the house has a dinosaur are you more apt to buy it?
Im still on the fence
Is this a locker room?
No one currently owns this house
so they put nametags of the few people
on the planet that can actually afford it
Warren Buffetts worth like 80 billion Ellisons worth like 50 billion
Bezos Like 100 billion
Chandler why is your name not up here?
All right lets check out the whips
Nolan are you just posing?  Ill just be sitting here
You really match the house
I was going for that I was going for that
Job well done
Nolans going to go in the editing room and clip that
This 25 million car elevator
is one of the most insane features in the whole house
You select which car you want to drive on the tablet
and it literally sends it up two floors right into the garage
I know what youre thinking
The main problem with this is it only stores
Six Lamborghinis and  Yeah
You needed like a ten car storage
This house also had the by far
biggest home theater Ive ever seen in my life
This almost looks like a real movie theater
This is the best movie theater so far
And theyre actually reclining chairs
It only costs 100 mil for that
Check it out Jimmy Wait press my massage button
I got you
Hey! I dont need this
Bro wheres my button? My chairs not even doing that
Here switch Let me see
Yeah Chandler test the massage feature
Oh my god it works
No way this is just the only one here
Man This is great
Bro what is wrong with them?
All right lead the way upstairs
This is a primary bedroom over here
Oh and then over here
The bathrooms
In case youve ever wanted to shower with ten people
Thats my thing man
You can take a bath with no one
And basically all yourself but showering
You can fit an army in there
If thats what youre into  He is
And now the best part of the house over at the pool
The real reason this house cost so much
Im pressing it
Is this a screen?
It is absurdly large
And slow
It gives drama though  It is Exactly
It gives a dramatic effect
Its a little bit of a flex
What a gorgeous view of LA
Yeah Imagine this screensaver was LA
I think it is
Theres downtown LA
and theres downtown LA
For reference Karl is like six foot five
Yeah something like that Give or take
And look how tall the TV is compared to him
All right Justin youve seen the whole house
We need to know
Obviously you have 100 million in cash sitting outside
Are you going to buy the house?
Nolans shirt comes with it  You dont like my shirt?
Your shirt comes with it?  Yeah
Im in Does the bear that ripped up the shirt come with it?
Wait wait  Why?
I hope you guys enjoyed it
Ill see you around
The people in this video take being lucky to the extreme
from finding a 250 million lottery ticket on the street
to winning the championship game
with a full court basketball shot
Thats extremely lucky
NASCAR crew dodges two cars
Dude I love NASCAR
Into the danger zone
Jason  Jason!
Youre in the danger zone!

Jason dont know nothing but jacking
Look at him
He jumped with a floor jack
Those things weigh like 60 pounds
Thats insane
Right so theyre riding a rollercoaster

Wait cause now he can probably look
through that guys phone and embarrass him and stuff
and thats pretty funny
Imagine falling from this  Imagine dragon
Yo they were asking for that to happen once dude
Those are blanks
Okay those are blanks
Yeah it was probably just the air
Well mm

So this is uh
Your local WWE
Did you see the guy on the side?
He was like Yo turn around
You just did the coolest thing Ive ever seen
Okay so hes jumping up
Wow  Oh!
I dont know if that was luck
That looked like skill
This is tree falling
Nice He made a new tree  Oh there we go
Okay okay Ill approve Ill approve
All right gentlemen

Number one I saw this on TikTok
Number two its proven fake
I wanna believe its real
No its on the internet
Its fake  No!
Everything on the internets fake
I just wanna believe that hes sawing
it snaps in half and that catches it
Thats so cool
I watched a long video about this
He was in a submarine  Uhhuh
It sank to the bottom it had an air pocket
It was on the bottom of the ocean
He was living in an air pocket in pitch black for four days
He felt sharks swimming around him and everything
In freezing cold water dude
And they got him out?
Yeah they got him out
Lets high five for that guy
This is a state championship game
The team in black is currently up by three points
He misses  Oh thats a miss
Thats a big miss
Okay look
Half a second is left on the clock
Wait a minute Jimmy where hes standing at
approximately would be worth three points
No chance he makes it Jimmy
Wow thats sick
This is why Im scared of baseball
I got hit in the face with a ball like that one time
Dude it literally went across his chest
Just catch it
What do you mean just catch it?
He tried  Just catch it
This is why I dont ice climb
This is like that Modern Warfare II mission
It kind of looks like he hit it
Hes only climbing with those two sheaths
And his feet have spikes on him
Thats the only other thing  Oh my God
No rope no nothing dude
If you lose your footing
its just that one thing holding you up
Mmhm  No never ice climbing
Thats in
Oh might have been an accident
Stay in your lane
Yeah its an accident  So they collided
This guys knocked out
Just blacked out
Wow  Nice
He just saved his life
All right so these workers are working on a building
Thats like a Minecraft sand trap
Look at that guy on the pole
Hes just like
This is the safest spot I know it
He bought a lottery ticket
a winning lottery ticket
but he left it at the store
And thankfully an honest cashier came to the rescue
You work at a gas station
someone buys a lottery ticket  Mmhmm
They leave it there  Mmhmm
You grab it
Next day you find out
it wins a quarter of a billion dollars
You giving it back or you keeping it?
To the bank
I would anonymously leave him a million dollars
Yeah maybe two  To be nice
Two million
But look thats on you
Finders keepers  Losers weepers
Wow  Bro come on
We do Team Trees
and this is how he pays back Mother Nature
Geez that tree said Mm its your time
Right this guys on the ladder
Oh Christmas lights
This is why I dont hang Christmas lights
Dude imagine not being alive anymore
because you were hanging Christmas lights
Oh thank gosh he had help  Wow he had a lot of help
Its like they were just waiting for it to happen
Yo if I ever fall off a roof
I better have six dudes come help me
Okay so hes driving
Getting a lot of sway going  He seems to swerve
Yeah hes noticing
Oh Lord have mercy  Hes noticing
Oh whats gonna happen?
Oh wait is it loose?
No its still connected
Its a trailer but its getting sideways
Man he handled that incredibly
Never let em know your next move
I was about to say
This clip has the title card of an inch away
And before we watch the clip
I just wanna say I dont understand
why thats in the Worlds luckiest clips
Because  That seems pretty far away
An inch is a ton of space
Some would say its almost a little too much
I mean he still hit that sign
Through that sign
Move your car now
That was a pretty cool trick in itself
Kid you are what Chris wishes he was
Hey no
What I wish I was
was that Sabrett hot dog
Cause that thing look good
The best evasive maneuver Ive ever seen
Whoa oh
Kicking drywall is so much fun
A lot went wrong so quick
But also right
Dont have to know sports to know that was sick
West Brick capitalized on the Brick
He did that was beautiful
That was very cool
Crazy ping pong saves
Oh hes only got one arm
Whoa  Whoa
Congrats to you
He didnt even react
Thats how you know hes been there before
Oh thats a giant hole right?
Am I looking at a hole?
What am I looking at?
Oh my goodness  Wow
How does the guy whos currently standing there feel safe?
Hes like Let me get closer to the edge
just so you can see it
Humans are dumb
I love people but humans are really dumb
Weve all seen this clip all right?
Hes getting interviewed
Was that fake? Did that happen?
Did that turn out fake?
I dont know its kinda hard

So far Id say these people are pretty lucky

Slab City is a community
located in the middle of the desert
It has no electricity no running water
and no law enforcement
Out of curiosity

And then once we take this turn its nothing
No buildings no nothing
So were on the outskirts of Slab City
This right here is Salvation Mountain
Its a tourist attraction

Yeah I think thats the reason
why theyre playing  Oh
So are we all dressed up
and ready to go to the party?  We are
And we were just thinking that going to this party
is the weirdest thing weve ever done
Except for the time we all sat in a circle
Or the time we were in straightjackets
in the insane asylum
What about the time we counted to a hundred thousand?
Oh that was just me  I went to Ohio
Thats pretty crazy
That old man with the beard came over here
and told us theres a party
Wait the old man told us about the party
Yeah  Oh great
Its my kind of party
We scoped it out with the drone

It was lit up  Yeah
And there was empty seats
Apparently it was a show or like a open mic
And there was lights
So yeah were going  Thats all it takes
Lights?  We like lights
Baby I cant sleep
I just signed up for the open mic here
and Im gonna try to do some stand up comedy
If Im doing bad just get the car ready
I was actually born in Saudi Arabia
Do you guys know where that is?
First memory was that all the women there dressed the same
They covered everything except their eyes
My second memory was that I kept losing my mom
in retail stores
Thank you guys so much
Thank you for letting me doing this
I appreciate it
To be honest I was not expecting this
Theres kinda like a community
and everyone here just seems super chill
They were playing a lot of music
that I really enjoy and love
I had no clue that something like this
was gonna be just randomly in the middle of the desert
For a place with no laws
this is actually pretty chill
And its kinda like a community
everyones getting along
Im just kind of surprised
in the middle of the desert you have this
Theres a lot of different people out here you know?
I honestly didnt expect this
I didnt wanna come here in the first place
but this crazy
You wanna go dance Ill donate
I cant  Lets go do it
Out in stormy weather
All right boys
Im staying here
Im gonna live here  No
Garret you wouldnt last five seconds out here
Weve been out here for 24 hours dude
Yeah you wouldnt last five more seconds out here
All right  Oh I was right
Garrets gone
What if threeknife guy comes back?
What if you literally just popped up
right behind you and grabbed you by the throat?
I mean its my time to go
and get stabbed with three rusty knife
Im sorry dude
If youre listening we dont mean this
I thought you said
you wanted to live here man
Yeah I talked to some of the locals
They denounced threeknife men
They dont like him  No they dont like him
Chris wanted to go up on stage and dance with somebody
I didnt wanna go on stage you liar
But he cant dance so he chickened out
and now were making fun of him for it
Wow Great playbyplay
Who are you? Joe Madden
Chandler you might as well just walk
into the abyss after that one
All right See you guys
Im outta here
So the boys dont understand how this works
You cant just approach to Slab City
and just be like Yo dance with me
They have to accept you
And so he was  You cant dance
You dont know if he was vibing with me or not man
You just cant dance  You cant dance
Oh God no  Stop it man
Honestly dont care if Chris can or cant dance
but I just like making fun of him
So its really funny that he didnt dance
Im gonna be honest
Chris is starting to get arrogant
cause he built the tents
It happens every time
I was told to talk about how Chris didnt dance
Haha Chris
He wont do it cause he cant dance either
Yeah I know
Thats literally what I was thinking
Why would I make fun of him when I cant dance?
So Im in the tent and Im not gonna lie
I feel exhausted
Its been a pretty fun day
Im gonna go to bed soon
All right guys its been a long day
Im pretty tired
Okay God is telling me to go to sleep
It was a crazy experience but its time for bed
So peace out
I think Im gonna hit the hay
Im not gonna lie
Im not feeling too well
Im gonna go ahead and go to bed
Ill see you guys tomorrow
I am not feeling too good
Im really sick
I think I need to go to like the doctor or something
You guys look cute spooning together though
Scoot off
Seriously Im feeling really bad
I think I might have a fever  What happened?
Well get you some meds

Chris is apparently sick even worse now
So we gotta go take him to the doctor
Yeah I get kidney stones really bad
Ive had three within like the last year
Shout out to kidney stones I guess
We picked up the campsite
Were gonna skirtskirt out
Take care of Chris
So apparently Chandler
the only thing dangerous about Slab City
is Chriss kidney stones  And threeknife man
And threeknife man
MrBeast 6000
MrBeast 6000 yeah you know his name
He changed it once or twice
But I think its here to stay
imagine living in scorching heat with no
access to food water or electricity
while constantly fearing for your safety
this is a saddening reality for the
people that live in this remote Village
in Zambia where locals are forced to
rely solely on natural resources to
survive and due to isolation from any
City and no access to light during the
nights many children are left to
navigate in complete darkness making it
extremely dangerous as there is a high
crime rate in the area this only became
evident to us 6 months ago when a woman
named Dora Muno sent us this Tik Tok
pleading for our help be philanthropy
our kids need you I immediately sent
Darren there to find out what we could
do to help Dora and her
community upon his arrival Darren
received an extremely warm welcome from
children hi Dora how are
you I came to my papa village where we
are right now in 2019 I started to
notice that some of the kids they
experienc horrible situations just
having that constant threat on your life
is terrible I felt very cold to come
back and do something so within a year
Dora packed up her life along with her
already adopted four children and moved
from luaka to mapapa to start building a
village to rescue as many children as
possible and the first thing I did was
build a mud hut and my kids and I lived
in the mud hut the kids would use my
house as classroom during the day and
then at night we would use it at a house
but when the rainy season came it got
washed away this forced Dora to turned
to Tik Tok for help the very first day I
posted I did not get any views at all it
took one song and that small video
helped me to have my first follower
which I moved from one to close to 45
million this on its own is an incredible
feed especially without any access to
electricity or reliable cell reception
as you can see theres barely any
connectivity out here well there is
actually one way every time I have to
post out here I have to hold my phone up
for close to 30 minutes depends can I
track my phone I got to download some
cat videos I dont know if its working
just a little bit longer oh can you get
a signal hold it dont move it is it
working okay good were done to hold it
like that it is she is doing all of this
solely to generate income through
donations to expand this Village weve
rescued 350 kids we provide good
education for them we provide meals for
them just for them to experience a
different lifestyle from what they know
but the cost of maintaining this school
have become increasingly expensive and
impossible to sustain meaning it wont
be long until the school will have to
close down it became evident that the
lack of electricity was holding them
back and severely curtailing Doras
ability to help develop this Village to
what its potential could be having to
wake up and thinking what will these
kids eat that is still very difficult to
do each and every day so we came up with
a plan to use the direct sunlight and
scorching heat to our advantage by
installing a massive solar grid that
will provide electricity to the entire
Village while weve worked on even more
ways to grow this Village and surprise
Dora with the team along with our
amazing Partners at give power spent the
next few months secretly building this
plant again I want to emphasize how we
would never have been able to pull this
off in time without give power after
months of planning and a lot of hard
work Im pading the last Bol in the
Solar Ray were finally
done as you can see behind me the sun is
Now setting and in a little while were
going to be turning on the lights for
the very first time and from now on the
kids will no longer experience Darkness
night the moment has finally come were
just about to turn on all the lights
Mato the electrician is waiting in the
container and Im going to radio him and
give him the go ahead M turn on the
nice and we have
yeah to witness these childrens
reaction to light such a simple
necessity was incredibly
humble oh it was a joy it was a sight to
behold and were very grateful to be
philanthropy for that but we werent
done just yet theres barely any water
in the water that they have is not
Quality Water this is one thing that
electricity just cannot solve and with
the extreme heat could be fatal as they
only have one tiny pump that lasts for
30 minutes per day and 350 kids and 84
staff have to be taken care of by this
little water and thats including the
water that they need to be able to cook
fresh food so every day I will have to
then get into my car which will either
start that day or it wont start that
day then from there if it does run
shell have to do a 2hour round trip
just to get cold water but Darren is
about to surprise door about how this is
all going to change after to Ive seen
everything that youve done here what
youre doing with these kids we decided
were also going to do a hydrological
study and were going to give you a
proper well a professional deep deep
well so that youre never going to have
to worry about water again were going
to install an electric water heater in
the kitchen a commercial gas stove and
were going to more than triple Your
Capacity in solar production okay thank
you its been a dream come true honestly
so that is amazing so thank you so much
youre teaching all of these kids to be
empowered and stand up for themselves
and youre going to change society here
cuz theyre going to grow theyre going
to raise their families this way theyre
going to spread the message that youre
teaching them youre planting seeds
because they love you as much as we do
but obviously doing more would incur a
much bigger expense so we reached out to
our longterm partner and sponsor of
this video electric ebik as always we
shot him a message saying hey we need
help funding this project we think it
will help a lot of people and as always
they responded no problem and then
proceeded to double Their donation for
this video because of electric ebikes
generosity we will be able to provide so
much more for Dora and these children so
make sure to go to their website or
click the link in description and buy
one of their electric ebikes right now
by purchasing their product you help
them make more money so they can sponsor
more videos and we can help more people
okay lets get back to the video and for
one final surprise before we left Darren
wanted to give the kids his favorite
treat this is the first time any are
going to get ice cream its a very rare
treat because it needs Refrigeration

more money so we can help more people by

and that should give me like a five to 10 minute head start
I rented an entire museum have dozens of cars
giant military equipment and so much other cool stuff
This is just the beginning
Hes heading up back up like northwest
This is where things get fun
As you see the Squid Game mask over there

Who is this guy?
Now we are in a warehouse full of jeeps
Lets just say when they pull up
theyre gonna be very confused
Do you know what to do when they get here?
Jimmy Just drive in a random direction
Right now?  No when they get here
Oh  And now we patiently wait
and monitor the security cam
Looks like hes stopped at a building
Cameraman 2 Whats the strategy? Wait is that a knife?
Yeah  Is this the spot boys?
Yeah this is the spot intense instrumental music
Weve spotted the military squad on the security cameras
All the doors on this building are locked
Lets see if they break into the warehouse

Oh so hes painting the little thing on the cross walk
I always thought that was like a thing they put on it

And he throwing it in there because he nice with it
Nice with the ice
Oh Ive seen this clip
This guy filmed the a hundred meter dash

And break everything fragile in your bag
Fast car

Change to formula one
Archery girl

Yo how do people stack cups like this?
I have a strong masculine urge to try to master this
in a under a day
Because it looks so much easier than it is
Although I know its very hard
I have a strong masculine urge to cut off
from civilization and live in the middle of nowhere
And never talk to anyone
Literally nothing to do with what I was talking about
cricket cricking
Speaking of strong masculine urges they just lifted a car
They had the strong masculine urge to take apart a vehicle
for no reason
Is this if your car gets stuck?
And thats how unstuck it?
Yeah wait
So imagine you cant get over something right?
Theres like something blocking the way
You take your car apart
Move it over the obstacle and put it back together
Thats interesting
Is that like a military thing or?

So guys now here Look gather around
Mmhmm Uhhuh
Chad get him get him get him
Mrbeast six thousand oh
Mrbeast six thousand yeah you know his name
If you ever wanna melt something
and you need to get it really hot or you wanna do casting
like our logo right here we put up on our wall
go to PMCsupplies
They helped us out They got a ton of cool stuff
And without them this video wouldnt have been possible
This school in Cameroon has
extremely dilapidated and hazardous classrooms
No running water or electricity
and only a single toilet shared by over 3000 kids
and staff daily
And whats even worse is despite the schools
mission to empower young girls
and provide them a safe haven from domestic abuse
and other challenging conditions
many children cannot enroll
because of overcrowding and deteriorating conditions
So in this video were going
to rebuild the school from this to this
this to this
and this to this
to give these kids a better opportunity at life
We started out by sending Dan and Darren
there a few months ago to see how we could help
Upon their arrival they met with Francis
an extraordinary man who has dedicated his life
to combat inequality and suffering in Cameroon
He is the founder of CDVTA
an organization that helps build wells
facilities and solar power installations and aids
The development of education throughout Cameroon
When we first visited the school
What we saw of those children
were actually on the conditions
of lack of sanitation
Some of them were abused
They had no right to raise their voice
They could not speak for themselves
These conditions would not make your child believe that
the future is bright
The kids that are in the
school are sitting in classrooms
that are literally made out of scrap wood
Ive been shooting
in one of these classrooms for 5 minutes
and my face is literally dripping with sweat
I cant imagine what it must
be like to sit in here for an hour long lesson and learn
The environment is first of all dirty
That is dust all over
We dont have ceiling boards
The state of these classrooms is tragic for many reasons
but mainly because this school is on the border
of the English and French parts of Cameroon
making it a rare junction point
between two populations in ongoing conflict
This school could help unite these communities
Many people have moved from the English part
and is settled in this area
This school became a safe place for them to come and
get educated here
But because of the poorly built
infrastructure rain leaks through the roof in winter
There is no electricity and the school was beyond
maximum capacity
So almost immediately  The team quickly
got to work to completely
transform the school and surprise the kids
before they got back from their school break
And before the kids returned from their holidays
Darren and Dan went to visit their brand new classrooms
Darren and I looked
at the new structures which have airflow
They have lights of electricity
Let there be light!
I cant wait to see the look on the kids faces
The teachers faces when they get to see
the new classrooms also the new bathrooms
The school
is going to transform thousands
and thousands of lives in the future
The next day it was finally time
to surprise the kids
Theres a whole bunch of people outside the school
This is really exciting
The school was the busiest it had ever been with kids
beyond excited to get a glimpse
of the brand new classrooms
I just got out of the car
Theres a whole bunch of people
over here to welcome me
This is a little bit crazy
The headmaster Dillon
turned to the new classrooms
where he would officially cut the ribbon
and declare the new school open
When the environment is beautiful
academics moves positively just the happiness
motivates them psychologically to study and study well
When interacting with these kids over here
I realized that these are children
that have a thirst to learn
And providing them the opportunity to realize
that is probably the best legacy
that well leave behind in this community
I cant imagine the impact this will have on the lives
of children in this school Thank you
And thank you very much indeed
Before I show you an unexpected surprise
the community had for Darren
I want to tell you about the amazing sponsor
of this video
Lectric EBikes
Theyre back on board and supporting our mission
with their affordable
eco friendly and fun to ride bikes
Time and time again
theyve shown their dedication
to a global impact by helping us
rebuild an orphanage
donating thousands of shoes
to kids in South Africa and distributing
millions of clothes worldwide
Additionally they helped us power
an island in Colombia
a childrens sanctuary in Zambia and give away
hundreds of electric bikes all across the globe
And now for the eighth time this year they stepped up
and helped us build this school in Cameroon
So I just want to give a heartfelt
thank you to Lectric EBikes
for their continuous support
Lets get back to the video
Now it is time for Darrens surprise
So the village leaders took him to a ceremonial hut
and dressed him up in local attire
He then took part in a traditional Cameroonian
induction as a village elder
Hold it now
Hold it  Yeah!
Ive just been honored as a chief in the village
Now that Darren had finally become a chief
it was time to say goodbye to Cameroon and these kids
We cant wait to come back soon to visit
By watching this video you helped us
generate some ad revenue so we can continue
to do philanthropic projects all around the world
And youve told the YouTube algorithm
you like the video
so theyll recommend it to more people
And for that we are very grateful
And if you want to continue to support
Francis and the many communities
he helps throughout Cameroon
you can donate directly to his charity
using the donate button or the link to description
All the proceeds will go to Francis and CDVTA
so they can continue to help build
a better future for these children

One of the best experiences Ive ever had
In our last video I mentioned that every single person
that buys this executive producer shirt or hoodie
will get their name at the end of this video
which is why you see names on the left side of your screen
Because that is every single person
that purchased this shirt or hoodie
And I didnt tell you guys I would do this
but on top of that
we also wrote every single one of your names
on the wall of my studio
Literally every day when I come in to film
Im gonna see your name on this wall
Like Peter Wild when I film Im gonna be reminded of you
And same with Knox and Knox Tucker and Koda
and Koda G and all these Michaels
And on top of that Chandler bring it on in
I also got all your names put on this Tesla
Thats right Not only are all your names on my studio wall

And theyre like all right run it
Lets do it tomorrow
Tomorrow run it
Now were gonna take a water balloon
and drop it from a 300foot skyscraper
Every kid has wanted to do this
This kid had the balls to do it
They say if you drop a penny
off the Empire State Building it could kill someone
So what if you drop a water balloon off it?
Lets find out
Okay good
Hes got a second angle
That sounded like a rock
Itd be so fun just to drop a thousand at the same time
On Carl as he is walking by?
And then just run away and never say we did it
I cant wait
until we get to the 10000 foot drop at the end of
this video
Thats gonna be insane in the membrane
Now were gonna take a giant rock and drop it
467 feet
Wait the wrestler Dwayne the Rock Johnson?
You can literally see it on your screen
Wait hes got so many movies hes gonna be in
Dont do it!
I refuse to play the clip until you stop
Its a funny joke
Get him out Get him outta your system
Alright all right
Jumanji Action Bald Big
I wanna see it
All right Its falling
Its falling
Oh my God  Still falling
Holy crap  Oh my gosh
Thats it Were outta here!
This guy is throwing 10000 out of an airplane
Hes making it rain
So does Honey
Honey is the number one shopping tool in America
and scours the internet for coupon codes when you check out
online to make sure you get the best deal possible
But wait a minute Jimmy
this sponsorship couldnt have come
at a better time because I wanted new roller blades
Thats convenient then
Its as easy as going to your favorite online store
adding roller blades to your cart
and then watching Honey search the internet
for coupon codes and then automatically applying them
But wait! What if Im on the go?
Im glad you asked
Honey is available on mobile too
Why am I here?
How much does it cost?
Tell me!
Shut up!
How much my ears hurt
How much?
How much?!
Nothing Honey is free to install
Thats !
So go to joinhoneycombeastreacts
Thats joinhoneycombeastreacts and install it right now
Do it!
Now we are in a helicopter dropping Legos
Whats gonna happen?
Oh a Lego red arrow
They did this solely for the thumbnail
Okay hes dropping it
Oh no you fumbled the bag so hard
Fumbled it so hard
We wont even know what its like when it hits the ground
Even hes like Oh I messed up
Imagine renting a helicopter going through all that trouble
and then you just hit it on the side
A whole days work and then just ruined instantly
Yeah that was still epic
I still give it a nine outta 10 for epic
I was gonna say eight
Now were gonna drop another car
But from 500 feet
This is different cause its higher
This doesnt look like it was like a planned thing
It looks like this guy just picked
up this car and is gonna drop it
Oh no Wait This is Top Gear
I love Top Gear so much
Im not an nerd
All right Lets see it fall
Adds enough time to cut to other people while it falls
Its still going
Boom Did that satisfy your male instinct?
Now were gonna drop a giant inflatable ball off a dam
into the YouTube employee watching
Thats a dam as in the thing that holds back water?
Oh I was gonna say
Not the bad word
If I see a yellow single on this video I will sue
Im so intrigued for whats gonna happen
Imagine he just fell off the
I was thinking the same thing cause he put a lot
of effort into that
He was willing to go all in
Imagine he falls off with it but then he
hes riding the top of it
and he bounces up and somehow survives
He bounces all the way back
up to the dam and he is like all right lets do it again
Or just bounces up and down until it stops bouncing
Hes just like all right
I love watching it
Just like
it cant really do that much
Oh no it didnt speed
I love hearing Australian people talk
Okay That angle is way
All right now were 1500 feet in the air
and this mannequins gonna get kicked outta the helicopter
Oh its MythBusters
Ladies and gentlemen this is a Mythbusters control
All right so what are we myth busting?
What happens if you fall out of a helicopter?
I think we already knew
He said it was a control though
Maybe this is just to see like the speed of how fast
a human drops
Oh he hit
He hit hard
I think its time to say it
Say it
Mannequins take a lot of flack
They do things that we dont wanna do as humans
And I think its time someone stands up for them
It better not be you because theres a shipping
container with a thousand mannequins jammed in it right now
I do own a lot of mannequins
Im no better than the rest of you
Now were gonna drop a Nokia from the sky
Now heres the thing
We all know Nokias are indestructible
Oh the old old joke that everybodys heard
a hundred thousand times
what do you think is gonna happen?
Seeing how its 1500 feet in the air?
I do think its gonna break
If this still works?
What if it breaks the ground?
Where is it?
What if just goes through Earth?
Did they lose?
Whoa my theyre all laughing
But anyone could have been just destroyed by that
Decked in the head
Yeah No it doesnt work
And now the moment weve all been waiting for
A Toyota!
Were gonna go to the highest of the highest heights
higher than everything dropped in this video
And what are we gonna drop Jimmy?
A Toyota The most durable
Of course
Oh well the cars falling
Look at it It kind of survived it
Look its drivable
Go ahead and crank her up
And now the final clip an iPad is about to fall
30000 feet
30000 feet?
How did they get it up there?
Weather balloon
Whether or not I asked is the real question
You did
This is the highest thing dropped in this video
Now shes tumbling
Look at her go!
That smacked the ground
In a previous video we said wed shout out
someone random that subscribed
Heres that person
Packer Anderson!
I hope that satisfied your alpha instinct
That was things falling from high places
Subscribe if youre not  Sigma
Im going to spend the next
seven days buried alive under 20000 pounds of dirt
This is the scariest thing I have ever done
All right well I guess its time bury me alive
That was scary
This is going to be terrifying
This is pretty much most peoples worst fear
Oh my God That dirt is terrifying
Brace yourself Ha ha ha
Drop the payload
I feel like I need to hold the roof
My roof is shaking
Im entrusting my life to this coffin for the next seven days
Lets pray it doesnt just randomly decide to break
And obviously this goes without saying
But yes this is 100 real
And Ill be honest
I severely underestimated how hard this was going to be
And with that the challenge has officially started
I am now trapped in here for the next seven days
It took the boys so long to bury me alive that I already have to pee
And the challenge just started
In case youre wondering how I use the bathroom down here
Well yeah
This is so uncomfortable
All I have to survive the next seven days
My foot!
is the food in this briefcase
which is basically just some MREs and snacks
My foot went numb
Five gallon drum of water over there
And whatever essentials the boys put in this briefcase
which probably means Im going to run out of food way
before the seven day mark
In all seriousness
This is extremely dangerous
And so I dont suffocate
I need to make sure people are watching me at all times
Jimmy can you hear this?
Yeah it sounds like Nolans mom is jumping on the surface
If we had 12 people maybe it would be that
Its almost 1 am
I have a feeling a lot of you are going to start going to bed
I need someone to be near a walkie at all times
So if I need something I actually need one of you to answer okay?
And now that I have nothing better to do
Im going to head to bed and Im either going to wake up
well rested or crushed by 20000 pounds of dirt
Hopefully I wake up wellrested
Sleep is going to be key to finishing this challenge
because when Im asleep
Im not thinking about the fact that Im trapped in this box
But that only works most of the time
Is there a fly in here?
The goal is to sleep as much through this challenge as possible
For my own sanity
Oh look at him
He looks so cozy
Jimmy Jam!
Nolan drew all over your face
Nolan how many hours till your mom comes to set?
No I know youre going to say something
Hopefully she doesnt actually crush the coffin
Show him
My strategy during this video was to sleep the entire time
I completely forgot though
My friends are going to annoy me and not let me sleep
This is going to be miserable
I want to start today off by turning these long pants into shorts
I just punched that box
Mission one complete Your boy has shorts
This is our food briefcase
Lets give this MRE a try
MRE stands for Meal Ready to Eat
All you have to do is add hot water and it chemically cooks the food
The boys on the other hand were grilling up
steaks and literally feasting on top of my grave
You know Jimmy just for you
were going to eat MREs for the rest of the time were out here
Really?  Yeah
I literally heard Tareq in the background saying no
Enjoy your hot water pasta in a bag
Meanwhile this is my reality
Oh its crunchy
Why is pasta crunchy?
This is This is great
I was so bored I actually ended up punching my coffin for fun
until my knuckles started to hurt
So I put a sock on my hand so I could keep punching the wall
Im desperate for entertainment
Oh Jimmy
Thank God Im so bored
One second
What did you do?
Yo that actually scared me
Can you at least semi explain to me what youre doing?
Seeing how my life is on the line?
Unfortunately the boys are incapable of explaining anything
What theyve done is theyve stuck a pipe
all the way down to my grave vacuumed the dirt out of it
just to take this surgical wire camera
and feed it down and look at me suffer
Yeah thats what happens
Thats what happens
Its time to go in
This is so surgical
Oh that fly on my leg freaked me out
Get away from me
You want to hold this steady?
Just keep looking
Move your  We see him
Good night Jimmy
And when day two was coming to a close
the boys left me to go spend time by their RV
And being the under stimulated man I was
I thought itd be a good time to crack into their essentials briefcase
and see what was inside
Wait hes opening the card
Is this Nolans mom?
I found a photo of your mom
Did you do that?  No that was not me
Nolan is this your mom?
Oh my God Shes on his chest
Besides somehow losing this picture if I had to
guess what I think would make me quit this challenge
it would be not wanting to poop underground
Back pain back pain back pain
And maybe some back pain
And obviously you can tell
this is already getting pretty hard for me
But like usual you better bet its going to get a whole lot worse
Its raining really heavy right now
I just woke up to the sound of thunder Nolan wake up
We got to check on Jimmy make sure hes like not crushed
Im actually kind of concerned
This looks way more funeralesque
You think that dirts heavier now?
Dirt plus rain is heavy
I think I have an idea of how to wake him up
Is someone drilling?
Its one of those days
I dont even have my pants on yet
And things are already getting crazy
Jimmy can you hear us?
What are you doing up there?
There are currently 15 speakers on top of your grave
So if I had to guess Kris is about to play stupid music
Jimmy its a party up here
Yo my coffins actually shaking
Jimmy theres an earthquake oh my God
Wait what is that?
I just noticed theres an unscrewed bolt
on the side of my coffin
His screws came loose in the coffin
From the base?
Are you kidding?  Literally from the base
Should I be concerned this wasnt screwed all the way in
Max it out
What the heck are you doing right now?
Im vibrating
These vibrations are kind of hurting my head
Why is there flowers in my hair? Im freaking out
Okay lets go dig a tunnel
Were going to start the tunnel right here
and dig all the way into Jimmys coffin
We have the speakers blaring noise so that he doesnt hear us digging
Ive got an idea
Well play construction noises over the speakers
So that way he doesnt hear the excavator
Theres a loud noise and no ones answering over the walkie
So either Im about to die
Its like playing a video game
Or theyre about to do something dumb
Except for you could accidentally kill somebody
Ive officially crossed the 50 hour mark
I have now been buried longer than I was last time I did this challenge
I promised my doctor
that I would move every day so I dont get blood clots
cause apparently lay down for seven days straight can kill you
Im digging a hole
We got to loosen up the dirt for Kris
I asked the boys to pack dumbbells and they gave me 3 pound dumbbells
I smell so bad
Yeah Im going to do my best not to think about the fact
that I could die
when I stand up and a couple of days
Kris go a few feet deeper
Im not certified to do this at all
I am bored in a coffin
We definitely stayed up all night
and dug this tunnel and didnt pay that guy to do it
Is this safe?
Im going second  Whats that?
And then you bring up the rear Tareq
You guys come right behind me
One of the weird parts about this challenge
is theres so many cameras always reporting at all times
We should dig a couple more inches and then were to the coffin
It didnt really bother me the first few days
but I just have this weird feeling
someones always staring at me and its starting to like kind of
irritate me
Oh there he is there he is
We almost got him  What is that sound I hear?
Hi Jimmy!  Jimmy!
Hey Jimmy do you see us?
I see Nolans forehead
Yeah its hard to miss
How long did it take to dig that tunnel?
Literally all night Jimmy
This is not what I was expecting to happen today
Hey Nolan one second What do you think of that photo?
What do I have to do to get rid of that picture of my mom?
This is the only thing keeping me sane
How do I get it back?  Im framing this and keeping it forever
Youve been in this coffin for so long
that you forgot about what happened to the channel
Were almost at 200 million
Youre going to hit 200 million subscribers in that coffin
Wish I could see it live
Me too my friend
Nolan has a surprise for you as well
Were going to tape this Feastables bar to Jimmy
Oh my God its hot down here
Is that the new Feastables bar?
Hey this is actually pretty good marketing by my friends
now in every timelapse Feastables will be there
I hope tomorrows easier
Its a weird feeling I am very tired but for some reason I cant sleep
I dont know Ive never had this happen before
Why am I crying?
Its officially day five
Only two more days in this nightmare
I dont think humans are meant to lay down for five days straight
Ill try to act like Im not depressed
Almost there!
Jimmy we got paintball guns and were going to shoot your tombstone
That sounds fun Can I join?
I dont even know what to say to them
Jimmy what have you been doing for fun?
Nothing Im in mental agony
Have you pooped yet?
I have to poop really badly but Im going to see
if I can hold it in for the next two days
I dont know why but I have like no motivation to do anything
Ive been laying here for five days and I dont even have enough energy
to prepare a meal
because going to the bathroom down here is so difficult
Dont ask me how but I accidentally got some pee on my shorts
Im cutting off the part of my shorts that are infected
Sorry for how short they are now
That was disgusting
Jimmy were here to celebrate
Were almost at 200 million subs
Well whats the estimate of when we hit it? How long?
Im not a rocket scientist
What does he want from us?
Ive been feeling pretty terrible all day
for the fact that were about to hit 200 million subscribers
Actually makes me kind of happy
You know since were about to hit 200 million subscribers
this would be a super convenient time to talk
about Verizon home Internet
Thats a good point
Verizon 5G home Internet is exactly what it sounds like
Its wireless Internet for your home that runs off
Verizons extremely fast 5G ultra wideband network
And dont ask me how but the gang hacked it
to make sure it worked while Im underground
Were turning it on now
Okay Im connected
And now youre going to watch us hit 200 million
And just by plugging in this little box
thanks to Verizon I now have reliable
5G home Internet
And because of our hack
It actually works Even though Im ten feet underground
I can see my real time subscriber count
Karl did you know that if the people watching this video are over 18
while supplies last when they order Verizon home internet
Verizon will give you an Xbox series S on them
They must hate money
I mean honestly Yeah
And you can get it for as low as 35 a month
So if you want a fast  and reliable internet
just go to mrbeastverizoncom and put in your address
and itll tell you if its available in your area
And now lets focus on the 200 million subscriber goal
We are so close
Before this I was just some random dude in Nebraska and
Now hes just some random dude to North Carolina
I used to be just a random guy in Nebraska
Karl this is a heartfelt moment Dont copy Nolan
Its crazy that we used to like talk about this
sitting at a lunch table and now were at 200 million subscribers
I just want to say its been an honor working with everyone
Lets crush some more goals
And finally Chandler close this off
I first started working here it was like seven of us
and I was the janitor
and now were at 200 million subs and Im very grateful
I started making videos when I was 11
Im 25 now and I never in a million years
thought the channel would get this big
I mean as were about to hit 200 million subscribers
I just want all of you to know that I appreciate
every single one of you to watch my videos
I still remember the days when I would make videos
and literally get zero views Thank you so much
Were going to see all these numbers move
Oh my God!  We did it
Lets go!  Yeah!
We did it!
Oh I think its unfortunately time that we unplug you know
Wait hold on
I havent even got a chance to call my girlfriend yet
Yeah we got you We got you for sure
All right bro were going to be right here
Okay? You just finish that call
Oh come on plug it back in
I just want to say like just 2 minutes
So my girlfriend knows Im alive
Lets go eat  All right
Im doing this thing where Im crying
and Im not 100 sure why Im crying
Hitting 200 million with the boys was fun
but now Im just alone and trapped in here again
Its been five days
Five days alone in this coffin
I honestly have no idea how Im going to survive
two more days of this
Im going downhill quickly
Yo Jimmy how you doing?
Oh no response
I dont know if hes alive
Nolan I appreciate you checking in on me and caring but
Are you actually hanging in there?
Jimmy went from being terrified
to an absolute yapster and now hes a sad boy
Im doing my best to talk to you guys for content but
to be honest I have like zero desire to speak
I just want to get out of here
Yeah hes losing his mind
I think we need to find a way to cheer him up
So Im going to make some phone calls
I dont know if Ive told you guys this
but Ive already used up all my pee
bottles and so basically whenever I have to pee
I eat one of these meals and then I just pee in this bag
and zip it up
I know that might be too much information
This challenge is disgusting and I want to leave
I was so down bad that there was only one thing
in this world that could possibly cheer me up
Jimmy I brought somebody
Whod you bring?
My parents
Well have you talked about Nolans mom at all since youve been down there?
No not whatsoever
And the picture?
I dont know what youre talking about
More importantly do you guys have something super embarrassing
you could tell us about Nolan?
Jimmy theres so many
That will instantly make this challenge so much better
He told us he was going to prom but he actually just
went to the neighbors next door for a little bit
We like to see him bring a girl home for Christmas
Thats all I needed to cheer me up
because I know the comment section is going to go crazy
I hate Jimmy
My mom has one more question
Hit me
All right now you walk away Thats how it works
Did he throw the walkie again?
I know all of you like to sleep in and you dont like getting up early
I dont care
In exactly 12 hours I need you all to start digging
Thats kind of early right?
What time is it?
As long as we wake up for our alarms well be good
What would you do if when I stand up
I get blood clots and just die on the spot?
Id know where to put you
See you in 12 hours
Its a date
Im about to go to bed
and hopefully when I open
these eyes in the morning someone is digging me out of this coffin
So I dont know why Im tearing up
I dont think Ive ever been more excited for anything
in my entire life
I cant wait to see the sunlight tomorrow
Ill see you guys in the morning
Laying down for my final night
All I can think about is whether or not
Id be able to stand when this is over
Its not normal to be laying down and not moving this long
It is officially been seven days
I know you guys dont like doing manual labor but can you dig me up?
Were getting you out Jimmy
This is the worst part of the challenge
Because Im just waiting for my stupid friends to dig me up
And of course theres the added tension
of whether or not Im going to die when I stand up
So yeah
Bring in the excavator
I bet you when I get out the first thing theyre going to say is how bad I smell
this Santa Claus looking guy is going to bring you out now
Karl I dont care what he looks like
Just get me out of this coffin
Dig dig dig dig
Any second now this dirt above me will turn into sunlight
Oh thats the excavator
Oh thats scary
I can see sunlight
Jimmy!  Jimmy!
Its hard to describe what the sun looks like after
not seeing it for seven days straight
I started crying once again
Im not sure why I just couldnt help it
The only question that remains
now is when I stand up am I going to die of blood clots?
Well find out in just a minute
Jimmy you ready?
Dont drop it on me
I bet it stinks in there
You guys are predictable
I said thats what you would say
Well lets not celebrate
until I stand up and dont die of blood clots
At least sit up for a second
But wait wait wait wait wait wait
Wait for a medic to come down
Do you feel nauseous at all? dizzy?
Oh I dont know
Thats good enough for me come on up Jimmy
This is my first time standing in a week
Oh my God My legs are weak
Oh I didnt die  Yeah! Time to go
All good!
I do feel like a rush of blood to my head though
Its is actually a crazy feeling but the real surprise
was waiting for me just above ground
Oh wow theres so many people
After seven days
I was finally able to celebrate 200 million subscribers the right way
We have to celebrate 200 million bro
Now that you all saw my underwear Im going to end the video
And as always lets end with an explosion
This is one of the dirtiest beaches in the entire world
And were gonna pick up every single piece of trash
on this beach
Starting with this water bottle
One out of millions of pieces of trash
This will take forever
upbeat island music
Bottle me up baby
Im hungry for your plastic
As you can see this is taking forever
Oscar come on in
This is Oscar professional beach cleaner
Is this basically how you guys clean beaches?
Mainly we do the big stuff first
and then we bring a lot of people with sifters as well
for the small stuff
You scoop it into this thing
and then shake out the sand
and you got a bunch of trash
This right here is the first bag of trash
Hundreds more to go How do we do this quicker?
We just need more people
That seems simple Can you clap for me?
Oscar clapping
There you go! All the volunteers
Okay guys were gonna clean this up using the vice
Were gonna clean this up Groups of four!
Groups of four in this area
Part of me wanted to see if me and the boys
could clean up this beach by ourselves
and the other part of me realizes
that wouldve taken a year
I couldve told you that
Jimmy Yeah?
The oceans putting more trash on the beach
Theres so much underwear in the ocean
Im enacting a new law
Thou shall not throw your underwear in the ocean
Wait did you guys already fill up a bag?
You guys are better than us
They are professionals to be fair
After 12 hours of cleanup
this is what we managed to achieve which isnt enough
Boys bring it in
Tomorrow Im gonna bring in 10 times the volunteers
record scratching
flipflop squeaks
Its now the next day
crowd cheers
Im helping
But as slowly as possible
Whos more bueno? Mark Rober or MrBeast?
piano music
Make sure you watch until the end of the video
to find out how were gonna pick up
30 million pounds of trash
Thank you for coming to our country
and help us with this initiative
That is really awesome
Right here Right there
Stop Hes not stopping
Im gonna move
In this bad boy is 6000 pounds of trash
And now we have 36000 pounds of trash
which weighs the same as 3000 cats or three Trexes
Whichever you prefer
While I was talking with some of the locals
they mentioned that theres a beach down the street
that was also very dirty
So I said Nolan with a bunch of volunteers
to go clean that beach as well
Theres a whole car bumper right here
Theres a car bumper here? Did this come outta the ocean?
People litter weird things
What type of trash have you seen along the beach?
Most importantly most commonly is plastics
And we see that in every form on the beach here
They ended up removing 12000 pounds of trash
which brought us up to a total
of 50000 pounds of trash from just two beaches
Check out this power move Watch this
Look at that!
Is that how you want us to dump it?
Yeah dude Im taking one for the team
Im a team player
Oh yeah I dont even have to look
There you go Mark
It actually kind of works
And if you guys look over there
were actually getting close to the end of the beach
This is what the beach looked
like at the start of the video
And this is what it looks like with like 20 left
Were getting there
Were doing it!
Unfortunately between the ocean washing up trash
to the beach and rivers bringing in new trash from
the mainland obviously this beach is gonna get dirty again
But with your guys help we can stop a much bigger issue
Were almost done Jimmy
I know! Four straight days of picking up trash
And just like that we removed over 60000 pounds of trash
from the worlds dirtiest beach
And even though this 60000 pounds of trash we picked up
might seem impressive
there is sadly way too much trash still in the ocean
Two years ago we crushed our goals with Team Trees
and planted 20 million trees
And now its time to do it again
Which is why we along with hundreds of other creators
are launching Team Seas
And for every 1 you guys donate like this
one less pound of trash will be in the ocean
But what if I wanted to donate 10 Jimmy?
I conveniently have 10 pounds of trash right here
that is now out of the ocean
Boom Gone
You get the point
One dollar donated as one less pound of trash in the ocean
And Id like to personally thank YouTube Originals
for supporting Team Seas and helping us fund it
Theyre gonna be matching the first 400000
worth of donations dollar for dollar
And we wanna remove 30 million pounds
of trash from the ocean
Which is just so freaking audacious
This only happens if we all work together
Half the money we raise is going towards
funding volunteer beach cleanups like we did here today
all across the world as well as literally
fishing trash out of the ocean
And the other half will be used for these
trasheating robots that pick up trash 24 hours a day
365 days a year from rivers that flow to the ocean
Go to teamseasorg or click the donate button
below this video right now
1 equals one less pound of trash in the ocean
Making real change like this isnt gonna be easy
Go donate right now and help us remove 30 million pounds
of trash from the ocean before the end of the year
Lets show the world that we want a clean ocean
soulful music
Get outta here Go donate bell dinging multiple times
these are the lowest chance things to
ever happen in the world like this guy
who found himself randomly on Google
Maps or this persons car thats about
to get crushed by a massive Boulder but
randomly stopped but first we need to
react to this crazy ax throw okay so
theyre throwing the axes whoa okay oh
thats pretty cool we need to go try to
recreate that how can you even cut metal
what are the odds very low because
thats the whole point of the video wait

I dont believe he doesnt even have an
emotional reaction he didnt believe
that just happened wait what is he doing
oh oh the Boulders still going oh
but Boulders coming at your car dont

pretty amazing and so are you for
watching to the end subscribe
So I saw this video in my suggested
It was about UltraEver Dry
which is apparently as good at repelling water
as I am women
Look at how water just runs off this paper
and how this tissue
which I remind you should be absorbing the water
is instead playing God
Instantly a million questions flood in my mind
Like what happens if you put this
on a boat and put the boat in water?
Or can I put this on my feet and walk on water?
These were just things I needed to know
So I went to Amazon and I bought a couple gallons
of this stuff and this was the result
So like any logical person
the first question I needed answered was
if I spray this stuff on my underwear
can I just pee in them all the time and it stay dry?
Chris some of my pees still on the underwear
Youve got some pretty thick pee
Hey it never happened
Yeah I dont think we sprayed both sides
Next I wanted to test a clip
EverDry had in their video
This shirt is covered in EverDry
This designer Supreme shirt isnt
Wait no they only did the front of his shirt
Not the back
Im super disgusting
I have grass in me
Why do I have grass in me?
You can see a clear difference
This is the front
So its got the water drops on but theyll come off
And then this is the back
Look at my tie though
My ties spot on here
Well just dunk the whole tie
That actually is pretty cool
Splash back cause I think my mouth was open
Paper towel covered iEverDry versus ketchup
Its not working like it did in the video
I dont know what demonic crap theyre doing
but my ever drive must be broke
Now if you guys have ever used a paper towel before
now if you guys have ever used to pay for towel before
not quite sure why I thought some
of you have never used a paper towel before
Of course theyve fucking used a paper towel before
You know it absorbs water
Look at this
Its not absorbing water
You can throw it
This is a roll of paper towels
Wow its actually not really that wet
Waterproofing my underwear worked so well that when I pee
in the middle of the night it just runs up my bedsheets
So of course now we have to waterproof my bedsheets
In this clip we covered a cotton ball and EverDry
and I think Chris summed it up perfectly
That ones pretty cool
We then took a bagel which oddly enough
looks like a butthole and waterproofed it
I feel like a bagel
would be kind of waterproof anyway
Afterwards we waterproof a wallet
and I just realized leather is waterproof
so that was unnecessary
Chris youre fired
I wanna dump this cinder block in this water
but its really heavy
You rang?
Yeah that was my viking call
Hey can you dip this in the water tank for me?
Its like its really heavy but youre like a big boy
Now we lift it out
And look thats the part with EverDry
Thats the part without it
Hm  All right Mr Viking
you can go
Okay  Remember guys
if you ever need a Viking just go
Then we waterproofed my merch because apparently
I havent plugged it in the last five videos and yeah
not plugging your merch equals no sales
Yeah thats been pretty rough
Did you miss?
Hey it worked
Thats where the EverDry is and look at it
just running down and not sticking like it is
Holy crap the EverDry comes all the way back here
Jake you got it on as Yeezys
No did I really?  Yeah
This is like the fifth time youve hit me with an egg
Keep going oh my God
I dont think the EverDrys working
on the side of the van
Here let me try
The EverDrys over there  Oh its where?
Its in the back of the van  Oh okay
Ah crap I missed again
See right there?  Oh
Its not right there  Okay
Its not right there  Okay okay
Its more like right there  Gotcha
And you were throwing like right there
Gotcha gotcha
So I shouldnt be throwing right there
Be throwing right here right?
Ah crap I got my pants wet
Here chris can you give me that towel?
You should have waterproofed your pants man
This towels waterproof
How am I supposed to clean my pants
but when the towels waterproof?
It doesnt do anything
Look water just bounces off
Well I guess my pants will forever be wet
cause every towel here is waterproof
I dont think your hands waterproof either
Your hand got more wet than the towel
Oh yeah look at that
Nonwaterproof look at that crappy hand
Theres nothing good about this hand at all
In that clip we were talking about Chriss hand
which clearly meant we were about to start talking
about him moisturizing
And now Im sitting here listening
to two grown men talking about Chris moisturizing
And Im just wondering where I went wrong with life
So in EverDrys official video
they did this thing where they outlined their logo
in EverDry and then shot paint at it
and it looked really cool
So I thought Id redo it
in my office by spelling out shop MrBeast on the wall
Hey look it worked  No Chris it didnt work
Not quite sure what the fuck youre looking at
We then made the big mistake of giving two man childs paint
and a hot dog
Flying wiener
Stop playing Fortnite
We have to make videos
Dude every YouTuber makes Fortnite videos
Just gimme a couple months to get good
and well be fine way easier
Way easier than what we currently do
Im sick of it dude
You know what?  I just wanna
be like every YouTuber
Yeah I knew you would do that
Thats why I waterproofed my keyboard
Its still like pretty  up
Well darn I guess I cant play anymore Fortnite
Now we have to go
All right I guess Ill make videos
I know a lot of you guys out there are atheists
and for all of you atheists please explain this
This is how a paper normally reacts
when its hit with water
Pretty stereotypical
Now watch this
If its a piece of paper
with PewDiePie on it look how it reacts
It just bounces right off of him
So atheist out there explain that
Hm  Explain it!
Its like it never happened
This is how a burrito normally reacts to water
As you can see its just yeah
See this is a terrible burrito
This is how a Chipotle burrito reacts to water
Its kind of the same
We waterproofed this right guys?
Why does waterproofing not work on burritos?
Now we have burrito on the floor
Theres so much rice everywhere
They ask you how you are
and you just have to say that youre fine
And youre not really fine but you just cant get
into it because they would never understand
A lot of you guys are really young
So heres a recommendation
for all you parents watching with your young kids
See instead of changing their diapers all the time
just waterproof them and you can just use
the same diaper forever
Chris my work gloves are kind of dry
will you moisturize them for me?
Im a moisturizing expert
Yeah?  Here we go
Okay all right  There you go
Chris the moisture it just falls off
It appears my gloves are waterproof
which means theyre moisture proof
Moisturize the stress away
Give it to me boss  Here
My gloves are still waterproof
My hands are covered in moisturizer
But mine arent  Im super moisturized
But Im not oh
All right that was dumb
We then proceeded to torture Alexa by dipping her
in water as punishment for not reordering my wet wipes
Yeah all right lets see how long it stays on
Wait Alexas waterproof?  No
This is not a good idea
Thats pretty cool
Alexa dont give up
Theres a reason Jeff Bezos
is the richest man in the world
Yeah  Google Home
on the other hand was listening to a conversation
I had one time in my living room
and now Im on the FBI watch list
So take this Google Home
So this one literally will not come on
If we unplug it plug this back in watch it wait for it
Up next we have a metaphor for you guys
These boots are the Beast Gang Paulers
And this water is the haters
The haters they just brushed right off
The haters cant touch us Beast Gang Paulers
We just dab all over em
Were the strongest most litest family on the internet
We look at that
The haters are trying to touch us bullock
Even when the haters pile up we just do that
Boom theyre gone
Those boots really dont
like Mountain Dew do they?
While we have this sacrifice going
I think its time we replace our memes
Lets replace our memes
Hiro  Lets burn
our old memes
Donating to attractive Twitch streamers
Its saying I was milking it
Am I gonna die?
Memes are fun to burn
Oh  Yeah
Our second meme that must be burnt is PewDiePie
It says meme review in Japanese
Be gone PewDiePie
Its smokey in here
I know is our fire alarm gonna oh wait
we dont have one
We disabled our fire alarm
cause we do so many indoor videos
Record it  Our next meme is
is this good content?
We all know its good content
Lets put the fire right on PewDiePies face
Adding nt a word doesnt make it funny
PewDiePie reviewed it which means now the memes dead
So this one really has to burn
Trying not to breathe and die
See look guys this tissue is waterproof
Were gonna use the waterproof tissue to put out the fire
Oh take that fire
Okay hand it to me
Sorry Im not trying to die
Well this went from a normal video
to lets burn stuff indoors and yeah
The moment youve all been waiting for
We put water repellent on the bottom
of these Dundee flip flops
Millions of years of evolution have led us to this
Will water repellent on my feet allow me to walk on water?
Maybe you should walk out a little further
Maybe it just needs to take  Maybe yeah
Oh God Im losing my foot
Whered it go?
Okay all right
Well I lost my flip flop
Oh I lost that one
Well Im just gonna walk in defeat
Ha ha da feet
