This is not being followed This poses a danger to the lives of the people sitting behind as well as my life
And when I go home it becomes a danger for my family as well
This extremely important document that I am writing and handing in
Greetings friends!
It has been more than 10 days since the youtuber Flying Beast
that is Gaurav Taneja raised some critical flight safety issues in Air Asia Airlines on his social media
Due to which he was even suspended from his job as a pilot
But even today there has been no response from the airline regarding these specific issues
Whether these issues persist or not and what the airline is doing to avoid them nothing at all!
This is something that concerns all of us
If we book a flight on Air Asia today a question arises Is our safety in danger?
Come let us understand these issues in detail
I spoke to Gaurav about these issues
One of these issues is so critical that it might be the reason behind the rising cases of corona virus in the country
Come let us see
Gaurav  coming straight to the point the people that you are up against will try their best to divert the issue
But I would like to keep this to the point
Let us talk about the three safety issues that concern the people
The first safety issue as you had pointed out was that of paid leave
Could you please elaborate on that?
This issue is precisely about sick leave and how it has been made punitive
If a pilot is sick then how is he punished for taking a sick leave
In most jobs you work for five days from Monday to Friday and Saturdays and Sundays are off
For pilots they pilot the flight for 6 days and get the seventh day off
These are the off days
On the other hand there are sick leaves
No matter which job you have you can take a sick leave if you are unwell
and there are a specified number of sick leaves in every job per year for example around 1015
The same goes for the pilots
Now Gaurav says that if you take a sick leave in Air Asia then it is counted as an off day
This is a normal month with the dates written Assume a pilot had flights from the 4th until the 9th
He flies for 6 days
He should get an off on the seventh day as per the regulations
So he got an off on the 10th
And then he can work again for 6 days
Let me explain with the help of an example Suppose the pilot got sick on 9th right before his off day
and he got so sick that he was not in the condition to go to work
If he takes a sick leave on the 9th then he would have a flight scheduled on 10th despite it being an off day
and the company would assume that 9th was your off day and that you were resting
So counting six days from the 10th it can make you fly again until the 15th
A very important thing to understand here is that
Are you taking a holiday when you are sick?
Are you enjoying?
On my off days I do gym I shoot my videos and edit them and I spend time with my family
Basically it is a time to let go off my fatigue
But when you are running high fever are you recovering from fatigue?
You are suffering in your sickness
You are not recovering from fatigue
The company assumes that you are recovering
When in fact sickness adds on to your fatigue
Now assume that when that pilot came to fly on the 15th
then he had no time to recover from his fatigue from the 4th until the 15th
Imagine how fatigued the pilot will be on the last day if he is flying on 15th
Imagine if he has to get up at 3 in the morning to report for a flight and do four sectors
Furthermore if its a normal job and yourre a little fatigued then its fine it can be endured
But if a pilot flies a plane for 15 days in a state of fatigue
then it becomes a safety risk for all the passengers on board that plane
if he is unable to fly the plane properly
And here Id like to show you a study by the FAA the Federal Aviation Administration which is
the regulatory body in the US akin to the DGCA here
It was quite a significant study
The first page on it reads Fatigue threatens aviation safety because it increases the risk of pilot error
that could lead to an accident
Let me give you some background information regarding the second issue
If youve ever seen outside the window of your aeroplane while landing
then you might have observed that the portion beneath the wings starts to tilt
This part is called a flap
You can control several aspects of landing by determining how open or how closed the flap is
If the flaps are open all the way then it is called a full flap position
If theyre not open all the way theres a position in between the flap 3 position
Using the flaps you can control two main aspects of landing
The first is you can control your descent angle if your speed is constant
In the full flap position the descent angle is more steep that is the plane lands in this manner
In the half flap position that is the flap 3 position  the plane lands in this manner
You can clearly see this in the diagram
But another very important point which happens in the commercial airlines is that
If your descent angle is constant then you can control the speed of the aeroplane by using flaps
In the full flap position the aeroplane would descend slowly
You would have more time and more control over the aeroplane because of the slow descent
In the half flap positionflap three position
the speed of the aeroplane would be slightly more during the descent
Both Flap 3 and Flap Full are recommended configurations for landing
by the operatormanufacturer which is the Airbus
Both are safe But the pilot needs to evaluate the conditions for both before he makes a landing
The fact of the matter is that a Flap 3 landing saves fuel
It saves fuel because youre not landing the plane at a steep angle and bringing it down gradually
and all the airlines recommend it
But there are some conditions that call for a full flap landing for example in case of a short runway
or if there are mountains around the runway in a hilly region
then there is not enough space for the plane to descend gradually
In such cases a steep descent is required with full flap landings
Now Gaurav says that Air Asia forces its pilots to ensure that 98 of their landings are flap 3 landings
if they want a bonus
So pressure is mounted on them subconsciously to encourage them to opt for Flap 3 landings
If the pilots do not do this they would lose out on their bonus
which is a risk for the safety of the passengers in the airports where a Flap 3 landing would not be the right choice
We got an email from the company that we should opt for Flap 3 landings 98 of the times
I had received a specific email in the month of May
that in the month of March 71 of my landings were Flap 3
which is a noncompliance of SOP
Everything in aviation runs via these Standard Operating Procedures
If any pilot deviates from this then he becomes liable for an enquiry or questioning by the company
So I first got this email in March and a follow up on 31st of May2020
where my head of operations told me in writtenin black and white that
this is a punitive policy and that I as a pilot am indulging in non compliance of SOP
and this SOP is approved by the DGCA
and that the company would be happy to retrain me as I was not following the SOP
and in order to make this more punitive my bonus would be deducted as well
Could you show proof for our viewers? Any document of Air Asia with their policy written down
which reads that one needs 98 flap landings to secure a bonus?
So I have an email Dhruv which is was sent by Head of operations Captain Manish Uppal
It is dated 17th January 2020
Before I show you this email let me tell you what is a green operating procedure
Airbus provides some operating cost saving techniques
and Flap 3 landing comes under green operating procedures as well
So this heading is Flap 3 landing and idle reverse SOP non compliance
and it clearly states that if you do not do this then it amounts to non compliance of SOP
that your compliance rate for green operating procedure will improve after this email
and we wont have to apply demerits for the non compliance of SOP
What are these demerits? Everybodys points are collected at the end of the year
and the ones with more points get more bonus
and those with lesser points get lesser bonus
So if you make lesser Flap 3 landings then fewer points would be accumulated
and you would get lesser bonus at the end of the year
So Dhruv I am sending you one more email which shows that the pilots have a target of 98
The heading of this email is Non compliance to SOP and Fuel Efficiency Procedures
I received this mail from the management on the 4th of May
Our Key Performance Index KPI takes into account all scenarios
be it the environmental conditions or steep approach or tail wind or wet runway or pilot fatigue
The KPI has been formulated keeping all things into consideratio
and is on par with other AOCs in our group and other Leading world Airlines
Based on our data for the month of your compliance for reduced flap landings was 71 versus
target KPI of 98
I have a question Is this the case with only Air Asia or the other airlines as well?
As far as my experience goes there was no number given to the pilots where I worked before
Now I will tell you how this affects flight safety
The report of the investigation of the Air India crash in Mangalore in 2010
recommended that this could be a contributing factor
that their pilots were repeatedly counselled for hard landings
Boeing states that if the impact is lesser than 21G while landing then you do not require counselling
But their pilots were counselled even if they had a landing impact of 19G
So they probably felt that hard landings could invite counselling
So in order to smoothen their landing they were floating over the runway
and they used another 500800 feet of extra runway
There were several other problems in the approach
But in this specific problem they used up another very useful portion of the runway which was about 500800 feet
So all these things keep accumulating at the back of the mind
And one day when all the things keep going wrong everything will align
and then that leads to an accident
Another thing Dhruv Ever since this issue has been raised the pilots of some other companies
some people develop a macho attitude
So someone sent a post on social media which was very disturbing for me
Some people are saying that they would stick to the 98 even in Imphal
So this type of an attitude which only few pilots have
has become into a this vs this issue
It has not been made into an ego issue which is very dangerous
Now imagine
that pilot is committing to landing in an airport like Imphal which has a steep glide slope
without even considering the environmental conditions on that day
without considering anything
theyre saying that no matter when they go to Imphal theyd opt for a Flap 3 landing
Now imagine a heavy aircraft Imagine tail winds at Imphal
Imagine that its raining and its a bad weather day and the runway is wet
The drainage conditions in Indian airport and the grooving specifications
I will not go into too much detail about that
Imagine all the environmental conditions are against this flap 3
and still the pilot decides to do flap 3 because he has already committed that he would do so
because he wants to achieve the target of 98 and also
if that pilot is not rested well and he is fatigued
he is operating on the 15th because he had applied for a sick and his off day was cancelled
Imagine all these factors combined and now think where we are going
In aviation no accident happens just because of one factor
It is never going to happen solely because of one flap 3 factor
This will be a combination of all the factors and one day all the things will align
and a mishap will occur
We should be proactive in rectifying mistakes right where they are
It has been our habit since forever that we wait for something to happen and then find out why that happened
The third issue that you raised is the most critical in my opinion because
basically if the DGCA circulars on COVID19 were ignored
then I think that the exponential rise of the COVID cases in our country today
could be because the airlines did not follow the rules
They cases that were coming in those that could have been stopped right at the airport itself
if there were sound rules at the airport maybe this situation could have been avoided
Do you also feel the same way?
Dhruv when these talks were ongoing in March
then there were several times when these procedures were not being followed
I always intimated the company We also have a WhatsApp group of pilots
that is run by management pilots  Now  calingl it official or unofficial is upto you
So I notified this there as well
The others raised similar concerns But it was on 23rd of March specifically when I saw
that a lot of procedures were not being followed and carelessness was on the rise
Then I documented it We have a report called the Voyage Report
which is read by the captainPIC of the flight
I specifically wrote there that DGCA circular number soandso is not being followed
And I being the captain and the PIC of the flight I have the full responsibility
Until I ensure the safety of the passengers sitting behind me
I have the full authority to signor not sign the document
And whenever we sign the document stating that we accept this flight
We take full responsibility of that aircraft
So when I know that there is such a glaring shortcoming how do I accept it without doing anything about it?
Did you as a pilot have authority to delay the flight if the rules were not being followed?
Yes Dhruv The PIC has full authority to do that And I did delay a flight on 23rd of March
and I did write down the reason that the circulars were not being followed There were other points as well
The document that I signed required me to fill in the flight arrival and departure time as for all the flights
That document is extremely important and the management reviews it very carefully
If any flight gets delayed by a minute and we write down that it was delayed then we get a call the next day
asking Captain what was the reason for the delay of the flight?
Can you give us any explanation or how can we improve it?
OTP is such an important matter for us that we keep stressing on being on time
But when a captain writes it down and tells you that some rules are not being followed
which is risking the lives of the people sitting behind as well as his life
and it would be a risk to his family when he goes back home
This extremely important document that I am writing down and handing in
I never got an email or a call regarding it yet
asking the details of what was not being followed as per his complaint
and how could it be improved in the future
I was never contacted regarding this
We always try and be on time because being on time is companys PR
Which I agree is extremely important
And we contribute fully to make that happen
theres something more important than that safety
Dhruv let me explain it with an example Say there are a 100 employees in a company
50 out of them would not be concerned with what is happening around them
40 out of them would take cognizance of the wrongs being done and would whisper amongst themselves
but they will not take this up
8 out of those would tell the boss about the wrongdoings in written
The boss says that necessary steps would be taken
Then those 8 employees would eventually take a back seat thinking this is how it happens in India
But only 1 out of those would stand up and say
that he has had it enough and has brought things to the attention of the authorities enough times
and that he has taken it up enough number of times
But yet nothing is done about it
and he refuses to work in those conditions because that would endanger the lives of everyone
and endanger the lives of his family and him
I stand up and I refuse to work till all these things continue and till negligence reigns
So that was my attitude I stood up and on 23rd of March I wrote it down and refused to work on 24th
I said that a lot of negligence was taking place and that it was putting everyones lives at risk passengers crew and my family
That is why I took this step
And all these policies regarding COVID flap 3
In the case of sickness their man days are being saved if they relabel sick as an off
then they are able to get extra work done and are able to save up on man days
If you do not follow the COVID guidelines because it would incur more costs in the form of  more staffs
and extra equipment they would have to get sanitizers installed and arrange for PPEs
Everything comes at a cost
And as you know that there is direct fuel saving in the case of Flap 3
All these policies that I stood up against are the profit making policies of the company
And the company was noticing that time and again this person was standing up and pointing fingers at policies that
hamper our profit
Even though it was safety that I stood up for
So when there was requirement for pilots the company kept taking in complaints without saying anything
But as soon as the COVID time arrived and their operations slumped
and  they were aware that even when things opened up they would not need so many pilots
They directly targeted me and then threw me out of the country
I saw boycott Air Asia trending on Twitter
The media also took up your issue
The Minister of Aviation also responded to that tweet
But there has been no progress regarding this What do you think is
being done by the Ministry and the Airlines in the meantime?
I saw that this was trending on Twitter the day I put up this video but I had no idea that this would trend
and who made this trend The people took this upon themselves to make it trend
After that DGCI also made a public tweet that they would take this up
that somebody has raised a complaint against some airline
But I never got a specific acknowledgement from the DGCA or any communication from the aviation Minister
I have not yet received an official confirmation or communication from anywhere
Dhruv Id only like to point out that this is a fact based case and I would request the authorities
to conduct a fair investigation into this
I want nothing else All I want is a fair investigation
The most important thing is that Air Asia should respond to these questions
What answer does Air Asia have to the three safety issues that have been raised
The Air Asia must say something either accept or deny these allegations
Share this video so that it reaches more and more people and that it mounts pressure on Air Asia
to respond to the question of whether our safety is in danger or not

Thank you
youtuber gaurav taneja aka flying beast made a tweet a few days back
hes an iit graduate and i was surprised to see him buy into this kind of
just goes to show no matter how educated you are you can still fall prey to it wre gonna look at
this claim analyze where it comes from and talk about such religious science claims in general
for those who dont know gaurav tanija which i think is very few of you his youtube channel is
called flying beast he uploads daily vlogs and uses the cuteness of his children for clickbait
this he has been criticized for a lot but whatever you might think he is a very skilled youtuber very
well respected in the vlogging community his vlogs get a million plus views every day he has a loyal
fan base and i expect this video to be getting a ton of dislikes soon but i must do what i do
on this channel which is fight irrationality being spread by these pages but this time its not just
another huge youtube channel its run by an iit kharagpur alumnus a qualified pilot a bodybuilder
and someone who has recently gotten into studying law but no amount of education can remove the
years of religious indoctrination as shown by this tweet but you know what lets not jump to
conclusions lets actually analyze what he said in this tweet because hey you can make extraordinary
claims you just have to back it up with extraordinary evidence lets see what evidence
he actually provides two families survived the bhopal gas tragedy uh by doing agni hotra thats
the fire ceremony that you can see him doing in this picture here now the bhopal gas tragedy was
a factory accident that took place in 1984 where this highly toxic gas called mic methyl isocyanate
leaked in the city of bhopal leaked into residence houses and thousands of people lost their lives
now if you want to learn what led up to the accident and what happened after it i highly
recommend dhruv rathees video ive linked it in the description now where does this claim
come from all sources point to a newspaper article that was apparently published in 1985 which talks
about these two families that woke up in the on the night of the tragedy vomiting because of the
poisonous gases toxic gases and instead of evacuating like any sane family would they decide
to sit and do agnihotra and within 20 minutes their symptoms of gas parsoning vanished now
how can that be possible when methyl isocyanate is flammable it burns producing even more toxic gases
like hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide etc how on earth can you perform a fire ceremony in its
presence hey in case you dont die by breathing in mic you can ensure that you burn your entire
house down by doing this okay lets assume that the gas is not flammable or maybe it wasnt
in sufficient enough quantity to catch fire noticeably even then there is a logical fallacy
when you come to this conclusion when you say that the agni hotra is what saved the lives of those
people lets see what it is we dont know how much of this claim is true especially given that mic is
flammable this newspaper article sounds like a whatsapp forward by someone who wanted to use a
tragedy involving the the deaths of thousands of people to promote their version of superiority of
their religion even if you assume the details of the story to be true this conclusion that has been
drawn has a logical flaw in it when you say that a happened and then b happened therefore a caused b
youre mistaking correlation for causation the agni hotra and the families surviving the tragedy are
two events that are correlated but if you conclude that they survived because of this agnihotra then
you are committing this fallacy youre ignoring all the other factors that may have been bigger
reasons for why they survived like how much of the toxic gas was in the air what was the airflow
like that night with respect to the houses uh what was the wind speed and direction in
the location and how far away was the house from the factory and how did all these factors affect
how much toxic gases were in the air we shouldnt jump to conclusions without a clear knowledge of
all these factors especially when the claim were making is extraordinary like this extraordinary
claims require extraordinary evidence im not rejecting the claim im simply not accepting it
because there is no convincing evidence but when it comes to Gaurav Tanejas claims on the
uh scientific superiority of the vedic scriptures it doesnt stop there lets see what else he said
in this video uploaded on august 8 2019 he talks about how although we see things from this lens
of modern science in the world today as we get older and we learn more about the world we
start losing our belief in modern science and we start trusting the vedas in our scriptures
he says how theres all the science in the bhagavadgita how it talks about atoms and
electrons and protons which honestly is a load of bull and ill explain why science is a method
it is not a body of knowledge it is not a list of facts and theories or our list of solutions
to problems it is a way of thinking a way of learning things about the world primarily through
observation a way of figuring out how true something is and if it should go in such a list
or not i have an entire playlist on my channel on this scientific method feel free to watch
now someone comes to me and says that theres this book from centuries ago which talks about
atoms and electrons and protons and the theory of evolution and they figured all this out without
using the scientific method then whatever that book says cannot be called scientific they may
be true or false but definitely not scientific we learned about electrons and protons through
careful experimentation and observation we learned about evolution through observation can you tell
me back when the bhagavadgita was written how could they have performed the experiments that led
to those conclusions they couldnt have but pranav you ask if they werent using the scientific
method how were they right i have two answers for your question one given what you know today you
try and force fit modern discoveries and try and find parallels that are there in the scriptures
that match with modern discoveries modern theories modern facts that we discovered recently and you
tend to ignore everything else that doesnt match with anything that we know today
this is a combination of hindsight bias and confirmation bias the other reason is
imagine youre in a dark room somewhere in the room there is a dart board and you have a bunch
of darts if you start throwing the darts what percentage of them will hit the mark a very
low percentage right you can see how its not zero percent even if you throw randomly in some
direction you could hit the bullseye its unlikely but you could hit it right now imagine if the room
was dimly lit you can make out some details in the room you can see roughly where the dart
board is and that helps you throw better making your throws get a higher percentage accuracy
and what if the room was well lit your accuracy would go up tremendously right the chance of you
not hitting the mark will only depend on how good or bad your aim is the same way back when
these books were written if there are things that turned out to be factually correct in these books
those small percentage of shorts in the dark that hit their mark a huge number
of these statements are just plain false but you ignore them and pick only the ones that are true
knowing what you know today and you call them scientific what logic is this things
like ayurveda probably did a lot of trial and error before arriving at their results
and they probably had better accuracy much like the dimly lit room from my example
but simple trial and error is prone to a lot of mistakes which are overcome by modern medical
trials ive gone to that extensively in this video plus we had no knowledge of germ theory before the
17th century plus with advancements in chemistry and biology we know the mechanisms in which these
medicines work and that has helped us design much more better medications for certain conditions
we also have ways of evaluating the safety of medicines which we didnt have back then
ayurveda may have achieved results many centuries ago doesnt mean its the best tool we have today
there is a very prevalent narrative that i whether superior to modern medicine ive heard many people
say it please dont buy into it what we have today is like my third example a much brighter room of
course we can miss but the chance of hitting are much much higher than anything we had in the
past and plus you dont need to establish your religion cultural tradition as scientific only
people with an inferiority complex will do that your culture is beautiful as it is dont embarrass
yourself by posting tweets like this now there is a chance that he knew exactly what he was doing
he didnt actually believe what he said but he said that only to please the uh his audience or
he knew his audience really well and he knew the majority of his audience
would like a post like that and thats why he posted it in which case i dont really have
a lot to say about him hes just being really manipulative and if people dont recognize that
they can fall to traps like these so yeah and the next time you see someone say some modern
scientific fact is mentioned in scripture just remember they just shots in the dark some may hit
the mark doesnt mean they were aimed ill see you in the next one till then remember science is dope
Recently Flying Beast
has filed a defamation legal case of 2 crores against a journalist
What is true and what is not
Will discuss it today
Lets know in this video
The purpose of this video is not to hate anyone
only to put a researched opinion in front of you
And in the end I will leave it to you
what did you understand
and what do you consider to be wrong and right
This video is just for education and awareness which is our mission
and we believe that nothing will be hidden now
All the things
that I am sharing here you will find their public sources
through the link in the video description and you can read them yourself
Flying Beast has announced on his Instagram handle
that he has won a case
Will analyze that case completely
and together with the Havan Controversy
This tweet you are seeing
was tweeted by Flying Beast on its own Twitter handle
and after that there was a lot of trolling
So was Flying Beast right or wrong?
Whether his trolling was right or wrong
we will analyze it
And together we will discuss whats the responsibility of influencers
journalists and brands
Who should be guilty in this whole matter
and who is not lets talk in this video
Lets go
Flying Beast is a person who practices his culture
and talks about it loudly
Someone has a face in their culture
and feel proud about his culture
and Flying Beasts do the same
because their content is family vlogging real life vlogging
which is visible in their vlogs and tweets
When Flying Beast does this Abhishek Bakshi
a socalled journalist
attacks Flying Beast
and says that Abish Mathew who is a huge creator
whose show is visited by big celebrities
big celebrities
How did this bring these people
who do not know
on which fruit their daughters name is
Obviously here Abhishek was right
that there is a difference between raspberry and Rashbhari
It is not that
there is an English meaning and its Hindi meaning is this
Its not like this  Both are different fruits
But would you judge someones credentials by this?
Flying Beast is collaborating with Abish Mathew here
who has 1 million subscribers
and Flying Beast has so many
So who has more advantage here
maybe Abhishek could not understand
Maybe some people who think they are intllectual
and think that they are creative They think that
understanding English is very important
He did not see how many amazing stories Ritu and Gaurav shared
on the naming of their daughter
I guess he missed it
Ritu and I were expecting to download this app
So we downloaded this app
Someone suggested my sister suggested!
So every week  it used to show the progress of baby
Now the baby is of almost puppy size
grown to the size of this
I think during 8 weeks or nine weeks
Now your babys size is of raspberry
Thats she was pleased to know that my baby is like a raspberry
Like a raspberry
And then RashhnhariRashbhari  We started calling her
Which was a very good highlight of this interview of this entire segment
These stories are not PR driven
they are real
Abhishek could not understand this
but his attack continued
and he has made four tweets
He spoke dirty words about Flying Beast
and attacked Brands
He started attacking the livelihood of flying beast
Abhishek If you are not getting the brands yourself
then where is it right to make such attacks on someone elses livelihood?
Is this right or wrong please tell me in the comments
All who are watching this video
before you think that videos is going to be biased
Watch my video which was about Flying Beasts birthday
You will understand that Im not a fan
Im not a fellow creator
whos just trying to say goody things about one of the creator
I feel it was a huge blunder
whether it was wrong or right to arrest I dont know!
But when you have booked an entire metro
and you have so many million followers
even after booking the entire metro you cannot handle them
So it was blunder in a way
Nobody can take that away!
Everything on this channel is unbiased
depending upon whos right and whos wrong
all that particular incident on that particular day
on that particular event
And to analyze this event many things will have to be analyzed
and that is what we are doing
Keep watching!
The fourth tweet of Abhishek in this is very shameful
In this he is telling that the flying beast is mysogynist
Do you understand misogynist?
One who discriminates against another gender
Many more words have come from Misogynist like Patriarchy and many other words
In this he highlights an incident in which Ritu is in labor pain
nd she touches Gauravs feet
He has shown a snapshot
But I would love to show you the full energy of that vlog
Now Ritu is actually in labour
But what she is saying  I didnt touch feet
So Im going to do that
Shes touching feet
I dont know if those educated and intellectual people know
touching feet is not just about
mysogyny and
somebody being superior or inferior
Its about transmitting energies
When a woman is in labor pain she needs energy
So touching her feet means taking energy
I think this is the thing which is in our old culture that people do not know
Thats why people create judgments and assumptions
and attack people in such a way that
why are you collaborating with them
I would like to ask
if a man is practicing his religion
practicing his faith and his culture whats wrong in that?
Could that be a basis whether those brands collaborate with him or not?
Lets go forward
Before we talk about Shephalis article
on whom there is a defamation case of full two crores
Before analyzing that article
I want to talk about the Havan controversy
which is related to this article because this article starts from tweets related to havan
tweets related to havan
Lets talk a little bit about this controversy
I didnt give my take at that time but I want to give now
Its very important
Gaurav tweets on 1st May that there is house warming ceremony in our house
which he writes as planet
which is okay people trolled him on this
which is again
He says that were doing house warming ceremony
Hinduism is a science based way of life
On 3rd Dec 1984
two families remained unaffected from Bhopal gas leak
and fourth is that
Havan which is a natural antidote to polllution
He said these four things
Many people trolled him on this
I would like to say something about this
Let us first talk abou Bhopal gas tragedy
More than 3000 people died in it
More than 500000 people were injured
And after this accident 12000 people died
And we are seeing the after effects of that thing till today
And it was because that gas was too toxic
One of the most toxic gases in the world
Methyl isocyanate
Thats a very dangerous compund
Due to this there is maximum penetration in your lungs
then there can be choking there
And because of this many people also died
lets analyze this tweet a bit
He said Hinduism is a science based of life
I thought religion is a set of believes and practices
For ex just like there are mantras in our Hindu religion
I also chant mantras
because I feel that the structure and combination of some mantras is such that
it produces certain vibrations and sounds
And this sound very much channelizes your state of mind
in the right direction and for which the mantra is
for which that sound is being produced
And if thats the case its a science right?
Because sciencescience is what?
If you observe such things if you chant mantras for 1 hour
and then see how you are feeling
and how is the energy around you
If you observe and see some difference thats a science
Science is all about that
You take a hypothesis and if you collect dataabout it and observe it
that gives you the result
Im okay with Gauravs tweets about this
that Hinduism is a science based of life
Therere many things about Hinduism infact every religion
If you understand it properly
it is very scientific
But people assume as I have already said
Thats the problem
Then the third thing that Gaurav said
is that he told about an incident
He told that the two families were unaffected that day
Infact he was referring to the article which was published in
English Daily in 1985
According to that article there are two families
in which one is Khuswaha family and the other is Prajapati family
Those both families remained unaffected
You read this entire article link is in the description
You can read this complete article and it has complete details
But that article
We cant research on this
Because there are so many things in it that are missing
There may be some other reasons that that family survived
sometimes there are casual relationships too
Now coming to the fourth statement of Flying Beast
He said they performed regular Agnihotra havan
which is a natural antidote to pollution
kind of leading to this thing that
that perhaps they were saved only by performing Agnihotra Havan
which is written in this article
It is not as if Flying Beast himself is telling
If we talk about this thing
whether this is a natural antidote to pollution or not
Many people trolled Flying Beast
Lots of intellectual people and educated people
They were blabbering without doing enough research
and gathering facts
Dhruv Rathi asked which gases are they which compound are they?
Is it sulphur oxide or nitrogen oxide?
Which oxide is that which gets reduced
Akash Banerjee even spoke that it was from WhatsApp University
Abhishek Bakshi came back and said
And replied something similar on the tweet
I would like to say that yes I believe that
Methyl isocyanate gas
is a flammable gas
It interacts when it goes into the atmosphere
It changes its form
And its effect is more on the people living on the ground
because there is more density there
But can you get relief if you are performing Havan somewhere?
I dont know
But guys based on my research
all the intellectual people
all the big creators whore watching this video
I want to share a research with them
It is on Research Gate
I am giving its link for you to read yourself
In that lab research it is clearly written
that when the Havan material that is on your screen
when put in a controlled environment
it was seen that sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide
Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter were reduced by 60
And these different quantities are in front of you
You can check those
And you can read the complete research
Link is in the description
Sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide are reduced by 5060
says that research
by doing havan
If you rubbish any faith any culture it is wrong
And if Gaurav is referring to something and saying
it has happened
should he be trolled?
And should it be accused that he is spreading propaganda?
I think this is wrong
And here comes the responsibility of the journalist
Is this personal hatred or is it their profession?
It is very important to understand this
Now lets talk about this article on which this case has run
on the basis of which Ritu and Gaurav
has filed a defamation case of two crores
Let us analyze what that article says
Shefali refers to the incident of that havan at the very beginning of this article
and says how Gaurav was very insensitive
for all those whose lives were lost people in that tragedy
He did not do research or maybe he was in haste
or was using Abhishek for facts
whose history is telling that
that he has been a hater of a particular ideology
All these tweets tell
If you refer to a person who is associated with the government
vs some creator who is practicing his culture
and who does not differentiate I think this is wrong
But Abhishek was not able to differentiate
He felt that Gaurav is the part of a propaganda machine
and according to me he gave all these facts to Shefali in haste
And the facts which he has given to Shefali
is just a small sample
Lets talk about this article and what was the problem in it
Shephali says that Gaurav does child abuse
And the incident that she has highlighted imagine what it could be
It is that they are piercing in her ears
The girl is saying that do not do vlogging
then he is telling her why not
This is child abuse
She drops a phone from a very high building
and her mother is scolding her
so it is child abuse
Shefali says that she has told all this by a child psychologist
Joy Santosh which I could not find anywhere
But I would like to ask whether it is child abuse or not
How can you tell from this reference?
You are targeting all the brands that work with Flying Beast and Ritu Rathee
based on your own assumptions and prejudice
And it is clear that you do less research
What is child abuse and what is not
I want to understand that
you are saying all this on the basis of Joy Santosh
which I am not getting anywhere
You are hunting brands and asking them for a statement
that why are you collaborating with them?
As if that youre not liking it
You are not getting the deals
and these people are getting it
There are many such creators all over the world
who do very strange and big things
in fact there are many celebrities
who sell cancer
You go to those celebrities who promote such brands
You go to a creator who has a great track record
who even when in the fitness industry
used to talk about facts
While there are many people
who make and have been making very irresponsible videos
It is a big deal that those people get ranking in the big magazines of our country
It is a big deal
You fall behind because of one or two references
Is this right or wrong
I would like to ask you this question
you guys tell me in the comments
Shefali says that some people are saying that
they will not even use brands
which are promoted by them
And Shefali quotes a gossip handle of a gossip community that it is posting
This gossip post of this gossip community
is it a good sample to tell
that people are not wanting to use this product
you tell me in this comment box
Or else it should be judged by that
what is the feature of the product which is promoted by him
How genuine is that product
what are the reviews of that product
what is the actual experience when you use that product
I would like to understand this from Shefali
whether she has done this research or not
You must have seen that
I do very little advertising of products on this channel
it is because I am not satisfied with that product
And if that was the case maybe it would make sense
Shefali highlights another issue
where Flying Beast is stating that about risks of live in relationship
and what can be its consequences
so on that basis
that your opinion doesnt match with her opinion
so he shouldnt be working with brands?
Brands shoulsnt work with him
Is it right?
He is just alerting people that he has seen and heard this
Such things come in the daily news
and if he is giving his opinion on it then what is wrong in it
He is saying that this is data
Have a look on the data
I am not saying that live in relationship is right or wrong
Infact I myself say that first stay with each other and see
But if you have data in front of you
and you are citing only that data have some problems
then because of this brands should not work with the creators
how far is it right or wrong I leave upto you Please tell
And I would like to ask that Shefali says in the same article
that all this is the fault of the brands not creators
There are brands in the title
and only Flying Beast is being talked about Why?
Shephali very smartly twists the article
This article is not for the Flying Beast
even though I am talking about the Flying Beast throughout the article
This article is not for Flying Beast it is for brands
What is Brands Responsibility?
I would like to ask you
what is the Responsibility of brands
Brands are commercial
they only see profit and use creators
They know that creators have real reach
their loyalty is direct connection
My audience has a connection with me
Ive connection with the people who are commenting below
When they listen to me they DMs me
that brother you speak on this You are our hope
and I feel responsible
Ive such connection with you guys
These journalists like Shefali will not be able to understand this
or generalists like Abhishek will not understand
what is your connection with me
how I make videos on your demand
and on my demand you do campaigns with me on Twitter
by devouting your precious time on my ask
Such journalists will not understand this
And I am not at all satisfied here with Shephali
that it is only the responsibility of the brands
I think it is the responsibility of the influencer to choose right product
It is the responsibility of the journalist
to write the article with full research and with no hatred
And the biggest responsibility here is not that of influencers and journalists
but your responsibility here is that
if someone is selling pan masala in the name of ad mouth freshener
then please condemn them
I think it is clear that there are many problems in this article
I think that is the reason
I am not saying that Flying Beast and Ritu Rathi are right in everything
They both also make mistakes
There is no human who doesnt make mistakes
Man is a mannequin of mistakes
I also make many mistakes
and it is very important to acknowledge my mistakes
Insinuating that performing Havan is a political propaganda
thats wrong
Talking about one or two things about someone that you think is wrong
saying on the basis that no one should work with him
You are insinuating on a post from someone of any gossip group
and when you are trolled on your article
then it becomes hatred
Isnt this hypocrisy?
Do you fall behind such a creator
who till date has not gone ahead on the basis of controversies
and has gone ahead on the basis of his content
vs you do not speak anything to people who are selling cancer
if this is not hypocrisy then what else?
If someone disagrees with you
should it be the result that you start attacking hisher livelihood
And here you see the pattern
that the person who is supplying you the content
is tweeting this again and again
these tweets are from a year ago imagine
A guy watches a movie and promotes it attack on him
A man says that the vaccine should be taken attack on him
You guys tell me whether its right or wrong
And you think that Intellectuals are right
and do not mislead you
you guys watch this video
its link is in the description and you will also see in the I button
I will say that if you like this video then share it in your community
dont forget to like and comment on this video
and share your opinion in this thread
We have two new communities on Facebook and Telegram
join them too
I am sharing their links
Because I think we should be present on all platforms
if we really need change to happen
Because youre watching Peepoye Im Akassh
And now
nothing will hide
Speaker Gaurav Taneja So Sadhguru did you start participating yoga at a very young
Sadhguru What do you mean when I was young?
Im young man
When I was in the gym for about seven years every day I could run up a coconut tree
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Who showed you this path?
Sadhguru I told you Ive been a worm
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Maybe youre like totally free free bird and
Sadhguru Hey bird has bird brain
I got a human brain Laughter
Instrumental music
Sadhguru A hungry man has no civilization has no morality
Is that the world we want to create?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Lets talk about organic farming
Sadhguru If the entire country goes into organic farming our food production will
come to twentyfive percent of what it is
How many people do you think will die out of that?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Hi Sadhguru can you tell us about the place we are going to?
Sadhguru Ah were going to the farm where theyre doing treebased agriculture
Yeah and you can see how the land has improved in a just a few years
Speaker Gaurav Taneja I see a lot of young people in the ashram
Sadhguru Only young people only young people
Speaker Gaurav Taneja From childhood I have heard people around me say that yoga
and spirituality are things that you should pursue after your retirement or towards the
end of your life
But at the Isha Foundation I see so many young people
What is the reason behind this?
Sadhguru Spirituality is not when youre no good for anything
Its Laughs
At the very beginning of your life you must do it
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But it is often said that we should live the material part of our
life and explore spirituality at a much later stage
Sadhguru See that is because of the images that theyve created of spirituality that
it is something that is antilife
Tell me you can
Anything that you have lets say your phone or your motorcycle the more you know about
it the better you can ride it isnt it?
Why is that not true with your life?
The more you know about this human mechanism the better you can do it
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Sadhguru I had one this one question in my mind for which I could
never find an answer was  when I used to watch Mahabharata there was a saying that
everything is predestined and nobody can change what is destined
Speaks in Hindi  not transcribed On the other hand they would always say that Life
is in your hands you should always work towards  Unclear it is your karma
So I always find these two things as contradictory
Sadhguru No no no nobody said that
This is all losers losers in life explaining it like this
Does Krishna look like a loser?
So in his given context hes doing everything possible
Well a lot of things didnt work out as he planned but the thing is he did his best
Speaker Gaurav Taneja So what do you have to say about teachings that say that everything
is predestined?
Sadhguru See those things are said by losers who have nothing to show for their life
You dont want to accept your failures and do better you want to explain your failures
Oh explain it  youll never know success in your life
Speaker Gaurav Taneja So you mean everything is determined by karma?
Sadhguru No no no
Karma means its your action
Yeah when you say My life is my karma youre saying My life is my making
This is the most dynamic way to exist but now people have twisted it and made it Aiyyo
Karma is not something that you inherit kand ma
karma is in what youre doing right now
So what life throws at you is not always your choice but what you do with it or how
you hit it is your choice
Right now there is a corner that is the way it is but how you take the corner is
entirely yours
Lets say somebody goes and crashes in this corner
Now they say The corner was difficult
Thats not the point
You didnt know how to take it thats all it is
Thats so with every aspect of life
Thats what karma means its your doing
If you make it its you if you dont make it its you
This is the only culture which has looked at life like this
Everywhere theyre saying God  he is doing everything
If God is doing everything why the hell are you here?
You got old hmm?
I started my yogic practices when I was eleven twelve years of age
And also by the time I was fourteen fifteen I was in the gym for about seven years every
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Besides yoga and flexibility did you also do a lot of stuff
like weightlifting and strength training and bodybuilding or going to the gym?
Sadhguru Not that kind of gym
I made sure that I were was? very lithe very strong
I could run up a coconut tree like that I was
So so for me strength and flexibility were more important than bulging muscles
So I kept myself very fit
Speaker Gaurav Taneja I also spend a lot of time in the gym working on myself
Sadhguru You dont have to s you dont have to say it I can see it Laughs
Speaker Gaurav Taneja So we are here in this place for
Sadhguru is going to tell us what is
Sadhguru Treebased agriculture
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Treebased agriculture
Sadhguru And what it does to the soil
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Yes for me it is all same thing because for me
Overlapping conversation
Sadhguru Yeah because youre a A320
You dont know what is soil what is earth Laughs
Speaker Gaurav Taneja For me it is same
Agriculture means trees and plants
Like thats what we do in agriculture right?
We plant trees but what is treebased agriculture?
Agriculture is all about tree farming plants
Sadhguru Hmm
See right now the important thing is this
What is happening to Indias soil and the worlds soil is this the organic content
is going away
Because year after year youre taking out the crop youre putting lot of pesticide
youre putting insecticide youre putting fertilizer but no organic content
Why organic content is this whole process of life happens because of microbial activity
Even you youre a bodybuilder but sixty percent hmm?
Sixty percent of you is just microbes you know that?
Only forty percent is genetic material
Sixty percent is just microbial life within you
So the food that you eat you cannot even digest it without their help
Similarly here in the soil whatever nutrients that are there the plant really cant take
it just like that
It has to exchange with the microbes
So it has to catch carbon from the air make it into carbon sugars pump it here and trading
okay for what it wants
So this is a very sophisticated marketplace in the soil
A handful of soil has anywhere between seven to ten billion organisms
So right now what we have done is using the trees the green whatever the material
that is there in terms of leaf we prune it and put it back into the soil continuously
And there are also some animals with the animal waste also go into this
See now
Speaker Gaurav Taneja  Unclear
Sadhguru it is notit is not rained in probably you know two twoandahalf
But you will see
Come youve never done this probably
Just dig here Im telling you
Is it wet still?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Yeah yeah
Its wet
Sadhguru Look at that
Look at that
Thats rich soil all right?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja The texture is different
Sadhguru Because its always covered like this  with leaf
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Is this how it is supposed to be?
Sadhguru Yeah its good
Speaker Gaurav Taneja You dont see
when you go to fields you dont see covered with leaves
Sadhguru That is because theyre killing it
Speaker Gaurav Taneja No but if the leaves fall on the ground
Sadhguru They will sweep it
Speaker Gaurav Taneja They will sweep it
Because of the
Sadhguru No because there are no leaves
Where is the leaf?
There are no trees
Youre flying
Do you
Did you ever fly in India?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Yes all the time
Sadhguru Youre flying for a an?
Indian airline?
Sadhguru Okay
So when you fly probably for a pilot you cant look down
Speaker Gaurav Taneja You cant look down
Sadhguru If you look down you will see except Western Ghat and northeastern part
of the country the whole country looks like a brown desert
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Even this soil is different
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Haan
Sadhguru Its full of life
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Microbes
Sadhguru If you increase the organic content here to eight to ten percent
Right now this may be around three to four percent
Speaker Gaurav Taneja This is three to four percent?
Sadhguru Yeah eight to ten percent if you make it your irrigation requirement will
come down to thirty percent of what it is right now
That is if youre using hundred liters of water thirty liters will do the same job
If you raise it to twelve to fifteen percent ten to fifteen percent of water will do irrigation
So just imagine 84 percent of Indias water is used for agriculture
If you bring it down to even twenty twentyfive percent of what it is therell be ample water
for everything
Right now were just plowing the land leaving it open
This is like peel off the skin stand in the sun you will be screaming
Land is just screaming
People dont hear thats all
Speaker Gaurav Taneja So youre saying only solution is plant more trees?
Sadhguru No no not only trees there are many ways to do it
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Okay
Sadhguru The important thing is the ground should be not ripped open with plowing
and left open to the Sun
Something should be there
There should be grasses there should be a crop
There should be some photosynthesis happening
So this leaf has come not just from the trees
They put cover crops and just chop it and put it right back here
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Okay okay okay
Sadhguru So with this the yields have gone up significantly
For farmers within lets say five to seven years many farmers are earning 300 to 800
percent more income
You must see this is a small farm its a recent one
These are all just five six year olds
You must enter a farm which is ten fifteen years old the water table has come up soil
organic content has gone up the nutrient level in the food has gone up significantly
Theyre getting a much better price in the marketplace
And above all the farmer is earning 300 to 800 percent more
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Sadhguru ji I have a question
It used to be Im saying it is supposed to be eight to ten percent whatever
We have by our own way made it down to three percent four percent
Sadhguru No no not 3 percent percent
4 percent
In India 62 percent of Indias soil organic content is below 05 percent
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Youre saying agricultural land or
Sadhguru Agricultural land
Speaker Gaurav Taneja  Unclear how much
Sadhguru Its gone below 05 percent
That means we are on the verge of desertification
Speaker Gaurav Taneja How many years we have?
Sadhguru According to the UN in the entire world there is only sixty to eighty harvests
left that is anywhere between fortyfive to sixty years max
Sadhguru By 2045 its expected we will be producing forty percent less food than what
were doing right now
And our populations will be over 9 billion 92 billion
Thats not a world you want to live in
Your two children they will be in that world if you dont turn it around now
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But the question was lets say 200 years back or 300 years
back the content was okay for
Sadhguru See
Speaker Gaurav Taneja for farming?
Sadhguru Im telling you
Not even that far away even fifty sixty years ago there was no farm in this country
without trees and animals
Now trees are gone animals are gone
Speaker Gaurav Taneja My
Thats my
My question is if everybody knows that Overlapping conversation
Sadhguru They knew
Speaker Gaurav Taneja that is more beneficial
Sadhguru Not that they know they knew
Speaker Gaurav Taneja They knew?
Sadhguru Now weve forgotten
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But why have we forgotten?
If this is a more
better way to
Sadhguru See its like this
Youre eating good food and youre doing well the doctor checks you up and says Well
your calcium is not good enough
Your vitamin B12 is not good enough your iron is not good enough and gives you three
pills for a month two months six months something
You took these pills and you felt really good
Then you decided I dont really have to eat
I just have to multiply the pills
Instead of three I will take thirty pills
Thats what we did to the land
We put little fertilizer everything burst out
We thought this is it
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Yes
Sadhguru And farmers were advise advised like this
Speaker Thats true
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Everything that happened during the Green Revolution?
Sadhguru Yes it did
But we must also understand and appreciate why that was done
See India was a country which was suffering with famines
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Yes yes yes
Sadhguru Millions of people used to die
Speaker Gaurav Taneja We were importing we were importing wheat
Sadhguru Not only that
Every other year there was famine
So famines means in 1942 famine over three three million people died
So this used to be the reality of this country
To offset that to bridge that somehow then we went into Green Revolution
So it is like youre unwell you took some pills and you got well
But then you should have improved your nourishment
But you just started taking only pills thinking it will make you well
Those same pills are making you sick now
So we are not against fertilizer not against pesticide not against anything
The important thing is organic content should be there because first thing is right now
we are consuming the soil of the unborn child
Sadhguru Were eating up the futures soil
So putting life back into this is the most important thing
Speaker Gaurav Taneja No
I read somewhere that you should leave the planet if not better
Sadhguru At least the way
Speaker Gaurav Taneja in the same way
Sadhguru at least the way it came to you
Speaker Gaurav Taneja it came to you or you received it from your ancestors
But we are degrading the planet and then giving it to our
Sadhguru Super degrading it
Im saying just imagine
Just imagine
Where are you from?
Where you live?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja No Delhi
Sadhguru Delhi
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Delhi Kanpur
Sadhguru Okay Delhi Kanpur wherever
In your city suppose forty percent less food is available in the shop
Not that you dont have money to buy there is no food forty percent less food
That means forty percent of the people are not eating enough or they have no food to
What do you think will happen to your city?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Chaos
Sadhguru What kind of chaos do you think?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja The poor will die they will not get food
Sadhguru Really?
You think theyll die?
No no
When they see you a wellbuilt guy like you theyll slaughter you
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Yeah
Sadhguru Thats not the way its going to happen
A hungry man has no civilization has no morality has no humanity left in him isnt it?
Sadhguru Well well push the world in that direction
Today UN agencies are predicting by 2035 therell be dozens of civil wars in the world
But right now if we act we can turn this around in the next twelve to fifteen years
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Another question
I was working on this project of rainwater harvesting
I went around with Jal boards of different cities
But then theres a problem
See my videos are watched by people around twentyfive to thirty years of age
Now the best solution I could give them was it was costing them 50 to 55000 rupees to
build a system for rainwater harvesting on their roof so that you can replenish
But then theyre saying ki we dont have 50000 rupees to spend
The problem why it fails
We make a video people watch it yes theres a problem
They will say Sadhguru ji is right
Sadhguru No no no I dont give such
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But but
Sadhguru I dont give that kind of solutions ever
Speaker Gaurav Taneja So what
Sadhguru Here Im saying this is not an ecological plan for the farmer
For the farmer this is an economic plan
But it has an ecological impact
So everything ecological we do is like this its an economic plan
Because if its not an economic plan itll anyway not succeed
They must make money out of it then only itll succeed and then only itll sustain
Okay even if I had 50000 55000 or 1 lakh rupees I spent it today
Will I spend it every year?
Whatever is needed?
It can only sustain if this becomes economically very good for me isnt it?
So this is about marrying economy and ecology
Otherwise there will be no success at all
Speaker Gaurav Taneja So youre saying farmers who are on the ground working on
their fields they should bring this change or a government policy change?
Policy change is a must
Because see today this farm is good
This is one generation of people
Because we have worked with them theyve made their farms like this
But lets say next generation comes they may do their own thing
For you to see an example for example you live in Delhi the New Delhi is built in a
certain way
Because if you have let us say 10000 square feet of land you cant build a 10000 square
foot building
You build 6 7000 allow some space for yourself your neighbor
This is the law
You cannot do it
If you do more theyll come and knock it down
But just go to Old Delhi and see theres no concept of a window
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Mhmm mhmm mhmm mhmm Indicating agreement
Sadhguru One door entry one door out
All sides there are more homes there is no possibility of a window
All right?
Is that the way to build a building?
That happened when there was no law
So right now if you have twentyfive acres of land you can plow every inch of it and
turn it into a desert in the next ten fifteen years time
Nobody will ask you Why are you doing such a damaging thing?
Because theres no law
We need a law that if you own agricultural land you must have minimum three to six percent
this is minimum to keep the soil alive
If you dont live well thats up to you
But you cant snatch away life from future generations right now
Because once soil is gone theres no life left
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja But Sadhguru ji In that case farmers would say that you
know they will earn less theyre already earning less
Sadhguru Arrey Im telling you theyre earning 300 to 800 percent more
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Mhmm Indicating agreement
Sadhguru This is wrong education that weve given them right?
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Mhmm Indicating agreement right
Sadhguru Tell me if the soil is rich will you earn less or more?
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja More
Sadhguru If the soil is rich will you commit suicide?
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja No
Sadhguru 300000 farmers have committed suicide in India
SpeakerRitu Rathee Taneja  Mhmm Indicating agreement
Sadhguru If the soil was rich even if they dont have money if they can grow food for
himself and his family will he kill himself?
Sadhguru Then why are we not looking at it?
In United States today in the last twelve years fifty percent of the farmers have not
seen a single dollar
Sadhguru And the highest suicide rate among all professions is among the farming community
Its not just in India
This is because there is no strength in the soil
Your costs are going on because every year you have to keep on increasing the dosage
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Yeah yeah yeah
Sadhguru of fertilizer and everything else
So costs are just rising by the year theyre not able to ta bear that
Otherwise if you raise the food prices other people will complain because inflation
they cant handle it
So the important thing is soil has to be rich
Soil should be alive because first twelve to fifteen inches of soil is the source for
eightyseven percent of life on this planet
When youre born you come out of it when you live you eat out of it when you die
you go back to it
Sadhguru This is the only magical place in the universe  not on the planet  where
if you sow death into it it bursts out with life
Tell me one other place like this
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Mhmm Indicating agreement
Sadhguru Lets make it happen
Save Soil
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But this is going to take at least two to three years of transition
period where farmers will earn less because
Sadhguru No no why?
Why are you
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Straight away from the next harvest they will earn more?
Sadhguru See because in your head it is stuck you must do organic farming
This organic farming is a crime committed by urban people
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Lets talk about organic farming because
Sadhguru No no
Speaker Gaurav Taneja we pay so much to get organic foods
Im not saying its not good
I am saying you never worked on the land
So suddenly you declare Organic farming
Right now if the entire country goes into organic farming without fertilizer without
pesticide without any of those things our food production will come to twentyfive percent
of what it is
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Sadhguru thats what exactly I want to ask ki how to bring
this change?
Im telling you institute it in the policy first
If you
Like in the city there is a law
If you build a house there must be so much ventilation so much space whatever
Similarly if you own an agricultural land minimum three to six percent organic content
should be there
Speaker Mhmm Indicating agreement
Sadhguru If that is there you will use a certain amount of chemicals and stuff to grow
But if you increase the organic content to lets say six percent to eight percent or
ten percent then your fertilizer and everything will come down your input cost will come
Well you may take two three years to make this re
But that also can be offset very quickly within a year you can do it
If the government is willing to give some subsidy for enrichment of soil you understand?
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Right
Sadhguru See in Tamil Nadu we promoted this in the last twentyfour twentyfive
years Ive been telling the farmers ten percent of your land should be trees which
will provide foliage for the remaining ninety percent
Sadhguru If you dont invest that ten percent then everything will die
Now if you invest that ten percent you think youre earning less?
In the remaining ninety percent you earn much more than what you were earning with
full hundred percent
But we are not saying Dont use fertilizer
As the soil becomes richer the use of fertilizer will naturally go down
Sadhguru So we are not anti anything
This is not Dont use fertilizer dont do
These are things are said by urban people who have never done farming
Farming is a heartbreaking job
Once there is no necessary you know inputs to do that
See you dont have to do agriculture like its some kind of philosophy or a religion
This is not what you believe in
This is about making a practical solution out of this
Sadhguru Im just saying dont cut the golden goose
If I have to say it very simply wait for the eggs to come Laughs
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But its scary to listen to the timelines what you have told
2035 will be desert
Sadhguru See right now we are partnering with UN CCD
Thats a agency UN agency for combating desertification
Desertification is the biggest problem in the planet right now
Nobodys talking about it because theres no money in it
Everybodys talking about fossil fuels automobiles coal this one that one because if you knock
industry it spills dollars
Here you cant go and knock anybody you have to spend your life to make it happen
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Exactly
Sadhguru To convert about 125000 farmers to to treebased agriculture in Tamil Nadu
and Karnataka twentyfive years of our life is gone in this
Speaker Gaurav Taneja With no reward
Sadhguru Not that there is no reward
Speaker Gaurav Taneja No to the people who are volunteering
Sadhguru No they dont look for a reward
They want to do it
Sadhguru Whats a reward?
Were alive and were happy thats a reward Laughs
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Mhmm Indicating agreement True
Sadhguru What other reward is there in life?
You want a crown Laughs?
Very uncomfortable damn thing to wear just know that Laughter
Can you imagine a metal ring on your head?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja I always used to wonder that in our epic
Sadhguru Its a terrible thing to wear Laughs
Speaker Gaurav Taneja It is shown it is of gold
Sadhguru See right now youre wearing a helmet its properly cushioned everything
that only irritates you after some time
Speaker Gaurav Taneja After some time  Unclear
Sadhguru Just a metal ring metal ring you put it on your head and walk around
Thats the silliest thing to do
So were not looking for a crown Laughs
Rich with life its reverberating
The land thats how it should be
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Sadhguru ji where do you do so much research?
Do you read?
Sadhguru No no I dont do any research
Speaker Gaurav Taneja You have a lot of
Im not talking about what you tell about spirituality life
Sadhguru Even the soil
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But this soil tree seeds
Sadhguru this is because you know for six and a half decades I have lived on this
Others dont live on this planet they live in their head
I dont have anything in my head
So I live on the planet
Im like a worm
You ask a worm it knows what is the soil condition isnt it?
Do you think the worm in this soil knows more about this soil than a scientist?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But it cannot tell us
Sadhguru No this worm can speak
Thats the only difference Laughter
That worm also speaks youre not understanding the language
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Yes maybe Sadhguru laughs
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But it is strange to see that what is affecting our life what
is affecting our children we are not
Because nobody
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Even when I heard about I was talking to swami ji
He told me about all that
Desert its going to turn to desert and the fruits and the vegetables itself if the
soil doesnt have any nutrition
Sadhguru It has nothing
See right now its a fashion to eat salads in America
Speaker Gaurav Taneja No even in India
Sadhguru But for example
Speaker Gaurav Taneja I eat salads
Sadhguru All right
You eat salad?
Youve been eating a buffalo Laughs
So in California especially its very fashionable
But one important item
This is the only thing which has been studied
If you study everything itll all come out
Lettuce for example
Sadhguru It has only ten percent of the nutrition it had hundred years ago
In 1920 if you ate it what you got today youre getting ninety percent less
Youre eating trash
This is what weve done to our food
If you ate one orange in 1920 today you will have to eat eight oranges to get the same
Can you eat eight oranges?
Even you cant eat
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But then people in 1920 must be starving
You cant
The amount of food you eat amount of space you have in the stomach you need
Sadhguru No if the food is rich you dont need that much quantity
Right now people are eating much more than what they should eat because it lacks nourishment
Speaker Gaurav Taneja I thought it is because of the volume it satisfies the hunger
Sadhguru No no that is also there
See what level of activity  physical activity  people were putting in 1920 and what level
of activity youre putting now is not even ten percent
Sadhguru Everything had to be done with your body
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Now we have machinery
Sadhguru So we can think its like you know in the petrol
Whether you want to ride with a hundred octane or you want to ride with fifty octane its
a big difference Laughs
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja So you know what happened Sadhguru?
One day I was flying with another captain even Im a captain
Sadhguru Oh youre also a pilot?
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Yes Im also a pilot
Im with Indigo airline
So he told me about you
And one day I was on layover and then I actually tried to do Isha Kriya
Although I failed at it but yes
Then I started following your videos and your ideology
Sadhguru Hey I have no ideology
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Not exactly ideology but
Sadhguru Simply life sense
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Haanji life sense
But yes like
my father tells me this every time
See like as a child needs a teacher to you know guide in a certain way my father
told me that a person needs somebody
I mean like for me its you
Sadhguru See flying an airplane its such a simple damn thing
If you just pull it it will fly
But if there was no trainer you think you would have?
Youd be dead probably
Isnt it Laughs?
Thats what my father tells me
Sadhguru Any unknown terrain if you want to walk
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Sadhguru ji question comes that okay so many people follow you
You are the trainer who shows them the path
Who showed you this path?
Ive lived on this planet absorbed life
Speaker Gaurav Taneja No but Ive seen so many of his videos
He never answers this question Ritu Rathee Taneja laughs
Sadhguru Do I look like I was trained by somebody?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja No I dont know
Im asking
Sadhguru No no just tell me looking at me Laughs
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja I didnt feel like
I feel like that maybe youre like totally free free bird and
Sadhguru Hey bird has bird brain Ritu Rathee Taneja laughs
Dont tell call me a bird
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Speaks in Hindi  not transcribed Its very sweet
Sadhguru Yes
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Because the soil has micro
microorganisms right?
It has more nutrition?
Sadhguru Definitely it has
Those neat looking agricultural lands lines and lines they are not good lands
Unfortunately weve advertised like that  thats how land should look
No this is how it should look  full of vegetation
Sadhguru Farmer is living a quiet nice life with a house family settled
Both his children are welleducated now
All from the farm
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But Sadhguru ji you know she is from Haryana a farming background
But the main problem is everyone is sending their kids to cities
They dont want them to be farmers
Sadhguru Unfortunately yeah
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Even a for
Sadhguru We have made some kind of a rudimentary survey
Not even two percent of the farmers want their children to become farmers
Speaker Gaurav Taneja And even for they want
That is a thing just imagine in twentyfive years if this generation passes where is
the food security for this country?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Are you taking the same bike to ride in Europe?
Sadhguru Europe Im riding a GT 1600
Arabia Im riding this
From Tel Aviv to Oman Im riding this
Sounds of Isha music  Soil Song Lalale Lale Lale
the mi 24
is one of the most admired and feared
attack helicopters
with its impressive appearance and high
weapon carrying capacity
this flying beast whose nato reporting
name is hind
has proven itself in major battles in
many parts of the world
the helicopter which can still find new
users with its new models
left its mark on half a century both
and culturally now were investigating
the mi24
a true attack helicopter legend please
dont forget subscribe to our channel
before we start
and give us a thumbs up if you like our
video to be notified of our new video
please click the bell button
preferred by more than 60 countries the
mi 24
is the most widely used helicopter and
has fought
in many parts of the world it has been
an important system
that couldnt be ignored not only by
western military planners
but also by hollywood dont you think a
puma that resembles the mi 24
deserved the award for the best
supporting actor and made ramba 2 and
rambo 3
a part of the list of legendary movies
and isnt it possible to see its impact
even in the struggle for life and death
between jedi and sit in a galaxy far
far away although it has become a legend
in the beginning the faith of soviet
military planners about the mi 24
was very low in the early 1960s
the soviet mill company started to work
on an innovative system
which was basically a flying infantry
fighting vehicle
it meant that the new helicopter should
be able to perform
both fire support and infantry transport
in 1966 mill unveiled a mockup to
demonstrate its new concept
the value of this new concept was
immediately apparent to some
but many were skeptical of it yet
the us armys successful use of gunship
helicopters in vietnam
ended the debate between these two
groups in a short time
thus mill presented two conceptual
one was the comparatively small and
single engine
and the other was the heavy and twin
kamov also offered a version of the
ka25 naval helicopter
as a lowcost solution for this
after extensive consideration in 1968
the soviet armys preference was mels
heavy helicopter concept
flight test of mills helicopter
prototype began one year later
in simple term it was a highly modified
whose nato reporting name is hip for
gunship helicopter world
many airframe components and
subcomponent came from mi8
and its naval variant mi14 whose nato
reporting name
is haze in 1970
acceptance tests started after 18 months
of trials
many changes were required for example
the fuselage was
strengthened to solve fatigue problems
and vibration levels
the position of antitank missile pylons
was moved from the fuselage to the
after these changes the mass production
of the helicopter
now called mi24a started in 1970
it became operational in 1972
however the mi 24a was more like a test
than a real gunship helicopter while
mass production of this model continued
the mill engineers had to deal with many
design flaws
for example the three blade tail rotor
which was on the starboard in the first
production versions of the mi 24a
had been repositioned to the port site
to increase efficiency in later models
also the design of the cockpit was
causing an inadequate view for the pilot
the mi 24d whose mass production began
in 1973
has ended these problems unlike its
this model has a tandem cockpit with a
double bubble canopy
the rear seat is 30 centimeters higher
than the front
all later versions of the helicopter
have this configuration
the pilot and the gunner seat inside the
titanium armored tub
in the cockpit their windscreens are
in an emergency the gunner can also fly
the helicopter
thanks to the over pressurized cockpit
and troop compartment
the helicopter can be operated in an nbc
the armored fuselush and the titanium
rotor blades are resistant against
127 millimeter rounds there are three
pylons on the mid mounted stop wings
at high speed they provide considerable
the design of airframe has high
aerodynamic efficiency
also the mi 24 fitted with retractable
landing gear to reduce track
these futures make the helicopter fast
unlike other attack helicopters the mi
is capable of carrying eight infantry
however experiences during the soviet
invasion of afghanistan
showed that this capability didnt work
as expected
for the soviet mi24 crew members
fighting in afghanistan
both engaging on targets and thinking
about the safety of the transported
had been too much of a burden besides
carrying eight soldiers and the armor
plates in the troop compartment
decreased the performance of the
helicopter as it increased the weight
to overcome these problems the soviet
army started to use mi24s in fire
support missions
and the mi8s in troop transport
it has been observed that carrying a
technician with additional fuel and
ammunition in this compartment
allows the mi 24s to be used longer and
more effectively
also carrying a technician who handles
the light machine gun in a window port
was providing the mi24 the ability to
watch its back
while leaving a target area depending on
its model
the mi 24 is equipped with different
the mi 24a had a oneman operated
gun on its nose the mi 24d
version has a fourbarrel 127
millimeter machine gun
mounted for the turret while the mi 24p
model has a 30 millimeter twin barrelled
cannon in a fixed position on its right
the mi 24 vp has a 23 millimeter twin
barrel gun
in the beginning the soviet army planned
to use the 9k 114
term antitank missiles whose nato
is at6 spiral with the mi 24s
however due to the delay in the
development of this missile
the helicopter was first equipped with
the three m11 phalanga
yet this missile whose nato reporting
name was
at2 swatter was obsolete in those years
for this reason many users have equipped
their mi24s with the 9m14 malutka
whose nato reporting name is at3 sagar
in the following period the helicopter
has gained the capability of firing the
9k 114 today
modernized mi24s can use high capability
antitank missiles
such as the 9m120 attacker whose nato
is at9 spiral 2 the helicopter has a
twoman crew
many countries have also added a
technician to the crew
the mi 24 can carry eight infantries
the fuselage has a length of 1751
and the total length of the helicopter
is 1979 meters
its rotor diameter is 173 meters
while its height is about 547 meters
with an empty weight of 7580 kilograms
the maximum takeoff weight is 11 500
two 600 kilowatt tv3 117v
turboshaft engines provide a maximum
speed of 310 kilometers per hour
the cruising speed of the helicopter is
270 kilometers per hour
the mi 24 which has a range of 450
can reach a range of 1000 kilometers
with external fuel tanks
its service ceiling is 4950 meters
while its power ceiling is 1400 meters
as we mentioned earlier the weapons of
differs depending on its models the
helicopter has many production
and modernized variants since it will
take a lot of time to talk about all of
we will focus on some major versions
export models of the mi24s are called
the mi 25 is the simplified and low cost
specifically for third world use
the mi 24 super hind mark 3 is the
modernized version of the helicopter
by paramount advanced technologies of
south africa
this variant has a 20 millimeter vector
f2 gun in a new chin turret
with an external ammunition storage the
helicopter can fire the longrange
laser guided zt3 ingui antitank missile
the super hind mark iv model is equipped
with the ukrainian barrier
antitank missile the mi24vm
has nonretractable landing gear and
shortened wings
there are two pylons under the wings
instead of three
this variant has elastomeric bearings
composite main rotor blades and xshaped
tail rotor
same as mi28 the helicopter
uses a kilimo vk2502
turboshaft engines which provide better
high altitude performance
the avionics and electrooptic
surveillance systems
are also modernized even though the ussr
planned to replace the mi24s with a new
attack helicopter in the 1970s
due to its low antitank capacity it
proved itself
as indispensable in many battles
the mi24 was used in combat for the
first time
by ethiopia during the organ war the
helicopters were one of the key weapon
systems for ethiopian victory
over somalia but the mi 24
gained its real reputation during the
soviet invasion of afghanistan
in the early stages of the war it was a
weapon of terror
for the mujahideen one ceremony 24
scared a group of mujahideen away by
just maneuvering aggressively
to rescue a company of infantry however
the helicopter had been out of
besides escorting troop helicopters and
providing air support for ground forces
the mi24s were protecting land convoys
against ambushes the soviet army was
additional using them for hunter killer
the mi 24 hunter kilo groups were
consisting of a minimum of two
more often the soviet army preferred the
groups of four
or eight mi24s to provide mutual fire
the majority could occasionally counter
the mi24s with rpg type weapons
and machine guns heavier than 127
however these efforts were rare and
after a while the balances changed with
the stinger and redeye missiles
that came with the us assistance now
it was time for the mi24s to be scared
according to russian sources 27 mi24s
were shut down by these missiles in
but western sources estimate that this
number is much higher
although they were the nightmare of the
iranian infantry during the iraniraq
the iraqi mi25s were quite insufficient
for antiattack missions to overcome
this problem
the iraqis started to use them in hunter
killer groups
together with the gazelle carrying the
hot missiles
while the mi25s were dealing with the
infantry and air defense troops
the gazelles were attacking two tanks
during this war
the iraqi mi25s conducted many
airtoair helicopter combats
according to some sources during the war
the heinz claimed 10 victories
against ah ones in exchange of six lost
even once an iraqi mi24d
managed to shut down an iranian f4
phantom 2
using s5 unguided rockets iraqi mi25s
also claimed 43 kills against other
iranian helicopters
such as uhones it is claimed that in
a russian mi24 vp shot down a georgian
su25 using a 9k 114
antitank missile while in the 1980s
many analysts thought that the modern
attack helicopters overshadowed the
it has shined brighter once again after
after the end of the first cold war many
african countries
that needed an aircraft for
counterinsurgency missions
began to acquire the surplus heinz the
mi 24s
have played important roles in all
corners of this continent
the mi 24 is still successfully fighting
in africa
as well as afghanistan iraq and syria
it is an indispensable helicopter in
russia which announced that it would
replace the hind fleet with the mi28s
and k52s by 2015
changed this decision the russian mi24s
are being modernized
and will continue to instill fear in
their enemies
for many years to come the helicopter
is continuing to add new pages to its
the combat proven impressive beast mi24
deserves to be called a true legend

They are among the most terrifying of Saurons beasts Great winged creatures
these hellhawks would become the steed of choice for the Nazgul Bearing their dark masters
they would bring terror from the skies
Today on Nerd of the Rings we cover the Fell Beasts of the Nazgul
While the Fell Beasts are mysterious creatures and we dont know their exact
origin we are given clues We know that like his master before him
Sauron clearly saw the value of being capable of aerial battle in addition to aerial travel
Where Morgoth would create the winged dragons that debut in the War of Wrath
Sauron brings about the fell beasts that would be revealed during the War of the Ring
After a journey that began in secrecy
the ringwraiths horses are killed when they are swept away by the River Bruinen Forced
to return to Mordor on foot Saurons servants turn to their more speedy and deadly steeds
The first appearance of a fell beast though we dont know it at the time is on the night of
February 23 when the fellowship is making its way down the Anduin river after their stay in Lorien
A dark shape like a cloud and yet not a cloud for it moved far more swiftly
came out of the blackness in the South and sped towards the Company blotting out all light as
it approached Soon it appeared as a great winged creature blacker than the pits in the night
Suddenly the great bow of Lrien sang Shrill went the arrow from the elvenstring Frodo looked up
Almost above him the winged shape swerved There was a harsh croaking scream
as it fell out of the air vanishing down into the gloom of the eastern shore The sky was
clean again There was a tumult of many voices far away cursing and wailing in the darkness
and then silence Neither shaft nor cry came again from the east that night
It is not until chapter 3 of the The Two Towers that we get a hint that Legolas had indeed shot
down the mount of a Nazgul and that these beasts were far greater than mere means of travel
UGLUK Whats happened to your precious Nazgl? Has he had another mount shot under him? Now
if youd brought him along that might have been usefulif these Nazgl are all they make out
Nazgl Nazgl said Grishnkh shivering and licking his lips
as if the word had a foul taste that he savoured painfully You speak of what is deep beyond the
reach of your muddy dreams Uglk he said Nazgl! Ah! All that they make out! One day
youll wish that you had not said that Ape! he snarled fiercely You ought to know that theyre
the apple of the Great Eye But the winged Nazgl not yet not yet He wont let them
show themselves across the Great River yet not too soon Theyre for the Warand other purposes
Two chapters later Gandalf would confirm to Legolas directly the victim of his shot and
that the Nazgul would no longer resort to mere horses in the War of the Ring
The Winged Messenger! cried Legolas I shot at him with the bow of Galadriel above Sarn Gebir
and I felled him from the sky He filled us all with fear What new terror is this?
One that you cannot slay with arrows
said Gandalf You only slew his steed It was a good deed but the Rider was soon horsed again
For he was a Nazgl one of the Nine who ride now upon winged steeds
Chronologically Frodo Sam and Gollum are next to experience
a nazgul on its fell steed as they pass through the Dead Marshes
Then Frodo and Sam staring at the sky saw it come a small cloud flying from the accursed
hills a black shadow loosed from Mordor a vast shape winged and ominous It scudded
across the moon and with a deadly cry went away westward outrunning the wind in its fell speed
They fell forward grovelling heedlessly on the cold earth But the shadow of horror wheeled and
returned passing lower now right above them sweeping the fenreek with its ghastly wings
And then it was gone flying back to Mordor with the speed of the wrath of Sauron
and behind it the wind roared away leaving the Dead Marshes bare and bleak
Frodo and Sam got up But Gollum lay on the ground as if he had been stunned They roused him
with difficulty and for some time he would not lift his face but knelt forward on his elbows
covering the back of his head with his large flat hands
Wraiths! he wailed Wraiths on wings!
The Precious is their master They see everything everything
Nothing can hide from them Curse the White Face! And they tell Him everything He sees He knows
Ach gollum gollum gollum!
Again they experience a winged Nazgul but this time it was on other business
Frodo Sam and Gollum had not gone far before they felt once more the fear that had fallen on
them when the winged shape swept over the marshes They halted cowering on the evilsmelling ground
but the menace passed high overhead going maybe on some swift errand from Baraddr
Gandalf and the three hunters would go on to assist the Rohirrim in the Battle of Helms Deep
and then come to Isengard to parley with Saruman However on their way back to Edoras they would
once again feel the dread of the Winged Nazgul While reading the book this comes before Sam and
Frodos moment we discover that this is actually the same Nazgul making his way to Isengard
At that moment a shadow fell over them The bright moonlight seemed to be suddenly cut off
Several of the Riders cried out and crouched holding their arms above their heads as if to
ward off a blow from above a blind fear and a deadly cold fell on them Cowering they looked
up A vast winged shape passed over the moon like a black cloud It wheeled and went north flying
at a speed greater than any wind of Middleearth The stars fainted before it It was gone
Gandalf would face off against what Beregond of Gondor calls
hellhawks as Faramir is making his escape back to Minas Tirith
But now the dark swooping shadows were aware of the newcomer One wheeled towards him
but he raised his hand and from it a shaft of white light stabbed upwards
The Nazgl gave a long wailing cry and swerved away and with that the four others wavered
and then rising in swift spirals they passed away eastward
vanishing into the lowering cloud above and down on the Pelennor it seemed for a while less dark
The fell beasts we meet in The Lord of the Rings have beaks and claws They are featherless and
have batlike wings it is hinted that their heads are somewhat birdlike The most physical
description we get of these winged monstrosities comes later in The Return of the King
The great shadow descended like a falling cloud And behold! it was a winged creature if bird
then greater than all other birds and it was naked and neither quill nor feather did it bear
and its vast pinions were as webs of hide between horned fingers and it stank
A creature of an older world maybe it was whose kind lingering in forgotten mountains
cold beneath the Moon outstayed their day and in hideous eyrie bred this last untimely brood apt
to evil And the Dark Lord took it and nursed it with fell meats until it grew beyond the
measure of all other things that fly and he gave it to his servant to be his steed
It is this dreadful description of the winged shadow that precedes Theodens
fateful encounter with the Lord of the Nazgul
And one aspect that comes up in many of these quotes is the stench of the Fell Beasts  a
trait that understandably wasnt communicated as strongly in the films as the fear they inspire
The Witch King of Angmar rides his foul steed into the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and shoots
Theodens horse Snowmane with a dart crushing the king It is in this moment that Eowyn defends
her dying uncle and with a great swing of her sword decapitates the winged terror of Mordor
Once again Frodo and Sam witness the flight of a Nazgul March 15 but this time it
was not seeking for the ring or on a mission of Saurons but delivering tidings to the Dark Lord
and then they saw a shape moving at a great speed out of the West
at first only a black speck against the glimmering strip above the
mountaintops but growing until it plunged like a bolt into the dark
canopy and passed high above them
As it went it sent out a long shrill cry the voice of a Nazgul but this
cry no longer held any terror for them it was a cry of woe and dismay
ill tidings for the Dark Tower The Lord of the Ringwraiths had met his doom
The Winged Terrors are unleashed once again at the Battle of the Black Gate
However the great eagles would come to the battle
bearing down upon the Nazgul In that moment a terrible call emanated from the Dark Tower for
Frodo had claimed the one ring for his own and Sauron was aware the ring was now at Mount Doom
The Winged Nazgul move with all speed to Orodruin however they are too late
The ring is destroyed when Gollum slips into the fiery depths of the mountain
and in the ensuing eruption the Nazgul and their steeds are destroyed Never to return
We know now what happened to these winged beasts but what of their origin? This will be a theory
video for another day but I want to hear what you think Were they some descendant of dragons?
Or perhaps eagles that were mutilated into foul beasts bound to the dark lord?
were some other dreadful creature entirely twisted by Sauron
into their final monstrous form Let me know what you think in the comments!
Sitting on these train tracks
is a quarter million dollar Lamborghini
And barreling down at it
right now is a massive train
But before the impact Im giving this Lamborghini to Blake
And on top of sending the train
Im also gonna have these eight soldiers
shoot 10000 bullets at your Lamborghini
Thats the scariest thing Ive ever seen
Yeah its gonna be fun
And you have exactly 24 hours to build whatever you want
to protect your Lambo from the bullets
The timer starts now
Okay first line of defense
Im thinking a wall of cinder blocks after that
some shipping containers filled with refrigerators
and then basically just a wall of cars
to block those bullets
Do you think all of this is enough
to stop 10000 bullets?
I think it is Jimmy
Okay but so far nothings there
You should get to building
So Blake immediately drove to three stores
where I gave him my credit card
and he literally spent 78000 on supplies
And since I dont wanna bore you with all that lets skip
to the part where everything was delivered
This first round of supplies are starting to show up
Oh my God I cant believe I bought all this stuff
And this isnt even everything man
Hes got a water truck
Some of his junk cars came in
Hes got a CONEX crate over here
How did he get this much stuff? This is crazy
Dont worry about the guys with the machine guns
Just pretend theyre not there
Yeah I dont even know what
theyre doing there honestly
Were five hours in and this storage container
is about to be the first line of defense
against 10000 bullets
Alright thats probably good Thats probably good
Do you think that shipping containers
gonna stop any bullets?
Absolutely not
So as of now hes screwed
Yeah its not looking good for him
Oh gosh
Its been about six hours Are you happy with your progress?
Im very happy  You sure?
It wasnt until this thing got down
but now that its down dude I feel really good
I asked him if this would stop the bullets
and they said no
And once Blake realized he had to go all out
he works not only through the night
This way Mr Railroad ties
Nice nice Yes
Really nice Really nice
But even into the next morning
upgrading his defense
Dude hes stuffing the storage container with a van
and a giant tube!
And once I saw it put together
I was honestly pretty impressed
Run me through what you built
So I built a whole bunch of concrete in the front
and the tallest part of the wall is right in the center
to block the crows nest machine guns
cause those things are big and scary
I got all my cars in storage containers
and a bunch of water
And if you come right over here
youll see his Lamborghini tucked away amongst everything
There it is Nice and cozy
Do you think all of this will stop the bullets?
Yeah I do
I think you have a 50 chance of survival
Thats the best odds Ive had yet
And before I have them shoot 10000 rounds
come with me to the Lamborghini
Not only are you competing for this Lamborghini
but for a hundred grand as well
What?  Yes sir
Yeah thats pretty cool huh?
This will be enough to cover the insurance
24 hours is up!
Eight scary men 10000 bullets
Versus everything that Blake has built
Are you ready?
Just get it over with Im freaking out
Were locked and loaded Ready to fire on you Jimmy
Sir fire at will  Roger that
Oh!  Oh my god!
They are unloading on his fortress
Oh my God! This is crazy!
Theyre actually ripping through
the cinder blocks now
Oh man Oh god
Oh Blakes walls are crumbling right now!
And what we havent told Blake is these guns are only
the first of four phases weve designed
to destroy this Lamborghini
or should I say whatever remains after this?
They just brought up the LMG
Oh whoa!
Oh its melting!
Cinder blocks are falling!
All it takes is one bullet to penetrate
and its going in his Lambo
Oh my God!
These are the last bullets
Ten thousand!
All clear? Lets go
Please be safe Please be safe
How is it?!
Shes clean baby!
Whoo! 10000 rounds and not one connection baby
Theres no bullet holes in your Lamborghini
And if you dont already know who Blake is
hes actually a contestant from our previous two videos
But today hes back for a third
and final attempt to win the grand prize
Are you ready for phase two?
See that giant crane coming?
That big yellow oil rig looking thing?
That is phase two
That crane is going to lift your car up a hundred feet
and then in 24 hours drop it
And you have to catch it without it being destroyed
Yeah Alright bring it over here!
And while we prepared the worlds first 100 foot
Lamborghini free fall
There goes your Lamborghini Blake!
Blake began to strategize on how he was going to catch it
I have no idea what Im gonna do
Chandler come over here
Yes Im here
How would you break its fall?
So you get all the pillows in the city
Step two get all the mattresses next get a blanket
Chandler youre just making a giant bed
Then a warm glass of milk
All right stop Youre not helping
Blake work your magic
Im screwed
Alright guys I got some good news and bad news
We passed day one with flying colors
The bad news is the Lamborghini is airborne
Okay? So anyone got any ideas?
I mean yeah hit me like what do we think?
The bouncy castles  Bouncy castles
That thats actually not that bad
Just becausethats not bad at all really
And after being inspired
by the construction workers wisdom
Blake had decided on his master plan
I would like to move the CONEXes in like a square
right here with the X in the middle
And that way I can just fill the square up with a bunch
of air mattresses pillows bubble wrap
and on top it all off with a bunch of bouncy castles
Just the biggest problem right now is I have no material
Everything that I bought is hard concrete or metal
And nothing that I bought I can use for day two
So I have absolutely nothing
And so Blake sent his crew to buy every pillow
and air mattress in the city
And even though he was incredibly sleep deprived
he got to work
Im already at the stage where its like Wait
why am I doing this again?
Oh yeah thats right Im in a challenge for a Lamborghini
thats floating in the sky right now
By the time his materials had arrived
Blake had been awake for over 24 hours
and was in desperate need of sleep
Im gonna try to get some sleep
cause Im exhausted and its four in the morning
And with how exhausted Blake was
he ended up sleeping for way longer than he planned
Is he serious?
What is this?
He got mattresses pillows and blankets
But hes missing the warm milk
Yeah thats the key to everything
Where is Blake?
Hes asleep I heard
No he is not
By the time Blake got on site
it was already super late in the day
Thats Blakes truck pulling up
Alright we need to get to work Come on!
Alright lets just see what this looks like
Oh that bouncy house works as a big box
So Im thinking maybe we put that thing in the middle now
and then we start blowing it up
Only four and a half hours remain
and its not looking good for Blake
I dont think he has more than a 10 chance
of catching a Lamborghini
And even if he does theres no shot hes stopping
that train later on
Start filling up the side so that way its high over here
takes away this wall
So with only a couple of hours remaining
Blake did all that he could by filling the rest of his pit
with cardboard boxes and bubble wrap
Its coming down to the wire
Chandler how much time is left?
One hour
Blake is screwed
I have a little bit of bubble wrap left
I think Im just gonna get raised on this thing
and just wrap my baby up in this bubble wrap
and Im good to go
Thats definitely gonna help
Blake spent what little time he had remaining
on this crane failing at trying to bubble wrap his car
Its just not gonna work
You know what time it is?
Time to drop the car Lets drop this by boy
The failed bubble wrap makes it look majestic
Blake do you think your Lamborghini will survive?
Im positive Jimmy
He is more certain than me
Im positive about this one
I bought every air mattress at Walmart
If this wont catch it I dont know what will
I did everything I can
Heres a Feastables bar Blake
Ah thank you Mr
That way even if you lose the car
at least you have some good chocolate
Its available at Walmart Be sure to go try our new bar
Im so curious what you think
But anyway you have three bouncy castles 150 mattresses
how many pillows?  150
150 pillows and 2000 cardboard boxes!
Will it break the Lamborghinis fall?
Yes Yes
Thats two yeses  Okay
24 hours of work down to this no pun intended
3 2 1 Drop the Lamborghini!
Here we go! Outta my way!
That did not sound good
Please be okay Please be okay Please be okay
Please be okay
Alright Hes moving the CONEX crate out the way
Theres no way you caught that Lambo
Get these boxes outta the way!
Whoa!  What?
Were about to find out how damaged this car is
The lights work
Ooh the lights work
Yeah This princess castle might have
saved this entire car
Moment of truth
You mightve been the first person in history
to catch a Lamborghini
If it turns on
Alright here we go Here we go Here we go
Whoa it works!
I cant believe it! Yay!
Thats what Im talking about! Shes alive!
Everything looks good minus a little crack in the bumper
which we found out via official appraiser
This was only going to reduce the price
of Blakes Lamborghini by
Probably 10 grand
Thank you so much Thanks for the good news
Right nows the perfect time to mention that Phase three
is flaming cars
For Blakes next challenge
were bringing back his biggest nightmare
We have recreated the flaming cars challenge
that costed Blake everything last time
Wow thats a low blow
But seeing that hes done this before
were gonna up the stakes by dropping twice
as many cars as last time
Ill see you tomorrow  I got a lot to prove
Redemption day!
Blake spent the rest of the night disassembling his
defense for phase two
And after a good night of sleep he was ready
to begin his defense for phase three
Its eight in the morning
Just woke up We got a lot of work to do today
So lets get started
Heres the day three plan
Im gonna cut the bottom out of a shipping container
Im gonna drop it right on the car
Next Im gonna take two more containers
and Im gonna lead them up coming
to a point right above the car
And most importantly nothing flammable this time
Do you think that will deflect a car?
Yes sir
Oh I thought you were gonna say no
Blake then asked his crew to remove every piece of wood
that was in the container
because thats what ended his challenge last time
He then had them cut out the bottom of the container
that would surround the Lamborghini
The storage container could put a lot of damage
Completely crush it?  Yeah
It can?
I mean yeah that thing weighs a whole lot
And with that being done Blake just needs
to lower the container carefully over the Lamborghini
without damaging it
One scratch can cost some thousands of dollars
Youre good just like that?
It is so close to scraping the car
Watch your fingers Were coming down!
Yes! Yes!
I cannot believe that!
Next were gonna bring these containers together
to form a V
What if the car gets caught in there?
Yeah thats that cant happen dude
Thats why were putting this pointy thing at the top
Do you think that will actually deflect our car?
A hundred percent
20 minutes remain and then we see if that Lamborghini
perishes just like his 500 grand
And as usual Blake utilized every last second
3 2 1
Not quite sure what that dirt accomplished
Time is up  No!
Lets see if unlike last time you survive phase three
you lost 500000 from this exact challenge
How are you feeling?
I feel pretty confident
I think the viewers wanna know one thing
Did you put wood inside of there like last time?
A little bit
No Im just kidding Theres no wood in there
It was one of the biggest mistakes
Ive ever made in my life
Moment of truth Come on in
Three shipping containers
A bunch of dirt concrete
a weird like pointed roof thing
Versus 10 flaming cars!
Lets go dude
Light it on fire!
Will Blake be one step closer to going home
with the new Lamborghini filled
with a hundred thousand dollars or be eliminated
and go home with nothing?
Were about to find out
Drop it!
Oh oh!
Oh You did not want that
I feel like thats exactly what he didnt want to happen
Oh no
Still feeling good?
Not as good
Yeah this is giving me some flashbacks
Its giving you some flashbacks
Alright ready for the next one?
Lets do it Lets do it
Drop it
Oh my God the roof looks like its already buckling
And just in case Blake loses the flaming cars
like last time Im gonna take this moment
and tell you about this amazing new phone
What youre currently watching on is
the new Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra
This phone can record slowmo in 4K
The camera on this is crazy
Were like 200 feet away and its nighttime
And look at that crystal clear
Ho ho ho ho!  And go ahead and drop it
Oh that hurt to watch
It also has a ton of new features
with Galaxy AI like Photo Assist
Remember the last challenge when the bumper
got cracked on the Lambo?
You can just circle it like this
and then all you do is you hit that eraser button
And just like that the bumper is fixed
Now I have a new car
For the picture you do
Whenever youre ready
This phone also has circle to search Google
which makes finding information incredibly easy
It wouldve helped Blake a lot in the last video
to learn about the flammability of wooden railroad ties
All he needed to do was long press the home button
highlight the railroad ties and ask Is this flammable?
As you can see railroad ties are flammable
You wouldve learned the answer instantly
Could have just told you
I was genuinely impressed
by this phone and I think you will be too
So go to samsungcom click the link in the description
or scan this QR code to check it out right now
and lets drop the next car
We dropped car after car
and with each one we could tell Blake
was getting more nervous but we also noticed that all
of the impacts were starting
to damage the crate itself
Your crate on the bottom is bowing
At this point the container protecting
the Lambo was being crushed by the weight
and heat of the cars
I thought about this every day since
the last time I saw this
And now its time for the final car!
Oh no!
Bro its gotta be a thousand degrees in there!
This cars probably melting right now
We got the fire extinguisher
Somehow hes running so fast Be careful Blake
Im coming
How is it?
Its okay Its okay!
Yes! You like that?
If one more car was dropped this crate
wouldve collapsed
You stopped 10000 bullets  Easy
You caught a car out of mid air
Youve now deflected ten flaming cars
Now its time for phase four
Bring on the train
The timer has officially started
I gotta go
Good luck on phase four
God speed
What is he even running at?
Blake knew that the train was going
to be the most deadly attack yet
so he wasted no time in getting started
I think the best way to stop a train is to derail it
Thats what Ive tried to build here
All these railroad ties are tucked snug
and all of these are gonna go under the train
The trains gonna hit em like that
And if I do that a hundred more times
I dont see the train just blowing past all that
The railroad ties lost me the challenge last video
This time theyll save me
I just need two inches off the track and I win
Two inches is a lot though
My man
And then once I have all this done
I can just put concrete on top
I think thats gonna work man I think thats gonna work
Blake worked with his crew throughout
the entire night and when I showed up the next morning
it was obvious that this challenge had taken a toll on him
Whats up Jimbo?
What happened to your voice?
Im like dying out here
As you guys know he lost 250000 in this video
He lost half a million dollars in this video
I think Blake is sick and tired of losing
He has an army going super hard
Theyre currently stacking the cars
that we dropped on phase three on the train tracks
But time was still ticking down
And in order to stop this train and take his Lambo home
Blake began adding a lot more objects
to the tracks like shipping containers mattresses
to cushion the impact
Blakes worked so hard Im now on his team
And water tanks
Blake really seems to know what hes doing
Too bad theres only 11 minutes left
At this point Blake did everything he could
to finish his build before time ran out
and it was actually starting to look impressive
This is it  Three
The final stretch
Two one  Last line of defense
Times up Stop Turn it off
Turn it off
Time is officially up!
Oh my God
From phase one shipping containers phase twos
mattresses and even phase threes burning cars
Blake you somehow used all the resources
from the previous phases
Lets see if youre driving home in a Lamborghini
or if Im dropping you off at your house
Bring that train on man Bring it on
Before we ram everything we need to back the train up
Were gonna go really far back
That way the train can pick up a lot of speed
before it hits everything Sounds like a good idea?
No that sounds awful
Be honest Blake Do you think
your Lamborghini will survive?
God I hope so Jimmy
And of course we had to put the Feastables logo
on the train
Its the best chocolate on earth
Do yourself a favor and try the new formula
but for now its time for the biggest moment
of Blakes life
Lets see if he wins a Lamborghini
Blake any last words?
Give it all you got
Send the train
Here it comes
Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God
Its coming!
Its gonna speed up until it hits 35 miles an hour
right before impact
Dude it is going quick!
Its just gonna derail Its just gonna derail
Here she comes!
Lets see if it was all worth it!
Oh wait wait wait!
Blake it derailed!  Wait I think it stopped!
Blake Ive never seen someone this happy!
Oh wow you derailed it!
Oh my God Oh my God I did it!
This is your new Lamborghini Blake!
Not only did he win the Lamborghini
but he also got all this money!
I did it!
You wanna know the best way to end this video Blake?
By them going to Walmart and buying Feastables right now
Its the best tasty chocolate on the planet
Third times the charm See you guys later!
For thousands of years

We cant do it
We couldnt before but we can now

Just getting dropped by the flying cool guy
Hes dumping man
Theres no way thats real
I refuse  Flying bike!

No way! Is this actually a flying car?
No  This is so cool
Is that spinny thing usually on the front?
The propeller?  Yeah
Yeah usually Except for this is a flying car
That is so cool
Im gonna go rob a bang and then just get away with this
Bravo to whoever built that
First I thought that was a real person
Its a plasma torch style lightsaber
AKA lightsaber
Hack Smith please let me use it
I meant to reach out to him
to ask if we could borrow his lightsaber
I think I forgot though
You should remember to do something like that
Look at this
You forgot this?
If we had this when we were doing the bounty hunter video
it wouldve been over instantly
What would you have done if I had somehow contacted
Yeah Oh yeah when I was stuck in the save
And you had that? Oh!  Yeah
I mean I just wouldve ran out the secret door faster
Its the drone
Its the pizza delivery drone
Youre telling me theres pizza drone?
Yes I want this in my neighborhood
It gives you your little pizza
and it keeps it warm in the pizza warmer
Whoa!  Oh get pushed over
You stupid robot
A dog!
Do you want robots to take over?
How about you stop being an idiot?
Jimmy? Hes getting up
It was the one thing robots were never able to do
They can do it now
They can get up
Oh you pushed me down?

This looks like a sad scene from a movie
Jimmy?  Yes Chris
I found your car
You need this

Friends when you imagine the Middle East
you probably think of deserts
But Oman is quite special
It has date palm forests
and tall mountains
Here you can swim with turtles
and in Oman you can also see
one of the most dangerous forts in the world
A fort that could never be breached by an enemy
Because its defence system was so immaculate
that youll be shocked to see it
The security system of this fort
was truly amazing back then
If you tried to enter the fort from this gate
the soldiers could throw rocks from above to k!ll you
So even before you enter
you can see the first post
from where they would throw rocks on you
If you escape this
you will reach the Pitfall 1
where they would throw hot oil or date syrup on you
The date syrup
Thats where the hot oil would be poured on you
So you better be quick to escape it
Now theyve covered this with glass
or else you could have fallen into the pit
When you would run from the hot oil
you would fall into this pit
And if you escaped it too
you would reach the Pitfall 2
They could drop something from here
the Mrder Hole 2 is right above it
You could fall into this pit and perish
Catch enemies off guard
in the dark passageway
It was dark
there were no lamps like here
So some of the stairs had wooden planks
that could be removed to expose
deep gaping pits
And then you would be at the third pitfall
And the fourth after that
And the fifth
So not just once but
you would have to escape five times
if you want to breach this fort
Weve safely escaped 2 pitfalls
Lets move on to the third pitfall
Oh! This is the third pitfall
As soon as you open this door
you have this door here
as soon as you step through it  youll fall into the pitfall
Theres a door before every pitfall
These people were so clever
the doors would be closed
and when you try to open the doors
they will pour oil on you
and if you manage to open it
you will fall into the pit
And after passing through all these stages
I dont know if there has  been a single intruder in history
who reached the top
If he did
this is the view he would have seen
These are the places
from where you would pour the hot oil
It can really go deep inside
300 years ago
Nizwa was the capital of Oman
Thats why today
Nizwa is an important tourist attraction
The city of Nizwa
And this fort
back then the Sultan of Oman
lived here and ruled over Oman
The best thing about Oman
in comparison to the other Middle Eastern countries
is that this is a sparsely populated country
Wherever you go there wont be a crowd
Youll see very few people
So you can take your time to explore everything
Like you can see the fort
this is a major tourist attraction
but you can hardly see anyone else here
Im the guy who has been assigned
the duty of throwing the stones today
Oh youre throwing the stones today?
On the intruders
Okay Ill be the one who pours the oil then
Ill be over here okay?
The wood on the door
this is the same wood from those days
This is walnut wood
Even in their shooting style
they had some nice designs
Like if someone was close to the fort
and they had to shoot him
this is the slit theyd use
so that they could shoot downwards
But if the target was far
this is the hole for that
they could shoot from here
And theres another angle here
So they could shoot in three different angles
These 3 angles were all around 360 of the fort
So you can imagine the
level of protection of this fort
Theres a well in this castle fort
Look at how deep it goes
You can see my reflection at the bottom
Oh my God Zoom in
This is a big area
that includes the Nizwa Souq Nizwa Fort
a historical wall
that was used to protect the fort from enemies
Were walking on this wall now
You can see some old buildings here
some parts are being renovated
some have been renovated already
But look at how extraordinary it looks
It feels like you have timetravelled  to 2000 years into the past
Dont be distracted by my cap
theres Australia written on it
I wore this because I didnt have any other caps
And its too sunny here
And if you remember the Australia vlogs
I got this cap for free in Australia
so Im wearing this cap
After this we went to the Nizwa Souq
The old city market
that looks like a historical place
Omani dates
Look at the varieties here
Less sweets ones okay
There are dates everywhere
You will know the difference  between this one and that
This ones good right? I like this
I think this is the fourth variety Ive tried
At home mostly we have the Medjool ones
There are more than 200 varieties of dates in Oman
They have so many types of dates in this shop
Youll be exhausted by the time youve tried them all
They have seedless dates
date honey
and the tahini sauce to dip the dates
This machine is making sesame sauce
The sesame seeds are put into it
And this machine is grinding the seeds
to make the sauce
You can see it here
And the sauce then drips into this pot  where it is collected
Oh wow theres so much sauce
You can smell it also
They have given us this sample to try
Pure tahini sauce
It is warm!
The contrast between  this sauce and the dates
tastes quite good
because it tastes a bit sour
and the dates are sweet
So when the tastes mix
it makes a good snack
So we decided to buy 1 packet of dates
But they actually gifted it to us
They would not accept any payment
Very very sweet
Though it was pretty affordable to be honest
0800 Rial 208 or 17235
800 Baiza
A Rial is divided into 1000 Baiza
This dagger that you see here
this is the logo of Oman
Even on Omans flag
theres a dagger in a corner
In ceremonies and special occasions
people carry such daggers
If you are interested in visiting Oman
you can try Gainwell Travel
they offer customised travel itineraries and packages
of many places including Oman
The link to their website is in the description
You can check it out
So this is a banana  and a palm tree plantation
You can see were walking on the irrigation system
so we dont wanna step on anything
There are no dates on any of these trees
but when they are they look like this
They grow in bunches
There can be more than a thousand dates in a bunch
Omans population is less than 5 million
But there are more than 7 million date palm trees
Can you imagine that
there are more date trees  than people in this country?
There was a small hill here
The view from here is simply amazing
You can see the date palm tree  plantation spread over this area
And behind it you can see  some interesting historical civilisations
We finished checking into the second hotel now
and as soon as we entered the room
look at what we found
A huge YouTube cake
Welcome to Al Bustan Palace
Thats the name of this hotel
And they have my latest photo on  top of this YouTube cake
Probably edible
And the Play Button Subscribe
wait a second Dislike?
No no no lets remove the Dislike
Dislike also? We dont need it here
These cakes look really interesting
They look really good
But unfortunately its not  possible to eat so much sugar
its just too much
If you take an hourlong speedboat ride from Muscat
you will reach Al Daymaniyat Island
It is a protected nature reserve
and a wonderful site for ecotourism
So were on the beautiful island now
Were the only ones on this island
The only ones? Look theres no one else around here
Were about to go snorkelling Yeah
Theres a small problem
Someone one of us I wont say who
forgot their swimming pants
So they have to go in undie
Underwater youll find more than  100 species of corals
more than 280 species of fish
but if the thing this place is most famous for
are the turtles
The endangered species of green turtles
often come here to nest
and while snorkelling
these turtles can get very close to you
In this video you can see
that they arent scared of humans
Now were at a special museum in Oman
The building is so unique that
Im in a sciencefiction movie
Not in 2024 but in 2124
It looks so crazy
Look behind you
This building feels like its AIgenerated
Its so perfect
Everything looks so proper
you wont even find a single  dust particle on this floor
This is the biggest museum in Oman
Oman Across the Ages
The museum building is so huge that
there is more than 900000 m of exhibition space here
And in some galleries the ceiling is so high
some are more than 20m high
The huntergatherers who lived in Oman 6000 years ago
lived in such huts
These are some historical  Omani sea routes over here
Look at this the screen is so big
but there are gaps between the screen
To go further into the museum
you can pass through the gaps in the screen
This museum has been designed very creatively
Theres another screen on the other side
Friends here you can clearly see
the Omani national emblem
That has two swords and a dagger
This is the passport of Omans previous Sultan
You can see it
Along with his Drivers License and ID Card
You can see the number on the ID Card
Most of the things that you saw in this vlog
were from around Muscat
But apart from this in Oman you can see deserts
the highest mountain in the Gulf
as well as the Gulfs Grand Canyon
We showed the Grand Canyon in the previous vlog

Is this Bhabhis conspiracy?
Does Bhabhi wants him to leave the channel?
Was Bhabhi always plotting?
Was this Bhabhis plan?
Was this her conscious plan?
Yesterday Gaurav Taneja aka Flying Beast was arrested by the Noida Police
He was arrested on the basis of these two sections visible on your screen
Will discuss whether this arrest was right or wrong
What this tells us
well talk about it and decode whether the arrest was fine or not
But before that lets understand a few things What is Vlogging?
Show our life by holding camera?
Why does one do vlogging?
If something interesting is happening in your life
then you give a chance to the people in your life to peek
You must have seen that we are more interested in the life of others than our own
When we give this glimpse to others
then it is a source of entertainment for them
and for those bloggers there is a chance to get fame and create an influence
a chance to create an influence
Nowadays it also becomes a huge career option
Many times we also create such influence which benefits socially also do great things
I will also talk about those great things
must watch this video till the end
Before this video I asked all of you in a community post that
what do you get to learn from vloggers?
Got interesting reactions
I would highly recommend commenting through this post and read the comments
If you have any interesting observation then you must also comment
I would love to react to this on my Instagram
Earn money by telling the personal matter outside
How to show off your big house?
Tell me I am poor
Teach to speak Guys loudly
How to auction the privacy of the house in public?
To go to jail
Flying the dog by tying it to a balloon
They teach that the car can be rented
Is it wrong to earn money by vlogging like this from YouTube?
I dont think this is wrong
So many people who are in various positions
they earn so much money through corruption through cheating
earn a lot of money through manipulation
then a person by working hard
Means that when you are a small vlogger you dont have a team
you edit yourself and big vloggers also edit themselves
So I dont think there is any mistake if you are entertaining someone by working so hard
The mistake is when you set the wrong example in your vlog due to wrong influence
encouraging people to do wrong actions
It is wrong to show fake lifestyle in the name of content
Making people feel zealousy and being absolutely fake and overly sweet
showing so many good things that I think its not possible
Sometimes people go fake I think he is wrong
And making mistakes one after the other and not learning anything from that mistake
not acknowledging and admitting mistake
and not telling audience that Ive made a mistake and making many mistakes in a row
Whats not wrong?
It is not wrong when your mistake has happened for the first time
or the situation becomes such that that thing looks wrong
It is not wrong when you do a lot of such things which are not discussed in the media
but when you make a mistake or someone misguides you
and there are thousands of discussions about that thing
When you are socially aware channel your influence towards social initiatives too
that is not wrong
Teach people something with your content
Something similar happened with Flying Beast
Such an incident has happened to him
which must have happened for the first time in his vlogging career
So Ritu Bhabhi thought that I will make Flying Beasts birthday in the metro
She gave invitation to all 7 million people to come to Sector 51 Noida
Tomorrow is Gauravs birthday
And I have planned such a wonderful surprise
I have booked the entire metro for him
Will make his birthday there with all of you
This is a surprise and dont put any story by tagging him
You all come and well have a lot of fun
Tomorrow130 pm Sector 51 Noida
Im sure all these 7 million people are not only from Noida
but also from Delhi Gurgaon Ghaziabad Faridabad and may be from some other state also
How will these people let such an opportunity pass that too on Saturday?
A crowd gathered there
There the traffic stopped
whether it was an ambulance whether someone had an emergency going to office or school
whether someone was going for any emergency they all stopped there
were restrained which was not intentional unintentional
but they were restrained and thats why this section is applicable
You must be aware about the Covid situation for which this section is applicable
but it has also been violeted
Whether it happened intentionally or unintentionally
here Flying Beast is wrong Ritu Rathi is wrong or not lets discuss
Lets talk first why would she have done this?
The first reason that might have come to your mind as well
Is this Bhabhis conspiracy? No!
Does Bhabhi wants him to leave the channel? No!
Was Bhabhi always plotting? No!
Was this Bhabhis plan? No!
No if it was Ekta Kapoors serial then it would have happened
but obviously theres nothing like that
I think Ritu Bhabhi did this because she genuinely wanted to give back something
or may be wanted to make his 36th birthday memorable
so she did that out of pure genuinity and innocent emotion
But what I expect from Ritu
is being more mature because obviously shes captain shes educated
she knows about law
I hope she know So this is tricky!
And Ill judge this thing on 5 grounds in a little while
But before that lets talk about what other reasons can be that Ritu Bhabhi did this
First obviously she wanted to make his birthday special
I think she was misguided!
Obviously Ritu bhabhi would have reached out
to people agencies management agencies that how we can do this
May be that idea was a misguidance!
She must have been misguided that this can be managed
There should be something different
You know Gaurav and Ritu never did any kind of controversies
There are many vloggers who get views by doing controversy
I react to controversy because it is my content
because I want to give perspective what is right what is wrong
who is manipulating you and who is not
But this is not the content of Ritu and Gaurav
There are many people whose content is not like this yet those people do
But Gaurav never did that
He has make this vlogging channel purely on the basis of merit
I dont think it was a publicity stunt
The psychology of vloggers is to do something different
and to make it different it happened!
And whoever has this misguidance we should pay attention to it
I will talk about that too but the third reason that why she would have done this
Psychology of vloggers is to do something different and make it big it may be
As a vlogger psychology challenges you
stuck on this particular number of what to do something different
stuck on this subscriber base and now how to go ahead
how to do something big and something new
How should we return the love back to the audience
I think all this problem has happened because of it
Now lets talk whether he should have been arrested or not
I would like to discuss this thing on five grounds
First  Awareness
Did they know about these sections?
Section 144 Covid situation
I believe so
Gaurav is IIT graduated and both are captains
Now Gaurav is also studying Law so I should believe
There was awareness
Now coming to the context
Get carried away by emotions She got carried away in emotions
Im making tea after that Im going to get ready
See you at 130 Bye!
Third  Intent!
Was it her intention that people should suffer?
Was it their intention that we dont care about law and order as some people are saying
I dont think so
But yes there intent was to do something big
Im 100 sure about it Atleast from whatever perspective
But to do something big that was their intent
Fourth  Pattern
Is it their pattern to do all this? No!
As we discussed there was no pattern
But there is one thing even though Gaurav and Ritu did not have a pattern
but all our political parties do
Whatever the situation was they did it
Theyve done it in much bigger numbers
But if someone else does all this and they are not punished
then does it make you right? I dont think so
If someone else is making a mistake do you get a license to make a mistake?
I dont think so!
So even on this basis I wouldnt give them any point
Even if their pattern is not there but there is a mistake
Last but not he least is Responsibilty
Was this a responsible act? No!
This was not a responsible act at all  Because if we talk about health
talk about covid talk about safety talk about law and order
then it was absolutely wrong and irresponsible act
Because with great powers comes great responsibility
If this is the first mistake then it can be forgiven
But this mistake has to be acknowledged has to be discussed
so that other mistakes dont happen
Because as part of my content I always talk about
where creator gone wrong in our Where creator gone wrong series
So thisb  time this creator has gone wrong specially Bhabhi
Specially when you talk about 241 Wrongful Restraint!
How many ambulances would be there how many people would be in emergency
when those people are upset then there is a mistake
I think there were many such risks in this case which should have been forsee
Anyone who is misguiding
Shouldnt have been agreed to him so soon
But whether Ritu Bhabhi and Flying Beast should have been arrested or not
then they were arrested it was right but they got bail that was also right
But my question is how many more people who should have been arrested in this
This is the whole process of approval when Bhabhi booked a metro coach
under whom does the metro come?
The approval which is given is given on whose basis whose approval is involved
what is its escalation process when approval is given
then who interprets its repurcations
Should the police be notified or not and by whom?
Should the agency be arrested?
Should any government official be fined on the one who gave the approval?
Is this the result of inefficiency?
Is this the result of negligence?
Is this matter only the result of the negligence of Ritu and Gaurav or of many other administrations?
Is our administration useless?
These are many questions that need to be asked
And it also has to be asked that what happens when these political rallies happen?
But at the same point of time I dont want to give creators excuse
If it happens we can do it too No you cant
If a person is doing wrong things then you cannot
If someone else is selling tobacco
then its fine their principles are different
But it doesnt give you the liense to do the same mistake
And what is happening it is not necessary that it is right
And accepting what has been happening because it is happening like this is also wrong
So thats why we shouldnt accept and just take this as an excuse
The reason is simple guys
There is collective irresponsibilty
There should be a collective penalty
on all those departments which are involved in this everyone should be punished
Media shouldnt just focus on one person
it should focus on entire process and the chain of events  linked to that
That would be my submission guys!

post his arrest and the subsequent bail
youtuber gaurav tanija aka flying beast
shared hilarious memes made by his fans
on his social media page
the social media influencer was arrested
after his fans gathered outside sector
51 metro station to celebrate his
birthday on saturday
most of the memes made by his fans on
the incident were either about his
fitness or his wife rituarati
one of them mentioned that not
restacking the weights was his crime
while another one spoke about how
unbothered he is even after getting
taneja also tweeted that he is not
afraid of getting slapped but of his
wifes surprises thereby teasing his
wife ritu rathi taneja apart from the
memes gaurav also shared a family
picture with his wife ritu and his two
daughters on instagram and took a dig at
ritu as he wrote thank you for all the
lovely wishes you guys made my day also
thanks to riturathi for making it the
most memorable birthday literally
ritu rathi taneja on the occasion of her
husbands birthday invited his fans to
celebrate his birthday with them at a
metro station in noida post which gaurav
taneja was arrested for breaching
section 144 which is in place in noida
gaurav was arrested on saturday and was
taken to noida sector 49 police station
for questioning post which he was
granted bail
maybe we should just settle this
but where
oh i know
how about up there
oh you must pardon me
i forgot you have no way of making it up
to that divine beast on your own
actually scratch that one for now link
canonically cannot jump upwards
infinitely lets not be silly here
yet you have no way of making it up to
that divine balloons
link fueled by rivalis reverse
psychology scoured the land sending the
octorocks of hyrule to near extinction
for their balloons wielding a korok leaf
and mounting a trusty wooden box he set
with patience and precision links
dangerous excursion upwards leads him
straight to rivali on vonnetto
to accept his oneonone challenge and
then kick his ass hypothetically
unfortunately in my demonstrations
vomitto doesnt come with collision
link did not have the paraglider back
then but it wouldnt be a stretch to say
he could make one
and with that
chaining together a series of spicy
peppers in order to create an updraft
even taller than rivales gale
cant reach high enough this gets left
out as an honorable mention
okay this method requires the sheikah
slate which was in the possession of
zelda 100 years ago
but hypothetically speaking lets say
link was
fueled by reverse psychology
this is the sheikah slate eh
he steals it enters oman aw shrine as
the swords chosen one gets magnesis and
constructs his own flying machine out of
two mine carts to go kick rivalis ass
stealing the sheikah slate and exploring
ancient chica structures for power is
the norm now do you want to prove your
volley right no you have stasis now a
paraglider you constructed yourself and
a pretty metal box youre ready to hit
yourself really hard with to prove a
get a fairy youll be fine climb to
hebrew peak build up enough kinetic
energy to kill a henox hit yourself with
it and glide over to valmeado to kick
rivallis ass
how did link get a wooden box on top of
hebra peak
i dont know he built it with all of his
wood or something
with similar disregard for ones own
body a wellplaced bomb with this light
wooden box can send link far and fast
enough to reach valmeado and kick
rivallis butt
do you need a butthole to have a butt
i dont know the full anatomy of a rito
but if we assume theyre like other
birds he has a cloaca
but does that meet the specifications of
a button
then link kicks him in the cloaca
that doesnt have the same ring to it
sometimes theres just a single moment
the straw that breaks the camels back
the burning rage in your soul unlocks
your potential
to do
the impossible
were disregarding the laws of physics
rocks no more than you can fathom
study them empathize with them shift
your values to theirs
and with new understanding
you may become untethered to the earth
and were back its the moon jump glitch
i cant explain this one immersively you
mount a horse you mount a different
horse and then everything is wacky
link makes it to varmetto
rivali is in disbelief this isnt
in a moment where his insecurity should
have been reinforced
the act is dropped
and he confesses his feelings for link
after all these years i simply must
admit the truth
they embrace
forever sealing the darkness of their
bitter history into the past
the true darkness
that which holds true love from
ride to the highest peak of hebrew
create a time split and instruct your
split self to ride back to rito staple
position their steed on a slope facing
away from the divine beast
and remount to tether your alternate

In September of 2009 a critical event unfolded in the rugged terrains of the Shuryak Valley
in Kunar province Afghanistan
A powerful Blackhawk helicopter on its mission to rescue wounded Marines found itself under
intense fire from Taliban militiamen
The situation on the ground was dire the defending forces were outnumbered and the
Blackhawks position became increasingly perilous amid the escalating firefight
In this tense moment pilot Patrick Benson made a sudden and unexpected appearance in
the most surprising of helicopters barely suited for the situation
His Bell OH58 typically used for light reconnaissance entered the fray
Despite its compact size the OH58 was no stranger to combat
It could be armed with an array of weapons including Stinger airtoair missiles a 50caliber
machine gun podded 70mm Hydra rockets and AGM114 Hellfire airtoground missiles
It was a bold move and Benson drew the enemys fire towards the small helicopter risking
his life to protect the wounded Marines
The OH58 took several hits with its nose being punctured by small arms fire injuring
both Benson and his copilot
Despite his injuries Benson persisted in his efforts ensuring the Blackhawk could
safely evacuate the area
This act of bravery and dedication to his fellow soldiers would later earn Benson and
his copilot the accolades they rightly deserved
Moreover this incident showcased the resilience and dependability of the OH58 aptly nicknamed
the Kiowa Warrior
The Ugly Duckling Following the success of the Americanmade
helicopters deployed during the Far East campaigns of World War 2 the military envisioned and
developed several types of rotary wing aircraft tailored for different uses
Besides providing transport for troops and carrying supplies for logistical support
such as the Korean War era Sioux or the future Chinook helicopters began to be employed
for retrieving other helicopters and aircraft and even delivering artillery and ground vehicles
across difficult terrain
Others such as the future Bell AH1 Cobra would find their purpose as gunships armed
to the teeth ready to provide immediate fire support to allied ground troops and effectively
decimate the enemy
As American involvement in Vietnam increased the United States Navy commenced looking for
a replacement for the Bell OH13 Sioux and Hiller OH23 Raven for the reconnaissance
Both helicopters had been successfully used during the Korean War for MEDVAC or medical
However they struggled with their piston engines offering a maximum output of 250
shaft horsepower
On behalf of the Army the US Navy approached over 20 helicopter manufacturers for the submission
of proposals for a Light Observation Helicopter or LOH
The designs had to be powered by an Allison 250C20B free turbine engine and their primary
role was to be the eyes in the skies for military intelligence
Besides reconnaissance the rotarywing aircraft had to be capable of ground attack transport
and medical evacuation roles
Of the twelve helicopter manufacturers that entered the competition only three were shortlisted
Bell presented the YOH4A or Model 206 Hughes the YOH6A Model 369 and Hiller the YOH5A
Bell produced five prototypes of its helicopter that were tested thoroughly in 1962
During its maiden flight Army and Navy personnel referred to the YOH4A as the Ugly Duckling
when compared to the competitors
It was not a good omen
Ranger to the Rescue After testing the Bell Hiller and Hughes
helicopters the Army ultimately settled for the Hughes OH6 Cayuse Loach in May
Despite the Armys decision Dave Ostrowski an Army aeronautical engineer in the LOH contest
said in issue 10 of Take Off magazine that Bells model QUOTE Sprang off the ground
like a homesick angel
It had power speed and maneuverability
It felt good
It was a super ship to fly
Nevertheless it was not over yet for Bell
They knew their helicopter had potential and the company decided to market it for civilian
But first the engineers had to redesign the Ugly Duckling to attract customers
The displeasing bubble face canopy and small fuselage had to be reshaped to be easier on
the eye provide more space for the cramped quarters of the three passengers and ample
cargo space
In January 1966 Bell presented a redesigned fuselage and dubbed the new helicopter the
Model 206A Jet Ranger
The fuselage was more aesthetically pleasing added over 16 cubic feet of cargo space for
luggage and made the passenger compartment more pleasing providing enough space for
up to five people
Furthermore the Jet Ranger was also modified internally
It was now powered by a 317 horsepower Allison 250C18 engine
The Ranger had its maiden flight the same month and experienced no issues
It became a best seller in the coming months becoming a familiar sight around the United
The Jet Ranger was adopted by the government forest services law enforcement news broadcasters
and tour companies
Bells Jet Ranger became so recognizable that even Italian manufacturer Agusta acquired
the production rights to fly the Jet Ranger over the skies of Europe
In January 1968 Bell scored big when the Jet Ranger was solicited by the US Navy to
come up with a modified variant for flight training
Over 40 TH57 Sea Rangers were produced
And there was more to come for Model 206
The Kiowa While Bells Jet Ranger flew thousands of
people across the US without incidents Hughes OH6A Cayuse struggled in Southeast Asia
The fighting in Vietnam had turned into a meat grinder
In January 1968 the North Vietnamese launched a mass offensive during the Tet New Year festivities
and dozens of cities were sieged by the Communist forces
Thanks to the effectiveness of the Ho Chi Minh Trail the North Vietnamese Army was
now supplied and equipped with modern Soviet and Chinese equipment including antiaircraft
countermeasures that were making quick work of the American OH6A Cayuses
The Cayuse was exposed to enemy fire during scouting and artillery fire correction missions
making it an easy target for hidden Viet Cong or NVA troops
Casualties for Hughes helicopter were piling up and the company could not keep up with
production and its costs
The Army reopened the LOH competition because Hughes could not meet production demands
Bell submitted its upgraded Model 206 Jet Ranger and won the contract
It was designated OH58A and named the Kiowa following the Armys tradition of honoring
Native American tribes
The OH59 Kiowa was delivered to Army inventories in May 1969
It had a length of 34 feet a width of 35 feet and a height of 129 feet
The scout helicopter had a weight of 3289 pounds
Compared to its civilian variant the Kiowa featured military instruments multiple radios
Army olive drab livery and deflecting blades above the canopy and belove the nose to avoid
crashes with electrical wires
The Kiowa was also powered by an Allison T63A700 engine rated at 315 horsepower mounted atop
and to the rear of the passenger cabin
The cockpit was wellforward and provided allaround visibility for the pilot and copilot
thanks to the large windscreens and the option to remove hinged side doors
Changing the Mission Behind the cockpit the passenger cabin featured
entryexit doors and enough room for three soldiers or two medical litters
The first Kiowa variant featured a flexible twinbladed main rotor that would later be
replaced with a fourbladed one with the OH58D model
The first batch of Kiowas arrived in Vietnam in August 1969 to support the Hughes Cayuse
in the reconnaissance observation and medical evacuation roles
The Kiowas were lightly armed with either an M129 40millimeter automatic grenade launcher
or a powerful 762millimeter M134 Minigun that could fire up to 4000 rounds per minute
During a North Vietnamese offensive in April 1972 John Paul Vann a US civilian advisor
who often piloted Kiowas directly coordinated the attack of AC130s jet fighters Cobras
and Hueys to destroy enemy formations trying to overrun Firebase Delta in the Highlands
In his book A Bright Shining Lie Author Neil Sheehan recalls that Vann unsatisfied
with providing guidance for US aircraft began stocking his Kiowa with as many supplies as
the helicopter could handle to deliver them to Firebase Delta
Six times the brave man and his Kiowa delivered ammunition and other supplies to the besieged
troops under enemy ground fire
Weeks later Vann and his Kiowa were landed in a ravine to extract US and South Vietnamese
advisors while enemy tanks approached
The helicopter escaped unscratched
But Vanns luck soon ran out
On June 9 1972 he and his entire crew were lost when his Kiowa crashed into a hill due
to low visibility and light rain
Over 310 Kiowas served in Vietnam between 1969 and 1973
More than 50 of them were combat losses
The Warrior Following the end of the Vietnam War the
US and NATO prepared for a possible largescale Soviet Invasion of Western Europe
The Soviets had AA defenses that were far more effective than the highly effective Strela
2man portable air defense system
This led to an improved variant of the Kiowa equipped with an ANAPR39A Radar Warning
Receiver to inform the crew about enemy radars and night vision goggles for night operations
A more powerful engine made the helicopter faster and more maneuverable
This was the Charlie variant or OH58C
Nevertheless this variant did not solve the armament issue the Kiowa faced since Vietnam
Meanwhile the Army was hard at work introducing the iconic UH60 Blackhawk and the AH64 Apache
In 1981 the Army Helicopter Program upgraded the Kiowa with sophisticated sensors a thermal
imager a laser designator and the iconic MMS or Mast Mounted Sight that made the Kiowa
easily recognizable
The Kiowa Warrior or the OH58D variant was fitted with a RollsRoyce T703AD700A
turboshaft engine providing 650 horsepower and a top speed of 149 miles per hour
It had a range of 345 miles and a service ceiling of over 15000 feet
The Warrior packed some punch and was armed with 127millimeter machine guns in either
M296 or M3P mounts Hellfireguided antitank missiles Hydra 70 highexplosive unguided
rockets and AIMS92 Stinger airtoair missiles
During the 1980s and 1990s over 400 Kiowas were upgraded to the Warrior variant becoming
crucial for their new armed light scout role during the conflicts of the Middle East in
the same decade
Iraq and Iran were engulfed in a power struggle that resulted in US involvement in providing
escort services to merchant ships in the Persian Gulf
The Kiowas were bound for the Persian Gulf
Reagans War on Drugs Kiowa Warriors replaced other helicopters
for Operation Prime Chance during the IranIraq War
The objective was to escort oil tankers
From February to September 1988 the Kiowas patrolled the Persian Gulf but were never
engaged by the Iranian Navy
During these operations the Kiowas cooperated with Task Force 118 Little Birds locating
and evading enemy vessels
One year later in 1989 they returned to the Middle East when Iraq invaded Kuwait
As Operation Desert Shield turned into Operation Desert Storm over 115 Kiowas were deployed
for different combat roles
Like in Vietnam the Kiowas spotted Iraqi objectives for Apache helicopters and other
attack aircraft to hunt them down
They also provided artillery fire correction to properly strike the enemy
No Kiowa Warrior was lost in combat during the war against Iraq during the Gulf War
During this time the Kiowas were also dispatched to the US following Reagans War on Drugs
The National Guard Bureau created Reconnaissance and Aerial Interdiction Detachments or RAIDs
of which over 80 were Kiowas that conducted more than 1200 counterdrug reconnaissance
and interdiction operations
At the dawn of the XXI century the Kiowas were again deployed to the Middle East as
part of the War on Terror
The OH58D became part of the air units participating in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring
Freedom in Afghanistan
According to Bell the Kiowas flew over 820000 combat hours by April 2013
Over 35 helicopters were lost in combat operations and accidents before American retirement from
Drawing Enemy Fire While in Afghanistan Chief Warrant Officer
Patrick Benson flew numerous reconnaissance and security missions on a Kiowa becoming
the eyes in the sky for American attack helicopters
In September 2009 Benson and his copilot were providing security and reconnaissance
for infantry attacking Taliban troops in a mountain in what is known today as the Shuriak
Benson left the area for a refuel and minutes later the Marines left behind were ambushed
During the fight two Marines were hurt and Benson was called again to provide Medevac
The Blackhawk helicopter dispatched to hoist up the wounded Marines was immediately attacked
by the enemy threatening the extraction
The men on the ground did what they could to fight off the enemy attack but they were
outnumbered and the Blackhawks safety turned precarious with every second that passed
It was then when Bensons Kiowa appeared out of nowhere and did the unbelievable for
a light reconnaissance helicopter of its class it began to draw enemy fire away from the
Soon the small helicopters nose was punctured by small arms fire wounding Benson and leaving
his copilot unconscious
Nevertheless Benson did not falter and continued to assist until the Blackhawk safely evacuated
the area
With his aircraft failing and his bestman Adam Stead wounded Benson landed at the nearest
base to save his copilot and his Kiowa
Due to his extreme bravery shown in combat Benson was awarded the American Legion Valor
Award proving that even a small helicopter such as the Kiowa can change the tide of
battle if used properly
The Army officially retired the Kiowa from service in July 2020 after it selected the
Bell 360 Invictus and Sikorskys Raider X as possible replacements for the Future Attack
Reconnaissance Aircraft program
Nevertheless the Kiowa remains in operation with several allied nations across the globe
proving that after more than 50 years of service it continues to excel as a reconnaissance

Hello friends!
About 60 or 70 years ago
when people were asked
to imagine how the year 2020 would look
people imagined futuristic looking cities
Cars flying in the sky
Flying cars would have become a reality
But unfortunately it didnt happen
The reality looks like this today
While people imagine the year 2020 to look like this
But do you know what friends?
Flying cars are something
thats slowly becoming a reality
Today in 2022
a company in Slovakia
has successfully tested an actual flying car
This isnt a dream for the future
it is the reality now
Come lets understand this technology in todays video
If you havent noticed lately
were living in the future
But theres still one thing thats conspicuously absent
Where are the flying cars?
I was promised flying cars
I dont see any flying cars
Would there ever be an aircraft
where you can just jump in
and be able to take off and fly where ever you want to?
Listening to it friends it feels like
a flying car is something really futuristic
but people had started trying to make one about 100 years ago
The year 1917
saw the first attempt at building a flying car
Or perhaps a roadable aeroplane
An aeroplane that can navigate roads too
It was named the Autoplane
This was built by Glenn Curtis
It was given the title Limousine of the Year
But was this flying car actually able to fly?
Its said that when they tried to fly it
it lifted off the ground
but unfortunately it couldnt fly properly
So the Autoplane turned out to be a failure
After this we get to 1933
when the US Air Commerce Bureau conducted a competition
called the Flivver Competition
They challenged people to design an aeroplane
that would cost less than 700 to build
Many models were submitted in this competition
and one of these models was of the Aerobile
Designed by Walda Waterman
This was an aeroplane that looked like a car
It could take flight
but never went into production
because they were going through the Great Depression
There were enough funds to produce it
But what could be called the first successful attempt
took place in 1945
American inventor Robert Edison Fulton
built an aeroplane called the Airphibian
It looked like a proper aeroplane
the only difference was that the front of it could be detached
It took about 5 minutes to convert this aeroplane into a car
And the resulting car looked like the front of the aeroplane
For its era this Airphibian was quite innovative
and it got a flight certification from the Civil Aviation Authority
But the problem was that
because of the compromises in the design
it was neither a good aeroplane
that could compete with the other aeroplanes
Nor was it a good car
that could compete with the other cars
When it turned into a car it looked really weird
To add to it in 1945 there were financial problems due to World War II
This company could not find investors for this flying car
And then came the Convaircar
Industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss attempted this in 1947
This looked like a car stuck with an aeroplane on it
Airphibian looked like an aeroplane completely
But this looked as if
the car got stuck to the aeroplane by mistake
and is now flying with it
It too took 5 minutes to convert from an aeroplane to a car
And by converting it meant
detaching the aeroplane part and keeping it aside
And then it could be used as a car
It was a great idea for its time
And in its third test flight
this Convaircar crashed
The pilot checked the reading on the meter
and thought that there was enough fuel and that he could continue flying
and though the car did have enough fuel
there was very little in the aeroplanes tank
It led to this unfortunate crash
After this crash people lost confidence in it
And the investors backed out
The problem with these attempts was that
they took a car and they took an aeroplane
and they tried to combine them as they were
A true flying car would be one
that could actually transform from an aeroplane to a car
The two cant simply be combined
merely to detach the part of the aeroplane when the car is used
Morton Taylor was the first person
to decide to work on the design of Airphibian
and to make the wings of the Airphibian foldable
So that when it has to be used as a car
the wings can be folded
and stored behind the car
This came true in the year 1949
It was named Taylors Aerocar
They got the certification
the approval for mass production
but the problem was that
they needed at least 500 advance orders
before mass production could begin
But there werent enough people interested in it
So they couldnt get the orders
So the deal had to be cancelled
At one point the company Ford was quite close
to buying this Taylor Aerocar
But that deal couldnt be finalised either
There was a scarcity of funds
but perhaps a bigger problem was
the lack of technological advancement
We didnt have the technology
to build a true flying car
But today
neither do we lack funds
and the technology has moved by leaps and bounds since the 1950s
So the recent attempts at building a flying car
have been amazing
They are truly futuristic
In October 2021
a Swedish company called Jetson Aero
presented their Jetson 1 Airplane to the world
As you can see
it doesnt look like a car at all
rather it can be called an extralarge drone
Because it flies just like a drone
A person sits inside it and pilots it around
It is a singleseater vehicle
Only one person can sit inside it
They had started working on it in 2017
The first prototype was ready in January 2018
and it had its first successful flight too
But they introduced their company
and presented their 2nd generation prototype to the world
Its speciality is its design
A helicopter needs a helipad to take off
but this is so compact
so small that it can land on your roof
and take off from your neighbourhood garden as well
To keep it lightweight
its frame is made of aluminium
And it weighs only 86kg
It is very light
And the person sitting in it
can weigh up to 95kg
Perhaps the most interesting thing is that
you wouldnt need a pilots license to fly it
Because according to the US Laws
there is no need for a pilots license
for a homebuilt singleseater aircraft
Since it is a singleseater aircraft
only one person can sit in it
and its homebuilt too
because if you buy it
itll reach you 50 assembled
You can order it from anywhere in the world
the way that the company ships this to you
you need to assemble it yourself
So it comes under the category homebuilt
With this the legal hassles for the company reduce
Because the company would no longer be responsible in case of accidents
Because you have put it together
Jetson 1 is truly very futuristic
but it cannot be practically used much
Because you cant fly it at night
You cant fly it over city traffic
Because these are restricted airspace
And generally
it is quite difficult to fly a camera drone nowadays
it will be very difficult to get permission to fly this
But their cofounder Peter Ternstrom has said that
they arent trying to solve a problem in the world
they are simply promoting it as a fun activity
He claims that it is fun to fly it
You can guess the origins of the name of the company Jetson
If you recall The Jetsons used to be a cartoon show a while ago
And the futuristic aircraft used by the Jetsons to travel
looked somewhat like this
So they tried to copy that design
and took inspiration from it
So this Jetson 1 cannot be termed as a proper flying car
Because it can run on the roads
But theres another company in Slovakia
They presented their Aircar to the world last month
It is a flying car in true essence
Friends it is very clear
that to build such technology
we need skilful engineers and out of the world innovation
Unfortunately innovative things of this level
can be rarely seen in countries like India
A huge reason for this is that
there are many engineers with degrees in India
but they lack the skills that are actually needed to do a job properly
More than 90 of the engineers in India
arent employable due to this
Thankfully there are some companies
that are helping software engineers to become more skilled
Like Scalercom
Scalercom is a tech school
where the subject matter experts from the top tech companies teach students
They share their industry experience with the learners
They focus on college students and working professionals
so that they can be upskilled
Especially with their oneonone mentorship programs
They focus on making them more skilful
They claim that in 20202021
more Scaled learners got placement in Amazon
compared to all the IITs combined
They provide the learners with every tool
with which they can become more skilled
and can further their careers
If you are interested
you can check out scalercom through the link given in the description below
Id recommend their Software Development Course
and the Data Science course
They would help you achieve the right fundamentals
and you would get basic problemsolving skills
Lets return to the topic
So whats special about the AirCar?
It completed its first intercity flight in June last year
From the international airport Nitra to the Bratislava airport
Both cities are in Slovakia
And Slovakia is an Eastern European country
Last month the Transport Authority of Slovakia
gave it clearance for takeoff
It received the Certificate of Airworthiness
The European Aviation Safety Agencys
all testing safety standards are obeyed by this flying car
This is the first flying car to actually look like a flying car
They used a BMW car as a base
and have attached wings to it
The attempts of 6070 years ago
was when they tried to stick a part of the aeroplane to a car
But this is the first attempt
where the wings come out of the car
No special fuel is needed to fly it
The petrol that you get at the petrol station
is enough to fly this car
Because a 16l BMW engine is fitted inside it
While flying this AirCar can reach a height of 8000 feet
And it can fly at the speed of 190 kmhr
And a maximum of 2 people can sit in the car
And to transform from an aeroplane to a car
it takes only 3 minutes
This is the way it transforms
The wings can be folded to the back
And everythings automatic
Theres no need to unscrew anything or to separate anything
It is all in one piece
You can see the wings going into the back of the car slowly
and it is transforming into a compact car
On the road this AirCar would look like this
It looks like a normal car on the road almost
But it is a little overboard at the back
It isnt bad
Because some cars are long at the back
One things certain
to fly this you would need a pilots license
because it needs a proper runway to take off
This AirCar has completed more than 200 takeoffs and landings
so theres no doubt that it is a successful flying car
If you want to buy it
how much would you need to pay?
Its said that its price will start from 500000 ranging to 1 million
depending upon the model you want to buy
And within 12 months
it will become commercially available
Meaning you can buy it in the market then
The founder of Jetson 1 had said that
they see their aircraft as a means to have fun
Its supposed to be used by people as a fun activity
But the company that has made the AirCar
Klein Vision
they believe that this AirCar
will replace helicopters in the future
Because the internal combustion engine of a normal car is used in it
it would mean that its very energy efficient
Normally to fly helicopters and aeroplanes
a lot of fuel is used
They need special fuel
But since this AirCar can fly with a cars engine
it would mean that in the future
it wouldnt be very difficult to use the engine of an electric car
to fly this AirCar
It means that
a fully electric AirCar can be possible
It will be good for the environment
in comparison to helicopters and normal airplanes
The most important question to arise here is
Whats the need for this?
Can there be a practical use for these flying cars?
The most important use for these flying cars is said to be
for emergency services
Such as for ambulances fire engines or for the police
One advantage would be that it would be easier to use than helicopters
And theres no need to build separate infrastructure for them
Railway tracks need to be laid for trains
tunnels have to be dug for metros
roads need to be built for cars
but for the flying cars the same infrastructure can be used
that already exist
Another major advantage of these is that
these are very flexible
Talking about Jetson 1 aircraft
they can land and take off from anywhere
We will get endtoend connectivity here
And obviously the environmental impact
can be reduced drastically
because normally cars take a long time to cover long distances
but flying cars would be able to do it faster
And theyll consume less energy as well
But if you talk about their disadvantages
perhaps they have more disadvantages than advantages
The first is that
Do we really need flying cars?
Lets compare it with the cars
Nowadays cars have become very common
in almost every city of every country in the world
Everyone needs to take a driving test to get a drivers license
But despite that
many people drive irresponsibly
there are accidents
so many people die in traffic accidents around the world
If people cant learn to drive properly on the road
will they be able to learn to fly properly?
Itll be 10 times more difficult
Itll have 10 times more scope of causing accidents
And if an accident does occur midair
it would be that much more deadly
This is a very serious issue
how many people would need to get sufficient pilot training
to fly these?
A solution to this problem can be
automated flying cars
That the flying cars fly automatically with interference from the pilot
Like the automated cars nowadays
Tesla already has these features
where the car can drive itself
If such selfdriving flying cars are made
only then can this problem be avoided
But talking about Tesla
Elon Musk believes flying cars to be a bad idea
Because according to him
when there will be thousands of cars flying in the sky
somewhere or other therell be an accident
and if one of those cars fell on someones head
that person will die instantly
The risk of people losing their lives in these accidents is very high
And normally when your car breaks down
you park it at the side of the road to check it
But if your car breaks down in the sky where would you park it?
These problems would increase in bad weather
Imagine that you are flying your car
and it is very windy
or theres a thunderstorm
suppose theres a lot of turbulence
Normally since the aeroplanes are much larger
they can bear it
But in smaller private jets
theres an increased threat from turbulence and bad weather
And since the flying cars wouldnt be very big
theyll face the same threats
After this theres also the problem of safety
Its true that no new infrastructure is needed for a couple of flying cars
but if thousands of cars fly in the sky
a new system of traffic lights will need to be put up
Such as the ones for cars
Since the cars will be flying in all directions theres a dire need for traffic lights
Newt technical standards would need to be enforced
so that the flying cars could communicate with each other
so that there arent collisions and crashes
But it wouldnt be easy to do this
Because today it is so difficult for governments to make regulations for drones
That the governments take to banning drones
And these drones merely fly to take aerial photos and videos
To do so for the flying cars
how difficult it would be from the governments perspective
you can already imagine it
Then comes the problem of noise pollution
If you have flown any small drone
you would have noticed the loud sound while flying it
Or if youve gone closer to a helicopter
it is on the next level
Thats why you need to put on headphones in the helicopter
These same problems exist for flying cars
These problems exist in Jetson 1 and AirCar too
It creates a lot of noise
It is so noisy that it isnt practical to use it in the urban environment now
To deal with this a new technological innovation is needed
So that the noise level of the flying cars can be reduced to a bearable extent
Apart from noise another area which needs some innovation is the
fast charging technology
Nowadays drones can be flown for up to 20 minutes only
How long would the flying cars last in the air?
With the present technology
it can fly up to 50 km only
after that they would need to be charged or refuelled
And it takes up a lot of time
These are the practical problems
that need to be solved in the future
for this technology to be successful
Even if all these problems are solved
the final problem to arise here
would be the cost
After so many innovations
the final price of the flying car
would be at a level where people would actually want to buy it?
Will it be practical for people to buy it?
Now the AirCar costs around 1 million
if the cost isnt affordable
it would be very difficult for it to be truly successful
This is valid for any new technology
If the competing technologies are offered at a much better cost
the competing technologies would be the ones to be successful in the future
If travelling by cars trains and aeroplanes is at a much lower price
in comparison to flying cars
then the flying cars would never be successful

What is its maximum speed?
If you want to check its maximum speed come
I will move the steering left the light focus has already turned
I feel like its eyes are moving
The reverse parking camera is hidden
Come and find out where is it
The ground clearance of the car
When we were coming the car touched the ground
What if someone tears the fabric of it?
We will talk about its advantages and its disadvantages too
Hi friends
After researching for two days
I have learned so many features of this car
We will tell you about these features now
Lets start the video
Yes Ok
So But first of all I want to tell you something

We opened the window that time
Then the wind comes very forcefully
So for that it also has an air cap
This car has an air cap Look at this friends
Its air cap is being opened
Can you see the air cap?
It has opened This is for safety
Yes The air pressure wont directly affect us
It will pass over us Yes
Its 4th feature is the seat
Oh this one Look from here this one
We dont need to push it

So that the legs get a bit of support Yes
It is called underthigh support
Pihu do it See your seat is also moving outward
Yes Press M and then press 1
Yes The beeping sound you heard has been stored in its memory
Now whenever Mom presses the 1 button for the seating position
The seat will adjust according to Mom
It will move outward
I havent learnt Kias function yet
When will I learn its functions?
Friends we will tell you its positive features which are almost 10
However we will also tell you its negative features
Ok He will tell you all the features Yes
Why did we buy this car?
We will tell you that too
The next feature is the music system
It has 15 speakers
15 speakers?
Where are those hidden?
They are hidden
Two here two there two and two We can see 8
Yes This cars seats also have speakers installed One is there

Some speakers must be installed below as well as above
It must be installed indoors towards the leg
Wait Im sitting inside
Aayu dont start the car sit carefully
Its not on if it would be on dont worry it is in the parking gear
Thats why Aayu has understood its on parking gear
Increase the volume
Role it
Its real audio
Lower it down
It is open now
Yes Even with the car open the sound is so good
This sound is enough to party
Right we can have a party around with music playing
Yes but the neighbors will come outside thats why no
Yes we cant do this Ok
Pause it
Now one more feature What?
When we sit inside it
After sitting in it
The seat belt will automatically come forward
It will remind you to fasten your seatbelt
And move into position automatically
When the car starts the seat belt automatically tightens securely
It hugs you
Dad Yes
Then we cant play the radio in this Why?
Because it has no antenna We have closed the rooftop
It means we cant play FM
The radio option is available
Yes but we cant play Where is the antenna?
Every car has an antenna
The antenna looks like a stick or it is fishshaped
Yes Where is its antenna?
Its antenna is printed on the glass What?
Here there are very fine lines in groups of three Yes
Yes These lines
It has been printed up to this point Sister see
Do antennas like this also exist?
Yes Printed?
There was no space left thats why they printed it on the glass
They have stuck a sticker on it Wow! what a technology
We cant recognize it Dad
Yes What is its maximum speed?
Open its menu then set
Then Vehicle
Its maximum speed is 160
But 260 is written here Is this a lie?
No we can increase it
You can set its maximum speed limit
They have given a maximum speed limit
If you set the speed limit to 160 the car will stay within that
No matter how much you accelerate
You can set it to 240
Yes We can set it to a maximum of 240
Ok I got it Wow!
Anyway we are not going to drive the car at such high speeds
Because there are no roads for that
Yes There should be roads like that for driving a car
We have set it to 120
120 is the maximum speed limit in India
That is allowed only on the expressway Yes
On other normal highways a speed of 80 or 100 is allowed
Or 60
Yes 60 is also allowed Even in the city speeds as low as 20 are common
I drive the car at a speed of 20 only
Now Ill tell you one more feature Ok
This is its trunk
If you want make trunk space
Or if you need to take something out of the trunk?
So this seat goes completely down
If two members are travelling we can set this up like this
If you have locked someone in the trunk
They can get out by pressing the button from inside
Thats it Dad?
Is that all the features it has?
These are the features that are not available in normal cars
Besides these there are other features in it as well
What? Show us
It has a separate AC
What do you mean?
Mom has a separate AC
This is my AC
Its a very good thing
Because I feel cold
And Dad feels hot
He always sets the AC temperature so low
That I feel cold
Not high low I mean low
Its showing 25 Mom will set it at 22
And Dad will set it at 18
17 16 Wow Dad!
OK friends let me tell you more features about this car
If the key fob battery has run out
You have to take out the start and stop buttons?
Insert the key fob and turn it
And the car will start
Friends this is its touchpad
With this I can easily browse through all the features
If I need to call someone I can dial here
And you can call
It has a safety feature friends
It has such a big door and there is a light
So that if a car comes from behind they can see that the door is open
This lights up too
This will focus the light on the ground as well
Friends I hope you can see it
As soon as I turn the steering wheel slightly
The light turns in that direction
You will see when I turn the steering wheel the light will turn along
Just like eyes Yes
See now I turned the steering straight the light turned straight
Yes See
The light dances here and there
It will be very beneficial on corners or turns especially in the dark
And on the highway also
Yes you will find it in driving right?
I just feel like its eyes are spinning
The best thing I like about this open roof is
We can open it at night and see the moon and stars
I love watching it
There is one more good feature Get down you have already seen it
Let me tell to friends get down as if Aayu has to go behind
So he will rotate this handle from here
And will leave the seat forward
This seat moves forward automatically
It also gets up and moves forward automatically
Go inside take your seat
Ok? And here we sat
As soon as you sit the seat will back to its original position
The headrest also came up as was set
It will take its original position automatically
The seat was a bit over relaxed now Pihu cannot fit properly
Look when Pihu touched the seat it moved forward back
Pihu was saying that Mom had moved the seat very far forward
The reason for adjusting the seat forward was so
That you could sit comfortably
Yes OK
The reverse parking camera is hidden in it
Come and find it
We cant see it
Come The camera is certainly installed at the back
It is in the back The reverse camera will be in the back only
Mom can say anything
The back camera is in the back only
Who knows a camera may fly in and come at the back
These should be its two eyes
No Yes these are its eyes
I know its inside the lights
Like its antenna No No I know
There is a camera installed inside the exhaust
Wow! The camera will burn inside the exhaust
Or maybe the camera is installed at the bottom? Here?
I know Here
No that is the reverse parking sensor
It shows me in the rear view mirror how close the car has come
So it is here
Let me show you you found it right?
Yes Okay Ill show you
This camera will appear when we put it in reverse gear
Its not somewhere down here isnt it?
You could see but you cant see
Show us?
It would come from here
Back off Dad will reverse it
Here is it
We saw it
Hello Hello
Can you see us?
But I did not understand Its cheating
Why have you kept it hidden?
Is it to avoid the evil eye?
This saves the camera from dust
Otherwise if we go somewhere in the dust
Dust sticks to the camera and we have to clean it again and again
Yes The highend cars
Like a windscreen washer from which water comes out
There is also a washer for such cameras a small one in those cars
But you did the cheating
What? When we came to see it you had not even opened it
You should have put it in reverse gear first Yes
Okay so now let us also tell its negative points
Yes tell us that too
Keep listening one by one
There are many
But? Yes
It is not like that you show us negative points
And say that we will send the car back
No it has come now We wont send it back
We will tell you in the end why we have bought the car okay?
Before the negative point we could not decide its name
We can ask friends to suggest the name for this car
Good! You will comment and tell us
The most common comments
Or whatever name we all like we will name it
Of course and we will tell who told its name
Okay tell us good names like what is the name of our KIA Miss Kerry
So the name of this car is MercedesBenz
The model is C300
Its style is called Cabriolet
Miss Cabri
Miss Cabri!
Miss Kerry and Miss Cabri
Friends you have to suggest to us
Yes you will tell us
Lets move on to the first negative point
Ground clearance
We have to pass through the breaker very slowly
Otherwise the car gets stuck at the bottom
And if all four of us are seated
Friends when we were coming the car had touched the ground
Yes the car got stuck in one place
Or when I am sitting alone then there is no problem
Im not that fat
You are the fattest among us
Of course one person weighs less than four
Reduce your waist a little
Yes second now?
Second you will tell
Let me tell you
Yes There is no trunk it has no space for keeping luggage
If the four of us are going somewhere
Cant go at all
This car is not suitable for the highway
But now we can drive this car on the highway
So the biggest problem is when to go on the highway
We can drive it at speed on the highway
To drive we will have to go to the highway
Yes If we go we will have to stay overnight
But where will we keep our luggage?
Lets do one thing Dad Aayu and I will sit in this Mercedes
Mom in KIA
Ok its done tell me more negative points
Two negative points are done Yes
Now whoever tells will get chocolate
The third negative point is its seat space
There is very little space inside the car
The front seats are super comfortable
But the rear seat is straight
Sister will sit after 2 years I will not be able to sit
There is no charger at the back either
Aayu Pihu were saying the same there is no charger
Now how will they charge the phone?
Yes It is in front isnt it?
Yes Look this type of car is considered a 2 seater
What? What?
And yes Dad one more negative point Come
This is fine leg space is still fine but
There is no seperate door to enter Where do we enter from?
First we must get out of the car then they can sit back
Otherwise they cant sit
Yes if the roof is open then jump and sit
Yes now give me the chocolate
Let me tell you there is no night lamp behind give me the chocolate
Let me tell you there is no safety give me the chocolate
How is there no safety? Tell us how is there no safety?
Well the roof is open Yes
The roof is open there is no safety
This car is not safe Yes
And the biggest point
We cannot drive the car with the roof open in the rain
We cant drive in storms extreme heat and sunlight
And even if we did
So pollution dust everything will come
And stink
We can smell everything if we drive with open roof
We cant open it and leave it
Yes And even if we close it and leave it
What if someone cuts this fabric and goes away?
No it is strong in this thing
The cloth on it the hooded cloth on top
It is made of bulletproof jacket cloth
Good So it wont even cut normally
One positive Ok
Well there are a lot of positive points
We are happy with you
Our last point is why we have bought this car
The convertible looks good and everyone likes it
And the hard work done by AayuPihu for 7 years
in making 500 videos
Because of this both of them have received this gift
Because they wanted a convertible car
Because we have to consider their wishes
They have done a lot of efforts since childhood
Thank you Dad and thank you Mom
Thank you to all of you too
Because of your support we were able to get this car
Tell us by commenting what should we name this car
Yes please name it
this is a jet powered car and that is Mr
Beast hows it going and if this car
cant jump over those school buses my
videos ruined and to make things even
more interesting we put this whole thing
together in about 30 days and we have no
idea if it works send the jet engine go
go Im James welcome to
Donut we have a LIF off so Mr Beast hit
us up and asked us to build him a jet
powered car this dude is the biggest
YouTuber in the world so obviously we
said yes and were all super stoked and
optimistic about this project theres no
way theres no way come 30 days to build
a rocket car why not explain okay so
technically we have a few problems to
actually pull this off were going to
need to find a car that we can attach
Jets to were going to need to find Jets
and then figure out how to put them on
the car and we need a way to control the
car without someone having to be inside
of it luckily were really good at
buying dumb Vehicles so first things
first we hopped on Gregs list to find
ourselves a
car and this is what we ended up with
its a 1997 Firebird a car that sort of
looks fast but its not something that
we really feel too bad about destroying
you ready to hear this baby
purr thats what a V6 supposed to sound
like take the thing for a spin theres
something loose on this front left I
dont know what it is I thought I could
hear a little squeaky noise coming from
the left rear listen the thing really
just has to live for about 2000 more
miles so now that we have our car all we
got to do is put Jets on
it um you just cant go to Jet
enginecom but were not even figur
were not even figuring that part out
turns out buying Jets isnt as easy as
youd think you need all kinds of
permits to buy the type of engines that
we need plus weve never worked with
jets before and havent no idea how to
even use them but we told Mr Beast wed
build him a jet powered car so we have
to find a solution and thats when
Jeremiah came up with a brilliant idea
go on YouTube and type in jet engine and
thats when he found a guy who just
might be crazy enough to help us out
Matt take it away yeah my name is Matt
from warp
perception turns out Matt has put jet
engines on a bunch of things not only
does Matt have access to the jet engines
We need he also volunteered to help us
put them on the car all right Matt so Mr
Beast wants us to jump a car over the
length of a football field is this
something you think were going to be
able to do ah yeah yeah thats
doable so we have our Jets but that
brings us to a new problem Matt lives
all the way in Chicago and were going
to need to bring the car to him now you
might not be surprised to learn that we
didnt exactly buy the best conditioned
Firebird so were going to need to do
some road trip prep I will see you in
Chicago very soon Matt see you here
youre welcome in Chicago yeah
baby step one install a sick vinyl wrap
were also going to need beefier
suspension to withstand the impact of
the ramp at high speed weve got a few
things to do to get this thing ready for
the big jump uh were going to be
replacing the stock wheels and tires
with a six set of esrs and we have some
fresh suspension just to freshen this
thing up a little bit so that we leave
the ramp nice and predictably after a
few days of work its finally time to
hit the
road Justin is making great time and
certainly nothing bad will happen in
Nebraska what happened whole pulley fell
off theres supposed to be a pulley
right here and now the belt is just
rubbing against this be
bearing we only have 15 days left before
jet car needs to be in North Carolina
and not broken so unfortunately we have
to get a trailer and tow the car the
rest of the way to Matt
Shop push it into the shop all right
guys Im here ready to get started
whats up Matt whats up Justin whats
up first order of business now that
were in Chicago check out that shiny
Bean second order of business fix that
pulley that made the car undrivable so
all I need to do replace the belt and
replace this pulley should be simple
15minute job never works out that way
and with the F bird fixed its finally
time to check out the Jets why not take
Matts jet powered scooter out for a
spin dude this thing is
terrifying dude this guys a warrior man
just should not be doing that now when
you think of a jet engine you probably
think of the big old Honkers on a
fighter jet were going with something
obviously a lot smaller now specifically
this is a single stage turbo jet engine
it actually has a lot of similarities
with a turbo that youd find in a car
engine now there are a couple components
to focus on now this compressor wheel is
what pulls in air into the combuster now
this would be the equivalent of a
combustion chamber in your car now air
gets pulled through and compressed in
the combuster fuel gets squirted in
through these nozzles right here now you
have compressed air you have fuel you
get spark in there when that spark
happens you get exhaust coming out which
spins the turbine wheel and this turbine
wheel is on the same shaft as the
compressor so you get more air being
pulled through so you can see how
similar that is to how turbo works now
the excess exhaust gas gets shot out
this nozzle right here and you get
forward thrust well be attaching seven
of these Jets to our Firebird for a
total of 500 50 lb of thrust now thats
not much compared to a commercial plane
like a 747 which makes over 100 times
that but when we combine this with the
acceleration from our V6 it should give
us enough beans to clear the football
field also unlike a regular car the Jets
will keep our Firebird accelerating even
after it leaves the ramp pretty cool so
now we just need to slap seven of these
bad boys on the back of our Firebird
should be easy right all right so we are
waiting on some parts to get here supply
chain issues have delayed some of the
crucial parts to mount the jet engines
so instead we got to move on to the RC
system our solution to this problem is
to attach big servos to the steering
wheel and the throttle so that Nolan can
drive it like a regular remote control
car were pretty much building a full
scale RC
car going to do this sort of uh quick
coupling adapter the steering wheel
Amazon does not have the hub adapter for
the steering wheel for this car for some
reason so it looks like were just going
to have to make it and I love making
parts from leftover scraps now that our
hub adapter is made everythings looking
good and moving swimly our plan actually
worked so yes good thing happen this
remote control system here actuates the
brake pedal as well as a theres a
steering servo so now theres no you
know human controls so the wiring is
good the system has power oh my God its
turning what thats so sick
sure what that is sick at the P look at
the PD oh its
moving look Ill be honest I am a little
nervous cuz I want us to be able to jump
this thing but Im also really excited
to do this like this is amazing this is
cool after a few days of working on the
RC system the missing jet Parks finally
arrived so now that were this far the
only real thing thats causing us issues
is we dont have a lot of time to test
it we are in a rush so uh hopefully we
can get as much development time in this
very short amount of time we have
left all right its been a long day we
have the fuel lines hooked up all we got
to do is put some fuel in the tank and
we get to fire it up and here it for the
first time you nervous yeah to test this
we have to start all seven engines at
the same time to check the amp draw we
are in the neighborhood its 1 pm but
got to do what we got to
do the Jets are finally running or so we
thought so we got one 1 two three yeah
started three didnt so were going to
do something with that battery and try
again right only two of the engines had
actually fired up at Full Throttle
meaning we have a serious wiring issue
to figure out and the jump is like in 3
days so we have no choice but to deal
with those issues when we get
there this is WD40 brand and guess what
theyre the sponsor of todays awesome
video Lets Go the WD40 brand is more
than just a classic name theyre game
changers born out of literal rocket
science you can Google it and theyve
got more than just the original WD40
formula with their Innovative specialist
line were talking dozens of specialized
heavyduty Solutions with tailored
Delivery Systems for the garage the
Factory The Farm wherever the tough job
is with Delivery Systems like easy reach
smart straw and big blast the original
WD40 formula and specialist line help
Next Level Pros get the job done right
weve been using WD40 products at donut
since the very beginning and to be
honest everyone around the worlds been
using them since 1953 for a reason if it
works great in outer space it works even
better here on Earth so whatever kind of
Next Level Pro you are find your next
level solution at WD40
docomo so now while the boys made their
way to North Carolina I hopped on a jet
powered vehicle of my own a
we just found out that Nolan and Phil
and Justin are about 2 hours uh late
theyre 2 hours later than they said
they would be
here so its not a really great look for
donut there they are jet car has landed
with all of us finally together we got
our first look at Mr Beast
jump a full4 mile drag STP leading to a
massive ramp over an entire football
field with 12 school buses on it I love
the optimistically tall Landing ramp as
well Landing ramp is taller than this
ramp and Meanwhile were sitting here
thinking should we tell him our car
doesnt work
yet we still have to address all the
problems with the car plus we havent
done any testing to make sure Nolan can
actually drive the thing without
crashing and to make things even worse
we were informed that the algorithm
doesnt like green Flames so we had to
take them off okay were at the track
the jump is tomorrow but we still dont
know whats up with those five engines
that didnt fully spin up so uh we got
to test that and then we opened up the
trunk and found another problem we got a
giant pool of kerosene sitting in the
bottom of the trunk the kerosene fuel
from the Jets spilled everywhere during
the road trip and all of the electronics
got soaked oh that was sick did it all
out cap this dude thats a lot of oh my
God we spilled a bunch of kerosene on
our engine control units so uh Matt and
I have taken them out of the car Matts
going to clean them uh and then well
put them back together hopefully no
kerosene has gotten into weird
electrical connections and messed it up
Im so tired and this is very stressful
if the electronics dont work neither
will our Jets so we have no choice but
to sit here and wait for them to dry
out a few hours later everything seems
dry enough I think they the purple
temperature so Matt and Nolan wired up
the first jet but Im actually nervous
here because we wont be able to get
another one if one of these uh gets
damaged so no sleep now its time to see
if it actually
works okay so thats one that we know
Works uh so now we just kind of have to
connect the stuff back together how we
already did and hopefully all seven fire
back up were going to test all seven
engines at the same time make sure they
can all hit Full Throttle at the same
time Perfect all right so were in the
car now uh were going to see how much
the Jets can move the car on their own
were going to put in neutral and see
what happens
chcken down dude Im not Im not Im not
Mak that bro lets cut
it no no no thats not what I me that
was no engine that was just all jet all
Jet and neutral nice okay so that was
only slightly terrifying uh but we have
run out of daylight and we still havent
tested the RC system yet so we have a
very little time in the morning and then
we have to do the
jump were back Ive got a full nights
sleep and I feel great okay we got 2
hours until Mr Beast gets here 2 hours
sounds like a lot of time but its
really not when we got here the jet
engines were pouring gas all over the
track luckily we addressed that still
the brakes dont work Ive never driven
it with the RC system but I guess the
good news is that Jimmy gets here in 2
so we have 20 minutes left we are
finally testing the RC system uh were
still having some trouble with the
brakes right down to the wire as we
always are okay here we go
so it works perfect all right were
going to go to the uh midpoint location
where Im going to be sitting for the
Run car uh works now we just got to test
it with driving with the fpv system get
some practice in oh yeah not only will
Nolan be controlling an actual car with
a remote controller but hes also going
to be wearing fpv goggles from a drone
and we have done absolutely no testing
with any of this stuff either we better
not crash it now cuz we only got one jet
god oh oh I just lost feed dude breaks
not working oh yeah it is dude that was
a minute of of helmet time before it cut
out like the feed cut out uh a little
stressed right now yeah uh near the end
of the track like the feet on the
goggles cut out so I just lost control
man dude that was a little
nervewracking I got to got to be
honest big time big time but before we
can figure out a solution to the goggles
we just got worded that the Beast has
landed Jesus
Christ oh my God oh my God are you going
to start all the way down there
thankfully Mr Beast and his friends are
all impressed Im bringing my 2yearold
out here this is like I feel like going
to make me the coolest dad ever so I
turn this into the hypothetical wheel
turn oh my God
oh thats so cool where it is very cool
but I dont I dont know Im just used
to things breaking whenever sometimes I
touch stuff like this and then it just
stops working and it delays set by its
not going to stop working okay here just
I here make sure it still works all
right Ill see you in a minute car got
speed car where is it going all you Im
done and now its time for the jump but
heres the thing were not going to jump
jet car just yet were actually going to
jump not a jet car not a jet car a its
just a its just a regular its a
regular now in order to demonstrate how
good jet car is Mr Beast also bought a
second Firebird that we also need to
jump off a ramp and the entire time that
weve been working on jet car Justin has
been working all day mouning the remote
control system to not a jet car but
there are two problems number one the
fpv issue if Nolan falls out of range he
can crash the car so I came up with the
idea to drive down the drag strip in a
side by side to stay close close enough
to the signal problem solved but theres
also a more complicated problem I can
hear the bottle moving there you go not
a jet car might look the same as jet car
but its a different model gear and our
remote controlled gas pedal wont work
with the newer throttle body and we have
no time to fabricate a new system so
well need another way to accelerate the
car we didnt get this car working the
way we wanted but were going to do it
the caveman way throw a brick on the
pedal and send it to the Moon
bricks all right were just waiting for
the goahead from the team to send the
stock car down over the ramp I still
have no camera no camera no camera okay
is it good good to go is uh Justin clear
does Justin have a walk no no
no oh go
okay its
he destroyed that wow oh my
God we got to get over there wheres the
golf cart D dude that was the sickest
thing ever Against All Odds not a jet
car was a success Nolan laced it holy
crap boys this is insane it went through
a bus it went right through the
exit but its not time to celebrate yet
it so sick oh man oh my ridiculous oh my
God I cant wait any longer J in lets
do we still have a jet car to jump and
if it doesnt do better than not a jet
car the whole project will be a failure
and well be so embarrassed and with the
sun going down on North Carolina the car
was as ready as it can be its time to
line it up on the drag strip and get
into position okay I still I do not have
camera feed we still dont have camera
feed you have no camera feed we still
dont have any feed from the fpvs we
lost the feed into the fpv you are
currently trying to figure it out
because that is the scariest thing that
happen okay I got it I got it we have
visual lets go is uh throttle I hear
them I hear them theyre throttle all
right jet car time baby the car is in
park why they put it in park God damn
it God damn it send the jet engine put
the car in
drve back on Full Throttle wait for
go wait for
confir H here we
go here we go here we go
James Here Comes oh its going way
faster its going so much
oh oh it pushed the bus over it just the
bus over the bus fli its on
fire Im feeling so relieved
man hope it look cool did we jump an
entire football field no was jet car a
succcess yes theres no way theres no
way why 30 days to build a rocket car
sick oh man oh gosh look at this wa I
dont know what I was expecting it to
look like it wasnt that W the hood got
peeled back oh thats what that is wow
what if you had to play football in
this boys I just want to say thank you
so much boys you guys killed it that was
so epic thank
