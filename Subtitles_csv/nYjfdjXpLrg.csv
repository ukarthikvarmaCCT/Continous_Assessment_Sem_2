No we can increase it
You can set its maximum speed limit
They have given a maximum speed limit
If you set the speed limit to 160 the car will stay within that
No matter how much you accelerate
You can set it to 240
Yes We can set it to a maximum of 240
Ok I got it Wow!
Anyway we are not going to drive the car at such high speeds
Because there are no roads for that
Yes There should be roads like that for driving a car

Insert the key fob and turn it
And the car will start
Friends this is its touchpad
With this I can easily browse through all the features
If I need to call someone I can dial here
And you can call
It has a safety feature friends
It has such a big door and there is a light
So that if a car comes from behind they can see that the door is open
This lights up too
This will focus the light on the ground as well
Friends I hope you can see it
As soon as I turn the steering wheel slightly
The light turns in that direction
You will see when I turn the steering wheel the light will turn along
Just like eyes Yes
See now I turned the steering straight the light turned straight
Yes See
The light dances here and there
It will be very beneficial on corners or turns especially in the dark
And on the highway also
Yes you will find it in driving right?
I just feel like its eyes are spinning
The best thing I like about this open roof is
We can open it at night and see the moon and stars
I love watching it
There is one more good feature Get down you have already seen it
Let me tell to friends get down as if Aayu has to go behind
So he will rotate this handle from here
And will leave the seat forward
This seat moves forward automatically
It also gets up and moves forward automatically
Go inside take your seat
Ok? And here we sat
As soon as you sit the seat will back to its original position
The headrest also came up as was set
It will take its original position automatically
The seat was a bit over relaxed now Pihu cannot fit properly
Look when Pihu touched the seat it moved forward back
Pihu was saying that Mom had moved the seat very far forward
The reason for adjusting the seat forward was so
That you could sit comfortably
Yes OK
The reverse parking camera is hidden in it
Come and find it
We cant see it
Come The camera is certainly installed at the back
It is in the back The reverse camera will be in the back only
Mom can say anything
The back camera is in the back only
Who knows a camera may fly in and come at the back
These should be its two eyes
No Yes these are its eyes
I know its inside the lights
Like its antenna No No I know
There is a camera installed inside the exhaust
Wow! The camera will burn inside the exhaust
Or maybe the camera is installed at the bottom? Here?
I know Here
No that is the reverse parking sensor
It shows me in the rear view mirror how close the car has come
So it is here
Let me show you you found it right?
Yes Okay Ill show you
This camera will appear when we put it in reverse gear
Its not somewhere down here isnt it?
You could see but you cant see
Show us?
It would come from here
Back off Dad will reverse it
Here is it
We saw it
Hello Hello
Can you see us?
But I did not understand Its cheating
Why have you kept it hidden?
Is it to avoid the evil eye?
This is cool
This saves the camera from dust
Otherwise if we go somewhere in the dust
Dust sticks to the camera and we have to clean it again and again
Yes The highend cars
Like a windscreen washer from which water comes out
There is also a washer for such cameras a small one in those cars
But you did the cheating
What? When we came to see it you had not even opened it
You should have put it in reverse gear first Yes
Okay so now let us also tell its negative points
Yes tell us that too
Keep listening one by one
There are many
But? Yes
It is not like that you show us negative points
And say that we will send the car back
No it has come now We wont send it back
We will tell you in the end why we have bought the car okay?
Before the negative point we could not decide its name
We can ask friends to suggest the name for this car
Good! You will comment and tell us
The most common comments
Or whatever name we all like we will name it
Of course and we will tell who told its name
Okay tell us good names like what is the name of our KIA Miss Kerry
So the name of this car is MercedesBenz
The model is C300
Its style is called Cabriolet
Miss Cabri
Miss Cabri!
Miss Kerry and Miss Cabri
Friends you have to suggest to us
Yes you will tell us
Lets move on to the first negative point
Ground clearance
We have to pass through the breaker very slowly
Otherwise the car gets stuck at the bottom
And if all four of us are seated
Friends when we were coming the car had touched the ground
Yes the car got stuck in one place
Or when I am sitting alone then there is no problem
Im not that fat
You are the fattest among us
Of course one person weighs less than four
Reduce your waist a little
Yes second now?
Second you will tell
Let me tell you
Yes There is no trunk it has no space for keeping luggage
If the four of us are going somewhere
Cant go at all
This car is not suitable for the highway
But now we can drive this car on the highway
So the biggest problem is when to go on the highway
We can drive it at speed on the highway
To drive we will have to go to the highway
Yes If we go we will have to stay overnight
But where will we keep our luggage?
Lets do one thing Dad Aayu and I will sit in this Mercedes
Mom in KIA
Ok its done tell me more negative points
Two negative points are done Yes
Now whoever tells will get chocolate
What is this?
The third negative point is its seat space
There is very little space inside the car
The front seats are super comfortable
But the rear seat is straight
Sister will sit after 2 years I will not be able to sit
There is no charger at the back either
Aayu Pihu were saying the same there is no charger
Now how will they charge the phone?
Yes It is in front isnt it?
Yes Look this type of car is considered a 2 seater
What? What?
And yes Dad one more negative point Come
This is fine leg space is still fine but
There is no seperate door to enter Where do we enter from?
First we must get out of the car then they can sit back
Otherwise they cant sit
Yes if the roof is open then jump and sit
Yes now give me the chocolate
Let me tell you there is no night lamp behind give me the chocolate
Let me tell you there is no safety give me the chocolate
How is there no safety? Tell us how is there no safety?
Well the roof is open Yes
The roof is open there is no safety
This car is not safe Yes
And the biggest point
We cannot drive the car with the roof open in the rain
We cant drive in storms extreme heat and sunlight
And even if we did
So pollution dust everything will come
And stink
We can smell everything if we drive with open roof
We cant open it and leave it
Yes And even if we close it and leave it
What if someone cuts this fabric and goes away?
No it is strong in this thing
The cloth on it the hooded cloth on top
It is made of bulletproof jacket cloth
Good So it wont even cut normally
One positive Ok
Well there are a lot of positive points
We are happy with you
Our last point is why we have bought this car
The convertible looks good and everyone likes it
And the hard work done by AayuPihu for 7 years
in making 500 videos
Because of this both of them have received this gift
Because they wanted a convertible car
Because we have to consider their wishes
They have done a lot of efforts since childhood
Thank you Dad and thank you Mom
Thank you to all of you too
Because of your support we were able to get this car
Tell us by commenting what should we name this car
Yes please name it
