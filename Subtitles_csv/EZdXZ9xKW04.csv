Is this Bhabhis conspiracy?
Does Bhabhi wants him to leave the channel?
Was Bhabhi always plotting?
Was this Bhabhis plan?
Was this her conscious plan?
Yesterday Gaurav Taneja aka Flying Beast was arrested by the Noida Police
He was arrested on the basis of these two sections visible on your screen
Will discuss whether this arrest was right or wrong
What this tells us
well talk about it and decode whether the arrest was fine or not
But before that lets understand a few things What is Vlogging?
Show our life by holding camera?
Why does one do vlogging?
If something interesting is happening in your life
then you give a chance to the people in your life to peek
You must have seen that we are more interested in the life of others than our own
When we give this glimpse to others
then it is a source of entertainment for them
and for those bloggers there is a chance to get fame and create an influence
a chance to create an influence
Nowadays it also becomes a huge career option
Many times we also create such influence which benefits socially also do great things
I will also talk about those great things
must watch this video till the end
Before this video I asked all of you in a community post that
what do you get to learn from vloggers?
Got interesting reactions
I would highly recommend commenting through this post and read the comments
If you have any interesting observation then you must also comment
I would love to react to this on my Instagram
Earn money by telling the personal matter outside
How to show off your big house?
Tell me I am poor
Teach to speak Guys loudly
How to auction the privacy of the house in public?
To go to jail
Flying the dog by tying it to a balloon
They teach that the car can be rented
Is it wrong to earn money by vlogging like this from YouTube?
I dont think this is wrong
So many people who are in various positions
they earn so much money through corruption through cheating
earn a lot of money through manipulation
then a person by working hard
Means that when you are a small vlogger you dont have a team
you edit yourself and big vloggers also edit themselves
So I dont think there is any mistake if you are entertaining someone by working so hard
The mistake is when you set the wrong example in your vlog due to wrong influence
encouraging people to do wrong actions
It is wrong to show fake lifestyle in the name of content
Making people feel zealousy and being absolutely fake and overly sweet
showing so many good things that I think its not possible
Sometimes people go fake I think he is wrong
And making mistakes one after the other and not learning anything from that mistake
not acknowledging and admitting mistake
and not telling audience that Ive made a mistake and making many mistakes in a row
Whats not wrong?
It is not wrong when your mistake has happened for the first time
or the situation becomes such that that thing looks wrong
It is not wrong when you do a lot of such things which are not discussed in the media
but when you make a mistake or someone misguides you
and there are thousands of discussions about that thing
When you are socially aware channel your influence towards social initiatives too
that is not wrong
Teach people something with your content
Something similar happened with Flying Beast
Such an incident has happened to him
which must have happened for the first time in his vlogging career
So Ritu Bhabhi thought that I will make Flying Beasts birthday in the metro
She gave invitation to all 7 million people to come to Sector 51 Noida
Tomorrow is Gauravs birthday
And I have planned such a wonderful surprise
I have booked the entire metro for him
Will make his birthday there with all of you
This is a surprise and dont put any story by tagging him
You all come and well have a lot of fun
Tomorrow130 pm Sector 51 Noida
Im sure all these 7 million people are not only from Noida
but also from Delhi Gurgaon Ghaziabad Faridabad and may be from some other state also
How will these people let such an opportunity pass that too on Saturday?
A crowd gathered there
There the traffic stopped
whether it was an ambulance whether someone had an emergency going to office or school
whether someone was going for any emergency they all stopped there
were restrained which was not intentional unintentional
but they were restrained and thats why this section is applicable
You must be aware about the Covid situation for which this section is applicable
but it has also been violeted
Whether it happened intentionally or unintentionally
here Flying Beast is wrong Ritu Rathi is wrong or not lets discuss
Lets talk first why would she have done this?
The first reason that might have come to your mind as well
Is this Bhabhis conspiracy? No!
Does Bhabhi wants him to leave the channel? No!
Was Bhabhi always plotting? No!
Was this Bhabhis plan? No!
Was this her conscious plan?
No if it was Ekta Kapoors serial then it would have happened
but obviously theres nothing like that
I think Ritu Bhabhi did this because she genuinely wanted to give back something
or may be wanted to make his 36th birthday memorable
so she did that out of pure genuinity and innocent emotion
But what I expect from Ritu
is being more mature because obviously shes captain shes educated
she knows about law
I hope she know So this is tricky!
And Ill judge this thing on 5 grounds in a little while
But before that lets talk about what other reasons can be that Ritu Bhabhi did this
First obviously she wanted to make his birthday special
I think she was misguided!
Obviously Ritu bhabhi would have reached out
to people agencies management agencies that how we can do this
May be that idea was a misguidance!
She must have been misguided that this can be managed
There should be something different
You know Gaurav and Ritu never did any kind of controversies
There are many vloggers who get views by doing controversy
I react to controversy because it is my content
because I want to give perspective what is right what is wrong
who is manipulating you and who is not
But this is not the content of Ritu and Gaurav
There are many people whose content is not like this yet those people do
But Gaurav never did that
He has make this vlogging channel purely on the basis of merit
I dont think it was a publicity stunt
The psychology of vloggers is to do something different
and to make it different it happened!
And whoever has this misguidance we should pay attention to it
I will talk about that too but the third reason that why she would have done this
I dont think it was a publicity stunt
Psychology of vloggers is to do something different and make it big it may be
As a vlogger psychology challenges you
stuck on this particular number of what to do something different
stuck on this subscriber base and now how to go ahead
how to do something big and something new
How should we return the love back to the audience
I think all this problem has happened because of it
Now lets talk whether he should have been arrested or not
I would like to discuss this thing on five grounds
First  Awareness
Did they know about these sections?
Section 144 Covid situation
I believe so
Gaurav is IIT graduated and both are captains
Now Gaurav is also studying Law so I should believe
There was awareness
Now coming to the context
Get carried away by emotions She got carried away in emotions
Im making tea after that Im going to get ready
See you at 130 Bye!
Third  Intent!
Was it her intention that people should suffer?
Was it their intention that we dont care about law and order as some people are saying
I dont think so
But yes there intent was to do something big
Im 100 sure about it Atleast from whatever perspective
But to do something big that was their intent
Fourth  Pattern
Is it their pattern to do all this? No!
As we discussed there was no pattern
But there is one thing even though Gaurav and Ritu did not have a pattern
but all our political parties do
Whatever the situation was they did it
Theyve done it in much bigger numbers
But if someone else does all this and they are not punished
then does it make you right? I dont think so
If someone else is making a mistake do you get a license to make a mistake?
I dont think so!
I dont think so
So even on this basis I wouldnt give them any point
Even if their pattern is not there but there is a mistake
Last but not he least is Responsibilty
Was this a responsible act? No!
This was not a responsible act at all  Because if we talk about health
talk about covid talk about safety talk about law and order
then it was absolutely wrong and irresponsible act
Because with great powers comes great responsibility
If this is the first mistake then it can be forgiven
But this mistake has to be acknowledged has to be discussed
so that other mistakes dont happen
Because as part of my content I always talk about
where creator gone wrong in our Where creator gone wrong series
So thisb  time this creator has gone wrong specially Bhabhi
Specially when you talk about 241 Wrongful Restraint!
How many ambulances would be there how many people would be in emergency
when those people are upset then there is a mistake
I think there were many such risks in this case which should have been forsee
Anyone who is misguiding
Shouldnt have been agreed to him so soon
But whether Ritu Bhabhi and Flying Beast should have been arrested or not
then they were arrested it was right but they got bail that was also right
But my question is how many more people who should have been arrested in this
This is the whole process of approval when Bhabhi booked a metro coach
under whom does the metro come?
The approval which is given is given on whose basis whose approval is involved
what is its escalation process when approval is given
then who interprets its repurcations
Should the police be notified or not and by whom?
Should the agency be arrested?
Should any government official be fined on the one who gave the approval?
Is this the result of inefficiency?
Is this the result of negligence?
Is this matter only the result of the negligence of Ritu and Gaurav or of many other administrations?
Is our administration useless?
These are many questions that need to be asked
And it also has to be asked that what happens when these political rallies happen?
But at the same point of time I dont want to give creators excuse
If it happens we can do it too No you cant
If a person is doing wrong things then you cannot
If someone else is selling tobacco
then its fine their principles are different
But it doesnt give you the liense to do the same mistake
And what is happening it is not necessary that it is right
And accepting what has been happening because it is happening like this is also wrong
So thats why we shouldnt accept and just take this as an excuse
The reason is simple guys
There is collective irresponsibilty
There should be a collective penalty
on all those departments which are involved in this everyone should be punished
Media shouldnt just focus on one person
it should focus on entire process and the chain of events  linked to that
That would be my submission guys!
