Jimmy The Bermuda Triangle
is one of the most dangerous places on earth
Over 100 ships and planes have gone missing
with no explanation
Me and the boys are going to spend
24 hours straight in the Bermuda Triangle
Wish us luck
upbeat intense music
Guys were in the ocean
I want you all to make a will
I want you all to take a camera
and let us know if something were to happen to you
what would you want to happen with your money?
Its not a will if I dont have a feather and bloom
All right Im going to write my will in blues
My last will and testament
I dont own a lot of things
so Ill probably just leave my dog to my fam
and everything else to my family
But my ostrich is a free man
All right so my last will and testament
Im going to leave the house our cars our dogs our cats
To me
And all of our money to my wife
All right guys if I die

and my Xbox keep that
For their wills they wanted quills and paper

We came to a little bit calmer waters

sad music
How do you liking the Bermuda Triangle so far?
Its pretty dangerous to cameras
The only thing thats gotten hurt so far
in the Bermuda Triangle is literally our 7000 camera
I stubbed my toe
Honestly Im kind of enjoying it
Maybe its cause were on a yacht
but it doesnt seem that bad
The reason why all those sailors
and Amelia Earhart all went missing
cause its so nice here
Why would you leave?
Maybe the reason why this place is so dangerous
is because they dont have trees
Teamtreesorg or donate below the video
Were almost at 20 million
Now that all of you guys are fed
its time for the next challenge
As you know things in the Bermuda Triangle
typically go missing
So lets play hide and seek
You should count the 10000
cause youve already done it
Jimmy Im going to go count to 500
You guys hide whoever I find last gets 2000
Ooh Okay
So Im in my room and Im going to begin counting

Theres no way Im fitting
Tareq No dude You can you can

upbeat music
Theyll never notice me right here

Someone has to be here
I hear movement
I hope no ones hiding in the water
Well keep exploring

Chris I couldnt find anywhere else
All of my spots didnt work
I want another try
Lets check the rooms
This doors cracked and I bet you they left it cracked
So I wouldnt think someones in here
Making sure Im checking every nook and cranny
The look on your face was priceless
I thought I had someone
Chris You said I could not mess with other people
You didnt say I could not sword you
Oh you got to be quicker
I think theres someone in here
We know someones in the closet
How we mess with them?
We need Febreze and just start spraying Febreze
I know where some is
Were going to Febreze bomb whoevers in the bathroom
Chris Did you check in here?

Chris Hey buddy
You guys are sharing this room
Oh yeah arent you glad you found us?
Im very glad yes
Cause I was upstairs and I saw someone
but I think it was a crew member
and I was in my underwear
Jimmy While the seasickness
the camera falling in the ocean
and Chandler winning three challenges in a row
were all bizarre occurrences
we still werent convinced it was the Bermuda Triangle
But later that night we managed to get some footage
of some disturbing stuff
Hey Chandler
Chandler did you hear that?
I think I heard something
Thats okay
Got my trusty sword
Im going to sleep here with my sword
Tareq Conner can you see?

Tareq Thats your bedroom?
Yep All right well good night
upbeat music
All right Jake indistinct its currently 700 AM
Chris did we survive the Bermuda Triangle?
Chris I barely survived last night
Its cause you stayed up all night playing video games
Blade why dont you have pants on?
I was woken in my awoken sleep
Wrapping a towel around your waist is easier than pants?
Chris Its a blanket not a towel
I was told I was needed
Just going to go over here
upbeat music
Were heading back Its a little wavy
Im going to throw up
I feel like Im going to throw up
You want me to throw up on camera?
Tareq Not again
We made it
Never going on a yacht again not that I can afford it
I got sick a lot
I almost threw up
It turns out the only thing dangerous
about the Bermuda Triangle is motion sickness
and terrible tripods
Man Singing Mr Beast 6000 Oh oh
Mr Beast 6000 yeah you know his name
He changed it once or twice but I think its here to stay
explosion exploding
