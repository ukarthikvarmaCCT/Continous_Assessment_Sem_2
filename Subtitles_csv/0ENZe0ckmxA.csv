Mark Rober Today I helped MrBeast
conquer his fear of heights
It all started when I gave him
a tour of my secret lair CrunchLabs
and after I showed him what I call the firemans piston
he started to reveal his true colors
MrBeast Oh no
Bro Im terrified
How high is this?
Mark Rober Turns out the dude
who spent 50 hours buried alive
was wimping out over an eight foot drop
Im scared
Mark Rober But if he just had more trust
in the laws of physics
he wouldnt need to worry
cause when you step off
you pull down on the rope
and it pulls up on this plate
but all the air in the chamber here
has to get squeezed out of this tiny hole at the top
and that creates a traffic jam
And just like traffic jams in real life slow down your car
this one will slow you down to a nice easy landing
You just reminded me that Im deathly scared of heights
Mark Rober At this point I could have
put him at ease by telling him just how many five year olds
had already made the jump
but then again watching him suffer was way more fun
Mark Rober laughs MrBeast sighs
Bro I hate this
triumphant music crowd cheers and applauds
Im never doing that again
There you go You got your freaking video
