Hello friends!
In 1989 Bollywood stars Vinod Khanna Amjad Khan and Dimple Kapadia
were shooting for a film
This film was named Lekin
A dramamystery Bollywood film on ghosts
The story was about the spirit of a woman
being trapped in a palace looking for salvation
This film was being shot in a palace in Jaipur
One day on an otherwise normal day of shooting
after the shots were over people packed up
the sun had set night had fallen
and Dimple Kapadia was snug in her bed
She says that she saw a woman sitting beside her on the bed
She talked to the woman
and she had this eerie feeling that the woman was a ghost
This is just one example
But you will find hundreds of thousands of examples all over the world
where people claim to have seen ghosts and spirits
and even talked to them
Many people report that they went through paranormal experiences
So many films have been made on this
The Conjuring The Exorcist
The Exorcism of Emily Rose
These films claim to have been inspired from real events
There have been so many TV shows
Ghosthunters where people equipped with sophisticated instruments
go on a hunt to catch ghosts
They use technology to prove that ghosts exist
And some people make YouTube videos of talking to the spirits of dead people
Such as American paranormal expert Steve Huff
he claims to have talked to the spirit of the Late Sushant Singh Rajput
Whats the truth behind all this?
Come in todays video lets try to understand this
This is the live testimony of Sushants spirit
School for Ghosts
Do ghosts and spirits really exist?
There are places that are still feared by people
Its said that this place is haunted by ghosts at night
It is truly extraordinary unimaginable unbelievable
First of all lets keep aside the events that have an obvious reason
Such as the famous case of the Fox Sisters
In the 1800s in America
three sisters were very famous among the spiritual people
These three sisters were known as the Fox Sisters
And people claimed that from a very young age
these three sisters could communicate with ghosts and spirits
When people wanted to communicate with someones spirit
theyd go to these sisters
These sisters would ask questions to the spirits
and in response they could hear the walls of their room banging
Sometimes they would see messages on blank cards
Their spirittalking sessions
where they talked to the spirits
were very popular in America back then
These three sisters raked in a lot of money from this
But one day the husband of one of the sisters died
He was an orthodox Christian and believed these things
He told his wife to stop doing such things
to stop communicating with spirits
After the death of her husband the sister went into depression
She started drinking
And had a falling out with the other two sisters
One day this sister publicly confessed
that the three sisters were conning people for a long time
They didnt talk to ghosts and spirits
they were simply playing small tricks
Such as tying an object with a string and making it fall unnaturally
Sometimes hitting the walls with their feet to make the banging sounds
This sister claimed that people were so emotional
that people were willing to accept the delusion
people would even feel the spirits touching them
Another famous story is of the Amityville Haunted House
In New York there was a house called Amityville
a person named Ronny had murdered his family there
When this person was presented in court
he claimed that he could hear voices in the house
And that he committed the murders under the influence of the ghostly noises
After this another family moved into this house
The family of George and Kathy
They claimed to have heard these noises too
They started seeing ghosts
They witnessed paranormal activities in this house
and finally they had to leave the house
What was the mystery of this story?
Later news reports by ABC News showed that
they were lying
The murderer had lied to save himself from the punishment
And the couple that moved in later
lied because they thought that
they could earn some good bucks by lying
They assumed that they would get book deals and film deals
In India a recent example was seen
when a person named Steve Huff claimed
that he was communicating with the spirit of the late Sushant Singh Rajput
He recorded his conversation while talking to the spirit
and posted it on YouTube
And because many people were already emotional about this issue
They were misled
Several news channels reported on this as well
India TV Amar Ujala TV
DNA News24
as if what was shown in this video was real
But what had happened here actually?
As revealed by an Instagram user
this person took some clips from an old interview
where he was interviewed by film critic Anupama Chopra some years ago
audio clips were extracted from there
those audio clips were then manipulated
and played as if it was Sushant Singh Rajputs spirit talking
And surprisingly friends hardly did any news channel
run this news where the truth was exposed
Because you get TRP by appeasing the superstitious beliefs of people
They wouldnt get TRP by talking about science and logical things
So lets keep aside such fraudsters and false cases
where the lies were clearly evident
But what about the cases where people do not lie?
What about the films that are inspired by reallife incidents?
In 2017 there was a film called Veronica
In it it was shown that during a solar eclipse
Veronica and her friends go to the school basement
and use an Ouija board
to contact Veronicas dead father and her dead boyfriend
This ritual was interrupted by a nun
then the Ouija board breaks
and a demon possesses Veronica
She gets possessed
Interestingly this film claims that
it was inspired by real events
So did this happen in reality?
The real story is of a girl named Estefania
This reallife case drew so much attention
that even in the police report it was mentioned
that there were some paranormal activities at this girls house
If you watch such films
you might also feel that
since it is shown in so many films there would be some truth to it
Some elements of it would be true at least
It cant be that all of it is false
Especially when they write that the film is inspired by real events
But friends the point here is that people misunderstand the word inspired
Saying that it is based on true events
and inspired by true events are different
When the director of this film was asked questions about it
he had clearly said that
This is why the real story and the story depicted in the film
have vast differences
In reality according to the news reports
the parents of the girl were alive
In the film its shown that the girl dies within 3 days
but in reality the girl Estefania died several months later
after suffering from seizures
Third in the real story it cannot be ruled out
that Estefania suffered from a psychotic disorder
A disorder that went undiagnosed by a doctor
because they lived in a rural area
During the 1990s
Back then technology and medical science werent as advanced as they are now
And finally after Estefanias death
her parents had claimed to have witnessed paranormal activities around them
That they could hear their daughter scream
But when her mother was psychologically examined
it was revealed that she was suffering from emotional instability
anxiety and need for attention
I am going into the detail of this case
because we often come across such cases
This is a typical example of the cases that inspire horror films
Youd say that even if we suppose one family member had a psychological illness
but if the entire family behaves in such a manner
and claim to have witnessed paranormal activity
what would happen in that case?
Friends in such cases there is a phenomenon known as
Mass Psychogenic Illness
Also known as Shared Psychotic Disorder
We saw this in the famous Burari Case
which saw the mass suicide by 11 family members
It was a famous case from Delhi
I talked about this in the video on Monkeyman as well
The secret behind the mystery of the Monkeyman
Ill put the link to that video in the description
you can go watch it later
Another bizarre case was seen in an Australian family
where the family of 5 went on a road trip
and suddenly they suffered from paranoia
that someone was trying to kill them
Eventually the family members separated from each other and disappeared
Though they united later
this is said to be a case of Shared Delusional Disorder SDD
where people who are close to each other
often reinforce each others delusions
But if you are still interested in horror stories for entertainment

You can go try it out
But now lets talk about stranger phenomenons
Things that will shock you when you find out how these work exactly
First are these Ouija boards
They are spelled OUIJA
but its pronounced weeje
You would have seen them in numerous films
Exorcist Paranormal Activity Conjuring 2
Even in Indian films such as A Death in the Goonj
even in a web series on Zee5
It is basically said to be a medium to communicate with ghosts
There are alphabets and numbers written on this board
along with yes and no
And there is a triangular pointer known as Planchet
To use this people go to a dark place
light some candles close their eyes
and request the spirits to come to them
In case a spirit is around them they call it to communicate with them
Then the people place their hands on this pointer
And ask questions to the spirits
If the spirit wants to answer with a yes or no
then their hands on the triangular pointer start moving toward the answer
Friends it is interesting to note that
people do not move their hands on their own
Some people may be those that are just having fun with it
but there are many people who use the Ouija boards
but do not move their hands on their own
Their hands start moving on their own
Spirits can you speak to us?
Are you there?
And they believe that the spirits control their hands making them move
And that they are communicating with the spirits
How can this be possible?
There is a scientific phenomenon to this
Ideomotor Effect
Ideomotor Effect is a psychological phenomenon
where we move our bodies unconsciously
Without our conscious self being aware of it
For example our hand starts moving but we dont even know it
Often you would notice that when you go to sleep
moments before you fall asleep
you feel that youre falling
You slipped and now youre falling
And then youre jerked awake
This is known as the Hypnic Jerk
Your body moves unconsciously
It thinks that it is falling from somewhere
And that causes the jerk
A hypnic jerk is different from the Ideomotor effect
But they are similar
The difference is that you experience a hypnic jerk
when you are about to fall asleep
But you can witness the ideomotor effect while youre awake
If your hand is moving on its own on the Ouija board
this is an example of an ideomotor effect
Your brain signals your body to move in that way
but your consciousness doesnt even know this
If you want an example of this
you can experience this right now wherever you are
Take a pendulum
If you dont have that take a light weight and attach it to a string
It can be your button or your ring
tie it to a string
Since I have none of this let me use this charger for this example
This works like a pendulum now
Its oscillating already
What you need to do is
place your hand in front of yourself
And this weight is normally oscillating
Think to yourself that you need to make it move in a clockwise direction
Move it in the clockwise direction
And eventually youll see that it starts moving in the same direction on its own
This isnt working quite as well with a charger
because it isnt as thin as a string
But you can see the movement here
And now if you want to make it move in the anticlockwise direction
It starts moving anticlockwise without you needing to do anything
you arent moving it consciously
But since your brain wants to make it move anticlockwise
you can see it moving in that direction
Try it out for yourself
People who really believe in Ouija boards
who believe that they are really talking to spirits
their brain creates subconscious images and memories
of the person the spirit that has passed on
When they ask questions their brain uses those memories and images to respond
and their brain subconsciously tells their body to move
There have been several scientific studies into this
Theres a simple Blindfold Test for this
If a spirit was the one to move that planchet
even when people are blindfolded
when people have their eyes closed
the planchet should move in the correct way
But what happens actually instead of moving in the right way
the pointer gives absurd responses
If people do not know where Yes or No is
they start pointing the pointer randomly
We see the same ideomotor effect on people who claim that they are possessed
That theres a spirit in them
Not every case is a lie
if they think that they are possessed and start behaving so
it is actually possible that their body is making the movements unconsciously
without them being aware of it
Thats why they might think that they are possessed
Since their body starts moving without their control
It is the act of the subconscious mind
Similarly some people claim that they are gifted with automatic writing
That they can communicate with spirits
who make their hands move to write things
Its the same thing
Most of the people who make such claims are obviously lying
But the ones that are telling the truth
are victims of this ideomotor effect
But lets keep the ideomotor effect to a side
what about the ghosthunters that carry sophisticated equipment to catch ghosts
Lets analyse that as well
Often the cameras used by the ghosthunters is an infrared cameras
Which captures thermal patterns
They capture the spirits with these cameras
which makes it seem like a negative photograph
In reality friends whenever there is a change in temperature
you can see it quite clearly through an infrared camera
Think about it if you sit on a chair and
rub your back on the back of the chair
it will generate some heat
If you get up and see the chair with an infrared camera
it will seem like someone is sitting on the chair
When in reality the chair has some heat residue
Another interesting example is if you come out of the bathroom with wet feet
if you walk on the floor and look at it through an infrared camera
it will look like the footprints of a spirit
Because the temperature of your feet would be different than the rest of your body
Look at this interesting video explaining it in detail
Perhaps you are sitting around the dining room table having a sance
Calling on spirits from the past
when a pattern you might catch could be
someone that was sitting on a chair perhaps
Another thought that came to mind
maybe it was a crew member from one of those shows
leaning up against the wall
In this shot here my thermal reflection
as I walk across a wood floor in a home
could be mistaken for something else
In addition to this these ghost hunters carry an EMF meter with them
the EMF meter is an interesting thing
If you have a cell phone or twoway radio around you
or any kind of electronic device really
which emits electromagnetic waves
this meter would show a reading
from a computer mouse to a camera battery pack
anything can make this meter fluctuate all over the place
They use motion sensor lights often
Even if a mouse is passing through an abandoned building
it will turn on the motion sensor
and they will use it to claim that they spotted a spirit
By using these technical devices the nonsense thats often sprout
is presented on the TV as if they have really spotted ghosts
It is done in America as well as India
In many countries in fact
Theres a TV show in Aaj Tak Adhbut
Supernatural Unimaginable Unbelievable
They show some VFX with some background horror music
and the anchor Sweta Singh presents ghosts and spirits to people
Ages pass by but some questions remain unanswered
If these people can find a nanochip in the 2000 currency note
they can find spirits as well
But what can they do?
Showing ghosts on TV attracts TRP
Showing ghosts in cinemas earns them some nice box office collections
And now even YouTubers have started showing stories of ghosts
Actually it isnt wrong to do these
As long as these are presented solely as entertainment
I enjoy watching horror films
They give a different kind of thrill
The fear that it brings is quite enjoyable
But if a TV show film or a YouTuber claims that
they have definitely spotted a ghost
And that ghosts and spirits are real
it is complete nonsense
It is nice to entertain people
But to make false promises to people and to fool them
by encouraging superstition
is absolutely wrong
But what about the Dimple Kapadia case
that I mentioned at the beginning of this video?
Friends the thing is that in the film Lekin
Dimple was playing the role herself
The role of the ghost
Her character was based on it
When she experienced the ghost encounter
She went and told this to Padmini Devi the erstwhile princess
She replied that Dimple had been shooting the entire day as a ghost
so it wasnt out of the ordinary that it was stuck on her mind
which then caused the delusion
I said Listen Dimps the thing is
that you are shooting all day as a ghost
So therefore at night Im sure you woke up
and you thought that there was somebody else with you
Keep your wits about you when it comes to such things
