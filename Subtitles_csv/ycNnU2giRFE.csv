Speaker Gaurav Taneja So Sadhguru did you start participating yoga at a very young
Sadhguru What do you mean when I was young?
Im young man
When I was in the gym for about seven years every day I could run up a coconut tree
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Who showed you this path?
Sadhguru I told you Ive been a worm
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Maybe youre like totally free free bird and
Sadhguru Hey bird has bird brain
I got a human brain Laughter
Instrumental music
Sadhguru A hungry man has no civilization has no morality
Is that the world we want to create?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Lets talk about organic farming
Sadhguru If the entire country goes into organic farming our food production will
come to twentyfive percent of what it is
How many people do you think will die out of that?
Instrumental music
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Hi Sadhguru can you tell us about the place we are going to?
Sadhguru Ah were going to the farm where theyre doing treebased agriculture
Yeah and you can see how the land has improved in a just a few years
Speaker Gaurav Taneja I see a lot of young people in the ashram
Sadhguru Only young people only young people
Speaker Gaurav Taneja From childhood I have heard people around me say that yoga
and spirituality are things that you should pursue after your retirement or towards the
end of your life
But at the Isha Foundation I see so many young people
What is the reason behind this?
Sadhguru Spirituality is not when youre no good for anything
Its Laughs
At the very beginning of your life you must do it
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But it is often said that we should live the material part of our
life and explore spirituality at a much later stage
Sadhguru See that is because of the images that theyve created of spirituality that
it is something that is antilife
Tell me you can
Anything that you have lets say your phone or your motorcycle the more you know about
it the better you can ride it isnt it?
Why is that not true with your life?
The more you know about this human mechanism the better you can do it
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Sadhguru I had one this one question in my mind for which I could
never find an answer was  when I used to watch Mahabharata there was a saying that
everything is predestined and nobody can change what is destined
Speaks in Hindi  not transcribed On the other hand they would always say that Life
is in your hands you should always work towards  Unclear it is your karma
So I always find these two things as contradictory
Sadhguru No no no nobody said that
This is all losers losers in life explaining it like this
Does Krishna look like a loser?
So in his given context hes doing everything possible
Well a lot of things didnt work out as he planned but the thing is he did his best
Speaker Gaurav Taneja So what do you have to say about teachings that say that everything
is predestined?
Sadhguru See those things are said by losers who have nothing to show for their life
You dont want to accept your failures and do better you want to explain your failures
Oh explain it  youll never know success in your life
Speaker Gaurav Taneja So you mean everything is determined by karma?
Sadhguru No no no
Karma means its your action
Yeah when you say My life is my karma youre saying My life is my making
This is the most dynamic way to exist but now people have twisted it and made it Aiyyo
Karma is not something that you inherit kand ma
karma is in what youre doing right now
So what life throws at you is not always your choice but what you do with it or how
you hit it is your choice
Right now there is a corner that is the way it is but how you take the corner is
entirely yours
Lets say somebody goes and crashes in this corner
Now they say The corner was difficult
Thats not the point
You didnt know how to take it thats all it is
Thats so with every aspect of life
Thats what karma means its your doing
If you make it its you if you dont make it its you
This is the only culture which has looked at life like this
Everywhere theyre saying God  he is doing everything
If God is doing everything why the hell are you here?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja So Sadhguru did you start participating yoga at a very young
Sadhguru What do you mean when I was young?
Im young man
You got old hmm?
I started my yogic practices when I was eleven twelve years of age
And also by the time I was fourteen fifteen I was in the gym for about seven years every
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Besides yoga and flexibility did you also do a lot of stuff
like weightlifting and strength training and bodybuilding or going to the gym?
Sadhguru Not that kind of gym
I made sure that I were was? very lithe very strong
I could run up a coconut tree like that I was
So so for me strength and flexibility were more important than bulging muscles
So I kept myself very fit
Speaker Gaurav Taneja I also spend a lot of time in the gym working on myself
Sadhguru You dont have to s you dont have to say it I can see it Laughs
Instrumental music
Speaker Gaurav Taneja So we are here in this place for
Sadhguru is going to tell us what is
Sadhguru Treebased agriculture
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Treebased agriculture
Sadhguru And what it does to the soil
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Yes for me it is all same thing because for me
Overlapping conversation
Sadhguru Yeah because youre a A320
You dont know what is soil what is earth Laughs
Speaker Gaurav Taneja For me it is same
Agriculture means trees and plants
Like thats what we do in agriculture right?
We plant trees but what is treebased agriculture?
Agriculture is all about tree farming plants
Sadhguru Hmm
See right now the important thing is this
What is happening to Indias soil and the worlds soil is this the organic content
is going away
Because year after year youre taking out the crop youre putting lot of pesticide
youre putting insecticide youre putting fertilizer but no organic content
Why organic content is this whole process of life happens because of microbial activity
Even you youre a bodybuilder but sixty percent hmm?
Sixty percent of you is just microbes you know that?
Only forty percent is genetic material
Sixty percent is just microbial life within you
So the food that you eat you cannot even digest it without their help
Similarly here in the soil whatever nutrients that are there the plant really cant take
it just like that
It has to exchange with the microbes
So it has to catch carbon from the air make it into carbon sugars pump it here and trading
okay for what it wants
So this is a very sophisticated marketplace in the soil
A handful of soil has anywhere between seven to ten billion organisms
So right now what we have done is using the trees the green whatever the material
that is there in terms of leaf we prune it and put it back into the soil continuously
And there are also some animals with the animal waste also go into this
See now
Overlapping conversation
Speaker Gaurav Taneja  Unclear
Sadhguru it is notit is not rained in probably you know two twoandahalf
But you will see
Come youve never done this probably
Just dig here Im telling you
Is it wet still?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Yeah yeah
Its wet
Its wet
Sadhguru Look at that
Look at that
Thats rich soil all right?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja The texture is different
Sadhguru Because its always covered like this  with leaf
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Is this how it is supposed to be?
Sadhguru Yeah its good
Speaker Gaurav Taneja You dont see
when you go to fields you dont see covered with leaves
Sadhguru That is because theyre killing it
Speaker Gaurav Taneja No but if the leaves fall on the ground
Sadhguru They will sweep it
Speaker Gaurav Taneja They will sweep it
Because of the
Sadhguru No because there are no leaves
Where is the leaf?
There are no trees
Youre flying
Do you
Did you ever fly in India?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Yes all the time
Sadhguru Youre flying for a an?
Indian airline?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Yeah yeah
Sadhguru Okay
So when you fly probably for a pilot you cant look down
Speaker Gaurav Taneja You cant look down
Sadhguru If you look down you will see except Western Ghat and northeastern part
of the country the whole country looks like a brown desert
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Even this soil is different
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Haan
Sadhguru Its full of life
Overlapping conversation
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Microbes
Sadhguru If you increase the organic content here to eight to ten percent
Right now this may be around three to four percent
Speaker Gaurav Taneja This is three to four percent?
Sadhguru Yeah eight to ten percent if you make it your irrigation requirement will
come down to thirty percent of what it is right now
That is if youre using hundred liters of water thirty liters will do the same job
If you raise it to twelve to fifteen percent ten to fifteen percent of water will do irrigation
So just imagine 84 percent of Indias water is used for agriculture
If you bring it down to even twenty twentyfive percent of what it is therell be ample water
for everything
Right now were just plowing the land leaving it open
This is like peel off the skin stand in the sun you will be screaming
Land is just screaming
People dont hear thats all
Speaker Gaurav Taneja So youre saying only solution is plant more trees?
Sadhguru No no not only trees there are many ways to do it
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Okay
Sadhguru The important thing is the ground should be not ripped open with plowing
and left open to the Sun
Something should be there
There should be grasses there should be a crop
There should be some photosynthesis happening
So this leaf has come not just from the trees
They put cover crops and just chop it and put it right back here
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Okay okay okay
Sadhguru So with this the yields have gone up significantly
For farmers within lets say five to seven years many farmers are earning 300 to 800
percent more income
You must see this is a small farm its a recent one
These are all just five six year olds
You must enter a farm which is ten fifteen years old the water table has come up soil
organic content has gone up the nutrient level in the food has gone up significantly
Theyre getting a much better price in the marketplace
And above all the farmer is earning 300 to 800 percent more
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Sadhguru ji I have a question
It used to be Im saying it is supposed to be eight to ten percent whatever
We have by our own way made it down to three percent four percent
Sadhguru No no not 3 percent percent
4 percent
In India 62 percent of Indias soil organic content is below 05 percent
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Youre saying agricultural land or
Sadhguru Agricultural land
Speaker Gaurav Taneja  Unclear how much
Sadhguru Its gone below 05 percent
That means we are on the verge of desertification
Speaker Gaurav Taneja How many years we have?
Sadhguru According to the UN in the entire world there is only sixty to eighty harvests
left that is anywhere between fortyfive to sixty years max
Overlapping conversation
Speaker Gaurav Taneja  Unclear
Sadhguru By 2045 its expected we will be producing forty percent less food than what
were doing right now
And our populations will be over 9 billion 92 billion
Thats not a world you want to live in
Your two children they will be in that world if you dont turn it around now
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But the question was lets say 200 years back or 300 years
back the content was okay for
Sadhguru See
Speaker Gaurav Taneja for farming?
Sadhguru Im telling you
Not even that far away even fifty sixty years ago there was no farm in this country
without trees and animals
Now trees are gone animals are gone
Speaker Gaurav Taneja My
Thats my
My question is if everybody knows that Overlapping conversation
Sadhguru They knew
Speaker Gaurav Taneja that is more beneficial
Overlapping conversation
Sadhguru Not that they know they knew
Speaker Gaurav Taneja They knew?
Sadhguru Now weve forgotten
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But why have we forgotten?
If this is a more
better way to
Sadhguru See its like this
Youre eating good food and youre doing well the doctor checks you up and says Well
your calcium is not good enough
Your vitamin B12 is not good enough your iron is not good enough and gives you three
pills for a month two months six months something
You took these pills and you felt really good
Then you decided I dont really have to eat
I just have to multiply the pills
Instead of three I will take thirty pills
Thats what we did to the land
We put little fertilizer everything burst out
We thought this is it
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Yes
Sadhguru And farmers were advise advised like this
Speaker Thats true
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Everything that happened during the Green Revolution?
Sadhguru Yes it did
But we must also understand and appreciate why that was done
See India was a country which was suffering with famines
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Yes yes yes
Sadhguru Millions of people used to die
Speaker Gaurav Taneja We were importing we were importing wheat
Sadhguru Not only that
Every other year there was famine
So famines means in 1942 famine over three three million people died
So this used to be the reality of this country
To offset that to bridge that somehow then we went into Green Revolution
So it is like youre unwell you took some pills and you got well
But then you should have improved your nourishment
But you just started taking only pills thinking it will make you well
Those same pills are making you sick now
So we are not against fertilizer not against pesticide not against anything
The important thing is organic content should be there because first thing is right now
we are consuming the soil of the unborn child
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Yes
Sadhguru Were eating up the futures soil
So putting life back into this is the most important thing
Speaker Gaurav Taneja No
I read somewhere that you should leave the planet if not better
Sadhguru At least the way
Overlapping conversation
Speaker Gaurav Taneja in the same way
Sadhguru at least the way it came to you
Speaker Gaurav Taneja it came to you or you received it from your ancestors
But we are degrading the planet and then giving it to our
Sadhguru Super degrading it
Im saying just imagine
Just imagine
Where are you from?
Where you live?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja No Delhi
Sadhguru Delhi
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Delhi Kanpur
Sadhguru Okay Delhi Kanpur wherever
In your city suppose forty percent less food is available in the shop
Not that you dont have money to buy there is no food forty percent less food
That means forty percent of the people are not eating enough or they have no food to
What do you think will happen to your city?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Chaos
Sadhguru What kind of chaos do you think?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja The poor will die they will not get food
Sadhguru Really?
You think theyll die?
No no
When they see you a wellbuilt guy like you theyll slaughter you
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Yeah
Sadhguru Thats not the way its going to happen
A hungry man has no civilization has no morality has no humanity left in him isnt it?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja  Unclear
Sadhguru Well well push the world in that direction
Today UN agencies are predicting by 2035 therell be dozens of civil wars in the world
Is that the world we want to create?
But right now if we act we can turn this around in the next twelve to fifteen years
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Another question
I was working on this project of rainwater harvesting
I went around with Jal boards of different cities
But then theres a problem
See my videos are watched by people around twentyfive to thirty years of age
Now the best solution I could give them was it was costing them 50 to 55000 rupees to
build a system for rainwater harvesting on their roof so that you can replenish
But then theyre saying ki we dont have 50000 rupees to spend
The problem why it fails
We make a video people watch it yes theres a problem
They will say Sadhguru ji is right
Sadhguru No no no I dont give such
Overlapping conversation
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But but
Sadhguru I dont give that kind of solutions ever
Speaker Gaurav Taneja So what
Sadhguru Here Im saying this is not an ecological plan for the farmer
For the farmer this is an economic plan
But it has an ecological impact
So everything ecological we do is like this its an economic plan
Because if its not an economic plan itll anyway not succeed
They must make money out of it then only itll succeed and then only itll sustain
Okay even if I had 50000 55000 or 1 lakh rupees I spent it today
Will I spend it every year?
Whatever is needed?
It can only sustain if this becomes economically very good for me isnt it?
So this is about marrying economy and ecology
Otherwise there will be no success at all
Speaker Gaurav Taneja So youre saying farmers who are on the ground working on
their fields they should bring this change or a government policy change?
Overlapping conversation
Sadhguru No no no
Policy change is a must
Because see today this farm is good
This is one generation of people
Because we have worked with them theyve made their farms like this
But lets say next generation comes they may do their own thing
For you to see an example for example you live in Delhi the New Delhi is built in a
certain way
Because if you have let us say 10000 square feet of land you cant build a 10000 square
foot building
You build 6 7000 allow some space for yourself your neighbor
This is the law
You cannot do it
If you do more theyll come and knock it down
But just go to Old Delhi and see theres no concept of a window
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Mhmm mhmm mhmm mhmm Indicating agreement
Sadhguru One door entry one door out
All sides there are more homes there is no possibility of a window
All right?
Is that the way to build a building?
That happened when there was no law
So right now if you have twentyfive acres of land you can plow every inch of it and
turn it into a desert in the next ten fifteen years time
Nobody will ask you Why are you doing such a damaging thing?
Because theres no law
We need a law that if you own agricultural land you must have minimum three to six percent
this is minimum to keep the soil alive
If you dont live well thats up to you
But you cant snatch away life from future generations right now
Because once soil is gone theres no life left
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja But Sadhguru ji In that case farmers would say that you
know they will earn less theyre already earning less
Sadhguru Arrey Im telling you theyre earning 300 to 800 percent more
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Mhmm Indicating agreement
Sadhguru This is wrong education that weve given them right?
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Mhmm Indicating agreement right
Sadhguru Tell me if the soil is rich will you earn less or more?
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja More
Sadhguru If the soil is rich will you commit suicide?
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja No
Sadhguru 300000 farmers have committed suicide in India
SpeakerRitu Rathee Taneja  Mhmm Indicating agreement
Sadhguru If the soil was rich even if they dont have money if they can grow food for
himself and his family will he kill himself?
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja No
Sadhguru Then why are we not looking at it?
In United States today in the last twelve years fifty percent of the farmers have not
seen a single dollar
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Mhmm Indicating agreement
Sadhguru And the highest suicide rate among all professions is among the farming community
Its not just in India
This is because there is no strength in the soil
Your costs are going on because every year you have to keep on increasing the dosage
Overlapping conversation
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Yeah yeah yeah
Sadhguru of fertilizer and everything else
So costs are just rising by the year theyre not able to ta bear that
Otherwise if you raise the food prices other people will complain because inflation
they cant handle it
So the important thing is soil has to be rich
Soil should be alive because first twelve to fifteen inches of soil is the source for
eightyseven percent of life on this planet
When youre born you come out of it when you live you eat out of it when you die
you go back to it
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Mhmm Indicating agreement
Sadhguru This is the only magical place in the universe  not on the planet  where
if you sow death into it it bursts out with life
Tell me one other place like this
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Mhmm Indicating agreement
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Mhmm Indicating agreement
Sadhguru Lets make it happen
Save Soil
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But this is going to take at least two to three years of transition
period where farmers will earn less because
Sadhguru No no why?
Why are you
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Straight away from the next harvest they will earn more?
Sadhguru See because in your head it is stuck you must do organic farming
This organic farming is a crime committed by urban people
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Lets talk about organic farming because
Overlapping conversation
Sadhguru No no
Speaker Gaurav Taneja we pay so much to get organic foods
Sadhguru No no
Im not saying its not good
I am saying you never worked on the land
So suddenly you declare Organic farming
Right now if the entire country goes into organic farming without fertilizer without
pesticide without any of those things our food production will come to twentyfive percent
of what it is
How many people do you think will die out of that?
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Sadhguru thats what exactly I want to ask ki how to bring
this change?
Im telling you institute it in the policy first
If you
Like in the city there is a law
If you build a house there must be so much ventilation so much space whatever
Similarly if you own an agricultural land minimum three to six percent organic content
should be there
Speaker Mhmm Indicating agreement
Sadhguru If that is there you will use a certain amount of chemicals and stuff to grow
But if you increase the organic content to lets say six percent to eight percent or
ten percent then your fertilizer and everything will come down your input cost will come
Well you may take two three years to make this re
But that also can be offset very quickly within a year you can do it
If the government is willing to give some subsidy for enrichment of soil you understand?
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Right
Sadhguru See in Tamil Nadu we promoted this in the last twentyfour twentyfive
years Ive been telling the farmers ten percent of your land should be trees which
will provide foliage for the remaining ninety percent
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Mhmm Indicating agreement
Sadhguru If you dont invest that ten percent then everything will die
Now if you invest that ten percent you think youre earning less?
In the remaining ninety percent you earn much more than what you were earning with
full hundred percent
But we are not saying Dont use fertilizer
As the soil becomes richer the use of fertilizer will naturally go down
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Right
Sadhguru So we are not anti anything
This is not Dont use fertilizer dont do
These are things are said by urban people who have never done farming
Farming is a heartbreaking job
Once there is no necessary you know inputs to do that
See you dont have to do agriculture like its some kind of philosophy or a religion
This is not what you believe in
This is about making a practical solution out of this
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Right
Sadhguru Im just saying dont cut the golden goose
If I have to say it very simply wait for the eggs to come Laughs
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But its scary to listen to the timelines what you have told
2035 will be desert
Overlapping conversation
Sadhguru See right now we are partnering with UN CCD
Thats a agency UN agency for combating desertification
Desertification is the biggest problem in the planet right now
Nobodys talking about it because theres no money in it
Everybodys talking about fossil fuels automobiles coal this one that one because if you knock
industry it spills dollars
Here you cant go and knock anybody you have to spend your life to make it happen
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Exactly
Sadhguru To convert about 125000 farmers to to treebased agriculture in Tamil Nadu
and Karnataka twentyfive years of our life is gone in this
Speaker Gaurav Taneja With no reward
Sadhguru Not that there is no reward
Speaker Gaurav Taneja No to the people who are volunteering
Sadhguru No they dont look for a reward
They want to do it
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Mhmm Indicating agreement
Sadhguru Whats a reward?
Were alive and were happy thats a reward Laughs
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Mhmm Indicating agreement True
Sadhguru What other reward is there in life?
You want a crown Laughs?
Very uncomfortable damn thing to wear just know that Laughter
Can you imagine a metal ring on your head?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja I always used to wonder that in our epic
Sadhguru Its a terrible thing to wear Laughs
Speaker Gaurav Taneja It is shown it is of gold
Sadhguru See right now youre wearing a helmet its properly cushioned everything
that only irritates you after some time
Speaker Gaurav Taneja After some time  Unclear
Sadhguru Just a metal ring metal ring you put it on your head and walk around
Thats the silliest thing to do
So were not looking for a crown Laughs
Rich with life its reverberating
The land thats how it should be
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Mhmm Indicating agreement
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Sadhguru ji where do you do so much research?
Do you read?
Sadhguru No no I dont do any research
Overlapping conversation
Speaker Gaurav Taneja You have a lot of
Im not talking about what you tell about spirituality life
Sadhguru Even the soil
Overlapping conversation
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But this soil tree seeds
Sadhguru this is because you know for six and a half decades I have lived on this
Others dont live on this planet they live in their head
I dont have anything in my head
So I live on the planet
Im like a worm
You ask a worm it knows what is the soil condition isnt it?
Do you think the worm in this soil knows more about this soil than a scientist?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But it cannot tell us
Sadhguru No this worm can speak
Thats the only difference Laughter
That worm also speaks youre not understanding the language
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Yes maybe Sadhguru laughs
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But it is strange to see that what is affecting our life what
is affecting our children we are not
Because nobody
Sadhguru See
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Even when I heard about I was talking to swami ji
He told me about all that
Desert its going to turn to desert and the fruits and the vegetables itself if the
soil doesnt have any nutrition
Overlapping conversation
Sadhguru It has nothing
See right now its a fashion to eat salads in America
Speaker Gaurav Taneja No even in India
Sadhguru But for example
Speaker Gaurav Taneja I eat salads
Sadhguru All right
You eat salad?
Youve been eating a buffalo Laughs
So in California especially its very fashionable
But one important item
This is the only thing which has been studied
If you study everything itll all come out
Lettuce for example
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Okay
Sadhguru It has only ten percent of the nutrition it had hundred years ago
In 1920 if you ate it what you got today youre getting ninety percent less
Youre eating trash
This is what weve done to our food
If you ate one orange in 1920 today you will have to eat eight oranges to get the same
Can you eat eight oranges?
Even you cant eat
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But then people in 1920 must be starving
You cant
The amount of food you eat amount of space you have in the stomach you need
Sadhguru No if the food is rich you dont need that much quantity
Right now people are eating much more than what they should eat because it lacks nourishment
Speaker Gaurav Taneja I thought it is because of the volume it satisfies the hunger
Sadhguru No no that is also there
See what level of activity  physical activity  people were putting in 1920 and what level
of activity youre putting now is not even ten percent
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Right
Sadhguru Everything had to be done with your body
All right?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Now we have machinery
Sadhguru So we can think its like you know in the petrol
Whether you want to ride with a hundred octane or you want to ride with fifty octane its
a big difference Laughs
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja So you know what happened Sadhguru?
One day I was flying with another captain even Im a captain
Sadhguru Oh youre also a pilot?
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Yes Im also a pilot
Im with Indigo airline
So he told me about you
And one day I was on layover and then I actually tried to do Isha Kriya
Although I failed at it but yes
Then I started following your videos and your ideology
Sadhguru Hey I have no ideology
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Not exactly ideology but
Sadhguru Simply life sense
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Haanji life sense
But yes like
my father tells me this every time
See like as a child needs a teacher to you know guide in a certain way my father
told me that a person needs somebody
I mean like for me its you
Sadhguru See flying an airplane its such a simple damn thing
If you just pull it it will fly
But if there was no trainer you think you would have?
Youd be dead probably
Isnt it Laughs?
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Exactly
Thats what my father tells me
Sadhguru Any unknown terrain if you want to walk
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Sadhguru ji question comes that okay so many people follow you
You are the trainer who shows them the path
Who showed you this path?
Sadhguru I told you Ive been a worm
Ive lived on this planet absorbed life
Speaker Gaurav Taneja No but Ive seen so many of his videos
He never answers this question Ritu Rathee Taneja laughs
Sadhguru Do I look like I was trained by somebody?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja No I dont know
Im asking
Sadhguru No no just tell me looking at me Laughs
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja I didnt feel like
I feel like that maybe youre like totally free free bird and
Sadhguru Hey bird has bird brain Ritu Rathee Taneja laughs
Dont tell call me a bird
I got a human brain Laughter
Instrumental music
Speaker Ritu Rathee Taneja Speaks in Hindi  not transcribed Its very sweet
Sadhguru Yes
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Because the soil has micro
microorganisms right?
It has more nutrition?
Sadhguru Definitely it has
Those neat looking agricultural lands lines and lines they are not good lands
Unfortunately weve advertised like that  thats how land should look
No this is how it should look  full of vegetation
Instrumental music
Sadhguru Farmer is living a quiet nice life with a house family settled
Both his children are welleducated now
All from the farm
Speaker Gaurav Taneja But Sadhguru ji you know she is from Haryana a farming background
But the main problem is everyone is sending their kids to cities
They dont want them to be farmers
Sadhguru Unfortunately yeah
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Even a for
Sadhguru We have made some kind of a rudimentary survey
Not even two percent of the farmers want their children to become farmers
Speaker Gaurav Taneja And even for they want
Sadhguru Yes
That is a thing just imagine in twentyfive years if this generation passes where is
the food security for this country?
Speaker Gaurav Taneja Are you taking the same bike to ride in Europe?
Sadhguru Europe Im riding a GT 1600
Arabia Im riding this
From Tel Aviv to Oman Im riding this
Instrumental music
Sounds of Isha music  Soil Song Lalale Lale Lale
