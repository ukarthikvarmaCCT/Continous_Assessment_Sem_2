In this video
were going on a 250000 vacation
This is beautiful
How is this real?
And Im going to show you the difference between
this and a 100000 presidential vacation
Right this way sir
A 50000 vacation where we have the Eiffel Tower
completely to ourselves
Im holding on for dear life
All the way down to this 1 vacation
Right over here boys This shack is our vacation
You can see inside of it  Theres no walls Jimmy
Well I mean there is walls  This is gross
And in case you dont believe me its a dollar
Look at that  Oh its 093 Youre a liar
I rounded up to a dollar For 1
we get this bed which is honestly just a mattress
sitting on wood planks
a broken cabinet a light that sort of works
Oh look at that
And lastly random noises coming from the ceiling
I was hearing noises in the room and theres a raccoon on our roof
I feel like most people would be mad if their hotel room had a raccoon
But for some reason were happy
When is the check out time?  Tomorrow
Keep in mind that later in this video
were going on a 100000 vacation
A 250000 vacation
Can we just jump to that already?
No because we got to suffer
so they can compare our suffering to our happiness
They do like when we suffer
Are we all supposed to fit on a single bed?
If we wanted four beds thatd be 4
First lets get all this sand out
The raccoon just ran in here
Im gonna act like I didnt scream like a little girl
Up next
a vacation thats 10000 times more expensive
Welcome to the 10000 a night vacation
Oh my gosh  Yo this is sick!
Wait what the heck is this?
This hotel room has jellyfish
Okay thats so unnecessary  Oh theres a pool outside
Its a private pool
Does this not look like a scene from a movie?
Your hotel room walks out to the beach
Wow  Is this our own private beach?
Oh my gosh
This is incredible
Tareq since when is water this blue?
I dont know
This all inclusive vacation also has a giant spa
Oh yeah
A park filled with flamingos
Oh theyre fighting
Flamingos  And unlimited room service
Okay what do you need?
All of it
The only negative of this place is it doesnt have a raccoon
Hey little guy
But I dont blame them for that
When you spend 10000 at this all inclusive resort
we each get our own floor of the building
It looks exactly like Jimmys except for I got the top floor
Oh I have a hammock
I think I can make it in the hammock without getting wet
I didnt
Yo look at your view!
Chris!  Hey
I caught it
3 2 1  Hey!
All right let me lay out some rules
Rule number one  Yeah
No more throwing pillows in my pool
Rule number two
Sorry Tareq And now what the hotel is known for
this insane infinity pool
that extends over our own personal beach
How does the water just not overflow?
I have so many questions
I feel like a father that took his kids on vacation
and is just watching them hang out in the pool
The 10000 vacation has been insane
but not as insane as our next vacation
all the way across the planet
And now the 50000 vacation in Paris
Oui!  Baguette!
Our 50000 vacation
starts with a completely private luxury ferry ride
What is that? Thats the engine?
Bro what is this 1805? Tareq zoom in on that guy
He is filming us Hey
They waved back  Do you have a YouTube channel?
I dont think he speaks English
This vacation comes complete with fantastic food
A tour of the entire city
All right
And a luxury hotel room with an amazing view
This is kind of romantic huh?  Yeah
You and Chandler should kiss
And lastly we have a very expensive surprise
So you guys are probably wondering
its a 50000 vacation
and we clearly havent spent 50 grand yet
Yeah where is it?
Its behind you
Thats the Eiffel Tower
Yes We have the entire Eiffel Tower completely to ourselves
Wait actually?
What portion of the 50 grand was the tower?
Almost all of it
We are at the Eiffel Tower
This feels like were sneaking in
No Im not joking Its ours No one else is here
We can just go straight through the line
This feels illegal
Most of the time this place is packed with people
And because we have the whole thing completely to ourselves
were going to try to get to the top of the tower
Im talking the very top
Boys enough playing around Lets head up
On the way up
we stopped at the first floor over 187 feet in the air
where we had a world class restaurant all to ourselves
I love though even though we have the entire Eiffel Tower
they still put us in a corner of the restaurant
Thats the elevator
coming from the top of the Eiffel Tower
That looks terrifying Open sesame
Thank you I can see my house from up here
Were in France
I can see my hotel from up here
Look how high up we are  Oh my ears are popping
What are we working with here?
Oh my gosh
You can see the whole city from here
This is crazy
Tareq Look how much higher we have to go
This is never going to end
Im not going to lie I thought we were already at the top
Were going up
Now were heading to the top At one point
this was the tallest building in the world
Should I jump right now?  No Do not move
Come on boys follow me
From here on out theres no more elevators just stairs
Oh its windy up here
We are high up there Oh my God
Oh my God
Tareq dont drop the camera
We are standing over 900 feet in the air
The highest point civilians are allowed on the tower
But since its ours for the night I had one last surprise
What do you thinks behind this door?
Actually did I
How did you know?  We can see the stairs
Well yes there are more stairs
but this takes us to the very top
where no ones allowed to go
Oh my gosh
Oh my God
Are we allowed on that?  I dont know
Oh that is scary
The ledge just comes up to my waist up here
I am holding on for dear life
I completely understand why tourists are not allowed up here
We have a cameraman on the other side of the city
with a lens zoomed in on us
Hes over a mile away
If this lens is good enough
you should be able to see us waving for a 50000 vacation
You got to admit this is cool
This is amazing
Ita a once in a lifetime experience
Are you ready for the best moment yet?
I dont know why a YouTuber has this much power but lights
Oh there we go
Oh my God
Like a disco show
Holy cow!
Guys I dont know if this next command
is going to work but turn every light off
Oh its pitch black
The Eiffel Tower went dark
What are these millions of French people thinking right now?
They should get me off this tower
I dont know why they gave me this much control
Next we head to Switzerland for the 100000 vacation
But this is no ordinary vacation
This hotel has two inch thick bulletproof windows
a panic button that will lock down the entire building
and its riddled with security because this is a hotel
where world leaders and presidents take their vacation
And also the sidemen were in town So I invited them to come
Oh my God
It smells like food in here
Weve got the whole ocean in there
What?  This is nuts
This is the most expensive penthouse suite in all of Europe
It covers the whole eighth floor has dozens of rooms
tons of staff waiting on you day and night
and absolutely crazy food everywhere
You want a hit? Yeah get a hit of that
Oh yeah
How do these guys compare to your normal guests?
So youd say theyre pretty dumb compared to
Like I said before some of the most powerful world leaders
choose this place for their vacations
Even Bill Clinton stayed here and he wasnt assassinated
Its pretty safe
In terms of security here you have the bulletproof windows
Even this is bulletproof
Oh my It feels thick
Pretty solid
I hope Im a president
There are also some snipers
that we can put on the rooftop
You have your own snipers
Are you able to negotiate on behalf of the Sideman?
I can try my best  Yes
This will help me in my negotiation
Id like to buy a 10
How much boys?  Go you say it
200 million Jimmy
200 million
All right To the panic button
Oh no  Im not going to lie
Ive been wanting to press this button since we got here
We all agree this is a good idea
No  No
Karl Youre Bill Clinton and you feel threatened
Press the panic button You pressed it
Oh wait
I see a door closed  Are we locked in?
Is it locked?  Are you guys in there?
Is that Nolan?
Yeah The doors like shut
I walked off for one second
This button opens it
You dont get to panic and then open it
If you press the button now
the police will come
And theres a big fine
Dont press it again
Ive been thinking
How would a president get somewhere like McDonalds?
Lets see how presidents travel Come on in
It turns out when youre the president
you have to go everywhere with your bodyguards
So that means that when you drive
Oh we got an entourage
How do we know which car to get into?
On the third or the fourth
Ideally the third or fourth
Which car is the most dangerous?  The first one
Nolan you should ride the first one
I can do that  Okay
Who wants to ride with me?
Harry come on in
Harry Chandler
Im sure the president doesnt sit in the middle
Typically you guys would be my bodyguards
But you know youll suffice
Just squeeze in mate Squeeze in
What president is going to McDonalds?
Does your window roll down? Hey hows it going?
Now were gonna get shot!
I cant believe we can do this
This is nice
Turns out when you travel in a presidential motorcade
a lot of people start to notice you
Hows it going?
This is bonkers man
I love how we just draw the attention of everyone
People are filming
like were the president This is weird
Which made McDonalds a little awkward
Whats going on?
Dont mind our security
Jimmy does this beat out the Eiffel Tower for you?
Depends how good these nuggets are
Obviously all of the vacations
so far have been amazing
but they pale in comparison to the next one
Our final vacation is once again across the planet
And now were in Japan for the 250000 vacation
and were meeting up with a special guest here
so youre gonna want to watch till the end
To start off our vacation
we dropped off our bags in the most expensive hotel in all of Japan
This is gigantic
I have an echo in a hotel room
And afterwards
we felt like getting to know the city of Tokyo
Now were going to drive Mario Karts on the street
We rented private Mario Karts
but we get to literally drive on the streets of Japan
People are just staring at us
This is not meant to be on a street
Theres real cars driving right beside me
Well look how many people are crossing the street here
This is the busiest
crosswalk in the world and were driving right through it
Were on Gokarts in Tokyo Gokarts!
I love Japan
This place is crazy
When we arrived at our next destination
we met with master swordsman Yoshioki Sumida
Hes been training with the katana for the last 26 years
and he actually agreed to giving us a rare lesson
in the art of the Samurai
We each got our own katanas
and the lesson began with swinging techniques
It was not as easy as we thought
No theyre going to zoom in on it
Then it was my turn
Boys you think Im gonna be able to do this?
Yes  Yeah you got it
Hey! Lets see how the boys do
Whoa whoa whoa!
Who am I?
And then our samurai teacher gifted us this insane katana
I dont deserve this but thank you
And because this is a quarter million dollar vacation
we rented out the most premium sushi chef in the world
along with this entire floating restaurant
They got Louis Vuitton coasters
The chef makes all the food right next to our table and getting to see
a master at work was one of the coolest dining experiences
Ive ever had
Oh wow
Oh my God
They said we could feed the birds tuna
Here you go little man
See how he caught him in the air?
And once we paid the bill
Thank you
we were off to the craziest place Ive ever been
Follow me I rented this whole place
But before we see it socks off
This is basically an art museum but for experience
Oh my God
I have goosebumps
My eyes are having a hard time processing it
You think this is what it looks like when you die?
What is this next room?
Normally this place is completely full of other people
but we secured the entire experience for ourselves
This might be one of the best things weve ever done
Dude are these fish?
Were in a pool
in a museum playing with animated fish
This is the most unique thing you could ever do on a vacation
Wait the fish are surrounding us
How did they know to surround us?
They love us
Theyre going everywhere now
Now youre all probably hungry
Which is why were at this restaurant that is ran by robots
My name is Pepper
Can we have a seat Pepper?
Sure Lets find a comfortable spot
Weve reserved the entire place
so the only other people here were the robot waiters
Food robot is here
Wait so the food is delivered on a robot?
An oddly fluffy robot
Pepper staring really hard at Chandler
Pepper does not like Chandler
Bro I did nothing to you
Everyone make sure you eat tons of food
cause tomorrow I rented an entire theme park
and PewDiePie is going to be there which is really crazy
You see PewDiePie and I have a long history
I was wondering when you would show up
We helped him in a subscriber race against Tseries
Grab your phone
Go on YouTube search PewDiePie and subscribe to him
Eventually we even caught up to him
Mr Beast has taken over me in subscribers
I guess Im getting a taste of my own medicine
Thats all right He definitely deserves it
And even though weve been friends for a while
weve never actually met in person
And because this is such a long awaited meetup
I rented this entire amusement park
This is FujiQ Highland
the park with the scariest rides in all of Japan
It usually has thousands of people waiting in line
But as per usual
I rented the whole thing just for us
You can ride whatever ride you want
I wasnt done but he left
Im about to go on this entire roller coaster alone
What youre seeing here is the steepest roller coaster drop
in the world
Are you scared?
Yes  Have fun!
Im scared for him
And like I promised
the father of YouTube PewDiePie met us in the park
A little later than planned because I texted on the wrong day
Sorry Felix
And he wanted to ride the craziest coaster at the park
Why are you scared?
Im so scared of roller coasters
This is one doesnt spin at all
Ill ride it if Felix rides it
Lets go!  Im terrified
Ill do it Ill do it
If I die on this roller coaster you guys are going to feel terrible
You take your shoes off?
Anything that could fly out  Thats how you know this is bad
They dont even trust us with shoes on this ride
You got this Youll be fine
I cannot
This was my worst nightmare
Im scared I dont want to do this
Youre scaring me Calm down!
Whatever you do dont throw up
Im terrified Can we pick a better one?
We could have picked a nice comfortable ride
I actually have no idea what it is
At some point theres a literal 90 degree drop
Youre freaking me out What did you sign me up for?
You brought me here
But what we didnt know was
this ride goes backwards
Why are we going backwards?
Why did I do this?
Oh my God Were upside down!
This is crazy!
Best roller coaster ever!
Oh my gosh
Felix what did we just do?
Im crying
Best roller coaster ever
I got tears just running down
It was good meeting you Jimmy Im gonna head out
Oh yeah
You screamed at the first little bow
Thank you
I dont think Ive ever had a chewy potato before
Thats what you get for passing me
Felix Im sorry for passing you
You dont have to threaten me with violence though
Theyre good  Yeah they are good
That was the 250000 vacation
Felix can you transition us?
Bro fist
