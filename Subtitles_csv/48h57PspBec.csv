This is a 1 billion super yacht
and its big enough to hold an entire city on the water
How do humans build this stuff?
And Im gonna show you the difference between this
and a 300 million mega yacht a 50 million giga yacht
all the way down to this 1 yacht
Why did you sell me this boat for a dollar?
The storage just kept racking up
Yeah  18000
Its cost you 18 grand a year to store this?
Correct  Interesting
Here you go  Thank you
And after stepping on board
it was pretty clear why this yacht only cost 1
Okay now that were on the water
what are we working with in here?
I dont think the floors supposed to do that
I dont know if this is even worth a dollar
Oh were actually sinking Oh
The boat literally started sinking
right when we put it in the water
Oh my God Lets go
We gotta go up Were sinking
Jump Chandler
My baby!
I paid a dollar for that
That was the 1 yacht
Later in this video we have a 50 million yacht
a 300 million yacht and the 1 billion super yacht
But before all that heres the 1 million yacht
which is a little smaller than I thought it would be
Hop on boys
All right  Lets see the inside
On the 1 million yacht
you get a surprisingly big living room
a lower deck with a master bedroom
another bedroom that I cant stand up in
and then you got some double beds for the kids
Wait you have kids?
Chris Chandler Karl Nolan
Dont worry boys I got this
Coming on the break to break
Please stop Someones gonna send a rescue boat
We need the coast guard
I wonder if I turn this if hell fall
This is fun
For a million dollar boat Im not gonna lie
its a little smaller than I thought
Lets see if these guys watch our videos
Oh my God its Mr Beast
Hey he has seen our channel
Thats pretty funny
So now were going to the 10 million one
10 million?
See ya  Its gonna be great
Oh my God Hes fast
And now we are on the 10 million yacht
Lets check this out
Holy crap the front of the boats huge
Its just way bigger than the last one
Look at the view
Im getting some good sun here
Im really pale
Oh my gosh Yes this is a nice bedroom
For 9 million more I can actually stand up
And right down these stairs are four more massive bedrooms
Why are there two toilets side by side?
Oh thats a bidet Jim
For your butt?
You poop in here
and then you wash your butt in here
Why dont you just use toilet paper?
Youre so American
And upstairs is another seating area
Oh my gosh
The seats on the 1 million yacht were leather and hot
These are actually soft
Soft and practical
This boat is the nicest boat Ive been on so far
Well just wait until you see the next one
Its massive
And because its so massive I invited all my friends
Go have fun  Go go go
This boat is meant to hold 150 people
Theyre gonna have a lot of fun
Whoa  Oh my God
This is wild
What is the difference between this and a mansion?
This is a mansion
When does it stop?
Jimmy Im still going
This is definitely the nicest bedroom weve seen so far
And its nice because my head doesnt hit the ceiling
I can barely touch it now
This yacht has a living room an office
a massage parlor two dining rooms and seven bedrooms
This is the best yacht Ive been on so far
Im driving the boat
Its not Feastables
Its not Feastables
Thank you for saving
my life  Youre welcome
No way
You gotta
Hey buddy are you relaxed?
Yeah I was
Are you done with your massage yet?
Here you go take a bite
Thats some good chocolate
So we got all of the goon squads in here
This is a 25 million boat with 30 rooms
Why are you guys in here?
This bed is so comfortable
Even though this yacht comes with a world class chef
the boys still wanted pizza
So I planned a little surprise
Do you know what were standing on boys?
A boat  A hospital
An H  A boat
A helipad
And Uber conveniently does helicopter deliveries
That cant be real
Oh its real
Is that a helicopter?
I cant believe its actually works
Pizza pizza pizza
All this for some pizza  Woohoo
Pizza pizza pizza
I am terrified of parallel parking
He just landed a helicopter on a moving boat
Who wants some pizza?
I know youre not supposed to swim
after you eat a bunch of pizza
but youre on  Jump
a 25 million yacht
Which thankfully when you pay 25 million
you can get some jet skis
Tariq flipped the jet ski
Yo Mac Catch this pizza
Oh Oh
25 million yacht and Im the only one enjoying it
If you thought this yacht was crazy
look at this video of the 50 million yacht
You know what?
Honestly lets just go to it right now
Zoom in
And now we are on the 50 million yacht
This yacht is over 200 feet long four stories high
can hold over 200 people and comes with a 20 person crew
with this homeless person I found
Sup guys?
When you pay 50 million
youre given this remote that can call the crew
at any time you call me
Sir did you call me?
No I just wanted to show how this works
But thats not the only thing the remote does
They said this TV goes up and down
Thats cool
That is slow dude
Maybe its like
Im gonna go downstairs
you guys go upstairs
Tell me if you find anything cool
Okay  Okay
Bro it is massive
Its like a whole nother boat up here
Jimmy theres nothing cool up here Dont worry
This is crazy
The interesting thing is Ive just been walking
and I dont know if Im at the halfway point
the end of the boat or if I just started
This things huge
Meanwhile Nolan overslept
So he was still trying to find us
Have you seen Mr Beast?
Yeah  Yeah
Are you lying to me?
Apparently Pete Davidson is there
If I dont see Pete Davidson
Im gonna sink the 50 million yacht
Meanwhile we noticed another boat was approaching us
and then the owner did this
I was waving at him and he showed me his butt
Thats gonna be someones dad one day dude
All right catch
Where are they going?  Gimme that gimme that
Are they backing away from us
or are we just that much better?
Get em
This is the best  Oh
Oh  Oh
The guy thats bigger and stronger than all of us did it
Wow Chucky
I wonder what kind of food they got on this yacht
I heard they have lamb
They do not have lamb
Mmhmm  No
Cut to the dinner
Oh man  Whole lamb
Thank you so much
Its really good
What projects
do you have coming up?  Uh Ooh Im very excited
I have a show called Bupkis
coming out on Peacock on May 4th
Three days before my birthday
And while Nolan was still trying to find us
Which direction did Mr Beast go?
We noticed a lot of boats
surrounding our floating billboards
I didnt even know you could put billboards in the ocean
And we thought they might want some chocolate
Im delivering chocolate
Yo you guys want chocolate?
Lets do this
Oh my gosh
Best chocolate Ive ever had
Lets go  Its so good
Yeah  Let know if this is
the best chocolate bar ever
Oh my God Out of 10 its an 11
Hersheys dont know nothing
Hersheys doesnt know nothing
Everyone agrees its better than Hersheys
You need to try it
Tell me what you think
Honestly way better than Reeses
Thats what I like to hear
What do you give it?
A 10  Im flying Feastable bars
to people
Aye Feastables incoming
Oh no  Let go of the string
One Feastable bar delivered
Hey Karl
theyre trying your gummies
If you wanna try the best chocolate bars cookies
and gummies on the planet?
Go to Walmart 7Eleven or any Albertsons stores right now
or go to feastablescom right now if you wanna order online
Hey what do you think?
This is amazing
This is better than every other chocolate
so why wouldnt you get Deez Nutz?
I agree Put our nuts in your mouth
Oh Alright
At the end of the day Nolan finally found us
We had another five star dinner
And the next morning we boarded
one of the worlds largest yachts
This is the 300 million yacht
and it has over 50 crew members
waiting on your every request
Tons of luxurious rooms
and nine master bedrooms
Oh my gosh Great
Welcome aboard
I literally cant see the top of the boat from here
We are the 69th
largest yacht in the world
Is that a factual statement?
Yes it is  That is crazy
There are six floors a massive pool
and a hot tub with a view
This is nice
Its ridiculous
Its my favorite boat so far
The 300 million yacht comes with a stateoftheart gym
that overlooks the ocean
Oh what?
Dude if my boat had a gym Im working out
A movie theater with windows that auto darkened
whenever you watch something
And even the table is worth 3 million
and the piano plays itself
I want one of these in my house
All the boys disappeared in the spa
Come with me
Oh youre getting a haircut?
Yeah Karl was in the sauna
Are you alive?
That does not look comfortable
And I dont even know where Nolan is
Oh its so hot
Man really got in a hot tub
with a sunburn  Its too hot
Dude theres more downstairs?
Whoa  Oh my gosh
You think they have enough jet skis?
Whats behind this door?
Oh Im doing this
One of us is getting thrown off the side of the boat
He was last  Bye
Hey always always be ready for nose goes
Jimmy can we eat some food?
Yeah when you get back
Boys we must act like rich billionaires
Would you rather have 300 1 million ships
or one 300 million ship?
You could almost have one
for every different day of the year
Im not gonna take care of 300 boats
Which would you rather have?
300 boats or one big boat?
You want the big boat?
Gentlemen did any of you notice a boat pulling up?
On that boat might be Tom Brady
By might I mean it is
And we should probably go say hi to him
Lets go
Hey Tom  Whats up guys?
And if you dont know who Tom Brady is
he is the number one quarterback in NFL history
So this is where you get your haircut on the boat
So it turns into a dentistry  Where you wash
Clean your teeth too
Is this the nicest boat
youve been on?  My God are you kidding me?
Yeah  Its crazy
if you eat too many Deez Nutz bars before breakfast
I literally had to hide them in my house
because I knew these two would sneak
to right where theyre at  Yeah
I did This place is so fun
Its really an endless maze
I think its a nicest boat in the world
Thats what we do  Its so beautiful
Its crazy  We still have more floors
to go on  Tariqs the master
of the camera
Thank you thank you
This is a way nicer helicopter pad
When I think of a helicopter pad on a yacht
this is what I think of
Not what we had before
And with Tom Brady here of course
we had to play some football
This is the most fun version of catch
cause you just do this and he just throws it there
I just suck
Thats what I got paid for Jimmy Come on
I wanna see if you could hit my drone out of the sky
Oh no  with a football
All right if I hit the drone on the first try
maybe I should come out of retirement
I like that  Dad youre gonna like miss
I probably will miss
First try
Go go go  Oh
He got it
Nolan put your sunscreen on
Karls probably the worst
wide receiver youve ever thrown to
Unless you dome him in the head
hes probably not gonna catch it
All right Karl dont screw this up
Just throw it as far as you can
You hit him in the chest
You gotta hit him in the head  Its a bad placing
After chilling with Tom Brady
we hung out in the movie room for the rest of the night
Would you say this is the best boat so far?
100  But keep in mind
theres still a billion dollar boat after this
How big can that get?
It is four times bigger than this boat
These things get bigger?
This ship is bigger than three statues of liberty
Holy crap
You cannot fathom how massive this ship is
It is literally a floating city
that is 1200 feet wide and 17 stories high
and it fits almost 10000 people
In all the other ships we had our own rooms
but this ship has over 2000 rooms
This boat has water slides an indoor mall
a basketball court and tons of other stuff
I cant even name
I ran out of fingers
All of which we have to ourselves
Have fun boys  Yeah yeah
Brother its that way
Oh okay  Lets see what happens
Whoa theres a water slide
Theres a whole entire waterpark up here
Im breaking the rules
Were running were running
Sorry lifeguard
They literally have live music in the waterpark
What the heck?  Theres even an entire
sports floor that has everything you can imagine
Mini golf  Lets go
Were literally playing mini golf on a ship right now
And I wasnt exaggerating
when I said this ship is a city
Theres literally seven neighborhoods on this ship
This is insane
Were still on a ship
And just for reference this is what one
of those neighborhoods look like
So I went down to the slide
and now Im teleported into like a different world
And you have a carousel?
They have shops restaurants arcades even a Starbucks
Hey Chandler
Hey  A hundred million people
are watching
Lets see if you make the shot
This is crazy
Like how can I use all these seats?
Im only one person
And apparently theres an entire floor
for indoor shows and events
What is this bro?
We got the whole ship to ourselves
selves selves selves selves selves selves
Obviously I dont need this giant ship all to myself
so I wanted to share this experience with you guys
my subscribers
I love Mr Beast
Subscribe to Mr Beast
Holy cow this boat
Its actually pretty nice
Lets go boys Lets get it
Were gonna go ride the carousel
Carousel carousel
Whered Chandler go?
And just when we had thought we had seen everything here
What is this?
How do humans build this stuff?
Also in this giant mall inside of this giant ship
theres a bar that comes down from the ceiling
Wait what are those robotic arms?
Thats our bionic bar
Oh its all right buddy
Oh  Oh
Whoo Woohoo
This is sick
From the kids menu
