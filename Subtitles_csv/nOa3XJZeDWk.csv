Hello friends!
On 1st January 2024
when the world was celebrating  the beginning of a new year
Japan was hit by a terrible 76magnitude earthquake
In Western Japan scenes of devastation
are emerging after a 76magnitude earthquake
shook the country
k!lling dozens of people
This earthquake was not alone
Numerous earthquakes small and big followed this
In total more than 155 earthquakes
occurred in just one day
Because of this sea waves about 1 meter high
hit the west coast of Japan
Japans meteorological agency
had also issued a major tsunami alert
Although this warning was downgraded later
but the earthquake itself  caused substantial damage
Dozens of buildings were completely destroyed
Electricity was cut off for thousands of houses
Some places were engulfed in flames
And as of 2nd January
55 people have been declared d3ad
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida says that
this situation is a battle against time
Rescue operations are underway
and efforts are being made
to save the trapped people
But on 2nd January
another unfortunate incident  took place in this country
A Japan Airlines airplane
crashed with a Japan Coast  Guard aircraft in Tokyo airport
Thereafter both planes caught on fire
Japan Airlines plane has caught fire
at Tokyos Hanida Airport
And all runways
at the airport have been closed
This Japan Coast Guard aircraft
was getting ready to help  people affected by the earthquake
Fortunately all the people in the other plane
were evacuated safely
But 5 out of 6 crew members in  the Coast Guard aircraft lost their lives
The 29yearold plane captain
was the only one who could survive
Two big questions arise here
First why are there so many  earthquakes and tsunamis in Japan?
Second how does Japan  deal with these disasters?
Because if an earthquake of the same  magnitude had hit any other country
perhaps thousands of people  would have lost their lives
The d3ath toll in Japan is  below 100 as of now
How does Japan protect itself against such circumstances?
Lets understand this in this video
The earthquake that just hit Japan
is named the 2024 Sea of Japan earthquake
or the Noto Peninsula earthquake
You can see its exact location  on this map on the screen
Theres a region called the Noto Peninsula in Japan
You have read about peninsulas in school
It is a piece of land
surrounded by water on three sides
The epicentre of this earthquake was located here
The Sea of Japan  in the west of the country
It is 500 km away from Tokyo Japans capital
But even so
this earthquake was felt in Tokyo
Now our first question is
why do so many earthquakes take place in Japan?
The answer to this  is hidden in the map
Look at this map
This is the map of the Earths  16 major tectonic plates
Tectonic plates are the outermost layer of the Earth
made up of the Earths crust  and the upper part of the mantle
The heat that is generated in Earths core
releases convection currents
which causes the tectonic plates to move slowly
These are the 16 main tectonic plates
that move slowly year after year
When they collide with each other
earthquakes happen
So the countries and the areas
that lie on the boundaries of the tectonic plates
are prone to earthquakes the most
And the thing about Japan is that
it is situated at a place where
four tectonic plates come together
The Pacific plate the Philippine plate
the Eurasian plate and  the North American plate
This is the biggest reason why
so many earthquakes are seen in Japan
Among them the Pacific plate stands out a bit
Since it has the highest amount of tectonic activity
So the boundary of the Pacific plate
is known as the Pacific Ring of Fire
Because this causes the highest  number of earthquakes in the world
As well as the highest number of volcanoes
To some extent this is true for the other plates as well
And the countries located on their boundaries
witness a higher frequency of earthquakes
For example if you see Indias northern boundary
the boundary between the Indian and Eurasian plates
that passes through Nepal
amidst the Himalayan mountains
this causes devastating earthquakes in Nepal
The earthquakes in North India
in Delhi and its surrounding regions
in most cases their epicentre
lies between these two plates
Compare this with regions like  Australia Russia or Europe
where you rarely see any earthquakes
When was the last time you heard about
a terrible earthquake in Australia?
Its not like there have been  no earthquakes in Australia at all
But the regions that lie in  the middle of the tectonic plates
get earthquakes at a lower frequency
And when earthquakes do occur
they are not as devastating
And the reason behind this is that
these major tectonic plates are  made up of minor tectonic plates
And at times the collision  between the major tectonic plates
can be felt even in the middle of the plate
But depending on the way  that these main tectonic plates
collide with each other
various types of boundaries can be formed
Such as the Convergent boundary
when one plate collides and slips under the other
Or Divergent boundary
where both plates move away from each other
Or Transform boundary
when both plates move parallel against each other
Among these the most dangerous earthquakes
occur when convergent or  transform boundaries are formed
And the boundary of the Pacific plate
is a convergent boundary
It has a specific subtype
known as the Subduction Zone
In the Subduction Zone
causes the most powerful earthquakes
because in this type of collision
when one plate collides with another
it goes right under the other
submerging into the mantle
And when this happens
as you can see in the diagram
a deep cavity or hole is formed under the sea
on the boundaries of the two plates
which is called a Trench
These underwater trenches are  often the deepest point in the ocean
They can be 3 to 4 kilometres  deeper than the surrounding seabed
The deepest point on Earth in underwater
known as the Mariana Trench
This trench is 109 kilometres deep
In Mariana Trench the point Challenger Deep
is the deepest point in any ocean and on Earth
You would have heard about it a lot
But perhaps you might not know that
There is a deep trench in the East of Japan
known as the Japan Trench
The depth of this trench is 84 km
There are very few countries in the world
that are located so close to such deep sea
Look at this map
This map shows you
the depth of the sea in  different parts of the world
The lighter the colour
the shallower the ocean
And the darker the colour
the deeper the ocean
Look around most of the countries
Indian coastlines
African coastlines
South American coastlines
they are shown in a light colour
But zoom in and look at Japan
On the right side of Japan
there is a massive dark area
This is the Japan Trench
And through it crosses
our imaginary Ring of Fire
The Pacific Ring of Fire
Due to the movement of the tectonic plate
such horrific earthquakes are caused
the sea is so deep here
most number of volcanoes are found here
and due to this
the area that gets the most  number of tsunamis
is the country of Japan
Japans coastline is very close to this trench
which means that the tsunami waves  have to travel only a short distance
and there isnt sufficient time for issue warning
For this reason
Japan is at the highest risk from tsunamis
In fact the word tsunami
is derived from Japanese
is made up of Tsu and Nami
Tsu means harbour
and Nami means wave
meaning harbourwave
Harbour is also known as a seaport
Since there were so many tsunamis in Japan
when the news of the Japanese  tsunamis spread all over the world
the word tsunami became popular
and people started using it since then
Approximately 90 of the worlds earthquakes
take place in this Pacific Ring of Fire
And approximately 75 of active volcanoes
are also found here
Since the geography of this area is such
historically Japan has always been
in a danger zone
But perhaps this is why Japan
has been at the forefront
at controlling the damage caused  by earthquakes and tsunamis
What does Japan do exactly?
Before talking about it Id like to tell you that
if you want to learn more about Japans history
there are amazing audiobooks on KUKU FM
such as this one talking about Hiroshima and Nagasaki
It is a 15 hour long audiobook
that tells you the story of  the nuclear bombing of the two cities
Apart from this there is an audiobook on
Oppenheimer The Father of The Atom Bomb
There are numerous audiobooks  on KUKU FM across various topics
Whether it is fiction history geography or politics
Overall it is an amazing audiolearning platform
where you can listen to books
In case you havent already
do check it out
theres a link with a big discount in the description
And now lets get back to the topic
The buildings built in Japan have to  meet strict earthquakeproof standards
There are three standards
The lowest is the Taishin standard
The requirement mandates the
minimum thickness of the pillars  walls and beams of the buildings
So that if an earthquake shakes the building
the building can resist it
Second is the Seishin standard
which is recommended for tall buildings
where they are required to
install dampers to absorb the earthquakes energy
They need to put large thick rubber mats  under the foundation of the building
These rubber mats absorb the  vibrations of earthquakes very well
But there is a third standard  which is even more strict
the most advanced standard the Menshin Standard
In this the entire structure of the  building is isolated from the ground
Layers of lead steel and rubber are installed
so that the building moves independently of the ground
Even if the ground shakes  the building can remain stable
This iconic Skytree tower in Tokyo city
was built using the same standard
This is one of the most earthquakeresistant buildings in the city
When the horrific Tohoku earthquake hit Japan in 2011
the magnitude of that earthquake was 90
This building did not even get a scratch
On the other hand
Japan has adopted many strategies  to protect itself against tsunamis
although they havent been as successful
as those protecting Japan against earthquakes
They have built tsunamicontrolled forests
Planting a large number of trees
to stop the force of tsunamis
They have built coastal dikes
which look like this
These are long structures built of stones
These dikes are very expensive to build
but they can successfully reduce the impact of tsunamis
Apart from these tsunami evacuation towers are built
In areas with a highrisk of tsunami  and a significant population
since people do not get a lot of time for evacuation
they are told to take shelter in these towers
located at a high point
to be protected from the tsunamis
They have improved their warning systems
Evacuation drills are regularly conducted
to help the locals understand
what they need to do in case of a tsunami
And how to prepare for rescue operations
And finally they have built walls near the sea
Sea walls
Japan has a 22000milelong coastline
40 of which is surrounded  by these concrete sea walls
But unfortunately these walls  are not always effective
As it happened in 2011
Watch this video
The earthquake that caused this tsunami
was the most powerful earthquake in Japans history
This tsunami caused the  Fukushima nuclear disaster too
Nuclear reactors were damaged
leading to radiation leaks
that spread over the Pacific Ocean
The 2011 earthquake and tsunami
was the most devastating in Japans history
Around 20000 people lost their lives in it
After this their government made their standards stricter
Thankfully this years disaster
did not turn out to be as dangerous and fatal

The most dangerous nuclear disaster in the world
It is explained in this video
Thank you very much!
