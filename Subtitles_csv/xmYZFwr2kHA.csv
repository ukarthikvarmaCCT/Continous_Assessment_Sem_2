Normally we dont attend many events but
today would be the first time well be attending an event
with many YouTubers and creators
It would be quite exciting to see
This is the Nas Summit
This is why were back in Dubai
This is the largest gathering of international content creators
in the last 2 years!
This time our hotel is quite close to the metro station
so well take the metro for the first time
and see how Dubais metro is
Who actually cycles here?
Therere so many cycles
Look at that
Emirates Tower
Theres even a gold class on this train
Book it! Oh you did not book it?
Its weird Oh true
So overall this metro is quite similar to Delhi metro
So many things are the same
The visuals that you can see from the train
What happened? Keep going
I shouldnt be filming in such crowded places
It attracts too much attention
Ill be filming today okay? Great
We found Mohit and Sandhya on the way
Hi! Hi!
Oh wow this is the hall where everyone will sit
I was wondering in a hotel how is there a place for 700 people
It is more crowded than I expected it to be
There are so many creators
And several people actually recognise us
Snacks snacks Snacks?
Yeah Okay
Food food
We have no idea about whats going on here
Who are the ones getting such an energetic welcome?
Okay so my name is Matt and this is Belik

Greenlands biggest YouTuber is also here

it gets a truly amazing view of Burj Khalifa
So we met Ranveer Allahbadia aka Beer Biceps
Hes really hyper today Is this the vlog?
This is a video now for our vlog

so I was thinking
So how is it going? Are you having fun?
Im tripping out
This is how Julis puts her voice in the vlog and all that its crazy
Love it
Okay Im telling you hes so hyper
Look at this what am I supposed to think about this?
Theres some serious bromance going on
Everything youve seen on Beer Biceps vlogs
hes even more hyper in real life Yeah
Because Dhruvs sexiness is 100 times more in real life
He is quite sexy online
but he is even sexier in real life
Im just expressing my man crush
I mean I dont disagree its just
Another interesting thing
normally the fans that I come across are from India
but here I met a viewer from Myanmar
Im interested in the topic that you are saying like geopolitics

I just know the topic that you are saying
but I dont understand you
So I have been following you Yeah yeah but you can use subtitles

I swear that was such a brain fog
Im backstage before the panel discussion
Technical Guruji and Carryminati are already here

Lets begin
Vlog section
Make sure you turn your phone towards the people the viewers want to watch
The video would turn out great

With hands You have to speak fast
Actually Ill tell you a secret I speak very slowly
And I speed up the videos later

Im the opposite people have to slow down my video to watch it
This is Technical Gurujis phone
This phone deserves an unboxing video
Whats on here?
The theme here is Space
These pieces 123 These 6 pieces here

This is all solid gold You designed all of this?
No it was by the company that made it Caviar
Oh wow
This is solid gold?
Yeah thats why its so heavy
Hi So youre gonna have your panel discussion
Are you nervous at all?
Because Im nervous on your behalf
No its not a very complex topic or something
But its been a long time since Ive been on a stage
The last time was with Kunal Kamra in 2019?
In Amsterdam?
Amsterdam yeah
Since its been a long time Im getting some stage fright
Its easier to speak in a video
But to speak on a stage is tougher in comparison
This was a small backroom
Like they show in films
a place for actors to get ready
We had gathered here
and then this is the way to the backstage
All the best! Thank you
That looks like the backstage
Ill be going up on a stage after a long time
Guess whos coming on the panel now
There he is!
Hi guys my name is Dhruv Rathee
and I make explanatory videos on a variety of topics
and I have around 7 million subscribers
Things change like that!
In 2 days the world will change
I will say that probably the only thing you can say for sure
is that more and more people are going to come on the internet right now
So if its only 50 of the Indian population
soon you will see 6070
Once more people come then
you will see that there are different markets within India also
based on the language they speak
