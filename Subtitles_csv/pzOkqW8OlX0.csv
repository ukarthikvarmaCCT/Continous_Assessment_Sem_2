just like hindi and bengali yeah no hindi bengali and english these are the three languages thats
a good mix um and you can communicate with a lot its like good news thats so cool though so um

like some practice yes yes yes um thats cool and then do you how long have you been using gambling

um and so i had another question for you oh youre yes yes im in school right now
um im in class eight
okay can you hear me if those are the same hello i can hear you can you hear me
um yes yes i can hear you now okay can you hear me okay yes i can
yes okay so can you tell me where are you from yeah so im um my name is tori
and im 22 yeah um im from the united states so i am from tennessee which is like the
southeast of the us and i was born there raised there and i stayed there all the way up until
um i graduated college so lived in nashville i lived in one city for my whole life and then for
college i moved to another city in the same state and went to college there um so i studied spanish
and education so i can speak spanish as well um and i lets say oh i graduated last april and then
i worked in the us kind of as like a spanish teacher for a little while and in september
i moved to spain so i live in spain now so right now youre a spain yes yes thats nice its cool
its really cool i grew up somewhere really really small i grew up in a super like super tiny town
and then i moved to madrid which is the capital of spain and it is like a huge city by comparison and
so its been really amazing for me i feel like theres like so much to do and so much to see
all the time um so i really like living here and here i work as an english its i work as like a
language assistant um teaching english and i work with like really really really young children
so i work with fouryearolds and i dont like colors and letters and
how to write their names um all of that different stuff and then im studying
my masters degree here as well so busy busy busy yeah i like um
are an inspiration to me because i also live in a really really small town and yes
i have to go to a huge city after you know i graduate maybe or i have to move to some
huge city afterwards so yes im also a little bit scared about what is going to happen over there
yeah well i was so scared about moving here because i had never visited spain before
but its been fun its its a good experience to like be away from my
family and like have to be independent and so if youre thinking about like studying abroad
or just like going and traveling for a little while um i would definitely recommend
do you know so i know that you said that youre only uh in eighth grade but um do you have idea
what you might want to do when youre older um well not really i say um i would go in the path
of science because i really really love science um but after that i dont know what im going to
become whether in the research line or medical line or i have i will think that in the future
oh yes you have a lot of time you have a lot of time but you said that you like science so do
you like like biology or like chemistry um biology biology is my favorite subject ever thats so fun
i am horrible at science so i really respect that because whenever im trying to think about
how old i was when i had to take biology for the first time i think i was 15 and ive always been
like really good with the rest of my classes and i remember i think i made like a c in my biology
class or something and i was so upset about it because i i just like could not my brain could not
understand some of the stuff that i was learning um now i think its like a little bit more
interesting um my like partner he works in the sciences and hell like explain things to me some
yeah well you know if you have a little interest in it then
yes yes right totally
yes i can hear you i cannot hear you can you hear me oh no i can hear you yes what about now
hello hear me
oh no yes yes can you hear me now okay okay yes yes okay its fine now
what were you saying just like being interested in it do you feel like it
makes it easier for you to like learn some of the stuff because you like it
yes yes of course because you know when youre interested in a subject you automa
automatically get addicted to it and yes it works because like uh thats me in history
that you said you are in biology because like in history like i dont understand that even
a little bit of it what is happening so well yeah you know sometimes i do get a little bit
of interest and i love to read it but most of the time it is like just memorizing the stuffs
yes history is also really hard for me because of the like memorization for us like we would have to
memorize all sorts of like years and oops dates that stuff happened and i okay i could not tell
you now anything that i learned like in history class um but thats cool thats cool that you at
least like have an idea and you know what you like and that kind of thing um because i think whenever
i was in school like when i was your age i had no idea what i wanted to do when i was older so if
you have an idea it like helps kind of guide your path um and you were saying you wanted to move
have you thought about like studying abroad um can you do that in like high school there um no not
really i have not really thought about it right now um i would see where my destiny takes me but
um well lets see what happens because you know if i get some you know there are some scholarships
and all that so if i get that maybe i will move there but maybe after graduation just not afraid
i understand and do you think um what was i gonna ask oh have you ever traveled outside of india
yes yes a lot of places like um china and then europe i have traveled a lot of places in europe
then dubai maldives um then bali singapore yes is awesome thats so fun you traveled to many more
places than i have have you ever visited the us no i havent but im eagerly looking forward to visit
it because you know ive heard a lot about it and i also know a lot geography about it so where are
these popular places and all those so yes i am really looking forward to visit it someday yes
yes no have you ever um visited spain too have you ever visited spain at all no i havent oh
its okay its okay spains a really cool place to visit um i think even after i move away from here
ill probably come back and visit like just like a tourist because its a super super cool country
um thats really cool that youve been to all of those places and i think that like the next
im a teacher i dont think im ever gonna get rich but whenever i save up some money
i would really like to travel to asia um because i are like southeast asia because i talk to so
many people all the time from like japan vietnam like thailand all these different places and for
people in other parts of the world its like super cheap to travel to somewhere like thailand and so
um i need to save up some money and go because in the culture i mean even where youre at in india
its so different than like the culture that i grew up with and it really interests me and um
like being here in spain even its still very westernized so its honestly like some things are
different than they are in the us but some things are and so i would like to visit somewhere thats
like really different you know yes because in india everything is different from the us
like you know the culture is totally different over here our eating styles everything is
different our clothing habits everything asian countries have a lot in common i would say
like you know japan um then thailand india china and all of these they have a little common
but um well id not say that they have a lot of common with the western countries
yes exactly exactly and thats the thing like europe and the us kind of have together but
anyways we only have like 40 seconds but it was so nice to meet you and to talk to you
um yes i hope that you have a wonderful rest of your night
yes you do awesome thank you bye bye
