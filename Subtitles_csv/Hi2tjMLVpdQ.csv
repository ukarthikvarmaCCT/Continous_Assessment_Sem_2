how i love rechargeable batteries its
not really funny all right iphone 10 why
why is that your choice i love the
hardware on this phone the speakers are
great the cameras great i legitimately
really do enjoy face id this is like the
best hardware ive ever tried on a
smartphone like i love the pixel 2
but im excited okay hey man this is
your moment like im not going to
interrupt you you make your case right
that doesnt bother me theres so little
that i dont like about this phone do
you consider yourself to just be an ios
guy like its going to be hard to break
away from thats not it so what was the
last android device you used extensively
that was
its like my main phone yeah
okay so thats your theres your answer
theres your answer all right moving on
who wants to be next thrown in the fire
into the flames of the tech world its
linus tech tips hi how many videos did
you make a ces 45 45 videos round of
applause everybody
who is this man
and what is he made of
which smartphone is in your pocket and
why so im on the pixel 2 xl my galaxy
s8 something i have installed on it is
making the battery drain really fast i
havent had the time to deal with it are
you trying to say you preferred it is
that on my trip i actually have five
phones with me i can give you the
reasons for all of them this one im on
because i popped the sim out of the mate
10 pro there was some software that
wasnt installed on it i needed to use
so i put my sim in here you sound like
the most reluctant pixel user ive ever
heard in my life
its okay oh so youre not a big fan of
it yeah
round roblox
its good its really good i love the
i havent used a phone for longer than a
month at a time in over half a year part
of my deal is i switched the eight i was
using the a plus the pixel 2 not the xl
this was the last one i was on before i
switched to the razer phone which i
frankly didnt like that much so the sim
went back in this one if you could put
any one of them in your pocket not not
the most convenient at that moment which
one would it be im really happy with
this one okay so what is this one
sort of
look at these hands i cant handle this
much phone
so really what i want is the s8 back but
with not my batteries how about this in
the form factor of just the pixels yeah
thatd be fine yeah i like this watch
better than i like my phone
i want to be fed to the lines next
if were talking pixel then were
talking me a pixel 2 xl and if you guys
have been following me in this recent
trip how about this view ive taken
pictures of this view and i truly
believe this is the best camera on a
smartphone right now period i have not
taken a bad picture with this phone plus
i like stock android and all the usual
things that you know about this is in my
pocket for now theres no lies here it
either is or it isnt
all right whos next
judner youre next man the pressures on
iphone 10 wow its just two phones so
far im gonna be straight up its
imessage man in the ecosystem whoa
thats what it is for me i dont even
know what this means this imessage thing
its not about the blue and green okay
what is it about im always on my
computer always on the phone somebody
hits me up usually its a family member
whos also on imessage i get it wherever
i am yeah i mean you could do the whole
haircut a lot of things
some other messenger you know a lot of
the world they use whatsapp for example
yeah i mean ive got that comment a lot
yeah but its like okay
i gotta tell you go download something
what would it take for you to switch
over i message on android honestly i
mean thats not gonna happen obviously
but yeah what are we sitting at right
now three to two oh
cant wait a hotly anticipated take from
the man himself mkbhd what did you have
you had a smartphone awards uh the best
phone the best this the best that it was
a lot of bests but i think what the
people really want to know is whats in
the pocket whats in the pocket and why
which pocket first of all because i do
firing back right now you have two
phones yes main sim card the number you
have this phone number pixel 2 xl naked
pixel 2 xl panda the colored power
button stock android great camera all
the same reasons you said fingerprint
reader is in a good spot i have big
hands so i couldnt even use the smaller
version of this phone im a big phone
person if theres an xl thats where im
going but the other pocket i do carry an
iphone oh can you believe this are you
running for president next there are
things that just work better on ios i
use the best iphone i can i use my
favorite android phone wow this diplomat
right here came prepared pick a damn
phone right now if you had to drop one
is that it im dropping the iphone yes
there it is there it is
no cop out in here no compounds in here
i dont like this whispering
collusion just two phones in the whole
room what are we sitting at now three
three tie breaker happening now mister
whos the boss whats happening
so no preamble no banter i came from the
note8 i couldnt stand it because of the
battery and pixel 2 the great the screen
is not fantastic
you kind of get used to it show someone
a meme they might comment on this like
blueness but its not terrible the pixel
the pixel is better in every way 4 3
pixel 2 xl to iphone 10 i got gotta be
honest im a little disappointed that it
broke down that simply theres a lot of
amazing phones out there maybe this says
something about us maybe were a little
too predictable maybe we need to get out
there a little more often im not really
sure this has been incredible this is
unprecedented i dont know maybe you
want to see something like this next
year you people there in the audience if
you do i think you know what to do you
use your thumb to let jack know that
thats the case i want to say thank you
to everybody thats been in this video i
hope to do it again that is the
smartphone thats in their pocket no
lies its the real deal here in las
vegas ces 2018 yes
oh its good its good its really good
