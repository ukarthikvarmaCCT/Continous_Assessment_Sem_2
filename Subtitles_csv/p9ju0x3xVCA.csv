Hello friends!
10 Million subscribers
1 Crore people
Its such an unbelievable number
its more than the population of countries like Switzerland or Norway
First of all a heartfelt thank you to all of you
You made it possible you took us to this milestone
Secondly I decided to do something special for this occasion
In the history videos we discussed several historical events
So I decided to take you into my past
I wanted to show you my childhood videos and tell you stories from my childhood
those that I have never shared before
Come in this video let me take you on a journey
into my life
This story begins in October 1994
I was born in Rohtak Haryana
to a small middleclass family
My parents were quite young about 2425 years old
My mother was a teacher
and my father was an engineer
Together they earned about 4000 per month
There werent many videos back then
because video cameras were rare then
There are some photos like these
but I hid my parents faces for privacy
Friends in my childhood I got to travel a lot
Though I dont remember any of it
because I was a weaning infant
But there are several photos
from the snow in Srinagar  to Jaisalmers desert
This is because my maternal grandfather worked in BSF
Youd know that if a family member works in the army
they are frequently posted in numerous places
All across India
This is why when my parents would go to meet my maternal grandparents
they got to visit all these places
Of course I do not remember the first few years
My earliest memories are from Rohtak
Playing in Rohtaks lake
and playing at my paternal grandparents home
Some years later my parents moved to Delhi
for better job opportunities
My father was offered a better job at a better salary
They told me that around 20022003
their salary was around 17000 per month
There was a big turning point in life in 2003
when my father was offered an even better job in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia
And so he moved to Malaysia
But my mother my brother and I didnt go there
because though the salary offered was a lot
but it wasnt enough for the entire family
with the increased living expenses
it wouldve cancelled out the salary boost
So we lived in Delhi but once a year we went to Malaysia
So during the summer vacation
I got the opportunity to visit abroad for the first time
That was my first foreign trip
We lived there for 1 month during the summer of 2003
There were new experiences in the new country
I remember eating a waffle with maple syrup for the first time
I loved it
And this was the first time I got to play with Lego
Lego had a large impact on my life
as youd see later in this story
But it was in Malaysia that our family bought our first digital camera
So there are some videos from then
Like any other 89 year old child
I had a lot of free time
And friends this was when I made my first video
Yup thats right
The first video was in 2003
The thing is that we had a computer
and we recently bought a new webcam for the computer
Youd recall that the internet was very slow back then
When my parents wanted to talk to each other from Malaysia to India
they used Yahoo! Messenger
The dialup internet
Video calling was a recent addition to it
you could see the person you were talking to
Though the internet was so slow
that the video was heavily pixelated
I dont know what was the resolution of the webcams back then
perhaps it was around 240p
But I learned one thing from this webcam
perhaps my father taught me
you could click on it and capture photos
There was a button
I learned that if 24 photos were placed one after another
and played them successively
it could create a video of 1 second
I learned about the concept of frame rates
What is 24fps?
Basically in a 1second long video there are 24 photos
This was a mindblowing fact for my young mind
Because I realised that I could create animated films
You remember playing with clay right?
I created characters with that clay
and kept a white sheet as a background
and used the webcam to take a photo
I moved the clay character a bit and took another photo
Move a bit more and took another photo
And eventually I took about 5060 photos
And created a 12 second long video
In which these clay characters were seemingly moving on their own
This is known as Claymation
The video was like this
You werent expecting much were you?
I was a child of 89 years
What more could you expect?
Like other kids of that time I enjoyed reading comics
Specially Tinkle comics
That was my favourite
Of course I enjoyed watching cartoons on TV back then
Mowgli is eating a banana here
Oh no! Someone is setting the tail on fire
Oh! It is Mowgli
Who else could it be?
Popeye was my favourite cartoon back then
Id say that my obsession with eating healthy stems from here
One should always have spinach and other vegetables
Its unfortunate that the cartoons presented to children nowadays
often unhealthy food is promoted in them
A cartoon promoting laddoo
Fortunately vegetables and spinach were promoted when I was young
You wont believe this but since I was 12 years old I havent had any soft drinks
I stopped drinking soft drinks like Pepsi and CocaCola at 12 years old
because I was obsessed with eating healthy
2008 when I was around 1415 years old
reading became a passion
I loved reading books
The credit lies solely with Satyajit Rays books
At this point in time had you asked me
what I wanted to be once I grew up
I would have answered A criminal investigator or a detective
This is because I loved the Feluda series
I read these detective stories every single day
And it kept playing in my head
Of course soon I realised that
today detectives werent the same as depicted in novels
After a little research on the internet I found that
most private detectives hired nowadays
were hired to catch cheating spouses
And the serious investigators working with the police
didnt work the same way as written in the books
Overall a terrible career option
Around this time I developed an interest in Mechanical Robots
You need to turn this to make it move
Light sensor
And the touch sensor is on the bumper
Press this here
My parents had bought me this set that I absolutely loved
These Lego blocks could be used to create robots
with touch sensors and light sensors
They could be programmed
I was so obsessed with it for hours that
I made my own robot programmed it
to carry a digital camera
so that whenever it hit something
it would activate its touch sensor
and it would change direction and continue going forwards
I wasnt born a genius
neither was I a talented child
If you see the marks I got at school
I was an aboveaverage student
I got about 7080 at school
I believe that if any child is given such toys
and if the child spends enough time with these
anyone could build these things
And thankfully there werent any social media to distract me
Or to waste my time
Which allowed me to spend time on these
Fast forwarding 2 years in 2010
In 2010 had you asked me what I wanted to be once I grew up
I would have answered a host on National Geographic or Discovery Channel
At this time the programs on these channels were my favourites
Like Bear Grills Man vs Wild
Or the shows on Travel and Living Channel
where new countries and hotels were explored
Luckily Im doing something similar on my vlog channel now
I believe myself to be very fortunate to get this opportunity
But back then I had no idea about how to choose this career option
How did one get to interview with the TV channels?
If one wanted to choose this career path what was to be done?
What should one study?
I had no idea
In December 2011 Anna Hazare Arvind Kejriwal and other social activists
began protesting against rampant corruption all over the country
Media gave a lot of positive coverage to these protests
Something that is impossible to imagine nowadays
Any protest getting such positive coverage
But friends this began my interest in politics
The sole reason
Because friends in my family relatives
even among the farflung relatives
theres not a single person
that has any connection to politics
Zero political connection
This is important for the people spreading misinformation about me
that I have a connection with such and such political party
or that so and so family member is in a political party
theyre lying
Before 2011 I had zero interest in politics
Traditionally in most Haryanvi families
2 professions have been the most common
Begin in agricultural or armed forces
Youd see this in my family too
Three of my close relatives are in the Army
My maternal grandfather and 2 uncles
Several people are involved in agriculture
In fact it was rare for my father to be an engineer
Anyway getting back to my story
After 201213 my interest in politics deepened
When the AAP government was formed in Delhi for the first time
Arvind Kejriwals famous 49day government was formed
And when Narendra Modi became the new Prime Minister in 2014
my interest in politics deepened further
Like many people I was delighted to see the Congress government lose power
A person who promised to bring back the black money within 100 days
to end corruption
back then my political ideology
was 100 anticongress
I hated the Congress party
because that was the narrative set by the media and TV channels
It was only later that I found out
the level to which the media could fall
But even before that it took me only a few months
to realise the misdirections
Black money wasnt going to come back
In fact RTI was going to be diluted
Foreign funding for political parties was going to be legalised
Corruption began at a larger scale
but it would be hidden
Media would be bought
Seeing it happen in a bought of frustration
I published the initial videos on YouTube
But enough about the politics
But the very first video published on the channel
was a travel vlog in 2014
To understand how that came to be
lets rewind to 2012
That was the year I completed my 12th board
I got 85 on it
My philosophy was always the 8020 rule
Though I didnt know about the 8020 rule then
but I always used this subconsciously
I believed one should study only to get a good enough score
That would be sufficient to show people that
youre a good enough student
But not to expect a topper
I realised that if you had to study for 2 days to get 80 marks
you had to study for 8 more days for the remaining 20
It means that its quite easy to get 80
But it is increasingly difficult to take it to 100
It takes a lot more effort
Why should I put in the extra effort?
I wasnt interested in being a topper
Youd say that its important to get into good colleges
or else you wont get admission
Youre right but
I wasnt very interested in going to topnotch colleges
And thankfully there wasnt any pressure from my parents for this
My parents were content with me not being a topper
because I was good enough at studies
they believed Id manage well
Friends I learned about the 8020 Rule later
and started applying it in my life
This rule basically says that
you do not need to be 100 perfect in everything
Instead put in the bare minimum efforts to be 80 perfect
and for many things in life that will be enough
Obviously if you aim at being a topper
you need to be 100 perfect at your studies
But this strategy can be used in all aspects of life
I talked about this in detail in my course on Time Management
If you havent enrolled for the course
I recommend that you try it out
if you are a student or work at a 95 job
you can learn how you can maximise your time
I learned this from my experience
How am I able to manage the channels and travel all at once?
I talk about all of it in this course
I tell you practically
how you can use these techniques in your life
and improve yourself
The link to this course is in the description below
Honestly those who have taken this course
say that it has been lifechanging for them
The first 500 people to buy this course

Go join it ASAP
Getting back to my story
youd be wondering what I chose after the 12th
I wanted to have all my options open
I took the admission tests for various colleges
Such as Manipal University IIT JEE
Back then the two IIT and JEE were separate exams
But unfortunately none of the ranks was so good
that I could secure admission
So yeah the 8020 philosophy isnt a good idea
if you want to be a topper and secure admission to IIT
Apart from these engineering exams
I sat for the NDA exam too
Actually to be honest joining Indian Air Force or the Indian Army
was my first choice  instead of these engineering colleges
There were 2 main reasons for this
First when I think about office jobs
it seems astoundingly boring to me
A job with the Army is more physically challenging and adventurous
Second as I told you before
several relatives were in the Army
So I made sure to study really well for this exam
because it was important to pass that
Friends there are 2 stages in the selection process of NDA
First is the written test
And the second is the SSB interview
After passing the written test I was called to Varanasi for the interview
I was very confident when I went to Varanasi
because there are 2 stages in the interview stage
One of which was the physical test
I was confident that I would easily pass the physical test
because I considered myself to be very fit
And then was the actual interview
Friends this was perhaps the most ironic event in my life
In the interview process candidates are given a topic
and they are asked to discuss and debate it
A group of 1012 students are formed
And the group is given a topic to debate on
I was a part of such a group
And when it was our turn they gave us a topic
And we were asked to start our debate
Before I could even think about it
some people started to debate it passionately
I looked to one and the others
and could get in only a few sentences
about what I agreed with and what I disagreed with
And within moments the debate ended
Back then I wasnt good at putting my point across
I talked slowly
And in this interview they were looking for people
who could talk straightforwardly loudly and clearly
With a powerful voice
And do you know how my speaking style was?
Like this
Integrated within the gearbox
And now as a beltdriven system
for more flexibility
and shockhandling capability
Obviously I failed this interview
and then we began planning for what we could do next
Which college we could choose
Then my parents began looking at colleges outside of India
because they believed that better than
getting admission to any Cgrade engineering college in India
was studying abroad
And then we chose Germany
Youd ask why Germany
It was simple
The other Englishspeaking developed countries
such as the USA the UK Australia Canada
have high tuition fees
Studying there wouldve been very expensive
On the other hand in Germany and other European countries
studying is almost free
because therere no tuition fees
Especially if you study in their local languages
Obviously there would still be living expenses
The living costs are quite expensive
For that my parents took out an education loan
The applications were sent to several colleges and universities
And the acceptance came from 2 places
First was the Eindhoven University in the Netherlands
And the second was Germanys Karlsruhe Institute of Technology
We saw that they were among the well respected and highranking universities in the world
How did I secure admission without being a topper?
All I can say about this is that
perhaps it was luck to a large extent
because back then in 2012 not many people went abroad to study
and the number of foreigners applying to these universities wasnt large
So there wasnt a lot of competition
The other reason that might have played a role in it was perhaps
that the foreign universities dont focus much on marks
They focus on other skills hobbies and experiences
Perhaps when I showed my interest in Lego robots
and mentioned it on the application
that might have played a role
Because the course I applied for was
In August 2012 at 17 years old
I moved from India to Germany
Here if you ask me why I chose Mechanical Engineering
one of the reasons was that
the interest in robotics and technology that I had since early childhood
but the second but bigger reason was that
at 17 years which child knows what they should do?
Most of my friends and classmates were choosing engineering
and back then it was often said that
if you dont know what you should do
you should do engineering and then decide what you really want to do
So even though I wasnt 100 sure
about what I wanted to do
engineering seemed like a good option
so I chose to do that
Later I found it quite interesting
And I completed the Bachelors course in 2015
after which I did my Masters in Renewable Engineering
from the same university at Karlsruhe
This university Karlsruhe Institute of Technology
I made a vlog on the university tour
In case you havent watched it the link to it is in the description below
Interestingly in 2014
during an internship
I move out of the University
for an internship at the office of a company
It was a bit away from the main city
About a 1hour trip daily by tram
On this tram I met a girl Juli
We took the same tram every day
Juli would be on her to her school and Id be going for the internship
Exactly 75 years after this
we got married
2014 was the year when I uploaded my first video on YouTube
This happened a few months after meeting Juli
This was the time when my fascination with YouTube began
I discovered the existence of such a platform
I was interested in making videos since my childhood
so I started using this platform
And eventually began uploading videos regularly
We crossed the 50000 subscriber mark in 2017
but my parents didnt think that it could be a career option
On top of it I believed that even if it did become a career option
perhaps this wouldnt generate a respectable amount of income
So I decided to continue with my studies
And then in 2018
I got my Masters degree
And another Bachelors
on Economics and Business Management
But this was purely out of interest
So that I could make better videos
So that I could do this better
After 201718 I put YouTube as the 1 priority
and kept education on 2
Because this was my passion
I started believing that this was possible
That I could definitely do something that was never done before
And that was it friends
When one is passionate about something
when you truly enjoy doing something
It is easy to bring consistency and discipline into it
I wont say that its entirely easy
you still need to put in your efforts and hard work
But to a large extent it is comparatively easier
Remember that dialogue in 3 Idiots?
You should study to be capable not successful
A great man once said
Study not to be successful but to be capable
Dont chase success
Excellence chase excellence
And success will follow you
Remember this
I never focused on reaching a certain number of subscribers
Throughout my YouTube career I focused on
how I could keep improving myself
On how I could improve the quality of the videos I produce
And how I could better deliver my message to you
I simply hope that you keep enjoying future videos
If you want to ask me anything
you can ask your questions in the comment section
Since this is a special video I will try to answer as many questions as I can
And Ill see you in the next video
Thank you very much!
