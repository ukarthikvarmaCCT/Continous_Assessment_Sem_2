This is a video of the best workers on the planet
The best
Like this guy who can make a whopper in under one second
or this person who can do the job of a hundred people
Thats crazy we should hire him
All right so we have a bus boy cleaning a table bro
This dudes cleaning at like his lifes on the line
Hes sonic and he is speed
For some reason this reminds me of like
a battle in Naruto
I wanna go there and order a hundred pancakes
but each on a different plate
So then he has to pick up all of them
I wanna see a God in action
Oh this is the type of stuff I like
This is working smarter not harder
No way is this how you actually do it?
This is how you break things if you want to
But this guy got lucky
That is probably the coolest thing Ive ever seen
I wonder if it costs less to hire him
because he doesnt need a real truck
It probably calls more to insure him
because theres a good chance hes gonna break something
Bro is moving
Oh my goodness
Oh its firefighter truck
Oh snap
We assume hes a firefighter
He could just be a guy who really likes climbing ladders
All right
This is the fastest Whopper ever made
Ill be the judge of that
Actually that person with the clock
will be the judge of that
Look at him his positioning his face
That is intense focus
Were about to witness history
Oh ketchup fell over part of his plan
See now its ready
Oh my God it was ready for the squirt
I would say Im impressed but Burger King sucks
Go order Beast Burger its 30 times better
Burger Kings do Beast Burger better

Hes just popping off
If I saw that I would just walk up to him
and give him a 50 bill
Yeah I have a strong urge to give him tons of money
I wonder whats gonna happen
Oh wait thats not what I thought would happen
I thought they were about to pop off
This man knows physics geometry and math
Hes unstoppable
You know whats more impressive
than that guy whos clearly forklift certified?
This rectangular ice cream cone
