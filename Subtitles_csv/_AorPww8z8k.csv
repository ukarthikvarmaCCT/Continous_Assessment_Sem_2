How much can you make a business with Layers?
We can make millions
As a creator there are many ways to earn money
We should know what we shouldnt do
I think that technology is coming
I dont want to tell you
Please cut this part
Am I fake?
Am I pretending?
Today we have a creator with us
Who you know for technology
But I think of him as a good businessman
Normally we hear that to make a business
We should have an idea
Then we make a business and do marketing
But he has reversed this wheel
First he created a distribution
Then he is making a business
And I think he is making a business in a very smart way
In some places I am having a problem
I think I should ask questions
So we will ask questions
Lets know about him
Hello friends I am Shlok Srivastav
We are making tech videos
We have been making videos for 10 years
And along with that
I have a passion
In every person
I also have a passion for design and aesthetics
I always wanted to make something
In which I can put my love
If it reaches the audience through physical products
It will be great
So we have built a clothing brand
And a mobile accessories brand
Apart from that
We have executed a lot of social media and marketing
In the last 67 years
It has been an insightful and interesting journey
We have done a lot of big launches
The next few years are definitely going to be very strong
I dont know how to praise myself
You are doing very well
Tell me
When you started the YouTube channel
Did you decide to launch a product?
Or was it a journey as a creator?
While doing it
When you got the audience
Did you think of selling something?
As a creator
There are a lot of ways to earn money
Because you have a lot of things
You can do marketing for a company
Like there are so many companies
You can help them in marketing
We have also built applications
We have built different things
And I have noticed that
There is a different game everywhere
Making a product is a different game
Our main goal was to inspire
Because I saw a problem
In India
There is no shortage of resources
Its not like we make so much food
That we feed the whole population 3 times
So I faced a problem with the mindset
So my goal was
To make something different
Something strong
Something that creates a movement
And we tried that
With layers
That product was not successful before
And that product was not in the market
No one knew what skins were
There were few people who knew
But apart from that we created the market
So when that emotion
Gets attached to a project
I think it propels it
Same with clothes
I saw that all the clothes in India
Are being sold by international brands
And Indian brands are selling it cheap
Some are selling it for 200 rupees
Some are selling it for 500 rupees
We are cutting the price
No one is making such expensive clothes
So we tried to solve that problem
It took us a long time to solve that problem
It took us 3 years to make clothes
To make such clothes
That are dealing with international brands
It took us 3 years to make the same skins
To install the factory
To set up the manufacturing
To see the operations
The technologies that are used for that
I think
We have to make money
Business can run only with money
If there is no money
Then what is business
I dont believe in that
I think if we want to make something big
Internationally We need money
But the goal was to create a movement
I think we have done that
To some extent
But now the goal is
To take the Indian brand
To an international level
I have thought about it
If you count on your hands
Like we were asking you
There are so many brands that are selling Indian brands
We cant count on our fingers
We dont even know the brands that are selling outside India
And there are very few brands
So I think someone has to break the barrier
Someone has to make international business from India
So we
Go into that risky area
And do things
Now its a stove
So one thing I wanted to ask
Which is honest
You have worked on your personal branding
Because I think
I have seen this constantly
I am from a marketing background
So I notice small things
What I noticed
When we talked
There was a fire in the message
Some of your keywords
Like we were talking normally
We were talking like this
And when we make videos
We talk like this
We will do this
Did this happen naturally
Or did it take time
Because if I watch old English videos
At that time
Body language
And as we are transitioning to recent
There is a difference in our body language
We have changed a lot to make a relation with our audience
This is honest
Yes 100
Like a person
I have thought a lot about this
Am I pretending
And what happens is
I have seen myself
Like every person has a different style
When he is going to meet girls
He becomes sweet
When he is going to meet his brothers
He has a different vibe
Like this
Same person
If he is talking to kids
He becomes sweet
And if he is talking to his friends
He becomes sad
So I saw that
I used to try to talk sophisticated
Professionally In my college
Then I thought
My friends are coming
After that
I felt uncomfortable in English
Because our mindset is like this
When do we speak English
We have to speak formally
It becomes a habit
Hindi becomes a comfort
So I imagined
My friends are sitting behind
I am talking to them
Like when we were talking before
I was a business owner
To a business owner
But now I know
Many young entrepreneurs are watching this
So I want
They should also
Feel the same
Thats why I change a little
So who is your audience
If you imagine
What is their age
Where do they live
Where are they studying
So I imagined my audience
When I started
I imagined my age
Because they are the same type
Who are doing everything
So I imagined
In the beginning
Guys who are interested in tech
Because usually 5 of the guys are interested in tech
This is the start of YouTube
Majorly 16 to 24 years old guys
Who are studying engineering
Those who are studying coding
Engineering That is my audience
Engineers are interested in technology
They attract them
If you see anything
They get attracted
So I took my audience
And I was not deciding
Now it is different
You will be able to notice
My way of speaking changes
The way of speaking changes
The way of showing things visually changes
On Instagram
There are a lot of girls on Instagram
There are a lot of people on Instagram
Who follow for fashion
There is a different vibe on Instagram
The audience is very different
People on YouTube know about tech
Let me give you an example
Recently I go out less
I went to the bank
I had to do KYC
I have to go there
I had to change my account
I saw a girl
She said hi
I watch your videos
Age Reversal
I uploaded this video 2 years ago
I was confused
She said
I asked where did you see
She said
By chance we cut the clip
And uploaded it on Facebook
She did not know about our long form video
She did not know about tech
She knew that we upload short clips
She just saw our video on Facebook
You will not believe
In our audience
There are only a few Indian cities
There are cities of Bangladesh
There are a few cities outside India
There are a few cities of US
There are a few cities of Canada
I did not know
Every platform
There is a different audience
And now it has become so different
That everyone has to treat it differently
So there is a different type of content for everyone
Yes 100
We are not able to optimize for everyone
I try to make content that
Can cater to everyone
Now what happened?
You grew your channel
It became a base
People were knowing
Your demographic was clear
A 1624 year old kid
You made a product around his needs
The first product was Layers
I am also a Layers
Your audience
I will tell you
When I was doing engineering
I had a Micromax
A116 Micromax was not a good brand
I did not like Micromax
I used skin
Just to hide the Micromesh
At that time all the phones looked the same
The phones were sold on screen size
Today there is a lot of trend
At that time screen size was a big issue
It was a big phone
Micromesh canvas
If I had put a skin on the back my Micromesh would have
been hidden
So my target
If I think why I used the skin
To hide the Micromesh
If we talk about today
The phones become prominent
So according to me most people
Dont use the skin
If I try to think demographically
Then you tell me
Because I want to know your point of view
I am trying to think
Who buys
One people
Who like to keep their phones naked
Without cases
And they want scratches on their phones
Second people
Who want to show their phones as a trend
Because now a days most of the phones come in white plain
They want something
Or They want to express their emotions
There is one audience
Who wants to show
I am like this
So basically they are expressing their emotions
If I say third audience
I will say
They are resembling a community
If I talk about my brother
My brother
Brought a roll from Gafar market
He has
A 3D printer
He has a CNC printer
So now a days
Models are available online
Of every phone case
So he goes to buy a new phone
He gets the exact same sheet
Printed and put it on his phone
So whenever his phone changes
And he changes his phone a lot
Every 3 months
His back will always be the same
Technology will change camera will change
But the look and feel of the phone
Will always be the same
I use my phone
So that I always remember
If someone keeps their phone aside
I always remember my phone
That is his mindset
So I am able to think of these 3 people
You tell me what you thought
When I started
I was not able to define
It was a mistake
And I was not able to define it
Because at that time
It was not a must to adopt it
After this product
The audience we wanted to sell
I wanted to sell
It was not well known
There were very few skin men
Delhi Mumbai
Nehru Place Gafar
You used to get skin in Gafar
And they used to cut it off with a blade
They used to cut it off
With a blade
They used to scratch it
They used to scratch it
The problem was
It did not glow
I felt that the quality of the skin
Was not that good
And the design was not that good
So we worked hard
To add texture
And no one was able to copy it
Because the set up was worth crores
If I break down the layers of the business
We removed the need
That this is not a need driven business
There is no need for this product in the market
It is not that
No one wants skin
It is a humanity driven
Or emotional purchase
Who wants to purchase it?
It makes me feel good
I love the design and texture
It is not that
It saves from scratches
It provides protection
But the primary reason
Is that you feel
That you are a part of a community
That is the primary
Need of
Belonging I feel good
Like college students
Represent themselves
For example
We wear clothes
Like Gucci
Or I wear a watch
It is not that
It solves a functional purpose
Like logo or watch
It is the same watch
It tells me the time
It is not a functional product
It is an emotional purchase
In my opinion
Emotional purchase is a good thing
Because people say
Dont spend money
Why not?
Everything is so
Emotionally driven
Let me give you an example 22 boys
Are hitting the ball with a stick
And a country of 1 billion
Is watching them
Everyone is happy
Everyone is shouting
The whole country is sad
That they couldnt hit with a stick
There is no purpose
There is no logic
Everything is emotional
If we break down
What is logical 90 of the things we do
Are emotionally driven
In India
There is no lack of resources
There is a lack of mindset
The same mindset
And the same
If you go to India
To meet rich people
I go to clubs
Do you know what kind of people
I meet?
I make henna oil
I make a tyre cover
I make a machine
To clean the road
I make the threads
And what will happen?
Profit will be 800 crores
Profit will be 600 crores
In India the same business
But I think
From today
The time of internet
From now
Vanity and emotional businesses
Will be successful
I think
Distribution was created
If we talk about a normal brand
They also have to sell their skin
Because everyone has money
A person can install a machine
Can bring the same technology
Distribution can also come in India
Distribution will be on every sale
Today I researched 6070 traffic
Is coming on your website
Because of Shlok
Shlok has generated a lot of business
But today
If a new brand comes
They have to make their own brand
Maybe they run a ppc campaign
When someone searches skin
Or layer
They have to take a lot of tension
In which
Where you can earn a good margin
By selling a skin for 500
The other person
Cant earn even by selling a skin for 800
Because he has to spend a lot of money
Maybe the business doesnt work
Because people follow Shlok
People trust Shlok
People say that I dont care about 100150
If I have to put a skin I will put a good one
I dont want to take a loss
Let me tell you two things
Our mode
Our factory
Because we have increased the entry barrier
If you want to compete with us
You need factory setup
You need machines latest technology
You need printing
The 3M paper
We source it from a different country
Our product is the best in India
It is best because
We have spent money
Entry barrier is of money
No one can make it better than us
No one
The other thing is
Distribution We have worked hard for it
It is like saying
You are coming to play basketball
You are tall 100 advantage
But I will use that advantage
If I have any advantage of distribution
I will reach my audience 100
And I feel
Even empty distribution doesnt work
Let me give you an example
Logan Paul and Mr
They are very popular in the US
Logan Paul has 2 million views
In the last video 23 million views
Mr Beast has 150200 million 300 million
Distribution is worldwide 150200 million
Only in US
In Hindi 1020 million
Mr Beast has more than 100 distribution
But Prime
It is a 7 billion dollar business
And Mr
Beasts fee stable
Is not that good
So I feel
Distribution alone doesnt work
Product should be good
I feel
Product should be good
If product is not good then nothing
Product should be better than market
But I feel
There is a way to spread message
It makes a difference
People get to know
You are making something good
You are telling the truth
If you work hard people will buy
It is easy to reach people
It is not that difficult to buy distribution
But it takes money
Most of the companies are in loss
If you promote in shorts
You will get 4050 million views
Conversion Conversion is not coming
Distribution is there
Conversion is not coming
Conversion is emotionally driven
When an influencer is connected
With a product
You wont be able to buy it
Even if you give 10 lakh rupees
You will get 40 million views
People will see
But people know it is an ad
When an influencer is involved in a product
Or the owner
Like I made distribution
I was famous
And I built things
Over a period of time
Now the company is doing the opposite
They knew they were figuring out a product
They made their marketing
They knew what to make
Now the owner is coming
To make a video
We also saw what the situation is and the owners
themselves are making it so I think those days have gone
that you just sit down and buy the distribution give 1020
lakhs spend crores the distribution will come the work
will be done those days
have gone because now people are used to sitting idle the
owner himself will have to come and sell or if he doesnt
come he will have to learn social media how content is
made how peoples minds have to reach them that is very
important to me
It is a big fight for everyone and if you are doing your
business then if possible then instead of paid
distribution focus on building a community make your own
social media where people trust you not for your product
but whatever you are delivering
now try to gather a community together so that in the
future when you subconsciously integrate your product it
keeps on selling
People will say lets talk about Elon Musk for example we
have been seeing him working a lot in the personal brand
100 at this time the value of words is very high and
the value of connect is very high so I think it will be a
major part
This is a hard question because our audience enjoys this
discussion How much business is being made from layers?
Approximately if we talk about the revenue point of view
If I tell you honestly our revenue is around crores but
because there are a lot of investments like I told you we
have invested in a design agency
In that our entire design agency will change that is the
new products we are building we have a design agency
outside India a UK design agency which basically designs
Together we are designing a product which we will launch
in AprilMay because it takes 8 months to make a
differentiated product So all the money we are getting
it is getting invested in new product development
So if you look at the actual profit on paper then our
profit will be almost 0 and we will be in loss because
more money is being invested in the next project So from
the revenue point of view we are doing decent because if
I tell you honestly
we would have to go international
In India it is a luxury purchase Skin is a very luxury
purchase and the market ahead of it is outside India And
after this I dont want to buy a small mobile accessory I
want to take a big jump in the consumer electronics space
I am not selling a TV I am not selling a speaker but I am
selling a watch When it will launch you will know
Everyone has said no everyone has said yes that is if
nothing is said on one then it is the same Lets go ahead
It can be a watch like this or it can be a mobile or it
can be a spaceship
What do you say? We are selling cars to go to Mars
Like I have a franchise business of Chole Bhature on the
Its been 8 years we are selling franchises
So I understood but is the revenue fluctuating? Is it
Revenue is constantly increasing I think when we started
it was increasing quite well Because we are not just
Techburner we have done marketing in many other things
besides Techburner
When I searched Google ads were running Ads are running
then we work with other influencers and do multiple things
And the community that buys continues to reach them
Launches keep happening so even old customers keep buying
I think one major reason for a business to be successful
like overlays and layers is that our customers buy again
We dont have onetime buyers
The person who buys from us once that is a lifetime waste
Normally what is the cycle? How many months does a person
change their skin on average?
In 6 months a person usually changes their skin There are
many people who change their skin in 34 months And there
are many people who like to change their skin Usually the
female customers I have seen their frequency is more to
change their skin
But our audience is dominantly male
Are you focusing more on Instagram? No I am not focusing
on Instagram to attract girls We dont have a major focus
on Instagram It is more on the lines that earlier the
fashion style that I used to think of I never visually
output it
I used to think that people will find it weird that a tech
creator is wearing this kind of clothes Or why is he
engaging in fashion? So I used to get scared I talked to
a lot of people and asked them how to do it So I used to
think that I dont stop
myself And even this fear let me tell you I even have
business values
Earlier when I used to make YouTube videos people used to
find it weird that I suddenly started talking about
business Because they dont know that I have done so many
things in the past It is the same thing on Instagram Now
people are thinking that
I have become a fashion person suddenly But for 23 years
I have been involved in fashion I have done designs I
have designed clothes I have done a lot of things So it
was a constant work in progress But now people have
started to see it
I think my focus is that for some time I want to sell only
to boys I dont want to sell more to girls Because the
marketer knows that
Why didnt you sell skins and cases? Because lets see the
audience is the same The skin audience was small and the
same audience could have sold more cases
In cases what is the brand of case in India that sells
printed cases well which is very successful? You will not
be able to get it Usually the cases that will be there
will only be of iPhone It will not be that everyone will
be selling If there
will be then the iPhone will be selling
The reason is that the supply chain is very difficult
There are so many challenges in the supply chain that if
you want to sell a good quality case for Rs 300400 it is
a very difficult business
And you will not make a profit in that Because I tell you
the case companies that sell so many cases you have no
idea People have no idea that tons of cases are burned
This is a very wastage When I was entering I thought of a
case only But I realized that it was a good decision for
the environment and everything Plus the supply chain is
so difficult that if we enter we would have made a
business But in that
I didnt want to get into accessories for a long time
I liked the skin of the case And we wouldnt have been
able to add something like this to the case The supply
chain of the case is difficult for a normal person But if
you put on the whole manufacturing setup
When an order comes do we already have the skin ready? I
will tell you operationally that I am not so much into
operations We have hired heads who lead operations But
around 30 remains with us
And our supply chain is so fast that if we get an order
now we can ship it by the evening Everything is packed
and shipped by the evening But the problem is that we get
more orders
And how much capacity do we have now? How much can we make
daily? I will have to check Because now we have 3
machines I dont know exactly but we can easily do
20003000 But I will have to confirm
I will tell you honestly that I personally dont get into
operations Because I dont have the strength in
operations For that I have brought the right people who
know it well And I think as a business owner our biggest
skill is that we should know
what we dont want to do and what we dont know
I have made a mistake by doing all this And I have learned
this from experience that I should bring someone else for
what I dont know I am involved in design product
development and marketing I know how to build a product
what is going on in the
market what is the demand of people how to design what
screw will be used what will be the finish what texture
will come how to open in packaging what smell should come
I am deeply involved in this
And I am deeply involved in the marketing part
I think I will tell you honestly operations is a job that
anyone can do
There are people in the market who can do it
And why should I do such a job that people in the market
can already do?
But the product development and design is very unique to
us No one else can copy that in the market So thats why
I try to do the same thing that only I can do
So how did you switch overlays? After skin?
I am not switching both are working together
No I mean why did you think that I do this too? We have
more alternatives to do
But why did you choose jackets? Did you feel that this
business is not being made a good business can be made in
a jacket?
No no nothing like that Layers are running well Layers
are running well Layers are growing
But lets see tan wise if we talk about making a bigger
business then we can make a bigger business in the
clothing line versus skin I will start with this point
Yes 100
So did you start clothing thinking this?
because we had to do it first
Ill tell you honestly we started with overlays before
layers I mean actually in the beginning we started with
overlays first We started with layers later
And in overlays what happened was at that time the entry
barrier as I told you the entry barrier was huge
If you want to make highquality clothes if you want to
make basic clothes 100 cotton Tshirts with a little bit
of print
You can make it anyone can make it
There are so many factories
But if you want to make clothes that beat international
brands there are only a few factories in India that can
make it for you
They have the machines
They have the things that will provide you quality at that
That was a big problem to solve
We have to beat them
But we dont even have that much money that how do you work
in such a big factory?
They take lakhs of orders
Now we dont even have the budget for lakhs of orders
It wasnt there at that time
We were just starting at that time
Then what did we do?
We decided how to do it
We wont sell less quality
We cant start selling less quality
We decided to make our own factory
We do everything
We have been running this factory for 225 years
We had bought a factory before this
It was 225 years old
We were making it
We were improving in every launch
Then we bought a big factory
And when we felt that our quality has been set
This is going to beat any international brand
We are selling at a price where no international brand can
Then we presented it well to the market
Till then we didnt do any marketing
Till then we did a little marketing in launches
But it reached the masses when we actually made a product
which people knew that we made it
And it is of good quality
And we are selling it at the right price
So thats why people saw it
But actually this thing has been going on for 335 years
And even now what happens is when we make more videos
people think that we have shifted the business
Its not like that
Majorly both things are growing together continuously
And we keep shifting it month by month
That this month is its launch
This month is its launch like this
So it will run continuously
But yes as you said
Kinzs market has an upper cap in India
To expand its cap now as I tell you layers you think its
promotion is not going on
But its promotion is going on outside India
We are figuring out how to do it outside India
So we are growing it more outside India
And we are figuring out things outside India
We dont even know about overlays in India
So in India we are doing it
So what is everyones strategy in doing things like this?
See how technical it is
I feel that many people understand Shlok
Thats why I wanted to do it with you
I have been connecting with you for a long time
Because most people understand Shlok as a YouTuber
They think he will set fire
And no one knows how smart he is sitting behind
Who has thought a lot strategically
When are the watches coming? I dont want to tell you about
the watches yet
You will know whether we will do the watches or not
What will be the price segment? Will it be affordable or
super premium? We are figuring it out
We are working very hard right now
I want to say this
And I can only tell you that we are working with the best
companies in the world
And we are giving a lot of time to the product we are
Usually the watch market there are many people who I know
Even just in general the consumer electronics market is
very quick
People dont know
The goods come from outside India
Same to same it is sold in India
By putting a brand
And we are optimizing a little bit here and there
But no one is working on the design the whole experience
the software end to end
I am feeling that way
And I feel that watches can replace smartphones
It has become so powerful
Because now a lot of things are coming in that space
So what we will take out will be expensive
Sustainability is my requirement
I wont tell you the price
I have a requirement in the watch
Put that in
Then I will start another new startup
I have decided on my own
Put a glucometer in the watch
In China many people are doing 8090
Because lets talk about CJM
You have also come to fitness
So you have started understanding biomechanics
So the CJM that has come nowadays
Many companies are selling it
It is 8090 accurate
So I was doing some research
There are some watches coming in China
It looks like a needle
It is doing it without a needle
It is doing it with sweat
And it is doing it in the watch
Many companies have made it in China
And it is also doing OEM for others
If it is 8090 accurate just imagine
I mean I am telling you
If the audience will understand then fine
If not then do it further
Normally I wear a watch
My walk is being monitored
If I give it my data my fat my height etc
Then it might be able to monitor my calories too
Now it is able to monitor my heart rate too
Now if it starts monitoring my glucose level too
Then what will happen?
As soon as I eat it will ask me Have you eaten anything?
Because it saw that my spike has come
I will say yes
Now it will ask what have you eaten?
I will tell it a little
Based on that it will calculate its calories
Now it will tell me
It will get to know after some time
Because AI is coming here
It will get to know from time
How do my fat burn go to my body? When I wore CGM I took a
one month trial
I mean I wore it for a month
So I got to know that fat burns are well absorbed on my
Normally it is bad for people
But it is not so bad for me
My body behaves well with fat burns
Similarly if I wear a watch then this data will start
If someone is under stress
Then how are fat burns affecting his body?
Just imagine how big a data set can be made
I mean my idea is
Because I dont want to get into hardware
I am a marketer a software guy
So I dont want to get into hardware
If someone makes it
I mean I have investors ready
That we will make such a product
Which is end to end
What is happening logically?
We are going to the doctor
There are many types of practical apps made these days
We are going to the doctor
After that we have shared all the data of my watch
So he is getting to know
At what time did my glucose fluctuate?
At what time did my heart rate fluctuate?
What is my resting heart rate?
What is my walking heart rate?
Based on that he has done my full analysis
Now if my watch feels
That if someones resting goes so much
And he is eating this type of food
And this is happening because of it
So maybe his cholesterol can be high
So by default my app will tell me
Get a cholesterol test done
I did it
We filled the data
My one more data was added to my watch
He got one more learning
At this much cholesterol this persons heart rate remains
this much
And the food is absorbed like this
I mean there can be a fire in this thing
I mean what we call smart watch revolution
I think this can be a fitness band revolution
If anyone is watching tell me
I mean I am saying if you want to go ahead go ahead
I think it is 100
Because I have also tried those CGN monitors
And it is very good and useful
Even I am very much involved in health
That I have taken so many things in health
Now for example I did a mattress by sleeping on it
I also found that very interesting
I mean it is hot and cold
There are so many things
I am also taking a lot of supplements
I am figuring out a lot of things
And in the watch I feel like The problem I am seeing
If I tell you honestly
I see this problem
This is definitely a good feature
According to me the basics are not being done right now
I think the first thing should be
A standard good user interface
And all the things that are working accurately
So our focus is very different right now
Because we are not using all these features in this segment
We will not use it in the Apple segment
So according to me
The demand of the current user The price point at which we
want to go
We want to meet it very well
And if we make a fitness product
Then I will not make it in 3 months
I will make it in 3 years
And I will make such a product That after wearing that band
You dont have to do anything else
Because I dont believe in halfhearted things
That you are getting a sensor
Lets put it on and do it
There were a lot of things like this
We also made a smart ring prototype
We figured out how it happens in smart rings
All the watches were in smart rings
After that we tried different prototypes
And I can tell you that
Like you are telling one sensor
There are blind sensors
There are 10 things in the market
But I
I focus on the experience and go to work
And according to me
If I am aiming for a category Then I have to be number one
in it
If I am entering the Apple race
Then my goal would not be that
Apple takes this much market
It sells for 30000 rupees
Takes this much market
I take out 25000
Put one or two extra features in a little less feature
I dont go from that perspective
If I am entering a market Then I will make sure that
We make the best product in that market
Our product should be the best in the world
And then we sell it at a premium
That is my philosophy
If I cant beat Apple
Then I wont enter the Apple race
I will enter the product in 34 years
Where I have done a lot of research with health experts
Then I will go there and eat this
You dont even have to tell
The watch will tell you
Eat this in the morning
You will be healthy
So health is a priority
I will definitely do something in health in the next few
But for me
Because people have no idea
Because what happens now
I will tell you the biggest problem
We all are sick
We dont know
All the people in Delhi are sick
Everyone has no idea that they are sick
The thing that you cant measure
You dont know how sick you are
You have been sick since childhood
So you dont know that you are sick
You dont know what being healthy is
The thing that people cant measure
If I tell you Ill tell you a number if you are this much
sick and you can be this much healthier then you will
improve a lot
So I also feel that we take health for granted we dont
even know what is healthy
And if you go to the side of Japan Okinawa and all these
blue zones there are areas all over the world there
people live 100 years comfortably and they dont live 100
years they are trekking at the age of 90 they have abs at
the age of 70 naturally
good strong physique at the age of 70 their diet and
everything is good lifestyle diet a lot of things are
good so essentially you live 3 lives in one life I see it
like that too so I think that technology is coming it
will come slowly but it will
be very interesting the watch will also play a part in it
especially wearables will play a big part in it
I have a lot of watches but since I bought this I have
been wearing this only everything gets tracked somewhere
the phone also comes here a lot of other things come here
so I feel that wearable is next level thing it excites me
a lot and all the
best then I have told you this is smart questioning now
say it like this stop it we will tell you in the intro
Please cut this part it is not good
Thank you I got to learn a lot personally and I think the
audience also got to learn a lot
100 I also had a lot of fun talking to you knowing
everything even the conversation before the camera I
found it very interesting and I hope the things you are
doing the users the consumers they also got some help
but yes definitely a lot of
Thank you so much for coming thank you
