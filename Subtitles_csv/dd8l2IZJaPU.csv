Hello friends!
Farmers are protesting on the streets once again
and this time their biggest demand
is MSP
The legalisation of Minimum Support Price
Minimum Support Price
MSP for all crops
Many news anchors and YouTubers claim that
if the government fulfils this demand
then it will completely destroy the countrys economy
It will cost more than 10 Trillion!
What is the truth behind this?
Is the demand of farmers right or wrong?
Lets understand the reality of the farming industry
in todays video
MRP or Maximum Retail Price
is the maximum price at which  things can be sold in the market
MRP exists to protect consumers  and the general public in the country
So that no company or shopkeeper can exploit us
If there was no MRP
you can imagine how terribly  people would have been exploited
If you were in the desert and facing water shortages
someone could try to sell a bottle of water for 2000
If there was a cooking oil shortage in your city
you could be forced to buy cooking oil for 1000 per litre
Now in contrast to MRP the opposite is MSP
that is Minimum Support Price
The minimum amount that would be  paid to the farmers for their crops
The reason remains the same
So that companies and middlemen cant exploit them
Even if the buyers set up a mafia
the farmer shouldnt be forced to sell  onions for 2 and garlic for 050
They should have a guarantee of a minimum price
Like MRP MSP is also very logical
thats why most politicians have always favoured it
Like BJP leader Narendra Modi before 2014
Listen to what he said
Minimum Support Price
is a headache for every farmer
But for the government
it has become a great way  to force their will
In one state the minimum support  price for wheat will be something
in the next state it will be another
In one place the rate of rice will be something
in another place it will be something else
But everywhere the buyer is the Indian government
But the farmers dont get the right price
The policy of deciding the price  has not been implemented
How well Narendra Modi explained this problem!
A big round of applause for him
And not only the problem
he gives us the solution too
Listen further
Brothers and sisters
we have stated in our manifesto
that we will decide the MSP  based on rules and regulations
That is why we have said that  the cost of input for the farmer
water labour electricity  seeds fertilisers medicines
whatever the cost is
50 profit will be added to that cost
And that will be the MSP theyll have to sell at
In India MSP is issued by CACP
the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices
It is a decentralised agency
which was established in 1965
And today it functions under the Ministry  of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare
But the question is how should the MSP be decided?
How much should the MSP be?
In 2002 a committee was formed
the High Level Committee on Long Term Grain Policy
headed by economist Abhijit Sen
This committee said that MSP should be
based on C2 cost of production
But what does this mean?
To understand C2 we need to  understand A2 and FL costs first
First comes A2 cost
This is the cost that farmers have to pay
as direct expenses
Farmers buy seeds fertilisers pesticides  hire labourers to work in their fields fuel cost
these are the A2 costs
After this comes the FL cost
FLs full form is Family Labour
This cost is an estimated value
of unpaid family labour
When a farmer works in his field
often his family members help him in farming
Because his family members invest their time to help him
there should be a labour cost for them too
They could have used this time to do some other job
They missed the opportunity of getting a job
This is known as Opportunity Cost in economics
So these were the A2 and FL costs
Today CACP takes A2  FL cost to decide MSP
and multiplies it by 15
This is how MSP is decided today
But Abhijit Sens committee said that
we need to consider the C2 cost
C2 refers to the Comprehensive Cost
In C2 cost not only do we take the A2 and FL costs
but we consider the cost of Owned Capital  and the Rental Value of Land
You can understand this better with an example
Think of a photographer who has his own studio
To carry on his business
not only does he have to  spend money to take photos
and to print photos
but also to buy a camera
and even to pay rent the rent for the studio
Like a photographers studio
a farmers land has a rental value
If the farmer owns the land
then it is his capital
And if he doesnt own it
then he pays rent on it
Apart from this like the photographers  camera and studio lights
a farmer has to buy a tractor and a cultivator
The farmer doesnt buy a tractor just for fun
A tractor is bought to be used for agriculture
So shouldnt that cost be taken into account too?
All these are called Owned Capital Assets
And Abhijeet Sens commission report stated that
in C2 cost we should include  the A2 cost FL cost and this extra cost
And then make it the new basis for MSP
Friends after this a Swaminathan report was released
In 2004 MS Swaminathan
was heading the National Commission on Farmers
You might have heard of him already
he was one of the architects of the Green Revolution
Between 2004 and 2006
the Swaminathan Commission released 5 reports
In total these reports spanned almost 2000 pages
On the 246th page of the 5th report it is written that
the MSP should be at least 50 more than  the Weighted Average Cost of Production
Now some people get confused that
whether the Swaminathan Commission  was talking about C2 cost or A2FL cost
But if we read the entire report
there is no confusion
Between pages 74 to 84
theres a detailed discussion on
how in most of the states
MSP does not even recover the C2 cost
And if this C2 cost is not recovered
then farmers will stop farming  those crops in the long term
This 278page report
is available on the Ministry of Agricultures website
If you want to read it  the link is in the description below
Economics Professor R Ramakumar says that
when MS Swaminathan presented this  report to the Union Agriculture Minister
the 22nd slide of that presentation clearly mentioned that
MSP would be calculated at  C2 cost plus 50
On 28th September 2017  MS Swaminathan tweeted that
MSP should be at least C2  50
with procurement storage  and distribution costs included
He went one step further
He started talking about postharvest costs too
When farmers store their crops
they will incur storage costs too
we should take those into account
This was mentioned not only in this tweet
but also in the second report of  the Swaminathan Commission
On page 412 it was written that
The CACP should look into the aspects of risk factor
marketing and postharvest expenses
It might feel that he wants to pay  a lot of money to the farmers
That our countrys economy will crash
if we start paying farmers so much
But think about it
Doesnt every other business in the country
run like this?
All the costs incurred in running any business
are taken into account
Most companies account for their
office vehicles travel
TV trolley bags blazers
networking tea snacks pizza
everything as Company Expenses
So for farmers to take these four costs into account
whats wrong with that?
The input cost of seed fertilisers and water
the cost of their family labour
the cost of their capital assets
and finally the marketing and postharvest expenses
Swaminathan report mentioned two more interesting things
First MSP should not only be applied to the government
but also to private traders
Whoever is buying directly from the farmers
should buy at least at the MSP
And second MSP should be considered only as a bottom line
So that no one can buy produce cheaper than it
But when the government buys
they should buy it at the same price
as the private traders
If the market price increases
then the government should pay more
This report even said that
the income of the farmers
should be comparable to that of the civil servants
Imagine that
But anyhow theres no point in talking about it now
We will consider only the C2  50 cost
Now the question is
who will support the farmers to  get them the right price for their produce?
I want to free the farmers from  governments unfair practices
Narendra Modi!
Not only did he talk about farmers and MSP
he took an oath!
To improve Indias economic standing
we need to first improve the farmers economic standing
And to that extent
we the BJP are here to ask for your blessings
A big round of applause for him
Such a talent for putting his point across
Explained the problem in the first 2 minutes
and then gave a solution
And what he says next
will bring tears to your eyes
Lal Bahadur Shastri used to say
Jai Jawan Jai Kisan
He said the number of soldiers who died on the battlefield
more than that farmers have committed su!cide
They had to d!e a helpless deth
And thats why he addresses the crowd
if India has to change
then Indias villages have to change first
If India has to change
then Indias villages have to change first
To be honest friends  I dont have anything left to say
Narendra Modi talked about this in such a great way
But what happened after this video?
The people gave their blessings
In 2014 Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister
Two years later he made another big promise
By 2022 when India celebrates its 75th Independence Day
farmers income will be double
Now some people will say that
Modi could not do this because of COVID
Even though he did his best
But even if we ignore the two years of COVID
If not 2022 then it should have doubled by 2024
Instead of doubling the farmers income
instead of giving them the MSP at C2  50
what did the Modi government do?
They passed 3 black laws
The 3 Farm Laws
I had made videos on this before
when these laws were passed
In one video I showed you how
unconstitutionally they passed the bills in the Parliament
But the second problem was
these bills were actually favouring  the corporates over the farmers
Its not that before the laws were introduced
the farmers couldnt enter into  contract farming with the corporates
Obviously they could
But the provisions in those 3 Farm Laws
was basically like telling the corporates
that they could buy sell and set up markets arbitrarily
Government markets would be taxed
but there would be no taxes on private markets
What was an unfair practice before
corporates could now begin hoarding
raise the prices artificially
no reins on corporate actions
Almost in every aspect
large corporate companies were  given an advantage over the farmers
Last year in August a report was  published in the Reporters Collective
which revealed some interesting  facts about these farm laws
It was revealed that a man named Sharad Marathe
had written a letter to the then Vice  Chairperson of Niti Aayog Rajiv Kumar
They knew each other before
This letter talked about
the need to introduce marketdriven  agriculture business model in India
Look at Niti Aayogs office  memorandum from 16th October 2017
It talks about Sharad Marathes concept note
It was suggested that Niti Aayog  set up a task force for this
And guess what?
A task force was set up
Who was on that task force?
Sharad Marathe himself
Apart from this corporations like
Adani Group Patanjali Big Basket
Mahindra Group and ITC
but there were no farmers on this task force
In fact forget about any farmer
no farmer organisations or  economists were on this task force
The next report tells us how
Adani Groups companies wanted
the Essential Commodities Act to be repealed
Because this Act prohibited companies from hoarding
Why did Adani Group want to have this act repealed?
Perhaps this is connect to an old event
Pulse Scam from 2015
In April this year
the price of Arhar Dal pigeon pea  starts spiking all of a sudden
The dal which was available  in the market for less than 70
started costing more than 200
In 2015 the pulses reached 200 per Kg
The government carried out raids
6077 raids in total
More than 70000 tonnes of pulses were seized
which were being illegally hoarded
Who was benefiting from this?
Look at this report in Business Today
The Competition Commission of India raided
the offices of Glencore Export Trading Group and Edelweiss Group
When an income tax probe was conducted it was found that
Glencore Edelweiss and ETG were the major players
in this Pulse Price Rigging case
And finally look at this EPW report
Glencore had investments in
the ETC groups ETC Agro Processing India Private Limited
And Adani Group was connected to Glencore
through a joint venture
ChemOil Adani Private Limited
So its quite simple friends
When lentils were being sold for 200 per kg
the common man was suffering
The farmers were not benefiting
but some corporate companies  in the middle were benefiting
And what should the government  have done in such a case?
Should the antihoarding laws have been made stricter?
Or should it have been relaxed
to make it easier for companies to hoard?
Obviously they should have made it stricter
Instead the government introduced  these three farm laws
Some people tried to justify the farm laws by saying that
the Swaminathan report mentioned the  need to liberalise the agriculture sector
To bring in some market reforms
This is true
If you read the Swaminathan report
it is written on page 31 of the 5th report
that the role of State APMCs needs to be reviewed
We need to move towards a single Indian market
Even while bringing farm laws the government had said
One Nation One Market
But the problem lies in the details
Well the marketing terms
can be contorted in any manner
The devil is in the details
But the MSP mentioned in the Swaminathan report
the C2  50 formula
they were not included in the farm laws
Friends do you know the status  of MSP implementation today?
According to the Shanta Kumar Committee  appointed by the Central Government
only 6 of farmers get the benefit of MSP
Some other reports state that
6 is an underestimate
but lets believe Shanta Kumar
who is a BJP politician
and a former Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh
In 2020 he told The Print that
only the elite 6 of farmers get the benefit of MSP
and they are the ones opposing the farm laws
This is true to some extent
Most of the farmers who are protesting today
are from Haryana Punjab  and some are from Western UP
Why is this?
Think about it yourself
Farmers can be grouped into two
Something is being snatched away from one of the groups
The one that benefits from MSP now  but will soon lose the benefit
Will they protest?
Or the other group of farmers  who never benefited from MSP?
Take the example of Bihar
In 2006 Bihar abolished the APMC Act
What did the farmers of Bihar get from this?
This report tells us that between  200708 and 201617
in these 10 years
there was not a single season where
Bihars farmers could sell at a price higher than the MSP
The report of 2018 shows that farmers in Bihar
had to sell wheat at a price lower than MSP
A 2020 study shows that Punjabs farmers
get a 30 higher crop price
in comparison to Bihars farmers
only because of MSP
So the rest of the farmers who are not protesting
are in even worse situations
Ideally the remaining 94 of the farmers
should also be brought under provision of MSP
But what did the government try to do?
It tried to take away MSP from the few who were getting it
Thats why 3 years ago
the farmers protest was on a large scale
The protests went on for a year
Around 600700 people lost their lives in those protests
and after that those farm laws were thankfully repealed
But what about now?
Since the protests began again
it was for the original demand
for the promise made by Narendra Modi in 2014
MSPs legal guarantee
for farmers to get a fair price
If Narendra Modi demands MSP its alright
But if farmers demand it it somehow becomes wrong
There is a limit to hypocrisy
Look at this article from 20th February
The government has banned more  than 177 social media accounts
just because they were talking about farmers right
When these accounts were banned
Twitter came out with a public reply
That they banned the accounts  on the orders of the government
even though they acknowledged that  the governments actions were wrong
since it goes against freedom of expression
Kisan Ekta Morcha had 500000 followers
Its been banned for the last 2 years
It was banned during the last farmers protest
On Twitter many journalists and users say that
whenever they tweeted in favour of farmers
the government banned their accounts
And when in my videos I talk about
our country moving towards dictatorship
some people come at me to say that  the country is still a democracy
Tell me in which democracy have you heard of
people speaking in favour of farmers on social media
having their social media accounts banned on a mass scale?
I have not seen this happening in any democracy
But here I would like to give you a solution
To bypass the bans on these accounts
This can be done by using a VPN
You can download any VPN app on your phone
and with it you can spoof your location
Because the government can ban accounts only within India
not outside India
You can change the location of your phone through VPN
You can set the location to any place outside India
USA Canada Australia Europe anywhere
And you will be able to see the  blocked accounts even if you are in India
In my opinion NordVPN is one of the best VPN apps
It has more than 6000 servers
in 67 countries
The best advantage of this is that
no matter which country you go to
you can bypass any local restrictions in that country
The Chinese government does this a lot
In China apps like Facebook and YouTube are banned
But they can access these by using NordVPN
On top of it it also protects your online privacy
because it hides your IP address
And their latest feature is that
they provide a virtual server even in India
So people living outside India
can now spoof their location  pretending to be in India
Since NordVPN has sponsored this video
you will get a huge discount
plus 4 additional months for free
if you use my link
You can find the link in the description below
Its riskfree
Because of NordVPNs 30day moneyback guarantee
So you can try it by going to  NordVPNcomDhruv
Now lets get back to the topic
Today in North India
what is the economic viability of farming
lets understand it with a reallife example
In my family among my relatives  many are still engaged in farming
So the example I will show
is prepared with the information given by my uncle
I talked to him in detail and understood
the exact expenses on everything
and the profit he gets
You can see this Excel file with calculations on screen
This shows the economic viability  of millet farming in Haryana
The second chart you are seeing
basically divides everything into two parts
On the left side if you farm like a business
you rent land and hire people to work in your fields
in such cases the biggest expense you will bear
is of manpower at 57
Tractor rent is 7 and land rent is 31
In this case you will incur a loss  of around 20000 per acre
So this business model is a failure
The second case is when
you own the land
and you are farming it yourself
then the biggest expense is water and seeds
In such cases you can earn a profit of around 34000 per acre
This is for a year
But if a farmer has to manage  his familys expenses respectively
then 34000 in a year is absolutely nothing
Here he should make at least 2 lakh in annual profits
So even in the second case
for this business model to work
a farmer should own at least 3 acres of land
Looking at this you should get an idea of
how difficult farming is today
This calculation was for millets
But this profit margin increases for rice crops
In this case as you can see on the screen
the profit per acre is 48000 per year
if the farmer owns the land
And if it is done as a business by taking the land on lease
it is possible to make some profit
Approximately 3000 per acre per year in profits
Two things are clearly evident with this
First farmers who own less than 3 acres of land
find it extremely difficult to survive
This is why in many states
farmers have given up farming
and now work as labourers or are unemployed
Only the farmers who own a lot of land
are able to earn a good profit
Second this shows the importance of MSP
Looking at the market price if grains like  millet are not profitable for the farmers
then farmers will not grow millet
Only those grains will be preferred
that can bring them higher profits
leading to environmental damage
More water will have to be used
and our health will suffer too
Because grains like millet
are actually better for health
compared to rice and wheat
It is equally important to mention that
according to the Swaminathan report
MSP was not the only safety net for farmers
That report also mentioned that
to empower farmers
we need to build more than 50000  farm schools all over the country
Farmers should be taught new ways of innovation
Knowledge should lead their empowerment
The second report of the Swaminathan Committe stated that
villages should have food grain banks to prepare for natural calamities
We saw the COVID19 pandemic
and how there were some people who starved to deth
MS Swaminathan was a visionary man
He knew that any natural calamity could happen at any time
and food grain banks are essential to protect ourselves from it
In his report he appreciated Odishas culture
In Odisha it is cultural
to see seed banks in villages
It is actually the Ministry of Agricultures job
to help in the establishment of rural  godowns warehouses and coal storage
And then the use of this infrastructure  should be subsidised for hill farmers
But oh no!
If this happens how will PM Modis friend  Gautam Adani run his business?
In a previous video I talked about how
in 2021 there was an incident
where Gautam Adanis company paid only 12 per kg of apples
It was lower than the cost of production
The maximum that their company paid
was 72 per kilo
for premium 100 colour apples
And these apples were later sold for 250 per kilo in the market
A farmer Dimple Panjta told The Wire how
Adani had bought Agrade apples  for 65 per kilo in 2011
Ten years later they paid only 7 per kilo more to buy those apples
Why is this so?
Because according to the Swaminathan report
the sufficient cold storage facilities that  were supposed to be built for the farmers
were never built
If the farmers do not have the right conditions for storage
they will either have to sell their produce
or else the apples would rot
Many farmers across the country  are blackmailed like this
Dimple Panjta also said that
his NGO found out how Adani
was sold the land at dirt cheap prices
in many places in the Shimla district
to build three cold storage centres
Now can you understand the struggles  faced by the farmers in our country?
Today the government has awarded M S Swaminathan with a Bharat Ratna
But if a farmer talks about implementing the Swaminathan report
then their voice is suppressed
They are attacked with tear gas
And what does the media do in all this?
The media tries to defame the farmers
These TV news anchors
spread propaganda against the farmers
Fake news about them being Khalistanis
and traitors are run
Sometimes they claim that the farmers  demand will be the end of the Indian economy
I will talk about this in a moment
but think about it
When the farmers are not actively protesting
how many times does the media talk about the farmers?
When the farmers commit su!cide every day
when they are forced to sell onions for 2 per kilo
how many debates are organised by these news channels?
YouTuber Ramit Verma analysed 202 debates  on four Hindi news channels
Aaj Tak News18 Zee News and India TV
out of these 202 primetime debates
how many debates were on farmers
and the unemployed youth?
Absolutely zero
Agriculture expert P Sainath says that
69 of our countrys population still lives in villages
But what is the share of news from rural India
on the front page of newspapers?
Only 067
During the last farmers protest
5072 news stories were published in 5 months
Out of those only 07 news stories were about
the increasing cost of production
Only 27 even mentioned the demand for MSP
So when farmers are dying or going through rough times
the media remains silent
But as soon as they raise their voice
to get an MSP
a minimum price for them to barely live on
these TV channels begin their propaganda
One YouTuber said that
if the government gave in to the  farmers demands and implemented MSP
then it will cost us 10 Trillion!
Another said it would be 18 trillion
They lie so much that
the news article they use while lying
catches them in their lie in the same second
Rs 10 lakh crore 10 Trillion is misinformation
First the MSP that is being given now
and the new MSP that is demanded
only the difference between the two should be considered
to calculate the extra money spent by the government
According to a CRISIL study
which examined 16 out of 23 crops with an MSP
they estimate that the real cost of legalising MSP
will be only around 210 billion
for the marketing year 2023
Second agriculture expert Devinder Sharma states that
the government doesnt buy everything from the farmers
The government buys produce on MSP only when
the market prices crash
The main burden of buying at MSP
will be on the private players
According to the Swaminathan report
MSP should be applied to private companies as well
So if someone has to bear the expenses
it is the middlemen corporate companies  who are already earning millions
And what is the issue with them paying  a minimum support price to the farmers
when similar laws already exist in other industries?
When a company hires an employee
does the minimum wage law apply or not?
Similarly when a company buys produce from a farmer
a minimum support price law can be applicable
Now someone might say that
this goes against the principles of the free market
How can a government impose such regulations?
We should have a free market
But I would like to ask you
when Adani buys apples for 12 per kg from the farmers
is this a free market?
When rules are changed
and 6 airports are given to Adani on a serving tray
is this a free market?
The white revolution in India
didnt happen because of the free market
It happened due to the Governments protectionism
It happened because of the milk cooperatives
I talked about this in the video on Amul
People hear the phrase free market
and start using it
Before using such heavy words
people should understand the philosophy of Adam Smith
David Ricardo Labour theory Karl Marx
John Maynard Keynes
Only after understanding these
should one make an opinion about  what free market is and what it is not
You dont have to understand all these complexities
Just watch this video
I bought this for 25
theres 100 grams of corn
How much did the farmers make?
If they sell 100g of corn for 25
they should have been insanely rich
But no
that doesnt happen
The reality is different
This is such a simple concept
shared by Facebook user Priyanka Singh
She calls herself a farmers daughter
She bought a 100g packet of sweet corn
It was priced at Rs 25
This means that 1 kg of sweet corn costs 250
Now how much does a farmer get out of this 250?
We discussed MSP in this video
If MSP is applied
the farmer will get 21 per kg
Out of 250 we are talking about only 21 per kg
Even after implementing MSP  the farmer will get only this amount
That is the middleman
will still keep about 230 out of it
Is it wrong for the farmer to get  even this minimum price?
Its your turn share your opinion in the comment below
If you liked this video then watch this video too
in which I have explained how the government
is manipulating the laws for other industries
just to benefit their crony capitalist friends
It might be shocking for you
