Hello friends!
On 11th April 1970
a rocket launched for the Apollo 13 mission  from Kennedy Space Center in America
Three astronauts were on it
going to the moon
But the interesting thing was that
not even a year had passed since the day
when Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon for the first time
This was already the third NASA mission
to send humans to the moon
Seeing the success of the last two missions
the astronauts in this rocket were very confident about their mission
and their dream
Their dream was to set foot on the moon
But at that time they were unaware that
their dream would never come true
In April 1970
when their spacecraft was about 330000 km away from the Earth
they heard a loud bang suddenly
A huge bang that shook the entire spacecraft
Within a few seconds the warning lights and alarms start going on
It was found that one of the oxygen tanks had burst
And the other oxygen tank was leaking rapidly
Okay Houston weve had a problem here
This is Houston say again please
Houston we have a problem
The mission control on the ground couldnt believe it
They believed that the instruments were malfunctioning
But the astronauts in the spacecraft could see through the window
that the air was leaking
On the other hand they see that because of the blast
the spacecraft had shifted from its path so much that
it was going kilometres away from the Earth every second
Within a few hours the astronauts in Apollo 13
were so far away from the Earth that
it became a new record
To date no human has gone so far from the Earth
as these three astronauts did
during the Apollo 13 mission
Forget landing on the moon
the question back then was
whether they could return to Earth alive
This is the distressing story of Apollo 13
Carbon dioxide levels in the module are rising
The crew were beginning to suffer
It was a dire state
It was a really really emergency situation
In 1961 American President John F Kennedy
promised the world that
before the end of the decade
he would have humans on the moon
achieving the goal
before this decade is out
of landing a man on the moon
and returning him safely to the Earth
This promise should be seen in the context of the Cold War
At that time America and the Soviet Union were engaged in a race
A space race
Who will be the leader in the field of technology?
In 1969
both Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions were successful
Astronauts did not only step on the moon
but also safely returned to Earth
Kennedys promise was fulfilled
But it had a side effect
right after it the peoples and governments interest
in spending money on space
decreased drastically
Its obvious that people were excited
to see a man step on the moon for the first time
But people cannot be so excited for the second third and fourth time
The interest in the moon is fading fast
People believed that Apollo 13
would just be another routine flight
For this reason the American government cut NASAs budget
And many future missions that were planned for the new few years
like Apollo 20 were cancelled
Thats why the Apollo 13 mission
came at a crucial time in the history of space travel
NASA had to prove to the American government that
it was still worth spending money on space
Thats why the primary mission objective of Apollo 13 was
not only to inspect and survey the moons soil
but to also develop the human capability
to work in the moons environment
The main mission objective of Apollo 13
is scientific exploration of the moon
We hope to find out a lot about the origin of the moon
and from that the origin of our own planet Earth
The design of Apollo 13s spacecraft
was similar to that of the previous space missions
Mainly there were four main components
Command module service module
lunar module and launch escape system
The spacecraft was launched on a Saturn V rocket
All three astronauts were seated in the command module
which was the main part of the spacecraft
But it was a small part
The command module is just this cone shape
which is only 11 feet long
and has a diameter of 13 feet
All the instrument panels navigation gear
radios life support system
and small engines were all in this command module
The second most important part was the service module
which had most of the oxygen for the astronauts
It had some more engines too
and fuel cells to generate electricity
The command and service module is often
collectively called the command and service module
or CSM in short form
They are connected during the entire mission
until the astronauts return to Earth
And only during the reentry to Earth
are they separated from each other
The third part was the lunar module
which was actually supposed to land on the moon
And once the work on moon was over
it was supposed to get attached to the CSM module once again
The fourth part the Launch Escape System
was not so important for the mission
Its only task was to protect the astronauts from an accident during the launch
It works like this
If theres an accident during the rocket launch
and the rocket catches fire
it safely ejects the astronauts
and takes them away from the accident
You can see in this video
where this abort system was being tested
But if everything goes well in the launch
then the LES is not needed
and it is ejected and thrown away
On 11th April 1970
since Apollo 13 launched safely and successfully
the LES was not needed
3 astronauts were on the spacecraft
Commander Jim Lovell
the pilot of the Lunar Module Fred Haise
and the third pilot of the Command Module Jack Swigert
Coincidentally according to the original plan
none of these three were chosen for this mission
Originally three different astronauts were chosen for this mission
But they all had different problems because of which
they were not able to participate in this mission
For this reason the crew of these three astronauts takes off from the Earth
To see this rocket launch
there were around 200000 spectators on the ground
This was a small number
compared to the Apollo 11 liftoff the previous year
That had 7 million spectators for the rocket launch
NASA again realized
how quickly people lost their interest in space exploration
But if we talk about the mission
this spacecraft took off smoothly towards its destination
It was supposed to take 3 days for them  to reach the Fra Mauro crater of the moon
This is a big hole on the moons surface
A crater
Which is believed to contain a lot of information
not only about the moon but also about the Earth
The biggest problem during the first 2 days of the flight was when
astronaut Jack Swigert realized that
he had forgotten to file his income tax return
He asked the mission control on Earth
whether he could get an extension
He got a goodhumoured reply that
that he could get a 60day extension
This conversation proves that
everything was going right
During the first two days there were no problems in the mission
At 46 hours 43 minutes of the mission
the capsule communicator on duty at that time said that
the spacecraft was in a good shape
and that they were bored sitting there
This is Apollo Control at 46 hours 43 minutes
Spacecraft is in real good shape as far as were concerned Jim
Were bored to tears down here
Things were going so smoothly that
people were getting bored
By the way you will feel very strange to hear this
but intentionally giving yourself time to get bored
is a good habit in my opinion
I believe that if you want to maximize your productivity and creativity
then you have to leave sometime free during the day
A timewhen you are literally doing nothing
just getting bored
This is very important to relax the mind
especially in todays world
If a person gets bored for 5 seconds
he starts scrolling through his phone
This is the big secret
as to how I can manage my time so efficiently
and consistently manage to give you so many videos
And that too while continuously travelling
I have shared many more such secrets and practical tips
in my time management course
A course that gives you stepbystep solutions
on how you can take out more time for things in your life
and maximize your productivity and creativity

Now lets get back to the topic
The third day of the mission
13th April
the crew is told that
they have to do some tests on the lunar module
And apart from this
they have to do a broadcast for the television
Where they will use the cameras
to show the interiors of the command module and service module to the world
Now the audiences interest in this was so low that
no television network showed this broadcast at that time
Commander Lovells wife
went to the VIP section of the mission control to watch this broadcast
About 6 and a half minutes after the end of the TV broadcast
the flight controllers on the ground
asked astronaut Swigert
to check the oxygen level
There was nothing unusual in this
It was just a routine check of the oxygen tanks in the service module
And while this check was being done
suddenly a huge explosion occurred
Many warning lights and alarms went off
As I told you at the beginning of the video
the astronauts in the spacecraft were largely in shock
Commander Lovell contacted Mission Control and said
Houston weve have had a problem
It turned out that one tank of oxygen was completely empty
and the oxygen level in the other tank was going down rapidly
Mission Control on the ground first thought that
the instruments must be showing the wrong data
but that was the truth
Everyone needed to take action urgently
if they wanted to save the lives of these astronauts
The TV channels that had called this mission boring
and were not showing it on the news
made this the news headlines suddenly
Apollo 13 to the moon
is in serious jeopardy this morning
And it is not going to make a moon landing
The oxygen tanks in the spacecraft
were sphereshaped
In these oxygen was stored in liquid form
There was a heater at the center
which converted the liquid oxygen into gas
On Apollo 13 there were two such tanks in the service module
The tank number 2
was originally installed in Apollo 10
but was removed from there for modification
And a minor accident happened with it
It accidentally fell down during repair
and was damaged
The tube inside it was damaged
but no one saw it during the inspection
While testing it
people noticed that the tank
would not be completely empty
To get rid of the remaining oxygen
heaters were used to boil it completely
Later it was found that the thermometer inside it
could show a maximum temperature of 30C
But when the heater was used to heat the oxygen in the tank
the temperature would reach as high as 538C
No one noticed this extreme heating
because it did not register in the thermometer
Due to this extreme heating
the insulation of the electrical wires in the tank were damaged
Before the mission NASAs managers and engineers
had approved the tank after a thorough investigation
but they were unable to see the internal damage
And because of this
during the Apollo 13 mission
during the routine check of the tank on the third day
due to those electric wires
there was a spark and the tank explodes
It was only by chance that the tank was attached to the exterior of the spacecraft
Had it been attached inside the spacecraft and exploded there
then all the astronauts would have been k!lled instantly
But because it was on the outside
the explosion occurred outside
And only a 13foot panel was damaged in the service module
What else was damaged in the spacecraft?
The astronauts were not so sure
Now everyone had to make an important decision
Which way could they take to return to Earth?
The fastest way to return to Earth was to
rotate the spacecraft
But to do this
the main engine of the service module had to be started
The main engine was located near the blast in the CSM module
No one knew whether the engine was damaged or not
The second way to return to Earth was to
go towards the moon
and circle around the moon
to return to the Earth
For this the engine of the service module would not be required
But the risk was that
it would take 45 days to return to Earth
Did the astronauts have enough oxygen and water left?
NASAs flight director chose the second option
To take the long way back
The astronauts were told to shut down the CSM module immediately
And while returning
they were told to use the lunar module as a lifeboat
Though this decision was a safe option it did have several problems
The lunar module was designed in such a way that
only two astronauts could sit in it
for about 20 hours
Because as I told you
its original purpose was to land on the moon
and get attached to the CSM module again
But now it was expected that
these three people would sit in the lunar module
for 45 days
The engines of the lunar module were not designed in a way that
they could be fired repeatedly
To a large extent this was also a risky manoeuvre
To conserve supplies and energy
the astronauts were told to shut down all nonessential systems in the spacecraft
including the heaters that were installed
It was very important to save electricity
As per this plan the astronauts sat in the Lunar Module
and for the first time the engines of the Lunar Module were fired
When an engine is started it is called a Burn
So they do the first Burn
to get on the new path
With the help of this burn
they reached the other side of the moon
The far side of the moon
They became the first humans in the world
to go so far from the Earth
And this record remains unbeatable even now
At their furthest point they were 400000 km away from the Earth
If they stayed on this path
they could reach the Earth about 153 hours after launch
But this time margin was very risky
If they reached Earth after so long
then only 1 hour of surplus food water and oxygen would remain for the astronauts
NASA team on the ground believed that this margin is very narrow
Thats why the astronauts were told to
burn the lunar module engine for the second time
The engineers in the mission control had done many calculations
to find out whether the lunar module engine
will be able to handle the second burn or not
These calculations proved correct
when the second burn is done
the flight time of 153 hours
was reduced to 143 hours
An 11hour long margin of survival
Before the astronauts could relax
another problem arose
The high concentration of carbon dioxide
In spaceships apart from oxygen tanks
there are canisters of lithium hydroxide to remove carbon dioxide
When astronauts breathe in oxygen
they breathe out carbon dioxide
If that carbon dioxide is not removed
it will result in a large amount of carbon dioxide which can be problematic
That is why canisters of lithium hydroxide are used
so that carbon dioxide reacts with it
and becomes lithium carbonate
But the problem here was that
the canisters of lithium hydroxide in the lunar module
were enough for only two people to survive for 2 days
But here there were 3 people
who wanted to survive for 4 days
The good thing here was that
there were some canisters in the command module too
But their filter was square
and the ones in lunar module had a circular shape
The experts on the ground had 24 hours to solve this problem
Astronauts from the spacecraft communicated to tell them
about all things present around them
Plastic bags cardboard some suit hoses some duct tape
They wanted to create something that could be the solution to this problem
After a few hours of experimenting
they make a contraption to make this work
After giving stepbystep instructions
a new device was created with the things present there
with which the level of carbon dioxide decreases again
Commander Lovell in his book Lost Moon states that
the contraption wasnt very handsome but it worked
The thing they made looked like this
In this entire rescue mission even the smallest details were taken care of
Astronauts were instructed
not to drink more than 200 ml of water in a day
Because if they drink more water
they will need to ur!nate
And in this way the quantity of their ur!ne
could change the direction of the spaceship
Thats why they needed to survive by drinking so little water
These 3 astronauts lost 14 kgs of weight in total
Astronaut Haise gets a urinary tract infection
After 4 days when Apollo 13s spacecraft reaches Earth
astronauts realize that they need to burn once more
In their calculations
they hadnt taken into account the cooling vapour present in the spacecraft
This caused the spacecraft to wander off the track
Commander Lovell carried out another burn of the lunar module
which brings the spacecraft back on track
Thankfully the spacecraft could withstand the third burn too
Even though this lunar module was designed to withstand only one burn
The whole world was holding their breaths and watching the news channels
And were waiting for the astronauts to return to Earth
The family members and friends of the astronauts
were watching this play out on TV together
Now the biggest question was
when this broken spacecraft enters the Earths atmosphere
will the spacecraft be about to sustain the heat impact?
Will the astronauts be able to survive?
For this part the astronauts had to return to the command module
because only the command module was made for reentry on the Earth
As soon as the command module entered the Earths atmosphere
there was a communication blackout
This was normal because
due to ionization of the air
the radio waves get blocked
and communication cannot be done
between the NASA employees present on the ground
and the astronauts in the spacecraft
Usually this communication blackout is for 2 to 3 minutes
It was expected that the communication blackout here
would be for a maximum of 3 minutes
3 minutes were over
but there was no answer from the other side
10 seconds pass
30 seconds
60 seconds
Even after 4 minutes
there was no communication from the spacecraft
Could the astronauts survive or not?
4 minutes and 27 seconds later
finally communication was received from the other side
The people watching it on television could finally breathe again
All three astronauts survived
The parachute was deployed in the command module
and it slowly fell into the Pacific Ocean
Teamwork was necessary
Good leadership
Initiative to think outside of the box
When things go wrong
how do we repair them?
Those are the three things
that were absolutely necessary
The three astronauts return home safe and sound
Although this mission failed
none of the three astronauts set foot on the moon
But still this Apollo 13 mission
made its mark on the pages of history
Showing this historical rescue mission of the Apollo 13
and the bravery of the astronauts
Several books are written on it
and films are made
After the investigation of this incident
many safety measures are adopted by NASA
So that there could be no such accidents in future missions
After Apollo 13
Apollo 14 Apollo 15
Apollo 16 and Apollo 17
all these missions were successful
On 7th December 1972
Apollo 17 was the last mission
by NASA under the Apollo program
The astronauts in this mission spent 3 days on the surface of the moon
And this was the last time till today
when humans went to the moon
What is the reason behind this?
You will get the answer to this question in my Apollo 11 video
In that video I discussed Neil Armstrongs mission
