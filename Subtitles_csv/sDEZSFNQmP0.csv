Hello friends
It has been more than 1 month since the Hindenburg Report was published
Even now new allegations are being levied against the Adani Group one after the other
A few days ago Wikipedia accused the Adani Group
Of manipulating the Wikipedia pages
By using fake accounts and undeclared paid editors
Before this it was discussed in Parliament as well
When Congress leader Rahul Gandhi
And TMC leader Mahua Moitra
Questioned Prime Minister Modi
About his alleged relationship with Adani
A photo was presented at the Parliament
Of Prime Minister Modi with Adani
Which caused a lot of uproars
And later Rahul Gandhis remarks were removed from Parliament records
What were the accusations?
How true are they?
Come in this video lets try to figure it out
Mr Adani and Mr Modi are in it together
The person whose planes PM Modi uses to travel
The person whose fundings run BJP
A slew of deals across sectors from defence to airports to power
Almost always went to the Adani group
All of the funds are going to one person
What is his relationship with Indias Prime Minister?
Before beginning this video
Its important to mention one thing
This isnt the first time that a corporate group is facing severe allegations
Before this we witnessed the Harshad Mehta Scam
Satyam Scam Sahara Scam
Allegations on Vijay Mallya Lalit Modi
Nirav Modi Mehul Choksi
Putting aside corporate groups and individuals
Such accusations have been levied on the previous governments too
The Congress government had to face the
Bofors Scam Augusta Westland Scam
2G Spectrum Scam Commonwealth Scam
But whats happening now has perhaps never happened in the history of the nation
This is the first time that in an alleged scam
Public money was lost
But a faction of the people has come forward
Not to demand an investigation
But rather to defend the company and government
A trend is created on Twitter IStandWithAdani
These people whore supporting Adani
Had they been Adanis employees or investors
It would have been understandable to a large extent
But a significant of them are neither employees nor stockholders of Adani
Even so they are at the front line to defend Adani
Can you imagine someone running a trend of
IStandWithVijayMallya for Vijay Mallyas case?
Imagine someone defending the Commonwealth Games
Saying that there should be no investigation into it
There should be no questions as no wrong was done
This is why friends I believe that the biggest scam here
Is being done with the peoples minds
Basic logic common sense and the basic understanding of democracy
Has been trampled over
They say that Adani shouldnt be questioned
Because Adani is an Indian businessman
That Adani group provides so many jobs
That they have contributed to the development of India
Does this make any sense?
For some basic understanding lets try to understand
The contribution of the Adani Group
Lets look at the jobs
Adani was the richest person in India once
Asias richest person
In fact the second richest person in the world
Then his net worth was 1244 TRILLION!
After the Hindenburg report
The net worth has significantly decreased
But even now at the time of shooting this video
According to Bloomberg his Net Worth is said to be 43 Trillion
Such a wealthy man
With so many companies under his control
So his companies must be employing millions of people right?
You might think that
But according to Adanis official website
The Adani Group employs about 23000 people
Only 23000 jobs
But you might feel that it isnt a fair comparison
And that we should compare it to other private companies only
So lets do that
The number 1 private company that to provide the most number of jobs in India
are the Tata Group of companies
More than 900000 jobs
Then comes Infosys with more than 300000 jobs
Reliance Industries provides 236000 jobs
Wipro provides 231000 jobs
Adanis companies do not appear even in the List of Top 25
Take the government company Coal India
That has 272445 employees
Indian Railways 125 million employees
A company like Amul provides livelihood to 36 million farmers
Overall Indian Agriculture employs more than 150 million people
When you look at the numbers
Adani Group doesnt make a significant contribution to providing jobs in India
Second even if not in terms of jobs
They would have made a large contribution to the taxes
Since they have such a large Net Worth
Take a look at this list compiled by Business Today
Of Indias Top 10 taxpaying companies
At the top is Reliance followed by SBI TCS
HDFC Vedanta JSW Steel
Indian Oil Corporation Tata Steel ICICI LIC
We dont spot Adani on it
Several people pointed this out
Companies of Indias richest person
Arent among the Top 10 taxpayer companies
How could this be?
An explanation for this can be
That tax is levied on profit
Not on Net Worth
So lets take a look at the profits
According to MoneyControlcom
Profit of Adani Enterprises for 12 months as on March 2022
Was 1113 Billion
Dont you think this is suspicious?
The amount of tax paid by the other companies
Is more than the profit made by Adani
If the business isnt very profitable
Why do they have such high valuations?
Did these companies make any groundbreaking innovations?
Or did they create any heavily used technology?
Similar to companies like Apple Google Facebook and Tesla
That doesnt seem like the case
So why?
Perhaps the answer is hidden in the accusations
Come lets look at the new allegations one by one
Especially the allegations from the Indian Parliament
The first allegation is of a Land Scam
This was when Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat
Back then various industrial groups needed land in Gujarat for their projects
So they bought land there
K Raheja Corp bought land at 470m
Maruti Suzuki got land at 670m
Ford India Tata Motors and TCS paid 1100m
Torrent Power had to pay 6000m
But when Adani purchased land to build a port
They were given the land at a mere 32m
This was the maximum
In places the price was as low as 1m
Im not making this up
This is the headline of the Business Standard article from 26th April 2014
So theres an accusation of a land scam
After this in April 2015
CAG presented its report to the Gujarat Assembly
They claimed that the Gujarat government did not classify forest land correctly
Due to this the Goutam Adanipromoted Mundra Port benefitted by 5864 million
This happened in 200809
After this in 2022 the Public Accounts Committee reiterated the same thing
They said that the land was supposed to be classified as Eco Class2
But it was classified as Eco Class4
Which led to the government losing 5867 million
The government losing money means
The loss of public funds
The second accusation is the misutilisation of forest land
Narendra Modi was sworn in as the Prime Minister in 2014
And look at this report in The Times of India from 24th October 2014
Centre clears 370acre forest land for Adanis coalbased thermal power plant
This was in Maharastra
After this in 2018 142 acres of land was further sanctioned
This time by both the Central and State government
Both were headed by BJP at the time
The forest department responded by saying that
The forest land demanded by them was the barest minimum
And that giving this land would eventually lead to an increase in employment
Youll ask about the particulars of employment
They claimed that 100 local residents will get jobs
And indirectly 250 residents
350 jobs in total
In March 2018
Adani Group received inprinciple approval
for using about 1550 hectares of forest land
For the Mundra Special Economic Zone
Regarding this the Forest Advisory Committee said that
most of the forest land would be used for nonforestry purposes
The third accusation is of the Airport Scam
In November 2018
The Cabinet approved the privatisation of 6 airports
Here the privatisation of airports is a big deal on its own
Questions need to be asked
The profitable airports that were making money for the government
Why were they privatised?
As long as a profitable organisation is under the governments control
Its profit goes to the government
That can be later used for public welfare
But if it is privatised
Its profits would go to the corporate company
Only that company would benefit
Earlier the excuse was that
The lossmaking public companies
are being privatised
Well its understandable if it is lossmaking
But take the example of ONGC
In Financial Year 202122
It recorded a Net Profit of 400 billion
It became Indias secondmost profitable company after Reliance Industries
Even so the government directed ONGC
to privatise oil and gas fields
Anyway this is a major issue on its own right
For now lets stick to the privatisation of the airports
in November 2018 a committee was formed
Public Private Partnership Appraisal Committee
This committee was tasked with deciding the criteria
To whom the airports should be given after the privatisation
This committee made 2 decisions
First any company purchasing these airports
Need not have any previous experience in this field
And second there is no restriction on
The number of airports one company could bid for
After this all 6 airports went to Adani
Adani companies had no previous experience managing an airport
Friends it is now reported that when this happened
The Finance Ministry and NITI Aayog had raised concerns against this
They said that this would be a big financial risk
To handover the airports to a bidder
With no previous experience in handling airports
could cause performance issues
The quality of services could be compromised
But these objections were overruled
And Adani got 6 airports
In the same category as this alleged Airport Scam
is another alleged scam
The hijacking of the Mumbai Airport
I am not making up these allegations
These allegations were raised by opposition leaders in Parliament
The only reason you dont know about these in detail
is because the media doesnt discuss these
Mumbai airport was under the control of GVK Group
On 28th July 2020
The Enforcement Directorate raided
the Mumbai and Hyderabad offices of the GVK Group
Additionally the office of Mumbai International Airport Limited was raided
It was a joint venture managing the airport
About 1 month after this raid
On 1st September 2020
Adani Group acquired a 74 stake
of Mumbai International Airport
Of this 74 stake 505 stake
was previously held by the GVK Group
that is completely held by Adani now
The question arose if this was a coincidence or collusion
GVK was pressured by
the Indian Government
to hand over the airport to Mr Adani
In December 2021
Minister of State for Civil Aviation General V K Singh
Told the Rajya Sabha that
of the total 8 airports under publicprivate partnership
7 airports are run by Adani Enterprises
In March 2022
SBI underwrites the debt owed by Adanis Navi Mumbai airport
The debt of 12770 billion
You would ask about the meaning of underwriting
So come look at the dictionary definition of it
It means that the banks provide financial support
and take responsibility
of bearing the cost if the company fails
This could be considered a Golden Offer
The 4th allegation here
was the alleged Coal Scam
Opposition leaders have alleged that
when Prime Minister Modi goes on a tour of foreign countries
he doesnt work for Indias benefit
He works for Adanis benefit
He travels with you on your delegations
He meets heads of states on visits to India
He portrays that India is the Prime Minister
And the Prime Minister is him
He makes it appear to the world that
he is the remote control behind the Prime Minister
And by obliging him well be obliging the Prime Minister
Interestingly such allegations arent raised by opposition leaders only
Instead some BJP leaders are doing the same
BJP leader Subramanian Swamy
shared a chronology
Our research team verified whether these news articles were correct
Theyre correct
Listen to the chronology
December 2021
Adani Group started exporting coals from its Australian coal mines
Climate activists had protested against this coal mines previously
May 2022
the Indian government slashes the import duty on coal
From 25 to 0
June 2022
the Modi government directed Coal India
to be prepared for importing 12 million tonnes of coal
June 2022
NTPC awards coal import tenders of 83 billion
to Adani Enterprises
Coincidence? or Collusion?
Subramanian Swamy missed 2 imported reports
May 2022 in India power plants were allowed
the use of blended coal
that contains 30 of imported coal
until March of next year
without the consent of the buyer states
On 26th May an emergency coal blending order was passed regarding this
under Section 11 of the Electricity Act
In July Congress leader Gaurav Vallabh
raised concern about this
Claiming that the government is working for the benefit of its friends
August 2022 this order was retracted
But in January 2023
the central government directed the power generation companies
to use the blend of imported coal
up to 6 of their requirement till September
In this story I missed out on a major point
Government officials had told the Indian Express
that the domestic coal procured from India
costs around 17002000 per tonne
But the coal imported by Adani
costs around 17000 to 20000 per tonne
Goes to show that when publicsector companies
are being directed to use imported coal
they have to pay ten times the costs

And now lets get back to the topic
Lets look at another chronology
related to Sri Lanka
May 2019
the governments of India Japan and Sri Lanka
signed a Memorandum of Cooperation
for the development of the East Container Terminal
At the Columbo Port
Quite commendable
February 2021
Sri Lanka cancels this ECT agreement from 2019
India and Japan werent happy with this
The next month March 2021
Sri Lanka changed the terminal
Instead of the East Container Terminal
the West Container Terminal
But then it says that it will be a joint publicprivate partnership project
Between the Sri Lanka Ports Authority
and Adani Ports and SEZ
In a press release the Sri Lankan government stated that
Their cabinetappointed negotiation committee
had requested the Indian High Commission
and the Japanese Embassy to nominate investors
Japan did not nominate any investor
While the Indian high commission gave approval to Adani ports and SEZ
This isnt the only foreign project which went to Adani
There are numerous such contracts
Related to ports defence electricity
In countries like Sri Lanka Bangladesh and Israel
That were awarded to Adani
TMC leader Mahua Moitra claims
That Adani travels with Prime Minister Modi
on his foreign tours
meets other heads of states
and has created an impression that
he is the remote control managing PM Modi
The next major accusation is of Tax Evasion
Look at this notice issued by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence
Dated 15th May 2014
Several such Show Cause Notices were issued to the Adani Group
Alleging that the Group evades paying taxes
They have not paid taxes properly
To the total amount of 10 billion approximately
There were allegations of using a shell company
And hundreds of millions of dollar were transferred among companies
And sent to tax havens
So that taxes could be avoided
But in August 2017 the adjudicating authority of DRI KVS Singh
Dropped all charges raised by this agency
The ones levied against Adani Power Maharashtra Limited
And Adani Power Rajasthan Limited
The allegations were that the goods imported by them
Were shown at an inflated value
They were talking about approx 39 billion
In February 2018 the Customs department claimed
That those orders were wrong illegal and improper
In 2017 the documents that were leaked to EPW indicate that
Adani Power did not pay the duty on Raw Materials and Consumables
Which amounted to approximately 10 billion
After this the next allegation is loanrelated
In September 2022 when Adanis wealth was at an alltime high
The loans owed by Adani Group touched alltime highs too
22 TRILLION!
On 30th January in an interview by Adani Groups CFO
To CNBC TV18
He stated that the total debt of the Adani Group is at 30 billion
Now 1 is around 82
So 1 billion is about 82 billion
So approximately this is around 248 trillion
Of this around 740 billion
approximately is owed to Indian Banks
From the disclosures made by banks we see that
Adani Group owes 400 billion to SBI
70 billion to PNB
Bank of Baroda declined to openly disclose the amount owed
But according to LiveMints report
It is calculated to be around 538 billion
These are national publicsector banks
And one company owes around 5238 billion to these banks
Another allegation related to the loans is of loan writeoff
The Indian Express filed an RTI in which they were told by RBI that
In the last 5 years the banks have written off about 10 trillion worth of loans
Writeoffs do not mean that the banks will stop trying to recover this money
But the banks have recovered only about 132 trillion of this money till now
That amounts to about only 13 of the writeoffs
In 2018 and 2021 BJP leader Subramanian Swamy accused the Adani Group
Of being an NPA trapeze artist
NPA refers to Bad Loans
Adani countered these allegations by claiming that
The Adani Group does not have any NPAs
The next accusation was regarding Shell Companies
Mahua Moitra talked about Mauritiusbased shell companies
His group companies have amassed nearly
42000 crores 420 billion in Foreign Portfolio Investments
From 6 Mauritiusbased funds
These funds have commonalities
Like common address common company secretary and common directors
She asked why this wasnt invested back in 2019
When she raised the issue in Parliament
Theres an urgent need to investigate these funds
I brought this up in this house in 2019
She mentioned another 40 shell companies
That invested in the Adani Group
She said that the funds were managed by Adanis brother
And a Chinese individual Chang ChungLing
DRI records reveal that
Chang ChungLing and Vinod Adani
Share the same residential address
Adani Group hasnt commented on this allegation
The list of accusations is very long friends
The allegations which I listed out now
Are far from over
If I start listing every allegation this will stretch into a 2hour long video
For now lets see what happened next
Opposition talked about this in Parliament
They demanded a JPC
To create a Join Parliamentary Committee to
conduct an investigation into the allegations
How did BJP respond to this?
BJP asked for proof
Proof for the allegations
I dont understand what proof do they need further?
These news articles on these allegations
Are publicly available
Was land not given to Adani at dirtcheap rates?
If this was indeed wrong why doesnt BJP reveal the rates at which the land was given to Adani?
And if there was no land allocation
Then BJP can say that no land was sold
Were rules changed for these 6 airports?
Was an order not passed to force power generators
to fulfil 10 of their need by imported coal?
Did they not purchase imported coal at 10 times the price of domestic coal?
If not then they can tell us the price it was procured at
What did Prime Minister Modi have to say in response to these allegations?
He asked why Rahul Gandhi doesnt use Nehrus surname
Im not kidding
This was the actual response of Prime Minister Modi in Parliament
I still do not understand
why people from his lineage
Are afraid of using Nehru as their surname
The reason is that Rahul Gandhis surname
Is that of his grandfather
His grandfather Feroze Jahangir Gandhy
A freedom fighter
His surname was spelled Gandhy
During the freedom movement
He was very inspired by Mahatma Gandhi
Even before getting married to Indira Nehru
He had changed his surname to Gandhi
Replaced Y with an I
This is why Jawaharlal Nehrus daughters name
Changed from Indira Nehru to Indira Gandhi
And her sons grandsons granddaughters
Use the same surname
But I believe if it is becoming such an important issue
That it hinders investigation into alleged scams
I will request Rahul Gandhi
To please change his surname
To change his name to Rahul Nehru
So that there can be smooth investigations
What do you think friends?
Major allegations
Severe allegations
With documents to verify these allegations
But on the other hand there is no response
Let alone starting an investigation
There is no demand for an investigation
Media maintains its silence
And when someone tries to speak up on social media
They either run Adanis biography
Or the trend IStandWithAdani
Can you imagine this even happening before in Indias history?
Thank you very much!
