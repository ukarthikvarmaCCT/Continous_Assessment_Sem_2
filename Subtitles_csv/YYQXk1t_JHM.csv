Hello friends!
Formula 1 racing is a sport which saw a boost in popularity recently
It is one of the most dangerous sports in the world
While driving the F1 cars
The temperature is normally at 45C for the driver
And can go up to 60C
Theres so much heat and humidity that in a normal race
The F1 driver loses about 23 kg in weight
Simply by completing a race
Because they sweat so much
And also during the way
I lose up to 4 kilos in a race in an hour and 45 minutes
But this is because it gets so hot isnt it?
So if youre in Singapore or Malaysia or something
Yeah those ones are killer
The cars are driven at such high speeds
That at every turn the driver has to bear high G forces
Up to 6 Gs
Come in todays video lets understand
How this game actually works
What is its BillionDollar Business Model?
And should it even be considered a sport?
Formula 1 is the most exciting sport on the planet!
Grand Prix!
F1 is all about pushing the limits of speed
science and nerves
Friends Formula 1 originated in France
In 1906 a race was held
It was called the French Grand Prix
These words should sound like rnd prks
But since its a French term
Its pronounced as grahn pri
It literally means the Great Prize
Since then the name Grand Prix continued
And till now during Formula 1 racing
This name is used
Back then car races did not test the speed of the driver
Rather they focused on the endurance of the driver
Literally the race would stretch from one city to another on normal roads
In fact the first Grand Prix race lasted 24 hours
And was held in Le Mans
If you have watched the film Ford v Ferrari
It was based on this race
In 1904 an international association was established
It is now known as FiA
Fdration Internationale de lAutomobile
This is the governing body of Formula 1 FiA
Similar to FIFA for football
And ICC for cricket
It was only after 1946
That professional racing began to be conducted in an organised manner
Some rules were drafted in 1947
known as the Formulas
The duration of the races
The types of cars that could be used for the races
That the racing cars should be a single seater
That it should be an open wheel
Open wheel means that the wheels of the car extend outwards from its body
Today a typical Formula 1 race car looks like this
But before we get to the car
Lets get to the Formula 1 Championship
The first season of the World Championship was announced in 1950
A championship with 7 races across 7 countries
This first Championship was won by an Italian driver
driving for the Alfa Romeo team
Friends now in the 2023 Championship season
There will be 23 races
If the names of the team seem familiar
Its because most of the teams in Formula 1 racing
Are car manufacturers
Friends here comes the most unique aspect of Formula 1 racing
Winning a Formula 1 Championship
doesnt depend solely on the skill of the driver
On how well the driver can drive
But it also depends on how well the car was made
This game is a competition of technology as well
To see who can manufacture the fastest car
This is why several car manufacturers
Participate in Formula 1 Championship
Other than the publicity of these companies
Another benefit to them is that
When new technologies would be innovated during Formula 1
Those technologies can be later used for manufacturing consumer cars
The cars commonly sold to average people can also be improved
Friends there are several examples of this
Technologies that are nowadays used in most common cars
That were first discovered during F1
For example Carbon Fibre
A material that is used in BMW Aston Martin and Porsche cars now
It was used for the first time in 1981 by McLaren in Formula 1
The first company to build a car chassis with this material
This was an expensive but light material
It improved fuel efficiency
Some other examples of such technology are
Using Hybrid Powertrains and Wheel Buttons
The rules of the competition force the companies to
innovate even the tiniest aspect
So that the cars can be as fast as possible
The current world record for the fastest speed is 3725 kmhr
This happened during a race in Mexico in 2016
This speed record is held by Valtteri Bottas
But other than in an actual race
The full potential of an F1 car was seen in 2005
When Hondas team achieved 3977 kmhr
This was for the purpose of the record test
This test was conducted in a very special place
A dry lake bed where for kilometres around
Theres only a plain field like this
But normally the speed of the F1 cars is so high that
It is faster than the takeoff speed of an airplane
When a large airplane takes off
Its speed is around 250 kmhr
Friends do you know what this means?
Had there been wings on these cars
These cars wouldve flown
Even without wings they could easily take off
This is the reason for the peculiar shape at the back of the cars
These are wings to counter the wings that planes have
In school you wouldve studied that the shape of the wings of an airplane
Aims to create a lift
High pressure and low pressure on either side
Allowing the plane to take off
In the F1 cars its the opposite
It creates a negative lift
So that the cars can be pushed onto the track
The downforce produced is equal to 5G
A force of 5 times the weight of the car
Pushes it downwards
This provides traction to the tires
enabling them to execute sharp turns
At the beginning of the video I told you
That Formula 1 is an extremely dangerous sport
It is believed to be one of the most dangerous sports in the world
When driving in daytoday life has turned so dangerous
With the high chances of a person dying in a car accident
This is such a high speed sport
Obviously this would have an added danger
In total 52 drivers have died since Formula 1 racing began
The most famous accident was of
The threetime champion Ayrton Sennas death in 1994
In 1970 one driver died
And was posthumously awarded the championship
This happened for the Austrian driver Jochen Rindt
Simply because drivers accumulate points over different races
Even after Rindts death no driver could
catch up to his accumulated points in that season
So he was given the winners trophy after his death
But specifically speaking
several steps are taken to ensure safety during Formula 1 races
Obviously the first is providing helmets by the companies compulsorily
These are stronger than normal helmets
They have carbonfibre head and neck support
So that the vertebrate of a driver can be protected in case of any crash
Additionally the suit that the drivers wear
Is made of multilayered fireproof material
In case the car catches fire in an accident
At least their clothes wont catch fire
Drivers are equipped with biometric gloves
The gloves are fitted with sensors that
constantly measure and transmit vitals such as heartbeats to medical staff
The seatbelts in the car are so tight that
The help of another person is required
To fasten the seatbelt
There are fire extinguishers in the cars too
but the most groundbreaking innovation in terms of safety was in 2018
when this Halo was introduced
Halo is basically a steel bar
that is placed above the head in these cars
It is made of Grade 5 Titanium
Its purpose is to protect the drivers head in case the car is upturned
When this was introduced in 2018
this angered several people
they were infuriated because the cars wouldnt have an open cockpit anymore
They claimed that it looked ugly
and was an unnecessary addition
But since then it has been 45 years
this innovation has saved the lives of many drivers
The Halo is the strongest part of an F1 car
It is strong enough to sustain the weight of 2 African elephants on top of it
So yeah such safety innovations took place in recent times
to make the sport safer
These F1 cars are truly engineering marvels
Years of knowledge accumulated
to craft these to perfection
Friends this is why today for a new company
it is so difficult to enter this business
Money isnt the only factor
This requires years of knowledge and persistence
As Aamir Khan said in 3 Idiots

And now lets get back to the topic
Lets talk about the Business Model
How does the financial aspect work?
2 types of companies are involved in Formula 1 racing
The constructor companies that make cars
And the engine manufacturer companies
that make engines
Presently there are about 10 constructor companies namely Alpha Romeo
Alphatauri Alpine Astin Martin
Ferrari Haas McLaren
Mercedes Red Bull and Williams
But only 4 companies manufacture engines
Ferrari Mercedes Renault and Honda
Ferraris team is the most successful team in the history of Formula 1
They have won 16 constructor titles and 15 driver titles
A point to note here is that
in a Formula 1 Championship
theres a winning driver and a winning constructor
Each team has 2 drivers
A team can be a constructor champion
by taking into account the performance of both drivers
But a driver championship can be won
when a driver gets the most points at an individual level
Since the make of the car plays such an important role
some people argue that more than the skills of the driver
the construction of the car is more important for winning a race
So often it so happens that
the best drivers do not win as many championships
For example many F1 fans believe that
Fernando Alonso has been the best driver in the history of F1
In terms of technique
But he has won only 2 championships
In 2005 and 2006 with Renault
Since the construction of the car plays such an important role in this game
it means that a large amount of money is involved here
To some extent the team with more money
could use better technology and strategies for their cars
But its interesting to see that
it is a risky business for companies to participate in Formula 1
Lets look at the financials of Red Bull
This team has recently won a Constructor Championship
and the winning drivers were from this team as well
In 2018 their sister team Toro Rosso
spend 1811 million in total
Its around 15 billion
And their revenue was at 1836 million
Their spending and earnings
had a minute difference
Their profit was only 18 million
Only 150 million after taxes
Its very little profit considering the money being spent here
And this was a toplevel team
The companies believe that the return on investment theyd get
from other sources would be much better
Such as publicity and the progress in technology
In 2022 FiA placed a cap on the budget
140 million
No team can spend more than this
So that theres some equality in the competition
This year in 2023 this cap has been lowered to
135 million
The salary of the drivers are paid by the teams
but that is kept outside the budget cap restrictions
So theres no limit to the salary paid to the drivers
It means that similar to other sports
theres a large inequality in the salaries paid to the drivers
Some premium drivers toplevel drivers
are paid much higher salaries than others
Such as Max Verstappen
He has been the Driver Champion for the last 2 years
Its estimated that last year
he was paid around 60 million in the year
Compare it to Mick Schumachers salary
who was paid only 1 million for the same year
Obviously the salary depends on several things
Other than the drivers success
it is also dependent on the team for which the driver is driving
the level it is at and how much money it has
Mick Schumacher races for the Haas team
that is still growing
Presently though there are no Indian teams in Formula 1 racing
but there is an Indian connection to the F1
Till now we had 2 Indian drivers
Narain Karthikeyan
And Karun Chandhok
They drove and participated in the Championship for 3 years and 2 years respectively
But perhaps a better highlight for India was that
India had a team in Formula 1
Force India
The team was created in 1991
when it was known as Spyker F1
Under different ownership
but in 2007 Vijaya Mallya and Michiel Mol director of the team bought it
And its name was changed to Force India
It debuted in 2008
The same year the expenses of this team
rose by 744
The biggest increase till date
Back then the primary sponsors of the team were Kingfisher
RIL and ICICI bank
In 2011 Sahara India Pariwar bought 425 shares of this team
Mallya was left with 425  and Michiel Mol with 15 shares
And so the team was renamed again
to Sahara Force India
Friends in its short career this team wasnt very successful
but with time it was definitely improving
The drivers were showing promise
In fact even this year 3 drivers from that team would be racing
Nice Hulkenberg for Haas
Sergio Perez for Red Bull
And Esteban Ocon for Alpine
Till 2017 the Force India team improved year after year
Each season their performance was better than the last
2017 was the best year
when Perez and Ocon were their drivers
In 201617 their ranking was in 4th place
Thats not bad
It had become a midlevel team
And then came 2018 when its downfall began
The thing is each year theres a summer break in Formula 1
It is usually 2 weeks long
That year in July 2018
just before the summer break
documents were released as to how this company
had only 315000 in the bank
While it had taken out loans of 37 million
This company owed a lot of money
And youd remember Vijay Mallya
Vijay Mallya was accused
of owing about 100 billion to Indian banks
In 2016 he fled from India
and has been staying in the UK since then
A worldwide freezing order was issued on his assets
he could not sell his assets
And that banks could seize his assets
It meant that if he wanted to sell the shares of this team
he would need the consent of Indian banks
Finally a Canadian businessman Lawrence Stroll
bought the team and its assets
at the cost of 96 billion
Before the restart of the 2018 season
The businessman Lawrence Strolls son
Lance Stroll was a driver of this team in the F1
FiA ordered that this team had to be renamed yet again
since the ownership was changing
This was renamed Racing Point Force India
The next year in 2019 the word India was dropped from the name of the team
And it became Racing Point
In 2021 it was renamed one more time
Aston Martin F1 Team
When Stroll purchased a 17 stake in this car manufacturing company
In India ED claims that
Vijay Mallya used his F1 and IPL teams for money laundering
And Subrata Roy owner of Sahara Pariwar
had built his empire on scams
Today the Formula 1 sport is often criticised
as a useless sport
That no one is benefiting from these car races
And that it merely causes environmental pollution and nothing else
Perhaps Some points of criticism are valid
This is why Formula E has been introduced
Wherein only electric cars would be racing
About 10 years later
a Formula E event was hosted in Hyderabad India some months ago
This event took place on a street circuit
Race tracks werent built for this
The existing roads were closed off
and prepared for this race
Till 2039
Formula E rights have been assigned by the FiA
After which it is expected that
Formula 1 and Formula E would be merged
They will be one sport
And only electric cars would be used for this race
What do you think of this sport?
