Hello friends!
In the history of Pakistan
none of their Prime Ministers
completed the full 5year term
When Imran Khan became the Prime Minister people believed
that he would be the first Prime Minister to complete his term
But it didnt happen
Imran Khans government has now fallen
Whats the story behind it?
Its quite interesting
Come lets get to know it in todays video
Pakistans Prime Minister the former cricketer Imran Khan
has been ousted from power
after losing the vote of NoConfidence in Parliament
74 members have recorded a vote in favour of the resolution
It has been passed by a majority
of the total membership of the National Assembly
Meanwhile Imran Khan has accused the US
of conspiring to topple him over his ties with Russia and China
Lets start at the beginning
While India had the General Elections in 2019
Pakistan had their General Elections the year before in 2018
Traditionally there have been 2 main parties in India for a long time Congress and BJP
In Pakistans 2018 General Elections
two traditional parties faced off
With Nawaz Sharifs brother Shehbaz Sharif at the helm
And PPP
With Bilawal Bhutto Zardari heading it
Along with them there was a third contesting party
The name means Movement for Justice
And this party was being led by Imran Khan
Imran Khan is a famous Pakistani cricketer
he led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup
The only World Cup won by Pakistan till now
If you look at Pakistans political situation in 2018
Imran Khan was being said to be a new hope
The two traditional parties were accused of nepotism and corruption
PPPs chief Bilawal Bhutto Zardari
is the son of the former PM Benazir Bhutto
and the former President Asif Ali Zardari
And Benazir Bhutto is the daughter of the former PM Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto
On the other hand PMLN Partys image was tainted with accusations of corruption
In 2017 Nawaz Sharif was removed from the post of PM
By the Supreme Court of Pakistan
There were allegations of corruption against him after the Panama Paper leak
And there were several other corruption cases too
In July 2018 he was sentenced to 10years in jail
on the charges of purchase of upscale apartments in London
Six months later he was again sentenced to 7years imprisonment
and a fine of 25 million
because he couldnt prove how he got the ownership of a steel mill in Saudi Arabia
In the midst of such news was Imran Khan
He asked the people to vote for him
and he promised that there would be no corruption and no nepotism
For many people Imran Khan came across as the last hope for Pakistan
At the same time he had some critics too
Imran Khan is an Oxford graduate
he played international cricket
has had 3 love marriages
The first was with a British Jewish billionaires daughter
An interreligious marriage
After hearing this youd assume that hes very openminded
that hed be a secular liberal person
Not quite
Imran Khan was asked if he supports the rights of Ahmadi Muslims
he answered that he doesnt consider the Ahmadis to be Muslims
That he considers them nonMuslims
In case you dont know Ahmadi Muslims
consider Mirza Ghulam Ahmad to be a prophet
A person who doesnt believe our Prophet to be the last Prophet
he isnt a Muslim
Thats why saying that
Im being discriminatory against them
and trying to change the provisions of the Constitution
is a total lie its propaganda
And in his election campaigns he had heavily defended Pakistans blasphemy laws
Pakistans Article 295C
provides for a death penalty for those who
malign Prophet Mohammed
Imran Khan used rightwing jingoistic nationalism too
Nationalism is loving ones country
Jingoistic Nationalism is when
one starts hating other countries
Indian media uses this a lot
And in the 2018 campaigns Imran Khans party used such slogans too
Modi sympathisers are traitors
They even claimed that international establishments and India
were working together to ensure victory for Sharifs party
Its the same as when some political parties in India
accuse other political parties
as being supported by Pakistan
That theyre controlled by Pakistan
Anyway despite all of this
in the 2018 General Elections
Imran Khans party PTI was 1
They won 155 seats
4 times more than they won in the previous elections in 2013
Amazing performance
Because of corruption and nepotism
both traditional parties lost terribly
Shahbaz Sharifs PMLN won 84 seats
and on the 3rd spot was Bilawal Bhutto Zardaris PPP
With 56 seats
These details are important to understanding the current political crisis
So there are 342 seats in Pakistans National Assembly in total
So the majority mark is 172
Despite being the 1 party PTI couldnt cross the 172 mark
They had only 155 seats
Imran Khan formed a collation with some small parties and independent parties
and with their help he could get 178 seats
Doing so helped him form a government
but he was only slightly beyond the majority mark
Only 6 seats more than the majority mark
It wasnt a strong government
And so we come to the present scenario
On 8th March about a month ago
the senior leaders of the opposition parties
presented to the National Assembly
their demand for a NoConfidence vote against Imran Khan
The thing is that over the last few years
almost all opposition parties in Pakistan have joined forces
They created an alliance
called the Pakistan Democratic Movement PDM
This alliance is a catchall collation
There are no set ideologies of this alliance
It has parties of all kinds
From the left wing to the extreme right wing
Secular parties like Balochistan National Party and National Party
And parties like Jamiat UlemaeIslam and Jamiat Ahle Hadith
such religious conservative parties too
Also Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party
a party that talks about Marxism and democratic socialism
And parties like Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz
who talk about freemarket capitalism
Theyre all in it
This alliance began joint opposition rallies about 15 years ago
and raised the issues of the people
They talked about problems that Pakistan faces even today
Nawaz Sharifs daughter Mariyam Nawaz addressed the rallies
saying that Imran Khan has taken away jobs from the people
People dont even have food to last them 2 days
Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that Pakistans farmers are starving
And the youth of the country is furious
There were large crowds at these rallies
Overall inflation unemployment power cuts businesses closing down
were the issues used by the opposition against Imran Khan
And so we get to March 2021
Pakistans Finance Minister Abdul Hafiz Sheikh
contested elections for the Senate
Theres a Senate in Pakistan
it is equivalent to Indias Rajya Sabha
But there are some differences between Indias and Pakistans legislative structures
The National Assembly votes for the elections to the Senate
And Pakistans National Assembly is equivalent to Indias Lok Sabha
Abdul Hafiz Sheikh lost his Senate seat
even though Imran Khan campaigned for him
It was won by the PDM candidate
Yusuf Raza Ghilani
a former Prime Minister of Pakistan
This was a major shock to Imran Khans government
The Finance Minister of the government lost the elections
even though PM Imran Khan was campaigning for him
The opposition used this to ask Imran Khan to resign
Because Imran Khan had lost the confidence of the National Assembly
Seeing this happen Imran Khan called for a Voluntary Vote of Confidence
He asked the Parliament to vote
to see if his government should continue to be in power or not
Whether a majority of the MNAs Members of the National Assembly
support him or not
In India we refer to them as MPs Members of Parliament
While they call them MNAs Members of National Assembly
This was the second time in Pakistans history
when a Prime Minister asked for a vote of confidence in the National Assembly
In this vote Imran Khan proved his majority with 178 votes once again
It was clear that the MNAs with whom Imran Khan had formed the government
all of them still supported his government
But now one year later
The tables have turned
This time instead of Imran Khan the opposition demanded
a vote of confidence
They presented this demand on 8th March
On 10th March Islamabad Police
raided the Parliament lodges
Opposition politicians were dragged away
and arrested by the police
The opposition protested against the government because of this incident
this brutality
The way the opposition politicians were treated
Arrests have begun
The ones present in the Parliament Lodges
are being arrested
They have started arresting the JUIF workers present here
The Interior Minister of Pakistan claimed that
it was important to do so
because the members of the opposition were bringing in crowds to the Parliament
They were calling in mobs
He claimed that JUIF brought in 70 workers
while no one is allowed to have a private militia
In the midst of all this Pakistans Army
which has a large influence on Pakistans politics
I talked about this in an interview
it has been about 34 years
when I interviewed a Pakistani activist
You can watch the video I link to it in the description
Pakistans Army looked at this situation
and decided to be neutral
They didnt choose any side
This angered Imran Khan
In his speech he said
This was a big blow to Imran Khan
because it was believed that
he was in power because of Pakistans Army and ISIs support
And was keeping the opposition in check
Then on 18th March
came another blow to Imran Khan
His party members started revolting against him
PTIs rebel MNA Raja Riaz told news outlets
that about 24 politicians in PTI
were ready to leave their party
How many MNAs are with you?
Were about 2 dozen people
24? Yes sir
And theyre related to PTI? Yes theyre from PTI
Twenty four? Twenty four
It meant that without their support Imran Khans government would fall
He said that most of those politicians
were in the Sindh House in Islamabad
Raja said that he was disappointed with their Prime Minister
There was a gas shortage in his constituency
he talked to the PM about it
but nothing was done to address it
After this interview Imran Khan replied by saying that
the Sindh House where the politicians were staying at
had become a centre for horsetrading
When the news reached more people
Imran Khans supporters the PTI party workers
went to the Sindh House in a group
raised some slogans in favour of Imran Khan
and accused the rebel MNAs to have sold off their conscience
They climbed over the wall and entered the Sindh House
The next day on 19th March
Imran Khan said that the rebel politicians in his party
have agreed to stay with the party
On 20th March Imran Khan gave them an offer
if all of them went back to PTI
they would be forgiven
But on 22nd March
the rebel MNAs rejected the offer of forgiveness
On the contrary an MNA Dr Ramesh Kumar said that
the number of rebel politicians had increased
He said that there were 35 politicians who wanted to leave their party
Ramesh Kumar said that crimes against minorities are on a rise in Pakistan
Earlier on your program we said that there are 33 members today
35 members an increase of 2 members
35 members are showing their grievance with the party right now
that these are our grievances
That these are the things we discussed
but nothing has been done for the minority
Ahmed Hussain said that the Prime Minister had stopped listening to the people
Inflation is on a steep rise in the country
There are more and more difficulties for the masses
Pulses flour butter sugar the prices of all are rising
The rebel MNAs were issued Show Cause Notices by Imran Khans government
According to the Article 63A of Pakistans Constitution
the MNAs of a party arent allowed to easily defect to another party
There are many restrictions on that
But these MNAs replied that
they hadnt left the party
That they havent left PTI
and neither did they join another party
For Imran Khan the problem was that
even if the MNAs didnt defect to another party
even if they were disqualified
Imran Khan would still fall short of the majority mark
More problems ensued on 23rd March
Till then politicians of Imran Khans party were creating problems
but starting then the collation parties started creating problems too
Three collation parties started saying that
They would stop supporting Imran Khans government
The first was the PMLQ
a breakaway faction of the Pakistan Muslim League
The second MQMP
And the third was the BAP
Balochistan Awami Party
They had a total of 17 seats
So what could Imran Khan have done to save his government?
He tried to woo the collation parties
On 28th March the PMLQ leader was offered the post of Punjabs CM
The Punjab in Pakistan
The post of the Chief Minister of that state was offered to the leader of this collation
By doing so he retained PMLQs favour
MQMP was offered the Ministry of Ports and Shipping
But on 30th March this party signed an agreement with the opposition
Imran Khan replied to this by saying that
he plays till the last ball
That he would fight till the last ball to save his government
After this point in time Imran Khan
starting building conspiracy theories about foreign involvement
He said that because he had gone to Russia
America was infuriated over his Russian visit
thats why America is trying to topple his government
In fact he claimed that all the opposition members had teamed up with America
That they have tied up with the USA to overthrow his government
The US State Department and the opposition
refuted this accusation
They claim that Imran Khan is making things up
This is something that the leaders of many countries resort to
Once theyve failed and there are no more excuses
they start blaming foreign countries
After this came 3rd April
The day the Vote of Confidence was supposed to be held in the Assembly
On this day Imran Khan didnt appear before the National Assembly
But his conspiracy theory about foreign involvement
was now taken up by his Law Minister too
The Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly
was from his party
He said that because there is foreign involvement
there cannot be a NoConfidence vote based on that
He invoked Article 5 of Pakistans Constitution
It states that a NoConfidence vote is illegal
if theres an involvement of foreign powers
There was no solid evidence supporting it
2 days later it was reported that
on that day the Speaker of the Assembly wasnt present
And it was said by the Deputy Speaker
And the Speaker wasnt present because he wasnt in favour of the Article 5 ruling
After this ruling Imran Khan advised the President of Pakistan Arif Alvi
to dissolve the entire Assembly
and conduct fresh elections in Pakistan
And their President did so
Because the President is like a rubber stamp
he doesnt have many powers
Till this point in the story you would feel that
it was a happy ending for Imran Khan
That he saved his government by calling for fresh elections
But seeing this happen
the Cheif Justice of Pakistans Supreme Court
took suo moto cognizance of this matter
meaning he brought this matter to the Supreme Court
Supreme Court didnt prolong the proceeding
Neither was the Supreme Court cowed by the government
Rather Pakistans Supreme Court showed brilliant independence of the Judiciary
On 7th April a fivejudge bench of the Supreme Court
passed a unanimous verdict
They said that the actions of Imran Khans government
were unconstitutional
They could not dismiss the NoConfidence Vote with such tactics
The fresh elections being called for
was declared null and void by them
And the demand of the opposition parties for a Vote of Confidence
was held valid and given permission to be held
Then came 9th April
The day of the Vote of Confidence
As expected Imran Khans government lost this vote
The majority mark was 172
and the opposition won 174 votes
An interesting fact here
Imran Khan actually became the first Prime Minister in Pakistan
to be ousted by a NoConfidence Vote
Strictly speaking if a Prime Minister needs to be removed before the end of the term
constitutionally this is the only way to do so
So in a way this political crisis in Pakistan
is good news for Pakistans democracy
Supreme Court acted independently
There was no interference from the army
And the Prime Minister was removed constitutionally
Its said that Shehbaz Sharif can be the next Prime Minister of Pakistan
I talked about him at the beginning of the video
Overall this situation isnt terribly bad for Imran Khan yet
Its true that he has been removed from the post
but Pakistans General Elections is only a year and a half away
Imran Khan wanted the Assembly to be dissolved now
and fresh elections to be called
Because he believes that the people still support him
And if this is true
there will be elections in 115 years
Imran Khan can wait for 15 years
If Pakistans people really support him
he will win the next elections
By not accepting the NoConfidence Vote Imran Khan
is ruining his image
Here Im reminded of former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
He lost the Vote of Confidence in 1999 by 1 vote
With only 1 vote his government was overthrown
But he didnt use any conspiracy of foreign involvement
he gracefully accepted this decision
and he stepped down from the position of the Prime Minister
Months later when the elections were held again
he was back in power
with a stable majority
Thats why I believe that Imran Khan should accept the result
And respect Pakistans Constitution
Why is it that some countries are successful at protecting democracy?
While others fail
