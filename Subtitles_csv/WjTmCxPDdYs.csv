How much money did you pay there? I gave 50000 rupees Sir  50000 rupees! Yes Sir
Rahul Manan is only concerned about his money okay  I have understood this after purchasing his course
What happened I watched the entire course till the end and everything is implemented from A to Z still failed
When I went to watch his course the comment section there was also filled with abuses
There was no place left Weather its YouTube Google Twitter Instagram Facebook Comments
Where people are not feeling cheated by buying this course
That we paid this money  and there is no value in that course
Earlier too there have been complaints  about these fake gurus
That they sell courses in the name of money making
Amit Parekh Rahul Manan Dev Gadhvi and now Vivek Bindra
Where Sandeep Maheshwari jis video people complained that they were sold a course and there was no value in it
The amazing thing is that  this is spread across the world
But in India it is the highest
You know the net worth of elearning and online courses was 190 billion dollars in 2018
And now it is estimated that by 2029  it will be 319 billion dollars
Amazing thing is that 32 of the websites  on Google are selling only online courses
Every sixthseventh video on YouTube  is promoting only make money online courses
amazing thing is that in India People are becoming rich by telling them how to become rich
Are these the courses of money making gurus
Or 10 day MBA  courses to make you a businessman?
Is this course fake?  Is it a lie?
No this is not fake or lie
But this is a Generic course
You are getting the same knowledge the same knowledge or sometimes even better for free on the internet on YouTube
Without telling you this  they are giving it to you in the name of the course
Then how does a person with normal IQ buy this course?
How does one get stuck?
How they manipulate?
The most amazing thing comes in this  similar to what astrologers
First one is the Thirst Trap
Which means that a person is already hungry  to become rich
They target a common problem of humans  and trigger it a little
Like Lets say youre stuck in a 9 to 5 job
But you cant buy a car
Being in a Job Im sure Its Going to Be Very Hard for You to Make a Lot of Money Which Can Help You to Drive the Car Like This
Or you want to earn money sitting  there is no need to work
Or you want to become rich like me
Because Gen Z feels that one day they will definitely become rich
Or the biggest Amazing thing  that they say that I was very poor I had nothing
Now I have lakhs of rupees
Meaning the financial conditions of the house were very bad to spend and as you can see now 12 Pro Max is kept
Hearing this anyone thinks man  he was poor and became so rich
Everyone wants to become rich and from here
And from here that small holding awakens in their mind
Where little by little they start taking interest in it
And Seconds here they trap  Booby Trap
Which they show as show of life style
Here they show that I have this car this is a sports car I keep roaming around I have a bungalow
This live traveling the world I am in Dubai right now living in the five stars seven stars
They also show a fake account that I have so much balance in my account I go in a private jet
Malaysian influencer took a jet on rent  to show off how much money I make
Similarly expensive clothes  expensive purses
Create a confirmation bias around you
That yes this man is earning
Then they use such words to sell their course
10 day MBA financial independent or big words of strange things
That he has acquired amazing knowledge
Create very impressive ads
Only shows wealth
Like iPhone company does  like the company of Rolex does
They show their product only with a rich look  that it is not for the poor
If you are poor and want to be like us
Then they create such an ad what a lifestyle
That ad is run everywhere
On Facebook YouTube Instagram
Where they give you a catchy line  and make you click on the learn more option
Below if you want to become rich  you were poor like me click on Learn More
Here your convincing mode starts on
But here your cognitive thinking is working now
Where you know that it can be fake
They want to sell their course  just want to earn money from us
But this guru also knows this
To break your cognitive thinking  they use a word Free
Where they say that we are offering a free session
I have created an absolutely free training for you
By attending a free training you too can earn Rs 7 to 10 thousand per day within the next 30 days
I am giving a free webinar or we are giving the registration for free for 10 days for 15 days
It will not be free after that
They cash the free word in such a way that
Your cognitive thinking gets broken
You think that it is being given for free  so whats the problem
Right?  Whats the problem with going and seeing?
So the earlier traps worked
Here you register for their webinar
That you are getting it for free  there is no problem in Free
And my dear Nothing is available for free in this world
If something is being sold to you for free
Then by making a product you will be sold
Third after registering  you reached their free webinar
The main purpose of calling here is
That the ad you were seeing was very short  30 seconds 1 minute long
Where it was not possible to convince
Now they will keep you here for one or one and a half hour
And will create an echo chamber for you  will create a bandwagon effect
Where all the psychology was used to convince you
And here they will tell first of all
How have I earned what I have earned?
I have written a book  these are the proofs of my account
What he told in the video  he will explains in detail
This is my car this is my net worth  earlier I used to live there earlier I was poor
And to prove this many popular faces  will also be brought before you
Which are obviously paid
Where paid TEDx interviews will also be shown  their sessions will be shown
You will get podcasts and videos  with popular young people
By including everyone such an echo chamber  has been created in front of you
You will feel that this cannot be a lie
5040 of them are convinced to buy the course from there that we should buy
If they are not then they then target individual people
In the fourth step  where India comes
Most of the people in India buy these courses
Convince their parents or tell the parents that your son is poor his life will become better
Or convince that son
Why do these people become convinced in India?
Because two things are special in India
That it has the highest population in the world
Secondly the education rate here  the children of tier 2 and tier 3 are around 12 pass
And they are not getting jobs but they Want to become rich
And thirdly here is the US education system
Which only prepares you for job not for business
In such a situation everyone runs in the same race
So not everyone gets a job only one or two get it
In such a situation unemployment is very high here  the numbers are very high
It is very easy to manipulate such people
They create their courses on trending topics
Most of the people buy their courses
Now after purchasing the course people realize
That there was no value in it
The things mentioned in it are not lies  they are not wrong
But it is not even worth the amount given
If you learn that course  you will feel that I am not learning anything special
What you are claiming  what this course claims does not hold true at all
I would not recommend even a single person  who is watching this video to buy this course
In fact the guy is not even getting extra support
That give us some support to make us understand this no?
Now they say that the more hard you work  the more money you will earn you will have to work hard
And people feel that  We are not the only ones earning from this course
Because 1 or 2 people are earning
I dont know whether they are earning or not  they just do advertisements
So the person feels that maybe  I am not able to work that hard
But no one raises questions on the course
That there could be a problem in the course
Now tell me that if 100 pots have been planted  by some gardener
And one or two pots bloomed and 98 pots died
Then it would be the gardeners fault right?
The gardener blames the plants for not working hard  these two had also blossomed
Now those who have bought the course get selfblaming
And they dont say anything  or there are some who do not know where to speak
There are children of class 1012  where should they go?
Here they raise the same question that we are not earning from the course
Then they say no problem  those who are not earning from this 3000 course
We have another upgraded version on top of this  that is for  10000
You buy that it will make you money
Then people think maybe I will learn from there
So he buys a course worth Rs 10 thousand  but he doesnt know from there
So I thought I have come this far so lets try this course once and see if I can get success
Then they say buy it for 30 buy it for lakhs
Some people buy some people run away  some people leave
In the end there is a very good solution left for them
That if you do not learn business from our business course MBA course
Then do one thing this course we have created
You sell it to people we will give you commission
The money you paid for the course will be recovered to you
If you come here you will definitely learn the business
And you know what happens at the place of business
They do it so that their product gets sold
Sell their products nothing else is happening
You are saying that you took that course after taking which you realized that there was no point in it but
Now they told you that now sell the course further  you will get so much money
You will get this much money
And for that also they give training  that you go in front of the school and tell the children
You go to their parents tell them
How to sell their course  they also give separate training for this
And it starts like an MLM business
So if you want to recover your money?
Weve fooled you so if you want your money back?
So you fool people too
Only then you can get money
And this loop keeps on going on and on
There is no legal complaint about it
Because the children of 10th12th do not even know  how to make a legal complaint
Legal complaint cannot be made properly
Because what is mentioned in the course
There is nothing false  nothing wrong in that course
But it is generic and there is no refund policy
Whereas a legal complaint can be made
Well that will be done as a group  and with time it has happened and will also happen
But let me tell you one thing clear
Any number of courses on YouTube
Like how to grow a YouTube channel?
I provide Indias number 1 course on YouTube  I say this out of fear
Or How to become a businessman?  Or how to earn money?
Or whatever type of training courses are given
I am guaranteed that all of them are available for free on the internet and on YouTube
You dont have to pay money to anyone to get any course any knowledge
You will find it if you search properly
Wherever this course is being sold  it will be a generic course
Snd there is no value in it
And the amazing thing is that all the top businessmen
They didnt even do any courses or degrees
Steve Jobs did not do any course degree
Zuckerberg Bill Gates Richard Bedson or Henry Ford
And there are an infinite number  who never did a course or degree
And the irony its amazing
That people are earning money by telling  how to earn money wow!
If you are going to buy any kind of course on YouTube
Leave aside lakh thousand 500
Even if you are buying a course worth Rs 50 right?
Aa Thu
