Now I am become death
the destroyer of worlds
Hello friends!
16th July 1945
around 530 in the morning
In the desert of Americas state New Mexico
a bomb explodes
But this is not a normal bomb explosion
This was the first time
a nuclear bomb was being tested
This nuclear test was codenamed Trinity
and the project was led by
scientist J Robert Oppenheimer
Oppenheimer was shocked to see this bomb blast
He had expected the size of the explosion to be
around 03 kilotons of TNT
But in reality this blast was 50 times more dangerous
1520 kilotons of TNT
The blast released so much heat
that a steel tower evaporated
The shockwave was felt from a distance of 160 km
The mushroom cloud that erupted went up to 12 km in the sky
Upon seeing all this Oppenheimer was so shocked that
he uttered a line from the Bhagavad Gita
Now I am become death
the destroyer of worlds
Now I am become death
the destroyer of worlds
You might be asking how did Oppenheimer know about Bhagavad Gita?
We will talk about that later in the video
Since Christopher Nolan made a new film
So I thought this would be the right opportunity to make a video on him
What was his story?
How did he develop the nuclear bomb?
Was Oppenheimer a hero or a villain?
And how did he feel
when millions of people lost their lives because of his creation?
Lets find out in todays video
Julius Robert Oppenheimer
is known as the father of the atomic bomb
He was the director of the Manhattan Project
that created the first nuclear weapons
Lets start this story from his childhood
He was born in 1904
to a German Jewish family in New York City
And he was considered a child genius since childhood
He was studying highlevel physics and chemistry at the age of only 10
And he was very knowledgeable about mineralogy
About property of minerals
He was so knowledgeable that at the age of 12
he was invited to give a lecture at New Yorks Mineralogical Club
Later in 1922
when he went to Harvard to study
he completed his 4year degree in 3 years
He was at the top of his class
He majored in chemistry
and he was knowledgeable about many subjects
Physics philosophy literature
and even Eastern religion
But in Harvard he realized that among all these subjects
his real passion was physics
Later in 1927 at the age of 23
he did his PhD
But there was a dark side hidden behind this genius
His friends said that Oppenheimer had selfdestructive tendencies
He was a chain smoker
and was suffering through depression
One day he told his brother
I need physics more than friends
He was focused only on his studies
and remained unaware of what was happening in the world around him
Until the early 1930s
when Adolf Hitler rose in Germany
He gradually became more politically aware
Because of Hitlers tyranny
many German scientists were fleeing from Germany to America
There were many big names on this list
Like Albert Einstein
John von Neumann
who pioneered modern computers
Leo Szilard
who will play an important role in our story
Hans Bethe
who discovered fusion in stars
Edward Teller
who is called the father of the hydrogen bomb
And Enrico Fermi
who will play another important role in our story
All these scientists mainly were GermanJewish
and because Oppenheimer himself came from a GermanJewish family
when he started paying attention to the atrocities on Jews
his interest in politics started developing
This is his quote from 1936
I started to understand how deeply political  and economic events affect peoples lives
I felt the need to participate in this community
Influenced by the leftwing ideology
he went to many political meetings
And donated money to many labour unions and striking farm workers
In September 1939
Hitler invaded Poland
which was the beginning of World War 2
As I explained in my video on World War 2
America was not interested
in getting involved in this war
But still America was preparing for the worst
Actually what happened was that
a month before the war started
in August 1939
Albert Einstein and Leo Szilard wrote a letter
to American President Franklin D Roosevelt
In this letter they warned the American President
that Hitler is working on nuclear weapons
And that he may be successful in making this extremely powerful bomb
Thats why America should be prepared
As soon as he read this letter the American President
set up an advisory committee on uranium
Taking immediately action
A team of scientists and military officials was formed
Their job was to research the potential of uranium
Can uranium be made into a weapon?
After the findings of this committee
the American government started funding Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard
For researching how nuclear chain reactions work
And how to separate the isotopes of uranium
The thing is that the naturally found uranium on earth
is the uranium238 isotope
Less than 1 of the uranium is actually a U235 isotope
And only this U235 isotope
could be used to make the bomb
The first challenge for these scientists
was to find a way to make uranium235
using the uranium238
But the scientists working on this project
were told not to tell Albert Einstein anything
Because the American government was afraid
that Albert Einsteins ideology was very leftwing
It could have been a potential security risk
As you know Albert Einstein was one of those people
who used to sleep for 10 hours a night
He knew the importance of sleep
and he used to take strategic naps in the day
Compare this to todays social media motivational gurus
who tell you that you should not waste time sleeping
They tell fraud stories of how the successful people
sleep only for 56 hours a night
All lies
The truth is that regular and sufficient sleep
is very important for every human being
Apart from a few exceptions
every human being needs to sleep for 79 hours
to be at the top of their health

Now lets come back to the topic
Oppenheimer was doing his independent research
on nuclear fission with Edward Teller and other scientists
December 1940
Apart from the Uranium235 isotope
another radioactive element was discovered
which scientists believe
could also be used to make nuclear weapons
The name of this element was Plutonium
On 11th October 1941
American President sends a message to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill
saying that both countries should collaborate
for atomic development
Not even 2 months later
that on 7th December 1941
Japan attacked Pearl Harbor
and America officially entered World War 2
A state of war
has existed between
the United States and the Japanese Empire
American President Roosevelt announced that
America will become a part of the Allied powers
who were fighting against Germany and Japan
If you want to know the whole story of World War 2
I have made two videos on it
Part 1 and part 2
and detailed everything from start to end
If you havent seen it I will put the link in the description
you can watch them after this video
But at this point in time it becomes clear that
the scientific mission of developing nuclear weapons
had turned into a military mission
America spent 22 billion
on this one project
Taking inflation into account it is equivalent to 24 billion today
Almost 2 trillion Indian rupees
The American military had an engineering wing
the Army Corps of Engineers
It made ports and airfields for the army
Its involvement was approved by President Roosevelt
in June 1942
Now the office of the North Atlantic Division was in Manhattan New York City
And when they got the responsibility to make nuclear weapons
they made their headquarters in the same building on the 18th floor
These headquarters were named Manhattan Engineer District
and from this point in time
the Manhattan Project officially started
The date was 13th August 1942
Next month on 17th September
Colonel Leslie Richard Groves
was appointed as the head of the project
And he made the decision to
appoint Oppenheimer as the leader of the design of the atomic bomb
A secret location was decided to keep this project under cover
Oak Ridge Tennessee
This city is also called the Secret City
because an entire city was built here
only for this project
Thousands of scientists researchers and workers
were moved to this city
and they had only one task
Creating Uranium235 from Uranium238
I will not go into the details of the science of nuclear fission
because I explained it in the video on Chernobyl
You can watch that video if you want to understand it in detail
The point is that Uranium238
is not very fissionable
It cannot undergo a chain reaction
to make a bomb
It was very important to extract Uranium235
Only Uranium235 can undergo a chain reaction
which is why it was required
The plan was to try out 4 different methods
to make U235 from U238
Gaseous diffusion
electromagnetic separation
and liquid thermal diffusion
After testing these 4 different technologies
2 technologies proved to be successful to some extent
Electromagnetic separation and gaseous diffusion
In electromagnetic separation
a large magnet is used to separate U235 from U238
In gaseous diffusion
Uraniumhexafluoride gas
is passed through a porous membrane
in which the light molecules of U235
pass successfully
But since the U238 molecules are heavier
and they get filtered out
Apart from this at a different location in Washington
scientists were at work producing Plutonium as well
Plutonium is also produced from Uranium 238
When an isotope of hydrogen
is bombarded with Uranium 238
then plutonium is produced
Later it was found that plutonium
is more radioactive and more fissionable
as compared to Uranium 235
Apart from these two locations
they were looking for a third location
For Project Y
A location where the actual work of
designing and making these bombs would take place
General Groves wanted a remote location for this
So that the project could remain a secret
Oppenheimer knew exactly such a location
It is a place where Oppenheimer spent his summers happily
Surrounded by mountains and beautiful landscapes
the Pecos Valley in New Mexico
After setting up all these locations
there was only one obvious thing left to do
To practically test out a chain reaction
Everything was theoretical till now
So they needed proof on whether
the whole concept of the atomic bomb
was feasible or not
2nd December 1942
Scientist Enrico Fermi conducted the first successful practical experiment
In a squash court of the University of Chicago
he ran a chain reaction
which helps light up a bulb
The clicketyclack of their instruments
proved they had achieved
the first humanmade nuclear chain reaction
By this point General Groves
was impressed with Oppenheimers ability
He wanted to appoint him as the director of Project Y
But some senior members of the military
doubted Oppenheimer
The same way that they doubted Albert Einstein
Many friends of Oppenheimer
his wife and in fact his brother
were all hardcore communists
He was influenced by the leftwing ideology himself
America was afraid that this communist ideology
could go against their country
But despite these concerns
General Groves personally supported Oppenheimer
and said that
this project could not happen without Oppenheimer
And that he was essential for this project
And because of this on 20th July 1943
Oppenheimer was made the lead of this project
To make an atom bomb
Oppenheimers expertise was required
in the calculation of critical mass
Critical mass is basically a minimum amount of mass
of Uranium235 or Plutonium
which is needed to have a chain reaction
to sustain a chain reaction
The minimum amount of radioactive elements that would be needed
to carry out a chain reaction and a bomb blast
It seems easy today
but there were many unknown factors at that time
We hardly knew anything about the properties of Uranium235
Plutonium239 was actually discovered in 1940
And by the end of 1943
only 2 milligrams of plutonium could be produced
Thats why America was developing two atom bombs
The first bomb was based on Uranium235
named Little Boy
The mechanism of this bomb was basically
a guntype design
Two masses of Uranium235 were taken
which were subcritical
Less than the critical value
And they were combined rapidly with each other
With this combination the critical mass was reached
and a fission chain reaction follows
resulting in an explosion
The second bomb was the plutonium bomb
which was using plutonium239
and its name was Fat Man
It was more difficult to design
Here it could not be designed as a gun
because if the masses of two plutonium were combined
it would react very quickly
and the fission reaction would end before the critical mass could be reached
A Plutonium gunbomb would melt not explode
Here scientists created a different design for the plutonium bomb
The mass of plutonium was to be placed under high pressure and density
in a spherical structure
A subcritical mass of plutonium was placed inside a hollow sphere
And outside the sphere explosives were used
to create an implosion in the mass of plutonium
When the explosives outside exploded
the plutonium would be under high pressure
and it would reach the critical mass
This concept was called the implosion method
Scientists already knew about the gun method
but this was the first time that the implosion method was theoretically mentioned
Oppenheimer believed that it was necessary to test it out
before actually putting it in the bomb
General Groves said that
they cant test such things because
they had produced only a small amount of plutonium
But Oppenheimer was adamant that
the test was necessary
So General Groves had to finally agree
And then friends the Trinity Test was conducted
I talked about this at the beginning of the video
In the desert of New Mexico
a test nuclear bomb was dropped
This test bomb was called Gadget
It contained 13 pounds of plutonium
Scientists hung Gadget 100 ft in the air using a steel tower
And on 16th July 1945
at 530 am
this bomb was detonated
As I told you
this bomb was much more powerful than Oppenheimer expected
The steel tower completely evaporated
After the bomb blast a mildly radioactive greencoloured glass was formed
which was named Trinitite
It was after seeing this blast
that Oppenheimer uttered some lines of the Bhagavad Gita
Now I am become death
the destroyer of worlds
I suppose we all thought that
one way or another
Actually Oppenheimer was a Sanskrit scholar
and he had studied the entire Bhagavad Gita
in its original form
He describes the Bhagavad Gita as one of the most influential books of his life
Less than a month after the Trinity test
on 6th August 1945
the Little Boy bomb was dropped on Hiroshima
If that wasnt enough
then three days later this plutonium Fat Man bomb
was dropped on Nagasaki too
What was the effect of dropping these atomic bombs?
I have discussed this in detail in the Hiroshima and Nagasaki video
Albert Einsteins first reaction
upon hearing this news was
Woe is me
A melancholy statement
It is believed that Albert Einstein also said this
Mankind invented the atomic bomb
but no mouse would ever construct a mousetrap
Oppenheimer expressed happiness after the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima
He wished that this bomb
could be used against Nazi Germany and Hitler
But when the bomb was dropped on Nagasaki
Oppenheimer was shocked
On 17th August he went to Washington
to meet the Secretary of War
To handdeliver the letter he wrote
He directly said that
he wanted to ban nuclear weapons
He was very regretful
about his part in it
The technology he handed over to humas
Oppenheimer considered the first bomb dropped on Hiroshima as a necessary evil
But now he was afraid for the future
What will different countries do with this technology in the future?
In the meantime in April 1945
American President Roosevelt passed away
The next American President was Harry Truman
Two months after the bomb was dropped on Nagasaki
Oppenheimer got a chance
to meet President Truman
When meeting the President he said directly
I have blood on my hands
And President Truman was so angry after hearing this that
he started shouting at him
He told his secretary to throw Oppenheimer out of the office
and that he didnt want to see his face ever again
Oppenheimer later worked with the US Atomic Energy Commission
to stop other such nuclear attacks
He wanted to establish control over nuclear weapons
In 1949 when President Truman approached the commission
with the idea of making a hydrogen bomb
Oppenheimer strongly opposed it
But this opposition was of no use
because America developed a hydrogen bomb later
and also conducted tests in 1952
Edward Teller was the scientist
who helped in making this hydrogen bomb
And he is called the Father of the Hydrogen Bomb today
Because of Oppenheimers resistance
and his leftwing ideology
his job was snatched away from him
He spent the rest of his life in the academic profession
and used to give lectures all over the world
Even though he was nominated for the Nobel Prize thrice
he could not win even once
In 1965 due to throat cancer
Oppenheimer died at the age of 62
Which was not surprising
as he was a terrible chain smoker throughout his life
Today there are 9 countries
that have nuclear weapons
India Pakistan China
the USA France the UK
Israel Russia and North Korea
But the positive thing is that in the last 80 years
no other nuclear weapon has been used
If you liked the video you can learn the whole story of Chernobyl
in this video by clicking here
You will be able to understand a little more about nuclear reactions
See you in the next video
Thank you very much!
