This is a 100 million megamansion and its possibly
the most luxurious house ever built by mankind
And were going to be comparing living in this house
to living in this 69 million art house
thats built to withstand a literal tsunami
a 30 million palace with its very own waterpark
and everything in between all the way down
to this 1 barely functioning house
More of a shed
Well its only a dollar
Why does this house cost a dollar?
Yeah we get another storm its probably going to go into the water
So its worth a dollar for me just to get rid of it
So you would say this is a horrible investment for me?
Yes indeed  Lets do it
Lets go
This is sketchy
What are the odds I fall through?
Pretty high
Bro these are wobbly
I like how that chair is just like holding on for dear life
We have a recliner a mattress and half a floor
I can literally fish from inside of the house
Yo I caught one
Thats just the lure Im sorry
Now that you see us having fun do you regret selling it?
I do not
What if I gave you 2 to buy back off me?
No  Alright I tried
I have an idea
Lets get out of this house
Later in this video
we have a house that cost 100 million times more than this
And because I never plan on setting foot in this worthless shack again
Lets head over to something a little nicer
Speaking of which were at the million dollar house
which technically means you need to be a millionaire to buy this house
Lets show you how a millionaire lives
My first impression is its way bigger than my house
When you pay 1000000 you get a pretty good sized kitchen
along with four bedrooms that look normal
But they keep going
because this bedroom has a closet here which leads into a bathroom
thats bigger than the 1 house
The bathtub is gigantic
Im six foot five and I can fit in this perfectly comfortable
And even though the bathrooms are all stocked with bidets
Oh God!
The best seat in the house is definitely downstairs
Oh snap! They have a movie theater
Dude these chairs are massage chairs
Wait what?
These chairs each have two remotes
Two remotes!
On top of the movie theater theres also an arcade
I was not expecting all these features for 1 million
This house is awesome
Id have so much more friends
If I owned a place like this
and ending with the pool which comes complete
with this unnecessary waterfall
Overall Id say this is a pretty fun house to live in
But of course were all here to see the richest of the rich
And thats why up next we have these 15 million
15 million house
Wait you pushed it?
Oh my God
Jeez man
I dont belong here
This looks like the house that you tried to get to in GTA
That view is crazy
The pool is much smaller than the 1 million house
but you can literally oversee all of LA
Hey! Help!
Stop Stop
Go inside
I need new friends
Lets check out the house The person who owns this house
What do you think he does for a living?
Hes a lawyer
This guy was the top attorney in 2017 and the number one lawyer in 2021
Apparently thats all it takes to afford this house
It appears a note was left for us
Dear MrBeast thank you for visiting my home
You have given me the ultimate gift
I have a trump card with my kids forever
Also please dont eat any of the sandwiches
They are very sacred to me
and my familys been passing it down from generation to generation
Got it
Down or up?  Down
Down it is
Okay now its starting to look nice
The lower floor of this mansion
comes with its very own movie theater and personal gym
This treadmill requires a passcode to use
Six nine six nine
Its not six nine six nine
A guest bedroom an entertainment area and a bar where the owner left us
a bunch of free food
Guys before you eat anything  Yeah
What if he left this out  so he could sue us for eating his
Well too late now Karl ate it
And an incredible underground view of the swimming pool
Nolans trying to swim in the background for the shot
I dont think he realized we stopped filming him
Back again?
Yeah do it one more time
And now a master bedroom with another crazy view
Karl come here
You missed
We got another one
You missed again
Oh wait! Nolan stop it!
Nolan stop this cushion also
Stop throwing cushions
If it goes over the edge he might sue me
And so to avoid being handed court papers we decided to fly all the way
across the country to Massachusetts for the 30 million dollar house
This extraordinary 16 bedroom estate has four different buildings
In the main house
There are multiple living rooms but this one is the best
of the living rooms in this property
This is grand
What is this?  The Oval Office
What book would you expect here
besides The Way To Wealth by Benjamin Franklin
Bro made the light bulb and a book?
Well Edison made the light bulb Not Ben Franklin
What the hell did Ben Franklin do?
Im going to read this book
Past the living room in the office
was the Grand Kitchen where the owner had left a little gift for us
The owner of this place got rich making candles
So he made us custom MrBeast candles
That one smells like the beach
It does
How do they put the beach in a candle?
And to top off the houses main building
Chandler discovered that
You can hit golf balls off the roof
Thats not even close to the coolest thing about this place
because next door is a garage filled with exotic cars
This looks like a garage out of a video game
They got Lamborghinis on top of Lamborghinis
Its like a candy store for adults
The best part is this is just one of two car garages
Follow me  Theres more?
Bro theres more cars in here than the other one
Holy crap!
All right now I am convinced if we steal a car he would not notice
How do you even buy these cars? Hey I want three of the same ones
Its like a full time job to buy this many cars
Theres stairs in the corner Lets see where they go
Bro this is like a closet with cars
Underneath the car garage is another army of cars
They should really invest in a light switch down here
They have 20 cars down here but no lights
Did I?  No way!
No way!
Thats why there wasnt a light switch
I was like who can afford to shove 30 cars
in their basement but not electricity?
Now dont get me wrong all of the rooms
in this house have been awesome so far
But if I owned it I dont think Id ever leave this next building
This is awesome
Thats right
For some just ungodly reason whoever built this place thought
it would be a good idea to install an entire indoor tennis court
I just want to remind you that we are playing tennis inside a house
I also have no idea how to play tennis
Gang squad follow me
What? No way!
Two story arcade
The arcade in this house
is actually 20 times bigger than the one at the 1 million house
But thats not all
Bro this place literally has everything
All right Im never leaving
Were playing ping pong in a basketball court in a house
First try baby!
Now all of the features of the 30 million house have been pretty cool
But this next room is what makes this place truly special
Head up these stairs for the best part of the estate
What you really want to see is right over here look at this
This is an indoor waterpark
Its like a whole new world in here
Look how far back the drone is and its still going
Go have fun but dont break anything
Roger that
Were all about to go down the slide together
Were going to enjoy the waterpark
Ill see you at the next house
The only bad news is its once again across the entire country
The good news is its a 45 million megamansion
What!  Oh my gosh
This is like the most open house Ive ever been in
I dont know what majestic thing this is but its beautiful
As you can probably tell
these houses are starting to get so expensive
I dont even know how to describe them anymore
Honestly lost for words
This is quite possibly the most beautiful thing Ive ever seen
So I called in multibillionaire Mark Cuban to help us out
Hows it going?  Hey!
Hows it going little man?  Nice to meet you
Marks also the proud owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team
And because this house has its very own basketball court
you can imagine we got a little distracted
Jimmy wont make it!  Buckets!
Just steal it from Karl
Hit that
No shot  We get those
Yeah thats it
Go go go go go Easy lay bud
There we go Jakes play wins All you Hit it Game winner
Oh no
Way to dominate Jakers
Now were going to show Mark around the rest of the house
Now that were all sweating
To find out if he thought it was worth the steep 45 million price
In case youre wondering we didnt go swimming
It looks like I did go swimming
How much do they want for this house?  45
Not worth it?  Because its Brentwood
Thats probably half of it
Is Brentwood what that is?
No the neighborhood
I also thought he was talking about the wood in the house
Thats funny
This bathroom over here its nice
Do you have a couch in your bathroom?
Yes  Oh really?
Okay We need to get on Marks level
The number one rule is you have to have a heated seat
Thats it?
That feeling when you sit down  And it is not cold?
I agree
You dont need to make billions to be happy
You just need to be able to afford a bidet and a heated toilet seat
Cause thats where I spend most of my time
Well even though Im sure Mark would love to spend more time
here on the toilets our time here is officially ran out
And so Ill see you guys at the next house
Up next we have a house whose price point happens
to be my favorite number
And now we are at the 69 million mansion
That looks like a villain owns it
It does look villainous
Hows this compare to your house Miranda?
Its a lot bigger than mine
That cant be sure Whats your address?
The reason why this weird looking house can still go on the market
for 69 million is because its filled to the brim
with priceless art and sculptures sourced from all around the world
Throw up how much these artworks are worth
and were going to try to guess it How much do you think this is worth?
Im going to say 100000
What do you think Miranda?  Im going to go with 80
Oh she has one of these in her house
Yeah I have the same one
Only you know the actual price
Oh actually this one will be a fun one
Im going to go with 1000000 because its like right down
the opening stairs so
Very precise  Very specific
The 30 million house
had a waterpark a hundred cars
This place just has artwork
Big red sculpture
This room over here we promised them 30 times
we wouldnt touch whats in it
Come over here
No touching anything what is it?
This is a one of one fully analog custom home sound system
made by the creator of the Walkman which was one of the first devices
that allowed you to listen to music while walking
Thats an impressive thing to have under your belt
To have made the Walkman
I dont think you could fit this under your belt
Lets traverse across the skywalk
Oh my God Im excited
Another reason this house is built so strange
For example having to walk across SkyBridge is to get anywhere
is because its been meticulously built
to be able to withstand the force of a real tsunami
I mean you got to admit thats pretty cool
You can see the tsunamis before they hit your house and you stop them
What completes the view is the neighbors backyard
You can see all of it
What if the man who lives here is secretly in love
with the person that lives next door?
Thats his ex girlfriend
Its a Romeo and Juliet
And after checking out the last two rooms inside
I had a surprise waiting for us outside
Look over there
Deez nuts
Did you guys even notice the planes drawing that?
How on earth did they do that?
I paid these planes and also about a thousand billboards
all across America to let everyone know
that Feastables is the best tasting chocolate you can buy
Stop eating Hersheys and other boomer brands Feastables is modern chocolate
Also because halloween is coming up in all these retailers
you see here were now
selling these bags of these smaller pieces bars
so you can give them out during trick or treating
If you dont want to be lame on Halloween
make sure you give away Feastables to trickortreaters
Luckily our candy is pretty affordable
but you know whats not so affordable?
The final house or should I say
the 139 million
arguably most luxurious house on the planet MegaMansion
This massive
36000 square foot mansion has things you never see in any other house
from a nightclub to a TRex to an entire robotic car elevator
This place is going to blow your mind and to make this house tour
extra special we brought Justin Timberlake
How you guys doing?
And this is Justins house and hes going to show us around
Holy crap!
Have you ever seen a view better than this in your life?
This is gorgeous  Yeah man you guys really
The CGI is perfect it looks real
Hes like Yeah maybe its top 10
Ill put it top five
Its hard to describe just how big this mansion really is
It has 12 bedrooms and 17 bathrooms split across three massive
stories all with a perfect view of the Los Angeles skyline
I always judge a house by the kitchen minimalist kitchen
You judge these things How are you feeling?
Well lets keep going
At the end of the tour well get his opinion on
if he would pay 100 million
He has it on standby if he likes it
Straight cash homie
Everything in this house is built out of the most expensive materials
on the planet
For example the walls in this room are constructed entirely out of rare
marble imported straight from Italy
You guys got to get an estimate or something
on how much marble is actually in this house
I mean thats a thats like custom done
Yeah theres not a single thing of drywall in this entire house
This is a pretty sick chandelier
This chandelier is over 1000000
And the ceiling literally started dipping
because it weighs so many thousands of pounds
It really keeps going
You didnt tell me it was a million I was playing with it earlier
There is literally 6 million of just chandeliers in this house
and the rooms on the bottom floor get even better
Theres a whole other house down here
If you come over here
Dude this is literally an ice room
This is where you lock me in?  No
Please dont
So what do you do in here?
They ran out of room ideas
Probably a 50 chance were locked in here
because that doesnt have a handle
Oh no Were good
That would have been funny if we were
His face
Is that a real dinosaur?
Now that you know the house has a dinosaur are you more apt to buy it?
Im still on the fence
Is this a locker room?
No one currently owns this house
so they put nametags of the few people
on the planet that can actually afford it
Warren Buffetts worth like 80 billion Ellisons worth like 50 billion
Bezos Like 100 billion
Chandler why is your name not up here?
All right lets check out the whips
Nolan are you just posing?  Ill just be sitting here
You really match the house
Thank you
I was going for that I was going for that
Job well done
Nolans going to go in the editing room and clip that
This 25 million car elevator
is one of the most insane features in the whole house
You select which car you want to drive on the tablet
and it literally sends it up two floors right into the garage
I know what youre thinking
The main problem with this is it only stores
Six Lamborghinis and  Yeah
You needed like a ten car storage
This house also had the by far
biggest home theater Ive ever seen in my life
This almost looks like a real movie theater
This is the best movie theater so far
And theyre actually reclining chairs
It only costs 100 mil for that
Check it out Jimmy Wait press my massage button
I got you
Hey! I dont need this
Bro wheres my button? My chairs not even doing that
Here switch Let me see
Yeah Chandler test the massage feature
Oh my god it works
No way this is just the only one here
Man This is great
Bro what is wrong with them?
All right lead the way upstairs
This is a primary bedroom over here
Oh and then over here
The bathrooms
In case youve ever wanted to shower with ten people
Now you can
Thats my thing man
You can take a bath with no one
And basically all yourself but showering
You can fit an army in there
If thats what youre into  He is
And now the best part of the house over at the pool
The real reason this house cost so much
Im pressing it
Is this a screen?
It is absurdly large
And slow
It gives drama though  It is Exactly
It gives a dramatic effect
I mean
Its a little bit of a flex
What a gorgeous view of LA
Yeah Imagine this screensaver was LA
I think it is
Theres downtown LA
and theres downtown LA
For reference Karl is like six foot five
Yeah something like that Give or take
And look how tall the TV is compared to him
All right Justin youve seen the whole house
We need to know
Obviously you have 100 million in cash sitting outside
Are you going to buy the house?
Nolans shirt comes with it  You dont like my shirt?
Your shirt comes with it?  Yeah
Im in Does the bear that ripped up the shirt come with it?
Oh no!
Lets go!
Wait wait  Why?
I hope you guys enjoyed it
Ill see you around
