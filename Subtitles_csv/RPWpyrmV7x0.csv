Hey there guys its Mr Q friendly

Hey guys its Krystal on Super Saf TV
Hey guys this is Austin Evens on Super Saf
and it is dub dub DC my friends
Which is apparently like what the cool kids call it
I dont know
Whats up guys Saf here on SuperSaf TV
and weve just finished WWDC which was
crazy packed with lots and lots of stuff
Lets go and find out what the reactions
from some of my friends have been
Man that was a lot that was a lot of of a lot of
announcements in a short amount of
not even a short amount of time it was two hours
It was rapid fire like every single time like
a new screen popped up it would disappear
in like two seconds because they would have
so much information that was just happening so quickly
Dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub
Well you know dub dub is a software show
but I was always excited its always exciting
when there hardware and we got that today
I mean after how many years?
13 14 15 16 17 18 six years of waiting!?
We now have a new Mac pro so thats
pretty exciting for creators especially
Okay not gonna lie when I first saw it
it looked like a cheese grader
I was like is this a new kitchen appliance?
But the power behind the Mac Pro
is absolutely incredible
Everything man but I liked the Mac Pro of course
Like being the hardware guy thats the one that excites me
That Mac Pro mmm mmmm
And you made a little Instagram video
It was like do you think their gonna show the Mac Pro?
I was like of course not
Well they did and it is absolutely fantastic
I am so excited to spec this thing out
because I feel itll probably be like
75000 like by the time you spec that thing out
Maybe even more because if you wanna get multiple monitors
I dont even know oh my gosh
Am I gonna be doing an unboxing of
a hundred thousand dollar Mac Pro?
Has everybody been talking about the Mac Pro?
Mac Pro modularity weve been asking for this
for ages and now we have a computer
which basically we can keep for lets say 5 6 7 8 years
without worry of having to throw away and buy a new one
But like that Mac Pro looked really dope right
And what I really appreciate is that they actually
gone sort of above and beyond
to make sure this is super modulate
So its not one of those things where oh you have to buy
like the Apple adding parts all the time
Or anything like that
Obviously the offer though is a nice sort of
as a feature to have but you could
also just buy your own graphics card and throw it in
As long as you have the drivers it should work
And so I was able to take a look on the inside
The cooling seems to be solid
its got a huge power supply but
importantly you just got a bunch of PCI slots right
Put whatever you want in there
And it even seems like that zion
even though I wasnt able to actually take off heat sinc
is also fairly user upgradable
So its one of those things where its like
imagine if Apple makes a super high end desk top
with all the features of a super high end desk top
and the price of a super high end desk top
Oh my gosh theres so much stuff
like just where do we even watch OS
I mean the IOS oh gosh Im just new maps
The new maps looked actually amazing
Oh and also Siri she has new voice
The photo and video editing on IOS 13
was really cool because I feel like for me
that will replace that extra step that I do
in visco for videos at least like
Instagram videos you know like editing on there
but straight on the camera app is really cool
Think that Ive been looking forward to the most
of course is dark mode
Im a simple man I just want to save my battery life
Actually I lied my first highlight
is gonna be dark mode IOS
Thats what we wanted I feel like weve been
wanting this for the longest time and its finally here
Dark mode hello?
The dark mode like we were expecting
that more to come and its happened
Also the new watch faces of course and the new maps
So like a few things
Well obviously dark mode like its a favorite
I was waiting for it for the longest time so
I use dark mode on twitter on my Mac Book
on everything so definitely dark mode
Yo dude this is actually there was a lot of
stuff here right so its cool to see like
watch OS updates Im actually like
lowkey excited to see all the iPad stuff
Like for me the iPad Pro is so close to being a machine
which can really be like a good for almost everything
besides editing sort of thing
Like its super lightweight I love the software
I love the hardware its just nice
its actually getting some more Pro features
So Im a big fan of the iPad Pro last year
And thats really like the tablet getting
closer to the laptop and you know
Apple has tried to keep those two worlds separate
but were seeing over the last two years
Mac OS and IOS kind of merge the two worlds together
and that new iPad OS is probably a step in the
right direction Im pretty excited as an iPad Pro user
because thats really going to increase my productivity
and be able to use that tool to do more things
Oh Side Car?
The iPad is a second display and also
you can use it as a tablet which is amazing
because I love using tablets
Obviously the Mac Pro is the
one were all excited about
That stand and that monitor got my attention
The 5000 monitor with an extra 1000 stand
I dont know if a lot of people caught that
and then theres another 1000 for the matte finish
So thats an exciting display but its very pricey
But its for the pros so well see how that goes
And then theres a ton of features in Mac OS
in watch OS in IOS in iPad OS
Its all good stuff
Theres so much stuff I dont even know
This made no sense
And there we go guys highlights from
DubDub its been absolutely awesome so much stuff
For me personally dark mode something that I was
definitely looking forward to you
guys have hear me say dark mode all things
so its great that we now have that
And also sidecar being able to use your iPad Pro
with the Apple pencil that should be really cool
I know somebody who uses that Wacom bamboo tablet
so it will be nice to be able to experience that
And Mac Pro I mean that thing is a beast
I know theres going to be a lot of cheese grater jokes
but how powerful it is is pretty crazy
And thats it for this video
