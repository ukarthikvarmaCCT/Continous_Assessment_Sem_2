Hello friends!
28th June 1914
A 19yearold student at a school
assassinates the AustroHungarian Prince
And this one incident
triggered the war
A war that lasted four years
In which more than 20 million people lost their lives
A war in which several ancient empires came to an end
A war that was fought across multiple countries and continents
Today we know of this war as the World War I
Doesnt it sound very sensational?
Because of this one single event
World War I broke across the world
If we could go back to the past in a time machine
and if we could prevent this assassination
would there be no World Wars in the world?
The reality isnt this simple friends
When theres a large scale war like this
there is a long and complex chain of reasons driving it
And then theres one such incident that causes a spark
Imagine if theres a mountain of dynamites here
And I use a small matchstick to blow up the entire mountain
the following blast would not be because of my matchstick
there was a mountain of dynamite there
thats why it happened
Come in todays video
lets understand World War I
January 1916
140000 men were assembling for the attack
In the year 1914
Europe looked like this on a map
There was an Austro Hungarian empire in the middle
the empire was much bigger than the present size of the countries Austria and Hungary
Germanys empire was also much bigger than presentday Germany
Poland wasnt a country
There was the Russian Empire in Russia
There was the Ottoman Empire in presentday Turkey
Apart from these there was the United Kingdom and France
Its interesting to know friends
most of the European countries were monarchies at the time
There were rulers in those places
In fact there were only 3 European countries
that were Democracies rather than monarchies
France Switzerland and San Marino
There are some countries in Eastern Europe
such as Serbia Bosnia Romania and Bulgaria
collectively called the Balkan Countries
Dont forget them theyre very important for our story
We will begin our story from the year 1878
There was a war between the Russian empire and the Ottoman empire
Ottoman empire was on one side
and the Russian empire on the other
helping the Balkan countries separate from the Ottoman empire
At the conclusion of the war
the Treaty of Berlin was signed in 1878
According to this treaty
the Austro Hungarian empire was given the right
to administer the region of BosniaHerzegovina
But the area would officially be a part of the Ottoman empire
But in October 1908
the Austro Hungarian empire annexed BosniaHerzegovina
Invaded there
This political caricature from then is very interesting
The Ottoman Sultan with his folded hands is feeling helpless
Because of the internal problems in the Ottoman empire
There were internal revolutions
During this time Bulgaria successfully separated from the Ottoman empire
represented as the independent state in the middle
On the left you can see the Austrian emperor Franz Josef
is trying to steal BosniaHerzegovina
He is ripping it out of the map to steal it
The region of BosniaHerzegovina
was under the Ottoman empire for 400 years
but instead of getting independence
another empire came in and captured them
Obviously the people of Bosnia were enraged at this
They wanted freedom
People in the neighbouring country Serbia were also infuriated at seeing this happen
The Serbians didnt only have a geographical connection with the Bosnians
they even had an ethnic connection
Actually all the Eastern European countries
have the ethnicity of Slavs
Many people living in these countries feel this connection
In fact if you look at the bottom of the map
the countries in dark blue
the people in these countries call themselves South Slavs
Many people in these countries
even demanded a South Slavic Nation
Serbia complained that
the Austro Hungary empire
wasnt merely invading Bosnia
rather they were invading the South Slavs
Before capturing the country the foreign minister of AustriaHungary
had already spoken with the Russian foreign minister
asking Russia to refrain from objecting to it
as they were giving them prior intimation of their capture
And Russia agreed to them
Because Russia wanted something in return
Look at this map this is the Black Sea
and the Sea of Marmar is in the South
the Strait of Bosphorus joins the two
And dividing Istanbul into 2
This part belonged to the Ottoman empire
And Russia wanted to have this
So Russia told the AustroHungarian empire
that Russia would annex the region
And so they shouldnt oppose them
And Russia wouldnt say anything either when they capture Bosnia
A good deal
But there was a problem
The problem was that many Slavic people lived in Russia
And many Russians started protesting the invasion of Bosnia
How could they agree to the AustroHungarian empire
getting control of Slavic people?
The Russian empire was already weak
It had to abide by the wishes of the people
So despite the secret agreement
the Russian foreign minister
started supporting Serbia
It was 1909
the AustroHungarian empire turned towards Germany and asks them
if they capture Serbia
and Russia comes to interfere
would Germany help the AustroHungarian empire?
Germany agrees to help them as they were old friends
Theyd definitely help
On the other hand Russia asks France
AustroHungarian empire had first invaded Bosnia
and when Serbia objected to it
the AustroHungarian empire and Germany
had joined forces to attack Serbia
Russia proposed that France should join its forces with Russia to fight against them
But France replies that
it has nothing to do with Bosnia
regardless of what happened they didnt want to interfere in the matter
Frances refusal silenced Russia
And it had to accept the annexation of Bosnia
With this
the threat of a war
the threat of World War ensuing
But then comes the assassination of Ferdinand
The thing was that
the Bosnians that were annexed
the Bosnians didnt accept that meekly
The Bosnians wanted freedom
A new revolutionary movement had begun
It is named the Young Bosnia
It was a revolutionary group of students
And the Serbians were helping them
They aimed to build an independent country
In fact not only did they aim to free BosniaHerzegovina
but also to unite with Serbia
They wanted to build a United South Slavic nation
What a beautiful name Yugoslavia
Yugo means South
An apt term for a South Slavic country
Spoiler alert it did become a reality later on
Although by now the country has broken apart too
But anyway on 28th June 1914
the prince of AustroHungary Ferdinand
with his wife Sophie went to visit the annexed territory in Bosnia
They wanted to travel through the newly acquired territory
but soon that cause much suffering to them
Six Bosnian revolutionaries planned to assassinate them
Around 10 in the morning
a revolutionary named Cabrinovic
threw a bomb near Ferdinands car
But the bomb bounced on the car and blew up in a side street
Injuring 20 people
Ferdinand escaped this
The meeting he was headed to was then cancelled because of the shock
and tells the Bosnian mayor that
They decided to cancel the program and go to the hospital
To meet the injured people
On the way to the hospital
their car takes a wrong turn mistakenly
When they tried to get back to the correct route
they realised that actually
they were a mere 5 feet away from a revolutionary
A 19yearold school student
Gavrilo Princip
I talked about him at the beginning of the video
This was the person to shoot at Ferdinand and his wife Sophie
And so assassinated the prince of the AustroHungarian empire
Gavrilo Princip was arrested immediately
but he was 2 months short of 20 years
and so according to the law he couldnt be given the death sentence
Gavrilo was sentenced to 20 years in jail for this assassination
During the trial he said that
he was a Yugoslav Nationalist
That he aimed to unite the yugo slavs
But it didnt matter to him which state would Yugoslav be a part of
But during the trials he wanted that
Bosnia should be free from Austria
The emperor of the AustroHungarian empire is enraged at the assassination
In his anger
the declares war on Serbia
Russia sees this as an attempt to annex Serbia
And so Russia went to save Serbia
Germany saw that Russia was taking arms against the AustroHungarian empire
And so Germany went to save the AustroHungarian empire
This time France doesnt stay behind
France reached there in support of Russia and Serbia
This created an interesting chain
called the Chain of Friendship
This is an interesting caricature
drawn to describe the situation
Italy was in alliance with AustriaHungary and Germany
But Italy reneges on the agreement to support the two
Because the agreement stated that in case of an attack on their country
the others would help them
But it was AustriaHungary and Germany that were invading Serbia
They started the attacks
So Italy claimed that they werent bound to help
But because the Ottoman empire had enmity with Russia
the Ottoman empire reached in support of the AustroHungarian empire
The United Kingdom gets involved in this too
Because Russia France and Britain had an alliance treaty called the Triple Entente
This was how
the Great war ensued
In which all these countries were at war with each other
Later countries like the USA and Japan
join this war in support of Britain and France
And obviously the countries that were under British rule
like India
gets involved in this war
Because the British needed soldiers
And the easiest option was to
use the people of the countries Britain had colonised as soldiers
Many Indians went to participate in World War I on behalf of Britain
Friends this was how World War I began
But a pertinent question arises here
why were all these countries so eager to go on a war against each other?
If something like this happens today
so many countries wouldnt get into the war
What was so different then?
That these countries readily went to war
Friends its said that there were four main reasons for it
Friends here Nationalism means
a nationalism without liberation
A nationalism without independence
A nationalism that was based on race
On the belief that their country is the best in the world
And to have an aggressive attitude against the other countries
Looking at other countries as inferiors
Bismark had united Germany in 1871
on the basis of nationalism
But Germany was still a constitutional monarchy
Under the Prussian monarchy
The kings and emperors took advantage of this nationalism among people
They convinced people to go on a war for their country
And they declared war for Imperialism
To capture and occupy the other countries
You might think that it is so difficult to manage ones own country
why would these people want to expand the borders of their countries?
Why did they want to invade other countries?
Causing them a greater administrative headache
Friends the simple answer to this is
The kings and emperors annexed other countries
for their pride
to gain power
by comparing the sizes of their empires
and to exploit the resources in those areas
If gold was found somewhere theyd loot it
To keep it in their treasury
By the 1900s
this process of looting
was carried on by Capitalist countries too
Like the East India Company
It was the East India Company that had first captured areas in India
and started draining Indias wealth
Thats why many people call Imperialism the highest stage of capitalism
Capitalists capture other countries
exploit the raw material and cheap labour there
to earn more profit
A famous capitalist of the time
Henry Ford the founder of the Ford company
gave a famous statement on war and capitalism
There are numerous interesting things to know about World War I
but if I start telling you all of them
this video would be hours long

Now lets return to the topic
Friends this imperialism
wasnt possible without militarism
The countries had to spend a lot of money on their military
So that they could invade more countries
simply by brute force
The Royal Navy of the British
was the largest navy in the world then
With its help Britain could run their large imperialistic empire
The six great powers of the time
Britain France Germany
AustriaHungary Russia and Italy
had combined military spending of around 94 million in 1870
And by 1914
it had increased to four times this
All of these countries were spending a lot of money
on military
These countries were greatly interested in imperialism
Of capturing as many countries as possible
To extend their empire
Friends the most interesting thing was that
when I talk about a country here
by country I mostly mean the monarch of the country
The ruler of the empire
Because there werent democracies
They paid no heed to the peoples opinions
The wishes of the one at the top ran the country
And the monarchs were very ruthless
Kaiser Wilhelm II was the ruler of Germany then
He is believed to be a hottempered ruler
He was always worried about an attack on Germany by France Britain or Russia
In Russia Tsar Nicholas II was having trouble maintaining his position
He was the last emperor of the Russian Empire
And Britains HeadofState was King George V
Wanna know an interesting fact?
These three rulers were first cousins of each other
They literally belonged to the same family
The rulers of 3 countries
Can you imagine that?
World War I was literally a Game of Thrones
You can think of this as a family feud
It is said that Queen Victoria had tried to get them to stop the war
but after her death
it couldnt be possible
The fourth reason cited here was the Alliances
There were many political alliances in force among these countries
The Triple Alliance was formed in 1882
among Germany the AustroHungarian Empire and Italy
These three countries had promised mutual support to each other
if any of the Great Powers were attacked
The second major alliance was formed in 1907
called the Triple Entente
Among Great Britain France and Russia
The original reason behind forming these alliances was Imperialism
Since the countries were trying to capture the other countries
theyd later feel jealous when some other country captured more countries
They were constantly worried that if such and such country captured any particular region
they would need to capture more to protect themselves
This was all they did
In this case how did the commoners fare?
Why would the commoners fight among themselves for their rulers?
Did the people want World War I?
Friends the answer to this is mostly no
But the commoners were still pushed into the war
The first reason was that the job of the soldier then
was for the poor
A common man would become a soldier put his life at risk
for the greed of a ruler
Why would someone want to do this?
To earn money
For the lack of employment
The people that couldnt get employed anywhere else
looked for jobs as soldiers in these countries
It is a different matter to fight a war for to protect ones country
but to capture another country
to invade another country
why would anyone want to fight in a war?
From where would they get the motivation?
The answer to this is the propaganda that used to be spread then
Lingoistic Nationalism
The newspapers and media at the time
created an image
that to enlist oneself in the army
was a noble profession
Labelling it as a selfless service for the country
Soldiers were shown as gentlemen disciplined heroes
The media started glorifying War
For example Britain had gone on the Crimean War against Russia once
and because of a failed military action
200 British soldiers were killed
But the newspaper exaggerated it so much to highlight it
and the article that was printed in The Times London
Even though the top leadership made horrible decisions in the battle
due to which soldiers had to lose their lives
it was still shown as a heroic act
The monarch of Britain
appointed an official poet
Alfred Tennyson
He wrote the poem The Charge of The Light Brigade
This was one of the first poems in the world
that showed a soldier as a hero
Another famous English poet Rupert Brooke
his poems The Soldier The Dead
portrayed war and death as glorious things
He lost his life in World War I
And Winston Churchill used his poem as a death note
to recruit more people
This was the type of was mongering propaganda that was spread then
It was shown that going on a war for your country was a great act
Im putting quotes on country here
because there wasnt a democratic country there
The country referred to the rule of the emperor
And you were basically going on a war for the ruler
But not everyone fell under the influence of the propaganda
There were many people in these countries who were completely against the war
Americas Socialist Party the Italian Socialist Party
British Labour Party Russias Bolsheviks
Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg in Germany
Apart from them there were many other groups of people
Like the Anarchists and Syndicalists
who believed in Internationalism
Some people opposed the war on the basis of religion and humanity
Like Henry Ford and Valentine Bulgakov
Additionally there were poets and intellectuals like Rudyard Kipling as well
against the War
Youd recognise him as the author of the Jungle Book
Against the poem The Charge of The Light Brigade
he wrote a counter poem
The Last of The Light Brigade
It highlights the inhumane conditions that a soldier has to go through
while fighting in a war
Similarly there were poems by Wilfred Owen
that showed the bitter truth of the war
Poisonous fumes
wounded limbs
coughing blood
if you can truly understand the conditions that a soldier has to go through in war
then you would never look at war with enthusiasm
Perhaps the most legendary antiwar poem was written by Thomas Hardy in 1909
The Man He Killed
In this poem
he focuses on a soldier that has killed another soldier
because both were unemployed
they had no work
driven by the need to earn money for their family
they enlisted as soldiers
fought for their country
looked at each other and shot at one another
But had the same two people met each other in a restaurant in one of their countries
perhaps they would have merrily sang together and dined
and revelled together
These are the reasons friends that
every soldier that fought in World War I
did not come under the influence of the terrible war mongering
and we witnessed several cases of mutinies
There was a case in France where
an entire battalion
gave up their arms because they didnt want to fight in the war
In Russia the soldiers waged a war against their rulers
But the Christmas Truce of 1914 was the most interesting case
While the war was going on in 1914
come Christmas
the British and German soldiers came together
to celebrate Christmas on the battlefield
They exchanged food
sang together
and celebrated together
Because these common folks literally had no reason to fight in this war
But then their commanders ordered them to stop celebrating
and to continue with the war
They started punishing the soldiers
if they refused to fight
they would be shot down by their own troops
If someone deserts from the battles
they would be punished when caught
The soldiers were given such punishments by the country they were fighting for
To force them to fight in the war
Eventually World War I happened
and what exactly happened then lets talk about that in some future video
In part 2 of this video lets talk about
the countries that fought in World War II and the countries that won
And Indias involvement in this geopolitical game
I hope you found the video informative
If you liked it watch the video on Kargil War too
And I have made several videos on such historical education
you can watch all of them on this playlist here
Lets meet in the next video
Thank you very much!
