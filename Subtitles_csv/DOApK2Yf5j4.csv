Hello friends!
On the night of December 3 1984  at approximately midnight
In Bhopals train station Bhopal Junction
the station superintendent HS Bhurvey
and the deputy station superintendent
Ghulam Dastagir were on duty
Around 1 oclock
the GorakhpurBombay Express arrived at the station
prompting Dastagir to leave his cabin
Suddenly he experienced burning eyes and a sore throat
Concerned he searched for Bhurvey  his superior to inform him about this
but couldnt find him
Moments later he found Bhurvey lying on the ground
Dastagir tried to check whether he was breathing
but realized that Bhurvey had passed away
Dastagir immediately understood the cause
The thing is that a kilometre away from Bhopal Junction
in the Union Carbide factory
there had been a hazardous incident
releasing 50000 pounds of poisonous gas
including MIC hydrogen cyanide and phosgene
The gases were spreading rapidly all over the city
As the most senior person present Dastagir took charge
deciding that the Gorakhpurbound train  needed to leave before its scheduled departure
even though it was supposed to  stay at the station for 20 more minutes
The passengers of the train had the windows closed
and Dastagir didnt want
the passengers to be harmed in any way
With passengers safety in mind  Dastagir broke protocol
and ordered the station staff to  clear the way for an early departure
And he assumed all responsibilities of breaking this protocol
Meanwhile the crowd at the station was growing
The incident occurred during the night  when most people were asleep at home
Some individuals facing difficulty breathing
took refuge in their cars and tried to leave the city
But on the other hand those without vehicles
gathered at the station
unsure of what to do
More and more people kept coming to Bhopal Junction
People were coughing crying  and vomiting all around the station
Dastagir was running from one platform to the other
trying to help the people in any way he could
He made an SOS call to the nearby stations
after which 4 ambulances paramedics and  railway doctors reached the station to help people
Despite all efforts escaping the poisonous gas proved challenging
While on one hand some had fled  their homes to reach the station
on the other hand more people headed to hospitals
Obviously if someone experiences burning eyes  and breathing difficulties while sleeping at night
theyll go to a hospital
However the challenge was that
neither the railway doctors nor the hospital staff understood
the nature of the situation
These symptoms were unfamiliar to them
and they struggled to identify the illness or its cause
3 km from the Union Carbide factory
was Bhopals Hamidia Hospital
At the time the hospital had a capacity of approximately 1200 beds
Around 115 AM
the first patient arrived
complaining of eye irritation
Within the next five minutes
over 1000 people had gathered at the hospital
Some doctors attempted to obtain  information from the union carbide factory
but they didnt provide any useful information
The companys medical officer LD Loya told the doctors
that the gas was not poisonous
and advised the application of  wet bandages to the eyes
Meanwhile the Superintendent of Police  Swaraj Puri visited the control room
and saw that his staff was coughing  helplessly and rubbing their eyes
That was around 125 AM
He called the carbide factory
on the first two phone calls  he received assurances of
everything being okay
However after the third call
the response was uncertain
the people at the factory claimed that  they didnt know what had happened
We dont know what has happened
By 210 AM
the hospital had admitted around 4000 patients
and chaos was unfolding at Bhopal Junction Station
Dastagir had ensured that the  Gorakhpur Bombay Express had left the station
but aiding people became increasingly challenging
He later learned that his senior HS Bhurvey
had lost his life while directing another train to leave Bhopal
his senior had instructed the train not to stop at the platform
And to keep moving
Ghulam Dastagir his wife and their 4 children
lived in old Bhopal
Merely 3 km from the Union Carbide factory
But Dasgir didnt leave the station to check on his family
He remained at the station  dedicated to assisting those in need
Trains arriving at the station were prevented from stopping
they were asked to keep going
Manzoor Ahmed Khan Dasgirs colleague was
among the individuals arriving at the station to leave Bhopal
Around 3 AM he arrived at the station with their entire family
Observing Dastagir tirelessly moving from platform to platform
assisting people selflessly without concern  for his own safety or that of his family
Friends there is a new series on Netflix The Railway Men
Inspired by these reallife stories
How these unknown and unsung heroes
were grappling with the poisonous gas that fateful night
This series is the first series by Yash Raj Entertainment to be released on an OTT platform
Watching the trailer will give you
a clear sense of the suspense and thrill  embedded in the story of that night in this series
On one hand the doctors and paramedics at the stations and hospitals
were working tirelessly to save lives
On the other hand they didnt truly know
how to treat the cause of the symptoms
Most of the doctors administered eye drops  to reduce the burning sensation in the eyes
steroids to treat the inflammation
and antibiotics to prevent secondary infection
and antacids to treat stomach problems
The real solution though
depended on identifying the gas
Whether it was MIC Phosgene  or another gas like hydrogen cyanide
Initially doctors suspected phosgene poisoning
because there was a similar incident 3 years prior to this
in the same Union Carbide factory
In December 1981
resulting in the d3ath of a person working in  this factory Ashraf Muhammad Khan
Due to a phosgene leak
Conversely the company downplayed the severity claiming it was MIC
and advising simple remedies like wet bandages for eye irritation
Notably MIC vaporizes at 38C
a considerably high temperature
Whereas phosgene vaporizes at 8C
Given the December climate in Bhopal
doctors assumed phosgene to be the culprit
No one knew that at the time of this incident in the factory
the factorys temperature was around 400C
Meanwhile in America Carbides medical director Bipin Awasia
informed Bhopal authorities
that if cyanide poisoning was suspected
sodium thiosulfate should be administered as an antidote
In earlier experiments it was observed that
MIC breaks down into hydrogen cyanide during combustion
And hydrogen cyanide could be countered  effectively by sodium thiosulfate
But Bipin Awasia retracted his statement 10 days  later during a press conference in Bhopal
asserting that there was no cyanide poisoning
rendering the antidote useless
The company issued a statement
clarifying that MIC is not cyanide
and that the two should not be confused
emphasizing that MIC naturally degrades into the environment
when exposed to water
However this clarification from the company was very late
by then numerous patients were  in the hospital awaiting treatment
To help the distressed patients
on December 8th German toxicologist Max Daunderer
arrived in Bhopal with 50000 doses of sodium thiosulfate
When doctors used sodium thiosulfate
it proved quite successful
with many patients recovering
Unfortunately one patient d!ed after its administration
This led to widespread rumours that
a German doctor had k!lled a patient with sodium thiosulfate
Consequently the doctor and his antidotes were sent back
Senior professors at Gandhi Medical College  rejected the use of sodium thiosulfate
Dr M N Nagu the director of Madhya Pradeshs health services at the time
published a circular on 13th December stating that
under no circumstances shall sodium thiosulfate be given
unless it is correctly and conclusively proved in the laboratory
that it is cyanide poisoning
Despite this stance some remained convinced that
these patients were suffering from cyanide poisoning
First because when sodium thiosulfate  was being administered on some patients
positive effects were observed
And second because when Bhopal Medical  Legal Institutes Director Dr Hirish Chandra
conducted autopsies on the bodies
he found evidence of cyanide poisoning
He reiterated that sodium thiosulfate should be used
Weeks later in February
ICMR instructed doctors
to use sodium thiosulfate
The biggest question here was Why was there so much confusion?
The company that owned the factory
why did they create so much confusion about MIC and cyanide?
The direct answer is
The company was in the midst of a huge compensation claim
they wanted to minimize the side effects of MIC to save money
Government authorities were also caught in this confusion
resulting in the unfortunate d3ath of many  individuals who could have been saved
had they received the correct and timely treatment
Ghulam Dasgir the person I talked about at the beginning of this video
managed to save himself
But the last 19 years of his life
were mostly spent in the hospital
he passed away in 2003
What makes the Bhopal gas tragedy  particularly shocking is that
numerous warnings by various people  had been given before the incident
Many had voiced concerns
alerting authorities that the factory posed a constant danger
due to the lack of safety measures
Regrettably neither the company nor the government authorities
took any preventive action
In 1981 when Ashraf Khan lost his life in a Carbide accident
three experts from the US were sent by the company in May 1982
to assess the plants safety measures
Their report identified over 60 hazards
highlighting issues such as
the emergency evacuation procedures werent  shared with the people living near the factory
and that the MIC tanks could be easily contaminated
The tank pressure gauge was apparently defective
The issues and warnings raised in this report
were published in three articles
Save This City
Bhopal is Sitting on a Volcanos Mouth
Youll Perish If You Dont Take This Seriously
These articles were published in a local newspaper Rajpath
by a journalist Rajkumar Keswani within two weeks
Keshwanis last article on the Bhopal plant
was published on June 16 1984
in the national newspaper Jansatta
warning of a situation of looming disaster in Bhopal
This underscores the vital role of
independent and free media in the country
The truth is Keswani didnt do anything extraordinary
He simply carried out his job with honesty
And thats why today he emerges as an unsung hero
In his last article he made another major revelation
that in 1975 Bhopal Municipal Corporation
was headed by a highly respected bureaucrat MN Buch
He had issued a notice to remove Carbide from Bhopal
Consequently Buch was transferred
and Carbide paid 25000 to the Corporation
for the construction of a public park
With this Keswani hinted at
a collusion within the government to aid Carbide
in successfully continuing its factory operations
Similar narratives are explored in The Railwaymen series
you can watch it on Netflix
For a deeper understanding of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy
and the subsequent developments involving the company
and the events leading to the incident that night
