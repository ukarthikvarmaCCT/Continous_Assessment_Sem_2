This is a knife
Good luck Lets go Tareq
The Boys Oh oh what do we do?
Tareq Oh my gosh we gotta go
Jimmy Tareq our first stops through the woods
Tareq Jimmy why are we doing this again already?
Relax for one second Ive been tied up before
Chris Hes getting so much time ahead of us
Jimmy Were coming out the other side of the woods
Our getaway car is over here
Tareq Whoa thats a nice car Jim
Jimmy The car matches my bag
Tareq We gotta go We gotta go
Chris How are you gonna catch him
if your hands are tied?
And now we drive down this path
You guys have no idea what I have in store for the boys
I rented an NFL football stadium an island a maze
and tons of other cool things
And stop!
Tareq Oh! Why are we stopping already?
Just watch
You see this giant telephone pole?
Tareq Uh huh

Buckle up
Now theres a giant telephone pole blocking the exit
The Boys Oh

The Boys Hurry

Ohh!  Push go
Karl Guys hurry up!
We put a GPS in my underwear
so the FBI agent and the boys will always know where Im at
Nolan Jimmy turned
Chris Oh wait he turned?
Nolan He turned left
If you zoom in
Its a maze!
Its a maze!
It gives us the layout of the maze
Were now at the Hedge Maze
and I got the hundred thousand dollars
Look at how huge this maze is
We gotta be careful because itd be easy to get lost
and for them to catch us in here
Jimmy Uh I think its this way
Tareq OkayUh how do you know?
Ive done this maze like 10 times
but the boys have never been here
Were just gonna push him and push him
get him out of the area
and then as hes tiring well handle this
Im gonna leave them some money here
so they know theyre going the right way
Or a random persons just gonna find a grand
Jimmy chuckles
The Boys Go go go go go go go!
Nolan It says open 11 to five
Kurt See if we can actually get right through it
Chris Ooh
Kurt Here we go
Jimmy It was right right left right
left right right left
Perfect Okay
If youre in the cave youre in the right spot
which means if we go here
now we are officially in the watch tower
We can see the entire maze
Im gonna do a perimeter check
Make sure he is not outside
We gotta find the getaway car
Hey Karl come on
Theres that nerd  Hey there he is!
Ooh!  Okay!
Jimmy I bet you cant get me
Ooh The only exit is right here
Chris Why is there money over here?
That was just to let you know
you were going the right way
Chris Jimmy were almost there
Just wait
Oh they are getting close
Shoot okay We gotta go we gotta go
Theyre getting closer
I dont know how long I planned on staying there
Tareq laughs
Chris Hes older than us
but hes got so much more energy
Isnt this where Jimmy was?
Kurt Yes it was
I know youre looking at this Jimmy
Im taking your camera now
The only exit outside of this entire maze
is all the way up there
which is why yesterday we put in a secret door
Tareq Oh wow Jimmy this is crazy
Wait Jimmy is that our getaway car?
Notice how this says Authorized Maze Personnel Only
Now it says Jimmys Getaway Car
Kurt Hey guys lets go back to the car
The trackers showing him up on the hill
Karl All right To the car!
The Boys Lets go!  Kurt Lets go
Karl Go go go go go  Nolan Get in
I wonder if theyve noticed were not in the maze anymore
Nolan Hes getting on the highway
Chris Which way? Left or right?
Right  Right
We can make all the mistakes in the world
Doesnt matter
Hes just gotta make one
He gotta make one
Yo there were parts where we were so close to them
in the maze
That was terrifying
If they wouldve caught us there
this video wouldve been only like two minutes
I made a mistake
Tareqs supposed to be driving Lets switch
Tareq Lets switch
Karl is the is that money real?
Oh its real real
Oh good
boys laughing
And the reason Tareq is driving
is because I need to put on a disguise
soft exciting music
I look so old
Now we put the hat on throw on a pair of glasses and boom
Im Boomer Jim
And were heading to Walmart
where Im gonna try to blend in with normal people
Do you think he went to the mall to shop
and we all go shopping?
Were pulling up to Walmart and Im gonna go inside
with the hundred thousand dollars and the tracker
Theres a pickax back here
And while theyre inside searching for me
you need to pop all the tires on their car to strand them
Jimmy Ive never popped a tire in my life
Lets do this
Chris Wait It says were on top of him
The Boys Hey!
Kurt Yeah It says were right on top of him
Take a take a right down here
Karl Hes right here
Dont let me down with popping the tires
Tareq I wont God speed
Park away from cars and lets assess the situation
And now Im inside Walmart
And before I blend in I need to disguise this bag
Now Im gonna take the hundred thousand dollar backpack
and put it in this bag
Now theyll never catch me
You and I will go inside
You two stay stay together
And lets see if we can search em out
Inside! Hold his hand there ya go
Were staying together

Look at em running
Chris Looking for a six foot four guy
with a weird beard
I can literally see the boys
walking down the gaming aisle
I know that Jimmy told me to pop all the tires
but Im just gonna do one
Cuz I think Im running low on time
FBI? More like FB flat tire!
air hissing
Tareq running
Oh I gotta get the camera
Hes not walking around anywhere Hes gotta be hiding
phone ringing
Jimmy Did you do the deed?
The deed is done
Theyre so close to me Im getting outta here
Tareq Hurry up grandpa
I cant believe that worked
They were literally one aisle beside me at one point
Whats the tracker say?
Kurt The trackers moving The vehicles moved
Wait its moving?  In the parking lot?
Hes outta thehes outta Walmart?
It feels amazing to have that mask off
Weve knocked over a telephone pole
had a goose chase through a maze
and then hid in a Walmart as an old man
And the videos just getting started
I have so much more cool stuff planned
Like Im literally heading to the airport
to board a private jet right now
Wait a second!  Whats that?
Who popped our tires? Theres a pickax in our tire
Well if we dont have a car were gonna change a flat
Nolan Do you know how to change a tire?
Of course I know how to change a tire
Chris Remember you wanna go two or
car falling
Yeah Thats why I dont like those jacks
Kurt Yep
Karl Yeah?
Do you know where I was hiding at Walmart?
Basically I put on an old man suit
changed my clothes and used a cane
Did you see a really old guy limping?
I dont pay attention to old people
Well if you did see one in Walmart it was me
Good luck nerd!
phone call ends
Chris groaning
Nolan Chris you working hard?
Chris Youre hardly working
Were getting close to the airport
Im gonna call the private jet and make sure theyre ready
It looks like hes on a taxiing runway
Hes gonna get in a plane and fly away
This is why he slashed the tires
And theres our private jet Lets go
Im getting on a private jet with the dumbest outfit
and a Cars backpack
What am I doing with my life?
Come on Youre taking forever
Im gonna try to time it where the private jet takes off
when they get here so they can see me flying away
Whats up Jimmy?
Hey buddy How far away are you?
Were at the Walmart man Still fixing the tire
Okay Well
Hey Jimmy if you had to pick a terminal to go into

Oh so that means youre here
Pilot you can take off
Chris Run run run Go go go go go go go
upbeat music
Kurt Last door

Chris If I was Jimmy where would I hide?
Nolan Kurt? Kurt
Tareq Jimmy go go go go
The Boys Yes! Lets go!
Honestly Ive been running for like 14 hours

I dont feel like getting tackled
He can just have the money
What are you gonna spend the hundred grand on?
Im gonna spend it on my wife
Im gonna make sure that my family is enjoys it
thats the important thing
Thats really sweet
One of the best experiences Ive ever had
In our last video I mentioned that every single person
that buys this executive producer shirt or hoodie
will get their name at the end of this video
which is why you see names on the left side of your screen
Because that is every single person
that purchased this shirt or hoodie
And I didnt tell you guys I would do this
but on top of that
we also wrote every single one of your names
on the wall of my studio
Literally every day when I come in to film
Im gonna see your name on this wall
Like Peter Wild when I film Im gonna be reminded of you
And same with Knox and Knox Tucker and Koda
and Koda G and all these Michaels
And on top of that Chandler bring it on in
I also got all your names put on this Tesla
Thats right Not only are all your names on my studio wall
but your names are also on this Tesla
And this is the fun part
Chandler I want you to pick a random name on this Tesla
and were gonna give it to them in like 30 seconds
All right lets do it
Matt Liggett
Jimmy What about him?
Chandler He didnt win
Jimmy Oh he didnt win?
Well tell me when you have the winner
Hey Jimmy you have Peyton Chicken Nugget
as one of your fans
Can you investigate that? See if thats their real name
Im thinking probably not
Derpyfish 89
I told you to use your real name
but I didnt actually fact check it
You go in the S category
Theres a bunch of Sponge Bobs
And I know your names arent SpongeBob
Tell me when to stop
Uh wait for it now stop
Oh Which finger?
Im a pinky kinda guy
Alexander Hedge this Tesla
The Boys Yeah! All right
I dont know if that made any sense
Congratulations Alexander You just won a brand new Tesla
Sorry that its covered in names
