Hello friends!
What is the mystery of the Taj Mahal?
Whats hiding behind the 22 closed doors of the Taj Mahal?
Some people claim that idols of Hindu Gods are hidden behind them
On the other hand some say that they are hiding the fabled good days
The first door hiding cheap petrol and diesel
the second hiding employment opportunities
Some people have gone further and said that the Taj Mahal is actually a Shiv Temple
whose real name is Tejo Mahalaya
According to a theory it wasnt built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan
rather it was built by Raja Paramardi Dev
in the 13th century
After that it was passed down to Raja Maan Singh
and Shah Jahan bought the Taj Mahal
from his grandson Raja Jai Singh
Another popular theory about the Taj Mahal is that
Shah Jahan had chopped off the hands of 20000 labourers
after building the Taj Mahal
so the workers who worked on the Taj Mahal
couldnt build any other monument as beautiful as it
In one theory the Tejo Mahalaya was built in the 13th century
In the other Shah Jahan had chopped off the hands of the workers in the 17th century
about 450 years later
So both theories cannot be true
So in todays video come lets try to find out the truth
What is the history of the Taj Mahal?
How much truth do these theories hold?
And whats hidden behind the 22 closed doors of the Taj Mahal?
The 7th Wonder of the World a symbol of love
Its said that history is based on facts and not on emotions
What history? Whose history? Whose version of history?
BJP government demands the 22 closed doors of the Taj Mahal be reopened
And the judges have slammed the Taj Mahal petitioner
Friends lets understand the real history of the Taj Mahal first
Shah Jahan and Mumtaz
What were their real names?
Shah Jahan was born on 5th January 1592
his real name was Khurram
Shah Jahan was the royal name
which was bestowed on him later
literally meaning the King of the World
Shah Jahan
His father was Jahangir and his mother was Jagat Gosain
The chief queen of Jahangir
Mumtaz Mahal was born in 1593
The name Mumtaz Mahal was bestowed on her after her wedding
Her real name was Arjumand Banu Begum
Khurram and Mumtaz were engaged in 1907
and they were married in 1612
Shah Jahan had other wives as well
Including Qandahari Mahal and Akbarabadi Mahal
But according to court historians
these marriages were based on political alliances
Various historical accounts tell us that
Shah Jahans relationship with his other wives
were marriages only in name
They were simply to maintain political alliances
Shah Jahans affection and love for Mumtaz
was much more than that for his other wives
this is why she was given more favours
Such as the title of MalikaiJahan
The Queen of the World
Her palace Khas Mahal
was said to have been decorated with pure gold and precious stones
According to historical records
Mumtaz showed great interest in administration as well
So when Shah Jahan went for diplomatic negotiations
or for war
Mumtaz always accompanied him
Shah Jahan had exactly one child with all his other wives
with Mumtaz Mahal he had 14 children
Half of the children died during childbirth
This used to be much more common back then
The healthcare system used to be terrible
Unfortunately Mumtaz died while giving birth to their 14th child
It happened on 17th June 1631
The cause of death is said to be postpartum haemorrhage
Loss of blood
After her death Shah Jahan went into deep grief
He was paralysed with grief
He cried for days and weeks on end
And it is said that he was in isolation for a year mourning the death of his wife
When he appeared again its said that his hair had turned white
His back was bent
and his face showed his despair
In Islamic theology it is believed that
the body of the deceased turns into soil
but the soul remains in the grave
Later on Judgement Day the souls will return to the Creator
when itll be decided if the soul would go to heaven or hell
So the grave is known as the final resting place of a soul
Shah Jahan believed that the final resting place of Mumtaz Mahal
should be grand
When he decided to build the Taj Mahal
the Chief Architect was Ustad Ahmad Lahori
was bestowed the title NadireAsr
The Wonder of the Age
The calligraphy on the white marble panels
was done by Abdul Haq Shirazi
More than 1000 elephants were used
for transporting the building materials
The white marble was brought in from Rajasthan
Jasper from Punjab
Jade and Crystal from China
Turquoise from Tibet
Sapphire from Sri Lanka
And Carnelian from Arabia
The gems and materials that can be found in the Taj Mahal
have come from all over the world
In total it took 22 years to build the Taj Mahal
For its construction and decoration
Approximately 22000 labourers
worked on it every day for 22 years
Friends the history of controversies about the Taj Mahal has been long
But lets begin our story with the most recent controversy
The recent controversy began with the news
that BJP politician Rajneesh Singh
had filed a petition in Allahabad High Court
that the 22 closed rooms of the Taj Mahal should be opened
He wanted ASI the Archaeological Survey of India
to set up a special committee
to look into the 22 closed rooms
And would investigate if there are any idols of Hindu Gods in there
This petition held that
there were claims that the Taj Mahal is actually a Hindu Temple
called Tejo Mahalaya
and that it was the duty of the court to direct the opening of the closed doors
under the Freedom of Information
But this petition was dismissed by the court
the bench of judges said that
by filing such petitions
the PIL system was being mocked
The court asked for the basis of the petition
Whether any legal or constitutional rights were being infringed here
If not what were the grounds for the petition?
Historical research is handled by historians
and for that proper methodology needs to be followed
But friends if you think that after the dismissal of this petition
the secret would always remain a secret
dont fret
In this video Ill tell you the secret hidden behind the locked doors
Friends the thing is that
ASI sources have already told the Indian Express
that these 22 rooms arent rooms really
Its actually a long corridor
with doors on its side
And the locked doors in question havent always been locked
According to the source the ASI staff
clean out the corridor each week or in a couple of weeks
A retired ASI official has said that
theres nothing on the walls
To have such rooms in the basement is not unusual for Mughal monuments
The Humayuns Tomb in Delhi  and the Safdarjung Tomb
both have similar underground rooms in the basement
They make up a corridor
and act as the structural element
on which the monument rests
Another retired ASI official revealed that
the area was cordoned off
because there was nothing for the tourists to see
If they are kept open unnecessarily
there would be a crowd there
So to preserve the monument the areas have been locked
After all the Taj Mahal is a protected World Heritage Site
with more than 100000 visitors every day
So with so many people constantly passing through
they wanted to avoid the wear and tear and protect the monument
Even after the petition was dismissed
after ASI officials explained things
the debate didnt stop
Some people in the media and social media kept this debate on unreasonably
It seemed almost like someone was benefiting from this
by discussing these things
So after about 3 or 4 days
the Archaeological Survey of India
tried to end this debate forever
by releasing pictures
They publicly shared photos of the closed rooms
They showed the restoration work going on
and what the rooms looked like from the inside
Agras ASI Chief R K Patel told India Today
that the pictures can be found live on the website of ASI
And that it was a part of their newsletter
and anyone can see the pictures by going to their website
There was one thing noteworthy in these photos
and it was the hard work of the ASI staff
for the conservation of our monuments
You can see the before and after pictures here
before and after the restoration works
It is only due to them
that our historical gems continue to be preserved like so
Friends this wasnt the first time that such claims were made
There were several similar petitions before this as well
Such as in April 2015
a similar suit was filed in the Agra court by six lawyers
who claimed that the Taj Mahal was actually a Shiv Temple
They asked the court for permission
to allow Hindus to worship there
In their plea lawyer Hari Shankar Jain and his colleagues said that
that it was Raja Paramardi Dev who built Tejo Mahalaya in 1212 AD
And that this temple was later inherited by Raja Maan Singh in the 17th century
After which the property was held by Raja Jai Singh
and then in 1632 Shah Jahan annexed it
After the death of Mumtaz Mahal
after the death of Shah Jahans wife
this temple was converted into a memorial for Mumtaz
Then the court directed the Central Government
Union Ministry of Culture
Home Secretary and the ASI
to submit their replies to this claim
In the reply the government denied this possibility
In November 2015 the Union Cultural Minister Mahesh Sharma
told the Lok Sabha that the government found no evidence
that the Taj Mahal was a Hindu Temple
The ASI said the same thing
In 2017 the Archaeological Survey of India had said
that the Taj Mahal is a tomb not a temple
This is quite different from the Gyanvapi Masjid controversy
because theres actually proof
that there was once a temple
But lets discuss that controversy in some other video
and lets focus on the Taj Mahal in this video
They clarified the story about Raja Jai Singh
and said that the land was annexed from him
instead it was given by him in exchange
It has an interesting history behind it friends
In 2017 historian Rana Safi had written a blog
on the DailyO platform
a blogging platform of the India Today group
In it she wrote that Mughals were very interested in keeping a record of history
Many Mughal Emperors had written autobiographies
they wrote in journals
Such as Jahangirnama written by Jahangir
Additionally they even had the official history written down by court historians
For example during Akbars reign
AbulFazl had kept a record of history
Apart from these there were other accounts of history
written by other people of the era
These are known as Contemporary Accounts
These contemporary texts were compiled by
W E  Begley and Z A Desai
in their book Taj Mahal The Illumined Tomb
The various sources of that time
were compiled together so that we can see them in that context
and get to know the detailed history of the Taj Mahal
How the Taj Mahal was built
What were the methods used back then?
All of it has been documented beautifully
Raja Jai Singh had friendly relations with Shah Jahan
We get to know that Raja Jai Singh used to live in the area
where the Taj Mahal is built
That place has been referred to in multiple sources as Haveli Khana and Manzil
Different sources use different words
But these words were used to mean home
Small or big Raja Jai Singhs home was there
Raja Jai Singh actually wanted to donate his land for free
to build the tomb for the Emperess
Historian Ira Mukhtoy tells us
that this is because the royals of Jaipur
had close relations to the Mughals
after Akbars marriage to Amers Harka Bai
Bollywood films will have us believe that
Akbars wifes name was Jodha Bai
As shown in the picture Jodha Akbar
A good film but in this instance historically incorrect
Jodha Bai literally means a Lady from Jodhpur
But it was Jahangir
who had married the daughter of Jodhpurs ruler Raja Uday Singh
His daughter was Jagat Gosain
She was Shah Jahans mother
Back then a British East India Company officer
Lt Col James Todd
wrote a book Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan
In that book he had mistakenly mentioned
Jodha Bai instead of Harka Bai
Thats why people have this confusion
that Jodha Bai was Akbars wife
Akbars wife was Harka Bai
she was Raja Maan Singhs aunt
And Raja Maan Singh was the trusted general of Akbar
Shah Jahan was Akbars grandson
and Raja Jai Singh was Raja Maan Singhs grandson
You can now understand why the two had such close relations
Raja Jai Singh and Shah Jahan
This is why Raja Jai Singh offered his land for free
he wanted to donate it to Shah Jahan
so that Shah Jahan could build a tomb for Mumtaz
But despite his offer Shah Jahan didnt accept the offer of the land for free
In exchange Shah Jahan gave four palaces to Raja Jai Singh
This transaction has been recorded in official papers as well
and it was dated as it happened
28th December 1633
You can see this record in Jaipurs City Palace now
Historian Rana Safi uploaded a copy of it with translation on Twitter
Friends if you find the history of this era quite interesting

And now lets get back to the topic
But who spread the lies?
That Raja Jai Singh had a temple there
which was then forcefully taken away by Shah Jahan?
The existence of Tejo Mahalaya a Shiv Temple
is not supported by any evidence
But the lies must have come from somewhere
That are now being repeated everywhere
The answer to this friends is one person
Purushottam Nagesh Oak
also known as PN Oak
He was the person who came up with the claim of Tejo Mahalaya
Interestingly he was not a historian
He was a history enthusiast
and enjoyed writing history as well
But he wasnt a historian
because he made up his version of history
He rewrote history
Friends the methodology of historians
is extensive and tiring
A historian has to look through old newspapers and magazines
diary entries letters
painting historical accounts of court historians
accounts of contemporary historians
accounts of travellers carbon dating
and then they have to analyse them to understand
what would have happened back then
After theyve understood it they have to write it down
and create an account by citing the various sources theyve relied on
Then their writing is peerreviewed
by other historians
to check how accurate
the account written by the historian
But PN Oaks methodology was vastly different from it
The methodology he used worked somewhat like this
Since the word Vatican sounds similar to the Sanskrit word Vatika
hed write that it was probable that Vatican had once been a Hindu temple
He didnt stop at probable he wrote it as if that was the truth
Westminster Abbey was also a Hindu temple
And Im not joking guys
These were the things written by PN Oak in his pamphlets
If you think these sound weird
he has written things way weirder than these
He had written a pamphlet on Christianity
He said that Christianity is actually ChrisnNity ideology of Hindu deity Krishna
According to him Jesus Christ had visited India
between the ages of 13 and 30 years old
and he had learned Krishnas ideologies here
And so the entirety of Christianity
is therefore inspired by Hinduism
Not only this but he also claimed that
Islam and Judaism too have come from Hinduism
Because Abraham sounds like Brahma
Abrahams wife Sarah
was probably Saraswati
Moses would be Mahesh aka Shiv
In fact according to him the entire world was ruled by an ancient Hindu empire
Coming back to the topic of the Taj Mahal
it was PN Oak who created this conspiracy theory about the Taj Mahal
In his opinion the Mughals didnt build any monuments
Initially PN Oak said that the Taj Mahal was a wonder of ancient Hinduism
built in ancient times
The historians refuted this by saying that buildings from before the 4th century
have only survived is they were made by cutting out rocks
No other buildings have survived
So this couldnt be possible
The Taj Mahal was actually built in the 1600s
After this Oak revised his claim
Then he said that it was built in the year 1155
by Raja Paramardi Dev
By the Chief Minister of the Raja Dev
When history is so close to home it doesnt take long to be revised
In 1989 he wrote another pamphlet titled
Taj Mahal The True Story
On the basis of his own pamphlet
he filed a PIL in the court in 2000 saying that
we need to know the truth behind it
Interestingly in court he had also cited that
Shah Jahan had acquired Raja Jai Singhs palace
So he took one line from actual history
and the remaining part was fabricated by him with an active imagination
To be honest PN Oak could have been a brilliant fiction author
But for some reason he chose to be a selfproclaimed historian
Supreme Court had dismissed his petition saying that
it was a misconceived notion
the Supreme Court had even ridiculed him
saying that it seemed he was bitten by a bee
And so we arrive at 2010
WhatsApp started gaining traction
The WhatsApp University began
And the fictional tales of PN Oak
turn into theories of the WhatsApp University
When these fictional stories are forwarded time and again
and reach people
People start believing them to be true accounts
and then there are fresh petitions put to our courts
And then our courts have to waste their time on such futile petitions
Interestingly after being forwarded so many times in WhatsApp University
PN Oak had talked about the year 1155
but in the latest petition filed in the court
the petitioner claimed that it was built in the year 1212
The petition talks about the history of the Taj Mahal as well
According to it Raja Paramardi Dev had built Tejo Mahalaya in 1212
But what difference does it make?
These fake theories now become topics for extended debates on TV
And then the people on TV debate as if
this is a huge mystery
As if we dont know what the truth is
When the entire truth has been repeated time and time again
Another famous claim about Shah Jahan is that
Shah Jahan had chopped off the hands of the workers
after the Taj Mahal was built
So that they couldnt build another monument like the Taj Mahal
Our Union Agricultural Minister Narendra Singh Tomar
had repeated this claim last year
saying that
the Taj Mahal was built in Agra
and the workers who built it
had their hands chopped off
But the workers working on the Vishwanath Corridor
will be welcomed with a petal shower
a new tradition was started in this country by PM Narendra Modi
If you try to think about this claim logically
you will wonder how it could have been possible
The 20000 workers who had built the Taj Mahal
were their hands chopped off on the same day?
If not were they asked to come in one by one
youre they next one to get your hands chopped off
And everyone stood in a queue waiting for their turn
It wouldnt have been possible to cut off the hands of 20000 people in a day
So they had a list of names of the workers whose hands were to be chopped off that day
and then theyd turn away those who were scheduled for another day
Asking them to adhere to the schedule
If that happened would the workers have waited in the queue
waiting for their turn to get the hands cut off?
Waiting in the queue for his turn
As soon as they would have started cutting off their hands
the others would have run away
Obviously theres zero evidence of it being true historically
Had this been true
archaeologically we would have found skeletal remains of the hands somewhere
This would have been mentioned somewhere in some book
Some court historians would have mentioned it
There were several travellers there during that era from foreign countries
they wrote books as well
something would have been mentioned somewhere at least
But there are no mentions of it
In fact the evidence that we have
are contrary to this claim
Shah Jahan had built a huge settlement
known as Taj Ganj
it still exists today
thousands of masons artisans and workers
assembled there from different regions of the empire
to work on the Taj Mahal together
The descendants of those workers
still live there and work there
and practice the skill of their forefathers
Actually after building the Taj Mahal
Shah Jahans workers built an entirely new city
It was named Shahjahanabad
Later named Delhi
So think about it logically
the Taj Mahal Red Fort Jama Masjid
were built around the same time
Had the hands of the workers being chopped off
how could the empire have built such enormous monuments?
Shah Jahans period is believed to be
the Golden Period of Mughal Architecture
it was possible only because
when Shah Jahan respected his workers
Today for many people
the Taj Mahal is a symbol of Love
Poets like Shakeel have written about it describing it as
An Emperor built the majestic Taj Mahal
and gave the world a symbol of love
On the other hand legendary poets like Sahir Ludhyanvi had written
An Emperor created a display of wealth
to ridicule the affection of the poor
Irrespective of the version of the poem that is true
today it cannot be denied
that the Taj Mahal is an architectural marvel
It is one of the official Seven Wonders of the World
and a UNESCO World Heritage Site
Indias one of the most popular tourist attractions
people from all around the world come to see it
There is no reason not to be proud of it
It is a gem of India in all aspects
If this was an informative video
you can watch other history videos in this playlist
and the next time you see someone
whether in your WhatsApp groups or your friend or family member
repeating such baseless rumours about the Taj Mahal
do share this video with them
Thank you very much!
