In September of 2009 a critical event unfolded in the rugged terrains of the Shuryak Valley
in Kunar province Afghanistan
A powerful Blackhawk helicopter on its mission to rescue wounded Marines found itself under
intense fire from Taliban militiamen
The situation on the ground was dire the defending forces were outnumbered and the
Blackhawks position became increasingly perilous amid the escalating firefight
In this tense moment pilot Patrick Benson made a sudden and unexpected appearance in
the most surprising of helicopters barely suited for the situation
His Bell OH58 typically used for light reconnaissance entered the fray
Despite its compact size the OH58 was no stranger to combat
It could be armed with an array of weapons including Stinger airtoair missiles a 50caliber
machine gun podded 70mm Hydra rockets and AGM114 Hellfire airtoground missiles
It was a bold move and Benson drew the enemys fire towards the small helicopter risking
his life to protect the wounded Marines
The OH58 took several hits with its nose being punctured by small arms fire injuring
both Benson and his copilot
Despite his injuries Benson persisted in his efforts ensuring the Blackhawk could
safely evacuate the area
This act of bravery and dedication to his fellow soldiers would later earn Benson and
his copilot the accolades they rightly deserved
Moreover this incident showcased the resilience and dependability of the OH58 aptly nicknamed
the Kiowa Warrior
The Ugly Duckling Following the success of the Americanmade
helicopters deployed during the Far East campaigns of World War 2 the military envisioned and
developed several types of rotary wing aircraft tailored for different uses
Besides providing transport for troops and carrying supplies for logistical support
such as the Korean War era Sioux or the future Chinook helicopters began to be employed
for retrieving other helicopters and aircraft and even delivering artillery and ground vehicles
across difficult terrain
Others such as the future Bell AH1 Cobra would find their purpose as gunships armed
to the teeth ready to provide immediate fire support to allied ground troops and effectively
decimate the enemy
As American involvement in Vietnam increased the United States Navy commenced looking for
a replacement for the Bell OH13 Sioux and Hiller OH23 Raven for the reconnaissance
Both helicopters had been successfully used during the Korean War for MEDVAC or medical
However they struggled with their piston engines offering a maximum output of 250
shaft horsepower
On behalf of the Army the US Navy approached over 20 helicopter manufacturers for the submission
of proposals for a Light Observation Helicopter or LOH
The designs had to be powered by an Allison 250C20B free turbine engine and their primary
role was to be the eyes in the skies for military intelligence
Besides reconnaissance the rotarywing aircraft had to be capable of ground attack transport
and medical evacuation roles
Of the twelve helicopter manufacturers that entered the competition only three were shortlisted
Bell presented the YOH4A or Model 206 Hughes the YOH6A Model 369 and Hiller the YOH5A
Bell produced five prototypes of its helicopter that were tested thoroughly in 1962
During its maiden flight Army and Navy personnel referred to the YOH4A as the Ugly Duckling
when compared to the competitors
It was not a good omen
Ranger to the Rescue After testing the Bell Hiller and Hughes
helicopters the Army ultimately settled for the Hughes OH6 Cayuse Loach in May
Despite the Armys decision Dave Ostrowski an Army aeronautical engineer in the LOH contest
said in issue 10 of Take Off magazine that Bells model QUOTE Sprang off the ground
like a homesick angel
It had power speed and maneuverability
It felt good
It was a super ship to fly
Nevertheless it was not over yet for Bell
They knew their helicopter had potential and the company decided to market it for civilian
But first the engineers had to redesign the Ugly Duckling to attract customers
The displeasing bubble face canopy and small fuselage had to be reshaped to be easier on
the eye provide more space for the cramped quarters of the three passengers and ample
cargo space
In January 1966 Bell presented a redesigned fuselage and dubbed the new helicopter the
Model 206A Jet Ranger
The fuselage was more aesthetically pleasing added over 16 cubic feet of cargo space for
luggage and made the passenger compartment more pleasing providing enough space for
up to five people
Furthermore the Jet Ranger was also modified internally
It was now powered by a 317 horsepower Allison 250C18 engine
The Ranger had its maiden flight the same month and experienced no issues
It became a best seller in the coming months becoming a familiar sight around the United
The Jet Ranger was adopted by the government forest services law enforcement news broadcasters
and tour companies
Bells Jet Ranger became so recognizable that even Italian manufacturer Agusta acquired
the production rights to fly the Jet Ranger over the skies of Europe
In January 1968 Bell scored big when the Jet Ranger was solicited by the US Navy to
come up with a modified variant for flight training
Over 40 TH57 Sea Rangers were produced
And there was more to come for Model 206
The Kiowa While Bells Jet Ranger flew thousands of
people across the US without incidents Hughes OH6A Cayuse struggled in Southeast Asia
The fighting in Vietnam had turned into a meat grinder
In January 1968 the North Vietnamese launched a mass offensive during the Tet New Year festivities
and dozens of cities were sieged by the Communist forces
Thanks to the effectiveness of the Ho Chi Minh Trail the North Vietnamese Army was
now supplied and equipped with modern Soviet and Chinese equipment including antiaircraft
countermeasures that were making quick work of the American OH6A Cayuses
The Cayuse was exposed to enemy fire during scouting and artillery fire correction missions
making it an easy target for hidden Viet Cong or NVA troops
Casualties for Hughes helicopter were piling up and the company could not keep up with
production and its costs
The Army reopened the LOH competition because Hughes could not meet production demands
Bell submitted its upgraded Model 206 Jet Ranger and won the contract
It was designated OH58A and named the Kiowa following the Armys tradition of honoring
Native American tribes
The OH59 Kiowa was delivered to Army inventories in May 1969
It had a length of 34 feet a width of 35 feet and a height of 129 feet
The scout helicopter had a weight of 3289 pounds
Compared to its civilian variant the Kiowa featured military instruments multiple radios
Army olive drab livery and deflecting blades above the canopy and belove the nose to avoid
crashes with electrical wires
The Kiowa was also powered by an Allison T63A700 engine rated at 315 horsepower mounted atop
and to the rear of the passenger cabin
The cockpit was wellforward and provided allaround visibility for the pilot and copilot
thanks to the large windscreens and the option to remove hinged side doors
Changing the Mission Behind the cockpit the passenger cabin featured
entryexit doors and enough room for three soldiers or two medical litters
The first Kiowa variant featured a flexible twinbladed main rotor that would later be
replaced with a fourbladed one with the OH58D model
The first batch of Kiowas arrived in Vietnam in August 1969 to support the Hughes Cayuse
in the reconnaissance observation and medical evacuation roles
The Kiowas were lightly armed with either an M129 40millimeter automatic grenade launcher
or a powerful 762millimeter M134 Minigun that could fire up to 4000 rounds per minute
During a North Vietnamese offensive in April 1972 John Paul Vann a US civilian advisor
who often piloted Kiowas directly coordinated the attack of AC130s jet fighters Cobras
and Hueys to destroy enemy formations trying to overrun Firebase Delta in the Highlands
In his book A Bright Shining Lie Author Neil Sheehan recalls that Vann unsatisfied
with providing guidance for US aircraft began stocking his Kiowa with as many supplies as
the helicopter could handle to deliver them to Firebase Delta
Six times the brave man and his Kiowa delivered ammunition and other supplies to the besieged
troops under enemy ground fire
Weeks later Vann and his Kiowa were landed in a ravine to extract US and South Vietnamese
advisors while enemy tanks approached
The helicopter escaped unscratched
But Vanns luck soon ran out
On June 9 1972 he and his entire crew were lost when his Kiowa crashed into a hill due
to low visibility and light rain
Over 310 Kiowas served in Vietnam between 1969 and 1973
More than 50 of them were combat losses
The Warrior Following the end of the Vietnam War the
US and NATO prepared for a possible largescale Soviet Invasion of Western Europe
The Soviets had AA defenses that were far more effective than the highly effective Strela
2man portable air defense system
This led to an improved variant of the Kiowa equipped with an ANAPR39A Radar Warning
Receiver to inform the crew about enemy radars and night vision goggles for night operations
A more powerful engine made the helicopter faster and more maneuverable
This was the Charlie variant or OH58C
Nevertheless this variant did not solve the armament issue the Kiowa faced since Vietnam
Meanwhile the Army was hard at work introducing the iconic UH60 Blackhawk and the AH64 Apache
In 1981 the Army Helicopter Program upgraded the Kiowa with sophisticated sensors a thermal
imager a laser designator and the iconic MMS or Mast Mounted Sight that made the Kiowa
easily recognizable
The Kiowa Warrior or the OH58D variant was fitted with a RollsRoyce T703AD700A
turboshaft engine providing 650 horsepower and a top speed of 149 miles per hour
It had a range of 345 miles and a service ceiling of over 15000 feet
The Warrior packed some punch and was armed with 127millimeter machine guns in either
M296 or M3P mounts Hellfireguided antitank missiles Hydra 70 highexplosive unguided
rockets and AIMS92 Stinger airtoair missiles
During the 1980s and 1990s over 400 Kiowas were upgraded to the Warrior variant becoming
crucial for their new armed light scout role during the conflicts of the Middle East in
the same decade
Iraq and Iran were engulfed in a power struggle that resulted in US involvement in providing
escort services to merchant ships in the Persian Gulf
The Kiowas were bound for the Persian Gulf
Reagans War on Drugs Kiowa Warriors replaced other helicopters
for Operation Prime Chance during the IranIraq War
The objective was to escort oil tankers
From February to September 1988 the Kiowas patrolled the Persian Gulf but were never
engaged by the Iranian Navy
During these operations the Kiowas cooperated with Task Force 118 Little Birds locating
and evading enemy vessels
One year later in 1989 they returned to the Middle East when Iraq invaded Kuwait
As Operation Desert Shield turned into Operation Desert Storm over 115 Kiowas were deployed
for different combat roles
Like in Vietnam the Kiowas spotted Iraqi objectives for Apache helicopters and other
attack aircraft to hunt them down
They also provided artillery fire correction to properly strike the enemy
No Kiowa Warrior was lost in combat during the war against Iraq during the Gulf War
During this time the Kiowas were also dispatched to the US following Reagans War on Drugs
The National Guard Bureau created Reconnaissance and Aerial Interdiction Detachments or RAIDs
of which over 80 were Kiowas that conducted more than 1200 counterdrug reconnaissance
and interdiction operations
At the dawn of the XXI century the Kiowas were again deployed to the Middle East as
part of the War on Terror
The OH58D became part of the air units participating in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring
Freedom in Afghanistan
According to Bell the Kiowas flew over 820000 combat hours by April 2013
Over 35 helicopters were lost in combat operations and accidents before American retirement from
Drawing Enemy Fire While in Afghanistan Chief Warrant Officer
Patrick Benson flew numerous reconnaissance and security missions on a Kiowa becoming
the eyes in the sky for American attack helicopters
In September 2009 Benson and his copilot were providing security and reconnaissance
for infantry attacking Taliban troops in a mountain in what is known today as the Shuriak
Benson left the area for a refuel and minutes later the Marines left behind were ambushed
During the fight two Marines were hurt and Benson was called again to provide Medevac
The Blackhawk helicopter dispatched to hoist up the wounded Marines was immediately attacked
by the enemy threatening the extraction
The men on the ground did what they could to fight off the enemy attack but they were
outnumbered and the Blackhawks safety turned precarious with every second that passed
It was then when Bensons Kiowa appeared out of nowhere and did the unbelievable for
a light reconnaissance helicopter of its class it began to draw enemy fire away from the
Soon the small helicopters nose was punctured by small arms fire wounding Benson and leaving
his copilot unconscious
Nevertheless Benson did not falter and continued to assist until the Blackhawk safely evacuated
the area
With his aircraft failing and his bestman Adam Stead wounded Benson landed at the nearest
base to save his copilot and his Kiowa
Due to his extreme bravery shown in combat Benson was awarded the American Legion Valor
Award proving that even a small helicopter such as the Kiowa can change the tide of
battle if used properly
The Army officially retired the Kiowa from service in July 2020 after it selected the
Bell 360 Invictus and Sikorskys Raider X as possible replacements for the Future Attack
Reconnaissance Aircraft program
Nevertheless the Kiowa remains in operation with several allied nations across the globe
proving that after more than 50 years of service it continues to excel as a reconnaissance
