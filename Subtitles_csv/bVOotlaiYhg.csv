English
hello everyone
and welcome back to english with lucy
today ive got a very special guest
it is anbu from conquer british english
hello everyone its a pleasure to be
so this is the first part of a twopart
the second part of the lesson is on
anbus channel
the link is in the description box today
were going to be looking at the
between british english and indian
i grew up in bedfordshire in england but
i live in cambridgeshire
and i speak with a modern rp accent
sometimes with a bit of estuary as well
and yeah i actually speak with a similar
accent to lucys
um but during the course of this video
im sure youll be able to hear the
differences there because i actually
grew up in london
and i also have hints of multicultural
london english
and shortened down to emily in my in my
in my accent too
and um just to let you know im of tamil
and we just wanted to also mention you
know india is such a
diverse country and the population is
huge theres over one billion people
living in india
and just to put that in perspective if
you kind of compare india to europe
um just the number of nations in europe
and the languages that they speak
you will notice some differences in in
the indian
english that you use um so wed love to
um whether you use any words slightly
differently and wed love to hear your
thoughts on that in the comments section
yes definitely this is all about
learning and sharing so please do
use that comment section to tell us how
you speak and the words that you use
what id love to do is um give you a
taste of what one form of the indian
accent sounds like in when were
discussing these words so yes
please do so if you give some of the
yeah id love to do that thatd be
really cool cool another important thing
to note
is that ambu has created a pdf for this
with all of the vocabulary differences
and some extra quizzes and interesting
so you can click on the link in the
description box to download that for
videos okay so the first one is
this one its a vegetable yeah
i would call this okra we would call it
ladyfingers thats so funny because
is actually the name of a spongy biscuit
oh really
yes its kind of the bottom layer of a
sometimes do you like do you like the
taste of lady fingers in touring the
i mean the vegetable yeah yeah i love it
honestly i think its quite a boring
biscuit yeah
um i think thats really funny i mean
you can see why its called that cant
but ive um grown up eating okra lady
fingers and its got a very slimy
texture to it
but yeah its using a lot of our dishes
yeah its not something
that we cook with a lot here but we
absolutely love curries
um i think weve actually named the
chicken tikka masala as our national
it was voted as the british national
dish really thats how much we love it
yeah so the next word weve got for you
is this one
brinjal you call it brinjal brinjal
thats so funny i wonder where that
comes from
we call this aubergine but this is quite
a controversial world
yes that too yes
no this is quite a controversial word
because in american english they call it
eggplant and thats it because eggplant
eggplant eggplant
because the flower bud looks like an egg
have you ever oh i didnt ive never
seen it no no
is that one okay we call it aubergine
and brinjal im going to start calling
it brinjal i just like calling it
eggplant i love the accent all right the
next one
is this its the ingredient that makes
up a lot of curries and
i eat it for breakfast a lot um we call
yoghurt in indian english its often
called curd
which is really interesting because kurd
actually has a different meaning i guess
in british english when we imagine curd
yeah do we imagine different consistency
yeah isnt curd like the creamy part of
exactly yeah in indian english you would
often hear phrases like
could you add some curd to my dish or
im just going to pop out and buy some
and not pop out because i guess pop out
saying im going to go to the shops and
buy some curd interesting
but like a dessert yogurt so
strawberryflavored yogurt you wouldnt
say a pot of curd
no i dont think he would know okay yeah
interesting the next one weve got is a
really interesting one because ive
grown up hearing it all the time and
its often been a source of
argument in the household this one is
luck or lack okay yeah
so we dont have a picture for this one
because i need to guess what it is
lark luck like a lark but its not its
not spelled with a
r its spelled l a k h okay
something to do with luck nope something
to do with the bird
it kind of sounds like it right so one
lakh is
a unit in the indian numbering system it
actually represents a hundred thousand
in conversation you might hear someone
say i bought that house
for 10 lakhs so that would be a million
pounds yeah exactly because 10 times 100
000 is 1 million right i just think also
its amazing the way you can switch
between those two acts
thank you so does that is that maybe
rupees are a smaller value
so youre more likely to have something
perhaps because we would
a hundred thousand pounds a lot
yeah that could be that could be a
viable um
reason i think there might be a
difference in the numbering systems as
across across the different nations so
that will
influence how we think about numbers
and then the term that we attribute to a
particular sum of
money or a particular number amazing
because i just would have no idea
if someone yeah told me ten luck in my
household when were talking about
um my parents always use blacks
and my siblings and i we use a hundred
thousand or a million
and we often have miscommunication when
were when were talking about numbers
it leads to a lot of confusion in the
even within your own household yeah all
right this next one
i wonder if you can tell what it is from
the picture
in british english we would refer to
this as marriage
now you would often hear this being
referred to as an alliance
um sounds really formal doesnt it
forming in an artist yes
um but yeah thats often a term that
would you also use marriage as well yeah
for sure
um but in terms of an example sentence
uh someone could say
that these two people are seeking an
alliance or theyre looking for an
thats so funny because i would think
that would be a business person
looking to join forces with someone else
when actually it describes an emotional
connection and an official one as well
let us know if
marriage is often referred to in a
different way
from the part of india that youre from
so uh the next one
is you know when its a rainy day and
you just want to catch that bus youre
going to be waiting at
a bus how would you say it a bus stop
bus stop
in indian english you often hear it as
stand or a bus halt it makes sense
yeah holt is kind of a more formal word
like a more oldfashioned word for stop
british english and then a stand well
you stand there dont you
so yeah and i guess theyre maybe
referring to the actual stand of the
the pole of the bus signs on the top
right the signage if i heard bus stand
id know exactly what is meant by it
but we definitely tend to say bus stop
yeah okay
this next one is the word we use to
a man in a position of authority for
example a teacher
or your boss i mean in british english
we would just say first name terms for
or mr and then their surname for a
i remember mr purdum was my favorite
teacher at school so i would
just call him mr purdum or mr yeah
thats absolutely right
in london ive you know grown up calling
my teachers mr
mr smith for example in india you would
refer to your male teacher as
sir and thats quite common place and
your boss as sir as well
um so with the accent it sounds
something like this
sar so you would hear an indian person
saying saar can you please help me with
the homework please
sorry i was just so in love with what
you were saying i really
really like the accent it is just so
gentle isnt it like
its almost like caressing the r sound
we do use the word sir
we do dont we but i would say for a
boss its too formal thats always
showing too much inequality i would
um but in some schools it depends on the
schools regulations
maybe some private schools places like
that would insist on a more formal code
yeah thats true but i never had to call
my teachers sir at school
um what about female teachers females um
so we so in british english we would say
madden wouldnt in a really formal
setting im just wondering whether sir
madam is used in india because in an
email you would say dear sir madam
in indian english we would refer to a
male teacher as
sir how do you guys refer to your female
teachers at school or your female boss
yeah that would be really interesting to
know because we say miss or mrs
depending if theyre depending on if
theyre married or not
yeah id like to know that the next one
is all about how you refer to members of
our family
so lucy if i was to say that i met up
with my brother
yesterday what how would you understand
that that you met up with your male
my male sibling who is my immediate my
immediate sibling right yes has the same
in indian english brother could also
my male cousin interesting so you do you
use the word cousin still
no so this is why when we speak to
a person whos speaking with british
english we would have to clarify that
and say cousin brother
even though it means cousin you would
often hear
in indian english someone referring to
their cousin as their cousin brother
interesting well we would just say
yeah or cousin sister if it was a female
okay yeah yeah its just the same for us
okay the next one is this
in british english we say boot or car
yeah in indian english we say dickie
so could you put the luggage in the diki
or could you
could you lend me a hand and put the
luggage in there dicky please
awesome and weve also seen a couple of
other spellings for it like
digi as well i guess it just depends on
the pronunciation i guess so as we
mentioned earlier lots of different
indian accents so i guess thats what
influences the spelling there
yeah and um again this is another word
that is also different in american
they call it a trunk they do dont they
ive always imagined an elephant
trunk when i write drunk so they dont
want to put any luggage up there yeah
oh god thats not the first trick ever
so the next one that i wanted to
introduce you to is how we use the word
in our daytoday life okay if i said
current what would you understand that
current is in in the moment that is a
good homophone isnt it um
yes the current for it it is
in the current moment in the current
moment lucy and i are filming
but this version of current is used in
daytoday life
for something else do you want to take
and take a guess
current as in like an ocean current or
electricity current
yes so we use the word current to
electricity i could advise you be
careful of the current lucy
when you are plugging in the plug into
the the socket be careful of the
electricity yes perfect
awesome i never knew that the next one
is a word used to describe
an illness yeah in british english we
diabetes and in indian english you could
hear this being referred to as
sugar and this is commonly used in the
state of tamil nadu
interesting and is this because diabetes
or some forms of diabetes are brought on
excess consumption absolutely absolutely
very interesting and how do you
pronounce it again
so i would pronounce this as sugar so um
do not eat too many sweets because you
could develop sugar
interesting the next one weve got on
the screen in
indian english it could be referred to
as the washroom
but it could also be referred to as the
toilet too
but what about british english well we
also say toilet um i know thats
something that in american english they
find a bit disgusting because its too
specific to the actual toilet
but we say the toilet or the loo thats
i always say the lou i think i heard you
call it
yeah yes i dont think washroom is that
common but thats not to say its never
used in british english
thats right yeah the next one is this
in british english we call it crisps
i know thats quite a hard sound thats
sound crisps
whats what do you call it in indian
english chips its commonly referred to
as chips chips
and what about fried potatoes that are
warm ah also chips
yeah i guess everythings yeah so the
next one weve got here
is referred to as capsicum
now how would you refer to it we would
call this peppers or
red pepper green pepper yellow pepper
but then surely that gets confusing the
kind of the pepper that you put on
your fish and chips yes but then the
pepper we put on
like as a seasoning is an uncountable
so id say can i have some pepper okay
that would be the
the spice or its not necessarily a
spice the seasoning
if i ask for a pepper im asking for a
capsicum that is a fantastic tip
so thats the end of the first part of
