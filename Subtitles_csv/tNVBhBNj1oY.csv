SINGING Looking up at the moonlight lost in time
Do you know what it feels like to leave it all behind?
Look what weve been through yeah Im not over you no
Dont see why you couldnt be real cant read your mind
NONENGLISH SINGING
SINGING Watch our castles crumble washing away
If I get trapped under Ima suffocate
All that weve been through yeah Im not over you no
Broken heart and I couldnt restart I had to run away
