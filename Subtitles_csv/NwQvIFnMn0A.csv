Hello friends!
I will tell you a religious story
and you have to guess the names of the main characters in this story
This is the story of a man
who has a name with the last two letters
being AM
This man had a wife
whose name started with S
The husband and wife were exiled from their city
and they travelled far towards the south
A relative of this man traveled with them
whose name starts with L
On their journey
a king from a faraway kingdom
takes the woman with him
The last letter of the kings name is N
There are many other things in the story
but in short the woman is freed
and escapes from the kings captivity
The man and woman then return
Can you fill in the blanks here?
You can pause the video and think for a few seconds
You might think its an easy question
this is the story of Ramayana
in which the characters are Ram Sita Lakshman and Ravan
But how would it feel if I say that
these fillintheblanks fit in another story
Where our characters are
Abraham Sarah Lot and Pharaoh
This is the story of Prophet Abraham
A common prophet in
Christianity Islam and Judaism
A while ago I made a video on Ramayana
which was liked a lot by you
If you havent seen it
Ill put the link in the description below
You can go and watch it later
So continuing with this religion series
in todays episode lets talk about
Prophet Abraham
Now some of you might have wondered
what was the point of making videos on religions?
That too in todays world
Friends I believe that
looking at todays world
I feel that it is necessary to make videos on religions
Because religion has become something
that is being exploited in terribly
by politicians and media
to spread fear among people
Using religion alone
hatred is being spread among people
And I think videos do  a good job of countering it
The more people from different  religions learn about other religions
the more will we be able to relate to each other
The more love and brotherhood will develop among people
So lets start todays story
which is common in three religions
Many people believe that Prophet Abraham
was the first figure to preach monotheism
Monotheism means to
believe in only one God
Its opposite is polytheism
Polytheism means that you
believe that there are many gods
Monotheists say that there is only one God
These three religions
Christianity Islam and Judaism
are classified as Abrahamic religions
And the word Abrahamic
is derived from Prophet Abraham
Many people believe that
Prophet Abraham was the first prophet
Especially Jews believe this
Many Christians also believe this
But on the other hand some Christians say that
it was not Abraham but Enoch
who was the first prophet
Genesis chapter 5 verse 22 says that
Enoch walked with God for 300 years
Genesis is actually the first book of the Bible
Enoch is said to be a descendant of Adam
And Adam is believed to be the first human being
by the believers of these three religions
Muslims believe that Adam
was the first Prophet
So lets start our story
with the story of Adam and Eve
You must have heard the names
Adam and Eve somewhere
Adam is also called Aadm
And it is believed that God
created him from the soil
God gave him breath
and he became a living being
Throughout this video
I will use different words to refer to God
but they will mean the same entity
because we are talking about monotheism
So irrespective of the word were referring to the one God
In the 1500s there was a very famous painter
He made this historic painting
which can be found in the Vatican City Museum today
He wants to show in this painting
how God created Adam
After creating Adam
he was placed in the Garden of Eden
There were two trees in the garden
The first tree was called the Tree of Life
and the other was called
the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil
God told him to eat whatever he wanted
but not to eat any fruit from the other tree
That was the one condition
Then God thought that
the man would feel very lonely
there should be some helper with him
So after this
God made animals and birds from the soil
But there was no suitable helper
Then God sent Adam to sleep
and when he was sleeping
He took out a bone from his body
and made a woman out of that bone
Adam named this woman Eve
Eve is also called Ava
which means life
One day a snake came
and tried to mislead Eve
into eating forbidden fruit
The tree whose fruits were forbidden by God
the snake said that eating  those fruits would enlighten them
That they will become like God
Tricked by the snake
Eve ate that fruit
and fed it to her husband Adam
And when God came to know about this
He was angry
In anger He curses them
The snake was cursed that
it will keep crawling on his stomach all its life
and will eat dust all its life
The woman was cursed that
she will have to give birth to children
And while giving birth to children
she will have to endure intense labor pains
And Adam was cursed to
having to work for his entire life
He will have to work hard to earn a living
And with this
Adam and Eve were thrown out of the Garden of Eden
And they spend the rest of their lives on Earth
Its a very interesting story
It has been referred to many times
in pop culture movies
One movie that I saw was called Knowing
It is a science fiction movie from 2009
At the end of this movie
Adam and Eve were shown
But if we move ahead in our story
then after thousands of years
the population of humans increases on earth
and God starts looking at humans
And seeing everything God thinks that
humans had become very evil
They were becoming worse
God starts regreting creating humans
Who turned out so evil
He decides to wipe out the whole earth
All the humans animals and birds
He wanted to end all
But in the meantime
there was a good person
Christians call him Noah
and Muslims call him Nuh
So in the eyes of God
Noah was a very good person
So God decided to tell him His plans
He told Noah that
He was going to cause a great flood on earth
A great flood will come
Everything will be wiped out
He told him to make a big boat
He told him to get on the boat
and to bring his wife their three sons and their wives
And apart from this
to bring a male and a female of each living organism
on his ark
And obviously he was asked to take sufficient food with them
for everyone to survive
So God waited for Noah to make this boat ark
and when it was completely built
there was a flood on the entire earth
It rained continuously for 40 days and 40 nights
Everything on Earth was submerged under water
for 150 days
But Noahs Ark was afloat on the water
and the people on it were alive
Finally the boat reached the mountain of Ararat
It was the only dry land
With time the water starts receding
and all the people on this ark
came out and got a new chance to live
I would like to refer to another science fiction film
which had an indirect reference to Noahs Ark
the film 2012
At the end of this film
everything was submerged under water
but some ships were built
in which some people were able to survive
If you notice
many Hollywood films have
parts of the story which
are inspired by religious scriptures
Many of them are direct films
like the film Noah
which is based on this story
But in our story
Noah made an offering to God
He asks God to promise that
He will never destroy life like that again
Now the interesting thing is that
there is a similar story in Hinduism
The story of King Manu
A small fish asks for protection from King Manu
And when the King saved it
the fish kept growing
According to the Puranas
this fish was actually Matsya
an incarnation of Lord Vishnu
This fish tells King Manu
that a big flood was about to come
and everything will be destroyed
And tells him to make a boat to survive
So King Manu built a huge boat
which carried many living creatures  plants and Saptarishis
And when the great flood came
they could survive because of the boat
And the Matsya awatar
guided them safely to the Himalayas
Now another mindblowing thing is that
in the ancient civilization of Mesopotamia
there is a similar story written in the scriptures found there
The Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh
Here a great sage Utnapishtim was warned
about a great flood
and he saved his relatives
living creatures and food in a huge boat
Not only that in Greek mythology
due to the anger of God Zeus
a great flood comes
Deucalion was warned about this flood
by his father Prometheus
Deucalion and his wife built a boat
to escape the flood
Moving on with the story
we come to Abram
There is a famous story of Abram
when he broke the idols
This story is not mentioned in the Hebrew Bible
but it is mentioned in Midrash Genesis Rabbah chapter 38
Midrash is basically a commentary on the Bible
by a Jewish Rabbi
We will find this story
in chapter 21 verses 5170 of the Quran
with some differences
The basic story is that
it was the era when people used to worship idols
Abrams father Terah
was a man who made the idols
And worshipped them
One day Abrams father went on a trip far away
and left Abram in charge of his shop
A man came to the shop to buy an idol
Abram asks him for his age
50 years said the man
50 years? said Abram
Abram said that a 50 years old man
would be worshipping an idol which is not even older than 1 year
Hearing this the man was embarrassed
and left the shop
On another occasion when no other person was present
Abram picked up a stick
and broke all the idols
And then he placed that stick in the hands of the biggest idol
When people return they were shocked
Some say that Abram must have done it
because he always criticised worshipping idols
They asked Abram why he did it
Abram replied that the idols were actually fighting with each other
And that the biggest idol
picked up the stick and broke all the smaller idols
Abram told the people to ask the biggest idol
why he broke the others
People called out his bluff
They said that the idols cannot fight with each other
Neither can they speak
So Abrams asked
Why do you worship these idols
when these statues cannot speak or do anything?
You will not gain anything from it
nor will you suffer any loss from it
Abram was ordered to go into a big fire
And if Abram was right
the real God will save him
So Abram went into that fire
and God saved him
Because of this story
idols are not worshipped
in Judaism and Islam
And some conservative Muslims
in fact some conservative Hindus also say that
because Hindus worship idols
Hindus are Kafirs for Muslims
How true is this?
If you look closely
Hindus dont worship idols
They worship God through the idol
Its like you remember your father
by looking at his photo
You remember your father through the photo
and show him your love
But it doesnt mean that
you forget your actual father
and start showing love only to this physical photo
and start remembering the photo
Similarly every Hindu knows that
God is being worshipped through the idols
The physical idol is not being actually worshipped
Acharya Prashanth gave a good answer to this
when I spoke to him
The idol has been a successful experiment
The idol has been a good means to reach the formless
And when the idol is worshipped
it is never said that the idol is the true God
It is said that I will use this idol
to reach the true God
I will use the idol to
reach the formless
Even Christians do not consider this to be wrong
This is the reason why
you will find Jesus and Marys idols in many churches
Many passages are cited by them
to prove this
Chapter 20 verse 4 and 5 in Exodus of the Hebrew Bible
it is written that God has forbidden  to make idols of any other thing
He has forbidden bowing down before idols
It should be noted that
it is not Gods idols
it is forbidden to bow down before idols of other things
Now lets move 5 chapters ahead
Chapter 25 verse 17 to 22 says
God himself commands Prophet Moses
to make a mercy seat of pure gold
To make idols of Cherub on both sides
God says that he will speak to Moses
from among these statues
This is not the only example
Another book Hebrew Bible Ezekiel
chapter 41 verse 25
Read the description of the Temple of Jerusalem
There were carvings of cherub  and palm trees on the doors and walls
So it doesnt seem like God
has a problem with us using his photos
or making his idols
As long as we use those things
to worship God
Not to worship those idols or photos
Quran Surah 4 Ayat 48
is often quoted
as the quote to show that
Quran is against making idols
Here too we see that
Do not associate partners with God
That is dont worship anyone other than God
This sentiment is seen in Chapter 31 Ayat 13 of the Quran
Worship only God
So to say that all Muslims
consider all nonMuslims to be Kafirs
is a wrong notion
The people who want to spread hatred
are the ones who spread such misinformation
The meaning of the word Islam
is Submission before God
Submitting before God
And the meaning of the word Muslim
is the one who submits before God
That is why from the perspective of a liberal Muslim
any person who believes in any religion
is a Muslim
Because in his religion
whatever name he has given to God
he is worshipping the God
and submitting to him
This is not my personal opinion
this is how it is
Even at that time
there were many other religions in Arabia
If you see chapter 2 verse 62 of the Quran
it says that Jews Christians and Sabians
were counted among the believers
These were the people who believed in God
It mentions fighting
only those people
who believe an idol to be God
Around 600 AD
there was a tribe called the Quraysh tribe
They lived in the region of Saudi Arabia
They believed that their central god
was Hubal
Which was actually an idol
made of stone
and whose right hand was broken
Quraysh tribe replaced its right hand
with a golden hand
With a hand made of gold
Now this idol was actually broken
by Prophet Muhammad in 630 AD
Dont confuse mythological stories and actual history
What I just told you is actual proven history
And the stories before that
were mythological and biblical stories
If we talk about ancient Egyptians
they worshipped the jackal gods
Like Anubis and Wepwawet
And apart from stone idols
another type of idol worship has been mentioned in the Quran
To idolize something
Like in chapter 18 verse 32 to verse 46
a warning has been given
Dont idolize your property or wealth
Dont worship your wealth
In chapter 25 it has also been said that
people often turn their desire their ego
into God
And you will find the same warning in Hinduism
In Hinduism even though we get to see different forms of God
we get to see different avatars of God
but in Bhagavad Gita chapter 10 it is mentioned that
Lord Krishna is saying
By the way if you want to understand Bhagwat Gita better
I would suggest this audiobook on KUKU FM
Shreemad Bhagwat Gita Samasyao Ka Samadhan in Hindi
It is a long audiobook
With more than 25 hours of content
But its been broken down into small chapters of 810 minutes

Do check it out
And not just in Gita
but we get to see mention of monotheism
in Rigveda Mandal 1 Shlok 46
The Rishi is called by many names
Agni Yam Indra Varun
Look at Chapter 32 of Yajurveda
It is written that He is Agni
Aditya which is Sun
He is Vayu Chandrama Jal
There is no one like him
His name is great
He is in all beings
Before him there was nothing
All people have been created by that God
Similarly if we talk about the other meaning
then in the texts of different religions
whether it is Hinduism Buddhism or Christianity
it is mentioned in the scriptures
to never idolize your ego
To never worship your material desires or wealth
So you can see how these things mentioned in different religions
align with each other
How similar these religions are to each other fundamentally
But one thing is worth mentioning
Even though in Islam Christianity or Judaism
the people of other religions are not kafirs
but atheists are definitely kafirs
People who dont believe in any god
are definitely called kafirs
Why am I saying this?
Because the word kafir means the same thing
Kufr means disbelief
and kafir means one who disbelieves in God
A person who doesnt believe in God
But does this mean that
we should kill all the nonbelievers?
There are only two ways people can say such things to you
First psychopaths
The terrorists who actually want to kill people
And second people who spread WhatsApp propaganda
who want to instil fear in people
What is actually written in religious scriptures?
Quran chapter 9 verse 5 says
Kill the Mushrik
meaning disbelievers
wherever you find them
You will find such lines in many religious scriptures
Hebrew Bible Book 1 Samuel Chapter 15
conveys the message of God to Saul
Now go attack the Amalekites
and totally destroy everything that belongs to them
Do not spare them
In Christianity Gospel of Mattew Chapter 10 Verses 3436
Jesus tells his disciples
Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth
I did not come to bring peace
but a sword
Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2 Shloka 31 to 38
Lord Krishna tells Arjun
Happy are the Kshatriyas
the warriors to whom such fighting opportunities come unsought
opening for them the doors of the heavenly planets
Such calls for violence can be found in almost every religious scripture
If I start explaining all of it
it will be a long video
But in short all these lines of scriptures
are very heavily contextual
If you read it out of context you will feel that
it is true that they are promoting violence
But if you read it in context you will understand
the context it is being discussed in
For example when Lord Krishna tells Arjun
he says that when the Mahabharata war was going on
when Prophet Muhammad tells his followers
it is being said
in the context of the fight with Quraysh tribe
The same thing is applicable in the case of Samuel
And the line of Jesus here
has a metaphorical meaning
Actually in any scripture it is not said that
one should go and start killing innocent people
It is another thing that
the terrorists and orthodox people in every religion
deliberately misinterpret these religion scriptures
And present them in such a way that
people are influenced to do violence
People start to hate
In our country we see such great Islamic scholars
like Wahiduddin Khan
who was awarded the Padma Vibhushan award
by the Indian government in 2021
He says that Islam is the religion of peace and tolerance
He conveys this message to people
And on the other hand there are people like
terrorist Osama Bin Laden
who brainwash people by saying that
Islam tells you to kill
Similarly if you learn Hinduism from the right scholars
you will learn love and affection
But if you listen to the evil people
they will misrepresent these verses of the Gita in a way that
will force you to take up arms
Nowhere is it written that religion demands violence
And you should be alerted of this
that there is a centralized conspiracy unit
that is plotting such conspiracies
of using something that is not even written in the scriptures
by writing it in Sanskrit
and spreading it through WhatsApp and other sources
Now lets talk about the 4th story of Abram
which I talked about at the beginning of the video
The same story which was
quite similar to the Ramayana
But if you go into the details
it is not that similar
It is just a coincidence
that there were so many similarities
In this story God told Abram
to leave his home
and go in search of a place
that God is going to show him
Abram his wife Sarai
and his nephew Lot
leave their home
It was by chance that Abram
was very similar to Ram
Sarai to Sita  and Lot to Lakshman
They go to many places
and finally take turn towards Egypt
to escape a famine
When they were about to enter Egypt
Abram tells his wife
I know how beautiful you are
When the Egyptians see you
they will see that you are my wife
and they might kill me
While keeping you alive
But if we say that you are not my wife
but my sister
then they will treat me well
and my life will be saved
The kings of Egypt at that time were known as Pharaohs
The Pharaohs officials saw Sarai
praise her and take her to their palace
Because Abram said that he was her brother
Abram gets good treatment
and Abram was given many sheep
cattle donkeys servants and camels
But suddenly Pharaohs house
was hit by a lot of serious diseases
So Pharaoh suddenly calls Abram
and asks What have you done to me?
Why didnt you tell me that she was your wife?
Why did you say that she was your sister?
I had made her my wife
But now take your wife and go back
So on Pharaohs orders
Abram and his wife and whatever they had
were sent out of Egypt
After this Abram went to Negev and Bethel
and the shepherds of Abram and Lot
start fighting with each other
So Abram and Lot
went their separate ways
At this point Abram lived on the land of Canaan
Abram and Sarai did not have a child
Sarai gave Abram her slave woman Hagar
and a child was born
and he was named Ishmael
God makes an agreement with Abram
that he would be the father of many nations
Because of this God renamed Abram
and names him Abraham
This is the reason why I was
calling Abraham as Abram
Because it was only after this story
that Abram was named Abraham
and Sarai was named Sarah
God promised Abraham
all the land of Canaan
And what is the description of Canaan exactly?
These are the places that range from
the valley of Egypt
to the Euphrates River
That is the presentday Israel
West Bank Gaza Jordan
and Syria and Lebanons southern areas
They were all part of this land
All of this is considered to be a part of this land
What is the connection with actual history?
When the Zionist movement started in Israel
the Zionists said that
the land promised by God
was for the Jews
So when Jews were prosecuted in Europe for centuries
they moved here in 1900 after that
Moving forward in the story
God promised Sarah
that He will give her a son
And then Isaac is born
By this time the child Ishmael
did not have a good attitude
So Sarah told Abraham
to send him away
Abraham hesitates whether or not
to send his son away
But when he asks God
God told him to send Ishmael away
The slave woman Hagar
went with her son Ishmael to the desert
God arranged water for them
and promised Hagar that
one day her son will make a great nation
Jews and Christians believe that
they are the descendants of Isaac
And Muslims believe that
they are the descendants of Ishmael
This is the point of the story
from which these Abrahamic religions
separate from each other
Jews believe that Isaac had a son named Jacob
Who was later renamed Israel
And that Israel was actually the ancestor
of 12 tribes of Israel
Thats why today all the Jews believe that
they are actually the descendants
of Isaacs son Jacob
On the other hand in Christianity
Jesus is the most important prophet
Christians believe that Jesus
is actually the descendant of Isaac
And because they believe in Jesus
they consider themselves a spiritual descendant of Isaac
Third Muslims believe that
Abraham and Ishmael together
built the Kaaba in Mecca
which is the most sacred site of Islam
Thats why Muslims trace back
their spiritual lineage to Ishmael
So these were some interesting stories
about these three Abrahamic religions
You can comment below whether you liked them or not
If you liked them
what other religious videos would you like to see?
There are many stories to tell
The story of Prophet Joseph
the story of Moses
the Ten Commandments
and the conquest of Canaan by Joshua
And then fastforwarding to the
storied of Prophet Jesus and Prophet Muhammad
And apart from this there are other religions
like Buddhism Jainism and Zoroastrianism
On which religion would you want the next video to be?
