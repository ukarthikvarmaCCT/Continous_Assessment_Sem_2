guys this is our third episode
For unboxing the merchandise of your favorite youtubers sold by them
Here i have the overlays box
Since I started unboxing on this channel
many people commented things like these
i speak in tech burners style
i talk like a tech burner
Dont copy tech burner
And one person keeps commenting on each video
Tech burners of men fashion
but on a true note your any comment does not hurt me
bcoz if you attach gangadhar with truth
then it will become shaktiman only
its a compliment!
in the box of overlays you will get its brand name on the top
thier logo!
with the website name!
here its written Unbox the desire
nothing else
The box is made of cardboard
looks like a very sustainable material
afterwards you can use at is as a gift wrap for your relatives
After you open the box you get to see burnt hakka noodles
a card from team overlays and the rest you can read over here
you get a tag of overlays on the tshirt with a piece of paper that is cut and stuck on
the colour of the tshirt is white with no design its a solid tshirt
now lets talk about the fabric because this is the only thing that makes this tshirt
the fabric is cotton and is known as waffled textured cotton
this means that the entire body of the tshirt is made like waffles
if you have eaten a waffle or not it looks like this
the pattern is like this
similarly the pattern is made
The first thing is that it is very breathable
literally if you look like this you have got many seethrough holes
this makes a lot of air to come in and makes you comfortable
you can use it as a channi for karwachauth also when your spouse dont get a channi!
your karwachauth will be complete!
this tshirt is very stretchable bringing squeeziness inside your body
the cloth grabs your body
out of hundred things the cloth looks definitely premium
looking down you get a patch of brand overlays
i found 2 to 3 things missing in this tshirt which i will tell you later on
talking about the look it is white suits for very occassion time and season
just looks perfect!
so here we have the next tshirt!
if you remember overlays first launch!
in that overlays
hypily the word supima cotton usage was used
worlds finest cotton was being used
so continuing that thing these fabrics are also designed in the same way
that waffle one was not the supima cotton
first of all if you purchase this tshirt the first thing you will feel is the weight
of this tshirt
compared to other tshirts which you shop around from other brands
the t shirt is very heavy and the thickness of
and the quaity of the cloth is very nice
the same tag is present over here
The name of the tshirt is a variant white and black oversized tshirt
the price written over here is 1699 which means 1700 is the mrp
it is sold nearby to thousand rupees
it is also a full white t shirt in the front
but the designing in the corners and at the neck area is made of black
which is a stripped design
but can you tell whom you remember by looking at this tshirt?
the only thing is the middle design is shifted to the corner design
overall it looks like a benten tshirt only
down you get the branding of overlays which is attached through a rubber patch
in the neck area you get one more overlays tag attached with L size written
sings song
talking about the t shirt one thing that increases the level of experience is
the fabric of the tshirt is thick and is very dense
in this tshirt 230 is used
if you dont know what is this?
basically the thickness of the fabric is measured
to check the thickness of the fabric so in this tshirt the fabric thickness is
so in this 230 gsm is used and literally
the premium texture will be felt by you
the fabric is very stretchy inspite of being cotton
stretches like elastic
if you want to know my reviews on this tshirt then you will have to watch the video till
the end
now lets move to the next amazing tshirt
so here we have the tshirt
you must have watched people wearing the same tshirt
The name of the tshirt is messed it!
which means a mess is created!
we get a tag of overlays
mrp is 1599 but you have to very less amount if the product will be left or not
this tshirt is oversized and come with a design of multiple patch work
with multiple colours in it
one side you will have a lot of dark grey
another side little bit of cream color
another side is the blue color
the neckline is black in colour
not only with the difference in colour patches but you get different fabric material with
each color
the whole tshirt is from supima but the texture and feeling is different from one another
the 4 patches you see over here is
this dedicates to any sign of space
its that alien which tried to communicate with others
who threw the stone?
down you have the branding of overlays
at the back of the neck we have the overlays branding
the next thing you will notice is
that not only through the colour it is made but the fabrics are properly cut and stitched
to make this tshirt
definitely it took a lot of work for sure
the grey part you see here
these fabrics is made at 230 gsm
moreover the texture is a little bit rough according to me
if you have to wear comfy wear then these blue and cream part feels the same
t shirt is very good very comfortable and nice fitting and is a oversized tshirt
it matches with the trend indeed
lets move to the next tshirt!
we bought 5 tshirts and here we have another box with burnt hakka noodles in it
we talked to the team of overlays clothing at their old launch
but dont know what happened after that but this is not a sponsored video
i have purchased all these products with my own money so that i show you
and i get to experience about everything
this white tshirtb which you saw at the beginning
with the same design the same cloth and the same waffle fabric
the only thing is it has different elements
In the front we have a pocket with a thread design on the sides
The colour of the thread is grey with the same grey neckline with more thread designs
at the back
at the end of the sleeves you have grey borders
and this tshirt is designed as an oversized fit
the name of the tshirt is a white waffle oversized tshirt with olive rib
the team says it is as an olive green tshirt but it looks grey to me and us
maybe it has some magic inside
the mrp of this tshirt is 1399 but you dont have to pay this much
i dont have more to say about this tshirt if we talk about looks?
again its a very fine tshirt the broll will tell you how am i looking in this tshirt
next we move to the last tshirt!
by the grace of the god we will also do such things one day!
lets open the next tshirt the name of the tshirt is
its a full black tshirt
with some grey design in the middle
about that i will explain
lets talk about the price the price written here is 1399 which you dont have to pay
tag with overlays branding
inside you have a patch of overlays down you have one more small patch
this tshirt is also made of supima fabrics
definitely the thickness its the same very good
and this tshirt is made at 222
222 gsm made
it has a round neck and short sleeves
you dont get a lot of design in it
a runway sort of thing is made on the tshirt and some strokes on the sleeve is made
thus this is a small design element which looks cool
these tshirts speak more of the quality and not the designs
might happen you dont like the design on the website but when you
touch it you will feel a different experience
that you never have hold such a piece of cloth neither wore it
if you loved watching these tshirts then you can like it and go
lets talk about the pros and cons
pros is the cloth of these tshirts are of very good quality
and literally any youtuber or any website will never serve these premium clothes
from packaging to the clothes there were no use of plastic
i found that  a very good thing!
lets talk about the cons
now all the cons i will be talking about is
they are not cons but improvements
which the company can hear as a customer advice
about what they can improve and what not?
the first problem which i found was
that in any cloth among these 5 there is no instructions given about
the fabric like the type of fabric? is that supima or anything else?
the second thing was the body fitting was good but
but the sleeves were not so flattering and looks as if they were running
if i have wore this tshirt and the sleeve is running
then this thing personally does not looks good
the tshirt mounting freely doesnt look nice
