Hello friends!
A child deprived of his fathers love
either due to his fathers absence
or excessively strict upbringing
It leads to the child developing psychological issues
evolving into severe problems  as the child reaches adulthood
This isnt a fictional narrative
numerous research papers have proved these claims
Studies consistently indicate
that a fathers absence  diminishes a childs selfconfidence
Other studies show that harsh parenting
excessive strictness while growing up
is linked to the development  of aggressive behaviour in children
Youd think that harsh parenting is very common
how can it be so bad?
Id say look around you
Low selfconfidence and  aggression are common traits in people
not only this several research papers show that
the absence of a caring father
can be a contributing factor  in someone becoming a criminal
Imagine if someone were to  make a film on such a sensitive topic
well you dont need to imagine it
a cinematic masterpiece already exists
no Im not talking about the one youre thinking
I meant The White Ribbon
The White Ribbon film was  honoured with the Best Film Award
at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival
as well as the International Critics Prize
Best Film at the European Film Awards
over 10 German Film Awards
and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film
India too boasts remarkable films on this sensitive topic
such as Govind Nihalanis Ardh Satya
I dont care about what you want
Am I your wife?
I live how I want to live
I do not bow down to someone elses whims
You better not forget that
Similarly Vikramaditya Motwanes Udaan
If he wants to live in my house
eat and wear what I earn
he has to live like I want him to
But I dont want to work in the factory
Did anyone ask your opinion?
There are some beautifully  written famous songs on this issue
such as this
The lyrics emphasise that
though people know how to have children
but they struggle with becoming a father
Now consider the scenario this sensitive concept
is picked up by an insensitive director
with a track record of regressive and  misogynistic films such as Kabir Singh
what will happen then?
Unfortunately we dont need to merely speculate
be it would result in this film Animal
While Bollywood has produced  its fair share of subpar films
this particular one stands out
To me this seems like a cringefest
which will prove to be cncerous for our society
Some may instantly dismiss this critique
as an exaggeration
arguing that its just a film
and theres no need to be overly woke
Additionally comparisons are  drawn to other violent films
like Gangs of Wasseypur  Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction
that are not criticised as much
And that watching violence in films  doesnt drive one to violent behaviour
The director of a film brings their individual morality
and subjective opinions into the narrative
Labelling a film as a cringefest cncer may seem too harsh
I merely ask you to hear me out
I promise to delve into a detailed explanation in this video
Not only about the problematic elements in the film
but also the broader societal issues
touching on topics such as alpha males and feminism
Friends I am sure you remember  the Nirbhaya case from 2012
That had shocked the entire nation
During that time Madhumita Pandey  a Clinical Psychology Masters student
embarked on a quest
to understand the motivations behind such heinous acts
To look for the answers to this
she decided to talk to the individuals who committed such acts
She wanted to survey the prisoners of Tihar jail
Eventually she interviewed 122 convicted rpists
and 65 convicted mrd3rers in Tihar jail
A stark difference emerged in their responses
most mrd3rers expressed some  level of regret for their actions
they regretted destroying multiple lives
Some regretted their actions more than others
but most of the mrd3rers  felt some degree of regret
But when she talked to the convicted rpists
many exhibited a lack of regret
they felt no remorse
This was consistent with the documentary
Indias Daughter which  focused on the Nirbhaya case
When interviewing the rpists
the assailant justified his actions
by questioning why the victim was  out late at night with her boyfriend
expressing a desire to teach her a lesson
Notably it was clear throughout the interview
that he felt no ounce of regret for his actions
Observing this pattern  Madhumita sought to understand
the underlying reasons behind  the lack of regret among rpists
Why do they show no signs of remorse?
She gave them two questionnaires
the MMIS  Multicultural Masculinity Ideology Scale
and an Attitude Towards Women Test
The results indicated that
these individuals held  highly regressive views about women
reflecting backward thinking
Madhumita wasnt the only one to research this
Many such research have  been conducted outside India too
such as Susan Brownmillers 1975 book
Against Our Will Men Women and Rpe
emphasized the same points
In her book she wrote that rpe
is a form of intimidation
often driven by a desire to assert power
and dominance over women
Other researchers including Richard Johnson
Danielle Cusmano and Rebecca Whisnant
came to the same conclusion
Rpe is not driven by a
an unrestrained desire to fornicate
Rather there are three main motives driving rpists
a need to display their power
an outlet for anger
and sadistic cruelty
However a common thread among these motives
is the perpetrators belief in the inferiority of women
This prompts the question
where does this regressive thinking originate?
The answer is Everywhere
Theres a saying that holds true here
A man is the product of his environment
It means that a persons  behaviour personality and identity
are moulded by their surroundings
These factors include everything
the way their parents care for them
their interactions with relatives
experiences in school  with teachers and friends
and exposure to their surrounding environment
Additionally mass media plays a major role in this
Things that are in the news books radio TV ads
social media content songs and movies
significantly influences the formation  of a persons identity and behaviour
Some aspects of your life are within your conscious control
such as what you choose to read or watch
However everything has a  subconscious effect on your mind
that you may not immediately recognize
Some may argue against this by
pointing out that they watch gangster movies
without becoming gangsters themselves
Sandeep Vanga Reddy the director of this film
made a similar argument in an interview
when Anupama Chopra asked him about  the societal impact of films like Kabir Singh
He compared it to watching gangster movies
without becoming a gangster consequently
I grew up watching Gyang Leader
Parinda Ram Lakhan Tezaab
me and my brother never became  gangsters after watching Parinda
This is the same argument that some people use
when justifying eating deepfried food
that are known to increase  the risk of a heart attack
and increasing cholesterol levels
using the argument that they are  still alive and havent suffered a heart attack
The point is having one unhealthy  meal may not cause a heart attack
but if you keep having deepfried food  for days and weeks and years
you may suffer a heart attack someday
And you will always be at an  increased risk of getting a heart attack
Similarly if someone says that they  worked out in the gym for an hour
but havent lost weight yet
we need to remember that  changes are made in small increments
Each droplet adds up to create the ocean
The same can be said about films
Watching one gangster film doesnt make a person a gangster
Nor does watching one good film make a person a great person
But the small incremental changes that  they have on the psyche of the viewers
adds up throughout their lives
Whether it is positive or negative
In the weight loss video  I discussed the multiple factors
including diet exercise sleep and stress management
I pointed out that effective weight  loss is a combination of all these factors
Similarly if everything goes well in a childs life
he has parents who care for him
teachers who treat him well
good friends
he reads good books
he is educated thinks logically
and uses his intellect in every aspect of his life
watching one problematic film wouldnt affect him
However consider the opposite scenario
a boy named Munnu
growing up in a household with  his father beating his mother
restrictive rules for his sister  that arent applicable on him
on YouTube Munnu follows those  YouTubers who objectify women
Saying that women arent capable of thought
And that their only role is to do household chores
On Instagram Munnu follows creators like Andrew Tate
the symbol of toxic masculinity and misogyny
He sees him saying the same stuff
Moreover when Munnu listens to songs
he encounters the same  objectification of women in the lyrics
I am a tandoori chicken
eat me with alcohol
Honey Singhs songs
Have you ever paid attention to their lyrics?
I am a womanizer
Dont meet me alone
I dont hold a girl with silicone
I dont fall in love with a brown girl
I am a lion
I dont graze
You know I am a hunter
I will eat you whole
Even repeating these lyrics feels unsettling
UNICEF has highlighted a report by  American Psychological Association
on how such objectification in mass media
contributes to violence against women
At home Munnu is exposed to news channels
he hears politicians expressing views that
boys are bound to make mistakes
girls shouldnt wear revealing clothes
girls shouldnt be out at night
Television ads also contribute to this  narrative of womens objectification
For instance a perfume ad may depict a girl
hearing four boys taking a shot each
she gets scared by this
only to reveal they were talking about perfume
To make matters worse
when Munnu goes to watch a film in theatres
he watches films like Animal
In this movie the protagonist  twisted his wifes arm violently
grabs her neck
and pointing a gun at her
Some argue that such actions are justified
because the wife slapped him
This is the key issue!
Why should violence regardless of  the gender involved be glorified?
According to Sandeep Vanga
love is not genuine unless you can hit your partner
Im not kidding
Sandeep Vanga had said this  without any sarcasm in an interview
When you are deeply in love
if you dont have the liberty of slapping each other
then I dont see anything there
In the film the protagonist Rannvijay commits numerous mass mrd3rs
yet his wife Geetanjali never even thinks to leave him
However when he has an extramarital affair
she encourages him to kll the other woman
Are you crazy?
You need treatment
Despite being portrayed as a father of a daughter
he mocks the discomfort of menstruation
He tells his wife that this is a mans world
He tells his lover to lick his shoe  to prove that she loves him
The film portrays this character as someone with daddy issues
lacking his fathers love
However Ranvijay exhibits the same  neglect towards his own children
Such behaviours might have been somewhat justified
had the film depicted him as mentally ill
and later undergoing a positive transformation
But that was not to be
There was no redemption at the end of the film
Ranbir Kapoors acting fails to  convey any sense of mental illness
causing the misogyny and  toxic masculinity to be glorified
The protagonist of the film
does all of this with the utmost confidence
Almost like an alpha male
Munnus entire environment is  steeped in regressive views
pervasive objectification of women  and mistreatment of women
Despite this people say  how much damage can one film cause?
Though one film doesnt turn people bad
its part of the toxic environment that we are living in
Such films ensure that the environment remains toxic
Thats why I say that movies like Animal
are cncerous to our society
This was evident on the films poster
Featuring the hero promoting cancer by smoking
what else could one expect?
On the same day Animal was released
another film hit the cinemas
Sam Bahadur
centred around Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw
look at the stark contrast  between the heroes of the two films
Sam Bahadur a reallife hero
who fought for the country and humanity
He played a pivotal role in preventing  a horrific genocide in Bangladesh
Should people like Sam Bahadur be the symbols of masculinity?
Or characters like Kabir Singh and Rannvijay?
For those interested in learning more about his life

Now lets get back to the topic at hand
Lets delve into the narrative of this film
Years ago Mario Puzo authored  a novel titled The Godfather
Famous director Francis Ford Coppola
adapted this novel into a  highly successful trilogy of films
Since then numerous Indian films have copied it
such as Dharmatma Nayakan Dayawan
Aatank Hi Aatank Sarkar
Malik and now Animal
The extent of originality or imitation in this film  is something you can discern for yourself
In The Godfather the plot  revolves around a gangster named Vito
who oversees a vast business empire
His younger son Michael resides abroad in America
However when an assassination attempt is made on Vitos life
Michael returns and
joins the gang
He discovers that the traitor was  his sisters husband Carlo
so he gets Carlo klled
And then he starts getting into conflicts with rival gangs
The Godfather belongs to the gangster genre
but Sandeep Vanga Reddy opted
to make a film that would make millions at the box office
So he copied the concept of his earlier film Kabir Singh
To have a protagonist who would be the antihero
a shorttempered quicktoanger alpha male
who smokes excessively
projecting an image of coolness
And since he knows that showing violence  in the film would draw in more crowds
he decided to heighten the violence
emphasizing bloodshed
During an interview with Anupama Chopra Sandeep expressed
his intent to make his next film even more violent
than Kabir Singh
aiming to push the boundaries of violence in cinema
It will be more
because these guys are calling this a violent film
I want to tell them
Ill show them what a violent film will be
Once Animal was released
his fans enthusiastically share this clip
as a testament to Sandeeps knack for making violent films
Interestingly fans of such films often exhibit a unique characteristic
you would have noticed that
such films draw in the most number of toxic fans
While Bollywood has seen its fair share of mediocre releases
recent films like Tejas Shehzada
or Ranbir Kapoors last film Shamshera
These films were negatively reviewed
audience criticised them extensively
but was anyone offended by this criticism?
No one was triggered
However when films like Kabir Singh and Animal are criticised
some people find it hard to control their outrage
Film critic Sucharita Tyagi for instance  remarked that the film is not entertaining
And the fans of this film resorted to abusing her on Twitter
Why does this happen?
Because some individuals find validation in toxic films
When these films receive criticism
their fans feel that their own personality is being criticised
and their validation is being taken away
However the underlying reason for  the excessive bloodshed in such films
to be completely honest is that violence sells
As Aamir Khan aptly noted
as you can see in this clip
Directors who are not very talented creatively
in creating a story
in showing emotions in creating situations
they depend heavily on violence and sx
to make their films work
This isnt limited to Bollywood
it is equally applicable to Hollywood
This is a new genre of films
known as Slasher films or Gore films
Imagine a conversation between two friends
talking about a new Gore film
Filled with violence and bloodshed
and they plan to watch it
because it will be fun!
It will be fun to watch some broken skulls
someone getting stabbed
it would enliven their evening
Friends there is a psychological reason why
some people love watching extreme  violence and bloodshed on screen
Typically in their lives these individuals
feel powerless and repressed
Oppressed by someone else
Those suppressed by authority figures  whether its a boss
a policeman or even parents at home
people like these are drawn to such gory and violent films
In the theatre they can envision  themselves as the protagonist
finding satisfaction in the violent that  is directed towards someone else
In Animal this violence and  bloodlust is taken to an extreme level
The protagonist doesnt just sht the enemy
he goes on to strngle someone with his bare hands
or slice another persons throat with a knife
Such characters if encountered in real life  would be labelled as psychopaths
The directors glamorize these scenes
presenting them in a stylish manner
resulting in a 15minutelong continuous sequence showcasing bloodshed
Someone aptly tweeted about this film
This film is for the animals  of the animals and by the animals
Ordinarily a person would look at such characters
and understand that they are  psychologically troubled or mentally ill
However when this character seeks help  from a psychotherapist in the film
this point is dismissed
No need to waste the audiences time with such seriousness
there needs to be continuous scenes depicting bloodshed
As Aamir Khan pointed out
cheap directors have nothing else to show
so they keep showing these scenes  to make as much money as possible
Because the truth is
films can portray violence
without glamorizing it
instead of showing it in a stylish way
presenting a realistic depiction
that highlights the negative impact on society
However such realistic films  often struggle at the box office
Some great examples are Anurag Kashyaps works
like Ugly That Girl in Yellow Boots
and Almost Pyaar with DJ Mohabbat
these films offer a social commentary
but people dont want to watch  violence being inflicted by the villain
They find it disturbing and repulsive
There are so many problems in the world already
so why should they watch more violence in cinema halls?
Because the villain inflicting violence fills you with disgust
You are repelled by that violence
you hate watching every moment of such scenes
While this aversion to violence is commendable
no one should be drawn to violence
but the audiences repressed self seeks entertainment
craving violence from the heros standpoint
You want to imagine yourself as James Bond or Kill Bill
or this character from Animal
Directors and producers understand this
they capitalize on this demand
flooding the market with violent action films
Consequently almost all of the recent bigbudget films
heavily feature action and violence
In a review of the film Animal a critic remarked
we have moved passed familyoriented films like Hum Sath Sath Hai
the audience now craves Animal
This is disheartening because Hum Sath Sath Hai
is a heartwarming family drama inspired by the Ramayana
It is a film suitable for the entire family
delivering positive messages to society and  reaching the heart in a way that fosters unity
In the Ramayana video I discussed the virtues of Lord Ram
highlighting qualities like humility compassion
despite being fit and strong
Such a man should be the ideal model  of masculinity for our society
However some individuals reject such models
because they lack compassion and empathy themselves
A human with no companssion
is an animal not a human
Literally an animal
Characters like Kabir Singh and Rannvijay  in Sandeep Vangas film
exemplify a lack of selfcontrol
Kabir Singh indulges in drinking and consuming drugs
while Rannvijay resorts to shouting beating
and even threatening his wife with a gun when angered
Can such characters truly serve as role models?
Those who appreciate such regressive characters
used to call themselves Macho Man until recently
However in the past few years a new term  has popped up on social media for such people
Alpha Male
They call themselves Alpha Male
If you are sensible you will stay away  from such a destructive way of thinking
Stop watching such films
Our minds are not dustbins
we should respect our minds
If you have friends who enjoy such films
consider sharing this video with them to illustrate
how these films are like a cncer to our society
If you found this video insightful
you can click here to watch the Ramayan video
youd like that too
Thank you very much!
