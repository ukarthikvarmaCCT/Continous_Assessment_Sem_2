Hi guys and welcome to French Guy Cooking
Today  an explosion of indian tangy flavors trapped in the most reassuring english Tradition
Plus !
Ill bring you the most undisputable proof that you have the power to work miracles
Lets make the unexpected but stunning Palak Paneer Hinglish Pie
You are about to make your own cheese
How you feel about it ?
The Paneer cheese is insanely fast and dead simple to make
Paneer is a fresh cheese quite common in India
It is made by curdling heated milk with an acidic liquid
It tastes quite soft but it is milky and nutty
In a big pan over medium high heat pour 2 liters of whole milk and 1 cup of cream
Stir it from time to time
When there is serious foam forming
Remove the milk form the heat and add half a cup of apple cider vinegar
This is where things get exciting !
The reaction just takes a few minutes
The milk will separate into curds and whey
Now get yourself a piece of cloth
This can be called a cheesecloth or a muslin
Just take whatever cloth you find
Place the cloth in a strainer over the sink
Pour the liquid in
Carefully Make a knot
Now put weight on it
It will squeeze the excess of water out
The Paneer Cheese will be ready when we need it
A good pie is all about a good filling
For this one we ll use Fish and Spinach
What ?
Do you remember we are trying to gain subscribers ?
Well I do and thrust me
you wont find any watery spinach or bland fish in this recipe
Instead think of outstanding explosive flavors like mint ginger garlic lemon !
First things first
Lets marinate the fish
Cut 4 fillets of trout into big chunks
Season well with salt and pepper then place them in a bowl
Add a Drizzle of oil
A drizzle of honey
A crush of garlic
A gratted thumb of ginger
The juice of half a lemon
And all the zest you can get from it
A sprinkle of chopped mint leaves cant do any harm
Let it rest while we prepare the greens
From now on we will use an ovenproof frying pan
You can also use a skillet
Or a frying pan and a pie dish
Over medium high heat a big knob of Butter
Add a thumb of gratted ginger
2 crushed cloves of Garlic
Chop 3 onions
2 3 minutes should do it
Add loads of fresh spinach and let them fall down in the frying pan
Spinach will litteraly vanish in the pan
So When I say loads I mean tremendous amounts of spinach
Like  fuck i shouldnt put that much
A good big pinch of Salt pinch of pepper
When almost all the water has evaporated we can move on to the next step
Lets build the pie up
Two rolls of puff pastries on the board
Parchment paper under it
Heavy Sprinkling with an indian spices mix
Coriander seeds
Cumin seeds
Pepper corn
A bit of cinnamon
Fat is always a good carrier of taste because many flavors do not dissolve in water
In this case we use the fat of the puff pastries to retain the indian spices
Thoroughly rub to the puff pastries
On one roll sprinkle breadcrumbs
They will suck out the excess of moisture during baking
Spread the onions and the spinach
Carefully slide it in the same pan we used earlier
We are baking it in the frying pan for two reasons
One It is convinient
Second its unexpected
People are gonna get curious about it and even more when theyll discover whats inside
Next add the drained chunks of fish
Time to use the paneer cheese
Unwrap it slice it and place it on top
Fold the edges towards the center
Place the second roll on top spiced side down
Here comes a cool part
We are forming the pie not by sealing it but by folding it like a bed sheet
why ?
How many pies have you sealed in your life ?
And how many beds sheets have you folded ?
Gently Push the edges back in the pan under the first layer
Prick the pastry so that steam can escape
And finally brush the pie with milk
BOOM !
In a preheated oven until you achieve a nice golden brown finish
There we have it  The unexpected Palak Paneer Hinglish Pie !
Outside the shiny crust is crispy as hell and encrusted with bold indian flavors
Inside its all about freshness and moisture
Tell a story  Its no boring pie !
its journey made of warm blankets and dream countries
