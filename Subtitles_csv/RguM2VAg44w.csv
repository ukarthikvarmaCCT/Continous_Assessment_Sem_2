Hello friends!
The year 1945
on 5th December
at 10 past 2 in the afternoon
5 torpedo bomber aircraft of the US Navy
took off from Florida
This mission was called Flight 19
It was a 3hour long routine training mission
It wasnt anything special
they were simply flying to conduct their regular training missions
There were 14 crew members on the flight
led by their flight leader
a highly experienced pilot and war veteran
These five planes flew east from Florida
Everything was normal
the weather was clear
but about 2 hours after the takeoff
their squadron leader reported that
there were sudden problems in their compass
Their compass stopped working
They take out their backup compass
but the backup compass failed too
They cant determine their actual position
They ask the pilots of the other planes
but their instruments were malfunctioning too
Lt Charles Carol Taylor was the squadron leader
after the compass broke down
utterly confusing messages were sent over radio transmission
The weather starts worsening
At 456 in the evening
Taylor believes that their planes were flying over the Gulf of Mexico
And that they needed to fly east to get back to Florida
So he commanded the rest of the planes to fly east
But some of the crew abroad the flight believed
that they were already flying east of Florida
And that they needed to fly westwards
Right after this order
one of those planes sent a radio transmission saying
It shows that some of the crew members believed
that they had to fly westwards to get back home
But the weather continues to worsen
Its soon sunset and then the darkness of night
At this point it is believed that the planes were actually 370km east of Florida
At 704 PM
we get the last radio transmission from Taylor
After this all five planes are lost forever
Till date
we have no clue about these planes
Where are they? What happened to them?
After the disappearance of Flight 19
a SearchandRescue Mariner aircraft took off
with a crew of 13 people
They were on the mission to find Flight 19
But while looking for them they too disappear
First 14 people of Flight 19 disappeared
And then 13 people of the Mariner searchandrescue aircraft
For days after this
a large scale airandsea search operation was carried out
One of the largest search operations of the time
to look for both of these flights
But they could find nothing
Neither do they find a body of any person
nor any part of the aircraft
Everything had disappeared
the area where both planes disappeared
today we know that area as the Bermuda Triangle
We dont know which way is West
Over the past 50 years
3000 ships
and 100 planes
have gone missing in a mysterious stretch of water
in the Atlantic Ocean
Ships have gone missing
planes have gone missing
Known as the Devils Triangle
a source of intrigue
legend and fear
this is the Bermuda Triangle
The Bermuda Triangle is said to be
a very mysterious part of the ocean
There more than 100 aircraft and ships have disappeared
They were never found again
This area lies between Florida in the USA
Puerto Rico and the country Bermuda in the North
It makes a triangular area like this
Overall this area spans more than 500000 square miles
Tales of the Bermuda Triangle are older than 500 years
In 1492
when Christopher Columbus set out to find the New World
he reported that when he was passing by this area
his compass stopped working
And one night when he looked at the sky from his ship
he saw a weird light
A strange light that looked like a ball of fire
And he saw that ball of fire fall out of the sky into the ocean
This was the beginning of the mystery
over the next few eras several names were given to this area
The Graveyard of the Atlantic
The Sea of Doom
Sargasso Graveyard
These names were used in the 18th and 19th centuries
But the name the Bermuda Triangle
was used for the first time in 1964
In a magazine called Argosy
there was an article by Vincent H Gaddis in 1964
titled The Deadly Bermuda Triangle
This was the first time the phrase Bermuda Triangle was used
In this article
many disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle over the last several decades
were summarised by him
He had tried to link them all
Trying to create a mystery
Claiming that there is something peculiar in this area of the ocean
because of which so many aircraft and ships disappear
Although there were no explanations in the article as to why it happened
But this made the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle the most popular at the time
So popular that many books were written on it
Many films and computer games were made
there were songs on the Bermuda Triangle too
Talking about some other incidents
there was another horrifying incident in the year 1918
It involved the USS Cyclops
One of the biggest and fastest ships of the US Navy at the time
It was a very important asset for the American Navy
Especially when America began taking part in World War I
It was used to transport the troops and coal
On 4th March 1918
306 people were aboard the USS Cyclops
From a city near Washington called the West Indies Baltimore
this ship began its journey towards Brazil
Other than people this ship was carrying 11000 tonnes of manganese
The journey was supposed to take 9 days
Everything was fine with the departure of the ship
The weather was clear
While departing the ships send the message
But this message
was the last message from this ship
After this ship began its journey
there was no news from it
It had disappeared suddenly
This shocked everyone
One of the biggest ships of the US Navy
a ship this huge
how could it disappear suddenly?
If you think that this incident was mysterious
a more daunting and frightful incident
was the Ellen Austin mystery
In the year 1881
a 210 feet long ship
the Ellen Austin
Travelling from London to New York
quite common for the day
many ships undertook this journey at the time
But on its way Ellen Austin encountered an unidentified ship
Near the Bermuda Triangle area
From the outside this unidentified ship looked completely normal
but there was no trace of any humans aboard this ship
There was no crew no people at all
The captain of Ellen Austin decided to
go aboard the ship to see what had happened
First he brought his ship alongside this ship and waited for 2 days
so that they could see if there was anyone or even a trace of anyone
for any response from the other ship
But there was no response for 2 days
After that the captain set foot on the unidentified ship
There was a lot of stuff on this new ship
And everything was in the place it should have been
During that time people were wary of pirates
they used to be wary of an attack by the pirates
who would steal from the ships
This unidentified ship hadnt been subjected to this
Because all the valuable items of this ship were intact
Due to this reason the captain of Ellen Austin decided to
send some of his crew members on the ship
and that they would continue their journey with both ships
For the first 2 days both ships continued ahead normally
But then came a storm
Their paths separated
and the unidentified ship had disappeared
After the storm was over
the captain of the Ellen Austin tried to look for the ship
and he spotted the ship with this spyglass at some distance
When he reached near it
there was again no trace of any human aboard the ship
The crew members he had sent from his ship to the other ship
they had suddenly disappeared
Where did they go? What happened to them?
We dont know
But the ship was still intact
Its said that the captain of Ellen Austin tried once again to bring the ship with him
and sent some more crew members to steer the ship
but again after a few days there was another storm
and the same story repeated again
This unidentified ship gets separated
and the new crew members on it disappear once again
When Ellen Austin returned
the owner of the ship was so terrified after hearing this story
that he sold off the ship to a German company
They change the name of this ship to Meta
Yup thats right
the way that Mark Zuckerberg renamed Facebook into Meta
this ship too was renamed Meta
Isnt it an intriguing and legendary story?
But unfortunately friends
most probably this incident is just a story
Because this incident is so old
it is not possible to verify it properly
And the stories that are very popular historically
those that are passed down to generations
but that cannot be verified properly
the truth cannot be unearthed
we call those stories Legends
Urban Legends
Many rational thinkers believe
that the Bermuda Triangle is one such legend
What lies behind the incidents of the Bermuda Triangle?
There are many theories for it
Some people blame the aliens
that aliens had come and abducted the aircraft and ships
and had taken these with them
Some people believe that there is a giant sea monster under the ocean
that is behind the disappearances
Some people claim that this area of the ocean is peculiar
and the aircraft and vessels drown here
These theories are truly outlandish
So lets focus on the theories that
sound a bit more scientific
One of the explanations is based on magnetism
Friends the thing is that
the North Pole of the Earth
and the magnetic North Pole
are two distinct points
So when you look towards North on a compass
the compass is pointing towards the magnetic North Pole
But the real North Pole
is somewhere close by
It is known as the Geographic North Pole
You can see it in this photo
The difference between the Magnetic and Geographic North Poles
Normally when people use the compass
as has been done for ages
they take this into account
But there are some areas on the Earth
if you use a compass in these areas
you would find the Magnetic and Geographic North Poles at the same place
The places where this happens are known as
the Agonic Lines
These Agonic Lines shift with time
But for the last 200300 years
the 0 line has been around or in the area of the Bermuda Triangle
This can basically create confusion
The next strange thing about this area is that
the area in the Bermuda Triangle
is quite shallow
When you look at it on a satellite map
youd see that the Bahamas
Caribbean Islands
theyre surrounded by turquoise colour all around
This area in the ocean stretches across a long distance
with shallow waters
You can see the deep ocean around it
is represented in dark blue colour
and this area stands out when looked at through a satellite
Because of this it is said that
in the olden days when the ships came to this area
got stuck here due to shallow waters
Hidden shoals were the points where the land beneath the ocean was quite high
But it was not visible from the ships
When the ships were atop the area
they would get stuck there
The third peculiarity
this area has one of the highest rates of hurricanes in the world
If you rank the countries where most of the hurricanes are seen
China is at Number 1
then the USA at Number 2 followed by Cuba
Cuba lies in this area
And which state gets the most hurricanes in the USA?
It lies in this area
This area gets hurricanes and water sprouts more frequently
Methane Hydrates is the fourth explanation
There are some areas in the ocean
that have large fields of methane hydrates
In Australia scientists had conducted laboratory experiments
in which they had found that
when theres an exceeding amount of methane bubbles in the water
the density of the water gets lower
and the buoyancy of a ship cannot be maintained
and so the ship drowns
Its the same logic as when
the salt content of the water is high
the density of water increases
and it becomes easier for things to float
As is the case of the Dead Sea
If you recall I had made a vlog there
A normal person who would sink into the ocean
floats on the Dead Sea
because the density of the water is high
The same thing is happening here in reverse
If there is methane in the water
It is hypothesised
if there are methane eruptions in the water
they are also known as mud volcanoes
when volcanoes erupt underwater methane is released
and if it happens when a ship is over the area
then the ship would instantly sink into the water
without any warnings
Never to be heard from again
This is an interesting explanation
But in all the disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle
there was no direct evidence
that any exact incident was due to methane hydrates
This is simply a scientifically proven thing that exists
But to have actually caused the disappearance of any ship
has not been proven yet
The fifth explanation is the most important in my opinion
Because this is related to human psychology
This is known as the
BaaderMeinhof Effect
Or the Frequency Illusion
The BaaderMeinhof Effect or the Frequency Illusion is a psychological effect
It states that when we start to notice things more
then we start finding them more often around us
Remember when someone in your family bought a new car?
The model of the car you got
after buying it you would have noticed
that over the next few days or even months
whenever you were on the road
you started noticing the model of the car you bought more and more
You would notice the same model on the road
You may also feel like more people bought the model after you bought it
In reality the frequency of the car on the road didnt change much
It was just as common after you bought it as it was before
But because you bought the car
you started noticing it more
The same thing is said about the Bermuda Triangle
Though it is true that some big aircraft and vessels disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle
But if youve noticed
in many areas around the world across all oceans
there have been such disappearances of aircraft and ships
areas other than the Bermuda Triangle
One of the recent examples of this is the Malaysian Airlines flight
It hadnt disappeared around the Bermuda Triangle
The thing is that when people came across the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle
people started paying more attention to the disappearances and incidents there
The incidents taking place around the Bermuda Triangle
And the similar incidents that took place outside the Bermuda Triangle
people didnt pay much attention to them
Journalist Larry Kusche
the author of the book The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved
reached this solution too
He wrote that though there were some incidents that took place initially
but when with time when the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle gained prominence
some people started creating their stories
There was mysterymongering
and some stories were totally absurd
and hadnt really happened
The story of Ellen Austin that I told you
is said to be one such fabrication
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration of the US state that
theres no evidence that the aircraft and ships that disappear in the Bermuda Triangle
the mysterious disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle that we see
no evidence that they occur more frequently in the Bermuda Triangle
than compared to any other area of the ocean
It is not so
We see similar mysterious disappearances
in the other areas of the oceans as well
The United States Coast Guards have even said that
It shows that the Coast Guard of the USA dont even recognise
the Bermuda Triangle is a hazardous area
They said that the fact that the area within the Bermuda Triangle
is heavily trafficked
could account for some of the mystery
The area of the Bermuda Triangle
sees a lot of traffic of ships and aeroplanes
thats why the chances of such incidents happening here increase
Pair that with the fact that the
Bermuda Triangle is often swept by hurricanes
and the presence of the Gulf Stream
it is not hard to see why ships might
occasionally sink there
If you bear in mind that this area sees a lot of hurricanes
and the water is shallow here
you arrive at the straightforward answer to the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle
But despite the frequent hurricanes
when WWF had conducted their detailed study in 2013
for the Worlds 10 Most Dangerous Bodies of Water for Shipping
in the top 10 most dangerous waters
the Bermuda Triangle area was not on the list
Simply speaking
the mysterious disappearances have nothing to do with the Bermuda Triangle
You might ask now
what was the ball of fire that Christopher Columbus had seen fall into the ocean?
Theres a simple and scientific answer to it too
Scientists believe that it was actually a meteor
seen by Christopher Columbus
