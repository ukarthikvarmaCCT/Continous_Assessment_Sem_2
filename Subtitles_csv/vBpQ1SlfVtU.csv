This is the largest shredder in the world
and this Lamborghini is going to fall in it
Were also nuking an entire life size village
shooting real tanks at a literal Lamborghini
and crushing this store with the worlds largest domino
This is the first of many experiments
Youre going to love this video You ready?
Ready!  This is going to be crazy
All right Theyre falling
Come on
All right its working
Its actually working
Are we going to have to run?
You hear the thud?
Oh its going
All right that was the tallest domino in the world
That was the new tallest domino in the world
Down goes the domino!
Oh my God!
That was insane!
That was crazy!  We were way too close!
This isnt even the coolest thing were doing in this video
Were detonating the biggest explosion in YouTube history
launching a rollercoaster off its track and so much more!
Lets go to the next experiment
We got a lot of experiments today
And up next
were going to destroy an entire village
with a massive creeper explosion
And just for reference
a human sized version looks like this
Oh!  Oh okay
But were going to be detonating one 50 times bigger
Steve somehow you survived the last creeper
This one Im not quite sure youre going to survive
We dont believe Steves going to make it?
Oh heck no
Even though this is 50 times bigger it has 200 times the TNT
Bye Steve
Okay lets head in the bunker  All right Steve
Lets send Steve into the abyss
Just so you know how big this creeper is
Steve is actually taller than me
Hes getting close  Were in the Green Zone
This is going to be a massive explosion
Its getting closer any second now
I dont know when its going to happen
Oh Im scared
Oh my gosh
Oh my God  Im speechless for once
Im still processing that
That was insane  How are we allowed to do this?
We live in a country called America  Go America
If you thought that was cool I got news for you
Its about to get a whole lot cooler For our next experiment
I bought another Lamborghini
Adam this is your Lamborghini  Thank you
And youre probably wondering though whats the catch?
Yes Thats exactly what Im wondering
How do I put this?
Recently I may have obtained a military grade tank
In exactly three days
Im going to be raining missiles on your new car
And you get to use my credit card
to spend as much money as you want trying to defend it
If the Lamborghini survives you have a brandnew car
Im going to spend whatever it takes to defend this Lambo
Thats why I gave you my card
Okay fine Im going to do it
A lot of things racing in my mind right now
but its simplified into Stop Shell win Lambo
Adams first move was to call a construction crew
to bring in building materials and help him set up his first wall
Im going to want all the walls to kind of be a foot over my head
Thatll at least protect the direct shots on the Lambo
Now for the second part of my process its going to be the pool
There was a MythBusters episode
where they were shooting rounds into a pool
so that should stop the velocity heavily
Adams got a lot of work ahead of him to keep his Lambo from danger
And speaking of danger
we bought the worlds most dangerous roller coaster
And if youre wondering why its dangerous
Basically I put bombs on the ride
In theory if you were to ride this roller coaster
you should get launched off this rail
The only question is where would you land?
Lets see how far it goes when it gets launched off it
And obviously before we launch it were going to put mannequins on it
Everyone put your mannequin where you want
Hes got a good head on his shoulders
And the final touch
Push! As hard as you can!
All right get out of the way  Go! Go! Go!
All right there it is
This things going fast
All right Now its going to come down and go off the ramp
Here it goes
Go go go
All right Hold up hold up hold up
Oh that actually scared me
To be honest I thought it would go further
That was cool and all
Lets do that again
but with an explosive in the cart
Inside these boxes theres dozens of pounds of TNT
When were done pushing run to the bunker
You dont have to tell me to do that
Go go go go Were going
All right Im running
Go guys Go!
Go quicker  Go go go go go!
Oh my Gosh!
Get inside  Its going down!
That was awesome!
It might not have flown 100 feet but at least we blew it up
But that explosion is literally nothing
compared to what youre about to see
For the next experiment we have three safes
one that costs 1000 10000
and finally the 100000 safe
Its bigger than me
And were going to see how many explosives they can resist
These are actual explosives
Why is Chandler bringing them in?
Hes my dealer
Okay  Carefully set it down
I know this doesnt look like a lot but this is 1000
For however much we spent on each safe
we spent the same amount on TNT
And were going to see who wins this 1000 safe
or 1000 in explosives
Im going to put an egg inside the safe
Lets see if it turns into scrambled eggs
Usually during explosives we have a wireless switch
This time its hardwired
That actually scared me
Well the egg in the safe literally dont exist anymore
Lets try this again
with 10 times the explosives and a safe 50 times stronger
No joke
this thing has threeinchthick steel
Grab a crate of explosives
This is like explosive Jenga
Oh my gosh
Were like putting presents around a Christmas tree
The last egg did not survive
Lets see if a 10000 safe can protect it
Is this safe really worth ten grand
if it cant protect an egg from TNT?
I dont know if safes are meant to stop TNT
This button is hot  You want to hit it?
I do 3 2 1 go!
What? Oh my  Bro
The next one is supposed to be 10 times bigger
Than that one
which was ten times bigger than the previous one
Oh my God He put a divot in the ground
Yo can you guys believe Nolans mom fell right here?
Oh my God
It broke the glass on the hundred thousand safe
In hindsight I shouldve put the safes further apart
Ever since we were born weve always wondered
if you put 100000 worth of explosives around 100000 safe
would it protect an egg?
The ageold question
Youre in luck because Im about to answer it
So heavy!
This safe is now surrounded by 100000 in explosives?
You could say its unsafe now
Out of every explosion weve ever done
what youre about to see is the biggest by far
Our videos have gone so crazy that people think we fake them
This is a real explosion
Three two one
I dont even have any words
We woke up everybody in the city  Everybody in the entire state
Lets see if the egg survived Oh my gosh
Bro the back of the safe is gone
Bro it broke the foundation
Its all cracked in the floor
It seems like they put all their effort
in the 37000 pound door and not the walls of the safe
And the egg did not survive
If you ever want to rob a bank
just buy a hundred grand worth of TNT
in the meantime Adam had been going all night building his structure
Its like 200 am still so hot out here
And when I came back in the morning
I noticed he had some pretty interesting ideas for it
Adam! What am I looking at?
Scrapyard had a lot of cars
Im going to have at least two layers of cars
and Im probably going to stack them
The real secret is Im going to be using the engine block to stop it
That should give it more stopping power
than just the side of a vehicle
So far Adam has two cinder block walls
two layers of stacked cars and three pools full of water
all just to protect this Lamborghini from the tanks shot
What do you think the odds are that the Lambo survives?
That Lambos mine baby Were going to get it done
But I wasnt about to go easy on it
so we brought in extra support for tomorrow
Boys! Bring them in!
Oh my gosh
Now that we brought in two more tanks
the Lambo will be targeted from all sides
Adam doesnt stand a chance
You have a little less than 24 hours left
Good luck Adam
Youre going to need it
All jokes aside I am actually stressed out about that
If Id known there were going to be three tanks
I wouldve strategized completely different
While youre building were going to go test the tanks
Oh great
Kris Do you want to do the honors?
Yeah  Too bad
The test we built consists of a hundred pound safe
a trampoline and bulletproof glass But
Did it go through it?
Oh I can literally see through it from back here
This is the weakest of the three tanks
Adam is screwed
While Adam was wrapping up his protection
for his Lamborghini
were going to throw one into a shredder
And to show you how powerful it is
Im going to shred some other stuff first
Karl send it  Here we go! Yeah
Lets see what happens
Oh yeah!
That is so awesome!
That doesnt sound like piano noises
I think we need to wash down that piano
I agree Send the coke
Im 99 sure these are going to blow up
Oh there it goes!
And while were doing this
I want to tell you guys about Creator League
Its a gaming league brought to you by eFuse
and eight of the biggest gaming entertainers in the world

Ill do you guys a favor by getting rid of it
There it goes
There goes the Hersheys

Turns out not even this massive shredder
can digest Hersheys

while we clean out this shredder to get it ready for the Lamborghini
were going to go shoot another one with tanks
And things arent looking good for Adam
because he was running into a ton of problems
on his last night of filming
Were hitting some issues We need some things
Nothings open not being able to get enough resources
This is my last bricks
I cant believe we even got these done
three tanks is just impossible
I got to work through the rest of the night
I wouldnt forgive myself if I went to sleep now
Hi Jimmy
Please tell me youre not still building
Can I get five more hours?
Over the last 24 hours
Adam has managed to stash 20 more cars
build four more walls to the sides
and he also put two more giant pools
But you went out of your way to build this pool
but didnt fill it up
Yup I ran out of time to fill it up
You should learn time management
Yes I should
Noticing a lot less cars over here
Oh I see you put sand in here
Does it make it harder to push over?
Itll be fine
Bro do you just not want the Lambo?
Its going to work
This might be the last time we see this Lamborghini in one piece
Stay strong
Ill be back soon
And Ive obtained 20 real tank shells
Dont ask me how
And were not going to stop firing until we use all of them
The boys are loading the tanks
This is going to be awesome
Why is mine so small?  You know why
The moment of truth
Are you ready? Three two one
Oh One of my pools
We got a pool
No no no
Our first shot literally hit the pool in front of the Lambo
The water poured everywhere
How much water did you put in those pools?
Oh this is gross
Fire in the hole!
Oh my God
Im still holding out faith
Hey this one at the same time
All three  Oh my God
Three two one
Adams walls make it impossible to see the Lamborghini from here
So until we run out of ammo
we have no idea if his car made it or not
I felt that one  Yeah this is not good
Reload the tanks Kris
Your defense is not holding up there
This is not good
Im kind of grasping the straws at this point
Ive done all I can do
Fire in the hole
I have way too much power
I was so confident today too
I love how is just rapidfire tanks right now
My only hope is that theyre missing
Anyways what were you saying? Last shot
Adam this time you dont get a choice
You have to pull  If Imma go down
Imma go down looking like a G
All right
Oh hes running!
Adams car its done for
I cant see
I cant see
Lets go!
Come on!
Wait Are there no holes in it?
Man lets go baby!  You did it!
Whats crazy is even though the cars
arent strong enough to stop the rounds
they were able to deflect them
away from the Lamborghini
Theres a bullet in the pool  Oh my God
Theres a bullet in the pool
The pool right in front of the Lamborghini
caught a bullet for you
Thank you MythBusters
I owe you this but Imma keep the Lambo
Oh my gosh
Oh will he fit?
Hey he fits!
Hey were gonna make it work
Thats fine Were gonna make it work
Congratulations on the Lambo
Lets go shred another one
And now the moment you savages have been waiting for
This hunk of metal is going in the worlds largest shredder
Is it time?  Its time!
Lets drop it
Karl are you ready?
Ready!  Send the Lamborghini!
This suspense is killing me
Oh my God  Its hanging over the edge!
Oh my God!
There it goes
Lamborghini versus the worlds largest shredder
Its about to Oh!
Look at it It looks like its dancing
This is the coolest thing Ive ever seen
Bro our buildings shaking
Oh The cars fighting back
I think we need to push it down
Its stuck in the Lamborghini tires
so the cranes going to push it down
Shred the car Shred the car
Its doing it
Oh my God All right
And that is what a shredded Lamborghini looks like
Dont worry it didnt work It was decommissioned
