Hello friends!
Another conflict has broken out  between Israel and Palestine
At 630 AM on the morning of 7th October
While most of the Israelis were  sleeping soundly in their homes
suddenly the air raid sirens began blaring
In a short while thousands of  rockets were fired at Israeli cities
Israeli Defence Forces estimate that
2200 rockets were fired
However the group Hams claims that
5000 rockets were fired
Israel has an Iron Dome system
It is one of the best air defence systems in the world
Whenever rockets are fired on Israel
it uses the latest military technology
to intercept the rockets  and destroy them midflight
to keep the country protected
But here 5000 rockets were fired within 20 minutes
This Iron Dome system failed
Thousands of people were klled and injured  in Israel because of these attacks
This surprise attack is the biggest  in the last few decades
that has been seen in  the IsraelPalestine conflict
And it reminds us of the Yom Kippur War
Exactly 50 years ago
in October 1973
Egypt and Syria had launched  a similar surprise attack on Israel
After that a war broke out
Known as the Yom Kippur War
And this attack is no less  than a fullscale war
In addition to the rocket strikes
Hams launched a multipronged attack
from the ground sea and air
The boundary wall on the IsraelGaza border
was broken down by a bulldozer
Many Palestinians were seen  entering Israeli territory
Some on motorcycles
some using motorpowered hanggliders
to enter Israel through the air
Apart from this Hams also attacked Israel  from the sea using speedboats
Many events took place within a day
A military base on the IsraelGaza border  was also attacked
An Israeli tank was captured
Many Israeli soldiers were captured
and held hostages by the Hams group
And the Israeli villages and cities on the border
were infiltrated by armd trrrists of Hams
Many innocent civilians have been klld here
many are being held as hostages
and Israel has declared a state of war in response
The Israeli military carried out airstrikes in Gaza
In which thousands of Palestinians were klled or injured
Lets take a look at the map  to understand the context of this situation
Israel and Palestine are located in the Middle East
In the North is the country of Lebanon
In the Northeast there is Syria
In the East there is Jordan
In the South West there is Egypt
And in the West is the Mediterranean Sea
If you zoom in on both countries
the area in the middle is the country of Israel
And the territories of Palestine
are divided into two parts
One is the region of the West Bank
which is in the west of Jordan
and the other is the Gaza Strip
which is in the southwest of Israel
and borders Egypt
There are many Israeli settlements  in the Palestinian territory of the West Bank
They are under Israels control
And are considered illegal
by the United Nations and many other countries
The Palestinian territories in the West Bank
are administered by Palestinian Authorities
under the control of Fatah
A political party
On the other hand the Gaza Strip
is controlled independently by Hams
There has been a separate conflict  between Fatah and Hams historically
Hams is an extremist Palestinian organisation
which is considered a trrrist organisation  by most countries
Canada the European Union Israel
Japan Australia the USA and the UK
designate Hams as a trrrist organisation
On the other hand it is not considered a trrrist organisation by
Brazil China Egypt
Iran Norway Qatar
Russia Syria and Turkey
There are also some countries  that consider only Hams military wing
as a trrrist organisation
Like New Zealand and Paraguay
This is geopolitically relevant because
you will see how differently these countries  are reacting to the current situation
If we look at the map of the current conflict
we can see that
the Gaza Strip is shown in red colour
And the extent to which Israeli territory has  been infiltrated by the Palestinian militnts
is shown in blue colour
Hams military commander Mohammad AlDeif
has named this attack  Operation AlAqsa Flood
And said that Hams is doing this because
Israel has committed atrocities on the Palestinians
And that this is specifically a response
of what happened in Al Aqsa mosque
If you want to know about the issue regarding Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem
I talked about it in this video 2 years ago
I will put the link in the description below
you can go and watch it
For the Indian nationals present in Israel
the Indian embassy in Israel has issued an advisory
that you can see on the screen
In case of an emergency
they can call this number
or can send an email to this id
Israel launched its own attack in response
which was named Operation Iron Swords
Israeli Defense Forces  also known as IDF in short
have deployed their Navy Air Force and Ground Forces
Along with that they launched drone strikes in Gaza
Israels Energy Minister signed an order
to cut the electricity supply in Gaza
To a large extent electricity was  supplied through Israel to Gaza
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said at a television address
Citizens of Israel we are at war
He said that the enmy will have to  pay an unprecedented price
The defence minister stated that
Hams has made a huge mistake
and Israel will win this war
A big talking point in this conflict is how
Mossad the worldfamous Israeli intelligence agency
failed to intercept this attack
It is said that Mossad
is one of the most powerful intelligence agencies
They have informants even in  the Palestinian military groups
They are in Lebanon Syria
and in different parts of the world
In the past it has been seen that Mossad agents
have carried out precise timed asasinations
of major military leaders
Sometimes by placing GPS trackers on vehicles
sometimes by using drone strikes
or sometimes by using mobile phones
If you want to know more about Mossad
I would suggest this audiobook on Kuku FM

And now coming back to Mossad
the question is
despite being such a powerful agency
how did they not know that
thousands of rockets were being stockpiled in Gaza?
The fencing on the GazaIsrael border
has cameras ground motion sensors
and regular army patrols are carried out there
Why did these smart barriers fail?
Domestically the Israeli government  is facing a lot of criticism
The former head of the Israeli Navy
told the Israeli TV channel Channel 12 that
this is a huge failure on the part of the government
The entire country is asking
about the whereabouts of IDF police and security
He told the BBC that a major  investigation has already begun
regarding this intelligence failure
Look at this article from The Times of Israel
According to it Egypts intelligence officials
had warned Israel repeatedly that
something major was about to happen
And allegedly those warnings were ignored
On the other hand talking about international reactions
American President Joe Biden
condemned this attack and
said that he shows rocksolid and unwavering support
in favour of Israel
The foreign policy chief of the European Union
also said that he strongly condemns this attack
and says that according to international law
Israel has the right to defend itself
They said that Israeli hostages  should be released immediately
Iran which has been one  of the main supporters of Hams
their foreign ministry said that
the attack by Hams was an act of  selfdefence by the Palestinians
The foreign ministry of the neighbouring country Egypt said that
it is talking to Saudi Arabia and Jordan
in an attempt to diffuse the IsraeliPalestinian tensions
The Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas
told to the official news agency WAFA that
the Palestinians have the right to protect themselves  against the trrr of the settlers and foreign troops
As I said
he is from the Fatah party
which governs the West Bank
And historically there have been  conflicts between Fatah and Hams
2 years ago I made a detailed  video on the IsraelPalestine conflict
in which I explained their long history
In it I talked about how
Jews were persecuted in Europe for centuries
and to save their lives they migrated to Palestine
and now Palestinians have been reduced  to refugees in their own country
So Palestines cause obviously deserves support
but not by supporting trrrists
This has been the stance of  our Indian government historically
India has always supported the  Palestinian cause of selfdetermination
under various Prime Ministers
be it Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
Rajiv Gandhi Atal Bihari Vajpayee
Manmohan Singh or Prime Minister Modi
But the situation in the MiddleEast is clear
the land which is occupied by Israel
has to be vacated
Prime Minister Modi has actually  been the first Indian Prime Minister
to visit Palestine
Now the statement from PM Modi
has expressed shock
at the trrrist attacks
and he expressed solidarity with Israel
and Israels innocent victims and their families
And this is not surprising because
Hams actions here
is nothing but trrrism
Many disturbing videos have come up
where Hams trrrists have treated  women and civilians in a way that
cannot even be described in this video
It is a very shameful that
some people see them as freedom fighters
It is true that there has been injustice  against the common people in Palestine
but klling the common people in Israel
such trrrism can never be justified
Id like to repeat what I said in the previous video
Hams is a designated trrrist organisation
And Israel is a powerful country
with a proper democratic government
This is why Israel should use its powers responsibly
Some commnal bigts are very offended by such statements
On one hand there are people who want  complete eradcation of Palestine
They celebrate the attacks on Palestine
Saying that none of them should survve
Without thinking about the common Palestinians
and what they go through
On the other hand there are commnal  people celebrating Hams trrrists
They are happy to see Israel being attacked
They want Israel to be destryed
And that Israel should not exit as a country
When you come across such  comments on social media
remember that you are a human being
not a vampire thirsty for blood
Warmongering is very easy  when you are sitting far away
But think about it
if you were in the midst of this war
think about what the ordinary Israeli and  Palestinian families are going through
For life to come to a halt
And to live in fear
that a rocket might hit your building at any moment
Israel is also trying to show that
they are carrying out their counteroffensive responsibly
Recently there was an airstrike on  a 14storey building in Palestine
But before the airstrike Israel  had issued a 10minute warning
so that the people living in  the building should evacuate it
before the bmb could hit it
Such warnings have been given before
like the warning given to Fatima Bashirs family
before the Israeli airstrike in May this year
Or in August 2022 a 15minute  warning was given to Gazans
before an Israeli airstrike
Although Israel claims this
but the truth is that in Israeli airstrikes
many Palestinian civilians have been klled
We hope that
there can be longlasting peace  between these two countries
But looking at the current situation it seems that
this war is going to continue for a long time
I would suggest that you  understand the historical context
of the conflict between Israel and Palestine
What is the real reason behind it?
I have explained it in detail in this video

Thank you very much!
