If I gave you the choice to either buy 30 Lamborghinis or help save
the lives of 10000 people in one year which would you choose?
We decided to do this
Cue the epic highlight reel of the year
We started this mission in Khayelitsha South Africa
where we found an orphanage that was in desperate
need of our help because it was at risk of being closed down
I started back then I saved more than
5330 children
Those children would be dead
But we keep on opening the doors knowing that maybe someone
will come to our rescue
Like Beast Philanthropy
So we spent the next
six months working tirelessly by rebuilding 12 new homes
with an ongoing supply of fresh food as well as a brand new playground
While the orphanage was being built
we begin our next project
where we gave away 20000 pairs of shoes to kids in Africa
Beast Philanthropy what you have done here at my school
is absolutely amazing
Thank you Mr Beast!
Darren then flew to the Hopi Reservation
in Arizona where he met with Wendy
There are over 10000 members of the Hopi tribe
These people dont have very much but they are
some of the most generous people youll ever meet
The Hopi tribe is situated
hundreds of miles away from the closest quality clothing and food stores
which is bad because the winters here get freezing cold
and they need all the help they can get to stay warm and put food on the table
When we realized just how difficult it was for them to get access to these basic
neccessities we decided to donate over 27 million of clothing
It was amazing
Our kids our people are just so happy
Thank you MrBeast
We then found out that there is an abnormally high number of amputees
throughout Cambodia
so we partnered with Exceed Worldwide to give away 2000 prosthetic limbs
What weve experienced is that its so much more than a limb
Were giving back people their independence
But most important
I realized that we were giving them back their dignity and their selfesteem
Im so excited
and I really thank you!
Darren and Dan then flew to a remote island in Colombia
where they capsized a boat and fell in a river filled with
While they were there
they built a solar grid
which gave the island electricity and WiFi for the first time
which will give the kids on the island the ability to access education online
We also built a bakery to empower the woman in this community which
from day one was a hit
We then travelled to Kenya where fresh drinking water is extremely scarce
I am a father of six children and I want to be the best father of all
Thats why I work so hard to maintain my bread
My bicycle
it has no gears
One of the pedals is not there
the brakes are not 100 working
Sometimes I think if I could take a motorbike engine
and put it on my bicycle
my life would be easier
So with the help of Lectric E Bikes we were able to provide
Mr Barasa and 1000 other people with free electric bicycles
You have made work easier!
Its so easy to ride!
Darren and Dan then travelled to the Cure Childrens Hospital in the Philippines
where we were able to provide 160 kids with life changing surgeries
This little girl has just got her cast off and shes learning to walk
for the first time ever with her straight legs
The magnitude of the surgeries
that these kids are getting from Cure for free will change their lives
And the fact that Beast Philanthropy
can come in here and help Cure provide care to some of these kids
is something thats going to affect me and stay with me for the rest of my life
The construction of the orphanage in South Africa was now complete
and it was time to surprise Mama Rosie and the kids
Mama Rosie also told us about a boy named Yamkela who left the orphanage
14 years ago with the dreams of becoming a musician
However he was struggling to make money and practice his craft
working full time at the airport
It kills me knowing that Im doing something
that Im not into and there is something that
I want to do that I really love but I cannot do it
So we decided to surprise Yamkela with a brand new top of the range
acoustic guitar as well as award him a full scholarship to the best
music school in the country
See you in a year
The team then flew to Thailand
a country with over 2 million stray and disabled dogs
to meet with Michael and help him rescue as many dogs as possible
Where we help thousands of dogs run
for the very first time
As well as give Michael a brand new rescue van
state of the art gas machine and a brand new ambulance
Really happy
Thank you very much
Darren then received this video from a TikToker named Dora moono
Beast Philanthropy
please please help me save our village
our kids need you
So Darren immediately
flew to Doras sanctuary in Zambia which had absolutely no electricity
and is located in a dangerous area with high rates of domestic violence
It became evident that the lack of electricity
was holding them back and severely curtailing Doras ability
to help develop this village to what its potential could be
Having to wake up thinking what will these kids eat?
That is still very difficult to do each and every day
So we came up with a plan to use the direct sunlight
and scorching heat to our advantage by installing a massive solar grid
that will provide electricity to the entire village
It was then time to turn on the lights and the kids
couldnt contain their excitement
Mateo turn on the lights!
And we have lights!
We then found out about a college kid in Philadelphia that is rescuing
thousands of pounds of food every month because of his school meal swipes
I originally started just as a student with
leftover meal swipes in my dining account
and I realized as I was getting close to the end of the term
I have 50 meals left that I know Im not going to be able to use and
I just had a pit in my stomach thinking about all those meals going to waste
So Darren flew there to meet him and help expand his operation
to a national scale
After witnessing everything that Evan had done to help this community
it didnt take but
an hour to know that we had committed to partnering with Sharing Excess
to help them achieve their goal of feeding as many people as possible
And with our help Sharing Excess were able to open an operation at
Hunts Point Produce Market the largest
produce market in the world in New York City
And that operation
is going to be three times larger than the one that we have in Philly
Next Darren and Dan travelled to the heart of Cameroon
where thousands of children at this school have to share a single toilet
and have lessons in these derelict and dilapidated classrooms
These conditions had no dignity
These conditions would not make a child believe that the future is bright
Once we saw this we knew we had to do something
So almost immediately we started drawing up plans to begin
construction and a few months later the brand new classrooms were built
Just in time to surprise the kids before they return from their holidays
Lastly we flew to Nepal
for a secret project that will be revealed next year
But on that mission Dan and Darren went to 21000 feet high to Mount Everest
to sign out this video where the altitude made Dan very loopy
Darren and I
are at the highest point weve ever been together
Its been one hell of a year
You know weve been working together just one year and look where we are
on top of the world literally and figuratively
And I wouldnt share this experience with anybody else man
Send this to any billionaires you know and tell them to stop buying
cars and instead help people
ITS BEEN SUCH AN INCREDIBLE YEAR
AND WEVE HELPED SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD
BUT NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT YOU
YOU ARE THE HEART AND SOUL OF BEAST PHILANTHROPY
AND WE ARE BEYOND GRATEFUL FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT
HUGE LOVE BEAST PHILANTHROPY
