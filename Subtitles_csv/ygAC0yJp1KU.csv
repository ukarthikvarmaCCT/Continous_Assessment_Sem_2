Hello friends!
This is one of the most searched questions on the internet
How to lose weight?
And this is probably the most popular  New Years resolution in the world
Weight loss
On this one question  millions of YouTube videos have been made
thousands of articles have been written
and so many rumours have been spread
Some tell you to eat Maggi for a muscular body
some tell you to go on a lowcarb diet
some tell you to go on a lowfat diet
some try to sell their fake products
A entire industry has been built on  weight loss
In todays video lets understand this concept in a scientific way
Whats true and whats myth?
To lose weight what should you eat and  what should you not eat?
And which diet is the best?
Lets find out
The Wonder 10day diet!
Burn away fat while you sleep!
A diet that can work when nothing else will
The popular Paleo diet
Ketogenic or Keto
Brand new South East diet
Promising new weight loss drug
Another groundbreaking weight loss drug
could soon be available in pill form
The logic behind weight loss is quite simple
Imagine that you have a bank account
All the money you earn gets accumulated in your bank account
All the money you spend  is deducted from your bank account
So if you want to increase your bank balance
you either have to increase your earnings
or reduce your expenses
Similarly our body has a calorie bank
The calories you consume accumulate here
And the more you spend  it is deducted from the stored calories
This calorie bank is our body
To store calories they are converted into fat and stored by the body
which increases our weight
So if you want to lose weight
either reduce your calorie intake or
spend more calories
To spend calories is known as Burning Calories
Lets talk about how calories burn later
before that lets know
where do calories come from?
The food you eat
whatever you drink except water
all of them have energy
in the form of calories
In nutritional science the definition of calories is that it is a unit of energy
So the food and water you are consuming that is where the calories are coming from
Since calories are a form of energy
everything for which the body uses energy
calories are burned for those
The most obvious thing that comes to peoples mind to burn calories is exercising
This is true
our body needs energy is needed for every process
so calories are burned for everything
To make your heart beat
for your lungs to breathe
to digest food in your stomach
energy is needed for all
For this reason even while sleeping at night your calories are burned
You heard it right
On average a normal person burns 400 calories during 8 hours of sleep
And these calories are burned merely to keep the body alive
this is known as  Basal Metabolic Rate or BMR
Every person has a different  Basal Metabolic Rate
It depends on your height weight muscle mass and many other factors
There is an online calculator through which you can calculate your BMR
The link is in the description below
For example I am 28 years old
and my height is 186 cm
and weight is 80 kg
So my BMR is 1828 calories per day
So I will burn this many calories every day without doing anything
Now apart from this I told you that eating
provides calories to the body
But do you know depending on what food you are eating your food can burn calories too?
Here comes the concept of the  Thermic Effect of Food in short TEF
The logic is very simple
when you eat food your body has to digest the food
absorb nutrients from the food
and store the food
In all these processes the body uses  energy and burns calories
So some things have a low thermal effect
Like fats oil flour and butter
Our body digests these things very easily
There is almost no need to burn any calories
On the other hand whole grains or protein rich foods
Dairy eggs highfibre vegetables and fruits
spinach broccoli  these have a high Thermic Effect
Our body has to burn a lot of calories to digest these foods
That is why it becomes difficult to gain weight by eating this type of food
Now you will wonder if this means that
some types of food may provide negative calories
The calories available in that food the body is burning more calories to consume that food
This is a myth friends
To achieve this the thermic effect of any food should be more than 100
which is impossible
This cant happen
The highest thermic effect possible is around 30
usually found in proteins
This means that if you are eating 100 calories of protein
you are spending 30 calories to digest that protein
and your body is actually gaining only 70 calories
Now there is no need to go into the math too much
I am not asking you to find out the thermic effect of every food before eating
I just wanted to give you a basic idea
so that you know that this kind of concept exists
Now lets talk about weight loss
After listening to what I said till now
people might wonder why should we exercise at all
If you consume fewer calories than your  bodys basal metabolic rate
you will lose weight automatically
Theoretically this is true but practically it is very dangerous
Eating fewer calories than your BMR  without exercising means that
your bodys hormonal balance can deteriorate
You will be more tired
You will become more irritable
It will be very difficult for you to focus on your studies and work
Do you know which body part consumes the most calories in the human body?
Our brain
Almost 20 of the energy usage of the  human body is consumed by the brain
It becomes difficult to selfcontrol for the body
Many people have this problem
where once they start eating less
they become weak
their mood is disrupted terribly
they will go on a diet for some time
but after that they will start binging
and their diet will fail
Thats why our goal should not be weight loss
but healthy weight loss
And for healthy weight loss exercise is very important
In fact four main things are very important
Diet control exercise proper sleep and keeping yourself stressfree
The last two points are quite obvious
but if you struggle with them
keeping yourself stressfree
and getting 8 hours of sleep daily
then it means that you are not managing your time properly
And in such a situation you need the right time management in your life
I made this course on time management and productivity to teach you this
The special thing is that I focus a lot on happiness in this course
Waking up at 5 am every day  and working for 12 hours a day
I am strongly against this type of hustle culture advice
Thats why my time management course will
not only increase your productivity but also your overall life satisfaction
I use the stepbystep techniques that  I teach you in this course in my life
with the help of which
I can regularly bring you these videos while travelling the world
Those who have taken the course so far have found it very lifechanging
You can see their reviews on the screen

While joining just remember one thing the the entire course is in the English language
Now lets come back to the topic
and understand diet control in detail
Have you ever had a feeling that even  though you have eaten a whole chocolate bar
but still you are feeling hungry?
After eating certain things you still dont feel full
The reason behind this is the Satiety Index
The thing is that there are some types of food
after eating which you feel full
and some types of food arent like that
In 1995 some researchers
tested 240calorie servings of 38 types of food
They found that boiled potatoes had the highest satiety index among all potato dishes
Potatoes were given a score of 323
There are some other things like pulses
highfibre foods lowfat dairy products eggs and nuts
These things also have a very high index
This means that for the same amount of calories
if you eat highsatiety food items
you will comparatively feel more full
You will feel less hungry even though the number of calories is the same
Now some people will say that
they would eat boiled potatoes throughout  the day for breakfast lunch and dinner
So they consume the least amount of calories in the day
while feeling full
Theyll go on a potatoonly diet
But again this is a wrong approach
It is alright to tweak a few things here and there
but overall the body needs a nutritious diet
Your goal here is healthy weight loss
Meaning you dont want to lose muscle
you dont want to lose your health
you just want to lose weight
There are 6 different essential nutrients
that the body needs for optimal function
Proteins carbohydrates fats  vitamins minerals and water
So when you are on a healthy weight loss diet
you will definitely need proteins vitamins minerals and water
Now the question is about  fats and carbohydrates
What about them?
Many people suggest different types  of lowfat lowcarb diets
So lets talk about carbohydrates first
Carbohydrates in short carbs what is their relation with weight loss?
The sugar that comes out of carbs is an important source of energy for the body
If our body does not use that energy immediately
the energy from the carbs is converted  into glycogen and stored
in the liver and muscles
If a person eats more carbs than his body needs
the body converts those carbs into fat cells and stores it as fat
If this energy is not used later it remains in the form of fat cells
and you gain weight
You might think that carbohydrates should be avoided
but this is the wrong conclusion
I apologize in advance for disappointing  the fans of keto or lowcarb diet
In 2017 a metaanalysis was done  of 32 controlled feeding studies
Keeping the level of protein and calories the same
they found out whether highcarb diet is better or a lowcarb diet
This research found that there is no benefit in weight loss
whether you follow a highcarb or a lowcarb diet
Weight loss ultimately works only due to Calorie Deficit
The same calorie bank balance that  I explained in the beginning
In 2012 another study was conducted in a Swedish University
to compare whether a lowfat diet is better or a lowcarb diet
This study monitored people for 2 years and ended with the same conclusion
Weight loss has nothing to do with these things
Only calories are important here
Now some people go on a highprotein diet to lose weight
Because some people have a perception that
if they eat fats or carbs they will convert into fat cells leading to weight gain
But if they eat protein only their muscles will grow bigger
It is true that protein is usually used for muscle building and muscle repairing
So if you do weight training  exercise more wrestle or such
then naturally you will need more protein
But if you sit on the sofa all day  dont move dont exercise
then the excess protein you are eating also converts into fat
Now some people will say  after watching this video that
they went on a lowcarb diet and lost weight
thinking that it works for them
But here I would like to say that
if your body is suddenly deprived of carbs
then your body loses water weight
Glycogen stores help in retaining water in our body
So if you go on a keto diet for a week you will lose 12 kgs of weight for sure
And that will be because your body has lost its water weight
As soon as you start eating carbs again that water weight will come back
Dr Sara Seidelmann and her team of researchers
did a study on 15400 people for 6 years
It was published in the famous Lancet Public Health Journal
And it studied people who are on a lowcarb diet
but are eating more animal protein
This study found that this diet can actually reduce the lifespan
When a lowcarb diet is replaced by plant protein and fat
then it will be beneficial
I have talked about this in the video of Worlds Oldest Human
what are the things that can be done to extend our lifespan
Now if we have to go lowcarb  then how low should we go?
This study found that if less than 40 of total energy is coming from carbs
or more than 70 of total energy comes from carbs
Both pose a higher risk to our health
It means that what we were taught in school
is very important here
A balanced diet
While doing a healthy weight loss you dont need to completely remove carbs from your diet
Rather you need to eat healthy carbs
Carbohydrates is the food for the brain
If you stop eating carbs your brain health may start declining
Aggression depression nervousness anxiety trepidation all these are part of it
What are healthy carbs?
Carbs that are absorbed by the body slowly
These dont raise or lower the blood sugar level
And give the body a steady source of energy
Examples of these are whole grains fruits and starchy vegetables
And now lets talk about fats
When you hear the word fat you might think that they make you fat
But this fat nutrient is also an essential nutrient
and the body needs it too
Many vitamins like vitamin A vitamin D vitamin E vitamin K are fatsoluble vitamins
so the body needs fats to absorb them
Apart from this fats are needed for hormonal balance
energy storage and to protect our vital organs
Human brains are made up of 60 fat
And this advice was given by the popular nutritionist Pooja Makhija
This trend of eating a lowfat diet  she was against it
She said that fats dont make you fat
Rather eating more fat and eating the wrong kind of fat makes you fat
So a healthy weight loss diet is a balanced diet
in which carbohydrates proteins and fats are present
The next question is what is the  optimum percentage of each of them?
What is the healthy proportion?
There is a range called Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges AMDR
According to this 4565 of your daily calories
should be from carbohydrates
2035 of calories should be from fats
1035 of calories should be from protein
The percentage you should be in this range
depends on your personal lifestyle choices
Your age
how much muscle you want to gain
are you diabetic what kind of food you prefer
For these you can consult a professional dietician
and it will be a good idea  to get a diet plan customized for you
If you do not want to consult a dietitian
then for an average person who is  not facing any health problems
it would be better to stay within this range
So the next question you will ask is how can you stay within this range?
What to eat and what not to eat?
Lets clear this point by point
What should you eat?
You should eat whole grains
Complex Carbohydrates
Other than wheat and rice
you should eat different types of grains like
corn oats barley ragi buckwheat kuttu
amaranth which is also called chaulai
or pearl millet bajra
Eat them as flatbreads roti or porridge
Apart from this you should eat legumes like grams chana
or different types of lentils
These are good sources of complex carbohydrates
And they also have fiber and protein
Then you focus on other healthy foods like fruits and vegetables
Kidney beans rajma chickpeas chole  soy protein soya chunks
gram powdered sattu fruits berries
dry fruits peanuts walnuts
pumpkin seeds chia seeds
flax seeds spices eggs
Dairy items like milk curd and cottage cheese paneer
contain healthy fats
They should be eaten in controlled amounts
It is important to mention that many people think that they are eating a balanced diet
But in reality their diet is not balanced
In North India you must have seen many people
eating 34 rotis with half a bowl of vegetables
This is not the right proportion
Unknowingly in their homecooked meals many people
eat more rotis in a higher proportion of carbs
They should increase the amount of vegetables
Other than water what else should one eat?
Drink water eat green vegetables
green is very good for the body
It contains antioxidants  it is good for the skin
I eat a lot of vegetables
Dont be stingy in buying vegetables
And second dont bargain with the vegetable vendor
Even if you save 510 by paying less to a poor person
you wont be able to build a palace
If you want to save money
dont spend 150 on burgers
dont spend 400 on pizza
The online food delivery apps that you use
on which you spend thousands every month
save money there
I would say stop relying on food delivery apps
Use that money to buy nuts seeds fruits and other healthy food
If you dont want to cook food hire someone
Someone will get employment and you will be able to eat healthy and tasty food
Now lets talk about what you should not eat in a healthy weight loss diet
First of all refined flour
Refined carbohydrates like refined flour get digested very quickly in your body
You can see unhealthy spikes in your blood sugar levels because of this
And if you eat many things made of refined flour
then after 12 hours of eating  you will start feeling hungry again
Because shortly after eating these  your blood sugar levels drop rapidly
The second problem with refined flour is that
it has bad cholesterol  known as LDL cholesterol
which causes arteries to clog increase in blood pressure
increases hunger increases craving for sweets
Second stop eating sugar
This is the same problem with refined sugar
which is also called added sugar
I explained this in the video on cold drinks
This added sugar is not only found in cold drinks but also in ice creams candies biscuits etc
Third stop eating bad fats
As I told you earlier
there are two types of fats
Good fats and bad fats
Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats  are beneficial for us
We get these good fats from plant sources
Like peanuts olive oil pumpkin seeds sesame seeds
almonds pistachios walnuts sunflower oil flaxseed oil
On the other hand we need very little saturated fats
But most people eat a lot of saturated fats
They are found in butter raw coconut oil or clarified butter desi ghee
If you eat a lot of saturated fats for many years it increases the risk of heart attack
Palm oil also has saturated fats which is found in most packaged foods in India
And then comes trans fats  which are the most harmful
These trans fats are found in refined oil which is usually in everything that you eat out
Fried food fried chicken  fried momos fried doughnuts french fries
Indian street food golgappas samosas  all of these have high value of trans fats
because they are deep fried
Deepfried foods should be avoided
Some people watch this and say  that I am fearmongering
Theres a channel called Foodpharmer
they make good healthrelated videos
But people accuse him of fearmongering since he points out things that one shouldnt eat
Fearmongering means spreading fear about something unnecessary
But the thing here is that these things  are they are actually very dangerous
Avoid eating as much packaged food as possible
These are ultraprocessed food items made in factories
They are made of everything thats harmful to us
Refined flour added sugar  artificial sweeteners palm oil
artificial food colours harmful preservatives
First lets look at the things made of refined flour
Biscuits Rusk Mathri Chakli
Namakpare Fanpuffs Samosa Kachodi
Pav Bhaji Vada Pav Aloo Patty
Hot Dog Bhature Kulcha
Tandoori Roti Naan Malabar Paratha
Pizza Donuts Chowmein
Spring Rolls Momos Jalebi
Ghevar Gulab Jamun Pancakes
Muffins Cakes Sandwiches Phew!
In fact even your favourite Tandoori Masala Chhaap has 40 refined flour
And what are the other harmful things  in these food items?
Bad oil the deepfried things
like Bhature Samosas Kachori Momos
the examples I just listed out
Added sugar apart from this cold drinks ice cream candies chocolates biscuits
cereals packaged juice and even the expensive biscuits
which are sold as highfiber multigrain digestive
contain refined flour sugar palm oil
raising agents artificial flavouring substances
Most people consume these on a daily basis
I would like to give you a 30day challenge
stop eating these which contain these 4 things
Maida added sugar bad oil or trans fats and packaged food
Dont eat these things for 30 days
and youll see a transformation in yourself
After these 30 days youll feel
much more healthy
Youll have more energy
Youll be able to concentrate more on work and studies
You might be thinking  that I havent left out any ingredients
What can one eat if not these things?
Dont be disheartened
Because therere so many things to eat other than these
You can eat rotisabzi with very little ghee or butter
Idli Upma Poha Dhokla
Omelette Moong Dal Cheela Dosa
Uttapam which is made with very little butter
Milk Curd Lassi
Boiled Eggs Natural Fruit Juice Cheekushake
Anjeershake Misi Roti Tawa Paratha
Raita Butter Milk Jeera Rice Biryani
Hara Bhara Kebab Mushroom Tikka Paneer Tikka
You can eat these if they are made in desi ghee butter or olive oil
The interesting thing is that when you  start eating more of these things
and less of the unhealthy things
you will notice a transformation
your taste buds will start changing
You will stop craving for that unhealthy food
This happens a lot to me
I never feel like eating packaged food
You will crave fresh fruits and fresh vegetables
If you are not used to eating all this fresh food
you can start with your favourite fruit or vegetables
Also learn to control your portions while eating
Always drink a glass of water before eating
so that you dont need to eat much
Eat on small plates with small spoons
and eat slowly
Dont eat so much that your stomach is 100 full
Eat till it is 80 full
I had talked about this in the  video on the Worlds Oldest Human
How in Japan people have a philosophy of
eating only till they are 80 full
When you eat more vegetables
which have more fibre and more volume
youll feel less hungry  youll have less space in your stomach
and youll consume fewer calories
Now this was all about food
Apart from this the most important thing is exercise
There are three different types of exercises
First stamina or cardio exercises
which are important for your cardiovascular fitness
Like swimming running or playing any other sport
The exercises that increase your heart rate
Second stretching exercises
they are very important for your flexibility
These include exercises like Surya Namaskar and Yoga
And third strength training
which is important for your muscle strength and muscle endurance
These include lifting heavy weights
going to the gym doing pushups  squats planks or lifting dumbbells
So ideally all these 3 types of exercises  should be balanced in a healthy lifestyle
But for weight loss it doesnt matter  what type of exercises you do
as long as these exercises are helping to burn calories
Some exercises obviously burn more calories than others
Like running rope skipping playing  badminton football and squash
Some exercises burn fewer calories
like playing cricket doing yoga or stretching
So broadly speaking you have to keep in mind that
you should burn more calories  if you want to lose more weight
But you should do the exercises in the form you like
Whether you do Zumba for 30 minutes
or run for 30 minutes its up to you
Apart from this movement should be  included in your daytoday life
like walking or cycling as much as possible
The extra calories that are burned by these activities
adds up throughout the day
Always remember doing something  is much better than doing nothing
Some people search for  best exercises to lose belly fat
Or the best exercises to lose facial fat
Friends these are only myths
To some extent particular muscles can be toned
but spot reduction is more or less not possible
Most of the research and studies that have been done
do not support this
The areas where our body stores fat
and the areas where the fat is burned by burning calories
depends entirely on the body
Your job is to exercise
your body will decide for itself  from where the fat should be burned
When you do this consistently
then overall one day your body  will get into a good shape
This depends on genetics
the areas where your body will lose fat
I would like to mention a final point here  stress
There is a significant link between weight gain and stress
When you feel stressed
your bodys cortisol levels increase
This reduces your metabolism
and increases your craving for fat and sugar
So if you want to lose weight
it is important to manage stress as well
For this you can do meditation play sports
or spend time with friends and family in real life
I have told you a lot of things in this video
but I have summarized all the useful  information on weight loss for you
Lets do a small rewind
so that you remember everything
The simple principle behind weight loss  is Calorie Deficit
Control the calories you are eating
and increase the calories you are burning
The calories you are eating should come  from your nutritious balanced diet
Eat more whole grains fibrous fruits  vegetables and proteins
so that your stomach feels fuller
So that you feel less hungry
Avoid eating refined flour white sugar  bad oils and packaged food
so that your food cravings can be reduced
and you can focus on healthy nutrients
Move your body daily in some way or the other
and include exercises in your regular routine
Cardio exercises strength training and stretching exercises
Make sure to sleep for 79 hours daily
and keep stress away from your life
And also remember that spot reduction doesnt work
and being healthy
doesnt mean you have to fit some beauty standard
These things make a perfect plan  for healthy weight loss
If you want to follow this plan
