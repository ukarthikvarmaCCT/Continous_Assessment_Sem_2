Hello friends!
All of us have an aim in life
If youre a college student
you have assignments you need to complete
If your exams are approaching
you will promise yourself that youll do your best to prepare for the exams
so that you can top the exam
If you are looking for a job
you want to prepare for the job
Why dont you do it?
Were waiting for you to do it
It takes no time for us to decide
what we want to achieve
but then we dont really do what we ought to
Theres an inherent feeling that tells you
that you can do it tomorrow
and that its okay if you relax for a while on Instagram
scroll through the web or watch comedy videos on YouTube
While we put off things for tomorrow we end up wasting time today
And tomorrow never arrives
Theres an English word for it
Why do humans procrastinate?
In todays video lets try to understand it from a scientific perspective
the psychology behind procrastination
and find the real solution to it
Today well talk about laziness
Ive always been lazy my parents are trying to change me but theyre also lazy
Such people have to strong desire to rest
Nothing will happen in the end
You will fail in your comfort zone
Tomorrow Ill be doing what I was supposed to do 2 days ago
What goes on in the heads of procrastinators why we are the way we are?
Rich people dont sleep 8 hours a day
They leave everything up to God they simply eat and sleep
Friends in this video I wont be giving you a motivational lecture
because I believe that motivation is a shortlived phenomenon
If you feel motivated after watching a video
and start working powered with that motivation
you will work well for the next few hours
at most you will be motivated for the next 23 days
but then the motivation would come crashing down
and you stop working
Here wed use science to go to the root cause of procrastination
Dr Piers Steel is one of the leading researchers in the world
on the science of motivation and procrastination
He has been studying this science for over 10 years
He believes that procrastination isnt a problem which
is seen exclusively in this era
It has existed for ages
Thousands of years ago in 1400 BC
Egyptian hieroglyphs have been found
that talk about it
A University of Toronto Egyptologist translated this
Friend stop putting off work
and allow us to go home in good time
About 600 years after this in 800 BC
an ancient Greek poet had said something similar
In India centuries ago Sant Kabir had famously said
youd recall this
Work today instead of putting it off for tomorrow
Work now instead of putting it off for later
If a catastrophe strikes now
when will you prepare for it
He clearly tells you not to put off work for tomorrow
not even for later in the day
or else if everything will end in a moment
you wont be able to finish what you had set out to do
This has been reiterated by many poets and motivational speakers in history
But we have gotten worse
According to Dr Steel
in the last 40 years
there has been a 300 to 400 growth in chronic procrastination
Today half the population in the world
They procrastinate frequently
But why do we do so?
We need to dig deeper
Think about the things you procrastinate doing
When you have to prepare for an exam
or for a job interview
you procrastinate
But have you ever procrastinated while scrolling on Instagram?
Or while watching a comedy video on YouTube?
We procrastinate if it is an office project
Or for exercising
Or if it is something emotional well procrastinate
When I need to say something important
when I have to keep a promise
when I have to reach out to someone
when I have to reconnect with someone
I am always late
Basically we procrastinate when it is something important
Something that requires a lot of effort
Physical mental or emotional effort
We replace that task with something
that is easier and more interesting for us
Such as browsing on social media
Or watching a film
Here deadlines play an important role
If there is a deadline for our task
wherein we need to finish it before the deadline
we procrastinate until we reach the deadline
Suppose we have to make a presentation and submit it tomorrow
even this morning youll feel like procrastinating and scrolling through Instagram
Only for 5 minutes before you begin the project
And were very familiar with how
the 5 minutes turn into 1 hour without us finding out
I have talked about this in detail in the video on Social Media
These websites have been designed in a way that
even if you spend a little time on them
it sucks you in
and this little time turns into a long time
But even if you start working 1 hour later
youll be hungry and start raiding your fridge
so that you can get the energy to study
But after eating you would want to set the mood to be productive
To do so you will start watching comedy videos on YouTube
Another hour wasted in it
and you start feeling tired
so you think that its better to take a shower get freshen up before starting work
Hours pass by and day turns into night
and then an alarm goes off in your mind
you are left with 12 hours only you need to finish it somehow
When it is time to sleep
you start making the presentation
you stay awake the whole night and work on it till the last minute
Several studies have been conducted on college students
Such as the study by Ellis and Knaus in 1977
or by OBrien in 2002
According to these approximately 80 to 90 of college students
But in college at least were given a deadline
so that somehow or the other we complete our work by the end moment
but what happens when there are no deadlines?
Friends in such cases the procrastination may continue infinitely
There is no end to procrastination
Wasting time in college meant that
you dont get good marks
or you may not get a good job
these arent crucial
But procrastinating later in life would mean
that your life may be full of regrets
If you had a dream of trying your hand at filmmaking
to quit your job and become a filmmaker
but you never actually try to make it happen
You would have heard elders say something like
they wanted to become great at something when they were younger
and that they couldnt do it because of circumstances
They say that they used to have big dreams
Often they blame the circumstances
But they know that they didnt try
They are now stuck with a permanent What If feeling
To procrastinate on fitness and exercising means
you will eventually gain weight
nothing major
if you start eating healthy and start exercising
within a few months or years you can lose weight once again
But if you continue procrastinating for years
one day it will come as a shock
that you have diabetes
or youd be told that you need to put in a stunt in your heart
Some people dont even get this chance
They get sudden heart strokes and lose their lives
Apart from this the consequences of procrastinating on emotional stuff are severe
You might dream of taking your grandparents
on an aeroplane one day
but that day may not come
If you keep procrastinating about this
one day you will find out that they passed away
As a result youll be left with heavy regret
Disappointment over these
It is not only about lifetime regret
it brings in stress anxiety and depression as well
The thing you want to do and the thing you are doing
if theres a huge gap between the two
there will be a mental conflict within you
this can be termed Cognitive Dissonance
In a study conducted in a German university on more than 1000 people
it was found that due to procrastination
there are high levels of stress depression anxiety fatigue
it impacts everything
Another feeling that accompanies procrastination is guilt
If we arent happy with procrastination
why do we do it?
Scientists have come up with 4 theories for it
The first is the Expectancy Theory
Given by Victor Harold Vroom in 1964
according to this theory the motivation of a person to do a task
depends upon the expectation of the person with the result
The chances of achieving the result of the task are low
the motivation to do the task will also be low
For example
suppose your school or college tells you
that the person wholl get the first rank in the class
will get a reward of 1 million
will you get motivated to study hard?
Will you work to get the 1st rank?
If you are someone that scores high in your class
and you know that you are always in the top 10
you know that you have a high chance to win this prize money
If so you will study as diligently as you can
and will start working immediately to get the 1st rank
But if you are someone
that lags behind in class
you dont get good marks
and rank in the bottom
and you know there are more diligent and intelligent students in class
then you know that you have a low chance of winning the prize money
And so your motivation to study will be low as well
There is a direct relation
of the level of your motivation to the expectancy of the result
Remember this
Now lets talk about the second theory
The second theory is the need theory
Coined in the 1960s by famous psychologist David McClelland
He says that there are 3 types of needs of people
Affiliations mean the need for social relationships
Depending upon your personality
your most vital need depends on you
If you are given a task that matches your psychological needs
you will be more motivated to do it
Lets take another example
What do you think our politicians need the most?
Every one of them wants to rule
this shows their strong desire for power
If they are given a task related to that need
they will rush to complete the task
Their motivation will be through the roof
But on the other hand if they are tasked
with working for the people
since they do not have a strong need for that
they will procrastinate on that task
Similarly you have to figure out your dominant need
Your psychological needs
If you have a strong need for power
you will want to succeed at your job
in such cases if you are given a task to get a job promotion
you will have the highest level of motivation to do that task
Understand your needs and look at your tasks from that perspective
Another example is if you have a strong need for affiliation
it means that you respect building connections with people
for maintaining relationships with people
their respect and their approval are of higher priority
then youll excel at the tasks related to team work
The third theory is the Cumulative Prospect Theory
This was coined in 1992 by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman
This theory talks of mainly 2 things
First is loss aversion
It means that if at the same magnitude you will face a profit or a loss
it would be significant for you
and you derive motivation from it
Loss of a particular magnitude
weighs more heavily than
a gain of the same magnitude
The example of exercising that I cited a while back
If I tell you to exercise
so that you are fit and build muscles
the motivation you get from this will only be a little
But if I tell you to exercise
because your test results reveal that you will soon become diabetic
and if the doctor says that if you dont exercise
you might suffer a heart attack within the next year
and that by exercising you can prevent this from happening
your motivation will be much higher than in the last example
Similarly in another example
if I tell you to do something in order to secure a promotion
or if I tell you to do something or else youll be fired from your job
in which case will you be motivated more?
Most people think that
its okay whether they get something extra or not
they shouldnt suffer any losses
They dont want to lose what they have
The second thing that this theory talks about
is that when were talking about gains and losses
it is all relative
The reference point is different for different people
If a person living in a slum
is working diligently to prepare for a job interview
if he gets the job it will improve his life
On the other hand another person who is the child of a landlord
living comfortably and not lacking money
is preparing for the same job interview
and if he gets the job it wouldnt make much difference to his life
think about it of these two who will feel more motivated?
Now lets see the fourth and the last theory
Hyperbolic Discounting Theory
It basically means that the reward that we can get immediately
well want to work for those rewards
as compared to the rewards that we can get after some time
Theres a Hindi proverb about it too
9 in cash is better than 13 as a contingency
Who can guarantee the future?
You need to hold on to the things that you have now
In contrast to this you will have heard statements like
Dont Be Shortsighted
Look at the larger picture
Have a vision
Think of the future
Thinking about the long term is good
but we are more motivated
when we work on something that guarantees instant gratification
Friends these four theories
have been combined in 2006
to form a metatheory
By Dr Piers Steel and Dr Cornelius J Knig
This combined theory was named the Temporal Motivation Theory
According to this combined theory
your motivation to do a task
will not come from watching a motivational video
you will get the motivation to work
when your personal need
matches the work and the reward of the work
When you expect that you can actually do the task
and win the reward
When the reward you get after completing the task
is higher than your reference line
When the reward means something to you
And finally you want the reward as soon as possible without much delay
If all these factors are combined
you will not procrastinate
This can also be represented as a mathematical formula
If you go a level further from procrastination and motivation
and want to eliminate the habit of wasting time in your life
I have built a 2hour long detailed practical course for it
In it I have shared tips on time management productivity
and overall happiness in life
which I apply in my life
which enables me to do so much
Putting up a Shorts video every day
Regular videos on the main channel
the vlog channel and travelling
Last month when I told you about this course
about 1500 people among you have joined it
and I got such amazing reviews
Many of you said that this course was lifechanging for you
In this course you will get daytoday experiences live sessions
a community chat group trainers to explain things
and a Live QA Session with me
Where you can directly ask me questions
Im happy to announce that the next class will begin on 13th August
So those of you who havent joined the course yet
you can do it now
the link to it is the description below
Not only will there be onesided lectures
but you will also be given regular homework
so that you can apply these techniques to your life
the first 1000 people of you to join
will get a discount of 1000
so dont procrastinate on it
and lets get back to the topic
Some scientists have criticised this theory
saying that this theory doesnt cover everything
Psychologists Tim Pychyl and J R Ferrari
have been against this theory
They claim that if everything related to motivation is so rational
if we use this formula to calculate the motivation to watch a YouTube video
and the motivation to study
obviously the motivation to watch YouTube videos would be higher
So why do people experience guilt over it?
Why do people feel bad when they are doing something
that they are more motivated to do?
These two psychologists argued that
in addition to these factors
there is another factor contributing to procrastination
The factor of Fear of Failure
We are scared of failing
Thats why we procrastinate
They claimed this in 2012
If we set aside the other factors
some people are still not motivated to work
because they are scared that theyd fail in the task
so they put aside the task and start doing something else
So whats the conclusion of all of this?
What is the solution to procrastination?
How do we stop procrastination?
The solution to it can be found in these theories
The new theories that are seen as a counter
are not against the previous theories
The actual reason behind procrastination can be any of these
Sometimes it is low expectations
or the needs not matching
or even the fear of failure
Friends the thing is that once you understand these causes
and you use it to identify the reason you procrastinate
the reason why you put off working on things you shouldnt
Then you can curate a solution for yourself
First of all empty your thoughts and take a pen and paper
And ask yourself
Why are you procrastinating?
Only when you write down the cause
you will be able to find the solution to it
identifying the problem
is half the solution
If you are procrastinating at work
thinking that your task is insignificant
and your lack of motivation
then recall loss aversion
Remind yourself that not doing the task may lead to you being fired
And then think about the consequences of being jobless
If you lack motivation because
even after studying hard you know that you cannot get to the top ranks
then go do something where you are confident
that you can perform well in that field of study
or something that you like a lot
and where you can get good results
If you are preparing for a major exam
and the reward seems very farfetched
Or if youll get the reward only after 2 years
then you need to divide the process into smaller steps
After each step give yourself a small reward
So that you can get some instant gratification
If you are scared about taking an important decision
if you are afraid of failing
remember that not trying is worse than failing
We are scared of failure
because we have so much ego
We are scared that if we fail what would the others say?
If I wanted to be a filmmaker
and went to Mumbai but couldnt become one
what would my friends say?
You went to Mumbai to be a filmmaker
but you couldnt be one
I had warned you against leaving your job
but you didnt listen to me
Many people are scared of such statements
For this we need to understand that
our ego is the most useless thing in life
If we are absorbed with what others say about us
if we keep building our life based on the expectations of other people
we will regret it later
I had talked about regrets earlier in this video
about the regrets people have to deal with later in their lives
Remember you too might have to face those
In 1995 Gilovich and Medvec
came up with the Temporal Theory of Regret
According to this theory
actions may produce greater regret in the short term
but inaction will generate more regret in the long run
If you do something now
you may end up doing something that you will regret in the short term
but not doing something will give you more regret in the long term
If you quit your job and follow your dream
and then fail
you will regret it less than
if you had never left your job
the last obstacle between procrastination and you
are the distractions
Social media your phone
this is the last thing I am talking about
because if the other reasons and obstacles to motivation I told you about
is clear to you
you will hardly if ever be distracted by the distractions
But if you are still distracted by things like social media
you should watch this video
In this I have talked about how you can deal with social media addiction scientifically
Thank you very much!
