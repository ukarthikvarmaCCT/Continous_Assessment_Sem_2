Hello friends
On 24th December 1999
Indian Airlines flight IC 814
Took off from Kathmandu
This flight was headed to Delhi
It usually takes 2 hours to fly from Kathmandu to Delhi
But the passengers and crew members on this flight
Were unaware that for them
reaching Delhi would take a much longer time
5 people hijacked this plane
These hijackers asked for 200 million
from the Indian Government  to free the passengers
They had some additional demands as well
Such as releasing some terrorists from jail
The entire country held their breath for the next 7 days
And watched this unfold on their television screens
This hijacking was the biggest hijacking in Indian history
And the last plane hijacking
Yup thats right friends
Fortunately since then no other plane has been hijacked in India
Come lets understand this entire incident in detail
24 December 1999
An Indian airplane flying from Kathmandu to Delhi
was hijacked today
The plane was carrying 11 crew members
and 179 passengers
We were blindfolded all of us with our heads down
Their safety was our first priority
We have evidence to show that hijackers
were encouraged by Pakistan
A little after this flight took off from Kathmandu
The passengers of this flight were served food
And while they were having lunch
Suddenly 4 masked men stood up
And started taking away the food
They announced that the plane had been hijacked
The hijackers went into the pilots cabin
And with Capt Devi Sharan at gunpoint
He was instructed to keep flying westwards
Actually the hijackers wanted to take this plane to Pakistan
So this plane kept flying beyond Delhi towards Pakistan
Specifically to Lahores airport
But the Pakistani air traffic controllers in Lahore
Strictly forbade the flight from landing in their territory
On the other hand the Indian air traffic controllers
came to know about this hijacking at 440 PM
And interestingly our incumbent Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
And his Principal Secretary Brajesh Mishra
came to know about this one hour later at 520 PM
At 0604 PM the Indian air traffic control
tried to establish communication with flight IC814
Capt Devi Sharan tells them that the plane was running low on fuel
And they werent permitted to land in Lahore
The captain requests the Indian air traffic control
to ask their Pakistani counterparts
To grant them permission to land in Lahore
Because the hijackers were getting frustrated
The hijackers were threatening to kill the passengers
If they werent allowed to land in Pakistan
At 630 in the evening
The Indian High Commission in Pakistan requests Pakistani authorities
To allow the plane to land in Lahore
But they werent granted permission
Meanwhile Capt Devi Sharan tried to talk to the hijackers
To tell them that the plane was running low on fuel
And that they couldnt keep waiting for permission
They had to land somewhere and refuel
He proved successful in convincing the hijackers
And the hijackers agree to have the plane land in Amritsar
For refuelling
At 644 PM the flight starts descending towards Amritsar
Friends the hijackers did not want this to happen
They had hijacked an Indian plane
And to have it land in India
Would give a huge upper hand to the Indian government and authorities
In this crisis this situation was very advantageous for India
The Indian forces could now get better control over the situation
Because the plane was about to land in India
But what happened next turned out to be a historic blunder
Subramanian Swamy describes this incident
What did the Indian authorities do wrong?
There was not one but several mistakes
At 701 PM the flight landed at Amritsar airport
Immediately they request that the flight be refuelled
Amazingly Punjabs Director General of Police
Sarabjit Singh was informed about this hijacking
1 hour earlier around 6 PM
And not through other official sources
But through the TV news
Can you imagine the scale of the communication failure here?
Such an important officer got to know about this hijacking while watching TV
After this hijacking a crisis management group was formed
And a local committee with the purpose of
delaying the plane as much as possible
This would allow more time for the commandos to develop a strategy
And to conduct some operations on the ground
But the hijackers in the plane
Refused to communicate with the local police officials
They wanted to communicate with the officials in Delhi
But this communication couldnt be effective
Captain Devi Sharan requested again to have the plane refuelled
If it wasnt refuelled the hijackers were threatening to attack the passengers
They would start killing the passengers
5 minutes passed
10 minutes 15 minutes
No refuelling was initiated
Hijackers actually attacked a person
Satnam Singh
They used a knife to injure his neck
Once again Captain Devi Sharan requested
To refuel the plane immediately
40 minutes pass like this
By 745 PM the Crisis Management Group formulates a plan
And gave orders to the Punjab Police
They decided to take advantage of the fuel tanker fuelling the plane
to hide some officers of the Punjab Police
So that they could go and puncture the tires of the plane
With damaged tires the plane would not be able to take off again
It was a good plan
But before this plan could be brought into action
The ATC came up with another plan
Why not place a fuel tanker in front of the plane
To block its way?
So a fuel tanker started moving towards the plane
But the driver of the fuel tanker was driving it a bit too fast
So the ATC was worried that the speed of the tanker
May tip off the hijackers that they were planning on doing something
So the driver was asked to drive slowly
And the driver
due to miscommunication or something else
Suddenly stopped the fuel tanker
The hijackers and the captain in the cockpit of the plane
Saw this happening
The hijackers were shocked to see this
First the tanker was moving towards them so fast
And then it stopped suddenly
They figured out something was wrong
This frustrated the hijackers
They gave up on refuelling
And wanted to take the plane back into the air
Without refuelling
Captain Sharan was pressurised into
having the plane take off
By ignoring the fuel tanker
Even if it meant hitting it
They wanted the plane to be airborne
Under pressure Captain Sharan prepared to have the plane take off
While speeding on the runway
He barely avoided hitting the fuel tanker in front of them
There was an accident almost
But it didnt happen and once again the plane was in the air
This happened exactly at 749 PM
The moment when the NSG commandos reached the airport
The operation backfired terribly
The NSG Commandos didnt get the chance to take any action
And most importantly the plane was still not refuelled
While taking off Capt Devi Sharan sent a message to the ATC
We are all dying
Lahore is just 50 km from Amritsar
Once again this flight turned towards Pakistan
Once again the ATC in Pakistan denied permission to land this plane in Lahore
They were worried that the hijackers would force the pilots to land the plane in Lahore
So all lights were turned off at Pakistans airport
All the navigational aids and lights in the airport were turned off
So that even if they wanted to land the plane
it would be exceedingly difficult without lights
But Capt Sharan was under so much pressure from the hijackers
He couldnt care whether the runway was visible or not
He had to land the plane no matter where it was
The place descended slowly
And suddenly Capt Sharan realised
That they were about to crash land on a highway
Seeing this he made a final request to Pakistans ATC
That they will crash land on the highway
If they werent allowed to land at the airport
Hearing this finally the ATC at Lahore agreed
And this plane landed in Lahore at 807 PM
India tells Pakistans Airport Officials
To prevent this plane from taking off again
India planned to send the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad
G Parthasarathy to negotiate with the hijackers
At this airport in Pakistan this plane was finally refuelled
And to prevent this plane from taking off once again
Lights were turned off once again
And their commandos surrounded the plane
Apparently the Pakistani forces tried to negotiate with the hijackers
They asked them to release the children and female passengers
But these negotiations failed
Hijackers were frustrated that their negotiations couldnt reach a solution
Their demands werent fulfilled
Another passenger was attacked
Rupin Katyal
A 25yearold man from Gurgaon
Returning with his wife from their honeymoon
Rupin passed away later
One passenger Rupin Katyal
returning from his honeymoon was brutally stabbed to death
Pakistan was tasked with providing a helicopter to the Indian High Commissioner
So that he could reach Lahore for the negotiations as quickly as possible
But the helicopter was provided 3 hours late
By the time he reached Lahore
He found that the plane had taken off once again
How was this possible when all the lights at the airport were switched off?
And the plane was surrounded by the Commandoes
How could the plane still take off?
We do not have much information about this
But we get some clues later on in the story
The flight was directed from Lahore to Oman
But even there their permission to land was rejected
The next landing of this flight was at Dubais Al Minhad Air Base
Around 300 AM
After relentless negotiation the hijackers finally released 26 passengers here
A special relief aircraft of Indian Airlines was called to Dubai
To take the passengers back to India
The then Civil Aviation Minister Sharad Yadav was present on this flight
And was accompanying the passengers to take them back to their homes safely
Some important information was revealed by the passengers returning from Dubai
about this hijacked flight
It was found that in the plane
Men were segregated from women and children
And everyone was blindfolded
So that no one could see anything
Some women claimed that the hijackers were decently behaving towards them
And were quite affectionate with the children
They said that there were 5 hijackers
And they had code names
Their leader called himself the Chief
And the four others were Burger Doctor Shankar and Bhola
Obviously these were the fake names they were using for the hijacking
But we later found that their real names were
Most of the hijackers were from Pakistan
Captain and hostages later revealed that
Hijacker Burger kept people calm on the flight
By singing making jokes and simply by talking to them
It was quite surprising that some hijackers were behaving like this
Because there were also stories of how people werent being given food
A woman claimed that her child was crying because of hunger
And the hijackers shouted at her to have the child shut up
1 day passed
The passengers in the plane were in worse conditions
Food and water were running low
The toilets were in terrible condition
The plane took off once again
And this time it flew to Afghanistan
26th December at 8 in the morning
The plane landed at Kandahar International Airport
After the landing Talibans authorities present here
Offered to mediate between the hijackers and India
Thats right at this time Taliban was in power in Afghanistan
But India didnt recognise the Talibani government
So India sent an Indian High Commissioner from Islamabad to Kandahar
To negotiate
The plane and its passengers remained there for the next 6 days
6 days
Even after everything they were trapped there for 6 days
They had no idea about what would happen next
What their future held
If theyd be killed there
The Indian government was suspicious of Talibans real intentions
Because this plane was surrounded by Talibans members
carrying weapons
Taliban claims to have taken the action against the hijackers
So that the hijackers wouldnt behave recklessly
they had placed their members all around the plane as security
But Indian analysts believe that
this was done so that India couldnt carry out military operations against the hijackers
Ajit Doval was a part of a special team
that was sent to Kandahar to negotiate with the terrorists
They claim that the hijackers were getting support from active ISI in Kandahar
That they were guaranteed to get a safe exit
They claim that without ISIs involvement
India could have better resolved this hijacking
Ajit Dovals story is very interesting on its own

Now lets return to our topic
Friends the scenario in India was very tense
It was in 1999
The year of the Kargil War
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee tried
to have peaceful relations with Pakistan
But the efforts failed
And this hijack was a sensitive issue for the Prime Ministers image
Many things are still not clear about this case
Even now we do not know
how the security was breached at Kathmandus airport
Its said that Dawood Ibrahims Nepal network was used for this
The mishandling by the Indian authorities
gave rise to a theory that Ill discuss later in this video
Getting back to our timeline now
the hijackers at Kandahar demanded 200 million
They wanted to get 165 billion
Additionally they demanded the release of 36 prisoners
Apart from this they also demanded
the dead body of Sajjad Afghani the founder of HarkatUlMujahideen
These were outrageous demands
They made high demands and asked for a lot of money
But in India the government was under different pressure
On 26th December External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh
was at a press conference regarding this hijacking
The government has been
in constant touch
with the negotiating team
Suddenly a mob of people disrupted this press conference
They were the family members and relatives of the passengers of the plane
At this press conference they ask the External Affairs minister
to fulfil the demand of the hijackers
so that their loved ones could be safe
They refer to the December 1989 incident
10 years ago when Union Minister Mufti Mohammad Saeeds daughter
Rubiya Saeed was freed after
the government released militants
They stressed the importance of civilian lives
they demanded that the government take action
to get their loved ones back into the country immediately
They believed that the safety of the passengers of the plane should be the number 1 priority
Their safety trumped all else
Whether thats a demand for the release of a prisoner
or money everything else was a second priority
Everything was happening in front of External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh
But the Indian negotiators were yet to reach Kandahar
They reached the next day on 27th December
The team of negotiators was led by Vivek Katju
He was the Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs then
And Home Ministrys official Ajit Doval
The same day the pressure on the government intensified
when the relatives of some hostages gatecrashed
into Rajiv Gandhi Bhawan
where the Crisis Management Group was in a meeting
Some people were protesting in front of the Prime Ministers residence
Taliban clearly stated that they wont allow Indian forces to conduct rescue operations
But they do offer to negotiate on behalf of India
And the negotiations went on so
Talibans leader Maulana Mohammad Umar
told a Pakistani newspaper that
the hijackers should either leave the plane
or lay down their weapons
The negotiations lasted for days
The team of Indian negotiators were placed there
with the Taliban in between them and the hijackers
Ultimately the demands of the hijackers could be narrowed down by a lot
Only 3 prisoners were to be released instead of 36
The credit for bringing down the demands of the hijackers
is given to both the Indian negotiators and Taliban
Coming back to the hijacking by the 5th day
the toilets in the plane were overflowing
People were losing hope
The RAW Chief back then A S Dulat
reached Jammu on 30th December
He tried to convince Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah
to release 2 prisoners
Farooq Abdullah was very reluctant
He argued that this would have a negative impact later on
As we see now it did
But eventually the pressure was so intense back then
That he was forced to abide by the demands
The prisoners were transported to Delhi
And were placed on a flight with External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh
Off they went to Kandahar
The next day 31st December
The demands of the hijackers were met
and 3 prisoners were released in Kandahar
On the other hand the hijackers
released the passengers of the plane
At this point in time the Indian team had expected that
the hijackers would be arrested by Taliban
But they didnt do this
Talibans supreme leader and another Talibani member
put the hijackers and the released terrorists in a vehicle
and drove towards the border
Towards Pakistans border
By this point in time it was clear to India
about Pakistans involvement in this hijacking
2 of the released persons have surfaced there
Only goes to confirm
that Pakistan is neck deep
in this dirty game of hijacking
Harkat was a Pakistanbased militant group
active in PoK
and 33 prisoners out of the 36 whose release was demanded
were Pakistanis
These hijackers safely crossed the border to reach Pakistan
On the other hand the passengers were finally safe
Several passengers were injured
and most of them were starving
On 31st December they came home
The plane that was hijacked
was retired in 2001
because it was already a 20yearold plane
The blame for this incident obviously falls on the hijackers
And the stakeholders supporting them
Whether thats Taliban or the Pakistani forces
But along with this the incumbent government
was also criticised
How terribly they failed at dealing with this crisis
When this plane was in Amritsar
it was a golden opportunity for the Indian forces
to regain control of the plane
But the big blunders committed by the government
could be labelled as a communication gap
But as a result of these blunders
the JaisheMohammad group was later formed
And we witnessed these attacks
Another shocking reveal from Amritsars controversy surfaced
The RAW Chief tells us
how among the passengers in the plane
Shashi Bhushan Singh Tomar was one of them
The brotherinlaw of N K Singh
And N K Singh was Prime Minister Vajpayees Secretary
Its said that the plane was allowed to take off from Amritsar
to ensure Tomars safety
If Tomars safety played even a minute part in Amritsars lost chance
it was a shameful act by the authorities
The other shocking thing was that
many of the top leaders of the nation came to know about the hijacking
through the TV news
Instead of their communication channels
Such as LK Advani
the then Home Minister
He says that he came to know about this incident
through the news programs
Instead of being informed by the Crisis Management Group
At the end of this story there is some good news
And its that since then
there has been no other hijacking incident in the country
The regulations and processes have been made so strict that
it has become extremely difficult to hijack any plane
What are these safety measures?
lets discuss them in detail in some future video
