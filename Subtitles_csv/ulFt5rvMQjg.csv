Hello friends!
Recently a film called The Kerala Story was released
which is being talked about a lot
In this film it is shown how
a secret plot is underway in Kerala
to forcefully convert innocent women to Islam
and then they are being sent to ISS
According to this film and the director of this film
this has been done to approximately 32000 girls
who are now buried in the deserts of Syria and Yemen
What is the real story behind this?
How much truth is in it?
Come lets try to find out in this video
The Kerala Story
32000 girls like me
were forced to convert
and now theyre buried in the deserts of Syria and Yemen
About 100 years ago
Adolf Hitler the dictator of Germany wrote a book
called Mein Kampf
In this book he talked about
a propaganda technique called Big Lie
Hitler said that to manipulate people you need to lie so outrageously to
make people think that no one can make up such an outrageous lie
To make them think that there must be some truth in it
When an outrageous lie is told with so much confidence
some people believe it to be true
People think that no one can lie so much
Additionally another propaganda technique as told by
Hitlers propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels
Goebbels said that repetition is also very important here
Keep repeating this big lie again and again
Repeat this big lie so many times that
people get to hear the same lie from 4 different sources
By doing this people become more convinced
A third technique is said to be the HalfTruth
Sometimes add in some element of truth in your speeches
Because nowadays some people can easily identify big liars
When someone says that no one can lie so outrageously all the time
someone might counter that by showing that the speaker is a total fraud
Someone who mightve been an Olympic champion
had lying been an Olympic sport
For those who are not convinced by the big lies
half truth is supposed to convince them
Why am I telling you all these propaganda techniques?
Because in this video youll see
how these 3 techniques have been used to mislead people
The Kerala Story films director Sudipto Sen was asked
which true incidents inspired this film
He said many things here
First he said that in 2010
Keralas former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy
he gave a statement in Keralas Assembly
You can Google this statement
and you will see a report from India Today
2500 women Islam Kerala Oommen Chandy
seems right
Then it was said that another former Chief Minister of Kerala
VS Achuthanandan had once said that
Kerala is going to become an Islamic state in the next 20 years
If you search this on Google
and you see this video on YouTube or Twitter
You think oh this is also right
Then in the teaser of the film it is shown that
a girl says that she is Fatima
and that she is imprisoned in Afghanistans jail
You search this on Google
and you see a news article from The Hindu
Fatima Afghanistans jail Islamic State
Was that right too?
Friends these were some good examples
of halftruth
Most people skim through the headlines
and dont go into detail
Lets talk about the first article
This article was published in India Today in 2012
Keralas former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy
informed the state legislature
that between 2006 to 2012
2667 women converted to Islam
Approximately 2500 women in 6 years
But the thing to note is
did he ever use the term forced conversions?
He said that they will not allow any forced conversions in their state
and neither will they tolerate hate campaigns against Muslims
with accusations of Love Jihad
Was it mentioned anywhere
that these converted women were joining ISS?
Not at all
Lets see the second citation
The interview of the former Chief Minister VS Achuthanandan
He was the Chief Minister of Kerala from 2006 to 2011
The video that is being circulated from back then
was uploaded by Sunshine Pictures
The same company which made this film
First of all
they messed with the English subtitles
The words that are being said by him
and the subtitles that appear here are not the same
Secondly here VS Achuthanandan
was strongly criticizing PFI saying that
the PFI was trying to influence the youth of other religions
by paying them to marry Muslim women
ISS is not mentioned here either
Secondly its been 13 years since this statement
Kerala as a state is still as safe and secular
as it was 13 years ago
Now lets see the next article from June 2021
This article talks about 4 women from Kerala
who went to Afghanistan with their husbands
to join the Islamic State of Khorasan Province
between 2016 and 2018
Their husbands were killed in various attacks
Their names are Nimisha alias Fathima Isa
Sonia Sebastian alias Ayisha
Merrin Jacob alias Mariyam
and Reffeala
If you look at NIAs list from 2016
of the 20 most wanted Indians in Islamic State
you will see the names of these 4 women here
Additionally there are 2 more women
Ajmala and Shamasia
Their husbands were cousins
You can see the photos of the husbands of these 6 women here
3 of these 6 women were already Muslims
2 converted to Islam from Christianity
And 1 converted to Islam from Hinduism
So only one of these women was originally Hindu
Her name was Nimisha Nair
Was Nimisha Nair trapped by a Muslim man in a case of love jihad?
To find out the answer lets see
who is Nimishas husband
Eeza is a man who converted to Islam from Christianity
His old name was Bexon Vincent
Bexons brother Bestin
also converted to Islam from Christianity
And he too was the husband of one of these 4 women
So both the brothers and their wives
were all converts and brainwashed
Recently the Indian government
denied these four women permission to get back to India
You can watch the video interviews of three of these women
of Nimisha Sonia Sebastian and Reffeala
on YouTube online
on the YouTube channel StratNews Global
They gave an interview in 2020
And there you can see how these women looked
how they talked and their behaviour
When there was a caliphate
when I was there
I was happy there
I can never say that
Khilafa caliphate was wrong
That it was wrong
I cant say that because
I had a comfortable life here
Anyone watching this video can see
how brainwashed and radicalized these women still are
But the main character of the film The Kerala Story
constantly tries to evoke sympathy
The helplessness and innocence shown in the film
theres perhaps not even a glimpse of it in the videos of real life
I want to ask you
will you have sympathy for these real life women?
Or will you call them brainwashed idiots?
Would you want them to remain in Afghanistans jail
or would you want the Indian government to bring them back to India
only to put them in Indian jail?
I leave this question to you
Comment below with your opinion
Strategic News Global Report tells us that
the 20 people mentioned in the 2016 NIA chargesheet
were very interconnected with each other
when it comes to radicalization
17 of them came from a single district
From Kasaragod district in Kerala
A 2020 report from the Hindustan Times stated that
some more people joined later
so in total there were 22 people from Kasaragod
This article in India Today from 2016 states that
the trend shows that not only single youths are joining ISS
but the whole family
including husband wife and even the children
have gone and joined ISS
It is also mentioned in the article that
most of the ISS recruits before this
were from Maharashtra Karnataka and Telangana
Not from Kerala
But this Strat News Global Report goes on to say that
by 2018 60 Indians had travelled to Afghanistan
Of which 26 were males
13 women and 21 children
After knowing all of this it can be clearly said that
there is definitely a problem here
People are being radicalized brainwashed
to join ISS
New modes of communication have opened up through the internet
In 2019 Union Minister of State for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy said that
Indian investigators have found that
ISS is using the dark web and encrypted platforms
to radicalize people and recruit t3rrrists
But the question here is
how big is this problem?
The film said that this has already happened to 32000 women in Kerala
But lets see the statistics
Vladimir Voronkov
the Undersecretary General of the United Nations Office of Counter Terrrism
He said that from 110 countries
nearly 40000 foreign t3rrrist fighters
went to Syria and Iraq to join the conflict
40000 individuals from 110 countries
Another estimate was given by the 2018 study by
the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization of Kings College London
41490 people from 80 different countries
are affiliated with ISS
79 of them are men
On the basis of these two reports
we can arrive at an estimate
there are around 4000042000 foreign t3rrrists
who have gone to join ISS from all over the world
So how many of them are from India?
The Bureau of CounterTerrrism of the US
published country reports in 2020
It stated that by September 2020
the NIA had investigated 34 cases of t3rrrism
and arrested 160 people related to ISS in India
Lets see another source for doublechecking
Observer Research Foundation published a paper in October 2019
They said that the number of proISS cases in India
between 2014 and 2018 was around 180200
This estimate of 200 people
doesnt include only those people
who actually left India to join ISS
It also includes those people who spread ISS propaganda
on the internet in India
Lets look at a third source
In 2019 the Indian Home Ministry said that
this number was at 155
The next question is that
since these are the cases from all over India
How many cases are there in Kerala?
Out of the total 180200 cases
40 cases are said to be from Kerala
200 from India and 40 from Kerala
But this number doesnt tell us how many people actually went to join ISS
Because the number includes all people affiliated with ISS
and people who spread propaganda
How many people actually left India to join ISS?
US Department of State report revealed that
there were around 66 known Indianorigin fighters
who were affiliated with ISS
as of November 2020
You heard it right
only 66
2018s Strat News global report also gave a figure close to 60
so both numbers are quite close
Out of these 60
how many were women?
Approximately 13 women
How many women were from Kerala?
Only 6 women were from Kerala
Out of these 6 how many women
were converted to Islam from other religions?
3 women
Out of these 3 2 were Christians
and only 1 was a Hindu
The events shown in the film
happened to 3 women in real life
but not in the manner
shown in the film
However the film claims that
this happened to 32000 women
This is the Big Lie friends
This lie is so big that
if a common man hears it
he will think that even if not 32000
there must still be some truth in it
This must have happened to a few 1000 women
If not thousands
then it must have happened to hundreds of women
No! Only 3 women
Now some of you might say
whether its 32000 or 3 what difference does it make?
The story remains the same
Whats the problem?
There are many problems
First if instead of 32000 the meagre number of 3 was used
then the whole concept of the film fails
Saying that there is a secret love jihad conspiracy going on here
to forcibly convert girls and send them to ISS
and as a result of this conspiracy
only 3 women suffered
then it means that these are individual cases
There is no conspiracy here
Second to generalize and exaggerate things to this level
is simply stupid
If this was done with any other incident
you will say that it is utter nonsense
Let me use an example
Over the last few months
there were 3 such cases of
an Indian citizen urinating on a copassenger in an airplane
Now imagine a country like America or Japan
makes a film called The India Story
and the film shows how Indians
always urinate on copassengers in airplanes
32000 such incidents too place
where Indians have urinated on someone
How will you feel about it?
You will say that it is utter nonsense
That they are trying to defame the country
But if on the other hand the filmmaker says
that 32000 was an exaggerated number
but it did happen thrice
so making the film was justified
What would be your response in that case?
Does it make any sense?
Similarly the entire state of Kerala is being defamed for 3 individual cases
When the director of the film was asked about it
about the source of the 32000 number
he evaded the questions
While talking to Alt News he said that
only after the release of the film would he share his data
based on which he used the number 32000
He told The Quint that
asking such questions doesnt make any difference
It is very cliched
When the film was screened in JNU
he said that the 32000 number was an arbitrary number
And when the matter reached the court
he removed 32000 from the description of the film
replacing it with 3
The truth is that
the story of these three women was worth telling
Had this story been told
without lies and propaganda
Every person who is brainwashed
and recruited in ISS is a potential threat
But how big is this problem in India?
If you compare it with other countries
you will find it shocking
In India as I told you this number is around 66
the victims of ISS propaganda
According to the 2016 data
in the former Soviet republics there were 7000 such people
2500 people from Russia
1700 people in France
760 people in Germany
The number of victims in the UK was also around 700
The population of all these countries is much less than India
But the number of people who fell victim to ISS
is much higher in these countries
And here it is also worth noting that
India has the 3rd largest Muslim population in the world
So compared to countries like France Germany and UK
more Muslims live in India
But still fewer ISS recruits are seen in India
If you look at the ratio here
ISS recruits per million people
India has a ratio of 05 per million
It is 36 times more in France
at 18 per million
Belgium has a ratio of 40 per million
and in Jordan it is 315 per million
Was this mentioned in the film even once?
Some people truly enjoy
watching a state of their country being defamed
based on lies
The ORF report held that
academics and experts often ask
why did so few Muslims from India join ISS?
There are many factors for this
First the superb response of the Indian agencies
Very few of you may know about Operation Pigeon
Our agencies like NIA and IB
carried out a mission
in which they identified 350 vulnerable Malayali youth
and ran a deradicalization program
to save our youth from this extremism and radicalization
A great job by our officers
But you know whats shameful?
Our Prime Minister in his election speeches
instead of promoting good work
the PM promotes this film of lies
The film based on t3rrrist plots
The Kerala Story is nowadays
is highly talked about
This reminds me of another historic operation
by the Indian forces against ISS
An immensely risky operation
on which the film Tiger Zinda Hai was made

And Im thankful to them for sponsoring this video
And now lets get back to the topic
If Prime Minister Modi wanted
he could have told people about this inspirational story
But no he had to promote a propaganda film
The second reason as claimed by former diplomat Talmiz Ahmad
is Indias syncretic culture and tradition
The Unity in Diversity in India
Muslims live harmoniously with Hindus and Christians in India
And thats why they rejected extreme ideologies
In 2015 when it was found that
only 29 Indians had joined ISS
a report stated that ISS itself
considered Indian recruits to be inferior
ISS believed that the Islam practised in India
is a very soft version
It is a liberal version of Islam
Third many Muslim clerics have also played a positive role here
In March 2009 Darul Uloom Deoband issued a fatwa
declaring India as Dar alAman
A country where militant Jihad is prohibited
Similarly in 2015 a joint fatwa was issued
by 70000 Indian Muslim scholars
against ISS Taliban AlQaeda and other t3rrrist organizations
The real Kerala story here
is something to be proud of
Compared to the rest of the world
how few Muslims from India joined ISS
And Kerala is a living example of unity in diversity
People of different religions live together peacefully
This is the reason why Kerala is the number one state across many indicators
Number one in education
number one in healthcare
number one in human development index
But then our politicians use these fake stories to defame Kerala
In February this year
when Home Minister Amit Shah was campaigning for the elections
said in Karnataka that
Kerala is right next to Karnataka
Heavily implying on how dangerous Kerala is
Maligning Kerala is not the only propaganda in this film
Another Big Lie is Love Jihad
In the film it is shown that
there are forceful religious conversions
What is the truth?
In 2017 the Kerala government
submitted a list of 90 cases to the NIA
to investigate whether there was a Love Jihad angle or not
NIA examined 11 of those cases
and concluded in 2018
that although PFI facilitated conversion
but not a single case was found
where a person of whatever gender was being forced to convert
If one proof is not enough look at the other
The Union Home Ministry said the same in 2020
In 2020 Minister of State for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy
told Lok Sabha in a written reply that
no case of Love Jihad has been reported
by any central agency
This conspiracy theory of Love Jihad
is a Big Lie told to you
using different angles
Politicians use it in their speeches
you get these WhatsApp forwards from WhatsApp University
talking about Love Jihad
And the propaganda news channels use Love Jihad as news
This big lie is repeated so many times that
people begin to think that there must be some truth in it
The same thing that I said in the beginning
The whole concept of Love Jihad
is not only used to defame Muslims
but the concept goes against women
Think about it
people who believe that
a woman can be easily manipulated by a man
what kind of people are they?
Are women cattle?
Doesnt a woman have a brain?
Anyone can come and say anything
and women will meekly follow around like cattle
Whether its a Hindu woman a Muslim woman
a Christian woman or a woman of any other religion
All women should come together
to tell their religious leaders to mind their own businesses
Women have brains
If a man tries to forcefully convert a woman
she can go to the police
And the law states that
if someone tries to forcefully convert another person
he will have to go to jail
But the question is
how many people are being converted in India?
Sometimes some Christian missionaries
or these Hindu priests or Muslim clerics
become a little overactive in their preaching
and the balance shifts a bit
Like this 2016 news article
where the leader of Vishwa Hindu Parishad said that
their organization has converted 750000 people
back to Hinduism in 10 years
But if these religious leaders from different religions dont interfere
and people want to convert of their own will
then you get to see a balance
Look at the April 2021 report
506 people registered that they want to change their religion
with the Kerala government
47 of these people
converted from Christianity or Islam to Hinduism
So its not like we are seeing more conversions to one religion
2021 survey by the Pew Research Center
showed the same thing
More than 30000 people were surveyed
and it was found that only 07 of people
left Hinduism and adopted other religions
And 08 of people left other religions and adopted Hinduism
We need to understand that
merely for some political power
a very dirty game is being played here
Big lies are being propagated
conspiracy theories are being developed
so that Hindus Muslims and Christians
can be provoked into fighting each other
Some political parties benefit a lot if
people are filled with hatred for people from other religions
In the beginning it was only WhatsApp forwards
then the propagandaenabling media started doing this
And now propaganda films are being made to mislead people
100 years ago this used to happen during Hitlers rule as well
Many propaganda films were made
Many such films
which distorted history of their own will
defamed Jews and
glorified German Aryans
Such big lies were propagated in those films
They were repeated to convince people
In the greed for power and money
these people are trying to break the country from inside out
They who spread so much vile hatred
should remember one thing
it is possible that they be successful
in spreading fear violence and hatred
But they need to remember that
this country has gone through a lot
Whenever any power tried to divide the country
the people of the country came together and bounced back
At last Id like to say that
If you want to watch a film on this topic
watch this Swedish TV series on Netflix The Caliphate
No one has been defamed in that film
no lies or propaganda has been spread
In fact it tells a true story
of how ISS recruited some young girls in Sweden
Its a thrilling show
And thank you very much!
