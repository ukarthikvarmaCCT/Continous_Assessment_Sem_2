My friend Mac is about to experience the scariest moment of his life
Im just going to let you know Im not afraid of anything
Well see  You cannot scare me
Seal him up
You have to survive 10 minutes with a thousand spiders to move on
Release the spiders
Start the timer
The reason were doing this is because
Mack said no matter how hard I tried I cant scare him
Would you say youre scared now?
Getting there a little bit
A little bit?  Yeah
And this is only one of many fears Mack will face in this video
Oh good
And if he can successfully face all of the fears he will win 800000
Im not going to lie
this was way more gnarly than I thought it would be
Three two one
Lift it up Lift it up
Oh yeah
Congratulations on passing the first challenge
Lets go
But Mack has to finish all of these fears
if he wants to win the 800000 prize
Mack I know youre blindfolded but trust me
Just walk up this ramp
Raise us up
Why are you taking a knee?
What is?
Stand up Stand up Youre fine Youre fine
No no no no
All right Jimmy
Okay you can hold on to it
Thats cute
Oh my God!
Mack take off your blindfold
Welcome to challenge number two
The next fear is the fear of heights
Youre going to stand on the end of that plank
unclip this so youll be connected to nothing
Nah dude
Press that button and then freefall 200 feet
and without knowing how trust Ill catch you
No! No!
Youre shaking
Yeah of course Im shaking
Im going to fall off of this without a harness on
Yeah  I cant even see the ground
Be very careful
Mack Im just going to tell you
even though you cant see the ground you are very very high
Oh my God Mack
All you have to do is unclip it and press that button
Oh my
I want you to look at me in the eyes right now
and tell me that Im going to fall and somethings going to catch me
Something will break your fall
I promise
Oh my
Youre literally attached to nothing
Oh my God
The clip is gone  Oh my God
You dont have to do it
If you want to
you can tap out and just admit that you are wrong and
you do get scared
No way
God dude
I would have to say you look pretty scared
Oh my God
Five four
three two
Lets go!
I cant believe you did it
Hes a psycho
And if youre wondering who my psychotic friend Mack is
hes actually a contestant from a previous challenge video
And sadly he ended up losing 800000
But now he is on challenge three of six
to attempt to win that money back
Here we are
Yeah  The next challenge
Whatd you get? A 5 car and put 800000 inside of it?
As you can see this car is pointed towards a lake
Im guessing youre going to want me to drive the car into the lake?
No That would be dangerous
As you can see theres no gas pedal
Obviously you cant drive it in the lake
Yeah Im so stupid
Why would I think that I can drive it into the lake?
Yeah Yeah  Stupid Yeah
Which is why were going to drop him in the lake
Bring in the crane!
Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy
It is getting real now Okay
Oh my God
Oh my God
All right Mack listen up and listen good
Once we drop you at this lake the car will quickly begin to sink
And in the back seat is
the 800 grand youve been competing for divvied up into eight duffel bags
However many bags you can save from this sinking car determines
how much money youll continue competing for in this video
And whatever you leave behind is gone forever
Oh my gosh dude
I will never tell you that Im scared
but Im about as close as you can be right now to that feeling
I can tell
Before we drop your car Im going to give you a one offer
If you quit right now and admit I scared you
Ill give you 100000
And we call it even
All right
Hes not going to take it
Theres not a gosh darn chance  I knew that was going
Hey Nolan take that I knew he was going to do this
I lost it all last time
Its not happening again
Oh my God
Drop him!
Hey Mack! Youve got about 20 seconds to break out of that car
before it sinks under the water
Mack the car is going under
Hurry up
Oh God
That car is gone
That sunk so fast
Oh my God Hes out Hes alive
Hey Mack!
Nolan go grab that bag from him
Somebody grab this
The scariest part about this challenge is every second
the car sinks deeper into the water making it harder to get to
and harder to see
So if Mack wants to keep all of the prize money
He really needs to be moving as fast as possible
But as you can see thats not going to be easy
Nolan come here Take it
Mack continued saving bag
Oh my God
After bag after bag
Mack youre crazy
But on top of the fact that the car is sinking deeper and deeper
What Mack hasnt realized yet is that the last two bags of money
are actually seatbelted into the back seat of the car
Dude Mack could be in an action movie honestly
Well he was like a borderline Olympic swimmer earlier in his life
which is why I did this fear
Yeah but its like 40 feet down and the water is freezing cold
How can you hold your breath out?
He got another bag
Well you got 700000 on the boat
Just stop now Just stop now
Just leave it on the bottom of lake
We can do the next  No
All right He doesnt care
At this point
the car was literally at the bottom of this 45 foot deep lake
making it almost impossible for Mack to retrieve the last 100000
Yeah you know I really cannot
Its black down there Theres nothing
Are you officially calling it?
I cant see the car Jimmy Its gone yes
The boats tilting
You are very athletic
Do you like this video better or the other video better?
Dude this video is like 10 times as intense
I know
And even though this looks very crazy theres actually seven
safety divers on standby to make sure Mack didnt die
Your prize is now 700 grand
but from here on out its all or nothing
Mack has to face the three remaining fears
to walk out of this with his 700 grand
This one might be the hardest one  Okay
Is it grosser than spiders?
Just come on in
Inside this room is a metal box
In order to progress
youll need to reach inside the box and pull out whats inside
And before you put your hand in the box
were going to need you to sign this
It just basically says that
you cant sue me if anything in there hurts you
Just sign right there
All right we got it signed
What is it like an animal or something?
There are things in this box
Just step up here
You put your hand in one of these holes
And theres a thing in here you need to pull out
Dude that is freaky as Okay
Im just going to make sure its moving
Stop  Okay go for it
Clearly it has not touched him yet
No matter what once you grab onto it you have to pull it out
What you grabbed
is our brand new Feastable bars
We got all new branding and a better tasting formula
Lets try it together  I am not going to go soft on you
Im going to tell you honestly what I think
Okay thats pretty good
The new formula is milkier creamier
We have our all new crunch flavor the milk chocolate flavor
almond flavor my personal favorite and peanut butter
These new and improved Feastables bars are rolling out now
Give us a couple of days to get them on the shelves
of your local Walmart Target 7Eleven
And I cannot wait to see what you think of them
All right Mack you ready for the next fear?
Jimmy Ive been in this exact same room
and Ive had a bunch of money on the line before
Ill tell you what
If you give me 500 grand right now Ill walk
Do you guys hear this man?
Jimmy  Who asked for 500000?
400 grand?  No
Hear me out
If you said 200 maybe 250 I would have considered it
How about 350?  No
All right lets go
Next challenge
I knew hed break
All right I mightve lied
That one wasnt actually that hard
But this next one is actually based on one of the scariest things
Ive ever done
Theres no way
How about quickly he pieced it together?
Oh no no no no no Theres actually no way
Come on  There is actually no way Jimmy
Is it that obvious what it is?
What gave it away? The tombstone with your name?
Oh Jesus
For the next challenge we are going to bury you alive for 24 hours
No way dude
And you can get out whatever you want
but you dont know what time it is
And if you leave before the 24 hour mark youll lose everything
Thats a good fear
For once Im on the other side
Yeah bro!
Oh my gosh
It might get a little cold
Nolan dont mess it up please
Ill try not to
This is from my nightmares man
It feels wrong being on the other side but also fun
What the
Oh this is so freaky
The funny thing is that the timer hasnt even started yet
because you arent fully buried
It feels wrong saying this but can you bury me faster?
As you wish Mack!
Bring in the extra hand
Stop it stop it stop stop stop stop
Lets officially start the timer
Looks like 24 hours just started
and Im already freaked
so this aint going to be good
Mack see that rope above your head? Can you pull it for me real quick?
Is this a trick?  No
Next time you pull that bell we will dig you up
And if it does not say above 24 hours you lose everything
I will burn your house down
And also the 700000
Yeah I was like everything?
Everything Sweet dreams Macketh!
All right dont throw the walkie talkie
Was it that predictable?
I already know they threw it and Im not even up there
Theres so much more fun to be on this side of it
And to make sure Mack doesnt die in his own grave
Hes going to be wearing this wristband
that directly tells us his heart rate and vitals
And no it does not give him any way of knowing what time it is
Basically I need to figure out how to keep track of the time
Heres my strategy
I could try to stay awake for 2 hours sleep
for 10 hours and then I would be halfway done with the challenge
and I could just do that twice and that would be good
With Macks plan now in place
his first step was to pass the time for the next 2 hours
Well its no Feastable bar
but I guess that makes hunger stop
But it was pretty obvious he was quickly getting bored
Dude you got to be honest theres not much going on inside this room
Thats the whole point
And Mack being bored this early
is a pretty telltale sign that he may not be too good at this
because already
within 45 minutes Macks idea of time was horrendously off
I think its been about 2 hours
Im going to try to get about
10 hours of sleep which should put me at the halfway mark
Even though the pro to sleeping is that itll help Mack past time faster
First night sleeping in the coffin
The con is its very difficult for him to keep track
of how long hes been buried especially when hes not even able
to stay asleep for more than 30 minutes at a time
I have no idea what time it is right now
Im a little creeped out
Hopefully for the love of God its been over 12 hours
I think thats where were at
And because
when I did the challenge I was constantly woken up by my friends
Jimmy Jam
I thought Id give Mack the same joyful experience
Wake up Mack Are you okay?
Dude you look like you just got hit by a truck
Kind of feels like I did just get hit by a truck
If I was to legitimately guess how many hours in I am
I think its like
The longer Mack stayed in the coffin
the less he seemed to know what time it was
It might be hour 16
And because we like to build a lot of suspense on this channel
for the remainder of this fear
youre not going to know how long hes been in there either
And even though Mack wanted to ensure
that he was going to be there long enough
it was clear that claustrophobia was getting to him
Being in this coffin is scary
And the longer Im in here the worse I feel
Its a crazy feeling
But eventually when we saw Mack begin to grab that rope
we knew
he was thinking about ringing that bell
Thats the face of somebody thats about to ring this bell soon
Theres no way its been under 24 hours
God Im nervous
Ive been in one of these videos before
And I lost everything
And the only reason I even am back here at all
and got a second chance is actually because of you guys
Me screwing up that second chance all comes down to
if I know for a fact its been 24 hours
I really hope Im not making a mistake right now
Buddy pal how you doing?
Jimmy Im pretty nervous
I dont want to accidentally reveal the time so no comment
Jimmy I dont know how you do this for seven days dude
I do not feel well in here
Have you got to the point where you start
to lose blood flow in your legs
and you feel like your back is going to fall out of your body?
Jimmy Im thinking about pulling this thing
No comment
Jimmy Ill give you 50 bucks back if you tell me what time it is
No comment
All right I got a comment for you
Just get a shovel ready all right?
Oh my gosh hes about to do it
This is it
Stop the timer
And now that Mack has made his decision
There was just one last thing I had to do
Do you mind if I tell them about Shopify while we unbury you?
You have got to be kidding
Shopify is a platform that helps entrepreneurs
get started down the path they want
Sometimes starting a business can be scary
like getting covered in spiders or being buried alive
I can tell you you do not want to be buried alive
But Shopify is here to help
If I hadnt started my own business I wouldnt have been able
to go to all the crazy places like Antarctica
and make videos like these for you guys
And just like billions of other people have done with Shopify
You can get started today on your business right now
Mack you want to know how long you were in there?
I have a feeling youre not going to tell me until you dig me up
You are correct
And one of the perks of owning my own business is
I can do fun things like send one of my friends to the Superbowl
Mack Karl and Nolan each have their very own football for sale
and whoevers football sells the most
Im going to give you tickets to the Super Bowl
and Im going to bury the other one alive
All that matters is that you download the Shop app
and vote from one of them by buying either Nolans or Karls football
And now that I can afford this video lets see if Mack loses 700000
Hi!  Hi!
Hey Jimmy
There you go!
Welcome to the outside world
Now that you are out of the coffin lets see if you were in there
for 24 hours
If the number I reveal is lower than 24 hours then you lose 700000
I feel like Im going to throw up
36 hours!
That is what I am talking about
He scares me
Congratulations Mack
This means that you are now just one challenge away
from winning all this money
Lets go
You should probably go shower first
Yeah I smell not great
So far in this video Mack has shown me
It is very difficult to scare him
but the final challenge of this video may just be Macks worst fear ever
And thats because the final challenge of this video
is a 1 to 1 recreation of the challenge he failed on last time
The last challenge
Hold this in front of your face Dont look
Hey Im not looking  Dont look
Im not looking  All right keep your eyes closed
Dont open them
Dont open your eyes
Keep walking Dont open them
Dont open them
All right open them
No no no Im not doing that again
Come over here
No! Jimmy I do not want to do this again
Stand here where the cameras can see you
No!  Okay
The last challenge is the fear of failure
We recreated the set where he lost 800000 in this video
And like last time the rules are extremely simple
There are four stages
Each has its own cookie with a shape on it
You have to cut out all the shapes without breaking a cookie
And if you do break a cookie you lose 700000
And for you specifically
it will have been the second time its happened
This is from my nightmares man
I do not want to be here again
Well good Because I have an offer for you
You can quit right now
and walk away with this 300 grand or risk it for the biscuit
And if you finish this final challenge win 700000
This is actually like a very very big decision
Yeah because thats not quite enough is it? Its less than half
But if you lose again that is 15 million lost on this set
Are you sure?
Hes hitting it
Mac I know this is hard
but youre going to have to make a decision here
Do you want to go home with 300000
or do you want to risk it all for this final challenge?
All right fine Im doing it
All right To be honest Im glad I want you to win this whole thing
If you look at this iPad right here
this is exactly how long it took Mack to get through all four stages
last time he did the challenge 34 minutes and 54 seconds
So thats exactly how long Im going to give you again
Starting now
Dont break the cookie while opening
There you go
Even though hes going quick right now
might not be in his best interest
because if he accidentally snaps a cookie he loses
34 minutes
You did it that quick?
Scan scan scan scan
Its green
This is a much different deal than last time
So Im going to take my sweet time cutting the circle out
Lets go
He is flying through this
Why is it so much harder to open?
Probably because youre like freaking out
You want me to try?
Open it
Okay Hold my iPad
Okay Its very hard to open
What are you guys doing?
I dont want to be responsible for that
Be careful
Theoretically Macks strategy makes sense
Getting through the easier shapes fast
to save all the time for umbrella which he lost 800000 off
You literally still have 32 minutes left
Yeah Well Im going to need all 32 of those for umbrella
That is borderline impossible
Move out  Im moving
Open it
Allow me
Clap clap clap clap clap Lets go
Mack stop breaking my set
Bro you guys got to make these easier to open
Theres just no need to rush Youre literally using no time
I mean you might need to go slower on this one because its a lot trickier
This one is pretty hard not even close umbrella
Trying to get to the race before I start racing
God this is so hard
Oh my gosh
Well I dont need that anymore
Maybe it didnt break all the way through?
He still had 29 minutes left
He did the first two in 4 minutes
I dont know why I did this
Oh my God
I did that twice?
Give me your hand
No Jimmy please I dont want to leave yet
No Jimmy
Nah dude I dont even know how to feel right now
Right here Come on
I have like so much time
Yeah Im still just not sure why you were going so fast
The umbrella I just know that umbrella takes forever
Mack told me in this video that there was nothing
that I could do to scare him
And after putting him through spiders a sinking car
and more I really did start to believe him
The only thing that ended up getting to Mack
was the fear of his own failure
