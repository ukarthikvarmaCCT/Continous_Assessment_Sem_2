CONSUMER TECHNOLOGY REPORTER
JAMEY TUCKER HAS FOUND A
SOLUTION THAT HELPS PROTECT
YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS
JAMEY TUCKER REPORTING
Its important to protect your
primary email address Bad
guys can and do use email
addresses to bombard people
with malware and even steal
identies Youve heard of
burner phones those phones
used often by people who want
to hide their tracks If you
dont like giving away your
email addressyoull love
burner email Youre visiting
a website that offers a
special deal in exchange for
your information specifically
your email address Sometimes
youre okay with that but a
lot of times you dont want to
be bothered AFTER you get the
special deal Burner email is
an extension for both the
Chrome and Firefox browser
that creates a secret email
address Heres how it works
Install the burner email
extension youll find it in
the Chrome Store or as a
Firefox plugin Now when
youre asked to sign up for
something look for the flames
in the signup boxget it
burner? Click on it and the
extension will create an email
address for that specific
newsletter or site When the
company sends you one of their
emails it goes to burner
email first and gets
forwarded on to you The
company or website never gets
your primary email address
Youll get the newsletters for
as long as you want them
Getting too many you can turn
it off or if youre done with
them delete or burn it the
secret email address Using a
burner or disposable email
address will protect the one
you use for important things
