I have a challenge for all 3 of you okay?
I want you to pick any fast food location of your choice
and spent 24 hours in it without being kicked out
Good luck!
What to do?
Its from Mr Beast and not an ordinary challenge
We are in the McDonalds and I am going to be here for 24 hours
We searched for the biggest and most empty McDonalds
Its highly rated
It has two floors
It was very crowded so we sneaked to the first floor
We are now sitting in the corner
So Harsh we now have to order
And how will we pass the time?
I have thought of ordering the full menu
It will take time for us to eat and they wont rush us out
You have become as cunning as me in my company
And your son will be the most cunning
He is saying that he will eat fries
Go to the floor below and order the full menu
Its 1000 am
Go order fast Hand me your parcel
Dont take him with you
yes Keep it with you

But I am very tired and I dont know what to do
I am thinking of getting a nap right here
There is no other option
You can handle Asher?
Definitely You go to sleep
Its been evening from the morning
We are tired of watching this view
The staff is also bored of seeing us here
Asher is feeling sleepy and hungry
Its milk time for Asher
I found a baby chair
Lets give Asher milk in this chair
And here is my coffee
Where is the coffee?
See what I got?  I already saw it and thought of making him sit in that
Where?  Anywhere!

Your coffee Where is his milk?
Thats what I am making!  Wow Prerna
Its almost evening
Eat play and be happy
Its the best spot
Its all empty

To make him asleep
First Asher will sleep then I will
We will sleep and then it will soon be dark
And we will hide and thats how we will complete our challenge
They will kick us out
Lets keep ordering

It feels like heaven in the lap of Dad
I have to sleep sleep sleep
Harsh how to pass the time?
its been evening from day and I thought to touch up a little
Its more red
Harsh is still walking with Asher
Arent you tired?  Very
Thank You!  Thank You
He didnt seem happy to me
We are bothering him with orders
This is my fourth coffee
To accompany me Harsh has ordered hot chocolate
This is already my fourth coffee
I ordered only because of the cookie
Its the best chocolate
And it was a good cookie so I ordered coffee 4times
I have had four cookies
They have been pissed off a little by us
They werent coming for the coffee I ordered 30 minutes ago
They said we should take out the order by ourselves
I was eavesdropping
The kid behind us is also named Asher
You only do this dont you?
I have to pass the time  What else to do?
She gets super attentive while she is sitting somewhere
The lights are turned on outside
Its evening now
I feel sleepy
I am trying again and finally he is drinking the milk
Lets order him a hot chocolate
He is not of age
Its like a house now
He is again taking him to walk around
While exploring the M McDonalds menu
We found a goggle for Asher
Its a little big for his face
These were the only ones in the kids section
I am not interested  Try it on once
You will see double momies and daddies
He wants to eat that too
no I  am not giving it to you
Play with this
He likes McD
Just we couldnt
What happened?
He is slapping me
He wants to ride in the car
Its a challenge  He wants to go to trampoline
He wants to go with them
He got bored here
Your fries are here
Count them
Its a happy meal
He cried seeing the happy meal
Thank You!
Now I am going to tell you  whats in a happy meal
We have a Kartik Aryan burger fries coke and its a book inside the Pokemon Pikachus box
And pineapple juice
What happened? Your neck got stuck?
Lets go home
He got me upset He is slapping me
Now I am going to count how many fries  are there in small medium and large
First lets start with small
1920I wont be able to fill them back in 2122
41  Small has 41 fries
Now medium
Guess how many would be in this?
I guess 70  Dont confuse me
67 fries
I guessed 70
I was close
NOw large  First guess
Around 60 Medium is similar to large
It would be a fraud then
We will get to know soon  I am guessing 85
I feel it has the least fries
large fries are a myth
Never order large fries from now on
Medium is good enough
I will say order small
They robbed us I used to think how  many would be there in large
He comes for cleaning again and again
Thank You!
He is very helpful
Lets give him a meal
Call him over
It was good until we hadnt calculated
Its a shock  Medium and large are the same
I was getting bored so we will now do a Happy Meal challenge
We will do an epic Happy Meal challenge
This is the fastest eating challenge
Lets see who finishes the happy meal between me and Dhruv
Jump right in
Dont eat in such a bad way
Dhruv you couldnt even eat it
Come on do it one bite
Go for a single bite
I would eat fires
Look at how badly they are eating
I think he will win
My fries are finished  Finished?
So fast!
There are no tomatoes
You are behind
Come on
Dont you want to win?
Dhruv has lost
In how many bites are you gonna finish it?
3 bites
Lets ee
The end
He hasnt even finished the fries  he is way behind
No the Pepsi
Dhruv lost and harshly ate the meal in 20 seconds
The world is moving but she isnt
Because Asher is asleep and now  I have to keep sitting like this
Asher liked McD
They have got very comfortable here
We have to be here so we had to make it comfortable
They have been standing right  here for the last 15 minutes
What are you looking at?
Asher is looking at the car and trampoline
He wants to go there He is stuck here
He is saying he can do it tomorrow
Today he feels good here
We want to go there he is getting sad
We will go after the challenge
We will circle back here   No the challenge will end
It wont  It will
It wont  It will
So Harsh and Asher left
I thought of taking him on this car ride
He is enjoying it so much Should I leave Asher?
He isnt seeing me Look up your mother is doing the challenge
He isnt sitting but standing
After spending the day the evening the night in the McDonalds
Harsh and Asher got soft over a car A battery car
We got Asher to the trampoline
Asher go fetch the ball once
Come back after getting the ball
We are waiting for Prerna
When she will be content?
Otherwise we will wait here but not go up
Its the McDonalds where we are doing our challenge
Prerna is sitting up there somewhere
Do you wanna order anything last?  Last means?
Its gonna close at 11 PM  Isnt this 247?
No Its not 247  Cant I stay here?
You can stay here but you would have to do the dishes
Just give me 5 minutes to think
Is this gonna close?
Do you want to eat anything?
What? I mean I thought it was 247
It closes at 11 PM
What to do now? Should I try to hide?
Will I fit here?
Wont someone catch me here?
