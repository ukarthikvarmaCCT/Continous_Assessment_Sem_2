Hello friends!
About 100 million years ago
Earth looked completely different
With no humans some scary animals were ruling over this planet
Dinosaurs so big that they were taller than buildings
With jaws so strong that they could have crushed your bones within a second
They were so fast that they ran at around the speed of 90kmhr
They were truly feararousing creatures
They ruled over Earth for more than 170 million years
But then one day something happened
That completely wiped them off the planet
What happened exactly?
And how?
Come lets understand this in todays video
As it gets closer to the planet Earths gravitational pull gets stronger
They now cant see whats headed their way
Friends the word Dinosaur originated from Greek
From the words Denios and Sauros
Denios means Terrible And Sauros means Lizard
A terrible lizard
This is the literal meaning of the word Dinosaur
The word was used for the first time in 1841
When dinosaur fossil was discovered for the first time
Richard Owen a British scientist used the word dinosaur
Back then people did not know much about dinosaurs or their appearance
So the initial drawings of how dinosaurs might have looked
Are vastly different from what we know now
Megalosaurus was one of the first fossils to be discovered
Look at the initial drawings of it
Decades later as the researchers discovered more information about them
The drawings were modified
Trying to make them more realistic
So the depictions look like this now
Today more than 10000 dinosaur fossils
have been unearthed by palaeontologists worldwide
And more than 900 distinct have been identified
You might be excited by the prospect of discovering more fossils
But interestingly from 2003 to 2022
On average each year about 45 new species of dinosaurs have been identified
The work of palaeontologists is far from over
Look at the photos of the new species of dinosaurs discovered last year
Of them this is a bizarre dinosaur discovered in Chile
with a weapon that looks like a blade on its tail
And a beak for a mouth
It was named Stegouros Elengassen
Overall we know a lot about dinosaurs today
But come lets start this story at the beginning
Lets dive into the past
Millions of years ago
Scientists estimate that the first dinosaur
emerged about 230240 million years
Because the oldest dinosaur fossils that we have found till now
Is from 2314 million years ago in Africa
Back then Earth was much different than it is today
The continents that you see now
Asia Africa Australia Europe
All continents were joined together
There was only one supercontinent
That we call Pangaea
Scientists believe that Pangaea looked somewhat like this
You can even see the placement of the continents that we know
Then the climate of Earth was dry and arid with only a little rain
This time period has been named the Triassic Period
The era when the dinosaurs had started emerging
Dinosaurs were slowly populating the Earth due to evolution
The dinosaurs of this era arent anything like the ones you imagine
They were quite small in size
The common dinosaurs of the time
Were generally around 2 meters long only
For example Eoraptor was a dinosaur that existed in that period
In fact this dinosaur is known as the ancestor of other dinosaurs
The dominant animals of the era
Were giant reptiles
Some of these reptiles looked cute
Like this one thats believed to be the ancestor of all turtles
With time Earth started changing
201 million years ago the Triassic period ended
When Earths climate changed suddenly
The Pangaea started breaking apart
Although I am using the word suddenly
It didnt happen in a day or two
It was relatively sudden
In the time scale of millions of years
It happened gradually over thousands of years
Cracks appeared in the supercontinent
Largescale volcanic explosions took place on and around the cracks
Due to the numerous volcanic eruptions
a large amount of carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide was released into the atmosphere
This caused intense global warming
When the sulphur dioxides and aerosols entered the atmosphere
It blocked the sunlight and caused some cooling
Acidification of the oceans started
When the carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide mixed with the water
The acidity of the ocean water increased
The climate was changing rapidly
And survival became difficult for the animals that existed
Most reptiles and other species back then were coldblooded animals
They couldnt withstand the temperature changes
But the dinosaurs were warmblooded like humans
It was easier for the dinosaurs to tolerate the temperature changes
The volcanic eruptions and climate change continued for about 600000 years
Due to this almost all the other species became extinct
The only animals remaining on Earth were the dinosaurs crocodiles turtles and early mammals
This event is known as the TriassicJurassic Extinction Event
As I said after this the Triassic period ended
And the Jurassic period began
If this sounds like a familiar name
This is the inspiration for the name of the Jurassic Park films
The word Jurassic refers to this Jurassic Period
The Jurassic period lasted from 201 million ago to 145 million years ago
During this time dinosaurs emerged as the most dominant species on the planet
Due to evolution some of them became quite large in size
Like some of the earliest Titanosaurus
They lived around 160 million years ago
Each of them weighed up to 15000 kg
And could be up to 15 metres long
Some other iconic dinosaurs of the time were
During the Jurassic period some dinosaurs evolved to fly
One of the first feathered dinosaurs was Archaeopteryx
It looked somewhat like this
At this time the Pangaea supercontinent
Was divided into two
Two smaller supercontinents
We named them Laurasia and Gondwanaland
Friends due to the Jurassic Park films
The Jurassic period is the most widely known
But it was the next period when dinosaurs truly flourished
The Cretaceous period
Because at this time we saw an explosion in the diversity of dinosaurs
Several new species of dinosaurs evolved
TRex perhaps the most famous dinosaur to be shown in films
Existed in the Cretaceous period
It reached peak dominance only at the end of the Cretaceous period
Around 6568 million years ago
Though this is debated among researchers
Most scientists believe that TRex didnt exist in the Jurassic period
Its quite ironic that in the film Jurassic Park
TRex is used for their logo
The Cretaceous period was the longest time in the era of dinosaurs
Starting around 145 million years ago
It lasted til 65 million years ago
The 2 supercontinents Laurasia and Gondwanaland
Started breaking up
And the structure of the continents
Looked similar to what we see today Several flowering plants evolved at this time
Several flowering plants evolved around this time
And the average temperature of the Earth was warmer than it was in the past
Sea levels were quite high
And almost all kinds of dinosaurs that you can imagine
Existed during this period
Raptors Armored Dinosaurs
Giant herbivorous dinosaurs
Dangerous carnivorous dinosaurs
Titanosaurus one of the largest land animals
Argentinosaurus which could weigh up to 77 tonnes
And TRex that could be up to 40 feet long
Believed to be the apex predator of its time
It had the strongest and most powerful jaws compared to any other animal
A fun fact the evolution of grass
began only 70 million years ago
In the story that I have been telling you
Dont imagine a grassfilled Earth
There were other kinds of plants
TRex and Triceratops evolved 68 million years ago
Do you know what this means?
We are closer to the dinosaur TRex
Than it was to the Jurassic Period
Since theres 80 million years between the Jurassic period and the TRex evolution
But only 68 million years between us and TRex
Another interesting dinosaur that existed then
Were the Ornithomimids
They looked like ostriches
They were among the fastest dinosaurs
They could run at the speed of 80 kmhr
And in terms of flying instead of running
The largest flying dinosaur was Quetzalcoatlus
Had a wingspan of 1011 meters
As you can see this was the most prosperous period for dinosaurs
The climate was favouring them new species were evolving
And there were no other animal species to compete with them
They were simply ruling over Earth
Everything was going well
Until one day something happened that completely wiped off dinosaurs from Earth forever
A large asteroid with a diameter of roughly 1015 km
Came hurling towards Earth and crashed into it
This happened 66 million years ago
And this asteroid strike ended the Cretaceous period
The speed of the asteroid was 30 km per second
150 times faster than a jet airliner
Specifically speaking it hit the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico
The same place where millions of years later the Mayan tribe emerged
And built historical wonders like Chichen Itza
I explored the Yucatan Peninsula in my vlogs as well
You can watch the vlogs of this place if you want to
The link will be in the description
When the asteroid hit Earth
It created a large crater
With a diameter of 180 km
Due to its impact energy was released at such a speed
That could be released with 100 teratonnes of TNT 100 trillion tonne or 100000 trillion kg
If you compare this with the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
The asteroid produced 1 billion times their energy
This was such a big impact
That everything around it disintegrated in the blink of an eye
The impact threw a lot of soil into the air
The land heated up
And the hot dust rained over the other areas
The global temperatures rose by several degrees for hours
All animals within thousands of kilometres of range from here
Were cooked alive by the sheer heat
Its believed that only small animals could survive the impact of this initial blast
Because they found underground shelter
Or they hid underwater in caves or in large tree trunks
But this was only the initial impact
This was followed by shock waves heat pulses
Wildfires in the forests for thousands of kilometres
And big tsunamis
Its speculated that there would have been an immediate tsunami with a 2 km tall wave
Can you even imagine a 2 km tall tsunami wave?
Volcanic eruptions started once again
Acid rain fell and earthquakes occurred
The shortterm effects were quite deadly
But you would think that
on the other side of the Earth that wasnt hit
Animals could have perhaps survived there
But the longterm consequences were even deadlier
The dust particles in the air
Blocked sunlight for the next year all around the planet
The planet went into a nuclear winter
The temperature dropped drastically
Its estimated that for the next 3 years
The earth was at freezing temperatures
It killed many plants and animals
Since the sunlight was blocked for 1 year
It was impossible for plants to use photosynthesis
The plants died
With dying plants the herbivorous animals had nothing to eat and they died out
Even the carnivorous animals were left with nothing to eat and they too died out
A chain reaction was caused
The only animals safe of these consequences
Were small omnivorous animals
Such as mammals lizards turtles and some birds
These animals could survive because
They could survive as scavengers as well
The dead dinosaurs fungus decaying plant matter
These were the food that kept them alive
These small creatures could survive for a significant amount of time
The impact of the asteroid had destroyed carbonate rocks too
This caused carbon and sulphur to be released into the atmosphere once again
And for the next several thousand years
The sunlight was significantly reduced
That was not at the normal levels
Apart from this acid rain continued for thousands of years
When the nuclear winter ended
The dust in the atmosphere settled down
Sunlight reached the planet once again
But the problem was that a large quantity of carbon dioxide was already released into the atmosphere
This caused intense global warming
Think about this friends
One asteroid changed earths history for the next thousands of years
If we ignore a few exceptions
No 4legged creature weighing more than 25 kg
Could survive this event
All terrestrial dinosaurs went extinct
And with them the plant and animal species once thriving on Earth
More than 75 of it went extinct
Friends at this point the Cretaceous period ended
And the next era began
The Paleogene period
Friends it wasnt as if everything had ended
This event was like an opportunity for the rest of the animal species
The rulers of the planet Dinosaurs were no more
So it was an opportunity for the other animals to come up and rule
Humans should be thankful for this asteroid
Because this awarded a good opportunity for the evolution of mammals
After the extinction of dinosaurs
The gap in the food chain left by the dinosaurs
Was filled in by several mammals
It was in this period that we saw the evolution of horses whales bats and primates
Several snakes and smaller lizards started emerging in this period
The only group of dinosaurs that could survive
were the flying dinosaurs
Gradually they evolved and became the birds that we now know
Yup you read that right
The birds that you see flying around today
The flying dinosaurs are their ancestors
Most studies have confirmed that
Birds belong to the same family as dinosaurs
Specifically speaking ancestry is shared most closely by
Chickens and ostriches
This is why people might say that
The closest living relative of TRex a dangerous dinosaur
Is a chicken
You might have a question about the asteroid
How did we find out
The spot where the asteroid crashed?
And that it crashed 66 million years ago?
How did we figure out the date?
This is evidenced by a rare mineral
Scientists found that at a few places on Earth
We have a high concentration of iridium on the ground
But when the geologists analysed Earth
they found that it is a very rare mineral on Earth
Despite that it is so abundant on our ground
How could this be?
This could happen because comets and asteroids
Have a high concentration of iridium
And when scientists put the iridium into carbon dating
They found that the iridium layer that we find
Is 66 million years old
This could happen only when the asteroid hit the planet
And in the pursuing blast this mineral spread all around
You might also wonder that since the asteroid had an impact this big
We should be able to see the crater it left on Earth
Well you are not wrong
But an event that occurred so long ago 66 million years ago
Might not look like youd imagine it to be
Because since then the continents have been relentlessly shifting
The crater of this asteroid is hidden in the Yucatan Peninsula
But several digging expeditions were conducted
That proved that it had actually happened
And the exact location it happened
If you look at the map this is the exact location
Half of it is submerged under the sea
And the other half is on land
A realworld impact that we can still see
Are the cenotes in this Mexican area
These beautiful sinkholes show a pattern
The crater formed by the asteroid
The cenotes can be found in a ring formation around the crater
Nowadays they are famous tourist attractions
You can go swimming in these cenotes
And overall these cenotes form the worlds largest underground cave system
After hearing this astounding story of this asteroid strike
You might be thinking about what would happen
If such an asteroid comes and hits the planet now?
Will humans go extinct?
This is definitely a threat
The asteroids that might hit Earth in the foreseeable future
Are known as Near Earth Asteroids
NASA and other space agencies are
continuously tracking all nearearth asteroids
To compute their path and if and when they will collide with Earth
As of April 2022 more than 28000 near earth asteroids have been identified
Of which more than 800 have a diameter of 1 km or more
This is a scary number
So many asteroids that may potentially collide with Earth
But today you dont need to be scared about this
Because scientific calculations are so advanced that
We can clearly predict their path
And can calculate the exact location of the impact
We can even estimate the chances of it actually colliding with Earth
And if they are indeed on a path of collision
What can we do to stop it?
This was the idea behind NASAs DART space mission launched in 2021
Double Asteroid Redirection Test
They planned to have a spacecraft collide with an asteroid
So that the path of the asteroid can be altered
And if in future theres an asteroid about to collide with Earth
We can alter its path
This might sound like science fiction
But this idea was already successful
In September 2022 a test was launched
On an asteroid that was not on the path towards Earth
NASA sent a spacecraft to it
The spacecraft collided with the asteroid and its path was altered
If they could successfully do it to that asteroid
It can be done to any asteroid on the way to Earth in future
But that doesnt mean that theres no danger at all
Humans are the danger here
The asteroid strike that killed the dinosaurs Is known as the 5th extinction event in Earths history
After this scientists believe that the 6th extinction event
Has already begun
This isnt due to any volcano or asteroid
It is caused by humans
This is named the Holocene Extinction Event
Over the last 100200 years
We have seen the loss of biodiversity at an unprecedented scale
Animals and plant species are rapidly going extinct due to humans
Biologists agree that it is a mass extinction
Deforestation by humans
Pollution in oceans and atmosphere
Due to this the normal rate is more than 1001000 times more than the current rate of extinction
Habitats of the animals that exist now
Are being destroyed
Thousands of mammals birds reptiles and amphibians
Are now in the endangered category
Or have already gone extinct due to humans
To stop this destruction
a United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity Meeting was held in Japan in 2010
20 biodiversity targets were set
To be achieved by 2020
Unfortunately only 6 of those have been partially achieved
In January 2020 a new Parisstyle plan was  set
to prevent biodiversity and ecosystem collapse
The deadline was set as 2030
Its purpose is to ensure that 30
of the land and oceans are given the status of being protected
To reduce pollution by at least 50
Scientists have proposed that the extinctions taking place
Need to be limited to 20 per year or fewer
Well have to see how many targets can be met
But one thing is certain that
it is important to do these
Because if plants and animals species go extinct now
In the same way it happened in the previous extinction events
Perhaps it wouldnt be possible for humans to survive
Its interesting to note that
As per calculations humans originated
merely 300000 years ago in Africa
As per the data
Compared to the dinosaurs
Who were the dominant species on Earth for 174 million years
Weve been here for only 300000 years
While they lived for 174 million years
600 times longer than humans
What do you think?
Can humans beat the record set by dinosaurs?
Or will humans go extinct before theyre 1 million years old?
Comment below with your opinion
Obviously the right answer will depend on
Our collective efforts to save this planet
