These tanks are literally about to rain missiles on this 500000
And any money that doesnt get destroyed Im giving to Blake
But lucky for you Im going to give you my credit card
And you can spend as much money
as you want
trying to protect this money from all of the missiles
were going to be firing at your money
So I just build whatever I want?  Whatever you want
But you only have 24 hours before we fire the tanks
I need metal! Lets go!
Alright lets go boys! Hes running!
Were kicking this off with a sprint
All right Blake where are we heading to first?
Im thinking the Junkyard  Blakes first 3 hours
consisted of sourcing any metal he could find to protect his money
I mean this looks like they have metal even if that meant spending 30000
Definitely want that Want that All the trucks
Basically you just want every car here  Yeah
Can you give me any of your shipping containers?
Lets go out back!
Yeah This is good
Those would work well if I put them on top of the money
And is if buying out the entire store wasnt enough
Blake did the same thing at two other industrial stores
Well everything I get from you today
I would need within the next 12 hours
12 hours?
Im willing to pay double  Ok well get it
It is very quick to throw my money around
And while we waited for the materials to be delivered
We headed back to the money and Blake laid out his official plan
You just spent the last hour strategizing
What did you come up with to stop the tanks
from destroying your money?
Step one I want to put a shipping container over the money
That is actually genius
Step two giant water tanks
Do you think thats your best defense?
I think its good but its not the best
Step three these containers filled with bricks
hay and wood
Step four is my best defense
A fortress of strategically angled cars from the last video that I saw
Those bullets are going to hit those cars and ricochet elsewhere
If he actually builts everything you see here
I will be flabbergasted
Lets get to work  Good luck
Unfortunately for Blake
it wouldnt be for another 4 hours until his materials were delivered
So he hired some construction workers to help get the job done
Im building a complete fortress
If we dropped the atomic bomb on this thing
the moneys not going anywhere
This is like an industrial construction site
It started to look like Blake
might actually have a chance at protecting his money
But even if the 500 grand survives those tanks the tanks
are actually only the first of four phases of attacks
Blake will have to defend
And believe me when I say this theyre going to get much more challenging
For the rest of the night
Blake and his crew worked tirelessly to defend the money
but by the time the sun rose they still werent quite done
Looking good Looking good
Thats the money The tanks are over there
What is this car here for?
This is like my inventory back here dude
Put your inventory between the money and the tank
Give me 10 minutes And that white car will be ready
I mean you have 5 minutes
I dont think I even have time to do anything else
Time is up Stop stop time is up
Drop it Drop it right there
Go far away
Blake time is officially ended
Seems pretty sturdy
Lets go fire some tanks
Ive been up for about 25 hours now
Just building and building and building
I mean Im looking at it now and it looks great
But then I turn around and I see these five beasts
and then I see these shells that theyre working with
I really had no idea theyre going to be that big
You think a shipping container is stopping that?
Hopefully three of them are
Oh man
All right its time Load up the tanks
All right
These five tanks aimed at your money are about to fire 20 rounds
Blake fire the first shot
Theres so much dust
Oh my Gosh! Look at his face Look at Blakes face
No way his money is safe
So only 19 more right?
19 more to go
Chandler Fire!
This is way too much fun
Oh my God
All the way back here
I can count eight holes in that shipping container
Yeah I see those holes
No shot his money is safe  Id ask you how youre feeling
Well we might as well fire the last few shots
Lets just get this over with
Five shots
Four shots remain
Three shots remain
How much money do you have back there?
Like half a
Two remain
And of course Blake you have to fire the last shell
The honor is mine
After this well see if you have any money left
Lets go
Oh hes running Hes so fast
Is there any money?
Wait its still there!
Blake it looked like your money survived
We got a fresh stack
I know youre happy
Were moving on to phase two of four and in 24 hours were going to blow up
the biggest bomb weve ever blown up in our history of the channel
around this money
Are you going to drop it or are you going to shoot it?
Im glad you asked Ill be right back
Blake what do you think is in those green crates?
I dont know dude it looks like
Here Ill answer for you
This is a hundred crates filled to the brim with TNT
How are you even allowed to do that?
Im not sure its legal
And while we prepared one of the biggest explosions
in YouTube history
Blake began to strategize on how to keep his money safe
Step one we got to take everything flammable out of here man
All the wood has got to go
Step two water tanks
Step three
I want to move the shipping containers that I got
I just want to close them in into the other shipping containers
Then step four is just walls cement bricks cars if I have to
Explosion is a lot worse than the tanks
This is bigger than that safe that blew up?
Every single thing inside that destroyed
The first time he lost 250000 in this video
Are we going to repeat it?
And because at this point Blake had been awake for over 24 hours
he trusted the construction workers
to finish the job while he got a good nights rest
Yeah Im going to bed Good night guys This is Blake going dark
And because he was so exhausted
Blake slept for way longer than he planned
All right I got a good nights sleep
About to find out how much progress was really done overnight
Like half
That means nothing has happened since Ive been gone
And with only 6 hours remaining Blake did what he could by covering
his weak spots with spare parts bricks and more cars
Looking good in here looking real good
Oh Mr Jimmy  What am I about to witness?
If you listen closely you can hear beeping
Its actually a school bus coming in
Its going to be plopped right where youre standing
I assume its not full of children
Its a short bus
That is just not what I asked
Is our brand new feastable bar new flavor new branding
You want to try it Blake?  Yeah
Im using our snack products
to distract them from telling them where to put the bus
Dude honestly this is better than all the other ones
All the other ones  I promise
Anyone want a piece of chocolate?
Did you get that?
Hey Blake!
5 minutes till boom
I need 10 more minutes Just give me five extra minutes
You have four minutes
Bro you spraying them with water  Probably feels good
I dont think they agree
Theyre literally getting off the car
Theyve got 90 seconds left
Blake youre running out of time
Go! Go!
Come on
Come on
Hey! Its five oclock
Stop stop stop turn it off turn it off
Hey hey Blake Turn it off
before I start taking your money
Lets go over to the bunker
You narrowly escaped death from the tanks
Lets see if you can do it again
Let the sun go down so its a little darker now
This is the biggest bomb weve ever set off
This is the first bomb Ive ever seen
Blake are you nervous?
Yeah Im sweating now
This is the detonation device Here you go
Its live?
Yes its live
Two days of work 17 cars six water jugs
for shipping containers and 500000 on the line
Lets find out if youre going to be rich or go home with nothing
When youre ready Blake
two one
Mom I love you
Oh my gosh
That firestorm is massive
Can we go put that out?  Before we go put it out
Im just wasting time
Grab the fire extinguisher!
Go go go go
Lets go see if it burns!
Oh no
Oh its on fire over there
Oh no
Be careful of this
Get off my money
The fire still going on up front
Blake is moving sandbags
Right there should be good
Please dont be ashes
Please dont be ashes
What do you see? What do you see?
I see green!  Oh my gosh
Yeah baby! Yeah!
I see a lot of dirt on it but it seems it survived
I knew it
Blake youve officially completed phase two of four
Do you want to see what the next challenge is?
All right Blake for your third challenge
were going to be dropping flaming cars filled with gasoline
on top of your money
Can you tell me how many cars?
A lot  A lot?
A lot
This is going to be the hardest phase yet
Not only will Blake have to deflect the attack from the sky
but hell also have to protect his money from the flammable gasoline
seeping through the cracks of his defense
And after we drop the cars I have another surprise
Good luck
I want the crate with the money in it to be stuffed with concrete
that shipping container thats just sitting
Plop that on top of the money
Since Blake had been working
so hard for the past few days he ended up going right to sleep
and saved most of his work the next day
And although he seemed confident this challenge
would soon prove itself to be more difficult
than anything hes ever faced in these videos
Lets go Blake!  Come on Blake!
Alright this is day four
Im feeling like a zombie
Were going to take the other shipping container that I have
Were going to pick that up and were going to put it
in a formation to where the point is facing up so its like a pyramid
The cars will hit it doom and fall but not on the money
Weve got to get that shipping container on top as soon as possible
Its starting to worry me a little bit
Over the next few hours
Blake did everything in his power
to place the top shipping container at an angle to deflect the cars
even if that meant using wooden logs to prop it up
If this container does not go exactly where I want to right now
Im probably losing a lot of money
We did it
Oh that makes me feel really good
The water tank we bring that over to
like right here fill that thing with bricks
and then were going to take the last car we got
Put it right here
Thats going to block all this is going to look great
We got a plan baby
But what Blake didnt know is I was about to introduce a twist
Do you want to know what the twist is?
Yeah  Follow me
See that flag over there? Thats a catapult
So as cars fall from the top giant flaming balls
are going to be hurled from the side
Dude Ive been guessing millions of things I never thought catapult
I have like no more materials I have nothing else to use
Throughout the final hour Blake raced to cover the weak spots
of his fortress
However there was still a key part missing
His water truck
which he sent to refill in the morning was painfully late
He has 90 seconds left
Alright here we go
As always it comes down to the wire with Blake
60 59 58
54 Hes drenching everything in water
before he drop the car to try to protect the money from the fire
30 seconds remain
You really think this is going to stop the fire?
Oh yeah baby
Three two one Drop it
Just for that
Im not showing mercy on the last one
You knew that was going to happen dude  That was intentional
Oh man moment of truth
Look how high up that bad boy is
This is only the first of five flaming cars
Were going to be dropping
On top of the five flaming death balls from the catapult
You ready? Blake?  Get this going dude
Light it on fire!
Now drop it
Oh no
Oh my Gosh!
Hold on
Everything is actually setting on fire right now
The burning car successfully rolled off the container
However the wood that Blake used to prop it up
quickly engulfed in flames
Dude whats going on?
What is happening?
What in there is on fire Blake?
I dont
I dont even know what to say
What was on top of the shipping container?
All right there is wood there
Lets not jinx it
Knock on wood
You put wood?
And you knew we are dropping flaming cars?
I needed to use them dude
Luckily Blake
did surround his money with cinderblocks
so theres still a very high likelihood his money is unburned
And since were about to go into the coolest part of this video
obviously now Im going to tell you about ACORNS
Their debit card is meant to help
you grow your money not just spend it
which Ill tell you more about in a second fire!
ACORNS just launched the new Mighty Oak debit card
They made with Dwayne Johnson
Cool thing about this debit card is every time
you make a purchase
it automatically rounds up
to the nearest dollar and invest the difference for you
Believe it or not your money is also under attack not by flaming
death balls but by things like bills spending and inflation
Which is why when youre not spending
your money youll be hard at work
in two of the highest APYs available
Chandler what does APYs mean?
It means you can fight back against bills and inflation
by growing your money  just by having it in your account
Blake how are you doing buddy?
Im remembering what it feels like to lose one of these things
Oh its a direct hit
Right on the money
Just from signing up ACORNS and I are giving you 20
to start growing your money
So go to acornscommrbeast
To learn about how you can make your money work for you
Light it on fire!
Drop it
The rain of fire continued all throughout the night
Oh oh
And as the flames only grew bigger things started to look really
bleak for Blakes money
No no no
That fire was raging for over an hour and a half
Its either all going to be there or its not going to be there at all
That right there is a bunch of logs of wood
He accidentally created a giant bonfire
He thought he was making a fortress
but he was actually making a furnace
I mean theres still a chance the concrete protected the money
Blake moment of truth Did your cinderblocks
protect your money or was the fire just too much?
Oh my God
Oh no
Oh Oh
Those are ruined
Wait hold up The money is fried
Its a thousand degrees in there
Lets be real with ourselves Blake
Its gone
As you saw most of the money looks like this
Another loss
Yeah This one hurts more than the laser one
What hurts the most is that I worked so hard for nothing
Yeah it sucks
The challenge is officially over
And before you go Blake I have an offer for you
You have two choices
You can either walk away with 100000 or you could get a third
and final chance to compete in a future video
All right Im coming back  Youre coming back?
Im coming back
Blakes last chance to win
a video is going to be right here but it wont be out until February
I dont think me the audience
Everyone can bear to see you lose a third time
Ill see you then
