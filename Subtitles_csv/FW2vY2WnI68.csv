Hello friends!
After 2011 its time for India  to host the Cricket World Cup again
And I hope that we win again  just like we did last year
Because till now the Indian  cricket team has been in great form
India has been dominating the World Cup with a series of impressive victories
leaving no other team in serious contention
In this World Cup the Indian  cricket team broke several records
In the match against Sri Lanka the team  achieved the historic victory in World Cup history
bowling out the opposition with just 55 runs
And winning with a massive 302run lead
Mohammad Shammi set the record for  the most 5wicket hauls in World Cups
and becoming Indias most  successful bowler in World Cup history
with 45 wickets in just 14 matches
The previous record was held by Zahir Khan with 44 wickets in 23 matches
In the recent semifinal match  he went on to break more records
His standout performance included 7 wickets and 57 runs
marking the best individual performance  by an Indian in ODI cricket history
Additionally he became the fastest bowler
to reach a 50wicket haul in just 17 innings
On the batting front our top star batsmen Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli
accumulated nearly 1300 runs together
Rohit Sharma scored a century
while Kohli scored 3
Virat Kohli broke many records too
He has now surpassed 50 ODI centuries
The only batsman in history to beat this record
The previous record was held by  Sachin Tendulkar at 49 ODI centuries
Additionally he broke another record held by Sachin
Most runs made by any batsman in a World Cup
In the 2003 World Cup Sachin Tendulkar set the record at 673 runs
And Kohli has already scored 711 runs in this World Cup edition
Beyond India the World Cup has seen other interesting records
including two highest runscoring matches in this World Cup
The first in the Sri Lanka v South Africa game
With a total of 754 runs
And the Australia v New Zealand game
with 771 runs
And the historic match between Australia and Afghanistan
In which Glenn Maxwell broke multiple records
Scoring 201 runs on 128 balls not out
becoming the first nonopening batsman
to achieve a double century
His partnership with the captain of the Australian team
became the highest 8th wicket partnership
in the history of ODI cricket
Australia had nearly lost the game
at one point they were playing at 917
Glenn Maxwell singlehandedly delivered Australia from their precarious score
and had the team qualify for the World Cup semifinals
Even though Afghanistan lost the match they had almost won
Afghanistans story stands out as  one of the most intriguing in this World Cup
defeating three former World Cupwinning teams
England Pakistan and Sri Lanka
Despite this being only the third time
that Afghanistan was participating in the World Cup
And the previous two times that Afghanistan had played
They had won only a single match in both World Cups combined
That was against Scotland in 2015
How could Afghanistans team accomplish this out of nowhere?
What is the reason behind the increasing popularity of cricket in Afghanistan?
What is the link between geopolitics and cricket?
Come lets discuss some unheard stories in this video
Today cricket is the second most popular sport after football
with an estimated 25 billion followers
While around 35 billion people are football fans
This number is significant  not merely due to Indias large population
as the cricket fan base is nearly double that of the Indian population
and not every Indian is a cricket enthusiast
The roots of crickets popularity can  be traced back to the British Empire
International cricket has been governed by the International Cricket Council ICC
since its establishment in 1909
Presently 12 countries are full members of the ICC
The 12 full ICC members are England Australia
South Africa West Indies New Zealand
India Pakistan Sri Lanka
Zimbabwe Bangladesh Ireland and Afghanistan
These countries share a history of colonization by the British
contributing to the widespread popularity of cricket in these nations
Afghanistan stands out as an exception to some extent
a topic we will delve into later in the video
The 12 full members of the ICC
are the exclusive participants in Test cricket
and the 10 teams participating in the ongoing World Cup
are from these 12
excluding Netherlands
Unfortunately West Indies Zimbabwe and Ireland
failed to qualify for this years World Cup
with Netherlands securing a spot instead
The Netherlands is an associate member of the ICC
The category of associate members is a tier below full membership
There are a total of 94 associate member countries in the ICC
The question arises how did cricket gain popularity in the Netherlands
a country untouched by British colonisation?
The Netherlands is a European country
There are two major reasons for this
First the proximity to England
with the British introducing cricket to the Netherlands in the early days
The British citizens who had moved to the Netherlands
And then the elite Dutch people  those from the upper class
among them crickets popularity grew
The second reason is that the Netherlands  had colonised some Caribbean countries
such as Suriname
when immigrants from those regions moved to the Netherlands postWorld War II
further fueled crickets popularity there
However its essential to note that
games like football and field hockey  are more popular than cricket in the Netherlands
Although their team did qualify for the World Cup
but cricket is not very popular in the Netherlands
Shifting our focus to India 1721 was the year
when the first recorded cricket match took place
This match was played by sailors of the  East India Company in Khambath Gujarat
Cricket reached Australia by the late 1700s
while New Zealand and South Africa saw its advent
only during the early 1800s
Ironically while England propagated cricket to so many countries
many colonized nations
won the Cricket World Cup before England
With the West Indies securing the title  in the first cricket World Cup held in 1975
and also in 1979
And it was in the third World Cup  that India claimed its victory in 1983
Countries like Australia Pakistan and Sri Lanka  have won the World Cup at least once
But it was only in 2019
that England won the World Cup trophy for the first time

And now lets get back to our topic
The memorable 2019 Cricket World Cup final match
most cricket fans would still remember this
it was so thrilling
And Englands win in the Super Over
was quite controversial
Because technically even the Super Over culminated in a tie
In this match between England and New Zealand
both teams had scored 15 runs in the Super Over
According to the rules since the Super Over was a tie
the team that scored more boundaries in the match
was declared the winner of the match
And in this years World Cup England was the fourthworst team
England could win only 3 out of the 9 matches it played
Afghanistans cricket team ranked  higher than England boasting four wins
This is the intriguing story of the Afghanistan cricket team
Some years ago in 2007
when India won the T20 Cricket World Cup
the ICC classified Afghanistan in the lowest division
Division 5
This was the worst division of ICCs associate members
However the tide turned for Afghanistan with  the rising popularity of T20 cricket that year
In September 2007 after India won the first T20 World Cup
the next month the Asian Cricket Council organized its T20 Cup
featuring 10 Asian associate teams
Hong Kong Kuwait Malaysia
Nepal Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia
Singapore the UAE and Afghanistan
Afghanistan won three out of four groupstage games
defeated the UAE in the semifinals
and played the finals against Oman
In the final match both teams tied
Oman and Afghanistan shared the trophy
For the Afghan people this trophy meant a lot
This marked the first victory of the  Afghanistan cricket team in any tournament
This marked a turning point for Afghanistan
In 2008 they secured victory in the ICC World Cricket League
this was the Division 5 league
followed by triumphs in the Division 4 league in 2008
and the Division 3 league in 2009
In just six years
they qualified for their first World Cup in 2015
The journey however was arduous for the Afghanis
As I mentioned before Afghanistan is the  only exception among Britishcolonized countries
Some parts of Afghanistan were colonized by the British
during a certain period in time
but the British could not occupy the entire country
Cricket wasnt historically popular in Afghanistan
In December 1979 when the Soviet Union invaded the country
thousands of Afghanis fled towards Pakistan
It was in the refugee camps at Peshawar
that these Afghani boys encountered cricket
The people in the refugee camps saw the Pakistanis playing cricket
And they started playing too
Initially using sticks as bats
and since they had no balls
they would roll the plastic bags as balls
Some years later in 1992
Pakistan won the World Cup for the first time under the leadership of Imran Khan
This victory was an inspiration for these Afghan refugees
This is why in 2015 when Afghanistan played its first World Cup
many of the team members were from those refugee camps
Including the 2015 opening batsman Karim Sadiq
who spent his childhood in Pakistans Kacha Kara camp
There he worked in a factory at night
and played cricket in the mornings
The Afghanistan cricket team in the 2023 World Cup
can be considered the secondgeneration players
11 of the 15 players are younger than 25 years
The assistant coach Raees Ahmadzai
is a former player
recounting how he learned to play cricket as a refugee
He emphasizes that this new generation  of the Afghanistan cricket team
is the product of their training in Afghanistan
After the Soviets rule in Afghanistan ended
Taliban rose to power
This had a major impact on their cricket
Basically one can say that cricket could flourish in Afghanistan
because Taliban didnt interfere in this sport
When Taliban established their control in 1994
they banned all sports
Except cricket
Cricket was acceptable to the Taliban because
it was a noncontact sport
There was no contact between the players
and the players didnt wear shorts like they do in football
However the situation has drastically  changed during the ensuing 30 years
The national flag that is represented by Afghanistans team
and the national anthem they sing before each match
neither of them holds official status
After the 2021 Taliban take over in Afghanistan
they introduced a new national flag
this white flag
After their resurgence the conditions have only worsened
with 90 of the Afghan population living in poverty
the financial conditions are terrible
on top of it in the past 20 months
10 major earthquakes have hit Afghanistan
Thousands of people have been displaced or have lost their lives
And the most extreme earthquake hit last month on 7th October
The death toll from an earthquake in Western Afghanistan
has risen to around 320  with 1000 more injured
This is why the biggest cricket star in Afghanistan Rashid Khan
donated his entire tournament fees from  this World Cup to the earthquake victims
He says that people pray for them back home
They watch their matches hoping that they will win
Because cricket is now the only source of joy in Afghanistan
The restrictions Taliban has placed on women
and the atrocities committed by them
hardly any place on Earth is as restrictive as it is
Women are confined to their homes
and prohibited from working or studying
Thankfully Afghanistans mens cricket team has the opportunity
to participate in the World Cup
However the womens cricket team
is now refugees in Australia
they are still struggling in their pursuit of playing opportunities
Last year Rashid Khan expressed solidarity with  the daughters and sisters of Afghanistan
advocating for the reversal of the decision  to ban girls from high schools and universities
Every day of education wasted
is a day wasted from the future of the country
For Afghani cricketers cricket is not merely a sport
This is a means to fight the circumstances
Sometimes against the Soviet invasion sometimes against Talibans oppressions
The Afghani players do not hesitate to express their opinions
Last month after defeating Pakistan
the team celebrated the victory
Afghan Captain Hasmatullah Shahidi
dedicated the victory to Afghan refugees
particularly those escaping Taliban  rule and seeking refuge in Pakistan
Whom Pakistan is forcefully sending back to Afghanistan
Islamabad has ordered all undocumented immigrants
which includes around 17 million Afghan nationals
to leave the country
The game of cricket emerges as  a potential avenue for diplomatic relations
When Afghanistan attained full membership in the ICC
their inaugural test match was against India in Bangalore
The Afghanistani President Ashraf Ghani was invited to India
to watch this first test match
Similarly during the 2011 World Cup
Dr Manmohan Singh extended an invitation to  then Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani
to watch the India v Pakistan match
aiming to ease tensions between the two countries
A similar initiative occurred in 2004 when
the Indian cricket team visited Pakistan
leading both nations to relax visa regulations
allowing the public to attend matches in these countries
These instances underscore the profound impact of crickets popularity
in fostering positive relations globally
Consequently there is a need to promote this sport in other countries
encouraging both small and large  nations to take an interest in cricket
Unfortunately the current state of the sport
reveals a concentration of control in  the hands of only three major countries
with India holding the strongest influence
While the ICC theoretically comprises 12 full members
and 94 associate countries
this is just the theoritical model
The practical reality is that ICC
is controlled by the BCCI England and Wales Cricket Board ECB and Cricket Australia CA
These three nations are often referred to as the Big Three
The consolidation of power escalated after February 2014 when
the ICC implemented structural and financial reforms
granting India England and Australia nearly
complete control over crickets governance
This power shift extended to the Big Three controlling the flow of money
Out of ICCs total projected gross revenue of 25 billion
the BCCI received a significant share of 570 million or 228
England and Australia obtained 143 million and 132 million
constituting 57 and 52 shares respectively
This distribution left associate members with minimal financial support
The Big Three argued that the funds invested in  cricket development in associate countries
did not yield satisfactory returns
prompting a reduction in financial support
Fortunately in 2017 this model was repealed
and a new model was introduced
When the voting took place for the new model
13 votes were in favour and only one vote dissented
this dissenting vote was cast by the BCCI
Because under this new model
BCCIs share would be reduced from 570 million to 293 million
A share cut from 22 to 11
Concurrently associate countries were
allocated 280 million
to stimulate growth in cricket in regions where
the sport isnt very popular yet
Regrettably this model endured for only six years
This year another model was passed
granting BCCI complete financial control over international cricket
In July the ICC approved a new revenue system
where full members will receive an 888 share of revenue
between 2024 and 2027
Over the next three years ICCs earnings are expected to be
around 600 million annually
with BCCI receiving 230 million
Around 385
The associate teams would receive 11 combined
And the other full members
would get a share in the single digits
The rationale behind this new revenue system is
the same as the one in 2014
that BCCI significantly contributes commercially to cricket
Given that most advertisers and the IPL are Indiacentric
85 of commercial weightage is attributed to BCCI
This signifies that BCCIs contribution to the  cricket economy ranges from 70 to 80
Notably the biggest contributor to this cricket economy is the IPL
commonly referred to as the Cash Cow
I have separate videos on IPL and  T20 cricket you can watch them too
If you want to understand the business model of T20 model
In that video I explained how the World Cup works
In the midst of these there is positive news about crickets popularity
it will soon be included in the Olympics
This development is expected to introduce the sport to new audiences
Curiously crickets absence from the Olympics until now
can also be attributed to the BCCIs resistance
One might wonder why the BCCI opposed taking cricket to the Olympics
given that it would enhance Indias chances of winning another gold medal
The BCCIs objection has consistently centered around the fear
of losing member autonomy
in the face of the International Olympic Committee
Essentially a concern that their control over the ICC would be diluted
With the inclusion of the International Olympic Committee in the equation
Deciding match schedules and redistribution of financial costs
would no longer be within BCCIs purview
once cricket would be played in the Olympics
In the 2007 cricket World Cup
16 teams had participated
The was reduced to 14 in 2011
and further dwindled to 10 teams in 2019
Do you know why?
As fewer teams mean more matches for India
translating into increased revenue for the BCCI
Not only the BCCI the England  Cricket Board ECB supported this too
The ECB articulated concerns that if cricket  matches are held for 225 weeks in the Olympics
fewer matches would be played in England
resulting in revenue loss
However cricket has been played at the Olympics once
123 years ago
in the 1900 Paris Olympics
where only two cricket teams participated
and only one match was played
Between Great Britain and France
After this during the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur
a full ODI tournament was included
It had 16 participating teams
culminated in South Africa winning the gold medal in this tournament
Australia was in the second spot
with the silver medal
when the Australian cricket team captain Steve Waugh had said that
winning that silver medal was the highlight of his career
even though Steve Waugh had been a part of the World Cup winning team in 1987
After this in 2008 during the Beijing Olympics
he had said that if cricket is to be globalised
it would mean including countries like China and the USA
And to include them the Olympics is the fasttrack way
Australian legendary cricketer Adam Gilchrist echoed these sentiments in 2009
asserting that making cricket an Olympic sport
would encourage many countries to take the sport seriously
and play it for the first time in their history
However no one considered these appeals seriously for so long
And cricket was kept away from the Olympics
But now thankfully it is changing
In the upcoming Los Angeles Olympics in 2028
T20 cricket will finally make its Olympic debut
This significant decision is influenced by  the growing popularity of cricket in America
With the T20 World Cup scheduled to  be hosted by the United States next year
By the time cricket makes its Olympic debut
Virat Kohli will likely be 40 years old
The prospect of witnessing whether  the greatest Indian cricket right now
can secure an Olympic gold for us or not
