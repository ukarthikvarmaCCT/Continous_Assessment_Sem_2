A whole days work and then just ruined instantly
Yeah that was still epic
You know what?
I still give it a nine outta 10 for epic
I was gonna say eight
Now were gonna drop another car

Thats a dam as in the thing that holds back water?
Oh I was gonna say
Not the bad word
If I see a yellow single on this video I will sue
Im so intrigued for whats gonna happen
Imagine he just fell off the
I was thinking the same thing cause he put a lot
of effort into that
He was willing to go all in
Imagine he falls off with it but then he
hes riding the top of it
and he bounces up and somehow survives
He bounces all the way back
up to the dam and he is like all right lets do it again
Or just bounces up and down until it stops bouncing
Hes just like all right
I love watching it
Just like
it cant really do that much
Oh no it didnt speed
Oh no it didnt speed
I love hearing Australian people talk
Okay That angle is way
Thats funny
All right now were 1500 feet in the air

Oh its MythBusters
Ladies and gentlemen this is a Mythbusters control
All right so what are we myth busting?
What happens if you fall out of a helicopter?
I think we already knew
He said it was a control though
Maybe this is just to see like the speed of how fast
a human drops
Oh he hit
He hit hard
I think its time to say it
Say it
Mannequins take a lot of flack
They do things that we dont wanna do as humans
Yeah thats true
And I think its time someone stands up for them
It better not be you because theres a shipping
container with a thousand mannequins jammed in it right now
Youre right
I do own a lot of mannequins
You know what?
Im no better than the rest of you
Now were gonna drop a Nokia from the sky

I do think its gonna break
If this still works?
What if it breaks the ground?
Where is it?
What if just goes through Earth?
Did they lose?
Whoa my theyre all laughing
But anyone could have been just destroyed by that
Decked in the head
