Hello friends!
On the morning of November 12 2023
while we were preparing for Diwali
in a tunnel in Uttarkashi
41 workers were working
on building a highway project
Around 530 in the morning
this tunnel collapsed suddenly
The workers were trapped in the tunnel
With no way out
The collapsed wall of stones and mud  standing between them and their way out
was 60 meters long
Soon a concerned group of people  gathered in this small city in Uttarakhand
The next day on November 13th
the rescue mission began officially
involving over 200 individuals
It took 17 days of intensive efforts to  successfully extricate the trapped workers
How did they achieve this feat?
Lets understand the entire rescue operation  in todays video with 3D animations
Furthermore lets answer the biggest question
What is the underlying cause of the incident?
The root cause is the same that is faced by Joshimath
a situation often overlooked  by mainstream news channels
Lets begin
The incident unfolded in Uttarkashi district in Uttarakhand
specifically in the BarkotSilkyara tunnel
this map shows its location
This is a twolane bidirectional tunnel
being constructed as a part of the Modi  Governments 120 billion Char Dham project
Lets talk about the details of the project later in the video
but broadly speaking
this is a highway project connecting 4 North Indian Dhams
Badrinath Kedarnath  Yamunotri and Gangotri
Roads will be built connecting these four dhams
to reduce the travelling distance between them
PM Modi laid the foundation stone  of this project in December 2016
This particular tunnel was announced in February 2018
under the BrahmakhalYamunotri National Highway section
The purpose of this tunnel was to reduce  the distance between Gangotri and Yamnotri
by approximately 20 km and  45 minutes of travel time
The estimated cost of the project is 1383 billion
overseen by Navyug Engineering Company Limited
under the guidance of
the National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited
From the Silkyara side 2340 meters  of construction was nearly over
And from Barkot 1600 meters was constructed
The collapsed tunnel section was situated  270 meters from the Silkyara entrance
the debris from the collapse formed a 60 meters thick wall
Fortunately since 2000 meters of the tunnel was already constructed
the trapped labourers
had a space of 2000 meters to stretch their legs
Fortunately they werent trapped in a small space
The height of the enclosure they were trapped in was 85 meters
Typically incidents of this nature are
classified as Act of God
signifying that it was a natural disaster
However the degree to which these events are  influenced by natural and human factors
is a subject of ongoing discussion
As per the governments press release
the workers were engaged in reprofiling work
a process involving adjustments to the tunnel structure
This activity becomes necessary when
the surrounding rocks exhibit unexpected  behaviours that went unnoticed previously
The exact cause of the collapse will  remains unknown until further research
However preliminary findings suggest
this collapse was due to a potential geological fault
known as the Shear Zone
This refers to a thinner or weaker part of the Earths crust
The construction would have put  a strain on the surrounding rocks
leading to a landslide
Another consideration as stated by  ML Sharma a professor from IIT Roorkee
is the presence of undetected cavities in the rocks
gaps between these mountain rocks
These cavities naturally weaken such areas
increasing the risk of landslides
These are 2 possible causes
but we can only speculate right now
and the definitive reason will be established  only after the completion of investigation reports
There are two main approaches to constructing  a tunnel construction in mountainous terrain
the first is the drill and blast method DBM
and the second is by using a tunnel boring machine TBM
The former involves drilling holes in stones
placing explosives
and literally blasting the rocks
Its as if a small bomb is detonated from inside the rocks
It is the simple and traditional approach
Using the tunnel boring machine is a more expensive
but safer alternative
The machine creates a hole in the rocks with a rotating head
and precast concrete segments are then installed
Unfortunately in the Himalayan mountains  we cannot use these machines
Due to the extreme geological conditions
As you have studied in school
the Himalayas are the youngest mountain ranges in the world
At only 4050 million years old
they continue to grow
resulting in highly sensitive  and unpredictable conditions
Consequently accidents in these areas  resulting from extensive construction
cannot be solely attributed to Act of God
Nevertheless even in challenging situations  people often seek a divine explanation
Consider this article
where a local resident claims that there  was a Baba Baukh Naths temple on the site
which was removed to make way  for the highway construction
He claims that this was the cause of the incident
Attempts to find a divine cause behind  natural or manmade disasters
are not unprecedented
In the case of the 2013 Kedarnath floods
some locals attributed the calamity to  the relocation of Dhari Devis shrine
during the construction of  the Alaknanda Hydroelectric Project
During the rescue efforts in the tunnel  where over 200 people were involved
a small temple was constructed at the  entrance of the tunnel on November 18th
and rituals were conducted
Interestingly this initiative wasnt  undertaken by the locals
but by NHIDCL
the same company overseeing the tunnel construction
However neither the temple
nor the subsequent rescue operation  would have been needed
had an emergency escape passage  been incorporated as per the original plan
When the Government sanctioned this project
they had clearly stipulated the necessity of an escape passage
a way out in case of emergency was mandatory
as per government guidelines
such emergency exits
are recommended for every tunnel  exceeding 15 km in length
PC Nawani the former director of the  Geological Survey of India emphasizes that
managing projects of this nature  without escape routes is impractical
The entire incident could have been  averted had proper precautions been taken
But anyhow lets get back to the incident
the truth was the workers were trapped indeed
How could they be rescued?
This marked the beginning of Operation Zindagi Operation Life
Uttarakhand government formed a fiveoption rescue plan
to be carried out by five distinct agencies
Oil and Natural Gas Corporation ONGC
Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam SJVNL
Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd RVNL
National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd NHIDCL
and Tehri Hydro Development Corporation THDCL
Additionally the Border Roads Organisation BRO
and the National Disaster Response Force NDRF
stood ready on the sidelines
offering assistance whenever required
The first step in the rescue operation focused on
ensuring a continuous oxygen supply to the trapped individuals
so that they could breathe properly
A compressed air pipe was manoeuvred  between the debris for this
Simultaneously a separate 4inch pipe was passed through the debris
to deliver snacks and dry fruits
These measures were implemented  on the first day November 12th
Notably electricity was being supplied in the tunnel
so the trapped individuals werent in complete darkness
There was some light
The following day a rescue plan was devised
involving horizontal drilling to create a passage
and passing a pipe through it
that would be big enough for people  to crawl through and escape
They had planned for horizontal drilling
Using an auger machine
This is how the machine looks
Since the first pipe had been passed on the first day
it was possible to communicate with the trapped workers
allowing constant interaction and  encouragement from the people outside
THDC operated from the other side of the tunnel
using microtunneling techniques
Additionally SJVN and ONGC were  gearing up for vertical drilling if necessary
Vertical drilling meant drilling a passage  from the top of the mountain to the tunnel
However geologists expressed reservations about vertical drilling
due to potential complications with weak stones
which could lead to further issues or even a landslide
If it wasnt executed perfectly
On 14th November horizontal drilling commenced
but the slow progress of the machine being used
and the additional debris caused by the drilling
led to the wall of debris becoming longer

Returning to our main topic
on November 15th
a decision was made to bring in  a new powerful machine
This machine transported from Delhi   via millitary aircraft in 3 parts
had to be assembled
It took a day
So by November 16th
the machine was ready for digging
with the capability to excavate 5 meters of debris per hour
While the initial day went smoothly
operations had to be halted the following day
due to a concerning cracking sound from the tunnel
The fear arose  could continued drilling  lead to further sinking of the tunnel?
A day was dedicated to thorough inspection
by then five days had passed
with no visible progress
The frustration among the workers relatives  and rescue officials escalated
resulting in a heated confrontation
One distressed person cried out about  his brother who was trapped for seven days
People were so angry and agitated that
to pacify the growing anger
Uttarkashi District Officer DP Baluni proposed
the idea of vertical drilling
People are agitated
so it was decided to
provide vertical openings  in addition to horizontal openings
for the rescue operation
The plan with respect to vertical drilling involved
digging a passage for 90 to 105 meters
Here the BRO played a crucial role  in constructing temporary roads
so that the drilling machines  could be transported to the top
This was being done simultaneously
preparations for vertical drilling began
along with the ongoing horizontal drilling from below
A significant development occurred on 20th November
when Arnold Dix a tunneling expert
and the president of the International Tunneling  and Underground Space Association
joined the rescue operation
Leveraging his expertise  Dix provided valuable suggestions
about what should be done next
On the same evening
rescuers successfully inserted a pipe of  6inch diameter through the wall of debris
This development expanded possibilities
since this pipe was wider
proper food could be delivered  to the trapped individuals
The workers received their first hot meal since they were trapped
a serving of hot khichdi
An endoscopic camera was passed  through the pipe to film the workers
This was the first video where we could see them
Beyond food the pipe became a conduit for medicines  mobile phones chargers and walkietalkies
The walkietalkies enabled direct  communication with the workers
On the same day it was decided to dig two additional tunnels
to create additional escape routes
By 21st November
four 900 mm pipes had been  successfully inserted through the debris
However the rescue operation was  still far from being successful
with the pipes interfering with the drilling
This interference led to a slight delay on November 22
Further setbacks occurred on November 23
when the platform upon which  the drilling machine was placed
had weakened
that night was spent repairing that structure
By November 24 the drilling machine had to be reassembled
and the sequence of challenges persisted
Once something was set right  something other broke down
On November 25 a significant setback unfolded
as the auger machine completely broke down
and was lodged in the tunnel
Arnold Dix informed reporters that
the drilling machine had already broken  down thrice during the rescue operations
and was now completely destroyed
The Auger is broken
Broken? Yeah broken
Yeah the machine is busted
Its irreparable
It is destructed
No more work from Auger
On November 26 authorities announced
their intention to attempt vertical drilling again
By then 20 meters had been drilled vertically
but the primary focus remained on horizontal drilling
with only 12 meters of drilling left
Recognizing the machines irreparable state  on November 27 a decision was made
to resort to manual drilling
by bringing in rat hole miners
Rat hole mining an old and  hazardous coal extraction method
was used in the past
It involved creating vertical passages by hand
The passage would be barely big  enough for a person to pass through it
Despite being banned in India by the National Green Tribunal
due to its adverse environmental impact
and the unsafe conditions for the miners
in this situation it was deemed the  best option for this rescue operation
A team of 12 rat hole mining experts worked diligently
and by the evening of November 28
it was reported that only 2 meters of digging remained
Everyone waited for the good news with bated breaths
and finally around 8 in the evening
the first worker was successfully  brought out on a stretcher
Subsequently one by one all 41 workers  were rescued from this tunnel
After 17 days of being trapped in  the collapsed tunnel in Northern India
rescuers have now freed all 41 workers
Munna Qureshi was one of these 12 rathole mining expert
he said that it was an emotional moment
He was the one who removed the last piece of debris
He could see them once he removed the last piece
He said that those workers hugged them
and thanked them once they were safely outside
They worked incessantly for 24 hours to rescue the workers
Qureshi said that his happiness knew no bounds
and that he did it for his country
Ambulances and helicopters stood ready outside
the rescued workers were adorned with garlands
and a freshly cooked meal awaited them
Potatoes and cauliflower stew roti lentil soup and rice
were served to them as they emerged
The entire nation celebrated the safe rescue of these 41 workers
and praises poured in for the rescuers
However amidst the celebration for  this happy ending it is crucial not to forget
the underlying cause of the incident
and the need to address its root cause
Waiting for an official investigation may not be necessary
as the actual reasons behind the incident are already known
The answer to the question lies within
the Char Dham Highway project
The same reason that is contributing  to the sinking of Joshimath
This socalled development in Uttarakhand
exemplified by projects like Char Dham adversely impacting the environment
escalating the risk of landslides and related accidents
I am not making this up look at this article
Tunnel collapse in Uttarakhand is a part  of a bigger problem in the Himalayas
In the construction of roads there was inadequate slope analysis
There is extreme slope cutting at some places
slopes have been cut up to 45 degrees to construct the roads
This can cause landslides easily
In fact the region has witnessed an average  of one landslide per day over the past 2 years
According to this article
Environmental activists have  raised concerns about this project
In February 2018
Citizens for Green Doon an NGO based in Dehradun
lodged a complaint with the National Green Tribunal NGT
highlighting the catastrophic impact of  this project on the Himalayan ecology
They pointed out that at that time 25000 trees  had already been felled for the project
violating the Forest Conservation Act
Furthermore the NGO emphasized that
according to Indian environmental laws
every highway project exceeding 100 km
requires an environmental impact assessment
However the government  unabashedly circumvented this regulation
they said that this wasnt a mega project  of thousands of kilometers of highways
they claimed to undertake 53 smaller projects
each highway with a length of  less than 100 kilometers
This mega project was presented as a cluster of small projects
simply to bypass this law
Consequently in September 2018 the NGT ruled that
the project did not need an environmental clearance
This order was later contested in the  Supreme Court of India in August 2019
leading to the appointment of a  26member HighPowered Committee
led by environmentalist Ravi Chopra
The committee had to investigate the potential  environmental and social ramifications
of this project in Uttarakhand
and provide recommendations based on their findings
In July 2020 the 4 members of this committee including Ravi Chopra
took note of the governments guidelines from March 2018
issued by the Ministry of Road and Transport Highways
These guidelines specified that highways constructed on mountains
should not exceed a total width of 7 meters
However the government aimed for  12meterswide highways on these mountains
The other 21 committee members  supported the governments plan
In response Ravi Chopra directly wrote to  the Environment Ministry in August 2020
expressing concern beyond tree felling
He emphasized that in addition to cutting down trees and mountains
the waste generated during road construction
was being indiscriminately dumped into rivers
particularly in ecosensitive zones
such as Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary
Valley of Flowers National Park
and Rajaji National Park
Waste was being dumped at such places
The following month in September 2020
the Supreme Court considered  Ravi Chopras recommendation
and ruled that the highways width  should not exceed 7 meters
This made sense as
wider roads would necessitate
more slope cutting tree removal
and more waste being dumped
which could destabilise the Himalayan terrain
and increase the chances of  landslides and flash floods
We observed unanimously
that the road width was the key factor
which determines the extent of hillcutting
and the subsequent environmental damage
However instead of adhering to the Supreme Courts decision the government
employed a new masterstroke
to circumvent the Supreme Courts direction
In November 2020 the Ministry of Defence entered the scene
appealing to the Supreme Court for
the construction of a doublelane road
citing it as a necessity for the Army
The Char Dham project was reframed
asserting that it was essential for  the countrys benefit and the Army
Thats why the roads had to be so wide
While the public had been initially informed
that the road construction was for the  Char Dham Yatra and religious pilgrimage
the projects purpose was suddenly recast
as a strategic imperative
Rooted in national interest
specifically facilitating the movement  of Indian troops to the Chinese border
The new reason was that since China
was constructing roads on its side of the border
India needed to do the same
However a major difference is the terrain
Chinas territory lies on the Tibetan Plateau
characterized by fewer mountains
a relatively stable landscape
building roads is easier there
with fewer adverse ecological impacts
Following this appeal by the Ministry of Defence
the Ministry of Highways modified its  2018 directives the subsequent month
stating that the 7meter guideline
could be expanded to 10 meters
if a project holds strategic importance
A year later on December 14 2021
the Supreme Court reluctantly approved
the continuation of the Char Dham project as it is
Consequently the highways in the  Char Dham project are 12 meters wide
Looking at how unabashedly the government
has disregarded rules and guidelines for this project
Ravi Chopra resigned from the committee
As of today the Char Dham project has  resulted in the clearance of 600 hectares of forest
the felling of over 56000 trees
and the widening of 75 of the Char Dham highway
The Ministry of Highways acknowledged  200 landslides in the area in 2021
And in November 2021 they admitted to the Supreme Court that
125 landslides were triggered around  the route of the Char Dham project
attributed to the construction work
Do you recall what I said in the video on Bhopal Gas Tragedy?
Before the incident journalists activists and experts
gave repeated warnings that
disaster may strike at any moment
Similarly experts and activists are giving warning repeatedly now
Look at these headlines
17th May 2023

23rd August 2023
Badrinath highway collapse is a warning
The Char Dham road project is a Freeway to Disaster
This was acknowledged by the Supreme Court 5 years ago
Look at this article from 2018
Frequent landslides in Uttarakhand on  Char Dham yatra marg raises questions
In light of this data and warnings
there are no indications of the plan being modified
The government is celebrating the rescue of the tunnel workers
There are indications that tunnel work will resume
Whats unfortunate is that
in the coming years we might get more news
of more such incidents in Uttarakhand
