Hello friends!
Is democracy over in our country?
This is a very serious question
Many of you will have a  simple answer to this question
Obviously not
We can vote for any political party we want
The politician who gets the most votes
comes in power
so obviously democracy still exists in our country
But this question is much deeper than that
The things that I am going to  show you in this video today
will be very shocking
After watching this video you will be forced to think
about the real answer to this question
Although if you are someone
that considers PM Modi to be a god
He is our god
We worship him
Prime Minister Modi  he is Gods incarnation to us
He is not a normal human
This countrys Prime Minister is the incarnation of Lord Vishnu
God incarnate
Or if you are someone
who thinks that Modis every action helps humanity
if youre already in awe of PM Modi
Modi is my husband  my brother my father my teacher
Okay What do you want to say?
Why do you feel like no one other than  Modi or Yogi can bring development?
I am in love with him
In such cases
it might be difficult for you
to open your eyes and look at the truth
But for the rest of the viewers
if you truly care about the country
watching this video is immensely important
Its not just about one incident
but many such incidents
that are happening one after the other
for the past few months  for the past few years
All those incidents point to one thing
that our country is moving forward towards One Nation One Party
Eradicating the voice of the opposition from the media
horsetrading of the MLAs
the taking away power from the elected governments
by making new laws
Weaponisation of investigative agencies
Pressuring and imprisoning  opposition politicians through ED and CBI
Interfering in state governments work through governors
Withholding funds from state governments
Taking away the right of the citizens to protest
And if someone protests
welcoming them with tear gas and rubber bullets
Using electoral bonds to hide their funding
And even if an opposition candidate manages to win the election
then committing election fraud  to declare themselves the winner
I would like to tell PM Modi
Have some decency!
Before talking about democracy friends
it is important to know what democracy actually is
It is a basic concept
but most people have a major  misunderstanding of this concept
Some people think that
if there are regular elections in the country
and you can go to vote
then it means that the country is a democratic country
But you know what?
Elections are held in North Korea too
I am not kidding
There are regular elections in North Korea
You can also see 100 voter turnout in those elections
But the only difference is that
if you do not vote for the official candidate elected by the government
you are considered antinational
Your job can be snatched away
your house can be snatched away
And if its just about the word democracy
then the official name of North Korea
the word democracy is included in it
North Korea is called the DPRK by their government
Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea
But what is the truth?
This country is a dictatorship
Similarly Russia is also considered a dictatorship
But elections are held there too
The only difference is that any candidate  who competes against Putin
is sometimes disqualified for some reason
or sometimes k!lled mysteriously
So one thing should be clear from this
merely having elections does not mean
that the country is a democracy
Elections need to be free and fair
Free means that the people have freedom
to vote for whom they want to
and Fair means that
different candidates and different political parties
have a fair chance of winning
It shouldnt be that one party has a lot of advantages
Recently the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation held its Mayor elections
For this election Congress and the AAP had formed an alliance
and had a total of 20 votes out of 35
It was clear by the party votes that
this alliance would win the elections
But when the elections actually took place
what did the presiding officer do?
This is not a secret
You can see the CCTV footage of what he did
He declared 8 Congress and AAP  votes as invalid
And this election fraud that took place here
was captured in the CCTV camera
In fact he was caught looking at the camera too
Look at his face
The way he is looking at the camera
it looks like he was caught stealing
And what was the result of the election?
BJP claimed to have won this election
Such an open election fraud
has probably never happened in the country before
The Chief Justice of India said that
this is a mrder of democracy
Although in a historic decision the Supreme Court
had to save this election
the question is
if there were no CCTV cameras here
or ballot papers
would this fraud have been caught?
This is just one example friends
Before that look at this news from 2021
An EVM machine was found in a BJP candidates car in Assam
After this the Election Commission had to order a repoll in this place
But no need to talk about old news
Look at this months news
February 2024
Three unknown people went to the Saswad Tehsil office in Pune
to steal the control unit of the electronic voting machine
Is this a joke?
Are our elections being conducted in a free and fair manner?
The Election Commission is an organisation
which is expected to conduct free and fair elections across the country
But the Election Commission has been accused
of being partial and biased
This accusation is very old
Initially BJP politician Narendra Modi had made this accusation
You heard it right
Before the May 2014 election
Narendra Modi accused the Election Commission
Although he won later elections
But in the last 10 years
the Election Commission has been accused so much that
Prashant Kishore said that
the Election Commission is an extension of BJP
He says that he has never seen such a  partial and biased Election Commission
That this Commission has always tried to bend the rules
And tried to make the schedule of elections in such a way that
BJP always benefits
The Election Commission has given very clear directions
that the Indian Army cannot be mentioned during political campaigns
But before the 2019 elections PM Modi
shamelessly asked for votes
using the martyrs and airstrikes
I want to ask my firsttime voters that
can your vote be dedicated to  the brave martyrs in Pulwama?
Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Adityanath went on to
call the Indian Army as Modis Army
And Modis army shts the terr0rists
When a complaint was filed with the  Election Commission regarding this
no action was taken for 21 days
And after 21 days the Election Commission gave its clean chit
The rules are clearly written
they are being openly violated
but still a clean chit
Its not the only clean chit
PM Modi has got such clean chits in at least 4 different cases
Amit Shah compared Rahul Gandhis constituency with Pakistan
This is also against the rules
But the Election Commission has given clean chits in this too
In total there are 7 such cases
in which Modi and Shah have received clean chits
NDTV had also reported that
one out of three election commissioners
had a dissenting opinion
in 5 out of the 7 cases
It means that there was an election commissioner
who believed that they should not be given clean chits
Later it was found that the name of this  election commissioner was Ashok Lavasa
Do you know what happened to him later?
His wife son daughter and sister all got  notices from the government agencies
The Citizen Commission on Elections in their report stated that
Ashok Lavasa was silently removed from the election commission
Just think this is an election commissioner
is this a democracy or a dictatorship?
In a democracy separation of powers
independence of institutions
is something you must have read about in school
Our Supreme Court had given an order
to strengthen the independence of the election commission
To have the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners
be appointed by a threemember committee
One of whom will be the Prime Minister
the other will be the opposition leader
and the third will be the Chief Justice of India
By doing this it could be ensured that
the Election Commissioner who is being appointed
will be truly independent
There will be no bias towards any entity
But a few months ago
the government brought in a new law
in which the government said that
the Chief Justice of India would be removed from this committee
Instead they added their minister to the committee
So in threemember committee
two of them will be from the government
to appoint the Election Commissioner
If BJPs intentions were clear
then why was such a law passed?
Why does the government want to control  the appointment of the Election Commissioner?
This was later challenged in the Supreme Court
but the Supreme Court did not take any action here
saying that this falls under the separation of powers
If the government is making a law
then the Supreme Court does not want to strike it
Even today the Election Commission has set a limit on
how much money can be spent on an MLA election and an MP election
In an MP election the limit is 95 million
BJP contested the election on 437 seats
So the total spending of the party
should not have been more than 415 billion
But how much did they spend?
It is written on the website of the Election Commission
1264 billion
how did the Election Commission allow this?
The Center for Media Studies also estimated that
BJP had spent 270 billion in the previous elections
Which was 45 of the total expenditure
If you look at the data of today
electoral bonds worth 160 billion have been sold
Out of these 160 billion  more than 100 billion went to BJP
15 billion to Congress
and 8 billion to TMC
All these amounts surpass the spending limit of the election
BJP leader Uma Bharti once said
Elections are a choice between bad and worse
Which is true
But think about it
If a social worker who has dedicated his life to serving people
how will he be able to bring 9 million to contest an election?
How will he be able to promote himself?
Especially when on the other side  the party has billions of rupees
The problem isnt limited to elections
Even if an opposition party forms the government
the government is then broken apart
Here countless allegations have been  levied against the BJP for horsetrading
People have repeatedly accused BJP
of taking MLAs to some resort
and buying them with an unimaginable amount of money
Are these allegations of horse trading true?
I cannot tell you because
I have never been to that resort
But you can imagine
all those MLAs in the resort wont be merely playing Ludo
Investigative agencies are responsible  for investigating such allegations
But if all the investigative agencies
dance to the tune of a single political party
then who will investigate these allegations?
Now imagine what would be going on in the MLAs homes
The politician who buys these MLAs
what would he say to his family?
Proudly telling them the good news
that he suppressed the voice of the people
That he strngled democracy
Hoping to be praised
And the other MLA who sold his soul for some money
what would he tell his family?
Proudly showing the money he brought in
By maligning the integrity of the nation by falling for horsetrading
Celebrating his lack of integrity
Its easy to get angry at such politicians
but theyre pitiful too
How miserable they are
how low they have fallen
Horsetrading and luring politicians with money is just one way
If an MLA doesnt fall for this
the second way is to use the investigative agencies
Using ED
weaponisation of ED
Last year 14 political parties had  complained to the Supreme Court
about how the government is using CBI and ED
against opposition leaders
They said that they have carried out  more than 3000 raids on political leaders
If you compare it with 2014
you can see a 4 fold jump in the number of ED cases against politicians
And 95 of the cases are registered against opposition parties
In response ED said that their conviction rate is very high
The conviction rate is 96
because the trials in 25 cases are over
and there was a conviction in 24 cases
But the truth is that from 2005 till now
ED has registered more than 5900 cases
The trial was conducted in only 25 cases
And the conviction was in only 24 cases
That translates to only 05 of the cases being substantial
Whenever an opposition politician is accused of corruption
and he joins BJP
all charges vanish suddenly
All cases against him are dropped
Someone had even written a poem on him
Washing Powder Modi
lies and frauds
it hides everything
even serious allegations disappear in a blink
When Himanta Biswa Sharma was in Congress
he was accused in the Saradha Chit Fund Scam
CBI called him for questioning in November 2014
And since 2015 when he joined BJP
7 more allegations of corruption have been filed against him
One allegation is about a land scam
another allegation is that he is running  syndicates in the silk and muga industry
But since he joined BJP
there have been no investigations on him
By the way the list of politicians who  went in BJPs washing machine is very long
Many of these politicians were previously  mentioned by PM Narendra Modi in his speeches
as examples of corruption
Calling NCP the Naturally Corrupt Party  and asking people to never vote for them
But as soon as these leaders joined BJP
the investigations stopped
and the corruption scams were forgotten
BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee had once said
where someone has to rely on corrupt individuals to gain power
he said that he wouldnt want to get near that power
If I get power
I dont even want to touch such power with a tong
But that era was completely different
That BJP and todays BJP
are vastly different
Today when Nitin Ghatkari is asked about Modis washing powder
he answers with a smile that
BJPs detergent is ecofriendly
Its important to win in elections
and the winner decides whats right or wrong
BJPs soap is washing away everyones scandals in a washing machine
Its an ecofriendly detergent
Whom do you agree with more?
Presentday Nitin Gadkari
or the former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee?
Comments below
Even despite the lure of money  and the pressure of ED
if an opposition politician doesnt join BJP
the proceedings against them continue
And in many cases
they are put in jail without being convicted
And they remain in jail for many months
AAP MP Raghav Chadda said that
if Manish Sisodia Satyendra Jain Abhishek Banerjee Sanjay Raut
Farooq Abdullah and Tejashwi Yadav join BJP
all the cases by ED and CBI against them
will be dismissed immediately
And people like Manish Sisodia and Satyendra Jain who are in jail
will be released immediately
Now to imprison someone after a conviction is a different matter
But here opposition politicians are being  sent to jail before they are convicted
The worst thing is that in the states where opposition governments exist
they are not allowed to work there
Not just one or two but many states have
repeatedly accused the Modi government that
they are using governors to interfere in the states daytoday affairs
They are preventing the state governments from working
The West Bengal government has said this
The West Bengal governor has been repeatedly blamed for this
The Tamil Nadu government has said this
The Delhi government has said this
The Kerala government has said this
Last year the Kerala government even accused the governor
of delaying the bills passed by the state government for 2 years
Delaying the bills approval
The state of Kerala even complained to the Supreme Court about this
The Supreme Court said that the governors cannot delay bills like this
That this is unconstitutional
The issue between the LG and the Delhi government in Delhi
has been in the news for many years
Over the last few years  CM Kejriwal has repeatedly said that
they are not allowed to work
The LG interferes in their work
The Delhi government approached the Supreme Court for this
and the Supreme Courts decision was in their favour
The Supreme Court stated that
LG should not interfere in this way
The real power should be in the hands of the elected government
But what did the Central Government do  after the Supreme Courts decision?
They brought a new law
to take away the powers of the Delhi government
Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Amendment Act 2023
The Modi government used this
to transfer many powers vested with  the Delhi government to the LG
We changed the hospitals
We made them grand
We arranged for all the medicines
They forced the officers to disrupt the flow of medicines
They stopped the tests
Last year for three months no tests could be run in the mobile clinics
They stopped the payments to the laboratories
They play dirty and are disgusting people
By passing one order one day
they removed the data entry operator  in all the government hospitals in Delhi
Now there is no one left to register patients in the hospitals
I ask them what do you want to do?
Do you want to k!ll the people of Delhi?
Think about it yourself friends
Even if you are a Modi fan
forget about him for a second
and ask yourself sincerely
If PM Modi was really worried about the country
the people of the country
would he have done such things?
Now some of you will think that
surely some opposition party has funded me to make this video
But I am telling you the truth
no political party has funded me
The things that I am showing you in this video
represents the reality of the country
If you are really concerned about the country
then you should open your eyes after seeing these things
News Laundry revealed an investigation report two days ago
that shows ED is used not only against other political parties
but also against companies in the country
At least 23 such companies which
hadnt donated any money to BJP yet
Central agencies raid their premises
and a pattern emerges
After the raid those companies donated millions of rupees to BJP
In total these companies donated 335 billion to BJP
which were subjected to IT or ED raid
So were these companies threatened to extort money?
Are our elections held in a free and fair manner?
Here the media also plays an important role too
Fair elections mean that the politicians of  the ruling party and the opposition
are given an equal chance to speak
Both get more or less equal media coverage
But what do we see in the media?
Day and night 247 the media sings praises the government
They praise the ruling party
Or repeat their talking points
Every mother in the country wants her son to be like PM Modi
and every son wants to be like Narendra Modi
Modi has the solution to everything
Theres no one like PM Modi
Modi built the New India
PM 1
Opposition parties may go on a Bharat Jodo Yatra
to make promises to the government
There was a time when on Doordarshan
the politicians of the ruling party and the opposition party
debated on important issues before the election on the news channel
Both had the right to defend their stance
Can today Doordarshan do this?
Today the BJP spokesperson doesnt even need to speak
because TV anchors have become BJP spokespersons
Instead of questioning the government on behalf of the people
they defend the government
And they defend the government to an extent that
they might start to hold the youth  responsible for increasing unemployment
And if you have elected an opposition party in the elections
then they will start insulting the people
And the people have turned away  from the national issues and BJP
They choose to vote based on
which party will give them free stuff
NDTV was the last TV channel
which dared to question the government
Ultimately NDTV was taken over by PM Modis friend Gautam Adani
Today TV news has d!ed a silent deth in our country
The government uses tax money to
give huge amounts of money to these TV  channels for running advertisements
and these TV channels work to suppress the voices of the citizens
If the real news doesnt reach you
will you be able to decide freely and fairly who to vote for?
Manipur was set ablaze for 77 days
but there were no special reports on TV channels
Recently the CAG of India presented 12 reports
which had a lot of irregularities
and instances of corruption
in government departments and ministries
Under the Ayushman Bharat scheme  more than 900000 people
were using only 3 mobile numbers
Millions of rupees were spent on the treatment of 3400 patients
who were already declared dead
When this CAG report came out
the government transferred the CAG officers
Have you heard this news on TV channels?
You havent
How will it reach you?
The second misunderstanding that people have is
they confuse democracy with majoritarianism
Imagine that you are travelling in a car with 5 people
One person in the car says that he wants to listen to loud music
He convinces his friend and the driver
that they should play loud music in the car
But you are travelling with your father who has a heart problem
You say that loud music should not be played
That person says that all of you should  vote to prove that its a democracy
And three people voted that loud music should be played
Your father and you are the two people  who say that loud music shouldnt be played
Since the majority voted to play loud music
in a democracy it would mean that loud music will be played in the car
Is this really democracy?
No this is stupidity
To give you a smallscale example in real life
then look at this circular from a society in Gurgaon
Dear Residents This is to inform you that
two wheeler not permitted inside our society
as per decision of the management
It means that only cars will enter the society
scooters and motorcycles cannot
Look at the unabashed discrimination
The management the RWAs
have been elected by the people
So even if you dont like this rule you would need to keep quiet
Because the majority has consented to this
they have elected the RWLO
People who confuse democracy and majoritarianism
must be thinking this
This is not just about one society
there are many such societies all over the country
where you will find such stupid rules if not stupider
Look at this article from 2019
A bank employee is saying that her sister didnt get an apartment on rent
Because many RWOs blacklisted her
just because her sister was an air hostess
Some societies say that they cant rent an apartment to an air hostess
because of their odd work timings
Often these RWAs make up any baseless rule they want to
For example in some societies in Noida
entry and exit fees have been imposed
Anyone who wants to rent an apartment in these societies
will have to pay an entry fee
And they will of course be required to pay the rent to the landlord
but when they leave the society
they have to pay an exit fee
The majoritarianism at the local level in the country
Some people think this about politicians and governments
Once the politicians are elected and they are in power
they can make any rule they want
On the Preamble to our Constitution
4 words are clearly written
Liberty Equality Fraternity and Justice
These 4 words are the cornerstones of democracy
In fact Dr Ambedkar went one step further
He said that these 4 words are the principles of life
So a majority vote doesnt mean that
you can take away someones natural rights
discriminate against them or make nonsense rules
This is why we can say that some of the decisions taken by the government
go against democracy
In the language of the Supreme Court
they are unconstitutional
Like just a few days ago
the Supreme Court struck down the Electoral Bonds Scheme
calling it unconstitutional
The court said that the government had made an arbitrary rule
Why was this Electoral Bonds Scheme unconstitutional
and against the welfare of the people?
I have talked about this in previous videos
So it was a good step by the Supreme Court
even though the decision was a bit late
but at least the took the right decision
in favour of democracy and the people
But holding the government accountable
is not only the Supreme Courts responsibility
but in a real democracy
this is the job of the opposition
media civil society and the citizens
And for this reason
mechanisms like RTI Right to Information Act exits
Which gives us data about the government
For the same reason the media is called the fourth pillar of democracy
so that it will hold the government accountable
But what is the situation today?
Till date PM Modi has held zero press conferences
where unscripted questions have been asked
Accountability is at absolute zero
Forget the press conference
he doesnt have the courage to face one unscripted question
When Dr Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister
he held press conferences or addressed the press at least 117 times
The last time a proper press conference was held in our country
by the Prime Minister
it has been more than 10 years since that day
In that last press conference
62 unscripted questions were asked to PM Dr Manmohan Singh
with more than 100 journalists present
In a true democracy
this accountability is the reason
which gives the citizens the right to protest
If the managers elected by our country
are not interested in being held accountable under the RTI
arent comfortable with being accountable to the media
then they will have to be held accountable by the citizens
A positive example of this was recently seen in UP
when the UP government made a very strange and undemocratic rule
They issued guidelines for coaching centres
that they should not conduct classes for girls after 8 pm
If they do action will be taken against them
And what was the governments justification?
That it was necessary for the safety of girls
But does this make any sense?
Instead of controlling the ones who are a threat to girls
instead of controlling the problematic elements
they tried to put the girls in cages
protested against these rules
And after the protest
the UP government withdrew the ban
This small incident shows
the power of the people in a democracy
But what if the right to protest is taken away from people?
Recently when farmers had to go back to the streets to protest again
the government welcomed them with sharp nails
In some places roads were dug
to completely block the roads
Then rubber bullets were fired at the farmers
tear gas was thrown at them using drones
As if this was a war zone
The photos of the border crossing made it look like
this was the national border with China
Even there there are no arrangements like this
And in the news it is being reported that
at least 3 farmers went blind
because of the rubber bullets fired by the police
We will talk about the reasons behind this protest
and the demands of the farmers
in a separate video
But for now this doesnt matter
The point here is that
the government treating citizens peacefully protesting like this
Is this right?
Before this there was the wrestlers protest
The police behaved similarly back then too
This was the case in the last farmer protest too
Numerous farmers lost their lives during the protest
According to an article from 2021
at least 600 farmers were killed in the last farmers protest
And these are the protests that you get to hear about in the news
because these protests have gotten bigger than a certain limit
Apart from this most of the protests that were held over the last few years
have never been talked about in the news
Did you know about Kashmiri Pandits protests that lasted more than 40 days?
About the government employees protesting against the old pension scheme?
Or the protest in Hisar that continued for more than 400 days?
Against the closing of the Doordarshan Kendra
Or the doctors protest last year
or the protest by the unemployed youth
Dont delude yourself that this has nothing to do you
since you are not taking part in these protests
Because tomorrow if you are subjected to any injustice
if the government takes any decision
that goes against your rights
And you go out to protest to defend your rights
What do you think?
Wont you be treated the same way
these farmers are being treated today?
Are you special?
If the government is treating all the protesters this way
then you wont get any special privilege
Now this question that I asked you at the beginning of the video
I would like to ask again
Is democracy still alive in the country today?
Whatever your answer may be
but one thing is for sure
if the situation continues to deteriorate this way
it will not take much time for us to fall  to the levels of North Korea and Russia
Democracy will exist on paper
elections will also be held
but in the real sense
democracy will have breathed its last breath
Thank you very much!
