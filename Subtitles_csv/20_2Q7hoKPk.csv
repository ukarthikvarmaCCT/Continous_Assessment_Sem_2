Dating Raghav has just made you this uptight person
Hey!  You havent met them for 10 years!
I mean it will be fun to see if
people have changed or not at all
Just do me a favour Just give it a thought
If I wanted to see somebody from school I would have by now
And everyone who I want in my life is alrready in it
Like you  I know
Thanks But thats not true
If I tell you something you wont believe me
But let me tell you something you still miss Deva
I havent thought about her for a long time
Ans she doesnt miss me
Where is the pickle from Aarya?
It had fungus so I threw it away
What else did you throw away?
My electric shaver is missing too
That got spoilt
You would have got a shock
That didnt happen with your taunts though right?
You know if you didnt insist on being this man child
there would have been no need for me to taunt
I know I know all this lecture
If you know everything you can try to change atleast
What do you mean?  I mean I am fed up
of your childish behaviour
I have a life and Id really like to go and live it
but I am out of such  Hold on
I didnt ask you to do that You are doing it by yourself
In fact it would be better if you dont do it
Yes because its a perfect life
You dont go to work You stay at home and drink
Watching stupid  This is also my house
I am paying the rent for the last four months
Im chasing my dream and it takes time
How would you know about it? You dont have any dreams
Youre living your comfortable life
Dev I did and you know it
Then we got married and life happened
but I knew that I have responsibilities
and we worked together as a team
I know that we are us and we were never just I
Was that supposed to be an explanation?  Oh shut up
Okay lets recall
We met in school and started dating
And then suddenly we got married because that was your right time
Then you wanted to move to US because that was your right time
And you wanted to do a family planning
because that was your bloody right time
Did you ever think that was the right time for me?
Your right time?
You never wanted to marry after being together for seven years
You wanted me to keep waiting around for you
to figure out what your right time was?
I wish I had spent those years in chasing my dreams
I wouldve really  You dont know that Dev
You know everything  I do  Wow!
So you know very well where the cushions have to be kept
because thats how you planned it
Wine glasses have to be clean right?
The bedsheets should be clean crisp
and there shouldnt be grease on it
As per your plan
Well get married at the age of 25 because thats how you planned it
Well plan our family at 29! You know what?
Hell with you and your planning!
You spent your entire life planning!
Have you ever realised?
Have you ever lived those moments with me?
I enjoyed being with you Dev
I enjoyed being married to you
I enjoyed doing up this house
Why do we always end up discussing this?
Because all I wanted was
to watch and enjoy my match
with my friends and my beer
Of course!
Seeing messages from your reunion group
Thats why I called
Is Deva coming?  Dev said yes So
I guess yes
Hang on!
Woah! Good Lord!
Listen Deva just replied Shes coming!
Okay! Good night!
Good morning!
Yeah! Good morning!
Its 830 in the morning

No namecalling no sarcasm
Lets just be nice
Was this request for you or for me?
For both of us
Listen Deva
Ill take my own time Please

I hate saying this but we used to be the perfect couple
I mean people used to look up to us
And we were in love and we got married
And I know were
a little but
Its a rough patch and its just
If we go there like this fighting
in front of everyone Can we please just be
End of the day you are just concerned
about what theyll think
Okay fine Lets just be
cordial to each other
Just that
What do I think about now?
These passing winds say it all
Well meet when at leisure
All of us will meet again
This life is so unpredictable!
