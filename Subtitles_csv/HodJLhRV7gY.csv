Hello friends!
Shahrukh Khans newly released film Jawan
is breaking all records
This film is getting a lot of love from the public
But do you know that more than half of the incidents shown in this film
are inspired by real life?
You will be shocked to know how
significant is the connection between the things shown in this film and real life
Lets find out in todays video
In this video I wont give any major spoilers of plot points of the film
So even if you havent seen the film
you can watch this video without any hesitation
In fact if you havent seen the film
you may get more curious to watch the film
after seeing the real issues in this video
Lets start with the second big scene  of the first half of the film
which is set in a government hospital
In the film Jawan it is shown how
young children in government hospitals die of encephalitis
because oxygen may not be available
In the film a very sincere doctor Iram is shown
who tries her best to save the children
But after this incident is made public
the government frames this doctor instead
A false accusation is put on her
and she goes to jail
Something similar happened in August 2017
in real life in the city of Gorakhpur
In a government hospital BRD Medical College
63 children died within 3 days
when the piped oxygen supply of the hospital ran out
Dr Kafeel Khan was working as a paediatrician at that time
When he came to know that the oxygen  supply in the hospital was nearly over
he tried to inform the authorities
Since there was no response
he tried to procure oxygen supply from himself
at his own expense
He is seen as a reallife hero
But when the news of this incident reached the media
the blame is shifted on the Dr Kafeel
The government accused him of medical negligence and corruption
He was suspended from his job
arrested and then he was in jail for 9 months
In an interview he reveals how mercilessly he was beaten in jail
He was starved for 45 days
He was in such a bad condition that  he couldnt sleep on his back for months
They used to make me naked
they used to beat me with a stick
They didnt give me food and water for 45 days!
In April 2018 he finally got bail from Allahabad High Court
The court stated that there was no evidence of his wrongdoing
In 2017 an inquiry panel was set up
to investigate the allegations against him
Even the panel stated that
the allegations against him are baseless and inconsistent
In fact this panel report states that
on 11th and 12th August
due to his honest efforts
more than 500 jumbo oxygen cylinders were  delivered to this hospital by different companies
The film Jawan shows how when the doctor had no other option
she started giving Ambu bags to the parents
This happened in real life too
During the Gorakhpur tragedy there were reports
that when oxygen was depleted
parents were using Ambu bags to save their childrens lives
They were trying their best
and many parents saw their children dying in front of their eyes
Dr Kafeel said that
he was made a scapegoat
and that it was a manmade tragedy
More than 30 letters were written to the authorities of BRD Medical College
and to the UP government
Bills of 63 million rupees were pending
to the oxygen suppliers
which were not paid for months
Again and again the letters asked them
to pay the oxygen suppliers
so that the oxygen supply to the hospital would not be disrupted
Just one day before the Gorakhpur tragedy
on 9th August
Uttar Pradeshs Chief Minister Adityanath visited this hospital himself
I made a video on everything that happened at that time
if you havent seen it Ill put the link in the description
We often hear that the state of government  hospitals in the country is very bad
but how bad is it actually?
And what impact does it have on peoples lives?
We got to know this from this film
and from Gorakhpur Tragedy
To improve the condition of these government hospitals
a bold statement is given in the film
It is said that if there is a will
then all these hospitals nationwide
can be improved in just 5 hours
This thing is quite filmy
but in real life I believe that
even if not in 5 hours
but definitely in 2 to 3 weeks
all hospitals can be improved
And you can bring this efficiency and speed to your life

Now lets get back to the topic
The second major issue that has been shown in the film is
faulty weapons
Our soldiers are martyred in our country
not by the bullets of the enemy
but because of our own faulty weapons
which are manufactured
by some crony capitalists
In reality there have been many reports on this over the years
In 2012 the Chief General of the Indian Army VK Singh
wrote to PM Manmohan Singh
and said that the Armys tank fleet
was in dire need of critical ammunition
In 2015 retired Lieutenant Colonel Deepak Malhotra
filed a PIL in the Delhi High Court
with the accusation that due to bureaucratic hurdles
our soldiers have to use weapons of poor quality
which puts their lives at risk
In this PIL an interview of an injured soldier was mentioned
in which he talked about how due to defective INSAS
a massacre took place in Chhattisgarh
In 2017 a CAG report mentioned that
40 of the Indian Armys ammunition
is at such low levels that
if a war breaks out
they will not last more than 10 days
In 2018 the Indian Army rejected  Made in India rifles for the second time
Because these Made in India rifles failed badly during trials
These reports are not yet over
Listen to more
In 2020 an internal army assessment flagged that
due to such bad weapons
In the last 6 years 403 accidents have taken place
and 27 soldiers have been martyred
at a loss of 96 billion rupees
These weapons were supplied by the Ordnance Factory Board
After this in September 2022
last years Bloomberg report states that
because of PM Modis MakeInIndia push
our defence forces are not able to import some critical weapons systems
Because of this India is quite vulnerable to  threats coming from China and Pakistan
I would like to show you a report from this year
In the last 5 years around 55 soldiers have lost their lives
in more than 50 aircraft and helicopter accidents
In a bigger time frame
there was a report in 2022
which stated that more than 400 MiG21s crashed in the last 60 years
Due to this 200 pilots and 60 civilians lost their lives
This issue was also raised in the film Rang De Basanti if you remember
This is a major plot point of the film
Now lets come to our third big issue
Corporate Funding
In the film Jawan it is shown how
corporate money is secretly used
for funding the political parties
In 2017 there was a major development regarding this
Modi government had passed the Finance Bill 2017
through which giving secret donations to political parties was allowed
through Electoral Bonds
This bill also removed the limit
on how much money can be given to a political party in donations
How much money was given?
This year in January a report was published
which said that during 20182022 BJP
received 5270 billion of funding secretly
We dont know who provided this funding
because that was the aim of the bill they passed
They wanted to hide their funding
According to this report during this time
Congress party received 960 billion in funding
and Trinamool Congress received 767 billion
In 2014 Narendra Modi had promised that
he would bring the black money from Swiss banks back to India
For once
the money that has been deposited in  foreign banks by these thieves and robbers
if we bring back the money
even by doing so
every single poor man in India
will get 152 million for free
But what have they done here?
They have hidden all the money that is received by their parties
Now whether it is BJP Congress or any other party
the public cannot know who is funding them
We can just take a guess from the outside
Another thing worth mentioning here is that
there is an expenditure limit
to what a candidate can spend on his political campaign
This depends on the state
but in Lok Sabha elections this limit is  between 75 million to 95 million
If we take the upper limit for every seat in Lok Sabha
543 seats multiplied by 95 million
it is around 5 billion
So technically no political party can spend more than 5 billion
Going over the expenditure limit is not allowed
However the report of the Centre for Media Studies has shown that
the BJP has spent 270 billion  in the Lok Sabha elections of 2019
Just think about the difference
Even if you ignore this report
in November 2019 BJP submitted to the Election Commission
as it is written on the website of the Election Commission
that BJP has spent 1264 billion for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
The maximum limit here is 5 billion
and they are spending 12 billion
Is this a joke?
In the film Jawan it is shown that the villain of the film
is telling foreign investors how
voters in India can be bought
If you pay 10000 to each voter
they will vote for the payers preferred political party
This is shown wrongly in the film
because 10000 is a huge amount
In our country we see that
people sell their vote for a kilogram of chicken  or a quarter of whisky
Obviously it depends from region to region
on how much money is used to buy voters
But in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
there were seizures worth 3456 billion
It includes cash gold silver alcohol drugs everything
And forget about buying voters
theres a new trend in the market
Political parties buy MLAs
they buy media houses
Casinos horse trading horse racing
And then these MLAs and media houses that have sold themselves
play a game of divide and rule with the public
spreading hatred among the people
so that their political masters can remain in power
The film also raises the issue of the environment of the country
How several industrial factories
pollute our air and water
In the film there was a reference to the Bhopal gas tragedy
which happened in December 1984
I will not talk about this here because
I have made a separate video on this
If you havent seen it I will put the link in the description
But it is not about just one tragedy
not about just one incident
This has become so common that it is unbelievable
Just do a random Google search
and see the numerous articles pop up
Lets start in 2006
In Chhattisgarh due to iron ore mining
the water of two rivers got polluted
and 100 villages that were on the banks of the rivers
the villagers living there had to use contaminated water
for their daily needs
In 2013 a report by the Center for Science and Environment shows that
80 of Indian sewage
is dumped untreated into rivers
Who is doing this?
Thousands of factories are dumping untreated sewage in rivers
In 2017 Maharashtras polluting factories  are making its rivers the filthiest in India
In September 2018
Magsaysay Award winner  environmentalist Rajendra Singh said that
the governments Namami Ganga project is failing
In October 2018 GD Agarwal a passout of IIT
became a sadhu
Swami Gyan Swaroop Sananand
To save the River Ganga he went on a fast
His demand was that a Ganga Protection Act be drafted by the government
and a total ban be imposed on
quarrying and stone crushing on the banks of the River Ganga
He had also written a letter to PM Modi
but there was no reply
His fast lasted 111 days
after which he passed away due to starvation
The man who dedicated his life to get River Ganga cleaned
environmentalist GD Agarwal
finally sacrificed himself for River Ganga
After that PM Modi did express his condolences
The budget of the Namami Ganga project was
200 billion
Its deadline was 2021
This year Namami Ganga Mission 2 was approved
With a budget of 225 billion
The deadline was set for 2026
The Minister of State for Jal Shakti Water Resources  clearly told the Rajya Sabha that
this time their main objective
is to meet the water quality criteria of outdoor bathing
Not to make the water of River Ganga drinkable
Only so clean that it becomes bathable
They will try to make it happen by 2026
Lets move ahead there are other rivers as well
This article from 2021
Karnataka dumps 1746 million litres of sewage in the rivers every day
40 untreated
Experts say that factories and industries should be blamed for this
April 2022
the water of the River Hindon in Noida Uttar Pradesh
is so bad that it is not even safe to bathe there
September 2022
the water of the River Damodar in Jharkhand
has become toxic
People are getting sick by using this water
Local power stations and mining companies
dump large mountains of ash in this river to save money
In 2023 the Central Pollution Control Board says that
there are 413 industries in Haryana in total
which are discharging untreated wastes into the river
Panipat is at number one
with 181 polluting factories
Gurgaon is at number two
with more than 100 such factories
This is why the villain in the film Jawan
openly tells foreign investors in the film
to invest their money in winning elections
to invest in donating to the parties
so that they will get the freedom to do anything in India
To set up as many factories as they want
to use as much cheap labour as they want
to spread pollution and waste
and no one would care
The villain of the film also says that
Indias environmental regulations are very favourable
for big companies
In other developed countries there are a lot of restrictions
that are not there in India
For example some pesticides are banned in other countries
but are allowed in India
The Supreme Court was hearing a petition
demanding a ban on 116 dangerous pesticides
In 2013 the Anupam Verma Committee was constituted
to investigate these dangerous pesticides
This committee reviewed only 66 pesticides
and submitted its report to the government in 2015
But the government remained inactive for years
and when the government took action in 2018
only 12 pesticides were banned by the government
And it said that 6 other dangerous pesticides would be slowly phased out
Out of the 116 dangerous pesticides
they took steps to ban only 18
After this another committee was formed under SK Malhotra
in which some more pesticides were to be reviewed
This committee in 2020 said that
27 pesticides should be banned in India
In 2022 the government formed another committee
And what action did that committee take?
Only 3 pesticides were banned
That too in February 2023
So now you can understand the attitude of the government
They are not worried about the citizens  but about the crony capitalists
If they ban any more pesticides
then the business of these billionaires will be affected
They should not have to bear the loss
In July 2023 the Supreme Court questioned the government
The Supreme Court said that whenever a committee issues a report
instead of taking action on that report
the government makes a second committee
Why is it so difficult
to ban these dangerous pesticides
which are already banned in other countries?
After this we can talk about food safety regulations
Look at this 2017 news
Experts say that poultry farms in India
are using antibiotics
Antibiotics are being given to hens in such heavy doses that
this antibiotic resistance is reaching humans
This means that if humans catch a disease
that has become antibioticresistant
then the antibiotics will not help these humans
After this the government did something good here
in 2017 they set a permissible limit
on how much antibiotics can be given to hens
But look at this news from 2018
Indias farmed chickens
are dosed with the worlds strongest antibiotics
This study was done by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism
which found that a last resort antibiotic Colistin
is being given in heavy doses to many chickens in India
Only in 2019 the Union Health Ministries took action on it
and banned this antibiotic
So even where action is being taken
they are waiting for a report first
only then any action is taken
This should tell you the importance of free media
If all the media in a country has been turned into political representatives
then such reports will not be published
and the government will never have to take any action
Without these reports the government  never takes any action on these things
Compare it with other countries
The European Union banned antibiotics  from being used in animal feed in 2006
They took action so many years ago
This year in January the European Union  came out with a new legislation
which has banned all kinds of antibiotics in farming
And they have also banned
meat that has antibiotics in it
being imported from foreign countries to the European Union
Now see how these multinational food companies
take advantage of the indifference of the Indian government
In 2017 KFC was praised in America
because they committed not to use antibiotics in their chicken
In the same year Burger King McDonalds Pizza Hut and Taco Bell
all took this pledge
There will be no antibiotics in their chicken
But did any of these fast food companies
make such a commitment in India?
Center for Science and Environment  reached out to these companies in 2020
and they did not respond to this issue
In the movie Jawan it is also shown how
the government forgives the bad loans of these billionaires
If you want to compare it with real life
see this news from just last month
The Minister of State for Finance told the Lok Sabha
that in the last 9 years the banks
have written off 1456 trillion in NPAs
More than half of these were owed by large corporates
And when the banks try to recover these loans
the banks are unable to recover the entire amount
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman  told the Rajya Sabha this year in March
that in the last 5 years the public sector banks
could recover only 14 of the writtenoff loans
Apart from these NPS there are cases of such billionaires
who have taken loans from banks
and fled the country
Like Vijay Mallya Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi
The film Jawan drew an interesting comparison
of loan writeoffs for these billionaires and crony capitalists
And the loans owed by common farmers in the country
Look at this India Spend report of 2019
The cost of the top 12 corporate NPAs
is twice as much as compared to farm loan waivers
Between FY 201718 and February 2019
10 state governments issued farm loan waivers
whose total amount was 1848 billion
But the top 12 NPAs
their total amount is almost twice this
At 345 billion
And when the farmers loan is waived
there is another big difference
If the farmer is unable to repay his loan
he often commits sde
But these billionaires
have you ever heard that they committed sde  because they couldnt repay their loans?
There is a very powerful scene related to this in Jawan
I wont talk much about it
If you have seen the film you will understand
what I am talking about
When a farmer takes a loan
it affects his life entirely
If you see just one year in 2021
more than 10000 people committed sde in the farm sector
The number shown in the film was quite shocking
But the number in real life is close to it
There are farmers in our country that earn substantially
They should be seen as positive examples
so that other farmers can learn from them
Watch this video of Down to Earth
How can a small farmer earn 15 million?
Or watch this video featuring Padma Shree awardee Bharat Bhushan Tyagi
which shows how a farmer earns more  than 500000 per acre annually
Or you can read this article of The Better India
which shows the story of a farmer Raju Titus
All these farmers can earn so much money
because they follow the NFC model
NFC means Nature Farmer Consumer
There may be some minor differences
but what do these farmers do in general?
Number 1 seed preservation
They preserve the seeds in seed banks
They are often members of friendly seed banks
Number 2 they do not use chemical fertilizers
Instead they restore soil fertility
by planting cover crops in between the cash crops
This increases microbial activity in the soil
and increases nitrogen availability
And such farmers often use a compost pit for manure
Number 3 they often get their soil tested in local labs
to find out the most suitable crop to grow in the soil
They also practice crop rotation
Number 4 Monoculture
Instead of planting one type of crop
they carry out intercropping
Multiple crops in one field
That would support each other
Number 5 They do multilayer farming
3 to 4 crops are grown on the same field at different heights
For example coconut coffee and black pepper  can be a combination
Or maize green gram and ground nut
can be another combination
Next they dont use a tractor
They often use notill farming techniques
And they dont use flood irrigation either
Instead they use techniques like sprinkler irrigation or drip irrigation
And instead of using pesticides and insecticides
they use marigolds garlic or brightcoloured sheets
Next they follow the practice of mulching
They cover the remaining area with organic matter
so that weeds can be suppressed
and that water can be retained in the ground
And finally these people dont dump their produce in the market
Instead they are organised in cooperatives
and reach the consumers directly
They dont let middlemen in
This is an amazing model in which
the farmer is happy the consumer is happy  and the environment is also happy
But this model is used rarely
because most of the people who are practising this model
are educated and intelligent
However poor farmers use the corporate model of farming
They buy seeds fertilizers insecticides  pesticides and tractors
They use diesel to run the tube well
They rent a harvesting machine
They burn the leftover stubble
which causes air pollution
As time goes by their soil becomes less fertile
So they keep adding more fertilizers to it
And in the end they dump all their stuff in the market
Often they take a loan for a tractor as well
And their crop often gets destroyed during the rains
This model is very expensive
The revenue for the farmers is meagre
And it has a bad impact on the environment
And because these corporate companies work like middlemen
the consumers have to pay a high price
And most of the profits are taken by these companies in the middle
These companies that make tractors  fertilizers and insecticides
are billiondollar companies
And often the profits cannot reach these farmers
because this knowledge has not reached most of the farmers
The government had promised that by 2022
they would double the farmers income
But its 2023
and the farmers are in the same condition
A while ago the government tried to bring in 3 unfavourable laws
which would have increased the corporate income
But thankfully it didnt pass
What should the government do?
Educate the farmers
To inform the farmers which models they should adopt
What they should be doing to maintain their livelihood
If there is a political will
the government can bring down these farmer sdes to zero
But will this happen?
Or will the YouTubers have to educate the farmers?
Only time will tell
If you liked the video do keep these  issues in mind while watching the film
And if you liked the video you can click here
to watch the video on the Bhopal Gas Tragedy
See you in the next video
Thank you very much!
