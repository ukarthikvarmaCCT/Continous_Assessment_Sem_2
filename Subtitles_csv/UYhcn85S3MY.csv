English
maybe we should just settle this
but where
oh i know
how about up there
oh you must pardon me
i forgot you have no way of making it up
to that divine beast on your own
actually scratch that one for now link
canonically cannot jump upwards
infinitely lets not be silly here
yet you have no way of making it up to
that divine balloons
link fueled by rivalis reverse
psychology scoured the land sending the
octorocks of hyrule to near extinction
for their balloons wielding a korok leaf
and mounting a trusty wooden box he set
with patience and precision links
dangerous excursion upwards leads him
straight to rivali on vonnetto
to accept his oneonone challenge and
then kick his ass hypothetically
unfortunately in my demonstrations
vomitto doesnt come with collision
link did not have the paraglider back
then but it wouldnt be a stretch to say
he could make one
and with that
chaining together a series of spicy
peppers in order to create an updraft
even taller than rivales gale
cant reach high enough this gets left
out as an honorable mention
okay this method requires the sheikah
slate which was in the possession of
zelda 100 years ago
but hypothetically speaking lets say
link was
fueled by reverse psychology
this is the sheikah slate eh
he steals it enters oman aw shrine as
the swords chosen one gets magnesis and
constructs his own flying machine out of
two mine carts to go kick rivalis ass
stealing the sheikah slate and exploring
ancient chica structures for power is
the norm now do you want to prove your
volley right no you have stasis now a
paraglider you constructed yourself and
a pretty metal box youre ready to hit
yourself really hard with to prove a
get a fairy youll be fine climb to
hebrew peak build up enough kinetic
energy to kill a henox hit yourself with
it and glide over to valmeado to kick
rivallis ass
how did link get a wooden box on top of
hebra peak
i dont know he built it with all of his
wood or something
with similar disregard for ones own
body a wellplaced bomb with this light
wooden box can send link far and fast
enough to reach valmeado and kick
rivallis butt
do you need a butthole to have a butt
i dont know the full anatomy of a rito
but if we assume theyre like other
birds he has a cloaca
but does that meet the specifications of
a button
then link kicks him in the cloaca
that doesnt have the same ring to it
sometimes theres just a single moment
the straw that breaks the camels back
the burning rage in your soul unlocks
your potential
to do
the impossible
were disregarding the laws of physics
rocks no more than you can fathom
study them empathize with them shift
your values to theirs
and with new understanding
you may become untethered to the earth
and were back its the moon jump glitch
i cant explain this one immersively you
mount a horse you mount a different
horse and then everything is wacky
link makes it to varmetto
rivali is in disbelief this isnt
in a moment where his insecurity should
have been reinforced
the act is dropped
and he confesses his feelings for link
after all these years i simply must
admit the truth
they embrace
forever sealing the darkness of their
bitter history into the past
the true darkness
that which holds true love from
ride to the highest peak of hebrew
create a time split and instruct your
split self to ride back to rito staple
position their steed on a slope facing
away from the divine beast
and remount to tether your alternate
existence back together
reforming the split timeline generates
enough force onto link to send him
flying at mach speed towards vametto
to look at your world
its possibilities
its limitations and master them
to look beyond your world your time
and seek a new level of possibility
that is what you must do
enter a shrine with a device known as an
traverse to an alternate timeline as you
interact with it
do this twice
the power of the apparatus travels with
and bonds you to the very earth you
head to the death mountain of this
and bond yourself to its molten lava
becoming one with fire
head to the monster camp west of rito
with precisely 550 bomb arrows stashed
for use
right when va meadows flight path fully
crosses over the entrance of passer hill
leap off the cliff edge and grab hold of
your bomb arrows one by one
given that your calculations and
execution were precise your 550th bomb
arrow will safely land you on top of von
meadow from the second loop of its
flight path
where you can finally meet revolve
and then link kicks his cloaca
thank you to all my patrons over on
you people are wonderful
e says nice this is awesome
no e youre awesome
jonathan shamus says why advise people
on proving the odds are you planning to
just purposely not read those comments
now this is a good question
toavah says bionicle
thanks for watching bye
youll have a precise speed on ganon
from this vantage point
and when the time is right
give him everything youve got
now we wait for that perfect moment
meadow weve been artfully patient for
the last 100 years
i doubt youll suffer a feather over a
few more moments
