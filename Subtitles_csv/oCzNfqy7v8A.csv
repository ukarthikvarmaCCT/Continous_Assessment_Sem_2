OK! Ill tell you
Maya found your Linked in
and thats how we got to know your work place
And uhh
I got onto people finder
Wait waitwhat?
I got 3 numbers from there
Wait people finder?
Which means you subscribed?
Yeah! How else?
No way!
So for someone who is totally cut out from this world
What other way to contact?
Okay go on
Yeah so hmm
I had three numbers
And I randomly picked a number and texted
It ended up being a wrong guy!!
Can you imagine?
I texted a complete random stranger
Oh man!
You texted a random person
and you didnt know it wasnt me?
Yeah!! how am I supposed to know?!
Oh come on! Thats ridiculous huh
Well! To start with
You were not the most receptive person
Were you?
Then the 2nd number
had the picture of your daughters
The older one
looks ditto like you
and thats how I confirmed
Amazing na?!
Why after all these years?
I dont know
this meaning you and me
uh what do I say?
There is this box of memories which I hold on to
and I completely own it!
Just way too special to me!
This is  just a way
of re visiting something
that was long left behind
uhh I dont know
I wish I knew
Its okay
You dont have to tell me
Its ok
I seriously dont know
Even even I
You know even I have been thinking about this why part
Its like
How do I put it
Its like
You finish reading this book and
there is this one page
which you really like
And you go back to fetch that page
and relive it once more
Thats what I guess
I agree and no umm
I dont really want to know the reason
its okay
