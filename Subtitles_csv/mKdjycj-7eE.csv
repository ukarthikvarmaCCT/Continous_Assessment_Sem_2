Sitting on these train tracks
is a quarter million dollar Lamborghini
And barreling down at it
right now is a massive train
But before the impact Im giving this Lamborghini to Blake
Thank you
And on top of sending the train
Im also gonna have these eight soldiers
shoot 10000 bullets at your Lamborghini
Thats the scariest thing Ive ever seen
Yeah its gonna be fun
And you have exactly 24 hours to build whatever you want
to protect your Lambo from the bullets
The timer starts now
Okay first line of defense
Im thinking a wall of cinder blocks after that
some shipping containers filled with refrigerators
and then basically just a wall of cars
to block those bullets
Do you think all of this is enough
to stop 10000 bullets?
I think it is Jimmy
Okay but so far nothings there
You should get to building
So Blake immediately drove to three stores
where I gave him my credit card
and he literally spent 78000 on supplies
And since I dont wanna bore you with all that lets skip
to the part where everything was delivered
This first round of supplies are starting to show up
Oh my God I cant believe I bought all this stuff
And this isnt even everything man
Hes got a water truck
Some of his junk cars came in
Hes got a CONEX crate over here
How did he get this much stuff? This is crazy
Dont worry about the guys with the machine guns
Just pretend theyre not there
Yeah I dont even know what
theyre doing there honestly
Were five hours in and this storage container
is about to be the first line of defense
against 10000 bullets
Alright thats probably good Thats probably good
Do you think that shipping containers
gonna stop any bullets?
Absolutely not
So as of now hes screwed
Yeah its not looking good for him
Oh gosh
Its been about six hours Are you happy with your progress?
Im very happy  You sure?
It wasnt until this thing got down
but now that its down dude I feel really good
I asked him if this would stop the bullets
and they said no
And once Blake realized he had to go all out
he works not only through the night
This way Mr Railroad ties
Nice nice Yes
Really nice Really nice
But even into the next morning
upgrading his defense
Dude hes stuffing the storage container with a van
and a giant tube!
And once I saw it put together
I was honestly pretty impressed
Run me through what you built
So I built a whole bunch of concrete in the front
and the tallest part of the wall is right in the center
to block the crows nest machine guns
cause those things are big and scary
I got all my cars in storage containers
and a bunch of water
And if you come right over here
youll see his Lamborghini tucked away amongst everything
There it is Nice and cozy
Do you think all of this will stop the bullets?
Yeah I do
I think you have a 50 chance of survival
Thats the best odds Ive had yet
And before I have them shoot 10000 rounds
come with me to the Lamborghini
Not only are you competing for this Lamborghini
but for a hundred grand as well
What?  Yes sir
Yeah thats pretty cool huh?
This will be enough to cover the insurance
24 hours is up!
Eight scary men 10000 bullets
Versus everything that Blake has built
Are you ready?
Just get it over with Im freaking out
Were locked and loaded Ready to fire on you Jimmy
Sir fire at will  Roger that
Oh!  Oh my god!
They are unloading on his fortress
Oh my God! This is crazy!
Theyre actually ripping through
the cinder blocks now
Oh man Oh god
Oh Blakes walls are crumbling right now!
And what we havent told Blake is these guns are only
the first of four phases weve designed
to destroy this Lamborghini
or should I say whatever remains after this?
They just brought up the LMG
Oh whoa!
Oh its melting!
Cinder blocks are falling!
All it takes is one bullet to penetrate
and its going in his Lambo
Oh my God!
These are the last bullets
Ten thousand!
All clear? Lets go
Please be safe Please be safe
How is it?!
Shes clean baby!
Whoo! 10000 rounds and not one connection baby
Theres no bullet holes in your Lamborghini
And if you dont already know who Blake is
hes actually a contestant from our previous two videos
But today hes back for a third
and final attempt to win the grand prize
Are you ready for phase two?
See that giant crane coming?
That big yellow oil rig looking thing?
That is phase two
That crane is going to lift your car up a hundred feet
and then in 24 hours drop it
And you have to catch it without it being destroyed
Yeah Alright bring it over here!
And while we prepared the worlds first 100 foot
Lamborghini free fall
There goes your Lamborghini Blake!
Blake began to strategize on how he was going to catch it
I have no idea what Im gonna do
Chandler come over here
Yes Im here
How would you break its fall?
So you get all the pillows in the city
Step two get all the mattresses next get a blanket
Chandler youre just making a giant bed
Then a warm glass of milk
All right stop Youre not helping
Blake work your magic
Im screwed
Alright guys I got some good news and bad news
We passed day one with flying colors
The bad news is the Lamborghini is airborne
Okay? So anyone got any ideas?
I mean yeah hit me like what do we think?
The bouncy castles  Bouncy castles
That thats actually not that bad
Just becausethats not bad at all really
And after being inspired
by the construction workers wisdom
Blake had decided on his master plan
I would like to move the CONEXes in like a square
right here with the X in the middle
And that way I can just fill the square up with a bunch
of air mattresses pillows bubble wrap
and on top it all off with a bunch of bouncy castles
Just the biggest problem right now is I have no material
Everything that I bought is hard concrete or metal
And nothing that I bought I can use for day two
So I have absolutely nothing
And so Blake sent his crew to buy every pillow
and air mattress in the city
And even though he was incredibly sleep deprived
he got to work
Im already at the stage where its like Wait
why am I doing this again?
Oh yeah thats right Im in a challenge for a Lamborghini
thats floating in the sky right now
By the time his materials had arrived
Blake had been awake for over 24 hours
and was in desperate need of sleep
Im gonna try to get some sleep
cause Im exhausted and its four in the morning
And with how exhausted Blake was
he ended up sleeping for way longer than he planned
Is he serious?
What is this?
He got mattresses pillows and blankets
But hes missing the warm milk
Yeah thats the key to everything
Where is Blake?
Hes asleep I heard
No he is not
By the time Blake got on site
it was already super late in the day
Thats Blakes truck pulling up
Alright we need to get to work Come on!
Alright lets just see what this looks like
Oh that bouncy house works as a big box
So Im thinking maybe we put that thing in the middle now
and then we start blowing it up
Only four and a half hours remain
and its not looking good for Blake
I dont think he has more than a 10 chance
of catching a Lamborghini
And even if he does theres no shot hes stopping
that train later on
Start filling up the side so that way its high over here
takes away this wall
So with only a couple of hours remaining
Blake did all that he could by filling the rest of his pit
with cardboard boxes and bubble wrap
Its coming down to the wire
Chandler how much time is left?
One hour
Blake is screwed
I have a little bit of bubble wrap left
I think Im just gonna get raised on this thing
and just wrap my baby up in this bubble wrap
and Im good to go
Thats definitely gonna help
Blake spent what little time he had remaining
on this crane failing at trying to bubble wrap his car
Its just not gonna work
You know what time it is?
Time to drop the car Lets drop this by boy
The failed bubble wrap makes it look majestic
Blake do you think your Lamborghini will survive?
Im positive Jimmy
He is more certain than me
Im positive about this one
I bought every air mattress at Walmart
If this wont catch it I dont know what will
I did everything I can
Heres a Feastables bar Blake
Ah thank you Mr
That way even if you lose the car
at least you have some good chocolate
Its available at Walmart Be sure to go try our new bar
Im so curious what you think
But anyway you have three bouncy castles 150 mattresses
how many pillows?  150
150 pillows and 2000 cardboard boxes!
Will it break the Lamborghinis fall?
Yes Yes
Thats two yeses  Okay
24 hours of work down to this no pun intended
3 2 1 Drop the Lamborghini!
Here we go! Outta my way!
That did not sound good
Please be okay Please be okay Please be okay
Please be okay
Alright Hes moving the CONEX crate out the way
Theres no way you caught that Lambo
Get these boxes outta the way!
Whoa!  What?
Were about to find out how damaged this car is
The lights work
Ooh the lights work
Yeah This princess castle might have
saved this entire car
Moment of truth
You mightve been the first person in history
to catch a Lamborghini
If it turns on
Alright here we go Here we go Here we go
Whoa it works!
I cant believe it! Yay!
Thats what Im talking about! Shes alive!
Everything looks good minus a little crack in the bumper
which we found out via official appraiser
This was only going to reduce the price
of Blakes Lamborghini by
Probably 10 grand
Thank you so much Thanks for the good news
Right nows the perfect time to mention that Phase three
is flaming cars
For Blakes next challenge
were bringing back his biggest nightmare
We have recreated the flaming cars challenge
that costed Blake everything last time
Wow thats a low blow
But seeing that hes done this before
were gonna up the stakes by dropping twice
as many cars as last time
Ill see you tomorrow  I got a lot to prove
Redemption day!
Blake spent the rest of the night disassembling his
defense for phase two
And after a good night of sleep he was ready
to begin his defense for phase three
Its eight in the morning
Just woke up We got a lot of work to do today
So lets get started
Heres the day three plan
Im gonna cut the bottom out of a shipping container
Im gonna drop it right on the car
Next Im gonna take two more containers
and Im gonna lead them up coming
to a point right above the car
And most importantly nothing flammable this time
Do you think that will deflect a car?
Yes sir
Oh I thought you were gonna say no
Blake then asked his crew to remove every piece of wood
that was in the container
because thats what ended his challenge last time
He then had them cut out the bottom of the container
that would surround the Lamborghini
The storage container could put a lot of damage
Completely crush it?  Yeah
It can?
I mean yeah that thing weighs a whole lot
And with that being done Blake just needs
to lower the container carefully over the Lamborghini
without damaging it
One scratch can cost some thousands of dollars
Youre good just like that?
It is so close to scraping the car
Watch your fingers Were coming down!
Yes! Yes!
I cannot believe that!
Next were gonna bring these containers together
to form a V
What if the car gets caught in there?
Yeah thats that cant happen dude
Thats why were putting this pointy thing at the top
Do you think that will actually deflect our car?
A hundred percent
20 minutes remain and then we see if that Lamborghini
perishes just like his 500 grand
And as usual Blake utilized every last second
3 2 1
Not quite sure what that dirt accomplished
Time is up  No!
Lets see if unlike last time you survive phase three
you lost 500000 from this exact challenge
How are you feeling?
I feel pretty confident
I think the viewers wanna know one thing
Did you put wood inside of there like last time?
A little bit
No Im just kidding Theres no wood in there
It was one of the biggest mistakes
Ive ever made in my life
Moment of truth Come on in
Three shipping containers
A bunch of dirt concrete
a weird like pointed roof thing
Versus 10 flaming cars!
Are you ready?
Lets go dude
Light it on fire!
Will Blake be one step closer to going home
with the new Lamborghini filled
with a hundred thousand dollars or be eliminated
and go home with nothing?
Were about to find out
3 2 1
Drop it!
Oh oh!
Oh You did not want that
I feel like thats exactly what he didnt want to happen
Oh no
Still feeling good?
Not as good
Yeah this is giving me some flashbacks
Its giving you some flashbacks
Alright ready for the next one?
Lets do it Lets do it
Drop it
Oh my God the roof looks like its already buckling
And just in case Blake loses the flaming cars
like last time Im gonna take this moment
and tell you about this amazing new phone
What youre currently watching on is
the new Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra
This phone can record slowmo in 4K
The camera on this is crazy
Were like 200 feet away and its nighttime
And look at that crystal clear
Ho ho ho ho!  And go ahead and drop it
Oh that hurt to watch
It also has a ton of new features
with Galaxy AI like Photo Assist
Remember the last challenge when the bumper
got cracked on the Lambo?
You can just circle it like this
and then all you do is you hit that eraser button
And just like that the bumper is fixed
Now I have a new car
For the picture you do
Whenever youre ready
This phone also has circle to search Google
which makes finding information incredibly easy
It wouldve helped Blake a lot in the last video
to learn about the flammability of wooden railroad ties
All he needed to do was long press the home button
highlight the railroad ties and ask Is this flammable?
As you can see railroad ties are flammable
You wouldve learned the answer instantly
Could have just told you
I was genuinely impressed
by this phone and I think you will be too
So go to samsungcom click the link in the description
or scan this QR code to check it out right now
and lets drop the next car
We dropped car after car
and with each one we could tell Blake
was getting more nervous but we also noticed that all
of the impacts were starting
to damage the crate itself
Your crate on the bottom is bowing
At this point the container protecting
the Lambo was being crushed by the weight
and heat of the cars
I thought about this every day since
the last time I saw this
And now its time for the final car!
Oh no!
Bro its gotta be a thousand degrees in there!
This cars probably melting right now
We got the fire extinguisher
Somehow hes running so fast Be careful Blake
Im coming
How is it?
Its okay Its okay!
Yes! You like that?
If one more car was dropped this crate
wouldve collapsed
You stopped 10000 bullets  Easy
You caught a car out of mid air
Youve now deflected ten flaming cars
Now its time for phase four
Bring on the train
The timer has officially started
I gotta go
Good luck on phase four
God speed
What is he even running at?
Blake knew that the train was going
to be the most deadly attack yet
so he wasted no time in getting started
I think the best way to stop a train is to derail it
Thats what Ive tried to build here
All these railroad ties are tucked snug
and all of these are gonna go under the train
The trains gonna hit em like that
And if I do that a hundred more times
I dont see the train just blowing past all that
The railroad ties lost me the challenge last video
This time theyll save me
I just need two inches off the track and I win
Two inches is a lot though
My man
And then once I have all this done
I can just put concrete on top
I think thats gonna work man I think thats gonna work
Blake worked with his crew throughout
the entire night and when I showed up the next morning
it was obvious that this challenge had taken a toll on him
Whats up Jimbo?
What happened to your voice?
Im like dying out here
As you guys know he lost 250000 in this video
He lost half a million dollars in this video
I think Blake is sick and tired of losing
He has an army going super hard
Theyre currently stacking the cars
that we dropped on phase three on the train tracks
But time was still ticking down
And in order to stop this train and take his Lambo home
Blake began adding a lot more objects
to the tracks like shipping containers mattresses
to cushion the impact
Blakes worked so hard Im now on his team
And water tanks
Blake really seems to know what hes doing
Too bad theres only 11 minutes left
At this point Blake did everything he could
to finish his build before time ran out
and it was actually starting to look impressive
This is it  Three
The final stretch
Two one  Last line of defense
Times up Stop Turn it off
Turn it off
Time is officially up!
Oh my God
From phase one shipping containers phase twos
mattresses and even phase threes burning cars
Blake you somehow used all the resources
from the previous phases
Lets see if youre driving home in a Lamborghini
or if Im dropping you off at your house
Bring that train on man Bring it on
Before we ram everything we need to back the train up
Were gonna go really far back
That way the train can pick up a lot of speed
before it hits everything Sounds like a good idea?
No that sounds awful
Be honest Blake Do you think
your Lamborghini will survive?
God I hope so Jimmy
And of course we had to put the Feastables logo
on the train
Its the best chocolate on earth
Do yourself a favor and try the new formula
but for now its time for the biggest moment
of Blakes life
Lets see if he wins a Lamborghini
Blake any last words?
Give it all you got
Send the train
Here it comes
Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God
Its coming!
Its gonna speed up until it hits 35 miles an hour
right before impact
Dude it is going quick!
Its just gonna derail Its just gonna derail
Here she comes!
Lets see if it was all worth it!
Oh wait wait wait!
Blake it derailed!  Wait I think it stopped!
Oh my God!
Blake Ive never seen someone this happy!
Oh wow you derailed it!
Oh my God Oh my God I did it!
Oh my God!
This is your new Lamborghini Blake!
Not only did he win the Lamborghini
but he also got all this money!
I did it!
You wanna know the best way to end this video Blake?
By them going to Walmart and buying Feastables right now
Its the best tasty chocolate on the planet
Third times the charm See you guys later!
