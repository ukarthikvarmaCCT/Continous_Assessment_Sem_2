Hello friends!
You may not have even dreamed
that technology will reach this level
Watch this video
Can you guess which place is shown in this drone footage?
Which country is it shot in?
Whatever your guess may be
it is wrong
Because this video is neither of a real place
nor has it been taken by any drone
This is a video made by Artificial Intelligence
All these videos on the screen
all of them are fake
This man wearing a cap  or this man reading a book
these people dont exist in reality
They have been generated by the computer
Now it is almost impossible to tell the difference
between what is real
and what is computer generated
And now to make videos
you dont need a camera
You can make such videos with only a keyboard
in a matter of minutes
All of this has become possible today
because of Sora AI
A new AI platform called Sora
You cant hide from these changes
No country no economy
Sora AI is an Artificial Intelligence software
developed by OpenAI
The same company which shook the world 15 years ago
when they launched ChatGPT
In ChatGPT you have a texttotext conversation with AI
You write something in text and send it to AI
and the answer is generated in text
After this OpenAI launched the DALLE software
which was texttophoto
You wrote a text prompt
and the type of photo you wanted to generate
and you got an AIgenerated photo
And now this Sora AI is a texttovideo
Now you simply have to write in simple English
about the kind of video you want to generate
And it will do that for you
Like if you say
I want a video of a young person
who is reading a book while sitting on a cloud
Write this prompt
and in response Sora AI will  make a video like this in a few minutes
The videos I have showed you
text prompts were written to generate each of them
Some of them were generated by a long text prompt
while others had a short prompt
But Sora AI can not only generate texttovideo
but also phototovideo
This is a photo of a Shiba Inu dog
If you input this photo into Sora AI
this video is generated
Not only that it is also possible to do videotovideo
Give it the original video here
where a car is driving on the road
And if you tell it to change the environment around it
Like you want it to look like the 1920s
While keeping the car red coloured
So this video is generated from the original video
Do you understand what this technology means?
Entire industries can turn upside down
Animators Video Game Designers
Graphic Designers
what is the need for them now?
Stock photo platforms stock video platforms
will be completely destroyed
Why do you need to film for weeks for making movies
when in a few minutes AI can give you footage for the movie?
We will talk about how this will affect the world later in the video
but before that I would like to tell you
about the level of this technology  before the arrival of Sora AI
Exactly one year ago
in March 2023
this video went viral on the internet
Will Smith eating spaghetti
This video was made using AI software of another company
but a year ago this was the peak of this technology
After this some other texttovideo AI tools were released to the public
like Pika Labs and Runway
Before the arrival of Sora AI
Runway was an industry leader in this field
but look at the quality of AIgenerated videos generated by it
There is a vast difference
After Soras release
actor Will Smith was so impressed with this technology
that he made a video of himself
eating spaghetti as a joke
To show the level of technology before
and after the launch of Sora
Sora can now understand
how our world works
how motion works
according to the laws of physics
This is the reason why when the puppies are moving in this video
it knows how the snow on their heads should move
It is now able to understand emotions too
Watch this video
When this cartoon sees this candle burning
you can see the excitement play on its face
Sora is able to understand even the smallest details
like how elephants walk
the exact motion of their feet
this is why these videos look so real to us
You might be wondering about
how Sora is able to do all of it
So its basic functionality
is actually very similar to ChatGPTs
Where on one hand ChatGPT uses tokens
on the other hand Sora uses patches its equivalent
Whatever you ask ChatGPT
it divides the text in tokens
and it generates its answer through tokens
Similarly Sora AI
tries to understand photos and videos
by dividing the visual data into visual patches
And even while creating its output
it uses these visual patches to make the video
I explained this process in detail in my ChatGPT course
about what exactly are tokens
and how they work
If you have taken the course
then refer to the explanation in Chapter 23
the visual patches can be understood as an equivalent of tokens
And if you have not taken the course yet
then do check it out
because this technology is changing the world
It is disrupting industries
If you dont learn about this
if you dont use it in your daily life
you will be left behind
The first two chapters of the course are quite theoretical
in which I explain the concepts behind it
What is the technology behind ChatGPT?
How do tokens work?
What is temperature?
What is the RLHF method?
But the useful things begin in Chapter 3
These are the practical lessons
In Chapter 3 you will learn how to use it in your studies
For example if you want to go study abroad
you dont need to waste money on a consultant
Use ChatGPT
For example you can use it to practice for a job interview
Chapter 4 is focused on personal life
How can you use it in food diet planning  health and fitness and travel planning?
Chapter 5 is my favourite
It is focused on business owners and entrepreneurs
For example you can do market research  and analysis for your business
through ChatGPT
You can use it for Customer Feedback Management
Chapter 6 talks about ChatGPTs limitations
And now there is a Chapter 7 for you
Its a Bonus Content of an hourlong workshop
that I hosted in Dubais 1 Billion Summit
In this workshop I taught the attendees  how to use ChatGPTs full potential
But not only this
in April 2024
I will add another major update to this course
There will be new chapters and new lessons
because this technology is changing so fast
and if you buy this course once
all future updates are free for you

Now if lets get back to Sora
at the first glance you will definitely feel that
this technology has reached perfection
But if you look at it closely
you will see that it is not 100 perfect yet
No doubt this is a great technology
it is absolutely unbeatable
but not yet 100 perfect
Why am I saying this?
Because in the videos I showed you
look at them carefully
The man who is reading the book
look at how the wind is moving  the pages of this book in the wrong direction
The astronaut thats walking
look at how his walking speed increases suddenly
Open AI openly acknowledges the  weaknesses of Sora AI on its website
These AIgenerated videos
sometimes fail to apply the physics of the real world
Like this basketball
which is passing through the hoop
Or the three hands seen in this video
Or this video of a grandma celebrating her birthday
it may seem like everything is fine first
but look at it carefully
How are the people reacting?
Look at it more carefully
Did you find the mistake?
Then look more carefully
The way people are waving their hands in the background
No normal person waves their hand like this
So today these are the minor details
based on which it is possible to detect
if a video is AIgenerated
or a video taken in real life
But the speed with which this technology is improving
I dont think that one year later
it would be possible to detect this anymore
And the people in OpenAI know this
the day these videos become so real that
no human eye will be able to differentiate between these
that day huge problems will be created
Fake news would be spread so easily
Perhaps this is the reason why Sora AI
is not released to the public yet
It is being tested by Red Teamers for security concerns
This means that it is in the testing phase
Red Teamers refers to those people from Cyber Security
who behave like attackers
Their job is to find the systems weaknesses
But even when it would be released to the public
I dont think it would be possible to  manipulate photos and videos of any real person
because that will always be a major security risk
of people using it
to make fake videos of any politician
and that could cause election interference
But this is a thing that is becoming a  big problem even before Sora is released
Watch this video
This is a video of Virat Kohli in which
he is promoting a betting app
is a type of game
which can be called an investmentworthy app
Or I can call it an investmentworthy game
In which you can spend a little money
to get maximum winnings
Could you recognise that this wasnt a real video?
This is a 100 AIgenerated video
Some fraud companies have already started exploiting this
Celebrities faces are used to run these ads on social media
People are lured with money
and told to download their app
The same thing happened to Sachin Tendulkar
My daughter is playing this game now
everyone is talking about it
She plays games on the  app
and earns 180000 every day
Another completely fake video
but did you see that
the technology has reached the level where
it is possible to use someone elses voice
For now there is only one way to avoid such videos
watching these videos carefully
You will always find small mistakes
Somewhere the lip movement will be strange
The quality of such videos will be low
If you try to listen to the voice carefully
you will find that
the voice is not like the original
It seems like an artificially synthesised voice
Listen to Sachin Tendulkars voice again
My daughter is playing this game now
and everyone is talking about it
You can differentiate by noticing the small details
but most importantly
look at the video content
What is being promoted in the video?
What are you being told to do?
This application is absolutely free
any iPhone owner can download it
The plane flies at 2X 3X 4X 5X etc
If a celebrity tells you to download any app
where you can make 10 times the money you spend on it
this should alert you
Whether it is an AI video or a real video
you should stay away from such things
Apart from this a technological solution  can also be created for these problems
An AI whose job is to
identify AIgenerated videos
OpenAI has said that the videos generated by SoraAI
would have a watermark on them
With that watermark you can always identify whether
a video is AIgenerated or not
Personally I use AIgenerated photos or videos often in my videos
In such cases in the top right corner of the video I always write
You must have seen this written  in the corner of my videos often
This is so that you can understand
that the photo or video on the screen
is not real it is AIgenerated
But an even bigger issue is the jobs
What will be the impact of this AI  on industries and economies globally?
Even in films filmmakers will not have to  carry big cameras and film in different places
In a few years entire films can be made using AI
Last year the director of the Avengers films  Joe Russo famously said that
it will take only 2 years
for AI to reach the level where
it can start producing entire films
Similarly it will have a huge impact on the gaming industry
The video games that took years to make
needed teams of more than 100 people
How easily the same tasks can be done with this
According to this NBC article
filmmaker Tyler Perry was going to spend 800 million
to expand his studio
But as soon as Sora was released
he stopped his studio expansion
After all what is the need for a studio
if AI makes videos for us?
This means that many jobs across different industries
are at risk of being eliminated
The cinematographer who needed many days  to make 2minute long stock footage
and earned money by selling them
or the VFX artist
who made the NPCs for major gaming companies
In the short term the jobs related to film  and video production advertising and marketing
will be affected the most
But at the same time there is a positive side to it
The good thing will be that
we will see democratisation in all these fields
These fields will become more accessible to the common people
If your dream was to become a film producer
but you didnt have the money or the equipment
now you will get the opportunity to show your creativity through Sora AI
without these resources
Now even an IT employee will get the  opportunity to become a good filmmaker
and a musician will get the opportunity to  make music videos without spending a lot
Looking at such technologies
it is understandable to be a little scared of them
Do you know friends that 600 years ago
when the printing press was invented
many religious leaders were opposing it
Some people used to say that
the books are actually given to us by the devil
That books should be banned
In 1501 the Pope  Pope Alexander VI
said that without the permission of the Church
no onw was allowed to print books
One thing is clear here
whether you like this technology or not
it cannot be ignored
All people and all governments
have to learn to adapt to this new world
Many governments around the world  have already started taking proactive steps
Like in Singapores Parliament
recently one of their MPs
gave this speech on Sora AI a few days ago
The politicians name is Tan Wu Meng
He said that the Singapore government
has now launched a new subsidy  to adapt to the new AI developments
This subsidy is for people above 40 years of age
so that they can pursue a fulltime diploma once again
Because their government has understood that
today if you study something in a college or university
whatever you are being taught today
will it still be relevant 20 years later  after technology transforms so drastically?
So it is better to tell people to  educate themselves again after 40 years
To be able to adapt to the new developments
by upskilling themselves
Interestingly the government of Singapore
had started talking about AI in 2019
And in the latest budget for 2024
they have pledged to invest 1 billion in AI
In the National AI Strategy 20
I will invest more than 1 Billion over the next 5 years
into AI computing talent and industry development
So this will be my suggestion to you
The sooner you learn to adapt to this changing world
the more benefits will you reap
But I would like to say one more thing about AI
since AI has become a very trendy word nowadays
many companies are exploiting it
and there are many useless AIs present in the market today
When I made my first video on AI
at the beginning of that video I showed you many things
that could be done through AI
Like changing your face
changing your voice
And if I want
I can also change my voice with the help of AI
But after taking my course  many of you gave me the feedback
asking me why I made a course only on ChatGPT
Why didnt I talk about the other AIs in the course?
This is why
Most of the other AIs are just for vanity
They have no practical use in life
Like during the face swap
when I changed my face to Tom Cruises and Hrithik Roshans
I used a tool called Akool Face Swap
It was an expensive tool
I had spent a lot of money just to get  the output of a few seconds of footage
The result was not that good either
because you could clearly look at me and say that
the face looks manipulated
it doesnt look real
And there were no other features in it
Thats why such AI tools are called Gimmicks
They are used only for showoff
But these wont help you in your studies
nor will it improve your efficiency
and nor will it help you with your business
Thats why I focused the most on ChatGPT
Because ChatGPT is actually lifechanging
ChatGPT can be used practically in many aspects of our lives
Thats why the entire course focuses on it
And recently many Indian AI companies have popped up
claiming to have made the first Indian AI
that is later found to be
using ChatGPT in the base at the back end
Apart from ChatGPT  Midjourney DALLE and Stable Diffusion
are the three texttophoto AI software
that are actually useful
And I think in the near future
Sora AI will be as revolutionary
as ChatGPT was
So if you want me to make a video
giving the overview of all these AI tools
then you can let me know in the comments below
And for now the link to download the course
will be in the description below with the coupon code
