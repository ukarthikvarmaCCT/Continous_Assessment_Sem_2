Hello friends!
On 8th August 1942
in the Gwalior Tank Maidan Mumbai
the leaders of the All India Congress Committee gathered
They were about to announce a movement
A final struggle against the British  imperialist government in power
In front of thousands of people
Mahatma Gandhi gave a historic speech
Every one of you should consider yourself free
We can no longer live under the shoes of imperialism
We need complete freedom
I give you a mantra
You may imprint it on your hearts
and let every breath of yours give expression to it
This mantra is Do or Die
Do or Die
Either we will see India free
or we will be k!ll3d in this attempt
But we shall not live in this slavery anymore
Long live Mother India!
Well succeed or d!e trying!
Well succeed or d!e trying!
Friends this was the beginning of
the Quit India Movement
Quit India Movement
The British government was aware of it
Since a few months prior to this the  Home Department of the British government
was working on a 3stage plan to end this movement
Stage 1 Use of Propaganda
Controlling the media in such a way that
no newspaper could publish this news
Stage 2 Raiding the offices of Congress organizations
seizing their funds
and arresting all the leaders of Congress
Stage 3 was to suppress the mass movement
using emergency powers
declaring the Congress leaders as antinational
and thus ending the movement  before it even began
The next day 9th August
Mahatma Gandhi Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Maulana Azad
and all the top leaders of Congress
were arrested and put in jail
These leaders were not to be  released from jail for many years
Then the question was  how to further this movement?
In todays video you will hear  a great story of inspiration
Amidst so much oppression and difficulties
How does the slogan of revolution
reach every corner of the country?
And who were those traitors living in the country
who were on the side of the British  during this movement?
Lets understand the Quit India Movement in depth
in todays video
It was exactly 2 years before this movement started
8th August 1940
British Raj had presented an offer to Indian  freedom fighters through Viceroy Linlithgow
It was called the August Offer
In this he said that the Indian  representation would be increased
in the BritishIndian government
Actually this was the time
when World War II was in full rage in Europe
Germanys dictator Adolf Hitler
was successfully invading one country after another
and Britain was the only country standing against him
The British government in the UK
was in big trouble and was desperate
to get help from wherever it could
Although Indian soldiers were already  fighting on behalf of the British in World War II
the British wanted more cooperation from the Indians
So they decided to send in an offer to convince the Indians
Till this time Congress had decided that
they would not accept inconsequential offers
They wanted complete freedom
They said that if the British government wanted
India to cooperate with them in WWII
then they would have to give  complete independence to India
So this August Offer was a failure
After this in March 1942
another delegation was sent by Britain
It was called the Cripps Mission because
the leader of the House of Commons  at that time was Stafford Cripps
The missions aim was
to give India independence  after the end of World War II
but the offer given by the British in the Cripps Mission
was not of full freedom
but of Dominion status
As per the Cripps Offer  India would be an autonomous region
under the British Commonwealth
This was a better offer than the previous one
but Congress outrightly rejected it
They clearly stated their goal
complete freedom
By then Congress leaders were  fed up with these offers and negotiations
A few months later on 14th July 1942
in the Wardha Committee
a resolution was passed to  start a civil disobedience movement
Many prominent leaders of the time like
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rajendra Prasad
and Jayaprakash Narayan showed great interest
in this initiative
9 days after the meeting on 23rd July
Secretary of State for India Lord Amery
wrote a letter to the Secretary of State  for the Colonies Viscount Cranborne
He stated that the resolution  passed at the Wardha meeting
would be approved on 7th August in the  All India Congress Committee meeting
After this a mass movement would begin
which would be a direct challenge to the British Empire
He stated that they should  take strict measures to prevent it
He wrote in the letter
If necessary we have to contemplate
therefore the probable arrest of Gandhi
and of the members of the Working Committee
It is also mentioned that
some of the Congress leaders  should be deported to Africa
so that this movement could not begin
The next day the British Rajs Home Department
shared a threestage plan with Amery
to stifle this movement
The same plan that I mentioned at the beginning of the video
This is the reason why when the  All India Committee passed the Quit India Resolution
the British already knew about it
After Mahatma Gandhis historic speech
on 9th August at around 5 in the morning
Gandhi and the other top leaders were arrested
After the arrest Mahatma Gandhi  was taken to the Aga Khan Palace in Pune
The British had a strategic reason for this
Viceroy Linlithgow wrote to Amery saying that
they should send the Mahatma to a place
that doesnt have the word Jail in its name
If the people were to find out that he was put into a jail
it might infuriate the masses
So they decided to pretend that Gandhi  was placed under housearrest in a Palace
We may be quite certain
that we shall have some  uphill propaganda battles to fight
After these arrests the Congress party was banned
All the offices of Congress across the country
were sealed and declared antinational
Two other influential organizations of that time
the Muslim League and Hindu Mahasabha
didnt face any restrictions
Because both these organizations
were not supporting the Quit India Movement
I will discuss this in detail later in the video
but before that lets see the medias reaction
Not a single word of Gandhis historic speech  was allowed to be printed in the newspapers
So neither did any newspaper publish  Mahatma Gandhis speech
nor did they talk about the British governments action
How could one convey Gandhis message to the people?
Friends at this point in our story enters
22yearold activist Usha Mehta
Along with some of her colleagues
she found a transmitter and  started an underground radio station
Congress Radio 4234 thus began
It was on 14th August when this  underground radio station began transmitting
And the words you just heard  were spoken by none other than Usha Mehta
Through this radio the messages of  the All India Congress Committee
were broadcast to every corner of the country
Such underground media channels started  opposing the propaganda of the British Raj
To keep their location hidden
in her messages Usha Mehta used to say
This is Congress Radio  from somewhere in India
But actually she was operating from Bombay
It took the British government about 3 months  to find the source of this radio
But by then a lot of people were already aware
Gradually All India Radio was called AntiIndia Radio
when they tried to jam the Congress radio
Finally on 12th November 1942
the British government arrested Usha Mehta
All her equipment was seized
and despite interrogating her for 6 months
she does not reveal anything to the British
Later in 1969
when she was interviewed she said
When the press is gagged and all news banned
a transmitter certainly helps a good deal
in furnishing the public withspreading the message of rebellion in the remotest corners of the country
When this movement began Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose
was living in Berlin Germany
And he was trying his best
to raise awareness through his Azad Hind Radio
As soon as the news of the  Quit India Movement reached Netaji
he told his friend ACN Nambiar
it was time to support Gandhi
Although there was a lot of difference in  the methods of Netaji and Gandhi ji
Netaji was completely in favour  of the Quit India Movement
He called this movement  Indias NonViolent Guerrilla Warfare
On one hand our freedom fighters were  trying to raise awareness among the masses
on the other hand some new faces emerged
who were ready to protest on the ground
A few words from Mahatma Gandhi  inspired people to such an extent that
its beyond our imagination
Matangiri Hazra was a 72yearold woman who lived in the Bengal Presidency
She is known as Gandhi Buri in Bengali
which means old femaleGandhi
On 29 September 1942
she led a rally of 6000 people in her district
Her plan was to hoist the flag at  the Tamluk police station nearby
and to capture the police station
She was more courageous than her age
Despite the police threats she did not stop
Vande Mataram!
She was leading this rally from the front
chanting Vande Mataram
when she was shot thrice
Even after she was shot
she didnt stop chanting Vande Mataram
Eventually she fell down holding the Tiranga in her hand
After 30 years of independence in 1977
Hazra became the first woman revolutionary
whose statue was erected in Kolkata Maidan
Thousands of people like Hazra
were open fired at by the British in an effort to suppress this movement
Ram Manohar Lohia wrote a letter  to the then Vice Royal Linlithgow
in which he stated that
more than 50000 revolutionaries were k!ll3d
during this Quit India Movement
Apart from this more than 100000 arrests were made
These include many names  that might not have never heard of
Like Sucheta Kripalani
who later became the 4th Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
She led her own underground movement
Some leaders were ready to be arrested
and they had already made alternate plans
For example when Yusuf Meher Ali  was arrested on 9th August
he had already told his friends
that it was their responsibility to  continue the movement further
One of them was Aruna Asaf Ali
who led the first demonstration of  the Quit India Movement on 9th August
in Gwalior Tank Maidan
She was later called the Grand Old Lady  of the Independence Movement
She was the first mayor of Delhi
and in 1997 she was awarded Bharat Ratna
During the movement Aruna Asaf Ali  was saved from being arrest
by being underground
On the other hand there were some leaders
who were jailed but when they came out they continued their work
Like Jai Prakash Narayan
who was put in Hazaribagh Central Jail
and together with his friends he made a plan to escape from the jail
On the night of Diwali 8th November 1942
when most of the guards were not on duty
they successfully carried out a historic jail break
He escaped from the jail with 7 other prisoners
and fled to Nepal where
he started the Azad Dastan
There are many more such stories from all over the country
where during the Quit India Movement not only the leaders
but even the common people were  doing their best to take part in the protest
From collecting school fees by the students
to blocking the railway tracks by the villagers
no stones were left unturned
The British governments police station courts
post offices and other symbols of the government authorities
were attacked
In colleges the students went on strike
and marches were organised
In Bombay Jamshedpur and Ahmedabad
factory workers did not go to work for weeks
This is also something to note
Not everyone needs to take out rallies  to participate in the movement
Stopping your work going on organized strikes
is also a way to participate in the movement
In some places there was violence too
Bridges were blown up  telegraph wires were cut
and railway lines were blocked
In places like UP and Bihar at that time
there were slogans to set police stations on fire
On 31st August Viceroy Linlithgaon wrote  a letter to Winston Churchill stating that
I am engaged here in the meeting by far
the most serious rebellion since that of 1857
He acknowledged that the revolution he was dealing with
was so big that
the last comparable revolution was in 1857
All the strategies of the British government failed here
Despite arresting all the top leaders
this movement was moving ahead rapidly because
the common people were participating in this
How many people could you shoot?
How many could you put in jail?
By then violence was already on the rise
It is also very interesting to note what
Mahatma Gandhi thought about this violence
We know that in 1922
when violence was seen in the noncooperation movement
he stopped that movement
Once again in 1934 during the Civil Disobedience Movement
when violence began
Gandhi ji stopped that movement
But now during the Quit India Movement
when violent incidents were again seen
Gandhi ji was already tired
On 7th June 1942 he wrote in his weekly magazine Harijan
I waited and waited
until the countrydeveloped nonviolent strength
necessary to throw off the foreign yoke
I feel that I cannot afford to wait
If inspite of all precautions
rioting takes place
it cannot be helped
Gandhi jis approach this time was pragmatic
considering this complex situation
He blamed all this violence on the British government
Here if you want to understand  Mahatma Gandhis ideology in depth
then I would like to recommend his autobiography

Now lets get back to the topic
In this entire struggle many people  didnt participate in this movement
Which is understandable
Not everyone dares to raise their  voice against the people in power
But there were some people who
were bootlicking the British so much that
they were supporting the British  in ending the Quit India Movement
There were two major organizations at that time
Muslim League and Hindu Mahasabha
The Muslim League passed a resolution in 1940
which is known as the Lahore Resolution
Because of this they demanded
that a separate country be created for Muslims
It is also called the Pakistan Resolution
At that time there was a Muslim League leader Fazlul Huq
he was the first Prime Minister of Bengal Province
Their government in Bengal was formed  with an alliance with the Hindu Mahasabha
In this Muslim League government
Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the Finance Minister
It was on 26 July 1942
about two weeks before the start of the Quit India Movement
Syama Prasad Mukherjee wrote a letter to the British government
Anybody who during the war
plans to stir up mass feelings
resulting in internal disturbances or insecurity
must be resisted by the government
Further he asked about how the Quit India  Movement could be combated in Bengal
He states that the administration should be such that
all efforts by the Congress would fail
And the movement would not begin in the Bengal Province
He was literally discussing ideas with the British government
on how to suppress this movement
During the 24th session of the Hindu Mahasabha in Kanpur
their party leader Vinayak Damodar Savarkar
came up with another strategy
The Hindu Mahasabha follows  the strategy of responsive cooperation
Not only did they intend to give  unconditional cooperation to the British government
they were also ready for active and armed resistance
At that time the Hindu Mahasabha was a political party
and at the organizational level
RSS had the same response towards the Quit India Movement
Thats why the British intelligence agencies
described their stance as follows
The Sangh has scrupulously kept itself within the law
andrefrained from taking part in the  disturbances that broke out in August 1942
While on one hand Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose formed the Azad Hind Fauj
a few months after the Quit India Movement
On the other hand Savarkar was helping the colonial government
recruit hundreds of thousands of Indians
in the British Armed Forces
These Indians joined the British Army
and fought against Subhash Chandra Boses Azad Hind Fauj
At that time there was a man named Narayan Apte
who joined the British Army
and later on became a recruiter for  the British Royal Indian Air Force
Later on he was found guilty
for being involved in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi
Along with that Nathuram Godses  brother Gopal Godse
was also fighting this war on the British side
Savarkar had said some more things  about the Quit India Movement
That this type of unscrupulous rebellion
did not deserve any sympathy
This was a huge insult to the freedom fighters
who were actually fighting  against the British at that time
And that is why after hearing this Netaji  Subhash Chandra Bose could not remain silent
On 14th August 1942
in Berlin he sent a message through the radio
I would request Mr Jinnah Mr Savarkar and all those leaders
who still think of a compromise with the British
to realise that in the world of tomorrow  there will be no British Empire
A senior leader of Hindu Mahasabha NC Chatterjee wrote
It is rather amusing to find
that Mr Jinnah wants
the Muslims to not join the Congress movement
and Mr Savarkar wants
Hindus not to join the same
Despite all this opposition friends
the Quit India Movement was successful
The world started talking about Indias freedom
The then American President Roosevelt  also put pressure on the UK government
to fulfil some of Indias demands
Even in Britain the British people were  demanding that India be given freedom
In June 1945 the British Labour Party  released its new manifesto
Let Us Face The Future
They made a promise to the British people
that if they came into power
then they would give complete freedom to colonies like India
Next month in 1945 the Labour Party came to power in Britain
and the new Prime Minister was Clement Attlee
And he openly declared that
it was time to give India selfgovernance
As soon as the government changed in Britain
the arrested Congress leaders  were released from jail in India
And two years after that the struggle that  our Indian freedom fighters started years ago
became successful
India got complete freedom
Although it was clear by 1945 that
Indias freedom was inevitable
in 1946 two other important things happened
which increased the importance of freedom
First the INA soldiers courtmartial
also known as the INA trials
and second the Royal Indian Navy Mutiny
Lets talk about these in detail in another video
For now if you liked this video

in which I have explained in detail
why Indias partition happened

that led to the partition?
