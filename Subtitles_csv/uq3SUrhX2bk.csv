I was watching a Stand up Comedy video on youtube recently
And then I saw a comment on the video By a handle named feministboymanoj
And  the comment read
What is this habit of Stand Up Comedians using abusive words to get laughter?
Act responsible guys Remember
women are also watching these videos
And I also saw a reply to the comment By a handle named lalitha19111954
And the reply read Chup Kar Madarchod
Best thing I have seen on the internet so far
Also I perform in English I dont perform in Hindi
Because I am not a Star Plus kind of a guy
I am more of a Sun TV kind of a guy
Thats what I am One guy continues laughing thinking about Suryavamsam movie
Do you watch it a lot sir?
I come from this small town in Tamil Nadu Called Chennai if you guys know about it
Thats the problem whenever I come out of Chennai
A lot of people think I am a moron
So I always tell them No I am an oxymoron
Because I am a Tamilian who can speak Hindi
But when I say I know Hindi I know Hindi better than most Tamilians do
So I am the kind of guy who goes into a Punjabi Dhaba
And says Agali order Chaar roti chahiye Mostly in Amitabh Bhachans tone
Because Kaun Banega Crorepati is the only Hindi show I ever watched in my life
When I need six rotis I can be Bhaiya che roti chahiye
My problem really is when I need twelve rotis Because that is when I have to say
Bhaiyaaa Ek dho roti chahiye
Audience laughing longer than he expected Okay relax
Audience laughing more See you cannot blame me because
That is how the railway station ladies taught me Hindi
For some reason it is always Agali gaadi number DhoShoonyaEkChaar aa gaya hai
That too with an orgasm every time she says it
Doing poor orgasmic impression of the same numbers
Why cant they just fucking call it Dho hazaar
You Hindi speaking people in the house Have you ever used the word Shoonya
in any of your day to day conversations? No right? It is not just with Hindi
Even when a Tamilian says his phone number in Tamil
It is always like OnbadhuEzhuEttuZEROnaalumoonuZERO
Just because we Indian invented zero
it   become an official word in every damn Indian language
The funniest thing is for a very long time I thought the phrase Ugly gaadi meant
the train is going to be very dirty
Which is apparently always true right?
I thought it was a disclaimer from the Railways department
Saying Our trains are fking ugly please dont enter it
Hindi is one language which always embarrasses me man
I used to work for this company called Amazon And before you guys get any judgemental
I used to work as a Software Engineer there I have to tell this because the last time
I told a lady I work for Amazon She was like Ooooohhhhhhhhhhhh!
Which area do you take care of?
Happens when you look like a real estate agent
I used to go to office in my office cab regularly And one fine day a pretty North Indian lady
was sitting next to me And like an ass I wanted to impress her with
my Hindi So I spoke to the cab waala saying
Bhaiya seedha chalthe signal ke aage left se rukho
And for some reason she smiled at me and said No language would help you bro just shut up!
It is not like I dont try to learn the
language of Hindi That is why most of the times I go to my Hindi
speaking colleagues And try to create small talks with them
Like asking them Kya bhai Kaisa hey aap But as a Tamilian I expect them to understand me
and come up with simple replies Like Acha hai
Bahuth acha hai
Or if they are not so happy they can say
Acha nahi hai But that is when this guy wants to mess up
with me Comes up with big ass dialogues like
Ek gaav mein ek kisaan rakuthatha ki Kabhi Kushi kabhi gam khi Saala kaadoos ki
Ache din aane waale hai
And then I have to go Acha hai
And then I just walk away But most times deep inside I am like Ommaley
Not even staying there
With this level of Hindi I had the audacity to Gurgaon
I was hungry I went to this food centre called Haldirams
It was a self service counter so I got my food coupon
And then I gave my token to the food counter And I was waiting for my turn to be called
And then I realised that these guys were shouting out token numbers in Hindi
And my token number was Eight hundred and Eighty eight
Immediately I was like I am going to starve tonight Let me be ready
But I didnt want to give up So I took
out my google translator And typed 888 in numbers and then I
said Translate to Hindi And google said 888in numbers
I was like Google is stupid man So I tried to be specific
I typed Eight hundred and eighty eight in English
And translated it and google said Aat sau assi aat
For the next five minutes my goal was to remember it
So I started reciting Aat sau assi aatAat sau assi aat Aat sau assi aat
The guys was like Aat sau pachpan I was like NO Aat sau assi aatAat sau
assi aat Aat sau The guy was like Aat sau Athiban
I was like NO Aat sau assi aatAat sau assi aat Aat sau
Athiban is not a number it is just my friends name
Five minutes later my turn came out and the guy shouted
Token number Aataataat
These railway station ladies man I hate them!
I like talking about languages Because language is one thing that unites us
at the same time divides us
I know this because I am a Tamilian who lives in Bangalore
And my roommate in Bangalore is a Kannadiga
from Karnataka Sometimes he tells me
Navin you are in Karnataka you should learn Kannada
Which I completely empathise with That is why I always tell him
Dude I will definitely learn Kannada once I am done with Java and Python
Because if I am not going to learn Java and Python
I am not going to be in the Silicon Valley of India to learn Kannada in the first place right?
But this is why I like South Indian metropolitan cities in general
Because people from different parts of the country come and live here
Be it Bombay or Bangalore
Sometimes even people from outside the country live here
I think that is why there are very less road rages in these cities
Because most of the time if you have to fight with another person on the streets
The common language is English And we Indians are good at a lot of things
Fighting in English is not one among them That is why the maximum quarrel you can see
in English is One guy saying Fuck you
And another guy saying You fuck you
And then both of them fuck off That is the end of the quarrel nobody gets hurt
I have been in fights I have never been like
Hey I am going to kill you carve your chest up with a knife use your skin as furniture
covers make a necklace out of both of your ears and screw your skull through one your eyeballs
Thanks for laughing at that man
It took me three weeks to by heart that one dialogue
Had to download the script of Django Unchained
Sometimes even NRIs who come back from
UK and western countries Even they cant fight in English
Firstly I dont know why they have this American dream a lot of people go to the
US Because I recently went to the US to realise
that there is not much difference between India and these western countries
Except this one thing called the usage of toilet paper
And when I went there I had no difficulty on how to use a toilet paper
Thanks to all the YouTube videos I watched
Thats how you learn things in the internet era I am sorry
But once I was done with all the basic etiquettes
My real confusion was whether to throw the used paper
Into the dustbin or into the toilet commode Because think about it traditionally in India
all the waste paper goes to the dustbin And all the shit goes to the toilet commode
And this thing in my hand is a very weird combination
That is why most of the times I was there I just dropped it on the floor and just ran
away I was just clever I didnt use the same
loo twice on the same day
I also met a friend there a school friend of mine
who has been living there for three years
And he consistently had this fake accent like how people have it
At one point I got really annoyed So I slapped him and said Dude Talk properly
And he shouted OMG! Did you just slap me?
And that is when I realised he was desperately trying to be an American
Because only Americans can do that shit Getting slapped by a person and asking the
same person Did you just slap me?
Any Indians response to a slap is a slap back or a swear word
But this guys response was a rhetorical question
I became angry I slapped him again
And this time he started sounding like an African dude
Yo man please dont hit me like that!In poor African accent
So I slapped him again And then he started sounding like a Sheikh
from Saudi Arabia And that is when I realised that with every slap
This guy is actually coming back to his home country
One slap at a time
The last time I slapped him so hard He became so Indian that he started chasing
me shouting Lavadekebal And then I had to run for my life
But I was talking about road rages Because I recently got into a road rage in
Bangalore I was on my bike and I dashed into this car
And I immediately realised it was my mistake So I was ready to apologise to this guy
So I came out my bike And this guy came out of his car
The problem is even before starting to listen to me
He started shouting at me in Hindi And I was like If you are going to shout
at me in your mother tongue I am going to shout at you in my mother tongue
And I started shouting at him in Tamil Which went on for the next two minutes
After which both of us realised This is not helping either of us
Why are we even doing this? He also probably realised it
So he was like Dude can we fight in English? Because I dont know Kannada
I understand The South Indian in me got furious
I wanted to tell him Dude this is not Kannada this is Tamil
These are very different South Indian languages But the Bangalorean in me told him something
That I always wanted to tell people in Bangalore So I looked at his straight into his eyes
I told him This is Karnataka you should learn Kannada
He was like Sure Thank you man and got into the car
Alright guys thats been my time you guys have been a fantastic audience Thanks for listening!
