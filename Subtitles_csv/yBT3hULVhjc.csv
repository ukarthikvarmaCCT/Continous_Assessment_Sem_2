Hello friends!
About 60 or 70 years ago
when people were asked
to imagine how the year 2020 would look
people imagined futuristic looking cities
Cars flying in the sky
Flying cars would have become a reality
But unfortunately it didnt happen
The reality looks like this today
While people imagine the year 2020 to look like this
But do you know what friends?
Flying cars are something
thats slowly becoming a reality
Today in 2022
a company in Slovakia
has successfully tested an actual flying car
This isnt a dream for the future
it is the reality now
Come lets understand this technology in todays video
If you havent noticed lately
were living in the future
But theres still one thing thats conspicuously absent
Where are the flying cars?
I was promised flying cars
I dont see any flying cars
Would there ever be an aircraft
where you can just jump in
and be able to take off and fly where ever you want to?
Listening to it friends it feels like
a flying car is something really futuristic
but people had started trying to make one about 100 years ago
The year 1917
saw the first attempt at building a flying car
Or perhaps a roadable aeroplane
An aeroplane that can navigate roads too
It was named the Autoplane
This was built by Glenn Curtis
It was given the title Limousine of the Year
But was this flying car actually able to fly?
Its said that when they tried to fly it
it lifted off the ground
but unfortunately it couldnt fly properly
So the Autoplane turned out to be a failure
After this we get to 1933
when the US Air Commerce Bureau conducted a competition
called the Flivver Competition
They challenged people to design an aeroplane
that would cost less than 700 to build
Many models were submitted in this competition
and one of these models was of the Aerobile
Designed by Walda Waterman
This was an aeroplane that looked like a car
It could take flight
but never went into production
because they were going through the Great Depression
There were enough funds to produce it
But what could be called the first successful attempt
took place in 1945
American inventor Robert Edison Fulton
built an aeroplane called the Airphibian
It looked like a proper aeroplane
the only difference was that the front of it could be detached
It took about 5 minutes to convert this aeroplane into a car
And the resulting car looked like the front of the aeroplane
For its era this Airphibian was quite innovative
and it got a flight certification from the Civil Aviation Authority
But the problem was that
because of the compromises in the design
it was neither a good aeroplane
that could compete with the other aeroplanes
Nor was it a good car
that could compete with the other cars
When it turned into a car it looked really weird
To add to it in 1945 there were financial problems due to World War II
This company could not find investors for this flying car
And then came the Convaircar
Industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss attempted this in 1947
This looked like a car stuck with an aeroplane on it
Airphibian looked like an aeroplane completely
But this looked as if
the car got stuck to the aeroplane by mistake
and is now flying with it
It too took 5 minutes to convert from an aeroplane to a car
And by converting it meant
detaching the aeroplane part and keeping it aside
And then it could be used as a car
It was a great idea for its time
And in its third test flight
this Convaircar crashed
The pilot checked the reading on the meter
and thought that there was enough fuel and that he could continue flying
and though the car did have enough fuel
there was very little in the aeroplanes tank
It led to this unfortunate crash
After this crash people lost confidence in it
And the investors backed out
The problem with these attempts was that
they took a car and they took an aeroplane
and they tried to combine them as they were
A true flying car would be one
that could actually transform from an aeroplane to a car
The two cant simply be combined
merely to detach the part of the aeroplane when the car is used
Morton Taylor was the first person
to decide to work on the design of Airphibian
and to make the wings of the Airphibian foldable
So that when it has to be used as a car
the wings can be folded
and stored behind the car
This came true in the year 1949
It was named Taylors Aerocar
They got the certification
the approval for mass production
but the problem was that
they needed at least 500 advance orders
before mass production could begin
But there werent enough people interested in it
So they couldnt get the orders
So the deal had to be cancelled
At one point the company Ford was quite close
to buying this Taylor Aerocar
But that deal couldnt be finalised either
There was a scarcity of funds
but perhaps a bigger problem was
the lack of technological advancement
We didnt have the technology
to build a true flying car
But today
neither do we lack funds
and the technology has moved by leaps and bounds since the 1950s
So the recent attempts at building a flying car
have been amazing
They are truly futuristic
In October 2021
a Swedish company called Jetson Aero
presented their Jetson 1 Airplane to the world
As you can see
it doesnt look like a car at all
rather it can be called an extralarge drone
Because it flies just like a drone
A person sits inside it and pilots it around
It is a singleseater vehicle
Only one person can sit inside it
They had started working on it in 2017
The first prototype was ready in January 2018
and it had its first successful flight too
But they introduced their company
and presented their 2nd generation prototype to the world
In October 2021
Its speciality is its design
A helicopter needs a helipad to take off
but this is so compact
so small that it can land on your roof
and take off from your neighbourhood garden as well
To keep it lightweight
its frame is made of aluminium
And it weighs only 86kg
It is very light
And the person sitting in it
can weigh up to 95kg
Perhaps the most interesting thing is that
you wouldnt need a pilots license to fly it
Because according to the US Laws
there is no need for a pilots license
for a homebuilt singleseater aircraft
Since it is a singleseater aircraft
only one person can sit in it
and its homebuilt too
because if you buy it
itll reach you 50 assembled
You can order it from anywhere in the world
the way that the company ships this to you
you need to assemble it yourself
So it comes under the category homebuilt
With this the legal hassles for the company reduce
Because the company would no longer be responsible in case of accidents
Because you have put it together
Jetson 1 is truly very futuristic
but it cannot be practically used much
Because you cant fly it at night
You cant fly it over city traffic
Because these are restricted airspace
And generally
it is quite difficult to fly a camera drone nowadays
it will be very difficult to get permission to fly this
But their cofounder Peter Ternstrom has said that
they arent trying to solve a problem in the world
they are simply promoting it as a fun activity
He claims that it is fun to fly it
You can guess the origins of the name of the company Jetson
If you recall The Jetsons used to be a cartoon show a while ago
And the futuristic aircraft used by the Jetsons to travel
looked somewhat like this
So they tried to copy that design
and took inspiration from it
So this Jetson 1 cannot be termed as a proper flying car
Because it can run on the roads
But theres another company in Slovakia
They presented their Aircar to the world last month
It is a flying car in true essence
Friends it is very clear
that to build such technology
we need skilful engineers and out of the world innovation
Unfortunately innovative things of this level
can be rarely seen in countries like India
A huge reason for this is that
there are many engineers with degrees in India
but they lack the skills that are actually needed to do a job properly
More than 90 of the engineers in India
arent employable due to this
Thankfully there are some companies
that are helping software engineers to become more skilled
Like Scalercom
Scalercom is a tech school
where the subject matter experts from the top tech companies teach students
They share their industry experience with the learners
They focus on college students and working professionals
so that they can be upskilled
Especially with their oneonone mentorship programs
They focus on making them more skilful
They claim that in 20202021
more Scaled learners got placement in Amazon
compared to all the IITs combined
They provide the learners with every tool
with which they can become more skilled
and can further their careers

Id recommend their Software Development Course
and the Data Science course
They would help you achieve the right fundamentals
and you would get basic problemsolving skills
Lets return to the topic
So whats special about the AirCar?
It completed its first intercity flight in June last year
From the international airport Nitra to the Bratislava airport
Both cities are in Slovakia
And Slovakia is an Eastern European country
Last month the Transport Authority of Slovakia
gave it clearance for takeoff
It received the Certificate of Airworthiness
The European Aviation Safety Agencys
all testing safety standards are obeyed by this flying car
This is the first flying car to actually look like a flying car
They used a BMW car as a base
and have attached wings to it
The attempts of 6070 years ago
was when they tried to stick a part of the aeroplane to a car
But this is the first attempt
where the wings come out of the car
No special fuel is needed to fly it
The petrol that you get at the petrol station
is enough to fly this car
Because a 16l BMW engine is fitted inside it
While flying this AirCar can reach a height of 8000 feet
And it can fly at the speed of 190 kmhr
And a maximum of 2 people can sit in the car
And to transform from an aeroplane to a car
it takes only 3 minutes
This is the way it transforms
The wings can be folded to the back
And everythings automatic
Theres no need to unscrew anything or to separate anything
It is all in one piece
You can see the wings going into the back of the car slowly
and it is transforming into a compact car
On the road this AirCar would look like this
It looks like a normal car on the road almost
But it is a little overboard at the back
It isnt bad
Because some cars are long at the back
One things certain
to fly this you would need a pilots license
because it needs a proper runway to take off
This AirCar has completed more than 200 takeoffs and landings
so theres no doubt that it is a successful flying car
If you want to buy it
how much would you need to pay?
Its said that its price will start from 500000 ranging to 1 million
depending upon the model you want to buy
And within 12 months
it will become commercially available
Meaning you can buy it in the market then
The founder of Jetson 1 had said that
they see their aircraft as a means to have fun
Its supposed to be used by people as a fun activity
But the company that has made the AirCar
Klein Vision
they believe that this AirCar
will replace helicopters in the future
Because the internal combustion engine of a normal car is used in it
it would mean that its very energy efficient
Normally to fly helicopters and aeroplanes
a lot of fuel is used
They need special fuel
But since this AirCar can fly with a cars engine
it would mean that in the future
it wouldnt be very difficult to use the engine of an electric car
to fly this AirCar
It means that
a fully electric AirCar can be possible
It will be good for the environment
in comparison to helicopters and normal airplanes
The most important question to arise here is
Whats the need for this?
Can there be a practical use for these flying cars?
The most important use for these flying cars is said to be
for emergency services
Such as for ambulances fire engines or for the police
One advantage would be that it would be easier to use than helicopters
And theres no need to build separate infrastructure for them
Railway tracks need to be laid for trains
tunnels have to be dug for metros
roads need to be built for cars
but for the flying cars the same infrastructure can be used
that already exist
Another major advantage of these is that
these are very flexible
Talking about Jetson 1 aircraft
they can land and take off from anywhere
We will get endtoend connectivity here
And obviously the environmental impact
can be reduced drastically
because normally cars take a long time to cover long distances
but flying cars would be able to do it faster
And theyll consume less energy as well
But if you talk about their disadvantages
perhaps they have more disadvantages than advantages
The first is that
Do we really need flying cars?
Lets compare it with the cars
Nowadays cars have become very common
in almost every city of every country in the world
Everyone needs to take a driving test to get a drivers license
But despite that
many people drive irresponsibly
there are accidents
so many people die in traffic accidents around the world
If people cant learn to drive properly on the road
will they be able to learn to fly properly?
Itll be 10 times more difficult
Itll have 10 times more scope of causing accidents
And if an accident does occur midair
it would be that much more deadly
This is a very serious issue
how many people would need to get sufficient pilot training
to fly these?
A solution to this problem can be
automated flying cars
That the flying cars fly automatically with interference from the pilot
Like the automated cars nowadays
Tesla already has these features
where the car can drive itself
If such selfdriving flying cars are made
only then can this problem be avoided
But talking about Tesla
Elon Musk believes flying cars to be a bad idea
Because according to him
when there will be thousands of cars flying in the sky
somewhere or other therell be an accident
and if one of those cars fell on someones head
that person will die instantly
The risk of people losing their lives in these accidents is very high
And normally when your car breaks down
you park it at the side of the road to check it
But if your car breaks down in the sky where would you park it?
These problems would increase in bad weather
Imagine that you are flying your car
and it is very windy
or theres a thunderstorm
suppose theres a lot of turbulence
Normally since the aeroplanes are much larger
they can bear it
But in smaller private jets
theres an increased threat from turbulence and bad weather
And since the flying cars wouldnt be very big
theyll face the same threats
After this theres also the problem of safety
Its true that no new infrastructure is needed for a couple of flying cars
but if thousands of cars fly in the sky
a new system of traffic lights will need to be put up
Such as the ones for cars
Since the cars will be flying in all directions theres a dire need for traffic lights
Newt technical standards would need to be enforced
so that the flying cars could communicate with each other
so that there arent collisions and crashes
But it wouldnt be easy to do this
Because today it is so difficult for governments to make regulations for drones
That the governments take to banning drones
And these drones merely fly to take aerial photos and videos
To do so for the flying cars
how difficult it would be from the governments perspective
you can already imagine it
Then comes the problem of noise pollution
If you have flown any small drone
you would have noticed the loud sound while flying it
Or if youve gone closer to a helicopter
it is on the next level
Thats why you need to put on headphones in the helicopter
These same problems exist for flying cars
These problems exist in Jetson 1 and AirCar too
It creates a lot of noise
It is so noisy that it isnt practical to use it in the urban environment now
To deal with this a new technological innovation is needed
So that the noise level of the flying cars can be reduced to a bearable extent
Apart from noise another area which needs some innovation is the
fast charging technology
Nowadays drones can be flown for up to 20 minutes only
How long would the flying cars last in the air?
With the present technology
it can fly up to 50 km only
after that they would need to be charged or refuelled
And it takes up a lot of time
These are the practical problems
that need to be solved in the future
for this technology to be successful
Even if all these problems are solved
the final problem to arise here
would be the cost
After so many innovations
the final price of the flying car
would be at a level where people would actually want to buy it?
Will it be practical for people to buy it?
Now the AirCar costs around 1 million
if the cost isnt affordable
it would be very difficult for it to be truly successful
This is valid for any new technology
If the competing technologies are offered at a much better cost
the competing technologies would be the ones to be successful in the future
If travelling by cars trains and aeroplanes is at a much lower price
in comparison to flying cars
then the flying cars would never be successful
