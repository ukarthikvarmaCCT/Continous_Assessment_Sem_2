Hello friends!
13th January 2012
715 PM
The worlds largest Italian cruise ship
set sail for its 7day European tour
This ship was named the Costa Concordia
It was so big that
not only was it bigger than the Titanic
but it could seat an additional 2000 passengers
Thats why 4252 people are on board
If we talk about entertainment
this ship had everything!
4 big swimming pools 5 restaurants
13 different bars a casino
a basketball court a huge fitness centre
which had a gym a sauna a Turkish bath
and even an F1 racing simulator  was installed on this cruise ship
The first destination of this ship  was Savona a city in Italy
it was supposed to take about a day to reach there
But only 25 hours after the ship departed
everyone heard a sudden piercing noise
After that all the lights on the ship went off
And the ship started tilting towards one side
The time was 945 PM
A time when some people were sleeping in their rooms
and some were eating at the dinner tables
Some people who were sleeping woke up
and they came out of their cabins  to see what was happening
Meanwhile the plates of the  people sitting at the dinner table
started sliding down the side of the table
Passengers were told via intercom that
there was an electrical failure on the ship
But the fact was that
the engine of the ship had failed
The captain of the ship was hiding this fact from the people
After a while the ship started tilting to the other side
By then the passengers somewhat realised that
this was not an ordinary electrical failure
People were worried that this was  another incident similar to Titanics
Coincidentally the Titanic accident happened exactly 100 years ago
in 1912
And now when this ship had an electrical failure
the famous Titanic theme song  was playing in the dining hall of this ship
My Heart Will Go On
Slowly the ship started tilting more
It tilted to the right side
and the lower rooms were being filled with water
By then people had realized that  the ship was going to sink
But why were the passengers not being informed properly?
Why was the ships captain so quiet?
This ship was operated by an  Italian company called Costa Crociere
Initially this company operated only cargo ships
But in 1948 they launched their Costa lines
Soon after it became one of the  biggest cruise ship companies in Europe
Later in 2000 a company named  Carnival Corporation bought it
So Costa Croisiere became  a subsidiary company of Carnival
In June 2006 they launched their first ship
of the Concordia class
The Costa Concordia that were talking about today
The biggest Italian cruise ship of its time
The cost of making it was 570 million
25 billion at that time
That day the captain of this ship was
Francesco Schettino an Italian man
who had been working for this company since 2002
Remember his name
because he plays an important role in our story
At 718 PM this ship left for its first destination Savona
And only two hours had passed that
this ship deviated from its normal route
It was not a mistake
Captain Schettino wanted to  take the ship by a particular island
The Giglio Island in Italy
He wanted the people of the island
to see the glittering ship in the dark of night
Whenever a ship passes near the land
it is called a sail past or sail by
Normally such big ships sail  at a distance of 78 km from the shore
well into the sea
because the water needs to be  deep enough for such a big ship to sail
But because of this sailby
this ship was only 150 m away from the shore
Obviously the water was not very deep
There can be big rocks or reefs  under the ship at this close distance
which can hit the ship
On top of that it was nighttime
and the ship was sailing quite fast
Later the report of the Italian Ministry of  Infrastructure and Transport confirmed this
At night the ship was sailing at an unsafe  distance very close to the shore
One question that will arise here is
why was the captain doing this?
The thing is Captain Schettino
used to work under Senior Captain Mario Palombo
And Mario was living on the Giglio Island
The night this ship was passing by this island
that night Captain Schettino
called Mario and told him that
since they would be passing by the island
they would sound a siren for him
as they wanted to give him a tribute
To this Mario said that
he was not on the island
instead he was in another Italian city
During this conversation the call line gets disconnected
This call was made at 940 PM
And a few minutes later
came the scary sound that I mentioned  at the beginning of the video
The thing everyone feared happened
This ship collided with the rocks in the water
This collision tore the hull of the Concordia ship
The ships sensitive part was injured by a 70meterlong wound
The place where this impact happened
was not even 100 meters away from the island
In the darkness of the night this ship
had reached so close to the island
Water started flowing into the ship rapidly
26yearold Andrea Corollo who was the third officer of the Concordia ship
was sleeping in his cabin when this incident happened
When he woke up and came out of his cabin
he saw that the water had already reached the hallway
He immediately ran to the engine room
When he reach there
he saw that the door could not be opened
Through the closed door
he could see that the generators and engines
were completely submerged in water
At 952 PM
the chief engineer and the other officers of the engine room
tried to start the emergency diesel generator
Unfortunately they failed in this attempt
The chief engineer went to inform Captain Chettino
about how bad the situation was
But the captain of the ship  announced to the passengers that
there was nothing to worry about
That it was a simple blackout
Over the next few minutes the ship was not standing still
rather it was moving forward
away from the island
At around 10 PM
Captain Schettino felt that
the ship should be turned around
He reasoned that if they sank it would be  more dangerous to be in the middle of the sea
It would be better to stay near the island
The ship took a Uturn
and thus instead of being upright
it started tilting to the other side
First it was tilting to the left
now it started tilting to the right
The ships crisis coordinator Roberto Ferrarini
called Captain Schettino twice
at 1005 PM and 1007 PM
In the second call Captain Schettino finally acknowledged that
the ship had some problems
But had he admitted these problems sooner
it would have been better
Turning away from the truth can be very dangerous
as you will see later in the story
And this applies to our lives too

Now if we get back to our topic
Captain Schettino did admit his mistake
but follows it with another act of stupidity
He tried to cover up his mistakes
He claimed that the blackout
caused the accident
He reverses the timeline
In reality the accident caused the blackout
In the meanwhile some distressed  passengers tried to call the local police
At 1012 PM
the Italian coast guard called the ships captain
Asking him what was happening on the ship
And informing him that passengers of the ship were contacting them
On the other hand the captain said  that nothing devastating had happened
they simply had a blackout
He told them not to worry
When this was said
half an hour had already passed since the collision
Ten more minutes pass
and Captain Schettinos finally changed his stance
After all how long could he suppress the truth with lies?
At 1022 PM
Schettino told the radio operator
to call and inform the coast guard
that there had been a collision on the left side of the ship
and that Concordia needed the help of tugboats
And that life jackets were handed out  to the passengers and everyone was safe
Each minute was important here
because the ship was gradually tilting more and more
Finally at 1033 AM
a general emergency alarm was raised
and the passengers were told
to gather in the emergency assembly areas
and wait for further instructions
At 1048 PM
the ship was tilted 30
More than an hour had passed since the accident
At 1054 PM
finally Captain Schettino gave orders
to abandon the ship
Think about it friends
More than 4200 people were stuck on this ship
And this ship was tilted by 30
Many of the lower cabins were submerged in the water
and things were strewn about in the upper decks
nothing was in its place
In this situation the captain had made only one reasonable decision
To take a Uturn
Now based on this one good decision
the lying egoistic Captain was trying to garner support
and wanted people to see him as a hero because of this decision
Undoubtedly this decision was needed
But the rest of his decisions were unreasonable
and entirely wrong decisions
On top of that he was piling up his lies
and misguiding passengers on this sinking ship
Later on our captain did something
after which he was thoroughly criticised by the people
As soon as he gave the order to abandon the ship
there was a huge commotion in Concordia
Some people had already fled using  lifeboats before this announcement
Some of the others were confident that they could swim
so they jumped into the water
They swam to the island nearby
But after the signal by the captain chaos ensued
The mob of passengers ran towards the lifeboats
People pushed and shoved one another to get to the lifeboats
One good thing was that
fed up by Captain Schettinos behaviour
some of the crew members
were already rebelling against the captain
Ten to fifteen minutes before his order
the passengers were taken out of their cabins
and put into the lifeboats
A steward came over to us
because the key card wasnt working
And told us  Take your coat take your life jacket
In the darkness of the night the ship was slowly falling to the right
A 40 tilt a 50 tilt
By this point the passengers whose cabins were on the right side
had reached the surface level of the sea
So they could easily jump into the water  and head towards the island
But the problem was for those
who were on the other side of the ship
In a tilted ship
how could they find the way out?
In the midst of all this an Indian staff member was also present
Karnaatha Rameshana
the only woman in the 11member security staff of Concordia
She later stated how language barriers started to emerge
Most of the passengers on the cruise ship were Italian
but many of the crew members did not know Italian
On top of that another problem was that
most of the crew members were not trained for such emergency situations
They were just service staff
Despite all these problems
some crew members were truly heroes
Karnaatha personally seated a blind woman on a lifeboat
Two other members lifted wheelchairbound passengers on their shoulders
and seated them on the lifeboats
That night another Indian crew member was present on the ship
Russell Rebello
he was working as a waiter
Before Captain Schettinos order
he was helping the passengers to get on the lifeboats
He kept helping passengers on the sinking ship till the last moment
but unfortunately Russel was among those
who couldnt save themselves
during this evacuation
We dont know what happened to him exactly
but he drowned while helping the passengers
this we know for sure
Indian waiter Russel Rebello is said to
have d!ed after giving up his own lifejacket
to save one passenger
and helping others into lifeboats
On the other hand there were people like Captain Schettino
who instead of helping the passengers
abandoned the ship at the earliest
and went towards the island
Italian cruise ship captain
apparently ran for lifeboat
and got off the wreck
while his crew and passengers
were still on board fighting for their lives
Yup you heard that right
The same captain who tried to cover it up with lies
Wasted an hour before telling the truth to the passengers
And as soon as he made the announcement
within some minutes at 1119 PM
he was among the first crew members
to abandon the ship
Giglio island is like a small village
Not many people live there
This island has a population of only 700 people
But that night when the incident happened
some people came out of their homes to see what was happening
As soon as the deputy mayor of this island Mario Pellegrini came to know that
a ship was sinking
despite being a civilian he went to the ship to help the people
Without thinking for a minute
he jumped into the lifeboat
and went into the sea to help the people
He said that when the ship had completely fallen to the right side
wells of water were being formed inside the ship
people were trapped in these
He arranged for a rope
and used the rope to rescue the people trapped in the well
In this early stage of evacuation
around 2500 to 3300 people had safely reached the island
At 1138 PM
around 400 people were still trapped in the ship
The Italian Coast Guard helicopters and fire and rescue services boats
had also arrived to help people
They saved a few hundred people from underwater
but they didnt know how many more people were still trapped in the ship
At 1242 AM
the Coast Guard commander Captain Gregorio De Falco
called Captain Schettino
we have the actual recording of this call
In his anger he told Schettino directly
that as the captain he should go back on the ship
He ordered Schettino to go back
and find out about the passengers still on board
He told Schettino that he shouldnt have left his passengers and ran away
Schettino started making excuses
and saying that he couldnt go back
Despite all of this Captain Schettino did not go back
This is why people started calling him Captain Coward later
On one hand some brave crew members  and the Italian Coast Guard team
kept helping people all night
Schettino sat at a safe distance and watched it play out
When the sun rose the next morning  and the ship could be seen properly
people realised the magnitude of the incident
Look at these photos taken in the morning
Exactly where this collision happened
you can see that part too
The sheer size of the collision
Most of the people had been rescued by morning
Three people had been confirmed d3ad
but some people were still trapped in the ship
Meanwhile the residents of Giglio had found out about this incident
and many locals went to help
700 people were living on the island
but there were 4000 people on the ship
The residents opened their homes  to provide shelter to the passengers
Elizabeth Nani who worked in Giglio Tourist Information
reported that all the survivors were in shock
Some people were suffering from hypothermia
because the water was very cold
But everyone was desperate
and was trying to locate their family members and friends
Schools churches and canteens on this island were opened
so that the survivors could get a roof over their heads
They were also given blankets and dry clothes
But on the other hand the rescue operation was still going on
It would last for the next 225 weeks
The Italian Navy Coast Guard Fire and Rescue Service
everyone had to get involved
Rescue divers were also needed
because the people who were still trapped  were not able to open the cabin doors
The water pressure on the other side was so high that
they remained trapped inside the cabin
On 14th January a South Korean couple was rescued
who were trapped inside their cabin like this
Most of the people who were k!lled in this incident
d!ed because of this
Trapped inside their cabin
they drowned
Had they been informed on time
their lives could also have been saved
A total of 32 people d!ed in this accident
The next problem was to remove fuel from the sunken ship
and to rescue the ship  so that it would not remain lying there
When the engineers analyzed the ship
it was declared a constructive total loss
This meant that there was no chance of saving it
This ship could not be used again
The only option was to disassemble it
and sell its scrap metal
First of all the ship contained around 19 million litres of fuel
It was a fully loaded ship
It had just started sailing
Thats why the fuel tank was full
To extract fuel an oil barrier was built around the ship
On 12 February 2012 the oil removal process began
Since it was wintertime
another problem was that
a lot of fuel was in a semisolid state
So it was necessary to reheat it
before extracting it
After heating it another tanker ship was used
and all the oil was transferred from  one vessel to the other with a pump
This process lasted more than a month
This process continued till 24th March
Now the next thing was to  set the ship upright
and to relocate it was an engineering project
A steel structure was built in the water
so that the ship could be raised once again
Work on this started a year later in April 2013
After this huge boxes were placed on the upper side of the ship
Water was filled in these boxes
to make them heavier
Ropes and cables were then used
to pull these boxes as weights
These watertight boxes are called caissons
15 such caissons were installed in total
On 16th September 2013
the actual process of straightening the Concordia began
It took 19 hours to do this
You can see how this was done
By using pulling machines steel structures and caissons
The next step was to make the ship float on water
For this more boxes were used
Caissons were installed on the other side as well
after that water was drained out from the caissons
which caused the caissons to float
And as the caissons started floating
the entire ship started floating with them
A sound usually used to warn
bled out to shout success
500 divers technicians engineers and  biologists were involved in this process
19 months had passed since the accident
and the cost of rescuing this ship alone
was 799 million
To take this ship to the port another ship was used to tow it
This was done in July 2014
Till then the total cost of this operation
had reached 12 billion
But the company still had more such expenses to bear
It took a lot of effort and money  to scrap metal from this broken ship
More than 350 people worked on this
and this process ended in July 2017
But after rescuing people
a steady stream of legal cases had begun
Finally this company returned the price of each surviving passengers ticket
and paid an additional 11000 as compensation
This is around 1 million per passenger
Apart from this the families of the deceased passengers
were paid an undisclosed amount
The total cost of this disaster for this company
was 2 billion
But you must be wondering
what happened to the captain of the ship?
The guy who was the sole reason behind this incident
lied to his passengers
and didnt give them timely information
and when the ship started sinking
he abandoned the ship first and ran away
Even after the incident
Captain Schettinos habit of lying didnt go away
When the case was being tried in court
he told the court that
when the ship was at an angle of 6070
his foot slipped and he fell into a lifeboat
And he apparently fell in a peculiar way that
he was shipped off
Obviously no one found this argument believable
The judge did not believe this at all
In 2017 Captain Schettino was charged with manslaughter
and he was sentenced to 16 years in jail
Moving forward some more interesting  facts about Schettino were revealed
Mario Palombo whom I had  talked about at the beginning of the video
who was the senior captain
in 2003 Schettino worked under him
Palombo revealed that Schettino had always been a liar
He said that in many cases instead of admitting his mistakes
Schettino preferred to lie
That night it was a matter of chance that
there was another ships captain was onboard the Concordia
Roberto Bosio
He was the captain of the Costa Serena
but that night he was on Concordia
But unlike Schettino
he didnt flee the ship
He kept helping people till the end
And in fact even before Schettinos official announcement
he had already started evacuating the people
Later he said
Only a disgraceful man would have  left all those passengers on board
It was the most horrible experience of my life
a tragedy a heartache that I will always carry with me forever
Dont call me a hero
I just did my duty
A captains duty
Actually this should be the duty of all humans
Along with the captain 5 people were arrested
Especially the highranking officers on the ship that night
Each of them was sentenced to 2 years
Because the biggest mistake was made by Captain Schettino
Today 11 years after this incident
Schettino is serving his sentence in jail
And if you learn anything from this story it is this
Never give the captaincy of your ship
to a lying coward
who doesnt know how to admit his mistakes
Leaders who never admit to their mistakes
and lie to hide their mistakes
can be extremely dangerous
