Hello friends!
12th October 1972
A small chartered aircraft  took off from Uruguay South America
This aircraft was going to  Santiago the capital of Chile
Carrying some rugby players tall and broad
There were 45 passengers in total
some of the players family and friends had tagged along
This flight was not going to be long
Usually it takes only 3 hours  to go from Uruguay to Santiago
But on the way you come across the huge Andes Mountains
The Andes Mountain Range in South America
is the worlds longest mountain range
Other than the Himalayan mountains
the highest mountains are found here
These beautiful mountains become  devastating for the passengers in our story
That day on 12th October
there was a storm in the mountains
because of which the plane couldnt keep flying
The pilots then decided
to stop midway
and try to fly again the next day
The plane landed in Mendoza Argentina for the night
The next day on October 13th
the plane took off again at 218 pm
The pilots ensured that the weather had cleared up
So it was a smoothsailing flight for the next hour
At 321 pm the pilots start descending the plane
The plane was quite close to Santiago
but was still in the mountains
Since there are high mountains right next to the city
While descending suddenly there was terrible turbulence
The plane started shaking horizontally
Around this time clouds gathered around the plane
Nothing was visible except the clouds
Suddenly the alarms in the plane went off
and the warning lights began to flash
No one could understand why
The rugby players in the passenger seats werent scared
They didnt take this turbulence seriously
Amid jokes a passenger looked out of the window
and saw the clouds clearing up
But then he noticed that they were  perilously close to a mountain
As soon as the aircraft moved out of the clouds
the pilots realized that they were moving towards a huge rock
Immediately in a panic
they try to lift the plane up
The aircrafts ground collision alarm was ringing loudly
Pilots put in maximum power into gaining altitude
To fly over the mountain safely
But unfortunately it was too late
The rear of the aircraft collided  with the mountain while going up
The entire rear portion of the plane separateed
The two rows of seats at the back
literally flew out of the plane
Three passengers flew away with it and disappeared
The plane kept flying upwards for a few more seconds
but then suddenly it started to fall down
After a few seconds another collision happened
The left wing of the plane broke
Some more passengers flew  out of the plane and fell down
Now only the front portion of the plane remained
and it fell into a glacier
It slid down the glacier at a speed of 350 kmh
and finally it crashed after dropping 700 meters
Everything in the plane was destroyed
The passenger seats were torn apart from the base of the plane
The cockpit of the plane was completely crushed
and the pilots were killed immediately
This aircraft lay broken on an  unknown mountain in the Andes
at a height of 3570 meters
Surprisingly out of the 45 people on board
33 were still alive
They had somehow survived this crash
The problem was that many of them were injured
and no one knew where they were stuck
It was later found that this plane
was 80 km off from its planned route
And this painful story of survival
had just begun friends
Neither those people could have imagined at that time
nor you can imagine now
what happened to these survivors next
This is the heartwrenching story
of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571
Lets know about it in todays video
Plane crashed in Andes Mountains
45 persons were aboard
Given up for dad
Survival fascinates people
All of the passengers were given up for dad
It became known as the Miracle of the Andes
Right after this crash
there were two survivors who werent seriously injured
First 19yearold Roberto Canessa
and the other 20yearold Gustavo Zerbino
Since both of them were medical students
they immediately started checking
who was alive and how to help the injured
They saw that many passengers
had suffered severe injuries
One of them was 23yearold Fernando Parrado
who was in a coma due to a skull fracture
These two medical students tried their best
to help the survivors
On the other hand within an hour of the planes disappearance
the Chilean Air Search and Rescue Service received a notification
Four aircraft were deployed to search for the survivors
They tried to find the crash site from dusk till night
but unfortunately they didnt find anything
The rescue service officers concluded after hearing the radio transmissions
that the aircraft must have crashed in a remote and inaccessible area
The problem was that the aircraft was white in colour
and it had crashed in a place where
there was white snow and ice all around
It was very difficult to locate it in the snowy mountains
On the night of 13th October
the remaining passengers were very hopeful
They hoped that if they would somehow spent a night there
and find a way to escape the cold
then someone would find them the next day
Five injured passengers couldnt survive that snowy night
The number of survivors fell from 33 to 28
These survivors used the remaining body of the plane as a shelter
They used luggage seats and snow
to close the rear of the plane
so that they could stay warm inside
The next day on 14th October
11 different aircraft from Argentina Chile and Uruguay
were put into search operation
The search area they chose was correct
The location of the crash site was in that search area
But still they were not able to find the crash site
Survivors tried to use lipstick to write SOS on the planes roof
They started writing SOS
but soon realized that
they didnt have enough lipstick to write all the letters
Then they tried to use suitcases to make a big cross in the snow
so that search aircraft flying above could see them
But soon they realized that this was not working
That day they saw not one not two but three aircraft flying over them
They screamed waved their hands and tried their best
to make the aircraft notice them
but they were unsuccessful
Another day passed in this attempt
The next day 15th October
the survivors realized that
they needed water to stay alive
A passenger named Fito Strauch
found a way to get water
He used a metal sheet as a solar collector
so that the sunrays could be concentrated
to melt the snow
And he collected water droplets in empty wine bottles
Apart from this many passengers used the seat cushions like snowshoes
and the wool in the seat covers was used
to protect them from the cold
The next day on 16th October
three days after the crash
Fernando Parrado woke up from his coma
As soon as he regained consciousness
he saw that his mother passed away in the crash
and his 19yearold sister was severely injured
Parrado tried his best to keep his sister alive
he brought food and water for her
But as the days went by
8 days after the crash
his sister succumbed to her injuries
Such accidents remind us
how uncertain life is
and how unpredictable it is
We dont know how long we will live
Thats why it is said
Live every moment
Live every day every moment in your life
because who knows tomorrow may not come
But theres also the question of
In our daily lives
considering other tensions like work
how can one find time for things one likes?
This is what I have explained
in my Time Management course

Now lets get back to the topic
Most of the passengers were from coastal areas
Before this they had never seen snow
And now suddenly in the cold of 30 Celsius
at such a high altitude without proper food and water
they were somehow surviving
In these bad conditions there was another problem
Snow blindness
When the ultraviolet rays of the sun reflect  on the snow and ice in the mountains
it can damage your eyes
This is called snow blindness
These survivors had only 3 pairs of sunglasses
On 21st October 8 days after the crash
search and rescue teams gave up
They believed that since they could not find any signs of survivors in those 8 days
there was no point in continuing the search operation
There was little chance that anyone could have survived after so many days
So after 142 hours of search operation
this search operation was officially stopped
Meanwhile the survivors found a transistor radio
among the seats of the aircraft
A survivor rugby player Roy Harley
was also an electronics enthusiast
So he tried to switch on the radio
He made a long antennae by improvising
And because of his efforts finally the radio started working
This radio could communicate one way only
The survivors could hear things
but could not send any messages
They turned on the radio 11 days after the crash
and then they came to know that
the search operation had been cancelled
Their hearts were completely broken
Some people start crying after hearing this news
Some people clasped their hands and started praying to God
Feeling that their world is alive
and they consider you dead
Fernando Parrado was the only one who did not react much after hearing this news
Because he was planning something else
By the 11th day survivors were running out of food
They didnt have much to begin with
There were only 8 chocolate bars
1 tin of mussels
3 small jars of jam
a jar of almonds
A box of peanuts some dates candies dried plums
and a few bottles of wine
A few days after the crash they started rationing food
They ate very little each day
Parrado ate a chocolatecovered peanut for 3 days
Just one peanut
But rationing was not enough
Because the food was almost over
There were no trees or plants at an altitude of 3800 meters
nor were there any animals that could be killed and eaten
By the 11th day the food was completely gone
and some people tried to eat some parts of the plane
They tried eating the cotton in the seats
and the leather on the seats
But this made them more sick
In such a situation when there was  no option other than starving to dath
these survivors did something
that will shock you
To stay alive they decided
there was no option other than eating  the dad bodies of their friends and family
It was not an easy decision to make
Because most of the people who were klled in this crash
were friends classmates family members or relatives
We have to eat
and the only probable things
were the dad bodies  of the people that were in this plane
Since Canessa came up with this idea
he was the first to try it
Some others tried to but they couldnt
They refused then
But 2 days later
with no other option
finally even they chose to eat human meat
On 29th October 16 days after the crash
this food source was also depleting rapidly for the survivors
They had no plan of action
No one knew what to do next
The situation could not have been worse
But then that night
they heard a loud grumble
It turned out to be an avalanche
Large amount of snow was descending so fast from the mountain top
that it filled the broken plane with snow
Eight people were lost in the snow and suffocated
Only 19 survivors remained
Ted Roberto you had it  Youre going to d!e
Thats it
A very nice sensation of heat between my legs
because I was peeing on myself
and saying thats it
These remaining 19 people were also  trapped in a small space under the snow
Parrado used a metal pole
to make a hole in the snow
to allow some ventilation
After working hard for two days
they dug a tunnel under the snow
and with great difficulty they managed to get to the surface
As soon as they got out
they saw a snowstorm was coming
and it would be prudent to go back  into the snow cave to survive
For the next three days the remaining survivors
somehow managed to stay in the cramped space
3 days later they went back up to the surface
and the weather was clear
After coming out the survivors realized that
no one was coming to save them
If they wanted to stay alive
they would need to put in the efforts themselves
There was no point in sitting at the crash site waiting for help
They needed to try their best till the last breath
Canessa Parrado and Vizintin
were among the strongest survivors
They decided together
to give them more food and the warmest clothes
and they would try to walk around looking for help
The first task was to estimate the location
Before the crash
the copilot had stated that
their aircraft had passed through Curico
So they estimated that
if they walked a few kilometres to the west
they would definitely reach some countryside areas of Chile
But their estimation was extremely wrong
Actually the copilot didnt know
where he was taking the plane
In reality their crash site
was 89 km east
in the middle of the Andes mountains
Still unaware of this
they rested for a few days to build up their energy
On November 15 33 days after the crash
these three people set out to find help
After travelling for hours towards the east
they found the rear piece of their aircraft
It was the part of the plane that had broken apart first
Inside it they found many suitcases
boxes of chocolates three meat patties
a bottle of rum extra clothes
comic books and some medicines
And along with this they found
the aircrafts twoway radio system
A radio that can not only facilitate incoming communication
but can also send messages
They decided to spend the night there
The next day of the expedition
they walk a little further east
but after discussing it they believed that
they should try to turn on the aircrafts radio
They decided to get some batteries out of the main body of the aircraft
and then try to start the radio
They would be able to send out an SOS call
They found 24 kg batteries in the tail section
but it was very heavy
They could not carry it back to the main body crash site
So they decided to try to turn it on right there
They went back and took the help of Roy Harley
the one who had some knowledge of electronics
but unfortunately this plan didnt work
The thing was that
the aircrafts electrical system
worked with a 115V AC
and their battery was a 24V DC
They had no means to connect them
They tried their best to start the radio for a few days
but soon realized that there was no other way
To survive they now had to start walking Westwards
On 11th December 59 days after the crash
an avalanche hit
Three more survivors were k!lled in it
I was trapped completely by the storm the avalanche
it was the most dadly silence that you may imagine
I couldnt move
Only 16 remained
To climb the mountains in the west
they needed a way to sleep at night
How could they survive the cold nights of 30 Celsius?
Among the survivors was an 18yearold boy
Carlos Miguel Rodriguez
He remembered that his mother had taught him to sew with needles
He was carrying his needles and sewing kit with him
His idea was to stitch different pieces of clothing
to make a big sleeping bag
I had the idea that with the insulation
you can make a sleeping bag
But I not only had the idea
I made it myself
They did this
The next day December 12
two months had passed since the day this crash happened
These three brave men Parrado Canessa and Vizintin
set out without any mountaineering gear
to climb the glacier
The only certain thing was to the West was Chile
Going westward meant that
they would have to climb the mountain first
before going down
They still believed that
they were only a few kilometres away
So they hoped that they would find help by walking for 23 days
So they packed a 3day supply of meat
And you can imagine
without any skill without any training
youre like a child!
You are confronted with a snowstorm
you try to go straight up
you might be using your hands and your feet
youre slipping and sliding
And with every step that you go up
you slide back half a step
To protect himself against the cold Parrado wore three pairs of jeans
He was also wearing 3 sweaters on top of his tshirt
and 4 pairs of socks on his feet
He was also wearing a plastic shopping bag over the socks
The cold was so bad
They had no technical gear
no map no compass
and no climbing experience
And at this height the air gets quite thin
and one starts feeling the lack of oxygen
But despite that
they kept moving forward towards the mountain
The sleeping bag they had stitched
was useful at night
During the day they kept moving forward taking slow steps
The three of them in that one sleeping bag
slept as close to each other as possible
And as soon as the sun rose they started walking
Gradually they kept moving forward together
The second day the third day
and on the morning of the fourth day they realized that
their estimation was grossly wrong
Ahead they could see no end to their journey
Because they had little to no food
Vizintin decided to return to the crash site
and only the other two would go ahead
so that less food was needed
On 15th December Vizintin started going back
which was easier
because it was all downhill
He used an aircraft seat as a sleigh
and within an hour he reached the crash site
It took them three days to climb this mountain
but in just one hour
he was back at the crash site
Parrado and Canessa kept climbing the mountain
After three hours
they reached the peak of the mountain
and saw that all around them
there was only mountains as far as they could see
There was nothing except the snowy mountains
I couldnt breathe
I couldnt speak
I couldnt even think
because what we saw was horrible
Instead of green valleys
we saw mountains
and snowcovered peaks
360 around us
to the horizon all around us
With great difficulty Parrado tried to find something else to see
On the far western horizon
they saw two mountains peaks
without snow
They assumed that they should keep travelling in that direction
They couldnt give up
Parrado and Canessa keep hiking for many days
Finally they reached a valley
A valley where they could see a river flowing
In this situation reaching the river was a great relief
Because while travelling downstream the river
it was easy to find a downhill path
They kept on walking and walking
And finally after trekking for 9 days
on 20th December
they could find some presence of humans
They could see some cows in the fields
They were so tired by this point
that they couldnt walk farther
Right then on the other side of the river
Look a man on a horse!
They saw 3 men on horses
Parrado tried to shout
But the river was so loud that those people couldnt hear him
But by chance one of them spotted Parrado and Canessa
He looked at them and shouted back
He said that he would be back the next day
The next day the man comes back on horseback
and this time brought some paper and pencils with him
He attached the paper and pencil to a stone with a thread
and threw it to the other side of the river
For the first time Parrado had the opportunity to send his message to the world
Parado wrote in Spanish on the paper
I come from a plane that fell in the mountains
That he was from Uruguay
And had been walking for 10 days
And that his injured friends were at the crash site
He wrote that they needed help urgently
but didnt know how to get help
They didnt have any food
They were weak
And they didnt have it in them to walk anymore
He asked to be saved
He asked where they were
On the other hand the person who received this message
was a farmer from Chile
Sergio Catalan
He read this note
and told him with gestures that he understood
After talking to his two friends
it turned out that they did remember vaguely
A few months ago they had heard on the news that a plane crashed
And when these friends realized this
they were shocked
They couldnt believe that there were  survivors of a 2monthold plane crash
Sergio threw a piece of bread to the other side of the river
and for the next 10 hours
on a horse he rode towards west
They were still so far from any village or human settlement
Finally when he reached the nearest city
the army command was informed about this
and he contacted the army headquarters in Santiago
Meanwhile the farmers brought Parrado and Canessa to Los Maitenes on horses
Where they finally get some rest
It was found that on sheer will
they had hiked 61 km on foot over the last 10 days
Canessa had lost half of his body weight
He weighed only 44 kgs then
As soon as other people got to know about their story
it became international news
This heartwrenching story was truly unbelievable
The Chilean Air Force sends 3 helicopters to immediately rescue the survivors
Army officers interviewed Parrado and Canessa
to get information about the location
Parrado had brought the pilots flight chart with him
and he had plotted the places where they were hiking
Army officers took him with them on the helicopter
to locate the crash site
With Parrados help the location of the remaining survivors
was finally discovered by the army commanders
On 22nd December 1972
70 days after the crash
two search and rescue helicopters finally reached
the survivors to save their lives
In total 16 survivors were rescued
They were in a terrible condition
Altitude sickness dehydration
broken bones malnutrition
But all of them recovered
This story is a lesson to the world about hope
If you have decided to do something
and you have patience and humanity
then nothing is impossible
If you want you can achieve things
that you can never even dream of
As they say Where theres a will theres a way
Thats why there is another name for this disaster
the Miracle of the Andes
