We are now stranded on a raft in the middle of the ocean
and there goes our boat
We are now stranded for seven days
How much longer?  Seven days
This raft is literally countless miles
from the nearest civilization
And whether we like it or not
my four friends and I are stuck on this raft
And its not going to be easy This is brutal
It wont stop raining! Were all at rock bottom now
This challenge went from fun to a literal nightmare
Very fast
Bro look how far away the boat is
I cant even see it anymore
So step one
Were going to get sunburned if we dont get shade
And I had survival specialists
equip this raft with tons of wood rope and everything else
We would need to build ourselves a shelter
Boys we need to get started We are running out of light!
I got this My finger!
Now we set these up like a teepee
We picked the worst day to start
As you can tell by the clouds its literally about the storm
So first thing we want to do is set up some structure to cover us
since were on this slab of wood for the next seven days
we need a place to hide from the sun
so we dont get sunburned
So two birds one stone
Speaking of birds while we were building
this happened  A bird!
Its coming right at us!  Oh my god! Its a bird!
This is crazy
We should name him  Whats his name?
Bryan Bryan Bryan Bryan
What if you went and got some fish?
I know hes looking at me He understands
Jimmy just say the word  Put the knife away
Okay Ill put the knife away  And the hatchet
Bryan that was a joke
Forget the bird We got to build a shelter
Were making friends  While Bryan watched
We worked on our first shelter for the rest of the day
Except for my friend Tareq
who spent the entire day getting cool drone shots
And Im not even mad about it
Inside this crate is the food for all
five of us for the next seven days
Oh my God
And in these two barrels
is our entire water supply for all five of us
How does it taste?
Very hot Were screwed
There was dirt in my cup
Its getting dark and that crate has the word sleep on it
Hopefully the survival guides gave us something soft
Why are they wet?  Things do get wet on a boat
Im ready for bed I wanna go to sleep
This is night one and Bryan is just yawning
This is miserable
This is all the coverage we have
I didnt realize what I was signing up for Its hot
This thing will not stop swaying and I feel like Im going to puke
And Im surrounded by a bunch of sweaty people
Aye sweaty men
If you guys smell this bad on day one
what are you going to smell like on day 7?
Oh gosh
Our first night of sleep was really rough
Sleeping is impossible
These waves are just making me miserable
And to make matters worse our best friend Bryan ended up
leaving us that morning
Bryan! Bryan!
But regardless todays objective is to build ourselves
a permanent weatherproof shelter
How do we turn that into a livable structure?
Theres definitely something here
Luckily I had them throw a bunch of wood on the raft
so we could build a nice house
How we build the house?
Im not quite sure but they said this is enough to build a house
But ironically right as we got started
Its raining!  Dont throw it!
Jimmy get my shark pillow!
This is miserable!
This is bad
Oh Jesus Christ
Youre not doing the right thing Nolan
Listen with your ears!  Why do you yell so much!
Because you dont listen!  I wanna hit Nolan!
Its just rain  Shut up!
At least we dont have to shower
Yeah This is so bad
And we still have over six days left
Where do we go poop?
Oh we have to build the pooper  What?
We have to build everything thats here
We have to build the toilet
Build our shelter the fire everything
The moment the rain finished
the boys and I needed to build all of our survival essentials
Starting with the shelter
Tearing it down in the name of something better
Five minute break for Chris
I also need a break
Im seasick Im out of it
You got to pick this up I cant
I cant pick it up anymore
I feel like youre doing all the work
but we got two other goofs just laying down
Im miserable
We built one wall
Yeah we built one wall  All together
All of us
Regardless of being seasick
it was going to take all of us if we wanted to finish this
Now you guys bring it forward There we go
Lets go!
How many YouTubers does it take to build a little structure?
Wait? Is that a whale?
Think thats a whale? Thats insane
Oh my God
Its unreal  There are actually whales
This experience just keeps getting better
Shelter water not being near Nolan
Im never going to take that for granted again
Probably would have been really useful to build the ladder first
We got a ladder I literally just built just 4 minutes ago
After hours of building we were finally getting somewhere
I severely regret making this a seven day challenge
instead of a 50 hour challenge
Like all our other videos We keep rocking back and forth
Its freakin miserable Im going to puke
And finally just as the sun was going down
Camp is now organized  Yeah!
Night two my bed is still broken but Im going to get some sleep
tonight because Im that tired
Im gonna head to bead Did I wake you?
Just go back to bed Im just vlogging
I accidentally woke Lazar up I feel bad now
This might be the most tired
Ive ever been in my entire life
Its now day three
And somehow our building didnt fall over
Ill take that as a dub
The noises that the structure made
while I was sleeping last night
filled me with nightmares
Its day three and weve really started to get into a rhythm
Our morning routine consisted of peeing in the corner
Bro who vlogs in the pee corner?
Im not moving
eating our breakfast  Surviving on Feastables
Its all you need?
and drinking hot barrel water
So dehydrated I need this
Were about 36 hours in and were almost halfway
through a barrel of water  Is that slow or fast
Were going to run out on day six
Running low on water and food gave me an idea
Im kind of curious to see whats under the boat people do
Theres so many fish below us!
So we decided
to try and catch some dinner but we werent very good at it
Why does it take so long?
I just want something to put my stomach
Bryan help us catch fish!
Turns out fishing is a lot harder than YouTube
After hours we caught absolutely nothing
Why cant we catch anything? Oh I give up
We were tired dehydrated and hungry
Which forced us to dig into our rations
Lets have ourselves a feast
Yeah! Call it a Feastables
In our supplies
We had wood to build a fire and pans to cook with
You take big stick and make really little sticks
and then make medium sticks
Then use the big sticks at the end
Look at them beans baby!
Im so excited This looks awesome
These are really good Can you tell weve been
at sea for three days?
Literally  When have I ever been this excited
over canned chili?
Hey I put some love into this one
Its not just canned chili anymore
Its got tomatoes kidney beans
You dont have to keep talking Im already drooling
This was our first
hot meal in days but it was also a good chunk of our rations
so we made sure to enjoy it
I feel a lot better
I think the first two days were definitely the most miserable
I think were slowly like losing our minds
and its actually becoming bearable
I still havent gone to the bathroom
Thats my biggest concern you know?
Im struggling to sleep
This raft is just rocking like crazy
Definitely Im kind of miserable
Hopefully tomorrow is better
None of us managed to get any sleep
We lost the back of our fort last night
The house needs some repairs
Tensions are pretty high on the raft this morning
Nolans a little upset He broke his bed
Oh my God
Nolan is struggling
Hes just in his feels right now
Itll be okay
He probably wouldve quit the channel if I did that
This is easily the worst
Oh theres thunder
I swear If it starts raining again
Oh I cant take that
And to make matters worse
we accidentally dropped our ladle in the drinking water
And since we havent showered in four days
grabbing it technically contaminated the drinking water
Im never drinking out of that again
Fast forward to when we run out of water
Because of the contamination
a third of our water was no longer safe to drink
Whatever reason the more I suffer the more you guys watch
some of our most popular videos
are when I buried myself alive spent time in solitary confinement
So I hope youre happy Im suffering again
Its not easy surviving on a raft but after four long days
Lazars finally pooping
Can you play a celebratory song?
LazarBeam is
pooping  Is pooping
See how all those clouds over there are dark?
Yeah Theyre going to pour down on us tonight
Tonights going to suck
We didnt know it yet
but the biggest storm of the entire challenge was headed right
towards us
And when we saw it approaching
we tried to prepare as much as possible
Cant wait for another storm just to destroy all this again
Tareqs fixing his side of the fort
Chris is fixing the roof and Im now the cameraman
for some reason
Theres a stormabrewing
And while theyre preparing the shelter
for the storm Im going to tell you about Shopify
because it might literally storm until the end of the challenge
This is going to be a bit rocky
Shopify is a platform that makes it easy for anyone
to start a business
They literally support millions of small businesses
all around the world from selling wood
to nails to crates to
Crocs they support businesses that sell it on Shopify
Assuming were going to have absolutely zero tops
covering this structure
I am worried about it
100 of what I sell online from merch to Feastables
I do with Shopify
Its actually getting pretty rocky out here
The wind is getting crazy!  Were out of nails!
Its really hard to work around the wind guys
Stop yelling and do things!
Shopify even has a new AI tool called Sidekick
making running your entire business easier
Just like surviving on this raft can be hard
so can entrepreneurship
And thats why they do everything in their power
to make it as easy as possible
This is my worst nightmare  Im so miserable!
Go to ShopifycomMrBeast
to give it a try right now Thank you Shopify
Lets go prep for the storm
Im soaking wet!
Maybe you can start helping us Jimmy
I was paying for the raft!
The storm was really starting to pick up
but that night it got so much worse
This really puts the helter in the shelter right?
Oh no you!
Are you kidding me?
Its leaking!  Oh no
This shelter is the opposite of waterproof
This is brutal
What do we do?
We have three more
The next three days by the way
No!  Theres water everywhere
Its useless
This does nothing
This is the most insane night yet
We are struggling right now
Is this safe anymore?
We couldve just filmed this in a studio
but no we have to be the real channel
that doesnt fake things
Were gonna die!
Were getting just destroyed Im getting hit
Theres a hole that is completely opened up over my bed
I cant do this
I cant do this  You can end this video Jimmy
Jimmy please
I tried to talk all you guys out of it
You all said yes!
This is the worst experience Ive ever had in my entire life
I hate every part of this
Im just miserable right now
The storm was reaching a new peak with every passing hour
We were desperate so we tried using our beds
as literal walls to protect us from the rain
Were all at rock bottom now
Its been raining for a few hours
Its freezing cold
We dont have beds Im getting nauseous
I dont know if were going to make it
these full seven days at this point
It rained nonstop for around 20 hours straight
and after
standing the whole night completely soaked and exhausted
we had to push ourselves to dry off our supplies and rebuild camp
Our raft is just in shambles
Look at our beds were drying them off
This is harder than Antarctica
This is harder than the desert video
Im just ready to be home
I hate this raft
I never want to see it again
Our entire fire pit is completely drenched
We couldnt start a fire if we wanted to tonight No dinner
And to make matters worse all of our food was completely soaked
Meaning only a portion of it was still safe to eat
We had stability we had food we had dry beds
and we took it for granted
We cant take another night like that
We need to waterproof the shelter
We just ripped that off
to tide it here and then well leave it there
But this time we have this
Last night we were shivering cold
and wanted to die
So would you rather be warm and dry or cold and wet?
Put a zip tie here
Tie a rope to that zip tie there
We can use that to push us up so we get even more room
Im thinking why dont I make a really big clothesline and hang up
all our wet stuff?
Maybe well have dry towels by tomorrow
I want to die
Im sunburned tired dehydrated and did I say tired?
After fixing camp we were so exhausted
that we spent most of the day sleeping
But at least when we woke up
we were reunited with a familiar friend
Bryan!  Bryan! Bryan!
Bryan!  Bryan!
Bryan come back!
After being stuck in a raft for five days with these guys
This really is a nightmare
Ill admit it
I missed Bryan  Hes moved on
You may not have given up on Bryan but Bryan gave up on you
Bryans given up on us
We have two days left Were running out of food
Our water is contaminated and were all borderline dying
Im going crazy
These last two days will be interesting
What could go wrong now?
I can literally see 500 fish down there
That is crazy
Oh my gosh This poop bucket stinks
I almost had a mental breakdown last night
I was shivering wet the entire time
Could not sleep
It was one of the worst nights of my life
Last night shivering in the torrential rain
in the middle of the deep dark ocean
You know we got through it
Now the end of this challenge could not come soon enough
Making the challenge 7 days was a horrible decision
This is so much harder
The new reinforced waterproof fortress actually worked
Lannan said
it rained last night did it?
At 4 am sprinkled a little
Hey heres the beauty
I didnt even know
That was the best sleep Ive ever gotten
I actually got a full nights sleep last night
I can barely even open my eyeballs
I would say this is the hardest challenge weve ever done
adding the extra five days on the end of a 50 hour challenge
definitely makes it harder
The fact that were just drifting at sea
on this hunk of wood thats pretty impressive
And while it seemed like the rain was over
we found ourselves encountering a new obstacle
Weve gone from shivering cold like two nights ago
to being scorching hot unbelievably hot
Im about to jump in the water because Im getting too hot
Were going to go swimming
I hope Nolan can swim
And while they cooled off in their own way
we got creative with ours
Oh yes
Its fans Cold air
I feel amazing
A jellyfish bit me!
Why does the ocean hate us?
I knew it was a great idea not to go swimming
Are you okay?  Oh my leg!
I found the sweet spot
Oh no
Yeah I got a little welts and some red lines
For the majority of the day it was so hot
we literally couldnt walk on the deck
Yeah Im hot
I dont want to be alive Im hot
Its very hot
But as the sun went down we were optimistic
about reaching the finish line
We have less than 24 hours left in the challenge
This has genuinely been
the hardest challenge video Ive ever been a part of
Honestly this whole experience has made me appreciate
all the things we take for granted in life
Like your shower your food
I miss food
A working toilet
I never want to poop in a bucket again
I say we celebrate making it this far with a Feastable bar
Yes available in every Walmart Target 7Eleven Albertsons
in America Its 2023
If youre still buying Hersheys its kind of lame
Hersheys for the boomers
Oh Jimmy  How did you break the chair?
what is happening?
Jimmy Im starting to think you ate all the food
I guess Ill just continue the timelapse with a broken chair
This is our final night sleeping together everybody
Oh Im so glad to sleep alone
Im gonna miss sleeping by your side
100 I would not rather sleep next to any other man
And with that Im going to bed
After an amazing nights sleep we were visited by a familiar face
Bryan brought his family to say goodbye to us on the last day
Thank you Bryan That meant a lot
Its almost like we were family to Bryan
We were
He kept us safe during like the night we had the least shelter
Maybe hes just a pea brain bird
Shut up  Nolan Off the rack
I wish  That was emotional
Everythings going full circle
We had so many crazy memories in this raft
Yeah and I think my best memory is going to be leaving
We spent over 150 hours on this floating piece of wood
And even though it was easily the hardest thing Ive ever done
the boys and I still had some good times
Wheres this boat?  Wheres the boat?
The boat!
Then finally the end was literally in sight
The boat its coming!
Alert the ship of our location
Signaling the boat!
Boat! Boat! Boat!
Why is it moving so abnormally slow?
Oh my God!  Im getting off this raft
