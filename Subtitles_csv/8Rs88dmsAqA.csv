English
Hi Guys Whats up? Thanks a lot for watching Booxoul
Today we are going to talk about
Teri Bhais ki pooch Your Buffalos tail
Ant sant mat Bol Dont talk Rubbish
types of words
In English we call these informal phrases SLANGS
In our country thats India
almost everyone wants to speak English as fluent as they can
but what happens is
while speaking we run out words!
I cant increase your vocabulary in this short video
even if it was a bit lengthier I couldnt because
umm my vocabulary sucks!
So like Teri Bhaiss ki pooch doesnt mean Buffalos tail in English
Similarly there are some words some slangs
which means a bit different than what they seem
So lets see them!!!
The first slang is SICK
We all know what SICK means in general
when someone is ill or something like that
but in English as a Slang it means a bit different
In English as a slang it means that something is very amazing or excellent
for example
She looks sick in that Dress
and I overacted
We just went to Nikhils Party last night I mean it was SICK! I wanna go back again
and I overacted again!!!
The 2nd slang is bingewatch
Dont we all sometimes watch the whole season at once?
Watching one episode after other and again and again
That is what known as bingewatch
For example
I just bingewatched 13 reasons why and I love that show now!
The 3rd slang is ButtDial
Sometimes accidentally we call someone on our phone while its inside our pocket or while sitting
So that call thats an accident is known as buttdial
For example
Hey I think you buttdialed me yesterday
You called me and then it was just noise
The 4th slang is BAIL
We all have heard of this word BAIL at least in Bollywood movies
Someones inside jail? Lets bail him out
But in English its a bit different
In English it means Leaving suddenlyAbrubtly
Suppose you go with your friends to watch cinema and then you realized
Oh FK! I forget to do the homework!!!
So youll say
Hey guys Im sorry Im gonna bail!
The 5th slang is Feeling Blue
It simply means to feel sad
If Im saying that Im feeling blue that means Im feeling sad
The 6th slang is by the skin of my teeth
In Hindi we can phrase it as Baal Baal Bache
For example
I managed to pass my exam by the skin of my teeth
The 7th slang is couchpotato
Couchpotato is a person who sits on the sofa all day and does nothing!
Like a friend of mine
So thats all guys!!!
