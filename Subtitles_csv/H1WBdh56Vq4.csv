Slab City is a community
located in the middle of the desert
It has no electricity no running water
and no law enforcement
Out of curiosity
me and the boys decided to spend 24 hours in the slabs
So were getting close to Slab City
and as you see theres roads and stuff
And then once we take this turn its nothing
No buildings no nothing
So were on the outskirts of Slab City
This right here is Salvation Mountain
Its a tourist attraction
and they recommend you dont go any further that way
It says keep out Chandler
It says
Ah I guess theres no laws
So were at the top of Candy Mountain
and Slab City is that way a little bit more
And yeah guys
So we discovered this cave and it has art on the walls
Im not doing it Im not going in
Chandler go in
Go in! Go!
This looks like something
out of a horror video game

Yeah Werent they having a fight about food or something?
Yeah I think thats the reason
why theyre playing  Oh
So are we all dressed up
and ready to go to the party?  We are
And we were just thinking that going to this party
is the weirdest thing weve ever done
Except for the time we all sat in a circle
Or the time we were in straightjackets
in the insane asylum
What about the time we counted to a hundred thousand?
Oh that was just me  I went to Ohio
Thats pretty crazy
That old man with the beard came over here
and told us theres a party
Wait the old man told us about the party
Yeah  Oh great
Its my kind of party
We scoped it out with the drone
It looks pretty good
It was lit up  Yeah
And there was empty seats
Apparently it was a show or like a open mic
And there was lights
So yeah were going  Thats all it takes
Lights?  We like lights
Baby I cant sleep
I just signed up for the open mic here
and Im gonna try to do some stand up comedy
If Im doing bad just get the car ready
I was actually born in Saudi Arabia
Do you guys know where that is?
Yeah  Yeah
First memory was that all the women there dressed the same
They covered everything except their eyes
My second memory was that I kept losing my mom
in retail stores
Thank you guys so much
Thank you for letting me doing this
I appreciate it
To be honest I was not expecting this
Theres kinda like a community
and everyone here just seems super chill
They were playing a lot of music
that I really enjoy and love
I had no clue that something like this
was gonna be just randomly in the middle of the desert
For a place with no laws
this is actually pretty chill
And its kinda like a community
everyones getting along
Im just kind of surprised
in the middle of the desert you have this
Theres a lot of different people out here you know?
This is awesome
I honestly didnt expect this
I didnt wanna come here in the first place
but this crazy
You wanna go dance Ill donate
I cant  Lets go do it
Out in stormy weather
All right boys
Im staying here
Im gonna live here  No
Garret you wouldnt last five seconds out here
Weve been out here for 24 hours dude
Yeah you wouldnt last five more seconds out here
Yeah youre right
All right  Oh I was right
Garrets gone
What if threeknife guy comes back?
What if you literally just popped up
right behind you and grabbed you by the throat?
I mean its my time to go
and get stabbed with three rusty knife
Im sorry dude
If youre listening we dont mean this
I thought you said
you wanted to live here man
Yeah I talked to some of the locals
They denounced threeknife men
They dont like him  No they dont like him
Chris wanted to go up on stage and dance with somebody
I didnt wanna go on stage you liar
But he cant dance so he chickened out
and now were making fun of him for it
Wow Great playbyplay
Who are you? Joe Madden
Oh my goodness
Chandler you might as well just walk
into the abyss after that one
All right See you guys
Im outta here
So the boys dont understand how this works
You cant just approach to Slab City
and just be like Yo dance with me
They have to accept you
And so he was  You cant dance
You dont know if he was vibing with me or not man
You just cant dance  You cant dance
Oh God no  Stop it man
Honestly dont care if Chris can or cant dance
but I just like making fun of him
So its really funny that he didnt dance
Im gonna be honest
Chris is starting to get arrogant
cause he built the tents
It happens every time
I was told to talk about how Chris didnt dance
Haha Chris
He wont do it cause he cant dance either
Yeah I know
Thats literally what I was thinking
Why would I make fun of him when I cant dance?
So Im in the tent and Im not gonna lie
I feel exhausted
Its been a pretty fun day
Im gonna go to bed soon
All right guys its been a long day
Im pretty tired
Okay God is telling me to go to sleep
It was a crazy experience but its time for bed
So peace out
I think Im gonna hit the hay
Im not gonna lie
Im not feeling too well
Im gonna go ahead and go to bed
Ill see you guys tomorrow
I am not feeling too good
Im really sick
I think I need to go to like the doctor or something
You guys look cute spooning together though
Scoot off
Seriously Im feeling really bad
I think I might have a fever  What happened?
Well get you some meds
and well get you to
Chris is apparently sick even worse now
So we gotta go take him to the doctor
Yeah I get kidney stones really bad
Ive had three within like the last year
