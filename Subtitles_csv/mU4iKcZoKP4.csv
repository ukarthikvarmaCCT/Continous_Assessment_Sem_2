Hello friends!
Its been two weeks since the IsraelPalestine war started
And now the situation in Gaza is no less than h3ll
Since 9th October
Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza
This means food supply of medicines
water and even electricity
has been cut off by Israel in Gaza
On top of that the continuous bombardment is unimaginable
The scenes coming out of Gaza are shocking
Look at this footage
Entire neighbourhoods have been reduced to rubble
These were the Gazan buildings that were targeted by Israel
Estimates show that
more than 2800 Palestinian civilians have been klld
Thousands are still trapped in this debris
The ones who are still alive are trying to get shelter in hospitals and schools
But by 16th October
water was also running out in the  United Nations shelters too
The United Nations agency UNRWA said on 15th October that
they are witnessing an unprecedented human catastrophe in Gaza
Mehmood Matar a surgeon working in Gaza
told BBC that hospitals are completely overwhelmed
There is no water no electricity
and the network connection is also unstable
He said that he was looking for water
Another doctor working at Naseer Hospital in Gaza said that
fuel is also going to run out
There are 60 patients on dialysis
35 patients are in ICU
they need ventilators
If fuel runs out it will not be possible to save them
And this isnt in only one hospital
Its the same everywhere
On 17th October health officials said that
the only oncology hospital in Gaza
would be shut down within 48 hours
if the situation continues like this
And all cancer patients
will be left without critical care
Take a look at the map of Gaza friends
It is a small place
This strip is spread over just 365 km
If you compare it with the size of New York
you will realize how small it is
Even if you compare it with Delhi
it is almost 14th of the size of Delhi
In this small area 23 million people live
This is one of the most densely populated places in the world
Even before the war began
the living conditions here were very bad
The people who lived here
were constantly under Israeli surveillance
and could not even travel beyond Gaza without Israels permission
It is also important to mention that
out of the 23 million population
almost half of the population are children
You heard it right
This is the reason why according to the estimates
out of all the people klld in this war
60 of them were the women and children living in Gaza
But the situation was so bad even before the war began that
those criticising Israel called Gaza an openair prison
As if the place is an open jail
On 7th October Hams attacked Israel
which started this war
But in response
Israel is continuously attacking Gaza
By putting a total blockade on Gaza
due to which not only Hams members are being klld
but also Palestinian civilians
And now Gaza has turned into hll
People say that
dolling out collective punishment like this to the people of Gaza
Israels action is no less than trrrism
The Norwegian Foreign Minister said that
it is unacceptable to impose a total blockade
At least humanitarian aid such as medicine and food should be allowed in Gaza
United Nations SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres had a similar opinion
Israel should allow humanitarian aid in Gaza
and Hams should release Israeli hostages without any conditions
Imagine in such circumstances
if you were a common person living in Gaza
what would you have gone through?
You dont have electricity water
internet connection is cutoff
you cant get food from anywhere
And then one day
you suddenly see some pamphlets falling from the sky
On those pamphlets there is a warning from Israel
In the warning it is written that
all the people living in the north of the Gaza Strip
should evacuate and
go to the south of the Gaza Strip
You can hear the sound of bombardment all around
And now you are being warned
to vacate your house as soon as possible
and go to the south if you want to survive
According to the estimates
about 11 million people live in Northern Gaza
The IDF warned everyone
to evacuate and go to the South
The shelters of the United Nations in Northern Gaza
were no longer safe
Anyone could be targeted in Northern Gaza
the hospitals schools or even clinics
The UNRWA pointed out
that many pregnant women children and elderly people
would not be able to move
Where will they go?
How will they evacuate?
On top of that the World Health Organization
strongly condemned Israels orders
There are 22 hospitals in northern Gaza
which have more than 2000 patients
How will hospitals be evacuated?
Despite this the Israeli military said that
around 600000 Gazans
evacuated from the northern area to the south
500000 people did not evacuate
but lets assume that you were among those who evacuated to the south
But does this mean you will be safe from the bombings?
Our people that were klld or injured
during these aerial strikes
in their homes in Deir al Balah
which is located in Southern Gaza
We witnessed instances
of airstrikes in Central Gaza
where the homes of many families were destroyed
People living in Southern Gaza arent safe either
Khan Yunis a city in Southern Gaza had to suffer through multiple airstrikes
A BBC correspondent confirmed the air strike in southern Gaza
a building near the Rafah crossing was damaged indeed
According to the correspondent
Israel hit the area near the Rafah crossing point at least thrice
This area is very important
Look at this place carefully
Rafah border crossing
This is the border crossing between Gaza and Egypt
If there is no safe place in Gaza
people will obviously think of leaving Gaza
On one side there is the sea where you cannot go
On two sides there is the country of Israel where you obviously cannot go
So the only place that you can flee to
is Egypt in the south
And there is only one border crossing here
The Rafah border crossing
So what would you have done in such a situation?
To escape the bombardment
you would have tried to flee Gaza
Thousands of people tried to do this
so they gathered at the Rafah border
But Egypt is not ready to open this border
Egypt and other Arab countries say that
it is unacceptable for Palestinian refugees to go to their countries
because the Palestinians have their own country
They cannot be thrown out of their own country
In the midst of all this
the danger of the war escalating is also rising
because clashes were seen in Israel and Lebanon
North of Israel is Lebanon
where the Hzbollh militant group operates
Like the Hams group
Hzbollh is also backed by Iran
and there has already been a war between Hzbollh and Israel
in 2006 which lasted for a month

And now lets get back to the topic
What has happened now is that
in the last few days
there has been a brief rcket firing between Hzbollh and Israel
On 16th  October an antitank missile was fired from Lebanon
which fell on a town in northern Israel
and injured three people
Israel has ordered its civilians
to evacuate the area near the Lebanon border
The biggest threat here is that
Hzbollh is actually more dangerous than Hams
and more powerful
They have lakhs of rckets and missiles
which can attack anywhere in Israel
On top of that Iran has also warned Israel
that if Israel tries to do a ground invasion in Gaza
that is if it deploys its army to Gaza on the ground
it can get a response from other places
It should also be noted here that
around 900 Indian troops
are stationed at the IsraelLebanon border
They are a part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
Our Indian troops have been stationed there since 1978
On 15th October it was reported that
a rcket shell fell near the site in southern Lebanon
Thankfully no casualties were reported
It is still a big mystery
how could Hams collect more than 5000 rckets in Gaza
and how was Israel completely unaware of it?
In the last video I said that
Egypt had already warned Israel that
an attack was imminent
Later it was found that
America also had information about it
and they also warned Israel too
There was an update on 28th September
by multiple streams of intelligence that
Hams can launch rcket attacks across the border
On 6th October one day before the attack
American officials circulated a report
that Hams was showing unusual activity
And an attack could happen at anytime
A Middle Eastern diplomat in Washington DC told CNN
that his government
was repeatedly warning the White House and thw US intelligence officials
that there was a buildup of weapons by Hams
He also said that
they have so many weapons in Gaza
that it was beyond anybodys imagination
So obviously the question arises
did the Israeli government already know about this attack
and they did nothing?
Here take a look at Israels internal politics as well
I had talked about this in this video
For the past few years
Israels politics has been quite unstable
Many elections were held
and the current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
has been charged with fraud
breach of trust and
taking bribery in three different scandals
Allegations are that billionaires have given him money
He denies this
but a corruption trial is going on
against Netanyahu which include
Cases 1000 2000 and 4000
These trials are pending
I told you in this video
how Prime Minister Netanyahu
is trying to interfere with the judiciary
He is trying to change this process
of how judges are selected
Citizens in Israel were out on the streets
there were nationwide protests in Israel a while back
Here you might recall the same lines of Rahat Indori
Is there a lot of tension at the borders?
Find out if the election is around the corner
Since the start of this war
Netanyahu has used emergency powers
to keep his position secure
Had this war not happened
and the corruption trial against him went on as scheduled
would he have had to resign from his Prime Ministerial position?
Thats another important question
Apart from this another allegation that is being put on Netanyahu is that
he tried to encourage the Hams group in the past
On one hand there was the great Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
whom I talked about in the video on IsraelPalestine history
He tried unrelentingly to bring peace between Israel and Palestine
The peace process was almost over
when a fanatic shot him
On the other hand what did Netanyahu do?
He leads a rightwing government
with the chestthumping approach
He divided the power between Gaza Strip and West Bank
He ignored the legitimate Palestinian Authority and President
And Hams a trrrist organisation
he tried to negotiate with them indirectly through Egypt
Look at this article in The Telegraph
How Benjamin Netanyahu empowered Hams
and broke Israel
This 18th October article
from the Times of Israel
For years Netanyahu propped up Hams
Now its blown up in our faces
It states that according to several reports
Netanyahu had said that
they should facilitate transfer funds to Gaza
so that there can be a separation
between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank
and Hams in Gaza
He said that this gap would ensure
that a Palestinian state will never be formed
An extreme rightwing politician from his political party
had made a statement in 2015
that Israels policy is to treat the Palestinian Authority as a burden
and treat Hams as an asset
The Israeli government allowed
suitcases with millions of dollars from Qatar to enter Gaza
to benefit Hams in 2018
These may seem shocking to you
but the majority of the Israeli public already knows about these things
Because thankfully the Israeli media
is still free
It does not sit in their governments lap
This is the reason why according to the latest polls
the approval rating of Netanyahu has been falling rapidly
since the war started
According to a recent poll
only 29 of the Israelis
support Netanyahu now
This has reached an alltime low
Israel is now witnessing protests
against Netanyahus government
People are venting their anger on Netanyahu
With placards in their hands
Bibi you have bl00d on your hands
Go to jail Bibi
In another incident an angry mob
shouted at the Israeli Cabinet Minister
outside a hospital
And the minister had to go back
That person said
now its time for them to take control
Them as in Israeli civilians
Thats why I say
never have blind faith in any government organization or group
Always take the side of humanity
and think about the common people
Whether they are the common people living in Israel
or the common people living in Gaza

from a few months ago
when Netanyahu tried to take over the judiciary
Thank you very much!
