MrBeast You guys spammed me to plant 20 million trees
on Twitter Reddit all over my comment section
So I made it happen
Today we will be planting 20 million trees
And we put em in the hole
Now we need mulch
Put the mulch around the tree
and we hydrate it
And there we go bell dings
And again
Hole tree mulch water
And before we go any further this is Sarah
Shes a tree planting expert
Will this tree grow to be big and healthy?
Im gonna look and see if I can pull on it
and it doesnt pull out of the planting hole
triumphant jingle So good job there
Only 19999980 more trees
Lets go!
all cheer Yeah!
Oh yeah  Sturdy?
Oh very sturdy bell dings
You could tug on this with a rope
and it wouldnt come out bell dings
Chris I need help Can you massage my tree for me?
Massage your tree?
I cant get it out of this pot
Dude its like rock solid in here
There you go bell dings
So talking to trees makes them grow faster?
Grow! What do you want the planet to die come on
Grow  Can you grow!
Do you see the sky? Its so beautiful
Youre gonna be a house for birds and stuff
hands whacking
You got toughen these trees up
Look at this No movement
So the reason were spacing the trees eight feet apart
is so the roots have to grow out
and they dont have to compete
Its kind of weird to put mulch around a growing tree
cause its grinding up all of its relatives
and spreading it around them
upbeat music
All right well its started to rain
At least now we dont have to water the trees
No but seriously we wanna plant 20 million trees
and a little bit of rain never hurt anyone
If a tree falls in the woods
and no ones around to hear it does it make noise?
Yes Its still a tree
Cameraman Plant a tree in the middle of the forest
Hold on Ive gotta do something important
Oh okay Timber! explodes
Why are you mad?
What is this?
bells dings
Its a hole  With a tree in it
Look at this tree!
Look jeans squelching
You see that?
man screaming
upbeat music
After planting all day
we only managed to plant 300 trees
Which is less than 20 million and my back hurts
I put out a tweet and I have tons of people
coming here tomorrow to plant trees
I think Ive got an idea for a drone
So I havent mentioned this yet but this is Mark Rober
This is his channel
He used to work at NASA he put this thing on Mars
He does a lot of cool things
Hes gonna try with the drone
and were gonna try with people
Play to your strengths
May the the alright
Its day number two and we brought a lot more people
crowd cheering
And now were gonna try to plant the 20 million trees
So step one is we need to give everyone their tree
Can I have a fist bump?  Yes
Oh my God
Heres your tree  I shall name him Russell
Look at all these people
Were easily gonna hit 20 million
electronic upbeat tune
And now its time to begin
Lets plant the trees
crowd cheering Unless youre him
He already planted it
Youre doing great  Great good job
Do you need help?
If you would like to help go for it
Dig right here seems like the best spot
The holes too big
dramatic music
Tree review rock music
See the tug test?
You dont want any oxygen in the root system
or the tree wont survive
What are these people doing?
Thats a solid tree
Thats a solid boy?  Thats a solid tree
Okay good  Thats great
Whoever planted that amazing
upbeat music
Make sure you want to do a donut

Thats a good tree man  Good job Chris
Dude thanks  Got em!

He gets a high five you know whatever
The last tree  Thanks Chandler
As you can see there are a ton of trees here
Now we actually grabbed a drone shot beforehand
So heres the drone shot of the empty field
Look at it Its empty
And heres the drone shot now Is that a lot of extra trees?
Yes its quite extra
We had to Yeah
Unfortunately despite having a large number of people
we came nowhere near close to planting 20 million trees
But I dont wanna let you guys down
So I devised a plan
where we can actually plant 20 million trees
but I need your help
We partnered with the largest nonprofit
tree planting organization in the world Arbor Day
But we need your help
Every dollar donated they will plant a tree Watch
Heres a dollar and I donated it
Another dollar another tree
Heres 10 and I just donated it
bell dings
This is 30 and guess what happens when I donate it?
bell dings
Even Chandler can do it
Another one
Another one
And another one
Arbor Day and their partners are the pros
Theyve planted hundreds of millions of trees
theyll make sure they have a high rate of survivability
and they genuinely do care
If you donate a dollar
something like this ends up in the ground
And given enough time this will turn into this masterpiece
Now one thing I want to address
I personally havent always been
the most environmentally friendly
Weve burnt the box for it
and weve done many other dumb things
And a lot of you might be of the mindset of the old me
That was basically someone else will figure it out
But thats not how it works
We genuinely need all the help we can get
And honestly Ive done everything I can
I got a bunch of fans together
and we planted thousands of trees
Me and mark have invested months of time behind the scenes
into getting this all together
And Im personally planting a hundred thousand trees
AKA a hundred thousand dollars donation
Ive literally tried my best to do everything I can
And now its your guys turn
You guys have been spamming my comment section
and spamming my mentions on Twitter
telling me to do something
And now I wanna see that same energy
We only have one earth
and its important we take care of it
Recently lots of not so great things
have been happening to forests
and people just keep making fun of our generation
for retweet activism and not actually doing something
Which is why we created teamtreesorg
with the help of the Arbor Day Foundation
This is your chance to make a difference
For every dollar you donate here on YouTube
or at teamtreesorg a tree will be planted
And the Arbor Day Foundation
are really good at what they do
These trees will have
an extremely high rate of survivability
Please donate now
Dont push it off till later you might forget
This is our chance to show the world we care
Teamtreesorg donate there
or donate using the donate button below the video
Thank you
