Friends when you imagine the Middle East
you probably think of deserts
But Oman is quite special
It has date palm forests
and tall mountains
Here you can swim with turtles
and in Oman you can also see
one of the most dangerous forts in the world
A fort that could never be breached by an enemy
Because its defence system was so immaculate
that youll be shocked to see it
The security system of this fort
was truly amazing back then
If you tried to enter the fort from this gate
the soldiers could throw rocks from above to k!ll you
So even before you enter
you can see the first post
from where they would throw rocks on you
If you escape this
you will reach the Pitfall 1
where they would throw hot oil or date syrup on you
The date syrup
Thats where the hot oil would be poured on you
So you better be quick to escape it
Now theyve covered this with glass
or else you could have fallen into the pit
When you would run from the hot oil
you would fall into this pit
And if you escaped it too
you would reach the Pitfall 2
They could drop something from here
the Mrder Hole 2 is right above it
You could fall into this pit and perish
Catch enemies off guard
in the dark passageway
It was dark
there were no lamps like here
So some of the stairs had wooden planks
that could be removed to expose
deep gaping pits
And then you would be at the third pitfall
And the fourth after that
And the fifth
So not just once but
you would have to escape five times
if you want to breach this fort
Weve safely escaped 2 pitfalls
Lets move on to the third pitfall
Oh! This is the third pitfall
As soon as you open this door
you have this door here
as soon as you step through it  youll fall into the pitfall
Theres a door before every pitfall
These people were so clever
the doors would be closed
and when you try to open the doors
they will pour oil on you
and if you manage to open it
you will fall into the pit
And after passing through all these stages
I dont know if there has  been a single intruder in history
who reached the top
If he did
this is the view he would have seen
These are the places
from where you would pour the hot oil
It can really go deep inside
300 years ago
Nizwa was the capital of Oman
Thats why today
Nizwa is an important tourist attraction
The city of Nizwa
And this fort
back then the Sultan of Oman
lived here and ruled over Oman
The best thing about Oman
in comparison to the other Middle Eastern countries
is that this is a sparsely populated country
Wherever you go there wont be a crowd
Youll see very few people
So you can take your time to explore everything
Like you can see the fort
this is a major tourist attraction
but you can hardly see anyone else here
Im the guy who has been assigned
the duty of throwing the stones today
Oh youre throwing the stones today?
On the intruders
Okay Ill be the one who pours the oil then
Ill be over here okay?
The wood on the door
this is the same wood from those days
This is walnut wood
Even in their shooting style
they had some nice designs
Like if someone was close to the fort
and they had to shoot him
this is the slit theyd use
so that they could shoot downwards
But if the target was far
this is the hole for that
they could shoot from here
And theres another angle here
So they could shoot in three different angles
These 3 angles were all around 360 of the fort
So you can imagine the
level of protection of this fort
Theres a well in this castle fort
Look at how deep it goes
You can see my reflection at the bottom
Oh my God Zoom in
This is a big area
that includes the Nizwa Souq Nizwa Fort
a historical wall
that was used to protect the fort from enemies
Were walking on this wall now
You can see some old buildings here
some parts are being renovated
some have been renovated already
But look at how extraordinary it looks
It feels like you have timetravelled  to 2000 years into the past
Dont be distracted by my cap
theres Australia written on it
I wore this because I didnt have any other caps
And its too sunny here
And if you remember the Australia vlogs
I got this cap for free in Australia
so Im wearing this cap
After this we went to the Nizwa Souq
The old city market
that looks like a historical place
Omani dates
Look at the varieties here
Less sweets ones okay
There are dates everywhere
You will know the difference  between this one and that
This ones good right? I like this
I think this is the fourth variety Ive tried
At home mostly we have the Medjool ones
There are more than 200 varieties of dates in Oman
They have so many types of dates in this shop
Youll be exhausted by the time youve tried them all
They have seedless dates
date honey
and the tahini sauce to dip the dates
This machine is making sesame sauce
The sesame seeds are put into it
And this machine is grinding the seeds
to make the sauce
You can see it here
And the sauce then drips into this pot  where it is collected
Oh wow theres so much sauce
You can smell it also
They have given us this sample to try
Pure tahini sauce
It is warm!
The contrast between  this sauce and the dates
tastes quite good
because it tastes a bit sour
and the dates are sweet
So when the tastes mix
it makes a good snack
So we decided to buy 1 packet of dates
But they actually gifted it to us
They would not accept any payment
Very very sweet
Though it was pretty affordable to be honest
0800 Rial 208 or 17235
800 Baiza
A Rial is divided into 1000 Baiza
This dagger that you see here
this is the logo of Oman
Even on Omans flag
theres a dagger in a corner
In ceremonies and special occasions
people carry such daggers

So this is a banana  and a palm tree plantation
You can see were walking on the irrigation system
so we dont wanna step on anything
There are no dates on any of these trees
but when they are they look like this
They grow in bunches
There can be more than a thousand dates in a bunch
Omans population is less than 5 million
But there are more than 7 million date palm trees
Can you imagine that
there are more date trees  than people in this country?
There was a small hill here
The view from here is simply amazing
You can see the date palm tree  plantation spread over this area
And behind it you can see  some interesting historical civilisations
We finished checking into the second hotel now
and as soon as we entered the room
look at what we found
A huge YouTube cake
Welcome to Al Bustan Palace
Thats the name of this hotel
And they have my latest photo on  top of this YouTube cake
Probably edible
And the Play Button Subscribe
wait a second Dislike?
No no no lets remove the Dislike
Dislike also? We dont need it here
These cakes look really interesting
They look really good
But unfortunately its not  possible to eat so much sugar
its just too much
If you take an hourlong speedboat ride from Muscat
you will reach Al Daymaniyat Island
It is a protected nature reserve
and a wonderful site for ecotourism
So were on the beautiful island now
Were the only ones on this island
The only ones? Look theres no one else around here
Were about to go snorkelling Yeah
Theres a small problem
Someone one of us I wont say who
forgot their swimming pants
So they have to go in undie
Underwater youll find more than  100 species of corals
more than 280 species of fish
but if the thing this place is most famous for
are the turtles
The endangered species of green turtles
often come here to nest
and while snorkelling
these turtles can get very close to you
In this video you can see
that they arent scared of humans
Now were at a special museum in Oman
The building is so unique that
Im in a sciencefiction movie
Not in 2024 but in 2124
It looks so crazy
Look behind you
This building feels like its AIgenerated
Its so perfect
Everything looks so proper
you wont even find a single  dust particle on this floor
This is the biggest museum in Oman
Oman Across the Ages
The museum building is so huge that
there is more than 900000 m of exhibition space here
And in some galleries the ceiling is so high
some are more than 20m high
The huntergatherers who lived in Oman 6000 years ago
lived in such huts
These are some historical  Omani sea routes over here
Look at this the screen is so big
but there are gaps between the screen
To go further into the museum
you can pass through the gaps in the screen
This museum has been designed very creatively
Theres another screen on the other side
Friends here you can clearly see
the Omani national emblem
That has two swords and a dagger
This is the passport of Omans previous Sultan
You can see it
Along with his Drivers License and ID Card
You can see the number on the ID Card
Most of the things that you saw in this vlog
were from around Muscat
But apart from this in Oman you can see deserts
the highest mountain in the Gulf
as well as the Gulfs Grand Canyon
We showed the Grand Canyon in the previous vlog
