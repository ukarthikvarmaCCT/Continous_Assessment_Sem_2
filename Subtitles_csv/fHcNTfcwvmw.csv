Today I went to Tech Burners studio
Bro the studio is so big that   we had to use hoverboard here
to go from one side to another
Then on the way I saw Tech   Burners 5 lakh rupees dog
It had a camera in its nose
It had too many  sensors in the mouth
And brother it was showing   it by doing different tricks
And this is the first dog in my life
whom I slapped and it  did not bite me poor dog
Then I saw this red camera   which is usually used in movies
To lift it first I had to make   body with dumbbells
because it was too heavy
Even its price was equally heavy
Rs65 lakh
And this 100TB server was to   keep the big footage of this
Then I did the first collab of my life   with Tech Burner
Overall I learned a lot   and had a lot of fun
One more thing is too fun
