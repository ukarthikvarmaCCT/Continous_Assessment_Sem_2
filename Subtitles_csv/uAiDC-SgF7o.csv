Hello friends
If you remember in 2017
the video of Paytms CEO and founder  Vijay Shekhar Sharma went viral
You could see the excitement
as he was celebrating Paytms success
He famously said
Those who are not with us will cry
But sadly 7 years later
the situation has completely changed
Those who are with Paytm are crying
Over the last few days we saw  a horrific crash of this company
On 30th January the stock price of this company was at 760
Today it has fallen below 380
What is the reason behind this?
Lets understand the rise and downfall of Paytm
in this video
Paytm began its journey in 2010
But initially it was just a mobile recharging platform
An app through which you could
recharge your phone and pay landline bills
The company gradually added more features to its app
It was only in January 2014 that
Paytm Wallet was launched
With this you could pay online using Paytm
By 2015 it was possible to pay for metro  recharges electricity gas and water bills
But the real jump in the companys popularity
was seen only after 8th November 2016
That day when demonetisation happened
500 and 1000 currency notes
will no longer be legal tender  from midnight tonight
The very next day after demonetisation
the frontpage ads in many newspapers  across the country looked like this
Paytm congratulates Honourable  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi
on taking the boldest decision
in the financial history of independent India
Now no ATMs use Paytm
The first controversy about Paytm was raised here
People questioned whether
Paytm has any link with the government
Using the Prime Ministers face in this way
while advertising their platform
And the decision of demonetisation  which was said to be secretive
was declared on 8th November at 8pm
So how did it happen that the very next day
in the morning newspaper on 9th November
this was the front page ad?
Did this company already know that  demonetisation was going to happen?
Whatever happened one thing was clear
Paytm benefited a lot from this decision
According to Euro Moneys report before demonetisation
Paytm had 125 million customers
But only after 3 months of the demonetisation
Paytms had approx 185 million customers
The CEO of this company Vijay Shekhar Sharma
did not miss the opportunity to capitalise on this opportunity
Paytm hired more than 10000 agents
to distribute their QR codes  to local shops and vendors
Shopkeepers were encouraged in every city
to use Paytm
The company was growing tremendously
But around this time
there were 23 other controversies
One was Paytms Chinese link
In 2015 a Chinese company named Alibaba
invested 680 million in Paytm
and 40 stake in Paytm company
went to this Chinese company
Alibabas founder is Jack Ma
and Vijay had said that he was his hero
He had given a statement to the Financial Times newspaper
I became totally interested in China
Alibaba and Jack  all three things
You must be aware of the recent  relations between India and China
China is repeatedly intruding on the Indian border
In 2017 the Doklam border standoff took place
Many people had criticised Paytm for this
Claiming that the company pretends to be a patriot
when they want to sell something
But they have been taking Chinese funding secretly
Because of this criticism
the Chinese stake in the company was reduced
in 2023 Vijay transferred about 10 stake back to himself
and the Chinese stake in the company  is around 135 as of now
In May 2018 the next controversy arose regarding Paytm
when the investigative news agency CobraPost
conducted an undercover operation
Their undercover reporter
went to meet the Vice President of Paytm  Ajay Shekhar Sharma
Vijay Shekhar Sharmas brother
When he was asked
if he would spread the propaganda  of a political party through the app
he happily accepted
There will be videos of Guruji too
there are other things as well  I give those to you later
Well take care of all of that
if RSS tells us to
Because loyalty to RSS runs in our blood
He went on to say that
when the government asked them  for the data of some Paytm users in JK
during the stone peltings
they happily gave the data to the government
When our operations were shut down in JK
due to the stones The stone peltings yes
the PMO called us personally
asking us to hand over data to them
of the Paytm users
I made a video on this 6 years ago
if you remember  if you are a veteran viewer of my channel
But nothing significant happened with these controversies
The company kept growing very fast
Generally speaking
there are many companies who
dont care about your data
They sell your data to other companies
Especially online it happens a lot
Your data is used to create a digital profile
so that you can be shown online targeted ads
A good way to avoid this is to use VPN
A VPN encrypts your internet traffic
In my opinion one of the best VPN apps
is NordVPN
which is also the sponsor of this video
One of the advantages of using NordVPN is that
you can use it for content streaming
If a specific show movie or video  is banned in your location
you can bypass these restrictions
by setting your location somewhere else through VPN
Recently due to increasing customer demand
NordVPN has added a server in India
This is a virtual location server with Indian IP
And when you browse the internet with a VPN
your data is secure
You cant be tracked online by other companies

Now lets get back to the topic
In 2017 Paytm launched Paytm Payments Bank
They started offering banking services
Payments Bank is like a bank to some extent
You can create a bank account
deposit money and get a debit card
But compared to a normal commercial bank
there are some important differences
Payments banks focus mostly on digital services
There are very few  physical branches of payments banks
And according to RBIs Rules
payments banks cannot offer  credit card and loan services
Normal commercial banks  like HDFC SBI ICICI
do not have any deposit limit
You can deposit as much as you want in those banks
But RBI has prescribed a limit for payments banks
You cannot deposit more than 200000 in these banks
I am telling you all this in detail because
the current state of Paytm
is largely caused by Paytms Payments Bank
RBI the Reserve Bank of India
is the central bank of the country
It decides the monetary policy of the country
and also works to print money
All the banks and financial institutions in the country
have to follow the rules and  guidelines prescribed by the RBI
So on 31st January 2024
the Paytm crash
happened because the RBI
imposed operational restrictions  on Paytms Payments Bank
RBI said that Paytms Payments Bank
kept violating our rules repeatedly
There was persistent noncompliance by them
And thats why RBI put restrictions on the bank
After 29th February 2024
Paytms Payments Bank cant accept any new deposits
There cant be money topups in customer accounts
New customers cant be onboarded
And RBI said that all the nodal accounts
with this Paytm Payments Bank
should be closed by 15th March 2024
Nodal accounts are those accounts
which are used by ecommerce and online services businesses
And as far as Paytm Wallet is concerned
you can use your existing balance
but after 29th February
you cant deposit any more money in it
So obviously this is a major decision by the RBI
And such decisions are not taken in a jiffy
Its not like RBI randomly decided one day
to take action on Paytm
and implemented these decisions
In fact there is a very long history behind this
The truth is that Paytm was time and again
warned by the RBI for years
but it still didnt rectify its actions
In November 2017
Paytms Payments Bank was launched
and in June 2018
RBI issued the first warning
An audit found that Paytm
was not following the antimoney  laundering regulations properly
And the identity of the customers  who made their accounts with their bank
was not being verified properly by Paytm
The KYC or Know Your Customer compliance
wasnt adhered to by Paytm
So RBI told Paytm to stop onboarding new customers
until it fixes all these issues
Paytm took some action regarding this warning
because in January 2019
RBI allowed Paytm to resume onboarding customers
The restrictions were removed
But after 25 years in October 2021
came the next big shock
A fine of 10 million was imposed on Paytm
Because while filling in their licence application
they submitted incorrect information and documents
The issues that RBI had flagged before
customers not being verified properly
regulations are not being followed properly
the same issues were seen again
Once again customer onboarding had to be stopped
In October 2023 another huge fine was imposed on Paytm
this time it amounted to 50 million
RBI hoped that after 2 warnings and 2 fines
Paytm would meet the regulatory requirements
and start verifying its customers properly
But even after all this
Paytm did not take these seriously
And for this reason on 31st January 2024
RBI had to take concrete steps
Since Paytm could not follow  the rules and regulations properly
RBI had to stop its operations
RBIs findings were very shocking
According to CNBC
Paytm allowed hundreds of thousands of  customers to open bank accounts with them
without proper KYC documentation
There were thousands of cases where
thousands of customers  had opened multiple accounts
using the same PAN card
In some accounts transactions were worth
millions of rupees
Here the risk of potential money laundering was evident
It is possible that money laundering  was taking place through Paytm
Outlook reported that according to an analyst
Paytm had around 350 million wallets
Of which around 310 million wallets are inactive
no one is using these
And in the remaining 40 million wallets
most of them have no balance or very little balance
Because of this they can be used like mule accounts
A Mule account is an account
that is used for illegal activities
like money laundering
After this there are concerns about data privacy too
RBI said that Paytms parent company
One97 Communications Ltd
there is no operational segregation  between it and Paytm Payments Bank
There was cash flow between the two
which was not disclosed in the financial statements
So many rules and regulations were ignored
Is the arrogance of their CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma  responsible for this to some extent?
He gave many interviews to media channels
this arrogance was seen in his words in those interviews
If you fundamentally believe  that Paytm is 3 payment player
that is where the beginning of the problem is
in understanding
Im surprised that people dont know this
in this country but
we make profit so it is
Somebody who has not met us
and has an opinion on us
is not my opinion
to keep an opinion on that
After RBIs announcement on 31st January
a commotion broke out
People started taking out  the money they had invested in Paytm
So Paytms stock crashed very fast
To calm people down
Paytm posted on its social media handles that
there was nothing wrong
On 2nd February Vijay Shekhar Sharma tweeted this
To every Paytmer
Your favourite app is working
will keep working beyond 29th February as usual
For every challenge there is a solution
and we are sincerely committed to serve our nation
in full compliance
India will keep winning global accolades
in payment innovation and  inclusion in financial services
As you can see once again
patriotism was used as a shield here
Dont see us as a company
see us as patriots serving the nation
Using India as the shield
Paytm tried to hide behind it
This reminds me of a quote
Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel
You must have heard this quote
In my opinion we should be wary of such companies
which rely too heavily on nationalism
A few years ago there was a phone Freedom 251
They printed Indias national flag on the back of the phone
It was sold as the worlds cheapest phone
but it turned out to be a big scam
If a companys products and services
have intrinsic value
they sell it by promoting those values
But if they dont have much to say  about their products or services
then patriotism is used as a selling point
Urging you to buy their product
just because they are Indian
Because they are an Indian company
they use it as the only reason  why you should buy their product
Anyways if we come back to Paytm
the question is what will happen next?
Internally the employees of the company
are facing a lot of uncertainty
They are not getting much clarity from the leadership
about what will happen next
Economic Times reported that
an executive of the company told them that
their business model might change
Now instead of being a bank
they might try to become a thirdparty payments app
So they will have to change  some things on the back end
And they will have to make the change in a limited time
If you look at Paytms annual report
to check how much has it earned each year
you will see that it has always been
a lossmaking company since
its shares were listed on the stock market
Look at this chart
in FY 2021 the company incurred a loss of 16 billion
In FY 2022 a loss of 15 billion
In FY 2023 a loss of 17 billion
The good news was that year after year
the companys losses were decreasing
So it could have been expected that next year
that is this year in FY 2024
the company would earn its first profit
But now after everything that has happened
it seems difficult
The company expects that this year
the companys loss could increase by 3 billion to 5 billion
Paytm has revealed this to the public
saying that they will now comply  with the guidelines issued by RBI
But after this announcement
the companys stock price fell further
What is the path to profitability Vijay?
What is by when will Paytm make money?
Make more money?  By making more money
By making more money!
Vijay Shekhar Sharma will have to come up  with better answers to these questions
if he wants to convince people
Actually convincing people
will be the biggest challenge for Paytm
An average person is very picky about choosing a company
And publics trust plays an important role here
Once people choose their toothpaste
they decide that they will use  that companys toothpaste forever
They dont change their mind easily
Here they will be more cautious as this  involves their money and banking abilities
Bringing customers back
wont be easy for Paytm
But convincing customers will come later
First Paytm will have to convince RBI
That wont be an easy task
But there is light at the end of the tunnel
a way to get out of this can be
to have another company
buy Paytms wallet business
A Business Standard report suggests that
HDFC Bank and Jio Financial Services
might just do this
But Jio has denied this speculation
saying that they have no intention of doing so
And anyway before executing such a sale
theyd need RBIs approval
