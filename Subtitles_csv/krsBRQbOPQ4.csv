This is a 250 million private island
Literally anything you could ever want is on this island
And Im going to show you the difference
between this and a 150 million luxury island
a massive 45 million island a 5 million frozen island
all the way down to the cheapest private island in the world
That thing Im starting to realize might not all fit on it
First step on my brand new island
Heres your dollar
Thank you sir
Thank you for selling it to me  Its yours now buddy
Lets check out what I just bought
My first impressions
is that its a lot smaller than I thought
When you pay a dollar
you get a random pile of bricks an old toilet
I found the restroom
And a bunch of random wooden poles
Theres more poles than square feet on this thing
Theyre actually called pylons
Lets pile onto that boat and leave
And as you can see theres nothing here so Im going to blow it up
But later in this video were going to a 150 million island
and also a quarter billion dollar super island
But first were going to head over to the 1 million dollar island called
Monkey Island
Yes you heard me right
This island is literally swarmed with hundreds of monkeys
I can see why its called Monkey Island
Whats this monkey?  Its Odie
Odie took my orange
Monkey see food monkey take
All the monkeys on this island
have a strategy for interacting with people
They gaslight you into thinking
that youre friends and then they steal your food
You can have it You can have it
I love this monkey
Theres a monkey on the boat
And if youre wondering where are you
and your friends are going to sleep on this island
Suspended above the water are six luxury cabanas which house
both humans and monkeys
The monkeys grabbing the GoPro Jimmy
Sir we need this for filming
I just need to borrow this
Thank you Okay
I got my camera back You want Oops
He wants your hat
Okay you can have that sir
By the end of this Im going to be naked
The monkeys are stealing everything
And the monkeys are not even the coolest part of this island
See this island isnt even an island at all
Its actually the top of a massive underwater plant network
that emerged from the sand and water
to create this illusion of an island that we see today
Is this a milion dollar island or a million dollar bush?
Because theres no land  What do you think?
I dont know
I think an island is what you make of it
And on the other side of the island theres even a private relaxation area
And a beachfront massage parlor
Im trying not to fall in the water
Im about to get a massage with a monkey
Thats really cool
Notice how all the water around you is freezing
That took a lot of effort
And we put that much effort in to convey
that the 5 million Island is very cool
And where were going next most of the year looks like this
but its going to look like this
No joke
This island is so cold right now that the lake surrounding it
is actually frozen solid which means to get there
were going to be using an interesting vehicule
Were literally hovering
Apparently snowmobiles would have been too basic for this island
It just had to be hovercrafts
This is awesome
Talking about arriving in fashion
And it only took about 30 seconds
being outside the hovercraft for the gang to be frozen solid
How cold is it?  Its zero degrees celsius
Its pretty cold man
Hes more like a 70 guy
So they hurried over
to these futuristic selfheating huts to stay warm
Oh this is so small
Wait theres no room for you in here
Were gonna have to cuddle then
And these huts are able to stay here completely year round
because theyre able to both float on warm peaceful lake water
But they also do just fine in the dead of winter
But at least in the winter
you get a great view of the northern lights
For 5 million you basically get a winter wonderland
And while staying on this island
youre given unlimited five star food
I think he thinks we speak Finnish
And even though this island comes with a luxury cabin to stay in
Oh this is beautiful
Fine Ill take it
Jimmy buy it for me
The gang ended up spending most of their time on the frozen lake
where they were able to ride an actual dog sled
He took your glove
Oh my Gosh!
This is the best island
I dont know how any island is going to beat this
Maybe one where I could feel my hands
And Karls hands are in luck because this next island is not only warm
but more expensive than all of the other islands combined
This island is tiny but arguably one of the most
luxurious ones out there
Okay lets go check the house
Were stoked to have you as our guest
We hope you have a blast Just dont break anything
Yo we should try to break one thing
Oh nice bathroom
Usually rich people like showers that can fit like 30 to 1000 people in them
This time they chose a reasonable shower
When you pay 16 million
in addition to a shower thats the size of the 1 island
the private island comes with this helicopter
thats apparently too big for this island
We have jet skis
We have a submarine Another submarine to the right
We have a shark submarine over there
Theres almost a submarine for each of us
Boys do whatever you want Have fun Youre out You
Yeah! Yeah!
Im going really fast
I love private islands
Karl if you had one wish what would it be?
To get off of this thing!
Were underwater!
I am a fish now
After Ludwig and Karl kissed the sea at 500 miles per hour
we went back to shore to take a little breather
Ludwigs going to jump out of a helicopter
He really is
No wait Im not Wait what?
Any last words?
I love you Mom Im sorry
This helicopter
is taking the boys up into the air
and letting them jump and freefall into the ocean
Oh my God
This is crazy We shouldnt be doing this
This is only a 16 million island
and were jumping out of a helicopter
Hes about to jump
Oh my Gosh!
Oh wait! They jump!
There he goes
Whoever said money doesnt buy happiness
doesnt own that private island because Im pretty happy
And now the 45 million island
this island is so big you cant even fit it all in frame
Oh hey I didnt realize they were waiting on us
Hi!  Hi!
I always feel uncomfortable when I pull up to places
and people are just standing potentially for hours waiting on me
We have some blueberry smoothies here
Is it alcoholic?
No its not
Hes not 21
now well take you guys up and well show you around Royal Island
a little bit
Lets see what 45 million gets us
Its a long path
The path is longer than the last island
For 45 million
this island comes with a mansion and its own
beachside bar and private chef
Can I give it a flip?  Sure
Thats not too bad
And outside of the mansion is a hot tub
overlooking the cove where the jet skis are
and of course a pool with the best view Ive ever seen
Does this look as cool on camera as it does in real life?
And if for some reason you dont want to stay in the mansion
theres five luxury beachside cabanas you can pick from
Jimmy may I?
You may
May I?
You may
I have class
But even after messing around with all of the amenities
Why are we playing ping pong when we have an entire island?
Its important to note that thats not what makes this island special
All the way at the other end of
the island are centuryold ruins that we are yet to explore
Dibs on driving
Oh no
All right ready?
Were going to go off roading a little bit
and head to the back of the island now
How does Karl always end up driving?
Because Im awesome  Big bump!
Dude this is like a safari
Yeah youre going four times the speed limit
I mean I dont know if theres cops that will stop you
but Im just letting you know
Is there a jail on this island?
No Jail
Oh theres no jail?
And when we finally ran out of road to drive on
we started to make our way through
what used to be a village of people
on this island over a hundred years ago
This used to be a bar?  Yes
You want to walk under this 100yearold giant thousandpound slab?
Sure surely it wont fall on top of me
Dude if today was the day that itd fell you couldnt even be mad
Nolan come over here before you die
And just past the ruins is easily the best view on the entire island
Yeah it gets better
We were driving for so long
I forgot we were on an island
The island starts over there comes all the way around
wraps all the way around here
Goes down that coastline all the way up over there
Ill be honest I wouldnt
pay 45 million for a big jungle with some ancient ruins
But Im sure some rich guy will
This next island is arguably the second most expensive island
that money can buy
This is the 150 million island
It comes with eight luxurious mega mansions
And the best part is
it is completely powered by solar panels and wind turbines
Its home to some of the most exotic animals Ive ever seen
and took over four decades to build
This island will literally blow your mind
When I think of a private island this is what I think of
Thats good because this is a private island
All right
And apparently the first thing you need to do here is wash your hands
Make sure you dont taint the island with your outside world germs
Ive already washed my germs
Does everyone who come here gets a coconut?
I mean theyre not running low
I dont know if its because this place is so fancy
Or maybe they just heard about Karls driving
But each of us ended up with our own personal driver
I have a feeling this is going to be a onceinalifetime experience
Unless you come back  That might be out of my price range
And even though this island costs 150 million
you can actually rent it yourself
for the extremely low price of 140 grand per day
I didnt even realize we just went up a mountain
Ive heard this is the most luxurious private island in the world
It is
The view is insane  This is the great house
But before we were able
to explore the great house my dumb friends got distracted by a turtle
Theres a turtle?
Get in there
All right you guys go to the rest of the island
This island is so extra that for every one person
in your party they have ten staff members waiting on your every need
Theres a bunch of people over there like heres drinks heres food
What do you want to do over the next few days?
And were just like turtle
And of course
Nolan of all my friends wanted to take advantage of this
Yes! Yeah!
Whats everyone up to over here?
Were playing pool
With 10 people?
Theyre my hype crew
You dont have to hang out with him to make him feel good
I will be sad if you dont sit down and relax
If you need attention dont make them stand there
Its only been an hour but Ill say it
This is the best island so far
On top of all of that
the island has a house with a driving range on the roof
where you can literally hit golf balls into the ocean
Because these are made of fish food
You should probably hit it further so you dont hit someone
Look at all those flamingos Theres so much I cant process it
Flamingos in the sky
They are everywhere
They dont love us unless we give them food
Come here my brethren
But flamingos arent the only exotic animals on this island
Bro  Thats a dinosaur
This is so cool
And believe it or not
this turtle could theoretically live over 200 years
Mr Tortoise my name is Jimmy
If my descendants descendants descendants come here
Tell them I was awesome
And afterwards
we got swarmed by a bunch of lemurs that live on this island over here
Get over here!
Jimmy I dont know if you noticed that theres two lemurs on your head
Yeah I know Im trying not to move
Ill put food on there  Please dont
And if youre wondering where all these exotic animals came from
most of them sadly are endangered species and are all on this island
because the owner
Richard Branson brought all of them here to help prevent them
from going extinct
But the most endangered animal on the island
were the mermaids that serve you sushi
Mermaids and sushi
This is luxury
Do you guys want sushi?  I wouldnt say no
Is that cannibalism?
Its like a family reunion Get over here
Theres honestly so much on this island
We cant even film it all
We play tennis we play basketball
We explore yet another mansion
I did my first cold plunge
You get the idea
Theres so much to do on this island
Its actually overwhelming
This ones actually pretty intense
Im like actually scared
You know what else is intense?  What?
The final island Ill see you there
Why are we still here?
And on the way to the 250 million Island
we stopped in shark infested waters because I have to pay for this video
And now that Im surrounded by sharks
and what feels like my worst nightmare
Im going to tell you guys about Stumble Guys
Bro theyre so close
Oh my gosh
And the worst part is Im not coming out until Im done with this ad
Stumble Guys is a freetoplay mobile player game
where 32 people compete for the crown
You have to be an absolute maniac to do this
Not even Stumble Guys could pay me to do this
Why are you all here sharks?
Theyre so close theyre so close
And for their new season
they went all out with the new MrBeast skins
animations and emotes
Okay square head have it
Bro this is nuts
I want to make sure theres enough sharks for Jimmy
They also added a brand new level
but you have to follow a pattern as long as possible to stay alive
And the longer you live the harder it gets
Is a shark hitting me?
I think the sharks are hitting the cage Its rocking!
Oh this is scary
Not only that
I also just released my new toolkit so you can build your own MrBeast level
This is one of their best seasons ever
You need to try my new MrBeast level plus build your own
And I want to see what you guys come up with
The sharks keep hitting the cage So Im going to get out of here
Make sure to download Stumble Guys for free
so I dont have to go back in the shark cage
Youre alive
Lets go do more things that have nothing to do with sharks
And now that Ive paid off the debt Ive incurred from this video
lets visit the 250 million island
This is a 250 million private island
This extraordinary island has an entire amusement park
with over a dozen waterslides
It also has its own hot air balloon and just about every activity
you could imagine
And we have it all to ourselves
There are no other guests here but out of every feature youve seen
on these islands so far this one stands above the rest
In the middle of the island is a massive waterslide
even though literally eight year olds ride that waterslide
I might still chicken out because Im afraid of heights
But before taking on the water slide
we checked out the other features like how theres over
a hundred jetskis on this island
Its a bit overkill
And not to mention
theres a literal zip lines that span across manmade beaches
Whats the helmet for?
What am I going to hit?
The ground bro
Because sometimes people fall off
This is like really scary  Yeah
Good luck  Thank you
Karl youre kind of far behind
This is awesome
This is actually not that crazy
And if you own this island you can host over 13000
of your friends at any of these five gargantuan pools
Oh this kind of looks like it was made in Minecraft
And its so funny just seeing my two friends in it
Nolan looks like a tiny speck
For 250 million
this island of course has exotic animals
Is that a peacock?
Sir I need to take you in for questioning
And even every game you can imagine
I wish there is the 13000 people that are normally here
to watch how bad he is at Cornhole
Is that soccer pool?
This island has things I didnt even know existed
But something I noticed is there were way too many lifeguards
at this island for just the four of us
How many lifeguards are on this island?
Over 100  Really?
With this many lifeguards you would have to try to drown
So I thought itd be fun if we gave them all the day off
Has anyone ever rented this island before?
No one
This is the first  Dude you are leaning back
You look way too relaxed
And after all 100 lifeguards went down
they decided to hype up the boys and I for our turn on the slide
Here we go!
Oh my Gosh!
Boys you want to know whats even scarier than that?
That one
Why is it so terrifying tonight?
It looks so scary
We can skip it
Towering at over 135 feet tall
This is the tallest water slide in all of North America
I dont even know what Im looking at
Its like a skyscraper
But Im scared
Daredevils Peak What a soothing name
Very inviting
Were so up
Its kind of freaking me out
All right we made it to the top
Are you guys just waiting for us up here?
Listen to how intense the wind is up here
Oh dont look down
Look how crazy the island looks Oh my God
Karl!  No
Nolan! Oh!
Would you say nose goes is enforceable?
Nose goes is enforceable
There we go!
The lifeguards said you got to go Nolan
I love you Mom
Ill see you on the other side
All right go
Oh my God!
Oh I got hit by a truck
Lets do this
You better come down after me
Oh God
Why is it so fast?
Is it actually that scary?
Im going to do this for your entertainment
even though giant rides scare me
Here we go
That is going so fast
And even though I was basically just drowning
the entire time down this waterslide
I gotta say this whole island was pretty awesome
