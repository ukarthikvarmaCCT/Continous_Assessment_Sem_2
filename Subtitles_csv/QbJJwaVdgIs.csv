That helicopter is carrying a military squad
and its gonna land right over there
explosion booms If that squad successfully
hunts me down before the end of the day
they get this hundred grand
Run run run
Get in get in  Go go go
Oh theyre running after us
They are right on our tail
we gotta get outta here
I purposely put their car further away
so I can get a head start
Sean Get in the vehicle lets go!
Come on
intense instrumental music
Right now hes not too far away
Hes right on the other side of these trees it looks like
All right we gotta be quick
Okay were crossing the bridge
Hey Chandler?
Yeah?  You know what to do
I got you engine rumbling
Ive been waiting for this
So Ive done this in the past
where I ran away from a bounty hunter and the FBI
but Ive never ran away from three different people
intense instrumental music
explosion booming
I think Jimmy can get away now
Were like a mile down the road and I heard that
Ooh  Oh
Yeah you might have to go another way
The quickest way out of that field is this bridge
that we just blew up explosion booming
So now they have to take the long way out
and that should give me like a five to 10 minute head start
I rented an entire museum have dozens of cars
giant military equipment and so much other cool stuff
This is just the beginning
Hes heading up back up like northwest
This is where things get fun
As you see the Squid Game mask over there
were in the right place  What?
Who is this guy?
Now we are in a warehouse full of jeeps
Lets just say when they pull up
theyre gonna be very confused
Do you know what to do when they get here?
No  No
Jimmy Just drive in a random direction
Right now?  No when they get here
Oh  And now we patiently wait
and monitor the security cam
Looks like hes stopped at a building
Cameraman 2 Whats the strategy? Wait is that a knife?
Yeah  Is this the spot boys?
Yeah this is the spot intense instrumental music
Weve spotted the military squad on the security cameras
All the doors on this building are locked
Lets see if they break into the warehouse
Im gonna stay out front
just in case somebody decides to run out the front door
Were gonna check out the backside
see if theres a vehicle back here
So one of them is waiting at the front door
and two of them are in the back
Were just gonna patiently wait
The tracker is still in the building
Zach We got some glass doors
we can break up front here
All right sounds good
Im gonna grab this to go break some windows
There are fresh tire tracks leading in as well
Jims going to get the vehicle
Im gonna go ahead and break in
Sean All right go
glass shattering
Voice On Radio Military has breached the building
Its time to go
I should probably recline so its harder to see me
Im gonna hide under this blanket
so they cant see me in this car
Lock your doors  Go go go now!
Zach lets roll back to the Hummer
intense instrumental music
engine noise drown out speaker
Jim Which one? Which one?
Cameraman That should be them right there
Jimmy Do they notice me?
Cameraman We drove right past each other
intense instrumental music
We made it out with all the other teams
Oh my gosh!
Dude they didnt even know how to react
Hes on the move again
Hes straight ahead due south
This is the tracker that is telling the military squad
where I am at all times
And if I put the tracker inside of this special bag
it jams it
And now they dont know where I am
It looks like the vehicle may have stopped
I dont see Jimmy
I think hes messing with us
All right so hold on It just updated
Hes straight north again
Sean cheering
upbeat instrumental music
And now were in the middle of nowhere
Theres literally nothing out here
except this old barn that I had constructed
Whoa  Mind if I set
my hundred grand right here?
Bad news
Theres only two seats inside of here
Jimmy groans
I think I see them duck quacks
Coming up on the tracker
Holy cow here they come!
Check the car and take the top
