Hello friends!
Every year on 1st February
the countrys budget is announced  by the countrys finance minister
In which we get to know
how much money does the government earn
how much is spent in different places
for the welfare of the people
As usual this year too on 1st February
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman
presented the Union Budget 2024
But the difference was that this years budget
was an Interim Budget
I commend the Interim Budget
to this August House
Jai Hind!
It is a temporary budget
that will only give estimates for the entire year
This is because this year
the Lok Sabha elections will take place
After the elections once the  new government is formed
the full budget will be presented in July
This is done every time it is an election year
but this does not mean that
the interim budget is not crucial
This tells us how the government  will spend money during the next few months
And we will also get to know the overall  strategy and direction of the government
So come lets understand in this video
whats in this new budget for you
the common people
and the promises made in the previous budgets
as well as the expenses
how much of it was achieved
and what were their results
Similar to the last year
the main focus area of the government in the budget
was Capital Expenditure
In short it is also called CAPEX
It refers to the money that the  government spends on longterm assets
Large infrastructure projects in the economy
like making roads railways ports
largescale buildings or bridges
Last year the government had already  increased this expenditure a lot by 33
and allocated 10 trillion
The data shows that
although the government had not  spent the entire 10 trillion last year
the actual spending was still 95 trillion
But this year it has been increased further by 111
the government plans to spend 1111 trillion this year
The reason behind this is very simple
The government says that if money is spent on these avenues
then it boosts economic growth
and lead to employment creation
People get jobs when such big bridges  roads and ports are built
The Finance Minister said that in the last 4 years
the capital expenditure has increased by 3 times
For railways specifically
255 trillion have been allocated
and 3 new corridors have been announced
Energy Mineral and Cement Corridor
Port Connectivity Corridor
and High Traffic Density Corridor
The Finance Minister has also said that
more than 40000 normal rail coaches
will be converted to Vande Bharat standards
Forty thousand normal rail bogies
will be converted to the Vande Bharat standards
This years railways allocation
is much higher than last years 241 trillion
While last year we had already seen an increase of 1 trillion
This is good news
but hopefully its impact
will be seen on the ground in railway safety as well
Because last year there were many accidents
On 29th October the train collision in Andhra Pradesh
On 11th October Bihar North East Express derailment
On 26th September Mathura EMU train derailment
And in June 2023 we witnessed the train collision in Odisha
which was one of the most dangerous  accidents in the history of the nation
Almost 300 people lost their lives in this accident
In India where at least 260 people have been k!lled
in a train crash in the eastern state of Odisha
Its already the countrys worst train crash this century
In the agriculture sector
the goverment has announced
Atmanirbhar Oil Seeds Abhiyan
and focused on fertilisers like NanoDAP
NanoDAP stands for
Nano DiAmmonium Phosphate
A type of ecofriendly fertiliser
with 8 nitrogen and 16 phosphorous
This is very useful for Green Farming
Thats why it is being promoted
On the other hand in the Oil Seeds Initiative
the government has said that
they want to cut the imports from outside the country
They want to cut down edible oil  imports from 60 to 30
So that India can become selfreliant in  seeds like mustard groundnut soybean sunflower
But the subsidies that are given for fertilizers
saw a budget cut
In comparison to the 189 trillion from last year
only 164 trillion has been allocated this year
Food subsidies have also been cut
Last years budget allocation was 212 trillion
This year it has been reduced to 205 trillion
In the education and healthcare sectors
we got some bad news
The government had already cut  the education budget last year
But the amount that the government  had promised to spend last year
they didnt even spent that their spending was lower than that
In last years budget the government  promised to spend 116 trillion on education
But according to the revised budget estimates
the government will be able to spend only 108 trillion
This year there is a small increase in the education budget
Instead of 116 trillion
the government has now allocated 125 trillion
On top of that in the education sector
big budget cuts have been made in many places
For example the budget allocated to UGC  the University Grants Commission
has been cut by 60
Last years revised estimate was 6409 billion
This year they were given only 25 billion
The budget allocated to IITs and IIMs  has also been decreased this year
Instead of 10384 billion
10324 billion for IITs
Instead of 3 billion for IIMs last year
only 212 billion have been allocated this year
But where has this budget increased in education?
More money is being spent on central universities
Instead of the 115 billion last year
150 billion have been allocated this year
The amount spent on research  and innovation has been increased
Instead of 2 billion last year
this year 355 billion has been allocated
In the healthcare sector last year the government
had allocated 890 billion
But according to revised estimates
only 790 billion will be spent
This year a small increase has been seen
Instead of 890 billion
the government has allocated 900 billion
Here two initiatives have been  announced by the government
First the Ayushman Bharat scheme will be expanded
and second they have focused  on the cervical cancer vaccine too
After this we come to housing
where the Prime Minister Awas scheme is underway
To give affordable housing to the poor
Its allocation has been increased
Instead of the 79590 billion last year
80671 billion have been allocated this year
Under this scheme the government has also said that
they will launch a new scheme for  the deserving sections of the middle class
Those who live in rented houses
slums or unauthorized colonies
will be given the opportunity to  build and buy their own houses
If we talk about the overall economy
Indias real GDP growth rate
which is projected for 20232024
will be at 73
There are two types of GDPs friends
One is the Nominal GDP  and the other is the Real GDP
Nominal GDP shows the size of the  economy according to todays prices
But in real GDP we take inflation into account
For example if the nominal GDP  growth rate of a country is 15
but the inflation rate in the country is 10
then the real GDP growth rate will be
15  10  5
But in 202223 Indias actual Nominal GDP growth rate
is 105
And our inflation is approximately 4 per cent
So the real GDP growth rate is 65
This is a bit low because
in December 2023 RBI had raised its projections
and said that Indias GDP growth rate would be around 7
But today this is near 65
If we look at the estimates of international  agencies for Indias GDP growth rate
they are in the similar range
In October 2023 the IMF projected  Indias growth rate to be 63
And for 202425 World Bank has projected 64
OECD has projected 61
and ADB has projected 67
IMF has also projected that India
will become the thirdlargest economy by 2027
It is very interesting to see
how different agencies identify patterns in data
and predict the growth of a country
Data scientists are often tasked with this work
And this is the reason why today data science
is one of the most lucrative career options
Data and the conclusions from data
have a huge impact on different industries
The figures for GDP growth rate are so important that
it can cause the market to go up or crash

Now lets get back to the video
Next we come to the second  biggest focus area of this budget
that is reducing the fiscal deficit
The Fiscal Deficit is the difference between  the governments revenue and expenditure
The amount spent by the government
and the revenue it earns
the difference between the two
And since the word Deficit is being used here
it means that compared to the revenue of the government
they are spending more than that
For this year Indias Fiscal Deficit is estimated to be
1786 trillion
But we usually look at the Fiscal Deficit  as a percentage of GDP
Last year the government had set a target that
it should be 59 of GDP this year
And revised estimates show that
not only has the government achieved its target
but they have brought it down to 58
In this years budget the Fiscal Deficit target  for 20242025 is set at 51 of GDP
This is lower than before which is a good thing
In fact in 2003 the government had passed an Act
the Fiscal Responsibility  and Budget Management Act 2003
According to this Act
the governments target should be
to keep the fiscal deficit at only 3 of nominal GDP
But since then there has been only one year
around 200708
where the government was able to meet this target
Since the last few years the government
is slowly reducing it so that
it can be brought down to that range
And for the Financial Year 2026
the target is set at 45
Whatever money the government earns
onethird of it
is spent on interest servicing
Interest Servicing refers to the interest payments  of the loan taken by the government
Both domestic and international  borrowings are included in this
Whether the government has borrowed  money from within the country
or from outside the country
In total this year the government will
spend 119 trillion on Interest Servicing
This number has increased by 135 trillion  in comparison to last year
In this table you can see the major expenses
of the government based on this years budget
And it has been compared to
the revised budget estimates of last year
If we talk about taxes
there is nothing for the common people in this budget
because nothing has changed  in comparison to last year
The income tax slabs are still there
But another interesting thing to see here is that
which taxes generate the most revenue for the government?
Budget documents show that in FY 2025
the government will earn 19 of its revenue
from taxes collected under the Income Tax
On the second number is GST with 18
The government will earn 18 of its  revenue from the taxes collected under GST
And then comes the Corporate Tax at 17
This shows that the biggest  contribution to the governments revenue
is that of the Income Tax payers
And the GST payers
And the contribution of the Corporate  Tax paid by the companies
is lower than these
However the bigger source of income for the government
is still borrowing
Borrowing money is at 28
The Finance Minister has put a tagline for this budget
Viksit Bharat by 2047 Developed India by 2047
And she has also promised that
India will become a developed nation by 2047
And also that by 2030
India will become a 7 trillion dollar economy
As per the latest report by the Finance Ministry
the Indian economy can of course
hit the and can aspire to hit the 7 trillion mark by 2030
It sounds good to hear
but the reality is revealed only when
you compare these promises
with the promises made in the previous years
In the 2019 Niti Aayog meeting PM Modi said that
he will make India a 5 trillion economy by 2024
2024 is here
forget about the 5 trillion economy
India is not even a 4 trillion economy yet
The current status of India is a 37 trillion economy
Had the government wanted
they could have come up with a new  deadline for the 5 trillion economy promise
Even though it didnt happen by 2024
they could have made 2026 or 2027 the new deadline
but then people would have remembered that
they had already talked about  the 5 trillion economy previously
Instead the government decided that
this number should be pushed one step further
and now they are promising  a 7 trillion economy by 2030
By the way I would also like to remind you that
around 201718
they were talking about a New India by 2022
In 2022 Indias 75 years of independence was completed
So the government made it a deadline
And PM Modi had promised that
every person every citizen
will have a home to live peacefully by 2022
It was also said that by 2022
farmers income will be doubled
and there will be bullet trains in India
This deadline has been pending for 2 years
Mark my works when India will actually  become a 5 trillion economy
which will definitely happen someday no doubt about it
because theres GDP growth
Then youll see how it will be  presented as a new achievement
The Finance Minister focused on  4 main sections of society in the budget
Poor people women youth  and the ones who feed us the farmers
She said that their welfare
is the governments highest priority
Only when they progress
will the country progress
Its absolutely correct
But the reality is that
Indias ranking in the Hunger Index is falling
Today Indias ranking is 111 out of 125 on the Hunger Index
which reveals the widespread hunger in the country
Youth Unemployment is at 45
for the ages of 2024
Womens labour participation in Indias workforce
has been falling for the past few years
In 2005 it used to be 32
In 2021 it was only 19
And here the middle class is facing  more and more difficulties
Look at this chart
This chart shows that between 2016 and 2021
the increase and decrease in household  income across various sections in India
The richest 20 of the population of the country
their income has increased by a good 40
And the upper middle class got some benefits too
But the actual middle class lower middle  class and the poor people of the country
have seen only losses in the last few years
Their income has decreased
And the worst impact of it
has been on the poorest 20 of the people
This data was published by  Indias Consumer Economy 360 survey
The unfortunate thing is that
it is becoming increasingly difficult to access  such data in the country with each day
Because the government simply does not  disclose the uncomfortable data to the public
At the bottom of this chart it is written that
Official public data on
Indian income and consumption inequality
has become very hard or impossible
to be obtained in recent years
Look at this article from 27th March
the Union government has no data
on Indias offshore shell companies
Neither does the government have data on
how many farmers were k!lled in the farmers protests
Nor does it have data on how many  migrants faced difficulties during COVID
Nor does it have data on how many  people were k!lled in mob lynching
nor the data on how many MSMEs  had to be shut down during lockdown
This is why opposition leaders  have often mocked the government
saying that NDA means No Data Available
And the things for which  theres some kind of data available
its impossible to know
which data to trust
While announcing this budget the Finance Minister said that
in the last 10 years the government has
assisted 250 million people to get  freedom from multidimensional poverty
In these 10 years
the Government has assisted
25 crore people  250 million people
to get freedom from multidimensional poverty
But last year in December Amit Shah had said that
the Modi government had
help 600 million people to be free from poverty
So is the 250 million number correct?
Or the 600 million?
No idea
Anyways coming back to the budget
this was the story of this years Interim Budget
We will get to know the rest of the details
when the full budget is presented in July
