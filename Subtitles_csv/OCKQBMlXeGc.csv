This school in Cameroon has
extremely dilapidated and hazardous classrooms
No running water or electricity
and only a single toilet shared by over 3000 kids
and staff daily
And whats even worse is despite the schools
mission to empower young girls
and provide them a safe haven from domestic abuse
and other challenging conditions
many children cannot enroll
because of overcrowding and deteriorating conditions
So in this video were going
to rebuild the school from this to this
this to this
and this to this
to give these kids a better opportunity at life
We started out by sending Dan and Darren
there a few months ago to see how we could help
Upon their arrival they met with Francis
an extraordinary man who has dedicated his life
to combat inequality and suffering in Cameroon
He is the founder of CDVTA
an organization that helps build wells
facilities and solar power installations and aids
The development of education throughout Cameroon
When we first visited the school
What we saw of those children
were actually on the conditions
of lack of sanitation
Some of them were abused
They had no right to raise their voice
They could not speak for themselves
These conditions had no dignity
These conditions would not make your child believe that
the future is bright
The kids that are in the
school are sitting in classrooms
that are literally made out of scrap wood
Ive been shooting
in one of these classrooms for 5 minutes
and my face is literally dripping with sweat
I cant imagine what it must
be like to sit in here for an hour long lesson and learn
The environment is first of all dirty
That is dust all over
We dont have ceiling boards
The state of these classrooms is tragic for many reasons
but mainly because this school is on the border
of the English and French parts of Cameroon
making it a rare junction point
between two populations in ongoing conflict
This school could help unite these communities
Many people have moved from the English part
and is settled in this area
This school became a safe place for them to come and
get educated here
But because of the poorly built
infrastructure rain leaks through the roof in winter
There is no electricity and the school was beyond
maximum capacity
Once we saw this we knew we had to do something
So almost immediately  The team quickly
got to work to completely
transform the school and surprise the kids
before they got back from their school break
And before the kids returned from their holidays
Darren and Dan went to visit their brand new classrooms
Darren and I looked
at the new structures which have airflow
They have lights of electricity
Let there be light!
I cant wait to see the look on the kids faces
The teachers faces when they get to see
the new classrooms also the new bathrooms
The school
is going to transform thousands
and thousands of lives in the future
The next day it was finally time
to surprise the kids
Theres a whole bunch of people outside the school
This is really exciting
The school was the busiest it had ever been with kids
beyond excited to get a glimpse
of the brand new classrooms
I just got out of the car
Theres a whole bunch of people
over here to welcome me
This is a little bit crazy
The headmaster Dillon
turned to the new classrooms
where he would officially cut the ribbon
and declare the new school open
When the environment is beautiful
academics moves positively just the happiness
motivates them psychologically to study and study well
When interacting with these kids over here
I realized that these are children
that have a thirst to learn
And providing them the opportunity to realize
that is probably the best legacy
that well leave behind in this community
I cant imagine the impact this will have on the lives
of children in this school Thank you
Thank you
And thank you very much indeed
Before I show you an unexpected surprise
the community had for Darren
I want to tell you about the amazing sponsor

millions of clothes worldwide

hundreds of electric bikes all across the globe
And now for the eighth time this year they stepped up
and helped us build this school in Cameroon
So I just want to give a heartfelt
thank you to Lectric EBikes
for their continuous support
Lets get back to the video
Now it is time for Darrens surprise
So the village leaders took him to a ceremonial hut
and dressed him up in local attire
He then took part in a traditional Cameroonian
induction as a village elder
Hold it now
Hold it  Yeah!
Ive just been honored as a chief in the village
Now that Darren had finally become a chief
it was time to say goodbye to Cameroon and these kids
