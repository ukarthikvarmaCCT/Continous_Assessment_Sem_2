Im going to spend the next
seven days buried alive under 20000 pounds of dirt
This is the scariest thing I have ever done
All right well I guess its time bury me alive
That was scary
This is going to be terrifying
This is pretty much most peoples worst fear
Oh my God That dirt is terrifying
Brace yourself Ha ha ha
Drop the payload
Oh God
I feel like I need to hold the roof
My roof is shaking
Im entrusting my life to this coffin for the next seven days
Lets pray it doesnt just randomly decide to break
And obviously this goes without saying
But yes this is 100 real
And Ill be honest
I severely underestimated how hard this was going to be
And with that the challenge has officially started
I am now trapped in here for the next seven days
It took the boys so long to bury me alive that I already have to pee
And the challenge just started
In case youre wondering how I use the bathroom down here
Well yeah
This is so uncomfortable
All I have to survive the next seven days
My foot!
is the food in this briefcase
which is basically just some MREs and snacks
My foot went numb
Five gallon drum of water over there
And whatever essentials the boys put in this briefcase
which probably means Im going to run out of food way
before the seven day mark
In all seriousness
This is extremely dangerous
And so I dont suffocate
I need to make sure people are watching me at all times
Jimmy can you hear this?
Yeah it sounds like Nolans mom is jumping on the surface
If we had 12 people maybe it would be that
Its almost 1 am
I have a feeling a lot of you are going to start going to bed
I need someone to be near a walkie at all times
So if I need something I actually need one of you to answer okay?
And now that I have nothing better to do
Im going to head to bed and Im either going to wake up
well rested or crushed by 20000 pounds of dirt
Hopefully I wake up wellrested
Sleep is going to be key to finishing this challenge
because when Im asleep
Im not thinking about the fact that Im trapped in this box
But that only works most of the time
Is there a fly in here?
The goal is to sleep as much through this challenge as possible
For my own sanity
Oh look at him
He looks so cozy
Jimmy Jam!
Nolan drew all over your face
Nolan how many hours till your mom comes to set?
No I know youre going to say something
Hopefully she doesnt actually crush the coffin
Show him
My strategy during this video was to sleep the entire time
I completely forgot though
My friends are going to annoy me and not let me sleep
This is going to be miserable
I want to start today off by turning these long pants into shorts
I just punched that box
Mission one complete Your boy has shorts
This is our food briefcase
Lets give this MRE a try
MRE stands for Meal Ready to Eat
All you have to do is add hot water and it chemically cooks the food
The boys on the other hand were grilling up
steaks and literally feasting on top of my grave
You know Jimmy just for you
were going to eat MREs for the rest of the time were out here
Really?  Yeah
I literally heard Tareq in the background saying no
Enjoy your hot water pasta in a bag
Meanwhile this is my reality
Oh its crunchy
Why is pasta crunchy?
This is This is great
I was so bored I actually ended up punching my coffin for fun
until my knuckles started to hurt
So I put a sock on my hand so I could keep punching the wall
Im desperate for entertainment
Oh Jimmy
Thank God Im so bored
One second
What did you do?
Yo that actually scared me
Can you at least semi explain to me what youre doing?
Seeing how my life is on the line?
All right
Unfortunately the boys are incapable of explaining anything
What theyve done is theyve stuck a pipe
all the way down to my grave vacuumed the dirt out of it
just to take this surgical wire camera
and feed it down and look at me suffer
Yeah thats what happens
Thats what happens
Its time to go in
This is so surgical
What is that?
Oh that fly on my leg freaked me out
Get away from me
You want to hold this steady?
Just keep looking
Move your  We see him
Having fun?
Good night Jimmy
And when day two was coming to a close
the boys left me to go spend time by their RV
And being the under stimulated man I was
I thought itd be a good time to crack into their essentials briefcase
and see what was inside
Wait hes opening the card
Is this Nolans mom?
I found a photo of your mom
Did you do that?  No that was not me
Nolan is this your mom?
Oh my God Shes on his chest
Oh my God
Besides somehow losing this picture if I had to
guess what I think would make me quit this challenge
it would be not wanting to poop underground
Back pain back pain back pain
And maybe some back pain
And obviously you can tell
this is already getting pretty hard for me
But like usual you better bet its going to get a whole lot worse
Its raining really heavy right now
I just woke up to the sound of thunder Nolan wake up
We got to check on Jimmy make sure hes like not crushed
Im actually kind of concerned
This looks way more funeralesque
You think that dirts heavier now?
Dirt plus rain is heavy
I think I have an idea of how to wake him up
Is someone drilling?
Its one of those days
I dont even have my pants on yet
And things are already getting crazy
Jimmy can you hear us?
What are you doing up there?
There are currently 15 speakers on top of your grave
So if I had to guess Kris is about to play stupid music
Jimmy its a party up here
Oh my
Yo my coffins actually shaking
Jimmy theres an earthquake oh my God
Wait what is that?
I just noticed theres an unscrewed bolt
on the side of my coffin
His screws came loose in the coffin
From the base?
Are you kidding?  Literally from the base
Should I be concerned this wasnt screwed all the way in
Max it out
What the heck are you doing right now?
Im vibrating
These vibrations are kind of hurting my head
Why is there flowers in my hair? Im freaking out
Okay lets go dig a tunnel
Were going to start the tunnel right here
and dig all the way into Jimmys coffin
We have the speakers blaring noise so that he doesnt hear us digging
Ive got an idea
Well play construction noises over the speakers
So that way he doesnt hear the excavator
Theres a loud noise and no ones answering over the walkie
So either Im about to die
Its like playing a video game
Or theyre about to do something dumb
Except for you could accidentally kill somebody
Ive officially crossed the 50 hour mark
I have now been buried longer than I was last time I did this challenge
I promised my doctor
that I would move every day so I dont get blood clots
cause apparently lay down for seven days straight can kill you
Im digging a hole
We got to loosen up the dirt for Kris
I asked the boys to pack dumbbells and they gave me 3 pound dumbbells
I smell so bad
Yeah Im going to do my best not to think about the fact
that I could die
when I stand up and a couple of days
Kris go a few feet deeper
Im not certified to do this at all
I am bored in a coffin
We definitely stayed up all night
and dug this tunnel and didnt pay that guy to do it
Is this safe?
Im going second  Whats that?
And then you bring up the rear Tareq
What is that?
You guys come right behind me
One of the weird parts about this challenge
is theres so many cameras always reporting at all times
We should dig a couple more inches and then were to the coffin
It didnt really bother me the first few days
but I just have this weird feeling
someones always staring at me and its starting to like kind of
irritate me
Oh there he is there he is
We almost got him  What is that sound I hear?
Hi Jimmy
Hi Jimmy!  Jimmy!
Hey Jimmy do you see us?
I see Nolans forehead
Yeah its hard to miss
How long did it take to dig that tunnel?
Literally all night Jimmy
This is not what I was expecting to happen today
Hey Nolan one second What do you think of that photo?
What do I have to do to get rid of that picture of my mom?
This is the only thing keeping me sane
How do I get it back?  Im framing this and keeping it forever
Im sorry
Youve been in this coffin for so long
that you forgot about what happened to the channel
Yeah!  Yeah!
Were almost at 200 million
Youre going to hit 200 million subscribers in that coffin
Wish I could see it live
Me too my friend
Nolan has a surprise for you as well
Were going to tape this Feastables bar to Jimmy
Oh my God its hot down here
Is that the new Feastables bar?
Hey this is actually pretty good marketing by my friends
now in every timelapse Feastables will be there
I hope tomorrows easier
Its a weird feeling I am very tired but for some reason I cant sleep
I dont know Ive never had this happen before
Why am I crying?
I dont know
Its officially day five
Only two more days in this nightmare
I dont think humans are meant to lay down for five days straight
Ill try to act like Im not depressed
Almost there!
Jimmy we got paintball guns and were going to shoot your tombstone
That sounds fun Can I join?
I dont even know what to say to them
Jimmy what have you been doing for fun?
Nothing Im in mental agony
Have you pooped yet?
I have to poop really badly but Im going to see
if I can hold it in for the next two days
I dont know why but I have like no motivation to do anything
Ive been laying here for five days and I dont even have enough energy
to prepare a meal
because going to the bathroom down here is so difficult
Dont ask me how but I accidentally got some pee on my shorts
Im cutting off the part of my shorts that are infected
Sorry for how short they are now
That was disgusting
Jimmy were here to celebrate
Were almost at 200 million subs
Well whats the estimate of when we hit it? How long?
Im not a rocket scientist
What does he want from us?
Ive been feeling pretty terrible all day
for the fact that were about to hit 200 million subscribers
Actually makes me kind of happy
You know since were about to hit 200 million subscribers
this would be a super convenient time to talk
about Verizon home Internet
Thats a good point
Verizon 5G home Internet is exactly what it sounds like
Its wireless Internet for your home that runs off
Verizons extremely fast 5G ultra wideband network
And dont ask me how but the gang hacked it
to make sure it worked while Im underground
Were turning it on now
Okay Im connected
And now youre going to watch us hit 200 million
And just by plugging in this little box
thanks to Verizon I now have reliable
5G home Internet
And because of our hack
It actually works Even though Im ten feet underground
I can see my real time subscriber count
Karl did you know that if the people watching this video are over 18
while supplies last when they order Verizon home internet
Verizon will give you an Xbox series S on them
They must hate money
I mean honestly Yeah
And you can get it for as low as 35 a month
So if you want a fast  and reliable internet
just go to mrbeastverizoncom and put in your address
and itll tell you if its available in your area
And now lets focus on the 200 million subscriber goal
We are so close
Before this I was just some random dude in Nebraska and
Now hes just some random dude to North Carolina
I used to be just a random guy in Nebraska
Karl this is a heartfelt moment Dont copy Nolan
Its crazy that we used to like talk about this
sitting at a lunch table and now were at 200 million subscribers
Thats insane
I just want to say its been an honor working with everyone
Lets crush some more goals
And finally Chandler close this off
I first started working here it was like seven of us
and I was the janitor
and now were at 200 million subs and Im very grateful
I started making videos when I was 11
Im 25 now and I never in a million years
thought the channel would get this big
I mean as were about to hit 200 million subscribers
I just want all of you to know that I appreciate
every single one of you to watch my videos
I still remember the days when I would make videos
and literally get zero views Thank you so much
Were going to see all these numbers move
Oh my God!  We did it
Lets go!  Yeah!
We did it!
Oh I think its unfortunately time that we unplug you know
Wait hold on
I havent even got a chance to call my girlfriend yet
Yeah we got you We got you for sure
All right bro were going to be right here
Okay? You just finish that call
Oh come on plug it back in
I just want to say like just 2 minutes
So my girlfriend knows Im alive
Lets go eat  All right
I dont know
Im doing this thing where Im crying
and Im not 100 sure why Im crying
Hitting 200 million with the boys was fun
but now Im just alone and trapped in here again
Its been five days
Five days alone in this coffin
I honestly have no idea how Im going to survive
two more days of this
Im going downhill quickly
Yo Jimmy how you doing?
Oh no response
I dont know if hes alive
Nolan I appreciate you checking in on me and caring but
Are you actually hanging in there?
I know
Jimmy went from being terrified
to an absolute yapster and now hes a sad boy
Im doing my best to talk to you guys for content but
to be honest I have like zero desire to speak
I just want to get out of here
Yeah hes losing his mind
I think we need to find a way to cheer him up
So Im going to make some phone calls
I dont know if Ive told you guys this
but Ive already used up all my pee
bottles and so basically whenever I have to pee
I eat one of these meals and then I just pee in this bag
and zip it up
I know that might be too much information
This challenge is disgusting and I want to leave
I was so down bad that there was only one thing
in this world that could possibly cheer me up
Jimmy I brought somebody
Whod you bring?
My parents
Hows it going?
Well have you talked about Nolans mom at all since youve been down there?
No not whatsoever
And the picture?
I dont know what youre talking about
More importantly do you guys have something super embarrassing
you could tell us about Nolan?
Jimmy theres so many
That will instantly make this challenge so much better
He told us he was going to prom but he actually just
went to the neighbors next door for a little bit
We like to see him bring a girl home for Christmas
Thats all I needed to cheer me up
because I know the comment section is going to go crazy
I hate Jimmy
My mom has one more question
Hit me
All right now you walk away Thats how it works
Did he throw the walkie again?
I know all of you like to sleep in and you dont like getting up early
I dont care
In exactly 12 hours I need you all to start digging
Thats kind of early right?
What time is it?
As long as we wake up for our alarms well be good
What would you do if when I stand up
I get blood clots and just die on the spot?
Id know where to put you
See you in 12 hours
Its a date
Im about to go to bed
and hopefully when I open
these eyes in the morning someone is digging me out of this coffin
So I dont know why Im tearing up
I dont think Ive ever been more excited for anything
in my entire life
I cant wait to see the sunlight tomorrow
Ill see you guys in the morning
This is going to be awesome
Laying down for my final night
All I can think about is whether or not
Id be able to stand when this is over
Its not normal to be laying down and not moving this long
It is officially been seven days
I know you guys dont like doing manual labor but can you dig me up?
Were getting you out Jimmy
This is the worst part of the challenge
Because Im just waiting for my stupid friends to dig me up
And of course theres the added tension
of whether or not Im going to die when I stand up
So yeah
Bring in the excavator
I bet you when I get out the first thing theyre going to say is how bad I smell
this Santa Claus looking guy is going to bring you out now
Karl I dont care what he looks like
Just get me out of this coffin
Dig dig dig dig
Any second now this dirt above me will turn into sunlight
I cant wait
Oh thats the excavator
Oh thats scary
I can see sunlight
Jimmy!  Jimmy!
Hows it going?
Its hard to describe what the sun looks like after
not seeing it for seven days straight
Oh my gosh
I started crying once again
Im not sure why I just couldnt help it
We did it
We did it
The only question that remains
now is when I stand up am I going to die of blood clots?
Well find out in just a minute
Jimmy you ready?
Dont drop it on me
I bet it stinks in there
You guys are predictable
I said thats what you would say
Well lets not celebrate
until I stand up and dont die of blood clots
At least sit up for a second
But wait wait wait wait wait wait
Wait for a medic to come down
Do you feel nauseous at all? dizzy?
Oh I dont know
Thats good enough for me come on up Jimmy
This is my first time standing in a week
Oh my God My legs are weak
Oh I didnt die  Yeah! Time to go
All good!
I do feel like a rush of blood to my head though
Its is actually a crazy feeling but the real surprise
was waiting for me just above ground
Oh wow theres so many people
After seven days
I was finally able to celebrate 200 million subscribers the right way
We have to celebrate 200 million bro
Now that you all saw my underwear Im going to end the video
And as always lets end with an explosion
