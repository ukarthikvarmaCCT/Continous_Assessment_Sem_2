Hello my name is Anpu and welcome to my YouTube channel and today
I wanted to you know introduce the Indian accent to you and I am very well aware that there is a
big variety of
Indian accents and not just Indian there is a Sri Lankan Pakistani and you know all over a South asia
there is different accent but I want to to introduce to you the South Indian accent You know
I am very interested in accents
And I you know if you ever interested in learning the Indian accent and perhaps you have a you know at acting role
Where you have to learn Indian accent this video will cover the basics of the Indian accent
So without further ado lets get straight into this video
Lets just address the elephant in the room
You were clearly judging me on my Indian accent werent you?
You know Im also passionate about like you know identity and racism but that is not the topic of todays discussion
Todays discussion is about the Indian accent and if you follow as few simple steps and a few simple rules
Youll be able to master the Indian accent You know really easily
Lets start off with the t sound so the t sounds something like this
tur not t tur  so your tongue is actually further back in your mouth
so for example if you want to say the word but in the Indian accent its but
Butokay so not but but so lets try
Its not dot its not
Okay so Im really exaggerating the t here
so try and practice that sound yeah and
Then tone it down a little bit so dot yeah it
It it
It so in the sentence dont try it becomes dont try it
Try it
so once youve practiced that the next sound practice is the L sound so
Lets take the word table for example
When we say the word table we dont actually pronounce the L in table
Youve got the t sound which we talked about earlier and this L sound so practice to start not teh
t and
Then it becomes
not table table
So can you put the you know groceries on the table?
please the next sound is the w sound so British people will pronounce w as work and
so the word water
turns into vodka
Okay so the w turns into a V and
Then the t in water is the sound that we practiced earlier
Then the R is what the last sound is what were going to practice So art isnt rough Its rough
so var Dad
Var det another one could be pizza beep done
Peter I
spoke to be Dead on the Phone I
Spoke to Peter on the phone
Alright so Im sure you can hear that difference there
and Ive tried to break down the particular sounds that sound different so go away and practice that and
You know I might do a part two
So hit like on this video if you found that video useful and you know this this video is not intended to make fun out
