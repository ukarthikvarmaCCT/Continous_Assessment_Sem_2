Welcome to Techno Ruhez this  is the first video of our in MWC
There is a lot of noise  I apologize for that
But here we have come to the Infinix booth and we have got to witness two big technologies
The first thing is that  I have this phone
This is Infinixs eColorShift  technology smartphone
It has Prism 3 technology
If you look at the back  it glows in different colors
And it reacts according  to the design you want
That is if you want to wave someone or want some other design you can do that here
You get 8 basic colors in this and you can  customize this color in 100 different ways
You get to see a lot of amazing  technologies in this
And in the future such phones  of Infinix will come to the market
in which we will get  ColorShift technology
Its back panel is quite  premium than normal phones
As I was telling you if  you look at this back panel
you will feel that this  is a front display
But this is not a front display  this is a back panel
And if you look here  it glows like this
It will look like there is a camera in the  display but it is not like that
This is a back design
So this kind of technology will  be in the future smartphones
where the whole back  panel will glow in different colors
which you can customize  according to your needs
Do tell us in the comments  how did you like this technology
And this is our  AirCharge technology
You will see that this phone  is getting charged here
And this is a device of Infinix
And in this device you just have  to take your phone close to it
You dont have to  connect it with a wire
You dont have to  touch it wirelessly
Its not like you put it  in a wireless charger
As soon as I take it here you will see  that the phone has started charging
You can see that the  phone is charging
I havent done anything and  the phone is charging here
This is AirCharge technology
Right now Max you can  see the charging speed of 75W
Its 20cm
It wont work from here
I will have to take it very close
And when I go you will see  that the charging has started
The distance you get  here is not much
Its very less
If you come up to 10cm then  it provides you with a charging speed of 15W
So this is their  AirCharge technology
Infinix has done it here
Which other brand  I think Oppo has done it before
Now Infinix has done it here
I would like to test it again
This is the phone
As soon as we take it here you  will see that the charging has started
This is how AirCharge  technology works here
We will get to see this in  the market very soon
And who knows we might get 30W 50W  60W fast charging through AirCharge in the future
And before I go I will give  you an exclusive news
It is being said that Infinix will launch a  flagship smartphone very soon
Many people complain that Infinix  does not launch flagship smartphones
Why dont they do it?
So we have come to their booth
And they have shared  this video with us
It is being said that a very powerful  chipset is going to be installed
And this chipset is not any else  but Mediatek Dimensity 9300
We have also spoken  to Mediatek people here
And they have also confirmed that this  chipset is going to be installed in Infinix phones
And they are going to give it to you
So it is very good news that Infinix will  launch a flagship smartphone
In which Mediatek  Dimensity 9300 is going to be installed
So lets hope for the best
I hope you will like todays video
I have shown you three technologies
EColorshift technology AirCharge  technology and a flagship smartphone from Infinix
