Hello friends!
World War II is the most devastating war in human history
Numerous large cities were left crumbling after this war
Today nearly all geopolitical events
and international relations can be traced back
to this War
Friends Ive told you many stories from WWII
in previous videos
But in this video come lets understand WWII in depth
Starting to end
What happened exactly?
And what was its impact?
This is the story of World War II
It is difficult to track down
one single event
that sparked the conflict
For ultimately it was a series of events
that conspired together
To eventually light a flame of war
The worlds most hated treaty
the Treaty of Versailles
thus starting World War II in 1939
The whole world is
against Hitler and Hitlerism
Lets begin this story in 1919
The year when World War I ended
And the famous peace treaty was signed
known as the Treaty of Versailles
This treaty contained an important clause
Article 231
Which held that
all the losses caused due to World War I
Germany was to bear the responsibility for all such losses
This clause is also known as War Guilt Clause
because basically it was trying to imply
that regardless of the countries participating in the war
Germany was to be blamed for it entirely
France and Britain wanted
Germany to pay heavy costs for losing this war
They wanted to recover their losses from Germany
As a result according to the Treaty of Versailles
Germany was told to pay a fine of 33 Billion to the other countries
In todays money it amounts to around 270 Billion
This is such a large amount that you wont believe that
it was only in 2010
Germany made the final payment of this fine
It took almost 100 years
Youd wonder where this money comes from
Obviously from Germany
From its citizens
The first payment of this fine was made by Germany in 1921
right after that there was hyperinflation in Germany
Germanys currency back then was the German Mark
you cant imagine how rapidly it was devalued
In 1922 in Berlin a packet of bread cost 160 Marks
The following year in 1923
the same packet of bread cost 200 Billion Marks
Obviously the economy was crippled
And the rate of unemployment rose rapidly
In such circumstances in our story entered
Adolf Hitler
A young political leader
who knew how to manipulate the masses with his speeches
In 1923 Hitlers Nazi Party
tried to overthrow the German government
By staging a coup
Even though this attempt failed
this caused Hitlers popularity among the masses to increase manifold
Rumours were spread among the people
that the embarrassment faced by Germany
the international humiliation of Germany
were because of the antinational elements living in the country
People were distressed
It was easy to manipulate them
Hitler claimed that the Jews and Socialists living in the country
were to be blamed
They were the reason for Germanys disgrace
Over the next 10 years propaganda was used in abundance
media organisations were paid hate speeches were everywhere
I wont go into its details
because I talked about these in the video on the rise of Hitler
In case you havent watched it Ill add the link in the description below
In 1929 came the Great Depression
This worsened the already bad unemployment situation
in 1933 6 million people were unemployed in Germany
Many people were homeless
Children were starving to death
As a result in 1933
Hitler declared himself the Dictator of Germany
After taking over full control of the country
Hitler started working on making his dream of a German Empire come true
German Reich
A state that would be racially pure
Its residents would be people of the Aryan race only
There would be no space for Jews and Slaviks
To fill people with hatred
they came up with the Judeo Bolshevism conspiracy theory
According to this conspiracy theory
the Russian Revolution in 1917
was supposedly caused by the Jews
Which eventually led to the formation of the Soviet Union
In 1935 the rest of the world came to know that
Germany had an air force
This might not seem like a big deal to you
after all every country has its air force
But friends the Treaty of Versailles laid down the condition
that Germany cannot have any form of military power
This was an open violation of the Treaty of Versailles by Hitler
But by this point in time many people in Britain believed that
the contents of the Treaty of Versailles
were very unfair to Germany
They were asking for such a large ransom
that crippled the country
And the country wasnt even allowed to have military
people consider it to be very demanding
In June 1935 Britain signed the AngloGerman Naval Agreement
This formally recognised that
Hilter had the authority to form his navy
Germany could have an independent navy
But the growing militarisation in Germany
alerted France
France built a 450 km long fortification on its Eastern border
This was named the Maginot Line
In 1938
when Hitler believed that his military was sufficiently prepared
he focused his attention on their neighbour Austria
Austria was a musthave country for Hitler
He wanted all Germanspeaking countries
to unite as one nation
His ultimate goal was not only to
conquer as many countries as possible to satisfy his pride
but also to acquire its resources
to advance his own country
The people Hitler believed to be racially superior
his Aryan race
he wanted to give them Lebensraum
To give them living space
So that they could live freely
In February 1938 Hitler met Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg
he was forced into signing an agreement
The agreement allowed Hitler to
place proNazi people on the Austrian government
The Austrian government was infiltrated
by appointing his own people
For example Dr Hans Fischbck
He was supposed to be the new finance minister of Austria
He was a Nazi
and the other Nazis who were in jail
were set free by him
Within a month things were out of control
Austrian Chancellor knew that if the infiltration was to be stopped
the people needed to be consulted first
Whether Austria should be an independent country
or be a united country with the Nazis
He decided to have a national vote for it
As soon as Hitler found out about the national vote
Hitler took his army and marched into Austria
The German military entered Vienna
But the Austrian Chancellor wanted no bloodshed
He resigned from his seat
Hitler used his propaganda ministry to spread fake news
Of riots happening in Vienna
And how the Communists were responsible for the riots
And so the Austrian government asked the German army
to help them protect Austria
The next day the Austrian Parliament was dissolved
And Austria ceased to be an independent country
This invasion was successful without any bloodshed
A major reason for this was that
at this point many people in Austria were in Hitlers favour
They were victims of the propaganda
They believed Hitlers invasion would help them
That Hitler could make their country into a superpower
After taking over Austria
Hitler moved on to the next country
On Czechoslovakias border there was the region
Of the people living here around 3 million were Germans
Hitler used that as an excuse to claim
that region as Germans
due to the Germans living there
Here British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain came into the picture
He wanted to avoid a war at all costs
He believed that if Hitler was given what he wanted
he would stay calm and there would be no wars
This is why in September 1938
the Munich Agreement was signed
The settlement of the Czechoslovakian problem
which has now been achieved
is in my view
only the prelude
There are larger settlements
in which all Europe may find peace
Under this agreement this region of the Sudetenland
was to be given to Germany
only if Hitler promised that there would be no more wars
Hitler gladly took this piece of Czechoslovakian land
but not even 1 year passed
before he violated the Munich Agreement
March 1939
Hitler took his army to invade the rest of Czechoslovakia
People fought for the first time
But the German army won easily
and the country was split into 2
One part was included in the German territerritory
and the second part was made a Nazi client state
A puppet government was placed
under the name of the Slovak Republic
British Prime Minister Chamberlain faced heavy criticism due to this
At this point in time Winston Churchill famously said
Hitler looked for the next country
To take control of Poland
in a sly move Hitler signed a NonAggression Pact with the Soviet Union
in 1939
At first glance youd think that Hitler hated
the Soviet Union and Communist ideology
So why would he do this?
The only reason for this was
to invade Poland
The Soviet Union wanted a part of Poland too
In this situation the interests of the two nations were aligned
On 1st September 1939
nearly 1 million German troops started moving towards Poland
They planned on attacking from the North and South simultaneously
Other countries were shocked at this
The UK and France were at the edge of their patience
If Hitler continued invading one country after the other
the next number could be theirs
How will the world cope?
They couldnt tolerate it any longer
The UK gave an ultimatum to Hitler
If they went ahead with Polands invasion
they would declare war against Germany
Hitler ignored the ultimatum
And with this the UK officially declared
a war against Germany
After this France Australia New Zealand
South Africa and Canada declared war on Germany too
UKs Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain
broadcasted this announcement on the radio
But friends at this point in time
World War II hadnt actually begun
This period is known as the Phony War
Because there was no real war yet
Though technically these countries had declared war on Germany
none of these countries
provided military support to Poland
Polands army was extremely oldfashioned
Their army still used horses
They couldnt last against Germanys military strategy
Neither Britain nor France could save them
Nearly 13 million people were mobilised in Poland
but it didnt even take 1 week for the German army to defeat them
On 8th September 1939
German troops occupied Poland
Friends here its important to mention
Hitlers revolutionary warfare strategy
Known as Blitzkrieg
Using this Hitler successfully invaded several countries
This military strategy focused on speed and stealth
They used tanks to invade the countries so quickly
that their opponents didnt have the time to think
And then their air force would join from above
It was known as Luftwaffe
And the invasion took place at a lightning speed
In German Blitz means lightning
Hitler focused on making the wars as small as possible
A war that could be wrapped up quickly
Within less than a week
To maintain this Blitzkrieg
German soldiers were given drugs
Thats right
A drug by the name of Pervitin was quite common
Today we know it as Crystal Meth
Confidential military communications
revealed that the Allies suspected that
the Nazis were using something
to supercharge their troops
But they had no idea what it was
When this drug is taken
it takes away fatigue
One doesnt need sleep
It suppresses hunger and thirst
reduces pain
and gives a confidence boost to the user
Giving such drugs to soldiers proved enormously advantageous
Even if it was extremely harmful to their longterm health
in the short term it was very useful in winning these wars
The defending soldiers would waste their time by sleeping at night
while the German soldiers could fight day and night
and finish the task within 23 days
As we move forward with the story youd see
how successful the Blitzkrieg military strategy was for Germany
Now back in Poland
Not only was Poland invaded by Hitler
but the Soviet Union was also invading it from the other side
After it was defeated it was partitioned into two
Half of it went to Nazi Germany
And the other half to the Soviets
The logic used by the Soviets was that
before the Russian Revolution
the area actually belonged to the Soviets
And so they deserved it
But from the Soviets perspective there was another country
which was a part of the Russian Empire before 1917
Stalin was worried that Germany would invade Finland
Stalin couldnt really trust Hitler
The worst problem with it wouldve been that
the city of Leningrad where Stalin resided
was only 50 km from the Finnish border
Had Finland been actually occupied by Nazi Germany
they wouldve been too close to Stalins home
So without waiting for Hitler to try to occupy Finland
the Soviet Union asks Finland to hand over their territory to the Soviets
Obviously Finland refused
And so the Soviets launched military action
against Finland in November 1939
What was Soviet leader Joseph Stalin thinking exactly?
What were his ideologies?

And now lets get back to the topic
This was an imbalanced war too
Soviet Unions army was much larger than Finlands
They had better equipment too
But this war lasted for more than 2 months
And the Soviets couldnt gain much
Finally in March 1940 this battle was over
And the Moscow Peace Treaty was signed
According to this 11 of Finlands land
would be handed over to the Soviet Union
In the meanwhile Hitlers focus wasnt actually on Finland
He was looking at Norway and Denmark
In April 1940 Hitler prepared his plans
on how he could establish control over Norway and Denmark
On 9th April 1940
Hitler used his Blitzkrieg strategy
to invade Norway and Denmark
This invasion didnt last long either
Both were small countries
How could they compete against the German Army?
The Norwegian government fled to London
and in London a Government in Exile was set up
In Norway Hitler established his puppet proNazi government
British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain
accepted his failure
The failure to protect so many neighbouring countries
from the Nazi invasion
Due to this on 10th May 1940
he resigned from the position of Prime Minister
The seat of the Prime Minister and its responsibilities
were handed over to the infamous Winston Churchill
On the same day 10th May
Hitler launched an attack on
France Belgium Netherlands and Luxembourg
This was a declaration of an allout war
Everyone could see that Hitler didnt intend to stop
At the beginning of the video I told you
how France had built the Maginot Line because they were worried
that Hitler would attack their country
They were building a wall at the border
The French troops lined the wall
to protect their country
is the fate of Holland and Belgium
like that of Poland
and Czechoslovakia
and Austria
will be decided by the victory
of the British Empire
On the borders of Belgium and Luxembourg
the Allied forces were stationed to protect them
Hitler used his trademark Blitzkrieg strategy
More than 1000 fighter bomber airplanes
around 3 million soldiers on the ground as the offence for Germany
this was known as the Battle of France
The German troops were divided into 3 groups
A B and C
Group B was to attack the Netherlands
And then enter Belgium to fight the Allied forces
Group C was to attack the Maginot Line
And are you wondering what was Group A supposed to do?
Group A was the master plan
Group Cs attack on Maginot Line
was merely a distraction
so that Group A could sneakily execute the master plan
Entering France through the Ardennes Forest
This was a vast forest
was believed to be a strong fortress by Frances military experts
They assumed that the German army would never be able to come through it
because it would be too difficult
They didnt expect the German army to invade via this forest
More than 40000 military vehicles were used
by Group A to enter France through this forest
On 15th May 1940
they captured Sedan
and started travelling Northwards
The British army fighting Group B in Belgium
were shocked to see the suddenness
with which the large force attacked them from behind
The soldiers were surrounded by the Nazi army from three sides
They had only 1 way to escape
Through the sea
Near the port of Dunkirk
So they planned to escape from there
What happened in Dunkirk was a historical turn of events in WWII
Nearly 400000 allied troops were stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk
When Im using the term Allied
it basically refers to the British and French armies
The countries fighting Hitler
their group or their collation is known as the Allies
And the countries fighting in support of Hitler
are known as the Axis Powers
It was crucial to save the Allied soldiers in time
because the Nazi army was moving towards them at great speeds
They had no other way of escape
They could evacuate only through the sea
If this couldnt be done in time 400000 troops could be killed there
It wouldve been a huge drawback for Britain and France
They might have lost their countries forever
Winston Churchill made a plan to evacuate the soldiers
On 26th May 1940
Operation Dynamo was launched
The biggest evacuation in military history
On land the German army had reached the beaches
They were firing at the troops
The German airforce was attacking from above
Christopher Nolan made the amazing film Dunkirk
which masterfully depicts the events that took place there
This film focuses on 3 areas of evacuation
First British Royal Air Forces counter attack
The British ships which were coming to evacuate the Allied soldiers
were given cover by the British air force
To protect the ships
Second some private fishing boats in the English Channel
and the common civilians joined in to help in the evacuation
And third the events that took place on Dunkirks beach
The soldiers trying to save themselves
and helping each other
4th June 1940
Nearly 350000 soldiers were successfully evacuated
As you wouldve seen in the film as well
But the bad news was that
most of the military equipment of the Allied forces was used up in this evacuation
Some days later on 22nd June 1940
France surrendered to Hitler
By this point in time in Italy
was under the rule of Dictator Mussolini
He formed an alliance with Hitler
to wage war against France
The alliance of Italy and Germany
was known as the Pact of Steel
The two countries declared war against France and Britain
on 10th June
By July 1940 the situation was that
Hitler had established control over nearly all neighbouring countries
Austria Poland Denmark
Norway Belgium
Luxembourg the Netherlands
and France
At this point in time
Hitlers Germany Britain and the Soviet Union
Germany and the Soviet Union had a Peace Agreement
So Hitler neednt be wary of the Soviet Union
He believed that the Soviets wouldnt attack Germany
He thought that Britain was the only remaining fighting Germany
Youd be wondering about Americas role
Friends America wasnt involved in WWII yet
America was standing back
because after World War I
America wasnt interested in
interfering with Europes situation
It was clear that
had they stopped fighting at this point in time
Hitler wouldve been the clear victor
Hitler had a major upper hand
So how did the situation take a Uturn?
And Britain could defeat Germany?
We shall fight on the landing grounds
We shall fight in the fields
and in the streets
We shall fight in the hills
We shall never surrender!!
Friends lets talk continue this story in the next video
part 2 of the video on World War II
I know what youre thinking
this might sound vague to you
that youd have to wait months for the part 2
dont worry about that
I wont torment you with the suspense for too long
Because this time around both videos were shot together
and edited together
Till then you can watch this video
in which I explained how Hitler used propaganda
to brainwash German citizens
Basically the way Hitler took over the government and control
Theres an interesting angle to this story
involving Albert Einstein
You can click here to watch it
And Ill see you in the next video
Thank you very much!
