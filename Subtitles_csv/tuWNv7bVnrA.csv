Tell me son why is your head down?
You used to laugh a lot why are you silent now?
People front of our doors with boards
I know very well who they are and their motives
Among them some are here to shine silver
Some want to grab you and pull you down
Some are framewhores
Some wants the spotlight by saying your name
Tough times always come to strong men
Dont fall back the world will enjoy it
And the path you are walking on
Youll get high rated defamation
Everyday controversy will be created
With the excuse of religion youll get a debate
If you speak the truth youll get 295 Criminal code 295  intent to insult religion
And if you are successful then youll get hate
Everyday controversy will be created
With the excuse of religion youll get a debate
If you speak the truth youll get 295 Criminal code 295  intent to insult religion
And if you are successful then youll get hate
Lots of people grouped together to save our culture
Literally everybody gets up and gives lectures
And i feel like even god has surrendered
When i read newspapers in the morning
Stay quite son dont reveal the secrets
Leaders here deserve to be shot
And people who name their kids John and Steve
Are trying to become saviours of our mother language
These arent lies they are the facts of here
Robbers are disguised as social workers
And those that loot people in the attire of truth
They will all be punished soon
Everyday controversy will be created
With the excuse of religion youll get a debate
If you speak the truth youll get 295 Criminal code 295  intent to insult religion
And if you are successful then youll get hate
Everyday controversy will be created
With the excuse of religion youll get a debate
If you speak the truth youll get 295 Criminal code 295  intent to insult religion
And if you are successful then youll get hate
People throw rocks at trees filled with fruits
Within minutes they reach the mothers womb
Whos dog whos a pimp and whos evil
Here these certificates are given on facebook
Politicians give bribes to get votes from them
They take their votes and the voters are slapped
Dont know where their conscience is then
They dont speak they are shameless
People applaud when they see you fall
They keep long beardsReligious Tradition and spew hatred
And what is the difference in your mother and his People using mothers to insult
They will learn this a bit late
Everyday controversy will be created
With the excuse of religion youll get a debate
If you speak the truth youll get 295 Criminal code 295  intent to insult religion
And if you are successful then youll get hate
You are here because of your dedication
They arent here taking pictures because of your face
How much someone here believes in god
People judge it based off of their actions
You may have bent but you never blow down
You have a turban on your head you are not bald
Ask one thing from these contractors of religion
Religion is ours not just yours alone
Get rid of dirty politics from your heart
At least leave people alone to go to the temple
You wont find any kids with long hair Religious tradition
Other wise you will soon see those days
Everyday controversy will be created
With the excuse of religion youll get a debate
If you speak the truth youll get 295 Criminal code 295  intent to insult religion
And if you are successful then youll get hate
Illitrate people run todays media
They tell the same lie over and over again
They sit with women and gossip
And call the show Chajj da Vichar Informative Discussion
All day and night they look for drama
Without reason they quarrel with you
They condemn you 24 hours a day
Yet they know all of your songs by heart
Even though the crowd is hard on you
They yell at you without reason
Remember one thing my son
Your father is very proud of you
Youve been suppressed the world is in mistaken
Get up my wrestler son moosewala
If you continue speaking the truth in your songs
You will find an educated new generation
Everyday controversy will be created
With the excuse of religion youll get a debate
If you speak the truth youll get 295 Criminal code 295  intent to insult religion
And if you are successful then youll get hate
