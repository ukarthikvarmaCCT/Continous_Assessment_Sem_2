Hello friends!
Recently I made a video on the film Animal
in which I called it a cancer for society
After watching it some people asked  What about toxic feminism?
Are feminist films not bad for society?
So come in this video lets know about
feminism and patriarchy in depth in detail
What is Feminism?
How does feminism impact our society?
And how are men suffering because of it?
Feminine gender masculine gender neutral
in Hindi it is known as Streeling and Puling
those words have now being
given a new meaning
Often on social media
whenever we talk about topics like  masculinity patriarchy and feminism
you must have heard people saying that
these girls these women or these boys are always like this
Such arguments are raised a lot
that girls are at fault in many instances
that women do this and that
Its as if a Team Boys and Team Girls are opposing each other
All the men are in one team
and women are in the other team
Think about it is it not strange?
That males and females are always divided into two different teams
Every house has a mother a daughter a sister or a wife
So while using such arguments
how can we say things like  girls are always like this
or that women are always like this
On the other hand it doesnt make sense  to group all men into one team
There are men who throw acid on girls
if she refuses them
Would you like to be in the same team with them?
The real division that exists here is
between patriarchal people and feminist people
What do these words mean?
Lets take a look at the dictionary
Patriarchy is a social system
where men have control over women
In Hindi patriarchy can be called as
Purush Pradhan Samajik Vyavastha Maledominated social structure
A system where all power is held by men
So what is the definition of Feminism?
Does Feminism mean a society
where the power is in the hands of women?
The definition of feminism is something else
Feminism is an ideology
which believes that there should be
political economic and social  equality between men and women
Women should be given equal  rights and opportunities as men
So even though the word Feminism  is derived from the word Female
it doesnt mean that
women are given more power than men
Theres another word for that Matriarchy
This is the equivalent of Patriarchy
Where men are considered superior to women in Patriarchy
in Matriarchy women are considered superior to men
But Feminism means that
there is no discrimination between the two genders
Now you must be thinking
does this mean that a man can also be a feminist?
In fact any rational and sensible man
will be a Feminist
Former US President Barack Obama once wrote an essay
in which he called himself a Feminist
When the legendary author Salman Rushdie was asked
if he was a feminist he replied
Yes what else is there to be?
Either you are a feminist or a fool
These are the only choices
When Hollywood filmmaker Darren  Aronofsky was asked the same question
he replied that it was a stupid question
Of course he is a feminist
Indian actor Rahul Bose had a similar answer to this question
He said of course he is a feminist
Anyone who believes in humanity  naturally is a feminist
Several famous male celebrities
openly call themselves Feminists
Hollywood actors Chris Hemsworth Ryan Gosling
in the Indian film industry
Farhan Akhtar Aamir Khan
Often they have talked about the issue
that men and women should be given equal rights
But the next question is
can women be patriarchal?
The answer to this is yes absolutely
There was a documentary called The World Before Her
I would like to show you a clip from it
Vishwa Hindu Parishad had organised  a Durga Vahini camp for women
The instructor was a woman
She is asking the girls
is it really necessary for them to leave their houses?
Make a career?
Is it truly necessary?
This way of thinking goes against common sense
Why would a woman choose to have inequal rights?
But the truth is
many women in our country have these patriarchal ideologies
It is all due to Social Conditioning
In this video the woman tells how
her mother slapped her in her childhood
when she saw herself in the mirror
She was told that knowing how to read and write is enough
She doesnt need higher education
There are many reasons for such  patriarchal views all over the world
Like this is our tradition
our culture
or our religion teaches us this
In society people often have strong opinions about
how an ideal woman should be
While the husband is the incarnation of God
ABP News had quoted Garud Puran in its article
that a good wife is the one who
follows her husbands orders
For a wife heaven is at her husbands feet
For any woman her familys happiness is her happiness
A woman is incomplete without becoming a mother
You must have often heard people  around you saying these things
A woman is made up of her sacrifices
If there are 4 slices of cake left
and there are 5 people
then a woman would always say that
she doesnt like cake and asks the others to go ahead
What else is commonly said?
If a girl studies more  she will get out of hand
It doesnt look good for girls to laugh loudly
A girl should be homely and wellbehaved
Such things are very common in our society
And the mass media encourages these
These socalled ideal daughterinlaw characters
in Ekta Kapoors TV serials
Always portrays regressive thinking about women
Or watch Sandeep Vangas films like  Animal or Kabir Singh
These affect our societyas
many girls want to fit into this ideal woman standard
and start accepting these views
They do this so that
they get accepted by society and their family
In psychology this phenomenon is  known as Normative Conformity
In school when teenagers often  become victims of peer pressure
its because of this phenomenon
An example of this on a smaller scale can be that
if you are sitting in a group  and someone is making a joke
Everyone starts laughing at that joke
But you dont find that joke funny
You dont want to laugh at the joke
But you choose to laugh
so that you can be a part of that group
So that you can conform to the standards of the group
Normative conformity
Many women adopt these patriarchal  ideas to gain acceptance in society
This is why throughout history
we have seen many women
who were protesting against womens equal rights
In the video on Napoleon I told you that
the leftwing revolutionaries of France at that time
were against womens rights too
They implemented the Declaration of the Rights  of Man and of the Citizen
but women were not given rights
A Jacobin politician Chaumette had said that
men have been given duties by nature
to hunt to farm to become politicians
but women have been given duties to
take care of the house and of motherhood
He called it shameless
for women to be demanding political rights for themselves
Do they want to be a man?
Many women agreed with this opinion at that time
Even 100 years later
in London in 1908
there was a woman who formed the  Womens National AntiSuffrage League
Her name was Mary and she told people
not to address her by her name
rather to address her by her husbands name
Her husbands name was Humphrey Ward
So she called herself Mrs Humphrey Ward
She was not an illiterate woman
In fact she was a bestselling novelist
She was internationally famous
She had promoted womens education in Oxford
But she was staunchly against giving women voting rights
She believed that only men can
solve constitutional legal financial  military and international problems
And then 70 years later
in 1972 which is literally only 50 years ago
America was about to pass the Equal Rights Amendment
to give equal rights to women and men
But there was a woman who opposed it
An American lawyer Phyllis Schlafly
She mobilised more women
to protest against this law
Even now where many women have  made history in different fields
women like Kalpana Chawla  have done space exploration
Women are becoming scientists
some women still hold on to patriarchal thinking
There are women who say that
feminism is useless
How can men and women be equal?
Their argument is that men  and women have different anatomies
Men cant give birth to children
So how can they be equal?
Feminism is baseless
claiming women are equal to men
there is no need to believe such stuff
Thats my opinion
We are not equal
Only the day men start getting pregnant
will we be equal
We cannot be equal
These arguments are very illogical
It is true that in male and female anatomy
23 organs may differ
But there are at least 7075 organs
that are the same in male and female anatomies
Two eyes one nose two ears
its the same for men and women
It is true that their gender is different
but its not like women belong to a different species
Both are homo sapiens
And in English two words are used here
similar and equal
To get equal rights
you dont have to be equal
being similar is good enough
Nature creates diversity
but it doesnt create discrimination
It creates differences
but it doesnt create discrimination
Nature creates diversity
but not hierarchy not inequality
The diversity created by nature
is transformed into discrimination and inequality by society
Women give birth to children
so they get maternity leave
But when women work in the office
they should be paid equally to men
How is there any sort of confusion in this?
Yes men and women are not totally similar to one another
But a black man and a white man  are not totally similar to one another
A man who can walk on his two legs
and a man who is sitting in a wheelchair
are not totally similar to each other
There is a difference between a smart man and a stupid man
But equal rights are given to everyone
Because of these differences
it is not said that certain kinds  of men should not get equal rights
In every human being
there are small differences in comparison to other people
But this does not mean that
those who can walk on two legs
should be given voting rights
and those who need a wheelchair should not be
These differences cannot be the reason for not giving equal rights
So we come back to the same point
The feminist struggle
is not a men versus women scenario
rather it is about patriarchal people  versus feminist people
And this is not just a fight for equal rights for women
but also a fight for the rights of men
You heard it right Mens Rights
Patriarchy is the reason behind many mens issues
It may sound confusing
but let me explain it with an example
If I tell you friends unemployed youth
imagine a picture of a jobless person in your mind
What picture did you imagine?
You must have imagined a jobless man
You must have imagined a jobless boy
Not a girl
This is because in our society
we often see that if a girl is jobless
she can still get married
She can become a housewife
But if a boy is jobless
that becomes very problematic
The pressure of not being unemployed
is much higher for men than for women
The patriarchal ideology says that
women will work at home
and men will have to earn money
And if a woman is working and earning
then the man will have to earn more than her
Otherwise what will people say?
People will accuse him of living off of his girlfriend
They will criticise him as a man
For being a man who lives off of a womans money
That he should be ashamed
Taunting him about his wife who earns more than him
And as I told you earlier
many women and girls are victims of this patriarchal mindset
Even they say that they want a husband
who earns more than them
They will refuse an arranged marriage
if the boy does not earn more than them
And this same patriarchal mindset
is also present in mens height
Tall women like tall men
But short women also like tall men
If by chance the wifes height is more than her husbands height
then people criticise the man for being shorter than his wife
They make fun of the couple
They laugh at the man
All because of the same backward patriarchal thinking
If you are a man
suppose you are in your car with your wife or girlfriend
and a car comes and hits your car
Even though its his fault he gets  out of his car and starts shouting at you
So what would you do in such a situation?
Most people will get out of their car
and start shouting at the other person
But Gautam Buddha said
He gave me abuses I didnt take them
So the abuses remained with him
If you choose to ignore the negativity someone throws at you
the negativity will remain with them
Such thinking makes sense  only to a sensible man
But what does patriarchal thinking say?
If someone insulted you in front of your wife
and you just left after hearing it
what kind of a man are you?
You should have broken his face
You are a coward
what will your wife think about you?
And because of this patriarchal mindset
society forces that man to engage with the one insulting him
and fight with them
Will fighting solve the problem?
Not at all
Imagine that other driver is like  Ranvijay from the film Animal
A rich man who doesnt care about the law
he carries a revolver or a baseball bat with him
What will you do then?
Even in frustration youll turn around and apologise to him
Your male ego will be hurt
People will still make fun of you
As a man who was beaten up
Just for apologising
Many research papers prove that
men are more likely to get into fights than women
In 2022 the State of UK Boys report was released which showed
how violence is normalised
and it is believed that when a boy grows up
violence is a natural part of growing up
But the problem isnt limited to the violence
but also of mens loneliness
Now you must be wondering
how is this possible?
How is mens loneliness related to  feminism and patriarchy?
But there is a strong relation friends
The patriarchal mindset does not allow a man to cry
If a man cries society mocks him
for being a man who cries
Theres the saying Boys dont cry
Forget about crying
patriarchal thinking does not let men  express any negative emotion
If a boy talks to his male friends  about his problems and stress
he is considered emotionally weak
He is told that he is getting emotional like girls
In our society what are the activities  to express male friendships?
Boys like to watch movies with their male friends
play cricket or party with each other
But womens friendships are more intimate and emotional
Girls talk more openly with their friends
express their problems
But if a boy does this
society will not accept him
This is the reason why
mens loneliness becomes a separate issue
When a boy feels depressed
he is forced to hide his depression
Openly expressing any kind of grief  any kind of emotional problem
is not considered acceptable in society
So much emotional castration friends
that he is deprived of emotional intelligence
And what does this result in?
If you look at global data for people dying by su!cide
then the rate among men is much higher than that of women
Even in India according to the governments NCRB data
the rate of su!cide among men
is 25 times higher than that of women
What is the reason behind these problems?
Patriarchal thinking and patriarchy
Thats why when feminists say
Smash the Patriarchy
it doesnt mean that they are against men
Patriarchy is a way of thinking that
is destroying the lives of both men and women
When we talk about feminism in India
Kamla Bhasins name comes up a lot
7 years ago she gave this TEDx talk
in which she explained how patriarchy dehumanises men
You are not allowed to cry
Your mother passed away
But boys are not allowed to cry
Emotional castration

Apart from this these issues have been raised often internationally
Like Cassie Jayes famous TEDx talk
which has more than 10 million views
A Feminist Talking About Mens Rights
There is no denying that there are many
human rights issues
that uniquely or disproportionately affect men
Angelica Ferrara from Stanford University
wrote the book Men Without Men
This book explains how mens loneliness is a feminist issue
Taking a look at history we should  consider Raja Ram Mohan Roy a feminist
because he campaigned against Sati
And Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar
who promoted widow remarriage
Our social reformers were not against men
but wanted to give equal rights to women
And if we talk about Indian feminists
how can we forget Savitribai Phule?
Indias one of the greatest feminists
She established the first girls school  with her friend Fatima Sheikh
She had to bear so much anger from society
that people used to throw cow dung at them
She used to take a spare saree with her to school
Was Savitribai Phule against men?
Obviously not
In fact it was her husband Jyotirao Phule
who taught her
If you want to know more about Savitribai Phule

If we talk about history
feminism is divided into three waves
The first wave of feminism came in the 1800s and early 1900s
This was the time when women demanded to have political rights
Right to vote
Before this women did not have the right to vote
In the French Revolution a political activist Olympe de Gouges
drafted a document
the Declaration of the Rights of Women and of the Female Citizen
She is considered one of the first feminists in the world
The second wave of feminism came around the 1960s
This focused on the issue of ending gender discrimination in their households
During this time a slogan was raised by the famous feminist Carol Hanisch
The Personal is Political
Many legal and social rights were given to women
After this came the third wave of feminism
which started in the 1990s
This focused on the issues of intersectional feminism
That is feminism is not only for upperclass white women
rather poor and black women should get the same rights
But do you know what the problem is?
The boys who present themselves as alpha males on social media
they will not talk about any of these  issues while talking about feminism
They will make fun of feminism
by using these films
Wherever you see these films are compared to feminism
As if feminism means nothing else but these films
When I made a video on the film Animal
some people asked why critics always  criticise films like Animal and Kabir Singh
Why arent such films criticised?
But if you look at the critics reviews of these films
I named two film critics in the Animal video
Anupama Chopra and Sucharita Tyagi
I saw Anupama Chopras review of Four More Shorts
She said this for the first two seasons of the show
I never made it past episode 2 of Season 1 of Four More Shots Please
In her review written on her portal Film Companion
she said that this show shows a superficial form of feminism
That its a poorly written TV show
What did Sucharita have to say about Thank You For Coming?
That this is a largely unwatchable film
Thank You For Coming is a film
only masquerading as a feminist romp
While mostly being a masculine gaze
on how women probably maybe live their lives
That though the films pretends to be a feminist romp
it is presented from a masculine gaze
A person who understands feminism properly
for them it is obvious that
these films have nothing to do with feminism
Its true that film producers force words like Feminism in more and more films
but what is portrayed in the films has nothing to do with Feminism
Feminism doesnt mean that women
go out and smoke drink or objectify men
This is not feminism
Actually the real feminist films
theres no dearth of them in Bollywood
The only difference is that
the alpha men on social media
dont relate feminism to those films
Like this film Pink
This is a real feminist film
It clearly shows that
drinking doesnt equate to women empowerment
But the problem is that
when a man drinks alcohol it affects his liver
But when a woman drinks alcohol
it becomes a character certificate for her
Other than this there are films like The Great Indian Kitchen
Tumhari Sulu Queen English Vinglish
Dor Mirch Masala
These people will never talk about such films
Then there are films like Thappad
Many alpha males criticised this film saying that
the wife got a divorce just because of a slap
they said that this is not realistic
This cant be real
And no one should do this
But think about it if the story was reversed
At a party had a wife slapped her husband in front of everyone
The same people would say that it is grounds for divorce
The man should divorce her because of it
Then there is a very popular meme of Neha Dhupia
In an episode of Roadies
when she said that its her choice
Its her choice
Of course Yeah?
Nobody gives you the right to slap a girl!
When the boy did something wrong he was criticised
But in another episode when the girl did the same thing
Neha justified it and said that
its her choice
Neha was criticised a lot for this
and she was mocked
And its obvious that
what she said was a very hypocritical
But you know what?
Most of the alpha male incels on Instagram
show the same hypocrisy
You must have seen many of these guys showing off that
they have girls in Delhi one in Mumbai and one in Punjab
And then they use memes like
Boys will be boys men will be men
But if the girl cheats on them
then they cant tolerate it
It becomes too much for them to bear
That becomes toxic feminism
But on the other hand boys will be boys
When boys are in the wrong boys will be boys
You can see hypocrisy on both sides
And both sides are wrong
But did any feminist ever say that
what Neha Dhupia said was right?
No one said that
But again and again feminism
is tried to be equated to that statement
It is related to wrong things
There was a case in Lucknow  where a girl misbehaved with a boy
and beat him up repeatedly
It was found that the girl apparently was from a rich family
and the boy belonged to a poor family
What happened was entirely wrong
It is not right to beat anyone
But did any feminist show their support for this girl?
No one did
But still what is shown on social media repeatedly
is that this is feminism
Why do incels relate feminism to these problematic issues?
And never talks about real feminism?
The reason is very simple
They dont want equal rights for men and women
They want to promote the same patriarchal mindset
and want to discredit the entire feminist movement
These people spread lies that feminists hate all men
That feminists want women to leave men forever
But the real feminism that I talked about in the first half of this video
will never be discussed
So friends I hope this video helped you understand
the real meaning of feminism
and why Smash Patriarchy is important for boys and men
Because we want to see a world where
men and women have equal rights to be free
in terms of equal rights and opportunities
A society where
men are not pressurised into suppressing their emotions
Now if you want to understand the ideology of equality in details
how the ideas of liberty and equality were born historically
how these ideas spread all over the world
I have talked it in this video
in which I have explained the French Revolution in detail
You can click here to watch it
Thank you very much!
