Hello friends!
24th November 1971
In America a Northwest Orient Airlines flight
took off from Portland
This is a small 30minute flight
to Seattle city nearby
Not many passengers were on this flight
It was carrying only 36 passengers  and 6 crew members
But these passengers were unaware that
a hijacker was present on this flight
A man named DB Cooper
The hijacker looked like a normal businessman
He was dressed like that
A business suit white shirt and black pants
He must have been in his midforties
He intentionally sat in the last row of the plane
Seat number 18E
As soon as the plane took off
this guy introduced himself to an air hostess
He mentions his name Dan Cooper
The hostesss name was Florence Schaffner
And with a big smile he handed a note to the air hostess
Schaffner was a 23yearold woman
who thought that this man was trying to flirt with her
So she took that note
and kept it with her without reading it
Seeing this Cooper told her
that she should read the note
He said that he had a b0mb
When Schaffner opened the note
it was clearly written in neat handwriting
Miss I have a b0mb in my briefcase
and I want you to sit by me
Schaffner quietly sat next to Cooper
but she still couldnt believe that
he actually had a bomb
So Cooper opened his suitcase to show it to her
Some red cylinders wires
and a big cylindrical battery were in the suitcase
There was no doubt that it was a b0mb
Cooper made his demands to the air hostess
He wanted 200000 by 5 pm that evening
That too in cash
He wanted all that cash in a bag
along with 2 parachutes in the back  and 2 parachutes in the front
When they eventually landed
he wanted to have a fuel truck ready to refuel the plane
He warned her against trying anything strange
threatening to blow up the plane otherwise
The other passengers on the plane were unaware of this
and Air Hostess Schaffner didnt want
the other passengers to know
She quietly went into the cockpit
and showed Coopers note to the pilots
Another Air Hostess Tina Mucklow was informed about this
and she sat beside Cooper
With the help of these two air hostesses
the contact between the planes cockpit  and Cooper could be maintained
The pilots informed the air traffic controller
and soon the news reached the president of the airline
Donald Nairob
He was the decisionmaker
and he made an interesting decision
He told the staff to ensure full compliance with Coopers demands
To fulfil all demands made by this hijacker
After coordinating with the FBI
he talked to a Seattle bank to arrange the money
The bank had a huge bundle of  money for such emergencies
But there was something special about this bundle of money
We will talk about it later in the video
But you must be wondering
why did the airlines president
decide to cooperate with the hijackers?
The reason behind this was Reputation
The airlines president didnt want
the news of the hijack to spread all over the world
leading to heavy losses for his company
So to keep this issue under wraps
he was willing to fulfil the demands of the hijackers
The only problem was that
they needed some time to arrange the money
but this flight was only supposed to be half an hour long
So the pilots were told that
instead of landing the plane
they were to keep circling around Seattle
until they could arrange the money on the ground
This halfhour flight gradually became 3 hours long
Passengers were still unaware of what was happening
Flight pilots announced that
they were facing minor technical difficulties
causing the delay
The other passengers believed this
Finally this flight landed at  Seattles airport at 546 pm
According to Coopers instructions
the plane was parked far from the main terminal building
One airline representative approached the plane
with a bag of money and the parachutes
When the 4 parachutes and the bag of money
was given to Cooper
he allowed the passengers and flight attendants
to leave the plane
except Tina Mucklow
After this according to the plan the plane was refuelled
and it takes off again
This time only the pilots were on the plane
along with Cooper and Tina
Cooper started giving instructions to the pilots again
For the destination of the flight the speed of the flight
down to the very angle
He directs them to fly the plane towards Mexico City
At an altitude of 10000 feet in the air
With the wings positioned at 15
As for the planes speed
he wanted to fly as slow as possible
The pilots told Cooper that
flying with these configurations
would make it difficult for them to reach Mexico City
Because there wasnt enough fuel in the plane
But Cooper was not worried about it
Cooper told them to fly as he directed
Friends what happened next is completely unbelievable
No less than a films story
Cooper told Tina to go to the cockpit and lock the door
Cooper was the only person outside the cockpit
He took out his parachutes and prepared to dive
A few minutes later
a warning light flashed in the cockpit
indicating that the rear staircase had been deployed
This was a unique feature in these planes back then
Boeing 727 planes had an aft staircase at the back
In the photos you can see how
the stairs deployed from the back
Cooper deployed these stairs
and jumped out with the parachutes and the money
The pilots and the air hostesses did not see this happening
because they were locked in the cockpit
and back then there was no hole on the cockpit door
through which they could see outside
But at 813 pm pilots noticed that
the back part of the plane suddenly tilted upwards
and the pilots had to recalibrate and relevel the plane
After this the pilots flew the plane to Nevada  and landed in the city of Reno
The police were informed
and they investigated the plane
But they didnt find any trace of Cooper
The only things the police could find was a tie
with a clip on it
and some torn parts of the parachutes
which Cooper had used to cover the bag of money
Apart from this they found some personal items belonging to Cooper
like the cigarettes he was smoking on the plane
Smoking was allowed in aeroplanes back then
Investigators investigated everything thoroughly
and they found 66 unidentified fingerprints
Fingerprints belonging to neither the crew members
nor to the other passengers
But the suitcase that had the b0mb
the bag of money and the parachutes
were all missing like Cooper
From that day the FBI started its investigation to find Cooper
but no trace of Cooper was found
This investigation went on for 45 years
It was officially closed in 2016
but the answers to many questions
are still unanswered
This is the only hijack in history
that no one has been able to solve
One of the greatest mysteries for the FBI
Who was Cooper?
What happened to him?
Was the money ever recovered by the police?
There are too many questions
Lets try to unravel this mystery
2 things are very interesting about this incident
First during this hijack
no other passenger knew that their plane was hijacked
Neither was anyone k!lled
nor was anyone injured in this hijack
Many people claim this was due to Tina Mucklow
They call her the hero of this hijack
because she was the one to ensure that
Cooper remained calm throughout the flight
his demands were met
and no panic situation could be created
which could cause a ruckus or get someone injured
The copilot of the plane Rataczak later said
She was so calm and cool and collected
I could not think of anyone
that would have been better
to have sitting next to someone  who would do a criminal act like this
The second interesting thing was that
the name DB Cooper
As I told you in the beginning
that guys name was actually Dan Cooper
But today most people
call this the Mystery of DB Cooper
How did Dan become DB?
This is because of a mistake by a news reporter
Back then there was a reporter named James Long
who was late for meeting his deadline
So in a hurry
while talking to his police source
he misheard the name
The police said that
the hijackers name was Dan Cooper
but this reporter heard DB Cooper
and used this name for his news report
This report was picked up by other journalists
while talking about this news  in their newspapers and channels
started using the name DB Cooper
DB Cooper
This is how the name of the hijacker changed
In psychology this phenomenon is known as Anchoring
Anchoring is a cognitive bias that states
humans rely too heavily on the first piece of information
The first piece of news you hear about any breaking news
you have the tendency to believe it
In 2013 a joke theory related to this was published
Brandolinis Law
also called the Bullshit Asymmetry Principle
It states that correcting this anchoring effect can be very difficult
The amount of energy needed to correct bullshit
is of much higher magnitude than to produce it
In broad terms
spreading lies is relatively easier
but having people believe the truth to correct that lie
is much more difficult
But in case of Cooper
it wasnt a huge mistake
Only the name was wrong
Anyway a hijacker shouldnt be expected to use his real name
FBIs initial investigations showed that
when Cooper jumped out of the plane
Cooper had strapped the cash around him
The cash weighed around 10 kilos
Cooper used two parachutes to jump
one strapped in front and one behind
The police had an idea of the area in which Cooper jumped
He jumped in the southwest area of Washington State
There were pine forests lakes and canyons in the area
bears lived there
So in the beginning the investigators said that
there was no chance of Cooper surviving
Jumping from a height of 10000 feet
and in pitch darkness
It was completely dark at 8 in the night
Second the clothes that Cooper was wearing
were not at all suitable for jumping
Jumping in pants and shirt
when it was raining outside
With heavy black clouds in the sky
at the height of 5000 feet
It means that Cooper could not see anything while falling
On top of that the wind speed was important too
It was estimated that when Cooper jumped
he had to be travelling at the speed of 320 km per hour
The United States Parachute Association believed that
there was another problem on top of all this
the cold water
In November the temperature  in this American region is very low
If Cooper had fallen into a lake
it would have been almost impossible to escape from there
In such cold water hypothermia  would have set in within a few minutes
And on top of that the weight strapped on Cooper
would have made it more difficult to swim
But despite all these
some such reasons surfaced later
which force us to think that
perhaps Cooper survived this jump
The reason for this was that after Coopers incident
there were many similar incidents
When Coopers hijacking made news all across the country
more hijackers thought of using the same tactics
At least 5 people did the same copycat hijackings
And all these 5 people
survived after jumping off the plane
One of them was Martin McNally
who hijacked a plane on 24th June 1972
He used the exact same modus operandi
He demanded a sum of 500000
When the plane took off
they used a parachute to jump off like Cooper
In McNallys case the speed of the plane  was around 400500 km per hour
when he jumped
This was twice the speed of Coopers dive
But still McNally survived his jump
using only a reserve parachute
Another similar hijack was done in January 1972
by Richard Lapoint
He wore similar clothes in January
jumped and landed safely in the snow
Its irrelevant that these two hijackers
were later caught by the police
Thats how we know their stories
But the FBI thought that
if these people could jump
in conditions that were worse than when Cooper jumped
and they managed to survive
then it was possible that DB Cooper survived that night
Especially if you consider that
when Tina Mucklow gave the parachutes to Cooper
there were instructions on how to use them
But Cooper told Tina that
she didnt need to read the instructions
He knew how to use them
So now since the FBI started assuming that
Cooper could be alive
their next task was to
search the place where he had jumped
Actually the police had started searching  those jungles the day after the hijack
The police were looking for a body a torn piece of the parachutes
or a 20 bill
At the beginning of the video I told you
that the money given to Cooper was special
The special thing was that
there were 20 bills
10000 notes of 20
200000 in total
And the serial numbers of these notes
were noted down by the bank
The FBI spread the list of serial numbers throughout the country
From banks to casinos
everyone was told to inform the FBI  if they got the notes of those serial numbers
But it was becoming more and more  difficult for the investigators to find Copper
because where could the search area be drawn?
There were many variables
What was the wind speed while the plane was flying?
How dark was it?
What was the exact location of the plane
when Cooper jumped?
After jumping at what height did Cooper deploy his parachutes?
And in which directions could the parachutes have gone?
The investigators best estimate was that
it would have landed somewhere  near Lake Merwin in Washington State
The FBI ran a practical experiment
If we fly the same aircraft with the same configurations
and push out a 91 kg sled through the stairs
based on where the sled landed
we can get a better idea of
the area where Cooper could have landed
Due to this doortodoor searches were conducted in this area
The local farmhouses
the police used to knock on every door
to investigate and to ask people
Petrol boats were running on Lake Mervin and Lake Yale
One company used their submarine for the search
200 ft under the Lake Mervin
they continued to look for him
They wanted to find either the money  a piece of the parachute or a body
but they couldnt find anything
Eventually the investigators
published the serial numbers of the notes in the local newspaper
They ran the news that the first person  to find a note from those serial numbers
would be awarded 1000
This offer remained for 3 years
but not a single note could be found
Now lets skip to 1979
8 years since the hijack
Suddenly a pilot contacted the FBI
His name was Tom Bohan  and he worked for Continental Airlines
The night of the hijack
4 minutes behind Coopers aircraft  and 4000 feet above
another aircraft was flying
which was being flown by Tom
Tom recalled the storm that night
and said that he had never seen  such a storm in his entire career
He said that the FBIs calculations
regarding Coopers drop zone
were off by 80
Since he was on a plane that night
he had a better idea of where Copper landed
He told FBI that
they should be searching near the drainage area of the Washougal River
A few months later Toms suspicion was proven right
An 8yearold boy
found some 20 notes lying on the bank of the Columbia River
All of these were 20 bills
and some of them were still in bundles held together with rubber bands
Hijacker DB Cooper
the first break in the only unsolved  airplane hijacking in United States history
came on a Columbia River beach
An 8yearold boy dug up the shreds of
3000 on Sunday!
As soon as the police checked the serial numbers of these notes
it was immediately confirmed that
this was the same money from years ago
that was given to Cooper
Another search was conducted around this place
but they couldnt find all of the money
In total they could find only 5800
And Toms hypothesis
of Cooper landing in this area
was proved correct
Tom had said that Cooper must have  landed somewhere near the Washougal river
And the money found was downstream of the same river
After this the FBI searched the area in the hope of
finding a body or some pieces of the parachute
But they couldnt find anything
FBI agent Richard Tosaw believed that
Cooper must have drowned in the  cold water of the river that night
An interesting fact here was that
the 8yearold boy who found these notes
was given some portions of these notes as a reward
And in 2008 when the boy grew up
he sold 15 notes in an online auction
And in return for these 20 notes
he got 37000
Because Coopers case was so popular all over the world
people were ready to pay such a high amount for these notes
Another big question that arises is that
regardless of what happened to Cooper  after jumping from the plane
who was Cooper actually?

Now lets get back to the topic
We must have some background information
about where this guy came from
and what was his identity
The FBI did not have much to help answer this question
There was a tie and tie clip left behind by Cooper
That tie clip was actually golden
and in that tie clip
they found some specific microscopic particles
In March 2009 a research team
started researching these microscopic particles
using new technology
There was a palaeontologist on this team
a scientific illustrator
and a metallurgist
They used electron microscopy to examine these particles
Some portions of the tieclip were of unalloyed titanium
with traces of aluminium and titanium antimony alloy
Their findings suggested that
Cooper worked in a chemical  or metal manufacturing plant
or in an aeronautical engineering company
Maybe he worked in Boeing itself
Because the unalloyed titanium that was used in the tieclip
back then it was used in aircraft fabrication facilities
The Periodical Table of clue say scientists
suggest that Cooper had access to a manufacturing company
that made airplanes
Like the one he jumped from
Perhaps a company with a connection to Boeing
In the first year of the investigation
FBI talked to the passengers and flight crew
to make a sketch of Coopers face
What did Cooper look like?
The first sketch created by 28th November 1971 looked like this
But Air Hostess Schaffer and many witnesses said that
it was not an accurate representation
It took another year to make a new sketch
This wasnt very accurate either
And on 2nd January 1973
the FBI made their third and final sketch of Cooper
After seeing this new sketch
an air hostess said that this photo was accurate
Looking at this drawing it can be easily said that
Cooper looked like this
Dan Coopers real face
and his possible profession
was revealed to the world
Many people started making new theories
about his identity
About who Cooper was
Larry Carr who had led the  investigative team from 20062009
believed that Cooper was an aircraft cargo loader in the Air Force
Because cargo loaders were given basic jump training
How to wear parachutes
how to deploy parachutes
And even on the working of the plane
how to deploy the stairs in the plane
they know all this
Based on these descriptions
the FBI released a list of more than 800 suspects
800 people
any of them could be DB Cooper
But 20 of them were seriously considered
23 of them have interesting stories
One of them was Richard McCoy
an army veteran of the Vietnam War
5 months after the Coopers hijack
he hijacked a plane
in a manner eerily similar to Coopers
A Boeing 727 plane
he demanded 4 parachutes and 500000
The young man wanted 500000
and requested 4 parachutes
After taking the money he deployed the rear stairs
and jumped
But the only difference was that
just two days after the hijack
the FBI found him and arrested him
He was sentenced to 45 years in jail
and the FBI thought that he was Cooper
And that this was his second attempt at hijacking
He was arrested here in his home in Provo Utah
early this morning
When the FBI men came
he did not resist
In 1991 a book was published
DB Cooper The Real McCoy
Written by former FBI agent Russell Caleme
This book states that when McCoys family
was shown the tie and tie clip belonging to Cooper
they believed that those were McCoys
But when McCoy was asked
if he was DB Cooper
he refused to admit or deny it
After spending 2 years in jail
McCoy attempted a jailbreak
which led to a shootout
in which he was killed
After hearing all this you may feel that
the mystery is solved
But there are more twists in our story
Today the FBI does not officially consider McCoy as DB Cooper
There are 2 major reasons behind this
First based on the sketch they made
the description of DB Cooper does not match McCoy
Second the FBI later found evidence
of McCoys whereabouts during the night of Coopers hijacking
He was in Las Vegas
The next day he was at his home with his family
Since there is evidence of this
it is clear that
McCoy cannot be DB Cooper
The second suspect was
a Vietnam War veteran named Robert Rackstraw
He was arrested multiple times for fraud
aircraft theft and possession of explosives
But he was always found not guilty after the arrest
TV producer Thomas Colbert wrote a book in 2016
The Last Master Outlaw
To prove that Rackstraw was DB Cooper
He made a documentary on History Channel
DB Cooper Case Closed
where he said the same thing
Colbert worked with a team of 40 people
including many former FBI agents
All of them believed that Rackstraw was the real DB Cooper
What is the evidence for this?
When FBI began the investigation in the 1970s
Rackstraw was high on the list of initial suspects
In those days Rackstraw used to give joke comments to the media
on the possibility that he was the hijacker
However many years later
he denied these claims
His face matched the sketches
But the FBI let him go after 1979
and removed him from the suspect list
because they couldnt get substantial evidence
TV producer Colbert believed that
the FBI should have kept investigating this guy
With more FBI investigation
they could have uncovered the evidence
While on 11th July 2016
Colbert launched his new book on DB Cooper
the next day on 12th July 2016
the FBI closed the case
In 2016 Rackstraw was 73 years old
and because of the allegations against him in this book
he lost his job
Later in 2019
he passed away due to natural causes
So friends we are back at the same point
Even today this mystery of DB Cooper
is an unsolved mystery
No one knows who was DB Cooper
where did he come from
and where did he go
Now that you know about this mystery what do you think?
That night when DB Cooper jumped off the plane
could Cooper survive that jump or not?
Write in the comments below
It is quite surprising that
after Coopers hijacking
there were many similar hijackings
But in all those hijackings
the hijackers who used parachutes to jump off the plane
first of all he always survived
And second he was always caught by the police or FBI
But what about Cooper?
