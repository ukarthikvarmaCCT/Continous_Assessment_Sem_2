Hello friends!
Picture yourself on a ship at sea
relishing the fresh and invigorating sea breeze
Suddenly a remarkable sight unfolds before you
a colossal missile emerges from the water
Not just any missile
but a nuclear missile
with the capability to reach a target  on the other side of the globe
spanning thousands of kilometers
This isnt a mere imagination
its a reality today thanks to submarines
The footage you just witnessed
was a test of a Trident 2 missile  conducted by the US Navy
launched from a US Ohioclass submarine
The Trident 2 falls under the category of
submarinelaunched ballistic missiles SLBMs
representing one of the most formidable weapons globally
These SLBMs boast an estimated yield of 475 kilotons
a stark contrast to the 1213 kiloton yield of  the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima
Presently these potent weapons
are housed within submarines
stealthily traversing the worlds oceans
in highly classified undisclosed locations
In todays video lets delve into  the intricacies of these submarines
understanding the technology that propels them
and unravelling their operational mechanisms
Fundamentally all submarines operate based on
Archimedes principle
a concept likely familiar from school
As an object sinks
it experiences a buoyant force
equivalent to the weight of the fluid displaced
due to this objects sinking
When a submarines weight  matches that of the water it displaces
it achieves a level of neutral buoyancy
Allowing it to maintain a constant depth
When the objective is to submerge
the gravitational force applied must exceed
the buoyant force
prompting the use of ballast tanks
Typically these two tanks are located at the submarines ends
they are filled with air at the surface
enabling the vessel to float
To descend into the water
these ballast tanks are flooded with water
increasing the submarines weight
and initiating the descent
Such scenarios are labelled to have negative buoyancy
It indicates the control of a submarines depth
by adjusting the water level in its ballast tanks
This mechanism governs vertical  movement for ascending and descending
For lateral movement  such as turning sideways in the water
a Rudder is employed
It looks like this
It is known as a Vertical Rudder
This facilitates horizontal movement in the water
Similar rudders are used in boats ships and aircraft
Additionally forward and backward motion  is achieved through the use of a propeller
essentially a fan
While navigating underwater
a reliable means of orientation is essential
Sonar technology serves this purpose
It operates based on sound
There are two main types of sonar technologies
active sonar and passive sonar
Active sonar involves emitting sound from the submarine
The sound travels through the water
collides with objects and upon  reflection back to the submarine
the time and distance calculations
provide information about the submarines  location and the surrounding environment
In contrast passive sonar does not emit sound
but rather detects sounds from other  sources such as enemy submarines
by listening to their engine and propeller noises
to determine their distance
However the use of sonar technology  has adverse effects on marine life
impacting creatures like whales and dolphins
which also rely on sonar for communication
To address this concern some submarines  are exploring alternative technologies
such as LiDAR
Light Detection and Ranging
LiDAR employs light to estimate distance
and is already integrated into many modern smartphones
Another alternative is using RADAR
Radio Detection and Ranging
it is effective above water and in aircrafts
which utilizes radio waves to calculate distances
but is limited underwater due to the  restricted transmission of radio waves
Lastly emerging technologies are being  explored as potential alternatives like
MRS  Magnetic Anomaly Detection System
or Gravitational Anomaly Detection System
However the bottom line is that today
the predominant technology employed  in submarines is Sonar
Multiple Sonar sensors are strategically  installed around submarines
to continuously collect and monitor data
ensuring there are no obstacles or hazards in their path
This underscores the vital role of data science
whether in space on ground or underwater
it is a necessity in almost every domain
Unsurprisingly data science has emerged  as one of the most lucrative career options

Now lets delve into the inner workings of a submarine
Typically an armed military submarine  consists of three levels or decks
This video will mostly focus on military submarines
as they constitute the majority of submarines worldwide
Its worth noting that the designs of  research and tourism submarines may differ
For instance the Titan submersible gained attention a few months ago
due to its accident
and Ive covered it in a separate video if youre interested in learning more
If youre interested you can check out the  detailed video

Now turning our attention to military submarines
The topmost deck of a military submarine  is typically outfitted with torpedoes
which serve as weapons
The lowest deck houses battery rooms
that supply electricity to the submarine
and sandwiched in between are the diesel machine
motor room and the nerve center  known as the control room
Positioned above the control room  youll usually find a conning tower
an essential component serving as  the submarines attack center
The conning tower is equipped with various instruments
including periscopes for observing the surroundings
electronic antennas and access points for arms
It also serves as the main entry and exit point
for individuals entering or leaving the submarine
Torpedoes are stored in torpedo tubes
These are basically selfpropelled underwater missiles
These tubes are cylindrical containers  designed to house these cylindrical missiles
In modern submarines torpedoes  are typically placed at the front
However in the 2017 Bollywood film Ghazi Attack
the depiction of a submarine featured  torpedoes at both the front and back
This was historically accurate as powerful submarines back then
indeed had torpedoes at both ends
because torpedoes could only travel  in a straight line at the time
An intriguing aspect is that
these torpedo tubes can also be used as  emergency escape routes from submarines
Nevertheless escaping through them is no easy feat
The tubes have a narrow diameter  measuring only 1275 inches for light torpedoes
and 21 inches for heavy torpedoes
First of all this is an extremely narrow space
Additionally individuals attempting to escape  must wear a 23 kg escape
suit due to the immense water pressure at those depths
One cant simply exit the submarine at those depths
The immense pressure of the water  would crush the unprepared instantly
Officers working in submarines
undergo rigorous training for six months
Indias sole military submarine training establishment
INS Satavahana  is located in Vishakhapatnam city
At this training facility numerous replicas  of torpedo tubes are available
for officers to practice emergency escapes
Now lets delve into the submarines power source
where does it get the energy to operate?
The answer depends on the type of submarine
with two primary categories in India
conventional submarines and nuclear submarines
Conventional submarines utilize large electrical batteries
akin to car batteries but these  require recharging every 23 days
To recharge these batteries
a diesel engine is needed
However operating a diesel engine
necessitates oxygen from the air
Since submarines operate underwater
they must resurface to run the  diesel engine and recharge the batteries
In contrast nuclear submarines dont have this problem
They employ a nuclear reactor instead  of a diesel engine to generate electricity
This allows them to remain submerged for extended periods
limited only by the human factors
such as the availability of food  and provisions for the crew
The submarines can remained submerged  as long as theres sufficient provisions for the crew
Examining the structure of a submarine
the outer layer is typically composed of rubber
This reason for strategic choice is quite simple actually
Because rubber effectively absorbs sound
making it challenging to detect submarines in the water
Military submarines are designed to be elusive
ensuring they are not easily spotted by enemy counterparts
The black layer visible in submarine photos
is made of rubber
Moving to the interior the primary body  of the submarine within the rubber layer
is referred to as the Hull
There are two common types of hulls
single hull and double hull
Single hull submarines have only one layer of the main body
while double hull submarines consist of two layers of the main body
In the double hull design
the ballast tank is integrated
with water filling the space between the two layers
effectively serving as a ballast tank
The clear advantage of a double hull configuration
lies in providing an additional layer of protection
In the event of a collision
a double hull submarine offers enhanced security
Most modern military submarines
adopt the double hull design
not only for added protection  but also to better withstand water pressure
as illustrated by the incident involving the Titan submersibles
implosion under water pressure
At the waters surface the atmospheric pressure is 1 atmosphere
equivalent to 1 kilogram per square centimeter
As one descends underwater pressure increases
For every 10 meters of depth
theres an additional 1 kilogram per square meter of pressure
Military submarines are typically designed  to operate at depths of 300400 meters
with some capable of reaching depths of 500 meters
At this depth the pressure reaches 50 atmospheres
50 times greater than at the surface
Obviously constructing submarine  hulls requires robust materials
Not using the right materials
might cause failures or accidents
As with the Titan submersible
Military submarines use highquality steel alloys
blending steel with titanium carbon  aluminium and other elements
The complexity of designing a submarine is underscored
by the fact that it takes approximately  10 years to design a dieselelectric submarine
while a nuclear submarine demands a  minimum of 1517 years at the designing stage
This intricacy is why India often outsources submarine design
to other countries such as Russia Germany or France
However India manufactures its own submarines
Indias first domestically manufactured  submarine was INS Shalki
launched in 1987 during  Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhis tenure
and commissioned by the Indian Navy in 1992
On Indian Navys website you will see that
there are different categories of submarines
which are divided into classes
In India there are four classes
Sindhughosh Shishumar Kalvari and Arihant
The first three classes
are of conventional submarines
the Sindhughosh class comprises Russian dieselpowered EKMs
the Shishumar class features German SSKs
and the Kalvari class showcases new Frenchdesigned and Indianbuilt SCORPENEs
Here EKMs SSKs and SCORPENEs
are the nomenclature used for submarines in other countries
But we classify these submarines into these classes
These classes of submarines
can be compared to the models of cars
Specifically Sindhughosh comprises 7 submarines
Shishumar has 4
and the Kalvari class has 5 operational submarines
Detailed information about each submarine  including names can be found on the Indian Navy website
and the link is provided in the description below
Moving to the category of nuclear submarines
India has named its class Arihant
Currently there are two active nuclear submarines in this class
with two more under construction in Vishakhapatnam
The Arihantclass submarines have the  capability to carry ballistic missiles
Ballistic missiles are selfguided missiles
that can be equipped with nuclear bombs
INS Arihant is presently armed with  K15 submarinelaunched ballistic missile
an SLBM like the one I mentioned earlier in the video
The range of the K15 missile is  between 750 km and 1900 km
Talking about the other developed countries
the American Navys Ohioclass submarines
are considered among the most powerful in the world
The US possesses a total of 18 Ohioclass submarines
each capable of carrying 24 Trident 2 ballistic missiles
Furthermore each Trident 2 missile can  potentially accommodate 14 nuclear bombs
When the United States and Russia
aimed to decrease the number of nuclear weapons they had
they entered into the START 1 agreement
The terms of the agreement specified  a reduction limit from 14 to 8
This START I treaty officially known  as the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
was the first treaty between the US and the Soviet Union
to reduce strategic nuclear weapons
Beyond these the US Navy features other submarine classes
such as Los Angeles Columbia and Virginia classes
In Russia the Yasen class stands out as the  most powerful nuclear attack submarine
Besides India Russia and the US other countries like
China the UK France and Germany  also possess similar submarines
The actual capacity of these submarines in terms of personnel
varies between submarines
and the actual data is confidential in these countries
due to military reasons
The estimated capacity of a submarine  generally ranges between 50 and 80 people
50 to 80 people can be onboard these submaries
With nuclear submarines being even larger
it can accommodate approximately 100 individuals
The size of these submarines is truly  remarkable as depicted in the video
Its unbelievable
For those eager to witness these marvels in person
a visit to Vishakhapatnam home to a  submarine museum is recommended
The museum features INS Kursura  a retired Indian Navy submarine
commissioned in 1969
Notably the museum was inaugurated in 2002
by the then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh
Mr Chandra Babu Naidu
If you desire the firsthand experience  of being inside a submarine
tourism submarines or research  submarines offer such opportunities
Typically nonmilitary submarines do not  venture too deep into the water
The Titan submersible was an exception
Such deepsea submarines are  rare in the tourism sector
A few companies in Europe the USA and the UK
provide submarine and submersible dives
Such as the companies Atlantis and Seabourn
They offer expeditions to locations like Alaska
