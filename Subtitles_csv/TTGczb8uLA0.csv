Hello friends!
20th July 1969
The Lunar Module of the Apollo 11 mission landed on the moon
Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were in it
After the landing Neil Armstrong tried to open the door
to get down on the moon
It wasnt easy opening this door
due to high pressure
but he successfully opened it after a little struggle
Then he tried to get down to the moon in his heavy spacesuit
The exit wasnt spacious
so by mistake he hit the top and a piece of the Lunar Module broke off
Neither of them was aware of this
because of the lack of air
The sound didnt travel
They didnt hear any sound
But this broken piece was very crucial
It was the Assent Engine Arming Switch
Without this switch their Lunar Module couldnt take off again
and they couldnt return to Earth
Unaware of this Neil Armstrong got out
and stepped on the moons surface
He became the first man to step on the moon
One small step for man
one giant leap for mankind
But did it actually happen?
Today more than 50 years later
many people refuse to believe that humans had gone to the moon
People cook up theories of their own
to claim that the entire Apollo 11 mission was a farce put up by America
That they filmed the scenes on Earth
and lied to the world
How else do you explain the flag fluttering without air?
Whats the truth to it?
Come lets try to understand this story
in todays video
All engines running
We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do other things
not because they are easy but because they are hard
Tranquillity Base here
The Eagle has landed!
One small step for man
one giant leap for mankind
Friends youd be surprised to know
the real reason why Apollo 11 mission was planned
was a war
Specifically speaking the Cold War
Fought between America and the Soviet Union
Both countries were engaged in a Space Race
In 1957 the Soviet Union became the first country
to launch the first artificial satellite
It was named Sputnik  and it was the first manmade object
to be placed in Earths orbit
The American government was shocked to see the Soviets getting ahead
Months later in 1958 America launched their satellite as well
But 3 years later in 1961
America got another shock
Soviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin
was the first person to go to space
The Soviets beat America once again
One week later the then President of America
John F Kennedy
wrote a letter to the Vice President
dated 20th April 1961
He asked the Vice President how they could beat the Soviet Union
by putting a laboratory in space
or by a trip around the moon
Are we working 24 hours a day on existing programs?
If not why not?
Are we making the maximum effort?
Asking if there was another space program that could be achieved quickly
that would produce dramatic results and give them a lead in the race
He got the answer some days later
because he soon realised that
the next big step would be to send humans to the moon
On 25th May 1961
in his famous speech he promised the world
that he would send humans to the moon before the end of the decade
Not only this he also promised to
get the humans back on Earth safely
Before this decade is out
of landing a man on the moon
and returning him safely to the Earth
For many this was an unbelievable announcement
Friends imagine 1961
There were no smartphones no internet
there wasnt even GPS technology
The computers were so slow and old
in such times he was promising
to send humans to the moon
For this over the next 5 years
he provided 79 billion in additional funding to the space program
The entire space agency was engaged in fulfilling this one aim
Mere months later the tests began
First they tested the rockets
that would be used to leave the Earth
Then the heat shields of the command modules were tested
How much theyd be able to resist heat
Then the propulsion system of the service module
Between 1963 to 1967
many unmanned tests were carried out
The rockets didnt carry any humans
during the tests
In February 1967
the planned the first manned tests
A test in which astronauts will go up to space in the rockets
This was the Apollo 1 mission
But during the tests on Earth
on 27th January 1967
the cabin caught on fire
and the three astronauts preparing to go to space
died in the fire
After this painful event NASA didnt lose courage
Instead it continued further testing
Apollo 4 Apollo 5 and Apollo 6
were all unmanned missions
for further testing
In October 1968 Apollo 7 mission was launched
and once again they attempted to
send humans to space
This was successful
Only 2 months later in December 1968
Apollo 8 mission was launched
in which three astronauts were sent near the moon
Three months later in March 1969
Apollo 9 mission was launched
In this the lunar module was tested
The part of the spacecraft that was actually going to land on the moon
And 2 months after that in May 1969
was the Apollo 10 mission
In this mission 3 astronauts
had to do almost everything for practice
that was supposed to be done in Apollo 11 mission
except actually landing on the moon
Look at the speed with which NASA
was launching the missions one after the other
In the gap of 2 to 3 months
a new mission to test the next thing
Testing the rockets spacecraft
going to the moon
and after all these tests
finally on 16th July 1969
Apollo 11 mission was launched
All engine running
Liftoff we have a liftoff
32 minutes past the hour
Liftoff of Apollo 11
Three astronauts were a part of this mission
38yearold commander Neil Armstrong
he led this mission
The pilot of the Command Module Michael Collins
And the pilot of the Lunar Module Edwin Buzz Aldrin
These three names are inscribed in the pages of history
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin become famous names
everyone knows them today
But Michael Collins isnt very popular
the reason for this is very interesting Ill tell you later in this video
The spacecraft of this Apollo 11 mission
had three main parts
The Command Module Service Module and the Lunar Module
The first two are collectively known as CSM
Command and Service Module
They aimed to detach the Lunar Module and have it land on the moon
And to return the Lunar Module would have to be
relaunched and attached to the CSM
to enable the astronauts to return to Earth
To launch this spacecraft a Saturn V5 rocket was to be used
Before the launch the rocket was loaded with
1 million gallon of Kerosene Liquid Oxygen and Liquid Hydrogen
The weight of this rocket was 3 million kg
With its help the spacecraft reached Earths orbit
It took less than 10 minutes to reach the orbit
Then they made about 15 revolutions around the Earth
after which they were given the permission from the mission control
the mission control was of course based on Earth
they communicated their permission to begin TransLunar Injection
ie taking the spacecraft out of Earths orbit and towards Moons orbit
To leave Earths orbit the Saturn V5 rocket was used
This was the third stage for the rocket
These events took place within 5 hours of the launch
But to actually reach the moon took several days
Astronauts waited in the spacecraft
the ate slept and took pictures of themselves and their surroundings
19th July 1969
After travelling for almost 400000 km
The Apollo 11 spacecraft reached moons orbit
Here it was supposed to be split into 2
The Command and Service Module separated from the Lunar Module
Michael Collins was in the Command Module
This part of the spacecraft was nicknamed Columbia
And the Lunar Module was nicknamed the Eagle
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were in it
The thing is that the command and service module
was tasked to remain in the moons orbit
Only the lunar module was going to land on the moon
It meant that only Armstrong and Aldrin had the chance to step on the moon
and not Michael Collins
Perhaps this is the reason why not many people know Michael Collins
Even though he was a part of the Apollo mission
he did not step on the moon
But even so Michael Collins part in this mission
was perhaps the most important
Because the Lunar Module was supposed to be reattached to the CSM
Without Michael Collins
Armstrong and Aldrin could not have returned safely
Around 8 PM the Lunar Module was going to land on the moon
Exactly at 810 PM
alarms went off
1201 and 1202 alarms
1201 1201
Roger 1201 alarm
Neither Armstrong nor Aldrin knew
the meaning of this alarm
They asked the mission control what they ought to do next
Mission control tells them to ignore it and keep going
Were GO Same type Were GO
Later they figured out that 1202 was a warning
The processing system of the guidance computer of the Apollo was overloaded
But thankfully the computer was designed in a way that
the essential programs which were critical for the mission
would continue despite being overloaded
The computer was installed with the program for automatic landing
This would automatically land the Lunar Module on Moons surface
But at the height of 150 metres
Neil Armstrong took over the control
He noticed that the Lunar Module was going to land at a place where
huge boulders were strewn about
The landing spot was changed then
And they decided on another spot 4 miles from the predetermined landing spot
for the actual landing
At 816 PM
Buzz Aldrin checked the fuel indicator
Only 5 fuel remained
100 feet 312 down 9 forward
5 per cent
Seeing the low level of fuel the mission control initiated a countdown
The countdown to decide whether they should land or abort the mission
Now were at critical fuel state
And thats why the 60second call is given
And then the 30second call
Finally literally at the last minute
with only 30 seconds remaining in this countdown
Neil Armstrong sent a radio message to Earth
Roger Tranquility
The Eagle had successfully landed
Then Neil Armstrong put on his spacesuit opened the door
and stepped on the moon
This moment was watched by 650 million people on television
His first words were televised to the world
Buzz Aldrin followed him on the moons surface
and for the next 25 hours
they collected samples of the moons dust and rocks
took photographs
set up several scientific instruments as well
Although it is true that the Cold War was a big reason for this moon landing
but because the moon landing was already planned
it was such a huge achievement so obviously
they were carrying scientific instruments with them
There were several scientific objectives of this mission as well
They set up a television camera on the moon
to transmit signals to the Earth
They took a device with them to measure the solar winds reaching the moon
They installed a device to send laser beams to the Earth
So that the laser beams could be used
to compute the exact distance between Earth and Moon
They also had a passive seismometer
To measure the earthquakes on the moon
Of course theyre called Moonquakes
They collected 23 kg of rock and dust from the moon
And they left behind an American flag
And a plate with the inscription
Here Men from the Planet Earth
First set foot upon the Moon
July 1969 AD
The Lunar Module had to remain on the moon for 21 hours
After this it had to take off once again
and attach to the CSM
But to go up they needed propulsion
And for that they needed an engine
Both Armstrong and Aldrin were unaware that
the switch to turn on the engine
had broken off while they were getting out
I told you this at the beginning of the video
When they came back to the Lunar Module
they realised what had happened
They informed the mission control about this damage
and look for a solution to resolve the situation
They come up with an interesting solution to the problem
Now what exactly is a switch?
Switch basically works to complete an electrical circuit
Buzz Aldrin realised that if the circuit is broken
They looked for something that could be used
to complete the circuit once again
When he looked around he noticed his ballpoint pen
He used that ballpoint pen to complete the circuit
and to reignite the engine
Finally the Lunar Module was reattached to the CSM
and the three astronauts turn the spacecraft towards Earth
The plan for landing on Earth was that
The Command Module and the Service Module would be separated
The service module would then be destroyed due to Earths atmosphere
But there was a danger that if the service module was damaged severely
with its debris floating all around
they may hit the command module
killing the astronauts on board
To avoid this NASA installed thrusters in the Service Module
To take it far from the Command Module
So that they do not collide with each other
But when the astronauts were returning to Earth
they found out that the thrusters on the Service Module werent working
The three astronauts could only sit in the Command Module
and watch the service module break apart around them
Its debris was floating all around them
It was a miracle that the broken pieces
did not hit the command module
And the command module remains safe
The risk of the astronauts dying on this mission was so high that
the US President Nixon had prepared an alternate speech
in case the astronauts were indeed killed
Can you imagine an alternate speech?
In it he had written
Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace
will stay on the moon to rest in peace
These brave men Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin
know that there is no hope for their recovery
These two men are laying down their lives
in mankinds most noble goal
The search for truth and understanding
But thankfully this wasnt needed
The Command Module safely descended the Earths atmosphere
The parachutes were deployed and it landed in the ocean
All three astronauts were alive and safe
These astronauts were then evacuated by rescue ships from the ocean
It was truly a miracle that they could return alive
It wasnt that the mission had gone exactly as it was planned
They had to face problems at almost every step
They successfully dealt with the problems
and they could return alive
It is interesting to note that
after returning the three astronauts were quarantined for 2 weeks
They werent allowed to be in contact with other humans
Because of the risk of them carrying pathogens
Viruses or bacteria that they might have encountered on moon
that could possibly wreck havoc on Earth
No one knew for sure
But again thankfully nothing of the sort happened
Apollo 11s moon landing was the top news in newspapers worldwide
The US President Kennedys promise
of having humans land on the moon before the end of the decade
was made possible by NASA
In 1969 the public had little reason to question
mankinds historic first step on the moon
After all the achievement was a celebration of
technological supremacy
America had finally won the Space Race
Isnt it very suspicious
that the decade that was about to end in 1970
a year before that in 1969 America had reached the moon?
It cant be that to have an advantage in the Cold War
America planned a fake moon landing operation can it?
That their actual moon landing mission failed
and they planned this fake mission as backup
for the world to see
Friends this is just one example of the many conspiracy theories
that is based on the moon landing
But friends the truth is that these conspiracy theories
have already been debunked several times
If this was a fake attempt by America to fool the world
the Soviets would never have acknowledged it
But in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia published between 19701979
in its Third Edition
this moon landing was said to be factual multiple times
Soviet articles have even been written
that the Apollo landing was the third historic event of the space age
First was Sputniks launch in 1957
Second Yuri Gagarins flight in 1961
And the third was the moon landing
The Soviet Union had actually acknowledged this
But then what about the flag?
The flag which was planted on the moon
why was it fluttering?
There is no air on the moon
There is a simple reason for that friends
The flag that Armstrong and Aldrin had taken to the moon
was a specially designed flag
Normal flags have one long vertical rod
But there was a horizontal rod in this too
Right at the top of the flag
So that the flag would always be extended out
Because everyone working at NASA knew that
if a flag is planted on the moon
it wouldnt flutter due to the lack of wind
So they decided to add a horizontal rod at the top
so that the flag could always be properly visible
But on this Apollo 11 mission
there were some problems extending this horizontal rod
So this couldnt be extended till the end
Which caused the ripple that we see
There were waves in the flag
Thats why people think that the flag is fluttering
But actually the flag isnt fluttering
You can see the flag fluttering only in the videos where
the astronauts are holding it and making it move
The reason for this is that
the aluminium rods in the flag
were acting as springs
So the flag would move for a little while and then remain still
The third most popular theory is that
in the photos taken by Armstrong and Aldrin
stars arent visible
The answer to this is very simple
The moon landing took place in the day
At a time when the sunlight was hitting the moon
And the white spacesuits that were worn by the astronauts
were very reflective too
The cameras back then didnt have such resolution to see beyond reflections
Even today take any phones camera
and try to take a pic at night
if the flash is turned on
you wont see the stars in the background
Another theory is about the shadows
About the inconsistency in the angles of the shadows
People argue that since this was like a Hollywood film
They didnt have just a single source of light
Thats why the shadows are going all over the place
But in reality the Sun was not the only source of light
The moons surface was also acting as a complementary source of light
because it was reflecting so much light
This is why the light scattered in all directions
and the shadows were so bizarre
Another question is raised about Buzz Aldrins photo taken by Neil Armstrong
It shows Armstrongs reflection
but you can see a camera in his hand
How could this happen?
Its because he wasnt holding the camera in his hand
instead the camera was mounted on his suit
And he could control it from there
But then who took the photos of Neil Armstrong descending from the Lunar Module?
Again a simple answer
multiple cameras were installed on the Lunar Module
But moving beyond these mindless theories
if we talk about actual criticism
Friends not everyone was applauding the moon landing
commending NASAs work
many people strongly criticised NASA
and the American government after the moon landing
People were already criticising it before the moon landing
In January 1962 the New York Times published an article
in which they revealed that the money being spent to go on the moon
could have been used to build at least 120 Harvardsized universities
They questioned whether so much money should be spent to go to the moon
or should they open a Harvardsized university in every US state?
Werent there better ways to spend that money?
Basically the main point of criticism was that
there were so many problems in the country
education income inequality
back then America was also facing the consequences of the Vietnam War
So why was so much money wasted on this?
But in reality there were many hidden benefits of the moon landing
that no one had even thought about
Such as the advancements in computer chips
In 1962 it had been 3 years since microchips were invented
And IBM had decided that in the early 1960s
they wouldnt use these chips in their computers
It has the packaged integrated circuit
Inside this package is a chip of silicon
which provides the electrical equivalent
of many transistors resistors and diodes
all interconnected to provide the desired function
But since NASA put in so many orders to buy integrated circuits
IBM started working on it
and because of the heavy demand
its price fell by more than 90 over the next 5 years
And so NASA tested whether we can rely on computers
for the safety of human lives
If astronauts could go to the moon and back
by relying on these computer chips
we can obviously rely on these computer chips for our daily lives
The technology grew exponentially after this moon landing
Even so only 3 years after the Apollo 11 mission
in December 1972
the last moon mission Apollo 17 took place
Since then friends
It has been almost 50 years
no other person went to the moon during these 50 years
Perhaps this is the biggest proof
about how expensive the Apollo program was
More than 400000 engineers scientists and technicians had worked on it
and the total cost back then was 24 billion
In todays money the cost is more than 100 billion
Initially it was criticised by journalists only
But by 1972
the average persons fascination with NASA
and the moon had ended
As the Vietnam War continued
the problems of the citizens were on the rise
Thousands of demonstrators opposed to the Vietnam War
assemble in the nations capital for a mass protest
They saw the space program as a waste of money
Even though NASA had plans for missions up to Apollo 20
politicians had to heed the citizens
and the money being spent on space programs
had to be cut down
In December 2017 former President Donald Trump said that
he would increase the funding
so that humans could be sent back to the moon by 2024
returning American astronauts to the moon
for the first time since 1972
for longterm exploration and use this time
But later he changed his statement and said that
NASA should focus on Mars rather than on the moon
But 50 years later now NASA has made plans again
to send people to the moon
Their new Artemis program
They would begin testing with unmanned rockets
but NASA plans that by 20252026
they would send the first woman to the moon
After which they plan to send the first person of colour to the moon as well
One thing can be said for sure
Before the end of this decade
we will see humans back on the moon
