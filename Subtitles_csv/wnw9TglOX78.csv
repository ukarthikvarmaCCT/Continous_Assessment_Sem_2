Welcome everybody to Chai pe Charch Chai with Sai
Where I will be giving my heavily biased opinions on mildly interesting topics
So our first topic of the day is Amit Bhadanas new music video Parichay
Amit Bhadana is the biggest Indian Youtuber with over 13M subscribers
Now Im not going to forcefully roast Amit Bhadana just for the sake of it
The music was good and the production quality was amazing
Its one of the most wellproduced videos in Indian Youtube
But the lyrics were a bit repetitive
Who gives an introduction for 7 minutes? It doesnt take 7 minutes for an introduction
This is not a roast this is more like a Saute Im just going to share my opinions
The most interesting visual I found in the music video was when a hater is holding a phone and seeing a photo of Amit Bhadana hospitalised and laughing on it
So he is trying to show that his haters make fun of him being hospitalised
Thats not true Your haters make fun of you because of your content
Please dont be so arrogant But the music video was good
And just in case you dint realise that Amit Bhadana has worked hard he makes sure you know that
I have worked hard
Wow nice everyone should work hard
I have worked hard
I got the point you have worked hard No doubt
I have worked hard
Okay I got that you worked hard everyone works hard What is your point?
I have worked hard
To hell with your Parichay
On this music video CarryMinatis response was this
Yes Amit Bhadanas Parichay song is great He has worked hard
And BB ki Vines said this Very good He has worked hard
This is just my personal opinion Im not saying that this is the truth
Looking at this reaction it feels that this is the kind of reaction you give when you dont like something but you still give a diplomatic compliment so that the person asking it doesnt feel bad
You have worked hard nobodys denying that
But even Amir Khan worked very hard to make Thugs of Hindustan
This video has the humble brag feels throughout Jake Paul will be proud
Its a really good music video I will not roast just for the sake of roasting
But it was a bit narcissistic I wont deny that
More than an introduction it was more like a CV that Amit Bhadana made for Bollywood
Because few weeks ago he uploaded a 40 min long sketch
Looking at that it seems like he is telling Bollywood that see I can make films as well as songs
I sincerely hope that Amit Bhadana makes it into Bollywood
But it will be a very sad day for the Indian Youtube if that happens Indian comedy Youtube scene will die
I made children and parents laugh I made family friendly content
Also credit where it is due in Amit Bhadanas recent videos he has reduced the amount of misogynistic content So I will apprecitate that
Maybe he saw my roast video maybe not but that doesnt matter
What matters is that he is improving
But nobody can deny Amit Bhadanas success You can question his content but you cant deny his smartness
That music video got 1M Likes in just one day
Congratulations to Amit Bhadana lets move on to our next topic
I always forget to announce this
I have made a subreddit of mine rSaimanSays
So please submit memes funny videos and other mildly interesting stuff so that I dont have to struggle to find content
Our next topic everybody Technical Guruji exposed
Now I respect Tehcnical Guruji a lot because he uploads 2 videos a day
And he is doing that since the past 23 years
But a Youtuber called TechStar Shahrukh has exposed Technical Guruj saying that he is biased
Technical Guruji is the leading Hindi technology channel and he uploaded a video where he did a bend test of the phone Redmi Note 7
So the things about a bend test is that you have to apply pressure to the center of the phone to test the durability of the phone
What Technical Guruji did is that he applied pressure to the edge of the phone
This phone is breaking into 2 pieces This is not a strong device
The funny thing about this is that he applied so much pressure that the bench shakes
Youtuber TechStar Shahrukh says that Tehcnical Guruji did this bend test and broke the phone as a revenge to Xiaomis MDs tweet
People are saying that this tweet by Manu Kumar Jain who is the MD of Xiaomi was indirectly targeted to Technical Guruji
And Technical Guruji did not like this and that is why he did such an extreme bend test om Redmi Note 7 which is owned by Xiaomi
TG is saying that the reason why he did such a harsh bend test on this phone is because this phone claimed that is is that tough
If any Youtuber does this test bend test there is a simple answer for that and thats a publicity stunt
Breaking a phone is easy anyone can do that
Not necessary that if the phone is strong you cant break it A man has a alot of strength
If you have decided to show that the phone breaks in the video you can do it
You can make this video and then this video can go viral
A lot of people are saying that technical guruji has sold out and he is biased towards Samsung
If Technical Gurujis channel gets shut down then who will say Chaliye Shuru Karte Hai??? Lets Start
Then we will have to Chaliye band karte hai Lets stop Im not ready for that
Please TG I hope you have a good explanation Im rooting for you
This tea gets cold very quickly in winter
So our next topic is Pewdiepie vs Tseries Wow it feels like December again I havent spoken about this topic since a long time
SuperBowl is one of the biggest sporting events in the world and definitely Americas biggest sporting event
And there was a lot of hype that Mr Beast is going to advertise Pewdiepie on that show
The SuperBowl show happened yesterday and MrBeast somehow promoted Pewdiepie but people were underwhelmed
Mr Beast and his team went to SuperBowl and they wore TShirts saying Subscribe to Pewdiepie That was funny but
A lot of people thought that Mr Beast was going to buy billboards or a TV commercial during the broadcast
In my opinion it wasnt that bad because ESPN tweeted this picture I dont know who Stephen Gostkowski is
But in the picture you can clearly see Sub To Pewdiepie tshirts in the audience
And im pretty sure that ESPN tweeted this picture just because it had Sub to Pewdiepie in it
So i guess in the end this strategy definitely worked Mr Beast is smart
Also the subgap was 29000 yesterday and most of the Indians were very excited that TSeries is finally going to take over Pewdiepie
But as it always happends the sub gap increased to almost 150000
Mainly because Pewdiepie did a livestream playing Fortnite which he hasnt done before
and also VoiceOverPete and KeemStar did a livestream which might have helped a bit
I think this battle is going to go on forever And Im a proud insiderinfiltrator whatever my post is in the 9 YO army
Also when popular Indian rapper Raftaar was asked who does he support between TSeries vs Pewdiepie
He said that he supports Salil Jamdaar
So Salil Jamdar made a disstrack on Carryminati Pewdiepie and Tseries His diss on Tseries is really damn good
And Raftaar said he supports Salil Jamdar Im happy that a superstar like Raftaar is not being a sheep and supporting Tseries because Patriotism
And of course Amit Bhadana Harsh Beniwal and Ashish Chanchlani have been promoting TSeries on their Social Medias
TSeries is very close to becoming Indias No1 channel and I want everyone to subscribe to them
I have worked with them they are great people TSeries values artists they respect artists
You messages and comments have been telling me that TSeries is going to be the worlds biggest channel
So subscribe to TSeries so that when someone asks which is the highest subscribed channel in the world people will say TSeries
Then people will ask that where is it from people will say India So that will be a proud moment for us
I hope after few years when Youtube is dominated by corporations these individual Indian Youtubers will realise that they are digging their own grave
If you keep supporting companies like this in a few years no one will care about individual creators
Also ending this video with a very wholesome news which happened on reddit
So there is this subreddit called rRoastMe
On that one 17 year old Russian teenager posted this photo
So the concept of this subreddit is that people post their pictures holding a card which says roast me
They get roasted pretty badly but when this guys posted his picture things were different
If you see this photo normally people are very enthusiastic in their photos but this guy looks very sad
Its really very sad but people realised that
