Recently Flying Beast
has filed a defamation legal case of 2 crores against a journalist
What is true and what is not
Will discuss it today
Lets know in this video
The purpose of this video is not to hate anyone
only to put a researched opinion in front of you
And in the end I will leave it to you
what did you understand
and what do you consider to be wrong and right
This video is just for education and awareness which is our mission
and we believe that nothing will be hidden now
All the things
that I am sharing here you will find their public sources
through the link in the video description and you can read them yourself
Flying Beast has announced on his Instagram handle
that he has won a case
Will analyze that case completely
and together with the Havan Controversy
This tweet you are seeing
was tweeted by Flying Beast on its own Twitter handle
and after that there was a lot of trolling
So was Flying Beast right or wrong?
Whether his trolling was right or wrong
we will analyze it
And together we will discuss whats the responsibility of influencers
journalists and brands
Who should be guilty in this whole matter
and who is not lets talk in this video
Lets go
Flying Beast is a person who practices his culture
and talks about it loudly
Someone has a face in their culture
and feel proud about his culture
and Flying Beasts do the same
because their content is family vlogging real life vlogging
which is visible in their vlogs and tweets
When Flying Beast does this Abhishek Bakshi
a socalled journalist
attacks Flying Beast
and says that Abish Mathew who is a huge creator
whose show is visited by big celebrities
big celebrities
big celebrities
How did this bring these people
who do not know
on which fruit their daughters name is
Obviously here Abhishek was right
that there is a difference between raspberry and Rashbhari
It is not that
there is an English meaning and its Hindi meaning is this
Its not like this  Both are different fruits
But would you judge someones credentials by this?
Flying Beast is collaborating with Abish Mathew here
who has 1 million subscribers
and Flying Beast has so many
So who has more advantage here
maybe Abhishek could not understand
Maybe some people who think they are intllectual
and think that they are creative They think that
understanding English is very important
He did not see how many amazing stories Ritu and Gaurav shared
on the naming of their daughter
I guess he missed it
Ritu and I were expecting to download this app
So we downloaded this app
Someone suggested my sister suggested!
So every week  it used to show the progress of baby
Now the baby is of almost puppy size
grown to the size of this
I think during 8 weeks or nine weeks
Now your babys size is of raspberry
Thats she was pleased to know that my baby is like a raspberry
Like a raspberry
And then RashhnhariRashbhari  We started calling her
Which was a very good highlight of this interview of this entire segment
These stories are not PR driven
they are real
Abhishek could not understand this
but his attack continued
and he has made four tweets
He spoke dirty words about Flying Beast
and attacked Brands
He started attacking the livelihood of flying beast
Abhishek If you are not getting the brands yourself
then where is it right to make such attacks on someone elses livelihood?
Is this right or wrong please tell me in the comments
All who are watching this video
before you think that videos is going to be biased
Watch my video which was about Flying Beasts birthday
You will understand that Im not a fan
Im not a fellow creator
whos just trying to say goody things about one of the creator
I feel it was a huge blunder
whether it was wrong or right to arrest I dont know!
But when you have booked an entire metro
and you have so many million followers
even after booking the entire metro you cannot handle them
So it was blunder in a way
Nobody can take that away!
Everything on this channel is unbiased
depending upon whos right and whos wrong
all that particular incident on that particular day
on that particular event
And to analyze this event many things will have to be analyzed
and that is what we are doing
Keep watching!
The fourth tweet of Abhishek in this is very shameful
In this he is telling that the flying beast is mysogynist
Do you understand misogynist?
One who discriminates against another gender
Many more words have come from Misogynist like Patriarchy and many other words
In this he highlights an incident in which Ritu is in labor pain
nd she touches Gauravs feet
He has shown a snapshot
But I would love to show you the full energy of that vlog
Now Ritu is actually in labour
But what she is saying  I didnt touch feet
So Im going to do that
Shes touching feet
I dont know if those educated and intellectual people know
touching feet is not just about
mysogyny and
somebody being superior or inferior
Its about transmitting energies
When a woman is in labor pain she needs energy
So touching her feet means taking energy
I think this is the thing which is in our old culture that people do not know
Thats why people create judgments and assumptions
and attack people in such a way that
why are you collaborating with them
I would like to ask
if a man is practicing his religion
practicing his faith and his culture whats wrong in that?
Could that be a basis whether those brands collaborate with him or not?
Lets go forward
Before we talk about Shephalis article
on whom there is a defamation case of full two crores
Before analyzing that article
I want to talk about the Havan controversy
which is related to this article because this article starts from tweets related to havan
tweets related to havan
Lets talk a little bit about this controversy
I didnt give my take at that time but I want to give now
Its very important
Gaurav tweets on 1st May that there is house warming ceremony in our house
which he writes as planet
which is okay people trolled him on this
which is again
He says that were doing house warming ceremony
Hinduism is a science based way of life
On 3rd Dec 1984
two families remained unaffected from Bhopal gas leak
and fourth is that
Havan which is a natural antidote to polllution
He said these four things
Many people trolled him on this
I would like to say something about this
Let us first talk abou Bhopal gas tragedy
More than 3000 people died in it
More than 500000 people were injured
And after this accident 12000 people died
And we are seeing the after effects of that thing till today
And it was because that gas was too toxic
One of the most toxic gases in the world
Methyl isocyanate
Thats a very dangerous compund
Due to this there is maximum penetration in your lungs
then there can be choking there
And because of this many people also died
lets analyze this tweet a bit
He said Hinduism is a science based of life
I thought religion is a set of believes and practices
For ex just like there are mantras in our Hindu religion
I also chant mantras
because I feel that the structure and combination of some mantras is such that
it produces certain vibrations and sounds
And this sound very much channelizes your state of mind
in the right direction and for which the mantra is
for which that sound is being produced
And if thats the case its a science right?
Because sciencescience is what?
If you observe such things if you chant mantras for 1 hour
and then see how you are feeling
and how is the energy around you
If you observe and see some difference thats a science
Science is all about that
You take a hypothesis and if you collect dataabout it and observe it
that gives you the result
Im okay with Gauravs tweets about this
that Hinduism is a science based of life
Therere many things about Hinduism infact every religion
If you understand it properly
it is very scientific
But people assume as I have already said
Thats the problem
Then the third thing that Gaurav said
is that he told about an incident
He told that the two families were unaffected that day
Infact he was referring to the article which was published in
English Daily in 1985
According to that article there are two families
in which one is Khuswaha family and the other is Prajapati family
Those both families remained unaffected
You read this entire article link is in the description
You can read this complete article and it has complete details
But that article
We cant research on this
Because there are so many things in it that are missing
There may be some other reasons that that family survived
sometimes there are casual relationships too
Now coming to the fourth statement of Flying Beast
He said they performed regular Agnihotra havan
which is a natural antidote to pollution
kind of leading to this thing that
that perhaps they were saved only by performing Agnihotra Havan
which is written in this article
It is not as if Flying Beast himself is telling
If we talk about this thing
whether this is a natural antidote to pollution or not
Many people trolled Flying Beast
Lots of intellectual people and educated people
They were blabbering without doing enough research
and gathering facts
Dhruv Rathi asked which gases are they which compound are they?
Is it sulphur oxide or nitrogen oxide?
Which oxide is that which gets reduced
Akash Banerjee even spoke that it was from WhatsApp University
Abhishek Bakshi came back and said
And replied something similar on the tweet
I would like to say that yes I believe that
Methyl isocyanate gas
is a flammable gas
It interacts when it goes into the atmosphere
It changes its form
And its effect is more on the people living on the ground
because there is more density there
But can you get relief if you are performing Havan somewhere?
I dont know
But guys based on my research
all the intellectual people
all the big creators whore watching this video
I want to share a research with them
It is on Research Gate
I am giving its link for you to read yourself
In that lab research it is clearly written
that when the Havan material that is on your screen
when put in a controlled environment
it was seen that sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide
Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter were reduced by 60
And these different quantities are in front of you
You can check those
And you can read the complete research
Link is in the description
Sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide are reduced by 5060
says that research
by doing havan
If you rubbish any faith any culture it is wrong
And if Gaurav is referring to something and saying
it has happened
should he be trolled?
And should it be accused that he is spreading propaganda?
I think this is wrong
And here comes the responsibility of the journalist
Is this personal hatred or is it their profession?
It is very important to understand this
Now lets talk about this article on which this case has run
on the basis of which Ritu and Gaurav
has filed a defamation case of two crores
Let us analyze what that article says
Shefali refers to the incident of that havan at the very beginning of this article
and says how Gaurav was very insensitive
for all those whose lives were lost people in that tragedy
He did not do research or maybe he was in haste
or was using Abhishek for facts
whose history is telling that
that he has been a hater of a particular ideology
All these tweets tell
If you refer to a person who is associated with the government
vs some creator who is practicing his culture
and who does not differentiate I think this is wrong
But Abhishek was not able to differentiate
He felt that Gaurav is the part of a propaganda machine
and according to me he gave all these facts to Shefali in haste
And the facts which he has given to Shefali
is just a small sample
Lets talk about this article and what was the problem in it
Shephali says that Gaurav does child abuse
And the incident that she has highlighted imagine what it could be
It is that they are piercing in her ears
The girl is saying that do not do vlogging
then he is telling her why not
This is child abuse
She drops a phone from a very high building
and her mother is scolding her
so it is child abuse
Shefali says that she has told all this by a child psychologist
Joy Santosh which I could not find anywhere
But I would like to ask whether it is child abuse or not
How can you tell from this reference?
You are targeting all the brands that work with Flying Beast and Ritu Rathee
based on your own assumptions and prejudice
And it is clear that you do less research
What is child abuse and what is not
I want to understand that
you are saying all this on the basis of Joy Santosh
which I am not getting anywhere
You are hunting brands and asking them for a statement
that why are you collaborating with them?
As if that youre not liking it
You are not getting the deals
and these people are getting it
There are many such creators all over the world
who do very strange and big things
in fact there are many celebrities
who sell cancer
You go to those celebrities who promote such brands
You go to a creator who has a great track record
who even when in the fitness industry
used to talk about facts
While there are many people
who make and have been making very irresponsible videos
It is a big deal that those people get ranking in the big magazines of our country
It is a big deal
It is a big deal
It is a big deal
It is a big deal
You fall behind because of one or two references
Is this right or wrong
I would like to ask you this question
you guys tell me in the comments
Shefali says that some people are saying that
they will not even use brands
which are promoted by them
And Shefali quotes a gossip handle of a gossip community that it is posting
This gossip post of this gossip community
is it a good sample to tell
that people are not wanting to use this product
you tell me in this comment box
Or else it should be judged by that
what is the feature of the product which is promoted by him
How genuine is that product
what are the reviews of that product
what is the actual experience when you use that product
I would like to understand this from Shefali
whether she has done this research or not
You must have seen that
I do very little advertising of products on this channel
it is because I am not satisfied with that product
And if that was the case maybe it would make sense
Shefali highlights another issue
where Flying Beast is stating that about risks of live in relationship
and what can be its consequences
so on that basis
that your opinion doesnt match with her opinion
so he shouldnt be working with brands?
Brands shoulsnt work with him
Is it right?
He is just alerting people that he has seen and heard this
Such things come in the daily news
and if he is giving his opinion on it then what is wrong in it
He is saying that this is data
Have a look on the data
I am not saying that live in relationship is right or wrong
Infact I myself say that first stay with each other and see
But if you have data in front of you
and you are citing only that data have some problems
then because of this brands should not work with the creators
how far is it right or wrong I leave upto you Please tell
And I would like to ask that Shefali says in the same article
that all this is the fault of the brands not creators
There are brands in the title
and only Flying Beast is being talked about Why?
Shephali very smartly twists the article
This article is not for the Flying Beast
even though I am talking about the Flying Beast throughout the article
This article is not for Flying Beast it is for brands
What is Brands Responsibility?
I would like to ask you
what is the Responsibility of brands
Brands are commercial
they only see profit and use creators
They know that creators have real reach
their loyalty is direct connection
My audience has a connection with me
Ive connection with the people who are commenting below
When they listen to me they DMs me
that brother you speak on this You are our hope
and I feel responsible
Ive such connection with you guys
These journalists like Shefali will not be able to understand this
or generalists like Abhishek will not understand
what is your connection with me
how I make videos on your demand
and on my demand you do campaigns with me on Twitter
by devouting your precious time on my ask
Such journalists will not understand this
And I am not at all satisfied here with Shephali
that it is only the responsibility of the brands
I think it is the responsibility of the influencer to choose right product
It is the responsibility of the journalist
to write the article with full research and with no hatred
And the biggest responsibility here is not that of influencers and journalists
but your responsibility here is that
if someone is selling pan masala in the name of ad mouth freshener
then please condemn them
I think it is clear that there are many problems in this article
I think that is the reason
I am not saying that Flying Beast and Ritu Rathi are right in everything
They both also make mistakes
There is no human who doesnt make mistakes
Man is a mannequin of mistakes
I also make many mistakes
and it is very important to acknowledge my mistakes
Insinuating that performing Havan is a political propaganda
thats wrong
Talking about one or two things about someone that you think is wrong
saying on the basis that no one should work with him
thats wrong
You are insinuating on a post from someone of any gossip group
and when you are trolled on your article
then it becomes hatred
Isnt this hypocrisy?
Do you fall behind such a creator
who till date has not gone ahead on the basis of controversies
and has gone ahead on the basis of his content
vs you do not speak anything to people who are selling cancer
if this is not hypocrisy then what else?
If someone disagrees with you
should it be the result that you start attacking hisher livelihood
And here you see the pattern
that the person who is supplying you the content
is tweeting this again and again
these tweets are from a year ago imagine
A guy watches a movie and promotes it attack on him
A man says that the vaccine should be taken attack on him
You guys tell me whether its right or wrong
And you think that Intellectuals are right
and do not mislead you
you guys watch this video
its link is in the description and you will also see in the I button
I will say that if you like this video then share it in your community
dont forget to like and comment on this video
and share your opinion in this thread
We have two new communities on Facebook and Telegram
join them too
I am sharing their links
Because I think we should be present on all platforms
if we really need change to happen
Because youre watching Peepoye Im Akassh
And now
nothing will hide
