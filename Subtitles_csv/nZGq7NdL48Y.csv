Hello friends!
I wish you all a very happy Diwali in advance
Last year I made a video on Ramayana
in which I discussed how some people try to justify Ravana
They try to use illogical arguments to prove that
Ravana was not that bad
I countered those points in detail in that video
And in todays Diwali special video
I would like to focus on three things
First an allegation that many people put on Lord Ram
When Ram returned to Ayodhya
he left his pregnant wife Sita
Along with this some people also say that
Ram k!lled a Shudra named Shambuk
just because he was meditating
In fact these are two such things that
Dr Ambedkar mentioned in his booklet  Riddles of Ram and Krishna
The second thing is one of my old clips on Ramayana which is often shared on social media
Today I would like to clarify my opinion on Ramayana
And thirdly we will expose some people
who spread filth in society using Rams name
We will understand why it is important  to protect Ram from Nathuram
Come lets get to it
Friends you must have seen this in  some old movies and storybooks
When the story ends it says
And they lived happily ever after
Look at Chapter 128 of Valmikis Ramayana
This is the last Chapter of the sixth section  the Yuddha Kand
In this our story ends
Ram was crowned the king
Vibhishan returned to Lanka
Sugreev returned to Kishkindha
Ram asked Lakshman to rule as a Prince Regent
But when Lakshman refused
he appointed Bharat
After this in Shloka 95 to Shloka 106
Rams kingdom is described
This is the section which you can consider
as the and they lived happily ever after section
Ram carried out the Paundarika  Ashvamedha Vajapeya and other rituals
and pleased the Gods
There was no danger from wild animals
There were no diseases
There were no thieves or dacoits
People lived for thousands of years
without any disease or sorrow
The old people didnt have to  perform the last rites for young people
Trees bore fruits and flowers regularly
Clouds would rain at the right time
The touch of the wind was blissful
Brahmin Kshatriya Vaishya and Shudra
were doing their own work
They were satisfied with their work
were happy and without greed
Shloka 106 says
Sarve Lakshan Sampana
Sarve Dharm Parayana
Dash Varsh Sahetrasani
Ram Rajyam Karyat
It means that everyone had distinct qualities
and everyone behaved as per dharma
That is they behaved ethically
That is why Rams reign lasted for 10000 years
Now after hearing all this  one thing must have become clear to you
this is a happily ever after ending of the story
Think for yourself
does it make sense for the story to continue after this?
If our story was incomplete in any sense
then there was no need to write this  happily ever after section in such detail
And the thing is that the  allegations that are put on Ram here
that he left Sita and k!lled a Shudra
all of that is a part of Uttar Kand
And this Uttar Kand is an addition
that was added later to the Ramayana
An addition that forcefully  continues this happily ever after ending
There is a lot of evidence that  the story actually ended there
After this last happily ever after section
only one section remained in Ramayan
which is the section of Phalashruti
This tells you about the benefits
of listening to this particular scripture
The final Shloka is written in 125
This narration is to be listened  invariably by good people
seeking for wisdom longevity health
fame fraternity intelligence
welfare and brilliance
This is the ending of the original Valmikis Ramayan
In this same Phalashruti section
there is a verse Shloka 108
in which it is mentioned that
This foremost lyric  as written at first by Valmiki
Once again it is proved that
the scripture is complete at this point
Now it is important to mention here that
in Uttar Karna there are some things
that negate the story of Valmikis Ramayan
its in contradiction
For example we saw how Ram Rajya has been described
Everyone was happy
people from all sections of society were doing their work
and lived for thousands of years without any sorrow
But Shambuks story as written in the Uttar Kand
goes against this description
In this story a Brahmins son dies
which causes him immense grief
And after that Shambuk was k!lled by Ram
But Valmiki wrote in the end
that no old person had to perform  the last rites for their young son
Listen to another example
In this story Ram sits on the Pushpak Viman
and looks for Shambuk
But in Valmikis Ramayans Chapter 127  of the Yuddha Kand is was written that
When Ram returned to Ayodhya
he sent Pushpak Viman back to Kuber
And while were talking about Kuber
in Chapter 13 of the Uttar Kand it is written that
Ravan and other demons
were disrupting the rituals  performed by many sages and deities
Hearing this Kuber sent a messenger to Ravan
This messenger met Vibhishan first
and he took the messenger to Ravan
Ravan then k!lled that messenger with a sword
and demons ate his d3ad body
This part of the story is a prequel
to the story of Sitas abduction
But in Valmiki Ramayan when Sita is kidnapped
Ram sent several peace messengers to Ravan
First Angad then Hanuman
When Hanuman was brought to Ravan
Ravan wondered what to do with Hanuman
He asked Vibhishan for advice
In Sundarkand Chapter 52 Shloka 15
Vibhishan lists the acceptable punishments for messengers
Cutting off the limbs
hitting them with whips
shaving the head
making a mark on the body
And he goes on to say that they  hadnt heard about k!lling a messenger
If you believe the Uttar Kand to be true
had Ravan already k!lled Kubers messenger
why would Vibhishan say this?
So friends after seeing all this evidence  one thing becomes clear
Uttar Kand is not a part of the original Ramayan
It was added later
and the way it negates the original story
it should never be considered  as a continuation of Ramayan
Now you may be wondering
who wrote this Uttar Kand and when was it written?
Historically we dont have any solid evidence
but we can guess that
it is a story which
was added to promote Brahmanical superiority and casteism
To prove that Brahmins are superior to Shudras
And Sitas story looks like an obvious attempt
to promote patriarchy
That men have power
and men control women
It seems that some casteist  and sexist people in the society
added this continuation to Ramayana
to use it for their agenda back then
And if we talk about the agenda
there are still some people
who use the name of Ram
to promote wrong things in society
to promote bad habits
To use the slogans of Jai Shri Ram  while bullying and abusing women
And these people are hurt the most
by watching my videos on religion
They are bewildered by my  audacity to talk about religion
They do not like that I tell people  about the good aspects of religion
If people start learning good things from religion
then the religious polarity  they are trying to create wont work
Often people like these try to discredit me
by showing my old clips out of context  and sharing it on social media
about what I said earlier
This is one of my clips on Ramayan  that is shared by these people
So people say because that bridge exists
it is a part of our history
That this story did actually happen
But people think of it only at one level
they dont go deeper than that
Correct they wont question it they dont go deeper than that
Correct they wont question it Try applying some deductive reasoning to it
Does the existence of a manmade thing
prove that the whole story is real?
Isnt it the same logic that
since New York City is shown in Spiderman
and since New York City exists in real life
So Spiderman is also real  Spiderman exists too
That not how it works
In this clip I am talking about
how when I was a 7 or 8yearold kid
I heard the Ramayana and wondered how it could be possible
How could there be flying vessels in those days
and someone could lift a mountain and cross a sea?
When I was a kid I still didnt believe in these things
I added that these stories are like
Santa Claus stories
I was doing this interview with Karan Singh
a famous magicianmentalist
In the interview he talks about how  he used to go to the Gurudwara
when his parents insisted
but he too didnt believe in the existence of God
We were mostly talking about  deductive reasoning and atheism
To explain critical thinking and logical fallacy  I took the example of Spiderman
How in Spidermans comics
New York City is mentioned
New York City does exist in real life
but that doesnt mean that Spiderman is real
Similarly I said that if Ram Setu is real
it doesnt mean that the  stories told in Ramayana will be real
But I never said that Ramayana never happened
It is clear that Ramayana is a religious  scripture written at some point in history
Historians estimate that Valmikis Ramayana
was written between the 7th century and the 4th century BC
But did the stories written in this epic
actually take place or not?
Unfortunately we dont know about this
I personally believe that these  things may have happened in the past
But not in the way they have been written
I believe that this is a metaphorical epic
When it is said that Lord Hanuman picked up a mountain
and flew across the sea carrying it
this is not physically possible
even a child can understand this
But this may be written like a metaphor
Because often in writing and communication
metaphors are used in this way
If I want to say that Saurabh  works very hard and does so much
I might say that he is carrying  a mountain on his shoulders
Or there is the saying I will cross the seven oceans for you
If I say this to someone
it doesnt mean that I will literally  cross the seven oceans for them
Or that Saurabh is literally  carrying a mountain on his shoulders
The metaphor means that he is very hardworking
Crossing the seven oceans means  that I will put all my heart and soul into it
Apart from this it is also possible that
while writing Ramayan the Atishayokti Alankar was used
In literature writers and poets often  exaggerate while describing real events
For example have you seen the Hollywood film 300?
In this film a historic battle has been shown
between the Persians and the Greeks
Indeed this battle did actually happen
And the Greeks fought with great bravery
But many ancient authors and filmmakers
have exaggeratedly shown that
300 Spartans fought against 1 million Persians
This number is highly exaggerated
According to historical evidence
the Greek army of 700010000 soldiers  was there to help these 300 Spartans
And they did not fight 1 million Persians
The number of Persians is estimated to  have been between 70000 and 300000
No doubt it was a highly  disproportionate and historical battle
But in films poets and writers often exaggerate things
To show things as being larger than life
so that they can be more entertaining
By the way if you like these  historical and mythological stories
then I would recommend that you check out KUKU FM

With a thanks to KUKU FM for sponsoring this video
lets get back to the topic
One more example of this can be  seen in this India Today article
It is written that Maharana Pratap
used to carry a spear weighing 80 kg
And two swords which weighed 208 kg in total
And his armour weighed 72 kg
So in total he used to carry  360 kg while on the battlefield
Now no doubt Maharana Pratap was very brave and powerful
but carrying 360 kg on his body  while fighting on the battlefield
is physically impossible
This is an exaggeration by poets and writers
To find out the truth visit  the City Palace Museum in Udaipur
where the armour and weapons of Maharana Pratap are kept
Their weights are also mentioned there
35 Kg
So this is my opinion on Ramayana
But if any of you think that
it is possible to lift a mountain and fly over the sea
physically possible
then you are free to believe it
I dont have any problem if you believe this
Now there will be some people who
try to provoke me into saying something against Muslims
Accusing me of talking about Hinduism only
To that I would say
I have made a video on Abrahamic religions
which you can go and watch
In that I have clearly said that
there are some stories of Islamic and Christian scriptures
which are mythologies
Even though Prophet Muhammad  and Jesus Christ are historical figures
but the stories of miracles that are attached to them
are not historical
Neither scientists nor historians believe them to be true
So this is not just my personal opinion
Whether it is the story of Jesus Christ
about how he turned water into wine
Or the story of Prophet Muhammad
how he split the moon into two parts with his sword
Or the story of Lord Hanuman
how he swallowed the sun
All these are mythological stories
They have no place in science and history
I believe that these stories are metaphorical
Like we often say I am in heaven
I am very happy I am in a state of bliss
To split the moon
maybe like breaking centuriesold traditions
Or to swallow the sun
maybe like controlling fire
To establish control over your senses
From where does all the energy on Earth come from?
So what does it mean to swallow the sun?
The biggest natural thing that you can see
Lord Hanuman went and won it
Meaning he won over nature
It doesnt mean that he ate it as a fruit
There are messages hidden in all religious scriptures
But do you know what the problem is?
People are not concerned about the message
People are just stuck on their egos
They just want to prove that their religion is the best
Some people are even ready  to k!ll and hurt others to prove it
But they ignore the message
If you put your ego aside
you will realize that
it doesnt matter if Ram was a divine avatar
a human or just a literary character
Lord Ram is great because of his qualities
And thats why whether a person is a Hindu a Muslim
a Sikh a Christian a Buddhist  a Jain a Parsi a Jew or even an atheist
Ram is for everyone
You must have heard the saying
Rams name is greater than Ram
While using Rams name
recall his qualities
What values did he promote?
If you apply those values in your life  your life will be transformed
Ram is a great model of masculinity
Being fit and strong
but while being humble and compassionate
This is the reason why I call myself a Hindu Atheist
Because Hinduism has shaped my values
And culturally too I follow Hindu rituals
Not to humiliate anyone
like many socalled orthodox Hindus do today
But because I want to do it from the bottom of my heart
For myself
Rams name is mentioned so many  times in Haryanvi culture that
it is easy to remember all these things
Whenever we meet Ram Ram tau! Ram Ram brother
Whenever we leave we say Jai Ram ji ki! Victory to Lord Ram
The expression for being amazed Hey Ram! Oh Ram!
The expression for being sad Hey mere Ram ke karu? Oh my Ram what should I do?
When we sneeze Chhatrapati Ram ji Lord Ram
When it rains Ram ji baras gaye Lord Ram is raining
When there is confusion Ram jane ke hoya ke na Ram knows what will happen
When we have to swear Ram ki soon I swear by Ram
But today friends Rams name is in danger
Rams name is being dragged through the mud
You would have heard the saying
Talking about Ram following Nathuram
To live in India  You have to say Jai Shri Ram!
This has become a fact today
Mahatma Gandhi was a great Ram devotee
But today the followers of Nathuram Godse
are trying to hijack Ram
Nathuram Godse was a patriot
He is and will be
I consider Godse to be like a God
Godse is someone we look up to
Are you against Godse?  Hear me out
Are you against Godse or not?
Tell the nation No I am not
We see reports of how some degenerates of society
force others to say Jai Shri Ram
News from Madhya Pradesh
Uttar Pradeshs Bulandshahr
Kanpur Unnao Ghaziabad
Rajasthans Alwar
Delhi Assam Jharkhand
Gujarat Haryana Himachal
Bihar Hyderabad Telangana
Say Jai Shri Ram!
SAY IT!
This type of news comes in  from every corner of the country
People are k!lled burnt alive l!nched
in the name of Ram
If you show such news to these people
they will talk about Muslims who use the slogans of
Do you support the slogans of ?
No because no normal person supports such slogans
But the mindset of these people is that
if a Muslim person does wrong  then we will do it too
If someone else is jumping into a well  they would want to jump in too
If their purpose is to copy Muslims
then they can copy great Muslims
like Dr APJ Abdul Kalam
Dr Salim Ali the Birdman of India
or Mohammad Rafi
But no they want to copy
Muslim extremists only
Islamic t3rror!st Osama Bin Laden Hafiz Saeed
who brought shame to Islam
Now these degenerates dressed in saffron
are ruining the name of Ram similarly
Allahu Akbar means God is great
Its a good reminder
But while attacking Islamic t3rror!sts have  used this chant so many times all over the world
Look at the news
They have chanted Allahu Akbar
They have shouted Allahu Akbar
He pulled out a knife and attacked shouting Allahu Akbar
The call to prayer Azaan starts with Allahu Akbar
Which gives you a feeling of peace from the inside
I personally love Azaan
when we were shooting for Tanu Manu in Lucknow
I loved the sound of it
But the extremists use this slogan like a war cry
during t3rror!st attacks
Similarly Jai Shri Ram
is a slogan that should bring peace to your heart
But now what do we see?
a violent mob of people
carrying swords and weapons in their hands
and chanting Jai Shri Ram
Look at these news articles
We Hindus go to temples to pray
but these people and their weapons
reach mosques during Hindu festivals
They use the name of Lord Ram  to raise slogans of g3nocide
They often write on social media
Dharmo Rakshati Rakshit
They say that they are doing  this to protect their religion
Dharma Rakshati Rakshit
Religion protects those who protect it
They say that they are protecting the religion
But do you know where this quote has been taken from?
From Manusmriti
Do you know what is the definition of Dharma in this?
It is like this
There are 10 characteristics of Dharma
Patience forgiveness restraint
not stealing cleanliness
controlling of senses
increasing intelligence
gaining knowledge
practising truth and remaining calm
But do these people follow any of these characteristics?
No one is doing it
They use social media to insult and degrade others
In Mahabharata it is written again and again
Ahimsa Parmodharam  nonviolence is the utmost duty
In Ramcharitmanas Tulsidas says
Parhitsaris Dharm Nahi Bhai
Parh Pida Sam Nahi Adhmai
Theres nothing more important than helping others
Theres nothing worse than harming others
Valmiki Ramayana Ayodhya Kand Chapter 14 Shloka 3
those who have knowledge of Dharma
say that Truth is the ultimate Dharma
Dharma means to do your moral duty
to fulfil your duties
But today some people use Dharma
to honour rpists
get the Mahapanchayat to support the l!nching accused
create apps to auction women
I want to challenge these degenerates
Show even one Shloka in Valmiki Ramayana
which validates this hatred
But these people will accept the challenge only if
they know how to read and write
Thats why I would say friends  that the wise Hindus need to unite
and raise our voices against them
so that we can save Ram from Nathuram
So that no one can fool you in the name of religion
read the religious scriptures yourself
I am putting the link to the entire  Valmikis Ramayana in the description below
And when you get time read it
and see what values are taught in it
Jai Jai Ram Jai Siya Ram!

Thank you very much!
