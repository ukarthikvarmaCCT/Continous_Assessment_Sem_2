Hello friends!
In 1875
a girl was born in the small town of Arles France
Jeanne Louise Calment
It was a time when cars and aeroplanes
were not yet invented
People used to travel by horsedrawn carriages
People used candles to light their homes
At this time no human being in the world
would have even dreamt
that this girl would make history
She will live such a long life
such a long life
that she will break all the world records
In 1889 Louise was only 14 years old
when the Eiffel Tower was built in Paris
In 1896
when Louise got married at the age of 21
Mahatma Gandhi had just moved to South Africa
By the way Mahatma Gandhi
was only 6 years older than Lewis
Fast forward to 1914
when Louise was only 39 years old
and was living a happily married life
and had a daughter
A huge explosion shook Europe
World War I began
In 1934
when Hitlers rise was being seen in Germany
there was an unfortunate tragedy in Louises family
Her daughter died of a lung infection
She was 59 years old then
59 is an age when
most women have become grandmothers
But Louise herself would have never imagined
that her life was not even half complete
In 1942 World War II was in full rage in Europe
Millions of people lost their lives in this war
Millions of people were separated from their families
And something similar happened at Louises home too
When she was 64 years old
she lost her husband
In 1947 Prime Minister Nehru hoisted the flag of independent India
India gained independence from the British
Louise was 72 years old at that time
And she was watching the pages of history turning unknowingly
In her life horses were replaced by cars
and candles by electricity
In 1969 when she celebrated her 94th birthday
humans stepped on the moon
One small step for man
A giant leap for mankind
In 1985
Rajiv Gandhi got a historic victory in the Indian elections
In India the IT revolution was just about to begin
At that time Louise was 110 years old
She was happily living in her house till now
but after this point
she moved to a nursing home
In 1988
the world finally started to pay attention to Louise
She was being discussed everywhere
she was in the news for being the oldest living human
In 1997 at the age of 122
when Louise passed away
the age of computers and the internet had already begun
Jeanne Louise Calment
crossed all the limits of imagination
She made a record that
no one has ever been able to break yet
What was the reason behind it?
What is the secret of living such a long life?
Lets find out in todays video
The first thing that comes to your mind is that
obviously luck was involved
This is true
if you want to live for 122 years
you will need a lot of luck
But the question here is that
in living such a long life
how much contribution is of luck
and how much of it is your lifestyle choices?
Between 1870 and 1900
scientific research was conducted in Denmark on twins
More than 2800 twins were analyzed
to study longevity and to see
how big is genetics as a factor
and how big are lifestyle and environment as factors
This research was known as the famous Danish twin study
And the conclusion of this was that
an average humans life
is 20 dictated by genes
and 80 is influenced by lifestyle and environment
That means your food choices
the way you exercise
and a healthy lifestyle
has a huge impact
on how long you will live
And a big impact of all these factors is on your hair
To some extent hair loss is natural
and it depends on genetics along with age
But to some extent it also depends on your lifestyle
Medically hair loss is categorised into 7 stages
If you are in between stages 1 to 4
then it can be controlled
after identifying the root cause
But if you are beyond stage 5
then it becomes more difficult to get your hair back
Then risky and expensive surgical procedures like hair transplants
remain the only options
So if you are in between stages 1 and 4
its not too late
and Traya can help you

Now lets get back to the topic
The next question is
what are the healthy lifestyle choices
that can help you live a long life?
The best way to figure this out is perhaps to
do a reverse research
To see the lifestyle of those
who are already living for such a long time
In the early 2000s Dan Buettner
an explorer and author was working for National Geographic
He decided to study such places in the world
where people live the longest
In 2003 he collaborated with
anthropologists historians dietitians and geneticists
to complete this mission
They used population data
to locate such areas in the world
where the most number people of ages 100 and above are found
These people are called centenarians because
they have lived a century
Around this time some other people were also researching the same thing
Like this research paper
that was published in
the Journal of Experimental Gerontology
Here they identified that
in the Sardinia region of Italy
the highest concentration of male centenarians is found
Those who are 100 years or above
The Italian villages with the highest concentration of these people
were marked by blue circles on the map
These places were referred to as the Blue Zone
On the other hand Dan Buettner found another such place
The Japanese Okinawa Island
With the longest disabilityfree life  expectancy in the world found there
They set out on an expedition to these places
to find out why people lived for so long here
The team of scientists and demographers explores the world
and finds five such Blue Zones
The first was Sardinia in Italy
Second Okinawa in Japan
Third in the American state of California
Loma Lindas Seventhday Adventist community
It is a religious sect within Christianity
Fourth the island of Icaria in Greece
And fifth the region of the Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica
People living in these five blue zones
live a longer life than the rest of the world
Is there anything special about these places?
Maybe the clean water and clean air here
or is it the lifestyle choices of these people
that facilitates this
Dan and his team worked for years to find out the real reason
And finally when they publish their report
they say that the real reason was
the lifestyle habits of the residents
Specifically 9 lifestyle habits
were common across these regions
They refer to these 9 habits as Power 9
What are these habits?
Lets find out one by one
so that you can learn from them
implement them in your life
and live a long life
The first lifestyle habit is
to Move Naturally
Its not that the elderly people living in blue zones
go to the gym and lift heavy weights regularly
or run a marathon
In fact their environment encourages
small natural movements throughout the day
For example most of these people live in villages
where cars are not used much
In fact if they want to go to meet their friends
or go to work
they have to walk
Along with that these people grow their gardens near their homes
where they go and work by themselves
Contrast this with the modern world
where nowadays most people sit at home
get in the car and go to the office
where they sit and work
And if they want to go somewhere for entertainment
they get in the car
and go to the cinema hall to watch a movie while they sit and relax
Natural walking is so rare in our modern lifestyle
The American Cancer Society surveyed more than 125000 adults
and found that people who sit for more than 6 hours a day
have a 19 higher chance of dy!ng in the next 21 years
Cancer coronary heart disease
stroke diabetes kidney disease
liver disease Parkinsons disease
Alzheimers nervous disorders
a total of 14 causes of deth
become more likely to occur the more you remain seated
Many studies have shown a major correlation here
Look at the latest study which states that
by walking at least 11 minutes every day
the risk of premature deth
is reduced by 25
Just by walking for 11 minutes
But obviously in the case of blue zones
natural walking is much more common
The more you include natural walking in your daily life
the better it is
Now walking uses specific muscles of the legs
but it is very important to naturally move every muscle in the body
What we see in Okinawa is that
people dont have a lot of furniture in their homes
Instead of using dining tables
people sit on the floor to eat
What is the benefit of this?
They have to sit down and get up at least 34 times a day
More natural movement
The simple logic is to
try to incorporate natural movements in daily life as much as possible
You can buy a standing desk instead of a normal desk
You can sit on the floor and eat instead of at the dining table
In many places in India this has been the traditional way
And instead of using a car
use a cycle or walk as much as possible
The second point is purpose
Dans researchers found that in Okinawa
there is no concept like retirement
In fact there is a Japanese concept called Ikigai
It means a reason for being
What is the purpose of my life?
To have a sense of purpose
When people in Japan turn 90100 years old
they dont retire and give up on life
Instead they find the Ikigai of their life
A similar concept has been seen in Costa Ricas Blue Zone
called Plan de Vida
which translates to a Life Plan
Dans research found that having a sense of purpose in life
can increase life expectancy by up to 7 years
Now the interesting thing is that
to have a life purpose doesnt necessarily mean
a purpose that will transform the world
The things that give you longterm satisfaction in daily life
that gives you internal happiness
those things can also be your purpose
For example volunteering for an NGO
becoming skilled in an art or craft
or picking up any hobby that you enjoy doing
Point number 3 Downshift
We all know that stress is not good for us
But do you know that chronic stress
a stress that you have to endure for a long period
can be very harmful to your health?
According to a study by Yale
if you are under a lot of chronic stress
your age faster
Many studies have repeatedly shown that
due to chronic stress
the risk of heart attack increases
the risk of diabetes increases
and the risk of cancer increases
Almost every agerelated disease is associated with stress
Look at this article
According to one study if you are stressed at work
your life can be shorter by 33 years
What is special about people living in blue zones?
Its not that they dont get stressed
The thing is that they have made such habits in their daily routines
that allows them to remain stressfree
Okinawans take some time every day to remember their ancestors
Adventists of California pray
Icarians of Greece take a nap in the afternoon
and Sardinians of Italy practice the happy hour
These are the things that help them reduce their stress levels
Okinawans have a special place in their home
which is called Butsudan
where they can honour their ancestors
And Adventists of California practice spiritual prayer
So one interesting thing to note here is that
praying to God is also
an effective way to reduce your stress
And taking naps in the afternoon
sleeping for 12 hours
research has proved that it improves your cardiovascular health
and helps you lower the levels of stress
On the other hand the way to reduce stress for Sardinians is
through social interaction
They have a happy hour from 5 PM to 7 PM
when they meet their friends and family
So the lesson here is that
you should also have a daily ritual in your life
to reduce your stress
Whether you do yoga meditation pray to God
go to church and pray offer Namaz
spend time with your family
nap in the afternoon or
participate in some sports or exercise
It is important not to get stressed
Fourth point 80 rule
In Japan there is a phrase called Harahachibu
Which means to eat until you are 8 parts full
While eating eat only so much
that your stomach is only 80 full
Dont eat so much that you are 100 full
In Okinawa this practice is followed
which reminds people to stop eating after they are 80 full
In the 4th century BC Ayurvedic medicine also described this principle
It says to fill up 13rd your stomach with the liquid
13rd with the food
and leave the remaining 13rd empty
Generally there are proven scientific benefits of eating less food
And the interesting thing is that
fasting has been a part of almost every religion or culture for centuries
Hindus fast during Navratri
Muslims fast during Ramadan
and some Christians fast before Easter
Scientists have found that fasting has many scientific benefits
Last year Yale School published a clinical trial
It found that those who cut their calorie intake by 14
saw many health improvements in their life
Their ageing pace slowed down
In 1935 a scientist Clive McCay
made a shocking discovery on rats
He gave rats little food
and found that the lifespan of rats
increased by 33 by doing this
Similar experiments have been done on many  different animals in the last few decades
Be it worms rats or monkeys
Specific details vary from study to study
but every study came to the same conclusion
By eating less food regularly
lifespan extends from 50 to 300
Point number 5 Plant Slant
The diet of most of the people in the blue zone
is a plantslant diet
This diet is mostly a plantbased vegetarian diet
In the blue zones either people dont eat meat at all
or if they do it is a small part of their meal
In the diets of all these centenarians
a large amount of beans is seen
Whether it is fava beans black beans
soybeans or literally lentils
In places like Okinawa people do eat pork
but on average they eat it only 5 times a month
But apart from this in all blue zones
whole grains are eaten a lot
Various types of vegetables are eaten a lot
And tubers are eaten a lot
Tubers are anything that grows under the ground
Like sweet potatoes or potatoes or nuts or beans
In California the blue zone community called Loma Linda
there people are fully vegetarian
and some of them are vegan
In 2023 an analysis was done analyzing multiple research studies
between 1980 and 2022
where vegetarian and vegan diets were observed
And the conclusion was that
eating a plantbased diet reduces the risk of several diseases
Diabetes Dementia High Blood Pressure Obesity
Colon Cancer Breast Cancer Prostate Cancer
And the metaanalysis by Dan on the PlantSlant Diet
found that in these 5 blue zones
the centenarians that were surveyed
95 of them ate plantbased diets
Point number 6
This is a largely controversial point
Dans research found that in most blue zones
except for the California blue zone
people consumed alcohol in moderate amounts
For example in Sardinia
people drink 12 glasses of red wine every day
If you look at old research papers
many such researches show that
drinking red wine in moderation can be good for health
The reason behind this is
the antioxidants present in red wine like Resveratrol
It increases the amount of good cholesterol in the body
But this is the only point
that has perhaps become outdated
Because the latest research and studies tell us that
even a small amount of alcohol can be harmful to you
That is drinking zero alcohol is the healthiest
This shows that the centenarians living in the blue zones
are living a long life
not because of drinking wine
but despite drinking wine
The beneficial antioxidant in red wine resveratrol
is also found in grape juice actually
And even better than grape juice
it is found in grapes
So if you want to benefit from this
simply eat grapes
Point number 7 is Belong
which can be called the sense of belonging
263 centenarians were interviewed
and every one of them except 5
was part of some faithbased community
It doesnt matter which religion you believe in
or whether you believe in religion or not
You must become a part of a social or spiritual community
This community can be your religious community as well
Any community that gives you a purpose
peace and a positive outlook in life
Another way to get this is
to do community service
volunteer help people or do charity
You can get this sense of belonging even then
Dans research found that this is so important that
for people who attend faithbased services 4 times a month
their life expectancy increases from 414 years
Imagine you will live for 14 more years by doing this
Point number 8 Loved Ones First
Centenarians from the blue zone prioritize their family
Either they live in the area around their ageing parents and grandparents
or they live with them in the same home
Apart from this they remain committed to their one life partner
with whose help according to Dans research
life expectancy can increase by 3 years
And then they invest their time and affection in their children
Finally we come to the last 9th point
which is Right Tribe
Okinawans have a friend circle of about 5 friends
and they are committed to their 5 friends for the rest of their lives
People living in blue zones are part of such social circles
that support these healthy behaviours
Many research papers show that
things like smoking obesity
happiness and loneliness are contagious
If your friend circle is made up of such people
who promote good habits
and not bad habits
then it can be very beneficial for you
The reason behind this is very simple
Following healthy behaviours becomes very easy
when people around you are following the same healthy behaviours
After listening to all this you must be thinking
Is it possible to live a long life outside these 5 blue zones?
Dan wondered the same thing as well
In his opinion
a 6th blue zone can be added to this group soon
A blue zone where traditionally people didnt have a healthy lifestyle
but in the future due to their changing behaviour
they can definitely become a new blue zone
Dan says that he has witnessed
life expectancy in Singapore increasing by almost 25 years
Today people living in Singapore
have one of the longest and healthiest life expectancies
The reason behind this is the policies made by the government
which subsidize healthy food
and impose heavy taxes on junk food
Government policies promote walking
The infrastructure is designed to make  people walk more in their daily lives
And there is a heavy tax on driving to discourage it
Another interesting thing in Singapore is that
if your elderly parents live within a radius of 500 yards of your house
you get a tax break
So the result is in front of you friends
Now you know exactly what you have to do to live a long life
You may not be able to break the record of being the worlds oldest human
You may need a lot of luck to live for 120 years
But if you follow the things I have told you in this video
you will easily live for a century
If you liked the video you can watch this video
on the worlds fattest country
In this video I told you about extremely positive examples
In that video I will tell you about an extremely negative example
of what you should not do
