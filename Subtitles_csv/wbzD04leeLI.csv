So I saw this video in my suggested
It was about UltraEver Dry
which is apparently as good at repelling water
as I am women
Look at how water just runs off this paper
and how this tissue
which I remind you should be absorbing the water
is instead playing God
Instantly a million questions flood in my mind
Like what happens if you put this
on a boat and put the boat in water?
Or can I put this on my feet and walk on water?
These were just things I needed to know
So I went to Amazon and I bought a couple gallons
of this stuff and this was the result
So like any logical person
the first question I needed answered was
if I spray this stuff on my underwear
can I just pee in them all the time and it stay dry?
Chris some of my pees still on the underwear
Youve got some pretty thick pee
What do we do?
Hey it never happened
Yeah I dont think we sprayed both sides
Look at that
Next I wanted to test a clip
EverDry had in their video
This shirt is covered in EverDry
This designer Supreme shirt isnt
Wait no they only did the front of his shirt
Not the back
Im super disgusting
Come up here
I have grass in me
Why do I have grass in me?
You can see a clear difference
This is the front
So its got the water drops on but theyll come off
And then this is the back
Look at my tie though
My ties spot on here
Well just dunk the whole tie
That actually is pretty cool
Splash back cause I think my mouth was open
Paper towel covered iEverDry versus ketchup
Its not working like it did in the video
I dont know what demonic crap theyre doing
but my ever drive must be broke
Now if you guys have ever used a paper towel before
now if you guys have ever used to pay for towel before
not quite sure why I thought some
of you have never used a paper towel before
Of course theyve fucking used a paper towel before
You know it absorbs water
Look at this
Its not absorbing water
You can throw it
This is a roll of paper towels
Wow its actually not really that wet
Waterproofing my underwear worked so well that when I pee
in the middle of the night it just runs up my bedsheets
So of course now we have to waterproof my bedsheets
In this clip we covered a cotton ball and EverDry
and I think Chris summed it up perfectly
That ones pretty cool
We then took a bagel which oddly enough
looks like a butthole and waterproofed it
I feel like a bagel
would be kind of waterproof anyway
Afterwards we waterproof a wallet
and I just realized leather is waterproof
so that was unnecessary
Chris youre fired
I wanna dump this cinder block in this water
but its really heavy
You rang?
Yeah that was my viking call
Hey can you dip this in the water tank for me?
Its like its really heavy but youre like a big boy
Now we lift it out
And look thats the part with EverDry
Thats the part without it
Hm  All right Mr Viking
you can go
Okay  Remember guys
if you ever need a Viking just go
Then we waterproofed my merch because apparently
I havent plugged it in the last five videos and yeah
not plugging your merch equals no sales
Yeah thats been pretty rough
Did you miss?
Hey it worked
Thats where the EverDry is and look at it
just running down and not sticking like it is
Holy crap the EverDry comes all the way back here
Jake you got it on as Yeezys
No did I really?  Yeah
This is like the fifth time youve hit me with an egg
Keep going oh my God
I dont think the EverDrys working
on the side of the van
Here let me try
I missed
The EverDrys over there  Oh its where?
Its in the back of the van  Oh okay
Ah crap I missed again
See right there?  Oh
Its not right there  Okay
Its not right there  Okay okay
Its more like right there  Gotcha
And you were throwing like right there
Gotcha gotcha
So I shouldnt be throwing right there
Be throwing right here right?
Ah crap I got my pants wet
Here chris can you give me that towel?
You should have waterproofed your pants man
Yeah I know
Wait a minute
This towels waterproof
How am I supposed to clean my pants
but when the towels waterproof?
It doesnt do anything
Look water just bounces off
Well I guess my pants will forever be wet
cause every towel here is waterproof
I dont think your hands waterproof either
Your hand got more wet than the towel
Oh yeah look at that
Nonwaterproof look at that crappy hand
Theres nothing good about this hand at all
In that clip we were talking about Chriss hand
which clearly meant we were about to start talking
about him moisturizing
And now Im sitting here listening
to two grown men talking about Chris moisturizing
And Im just wondering where I went wrong with life
So in EverDrys official video
they did this thing where they outlined their logo
in EverDry and then shot paint at it
and it looked really cool
So I thought Id redo it
in my office by spelling out shop MrBeast on the wall
Hey look it worked  No Chris it didnt work
Not quite sure what the fuck youre looking at
We then made the big mistake of giving two man childs paint
and a hot dog
Flying wiener
Stop playing Fortnite
We have to make videos
Dude every YouTuber makes Fortnite videos
Just gimme a couple months to get good
and well be fine way easier
Way easier than what we currently do
Im sick of it dude
You know what?  I just wanna
be like every YouTuber
Yeah I knew you would do that
Thats why I waterproofed my keyboard
Watch this
Its still like pretty  up
Well darn I guess I cant play anymore Fortnite
Now we have to go
All right I guess Ill make videos
I know a lot of you guys out there are atheists
and for all of you atheists please explain this
This is how a paper normally reacts
when its hit with water
Pretty stereotypical
Now watch this
If its a piece of paper
with PewDiePie on it look how it reacts
It just bounces right off of him
So atheist out there explain that
Hm  Explain it!
Its like it never happened
This is how a burrito normally reacts to water
As you can see its just yeah
See this is a terrible burrito
This is how a Chipotle burrito reacts to water
Its kind of the same
We waterproofed this right guys?
Why does waterproofing not work on burritos?
Now we have burrito on the floor
Theres so much rice everywhere
They ask you how you are
and you just have to say that youre fine
And youre not really fine but you just cant get
into it because they would never understand
A lot of you guys are really young
So heres a recommendation
for all you parents watching with your young kids
See instead of changing their diapers all the time
just waterproof them and you can just use
the same diaper forever
Chris my work gloves are kind of dry
will you moisturize them for me?
Im a moisturizing expert
Yeah?  Here we go
Okay all right  There you go
Chris the moisture it just falls off
It appears my gloves are waterproof
which means theyre moisture proof
What do we do?
Moisturize the stress away
Give it to me boss  Here
My gloves are still waterproof
My hands are covered in moisturizer
But mine arent  Im super moisturized
But Im not oh
All right that was dumb
We then proceeded to torture Alexa by dipping her
in water as punishment for not reordering my wet wipes
Oh whoa!
Yeah all right lets see how long it stays on
Wait Alexas waterproof?  No
Oh God
This is not a good idea
Thats pretty cool
Alexa dont give up
Theres a reason Jeff Bezos
is the richest man in the world
Yeah  Google Home
on the other hand was listening to a conversation
I had one time in my living room
and now Im on the FBI watch list
So take this Google Home
So this one literally will not come on
If we unplug it plug this back in watch it wait for it
Up next we have a metaphor for you guys
These boots are the Beast Gang Paulers
And this water is the haters
The haters they just brushed right off
The haters cant touch us Beast Gang Paulers
We just dab all over em
Were the strongest most litest family on the internet
We look at that
The haters are trying to touch us bullock
Even when the haters pile up we just do that
Boom theyre gone
Those boots really dont
like Mountain Dew do they?
Oh gosh
While we have this sacrifice going
I think its time we replace our memes
Lets replace our memes
Hiro  Lets burn
our old memes
Donating to attractive Twitch streamers
Its saying I was milking it
Am I gonna die?
Memes are fun to burn
Oh  Yeah
Our second meme that must be burnt is PewDiePie
It says meme review in Japanese
Be gone PewDiePie
Its smokey in here
I know is our fire alarm gonna oh wait
we dont have one
We disabled our fire alarm
cause we do so many indoor videos
Record it  Our next meme is
is this good content?
We all know its good content
Lets put the fire right on PewDiePies face
Adding nt a word doesnt make it funny
PewDiePie reviewed it which means now the memes dead
So this one really has to burn
Trying not to breathe and die
See look guys this tissue is waterproof
Look at that
Were gonna use the waterproof tissue to put out the fire
Oh take that fire
Okay hand it to me
Sorry Im not trying to die
Well this went from a normal video
to lets burn stuff indoors and yeah
The moment youve all been waiting for
We put water repellent on the bottom
of these Dundee flip flops
Millions of years of evolution have led us to this
Will water repellent on my feet allow me to walk on water?
Maybe you should walk out a little further
Maybe it just needs to take  Maybe yeah
Oh God Im losing my foot
Whered it go?
Oh God
Okay all right
Well I lost my flip flop
Oh I lost that one
All right
Well Im just gonna walk in defeat
Ha ha da feet
MrBeast oh
MrBeast oh
MrBeast oh
