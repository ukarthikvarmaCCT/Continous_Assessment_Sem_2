Every year over 200000 children
are born without the ability to smile
and even worse breathe properly
99 of people are born like this
with a full ability to breathe through their nasal airway passage
However the other 1 look like this
with a cleft lip or palate
which makes life terribly difficult
for these children as they grow up
In poorer areas there is no way for many of these people
to get healthcare meaning thousands of them
grow up without ever having the opportunity to receive surgery
which results in bullying and social isolation
But there is one organization
that is making a big difference in communities all around the world
Meet Kathy
40 years ago my husband and I
were asked to go to the Philippines
We landed in sites one after the next
and we saw 300 children with cleft lip and palates
We just didnt know what to do
We said lets do what we can
and we were able to do 40
The rest we had to turn away
So we said to ourselves
okay well we should go back
We should at least finish
This was the start of Operation Smile
and in 40 years
theyve been able to achieve over 400000
successful surgeries for patients in 36 countries
all around the world
However in Mexico the number of
cleft cases are quickly increasing and
becoming difficult to maintain alone
They desperately need our help
So Darren and Dan flew to
Puebla Mexico a city with rich
Latin history and culture
On their arrival Dan got the rare opportunity to showcase
this incredible city from above by being invited
to ring the cathedral bell at first light
They were welcomed by Mauricio
I started with Operation Smile 11 years ago
One of the reasons
why I wanted to dedicate my life into nonprofits
is because in Mexico
theres a huge gap between people
that can actually have access to any surgery
I met a young lady
and when she came to one of our surgical programs
she had a bruised eye
They threw stones at her
because of the way she spoke
It just broke my heart
This is one of the consequences of a cleft
I always say that behind the patient
theres a story
and behind the story you have a human
And I decided to dedicate my life
to the cleft cause in Mexico
We met a young child and he is one of the sweetest kids
Ive ever met in my entire life
But he has a terrible disfigurement on his face
And this child is so sweet
and so loving
but it breaks my heart knowing the bullying that
he is going to face as he grows up
One of these patients is Emmanuel
17 months ago he was born with a bilateral cleft palate
He is the son of Jernimo
a single father who lives in
the rural mountains of Chiapas
The cost of health care has
proven to be extremely expensive for him
as he barely makes enough money to support his son
Meaning that his only hope is to travel by bus for 17 hours
to Puebla for the only
chance of being selected for a surgery
And if not selected it may be the last chance Jernimo
has to get this opportunity for his son
If you look out at any one
of these programs what we see are masses
Its not like 10 children 2 children
Its masses of kids and families
We screen these families
You know we look in their face
But if you look down
you see no shoes on their feet
They will do anything for their child
I can only imagine the pain
for a parent when they have
a child that desperately needs a surgery and they cannot afford
to provide it for them themselves
And when we saw just how difficult
this was for these families
we knew we had to help
So we decided to pay for
over 100 surgeries
The next day after the screening process was complete it was time
for the patient selection
Jernimo was extremely anxious because
he wasnt sure if his son would be selected
Today is a very emotional day for me
Behind me we have the patients
and were going to do the surgical announcement
They are about just to be told
that theyre going to be having
a life change forever
97 patients had already been selected
and Jernimo started to lose hope
It was time for patient number 99
He did it
Just look at the relief on his face
Seeing the hope in these parents faces when they bring these children
to this clinic knowing that theyre
finally going to get the medical
care that they need is truly an experience that moves the heart
Emmanuels surgery would take the whole day
So while the doctors operated
Dan and Darren went to explore the city
We were walking through the park
and we just found a Mariachi band
And its always been a dream of Darrens
to join a Mariachi band
So hopefully I can make his dream come true
My friend over there
he wants to join the band
I got you a hat
I think we have to shut this down
This is terrible
That was one of the greatest experiences of my life
That shows you how boring Darrens life is
Emmanuels surgery is now complete
And this will be the first time
Jernimo will ever see his son smile
One of my favorite moments in
the surgical program is when
the kid comes out of surgery
Because this is the first time
that the parents are going to see the kids with the surgery
Its just such an emotional moment
Because you change the life not only of the patient
but the family and the society
Our patients are going to have
the opportunity to actually have a normal life
A healed cleft means that all
of these children will grow up
not having to worry about being bullied
And on top of these extraordinary surgeries
Operation Smile also provides all of their patients with free speech
and vocal therapy
Meaning that they will learn how to speak clearly and fluently
But we had one more surprise left
Kathy told us about a young nursing student Fernanda who was treated
by Operation Smile 17 years ago
I knew I wanted to study nursing
because I wanted to help kids like me
When you go home
You tell your family that they dont have to pay for you anymore
Were gonna give you a full scholarship
And well pay for you to finish your nursing school
I think youre going to be an excellent nurse
Thank you  Thank you vey much
Dan come over here
Alright look at this man
If you dont subscribe
he will literally cry right now
Dont worry they subscribed so you dont have to
Just end it like that
And one more thing
Operation Smile is amazing
and theyre doing incredible work all around the world
We want to help them continue
to be able to provide these
surgeries to children all around the world
In other words if you dont donate to Operation Smile
you just hate kids
