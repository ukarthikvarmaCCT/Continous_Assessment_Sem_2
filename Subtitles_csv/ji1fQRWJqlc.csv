Hello friends!
In 1854 when India was under British Colonial rule
the then Governor General Lord Dalhousie
sent a 15yearold child from Punjab to England
Lord Dalhousie believed that
the mother of this child was a threat and had a bad character
and so it was important to take him away from the mother
In England this child converts to Christianity
and becomes fast friends with Queen Victorias son Edward VII
The responsibility of this child was given to the British Crown
and an annual stipend was paid to him
of 50000
If you adjust it for inflation today
it would amount to 650 million per year
Friends this child wasnt an ordinary boy
he was Prince Duleep Singh
Known as Maharaja Duleep Singh as well
The last ruler of the Sikh Empire in India
Interestingly 4 years before he was sent to England
in 1849 when the British defeated the Sikhs in the battle
Lord Dalhousie had ordered the 11yearold Duleep
to surrender a diamond to Queen Victoria
This was the Kohinoor Diamond
That year it travelled 6700 km on a ship to go to London
A legend attached to the Kohinoor diamond states that
He who owns this diamond will own the world
But will also know all its misfortunes
It is a superstition
known as the Curse of Kohinoor
Because friends every person who owned Kohinoor
had lived lives full of bloodshed violence and betrayals
This is the most infamous diamond in history
In todays video
come lets us delve into the interesting story of KohiNoor
The Kohinoor Diamond
is kept in the Tower of Londons Jewel House
for many years
but there have been regular demands to get it back from Britain
The Kohinoor diamond during the rule of the British
was taken from India to Britain
And became the jewel of the Queens crown
I saw the Kohinoor
The first eyewitness description of it
I saw the Kohinoor
it was attached to the head of the peacock
on top of the Peacock Throne
Friends there are many prevalent theories regarding this
About the origin of Kohinoor
Where was it discovered?
A civil servant working for the East India Company
Theo Metcalfe
wrote in his report that according to tradition
this diamond was extracted during
the lifetime of Krishna
But according to historians
the most accepted view is that
this diamond was found in the Kollur Mines
in the Golconda region
Dont confuse it with the Kolar Mining area
which was popularised in the KGF film
The Golconda diamonds are found on the banks of the Krishna River
On coastal Andhra Pradesh
During the 18th century this area
was the only area in the world
where diamonds could be found
Until 1725 when diamond mines were discovered in Brazil
It isnt clear who was the one to discover the Kohinoor diamond and how
but normally the gemstones are found on the river beds of driedup rivers
Historically we dont even know
when was it discovered exactly
The best estimates of the historians claim that
it was discovered between the years 11001300
It is believed that the first mention of Kohinoor was in a Hindu text in 1306
The problem is that
no one knows the name of the text
Nor does anyone know who wrote it
The first written record of the mention of Kohinoor was in 1526
When the first Mughal emperor Zahirudin Babur came to India in 1526
In Baburnama he had written that
it is a diamond which
is worth half the daily expense of the whole world
It is believed that he had won the Kohinoor diamond as a prize
for winning a particular battle
The second mention of Kohinoor was by Shah Jahan in 1628
When he commissioned his famous Peacock Throne
It took 7 years for this throne to be finished
And it was four times as expensive as the Taj Mahal
A large amount of precious stones and gems were used to make this throne
but of tnumbert precious gems
one was the Kohinoor diamond
and the other was the Red Timur Ruby
An interesting fact
the Kohinoor wasnt the most precious gen owned by the Mughals
The Mughals prefered the Timur Ruby
so that was the most valuable stone for them
Because the Mughals preferred the brightly coloured stones
On the other hand the Hindu and Sikh kings preferred diamonds
You can consider this as a personal preference
But despite that
the Kohinoor was given a prestigious place on the Peacock Throne
by making it the eye of the Peacock
The diamond hadnt been named Kohinoor yet
Around 100 years later
under the Mughals Delhi had become one of the wealthiest cities in the world
more than 2 million people lived here
greater than the combined population of London and Paris
But by this point in time
the Mughal Empire had weakened
The wealth of Delhi attracted Persias Nadir Shah
In 1739 Nadir Shah invaded Delhi
and defeated Mohammed Shah
Mohammed Shah was the 15th Mughal emperor
the greatgrandson of Aurangzeb
Nadir Shah too many treasures from Delhi with him when he returned
700 elephants 4000 camels
and 12000 horses were needed
to carry the treasures
Among these treasures was the Kohinoor diamond as well
A common belief has it that
Nadir Shah had received a tip from an official working in the Mughal Empire
that Mohammed Shah had hidden the Kohinoor diamond in his turban
There used to be an old war custom of exchanging turbans
so Nadir Shah proposed to exchange turbans with Mohammed Shah
when the Kohinoor diamond fell to the ground
It shone so brightly under the light
that Nadir Shah uttered
It literally meant Mountain of Light
And thus this diamond was named
But Nadir Shahs financial official of the time
wrote a book Tarikhi Alamarayi Nadiri
The content of the book provided us with a written record
That the Kohinoor was attached to the head of the Peacock Throne
Nadir Shah took the Peacock Throne with him
and wore the Timur Ruby and Kohinoor diamond on his armband
The origin story of the name of this diamond
may not be true
The part that it was hidden in a turban
but it is true that
Nadir Shah had named this diamond Kohinoor
Because this book has the reference to the diamond as Kohinoor
For the next 70 years Kohinoor remained the part of present day Afghanistan
This is where the Curse of Kohinoor comes to play
I talked about it in the beginning of the video
The owner of the diamond would own the world
but all the misfortunes will fall on him
This saying is taken from the Hindu text written in 1306
as I told you before
it is believed to be the very first mention of the Kohinoor diamond
It is a superstition
but as you will see that it is true to some extent
Misfortune fell on Nadir Shah on 1747
When Nadir Shah was killed by his guard
His empire collapsed as a result
Ahmad Shah Durrani
also known as Ahmad Khan Abdali
Was a member of Nadir Shahs army
He became the founder of the new Afghan empire
And with it the new owner of the Kohinoor diamond
William Dalrymple and Anita Anands book tells us
that the grandson of Nadir Shah
Shahrukh Shah
had molten lead poured on his head
similar to what was shown in Game of Thrones
to find out where Kohinoor was hidden
You can call it the curse of Kohinoor or anything else
but there were a lot of infighting in the Durrani empire as well
Ahmads son Timur ran the empire adeptly
but later Ahmads grandsons
fought amongst each other for the throne
Timurs son the third ruler of the empire
Zaman Shah Durrani
was blinded with hot needles
His brother the fifth ruler was Shuja Shah Durrani
His wife had said that
if a strong man threw four pebbles in four directions
North South East and West
and then threw a fifth pebble into the air
and the space enclosed by the five pebbles
were filled with gold
the value of all the gold there would still not match Kohinoors value
Shuja Shah Durrani wore the Kohinoor on his bracelet
In 1809 he was dethroned
and he fled with the Kohinoor diamond to Lahore
There he took refuge from Maharaja Ranjith Singh
Ranjith Singh was the founder of the Sikh Empire
and in exchange for providing refuge to Durrani
he asked for the Kohinoor diamond
And so the Kohinoor diamond went to the Sikh empire in 1813
Even for Ranjith Singh Kohinoor held a lot of symbolic importance
The land usurped by the Durrani dynasty
was won back by him
He was known as the Lion of Lahore
or the SherePunjab
And he wore the Kohinoor on his bicep
In an armlet
Some years later East India Companys hold over India was getting stronger
when the British came to know about the death of Ranjith Singh in 1839
they also came to know of his plan
to give this diamond to some Hindu priests
The British newspapers of the time
were infuriated with this
One of the newspapers published
The richest the most costly gem in the known world
has been committed to the trust of a profane
idolatrous and mercenary priesthood
The British government ordered the East India Company
to keep an eye on the Kohinoor diamond
To continue tracking where it goes
and look for the opportunity to get it for the British treasury
The British had to wait for nearly a decade
After Ranjith Singhs death in 1839
the Punjabi throne was passed on to four rulers over the next four years
By 1843 there were only two people standing
One Ranjith Singhs wife Rani Jindan
and the other a fiveyearold child
Prince Duleep Singh
Finally when the second AngloSikh war ended in 1849
the East India Company ended the rule of the Punjab empire
By then Duleep Singh was about 10 years old
EIC made him sign a Treaty of Lahore
As per this treaty
the Kohinoor diamond was supposed to be handed over to the East India Company
Punjab was the last major state that hadnt been conquered by the British
After winning this war
the East India Company didnt want to leave any scope
to allow the Sikh Empire to sprout once again
And so they jailed Jindan
and the only other remaining family member
was shipped to London
and converted to Christianity
I told you this at the beginning of the video
When Duleep Singh was merely 15yearsold
he was sent to London in 1854
In July 1854
when Duleep Singhs portrait was being painted in the Buckingham Palace
Queen Victoria gave him an opportunity to see the Kohinoor once again
He held it in his hand
and it is said that the words he spoke were
During the last years of his life Duleep Singh
rebelled against England
he tried to return to India
but he was prevented by the British
He tried to get the help of the Germans
But unfortunately he remained unsuccessful
It is said that he had an unfortunate death
at 55 years old in Paris
His living conditions were quite bad by then
he was living in poverty
On the other hand Kohinoor became a special possession of Queen Victoria
the curse of Kohinoor
warning any man who owned it
also said that
Only a God or a woman can wear it with impunity
Without any adverse consequences
In 1851 in the Hyde Park of London
an exhibition was held
wherein the British people had the opportunity to see the Kohinoor
But the public reaction was quite unexpected
People were surprised to see empires fighting over a small piece of rock
People couldnt believe that it was the same Kohinoor diamond
for which people had killed one another
To them it simply looked like a glass piece
Not unlike any normal piece of glass
It was reported by the Times newspaper in June 1851
After the disappointing reaction of the public
Queen Victorias husband Prince Albert
commissioned the recutting and polishing of Kohinoor in 1852
So that light could be reflected better
and it could shine more
He wanted people to be mesmerised by looking at it
But due to this process
Kohinoor lost 40 of its weight
It used to be 186 carats
and after the recutting and polishing
it was left with 1056 carats
presently the dimensions of Kohinoor diamond are
Kohinoor is now about as big as a chickens egg
Moving on with our story
when the British got their hands on Kohinoor
they too were scared of the Curse of Kohinoor
So going forward the British Royal Family decided
that they wouldnt give the Kohinoor to a man
When the monarch would be male
the Queen Consort would be the one to wear the Kohinoor
And that whys over the next years
when the British throne was passed on
Kohinoor always went to the Queen
Eventually it became a part of the Crown Jewels
It was first put in Queen Alexandras crown
then in Queen Marys
and finally in 1937
it was embedded in the crown
worn by the mother of the present Queen of England
The Queen Mothers funeral was held in 2002
when the crown was last seen in public
Currently this crown and the Kohinoor
can be found in the Tower of Londons
Waterloo barracks
in the Jewel House inside it
They are kept there
Over the last 800 years of Kohinoors history
the British monarchy has been the owner of Kohinoor for the longest
Kohinoor has been with them for 173 years

Now lets return to the topic
Many Indians feel quite emotional towards the Kohinoor
Shashi Tharoors 2015 Oxford Union speech had become very famous
Indias share of the world economy
when Britain arrived on its shores
was 23
By the time the British left
it was down to below 4
India was already Britains biggest cash cow
the worlds biggest purchaser of British goods
and exports
His arguments were praised by Prime Minister Modi as well
He laid out the economic and prosperity potential lost by India
due to British colonialism
And Kohinoor is now a symbol of this British colonialism
The question is whether the Kohinoor diamond
was stolen by the British from India
or was it a gift?
That was given to them in exchange of the deal
1 year after Shashi Tharoors 2015 speech
in 2016 a petition was filed in the Supreme Court by an NGO
The petition stated that the government should get the Kohinoor back
That the Indian government should demand
that the British government return the diamond
But Ranjith Kumar the governments representative in court
said that the diamond was a part of the Lahore Treaty
neither has it been stolen nor taken forcefully
and to try to get it back would be futile
Later the Archaeological Survey of India said on behalf of the government
that they would try their best to get back the Kohinoor using friendly ways
It was said that the arguments by Mr Kumar
did not represent the views of the government
But legally speaking
there are no legal grounds for Kohinoors return to India
The only legal route present here
is the 1970 UNESCO Convention
The Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing
the Illicit Import Export and Transfer of
Ownership of Cultural Property
The cultural heritage of the country that was taken to another illegally
through unfair means
But there are two problems with this convention
First it cannot be applied retrospectively
The cultural heritage that was taken before 1970
does not have to be mandatorily returned
And the other thing is that
Cultural Heritage has been defined in Article 1 of the Convention
as a property which on religious or secular grounds
is specifically designated by each State
as being of importance for archaeology
prehistory history literature art or science
The second problem is that even if the  cultural heritage is returned
which country should get it?
The situation is quite complicated
because of the present borders drawn between the countries
are quite recent
The kingdoms which existed before this
during the monarchies
had dynamic borders which were redrawn very often
Today the sovereign territories of
India Afghanistan and Pakistan
exist only after their Independence
Before this there used to be kingdoms
Technically speaking
Kohinoor diamond has not been taken from the sovereign territories of
India Afghanistan or Pakistan
Because those territories were created only after a specific date
But the Kohinoor was taken before that from kingdoms
Another question here is
whom should Kohinoor be returned to?
In Afghanistan Talibans spokesperson said in 2000
that they want Kohinoor back in their country
In 2016 a petition was filed in Pakistans Lahore High Court
because the British had stolen the Kohinoor
from presentday Pakistan
Because the capital of the Sikh empire was Lahore
Anthropologist Richard Kurin says that logically
Kohinoor can be returned to several countries
Afghanistan Pakistan India and even Iran
can rightfully claim the ownership of this diamond
Because back then stealing and plundering used to be quite common
But back then none of these countries existed
Even though geographically their regions existed
It should be differentiated from other events
for example the cultural heritage stolen by the Nazis
where it can be clearly seen
the country the theft took place in
Because these countries existed already
Emotionally as well Richard Kurin says
we should let go of Kohinoor forever
So that its dark history is not repeated
and it is allowed to rest at its final resting place
What is your opinion?
Write in the comment section below
Should the government try to get Kohinoor back?
Or should we let it be there?
