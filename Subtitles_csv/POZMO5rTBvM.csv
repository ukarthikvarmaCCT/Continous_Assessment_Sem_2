They are among the most terrifying of Saurons beasts Great winged creatures
these hellhawks would become the steed of choice for the Nazgul Bearing their dark masters
they would bring terror from the skies
Today on Nerd of the Rings we cover the Fell Beasts of the Nazgul
While the Fell Beasts are mysterious creatures and we dont know their exact
origin we are given clues We know that like his master before him
Sauron clearly saw the value of being capable of aerial battle in addition to aerial travel
Where Morgoth would create the winged dragons that debut in the War of Wrath
Sauron brings about the fell beasts that would be revealed during the War of the Ring
After a journey that began in secrecy
the ringwraiths horses are killed when they are swept away by the River Bruinen Forced
to return to Mordor on foot Saurons servants turn to their more speedy and deadly steeds
The first appearance of a fell beast though we dont know it at the time is on the night of
February 23 when the fellowship is making its way down the Anduin river after their stay in Lorien
A dark shape like a cloud and yet not a cloud for it moved far more swiftly
came out of the blackness in the South and sped towards the Company blotting out all light as
it approached Soon it appeared as a great winged creature blacker than the pits in the night
Suddenly the great bow of Lrien sang Shrill went the arrow from the elvenstring Frodo looked up
Almost above him the winged shape swerved There was a harsh croaking scream
as it fell out of the air vanishing down into the gloom of the eastern shore The sky was
clean again There was a tumult of many voices far away cursing and wailing in the darkness
and then silence Neither shaft nor cry came again from the east that night
It is not until chapter 3 of the The Two Towers that we get a hint that Legolas had indeed shot
down the mount of a Nazgul and that these beasts were far greater than mere means of travel
UGLUK Whats happened to your precious Nazgl? Has he had another mount shot under him? Now
if youd brought him along that might have been usefulif these Nazgl are all they make out
Nazgl Nazgl said Grishnkh shivering and licking his lips
as if the word had a foul taste that he savoured painfully You speak of what is deep beyond the
reach of your muddy dreams Uglk he said Nazgl! Ah! All that they make out! One day
youll wish that you had not said that Ape! he snarled fiercely You ought to know that theyre
the apple of the Great Eye But the winged Nazgl not yet not yet He wont let them
show themselves across the Great River yet not too soon Theyre for the Warand other purposes
Two chapters later Gandalf would confirm to Legolas directly the victim of his shot and
that the Nazgul would no longer resort to mere horses in the War of the Ring
The Winged Messenger! cried Legolas I shot at him with the bow of Galadriel above Sarn Gebir
and I felled him from the sky He filled us all with fear What new terror is this?
One that you cannot slay with arrows
said Gandalf You only slew his steed It was a good deed but the Rider was soon horsed again
For he was a Nazgl one of the Nine who ride now upon winged steeds
Chronologically Frodo Sam and Gollum are next to experience
a nazgul on its fell steed as they pass through the Dead Marshes
Then Frodo and Sam staring at the sky saw it come a small cloud flying from the accursed
hills a black shadow loosed from Mordor a vast shape winged and ominous It scudded
across the moon and with a deadly cry went away westward outrunning the wind in its fell speed
They fell forward grovelling heedlessly on the cold earth But the shadow of horror wheeled and
returned passing lower now right above them sweeping the fenreek with its ghastly wings
And then it was gone flying back to Mordor with the speed of the wrath of Sauron
and behind it the wind roared away leaving the Dead Marshes bare and bleak
Frodo and Sam got up But Gollum lay on the ground as if he had been stunned They roused him
with difficulty and for some time he would not lift his face but knelt forward on his elbows
covering the back of his head with his large flat hands
Wraiths! he wailed Wraiths on wings!
The Precious is their master They see everything everything
Nothing can hide from them Curse the White Face! And they tell Him everything He sees He knows
Ach gollum gollum gollum!
Again they experience a winged Nazgul but this time it was on other business
Frodo Sam and Gollum had not gone far before they felt once more the fear that had fallen on
them when the winged shape swept over the marshes They halted cowering on the evilsmelling ground
but the menace passed high overhead going maybe on some swift errand from Baraddr
Gandalf and the three hunters would go on to assist the Rohirrim in the Battle of Helms Deep
and then come to Isengard to parley with Saruman However on their way back to Edoras they would
once again feel the dread of the Winged Nazgul While reading the book this comes before Sam and
Frodos moment we discover that this is actually the same Nazgul making his way to Isengard
At that moment a shadow fell over them The bright moonlight seemed to be suddenly cut off
Several of the Riders cried out and crouched holding their arms above their heads as if to
ward off a blow from above a blind fear and a deadly cold fell on them Cowering they looked
up A vast winged shape passed over the moon like a black cloud It wheeled and went north flying
at a speed greater than any wind of Middleearth The stars fainted before it It was gone
Gandalf would face off against what Beregond of Gondor calls
hellhawks as Faramir is making his escape back to Minas Tirith
But now the dark swooping shadows were aware of the newcomer One wheeled towards him
but he raised his hand and from it a shaft of white light stabbed upwards
The Nazgl gave a long wailing cry and swerved away and with that the four others wavered
and then rising in swift spirals they passed away eastward
vanishing into the lowering cloud above and down on the Pelennor it seemed for a while less dark
The fell beasts we meet in The Lord of the Rings have beaks and claws They are featherless and
have batlike wings it is hinted that their heads are somewhat birdlike The most physical
description we get of these winged monstrosities comes later in The Return of the King
The great shadow descended like a falling cloud And behold! it was a winged creature if bird
then greater than all other birds and it was naked and neither quill nor feather did it bear
and its vast pinions were as webs of hide between horned fingers and it stank
A creature of an older world maybe it was whose kind lingering in forgotten mountains
cold beneath the Moon outstayed their day and in hideous eyrie bred this last untimely brood apt
to evil And the Dark Lord took it and nursed it with fell meats until it grew beyond the
measure of all other things that fly and he gave it to his servant to be his steed
It is this dreadful description of the winged shadow that precedes Theodens
fateful encounter with the Lord of the Nazgul
And one aspect that comes up in many of these quotes is the stench of the Fell Beasts  a
trait that understandably wasnt communicated as strongly in the films as the fear they inspire
The Witch King of Angmar rides his foul steed into the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and shoots
Theodens horse Snowmane with a dart crushing the king It is in this moment that Eowyn defends
her dying uncle and with a great swing of her sword decapitates the winged terror of Mordor
Once again Frodo and Sam witness the flight of a Nazgul March 15 but this time it
was not seeking for the ring or on a mission of Saurons but delivering tidings to the Dark Lord
and then they saw a shape moving at a great speed out of the West
at first only a black speck against the glimmering strip above the
mountaintops but growing until it plunged like a bolt into the dark
canopy and passed high above them
As it went it sent out a long shrill cry the voice of a Nazgul but this
cry no longer held any terror for them it was a cry of woe and dismay
ill tidings for the Dark Tower The Lord of the Ringwraiths had met his doom
The Winged Terrors are unleashed once again at the Battle of the Black Gate
However the great eagles would come to the battle
bearing down upon the Nazgul In that moment a terrible call emanated from the Dark Tower for
Frodo had claimed the one ring for his own and Sauron was aware the ring was now at Mount Doom
The Winged Nazgul move with all speed to Orodruin however they are too late
The ring is destroyed when Gollum slips into the fiery depths of the mountain
and in the ensuing eruption the Nazgul and their steeds are destroyed Never to return
We know now what happened to these winged beasts but what of their origin? This will be a theory
video for another day but I want to hear what you think Were they some descendant of dragons?
Or perhaps eagles that were mutilated into foul beasts bound to the dark lord?
were some other dreadful creature entirely twisted by Sauron
into their final monstrous form Let me know what you think in the comments!
