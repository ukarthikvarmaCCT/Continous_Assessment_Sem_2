The people in this video take being lucky to the extreme
from finding a 250 million lottery ticket on the street
to winning the championship game

Thats extremely lucky
NASCAR crew dodges two cars
Dude I love NASCAR
Into the danger zone

Look at him
He jumped with a floor jack
Those things weigh like 60 pounds

through that guys phone and embarrass him and stuff
and thats pretty funny

Thats so cool
I watched a long video about this
He was in a submarine  Uhhuh
It sank to the bottom it had an air pocket
It was on the bottom of the ocean
He was living in an air pocket in pitch black for four days
He felt sharks swimming around him and everything
Oh my gosh
In freezing cold water dude
And they got him out?
Yeah they got him out
Lets high five for that guy
This is a state championship game
The team in black is currently up by three points
He misses  Oh thats a miss
Thats a big miss
Okay look
Half a second is left on the clock
Wait a minute Jimmy where hes standing at
approximately would be worth three points
No chance he makes it Jimmy
Wow thats sick
This is why Im scared of baseball
I got hit in the face with a ball like that one time
Look at that
Dude it literally went across his chest
Just catch it
What do you mean just catch it?
He tried  Just catch it
This is why I dont ice climb
This is like that Modern Warfare II mission
It kind of looks like he hit it
Hes only climbing with those two sheaths
And his feet have spikes on him
Thats the only other thing  Oh my God
No rope no nothing dude
If you lose your footing

Thats like a Minecraft sand trap
Oh my god
Look at that guy on the pole
Hes just like
This is the safest spot I know it
He bought a lottery ticket
a winning lottery ticket
but he left it at the store
And thankfully an honest cashier came to the rescue
You work at a gas station
someone buys a lottery ticket  Mmhmm
They leave it there  Mmhmm
You grab it
Next day you find out

You giving it back or you keeping it?
To the bank

Never let em know your next move
I was about to say
This clip has the title card of an inch away
And before we watch the clip
I just wanna say I dont understand
why thats in the Worlds luckiest clips
Because  That seems pretty far away
An inch is a ton of space
Some would say its almost a little too much
I mean he still hit that sign
Through that sign
