Hello friends!
Last month more than 30000 people gathered in Ladakh to protest
Watch these videos
It may not seem like a huge number
But here 30000 means
more than 10 of the population of this Union territory
Everyone was gathered at one place
to protest for their rights
On 6th March
when the discussions with the government did not yield any result
the famous educator innovator and activist
Sonam Wangchuk decided to go on an indefinite fast
Im going on an indefinite fast
until Ladakhs voice is heard
Until the government pays attention to Ladakh
A 21day fast
which can become a fast till deth
Think about it if in any state in our country
10 of the population takes to the streets protesting
will it not be a huge news?
But the way this news is being suppressed by the news channels
it is very shocking to see
We will talk about the demands of the protesters later in the video
but in the video I would also like to show you
that story isnt unique to Ladakh
This story is playing out in every corner of the country today
The political corporate mafia that is putting Ladakh in danger today
is the same mafia that destroyed the forests of Hasdeo
set fire to the hills of Manipur
and is bent on destroying Buxwaha
The same mafia that is causing Joshimath to sink
that caused the tunnel collapse in Uttarkashi
and put Lakshadweep in danger
If this mafia is not stopped
it will slowly devour the country like a termite
It will make it hollow from within
Lets understand this in todays video
Friends if you dont know Sonam Wangchuk
then it is important to tell you that
he is the person who inspired
the character of Rancho in the film 3 Idiots
The innovations made by Rancho in the film
Sonam Wangchuk made similar innovations and more in real life
In 2021 he built these environmentfriendly solar heated tents for the Indian Army
With these tents our soldiers
were able to stay comfortably even in the freezing cold of Ladakh
Apart from this Sonam Wangchuk
has also designed many carbon neutral solar buildings in Ladakh
He was the one to introduce the concept of Ice Stupas
To deal with the water shortage in Ladakh
he introduced this concept
of building these artificial glaciers
Throughout the years he has been awarded many awards for his innovations
Be it the Ramon Magsaysay Award
the Green Teacher Award
or an award by the UNESCO
So today when this Sonam Wangchuk
is sitting on an indefinite fast
it must be because of a serious problem
The problem is the democracy in Ladakh
the environment of Ladakh
and the rights of the people of Ladakh
The people of Ladakh have four main demands
First including Ladakh in the 6th Schedule of the Constitution
Second giving full statehood to Ladakh
Third electing 2 MPs from Ladakh
Currently theres only 1 MP is from Ladakh in the Lok Sabha
and 0 MPs in the Rajya Sabha
And fourth establishing a Public Service Commission to provide secure jobs in Ladakh
Lets understand each of them in detail
First what is this 6th Schedule?
This is the part of the Constitution
that protects the tribal population in the country
According to this in tribal areas
to promote democracy the tribal people
can form their own Autonomous District Councils
and Autonomous Regional Councils
Also known as ADCs and ARCs
They are basically elected bodies
that have the power to administer tribal areas
So that on a local level the tribal people
make their rules about their land forest and sociocultural customs
So that people from outside cannot exploit their land and resources
Today this 6th Schedule is applicable
in the tribal areas of Assam Meghalaya Tripura and Mizoram
Now you might think since there are no forests in Ladakh
why are the people of Ladakh demanding it?
There are three main reasons for this
First it is true that there arent forests in Ladakh
but every area has its natural biodiversity
And Sonam Wangchuk has explained this many times
that the area of Ladakh
is very vulnerable considering climate change
The mountains are facing the wrath of nature
in the face of climate change
If the resources are allowed to be exploited in this area
it will be largely dangerous for Ladakh
The frequency of natural disasters flash floods and landslides will increase
Second the majority population of Ladakh
falls in the Scheduled Tribes category
According to NCST
668 of the population of Leh is Scheduled Tribe
83 in Kargil
and in some areas it is as high as 99
The third and the biggest reason
the 6th Schedule will give the people of Ladakh their democratic rights
Today what do the people of Ladakh have in terms of democracy?
Think about it yourself
Since the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019
Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir were divided into a separate Union Territories
People didnt have any issues with the abrogation of Article 370
rather their issues are with the actions of the government after the abrogation
JK used to be a full state
After 2019 it was downgraded
and divided into two separate Union Territories
This is what JKs former Governor Satyapal Malik had said
More than the abrogation of Article 370
they feel bad about this
Absolutely so why did you do this?
I didnt play any part in this
Had they asked I would have warned them against it
JKs Union Territory did get its Legislative Assembly
But Ladakh wasnt given that right
Before 2019 when JK used to be a full state
there were 4 MLAs from Ladakh
But today this number has come down to zero
Delhi is also a Union Territory
but there exists a state level government
You can vote for them you can elect them
Now its a different issue that
the Central Government has tried
its best to take away powers from the Delhi Government
over the last few years
But Ladakh wasnt given this right at all
There are no offices at the state level
that you can elect by voting
At the next level
people of Ladakh can vote for the Lok Sabha elections only
but even there
they have been given only 1 MP
This is the reason behind all these demands
On a local level they want to be included in the 6th Schedule
so that they can elect their ADCs and ARCs
and can protect their land
On a state level they want full statehood
But if that isnt possible
they want at least a Legislative Assembly
so that they can elect their government
And on a central level
they want to have 2 MPs
Otherwise this is only a shell of democracy?
Friends the most interesting thing is that
it doesnt matter whether
you agree with my reasoning or not
Because 4 years ago
BJP was the one to demand
that Ladakh be included in the 6th Schedule
What could be the reason
that BJP doesnt want to fulfil this demand now?
Its an interesting reason
and quite predictable
if you understand BJPs politics
I will talk about this reason in a while
but before that if you want to understand the Indian Constitution properly
then I would like to recommend this audiobook on Kuku FM
Bhartiya Samvidhan Ankahi Kahani
It explains in detail how our countrys great Constitution was actually drafted
The history behind it

Now lets get back to the topic
In fact not only a demand
right at the top of BJPs manifesto
they mentioned including Ladakh in the 6th Schedule
You can read what theyve clearly written in their manifesto
I have shown this earlier
today I will show it again
in 2019 during the Lok Sabha elections
in the third bullet point of you manifesto
you had promised to safeguard Ladakh in the 6th Schedule
September 2019 was the first time that
the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes had recommended
the inclusion of Ladakh in the 6th Schedule
But the government did not take any action
In August 2020 the people of Ladakh
put their demands in front of the government for the first time
In September 2020
the first mass protest took place in Ladakh regarding this
In 2020 the Autonomous Hill District Council was to be elected in Ladakh
And before the elections Home Minister Amit Shah promised that
within 15 days of the election
they would fulfil these demands
After this the protests were called off
and BJP won the elections with 15 seats
But after that no action was taken
During December 2021 and November 2022 there were two more protests
For a while there were discussions with the government
but despite writing in on the manifesto
the government kept refusing to give in to their demand
This is the reason for this indefinite fast today
It didnt escalate all of a sudden
As you can see over the last few years
people have been raising their demands repeatedly
But the biggest question here is
What is Modi governments problem
with fulfilling this demand?
Adding the people of Ladakh to the 6th Schedule
will not bring the nation crumbling down
Its a simple demand
And there wont be any backlash for the Modi government or BJP if they do this
After all they were the ones to include this in their manifesto
What could be the reason behind this refusal?
I would like you to read a line about the functions of ADCs
Look at the screen
The district and regional councils
administer the areas under their jurisdiction
They can make laws on certain specified matters
like land forests canal water shifting cultivation
Did you notice it?
Lands Forests
This means that if Ladakh is added to the 6th Schedule
then the Modi government wont have power
over the Ladakhs land
This means that Ladakhs land and forests
cannot be sold be PM Modi to his friend
They wanted every valley here
to be mined and have industries set up
but Ladakhs people are wary of this
Sonam Wangchuk and Ladakhs people dont want
their lands to be opened up for corporate exploitation
Doing this will not mean taking away the rights of the people living there
but it will also be very dangerous for our countrys environment
Ladakh is a beautiful and ecologically sensitive part of our country
The mountains and valleys here are so unique that
you cant find such features anywhere else in the world
The worlds rarest and most endangered animal species are found here
Like the snow leopards or the Tibetan antelopes
The water of the lakes here is so crystal clear
you wont even believe that
such clarity can be found anywhere
And if you have ever been to Ladakh
then you must know how innocent and purehearted these people are
Their culture and tradition
these monasteries and festivals
are so amazing that
people from all over the world come to see them
I believe that it is every Indians duty
to protect the environment and cultural diversity of a place like Ladakh
Places like these are like precious gems in our country
But the way our government is treating these precious gems today
tells you a lot about the governments intention
How long has it been since Manipur is on fire?
Its in a state of civil war
and PM Modi is not willing to even visit that state
And the reason for Manipurs terrible situation
is corporate exploitation
I explained it in this video
Theres deforestation of the Hasdeo jungle in Chhattisgarh
People made countless reels to protect the forest
But the government opened it up for mining
Who is benefiting from this?
The people?
Or Prime Ministers friends at the top?
This story isnt about Ladakh Manipur or Hasdeo only
On a large scale they are trying to
sell the forests of the country
To sell our mountains
and to sell our land
And the benefit from the corporate exploitation
goes to a select few at the top of hierarchy
If you still cant see the connection

Youll understand this funda thoroughly
Thank you very much!
