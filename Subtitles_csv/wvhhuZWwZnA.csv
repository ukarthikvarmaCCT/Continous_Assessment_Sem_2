Hello friends!
6th January 2004
Dubais sandy soil started being dug
to build the tallest building in the world
Around the end of 2004
worlds tallest building was Taipei 101
Located in Taiwan this building was a little over 500m tall
But the goal they set out to achieve in Dubai
was unimaginable and recordbreaking
They wanted a building so tall
that not only would it be the tallest building in the world
but also be 62 taller than the secondtallest building
The difference between the tallest and second tallest
would discourage anyone attempting to break its record
Before Burj Khalifa the previous worlds tallest buildings
were about 510 taller than their predecessor
At most 19 taller
But here they were aiming to build it 829m tall
A difference of 62
It took about 55 years to construct this building
and on 1st October 2009
the construction of the Burj al Khalifa ended
and this building left the world astounded
After the success of Burj Khalifa several countries announced that
theyll build even taller buildings
Many attempted it
But till now all plans have flopped
It has been more than 13 years
and till now the record set by Burj Khalifa remains unbeaten
Why is it so difficult to beat this record?
And practically speaking
how tall can the buildings built by humans be?
Come in this video lets try to understand this
When the Burj in Dubai is complete
it will be the tallest structure
that mankind has ever built on the face of the planet
Until someone builds an even bigger one
This is the story of the tallest tower
mankind has ever built
Hald a mile high
Friends for about 4000 years
the tallest structure built by humans was
It was built around 2500 BC
as a tomb for the Pharaoh Khufu
Its height is 145m
This record was broken only after the 1300s
when a cathedral was built in England
that was 160m tall
For the next 500 years this record was beaten by a series of churches
until the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889
But then Eiffel Tower isnt precisely a building
Its not a building in which people can stay or work in
In terms of proper buildings
this building by Chicago Home Insurance built in 1884
is known as the worlds first skyscraper
This was a building built for humans
Where people went to work it was used as an office space
Before this the previous tall structures
were either built for monarchs or for Gods
This was a major turning point in human history
Though this building was only 55m tall
Shorter than the Great Pyramid of Giza
But only after this did we get the innovation and technology
that we could build habitable skyscrapers
When the competition to build tall buildings began
it was limited to New York and Chicago
Because America was the worlds largest and most productive economy
till the end of the 19th century
And these 2 cities were central to the most economic boom
Many people wanted to live in these cities
Big companies wanted big office spaces
and to accommodate people better in the city
these skyscrapers had to be built
Some honourable mentions here
New Yorks Empire State Building
It remained the worlds tallest building from 1931 to 1971
It held the record for 40 years
And in the modern context
it held the record for the longest time
It was beaten in 1971
by another building in New York
the World Trade Centre at 417m
9 taller than Empire State Buildings 381m
In 1998 the competition spread out of America
and shifted towards Asia
When the Petronas Towers were built in Kuala Lumpur
at the height of 452m
They held the status of the worlds tallest building till 2004
after which it was beaten by Taipei 101
And in 2009 with the biggest margin
Burj Khalifa beat all of them
From 510m to 829m
Initially when Burj Khalifa was being planned
its initial proposed height was around 550m
During planning they kept on increasing the height until it was as tall as we know
At that time the brief of the tower was to
design a tower which was 550m
Which was then slightly taller
than the world record holder at that time
which was Taipei 101
We learned as we got into the project
that we could go higher
And there was a desire to go higher
And not only break the record by a little bit
but we could break it by a big margin
The reason was that in the downtown area of Dubai
this building would be the centrepiece attraction
Before the 1990s Dubai was basically
a village for fishing and pearl diving
That had discovered oil recently
But by the late 1990s and the early 2000s
the leaders in Dubai wanted
to diversify their economy
To move beyond the dependence on oil
They wanted to make Dubai an international tourism hub
To grab international attention and  to bring foreign investment
they had to do something to surprise the world
Friends Burj Khalifa is so tall
that if you jump out from its top
it will take you 13 seconds to fall to the ground
Without any air resistance
But if you account for the air resistance
then to fall to the ground from the very top
it might take you up to 20 seconds
Burj Khalifa is so tall that if you
watch the sunset from the ground
and then take the lift to its top
you can watch the sunset again
It cost 15 billion to build this
With more than 12000 workers
with more than 100 distinct nationalities
and spend 22 million manhours
But obviously the purpose of building it
turned out to be quite successful
Today not only has Dubai become an international hub for tourism
but also an economic hub
A large number of companies want to have their office in Dubai
People were to live in Dubai
Want to buy property there
And the downtown area where this Burj Khalifa was built
property prices have skyrocketed so much
that this 15 billion was easily recovered
The question arises what is so special about the Burj Khalifa
that makes it so difficult to beat it?
And if someone tries to build a taller building
realistically how tall can we build?
To understand this we need to first understand
the problems that are encountered while building such tall buildings
When such a tall building is built
it needs to support its weight
At those heights the winds are quite strong
so it needs to be ensured that theres no damage due to the winds
And the Burj Khalifa overcame these challenges
due to its innovative design
If you look at the design from the top
its in a Y shape
Similar to a tripod this building has three wings
Supported by a hexagonal core at the centre of the building
This structural system is known as the Buttressed Core
This was invented by Burj Khalifas structural engineer Bill Baker
This structural system was used for the first time
in South Koreas Tower Palace 3
With the height of 264m
After its success the architects realised that
using this system can help build taller buildings
And only with its help
Burj Khalifa could be so tall
So tall that the secondtallest building was 300m shorter
And Burj Khalifa was only the second building in the world
to use this Buttressed core system
With the help of this system
the impact of the strong winds that blow can be reduced
Compare this to the new residential building in New York
that have been built very tall
and fall under the category of Super Tall
but without using the Buttressed Core system
What needs to be done in those buildings?
To be safe from the winds a few floors must be left empty
So that the winds could pass through
Such as this 432 Park Avenue building
Apart from this Burj Khalifas foundation
has 192 concrete and steel columns under it
They extend to 50m into the ground
Similarly the building above ground needed concrete too
Concrete had to be delivered to the very top
To do this the worlds largest concrete pumps were built
so that Burj Khalifa could be built
The exterior of the building uses more than 100000m glass
as you can see in the photos
But an even more surprising fact is that
the exterior of the Burj Khalifa
forms the worlds largest LED screen
Thats right!
Worlds Biggest LED Screen
This is why you can watch light shows on Burj Khalifa
You can see colourful designs and patterns
and even movie trailers
Recently before the release of the film Pathaan
Shah Rukh Khan was in front of the Burj Khalifa
when the trailer of Pathaan was being shown on Burj Khalifa
How can this be possible?
The entire movie trailer being shown on a building
You might think that this is a projection
That the trailer was being projected onto the building by a projector
It wasnt
There are LED lights on the building
Such as the tiny LED lights on your computer screens and TV
There are 12 million LED lights on this building in total
From up close the LED lights look like this
Each light is quite large
But if you see these 12 million LED lights from afar
itll feel as if you are watching a TV screen
It enables videos of any length to be played on this building
And you might be wondering that when videos are being played
wont it create problems for the people inside the Burj Khalifa?
Wouldnt they see films playing on the windows or these lights?
No they wont
Next time when you visit the Burj Khalifa during the light show
look closely and youll notice that these lights
arent spread out all over the building
They are installed only on the frames
This is sufficient to display videos that  can be enjoyed by an audience at a distance
Friends buildings this tall have another problem
Suppose you are on the 160th floor of the Burj Khalifa
and a fire breaks out in the building
Will you climb down the stairs for 160 floors?
For such scenarios
in cases of emergency
after every 25 floors
there are pressurised and airconditioned refuge areas
Additionally staircases have been built with fireproof concrete
to limit the spread of fire
Friends now lets see the buildings that can
be taller than the Burj Khalifa in future
Here it is interesting to note that
over the last 12 years
even though no building could beat the Burj Khalifa
of the 20 tallest buildings currently
17 have been built after the Burj Khalifa
Such as the Merdeka 118 at 679m
Under construction in Kuala Lumpur
It will be officially inaugurated in mid2023
But it has already become the secondtallest building in the world
Though its a commendable effort
but 679m is still far from 829m
But several buildings have been planned
to be taller than the Burj Khalifa
Of which at least 2 of the buildings
are already under construction
The first is the Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia
If it is constructed as planned
it will be the first building to exceed the height of 1km
Its design is quite similar to the Burj Khalifa
because both buildings have the same architect
Once again Adrian Smith followed the Yshaped design
to bring in structural integrity
Once again the purpose for building this
is to diversify Saudi Arabias economy
so that it doesnt need to rely on oil only
Similar to the Burj Khalifa
this building would be used to build a new district
Jeddah Economic City
The construction of this building began in 2013
And about 14th of the tower was constructed
but unfortunately
in early 2018 the construction was halted
Since then the construction hasnt restarted
The thing is between 20172019
there was an anticorruption purge in Saudi Arabia
and the major investors investing in this project were arrested
And then the Covid19 pandemic hit
And the delay still continues
Publicly no one knows when the construction will restart
but if it is restarted this is the only building that can break Burj Khalifas record
The second project that has a high potential
is in Dubai
the Dubai Creek Tower
This Creek Tower designed by a Spanish architect
will be an observation tower in Dubai
It was planned around 20162018
and the foundation has been laid already
but the construction is stopped here as well
Originally it was planned to be inaugurated during the 2020 Expo
but it couldnt happen
The exact height of this tower
has not been revealed yet
but it is believed to be between 838m1300m
This tower may beat the Jeddah Tower in terms of height
but this tower will not fit into the tallest building category
Because as per the plans there will be no residential or commercial spaces here
This is being planned as a simple observation deck
Such as the Eiffel Tower
But the construction is halted here as well
And we do not know when and if it will restart
So if not these two which buildings
can beat the Burj Khalifa in future?
This question takes an imaginary turn here
Because the rest of the planned projects
have been planned and announced
but work on them hasnt started yet
Such as the Mubarak AlKabir Tower planned in Kuwait
Proposed in 2007
it was supposed to be 1001m tall
Its overall design was quite similar to that of the Burj Khalifa
but construction has not begun on it
So no one can estimate when it will be built
It is only a proposed plan now
If this sounds like an amazing plan
an even more astounding plan is
the Sky Mile Tower in Tokyo
A 17km tall building
For 500000 people to live
Look at the photos of this proposed building
Its overall shape is similar to Burj Khalifas
But if such a tall tower has to be built
it will be very challenging to control the winds
This is why there are these big gaps in the proposed design
so that the winds can flow through the building
These are proper vertical slots
and this project is included in a visionary megacity project
Known as the Next Tokyo
The Japanese government will try to build a Next Tokyo near Tokyo
Till now the plan is entirely theoretical
construction hasnt begun
But if it does begin it is estimated that
it will be completed by 2045
Overall theres little chance that even in the next 25 years there will be a building
that can beat the design of Burj Khalifa
The innovative design that made it possible for Burj Khalifa to be so tall
Even in the past 10 years
there were several projects for buildings taller than 800m
that were planned and then later cancelled
Such as in 2012 in Azerbaijan
a 1km tall building was planned
It was later cancelled
In 2013 China planned to build an 838m tall Sky City Scraper
due to environmental concerns this didnt receive government approval
this project was cancelled in 2016
The plans beyond Tokyos Sky Mile Tower
plans for taller buildings
are so imaginary that they belong to the sciencefiction category
Such as the plan for Tokyos XSeed 4000 building
A visionary project of building such a tall structure in Tokyo
A 4km tall building
Taller than Mount Fuji
With 1 million people living in it
It will look like this
Like a mountain
This was planned in 1995
but this is only a plan no work has been done on this
Another such plan is to build a Space Elevator
A cabled structured so tall that
it will take you to space
to ease transport between Earth and space
This is a theoretical concept that can be discussed in a separate video
and even so it wont fit into the building category
So theres no use discussing this in this video
The question remains practically
how tall can we build?
The structural engineer of Burj Khalifa Bill Baker claims
that if we use a modified version of the Buttressed Core
we can possibly build a building with a height of more than 2 miles
He says its possible to build a building taller than 3 km
He even claims that theoretically we can build a building taller than Mount Everest
But practically the problem would be
the taller the building gets
the more weight you put on the floors at the bottom
The force on the lower levels of the building
and the force of the strong winds at the top of the building
will be the two major challenges in building the tallest building possible
We can definitely use innovative design engineering and construction techniques
but what will happen if your material gives up?
As of now the materials that we know of
such as concrete steel aluminium
all have a limit
If we want to exceed these limits
we will need to invent such materials
that are lighter and more durable than these
A promising material that is said to be
is Carbon Fibre
Lightweight fibres made of carbon
woven like a mesh
It is stronger and lighter than steel
and perhaps it will enable us to build taller buildings
But before these complex engineering problems
there will be the problem of the human body
As buildings cross the mark of 15km3km
the altitude will be so high
that there will be differences in the air pressure
If youve gone to Leh Ladakh you wouldve noticed
how for the first couple of days there you suffer nausea and dizziness
because your body needs to acclimatise
due to the lower oxygen levels at the height
When you climb a mountain this can happen slowly
but if we built such a tall building
thats 2 km tall
when you take the elevator to instantly go from the ground floor to the top
your body will face the same problems unless
the air pressure is controlled inside the building
First of all this will be extremely expensive
and secondly it will mean that
balconies cannot be constructed on higher floors
And even if you made them no one would be allowed to go there
These things will need to be kept in mind
And even before the human bodys problems
is the socioeconomic limitaions
The biggest problem why such buildings arent built
Theres no guarantee that each building will be as successful as Burj Khalifa
that there will be such levels of economic boom around it
Investors will need to spend thousands of millions
to fund such buildings
Funding such buildings would mean extremely high risks
How many people would want to fund it?
Additionally this will require the support of the local government
but many governments will not support these
Because in most countries funds could be better utilised
In developing countries like India
if the government invests all its funds in such projects
to build the tallest building possible
it will be a huge wastage
This is why even in China
recently the Chinese government passed a law that
that they will not allow any building to be built taller than 500m
Any building being built taller than that would be simply for vanity
Practically it is a wastage of money
The energy consumption of such a building would be very high
and public funds will be wasted
And since there was no need they banned it
According to the laws of the Chinese government
in cities with up to 3 million people
the height limit for the skyscrapers has been set at 250m
Friends it is really important to pay attention to one thing here
there are very few cities all around the world
where the socioeconomic factors would allow
the worlds tallest building being built there
About 100 years ago these cities were New York and Chicago
That witnessed an economic boom
Hordes of people were moving in
There was a demand to build more homes and offices in a limited space
and so skyscrapers were born there
In the 21st century this was seen to some extent in Chinese and Taiwanese cities
thats why you see so many skyscrapers in those cities
but they arent so tall that they couldnt be profitable
And then there were the Middle Eastern countries
such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia
where the government wants to reduce oil dependence
and the government has a lot of money from oil
So it was possible to do this in such places to a large extent
Friends this is the reason why for now and for the foreseeable future at least
Burj Khalifa will remain the Worlds Tallest Building
