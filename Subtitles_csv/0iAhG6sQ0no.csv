Hello friends!
On 4th January 2024
on his social media handles  Prime Minister Modi
posted some pictures from Lakshadweep
Although there was no  mention of Maldives in these pictures
some politicians in the Maldivian government
reacted to these pictures in a way
that led to years of friendship  between the two countries
being in danger today
In a few days the situation becomes so serious that
BoycottMaldives started trending on social media
The 3 ministers of the Maldivian government
who caused the controversy are
Mariyam Shiuna
Malsha Shareef and
Abdullah Mahzoom Majid
Their comments on India and the Indian Prime Minister
look to be born out of insecurity
They believed that PM Modis agenda
was to make Lakshadweep and Maldives compete
But these comments included some personal attacks too
On Twitter Mariyam called PM Modi  a puppet of Israel
Her colleagues said that these photos from Lakshadweep
aimed at challenging the tourism industry in the Maldives
And Mahzoom Majid stereotyped Indians
and made hateful comments against India
Sharing photos of open urination he said that
it is a part of Indian culture
These led to an outright conflict on social media
When the Indians started posting that they
are cancelling their flight and hotel bookings
the Maldivian government understood the seriousness
and the Maldivian Foreign Ministry stated that
the opinions expressed by the ministers
were their personal opinions and
did not represent the views of the Maldivian government
Later the government suspended these 3 ministers
But the point isnt about  Maldives versus Lakshadweep only
Not just about this social media war
The whole controversy was driven by hateful politics
A geopolitical agenda which led to all of this
Lets understand it in todays video
One thing you all would know is that
Maldives is a small country
The total population of this country  is only around 500000 people
This country is made up of numerous islands
In fact there are more than 1000 islands
But out of these 1000 islands
only about 200 are inhabited
Where humans live
And out of these 200
more than 150 islands are resort islands
They have been sold to private companies
And those companies have their private resorts on it
Obviously the country depends heavily on tourism
28 of Maldives GDP depends on tourism
And 90 of the tax revenue for the government
comes from import duties and tourismrelated taxes
And an interesting fact is that
India is the number one country
based on the number of tourists visiting Maldives
In 2023 more than 200000 Indian tourists went to Maldives
In total approx 175 million tourists  went to Maldives this year
So you can imagine a country with a population of 500000
hosting more than 17 million tourists in a year
But the relationship between India and Maldives
is much deeper than that of tourism
For years India and Maldives have been strategic allies
and there has been military cooperation between the two too
India has played a special role in initiatives like SAGAR
SAGAR stands for
Security and Growth for All in the Region
Around 2008 India launched its Neighbourhood First Policy
and improved relations with Sri Lanka Maldives
Nepal Afghanistan Bangladesh
Pakistan and Myanmar
About 77 Indian military officers and soldiers
are present on the Maldives islands
additionally two Dhruv Advanced Light Helicopters
were donated by India to the Maldives in 2010 and 2015
There are many reasons behind this  military presence and helicopter donation
Such as helping during natural calamities
conducting search and rescue operations
airlifting medical patients between islands
But apart from this Indias warships patrol the
exclusive economic zone of the Maldives too
This is the sea area surrounding Maldives
where illegal activity is prevented
Basically to prevent terrorism
Maldives had requested India to do this
In 2009 when the Maldivian government
were concerned about potential  terrorist attacks in their country
they had asked India for help
because they did not have the capabilities  in terms of military assets and surveillance
But this help and Indias military presence
has become a major issue of controversy  in Maldives internal politics for the last few years
Some political parties in Maldives completely oppose this
and want India to withdraw its military
In fact Maldives current President Mohamed Muizzu
and his political party Peoples National Congress
used this issue during their election campaign
and came to power
The issue of India Out
To understand this better
we have to take a look at Maldives internal politics
The thing is the country was  under dictatorship for 30 years
It was only in 2008
that a new constitution was adopted
and a multiparty democracy system  was established in their country
The elections that were conducted in 2008
was won by the Maldivian  Democratic Party or MDP in short
and their new President was Mohamed Nasheed
He was a successful president for the first 4 years of his term
He spread awareness on climate change issues
pledged to make Maldives carbon neutral
and his foreign policy was India First
During his term India and Maldives became close allies
And as I said in 2009 on his request
India donated military equipment to Maldives
But in 2012 a political crisis broke out in Maldives
And the next year in 2013  when elections took place
a new party came to power
The Progressive Party of Maldives or PPM
The President was Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom
And with the change in the governing party
the foreign policy of the country also changed
This new party opposed India
In 2016 their new government stated that
India can take back the  2 helicopters that were gifted to them
After distancing themselves from India
Yameens government got closer to China
Chinese companies were given contracts for
major infrastructure projects in the Maldivian islands
And in the meantime  Maldives became a part of
Chinas Belt and Road Initiative
Under this initiative China wants to spend money
on large infrastructure projects
in different countries across the world
by building roads railways and ports
to increase its influence in Asia Africa and Europe
Most of the loan terms of Chinese contracts
were quite unsustainable
Because of this many countries fall into Chinas debt trap
During this time Maldives borrowed  15 Billion from China
Friends here Id like to say that
if you couldnt understand any part in my video
you can use ChatGPT as an assistant
What is Chinas Belt and Road Initiative?
You can simply ask this
It can explain in simple terms why many countries are deep in debt
And not only in English ChatGPT can
answer your questions in Hindi or Hinglish too
Similarly for many such tasks
ChatGPT is a useful software
This is why I made a 45hourlong  course to master ChatGPT
This course is in Hindi with English subtitles
In it you can learn how ChatGPT
can help students employees and business owners
to increase their productivity and efficiency
Next week a new 1hour long bonus  content will be added to the course

Now lets get back to the topic
Because of this government
relations between India and Maldives got weaker
and Indias strategic position in this area starts weakening
After this the next election was in 2018
once again the governing party changed
and so did the foreign policy of the country
In 2018 Ibrahim Mohamed Solih from MDP
became the President
And the first thing he did was
the Indian helicopters that Yameen wanted to send back
Solih extended the contract of those Indian helicopters
He wanted to keep those helicopters in Maldives
Once again they adopted India First strategy
Thereafter India helps the Maldivian government
India provides billions of dollars to Maldives
so that they could repay the loan
taken by the previous government
Even during the Covid pandemic
India provided vaccines in Maldives
One thing to note here is that
even when Maldives wasnt a democracy
during the 30year dictatorship
IndiaMaldives relations were still strong
Like in 1995 India built
Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Maldives
It is still the largest hospital in Maldives
Back to 2020
this new MDP government
was extremely enthusiastic about  the India First sentiment
Many bilateral agreements were signed
between India and Maldives during this time
India granted 500 million for maritime connectivity
A Line of Credit of 800 million  was given by ExportImport Bank of India
Due to this India Firsts proactive approach
an undercurrent was spreading across the country
The sentiment of India Out
The politicians in the opposition had a
negative outlook towards the alliance between
the Indian government and the Maldivian government
By 2021 many journalists had written articles about it
numerous posts had been made on social media
which were openly criticising India
and in many ways degrading India
Politicians were also giving hateful speeches
to end Indias presence from their islands
Seeing all this the Indian High Commission in Maldives
wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Maldives
stating that the articles and social media posts
were attacking Indian dignity
They asked the ministry to do something about them
This letter was leaked to Maldives media
On 2nd July 2021 the MDP government
officially apologises to India
And expresses concern that
some people who are spreading hatred against India
on Maldivian media and social media
Acknowledging it as wrong
Here a local news publication DRS was mentioned
with their cofounder Ahmed Azaan
Specifically pointing out that
they are the people spreading AntiIndia hate
Regarding India Out slogans Ahmed Azaan gave a statement
that the campaign does not mean that they  want to expel the Indians from Maldives
They do want Indians to be safe in their country
And that the India Out movement means that
they want to expel the Indian military from their country
And that the people using the India Out campaign
to threaten the Indians
and to attack Indians
are in the wrong
He called it an issuebased movement
So the point is
if this is an issuebased movement
then what are their issues?
The opposition politicians claim that
the agreements entered into by the MDP government with India
are very confidential
and their details are not revealed to the public
The then Vice President of their opposition party PPM
Mohd Shareef said that
if the details of the agreement
are not presented to the country
it is a violation of democracy
The government should not hide the details  by citing the excuse of national security
He used the example of the Harbour project
on the Uthura Thila Falhu Island in Maldives
A joint defence action plan was signed
between India and Maldives in February 2021
where Indias job was to develop and
maintain the harbour of this coast guard
Leaked documents suggest that
according to this agreement
the Indian military could stay here for decades
and they would have the exclusive rights to this facility
Many Maldivian citizens were  genuinely upset after hearing this
Even those who were not  supporting the India Out campaign
started supporting the opposition
And because of this when the next  elections were conducted in 2023
the governing party changed again
and the PPM party that was the opposition
came back into power
This time this PPM party
formed an alliance with PNC party to be in power
And the latest President of Maldives
Mohamed Muizzu
was the candidate of this rightwing party PNC
This happened on 30th September 2023
This political party which focused on the  India Out issue during their election campaign
is in power today
It is also worth noting that
had the previous MDP government been more transparent
and had not kept the agreements so confidential
then perhaps the India Out sentiment
would not have gained so much traction
And perhaps they could have remained in power
But now since this PPM party came into power
they took this India Out issue  even more seriously than last time
Their new president Mohamed Muizzu
openly stated four days after winning the election
that Indian forces in Maldives
will have to leave the country
On 17th November 2023  he became the President officially
and only a week later
on 23rd November
he met Indian Union Minister Kiren Rijiju
He repeated the same points in the meeting
that India withdraw its military personnel from Maldives
And it was only a month and a half later
that the Muizzus ministers
openly started insulting PM Modi and India
on public platform
When this happened the exPresidents of Maldives
and the MDP party
obviously stood up in favour of India
Mohamed Nasheed and Ibrahim Mohamed Solih
both condemned this hateful language against India
Now that you know these you can understand
that it was never about Lakshadweep
This was entirely about Maldives internal politics
This India Out sentiment
is a way for some Maldivian politicians
to incite their citizens
and to score more votes with their hateful speeches
In 2021 when the MDP government was in power  and India Out slogans were raised
then one of the MDP ministers Ali Azim had said that
this antiIndia movement was
happening because some people
enjoy making hateful speeches
Today this is a great example of how
hateful politics can be harmful to a country
You will find such politicians not only in Maldives
but in every country in the world
They either spread hatred against a community
against a religion
or against another country
Whats unfortunate is that
many people get misled by such  hateful speeches and the fear they create
If we look at the foreign policy of the new Maldivian government
it is once again leaning towards China
Maybe its just a coincidence that
this entire controversy started just a day before
the Maldivian Presidents visit to China
His trip to China was from 8th to 12th January
The Chinese statesponsored media
praised this situation stating that
it demonstrates that Muizzu is treating  India with a normal mindset
and steering the relationship between Maldives and India
to a normal statestate relationship
It is also historic that
Muizzu chose China for his first foreign trip
All the Maldivian presidents before him
came to India on their first foreign trip
Just two days ago on 10th January
after this controversy began
President Muizzu extended an  invitation to Chinese tourists
to visit Maldives
Since Indians started boycotting the country
he is openly inviting Chinese tourists to his country
So the entire issue here  is about Maldives internal politics
The parties in favour of China
versus the parties in favour of India
This also reveals that
if the governing party changes once again in Maldives in 45 years
and the proIndia party comes to power
then Indias stance towards Maldives can change again
The boycott Maldives slogans that are trending now
can turn into Go to Maldives slogans
after a few years
But regardless of what happens in Maldives politics
we can always promote Indian tourism
One thing that we need to be cautious about is that
while promoting local tourism
the local biodiversity and the local  population should also be cared for
Tourism should not be at the cost of  environment and the livelihoods of the locals

in which I have talked about how  countries all over the world
promote the weapons industry
And why the United Nations fails in such cases
