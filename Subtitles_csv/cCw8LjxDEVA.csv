Hello friends!
Did you hear the news?
Im going to make a wildcard entry in Bigg Boss!
So many media houses have published this news
India TV India Times
ABP News India Today
Zoom TV Pinkvilla Economic Times
I mean look at this headline
Popular YouTuber Dhruv Rathee
set to make a wildcard entry
in Bigg Boss OTT 2
One website has confirmed this
Dhruv Rathee Bigg Boss OTT Entry Confirmed!
So is this true?
Till now no one has asked me to go on Bigg Boss this season
and neither have I told anyone that I want to go on Bigg Boss
So first of all
this tells you the standard of our Indian media
They will publish anything without any hesitation
Scroll down and see the article in Economic Times
there is a disclaimer
This content is authored by a 3rd party
Please take all steps necessary
to ascertain that any information and content provided
is correct updated and verified
They do not take responsibility for the materials they post
They shift the responsibility on you to ascertain whether the news is true or not
And the second thing here is that
some of you would be wondering
if I am invited to Big Boss
will I go on Big Boss?
Let me say this clearly
even if they offer to pay me to be on the show
hundreds of thousands millions any amount of money
I will never go to such a nonsense show in my life
In my opinion this is a very cheap way to earn money and fame
which has a bad impact on society
So in todays video I would like to explain
what is problematic in the concept of this show?
Is this show scripted?
And why you should not watch such shows at all
If you or any of your family members
waste their time watching Bigg Boss
then this video is for you
Now theres news of
famous YouTuber Dhruv Rathees
possible wildcard entry in Big Boss
Once this guy Siddharth Yadav
made a YouTube video in which
he said that there are so many jobless people in our country
who watch Salman Khans movies
that have neither heads nor tails
This gives you an idea
of how many jobless people we have in our country
who enjoy watching such movies
that make no sense
But because it is Salman Khans movie
even if the ticket costs thousand rupees
they need to watch Salman Khans movies
regardless of anything
He was somewhat right
We shouldnt consume any content
that doesnt have any intellectual or profound content
that arent productive
Its a different matter that
he is in Bigg Boss house now
But its also true that
Bigg Boss is the most apt place for this type of person
People like him deserve to go on Bigg Boss
and in fact to win it
Im sure he can win this show
Because there are some specific qualities
that are required for this shows concept
Based on which this show can run
Ill tell you about that later in the video
but first
lets know the history of this show
How did this show begin?
In 1949 writer George Orwell
published a legendary novel
called 1984
This book talks about a dictatordystopian government
which is headed by
an unknown Big Brother
Posters are put up everywhere
Big Brother is watching you
The dictatorial government
is always watching you
In 1999
some guys in the Netherlands
took a similar concept from this novel
and turned it into a TV show
which they named Big Brother
The concept of this show was that
some people would live in a house
under constant surveillance
and under the command of Big Brother
To shape the format of this TV show
they took inspiration from some older TV shows also
Such as the MTV reality show
The Real World
and a 1997 Swedish TV show
Expedition Robinson
After a while this show became very popular
and started spreading all over the world
Copying this concept
America Canada Mexico
Brazil Argentina Australia
Indonesia Thailand the Philippines
China and Russia
made their Big Brothers
And when it comes to copying
the Indian entertainment industry cant lag behind
Big Brother was made into Big Boss in India
It was soon launched in different languages
After Hindi came Marathi Tamil Bengali
Telugu Kannada Malayalam
Then when OTT platforms came
they made Big Boss OTT
Big Boss
George Orwell mentioned Big Brother as a warning in his book
He was criticizing governments like Stalin and Hitler
and the techniques used in these dictatorships
to fool people
How propaganda for fascism is run on the telescreen
And there is constant surveillance
no one is safe from it
History is rewritten
The people display the bandwagon effect
Facts are presented in a completely distorted manner
And a cult personality is created around the Supreme Leader
The political opponents who question this dictatorial government
have to deal with conspiracy theories against them
They are declared antinational
Many famous slogans were given by this book
like Ignorance is power
Freedom is slavery
War is peace
Even today this novel is very relevant
especially when the governments buy software like Pegasus
using tax money
to surveil people to snoop
So this novel is a mustread
I would definitely recommend you read it
If you dont have time to read the novel
you can go to ChatGPT
and ask ChatGPT for a summary
Ill simply need to write
Explain the novel 1984 by George Orwell
in ten bullet points
using simple language
And here you can see
I have got a very good summary
of the story in this novel
It is about a man named Winston Smith
If you want to expand on any point
Elaborate on point 4
how were historical record changed?
Ask how history was rewritten in the novel
It is written here that if a wrong prediction is made by the party
people like Winstons were tasked with
changing the old news records
so that it looks like the party had made the right prediction
With the help of AI tools like ChatGPT
it has become so easy to understand complex ideas

Coming back to the topic
what are shows like Big Brother and Big Boss doing?
Contrary to this novel
they are providing you the cheapest form of entertainment
which has a heavy dose of two things
Everyday sadism and voyeurism
First lets look at sadism
The definition of this word is something like this
The tendency to derive pleasure
from inflicting pain suffering or humiliation on others
Enjoying hurting others and insulting them
You may find this shocking
but if you are a part of the audience watching Big Boss
then you are taking part in this sadistic pleasure too
Normally a sadistic personality is associated
with murderers or psychopaths
Only psychopath people
who kill others or hurt others
and enjoy it as they derive pleasure in doing so
But some psychological studies
have discovered a less extreme category of sadism
which is called Everyday Sadism
Like this study from 2013
which was published in the reputed journal
Psychological Science
They conducted psychological experiments on Everyday Sadism
Let me give you some examples
Youd remember that in the ancient Roman Empire
as you must have read in your text books
that the Colosseum in Rome
was a stadium for public entertainment
Here gladiators would often fight each other
Many times when a gladiator would get badly injured
the audience in the stadium would be asked
whether to let him go or to kill him
Many times the people would give a thumbs up
to kill him
Often in this arena
a hungry animal would be sent
like a tiger or a lion
to fight this gladiator
This is a good example of Everyday Sadism
because the people sitting in the stadium
were looking for entertainment in the suffering of a gladiator
Moving forward thousands of years
today many people enjoy watching street fights
When two people start fighting on the road
whatever the reason
often a crowd gathers
Very few people try to stop the fight
Most people just stand around
and enjoy the fight
Another example of this are the bullies
People who like to bully others
in school or college
People who enjoy humiliating others
Or you would have seen people who
will start kicking or throwing stones at dogs  on the side of the road for no reason
Just because they enjoy it
A moderate example of this in an office could be
a boss who is always criticising an employee for no reason
Not because he wants to get some work done
Just because he enjoys
inflicting mental pain on his employees
These are the major examples of Everyday Sadism
Mob lynching is another example
This year in May
a Bihar migrant worker
was lynched in Kerala by a crowd
when accusations were raised that he was a thief
Something similar happened in the Palghar incident
when two sadhus were lynched
because of a rumour that they were child kidnappers
Its a different matter that later
some biased media anchors
put a HinduMuslim touch to this
to give it a communal angle
You will see many examples of Everyday Sadism everywhere
If someone on the street says that
they have caught a pickpocketer
4 people would gather and start beating him
They justify their actions by saying that
they beat him because he was a pickpockter
But in reality the reason for such things is
to derive sadistic pleasure
by beating someone
You can see this Everyday Sadism in political binaries as well
Like when journalist Vinod Dua passed away
There was a group of people who were celebrating this
On the other hand when news anchor Rohit Sardana passed away
There were some people on the other side who were celebrating this
Now criticizing the work of these people is one thing
but taking a sadistic pleasure in their passing away
finding ones happiness in anothers death
is a good example of sadism
People often have many justifications
in the name of Everyday Sadism
Some say that this is the justice of nature
and some say that this is karma
But actually all of this is sadism
People derive sadistic pleasure
when they see someone getting insulted or trolled
Entire YouTube channels are often made on this
Where in each and every video someone gets insulted
someone gets abused or someone gets bullied
Now I am not criticizing the roast format here
because making roast videos can be an art
It can be done positively
without sadism
A good example of this would be
Slaypoints YouTube channel
which makes roast videos
They criticize stupid things
like being an irrational motivational guru
or some absurd food recipes
But they poke fun on the stupidity
They do not intend to abuse bully or insult someone
A 2018 study by the University of Innsbruck showed
how everyday sadists
like to play especially violent video games
Because thats what uplifts their mood
Thats what gives them happiness
Often films are made to exploit this sadism
They are called Torture Films
Like the Saw series
or Human Centipede
Some people liked Jokers character in the film Dark Knight
because perhaps their own sadistic personality
gets validated by that
But on the other hand there are some films
that I would like to state as examples
which sensitively depict sadism
For example the film The Platform
or Snowpiercer
Criticizing the socioeconomic system
showing violence without glorifying it
And finally if we come to Bigg Boss
TV shows like Big Brother and Bigg Boss
exploit this Everyday Sadism
They try to appease this
Their formula is that people like to watch this nonsense
so they give them nonsense
And to be honest this Everyday Sadism in Bigg Boss
reaches the next level
Contestants always fight with each other
There are often physical fights
People throw utensils at each other
In one case a contestant threw boiling water at another
Theres physical violence
In one case a contestant chokeslammed another contestant
The contestants arent the only ones to do this
rather the concept of the show encourages this
For example once the contestants were given a torture task
in which they had to throw chilli powder on the faces of other contestants
The contestants are made to do such nonsensical tasks
so that they can be humiliated
People are asked to bathe in cow dung
A man was asked to drink water from a dog bowl
Often people leak each others personal matters
which makes people cry
You get to see body shaming
A female contestant tells another female contestant
that some people were not worthy of standing with her
Criticising their physical appearance
Backbiting is a crucial component of this show
You regularly see misogyny and homophobia
Sometimes someone mixes soap in someones water
Sometimes a guy breaks the lock of the washroom
when a girl is taking a shower
Often you see toxic relationships
Some of these are fake relationships
which are shown just to increase the shows TRP
Then comes the concept of Voyeurism
This word means
taking cheap pleasure in watching other peoples lives
Enjoying closely watching what happens in other peoples private lives
Once again you will see many examples of this in your daily life
Like if there is an MMS leak
You see people searching on Google to find it
Another example of this could be
some people like to watch daily vlogs
There are some YouTubers whose vlogs are aimed at
when they woke up brushed their teeth
played with their dog rode their bicycle
and then they went shopping
Why do people find these things entertaining?
Because of voyeurism
People enjoy watching whats going on in their personal lives
And its a shame that some YouTubers even exploit this
Like their child may be crying
but they think about getting the camera  because it will be good content
Their child might be hurt
but first they take the camera and film it
If there is a fight at home
they want to be the ones to stream it
So that they get some content
Many people often make a dangerous onesided parasocial relationship
with daily vloggers
In my opinion children should not be allowed
to watch daily vlogs
Since childrens brains are not fully developed
so voyeurism can be very dangerous for them
Another moderate example of this is CCTV footages
People enjoy watching
CCTV footage of thieves being captured
or someone being murdered  or a terrorist attack or road accidents
Media houses also often play these footages on TV
So Everyday Voyeurism
obviously increases in a surveillance state
So if we talk about Bigg Boss again
then this Everyday Voyeurism is exploited badly by Bigg Boss
In Bigg Boss 16 98 cameras were installed inside the house
And now a different level of madness is taking place regarding voyeurism
Contestants are often recorded 24x7 with multicameras
and the audience is also allowed to watch them 24x7 on a live feed
They can choose any of the three cameras
and choose what they want to watch
And as you know there is so much  unemployment in the country that
there are a lot of people who are free
who have no other work
so they start watching this
By watching the live feed of these cameras
one can take some voyeuristic pleasure
People often share their personal secrets  with their close friends and best friends
But here people are told
to tell their personal secrets on national television
To generate content and TRP
And the amazing thing is that
nothing about this reality TV show is real
Contestants know that they are being recorded for 24 hours
with so many cameras
So will any contestant
behave in their natural state here?
Will your behaviour be the same
as it is normally?
Not at all
Everyone will be selfconscious to some extent
Secondly an artificial competitive setup is created in this show
so that you will naturally have to insult others
and backbite others
if you want to rise above them
In Bigg Boss house this is called performance
These interactions between people
are these natural interactions
that would happen in real life?
In real life
if so many people have to live in a house
there will hardly be a fight between them
Here such setups are forced
to create arguments and fights between people
The truth is friends
the world is not that stupid
Although I have told you many examples of  Everyday Sadism and Everyday Voyeurism
But most people are not like that
There are many intellectual wellbehaved
dignified and compassionate people in the world
Take Dr Vikas Divyakirti for example
He has made many educational videos on philosophical topics
Or if we talk about actors and actresses
take Konkana Sen for example
She has given so many great performances in so many films
But in the 17 seasons of Bigg Boss
you would not have seen a single person like Dr Vikas Divyakirti or Konkana Sen
Firstly nice people will never go to such cheap shows
But secondly
even if a nice person goes to such shows
they are provoked
to be part of this sadism and voyeurism
To create controversy and insult people
and if they dont they will be thrown out
There was a participant in Bigg Boss 8
Sushant Divgikar
A model singer dancer psychologist
and winner of Mr Gay India 2014
He was thrown out of Bigg Boss very quickly
Later he said in an interview that
he has more than 500 books at home
he reads a lot and has an IQ of 147
But he said that he was sad to say that the collective IQ of the Bigg Boss 8 contestants
was less than room temperature
All the while Sushant lived in that house
Sushant didnt fight with anyone
he just kept busy with his songs and dance routines
But you dont get TRP like this
You get TRP only when
theres conflict or fights among contestants
Bhojpuri star Khesari Lal Yadav
was a contestant in Bigg Boss 13
He was also thrown out of the house very quickly
And when he gave an interview to Times of India
he said that the format of the show
doesnt suit him
Humans become devils in this house
And if you want to move ahead in this show
you can do so only by insulting and humiliating others
This was what he said
I was amid devils there
There in the form of humans
everyone was behaving like devils
And no one is human in there
What can anyone do?
Bigg Boss Season 4 contestant Rahul Bhatt said in an interview
I cant provide entertainment
to viewers at the cost of making a fool of myself
Why would the channel want to keep someone on the show
if there is no controversy or romance involving them?
So on the face of it it looks like
there is no public voting here
Only the TRP decides who will be thrown out of the house
Bigg Boss Season 9 contestant Aman Verma also said that
he had a preplanned deal with the producers
that he will be in the house for only 6 weeks
A Sunday special episode of Bigg Boss 16 was hosted by Shekhar Suman
He had criticized some of the contestants
but the viewers criticized him
for pointing out only some of the contestants
So he replied by saying that
he had been given a script
written by the channel
that he had to follow
Bigg Boss 4 winner Shweta Tiwari
Bigg Boss 6 contestant Aashka Goradia
and Bigg Boss 11 runnerup Hina Khan said
that this show is heavily edited
The long conversations
are shown as two lines only
It is deliberately shown
as if there are misunderstandings between the shows contestants
sheer misrepresentations
Aashka said that she was rubbing a balm  on another female contestants hand
after she had an allergic reaction
But the shows editors
used editing tricks
and showed only half of the things
and made it look like
she was a lesbian
Bigg Boss 7s contestant Shilpa Saklani says that
the show is not scripted
but that everyone knows what to do to win
There are prerequisites
to react and give content
to fight with each other
to put across their point of view
and to be assertive
So even if we ignore these accusations
of the show being scripted
even if we believe that the show is not scripted
some things are very clear in front of us
First there are no auditions here
Contestants are chosen by the makers of the show
Based on what?
Well it seems like based on intrigue
Second 24hour footage is edited to be a 50minute episode
Which of those 50 minutes are shown?
Those that will attract the most viewers
Third the viewers perception based on that edit
influences the voting
Often the rules are also bent
Sometimes there are no eliminations on some weekends
Sometimes the contestants who have been eliminated
are called back into the house
and sometimes there is a wildcard entrant
Everything is decided by the makers of the show
based on its saleability
Fourth the tasks given in the show
are also decided by the makers of the show
based on saleability
And what is saleable here?
No intellectual discussion
No social issues philosophy history
sociology spirituality
poetry literature cinema or science
None of it is being discussed here
People just want to watch others fighting
People want to see their personal lives
People want to see people backbiting others
People want to see other people insulting each other
A cocktail of Everyday Sadism and Voyeurism
Whose show is it?  The show makers
Whos money is invested?  The show makers
Whos time is being wasted?  Yours!
And whose mental state is being affected?
When Honey Singh is asked about his misogynist songs
he replies that its just entertainment
That it is what the public wants
If you ask the showmakers of Bigg Boss
about what they are showing to the public
he will also reply similarly
The same excuse is used
that its just entertainment
The public wants this  thats why they show it
Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment
Friends the thing is watching such things can affect you too
Psychiatrist Dr Marcia Sirota claims that
just like our teeth and health are affected by junk food
bad reality TV shows
affects our brains
and we become ruder
When people see the reality TV shows
and how celebrities become rich and famous on it
by abusing people
doing weird things
and by becoming selfserving egoistics
the audience is convinced by this perception
The audience starts believing that if they want to earn money and fame
then this is the best way
Doing such cheap things
Telecasting their personal life on national TV
Insulting bullying and roasting other people
Brian Gibson a psychologist at Central Michigan University
did a study and concluded that
watching such reality TV shows
leads to an increase in aggression in the viewers
Comparing to violent media and crime TV shows
reality TV shows cause a higher increase than them
An effect on the mental health of the contestants is also evident
Many contestants have said that
after the show they had to deal with so many mental health issues
Many contestants who were so determined to win
that they reveal their personal secrets
later regretted doing so
Some contestants are made into villains in the public perception
even though they are not that bad in real life
Then the public criticism that people have to face after coming on the show
that causes a lot of anxiety among the contestants
Shamita Shetty Sana Khan Kushal Tandon
Nikki Tamboli Kavita Kaushik Shalin Bhanot
Rahul Vaidya Himanshi Khurana
Apurva Agnihotri and Shilpa Shaklani
are the examples of those people
who faced mental health issues after going on the show
and after the show they had to take therapy
So I request everyone
to not treat their brain like a dustbin
Your brain is not a dustbin
that you can keep throwing any rubbish into it
The content you are consuming
choose it wisely
The type of entertainment you are consuming
think about what effect it is having on you
Does it have a positive impact on your life or a negative impact?
And I am not saying that you should always consume intellectual content
Even if you want to consume nonintellectual entertainment
think about it first
Will it have a positive or negative impact on you?
And obviously if you spend your time learning new things
it will have a very positive impact
