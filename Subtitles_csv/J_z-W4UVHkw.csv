Now that everyone made a goal
Do you know whats happening?  I know whats happening
Chandler bring it on out!
The real challenge starts now
Its about to get a lot harder
I think this is where well lose our first person
Thats too tight  So much on the line
I thought it was going to be easy
Its only like six foot wide
Someones getting out
Come on Slovenia!
Hype them up everybody!
Even though we made the goal smaller they were still scoring
Were going to have to make this much more difficult
Nobodys missing
Eventually someones got to miss
Oh no!  The first miss
Im sorry man But youre eliminated
That hurts
I dont know where he ran to
And now only six remain
Instead of adding more walls
were just going to move them like this a little bit
It needs to be one Chandler wide
All right Slovenia youre up
Yeah  Wow
The heat just doesnt stop
Take your time
Theyre dropping like flies
I could have done better but
it was the best five days of my life
This is getting harder now
Yeah this is a competition
And now only five remain
Im going to win you!
Yeah baby!
All right Samoa Youre up
It could all come down to this
The fans think its Samoa
Samoa! Samoa!
It hit the X
Obviously its disappointing
not to be able to win but it was phenomenal
I think I did my people proud
Im sorry man
Every country on the planet has competed in these games
And were now on our final two Libya and Slovenia
One of you is going to walk away with this 250000 gold medal
Jimmy is going to do a plot twist
Its a big one
Boys can you remove the walls?
Instead of walls
You each are going to take turns being goalkeepers
We go until someone scores and someone doesnt
Pretty simple  Im going to catch it
Im nervous
That faked me out  That faked me out
Hes ice cold
Well after that now he has to make it
He blocked it!  Yeah!
If you make this shot you officially win our Olympics
I cant believe this
All you have to do is make the shot and youve won
Im going to win

Its 20 pounds be careful
The golden medal I cant believe this
You can probably sell this for 250000 tomorrow
