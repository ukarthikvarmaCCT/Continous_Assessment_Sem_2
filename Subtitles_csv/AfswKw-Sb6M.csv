Hello friends!
On 21st August 1911
it was a Monday morning in the French capital Paris
It was quite bustling
People were going to work in their offices
when suddenly three men came out of the Louvre museum
The three had spent the previous night in the museum
And now they were carrying an  important property of the Louvre Museum
that was hidden in a blanket
while they tried to escape
They went to a nearby railway station
and caught the train at 845 in the morning
and disappeared
The whole world was unaware of the fact that
they had stolen a painting
Not an insignificant painting
The worlds most famous painting
The Mona Lisa
Today the value of this painting
is close to 1 billion
What is the reason behind this?
What are the secrets hidden in the Mona Lisa?
Why is this the most famous painting in the world?
Lets understand the mystery of the Mona Lisa
in todays video
Mona Lisa was painted in 1503
by an Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci
And this man was so amazing
that you wont even believe it
Not only was he a painter
but also an engineer scientist
sculptor architect and theorist
He had knowledge of so many subjects
be it painting cartography
astronomy anatomy
botany hydrology
geology optics or even palaeontology
An entire video can be made on his life
So without talking about him too much
lets get to Mona Lisa
Which was his most famous painting
But who was this person in the painting?
People have always been curious about  the identity of the woman in the painting
The first revelation about this was made by
an Italian artist named Giorgio Vasari
who wrote the autobiography  of Leonardo da Vinci in 1550
According to Vasari this woman was
Lisa Gherardini
She was married to a silk trader who lived in Florence
Francesco Giocondo
He believed that Francesco had  commissioned this painting of his wife
and thats the origin of the names of this painting
The first name that we all know
Mona Lisa
derived from Madonna Lisa
Traditionally in Italian
the word Madonna was used to mean Madam
So Madonna Lisa meant Madam Lisa
The word Madonna was later shortened to Monna
Monna with a double N
When this was written in English
an N was dropped
and Monna became Mona
So Mona Lisa means
Madam Lisa or Lady Lisa
And then comes Mona Lisas other name
which is La Gioconda
After her marriage Lisa Gherardini
became Lisa Giocondo
Interestingly in Italian Giocondo means
lighthearted or cheerful
Meaning bright and joyful
And today Mona Lisa is very famous for her smile
So thats where it got its name
La Giocondo
In French the word Giocondo is written with a J
like this Joconde
So thats why when you go to the Louvre Museum in Paris
and see the painting of Mona Lisa
in French it would be identified as La Joconde
Now the interesting thing is that
in 1550 despite this revelation
people were not ready to believe that
Vasaris narrative was correct
Many theories started to emerge
about this woman being someone else
Some people said that she  was Leonardo da Vincis mother
Some said that this was a painting  of a queen from the Italian aristocracy
The most interesting theory was that
in this painting da Vinci painted himself
That this painting is not of a woman
but in fact a selfportrait of Da Vinci
Where he imagined
how he would have looked had he been a woman
This theory was promoted by  artist Lilian Schwartz in an article in 1987
She used digital tools to
try to show similarities between
Leonardo Da Vincis face
and Mona Lisas image
With this logic any two faces
can be seen as similar by placing them on top of each other
But today we can say with a lot of certainty that
the woman painted here
is indeed Lisa Giocondo
A professor living in Florence
researched this for 25 years
and found the archives
and in 2004 he discovered clear evidence
to prove this fact
He also found that
the da Vinci family had a close relationship
with Francesco Giocondos family
He also found a record that
Lisas marriage was registered on 5th March 1495
when Lisa was 16 years old
and Francesco was around 30 years old
He found that Leonardo da Vincis father
and Lisas husband knew each other very well
And its possible that
this painting was commissioned not by Lisas husband
but by Leonardos father
Pallanti says that
when the Mona Lisa was painted
Lisa was 24 years old
And that there might have been  two reasons for painting this
The first reason is that in 1503
when Francesco and Lisa bought their home
or the second reason is that
in December 1502
when their second son was born
The second reason seems more probable
because three years before this in 1499
Lisa lost her daughter
If you look at this painting closely
you will see a veil over Lisas hair
Many people call it a mourning veil
It is a veil that is worn when
someone in the family has passed away
Now one question arises here
if Da Vinci was Italian
Mona Lisa was Italian
then why is this painting in France today?
Well the thing about this is that
in the year 1516
the king of France King Francis I
invited Leonardo da Vinci to live in France
And so da Vinci moved from Italy to France
And took with him the Mona Lisa
Historical records arent clear about this
but its believed that da Vinci  hadnt completed the painting yet
15 years after starting the painting
he was still working on this painting
trying to modify it and make it better
Meanwhile in the year 1519
Leonardo da Vinci passed away during his stay in the French palace
And the king kept this painting  as a part of his Royal Collection
About 150 years in 1797
when the French Revolution happened
this painting was taken out of the palace
and handed over to the Louvre Museum
I have made a separate video on the French Revolution
in case you havent seen it yet
its link is in the description
The interesting thing is that
this is the reason why
the Mona Lisa was stolen in 1911
I had talked about this at the beginning of the video
The mastermind of this theft was Vincenzo Peruggia
He stole this painting together with his two friends
He was an Italian Nationalist
He believed that this painting belonged to Italy
Not in France
And so after stealing it they took it to Italy
Stealing such a famous painting was a risky job
especially when the value of  the painting was in millions of dollars
So obviously Vincenzo wouldnt have felt safe after this theft

Now lets get back to Vincenzo
the Italian nationalist
We will talk about what happens next later in the video
But before that lets know the speciality of this painting
Why is it so special?
First of all
the Mona Lisa was not painted on paper canvas or cloth
Instead it was painted on poplar wood
In those days it was the favourite wood of Italian painters
Secondly this painting isnt large
Look at the photos
This is where it hangs in the museum
You can see its size in comparison to the people
This painting is only 77 cm by 53 cm
But still it is considered so special
because in its time in Italy
this was the first painting
which focused so closely on the person
This is a halflength portrait
These types of shots are very common in photography today
But no one used to make such paintings in those days
If you look at the overall colour grading of this painting
you will see a lot of brown and yellow shades    It looks like a very dull painting It is so yellowish that at one point a professor declared Lisa a cholesterol patient But there are two reasons behind this First a varnish layer has been applied to this painting so that moisture does not affect the painting badly
It looks like a dull painting
It is so yellowish that once a professor
had declared Lisa to be a patient with high cholesterol
But there are two reasons for this
First there is a layer of varnish on top of this painting
So that there are no illeffects of moisture on this painting
since it was painted on wood
So its necessary to protect it from humidity and moisture
And secondly
over time there was bleaching
Originally when this was painted
it used to be more bright and colourful
Some people tried to recreate this painting
to see how it would have looked originally
Da Vinci used a very special painting style in this painting
known as Sfumato
The technique of blending
The background you see in this painting
is a landscape
It is the Arno Valley in Italy
There are no clear boundaries or outlines  between the background and Mona Lisa
In some places Mona Lisas hair is blended with the landscape
Blurring the outlines and blending the colours
is the technique of Sfumato
This is the secret behind Mona Lisas mysterious smile
Look at Mona Lisas smile carefully
The more you look at this smile
the more serious this face will look
But now look into Mona Lisas eyes
Suddenly you will see Lisa smiling more
If you look at any part of the painting
be it the background Mona Lisas forehead or her eyes
you will see the effect
Lisas face starts smiling more
when you dont focus on the smile
To perfect this smile
da Vinci spent the most time
He spent many nights in a hospital in Florence
where he used to go and remove the skin of d3ad bodies
He wanted to study the facial muscles and nerves
and how they work together to create a smile
He wrote in his book that
the muscles which move the lips
are more numerous in man
than in any other animal
It was very difficult for him to dissect the muscles of the lips
because the muscles here are tiny and numerous
During this experiment
da Vinci studied horses as well
He compared human expressions to that of horses
In the notes he wrote
Notice whether the muscle that
raises the nostrils of the horse
is the same as that which
lies here in man
Hardly throughout history any other artist
has dissected the faces of a horse and a human
and done these experiments
His obsession with Mona Lisas smile
didnt end here
After this he did research on optics as well
He found that the light rays
dont merge together into a single point on our eyes
rather they spread out over the entire retina
The centre of the retina
known as the Fovea
helps us see the finest details
On the other hand the rest of the retina
picks up shadows and blackandwhite imagery more
Using this knowledge
he focused on the shadows in such a way that
even when you see the Mona Lisa in your peripheral vision
as in if you are looking this way  and Mona Lisa is on the other side
even if you are not paying attention to Mona Lisa
the effect of her smile is still there
When you look at her smile closely
you will see that its central line is a flat line
is why when you look at her smile
it looks like she is not smiling at all
But on the other hand  the shadows created using the Sfumato technique
have such an effect that
when you look elsewhere
your peripheral vision sees that smile
and its shadows are reflected
And then you feel that Lisa is smiling
How would it feel if I told you that
the Mona Lisa is not one painting
rather two paintings
This is not a conspiracy theory
its the truth
Mona Lisas painting as we know
a similar painting was created
at the same time
The story of this second Mona Lisa began
in the year 1504
when another legendary artist named Raphael
made a rough sketch using pen and ink
This sketch looked something like this
and if you compare it with the Mona Lisa in Louvre
you can see a huge difference
In this sketch by Raphael
you can see two columns behind Mona Lisa
Here the researchers believed that
Raphael must have made his drawing based on the Mona Lisa painting
So it was initially brushed off
But this theory was disproved by  a German art historian in 1993
And Professor Pallanti whom I had mentioned earlier
who had been researching the identity of the Mona Lisa for 25 years
confirmed that Raphael actually
lived right in front of the Giocondo family in Florence
So does this mean that Raphael
made an original painting
on the same subject
with the same woman in the same pose?
This seems quite unbelievable
Another answer to this question could be that
another Mona Lisa painting exists
which inspired Raphael to make this drawing
And this second Mona Lisa painting was revealed to the world
in 1914
A novelist living near London
John R Eyer
had a new version of the Mona Lisa
This is the new Mona Lisa painting
The same painting based on which
Raphael made his drawing
This second Mona Lisa
is 35 inches longer
and 5 inches wider than the one in the Louvre
If you compare these two paintings
you will notice three things
First the woman in this new Mona Lisa
looks much younger
Second the head in this new painting
is tilted a little forward
And third the expressions of this new Mona Lisa
are very straightforward and clear
There is nothing mysterious about her smile
that is in the Mona Lisa in Louvre
The two columns in the background
are the ones seen in Raphaels drawing
Due to these reasons
a new theory is coined by the experts
That Leonardo da Vinci was actually working on two Mona Lisas
Leonardo da Vinci painted both these Mona Lisa
But the Isleworth Mona Lisa that was later discovered
was the first version of da Vincis painting
He was experimenting with his style then
And this is why the Mona Lisa in that painting
looks younger than the other Mona Lisa
This theory remains a topic of debate to date
In 2010 the Mona Lisa Foundation
started an investigation on the Isleworth Mona Lisa
to find out the secret behind it
And they came up with another theory
They said that the face and hands of this new Mona Lisa
were indeed painted by da Vinci
But the background was painted by an inferior artist
Perhaps a person working in Leonardos workshop
had finished this painting
Both these theories remain mere theories
because no solid evidence has been found on either side
Coming back to the theft of the Mona Lisa
it was found that the mastermind of this theft Vincenzo Peruggia
was an employee in the Louvre Museum
One day he hid in some corner in the museum
and spent the night there
after which the next morning he walked out with the painting
He believed that since Leonardo da Vinci was an Italian
this painting should be in an Italian museum
When the news of the theft spread
it made headlines all over the world
Scores of detectives were put to work
to look for the thief
But no one could find him
For two years Peruggia hid this painting at his home
He wondered what he could do with it
The whole world was looking for it
Finally he became impatient
and tried to sell the painting
He tried to sell this painting to an art dealer in Florence
To Giovanni Poggi
Giovanni became suspicious
and saw the stamp on the painting to confirm that
it was the stolen painting
He was being sold the most wanted item in the world
Because of this Vincenzo was caught
and was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment
The painting was sent back to the Louvre Museum
and was hung up on 4th January 1914
Today this painting is displayed there
behind bulletproof glass
in strict climatecontrolled conditions
where humidity is maintained at 50  10
temperature is strictly maintained at 18C to 21C
Perhaps the most interesting part in this story is that
only after this theft
did Mona Lisas popularity start increasing
And it became the worlds 1 famous painting
Thats right
Before the theft the Mona Lisa was not very famous
People who were interested in art
knew about the Mona Lisa but
the common folks did not know about the Mona Lisa
So if you go to the Louvre Museum
and see the painting of the Mona Lisa
and you see a crowd of people around it
then you can blame Vincenzo for this popularity
