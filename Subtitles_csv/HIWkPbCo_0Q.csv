youtuber gaurav taneja aka flying beast made a tweet a few days back
hes an iit graduate and i was surprised to see him buy into this kind of
just goes to show no matter how educated you are you can still fall prey to it wre gonna look at
this claim analyze where it comes from and talk about such religious science claims in general
for those who dont know gaurav tanija which i think is very few of you his youtube channel is
called flying beast he uploads daily vlogs and uses the cuteness of his children for clickbait
this he has been criticized for a lot but whatever you might think he is a very skilled youtuber very
well respected in the vlogging community his vlogs get a million plus views every day he has a loyal
fan base and i expect this video to be getting a ton of dislikes soon but i must do what i do
on this channel which is fight irrationality being spread by these pages but this time its not just
another huge youtube channel its run by an iit kharagpur alumnus a qualified pilot a bodybuilder
and someone who has recently gotten into studying law but no amount of education can remove the
years of religious indoctrination as shown by this tweet but you know what lets not jump to
conclusions lets actually analyze what he said in this tweet because hey you can make extraordinary
claims you just have to back it up with extraordinary evidence lets see what evidence
he actually provides two families survived the bhopal gas tragedy uh by doing agni hotra thats
the fire ceremony that you can see him doing in this picture here now the bhopal gas tragedy was
a factory accident that took place in 1984 where this highly toxic gas called mic methyl isocyanate
leaked in the city of bhopal leaked into residence houses and thousands of people lost their lives
now if you want to learn what led up to the accident and what happened after it i highly
recommend dhruv rathees video ive linked it in the description now where does this claim
come from all sources point to a newspaper article that was apparently published in 1985 which talks
about these two families that woke up in the on the night of the tragedy vomiting because of the
poisonous gases toxic gases and instead of evacuating like any sane family would they decide
to sit and do agnihotra and within 20 minutes their symptoms of gas parsoning vanished now
how can that be possible when methyl isocyanate is flammable it burns producing even more toxic gases
like hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide etc how on earth can you perform a fire ceremony in its
presence hey in case you dont die by breathing in mic you can ensure that you burn your entire
house down by doing this okay lets assume that the gas is not flammable or maybe it wasnt
in sufficient enough quantity to catch fire noticeably even then there is a logical fallacy
when you come to this conclusion when you say that the agni hotra is what saved the lives of those
people lets see what it is we dont know how much of this claim is true especially given that mic is
flammable this newspaper article sounds like a whatsapp forward by someone who wanted to use a
tragedy involving the the deaths of thousands of people to promote their version of superiority of
their religion even if you assume the details of the story to be true this conclusion that has been
drawn has a logical flaw in it when you say that a happened and then b happened therefore a caused b
youre mistaking correlation for causation the agni hotra and the families surviving the tragedy are
two events that are correlated but if you conclude that they survived because of this agnihotra then
you are committing this fallacy youre ignoring all the other factors that may have been bigger
reasons for why they survived like how much of the toxic gas was in the air what was the airflow
like that night with respect to the houses uh what was the wind speed and direction in
the location and how far away was the house from the factory and how did all these factors affect
how much toxic gases were in the air we shouldnt jump to conclusions without a clear knowledge of
all these factors especially when the claim were making is extraordinary like this extraordinary
claims require extraordinary evidence im not rejecting the claim im simply not accepting it
because there is no convincing evidence but when it comes to Gaurav Tanejas claims on the
uh scientific superiority of the vedic scriptures it doesnt stop there lets see what else he said
in this video uploaded on august 8 2019 he talks about how although we see things from this lens
of modern science in the world today as we get older and we learn more about the world we
start losing our belief in modern science and we start trusting the vedas in our scriptures
he says how theres all the science in the bhagavadgita how it talks about atoms and
electrons and protons which honestly is a load of bull and ill explain why science is a method
it is not a body of knowledge it is not a list of facts and theories or our list of solutions
to problems it is a way of thinking a way of learning things about the world primarily through
observation a way of figuring out how true something is and if it should go in such a list
or not i have an entire playlist on my channel on this scientific method feel free to watch
now someone comes to me and says that theres this book from centuries ago which talks about
atoms and electrons and protons and the theory of evolution and they figured all this out without
using the scientific method then whatever that book says cannot be called scientific they may
be true or false but definitely not scientific we learned about electrons and protons through
careful experimentation and observation we learned about evolution through observation can you tell
me back when the bhagavadgita was written how could they have performed the experiments that led
to those conclusions they couldnt have but pranav you ask if they werent using the scientific
method how were they right i have two answers for your question one given what you know today you
try and force fit modern discoveries and try and find parallels that are there in the scriptures
that match with modern discoveries modern theories modern facts that we discovered recently and you
tend to ignore everything else that doesnt match with anything that we know today
this is a combination of hindsight bias and confirmation bias the other reason is
imagine youre in a dark room somewhere in the room there is a dart board and you have a bunch
of darts if you start throwing the darts what percentage of them will hit the mark a very
low percentage right you can see how its not zero percent even if you throw randomly in some
direction you could hit the bullseye its unlikely but you could hit it right now imagine if the room
was dimly lit you can make out some details in the room you can see roughly where the dart
board is and that helps you throw better making your throws get a higher percentage accuracy
and what if the room was well lit your accuracy would go up tremendously right the chance of you
not hitting the mark will only depend on how good or bad your aim is the same way back when
these books were written if there are things that turned out to be factually correct in these books
those small percentage of shorts in the dark that hit their mark a huge number
of these statements are just plain false but you ignore them and pick only the ones that are true
knowing what you know today and you call them scientific what logic is this things
like ayurveda probably did a lot of trial and error before arriving at their results
and they probably had better accuracy much like the dimly lit room from my example
but simple trial and error is prone to a lot of mistakes which are overcome by modern medical
trials ive gone to that extensively in this video plus we had no knowledge of germ theory before the
17th century plus with advancements in chemistry and biology we know the mechanisms in which these
medicines work and that has helped us design much more better medications for certain conditions
we also have ways of evaluating the safety of medicines which we didnt have back then
ayurveda may have achieved results many centuries ago doesnt mean its the best tool we have today
there is a very prevalent narrative that i whether superior to modern medicine ive heard many people
say it please dont buy into it what we have today is like my third example a much brighter room of
course we can miss but the chance of hitting are much much higher than anything we had in the
past and plus you dont need to establish your religion cultural tradition as scientific only
people with an inferiority complex will do that your culture is beautiful as it is dont embarrass
yourself by posting tweets like this now there is a chance that he knew exactly what he was doing
he didnt actually believe what he said but he said that only to please the uh his audience or
he knew his audience really well and he knew the majority of his audience
would like a post like that and thats why he posted it in which case i dont really have
a lot to say about him hes just being really manipulative and if people dont recognize that
they can fall to traps like these so yeah and the next time you see someone say some modern
scientific fact is mentioned in scripture just remember they just shots in the dark some may hit
the mark doesnt mean they were aimed ill see you in the next one till then remember science is dope
