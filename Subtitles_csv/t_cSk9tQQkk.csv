Hello friends!
26th April 1986 at 123 AM
the Reactor Number 4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Soviet Union
The lid on top of the reactor starts shaking
And the shockwaves are felt all throughout the building
The workers present realised that
the nuclear reaction in the reactor
was completely out of control by then
And that reactor had to be stopped quickly
So one of those workers acted fast
and pressed the Emergency Shut Down button
By pressing the button the control rods were designed to enter the reactors
and prevent the reactions
But they didnt work as designed
After the button was pressed the control rods entered the reactor
but as soon as they went in there was a huge blast
A huge explosion
After this blast the reactor was engulfed in flames
The harmful radioactive material present there
rose up into the air with the flames
The amount of harmful radioactive material released in this disaster
was equal to 400 Hiroshima atomic bomb
This disaster is still considered to be the Worlds Worst Nuclear Disaster
The radiation spreading through the air
had an effect on not only Ukraine but all over Europre from Spain to Sweden also
There was radioactive rain in the United Kingdom
The radioactive dust which settled on the grass in the hills
were consumed by cows
and the amount of radiation in the milk of those cows spiked
Due to this thousands of children got Thyroid Cancer
Come in this video
lets understand why this Chernobyl disaster took place
The reasons behind it
and the effects that were seen all over the world
In a nuclear accident near the Soviet Union
once Reactor 4 the scene of a total meltdown
The explosion at a nuclear plant in the Soviet Union
Near the reactor at Ukraines Chernobyl Power Plant
the ecplosions powerful enough to blow up the steel and concrete lid
Friends after World War II
the Sovient Union invested a lot of money in nuclear power plants
It built many nuclear power plants
on of which was the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant
Its official name was
It was built in the early 1970s
even though it is named the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant
it wasnt built in the city of Chernobyl
Chernobyl was a small city
approx 16 km away from this nuclear power plant
But friends this Chernobyl Plant
was among one of the most advanced
nuclear power plants in the Sovient Union
There were four nuclear reactors in this
in the RBMK 1000 design
RBMK 1000 is a type of nuclear reactor
The operations of the first 2 reactors had begun in 1977
the third in 1981
and the fourth in 1983
The purpose of power plants is to generate electricity
In this case each reactor could produce 1000 Megawatts electricity
The four reactors could together
supply electricity to meet 10 of Ukaraines electricity demand
So you can imagine how powerful these reactors were
Coming to the Chernobyl disaster
this disaster took place in the Reactor Number 4
during a routine safety test
To understand exactly what had happened that day
we first need to understand how a nuclear reactor works
In most of the methods of generating electricity
in the simplest terms you need a rotating wheel
You need movement for kinetic energy
In hydroelectricity when the water falls from above
it moves the wheels
and creates energy
In wind energy the wind moves the turbine
which produces energy once it starts rotating
In thermal powerplants
that uses coal to generate electricity
steam is released by buring the coals
and the steam later moves the wheels
The kinetic energy is thus generated
Even in case of nuclear energy
the wheel is moved by steam
But to make that steam water has to be heated up first
whereas in thermal energy coal heats up the water
in nuclear energy
the nuclear reactions taking place
heats up the water
Look at this diagram from a school book
You dont need to get into the details
you can see a turbine that is rotated by steam
And the steam is generated
because the nuclear reaction heats up the water
This water acts as a coolant as well
To prevent overheating around the reactor
the constant supply of water is a must
In the Chernobyl plant the water came from a nearby manmade water reserve
There was a river beside it too
It is important to have a consistent supply of water at all times
For this the water pumps pushing the water into the pipes
should be working nonstop
But what happens in case of a power cut?
To ensure that the water pumps keep working at all times
There were some backup diesel generators in the Chernobyl plant
So that they could provide uninterrupted electricity to the pumps
But to start these generators
it took about 1 or 2 minutes
Within those 12 minutes
there was a need for an additional power source to ensure that the water pumps keep working
The builders of Chernobyl reactor had said that
the electricity needed for these crucial 12 minutes
could be sourced from the nuclear reactor itself
Since the turbines would be moving because of the steam
and even after a reactor shutdown there would be some amount of steam
that would last for a couple of minutes
would be enough to power those plants
So friends in the wee hours of 26 April
they were testing this
If there was a power cut
would the turbines be able to produce enough electricity
to power the water pumps?
Tihs test was run earlier as well
but this test was never successful in reactor number 4
The workers hoped that the test would be successful that illfated night
One day before this on 25th April
they had tried to conduct a test but it couldnt be carried out
And so the test was delayed by a day
The workers working in this plant
didnt even get full sleep
At 1110 PM on 25th April
they began the preparations for this test
To understand the rest of the story
we need to understand the science of reactors for a bit
The process of the nuclear reaction in the nuclear reactor
The core of the nuclear reactors the main part
is mainly built of three things
Fure rods are basically nuclear fuel
which causes the nuclear reactions
In this case Uranium Dioxide
enriched with Uranium 235 Isotope
We know that an atom is built of electrons protons and neutrons
and each element has a different number of electrons protons and neutrons
Several elements have isotopes as well
Isotopes are basically a type of variations in the elements
Take the element Uranium
which has three isotopes
Uranium238 Uranium235 and Uranium234
In different isotopes
the number of protons remains the same
but they have different number of neutrons
But there are some rare isotopes
of some elements
that can undergo the nuclear fission reactions
Uranium235 is an isotope of Uranium
which permits nuclear fission reaction
and create nuclear energy
This Uranium isotope is unstable
due to which it falls apart and released radiations
This keeps on disintegrating on its own
but it can also be broken apart if a neutron collides with it
Both cases are known as a nuclear fission reaction
In this process one atom of this element splits into two
and a few extra lonesome neutrons are formed
Additionally it releases kinetic energy as well
that converts into thermal energy
which later goes on to move the turbine
But the extra neutrons that are realeased
go and collide with more atoms
and such disintegration continues
and just like that a chain reaction begins
It is known as Nuclear Chain Reaction
To slow down this reaction
Control rods are used
In this case the control rods were made of Boron Carbide
Boron is an element which
absorbs neutrons quite well
The extra neutrons formed as a result of the nuclear fission reaction
get absorbed by Boron
and do not collide with the other atoms
and the speed of the nuclear fission reaction slows down
In the core of a nuclear reactor
when the fuel rods are inserted
the control rods are inserted beside it
to control the nuclear reaction
The more the control rods are inserted
the reaction will be proportionately slowed down
Apart from this the third thing that I told you about the Moderator
In this case graphite blocks were the moderators
These help to speed up the reaction
Graphite slows down the energy of the neutrons
increasing the chances of neutrons colliding more with Uranium atoms
Thus increasing the speed of the reaction
Today most of the nuclear plants
water is used as moderator
But in the RBMK 1000 reactors used in Chernobyl back then
graphite was used as Moderator
To summarised the science of it
imagine a car on a road
If you hit the gas pedal the speed of the car will increase
And if you hit the brakes it will slow down and eventually stop
In case of the nuclear reactor the car moving on the road
is the fuel rods of Uranium where the reaction takes place
The gas pedal works are the Moderator
The deeper you insert it the reaction would be sped up
and the control rods act as the brakes
when you hit the brakes itll slow down the reaction
The after effect of the Chernobyl disaster
was worse that that caused by the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
Today you can see the live examples of it
The disaster zone of Chernobyl
is so dangerous that people cannot go there
It is a restricted area
But the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
are populated by so many people
on that illfated night 26th April
the workers were testing the unit
Workers were tasked with
reducing the output of the nuclear power plant from 1600 MW of electricity to 700 MW
But as soon as the workers inserted the control rods
the power dropped even more
It fell below their expectations
And reached 30 MW
The workers working there couldnt comprehend why it happened
The reason for this was that in this nuclear fission reaction
a byproduct was created
Xenon 135
Similar to Boron Xenon 135 could absorb the neutrons quite efficiently
Because this byproduct was being created in this reaction
it was absorbing the excess neutrons
and the brakes were being hit quite hard
Thats why the electricity produced was lower than expected
Normally when Xenon is produced in a nuclear reaction
it burns out on its own
Or decays within a few hours
But in this case it kept getting accumulated in the nuclear core
because the power output was already so low
When high amounts of Xenon starts accumulating in the reactor core
it is known as Xenon poisoning
It kept slowing down the reaction
Seeing that very little electricity was produced
the shift supervisor Anatoly
ordered the workers to take out some of the control rods
He reasoned that taking out the control rods could speed up the reactions a bit
At 100 AM on 26th April
the power output reached 200 MW after taking out some of the control rods
But they still couldnt run their tests
Because they aimed to take the output to 700 MW
They had to speed up the reaction further
Anatoly gave the next set of instructions
He wanted to speed up the reactions by taking out more control rods
There are normally 211 control rods in a reactor
All but 8 of them were taken out
Only 8 control rods remained in the reaction chamber
This was a violation of the safety protocols
because it was clearly written in the rule book
that under any circumstances there should not be fewer than 15 control rods in the reactor
But here there were only 8 control rods in the reactor
Due to this the power output spiked up
At 0119 AM
because the control rods were abruptly taken out
the reaction spiked suddenly
The power output increased rapidly
and whatever little water was present in the core
turned into steam
It also meant that the amount of water in the reactor core kept decreasing
Remember water was supposed to work as the coolant
A positive feedback loop was created here
As the water turned into steam
it couldnt act as the coolant
resulting in the reaction gaining more speed
A fun fact here
to avoid this positive feedback loop
in the presentday nuclear reactors
water is used as a coolant and as a moderator both
So even if the amount of water decreases
the moderator will also decrease
so this will be the same as taking your foot off of the accelerator
And it would result in a negative feedback loop
But in this RBMK reactor graphite was the moderator
and the water was turning into steam rapidly
The Xenon present in the reactor till then
which was working to slow down the reaction
burned out when the reaction sped up
So there were no more Xenons to absorb the neutrons
This was the point of Extreme Power Surge
The speed of the nuclear reaction increased exponentially
A lot of steam was being produced here
and the lid of the containment structure
started shaking
Shockwaves were felt throughout the building
Workers realised that they have to execute an emergency stop
So they pressed the Emergency Stop button
It was at 0123 AM
Pressing this button meant that
the control rods would be reinserted into the reactor
to slow down the reaction
At a glance it would feel like a logical step
since our car is going at a high speed
we need to slam the brakes to slow it down
But there was a design flaw in this reactor
A design flaw related to the control rods
A control rod is actually made up of two parts
The main part of the control rod is made of Boron
it slows down the reaction by absorbing the Neutrons
But the tip of the control rods
were made of graphite
The same graphite that was used as a moderator in the reaction
That worked by speeding up the reaction
As soon as the button was pressed
and the remaining control rods were inserted into the reactor
the control rods with their graphite tips
This caused a blast
The graphite infinitely sped up the already speeding reaction
The power generation of the reactor reached 33000 MW
The first blast was 6 to 8 seconds after the emergency button was pressed
Because of this blast the core of the reactor started melting
After 23 seconds
there was an even more powerful blast
The 1000tonne lid on top of the structure
was blown into the air
The radioactive material started spreading through the atmosphere
The reason behind the second blast is said to be
the graphite present in the reactor started burning
It combusted as well
Two people were instantly killed in this blast
But more than 100 radioactive elements and 5 Uranium fuel
there were 192 tonnes of Uranium fuel in the reactor
went into the atmosphere
At 0126 AM the fire alarm began ringing
Firefighters reached the spot
Initially the firefighters didnt have an idea of what was happening there
When they reached the place
they assumed it was a normal fire
and started trying to put it out with water
But this fire was caused due to graphite
It wasnt about to die down easily
It took more than 10 days to put out this fire
Helicopters were called in to drop
thousands of tonnes of clay sand Boron and lead from the sky
These elements can reduce the spread of radiation
But it was extremely difficult to do this
Because to drop the elements on the fire
the helicopter would need to fly right on top of it
A truly dangerous task
One of the helicopters crashed due to this
Killing four people
The firefighters who had reached to put out the fire
experienced fatigue and nauseous after they went home
Symptoms of Radiation Sickness
When you are exposed to an extreme high dose of radiation
these symptoms begin appearing indicating that
you will die in a few months
The thing about radiation is that
the more you are exposed to radiation
the deadlier it is
About 28 of these firefighters passed away within a few months
People who were exposed to comparatively less radiation
died in a couple of years
and those who were exposed even less
developed diseases like cancer within 10 years
Coming back to the reactor the fire had died down after 10 days
But this reactor was producing high levels of heat even after the fire died down
It couldnt be controlled
Due to this heat the base of the reactor started cracking
It was highly problematic
Because there was a water tank under the reactor
Filled with radioactive water
If the reactor producing high levels of heat
came in contact with the water
the water would have instantly converted into steam
When temperatures are so high
that water is instantly converted into steam
this leads to an explosion
If youd recall your Chemistry lessons
liquids occupy lesser space than gas
Since the atoms are more spread out when in a gaseous form
They require more space
When the water converts into steam suddenly
there is often no space for the steam to exit
Because there isnt one it leads to an explosion
They were wary of a third blast
One thatd be bigger than the previous two
This blast would mean even more radioactive material being spread
There was only one way to prevent this from happening
A person had to dive into the radioactive water tank
and drain the radioactive water out of the reactor
To do this a reallife hero was needed
The water was radioactive
Anyone diving into the water
would be in a danger throughout their remaining life
They may die within a few years
Or even within a few months
They had to literally risk their lives to carry out the task
We had three such heroes
On 4th May 1986
wearing simple diving equipment
they dived into the water tank
They swam in the dark guided by only one lamp
They located the valves that had to be opened
to drain the water
These three heroes are so important in our story that youd find it difficult to believe
Because it is said that had the third explosion taken place
it wouldve been so dangerous that it might have killed millions of people
For the next 500000 years
almost the entirety of the European continent wouldve become uninhabitable
The good news is that all three divers survived
Boris passed away in 2005 due to a heart attack
Alexei and Valeri are still alive
Once this risk was dealt with
the next step was to clean up the radioactive waste lying there
Initially the officers of the Soviet Union used remotecontrolled robots to do this
But the robots started breaking down near the radioactive waste
Thousands of people had to be sent in to clean up
They were known as the liquidators
During 19861987
200000 liquidators were dispatched to actively clean up this area
When the fire caused by the blast was being put out
The Soviet Union government tried to cover up the whole incident
The Cold War was underway
So the Soviet Union didnt want the world to know what had transpired there
But it is something that couldnt be hushed up for long
Because the radioactive dust
had reached all the way to Sweden
Swedish monitoring stations detected that
the levels of radioactivity were unreasonably high
They carried out an analysis of the direction of the wind
and estimated the source of it
This forced the Soviet authorities to put the information about the disaster to the public
On 28th April 1986
the Soviet Union admitted that a disaster had indeed taken place
Two days after the actual disaster
The people living around this power plant
were told about what had happened after quite some time
This is another event for which the Soviet government is blamed
By 2nd May 1986
a 30 km radius was set up all around this nuclear power plant
It was declared an exclusion zone
This became a restricted area where no one could enter
except for scientists and government officials
To contain the radioactive waste
another structure was built on top of it
known as the Sarcophagus
It was completed by November 1986
a concrete and metal structure
to control the radiation coming off of it
But this structure wasnt built for the long term
About 28 years after it was constructed rust and cracks started forming
This is why in 2010
the construction of the new safe confinement began
This new structure was fit atop the existing sarcophagus
3 billion dollars were spent on building this new structure
It took 9 years to build it
Being completed only in 2019
But since it was built with a plan for the long term
it is said that this can keep the reactor closed off for the next 100 years
In 2018 the United Nations Scientific Community reported that
20000 cases of thyroid cancer were seen in children below the age of 18 years
Who lived through the disaster
The main reason for this is said to be
the radioactive dust settling on the grass
on the pastures where cattle were fed
After the cows ate the grass
their milk contained a high level of Iodine 131
It gets absorbed in our thyroid gland
leading to thyroid cancer in children
The trees around this area
had a red gingercoloured tint to them
This led to the area being called the Red Forest
In terms of the economics of it
the cost of the disaster to the Soviet Union
235 billion
Can you imagine how much money it is?
Emergency response cleaning up
relocating people paying the expenses of the survivors
carrying out evacuations and decontamination of the environment
they had to bear all expenses
Politically it is said to be a major reason
for the breakdown of the Soviet Union
Scientists all around the world started conducting research
on preventing such future nuclear disasters
As a direct result of this disaster
the World Association of Nuclear Operators was founded in 1989
The aim of this international organisation was to
conduct safety checks of all the nuclear power plants in the world
And to conduct research into how their safety can be further increased
I already mentioned one of its examples
how the presentday nuclear reactors
use water as the Moderator as well as the Coolant
In order to prevent any positive feedback loop
Even though there were high levels of radiation in this area
the remaining parts of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant
continued to be in operation until the year 2000
To meet the power needs of Ukraine
After that this power station was slated to be dismantled
And the process of doing so continues even now
It is expected that by 2028
this process would end
About 2400 people work in this plant now
Either they work as the guards
to defend the exclusion zone
or they are the firefighters scientists
technicians or service staff
Because the radiation levels are so high there
they work only 2 shifts a week
And they are regularly monitored to check the levels of radiation absorbed by them
The area around the plant
in the 30 km exclusion zone
has been completely abandoned by humans
Before the war began tourist groups did go to that zone
but more or less the area has been taken over by nature
Big animals like wolves deers lynx
beavers eagles boars and bears are found in this area
Some of these animals are even endangered
But they have a thriving population here
because of the lack of humans
Radiation has indeed affected some animals
and deformities have been spotted
but for the most part
there wasnt a major impact of the radiation on the animals
Friends this was the story of the Worlds Worst Nuclear Disaster
