Hello friends!
Today China is one of the most powerful countries in the world
But can you imagine that only 40 years ago
the poverty rate in this country was over 90?
Poverty and starvation had made the country miserable
But in the next 30 years
we saw such a huge transformation
that the poor starving country reached thus far
In 1978 Chinas contribution to the global GDP
was only 2
Today China contributes more than 18 to the global GDP
Their poverty rate is less than 1
and China is the secondlargest economy in the world
In many ways it can be considered a superpower country
But how was this possible?
What was the magic they used?
Come in this video lets do a detailed case study on China
China was emerging from its cultural revolution
as one of the worlds poorest nations
1978 Deng Xiaoping had an idea
one that would turn Communist China on its head
Since then China has made
enormous strides in various fields
So how did one of the worlds poorest countries
become a global superpower
in just 4 decades?
China is named after the Chinese word Qin
It is written as QIN
but pronounced as Chin
Qin was the name of an old dynasty
which ruled China 2000 years ago
and unified China
This is why we refer to Chinese people
as Chini in Hindi
What came from Chin is Chini
And another interesting fact here about
the actual Chini the Hindi name for white refined sugar
It is believed that refined white sugar
was brought to India by a Chinese man
A Chinese man either opened a sugar mill
or somehow sugar came from the Chinese route
Before that we used unrefined sugar and jaggery
Because a Chini person brought sugar
we started calling the sugar Chini
Another interesting fact here is that
Chinese people do not refer to their country as China
They use the name Zhongguo for their country
It means the Middle Kingdom
It symbolizes Chinas 4000 years old history
How China used to be the centre of the world
It was in the middle
You can see on the map
China is the worlds 4th largest country
It borders India
But most of the Chinese population
actually lives quite far from India on the East Coast
This is because the fertile land on which agriculture is possible
is mostly situated in that area
In the West there are the Himalayan mountains and deserts
Because of its size China used to be a very successful
and powerful kingdom till the 19th century
And after that it was affected by colonialism
Although the British could not fully occupy China
as they did on the Indian subcontinent
but still China was looted in different ways
This is the reason why
the period from 1839 to 1949 is remembered
as the Century of Humiliation by the Chinese
It starts in 1839 when the British East India Company
began exporting opium to China
Opium is a drug to which many Chinese people got heavily addicted
and the entire Chinese society was destroyed
After this many treaties were forced upon China
per which China had to hand over
significant portions of land and its ports to the British
Then in 1850 there was a terrible civil war in China
called the Taiping Rebellion
Millions of people were killed
Fast forward 40 years
and you see the first SinoJapanese War in 1894
China and Japan went to war over territory
I wont go into the details
but the Qing Dynasty was ruling China at that time
Dont confuse it with the Qin dynasty
the root of the name China
That Qin dynasty is 2000 years old
This was the QING dynasty
The other was the QIN dynasty
Same pronunciation
From 1937 to 1945
Chinese people had to endure even more terrible torture
This time by the hands of Japanese colonisers
In the World War 2 video
I explained how China was a part of the Allied Powers
It was fighting against Japan
In World War 2 around 30 million Chinese were killed
In the midst of all this a ray of hope was seen when
China and the Allied Forces finally won World War II
Japan retreated
But right after the end of WWII
a civil war broke out in China
A war between the Chinese Communist Party and the Nationalist Party KMT
It started in 1927
but when Japan invaded during World War II
they had stopped fighting temporarily
The civil war ended in 1949
with the victory of the Chinese Communist Party
The people of the Nationalist Party
fled to a nearby island
which is now called Taiwan
And the mainland China
was ruled by Mao Zedong
This was the point where it can be said that
China was formed as the country we now know
1st October 1949
Peoples Republic of China was born
The leader of the Communists
and the hero of the revolution
is Mao Zedong
In 1958 Mao launched
the Great Leap Forward Campaign
Its aim was to bring economic
and social transformation to the country
There were two main policies in this
First to take the land from the landowners
and distribute it among the farmers
Land redistribution
Thereafter collectivizing agriculture
Agricultural cooperatives were made so that
more farmers could work on the same land
But ultimately the ownership of the land
was in the hands of the government
Second industrialization
On the one hand large industrial plants were built for steel production
And on the other hand telling people to make
smallscale steel furnaces in their backyards
to produce steel at a local level
The intention was good
To develop the country economically
But the result was very bad
The smallscale steel furnaces that people had built in their gardens
were producing lowquality steel
This led to the resources being wasted
Secondly the farmers did not have
any incentive to increase their production
because there was no profit sharing
and no private ownership
The ownership of the land was ultimately
in the hands of the government
So whatever crop was being grown by the farmers
had to be handed over to the government
This led to a huge decline in productivity
Between 1958 and 1961
the grain production fell by 15
In just a few years due to bad weather and
some other masterstroke policies of the Mao regime
the situation got so bad that the whole country was starving
The famine was so terrible that
around 2040 million people died in this famine in China
It is known as one of the deadliest famines in history
To put it bluntly Mao Zedong was a dictator
And because there is no checks and balances system for dictators
as there is in a democracy
dictators often have a habit of
imposing their wills without thinking or testing
Several such decisions by Mao made China worse
Another example of such decisions
was the Sparrow Extermination
Maos intention was to increase food production
So it was ordered that all the sparrows
and all the birds should be killed
because those birds ate the grains
They eat some crop grains from the fields
So the crops are affected by the crops
so all the birds in the country were to be exterminated
When this campaign was run and sparrows were killed
a few years later people realised that
the insects and pests were multiplying so rapidly
they were causing more damage to the crops
This worsened the food shortage
Later a scientist found that if all the birds are killed
then no one would be left to eat those insects
The birds used to eat the insects
which kept the insect population in control
The entire ecological balance was disturbed
And the situation worsened so terribly that it led to a famine
After such a big failure Mao was criticized
by the Chinese public and by the Communist Party too
But Mao Zedong was not willing to admit his mistake
Another campaign was started
Cultural Revolution in 1966
The name suggests that it was meant to
bring a revolution of culture in the country
but the real purpose was
to give control to Mao and suppress the opposition
Propaganda and PR machinery were used extensively here
To show off his power Mao swam in the Yangtze River
There is a famous photo of him
A civilian army is formed by the students
the Red Guards
Red Guards were loyal soldiers of Mao who had
red armbands on their hands
and they used to carry a small red book by Mao
Their job was to target those who were against Mao
Intellectuals party officials all those who were not loyal to Maos ideology
were targeted publicly humiliated
and often violence against them was also seen
There were people in the Communist Party who
were criticizing the Cultural Revolution
criticizing Mao
and they were also targeted by the Red Guards
Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping
were some of the highranking party officials
targeted by the Red Guards
In the name of this revolution a fear environment was created in the whole country
People were encouraged to spy on their neighbours family members
to find the traitors
a traitor was someone who was against Maos ideology
people had to find them and report about them
Schools and universities were shut down
Students were told to go to the farms and
learn the condition of the farmers
To experience the hardships of rural life
As time passed things became out of control
Red Guards started fighting among themselves
Historical sites and cultural artifacts were destroyed
Peoples lives were turned upside down
This was the time when Tibetans were also tortured
I have told you the story in the Dalai Lama video
If you havent seen it I will put the link in the description below
Finally Mao realized
the Cultural Revolution
created a crisis in the country
It was dividing the country
So in 1968 to regain control
the Red Guards system was abolished
The estimates vary a lot depending upon the source
but it is said that hundreds of thousands to 2 million people
lost their lives because of the Cultural Revolution
In total it is said that up to 50 million people
died in China because of Maos policies
In 1976 Mao Zedong passed away due to poor health
And till then there were no major improvements to Chinas condition
But it is not that there were only failures and bad things
during Maos reign
There were some positive achievements too
Especially in terms of womens equality and education
A nationwide public education system was launched during Maos rule
Campaigns were run by the government to end illiteracy
And during Maos leadership
Chinas literacy rate improved a lot
In 1978 compared to 1949
China had 3 times more primary and secondary schools
At the same time a strong foundation was formed
with the help of which China helped millions of people to get out of poverty
Moving forward as you will see in the story
his government made strategic investments
in education in the fields of science technology engineering and mathematics
which are called STEM fields
With the help of this a talent pool was created in the country
which led the countrys technological progress

And now lets get back to the topic of the video
Maos opinion about women was that
Women hold up half the sky
In 1950 a new marriage law was passed according
to which arranged marriages and forced marriages
were made illegal across the country
Women were given the right to divorce and
in many other aspects women were brought on equal footing
But if we come back to the time of 1976
a new leader comes to power after Maos death in China
in the Chinese Communist Party
Deng Xiaoping
He is also called the father of modern China
because during his leadership
the real transformation of China begins
Deng Xiaoping was one of those who raised
his voice against Mao during Maos time
Because of this during the Cultural Revolution
he was forced to resign from all his positions
It was obvious that Deng Xiaopings ideology
was very different from Maos ideology
Deng believed that the government had extremely tight control
over the Chinese economy
Which was the cause of the destruction of China over the preceding 50 years
He wanted to free the economy
Thats why he introduced his policies of Economic Liberalization
There are many aspects to this
which we will discuss one by one
But his overall ideology is today known as
Socialism with Chinese Characteristics
First to bring transformation in the agriculture system
Deng introduced a household responsibility system
When Mao launched his Great Leap Forward campaign
private farming was completely abolished
No individual was allowed to own land
All ownership was in the hands of the government at the local level
Deng did not change this ownership structure
The ownership remained in the hands of the government of the village
But individual farmers and their families
were given the land on longterm leases
Those farmers will have the right to decide
which crops to grow
how to manage their business
and from where to earn profit
So the farmers got more freedom to grow crops of their choosing
Second Deng said that all farmers will have
to sell a certain amount of their crops to the government
But after meeting that quota
they can sell the excess produce wherever they want
and earn extra profit
So this motivated the farmers to innovate
Their productivity increased
Some similar land reforms
were brought in India after Independence
in states like Kerala and West Bengal
which are said to be major reasons
why states like Kerala have been able to develop so much
Although the specifics of these reforms were different
We can discuss them in another video
But Deng Xiaoping used the same idea on factories
Factory Manager Responsibility System was introduced
Before this during Maos leadership
the responsibility to manage the industrial factories in China
were given to the members of the Communists Party
There was a lot of political interference
But under Dengs leadership the responsibility
was shifted to the workers and managers working in the factories
They allowed them more freedom to decide what
they want to produce their production target
the prices at which they will sell the products
and the salaries they would draw
Once again the workers working in the factory
got an incentive to work harder
Imagine it for yourself there is a factory that
manufactures shoes for example
Now the workers and managers working in the factory
have the right to decide
the number of shoes to be produced materials to be used
the selling prices of the shoes and the salaries paid to them
The workers developed a sense of ownership
and accountability
It was their factory and they could make it successful if they wanted to
During Maos leadership there was a lot of centralised planning
A person sitting on top dictating everything
How everything should be running
The government decided everything
Everything that happened or did not happen
But during the time of Deng there was decentralization
More freedom was given in the economic sense
Because of all these policy measures
millions of people started coming out of poverty and
peoples lives started changing
Between 1978 and 1984
on average agriculture output in China
increased at the rate of 74
The grain production in China
doubled between the late 1970s and mid1980s
The next big step was to bring about a revolution in education
To focus on educating people
Because of this in 1986
a compulsory education law was introduced by the government
For 9 years free and compulsory education for every child in China
Compare this to India
The Right to Education Act was introduced in India after so many years
In 2009
On top of that there was no standstill in China after the law was passed
The government started spending more on peoples education consistently
In 1980 the money spent by the government on education
was approximately 2 of GDP in China
And it kept increasing
By 2010 it reached 41 of GDP
Compare it with India
According to the latest figure in India
our government has spent 29 of the Indian GDP on education
Not only that China has also focused on technical and vocational education
People were taught the skills
that are actually needed in jobs
Friends if you have seen my Singapore video
you might be thinking that these actions sound familiar
Because it is friends
All the developed countries
have focused heavily on education
And they are developed because
education was given such a big priority
Because of all these measures
we saw an amazing improvement in the literacy rate in China
In 1982 it was at 65
and in 2012 it crossed 95
For comparison Indias total literacy rate is still at 77
Similarly spending money on healthcare is another big indicator
In 2021 China spent 559 of GDP on its health
And India according to the 2020 data spent around 296
The next development strategy of Deng Xiaoping
was Township and Village Enterprises
also known as TVEs
This is quite similar to the cooperative model of India in many ways
Cooperatives are usually owned in India by
the workers working in the cooperatives
but on the other hand the ownership of TVEs
are held by townships and villages
Both have the same purpose
to bring economic growth in rural areas
and to improve peoples living standards
In India we have seen cooperatives mostly
in the agricultural and dairy sectors like Amul
but TVEs have been seen in almost every sector in China
Textiles electronics manufacturing services
In fact a big example of TVE is Huawei Technologies
This company started as a TVE in the area of Shenzhen
But today it has become a global leader
in telecommunications equipment
Another good example of this is the city of Wenzhou China
Here some local people established small factories to make shoes
Slowly it expanded
and became so big that
today the shoe industry of Wenzhou
is a major export sector in China
The shoes made here are not only sold in China
but are also sold outside of China
By the early 1990s TVE was employing around
100 million people in China
Peoples living standards started to increase
Usually there is an income gap in rural and urban areas
But here this income gap reduced because of TVEs
About 20 of Chinas total industrial output
was from TVEs in the 1990s
Millions of jobs were generated because of this
But this could only happen when people were
already educated and skilled to do all this
In 1980 Deng set up special economic zones in China
in which tax incentives were given
the bureaucratic process was made easier
fewer regulations were imposed
so that foreign investment could flow into the country
Many times when people tell the story of Chinas development
they mention this point first
But I am mentioning this point later because
to reach this point
China had to take many other steps
to make this possible
to bring in foreign investment successfully
When foreign companies invest in the country
they need skilled people
If people are not educated and skilled no one will invest money
Here the labour was cheap people were skilled
only a little bureaucracy
and people already had the experience required because of TVEs
Shenzhen became the first Special Economic Zone in China
This city used to be a small fishing village
but in a few years it became a major international metropolis
In 1980 Shenzhens GDP was 03 billion dollars
By 2020 it reached 420 billion dollars
To encourage foreign companies to come to the country
an opendoor policy was made
Chinas economy was open to the world
This is called economic liberalization
It was done in China in 1978
And in India Economic liberalization was seen later in 1991
We are in a phase of restructuring our economy
that our country is unable to launch
a certain industrial revolution
a certain agricultural revolution
that our country is unable to integrate itself
into the world economy
in a manner in which we can take advantage of the opportunities
offered by the new global economy
Because of this many multinational companies
like Nike Apple Volkswagen
set up their manufacturing facilities in China
In 1980 Chinas FDI was 006 billion
In 2021 it exceeded 333 billion
Apart from all this the government also focused on infrastructure development
Railway lines were built good public transport in cities
And along with this the government made scientific research a priority
The Deng introduced a crash training program
for more than 800000 Chinese researchers
Priority areas were made
Energy production computers optics
space technology physics and genetics
These science research centers were given heavy funding by the government
The money spent on research and development
was gradually increased by the government
and in 2020 it crossed 500 billion
A big example of this
is the Zhongguancun Science Park in Beijing
built in 1988
It is a hub of technology and innovation
Many hightech companies research institutions
and universities are situated here
In 1990 India and China were almost on the same line
In fact if you look at GDP per capita
Indias GDP per capita was more than Chinas
1202 vs 983 for China
But their change was so remarkable that today
Chinas GDP per capita is more than three times that of Indias
According to the 2020 figures
Indias is 6454 and
China is at 17312
With regard to these revolutionary policies
Deng Xiaoping said that
he took the approach of crossing the river by feeling the stones
That we cross the river by evaluating at each and every stone
Every decision that was taken
was taken in a pragmatic and practical manner
After a lot of thought
It is not that a dictator had an abrupt idea
of what could be done to change the country
And without any further thought or consultations with advisors
the Dictator imposed his decision
We learn from Deng Xiaoping that how bringing reforms
is a gradual process
that should be undertaken after thorough evaluations
It should be tested at every step
and the policies should be adjusted as needed
It is not that Deng Xiaoping was
a perfect hero in our story
Or that he did not do anything wrong
Economically his ideology did favour freedom
but politically he was still a dictator
It was during his reign that in 1989
the Tiananmen Square massacre took place
One thing that was ignored in all these policies
was the environment
What effect did it have on the ecology?
And the authoritarianism that continued during Deng Xiaopings reign
resulted in the presentday conditions under Xi Jinpings rule
Had Deng Xiaoping wanted
he could have transitioned China into a democracy
But he didnt
For this reason today a dictator emerged
who again runs his own will
and imposes decisions without thinking twice
This is the reason why during the pandemic in 2020
China saw many scary lockdowns
Restrictions are being imposed on peoples freedom once again
