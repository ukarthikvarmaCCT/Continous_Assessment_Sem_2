I just bought this train
and it is currently barreling fullspeed
towards that giant pit over there
Were also crashing countless cars
blowing up thousands of sticks of real dynamite
and even putting 10 jet engines on a car
Just to show you the most insane experiments of all time
Starting with filling a house with over 100000 fireworks
Please do not try this in your house
For this experiment
each of the boys will hide a dummy in my new house
to see if its even possible to survive
Water and fire dont mix
my mannequin is going to survive
Mines in the fridge
Go in come on
Lets blow this house up
Hey be careful
If you accidentally press one the house explodes
Oh my goodness  Please
Wheres your mannequin?
Bathtub  Fridge
Under the washer
Tareq?  Front porch
Oh yeah its sitting right there
This is gonna be the coolest thing
you have ever seen in your life!
Yes! 5 4 3 2 1
Fire in the hole!
Oh my God!
What happened to the house?
I cant even see it anymore
Oh my god!
I dont think our mannequins
are gonna make it
The house burned all night
until there was literally nothing left
including all the mannequins
Next experiment
Were about to play TugofWar
between this real military tank
and these two school buses
And the loser gets dragged into the pit
Theres no way the tank loses
Were probably gonna lose
No were not
Now obviously people cant be in these vehicles
cause theyll die when they fall in the pit
So this remote actually controls the tank
This feels illegal
3 2 1 Go!
Im full throttled right now
Youre done for!
Oh!  Oh were screwed
The buses are done for
Oh my god
Oh my god!
Oh my god!
Do you hear the buses beeping?
Its horns going off
Were gonna go investigate the bottom of the pit
to see the buses
Oh god  Oh no
I need to stop looking down this is
Stop moving!  Im not moving!
Were in the pit
Oh my gosh Bro look at that
Whyd the bus think it could beat the tank?
I dont think it did
Later in this video
a trains gonna come off those tracks
and land right about there
But before we do that this is 50000
and it is surrounded by thousands of pounds of TNT
And this is Will
Whats up guys?
See that crate in the field?  Yeah
Oh man
That is around 1 of the explosives
surrounding this money
Are we safe standing here?
Uh yeah youll be fine
Heres my credit card
Spend as much money as you want to protect this 50 grand
I dont care if you use wood bricks
or even steel to protect this money
Whatevers left of this 50 grand
when that TNT blows up you keep
Good luck building walls
All right lets make 50000!
I dont think he stands a chance
The first thing Will did
was buy 12 industrial water containers
and filled them with 20000 pounds of water
Im really worried that Jimmys TNT
is gonna get through this
And he should be
because this isnt even close to enough to stop the TNT
Meanwhile were gonna test another experiment
In a previous video we put a jet engine on a car
and it jumped eight buses
So this time we put 10 jet engines on the car
and were to see if it flies 10 times further
When this car flies off this ramp
I think its gonna go past all the buses into the trees
I think its gonna hit the first bus
Our guesses couldnt be further apart
Hes currently matrixed into the car
so he sees what the car sees
Chris!  Hey!
Oh should we move?
Yeah were sending a rocket car
Oh okay
3 2 1
Send the jet car!
The cars coming straight at us
I lost signal
Maybe we should jump?
Now Im straightening it
Oh my god!
Yeah!  What the heck?
Whoa! Wait wait
We broke the ramp!
I think it was a success  Yes
The jet car easily cleared all 12 buses
and literally left a crater in the road
I love how this block of engines
just on the road
Yeah its still smoking
Oh its leaking  Oh and its smoking
And now were back at the giant pit
If you jump in this deep pit
and land on a thousand bouncy balls
would you die?
Id love to know Nolan catch!
Catch what? What are we doing?
You completely missed!
Luckily we have more mannequins
Will it survive?
Pay attention!
Oh Oh!
Oh buckets!
Hey Jimmy!
What if we dropped the car in it?
I think you know whats about to happen
Clearly that mannequin didnt survive
Next bit
Meanwhile Will was desperately trying
to protect his 50000
Hes honestly taken this way more seriously
than I thought he would
In the past four days Ive hired some professionals
and weve already built the cinder block wall
filled it with matches
and were already on our second cinder block wall
This dynamite is not getting through
You blew my expectations outta the water
How about this?
If you let me double the TNT Ill double the money
So a hundred grand double the TNT
Yeah but if it blows it up you get nothing
Take the deal! Take the deal!
Okay! Okay!  Its a deal baby! Deal baby!
And while he kept working the boys and I went bowling
And the bowling balls are these cars
Im ready to see some destruction
Lets see if I get a strike
Hey first bowl a strike
Oh its not going straight
Oh its coming in our direction
We should move We should move
We should move  Nolan watch out!
Oh into the field There it goes
Oh its turning around
Oh its coming back!
Oh God  Its coming back
The cars got a mind of its own!
Its coming back!
Take number two
Oh thats a perfect strike
Whoa!  Lets go!
I love cars hitting things!
And if youre wondering
the other car is still going in circles
During this bit me and the boys
have been wearing some brand new designs
which you can now buy on our new store
3 2 1
We switched from ShopMrBeastcom which was very long
Move over! Move over!
to MrBeaststore
Oh my gosh!
Ooh!  No way!
We just about died
Im gonna show you how to just hit a full strike easily
All right Here comes a strike baby
A store domain is the perfect choice
for anyone looking to sell anything online
That was the worst throw yet
That was the best throw yet!
That was awesome!
If youre looking to set up a store
it should be at store domain
so your customers clearly know that your website is a store
This is Carls car
Unlike com MrBeaststore tells the world
that the website is my store
Dont forget to head to MrBeaststore
and buy our brand new merch right now
Since I doubled Wills money and TNT
hes completed a sevenlayer fortress
of 20000 pounds of water mattresses
a cinder block wall four mattresses
a second cinder block wall
an additional 32000 pounds of water
all packed in with a final wall of dirt
But I actually have another layer
that Jimmy knows nothing about
Jimmy will never see this one coming
Hey Jimmy!
How am I supposed to blow up Feastables?
Thats the point
And with the TNT doubled
its time to put Wills bunker to the test
I also brought number 40 from 1 throughout 100 back
to help us blow up all this TNT
Youre in charge of the button
Dont press anything yet
Oh god
Moment of truth
Whenever youre ready press the one
Im nervous
Oh my god!
Oh that moneys gone for sure
Oh my god!
Bro look at that smoke cloud!
I cant even see anything Is it okay?
Wait I think I see money falling from the sky
Seven days of work just went up in flames
I dont know if Ive got this
I gotta see if my moneys okay!
Why are we running?
Im running cause hes running
Oh my goodness!
Oh theres so many stacks!
We counted out the money
and over 95000 survived the explosion
I just won 95000!
Congrats on the 95 grand
Lets go see what happens if you drive a train into a pit!
Yeah!  Whoo!
And nows the moment youve all been waiting for
a train is gonna go fullspeed down those tracks
into this giant pit
If you were on this train where would you sit?
I put my mannequin in the cabin
Statistically the safest place to be on a train
All right you got this
All right were gonna sit him right on the front
Youre not going anywhere
Were gonna give the Feastables bar a front row seat
Stop eating Hersheys Eat Feastables
We have waited our entire lives for this moment
This is going to be epic
Nolan send the train!
The trains coming!
Lets do this!
Oh my god Here it goes!
Oh my god here it comes!
Oh my god!
Whoa! Look at that!
That might have been the coolest thing
Ive ever seen in my life
Are you kidding me?
Yeah my mannequin didnt survive
Train versus pit the pit won
I hope you enjoyed the video
Lets end it with an explosion
That is so hot!
Mr Beast
