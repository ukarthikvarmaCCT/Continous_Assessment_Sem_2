Saf here on SuperSaf TV
And its the one youve all been waiting for
the endofyear SuperSafStyle collaboration
where we find out which 2023 smartphones
some of your favorite YouTubers choose to use
and are taking with them to 2024
Now as always there will be two parts to this video
In this video we will be looking at just smartphones
But in the next video
well have a bit of a rewind
and look at the best tech of 2023
not including smartphones
If you want to be one of the first to see that
then be sure to subscribe and hit that bell icon
so you dont miss it
Right to kick things off
which smartphone do I choose to use?
Well I have two sim cards
one in an iPhone and one in an Android phone
The iPhone its very very simple
Its the big one its the iPhone 15 Pro Max
For me
this still has the best and most consistent camera package
for photos and videos
Performance has been great with the A17 Pro
Excellent battery life
and finally finally USB type C
so I dont have to carry around multiple cables
especially with my Android smartphones
And now my Android smartphone does change
throughout the year
depending on what Im reviewing
But the device that my sim card keeps going back into
was actually one that released early in the year
and that is of course the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra
Now yes it looks just like the S22 Ultra
But the fact that it still holds up almost a year on
is a testament to how good it is
Its a great allrounder with excellent cameras
The best extended zoom on any smartphone
And this year we had the 8 Gen 2 across the board
no split between Qualcomm and Exynos
Thats me lets see what the others have chosen
Whats up guys?
This is Austin Evans on SuperSaf TV
My favorite smartphone of this year
is a really clear and obvious choice
You saw it a mile away
Its the iPhone 15 Pro
Honestly this phone is incredibly solid
in every possible way
I mean that
Not only is the build quality terrific
we finally got USBC
And for me I spend a lot of time using this
as my main shooter
not only for photos but also for video
And the fact that I can walk into an event
or pretty much anywhere Im going with just this phone
and capture all the content I need is such a game changer
The iPhone have always been good for video
but the screen the performance
like theres basically nothing I can really complain about
with this
and that is an incredibly impressive thing
So I love the Z Flip
but honestly the iPhones beginning
to become my main gadget like period right now
Whats up guys?
This is Michael Fisher on SuperSaf TV
Saf you ever think of doing this roundup at a time of year
when Im not utterly fried and completely insane
with exhaustion?
What smartphone do I use?
All of them
But hinges are preferred
and in that category
the OnePlus Open is the one I would choose
if you made me pick just one in the largeformat category
And in the flipphoneclamshell category
the Motorola Razr Plus
or on your side of the ocean the Razr 40 Ultra I think
Thats what the thing is the nicer one the red one
the leather one
And I carry them together
because Im just that perverted
And I dont have either one with me right now
because Im using other phones I would rather not use
so I can do my job
Thanks for the shade by the way
Whats up guys?
This is Gaurav aka Technical Guruji on SuperSaf TV
And my pick for this years smartphone is this
the all new Samsung Galaxy Z Flip5
especially in this new bespoke yellow color option
Now this phone is quite an improvement from the last years
because now what we have is a full immersive screen
on the outside
capable of running almost any app that you want
The phone feels fresh
Now with the zerogap hinge
I mean the form factor is quite improved
And considering its a small tiny phone
good for all the fun good for all the eyeballs
And I mean this is my pick for this year
the all new Samsung Galaxy Z Flip5
Whats up guys?
Its Jaime Rivera from Pocketnow here on SuperSaf TV
It has been a great year for phones
but if I had to pick only one
it would be the iPhone 15 Pro Max
Sure its got the looks
new materials and more powerful telephoto
but what Ive liked most is performance
Ive used iPhones for years as a Bcamera
but LOG video combined with that Blackmagic Camera app
has made me a believer in a phone becoming my Acamera
at some point
Same thing with gaming
where the words console quality
have been tossed around a lot with smartphones
But this is the first phone to actually pull it off
I think the word Pro fits the name now more than ever
Saf again thank you so much for having me
Super SuperSafilicious
Hey guys this is Colonel Singala here for SuperSaf TV
and welcome to my favorite smartphone of 2024
Its the OnePlus Open and close
Open and close is back
Yes the OnePlus Open
this is the most freshest phone ever
Because you know what?
I can open and close
plus we have that very sexy camera bump
and this very nice display of faux leather made from petrol
I love petrol
Anyway this phone is smooth its vibrant
big screen great camera great for multitasking
so I can indistinct and enjoy myself
So Colonel Singala signing out
open and close
Colonel Singala laughs
Take it!
Hi Im Michael Josh your gadget matchmaker
on SuperSaf TV
You know I love my iPhone
And for most of this year
Ive been rocking the iPhone 14 Pro Max
Of course last September after the iPhone event
I switched to the 15 Pro Max in natural titanium
The cameras on this phone are excellent
but I especially love this brushed titanium finish
Its lightweight and even matches my Oura Ring
and Apple Watch Ultra 2 with my titanium strap from Nomad
Hey there guys its Mr Q from Raqami tv here
on SuperSaf TV
Another year another wrinkle
You see Im a big fan of the Samsung Fold5
However this has taken over
This is the OPPO Find N3
You see I love how slim this is
I love the sharp edges
just the flat surface is really awesome
Its got a really lovely screen as well
Plus of course open it up
and then you can see that splash in your face
Guys the software on this is pretty awesome
when it comes to multitasking
I can go ahead and just open up loads of different apps
at the same time
and see them basically full screen
And its cheaper than the Fold5
Now when it comes to an iOS device
obviously were going to have to choose this
the iPhone 15 Pro
Not the Pro Max
because Im actually Team Mini
This is a pretty nice phone
First of all the titanium little rounded edges
just feel really nice to hold in the hand
It definitely feels lighter as well
Also dont forget that weve got USBC
which means that finally we can use one cable
to rule them all
Guys those are my two devices
Boom and boom!
All right?
Take care
air whooshing
And just as I was editing this video
we have hit 2 million subscribers
Thank you to everybody for subscribing
If you havent already do consider joining the 2 million
Lets get back to the video
Hey its Justine here on SuperSaf TV
So the phone that I have been using in 2023
other than my iPhone 15 Pro Max
yeah I know
I mean its still a surprise like Hi
I have an I in front of my name
I am who I am just let me be
the Pixel 8 Pro
I have been loving this phone so much
My sister and I actually did a really fun livestream review
with Google this year
So that was a lot of fun to do
But Ive really been loving the phone
Not only do I just love the color
but just this design
it just feels different it feels unique
And Ive always been a huge fan
of the way that the Pixels look
And of course its deep integration with Google
and all of the things that theyre doing
with their AI initiative
I am so here for it
Hey guys Ashwin from C4ETech on SuperSaf TV
and my favorite phone this year has got to be the Nubia Z50
Well technically it did launch five days before 2023
but I got it this year
and its the one that surprised me the most
An 8 Gen 2 for 300something dollars right around launch
I went in with very tempered expectations
but what I ended up getting
was a solid phone I enjoyed using
It even had a unique 35 millimeter equivalent lens
paired with a solid sensor
with good software a very ergonomic form factor
a faux leather back
that let you actually use the phone naked
I mean this phone the Nubia Z50
I feel its the perfect example
of a product punching way over its weight class
Whats up guys?
This is Jon Rettinger back on SuperSaf TV
Another year has gone by
and Im here to tell you what my favorite smartphone
that I used all year is
and its two phones
On one hand it is the iPhone 15 Pro Max
cause its the iPhone
the sort of the best of everything
But the other phone thats been in my pocket
since it came out
that I think is going to be my phone well into 2024
my sweet foldy boy the OnePlus Open
I love the aspect ratio
I love the screen love the technology
Its not perfect
but its really close
when it comes to the world of foldables
Whats up guys?
This is Jerry Rig on SuperSaf TV
And for the past 13 years Ive been an Android user
But I decided to give iPhone a chance
and I have been doing so for the past three months
However Im switching back to Android
Very long story short
I can get more done on Android with less taps
and I can schedule text messages on Android
which is important to me and not a feature the iPhone has
Whats up guys?
This is David on SuperSaf TV
And I dont really have a daily phone that I use
I try to switch into whatever phone
that Im doing a video on next
But I will say that one phone
that I keep thinking about wanting to use
is the Google Pixel Fold
Its shape just kind of reminds me
of a Moleskine notebook in the best way
And its just so nice to have Pixel cameras
and all that entails on a folding phone
Its something I feel like we all just have always wanted
if only the battery life didnt suck as much as it did
Maybe theyll do better with the next one
Hey guys Jenna Ezarik here on SuperSaf TV
And for my 2023 smartphones
Ive been rocking the iPhone 15 Pro Max in natural titanium
as well as the Google Pixel 8 Pro
I love having the fivetime telephoto
I love all of the AI features and best take on the Google
And Im always rocking an iPhone
So there you have it
Thats what Ive been rocking as my main devices in 2023
Whats up guys?
Im Tom The Tech Chap on SuperSaf TV
Now obviously theres been a ton of great phones this year
But for me what Ive been carrying in my pockets
well theres two
This guy this is the OnePlus Open
which I reckon is the best foldable phone
you can buy right now
I absolutely love this thing
And also the iPhone 15 Pro Max
which Im recording this on in 4K cinematic mode
I just wish there was a 4K 60 mode
so I can then slow it down afterwards
to get those nice slowmo shots
But yeah mostly for video and also the ecosystem
the iPhones been my main phone this year
Hey whats up?
MKBHD here on SuperSaf TV
So were talking smartphones
Favorite phone of the year for me
theres a lot to pick from
I think weve seen all of them come out by this point
And I think my favorite one is the one
that Im going back to daily driving
after testing all the other phones
which right now for me is the Pixel 8 Pro
Lot of software features on this one
Marques giggles
Its not really about the hardware
its got nice hardware too
But its so much software
to the point where if you live in a region
where not all of the software features are enabled
its a notably worse phone
But I live in a region
where I do have all the software features and theyre great
So I like this phone a lot
So there we have it
