This is 1 in penny This is 20
This is 100 in pennies
That is 1000 in pennies
This is 2000
This is 10000 in pennies
Give or take like five grand I stopped counting
And this is 20000 in pennies
Wait no its not
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Alright now its 20000
So this is 20000 in pennies
Were gonna take these 20000 worth of pennies
and empty em on the backyard
and Chandlers dad has no idea
so when he gets home
theres gonna be 20000 in pennies laying
across his entire backyard
And then were gonna help him pick up all the pennies
and go buy a car
cause as youre remember in the slime video
he said he needs a car
I bought six cars all for my kids
and Im the only one without a car now
So yeah guys lets spread the pennies across the yard
I cant wait to see his reaction
and I cant wait to buy the car
Alright were officially gonna start covering
your dads yard in pennies
How does that make you feel?
How do you think your dads gonna react?
I dont know honestly
Yeah? Alright
Whoa thats a whole lot of pennies
Flashback to Chandler doin that to Chris
Good luck
Actually no
There you go
We currently have seven people opening up rolls
and we have five more coming
But even once all 15 people arrive
if were all goin super hard
theres no way were even gonna do like 10 of that
by the time Chandlers dad gets home
Or maybe like 20 30
but were not gonna be able to do like majority of that
So me and Chris are gonna test some ways
to crack open these roles
because these are what are taking forever
Its just really time consuming
to bust them and get the pennies out of it
So were gonna try to find a more efficient way
because if we dont figure somethin out
I guess were just gonna have
to lay the rolls out in his backyard which is kinda lame
Itd be so much funnier if it was just the pennies
But I dont know were running out of time
So now were gonna see what happens
if we try to burn off the paper
Cause maybe we can just burn the paper off
this whole mound
Apparently you cant just burn the paper off
for whatever reason it doesnt burn
We got two hours left till his dad gets home
We wanted to cover the entire backyard in pennies
but theyre still wrapped up
What do we do?
Alright were really desperate
were gonna see if this works again
I think its just puttin the fire out
Are you tellin me firefighters should
just use pennies?
It looks like it man
Yeah youre definitely doin stuff there
Oh youre gettin em now
I think I am
How do we unravel all these pennies
before Chandlers dad gets home?
You havin fun?
No just tired  Im breakin em open
Were desperate
What would be good to mash
Ow that hit my  Hit that direction
Garretts first swing  Just straight
Ow my !
Fired it right at it
Yeah I got hit in the eye
How do you think I feel?
Feel like this isnt very effective
Now were gonna test the brick method
cause the golf club method isnt really working
I missed
Those look like the Ten Commandments
So I think at this rate well cover this whole yard
in about a week
Yeah unfortunately we only have
an hour and a half though
Next were gonna test the car method
Alright now lets see How easy are they?
Is that a good way to pop the tire actually?
Dude that tire looks a little more deflated
I got my secret weapon on my side now
Chandler what are you doin?
Almost helping
Remember that time when we threw a baseball bat at the car
and it almost killed Garrett?
Watch out  Oh
If we just had a bunch of pickaxes
this might actually work
Surprising my friends dad
with a lot of trash in his backyard
What do we do?
I wanna surprise your dad
with a bunch of pennies in his backyard
I dont know what to do
I dont either! Were almost outta time
Do we just leave em in the rolls?
Would that make our lives easier?
It would make our lives 1000 easier
But is that what were about?
Weve got that pile that pile
and then a couple in here
Its currently what 300?
We did this when we bought the car with pennies
and we knew this would take forever
But we did it anyway cause were absolute
Mad lads  mad lads
Yeah but how did we know this would take forever
and not realize it would take forever?
Sprinkler  Oh my god
I actually didnt get hit by anything
That all hit me right in the head
I didnt get hit
Put this in slowmo
So weve got a mini army over there bustin up the rolls
but I really dont think
were gonna open up all the rolls in time
His dads gonna be home in an hour what do we do Chris?
Even the greats fail sometimes
You think Michael Jordan hit every single dunk?
Yeah I guess youre right Yeah
I guess you just suck
Just so you guys understand
were tryin to put out multiple
really crazy videos every single week
Our videos are so crazy
that were working on so many different videos
at the same day so we can do at least two videos a week
I really wanna get all the pennies unrolled and laid out
but we just simply didnt have time
Theyre still gonna get the money
Theyre still gonna get the cars
The point Im trying to make is that
were just trying to film so many videos
that sometimes its hard for every video to be perfect
And also his dad gets home in an hour
so no matter what
Even if we didnt have videos
for the next four days  Yeah we gotta be done
within another hour
Stick to the end
so that way you can see the dealerships reaction
to the pennies
and what car Chandler and his dad decide to get
Can you go back to work?
Yeah yeah can you
We werent done
Dad you need MMs to go with them Cheerios
dont you?
Yeah  Whats up boy?
Oh my goodness
Aw he was ready
for another sandwich bro  He has it
You thought he was
I mean hes home
I guess we cant keep it a surprise anymore lets just
All right yeah come on  Come on
What do you do you think were doing at your house?
Theres 14 people in your backyard right now
what do you think theyre doing?
I thought yall was gonna put that slime thing over
Yeah we did
We did put the slime tank in the backyard
Im not gettin back in that
We just wanted to put it back there for fun
Come look at it Come on
Cant see right now  You cant see the slime tank
until you get closer
Three two one
What the man?
We were gonna put a bunch of pennies
in your backyard but we couldnt
You did  unroll them in time
So we were gonna take em back
but then you still came back
So now we dont know what to do
So theres a bunch of rolled up pennies in your backyard
I think we could just leave it here
for you right?
We dont have to clean em up anymore
You can take em to the bank for me
We were gonna unroll em all
and cover your entire backyard in pennies but
Apparently it takes a long time
It takes longer than 10 hours
Oh my god  which we didnt know
But you have a lot of pennies now
Oh I getta keep em?
Yeah  Were gonna get a car
With pennies?  With pennies yeah
It wouldve made so much more sense
They have pennies there?  if they were just laid out
This is a dollar
Ill make sure I get at least 1 outta this
5 bucks in a box right?  How many pennies do you
think were in your backyard?
Keep on goin  A little bit warmer
For real?
Yeah  Yeah
Theres 21000 here
We were gonna surprise you with them but
21000 worth of pennies?
Yessir  Yeah
We called the dealership
they said they would just take the pennies
Theyre gonna come get em?
No you load em up
and just go buy cars right now
Whatever you and Chandler want
For real?
Yeah Sure
yeah Dude thats awesome man
Hold up  The fact that
Awe Yeah look at that
There we go man

So I bet you didnt know havin a son

Finally paid off  Just have your son
work for a YouTuber
Right Yeah  Hey usually
havin a child is really expensive
You guys should have children
so they can become friends with YouTubers
so you can get cool stuff
Also both of you guys lost the slime video so this is
This is redemption  This was worth it
Dude I cant believe this
I cant believe this boy
How long has it been since youve had a car?
So its been six months
Ive been borrowin Hannahs car
to get to work in the mornin come back home
then take Zachs car to work
Or they drop me off I gotta ride back with Uncle John
Its been a pain in the butt
You picked out your car yet?
Uh uh
You should probably do that
Oh yeah In about 20 minutes were gonna go buy a car
Cool  You kinda gotta pick one
I havent given you a hug yet so
Dude its just crazy
I swear man I dont even know
No I did not expect none of this
Dude I thought I was gettin kicked outta my house
when I pulled up and saw the UHaul
Chris finally got rid of me man
Its good content so we all win
I definitely won
I drank one of your drinks Here you go
Oh yeah Actually
Root beer?
Yeah your root beer
I also ate some of your MMs
You can have your dollar back
Oh thank you
Get me another quarter though
You wanna help us?
Heck no I got a bad back man
Im tryin to recoup
Hes rich
Rich people dont have to pick up their money
Boom  You know what youre right
Im glad this worked out really good
This worked out really good Trust me
For you  Yes it did
Hey whens my pennies
in the backyard video though?
Stay tuned  Stay tuned
Its comin up
So Ill give you guys a little behind the scenes peek
of one of our videos
This is usually the amount of people it takes
to do these videos
15 if you include me 16 of you include Chandlers dad
Just movin pennies
Some of our videos literally require an entire army
We can do it on our own
but if we wanna upload two to three videos a week
theres just no way
Cause this would literally take us about two weeks
if we did it ourselves
So we just finished picking up all the pennies
and we put em in all of these boxes
As youll see these boxes are full of pennies
Were gonna take all these boxes to the dealership
and hopefully they give us a car
We just got done surprising Chandlers dad with the pennies
And now were gonna go to the dealership
and buy him and Chandler whatever they want
So lets talk strategy
You guys could buy two 10000 cars
you could buy one 20000 car
you could put 20000 down on a car 10000 on two cars
or you could just spend it all on groceries
Whats the game plan?
Im gonna spend 10000 on a down payment
Okay so youre gonna put 10 grand on down payment
So what are you gonna do with the other 10 grand?
Im gonna try to get a car for 10 grand
Alright Thats the game plan
He wants to put 10 grand down on a car
He wants to buy a car for 10 grand
Lets go see if we can make it happen
Hopefully they take the pennies
So when I got home from work today
and even after I saw all those pennies in the yard
Yeah?  Im like
yeah it was a mess in my yard
Im like oh we actually get to keep these pennies?
Well when I told Chandler I was gonna prank you
Chandler was like Okay

Hes like Oh wait what?
