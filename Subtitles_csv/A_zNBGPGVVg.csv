Hello friends!
One of the worlds most courageous military commanders
widely recognized as the most powerful king in Europe
was Napoleon Bonaparte
However he remains one of historys most controversial figures
with some praising his capabilities
while others criticize his hunger for power
Questions about the immense loss of life attributed to him persist
What is the truth?
Was he a hero of the masses or the vilest of villains?
Director Ridley Scott is set to release  a film titled Napoleon on November 24th
Scott known for directing acclaimed films  such as Gladiator The Martian and Prometheus
the trailer of the film promises an intriguing portrayal
featuring Joaquin Phoenix as Napoleon
Phoenix notably played the role of  Joker in the film of the same name
So I thought this is the perfect time
to get to know Napoleon Bonapartes story
Napoleon was born on 15th August 1769
on the island of Corsica
Look at the map it is an island  situated between France and Italy
Noteworthy for being the backdrop of the song Matargasti
from the film Tamasha starring  Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone
Corsica during the 1700s
was under the rule of a country that doesnt exist any longer
Republic of Genoa
This was the flag of the Republic of Genoa
Several territories that are now part of Italy and Greece
were under the control of this country
One such territory was Corsica
but the Corsicians were fed up with Genoan rule
They were fueled by a burgeoning sense of nationalism
and a desire to live in a free country
Pasquale Paoli emerged as a leader in  the Corsican struggle for independence
and a young Napoleon embraced Corsican nationalism
inspired by his childhood idol Paoli
By the 1760s Corsica found itself embroiled in war
while the Republic of Genoa
burdened by debt and war
decided to literally sell the island of Corsica to France in 1768
This decision caused unrest among Corsican freedom fighters
but there wasnt much that they could do
Resisting the might of Frances imperial power proved challenging
The turning point came in 1769 when  the French army clashed with Corsican forces
During the Battle of Ponte Novu
Following a swift victory France
claimed Corsica as its territory
Shortly thereafter Napoleon Bonaparte was born
His father Carlo
was a lawyer who initially fought  alongside Corsican freedom fighters
But after the French armys triumph
Paoli had to flee the country
And Carlo switched allegiance
The shift was notable as Carlo became an  ardent supporter of the French royalty
He used connections to make advances in his career
He secured the status of Nobility
By 1777 he became Corsicas representative
to the court of the new French king Louis XVI
This transformation bothered Napoleon
He harboured no fondness for his father
He viewed his father as a coward and deserter
But it was his fathers connections that
Napoleon and his brother Joseph secured scholarships
enabling Napoleon to enrol in the French Military College
At the college Napoleon was surrounded  by the children of French aristocrats
he faced ridicule at school
due to his distinctive accent
Unfazed he refrained from socialising with his peers
viewing the French as colonizers
His dream was to witness his country Corsica achieve independence
Napoleons isolation drove him to find solace in books
particularly drawn to Enlightenmentage philosopher JeanJacques Rousseau
the primary reason for that was  Rousseau wrote about Corsican freedom
and considered the Corsicians brave in his writings
In addition to philosophy
Napoleon exhibited a keen interest in mathematics history and geography
excelling in these subjects
Among his favourite reads was Plutarchs Parallel Lives
a compilation of 45 biographies featuring historical figures
like Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar
Napoleon found inspiration in Caesar  often drawing comparisons
Upon completing his schooling
Napoleon joined a military academy in Paris
specializing in artillery
Graduating as the second lieutenant  of the Royal Artillery in the French army
during all of this he would often return to Corsica
continuing to idolize Pasquale Paoli
However the landscape changed in 1789
with the onset of the French Revolution
I have made a separate video on the French Revolution
in case you havent watched it you can watch it after this
During this period Corsica fell under the  jurisdiction of the new French National Assembly
leading to the pardon of Pasquale Paoli
After a 20year exile Paoli returned
and was greeted warmly by the people of Corsica
including Napoleon
Subsequent elections in Corsica  saw Pasquale Paoli emerge victorious
becoming the President
Despite Napoleons traitorous father having passed away by the time
and Napoleon holding Paoli in high regard
Paoli harboured resentment toward Napoleons family
Consequently Paoli declared that such  traitorous families could not live in Corsica
prompting Napoleon and his family
to relocate from Corsica to France
in June 1793
Following this Paoli severed ties with  the French Revolutionary Assembly
aligning himself with their enemy the British
This is why in 1794
the AngloCorsican Kingdom was established
expelling France from Corsica
and rendering it a puppet state under British control
However this arrangement lasted only two years
In 1796 France launched an attack
reclaiming Corsica from British rule
Meanwhile France was embroiled in a civil war
marked by various factions of
French revolutionaries and counterrevolutionaries
People divided into various groups were fighting among themselves
In 1793 a political group named Jacobins
came to power and formed the French government
The group was led by Maximillien Robespierre
During this tumultuous period
Napoleon expressed his support for the  Jacobin government in a political pamphlet
This caught the attention of Robespierres brother
it greatly impressed him
This gave a boost to Napoleons career prospects
In September 1793 an event occurred that
further elevated Napoleons popularity
Toulon a French naval base
witnessed an uprising by a group
and subsequent attacks by the British forces
The French Army dispatched Napoleon  to take command at this location
Napoleon was then serving as  Senior Gunner and Artillery Commander
Napoleon proposed a strategic plan to win  this conflict
and shared it with his commanders
The plan included capturing a fort
securing a hill for artillery dominance
and launching attacks on British ships
His plan was executed
with Napoleon fighting with remarkable bravery
and suffering significant injuries
but after three months of struggle the French army emerged victorious
The General of the French Army Dugomere  speaking about Napoleon stated
I have no words to describe Bonapartes merit
much technical skill an equal degree  of intelligence and too much gallantry
Napoleon is an amazing man
In recognition of his contributions Napoleon  was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General
at the young age of 24
During this period France remained  embroiled in a civil war
and Maximilian Robespierre sought to implement reforms
Such as universal male suffrage
granting voting rights to all men above 18
While women were not granted political rights
significant reforms were instituted for them
including the right to divorce
an option that was previously unavailable to women
Additionally women gained access to  the right to education and work opportunities
Robespierres influence extended to the abolition of slavery in France
and the French colonies
leaving a lasting impact reflected in
numerous roads and metro stations  named after him in France
However Robespierres tenure was marked by controversy
particularly because of the Reign of Terror
In an effort to quash opposition to the French Revolution
thousands were executed on suspicion alone
leading to the d3ath of at least 20000 French citizens
Simultaneously the government initiated the  dismantling of Catholic Christianity in France
confiscating church properties
and promoting a singular Supreme God
to be revered through acts of service to the people
Amid these challenges and instability
a coup unfolded in July 1794 against the Jacobins government
resulting in its complete overthrow
and Robespierres execution
In August 1794 since Napoleon  supported the toppled government
he was imprisoned
He vigorously defended himself
securing his release from jail after only a few weeks
The orchestrator of this coup was  the wellknown figure Paul Barras
who had known Napoleon since the Siege of Toulon
and gradually developed a favourable opinion of him
In October 1795 Napoleon was entrusted with the task of
quelling a revolution
despite the French army facing  a numerical disadvantage of 1 to 6
Employing 40 cannons and limited infantry
Napoleon successfully suppressed the uprising within 2 hours
This pleased Paul Barras who then gave him the title of General
Napoleon became a national hero
At just 27 years old
he assumed the role of General in the French Army
Shortly thereafter he took command
of the Army of Italy
not the Italian Army
Rather the French forces operating in Italy
They were known as the Army of Italy
The troops lacked motivation discipline and supplies
Napoleon addressed this by delivering compelling speeches
emphasizing the importance of discipline for victory
and condemning looting and pillaging in conquered territories
asserting that only cowards engage in such actions
Napoleons armies didnt loot or pillage territories
Despite this Napoleon did indulge in  one form of appropriationart
Thats right
His passion for art stemmed from his  desire to establish a universal museum in Paris
showcasing a vast collection of  artworks from around the world
In later years he even renamed  the Louvre Museum
naming the museum after himself
Getting back to the Army of Italy
Napoleon led them in a famous battle against the Austrians
the Battle of Arcole
This famous painting depicts this battle
Napoleons tactics involved
rapid troop movement varied formations
and surprise attacks on the enemy
Using these Napoleons troops won the Battle of Arcole
In 1798 as France contemplated  invading the British Isles
Napoleon upon his return to Paris
refused to fight in this battle
He argued that the British Navy was formidable
and it made any invasion impractical
He proposed an alternative campaign
in the Mediterranean
Advancing southward to capture Egypt
and blocking the route of the British to India
Afterwards Napoleon planned to  assist Tipu Sultan of Mysore
in his struggle against the British
Commencing his Mediterranean campaign with 40000 soldiers
Napoleon and his soldiers set sail for  Toulon boarding numerous ships
In addition to the soldiers
he brought along over 160  scientists scholars and artists
aiming to document valuable knowledge acquired in new territories
The army progressed southward
capturing the island of Malta
before landing on the Egyptian coast in Alexandria
Battles such as the Battle of Alexandria  and the Battle of the Pyramids unfolded
Following the footsteps of Alexander the Great
and Ceaser
and destined for greatness
Resulting in victories against the Ottoman army and local kings
The French flag flew over the Citadel of Qaitbay
Look at these photos from presentday Egypt
Napoleon established the Institute of Egypt
to systematically study the countrys  history culture and resources
concurrently promoting Enlightenment ideals in Egypt
However the success of Napoleons plan was shortlived
Within a few weeks in August 1798
a formidable fleet of the British Navy attacked the French
leading to the destruction of numerous French ships
and the d3ath of a French admiral
in the Battle of the Nile
depicted in this historic painting showing numerous destroyed French ships
A year later in August 1799
following continued defeats
Napoleon clandestinely abandoned  his army and fled from Egypt
Although Napoleons military campaign was a substantial failure
Let alone reaching India and helping Tipu Sultan
Napoleon lost his hold on Egypt too
And Malta which was captured first
was recaptured by the British
Youd be wondering why Im mentioning this failure
For two reasons
Firstly despite its military setbacks the campaign
was scientifically successful
Notably the discovery of the Rosetta Stone
a slab inscribed with the same message in three different languages
the key to our understanding of the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics
The Rosetta Stone had been previously discussed  in the video on the Indus Valley Civilization
For further insights into this remarkable  artifact you may refer to that video
Additionally French scientists made significant discoveries
about the types of trees and plants indigenous to Egypt
They explored the topography of Egypt
studied architectural designs
and documented the utilization  of Egyptian jars for food preservation
The second reason why this seemingly  unsuccessful campaign holds importance
lies in Napoleons reception upon returning to France
he was welcomed as a hero
You must be perplexed by how
Napoleon who lost the territories  and abandoned his army
is welcomed as a hero?
This was due to the extensive proNapoleon  propaganda that had been ongoing for years
A multitude of mediums ranging from newspapers to paintings
official bulletins songs and poems
Napoleon was being praised throughout France
There were 6 newspapers in France back then
some of them were established by Napoleon himself
while Napoleon tookover the control over the others
These newspapers printed about various battles
The narrative in the newspapers would be set by Napoleon himself
Napoleon presented himself as a knowledgeable person
Several positive paintings and sketches were used
to depict his heroic battles
When he chose the scientists for his Mediterranean campaign
the newspapers printed seven pages  writing about each minute of the meeting
Napoleons speeches to his soldiers were widely published
along with his childhood stories  both factual and fictional
Imaginary stories of Napoleons childhood were created
of the great deeds he never did
An intriguing narrative emerged around  Napoleons love for Josephine
this romantic relationship has been  portrayed in depth in this film
Director Ridley Scott claims that Napoleons conquered the world
to win over Josephines love
But when he couldnt
he conquered the world to destroy her
Destroying himself in the process
I wont talk about this films plot too much in this video
you can watch the movie to know more
Returning to the discussion of propaganda
lets examine these propaganda paintings
One notable piece commissioned by Napoleon himself
depicts his Mediterranean campaign
portraying him helping the sick in Jaffa
and drawing parallels to Jesus Christ
Another example is this painting
illustrating the Battle of Marengo
fought between the French and Austrian armies in 1800
where Napoleon is depicted crossing the Alps on horseback
youd note that this painting is inspired by Alexanders sculpture
But why is this a propaganda painting?
Because this isnt how Napoleon crossed the Alps
Look at this painting from 1850
this is how he crossed the Alps
On a mule guided by a farmer
These propaganda paintings served a specific purpose
to show Napoleon as the hero crossing the Alps on a horse
The aim of the propaganda was to
advance Napoleons ultimate goal
his final ambition
To be on the throne
When Napoleon returned to France from Egypt
there was widespread conflict and corruption reports in France
Napoleon orchestrated a coup in November 1799
This led to the expulsion of the existing government
and the establishment of a new Consulate government
with Napoleon as the First Consul of the new government
Two individuals were appointed as aiding consuls
and a new constitution was introduced in France
Most French citizens didnt disapprove of it
due to the widespread influence of propaganda
portraying Napoleon as a figure transcending politics
acting solely in the French national interest
and championing Enlightenment ideas
To solidify public approval on the new Constitution
a referendum was held in France
and the results announced by Napoleons brother  Lucien the Minister of Interiors in France
that 999 of the 3013000 voters
supported the new constitution
It shows that 999 of the French citizens favoured Napoleon
Was that true? Absolutely not
In reality approximately 15 million votes  were cast in favour of Napoleon
French historian Claude Langlois presented evidence in 1972
revealing that the 1800 referendum was a complete fraud
with slightly over 50 of the votes cast were in favour of Napoleon
Two years later another referendum took place in 1802
where Napoleon posed the question to the public
Should he be appointed Consul for Life?
Once again the public voted
with 997 voters
supporting Napoleon to hold power for life
Even after two fraud referendums Napoleon sought further validation
In 1804 a third referendum was conducted
asking if Napoleon should become the King of France
And the result of the referendum was that
999 of the voters
voted in favour of Napoleon becoming the king
Napoleon wasnt greedy for the power
but became the King to appease the masses
Im kidding thats not how it went
Napoleon wasnt one to hide his greed for power
He openly embraced his love for power
famously declaring Power is my mistress
I have worked too hard at her conquest
to allow anyone to take her away from me
Back then this hunger for power
was a characteristic accepted among  kings and nobles of the time
Over the next decade driven by Napoleons love for power
he engaged in a series of battles across Europe
interspersed with peace treaties
such as the one signed with Britain in 1802
However the resumption of wars was inevitable
as both Napoleon and the British thirsted for power
Many European nations engaged in wars with Napoleon
not only for power but also for their survival
Many European kings and monarchs felt  threatened by the French revolutionary ideology
They considered Napolean a threat to their kingdom
In the French Revolution video I explained that
the ideology of Nationalism was introduced by the Enlightenment thinkers
Such as Rousseau and Voltaire
These were the ideologies of leftwing revolutionaries
While the rightwing adhered to  supporting monarchies and social hierarchy
preserving the existing system
The leftwing ideology championed equality
freedom and the aspiration for national freedom
evolving into the foundation of Republicanism
This nationalist fervour
was quickly spreading across other  European nations during that period
leading to the emergence of revolutionaries
challenging the reigning monarchies
In response these monarchs formed coalitions
sparking a series of coalition wars  between 1792 and 1815
where monarchies collectively waged war against France
In this context Napoleons role can be seen as
that of a liberator
propagating the slogans of freedom  and revolution throughout Europe
When Napoleons forces entered Italy he declared
to the Italian people that the French army
had come to break their chains
He told them that he bore no ill will against the masses
rather they were there to liberate them  from kings and emperors
who had oppressed them
This is why in Milan Italy  Napoleon was viewed as a hero
For liberating them from Austrian rule under King Francis II
Italian revolutionary and poet Yugo Foscolo
in 1802 said this about him
I will name you therefore Bonaparte
with the unheardof title of Liberator  of Peoples and Founder of Republics
Additionally in 1803 on of the  most renowned music composer
Beethoven paid tribute to Napoleon by  naming his Symphony No 3 after him
He named the Symphony No 3
Beethoven considered Napoleon a hero
for promoting democratic ideology  and opposing monarchy in Europe
However how could he be a hero when
he crowned himself the king
and conducted fraudulent referendums?
When Beethoven learned of Napoleon declaring himself a king
he angrily proclaimed that
Napoleon was just a man not a deity
susceptible to the lure of power  and capable of oppressing people
Beethoven subsequently removed  Napoleons name from his symphony
Indeed Napoleons decisions deviated from  the principles of the French Revolution
In 1802 he enacted two laws that
reinstated practices of slavery
Furthermore his views on women were regressive
emphasizing the importance of women  based on the number of children she bore
Napoleon revoked many rights granted to women
during the French Revolution
reinstating priority given to men in divorce laws
Although the French Revolution had  championed freedom of expression
Napoleon gradually imposed restrictions on it
Dissenters who spoke against him were exiled
and free newspapers were systematically shut down
Despite bringing stability to France
Napoleons rule maintained a dictatorial character
If he genuinely aimed to propagate  the ideas of the French Revolution
he could have reinstated democracy in France
I began this video by talking about Corsica
How Corsican independence was Napoleons childhood dream
Yet as a king he never pursued the liberation of Corsica
Instead of bringing democracy to France
Napoleon appointed his brothers as  kings in the conquered territories
In May 1808
France initiated a war against Spain
resulting in the Spanish King Carlos IV stepping down
and Napoleon installing his brother Joseph as the new ruler
Before this Joseph had been  the king of Naples and Sicily
Napoleons younger brother Jerome  was crowned the king of Westphalia
a region in presentday Germany
Additionally when the Kingdom of Holland  fell under Napoleons control in 1806
Louis another of Napoleons brothers  was made the king of that region
However amidst this hunger for power
there is a positive legacy  left by Napoleon worth noting
Several decisions he made had farreaching  benefits for the future of France and Europe
The Napoleonic Code of 1804
stands out as a landmark legal framework providing France
with a comprehensive and written set of laws
The second achievement was the establishment  of equality for males under the law
despite the setbacks for womens rights
and the reintroduction of slavery
The equal rights given to the male citizens by the law
remained unchanged
Furthermore Napoleons era marked  the end of feudalism in France
In the territories he occupied
the same laws were enforced
Third Secularism
During Napoleons rule the French  government adopted a secular stance
There was religious freedom in France
allowing individuals to practice their chosen religions
In 1801 Christianity did return to France
when Napoleon signed an agreement with the Pope
But the relationship between the Church and the Government
never fully went back to the way it used to be
The power balance shifted more favourably towards the government
While traditional positions of the  Catholic clergy in the Church were restored
the government retained control over the selection of bishops
and supervised the churchs finances
significantly diminishing the influence  of the church in European affairs
Fourth establishing a banking system
The Bank of France was founded by Napoleon in 1800
It brought hyperinflation under control
and stabilized the currency
Fifth he introduced a modern and efficient tax system
ending the exemptions previously granted to nobility and kings
ensuring that everyone contributed to the tax base
Sixth in the education system
Napoleon set up primary secondary and high schools
along with establishing the University of France
Uniformity was introduced to the education system
teachers were trained
and a centralized recruitment process for teachers was initiated
The government also regulated technical schools  civil service schools and military schools
leading to a rapid improvement  in the overall quality of education
Seventh water distribution
In 1808 Napoleon modernized Pariss water  distribution system by upgrading old pumps
constructing a new canal
to direct water to the city
and building 15 water fountains
He ensured that Parisians would never starve
Storehouses and granaries were modernized
and eight new markets were constructed
wine market wheat market
everything happened in an organised manner
In conclusion despite Napoleons hunger for power
he wasnt a clueless ruler
Napoleon emerged as a highly intelligent and effective administrator
implementing several positive reforms for the French people
Some people draw comparisons  between Napoleon and Hitler
which in my opinion are entirely inaccurate
as Napoleon did not propagate hatred  against any religion or community
nor did he employ strategies of divide and rule
While Napoleons actions resulted in the d3aths of millions
but he was driven by his thirst for war and power
Finally lets talk about how Napoleon d!ed
Despite his numerous victories  he also faced defeats
Such as Napoleons Egyptian campaign as discussed earlier
Napoleon had installed a Continental System
a comprehensive economic blockade against Britain
by all French allied countries
When Russia violated this continental system in 1812
Napoleon launched an attack on Russia
The Russian forces refused to fight
They would retreat and set fire to the battlefield
leaving nothing for Napoleons troops as provisions
Even so Napoleons army reached Moscow
but the city was empty
and after a month of waiting for the Russians to surrender
to no avail
Napoleons hungry army had to retreat from the barren city
The next year in 1813
a coalition comprising the United Kingdom  Russia Prussia Austria Sweden
and other countries collectively attacked Napoleon
in the Battle of Leipzig
dealing a significant blow to France
This led to Napoleons exile  to the island of Elba in 1814
However in 1815 he made a dramatic comeback
rallying his soldiers and marching towards Paris
Despite briefly reclaiming the throne with public support
his rule lasted only three months
The United Kingdom and its allies
waged another war against Napoleon
culminating in the Battle of Waterloo  the final battle of Napoleon
Following this defeat Napoleon was  exiled to the remote island of St Helena
where he passed away six years later
in 1821
marking the end of Napoleons remarkable story
