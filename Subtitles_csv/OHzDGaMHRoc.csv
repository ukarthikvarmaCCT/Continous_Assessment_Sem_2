I can feel the sunlight
Touching on my skin
Boy I feel you eyes Pierce me deep within
I feel your eyes
They bring desire ohhh ohhh
Everytime you are next to me
You look like trouble
Dangerous lover
Get on the dance floor
Show me what you came for
Babe when you touching me Im loosing my control
Dont leave me here
Dancing on my own
You feel like summer
