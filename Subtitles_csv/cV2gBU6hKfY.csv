This is one of the dirtiest beaches in the entire world
And were gonna pick up every single piece of trash
on this beach
Starting with this water bottle
One out of millions of pieces of trash
We did it!
This will take forever
upbeat island music
Bottle me up baby
Im hungry for your plastic
As you can see this is taking forever
Oscar come on in
This is Oscar professional beach cleaner
Is this basically how you guys clean beaches?
Mainly we do the big stuff first
and then we bring a lot of people with sifters as well
for the small stuff
You scoop it into this thing
and then shake out the sand
and you got a bunch of trash
This right here is the first bag of trash
Hundreds more to go How do we do this quicker?
We just need more people
That seems simple Can you clap for me?
Oscar clapping
There you go! All the volunteers
crowd cheering
Okay guys were gonna clean this up using the vice
Were gonna clean this up Groups of four!
Groups of four in this area
Part of me wanted to see if me and the boys
could clean up this beach by ourselves
and the other part of me realizes
that wouldve taken a year
I couldve told you that
Jimmy Yeah?
The oceans putting more trash on the beach
Theres so much underwear in the ocean
Im enacting a new law
Thou shall not throw your underwear in the ocean
Wait did you guys already fill up a bag?
You guys are better than us
They are professionals to be fair
upbeat music
After 12 hours of cleanup
this is what we managed to achieve which isnt enough
Boys bring it in
Tomorrow Im gonna bring in 10 times the volunteers
record scratching
flipflop squeaks
Its now the next day
crowd cheers
upbeat music

But as slowly as possible
Whos more bueno? Mark Rober or MrBeast?

Make sure you watch until the end of the video
to find out how were gonna pick up
30 million pounds of trash
Thank you for coming to our country
and help us with this initiative
That is really awesome
upbeat music
Right here Right there
Stop Hes not stopping
Im gonna move
In this bad boy is 6000 pounds of trash
And now we have 36000 pounds of trash
which weighs the same as 3000 cats or three Trexes
Whichever you prefer
While I was talking with some of the locals
they mentioned that theres a beach down the street
that was also very dirty
So I said Nolan with a bunch of volunteers
to go clean that beach as well
Theres a whole car bumper right here
Theres a car bumper here? Did this come outta the ocean?
People litter weird things
What type of trash have you seen along the beach?
Most importantly most commonly is plastics
And we see that in every form on the beach here
They ended up removing 12000 pounds of trash
which brought us up to a total
of 50000 pounds of trash from just two beaches
Check out this power move Watch this
Look at that!
Is that how you want us to dump it?
Yeah dude Im taking one for the team
Im a team player
Oh yeah I dont even have to look
There you go Mark
It actually kind of works
And if you guys look over there
were actually getting close to the end of the beach
This is what the beach looked
like at the start of the video
And this is what it looks like with like 20 left
Were getting there
Were doing it!
Unfortunately between the ocean washing up trash
to the beach and rivers bringing in new trash from
the mainland obviously this beach is gonna get dirty again
But with your guys help we can stop a much bigger issue
Were almost done Jimmy
I know! Four straight days of picking up trash
And just like that we removed over 60000 pounds of trash
from the worlds dirtiest beach
And even though this 60000 pounds of trash we picked up
might seem impressive
there is sadly way too much trash still in the ocean
Two years ago we crushed our goals with Team Trees
and planted 20 million trees
And now its time to do it again
Which is why we along with hundreds of other creators
are launching Team Seas
And for every 1 you guys donate like this
one less pound of trash will be in the ocean
But what if I wanted to donate 10 Jimmy?
I conveniently have 10 pounds of trash right here
that is now out of the ocean
Boom Gone
You get the point
One dollar donated as one less pound of trash in the ocean
And Id like to personally thank YouTube Originals
for supporting Team Seas and helping us fund it
Theyre gonna be matching the first 400000
worth of donations dollar for dollar
And we wanna remove 30 million pounds
of trash from the ocean
Which is just so freaking audacious
This only happens if we all work together
Half the money we raise is going towards
funding volunteer beach cleanups like we did here today
all across the world as well as literally
fishing trash out of the ocean
And the other half will be used for these
trasheating robots that pick up trash 24 hours a day
365 days a year from rivers that flow to the ocean
Go to teamseasorg or click the donate button
