Friends all of you often talk about
your laptops computers  mobile phones about the type of processor display  battery
how much storage and RAM it has
and think that increasing RAM and storage will make it great
But here comes the question that we are going to discuss today in this video
that whether increasing the size of RAM has any real practical benefit or should we also take a look at the speed of the RAM
Hello friends my name is Gaurav You are watching Technical Guruji Lets begin
Friends RAM is something which we are able to discuss very easily with our friends
because it is easy to understand like 1GB 2GB  5GB
but if it is a complex term which a common man cant understand then maybe people wont talk about it so much
For example people dont generally talk about the Cache memory because
a common person doesnt know the role of a Cache memory
Now whether it is 2MB Cache or 4MB Cache he doesnt really care
Yes But people understand RAM 1GB 2GB 3GB the more the better
and on the basis of this thinking we keep deciding about the devices
I remember my first android phone  which was Samsung Galaxy S2 it only had 1 GB RAM
There were many phones available in the market below this as well at the time
And now we have 23456 and now we even hear the rumors that upcoming phone will be 8GB RAM 16GB RAM
And all we are focusing on is to increase this number further But have you ever thought
whether we practically need this much RAM or not?
Suppose today if you want to build a PC at home to play games 8 GB RAM is all you need All the games work smoothly on that
But as we are always looking for the best so despite it costing more
we will go for 32 GB RAM 64 GB RAM
does the RAM whether 8GB or 32 GB play any role in the performance of the game?
Not really
So guys there is a thing called RAM capacity
Suppose I am the processor and the table is the RAM and whatever I am working on I have already called it here
Everything else is stored in the cupboard which is actually the Hard Drive
Now suppose if this table was very large still my hands can reach this space only
so only this RAM is of my use
Or if suppose the jobs at my hand are small enough to fit this space then I dont really need a table that big
So after a limit the remaining RAM is a waste and you are not really able to use that resource
but if suppose this table starts throwing object that I need in the job towards me so that I am able to work with more speed
that is in simple language the RAM has become fast
the data transfer between the RAM and Processor is taking place faster
so this will be beneficial to you instead of just increasing the size of the table again and again
4681525  people keep on increasing RAM and then think that their device is faster
So here we need to think a bit practically I understand that the table RAM is sufficient for you today
but it might not be enough in 2 years time with improvement in the softwares
I understand that after sometime you need to upgrade your phone or PC whatever it is  but we need to see where we are getting the best value currently
You need to see the specifications of the RAM How many Mega Hertz is its speed whether DDR3 stick is used or DDR4 stick is used
Whether your phone has DDR3 RAM or DDR4 RAM or what does your processor supports best where you will get the best optimization
We sometimes ignore these things and just keep running behind MORE
Bro! I am using 64 GB RAM
For what purpose? Games
You could have played the same game on 8GB RAM as well
These are few things that we need to keep in mind
You can tell me in the comment section below about your views on this blind race
I mean we dont even know the finish point of this race We dont even know why are we in this race But we are just running behind the numbers
The same thing goes with the storage
People say  I have a hard drive of 2TB
Now if same person is told that I have a Solid State Drive SSD of 256 GB
capacity is less than Hard Drive but performance is many times better then he might not be able to understand it
so here we need to have these things in mind that not only we choose the best possible technology for ourselves but also understand why are we choosing it
Friends you can tell me about any such experiences you have had faced with any friend or with some relative
where they were fighting over the numbers
