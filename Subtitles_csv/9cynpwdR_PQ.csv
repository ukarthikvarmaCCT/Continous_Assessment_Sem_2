Friends this is the
First Class in Emirates
Friends our tickets have been upgraded to the First Class
The lounges are up ahead
and theres even a gym here
A gym in the airport!
This one?
I thought it was that one
Fast Lane
Is this your fast lane pass?
Fast Lane pass ready!
Our gate is at C
they told us itd take half an hour to reach there by walking
This airport is so huge that
you can walk for half an hour in it
all within the same building
This is the poster of Spirit of Dubai
But this woman in the painting
seems to be carrying the Indian flag
Quite an international painting
People of all kinds
And even some Mongolian army
And were at their First Class Lounge
And the Business Class Lounge is on the other side
So actually we were rejected from the First Class Lounge
because they said that the upgrades
do not include access to the Lounge
Even though our seats got upgraded
the upgrade doesnt allow us to go to the Lounge
So were not fully in First Class
Were actually half a class
Such an insult
Theres a golden palm tree at the airport
Look at those gold bars
No youre doing it to the Business Class
you need to do it to the
This is a Boeing 777 plane
Airbus A380 is better than this
Because that has 2 floors
This is the same
Id say that this is the second best
Whats our seat?
Wow theres so much space!
I dont see any place to store the bags above us
Theyve even provided us slippers
It literally feels like a room you know?
Like you booked a hotel room or something
Theyve kept flowers there
Oh yeah?
Once you close this and that one
well kind of have our own little cave
There are so many mirrors here
The one that you can see here is the TV
The real mirror is here
in case you need to put on makeup
Theres a mirror at the side behind the lamp
Theres a mirror at the bar
so that you can check out the drinks stored here
Theres a mirror at the back too
The seat is less of a seat
and more of a mirror maze
And weve taken off
Most of the seats in the First Class are empty
If I zoom in a lot
I can see the Burj Khalifa
See there it is
Let me reduce the brightness a bit
They have an accurate map here
Look at how fast the plane is flying
The seat belt sign has been turned off
let me take out the tripod
so that I can show you everything properly
By pushing this button
this door closes
Now that the doors have closed
this has turned into a room of sorts
No one can peek in from the outside
because the doors are quite tall
And theres a barrier between me and Juli as well
This one
By raising this one this will become a proper room
See you
Do you see how high these are?
From both sides
The only thing missing is a roof on top
But theres no roof
Its just empty space above us
Above this height
and above this height here
So if I stand up
I can easily peek in
Even so as I told you theres a lot of privacy
Let me open this one
Because theres some nice light here
Pull Here To Open
Since this isnt allowing me to pull
well have to push the button
And now lets take a look at the menu
The menu here is so good
Therere so many dishes for you
And such posh dishes
Like see this one
Honey Roasted Pumpkin with Thyme
Pan Fried King Oyster Mushroom
I will order this dish
And dont be misled with the word Oyster
this is a vegan dish
Oyster Mushroom is a type of mushroom
Not oyster
Awardwinning triple cream blue cheese from Germany
Well that is fancy
Premium aged Dutch gouda
Handmade red
How do you pronounce that?
Juli has already made her bed here
Actually theyve even provided mattresses here
So you can take out the mattress
before you lie down
and there are pillows obviously
And a blanket as well
You can see how spacious this is when you look from above
Look how much space I have to spread out
My feet are still not reaching the end
Theres so much extra space in here
So do you wanna work on something?
Or write down any ideas?
Just press that thing there
What thing?
This board
This? Yeah
This one? Yeah
They gave you a whole notebook
With an Emirates plane
Im gonna work Work on the next video ideas?
Weve closed both doors here
Juli is going to sleep
and no one will come to disturb us
so I think this is the best time
do the most exciting thing
Whats the most exciting thing?
The various buttons that we have here
and the different secret compartments
lets explore those
First of all here
This opens and closes the door
With this the table tray comes out
And this makes the bed
So lets turn this seat into a bed
Look at the width of this bed
I have big hands
I span 15 cm approximately
so I think the bed is 45cm50cm wide
The blanket is here
theres the mattress
Juli has already laid down her mattress
Apart from this theres a small iPad here
this controls the TV screen
And theres a compartment here
You can store your phone here
Right above it are these buttons
that moves this barrier
What is this thing?
This looks like a fan of sorts
I dont know which button turns this on
And with the buttons here
these lights can be turned on and off
This button controls the brightness of the lights
You can control the brightness as well
There are so many settings here
What happened? What did this open?
Oh I got it this basically
is pressed to bring out this iPad
and this button locks it
There are two more buttons
Lets press them and see what happens
Oh wow its ascending in style
This drinks area moves up a bit by pressing this
And pressing it again send it back
Whats this thing?
So big
This is so huge
That was some quality sleep here
Since this bed is so spacious
Sleeping normally on your back
though it is possible in business class
but you cant move from one side to the other
You have to sleep straight on your back
But theres so much space here
you can sleep on your sides
and even fold your legs and sleep
You can do it all
It is so spacious
And the mattress that theyve provided
this is so comfortable
Foods about to come
Lets see how the food will be
Im watching the movie
Bunty and Babli 2
I havent watched it before
Even the screens so big
This is their Mango Avacado Salad
And this is the first course
Friends the main course has arrived
This main dish looks like a meat dish
but these are oyster mushrooms
A seasonal salad with it
and the pumpkin side dish
And a delicious feast is ready here
Friends can you see this?
This is unbelievably good
After experiencing luxury at this level
the only point of concern is that
whenever we travel next
how will any experience match up to this?
Well be disappointed
So after I made the video on cold drinks
you might wonder what I drink since I dont drink cold drinks
other than drinking water
Ive ordered a virgin mojito here
A virgin mojito contains water and lime juice
and sugar
If you reduce the amount of sugar in it
to relatively theres nothing harmful in it
Like this one has little to no sugar
Very little sugar
If you want to drink this
keep in mind that normally
virgin mojito contains a lot of sugar
but if you drink it with only a little sugar
Normally they make it with soft drink
Pour some soft drink then lime juice and mint
This one hardly has any if any
sugar or soft drink
so its more like sparkling water
with lime juice and mint
And its extremely refreshing
Even the bread basket was special here
When I took out a bread from here it turned out to be garlic bread
See the garlic stuffing in it
Another big difference
are the headphones you get
Look at these they look so high quality
And everyone gets a snack basket
And it has everything
It has some nuts some trail mix
gummy bears
Chocolate of which I already ate a piece
And some vegetable chips
Lets see whats going on here
Oh they booked the VIP package
What is that?
Lets stick to work
Theres a hilarious scene in the movie
When the BuntyBabli song plays
So they say MashaAllah in the song
and the subtitles write it as Hallelujah
Wait youll see now
Its interesting to read the subtitles
To see how things have been translated
sometimes the translations are really weird
There are some things that Ive still not understood
What are they actually?
There are always some undecipherable things
Like this one over here
It seems like a speaker
But whats the purpose of having a speaker?
For announcements?
If you look at the quality of the things
in comparison to the normal seats or business class seats
theyre of high quality
Theyre a fabric layer here
this isnt just plastic
Its real gold
This is real gold?
I dont think so
That would be too much
Another interesting thing here
this is a light
thats normal
But this is the AC vent
Ive finally figured out how to turn it on
It turns on like this
and blows so much air
you can literally dry your hair
If you look at the bottom here
theres a charger here
you can close this
Another USB charger here
And a belt that you can pull out
I think the purpose of this belt is different
Because theres another belt lower than the first
And I think both belts can be attached there
and keep the bags secure
in case the bags are moving about
Talking about the corner spaces
theres a corner space here
what have they put there?
This is a small compartment
I might just be an empty space
And the magazines and headphones were placed here
These two doors thats actually one door
the blinds point down
We can look down from the inside
but someone outside at eye level wont be able to look inside
This is the first seat where you can fold your legs and sit
Whenever I watch a film
I regret it because
On this flight of 56 hours
I feel like watching a movie here is a waste of time
That Im missing out on a chance to enjoy
Each minute spent on this seat
should be fully enjoyed
not wasted by watching a movie
Thats what Im feeling repeatedly
This is another unique angle here
Im showing you the seat from all angles
so that you get the best idea
