We just got dropped off in the middle of an abandoned city
And were going to spend the next seven days here
And there goes our only way out
Were now stranded for the next seven days
Why are we doing this?
For content
This once beautiful city was bombed an abandoned
because of war
which means the only people here are us and our cameraman
At least that we know of
So I guess we start off by getting off the roof
We knew that our first objective was to explore this city
and find a safe place to call home for the next seven days
which starts with exploring this building
All right lets see whats down the bottom of this building
I assume under this wood is a floor
Only one way to find out
All right this is crazy
I feel like Im in a zombie apocalypse
This is wild
Oh look at this
After a little more exploring
we stumbled upon an area that might work for our shelter
Oh my Gosh
I think this is where we should set up camp
You can see the entire city over here
Plus we have a roof to protect us from rain
And now that we had our home base decided
the next step was to open up
the supplies crate left by the helicopter on the roof
Lets pop open this crate so we can build camp
We need some gear
This crate contains all of the survival gear
well need for the next seven days
And so we dont have to carry stuff all the way down the stairs
Were just going to drop it
We have a perfect assembly line
Kris its raining sleeping bags
Chandler theres our dinner plates
Wait Chandler dont let it fall
That was the coolest thing weve ever done
But jokes aside it was time to actually start surviving now
Who wants fire duty?
Well get it  Were on bed duty
Kris got started on making a fire with Mark
Im personally a fan of the log cabin when it comes to fires
Eagle Scout Did I mention that yet?
While Chandler and I look for something for us to sleep on
This is what mattresses were like a hundred years ago?
Wait you found a mattress?
Yeah  Where?
On the second floor in a corner
Thats all you  Thanks
You should wrap that thing in a tarp
so you dont get destroyed by bugs
Im going to wrap that mattress like a burrito
And while Chandler took us chances with a sketchy mattress
The rest of us decided to sleep on wooden doors
Theres no shot that youre more comfortable than me right now
My back already hurts
There are so many buildings we have yet to explore in the city
Tomorrows going to be insane
Well see you in the morning
Even though our first day in the city went pretty smooth
Something eerie did happen to occur later that night
While we were sleeping
Mark and some of the camera guys
woke up to the sound of breaking glass
not far from the camp
Which made us start to wonder
if we were really alone inside the city
What was it?
We just heard glass shattering there
I thought I saw something
But on top of the freaky noises
this first shelter was way too windy to sleep
Howd you guys sleep?
So in pursuit of better sleep we got up got breakfast
and prepare to find our new shelter
This is the first time Ive had chili for breakfast
But Im so hungry I kind of dont care
Well since the raft
When have I ever been this excited over canned chili?
I think my brain tried to forget about that Thanks
So after a nutritious breakfast we took off our drone
to seek out a new shelter in the unexplored buildings
We havent explored that building
We havent explored those hotels
It is an actual city here
However upon scanning the buildings
we did stumble upon an unexpected guest
Theres a cat  Theres a cat down there
Im going to land the drone right beside the cat
Look at that shot
Kris Kris look its sniffing the camera
This cat has no survival instinct
I promise we are not paying this cat to be an actor
As fun as playing with these cats is we need to focus on shelter
because its going to be freezing tonight
And so we started our journey
to find a sufficient shelter for the challenge
Wait what is this?
This is pretty
It just has this type of like aesthetic to it
that is like beautiful even though its ugly
Zombie apocalypse aesthetic
Yeah There you go
Wait is that a pool?
What the heck?
This is so eerie
Back in the day this used to look something like this
And after decades
of rotting from being abandoned this is what were left with
Wait theres a soccer field?
The sports court
Is that a soccer ball?
I almost died
I bet this soccer ball is older than me
Older than all of us for sure
Well besides Mark hes old
We have two options now
We can keep exploring down this cool looking tunnel
and go check out the neighborhood
Or with the hour of light we have left
we can prep for nighttime and not freeze all night
Not freeze  That sounds like a good idea
I agree
And after spending the entire day looking for a new shelter
I just cant get over how massive the city is
We finally found a place fortified enough to call home
So we dont freeze tonight
Were thinking of setting up camp in this room right here
Well have a fire pit right here
We can tarp the wall right there Its going to be comfy
Yeah Marks going to do all that
I said we
The only hard part is come over here
Our current camp and all our gear is all the way over there
I hope this place really works out
because its going to be a lot of effort to set up
With the sun getting low and the temperature rapidly dropping
We made our way back to the old camping spot
and packed up to settle into the new base
Were headed into the new campsite
The new camp the new camp
The new camp
Okay weve got a lot of cleanup to do to prep this for tonight
This looks like a terrible place but whatever
After finding a more weatherproof base
we spent the next few hours dragging in as many of our belongings
as we could before sundown
Now because it got dark so fast
we couldnt bring all of our resources to the new base
So aside from one water bag
cans of chili and a couple of old mattresses this is all we had
What does everyone think of our new place?
I like that theres no wind
And its much warmer
It was now the third day of seven doing this challenge
And once we got up we continued exploring
Be careful
These stairs actually steep
On this whole staircase
three of the stairs are normal
This beach is nice
It actually smells like a beach
Its because it is a beach
But not too far in something strange happened
I think I see someone
Dont you see that reflecting thing over there under the stairs?
Oh I do
Jimmy remember how we almost died
the first night from glass bottle attack?
I wonder if thats where the glass bottles came from
It was at this moment when we realized
we actually werent alone in this abandoned city after all
And once our cameraman spotted this mysterious person on our drone
we did what anyone would do
Lets go check it out
That building is sick
Why is this mansion beside this giant motel?
Decades ago this hotel stood as a first class vacation resort
But years of war turn this once picturesque property
into a city of ruins
Lets head on in
What did we just get ourselves into?
We totally dont wait for the cameraman
to walk in the room before we go in
Its getting dark
Everyone stop
We should go in there
Ill go first
Go ahead Thank you
You think its a Feastables bar?
What the heck?
This is starting to get very eerie and I think Mark should go first
Look at how deep this hallway is
Also if you fall over here you might die
Theres a very nonzero chance somebody could be in here
and like attack us
If someone attacked us What are we doing?
Every man for himself
Yeah whoevers the slowest just dies
Whats that light?
Im creeped out now guys
We spent the rest of the day searching for the lurk
but once it started getting dark
we can only hope that later he wouldnt be looking for us
And now that its dark out
heres what weve actually been waiting for
Give me Big Bertha
Thank you
Big Bertha
Notice how you cant see that building over there
This is the worlds most powerful flashlight
Now you can
Bro I bet the fish in the ocean are tripping
It stopped working
How the mighty have fallen
The pluses of our actions is we got to play with the worlds
strongest flashlight at night
The negatives of our actions is that we got to walk back in the dark
That was bad timing
Its way scarier going through this place at night
Yeah a thousand percent
It really feels like the world is ending
and were just like surviving
So to avoid being murdered in cold blood
we return back the camp
Were back at camp
Yeah Ill get a fire going
Im hungry
Theres literally only chili left
And so with the last of our supply here were feasting
Tomorrow if we got some tables and seven chairs
And more food  Thatd be awesome
But when we woke up on the morning of day four out of seven
we realized that we were already running low on supplies
Our bag of water is out of water
Do we have more?
Point the camera at that roof all the way over there
I wish I had more than a hundred calories in my body to go get it
Nose goes
What does nose goes mean?
It sounds like youre going
Hes going to need help He cant carry it on his own
So Mark and Chandler set out to go all the way back
to ground Zero to get more supplies from the crate
Chandler and I were on a side quest for water
This is a main quest
While they get the water
we dont want to be useless
We? Im fine
I dont want us to be useless
So were going to go try to find a table and some chairs
But we didnt get very far before Kris got distracted
Did we not know this was here?
Yeah?  I found a bike
That looks like a nice bike
Whered you find that?  In here
This is the coolest abandoned city ever
Having fun?  I am
All right Im going to go look for a table
Okay Lets go
How are we going to get the water out of this?
Its heavy
The thought process is that this is a house
And what do people have in their house?
Tables and chairs
Wait hold up
Look at this Dont move
Jimmy Jimmy
its a chair
Marks strong
A little help here Chan
This bag of water is over a hundred pounds
And so my buddy Mark being the science YouTuber that he is
had an idea to get it down from the roof more effectively
Our rope broke
We need stronger rope
What youre watching is real
Mark literally deleted half of our water
We got some bad news
Hurry up hurry up
The rope broke and all the water splattered on the ground
This was actually a very serious problem
Oh no
Are you kidding me?
Dont worry dude we got one bag of water left
Carry this one down please
And now that half of our water is actually gone
The only possible way to complete this seven day challenge would
unfortunately be to send two of us home
So Kris and Chandler volunteered to leave the city
leaving Mark and I with just enough resources
to make it the full seven days
Genuinely I would be scared if we left Jimmy
with anybody other than you
I think you got it  Oh you guys
But before they left
we wanted to have one final feast with the whole gang
Now thats a Feastables smores
My hair Yummy
Great melting point on the chocolate Jimmy if I may
If youve tried Feastables before the ones that used to look like this
you havent tried Feastables
Our brand new formula tastes so much better
Genuinely go to Walmart try Feastables
and tell me what you think
Its honestly way better than the old formula but dont take my word for it
I just worked at NASA so
Well I just had smores so I can go to the boat now?
And so we launched a flare to signal the boat
which was actually pretty cool
Bro look how cool that looks
Wait its lighting up the entire city
But the not cool part is now that Kris and Chandler are gone
its just Mark and I surviving in the city
I feel so lonely
Its our first day without our friends
But were going to make the best of the situation
Our objective for today is to renovate our shelter
Were going to put up tarps and windproof this room
Were going to build a fireplace in here and heat it up
Were going to find shelves and tables
Were going to make this place looks like a home
With some of the ideas we have planned I might stick around until day 14
Hes lying
And so we started exploring some nearby buildings
to find furnishing for our shelter
which is when we found this
awesome shelf this little table a massive carpet
and also this metal thing that was found by our camera guy
Look at this chair
That works still man
Bro Thats comf
I found a fake TV
We can make it look like we have a TV now
Its a good find
Wow thats just so cool
this like courtyard with the arches
Each building in this city has its own personality
What can we do with these?
We could use like a vent system like this
Combined with these we can make a fireplace
Like actual wallpaper
We have wallpaper
What do we use it for?
To make the house a home Jimmy
Its like we went grocery shopping but instead
we grabbed a bunch of 30yearold garbage
Honey were home
We found all this stuff
Now were going to start decorating
Were no longer surviving Jimmy Were thriving
I like that
We literally spent the next 4 hours
moving all the rubble out of our shelter
which made us pretty thirsty
The water in these sacks tastes like trash
which is why we all brought a Cirkul water bottle
because you can put a flavor cartridge in it
and make water taste good
This is my first time drinking a Cirkul bottle
Delightful experience
You can determine the intensity
So if youre feeling really audacious you can have level nine flavor
Or if youre just a wuss you can have a level one flavor
Im trying six
Six Ill match your six
That tastes awesome
Which flavor are you using?
Im rocking fruit punch because its got energy
And you know what we need right now Jimmy?
Thats right  Good thing Cirkul has our back
And now that we had been hydrated
it was time to start crushing these renovations
When everythings said and done
this room will be the greatest room in an abandoned city youve ever seen
This is our new shelf
All right lets see how she looks
See that? See all that dust?
Oh isnt that satisfying?
And now that the shelf is clean we can use it to store food
For some reason over half the food we packed is chili
And no one here likes chili
Thats the non chili row
Thats the chili row
This is the Feastables row right there
Now we have a table to put our Cirkul water bottles
Mark has a 22 ounce bottle This is the 32 ounce bottle
And they have a metal double insulated bottle
that you can get for free right now if you buy ten flavor cartridges
What a steal
Its not a steal Its free
All right
Thats going to block a lot of wind
With our new door in place
we also hung up this huge tarp
which will allow us to keep all the heat
from the fireplace inside our shelter
Oxygen comes in
fire burns sends heat in the room send smoke out
This is redneck engineering at its finest
Finally after being cold for so long
All right  Look at that
And we have a fire
I can feel the heat coming out
Wait Jimmy rigged this up in like ruins from an abandoned city
Anyway go to DrinkCirkulcomMrBeast
Or scan the QR code on his face if you want to order a Cirkul right now
This is the final room We have plenty in the corner
We have our beds that are now smaller
Tell me this isnt genius
This is Marks iPad in the TV frame
Obviously some nice lighting a furnace
that is heating up the room a real table with chairs
and a shelving unit with the scraps of food we have left
and a dirty towel weve been sharing
This is survival
But just as our night was going so well for the fifth day in a row
we heard a broken glass
Mark  Im right here dog
What was that?
Man we were having such a good day too
I want to go see whos upstairs
Im carrying the knife as a threat but Im not going to use it
Hey if youre up here just come out
I want to be best friends with you
Are you serious youre not pranking me?
Bro I swear to you it was not me
What is this?
Bro! Oh my God
This is the most Mark Rober thing Ive ever seen
What the heck? You swore!
Yeah so turns out Mark was pranking us
and he was the one dropping these bottles the whole time
Ive got a remote control here But no one suspects it
I can be in my sleeping bag
and I can start launching glass bottles through the roof
Freak everyone out
Oh my gosh
I thought I could trust you
Now that Marks not pranking me we rerigged his contraption
Feastables me
There you go
Ill take one
I got one as well
Thats kind of cool
To be honest it was pretty easy to forgive Mark
because we only had one day left in this challenge
Good morning
Good morning abandoned city
Abandoned city abandoned city
Its so much colder out here than it is in there
Lets go back
Its now the morning of day six
All the modifications we did were phenomenal
and it was at least ten degrees warmer
That was amazing  Slept incredible
Mark on our last real day I say we go have some fun
Yeah!  Yeah!
Jimmy is that a kayak?
I know what we should do with it
Now someone can kayak in this pool
Me and Mark really did have a lot of fun
Played baseball played soccer
Mark even taught me how to skip rocks scientifically
There it is
And even screaming at each other from different sides of the city
Mark!  What!
Lets throw things off the roof at the same time!
Great idea!
To be honest doing all these kind of dumb things
really did take our minds off of how lonely this city really was
And by the time the final day of this challenge arrived
after cleaning up camp we only had one objective in mind
Leaving this place and never coming back
Im here!
Im here!  Freedom!
Huge shout out to Mark  He didnt have to do this
He has his own channel is very busy
Heres the channel I appreciate you
And lets get out of here
Lets go
By the way Im giving away 10000 a day
for the next 20 days to people who buy Feastables
Go buy the new formula it tastes amazing
