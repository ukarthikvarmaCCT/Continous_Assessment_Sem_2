Hello friends!
The IsraelPalestine war began over a month ago
over 10000 lives have been lost already
Surprisingly amidst this tragedy  certain entities are benefiting significantly
American weapons manufacturers
Since the war began the stocks of these companies
have surged by 30 billion
The two major defense contractors in America
Raytheon and General Dynamics
have unabashedly informed investors
that the war in Israel  would be financially advantageous
Other arms manufacturers like  Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman
have experienced substantial  stock gains over the past three years
Lockheed Martin produces  F35 Lightning II fighter jets used by Israel
as well as Black Hawk helicopters
Northrop Grumman produces submarines and combat vehicles
Israel signed a 3 billion deal in July
to buy these F35 fighter jets
One might wonder about the source  of Israels substantial military budget
An obvious answer would be
that it is Israeli taxpayers fund
But look at this news article
In September 2016 during President Obamas tenure
the US and Israel signed a 38 billion deal
as per this deal the US provides military equipment  worth 38 billion to Israel annually
Consequently a staggering 92 of Israels imported weapons now
originate from one country
The United States of America
But why does this matter?
A country buying weapons from an ally  country would not seem suspicious
But the peculiarity of this situation is that
the weapons industry doesnt care about any alliances
The weapons industry has only one objective
earning maximum profit
This year in January the US State Department announced
a recordbreaking 205 billion in weapon sales
to various countries worldwide
in the latest fiscal year
Weapons worth more than 200 Billion  were sold in a year by only one country
Marking a 49 increase from the previous year
These weapons went to 58 different countries
including not only Israel but also
several Arab nations such as Lebanon Saudi Arabia
Qatar Kuwait the United Arab Emirates
Bahrain and Iraq
Does selling these weapons make the world a safer place?
Or unsafe?
The issue extends beyond the United States
last year Israel also set a record in weapon sales
surpassing 12 billion
This substantial figure includes sales of  drones missiles rockets and air defense systems
Notably 3 billion or the 12 billion that is 24 of this total export
was to Arab countries
Israel ranks as the 10th largest arms exporter globally
with the top four positions occupied by
the United States Russia France and China
The United Kingdom holds the 7th position
What distinguishes these five countries is
their status as permanent members of  the United Nations Security Council
A striking fact is that combining their weapon sales
constitutes over 75 of global arms exports
After this fact comes to light
how can one expect that
the United Nations would adopt a resolution
to curtail arms exports globally?
In May of this year Oxfam Internationals Head of New York office highlighted that
four out of the five permanent  members of the UN Security Council
are the worlds leading arms sellers
These weapons fuel conflicts worldwide
This is truly hypocritical complicit and immoral
Apart from them Germany Italy and South Korea
also feature among the top 10 arms exporters
The weapons industry isnt bothered by
whats right and whats wrong who is an ally and who is not
This is evident in several examples
While many consider Russia a close friend to India
it is also one of the top three arms exporters to Pakistan
Between 2017 and 2021
China was the 1 weapons supplier to Pakistan
followed by Sweden
and Russia
Look at this report from 2021
Russia pledged to provide more weapons to Pakistan
despite Indias discomfort
Turning to weapon imports
the top countries importing weapons are
on this list of Top 10 Largest Arms Importers
India is at number one
followed by countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar
However whats interesting here is that
in positions 5th 7th and 10th
reveal an intriguing dynamic with  China South Korea and America
This suggests a complex game
of buying and selling weapons on the global stage
Seemingly unaffected by a countrys foreign policy
In the realm of geopolitics
the US aligns with Israel
while Russia and China form a separate bloc
even in the current crisis these two sides are evident
Russian President Putins opinion  on the IsraelPalestine war is that
it should be seen as a failure of the US policy
Asserting that the US neglects the wellbeing of Palestinians
China too condemns Israels actions in Gaza
characterizing them as beyond selfdefense
This might create the impression of a divide  with the US Europe and Israel on one side
and China and Russia on the other
However when it comes to weapon exports
these seemingly opposing nations  find themselves on the same side
These countries collectively export the most weapons globally
By now you might be thinking that  these countries are truly terrible
That we should be protesting the countries exporting weapons worldwide
But if you are thinking so you are missing the point
A nation is formed by its citizens
Americans arent bad
Neither are Russians Israelis or Chinese citizens
The citizens arent actually consulted
The major players in this deadly weapons mafia
are not everyday Americans  Russians Israelis or Chinese citizens
Ordinary people in these nations dont reap the benefits of arms sales
instead private weapons manufacturers are the ones raking in profits
Thats right
Almost all of the weapons sold globally by these countries
arent sold by the governments rather theyre sold by private capitalists
Look at this list
The top 100 weapons companies
Out of the top 100 companies
only a handful are governmentowned
such as Israel Aerospace Industries or
Aviation Industry Corporation of China
Disregarding these exceptions
the majority are private entities
Lockheed Martin an American company holds the top spot
followed by Northrop Grumman in third place
In fact 51 of the companies on the list are American
What does this mean?
The massive profits generated from the sale of weapons
flow into the coffers of these private companies
Ironically the money used to purchase these weapons often comes from
taxpayers as governments fund these acquisitions
Many nations procure weapons either from private companies in their country
or when dealing with other countries
they engage with private entities of that country
Hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayers money
are funnelled into these companies
These funds are then utilized to purchase weapons
which inevitably end up being used in  conflicts that affect ordinary people
A report by the Stockholm International  Peace Research Institute in April this year
revealed that Indias military spending
stands at 814 billion
ranking it fourth globally in 2022
At the forefront of military expenditures is America
with 877 billion
followed by China at 292 billion
and Russia at 864 billion
The top 10 list also features the UK and France
all five permanent members of  the United Nations Security Council
are on this list too
Why dont these 5 nations collectively decide
to cease the wasteful spending on weapons?
A united commitment to refrain from attacking one another
could be a transformative step to  halt the financial drain on military budgets
However the irony lies in the fact that
the primary casualties of the weapons industry
are often the American citizens
The frequency of mass shootings in America
is alarmingly higher than any other country
This year alone till midSeptember  over 500 mass shootings occurred
with a tragic impact on children
making School Shootings a  distressingly common phrase in America
In 20212022 more than 327 school  shootings took place in American schools
This is a direct result of the lax regulation  surrounding gun ownership in America
Unlike in other countries where disputes
are settled with fists and kicks
But in America people do not hesitate to fire guns
Only because of the fact that the American laws
favour gun ownership
If the sale of weapons were prohibited
no one would be allowed to sell weapons
then these gun shootings would stop eventually
But how would the weapon manufacturers benefit then?
This is why dozens of children lose  their lives in America every year
politicians are often seen shedding tears
but the gun trade isnt affected
Disturbingly between 2005 and 2020
gun sales in America tripled
In the previous year alone Americans  purchased a staggering 166 million guns
The government can easily  change this if it wanted to
Governments do not need to bow down to the weapons industry
Take Australia for example
once known for lax gun regulations
but in April 1996 when a 28yearold man  k!lled 35 people with a semiautomatic rifle
Gunman k!lls 25 people
in Australias worst massacre
The situation remains tense at the
Port Arthur side
Following this mass shooting
Australian Prime Minister John Howard took decisive action
to address the issue of firearms
The National Firearms Agreement  was implemented a month later
Between October 1996 and September 1997
the government seized over 650000 privately owned guns
The gun owners were given monetary compensation
to surrender their firearms to the government
People who had guns illegally werent compensated
but legal amnesty was provided to them
they didnt face prosecution for  voluntarily turning in their illegal weapons
As a result today in Australia
such mass shootings are rarely seen if ever
Something similar happened in Serbia earlier this year
Following two shootings in May
resulting in 17 d3aths including children
the government declared a onemonth amnesty period
for citizens to surrender their unregistered weapons
Recent mass shootings which left 17 people d3ad
and 21 wounded
have sparked public outrage
Authorities have also declared
a onemonth amnesty period
for citizens to handover unregistered weapons
or face prison sentences
Over 13500 weapons were  voluntarily surrendered within a week
Later this date was extended
and within 2 months more than 100000 illegal weapons
were handed over to the government
It shows that with political will governments can
effectively control the weapons and mitigate violence

And now lets get back to our topic
In certain regions the influence of the weapons  mafia has expanded beyond arms sales
Private companies are not only profiting from selling weapons
but have ventured into providing private armies
commonly known as Mercenaries
During the RussiaUkraine war
the Wagner group gained attention
for attempting to overthrow Putin from the government
Considered by Putin as an antinational force
the group was subsequently disbanded
But do you know how did this group form?
The Wagner group originated in Russia
Putin had said that this group
received funding from the state budget
a fact that was initially denied for years
Putin eventually admitted to allocating  1 billion to the group in a year
Dmitry Kiselyov the head of the state controlled Russian media group
stated that the Wagner group was provided  a total of 98 billion by the Russian government
Remarkably taxpayer money was  used to finance private armies
The logical question arises
Why didnt Russia use its army?
Why opt to hire private mercenary groups?
The primary motivation behind this decision  is costeffectiveness
In a wartime scenario
providing funds to a private company
allows the companys private army to  fight the war on behalf of the country
Deploying the national army is very bothersome
In the form of various financial obligations  such as pension payments
army officers salaries health insurance
and compensations for families of martyrs
Choosing to hire contract fighters is better because
once the country makes a payment to the company
the company bears all other responsibilities
Even if a mercenary of the private army d!es fighting
they arent included in the official casualty counts
While headlines may report the number of  Russian or Ukrainian soldiers k!lled
a third category exists
private army soldiers fighting
who were neither Russian nor Ukrainian
but were fighting on behalf of Russia
Their d3aths may not garner  significant attention or discussion
You might be wondering who would want to fight  as a part of a private companys armies
Friends mercenaries often hail from  economically disadvantaged countries
driven by financial constraints and limited job opportunities
they often join the army of these private companies
These private armies are not only  contracted by governments
but also by private companies and warlords
The Wagner Group for instance  engaged in conflicts beyond Ukraine
including countries like Syria Sudan Mozambique
Mali Burkina Faso and Libya
In these impoverished nations they are  frequently employed in mining contracts
The private mining companies that make money  by selling the resources of these poor nations
hire these private armies so that
they could quell local protests
Companies by Yevgeny Prigozhin mined for gold
uranium and diamonds particularly in
countries such as Sudan Mali Libya  and the Central African Republic
These private armies k!lled hundreds of innocent civilians
looting houses harassing activists  and even k!lling journalists
The Wagner Group is not the only private military company
Russia has also employed other private military companies
Like POTOK Don Brigade Moran Security Group
and Slavonic Corps ENOT Corp to name a few
Russia isnt the only one to do so
For instance Yair Klein a former Lieutenant Colonel in the Israeli Army
established Spearhead Limited a mercenary group
that supplied weapons trained d3ath squads
in rightwing paramilitary groups in Colombia
Additionally organized militias for  drug traffickers like Pablo Escobar
Despite the Colombian government seeking to arrest him
Klein just like other wealthy individuals  managed to evade legal consequences
Israel is renowned for its cyber mercenaries
who engage in cybercrimes for money
including hacking forging blackmail material disinformation spreading
planting false intelligence and surveillance
Team George an Israeli cyber mercenary group
interfered in 33 presidential campaigns
successfully influencing 27
Facebook exposed and banned 7 cyber  mercenary companies in December 2021
These companies had targetted almost 50000 people worldwide
Four of these were Israeli cybermercenaries
like Black Cube and Cobwebs
Apart from this you would have heard of Pegasus
an infamous spyware sold to governments worldwide
this was being sold by an Israeli private company
An Israeli private cyber mercenary group  called the NSO Group
Talking about America
between 1994 and 2007
approximately 300 billion was spent on 12 private militias
One of these private military company is Blackwater
founded by former US Navy officer Eric Prince
Blackwater hires fighters from various countries
including the Philippines Bosnia Israel and Chile
selling its private services for money
In September 2007
Blackwater gained notoriety when its mercenaries
k!lled 17 innocent Iraqi civilians
Although four individuals were initially being prosecuted
they were pardoned in 2020  during Donald Trumps presidency
Blackwaters involvement has contributed to  the escalation of numerous wars worldwide
In December 2021 a United Nations report
accused Eric Prince of
violating the weapons ban in Libya
The ongoing conflict in Libya
is now characterized as a private war
Look at this news article stating that  Blackwater was hired by the Obama government
to provide security in Afghanistan in 2010
at a cost of 220 million
public tax money was handed over  to these private armies
Fast forward to 2021 when the Taliban  regained control of Afghanistan
reports from the Wall Street Journal revealed that
Eric Prince was charging 6500 per person
to facilitate safe evacuations from  Afghanistan on charter flights
During the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in America
Blackwater secured a 73 million contract
to assist the FEMA staff during the  Katrinaaftermath recovery operation
Not only this Eric Prince has also made  significant political donations to Republican politicians
This intertwining of financial contributions and business transactions
works quite well here
The only difference is that
not only are the superrich businessmen corrupt
but theyre dealing in weapons transactions
k!lling people all over the world
Eric Prince handed donations to politicians
and the politicians handed his company Blackwater contracts worth 800 million
In Iraq over 160000 Blackwater employees
served as guards for US officials
An internal report from Blackwater disclosed that
among 195 shooting incidents in the last two years
the companys employees shot the first bullet in 160 instances
Its also quite common
for politicians to invest in stocks  of these private contractor companies
thereby becoming direct shareholders
This goes beyond a mere bribery situation
Any benefit made by the company would directly benefit the politician
George Bush was the US President during the Iraq invasion
his father was a Board member of the Carlyle Group
This same group was awarded numerous defense contracts
through companies like Vought and United Defense
Furthermore the then US Vice President Dick Cheney
used to be the head of the company Halliburton
which received a 7 billion defense contract  without any competitive bidding
The same company was awarded  contracts to restore the oil sector in Iraq
Now many people allege
that the real reason behind the Iraq war was
Iraqs oil
Oil companies like Halliburton  Exxon Mobil Chevron BP and Shell
established themselves in Iraq
As of December 2021
there are at least 15 influential politicians in America
actively shaping US defense policy
who have personal investments in these military contractors
They are directing US military policy
while profiting from these armsselling  companies by holding their stocks
Can there be a more drastic conflict of interest?
By now two key points should be clear
First in wars like the IsraelPalestine situation
the weapons industry reaps significant benefits
Second politicians benefit off of it too
since they are personally invested in it
especially those who have investments  in these weapon manufacturing companies
Adding to this the third point emerges
politicians often derive political benefits from wars
As poet Rahat Indori noted
Are tensions erupting on the borders? Find out if its time for elections
When politicians have to answer for  issues like corruption and unemployment
they can use wars to divert public attention
Especially for dictators
war serves as an effective distraction
George Orwells novel 1984 emphasizes the idea that
war should perpetually go on
not necessarily to win
but to continue fighting it
to maintain and consolidate power
Think about it for yourself
India refrains from attacking other nations
thats a matter of national pride
In India the military expenditures are  primarily directed towards selfdefense
especially against neighbouring countries like Pakistan and China
However when analyzing Chinas behavior
questions arise Why does China  keep on encroaching on our borders?
Does a farmer in Shanghai benefit from the Chinese intrusion?
Or some school teacher in Beijing?
This muscleflexing and chestthumping  mainly serves leaders like Xi Jinping
helping them consolidate and sustain power
In foreign policy such politicians are labelled hawkish
while those advocating for peace are termed doves
Hawkish politicians often use  public tax money to fortify their positions
In reality during wars
its the common people who end up fighting each other
not the politicians themselves
An example from 2014 highlights this
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus son
had started his mandatory threeyear army service
However this turned out to be fake news
misleading the public into thinking his son  was directly involved in the conflict
Critics have rightfully condemned
him for sending his son to  enjoy life at some American beach
while sending ordinary citizens to fight
These issues should prompt the media to  raise their voices and provide critical coverage
Unfortunately in many countries  the media is often so corrupt
that it looks to benefit from wars
eagerly chasing the prospect of increased  TRP by talking about the latest conflict
Especially those TV channels aligned with governments interest
they find it convenient
to neglect the daytoday issues faced by the common people
and focus solely on warrelated news
This highlights a stark truth about  the worlds weapons industry
an industry whose existence would be jeopardized
if global wars were to cease
Perhaps this is why it is beneficial
to continue wars to ensure the continuous flow of money
