 Jaitley ji is right that on August 15, the headlines of independence are the same
 akhbaaron ne 9 november 2016 ko waisi hi badi badi surkhiyaan lagaai hai jaisi 15 agast ke rose ke akhabaaron main chhapi thi
 For the first two or three days, and beyond, the amount of encouraging news about demonetisation was high
 sabhi bade udyogpati is faisle kii tarif hi kar rahe the or kar rahe hai
 Problems began to increase when banks opened and people did not receive cash
 in samasyaon kii khabaron se sarkaar ne bhi apane faisle lene kii gati ko behatar kiya
 The news was that the money is not being received
 bahut kam ye aalochana kar rahe the ki sarkaar ne galat faisla liya
 This is a big achievement for any government
 chaliye ek or sawaal poochhate hai
 What Gandhiji was doing when the country was immersed in the celebration of independence
 kya ve azaadi ke makasad ke saath the yaa logon kii pidaa ke saath
 
 
 Rose Gandhi was not in New Delhi on 15 August 1947
 gandhi ji 9 agast ko hi kalakatta pahunch gaye the jise aaj kolkata kehete hai
 From Kolkata, he went to Noakhali in present-day Bangladesh and returned from there to Bihar, then to Delhi in the month of September
 janvari 1948 main dilli ke dange nahin ruke to aamaran anshan par baith gaye
 Riots were taking place in Calcutta and Gandhi arrived to calm those riots
 gandhi ne kisi bhi tarah ke jashn main shaamil hone se inkaar kar diya tha
 He had said that i cannot celebrate 15 August
 main aapako dhokhaa nahin de saktaa
 But i also would not say that you do not celebrate
 durbhaagya se jo azaadi hamen mili he usamen bhavishya ke bharat or pakistan ke bich takaraav ke beej hai
 There, Gandhi would go back to shouting slogans, but still he was having a prayer meeting, Hindu Muslims were engaged in making them human again to pacify those who had gone mad in the riots
 1916 se 1947 ke bich 31 saal tak jis andolan kaa netritv kiya, jab wo andolan azaadi kii manzil par pahunchaa to gandhi us jashn se dur ho gaye
 His effort was successful
 thode hi dinon main dangon kaa ufaan shant hone laga
 Lord Mountbatten had said that 55 thousand soldiers were stationed in Punjab, yet large scale riots continued
 bengal main ek hi sipaahi tha vahaan dange ruuk gaye
 Jaitley can get some answers from this incident of Gandhi
 15 agast ko jab nehru apana aitihaasik bhaashan angrezi main pard rahe the, gandhi upwas kaa elaan kar rahe the
 He was driving a spinning wheel
 prarthana kar rahe the
 In today's era, the media is going through a grave crisis of credibility, the chances of its return to credit are becoming less and less
 tamaam raajnneetik dalon ke bade netaa aalochanaon ko lekar asahansheel hote ja rahe hai
 It is a challenge for the media to talk about the government or the public, or how to balance it
 us janata ko kya jawaab diya jaae jo kahati he ki media sirf sarkaar kii baat karti he, us sarkaar se kya kaha jaae jise lagata he ki uski baat ho hi nahin rahi he
 i again take recourse to Gandhiji
 15 agast ke baad 12 november 1947 bhi aayaa
 On this day, Mahatma Gandhi arrived at All India Radio's studio for the first time
 gandhi ne pehali baar or aakhri baar radio se sambodhan kiya
 Gandhiji had to go to Kurukshetra where he wanted to address two lakh refugees from Pakistan
 vahaan bhi log utsahit the ki gandhi ji aaenge to unase milakar apni pidaa bataayenge
 But then it was announced that Gandhi would not go to Kurukshetra for some reason and would address All India Radio
 kurukshetra ke camp main teble par murphi radio rakhaa gaya
 a loudspeaker was placed in front of him so that Gandhi's voice could reach everyone
 lage ki gandhi ji hi bol rahe hai, isliye unki tasviir bhi rakh di gai
 Gandhi did not use radio to celebrate independence
 balki hinsa or palaayan ke shikaar logon kii pidaa ko sukun dene ke liye kiya

 Gandhi reached Calcutta on August 9, which is now called Kolkata
 kolkata se ve aaj ke bangladesh main maujuud noakhli gaye or vahaan se laut kar bihar aae, phir sintabar maheene main dilli aae
 If the riots in Delhi did not stop in January 1948, they went on a fast unto death
 kalakatta main dange ho rahe the or gandhi un dangon ko shant karne pahunche the
 Gandhi refused to participate in any kind of celebration
 unhone kaha tha ki main 15 agast kii kushi nahin manaa saktaa hum
 i can't cheat you lekin main yah bhi nahin kahuunga ki aap jashn na manaayen
 Unfortunately, the freedom we have got has seeds of confrontation between India and Pakistan of the future
 vahaan gandhi waapas jaao ke naare lagate, magar phir bhi ve prarthana sabha kar rahe the, hindu muslim dangon main pagal ho chuke logon ko shant karne unhen phir se insaan banane main lage the
 When the movement he led for 31 years between 1916 and 1947, when that movement reached the destination of independence, Gandhi got away from that celebration
 unki koshish kaamyaab hui
 In a few days, the rioting boom began to calm down
 lard mountbeton ne kaha tha ki punjab main 55 hazaar sainik tainaat the phir bhi vahaan bade paimaane par dange hote rahe
 There was only one soldier in Bengal, the riots stopped there
 gandhi ke is prasang se jetali ji ko kuch jawaab mil saktaa he
 On 15 August, while Nehru was reading his historical speech in English, Gandhi was declaring a fast
 charkha chalaa rahe the
 Were praying aaj ke daur main media vishwasaneeyata ke ghor sankat se guzar rahaa he, uski saakh kii vaapasi ke asaar dinon din kam hote ja rahe hai
 Major leaders of all political parties are becoming intolerant of criticism
 media sarkaar kii baat kare yaa janata kii baat kare, yaa uskaa santulan kaisaa ho, yah ek chunauti kaa kaam he
 What answer should be given to the people who say that the media only talks about the government, what to say to the government which feels that it is not being done
 phir se gandhi ji kaa sahaara letaa hum
 After 15 August 12 November 1947 also came
 is din mahatma gandhi pehali baar aal india radio ke studio main pahunche
 Gandhi addressed the radio for the first and last time
 gandhi ji ko kurukshetra janaa tha jahaan ve pakistan se aae do lakh sharnaarthiyon ko sambodhit karnaa chaahate the
 There too people were excited that if Gandhiji comes, he will meet him and tell his pain
 lekin tabhi ghoshnaa hui ki kuch kaarnon se gandhi kurukshetra nahin jaaenge or aal india radio se sambodhit karenge
 Murphy radio was placed on the table in Kurukshetra's camp
 uske saamne laudspikar rakhaa gaya taaki sab tak gandhi kii awaz pahunch sake
 It seemed that Gandhiji was speaking, so his picture was also kept
 gandhi ne radio kaa istemaal azaadi ke jashn ke liye nahin kiya
 Rather to relieve the suffering of the victims of violence and migration
 isi liye 12 november ko jan prasaaran diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 Demonetization took place on 8 November
 chaar din baad 12 november ko dilli ke india international centre main jan prasaaran diwas manaaya gaya
 At that time Gandhi was not convinced about radio
 duusare vishwa yuddh main radio kaa istamaal propeganda ke liye zyaada hua tha
 It is not right to mention Hitler because our political debates become roadblocks as soon as Hitler's name comes
 gandhi radio ko zaruri nahin maanate the
 He felt that it is better to go and talk among people
 ve nahin chaahate the ki radio kaa prabhaav itnaa bad jaae ki mashin badi ho jaae or vyakti chota ho jaae
 It has not happened today that the channels have become big, millions of people are left behind
 aadmi chota ho gaya he
 As the anchor becomes the messiah, the reporter and his news smoke smoke
 aam logon kii khabaren gaayab hai
 There are debates on the speech of big leaders
 haalanki 1947 ke saal main radio ne gumshuda logon ko milaane kaa bada upyogi kaam kiya tha
 Information about the missing people was widely circulated
 log pareshaan hai ise sirf jivan kii ek vaastaviktaa kehane kii suvidha vitt mantri ke paas ho sakati he
 Cash is constantly being assured but the experience of the people going to the banks is not the same
 bainkon ke aage sirf kataren nahin hai
 There are many stories that should be recorded
 agar jetali ji ke anusaar notebandi ke ye pachaas din azaadi ke lamhe jaise hai to in kataron main chhipi kahaniyon ko bhi usee tarah darj kiya ja saktaa he jaise azaadi se pehle or baad ke maheenon ke dauraan us vakt ke akhbaaron main darj kiya gaya hoga
 The government was also helped by the stories of queues ahead of the banks
 uske faislon main isaki jhalak milti he
 Our colleague Saurabh Shukla met Hiradevi
 agra se dilli aakar hiradevi do teen gharon main kaam karti hai
 You can only do so much due to age
 har ghar se cash hi miltaa he
 Heera Devi did not get salary from any home today
 yahi jawaab mila ki ek hafte baad le lenaa
 Take one hundred two hundred
 abhi sara paisa nahin milegaa
 Those people are also coming in the bank line everyday
 jab unhen hi paise nahin milenge to hamen kahaan se denge
 Heera Devi's condition is bad
 ham unke ghar to nahin gaye par yakeen karte hai ki wo sahi hi bol rahi hongi
 He said that the ration of his own house is on the verge of ending
 aath taarikh ke baad se november to kisi tarah guzar gaya lekin disambar kii shuruyaat maayoos karti he
 The Finance Minister has said that the leaders and the media did not change, apart from this everything changed in the country
 sahi to kah rahe hai
 Well, everything has changed in the country, this is also true
 vaise paanch sau ke note ko lekar sarkaar kaa faisla 8 november se lekar 1 disambar tak kai baar badal gaya
 From midnight on December 2, 500 notes will not be taken in petrol pumps, gas shops
 pehle isaki taarikh 15 disambar tak thi
 But till the 15th, you can buy bus and rail tickets from the old 500 note
 neshnal haive ke toll par aap 3 se 15 disambar tak 500 ke puraane note de sakate hai
 Now you will not get free facility there
 ab aate hai ek or khabar kii taraf
 Are government officials using their subordinates to exchange notes
 dilli main ditisi main aisa hi maamla aayaa he jisaki jaanch ho rahi he
 Dozens of Haryana Roadways conductors have accused their officials of pressuring them to bring hundred rupees in exchange for old notes which are being received by the passengers
 yah report hamaare sahyogi harikishan ne bheji he
 Most of the Haryana Roadways buses were parked at the ISBT along the Kashmiri Gate in Delhi
 haryana jane vaali bason ke conduktaron ne basen khadi kar deen

 inkaa aarope he ki 25 saal ke noujvaan sahyogi sundar kii heart atake se maut ho gai kyonki flying squayred officer ne cash kii talaashi ke liye sundar ke kapade utarava kar talaashi lee
 This outraged Sundar's condition
 ye conduktaron kaa aarope he
 Conductors are not just making allegations but are saying such things that the government should take immediate care of

 To remove these misgivings, the government has made it clear that there is no provision for taxing ancestral ornaments

 There will be no inquiry up to 500 grams of gold from the married woman in case of raids
 isi tarah avivaahit mahila 250 gram sona rakh sakengi
 Men will be able to keep up to 100 grams of gold
 bainko ke aage qatari main khadey logon main se kiski kahani kya hogi kahana behad mushkil he
 An elder stood in queue since 11 am
 chaar ghante baad bhi jab paise nahin mili to bataaya ghar main patni kaa shav padaa he, antim sanskaar ke paise nahin he lekin bankwale bheetar nahin jane de rahe to line main khadey hai
 Another attempt was made by giving seriousness to the matter, the elders run towards their house with money, there is a doubt that this is not a lie, the camera chases the elderly to the house where there is a mourning of death, in so long Others had cremated in some way

 Jaitley can get some answers from this incident of Gandhi
 15 agast ko jab nehru apana aitihaasik bhaashan angrezi main pard rahe the, gandhi upwas kaa elaan kar rahe the
 He was driving a spinning wheel
 prarthana kar rahe the
 In today's era, the media is going through a grave crisis of credibility, the chances of its return to credit are becoming less and less
 tamaam raajnneetik dalon ke bade netaa aalochanaon ko lekar asahansheel hote ja rahe hai
 It is a challenge for the media to talk about the government or the public, or how to balance it
 us janata ko kya jawaab diya jaae jo kahati he ki media sirf sarkaar kii baat karti he, us sarkaar se kya kaha jaae jise lagata he ki uski baat ho hi nahin rahi he
 i again take recourse to Gandhiji
 15 agast ke baad 12 november 1947 bhi aayaa
 On this day, Mahatma Gandhi arrived at All India Radio's studio for the first time
 gandhi ne pehali baar or aakhri baar radio se sambodhan kiya
 Gandhiji had to go to Kurukshetra where he wanted to address two lakh refugees from Pakistan
 vahaan bhi log utsahit the ki gandhi ji aaenge to unase milakar apni pidaa bataayenge
 But then it was announced that Gandhi would not go to Kurukshetra for some reason and would address All India Radio
 kurukshetra ke camp main teble par murphi radio rakhaa gaya
 a loudspeaker was placed in front of him so that Gandhi's voice could reach everyone
 lage ki gandhi ji hi bol rahe hai, isliye unki tasviir bhi rakh di gai
 Gandhi did not use radio to celebrate independence
 balki hinsa or palaayan ke shikaar logon kii pidaa ko sukun dene ke liye kiya
 That's why November 12 is celebrated as Mass Broadcasting Day
 8 november ko notebandi hui
 Four days later, on 12 November, Mass Broadcasting Day was celebrated at India International Center in Delhi
 us vakt gandhi radio ko lekar aashwast nahin the
 In the second world war, radio was used more for propaganda
 hitler kaa zikr karnaa thik nahin kyonki hitler kaa naam aate hi hamaari raajnneetik bahasein sadakchhaap ho jaati hai
 Gandhi did not consider radio necessary
 unhen lagata tha ki logon ke bich jaakar baat karnaa hi behatar he
 They did not want the effect of radio to increase so much that the machine becomes large and the person becomes small
 kahin aaj ye to nahin ho gaya he ki channel bade ho gaye hai, lakhon karodon log peeche rah gaye hai
 The man is reduced
 jaise ankar maseehaa ho gaya he, reporter or uski khabaren dhuaan dhuaan
 The news of common people is missing
 bade netaaon ke bhaashan par bahasein hai
 However, in the year of 1947, radio did a very useful job of reuniting the missing people
 gumshuda logon kii jaankariyaan khub prasaarit hoti thim
 People are upset that the finance minister can only have the facility to call it a reality of life
 lagaataar cash kaa aashwaasan diya ja rahaa he lekin logon kaa anubhav bainkon ke paas jaakar vaisaa nahin he
 There are no queues just in front of the banks
 bahut si aisi kahaniyaan hai jo darj honi chahie
 If according to Jaitley ji, these fifty days of demonetisation are like the moments of independence, then the stories hidden in these queues can be recorded in the same way as the newspapers of that time during the months before and after independence
 bainkon ke aage kataron kii kahaniyon se sarkaar ko bhi madad mila
 This is reflected in his decisions
 hamaare sahyogi saurabh shukla kii mulaakaat hiradevi se hui
 Coming to Delhi from Agra, Hiradevi works in two or three houses
 umr ke kaaran itnaa hi kar sakati hai
 Cash is available from every household
 hiradevi ko aaj kisi ghar se selary nahin mili
 The same answer was received after a week
 sau do sau karke le lenaa
 You will not get all the money right now
 ve log bhi rose bank kii line main lag kar aa ja rahe hai
 When they will not get the money, then from where will they give us? hiradevi kii haalat karaab he
 We did not go to her house but believe that she must be speaking right
 unhone kaha ki unke apane ghar kaa rashan khatm hone ke kagaar par he
 November has somehow passed since the 8th, but the beginning of December disappoints
 vitt mantri ne kaha he ki netaa or media vaale nahin badale, iske alaava desh main sab badal gaya
 They are right
 vaise desh main sab badal gaya, ye bhi sahi he
 However, the government's decision on the five hundred note changed many times from November 8 to December 1
 2 disambar kii aadhi raat se 500 ke note petrol pump,gas kii dukaanon main nahin liye jaayenge
 Earlier, its date was December 15
 lekin 15 taarikh tak aap 500 ke puraane note se bas or rail kaa tikat kharid sakate hai
 On the toll of the National Highway, you can give old notes of 500 from 3 to 15 December
 ab aapako vahaan free suvidha nahin milegi
 Now come to another news kya sarkari adhikari apane maatahaton kaa istemaal kar rahe hai note badalawaane ke liye
 a similar case has come up in DTC in Delhi which is being investigated
 haryana roadways ke darjanon conduktaron ne apane adhikariyon par is baat kaa aarope lagaaya he ki un par dabaav daalaa ja rahaa he ki puraane note ke badale sau sau ke note laakar den jo yatriyon se mil rahe hai
 This report has been sent by our colleague Harikishan
 dilli ke kashmiri get vaali aiesabiti main haryana roadways kii zyaadaatar basen khadi kar di gayi
 The conductors of the buses going to Haryana parked the buses
 dharne par baith gaye
 They allege that Sunder, a 25-year-old youth aide, died of a heart attack as a flying squad officer searched Sunder's clothes to search the cash
 isse apamaanit sundar kii haalat bighad gai
 This is the charge of the conductors
 conductor sirf aarope nahin laga rahe balki aisi baaten kah rahe hai jis par sarkaar ko turant dhyaan dena chahie
 The conductors are telling that this kind of action is actually done to pressure them, the officers give the conductors daily up to ten fifteen or twenty thousand rupees in the notes of five hundred and thousand which till evening they will be returned in hundred hundred notes Have to do
 aiesabiti par do tarah ke counter hai ek to jahaan tikat katate hai or duusare jahaan tikaton kii advance booking hoti he
 The Transport Minister of Haryana acceded to the conductors and the dharna ended before the prime time began
 sundar ko das lakh kaa muawza bhi dene kaa elaan hua he
 The comments sarkaar ne kaha he ki kaala dhan ke khilaaf uskaa abhiyaan notebandi tak nahin rukegaa
 If a lot of rumors were being spread about gold, then the government has kept the matter on its side
 bataaya gaya he ki inakam tex kanoon main kiye sanshodhan main pushtaini gahanon yaa sone kii aisi julri par tex nahin lagegaa jo ghoshit aay yaa declared inakam se kharidi gai he
 Actually there were rumors that after the new income tax bill, the gold kept in the house would also come under scrutiny and it could be confiscated during the raid
 in galat fahemiyon ko dur karne ke liye sarkaar ne saafe kar diya he ki pushtaini gahanon par koi tex lagane kaa praavdhaan nahin he
 There will be no tax on gold purchased from declared income
 chapa padane kii haalat main vivaahit mahila se 500 gram sone tak koi poochtacha nahin hogi
 Similarly, unmarried women can keep 250 grams of gold
 purush 100 gram tak sona rakh sakenge
 It is very difficult to tell what the story of the people standing in front of the banks will be
 ek bujurg subah 11 baje se qatari main khadey rahe
 Even after four hours, when no money was received, the body of the wife is lying in the house, there is no money for the funeral, but the bankers are not allowed to go inside so they are standing in the line
 maamle kii gambhirtha dekar ek or koshish kii gai, bujurg paisa lekar apane ghar kii taraf daud padate hai, ek shaq bhi hota he kahin ye jhooth to nahin, camera us bujurg kaa ghar tak peechha karata he jahaan maut kaa matam he, itani der main duusare log kisi tarah sanskaar kar chuke the
 The death was diagnosed with cancer and there was no money in the house
 is din mahatma gandhi pehali baar aal india radio ke studio main pahunche
 Gandhi addressed the radio for the first and last time
 gandhi ji ko kurukshetra janaa tha jahaan ve pakistan se aae do lakh sharnaarthiyon ko sambodhit karnaa chaahate the
 There too people were excited that if Gandhiji comes, he will meet him and tell his pain
 lekin tabhi ghoshnaa hui ki kuch kaarnon se gandhi kurukshetra nahin jaaenge or aal india radio se sambodhit karenge
 Murphy radio was placed on the table in Kurukshetra's camp
 uske saamne laudspikar rakhaa gaya taaki sab tak gandhi kii awaz pahunch sake
 It seemed that Gandhiji was speaking, so his picture was also kept
 gandhi ne radio kaa istemaal azaadi ke jashn ke liye nahin kiya
 Rather to relieve the suffering of the victims of violence and migration

 chaar ghante baad bhi jab paise nahin mili to bataaya ghar main patni kaa shav padaa he, antim sanskaar ke paise nahin he lekin bankwale bheetar nahin jane de rahe to line main khadey hai
 Another attempt was made by giving seriousness to the matter, the elders run towards their house with money, there is a doubt that this is not a lie, the camera chases the elderly to the house where there is a mourning of death, in so long Others had cremated in some way
 pataa chalaa maut cancer se hui thi or ghar main paise nahin the
 People are upset that the finance minister can only have the facility to call it a reality of life
 lagaataar cash kaa aashwaasan diya ja rahaa he lekin logon kaa anubhav bainkon ke paas jaakar vaisaa nahin he
 There are no queues just in front of the banks
 bahut si aisi kahaniyaan hai jo darj honi chahie
 If according to Jaitley ji, these fifty days of demonetisation are like the moments of independence, then the stories hidden in these queues can be recorded in the same way as the newspapers of that time during the months before and after independence
 bainkon ke aage kataron kii kahaniyon se sarkaar ko bhi madad mila
 This is reflected in his decisions

 President Nasheed, ousted from power, says India's attitude is based on misleading and misinformation
 unhen ummid he ki jald hi yah galati sudhaar lee jaaegi
 44-year-old President Mohammed Nasheed, who was out of Maldives' power, was talking to his close advisers at his ancestral home in Kinerege, Male, that day
 bhartiya pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne 59 varshiya nae raashtrapati wahid hasan maanik ko samarthan kii chitthee bhej di
 After listening to this news, Anni (nasheed is known by the same name among friends) remained cheated
 kuch minute tak to ve kuch bol hi nahin paae
 According to the people present in the room, they had tears in their eyes
 nashid ke kareebi mitra or kathith takhtapalat se pehle rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar rahe amin faisal bataate hai, ''unhen laga ki jaise ek dost ne unhen sharmasaar kar diya he
 "on 8 February, Nasheed had left home to address his Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) activists that the 'infamous" Star Force (police force) began to wreak havoc
 nashid ko hardware kii ek dukaan main sharan leni padi, lekin baad main unhen pakadakar hiraasat main le liya gaya
 Nasheed was the first President of the democratically elected Maldives
 ve kehete hai ki unhen sainya-samarthit takhtapalat main satta se hataa diya gaya or isamen up-raashtrapati wahid kaa haath he
 Faisal, who was the nominated High Commissioner of Maldives to India prior to the alleged coup on February 7, says India has made a big mistake in the strategic area of the Indian Ocean
 ve kehete hai, ''main maldive kaa raksha mantri rah chukaa hum
 i know how both China and Pakistan are making tremendous efforts to make inroads here
 ham bharat ke swaabhaavik sahyogi hai
 Despite this, instead of supporting the democratically elected first president, India laid its hands on the heads of the forces that want to make Maldives the Pakistan of the Indian Ocean
 ''nashid ne bhi bharat ke ravaie par niraashaa jataai
 "india's side is based on misleading and unconfirmed information," he told India Today
 mujhe ummid he ki vah samay rahete ise durust karne ke bare main sochega
 According to Faisal, Nasheed feels that Delhi is taking him lightly and India may be weaker than China
 china is ilaake main jaan-boojhkar apni aarthik kootneeti thope rahaa he
 "the Maldives National Defense Force wanted to renew the defense deal with Beijing," says Nasheed
 jab main raashtrapati tha, ve do baar aae
 i refused
 ''china se agar yahaan sainya khatra he to pakistan samarthit charampanthiyon kaa khatra bhi kam nahin
 The way in which Wahhabi Islam is making its way into the Maldives and terrorist modules are increasing there, the strategic fraternity is worried about the danger it poses to India
 saudi arab se aae paise ke jor par pakistan maldive ke zyada se zyada naujavaanon ko wajipha de rahaa he taaki ve pakistan ke madrason main jaakar islam kii talim le saken
 India's concerns abound
 khufia afasaron kaa kahana he ki 2007 main maale ke sultan park main hui bambaari ke baad vahaan charampanthiyon ko kuchalane ke liye ek abhiyaan chalaaya gaya tha
 Many of them fled to Pakistan
 inhen main se maldive kaa naagarik ali jaleel 27 may, 2009 ko lahore sthit iesai ke daftar par hue fidaayin hamale main shaamil tha
 He was associated with Al Qaeda and video cds were recovered from his Maldives hideout, appealing to "maldivian communities" to step up in jihad
 intelligence beuro ke purv nideshak ajit dobhaal kehete hai, ''pakistan ne maldive ke nagarikon ko aatank kaa paath padhaane kaa ek abhiyaan chalaaya hua he
 The impact of extremism has increased in the Maldives society
 bharat ko zyada vyaavhaarik ravaiya apnaanaa hoga
 However, Waheed has assured India that its strategic / commercial interests in the Maldives will be protected under the new regime
 india today se baatcheet karte hue unhone bharat ke saath kareebi rishton kaa hawala diya, jagajeet singh kii gaayi pasandida ghazal tum itnaa jo muskaraa rahe ho kii kuch line gunagunaayi or jor dekar kaha ki ek baar rajnatik uthapatak shant ho jaae to bharat kaa daura unki praathamikta main sabase upar hoga
 He said, "there is nothing to worry about India
 charampanthiyon ke kabiz hone kaa koi khatra nahin he
 The story that Islamic extremists have been occupying since Nasheed's ouster is false
 ham 100 fisadi sunni muslim raashtra hai or duniya ke kisi bhi desh kii hi tarah hamaare yahaan bhi udaar or charampanthi donon kism ke log hai
 India has tremendous commercial interests in the Maldives
 jiemr samooh ibrahim nasir antarrashtriya hawaii adde ke vistaar kaary or parichaalan main laga he
 For this project it has raised Rs 2,500 crore
 kii raashi manjuur kii he
 After the coming of the new power, the review of the contract has been heard
 wahid ne patrakaron ko bataaya ki ve jiemr ke kontract ko rajnatik nazariye se nahin dekhenge, na uske vyavsaayik hiton ko chot pahunchaayenge lekin janata ke muddon ko uthaane kii koshish karenge
 The Dhivehi Qaumi Party (DQP) here has opposed the airport's operational deal with the GMR group for 25 years, alleging that Nasheed's party's personal interests were linked to the deal
 isi party ke mohammad jameel ab desh ke grih mantri hai
 Madhusudan Ganapathy, Secretary (west), Special Envoy of India in Maldives told reporters in Male, "we are negotiating from all sides and want stability restored
" ''nashid kii party amdipi kaa kahana he ki bharat kaa vanijyik nivesh yahaan joardaar tareeke se badha he
 Before 2008 it was Rs 300 crore
 hua karata tha jo 2011 main badhkar 4,500 karod ru
 Reached nashid jor dete hai, ''ek udaaravaadi or loktantric sarkaar hi bharat ke ranneetik or vanijyik hiton kii raksha kar sakati he
 There is still an opportunity for India to decide the policies given the ground reality
 '' nashid jaanate hai ki satta main unki vaapasi nahin hone vaali, na hi ve aisa kuch chaahate hai, ''meri dilchaspee jald-se-jald swatantra or nishpaksh chunaav main he
 This time, India's attitude has been completely different from 1988
 tab maldive ke tatkaaleen raashtrapati mamoon abdul gayum kii madad kii guhaar ke 12 ghante ke bheetar pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ne srilankai aatankiyon se maldive ko aaazaad karaane ke liye vishesh bal ravaanaa kar die the
 On November 3, 1988, about 80 Sri Lankan terrorists reached Male in high-speed boats and captured TV stations, telephone offices, even the presidential residence

 Mauni Amavasya 2019: dharmik drushtikon or jyotish shaastra main mauni amavasya kii tithi bahut mahatvapurn hoti he
 This is a very easy opportunity to get rid of Pitridosh
 is din pitaron ko bahut aasaani se prasann kiya ja saktaa he
 This date is known as Mauni Amavasya, due to the special importance of taking a bath on Mauni Amavasya by remaining silent and pure
 is din pavitra nadiyon main snaan karne se punya fal bhi miltaa he
 If possible, bathing in the holy rivers should please the fathers
 yadi aap pavitra nadiyon tak jane main sakasham nahin hai to apane snaan ke jal main hi ek chammach gangaajal daalkar snaan jarur karen
 Take these precautions while bathing in the morning - wake up before the sun rises in the morning
 - apane snaan ke jal main kisi pavitra nadi kaa jal yaa gangaajal jarur milaayein
 - First of all, pour this water on your head by facing towards north or east direction and then take a bath
 - snaan ke baad bhagwaan suryanarayan ko jal main til or gud daalkar arghya den
 By taking a bath in Ganga ji in the morning or adding Ganga water to the bath water in your house, all three types of physical, physical and divine sins are removed
 saath hi subah ke samay snaan karne se maa ganga kii krupa se sabhi kashton se mukti milti he
 In this way, take a bath in the morning on the morning of Mauni Amavasya
 subah ke samay mauni amavasya ke din kya daan karen-- mauni amavasya ke din daan karne kaa apana vishesh mahatv he
 On this day, food, clothes, medicines, utensils etc
 are donated to the needy people
 - mauni amavasya ke din subah ke samay aate kii goliyaan banaakar machhliyon ko daali jaati hai
 This measure ends the financial crisis

 By doing this, your sin deeds are decayed and the virtuous deeds are exposed and these virtuous deeds are helpful in fulfilling your wishes
 Perform divine remedy on the new moon day
 Bless the fathers - Arise early in the morning on the day of Mauni Amavasya and Clean the northeast corner of the house by wearing clean clothes

 The BJP, which has been so far away from mainstream in West Bengal politics, has performed brilliantly in the just concluded Lok Sabha elections and the party is eyeing to change the political equations of the state
 party ne keval do mahatvapurn darjeeling or asanasol seat par jeet hi nahin hasil kii balki teen anya seat kolkata dakshin, kolkata uttar or malda dakshin main duusare sthaan par rahi
 Overall, the party got more than 17 percent of the vote here, which is the best performance ever
 isse pehle 1991 main 13 pratishat vot praapt hua tha
 6 to the party in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 15 pratishat vot hasil hua tha
 The party has once gained a third position by making a dent in the vote base of the Left Front, a major force of West Bengal
 party kaa rajya or kendriya netritv 2016 vidhansabha chunaav main trinmul congress ke saath nikat kii ladaai ke liye apni sthiti majboot karnaa chahta he
 Political analysts believe that if the BJP maintains the same pace, then the party can manipulate the four decades old political equations in the state
 bengal prabharee bhaajapa pravaktaa siddharth nath singh ne kaha, 'party ke sheersh netritv ne mujhe kaha he ki rajya main 2016 vidhansabha chunaavon ko najar main rakhte hue is pradarshan ko majbootee dena chahie
 The next assembly election will be between Mamata and the BJP
 ' Singh, who shaped the bjp's better result in the state, feels that in the absence of credible opposition power of the Left, the anti-mamata vote will go to the bjp's account
 makapa nit vam morcha bengal main raajnneetik maujuudagi kaa bhi sankat jhel rahaa he
 Where the party got 43 in the last Lok Sabha
 66 pratishat vot mila tha, vahiin 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main yah ghatakar 29 pratishat par aa gaya
 The BJP has made the maximum dent in the party's vote base
 2011 vidhansabha chunaav ke baad se bhaajapa or aresas bengal main khaskar rajya ke gramin ilaake main paith banane kii koshish kar rahaa he or pichley teen saal main kai upachunaavon or nagar nigam chunaavon main yah najar bhi aayaa he
 Modi's attack on Banerjee during the election campaign helped the BJP garner anti-mamata votes
 raajnneetik vishleshak udayan bandopadhyaay ne kaha ki duusare rajyon kii tarah hi bengal main modi ke paksh main yaa unako vot nahin dene kaa ruukh rahaa he
 If Mamata gained a major share in the vote base that did not vote for Modi, then BJP not only won the vote that supported Modi, but also got anti-mamata votes in the Left area
 bhaajapa kii ummiido ko is tathy se bhi pankh lag rahaa he ki party rajya main 42 sansadeey kshetron main se 29 seat par tisare sthaan par rahi
 It is said that the road to power at the center passes through UP
 2019 main vipaksh khaskar mayawati or akhilesh yadav jaise upi ke do bade kshatrap bijepi or piem narendra modi ke liye isi raste ko band karne kii koshish main hai
 The two parties have come together to stop Modi and Amit Shah's Vijay Rath
 rajyasabha chunaavon main bispi ummidavaar kii haar se bhi inke hausale post nahin hue hai or bijepi ke liye ye chintaa badhaane kii baat he kyonki agar maaya-akhilesh kaa gathbandhan 2019 main bijepi ke khilaaf maidan main utraa to 2019 main bijepi ke liye soobe main 2014 jaise nattejey doharaana mushkil hi nahin, naammumkin ho jayega
 UP decides the way to Delhi When it is said that the path of power of Delhi passes through Uttar Pradesh, the political history of the country is behind it
 upi ne ab tak sabase zyada pradhanmantri die hai
 There are 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 yani centre main sarkaar banane ke liye jitani siten chahie uski kareeb ek tihaai
 The BJP alliance won 73 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when its mission was successful 272 plus
 un chunaavon main basapa kaa khaataa bhi nahin khulaa tha
 The Congress was limited to Rae Bareli and Amethi
 jabaki sapa sirf apane parivaar kii paanch siten jeet saki thi
 But these results are when the SP, BSP and Congress were in a different ground against the BJP
 haal hi main hue gorakhpur or phulpur upachunaav main jab sapa or basapa saath aae to bijepi apni 2 siten haar gai
 For the second time, the results of the SP-BSP alliance in Gorakhpur and Phulpur have filled the SP-BSP with hope
 pehali baar 1993 main ramamandir andolan ke daur main bijepi kii lahar ko rokane ke liye kanshiram or mulaayam singh ne haath milaayaa tha
 This had the effect that the BJP could not come to power in the state
 ab dobaaraa 25 saal baad phir sapa-basapa gathbandhan ko taiyaar hai
 This time the target is not the state but the Modi government at the center
 sapa-basapa kaa mulvot 52 fisadisapa-basapa ke saath aane se bijepi kii raah 2019 main kaaphi mushkil ho jaaegi
 Both parties have a strong vote bank in the state
 soobe main 12 fisadi yadav, 22 fisadi dalit or 18 fisadi muslim hai
 The SP-BSP has a strong hold over these three classes and together they constitute around 52 per cent
 yani pradesh ke aadhe voter sidhe-sidhe sapa or basapa ke prabhaav kshetra vaale hai
 Apart from these, the vote of other OBC community can also go to the account of these two parties
 aise main bijepi ke liye 2014 ke chunaav nattejey doharaana mushkil hoga
 42 in 2014
 30 fisadi vot the bijepi ke2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko 42
 30 percent votes were received
 inke dam par bijepi ne 71 siton par jeet hasil kii
 At the same time, SP-BSP got 41 in total
 80 fisadi vot mili the
 7 to Congress then
 5 fisadi vot mili the
 That is, even if SP, BSP and Congress contested elections in 2019 and voting like 2014 Modi wave, BJP will lag behind the opposition parties, winning 73 seats is a distant thing
 agar is mahagathbandhan main areldi jaisi choti partiyaan bhi saath jud gayi to bijepi ke liye upi ek bura sapana sabit ho saktaa he
 On the other hand, if only the SP-BSP contested the elections, the BJP would lose almost half of its last won seats
 kehane kii jarurat nahin he ki tab bijepi ke upi main 2019 main 80 seat jeetne ke mishan kaa kya hashr hoga

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has decided to contest Lok Sabha elections from Wayanad seat in Kerala along with his traditional parliamentary seat Amethi
 rahul ke is faisle ko virdohi dal unki kamajori bataa rahe hai
 Bharatiya Janata Party leader and Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has quipped that the Congress President is feeling uneasy, insecure and helpless in Amethi
 lekin kya vaaki rahul gandhi ke liye amethi main apane parivaar kii viraasat ko majbootee se aage badhanaa mushkil gaya he, yaa phir unhone dakshin kii raajnneeti main party ko gati dene ke makasad se ek or seat chunane kaa nirnay liya he
 The Amethi parliamentary seat is considered an impregnable fort of the Congress
 is loksabhaa seat par ab tak 16 aam chunaav or 2 upachunaav hue hai
 Of these, the Congress has won 16 times
 bijepi ne amethi main 1998 main jeet darj kii thi, jabaki usase pehle ek baar 1977 main yahaan se janata party ne baaji maari thi
 Apart from these two elections, no other party other than Congress has been able to win any election from Amethi
 haalanki, 2014 main jab narendra modi ke naam par bijepi ne puure desh main jabardast jeet hasil kii or upi kii 80 main 71 siton par apana paracham laharaaya to amethi seat par bhi bijepi ummidavaar ne rahul gandhi ke daant lagbhag khattey kar die
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Rahul Gandhi contested on a Congress party ticket and he was pitted against BJP candidate Smriti Irani
 rahul gandhi ko is chunaav main kul 4,08,651 vot mili, jabaki duusare number par smriti irani raheen or unhone 3,00,748 vot hasil kiye
 That is, the difference of Rahul's victory was just 1 lakh 7 thousand 903 votes
 yun to ek lakh se zyada maton kii jeet bhi kam nahin maani jaati, lekin rahul gandhi ke puure kariyar main unki jeet kaa yah margin sabase kam tha
 Another interesting statistic is that out of the total 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, 24 seats were such, on which the margin of victory was close to one lakh or less
 yani modi lahar main bijepi ke sabhi chote-bade pratyaashiyon ne do lakh se lekar teen-chaar lakh maton ke antar se chunaav jeeta tha
 Smriti Irani, who addressed Amethi residents through video conferencing, got Rahul 66 in 2004
 2% vot2004 main pehali baar loksabhaa chunaav ladane vaale rahul gandhi ne amethi seat se hi ladate hue 3,90,179 vot (66
 2%)
 jabaki 99,326 (16
 8%) with Bahujan Samaj Party candidate Chandra Prakash Mishra was second
 tisare number par bijepi ke ramvilas vedanti rahe the or unhen kul 55,438 (9
 4%) votes
 yani rahul gandhi ne apana pehla chunaav hi 2 lakh 90 hajaar se zyada maton se jeeta tha
 After this, the graph of Rahul Gandhi went higher in the second election
 2009 main rahul ko mili 71
 When the first election was fought by 8% Voterahul Gandhi, the NDA government was led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee at the center, but when the Congress was in power in 2009 and Rahul contested his second election from Amethi, the rival candidates collapsed in front of him
 rahul ne 4,64,195 vot hasil karte hue kul maton kaa 71
 Took 8% share
 jabaki bahujan samaaj party ke ashish shukla 93,997 vot paakar duusare number par rahe or bijepi pratyaashee pradeep kumaar singh ko mahaj 37,570 vot mili
 Rahul got 46 in 2014
 7% vot2014 main jab narendra modi ke netritv main smriti irani amethi ke ran main utrin to bijepi kaa vot 5
 Jumping 8% to 34 straight
 4% pahunch gaya or rahul gandhi kaa sensex 71
 46 down from 8%
 7% par aa tikaa
 Whereas the BSP, which always competed against the Congress candidate, slipped to the third position and its candidate was just 6
 6 fisad vot mil paae
 The famous poet Kumar Vishwas also tried his best to challenge the Aam Aadmi Party ticket, but he was able to get only 25 thousand votes
 shaayad ye aankade hi bijepi ko yah daawa karne kaa aadhaar de rahe hai ki rahul gandhi amethi main asahaj mahasoos kar rahe hai
 But the caste equation of Amethi Lok Sabha constituency and Bahujan Samaj Party contesting from this seat can also be considered a big factor in Rahul Gandhi's favor
 darasal, amethi loksabhaa seat par dalit or muslim matadaata kingmekar kii bhoomika main hai
 The Muslim voters here are close to 4 lakh and about three and a half lakh voters are Dalits
 inamen paasi samudaay ke voter kaaphi achche hai
 Apart from this, Yadavs, Rajputs and Brahmins are also very well in this seat
 sapa amethi se apana pratyaashee nahin utaarti he or is baar gathbandhan main lard rahi basapa ne bhi amethi se koi pratyaashee na utaarne kaa nirnay liya he
 In such a situation, the Congress can take a sigh of relief seeing this equation that this time with its traditional votes, Rahul Gandhi can get success in continuing his winning chariot by getting a good vote of Dalit and Yadav society
 lekin is sikke kaa doosraa pahalu ye bhi he ki daliton kaa jo rujhaan bijepi kii taraf dekha gaya he, vaise main agar bijepi basapa or sapa se jude votaron ko apni taraf khinchne main kaamyaab ho paati he, to rahul gandhi ke liye amethi asurakshit ban saktaa he

 This time in the Rajasthan assembly elections, everyone's eye is on the Tonk assembly
 pichley 46 saalon main pehali baar congress ne yahaan alpsankhyak ummidavaar nahin utaara he, to 38 saal baad pehali baar bijepi ne yahaan koi alpsankhyak ummidavaar utaara he
 The candidate from the Congress is Rajasthan Pradesh Congress President Sachin Pilot and the BJP candidate is the number two minister in the Vasundhara government, Yunus Khan
 'payalat' ke khilaaf bijepi ke diggaj 'younus'rajasthan kaa tonk jila nawabon kii riyasat hua karti thi
 The town of Tonk was settled by Aamir Khan Pindri, just south of the Banas River
 19 november ko rajasthan congress ke pradesh adhyaksh sachin payalat ke namakan ke saath hi tonk ek baar phir se charchaa main he
 As soon as the name of Sachin Pilot was decided by the Congress from this seat, BJP also fielded veteran minister Younus Khan of Vasundhara government by cutting the ticket given to sitting MLA Ajit Mehta
 tonk vidhansabha kaa siyaasi samikarngauratalab he ki 1972 se lekar 2013 tak tonk se congress keval muslim pratyaashee hi utaarti rahi he
 Whereas from 1980 to 2013, BJP has fielded only Hindu candidates here
 tonk kii siyasat ko ab tak hindu or musalmaan ke nazariye se dekha jaataa rahaa he, lekin is baar siyasat kii hawa ulti bah rahi he
 BJP has always fielded Jain candidates from Tonk till now as the laboratory of the Sangh
 jain ummidavaar congress ke muslim ummidavaar ke saamne hindu cheharaa rahaa he
 This time politics has become casteist rather than communal
 tonk main sachin payalat ke sajaateey gurjar matadaataaon kii sankhya kareeb 45 hajaar he, to vahiin 70 hajaar muslim matadaata hai
 SC-ST also has around 80 thousand votes on this seat
 sachin payalat kii taraf se ganit lagaaya gaya ki yadi alpsankhyak, essi-asti or gurjar matadaata saath aate hai to tonk, sachin kaa ajey durg ban jayega
 It is no coincidence that at midnight of 15 November, it was announced that Sachin Pilot would contest the first assembly election of his political life from Tonk assembly constituency
 sachin pehle se the taiyarbataya ja rahaa he ki sachin payalat kii najar tonk vidhansabha par kaaphi pehle se thi
 When the party was going on a rampage over the election ticket in Delhi, there was a sudden news that on an afternoon flight, Sachin Pilot came from Delhi to Jaipur and held a meeting of Gurjar Samaj
 jiske baad shaam ko waapas dilli chale gaye
 Then there was a discussion among people that why did Sachin Pilot suddenly come and go to Tonk? At that time, it was said that the Gurjar leaders had called him after giving an ultimatum on his mind
 lekin isse pataa chalata he ki payalat ne pehle se taiyaari kar rakhi thi
 Tonk had never seen such a crowd in Sachin Pilot's nomination
 badi sankhya main alpsankhyak or gurjar voter sachin payalat ke road sho main chal rahe the
 Sachin Pilot says that he had not made any plans for Tonk, it was just Rahul Gandhi's order
 payalat gaanvon main jaakar samaaj ke logon ke saath khaanaa khate hai or bate karte hai
 Explain to them that in this election, if the Hindus and the Muslims do the BJP, then do not get caught in their affair
 younus khan bijepi ke turup kaa ikkaa yaa bali kaa bakra?udhar bijepi ne bhi nai chaal chali or yahaan par bijepi ke alpsankhyak poster bvoy younus khan ko namakan se 3 ghante pehle maidan main utaar diya
 The big question is whether Yunus Khan is the trump card for the BJP or has the party made him a scapegoat? It is neither understood by Younus Khan nor the people of Tonk
 younus khan ko tonk main bheed jutaney ke liye apane kshetra deedwanaa se bheed bulani padi
 At the time of his nomination, Younis Khan told the people that he has come to serve as a servant, Sachin Pilot is the king, where will he meet, if you choose us, we will meet again and again
 younus khan ko tikat dene kii kahani bhi dilachasp he
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (ASS) did not want to field Yunus Khan in the assembly elections this time, but Chief Minister Raje stood in front of the Union to field Yunus Khan from Didwana assembly constituency
 aakhirkaar vasundhara raaje aadhi adhuri jeet hasil kii
 Did not get Didwana but after extinguishing it, Yunus Khan was sent to Tonk
 udhar sangh ne bhi adhuri haar sweekaar kii
 Did not give Didwana but agreed to field Muslim candidate Yunus Khan in Tonk, the stronghold of the Sangh
 rajasthan: aakhir payalat or gahalot ko chunaav ladaane ko kyon majaboor hue rahul gandhi?bijepi ne chaal to chali he ki alpsankhyak ummidwar ke naam par 70 hajaar alpsankhyak voton main send laga kar jeet lenge lekin tonk ke alpsankhyak gramin rahe hai jinaki maansikta alag andaaj kii rahi he
 The area of tonk-malpura is known for most communal riots
 tonk kii pahchaan yahaan kaa ghantaghar to rahaa hi he, yahaan bakreed ke din bakre kii jagah unt kii qurbaani bhi di jaati rahi he
 bjp's strategy is not known but it is being said that this time because of Sachin Pilot, Hindus and Muslims are seen together which is good for Tonk
 kya hai tonk ke mudde?rajasthan kaa tonk jila ek pichhadaa hua gramin ilaaka he, jahaan par suvidhaon ke naam kii koi cheez nahin he
 For a long time people have been demanding that there should be at least a railway station and a railway line here
 yah ilaaka kisaanon kaa ilaaka he jahaan par 80 fisadi aabaadi kheti par nirbhar he
 The people of the village say that this time they have high hopes from Sachin Pilot
 sachin payalat yuva he
 They have access to Delhi
 ajmer or dausa main unhone bahut vikaas kiya he
 People are hoping that Tonk will develop in the same way
 tonk main hi rajasthan kaa sabase bada jalashay bisalpur dam he, jahaan se jaipur kii pyaas bujhati he lekin tonk ko logon ko pani nahin miltaa
 In the previous Vasundhara government, there was firing on farmers seeking water in Sohela and then 5 farmers were killed
 yahaan par kisaanon kii duusari badi samasya fasalon kaa sahi mulya nahi milanaa he
 The central government declares that their crop will be purchased at the support price, but they fly it with middlemen
 ilaake main sabase zyada bajra hota he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had told people in Rajasthan rallies that he has increased the support price of Bajra by two and a half times
 lekin bajre kii kheti khatm ho gai, fasal bazaar main bik rahaa he par samarthan mulya par bajre kaa ek dana nahin kharida gaya
 Because of which farmers are feeling cheated

 loksabhaa chunaav khatm hote hi or nai sarkaar kaa gathan hone ke turant baad bhartiya janata party kii saathi shivasena ne sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa he
 The Shiv Sena, through its mouthpiece Saamana, cursed the Modi government on the issue of unemployment-bullet train
 yahaan likhaa gaya he ki sirf vigyaapan dene se rojgaar paidaa nahin hoga, koi ection bhi lenaa hoga
 Explain that the Shiv Sena is also a participant in the Modi government and its MP Arvind Sawant has been made a cabinet minister
 somvaar ko saamana main likhaa, ‘berogari ke aankade or jidipi main giravat modi sarkaar ke liye chintaa kaa vishay he
 Jobs will not be provided just by advertising
 iske alaava bullate train project se kisi ko rojgaar nahin mil rahaa he’
 Apart from this, it has been said that the status of the Prime Minister's Skill Development Scheme is also not good, its results should be reviewed continuously
 modi sarkaar-2 par shivasena kaa ye pehla or karaara hamalaa he
 It is written in Saamana that Nitin Gadkari is saying that unemployment has been an issue for not just 5 years but decades but then why 2 crore jobs were promised

 He said in the press conference after the game ended on the fourth day, "bumrah was doing very well before he made his Test debut because of his bowling action, we had full faith in him and most of his bowlers faced The batsmen said that his balls were very difficult to understand
 ’australian team duusari pari main aath wicket ganvaakar 258 ran banaakar jujh rahi he or shanivaar ko chauthe din bhartiya tej gendbaajon ne paanch wicket saajha kiye

 He said, 'I got an opportunity to work with Bumrah when i was in the NCA when he played at the under-19 level
 mujhe laga ki bumraah apane ection se kaaphi tej gendbaaji kar sakate hai, lekin isse unke sharir par asar padataa he

 Give yourself some time
 offis kii pareshaaniyon ke bare main apane manager se baat karen
 Make a career by doing these courses of GST, you will earn good 2
 asal vajah ko pahachaane:naukari chhodane kaa faisla lene se pehle khud se kuch sawaal karen
 For example, isn't this the job you wanted to do from the beginning
 kya aapkaa job aapaki nijee jindagi main dakhal de rahaa he
 3
 apane bos kii baat bhi sunen: apek liye jaananaa jaruri he ki aapkaa bos aapke istife ko kis tarah se legaa
 Give him a chance to solve your problem too
 4
 What will be the consequences of leaving the job: You should know very well what will be the consequences of leaving the job
 aapako kitni jaldi nai naukari milegi
 5
 saare data ko hataa den:naukari chhodane se pehle apane offis ke computer se saare personal contacts or personal data hataa den
 If you want to earn big, then start online business 6

 7

 je
 Akbar and BJP spokesman Shahnawaz Hussain arrived
 inke alaava bijepi shasit rajyon ke kai muslim mantriyon samet kai muslim deshon ke rajdooton ne bhi iftaar daavat main shirkat kii
 Raised the issue of Uniform Civil Code On the occasion of the party, Indresh Kumar, the guide of the Muslim Rashtriya Manch and member of the National Executive of the RSS, raised the triple talaq case of Muslim society by breaking the Uniform Civil Code
 unhone kaha ki abhi tak jitne bhi muslim dharmaguruon ke saamne tripal talaak kii baat kii he, unhone yahi kaha ki khuda ko talaak naapsand tha
 He told the people of Muslim society that there should be a healthy debate on this
 zyaadaatar dharmaguruon ne unke suzav kii prashansa kii
 Uniform Indresh Kumar will not stop here with a common law
 unhone kaha ki muslim samaaj ko ye tay karnaa hoga ki unke liye alag kanoon acha he
 Their development will be more for everyone under a common law
 daramil muslim rashtriya manch ke jariye muslimon main ek nai bahes chhadate hue indresh kumaar sangh ke agenda ko aage badha kar samaan nagirak samhita kanoon ko lagu karne main sarkaar kii raah aasaan kar rahe he
 Not good atmosphere in Pakistan about India Indresh Kumar made it clear that the Muslim National Forum canceled the invitation sent to Pakistan in this iftar party because there is an atmosphere against India
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki 1947 main vibhaajan se pehle ek muslim mahila kii ek gavaahi maani jaati thi lekin aaj pakistan main ek mahila kii gavaahi ko aadhi gavaahi mana jaataa he
 He also said that Pakistan should not forget that 7 different organizations keep demanding to separate from Pakistan
 muslim rashtriya manch se sangh ne kiya khud ko alagavaisearesasane muslim rashtriya manch se ye kehete hue kinaaraa kar liya he ye ek swytt sanstha he lekin samay-samay par agar sanstha ko jarurat padati he to sangh apni raay detaa he or sangh ne iske samanvay kii jimmedaari indresh kumaar ko di he
 Some such arguments have been made for the Sangh BJP and VHP as well, but the relationship between Sangh BJP and VHP is not hidden from anyone
 har koi is baat se waakif he ki bijepi or viechpi kis tareeke se sirf or sirf sangh ke agenda ko aage badhaane ke liye kaam karte hai
 The Sangh seems to be keeping distance from the Muslim national platform because the word Muslim does not match the ideology of the RSS

 Don't know which disease Asaram has, which only his lady Vaidya Neeta can cure
 medical science dhokhaa kha gaya, doctor chakra gaye lekin asaram hai ki kehete hai ki unki beemaari kaa ilaaj sirf nita ke hatho main he or tabhi adaalat se guhaar lagaakar asaram apni beemaari ke liye maang rahe hai shuddh desi ilaaj
 Asaram sent a letter to the judge in the District and Sessions Court of Jodhpur on 4 September
 us khat main likhaa kiseva main, mananeey jila evam seshan nyaayadhishjila- jodhpur (raaj
 ) Honorable, subjective article that i have been suffering from a disease called Trinadi Shul since last thirteen and a half years and i am being treated by Vaidya Nitaji for the last 2-3 years
 jo mukhyat: panchakarma kaa ek bhaag shirodhara dwaara upachaar karti hai, jisamen kareeb do ghante kaa samay lagata he
 Therefore, you are requested to take action on the request of Vaidya to call Nitaji in the Central Jail every day for the next eight days for the treatment of my above mentioned illness
 santashri asaram bapkepani hi jubaan se khud ko santashri kehane vaale asaram ke khat par adaalat ne buudhvaar ko bhi sunwaayee kii or phir guuruuvaar ko bhi
 For half an hour on Thursday, the court kept on cross-examining whether to send Nita to Asaram or not
 peedit ladki ke vakil manish vyas ne daleel di ki trinadi shul jaisi koi beemaari nahin hoti
 At this, Asaram's lawyer argued that Asaram has been suffering from the disease for 13 years
 vaidya nita hi unka ilaaj karti rahi hai
 Therefore, they should be allowed treatment
 is par peedita ke vakil ne kaha ki medical check-ap se saaf ho chukaa he ki asaram puri tarah swasth hai
 However, if they need a female doctor, then they should ask Asaram once again about this
 jawaab main asaram ke vakil ne kaha ki thik he
 We will talk to Asaram whether he needs treatment for Neeta or not
 is par jaj ne mangalvaar ko agali sunwaayee kii taarikh suna di
 The desire for bail on the court frame is currently incomplete and unconscious, but the desire of the woman doctor is also stuck in the court
 trinadi shul urf anant vaat urf trigeminal neuralgia
 Three names of a disease
 allopath main trigeminal neuralgia, ayurveda main anant vaat or asaram kii jubaani trinadi shul
 Asaram, who is in jail on charges of sexual exploitation of a minor girl, is asking for a valid legal treatment for two hours every day by citing the same disease 
 nita ke mutabik is trinadi shul beemaari main nasm, shirodhara or karnpuran ilaaj kiya jaataa he
 If pain increases for a long time, eight consecutive days have to be performed, which takes about an hour and a half
 ayurveda ko jaanane vaale aisi beemaari ko to maanate hai, lekin iske ilaaj ke liye mahila vaidya hi chahie, ye unke gale nahin utarataa
 But Amrit Prajapati, who was a doctor of Asaram till a few years ago, believes that all this is an excuse for Asaram
 asli makasad to opium paanaa he
 That too for Sambhak Yoga i
e
 to increase sex power
 lekin angreji dawaaon ke jaankaron kaa kahana he ki agar asaram ko trigeminal neuralgia jaisi beemaari he to uskaa samuchit ilaaj ho saktaa he
 Asaram's disease is a matter of investigation and research for many
 haalanki jail jane ke baad jab unka medical check-ap hua to 72 saal ke asaram bilkul tandurust nikle
 Meanwhile, in the debate, now everyone's eyes are set on the District and Sessions Court of Jodhpur, where the next hearing is to be held on Tuesday whether Asaram has the disease of Trinidual colic and whether it will be a pure home remedy - through Vaidya Neeta
 asaram ne adaalat se apni beemaari kii guhaar lagaayi thi
 The disease, which a woman Vaidya Neeta can cure, but Amrit Prajapati, an old Vaidya who once treated Asaram, opened his second pole
 prajapati ke mutabik asaram opium kaa istemaal karte hai or uske liye ek nayaa code verde diya he panched booti
 Asaram's Panched Ashram is about 17 km from Ratlam
 prajapati ke mutabik vahaan par asaram khud hi opium kii kheti karavaate hai or vahaan se apane liye hameshaa opium mangavate hai
 It was named Panched Booti after the same ashram
 prajapati ke mutabik asaram kai baar unase kamini mardan, ashwagandha, shilajeet, makardhvaj ras jaisi sexvardhak dawaaen mangavaya karte the
 In such a situation, Asaram's disease is covered in many questions
 ek taraf jail ke andar baba tadap rahe hai to duusari taraf jail se baahar unki mahila vaidya baichaiyn ho rahi hai
 As much as Baba is worried about his illness, his lady doctor is even more worried about not being able to treat him
 yani jo haal baba kaa jail ke andar he, vahi haal unki vaidya kaa jail ke baahar
 If i do not call it Baba's great glory, what else can i say, who has made the doctor worse than the patient
 pune ke tilak ayurveda college se ayurvedacharya kii degree hasil karanevaali vaidya nita kii jindagi pehle aisi nahin thi lekin 1998 main unhone asaram se diksha kya lee, bas wo baba ke liye samarpit ho kar rah gayi or ab unka yahi samarpan in dinon rajasthan ke is shahar main saafe dikh rahaa he

 Raman made his debut in cricket, but unfortunately the ending was sad and not forgettable

 His death shocked the cricket world

 Two people on a bike behind also stopped their bikes
 phir achaanak hi bikeron ne kisi ko phone kiya or do bike par aae chaar-paanch logon ne unki taxi ko gher liya
 Before the trio could understand something, the miscreants on the bike started fighting with them

 Describing himself as an anti-narcotics cell policeman, he asked the girls to walk with him
 ab takadonon ladakiyon or taxivoleko dur-dur tak bhi ye gumaan nahin tha ki wo pulisavaale nahin hai
 It seemed to the driver that they might want to take the taxi to a police station for investigation
 lekin iske ulat bike par aae badmaash taxi ko sidhe arapora ilaake ke ek ghar main lekar gaye or chaanbin ke naam par teenon ko kaid kar liya

 is dauraan badmaashon ne teenon se unke paas maujuud rupye paise to luute hi, ek atm tak le ja kar or unke account se bhi rupee nikalava liye

 But late at one and a half hours, one of his tricks suddenly worked
 usne badmaashon se kaha ki ab agar wo ghar nahin pahunchaa, to use dhundhate hue uske ghar ke log kahin police ke paas naa chale jaaen
 Just after hearing the name of the police, the miscreants started to fear the destruction of the buffalo and they liberated the driver at the same time
 wo sidhe ghar pahunchaa
 But he kept waiting outside the house in the morning and then along with his family members reached the police
 nae thikaane par kiya gangreparaat ko driver ko chhod dene ke baad badmaash ladakiyon koek or thikanaper le kar gaye or vahaan unhone donon ke saath gangrape kiya
 On the other hand, the driver told the police about the whole incident of abducting the girls and also told that the crooks are demanding one and a half lakh rupees to release the girls
 bas, police ne badmaashon kii isi laalach kaa phayda uthaaya or phone ke jariye hi unhen giraftaar karne kaa puraa jaal bicha liya
 Now this driver sitting in the police station kept talking to the miscreants on the phone and the police started trying to intercept their telephone

 is kaam se kaidiyon main samaaj kaa hissaa hone kii bhaavana penpegi, jiskaa unki maansikta par sakaaratmak asar hoga
 In order to implement the government scheme, people imprisoned in the Kolhapur jail on charges ranging from theft to blood are making offerings to God
 25 saal se 50 saal tak kii umr ke 15 purush or 15 mahila qaidi har din 3 hajaar motichur ke laddu banaaenge
 The jail will hand over the jail administration after making these laddus and then every laddu will be sold as a prasad to the devotees for 10 rupees
 navaratri or anya utsav ke maukey par kolhapur jail prashasan atirikt kaidiyon kii madad se laddu kii adhiktam maang puri kar dikhaane kaa daawa kar rahaa he
 The comments is yojana se na mandir trust isse munaafaa nahin kama rahaa he na sarkaar
 Despite this, the campaigner is raising objections
 sanathan sanstha ke pravaktaa abhaya vartak kaa maananaa he ki is se bhakton par tamogun kaa prabhaav adhik ho saktaa he
 Talking to NDTV India, Vartak said that due to the crime of the prisoner, the excess of tamoguna present in it is self-evident
 isliye sanathan is project kaa virodh karata he
 They further ask, will those who defend this mission eat tiffin made by the prisoners in their homes? udhar, tamaam virodhon ke baavjood jail prashasan apane faisle par kaayam he
 At the same time, it is also claiming to have cleanliness in place of making prasad of God
 apane daawey kii pushti ke liye devi ko bhoga chadhaane se pehle use banane kii jagah kuch sthaneey log or media ke numaayindon ko bhi dikhaai gai

 Neither the temple trust nor the government is making any profit from this scheme
 baavjood is muhim par aapatti uthaa rahi he
 Sanatan Sanstha spokesperson Abhay Vartak believes that this can have a greater impact of tamoguna on devotees
 NDTV india se baatcheet main vartak ne kaha ki kaidi se hue aparaadh ke chalate usamen maujuud tamogun kii adhikta swayanspasht he
 Therefore Sanatan opposes this project
 ve aage poochhate hai ki is muhim kii pairvi karanevaale kya apane ghar main kaidiyon ke haath kaa bana tifin khaaenge? On the other hand, despite all the protests, the jail administration is firm on its decision
 saath hi bhagwaan kaa prasad banane kii jagah par safasafai rakhane kaa daawa bhi kar rahaa he
 Some local people and media representatives were also shown the place of making it before offering it to the goddess to confirm her claim
 udhar, tamaam virodhon ke baavjood jail prashasan apane faisle par kaayam he
 At the same time, it is also claiming to have cleanliness in place of making prasad of God

 Two photographs came out of the valley after the Pulwama attack
 kaayade se ye dono tasviren ek nae kafile kii shuruyaat hai
 First thing first picture
 kashmir ghati main jab bhi hamaare javaanon kaa kafila sadak par hoga to uske aasapaas bhi ab kisi duusari gaadi ko fatakane kii ijaajat nahin hogi
 Even if someone tried to overtake the convoy or enter the convoy, it would be considered a rebellion
 ek baar sena kaa kafila haive par pahunch gaya to phir aam trephic tab tak rukii rahegi jab tak ki kafila guzar nahin jaataa
 Now there will be armed men on the roof of every army car
 laal jhanda dikhaa kar rasta clear karne kaa ishaara karegaa
 Along with the convoy, there will be a mines protected vehicle
 kaafila guzarane ke dauraan aam gadiyon kii movement par roak hogi
 Aajtak's team traveled with the army convoy after the Pulwama attack
 wo jammu-srinagar neshnal haive tha
 Which is 295 km long
 jammu se kashmir ghati jane or ghati se jammu aane kaa iklauta rasta
 The CRPF convoy was attacked on February 14, near mile stone number 272 of this national highway
 is neshnal haive samet ghati ke alag-alag hisson main lagbhag har rose sena or suraksha balon kii saikadon gaadiyaan guzarati hai
 And along with these passing trains, the trains of common people also run
 or aisi hi ek gaadi 4 farvaki ko pulavama ke kareeb achaanak saamne ai or siarpief ke kafile se ja takaraai thi
 But after the Pulwama attack, many changes have been made to protect the army convoy in the valley
 inhen tabdiliyon kaa gavaah bani vaardaat kii team
 Our colleague Gaurav Sawant became a companion of one such army convoy in North Kashmir
 ab sena ke kafile ke guzarane dauraan raste main yaa kisi bhi mode par aam gadiyon ke chalane par tab tak roak hogi jab tak ki kafila vahaan se guzar nahin jaataa
 In this, people may have to wait for ten to twenty minutes
 yani ab jaise hi sena kaa kafila haive par pahonchega, sari gadiyon roak di jaaengi or logon ke paidal chalane par bhi roak hogi
 After clearing the way, Mines Protected Vehicle was running at the forefront of this army convoy
 taaki kisi bhi tarah ke khatre se wo nipat sake
 On the roof of every vehicle, a young man was keeping a vigil on the whole path with weapons
 taaki koi bhi aam gaadi yaa shaks kafile ke bich main yaa kafile ke saamne achaanak aane kii koshish kare to use roka ja sake
 The jawans are giving a signal to the common vehicles to move out of the way by whistling and showing the red flag
 sena ke kafile ke muvament ko lekar jo nai tabdiliyaan hui hai usak mutabik sena ke har kafile ke liye ab dianemic convoy muvament rule hoga
 No civil train will pass on the route during that time
 civil gadiyon ko rokane kii zimmedaari police kii hogi
 Showing a red flag would mean the car stops where it is
 laal jhanda cross karne vaali gadiyon ko vidrohi mana jayega
 The traffic will stop for 15 to 20 minutes while the Convoy passes
 army haive domineshman team har convoy ko aage, bich main or peeche se suraksha degi
 Those trying to get in Convoy's way or overtake would also be considered rebels
 darasal, ab tak sena kaa kafile ke saath hi aam gaadiyaan bhi gujara karti thim
 However, it has been talked about many times before that due to security reasons, trains of common people should not come in the middle of the army convoy
 magar dikkat sabase zyada jammu-srinagar neshnal haive par thi
 Traffic is high here and it is difficult for the convoy to stop the normal traffic
 lihaaza ek vichaar ye bhi aayaa tha ki sena ke kafile kaa movement raat ke liye hi simit kar diya jaae
 Because at night the traffic on the highway is very less
 lekin raat ke safar ko lekar kuch dikkatein bhi thim isliye is par amal nahin ho paaya

 Asian and defending world champions India are considered to be strong contenders for the title but after losing to Korea in their very first match, their reputation began to be discounted

 bharat ne duusare half main 22 ank jutaaye lekin australia ne bhi is half main khel main sudhaar karte hue 13 ank jutaaye
 The hosts added 35 points from the Reds while Australia scored 20 points from the Reds

 If India has to go further, it will have to beat Bangladesh because there were only two teams in the form of Korea and Bangladesh, which could give it a fight in the group and one has lost and one is left
 29 june ko rajkumaar hiraani kii film sanju relies ke liye taiyaar he
 The film has been in the news ever since the teaser and trailer were released
 darshak sanjay dutt kii jindagi ke utaar-chadhaav ko dekhne ke liye utsuk hai
 Director Rajkumar Hirani, who decided to make Sanjay Dutt's biopic, shared many things related to the actor's life in a special conversation
 sanjay dutt kii jindagi par byopic banane kii kyon sochi?sanjay dutt kii kahani logon ko pataa he, par jab main unke saath baitha to ek alag hi duniya dikhaai di
 The story of Sanjay Dutt's relationship with his father and relationship with friends was quite interesting
 isliye is par kahani likhane kaa man bana liya
 Sanjay Dutt, who got emotional after remembering his father, said, "when was your first meeting with Sanjay Dutt, not always good relationship? We approached him for the role of Munnabhai's Jimmy Shergill
" kyonki munnabhai ke lead role ke liye ham shahrukh khan kaa naam pehle hi final kar chuke the
 But when Shahrukh approached for the role of Munna, he did not have dates, then we told Sanju that he has to play the main role of Munnabhai
 ye sunakar unhen jaise jhatka laga or wo pareshaan ho gaye kyonki unke paas dats bhi nahin thim
 But after reading the script of the film, Sanjay Dutt said yes to this film
 sunil dutt ke kirdaar ke liye paresh rawal kaa chayan karne kaa faisla kaise liya?sanju ke liye ranbir kii casting to turant ho gayi
 But it took us a long time to play Dutt Saheb
 hamen koi vaisaa nahin mil rahaa tha jo thodaa unki tarah najar aae
 Because he had no style, he was always seen in clean shave and enlarged hair
 kai logon ke saath hamane unke luks ko tri bhi kiya tha lekin baat nahin bani phir to aisa lag rahaa tah kii ham sanjay dutt ko sunil dutt ke kirdaar main cast kar lete hai
 But she would be stupid because Sanjay would stand in front of Sanjay
 phir hamane paresh rawal sahab ko bataaya, unhone hamaare saath reeding kii or aakhirkaar phir hamen sunil dutt sahab mil hi gaye
 Have you ever had a special meeting with Sunil Dutt? i met Dutt Sahab during Munnabhai
 unako jab script bheji thi to unhone urdu main script maangi thi, hamane vahi script bhej di thi
 In the 9 o'clock shift, he used to come at eight and a half, he used to find things like vanity van, monitor
 kaaphi anushaasit insaan the, 6 maheene ke baad dabing ke dauraan wo khud vahi script lekar aae the, jo hamane unhen di thi, jabaki ham log dabing main nai script dete hai
 You also spoke to Aamir Khan about Sunil Dutt's character? Aamir is my friend, i recite all the scripts to him, when i told him the script of Sanju, he said, "I am not in your film
" or aisa hi tab hua tha jab main 3 idiyats kar rahaa tha, tab sanjay dutt ne ye baat kahi thi ki yaar main nahin hum teri film main
 So lets return to Aamir's talk, i jokingly told him that Aamir should play the role of father
 unhone panchagani main mujhe bulaayaa or kaha, 'main abhi dangal main buudhe insaan kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahaa hum, uske baad phir agar vaisaa hi kirdaar karuunga to mujhe yang role nahin milenge
 Then he jokingly said that if you had given me Sanju's role, i would have done that
 aapako nahin laga kii kai logon ko is byopic se etraj ho saktaa he?pehali baat ye he kii kisi ne bhi mujhe byopic ke liye naaraaz hokar approach nahin kiya he
 Secondly, while making a film we also have to be honest
 dhai ghante main kahani banane ke liye aapako kai kirdaaron ko jeena padataa he
 Anyway, we have focused on drugs, gun relationships
 aapaki filmon kii ek khaasiyat he unamem pita-putr or dosti ko bade achche se darshaya jaataa he?haa meri jindagi main bhi mere pita ke saath or doston ke saath rishte ahm rahe hai
 Perhaps the same thing comes on the screen
 jab partishan hua to papa sindh (pakistan) se bharat aae, wo aksar vahaan kii kahaniyaan sunaaya karte the
 One day i would definitely like to visit that area, he used to belong to the city named Nawab Shah, used to go on horses
 mere pita ne ye bataaya ki pehali baar cycle unhone bharat main dekhi thi
 But we have not thought about these stories in the film
 salmaan ne kiya 'sanju' par coment, ranbir kapur ne diya ye javabmunnabhai america kab jaaenge?munnabhai america to nahin jaaenge, lekin munnabhai kaa aglaa part jarur banegaa
 We are just busy scripting this film
 sanju kii relies ke baad us par dhyaan diya jayega
 a new story is being written, the story of America will not be made
 aapaki or abhijaat kii jodi bilkul saleem-javed jais jodi he?nahin aisa kahana galat he, hamaara tallent vaisaa nahin he
 We both just keep going, don't leave
 saleem-javed ke jaisaa kaam ham nahin kar pate
 Are you making another biopic? No, that's not the case at all, it's all a rumor
 madhya pradesh ke damoh jile main ek gaanv main aath saal kii maasoom bacchee ke saath dushkarm kiye jane kaa maamla saamne aayaa he

 DMDK, the main opposition party in the state assembly, suffered a shock as seven members of its own party openly rebelled and voted in favor of the AIADMK, which led to its candidate AR Elangovan losing the election
 abhinayta se netaa bane vijayakaanth kii party anya dalon ke samarthan kii ummid par chunaav main kudi thi lekin use apane baagiyon kii to chodo, kisi kaa bhi samarthan nahin mila

 The official said that the possibility of additional votes in favor of these two could decide a winner but incidentally, all the votes of second preference in favor of AIADMK candidates were in favor of another AIADMK candidate
 udhaaharan ke liye, annadramuk ke ve maitreyan ke atirikt maton main do duusari variyata ke mat shaamil the lekin ye mat unki apni hi party ke arjuna ke liye daale gaye the
 This led to Jamaluddin immediately declaring the vote an 'exhausted paper' as Arjuna had already been declared victorious at the end of the counting of votes

 All his additional votes were cast in favor of one of the AIADMK members and Jamaluddin declared them all as 'exhausted papers'

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Monday pulled Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh for making critical comments on the Indian Home Ministry in the context of China and advised him not to comment on the functioning of other ministries
 manmohan ne ramesh se baat kii or unhen spasht bataaya ki sarkaar main china ke prati apane rukh ko lekar ‘koi bhram nahin’ he jiske saath vah ‘rachanaatmak sambandh’ chaahati he
 Sources in the Prime Minister's Office said that Manmohan told Ramesh "it is advisable for cabinet colleagues not to comment on the functioning of other ministries, especially in the context of important neighbors like China
" ’beijing main ramesh kii tippanee ke do din baad pradhanmantri kaa yah kadaa sandesh aayaa he
 Ramesh had said in the Chinese capital that the Home Ministry is taking a "more defensive than necessary" and "vigilant" approach to Chinese companies entering India
 manmohan ne ramesh se kaha ‘china ke bare main hamaari nitiyon main koi bhram nahin he or ham beijing ke saath lagataar rachanaatmak sambandh chaahate hai
 Ramesh, while speaking about the enthusiasm developed between India and China on climate change at the Copenhagen summit, suggested that the Ministry of Home Affairs (indian) should adopt a 'more liberal' view towards Chinese investment in India
 grih mantralay ne bhi ramesh ko unki tippanee ke liye jhidki lagaai or kaha ki chini companiyon ke saath koi bhedbhaav nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 Home Secretary GK Pillai said, 'it is wrong to say that the security establishment has a discriminatory attitude against the Chinese
 ’ unhone kaha ‘chini companiyaan pehle se hi kaaphi sankhya main bharat main maujuud hai
 She is working in various fields including telecommunications
 main nahin maanata ki sarkaar kii ore se kisi tarah kaa bhedbhaav kiya ja rahaa he
 Ramesh had said on Saturday that security establishments are imposing 'unmet need' restrictions on Chinese investment in India
 unhone yah tippanee haal main ai un khabaron ke sandarbh main kii ki bharat ne suraksha chintaaon ko lekar china kii badi company huavei se doorsanchaar upkarnon ke aayaat par roak laga di he khaskar simavarti kshetron main
 The Congress is also angry at Ramesh's comments
 party ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha ‘grih mantralay jaise samvedansheel mantralay kii niti or karypranali ke khilaaf tippanee karnaa or vah bhi duusare desh kii dharti par ise uchit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 If there are differences of opinion, they should be resolved at the level of the party and the government

 bihar vidhansabha chunaav main daal ek bada mudda ban gai he
 On the one hand, while the Union Minister is blaming the state government for the increased price of pulses, on the other hand the state government is blaming the policies of the Center for this
 mahangaai kii is gend ko donon paksh ek-duusare ke paale main daal rahe hai
 The people of Bihar are upset with the increased price of pulses in the midst of this politics
 is chunaavamein haalanki kendra or rajya sarkaar ek duusare par doshaaropan bhale hi kar rahi hon parantu daal kii badi keemat ne rajg ke netaaon ko baikfoot par to laa hi diya he
 Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh and Food Consumer Minister Ram Vilas Paswan came out on the issue of rising prices of pulses
 daal kii badi keemat ke liye nitish sarkaar par hi dosha madh diya
 Radhamohan Singh said that the Center sent letters to the government at least six times about pulses purchase, but there was no effect on the government
 donon netaaon ne kaha ki sarkaar jaan boojhkar daal kii keemat badhaati gai he, taaki iskaa thikra centre par phoda ja sake
 Paswan said that four letters were written to the state government by the Ministry of Food Supply and Consumer, but no response was received
 rajd adhyaksh lalu prasad ne twit kar kaha tha ki daal itani manhagi ho gai he ki abghar kii murgi daal barabarka muhaavara bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is strongly targeting the central government for making pulses expensive in election meetings
 vah kah rahe hai ki kendra sarkaar har maamle main puri tarah asafal ho gai he
 Why pulses have increased in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh
 is bich patna se prakashit ek hindi samchaar patr ne daal kii badi keemat ko lekar online survey kiya
 It was asked about the impact of this election
 survey main kareeb 60 fisadi logon ne kaha ki mahangaai sidhe janata se judaa maamla he
 Most people consider it a matter of center
 daal ke mudde par is chunaav main bhaajapa ko kaaphi nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Mamta of Patna says that even though the leaders are raising the issue of pulses due to elections today, the reality is that most middle-class families have to bear the brunt of inflation
 ye netaa mahangaai ko kya jaane? manish kehete hai ki yah kis sarkaar kaa vishay he, ye to aam log nahin jaanate hai, lekin thali se daal gaayab ho chuki he
 Pulses are being sold at Rs 200 per kg today

 abhi congress main number 2 ke taur par aadhikarik rup se unki tajposhi hona baaki he, magar rahul gandhi kisi ghoshnaa kaa intjaar nahin kar rahe hai
 Rahul seems ready, or perhaps ready, to lead the party eight years after he first took the stage
 4 november ko dilli main hui congress kii raily main rahul ko sonia gandhi or manmohan singh ke saath pramukh vaktaa ke taur par pesh kiya gaya
 He supported both Manmohan's economic reforms and Sonia's populist schemes like the Food Security Bill
 haalanki 2011 main uttar pradesh ke chunaav prachaar main rahul retail main epadi ke paksh main bol chuke the lekin rashtriya str par sarkaar kii nitiyon ke samarthan main jor-shor se utarane kaa yah unka pehla mauka tha
 Rahul's big role is not limited to the camera
 ek maah se zyada vakt ho gaya, ve prati din apni maa ke saath yaa unke bagaiyr, 10 janpath par party kaaryakartaaon or netaaon se milane main dedh ghanta vyateet karte hai
 He also regularly visits the party's war room at 15 Gurdwara Rakabganj Road
 party ke ek mahasachiv ke mutabik, rahul ne kuch chuninda netaaon ke saath, jinamein sonia ke vafaadaar or team rahul ke log shaamil hai, agle aam chunaavon ke liye ranneeti bananaa shuru kar diya he
 These selected leaders include Sonia's political secretary Ahmed Patel, Union Minister Jairam Ramesh, General Secretary Digvijay Singh, Janardan Dwivedi and Madhusudan Mistry
 yah team rahul ke pehle ke think tanks ke bilkul ulat he
 At that time, his interest was limited only to the youth wing of the party and his talks were also limited to new generation mps like Jitendra Singh, Meenakshi Natarajan, Deepender Hooda and Harish Chaudhary
 ye sabhi yuvak congress kaaryakari samiti ke sadsy hai chand aise party sadsy hi hai jo har pakhwaade rahul gandhi se baatcheet karte hai
 But here he has started focusing on the main party
 aajkal ve sanghathanaatmak pherbadal kii ruparekha banane main vyast bataae jate hai
 Digvijay says, "he has full faith in making the team," but he also claims that he has no details of the new team
 yah kaam sonia or rahul kar rahe hai or yahi kaaran he ki shesh party ko iske bare main kuch bhi pataa nahin he
 Digvijay laughs and says, "the captain chooses the team, not the team chooses the captain
 yah rahulji ko hi tay karnaa he
 "digvijay can joke
" uttar pradesh main phiseddi sabit hone ke baad bhi ve team rahul ke ahm sadsy bane hue hai
 But others are not so sure
 puraane log phikrmand hai ki unhen rahul kii congress main jagah milegi yaa nahin, jabaki mukul vaasanic or ambika soni sareekhe duusari peedi ke netaa padonnati kii ummid paale baithe hai
 Rahul's tendency to give preference to NGO workers more than the leaders has also troubled the bitter Congress leaders
 ek cabinet mantri kehete hai, ‘‘minakshi natarajan, mohan prakaash or madhusudan mistre jaise logon ne apni jhelawala prishthbhumi ke chalate tarakkee pai he
 But Rahul has to understand that what is desirable is not always possible
 ’’ gaiyr-karishmai natarajan ko party kii yuva shakha kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya he
 Meanwhile, it is reported that Mistry can be made the general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh, despite the fact that at present he has failed to stop factionalism in the two states of Kerala and Karnataka
 samaajawaadee se congressi bane mohan prakaash uttar pradesh main rahul kii team kaa hissaa the or ab bhi rahul ke vishwaasapaatr bane hue hai
 Nobody is very clear about Rahul's new role
 19 aktubar ko punjab ke ek daure par rahul ne jalandhar main party kaaryakartaaon se mulaakaat kii
 When those people demanded a change of leadership in the state, they simply said that their job is just to submit a report to party president Sonia Gandhi
 netritv parivartan par faisla ve hi lengi
 Congress General Secretary, B
 of Karnataka ke
 Hariprasad says, "rahul's presence has brought a new generation and a new thought that suits the current generation
" ’’rahul par vipaksh ke hamale ke bare main unka kahana he, ‘‘chunki vipaksh ke paas agali peedi kaa koi yuva netaa nahin he, isiilie ve rahul ko aparipakv kehete hai
 "despite such promising statements, this young leader is still an enigma
" iskaa ek kaaran yah he ki ve party karyaalay kii bajaae 12 tughlaq len sthit apane awaas ke band daravaajon ke peeche kaam karte hai
 When Dalit thinker Chandrabhan Prasad co-authored a paper titled “rethinking Inequality” in 2010 Market Reform Era in Uttar Pradesh, he was invited to meet Rahul at his residence
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘rahul ke paas ek bhavishyalakshi (futuristic) aadhunik agenda he or ve sirf vijyaptiyon par vishwaas nahin karte
 It was Rahul who suggested that the government should make it compulsory to make 4 percent of its purchases from small and medium scale Dalit entrepreneurs
 isse unhen kaam miltaa he
 The Manmohan government made it mandatory in February
 digvijay doharaate hai, ‘‘unhone hameshaa aarthik sudhaaron kaa samarthan kiya he
 Remember, he also supported the nuclear deal
 arthshaastra evam raajnneeti ke muddon par unhen koi bhram nahin he
 They support both reforms and reservations because they want to provide equal opportunities to the underprivileged
 ’’ lekin chunki rahul kabhi-kabhaar hi apane vichaar prakat karte hai, isliye yah baat kuch chuninda logon tak hi simit he
 In fact, from this young leader and his team, the media only gets a frown in response to his questions
"what did we know about Indira Gandhi or Rajiv Gandhi before she became Prime Minister," defended Mani Shankar Iyer Rahul, who was 1985 se 1989 ke bich rajeev gandhi ke pradhanmantri rahete piemo main sanyukt sachiv rahe manishankar ayyar rahul kaa bachaav karte hue kehete hai, ‘‘indira gandhi yaa rajeev gandhi ke pradhanmantri banane se pehle ham unke bare main kya jaanate the? pratham parivaar ke sadsy ke rup main unki sthiti unhen apni raay apane paas hi rakhane ke liye majaboor karti thi
 If Rahul agrees with the government, you will say that he is following the Prime Minister
 yadi ve tanik bhi asahmat honge to isse ek vivaad khadaa ho jayega
 a year after Rajiv Gandhi became Prime Minister, both Iyer and Rajiv went to attend the Golden Jubilee celebrations of their old school, Doon School
 raste main ayyar ne apane purv pradhanadhyaapak jon martin kii patni madi martin kii ek kitaab padhi
 He wrote that when Jawaharlal Nehru came to meet his 11-year-old grandson Rajiv, he was not getting anywhere
 tab unhen yaad aayaa ki ve sharmile hone kii vajah se aksar maile kapade rakhane vaali tokari main chhip jaaya karte the
 When Mani Shankar Aiyar asked Rajiv Gandhi about why he did it, he said that he was not reclusive
 aisa nahin tha ki skool main unke koi vichaar nahin the, bas itnaa ki ve nahin chaahate the ki unke upar apane naanaa jawaharlal nehru ke andhanukaran yaa unke virodh kaa aarope lage
 Now the time has come for Rahul to get out of that basket of dirty clothes
 kyonki yadi ek din unhen manmohan singh kii jagah leni he to desh ko yah jaanane kii jarurat he ki ve kin baton kaa samarthan karte hai
 The Delhi High Court has taken serious cognizance of the increasing dues of civic amenities on mps, leaders and political parties

 edilade test main jab paanchaven din kaa khel shuru hoga to nazren bhartiya ballebaajon par tiki hongi
 By the end of the fourth day of play, Australia has increased its total to 363 runs
 aise main agar, antim din australian captain maaikel clark ne chauthe din ke score paanch wicket par 290 ran par bhi pari samaapt ghoshit kii, to bharat ke saamne 364 ranon kaa lakshya hoga
 How difficult these goals will be in the last day of the match and in the fourth innings, it can be gauged that to date there have not been so many runs to win in the fourth innings on the ground of Adelaide
 edilade main chauthi pari main jeet hasil karne ke liye jo sabase bada score bana he, wo 315 ranon kaa he
 The target was achieved by England against England in 1902, 112 years ago, the Australian team won the Test by scoring 315 runs for six wickets
 iske alaava jis tarah se chauthe din nethan leone kii phiraki ke saamne bharat ke antim paanch wicket gire, use dekhakar ye lagata he ki antim din bhartiya ballebaazon ke liye bada imtihaan sabit hone vaala he
 It can be said that Team India can achieve the target of 364 runs in 90 overs game, because in the third day of this Test, India scored 369 runs for 5 wickets in 90 overs
 itnaa hi nahin, edilade test kii chauthi pari main sabase zyada ran banane kaa record bhi bharat ke naam he
 In 1978, India scored 445 runs in the fourth innings of the Adelaide Test
 team wo muqaabala mahaj 47 ranon se haar gai thi, lekin mohinder amarnath, gundappa vishwanath or dilip vengsarakar kii shandaar ballebaazi kii badaulat team ek samay match jeetne kii surat main pahunch gai thi
 Also, thanks to Mohammad Azharuddin's century in 1991-92, Team India scored 333 runs in the fourth innings in Adelaide
 tab bhartiya team mahaj 38 ran se match haar gai thi
 During 2003-04, Rahul Dravid had shown the miracle of winning the Test for India on his own
 pehali pari main 233 ran or duusari pari main note out 72 ran banaakar dravid ne team india ko chaar wicket se jeet dilaai thi
 Then India won the match by scoring 233 runs
 aise main edilade main agar bhartiya ballebaazon ne sangharsh dikhaaya to team india itihaas bana sakati he, edilade main chauthi pari main sabase zyaada ran banaakar test jeetne kaa itihaas
 But for this, Shikhar Dhawan, Murali Vijay, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane and Rohit Sharma will have to show their full power
 match jis tarah se turn le rahaa he, use dekhte hue ye chunauti behad mushkil dikh rahi he, lekin itihaas to mushkil chunautiyon se paar paakar hi banaae jate hai

 Even before CM Kejriwal's announcement, Delhi businessmen have suddenly lodged their objection to the proposal to increase such wages
 federation of indian chambers and commers of india (fikki) ne ek chitthee likhakar dilli ke shram mantri gopal raay ko aisa nahin karne ke liye aagaah kiya he
 On behalf of this association of businessmen, Secretary General Dr
 A
 Didar Singh has written this letter
 chitthee main is baat kaa zikr he ki 46 fisadi badhotaree kii vajah se dilli main ati laghu or laghu kaarobaar ko bhayankar nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he, kyonki yahi wo sector hai jo dilli main sabase zyaada rojgaar uplabdh karwaata he
 This letter of fixing minimum wages more than the neighboring states also mentions that Delhi has a minimum wage in the neighboring states
 dilli main alag-alag shreniyon main pehle hi punjab kii tulana main mazdooree 30 se lekar 32 fisadi tak zyada he
 Delhi's wages are already 19 to 26 percent higher than Haryana
 uttar pradesh or rajastan main to ye antar or kahin bad jaataa he
 Compared to Uttar Pradesh, different categories of laborers get 32 to 35 per cent more wages in Delhi, while the difference between minimum wages in Rajasthan and Delhi varies from 64 to 84 per cent
 iske baad ab dilli main 46 fisadi badhotaree or prastaavit he
 These differences will increase manifold
 saath hi saath is prastaav ko lagu karana mushkil hoga kyonki naukari dene vaale kya nunatam mazdooree de bhi rahe hai yaa nahin, is par najar rakhana or mushkil hoga
 The scope of corruption will remain
 kya hoga iskaa asar?kaarobaariyon ke sangh kii maane to isse dilli main kaarobaar karne waalon ko ek or bada jhatka lagegaa
 They will be forced to go out after covering their business
 yani kejariwal sahab ke elaan se pehle hi kaarobaariyon ne is prastaav ko laal jhandi dikhaa di thi
 Despite this, not only Kejriwal announced this plan on the occasion of Independence Day, but this week there is also a preparation to pass this proposal to the cabinet
 dilli sarkaar ke sutron kii maane to shram vibhaag ke is prastaav par sarkaar ke hi kai vibhaagon ko aapatti he
 If the proposal is passed in the cabinet, then the proposal may reach the Lt
 Governor and take a break
 in sab baton ko jaanate hue kejariwal ne is prastaav ko laane kaa risk shaayad isliye liya he taaki mazdooron ke bich wo ek sandesh de saken ki wo unki bhalaai ke liye lage hue hai
