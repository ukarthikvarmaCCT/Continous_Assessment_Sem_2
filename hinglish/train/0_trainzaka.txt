 This trick worked
 
 
 islam kis tarah mahilaon sahit sabhi logon ko paidaaishi azaad or ek samaan dekhtaa he, is bare main soad apane vichaar online saajha karti hai
 
 
 Apart from this, ideas also came to his mind in the path of liberalism
 
 
 bas, yahi kaaran rahaa shabdon, or tasveeron kii bhi, jang shuru ho gai
 
 
 After posting pictures of bearded men, top religious leaders and other traditionalists in the country termed Soad al-shaimri as hypocritical, atheist, sly and devilish
 
 
 unka munhfat swabhaav or tivi tok sho main hijaab ke bina unka nazar aana hil main unke parivaar ke liye dikkatein paidaa karne laga
 
 
 According to Soad's younger brother Fayez, a community leader once told him, "you are not a man at all
 
 
 tum apni bahan ko is tarah kaa bartaav karne kii ijazat kaise de sakate ho
 
 
 " fyez ne kaha ki lagbhag saat saal ke liye usne hil chhod diya tha, kyonki taane-ulahne bardaasht ke baahar ho gaye the
 
 
 The relationship that came to her from another clan also broke down only because of her sister's image
 
 
 chote bhai dwaara soad ko uski 'harkaton' ke liye kose jane ke baad uske saath hua fyez kaa jhagada is kadar badha ki aakhirkaar donon bhai aspataal pahunch gaye
 
 
 In the beginning, Faira tells, Yara also opposes Soad
 
 
 skool main bachche bhi soad ke beton ko taane maarthe the, jinke baad ve ghar aakar apni maa par apana gussa nikaalte the
 
 
 On 28 October 2014, Soad al-shaimri was detained and placed in the women's wing of Briman prison in Jeddah
 
 
 us par janabhaawanaaon ko bhadakaane kaa aarope tha
 
 
 But she was never prosecuted, she was never convicted
 
 
 salaakhon ke peeche rahakar bhi soad al-shaimari ne 'vakaalat' band nahin kii, or vah mahilaon ko bataati raheen ki islam main sangeet kii ijazat he
 
 
 Apart from this, she also kept informing women about their legal rights
 
 
 vah bataati hai ki uske baad mahila muslim mishanri pehle ke mukaable jelon main zyaada aane lageen, or vahaan band mahilaon ko bataane lageen ki unka vahaan hona khuda kii marzi he
 
 
 Jail TV always operates on the religious channel Majd
 
 
 hiraasat se unhen 29 janvari, 2015 ko reeha kiya gaya
 
 
 He had to sign a pledge to curtail his social activities, and one of his male relatives, his brother Fayose, was signed on his release documents
 
 
 iske baad bhi vah twitor par apane 207,000 folunron ke liye sandesh likhti rahati hai, lekin unka kahana he ki ab vah pehle ke mukaable zyaada saavdhaanee se apane shabd chunati hai
 
 
 The comments yaara ab apni maa kii gatividhiyon kaa samarthan karti he, haalanki uski khwaahish aaj bhi yahi he ki kaash, uski maa hijaab ke khilaaf bahes na kare, or prabhaavshaalee dharmik netaaon se bahes na kiya kare
 
 
 Yara says, "they give me great courage
 
 
 unhone vah sab jhela he, jo aap nahin jhel sakate
 
 
 " mahilaon ke adhikaron kii baat karne vaali talakshuda 42-varshiya soad al-shaimari ne dadhi rakhane vaale kai purushon kii tasviren post kin, jinamein ek paramparawaadi yahudee, ek hippie, ek communist, ek turki khaliph, ek sikh tathaa ek muslim tha
 
 
 Soad al-shaymari wrote with these pictures that just by keeping a beard does not make a person holy or Muslim
 
 
 usne is ore bhi dhyaan dilaayaa ki paigambar mohammad ke samay main islam ke sabase kattar aalochakon main se ek kii dadhi paigambar se bhi lambii thi
 
 
 Making such outlandish remarks is not new to Soad al-shaymari, the mother of six children who graduated in Islamic law
 
 
 ek bade kabeeley ke dharmaparayan parivaar main janmi soad bachapan main bhale hi bheden charaati raheen, lekin ab vah mahila adhikaron kii maang karne vaali udaaravaadi kaaryakarta hai, or aksar islam ko lekar die apane tarkon se saudi arab kii shaktishaalee dharmik satta ko chunauti detii rahati hai
 
 
 Soad of his ideas has to pay a price as well
 
 
 vah 'janabhaawanaaon ko bhadakaane ke liye' bina kisi aupchaarik aarope ke teen maheene jail main bitaa chuki hai
 
 
 The government has banned their foreign visits
 
 
 unke online forum 'free saudi librals network' ke sah-sansthaapak or blogar rafe badavi 10 saal kaid kii sazaa kaat rahe hai, or unhen saarvajanik rup se 50 kode bhi lagaae gaye the
 
 
 Soad's father has publicly refused to accept her daughter
 
 
 lekin itnaa sab bhi soad al-shaimari kii awaz ko dabaane ke liye kaaphi nahin tha
 
 
 Soad al-shaymari says, "I have some rights, which i think are not against my religion
 
 
 main un adhikaron ko maangana chaahati hum, or chaahati hum ki jo log faisle karte hai, ve meri baat sunen or phir kuch karen
 
 
 " arab deshon main mahila islamic scollar or kaaryakarta khuda ke saamne purushon or mahilaon ko ek samaan darja dene vaale sharia kanoonon kii nae sire se vyakhya karne kii lambey arase se maang karti aa rahi hai
 
 
 Soad al-shamari is considered to be one of the most vocal and active religious and women's rights advocates in Saudi Arabia
 
 
 soad ke mitra tathaa saathi kaaryakarta sahar nasif kaa kahana he, "unhen (soad al-shaimari ko) apni kahi baat par puraa bharosa hota he, or vah katai hichakati nahin hai
 
 
 He comes from an Arab background, a desert environment
 
 
 unhen apni prishthbhumi par fakhr he, lekin isi prishthbhumi kii vajah se vah sabhi ke saath kuch rukhi ho jaati hai, or apane vichaar vyakt karte hue bahut rukhi
 
 
 " hil praant main ek kisaan ke 12 bacchon main se sabase badi santan ke rup main pali-badi soad al-shaimari bhedon kaa dhyaan rakhti thim
 
 
 She was not only religious, but lived as a 'salafi' (a Muslim who accepts and accepts literal interpretations of Islamic laws as they are)
 
 
 uniwarsity of hil se islamic kanoon main snaatak kii degree lene ke baad soad al-shaimari public skool teacher ban gayi
 
 
 At the age of 17, Soad married a man twice as old as his own clan, and then had a daughter - Yara
 
 
 20 saal kii umr main soad kaa talaak ho gaya, or unhone phir shaadi kar lee
 
 
 Soad's second marriage to the same chief judge of Haile, who had seen his divorce case
 
 
 iske baad adhikaron ke liye soad al-shaimari kii jang us din shuru hui, jis din unki beti ko unase chin liya gaya
 
 
 As Yara turned seven, her custody was handed over to Soad's first husband
 
 
 chunki soad duusari shaadi kar chuki thim, so, adaalat ne faisla diya ki kisi duusare purush ke saath rahane kii jagah bacchee ko uske pita ke saath rahanaa chahie
 
 
 Soad al-shaymari says, "when they took him (yara) from me, and said, 'this is the will of Allah' and 'this is Islam', right then the spark of rebellion ignited in me
 
 
 aisa ho hi nahin saktaa ki duniya main aisa koi khuda he, jo is ninsaphi or takalif ko sirf isliye bardaasht kar legaa, kyonki main ek aurat hum
 
 
 " vah apni beti ko dekh bhi nahin sakati thi, so, aath saal tak vah apane mata-pita, apane samudaay ke alaava apane va apni beti yaara ke bich aane vaale har shaks se ladati rahi
 
 
 Talking handsomely with a proud face, Soad al-shaimri says, "I was getting mad, but in front of my parents, in front of my judge husband, and in front of the people in our community around them, Because of my name and my place in the community, i was expected to sit quietly watching everything
 
 
 " Soad al-shaymari had five children from his second marriage, but he was divorced soon thereafter
 
 
 jab yaara ke pita biimaar ho gaye, or uski daadi guzar gayi, tab 16 saal kii ho chuki yaara ke pita ne aakhirkaar use uski maa ke saath rahane kii ijazat de di, or soad al-shaimari apane sabhi chah bacchon ke saath zyaada udaar kahe jane vaale shahar jedda aa bases
 
 
 Soad used his knowledge of Sharia law as a legal adviser to women in need
 
 
 kabhi-kabhi unki di salahen dharmanishth kam hoti thim, kapat or nirlajjataa se bhari zyaada
 
 
 Once, he advised a friend to find out which judge is looking into his case, then put on some make-up, and cry in front of the judge to urge him to pursue the date
 
 
 yah tarkeeb kaam kar gai
 
 
 Soad shares her thoughts online about how Islam views all people, including women, as free and equal
 
 
 iske alaava udaarvaad kii raah main unke dimag main aae idia bhi
 
 
 That is the reason, the words, and the pictures too, the battle started
 
 
 dadhi vaale purushon kii tasviren post karne ke baad desh main based sheersh dharmaguruon or anya paramparawaadiyon ne soad al-shaimari ko paakhandee, naastik, dhoort or shaitani qaraar diya
 
 
 His blunt nature and his appearance without a hijab on TV talk shows started to cause problems for his family in Haile
 
 
 soad ke chote bhai fyez ke mutabik, samudaay ke ek netaa ne ek baar use kaha tha, "tum to mard hi nahin ho
 
 
 How can you allow your sister to behave like this? 
 
 " Fyz said that he had left Haile for about seven years, because the taunts had been out of tolerance
 
 
 ek or kabeeley se uske liye aayaa rishta bhi sirf uski bahan kii chhavi kii vajah se tut gaya
 
 
 After the younger brother cooped up Soad for his 'antics', the feud with him escalated to such an extent that the two brothers finally reached the hospital
 
 
 fyez bataata he, shuruyaat main to yaara ne bhi soad kaa virodh kiya
 
 
 The children in school also used to taunt Soad's sons, after which they used to come home and vent their anger on their mother
 
 
 28 oktober, 2014 ko soad al-shaimari ko hiraasat main lekar jedda kii briman jail ke mahila wing main rakhaa gaya
 
 
 He was accused of inciting public sentiments
 
 
 lekin us par kabhi mukadmaa nahin chalaaya gaya, vah kabhi doshi qaraar nahin di gai
 
 
 Even behind bars, Soad al-shamri did not stop 'advocacy', and she continued to tell women that music was allowed in Islam
 
 
 iske alaava vah mahilaon ko unke kanoonee adhikaron ke bare main bhi bataati raheen
 
 
 She says that after that women Muslim missionaries started coming to the jails more than before, and told the women who were there that they wanted to be there
 
 
 jail main laga tivi hameshaa dharmik channel 'majd' (majd) par hi chalata rahata he
 
 
 He was released from custody on January 29, 2015
 
 
 unhen apane saamaajik gatividhiyon ko kam karne ke vachan par dastakhat karne pade, or unke ek purush sambandhi, unke bhai fyoz se unki rihaai ke kaagazat par dastakhat karwaae gaye
 
 
 Even after that, she keeps writing messages for her 207,000 followers on Twitter, but says she now chooses her words more carefully than before
 
 
 tippaniyan Yara now supports her mother's activities, although she still wishes that her mother should not argue against the hijab, and argue against influential religious leaders
 
 
 yaara kahati he, "unase mujhe bahut himmat milti he

 At the age of 17, Soad married a man twice as old as his own clan, and then had a daughter - Yara
 
 
 20 saal kii umr main soad kaa talaak ho gaya, or unhone phir shaadi kar lee
 
 
 Soad's second marriage to the same chief judge of Haile, who had seen his divorce case
 
 
 iske baad adhikaron ke liye soad al-shaimari kii jang us din shuru hui, jis din unki beti ko unase chin liya gaya
 
 
 As Yara turned seven, her custody was handed over to Soad's first husband
 
 
 chunki soad duusari shaadi kar chuki thim, so, adaalat ne faisla diya ki kisi duusare purush ke saath rahane kii jagah bacchee ko uske pita ke saath rahanaa chahie
 
 
 Soad al-shaymari says, "when they took him (yara) from me, and said, 'this is the will of Allah' and 'this is Islam', right then the spark of rebellion ignited in me

 Talking handsomely with a proud face, Soad al-shaimri says, "I was getting mad, but in front of my parents, in front of my judge husband, and in front of the people in our community around them, Because of my name and my place in the community, i was expected to sit quietly watching everything
 
 
 " Soad al-shaymari had five children from his second marriage, but he was divorced soon thereafter

 Once, he advised a friend to find out which judge is looking into his case, then put on some make-up, and cry in front of the judge to urge him to pursue the date

 His blunt nature and his appearance without a hijab on TV talk shows started to cause problems for his family in Haile
 
 
 soad ke chote bhai fyez ke mutabik, samudaay ke ek netaa ne ek baar use kaha tha, "tum to mard hi nahin ho
 
 
 How can you allow your sister to behave like this? 
 
 " Fyz said that he had left Haile for about seven years, because the taunts had been out of tolerance
 
 
 ek or kabeeley se uske liye aayaa rishta bhi sirf uski bahan kii chhavi kii vajah se tut gaya

 28 oktober, 2014 ko soad al-shaimari ko hiraasat main lekar jedda kii briman jail ke mahila wing main rakhaa gaya
 
 
 He was accused of inciting public sentiments
 
 
 lekin us par kabhi mukadmaa nahin chalaaya gaya, vah kabhi doshi qaraar nahin di gai
 
 
 Even behind bars, Soad al-shamri did not stop 'advocacy', and she continued to tell women that music was allowed in Islam
 
 
 iske alaava vah mahilaon ko unke kanoonee adhikaron ke bare main bhi bataati raheen
 
 
 She says that after that women Muslim missionaries started coming to the jails more than before, and told the women who were there that they wanted to be there

 Even after that, she keeps writing messages for her 207,000 followers on Twitter, but says she now chooses her words more carefully than before
 
 
 tippaniyan Yara now supports her mother's activities, although she still wishes that her mother should not argue against the hijab, and argue against influential religious leaders

 At the age of 17, Soad married a man twice as old as his own clan, and then had a daughter - Yara
 
 
 20 saal kii umr main soad kaa talaak ho gaya, or unhone phir shaadi kar lee
 
 
 Soad's second marriage to the same chief judge of Haile, who had seen his divorce case
 
 
 iske baad adhikaron ke liye soad al-shaimari kii jang us din shuru hui, jis din unki beti ko unase chin liya gaya
 
 
 As Yara turned seven, her custody was handed over to Soad's first husband
 
 
 chunki soad duusari shaadi kar chuki thim, so, adaalat ne faisla diya ki kisi duusare purush ke saath rahane kii jagah bacchee ko uske pita ke saath rahanaa chahie
 
 
 Soad al-shaymari says, "when they took him (yara) from me, and said, 'this is the will of Allah' and 'this is Islam', right then the spark of rebellion ignited in me
 
 
 aisa ho hi nahin saktaa ki duniya main aisa koi khuda he, jo is ninsaphi or takalif ko sirf isliye bardaasht kar legaa, kyonki main ek aurat hum
 
 
 " vah apni beti ko dekh bhi nahin sakati thi, so, aath saal tak vah apane mata-pita, apane samudaay ke alaava apane va apni beti yaara ke bich aane vaale har shaks se ladati rahi
 
 
 Talking handsomely with a proud face, Soad al-shaimri says, "I was getting mad, but in front of my parents, in front of my judge husband, and in front of the people in our community around them, Because of my name and my place in the community, i was expected to sit quietly watching everything
 
 
 " Soad al-shaymari had five children from his second marriage, but he was divorced soon thereafter
 
 
 jab yaara ke pita biimaar ho gaye, or uski daadi guzar gayi, tab 16 saal kii ho chuki yaara ke pita ne aakhirkaar use uski maa ke saath rahane kii ijazat de di, or soad al-shaimari apane sabhi chah bacchon ke saath zyaada udaar kahe jane vaale shahar jedda aa bases
 
 
 Soad used his knowledge of Sharia law as a legal adviser to women in need
 
 
 kabhi-kabhi unki di salahen dharmanishth kam hoti thim, kapat or nirlajjataa se bhari zyaada
 
 
 Once, he advised a friend to find out which judge is looking into his case, then put on some make-up, and cry in front of the judge to urge him to pursue the date
 
 
 yah tarkeeb kaam kar gai
 
 
 Soad shares her thoughts online about how Islam views all people, including women, as free and equal
 
 
 iske alaava udaarvaad kii raah main unke dimag main aae idia bhi
 
 
 That is the reason, the words, and the pictures too, the battle started
 
 
 dadhi vaale purushon kii tasviren post karne ke baad desh main based sheersh dharmaguruon or anya paramparawaadiyon ne soad al-shaimari ko paakhandee, naastik, dhoort or shaitani qaraar diya
 
 
 His blunt nature and his appearance without a hijab on TV talk shows started to cause problems for his family in Haile
 
 
 soad ke chote bhai fyez ke mutabik, samudaay ke ek netaa ne ek baar use kaha tha, "tum to mard hi nahin ho
 
 
 How can you allow your sister to behave like this? 
 
 " Fyz said that he had left Haile for about seven years, because the taunts had been out of tolerance
 
 
 ek or kabeeley se uske liye aayaa rishta bhi sirf uski bahan kii chhavi kii vajah se tut gaya
 
 
 After the younger brother cooped up Soad for his 'antics', the feud with him escalated to such an extent that the two brothers finally reached the hospital
 
 
 fyez bataata he, shuruyaat main to yaara ne bhi soad kaa virodh kiya
 
 
 The children in school also used to taunt Soad's sons, after which they used to come home and vent their anger on their mother
 
 
 28 oktober, 2014 ko soad al-shaimari ko hiraasat main lekar jedda kii briman jail ke mahila wing main rakhaa gaya
 
 
 He was accused of inciting public sentiments
 
 
 lekin us par kabhi mukadmaa nahin chalaaya gaya, vah kabhi doshi qaraar nahin di gai
 
 
 Even behind bars, Soad al-shamri did not stop 'advocacy', and she continued to tell women that music was allowed in Islam
 
 
 iske alaava vah mahilaon ko unke kanoonee adhikaron ke bare main bhi bataati raheen
 
 
 She says that after that women Muslim missionaries started coming to the jails more than before, and told the women who were there that they wanted to be there
 
 
 jail main laga tivi hameshaa dharmik channel 'majd' (majd) par hi chalata rahata he
 
 
 He was released from custody on January 29, 2015
 
 
 unhen apane saamaajik gatividhiyon ko kam karne ke vachan par dastakhat karne pade, or unke ek purush sambandhi, unke bhai fyoz se unki rihaai ke kaagazat par dastakhat karwaae gaye
 
 
 Even after that, she keeps writing messages for her 207,000 followers on Twitter, but says she now chooses her words more carefully than before
 
 
 tippaniyan Yara now supports her mother's activities, although she still wishes that her mother should not argue against the hijab, and argue against influential religious leaders
 
 
 yaara kahati he, "unase mujhe bahut himmat milti he
 
 
 They have suffered all that you cannot afford
 
 
 " Soad al-shamari became a public school teacher after earning a bachelor's degree in Islamic law from the University of Haile
 
 
 17 saal kii umr main soad ne apane hi kabeeley ke apane se doguni umr ke purush se shaadi kii thi, or phir ek beti - yaara - bhi hui
 
 
 Soad got divorced at the age of 20, and they remarried
 
 
 soad kii duusari shaadi hil ke usee chif jaj se hui, jisane unke talaak ke maamle ko dekha tha
 
 
 After this, the war of rights for Soad al-shamri began on the day his daughter was snatched from him
 
 
 jaise hi yaara saat baras kii hui, soad ke pehle pati ko uski castady saunp di gai
 
 
 Since Soad had remarried, the court ruled that the girl should stay with her father instead of living with another man
 
 
 soad al-shaimari kahati hai, "jab unhone use (yaara ko) mujhase liya, or kaha 'yahi allaah kii marzi he' or 'yahi islam he', thik usee vakt mere andar vidroh kii chingaari sulag uthi
 
 
 It is not possible that there is such a God in the world, who will tolerate this injustice and suffering just because i am a woman
 
 
 " She could not even see her daughter, so for eight years she fought with her parents, her community and everyone who came between her and her daughter Yara
 
 
 bhavaheen chehre ke saath haath baandhe baat karti hui soad al-shaimari kahati hai, "main pagal-si ho rahi thi, lekin apane mata-pita ke saamne, apane jaj pati ke saamne, or unke aasapaas maujuud hamaare samudaay ke logon ke saamne, mere naam or samudaay main meri jagah kii vajah se mujhase ummid kii jaati thi ki main chupchaap baithi sab kuch dekhati rahun
 
 
 " duusari shaadi se soad al-shaimari ko paanch santaanen huin, lekin uske baad jald hi uskaa phir talaak ho gaya
 
 
 When Yara's father became ill, and his grandmother passed away, Yara's father, who was 16 years old, finally allowed him to live with his mother, and Soad al-shaimri was more lenient with all six of his children
 The visiting cities settled in Jeddah
 
 
 sharia kanoon kii apni jaankaree ko soad ne zaruuratmand auraton kii kanoonee salaahkaar (legal adwiser) ke rup main istemaal kiya
 
 
 Sometimes his advice was less pious, more full of treachery and shamelessness
 
 
 ek baar unhone apni ek mitra ko salaah di ki vah pataa kare ki uske cese ko koun-sa jaj dekh rahaa he, phir kuch mechap kare, or jaj ke saamne ro-rokar taarikh aage badhaane kaa aagrah kare
 
 
 This trick worked
 
 
 islam kis tarah mahilaon sahit sabhi logon ko paidaaishi azaad or ek samaan dekhtaa he, is bare main soad apane vichaar online saajha karti hai
 
 
 Apart from this, ideas also came to his mind in the path of liberalism
 
 
 bas, yahi kaaran rahaa shabdon, or tasveeron kii bhi, jang shuru ho gai
 
 
 After posting pictures of bearded men, top religious leaders and other traditionalists in the country termed Soad al-shaimri as hypocritical, atheist, sly and devilish
 
 
 unka munhfat swabhaav or tivi tok sho main hijaab ke bina unka nazar aana hil main unke parivaar ke liye dikkatein paidaa karne laga
 
 
 According to Soad's younger brother Fayez, a community leader once told him, "you are not a man at all
 
 
 tum apni bahan ko is tarah kaa bartaav karne kii ijazat kaise de sakate ho
 
 
 " fyez ne kaha ki lagbhag saat saal ke liye usne hil chhod diya tha, kyonki taane-ulahne bardaasht ke baahar ho gaye the
 
 
 The relationship that came to her from another clan also broke down only because of her sister's image
 
 
 chote bhai dwaara soad ko uski 'harkaton' ke liye kose jane ke baad uske saath hua fyez kaa jhagada is kadar badha ki aakhirkaar donon bhai aspataal pahunch gaye
 
 
 In the beginning, Faira tells, Yara also opposes Soad
 
 
 skool main bachche bhi soad ke beton ko taane maarthe the, jinke baad ve ghar aakar apni maa par apana gussa nikaalte the
 
 
 On 28 October 2014, Soad al-shaimri was detained and placed in the women's wing of Briman prison in Jeddah
 
 
 us par janabhaawanaaon ko bhadakaane kaa aarope tha
 
 
 But she was never prosecuted, she was never convicted
 
 
 salaakhon ke peeche rahakar bhi soad al-shaimari ne 'vakaalat' band nahin kii, or vah mahilaon ko bataati raheen ki islam main sangeet kii ijazat he
 
 
 Apart from this, she also kept informing women about their legal rights
 
 
 vah bataati hai ki uske baad mahila muslim mishanri pehle ke mukaable jelon main zyaada aane lageen, or vahaan band mahilaon ko bataane lageen ki unka vahaan hona khuda kii marzi he
 
 
 Jail TV always operates on the religious channel Majd
 
 
 hiraasat se unhen 29 janvari, 2015 ko reeha kiya gaya
 
 
 He had to sign a pledge to curtail his social activities, and one of his male relatives, his brother Fayose, was signed on his release documents
 
 
 iske baad bhi vah twitor par apane 207,000 folunron ke liye sandesh likhti rahati hai, lekin unka kahana he ki ab vah pehle ke mukaable zyaada saavdhaanee se apane shabd chunati hai
 
 
 The comments yaara ab apni maa kii gatividhiyon kaa samarthan karti he, haalanki uski khwaahish aaj bhi yahi he ki kaash, uski maa hijaab ke khilaaf bahes na kare, or prabhaavshaalee dharmik netaaon se bahes na kiya kare
 
 
 Yara says, "they give me great courage

 tum apni bahan ko is tarah kaa bartaav karne kii ijazat kaise de sakate ho
 
 
 " fyez ne kaha ki lagbhag saat saal ke liye usne hil chhod diya tha, kyonki taane-ulahne bardaasht ke baahar ho gaye the
 
 
 The relationship that came to her from another clan also broke down only because of her sister's image
 
 
 chote bhai dwaara soad ko uski 'harkaton' ke liye kose jane ke baad uske saath hua fyez kaa jhagada is kadar badha ki aakhirkaar donon bhai aspataal pahunch gaye
 
 
 In the beginning, Faira tells, Yara also opposes Soad
 
 
 skool main bachche bhi soad ke beton ko taane maarthe the, jinke baad ve ghar aakar apni maa par apana gussa nikaalte the
 
 
 On 28 October 2014, Soad al-shaimri was detained and placed in the women's wing of Briman prison in Jeddah
 
 
 us par janabhaawanaaon ko bhadakaane kaa aarope tha
 
 
 But she was never prosecuted, she was never convicted
 
 
 salaakhon ke peeche rahakar bhi soad al-shaimari ne 'vakaalat' band nahin kii, or vah mahilaon ko bataati raheen ki islam main sangeet kii ijazat he
 
 
 Apart from this, she also kept informing women about their legal rights
 
 
 vah bataati hai ki uske baad mahila muslim mishanri pehle ke mukaable jelon main zyaada aane lageen, or vahaan band mahilaon ko bataane lageen ki unka vahaan hona khuda kii marzi he
 
 
 Jail TV always operates on the religious channel Majd
 
 
 hiraasat se unhen 29 janvari, 2015 ko reeha kiya gaya
 
 
 He had to sign a pledge to curtail his social activities, and one of his male relatives, his brother Fayose, was signed on his release documents
 
 
 iske baad bhi vah twitor par apane 207,000 folunron ke liye sandesh likhti rahati hai, lekin unka kahana he ki ab vah pehle ke mukaable zyaada saavdhaanee se apane shabd chunati hai
 
 
 The comments yaara ab apni maa kii gatividhiyon kaa samarthan karti he, haalanki uski khwaahish aaj bhi yahi he ki kaash, uski maa hijaab ke khilaaf bahes na kare, or prabhaavshaalee dharmik netaaon se bahes na kiya kare
 
 
 Yara says, "they give me great courage
 
 
 unhone vah sab jhela he, jo aap nahin jhel sakate
 
 
 " duusari shaadi se soad al-shaimari ko paanch santaanen huin, lekin uske baad jald hi uskaa phir talaak ho gaya
 
 
 When Yara's father became ill, and his grandmother passed away, Yara's father, who was 16 years old, finally allowed him to live with his mother, and Soad al-shaimri was more lenient with all six of his children
 The visiting cities settled in Jeddah
 
 
 sharia kanoon kii apni jaankaree ko soad ne zaruuratmand auraton kii kanoonee salaahkaar (legal adwiser) ke rup main istemaal kiya
 
 
 Sometimes his advice was less pious, more full of treachery and shamelessness
 
 
 ek baar unhone apni ek mitra ko salaah di ki vah pataa kare ki uske cese ko koun-sa jaj dekh rahaa he, phir kuch mechap kare, or jaj ke saamne ro-rokar taarikh aage badhaane kaa aagrah kare
 
 
 This trick worked
 
 
 islam kis tarah mahilaon sahit sabhi logon ko paidaaishi azaad or ek samaan dekhtaa he, is bare main soad apane vichaar online saajha karti hai
 
 
 Apart from this, ideas also came to his mind in the path of liberalism
 
 
 bas, yahi kaaran rahaa shabdon, or tasveeron kii bhi, jang shuru ho gai
 
 
 After posting pictures of bearded men, top religious leaders and other traditionalists in the country termed Soad al-shaimri as hypocritical, atheist, sly and devilish
 
 
 unka munhfat swabhaav or tivi tok sho main hijaab ke bina unka nazar aana hil main unke parivaar ke liye dikkatein paidaa karne laga

 Soad used his knowledge of Sharia law as a legal adviser to women in need
 
 
 kabhi-kabhi unki di salahen dharmanishth kam hoti thim, kapat or nirlajjataa se bhari zyaada
 
 
 Once, he advised a friend to find out which judge is looking into his case, then put on some make-up, and cry in front of the judge to urge him to pursue the date
 
 
 yah tarkeeb kaam kar gai
 
 
 Soad shares her thoughts online about how Islam views all people, including women, as free and equal

 That is the reason, the words, and the pictures too, the battle started

 His blunt nature and his appearance without a hijab on TV talk shows started to cause problems for his family in Haile

 ek or kabeeley se uske liye aayaa rishta bhi sirf uski bahan kii chhavi kii vajah se tut gaya
 
 
 After the younger brother cooped up Soad for his 'antics', the feud with him escalated to such an extent that the two brothers finally reached the hospital
 
 
 fyez bataata he, shuruyaat main to yaara ne bhi soad kaa virodh kiya
 
 
 The children in school also used to taunt Soad's sons, after which they used to come home and vent their anger on their mother

 He was accused of inciting public sentiments

 film kaa naam: mirziadiarector: rakesh omprakash mehrastar cast: harshavardhan kapur, saiyame kher , ke ke raina, om purivadhi: 2 ghanta 9 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga: 1
 Rakesh Omprakash Mehra, a director who made super hits such as 5 Star 'rang De Basanti' and 'bhaag Milkha Bhaag' as well as 'delhi 6' and 'aks', finally brought back the story of Mirza Sahiban, which has been running for years
 It is an attempt to present itself on the screen
 aaie jaanate hai kisi he ye film
 
 
 Story: The story of the film draws attention to the love of Mirza (harshvardhan Kapoor) and Sahiban (syami Kher) and the difficulties that follow
 isiike saath ek or kahani chal rahi he munish (harshavardhan kapur) or suchithra (saiyame kher) kii
 There is similarity between the two stories but the results of the two are different
 jahaan puraani kahani main sahiban khud mirza ke tir tod detii he vahiin, aaj kii kahani main kuch alag hota he
 And the reason behind breaking the arrow is also revealed, to know that you will have to watch the film
 5 points main jaane ki ye film kyon dekh sakate hai:1
 The shooting, locations and filming of the film is amazing, the cinematography is excellent and very good scenes are seen in front of it
 2
 If you do not know about the story of Mirza Sahiban, then you can guess it from this film
 3
 The lyrics composed by Gulzar and the music of Shankar Ehsaan Loy on it, as well as the voices of the different singers, have a good confluence that appears in the film
 4
 The film features some sequences such as horse riding and archery in a very precise way
 5
 Despite being the first film, both actors Harshvardhan Kapoor and Symy Kher do not think that this is their debut film
 donon ne bakhubi abhinay kiya he yaa kah sakate hai rakesh omprakash mehara ne karavaaya he
 Weak Link: The film's weak link is its story
 'rang de basanti' main rakesh ne do kahaniyon ko ek hi samay par dikhaaya tha jo ki ekadam sateek baithi thi
 But this time it does not appear in the filming
 vijual treet to he lekin kahani ek vakt ke baad bor karne lagati he
 The screenplay could have been better
 film ke mizaaj ke hisaab se ek khaas tarah kii audiens hi ise pasand kar paaegi
 Rakesh Mehra is once again seen wandering from the direction

 sadan main apni maang rakhte hue naresh agarwal ne kaha ki saansadon kii selary apane secretary se bhi kam hoti he
 In the House, Naresh Aggarwal said that a committee was formed under the chairmanship of Yogi Aditya Nath, which recommended increase in salary of mps, that too was not implemented
 desh ke jajon kii selary badhaai ja rahi he, par saansadon kii selary nahin badhaai ja rahi he
 Let me tell you that right now about 1 month every month to the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha members 40 lakh rupye milte hai
 There are many types of allowances involved
 jaise apane sansadeey kshetra main jane par, offis steshnari or rojaanaa ke bhatte shaamil hai
 Whereas the Parliamentary Committee constituted to increase the salary of mps had said that the salary of mps should be increased according to the rising inflation
 1
 40 lakh to 2
 80 lakh rupye har maheene karne kii sifarish bhi hui he
 To implement the same, he raised his demand in the House on Friday
 jaankaree ke mutabik saansadon kii selary alounsak ko aakhri baar 2010 main rivyuu kiya gaya tha
 In 2010, 300 percent of salary and allowances were increased
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik 1954 se ab tak 35 barsaansdon kiselary ko rivyuu kiya ja chukaa he
 Between 1954 and 2000, basic salary increased by 167 percent, while between 2000 and 2010, it has been increased by 1150 percent
 desh ke mananeeyon kaa dard ye he ki unki selary cabinet secretary se kaaphi kam he
 Naresh Aggarwal also has the same pain that the salary of the cabinet secretary, ie the salary of the country's largest bureaucrat, is more than the honorable mps

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is preparing to board the Chennai Express and has got the support of South's superstar Kamal Haasan
 lekin, dilli bijepi ko camel hasan or kejariwal kii dosti raas nahin aa rahi he
 Especially Kamal Haasan's call for Kejriwal to be a warrior against corruption, BJP leaders in Delhi went on a rampage, after that now BJP has started a shameful campaign for Kejriwal in Delhi
 haalanki camel hasan ko lekar ab bhi bijepi kuch naram najar aa rahi he, lekin kejariwal par lage aaropon kaa pulinda kholane main ab unke virdohi netaa jute gaye hai
 BJP National Minister RP Singh said that the distance between Delhi and Chennai is very much, perhaps that is why it took time for the news of Delhi to reach Chennai
 kyonki agar aisa na hua hota, to kejariwal ke karnaamon se camel hasan bhi waakif hote
 RP Singh said that Kikmal Hassan is a gentleman and in the guise of friendship of Kejriwal, he made such a statement, because the anti-corruption Crusader's Chola has descended on top of Kejriwal
 aar pi singh ke mutabik unhone camel hasan ke bayaan ke turant baad unhen kejariwal ke kuch karnaamon kii jaankaree twitor ke jariye de di he, jisamen unke or unke vidhayakon ke khilaaf chal rahe maamalon se lekar unke kareebi rishtedaaron ke bhrashtachar main lipt hone kii jaankariyaan shaamil hai
 Along with this, he has also informed about the ongoing corruption cases on his ministers to Kamal Haasan
 ab kejariwal ke tamaam duusare karnaamon ko lekar puraa kaccha chiththa bhi wo taiyaar kar rahe hai, jisase camel hasan ko bataaya ja sake ki jis vyakti ko wo bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai ladanevaala bataa rahe hai, uski asaliyat kya he
 It is worth mentioning that Delhi KCM Arvind Kejriwal had gone to Chennai to meet Kamal Haasan and while Kamal Haasan had given a statement about Kejriwal
 kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki kejariwal camel hasan ke jariye tamilnadu kii raajnneeti main apni jameen talash rahe hai
 However, after this meeting, Kejriwal named it an idea exchange and said that there was a positive discussion between them about Tamil Nadu

 On the court's order, the search operation has started at Ram Rahim's Dera Sacha Sauda headquarters in Sirsa in Haryana
 hai court ke purv jaj eke pavaar kai bade adhikariyon ke saath ashram pahunch hai or search jari he
 During this, videography of the entire action is also being done
 lekin isse pehle hi deraa ne jameen ke neeche kankal hone kii baat sweekaar kar lee he
 20 JCB machines have been called for excavation
 dere main dabi hai lashendere main markar dabaa die gaye logon kii asthiyaan milane kii ashanka ke bich deraa ke akhbaar 'sach kahuun' ne is par safai pesh karne kii koshish kii he
 However, in this effort, the newspaper has accepted that dead bodies are buried in Kidre
 kaha jaataa he ki gurmeet ram rahim ke khilaaf bolne waalon ko markar unke shavon ko deraa sachcha sauda parisar ke andar hi jameen main dafna diya jaataa tha
 The Haryana Police has started digging inside the camp with around 20 JCB machines
 police dere ke andar sandigdh jagahon kii khudaai karwaakar in aaropon kii sachai kaa pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahi he
 For this reason, the newspaper of Dera Sacha Sauda has clarified that bones and bones buried during excavation in the Dera complex can be found, because Gurmeet Ram Rahim used to stop his followers from shedting the bones in the rivers and said that the immersion of the bones Doing so spreads pollution and causes dirt in the rivers

 No such place was set in the Dera campus nor was any board installed
 23 april ko hone vaale tisare charan ke chunaav main upi kii das siton main se ek seat mainpuri kii hogi
 Mainpuri seat is the stronghold of SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav
 paanchavin baar wo yahaan se maidan main utre hai
 From the point of view of fighting, only BJP is in the name of the opposition, the remaining eight small local parties and 12 candidates in Mainpuri, including independents, are trying their luck
 mahagathbandhan kii raibareli or amethi main riyaayat ke evaj main congress ne mulaayam ke khilaaf ummidavaar khadaa nahin kiya he
 The truth is that the history of this seat is known as the strongest seat of the Samajwadi Party
 ek peedi jawan ho gai or pichley 24 saal se yahaan samaajawaadee party ke alaava kisi or ko jeet naseeb nahin hui
 Despite 'modi's wind' in 2014, BJP candidate Shatrughan Singh Chauhan not only lost, but the margin of his defeat was 3 lakh 64 thousand votes
 bispi ek lakh 42 hajaar voton ke saath tisare number par thi
 Mulayam had won two seats in 2014 (azamgarh and Mainpuri)
 baad main unhone mainpuri seat apane pote tej pratap ke liye chhod die the
 In the by-election, once again as SP candidate Tej Pratap Singh Yadav defeated BJP candidate Prem Singh Shakya by 3 lakh 21 thousand votes
 haalanki is upachunaav main bijepi ke vot main nau fisadi kii badhotaree hui thi jabaki sapa ke vot main paanch fisadi kii
 bjp's Prem Singh Shakya will once again face Mulayam Singh Yadav in 2019 in a one-sided battle of Mainpuri
 agar 2014 ke parinaamon ko aadhaar maane to sapa-basapa ke mil jane ke baad mulaayam ko takreeban saat lakh vot mil sakate hai
 In such a situation, the scope of change in Mainpuri is almost negligible
 bijepi ne kabhi bhi mainpuri seat nahin jiti he
 In 1967, the Jana Sangh (bjp's predecessor party) first nominated Jagdish Singh as its candidate
 unhen kareeb chhiyaalis hajaar mili the
 After that, BJP did not field any candidate from Mainpuri in the next five Lok Sabha elections
 1991 main bijepi ke ram naresh agnihotri chunaav lade or ek lakh chaudaa hajaar vot paakar duusare sthaan par rahe
 After that Upadesh Singh Chauhan contested elections against Mulayam Singh in 1996, he got 2 votes
 21 lakh jarur mili lekin is baar phir haar mili
 Mulayam's stronghold is dominated by the SP as well as his family
 do upachunaavon sahit pichley paanch lok sabha chunaavon main khud mulaayam unke bhattije dharmendra yadav or pote tej pratap singh ke alaava koi chunaav nahin jeeta he
 Mulayam is going to try to maintain this tradition for the fifth time
 mulaayam yaa sapa kii jeet main jatigat ganit ko sabase badi vajah mana jaataa he
 Of the nearly thirteen lakh voters, 35 per cent are from the Yadav caste while around 29 per cent of the voters are Rajputs
 votaron kaa ye ganit bataata he ki mainpuri seat par upi main yadavon ke sarvamaanya netaaon ko haraana lohe ke chane chabane jaisaa hoga

 People assure him that people of every caste, every religion are respected in Pakistan

 In this video, a Punjabi man wearing a turban stands on different streets
 tabhi vahaan ek yuvak aata he or use gaiyr muslim hone ke chalate desh chhodane ko kahata he
 Seeing all this, people come there and tell the Sikh youth to be a brother in Pakistan with respect
 log use bharosa dilaate hai ki pakistan main har jati, har dharm ke logon kaa sammaan he
 At one place, Muslim Sikhs start to shout with a young man who harasses Sikhs
 vah kahata he ki islam hamen maanavtaa se pyaar karnaa sikhaata he

 288 sadasyon vaali vidhansabha main party ke paas philhal 121 siten hai or rajya main sabase bada dal hone ke naate vah sarkaar bana rahi he haalanki bahumat ke liye party ko kuch ore vidhayakon kii jarurat hogi
 The party has not yet taken a final decision on an alliance with the Shiv Sena
 samaaroh main thakare kii maujuudagi se sanket mila ki vidhansabha chunaav se pehle seat bantwaare ko lekar tut gaya donon dalon kaa gathjod phir se shakl le saktaa he
 All eyes were on Modi and Uddhav at the ceremony, who shook hands and asked each other well
 288 sadasyeey vidhansabha main bhaajapa ke 121 vidhayakon ke saath fadanvis alpamat sarkaar kii aguwai kar rahe hai, jise do saptaah main bahumat sabit karne ko kaha gaya he
 Sharad Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party with 41 mlas has already offered outside support to the new government
 maratha netaaon ke prabhutv vaale maharashtra main fadanvis duusare brahman mukhyamantri bane hai
 Earlier, Shiv Sena's Manohar Joshi was from this community
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se jude rahe or pradhanmantri modi ke kareebi fadanvis rajya ke 27wein mukhyamantri bane hai or is pad par kabiz hone vaale 18wein vyakti hai

 maharashtra main jab bhaajapa ne loksabhaa or rajya vidhansabha chunaavon main jabardast safalataa praapt kii to fadanvis hi party kii kaman sambhaal rahe the
 Uddhav Thackeray sat with Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu and looked calm, but after the swearing-in ceremony was over, he shook hands with Modi and asked him to smile
 shivasena saansad vinayak raut ne bataaya, 'bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne uddhavji ko phone karke aamantrit kiya jiske baad vah devendra fadanvis ke shapath grahan main shaamil hue
 He said, "amit Shah also assured Uddhavji of a positive decision on the participation of Shiv Sena in the new government and we hope that there will be positive results when the talks are held
" ' However, it is not yet clear when the talks will be held to reach a mutually acceptable consensus on the sharing of power between the two parties
 rajyapal raav ne fadanvis ko shapath grahan ke baad vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karne ke liye 15 din kaa samay diya he
 After the death of newly elected BJP MLA Govind Rathore, the party's strength in the House has reached 121, but the party has claimed the support of all the seven Independent mlas and members of some smaller parties
 rakanpa ne kaha he ki agar shakti pareekshan ke dauraan shivasena vipaksh main baithti he to vah matdaan main hissaa nahin legi
 This will help Fadnavis to easily prove his majority
 haalanki sadan main 145 ke jaadui aankade tak pahunchane ke liye fadanvis ke saamne 63 sadasyeey shivasena ko saath main lekar chalane kaa vikalp sabase badhiya samajha ja rahaa he
 Film Review: Chachal Guru Ho Jaa Shore Actor: Hemant Pandey, Brijend Kala, Brajesh Hirji, Sanjay Mishra, Chandrachud Singh, Tiku talsaniadirector: Manoj sharmaduration: 1 hour 56 min
 magar ise dekhte hue sabase pehle aapke dhairya kii pole khulti he
 If you feel that you can afford any chaat film, then take a fresh test of patience by watching it
 film main idhar industry kii ravaayat kii tarj par kai achche actors ko kamjor or ataarkik kahani ke jhol main barbaad kiya gaya he
 It also has sloppy dialogues at some places, and finally a great but possibly ending
 'chal guru ho ja shuru' desh ke tamaam vivaadit baabaaon ke kirdaar se apni aatma, sharir or urja hasil karti he
 It is seen from Asaram and his son Narayan Sai, who are in jail on charges of most communal rape
 iske alaava nirmal baba samet tamaam duusare shoorveer bhi jhalak maarthe hai kendriya kirdaar hariya baba main
 The story of the film is somewhat like that Hariya and Birju are two struggling actors
 dar dar kii thokar khaane ke baad ek baba se prerit ho vah dharm kii dukaan khol lete hai or ye chal nikalati he
 If the money and influence comes, the babes of these Baba's get a place
 phir aakhir main inkaa bhandaphod hota he or sabko gyaan kii raushnee main nahala diya jaataa he
 The intention of the film was good
 desh ko vaaki is tarah kii filmon kii jarurat he, jo andhvishwaason main ghir dhongi babaaon kii jayakaara lagane vaale, unhen apana sarvasv saunpane vaale or unki hit raksha ke liye kuch bhi kar guzarane waalon kii aankh khol sake
 But the film is first a film
 uski kahani majboot honi chahie, kachare kaa cocktail nahin
 He should have smooth communication
 usamen actors kii manjhi hui acting honi chahie
 But 'chal Guru Ho Jaa Start' does not stick to eating a single one of it
 hariya baba ke lead role main hemanth pandey hon yaa unke sahyogi baba ke rup main brajesh hirji
 All of them are seen playing fast gestures on the lines of the gimmick and giving voice and voice in their own jokes
 baba ke sahyogi birju maharaj ke role main brajendra kaala jarur ek baar phir apni acting kaa loha manavaate najar aate hai
 All the other actors do Khanapurti
 film kaa becoground score ho yaa sets yaa phir cinemetography, sab kii sab satahi he
 Director Manoj Sharma disappoints in this film
 is film ko bahut kam screen mili hai
 In such a situation, it is expected that more viewers will not suffer from its beating

 In such a situation, the question arises that will their fans once again feel the freshness of their notes? Now that the government and society have come forward to help Anshu, his fans are seeing a ray of hope
 akashwani kii bi-grad kii gayika evam dilli vishvavidhyalay ke miranda house kii topper anshu ne desh ke vibhinn hisson main 16 bhashaaon main shastreey sangeet ke kai kaarykram die hai, lekin vah puure ek varsh se sangeet kii sadhana se dur hai
 Both Anshu's kidneys are damaged
 keval 27 saal kii umr main apaar khyaati hasil kar chukin anshu aaj sahi dhang se bol bhi nahin paatin
 These days he is undergoing treatment at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) in Patna
 sarkaar ne bhi anshu kii sud lee he or unke ilaaj kaa puraa kharch dene kaa aashwaasan diya he
 Anshu's mother Kiran Bala says that if the people of Patna had not come forward, their daughter might not have been alive today

 After marriage, Anshu made her Piya's home as her hideout, leaving Delhi, Mumbai and Patna, but there she could not find the praise of her singing

 Nobody even encouraged him there
 parijanon ke mutabik anshu jab pehali baar garbhvatee hui thim tabhi uske ek gurde main samasya aa gai thi, lekin vah apane is rog ko chhupaae rahi
 When he started having a lot of trouble in january-february this year, his illness was exposed to everyone
 beemaari ke chalate shaareerik rup se laachaar anshu se uske sasuraal waalon ne bhi kinaaraa kar liya
 After this, as if the mountain of sorrows had broken on Anshu

 After coming to Patna, she ran to Vellore, Delhi and Lucknow for treatment, but could not get treatment properly due to lack of money
 patna main unke ilaaj ko lekar pareshaani ho rahi thi
 The government has transferred Anshu's father Ishwaranand Jha from Jehanabad to Patna, so that he can treat his daughter properly
 jha kehete hai ki anshu ko itani kam umr main hi bade-bade logon kii tarifen mil chuki hai, lekin shaayad unki kismat main thokaren khaanaa likhaa tha

 People hope that Anshu will definitely get well and his Karnapriya notes will be heard once again

 By the way, the women's campaign has also brought color
 khabar he ki ek sadak kii marammat kaa kaam shuru ho gaya he
 Let me tell you that the condition of this road is so bad that it takes 14 hours to reach the nearby hospital and many times they die in needy way
 mahilaon ne sadakon kii kharaab haalat ke khilaaf sabase pehle saal 2011 main sex strike kii thi
 Then a woman and her unborn child were killed because the ambulance got stuck in the road and they could not reach the hospital in time
 us samay jaj maribel silva bhi hadtaal main shaamil huin thim
 Then the leader of the strike, Ruby said, "why should we bring children in a world where they die just because they cannot get treatment and we cannot even give them basic rights?" We have decided that until the condition of the roads is not correct, we will neither do sex nor produce children
 'hadtaal ke 19 din baad shahar ke do rajanetaaon ne vaada kiya sadakon kii haalat thik kii jaaegi or sarkaar kam se kam 35 mile sadak kaa nirmaan bhi kargi
 But after two years, nothing happened

 ) The incident in Srinagar NIT and the gap in politics has increased so much that the students there now have to stand with a plank in their hands to not communalize our issues
 campus ke bheetar media ke jane kii ijazat nahin he phir bhi whatsap or twitor ke zariye lagaataar afvaah failaai ja rahi he ki media jaanboojh kar nahin ja rahaa he
 Hyderabad Central University also stopped the media outside the gate
 kai dinon kii pabandi ke baad buudhvaar ko jab chaatro ne is bairicade ko todane kaa prayaas kiya to 70 chaatro ko hiraasat main le liya gaya
 At JNU, there was no bar for the media to go in and talk to students and broadcast live from there
 phir bhi afvahabaazon kii sankhya itani he ki ve har jagah failaa chuke hai ki media enaiti srinagar nahin ja rahaa he
 Even today our colleague Neeta Sharma went to Srinagar but due to lack of permission she could not go inside the campus
 sthaneey chaatro ko hi baahar se campus main jane diya ja rahaa he lekin jo campus ke bheetar ke chaatr hai unhen suraksha kaarnon se baahar nahin jane diya ja rahaa he
 Internet bandwidth within the campus has also been reduced so that students cannot send out videos through social sites
 nita sharma ne kaha ki guuruuvaar ko chaatraon ne get tak ek march bhi nikaala lekin uski tasviren media ko na mil saken iske liye get ke saamne police ne bade bade trek khadey kar diye
 Still the media got some pictures
 vaise netaaon ke aane par bhi roak laga di gai he
 Have you read any such messages from whatsapp rumors that the administration should let the media in so that the status of NIT campus can come out
 aapmen se kai log bina tathyon kii padtaal kiye yakeen bhi kar lete hai
 Now is this the fault of the four media journalists that the fear of the teachers and directors of the campus within the campus, the student students have to make a masked statement
 inhen dar he ki cheharaa saamne aane par number kaat liye jaaenge
 Whose government is in the state, the directors of NIT report to the media or to the Ministry of Human Resources
 ab suniye or dekhiye bhi
 State administration says that investigation has started and report will come in 15 days
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay kii team kaa kahana he ki wo imtahaan khatm hone tak campus main rukegi
 Students who want to go tell this team, arrangements will be made for their departure
 cameti se jo bhi baat karnaa chahta he unke liye sabhi sadsy kabhi bhi uplabdh hai
 Even after this, the students are not satisfied
 chatraayen kah rahi hai ki hamaara mudda suraksha he, hamaare mudde kaa sampradayikaran mat kiijie
 Why nits or media journalists who are covering their faces within the campus will be responded to by being called secularists is being grossly lewd
 soshal media ke girohon ko kya ye sawaal nahin uthaanaa chahie ki centre sarkaar ke santhaan ke campus main siarpief or police kii suraksha ke bich ladke ladakiyon ko cheharaa kyon chhipaana pad rahaa he

 Students are calling on the Minister of Human Resources and pleading for justice from the Prime Minister
 vahiin chinar ground main puure din chaatr jamaa rahe
 They say that they will stay here at night too
 nita sharma ne chaatr chaatraon ke mata-pita se baat kii he
 They are very concerned about the safety of their children and they are also of the opinion that in the current situation the NIT should be shifted or their children transferred to another NIT
 is bare main centre sarkaar kii taraf se koi aashwaasan yaa bayaan nahin aayaa he
 You might have seen a video on Wednesday in which a gathering of students is taking place with the team of local police officers, Ministry of Human Resources
 is video ko dekhakar laga ki chaatro kii sari maange maan lee gayi hongi or jammu-kashmir police ke adhikariyon ke kilaaf karrwai bhi ho gai hogi
 Actually, this is exactly the opposite
 jisaki jaankaree aage duungaa
 In this video you will see that the students are standing on the stage and telling what their demands are
 jammu kashmir police ke adhikariyon ko hataaya jaae, enaiti ko rajya se baahar shift kiya jaae
 Teachers should be removed
 kaash aisa mauka hyderabad or jeenyu ke chaatro ko bhi miltaa lekin aisa mauka apatiai ke chaatro ko mila tha
 The Union Minister of Information spoke to him
 bhale unki maang na maani gai ho
 The students are quite excited in the video but are now apprehensive whether their fight will reach any destination or not
 jammu kashmir police ke kisi adhikari ke kilaaf koi karrwai nahin hui he
 On the contrary, the police has filed an FIR against two students on charges of sabotage
 khabaron ke mutabik NIT prashasan 31 chaatro ke kilaaf karrwai karne kii soch rahaa he
 non-kashmiri students, who are students of all religions of other states, Hindu Muslims are Sikh Christians, some of them say that they are stuck because of communalization of the issue
 do video aae hai
 a video by the students and then of the police showing the students vandalizing
 ye tasviren chaatro ke taraf se di gayi hai jinamein police ek chaatr ko gher kar berahami se maar rahi he
 a student has been hit by five six policemen
 in tasveeron ko dekhakar laga ki police ne chaatro ke saath krurta barti he, jo ki dikh bhi rahaa he
 The students say that the girl students have also been beaten and the students facing physical challenges were also beaten
 chaatraon kaa kahana he ki unhen fail karne se lekar balaatkaar tak kii dhamkee di ja rahi he
 After a while the police released a video on their behalf
 police ke is video main chaatr ek car par pathar barasaa rahe hai
 Are ransacked
 police par pathar maar rahe hai
 Now it is not clear whether the students first stoned or the students vandalized after police sticks
 yah sab jaanch kaa vishay he
 The media is presenting it as the reason why the sticks on the patriots, many people are raising this patriotic question to make some unknown secularists thunder
 lekin aap apni ankhon se dekhiye or dimag se sochiye ki lathi kiske aadesh se chali, takaraav kyon hua
 There are two types of videos and many types of rumors
 faisla kar lijie
 According to the media, these are patriots, so why is the NIT talking about taking action against them
 police ne exiaar kyon kii he
 The India Today website has written that the rss-backed Jammu Kashmir Study Circle says that it is not that all Kashmiri students are against students from outside
 na hi sabhi kashmiri cricket main bharat ke haarane par khush hote hai
 The NIT incident suggests that separatist elements have made inroads into educational institutions
 inhen baahar karnaa hoga
 Had the influence of separatist elements increased there, such an incident would not have happened before
 khud gaiyr kashmiri chaatr is saal ke pehle tak sthaneey chaatro se takaraav kii koi baat nahin bataa paa rahe hai
 There was a clash about the tricolor
 lekin jinhone pakistan kaa jhanda laharaaya kya unke khilaaf exiaar hui he
 You will ask this question or get angry on two or four journalists
 koi jaanch cameti bithai gai
 Like JNU, rumors have been spread all over the country and people have started believing again
 chaatro kii ladaai college prashasan se he
 They do not want any police action against Kashmiri students
 unhen bharosa nahin he to apane college ke prashasan par
 The comments is tarah ke maahaul ke asar main rajasthan ke chittorgarh kii mewar uniwarsity se 16 kashmiri chaatro ko 25 april tak ke liye nilambit kar diya gaya
 The college had a clash after the India West Indies match
 uske pehle yahaan ke 4 kashmiri ladakon ko bif khaane ke aarope main pakadaa gaya tha, peeta bhi gaya
 The police later said that the Veterinary Board in its report said that the meat eaten was not beef
 abhi forencik jaanch kaa intazaar he
 Whatever facts you keep on NIT Srinagar, you will reach the same which is being spread through whatsapp in various types of messages
 lekin ham phir bhi baat karenge
 Hyderabad Central University also stopped the media outside the gate
 kai dinon kii pabandi ke baad buudhvaar ko jab chaatro ne is bairicade ko todane kaa prayaas kiya to 70 chaatro ko hiraasat main le liya gaya
 At JNU, there was no bar for the media to go in and talk to students and broadcast live from there
 phir bhi afvahabaazon kii sankhya itani he ki ve har jagah failaa chuke hai ki media enaiti srinagar nahin ja rahaa he
 Even today our colleague Neeta Sharma went to Srinagar but due to lack of permission she could not go inside the campus
 sthaneey chaatro ko hi baahar se campus main jane diya ja rahaa he lekin jo campus ke bheetar ke chaatr hai unhen suraksha kaarnon se baahar nahin jane diya ja rahaa he
 Internet bandwidth within the campus has also been reduced so that students cannot send out videos through social sites
 nita sharma ne kaha ki guuruuvaar ko chaatraon ne get tak ek march bhi nikaala lekin uski tasviren media ko na mil saken iske liye get ke saamne police ne bade bade trek khadey kar diye
 Still the media got some pictures
 vaise netaaon ke aane par bhi roak laga di gai he
 Have you read any such messages from whatsapp rumors that the administration should let the media in so that the status of NIT campus can come out
 aapmen se kai log bina tathyon kii padtaal kiye yakeen bhi kar lete hai
 Now is this the fault of the four media journalists that the fear of the teachers and directors of the campus within the campus, the student students have to make a masked statement
 inhen dar he ki cheharaa saamne aane par number kaat liye jaaenge
 Whose government is in the state, the directors of NIT report to the media or to the Ministry of Human Resources
 ab suniye or dekhiye bhi
 State administration says that investigation has started and report will come in 15 days
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay kii team kaa kahana he ki wo imtahaan khatm hone tak campus main rukegi
 Students who want to go tell this team, arrangements will be made for their departure
 cameti se jo bhi baat karnaa chahta he unke liye sabhi sadsy kabhi bhi uplabdh hai
 Even after this, the students are not satisfied
 chatraayen kah rahi hai ki hamaara mudda suraksha he, hamaare mudde kaa sampradayikaran mat kiijie
 Why nits or media journalists who are covering their faces within the campus will be responded to by being called secularists is being grossly lewd
 soshal media ke girohon ko kya ye sawaal nahin uthaanaa chahie ki centre sarkaar ke santhaan ke campus main siarpief or police kii suraksha ke bich ladke ladakiyon ko cheharaa kyon chhipaana pad rahaa he
 In this picture girls are standing with folded hands
 nivedan tip aisa pradarshan maine nahin dekha tha, aam taur par chaatro ke pradarshan main mutthiyaan hi laharaai jaati hai
 Students are calling on the Minister of Human Resources and pleading for justice from the Prime Minister
 vahiin chinar ground main puure din chaatr jamaa rahe
 They say that they will stay here at night too
 nita sharma ne chaatr chaatraon ke mata-pita se baat kii he
 They are very concerned about the safety of their children and they are also of the opinion that in the current situation the NIT should be shifted or their children transferred to another NIT
 is bare main centre sarkaar kii taraf se koi aashwaasan yaa bayaan nahin aayaa he
 You might have seen a video on Wednesday in which a gathering of students is taking place with the team of local police officers, Ministry of Human Resources
 is video ko dekhakar laga ki chaatro kii sari maange maan lee gayi hongi or jammu-kashmir police ke adhikariyon ke kilaaf karrwai bhi ho gai hogi
 Actually, this is exactly the opposite
 jisaki jaankaree aage duungaa
 In this video you will see that the students are standing on the stage and telling what their demands are
 jammu kashmir police ke adhikariyon ko hataaya jaae, enaiti ko rajya se baahar shift kiya jaae
 Teachers should be removed
 kaash aisa mauka hyderabad or jeenyu ke chaatro ko bhi miltaa lekin aisa mauka apatiai ke chaatro ko mila tha
 The Union Minister of Information spoke to him
 bhale unki maang na maani gai ho
 The students are quite excited in the video but are now apprehensive whether their fight will reach any destination or not
