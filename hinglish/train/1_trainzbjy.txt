 Former IB IB Special Director Rajinder Kumar is said to be behind the affidavit filed by the Ministry of Home Affairs to declare Ishrat Jahan a terrorist
 rajendar kumaar ishrat jahaan muthbhed maamle main kathith rup se hatya ke aaropee hai
 In the supplementary charge sheet filed by the CBI in the encounter case, the investigating agency alleged that Kumar had informed the Home Ministry that Ishrat was a terrorist
 unhone us muthbhed ko sahi tehraane ke liye yah baat kahi thi jisamen mumbai kii 19 varshiya ishrat teen anya logon ke saath maari gai thi
 CBI sources have given this information

 30 sitambar 2009 ko daakhil kiye gaye ek anya halafname main kaha gaya tha ki is baat ko sabit karne vaale koi nirnaayak saboot nahin hai ki vah aatankwaadi thi
 The agency alleges that the affidavit filed on August 6, 2009 was a brainchild of Kumar as he feared his role would come under scrutiny in the event of an extensive investigation into the encounter
 is muthbhed ko sibiai ne farji bataaya tha
 a senior CBI officer said, "nothing changes the fact that it was an anti-terrorism joint operation of the IB and the Gujarat Police which turned into a fake encounter
" chaaron peediton kii prishthbhumi is tathy ko nahin badalati ki yah ek farji muthbhed thi
 'nearly a decade after Ishrat and two others were killed in Gujarat along with their friend Javed Sheikh alias Parnesh Pillai, the CBI has filed a supplementary charge sheet, which names Kumar, who was then appointed in Gujarat and was the joint director of the IB

 parivaar pyaar se chalata he vyapaar se nahin, parivaar moh se chalata he lobh se nahin, parivaar samvednaa se chalata he irshyaa sa nahin, parivaar sulah se chalat he kalah se nahin
 Therefore, the United Nations has to run by the principle of family

 If you follow the same principle then you will be able to survive

 sarkaar karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi (epf)ke niyamon main kai bade badlaav karne ke mood main he
 If these new rules come into force, EPF will be deducted by mixing all allowances with basic salary, which will reduce the take home salary
 'times of india' kii khabar ke mutabik, sarkaar ne nae niyamon kaa draft banaakar andruni taur par use circulet bhi kar liya he
 a few years ago these new rules were drafted, but these rules were not implemented after opposition from the industry chambers as it would have put more financial burden on the companies
 sarkaar kii yojana un companiyon ko bhi EPF ke daayre main shaamil karne kii hai, jahaan karmchaariyon kii sankhya 20 se kam he
 According to the EPF rules, currently the same companies come under its ambit, which has a minimum number of 20 employees
 jaaniye sarkaar EPF main kya-kya badlaav chaahati he--karmchaariyon ke 12 fisadi EPF yogadan kaa niyam nahin rahegaa, lekin companiyon ko itnaa share dena hoga
 Instead of cutting EPF on basic salary, EPF should be deducted on the entire salary after adding all allowances to the basic salary
 -un companiyon ko bhi EPF ke daayre main laayaa jaae, jinamein 20 se kam karmchaaree hai

 ) desh main kisi tarah kii banking chrysis nahin he, upie sarkaar ke dauraan yah thi
 In 2008, the slowdown began at the international level
 iskaa asar bharat par bhi padaa lekin aaj aisa nahin he
 The UPA government looted the country's wealth
 upie sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan saadhe aath lakh karod enpie tha use kaagaj main dhai lakh karod rupee dikhaa diya gaya
 This is to say Finance Minister Arun Jaitley
 agenda ajtak main pahunche jetali ne kaha ki upie sarkaar ne vicitra prakaar kii niti apanaai
 Those who were unable to provide loans were restructured
 bainkon ke daravaaje khol die gaye ki jisko jitna paisa chahie le lo
 When the economy is good then it is considered fine but when it is a recession, it has to suffer
 jinhen dobaaraa karj die gaye wo na to karj waapas kar paae or na hi byaaj de paae
 Jaitley said that after this the UPA government did another strange act which was a crime
 upie ke kaarykaal ke dauranenpie8
 5 lakh crores, 2 in the paper
 5 lakh karod kaa kar diya gaya
 The Reserve Bank also kept watching it
 endie sarkaar ne bainkon ko badahaali se nikaalane kaa prayaas kiya
 Jaitley said that the money Mallya took was during the tenure of the UPA government
 bijepi kii sarkaar aate hi use waapas laane kii koshishen huin
 The government is also succeeding in that
 jetali ne congress par aarope lagaaya ki upie sarkaar ne desh ke paise ko lutaa diya
 Jaitley said that there is no threat to the autonomy of the Reserve Bank
 desh kii sarkaar chuni hui hoti he or usase public ko jawaab dena hota he
 The Reserve Bank does not have to answer this
 isliye tarah-tarah ke tantra istemaal karke usamen pradhanmantri ke str par meeting hoti he, arabiai kii board meeting or koshish kii jaae ki is liquidity or credit ke mudde ko hal kariye
 This is not such a simple subject
 hindustan kaa raajnneetik polytical media ise samaj nahin paaya
 Jaitley said that maintaining liquidity is good for the market
 unhone udhaaharan ke saath ise samajhaayaa ki agar aapane ek builder se ghar kharida he
 If you are not able to pay EMI and the builder does not have the money to build the house, then it is bound to be a problem
 halaat aise rahenge to cement kaa utpaadan giregaa, lohe kaa utpaadan giregaa
 Jaitley claimed that neither for the budget nor for the work of the government did he need one rupee from the RBI but it would have to be seen how much Reserve Fund the RBI needed
 mumbai ke vankhede stadium par khele ja rahe bharat or england ke bich ke duusare test match kaa doosraa din puri tarah se mehmaanon ke naam rahaa
 Alistair Cook and Kevin Pietersen gave England a good start by playing half-century innings
 jabaki duusare din bhartiya pari 327 ranon par simat gai thi
 England captain Cook 87 and experienced batsman Peterson returned unbeaten after scoring 62 runs
 donon ke bich abhi tak 110 ranon kii saajhedaari ho chuki he
 The second day of Mumbai Test started with 6 wickets for 266 runs of Team India
 cheteshwar pujaara or aar aswin ne pehle din ke score main abhi tak 14 ran hi jode the ki monti panesar ne bharat ko saatvaan jhatka de diya
 Ashwin returned to the pavilion after scoring 68 runs off 114 balls with 9 fours
 iske baad harbhajan singh ne 35 gendon par 21 ranon kii pari khelkar pujaara ke saath score ko 300 ke paar pahunchaaya
 Bhajji was made his prey by Graeme Swann
 iske baad pujaara kii bhi pari kaa ant hua, swaan ne apane agle hi over main pujaara ko match praayar ke haathon stump out karakar bharat ko bada jhatka diya
 Pujara faced 350 balls during his century and scored 135 runs with the help of 12 fours
 pujaara ke out hone ke baad jahir khan (11) or pragyan ojha (naabad 0) ne milakar bharat kaa score 327 ranon tak pahunchaaya
 Zaheer Khan was the last batsman to be dismissed in the first innings for Team India
 unhen bhi swaan ne pavilion kaa rasta dikhaaya
 England's start was not too good after the Indian innings before lunch and the guests got the first blow on 66 runs
 pragyan ojha ne nik compton ko virendra sahvaag ke haathon kaich karakar england ko pehla jhatka diya
 Jonathan Trott then returned to the pavilion in the next over of Ojha without opening an account
 trot ko ojha ne elbeadblyoo out kiya
 However, after this, Kevin Pietersen, along with Captain Cook, not only handled the innings but also gave England a strong position till the end of the day's play
 cook ne 134 gendon par ardhashatak jadaa jabaki petersan ko 50 ranon tak pahunchane ke liye mahaj 63 gendon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Panesar took 5 wickets for England, 4 wickets from James Anderson

 The Comptroller and Auditor General of India, CAG reported the strange situation
 sarkari paksh nahin chahta ki is report ko koi or dekh le, vipaksh nahin dekh paata kyonki is report main unki sarkaron ke bare main bhi tippaniyan hoti hai
 Going through the CAG report, you can understand the condition of all the departments in all the states
 kahin record hi nahin rakhaa jaataa, kahin zyaada pement ho gaya to kahin kisaanon ko vaazib haq na mili iske liye bainkon ne hi jaanboojh kar deree kar di
 The CAG report should be read in its spare time
 isse pataa chalegaa ki mahange vigyapanon main jo daawey kiye jate hai unke peeche kaa khel kya he
 CAG report on crop insurance plans should be seen
 is report se pataa chalata he ki kisaanon ke liye yojanaon ke elaan or unke zamin par utarane main kitne aasmaanon kaa fark he
 Since 1985, there have been experiments in India about the insurance scheme for crops
 2016 main jab pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana lagu hui to iskaa khub prachaar hua
 Some conditions are already very good
 magar iske baad bhi sieji kii report padhane se yahi lagata he ki is yojana kaa koi maai baap nahin he
 Under the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, farmers pay a part of the premium and the rest is shared by the Central and State Governments
 iske liye privet beemaa companiyaan bhi hai or ek sarkari agriculture insurance company eisi bhi he
 The government gives money to the AIC, now the job of the AIC is to hand over the money to the private insurance companies so that they can further provide insurance to the farmers
 in companiyon ko bina kisi guideline kii sharton ko puraa kiye hue kaise hazaron karod rupee de diye gaye
 Can any common farmer ask these private insurance companies, who got the insurance of his share or his area
 sieji ne 2011-12 se lekar 2015-16 ke bich fasal beemaa yojana kii samiksha kii he
 From the results that have come out, it seems that this scheme is not for the farmers but for them
 agar hoti to phir sieji ko kyon kahana padaa ki teen dashak se beemaa yojanaayen hai phir bhi bahut kam kisaan inke daayre main aae hai
 Very few small and marginal farmers have been covered under crop insurance coverage
 essi / asti kisaanon ke beemaa ke liye bhi praavdhaan he magar unka koi data nahin he
 The scheme is for those farmers who take loans for farming
 kai baar kisaan kheti ke karz kaa beemaa karaate hai, fasal kii nahin
 Banks do not disclose insurance provisions to farmers
 kis kisaan kaa beemaa hua he, uskaa data na centre sarkaar ke paas he na rajya sarkaar ke paas
 Even the insurance company does not maintain AIC
 guideline main data rakhane kii baadhyataa kyon nahin jodi gai he
 Nowadays there is talk of Digital India and Data India but there is no data of which farmer has been insured under crores of crores insurance scheme
 yah suvidha kisaanon ke liye he yaa kisi or ke liye
 The report said that the difference between how much area has been sown in the crop and how much area has been insured is seen in a taluka of Maharashtra, in the kharif season of 2015, 51,397 hectares of land was sown while the area of insurance cover was shown
 1,11,615 ha, twice the sowing
 sieji kaa maananaa he ki dabl beemaa liye jane kii sambhaavna ke sanket milte hai
 For this, the bank records of three taluks of Beed district were reversed
 pataa chalaa ki kisaanon ko ek hi fasal kaa beemaa do-teen baar mila
 The CAG states that the data given by the state governments cannot be trusted
 yojana kii nigaraanee ke liye koi prabhaavshaalee mechanism nahin he
 When there is no monitoring, there is no data and there is a difference between what is there, then what is left
 kya yahi kahana rah gaya ki ho saktaa he ki bade str par herapheri ho rahi he
 There is no guidance on what will happen to the remaining amount if a claim is taken less than the sum insured
 2011-16 ke dauraan eisi ne 10 beemaa companiyon ko 3,622 karod rupee jari kar diye
 For this, the terms of the guidelines were not taken care of and failed to give reasons
 eisi ne sunishchit nahin kiya ki bainkon ko utilizeshan certificate dena hi hoga
 This is the condition of the scheme in front of which the Prime Minister is attached and the politics of the country which affects day and night
 fasal beemaa yojana ke tahat sarkaar kai hazaar karod privet beemaa companiyon ko premium kii sabsidi detii he
 There is no provision of audit to check whether private companies are giving them to farmers
 kai baar bank bhi kisaanon kaa data dene main deree karte hai
 Sometimes the account number goes wrong, sometimes the account number is given wrong
 bank kaam kaa dabaav bataate hai
 All this is stated by the CAG in its report after investigation
 maharashtra ke chaar zilon main 9 bainkon ne kisaanon ke daavon kaa 72 karod rupaya roak liya
 a cooperative bank also gave a certificate to distribute claims worth 101 crores while 98 crores remained in the account of the branch itself
 bhartiya rail ko modi sarkaar ke kaabil mantriyon main se ek suresh prabhu chalaate hai lekin sieji ne bhartiya rail ke liye tikat booking, paryaton se lekar khan-paan tak kaa zimmaa sanbhaalane vaali IRCTC ke kaam or quality kii jo audit report di he wo kaaphi gambhir he
 One has to think that all this is happening as Suresh Prabhu's Railway Minister, which is considered good, then how is it possible that the Zonal Railways had to make a master plan of catering services in every station and trains but seven Zonal Railways have given this Blue print was not made
 niti bani ki train kii pentry car main gas ke burner nahin honge, sabko electric kiya jayega, iske baavjood integrated coach factory ne april 2011 se march 2016 ke bich alpiji silendar vaali 103 pentry car banaakar zonal railway ko deen
 115 base kitchens were outside the railway premises where there was no quality check facility
 74 steshnon main se 46 main jan aahaar centre hi nahin the jabaki railway board ne zonal railways ko kifayati daamon main khaanaa uplabdh karaane ke liye jan aahaar centre banane ke aadesh die the
 a joint investigation of 74 stations and 80 trains revealed that cleanliness was not maintained in the catering units
 nal ke pani kaa hi istemaal khaane pine ke saamaan main hua
 The dustbin was open and filled with a lot of dirt
 khaane-pine ke saamaan ko mackhiyon, keedon, dhul, chuhon or cockroach vagairah se bachaane ke liye dhak kar nahin rakhaa gaya tha
 Sales of food items in trains and stations are being rigged, bills for food items purchased in mobile units of the train were not being paid
 khaadya saamagree tay maatra se kam di ja rahi thim
 Packaged drinking water of inferior quality was being sold without approval
 ye bhi kaha gaya he ki kai baar khaane kii quality aisi nahin thi ki wo kisi insaan ko di jaae, khaane-pine kaa dooshit yaa expyri date vaala saamaan yatriyon ko diya ja rahaa tha
 The CAG report said that 11 crore surcharge was collected from passengers for superfast rail but some super fast trains continued to be 95 percent late
 ab aate hai jan swasthya par
 The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was started in 2005 for the health of the people of the village to prevent the death of child and mother at birth
 sieji ne 2011 se march 2016 tak kaa hisaab kitaab kiya he
 Poll of this plan is also seen
 27 rajyon ne is mad kaa paisa kharch hi nahin kiya
 This amount was 7,375 crores in 2011-12 which increased to 9509 crores in 2015-16
 6 rajya aise hai jahaan 36
 An amount of 31 crores was put in some other scheme
 jin yojanaon kaa sambandh garib auraton or navjaat se he un yojanaon kaa paisa bhi saat hazaar karod or nau hazaar karod kharch nahin hoga to kya mana jaae
 Do these schemes revolve on paper and return to Delhi or the state capital
 bihar, jharkhand, sikkim, uttarakhand, pashchim bengal main primary health centre, community health centre ab bhi 50% kam hai
 There are hundreds of health centers which are working in dirty conditions
 20 rajyon main 1285 project kaagazon main puure ho chuke hai magar asaliyat main shuru bhi nahin hue hai
 There are 17 states where machines like ultrasound, X-ray, eshiji worth 30 crores are lying
 vahaan medical staff nahin he, rakhane kii jagah tak nahin he
 Don't you think that the public is joking
 27 rajyon ke lagbhag har swasthya centre main 77 se 87 fisadi doctoron kii kami he
 When there is no doctor, then why do governments not make such advertisements that we are planning but are not delivering it? bagair doctor ke liye enarechaem kaa paisa kaise kharch ho rahaa hoga
 There were 67 health centers in 13 states where there were no doctors
 anemia sharir main aayran kii kami kii beemaari he or mahilaon or bacchon main anemia ke maamle main bharat duniya main top par he
 Fifty percent of mothers who die during childbirth die due to anemia
 iske baad bhi sieji ne sabhi rajyon ke praathmik kendron main paaya ki aayran tablet di hi nahin ja rahi hai
 a pregnant woman is required to give one hundred folic acid tablets to the NRHM center
 audit main paaya gaya ki sabhi 28 rajyon main 3 se 75 fisadi kii kami mili yani tablet die hi nahin gaye
 In Arunachal, Jammu Kashmir, Manipur, Meghalaya, 50% of pregnant women could not get tetanus vaccine
 tippaniyan The CAG investigated 3 general hospitals in Gujarat
 nadiad general aspataal main apressant theatre to he lekin oparation ke pehle or baad mariz ko rakhane ke liye kamare nahin hai
 If you take the patient directly to the operation theater, from there to the ward directly, then there is an increased risk of infection
 isi aspataal main jagah kii kami ke kaaran lab kaa kaam bhi marizon ke vatting aria main hi chal rahaa tha
 The General Hospital of Godhra requires 440 beds but due to 210, patients are found on the ground
 jharkhand main 17 primary health centre kii imaarat hi nahin he
 Out of 32 special treatment facilities in 5 district hospitals, only 6 to 14 facilities were available
 yani jitani beemaari kaa ilaaj hona chahie, nahin ho rahaa he
 Kerala has more than 1100 cschis and only 23 delivery facilities at PHC
 bihar main janani suraksha yojana ke tahat 40 fisadi yogya mahilaon ko nahin diye gaye
 It was found in the audit that there are too many errors in the annual accounts of 15 states
 raseedon main, kharchon main kam-zyaada dikhaaya gaya he, hisaab bhi thik se nahin rakhaa gaya he
 In its conclusion, the CAG has written that both the Center and the states have not done satisfactory work in terms of spending money
 sieji kii report se nazaren churaane se koi laabh nahin
 It is better to talk and make the system transparent and try to land on the ground
 1985 se bharat main fasalon ke liye beemaa yojana ko lekar prayog ho rahe hai
 When the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana was implemented in 2016, it was widely publicized
 kuch sharten to pehle se kaaphi acchhee hai bhi
 But even after reading the CAG report, it seems that the scheme has no mother
 pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana ke tahat kisaan premium kaa ek hissaa dete hai baaki hissaa centre or rajya sarkaar milakar dete hai
 There are also private insurance companies and AIC, a government agricultural insurance company
 sarkaar to eisi ko paisa de detii he, ab eisi kaa kaam he ki wo privet beemaa companiyon ko paisa pakadaae taaki wo aage kisaanon ko beemaa de saken
 How thousands of crores of rupees were given to these companies without fulfilling the guidelines of the guidelines
 kya koi aam kisaan in privet beemaa companiyon se puch saktaa he ki uske hisse kaa yaa uske ilaake kaa beemaa kis kis ko mila
 The CAG has reviewed the crop insurance scheme between 2011-12 to 2015-16
 jo nattejey saamne aae hai usase yahi lagata he ki yah yojana kisaanon ke liye hote hue bhi unke liye nahin he
 If it was, then why did the CAG have to say that there are insurance schemes for three decades, yet very few farmers have come under their purview
 bahut hi kam chote or seemaant kisaan fasal beemaa ke kawarej main aa sake hai
 There is also a provision for insurance of SC / ST farmers but there is no data for them
 skim unheen kisaanon ke liye he jo kheti ke liye karz lete hai
 Many times the farmers insure the loan of the farm and not the crop
 bank kisaanon ko beemaa praavdhaanon ke bare main nahin bataate hai
 The data of which farmer is insured is neither with the central government nor with the state government
 yahaan tak ki beemaa company eisi bhi nahin rakhti he
 Why is the data holding obligation not added to the guideline
 aajkal digital india or data india kii hi baat hoti he lekin hazaron karodon kii fasal beemaa yojana ke tahat kis kisaan kaa beemaa hua he uskaa koi data hi nahin he
 This facility is for farmers or someone else
 report main kaha gaya he ki fasal kii buvaai kitne aria main hui or beemaa kitne aria kaa hua donon main antar dekha gaya he maharashtra ke ek taluka main 2015 ke kharif sizan main 51,397 hectare zamin main dhan kii buvaai hui jabaki beemaa cover kaa aria dikhaaya gaya 1,11,615 hectare, buvaai se bhi dugana
 The CAG believes that there is a possibility of taking double insurance
 iske liye bid zile kii teen talukaaon ke bank record ko palata gaya
 It was found that farmers got insurance for the same crop two or three times
 sieji kaa kahana he ki rajya sarkaron ke die gaye data par bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 There is no effective mechanism for monitoring the scheme
 jab nigaraanee nahin he, data he nahin or jo he usamen antar he to phir bachaa kya
 Is it possible to say that there may be a lot of rigging
 agar beemaa kii raashi se kam daawa liya gaya to bachi hui raashi kaa kya hoga isaki koi guidelaan nahin he
 During 2011-16, AIC released Rs 3,622 crore to 10 insurance companies
 iske liye guideline kii sharton kii parvaah bhi nahin kii gai or kaaran bataane main asafal rahi
 AIC did not ensure that banks would have to give a Utilization Certificate
 ye us skim kii haalat he jiske naam ke aage pradhanmantri judaa hua he or desh kii raajnneeti jisase din raat prabhavit hoti rahati he
 Under the crop insurance scheme, the government subsidizes premiums to several thousand crore private insurance companies
 privet companiyaan kisaanon ko de rahi hai yaa nahin isaki jaanch ke liye audit kaa koi praavdhaan hi nahin rakhaa gaya he
 Many times banks also delay in giving data of farmers
 kabhi khaataa number galat nikal jaataa he to kabhi khaataa number galat de diya jaataa he
 Banks report work pressure
 ye sab sieji ne jaanch ke baad apni report main kaha he
 In four districts of Maharashtra, 9 banks withheld the claims of farmers amounting to Rs 72 crore
 ek kooparative bank ne 101 karod ke daawey baant dene kaa certificate bhi de diya jabaki 98 karod branch ke khate main hi pade rahe
 Indian Railways is run by Suresh Prabhu, one of the able ministers of the Modi government, but the CAG has given an audit report on the work and quality of IRCTC, which handles ticket booking, tourism, food for Indian Railways, is very serious
 is
 sochna pad rahaa he ki suresh prabhu ke rail mantri rahete ye sab ho rahaa he jinhen acha mana jaataa he to phir yah kaise mumkin he ki zonal railway ko har stesan or trainon main katering sevaaon kaa master plan banaakar dena tha lekin saat zonal railways ne ye blue print banaakar nahin diya
 The policy was made that the train pantry car would not have gas burners, all would be electrified, yet the Integrated Coach Factory made 103 pantry cars with LPG cylinders from April 2011 to March 2016 to Zonal Railways
 115 base kichan railway parisaron ke baahar the jahaan gunvattta kii jaanch kii koi suvidha nahin thi
 Out of the 74 stations, 46 did not have mass feeding centers whereas the Railway Board had ordered Zonal Railways to set up mass feeding centers to provide food at affordable prices
 74 steshnon or 80 trainon kii sanyukt jaanch se pataa chalaa ki katering units main saafe safaai nahin rakhi gai thi
 Tap water was used only for food and drink
 dustbin khule hue the or unamem kaafii gandagi bhari thi
 Food and drinks were not covered to protect them from flies, insects, dust, mice and cockroaches, etc
 trainon or steshnon main khaane-pine ke saamaan kii bikri main kaafii dhaandhlee ho rahi he, train kii mobile units main khride gaye khaane-pine ke saamaan ke bill nahin die ja rahe the
 Food items were being given less than the prescribed quantity
 bina manzuri ke ghatiya quality kaa pine kaa packaged pani bechaa ja rahaa tha
 It has also been said that many times the quality of food was not such that it was given to any human being, food was being given to passengers with contaminated food or expiry date
 sieji kii report main kaha gaya he ki yatriyon se superfast rail ke liye 11 karod sarcharge to vasuul liya gaya magar kuch super fast railgadiyaan 95 fisadi let chalati raheen
 Now come to public health
 gaanv ke logon ke swasthya ke liye 2005 main rashtriya gramin swasthya mishan (enarechaem) kii shuruyaat hui thi taaki paidaa hone ke vakt bachche or maa kii hone vaali maut ko roka ja sake
 The CAG has booked the accounts from 2011 to March 2016
 is yojana kii bhi pole khulti nazar aa rahi he
 27 states did not spend the money for this item
 2011-12 main yah rakam 7,375 karod thi jo 2015-16 main badhkar 9509 karod ho gai
 There are 6 states where 36
 31 karod kii raashi kisi or yojana main laga di gai
 If the schemes, which are related to poor women and newborn, the money of those schemes will not be spent seven thousand crores and nine thousand crores, then what to believe
 kya ye yojanaayen kagaz par hi ghumphir kar waapas dilli yaa rajyon kii rajdhani main laut aati hai
 Primary health centers, community health centers in Bihar, Jharkhand, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, West Bengal are still 50% less
 saikadon aise swasthya centre hai jo gande halaat main kaam kar rahe hai
 In 20 states, 1285 projects have been completed on paper but have not actually started
 17 rajya hai jahaan 30 karod kii ultrasound, eks re, isiji jaisi mashine padi hui hai
 There is no medical staff, there is not even a place to keep it
 kya aapako lagata nahin ki janata ke saath mazaaq ho rahaa he
 Almost every health center in 27 states has a shortage of 77 to 87 percent doctors
 jab doctor hi nahin hai tab sarkarein aisa vigyaapan kyon nahin banaati hai ki ham yojana to bana rahe hai magar pahunchaa nahin rahe hai
 How would NRHM money be spent for a doctor? 13 rajyon main to 67 swasthya centre mili jahaan par koi doctor hi nahin tha
 Anemia is an iron deficiency disease in the body and India is on top in the world in terms of anemia in women and children

 Even after this, the CAG found in the primary centers of all states that iron tablets were not being given

 It was found in the audit that a decrease of 3 to 75 per cent was found in all 28 states i

 Due to lack of space in this hospital, lab work was also going on in the waiting area of the patients

 There is no building of 17 Primary Health Centers in Jharkhand

 That is, the disease that needs to be treated, is not happening
 kerala kii 1100 se adhik sieschi or piechasi main sirf 23 main delivery kii suvidha he
 In Bihar, 40 percent of eligible women were not given under Janani Suraksha Yojana
 audit main pataa chalaa ki 15 rajyon ke salanaa acount main bhi kaaphi gadabadiyaan hai
 In the receipts, the expenditure is shown to be low, even the accounts are not kept properly

 The CAG has reviewed the crop insurance scheme between 2011-12 to 2015-16
 jo nattejey saamne aae hai usase yahi lagata he ki yah yojana kisaanon ke liye hote hue bhi unke liye nahin he
 If it was, then why did the CAG have to say that there are insurance schemes for three decades, yet very few farmers have come under their purview
 bahut hi kam chote or seemaant kisaan fasal beemaa ke kawarej main aa sake hai
 There is also a provision for insurance of SC / ST farmers but there is no data for them
 skim unheen kisaanon ke liye he jo kheti ke liye karz lete hai
 Many times the farmers insure the loan of the farm and not the crop
 bank kisaanon ko beemaa praavdhaanon ke bare main nahin bataate hai
 The data of which farmer is insured is neither with the central government nor with the state government
 yahaan tak ki beemaa company eisi bhi nahin rakhti he
 Why is the data holding obligation not added to the guideline
 aajkal digital india or data india kii hi baat hoti he lekin hazaron karodon kii fasal beemaa yojana ke tahat kis kisaan kaa beemaa hua he uskaa koi data hi nahin he
 This facility is for farmers or someone else
 report main kaha gaya he ki fasal kii buvaai kitne aria main hui or beemaa kitne aria kaa hua donon main antar dekha gaya he maharashtra ke ek taluka main 2015 ke kharif sizan main 51,397 hectare zamin main dhan kii buvaai hui jabaki beemaa cover kaa aria dikhaaya gaya 1,11,615 hectare, buvaai se bhi dugana
 The CAG believes that there is a possibility of taking double insurance
 iske liye bid zile kii teen talukaaon ke bank record ko palata gaya
 It was found that farmers got insurance for the same crop two or three times
 sieji kaa kahana he ki rajya sarkaron ke die gaye data par bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 There is no effective mechanism for monitoring the scheme
 jab nigaraanee nahin he, data he nahin or jo he usamen antar he to phir bachaa kya
 Is it possible to say that there may be a lot of rigging
 agar beemaa kii raashi se kam daawa liya gaya to bachi hui raashi kaa kya hoga isaki koi guidelaan nahin he
 During 2011-16, AIC released Rs 3,622 crore to 10 insurance companies
 iske liye guideline kii sharton kii parvaah bhi nahin kii gai or kaaran bataane main asafal rahi
 AIC did not ensure that banks would have to give a Utilization Certificate
 ye us skim kii haalat he jiske naam ke aage pradhanmantri judaa hua he or desh kii raajnneeti jisase din raat prabhavit hoti rahati he
 Under the crop insurance scheme, the government subsidizes premiums to several thousand crore private insurance companies
 privet companiyaan kisaanon ko de rahi hai yaa nahin isaki jaanch ke liye audit kaa koi praavdhaan hi nahin rakhaa gaya he
 Many times banks also delay in giving data of farmers
 kabhi khaataa number galat nikal jaataa he to kabhi khaataa number galat de diya jaataa he
 Banks report work pressure
 ye sab sieji ne jaanch ke baad apni report main kaha he
 In four districts of Maharashtra, 9 banks withheld the claims of farmers amounting to Rs 72 crore
 ek kooparative bank ne 101 karod ke daawey baant dene kaa certificate bhi de diya jabaki 98 karod branch ke khate main hi pade rahe

 The report said that the difference between how much area has been sown in the crop and how much area has been insured is seen in a taluka of Maharashtra, in the kharif season of 2015, 51,397 hectares of land was sown while the area of insurance cover was shown
 1,11,615 ha, twice the sowing
 sieji kaa maananaa he ki dabl beemaa liye jane kii sambhaavna ke sanket milte hai
 For this, the bank records of three taluks of Beed district were reversed
 pataa chalaa ki kisaanon ko ek hi fasal kaa beemaa do-teen baar mila
 The CAG states that the data given by the state governments cannot be trusted
 yojana kii nigaraanee ke liye koi prabhaavshaalee mechanism nahin he
 When there is no monitoring, there is no data and there is a difference between what is there, then what is left
 kya yahi kahana rah gaya ki ho saktaa he ki bade str par herapheri ho rahi he
 There is no guidance on what will happen to the remaining amount if a claim is taken less than the sum insured
 2011-16 ke dauraan eisi ne 10 beemaa companiyon ko 3,622 karod rupee jari kar diye
 For this, the terms of the guidelines were not taken care of and failed to give reasons
 eisi ne sunishchit nahin kiya ki bainkon ko utilizeshan certificate dena hi hoga
 This is the condition of the scheme in front of which the Prime Minister is attached and the politics of the country which affects day and night
 fasal beemaa yojana ke tahat sarkaar kai hazaar karod privet beemaa companiyon ko premium kii sabsidi detii he
 There is no provision of audit to check whether private companies are giving them to farmers
 kai baar bank bhi kisaanon kaa data dene main deree karte hai
 Sometimes the account number goes wrong, sometimes the account number is given wrong
 bank kaam kaa dabaav bataate hai
 All this is stated by the CAG in its report after investigation
 maharashtra ke chaar zilon main 9 bainkon ne kisaanon ke daavon kaa 72 karod rupaya roak liya
 a cooperative bank also gave a certificate to distribute claims worth 101 crores while 98 crores remained in the account of the branch itself
 bhartiya rail ko modi sarkaar ke kaabil mantriyon main se ek suresh prabhu chalaate hai lekin sieji ne bhartiya rail ke liye tikat booking, paryaton se lekar khan-paan tak kaa zimmaa sanbhaalane vaali IRCTC ke kaam or quality kii jo audit report di he wo kaaphi gambhir he
 One has to think that all this is happening as Suresh Prabhu's Railway Minister, which is considered good, then how is it possible that the Zonal Railways had to make a master plan of catering services in every station and trains but seven Zonal Railways have given this Blue print was not made
 niti bani ki train kii pentry car main gas ke burner nahin honge, sabko electric kiya jayega, iske baavjood integrated coach factory ne april 2011 se march 2016 ke bich alpiji silendar vaali 103 pentry car banaakar zonal railway ko deen
 115 base kitchens were outside the railway premises where there was no quality check facility
 74 steshnon main se 46 main jan aahaar centre hi nahin the jabaki railway board ne zonal railways ko kifayati daamon main khaanaa uplabdh karaane ke liye jan aahaar centre banane ke aadesh die the
 a joint investigation of 74 stations and 80 trains revealed that cleanliness was not maintained in the catering units
 nal ke pani kaa hi istemaal khaane pine ke saamaan main hua
 The dustbin was open and filled with a lot of dirt
 khaane-pine ke saamaan ko mackhiyon, keedon, dhul, chuhon or cockroach vagairah se bachaane ke liye dhak kar nahin rakhaa gaya tha
 Sales of food items in trains and stations are being rigged, bills for food items purchased in mobile units of the train were not being paid
 khaadya saamagree tay maatra se kam di ja rahi thim
 Packaged drinking water of inferior quality was being sold without approval
 ye bhi kaha gaya he ki kai baar khaane kii quality aisi nahin thi ki wo kisi insaan ko di jaae, khaane-pine kaa dooshit yaa expyri date vaala saamaan yatriyon ko diya ja rahaa tha
 The CAG report said that 11 crore surcharge was collected from passengers for superfast rail but some super fast trains continued to be 95 percent late
 ab aate hai jan swasthya par
 The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was started in 2005 for the health of the people of the village to prevent the death of child and mother at birth
 sieji ne 2011 se march 2016 tak kaa hisaab kitaab kiya he
 Poll of this plan is also seen
 27 rajyon ne is mad kaa paisa kharch hi nahin kiya
 This amount was 7,375 crores in 2011-12 which increased to 9509 crores in 2015-16
 6 rajya aise hai jahaan 36
 An amount of 31 crores was put in some other scheme
 jin yojanaon kaa sambandh garib auraton or navjaat se he un yojanaon kaa paisa bhi saat hazaar karod or nau hazaar karod kharch nahin hoga to kya mana jaae
 Do these schemes revolve on paper and return to Delhi or the state capital
 bihar, jharkhand, sikkim, uttarakhand, pashchim bengal main primary health centre, community health centre ab bhi 50% kam hai
 There are hundreds of health centers which are working in dirty conditions
 20 rajyon main 1285 project kaagazon main puure ho chuke hai magar asaliyat main shuru bhi nahin hue hai
 There are 17 states where machines like ultrasound, X-ray, eshiji worth 30 crores are lying
 vahaan medical staff nahin he, rakhane kii jagah tak nahin he
 Don't you think that the public is joking
 27 rajyon ke lagbhag har swasthya centre main 77 se 87 fisadi doctoron kii kami he
 When there is no doctor, then why do governments not make such advertisements that we are planning but are not delivering it? bagair doctor ke liye enarechaem kaa paisa kaise kharch ho rahaa hoga
 There were 67 health centers in 13 states where there were no doctors
 anemia sharir main aayran kii kami kii beemaari he or mahilaon or bacchon main anemia ke maamle main bharat duniya main top par he
 Fifty percent of mothers who die during childbirth die due to anemia
 iske baad bhi sieji ne sabhi rajyon ke praathmik kendron main paaya ki aayran tablet di hi nahin ja rahi hai
 a pregnant woman is required to give one hundred folic acid tablets to the NRHM center
 audit main paaya gaya ki sabhi 28 rajyon main 3 se 75 fisadi kii kami mili yani tablet die hi nahin gaye
 In Arunachal, Jammu Kashmir, Manipur, Meghalaya, 50% of pregnant women could not get tetanus vaccine
 tippaniyan The CAG investigated 3 general hospitals in Gujarat
 nadiad general aspataal main apressant theatre to he lekin oparation ke pehle or baad mariz ko rakhane ke liye kamare nahin hai
 If you take the patient directly to the operation theater, from there to the ward directly, then there is an increased risk of infection
 isi aspataal main jagah kii kami ke kaaran lab kaa kaam bhi marizon ke vatting aria main hi chal rahaa tha
 The General Hospital of Godhra requires 440 beds but due to 210, patients are found on the ground
 jharkhand main 17 primary health centre kii imaarat hi nahin he
 Out of 32 special treatment facilities in 5 district hospitals, only 6 to 14 facilities were available
 yani jitani beemaari kaa ilaaj hona chahie, nahin ho rahaa he
 Kerala has more than 1100 cschis and only 23 delivery facilities at PHC
 bihar main janani suraksha yojana ke tahat 40 fisadi yogya mahilaon ko nahin diye gaye
 It was found in the audit that there are too many errors in the annual accounts of 15 states
 raseedon main, kharchon main kam-zyaada dikhaaya gaya he, hisaab bhi thik se nahin rakhaa gaya he
 In its conclusion, the CAG has written that both the Center and the states have not done satisfactory work in terms of spending money
 sieji kii report se nazaren churaane se koi laabh nahin
 It is better to talk and make the system transparent and try to land on the ground
 sieji kaa kahana he ki rajya sarkaron ke die gaye data par bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 There is no effective mechanism for monitoring the scheme
 jab nigaraanee nahin he, data he nahin or jo he usamen antar he to phir bachaa kya
 Is it possible to say that there may be a lot of rigging
 agar beemaa kii raashi se kam daawa liya gaya to bachi hui raashi kaa kya hoga isaki koi guidelaan nahin he

 2011-16 ke dauraan eisi ne 10 beemaa companiyon ko 3,622 karod rupee jari kar diye
 For this, the terms of the guidelines were not taken care of and failed to give reasons
 eisi ne sunishchit nahin kiya ki bainkon ko utilizeshan certificate dena hi hoga
 This is the condition of the scheme in front of which the Prime Minister is attached and the politics of the country which affects day and night
 fasal beemaa yojana ke tahat sarkaar kai hazaar karod privet beemaa companiyon ko premium kii sabsidi detii he

 This amount was 7,375 crores in 2011-12 which increased to 9509 crores in 2015-16
 6 rajya aise hai jahaan 36
 An amount of 31 crores was put in some other scheme
 jin yojanaon kaa sambandh garib auraton or navjaat se he un yojanaon kaa paisa bhi saat hazaar karod or nau hazaar karod kharch nahin hoga to kya mana jaae
 Do these schemes revolve on paper and return to Delhi or the state capital

 There are hundreds of health centers which are working in dirty conditions

 There are 17 states where machines like ultrasound, X-ray, eshiji worth 30 crores are lying
 vahaan medical staff nahin he, rakhane kii jagah tak nahin he
 Don't you think that the public is joking
 27 rajyon ke lagbhag har swasthya centre main 77 se 87 fisadi doctoron kii kami he
 When there is no doctor, then why do governments not make such advertisements that we are planning but are not delivering it? bagair doctor ke liye enarechaem kaa paisa kaise kharch ho rahaa hoga
 There were 67 health centers in 13 states where there were no doctors

 isi aspataal main jagah kii kami ke kaaran lab kaa kaam bhi marizon ke vatting aria main hi chal rahaa tha
 The General Hospital of Godhra requires 440 beds but due to 210, patients are found on the ground

 Kerala has more than 1100 cschis and only 23 delivery facilities at PHC
 bihar main janani suraksha yojana ke tahat 40 fisadi yogya mahilaon ko nahin diye gaye
 It was found in the audit that there are too many errors in the annual accounts of 15 states
 raseedon main, kharchon main kam-zyaada dikhaaya gaya he, hisaab bhi thik se nahin rakhaa gaya he
 In its conclusion, the CAG has written that both the Center and the states have not done satisfactory work in terms of spending money
 sieji kii report se nazaren churaane se koi laabh nahin
 It is better to talk and make the system transparent and try to land on the ground
 ye us skim kii haalat he jiske naam ke aage pradhanmantri judaa hua he or desh kii raajnneeti jisase din raat prabhavit hoti rahati he
 Under the crop insurance scheme, the government subsidizes premiums to several thousand crore private insurance companies

 In four districts of Maharashtra, 9 banks withheld the claims of farmers amounting to Rs 72 crore

 a study conducted by a research institute has revealed this conclusion
 isamen kaha gaya he ki aam janata ke bich in nivesh yojanaon ko lekar adhik jaankaree nahin he
 Researchers from the Institute for Financial Management and Research (IFMR) conducted this study and the funding has been provided by the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, India Gold Policy Center (IGPC)
 desh ke chaar jilon maharashtra main kolhapur, tamilnadu main coimbatore, pashchim bengal main hughali or uttar pradesh main saharanpur main 1,000 logon ke bich yah adhyayan kiya gaya
 What came out in the study is shocking in a way
 in chaar jilon main jin 1,000 logon se baatcheet kii gai unamem se keval paanch logon ko hi sarkaar kii swarna yojanaon ke bare main jaankaree thi
 The government has launched several investment schemes related to this to reduce the physical demand for gold
 swarna mudrikaran yojana, saawarin gold bond yojana or swarna sikaa yojana jaisi kai yojanayen shuru kii gai hai
 IFMR researcher Misha Sharma said, "we have come to know that there is little or no awareness among the people about these three gold schemes
" ye yojanayen do saal pehle kendra sarkaar ne shuru kii hai
 Only five of the four districts were aware of it
 kya he gold monetigeshan skim ?bhale higold monetiseshanskim kii charchaa chaaron ore ho lekin bahut kam logon ko hi isaki puri jaankaree or phaayde pataa hai
 Under this scheme you can deposit your gold in the bank, instead of which the bank will give you a fixed rate of interest
 yah phaayde kaa sauda isliye he kyonki jab aap loker lekar sona rakhte he to aapako bank ko paise chukaane padate hai lekin isamen ulte bank hi aapako paise degaa
 Minimum 30 grams of gold will have to be deposited According to the guidelines issued by the RBI, the bank will have to keep at least 30 grams of 995 purity gold bank munk, while there is no maximum limit
 isamen gold-baar, sikke, gahane aadi shaamil honge
 Keep in mind that this will not include metal
 bank apane marji se tay karenge byaaj darasabhi vaanijya bainkon ko is skim ko shuru karne kii anumati he
 Along with this, the RBI has also allowed that all banks can fix the interest rates on the gold deposits themselves
 4) jamaa karne se pehle sone kii jaanchis skim main teen tareeke kii samyavadhi main sona jamaa kiya ja sakegaa
 Short term (1 to 3 years), medium term (5 to 7 years) and long term (12 to 15 years)
 iske alaava sone ko jamaa karne se pehle uski shuddhta kii jaanch hogi
 Only then can the work related to submission be carried forward
 paisa yaa sona lene kaa vikalpmeurity period samaapt hone par aap ke yah opshan hoga ki aap yaa to paise len yaa phir apana sona waapas len
 The good thing is that you will be paid according to the price of gold at that time
 jab aap sona jamaa karne jaaenge tab hi aap se puch liya jayega ki aap koun sa vikalp chunane ja rahe hai
 Be aware that you cannot change this later

 Rahul Gandhi is in a defiant mode
 ve silent mod yaa anmane mod se nikal aae hai
 Allegations may be high, but Rahul Gandhi never directly challenged in this way, but this time what has happened that he is playing from the front foot
 kya bijepi netaa subrahmanyam swami ne koi kamazor gend daal di he
 On 16 November, Swamy alleged that Rahul Gandhi showed himself to be a British citizen in the documents he submitted to start a company backops Ltd in the UK
 swami ne kaha ki unhone 12 november ko pradhanmantri modi ko patr likhakar maang kii he ki rahul gandhi kii bhartiya naagarikta radd kii jaae
 Swamy said that he would demand the Lok Sabha speaker to form a committee to investigate it and cancel his membership if found to be right
 rahul ke is company main 65 pratishat share hai
 Swamy said that Rahul has given Britain's address
 2003 or 2006 ke ritern main bhi british naagarik likhaa hua he
 Therefore, there can be no mistake twice
 congress kaa jawaab tha ki document aplod karte samay galati se british naagarikta tip ho gaya he jise thik kiya ja saktaa he
 Rahul Gandhi's citizenship is Indian only
 indian express akhbaar kii report ke anusaar kuch record main british naagarik likhaa he
 Some records of the same company have an Indian citizen written on it
 ek or record miltaa he jisamen haath se british ko kaat kar bhartiya naagarik likhaa gaya he
 When Rahul Gandhi contested the Lok Sabha elections in 2004, the company has been mentioned in his affidavit
 express likhata he ki company ke mul dastavej main bhartiya naagarik hi likhaa he
 This document has been filed by Rahul Gandhi's agent Damian Wardingley
 is baat ko lekar rahul gandhi ne pradhanmantri ko chunauti di he ki jaanch agency aapaki he
 You do bijepi ke netaa shahanwaaz hossain ne kaha he ki 2ji se lekar har maamle kii jaanch ho rahi he
 But Foreign Ministry spokesman Vikas Swaroop has said on Thursday that the foreign ministry has not received any instructions related to the investigation
 subrahmanyam swami ne ahmedabad main yahaan tak kah diya ki ho saktaa he ki rahul ke paas turki kii naagarikta bhi ho, main unki turki or duusare deshon kii naagarikta ke bare main jaanch karuunga
 Swamy also said that the mother and son have assets worth Rs 2
5 lakh crore
 jo bharat ko iskar se milane vaale rajasav se bhi zyada he
 Fifteen lakh crores deposited abroad is not known, but if Sonia Rahul has two and a half lakh crores, then it should be brought to Swami first by bringing it immediately and then start giving Jan Dhan account holders
 turki kii naagarikta se lekar dhai lakh karod tak ke aarope
 But on one of his charges, the ED has filed an FIR in the National Herald case
 tippaniyan Will the BJP accept the challenge of Rahul Gandhi or will the session of Parliament fall prey to this issue
 ahmedabad main swami ne vitt mantri arun jetali par bhi aarope lagaae
 i said that i had told the central government six steps to bring black money from outside, but the way the finance minister is adopting, black money will never come back
 swami rahul par hi nahin jetali par bhi aarope laga rahe hai
 Does Swami not know that SIT has been formed to find out black money, which is working under the supervision of Supreme Court
 15 agast ko pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki aghoshit kaala dhan kii raashi 6500 karod hi bataai thi
 In Bihar elections, Nitish Kumar targeted the Prime Minister so much on black money, but even then the Prime Minister did not talk about two and a half million crores
 kya swami ke paas apni koi jaanch agency he jo supreme court kii esaiti or sarkaar ke vitt mantri se zyada jaankaree rakhti he
 Defending these allegations, is the BJP able to see that one edge of Swami's sword is cutting them as well
 rahul gandhi ne aresas ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya
 They are constantly targeting the RSS
 kaha ki ek taraf aresas ke log
 On the other hand people of Seemi
 ladaai karavaate hai, hindustaniyon ko daraate hai
 And in between, Congress party works
 kya rahul aresas se vaicharik or sanghathan ke str par ladane kii taiyaari main hai yaa sirf bayaan he

 They are constantly targeting the RSS

 And in between, Congress party works
 kya rahul aresas se vaicharik or sanghathan ke str par ladane kii taiyaari main hai yaa sirf bayaan he
 According to the report of the Indian Express newspaper, a British citizen is written in some records
 usee company ke kuch record main bhartiya naagarik likhaa gaya he
 Another record is found in which an Indian citizen has been written by cutting the British by hand
 2004 main jab rahul gandhi ne loksabhaa chunaav ladaa tha tab apane halafname main is company kaa zikr kiya he
 Express writes that only the Indian citizen is written in the original document of the company
 is dastauez ko rahul gandhi ke agent demian vardingle ne file kiya he
 On this matter, Rahul Gandhi has challenged the Prime Minister that the investigating agency is yours
 aap kijiye
 BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain has said that every case from 2G is being investigated
 lekin videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa vikaas swaroop ne guuruuvaar ko hi kaha he ki videsh mantralay ke paas jaanch se sambandhit koi nirdesh nahin aayaa he
 Subrahmanyam Swamy even said in Ahmedabad that maybe Rahul also has Turkish citizenship, i will check his citizenship of Turkey and other countries
 swami ne yah bhi kaha ki maa bete ke paas dhai lakh karod kii sampatti he
 Which is more than the revenue that India gets from income tax
 videshon main jamaa pandrah lakh karod kaa pataa nahin lekin agar sonia rahul ke paas dhai lakh karod hai to ise turant laakar sabase pehle swami ko dena chahie or uske baad jandhan khaataa dharakon ko dena shuru karnaa chahie
 Allegations ranging from Turkish citizenship to 2
5 lakh crores
 par unheen ke ek aarope par neshnal herald maamle main idi ne praathmiki darj kii he
 The comments kya bijepi rahul gandhi kii chunauti sweekaar karegi yaa phir sansad kaa satr is mudde kii bhent chadh jayega
 In Ahmedabad, Swamy also accused Finance Minister Arun Jaitley
 kaha ki maine centre sarkaar ko baahar se kaala dhan laane ke chah kadam bataaye the lekin jis tarah kaa rasta vitt mantri apana rahe hai usase kaala dhan kabhi waapas nahin aane vaala
 Not only is Swami Rahul accusing Jaitley as well
 kya swami ko pataa nahin ki kaala dhan kaa pataa lagane ke liye esaiti bani he jo supreme court kii nigaraanee main kaam kar rahi he
 On 15 August, the Prime Minister said that the amount of undisclosed black money was 6500 crores
 bihar chunaavon main nitish kumaar ne kaala dhan ko lekar pradhanmantri par itnaa nishaanaa saadhaa lekin tab bhi pradhanmantri ne dhai lakh karod vaali baat nahin kii
 Does Swamy have any investigating agency that has more information than the SIT of the Supreme Court and the Finance Minister of the government
 unke in aaropon ko bachaav karte hue bijepi kya yah dekh paa rahi he ki swami kii talwaar kii ek dhar unhen bhi kaat rahi he
 Rahul Gandhi also targeted the RSS
 ve lagaataar aresas par nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 Said that the people of RSS on one side
 duusari taraf simi ke log
 They fight, scare the Indians
 or bich main congress party jodne kaa kaam karti he
 Is Rahul preparing to fight the RSS at ideological and organization level or just a statement
 is baat ko lekar rahul gandhi ne pradhanmantri ko chunauti di he ki jaanch agency aapaki he

 asaram baapu ke liye guuruuvaar kaa din musiibat bharaa sabit ho saktaa he
 Asaram can now be arrested at any time in a minor rape case
 asaram baapu par lagi tamaam dharaaen bhi gaiyr jamaanti hai, jis vajah se unka giraftaar hona tay mana ja rahaa he
 The Delhi Police team has reached Jodhpur to investigate the matter
 jodhpur police ne bhi asaram baapu ke ashram ko sil kar diya he or jaanch ke liye team bhi bana di he
 The sword of arrest is hanging on Asaram Bapu, who has blown the grave charges into the air
 isbaar naaballig se rape or chhedchhad kaa sangeen maamla asaram baapu ke khilaaf darj hua he
 According to the report lodged at the Kamla Market Police Station in Delhi, Asaram not only sexually abused a minor girl in his ashram in Jodhpur, but even threatened to kill her if she told anyone or opened her mouth
 dilli police ne asaram baapu ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara-376 yani rape, dhara-354 yani chhedchhad, 506-yani jaan se maarane kii koshish or protection of children from sexual offenses act yani posco kii dhaaraon ke tahat maamla darj kiya he
 The sections against Asaram Bapu are non-bailable, so it is believed that this time Asaram's arrest is difficult to avoid
 kya he puraa maamla
 
 
 a sixteen-year-old minor girl was studying in class 12 at Asaram's Gurukul in Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh
 ladki ne jo report darj karai he, uske mutabik agast ke pehle hafte main ladki kii tabiyat bighad gai, tab wo chhindwara ke gurukul main hi thi
 Asaram Bapu called Jodhpur to cure the girl with tantra
 ladki ke aaropon ke mutabik jodhpur main uske saath balaatkaar hua
 The girl alleges that Asaram Bapu and another of his companions raped her
 asaram baapu par kanoon kaa shikanja kas gaya he
 The case is about the sexual exploitation of a minor, so the arrest of Asaram Bapu is being considered as fixed, to see how long and how Asaram Bapu survives

 Apart from him, Congress MLA and OBC leader Alpesh Thakore and Independent MLA from Gujarat Jignesh Mevani will also attend this conference

 uttar pradesh ke ek ipies afasar ne licency asalhadhariyon ke bare main sansanikhej khulaasa kiya he
 Amit Pathak, the SSP of Agra, has revealed in an intelligence report sent to the state police chief OP Singh that crores of cartridges of most licensed goods are missing, which are being black-marketed in Bihar and Jharkhand
 ye kaartoos vahaan se aane vaale avaidh asalhon ke badale supplai kiye ja rahe hai
 In this case, ADG (law and Order) PV Ramasastri said that the former SSP of Agra has sent a report regarding verification of cartridges to DGP headquarters
 iskaa adhyayan krime wing se karaayaa ja rahaa he
 The report contains several notable facts
 jald hi is sambandh main jilon ke adhikariyon ko nirdesh jari kiye jaaenge, jisase kaartuson kii kalabazari roki ja sake
 It has also been suspected in the investigation that most of the cartridges sent through black marketing are criminally used illegally
 avaidh tareeke se hasil kiye gaye in kaartuson kii khapat upi main bhi kam nahin he
 It is worth noting that the highest number of incidents of murder by illegal facts are in UP itself
 aankadon ke mutabik, upi main har saal lagbhag 1500 hatyaein goli markar kii jaati hai, jinamein se das pratishat maamalon ko chhodkar baaki maamalon main istemaal kiye jane vaale kaartoos avaidh hi hote hai
 In most cases only illegal materials are used
 in asalhon main istemaal hone vaala kaartoos vaid asalhadhariyon or dukandaaron kii mileebhagat se hasil kiye jate hai
 Bihar and Jharkhand also have 800 to 1000 incidents of shot-to-kill each year, while in other states the number is not even 100
 report ke mutabik, pichley loksabhaa chunaav main pradesh main avaidh shastr banane kii 240 factory pakadi gai thim
 During the election, 10 thousand 575 illegal goods were also seized
 jaahir he in asalhon ke liye kaartoos kii bhi jarurat hoti he, jiskaa nirmaan is paimaane par kiya janaa sambhav nahin he
 These cartridges can be obtained from black marketing only
 avaidh kaartoos hasil karne ke liye upi ek bada bazaar he, jahaan lakhon kii sankhya main asalhon ke license jari kiye gaye hai
 But cartridges with facts are rarely audited
 grih vibhaag ke aankadon kii maane to pradesh main asalha or iskaa license rakhana states simbel mana jaataa he
 12 here
 78 lakh logon ke paas asalhe kaa license he
 The capital city of Lucknow has a population of about 45 lakhs and the maximum number of 53,033 people is licensed in real terms
 yani har 85wein vyakti ke paas asalhe kaa license he
 Jammu and Kashmir is at number two
 vahaan aatankwaad kii vajah se asalhon ke license aasaani se hasil ho jate hai
 Despite this, the number of licensees there is 3
 69 lakh he
 In Punjab too, the licenses of most realities have been given for internal terrorism
 vahaan 3
 59 lakh people have licenses for goods
 nae niyamon ke mutabik upi main ek asalhadhari ek saal main adhiktam 200 kaartoos kharid saktaa he
 Also can hold 100 cartridges simultaneously
 pehle yah sankhya kaaphi kam thi
 To get a new cartridge, 80 percent of the cartridge used has to be stored

 It was said to make provision for numbering on cartridges, but it could not be implemented at the governance level
 agar yah praavdhaan lagu kar diya jaae to hatya kii ghatnaon main kaaphi kami aegi
 Also, the cartridge kiosks used in the assassination will be easy to ascertain to which real estate holder it was given

 us baatcheet ke pramukh anshamujhe ek nakaaratmak note ke saath is baatcheet ko shuru karne kii anumati den
 India's Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj recently said in the United Nations General Assembly that the United Nations is on its way to becoming a League of Nations — it is being defunct
 sanyukt raashtra ko adhik praasangik banane ke liye aap kya kar rahe hai?main nahin kahuunga ki yah niskriy ho rahaa he lekin yah sach he ki hamen ek badi chunauti kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 We are in a phase where the problems are of global scale but at the same time we need multilateral solutions and international cooperation
 aaj, deshon ko le lijie, saarvajanik raay ko dekh lijie
 What is the perception of people - it is better to do it alone or it is better than cooperation
 jaahir he, sanyukt raashtra ke saamne yah ek badi chunauti he
 The United Nations has been able to improve itself
 ab jarurat zyada prabhavi hone kii he, duniya ke logon kii jaruraton or aakankshaon ke anuroop kaary main zyada sakasham banane kii he
 There are many reforms in the field of peace and security that i have been trying to make the United Nations involved in prevention, conflict resolution and peace
 yah vishesh rup se un deshon ke liye he jo sangharsh ke daur se baahar aa gaye hai or unhen shanti behaal rakhane main sakasham banaaya ja sake
 We are also making efforts to reform various bodies of the United Nations and its main aspect is to reform the Security Council
 bharat ek dashak se sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main sthaayee sadsyta kii maang kar rahaa he lekin is disha main baat kuch khaas aage nahin bad pai he
 What is hindering it? The Security Council that exists today represents the geopolitical situation which was at the end of World War II
 tab se lekar ab tak duniya naatakeey rup se badal gai he
 The Council does not conform to the realities of today's world and is unable to address the challenges
 yah spasht he ki sudhaar ke ek pahalu sthaayee sadasyon kii sankhya main vruddhi hogi
 No one can deny the logic of India's candidature
 aapke paas 1
 Has a population of 3 billion
 aap vaishvik aarthik powerhouse ban rahe hai
 You are one of the largest groups of peacekeepers protecting civilians in different parts of the world and are deeply involved in all central activities of the United Nations on all issues including climate change
 iske saath hi, aap ek jeevant loktantr hai
 Therefore, people have no say in that India is not eligible for the Security Council
 samasya yah he ki suraksha parishad kii sanrachana or ruparekha main badlaav ke liye hamen parishad ke paanch sthaayee sadasyon se paanchon kaa sakaaratmak vot chahie
 There is no possibility of this at the moment
 aapako lagata he ki yah kabhi sambhav ho paaegaa?mujhe lagata he ki vah samay aayega jab log vaastaviktaa or sanrachana ke bich ke vilgau ko samajhenge
 The disappointment of so many people around the world will make this change possible
 bharat kii mukhya chintaaon main se ek he aatankwaad or pakistan ko aatankwaadiyon or aatanki hamalon ke garh ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Yet the United Nations did nothing to stop Pakistan from doing so
 sabase pehle main aapako bataanaa chaahunga ki hamane ek aatankwaad virdohi karyaalay banaaya he or aatankwaad virdohi abhiyaanon kii sahaayta ke liye vibhinn deshon ke saath sahyog badhaayaa he
 We have developed a very important program to fight violent extremism and fundamentalism, and this applies to all countries of the world
 ham sirf kisi ek khaas desh kii baat nahin kar rahe hai
 We are making it clear to all countries that terrorism cannot be justified in any way
 aise koi rajnatik kaaran nahin hai jo ise uchit tehra saken, aisa koi kaaran, koi pareshaani nahin he jiske aadhaar par aatankwaad ko jaij tehraaya jaae
 Has the UN recently taken any concrete action against Pakistan? We are negotiating with Pakistan and many other countries and we feel that to create an atmosphere of dialogue with these countries it is necessary that they themselves Let us understand that it is necessary to eliminate such a thing as terrorism
 bharat kii chintaa yah he ki sanyukt raashtra se aatankwaadi ghoshit hafiz said pakistan main aaraam se gum rahaa he or haal hi main, china ne jaish pramukh masood azhar ko aatankwaadi ghoshit karne ke sanyukt raashtra ke prayaason ko avaruddh kar diya
 The UN seems to be ineffective
 sachaai yah he ki agar ham kisi sanghathan ko aatankwaadi ghoshit kar dete hai to iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki sadsy rajya us aadesh ko lagu karne se sambandhit sabhi upaay karenge hi
 One of the problems of the Security Council is that it has veto and they prevent us from taking actions to ensure compliance with sanctions
 bharat 1996 se antarrashtriya aatankwaad par ek vyapak sammelan kaa prastaav de rahaa he
 Even after 22 years, there has been no progress on this
 sanyukt raashtra isse kyon hichak rahaa he?agar is vishay par koi sammelan nahin bulaayaa gaya to iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki aatankwaad se ladane ke liye koi kanoonee jariya hi nahin he
 Many partial aspects have been covered that allow the international community to fight terror, but it is also true that we did not have any comprehensive conference against terrorism
 pareshaani yah he ki aatankwaad kii paribhaasha ko lekar sadsy deshon main koi aam sahmati nahin he
 Without consensus, the Convention on Terrorism is very difficult
 lekin main haar nahin maanoonga
 This is an area that is included in my priorities
 kya kashmir mudde par koi shanti yojana he?mere paas ekmaatr cheez he vah he, mahasachiv kaa rasookh
 i do not have any hard power, i only have soft power and in some circumstances very soft power
 rasookh kaa istemaal karne ke liye hamen sabhi sambandhit pakshon ke bich ek samjhaute kii aavashyaktaa he
 If that is not the agreement, then we can only appeal for a solution
 sanyukt raashtra sidhe samaadhaan main shaamil nahin he
 You have said that India can play the role of a mediator in international affairs? India is a country which has no direct interest in some areas of global conflict
 sangharshrat deshon yaa suraksha sankaton kaa saamana kar rahe deshon ke saath iske bahut achche sambandh hai or meraa maananaa he ki bhartiya kootneeti ko bahut phayda mila he
 India is a bridge-maker, honest intermediary and peacemaker
 rohingya sharnaarthi mudde par bharat ne rohingya ke liye daravaaje band kar die hai kyonki sarkaar unhen desh kii suraksha ke liye khatra maanati he
 What are your views on India's vision? There are already thousands of Rohingyas in India
 bharat bahut hi mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he kyonki yah bangladesh or myanmar kaa mitra he or yah samasya ko prabhavi dhang se sulajhane ke halaat paidaa kar saktaa he
 Myanmar also needs to invest extensively in physical reconstruction and reconcile with the Rohingyas and bring them back
 bharat ko laapata hone vaale rohingyaon par najar rakhni chahie or sharnaarthiyon ko waapas nahin bhejnaa chahie jahaan unhen utpeeda kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 What should India do on situations like the Paris Climate Change Agreement where America has come out of it? First, it is clear that even though the US government has separated itself from it, American society is still with it
 ham america ke nagarikon, vyavsaayon, rajyon main paris samjhaute kii patibaddhtaon ke liye puraa samarthan najar aa rahaa he
 But at the same time, it is also true that globally we are seeing that some countries are moving very slowly and this poses a risk of us losing the race
 jalwaayu parivartan kii gati, is par niyantran ke prayaason kii tulana main kahin tej he
 In my opinion, India can play a major role in this
 bharat is sambandh main world leader ho saktaa he
 Allow me to ask a personal question
 aapaki patni kaa janm goa main hua tha
 Has it made any difference in your attitude towards India? i have spent five holidays in India and traveled all over the country
 maine yah mahasoos kiya ki bharat ko puri tarah jaananaa-samajhnaa bahut kathin he
 i believe that my personal love for India, its civilization, its culture, has developed
 aap aaj keval duniya ke stambhon main se ek nahin hai balki saarvbhaumik sabhyataa ke stambh hai
 This is an achievement you can be very proud of

 The Adivasi society's allegation is that the Adivasi society alleges that the gram sabha that the government is talking about to start the project by taking permission (pesa-provisions of the Panchayat, Extension to Pseudules Arias) for mining is a lie
 hiloli gram sabha ke logon kaa kahana he ki hamase kisi ne bhi raishumaari nahin kii he

 Who was the real robber of the mountain? State Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, while examining the heat of the agitation in June, said at that time, "even though the state government's NCL company has given the contract of mining to Adani, but the start of this mining project It was during the BJP era
 2015 main jab pehali baar narendra modi chhattisgarh pahunche tabhi is project ko anaapatti certificate die gaye

 They fear that they may be labeled as anti-bjp and anti-national

 But it is believed that the BJP is gradually implementing the RSS agenda

 a leader of Nagpur's school union told the newspaper, BJP is moving ahead on the agenda of saffronisation

 What made the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh after 15 years, the pension to MISA prisoners has been seen as wasteful
 lihaaja sarkaar misabandi pension ko band karne par amaadaa ho gai he
 The Congress says that the Measabandi pension should be stopped, but the BJP is strongly opposed to it
 bijepi ne iske khilaaf virodh pradarshan kii bhi chetavanee di he

 After forming the government in the state, the Congress is looking to discontinue this pension started by the BJP government
 congresspravaktaa shobhaa ojha ne maang kii ki misabandi pension band honi chahie

 Tapan Bhowmik has himself been a Misabandi and is currently the President of the Democracy Fighter Association
 apatkaal ke dauraan ye bhopal jail main band rahe
 They call it the Samman Nidhi, not the Misabandi pension
 unka kahana he ki jab bharat ratna waapas nahin ho saktaa he, to misabandi sammaan nidhi kaise band hogi
 He said that if the Misabandi pension was discontinued, we would go to court
 misabandiyon ko loktantr senaniyon kaa darja dene vaali bijepi ne congress ko khuleam chetavanee di he
 BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agarwal said that if the Measabandi Samman Nidhi is closed, the Congress will play brick by brick

 In such a situation, it remains to be seen whether a government formed with support from others can succeed in this or not

 On Wednesday, it was informed in the Lok Sabha that out of 43 names suggested by the Supreme Court Collegium for appointment of judges, the recommendation for 37 names has been sent back to the Central Government
 centre sarkaar ne 43 naamon ko supreme court ke paas punarvichaar ke liye bheja tha
 The collegium has deferred the proposal of 3 names, 3 names are still under consideration of the collegium
 supreme courtne 18 november ko sarkaar ko jaankaree di thi ki wo un sabhi 43 naamon par apni sifarish par kaayam hai jinhen sarkaar ne colegium ke paas dobaaraa vichaar ke liye bhej diya tha
 Then the bench of Chief Justice TS Thakur and Justice AR Dave had said- 'we have reiterated the recommendation of 43 names for appointment of judges in the High Court which were rejected by the Government and sent for reconsideration
 'teen naam ko kiya gaya khaarijlekin kanoon rajya mantri pi pi choudhary ne buudhvaar ko loksabhaa main likhit jawaab main bataaya ki colegium ne sirf 37 naamon kii sifarish dobaaraa centre ke paas bheji he
 Chaudhary said in response, "the Supreme Court Collegium had sent proposals for 77 names, out of which the government appointed 34 judges to various High Courts
 sarkaar ne 43 naam colegium ke paas punarvichaar ke liye bheje
 Proposals for three names have been postponed, three names still with the Supreme Court
 'centre ne 15 november ko supreme court ko bataaya tha ki hoicourt main jajon kii niyukti ke liye colegium kii ore se bheje gaye 77 naamon main se 34 ko manjuuri de di he
 The government had also told the Supreme Court that no file is pending with it on the recommendations of the appointment of judges

 " Kanhaiya Kumar, former president of JNU, who has taken a new step in active politics, has made the battle of Begusarai in Bihar a war of power versus youth
 bihar kii yah ek aisi seat he jahaan mahagathbandhan main daraaren dikhne lageen, jab communist party of india yani sipiai ne kanhaiya kumaar ko apana pratyaashee bana diya
 NDA candidates and Union Minister Giriraj are also upset and the Grand Alliance candidates are also unhappy
 giriraaj singh begusarai se chunaav nahin ladanaa chaahate the or apni puraani navada seat par waapas lautnaa chaahate the
 He had also expressed his displeasure to the high command but Amit Shah understood and extinguished him
 haalanki kanhaiya ne kendriya mantri ke is rukh kaa khub majaak udaaya
 In a post written on Facebook, Kanhaiya said that Giriraj's behavior is like a child who is adamant about not going to school due to lack of homework
 tivi par news dekhakar pataa laga ki logon ko free main pakistan bhejne vaala begusarai chunaav ladane tak aane ko taiyaar nahin he
 For Giriraj Singh, this seat is such that it is neither swallowing nor being puffed up
 giriraaj kii chintaa thodi kam hogi kyonki argedy ke ummidavaar tanwir hasan ke utarane ke baad muqabla trikoniya ho gaya he
 At the same time, Giriraj is also worried that now Bhumihar votes will be divided from Kanhaiya's entry, on which he had depended till now
 kanhaiya ke maidan main aane ke pehle itihaas or jati sameekaran giriraaj ke saath the
 Among the 19 lakh voters of the ethnic mathematician Begusarai, the number of upper caste Bhumihars is about 19 percent, while the second number is Muslims with 15 percent voters
 12 fisadi yadav hai or 7 fisadi kurmi voter he
 After getting along with Nitish's party, BJP was confident that it would capture around 37 per cent of the votes
 ( bhoomihaar 19%+ oonchi jati 11%+ kurmi 7%)argedy ko bhi puraa bharosa tha ki jeet ke wo bhi kareeb hai or kareeb 35 fisadi vot unhen bhi mil sakate hai
 (muslim 15% + Yadav 12% + Dalit 8%)
 donon guton ko is baat kaa bharosa tha ki 22% anya jatiyon khaas taur par mahadaliton kaa vot agar unhen mil jaataa to jeet pakki ho jaati
 History is a small example of how Bhumihar has been prevalent in the history of Begusarai, that in the Lok Sabha 9 times out of the last 10, only one Bhumihar was elected as an MP
 kanhaiya kii entry ne donon gathbandhanon ke plan ko matiamet kar diya he, khaastaur par nuksaan giriraaj ko hoga kyonki donon ek hi jati se taalluk rakhte hai
 If Kumar manages to win the votes of Bhumihars, then RJD candidate Tanvir Hasan will directly benefit from it
 lekin argedy ke liye bhi ye aasaan nahin he
 Begusarai was once considered the industrial capital of Bihar
 kal kaarkaanon kii maujuudagi ke chalate vahaan ke rajnatik paridshya main trade unionon kaa bahut mahatv tha or wo kaaphi prabhaavshaalee the, vamadalon kii is ilaake main acchhee paith he
 However, due to decades of poor governance, closed factories, the condition of the Left parties became weaker
 aakhri baar sipiai ne yahaan 1967 main jeet darj kii thi
 Despite the defeat, the CPI always remained in the match, finishing second or third place 3 times since 1967
 2009 main bhi sipiai kaa ummidavaar duusare sthaan par tha
 In the 2014 election, he got 2 lakh votes in the furious Modi wave
 2004 or 2009 main yahaan se jediu jiti jo us vakt endie kaa hissaa thi lekin 2014 main wo endie se alag ho gai or bijepi ne ye seat unase chin lee
 This time Kanhaiya Kumar can become the face of some Bhumihars, Dalits and Mahadalits
 bhoomiharon ke bich apni paith banane ke liye kanhaiya kumaar ye lagaataar hawa banane kii koshish main lage hai ki ye muqabla giriraaj banaam kanhaiya he
 RJD candidate Tanvir Hasan is also touting that it is not Kanhaiya vs Giriraj but Giriraj is facing RJD
 giriraaj kaa dukhagiriraaj begusarai seat par nahin ladanaa chaahate the, bihar se unke mantrimandal ke sabhi saathiyon radha mohan singh, aarake singh, ramkripal yadav or ashvini choube ko unke apni siton se hi tikat mil gaya lekin giriraaj apana tikat kaatane se thode aahat hue
 Five years ago, Bhola Singh of BJP won the Begusarai seat for the first time
 unhone tanwir hasan ko 5 fisadi voton se haraaya tha haalanki tanwir hasan or sipiai ke ummidavaar rajendra prasad ke bich 16 fisadi kaa antar tha
 Lalu refused to give Kanhaiya a seat in the Grand Alliance of Bihar after the RJD shied away from Kanhaiya
 sipiai kanhaiya ke liye tikat maangati rahi lekin tejasvi ne aisa hone nahin diya
 Tejashwi does not want the CPI to once again register its presence in Bihar as most of the party's votes will be cut from the RJD account
 doosraa tejasvi nahin chaahate ki bihar se koi kaabil vaktaa rashtriya patal par chamake or bhavishya main unase muqabla kare

 # The world's largest Internet company, Google, has been accused of keeping Internet users in the dark and allowing it to fall prey to the dreaded virus heartblock
 australia ke akhbaar sidney morning herold ne yah khabar di he
 Experts associated with IT security believe that Google is selfish and thought of itself by ignoring the interests of Internet users around the world
 usne sahi samay par unhen khatarnaak virus hartblid ke bare main nahin bataaya jisane lakhon internet yujar ke khate hack karvaa die
 Google is facing allegations that it has only told its customers about the virus
 hartblid ek khatarnaak virus he or yah open sorce project main tha jiske software main baari truti thi
 Google found out about this in March itself, but it kept silence, which had to bear the brunt of millions of users
 security exparts kaa kahana he ki google open sorce encripshan karne vaale software open SSL ke bare main jaankaree hote hue bhi chuppi saadhe rakhi
 It was a dangerous virus in its software itself and used to encrypt five million website internet traffic around the world
 unamem se kaiyon ne kaha ki google ne chuninda companiyon ko is virus ke bare main jaankaree de di
 Internet security experts are very angry with this
 is virus ke kaaran duniya bhar main lakhon online khaaton par asar pad gaya or unki suraksha main send lag gai
 Terror spread all over the world as soon as the news of this virus was detected
 kai bade websiton ne iske khilaaf morchabandi kar to lee lekin ab tak unhone apane yugers ko password phir se set karne ko nahin kaha he
 Security experts say that they should change the password immediately as there is a risk of hacking
 google ne yah baat yahuu, amejan, twitor vagairah ko nahin bataai jisase un sabhi par hekking kaa khatra mandaraane laga

 In a befitting reply to the critics who advised him to retire, the legendary Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar said, "my critics did not teach me cricket
 ’haal main100 antarrashtriya shatakajamaane kaa vishwa ricard apane naam karne vaale master ballebaaj kaa maananaa he ki jis din unhen lagegaa ki bharat ke liye ballebaaji karne ke liye jate samay unke andar ‘cricket ke prati junun’ kam ho rahaa he to ‘main kicket chhod duungaa
 'and' my critics will not need to say this (advice to retire)
 ’tendulkar ne kaha ki ve cricket khelte hai kyonki unhen yah acha lagata he
 There is nothing better than playing for India
 ek patrika ko diye intervyuu main tendulkar ne kaha, ‘aaj bhi jab main apane saathiyon ke saath rashtriya gaan ke liye khadaa hota hum to ab bhi mere rongte khadey ho jate hai
 'they said,' They (critics) can raise many questions but they cannot answer the questions raised on their own because none of them will understand my condition and it is impossible that they know that i What i'm thinking and how i'm feeling ’tendulkar se yah poochne par ki 100waan shatak banane kii baadha paar karne kaa samay kathin tha to unhone kaha, ‘isamen koi shaq nahin ki yah kathin samay tha
 The 100th century was hard to make, but i myself don't know why it was
 ’unhone kaha, ‘shaayad isaliye ki yah mahashatak ek rashtriya junun main badal chukaa tha or shaayad isaliye ki main 100wein antarrashtriya shatak kii charchaaon se nahin batch paa rahaa tha jo kahin mere avchetan man par asar daal rahi ho yaa phir yah bhi ho saktaa he ki bhagwaan mujhe kathin prayaas karana chaah rahaa ho
 When asked whether he ever came to mind after retiring from the One Day after winning the World Cup last year, Tendulkar replied, 'such a thing never came to my mind
 ’tendulkar ne kaha, ‘mere anek doston ne bhi yah poocha ki vishwa cap jeetne ke baad maine sanyas kyon nahin liya
 Maybe they are right
 vah samay bhi sahi tha vishwa cap jeetne ke baad sabhi utsahit the or van de cricket chhodane kaa isse acha samay or kya ho saktaa tha lekin sachhee baat kahuun to mere man main sanyas lene kaa vichaar kabhi aayaa hi nahin
 He said, 'the World Cup was a victory for the whole country and i had no right to use it for myself (announcement of retirement)
 meraa sanyas itnaa mahatvapurn nahin tha
 If i had announced my retirement, all the attention would have shifted from the World Cup title win to my retirement and i am not so selfish as India won the World Cup
 ’tendulkar ne kaha ki vah ab bhi cricket kaa lutf uthaa rahe hai or sanyas ke bare main abhi soch bhi nahin rahe hai
 He said, 'I am enjoying playing cricket and will keep playing as long as i feel good
 mujhe apane sanyas kii baat media se chupaane koi jarurat nahin he
 They (media) have been with me for 25 years, will tell media for sure
 philhal sanyas ke bare main soch bhi nahin rahaa hum
 'this great batsman said,' i always want to be good and always strive to excel, but i feel both honored and ashamed together if you (media) people like 'the Greatest' 
 ’ tendulkar ne kaha, ‘sar don breadman or gairi sobers do mahaan cricketer hue hai or mere samay ke bryaan lara shen warn jaik kalis riki ponting or rahul dravid sabhi ek se badhkar ek hai
 'he said,' My cricket journey has taught me that no matter how good you are or how participative you have to be ready to grind in times of difficulty
 aapako kathin parishram ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga or lagaataar kathin parishram karte rahanaa hoga
 'sachin, who has been playing cricket for 25 years, says,' There is never a shortcut to success and it is also important to know that passion, commitment and concentration is necessary to chase dreams and i started from the beginning of my career These three basic things have been relied upon

 unki or du plasis kii salaami jodi kisi bhi vipakshi team ko acchhee shuruyaat se vanchit rakh sakati he
 However, Suresh Raina, the most successful batsman in IPL history, has not been able to maintain consistency in his performance
 nichle kram main chennai ke paas dwen braavo jaisaa ballebaaj bhi he, jo teji se ran batorne or bade shot lagane main maahir he
 Apart from batting, Chennai's bowling is also excellent, in which Bravo has also played an important role

 Animal Husbandry, Fisheries, Village Industries and Public Health Engineering Minister Kusum Singh said, 'honorable Chief Minister is absolutely right
 main bhi bilkul durust kah rahi hum
 The question is whether you are a non-vegetarian or a vegetarian
 shaakaahaari hai to aap doodh pijiye
 And if you are a non-vegetarian, then you eat eggs voluntarily, eat fish, what do you mind? 'unhone kaha, 'abhi hamaare yahaan andon kaa utpaadan zyada nahin he, lekin jab unka utpaadan badhegaa, to ham vikalp rakhenge ki jo bachche maansaahaari pariwaron se aate hai, jinke mata-pita ijaajat dete hai
 They will be fed eggs
 ise lekar mananeey mukhyamantri or mujhamen koi ‘klesh’ nahin he
 He is also right, i am also right
 jo maansaahaari hai andey khaayen, machhlee khaayen
 What problems does anyone have, brother
 agar nahin hai to mat khao
 If you are vegetarian, then eat milk, kheer, fruits and flowers
 'unase poocha gaya tha ki ek ormukhyamantri andey ke upyog ko hatotsahit kararahe hai, to phir aap logon visheshkar bacchon ko paushtik aahaar ke liye anda or machhlee khaane ke liye protsaahit kyon kar rahi hai
 The Village Industries Minister had called to apprise the process of online sale of marketing of cottage and village industries products in the state
 in utpaadon ko vaishvik bazaar main online uplabdh karaane kii yah vyavastha ek july se aarambh kii ja rahi he
 Significantly, on May 30, a purely vegetarian Chief Minister Chouhan had said in a meeting of state BJP officials, 'milk will be provided to children and pregnant women in anganwadis, not eggs
 ' unka yah aashwaasan us samay aayaa, jab jain samudaay ke ek pratinidhimandal ne unase milakar anganbari kendron ke bhojan se andey ko dur rakhane kaa aagrah kiya tha
 Two days later (june 1), at the state-level fishermen conference held at the Jawaharlal Nehru Agricultural University in Jabalpur in the presence of Chief Minister Chauhan, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Minister Kusum Singh Mahadele asked people to include fish in it to make their children's food nutritious
 Had appealed unhone kaha tha, 'machhlee main acchhee maatra main protein hota he or yah jin ilaakon main pehle se uplabdh he, vahaan kuposhan kii samasya dur karne main sahaayak ho sakati he
 If his request is opposed, i will definitely get the protection of the Chief Minister, because he is like my elder brother

 Kabir Singh is being debated everywhere
 koi nayak se khafa he to koi nayika ke kirdaar par sawaal uthaa rahaa he
 Many people are questioning the portrayal of women in the film and calling it a malevolent film
 magar kuch to aisa he kabir singh main ki aap wo puri film dekhe bina haul se baahar aa nahin sakate
 Talking about the first scene of the film, Kabir Singh's grandmother gives introductions to her grandchildren
 lekin yahaan daadi kuch bhi aisa nahin kahati jisase aapaki najar main wo hero apane kirdaar se jaraa bhi dagamagaa jaae
 Then in the second scene you come across a man who is the hero of the film
 lekin ye kya
 
 
 
 wo hero jismani jarurat ke liye mahilaon kii talash kar rahaa he
 After all the efforts, when the woman is unable to provide for him, he does strange things regardless of the society
 ab in drishyon se darshak apane hero main itani badi khami dekhakar use apane paas se hataakar kuch-kuch grey shed main rangakar thodaa dur rakh dete hai
 Then in the next few scenes, the audience again realizes that Wow, their hero is a very big surgeon
 jo bahut safal he
 They once again try to adopt the old sour sourness
 darshak dow
 Kabir begins to forget Singh's womanizer form
 ab unhen apane hero kaa sens of humar, uskaa dress sens, uske pange, jhagade, himmat sab pasand aa rahaa hota he
 All these qualities of Kabir Singh start connecting the young audience
 apane hero ke zyada gussa karne vaali aadat se chintit bhi ho rahe hai
 In this way, almost an hour of the film goes into the battle of believing that hero and not believing it
 ab agle padaav main hoti he actress kii entry, ye entry us vakt hoti he jab senior resident doctor kabir singh atmasamman se bhare jindadil hero ke rup main darshakon ke kaaphi kareeb aa chukaa he
 The condition is that Kabir, who has become everyone's favorite and famous in the college, has even taken the decision to leave the college due to his self-respect
 magar uskaa dil us safed suut main abhi abhi college ai sidhi-saadi bholi bhali ladki par aa jaataa he
 Here he removes the idea of leaving college from the heart
 ab, ek baar phir darshakon main kabir singh kii wo chhavi dastak detii he, jisamen wo mahilaon ke maamle main is had tak paagalpan par utaaru dikhataa he ki shuruaati ek drishy main apane friend se phone par kahata he ki usko (ladki) mere paas ghar par bhej do jo (kabhi ek din) tumhaari clinics main meri tarif kar rahi thi
 Overall here again the viewer's view is completely opposite
 wo heroin se pyaar to karata he, magar vaasana se upar uthakar
 In some scenes here, he again enters the image of the Indian hero in an attempt to come out of the shell for a few minutes
 ab baat karte hai heroin kii
 The curiosity of the introduction to the heroine also increases the search for the next scene in the audience
 agle drishyon main darshak ke taur par wo soch rahe hai ki unka hero aaj ke yug kaa hero he
 a hero who seems to be beating the attitude and dearing attitude of today's youth
 ab darshak us heroin main bahut kuch ummid talashta he
 For example, when Kabir Singh announces on campus that he (heroine) is my captive
 duusare ladke jo kabir ke dost hai wo bhi us ladki kii ore ishaara karke dusron ko bataate hai ki wo kabir kii bandi he
 But the girl has to retaliate and retaliate
 har aane vaale drishy main log apni heroin main kuch 'aag' dhundh rahe hai
 Or perhaps we have got used to it that we have become accustomed to seeing the nature of overturning in heroines
 lekin ye kehane main koi gurej nahin ki film yahaan bhi kairactor main jhaankne kii manshaa or nai story kii talash main bandhi hui he
 Then in the third hour, after moments of happiness, romance, love, the turn comes to give a new twist to the story of hero-heroine
 vahaan bhi darshak man shaayad kisi bade you turn kii soch rahaa tha, lekin nahin yahaan bhi unka hero fail hota dikh rahaa he
 That hero is now seen sitting on peculiar scales among the audience
 ladki par puri tarah haaavee wo ladkaa saamaajik tanebane se haar jaataa he
 Now in the next scenes, in the diamonds, sometimes the audience sees an angry, insolent and junky boy, and sometimes a troubled man troubled by his bad habits, who has seen him in the examples around him
 heroin ke kahin or shaadi kar lene ke baad log samaj nahin pate ki wo kabir singh se sahanubhuti karen yaa ye kahen ki acha hua ki ladki isse nahin byaahi gai
 Well, whatever the story, people will say anything but the truth is that in the film, from the changing shade of the hero, the spice of the film such as song music, filming, romance, everything has been mixed in such an equal way that you can go out without watching the whole movie
 Will not be able to come
 haa baahar aakar bhale hi soch sakate hai ki bataao kaisaa hero he jisane puri film main apni nai bhabhi se 'hello' tak nahin kiya
 What a hero who does not understand his dear friend
 kaisaa hero he jo heroin ke dedication ko samajhataa hi nahin, kitna non soshal he hamaara hero

 is hamale main ek yuvak kii maut ho gai jabaki do yuvak gambhir rup se ghayal ho gaye

 When the train reached Okhla railway station, 15 to 20 people boarded their coach from there

 That is when the chaotic people started demanding seats using casteist and communal words
 isi baat ko lekar teenon yuvakon kii aropiyon se garmagarmee ho gai
 Hasib says that when he saw an elder, he gave him a seat
 iske baavjood bhi ve sabhi log gaali galoch karne lage
 Hasib says that after this dispute, he thought that he landed in Faridabad
 jhagada khatm ho jayega lekin faridabad stesan par bheed itani zyada thi ki chaaron log train se nahin sake
 After this, two of the three boys started scuffling
 yah dekhakar haseeb or uske ek saathi ne apane jaankaron ko phone kiya or unhen ballabhagarh railway stesan par aane ke liye kaha
 As soon as the train reached Ballabhgarh railway station, they started descending from the four trains

 ) In this growing e-commerce market, the trend of online shopping is increasing
 aise main agar aapako bhi online shopping kaa shauk he to samajhadaari or saavdhaanee, donon jaruri hai
 Before starting shopping, remember that the computer must have anti-virus
 iske saath hi aaie jaanate hai online shopping ke dauraan hameshaa yaad rakhane vaali 6 baaten jo aapako kisi bhi tarah kii dhokhadhadi se bachaaengi :1
 Do not shop from unknown site
 Internet security is very important when shopping online
 iskaa matlab yah he ki aap hameshaa kisi bharose vaali site se hi kharidari karen
 If you make a payment from an unknown site, then it may be that your account is cleared within a few hours of cybercrime
 vahiin anjaan site se shopping karne par aap is rakam ko clem bhi nahin kar paaenge
 2) Understand the difference between http and https If you are shopping online, first of all, keep in mind that the address of the website from which you are buying goods should have https and not http
 yahaan is jude 'S' kaa matlab security kii guarantee se hota he
 This means that this site is not fake
 haalaankikbhi-kabhi yah 'S' letters website main tab judata he jab baari online pement karne kii aati he
 3) Check the complete information of the website, always check that the address, phone number and email address of the place where you are buying the goods are written on the website
 jahaan dhokhadhadi kii gunjaaish hoti he vahiin aksar jaankaree chhipaai jaati he
 4) Payment system Apart from this, one more thing to be noted is that you can make payment in the payment system of the website through Verified by Visa or mastercard securecode? The answer should always be yes as it helps protect you from fraud
 agar in sab jaanch parakh ke baad aap santusht hai tabhi kharidari karen
 5) Understand the terms of the company in such a manner that it is often the case that companies offer free delivery on purchases above Rs 500
 customer ko bhi yah kaaphi suvidhajanak lagata he
 But sometimes there are some conditions written along with free delivery, which the customer does not pay attention to, and because of this, they have to pay extra price later
 ye wo charge hote hai jo customer ko lubhaane ke liye shuru main bataae hi nahin jate
 6) Check the goods immediately
 Many cases have come up in which there is a lot of rigging of companies
 kai log apana order khol ke dekhte he to usamen puraani chijen yaa phir di gai jaankaree se hatakar ghatiya str kaa saamaan miltaa he
 So check the goods in front of the delivery boy
 agar kuch gadabadi lage to usee ke saamne hi saamaan kii tasviir le len
 In this case, it will be easy to claim the amount

 After the debacle in the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress seems to be beating badly in the Haryana and Maharashtra elections as well
 shuruaati rujhaan main congress donon rajyon main saakh khoti dikh rahi he, vahiin haar kii aahat sunate hi dilli main mahila congress kaaryakartaaon ne party offis ke baahar narebaaji shuru kar di he
 The name of Priyanka Gandhi is at the center of the slogans, then the trouble of losing the workload of the workers
 jaankaree ke mutabik, ravivaar subah kareeb 9 baje shuruaati rujhaan main party kii haar dekhte hue congress kii mahila wing ne party karyaalay ke baahar 'priyanka lao, desh bachaao' ke naare lagane shuru kar die hai
 Although there has been no comment in this regard from the Congress leadership or any big leader, but women activists say that Priyanka Gandhi can only work as a rudder in the party's drowning
 gauratlab he ki yah pehla mauka nahin he, jab congress kaaryakartaaon ne priyanka gandhi ke naam ko aage kiya he
 Earlier, during the UP by-elections and Lok Sabha elections, Congress workers have also raised their voice regarding Priyanka Gandhi's handing over the reins
 haalanki, priyanka gandhi bhi samay-samay par is babat khulkar kah chuki hai ki vah sakriy raajnneeti kaa hissaa nahin bananaa chaahati hai or is ore unke bhai or party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi hi sabase upyukt hai
