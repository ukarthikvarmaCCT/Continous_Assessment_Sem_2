 In Hinduism, many times have been fixed for the worship
 aise main agar offis jane kii hadabadi main aap subah puja nahin kar paaen hai to shaam ko puja kar sakate hai
 But while worshiping in the night or evening, you have to take special precautions, so that peace of mind and life remains
 - aamtaur par suryaast ke vakt hi ishv kii aarti hoti he
 But if you are worshiping after the sun sets or when it is night, do not play conch and bells
 kyonki suryaast ke baad raat hote hi devi-devtaa sone chale jate hai
 - If you worship at night, do not break the flower used in worship
 raat ko vanaspati chhedana acha nahin mana jaataa
 There will be no shortage of money, do Ganapati on Wednesday - Tulsi is required in the worship of Lord Vishnu, Shri Krishna, Satyanarayana ji
 lekin tulsi kaa patta raat main galati se bhi na toden isse lakshmi naaraaz ho jaaengi
 Their worship without Tulsi is not considered complete
 isliye agar raat main puja kerani ho, tab din ke samay hi tulsi patta tod kar rakh len
 If the work stops, then do this remedy- Sun God is the God of the day
 isliye din main agar koi vishesh puja kar rahe hai to saath main suryadev kii puja bhi jarur kerani chahie
 But do not worship Sun God at night

 It is to hunt the other and be inhuman
 in dinon iske bare main isliye zyada sunate hai kyonki zyada sakht kanoonon kii vajah se ab is par ungali uthaai jane lagi he or auraton ko apni pareshaani kaa izhaar karne ke liye samarthan bhi mil rahaa he
 At its core are the cultural gripes that have been entwined with us
 aurat ko barabari ke darje par sweekaar karnaa yaa uski taraf se 'naa' sun paanaa mushkil hota he, tab to or bhi jab lokapriy manoranjan main utpeedan ko rijhaane or sansarg ke khel kii swaabhaavik kadi ke taur par pesh kiya jaataa he
 i am aware of cases in which men are subjected to commentary on the way they wear their female comrades, take pictures of them without their permission or look into their personal lives, falsify their motives, and accuse them of office gossip There is nothing wrong in making the subject
 yon utpeedan kaa pasandida kridasthal daftar se baahar daftar ke aayojan or baithken bani hui hai
 There is also a bit of clumsiness or vacillation in it, and many times i have felt deeply embarrassed when i have heard men justify their behavior, saying that they were drunk or making clever gestures that it was mutual consent Happened, because the woman was smoking cigarettes or alcohol or both and was easily accessible and friendly
 halki-si chhedchhad ko pakkaa nyauta maan liya jaataa he or maanakar chalaa jaataa he ki vah rajamand he
 At a time when women have more freedom and are also using it, every woman who wants to use her options starts being blamed
 iskaa beja nateeja vibhinn kaarysthalon par mahasoos kiya ja rahaa he
 How can anyone counter this? By advising the woman to change herself or to correct her behavior? This will only shatter the concept of gender neutrality, for which we have been working through all these legal safeguards
 kaarysthal par mahilaon kaa yon utpeedan (rokthaam, nishedh or nivaaran) adhinium 2013 main kiye gaye sakht upaay hamaare samaaj main gahari jaden jamaaye baithi jakadanon se is kadar alahada hai ki mahaj korporate kaa peshevraana ravaiya un swatarusfoort pratikriyaaon kaa muqabla nahin kar saktaa jo tanaav kii haalat main ubhar aati hai
 The only way to do this is to make a regular training program on SHA (sexual harassment and abuse), which is being emphasized through digital modules
 jab posh (pioe) kanoon kii karypranali kii baat aati he, tab yahaan tak ki iskaa paalan karne vaale sanghathanon ko bhi kuch ata-pataa nahin hota
 What i often hear is, "I don't know
 
 
 '' vyavhaar se jude 'kya karen' or 'kya na karen' kii talim or nuksaan pahunchane vaali sambhavit sthitiyon kaa prashikshan khaas taur par ahm or jaruri he
 Being told clearly about the serious consequences is effective in preventing such conduct
 dheron aadmi galat samajhe jane ko lekar khaas taur par ghabaraate hai or mahasoos karte hai ki unhen chaikanna rahane kii jarurat he
 i have not seen a single case in which there has been any report of harm or gesture that does not cause harm
 mahilaayein bhi acchhee chuhal or hansi-majaak ko achche andaaj or samajhadaari se sweekaar karti hai
 Complaints have also been made due to hatred, but they are also condemned in the same way as sexual harassment
 jab tak hamaari maansikta nahin badalati, donon ko bhaypoorvak rokane kaa ek ahm hissaa prashikshan hoga
 In the end, what seems to be effective is the seriousness coming in the organizations
 iskaa matlab he ki kanoon kaa paalan mahaj mashin kii tarah nahin kiya ja rahaa—yani ek aantarik shikaayat samiti bana do, karmchaaree kii bhartee karte vakt use esechae kaa masauda thama do yaa ek baar prashikshan dekar dikhaa do ki niyam-kaayadon ko sweekaar kar liya gaya he
 It begins with a genuine desire to build a safe, equitable gender-neutral workplace, where work thrives and lives are transformed by dignity and respect given to everyone
 shiroj ke shi (esaechai)—jo kaarysthal par utpeedan ko khatm karne ke liye technology se sanchalit samaadhaan he—ke jariye ham thik yahi kar rahe hai
 Sexual harassment cannot be avoided in different ways
 isaki bajaae samaveshi kaarysthal banane kii taraf tej raftaar se janaa hoga

 kisaan sanghathan kshetreey vyapak aarthik bhagidaari (aarasieepi, riginal comprihensive iconomic partnership) kaa jamkar virodh kar rahe hai
 After all, why are farmers so nervous about this trade deal? There are two reasons for this
 pehla krishi utpaadan or deyari udyog main lage kisaanon ke ateet ke anubhav or doosraa bhavishya kii chintaa
 The Government of India's policy of importing skimmed milk powder (SMP) from Denmark and New Zealand into zero import duty broke the back of Indian milkmen, or those engaged in the milk production business
 aisa hi ek samjhauta srilanka ke saath chaay kii pattiyon ko lekar hua tha
 The government of India started importing it in zero import duty as well
 2000-2004 ke bich srilanka se chaay kii pattee ke aayaat kaa asar yah hua tha ki gharelu chaay kii pattee kii keemat ek chauthai rah gai thi
 Past experience suggests that prices of domestic products will come down with foreign milk and agricultural products coming to India
 kuch kisaan khule aam or kuch dabe rukh yah sweekaarte hai ki gunvattta ke maamle main vaishvik utpaadon ke saamne gharelu utpaada kahin nahin tikenge
 This fear of the farmers has failed to prepare the agricultural sector for global competition
 jab bharat sarkaar ko badhanaa padaa tha aayaat shuklasaal 2012 main bharat sarkaar ko schimd milk powder par aayaat shulk jiro karne par kisaanon kaa gussa jhelana padaa tha
 Farmers from all over the country came together on the streets
 darasal denmark se schimd milk powder (esaimpi) kaa aayaat kiya ja rahaa tha
 Companies in the country were buying this imported milk powder instead of making powder from the Milk Association of India
 doodh ke powder ko pani main milakar taral doodh banaakar inhen saste daamon main bechaa ja rahaa tha
 This move of the government caused a huge loss to the Indian Milk Association
 iskaa asar doodh utpaadan main lage logon ko hua
 After all, the government had to increase import duties
 newjiland or australia se schimd milk powder or butter aayal ke aayaat shulk ke maamle main bhi yahi hua tha
 Why are farmers nervous about entering the global competition? Farmers leaders expressed another doubt at ND Tiwari Bhawan, located on Deendayal Upadhyay Marg
 vah yah kibhartiya kisanonkheti kii jo suvidhaayen milti hai, jaise sabsidi yaa takneekee madad vah bhi duusare deshon ke mukaable nahin tikti
 That is, if the market is full of foreign agricultural products, then people will not buy Indian agricultural products
 kerala se aae kisaan netaa biju ne ek udhaaharan ke saath bataaya, srilanka or bharat ke bich chaay kii pattiyon kaa aayaat ko lekar ek vyapaar samjhauta hua
 Tea leaf was imported from Sri Lanka from 2000-2004 on zero import duty
 in chaar saalon main gharelu chaay kii pattee kii keemat main baari kami aa gai
 The green leaves of tea cost 16 rupees
 prati kigra
 Reduced from 4 to Rs
 prati kigra
 happened
 bharat main pehle se hi utpaadan mulya ke mukaable kam keemat paane vaale kisaanon ke saamne sabase bada sankat yah he ki videshi utpaada aane se gharelu utpaadon kii maujuuda keemten or kam ho jaaengi
 Is there any reason for the decrease in the quality of the domestic product due to the fear of falling prices of agricultural products? Farmer leaders recognize that the Indian farmer does not compete in competition with international farmers
 to gharelu utpaadon kii gunvattta badhanaa or kisaanon ko antarrashtriya pratispardhaa ke liye taiyaar karnaa kiski jimmedaari he? darasal ab tak kii sarkaron ne krishi utpaadan badhaane ke bare main hi sochaa
 No government has thought about their consumption and quality yet? Farmers will again close the village in protest of the government's decision! Farmers' organizations will now take to the streets to protest against the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP, Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership)
 18 aktubar ko jila colectoron ko piem ke naam gyaapan saunpkar is virodh pradarshan kii shuruyaat to kisaan 'gandhigiri' se karenge
 Meaning no slogans and protest will be united
 sirf haathon main kaali pattee baandhakar apana dukh jaahir karenge
 But if the government does not agree, then on November 2, farmers will block road and highway for a few hours
 or tab bhi sarkaar nahin maani to ek baar phir kisaan 'gaanv band' karenge
 Earlier, on June 10 last year, during a demonstration in Mandsaur, the farmers closed the village in memory of the farmers who were martyred by taking government pill
 haalanki is saal june ko kisaanon ne aisa koi aayojan nahin kiya
 During the village bandh, farmers will not sell milk, fruits and vegetables to dairies
 natijatan shaharon tak ye krishi utpaada nahin pahonchege or logon ke liye mushkilen paidaa hongin
 But Rao Gajendar Singh, who came from Punjab, says that only then people will join with the farmers when they know that if the farmers stop their work then not only the farmers but other people will also come under heavy trouble
 lekin dikkat yah he ki sarkaar kya is dabaav main aegi? philhal 11 aktubar ko chini raashtrapati jinping bharat aa rahe hai
 RCEP may be sealed with China during this time
 itnaa hi nahin november ke shuru main thailand main is masale par asian deshon samet anya chah deshon ke saath is masale par antim muhar lag sakati he
 In such a situation, time will tell how effective the series protests of the farmers will be
 is bich riject aaarasiipi kaa binar haathon main lekar 10 aktubar ko kisaanon ne kendriya railway evam udyog mantri piyush goyal kaa putala dahan kiya

 This is not the end of havoc here

 The woman's husband had cut off the inside of her arm, saying 'you deserve it'
 lekin jab mahila ne bhaagane kii koshish kii to uske pati uske pair main itani jor se maaraa ki uske pair kaa nakhun hi ukhd gaya

 After separating from AJSU, the BJP will have to work hard to overcome the loss for the BJP
 This is a new era of good politics in the state of Sudesh Mahato, where almost all kinds of established perceptions are breaking
 yahaan par na sirf rashtriya raajnneeti kaa paridrishy badla he balki rajya str kii raajnneeti bhi naye pattern par chal rahi he
 Till a few years ago, BJP mainly used to challenge the ruling parties in most of the states, but now it has become the main party in these states
 in rajyon main bijepi bhi ek nai chunauti kaa saamana kar rahi he or use ye chunauti sahyogi partiyaan hi de rahi hai
 When the Shiv Sena quit the BJP in Maharashtra, its setbacks were felt in Jharkhand as well
 chunaav se thik pehle jharkhand main bijepi kii sahyogi rahi ol jharkhand student union (AJSU) ne usase naata tod liya
 When Jharkhand was carved out of Bihar 19 years ago, two things were extremely important in its politics
 pehali, yahaan par abtak kisi bhi party ko apane dam par bahumat nahin mila he
 Second, outgoing Chief Minister Raghuvar Das is the only CM in the state who has completed his term
 bijepi ne 2014 main AJSU ke sahyog se bahumat kaa aankada hasil kiya tha
 In such a situation now that the BJP-AJSU alliance has broken in Jharkhand, how much impact it will have on the politics of the Bharatiya Janata Party giving the slogan 'abki Bar-65 Paar' is also very important
 desh banaam rajya kaa chunaavbijepi ne loksabhaa chunaav main apane pradarshan ke aadhaar par vidhansabha main 65 kaa lakshya par tay kiya he
 In this election, BJP-AJSU had won 12 seats in 14 states and secured 56 percent votes
 is chunaav main sirf bijepi ko hi 52 pratishat vot mili the
 If you look at this performance of BJP-AJSU in the Lok Sabha elections according to the assembly seats, then the conclusion is that BJP and AJSU are ahead in 63 assembly seats while Congress, JMM, JVM and RJD can win 18 seats
 haal hi main hue haryana or maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko voton kaa nuksaan jhelana padaa he
 In Haryana, BJP has lost 22 percent of the votes, while in Maharashtra it has lost 9 percent of the votes
 bijepi par ajasu kaa asedgar ham pichley teen vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon par najar daalen to pate hai ki jharkhand kii 81 siton main se 26 aisi siten hai jahaan AJSU ko vot miltaa rahaa he
 However, this vote share is not very effective
 ye 26 siten aisi hai jahaan pichley teen chunaavon main ajasu ko ausatan 5 fisadi se zyada vot mili hai
 In 2009 AJSU contested 40 seats and garnered 5 percent votes, but Sudesh Mahato's party managed to win 5 seats
 jin 26 siton kii charchaa hamane upar kii he vahaan ajasu kaa vot share 2009 main 14 pratishat rahaa or is party ne 5 siten jeetin
 These areas are mostly tribal areas of Chhotanagpur region
 inamen singhbhum, ranchi, ramgarh, palamu, bokaro jile aate hai
 These areas have also been Naxalite affected
 bijepi is ilaake main thodi kamjor rahi he
 In 2009, BJP got only 17 percent of the vote in this area, but due to alliance with AJSU, its vote share increased to 23 percent
 ajasu or bijepi kaa vot share kul milakar 35 fisadi ho gaya
 New scenario: JMM, Congress and RJD have announced an alliance in Jharkhand
 pichley chunaav main ye sabhi partiyaan alag-alag chunaav ladi thim
 This time, if AJSU manages to retain its vote bank, the BJP may suffer
 is baar ajasu se gathbandhan tuutane kii vajah se bijepi or jeemem-congress ke bich voton kaa antar maatr 14 pratishat rah jayega or isaki vajah se bijepi ko kuch siton kaa nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Expansion in states, bjp's new strategy is to strengthen the party in the states after increasing the dominance at the national level
 isi vajah se bijepi jharkhand main apane sahyogi AJSU ko zyada siten nahin dena chaah rahi he
 If we talk about Zone-2 (55 seats), then bjp's hold in this area is strong
 yahaan par duusari partiyaan 2014 ke pradarshan ko kaayam rakhti hai to bhi bijepi congress or jhamumo ko sanyukt rup se mili voton se 8 pratishat aage rahegi
 However, the recent election results show that the BJP has not been as strong in the assembly elections as it was in the Lok Sabha elections
 jharkhand ek aisa rajya he jahaan kii 28 fisadi aabaadi adivasee he, or yahaan par jeemem, jeviem or ajasu kaa adivasee voton par acha khaasaa prabhutv he
 In such a situation, the leaving of a partner with BJP who has a good hold on these votes can prove to be harmful for the BJP

 The party accused Modi of 'lying' due to claims that he benefited by amending 13 laws
 modi kii ore se radio par 'man kii baat' kiye jane ke baad congress ne kaha ki 13 adhiniyamon main sanshodhan saal 2013 ke bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon ke anivaary praavdhaanon kaa hissaa the
 Modi said that lies are being spread on the issue of this bill
 congress netaa jairam ramesh ne is daawey ko lekar bhi sawaal kiya ki 2013 ke kanoon ke kaaran raksha evam suraksha se judi pariyojnaon main deree hui
 At Congress headquarters, Ramesh said, 'modi claimed in his mind that he has brought amendments in 13 laws
 unhone kisi par ehsaan nahin kiya he
 He said that in the Land Acquisition (rehabilitation and resettlement-act-2013) it was determined that amendments to the 13 laws that Modi has talked about will be done within a year

 Anna Hazare has said that today's democracy is not for the people, by the people and for the people, but Latsahbi
 unhone kaha ki kanoon banane kii prakriya se logon ko alag kar dene ke kaaran bhrashtachar badha he
 Condemning the failure of the Rajya Sabha to pass the Lokpal Bill, social activist Anna Hazare made a bold suggestion to introduce a law that would make the gram sabhas even above Parliament
 anna paksh kii ek sangoshtee main video ke madhyam se sambodhan karte hue hajaare ne kaha ki yadi sarkaar gram sabhaaon ko shashakt banane ke liye kanoon nahin laati he to logon ko jan lokapal vidheyak andolan ke jaise andolan ke liye qamar kasni hogi
 He said, 'lok Sabha thinks it is above everyone
 yah galat he
 People have chosen you
 atev ve aapse upar hai
 It is a sacred temple of democracy
 aise pavitra sthaan par lokapal vidheyak ko lekar pichley dinon rajyasabha main kya hua
 During his half-hour speech, he said, '550 people were giving their suggestions
 kisi ne bhi logon se unki raay nahin poocha
 Therefore, we need another law
 vidhansabhaayen or loksabhaa sochati hai ki ve gramsabhaaon se upar he
 But the gram sabhas are above you
 hamen ek aise kanoon kii jarurat he jo gramsabhaaon ko aise adhikaar pradaan kare
 Hazare said that what happened in the Rajya Sabha on the last day of the Parliament session was wrong
 unhone kaha, ‘nirvaachit pratinidhi apane aap hi apni raay de rahe hai
 This is not a true democracy
 aisa kyon hua
 Because the owners were sleeping
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘loksabhaa sochati he ki vah gramsabha se upar he
 550 people think they are above everyone else
 yah soch galat he
 He said that there should be such provisions in the new law that if the panchayat spends money without contacting the gram sabha or without its consent, it can be dismissed
 majboot gramsabha kii vakaalat karte hue hajaare ne vishesh aarthik kshetra ke liye jameen adhigrahan kii prakriya kaa hawala diya or kaha ki gaanvon main jameenon ke maalik tathaa gramsabha ko yah pataa bhi nahin chal paata he ki kab sarkaar ne bina uski ijaajat ke jameen adhigrahit kar lee
 He said, 'when our servants were looting our treasures, we the owners were sleeping
 ab ham jaag gaye hai
 If the government does not bring the law, then we will have to launch a similar movement as we waged on August 16 (in Ramlila Maidan) for a strong Lokpal Bill
 ’hajaare ne daawa kiya ki aaj kaa loktantr jan ke liye, jan ke dwaara tathaa jan kaa nahin he balki latsahabi he
 He said that corruption has increased due to the separation of people from the process of law making
 unhone kaha, ‘jin logon ko khajaanon kii suraksha kerani he ve hi ve log hai jo inhen lut rahe hai
 It is the responsibility of the people as they fall asleep after sending an elected representative to Parliament and Legislatures
 ’hajaare ne kaha, ‘ham unhen apane sevak ke rup main bhejte hai lekin ve hamaare maalik ke rup main vyavhaar kar rahe hai
 The laws that are being made are weak because you are not contacting the boss
 ’ unhone kaha ki yadi sarkaar kanoon banane ke dauraan logon se unki raay nahin leti to british shashan or maujuuda shashantantr main koi antar nahin he
 He re-sought the right to recall and the right to dismiss laws

 It is said that the work of fixing the current tax law has been completed, but it has been stopped with the expectations of the public before the general budget 2019-20

 This will be brought after the budget, as our focus is on the Finance Bill
 " haalanki adhikari ne is sambandh koi byoraa nahin diya
 He said that unnecessary expectations would arise if the draft were to come now
 adhikari ne sanket diya ki nae kanoon main na sirf naukari pesha logon par kar kaa bhaar kam kiya jayega, balki ritern daakhil karne kii prakriya bhi saral banaai jaaegi

 However, when the statements were taken again from Bharti, she said that she did so in her statement as she had been taught
 ab court kii bench ne kaha he ki bharti kii donon gavaahi se yah saaf hota he ki use gavaahi dene se pehle se taiyaar kiya gaya tha

 There was blood on the floor and railing inside
 is gavaah ke maamle main bachaav paksh ne sibiai se sawaal kiya ki unhen sanjay ke bare main kaise pataa chalaa
 Because Sanjay clearly stated during his testimony in the trial court that he had not spoken to the police at the scene
 is baat se saaf najar aata he ki sanjay sibiai kaa banaaya hua ek farji gavaah tha

 In this case, the court pointed out that in 2008, the CBI conducted a sound test
 darasal, rajesh or noopur ne kaha tha ki asi chalane kii aawaaj kii vajah se un donon ke kamare ke baahar hone vaali kisi bhi kriya kii aawaaj nahin aati
 This proved to be true even in the test, but this was not stated in the trial court
 is cese ke trial ke dauraan bachaav paksh ne kaha tha ki hemraj ke khun se sanaa takiya, compounder krishna ke kamare main mila
 Rajkumar and Vijay, including Krishna, were detained for questioning
 lekin baad main unhen chhod diya gaya
 During the action, the defense said that it was clear that Krishna and Hemraj were together on the night of the murder
 iske alaava rajesh or noopur ko chhodkar or bhi kuch log ghar main maujuud the
 However, the documents that the CBI has submitted said that the pillow and its cover were recovered from Hemraj's room
 iske saath sidiendi, hyderabad kii report main "typographical galati" hui thisibiai kii report main saaf tha ki sabooton main "kisi bhi galati kii koi sambhaavna nahin he"
 But there was a difference in the evidence presented before the court
 court ne sidiendi ke espi aar
 Also pointed to Prasad's testimony
 prasad ne kaha tha ki sabhi 56 sabooton ko thik se band kiya gaya tha
 But the evidence was later tampered with
 trial court ne note kiya tha ki naukarhemraj kaa shavghar kii chat par mila tha
 The roof doors were also closed at that time
 chat ke daravaaje ko is vaaradat se pehle kabhi band nahin kiya gaya tha or talwaar ne police ko lock kii chaabi nahin di thi
 With this, it was said that no outsider can take the body up nor dress up the crime scene
 haalanki, hai court ne hemraj ke shav chupaane vaali baat ko nakaar diya
 In this case it was said earlier that the Talwar couple killed Hemraj and hid his body on the roof
 taaki baad main use thikaane laga diya jaae
 But according to the bench, Hemraj's body was not found due to the negligence of Noida police in the investigation after the murder
 abhiyojan paksh ne bataaya tha ki aarushi kii hatya ke turant baad flats ko dhoyaa gaya tha
 However, the High Court has clearly stated in this case that no evidence has been found by the Noida Police and CBI

 The President also drew attention to the increasing crimes against women in the society and recalled Rabindranath Tagore, saying that he considered women to be home-lit ladies and the light of soul
 unhone kanoon banane ke liye baar-baar adhyadesh laae jane par bhi aapatti jataai

 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon,66wein ganatantr diwas kii purv sandhya par main bharat or videshon main based aap sabhi ko hardik badhai detaa hum
 i extend my special greetings to the members of our armed forces, paramilitary forces and internal security forces
 chhbbees janvari kaa din hamaare desh kii smriti main ek chirsthai sthaan rakhata he, kyonki yahi vah din he jab aadhunik bharat kaa janm hua tha
 Under the moral and political leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, the National Congress passed the resolution of complete Swaraj in December 1929 demanding complete independence from the British Raj
 26 janvari, 1930 ko, gandhi ji ne puure desh main swatantraaa diwas ke rup main rashtravyapee samarohon kaa aayojan kiya tha
 From the same day, the country pledged to continue the freedom struggle on this day every year till we achieved it
 thik bees varsh baad, 1950 main, hamane aadhuniktaa ke apane ghoshnaptr, samvidhan ko angikaar kiya
 It was ironic that Gandhiji was martyred two years ago, but the framework of the constitution that made India ideal before the modern world was designed on his own philosophy
 iskaa saar chaar siddhanton par aadhaarit he: loktantr; dharm kii swatantraaa; langik samanta; tathaa garibi ke jaal main fanse logon kaa aarthik utthan
 These were made constitutional obligations
 desh ke shaskaon ke liye gandhi ji kaa mantra saral or shaktishaalee tha, ‘jab bhi aap kisi shankaa main hon
 
 
 Then remember the face of the poorest and most weak person you have seen and then ask yourself
 
 
 kya isse bhukhe or aadhyatmik kshudha se peedit lakhon logon ke liye swaraj aayega
 'our resolve to eradicate poverty through inclusive development should be a step in that direction
 pyaare deshavaasiyon,pichhlaa varsh kai tarah se vishisht rahaa he
 Especially because after three decades, the people have voted for a stable government, giving a single party majority, to bring it to power and in the process free the governance of the country from the compulsions of coalition politics

 Dear countrymen, governance is not possible without an active legislature

 It is a stage where progressive legislation should be created by progressive legislation to realize the aspirations of the people, using courteous dialogue
 iske liye bhagidaaron ke bich matbhedon ko dur karne tathaa banaae jane vaale kanoonon par aam sahmati laane kii jarurat hoti he
 Legislation without discussion stirs the law-making role of Parliament
 isse, janata dwaara vyakt vishwaas tuutata he
 This is neither good for democracy nor good for policies related to these laws

 balaatkaar, hatya, sadakon par chhedchhad, apharan tathaa dahej hatyaon jaise atyaacharon ne mahilaon ke man main apane gharon main bhi bhay paidaa kar diya he
 Rabindranath Tagore not only considered women to be the lighters of the house but also considered them to be the light of the soul

 We have enacted many laws, but as Benjamin Franklin once said, 'the purpose of justice will not be fulfilled until those who feel as angry as those who are not as oppressed 
 ’ har ek bhartiya ko kisi bhi prakaar kii hinsa se mahilaon kii hifaazat karne kii shapath leni chahie
 Only such a country can become a global power that respects and empowers its women

 Freedom inherent in democracy sometimes brings a new annoying result in the form of ecstatic competition which is against our traditional nature
 vaani kii hinsa chot pahunchaati he or logon ke dilon ko ghayal karti he
 Gandhiji had said that religion is the strength of unity, we cannot make it a cause of confrontation
 pyaare deshavaasiyon,bharat kii saumy shakti ke bare main bahut kuch kaha jaataa he
 But in such an international environment, where many countries are getting entangled in the morass of religion-based violence, the most powerful example of India's benign power lies in our definition of the relationship between religion and the polity
 hamane sadaiv dharmik samanta par apana bharosa jataayaa he, jahaan har dharm kanoon ke saamne baraabar he tathaa prayek samskruti duusare main milakar ek sakaaratmak gatishiltaa kii rachana karti he
 The wisdom of India teaches us: unity is strength, sovereignty is weakness

 We have the strength, faith and determination to defeat the masters of the fight against our people
 simarekha par yuddh viraam kaa baar-baar ulanghan tathaa aatankwaadi akramanon kaa, kargar kootneeti tathaa abhedya suraksha pranali ke madhyam se samekit jawaab diya janaa chahie

 The strength of the external sector, progress towards fiscal consolidation, lowering of the level of prices, early signs of return to manufacturing and record of agricultural production in the last year are good signs for our economy

 hamaari rashtriya gaatha ko iske ateet ke siddhanton or aadhunik uplabdhiyon se aakaar mila he tathaa yah aaj apni prachhann shakti ko jaagrath kar bhavishya ko apana banane ke liye tatpar he
 Dear countrymen, our national ambition is to raise the standard of living of the Indian people rapidly and to prepare generations endowed with knowledge, patriotism, compassion, honesty and sense of duty

 We are celebrating the centenary of Gandhiji's return from South Africa this year
 ham kabhi bhi mahatma ji se sikh lenaa nahin chodenge
 The first thing he did in 1915 was to keep his eyes open and his mouth shut
 is udhaaharan ko apnaanaa acha hoga
 While we are talking about 1915, which is justified, we should probably have a look at the work that Gandhiji had done in 1901, the year he returned home on his first vacation
 congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan us varsh kalakatta main yojit hua tha jo us samay british bharat kii rajdhani tha
 He went to Ripon College for a meeting
 unhone dekha ki baithak main bhaag lene vaale logon ne saare sthaan ko ganda kar diya he
 Stunned to see this, Gandhiji did not wait for the sweeper to come
 unhone jhaadu uthaai tathaa us sthaan kii safai kar daali
 No one followed his example in 1901
 aaie, ek sau chaudaa varsh baad ham unke udhaaharan kaa anukaran karen tathaa ek mahaan pita ke suyogy bachche bane

 Even though these instructions by Chief Justice Barin Ghosh and Justice Alok Singh were related to a small section of the river under the control of Haridwar Development Authority, the Vijay Bahuguna government was clearly in control of the flood plains and banks of the restless rivers of the state
 Similarly, thousands of people standing were motivated to take action against them

 choti sahaayak nadiyon main to yah aankada 90 pratishat ja saktaa he
 Most of these projects are being built on river flows, in which water of many tributaries of Ganga is diverted into tunnels, due to which the rivers have completely dried up for long distances except in monsoon

 soshal media par saamne aae saaho ke rivyuu main movie ke ection or stant seens kii jamkar tarif kii gai he, prabhas kii damdaar acting ko bhi saraahaa gaya he
 But the duration of the film, storylines and VFX quality are also being criticized

 Well it remains to be seen how much Saaho is able to impress audiences and critics at the Indian box office
 janmashtami (janmashtami) hinduon kaa pramukh tyohaar he
 Janmashtami is being celebrated with pomp across the country
 hindu manyataon ke anusaar sristi ke paalanhaar shri hari vishnu ke aathven avatar natkhat nandlaal yani ki shrikrishna ke janmdin ko shrikrishna jayanti (shri Krishna Jayanti) yaa janmashtami ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 However, this time people are quite confused about the date of Krishna Janmashtami
 log uljhan main hai ki janmashtami 23 agast yaa phir 24 agast ko manaai jaae
 Actually, it is believed that Lord Krishna was born on the Ashtami of Krishna Paksha of Bhado month in Rohini Nakshatra
 agar ashtami tithi ke hisaab se dekhen to 23 agast ko janmashtami honi chahie, lekin agar rohinee nakshatra ko maane to phir 24 agast ko krishna janmashtami honi chahie
 Let us tell you that for some people, the importance of Ashtami Tithi is the highest, while some people celebrate Janmashtami only when it is Rohini Nakshatra
 janmashtami ke din krishna ko lagaaein is ek cheez kaa bhoga, nahin padegi 56 bhoga banane kii jaruratarongte khadey kar degaa ye prasang, jab krishna ne duryodhana se kaha - ‘baandhne mujhe to aayaa he, zanjeer badi kya laayaa he?'janmashtami 2019: janmashtami kab he? 23 yaa 24 agast, jaaniye yahanakashwani sunakar kansa apane bahanoi vasudev ko jaan se maarane ke liye uth khadaa hua
 Then Devaki humbly said to her - 'I will bring you the child from my womb
 bahanoi ko maarane se kya laabh he?' kansa ne devaki kii baat maan lee or mathura waapas chalaa aayaa
 He puts Vasudev and Devaki in jail
 kaal kothri main hi devaki ke garbh se saat bachche hue lekin kansa ne unhen paidaa hote hi maar daalaa
 Now there was going to be an eighth child
 karagaar main un par kade pehre baitha die gaye
 At the same time, Nanda's wife Yashoda was also going to have a child
 jis samay vasudev-devaki ko putr paidaa hua, usee samay sanyog se yashoda ke garbh se ek kanya kaa janm hua, jo or kuch nahin sirf 'maaya' thi
 In the cell where devaki-vasudev was imprisoned, suddenly there was light and in front of him appeared the quadrilateral god holding conch, chakra, mace, Padma
 donon bhagwaan ke charnon main gir pade
 Then God said to him- 'now i take the form of a newborn baby again
 tum mujhe isi samay apane mitra nand ke ghar vrundavan main bhej aao or unke yahaan jo kanya janmi he, use laakar kansa ke hawaale kar do
 At this time the environment is not favorable
 phir bhi tum chintaa na karo
 Awake guards will fall asleep, the gates of the prison will open automatically and the swollen Yamuna will give you a way to cross
 'usee samay vasudev navjaat shishu-rup shrikrishna ko soup main rakhkar karagrih se nikal pade or athaah yamuna ko paar kar nand ke ghar pahunche
 There he put the newborn to sleep with Yashoda and came to Mathura with the girl
 karagrih ke phatak pehle kii tarah band ho gaye
 Then Kansa went to the prison and tried to snatch the newborn girl from Devaki's hand and slam her on the earth, but the girl flew into the sky and said from there - 'hey fool, what will happen if i kill you? The one who killed you has reached Vrindavan
 vah jald hi tuje tere paapon kaa dand degaa
 My name is Vaishnavi and i am Maya of the same Jagadguru Vishnu
 ' itnaa kahkar vah antardhyaan ho gai
 Fearful of his death, Kansa summons Pootna and orders him to kill Krishna
 kansa kii ajna paakar putana ne ek atyant sundar stri kaa rup dhaaran kiya or nand baba ke ghar pahunch gai
 Seeing the opportunity, he picked up Krishna and started feeding him
 stanpan karte hue krishna ne uske praan bhi har liye
 Kansa became even more worried after hearing the news of Pootna's death
 is baar usne keshi naamak ashv daitya ko krishna ko maarane ke liye bheja
 Krishna climbed over him and brought him to Yamlok
 phir kansa ne arishth naamak daitya ko bail ke rup main bheja
 Krishna was playing in his hair form
 khelte-khelte hi unhone us daitya rupi bail ke sigon ko kshan bhar main tod kar use maar daalaa
 Then the demon Kansa sent a demon named Kaal as a crow
 vah jaise hi krishna ko maarane ke liye unke paas pahunchaa
 Sri Krishna grabbed the crows and crushed his throat and crushed his wings with his hands, killing the demon called Kaal
 ek din shrikrishna yamuna nadi ke tat par khel rahe the tabhi unase gend nadi main ja giri or ve gend laane ke liye nadi main kud pade
 Here, as soon as Yashoda got the news, she rushed to the banks of river Yamuna and started mourning
 shri krishna jab neeche pahunche to nagaraj kii patni ne kaha- 'he bhadra! yahaan par kis sthaan se or kis prayojan se aae ho? yadi mere pati nagaraj kaaliya jag gaye to ve tumhen bhakshan kar jaayenge
 Then Krishna said, 'I am the Kaalya Nag's Kaal and by killing him, i have come here to sanctify this Yamuna river
 ' aisa sunate hin kaaliya naag sote se uthaa or shrikrishna se yuddh karne laga
 When Kalia Nag was completely mortified, then his wife came there and started praising Krishna to protect her husband's life, 'O Lord! i did not recognize you Bhubaneswar Krishna
 he janaad! main mantron se rahit, kriyaaon se rahit or bhakthi bhav se rahit hum
 Protect me he dev! he hare! prasad rup main mere swami ko mujhe de do arthath mere pati kii raksha karo
 'then Shri Krishna said that you leave this Yamuna river with your brothers and brothers and go elsewhere
 iske baad kaaliya naag ne krishna ko pranaam kar yamuna nadi ko chhod kar kahin or chalaa gaya
 Krishna also came out of the river Yamuna with his ball
 idhar, kansa ko jab koi upaay nahin soojha tab usne akrur ko bula kar kaha ki nandagaanv jaakar krishna or balram ko mathura bula lao
 On coming to Mathura, he declared a Malla war with Kansa wrestlers Chanur and Mushtik
 akhaade ke dwaar par hin kansa ne kuvalay naamak hathi ko rakh choda tha, taaki wo krishna ko kuchal sake
 But Sri Krishna also killed that elephant
 uske baad shrikrishna ne chaanur ke gale main apana pair fansaa kar yuddh main use maar daalaa or baldev ne mushtik ko maar giraaya
 After this, Kesha's brother Keshi was also killed by Keshav
 baldev ne moosal or hal se or krishna ne sudarshan chakra se daityon ko magh maas kii shukla paksh kii saptami ko maar daalaa
 Shri Krishna said- 'O wicked Kansa! Wake up, i will kill this place and free this earth from your weight
 ' yah kehete hue krishna ne kansa ke baalo ko pakadaa or ghumaakar prithvi par patake diya jisase vah maar gaya
 On the death of Kamsa, the gods showered Krishna and Baldev from the sky
 phir krishna ne mata devaki or vasudev ko karagrih se mukt karaayaa or ugrasen ko mathura kii gaddi saunp di

 Modi government's decision for elderly and disabled people of this category will be able to cast votes through postal ballot
 Elderly and disabled people above 80 years can now vote through postal ballot
 centre sarkaar ne yah faisla liya he
 However, candidates of this category can also vote at the polling booth as per their wish
 inke liye donon vikalp maujuud rahegaa
 On the recommendations of the Election Commission, the Union Law and Justice Ministry amended the Election Rules, 1961, under which the disabled and senior citizens have been allowed to be included in the absentee voter list
 abcenti voter kaa matlab- jo matadaata vot daalane ke liematdaan centre tak pahunchane main asamarth ho
 Postal ballot paper will be issued As per the amended rule, the person will apply in a new Form 12D, which will reach the returning officer within 5 days after the date of notification of election
 is aavedan ko praapt kiye jane ke baad nirvaachak (vot dene vaale shaks) ko ek postal ballat paper jari kiya jayega
 That postal ballot will be submitted to the Specified Center after the recording of the vote
 ayog kaa kahana he ki iskaa makasad zyada umr yaa divyang vyaktiyon kii bhi matdaan main bhagidaari sunishchit karnaa he
 According to officials, both the disabled and elderly people are unable to reach the polling booth due to which they are unable to cast their vote

 - with AIR Inpur madhya pradesh (MP Government) sachivalay main maheene kii pehali taarikh ko vandemataram gane kii 13 saal puraani parampara is baar tut gai he
 On January 1, the first working day of the new year, 'vande Mataram' was not sung in the ministry
 ab ise lekar ek nayaa vivaad shuru ho gaya he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is strongly criticizing the Congress party in power for not singing Vande Mataram on the first working day of the month at the secretariat
 ise lekar soobe ke purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan (shivraj Singh Chauhan) ne bhi apni pratikriya di he
 He tweeted that the Congress has forgotten that governments come but there is nothing above country and patriotism
 main maang karata hum ki vande maataram kaa gaanaa hameshaa kii tarah har cabinet kii meeting se pehle or har maheene kii pehali taarikh ko hameshaa kii taraf vallabh bhawan ke praangan main ho
 Congress may have forgotten that governments come and go, but there is nothing above country and patriotism
 main maang karata hoon ki vande maataram kaa gaan hameshaa kii tarah har cabinet kii meeting se pehle or har maheene kii pehali tarikh ko hameshaa kii tarah vallabh bhawan ke praangan main ho
 In another tweet, Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that if the Congress does not know the words of the national anthem or is ashamed of singing the national anthem, then tell me! On the first date of every month, i will sing Vand Mataram with the public in the courtyard of Vallabh Bhavan
 agar congress ko raashtra geet ke shabd nahin aate hai yaa phir raashtra geet ke gayan main shame aati he, to mujhe bataa den! har maheene kii pehali tarikh ko vallabh bhawan ke praangan main janata ke saath vande maataram main gaaounga
 Jai Hind! Whereas, bjp's Madhya Pradesh unit spokesperson Rajneesh Agarwal wrote on Twitter that Vande Mataram was organized by the General Administration Department, which is owned by (chief Minister) Kamal Nath
 kya yah unke aadesh dwaara band kiya gaya he? unhone haal hi main kaha he ki ve kisi kaary kii aalochana kii parvaah nahin karenge
 Agarwal further wrote that now (in Madhya Pradesh) will there be a ban on speaking 'bharat Mata Ki Jai'? Attempts to get feedback from Prabhanshu Kamal, Additional Chief Secretary, General Administration Department of Madhya Pradesh, could not succeed
 vahiin, madhya pradesh congress ke pravaktaa bhoopendra gupta ne is ghatana ko zyada tool na dete hue kaha ki mukhyamantri kamalnath aaj bhopal main nahin hai or sudhi ranjan mohanti ne mangalvaar ko hi madhya pradesh ke mukhya sachiv kaa kaarybhaar sambhala he, ho saktaa he ki iske chalate vande maataram aaj nahin gaaya gaya ho
 He said that why is BJP making a mess of this? If it is not sung today, it will be sung tomorrow or later
 ise galat najariye se na dekha jaae
 (from input language) gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kaa saakshaatkaar karne ke baad samaajawaadee party se nikaale gaye shahid siddiqui ne dalgat raajnneeti se dur rahane kaa elaan karte hue kaha he ki unhen party ne vot bank kii khatir bali kaa bakra banaaya he
 Siddiqui said in the conversation, 'I interviewed Modi as a journalist
 meraa makasad modi ko kisi tarah kaa bhi phayda pahunchaana nahin tha
 i have tried to explain the situation after the 2002 riots, which people had forgotten
 samaajawaadee party ne mujhe baahar karne kaa faisla sirf vot bank kii raajnneeti kii vajah se kiya he
 He bluntly said, 'to be honest, i have been made a goat in the guise of Modi
 ’ siddiqui ne kaha ‘unke (sapa ke) dil main chor he
 He first inducts Kalyan Singh, inducts Sakshi Maharaj and then apologizes for it
 main hameshaa dharm nirpekshata ke liye ladaa hum or laduunga
 This decision of the Samajwadi Party is extremely regrettable and an attack on journalism
 is party main sirf parivaarwaad kii chal rahi he
 Recently Modi was interviewed by Siddiqui for his Urdu weekly 'nayi Duniya', in which Modi refused to apologize for the 2002 riots, saying that if he (modi) was found guilty, he would be hanged
 Be offered yah puche jane par ki unhone is vakt modi kaa saakshaatkaar kyon kiya, to siddiqui ne kaha, ‘bahut saare log is tarah ke sawaal kar rahe hai jo puri tarah se bemaani hai
 i got a chance to interview Modi as a journalist and i did
 maine to modi se vah sawaal puche jo shaayad koi nahin puch saktaa tha
 He said, 'I had no other motive to interview Modi
 ’ agle siyaasi kadam ke bare main puche jane par siddiqui ne kaha ‘main ab dalgat raajnneeti se dur rahoonga, lekin likhane, padhane or bolne kaa meraa silsilaa chalata rahegaa
 All parties have restrictions on the freedom to speak and write, in such a situation, i cannot do party politics
 isliye kisi party se judane kaa sawaal hi nahin he

 Kabul Police Chief Abdul Rahman Rahimi said, 'this is an attack, there have been many casualties
 ' haalanki rahimi ne yah nahin bataaya ki is hamale main kitne log maare gaye or kitne ghayal hue

 Police and army surrounded the area

 yah vahi ramlila maidan he, jo lokapal andolan kaa aayojan sthal bana tha

 The hill state of Himachal Pradesh is $ 50 crore (rs 2,750 crore)
 ) kii ek ski ghati pariyojna ko ganvaane ke kagaar par he
 Reason: Not being able to form clear thinking for the state government
 2004 main congress ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ne himalayan ski vaili (echesavi) pariyojna ko manjuuri pradaan kii thi lekin janvari, 2010 main bhaajapa sarkaar ne use radd kar diya
 In terms of tourism, it was considered the most FDI project
 niti main hue is badlaav par himachal hycourt ne prem kumaar dhumal sarkaar ko kadi fatkaar lagaai he
 Justice Ravi Sharma said in his order dated 22 June, “governance is a continuous process
 nitigat maamalon main rajya sarkaar kii ore se liye jane vaale faislon main nirantarata honi chahie
 "the case dates back to January 2004 when Alfred Ford, the grandson of Ford Motors founder Henry Ford, met Virbhadra Singh and proposed a ski resort in the Kullu Valley
 america hotel develper tathaa echesavi ke prabandh nideshak jon sims kehete hai, "ise daavos ko bharat kaa jawaab hona tha
 This could provide employment to 3,500 people
 "virbhadra sarkaar ne unhen anumati pradaan kar di thi or disambar, 2005 main pradesh sarkaar tathaa echesavi ke bich ek emoyu (sahmati patr) par dastakhat bhi ho gaye
 Three months later, the state government also approved the detailed project report
 sims or unki team ne 100 acre ke plot par banane vaali ski resort pariyojna ke liye kaam bhi shuru kar diya
 The search for suitable people began and 60 local people were sent to Finland to train as ski instructors
 pramotaron ne nirmaan kaary kii pramukh company shapurjipalonji ke liye rasta banaaya or use jimmedaari saunpkar lakjri group sicks sences risottdtors and spa kii duniya main pravesh kiya
 But as the government changed in 2007, the government's policy towards the project also changed
 2008 main pariyojna kii samiksha ke liye dhumal sarkaar ne ek cameti gathit kar di
 Which recommended the cancellation of the project and on 7 January 2010, the BJP government canceled it
 sims kehete hai, "pehle to unhone (bhaajapa sarkaar ne) hamaari yojanaon ko gaur se dekhne main do saal lagaae, phir hamane paise kharch karnaa shuru kar diya, or ab ve kehete hai, maaf kijiega, ham to majaak kar rahe the
 i could not understand the joke, i have definitely become a joke myself ”
 dilachasp to yah he ki samiti kii jin siforeeshon ne dhumal ko kaayal kar diya, lekin adaalat ne unhen nakaar diya
 The court remarked, "it has been proved that the state government had already decided to cancel the project and sending the notice on the basis of the committee's recommendations was merely a ritual payment
" company ko 7 janvari, 2010 ko jari notice sarkaar ke adhikaar kshetra or kanoon ke daayre ke baahar he
 "shortly after this High Court decision, Dhumal announced to appeal to the Supreme Court
 unhone kaha, "sarkaar pariyojna ke khilaaf nahin thi
 We held a public hearing at the project site
 pariyojna par sthaneey logon tathaa gaiyr-sarkari sanghathanon ne aapatti jataai kyonki unhen lagata he ki yah na sirf paryaavaran kii drushti se kharaab he, balki yah bhoomi ko bhi apavitra kar degi
 "those opposing the project also claimed that the gods were against him
 pariyojna ke khilaaf sthaneey bhavanaaen aahat hone main is baat kaa jabardast asar padaa
 Another objection was that the whole project was a "clever move" to grab local land
 lekin in daleelon se naaraaz sims kehete hai, "ham 100 acre jameen par 3,500 naukariyaan pradaan kar rahe the
 Why would i want to grab land? i was not going to start any naval base there
 vah jameen kolrado kii jameen kii tulana main teen guna mahangi he
 "they say," the court has rejected every excuse of the state government
 "haalanki adaalat ne pariyojna par kaam karne kii ijaajat de di he lekin echesavi ke pramotor yah tay nahin kar paa rahe hai ki 8 saal or 100 karod ru
 Whether or not to continue the work after the expense is incurred
 sims and company sarkaar ke is vyavhaar ko 'asthir vyavhaar' kahati he or unhen ashanka he ki pradesh main november main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ke baad aane vaali sarkaar kaa kya rukh hoga

 The incident took place just 100 feet away from the religious site 'harmandir Sahib' in the Golden Temple complex

 a year after assuming power in 2007, Mayawati separated a part of Etah district and created Kanshiram Nagar in the name of the BSP founder, and felt that the new district would leave all the dimensions of development behind

 Political analyst Surendra Singh says, "mayawati strengthened the party's affiliation with her base by creating new districts in the name of Dalit men
" party ko iskaa laabh ek simit daayre main nahin balki samgr rup se vidhansabha chunaavon main mila
 Mayawati's strategy of strengthening the bsp's base in the stronghold of the opponents by separating Shamli from Muzaffarnagar, district Prabudh Nagar, Ghaziabad's Hapur, Panchsheel Nagar and Moradabad's Sambhal and Badaun's Gunnore from Bhimnagar district is

 Today is the 101st birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
 fauladi iraadon or nidar faislon vaali desh kii pehali mahila pradhanmantri kaa janm 19 november 1917 ko hua tha
 Indira Gandhi took over the reins of the country for three consecutive times between 1966 and 1977 and then reached the post again in 1980 and was assassinated on 31 October 1984 while still in office
 unka janm elahabaad main hua tha, unka bachapan kaa naam priyadarshini tha
 She was a soft-spoken woman with an effective personality and knew the skill to implement her tough decisions with sheer boldness
 unhone june, 1984 main amritsar main sikhon ke pavitra sthal swarna mandir se aatankwaadiyon ko baahar nikaalane ke liye sainya karrwai ko anjaam diya tha
 Former PM Indira Gandhi's birth anniversary today: Tributes paid by Modi, Sonia and Rahul Apart from this, the declaration of Emergency in 1975 and subsequent developments are also seen as a harsh decision
 swatantra bharat ke itihaas main yah sabase vivadaspad kaal tha
 Elections were postponed during the Emergency
 ise aaazaad bharat kaa sabase vivaadaaspad daur bhi mana jaataa he
 The next morning, on 26 June, the entire nation heard the declaration of emergency in the voice of Indira Gandhi on the radio

 iske baad shastri ji ke nidhan par vah desh kii teesri pradhanmantri chuni gai
 Indira Gandhi was also awarded the Bharat Ratna in the year 1971
 bataa den, 31 oktober 1984 main subah savere unke sikh body gards ne maut ke ghat utaar diya tha
 Awarded with Bharat Ratna, Indira Gandhi entered active politics after the death of her father Jawaharlal Nehru
 unhone pratham baar pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri ke kaarykaal main soochna or prasaaran mantri kaa pad sambhala
 After this, on the death of Shastriji, she was elected the third Prime Minister of the country

 But on the way, an acquaintance of an acquaintance lady arrested the accused at the hands of the police even before the big incident

 The innocent student who is currently kidnapped is now with his family
 kidanaper mukeshpulisaki giraft main he
 He is under interrogation
 yah hairat kii baat he ki bataur test captain tim pine ko mili pehali jeet ke asal hero ke bare main koi baat hi nahin kar rahaa
 The title of man of the match went to Nathan Lyon, who broke the back of Indian batting on a fast pitch, and the discussions revolved around captain Virat Kohli, at least in the Indian media
 kabhi to pehali pari main unke umdaa shatak ke bahaane to kabhi australian captain ke saath kahasuni ko lekar
 Anti heroes are for such occasions
 yah thik he ki finch or haris ne donon pariyon main australia ko acha start diya lekin duusari pari main finch ke jakhmi hokar maidan chhodane ke ekaadh ghante ke bheetar hi unki team buree tarah se baikfoot par aa gai thi
 It was only and only Usman Khwaja who stood in awe on this occasion
 pakistan kii rajdhani islamabad main janmen khwaja kaa rahasyamay sufiwaad se kitna rishta he, pataa nahin, lekin bharat ke khilaaf sirf doosraa test khel rahe is khabbu ne na kisi gendbaaj par ankhen tarerin, na hi heroik jescher vaali uchhalkud kii
 Without trying to impress anyone, fielders, spectators, cameras, this fellow played 213 balls out of 560 in Australia's second innings, which is about 40 per cent
 saatven wicket ke rup main jab khwaja mahaj 5 chaukon ke saath 72 ran banaakar out hue to team kaa score 198 pahunch chukaa tha yani total kareeb 250
 It was to be scored on the fourth and fifth days on a Perth-like wicket
 saaf tha ki yah bharat ke liye asambhav nahin to kareeb-kareeb pahunch se baahar ho chukaa tha
 India were largely playing with expectations from Kohli, Cheteshwar Pujara and little Ajinkya Rahane
 or khwaja ke 213 gendon ke mukaable jab ye teenon hi bamushkil 50 genden (thik-thik 51) khel paae to nateeja saaf ho gaya
 Khwaja is a player of the same stature as Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Arvind desilva, Andy Flower Mohammad Yusuf
 
 
 in khiladinnon ko baahar kaa koi bhi glamer lubhaa nahin paata he
 For him, his bat, his game and the cricket field is Khwaja
 ye apana kik apane bheetar hi kahin talashte hai
 The greatest identity of batsmen with this effect is their humble body language
 ve khud ko kisi kii notice main nahin aane dete
 Even the captain of his work should take the captain, take the team, no one takes it, like any Sufi they will keep singing 'tu hi tu, tu hi tu'
 khwaja or pujaara jaise khilaadi har haal main vahi rah pate hai, jo ve hai, ve usase adhik kuch hone se inkaar kar dete hai
 This is Sufism on the field

 Bennett then sent Waters, the fifth World Cup playing Steve Tikolo (two), Obuya and Maurice Ouma (one) to the pavilion

 Oram castigated the lower order

 hameshaa loksabhaa yaa vidhansabha kii kuch siten aisi hoti hai, jo janata kaa mizaaj bayaan karti hai
 Muzaffarnagar and Deoband assembly seats of western UP are considered to be the stronghold of Muslim politics
 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sapa ko musalamaanon kaa ekatarfa samarthan mila tha
 Then Rajendra Rana in Deoband and Chittaranjan Swaroop in Muzaffarnagar had swept the SP with a landslide victory
 musalamaanon kaa aabhaar jataane ke liye sapa mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ne in donon netaaon ko mantri kii kursi di
 But how the situation has changed in four years, these assembly seats are clearly showing it
 rana or swaroop kii asamyik mrityu ke baad farvari main devband or mujffarnagar vidhansabha siton par upachunaav hue
 The SP fielded Rana's wife Meena Rana from Deoband and Swaroop's son Gaurav Swarup from Muzaffarnagar to 'cash' public sympathy
 lekin 16 farvari ko jab upachunaav ke nattejey aae to tasviir kuch badali najar ai
 The SP could not win these two assembly seats again
 is haar ne yah bataa diya ki musalamaanon ke bich sapa kii pakad dhili ho chuki he
 The defeat in Muslim majority seats before the 2017 elections further increased Mulayam Singh Yadav's challenge
 yah chunauti kai morchon se bhi mil rahi he
 The BSP has put a lot of effort to make a dent in the pro-sp Muslim vote bank
 'aal india majalis-e-ittehadul muslemin' (eiemiem) ke rashtriya adhyaksh or saansad asaduddin ovaisi kii upi main chunavi dastak ne bhi sapa ke kaan khadey kar die hai
 In these changed circumstances, Mulayam Singh faces a big challenge to prepare the election-winning equation on Muslim votes for SP in the 2017 assembly elections
 musalmaan bahul siton par upachunaav main mili haar ke fouran baad mulaayam singh ne 2012 ke chunaav main haari hui siton par sapa ummidavaar ghoshit karne kii kavayad shuru kar di
 On 25 March, Mulayam's younger brother and cabinet minister Shivpal Singh Yadav released the list of 142 candidates and started the assembly elections
 is suchi main sabase zyada 28 musalmaan ummidavaaron ko jagah dekar mulaayam singh ne apana chirparichit daanv khel diya he
 akhilesh-mulayam Jugalbandi is weaving some of the same fabric to cut opposition parties in the 2017 assembly elections, as the pair of BJP leaders Amit Shah and Narendra Modi weaved in the last Lok Sabha election
 shah ke hindutv or modi ke vikaas agenda kii jugalbandi ne bijepi ko baari jeet dilaai thi
 Therefore, in the next assembly election, the akhilesh-mulayam pair will put together the development agenda and the muslim-yadav voters
 mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav vot bank kii raajnneeti se dur rahete hue khud ko vikaas purush ke rup main pesh kar rahe hai
 They do not make any separate mention of Muslims or any other caste in their speeches
 pichley dinon jila panchayat adhyaksh or emelsi chunaav main do darjan yuvaaon ko tikat diya gaya, jisamen ek bhi musalmaan nahin tha
 On the other hand, in the book released on the occasion of completion of four years of SP government, only Akhilesh Yadav's development plans have been mentioned
 musalamaanon kaa zikr keval alpsankhyak vibhaag kii yojanaon main hi aayaa he
 On the other hand, Mulayam Singh Yadav sp's core vote banks are focusing completely on Muslims and Yadavs
 baavjood iske yah jugalbandi adhikariyon se apekshit kaam nahin le pai he
 On March 22, Mulayam's pain emerged at a rally in Azamgarh
 ve bole, ''akhilesh mukhyamantri hai, isliye ve iees adhikariyon se cricket match jeet jate hai
 Whereas they should get the officers working by curbing them
 kuch adhikari aise hai, jo meri baton kii andekhi kar mukhyamantri se poochne chale jate hai
 "focus on the West: In the hope of repeating the previous performance in the next assembly elections, the SP has focused on the riot-stricken West UP
 haari hui siton par ghoshit sapa ummidavaaron kii suchi main party kii is ranneeti kii jhalak saaf dikhaai detii he
 The party has fielded Muslim candidates in four losing general seats in Bijnor
 isi prakaar bulandshahr kii teen siton par bhi musalmaan ummidavaaron par daanv lagaaya gaya he
 The SP has put a total of 28 Muslim candidates in its first list
 unamem se 18 pashchimi upi se hai
 Associate Professor in the Economics Department of Meerut College, Dr
 manoj sivaach kehete he, ''loksabhaa chunaav ke baad pashchimi upi main bispi kii sakriyata ne musalmaan matadaataaon kaa sapa se mohabhang kiya he
 The results of the assembly by-election testify this
 musalamaanon ke badale rukh se sakate main ai sapa ab damege control main juty he
 Mulayam is holding meetings with Muslim religious leaders and leaders at his residence
 naam na chhapane kii shart par daarul ulum devband se jude ek shikshak bataate hai, ''mulaayam kuch aise musalmaan netaaon se ghir gaye hai, jinka apane ilaake main koi janaadhar nahin hai
 This is the reason why the real problems of Muslims are not reaching them
 ''iske alaava pashchim ke musalamaanon kii naaraazgi devband ko jila banane, yahaan haj house kii sthapana karne jaise sapa ke vaadon ke ab tak puraa na ho paane ko lekar bhi he
 The displeasure of Muslim religious leaders may also overshadow the SP in an election year
 jama masjid ke shahi imam saiyad ahamed bukhari kaa samarthan paane ke liye sapa ne unke damaad or vidhaan parishad sadsy umr ali khan ko behat se tikat diya he
 On the other hand, the meeting of Shia cleric Kalbe Jawad with Owaisi in Lucknow on March 28 has also given rise to anti-sp Muslim politics
 mood bhaanpane main naakamafarvari main hue vidhansabha upachunaav main sapa pashchimi uttar pradesh kii musalmaan bahul siton kaa mizaaj nahin bhaanp pai
 The results from the sp's stronghold Eastern UP in the election of the vacant 36 seats of the Legislative Council Member (MLC) from the local authority constituency are not encouraging
 6 march ko aae chunaav nateezon main sapa ne bhale hi 30 siton par kabja jamaa liya ho, lekin khantee purvanchal ke jilon ko samahit karne vaali siten gorakhpur-maharajaganj, varanasi-chandauli, gajipur or jonpur seat par mili haar ne rang main bhang kar diya he
 The SP has seven mlas in Jaunpur
 mulaayam singh ke kareebi hone kaa daawa karne vaale parasnath yadav cabinet mantri hai
 But the SP could not sense the atmosphere against Parasnath Yadav in this district and had to repay Khamijaja defeat
 pashchim kii musalmaan bahul siton par upachunaav haarane ke baad bhi sapa emelsi chunaav main sabak na le saki
 In the muzaffarnagar-saharanpur MLC seat sensitive to Muslim voters, the SP could not be seen anywhere
 badhate asantosh ko shant karne ke liye mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne 12 farvari ko pesh bajet main pehali baar purvanchal ke liye ek saath kai badi yojanaayen shuru karne kii ghoshnaa kii

 The M-T-E equation won a majority in the 2012 assembly election by performing sparingly
 isamen pehali baar sapa ke sarvaadhik musalmaan, yadav or dalit ummidavaar vijayi hue the
 Mulayam Singh Yadav has started the social engineering of muslim-thakur-yadav (MTY) to get closer to this performance in the next election

 tas jitkar pehle gendbaaji or ravinder jadeja ko yuvaraj singh se pehle chauthe number par bhejne ke faisle cricket panditon ko raas nahin aaye hai
 Great spinner Irapalli Prasanna said that Harbhajan Singh could have been a better option for number four than Jadeja
 gendbaaji nahin ballebaaji chunani chahie thiunhone kaha itane mahatvapurn match main dhoni ko tas jitkar gendbaaji nahin chunani chaiye thi
 Our batting order was also not right
 jadeja ko yuvaraj or dhoni se pehle bhejnaa bhi galati thi
 In that order, Harbhajan Singh would have been better than Jadeja
 purv wicketiper saiyad kirmani ne kaha ki bharat ke paas virendra sahvaag kaa koi vikalp nahin tha jo kandhe kii chot ke kaaran toornament se baahar ho gaye the
 He said that despite being a strong contender for the title with talent, it happened because we could not perform well at the time
 sahvaag kii kami bhi khali
 Ravinder Jadeja, the weak Kalkirmani said that in this format the opening pair should have played well but it did not happen
 iske alaava jadeja or gautam gambhir kii ballebaaji ke dauraan rangati dhimi pad gai thi
 Former cricketer Arun Lal also questioned Dhoni's captaincy and said sending Jadeja up was a sign of overconfidence and defensive tactics
 purv khilaadi ve bi chandrashekhar ne kaha ki jadeja ko team main hi nahin hona chaiye tha
 He said that Dhoni's decision to field first was wrong
 ravinder jadeja ke pragyan ojha kii jagah chunanaa bhi galati thi
 Harbhajan Singh was also not in the best form
 unhone yah bhi kaha jadeja ko yuvaraj se pehle bhejnaa bhi galati thi kyonki vah toornament main abhi tak khelaa nahin tha
 We were also excessively dependent on the Crown Prince
 vaise yadi yuvaraj nahin chalata to ham toornament se pehle hi baahar ho gaye hote
 The strategy proved to be a bit wrong, but Captain Kapil Dev, who gave India the 1983 World Cup, refused to react to the defeat
 unki maa kaa kuch din pehle hi nidhan hua he
 Former cricketer Madanlal said the target of 154 runs was not difficult
 vaise pehle kshetrarakshan kaa faisla galat nahin tha
 i would have done the same
 mujhe lagata he ki hamaari ranneeti galat sabit hui
 Former selector Chandu Borde denied Dhoni's loss of defeat
 unhone kaha tii20 cricket apratyaashit praaroop he
 Our team looked the best but could not walk
 ishanth mahange sabit hue
 We stopped England for 153 runs but the problem is that there are many stroke players in our team
 unhone kaha hamaare paas aise khilaadi nahin the jo wicket girane par ek morcha sambhaal sake
 Dhoni is a young and intelligent captain but it was a bad day in which his strategy did not yield the expected results

 Then there was a direct contest between Congress and BJP
