 In the second session of the day, more than five Sri Lankan players landed on the ground wearing masks due to pollution
 is par bharat ne kaha ki viraat ne takreeban do din tak ballebaaji kii lekin unhonemaskanhin pahana
 When asked if the Sri Lankan players had to stop the match three times in order to break the rhythm of the Indian players, Bharat said, he probably wanted to focus on pollution
 unka dhyaan shaayad kahin or tha
 May be it breaks our rhythm
 us samay jab match ruka gaya tab ham match jari rakhana chaahate the
 In the second session of the day, when India were on 509 runs losing five wickets, then Sri Lankan bowler Lahiru Gamage got into trouble and stopped playing

 kohli ke jane ke baad ek baar phir khel rukaa 127wein over main srilanka ke team manager asanka gurusanha maidani ampiron se kuch shikaayat karne lage
 After he left the Indian team's head coach Ravi Shastri stepped on the field and spoke to the on-field umpires
 paanch minute tak khel rukne ke baad match ek baar phir shuru hua lekin paanch gend baad srilanka ke captain dinesh chandimal ne 10 khilaadi hone ke kaaran match roak diya or isi bich srilanka team ke coach nik pothas maidan par aakar ampiron se baat karne lage
 Meanwhile, Kohli from the Indian dressing room declared the innings in upset
 bharat ne kaha ki maidan par is tarah khilaadiyon kovirodhakarna sahi nahin rahata kyonki vahaan ampire or referi match kii har sthiti par dhyaan dete hai
 They said
 maidan par jo ampire hote hai or match referi hota he uske liye yah mudda hota he
 The job of the players is not to go and protest
 jab khel bina kisi kaaran ke roka gaya, tab ham chaahate the ki match jari rahe
 Because our focus is on this Test match and we want to win it
 maidan par shastri kii ampiron se kya baat hui is par gendbaaji coach ne kaha, ravi ne saaf taur par kaha tha ki match ko jari rakhen roke nahin
 On the wearing of masks by the visiting team players, Bharat said, Virat batted for two days and he did not need the mask
 hamaara dhyaan us par tha, jo ham karnaa chaahate the
 What we wanted to achieve as a team was completely focused on us
 paristhityaan donon tiimon ke liye ek jaisi thim
 Disturbed by the attitude of the Sri Lankan team, India had declared their innings
 is par bharat ne kaha
 Not in a way because we were paying attention to the score of 550, and we had scored around it, so we thought we should declare the innings

 Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal lost a lot in his two days of unsuccessful agitation
 unka ugr or adiyal ravaiya aam shanti pasand nagarikon ko raas nahin aayaa
 The childish stubbornness he went through to the suspension of the three police personnel cannot be exemplified
 vah jis tarah se apane ko arajak or na jane kya-kya ghoshit kar rahe the, usase lag rahaa tha ki vah loktantr kaa saamaanya shishtachar bhi bhul gaye hai
 His claim of calling millions and filling the Rajpath was just a sample of his ego
 unki party ke is andolan se do dinon tak aam aadmi ko kitni pareshaani hui, uskaa shaayad unhen andaja nahin he or is puri prakriya main unase sahanubhuti rakhane waalon kaa ek bada tabaka dur ho gaya kyonki ve unase apni pareshaaniyon kaa chhutakaara chaahate the lekin unhone unki pareshaani badha di
 However, this movement has come to an end with a small assurance and the lives of Delhiites are back on track
 lekin yah kai sawaal khadey kar gai
 The biggest question that arose was why did he go to such an extent to save his minister? His minister, who is a lawyer by profession, insisted on the midnight arrest of a woman and that too on mere suspicion
 pulicekarmiyon ke khilaaf morcha kholkar arvind kejariwal ne vah sahanubhuti bhi kho di jo unhen duty par maare gaye ek pulicekarmi ke parivaar ko ek karod rupee kii muaavja raashi dekar batori thi
 His party workers were seen shouting slogans against the policemen all the time
 kya kejariwal yah bhul gaye the ki dilli police rajya sarkaar ke adheen nahin he or purv siem shila dikshit party main behad shaktishaalee hote hue bhi nirbhaya cond ke baad tatkaaleen kamishnar niraj kumaar ko hatwa nahin pain
 If he wants to bring Delhi Police inside the state government, he has to get permission from Parliament and it is very difficult
 halaki yah bhi hairaani kii baat he ki rajya kii police rajya sarkaar ke haath main nahin he thik vaise hi yahaan kii zamin sthaneey sarkaar ke haath main nahin he
 Now this movement will be overwhelming for Kejriwal even if his supporters stand with him, but the way all this happened, there was so much uproar and noise that the neutral citizens were forced to think about the party
 yah party abhi shishav avasthaa main he or iske liye jaruri he ki vah aise kadam uthaaen, jisase uske bare main janata kii raay waisi hi rahe jaisi shuru main thi
 There is no place for anarchy in a democratic system
 prashasan kaise chalata he, kejariwal acchhee tarah jaanate hai to phir vah ek arajak netaa kii tarah kyon vyavhaar karne lage? agar unhen lambii pari khelni he to sabase pehle un vaadon kii taraf dhyaan dena hoga jo unhone janata se kiye the
 Forgetting them and talking here and there will question their conscience and the party will move from Jai to decay

 - Adil Ahmed Dar alias Waqas was a young terrorist, so information about him was very less

 jaish kashmiri ladakon ko hi istemaal kar rahaa he taaki javaabi karrwai ke samay vah aasaani se sthiti ko kaabo main laa saken
 Due to the long-running Operation Allout in the valley, the big commanders are gone, so the terrorist organization is recruiting new boys and inciting against Hindustan
 - kyonki vah grad c level kaa yuva aatanki tha, to vah kisi tarah ke shaq ke ghere main bhi nahin aayaa ki ye aatanki itnaa bada hamalaa kar saktaa he
 - Security agencies have become attentive since this attack and are trying to break this new strategy of terrorists

 uddhav thakare kaa shivaji park main shapath grahan samarohshivsena kaa shivaji park se he purana siyaasi nathamumbai kaa shivaji park kaa shivasena se kaaphi purana or gaharaa rishta he
 Balasaheb Thackeray used to roar from the same Shivaji Park to start his political innings and against the establishment of Shiv Sena
 yahi vajah he ki balsahab thakare ke siyaasi vaaris uddhav thakare ne apni tajposhi ke liye shivaji park ko hi chunaa he
 The oath taking ceremony of Uddhav Thackeray will be held at Shivaji Park
 shivasena ke itihaas main shivaji park kaa kaaphi mahatv he
 Because the founder of the party, Bal Thackeray had his first rally in 1966 in this ground
 isi ke baad se balsahab thakare ne is silsile ko jari rakhaa
 Balasaheb Thackeray used to start every election campaign from this ground
 har saal vijaydashami ke din balasaheb thakare isi shivaji park main ek badi raily karte the or vipakshi partiyon ke khilaaf dahaada karte the
 Shiv Sena's first government in the state of Maharashtra was formed in 1995 with the support of BJP
 bal thakare kaa daur tha
 Manohar Joshi became the Chief Minister and the same Shivaji Park was chosen for his coronation
 balasaheb thakare kaa nidhan 17 november 2012 ko nidhan ke hua tha, isi park main unhen mukhaagni di gai thi
 Uddhav Thackeray, who was holding his political legacy after Bal Thackeray, kept his association with Shivaji Park
 isiilie bal thakare kaa smarak shivaji park main banane ke liye shivasena ne apni har takat laga di thi
 The government had also allocated funds for the memorial, but was stayed by the Supreme Court
 darasal chhatrapatishivaji maharaj maharashtra ke itihaas kaa sabase bade kirdaaronmen se ek hai
 Shivaji, who laid the foundation of the Maratha Empire in the 16th century, is worshiped like a god in Maharashtra
 1960 main maharashtra rajya banane ke baad yahaan kii chunavi raajnneeti main chhatrapati shivaji kaa ullekh hameshaa aata rahaa he
 This is the reason that Balasaheb Thackeray had made Shivaji his ideal for the establishment of Shiv Sena
 mughal sultanate kekhilaaf yuddh karne vaale senaanee jaisi shivaji kii 'hindutv vaali' chhavi hameshaa shivasenaor bijepi jaise rajnatik dalon ko acchhee lagi he
 At the same time, the image of the 'maratha' king has proved to be helpful to the parties like congress-ncp to draw the Maratha community of the state towards themselves
 chhatrapati shivaji ke jude muddon par maharashtra main sarkarein bani hai or giri hai
 That is why Shiv Sena has always kept Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at the center of its politics
 bal thakare ke baad uddhav thakare ne shivaji ke saath apane rishte ko majbootee se jode rakhaa he
 That is why Uddhav Thackeray has decided to hold his swearing-in ceremony at Shivaji Park

 unke bare main jaanane se pehle aaie jaane ki is site main he kyabhagava site par clic se bhaagate ditelssbase upar likhaa he bharat ke liye narendra modi kaa plan
 Then it is written that here you can read how if Narendra Modi becomes Prime Minister then he will run this country
 iske baad ek block bana he, jis par likhaa he get ditels
 But as soon as you move the cursor over this block it will move away from its place
 sanket saaf he ki modi ke plan bhi aise hi bhaag jaaenge aapaki pahunch se dur
 On the right side of the site is a photo of Modi wearing a blazer showing his corporate look
 phir kuch aids hai or uske baad is site ko nae sire se shuru karne waalon ne apni pahchaan jaahir kii he
 If some people ignite, then it is the word of peace, which is written by the new web masters of this site in the disclaimer
 isamen likhaa he ki is domen nem par ek site hoti thi, jo vivaadon main aane ke baad delit kar di gai
 We found that this domain name has been orphaned and then decided that an idea should not die out simply because of fear
 hamen nahin pataa ki pehle is site par kya chalata tha
 Just know that some people were very angry with whatever went on
 agar aapkaa is bare main koi vichaar he, to hamen bhejie, use bhi site par rakhaa jayega
 Even if some people are ignited in this turn
 aid se aati he hamaari coffee, shukriyasite chalaane waalon ne apana twitor handle bataakar pahchaan jaahir kii
 Then it is written that our coffee money comes out from the ads appearing on the site
 bahut bahut shukriya
 Alex Gonder is celebrating happinessalex is one of the two operators of this site
 jab unhone is site ko shuru kiya to hits bade, unhone apni website par is khushi ko screen shot daalkar jaahir kiya
 Then someone on Twitter asked them to be prepared to bear the consequences for such absurdity, then he said jokingly, h xxrep 38 a site kii duusari sanchaalak hai vidyut
 She also runs a website named after the public
 jab twitor par logon ne kaha ki aap narendra modi kaa majaak udaakar rahul gandhi kii chapalusee kar rahi hai to chehre par vyangy vaali hansi laate hue vidyut boleen ki haa haa main to rahul se pyaar karti hum na

 aam aadmi party ke sanyojak or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko reman magsese award unke raajnneeti main aane se pehle diya gaya tha
 In 2006, 37-year-old Arvind Kejriwal received the prestigious award on the international stage
 unhen yah puraskaar kejariwal ko do vajahon se diya gaya tha
 One reason was to create awareness and experiment for RTI and another anti-corruption campaign
 kejariwal ne bhrashtachar ke viruddh kaaphi muhim chalaai
 Now Arvind Kejriwal's former colleague Sunil Lal has once again sent him a reminder of the letter written to the awarding institution and demanded that he cancel the Magsaysay award given to Arvind Kejriwal
 sunil laal se jab is sambandh main baat kii gai tab unka kahana tha ki unhone santhaan ko chitthee pichley saal 10 may ko likhi thi lekin abhi tak koi jawaab nahin aayaa he
 Therefore, today, he has sent a reminder to the institute and sought a reply
 baat karne par unka kahana he ki santhaan ne site par likhaa he ki kejariwal ko do vajahon se is puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 One is the fight against corruption and the other is RTI
 laal ne kaha ki jab se dilli main arvind kejariwal ke netritv main sarkaar bani he tab se na to unke apane khaas vibhaag main bhrashtachar kam hua he na hi dilli sarkaar or khaskar unke apane karyaalay main artiai ko lekar koi khaas ruchi he
 He said that the two reasons for which the organization gave him the Magsaysay Award, now that he has come to power, he has failed in both places
 unhone bataaya ki maharashtra anil galgale ne dilli sarkaar main artiai daayar kar vigyaapan par kharche kaa byoraa maanga to mukhyamantri karyaalay ne jaankaree dene se manaa kar diya
 There, Delhi Shailendra Singh also filed an RTI and asked for an answer, so he was not given a reply
 vahiin sunil laal ne kaha ki jahaan tak bhrashtachar kii baat he to yahaan bhi sarkaar puri tarah fail ho gai he
 Recent allegations prove that corruption is prevalent in the Delhi government
 unhone kapil mishra ke zikr karte hue kaha ki ab arvind kejariwal par hi sawaal uth rahe hai
 Along with this, he said that as an IRS, he should have curbed the corruption of the tax department but even today corruption is prevalent in this department
 arvind kejariwal ke iasi se sahyogi rahe sunil laal ne kaha ki maine santhaan ko likhaa he ki aapako jaanchane main galati ho gai he
 When all this is happening under their nose, you should take back the prize
 tippaniyan Sunil Lal was asked if there was any reply from the institute
 tab unka kaha he ki vah jawaab kii apeksha nahin karte
 This is opposition to what he is doing
 sunil laal ne kaha ki meraa bas chale to main philippine main santhaan ke centre ke saamne virodh karne chale jaaen
 Today he has also tweeted in this regard
 saath hi unhone kaha ki unka twitor acount hack kiya ja rahaa he
 They are constantly changing passwords but some mischievous elements are doing this
 sunil laal ne bataaya ki unhone is sambandh main twitor india se shikaayat bhi kii he
 Now Arvind Kejriwal's former colleague Sunil Lal has once again sent him a reminder of the letter written to the awarding institution and demanded that he cancel the Magsaysay award given to Arvind Kejriwal

 saath hi unhone kaha ki unka twitor acount hack kiya ja rahaa he
 They are constantly changing passwords but some mischievous elements are doing this
 sunil laal ne bataaya ki unhone is sambandh main twitor india se shikaayat bhi kii he
 When Sunil Lal was talked about in this regard, he said that he wrote a letter to the institute on May 10 last year, but no response has been received yet
 isliye aaj unhone santhaan ko phir reminder bhej jawaab maanga he
 On talking, he says that the institute has written on the site that Kejriwal was awarded this award for two reasons
 isamen ek bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai he to doosraa artiai
 Lal said that ever since the government was formed in Delhi under the leadership of Arvind Kejriwal, neither corruption has reduced in his own special department nor Delhi government and especially his own office has any special interest regarding RTI
 unhone bataaya ki jin do kaarnon se sanstha ne unhen magsese puraskaar diya tha ab jab vah satta main aae hai donon hi jagahon par ve vifal hai
 He said that Maharashtra Anil Galgale filed an RTI in the Delhi government and asked for the details of expenditure on the advertisement, then the Chief Minister's Office refused to give information
 vahaan dilli shailendra singh ne bhi artiai daayar kar jawaab maanga to unhen bhi jawaab nahin diya gaya
 At the same time, Sunil Lal said that as far as corruption is concerned, here too the government has completely failed
 haal ke aaropon se yah sabit hota he ki dilli sarkaar main bhrashtachar vyaapt he
 Referring to Kapil Mishra, he said that now questions are being raised on Arvind Kejriwal
 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki ek iares hone ke naate unhen tex vibhaag ke bhrashtachar par ankush lagaana chahie tha lekin aaj bhi is vibhaag main bhrashtachar vyaapt he
 Arvind Kejriwal's IAC colleague Sunil Lal said, "I have written to the institute that there has been a mistake in checking you
" jab inaki naak ke neeche yah sab ho rahaa he to aapako puraskaar waapas lenaa chahie
 The comments sunil laal se jab yah poocha gaya ki kya santhaan kii ore se koi jawaab aayaa
 He then states that he does not expect an answer
 yah virodh he jo vah kar rahe hai
 Sunil Lal said that if i just go, then i should go to protest in front of the center of the institute in Philippine
 is sambandh main aaj unhone twit bhi kiya he
 He also said that his Twitter account is being hacked
 ve lagaataar password badal rahe hai lekin kuch shararti tatv yah kaam kar rahe hai
 Sunil Lal said that he has also complained to Twitter India in this regard
 baat karne par unka kahana he ki santhaan ne site par likhaa he ki kejariwal ko do vajahon se is puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 One is the fight against corruption and the other is RTI

 Senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut claimed on Tuesday that his party had laid the foundation of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, so the credit for the construction of the temple does not go to any single party
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne somvaar ko kaha tha ki duniyabar main based bharatiyon kii ichha ke anuroop ayodhya main chaar maheene ke bheetar bhavy ram mandir banegaa
 On Shah's statement, Raut told reporters outside the Maharashtra Vidhan Bhavan, "amit Shah has rightly said that the sky-touching Ram temple will be built
 lekin mandir kii neenv rakhane kaa kaam shivasena ne kiya tha
 "when asked if this means that the credit for the Ram temple goes to the BJP," Raut said, "no, the credit goes to lakhs and crores of kar sevaks including VHP, monks, saints, BJP workers
" 
 shrey kisi ek dal ko nahin balki sabko jaataa he
 Meanwhile, on the second day of the winter session of the state assembly released here, BJP mlas along with the flex board reached the assembly today, which had a report published in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'saamana' for farmers affected by unseasonal rain
 25,000 was demanded
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main raut ne kaha, ‘‘ab vah ‘saamana' padhane ke icchhuk hai lekin satta main rahete hue tatkaaleen mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis lagaataar kehete the ki vah marathi prakaashan nahin padhate
 Raut took a dig at former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, saying, "if he had read 'saamana' while in power, he might have remained in power
 '' After the terrorist attack in Udhampur, it is necessary to know how 'jannat' has been created to create terrorists in Pakistan
 udhampur main pakade gaye aatankwaadi kii tasviir dekhakar sahaj andaja ho jaataa he ki uski umr kitni kam he
 The manner in which he seems to be answering questions in a derisive manner in the released picture of 'mass interrogation' also shows his agelessness
 uski swabhaavik hansi se yah bhi nahin lagata ki use kasaab kii jindagi ke hashr kaa pataa hoga
 After all, what kind of training is given to such youth on a mission of terrorism that they do not even realize how some people of their own countries are going to use them
 kis tarah se unhen maut ke munh main dhakela ja rahaa hai
 As in this case, one partner is killed and the other does not realize that the other has become Kasab
 pakistan main swat or bajore jaise ilaake kaa daura karne ke kram main kuch aisi jaankariyaan milin jo chaunkaane vaali raheen
 One of these is the way to show the life of the terrorists who are prepared for the suicide attacks by going to 'jannat'
 iske liye aatankwaadiyon ke trainer kuch kamaron ke makaan main aisi 'jananath' taiyaar karte hai jinamein khaas taur par kishoravastha ke ladakon ko bahala phusalaakar laayaa jaataa he
 The ceilings of these rooms are blue
 ladakon ke dimag main daalaa jaataa he yah aasmaan he
 Trees and butterflies are made on the upper walls
 yah unke liye haraa bharaa jangal hota he
 There is a flowing stream of water on the lower walls
 yah nadiyaan hoti hai
 The comments nae recruit ko yahaan laakar bataaya jaataa he ki jananath yahi he
 Huron also lives here
 jigyaasa aisi paidaa kii jaati he ki baat jananath main hone vaali hoor par aakar tik jaati he
 Then there are left from one to many 'hur'
 ek noujvaan jo apane sex se jude sapanom ko sach hota dekhtaa he to uskaa uske trainer par bharosa pukhta hota he
 After a few days, he is told that what you have 'bhoga' here is nothing but the real 'paradise is above, if you go there, you will rejoice'
 jaahir he aisi baton main bharosa paalane vaale ladke isliye bhi mil jate hai kyonki pakistan main shiksha kii ghor kami he, khaas taur par aatankwaad grast ilaakon main
 No ray of modern education has ever reached those areas
 vahaan kaa bachapan ek khaas tarah kii mazahabi shiksha kaa shikaar rahaa he
 The thoughtless teenagers there only have to live in their body-building needs and their mind-boggling fantasies
 usee ke aasapaas aatankwaad ke mastermind apana tanabana bunate hai
 Prepare a feed squad
 iske liye aisa aatmghaatee jacket bhi taiyaar kar pahanaate hai jisamen unke sharir kaa 'khaas hissaa' bachaa rahe taaki upar kii 'jananath' main ve aish kar saken! Seeing the picture of terrorist caught in Udhampur, it is easy to guess how young he is
 usase 'samuhik poochtacha' kii jari tasviir main vah jis tarah se betkalluf andaaz main sawaalon ke jawaab detaa dikh rahaa he, usase bhi uski umr kaa allhadpan jaahir hota he
 His natural laughter does not even make him think that he will know the fate of Kasab's life
 aakhir kis tarah kii training di jaati he aatankwaad ke mishan par nikle aise naujavaanon ko ki unhen ehsaas bhi nahin hota ki unke apane mulq ke kuch log kis tarah se unka istemaal karne ja rahe hai
 How they are being pushed to death
 jaise ki is cese main, ek saathi maaraa gaya he or duusare ko ehsaas nahin ki vah doosraa kasaab ho gaya he
 In order to visit areas like Swat and Bajaur in Pakistan, some such information was found that was shocking
 inamen se ek he fidaayin hamalon ke liye taiyaar kiye jane vaale aatankwaadiyon ko 'jananath' main jaakar vahaan kii jindagi dikhaane kaa tarika
 For this, the trainers of the terrorists prepare such 'jannat' in the house of some rooms, in which the adolescent boys are specially lured
 in kamaron kii chhaten nile rang kii hoti hai
 It is the sky that is inserted in the boys' minds
 upree deevaaron par ped-paudhe or titliyaan baniin hoti hai
 It is a green forest for them
 nichali deevaaron par pani kii bahati dhara hoti he
 These are rivers
 tippaniyan The new recruit is brought here and told that this is the paradise
 huuren bhi yaheen basati hai
 Curiosity is created in such a way that it gets fixed on the hurray in heaven
 phir vahaan ek se lekar kai 'hoor' tak chhod di jaati hai
 a young man who sees his sex-related dreams come true reinforces his trust in his trainer
 kuch dinon ke baad use bataaya jaataa he ki jo tumne yahaan 'bhoga' he vah to kuch bhi nahin, asal 'jananath to upar he, vahaan jaaoge to aish karoge'
 It is obvious that boys who believe in such things are also found because there is a severe lack of education in Pakistan, especially in the areas where there is terrorism
 un ilaakon main aadhunik shiksha kii koi kiran kabhi pahunchi hi nahin
 There childhood has been the victim of a special kind of religious education
 vahaan ke alhad kishoron ko sirf apni sharir main panpi jaruraton or dimag kii gadhi fantasiyon main jeena hota he
 Around that, the masterminds of terrorism weave their way
 fidaayin dasta taiyaar karte hai
 For this we also prepare such suicidal jackets in which a 'special part' of their body is saved so that they can rejoice in the 'jannat' above! aakhir kis tarah kii training di jaati he aatankwaad ke mishan par nikle aise naujavaanon ko ki unhen ehsaas bhi nahin hota ki unke apane mulq ke kuch log kis tarah se unka istemaal karne ja rahe hai

 After the Pulwama attack, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan is seen to be surrounded in his country due to the double attitude towards action against terrorists

 Now Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has been targeted by the opposition there
 pakistan pipuls party (PPP) ke adhyaksh bilaval bhutto jaradaari ne neshnal essembly main bolte hue imran khan par nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said how it is possible that the elected Prime Ministers are hanged, but the accused organizations cannot be banned
 is tarah kii karrwai sirf vipaksh ke khilaaf hi hoti he, lekin pratibandhit sanghathanon ke khilaaf koi jaanch nahin ho rahi he
 a joint investigation team is formed for my breakfast, but a probe team is not formed for banned organizations
 bilaval bhutto ne yah baat pakistan kii sansad main kahi
 How is it possible that we hang elected prime ministers but we can't banned orgs on trial? There is ehtesab only for the opposition but none for the banned orgs - There can be a JIT on my breakfast but there cannot be a JIT on banned orgs: Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in Parliamentpic

 According to media reports, Pakistan has banned jamaat-ud-dawa and falah-e-insaniyat Foundation within hours of detention of 44 terrorists, including two brothers of Jaish gangster Masood Azhar due to all-round diplomatic pressure
 4 march ko hi pakistan ne JUD ko watchlist main rakhaa tha, lekin ek din ke bheetar hi use bain kar diya
 The ban on these two organizations of Mumbai terror attack perpetrator Hafiz Saeed was lifted a few days ago
 hafiz said in donon sanghathanon ke jariye kareeb 300 dharmik shikshan santhaan or skool, aspataal, publicing house or ambulance sarvice chalaata he
 In Pakistan even before this, the Jamat-ud Dawa has been banned for many times, but many times it has gone to court against the government's decision
 hafiz said ko sanyukt raashtra ne aatanki ghoshit karte hue us par 10 million dollar ke inaam kaa elaan kiya tha
 Lashkar was banned in 2012

 In Delhi, the Congress has now been handed over from Ajay Maken to former Chief Minister Sheila Dixit
 lagaataar 15 saal mukhyamantri pad par baithkar dilli chalaane kaa unhen anubhav to he hi, saath hi shila dikshit pehle bhi sanghathan kaa kaam kar chuki hai
 Talking exclusively till date, Sheila Dikshit said that she will play the full responsibility given to her by the Congress Party, but this time the Congress Party has come out with a new formula
 is baar ek pradesh adhyaksh ke saath 3 kaaryakari pradesh adhyaksh bhi banaae gaye hai
 The 3 working presidents who have been appointed along with Sheila Dixit, especially the confluence of both the young and the experienced
 shila dikshit khud behad anbhavi hai or unke saath hi mantralay chalaane vaale varisht congressi netaa harun yusuf ko kaaryakari adhyaksh kaa pad diya gaya he
 Dalit leader Rajesh Lithoria has also been given the post of executive chairman, but most of the eye is on Devendra Yadav as he is the youngest and is considered to be Rahul Gandhi's team
 darasal, beete dinon congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne dilli se tejatarraar netaa or congress ke vidhayak rahe devendra yadav ko akhil bhartiya rashtriya congress main sachiv kaa pad dekar rajasthan kaa prabharee banaaya tha
 Since the results, there were speculations that a young man could be given command in Delhi, in such a situation, Devendra Yadav will play a big role along with Sheila Dixit
 puraane congressi bhi hue sakriyaitna hi nahin shila dikshit ke dilli ke adhyaksh banate hi kai puraane congressi jo beete kai maheenon se niskriy najar aa rahe the, wo achaanak se active ho gaye
 Sheila Dixit's house in Nizamuddin East, Delhi, was seen by all the Congress leaders who were usually seen during Sheila Dixit's rule

 But the ruling party refused to take action against the former Prime Minister and the Congress leadership, saying that the law would do its job
 soochna evam prasaaran mantri prakaash javdekar ne kaha, 'purv kaig ke rahasyodghatan se hamaari is raay kii pushti hui he ki seedbluji, 2ji spactrum, jijaji (rabart wadra bhoomi vivaad), koyala blaak aavanton or air india jaise hue bade ghotaalon kii tatkaaleen pradhanmantri ko jaankaree thi
 ' unhone in bhrashtacharon main congress netritv ko bhi lapetate hue kaha, 'samprag shashan main satta kaa vibhaajan tha
 The Congress leadership also cannot escape the accountability of corruption, because everyone knows that Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister, but the power was near 10 Janpath (sonia Gandhi's residence)
 vahaan se pradhanmantri ke paas chitthee aati thi
 ' yah puche jane par ki aise main kya bhaajapa kii aguwai vaali narendra modi sarkaar manmohan singh or congress netritv yaa anya doshiyon ke khilaaf karrwai karegi, soochna evam prasaaran mantri ne kaha, 'ye maamle adaalaton main hai

 According to him 'it was the responsibility of the then Prime Minister
 ek ke baad ek bhrashtachar ke itane maamle hue or aap kehete hai ki mujhe kuch nahin maaloom, aisa nahin ho saktaa
 As such it is a serious revelation
 ' Describing Vinod Rai as a very successful CAG, the minister said that he exposed many irregularities
 unhone kaha, koyala aavanton main bhrashtachar ke bare main unhone (javdekar ne) hi shikaayat kii thi, jiske baad sibiai ne jaanch kii
 The former CAG has criticized Singh in an interview
 unhone kaha he ki unka maananaa he ki singh pehle aao pehle paao ke aadhaar par 2ji spectrum ke aavanton or bina nilaamee ke koyala blaak aavanton sambandhi faislon kaa hissaa the
 Rai has said, '
 
 He (singh) cannot escape his responsibility in 2G and coal (block allocation) cases
 2ji ke sambandh main e raja (tatkaaleen doorsanchaar mantri) ne sabhi patr unhen (singh ko) likhe or unhone un sabakaa jawaab diya

 darasal, maharashtra main koprdi balaatkaar ghatana ke baad har jile main maratha samaaj ke morche nikal rahe hai
 The Chief Minister's statement should be seen by adding reference to it
 koprdi cond kii peedit maratha thi
 Whereas, the oppressed Dalits
 is ghatana ke baad atyaachaar karne waalon ko faansee dene kii maang lekar har jile main maratha sadakon par utar rahe hai
 In this movement, there is also a demand for the removal of the Dalit Atrocity Ban i
e
 the Atrocity Act
 maratha maharashtra kii shaasha jamaat he, jaise uttar pradesh main thakur yaa varna vyavastha main kshatriya
 The front line of lakhs of Maratha caste people with 32 per cent population in Maharashtra has continued in Maharashtra in the last months
 maharashtra kii aabaadi main 2 fisadi hissaa rakhane vaale brahman aabaadi kaa mukhyamantri hona bhi is andolan kii vajah bataaya ja rahaa he
 While answering the question asked in this context, the Chief Minister has given a statement related to his political stability
 tippaniyan In his interview, Chief Minister Fadnavis clearly stated that Maratha agitators are persecuted not by the current political leadership of Maharashtra but by the leadership of their own society
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) lekin, aisa hua bhi to jo bhi nayaa aayega vah bhi kuch turant na kar sakegaa
 Because the questions of Maratha society have been raised because of the Maratha leaders who remained in power for the last 15 years and not because of them
 unhone yaad dilaayaa ki mukhyamantri kii kursi par baithkar unhen do saal bhi puure nahin hue hai
 In fact, after the Kopardi rape incident in Maharashtra, Maratha society fronts are coming out in every district
 jiskaa sandarbh jodakar mukhyamantri ke bayaan ko dekha janaa chahie
 The Maratha victim of the Kopardi scandal was Maratha
 jabaki, atyaachaar karne vaale dalit
 After this incident, Marathas are descending on the roads in every district demanding to hang the tortured people
 is andolan main dalit atyaachaar pratibandh arthath atrocity kanoon ko hataane kii maang bhi ho rahi he
 Maratha is the ruling Jamaat of Maharashtra, like Thakur in Uttar Pradesh or Kshatriya in Varna system
 maharashtra main 32 fisadi aabaadi rakhane vaale maratha jati ke logon ke lakhon kii taadaad ke morche pichley maheenon main maharashtra main jari he
 Being the chief minister of the Brahmin population, which accounts for 2% of the population of Maharashtra, is also being cited as the reason for this movement
 is sandarbh main puche sawaal par jawaab dete hue mukhyamantri ne apni raajnneetik sthirataa se judaa bayaan diya he
 The comments apane saakshaatkaar main mukhyamantri fadanvis ne spasht rup se kaha ki maratha andolankaaree maharashtra ke maujuuda raajnneetik netritv se nahin balki unhi ke samaaj ke netritv se sataae hue hai

 Bangla culture resurfaces in the stories of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore
 us samay kaa bengal or uske sanskaar, reeti-rivaaj, samaaj sab jhaankate hai
 His stories are said to be popular despite being the best and being the best
 rabindranath kii kahaniyaan amar sonar bangala vaale jaadui bengal- visheshkar gramin bengal ko hamaare saamne saakaar kar detii hai
 The protagonists of his stories are idealistic heroines, and teach their love, ideals, values, principle sacrifices and emanations
 apni kahaniyon main rabindranath anupam hai
 In the field of Bengali language and Bengal story, no one has met him before and even after him the feeling is rare
 apni kahaniyon main kalpana ke sajiv chithran se vah vishaal maanavtaa ke durlabh drishy khinchate hai
 His best stories are hard to count, yet 'trespassing', 'master saab', 'postmaster', 'living and dead', 'kabuliwala', 'midnight', 'bizarre rock', 'guest', ' Durasha ',' parrot-kahani 'and' Aparichita 'have a special place among the readers
 aaj unki jayanti par unki anginat kahaniyon main se ek chuni hui shreshth kahanehkahanemparichita- rabindranath tagoreaj meri aayu keval sattaees saal kii he
 This life is neither big in terms of longevity, nor in terms of quality
 to bhi iskaa ek vishesh mulya he
 It is like a flower with a bruise on its chest, and the history of the same footsteps has taken the shape of a kernel in the fruit of its life
 vah itihaas aakaar main chota he, use chota karke hi likhuunga
 Those who do not forget to consider the younger as ordinary will understand its essence
 college main paas karne ke liye jitani parikshaayen thim sab maine khatm kar lee hai
 In childhood, Panditji had a chance to laugh with me by comparing me with the beautiful flower and the Makal fruit (beautiful from outside and a foul-smelling and inedible pudding)
 tab mujhe isse badi lajja lagati thi; kintu bade hone par sochataa rahaa hum ki yadi punarjanm ho to mere mukh par surup or panditji ke mukh par vidrup isi prakaar prakat ho
 There was a day when my father was poor
 vakaalat karke unhone bahut-sa rupaya kamaaya, bhoga karne kaa unhen pal-bhar bhi samay nahin mila
 The long breath he took at the time of his death was his first holiday
 us samay meri avasthaa kam thi
 i was raised by my mother
 maa garib ghar kii beti thim; at: ham dhani the yah baat na to ve bhuulatin, or na mujhe bhuulane deteen
 As a child, i always lived in my lap, so that is why i did not become fully adult till the end
 aaj bhi mujhe dekhne par lagegaa jaise main annapurna kii god main gajanan kaa chota bhai houn
 My real parents were my uncles
 ve mujhase mushkil se chha: varsh bade honge
 But, like Falgu's sandbar, he absorbed all our family into his heart
 unhen khode bina is parivaar kaa ek bhi boond ras paane kaa koi upaay nahin
 That is why i do not have to worry about anything
 har kanya ke pita sweekaar karenge ki main satpaatr hum
 Don't even drink hookah
 bhala aadmi hone main koi jhanjhat nahin he, at: main nitant bhalamanas hum
 i have the ability to walk by obeying my mother's order - in fact, i do not have the ability to disobey
 main apane ko ant:poor ke shasnanusaar chalane ke yogya hi bana sakaa hum, yadi koi kanya swayanvara ho to in sulakshanon ko yaad rakhe
 My marriage proposals came from big houses
 kintu mere mamaa kaa, jo dharti par mere bhagya devtaa ke pradhan agent the, vivaah ke sambandh main ek vishesh mat tha
 He did not like Amir's daughter
 hamaare ghar jo ladki aae vah sir jhukaae hue aae, ve yahi chaahate the
 Even then, there was attachment towards the rupee in his vein
 ve aisa samadhi chaahate the jiske paas dhan to na ho, par jo dhan dene main truti na kare
 Which can be exploited, but one who does not have to listen to the complaint of giving tobacco in a hookah instead of jaggery (jaggery hookah is considered more respectable, tied hookah is a minor hookah)
 meraa mitra harish kanpur main kaam karata tha
 During the holidays, he came to Calcutta and made my mind fickle
 bolaa, suno ji, agar ladki kii baat ho to ek acchhee-khaasi ladki he
 M
 just a few days ago
 e
 Had been passed
 saamne jitani dur tak drushti jaati, chuttee dhu-dhu kar rahi thi; pariksha nahin he, ummidavaari nahin, naukari nahin; apni jaaydaad dekhne kii chintaa bhi nahin, shiksha bhi nahin, ichha bhi nahin- hone main bheetar maa thim or baahar mamaa
 In the desert of this holiday, my heart was looking at the world-like female girl at that time - she had a vision in the sky, her selflessness in the air, her mysterious things in the taro-marmar
 aise main hi harish aakar bolaa, agar ladki kii baat ho to
 My body and mind began to weave a piece of sunshine and shade like the Navpallava-zodiac of Bakul forest, stirring with spring breeze
 harish aadmi tha rasik, ras undelkar varnan karne kii usamen shakti thi, or meraa man tha trirshatt
 i told Harish, go and talk to your maternal uncle once! Harish was unique during the meeting
 isse sarvatra uski khatir hoti thi
 Mama also did not want to leave her after getting it baat unki baithak main chali
 The information about the girl's father was more important to her than the girl
 pita kii avasthaa ve jaisi chaahate the waisi hi thi
 Once upon a time, Mars of Lakshmi was very full in their lineage
 is samay use shunya hi samajho, phir bhi tale main thodaa-bahut baaki tha
 Considering that it was not easy to protect the dignity of the dynasty in their province, they were going to live in the west
 vahaan garib grihasth kii hi bhaanti rahete the
 They had no one except a girl
 atev usee ke peeche lakshmi ke ghat ko ekadam aundha kar dene main hichkichaahat nahin hogi
 It was all beautiful
 kintu, ladki kii aayu pandrah kii he yah sunakar mamaa kaa man baari ho gaya
 Is there any fault in the dynasty? No, no blame - the father cannot find a groom worthy of his daughter anywhere
 ek to var kii haat main manhagaai thi, tis par dhanush-bhang kii shart, at: baap sabar kiye baithe hai, -kintu kanya kii aayu sabar nahin karti
 Whatever, Harish's virtue was in the composition of Saras, the maternal uncle's mind softened
 vivaah kaa bhoomika-bhaag nirvighn puraa ho gaya
 The rest of the world outside of Calcutta, everyone considered their maternal uncle within the Andaman Islands
 jivan main ekbar vishesh kaam se ve konnagar tak gaye the
 If Mama had been Manu, he would have completely prohibited crossing the Howrah Bridge in his Samhita
 man main ichha thi, khud jaakar ladki dekh aauun
 But could not dare to propose
 kanya ko aashirwad dene (bengaaliyon main vivaah pakkaa karne ke liye ek rasm hoti he- jisamen var-paksh ke log kanya ko or kanya-paksh ke log var ko aashirwad dekar koi aabhushan de jate hai) jinako bheja gaya ve hamaare vinu dada the, mere fuphere bhai
 i could depend on his opinion, interest and efficiency at sixteen
 lautakar vinu dada ne kaha, buree nahin he ji! asli sona he
 Vinu Dada's language was very moderate
 jahaan ham kehete the 'apurv', vahaan ve kehete 'kaamchalaoo'
 Therefore, i understood, in my fate, Panchshar has no opposition from Prajapati
 2kahana vyarth he, vivaah ke uplakshya main kanya paksh ko hi kalakatta aana padaa
 The proof of how much Kanya's father Shambhunath Babu believed in Harish was that he saw me for the first time three days before the marriage and completed the ritual of blessing
 unki avasthaa chalis ke hi aas-paas hogi
 The hair was black, the mustache ripening had just begun
 rupavaan the, bheed main dekhne par sabase pehle unheen par najar padane laayak unka cheharaa tha
 Hope they were happy to see me
 samajhnaa kathin tha, kyonki ve alpbhaashi the
 Even those who said a few things, as if they did not insist on it
 is bich mamaa kaa munh abaadh gati se chal rahaa tha- dhan main, maan main hamaara sthaan shahar main kisi se kam nahin tha, ve naanaa prakaar se isi kaa prachaar kar rahe the
 Shambhunath Babu did not give any yoga in this matter - in any context, no 'yes' or 'am' was heard
 main hota to nirutsahit ho jaataa, kintu mamaa ko hatotsahit karnaa kathin tha
 Seeing the calm nature of Shambhunath Babu, he thought that the man is absolutely lifeless, not too sharp
 samadhiyon main or jo ho, tej bhav hona paap he, atev, man-hi-man mamaa khush hue
 When Shambhunath Babu woke up, the maternal uncle briefly left him from above, did not go to sit in the car
 dahej ke sambandh main donon pakshon main baat pakki ho gai thi
 Mama was proud to consider herself as an exceptionally clever
 baatcheet main ve kahin bhi koi chhidr na chhodte
 The number of rupees was definitely fixed, how much the jewel was filled from above and the rate of gold, it was also completely decided
 main swayan in baton main nahin tha; na jaanata hi tha ki kya len-dein nishchit hua he
 i knew that this gross part is a major part of marriage; And the weight of the fraction which is on top of them will not cheat even a penny
 vastut: atyant chatur vyakti ke rup main mamaa hamaare saare parivaar main garv kii pradhan vastu the
 Wherever we have a relationship, the mountain will win in the battle of wisdom, it was absolutely certain
 isliye hamaare yahaan kabhi na rahane par bhi evam duusare paksh main kathin abhaav hote hue bhi ham jeetenge, hamaare parivaar kii jid thi- isamen chaahe koi bache yaa mare
 The ceremony of offering turmeric was done with great pomp
 dhone vaale itane the ki unki sankhya kaa hisaab rakhane ke liye clerk rakhana padataa
 Remembering the inferior side that will take place in leaving them, the mother laughed a lot after mixing the voice with the maternal uncle
 band, shehanai, fansy concert aadi jahaan jitne prakaar kii joardaar awaajen thim, sabko ek saath milakar barbar kolahal rupi mast hathi dwaara sangeet saraswati ke parvinn ko dalit-vidalit karata hua main vivaah ke ghar main ja pahunchaa
 With rings, necklaces, brocades, jewels, my body looked as if the jewelry store had gone to auction
 unke bhavi jamaata kaa mulya kitna tha yah jaise kuch maatra main sarvang main spasht rup se likhakar bhavi sasur ke saath muqabla karne chalaa tha
 Mama was not happy on reaching the marriage house
 ek to angan main baratiyon kai baithne ke laayak jagah nahin thi, tis par sampurna aayojan ekadam saadhaaran dhang kaa tha
 Shambhunath Babu's behavior from above was also extremely cold
 unki vinay ajasr nahin thi
 There were no words in the mouth
 baithe gale, ganji khopadi, krishnavarna evam sthool sharir vaale unke ek vakil mitra yadi qamar main chadar baandhe, baraabar haath jode, sir hilaate hue, namratapurna smitahaasya or gadgad vachanon se concert party ke kartaal bajaane vaale se lekar varkarta tak prayek ko baar-baar prachur maatra main abhishikt na kar dete to shuru main hi maamla is paar yaa us paar ho jaataa
 Shortly after sitting in my meeting, maternal uncle Shambhunath called Babu to the next room
 pataa nahin, kya baaten huin
 After some time, Shambhunath Babu came and said to me, Lalaji, just come here! 'the matter was this - not everyone, but some people have one goal in life
 mamaa kaa ekmaatr lakshya tha- ve kisi bhi prakaar kisi se thage nahin jaaenge
 He feared that his relatives might betray him in jewels - there would be no retaliation for that betrayal when the marriage is over
 ghar-kiraaya, saugat, logon kii vidaai aadi ke vishay main jis prakaar kii kheenchaatani kaa parichay mila usase mamaa ne nishchay kiya tha- lene-dene ke sambandh main is aadmi kii keval jabaani baat par nirbhar rahane se kaam na chalegaa
 That is why even the goldsmiths of the house were brought together
 bagal ke kamare main jaakar dekha, mamaa ek kursi par baithe the
 a goldsmith on the ground with his scales, weights and test etc
 shambhunath babu ne mujhase kaha, 'tumhaare mamaa kehete hai ki vivaah-kaary shuru hone ke pehle hi ve kanya ke saare gahane janchavaa dekhenge, isamen tumhaari kya raay he?'main sir nicha kiye chup rahaa
 Mama said, 'what will he say
 main jo kahuunga, vahi hoga
 'shambhunath Babu looked at me and said,' Then it was decided? What will they say? You have nothing to say in this regard? ”I shook my neck and pointed,“ i have absolutely no right in all these things
 ''acha to baitho, ladki ke sharir se sara gahanaa utarkar laata hum
 He woke up saying
 mamaa bole, 'anupam yahaan kya karegaa? vah sabha main jaakar baithe
 'shambhunath said,' No, not in the meeting, have to sit here
 'kuch der baad unhone ek angoche main bandhe gahane laakar chaowkee ke upar bicha die
 All the ornaments were of his grandfather's time, the new fashion was not a fine work - it was as heavy as it was thick
 sunar ne haath main gahane uthaakar kaha, 'inhen kya dekhuun
 There is no adulteration in it - such gold is not practiced nowadays
 'yah kehete hue usne makar ke munh vaala motaa ek bala kuch dabaakar dikhaaya, vah tedha ho jaataa tha
 At the same time, Mama made a list of jewels in the note-book - somewhere that nothing should be reduced from what was shown
 hisaab karke dekha, gahanaa jis maatra main dene kii baat thi inaki sankhya, dar evam tol usase adhik thi
 There was a pair of earrings in the jewelry
 shambhunath ne usko sunar ke haath main dekar kaha, 'jaraa isaki pariksha karke dekho!'sunar ne kaha, 'yah vilayati maal he, isamen sone kaa hissaa maamuli hi he
 Shambhu Babu gave the earling pair to Mama's hand and said, 'keep it to yourself!' Mama took it in her hand and saw the earring girl, who had completed the blessing ceremony
 mamaa kaa cheharaa laal ho uthaa, daridr unako thagna chahega, kintu ve thage nahin jaaenge is anand-prapti se vanchit rah gaye, evam iske atirikt kuch upree prapti bhi hui
 Mouth said very heavily, 'anupam, go you sit in the assembly!' Shambhunath Babu said, 'no, now you will not have to sit in the assembly
 chaliye, pehle aap logon ko khilaa duun
 'mama said,' what are you saying? Lagna
 
 
 'shambhunath babu ne kaha, 'uske liye chintaa na karen- abhi uthie!'aadmi nihaayat bhalamanas tha, kintu andar se kuch zyada hathi prathit hua
 Mama had to get up
 baratiyon kaa bhi bhojan ho gaya
 There was no fanfare in the event
 kintu rasoi acchhee bani thi or sab-kuch saaf-suthra
 This made everyone satisfied
 baratiyon kaa bhojan samaapt hone par shambhunath babu ne mujhase khaane ko kaha
 Mama said, 'what are you saying? How will the bride eat before marriage? ”in this regard, he ignored my uncle's opinion and looked at me and said,“ What do you say? Is there any fault in sitting for food? ’murtimati maternal-commanded form uncle was present, it was impossible for me to walk against him
 main bhojan ke liye na baith sakaa
 Then Shambhunath Babu said to the maternal uncle, 'you have given a lot of trouble to you people
 ham log dhani nahin hai
 You could not make arrangements worthy of the people, sorry
 raat ho gai he, aap logon kaa ksht or nahin badhanaa chahta
 Then this time-uncle said, 'so, let's go to the meeting, we are ready
 'shambhunath bole, 'tab aapaki gaadi bulavaa duun?'mamaa ne aashcharya se kaha, 'majaak kar rahe hai kya?'shambhunath ne kaha, 'majaak to aap hi kar chuke hai
 i do not wish to end the joke contact
 'mamaa donon ankhen visfaarit kiye awak rah gaye
 Shambhunath said, 'I will steal the jewel of my daughter, who thinks this, i cannot give a girl to her hands
 'mujhase ek shabd kahana bhi unhone aavashyak nahin samajha
 The reason, as it was attested, i was nothing
 uske baad jo hua use kehane kii ichha nahin hoti
 By breaking the chandelier, destroying and destroying the thing, the party of the Baratis came out after completing the drama of daksha-yajna
 ghar lautne par band, shehanai or concert sab saath nahin baje evam abhrak ke jhaadon ne akaash ke taron ke upar apane karttavya kaa nirvaah karke kahaan mahanirvana praapt kiya, pataa nahin chalaa
 3 All the people of the house were enraged
 kanya ke pita ko itnaa ghamand kaliyug purna rup se aa gaya he
 Everyone said, see how to marry a girl
 kintu, ladki kaa vivaah nahin hoga, yah bhay jiske man main na ho usko dand dene kaa kya upaay he?bengal-bhar main main hi ekmaatr purush tha jisko swayan kanya ke pita ne janavaase se lautaa diya tha
 Which evil planet stole such a big stain of stigma on the forehead of such a big satpatra, with so much publicity and celebrating with gazes and instruments? Barati started beating his head saying that the marriage did not happen, but fed us by cheating - regret would have been erased if he had taken away the pancreas with the whole grain
 'vivaah ke vachan-bhang kaa or maan-haani kaa daawa karuunga,' kahkar mamaa gum-ghumkar khub shor machaane lage, hitaishiyon ne samajha diya ki aisa karne se jo tamaasha baaki rah gaya he vah bhi puraa ho jayega,kahana vyarth he, main bhi khub krodhit hua tha, 'kisi prakaar shambhunath buree tarah harkar mere pairon par aa gire,' muunchon kii rekha par taav dete-dete keval yahi kaamana karne laga
 But, another source was flowing near the black stream of this outrage, whose color was not black at all
 sampurna man us aparichit kii ore daud gaya
 Still could not turn her back in any way
 diwaar kii aad main rah gaya
 Sandalwood was discussed on his forehead, red saree on his body, shame on his face, how can i tell what was in the heart! The imagination of my fantasy was bent to request me to load all the flowers of spring
 hawa aa rahi thi, sugandh mil rahi thi, patton kaa shabd sun rahaa tha- keval ek pag badhaane kii der thi- isi bich vah pag-bhar kii duuri kshan-bhar main aseem ho gai
 For so long, i went to Vinu Dada's house every evening and troubled him
 vinu dada kii varnan-style kii atyant saghan sankshiptata ke kaaran unki prayek baat ne sphulling ke samaan mere man main aag laga di thi
 i understood that the girl's appearance was very unique; But neither saw him eyes nor his picture, everything remained unclear
 baahar to usne pakad di hi nahin, use man main bhi na laa sakaa- isi kaaran bhoot ke samaan deergh nirishwaas lekar man us din kii us vivaah-sabha kii diwaar ke baahar chakkar kaatane laga
 Heard from Harish, the girl was shown my photograph
 pasand avashya kiya hoga
 There was no reason not to do it
 meraa man kahata he, vah chitra usne kisi baks main chipa rakhaa he
 Would she not have opened it in some lonely mid-afternoon, closing the door of the room? When you look down at the top of the picture, won't the open hair come from both sides of your face? Suddenly when she could find someone's foot outside, would she not hide the picture in her fragrant lapel? Days passed
 ek varsh biit gaya
 The maternal uncle would not be able to talk about marriage with shame
 maa kii ichha thi, mere apmaan kii baat jab samaaj ke log bhul jaaenge tab vivaah kaa praytn karengi
 On the other hand i heard that the girl may have got a good groom, but she vowed not to get married
 sunakar man anand ke aavesh se bhar gaya
 i began to visualize, she does not eat well; It is evening, she forgets to tie hair
 uske pita uske munh kii ore dekhte hai or sochate hai, 'meri ladki dinondin aisi kyon hoti ja rahi he?' akasmaat kisi din uske kamare main aakar dekhte hai, ladki ke netra aansuon se bhare hai
 Ask, daughter, what has happened to you, tell me? The girl quickly wipes the tears and says, "where, nothing happened, father!" It is the only girl of the Father - it is very dear girl
 anaavrishti ke dinon main phool kii kali ke samaan jab ladki ekadam murjhaa gai to pita ke praan or adhik sahan na kar sake
 They gave up their honor and came to our door
 uske baad? uske baad man main jo kaale rang kii dhara bah rahi thi vah maano kaale saanp ke samaan rup dharkar phufakaar uthi
 He said, well, once the wedding decorations are decorated, lights are lit, invitations are given to the people of the country and abroad, after that, after crushing the bride's maury with your feet, you get up from the assembly with force
 But the stream, which was as good as the teardrop-water, took the form of flamingo and said, Just like i went to Pushpavan of Damayanti one day, let me fly once - give me happiness and doubt once in the ears of Virhini
 Come iske baad? uske baad du:kha kii raat biit gai, nav varsha kaa jal barasaa, mlaan phool ne munh uthaaya- is baar us diwaar ke baahar sari duniya ke or sab log rah gaye, keval ek vyakti ke bheetar pravesh kiya
 Then my story came to an end
 4lekin kahani aise khatm nahin hui
 i will conclude this article by giving a little description of where she has become infinite
 maa ko lekar tirth karne ja rahaa tha
 The weight was on me, because the maternal uncle did not cross the Howrah bridge even this time
 railgadee main so rahaa tha
 In the mind-pimples, there was a tingling of many kinds of dreams scattered in the mind
 akasmaat kisi ek stesan par jaag padaa, vah bhi prakaash-andhkaar-mishrit ek swapn tha
 Only the stars of the sky were well-known - and all was unfamiliar; Several straight vertical lights of the station were showing how unfamiliar this earth is with the light and how far it is around it
 gaadi main maa so rahi thim; batti ke neeche haraa pardaa tanga tha, trunk, baks, saamaan sab ek-duusare ke upar teetar-bitar pade the
 It was as if it was an inversion of the utopia, which was not known in the way between the absence and absence of the twinkling light of the evening light
 is bich us vicitra jagat kii adbhut raat main koi bol uthaa, jaldi aa jaao, is dibbe main jagah he
 i felt like i had heard the song
 bengali ladki ke mukh se bangala boli kitni madhur lagati he iskaa puraa-puraa anumaan aise anupyukt sthaan par achaanak sunakar hi kiya ja saktaa he
 But, by categorizing this tone as the voice of a girl, it will not work
 yah kisi anya vyakti kaa swar tha, sunate hi man kah uthta he, 'aisa to pehle kabhi nahin suna
 'the tone of the throat has always been a great truth for me
 rup bhi kam badi vastu nahin he, kintu manushya main jo antartam or anirvachaneey he, mujhe lagata he, jaise kanth-swar usee kii akruti ho
 Opening the choppy grille, i pulled my mouth out, i could not see anything
 platform par andhere main khadey guard ne apni ek aankh vaali laalaten hilaai, gaadi chal di; main jungle ke paas baitha rahaa
 There was no idol before my eyes, but in the heart i started to see the form of a heart
 vah jaise is taaramayi raatri ke samaan ho, jo aavruth kar leti he, kintu use pakadaa nahin ja saktaa
 Whatever tone! Tones of unfamiliar jugular! Within a moment you have sat on the seat of my familiar
 tum kaise adbhut ho- chanchal kaal ke kshubdh hriday ke upar ke phool ke samaan khile hon, kintu uski laharon ke andolan se koi pankhudi tak nahin hilti, aparimey komalta main jaraa bhi daag nahin padataa
 The car went on beating the iron moth
 main man-hi-man gaanaa sunata ja rahaa tha
 He had only one take - 'there is space in the compartment
 ' he kya, jagah he kya jagah mili kaise, koi kisi ko nahin pahachaanata
 Also, do not recognize it - it is just fog, maya, and as soon as it is shattered, then the introduction does not end
 o sudhamay swar! jis hriday ke tum adbhut rup ho, vah kya meraa chir-parichit nahin he? jagah he, he, jaldi bulaayaa tha, jaldi hi aayaa hum, kshan-bhar bhi der nahin kii he
 Could not sleep properly in the night
 praaia: har stesan par ek baar munh nikaalkar dekhtaa, bhay hone laga ki jisko dekh nahin paaya vah kahin raat main hi na utar jaae
 On the second day in the morning the train had to be changed at a big station
 Our tickets were of first class - i hope there will be no rush
 utarkar dekha, platform par saahabon ke ardaliyon kaa dal saamaan liye gaadi kii pratiksha kar rahaa he
 One of the army's generals went out for a visit
 do-teen minutes ke baad hi gaadi aa gai
 Understood, first class will have to give up hope
 maa ko lekar kis dabbe main chadh luun, is bare main badi chintaa main pad gaya
 The entire car was crowded
 daravaaje-daravaaje jhaankta hua ghoomane laga
 Meanwhile, a girl from the second class compartment targeted my mother and said, "come to our compartment, there is a place here
" main to chaunk padaa
 The same wonderful melodious voice and the same song's take 'place is' did not delay even a moment and climbed into the box with the mother
 saamaan chadhaane kaa samay praaia: nahin tha
 There will be no one in a world like me unable
 us ladki ne hi kuliyon ke haath se jhatpat chalati gaadi main hamaare bistaraadi khinch liye
 i missed a camera at the station to take photos - i did not notice
 uske baad- kya likhuun, nahin jaanata
 i have a picture of unbroken bliss in my mind - where do i start it, where do i end it? There is no desire to plan one sentence after another
 is baar usee swar ko ankhon se dekha
 Even at that time, that voice came to know
 maa ke munh kii ore taaka; dekha ki unki ankhon ke palak nahin gir rahe the
 The girl will be in the age of sixteen or seventeen, but no one has put any weight on her body, mind, anywhere
 uski gati sahaj, dipti nirmal, saundarya kii shuchita apurv thi, usamen kahin koi jadta na thi
 i see, it is impossible for me to say anything in detail
 yahi nahin, vah kis rang kii sari kis prakaar pahane hue thi, yah bhi thik se nahin kah saktaa
 It is absolutely true that there was nothing in her dress that would particularly attract the eyes except her
 vah apane chaaron ore kii chizon se badhkar thi- rajnigandha kii shubhr manjari ke samaan saral vrunt ke upar sthit, jis vriksh par khili thi uskaa ekadam atikaraman kar gai thi
 There were two or three small girls together, there was no end to her laughter and conversation with them
 main haath main ek pustak liye us ore kaan lagaae tha
 Whatever was falling in the ears was all about childish things with children
 uskaa visheshtv yah tha ki usamen avasthaa kaa antar bilkul bhi nahin tha- chhoton ke saath vah anayas or anandpurvak choti ho gai thi
 Along with there were illustrated books of children's stories - to tell a story of that, the girls had surrounded it, they must have heard this story twenty-twenty-five times
 ladakiyon kaa itnaa aagrah kyon tha yah main samaj gaya
 The gold rod of that sudha-kantha used to make the whole story gold
 ladki kaa sampurna tan-man puri tarah praanon se bharaa tha, uski sari chaal-dhaal-sparsh main praan umad rahaa tha
 So when girls hear the story from her mouth, they listen to it, not the story; The fountain of life falls on his heart
 uske us udbhasith praan ne meri us din kii sari surya-kirnon ko sajiv kar diya; mujhe laga, mujhe jis prakruti ne apane akaash se veshtit kar rakhaa he vah us taruni ke hi aklant, amlan praanon kaa vishwa-vyapee vistaar he
 On arriving at the other station, he called the Khomache and bought a lot of pulses, and together with the girls, began to eat with disdain, doing absolutely childlike banter
 meri prakruti to jaal se ghiri hui thi- kyon main atyant sahaj bhav se, us hansmukh ladki se ek mutthi daal-moth na maang sakaa? haath badhaakar apana lobh kyon nahin sweekaar kiya
 Mother was getting confused between feeling good and bad
 dibbe main main hum mard, to bhi ise koi sankoch nahin, khaskar vah is lobh kii bhaanti kha rahi he
 He did not like this thing; And they did not even have the illusion to call him unconscious
 unhen laga, is ladki kii avasthaa ho gai he, kintu shiksha nahin mili
 Mother suddenly could not talk to anyone
 logon ke saath dur-dur rahane kaa hi unako abhyaas tha
 He had a great desire to get the introduction of this girl, but was not able to remove the natural obstacles
 isi samay gaadi ek bade stesan par aakar ruk gai
 a team of those General Sahab's companions was trying to climb from this station
 gaadi main kahin jagah na thi
 Many times they came out of the front of our compartment
 maa to bhay ke maare jad ho gai, main bhi man main shanti kaa anubhav nahin kar rahaa tha
 Shortly before leaving the car, a native railway-employee hung two stamps with the names on the ends of two coaches of the coaches and told me that, these two coaches of the coaches have already been reserved by the two coaches, you guys got the other coaches
 Have to go in main to jhatpat ghabaraakar khadaa ho gaya
 The girl said in Hindi, no, we will not leave the box
 us aadmi ne jid karte hue kaha, bina chode koi chaara nahin
 However, seeing no signs of descending from the girl, he came down and called the English station-master
 usne aakar mujhase kaha, mujhe khed he, kintu-sunakar maine 'kuli-kuli' kii pukaar lagaai
 The girl got up and started raining with both eyes and said, No, you cannot go, as you are sitting! Standing near the door, she said in English to the station-master, this box is already reserved, this is a lie
 
 yah kahkar usne naam likhe tikaton ko kholkar platform par phenk diya
 In the meantime, Sahab was standing near the door with the orderly dressed Sahib
 dibbe main apana saamaan chadhaane ke liye pehle usne ardli ko ishaara kiya tha
 After that, looking at the girl's mouth, listening to her, seeing Mukhmudra, the station-master hid a little and took him to the boat and did not know what to say
 dekha gaya, gaadi chhootane kaa samay biit chukne par bhi or ek dibba joda gaya, tab kahin train chhuti
 The girl took her plea and started eating dal-moth again, and in shame, i started to look at the beauty of nature by taking my mouth out of the forest
 gaadi kanpur main aakar rukii
 The girl was ready by tying the baggage - an Bengali servant tried to take them off at the station
 tab phir maa se na rahaa gaya
 Asked, what is your name, daughter? Girl said, My name is Kalyani
 sunakar maa or main donon hi chaunk pade
 Your father- He is a doctor here
 His name is Shambhunath Sen
 uske baad hi ve utar gayi
 i have now come to Kanpur, disregarding the prohibition of the epilogue
 kalyani ke pita or kalyani se bhent hui he
 Hands folded, head bowed, Shambhunath Babu's heart melted
 kalyani kahati he, main vivaah nahin karuungi
 i asked, why? She said, Mother's command
 jab ho gaya! is ore bhi maatul hai kya?baad main samajha, matra-bhoomi he
 Kalyani has taken a vow to educate girls since that relationship broke up
 kintu, main aashaa na chhod sakaa
 That voice is still echoing in my heart - as if someone descends from the other side - came from outside my world, calling me outside the whole world
 or, vah jo raat ke andhkaar main mere kaan main padaa tha, 'jagah he,' vah mere chir-jivan ke sangeet kii tech ban gai
 My age at that time was twenty-three, now it is twenty-seven
 abhi tak aashaa nahin chodi he, kintu maatul ko chhod diya he
 Mother could not leave me because she was the only one
 tum soch rahe hoge, main vivaah kii aashaa karata hum
 no never
 mujhe yaad he, bas us raat ke aparichit kanth ke madhur swar kii aashaa- jagah he
 Sure is
 nahin to khadaa hounga? isi se varsh ke baad varsh bitate jate hai- main yaheen hum
 It is an offering, i hear the same voice, when i get an opportunity, i do its work - and the mind says - this is the place, o irreverence! Your introduction is not complete, it will not be complete, but my luck is good, i have got a place

 i told the whole thing in Hindi to Rahul Gandhi
 arvind kejariwal, sharad yadav se lekar jo bhi netaa aate hai, unhen main hi samajhaata hum
 People from the Swaminarayan sect also came
 puure desh se har din pachaas-pachaas ke jhund main dalit samaaj ke log aate hai
 Ten-fifteen such flocks are arriving daily
 mukhyamantri anandiben ne har peedit ko ek-ek lakh rupee diye hai
 Rahul Gandhi has also received a check of five lakh rupees
 maine jitu se poocha ki aap yah ladaai kaise lard paaenge, aapako college bhi janaa hoga
 Hardik Patel had also tried to raise his voice, but what happened to him, will you be able to bear it
 
 
 ? is par jitu ne kaha, "ham apana andolan karenge
 
 
 Whatever happens to me, i will show something for my society
 
 
 apane samaaj ke liye mar bhi gaya to main mar jaaoongaa
 
 
 " jitu ne bataaya ki gaanv ke log bhi aae, kaha, koi zarurat ho to bataanaa, ham puraa karenge, lekin hamaare gaanv main isse pehle koi oonchi jati kaa nahin aata tha
 Whoever came did not enter the verandah of the house
 ghar ke bheetar koi nahin aata tha, baahar hi baithkar chalaa jaataa tha
 Do not drink tea and water in our home's cups and glasses
 tippaniyan"jab ham unke ghar mazaduri karne jate hai, to hamen alag bartan main khaanaa dete hai
 There is a separate glass for us
 gaanv ke mandir main hamen jane kii anumati nahin he
 The people of our family have not even tried that we do not have so much courage
 
 
 " Now the life of Jeetu Sarawaiya has changed
 tamaam akhabaaron or channelon par bade netaaon ke saath uski tasviir aa rahi he
 He has so much understanding
 zindagi uski uske liye nahin badali he, kisi bade uddeshy ke liye badali he
 The last thing while keeping the phone was, "I will raise my voice
" 
 
 " This young man standing in red t-shirt and jeans in front of six women is the lone voice of his four brothers, who you may have seen the video of being beaten up
 22 saal kaa he jitu sirvaiya
 The story of this newcomer from Mota Samdholiya village of Una town in Gujarat also takes us to other realities of Dalit and Indian rural system
 jitu bhavnagar ke shantilal shah garvanment enjinairing kalege main electronic and communication main antim varsh kaa chaatr he
 The college is on, but after leaving studies, he has come to help his cousins
 apane bhaaiyon ko video main berahami se pitate dekh jitu puri tarah badal gaya he
 "now we will never work to remove the dead cow's skin
 
 
 itnaa maar khaaya he ki kisi bhi haalat main nahin karenge
 
 
 Some will work as wages, but they will not work
 
 
 apane gaanv main bhi gaay maregi to bhi mere parivaar se koi nahin uthaane jayega
 
 
 This is our final decision
 
 
 " The rest of the 27 Dalit families of Mota Samdholia work as laborers in the fields
 sirf jitu ke bade papa babu bhai veeraa bhai sirvaiya 25 saal se yah kaam karte hai
 All four of his sons help in this work
 jitu ne bataaya ki aasapaas ke 15-20 gaanvon se phone aata tha ki gaay mari hui he
 From there, my father and my brother used to bring my cow
 ham log garib hai
 i am educated in the family
 "main ejineering chauthe varsh kaa chaatr hum, magar mere ghar main shauchalay nahin he
 
 
 No one in my family has a toilet
 
 
 ham khule khet main jate hai
 
 
 Only one of the 27 Dalit families has their own toilet, which they have built with their own money

 Her father has applied for two years, but the electricity department has not installed the meter
 galat tareeke se conection lene par saadhe saat hazaar kaa jurmaana laga jate hai
 Those in the electricity department do come to impose fines
 jitu ke alaava parivaar main koi padhaa-likhaa nahin tha, jo police se lekar aspataal ke doctoron se baat karata
 If Jeetu had not reached here, he would never have understood the importance of Dalit violence and agitation
 bhaaiyon kii pitayee kaa video dekhne ke baad sirf dalit samaaj ke bare main soch rahaa he
 He has gone to three to four big rallies, given speeches
 is ghatana se pehle jitu ne kabhi aisa iraadaa nahin kiya tha
 He wanted to do something for his family after passing the engineering exam

 Facebook remains in constant discussions regarding the data leak case
 is bich fasebuk ke siio mark jakarberg ne is mudde ko lekar fasebuk par post likhaa he
 In his post, he has told that the company has taken many steps in this matter so far and can take tough steps even further
 jakarberg ne cambridge analitica ke maamle main apni galati kabuuli he
 Zuckerberg wrote that it is our responsibility to keep people's data safe, if we fail in it, then it is our fault
 unhone kaha ki hamane isko lekar pehle bhi kai kadam uthaae the, haalanki hamase kai galtiyaan bhi huin lekin unako lekar kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 He wrote that i started Facebook, if anything happens with it, it is my responsibility
 ham apni galatiyon se seekhney kii koshish karte rahenge, ham ek baar phir aapkaa vishwaas jeetenge
 In his Facebook post, Zuckerberg explained the timeline of the entire case
 jakarberg ne likhaa ki 2007 main hamane fasebuk main kai tarah kii chizon ko apadet kiya
 It included many apps such as friends' birthdays, address books, maps
 iske liye hamane fasebuk yuzar se kuch jaankaree lee, jisamen unke dost koun hai jaisi jaankaree shaamil thi
 In 2013, Alexander Kogan, a researcher at Cambridge University, created a personal quiz app
 jise kareeb 3 lakh logon ne install kiya, isamen kuch personal data kaa bhi upyog kiya gaya
 This not only shared the data of those three lakh people but also many of their friends
 jakarberg ne likhaa ki 2014 main hamane eps or data shering ke tareekon ko puri tarah se badal diya
 After which if any other app asks for the data of a user, then he has to ask the user first
 lekin 2015 main ek akhbaar kii report se pataa laga ki kogan ne ye data cambridge analitaka company ke saath share kiya he
 Which was against the rules
 jiske baad hamane turant hi kogan kii aplication ko fasebuk se bain kar diya
 We asked Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to delete all the users' data and also give its certificate
 kai tarah ke badlaavon kaa elaanjakarbarg ne apane post main likhaa ki pichley hafte main hamen pataa laga ki company ne yugers kaa data delit nahin kiya he
 After which we banned them from using our service
 jakarberg ne apane post main ye bhi bataaya ki vah kis tarah aage aisi data chori kii ghatnaon ko rokenge
 He wrote that Facebook will now check all applications, which are associated with them
 jo bhi develper audit karwaane ko raji nahin hoga, use bain kiya jayega
 Apart from this, if you have not used an app for three months, then your data will be withdrawn from the developer
 vahiin ap ko diya jane vaala data ab sirf naam, profile photo or email adress tak hi simit rakhaa jayega
 He told that we will make some changes in the news feed in the next one month, so that the user will be able to sign himself out from some apps
 ye tul abhi bhi setting main maujuud he, lekin ab ise news feed main laayaa jayega
 What's wrong is that Cambridge Analytica, a firm that helped Donald Trump in the US presidential election, has been accused of stealing personal information of about 50 million Facebook users
 is jaankaree ko kathith taur par chunaav ke dauraan trump ko jitaane main sahyog or virdohi kii chhavi kharaab karne ke liye istemaal kiya gaya he

 The BJP has cut the ticket of Banaskantha MP and Minister Haribhai Chaudhary as well as Porbandar MP Vitthal Radadia and Panchmahal MP Prabhat Singh Chauhan
 bijepi ke banaaskantha se saansad haribhai choudhary, is seat par chaar baar jeet chuke hai, phir bhi bijepi ne yahaan rupani sarkaar main mantri parbatbhai patel ko tikat diya he
 After the 2017 elections, there was a big reversal in the equation here, people started opposing Haribhai Chaudhary
 itnaa hi nahin banaaskantha bijepi main andruni ladaai kaaphi zyada ho chuki thi, jis vajah se party ne maujuuda saasand kaa tikat kaat parbatbhai patel ko tikat diya he
 Vitthal Radadia, a domineering MP from Porbandar, was an MP from the Porbandar Lok Sabha seat for the last 20 years, this time the BJP has also cut his ticket
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki vitthal radadia kii tabiyat kharaab hone kii vajah se unhone apane bete ke liye tikat maanga tha, jabaki vitthal radadia ke bade bete jyesh radadia gujarat sarkaar main kebinet mantri he
 Supporters of Radhadiya are putting up posters against the BJP here due to Vitthal Radadia's family not getting tickets
 in poster main likhaa gaya he ki agar radadia ko tikat nahin to bhaajapa nahin
 Ramesh Dhaduk has been given a ticket from this seat, who is considered close to Amit Shah
 vahiin bijepi ne panchamahal se pichley 2 baar se saansad rahe prabhaat singh chouhan kaa bhi tikat kaat diya he
 However Prabhat Singh Chauhan had already demanded a ticket for himself
 saath hi unhone kaha tha ki agar bijepi tikat nahin degi to wo is seat par bijepi ko haraayenge
 BJP has given Ratan Singh a ticket from the Lok Sabha seat of Panchmahal
 ratan singh ne pehali baar 2017 vidhansabha chunaav main nirdaleey ke taur par jeet kar bijepi kaa daaman thama tha
 Let me tell you that till now BJP has declared candidates for 19 seats out of 26 Lake Sabha seats of Gujarat and BJP is playing bets on new faces in its stronghold
 bundelkhand main mahila adhikaron kaa jhanda buland karne vaali gulabi gang kii netaa sampat paal apane jivan par ban rahi film 'gulab gang' ke virodh main utar ai hai
 Sampat has said that the Madhuri Dixit starrer 'gulab Gang', released on her life-struggle, without permission from them, will take to the streets and protest
 sampat ne bataaya ki unki jindagi, bundelkhand jaise dakiyanoosee samaaj main mahilaon ke adhikaron kii aawaaj uthaane kii unki jaddojahad or lakshya prapti ke liye gathit ‘gulabi gang’ par aadhaarit ‘gulab gang’ naam se yah film banaayi gayi he, lekin iske liye unase poocha tak nahin gaya
 This is incorrect and if the film is released, it will be strongly opposed
 unhone kaha chunki yah film mere jivan par bani he isaliye ‘film ke liye hamase anumati lee jaae, nahin to ham sadakon par utrenge, jantar-mantar par dharna-pradarshan karenge
 If they have the courage, then release the film
 unhen ummid he ki sarkaar hamaari baat bhi jarur sunegi
 We have worked hard to raise the voice of women, no one can do it openly
 ’sampat ne bataaya ki ‘gulab gang’ film ko lekar unhone uske nirmaataa or nirdeshak ko pichley maheene banda se ek notice bheja tha uske baad mumbai se ek vyakti aayaa jisane unhen maadhuri se ek award dilwane kaa laalach diya jise unhone sakhti se nakaar diya
 Significantly, Gulab Gang, based on 'gulabi Gang', created to raise the voice of Sampat's life and women's rights, resident of the backward Banda district of Bundelkhand, is to be released on March 7
 is film ke nirmaataa anubhav sinha hai jabaki nirdeshak saumik sen hai
 Sampath, who had contested from Manikpur Assembly seat in Uttar Pradesh in 2012 on a Congress ticket, said on the question of his candidature for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections that he has sent his candidature from Banda seat to Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 unhone kaha ki agar unhen tikat mila to chunaav ladengi or agar nahin mila to congress ke pratyaashee kaa samarthan karengi
 Sampat said that his pink gang will campaign for the Congress in Amethi, the constituency of Sonia's parliamentary constituency Rae Bareli and his MP son Rahul Gandhi
 sampat ne kaha ki unhen bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa), samaajawaadee party (sapa) or aam aadmi party (aap) ne bhi chunaav kaa tikat dene kii peshkash kii he lekin unhone ise sweekaar nahin kiya he
 He said that even if bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi would come and give him an election ticket, she would not accept it, because Congress President Sonia had supported him, not Modi, when false cases were filed against him

 Dinesh Trivedi, who was forced to resign from the post of Railway Minister due to the increase in railway fares, said on Friday that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would have retained the post even in the event of losing the support of Trinamool Congress, but he was the only one to save the government from crisis
 Resigned trinmul congress adhyaksh mamata banerjee ke kehane parrel mantri ke pad se istifadene vaale party saansad trivedi congress main shaamil hone kii atakalon ke sambandh main puche gayi sawaal par jawaab dene se bachate rahe
 In a TV program, Trivedi claimed that if he did not want to resign, the Prime Minister would never ask him for it
 purv rail mantri se jab poocha gaya ki kya pradhanmantri trinmul congress kaa samarthan khone kii keemat par bhi unhen apane mantrimandal main rakhte to unhone ‘haa’ main jawaab diya
 When Trivedi was asked whether people would not be surprised by these statements, he said, 'this is the truth
 ’sansad main pradhanmantri manmohan singh dwaara trivedi ke istife par ‘khed jataane’ sambandhi bayaan kaa ullekh karte hue trinmul netaa ne kaha ki unhen bataaya gaya tha ki pradhanmantri unase istife ke liye kabhi nahin kehete
 On whether this message came from a reliable person, he said, "there is no need to go into more details
" main ye sari baaten nahin karuunga
 If i have said anything, i will stand by it
 ’trivedi ne is dharna ko bhi khaarij kar diya ki unhone pradhanmantri karyaalay or congress party se kisi tarah ke sanket milane ke baad istipha diya
 He persisted that he stepped down to save the government from instability
 unhone kaha, ‘kisi taraf se koi sanket nahin aayaa
 If i did not resign that evening (last Sunday), i could have instigated the government, which is not my job
 ’trivedi ne kaha ki unhone istipha isliye diya kyonki unki party trinmul congress or unki netaa mamata banerjee ne unase aisa karne ke liye kaha
 On the question of the possibility of joining the Congress, the former railway minister refrained from answering, however, he said, 'politics is not a career for me

 Nitish Kumar is always on the target of RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari
 lekin is baar unhone media ko apana nishaanaa banaaya he
 In fact, Shivanand Tiwari objected to the statements issued by the Nitish government, saying that Nitish's advisors issue statements in foul language and the media gives them such an impression
 unhone kaha ki aisi baaten jo samaaj main bhashaa ko lekar ku-sanskaar failaati hai, unka sampadan to hona chahie
 He has shared this edict to the media on his Facebook page
 unhone likhaa he, 'agar main kahuun ki nitish kumaar main niraj yaa sanjay singh yaa alok kaa ansh he to aapako tajjub ho saktaa he
 These people are spokespersons of Nitish Kumar

 In this answer there is arrogance on the one hand and on the other side there is a feeling of concern for the ideological opponent
 jo apane liye ahankaar or virdohi ke prati hikaarat kaa bhav rakhata he uske munh se vahi bhashaa niklegi jo nitish kii ore se bolne waalon ke munh se nikalati he

 kiskaa andaazi-takkar sateek baithegaa ladaai is baat ko lekar he
 Now the fight is not in the NDA and the Grand Alliance
 ladaai he koun sa agsit pole sahi he
 There are so many results that i demand that an All India Exit Poll Regulatory Commission be made in India and its chairman be made to me, so that i can verify which the exit poll is correct
 tippaniyan Exit polls have their own history of right and wrong and you know
 jaise hi guuruuvaar ko today chanakya ne kaha ki bihar main endie ko 243 main 155 siten aa sakati hai or mahagathbandhan ko thanthan yani 83 to isse haar jeet kaa andaazi-takkar yani aankalan karne waalon kii duniya main hadakamp much gaya
 Those who should have been happy, they did happen, but they must have been scared inside
 shuukravaar dopaher ko exis maai india ne apana survey jari kiya to gend in swing kii jagah out swing ho chuki thi yani mahagathbandhan ko 169 se 183 siten milane kaa daawa kiya gaya or endie 64
 All this is happening if there is no exit poll regulatory commission
 sochiye ek eggzet pole main endie 155 siten paa rahi he or ek main sirf 64
 Grand Alliance 169 to 183 in one and 83 in one
 taraazoo sahi nahin he yaa batkhara ye main nahin bataa saktaa
 But it is sure that Axis removed this data by putting it on its website
 exis ke maidan se hatane ke baad chanakya akelaa maidan main khadaa he jo bijepi ke jeetne kii saaf saaf bhavishyavaanee kar rahaa he
 According to the rest of the exit poll, there is no visible wave for either side
 yah ekadam saaf he
 So anything can happen on the 8th

 3 pratishat
 So who will win Bihar elections, whoever wins will ultimately win eight
 eggzet pole ke sahi galat hone kaa apana itihaas he or aap to jaanate hi hai
 As soon as on Thursday, Chanakya said that the NDA in Bihar could get 155 seats out of 243 and the Grand Alliance had a tizzy - 83 or so - and the defeat of the victory in the world of the estimators
 jinhen khush hona chahie tha, wo to hue magar bheetar bheetar ve bhi saham gaye honge
 When Axis My India released its survey on Friday afternoon, the ball was swung out instead of in-swing, ie the Grand Alliance claimed 169 to 183 seats and NDA 64
 agar agsit pole niamak ayog na hone kii vajah se ye sab ho rahaa he
 Think NDA is getting 155 seats in one exit poll and only 64 seats in one
 ek main mahagathbandhan 169 se 183 to ek main 83
 i cannot tell if the scales are not right or weighed
 par ye zarur hua ki exis ne ye aankada apni website par daalkar hataa liya
 After the Axis withdrew from the field, Chanakya stands alone in a field that is clearly predicting the bjp's victory
 baaki agsit pole ke anusaar kisi ek paksh ke liye lahar nahin dikhti he
 It is very clear
 isliye aath taarikh ko kuch bhi ho saktaa he

 jaraa sochie agar aapkaa jimail (gmail) hack ho jaae yani uskaa password kisi ke haath lag jaae to aap par kya kahar barasegaa? aapaki gopneey jaankaree haikar ke haath lag jaaegi
 By the time you get the idea of this theft, you will not know how many secrets have been exposed
 agar password gaya to sab gaya!offis ke jaruri email, jinhen aapane jimail main sambhaal kar rakhaa tha, aapaki selary slip, bank ditels, investment or inshorance kaa puraa byoraa, mutual fund kii slip, elisi kaa premium, online kharidari kii raseeden, iemai kii ditels, rail or hawaii jahaaj kii tikaten, passport kii scan copy, pan-card, credit-card, hotel booking, inakam tex kaa kaccha chittha, inakam tex ritern kii raseed
 
 
 If you look at the old pages of your Gmail, you will remember how many of your secrets you have surrendered to Gmail
 lekin dhyaan rakhen agar password gaya to ye sab bhi gaya!aglaa shikaar aap ho sakate habgar aap android phone istemaal karte hai to aapako pataa hi hoga ki aapke phone main jo kuch bhi he, lagbhag wo sabhi google ke loker main bhi band he
 Whether it was pictures sent on Google Plus or papers hidden in 'google Drive'
 har din lakhon password hack hote hai
 The next number can be yours
 ek hi hoga google ke sabhi aplications (apps) kaa passwordye to aapako pataa hi hoga kii google kii duniya main har taale kii chaabi ek hi hoti he
 That is, all Google's apps (apps) will have the same password
 chaahe wo krom browsar (chrome browser) ho, jimail chat ho yaa you-tub (you Tube)
 Meaning, if your password is known, then within a moment this distinction will be revealed that which websites you visit silently in the office, close the room in the house and chat with whom and late night on youtube (youtube) Find videos
 yahi nahin, aapako yaad dilaa duun ki tamaam duusari websites par ekanut kholte samay aapane jimail kaa hi pataa diya tha

 Now whenever you try to log in to your Gmail from a new computer, in addition to your password, you will also have to enter a six digit verification code

 There is yet another difficulty but a little difficulty is yet to come
 jimail par taala to lag gaya lekin google or jimail se judi kuch or services ho saktaa he samaj naa paaen kii aapane tu-step veriphication shuru kar diya he
 Some applications may ask to log in again and some may stop working

 To fix, either through the browser on the phone (gmail
 com tip karke) par jaaen or apane phone number (yaa bacup phone number) par jo chah disit kaa code mili use daal kar log-in kar len
 This has to be done only once
 uske baad aapkaa phone baar-baar veriphication code nahin maangega

 Rani Mukherjee, who is enjoying the success of 'hichki', has said that the age of an actress or her Marital States has nothing to do with the hit or flop of the film
 unka maananaa he ki agar aap darshakon ko acchhee film banaakar dete hai to unhen aapke shaadishuda hone se koi fark nahin padataa
 He told INS- 'the success of Hiccup changed the thinking of many people
 ye samajhnaa jaruri he ki audiyans badal rahi he
 They want to see good films and good content
 jab aap unhen acchhee film dete hai to unhen aapke marital stats se koi fark nahin padataa
 '
 
 
 to is vajah se backbenchar thim rani mukherjirani kaa kahana he ki darshak filmon se anterten hona chaahate hai
 He further said- 'what i am doing in my personal life should not make sense to anyone
 agar main aisi filmein kar rahi hum, jo mujhe janch rahi he or jisase audiyans conect ho paa rahi he to meri nijee jindagi se kisi ko matlab nahin hona chahie
 Rani wants to do Bunty Aur Babli 2, said - Masti roll likes, says that many actresses have proved that even after marriage, the audience likes heroines
 unhone kaha- 'unki filmein bhi flop hoti hai, jinaki shaadi nahin hui he or jinke bachche nahin hai
