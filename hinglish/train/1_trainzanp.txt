 Now you see how much more creativity can come from you in this style! purv cricket captain kapil dev hameshaa se bebaak rahe hai or unhen captain mahendra singh dhoni or maujuuda test captain viraat kohli kii bhi tulana karnaa ho to wo apni raay dene se nahin hichakate
 During a special conversation with NDTV, 1983 World Cup winner captain Kapil Dev said, 'virat Kohli has an aggressive attitude
 jab ham 80 ke dashak kii ore dekhte hai tab us team main akramakata nahin hoti thi
 But now the team looks very aggressive
 emes dhoni ne 7-8 saal tak dabadabaa banaaye rakhaa
 But he was a different performer
 jabaki viraat akramak hai
 ' kapil maanate hai ki aaj team main jo akramakata he wo samay kii maang he, isliye jaays he
 He says, 'today when i see Team India, i get shocked and say why not? The team should take such a stand
 'tippaniyan Kapil says that Virat should make his place
 har cricketer kii apni ek alag shaksiyat hoti he
 No cricketer can be like another
 viraat ne bataur captain behad acha pradarshan kiya he jo dhoni bahut pehle kar chuke hai
 Kapil Dev has also advised Team India to be careful about the current india-new Zealand series
 kapil dev kehete hai, 'aaj ke daur main koi bhi team kisi bhi team ko haraa sakati he
 It will not be easy for the New Zealand team to come to India and win under these conditions
 ab antarrashtriya cricketron ko sabhi deshon ke halaat ke bare main zyaada maaloom hota he
 Because they go there and play
 kiwi team isi baat kaa faaydaa uthaa sakati he
 ' NDTV se khaas baatcheet ke dauraan 1983 world cap ke vijeta captain kapil dev ne kaha, 'viraat kohli aakraamak ravaiya rakhte hai
 When we look back to the 80s, there was no aggression in that team
 lekin ab team ekadam aakraamak nazar aati he
 MS Dhoni dominated for 7-8 years
 lekin wo ek alag paraformar the
 While Virat is the aggressor
 ' Kapil believes that the aggression in the team today is the need of the hour, hence it is justified
 wo kehete hai, 'aaj team india ko dekhtaa hum to hairaan ho jaataa hum or kahata hum kyon nahin? team ko aisa hi rukh rakhana chahie
 Comments kapil kehete hai ki viraat ko apni jagah banani chahie
 Every cricketer has a different personality
 koi cricketer duusare jaisaa nahin ban saktaa
 Virat has done extremely well as a captain, which Dhoni has done long ago
 maujuuda bharat-newzealand series ko lekar bhi kapil dev ne team india ko saavdhaan rahane kii salaah di he
 Kapil Dev says, "in today's era, any team can beat any team
 newzealand team ke liye bharat aakar in halaat main jeetna aasaan nahin hoga
 Now international cricketers know more about the situation in all countries
 kyonki wo vahaan jaakar khel pate hai
 The Kiwi team can take advantage of this

 Khan was seen as obstinate
 haalanki kai bhartiya vishleshkon kaa maananaa tha ki darasal imran sari pareshaaniyon kii jad or sabase bade khalanaayak pakistani sena pramukh general qamar javed bajva ke pyadebhar hai
 Khan, supported by Pakistan's army, showed Awam the dream of a "new Pakistan"
 isamen mulk ko bhrashtachar se mukt karana or diwalia hone ke kagaar par khadi arthvyavastha ko patari par laane kii baat unhone kahi thi
 After coming to power, Khan also indicated that he was ready to start a new innings with India
 gaddi sanbhaalane ke ek maheene ke bheetar unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi ko ek patr likhaa jisamen kashmir (pakistan kii mukhya chintaa), aatankwaad (bharat kii sabase badi chintaa) or donon deshon ke bich vyapaarik sambandhon sahit sabhi mahatvapurn muddon ko hal karne ke liye aage badhkar prayaas karne kii ichha jataai thi
 He suggested that the foreign ministers of the two countries, during the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York, should separately consider the "possibilities of moving forward"
 bharat ne bahut saavdhaneepurvak unka prastaav sweekaar to kar liya lekin ek din ke bheetar hi apane rukh main badlaav laate hue kaha ki maujuuda "chintajanak or dukhadaayi ghatnaon'' kii vajah se vaarta sthagit kii jaati he
 The Foreign Ministry spokesman announced the cancellation of the meeting, citing "brutal killings" by Pakistani soldiers of Indian security personnel and the recently released 20 postage stamps in Pakistan glorifying terrorists who attacked India
 
 ve asaamaanya sakht lahaze kaa parichay dete hue yahaan tak kah gaye ki shpakistan kaa dusht agenda ab khulkar saamne aa gaya he or duniya ne pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan kaa asli cheharaa bhi dekh liya he
 On this, Khan became an attacker on Modi and wrote a tweet tweet, "all my life i have seen small people occupying big positions, who lack vision and big vision
 ''bhartiya bayaan ke kai myne the
 The terrorists' postage stamps were issued in July when Khan was not in power and if India has come to know of this now then it is a big intelligence failure
 biguef ke jawan kaa galaa retkar uski nirmam hatya or antarrashtriya seemaa par uskaa shav milane kii ghatana to vaarta prastaav sweekaar karne se ek din pehle ghat chuki thi
 The incident of killing three J&K police personnel is new, but in the recent past, there have been many such incidents in the valley
 phir bharat sarkaar ne itnaa sakht tevar kyon dikhaaya, yah bhi ek paheli bani hui he
 Indian sources claim that intelligence agencies had solid evidence that Pakistan-backed terrorist organizations had killed three policemen in the valley to disrupt the upcoming panchayat elections
 unka maananaa he ki khan to bas antarrashtriya str par chhavi ko durust karne kaa dikhaava kar rahe the taaki pakistani sena par aatankwaad ke khilaaf eemaandaar prayaas karne kaa jo antarrashtriya dabaav bana he use kuch kam kiya ja sake
 If India had such an assessment, then it should not have agreed to negotiate
 is haalia tu-tu,main-main kaa nateeja yah hua ki bharat or pakistan ne ab khud ko pehle se bhi zyada tanatani kii sthiti main laa khadaa kiya he
 The Modi government should introspect as to why the situation in Kashmir is not being taken care of in spite of a strong attitude
 or yah ghati main pakistan ke napak mansoobon ko prabhavi tareeke se roak paane main kyon ab tak vifal rahi he
 Pakistan is also accountable, especially to the army chief
 agar bajva kehete hai ki khan kii tarah vah bhi donon deshon ke bich shanti chaahate hai, to unhen kam se kam yah to sunishchit karnaa hi chahie ki unki sena elosi par yudhviram ke samjhaute kaa ulanghan nahin karegi or ghuspaithiyon ko kashmir main bhejne kii koshishen band karegi
 There is always hope and scope for a new beginning, but the effort should also be to ensure that the beginning does not have the usual tragic end
 agar bharat ko aisa lagata he ki imran khan kii koshishen bas antarrashtriya dabaav ko kam karne kaa dikhaava maatr thim to use vaarta ke liye pehle hami hi nahin bharani chahie thi

 However, his party Congress has been raising the issue of EVM disturbances
 punjab hi ekmaatr aisa rajya he jahaan haal hi hue vidhansabha main chunaav ke baad congress ne captain ke netritv main sarkaar banaai
 Amarinder said that i would not have been the Chief Minister if there were disturbances in the evms

 Significantly, the Congress had won 77 out of 117 assembly seats in Punjab and sacked the long-standing Akali Dal
 lekin aaj congress ne anya vipakshi dalon ke saath chunaav ayog main iviem main gadabadi kii shikaayat kii
 The parties allege that the BJP got an overwhelming majority in Uttar Pradesh due to machine malfunctions

 He said that now there is no question of holding elections with ballot paper

 Meanwhile, amid the political attacks of tampering with evms, the Election Commission has once again claimed that such allegations are baseless and clearly stated that no tampering with evms is possible
 ayog iviem ke samarthan main khulkar saamne aayaa he
 The Election Commission will challenge the EVM to prove tampering in the first week of May after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal repeatedly questioned the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM)

 During this time there will be an open challenge to do three to four level tampering in evms

 The Election Commission says that even in 2009, after the ownership of EVM was questioned, we gave open challenge but no one could prove it
 gauratlab he ki congress ne punjab main 117 vidhansabha siton main se 77 par jeet hasil kii thi or lambey samay se sattashin akali dal ko bedakhal kar diya tha
 But today the Congress along with other opposition parties complained about the EVM disturbances in the Election Commission

 At the same time, Aasia Bibi's lawyer has left Pakistan in the early hours of Saturday, fearing for her life

 Please tell that Asia Bibi's lawyer saif-ul-malook left Pakistan citing threat of life

 kareeb ek hafte pehle usne likhaa ki factory main jo kuch siikhnaa tha, vah sab usne sikh liya he or ab sawaal unheen chizon ko dohraane or aage badhaane kaa he
 He does not think they will teach him anything new
 isliye sanjay soch rahaa he ki course puraa na kare balki saal ke aakhir main yaa uske aasapaas chhod de or shaayad khud apana kaam jamaane ke liye bharat laut aae
 i am writing this with great confidence and royalty because Sanjay does not want me to mention this to anyone

 i personally feel that this can be difficult in India, especially because it may not be possible to raise too much capital in the beginning to set up his own work
 main nahin jaanati ki in maamalon se aapkaa kitna vaasta he, par agar sanjay ko isamen shaamil kiye bagaiyr aap koi rasta nikaal saken to behad ehsaanmand rahuungi
 One reason may be that he feels cut off and alone in the crew at the far end

 i of course don't know why and how that crew went? Was it his choice? Was he really interested? Rajiv is a good boy

 Subsequent events revealed that Haksar really connected the conversation with Sanjay Gandhi and clearly stated in his words that he should complete the Rolls Royce course and not leave at the end of two years, while that young man i had decided to do so
 maa ke dost kii salaah se chidh paidaa honi hi thi or yah sanjay gandhi main haksar ke khilaaf pehali nakaaratmak baat thi
 Soon more negative things were about to gather
 farvari 1967 main jab hindustan chunaavon kii taraf bad rahaa tha, indira gandhi ne haksar ke saath apni khato-kitabat phir kaayam kii
 In the very early days of February 1967, perhaps on the 4th or 5th, in the middle of his election campaign, Indira Gandhi wrote him a letter offering a fat offer:
 
 
 main raibareli kaa daura karte hue jaldbaaji main aapako likh rahi hum
 i have been writing to you for a long time so that i can thank you for your letter and also ask you if you would like to come to Delhi
 yah aakhri baat beshak samay se pehle kii he
 i do not know my own future right now, but leave aside the system that will emerge after the elections
 lekin maine sochaa aapako apane vichaaron se aagaah kar dena chahie
 
 
 Haksar sent a three-page reply on February 10, 1967, which would be good to quote in detail, as it exposes a lot about him and also echoes some echoes of today, especially the cow and its cow dung
 Which he has mentioned: My dear Induji: i am very grateful to you that you took time to write in the midst of all this disaster
 
 
 aap bahut acchhee or dayaalu hai jo aapane mujhase poocha ki kya main dilli aana chaahunga
 Yes, of course

 is chote-se vakt ke dauraan agar main aapke kisi bhi kaam aa saktaa hum to main ise apni "kaamkaaji'' jindagi ke makul ant kii sambhaavna ke taur par dekhuunga
 
 
 
 chunaav ke nattejey jaldi hi aa jaaenge
 
 
 People who do not like very much, also have to show goodwill towards them
 lekin agar congress logon ke liye roti kaa intjaam karnaa chaahati he, to vah dhire-dhire nishaan ke taur par gaay yaa belon kii bajaae tractor ko apanaae
 Doing all this while protecting our national dignity and sacrificing our freedom, there is no other option but this one
 varanaa gaay or uskaa gobar hamen dubo denge
 
 
 It was magnificent and unmatched Haksar: bluntly, bellow and fearless, honest to the extent of being ruthless in his thoughts and opinions
 unhen ek shandaar ohade kii peshkash kii ja rahi thi or peshkash karne vaale shaks ko ve bataa rahe the ki kaam kaa unka aakhri din koun-sa hoga
 The style and speculation of this letter, in the same style, were written to the Prime Minister during the next five and a half years and even after that
 daraar12 june, 1975 indira gandhi or haksar ke liye khaufnak din tha
 It was not only the day when Justice (jagmohan) Sinha's verdict came but he was dawn in New Delhi at the age of 57 years

 Started with Dhar's death
 pant 52 kii umr main chale gaye the or mohan kumarmangalam kaa nidhan 55 kii umr main hua tha, donon 1973 main teen maheenon ke antaraal main gaye
 Haksar's closest "left" in the government seemed to give a mild wretch
 26 june, 1975 ko immergency kaa elaan ho gaya tha or naagarik swatantraaaen khatm hone lageen
 Much has been written about this and i will not add to it
 jis baat kaa sidhaa vaasta is kitaab se he, vah ek maheene se bhi kam vakt main, thik-thik kahen to 15 july, 1975 ko ghati
 It was on this day that Haksar's 82-year-old uncle Inderbhai, who had been his guardian since the 1930s, was absolutely arrested on Sanjay Gandhi's orders
 padhai jari rakhane kii landan main di gai haksar kii nek salaah kii vajah se ek dashak se man main palati chidh, unki car pariyojna chhudwane ke liye unki maa ko achche iraade se di gai haksar kii salaah se upje paanch saal ke aakrosh or unki maa ko kanoonee pareshaaniyon main daalane vaali haksar kii gavaahi se paidaa hue paanch maheene ke gusse ne aakhirkaar sanjay gandhi ko haksar par thik vahaan chot karne kii kaaphi vajah de di, jahaan sabase zyada thes lagati he
 Urmila Haksar later wrote a book and stated in it all that Haksar and his family had to go through during those two years
 pandit bros ne 1927 main nai dilli ke chandani chowk se shuruyaat kii thi or baad main nai dilli ke conot place main ek showrooms kholaa tha
 Initially it was a dealer of products of Bombay Dyeing, an old and well known textile company of Bombay
 baad main pandit bros ne home furniture or aisi hi duusari chizon main bhi pair failaae the, pandit bros kii 80 fisadi milkiyat haksar ke chachaa ke paas thi, 10 fisadi haksar kii bahan ke paas or 10 fisadi unki patni ke paas
 Haksar's uncle and 78-year-old brother-in-law were arrested on the morning of July 15, 1975, without knowing that the Pandit brothers were involved in the disturbances

 unhone mujhase nigahen nahin milaayin or nazren churaati raheen
 "haksar wrote to the Prime Minister on July 9, 1982, and it is clear that he (prime Minister) had completely ignored her while planning this important visit: You are going to Washington
" main nahin jaanata is yatra se ham kya hasil karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 And i am surprised that a specific area of possible agreements between our own and the US has been outlined

 We have to pay for getting something out of America
 main nahin samaj paata ki america hamen kya de saktaa he jo hamaare liye arthpurna ho
 And what can we potentially give? Of course it is always possible to negotiate to try to understand how Reagan's brain works — of course, one also has to believe that Reagan has a mind

 Nevertheless, in the last few years i have met many Pakistanis, officials and private individuals
 unase baat karke main is nishkarsh par pahunchaa hum ki aaj pakistan shaitan kaa jaise khulata kadaha ban chukaa he, vaisaa shaayad pehle kabhi nahin rahaa he
 It is not just cooking on low heat but can boil
 
 
 main hamaare up-mahadweep ke rajnatik paridrishy par jitna vichaar karata hum, utana hi meraa vishwaas is baat ke liye pakkaa hota jaataa he ki hamen sanjeeda kism ke or samaan vichaar vaale pakistani tathaa bangladeshi logon ke saath sampark, mail-jol, baatcheet badhaane kii disha main gambhir or tej prayaas karne chahie
 It is very necessary for the permanent peace restoration in this sub-continent and similarly we will be able to reach the status of a temporary federation between India, Pakistan and Bangladesh
 maine kuch samay pehle yah paraamarsh dene kii chhot lee thi ki jo bhi congressi 1969 main alag hue the, unako phir se ek karne kii jarurat he
 When Antony (a

 The last two lines reflected the humility of a man who was once his intimate friend and trusted advisor
 indira gandhi ke 2 farvari, 1983 ko bheje jawaab se bhi kuch khaas baat nahin bani
 That was a very brief and rough answer
 
 
 
 Indira Gandhi thought it better to keep silence on the suggestion of reuniting the old Congressmen who left the party due to Emergency or Sanjay Gandhi

 On December 23, 1993, Haksar gave Dr

 i could introduce you to the terrible history of the functioning of nationalized banks

 But neither the Prime Minister nor the Finance Minister took note of this
 phir immergency ke dauraan ek vyakti jo banking ke vishay main kuch nahin jaanata tha, uskaa elisi se tabadalaa karke rigerv bank kaa governor bana diya gaya or kaaryakari dipti governor ko chunaa gaya

 main uskaa naam thik-thik yaad kar paa rahaa hum to vah luthra tha, jise hajaari jaise behad eemaandaar or kartavyaparayan vyannti ko hataakar yah jimmedaari saunpi gai thi
 However, to expect our leaders to learn from history and take advantage of it is like expecting too much
 baharhaal, mujhe vishwaas he ki is desh ko aapke netritv kaa laabh praapt hota rahegaa
 Was Haksar, one of the teams that prepared the script for the nationalization of banks overnight, being mistaken for this decision after 24 years? i do not think so
 unako rashtriyakaran kaa malaal nahin tha balki netaaon ne jis prakaar ise apane shikanje main le liya tha or iske mul uddeshyon ko khatm kar diya tha, uskaa unhen pachhtaawaa jarur rahaa hoga
 But Haksar could have guessed it? Did he really feel that there would never be any political interference? Yes, as long as they were, they kept the leaders away from him

 The BJP, which is enjoying the power of the country's power, now wants to see itself as the largest party in the world
 ek november kopiem narendra modi ne party ke sadsyta abhiyaan kii shuruyaat khud kisadsyta ke navinikaran ke saath kii
 After 12 days, 56 lakh new members have been added to the BJP so far
 saptahanth tak yah 60 lakh kii rekha ko paar kar sakati he
 Party President Amit Shah is happy with this, but his desire is to further strengthen the political domination of the party
 aankadon ke mutabik, bijepi se is vakt kareeb 3
 5 crore members are connected
 yah desh kii kisi bhi party ke sadasyon kii sankhya main sabase adhik he
 But Shah's strategy is to make this party the largest party in the world
 yani sadsyta ke maamle main bijepi kii sidhi takkar china kii communist party (sipisi) se he
 It is said that a total of 8 of CPC
 3 karod sadsy hai
 Another big reason for the BJP to be happy this time is that the participation of overseas Indians in membership campaigns has increased this time
 jaahir taur par iskaa sidhaa sambandh pradhanmantri narendra modi kii chamatkaari chhavi se he or piem ke taaja videshi daure se bhi is abhiyaan ko laabh mil saktaa he
 According to the English newspaper 'times of India', BJP national secretary and co-convenor of the membership campaign, Arun Singh, says, "this time there is a lot of enthusiasm in the campaign
 jis teji se log jud rahe hai, ummid he bijepi duniya kii sabase badi party banakar ubharegi
 Amit Shah is said to have also asked the workers to aim to overtake the Communist Party of China
 haalanki sipisi ke sadasyon kii itani badi sankhya hone ke peeche ek badi vajah yah he ki china main pipul libration army or naukarshahi se jude har shaks ke liye jeevanabhar sipisi kii sadsyta anivaary he
 Benefit from mobile and online facility Two new items were added to bjp's membership campaign this year
 pehali yah ki koi bhi vyakti party kii website par jaakar sadsy ban saktaa he
 Membership can also be done by sending an SMS to a mobile number issued by the other party
 iske alaava ek toll free number bhi he, jis par missd kol dekar sadsyta ke liye aavedan kiya ja saktaa he
 Arun Singh says, 'any person can join us by giving a missed call to the toll free number
 ham puure cader ko phone or lagaataar party ke kaaryakramon ke bare main esemes bhejkar jode rakhte hai
 However, amidst all this, a senior party worker said that the party would have to do something to a new level to keep the members connected, as they often lost regular contact with them
 inamen se badi sankhya ke paas party kaa parichay patr bhi nahin hota

 Kejriwal government of Delhi is being accused of rigging in the purchase and sale of cheap onions, what is the status of that onion scheme right now? To know this, we should go towards those 280 ration shops in Delhi where these onions are being sold
 sabase pehle main chandani chowk vidhansabha kshetra ke majanu kaa tila kii ek rashan kii dukaan par pahunchaa
 There was neither cheap onion banner outside the shop nor was there any glimpse of onion when peeping inside the shop
 dukandaar babu ram gupta ne bataaya ki 12 sitambar ke baad unki dukaan par koi pyaaj nahin aayaa
 People present told that last time about 10 days ago, they had bought 30 kg kg of onion from this shop, but since then there is still waiting for cheap onion
 rashan kii dukaan ke thik saamne sabzi kaa thela lagaae manoj kumaar ne bataaya ki wo pyaaj 60 rupee kilo bech rahe hai
 Manoj told that when onions used to come to this ration shop, at that time he used to see only 30 rupees onion standing as a spectator because when he gets 30, then who will ask 60 rupees? ab iske baad main nai dilli ke bishwambhar das maarg kii ek rashan kii dukaan par panhucha
 The banner of the Rs 30 kg onion scheme was put outside the shop, but shopkeeper Ramesh Kumar, who was present there, said that onion had not come to him for almost a week
 ab iske baad main jangpura vidhansabha kshetra main padane vaale hari nagar ashram kii ek rashan ke dukaan main pahunchaa
 Last time also when i was doing a story on this scheme of cheap onion of Delhi government, only this ration shop got onion
 tippaniyan When reached at the shop, it came to know that this time there is no sign of onion here for two weeks
 dukandaar pawan ne bataaya ki 12 sitambar ke baad se yahaan koi pyaaj sarkaar kii taraf se nahin aayaa
 Pawan told that when he calls in the food supply department, it is said that there is no onion in the warehouse, hence it is not coming
 kul milakar baat ye he ki dilli sarkaar jis saste pyaaj ke skim par dilli sarkaar kii itani fazihat ho rahi he ki wo sasti pyaaj dilli ke logon ko mil hi nahin rahi he
 First i reached a ration shop of Majnu Ka Tila of Chandni Chowk Assembly constituency
 dukaan ke baahar naa to saste pyaaj kaa binar tha or naa hi dukaan ke andar jhaankne par pyaaj kii koi jhalak mil rahi thi
 Shopkeeper Babu Ram Gupta told that after September 12, no onion came to his shop
 aasapaas maujuud logon ne bataaya kii pichley baar kareeb 10 din pehle unhone is dukaan se 30 rupee kilo pyaaj kharidi thi, lekin uske baad se abhi sasti pyaaj kaa intazaar hi he
 Manoj Kumar, who planted vegetables in front of the ration shop, said that he is selling onions for Rs 60 a kg
 manoj ne bataaya ki jab is rashan ke dukaan par pyaaj aata tha to us vaqt wo keval 30 rupee kilo vaale pyaaj ko ek darshak kii tarah khadey dekhte the kyonki jab 30 main milegaa to 60 rupee vaale ko koun poochhega? Now after that i reached a ration shop in Bishwambhar Das Marg, New Delhi
 dukaan ke baahar 30 rupee kilo pyaaj kii skim kaa binar to laga tha lekin vahaan maujuud dukandaar ramesh kumaar ne bataaya ki unke yahaan pyaaj lagbhag ek hafte se nahin aayaa
 Now after this, i reached a ration shop in Hari Nagar Ashram falling in Jangpura assembly constituency
 pichhali baar bhi jab main dilli sarkaar ke saste pyaaj kii is skim par story kar rahaa tha, tab keval isi rashan kii dukaan pyaaj mila tha
 The comments dukaan par pahunchaa to pataa chalaa ki is baar to yahaan bhi do hafte se pyaaj kaa koi ata pataa hi nahin he
 Shopkeeper Pawan said that since September 12, no onion had come here from the government
 pawan ne bataaya ki wo jab khaadya aapurti vibhaag main phone karte hai, to kaha jaataa he ki godaam main pyaaj nahin he isliye nahin aa rahi he
 Overall, it is a matter of cheap onion scheme that the Delhi government is getting so upset that the people of Delhi are not getting this cheap onion
 rashan kii dukaan ke thik saamne sabzi kaa thela lagaae manoj kumaar ne bataaya ki wo pyaaj 60 rupee kilo bech rahe hai
 Manoj told that when onions used to come to this ration shop, at that time he used to see only 30 rupees onion standing as a spectator because when he gets 30, then who will ask 60 rupees? ab iske baad main nai dilli ke bishwambhar das maarg kii ek rashan kii dukaan par panhucha

 mahaan harfanmaulaa kapil dev (kapil Dev) jab maidan main utarate the to darshakon ke bich maano bijli kaundh jaati thi
 Whether Kapil was bowling or batting, he was the center of attraction among the audience
 yah vishwa cricket kaa saubhaahgya hi kaha jayega ki chaar sarvshereshth olerounder-england ke ian botham, pakistan ke imran khan, newjiland ke richard hadlee or bharat ke kapil dev ne ek hi daur main cricket khelaa or kai baar apane ekatarfa pradarshan se match kaa nateeja palatakar rakh diya
 Long before Sourav Ganguly, Kapil Dev as the captain is credited with bringing an aggressive attitude to the Indian team
 6 janvari 1959 ko janme kapil mauka padane par saahasik faisle lene se nahin chookte the
 It is another matter that the Indian team at that time was weak in terms of bowling and their decisions did not prove to be fruitful for the team on most occasions
 apni isi saahasik captaini kii badaulat kapil ne worldcup 1983 main team india ko champion banaakar har kisi ko chaunkaaya tha
 In this World Cup, Kapil scored 175 * runs against Zimbabwe under odd conditions
 tippaniyan From the Indian side, only four bowlers have been able to register a hat-trick (three wickets off three balls) in international cricket and Kapil is one of them
 kapil ne varsh 1991 main kolkata ke eden gardens main srilanka ke khilaaf vanade main yah karnama kiya tha
 Before Kapil, Chetan Sharma of his own state Haryana registered a hat-trick in odis
 in donon boleron ke alaava test cricket main harbhajan singh va irfan pathan hetric le chuke hai
 This hat-trick of Kapil was different from the three other Indian bowlers (test and ODI) in the sense that he completed this 'trio' in two overs
 janvari 1991 ko kolkata ke eden gardens main srilanka ke khilaaf asia cap ke final main kapildev ne apane ek over kii aakhri gend par srilanka ke roshan mahanama ko wicketiper kiran more se kaich karaayaa
 After this, Ramesh Ratnayake and Sanath Jayasuriya took wickets on the first two balls of the next over
 do overon kii lagaataar teen gendon par yah hetric is andaaj main darj hui thi ki maidan par maujuud darshak or tivi dekh rahe cricketpremiyon ko bhi kaaphi der tak iskaa ahsaas nahin ho paaya tha
 Apart from Kapil, three other Indian bowlers Chetan Sharma (ODI) and Harbhajan Singh and Irfan Pathan (test) scored their hat-trick from three consecutive balls of the same over
 chetan sharma ne apni hetric newjiland ke khilaaf reliance worldcup-1987 main nagpur main darj kii thi
 Similarly, in the test, Harbhajan took a hat-trick against Australia in Kolkata in 2001 and Irfan Pathan against Pakistan in Karachi in 2006
 saurav ganguli se bahut pehle, captain ke taur par kapil dev ko bhartiya team main aakraamak ravaiya laane kaa shrey jaataa he
 Born on 6 January 1959, Kapil did not miss a bold decision when he had the chance
 yah alag baat he ki us samay kii bhartiya team gendbaaji ke lihaaj se kamjor thi or unke yah faisle zyaadaatar maukon par team ke liye faldaayi sabit nahin ho pate the
 Thanks to this same adventure, Kapil surprised everyone by making Team India the champion in World Cup 1983
 is worldcup main kapil ne zimbabwe ke khilaaf visham paristhitiyon main 175* ran kii pari bhi kheli thi
 The comments bharat kii ore se international cricket main ab tak keval chaar gendbaaj hi hetric (teen gend par teen wicket) darj kar paae hai or kapil unamem se ek hai
 Kapil did this feat in the ODI against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens, Kolkata in 1991
 kapil se pehle unke hi rajya haryana ke chetan sharma ne vanade main hetric darj kii thi
 Apart from these two bowlers, Harbhajan Singh and Irfan Pathan have taken hat-trick in Test cricket
 kapil kii yah hetric teen anya bhartiya gendbaajon (test or vanade) ke mukaable is myne main alag rahi ki unhone do over main yah 'tikdi' puri kii thi
 In January 1991, in the final of the Asia Cup against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, Kapil Dev caught Sri Lanka's Roshan Mahanama with wicketkeeper Kiran More on the last ball of his one over
 iske baad agle over kii pehali do gendo par rumesh ratnayake or sanath jayasoorya ke wicket jatke
 This hat-trick was recorded on three consecutive balls of two overs in such a manner that even the spectators on the field and watching the cricket fans could not realize it for a long time
 kapil ke alaava teen anya bhartiya gendbaajon chetan sharma (vanade) or harbhajan singh va irfan pathan (test) ne apni hetric ek hi over kii lagaataar teen gendon par banaai thi
 Chetan Sharma registered his hat-trick against New Zealand in Nagpur in Reliance World Cup-1987
 isi tarah test main harbhajan ne australia ke khilaaf varsh 2001 main kolkata main or irfan pathan ne pakistan ke khilaaf varsh 2006 main karachi main hetric lee thi
 From the Indian side, only four bowlers have been able to register a hat-trick (three wickets off three balls) in international cricket and Kapil is one of them

 Addressing the international conference 'tagore's Vision of the Contemporary World' organized by the ICCR here, the minister referred to the lines of Gurudev's literary works and conveyed his message of peace and love

 The world's most wanted terrorist and the perpetrator of the Mumbai attack, Hafiz Saeed, is now behind bars
 buudhvaar ko pakistan kii counter terarysm team ne jamaat-ud-daawa ke is pramukh ko gujranvala jane se pehle giraftaar kar liya
 Now what is the intention behind Pakistan, it is not clear but if we look at its history, it is a show
 ab is baar jo giraftaar kii tasviir saamne ai he, wo bhi kuch aisi hi he
 Because he is being taken away from home as if he was being rescued and taken somewhere
 buudhvaar ko giraftaar ke baad hafiz said ke jo vijual sabase pehle saamne aae, unamem uske ghar se kadi suraksha main le jaaya ja rahaa tha
 According to Pakistani news, he has been kept in Kot Lakhpat Jail in Lahore
 jab use nikaala gaya to uske aasapaas guard maujuud the, uskaa staff bhi saath hi chal rahaa tha or hafiz said khud bhi thaath ke saath aage badhata nazar aayaa

 haalanki, is baar sirf itnaa hi alag he ki wo najarband yaa house arest nahin balki jail ke andar he
 It is also surprising that this arrest of Hafiz has not been done in the case of Mumbai attack but in some other terror funding and money laundering case

 gandhivadi anna hazarene sarkaar par lokapal vidheyak ke mudde par ‘vaadon se mukarne’ kaa aarope lagaate hue 16 agast se phir anshan karne kii chetavanee di
 At the same time, the government said that it cannot allow a 'parallel' structure to be ready
 donon pakshon dwaara rukh or kadaa kiye jane ke bich sarkaar ne spasht kar diya ki vah 30 june tak lokapal vidheyak kaa ‘sakht or purajor’ masauda taiyaar kar legaa, phir chaahe samaaj ke sadsy sahyog karen yaa nahin karen
 At the joint draft committee meeting on June 15, after the deadlock between the two sides deepened, Hazare alleged that the government had no intention of enacting a strong anti-corruption law
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar samaaj ke sadasyon ke sabhi sujhaavon ko maanane ke apane vaade se mukar rahi he
 In April, Hazare, who is on a fast in the country and bringing the government in concern, said that if he tried to bring a weak bill, he would fast from August 16
 hazaare or unke saathi kaaryakartaaon ke samvaadadaata sammelan ke turant baad lokapal masauda samiti main centre ke pratinidhi ke taur par shaamil grih mantri pi
 Chidambaram, Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal and Water Resources Minister Salman Khurshid also took a press conference and lashed out at the members of the society
 mantriyon ne spasht kar diya ki sarkaar anshan jaisi dhamkiyon ke aage nahin jhukegi
 Sibal said, 'you cannot threaten us and negotiate on the other side
 yah aage badhane kaa tarika nahin he
 The government will not allow the issue to divert its attention due to insults and false condemnations
 ’chidambaram ne kaha, ‘mujhe nahin lagata ki anshan karnaa duniya main kahin bhi kisi vidheyak kaa masauda banavaane kaa tarika he
 Chidambaram said that most of the demands of the Hazare side cannot be accepted as the government cannot allow any parallel structure to stand
 sibbal ne bhi kaha, ‘ham sarkaar se itar ek aisi samanaantar sarkaar nirmit nahin hone de sakate jo sarkaar ke har kaamkaaj ko niyantrit kare
 There are serious differences between us (the government and the Hazare side) on this issue
 chidambaram ne kaha ki samvidhan kii buniyadi baton ko nahin badla ja saktaa or raajnneetik prakriya kaa sammaan karnaa hoga
 He said, 'law makes Parliament
 congress akeli nirvaachit party nahin he
 There are many other parties too

 There is a difference between what is wanted and what is possible
 ’ek prabhaavshaalee lokapal vidheyak taiyaar karne kii sarkaar kii patibaddhta ko doharaate hue sibbal ne kaha, ‘ek baar agar sansad paarit kar de to desh ke adhiktar log kahenge ki acha kaam kiya gaya he
 On the demand for giving authority to the 11-member Lokpal to investigate against bureaucrats, Sibal said, "how can the government distribute its power in an uncontrolled manner
" ’unhone kaha ki agar ye shaktiyaan lokapal ko de di gayin to naukarshah sarkaar ke bajaay lokapal ke prati vafaadaar ho jaayenge
 Sibal said, 'we are against such a change in infrastructure
 ’ unhone kaha ki sanyukt masauda samiti kii baithak main ‘charchaa’ hui thi jise hazaare paksh ke aarope ke tahat ‘nirnay’ nahin qaraar diya ja saktaa
 Chidambaram also rejected the demand for a referendum on the Lokpal Bill, saying that no such measures were mentioned in the Constitution
 unhone aashcharya jataayaa ki kya is tarah ke vidheyak ko praavdhaan-dar-praavdhaan vot karne ke liye rakhaa ja saktaa he
 The ministers cautioned about making Lokpal the most powerful body and said that if Lokpal or its officials are corrupt then how will they be controlled
 pradhanmantri ko lokapal ke daayre main laane ke vivaadaaspad mudde par chidambaram ne kaha ki is bare main kai sari sambhaavnaaen hai
 This can be done with clearly defined exceptions or after the person leaves office
 unhone kaha, ‘is bare main koi faisla nahin hua he
 This is a matter of discussion
 ’ sibbal ne kaha ki pradhanmantri sansadeey loktantr kaa centre bindu hote hai
 If charges are leveled against the Prime Minister, he will not be able to work till the investigation
 unhone kaha, ‘is bich, aap santhaan kii vishwasaneeyata bhi kho denge
 They can see the Prime Minister as a person but we see the Prime Minister as an institution
 ham santhaan ko bachaaye rakhana chaahate hai
 On the other hand, Anna Hazare expressed surprise at the government's decision to send two versions of the Lokpal draft bill to the Cabinet
 unhone kaha, ‘aashcharya he ki sarkaar cabinet ke paas masaude ke do alag-alag sanskaran bhejne kii baat kah rahi he
 If this was to be done, what was the rationale for the formation of the Lokpal Drafting Committee
 itnaa samay barbaad kyon kiya gaya
 This shows that the government has no intention of preparing an effective legislation
 sarkaar bhrashtachar ko khatm nahin karnaa chaahati
 "when i went on hunger strike in April, the government promised to accept all our suggestions," Hazare alleged at the press conference
 ab sarkaar apane vaadon se mukar rahi he
 If a weak bill is brought, i will fast on Jantar Mantar from August 16

 Is this why the never-sleeping city is sleepy today? At first glance it seems that Kolkata is not interested in the 2014 general elections
 1977 se is shahar main bas standon se lekar chaay kii dukaanon tak har jagah laal-jhande, hansiya, hathaudaa or sitare-rang se rangi hoti thi
 But when Mamata Banerjee wiped out the Left Front in the 2011 assembly elections, Kolkata was dominated by green, orange, blue and white, the favorite colors of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief

 He does not remember exactly what Modi said in his speech but he remembers one of his sentences well, "aami Tomayi Bhalobashi
" ’’ ranjan ne usee vakt faisla kar liya tha ki bijepi ke netaa ‘‘achche aadmi’’ hai
 According to political expert Indranil Gupta, BJP will definitely make a dent in anti-left Front votes this time
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘bijepi ke voton main nishchit rup se ijapha hoga
 It remains to be seen whether it translates into winning seats
 ’’ june, 2013 main haavda loksabhaa up-chunaav ne bhavishya kaa sanket de diya thatrinmul ne congress se gathjod nahin kiya tha, party ne seat to bachaa lee, lekin uskaa vot pratishat neeche aa gaya tha

 But now a sense of resentment is also being felt in the air
 jis mahila ne kolkata ko landan banane kaa vaada kiya tha, usne abhi tak kuch khaas nahin kiya he, sirf trishul jaise street lampon ko chhodkar
 Businessmen consider his talk of promoting investment in the state as completely superficial
 singur or nandigram ke muddon ko chhod dene kii vajah se kisaanon or musalamaanon main kaaphi naaraazgi he
 Above all, the Shraddha scam and the deposit payment default crisis have added to the resentment

 Most women are fond of makeup
 lekin garmi ke mausam main mechap ko fresh rakhana apane aap main hi ek bada chalange he
 Actually, excessive sweating in the summer season causes the makeup to deteriorate quickly
 kai logon kii skin par laal chakatte padane lagate hai
 Make-up in the summer season is a problem for every woman
 lekin ab aapako pareshaan hone kii jarurat nahin he, kyonki aaj ham aapako kuch tips bataa rahe hai, jinaki madad se aap garmi main bhi apane mechap ko fresh rakh sakengi
 1
 moischarizer se mechap shuru karen-mausam garmi kaa ho yaa sardi kaa, skin ko komal banaae rakhane ke liye moischarizer bahut jaruri hota he
 But always use oil free moisturizer in summer season
 saath hi oil free foundation hi lagaaein
 2
 sanscreen jarur lagaaein- chilchilaati dhoop se skin damege ko bachaane ke liye sanscreen jarur lagaaein
 Use sunscreen before applying makeup
 bataa den, sanscreen kaa asar 2 se dhai ghante tak hi rahata he
 So before going out in the sun, keep this in mind
 3
 Primer is essential - After moisturizer, apply primer on face
 primer lagane se mechap lambey samay tak fresh rahata he
 This makes facial wrinkles less visible, as well as pores are covered
 4
 Glow your face with bronzer - Bronzer has an important role in showing fresh in the scorching heat of summer
 mechap artist ke mutabik, bronger kaa istemaal keval chehre ke hai point par hi karnaa chahie, jahaan suraj kii sidhi kirane padati hai, jaise- maathaa, chin, naak aadi
 5
 kam mechap products kaa istemaal karen-kai mahilaon kaa mechap bahut jaldi keki lagane lagata he
 To avoid this, at least use makeup products
 6
 Stay away from Shimmer - Most women love the Gloi makeup look
 lekin natural gloi mechap or jarurat se zyada shimer istemaal kar ke mechap ko gloi banane main antar hota he
 Avoid applying cream foundation in the summer season, as it causes excessive sweating on the face and spoils makeup quickly

 - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) May 14, 2018 Taran Adarsh had already described Alia's film as a hit
 unhone ye bhi likhaa ki somvaar ko is film kii kamai ke aankade tay karenge ki ye film wyk days main kitna collection kar sakati he
 If the film had a good collection in Week Days, then this film could prove to be a super hit
 'it’s about the all-important Mon
 
 
 # Raaziis already a HIT, but the numbers on Mon will give an idea of how it is likely to trend on weekdays
 
 
 If the film holds on strong levels on weekdays and beyond, which is likely, it will emerge a SUPER-HIT
 - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) May 14, 2018 The 5th biggest weekend opener of the year 2018, Rajaliya, in his persuasion proved that no star is needed to bring the audience to theaters
 naa sirf aalia kii parformens kii tarif ho rahi he balki filmon ko lekar unki chwwis bhi kamaal kii he
 Alia's stardom can be gauged from the fact that in just three days, her film has also earned a big record of the year
 film kaa bajet lagbhag 30 karod bataaya ja rahaa he or khabaron ke mutabik film ke digital ritis or satellite pehle hi beche ja chuke hai
