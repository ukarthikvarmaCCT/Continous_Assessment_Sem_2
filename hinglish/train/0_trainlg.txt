 National grid or e-court is for information, but whether these facilities can fill the shortage of judges

 After this, go home and rest for one and a half hours

 In addition to filing cases, listening to the cases filed, writing judgments, they also have other administrative functions
 unki puri kshamta is baat par aanki jaati he ki kitni tezi se ve cese ko sun lete hai, samaj lete hai or faisla dete hai
 The promotion of judges of lower courts depends on how many cases have been dealt
 kya koi jaj ek din main 50 file pard saktaa he
 Judges work from seven in the morning to 11 in the night, then on the day of the holiday
 to kya yah thik he ki unki chuttee par nazar daali jaae
 Chief Justice TS Thakur said that we do not just go to Manali
 jo sanvaidhanik peeth ke jaj hote hai wo apane faisle likh rahe hote hai
 If one side is ready then the other side is not ready
 baar se poochhate hai ki kya wo taiyaar hai
 There is a three-week holiday

 The question is whether the number of judges will be eliminated by the termination of leave
 40 hazaar jaj chahie
 There are close to eight thousand judges
 kya is kami ko teen yaa chaar hafte kii chuttee ghataakar puri kii ja sakati he
 Is it possible for a judge to look at the file of twenty cases in a day

 7 april ko pradeep thakur ne 'times of india' main likhaa he ki ek adhyayan ke anusaar hai court ke jaj ke paas ek mukademe ke liye bas paanch yaa chah minute hi hote hai
 This is the first time such a study has taken place
 jo sabase vyast jaj hai yani jiske paas bahut cese hai uske paas ek cese ko sunne ke liye sirf dhai minute hai
 The one who is least busy has only 15 to 16 minutes
 paanch se chah minute main unhen faisla dena hota he
 Daksha is an institution in Bangalore, he has done this study
 misaal ke taur par kolkata hai court main har din ek jaj ke paas 163 mukademe sunwaayee ke liye aate hai
 The same time is two minutes for a case
 patna, hyderabad, jharkhand, rajasthan ke jajon ke paas har din ek cese ke liye do se teen minute miltaa he
 Is 619 judges of higher and higher offices sufficient for a population of one billion 25 crore
 tippaniyan Anyone would feel that someone is joking with him
 aap sochiye ki aapke saath koun mazaaq kar rahaa he
 After all, why did the governments not increase the number of judges
 adaalaton main suvidhaayen kyon nahin badhaai
 Who is keeping you away from justice
 ek aadmi adaalaton main chalis chalis saal faisle ke liye intazaar karata he
 No judge has two minutes to make his decision
 uskaa intazaar faisle ke liye kam hota he
 If you get that two minutes of your judge in thirty forty years, it is for him
 kya iskaa samaadhaan mukademon kii suchi banane se nikalegaa yaa jajon kii sankhya badhaane se yah sawaal to bahut aasaan he
 Please answer yourself

 People of western Uttar Pradesh have been demanding a bench for themselves since

 The Chief Justice also included that the facilities and structures of the courts also have to be taken care of
 meerut ke ek kisaan kii vyathaa he ki ek mukademe ne uski zindagi kis tarah se badal di
 The Allahabad High Court affair with Meerut has ruined him
 chif justise ne kaha, 'wo poochhate the sawaal ki agar ek sadak 5 aadmi 10 din main banaate hai, vahi sadak agar ek din main banani ho to kitne aadmi chahie
 And the answer was, 50 people is needed
 3868000 cese ko nipataane ke liye kitne aadmi chahie
 How many judges are needed
 ye baat ham kyon nahin samajhate
 In the way of explaining the Fifth Pass, he gave it, but he did not pay any attention to the man who has to suffer the lack of judges
 desh bhar main nyaaypalika ke muddon ko lekar tarah-tarah ke hai profile sammelan hote rahete hai
 In which sometimes the Chief Minister and sometimes the Prime Minister and sometimes the Chief Justice keep going
 har sammelan main aisi baat kahi ja rahi he magar dedh dashak se kahi ja rahi he phir bhi paryaapt sudhaar nahin hue hai
 In the month of March itself, the Prime Minister himself expressed concern about the pending cases in the centenary celebrations of the establishment of Patna High Court
 patna main pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki meri ek salaah he, or yah idia mujhe abhi-abhi aayaa he ki hamaari adaalaton ko har saal ek bulatin lekar aani chahie jisamen sabase puraane mukademon ko hilite kiya gaya ho
 Some may be forty years old, some may also be 50 years old
 isse logon main ek samvedansheeltaa jaagegi ki kitne saare mukademen hai jo lambit hai
 This will create an atmosphere of how to solve these other cases
 lambit mukademon kii jaankaree ke prati maahaul to dashakon se ban rahaa he
 Reports come in newspapers every day
 sammelnon main charchaa hoti rahati he
 The question is whether the appointment or number of judges will increase or will it improve only with sensitivity or awareness
 26 aktubar 2009 ke hindu akhbaar kii report ke anusaar tab ke kanoon mantri virappa moili ne kaha tha ki sabhi lambit mukademon ko 30 november 2009 neshnal greed par daal diya jayega
 There is a full figure of pending lawsuits on the national grid
 agar aap NJDG, neshnal judicial data greed ke naam se search karenge to ek pej khulegaa jis par aaj ke samay tak ke saare mukademon kii suchi mil jaaegi
 If we looked at the data till Monday evening 10 saalon se adhik lambit mukademon kii sankhya bharat main 22 lakh 58 hazaar 441 hai
 The number of cases pending between 5 and 10 years is 38 lakh, 28 thousand 117
 zaahir he lambit mukademon ke bare main jaanane ke zariyaa hamaare paas uplabdh he
 Apart from the National Data Grid, you can see the status of the lawsuits of all the courts across the country online by visiting the site of the e-court
 neshnal greed yaa i court jaankaree ke liye he lekin kya ye suvidhaayen jajon kii kami ko puri kar sakati hai
 The Chief Justice clearly stated that the solution is to increase the number of judges
 jo naam hamane bheje hai unhen manzur karne main do-do maheene na lage
 If there is any objection, talk to us directly because the collegium which appointed the judges has finalized the names as part of the long process
 2010 main centre ne tay kiya tha ki ek rashtriya litigeshan niti laai jaaegi jiske tahat rajyon ko apane sarkari mukademon kii sankhya kam kerani thi lekin 2015 tak kii antim soochna ke hisaab se is par cabinut vichaar kar rahi he
 On the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Allahabad Court in March itself, President Pranab Mukherjee said that delay in justice is unfair
 jajon kii sankhya badhaani chahie or khaali padon ko jaldi bharna chahie
 We wanted to know how much the judges really do
 hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne apane str par pataa kar bataaya ki supreme court ke kisi jaj ko kitna kaam karnaa padataa he
 i wish we could shoot a judge's entire routine with the camera and show you
 mujhe to sunakar yakeen nahin hua ki jaj sahab kaam ke alaava koi kaam nahin kar pate hai
 One should file a public interest litigation for how to breathe
 ashish ne bataaya ki ek jaj ko rozaana 18 ghante kaam karnaa padataa he
 Remains in the court from ten to four in the morning
 iske baad ghar jaakar dedh ghante aaraam karte hai
 Then they start preparing for the next day's lawsuits
 har mukademe kii file dekhni hoti he
 a file is of 100 pages and some of fifty pages
 iske bich faisla bhi dictate karnaa hota he
 Go to sleep by half past eleven and wake up at five o'clock
 jajon ko tahalnaa acha lagata he
 After a walk from seven to eight in the morning, then prepare the case again
 saadhe nau baje ke aas paas court ke liye nikal jate hai
 Many judges also work late nights on Saturdays and Sundays
 mukademon ko daakhil karnaa, daakhil hue mukademon ko sunanaa, faisla likhane ke alaava unke anya prashasnic kaam bhi hote hai
 Their full potential is judged on how fast they listen to the case, understand it and pass judgment
 nichali adaalaton ke jajon kaa pramotion to inhen baton par tikaa hota he ki kitne cese ko niptaya he
 Can a judge read 50 files in a day
 subah saat baje se raat ke 11 baje tak jaj kaam karte hai, phir chuttee ke din bhi
 So is it okay to look at their vacation? chif justise tii es thakur ne kaha ki ham sirf manali nahin jate hai
 Those who are judges of constitutional bench are writing their decisions
 agar ek paksh taiyaar he to doosraa paksh taiyaar nahin he
 Ask Bar whether he is ready
 teen hafte kii chuttee hoti he
 During this time also some judges listen to the cases
 sawaal he ki kya chuttee samaapt kar dene se jajon kii sankhya kii zarurat samaapt ho jaaegi
 40 thousand judges are required
 aath hazaar ke kareeb jaj hai
 Can this deficiency be reduced by reducing the leave to three or four weeks
 kya ye mumkin hai ki koi jaj ek din main bees mukademon kii file dekh le
 He has to listen to both sides, read the law and write the decision
 bich-bich main shakespeare ko bhi kot karnaa hota he
 Now i understand why our judges continue to quote Shakespeare
 duusare kisi ko padhane kaa vakt hi nahin miltaa hoga
 The Supreme Court of America has 9 judges
 sabko milakar ek saal main 81 keson main faisla dena hota he
 In India, a judge hears an average of 2600 lawsuits, passing judgment
 chif justise ne kaha ki jab baahar se jaj aate hai to hamen dekhakar hairaan hote hai
 On 7 April, Pradeep Thakur wrote in the 'times of India' that according to a study, a High Court judge has only five or six minutes for a trial
 pehali baar aisa adhyayan hua he
 The busiest judge, that is, he who has a lot of cases, has only two and a half minutes to hear a case
 jo sabase kam vyast he uske paas maatr 15 se 16 minute hai
 They have to give a decision in five to six minutes
 bangaloru kii ek sanstha he daksh usne ye adhyayan kiya he
 For example, 163 judges come to the Kolkata High Court every day for a hearing
 ek cese ke liye do minute jitna hi samay hota he
 The judges of Patna, Hyderabad, Jharkhand, Rajasthan get two to three minutes for a case every day
 kya ek arab 25 karod kii aabaadi ke liye ucch or ucchtam nyaalayon ke 619 jaj paryaapt he
 The comments kisi ko bhi lagegaa ki uske saath koi mazaaq kar rahaa he
 Think who is joking with you
 aakhir sarkaron ne jajon kii sankhya kyon nahin badhaai
 Why did the facilities in the courts not be increased
 aapako insaaf se koun dur rakh rahaa he
 a man waits for forty years in the courts for a verdict
 uske faisle ke liye kisi jaj ke paas do minute kaa vakt nahin he
 His wait for decision is short
 tees chalis saal main jaj sahab kaa wo do minute mil jaae, uske liye hota he
 Will the solution come out of making a list of cases or is this question very easy by increasing the number of judges
 jawaab aap khud dijie
 The condition of Uttar Pradesh is worse
 pashchim uttar pradesh ke log kab se apane liye ek bench kii maang kar rahe hai
 Everything is sold from here on its way to Lucknow and Allahabad

 In the country and state, over 100 families who became Muslims by reading the Kalma and Namaz under the lotus government, some goons attacked the name of religion in the night, but the big leaders of BJP and saffron organizations, seeing the opportunity, kept calm
 The strategy to stay is adopted
 unki yah khamoshi isliye mahatvapurn he ki centre main narendra modi sarkaar banane ke baad bhagava sanghathanon ne desh bhar main 'ghar vaapasi' abhiyaan chalaa rakhaa he, jisamen musalamaanon ko hindu banane kii pahal kii jaati he
 The government is systematically silent and grassroots activists are vocal on this issue
 philhal nae bane ye musalmaan croatia kii safed topi lagaae jantar mantar par date hai or hindu sanghathan parade ke peeche se unhen samajhane or dhamkaane kii mudra main hai
 Hindu organizations hope that they will get success in the new version of 'ghar Wapsi'
 sach yah he ki pichley teen saal se ho rahi apane andolan kii ansuni ne jantar mantar par date hisar ke bhagana gaanv ke daliton ke gusse ko or bhadkaa diya he
 Along with changing the dress, they have also changed their names
 masalan gundon ke hamale main haath tudwa chuke satish kajala kaa naam ab abdul kalam ho gaya he, vahiin deepak kajala ab umr abdulla or ritu ab fatima ban gai hai
 Virender Singh Bagoria, who is spearheading the Dalit movement of Mirchpur, Phugana and now Bhagana, has not changed his name yet, but to prove himself a Muslim by heart, he says that he has named his son 21 years ago
 Akbar had kept it

 Dalits complain that after a violent dispute with the Jats in 2012, they left the village and staged an indecent strike on the steps of the office of Hisar deputy commissioner, instead of accepting their demands, they were thrown out of the Mini Secretariat

 bagoriya kehete hai, ''hindu vyavastha main ham dalit hai, isliye peedit hai
 Through conversion, the suffering of Dalits will be revealed to the country
 '' apane saathiyon kii sahmati ke bich bagoriya kehete hai, ''islam main sab ek saath kalma pard sakate hai
 Like Hinduism, we are not inferior here nor are we slaves of Hindus
 '' vaise, ve is sawaal ko taal dete hai ki bharat main to islam main bhi jati vyavastha aa gai he, nahin to pasmanda musalmaan kahaan se aate
 However, the attitude of Dalits is strong, hence the attitude of Hindutvaists who are generally in the fast is soft
 gorakhpur se bijepi saansad yogi adityanath apane ugr bayanon ke liye charchaa main rahete hai, lekin is mudde par unka koi saarvajanik bayaan nahin aayaa
 Yogi told India Today in unimaginative terms, "congress's Haryana government has been stuck in the case of Dalits for three years
 hamen daliton kii samasyaon ko samvedansheeltaa or teji se dekhnaa hoga
 He told that Hindu organizations are taking this matter seriously and their people are constantly in touch with the fasting new Muslims
 unki 'ghar vaapasi' kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 At the same time Yogi said, "but Dalits should not have adopted the path of conversion to raise their demand
 yah ek tarah kii blakemeling he
 Anyway, after changing religion, Dalits will not get the benefit of reservation given by Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the creator of the Constitution
 '' iske alaava gorakshpith ke mahant sarkaar se dharm parivartan ke khilaaf sakht kanoon laane kii maang bhi kar rahe hai
 In this innovative way of Dalits to make their demands, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad's international CEO Pravin Togadia, who has started Trishul initiation from all over the country, also does not understand that the poster boy of Hindutva like Narendra Modi can sit on the chair of the Prime Minister
 Despite how they react to the incident that happened on the Parliament Street
 maamle par saarvajanik bayaan to khayr unhone nahin hi diya, india today ke baar-baar kuredne par unhone jawaab dene kii jimmedaari viechpi ke sanyukt mahasachiv surendra jain par daal di
 Jain said in a clean manner, "to think that we are silent on this issue is wrong
" main khud chaar din tak hisar main rahaa or bhagana main hui mahapanchayat main shaamil tha
 "the meeting of two-and-a-half hundred people held on August 9 is being called a mahapanchayat
 is baithak ke baad kaha gaya ki agar daliton ne ghar vaapasi nahin kii to unhen gaanv main ghusane nahin diya jayega
 Jain says, "this conversion is completely illegal
" blakemeling ke jariye apni maangen manwaane ke liye dharmantaran fishan jaisaa ho gaya he
 If one looks at a similar unsuccessful attempt at conversion at Rampur in Uttar Pradesh two months ago, it seems certain that conversion has emerged as a new tool of legitimate or illegitimate protest
 rampur main daliton ne atikaraman kar banaae gaye gharon par sarkari bulldozer chalane se bachaane ke liye dharmantaran kaa faisla kiya tha
 However, Azam Khan, who is considered to be the Muslim face of the Uttar Pradesh government, did not allow conversion in his city, but drove the Maulvi away from there
 taaja ghatnakram par ajam ne india today se kaha, ''jantar mantar majahab badalane kii jagah nahin he
 Religion is a living thing in the heart
 kal koi raashtrapati bhawan main jaakar baith jayega or kahegaa ham is par kabja karenge, nahin to musalmaan ban jaaenge, to kya unki blakemeling maan lee jaaegi
 Raising his point, Azam said, "it would be better for the governments to pay serious attention to the problems of Dalits and increase their status in the society
" hindu dharm ke swayambhu rahanuma bhi apane bhaaiyon ke dard ko samajhen
 "this pain is deep and very old
 'ghar vaapasi' ke sawaal par bhagoriya ne kaha, ''hisar main rahane ke liye plot mili
 We received the check from the village
 hinduon ke chaar dham main se do dham hamen saunpe jaaen, to ham ghar vaapasi par vichaar karenge
 He also admitted that Hindu leaders are in touch with him
 saath hi kuch muslim netaa bhi unase sampark banaae hue hai
 At present, the other Jantar Mantar protesters are also watching the storm of the cup

 hairat kii baat ye rahi ki is iklaute fain kii taaliyaan puri kushti ke dauraan chah minute tak bajati raheen
 Perhaps the only Sardar's applause could not show much effect
 jis toornament main qareeb 300 athlete hissaa le rahe hai vahaan fans kii sankhya mushkil se sau bhi nahin pahunch paa raheen
 There are several reasons why Sakshi won the silver
 rio olympic kii kamyaabi ke baad sakshi kaa zyaadaatar vakt samaaroh kii shobhaa badhaane main beetaa
 She could not come to this tournament with much preparation
 58 kilogram varg main kushti ladane vaali sakshi kaa vajan badhane kii vajah se unhen 60 kilogram varg main ladanaa padaa
 In the final, he competed with the Japanese wrestler who won the gold medal in the 63 kg category (risako Kawai of Japan)
 riyako vajan ghataakar 60 kilogram main ladane ain uskaa phayda bhi unhen jarur mila
 Risako defeated Sakshi 10–0
 lekin kushti kaa ye scorcard cricket ke scorcard se behad alag he
 The efforts of the witness and all the other reasons are not visible in this
 tippaniyan Olympic medalist Sakshi Malik was believed to be the biggest star attraction at the Asian Championships to be held in Delhi
 sakshi ke alaava do fogaat bahanon (vinish or ritu fogaat) ne bhi toornament ke tisare din padak jite
 But the audience shortage continued
 phir bhi gold naa milane ko lekar fans shikaayat jarur karte hai media surkhiyaan banaakar nishaanaa banane se nahin chooktin
 The media also does not want to mention that millions of people went to the theater to watch the riot film which earned Rs 700 crores
 lekin asli dangal se fans chhitakate rahe
 Sakshi Malik, who was successful in Rio Olympics, reached the final of the Asian Championship after about 8 months, many experts started raising great hopes
 sakshi ye kehete hue warm ap aria main waapas ain, "pehle silver ke liye bhi log tarasate the
 
 
 If you live now 
 
 
 "sakshi promised in a special conversation with NDTV that Fans would see the real Sakshi at the next World Championship

 But three women wrestlers of India continued to perform well for gold in the finals of the Asian Championship in the country's capital Delhi, but the fans are missing
 muqablon main bharat kii teen mahila khilaadi final main haar gai
 The media and fans have complained that the players, especially Sakshi, had to be content with the silver medal
 mahila pahalawaanon ne duusare din ek kaansya or teen rajat apane naam kiye, lekin sakshi kii haar kii maayusi badi khabar ban gai
 During the Asian Championships (may 10-14), there are many shortcomings in the event from the player to the event
 lekin japan or mongolia jaise kushti powerhouse tiimon ke saamne bhartiya khilaadiyon ko khud ko aankane kaa mauk bhi mil gaya
 This tournament is a lesson not only for the players and the organizers but also for the fans interested in sports and also for the players and fans who are cursing the system, always hoping for medals
 mana ja rahaa tha ki dilli main ho rahe asian championships main olympic padak vijeta sakshi malik sabase bada star aakarshan banengi
 Apart from Sakshi, two Phogat sisters (vinish and Ritu Phogat) also won medals on the third day of the tournament
 lekin darshakon kii kami khalati rahi
 Nevertheless, Fans complain about not getting gold, and do not miss making headlines by making media headlines
 media bhi ye zikr karnaa nahin chaahati, jis dangal film ne 700 karod rupee kii kamai kii use dekhne lakhon log theatre gaye
 But the Fans continued to disperse from the real riot
 rio olympic main kaamyaab sakshi malik qareeb 8 maheene baad asian championships ke final main pahunchin to kai jaankaar badi ummid baandhne lage
 Sakshi came back to the warm-up area, saying, "people were longing for Silver earlier
 
 
 ab jeeta he to
 
 
 
 " sakshi ne NDTV se khaas baatcheet main vaada kiya ki agali world championships main fans asli sakshi ko dekhenge
 She was apparently not very happy with her performance

 Three of India's women players lost in the finals
 media or phans ko shikaayat he ki khilaadiyon, khaskar sakshi ko silver medal se hi santosh karnaa padaa
 Women wrestlers won one bronze and three silver on their second day, but the disappointment of Sakshi's defeat became big news
 asian championships (10-14 may) ke dauraan khilaadi se lekar aayojan main kai kamiyaan najar aa rahi hai
 But in front of wrestling powerhouse teams like Japan and Mongolia, Indian players also got the opportunity to assess themselves
 ye toornament ek sabak he naa sirf khilaadi or aayojakon ke liye balki khelon main ruchi rakhane vaale phans ke liye or hameshaa padak kii ummid kar khilaadi or system ko kosne vaale phans ke liye bhi

 ipel 10 ke chathe match main gat vijeta sunrisers hyderabad kii takkar gujarat ke liance se hogi
 The match will be played at the Sunrisers Hyderabad home ground from 4 pm
 hyderabad ne apane pehle match main bangalore ko 35 ran se maat dekar jeet ke saath shuruyaat kii, vahiin suresh ranpa kii gujarat team ko bada score banane ke baad bhi kolkata se 10 wicket kii karaari haar mili
 It is obvious that Gujarat is trying to win and open an account in the points table and for this the team will expect better performance from their bowlers
 duusari or hyderabad jeet kii lay ko banaae rakhane ke liye taiyaar nazar aa rahi he
 The comments hyderabad ke liye captain david warner kaa karaab form fikr kii baat ho sakati he lekin iske baavjood pichhali baar kii champion team santulit nazar aa rahi he
 In the last match, runs for Hyderabad were scored by Yuvraj Singh (62 runs off 27 balls), Mozes Henriquez (52 runs off 37 balls) and Shikhar Dhawan (40 runs off 31 balls)
 yuvaraj kii pehle hi match main dhuandhar ballebaaji ne warner ko khush kar diya he
 He is hopeful that the bat of this Chandigarh player will continue to blaze in the following matches as well
 agar gendbaazon kii baat kare to afghanistan ke raashid khan (36 ran dekar 2 wicket), bhubaneshwar kumaar (27 ran dekar 2 wicket), ashish nehra (42 ran dekar 2 wicket) wicket nikaale
 On the other hand, Ballebazon of Gujarat performed well against Kolkata
 
 
 lekin gendbaazon ne apane captain suresh raina ko niraash kiya
 Barring Praveen Kumar (2 overs 13 runs, no wickets), the performances of Dhawal Kulkarni (42 runs in 4 overs with no wickets) and Shivil Kaushik (4 overs, 40 runs with no wickets) proved to be forgotten
 donon tiimon ke pehle maichon ko dekhte hue is muqaabale main hyderabad kaa palada baari dikhaai detaa he lekin warner iske baavjood raina kii sena ko kamazor aankane kii galati nahin karnaa chahenge
 Skipper David Warner's poor form for Hyderabad may be a matter of concern, but despite this, the champions of last time look balanced
 pichley match main hyderabad ke liye yuvaraj singh (27 gend par 62 ran), moguej henricez (37 gend par 52 ran) or shikhar dhawan (31 gend par 40 ran) ne ran bangalore ke kilaaf batore
 In the very first match of Yuvraj, the explosive batting has made Warner happy
 unhen ummid he ki aage ke maichon main bhi chandigarh ke is khilaadi kaa balla yun hi dhamal machaata rahegaa
 Speaking of bowlers, Afghanistan's Rashid Khan (2 wickets for 36 runs), Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2 wickets for 27 runs), Ashish Nehra (2 wickets for 42 runs) took wickets
 duusari taraf gujarat ke ballebaazon pradarshan kolkata ke kilaaf acha rahaa
 
 
 But the bowlers disappointed their captain Suresh Raina
 praveen kumaar (2 over 13 ran, koi wicket nahin) ko chhod den to dhaval kulkarni (4 over main 42 ran koi wicket nahin) or shivil kowshik (4 over, 40 ran koi wicket nahin) kaa pradarshan bhula dene vaala sabit hua
 Looking at the first matches of both the teams, Hyderabad have a big edge in this match, but Warner would not like to make the mistake of weakening Raina's army

 " iske baad unhone mandiron khaas kar shivalayon main jal sangrah karne kaa kaam shuru kiya
 The water is passed through several filter chambers before being sent to land
 goud ne kaha ki is pariyojna ke tahat mandiron main jan sahyog se kai tanks or borwell kaa nirmaan karaayaa gaya
 Gaud said, "in some temples, a 30-foot deep pit was required to be dug so that the water of the idols could be collected directly there

 The reason behind this is not a remake song but Ravish Kumar's show 'prime Time' aired on NDTV India on Friday, in which the question was, what to do when questions are not asked? bataa den ki sarkaar dwaara enditivi india par ek din kaa bayaan lagaae jane ke baad prime time main do mim kalakaaron ke saath yah samajhane kii koshish kii gai thi ki jab sarkaar ko sawaalon se samasya hone lage to phir kis tarah ke sawaal satta ko khush karenge - jaise baago main bahaar he? aap baniyaan koun se brands kii pahante hai? yaa aap khate kitni baar hai din main? phool koun sa pasand karte hai, dhatura kaa yaa kanel kaa?tippaniyan Ravish invited two mime artists to his show, one with authority and the other with his lathe

 BJP does not seem to get majority in Haryana assembly elections
 bijepi ko 37 siten milti dikhaai de rahi hai vahiin congress ko 32 siton mil rahi hai
 At the same time, sources are getting news that the Congress has started trying to form a government in Haryana and JJP leader Dushyant Chautala has been offered the post of deputy CM from the party
 lekin chautaala siem pad ke liye ade hue hai
 It is being told that on Wednesday, Dushyant met between Chautala and Deepender Hooda
 haalanki bijepi bhi dushyant chautaala ko apane paale main laane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The Congress will now have to decide whether it will be ready to make Dushyant Chautala the CM to keep the BJP away from power
 lekin yah congress ke liye faisla aasaan nahin hoga or kyonki bhupendra singh hooda jinhone haryana main congress ke liye jamkar mehnat kii he or vah sarkaar main shaamil na hon or agar vah shaamil hon to dushyant chautaala se junior banakar kaam karen
 However, it may take a little longer to clear the picture in Haryana
 lekin yah vishleshan ke liye he ki haryana jaise rajya jahaan bahut badi sankhya main sena or surakshabal main kaam karte hai, kya un par bhi jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataae jane kaa bahut zyada asar nahin hua he or isi ke dam par bijepi daawa kar rahi thi ki use rajya main 75 siten zyada milengi
 On the other hand, the present Chief Minister of Haryana Manohar Lal Khattar will now come to Delhi and he will meet JP Nadda and other leaders here

 What is the story of the film? The story of the film dates back to 1795 India, when India was ruled by the East India Company and many states were in the hands of the British
 lekin ronakpur ek aisa rajya tha jo angrejon kii pakad se dur tha
 The commander there Khuda Bakhsh Jahaji (amitabh Bachchan) took care of his Mirza Sahab (ronit Roy) and the entire state
 kinhin kaarnon se mirza sahab kii mrityu ho jaati he or unki beti jafira (fatima sanaa shaikh) kii puri jimmedaari khudabaksh ke haathon main aa jaati he
 Meanwhile, the story goes on 11 years and then the entry of Firangi Mallah (aamir Khan) who swears by his grandmother can lie to anyone

 relies se pehle film ke viefex ke bare main baat kii ja rahi thi ki usamen kami he
 But one gets to see good VFX while watching the film
 film kaa becoground score bhi badhiya he

 relies se pehle kaha ja rahaa tha ki aamir kaa kairactor english film pirets of carabian se miltaa julata he jabaki ise dekhne ke dauraan aisa bilkul mahasoos nahin hota
 At the time of the film's release, Aamir gets caught in a bad addiction, the wife is a weak link: Direction did a disappointing film
 The weak link is its length which seems to be very long
 ise chota kiya jaataa to film main or bhi rochak hoti
 Even before the release of the film, its songs have not been popular, due to which the buzz which should have been made has not been made
 filmakan ke dauraan bade-bade gane darshaae gaye hai jinhen chota kiya janaa chahie tha
 Climax could have been better
 vijay krishna acharya kaa nirdesan kamjor he
 This film could have been saved from Dhar under the direction
 film kii kahani bhi aisi he jo shaayad sabhi ko pasand naa aae
 The effects of the film are not able to affect the audience, especially those watching English films

 Earlier, Randhir Kapoor had denied all the reports in which Rishi was said to have cancer
 maaloom ho ki rishi kapur ne pichley saal 29 sitambar ko twit kar jaankaree di thi ki ve america medical treetment ke liye ja rahe hai
 But neither the actor nor his family gave any information about which disease he has suffered
 jabase rishi neuyork gaye hai unki patni nitu kapur unke saath hai
 Ranbir Kapoor also goes to New York to take care of his father's health
 rishi kapur kii beemaari kii gambhirtha kaa andaja isi baat se lagata he ki ve pichley saal apni maa krishna raaj kapur kaa nidhan hone ke baad bhi bharat nahin laute the
 Bollywood stars often visit Rishi Kapoor in New York to know him
 Hello all! i am taking a short leave of absence from work to go to America for some medical treatment

 ab jab ye anouns ho gaya he ki rishi kapur cancer free hai, to ummid he jald hi unke desh lautne par kapur parivaar main shehanai guunje
 Well, like Rishi Kapoor, Sonali Bendre and Irrfan Khan too have won the battle against cancer

 The meeting of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Legislature Party continues in the midst of political turmoil
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ensipi (NCP) ke 54 vidhayakon main se 48 vidhayak baithak main hissaa lene pahunche hai
 It was earlier reported that 9 rebel mlas are going to Delhi but later two of them returned to Sharad Pawar
 uske baad 7 vidhayakon ke privet chartered plane se dilli jane kii khabar ai
 But Dhananjay Munde, who was with Ajit Pawar till morning, also reached for the meeting later where he was greeted with applause
 khabar likhe jane tak ajit pavaar (ajit Pawar) samet keval 5 vidhayak party kii vidhayak dal kii baithak main nahin pahunche hai or un par dal badal kanoon ke tahat karrwai ho sakati he
 Earlier in the day-long incident, Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as Chief Minister early in the morning and Ajit Pawar was sworn in as Deputy Chief Minister, which nobody had expected
 uske baad sabase pehle shivasena netaa sanjay raut kii press conference hui or unhone sari kahani ke liye ajit pavaar ko doshi ke rup main pesh kiya
 Sanjay Raut said that Ajit Pawar was already suspected
 raat kii baithak main wo aankh milakar baat nahin kar rahaa tha
 The body language of the person who is talking about doing wrong starts appearing
 raat ke andhere main hi paap kiye jate hai
 Sanjay Raut said that Ajit Pawar has betrayed the people of Maharashtra and the views of Shivaji Maharaj
 sharad pavaar ke saath dhokhaa kiya he
 After Sanjay Raut's press conference, NCP chief leader Sharad Pawar and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray held a joint press conference on the 'mahasiyasi' game in Maharashtra
 sharad pavaar ne kaha ki shivasena kii aguai main ham sabhi ekajute thea or ekajute rahenge
 In the press conference, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said that what we do is done in broad daylight
 bijepi kaa khel sara desh dekh rahaa he
 He said that this is playing on the name of democracy
 press conference main sharad pavaar ne kaha ki ajit pavaar ke paas 54 vidhayakon ke hastakshar vaali chitthee he
 We will take action against Ajit
 unhone kaha ki ajit pavaar se aisi ummid katai nahin thi
 In response to a question asked by journalists, Sharad Pawar said that i have no worries, this has happened to me earlier
 pavaar ne kaha ki hamaare paas number he, sarkaar ham hi banaaenge
 He said that this government would not be able to prove its majority in the House
 ensipi or shivasena kii saajha press conference ke baad congress ke varisht netaa ahamed patel or mallikarjun khadge press conference ke liye aae
 The press conference was started by Ahmed Patel and said that the truth of the claim to form a government in Maharashtra was not investigated
 koi veriphication nahin kiya gaya
 This is the extent of shamelessness
 ahamed patel ne kaha ki sabhi vidhayak hamaare saath hai or bijepi kaa saamana karne ke liye majbootee se saath khadey hai
 He said that it took time to consult the ally party but there was no delay in forming the government
 ahamed patel ne kaha ki aaj subah main jo bhi cond hua uski aalochana karne ke sivaa main mere paas koi shabd nahin he
 Earlier at 8 am, BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis took the position of Chief Minister of Maharashtra with the support of NCP and NCP leader Ajit Pawar took the oath of office as Deputy Chief Minister
 aapako bataa den ki maharashtra vidhansabha kii 288 siton ke liye 21 oktober ko chunaav hue the or 24 oktober ko parinaam aae the
 In the election, BJP got 105 seats, Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44 seats
 kisi bhi party yaa gathbandhan ke sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh nahin karne ke baad 12 november ko rajya main raashtrapati shashan laga diya gaya tha
 After the announcement of the dates of Lok Sabha elections 2019, the tussle has started between the party leaders about the ticket
 bijepi saansad sakshi maharaj(sakshi Maharaj) ne tikat ko lekar apni party ko hi dhamkee de di he
 He wrote a letter to UP BJP President Mahendra Nath Pandey and said that if he was not given a ticket, the result would not be good
 unhone apane patr main likhaa ki unke sansadeey kshetra unnav main obisi matadaataaon kaa pratinidhitiv nahin he
 But he has raised the party with his hard work
 yahiwajah he ki party ne kareeb 15 saal baad 2014 main unnav kii seat jiti thi
 Explain that the Congress has announced the name of its candidate from Unnao seat
 unnav loksabhaa seat se congress ne is baar phir anu tandon ko tikat diya he
 bjp's 'bayanveer' MP Sakshi Maharaj is still an MP from this seat
 jinako saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 518834 vot mili the
 SP was Arun Shank of SP who got 208661 votes
 bispi tisare number par thi jise 200176 vot mili the
 Congress candidate Anu Tandon got 197098 votes
 aapako bataa den ki unnav seat madhya uttar pradesh kii seat he
 Which would also have been influenced by the political mood of Lucknow, Kanpur
 pichhali baar modi lahar main sakshi maharaj ko badi jeet mili thi
 He got more than 43 per cent of the votes while the Samajwadi Party which finished second was only 17
 37 fisadi vot mili
 In the post-independence elections, the Congress continued to win this seat 6 times in a row and a total of 9 times this seat has gone to its account
 saal 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi congress pratyaashee anu tandon ne yahaan par jeet darj kii thi
 bjp's Dev Baksha Singh has also been a three-time MP from this seat
 jabaki ek-ek baar is seat se bispi or samaajawaadee party yahaan se chunaav jeet chuki he
 The Samajwadi Party will field its candidate from here this time under the SP-BSP alliance
 haalanki abhi tak naam tay nahin kiya gaya he
 At the same time, because of his statements of Sakshi Maharaj, he has put many times in the trouble of BJP and PM Modi and in the last five years, he has been deemed many high commanders
 ab dekhne vaali baat yah hogi ki unako party is baar tikat detii he yaa nahin
 It is reported that this time BJP will give ticket again after seeing the report card of mps

 is maukey par inkaar-ikraar ke baad manch par shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare aae lekin unhen pradhanmantri ke bagal vaali kursi phir bhi nahin mil pai
 Interestingly, the Maharashtra government has accepted Shiv Sena Party chief Uddhav Thackeray's insistence on sitting next to PM Modi

 But the Maharashtra government could not fulfill its promise
 vahiin, piem narendra modi ne sabase pehle panwel ke patalganga main enaieses ke nae campus kaa udghaatan kiya
 He then performed Bhoomi Pujan of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's memorial worth 3600 crores in Arabian Sea
 ek tarah se biemasi chunaavon kaa bigul phunkate hue modi ne kaha vikaas kii har mushkilon kaa hal he
 Uddhav Thackeray's obstinacy approved, will get seat next to PM Narendra Modi modi ne apni sarkaar kii peeth thapthapate hue kaha isi manch par jin prakalpon kaa udghaatan hua he, wo lagbhag ek lakh 6 hajaar karod rupee ke project, vikaas ke kaamon kaa shubharambh hota he, ye bahut badi ghatana he jise ham karke dikhaa rahe hai
 Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said on this occasion that in the last 15 years, the government has only announced but could not get approval for any work, we are thankful to the central government who gave all the approvals in just 6 months
 biemasi chunaav ko lekar bad rahi takaraat mumbai mahanagarapalika ke chunaav farvari 2017 main hona he, lekin bijepi-shivasena ke bich gathbandhan hoga yaa nahin ye abhi tak tay nahin he
 However, the war between the two parties continues on the credit for development work

 bhushan ne daleel di thi ki hatya ke maamle main kai nae tathy saamne aae hai jinaki nae sire se jaanch kiye jane kii aavashyaktaa he

 The police and central security forces have decided to kill the Naxalites
 unhen munhtod jawaab dene kii taiyaari joro par he
 But top officials are also worried about the claims of those advocating for human rights
 darasal, jab kabhi bhi naksaliyon ke khilaaf kaarywahi ko lekar suraksha balon ke kadam uthte hai
 At the same time, a special class becomes active on the force regarding human rights violations
 police or suraksha balon par jyadatiyon kaa aarope laga kar unki kaarywahi ko naa keval nazaij tehraaya jaataa he balki use adaalat main bhi chunauti di jaati he
 In Chhattisgarh, the team of anti-naxal operations engaged in the search for Naxalites has raided the jungles, but they are also feared of human rights
 ye wo vir jawan hai jinhone naksaliyon se loha lete hue apane praan nichhaavar kar die
 These soldiers were stationed in Sukma
 in paranksaliyon ne ghaat lagaakar hamalaa kiya
 In their defense, the Naxalites used the villagers as a shield in front of them
 graminon ko bachaane ke liye in javaanon ne pehle fire nahin kiya
 As a result, Naxalite firing took place first and these jawans gained heroic momentum
 lekin bastar se lekar dilli tak naa to kisi maanav adhikaaravaadi sanghathan or uske kaaryakartaaon ne in javaanon ke maanav adhikaron kii raksha kii vakaalat kii or naa hi inhe insaaf dilaane ke liye aawaaj uthaai
 There is no one in Bastar to tell whether the soldiers of the police and central security forces have any human rights
 duusari ore sukama javaanon ko JNU main shradhanjali dene vaale dow buddha singh par bhi hamalaa ho gaya
 Therefore, there has been a lot of debate in Bastar regarding the attitude of human rightists
 bastar main naksalikabhi jan adaalat laga kar nirdosh graminon ko maut ke ghat utaar rahe hai, to kabhi sarkari bhawanon, skulon or sadakon ko barudi surangon se uda rahe hai
 They are also opposing development in this area
 vikaas ke kaamon main madad karne vaale police or kendriya suraksha balon ke javaanon ke alaava sarkari karmchaariyon kii bhi jaan le rahe hai
 In such a situation, no one is knocking on the court for their human rights

 Input from language shila dikshit ke baad aaj unke putr sandip dikshit ne jis tarah se congress chal rahi he, us par joardaar nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha ki isaki 'sambhrantvaadi' samskruti 'ahankaar' paidaa karti he or iske paas sahi myanon main netaa nahin hai
 Sandeep Dixit, son of former MP and Sheila Dixit, also cautioned against imitating BJP or Aam Aadmi Party on economic issues related to secularism
 dikshit ne party main nae laagon ko laane kii joardaar vakaalat karte hue kaha, congress main 50 fisadi senior or enesayuai evam yuva congress main 70 fisadi 'avaanchit' hai
 He said that culture (in Congress) has become elitist and ego thrives
 aisi sthiti main hamaare cader asahaj hai
 Dixit's attack on the party has come at a time when her mother Sheila Dixit yesterday attacked Congress chief ministerial candidate Ajay Maken for the party's embarrassing defeat in the Delhi Assembly elections, which party leaders PC Chacko and Arvinder Was rejected by Singh Lovely
 is par party adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne hastkshep karte hue netaaon ko saarvajanik str par bahes main nahin ulajhane ko kaha
 Sandeep Dixit did not name anyone in his criticism, but it was indirectly a sarcasm on party vice president Rahul Gandhi, when he said that democracy does not start or end only by holding elections in the party
 unhone kaha ki netaaon ko netritv karne dene or loktantr ke kaaryon kii ijaajat dene ke vichaaron se loktantr shuru hota he
 50-year-old Dixit has been a two-time MP
 unhone kaha ki congress ko apane behtareen netaaon or vichaaron, party muddon kii bajaay janata ke muddon kii pahchaan kerani hogi
 Bringing new people in Congress is of paramount importance
 congress main lagbhag 50 fisadi senior or yuva congress evam enesayuai main 70 fisadi avaanchit hai
 He asked the Congress, which has suffered its fifth consecutive electoral defeat, including the recent Delhi elections after the Lok Sabha elections last year, that this party can return to the count only when it can be identified with the issues of people like Mahatma Gandhi
 unhone kaha, ribain kaa chashma pahan kar aap garibon ke saath pahchaan nahin bana sakate
 Congress will have to identify public issues and its best leaders and ideas rather than party issues
 congress main nae logon ko laana sabase zyada mahatvapurn he
 He said that Congress has to bring new people
 ye log chunaav ke jariye nahin, balki chayan ke jariye, nae vichaaron evam muddon ke jariye aaenge

 Under the new rule, the bank's atms can be used free of charge five times a month, while other banks' atms can be used three times free
 bank ne apni website par kaha ki upabhokta isiaisiai bank ke atm par sirf paanch baar atm kaa muft upyog kar sakenge jisamen vittiya yaa gaiyr vittiya upyog shaamil he
 The bank said that after the free transaction limit, customers will have to use Rs 20 per financial transaction in addition to service tax and 8 for every non-financial use
 50 rupee kaa bhugtan karnaa hoga
 Similarly, in six metros - Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore and Hyderabad - the number of free or non-financial free usage per month at atms of banks other than ICICI Bank has been reduced to three, after which the customer 20 for financial transactions and 8 for non-financial transactions
 50 rupee kharch karne honge
 With regard to usage in non-metro areas, customers will be able to use non-icici Bank atms five times free per month, after which there will be a charge
 atm ke upyog kaa mudda behad vivaadaaspad rahaa he kyonki bainkon ko ek duusare ko antar-sambhddhata ke liye shulk adaa karnaa hota he
 Apart from this, after the incidents like robbery at the ATM in Bangalore last year, the operating fee increased, due to which the transaction fee has started to be discussed
 loksabhaa chunaav jaise jaise najadik aate ja rahe hai netaaon ke bich jubaani jang badhati hi ja rahi he
 In such a situation, where did Raj and Uddhav Thackeray stay behind
 somvaar ko raaj thakare ne pune main yojit ek chunavi sabha main shivasena pramukh balasahab thakare or uddhav ko nishaanaa banaaya tha
 Raj had said that after the demise of Shiv Sena chief Balasaheb, senior BJP leaders Nitin Gadkari and Gopinath Munde were in constant touch with him but he could not join the BJP due to Uddhav's opposition
 raaj thakare ke is hamale kaa uddhav ne bhi karaara jawaab diya he
 In the Sena mouthpiece 'saamana', Uddhav said that what would not happen to anyone else who did not happen to Shiv Sena chief Balasaheb Thackeray
 raaj thakare ke ‘is baar shivasena ko aukaat dikhaa duungaa’ vaale bayaan ko saaf taur par sweekaar karte hue uddhav ne kaha ki raaj ko jo bhi aukaat dikhaanaa he dikhaa sakate hai
 Uddhav said 'we are lions and not cats'
 uddhav ne raaj ke balasahab thakare kii samadhi vaale bayaan par bhi apni pratikriya di he
 Uddhav said that LK Advani and Sharad Pawar came to Balasaheb's tomb but Raj did not come even though his house is near the tomb
 uddhav ne raaj thakare kaa jawaab dete hue kaha ki hamane koi bhukhand nahin beche hai lekin agar koi sabit kar degaa to ham raajnneeti chhod denge or builderbaji koun karata he ye sabhi jaanate hai
 Uddhav said, 'people say that we are a regional party but are original
 'jis tarah se uddhav ne raaj thakare ko khari khoti sunai he ab ye dekhnaa hoga ki is chunaav ke mausam main do bhaaiyon ke bich chal rahi jubaani jang or kya-kya rang dikhaati he

 Kriti said, "the biggest reason for the failure of the market place model is the inaccurate data of the retailers"
 hamane ise bhampa or samaj liya ki hamen alag tarah se sochna hoga
 This is the reason that the cancellation rate of our orders is very low
 sumit ne kaha, 'apane model or oparations ke chalate ham market main sabase bade pratispardhi khilaadi hai
 The entire grocery market in India is approximately 300 billion US dollars

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday warned that if Italy did not fulfill its assurance to send back its two marines (marines) killing Indian fishermen back to India, the consequences would suffer
 singh ne loksabhaa main prashnkaal ke baad sadasyon dwaara yah mudda uthaaye jane par kaha, ‘isamen do raay nahin ho sakati ki italy sarkaar ne jo kiya he, vah uchit nahin he
 Our government has already clarified that this behavior of Italy is not acceptable
 usne supreme court ko diye gayi aashwaasan kaa ulanghan kiya he
 He said that the way the assurances given by Italy to the Supreme Court in the context of sending these marines back to India have been violated is not in the interest of bilateral relations
 singh ne kaha, ‘hamane italy sarkaar se kah diya he ki vah supreme court main diye gayi halafname kaa sammaan karte hue donon marinon ko waapas bheje
 If not sent back, it will suffer the consequences
 ’gauratlab he ki italy ke in do marinon ne bhartiya samudri kshetra main bharat ke do machuaaron kii kathith rup se goli markar hatya kii thi jiske baad inhen giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 Earlier, the court had given permission to these two marines to visit their country to celebrate Christmas and New Year
 italy kii ore se halafalnamaa diya gaya tha ki donon marine bharat laut aaenge or ve laut bhi aaye the
 But during the election in Italy, he was allowed to go back to his country for voting
 italy ke rajdoot ne supreme court main halafanama diya tha ki donon marine chunavi prakriya ke baad waapas bharat laut aaenge lekin ab is aashwaasan kaa ulanghan karte hue italy ne elaan kiya he ki donon marine bharat nahin bheje jaaenge
 In zero hours, senior BJP leader Jaswant Singh took up the matter saying that these two Italian marines shot and killed two fishermen of the country not in the international maritime area but in the Indian maritime region and near our coast and later said That he had killed these fishermen as a sea bandit
 unhone kaha ki bhartiya tat par samudri dasyu kii koi samasya nahin he or na hi jis pot par ye italvi marine savaar the, us par unke desh kaa dhvaj laga tha isliye ve is tarah kii karrwai karne ke hakdaar bhi nahin the
 Singh described it as a surprise that these accused of murder were allowed to go to Italy in the name of participating in voting first in Christmas and New Year and later in Italy
 unhone sarkaar se sawaal kiya ki kya bhartiya jelon main band kaidiyon ko holi, diwaali yaa id ke samaaroh manaane ke liye jail se choda jaataa he yaa unhen chunaav ke samay matdaan main bhaag lene ke liye jane diya jaataa he? agar aisa nahin he to italvi marinon ke saath aisa vishesh vyavhaar kyon kiya gaya? singh ne kaha ki sheersh adaalat ne italy ke rajdoot ke aashwaasan par in marine ko unke desh jane diya lekin usamen praavdhaan tha ki italy main rahete hue bhi ve vahaan kii police kii hiraasat main rahenge
 He said that such special treatment of foreigners has already happened in the country
 bhopal gas cond ke mukhya aaropee warren anderson ko bhi desh se jane diya gaya
 In Purulia, the accused in the case of weapons were also sent to their country without completing the sentence
 yahi nahin italy ke vyapaaree ottavio kwatrochi ko bhi dilli se bhaagane main sibiai ne madad kii
 Singh said that the government should not tolerate the Italian government's handling of the assurance given to the Supreme Court about the marines
 unhone pradhanmantri se ye bataane kii maang kii ki italy ke is aacharan se utpann is maamle ko unki sarkaar durust kaise karegi
 Also said that the Constitution of India cannot be violated in the name of the Treaty of Vienna
 makapa ke basudev acharya ne sawaal kiya ki jab italy main dak se matdaan kii vyavastha he to bharat sarkaar ne donon marine ko matdaan karne ke naam par kyon jane diya? unhone kaha ki bharat sthit italy ke rajdoot ke aashwaasan par supreme court ne in marine ko matdaan ke liye jane kii ijaajat di thi lekin chunki bharat lautne ke aashwaasan ko italy ne ab tod diya he to bharat sarkaar rajdoot ke khilaaf kya karrwai karne ja rahi he?acharya ne bhi purulia hathiyaar cond or kwatrochi kaa naam uthaate hue kaha ki bharat ek samprabhu desh he or use videshi aparaadhiyon ke maamalon main unki sarkaron ke aage is tarah nahin jhukna chahie jisase desh ke atmasamman ko aghat pahunche
 Earlier in the Question Hour also, the Prime Minister said that the House and the country are agitated by the behavior of Italian officials in this matter
 unhone kaha ki vah is vishay par sadasyon kii chintaa ko saajha karte hai
 He said that he is ready for any kind of discussion in this matter
 colors par prasaarit rielity tivi sho 'big bos' main salmaan khan kaa andaaj darshakon ko khub bha rahaa he
 Sometimes they joke, sometimes they are seen pulling the leg of a contestant
 or haal hi main salmaan ke nishane par aae ranbir kapur
 In 'bigg Boss 7' Salman made fun of Ranbir's recent release 'besharam'
 ek tabloid kii khabar ke mutabik yah tab hua jab salmaan sho main aae mehmaan sharaman joshi or javed jaafaree se baatcheet kar rahe the
 Both the actors came to promote their new film 'war Chhok Na Yaar'
 is dauraan javed ne salmaan ko bataaya ki unki film ko samikshakon ne acchhee reating nahin di he
 At this, Sharman reminded Salman that the critics had given only 3 stars to 3 Idiots, but the film was the biggest blockbuster of that year
 donon kii baaten sunne ke baad salmaan ne kaha ki unki filmon ko kabhi samikshakon kii saraahna nahin milti
 He said, 'my films don't even get that much
 'iske baad salmaan ne mazaakia andaaj main 'besaram' par nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that initially critics gave Ranbir's film 'besharam' only one and a half stars, but later one star was removed from it
 unhone kaha, 'abhi besaram relies hui, usko bhi 1
 Got 5 stars and later when the box office collection came out, the critics also removed one star
 'haalanki salmaan, javed or sharaman ke bich hui is baatcheet ko channel par prasaarit nahin kiya gaya
 However, we would say that it seems that Salman is more influenced by the public areas of 'bigg Boss' house

 BJP and Congress are constantly attacking each other
 isi kadi main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi (rahul Gandhi) ne piem modi (PM Modi) par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi targeted PM Modi (PM Modi), saying that the school-going children also understood MNREGA, but the Prime Minister of the country (PM Modi) did not understand it till date
 unhone kaha (rahul Gandhi) , 'ham jab bhi sarkaar chalaate hai garibon ke liye sonch samaj kar kaam karte hai
 Modi ji gave a speech in Lok Sabha and made fun of these schemes
 modi ji ne kaha, dekhiye, manaregaa 'shame' kii baat he
 MNREGA is the most useless scheme
 isse kisi ko phayda nahin
 Congress has cheated people
 unhone rajasthan ke jaipur menkaha ki piem manaregaa hi nahin samaj paae
 The child going to school understood, but the Prime Minister of the country did not understand MNREGA
 rahul gandhi ne piem par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki modi ji ko samaj isliye nahin aayaa, kyonki manaregaa sirf gaddhe khodne kaa kaam nahin tha
 This scheme gave employment to crores of people
 gaanv main is yojana ke tahat alag-alag chijen baniin
 Roads were built, ponds were formed
 ise banane ke liye jab logon ne kaam kiya tab logon ke paas paisa aayaa
 When the money came, people started buying things
 chijen kharidi to logon ne chijen zyada bananaa shuru kii or rojgaar paidaa hua
 The PM did not understand that unless you put money in the pocket of the poor, the factories of India will not start
 rahul gandhi ne kaha, 'hamanen garibon kii jeb main paisa diya
 The economy of India will not be able to run till you see soap, sampu, new shirt in the homes of the poor
 yah baat skool jane vaala baccha samaj jaataa he, lekin piem ko samaj nahin aati
 The PM has demonetized the MGNREGA even further
 isse hua yah ki aapke paas jo bhi paisa bachaa tha vah piem ne aapse lekar bank main daal diya
 He said, 'it is different that after taking money from you and gave it to Nirav Modi
 notebandi kii vajah se garibon ke paas se paise le liye
 Because of this, the purchasing power of the people was lost
 abhi log notebandi se ubhare bhi nahin the ki piem ne 'gabbar singh tex' (GST) laga diya
 This further devastated small industrialists
 aaj chota dukandaar vyapaar nahin kar rahaa he, sirf jiesti ritern bhar rahaa he
 So that the taxman does not come and ask for money from us
 pradhanmantri par hamalaa bolte hue rahul ne kaha ki aaj piem kii vajah se na rojgaar paidaa ho rahaa he, unki vajah se na garibon ke paas paisa he
 The highest unemployment in 45 years is today
 unhone kaha ki aaj kisi bhi yuva ke paas koi rojgaar nahin he
 The PM has destroyed the entire system
 is vyakti ko hindustan samaj nahin aa rahaa he
 PM Modi said, i will forgive the debt of farmers
 
 
 karj maaf kar duungaa
 Will give employment to two crore youth
 bas piem bana dena
 PM bana do 'i'll become the watchman then see
 kya kisaan ke ghar ke aage chaukeedaar rahata he
 Does the unemployed look forward to the young man's house
 pehle kehete the ki mujhe chaukeedaar banaao kaladhan laagunga
 Now we all say that we are watchmen
 ab chaukeedaar ne chori kii or kehete hai sab chor
 How did the 'chowkidar chor' become 'achhe din aayenge se' within five years? piem ne apana koi bhi vaada puraa nahin kiya
