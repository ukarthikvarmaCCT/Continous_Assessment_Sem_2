 You should at least pay the Indian Police Service to be Indian
 aap har jagah sarkaron ke ishaaron par kaam kar rahe hai
 Sometimes see the gesture of your conscience
 tabadalaa or padonnati ke badale itani badi qeemat mat chukaayiye
 We do not know the names of the governors of some states
 kuch aayogon ke sadasyon kaa naam nahin jaanate hai
 Do not be silent for these posts
 seva main rahete hue ladiye
 Say it in samjhauton ke kilaaf boliye
 For the credibility of your department, say what happened in Mathura, why it happened
 baat kijiye ki aapke bich log kis kis aadhaar par bant gaye hai
 Write a diary that if someone among you was fighting honestly, then you were all silent
 aapane akelaa chhod diya
 This is the story of everyone, be it Indian Administrative Service or Police Service
 tippaniyan Otherwise, one day when you are walking in a park with a ruler and somewhere Mukul Dwivedi collides, how will you face them? Dude, we allowed you to walk the same way after your death
 kya ye jawaab denge? kya yaar hamane isi din ke liye police banane kaa sapana dekha tha ki ham sab apane apane jugad main lag jaayenge
 i will be killed and you will die while living
 kahin mukul ne ye kah diya to ! Ravish Kumar, who wants the benefit of all of you but does not want to become Governor or MP in its place, is the author of this paper
 daakiya gangaajal laane gaya he isliye main ise apane blog kasbaa par post kar rahaa hoon 
 Amen ! main is vakt aap logon ke bich apvadswarup afasaron kii baat nahin kar rahaa hum
 i am talking about that department which has been falling in every state full of years
 jo khandhar ho chukaa he
 In the ruins, i am speaking of beautiful young men dressed in uniforms and law, and old officers wearing uniforms, whose roses are spread on the pages of the newspapers as soon as they are posted in the district
 jinke ipies banane par ham log unke gaanv gharon tak camera lekar jate hai
 Perhaps the dream of doing something for the common people is left, which would have made your success a success of the people
 isliye ham har saal aapke aadarshon ko ricard karte hai
 Every year you also see those ideals beating you
 kya aap bhartiya police seva naam ke khandhar ko dekh paa rahe hai? kya aapaki vardi kabhi khandhar kii deevaaron se chipki safed papadiyon se takaraati he? rang jaati he? aapke bich behatar,nishpaksh or tatpar police banane ke khwaab mar gaye hai
 Therefore, you do not see the color of the walls of the depressed offices of SSP
 mujhe aapke khwaabon ko maarane vaale kaa naam pataa he magar main marane or maare jane waalon se poochna chahta hoon
 i have seen many of your colleagues from Delhi, after becoming commissioners in all the states, falling from the Governor to the mps and the desire to become members of Commissions
 mujhe koi pahaada na padhaaye ki raajnneetik vyavasthaayen aapako ye inaam aapke hunar or anubhav ke badale detii hai
 You all have become according to this system which is not according to anyone
 aap sabane har jagah samarpan kiya he or ab haalat ye ho gai ki aap apane gam kaa bhi izhaar nahin kar sakate
 It is summer, so it will not be known whether the uniform is wet with sweat or tears of friend's sorrow
 mujhe katarvy nishtha or parayanata kaa paath mat padhaaiye
 By making the peda of this loyalty, two or four officers among you are eating and the rest are looking for a chance to eat
 maamuli ghatnaon se lekar aatankwaad ke naam par jhuthe aaropon main phasaaye gaye naujavaanon ke kisse bataate hai ki bhartiya police seva ke khandhar ab dhahne lage hai
 From the riots to the rebellion, either you remained silent, made the inquiry incomplete and trapped anyone
 aapane dekha hoga ki gujarat main kitne ai pi es jail gaye
 One came out of jail and was dancing
 wo drishy bataa rahaa tha ki bhartiya police seva kaa iqbaal dhwast ho chukaa he
 Put that picture frame of the Indian Police Service and put it in the officers' mess of your states
 patan main bhi anand hota he
 You will sometimes enjoy seeing that picture
 ribero sahab ke bare main padhaa tha tab se unheen ke bare main or unka hi likhaa pard rahaa hoon
 The rest of the writers came but they started writing in your name and started charging for it
 police sudhaar ke naam par kuch logon ne dukaan chalaa rakhi he
 Awaiting when a position will be found
 main naam luun kya ? ek rajya main bich chunaavon main aapke bich ke logon kii jatigat or dharmik nishthaaon kii kahani sun kar sann rah gaya tha
 Should i tell? Don't you know See now, some retirees have started setting up raising questions of police reform on the pretext of Mukul's death
 khud jaise naukari main the to bahut sudhaar kar gaye 
 i understand your limitations yah bhi jaanata hoon ki aapke bich kuch shandaar log hai
 Idealism is still left among some
 bas ye patr unheen jaison ke liye likh rahaa hoon or un jaison ke liye bhi jo pard kar routine ho jaayenge
 Build a new building with these remaining ideals and stuff and then become a public department, whose identity is enough that no one can question being professional and unbiased
 apni khoi hui zamin ko hasil kijiye
 If you are afraid to speak alone, then speak with one hand
 iske liye jaruri he ki aap pehle mathura ke ziladhikari or es es pi se yaari dosti main hi puch lijiye ki aakhir vahaan ye naubat kyon ai
 On whose orders, we let such crazy people be two to two thousand
 ve hathiyaar jamaa karte rahe or ham kyon chup rahe
 Was Mukul killed due to any dangerous plans and system? Can any of us be killed tomorrow? Why was Mukul killed? Look for some answers on their lips and find some in their eyes
 kya ye maut aap sabaki naakaami kaa parinaam he? mathura ke ziladhikari, es es pi jab bhi mili, jahaan bhi mili, aafisar mess se lekar hazaratganj ke icecream parlor tak, puuchhiye
 Keep asking yourself too
 pataa kijiye ki is ghatana ke taar kahan tak jate hai
 Take a look at how many such possible incidents are scattered here and there
 raajnneetik qabzon se pareshaan kisi garib kii zamin waapas dilaaiye
 Go to the house of Santosh Yadav and Mukul Dwivedi
 unke pariwaron kaa saamana kijiye or kahiye ki darasal sahab se lekar ardli tak ham ateet, vartmaan or bhavi sarkaron ke samjhauton par pardaa daalane ke khel main itane abhyast ho gaye hai ki ham sabhi ko mara hua maan liya janaa chahie
 We all should get compensation while we live
 nahin kehane kii laachaari se nikliye sahab log
 Do not trust the retirees
 bolne kii jagah banaaiye
 Your job is not like ours, it was done in two minutes
 hamamen se kai phir bhi bahut kuch sabake liye bol dete hai
 You do an FIR against us at the behest of the governments, yet we speak
 rana ayyub kii gujarat files mangaai kii nahin
 You should at least pay the Indian Police Service to be Indian
 aap har jagah sarkaron ke ishaaron par kaam kar rahe hai
 Sometimes see the gesture of your conscience
 tabadalaa or padonnati ke badale itani badi qeemat mat chukaayiye

 You have all surrendered everywhere and now the condition is that you cannot even express your sorrow
 garmi he isliye pataa bhi nahin chalata hoga ki vardi paseene se bhigi yaa dost ke gam ke ansu se
 Do not teach me lessons of duty and devotion
 is nishtha kaa peda banaakar aapke bich ke do chaar afasar kha rahe hai or baaki log khaane ke maukey kii talash kar rahe hai
 From minor incidents to the false accusations of terrorism in the name of terrorism, the stories of the youth reveal that the ruins of the Indian Police Service are now collapsing
 dangon se lekar balvon main yaa to aap chup rahe, jaanch adhuri kii or kisi ko bhi fasaa diya
 You must have seen how many ips went to jail in Gujarat
 ek to jail se baahar aakar nrity kar rahaa tha
 The scene was telling that the Iqbal of the Indian Police Service has collapsed
 bhartiya police seva kii wo tasviir frem karakar apane apane rajyon ke aficers mess main laga dijiye
 There is also joy in the fall
 us tasviir ko dekh aapako kabhi kabhi anand bhi aayega
 i had read about Ribeiro Saheb and since then i have been reading about him and his writings
 baaki bhi likhane vaale aae lekin wo aapke naam par likhte likhte uski qeemat vasuulne lage
 Some people have run a shop in the name of police reform
 is intazaar main ki kab koi pad milegaa
 Shall i take the name? In the middle elections in a state, i was stunned to hear the story of caste and religious allegiance of the people among you
 bataaun kya? kya aapako pataa nahin? abhi hi dekhiye kuch ritair log mukul kii maut ke bahaane police sudhaar kaa sawaal uthaate uthaate setting main lag gaye hai
 As if he was in a job himself, he improved a lot
 aapaki simaayen samajhataa hoon
 i also know that you have some wonderful people among you
 kuch ke bich adarshavaad ab bhi bachaa he
 i am just writing these letters for those types and also for those who will become routine after reading
 in bache khuche adarsh or saamaan se ek nai imaarat bana lijiye or phir se ek lok vibhaag baniye jisaki pahchaan bas itani ho ki koi peshewar or nishapksh hone par sawaal na uthaa sake
 Regain your lost land
 akele bolne main dar lagata he to ek duusare kaa haath pakad kar boliye
 For this it is necessary that you first ask the District Magistrate of Mathura and the SSP in friendship with you, why did they come there
 kiske kehane par ham aise sanakee logon ko do se do hazaar hone diye
 They kept collecting weapons and why we kept quiet
 kya mukul vyavastha or raajnneeti ke kisi khataranaak mansoobon ke kaaran maaraa gaya? kya kal hamamen se bhi koi maaraa ja saktaa he? mukul kyon maaraa gaya? kuch jawaab unke honton par dekhiye or kuch unki aankhon main dhundhiye
 Is this death the result of your failure? Ask the District Magistrate of Mathura, SSP, whenever you meet, from Officer Mess to Hazratganj ice cream parlor
 khud se bhi poochhate rahiye
 Find out how far the strings of this event go
 nazar daudaiye ki aisi kitni sambhavit ghatnaon ke taar yahan vahaan bikhare hai
 Get back the land of a poor person who is troubled by political occupation
 santosh yadav or mukul dvivedi ke ghar jaaiye
 Face their families and say that we have become so accustomed to playing a veil on the agreements of past, present and future governments, from the Honor to the orderly, that we should all be considered dead
 ham sabko jite ji muawza mil janaa chahie
 Get out of the helplessness of saying no, sir
 ritair log ke bharose mat rahiye
 Make a place for speaking
 aapaki naukari hamaari tarah nahin he ki do minute main chalata kar diye gaye
 Many of us still speak a lot for everyone
 aap sarkaron ke ishaaron par hamaare kilaaf epa ai aar karte hai phir bhi ham bol dete hai
 Gujarat files of Rana Job not of Mangai
 aap kam se kam bhartiya police seva ke bhartiya hone kaa farj to adaa karen
 You are acting at the behest of governments everywhere
 kabhi kabhi apane zamir kaa ishaara bhi dekh lijiye
 Do not pay such a big price in exchange for transfer and promotion
 ham sahi main kuch rajyon ke rajyapalon kaa naam nahin jaanate hai
 The names of the members of some commissions are not known
 in padon ke liye chup mat rahiye
 Fight while in service
 boliye
 Speak against these agreements
 apane mahakme kii saakh ke liye boliye ki mathura main kya hua, kyon hua
 Talk about on what basis people are divided among you
 diary hi likhiye ki aapke bich kaa koi eemaandaaree se lard rahaa tha to aap sab chup the 
 You left it alone bhartiya prashasnic seva ho yaa police seva sabaki yahi kahani he
 The comments varanaa ek din kisi park main jab aap ruler lekar walk kar rahe honge or kahin mukul dvivedi takaraa gaye to aap unka saamana kaise karenge ? yaar hamane tumhaari maut ke baad bhi jaisaa chal rahaa tha vaisaa hi chalane diya
 Will they answer Did we dream of becoming a policeman for this day, that we will all get involved in our jugaad? main maaraa jaaounga or tum jite jite ji mar jaaoge
 Somewhere Mukul said this! aap sabhi kii kairiyat chaahane vaala magar iske badale rajyapal yaa saansad banane kii chaah na rakhane vaala raveesh kumaar is patr kaa lekhak hai

 On behalf of the petitioner, Prashant Bhushan told the Supreme Court that the parliamentary party had said that towers should be removed from places where the population is more, but the Center did nothing

 aavedan karne kii aakhri taarikh-12 march 2018 The arrest of Vindu Dara Singh, who came under the aegis of spot-fixing in the IPL, has raised many questions
 phixing kaa beshak bollywood se yah pehla conection he, magar iske baad khel or cinemajagat ke kuch or logon ke naam saamne aaen to hairaani nahin honi chahie
 Here we are giving you a series of information about this
 yaad kiijie 6 april kaa eme chidambaram stadium, chennai main khelaa gaya match
 The match was between Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians
 ipel kaa yah paanchvaan match tha
 Mumbai Indians won the toss and bowled first and scored 148 runs in twenty overs, which is not considered a big score for T20
 vahiin, chennai ke liye ye gharelu maidan tha or team ke form ko dekhakar sabko yahi laga ki chennai super kings aasaani se match jeet jaaegi
 Meanwhile, the television screen on the ground during the match saw Sakshi, the wife of team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, at the VIP stand of Chennai Super Kings
 sakshi kaa stadium main yun dikhnaa chaunkaata nahin, kyonki ve ipel ke lagbhag har match main team ke saath stadium main najar aa rahi thim
 But, the face that was seen with Sakshi definitely surprised
 vah cheharaa vindu daara singh kaa tha 
 Vindu Dara Singh was watching the match exactly equal to Sakshi and Mahendra Singh Dhoni's manager was present there along with him
 screen par teenon ko ek saath us samay dikhaaya gaya, jab dhoni batting kar rahe the
 Dhoni had a great batting in this match
 19wein over ke khatme par dhoni 25 gendon main paanch chauke or teen chhakkon ke saath 50 ran bana kar khel rahe the
 He had a strike in the 20th and final over
 aakhri over main chennai super kings ko jeet ke liye 12 ran chahie the, jabaki uske paas do wicket bache the
 Looking at Dhoni's form, it seemed that 12 runs would be made easily
 aakhri over main munaf patel gendbaaji karne aae
 On the first ball of Munaf, he caught Pollard and was dismissed
 iske baad is over main sirf teen ran bane or chennai super kings 9 ranon se match haar gai
 Vindu Dara Singh's presence in the VIP enclosure of the stadium in the nearest match now raises doubts and questions
 shaq ye ki kya is match ko fiks yaa match main spot phixing ke liye vindu stadium main the? kya vindu kaa stadium main hona khilaadiyon yaa buki ko koi ishaara tha?or sawaal ye ki vindu daara singh aakhir viipi incloser main baithkar match dekhne kiske kehane par pahunche? kya use dhoni, sakshi yaa chennai super kings management ne bulaayaa tha? agar haa to unase vindu ke kya rishte hai?agar mumbai krime branch kaa daawa sach he ki vindu buki or khilaadiyon ke bich kii kadi tha, to jaahir he stadium main uski maujuudagi is match par sawaal khadey karti he
 However, according to reports, Dhoni's close friends have said that Vindu was not called by Sakshi or Dhoni to watch the match and neither of them have any friendship with Vindu

 On the other hand, Ness Wadia said that he was shocked by such allegations
 unhone priti ke aaropon ko bebuniyaad qaraar diya he
 Preity Zinta wrote about this case on Facebook: 'I am not very rich or powerful, but i have worked hard to gain self-respect in my life so far
 main is baat se kaaphi dukhi hum ki pehle jab saarvajanik jagahon par mujhe apamaanit kiya gaya, to kisi ne meraa saath nahin diya

 During the IPL match at the Wankhede Stadium, Ness Wadia molested and abused him

 The police have registered a case of molestation of eve teasing, that is, under the sections of IPC related to the case
 priti jinta ke kareebi dost or ek samay unke bvoy friend rahe ness wadiya is maamle main aaropee hai
 Initially, the Marine Drive police tried to hide the name of the accused, but later it became clear that Preity Zinta had filed a complaint against Ness Wadia for molestation, indecent behavior, abusive and threatening
 priti kii shikaayat ke mutabik, maamla 30 may, 2014 kaa he
 On May 30, the match was going on between the Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings at the Wankhede Stadium at the Wankhede Stadium

 Ness Wadia's denial of the allegations, after Wadia's complaint of Preity Zinta, has described these allegations as baseless
 ness ne wadiya group ke mukhya jansampark adhikari naveen soni ke jariye in aaropon ko niraadhaar bataaya he
 The Wadia Group's mail said, "I have been shocked by Preity's complaint
 mujh par lagaae gaye sabhi aarope bebuniyaad hai

 Team India entered the tournament with an intention to feed Lokesh Rahul to the fourth position, but after Dhawan was injured, Rahul had to open in the entire tournament and the fourth place crisis was sustained
 dhawan kii chot ne badhaai thi kohli kii museebataustralia ke khilaaf match main shikhar dhawan ko ballebaaji ke dauraan anguuthe main chot lagi thi
 Dhawan's injury had increased captain Kohli's troubles
 shandaar form main rahe shikhar dhawan ko chot lagane ke baad world cap se baahar kar diya gaya
 Rishabh Pant was included in Team India replacing Shikhar Dhawan
 shikhar dhawan ke ghayal hone kaa asar opening ballebaaji ke saath-saath number 4 par dikhaa
 Lokesh Rahul, who played at number 4 due to Dhawan's injury, had to open in the remaining matches
 rahul ke opening karne se chauthaa sthaan khaali ho gaya
 In such a situation, captain Kohli gave the opportunity to batsmen like Vijay Shankar, Rishabh Pant and Hardik Pandya at this place

 If seen, Dhawan's injury cost Team India expensive and the team could not overcome it in the entire tournament

 He said, 'lord Rama is married on this earth and Lord Krishna also got married here
 lekin, is aadmi (kohli) ne italy main jaakar shaadi rachaai he
 By which he cannot become a patriot
 'vidhayak ne kaha, 'vah hamen kaise prerana de sakate hai, kyonki ham sabhi un logon se prerana lete hai, jo desh ke prati vafaadaar hote hai
 The same applies for his bride (anushka Sharma)
 bijepi vidhayak ne yah bhi kaha, ki 'italy kii dancer bhi bharat main karodpati-arbapati ban jaati he, vahiin kohli bharat kaa paisa desh se baahar le gaye hai

 On Thursday, a day before the conclusion of the Earth Summit, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh clearly stated the aspirations of developing countries that the burden of environmental damage done by rich countries in the past cannot be equally burdened on developing countries
 sammelan main ubharate or garib deshon kii harith praudyogikiyon or kaaryakramon ko dhan uplabdh karaane ke viksit deshon ke prastaavon ke taur-tareekon par kisi arthpurna samaadhaan ke abhaav va aspashtataa ko lekar khed vyakt kiya gaya
 The absence of two main leaders of the rich countries - US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel - was also evident
 donon netaaon ne is mahatvapurn shikhar sammelan ke liye yahaan jamaa hue koi 90 netaaon ke saath hissaa nahin liya
 Yet three key points have emerged from the summit for emerging economies in general and for India in particular, which in many ways ensures that they will not be burdened with paying more for green, stable growth
 pehali baat yah ki chunki dhani desh prithvi ko pradooshit karke viksit hue hai, lihaaja ubharate vishwa ko bhavishya main harith vikaas or aajeevika ke mudde par puri laagat vahan karne ke liye majaboor nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Secondly, this summit has started the process of stable development goals
 yah prakriya, pratham prithvi shikhar sammelan main paryaavarniya chintaaon se nipatane main rashtriya sthitiyon, praathamiktaaon or kshamtaaon kaa sammaan kiye jane ke siddhant ko sweekruti die jane ke kii thik 20 varsh baad shuru hui he
 The third point is not to impose specific goals on all components and leave this process to intergovernmental opinion, which will give developing and developed countries equal rights to find just and acceptable solutions
 manmohan singh ne kaha ki vaishvik str par is samasya ke prati hamaara drushtikon is boj ke nyyochit bantwaare par aadhaarit hona chahie
 Because the first Rio summit enshrined the principle of parity, but the responsibilities varied
 pradhanmantri mexico ke los cabose main ji-20 shikhar sammelan main hissaa lekar buudhvaar ko yahaan pahunche the, or vah shuukravaar subah pretoria ke raste nai dilli ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye
 He is scheduled to reach New Delhi late Saturday evening

 Only two weeks have passed
 pehle hafte main sabhi ko tankhwaah milani thi isi kaaran bheed badi
 Some people want to keep the money in the bank itself

 People have inconvenience, we can agree but the solution will be found soon

 kisi aarthik visheshgy ke bayaan ke bare main unheen se poocha janaa chahie
 We can only keep the government's side and the government's decision is a big step towards ending corruption and black money and for macroeconomic reforms
 notebandi ke mudde par sheetakaaleen satr main koi kaamkaaj nahin hone ke bare main puche jane par santosh kumaar gangavar ne kaha ki sadan main kaamkaaj sucharu rup se chale yah sarkaar or vipaksh donon kii jimmedaari he, sarkaar kii thodi zyada he
 And so we were willing to discuss demonetisation from day one
 lekin kuch vipakshi dalon khaskar congress ne betuki sharte rakh deen
 He said that it is unfortunate that the opposition kept making noise in the House instead of discussing it
 ateet main bhi aise kai avasar aae hai ki sadan nahin chalaa
 But today the opposition has nothing to say, so it disrupted the House
 prashnkaal or shoonyakaal vipaksh kaa sabase kargar hathiyaar hota he lekin vipakshi dalon ne is samay bhi hangaamaa kiya
 The comments sadan main kaamkaaj nahin hone par bhaajapa ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ke aakrosh or pidaa vyakt karne ke bare main puche jane par gangavar ne kaha ki unki takalif swaabhaavik he kyonki sabhi chaahate hai ki sadan main sucharu rup se kaamkaaj ho

 But some opposition parties, especially the Congress, set absurd conditions

 Big B's displeasure can be gauged from the fact that he has expressed his anger more than a congratulatory message in the blog he wrote after the team's victory
 puraa blog padhane ke baad yah saaf ho jaataa he ki amitabh kii naaraazgi bhartiya camentator harsha bhogale se he or isaki vajah he ki unke comentary kaa andaaj
 Amitabh Bachchan wrote in his blog, 'I am very happy with India's victory but also very angry with Indian commentators (english) on TV
 saurav ganguli ko chhodkar koi bhi camentator bhartiya team kii hausala afjai nahin kar rahaa he
 It looks like they are supporting England

 When there was one ball left to end the match and England needed 6 runs to win on this ball, an Indian commentator says that now England need just one six to win

 Have you lacked the words to praise the Indian team for performing so well? 'big bi ne likhaa, 'angrej ballebaaj bharat kii shandaar gendbaaji ke kaaran out ho rahe hai or bhartiya camentator vipakshi ballebaajon par sawaal uthaa rahe hai

 bijepi se baghawat karne ke baad party se nikaale ja chuke jaswant singh laalkrishna adwani se milane pahunche hai

 bataaya jaataa he ki subah kareeb 11 baje purv bijepi netaa jaswant singh ne laalkrishna adwani se mulaakaat kii
 After the bjp's landslide victory in the Lok Sabha elections, many meanings are being extracted from this meeting of Jaswant Singh
 gauratlab he ki bijepi kii loksabhaa chunaav main jaswant singh ne apni pasandida seat barmer se hi chunaav ladane ko lekar party se baghawat karadithi
 He contested an independent election, in which he lost
 samajha ja rahaa he ki jaswant ab apane bete ko bijepi main phir se shaamil karaane ke liye adwani kaa daaman tham rahe hai
 However, Jaswant has been a senior BJP leader and is an old ally of Advani

 Actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui is one of the few Bollywood actors whose acting is considered by all
 lekin ye baat bhi sach he ki bollywood ek glamer industry he or yahaan par rangabhed jaisi chizon bhi maujuud hai
 Recently, while speaking on this issue, Nawaz has said very good and stinging
 navaj ne apane twitor acount par ek twit karte hue likhaa ki mujhe yah ehsaas dilaane ke liye shukriya ki main kisi gore or handsam ke saath kaam nahin kar saktaa, kyonki main kaala hum or main dikhne main bhi acha nahin
 But i never paid special attention to those things
 Thank u 4 making me realise dat i cannot b paired along wid d fair & handsome bcz i m dark & not good looking, but i never focus on that
 - Nawazuddin Siddiqui (@nawazuddin_s) July 17, 2017 Nawazuddin's tweet is a harsh slap in the face of all those who have refused to give him work, despite his looks and color
 bataa den ki haal hi main navazuddin ne ek intervyuu ke dauraan bataaya tha ki ek samay aisa tha jab unke liye televijan kii duniya main bhi apane liye role paanaa kitna mushkil tha
 Nazar Nawazuddin, who will be seen in the lead role in the psychothriller film Phobia 2, said that due to being an outsider many times people used to say that i do not look like an actor, because neither my six-pack abs nor i am tall and handsome
 yahaan tak ki log mere rang-rup ke aadhaar par mujhe jaj karte
 From where Mamlanwajuddin has made this tweet on the statement of 'babumoshay Gunsbaaz' casting director Sanjay Chauhan, in which he said that he cannot cast white and beautiful heroines as his opposite
 sanjay ne apni ek statement main kaha tha ki film kii script ke saath hi navazuddin kaa naam tay ho gaya tha
 His opposite Chitrangada Singh was first taken, but after he left, the film's search for heroin was renewed
 navazuddin ko dhyaan main rakhte hue hi saare kalakaar chune gaye kyonki unke apojit saaf rang kii actress nahin lee ja sakati thi
 The casting director gave such a clarification, however, the casting director of 'babumoshi gunbaaz' Sanjay Chauhan later gave his clarification
 aaj tak se baat karte hue unhone kaha ki unki baat ko tod marod kar pesh kiya he or navaj jaise senior actor ke liye vah aisi baat kah bhi nahin sakate
 Nawaz said that this is true of the society, while Nawazuddin Siddiqui told his opinion to Aaj Tak
 unka kahana tha ki ek vyakti ne apane paksh kii baat rakhi to maine uskaa jawaab diya
 Then this apartheid is true of our society
 ghar main bhi sabhi chaahate hai bahu ekadam gori aae
 So i have no displeasure with this
 khayr in sab baton kaa navaj ke tallent par koi asar nahin padaa or aaj apni mehnat ke dam par wo jahaan pahunche hai vahaan tak bahut kam log hi pahunch pate hai
 The media today seems mired in a strange paradox: the more freedom people have to express their opinions, the greater is the pressure to tell only the most noisy and most aggressive story
 or jab lakhon log haath main thame upkaran (jise ham kabhi phone kaha karte the) ke jariye vaishvik prasarankarta ban gaye hai, aise main un sanghathanon ko sanbhaalanaa bhi mushkil hota ja rahaa he jo khabaron ko jutaney or unki 'pushti' karne ke liye panrparik rup se patibaddh hai
 There are two aspects of danger facing today's media
 pehla yah vichaar ki 'sachai' or 'tathy' kaa koi astitv nahin he
 Wise journalists and scholars have always believed that knowing the 'whole truth' or 'all the facts' is a goal that is out of reach
 lekin us lakshya ko hasil karne kii disha main agar kathor prayaas kiye jaaen to eemaandaaree se kii gai jaanch hamen lakshya ke kaaphi kareeb le ja sakati he
 But today the raging crowd, which is receiving information through wild tweets, is encouraged by Donald Trump such as to abuse the reporters present at the 'enemies of the public' event
 bharat main hindutv ke thekedaar prakashkon or lekhakon ko aisi raay vyakt karne se daraate hai jo unke vichaaron se mail nahin khaati hai
 The tweets have now become 'facts'
 aaj digital soochna kii bhayaavah takat bheed ko sangathit hone or logon kaa maarane kaa hathiyaar muhaiyaa karaati he
 The second danger facing today's media world is related to the earlier threat
 yah he, un sanghathanon ko jivit rakhane kii kathinaayee, jinhen ham 'samachar sanghathan' kehete hai—ve santhaan jo apane logon ko sahi report karne ke liye paryaapt paisa dene or kathin samay main reportron kaa sahyog karne main samarth hon
 In olden times, the salaries of journalists were paid mainly from the earnings of advertisements
 akhbaar inhen vigyapanon par nirbhar the
 Today, advertisements have gone digital and printed newspapers are succumbing to the lack of money or are shrinking
 cellphone connactivity kii simaaon, smartphone ke dhime prasar or bharat main likhane ke 11 alag-alag systamon kii jatilta ke kaaran bhartiya print prakaashan ab tak iske dushprabhav se kuch had tak bache hue hai
 Another reason to avoid this is that most of India's publications are family-owned private companies
 america main paariwarik swaamitv vaale akhabaaron ko dhire-dhire korporate shairdharakon ne share kii badhati keemton or labhaansh ke laalach main aakar kharid liya tha
 Like elsewhere, there is one thing in India - the inclusion of small organizations in one group
 kuch kshetreey bhashaaon ke akhbaar do bade akhabaaron main villin ho gaye hai
 Kerala, which has always topped the number of newspapers read and read, saw 10 daily newspapers on the streets every morning
 aaj vahaan malayalam main keval malayala manorama or mathrubhumi kaa hi dabadabaa rah gaya he
 At the national level, all other newspapers have become dwarfed in front of the English-language newspaper Times of India
 is digital duniya main 'samachar' kaa kya bhavishya he? duniya ke saath hi bharat main bhi keval kuch bade samachar sanghathan hi bache rah paaenge
 But what will happen to the local news? The major breakthrough in Indian language newspapers came in the 1980s when newspapers such as 'eenadu' in Telugu began to extract additional appendices at the district level
 iske baad toote hue pulon or baandhon main daraar kii khabaren chhapane lagi thim
 Earlier these news were limited to the districts but later they started reaching the state capitals and thus the news became a shame for legislators and concerned officials
 ek baar march, 1993 main chennai jane vaali ek dhimi train main andhra pradesh ke ek pulicekarmi se meri mulaakaat ho gai
 i said that i am writing a book on newspapers in Indian languages
 vah gambhir ho gaya
 He said that these newspapers have made the life of our policemen very difficult

 Payal Rohatgi, a bygone actress, keeps making headlines on social media with her sensational statements
 unhone apane haalia twit main mahaan samaaj sudhaarak raja ram mohan raay ko angrejon kaa chamachaa bataaya he
 He shared a tweet in which Raja Rammohan Roy was a social reformer and founded the Brahmo Samaj Movement
 unhone desh se sati pratha or bal vivaah ko khatm karne ke liye andolan bhi chalaaya tha
 Many historians have also called him the father of the new age in India
 is twit ko share karte hue paayal ne likhaa nahin ve angrezon ke chamache the
 The British used Rajaram Mohan Roy to discredit the practice of sati
 sati parampara desh main anivaary nahin thi balki mughal shaskaon dwaara hindu mahilaon ko veshyavriti se bachaane ke liye is pratha ko laayaa gaya tha
 Sati was practiced by the will of women
 sati kisi bhi maamle main anaadhunikikrut pratha nahin thi
 No he was a chamcha to Britishers who used him to defame the Sati tradition
 Sati tradition was not compulsory but was introduced to prevent the prostitution of Hindu wives by the hands of Mughal invaders
 It was the woman's choice

 unhone kaha ki mumbai police ko is maamle main turant kaarywai kerani chahie
 Dear @ mumbaipolice- this is a clear cognizable offense under Clause 5 of the Commission of Sati (prevention) Act, 1987
 Clause 5 details out “punishment for glorification of sati
 “hoping that urgent action is taken in this very serious and shocking matter

 rahul gandhi is varsh may main congress ke sheersh pad par apni maa kaa sthaan le sakate hai jinke bare main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne kaha he ki vah apane avkaash se jald hi lautenge
 Discussions are on about the possibility of convening an AICC meeting with the Congress Working Committee for this purpose in Delhi or party-ruled Himachal Pradesh or Uttarakhand in May and senior Congress leaders say party vice president Rahul Gandhi's holiday After returning from, the issue of the post of Congress President will be intensified
 rahul kii lambi anupasthiti par chal rahi charchaa ke bich congress ne 26 march ko party ke sanghathanaatmak chunaav kaa kaarykram pesh kiya tha jiske tahat agle party pramukh kaa chunaav 30 sitambar tak hone kaa kaarykram he

 kuch netaaon kaa kahana he ki agar unhen party adhyaksh banane kaa faisla kiya jaataa he tab usee prakriya ko doharaaya ja saktaa he or sanghathanaatmak chunaav ke aade nahin aayenge
 There was speculation that Rahul could be nominated as the Congress President at any time, but his retirement immediately before the budget session led to questions on future plans
 sonia gandhi ne ab tak sabase adhik samay tak congress kaa adhyaksh banane kaa record banaaya he or unhone is pad par 17 varsh puure kiye hai
 On Saturday, Sonia Gandhi, who visited Rahul Gandhi's parliamentary constituency Amethi, told the media that the Congress vice-president will soon call
 ullekhneey he ki sonia gandhi ne congress adhyaksh kaa pad 1998 main grahan kiya tha or seetaram kesari kaa sthaan liya tha

 The Congress may even ignore Yadav's pinch that Rahul Gandhi started the election campaign by turning the sleeves, then tearing the Samajwadi Party's manifesto and move ahead in the campaign and it is possible that this political drama will come down from his platform You are in the jump
 lekin ek baat kii to chintaa use kerani hi hogi, ki is naatak ko dekhne vaale ab hans rahe hai
 One laugh is enough to air the biggest charismatic claim
 yah sanyog nahin ki chadhaai aasteenon kaa jo kuch bhi asar tha, vah dhire-dhire gaayab hota dikh rahaa he
 It takes a long time to catch a political trend, but a 45-year long time is enough to bypass the exceptions to that trend
 45 saal pehle 1967 main congress ne hindustan kaa zyaadaatar hissaa kshetreey partiyon ke haathon ganvaana shuru kar diya tha
 Its culmination was seen in the decades of 1967, 1977 and 1990 when it started crawling on its knees in Delhi and from Amritsar to Calcutta it was no longer worth mentioning
 isaki kismat kaa sitara bulandi par 1971-72 main pahunchaa jab indira gandhi ne party main vichaardhaara kaa mantra foonka
 The same situation happened in 1984-85 when his martyrdom turned into an election victory for the Congress
 lekin 1952 se 1967 ke bich ke 15 saal tak congress satta ko lekar jis tarah aashwast rahi, vah daur phir kabhi nahin aayaa
 Mrs
 Gandhi's legacy still flashes somewhere in the closed corners of the mind that still determines the behavior of voters
 ve ek majboot centre or uske adheen kamjor rajya sarkaron main vishwaas karti thim
 The regional parties retaliated in this way and they were supported by the federal character of our Constitution
 is desh kaa matadaata, jo taarkik taur par majboot centre or saath hi majboot rajya sarkaar bhi chahta he, usne dilli ke liye to congress main bharosa jataayaa lekin rajyon ke liye duusari partiyon main
 Even the success of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's NDA alliance has not completely erased the memories of the destruction of the Janata Party between 1977 and 1980
 matadaata shaayad hi kabhi galat hota he or congress har baar rajyon main use sahi tehra detii he
 UPA 2 may be crumbling, but if there are any governments lying in a deeper pit than that, they are the Congress governments of Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Goa
 rajyon main congress kii itani kharaab haalat he ki kshetreey partiyon ke bich dhadebaaji or gutbaji tak kaa dohan karne main vah naakaam rahi he
 It will be called a major offense no less than a penalty stroke
 isaki bajaae is kism ke kshetreey vibhaajanon ne congress kii vaapasi ko yaa to roka he yaa phir uski sambhaavna hi khatm kar daali he

 gajipur landphil site ko lekar NGT ne ahm aadesh diya he
 The NGT has ordered the East MCD not to throw garbage at the Kagajipur landfill site without segregation, ie, it would not be possible to put all the litter at the same place as before
 iskaa matlab emsidi ko sookhe or geele kooday ko alag-alag jagah daalana hoga or usamen bhi sab category hogi
 In addition, the NGT directed that the East MCD will also segregate the waste already lying at the Ghazipur landfill site
 uske baad enechaeirashtriya rajmarg banane ke liye us kooday kaa istemalkaregi
 This waste will be used for the national highway to be built from Nizamuddin to Meerut
 is tarah kooday kaa istemaal kareeb do kilometre ke ilaake kii sadak ko banane ke liye kiya jayega
 The central government will provide an additional Rs 50 crore to help the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) in this work
 ye ek tareeke kaa incentive kaha ja saktaa he, kyonki isse jahaan ek ore dilli me kooday ke pahaado ko kam kiya ja sakegaa, to duusari taraf iskaa istemaal sadak nirmaan main karke nirmaan kii laagat ko bhi kam kiya ja sakegaa
 During the hearing on Friday, the NHAI, while presenting its side, told the NGT that they have started taking the garbage from Ghazipur to road construction
 engiti ne is maamle main east emsidi or enechaeai ko compliance report dene ko kaha he
 Now the next hearing of the case will be on October 5, in which both will have to tell how much and how they complied with the orders of the NGT during the two weeks

 After the change in prices, Echo Dot can be purchased for Rs
 4,099 instead of Rs
 4,499
 yani isamen 400 rupee kii chhot di ja rahi he
 As a reminder, even when the Google Home Mini was launched in India, the price of this speaker was reduced to Rs 1,000 under the limited period offer
 haalanki ye ofer graahakon ko ek hi order main doshaichho dotkarixane par diya ja rahaa tha
 Similarly, if you talk about the price of Amazon Echo, then it has been cut by Rs 1,000
 yani ab graahak ise 9,999 rupee kii jagah 8,999 rupee main kharid sakate hai
 Also, if customers still buy two units in the same order, then they will be given an additional discount of Rs 1,000
 yahi ofer april main bhi graahakon ko diya gaya tha
 Comparing both Echo and Echo Dot, the Dot is a left speaker and not enough for a large room

 Keeping different things in the plate has different importance but the most important is the praise sung with Aarti

 What are the rules for performing Aarti? - Aarti cannot be performed only without worship, chanting, prayer or bhajan - It is always best to perform Aarti only at the end of any worship or prayer - Lamp of camphor or ghee in the Aarti plate , Both can light the flame - if doing aarti with lamp then it should be Panchmukhi - along with it, keep the flowers of worship and kunkum also - rotate the plate of aarti in such a way that Aarti should be made - Aarti should be rotated four times at the feet of God, twice in the navel, once on the face and seven times on the entire body - After the Aarti, flowers should be placed in the plate and put tilak of Kunkum in what kind of Aarti

 lekin ab satta ke galiyaaron se khabar he ki modi sarkaar ke chintakon ne sarkaar kii chhavi ko saaf karne kii ek nai yojana banaai he
 It will be told through an advertisement that what is the thinking of the government in the matter of religion
 yah sochbataayenge amitabh bachchan
 The purpose of this scheme is to instill confidence in the government by taking the fear of conversion from the minds of minorities

 Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi is one of the few Muslim faces of the BJP

 They will meet the local people and tell them what the Central Government thinks about this
 vikaas ko aadhaar banaakar aage badhane vaale pradhanmantri modi ne khamoshi ke saath is yojana ko hari jhandi de di he
 The most important thing is that there is a plan to make an advertisement for this work
 jisamen logon se vikaas ke liye dharm or jati se upar uthne kii guzarish kii jaayegi
 This advertisement is considered to be a brainchild of Narendra Modi
 is vigyaapan ke liye khud modi ne mahanayake amitabh bachchan ko prastaav bheja he
 Significantly, Amitabh has also worked in the promotional advertisements of the Gujarat government earlier on Modi's request
 ye vigyaapan deshbhar main pasand kiye gaye the
 The government's exercise has its place but the question is whether such a campaign or advertisement will make any difference? Whereas organizations like RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal and Hindu Mahasabha are constantly talking of organizing 'ghar Wapsi' programs
 dharmantaran or 'ghar vaapasi' ke bich modi sarkaar alpsankhyakon ke bich bharosa kaayam kaise kar sakati he? ek taraf to sarkaar apni chhavi ko durust karne kii kavayad kar rahi he or duusari taraf bhagava brigade kaa dharmantaran kaarykram bina kisi rokatoke ke jari he
 In such a situation, it is natural to question the intention of the government

 V-108, School of Vocational Studies and Applied Sciences, Gautam Buddha University, Greater noidajyaxa jaankaree ke lieyaha clic karen Problems faced by passengers during air travel and complaints against the airline company are nothing new
 lekin shanivaar ko singapore se jaipur ja rahijet airwayske yatriyon ke saath kuch aisa hua jisaki koi kalpana bhi nahin kar saktaa
 It is said that vegetarian passengers were served non-vegetarian food on a Jet Airways flight from Singapore to Jaipur
 yatriyon kaa aarope he ki airways dwaara die gaye khaane ke packet par shaakaahaari khaanaa to likhaa tha, lekin packet ke andar kii kahani kuch or thi
 Some travelers started eating it as vegetarian food, only then some passengers found pieces of chicken in the food, after which many passengers started vomiting
 is ghatana ke baad vimaan main savaar yatri hangaamaa karne lage
 Angry passengers refused to get off the plane on reaching Jaipur and demanded immediate action
 maamle ko gambhir hota dekh airline adhikariyon ne siaisef ke surakshakarmiyon ko bulaayaa phir kisi tarah jaanch karne kaa aashwaasan dekar yatriyon ke gusse ko shant kiya
 It is worth noting that even before this, many such complaints have been received against the airline companies
 kai baar yaa to yatriyon ko kharaab khaanaa paros diya jaataa he yaa phir khaane main chhipakali or cockroach jaisi chijen bhi mil jaati hai
 But the question is that despite the thousands of rupees spent by the passengers, why is the government not able to curb such attitude of the airlines
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ko chunaavon ke liye master ranneetikaar aise hi nahin mana jaataa
 Shah has also started putting the bjp's master plan on the ground for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 khaas ranneeti ke tahat shah ne isi maheene se alag-alag pradeshon kii 5-5 loksabhaa siton ke liye apane daure shuru kiye hai
 In the first week of April, Shah covered 5 Lok Sabha seats in a two-day tour of Orissa

 He will also address a conference of party workers, after which Amit Shah will visit Rajasthan in the second week of May

 If sources are to be believed, the BJP leadership is aware that due to anti-incumbency factor in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in UP, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Delhi and Maharashtra, the party's seats may be reduced
 amit shahne pichley saal se hi pashchim bengal, urisa, kerala, telugana, tamilnadu or north east kii un 120 siton par party kii taaqat jhonk di he, jahaan bijepi kabhi bhi jeet nahin pai he
 Now Andhra Pradesh has also added 22 seats
 yani aisi kul siten 142 ho gai hai
 bjp's focus now has 233 (90 + 142) seats in addition to 283 seats won in 2014
 90 wo siten jin par bijepi 2014 main duusare sthaan par raheen or 142 wo siten jin par bijepi kabhi nahin jiti
 The BJP feels that there are some seats in which the party has won in the last four years

 In the four gang rape-accused encounters in Hyderabad, he said, "not found according to law, all the accused of gang-rape with a female doctor in Insaafirabad have been killed in the police encounter
" shivasena ne apane mukhpatr saamana main shanivaar ko telugana police kii tarif karte hue likhaa ki police jindabad, peedita ko nyaay mila he
 The public is showering flowers on the police shouting slogans of Zindabad
 shivasena ne kaha, parade ke peeche kii kahani aisi he ki police jaanch ke liye aropiyon ko ghatnasthal par le gai, unhone bhaagane kii koshish kii to police ne un par goliyaan chalaakar encounter kar diya
 Shiv Sena said in the face that no one will believe this story but the four Naradams have ended, so people have expressed happiness
 police ne 7 dinon main diya aropiyon ko mrityudandbata den ki disha ke saath 27 november ko gangrape hua auradarindon ne peedita ko jaan se maar diya
 Not only this, the body was burnt with petrol
 is ghatana ke baad se hi deshbhar main gussa he
 However, after the police encounter on Friday, when the Hyderabad gangrape accused were killed, the fire of anger got somewhat cold
 shivasena ne kaha ki police ne sirf 7 dinon main gangrape ke aropiyon ko mrityudand de diya
 Bypassing all these on investigation, charge sheet, case hearing, court date, Hyderabad Police took a shortcut way to give justice
 muthbhed par shivasena ko nahin vishwasashivsena ne kaha ki is maamle ko lekar ab do gut ban gaye hai
 On one hand, people say that the police did not take the legal route to deliver 'justice'
 haalanki police ne jo gaiyrkanoonee rasta apanaaya, vahi janabhaavana he
 Shiv Sena said, leave the dispute whether the encounter happened or not
 ham khud bhi is muthbhed par vishwaas karne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 But if the Hyderabad police terminate the four accused forever, they should be welcomed
 kanoon ke aadhaar par aropiyon ko jald mili sajashivsena ne kaha ki mahilaon ke saath atyaachaar ke maamalon main kanoon kii lambii prakriya se aparaadhiyon ko bal mil rahaa he

 rape ke aropiyon ko faansee ho yah kanoon ban gaya he, lekin yah balaatkaari abhi tak jivit kaise hai? shivasena ne kaha ki hyderabad police ne jo kiya vah kanoon ke aadhaar par nahin he
 Doing so will end the rule of law

Kumbh Mela Quiz 24: team india te coach ravi shastri england main isi saal hone vaale cricket vishwa cap ke dauraan captain viraat kohli ko chauthe number par utaarne kii soch rahe hai
 Shastri believes there will be favorable conditions for bowlers, so he wants to save Kohli for the subsequent overs
 coach shastri ne kaha ki chauthe number par ballebaaji karte hue kohli madhyakram or nichalekram kii ballebaaji ko majboot karenge
 Shastri told 'cricbuzz', 'the good thing about India's top three batsmen is that we can separate them depending on the situation and the situation
 viraat kohli jaisaa ballebaaji chauthe number par utar saktaa he or ballebaaji kram main adhik santulan ke liye ham tisare number par kisi or ballebaaj ko utaar sakate hai
 However, after the statement of Ravi Shastri, the question has started to arise among cricket lovers and analysts in the country whether this decision will be right? Virat Kohli has been in tremendous form in recent overseas tours
 kai baar vah team kii ore se maidan par tikne vaale ballebaajon main akele rahe
 If the opening batsmen pile up cheaply, then the pressure on Virat Kohli or later batsmen may increase
 aise main yah sawaal kiya ja rahaa he ki unhen jarurat upree kram main utaarna sahi rahegaa yaa nahin
 To this, Shastri said, 'this is flexibility and you have to be flexible for a big tournament like World Cup so that you can see what is the best option for the team
 ' shastri ne kaha, 'england main halaat dekhne ke baad ham iskaa akalan karenge
 You do not want to fall three for 18 or four for 16 in a big tournament
 main dwipaksheeya vanade siries kii chintaa nahin karata lekin vishwa cap match main main apane sarvshereshth ballebaaj ko jaldi kyon ganvaa duun
 'let us tell you that Ambati Rayudu showed his ability by playing a match-winning innings of 90 runs in the Hamilton ODI match on the tour of New Zealand recently and Shastri said that he can be the option in the third place
 yani unhen viraat kohli se upar ballebaaji ke liye bheja ja saktaa he
 The coach of Team India said, 'yes, maybe Rayudu, or someone else can bat at number three and Kohli can come at number four

 The most successful captain of the England cricket team, Michael Vaughan, has expressed hope that the current captain Alastair Cook may resign after the crushing defeat in the Test series against India
 bharat ne england ko paanch test maichon kii siries main 4-0 se karaari maat di
 After losing the series, Cook also said that he would go home and think about his future
 maaikel waanne kaha, ‘pichley teen maichon se unke haav-bhav se aisa laga he ki maano vah captaini se istipha dene ke bare main soch rahe hon
 However, Vaughan has certainly not said anything about Cook's resignation and said it would be better for Cook to take full time to consider the decision
 won ne kaha, ‘vah is faisle ke liye samay len, iske vah hakdaar hai
 We will have to wait
 vah maansik taur par behad majboot hai
 Under his captaincy, he has passed this round two or three times, but he did not give up
 ’unhone kaha, ‘lekin unhen apane aap se eemaandaar hona padegaa
 They have to think if they have the energy left to take the team ahead in the upcoming seven Tests and the Ashes series? If the answer is even 1% in 'no', then they should step down
 ’‘cook ke saath he puri english team’team ke bure pradarshan ke baad cook istipha dene ke bare main soch rahe hai aisi khabaron ke bich team ke assistant coach paul farbras ne kaha he ki cook ko team kaa samarthan hasil he or is tarah kii koi baat dressing room main nahin he
 He said that Cook has the full support of the team
 paul ne kaha he ki is tarah kii baton kaa uthanaa laazmi he, lekin dressing room main is tarah kii koi baat nahin he
 The team management is planning to play the Ashes series next year under the captaincy of Cook
 paul ne kaha, ‘ham jaanate hai ki unhen team kaa samarthan hasil he
 He is the team's favorite player and captain
 ’paul ne kaha, ‘agar vah istipha dena chaahate hai to yah shame kii baat hogi kyonki ham unhen captain ke rup main dekhnaa chaahate hai
 We have chalked out a strategy for this and are also making Cook the captain of the team in the Ashes next winter
 vyaktigat taur par main chahta hum ki vah captain bane rahen
 He said, 'he is the captain
 har koi jaanata he ki vah cook ke saath kahaan khadaa he
 There is no atmosphere of uncertainty about this in the team

 Cook would like to take some time before taking any decision on captaincy

 Amidst all this, England team management director and former captain Andrew Strauss will hold talks with Cook in January

 is dauraan donon main prem pranceg ho gaya or avaidh sambandhon tak inke sambandh kaayam ho gaye
 After this, both of them formed the idea of getting married
 in donon ke bich kareeb 3 saal se prem prasang chal rahaa tha
 When Banwari got a sense of their relationship, there was a fight between Banwari Lal and his wife several times over the relationship
 aarope he ki banavaari ne apni patni ke saath marpet bhi kii
 Such a murder plan was made, after this, wife Santosh made a plan to meet the lover Hanuman and kill the husband
 pehle charan main yah tay hua ki pati ko maar dete hai
 But Banwari's wife said what would happen to these children, after which both of them planned to kill the children together and started preparing
 is ghatana ko anjaam dene ke liye kareeb teen maheene kaa samay laga
 Hanuman Prasad came at around 10 pm on the day of the incident, when Banwari's wife was standing on the roof of her house
 usne ankhon se ishaara kar diya or wo vahaan se chalaa gaya
 After that, along with two hired killers Kapil and Deepak went to the house in Shivaji Park and showed them the house

 At around one o'clock in the night, he killed Banwari Lal (40) and his eldest son Aman (17) Hapi (14) Nikki (12) and Ajju (9) with a sharp attack
 police adheekshak ne bataaya ki nikki banavaari ke chote bhai mukesh kaa putr tha or banavaari or mukesh kiraaye ke makaan main rahete hai
 After this, the wife of the deceased was handed the key of Scooty to the 3 accused
 teenon badmaashon ne is ghatana ko dastaane pahanakar anjaam diya
 Santosh came under suspicion while pretending to be sick in the hospital
 kilors ko die 3 hajaar rupabataya ja rahaa he ki killer deepak or kapil ko 3 hajaar rupee die gaye the
 The master mind wife of the murder herself went to sleep with her sister in a room on the roof of the house
 skuti se teenon aaropee savaar hokar railway stesan ke sameep pahunche or mandi mode par skuti khadi kar railway stesan pahunche
 But due to lack of train, he reached Rajgarh via auto

 Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Senior Advocate, Supreme Courtpinky Anand, Additional Solicitor General, Government of India 20: 00 - 20:45 pm: Mission 2019 Amit Shah, BJP President class room main sone kii master ji kii kaaphi puraani aadat thi
 In order to get rid of this habit of Master Ji, children came up with an idea, which got them in trouble
 ab vah safai dete phir rahe he
 This case is related to Saran district of Bihar
 vaise sarkari skulon main shikshakon ke letlatif pahunchane or skulon se jaldi gaayab hone ke saath hi class room main sone kii aadat koi nai nahin he
 At the same time in this era of social media, now children have started keeping an eye on their teachers
 ek skool main class room main hi ek shikshak ramkumar ke so jane kaa video soshal media par beete do dinon se khub viral ho rahaa he
 The video has been made by students from mobile and uploaded by students on social media
 NSUI: goa main 10veen kii itihaas pustak main ab nehru kii jagah saavarkarklas main shikshak ke soe hone kaa video soshal media par aplod or viral hone ke baad logon ke bich tarah- tarah kii charchaa ho rahi he
 Ramkumar of Middle School, Tamanpura, who is sleeping snoring in the class room of the school, is told
 is sambandh main bataaya jaataa he ki viral video main dikh rahe shikshak mahoday bacchon kii upasthiti banane ke baad class room main hi gahari neend main so gaye
 What is the anti-trafficking bill, why are sex workers scared of it? After that, a child made a video of Guruji sleeping with his mobile
 video banaate vakt kuch bacchon ne guruuji ke aasapaas sharaarat bhi kii he, phir bhi master sahab gahari neend se nahi jag paaen he
 When other teachers of the school came to know about this, the teachers also forced the students to delete the video, but the students refused to delete the video
 is sambandh main skool ke anya shikshakon ne so rahe shikshak ko sugar kii bimaari se grast bataaya he, beemaari se grast hone kii vajah se unhen zyada neend aati he
 Also, the school teacher said that such an incident is shameful for the teacher class
 vahiin chaatro kaa aarope he ki skool main padhai bhi thik se nahi hoti he, ye shikshak hameshaa class main so jate he,koi baat poochne par baad main bataane kii baat kah kar taal dete hai
 India has always denied that it is engaged in a tightly-fought battle in Baluchistan, the troubled western state of Pakistan
 par pakistan kaa maananaa he ki aazaadee kii saalagirah par pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bayaan ne bharat kii maasoomiyat ke daawey ko taar-taar kar diya he
 Modi has accused Pakistan of repression in Balochistan and promised to raise the issue on international forums
 kalpana kiijie: ek bhartiya pradhanmantri pakistan ke thik usee ilaake main maanav adhikaron ke hanan kaa mudda uthaa rahaa he jiske bare main vah iljaam laga rahaa he ki vahaan bharat dakhal kar rahaa he
 It was seen as an interference in diplomatic insincerity and internal affairs of Pakistan
 aise main civil or sainya rahanumaon kii ore se is par tikhi pratikriya aani hi thi
 Most people believe that Modi's move has been taken very thoughtfully so as to divert attention from the growing international concern about the merciless use of power by his government in the Kashmir-controlled parts of India
 paak ke sabase sammanit udaaravaadi akhbaar don ne apane ek sampadakeey main likhaa, ''shri modi ko us bhayanak raste par achche se vichaar karnaa chahie tha jis par kadam rakhane kaa dussahas unhone kiya he
 When India raises the question of Balochistan, Pakistan can turn around and respond to instability in north-eastern India and violence at the hands of the state
 yah beakl iljaamon or pratyarope kaa rasta he
 India and Pakistan certainly deserve better
 ''dilachasp yah he ki bharat haal tak baluchistan main gadabadi ko hawa dene ke iljaamon par baat tak karne se manaa karata rahaa tha, vahiin pakistan ne dotarafa baithkon main aksar isko uthaaya tha
 When former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh accepted the request of his Pakistani counterpart to include this issue in the talks, the opposition called him very bad
 so, tajjub nahin ki modi ke bayaan ne pakistani afasaron ko hairat main daal diya
 Despite the success of security forces in overcoming rebellious violence and political instability in Balochistan, Pakistan's accusations have intensified over the years
 is saal ke shuru main pakistan ne baluchistan main ek bhartiya jasoos kii giraftaar kaa daawa kiya tha
 Kulbhushan Jadhav, a suspected RAW agent, was involved in alleged subversive activities in the state and some other parts
 modi kaa bayaan queta main bheeshan aatmghaatee hamale ke kuch hi dinon baad aayaa
 More than 75 people were killed in this attack
 yah shahar main sabase barbar hamalon main se ek tha, jisane vakeelon kii ek puri pusht kaa safaya kar diya
 The jamaat-ul-ahrar (JUA), an anonymous-militant faction, took responsibility for this
 mana jaataa he ki is dhade ke zyaadaatar dehshatgardon ne phata main faujee karrwai ke baad bhagkar sarhad paar purvi afghanistan main panaah le rakhi he
 Within hours of the attack, security officers and members of Nawaz Sharif's party were pointing fingers at India for the attack
 unka iljaam yah tha ki china pakistan aarthik galiyare (sipiisi) ko patari se utaarne kii koshishen kii ja rahi hai
 Quetta has been bathed several times in the last 10 years and thousands of people have died
 pehle ke zyaadaatar hamalon kaa nishaanaa haajra shiya birdari hua karti thi
 Incidents of separatist violence in the city have come down following stern action against some militant factions, but in recent months there has been a sharp increase in targeted killings and IED attacks on security forces
 inamen se zyaadaatar vaardaaton ke liye baluchi algaavvaadi dhadon ko jimmedaar tehraaya gaya he
 In Balochistan, the labyrinth of terror makes the presence of a variety of militant factions there more complicated, ranging from the reclusive to the separatists
 al kaayda or ies ke nishaan bhi yahaan dekhe gaye hai
 These terrorist networks spread all over the world have found natural partners among the Sunni extremist factions here
 sach yah he ki yah ies main bhartee kaa akhaada ban gaya he
 Whatever the Indian Prime Minister meant, rebel Baloch leader Brahmadag Bugti thanked Modi for supporting Balochistan
 brahamdag bugti abhi switzraland main rah rahe hai
 Till recently, Brahmadag (who himself became a Muslim in 2006 after the death of his grandfather and one of the most powerful tribal leaders and former governor Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti) in a military operation, the Pakistani ruling with the intention of ending the slaughter in the province Was ready to talk to
 algaavvaadi netaa ne jis tareeke se fatafat modi kaa shukriya adaa kiya, pakistani afasaraan use mil-julkar uthaae gaye kadam ke saboot ke taur par dekhte hai
 The separatists also have reason to take such desperate steps
 haal hi main baluchi rashtravaadi dhadon ke siyaasi prakriya main laut aane kii vajah se unhone apana bahut-sa janaadhar ganvaa diya he
 Until recently, the National Party was led by the government of the state, which is the most powerful nationalist faction in the province and is headed by former Chief Minister Abdul Malik
 yah party soobe or centre donon jagahon par gathbandhan sarkaron kaa hissaa he
 Now that the nationalist government has been vigorously elected to seek a political solution to the crisis in Balochistan, it is not a happy situation for the 'negatives'
 algaavvaadiyon ne 2013 ke chunaavon main khalal daalane kii koshish kii, kyonki ve maanate the ki chunaav se unke makasad ko nuksaan pahonchega
 They failed to prevent people from casting their votes
 aise main hamalon main haal kii badhotaree ke peeche makasad saaf taur par sarkaar kii baatcheet kii peshkash ko tahas-nahas karnaa he
 Such terrorist actions can create difficulties for nationalists and strengthen the forces that are advocating to brutally crush the rebels
 islamic ugravadiyon or balooch algaavvaadiyon ke bich koi taalluk najar nahin aata
 But both of these sections want to derail the process of jhumriyat and embarrass the subaltern rule led by the nationalists
 yah sach he ki baluchi logon ko islamabad se sachhee shikaayatein hai, magar zyaadaatar netaa maanate hai ki bharat kii dakhsandaji se maamle main keval pechidgiyaan hi paidaa hongi
 Balochistan became part of Pakistan some 70 years ago
 tab se balooch rashtravaadiyon ne chaar bagawaton kii aguai kii he—1948, 1958-59, 1962-63 or 1973-77 main
 But the government strictly crushed them all
 2006 main akbar bugti kii hatya ke baad baghawat kaa ek or daur shuru hua
 As before, the leadership of this separatist movement is mainly in the hands of the tribal leaders, but it is also supported by educated middle class youth
 1988 main general jiyaul haq kii 10 saal lambii faujee hukumat kaa khaatmaa or jackuahuri prakriya kaa phir se shuru hona baluchi rashtravaadiyon ko siyaasi mukhyadhara main le aayaa
 His important demands related to gas royalty and allocation of federal resources were not met, but Jamhooriyat had at least made him realize political involvement
 magar 1999 main faujee hukumat kii vaapasi ne us aman-chaiyn ko khatm kar diya
 Tension grew with the government's military crackdown against Akbar Bugti
 is karrwai ko soobe par sangheey niyantran ko or sakht karne ke kadam ke taur par dekha gaya
 The overwhelming majority of Baloch nationalists rejected the demand to secede from the country and struggled for autonomy within the framework of the Pakistani Union
 par hukumat ke daman ne is bantwaare ko dhundhala kar diya or narampanthiyon ko garampanthiyon ke saath jane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 a large number of cadres of nationalist parties joined the armed struggle
 baluchistan jaise-jaise araajaktaa main dhansata gaya, rajya kii satta khatm hoti gai
 The infamous 'kill and throw' policy witnessed the murder and disappearance of many political activists and pushed more and more people, especially the youth, into the arms of separatists
 faujee karrwai ko pichley kuch saalon se roak diya gaya he or baghawat par kaabo paa liya gaya he, magar ab bhi bahut lambaafasla tay karnaa he taaki soobe main siyaasi halaat sthir ho sake or sarkaar kii hukumat puri tarah kaayam ho sake
 It is now a war between the moderates returning to the path of Jamhooriyat and the militants who refuse to give up armed fighting
 tamaam alahada dhadon ke bich badhate matbhed aksar khoonkhaar ladaaiyon main phute hai, magar inhone algaavvaadi andolan ko or kamjor bhi kiya he
 While non-baloch settlers have long been the target of attacks by armed factions, hundreds of political activists have been killed in factional fighting
 takaraav ne siyaasi khandaanon ko bhi baant diya he
 Former Chief Minister and head of Balochistan National Party Akhtar Mengal has returned to the country and is a member of the assembly of the state, while his younger brother Javed Mangal has attached his fortune to the rebels
 isi tarah baluchistan libration front (blef) ke netaa harobayar mari ke bhai changez mari pakistan muslim lig ke tikat par chune gaye or soobe kii sarkaar ke member hai
 Whatever Modi's intention, his statement on Balochistan has united the political forces of the state against the rebels
 yah ehsaas zyada tari ho rahaa he ki islamabad main baluchistan ke logon ke yakeen ko behaal karne kaa akelaa rasta jamhuri prakriya hi he
 Balochistan is not Kashmir

 Qurratul Ain Haider is one of the strong and popular storytellers of Urdu language
 manto, krishnachandar, bedi or chugtai ke baad ubharanevaali nasl main unka mahatvapurn sthaan he
 The stories of Qurratul al Haider bring forth new styles, new environments and new worlds in contrast to the prevalent progressive stories

 inaki kahaniyon main prem or ghrinaa, khushiyaan or sundarataa or kurupata ek saath maujuud hai
 Read the literature on Aajtak on the death anniversary of Qurratul ain Haider today
 His famous story Photographer: Photographer- Kurratul en haidermausme-bahar's exquisitely glazed guesthouse surrounded by the fruits of the green mounds
 tile ke ain neeche pahari jhil he
 a forceful road reaches the gate of the guesthouse along the shore of the lake
 phatak ke nazadik walrus kii aisi moonchhonvala ek photographer apana saazo-saamaan failaae ek tin kii kursi par chupchaap baitha rahata he
 This anonymous hill town is not in the tourist area, due to this very few people come towards this place
 chunaanche jab koi maahe-asl maananevaala joda yaa koi musfir guestaouse main aa pahunchataa he to photographer badi ummid or sabar ke saath apana camera sambhaale baag kii sadak par tahalne lagata he
 He has an agreement with the gardener's gardener
 guestaouse main thahari kisi noujvaan khatun ke liye subh-savere guladasta le jate vaqt mali photographer ko ishaara kar detaa he or jab maahe-asl manaanevaala joda naashte ke baad neeche baag main aata he to mali or photographer donon unke intjaar main chaukas milte hai
 The photographer has been here for years
 na jane or kahin jaakar apni dukaan kyon nahin sajaataa
 But he is a resident of this town
 apni jhil or apni pahari chhodkar kahan jaae
 Sitting at the gate of this gate, he has seen the colorful spectacles of the changing world
 pehle yahan sahab log aate the
 Baratnavi planters, Jagadari officers of the Colonial Service wearing white sola hats, their memes and Baba people
 raat-raat-bhar sharaaben udayi jaati thim or gromophone chinate the or guestaouse ke nichle dryngrum ke chobi farsh par dance hota tha
 In the time of the second big battle, Americans started coming
 phir mulk ko azaadi mili or ikkaa-dukka sayyah aane shuru hue yaa sarkari afasar yaa nae byaahe shaamon ko jhil par jhuki dhanuk (dhanush) kaa nazaaraa karnaa chaahate hai, aise log jo sukun or muhabbat ke mutlashi hai jiskaa zindagi main vajood nahin, kyon ham jahaan jate hai fanaa hamaare saath he
 Fana is with us wherever we stay
 fanaa musalasal hamaari hamasafar he
 Passengers continue to move in and out of the guesthouse
 photographer ke camere kii aankh yah sab dekhati he or khamosh rahati he
 Every evening a young man and a girl came down to the guesthouse
 yah donon andaaz se maahe-asl manaanevaale maaloom nahin hote the lekin behad masaroor or sanjeeda-se vah apana saamaan uthaae upar chale gaye
 The top floor was completely empty
 jeene ke baraabar main dining haal tha or uske baad teen bade room
 - I'll take this room
 noujvaan ne pehle bedrum main daakhil hokar kaha jiskaa rukh jhil kii taraf tha
 The girl threw her umbrella and overcoat on a bed in that room
 - uthaao apana boria-bistar
 The young man told him
 - acha
 
 
 
 ladki donon chize uthaakar baraabar ke cinting-rum se guzarati duusare kamare main chali gai jiske peeche ek pukhta galiyara-sa tha
 Out of the large rooms in the room, there were workers who were busy repairing the back wall with a ladder
 ek baira ladki kaa saamaan lekar andar aayaa or darichon ke parade baraabar karke chalaa gaya
 The girl transformed into traveling clothes and entered the sitting-room
 noujvaan atshadan ke paas ek aramkursi par baitha kuch likh rahaa tha, usne nazaren uthaakar ladki ko dekha
 Burial outside the lake was dark
 vah dareeche main khadi hokar baag ke dhundhalake ko dekhne lagi
 Then she too sat in a chair, not knowing what both of them were talking about
 photographer jo ab bhi neeche phatak par baitha tha, uskaa camera aankh rakhata tha lekin samaat se aari tha
 After some time both of them went to the dining room and sat on the table next to it
 jhil ke duusare kinare par qasbe kii raushaniyaan jhilamila uthi thim
 By that time, a European Sayyah had also arrived at the guesthouse
 vah khamosh dining-haal ke duusare kone main chupchaap baitha khat likh rahaa tha
 a few picture postcards were placed on the table in front of him
 -- yah apane ghar khat likh rahaa he ki main is vaqt puyisraar mashrik ke ek puyisraar dakbangale main maujuud hoon
 a rumpled Hindustani girl is sitting in front of me in a rutted sari
 bada hi romentic maahaul he
 The girl said secretly
 uskaa saathi hans padaa
 After eating, both of them again entered the sitting-room
 noujvaan ab use kuch padhakar suna rahaa tha, raat thi, raat gahari hoti gai
 The buried girl sneezed loudly and she snorted and said --- now sleep
 -- tum apni zukaam kii dawa pinaa na bhoolanaa
 The young man said furiously
 -- haan, shababkair
 The girl replied and went to her room
 pichhlaa galiyara ghupp andheraa padaa tha, cameraa behad purasukun, khunak or aaraamdeh tha
 Life was very good and comfortable
 ladki ne kapade tabdeel karke singaar-mez kii daraaj khol dawa kii shishi nikaali ki darvaaze par dastak hui
 He opened his door wearing his black kimono
 noujvaan zaraa khayraya hua tha, saamne khadaa tha
 - i am also getting a very hard cough
 usne kaha
 -- good
 
 
 
 The girl gave him the medicine bottle and spoon
 chamachaa noujvaan ke haath se chhootakar farsh par gir gaya, usne jhukkar chamachaa uthaaya or apane kamare kii taraf chalaa gaya, ladki raushnee bujhaakar so gai
 She went to the dining room for breakfast
 zeene ke baraabar vaale haal main phool mahak rahe the
 After the copper bouquets were brightened with Braso, the recently shimmering chobies were placed in a queue on the floor and fresh flowers were placed near them
 baahar suraj ne jhil ko raushan kar diya tha or zard va safed titliyaan sabze par udati phir rahi thim
 After some time the young man was seen laughing at Zeena, holding a bunch of rose flowers in her hand
 -- mali neeche khadaa he, usne yah guladasta tumhaare liye bhijwaya he
 He entered the room and said smiling and placed the bouquet on the table
 ladki ne ek shagufa uthaakar bekayaali se use apane baalo main laga liya or akhbaar padhane main masroof ho gai
 - a photographer is also hovering below, he very kindly asked me to ask you whether you are such a movie-star? The young man said sitting on a chair and making tea
 ladki hans padi
 She was a nameless Rakkasa
 magar is jagah par kisi ne uskaa naam bhi na suna tha
 The young man was more famous than the girl
 magar use bhi yahan koi na pahchaan sakaa tha
 Both of them got a lot of good news about their resentment of oblivion and the plethora of great comfort
 kamare ke duusare kone main naashtaa karte hue akele european ne aankhe uthaakar in donon ko dekha or zaraa sa muskuraayaa
 He too had attended the silence of these two
 naashtaa ke baad donon neeche gaye or baag ke kinare gulmohar ke neeche khadey hokar jhil ko dekhne lage
 The photographer suddenly looked like a deception, took off the hat in a big drama style and bowed a little - "photograph, lady? The girl saw the watch
" -- ham logon ko abhi baahar janaa he
 will be late
 -- ladi
 
 
 The photographer placed his feet on the mound and stretched out an arm, pointing towards the outside world, and replied - Outside the carzzare-hayat has run agonizingly
 mujhe maaloom he is ghamaasan se nikalakar aap donon, khushi ke chand lamhe churaane kii koshish main masroof hai
 See, Dhanuk disappears on this lake moment-by-moment
 lekin main aapkaa zyaada vakt na luungaa
 Come here -- bada lasaan photographer he
 The girl secretly told her partner
 mali jo goyaa ab tak apane kyuu kaa muntazir tha, duusare darakht ke peeche se niklaa or lapakkar ek or gusadasta ladki ko pesh kiya
 The girl giggled and laughed
 vah or uskaa saathi amar sundari parvati ke mujassamen ke qareeb ja khadey hue
 It was sunny on the girl's eyes, so she gave smiling eyes a little
 clic-clic
 
 
 The picture landed
 -- tasaveer aapako shaam ko mil jaaegi
 Thank you, lady
 thank you,sar
 
 
 The photographer bent down and touched the hat again
 ladki or uskaa saathi car kii taraf chale gaye
 They both returned after taking a walk
 sandhya kii naarangi raushnee main der tak baahar ghaas par padi kursiyon par baithe rahe
 When the fog began to fall, the residents inside sat in the floor of the floor and orange kumkum in the silent drawing room
 na jane kya baaten kar rahe the jo kisi tarah khatm hone ko hi na aati thim
 They went up while eating
 subh-sabere ve waapas ja rahe the or apni baton kii mahviet main unako photographer or uski khanchi hui tasaveer yaad bhi na rahi thi
 The girl was in her room when Subhay came in and presented an envelope - Photographer, it was given at night
 usne kaha
 -- good
 us samnevaali daraaj main rakh do
 The girl told Beckhali and was busy making hair
 naashte ke baad saamaan baandhte hue use daraaj kholana yaad na rahaa or jate vaqt khaali kamare par ek sarsari nazar daalkar vah tej-tej chalati car main baith gai
 The young man started the car
 car phatak se baahar nikali
 The photographer lifted the hat off the culvert
 musafiron ne muskuraakar haath hilaae
 The car went down from Dhalwan
 vah walrus kii aisi moonchhonvala photographer ab bahut boodha ho chukaa he
 And in the same way, at the gate of that guesthouse is sitting a tin chair
 or sayyahon kii tasaveeren utaarata rahata he jo ab nai fazaai sarvice shuru hone kii vajah se badi taadaad main is taraf aane lage hai
 But at this time, a tourist coach who came from the airport and entered the gate, only one Khatoon was found carrying his briefcase case and he looked at the photographer, who stood up immediately after seeing the coach, but instead of a young and beautiful girl After seeing a middle-aged Bibi, she had gone back to despair and sat in her tin chair
 khatun ne daphtar main jaakar register main apana naam darj kiya or upar chali gayi
 The guesthouse was deserted
 sayyahon kii ek toli abhi-abhi aage ravaanaa hui thi or baire kamare kii jhaai-ponch kar chuke the
 And under the dining hall, the white burrack table under the door was twinkling with thorns
 nauvarid khatun darmyaani bedroom main se guzarakar pichley kamare main chali gayi
 And after keeping her belongings, she came out again and started looking at the lake
 chaay ke baad vah khaali sitting-room main ja baithi or raat hui to jaakar apane kamare main so gai
 When some shadows peeped inside the corridor, she got up and went to the stool where the workers had left the ladder on the wall after working all day
 galiyara bhi sunsaan padaa tha vah phir palang par aakar letin to chand minute baad daravaaje par dastak hui
 They opened the door, there was no one outside
 sitting-room bhany-bhany kar rahaa tha, vah phir aakar let raheen
 The room was very cold
 bah ko uthakar unhone apana saamaan baandhte hue singarmez kii daraaj kholi to uske andar bichhe pile kaagaz ke neeche se ek lifaafe kaa konaa nazar aayaa jis par unka naam likhaa tha
 Khatoon surprisingly pulled out the envelope
 ek cakroch kaagaz kii tah main se nikalakar khatun kii ungali par aa gaya
 He flicked his finger and fell down one of the envelopes, in which a young man and a girl, Amar Sundari, were smiling close to Parvati's Mujassam
 tasaveer kaa kaagaj pilaa pad chukaa tha
 Khatoon kept looking at the picture for a few moments, then kept it in his bag
 baire na baahar se awaz di ki airport jane vaali coach taiyaar he
 Khatoon went down
 photographer nae musafiron kii taak main baag kii sadak par tahal rahaa tha
 After going close to him, Khatoon said with disdain --- Amazing, how many times the Singar-table must have been cleaned in fifteen years, but this picture remained under the paper in the same way
 --phir unki awaz main jhallahat aa gai-- or yahan kaa intazaam kitna karaab ho gaya he
 Cockroach is the only cockroach in the room
 photographer ne chaunkkar unako dekha or pahchaanane kii koshish kii, phir khatun ke jhuriyon vaale chehre par nazar daalkar alam se duusari taraf dekhne laga, khatun kahati raheen-- unki awaz bhi badal chuki thi
 There was a fairness and hardness on the face and irritability and beggar in style and she was saying flatly --- i have retired from the stage
 ab meri tasaveeren koun khinchega bhala, main apane vatan waapas jate hue raat-kii-raat yahan thahar gai thi
 New air service has started
 yah jagah raste main padati he
 - and-and-your partner? -the photographer asked Ahista
 coach na horn bajaayaa
 - You said that there was a run of pride in karzare-hayat
 isi ghamaasan main kahin kho gaye
 The coach played the horn again
 -- or unako khoe hue bhi muddat guzar gai
 
 
 Good Hafiz yourself
 khatun ne baat khatm kii or tej-tej kadam rakhti coach kii taraf chali gayi
 Photographer with such a mustache of walrus sat near the gate and sat in his tin chair
 zindagi inasaanon ko kha gai
 Only cockroaches remain
 ***pustakaspratinidhi kahaniyalekhak:kurratul en haidaravidha:kahaniprakashakahrajakmal prakashanmoolyahrupye 75 / - paperbaque In Bias Omar, when Sonakshi Sinha stepped into the film world, Salman Khan, 44, became her hero
 do saal baad sonakshi abhi bhi 24 kii hi hai or is saal aa rahi unki chaar filmon main teen ke hero jindagi ke chalis se zyada vasant dekh chuke hai
 Four years ago when Deepika Padukone's first film Om Shanti Om came, she was 21 and her hero was exactly double that of Shahrukh Khan at 42 years of age
 to isamen ajeeb kya he? chalis paar hona koi aparaadh he bhala?nahin
 The question is not whether the heroes are forty crosses, the question is where are those forty crossed heroes with whom 40-45 year old superstars started their film careers by dancing around trees in the age of twenty The The heroes are still dancing around the trees with the heroines of the age of their daughter and granddaughter, and the heroines accompanying them are lost in the wilderness of time
 misses eks-vaai-jed banane main unke shandaar filmi kariyar kaa ant hua
 As a French writer once said, the most permanent career for a woman in this world is 'shaadi'
 hamaare samay kii sabase aadhunik, aatmanirbhar or dher sara paisa kamaane vaali striyon kaa sabase sthaayee kareer antat shaadi hi hua
 Why this? The question is disturbing
 isiilie to apane samay kii jaani-maani abhinetri dipti naval achaanak kuch der ke liye chup ho jaati hai
 Then she says, 'everything is going very well
 aap yuva or khubasurat hai
 a lot of films are lying in your footsteps
 aap kaam main vyast hai
 Then one day you realize that suddenly the offers of films came down and then slowly stopped
 kya aap budha rahi thim? nahin, bamushkil aap 32 kii bhi nahin thim
 Then one day the phone rings and you are asked to roll the law
 thode dinon main aap bal safed kar maa kii bhoomika nibhaane lagati hai
 'the film is a scene from The Dirty Picture: a film is under shooting
 bamushkil tees saal kii ek sundar-si ladki ke baalo ko safed rang kar, use safed sari pahanaakar 62 saal ke nasiruddin shah kii maa bana diya gaya he
 The girl has a glow on her face and wants to unravel the secret of the wrinkles of Naseer, who is growing old and very tight pants and all makeup
 tabhi ek samvaad he, 'vaah sooryakanth ji, kal tak aap unke saath naach rahe the or aaj unhen apni maa bana daalaa
 Film critic Bhavana Somaya says, "our society has divided every role of woman in the grooves of age
 20 saal main vah premika he, 25 main bivi, 30 paar maa or 40 ke baad daadi-nani
 The same situation is with our films too
 'yahaan umr ke calendar se jindagi chalati he
 Nobody asks the ability
 1988 main ai superhit film qayaamat se qayaamat tak se aamir khan or juhi chawla ne apane filmi kariyar kii shuruyaat kii or phir 2000 main phir bhi dil he hindustani bataur lead heroin unki aakhri film sabit hui
 The roles continued to be played later, but small and marginal
 juhi misses mehta ban gayi, lekin aamir aaj bhi superstar hai
 Juhi lacked talent or was less obsessed with acting? She says, "we know from day one that this career is not very long and our innings will be over soon
" pishan main kami nahin he, role hai hi nahin
 'why only Juhi, there is a long list of actors whose careers barely ended by crossing 35
 unka aparaadh sirf yahi tha ki ve mard nahin thim
 46-year-old Padmini Kolhapure's career was her heroine in Rishi Kapoor's first hit film Prem Rog and then Anil Kapoor in Seven Days (1983)
 das saal filmon main dhooma machaane ke baad padmini gaayab ho gayi
 But both Kapoor became more young with old age
 unke daravaaje par barason tak filmon ke ofer liye nirmaataaon kaa tantaa laga rahaa
 Pooja Bhatt, Urmila Matondkar, Raveena, Manisha Koirala, Tabu, Karisma
 
 
 jane kitne to naam hai
 All of them were top heroines of their time
 aamir, shahrukh, salmaan, ajay devgan or akshay kumaar ke saath inaki jodi hit thi
 Time turned both their hair white
 fark sirf itnaa he ki hero safed baalo ko kaala kar aaj bhi filmon ke nayak hai, jawan ladakiyon ke saath galabahiyaan kar rahe hai or budha rahi heroinon ne sthaayee kareer 'shaadi' ko chun liya he
 He did not leave his career because he had to get married
 shaadi isliye kii kyonki kareer chhot gaya tha
 Are marriage and career enemies of each other? In the West, even after marriage and two children, women get the Oscar for Best Actress even after countless wrinkles of old age
 hamaara desh hi itnaa gaya-gujara kyon he? hamaare paas to khush rahane ko gaalib ye khyal bhi nahin he ki koi ek hi udhaaharan hota, jise poster kii tarah chipkaakar ham khush hote
 No heroine got married at the peak of her career and the one who did it, she immediately fell down and fell down
 duusari ore hruthik roshan ne pehali hi superhit film ke baad shaadi kar lee or aaj bhi superstar hai
 Imran Khan has recently got married and yet his career is yet to come
 lekin sonakshi or deepika agar kal shaadi kar len to parason unke kareer kaa kiria-karam ho jayega
 In the contract of the big film house, it is written that while working in his company, the heroine can neither marry nor have children
 iske peeche koun-sa manovigyaan he? cinema ke manovishleshan par mahatvapurn kitaaben likhane vaale psico analist sudhir kakkad kehete hai, 'bhartiya hameshaa manovaigyanik rup se filmon se judate hai
 The woman dancing on screen is not just an actor

 'miss Tanakpur Hazir Ho' is a satirical film, in which there is sarcasm on the law, society, religion and the condition of women in the country
 kahani main gaanv ke ek ladke ko ek bhens se balaatkaar ke aarope main fansaa diya jaataa he iske baad aap dekhenge ki kis tarah vah kanoon ke kaayadon main ulajhata he
 This film is very effective as a story and an idea, which will take you on an interesting journey
 film ke dialog kai jagah hansaaenge
 The tempering of the language of Meerut and Muzaffarnagar is fun, the film gets derailed at some places and starts running on the tracks of Haryana
 tippaniyan Talking about acting, Rishita Bhatt has done a good job
 vahiin rahul bagga bhi apane qirdaar main fit hai
 But after watching the whole film, i liked the work of Rishita and Ravi Kishan more
 baaki kirdaaron kii dialog delivery main samanta nazar aati he isliye ve parde par apni chhap nahin chhod pate
 Filming of 'miss Tanakpura Hazir Ho' was a bit weak for me
 editing main kami thi
 If it were sharp, the film would not have slowed down in the first part
 mujhe lagata he film kaa screenple or ksaa hua ho saktaa tha
 But the good thing is that director Vinod Kapri has thrown light on the serious issues of society
 film apane vishay se nahin bhatakati
 The episodes that reach the climax of the story look a bit long
 kair, 'miss tanakpur haazir ho' kul milkaar ek aisi film he, jo aapkaa manoranjan karne ke saath-saath samaaj ko aainaa dikhaati he

 magar puri film dekhne ke baad mujhe rushita or ravi kishan kaa kaam zyaada acha laga
 The rest of the characters have a similarity in dialogue delivery so they are not able to leave their mark on the screen
 'miss tanakpura haazir ho' kaa filmakan mujhe zaraa kamazor laga
 There was a shortage in editing
 agar ye dhardaar hoti to film pehle bhaag main zyaada dhimi nahin padati
 i think the screenplay of the film could have been more tight

 The film does not deviate from its subject
 kahani ke charam par pahunchane ke dauraan jo kadiyaan aati hai vah thodi lambii dikhti hai

 RJD linked the attack on Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's convoy during the development review visit in Buxar with the lack of development work in the area, alleging that not a single brick is being added to the Mahadalit tolls, but still Nitish Kumar is in the state in Chaumukhi The rhetoric of development is different
 argedy netaa tejasvi yadav ne aarope lagaaya ki vikaas ke mudde par mahadalit tolon ke saath pakshpaat purna ravaiya apanaaya ja rahaa he or unki lagaataar andekhi kii ja rahi he
 Responding to these allegations of Tejashwi, the JDU has said that one thing is good that Tejashwi believed that development work was going on in Bihar
 party pravaktaa sanjay singh ne kaha ki vikaas ko lekar pakshpatpurna ravaiya apnaanaa tejasvi kii raajnneeti kaa hissaa hoga naa ki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa
 Sanjay Singh said that the only vision of Nitish's development is 'development of Har Bihari'
 tejasvi yadavapar tanj kasate hue jediu ne kaha ki vah 20 maheene tak nitish sarkaar main up-mukhyamantri ke pad par rahe magar unhen yah bhi yaad nahin he ki sarkaar ke saat nishchay kaarykram ko puraa karne kii samay seemaa kab tak kii he? sanjay singh ne kaha ki tejasvi yadav ko apane up-mukhyamantri kaal main hue koi bhi kaam yaad nahin he
 Sanjay Singh lashed out at Tejashwi, saying that with regard to Tejashwi, everyone says that they should learn the politics of politics right now
 argedy adhyakshalalu prasad yadavapar hamalaa bolte hue jediu ne kaha ki lalu-rabari shasankaal ke dauraan narsanhaar hone ke turant baad daliton ke bich vot kii siyasat karne pahunch jate the magar nitish kumaar ne to mahadaliton ko tirangaa fahraane kaa avasar diya he
 JDU said that Nitish never considered Dalit, Mahadalit as his vote bank but acted in favor of Mahadalits
 argedy ke dalit prem ko lekar jediu ne tejasvi par tanj ksaa or kaha kibenami sampattvarjit karne ke liye tejasvi ne kitna balidaan kiya he yah sirf daliton ne nahin balki puure desh ne dekha he
 Suddenly, the rise of Dalit love inside RJD was described by Sanjay Singh as restless to get power pleasure
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki jinhen (nitish kumaar) daliton kii phikr he vah vikaas samiksha yatra par nikle hue hai or tejasvi yadav apane sarkari bangale main baithkar blower kii hawa kha rahe hai

 What has happened in the last two days in the case of liquor businessman Vijay Mallya has caused a bit of a stir in Indian politics
 vijay maalya ne bataaya ki vah landan ravaanaa hone se pehle vitt mantriarun jetalise mila tha
 There is a ruckus on this issue
 ab is maamle kii kai paraten khulti ja rahi hai, kai khulaase aise hue hai jinase vitt mantri, sibiai or state bank of india sabhi sawaalon ke ghere main hai
 1
 vitt mantrise mulaakaat par sawalvijay maalya ne landan main kaha ki vah yahaan se jane se pehle arun jetali se mila tha
 On which Jaitley said that this meeting was not a formal one, but a forceful meeting while walking in the corridor of Parliament
 ab vitt mantri ke is daawey par congress ne sawaal uthaae hai
 Congress President Shahul Gandhi came to the media on Thursday with his fellow leader PL Punia and told that he was a witness to the meeting of mallya-jaitley
 congress sawaal uthaa rahi he ki agar vitt mantri arun jetali ne maalya se mulaakaat kii thi to unhone do saal se is baat ko desh ke saamne kyon nahin rakhaa
 Apart from this, Rahul Gandhi's question was that if Jaitley knew that Mallya was going then why did he not tell the CBI
 2
 The second major question arises from the CBI in the Crisis case taken by CBI in Lookout Circular
 darasal, guuruuvaar ko hi sibiai kii ore se bayaan aayaa ki sharaab kaarobaari vijay maalya ke khilaaf 2015 ke lukout circular main badlaav karke 'hiraasat' se badalakar uske avaagaman ke bare main keval soochna dena nirnay kii 'truti' thi kyonki vah jaanch main sahyog kar rahaa tha or uske khilaaf koi warrant nahin tha
 Actually, Vijay Mallya made two to three overseas trips after the circular was released
 videsh jane ke baad vah lagaataar bharat waapas aata rahaa, jisase sibiai ko laga ki vah sahyog kar rahaa he
 This has been the reason that when he left for London, no one noticed and he again turned out that he had not yet returned
 3
 The question raised by the lawyer on the State Bank of India, about the State Bank of India, an important character in the Vijay Mallya case, also came to a shocking point
 varisht vakil dushyant dave ne daawa kiya ki jab maalya desh se faraar hua usase kareeb 24 ghante pehle hi unhone SBI ko maalya kaa passport jabt karwaane kii salaah di thi
 According to him, 'I met SBI on Sunday
 is mulaakaat main maine esbiai ko salaah di ki wo somvaar ko supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataaye
 After this, according to the negotiated meeting, i reached the Supreme Court on time but the SBI team did not reach there
 mujhe andeh he ki mere salaah ke baad kuch to hua tha, kyonki esbiai chif mere salaah se sahamat the
 i don't know what happened between Sunday night to Monday morning

 In response to an RTI, the Anandiben Patel government has given this shocking reply
 darasal mumbai ke artiai activist anil galgali ne pradesh ke mukhyamantri or sabhi mantriyon kii sampatti kaa pichley 5 saal kaa byora maanga tha
 On this, the government refused to give information, saying that the property of the ministers and the chief minister is their personal matter and it has nothing to do with public interest

 Holding global reasons responsible for the steep fall of four percent in the Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensex on Friday, Finance Minister p Chidambaram said that domestic markets should not be so sensitive to the data coming from the US
 chidambaram ne kaha ki bhartiya bazaar main sthaneey paristhitiyaan jhalkani chahie
 "I have no doubt that peace will be restored in the domestic markets, people will begin to understand that the Indian market indices should basically reflect the circumstances of the Indian markets," the finance minister said in a separate interaction with reporters during an event on Friday
 unhen america se aane vaale aankadon ke prati itnaa samvedansheel nahin hona chahie
 The Sensex of the Bombay Stock Exchange fell nearly 769 points, or 4 per cent, on Friday, while the rupee also touched a new all-time low of 62 per dollar
 is dauraan sone kaa bhav 1,310 rupee uchhalkar 31,010 rupee prati 10 gram ho gaya
 Worried over this development in the markets, the Finance Minister said, "I believe it is a time of calm, it is a time of contemplation, however, let's see what happens next week
" unhone kaha ki buudhvaar se shuukravaar subah tak bhartiya arthvyavastha main koi aisi ghatana nahin hui, jisase bazaar main koi halchal ho
 Chidambaram said, despite this, the markets suffered a sharp setback, it also showed in rupee
 hamane kai upaay kiye hai
 
 
 Several measures are being taken, however, let us see what the first quarter economic growth figures are now
 america main berogari main giravat ke aankadon kaa puri duniya ke bazaaron par asar dekha gaya
 Chidambaram said, "how many people are waiting for jobs in America now or more people are waiting for jobs in America, how will this affect the basic condition of Indian economy
" aisa nahin hoga, iskaa asar nahin hoga, meraa maananaa he ki yah saadhaaran si baat he
 
 
 If these figures come down and go up, then they do not really have any relation or impact on the Indian economy
 tippaniyan Despite this, the market has always reacted to these signals whenever these figures come out of the US
 bazaaron ne 22 may ko bhi isi tarah pratikriya dikhaai, jab america ke fedral rigerv ke pramukh ben barnannake ne ek bayaan diya tha
 In the US, the market has reacted similarly to unemployment data, sometimes i wonder why the market reacts like this
 bharat ke maamle main chidambaram ne kaha, jahaan tak bharat kii baat he, guuruuvaar ko avkaash tha, isliye shuukravaar ko bhartiya bazaaron par do din kaa asar ek saath dikhaai diya
 This is the reason why this decline is appearing much larger

 This is the reason why this decline is appearing much larger
 bombai share bazaar kaa sensex shuukravaar ko kareeb 769 ank yani chaar pratishat ludhak gaya, jabaki rupaya bhi nae sarvakalik nimna str 62 rupee prati dollar ko chhu gaya
 During this period, gold rose by Rs 1,310 to Rs 31,010 per 10 grams
 bazaaron ke is ghatnakram se chintit vittamantri ne kaha, meraa maananaa he ki yah shant rahane kaa samay he, yah chintan kaa samay he, baharhaal, dekhte hai ki ab agle saptaah kya hota he
 He said that there was no such incident in the Indian economy from Wednesday to Friday morning, causing any stir in the market
 chidambaram ne kaha, baavjood iske, bazaaron ko tej jhatka laga, yah rupee main bhi dikhaa
 We have taken several measures
 
 
 kai upaay kiye ja rahe hai, baharhaal, dekhte hai ki ab pehali timahi ke aarthik vruddhi ke aankade kya rahete hai
 The decline in unemployment in the US saw the impact on the markets across the world
 chidambaram ne kaha, america main ab pehle se kam log rojgaar paane kii pratiksha main hai yaa phir america main kuch zyada log rojgaar milane kii pratiksha kar rahe hai, iskaa bhartiya arthvyavastha kii buniyadi sthiti par kis prakaar prabhaav padegaa
 It will not happen, it will not have any effect, i believe it is a simple matter
 
 
 yadi ye aankade neeche aate hai or upar jate hai, to inkaa bhartiya arthvyavastha par vastav main koi sambandh nahin he athwa koi asar nahin hoga
 The comments unhone kaha, iske baavjood bazaar ne hameshaa hi in sanketon par, jab bhi ye aankade america se baahar aate hai, pratikriya dikhaai he
 Markets reacted in a similar manner on May 22, when the US Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke made a statement
 america main berajgari ke aankadon par bhi bazaar ne usee tarah kii pratikriya dikhaai he, kabhi-kabhi mujhe aashcharya hota he, ki bazaar main aisi pratikriya kyon hoti he
 In the case of India, Chidambaram said, as far as India was concerned, Thursday was a holiday, so the impact of two days on the Indian markets appeared simultaneously on Friday
 yahi vajah he ki yah giravat zyada badi dikhaai de rahi he
 He said that there was no such incident in the Indian economy from Wednesday to Friday morning, causing any stir in the market
 chidambaram ne kaha, baavjood iske, bazaaron ko tej jhatka laga, yah rupee main bhi dikhaa
 We have taken several measures
