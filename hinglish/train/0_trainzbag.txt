 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator This is the Guru of Saurashtra, the beauty of hospitality and history
 yahaan sona sabase khara he, jangal kaa raja zyada hi rob main chalata he, rang kuch zyada hi rangile hai or josh had se adhik joshila
 Saurashtra is a clump of princely states and the politics here is also princely
 saat sampann jilon se sajaa saurashtra ilaaka gujarat se kai myanon main bhinn he
 Even in the 2002 riots, this area remained peaceful
 yahaan mudde sampradayik nahin, saamaajik hai, aarthik hai, aam janajivan se jude hai
 Of the 182 seats in Gujarat, 54 are in Saurashtra region
 agar is ilaake main koi baari uthaa patake hui, to gaddi dawandol ho sakati he
 Every political party realizes this
 tabhi to sonia gandhi ne bhi gujarat main bigul foonkane kii sochi, to shuruyaat rajkot se kii
 One of the major reasons for this is that political analysts are considering Saurashtra as the weakest link to Modi in Gujarat this time
 darasal rajya ke purv mukhyamantri keshubhai patel yani saurashtra ke sabase robeele netaa bijepi chhod chuke hai or parivartan kaa naaraa liye, gujarat parivartan party khadi kar chuke hai
 While Keshubhai is catching up in Saurashtra region, he has also been an expert of the organization
 2001 main jab keshubhai ko mukhyamantri pad se hataa kar modi kursi par kaabiz hue the, tab bhi dabe chupe vishwasghaat kaa card khelaa gaya tha
 The bearing did not show in the seats
 phir 2007 main keshubhai ne patel votaron se apil kii ki wo modi ko naa jitaayen
 The result was completely opposite
 par 2009 loksabhaa chunaavon main rajkot se bijepi ummidavaar ke khilaaf aisi hi apil rang laai
 And the party lost this seat for the first time in 20 years
 bijepi ke liye keshubhai ne eent dar eent gujarat main patel vot bank kaa nirmaan kiya tha
 The difficulty of estimating here is that in Gujarat, caste votes remain mostly divided
 paaramparik taur par kai patel congress ke paksh main vot karte hai
 In such a situation, whose vote bank will be infiltrated by Keshubhai, it is not clear
 modi kii talkhi or ghamand kii duhai dekar pichley ek dashak main kai kadradaavar baagi hue hai
 But Gujarat has not allowed Modi to be weak
 unki takat to is kadar badi he ki wo dilli tak kaa daawa thok rahe hai
 This is the reason why from Keshubhai to Congress are hurting on the issue which is directly related to the people
 saurashtra main jal sankatsaurashtra ko kudarat ne bepanaah kubsuurati di he
 If not given, then such a source of water which can quench the thirst of people and also the fields for 12 months
 ye ilaaka puri tarah barish ke pani par nirbhar he
 For the first time in Modi's 11-year tenure, Gujarat experienced a drought-like situation this year
 monsoon der se aayaa jarur, par durust nahin aayaa
 And by the time it arrived, about 48 farmers had given their lives
 inamen se adhiktar saurashtra ke kisaan the
 However, allegations were also made that the Modi government refused to accept most of the deaths as farmers' suicides
 nahin to ye aankada or zyada hota
 However, the feeling of pain wrapped in figures is for those who lost their loved ones
 aasmaan se badal kya bichade, 25 saal ke vikram kaa hausala hi bichhud gaya
 The burden of debt is such that Vikram gave his life by hanging on this tree in his field
 pita ko lakva maar gaya
 And the younger brother is struggling to raise a family of 15 people
 rajya sarkaar aatmahatya ko kisaan-aatmahatya kehane se parhez karti rahi
 But the Congress immediately handed over the check of lakhs and lakhs to every victim's family
 khayr parivaar ko chot muaavze kii kami se nahin pahunchi
 They are hurt no one took them even ye kissa bhale hi ek parivaar kaa ho, ye dastaan puraani he
 i wish our politicians could understand that pain does not take place during anger
 saurashtra ilaake kii is samasya se sab waakif hai
 But till now all efforts are limited on paper
 ab modi sarkaar ye daawa kar rahi he ki satta main lautate hi ghar ghar main pani hoga
 However, water is an issue which most people of Saurashtra associate with their fate
 is dfa kya pani par kheli aansuon kii raajnneeti voton kii barsaat karegi, dekhnaa hoga
 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has not taken any decision on the designation of the bjp-led opposition in the Delhi Assembly
 guuruuvaar ko patpadganj se vidhayak or bhavi dipti siem bataae ja rahe manish sisodiya ne kaha ki party ne abhi is bare main koi faisla nahin liya he, lekin vah is bare main vichaar karegi
 He said, 'at least let the BJP demand it
 abhi hamane is par koi faisla nahin liya he
 Remember that senior AAP leader Kumar Vishwas had tweeted on February 10, the day of the results, that even if the BJP brought less than seven seats, we would still give him the post of Leader of Opposition
 Even if BJP gets less thn 7 seats we will give LOP to BJP
 Democracy moves with acceptance
 — Dr Kumar Vishvas (@drkumarvishwas)february 10, 2015gauratlab he ki kisi vidhansabha yaa loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh kaa pad usee party ke vyakti ko diya ja saktaa he jisane kam se kam 10 fisadi siten jiti hon
 In the recent election results, the BJP has suffered a crushing defeat and won only 3 seats out of 70 seats
 haalanki samvidhan ke jaankaar bataate hai ki sarkaar chaahe to apni marji se 10 fisadi se kam siten jeetne vaali party ko bhi vipaksh kaa pad de sakati he
 The Congress won just 44 seats in the Lok Sabha, which is less than 10 per cent
 centre kii modi sarkaar ne congress ko netaa vipaksh kaa pad dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Senior BJP leader and MLA from Rohini Vijender Gupta says that he has no intention of seeking the post of Leader of Opposition from AAP

 kendriya soochna ayog (siaisi) ne kaha he ki sarkari adhikari artiai kanoon ke tahat soochna na dene ke liye 'filein gaayab hone' kaa bahaanaa nahin bana sakate
 The Commission has stated that such claims have no validity under the RTI Act designed to bring transparency
 soochna ayukta shridhar aacharyulu ne apane aadesh main kaha, 'jab tak yah sabit na ho jaae ki filein nasht karne yaa use roak kar rakhane kii niti ke tahat dastavej nasht kiye gaye, tab tak yah mana jayega ki adhikari ne use apane paas rakhaa he
 The case came to the CIC when a person named Om Prakash sought information from the Land and Building Department of Delhi Government regarding the allocation of an alternative plot in lieu of his land acquired by the government
 vibhaag ne ayog ke saamne sweekaar kiya ki sambandhit file gaayab he or artiai aavedan praapt karne ke baad adhikariyon dwaara vyaktigat taur par bhoomi evam bhawan vibhaag ke kamare kaa nirikshan karne ke baad bhi unka pataa nahin chal sakaa
 The officer appearing on behalf of the department said that there is no possibility of missing files now
 soochna ayukta ne kadai baratate hue kaha ki jin dastavejon ko hameshaa rakhana hota he or unka rakrakhaav karnaa hota he, yadi ve gaayab ho jaaen or kisi maamle main unhen saboot mana jaae to adhikariyon ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 201 ke tahat shikaayat darj kii ja sakati he
 Its seriousness can be gauged from the fact that if found guilty in this case, there can be a jail sentence of 7 to 10 years
 ayukta ne kaha, file gaayab hone yaa nahin mil paane ke daawey kii koi vaidhata nahin he kyonki ise artiai kanoon dwaara apwaad nahin mana gaya he
 The disappearance of the file is like a violation of the Public Records Act, 1993, which may carry a jail term of up to 5 years or fine or both

 kisaanon ke alaava middle class bhi bajet ko lekar sarkaar se bahut ummiden rakhata he

 India have lost only 16 wickets in the series so far while it battered South Africa badly in both Tests
 isse bharat ke dabadabe kaa anumaan bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Toss has also supported India so far and if Sikka favors Faf du Plessis in the final Test match, things can get a little exciting

 The issue of national security has come to the center of politics ever since the Indian Air Force carried out an attack on terror bases in Pakistan
 pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad desh main jo pakistan ke khilaaf gussa tha, uskaa asar bharat kii javaabi karrwai main dikhaa
 Aaj Tak has organized a special 'security meeting' today to discuss all these things, how India's stand should be against Pakistan after Airstrike
 'kitne surakshit hai ham' vishay par marxvaadi communist party (CPM) ke mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki rashtriya suraksha main paksh or vipaksh nahin hota
 Important for national security
 aatank ke khilaaf puraa desh, paksh or vipaksh donon ek saath khadey hai
 Terrorists want us to split up, we fight so that it benefits
 afsos kii baat he sarkaar or sarkaar se zyada media janata main foot failaane kii koshish karti he, jabaki hamaare bich ekta kii jarurat he
 He who is splitting, he is a traitor in the country and he who wants unity in the country is a patriot
 rashtriya suraksha par bolte hue yechuri ne kaha ki aatankwaad or suraksha kii baat aaj agenda par kyon aa rahi he? balakot ke baad kyon aa rahi he? aantarik suraksha or aatankwaad ko hameshaa se gambhir mudda he
 The security of the nation is always an issue, not just for elections
 2009 se 2014 ke 5 saalon se in 5 saalon kii tulana karen to in 5 saalon main 626 aatanki hamale hue jabaki uske pehle 5 saalon main kam the
 In those 5 years, 139 soldiers were martyred while in these 5 years 483 soldiers were martyred
 sijafire kii ghatnaayen jo pehle ke 5 saalon main 563 saal hue, in 5 saalon main 5000 se zyada sijafire kaa ulanghan hua he
 Why is the issue of national security only after Pulwama and Balakot? After that, so many of our soldiers were martyred, how many terror attacks took place, terrorist attacks took place inside Jammu
 hamaari kya satarkta he? sawaal ye hona chahie ki ham log surakshit hai ki nahin?intelligence kii naakaami kii baat par bole yechuripulavama hamale main intelligence kii naakaami kii baat par yechuri ne kaha ki pulavama hamale ke pehle intelligence naakaami thi jiskaa mudda sabase pehle jammu-kashmir ke rajyapal ne uthaaya or yah sawaal vaazib he
 Apart from the army, if it is a matter of security, should it be that our provider is safe or not? Our unemployed are walking around for help, is it safe? If you will limit all matters of security to one Balakot and you are talking about contesting elections on the basis of this, then it is an injustice to the biggest country
 air strike ke raajnneetikaran par yechuri bole ki bijepi adhyaksh ne air strike par raajnneetikaran shuru kiya or kaha ki ye congress kii sarkaar nahin he or bijepi kadi karrwai karegi
 We have said that we are against terrorism in every step of the government
 hamane airforce kii tarif kii uske agle din amit shah kii ore se raajnneetik bayaan aayaa
 The question is not that it has been politicized, but it will benefit only those terrorists who want to divide among us
 bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha ki 200 maare, rajnath singh ne kaha vahaan 300 mobile the jo hamale ke baad band ho gaye
 a cabinet minister said that 400 killed, but another cabinet minister said that our motive there was not to kill but to show our ability
 airforce chif ne sabhi sawaalon kaa jawaab diya or jisko puure desh ne salaam kiya
 He said that my job was to target and target him
 unhone apni jimmedaari ko bahaduree se nibhaayaa
 Yechury said that this issue of national security is always alive
 sabko milakar uske khilaaf ladanaa he
 This country is a devotee, it is anti-country
 ye sab bolkar aap aatankwaadiyon ke jaal main funs rahe ho
 You are compromising with the security of the country by greed to gain in an election
 Defence committee ke pramukh murali manohar joshi kii report kahati he ki dephence main nivesh 1962 ke baad ab tak sabase kam he
 If our security preparations are so weak, should we not discuss them? tu-tu, main-main se chunaav main vot mil jaaenge lekin kya uske liye desh ko girvee rakh doge? suraksha kii baat aap kar rahe hai to desh kii awam ko suraksha do
 Eradicate hunger, protect the Annadata, save the Annadata from committing suicide, give jobs to the youth
 yechuri ne aage kaha ki koi yah sawaal kyon nahin poochhate ki jab azhar masood aapaki hiraasat main tha to vah chuta kaise? koun use chhod kar ke aayaa tha? amritsar main us plane ko udne kii ijaajat kyon mili he? plane kandahar kaise gaya?duniya sawaal puch rahi he to unhen saboot dikhaaiyemasud ajahar par apana stand clear karte hue yechuri ne kaha ki masood ajahar ko antarrashtriya aatankwaadi ghoshit kiijie
 The question is, what will be the action? America, France and Britain are asking questions to give evidence
 hamen sena par bharosa he lekin duniya sawaal puch rahi he to unhen saboot dikhaaiye
 When there is no assembly elections in Kashmir, Yechury said that if the security system is good for the Lok Sabha elections, then why not for the assembly elections? If there is talk of political process in Kashmir, then you first become a part of democracy
 kashmir ke maamle main ek rodmap taiyaar hua tha jab rajnath singh ke netritv main ol party delygation 3 saal pehle kashmir gai thi or aane ke baad ek likhit bayaan jari kiya gaya tha jiske tahat kaha gaya tha ki confidence building major taiyaar ho, or sabhi steke holder ke saath baatcheet karen
 This path was put in front of the country, but if you want, then implement it also
 logon ko algaavvaadiyon se alag karo, yah sabase badi prakriya he
 One step to solve the problem of Kashmir is to separate people from separatists by winning
 is maamle main khud algaavvaadi hum or main chahta hum ki logon ko algaavvaadiyon se alag kiya jaae
 Modi is standing on one side, everybody is on the other side, speaking on the alliance of propaganda of this media, Yechury said that on one side, Modi stands on the other side, everybody is propaganda of the media
 hindustan main chunaav ke pehle koi mahagathbandhan nahin hua
 There was a grand alliance in 1996, 1998 and 2004, but similarly there will be a grand alliance after the 2019 elections
 agar modi kehete hai ki yah mahagathbandhan maha milawat he to phir hamaara desh hi ek milawat he jahaan bengal se lekar rajasthan main, kashmir se lekar kanyakumari tak ham sab mil jul kar rahete hai
 Bharat means adulteration
 ham sab mil jul kar rahete hai
 You want to erase that which is against the country
 15 saal pehle jab yahi sawaal tha jab kaha ki vaajapeyi kaa vikalp kya hoga? hamane kaha tha ki vikalp desh kii janata se aayega or vah vikalp janata ke bich se aayaa jiske baad lagaataar 10 saal pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke netritv main desh main sthirataa rahi
 The Left has fallen on electoral grounds, but the Left is setting the agenda to bring the issue to the people

 At the same time, in the 2012 UP Assembly elections, 25 fighting over 403 seats

 It is being told that in this time table, on one side, Mamta Banerjee is congratulating the Muslim brothers for this holy festival, while the picture of Mecca has been placed behind them
 muslimon kaa kahana he ki makka jaisi pavitra jagah kii tasviir peeche chhapavakar sidhe-sidhe musalamaanon kaa apmaan kiya gaya he
 He says that Mamta has not done well by printing a picture while reading her prayers and it is against the Muslim religion
 muslim dharm main kisi bhi tasviir yaa murti kaa pujan manaa he
 In fact, the Trinamool Congress in Burdwan has published a time-list of Sahri and Iftar, in which the picture of Mamta reciting Namaz is printed on the front page and the biggest thing is that the picture of Mecca has been printed on the back page
 gauratlab he ki makka musalmaan kaa sabase bada dharmasthan he
 The Muslims of Burdwan say that it is devoid of Mecca

 He says that Mecca is our religious place and it is an insult to reprint it on the leaflet, it should have been printed on the first page

 The views of the RSS have not changed on the AMU
 Regarding the conversation with the RSS of AMU Vice Chancellor Jamir Uddin Shah, a highly placed source said that in a democratic system, anyone is free to meet and speak
 iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki aresas eemyu ke bare main apane vichaar main koi badlaav laane ja rahaa he
 Waiting for the court's decision on AMU, the previous governments of the country created illusions about Aligarh Muslim University being a minority institution and tried to mislead the court again and again, any benefit to the country or AMU by repeating it Not gonna happen yah maamla absupreme courtmen lambit he or nyaayalay ke faisle se hi aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay ke alpsankhyak charitra kaa bhavishya bhi tay hoga, lihaaja sabhi ko faisle kaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 rss's soft approach to AMU? Significantly, Aligarh Muslim University vice-chancellor Jamir Uddin Shah has claimed that the RSS has spoken about taking a soft stand about AMU

 america raashtrapati baraak obama35 minute tak bole
 People liked his talk - and applause rang several times in between
 baaki sab to thik he, magar


obama ne sabhi netaaon se garmjoshi se haath milaae
 The hug met Prime Minister Narendra Modi as if his friendship was childhood
 baat-baat par tarif main kaside padhate rahe
 Every detail of the Republic Day parade kept on observing and constantly understood about Modi
 kya puure vakt unke dimag main kuch or chal rahaa tha? bijness or newclear deal jaise masale kya mahaj aupchaariktaaon ke daayre main bandhe agenda ke bindu bhar the? kya asli agenda kuch or hi tha?or jate-jate unhone apane man kii baat [haalanki ‘man kii baat’ kaarykram pehle hi record kar liya gaya tha, jise obama ke jane ke baad prasaarit kiya gaya] kah di, “bharat tab tak safalataa arjeet karata rahegaa jab tak vah dharmik aadhaar par bante nahin
 "obama mentioned education and equal opportunity in both the United States and India and said - that's why a tea seller becomes a prime minister and a cook's grandson becomes president
 obama ne aisi kai khubasurat misaalen deen lekin sabase zyada jor dharmik sahishnutaa par hi rahaa
 Is it really Obama's real concern for India? In the context of who or not the government? Congress leader Digvijay Singh has advised Modi to take a lesson from Obama's speech
 haalanki unhone sawaal uthaaya he ki modi main itnaa saahas nahin ki vah dharm parivartan ke mudde ko lekar andolan chalaane vaale vishwa hindu parishad or sangh ke logon ko roak paaenge
 RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav has alleged that Obama has put a blackmail on the face of BJP and RSS
 lalu poochhate hai, “pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bataanaa chahie ki unke achche dost jo kah kar gaye hai, us par ab kya karenge? ghar vaapasi kaa inkaa kaarykram jari rahegaa yaa band hoga?”vaise ganatantr diwas kii purv sandhya par raashtra ke naam apane sambodhan main raashtrapati pranab mukherjee bhi kah chuke hai ki dharm ko takaraav kii vajah nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 In his address, the President also condemned 'frenzied competition'
 or, bijepi pravaktaa jiviel narsimha raav kaa kahana he ki dharmik sahishnutaa or swatantraaa na keval samvidhan, balki yah is desh kii mahaan parampara kaa hissaa rahaa he
 We have been teaching this lesson to the world for thousands of years
 bijepi pravaktaa ke mutabik yah kahana galat hoga ki obama ne dharmik sahishnutaa or swatantraaa kii baat modi sarkaar ke sandarbh main kahi he
 Talk, business and brand ambassadorobama said that India will be successful as long as it is not divided on religious lines and people beyond their faith will continue to watch movies of actors like Shahrukh and clap, just like Milkha Singh or Mary Kom They celebrate in the name of
 duniya kii sabase charchit hasti or manze hue communicator maane jane vaale obama ne apni baat rakhane ke liye khaas taur par alag alag dharmik becogroundwale teen celibrity chune – shahrukh khan, milkha singh or meri com – ek muslim, ek sikh or ek isaai
 There is a fund of marketing - if a celebrity understands something, then it goes straight to their heart

 'americans no how to do business?' What is the biggest lesson? Sometimes 'love Jihad' and sometimes 'homecoming'
 kabhi ‘chaar’ to kabhi ‘10’ bachche paidaa karne kii salaah
 These issues have been in the news in recent times
 kya in saare vivaadon ke peeche sirf kori raajnneeti he
 Or, a strategic exercise to promote a particular kind of idiology? Is this a thoughtful political trick behind implementing a hidden agenda? First Lok Sabha elections were held
 uske baad maharashtra, haryana, jharkhand or jammu kashmir ke vidhansabha chunaav hue
 Right now the electoral atmosphere in Delhi is in full swing
 bihar or pashchim bengal bhi is qatari main hai
 Are the violent incidents from Muzaffarnagar to Muzaffarpur indicate anything special? Is there an attempt to spoil the atmosphere before the elections? Is this vote bank politics? After all what is happening? Is American President Obama just saying this to Prime Minister Modi or something
 bahes lambii ho sakati he, par baat main dam to he

 According to sources, the price of petrol may increase as the oil companies can reconsider the prices of petrol again
 petrol kii maujuuda keemat par apni aantarik baithak ke baad hi tel companiyaan ye faisla karengi ki petrol kii keemat main ijapha kiya jaae yaa nahin
 Although it is not yet known how much it will be if the price increases, but according to the reports received, there has been an increase of up to Rs 3 per liter of petrol
 aakandon ke mutabik tel companiyon ko philhal 1 litre petrol par 2 rupee se zyada kaa ghaataa ho rahaa he
 Oil companies argue that this deficit is happening after rising crude oil prices in the international market
 saath hi pichley kuch dinon main kamjor hue rupee kii vajah se bhi petrol kii keemat par dabaav badha he
 You will be surprised to know that in 2011 itself, petrol prices have increased 3 times
 is saal pehali baar 16 janvari ko dilli main petrol 55
 58 increased from Rs 87
 37 paise ho gaya
 After that, on May 15, the price increased from 58 rupees 37 paise to 63 rupees 37 paise
 1 july ko keemat 63 rupye 37 paise se badakar 63 rupye 70 paise ho gai bad sakati he petrol kii keemat is khabar se aam janata bhi pareshaan he
 Their problem is also reasonable because if the price of petrol increases, then the prices of other things will also increase
 ab agar petrol ke daam badhate hai to phir ek saal main chauthi baar aisa hoga or aap abhi se hi is jatke ke liye taiyaar ho jaaie

 The Supreme Court has reprimanded the Bihar government in the case of recruitment of policemen across the country
 sarkaar ke rodmap par nyaayalay ne mangalvaar ko gahari naaraazgi jataai
 Chief Justice JS Khehar said that the person making such a proposal should be sent to jail
 sarkaar hamaara majaak naa banaae, ham sarkaar ke pulicekarmiyon kii bhartee par najar rakh rahe hai
 The Chief Justice said that the government is saying that in July 2019 i
e
 two and a half years, the recruitment of 86 stenographers will be completed
 
 
 kya is kaam main itnaa vakt lagegaa? aapako chahie ki stenography test karen or logon kaa chayan karen
 Along with this, the Supreme Court turned down the Bihar government roadmap and asked for additional secretary to be presented again on Friday with the new roadmap
 vahiin, kai sawaal-jawaab karne ke baad supreme court ne pashchim bengal sarkaar ke rodmap par muhar lagaai
 According to this, the state government will fill 4,537 vacancies out of the posts of 25,487 soldiers in July 2017, while for the next three years it will recruit 8,000 constables every year
 isi tarah 800 sab inspectoron kii bhartee 2020 tak puri hogi
 The process of hiring 76 deputy sps in the state has also been asked to complete soon
 25 april ko sijeai jees khehar kii extra class chali
 In this, the top officers of six states including UP were present
 chif justise ne kaha ki hamen itihaas-bhugol nahin chahie, yah bataaie ki pulicekarmiyon kii riktiyaan kab puri hongi
 Court 5 instead of 4 o'clock
 36 baje tak chalaa
 At the same time, till the vacant posts in the Uttar Pradesh Police are completely filled, 32,000 policemen will be recruited every year
 supreme court ne yogi sarkaar ke road map ko manjuuri de di thi
 The government has said that the recruitment of 11,376 sub-inspectors will start from January 2018 and will be completed by January 2023
 har saal 3,200 sab inspectoron kii bhartee hogi
 Not only this, the recruitment of 1,01,619 soldiers will start from August 2017, which will be completed by September 2021
 yani har saal 30 hazaar sipaahiyon kii bhartee hogi
 The Supreme Court has asked the UP government to recruit only according to the affidavit
 agar aisa nahin kiya gaya to pradhan sachiv (grih) nijee taur par jimmedaar honge
 The Chairman of the Police Recruitment Board will not be changed until the recruitment starts every year and the results are declared
 sunwaayee main 6 rajya upi, bihar, jharkhand, karnataka, tamilnadu or pashchim bengal ke bade afasaron ko rodmap ke saath supreme court ne talab kiya tha
 CJI Khehar had said that the matter has been pending since 2013, but nothing happened in these states
 notice bhejne ke baavjood koi kadam nahin uthaaya gaya
 Now the court will monitor the matter and keep an eye on the recruitments
 CJI ne upi sarkaar se kaha ki he aap logon ko rojgaar kyon nahin dete or itane pad kyon khaali hai
 However UP said that its efforts are on
 report ke mutabik, upi main 1,51,679, bihar main 34,000, jharkhand main 26,303, karnataka main 24,399, tamilnadu main 19,803, bengal main 3,325 pulicekarmiyon kii riktiyaan hai
 The comments desh main pulicekarmiyon kii bhartee ke maamle main pichhali sunwaayee main supreme court ne rajyon ke ravaiye par naaraazgi jataai thi
 CJI Khehar had said that to maintain law and order, appointments to all police posts are necessary
 sabhi rajyon ke grih sachiv teen hafte ke bheetar halafanama daakhil kar court ko bataaen ki pulicekarmiyon kii niyukti ke liye wo kya kar rahe hai? kitne pad khaali hai? centre sarkaar ek hafte ke bheetar sabhi rajya sarkaron ko court kaa aadesh bheje
 The court warned that the state secretaries who do not file affidavits will summon the home secretary
 justise khehar ne kaha ki 2015 kaa record bataata he ki desh main 4 lakh 33 hajaar pulicekarmiyon kii kami he
 In 2014, Chhattisgarh said that 3,800 posts are vacant in their place and now the government is telling that 10,000 policemen are to be appointed
 aise main ab sab rajya court ko bataaen ki unke yahaan kitne pad khaali hai or kya ho rahaa he? court deshbhar kii police ke liye kalyankari yojanaon ke liye daakhil janhit yachika par sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 The petition said that commissions have been made for all government departments and facilities are being provided, but no attention is paid to the police
 desh main kareeb 50 fisadi pulicekarmiyon kii kami he or pulisavaalon ke liye awaas or anya suvidhaayen bhi nahin hai
 Because of this, there is a problem in maintaining law and order
 chif justise ne kaha ki sarkaar kah rahi he ki july 2019 yani dhai saal main 86 stenographer kii bhartee puri hogi
 
 
 Will this work take so long? You should do stenography test and select people
 iske saath hi supreme court ne bihar sarkaar ke rodmap ko bhi thukraa diya or nae rodmap ke saath shuukravaar ko dobaaraa adishnal seketry ko pesh hone ko kaha
 At the same time, after many questions and answers, the Supreme Court stamped the roadmap of the West Bengal government

 vahiin, uttar pradesh police main khaali padon ke puri tarah bhare jane tak har saal 32 hajaar pulicekarmiyon kii bhartiyon hongi
 The Supreme Court had approved the road map of the Yogi government
 sarkaar ne kaha he ki 11,376 sab inspector kii bhartee janvari 2018 se shuru hogi or janvari 2023 tak puri hogi
 Every year, 3,200 sub-inspectors will be recruited
 yahi nahin, 1,01,619 sipaahiyon kii bhartee agast 2017 se shuru hogi, joki sitambar 2021 tak puri hogi
 That is, every year 30 thousand soldiers will be recruited
 supreme court ne upi sarkaar se kaha he ki vah tay halafanaame ke mutabik hi bhartee kare
 If not done, the Principal Secretary (home) will be privately responsible
 har saal kii bhartee shuru hone se or parinaam ghoshit hone tak police bhartee board kaa chairman nahin badla jayega
 In the hearing, senior officers of 6 states UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were summoned by the Supreme Court with a roadmap

 With regard to developing the writing style as per today's need, says Padmabhushan Gulzar, it is like a potter, who can make many kinds of utensils
 isi tarah yadi aap apana kaam jaanate hai, to aap kuch bhi likh sakate hai
 There is no question of style

 Pollution is a major problem in the national capital Delhi and work to tackle it starts when it reaches the top level

 It is believed that after the implementation of this action plan, along with dealing with pollution, Delhi's environment will also be improved

 In such a situation, these questions often arise, why the government preparations remain incomplete every year to deal with pollution? Why does the government fail to stop Delhi's pollution? On January 2, the Kejriwal government submitted an action plan to the environment ministry to prevent pollution in Delhi and improve the environment
 kendriya paryaavaran mantralay ko is ection plan ko hari jhandi deni he, jiske liye engiti ne mantralay ko 4 hafte kaa vakt diya he
 The Environment Ministry says that from 2010 till now, the Delhi government was asked three times to give an action plan report on climate change, but it has not given and now has given
 dilli sarkaar kii taraf se mantralay ko saunpe gaye climet change se jude is ection plan main sirf vaayu pradooshan kaa hi nahin, balki jal pradooshan ko rokane or lagaataar neeche ja rahe dilli ke jal str ko badhaane ke upaay bhi shaamil hai
 Apart from this, the action plan also mentions how to use water for farming, so that water is not polluted
 agar is ection plan ko 4 hafte main lagu kar diya gaya, to is baar november main shuru hone vaali sardiyon ke dauraanpradooshanaka str bhi kam rah saktaa he or dilli main apatkaaleen jaise halaat paidaa hone se pehle isko niyantrit karnaa sarkaar or agenciyon ke liye aasaan hoga
 Earlier, the NGT had taken tough decisions ranging from ordering the closure of illegal industries in Delhi to imposing a fine of Rs 50 crore on the Kejriwal government
 in kade faisle ke peeche engiti kii manshaa yah he kidilli ke pradooshanpar lagaam lage or paryaavaran behatar karne main sarkaar kuch kargar kadam uthaae
 In Bollywood, Nandita Das is counted as a great actress
 glamras or chakachaundh vaale bollywood (bollywood) se dur vah acting kii nai vidhaon ko aajamaane main yakeen rakhti hai
 Away from the parties and events of b Town, Nandita Das likes to be merry in her life
 apane phens or chaahane waalon se judane ke liye nandita bhi anya kalakaaron kii tarah soshal media kaa istemaal karti hai lekin aksar unhen trobers ke saath do-chaar hote hue dekha jaataa he
 In this episode, Nandita Das on Ambedkar Jayanti tweeted that many of her political party supporters were angry
 “bhakti in religion may be a road to the salvation of the soul
 But in politics, Bhakti or hero-worship is a sure road to degradation and to eventual dictatorship
 ” Dr BR Ambedkar, 25th November 1949, last speech in constituent assembly # ambedkarjayanti Nandita Das (nandita Das) wrote some excerpts of her speech in the House on the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti on her Twitter account
 nandita ke anusaar 25 november 1949 ko doctor bhimrao ambedkar ne sadan main apana antim bhaashan diya tha
 In which he said that the path of devotion to religion leads to the liberation of the soul but in politics the path of devotion or devotion to a particular person leads to degradation and dictatorship
 nandita ke is twit kaa arth sirf unhen hi pataa hoga lekin soshal media par baithe logon ne unke twit par sawaal uthaanaa shuru kar die
 People saw this by connecting with PM Modi and Congress and trolled fiercely
 Nandita @nanditadas 
 
 Isn't that applicable to Congress too? Seems like everyone's bhakti there is towards one family and its whims and fancies
 You never read out these line before 2014
 Still you are advocating one family rule
 Please tell that Nandita Das often tweets about political parties
 haal hi main unhone 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon (lok Sabha Election 2019) ko lekar ek twit main kaha tha ki is baar ke chunaavon main mahasoos ho rahaa he ki ek taraf khai he to duusari taraf kuan
 He also faced resentment on social media due to his statement
 gaur ho ki nandita 10 bhashaaon main kareeb 30 filmon main kaam kar chuki hai, jisamen mrinal sen, adur gopalkrishnan, shyaam benegal, deepa mehta or maniratnam jaise nirdeshak shaamil hai
 Rawat later met Governor NN Vohra at Raj Bhavan and discussed the entire security situation in the valley
 (input ieenes se bhi) Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan, who has been battling security-related questions after the Mumbai attacks, said it was a mistake for the Congress to agree to hand over the responsibility of the Home Ministry to the NCP
 chavaan ne kaha, ‘meri raay main vah ek galati thi
 We should revisit this
 mujhe kisi bhi aise duusari gathbandhan sarkaar ke bare main nahin pataa he, jahaan grih, vitt or yojana vibhaag kii jimmedaari mukhyamantri ke paas na ho
 Chavan told a TV channel, "when the congress-ncp came to power in the state for the first time in 1999, there was an agreement on the division of departments which was the model adopted during Shiv sena-bjp rule in 1995-99
 based on
 ’mukhyamantri kii yah tippanee aise samay main ai he, jab mumbai main 26 / 11 ko hue aatanki ghatana ke baad tatkaaleen grih mantri evam rakanpa netaa aar aar patil ne apane pad se istipha de diya tha
 He said, 'this is a unique alliance
 lekin meraa maananaa he ki yah koi bada mudda nahin he
 Both of us (congress and NCP) come from the Congress culture

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi blamed the erstwhile governments and the then Congress President Sonia Gandhi for not fulfilling the promise of providing electricity to every home in the country
 guuruuvaar ko pradhanmantri ne kaha ki congress varsh 2009 tak har ghar tak bijli pahunchane ke apane chunavi vaade ko puraa karne main vifal rahi
 Talking to the beneficiaries of 'sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana' (saubhagya), the Prime Minister said, 'the previous governments made promises, but they failed to fulfill them
 tatkaaleen congress adhyaksh (sonia gandhi) ne vaada kiya tha ki varsh 2009 tak sabhi gharon main bijli pahunchaai jaaegi lekin 2009, 2010 or 2011 tak bhi yah nahin hua
 Modi said that the previous governments failed because their leaders were not serious and now they are looking for flaws in the schemes and programs being implemented by the current government
 unhone kaha ki 28 april 2018 tak desh ke har gaanv main bijli pahunch gai
 It is a historical date
 yah dukh kii baat he ki aazaadee ke 70 saalon baad tak desh ke logon ke paas bijli nahin thi
 It is noteworthy that the Rs 16,320 crore Saubhagya scheme was launched in September last year
 iske tahatbijliki roshni se ab tak vanchit 3
 The target is to reach 6 crore homes by 31 March 2019
 haalanki, sarkaar in gharon ko 31 disambar 2018 tak roshan karne kaa lakshya lekar chal rahi he
 Earlier this month, the power ministers of all the states and union territories had made a commitment to provide electricity to all the houses by 31 December 2018 in a meeting held in Shimla
 purv kendriyamantri shashi tharur ne apni patni sunanda pushkar kii maut kii vajah ko 'spasht or nishchit nishkarsh' par pahunchane ke liye buudhvaar ko ek twarit jaanch kii maang kii
 In fact, Tharoor's remarks came in the wake of a senior forensic specialist doctor who allegedly claimed that he was pressurized to influence the autopsy report in the case
 tharur ne kaha ki apni patni sunanda ko khone ke baad or shuru se hi maine adhikariyon se ek gahan jaanch karaane or ise teji se tathaa paardarshita ke saath nishkarsh tak le jane kaa anurodh kiya he
 In a statement on Facebook, he said, 'I repeat my request to bring this long investigation to a clear and definitive conclusion as soon as possible, so that all speculation can be put to rest
 ' He said that the Pushkar family has the same idea and 'we have given full cooperation to the authorities
 ' Significantly, Dr
 Sudhir Gupta, the head of the forensic science department of AIIMS and who led Sunanda's autopsy panel, has alleged that he was pressurized to make Sunanda's death natural, which he opposed did
 is bich, swasthya mantri harsh vardhan ne kaha he ki unhone ames ke nideshak ko patr likhakar aaropon par vistrut soochna maangi he
 Significantly, on the night of 17 January, Sunanda was found dead in a five-star hotel in South Delhi
 iske ek din pehle hi pakistani patrkaar meher taraar ke saath unki twitor par bahes hui thi
 The debate took place over Mehr's alleged links with Tharoor

 Apart from this, Indian government teams are also engaged in it

 Several senior officials are on the spot, including the Railway Board Chairman, General Manager Northern Railway
 hamaare paas maujuud sansadhano ko yahaan lagaaya gaya he
 Asked what action the Railways would take on this incident, Sinha said that the incident did not happen due to the fault of the Railways
 trek ke bagal main is tarah kaa kaarykram yojit kiya gaya or railway ko kisi prakaar kii soochna nahin di gai
 If there was information, we would have issued instructions in advance
 sinha ne aage kaha ki driver ko pehle se jo bhi nirdesh die jate hai, jahaan speed restriction rahete hai, vahaan wo gati ko dhimaa karata he
 My first priority is that we can make better arrangements for the families and the injured
 vahiin, duusari ore amritsar haadase ko lekar centre sarkaar or rajya sarkaar ne ek-duusare par thikaar phodna shuru kar diya he
 The central government has placed the responsibility of Amritsar train accident on the Punjab government and the local administration of Amritsar
 rail rajyamantri manoj sinha ne kaha ki railway se aisi koi guzarish nahin kii gai thi ki train trek ke paas ravan dahan kiya jayega or use dekhte hue koi intjaam kiya jaae
 After this accident, the question was started that if the program of Ravana Dahan is organized here every year, then the railways should run the trains at a slow pace
 rail rajyamantri khud hi sthiti kaa jayja lene ke liye punjab ja rahe hai
 At the same time, Navjot Kaur, who was present as a guest in the Ravana Dahan program, has put the responsibility of the accident on the railway
 ve punjab sarkaar main mantri navjot singh siddhu kii patni hai
 An eyewitness told that the incident occurred due to the mistake of the administration and the Dussehra Committee
 unhen yah sunishchit karnaa chahie tha ki kaarykram ke dauraan yahaan par train kii speed dhimi rakhi jaae, lekin aisa nahin kiya ja sakaa
 It is being told that Ravana Dahan was held near the train track and firecrackers were being heard while the effigy of Ravana was burnt and could not hear the sound of the incoming train
 manoj sinha ne kaha ki swaabhaavik taur par railway trek ke najadik aise kaaryakramon kaa aayojan nahin kiya janaa chahie
 He said that it should not be made a political issue
 ham sabhi ko milakar logon ko raahat pahunchaani chahie

 amritsar ke sab divijan magistrate rajesh sharma ne kaha ki 50 shav baraamad kar liye gaye hai or kareeb 50 ghayalon ko aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 It is being told that the effigy of Ravana was being burnt near the railway track at Jojda Phatikalake in Amritsar

 dosaal pehle jab bharat, japan or america ne videsh mantriyon kii ab tak kii apni pehali baithak kii thi to nai dilli ne bahut saavdhaanee ke saath kaha tha ki ise ''china ke khilaaf koi kadam nahin samajha janaa chahie
 "two years later, New Delhi would like to say the same thing
" lekin 18 sitambar ko neuyork main jab bharat kii videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj, japani videsh mantri taaro cono or america videsh mantri rex tilarsan jab mili to china kaa saaya pehle se kahin zyada bade rup main mandaraata maaloom pad rahaa tha
 Concern over China's rise was certainly affecting the three-nation system that has deviated its way since it was formed six years ago
 sachiv str kii baatcheet kaa darja badhaakar use obama ke shashan kaal main videsh mantriyon ke str kaa kar diya gaya tha lekin pichley saal donald trump ne america pehle (america fasrt) kii niti apana lee thi or asia se america ke alag hone kaa sanket de diya
 The US then broke away from the trans-pacific Partnership trade deal and demanded that Japan and South Korea pay a fair share, in order to maintain defense alliances as partners with the US
 trump ne paris jalwaayu samjhaute se america ko alag kar saaf kar diya ki america hit pehle he
 But if Beijing is happy that now they have become autocratic in Asia due to the separation of America, then it is clear from some recent events that this is not the case
 uttar korea se nibatane se lekar dakshin china sagar tak america jahaajon kii adhik awajahi kaa saaf sanket he ki aarthik maamalon main duuri kaa matlab yah nahin he ki is kshetra main america kii ruchi nahin he
 Indeed, indications are that the US is fully prepared to demonstrate military strength
 aise main neuyork main 18 sitambar kii baithak kaaphi mahatvapurn rahi
 At the meeting, there was a consensus among the three countries that it was necessary to preserve the model of security under the leadership of the US in Asia, which benefited India and Japan, although this was under pressure from the growing power of China
 pichley saal kii tarah teenon deshon ne yah doharaaya he ki unhen nauparivahan or vyapaar kii aazaadee sunishchit karne kii jarurat he
 At the same time, America and Japan understood India's concerns about efforts to increase Chinese connectivity in the region going a step further
 haalanki america or japan ne may main china ke raashtrapati shi jinping ke 'belt and road forum' ke liye apane pratinidhi bheje the par bharat ne bahishkaar kiya tha
 The position expressed by India in the statements of both countries was almost verbatim repeated
 dilli ke nazariye se ek kadaa sandesh diya gaya tha ki 'van belt, van road' (obioar) kii yojana ko lekar bharat apni chintaaon ko lekar akelaa nahin he
 The three countries stressed the need to build a basic link based on 'universally respected' international rules, proper economic cooperation and 'respect for sovereignty and regional unity'
 neuyork kii baithak ne bhale hi teenon deshon ke bich badhati ekta kaa majboot sandesh diya ho lekin yah abhi ek shuruyaat bhar he
 Changing its function is a different matter
 beijing is bare main jaanata he ki teenon main yah ekta abhi itani sudrudh bhi nahin he
 The Malabar naval exercise between the three countries this year, which also included aircraft vessels this year, is perhaps an exception
 bharat or japan obioar ke vikalp ke taur par ek asia africa growth coridor banane kii yojana par baat kar rahe hai lekin yah dekhnaa hoga ki bharat jis kachua chaal se ab tak chalata rahaa he, use dekhte hue yah yojana kitni safal ho paati he
 In addition, Trump has been facing domestic problems one after the other, causing indecision with the US friendly countries in Asia and on the other hand they are moving into China's economic orbit
 beijing ne ab tak bahut saavdhaanee ke saath pratikriya di he
 China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying reiterated China's view that "regional countries form partnerships rather than coalitions
" '' hua ne bharat-japan ke sanyukt bayaan kaa zikr karte hue yah bhi kaha ki ''maine bayaan main 'china' shabd kaa ullekh tak nahin paaya he
 But it seems the Japanese and Indian media are more concerned about the possible 'confusion' of China in this statement
 mujhe lagata he ki media bayaan kaa jarurat se zyada arth nikaal rahaa he yaa phir media kii atakalon kii tarah japan or bharat, donon kaa koi gupt agenda he
 ' rajkoshiya asantulan ke pahaad ke neeche khadi america arthvyavastha ke liye fouran rasta nikaalane kii jarurat ko dekhte hue america raashtrapati baraak obama bade din kii chuttee bich main hi chhodkar hawaii se washington laut rahe hai
 The comments obama is samay parivaar or mitrajanon ke saath hawaii dweep par hai
 His wife and children will return after completing their leave
 raashtrapati bhawan ne kaha, guuruuvaar shaam, raashtrapati hawaii dweep chhodkar waapas washington disi ke liye prasthaan karenge
 His wife and daughters will live in Hawaii
 pichley saptaah hawaii ravaanaa hone se pehle obama ne samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha tha, main congress (sansad) ke prayek sadsy se guzarish karuunga ki ve ghar jaakar is bare main sochen
 Think about your obligations to the people who sent us here
 unhone kaha, hamaare paas samay seemaa kaa sankat he

 bihar ke bahucharchit gaya roderej maamle main nayaa mode aa gaya he
 All the five witnesses in this case have turned their back
 iske baad aisa prathit ho rahaa he ki is maamle main jis 17 varshiya aditya sachdeva kii maut hui thi, use kisi ne nahin maaraa tha
 This question is also bound to arise due to the reversal of witnesses
 kyonki pichley 15 dinon main is maamle ke sabhi mukhya gavaah baari-baari se apane pehle bayaan se mukar gaye hai
 Due to which this matter has become very weak
 ab ek bada sawaal saamne he ki kya aditya sachdeva ko insaaf mil paaegaa?darasal, isi saal may ke maheene main 17 varshiya aditya sachdeva apane chaar anya doston ke saath berthde party manaa kar swift car se waapas gaya laut rahaa tha
 At the same time, Rocky Yadav, riding in the SUV Landrover, coming in the back of his car, had asked for the pass and when not given the pass, Rocky Yadav stopped the car of Aditya Sachdeva and his friends and shot and killed Aditya Sachdeva
 
 aditya ke chaar dost aayush agarwal, ankit, naseer or caphi ne ghatana ke baad dhara 164 ke tahat magistrate ke saamne apnaabayandarj karaae the
 In the statement, he said that his friend Aditya was killed by Rocky Yadav
 wo gaya ke bahubali mafia don bindeshwar yadav or janata dal united kii vidhaan parshad manorama devi kaa betaa he
 But in the past 15 days, Aditya's four friends turned away from their earlier statements and expressed their inability to identify whether Rocky Yadav was the person who shot Aditya Sachdeva in the incident
 chaaron doston kaa kahana he kyonki jis jagah par ghatana ghati thi, us vakt shaam ho chuki thi or kaaphi andhera tha
 So he did not clearly see who shot Aditya
 aditya ke chaaron doston ke apane bayaan se mukar jane ke baad aditya ke mata pita kaaphi sadamein main he
 He is not sure whether his son will ever get it or not
 aditya sachdeva kii maa chand sachdeva kaa kahana ki unhen samaj main nahin aa rahaa he kya maamla aakhir kis taraf ja rahaa he
 They are only expecting the judiciary after the four friends of Aditya turned away from their statements
 is puure maamle main aditya ke chaar dost hi bayaan se nahin palate hai, balki sunil kumaar naam kaa wo sipaahi bhi palat gaya jo is puure maamle main gavaah tha
 The one who gave the statement that he had seen how Rocky Yadav's Pitabindeshwar Yadav helped his accused son escape after the incident
 sipaahi sunil kumaar kaa bayaan palat jane se yah puraa maamla behad kamjor ho chukaa he
 In such a situation, the question arises that due to the manner in which five witnesses have turned hostile in the last 15 days, why did the police not provide protection to all these witnesses so that they can tell the truth in the court
 haalanki abhiyojan paksh kaa abhi bhi maananaa he ki police ke paas vaigyanik, forensik or paristhitik saboot paryaapt he taaki aditya sachdeva ko is puure maamle main nyaay dilaayaa ja sake

 Recently, Akhlaq's son also met the DGP of UP and demanded a re-investigation into the matter

 The price of tomatoes in Pakistan's largest city Karachi reached a record high of Rs 400 a kg on Tuesday
 tamaato ke aayaat par pratibandh sahit kai kaaran he jisaki vajah se daam chadha he
 This information has been given in the media report

 bataa den, karachi main logon ko pichley hafte us vakt jhatka laga jab tamaato kii keemat 300 rupee kilo se badhkar buudhvaar ko 400 rupee prati kilogram ho gai
 Prices have risen this year due to low tomato yields
 ek vyapaaree ne kaha, ‘abhi iran or swat ke tamaato karachi main bik rahe hai or isaki baari kami he, jisaki vajah se keemton main oochaal aayaa he
 Earlier this month, the official retail price of tomatoes was Rs 117 per kg
 report main kaha gaya he ki tamaato kii keemat main vruddhi ke liye sangheey sarkaar ko doshi tehraaya ja saktaa he, kyonki usne kisi bhi vyapaaree dwaara muft aayaat kii anumati dene ke bajaay kuch logon ke liye aayaat ko simit kar diya he
 It states that as a result, a limited amount of tomatoes at the Taftan border were sold after already being booked

 maadhuri dikshit, hindi cinema kaa aisa naam jisaki muskuraahat ke lakhon diwane hai
 If Madhuri dances then crores of people say the same
 
 
 maar daalaa
 Seeing this grace of Madhuri, Karan Johar and director Abhishek Varman tried to hit the film Kalank
 lekin maadhuri kaa wo tilism kalank main tuutata najar aayaa
 Madhuri Dixit was cast in two songs in Kalank
 pehla gaanaa ghar more paradesiya main unhen aalia ke saath dikhaaya gaya
 Before the release of the song, the audience felt that they would get to see the jugalbandi of both
 lekin puure gane main aalia ne clasical dance ke skills dikhaae
 The audience, who were waiting for Madhuri to dance, had to sigh only after seeing them in the entire song
 haalanki is gane main maadhuri ke geoup ko dekhakar ye jarur laga ki mekars ne diziner lahangon par to jamkar kaam kiya, lekin aalia ke lahange ke aage maadhuri ke lahange kaa gres gaayab dikhaa
 There is nothing in Madhuri's lehenga that was seen in Chandramukhi's lehenga
 kalank main jahaan aalia kaa lahanga khubasurat dikh rahaa he, vahiin maadhuri kaa lahanga feekaa najar aa rahaa he
 If you look at Madhuri's hairstyle, it seems like the makers would go to a cheap shop
 puure gane main maadhuri ke luk ko actress ke wig ne khatm kar diya
 View this post on Instagram Felt blessed playing a character so mysterious and enchanting

 is gane kii relies se pehle kii maadhuri ne kai intervyuu main kaha ki gane ko mere devdas ke 'maar daalaa
 
 
 'do not compare to songs
 is baat ko bhi maadhuri ke phens ne maan liya, kyonki maadhuri kuch bhi kar den wo laajawab kar degaa
 Eventually the stigma was destroyed and the song was released
 is gane se wo ummiden thim, jo aasmaan ko chhu rahi thim
 It was felt that once again, Madhuri's style, beautiful laughter will make the entire festival in her name
 lekin yahaan bhi phens bas yaheen kah sake
 
 
 Completely ruined
 kalank ke tabah ho gaye
 
 
 Madhuri danced in the song but Madhuri's soul was missing after seeing the entire song, like a machine has been rehearsed on a classical song
 ab tak jahaan ankhiyaan milaauun
 
 
 Ki Chublly Madhuri, Hum Aapke Hain Kaun Nisha who dances, taunts Devdas's Chandramukhi, whose fans are fans
 wo jaadu gaayab tha
 Just like this, wearing an orange lehenga, dressed up and dancing is Madhuri's lookalike
 mana ki ye sad song tha lekin maadhuri ke hone ke baavjood ise dekhakar na to aah nikali or na vaah
 There was no pain in the song, which was telling of the songs
 maadhuri kaa ankhon main wo dard nahin tha jo ye bataa paata ki koi apni tabaahi kaa dard suna rahaa he
 View this post on instagrambegum ki shaandaar duniya dekhiye! # kalankteaser is out, guys! 
 The people are crazy
 wo ek baar hans de to film main jaan phoonk de
 If his footsteps started popping, then just make the film a hit
 lekin ye sari chijen kalank ke gane main gaayab raheen
 Madhuri's tired, aged face just appeared throughout the song
 ek aisa cheharaa, jisase wo hansi gaayab thi, jisaki duniya divaani he
 Missing were those who slaughtered with the help of one eye

 💛☺ # throwbackthursdaya post shared bymadhuri Dixit (@madhuridixitnene) onmar 6, 2019 at 11:23 pm PST At the moment, the stigma has been released, but the stigma has risen in words that ask where have we been
 , Where did Devdas's Chandramukhi ye jo kalank kii bahaar begum ai hai, unke aane par bahaar kyon gaayab he? Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has said that Shreyas Iyer and Manish Pandey could prove to be a headache for Lokesh Rahul for the number-4 batting order
 team india ke liye limited overon kii cricket main number-4 kaa ballebaaji kram lambey samay se charchaa kaa vishay bana hua he
 Rahul was tried at this number in the World Cup, but later he started batting openings
 shreyas ayyar ko haal hi main windies daure par vanade main number-5 par mauka diya gaya tha jiskaa unhone donon haathon se upyog kiya tha or do ardhashatak jamaaye the
 Iyer has also strengthened his claim to No
 4 on the basis of good batting at No
 5
 lokesh rahul haalanki khel ke teenon praaroop main alag-alag form main hai
 Due to poor form, Rahul has lost his place in the Test team
 ganguli ne angreji akhbaar times of india main apane kollam main likhaa he, 'rohit or shikhar dhawan salaami jodi ke taur par tike hai isliye rahul ko neeche aana padegaa
 He has lost his place in the Test and Iyer and Pandey will be troubled by him in the limited overs
 'purv captain ne likhaa, 'ayyar ko tii-20 main jagah mil gai he jiskaa kaaran westeindies ke khilaaf vanade main unka shandaar pradarshan he

 narendra modi ke bulaave par pakistan ke wajire-ajam navaj sharif ne unke shapath grahan samaaroh main shirkat karke maukey kii garima badhaai
 He avoided the UN resolution or the embarrassing political rhetoric, keeping in mind the opportunity
 lekin hindustan kii videsh sachiv sujatha singh ne aisa shishtachar nahin dikhaaya
 He referred to the Mumbai terror attack and sought to expedite the trial against the seven Pakistanis accused of his conspiracy
 unke is tarah siyaasi nukte chhedgaye ke baavjood sharif ne ‘‘kashmir’’ kaa vivaadaaspad masalaa na uthaakar gharelu morche par tikhi aalochana kaa jokhim uthaaya
 If the results were to be one-sided, then the first question is, should Nawaz have accepted the invitation? All the time, the taunts are saying: The Sharif stepped into his stupor and Narendra Modi cleverly shook his web Caught in sharif ne bilatiort aage badaae kaa iraadaa jataayaa or kaarobaar tathaa logon ke bich aapasi rishton kii ahmiyat par jor diya, lekin modi ne hameshaa kii tarah aatankwaad se judi sharton kaa purana raag alapa
 Sharif took the leap but Modi did not move even one step
 kya yahi asal tasviir he? parade ke peeche kya-kya hua? donon taraf ke saarvajanik bayaan ghante bhar kii baatcheet main ubhari jamini hakeekat ke bare main nazariye se kaise alag hai? beshak, south block kii aadhikarik press relies puri tasviir pesh nahin karti he
 Sharif had made it clear from day one that he has to accept the invitation to attend the swearing in of the newly elected Prime Minister of India
 unhone vivaad se bachane ke liye jaan-boojhkar iskaa elaan kuch der se hone diya
 According to senior journalist Najam Sethi, Sharif did not ask permission from the army, just filled it with information
 unhone videsh vibhaag se brifing jarur lee, magar iesai yaa kisi or se koi baat nahin kii
 The National Security Advisor Sartaj Aziz and the State Department had advised him to attend the swearing-in ceremony and dinner and not to return to the same day, to engage in bilateral talks
 sharif ko maaloom tha ki is salaah main fouj kii raay bhi shaamil he
 High commanders had no problem, provided they did not take any concrete initiative on their part in two-way negotiations
 ve chaahate the ki aisa baad main tareeke se kiya jaae
 When Sharif saw the brief, he knew what it meant
 fouj ke mukhiya general rahil sharif itvaar ko punjab ke mukhyamantri shahabaaz sharif se in masalon par baatcheet ke liye mili
 The General told the Prime Minister's brother that Mian Saheb has not taken a brief from us, so we let you know with your opinion
 mukhyamantri se kaha gaya ki fouj pradhanmantri se hindustan ke morche par dhire chalane kii himachati he
 Despite the clear message from the rulers, Prime Minister Sharif decided to proceed on his own terms
 sethi kehete hai, ‘‘unhone bilatiort baatcheet par jor dekar apni gardan fansaa lee he or agar hindustani sharton par jor dete rahe to is maukey kaa sambhavit jaadu bekaar chalaa jayega
 Journalist Ejaz Haider believes that Modi showed cleverness, implicated Sharif in hospitality and later showed his attitude
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘sharif isamen funs gaye or isliye funs gaye kyonki ve vaaki is maukey ko aage kii raah kholane main tabdeel karnaa chaahate the
 But this was a misunderstanding
 jaraa virodhabhas par najar daalieh modi ne maang rakhi or baatcheet kii prakriya ko kareeb-kareeb thimpu daur ke pehle ke halaat main le jane kii koshish kii, jabaki sharif yah sochakar ol party hurriyat conference ke netaaon se mulaakaat ko taal gaye ki kahin maahaul na bighad jaae
 "haider believes that nothing like this would have happened if Sharif had not sent himself to the speaker of the National Assembly in the cycle of creating new history
" dusron kaa maananaa he ki sharif ne apni press conference main kashmir kaa zikr na karke or kashmiri algaavvaadiyon se mulaakaat na karke faujee hukmaranon or pakistan aadhaarit jehadi guton ko kadaa sandesh diya he
 Shortly after Modi's victory in India, meeting Kashmiri separatists would have been a politically incorrect move

 Muhammad Taki said, "mian saheb probably felt that due to the security regime of the country, the credibility of Pakistan and the rest of the world has remained modest, so at least this new initiative is not allowed to go away
" needed
 ’’ in sab baton par gaur karne se yah mulaakaat ek maamuli pahal hi lagati he, koi badi kutanyik chalaang nahin
 According to insiders, Sharif told the Prime Minister of India in bilateral talks that there is no point in imposing a condition on the conversation or repeating old things or accusations
 donon hi mulkon ko bhavishya kii ore dekhnaa chahie or raste kii rukaawaton ko dur karne ke bare main sochna chahie
 Sharif told Modi that he did not give the Congress government a new name for the Unrestricted Access to Market (NDMA) -MFN (most favored country) so that it could not be used against the BJP in elections
 sharif ne siachin se fouj hataane, vija ko aasaan banane or cricket khilne ko lekar bhi baat kii
 Most importantly, he also talked about opening up a wider scope of dialogue on Kashmir
 miyaan sahab kii kutanyik soch sahi lagati he
 On the occasion of new possibilities, due to the old rant, Sharif's efforts could be spoiled
 beshak, sharif mulk main majahabi or siyaasi guton ke nishane par honge, jo fouj ke sur main hi sur milaate hai kyonki hindustan se takaraav kaayam rakhana unke vajood ke liye jaruri he, na ki pakistan ke liye
 Dr
 taki kehete hai, ‘‘miyaan sahab ko apane peeche dekhne kii bhi sahi salaah di gai hogi kyonki jo log pakistan main har minute unmaad failaane kii koshishon main lage rahete hai, unke liye koi or kargil, mumbai yaa 11 aktubar, 1999 ko anjaam dena mushkil nahin he
 For them, the front is open in their own house and not in Delhi

 He says, "it was Sadbhavna Yatra
" sharif baar-baar lahore ghoshnaa or vaajapeyi ke saath apane talmail kaa hawala dekar 1999 kii rajamandi ko aage badhaane kii koshish kar rahe the
 In February 1999, Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee reached Pakistan on a bus that started between the two countries
 unka vah daura hindustan or pakistan ke atomi pareekshanon ke baad rishte sudhaarney kii nai pahal ke taur par dekha gaya tha
 Sharif and Vajpayee signed the bilateral agreement "lahore Declaration", which was ratified by the Parliament of India and Pakistan
 fouj sharif sarkaar kii aman kii koshishon se khush nahin thi or unhone kargil jang ke jariye in prayaason ko beasar karne kii koshish kii
 This act increased tensions between Sharif and the army chief, General Pervez Musharraf
 isse na sirf aman kii koshish bekaar gai, balki aktubar, 1999 main faujee takhtapalat main sharif sarkaar kii vidaai ho gai
 During his recent visit to Delhi, Sharif reiterated his intention to visit Vajpayee at his home and establish peace with India once again
 unka maananaa he ki bijepi or modi vaajapeyi kii viraasat ko aage badhayenge
 Imtiaz Alam believes that this is the right time to start bilateral talks, but it seems that Delhi will still wait for Pakistan's attitude on terrorism
 apane shapath grahan samaaroh main saarc deshon ke netaaon ko nyauta dekar modi ne is kshetra ke bare main apane sarokaaron par jor diya he, or sharif bhi vahi najariya rakhte hai
 Says Alam, "the situation demands that talks should not be held hostage to basic issues on both sides
" yah dekhnaa baaki he ki modi apni kattar yaa yuddh karne vaali chhavi se aage jate hai yaa afghanistan kii chhadam jang main ulajhakar rah jate hai
 "many in Pakistan are apprehensive that Modi will take a more aggressive stance in Afghanistan
" rajnatik tippaneekar umr javed kaa maananaa he ki donon netaaon ko ek-duusare kii gharelu majaburiyon kaa ehsaas he
 Sharif, by accepting invitations with the leaders of other SAARC countries, has recognized the need for improving India's somewhat regional status and improving relations, even in his own interests
 unke apane hit apane mulk main aarthik tarakkee or fouj par avam kii saraparasti kaayam karnaa he
 In Javed's opinion, Sharif's and his party's leaders take a different view from the military and the attitude of the hardliners like lashkar-e-taiba to the attacking positions
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘tarakkee kii donon kii samaj ke centre main vyapaar hoga or gujarat jaise bhartiya rajyon ko menuphaccharing main badhat mil sakati he to pakistan ke punjab main bhi phayda ho saktaa he kyonki vahaan kaa bazaar upabhoktaaon se bharaa padaa he
 He also believes that both Sharif and Modi have the same basic support base and that of the ambitious middle class and business houses
 isi vajah se ek khaas tarah kii aarthik tarakkee kii jarurat kaa ehsaas unhen he
 a compromise and action plan is already ready in the matter of business, which is yet to be announced to Pakistan
 vah narendra modi ke achche sanket kaa intjaar kar rahaa he
 Both Nawaz Sharif and Modi are powerful prime ministers, but it is yet to be seen whether they are able to deliver on their promises
 (lekhika pakistan main swatantra patrkaar hai) After the terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament, the government ordered the armed forces to mobilize
 lekin jab bhartiya sena 11 janvari ko taiyaar hui to na sirf pakistani sena lamaband ho chuki thi balki islamabad yah guarantee dene ke liye bhi taiyaar tha ki vah apni jameen se hone vaali sabhi aatanki gatividhiyon ko khatm kar degaa
 That time passed

 Despite the claim that the army has adopted the new 'immediate readiness' doctrine, there are no signs of any other military activity other than regular training
 bharat ko pakistan ke mukaable vaayu sena or nausena main gunvattta or sankhya bal ke maamle main badhat hasil he, lekin unki thal senaayen lagbhag barabari par hai
 The Indian Army is almost double the size of the Pakistani Army, but about a quarter of the army is engaged in taking front from the militants and a large part is stationed along the indo-china border
 bhartiya sena kii samasyaayein sabhi teenon kshetron main hai- sanghathan, hathiyaar va upkaran or siddhant va rajnatik disha
 In the early 1980s, the political directive for the three armies was to adopt the principle of 'prohibitive resistance' with Pakistan and 'defensive resistance' with China
