 Fourth Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge of Hyderabad
 rabindra reddy ne faisla sunaane ke kuch hi ghanton ke baad istipha de diya
 According to him, he had been thinking about resigning for some time and this decision had nothing to do with the Mecca Masjid case
 haalanki istipha dene ke samay ne kai logon ko chakit or sajeesh kii baat sochane waalon ko protsaahit kiya
 Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi said he found the decision of the judge 'intriguing'
 unhone enie ko andhaa or baharaa tota bataaya
 The NIA says it will investigate the verdict, but given the lack of evidence, few people expect it to appeal against it
 enie ko maamla saunpe jane se pehle ek pramukh aaropee swamasseemanandko dhamaake se sambandh hone ke aarope main pehali baar sibiai ne 2010 main giraftaar kiya tha
 He was also accused in the 2007 Ajmer Dargah bomb blast that killed three people and was acquitted in March last year
 enie ne us faisle ke khilaaf apil nahin kii
 Aseemanand also faced charges in connection with the second blast in 2007 — the Samjhauta Express from New Delhi to Lahore, although now finding it difficult to be convicted in one case after being acquitted in two cases
 vah aseemanand kaa hi bayaan tha, jisane 2007 or 2008 ke dauraan bam dhamaakon ke sambandh main seemapar aatankwaad kii bajaae kahani ko gharelu hindu aatankwaad ke rup main badal diya
 The Hyderabad police had initially suspected a Pakistani jihadist organization and had surrounded Muslim youth
 sibiai ko jaanch saunpe jane se pehle hyderabad police ne paanch sandigdhon ko pesh kiya, jinhone kathith taur par apane bangladeshi sahyogiyon se ardex hasil karnaa sweekaar kiya tha
 The CBI arrested Aseemanand, though he later retracted from his statement, claiming that the statement was taken under pressure from him
 sibiai ne aise hindu dharmik samoohon ke bare main kahaniyaan ikattha kin, jinhone mandiron par hamale kaa badla lene ke liye yojana banaai or use moort rup diya, lekin vah isaki nishchit rup se kadiyaan nahin jod pai or 2011 main is maamle ko jaanch ke liye enie ko saunp diya
 The NIA proceeded on the cbi's line, but could not produce significant evidence in favor of its story in court
 yaa to sibiai yaa enie yaa donon ne is jaanch ko gaddamdd kar diya
 On the condition of anonymity, an insider said that the NIA investigators had not adequately prepared the 226 witnesses listed for hearing, a large number of them turned against the NIA
 gavaahon kaa palat janaa ajmer dargah, samjhauta express or maalegaanv bam dhamaakon ke maamalon kii bhi visheshta rahi he
 In the Malegaon case, Special Public Prosecutor Rohini Salian had said that after the BJP came to power at the Center, the NIA had asked them to be soft on the accused
 yah sarkaar ke aalochakon ke sandehon kii pushti karata he, jo daawa karte hai ki kattarpanthi hindu guton ke krityon par karrwai kii sarkaar kii koi ichha nahin
 "after exonerating them, our fight against terrorism has weakened," says Owaisi
 ’’hamaare saamne yah rahasy ab bhi bana hua he ki makka masjid main kisne dhamaakaa kiya
 Devendra Gupta, who had admitted involvement with Aseemanand in the bomb blast, was sentenced to life imprisonment on charges of planning in the Ajmer Dargah blast case
 sirf paanch maheenon ke antar par hue in dhamaakon ke taar judate hai? darjanon gavaah kyon palat gaye? enie shunya se phir jaanch shuru karegi? jin logon ne 18 may, 2007 ko parijanon ko khoyaa, unka desh kii pramukh jaanch agency ke adhikariyon ke ghutane techne se nishchit mohabhang hua hoga

 tanushri datta ne 10 saal pehle ai film 'horn oke plis' kii shooting ke daurannaanaa patekarpar chhedchhad karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 In an interview in the last days, Nanushree has said that Nana wanted to be intimate during an item song, but she was not ready for it
 is bayaan ke baad kai dinon se hangaamaa machaa hua he
 Now on this whole matter, Abrakhi Sawantka statement has come out
 vaise to raakhi saavant ko controvarsi queen mana jaataa he unka bayaan yahaan isliye myne rakhata he kyonki 'horn oke plis' ke ek gane main raakhi saavant ne hi tanushri datta ko riples kiya tha
 Rakhi Sawant recently presented her side of the media that i had replaced Tanu in the song 'horn Ok Please'
 raakhi ne bataaya, "tanu ne film ke gane ko shoot kiya tha lekin use bich main chhod diya
 After that i got a call from choreographer Ganesh Acharya, he just said, come on set, you have to sing
 " raakhi ne kaha, "unki baat sunakar main hairaan rah gai kyonki achaanak koun sa gaanaa?" ganesh acharya ne bolaa, "bas raakhi tum aa jaao, gaanaa maine banaaya he, abhi shoot karnaa he
 Rakhi told, i also got a call from Nana Patekar
 wo bolne lage ki tum gaanaa kar do
 When i heard this, i reached the set immediately
 "rakhi told that after reaching the set i came to know that the song is from Tanushree
 wo is gane ko thodaa shoot kar chuki hai lekin lekin ab wo kooperate nahin kar rahi he
 Right now she is in her vanity, where she has gone to call him all but she is not coming out
 iske baad raakhi ne kaha, "us vakt daiji shah master ji kii assistant thi or usne sari baat bataai ki wo khud tanushri ko bulaane 10 baar gayi thi lekin unhone darwaja nahin kholaa
 "rakhi said," Nana Patekar said to me, no matter how you handle everything because there is such a big set, there are more than 100 dancers
 produsar kaa paisa laga he, wo mar jayega
 Rakhi said, when i heard everything, i myself went to call Tanu but she did not come
 phir maine unke hair dreser or mechap artist ko phone kiya
 Then i came to know the real reason "rakhi Sawant revealed," Tanu was unconscious in the van carrying drugs for 4 hours that day
 tanu aaj badi-badi baaten kar rahi hai
 But i want to tell their reality to everyone
 raakhi ne kaha, jab maine tanu kaa gaanaa kiya to unhone mujhe notice bhi bheja
 But the team of the film saved me and said that Rakhi has helped us at the last moment "rakhi says that i am with Nana Patekar ji till my death
 main ganesh acharya ke saath kai gane kar chuki hum
 Tanushree is running a wasteful METOO campaign
 kya he puraa maamla?tanushri ne naanaa patekar par shooting ke dauraan budtamiji or chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya he
 He accused Nana of trying to force himself with him during the shooting of a film in 2008
 unhone kaha tha, ''naanaa patekar jabaran kareeb aana chaahate the, ve shooting ke dauraan gane kaa hissaa nahin the, baavjood unhone unke saath intimet hone kii koshish kii
 The song's choreographer Ganesh Acharya, director Rakesh Sarang and producer Sami Siddiqui are all aware of this, but nobody did anything
 '' tanushri ne kaha tha naanaa heroinon ko peetate the
 Everyone in the industry knows that he has always been like this about heroines
 is maamle main ganesh acharya kaa riection saamne aa chukaa he
 Ganesh has given a clean chit to Nana
 jiske baad tanushri ne ganesh ko jhootha or dogala kaha
 What did Nana say on Tanushree's allegations? Nana Patekar said in a conversation with Bombay Times, "right now i am shooting in Jaisalmer
 jaise hi main 7 yaa 8 oktober ko mumbai pahunchoongaa to ek press conference karuunga
 i want to answer every question in front of the camera
 aap mujhase kuch bhi puch sakate hai
 i have no reason to hide
 'naanaa ne aage kaha, ''yah aap par he ki aap kis baat par bharosa karnaa chaahate hai
 Do you think I'm such a dirty person? Don't people know anything about me mujhe mere achche charitra ko sabit karne kii jarurat nahin he

 supreme court main ayodhya cese kaa 34waan dinmuslim paksh kii ore se daleelein jarisupreme court main aaj ramajnmabhumi-babari masjid vivaad kii rojaanaa sunwaayee kaa 34waan din he
 The arguments of the Muslim side continued till Friday (27 September), even today the Muslim side is giving its arguments
 iske baad hindu paksh kii ore se unka jawaab diya jayega
 After this reply, the trial will begin in the court on suit-4
 hindu paksh kii daleel shuru hone se pehle muslim paksh kii ore se shekhar nafade ne apni baat adaalat main kahi, ab nizam pasha apni daleelein rakh rahe hai
 Big update of the hearing on Monday: 02
 52 pm:ayodhya sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court main muslim paksh kii ore se nism pasha ne kaha ki quran or haddees ke mutabik bhi koi kaise bhi masjid bana saktaa he
 Mosques can be built on any land without minarets and wazukhanas
 unhone kaha ki pehle kabhi mandir bhi rahaa ho, vahaan bhi masjid banaai ja sakati he
 Nizam Pasha said that even if there is an idol in the mosque or if there are pictures or idols that are not visible in the walls or pillars, the prayers are valid
 masjidon main ghantiyaan bhi isliye manaa hai kyonki rasul ko ghantiyon kii awaz pasand nahin thi
 Ibne Battuta also wrote that there were bells in many places even in mosques in India
 muslim paksh kii ore se kaha gaya ki babar panipat kii ladaai jeetne ke baad nizamuddin or qutub sahab kii dargah par gaya
 It is wrong to say that nowhere in Islam is the tomb allowed
 agar ek baar masjid ban jaae phir imaarat gir bhi jaae to wo masjid hi rahati he
 Justice Bobde on this is not a condition of constant prayers? On this Nizam Pasha said that even if a man reads Namaz, the mosque stays
 ye kahana bhi galat he ki masjid main sona or khaanaa bananaa manaa he, ye saamaajik or saanskrithik sthal he
 Those coming to the Jamaat stay here
 is par justise nazir ne kaha ki ye islam kaa indian varjan he
 01
 55 pm:supreme court main muslim paksh kii ore se nism pasha ne kaha ki masjid ke dizin kaa sharia se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The Quran was no law for the sovereign emperor then
 lihaaza quran kii kasuti par babar ke masjid banane ko paap nahin kah sakate kyonki us samay raja ke har kadam or kaary ko sharia ke mutabik dekhne kii zarurat nahin thi
 01
 12 pm:ayodhya sunwaayee ke dauraan ramalala virajman ne supreme court se kaha ki ham madhyasthata main bhaag nahin lenge
 The court should decide on this isapar supreme court ne kaha ki ham sunwaayee kar rahe hai or 18 oktober tak bahes hogi
 01
 16 pm:sunwaayee ke dauraan chif justise ranjan gogoi ne kaha ki hamen is maamle main samaysima kaa dhyaan he, agar jarurat padi to shanivaar ko bhi sunwaayee jari rahegi
 12
 50 pm:muslim paksh kii ore se nizam pasha ne kaha ki jab babar raaj kar rahaa tha to vah samprabhu tha, kisi ke prati javabdeh nahin tha
 He ruled according to the law and the Quran
 virdohi paksh kah rahe hai ki babar ne masjid banaakar paap kiya, lekin usne koi bhi paap nahin kiya
 During this, Justice Bobde said that we are not sitting here to decide the sin-virtue of Babur, we are sitting here to test the claim on legal possession
 12
 40 PM: On behalf of the Muslim side, Nizam Pasha said in the court that according to the petition-historical record, in 1885 the miscreants entered the building and tried to worship and occupy it
 vairaagiyon ne ram chabutare par kabja kiya tha
 The court said that this is a legal issue
 muslim paksh kii ore se vakil ne kaha ki babar us vakt sabase oonchi gaddi par tha, isliye usne masjid banane kaa aadesh diya
 12
 30 pm:ayodhya cese par sunwaayee ke dauraan muslim paksh se shekhar nafade ne kaha ki hinduon kii ore se yachika mandir banane ke liye daayar kii gai thi, aise main faisla pehle hi ho chukaa he
 Therefore, we cannot raise the issue again and again
 muslim paksh kii ore se ab nizam pasha daleel pesh kar rahe hai
 Nizam Pasha is pleading on behalf of Haji Mehboob
 muslim paksh kii ore se kaha ki hindu yachikakarta ke to naam main hi ‘nirmoh’ he, aise main unhen jameen kaa moh nahin rakhana chahie
 However, he said that we all should proceed here through legal methods
 11
 20 AM: Monday is the 34th day of hearing of the Ayodhya case
 muslim paksh kii ore se varisht vakil shekhar nafade ne kaha ki mahant ke paas ayodhya main puja karne kaa adhikaar nahin tha, unhen ye adhikaar 1885 ke baad mila he
 Hearing to end by October 18? Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said several times during the hearing that the hearing of this case is going on due to the deadline, so everyone should try to end the hearing of the case by October 18
 chif justise ne ye bhi kaha ki agar 18 oktober tak sunwaayee khatm nahin hoti he to jald faisle kii ummid khatm ho jaaegi
 Since then, there is a hope of verdict in this case
 hafte main paanch din sunwaayee, samay bhi zyada18 oktober tak sunwaayee khatm karne ke liye adaalat main puri koshishen chal rahi hai
 The hearing of the case is going on five days a week, as well as hearing the arguments of more than one hour lawyers in the court every day
 iske alaava supreme court kii ore se kaha gaya he ki agar jarurat padati he to vah shanivaar ko bhi maamla sunne ko taiyaar hai
 The Hindu side will respond to the Muslim side For the last few days, the Muslim side was putting its arguments in the court
 pehle varishthawakil rajeev dhawan ne babari masjid ko lekar paksh rakhaa, iske baad minakshi aroda ne ASI report par bahes kii
 The Muslim side questioned the ASI report and demanded its investigation
 haalanki, supreme court ne kaha ki yahaan kisi ke paas asli saboot nahin hai, har koi ASI report ke aadhaar par hi tark rakh rahaa he
 Some important matter related to the case, Ayodhya case in the Supreme Court has been going on for the last 60 years but the decision has not yet come
 lekin is baar masale par nirnaayak sunwaayee ho rahi he
 Due to non-beneficial mode of arbitration earlier, daily hearing of this case started from 6 August
 abhi tak adaalat main hindu mahasabha, ramalala, nirmohi akhaada, sunni vakf board samet sabhi pakshakaar apni daleelein de chuke hai
 The case is being heard by a five-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi

 darasal, ye dulhan dharna dene apane sasuraal bharol gaanv ja rahi thi, kyonki iske sasuraal waalon ne ise apnaane se inkaar kar diya tha
 Actually, Preity was married to Dheeraj Thakur of Bharaul village in April last year
 vah sarkari skool main shikshak he
 Dheeraj's family refused to adopt Preity's love
 unka kahana he ki ladki ke parivaar ne jabardastee ye shaadi karwaai thi
 The family alleges that Dheeraj was abducted and forcibly married and therefore does not accept Preity
 lambey samay se jab sasuraal se or pati kii taraf se priti ko koi soochna nahin mili to usne makadampur jaakar jabardastee sasuraal main ghusane kaa faisla kiya
 On reaching there, the in-laws and husband did not allow her to enter, so she sat on the outside dharna
 priti ne kaha, 'main mar jaaoongi, lekin apane mata-pita ke ghar waapas nahin jaaoongi
 Hundreds of people had gathered outside the house to see this unique procession of the bride
 sthaneey police ne ghar ke baahar surakshabal kii tainaati bhi kar di, jo puure maamle main najar banaae hue the
 The local activist also tried to convince the girl's in-laws that there was no fault of the girl in this, but she did not agree
 gaanv waalon ke mutabik ladke ke parivaar ne priti ke pita ke khilaaf shikaayat bhi darj karwaai thi ki bete kii jabardastee shaadi karwaai gai thi
 At the same time, Preity's family alleges that Dheeraj's family asked for a dowry of five lakh rupees and many costly encounters, and refused to accept Preeti if she did not give dowry
 vahiin, priti kaa kahana he ki vah apni ladaai se peeche nahin hategi
 He has been sitting outside the house for over 48 hours

 Although Shatrughan Sinha has not yet responded to the road show route, Shatrughan Sinha has not yet reacted, but he too chose the same route when he went to nominate

 congress ne shanivaar ko mamata banerjee ke daawey par pratikriya vyakt karte hue kaha ki desh main madhyavadhi chunaav kii bilkul sambhaavna nahin he or sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) sarkaar apana doosraa kaarykaal puraa karegi
 Congress spokesperson Rashid Alvi said, 'I have not seen Banerjee's statement, but one thing is clear that the UPA government will complete its second term and elections will be held on schedule
 madhyavadhi chunaav kaa koi prashn nahin he, or dow
 The Manmohan Singhji-led government will complete its term
 main khaastaur se kah saktaa hum ki chunaav nirdhaarit samay par hi hoga
 Alvi's reaction comes at a time when Banerjee, while addressing party workers in Kolkata on Friday, said that she had received information that a certain political party had held an internal meeting in Delhi on the issue of holding the Lok Sabha elections in 2013
 is
 gauratlab he ki mamata banerjee ne apni party ke kaaryakartaaon se kaha ki unhen chunaav ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 Mamta Banerjee had said, 'I have received information that such a meeting has been held in Delhi
 philhal main yah nahin bataaungi ki kis party ne baithak kii thi
 The party wants to conduct the Lok Sabha elections in 2013 itself
 'mamata banerjee ne kaha tha, 'kisi bhi din hamen chunaav kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 So we should be ready to face it
 or ham aisa kuch na karen jisase log hamaare bare main galat samajhen

 What is the truth? India Today anti-fake News War Room found that this claim is completely false
 ye ghatana do saal puraani he or ye kashmir kii nahin balki haryana kii he
 This video has been present on social media since 2017, so it is clear that this video has nothing to do with the current incident in Kashmir
 video kii padtalpakistani mantri ali haidar jaidi ne jo video post kiya he wo kareeb 1 minute 53 second lanbaa he
 In this, policemen are lathicharge on men and women
 video main 1 minute 14 second par ek bachche ke saath ek jakhmi mahila dikh rahi he uske bagal main ek or bujurg mahila leti he

 co / zbn9wvwlmm— Kashyap Kadagattur 🇮🇳 (@iamkash_kr)august 19, 2019bengaluru main tainaat siarpief ke afasar kashyap kadagattur ne paak mantri ko jawaab main likhaa ki ye kashmir kaa video nahin he
 He claimed that the police action was against the followers of Dera Sacha Sauda in Haryana
 akhabaaron main chhapi khabar seiscand kii pushti hoti he
 In fact, when Baba Ram Rahim, the head of Dera Sacha Sauda, was convicted on charges of rape, his supporters created a furore in Panchkula, Haryana
 We found all the videos related to this incident on youtube "GSA Gallery" "NYOOOZ TV" in August 2017 Many more youtube channels had posted news of lathicharge on Dera supporters
 haalanki mahila ke rone kii aawaaj in video main nahin thi jisase saaf he ki video ke saath chhedchhad kii gai he
 The pictures of the video can be seen below
 The picture taken from the viral video can be seen at the beginning of the video of the youtube video of 2017
 a red car can be seen starting with the number CH which proves that this car belongs to Chandigarh
 haalanki sirf car ke aadhaar par lokation nahin bataai ja sakati phir bhi kai or aise saboot hai jo ye sabit karte hai ki video ram rahim samarthakon par hue lathicharge kaa hi he
 The second part of the viral part in the second part of the video has been taken from the injured woman, child and other woman from an old video which has nothing to do with this incident
 sthaneey telegu channel “CVR News” ortimes of indiyake mutabik telugana main ek sab inspector ne apni patni or saas ko peethta camere par pakadaa gaya tha jab use ye pataa chalaa ki uski patni ke kisi se avaidh sambandh hai 
 The conclusion is that the video posted by Pakistani Minister Ali Hyder Zaidi is not only false but it has been prepared by combining the two incidents and has nothing to do with Kashmir

 ) The BJP, which has been marginalized in UP politics during the last decade, has been given a lively rally by the party's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi's rally held on October 19 at Gautam Badh Park in Kanpur
 kanpur main modi ko sunne umadi kareeb teen lakh logon kii bheed ne bijepi netaaon ke bich modi naam kaa danka baja diya he
 This was the first time since the Ram Mandir movement that such a large crowd gathered at a BJP rally in UP
 modi ke saath manch main maujuud purv mukhyamantri or eta se nirdaleey saansad kalyaan singh, calraj mishra, omprakash singh ke saath bijepi ke raash treey adhyaksh rajnath singh ne bakhubi yah sandesh dene kii koshish kii ki upi main party ke bheetar kisi prakaar kaa antarvirodh nahin he or karyakartaon ke saatha party ke sabhi bade netaa narendra modi ko pradhanmantri banane kaa sankalp kar chuke hai
 At the Kanpur rally, the party leaders got an indication that the BJP has now left the era of atal-advani and has entered the Modi era
 desh kaa manchester kahi jane vaali kanpur nagari main modi kaa junun sir chadhqar bol rahaa tha
 When Modi stood up to speak, loud slogans of 'sher Aaya, Sher Aaya' started
 raily main yuvaaon kaa josh or ‘ modi-modi’ kii narebaaji itani hui ki kai baar modi ko apana bhaashan rokna padaa
 In fact, Modi's rally in Kanpur had become a question of prestige for the BJP
 raily sthal ko lekar jitarah se anischitata rahi usase party kaaphi ulajhn main thi
 The administration also clashed several times
 yahi nahin upi main modi ke chunavi aagaaj ko joardaar banane ke liye bijepi netaaon ne koi kasar nahin chodi thi
 It was also the examination of the BJP leaders of the state, in which at present they are seen to be upright
 haalanki musalamaanon main paith banane kii narendra modi kii koshishen abhi tak naakaam hi sabit hui hai
 Claims were also made to gather a large number of Muslims in Kanpur rally
 iske liye muslim bahulya ilaakon main baqayda ek - bocolate- banti gai thi jisamen gujarat main narendra modi dwaara musalamaanon kii behatari ke liye karaae gaye kaaryon kaa zikr tha baavjood iske kanpur kii raily main musalamaanon ke nazariye se party kaa ‘ bismillah’ behatar nahin rahaa
 The absence of Muslim faces among the masses gathered in Kanpur also gave birth to discussion
 kanpur kii is vishaal raily ne bijepi kii kamajoriyon ko bhi rekhaankit kar diya
 At the time of the Ram Mandir movement, while the party had a group of speakers at the local level who used to excite people with warm speeches, the BJP, which is constantly trying to make inroads among the youth, currently has such new youth among senior leaders
 There is no team of leaders who tie their speeches
 kanpur main modi ko sunne ke liye dopaher 11 baje se hi bheed raily sthal par pahunchane lagi thi or is bheed ko baandhe rakhane ke liye party ne filmi gane kii parody kaa sahaara liya jisamen modi kaa gungan or congress kii aalochana kii gai thi
 On the lines of the song 'achha Sila Diya Tune Mere Pyaar Ka', sung by Pakistani singer Ataullah Khan, the crowd cheered fiercely on the song 'cheat Gaya Sada Congress Aayi, Looted the Nation, Sonia Tai Ne'
 iske alaava ‘sadaa chuse khun garibon kaa, congress to dagaabaaz re’ jaise geeton ne kanpur raily ke shuru main samaa baandhne kii bharsak koshish kii

 "tejashwi said," Nitish Kumar will kill and ask to distract the attention of others, hey look Lalu Prasad is corrupt
 nitish kumaar, khud naitik / saamaajik or raajnneetik bhrashtachar ke bhishma pitamah hai
 Does he have a stand? Except Lalu Yadav, he has nothing to say? No more left! sarkaar ne mangalvaar ko ek baar phir spasht kar diya ki aatankwaad kaa koi rang, jati yaa dharm nahin hota, kanoon kii najar main sabhi log baraabar hai or koi kanoon kisi dharm ke khilaaf nahin hota he
 In reply to a supplementary question of Basudev Acharya, Yashwant Sinha, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Saugat Rai, Sharifuddin Shariq in the Lok Sabha, Minister of State for Home RPN Singh said that the law does not discriminate on the basis of religion and apart from the Malegaon scandal No such case has come to light in which a case has not been made against those taken into custody
 agar sadsy kisi aise maamle ko saamne laayenge jisamen kisi bekasoor vyakti ko pakadaa gaya ho, tab sarkaar nishchit taur par us par gaur karegi
 Singh said that under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), if a charge sheet is not filed against a person within 180 days, he will get bail
 is kanoon kii dhara 45 (2) ke tahat logon kii hiton kii raksha ko dhyaan main rakhte hue praavdhaan kiye gaye hai

 modi cabinet ne kii maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan kii anushansachunaav parinaamon ke baad rajya main nahin ho paa rahaa tha sarkaar gathanmaharashtra main satta kaa sangharsh ab samaapt ho chukaa he, rajya main raashtrapati shashan laga diya gaya he
 Even after the bjp-shiv Sena Mahayuti got a majority in the assembly elections, they got caught up in the formation of the government and both parties got separated
 iske baad rajya main kisi bhi dal ke paas bahumat na hone kii vajah se matganana (24 oktober) ke baad se ab tak rajya main sarkaar gathan nahin ho paaya tha
 Both BJP and Shiv Sena have been called by the Governor to form the government
 aaj ensipi kii baari thi
 But even before this, the Modi cabinet has decided on President's rule and sent the recommendation to the President
 jiske baad raashtrapati ramnath kovind ne bhi rajya main raashtrapati shashan ko manjuuri de di
 However, the formation of government in Maharashtra has not been closed since the imposition of President's rule
 raashtrapati shashan ke dauraan agar koi bhi party rajyapal ke paas jaati he or unhen vishwaas dilaane main kaamyaab rahati he ki unke paas bahumat ke liye paryaapt sankhya he
 In such a situation, the Governor is convinced that a government can be formed, in such a situation, he can recommend to end President's rule and invite him to form the government
 maharashtra kaa satta sangharsh aakhirkaar raashtrapati shashan par jaakar rukaa
 Here we are trying to explain to you, under what circumstances the President's rule takes place in any state and what are its provisions
 maharashtra kii baat karen to yahaan raashtrapati shashan isliye lagaaya gaya he kyonki chunaavon main kisi bhi dal yaa gathbandhan ke paas bahumat nahin he
 The provisions related to the constitutional system of President's rule are given in Article 356 of the Constitution
 artical 356 ke mutabik raashtrapati kisi bhi rajya main raashtrapati shashan laga sakate hai yadi ve is baat se santusht hon ki rajya sarkaar samvidhan ke vibhinn praavdhaanon ke mutabik kaam nahin kar rahi he
 It is not necessary that the President take this decision only on the basis of the report of the Governor of that state
 yah anuchhed ek saadhan he jo centre sarkaar ko kisi naagarik ashaanti jaise ki dange jinase nipatane main rajya sarkaar vifal rahi ho kii dasha main kisi rajya sarkaar par apana adhikaar sthapit karne main sakasham banaata he
 It is also mentioned in the Constitution that within two months of imposition of President's rule, it is necessary to ratify it by both the Houses of Parliament
 yadi is bich loksabhaa bhang ho jaati he to iskaa rajyasabha dwaara anumodan kiye jane ke baad nai loksabhaa dwaara apane gathan ke ek maheene ke bheetar anumodan kiya janaa jaruri he
 In the absence of majority, President's rule when no party or coalition has a clear majority in a House
 rajyapal sadan ko 6 maheene kii avadhi ke liye 'nilambit avasthaa' main rakh sakate hai
 After 6 months, re-election is held if no clear majority is obtained
 raashtrapati shashan kii avadhiyadi sansad ke donon sadanon dwaara raashtrapati shashan kaa anumodan kar diya jaataa he to raashtrapati shashan 6 maah tak chalata rahegaa
 In this way it can be carried forward for 3 years by doing 6-6 months
 kyon kehete hai raashtrapati shashanise raashtrapati shashan isliye kaha jaataa he kyonki, iske dwaara rajya kaa niyantran ek nirvaachit mukhyamantri kii jagah sidhe bharat ke raashtrapati ke adheen aa jaataa he
 But administratively, the Governor of the state is given executive powers by the central government
 prashasan main madad karne ke liye rajyapal salaahkaaron kii niyukti karata he, jo aam taur par sevanivrutt civil sevak hote hai
 Usually in this situation, the state follows the policies of the ruling party at the center
 kya hote hai badlaav- raashtrapati, mukhyamantri ke netritv vaali mantriparishad ko bhang kar dete hai
 - The President takes over the functions of the State Government and has the powers of the Governor and other executive officers
 - rajya kaa rajyapal, raashtrapati ke naam par rajya sachiv kii sahaayta se athwa raashtrapati dwaara niyukt kisi salaahkaar kii sahaayta se rajya kaa shashan chalaata he
 This is the reason why the declaration made under Article 356 is called President's rule
 - raashtrapati, ghoshnaa kar saktaa he ki rajya vidhayika kii shaktiyon kaa prayog sansad karegi
 - It is the Parliament that passes the state bill and the budget proposal
 - sansad ko yah adhikaar he ki vah rajya ke liye kanoon banane kii shakti raashtrapati athwa uske kisi namit adhikari ko de sakati he
 When the Parliament is not running, the President can issue an ordinance for the 'state governed by Article 356'

 This famine caused panic and turmoil all around
 dharm paksh ke yajna, havan, pindadaan, katha-vrath aadi main kami ho gai
 When trouble is there, where does the creature's interest remain in religious works
 praja ne raja ke paas jaakar apni samasya rakhi
 The king was already unhappy about this situation

 While wandering there, one day he reached the ashram of Brahma's son Angira Rishi and prostrated him
 rishiver ne jangal main or apane ashram main aane kaa kaaran jaananaa chaha
 Then the king folded his hands and said- 'mahatma! Even following religion in all ways, i am not able to see people happy in my state
 aakhir kis kaaran se aisa ho rahaa he, kripaya iskaa samaadhaan karen
 Hearing this, Maharishi Angira said- 'O Rajan! This is the best era of all ages
 isamen chote se paap kaa bhi bada bhayankar dand miltaa he
 In this, religion prevails in all four phases
 brahman ke atirikt kisi anya jati ko tap karne kaa adhikaar nahin he jabaki aapke rajya main ek shudra tapasya kar rahaa he

 They started thinking that what kind of sin have i committed, which i am getting punished in this way? Then, with the aim of finding some means to get rid of this suffering, the king took the army and went towards the forest
 vahaan ghoomte-ghoomte ek din ve brahmaji ke putr angira rishi ke ashram main pahunche or unhen sashtaang pranaam kiya
 Rishiwar sought to know the reason for coming to the forest and his ashram
 tab raja ne haath jodakar kaha- 'mahatman! sabhi prakaar se dharm kaa paalan karata hua bhi main apane rajya main praja ko sukhi nahin dekh paa rahaa hum
 After all, why is this happening, please resolve it
 yah sunakar maharishi angira ne kaha- 'he rajan! sab yugon se uttam yah satyuga he
 There is also a severe punishment for a minor sin

 shaadi, kisi ke bhi jivan kaa mahatvapurn faisla hota he
 If you also want to get married and for this your parents are looking for a girl, then keep some things in mind
 ek haalia adhyayan ke mutabik rishta dur tak chalegaa yaa jaldi hi tut jayega, iskaa andaja kaaphi had tak pehle lagaaya ja saktaa he
 You can guess this by looking at some of the habits of women
 aaiye jaanate hai ki kin chaar aadaton vaali mahilaon se shaadi nahin kerani chahie
 Age 29 is perfect for marriage, know why
 
 
 1
 Do not marry any girl who is in your relationship
 aage chalakar aise rishton main kai dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Conflicts arise due to getting gotra in front
 jaane, kis raashi ke ladke se shaadi nahin kerani chahie2
 It is wrong for a girl to be a bawli friend in today's age, that a girl should not make a friend or boyfriend before marriage
 par bwoyfriend agar bahut bavaali ho to shaadi ke baad bhi vah pareshaan kar saktaa he
 In such a situation, it would be better to know before marriage that he has no bawali friend or boyfriend
 
 
 
 So that the matter does not reach the divorce3

 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has expressed concern over the reduction in speedy trials in Bihar
 saal 2005 main jab nitish kumaar kii sarkaar satta main ai thi, us samay spidi trial ke jariye sarkaar ne rule of lau ko bihar main kaayam kiya tha
 But much has changed in these 12 years
 ab phir se kanoon vyavastha ko lekar sawaal uthne lage hai
 In such a situation, the reason behind this is being told that the speedy trial is lacking
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaarane effective investigeshan, spidi trial and timeli justise par yojit seminar main kaha ki bihar main rule of lau agar stablish hua to isamen sabase badi bhoomika nyaaypalika kii hogi
 He said that people's trust and confidence in the democratic system should be maintained
 iske liye legislator, judiciri or agjicutive body apni tarah se apni-apni jimmedaari par nirvahan karte hai, jisase yah sambhav hota he
 Nitish Kumar said that everyone knows the situation of Bihar at that time
 samay seemaa par trial nahin hota tha
 Criminals were left
 kanoon kaa dar nahin rahata tha
 We insisted on a trial in the earliest cases
 khaskar arms act par
 Because there were only two-three witnesses in it and most were official
 saal 2000 main jab rajya kaa bantwaaraa hua tha to hamaare kuch adhikari jharkhand main chale gaye
 Their cadre changed
 'maine kaha ki jitne bhi vitnesh adhikari hai, unki suchi apadet kii jaae
 After this, its effective results came out
 trial teji se hua or samay seemaa ke andar sajaa mili
 Routine trials also gained momentum
 'saal 2006 main kul canvicts kii sankhya 6,839, saal 2007 main 9,853, saal 2008 main 12,007, saal 2009 main 13,146 or saal 2010 main 14,311 rahi, jo shuru main badhate kram ko darsha rahaa he
 But later this number started to decrease and in the year 2016 its number decreased to just 5,508
 aankadon se saaf he ki saal 2006 se 2010 tak bihar main kanoon kaa raaj sthapit karne ke liye kitni mehnat kii gai
 Its effect was also visible at that time
 nitish kumaraka wo pehla turm tha or logon ko lagane laga tha ki bihar main ab kanoon kaa raaj sthapit ho gaya
 But in the second term, there was a decline in speedy trials or punishment for the culprits
 2010 mennithish kumaror bijepi ne vidhansabha main prachand jeet hasil kii thi or yah prachand jeet ne hi ek tarah se bihar main aparaadhiyon ke khilaaf ho rahi gambhir karrwai ko kamjor kar diya
 Then Nitish Kumar split from BJP in 2013
 saal 2015 lalu prasad yadav ke saath milakar chunaav jite or ab phir se bijepi ke saath bihar main sarkaar he

 Explain that Tamil Rockers is a website notorious for piracy and it releases pirated copies of newly released films on its website
 ye website ab tak naa jane kitni badi filmon ko relies ke thik baad pyret kar chuki he
 One major disadvantage of this is that the production house and the entire film crew start going to loss because after seeing the pirated copy, people do not go to see the film in theaters nor buy original dvds
 july main relies hui vijay devraconda kii khaas film dear commered ko bhi is website ne relies ke thik baad li kar diya tha
 After this, Shahid Kapoor starrer film Kabir Singh was also leaked by the same pirated website

 Whereas all Muslims should become terrorists and accused the media of showing their statements in half and inaccurate context, taking the media into the dock on allegations of not condemning Osama bin Laden

 fidain or aatanki hamalon par lambii takreer dene vaale dharmaguru ne bhartiya musalamaanon kii shiksha or unki samasyaon se jude sawaalon par chuppi saadh lee

 To show himself against terror, the doctor condemned the terrorist organization Islami State, saying that it is anti-islamic, not Islamic
 lekin bharat main jammu kashmir ke aatankiyon par golmol jawaab diya

 On the question of underestimating Rajnath Singh as compared to Shah, the media works to undermine or focus on Raikissi - Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister for the first time as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief of the Defense Minister Rajnath Singh
 rajnath singh kii aguwai main bijepi pehali baar centre main purna bahumat se sarkaar banane main safal rahi, lekin amit shah ko 'chanakya' kaha jaataa he jabaki rajnath singh is tamge se vanchit rah gaye
 Why did this happen? Writers writing the biographies of Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh on Sunday on the stage of Sahitya Aaj Tak shared this secret
 'raajnneetih e biography of rajnath singh' ke lekhak gautam chintamani ne amit shah ke mukaable rajnath singh ko kam aankane ke sawaal par bebaaki se raay rakhi
 Amit Shah suddenly came to be called 'chanakya' but Narendra Modi became Prime Minister when Rajnath Singh was the BJP chief, but he is not called 'chanakya'
 is sawaal par gautam chintaa mani kehete hai ki sabko pataa he ki bijepi cader aadhaarit party he
 No one is aware of who is going to be the next party president here
 sahitya ajtak main registration ke liye yahaan clic karengautam chintamani ne kaha kibijepike jo bade netaa hai unhone bada kaam kiya he, jis par kitaab likhi ja sakati he
 i do not think that Rajnath Singh was underestimated
 is tarah kaa paracepshan media ne paidaa kiya he
 The public gives these tags
 abhi amit shah jis sthiti main dikh rahe hai wo kai saalon kii mehnat he
 Seeing someone less or focusing on someone is because of us
 rajnath singh se jude 'kadi ninda' par kya bole lekhakaunhone kaha ki jan netaa kaa logon ke saath judane kaa apana andaaj hota he
 People ask me many kinds of questions about Rajnath Singh

 i want to explain what the leader says and what he does is important
 abhi ham yahaan narendra modi or amit shah kii baat kar rahe hai lekin asli baat ye he ki ye sabhi log shyama prasad mukherjee se prabhavit hai or kaam kar rahe hai
 But no one knows Shyama Prasad Mukherjee
 bahut kam aise netaa hai jinaki jeevani se bharat ke bare main pataa chalata he
 While studying the life of Rajnath Singh, i found that this is not just a story of leaders, but it is a story of a period
 sahitya ajtak kii puri kawarej yahaan dekhenraajnneeti main andarkhaane kya chalata he or netaa ek duusare kaa kaise pair khinchate hai is par kitna eemaandaaree se likhaa gaya? amit shah kii biography likhane vaale dow
 Anirban Ganguly said that who is Chanakya and who is not, this is a raised issue of media
 amit shah ne gujarat main sabit kiya, party satta main bani hui he
 Proven over the years, it was Rajnath Singh who later appointed Amit Shah as the General Secretary of Uttar Pradesh
 yahaan na koi achaanak (chanakya bana he) he or na hi koi kamatar he

 ' When millions of young people are reaching the age of becoming voters for the first time, then they face two to three types of system
 ek license banaate vakt, doosraa dasvin or barahavin ke imtahaan ke vakt
 How bad the experiences of making a license by bribing or leaking a paper in examination, passing money would have affected them
 jis system par pehle din se bharosa bananaa chahie, uske saath in yuvaaon ke rishte kii shuruyaat avishvaas se hoti he
 When he had this experience during the examination of medical and engineering, then his confidence would be deepened that if something is to be made in this country then this is the way
 ho saktaa he yahi hataasha kaa ek kaaran bhi ho
 Therefore, we must demand that the examination system in India is such that no one can make a dent
 har saal board ke imtahaan hote hai
 Various types of news are published in the media
 ek rajya ko lekar zyaada charchaa hoti he, baaki kii nahin isliye agar aap sabhi rajyon kii khabaron ko nikaal kar denkhen to zyaada badi samasya kaa darshan karte hai
 The image of the Indian examination system that is created by these reports is not good
 maharashtra, kerala, bengal, madhya pradesh rajasthan, bihar, himachal pradesh,haryana, tamilnadu, urisa or jammu-kashmir kii khabaren bataati hai ki parche li hote hai, li hone kii afvaah bhi udati he or imtahaan radd hote hai
 In March this year, when the board was examining in Maharashtra, the newspapers were writing that the question paper had been leaked for the third consecutive year
 marathi kaa prashn patr li ho gaya
 As of March 14, 2017, India Today reported that the Math Form of 12th was leaked on a mobile phone
 hindustan times ne to hedline banaai he ki echechasi kii pariksha ke paanch dinon main paanch parche li ho gaye
 The Indian Express dated 16 March 2017 reported from Shimla that the Himachal Board has canceled the papers of Physics and Computer Science of class 12 due to reports of paper leaks
 mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ko vidhansabha main prashn patron kii chori par bayaan dena padaa

 In Orissa, the students locked the teacher in the room for not copying
 jammu-kashmir main is saal farvari main 10veen kii science pariksha main nakal kii itani khabar ai ki kuch kendron par radd kerani pad gai
 This year, when the officials were upset with the news of the form being leaked on the first day of the twelfth exam in Rajasthan, it was later learned that it was rumored
 2015 main tamilnadu main ganit kaa parchaa li ho gaya, chaar shikshak bhi giraftaar kiye gaye
 Officials accepted the leak of the physical science paper in the secondary examination in March this year in Bengal
 telegraph ne likhaa he ki adhikari kehete hai ki parchaa li nahin hua he magar whats par jo prashn patr gum rahaa he wo physical science kaa hi prashn patr he

 In Madhya Pradesh, the paper of Chemistry and Physics was also rumored to be on Whats Up

 If paper leakage is a pan-india problem, then every state should be guaranteed to remove it
 eemaandaar pariksha pranali ke bagair eemaandaar vyavastha kii samskruti ban hi nahin sakati he
 i am not saying that the news of the leaks has been published in the newspapers, they are all right, may or may not happen, but the return of these reports every year suggests that the gangs who steal are around the examination centers
 har imtahaan ke baad chaatro kaa samooh do virgon main bant jaataa he
 One who did not copy, the other who copied
 nakal karne waalon ko smart samajhane kii parampara par roak lagani chahie
 After the tenth and twelfth exams Medilak sat looking at the news of the entrance examination, the situation looked equally terrible
 medical kii taiyaari karne vaale chaatr apni haddi galaa dete hai, maa baap kaa kitna paisa karch hota he, or jab inhen pataa chalata hoga ki neet kii pariksha main dhaandhlee hui he, to wo khud ko kitna asahaay pate honge
 If a student also gets admission through Vyapam, then it is unfair to have hundreds of honest students
 ham kaise in khabaron ko lekar saamaanya ho sakate hai
 Every year when 19-20 year old boys are found wandering outside the media house of Delhi with complaints of theft and rigging, they are sad to see them
 ham kyon nahin sarkaar se ek phul pruf pariksha pranali kii maang kar sakate hai
 How would you explain to an honest student that someone became a doctor by paying money? phir compatishan kaa kya matlab he
 After these reports, action was taken against any officer related to NEET examination
 isaki koi khabar hamaare haath nahin lagi
 After collecting these headlines in different newspapers, it is found that there is a possibility of break in the medical entrance examination
 shaatir logon ke giroh har saal aate hai or kisi mehnatee chaatr kaa haq uda le jate hai
 Can we not have an honest and reliable examination system in which not a single student is cheated? 26 july ke akhabaaron main ek khabar chhapi, National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) kii post graduate pariksha yojit karne ke liye jis amareeki company ko theka diya gaya he, usne mana he ki pariksha ke system ko koi hack kar saktaa he
 Would it be right to ask the government the question that when India can simultaneously send 108 satellites into space, then it cannot conduct medical entrance examination itself
 kya parikshaayen bhi privet agenciyon se hone lagi hai
 Then who will be responsible for the leak, how will there be confidence that the private company will not deal with anyone
 dilli police krime branch central range kii chargeshit se pataa chalata he ki dilli police ne chandigarh or noida centre kii jaanch kii, acchhee jaanch kii he, magar isi tarah kii jaanch agar desh bhar main ho jaati to jane kitne bharam tuutate or kitna bharosa
 First, understand the system of NEET exam
 neshnal igzamination board neet kii pariksha yojit karata he
 Undergraduate and post graduate exams are under NEET
 under graduate neet pariksha main 10-11 lakh chaatr shaamil hote hai
 The Post Graduate NEET Exam consists of close to three lakh students
 ye teen lakh wo chaatr hai jo paanch saal kii medical padhai pard chuke hote hai
 There are about 25000 seats for PG, out of which only eleven thousand are government
 privet kalejon se piji karnaa karodon kaa khel he isliye har doctor sarkari seat ke liye taiyaari karata he
 Out of 10-11000 PG seats in the government, only 6-7000 are clinical, ie in which you can practice
 ek ek seat ke liye maaramaari hoti he
 The doctor starts preparing for PG from the very first year i
e
 after taking admission in the medical college
 jab use yah pataa chale ki isamen bhi kuch log agent sab agent ke zariye unki mehnat par daaka daal rahe hai to ve kitne hataash hote honge
 On the complaint of rigging in PG NEET examination held in December 2016, Delhi Police started investigation, many such things have come to the fore
 piji neet kii pariksha kaa theka america kii ek company prometric ko diya gaya
 This company has told the police that its software may be tampered with
 police jaanch kar rahi thi ki pariksha kaa software hack ho saktaa he yaa nahin
 The 20-page charge sheet has dangerous stories ranging from hacking to fixing
 chargeshit he, dosha sabit nahin hua he
 We are trying to understand the examination system under the pretext of this charge sheet
 dilli police par zimmedaari hogi ki wo is chargeshit ko sabit bhi kare
 Police came to know that the accused had planned the hacking plan long before the examination began
 chaatro se paise lekar unhen yah bhi kaha gaya ki kis centre kaa chunaav karen, uske aage kaa ve log dekh lenge
 The Delhi Police has also arrested four people in this regard
 dilli police ne chaar logon ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 Two supervisors from examination centers in Chandigarh and Noida have helped some students
 jis sarwar se pariksha ho rahi thi, use hack kar inaki madad kii gai
 During interrogation, the police found out that Prometric Testings Pvt Ltd had been awarded the contract for the examination
 chargeshit ke anusaar is company ne CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd ke saath qaraar kiya ki wo ejeeniyar or site suparviser or anya staff uplabdh karaae taaki agzaam lab taiyaar ho sake
 CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd has tied up with m / s Apex Services to arrange for the need of technical staff in the examination centers
 police kaa maananaa he ki itani kadi banati chali gai ki kai agent or sab agent is system main paidaa ho gaye jo chaatro ko khojane lage ki paise mil jaae to use acha rank de diya jaae
 The first step is to meet the candidate
 ummidavaar milte hi The sub agent used to tell his senior agent
 senior agent mata pita yaa chaatr ke sampark main aa jaataa he
 These agents keep in touch with the site's supervisor, the engineer
 ummidavaar ko bataaya jaataa he ki koun sa pariksha centre chune
 Where the authorities can help him in counterfeiting
 pariksha yojit karne vaali company police ko us software ke bare main nahin bataa saki jiske sahare pariksha ko hack kiya gaya he
 The student who gave the money was given access to the exam computer through the Internet and the exam hall was connected to the outside computer
 ye to post graduate pariksha kaa haal he kareeb teen lakh ke kareeb chaatr hissaa lete hai
 According to an Indian Express news, some 200 students are expected to pass through this route
 jis pariksha pranali par lakhon chaatro or unke pariwaron par itnaa bharosa he wo bharosa tutaa kaise
 Because of which
 is maamle ko uthaane vaale anand raay kaa daawa he ki amareeki company ko bina tender ke hi pariksha yojit karne kaa theka de diya gaya
 Anand Rai has been raising this issue for two consecutive years
 is baar jab embibies ke liye neet kii pariksha ke liye chaatr chatraayen pariksha kender pahunte to unki sakhti se jaanch kii gai
 The investigation took place after removing the clothes
 kapade katar diye gaye
 There is an incident in Kerala but there is no theft, no one can copy it, for this, there was such a check that everyone must have felt that they will not be cheated
 ab nakal khatm
 The dress code has been issued as to how to reach the examination center
 kerala ke kannur main thodaa zyaada ho gaya magar chaatro ko ek aisi pariksha pranali kaa intazaar to he hi jis par aankh moond kar bharosa kiya ja sake
 You have seen the condition of NEET PG, now see the condition of NEET undergraduate exam in newspaper news
 patna police sibiesai kii anumati kaa intazaar kar rahi he taaki jis trunk main prashn patr laae gaye unki forencik jaanch ho sake
 On May 7, NEET examination was conducted on 32 of Patna and 20 of Gaya
 police kaa daawa he ki usne prashn patr li karne kii koshish ko naakaam kar diya
 Many people were arrested in this connection
 aap 41 may 2017 kaa times of india dekh sakate hai
 a day before in Patna's Dainik Jagran, news appears on the page that a deal of three crores was made with the kingpin to pass the exam
 ek khabar ke hedline main kaha gaya he ki paanch giroh hai jo 20 lakh main paas karaane kii guarantee lete hai
 There have also been reports from many places that by taking money, the centers duped many candidates by providing answers to 120 questions instead of 145
 is saal may main yojit neet yuji pariksha kii jaanch goa police kar rahi he, rajasthan kii aties kar rahi he or patna police kar rahi he
 When Anand Rai complained to the Delhi Police, he got a verbal reply that Neet is so busy with the investigation of PG that it is not possible to pay much attention to the investigation of Neet UG
 neet embibies or neet piji kii pariksha vyavastha puri tarah chori mukt nahin he
 The system should be such that there is no chance of rumor and no one can cheat anyone
 akhabaaron kii cliping dekhte hue lag rahaa tha ki har rajya main is pariksha ko lekar girohon kaa apana system he
 This is when Vyapam scam happened in a similar manner
 yahaan tak ki ames kii pravesh pariksha bhi sandigdh ho jaati he
 On June 15, the CBI registered a case on AIIMS MBBS for leaking the question paper
 28 may ko pariksha hui thi
 The Delhi High Court had sought a status report in the case of AIIMS paper leak to the Central Government, AIIMS and CBI
 anand raay is maamle main yachika karta hai or prashanth bhushan vakil hai
 The next hearing is on August 16
 sibiai ne kai jagahon par chhapemari bhi kii he
 In 2003, a big scam came out regarding AIIMS examination
 mukhya aaropee ranjit don kaa naam yaad hoga jo bank, ejineering, medical ke prashn patr li karata tha
 Many older people were his clients, who wanted to engineer their children on the basis of money
 sibiai kii jaanch hui thi
 It was a business of 100 crores
 2003 ke baad 2017 main sibiai phir ames pariksha kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The comments mujhe pataa he ki ye sawaal netaaon ke bekaar ke aarope pratyarope jitne mahatvapurn nahin hai lekin sochiye ki paisa dekar bina padhai ke koi doctor ban jaae or aapkaa ilaaj karne lage
 It is not just about becoming a doctor, the government has spent public money on a student who has become a doctor by way of theft by giving money
 ek baar wo chori ke raste se doctor banegaa to doctorl kii naitikta kaa paalan kaise karegaa
 Vyapam scam was not properly debated in this country for political reasons but should have taken place
 supreme court ne sibiai se kaha he ki jaldi se sabhi maamalon main chargeshit file kiijie or hard discs kii report bhopal ke sibiai trial court main jamaa kiijie
 Till 31 October, the CBI has been asked to file a chargesheet in all the cases
 vyapam maamle main 200 se adhik exiaar darj he
 Anand Rai says that 2500 accused were made
 2000 giraftaar bhi hue the
 Vyapam's Bhanda broke out, but it should not happen that such a scam is happening about Neet
 hindu akhbaar kii report he 4 april 2017 kii
 a report of CAG was kept in Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly
 isamen kaha gaya ki rajya sarkaar ne parikshaon ke liye uchit regulatory fremawork rakhaa hi nahin jisaki vajah se ummidavaaron kaa bhavishya kharaab hua
 Vyapam is a department, not a regulatory body
 niyamon ko taak par rakhkar afasaron kii niyuktiyaan kii gayi
 The government also did not keep data on how many examinations have taken place
 pataa chalata he ki paardarshita kii ghor kami he
 The board has exams every year
 media main tarah tarah kii khabaren chhapati hai
 There is more discussion about one state and not the rest, so if you take out the news of all the states, then you see a bigger problem
 in khabaron se bhartiya pariksha pranali kii jo chhavi banati he wo acchhee nahin he
 Reports from Maharashtra, Kerala, Bengal, Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Odisha and Jammu and Kashmir state that leaflets are leaked, rumors of them leaking also fly and examinations are canceled
 isi saal march main maharashtra main jab board imtahaan ho rahe the to akhbaar likh rahe the ki lagaataar tisare varsh prashn patr li hua he
 Marathi question paper leaked
 14 march 2017 ke hi india today par khabar he ki mobile phone par 12veen kaa ganit kaa parchaa li ho gaya
 Hindustan Times has made a headline that five leaflets were leaked in five days of HHC examination
 16 march 2017 ke indian express main shimla se khabar chhapi he ki paper li kii khabaron ke kaaran himachal board ne 12veen ke physics, computer science ke paper radd kar diye hai
 Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh had to give a statement on the theft of question papers in the assembly
 sadan ko bataaya he ki ek skool kaa dabl lock todaa gaya or har vishay ke 60 prashn patr gaayab paae gaye
 In 2015, the entire nation was shocked by this photo copied in Vidya Niketan, Vaishali district of Bihar
 bihar board kii topper ne vishay ko jhakzor diya tha
 The controversy in Bihar's examination was also in 2016
 urisa main nakal na karne dene par chaatro ne teacher ko hi kamare main band kar diya
 In Jammu and Kashmir, in February this year, there was so much news of cheating in the science examination of class 10 that some centers had to be canceled
 is saal jab rajasthan main barahavin pariksha ke pehle din hi parchaa li hone kii khabaron se adhikari pareshaan ho gaye, baad main pataa chalaa ki afvaah thi
 In 2015, the form of mathematics was leaked in Tamil Nadu, four teachers were also arrested
 bengal main isi saal march kii madhyamik pariksha main physical science kaa parchaa li hone kii baat adhikariyon ne maan lee
 The Telegraph has written that the officials say that the form has not been leaked but the question paper which is circulating on Whats is the question paper of Physical Science
 april 2017 main dasvin class kaa ganit kaa paper out ho gaya
 The examination was canceled and orders for investigation were given
 madhyapradesh main chemistry or physics kaa parchaa bhi whats ap par aane kii afvaah udi thi
 Tell this is the condition of the board examinations of eleven states
 agar paper li hona akhil bhartiya samasya he to ise dur karne kii guarantee har rajya ko deni chahie
 a culture of honest system cannot exist without an honest examination system
 main nahin kah rahaa ki akhbaar main li hone kii khabar chhapi he wo sabhi sahi hai, ho saktaa he na ho lekin har saal in khabaron kaa laut aana bataata he ki chori karaane vaale giroh pariksha kendron ke aasapaas hi rahete hai
 After each examination, the group of students is divided into two classes
 ek jisane nakal nahin kii, doosraa jisane nakal kii
 The tradition of being considered smart by imitators should stop
 dasvin or barahavin kii pariksha ke baad medilak pravesh pariksha kii khabaron ko khangaalane baitha to sthiti utani hi bhayanak nazar ain
 The students preparing for medicine strangulate their bones, how much money the parents spend, and how helpless they will find themselves when they know that NEET has been rigged
 agar ek chaatr bhi vyapam ke tareeke se admician paa jaae to yah sainkadon eemaandaar chaatro ke saath ninsaphi he
 How can we be normal about these news stories? har saal jab 19-20 saal ke ladke chori or dhaandhlee kii shikaayat lekar dilli ke media house ke baahar bhatakate milte hai to unhen dekhakar dukh hota he
 Why can't we demand a full proof examination system from the government
 ek eemaandaar chaatr ko aap kaise samajhaayenge ki paisa dekar koi doctor ban gaya
 Then what is the meaning of competition? kya in khabaron ke baad neet pariksha se jude kisi adhikari ke khilaaf karrwai hui
 We did not get any news about it
 alag-alag akhabaaron ke ye hedline ek jagah jamaa kar dekhne par pataa chalata he ki medical pravesh pariksha main send kii guzaaish lagati he
 Gangs of vicious people come every year and take away the rights of any hardworking student
 kya hamen ek eemaandaar or bharosemand pariksha pranali nahin mil sakati jisamen ek bhi chaatr ke saath dhokhaa na ho
 The US company, which has been contracted to conduct the post-graduate examination of the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET), appeared in a news paper on 26 July, believed that one could hack the exam system
 kya sarkaar se yah sawaal poochna thik hoga ki jab bharat ek saath 108 upgrah antariksh main bhej saktaa he to kya medical pravesh pariksha khud yojit nahin kar saktaa he
 Are the examinations also started from private agencies? phir li hone kii javabdehi kiski hogi, kaise bharosa paidaa hoga ki privet company ne kisi ke saath sauda nahin kiya hoga
 The charge sheet of the Delhi Police Crime Branch Central Range shows that the Delhi Police has investigated Chandigarh and Noida Center, have done a good investigation, but if a similar investigation was conducted across the country, then how much would have broken and how much trust
 pehle neet pariksha ke system ko samajhiye
 The National Examination Board conducts the examination of NEET
 under graduate or post graduate kii pariksha neet ke tahat hoti he
 Undergraduate NEET exam consists of 10-11 lakh students
 post graduate neet pariksha main teen lakh ke kareeb chaatr shaamil hote hai
 These are the three lakh students who have studied five years of medical education
 piji ke liye kareeb 25000 seat hoti hai jinamein se das gyaarah hazaar hi sarkari hote hai
 Doing PG from private colleges is a game of crores, so every doctor prepares for the government seat
 sarkaar kii 10-11000 piji seat main se 6-7000 hi clinical hoti he yani jisamen aap practice kar sakate hai
 There is a fight for each seat
 doctor medical kalege main admician lete hi yani pehle hi saal se pi ji kii taiyaari shuru kar detaa he
 When he comes to know that some people in this too, agents are trying to rob him of his hard work through all agents, then how desperate they must be
 disambar 2016 main hui pi ji neet kii pariksha main dhaandhlee kii shikaayat par dilli police ne jaanch shuru kii to kai aisi baaten saamne ai hai jo hairaan karne vaali hai
 The contract for PG NEET was awarded to Prometric, a US company
 is company ne police ko bataaya he ki uske software se chhedchhad ho sakati he
 The police were investigating whether the exam software could be hacked
 20 panne kii chargeshit main hanking se lekar phixing ke khataranaak kisse hai
 There is a charge sheet, the defect has not been proved
 ham is chargeshit ke bahaane pariksha pranali ko samajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 It will be the responsibility of Delhi Police to prove this charge sheet as well
 police ko pataa chalaa ki aropiyon ne hekking kii yojana imtahaan shuru hone se bahut pehle bana lee thi
 Taking money from the students, they were also told that they will see the center next to which center to choose
 is sambandh main dilli police ne chaar logon ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 Delhi Police has also arrested four people
 chandigarh or noida ke pariksha kendron ke do suparviser ne kuch chaatro kii madad kii he
 The server through which the examination was being conducted was hacked and helped
 poochtacha ke dauraan police ko pataa laga ki pariksha ke liye Prometric Testings Pvt Ltd ko theka diya gaya he
 According to the chargesheet, the company signed an agreement with CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd to provide engineers and site supervisors and other staff to prepare the exam lab
 CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd ne m / s Apex Services ke saath qaraar kiya ki pariksha kendaron main technical staff kii zarurat padegi uski vyavastha kare
 Police believe that the link has become so strong that many agents and sub-agents have been born in this system, who start searching for the students that if they get the money then they should be given a good rank
 pehla charan he ummidavaar kaa milanaa
 As soon as the candidate meets sab agent apane senior agent ko bataa detaa tha
 The senior agent gets in touch with the parent or student
 ye agent site ke suparviser, inzenier ke sampark main rahete hai
 The candidate is told to choose which examination center
 jahaan adhikari use nakal karne main madad sakate hai
 The company conducting the exam could not tell the police about the software with which the exam has been hacked
 paise dene vaale chaatr ko internet ke zariye agzaam computer kaa acces de diya gaya or agzaam haal se baahar ke computer se jod diya gaya
 This is the condition of post graduate examination, about three lakh students take part
 indian express kii ek khabar ke mutabik is raste se koi 200 chaatro ke paas hone kii ashanka he
 How the trust that broke the test system that millions of students and their families have so much confidence in
 kiski vajah se
 Anand Rai, who took up the case, claims that the American company was given the contract to conduct the examination without tender
 anand raay hi lagaataar do teen saal se yah maamla uthaa rahe hai
 This time when the students reached the examination center for NEET exams for MBBS, they were strictly examined
 kapade utaravakar jaanch hui
 Clothes were given to Qatar
 kerala kii ghatana he magar chori na ho, koi nakal na kar sake iske liye aisi checking hui ki vaaki sabko laga hoga ki unke saath dhokhaa nahin hoga
 Now copying is over
 baqayda dress code jari hua ki pariksha kender par kaise pahunchnaa he
 Kannur in Kerala is a bit much, but the students are waiting for an exam system that can be trusted blindly
 neet piji kaa haal to dekh liya aapane, ab akhabaaron kii khabaron main neet under grugeet pariksha kaa haal dekhiye
 Patna Police is waiting for the permission of CBSE so that the trunk in which the question papers were brought can be forensic examined
 7 may ko patna ke 32 or gaya ke 20 par neet kii pariksha yojit kii gai thi
 Police claim that he foiled an attempt to leak the question paper
 is silsile main kai logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 You can see the Times of India of 41 May 2017
 patna ke dainik jaagran main ek din pehle panne par khabar chhapati he ki sargana se teen karod kii deal hui thi pariksha paas karaane ke liye
 a news headline states that there are five gangs who take a guarantee of passing in 20 lakhs
 kai jagah se aisi bhi khabaren chhapi hai ki paisa lekar centaron ne thaga kai abhyarthiyon ko, 145 kii jagah 120 prashnon ke hi uttar uplabdh karaae
 The Goa Police is investigating the NEET UG examination conducted in May this year, the ATS of Rajasthan and the Patna Police
 anand raay ne jab dilli police ko shikaayat kii to maukhik jawaab mila ki abhi neet pi ji kii jaanch main hi itnaa vyast hai ki neet yuji kii jaanch main utana dhyaan dena sambhav nahin he
 The examination system of NEET MBBS and NEET PG is not completely theft free
 system aisa hona chahie ki afvaah kii bhi guzaaish na rahe or koi kisi ko thag nahin paae
 Seeing the clipping of newspapers, it seemed that gangs have their own system in this state for this test
 ye tab he jab isi tarah se vyapam ghotaalaa hua tha
 Even AIIMS entrance examination becomes suspicious
 isi 15 june ko sibiai ne ames embibies kaa prashn patr li hone ke aarope main maamla darj kiya he
 The examination took place on 28 May
 dilli hai court ne centre sarkaar, ames or sibiai ko ames paper li ke maamle main states report maangi thi
 Anand Rai is the petitioner in this case and Prashant Bhushan is the lawyer
 16 agast ko agali sunwaayee he
 The CBI has also conducted raids at many places
 2003 main ames kii pariksha ko lekar bada ghotaalaa saamne aayaa tha
 The main accused Ranjit Dawn will remember the name which leaked the question papers of Bank, Engineering, Medical
 kai bade log uske client hote the jo apane bacchon ko paise ke dam par doctor ejeeniyar bana dena chaahate the
 The CBI was investigated
 100 karod kaa dhandha tha yah
 After 2003, CBI is again examining the AIIMS examination in 2017
 tippaniyan i know that these questions are not as important as the false accusations of politicians, but think that by paying money, become a doctor without studying and start treating you
 baat sirf doctor banane kaa nahin he, sarkaar ne janata kaa paisa ek aise chaatr par kharch kiya jo paise dekar chori ke raste se doctor bana he
 Once he becomes a doctor by way of theft, how will he follow the morality of the doctor
 is desh main raajnneetik kaarnon se vyapam ghotaale par thik se bahes nahin hui lekin honi chahie thi
 The Supreme Court has asked the CBI to quickly file the charge sheet in all cases and submit the hard disk report to the CBI Trial Court of Bhopal
 31 oktober tak sibiai se kaha gaya he ki sabhi cese main chargeshit file kerani he
 More than 200 firs have been registered in Vyapam case
 anand raay kaa kahana he ki 2500 aaropee banaae gaye the
 2000 were also arrested
 vyapam kaa bhanda to foot gaya magar kahin aisa na ho ki neet ko lekar bhi is tarah kaa ghotaalaa ho rahaa ho
 The Hindu newspaper reported 4 April 2017
 madhyapradesh vidhaan sabha main sieji kii ek report rakhi gai
 It said that the state government had not kept proper regulatory framework for the examinations, due to which the future of the candidates was spoiled
 vyapam ek vibhaag he,niamak sanstha nahin he
 Officers were appointed keeping rules in mind
 sarkaar ne ye bhi data nahin rakhaa kitni parikshaayen hui hai
 There is a great lack of transparency
 maharashtra, kerala, bengal, madhya pradesh rajasthan, bihar, himachal pradesh,haryana, tamilnadu, urisa or jammu-kashmir kii khabaren bataati hai ki parche li hote hai, li hone kii afvaah bhi udati he or imtahaan radd hote hai
 In March this year, when the board was examining in Maharashtra, the newspapers were writing that the question paper had been leaked for the third consecutive year
 marathi kaa prashn patr li ho gaya
 As of March 14, 2017, India Today reported that the Math Form of 12th was leaked on a mobile phone
 hindustan times ne to hedline banaai he ki echechasi kii pariksha ke paanch dinon main paanch parche li ho gaye
 The Indian Express dated 16 March 2017 reported from Shimla that the Himachal Board has canceled the papers of Physics and Computer Science of class 12 due to reports of paper leaks
 mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ko vidhansabha main prashn patron kii chori par bayaan dena padaa
 The House has been told that the double lock of a school was broken and 60 question papers of each subject were found missing
 2015 main bihar ke vaishali zile vidya niketan main nakal kii is tasviir se puraa desh sadame main aa gaya tha
 Topper of Bihar Board had pushed the subject
 bihar kii pariksha main vivaad 2016 main bhi rahaa
 In Orissa, the students locked the teacher in the room for not copying
 jammu-kashmir main is saal farvari main 10veen kii science pariksha main nakal kii itani khabar ai ki kuch kendron par radd kerani pad gai
 This year, when the officials were upset with the news of the form being leaked on the first day of the twelfth exam in Rajasthan, it was later learned that it was rumored
 2015 main tamilnadu main ganit kaa parchaa li ho gaya, chaar shikshak bhi giraftaar kiye gaye
 Officials accepted the leak of the physical science paper in the secondary examination in March this year in Bengal
 telegraph ne likhaa he ki adhikari kehete hai ki parchaa li nahin hua he magar whats par jo prashn patr gum rahaa he wo physical science kaa hi prashn patr he
 Mathematics paper of class x was out in April 2017
 pariksha radd hui or jaanch ke aadesh die gaye
 In Madhya Pradesh, the paper of Chemistry and Physics was also rumored to be on Whats Up
 bataaiye gyaarah rajyon kii board parikshaon kaa ye haal he
 If paper leakage is a pan-india problem, then every state should be guaranteed to remove it
 eemaandaar pariksha pranali ke bagair eemaandaar vyavastha kii samskruti ban hi nahin sakati he
 i am not saying that the news of the leaks has been published in the newspapers, they are all right, may or may not happen, but the return of these reports every year suggests that the gangs who steal are around the examination centers
 har imtahaan ke baad chaatro kaa samooh do virgon main bant jaataa he
 One who did not copy, the other who copied
 nakal karne waalon ko smart samajhane kii parampara par roak lagani chahie
 After the tenth and twelfth exams Medilak sat looking at the news of the entrance examination, the situation looked equally terrible
 medical kii taiyaari karne vaale chaatr apni haddi galaa dete hai, maa baap kaa kitna paisa karch hota he, or jab inhen pataa chalata hoga ki neet kii pariksha main dhaandhlee hui he, to wo khud ko kitna asahaay pate honge
 If a student also gets admission through Vyapam, then it is unfair to have hundreds of honest students
 ham kaise in khabaron ko lekar saamaanya ho sakate hai
 Every year when 19-20 year old boys are found wandering outside the media house of Delhi with complaints of theft and rigging, they are sad to see them
 ham kyon nahin sarkaar se ek phul pruf pariksha pranali kii maang kar sakate hai
 How would you explain to an honest student that someone became a doctor by paying money? phir compatishan kaa kya matlab he
 After these reports, action was taken against any officer related to NEET examination
 isaki koi khabar hamaare haath nahin lagi
 After collecting these headlines in different newspapers, it is found that there is a possibility of break in the medical entrance examination
 shaatir logon ke giroh har saal aate hai or kisi mehnatee chaatr kaa haq uda le jate hai
 Can we not have an honest and reliable examination system in which not a single student is cheated? 26 july ke akhabaaron main ek khabar chhapi, National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) kii post graduate pariksha yojit karne ke liye jis amareeki company ko theka diya gaya he, usne mana he ki pariksha ke system ko koi hack kar saktaa he
 Would it be right to ask the government the question that when India can simultaneously send 108 satellites into space, then it cannot conduct medical entrance examination itself
 kya parikshaayen bhi privet agenciyon se hone lagi hai
 Then who will be responsible for the leak, how will there be confidence that the private company will not deal with anyone
 dilli police krime branch central range kii chargeshit se pataa chalata he ki dilli police ne chandigarh or noida centre kii jaanch kii, acchhee jaanch kii he, magar isi tarah kii jaanch agar desh bhar main ho jaati to jane kitne bharam tuutate or kitna bharosa
 First, understand the system of NEET exam
 neshnal igzamination board neet kii pariksha yojit karata he
 Undergraduate and post graduate exams are under NEET
 under graduate neet pariksha main 10-11 lakh chaatr shaamil hote hai
 The Post Graduate NEET Exam consists of close to three lakh students
 ye teen lakh wo chaatr hai jo paanch saal kii medical padhai pard chuke hote hai
 There are about 25000 seats for PG, out of which only eleven thousand are government
 privet kalejon se piji karnaa karodon kaa khel he isliye har doctor sarkari seat ke liye taiyaari karata he
 Out of 10-11000 PG seats in the government, only 6-7000 are clinical, ie in which you can practice
 ek ek seat ke liye maaramaari hoti he
 The doctor starts preparing for PG from the very first year i
e
 after taking admission in the medical college
 jab use yah pataa chale ki isamen bhi kuch log agent sab agent ke zariye unki mehnat par daaka daal rahe hai to ve kitne hataash hote honge
 On the complaint of rigging in PG NEET examination held in December 2016, Delhi Police started investigation, many such things have come to the fore
 piji neet kii pariksha kaa theka america kii ek company prometric ko diya gaya
 This company has told the police that its software may be tampered with
 police jaanch kar rahi thi ki pariksha kaa software hack ho saktaa he yaa nahin
 The 20-page charge sheet has dangerous stories ranging from hacking to fixing
 chargeshit he, dosha sabit nahin hua he
 We are trying to understand the examination system under the pretext of this charge sheet
 dilli police par zimmedaari hogi ki wo is chargeshit ko sabit bhi kare
 Police came to know that the accused had planned the hacking plan long before the examination began
 chaatro se paise lekar unhen yah bhi kaha gaya ki kis centre kaa chunaav karen, uske aage kaa ve log dekh lenge
 The Delhi Police has also arrested four people in this regard
 dilli police ne chaar logon ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 Two supervisors from examination centers in Chandigarh and Noida have helped some students
 jis sarwar se pariksha ho rahi thi, use hack kar inaki madad kii gai
 During interrogation, the police found out that Prometric Testings Pvt Ltd had been awarded the contract for the examination
 chargeshit ke anusaar is company ne CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd ke saath qaraar kiya ki wo ejeeniyar or site suparviser or anya staff uplabdh karaae taaki agzaam lab taiyaar ho sake
 CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd has tied up with m / s Apex Services to arrange for the need of technical staff in the examination centers
 police kaa maananaa he ki itani kadi banati chali gai ki kai agent or sab agent is system main paidaa ho gaye jo chaatro ko khojane lage ki paise mil jaae to use acha rank de diya jaae
 The first step is to meet the candidate
 ummidavaar milte hi The sub agent used to tell his senior agent
 senior agent mata pita yaa chaatr ke sampark main aa jaataa he
 These agents keep in touch with the site's supervisor, the engineer
 ummidavaar ko bataaya jaataa he ki koun sa pariksha centre chune
 Where the authorities can help him in counterfeiting
 pariksha yojit karne vaali company police ko us software ke bare main nahin bataa saki jiske sahare pariksha ko hack kiya gaya he
 The student who gave the money was given access to the exam computer through the Internet and the exam hall was connected to the outside computer
 ye to post graduate pariksha kaa haal he kareeb teen lakh ke kareeb chaatr hissaa lete hai
 According to an Indian Express news, some 200 students are expected to pass through this route
 jis pariksha pranali par lakhon chaatro or unke pariwaron par itnaa bharosa he wo bharosa tutaa kaise
 Because of which
 is maamle ko uthaane vaale anand raay kaa daawa he ki amareeki company ko bina tender ke hi pariksha yojit karne kaa theka de diya gaya
 Anand Rai has been raising this issue for two consecutive years
 is baar jab embibies ke liye neet kii pariksha ke liye chaatr chatraayen pariksha kender pahunte to unki sakhti se jaanch kii gai
 The investigation took place after removing the clothes
 kapade katar diye gaye
 There is an incident in Kerala but there is no theft, no one can copy it, for this, there was such a check that everyone must have felt that they will not be cheated
 ab nakal khatm
 The dress code has been issued as to how to reach the examination center
 kerala ke kannur main thodaa zyaada ho gaya magar chaatro ko ek aisi pariksha pranali kaa intazaar to he hi jis par aankh moond kar bharosa kiya ja sake
 You have seen the condition of NEET PG, now see the condition of NEET undergraduate exam in newspaper news
 patna police sibiesai kii anumati kaa intazaar kar rahi he taaki jis trunk main prashn patr laae gaye unki forencik jaanch ho sake
 On May 7, NEET examination was conducted on 32 of Patna and 20 of Gaya
 police kaa daawa he ki usne prashn patr li karne kii koshish ko naakaam kar diya
 Many people were arrested in this connection
 aap 41 may 2017 kaa times of india dekh sakate hai
 a day before in Patna's Dainik Jagran, news appears on the page that a deal of three crores was made with the kingpin to pass the exam
 ek khabar ke hedline main kaha gaya he ki paanch giroh hai jo 20 lakh main paas karaane kii guarantee lete hai
 There have also been reports from many places that by taking money, the centers duped many candidates by providing answers to 120 questions instead of 145
 is saal may main yojit neet yuji pariksha kii jaanch goa police kar rahi he, rajasthan kii aties kar rahi he or patna police kar rahi he
 When Anand Rai complained to the Delhi Police, he got a verbal reply that Neet is so busy with the investigation of PG that it is not possible to pay much attention to the investigation of Neet UG
 neet embibies or neet piji kii pariksha vyavastha puri tarah chori mukt nahin he
 The system should be such that there is no chance of rumor and no one can cheat anyone
 akhabaaron kii cliping dekhte hue lag rahaa tha ki har rajya main is pariksha ko lekar girohon kaa apana system he
 This is when Vyapam scam happened in a similar manner
 yahaan tak ki ames kii pravesh pariksha bhi sandigdh ho jaati he
 On June 15, the CBI registered a case on AIIMS MBBS for leaking the question paper
 28 may ko pariksha hui thi
 The Delhi High Court had sought a status report in the case of AIIMS paper leak to the Central Government, AIIMS and CBI
 anand raay is maamle main yachika karta hai or prashanth bhushan vakil hai
 The next hearing is on August 16
 sibiai ne kai jagahon par chhapemari bhi kii he
 In 2003, a big scam came out regarding AIIMS examination
 mukhya aaropee ranjit don kaa naam yaad hoga jo bank, ejineering, medical ke prashn patr li karata tha
 Many older people were his clients, who wanted to engineer their children on the basis of money
 sibiai kii jaanch hui thi
 It was a business of 100 crores
 2003 ke baad 2017 main sibiai phir ames pariksha kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The comments mujhe pataa he ki ye sawaal netaaon ke bekaar ke aarope pratyarope jitne mahatvapurn nahin hai lekin sochiye ki paisa dekar bina padhai ke koi doctor ban jaae or aapkaa ilaaj karne lage
 It is not just about becoming a doctor, the government has spent public money on a student who has become a doctor by way of theft by giving money
 ek baar wo chori ke raste se doctor banegaa to doctorl kii naitikta kaa paalan kaise karegaa
 Vyapam scam was not properly debated in this country for political reasons but should have taken place
 supreme court ne sibiai se kaha he ki jaldi se sabhi maamalon main chargeshit file kiijie or hard discs kii report bhopal ke sibiai trial court main jamaa kiijie
 Till 31 October, the CBI has been asked to file a chargesheet in all the cases
 vyapam maamle main 200 se adhik exiaar darj he
 Anand Rai says that 2500 accused were made
 2000 giraftaar bhi hue the
 Vyapam's Bhanda broke out, but it should not happen that such a scam is happening about Neet
 hindu akhbaar kii report he 4 april 2017 kii
 a report of CAG was kept in Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly
 isamen kaha gaya ki rajya sarkaar ne parikshaon ke liye uchit regulatory fremawork rakhaa hi nahin jisaki vajah se ummidavaaron kaa bhavishya kharaab hua
 Vyapam is a department, not a regulatory body
 niyamon ko taak par rakhkar afasaron kii niyuktiyaan kii gayi
 The government also did not keep data on how many examinations have taken place
 pataa chalata he ki paardarshita kii ghor kami he

 Then who will be responsible for the leak, how will there be confidence that the private company will not deal with anyone

 It is not just about becoming a doctor, the government has spent public money on a student who has become a doctor by way of theft by giving money
 ek baar wo chori ke raste se doctor banegaa to doctorl kii naitikta kaa paalan kaise karegaa
 Vyapam scam was not properly debated in this country for political reasons but should have taken place
 supreme court ne sibiai se kaha he ki jaldi se sabhi maamalon main chargeshit file kiijie or hard discs kii report bhopal ke sibiai trial court main jamaa kiijie

 This year, when the officials were upset with the news of the form being leaked on the first day of the twelfth exam in Rajasthan, it was later learned that it was rumored
 2015 main tamilnadu main ganit kaa parchaa li ho gaya, chaar shikshak bhi giraftaar kiye gaye
 Officials accepted the leak of the physical science paper in the secondary examination in March this year in Bengal

 If paper leakage is a pan-india problem, then every state should be guaranteed to remove it

 i am not saying that the news of the leaks has been published in the newspapers, they are all right, may or may not happen, but the return of these reports every year suggests that the gangs who steal are around the examination centers

 If a student also gets admission through Vyapam, then it is unfair to have hundreds of honest students
 ham kaise in khabaron ko lekar saamaanya ho sakate hai
 Every year when 19-20 year old boys are found wandering outside the media house of Delhi with complaints of theft and rigging, they are sad to see them
 ham kyon nahin sarkaar se ek phul pruf pariksha pranali kii maang kar sakate hai
 How would you explain to an honest student that someone became a doctor by paying money? phir compatishan kaa kya matlab he
 After these reports, action was taken against any officer related to NEET examination
 isaki koi khabar hamaare haath nahin lagi

 The controversy in Bihar's examination was also in 2016
 urisa main nakal na karne dene par chaatro ne teacher ko hi kamare main band kar diya
 In Jammu and Kashmir, in February this year, there was so much news of cheating in the science examination of class 10 that some centers had to be canceled
 is saal jab rajasthan main barahavin pariksha ke pehle din hi parchaa li hone kii khabaron se adhikari pareshaan ho gaye, baad main pataa chalaa ki afvaah thi
 In 2015, the form of mathematics was leaked in Tamil Nadu, four teachers were also arrested
 bengal main isi saal march kii madhyamik pariksha main physical science kaa parchaa li hone kii baat adhikariyon ne maan lee
 The Telegraph has written that the officials say that the form has not been leaked but the question paper which is circulating on Whats is the question paper of Physical Science
 april 2017 main dasvin class kaa ganit kaa paper out ho gaya
 The examination was canceled and orders for investigation were given
 madhyapradesh main chemistry or physics kaa parchaa bhi whats ap par aane kii afvaah udi thi
 Tell this is the condition of the board examinations of eleven states
 agar paper li hona akhil bhartiya samasya he to ise dur karne kii guarantee har rajya ko deni chahie
 a culture of honest system cannot exist without an honest examination system
 main nahin kah rahaa ki akhbaar main li hone kii khabar chhapi he wo sabhi sahi hai, ho saktaa he na ho lekin har saal in khabaron kaa laut aana bataata he ki chori karaane vaale giroh pariksha kendron ke aasapaas hi rahete hai
 After each examination, the group of students is divided into two classes
 ek jisane nakal nahin kii, doosraa jisane nakal kii
 The tradition of being considered smart by imitators should stop
 dasvin or barahavin kii pariksha ke baad medilak pravesh pariksha kii khabaron ko khangaalane baitha to sthiti utani hi bhayanak nazar ain
 The students preparing for medicine strangulate their bones, how much money the parents spend, and how helpless they will find themselves when they know that NEET has been rigged
 agar ek chaatr bhi vyapam ke tareeke se admician paa jaae to yah sainkadon eemaandaar chaatro ke saath ninsaphi he
 How can we be normal about these news stories? har saal jab 19-20 saal ke ladke chori or dhaandhlee kii shikaayat lekar dilli ke media house ke baahar bhatakate milte hai to unhen dekhakar dukh hota he
 Why can't we demand a full proof examination system from the government
 ek eemaandaar chaatr ko aap kaise samajhaayenge ki paisa dekar koi doctor ban gaya
 Then what is the meaning of competition? kya in khabaron ke baad neet pariksha se jude kisi adhikari ke khilaaf karrwai hui
 We did not get any news about it
 alag-alag akhabaaron ke ye hedline ek jagah jamaa kar dekhne par pataa chalata he ki medical pravesh pariksha main send kii guzaaish lagati he
 Gangs of vicious people come every year and take away the rights of any hardworking student
 kya hamen ek eemaandaar or bharosemand pariksha pranali nahin mil sakati jisamen ek bhi chaatr ke saath dhokhaa na ho
 The US company, which has been contracted to conduct the post-graduate examination of the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET), appeared in a news paper on 26 July, believed that one could hack the exam system
 kya sarkaar se yah sawaal poochna thik hoga ki jab bharat ek saath 108 upgrah antariksh main bhej saktaa he to kya medical pravesh pariksha khud yojit nahin kar saktaa he
 Are the examinations also started from private agencies? phir li hone kii javabdehi kiski hogi, kaise bharosa paidaa hoga ki privet company ne kisi ke saath sauda nahin kiya hoga
 The charge sheet of the Delhi Police Crime Branch Central Range shows that the Delhi Police has investigated Chandigarh and Noida Center, have done a good investigation, but if a similar investigation was conducted across the country, then how much would have broken and how much trust
 pehle neet pariksha ke system ko samajhiye
 The National Examination Board conducts the examination of NEET
 under graduate or post graduate kii pariksha neet ke tahat hoti he
 Undergraduate NEET exam consists of 10-11 lakh students
 post graduate neet pariksha main teen lakh ke kareeb chaatr shaamil hote hai
 These are the three lakh students who have studied five years of medical education
 piji ke liye kareeb 25000 seat hoti hai jinamein se das gyaarah hazaar hi sarkari hote hai
 Doing PG from private colleges is a game of crores, so every doctor prepares for the government seat
 sarkaar kii 10-11000 piji seat main se 6-7000 hi clinical hoti he yani jisamen aap practice kar sakate hai
 There is a fight for each seat
 doctor medical kalege main admician lete hi yani pehle hi saal se pi ji kii taiyaari shuru kar detaa he
 When he comes to know that some people in this too, agents are trying to rob him of his hard work through all agents, then how desperate they must be
 disambar 2016 main hui pi ji neet kii pariksha main dhaandhlee kii shikaayat par dilli police ne jaanch shuru kii to kai aisi baaten saamne ai hai jo hairaan karne vaali hai
 The contract for PG NEET was awarded to Prometric, a US company
 is company ne police ko bataaya he ki uske software se chhedchhad ho sakati he
 The police were investigating whether the exam software could be hacked
 20 panne kii chargeshit main hanking se lekar phixing ke khataranaak kisse hai
 There is a charge sheet, the defect has not been proved
 ham is chargeshit ke bahaane pariksha pranali ko samajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 It will be the responsibility of Delhi Police to prove this charge sheet as well
 police ko pataa chalaa ki aropiyon ne hekking kii yojana imtahaan shuru hone se bahut pehle bana lee thi
 Taking money from the students, they were also told that they will see the center next to which center to choose
 is sambandh main dilli police ne chaar logon ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 Delhi Police has also arrested four people
 chandigarh or noida ke pariksha kendron ke do suparviser ne kuch chaatro kii madad kii he
 The server through which the examination was being conducted was hacked and helped
 poochtacha ke dauraan police ko pataa laga ki pariksha ke liye Prometric Testings Pvt Ltd ko theka diya gaya he
 According to the chargesheet, the company signed an agreement with CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd to provide engineers and site supervisors and other staff to prepare the exam lab
 CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd ne m / s Apex Services ke saath qaraar kiya ki pariksha kendaron main technical staff kii zarurat padegi uski vyavastha kare
 Police believe that the link has become so strong that many agents and sub-agents have been born in this system, who start searching for the students that if they get the money then they should be given a good rank
 pehla charan he ummidavaar kaa milanaa
 As soon as the candidate meets sab agent apane senior agent ko bataa detaa tha
 The senior agent gets in touch with the parent or student

 The examination system of NEET MBBS and NEET PG is not completely theft free
 system aisa hona chahie ki afvaah kii bhi guzaaish na rahe or koi kisi ko thag nahin paae
 Seeing the clipping of newspapers, it seemed that gangs have their own system in this state for this test
 ye tab he jab isi tarah se vyapam ghotaalaa hua tha
 Even AIIMS entrance examination becomes suspicious

 After 2003, CBI is again examining the AIIMS examination in 2017
 tippaniyan i know that these questions are not as important as the false accusations of politicians, but think that by paying money, become a doctor without studying and start treating you
 baat sirf doctor banane kaa nahin he, sarkaar ne janata kaa paisa ek aise chaatr par kharch kiya jo paise dekar chori ke raste se doctor bana he
 Once he becomes a doctor by way of theft, how will he follow the morality of the doctor

 The Hindu newspaper reported 4 April 2017
 madhyapradesh vidhaan sabha main sieji kii ek report rakhi gai
 It said that the state government had not kept proper regulatory framework for the examinations, due to which the future of the candidates was spoiled
 vyapam ek vibhaag he,niamak sanstha nahin he
 Officers were appointed keeping rules in mind
 sarkaar ne ye bhi data nahin rakhaa kitni parikshaayen hui hai
 There is a great lack of transparency
 2015 main tamilnadu main ganit kaa parchaa li ho gaya, chaar shikshak bhi giraftaar kiye gaye
 Officials accepted the leak of the physical science paper in the secondary examination in March this year in Bengal
 telegraph ne likhaa he ki adhikari kehete hai ki parchaa li nahin hua he magar whats par jo prashn patr gum rahaa he wo physical science kaa hi prashn patr he
 Mathematics paper of class x was out in April 2017
 pariksha radd hui or jaanch ke aadesh die gaye
 In Madhya Pradesh, the paper of Chemistry and Physics was also rumored to be on Whats Up
 bataaiye gyaarah rajyon kii board parikshaon kaa ye haal he
 If paper leakage is a pan-india problem, then every state should be guaranteed to remove it
 eemaandaar pariksha pranali ke bagair eemaandaar vyavastha kii samskruti ban hi nahin sakati he
 i am not saying that the news of the leaks has been published in the newspapers, they are all right, may or may not happen, but the return of these reports every year suggests that the gangs who steal are around the examination centers
 har imtahaan ke baad chaatro kaa samooh do virgon main bant jaataa he
 One who did not copy, the other who copied
 nakal karne waalon ko smart samajhane kii parampara par roak lagani chahie
 After the tenth and twelfth exams Medilak sat looking at the news of the entrance examination, the situation looked equally terrible
 medical kii taiyaari karne vaale chaatr apni haddi galaa dete hai, maa baap kaa kitna paisa karch hota he, or jab inhen pataa chalata hoga ki neet kii pariksha main dhaandhlee hui he, to wo khud ko kitna asahaay pate honge
 If a student also gets admission through Vyapam, then it is unfair to have hundreds of honest students
 ham kaise in khabaron ko lekar saamaanya ho sakate hai
 Every year when 19-20 year old boys are found wandering outside the media house of Delhi with complaints of theft and rigging, they are sad to see them
 ham kyon nahin sarkaar se ek phul pruf pariksha pranali kii maang kar sakate hai
 How would you explain to an honest student that someone became a doctor by paying money? phir compatishan kaa kya matlab he
 After these reports, action was taken against any officer related to NEET examination
 isaki koi khabar hamaare haath nahin lagi
 After collecting these headlines in different newspapers, it is found that there is a possibility of break in the medical entrance examination
 shaatir logon ke giroh har saal aate hai or kisi mehnatee chaatr kaa haq uda le jate hai
 Can we not have an honest and reliable examination system in which not a single student is cheated? 26 july ke akhabaaron main ek khabar chhapi, National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) kii post graduate pariksha yojit karne ke liye jis amareeki company ko theka diya gaya he, usne mana he ki pariksha ke system ko koi hack kar saktaa he
 Would it be right to ask the government the question that when India can simultaneously send 108 satellites into space, then it cannot conduct medical entrance examination itself
 kya parikshaayen bhi privet agenciyon se hone lagi hai
 Then who will be responsible for the leak, how will there be confidence that the private company will not deal with anyone
 dilli police krime branch central range kii chargeshit se pataa chalata he ki dilli police ne chandigarh or noida centre kii jaanch kii, acchhee jaanch kii he, magar isi tarah kii jaanch agar desh bhar main ho jaati to jane kitne bharam tuutate or kitna bharosa
 First, understand the system of NEET exam
 neshnal igzamination board neet kii pariksha yojit karata he
 Undergraduate and post graduate exams are under NEET
 under graduate neet pariksha main 10-11 lakh chaatr shaamil hote hai
 The Post Graduate NEET Exam consists of close to three lakh students
 ye teen lakh wo chaatr hai jo paanch saal kii medical padhai pard chuke hote hai
 There are about 25000 seats for PG, out of which only eleven thousand are government
 privet kalejon se piji karnaa karodon kaa khel he isliye har doctor sarkari seat ke liye taiyaari karata he
 Out of 10-11000 PG seats in the government, only 6-7000 are clinical, ie in which you can practice
 ek ek seat ke liye maaramaari hoti he
 The doctor starts preparing for PG from the very first year i
e
 after taking admission in the medical college
 jab use yah pataa chale ki isamen bhi kuch log agent sab agent ke zariye unki mehnat par daaka daal rahe hai to ve kitne hataash hote honge
 On the complaint of rigging in PG NEET examination held in December 2016, Delhi Police started investigation, many such things have come to the fore
 piji neet kii pariksha kaa theka america kii ek company prometric ko diya gaya
 This company has told the police that its software may be tampered with
 police jaanch kar rahi thi ki pariksha kaa software hack ho saktaa he yaa nahin
 The 20-page charge sheet has dangerous stories ranging from hacking to fixing
 chargeshit he, dosha sabit nahin hua he
 We are trying to understand the examination system under the pretext of this charge sheet
 dilli police par zimmedaari hogi ki wo is chargeshit ko sabit bhi kare
 Police came to know that the accused had planned the hacking plan long before the examination began
 chaatro se paise lekar unhen yah bhi kaha gaya ki kis centre kaa chunaav karen, uske aage kaa ve log dekh lenge
 The Delhi Police has also arrested four people in this regard
 dilli police ne chaar logon ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 Two supervisors from examination centers in Chandigarh and Noida have helped some students
 jis sarwar se pariksha ho rahi thi, use hack kar inaki madad kii gai
 During interrogation, the police found out that Prometric Testings Pvt Ltd had been awarded the contract for the examination
 chargeshit ke anusaar is company ne CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd ke saath qaraar kiya ki wo ejeeniyar or site suparviser or anya staff uplabdh karaae taaki agzaam lab taiyaar ho sake
 CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd has tied up with m / s Apex Services to arrange for the need of technical staff in the examination centers
 police kaa maananaa he ki itani kadi banati chali gai ki kai agent or sab agent is system main paidaa ho gaye jo chaatro ko khojane lage ki paise mil jaae to use acha rank de diya jaae
 The first step is to meet the candidate
 ummidavaar milte hi The sub agent used to tell his senior agent
 senior agent mata pita yaa chaatr ke sampark main aa jaataa he
 These agents keep in touch with the site's supervisor, the engineer
 ummidavaar ko bataaya jaataa he ki koun sa pariksha centre chune
 Where the authorities can help him in counterfeiting
 pariksha yojit karne vaali company police ko us software ke bare main nahin bataa saki jiske sahare pariksha ko hack kiya gaya he
 The student who gave the money was given access to the exam computer through the Internet and the exam hall was connected to the outside computer
 ye to post graduate pariksha kaa haal he kareeb teen lakh ke kareeb chaatr hissaa lete hai
 According to an Indian Express news, some 200 students are expected to pass through this route
 jis pariksha pranali par lakhon chaatro or unke pariwaron par itnaa bharosa he wo bharosa tutaa kaise
 Because of which
 is maamle ko uthaane vaale anand raay kaa daawa he ki amareeki company ko bina tender ke hi pariksha yojit karne kaa theka de diya gaya
 Anand Rai has been raising this issue for two consecutive years
 is baar jab embibies ke liye neet kii pariksha ke liye chaatr chatraayen pariksha kender pahunte to unki sakhti se jaanch kii gai
 The investigation took place after removing the clothes
 kapade katar diye gaye
 There is an incident in Kerala but there is no theft, no one can copy it, for this, there was such a check that everyone must have felt that they will not be cheated
 ab nakal khatm
 The dress code has been issued as to how to reach the examination center
 kerala ke kannur main thodaa zyaada ho gaya magar chaatro ko ek aisi pariksha pranali kaa intazaar to he hi jis par aankh moond kar bharosa kiya ja sake
 You have seen the condition of NEET PG, now see the condition of NEET undergraduate exam in newspaper news
 patna police sibiesai kii anumati kaa intazaar kar rahi he taaki jis trunk main prashn patr laae gaye unki forencik jaanch ho sake
 On May 7, NEET examination was conducted on 32 of Patna and 20 of Gaya
 police kaa daawa he ki usne prashn patr li karne kii koshish ko naakaam kar diya
 Many people were arrested in this connection
 aap 41 may 2017 kaa times of india dekh sakate hai
 a day before in Patna's Dainik Jagran, news appears on the page that a deal of three crores was made with the kingpin to pass the exam
 ek khabar ke hedline main kaha gaya he ki paanch giroh hai jo 20 lakh main paas karaane kii guarantee lete hai
 There have also been reports from many places that by taking money, the centers duped many candidates by providing answers to 120 questions instead of 145
 is saal may main yojit neet yuji pariksha kii jaanch goa police kar rahi he, rajasthan kii aties kar rahi he or patna police kar rahi he
 When Anand Rai complained to the Delhi Police, he got a verbal reply that Neet is so busy with the investigation of PG that it is not possible to pay much attention to the investigation of Neet UG
 neet embibies or neet piji kii pariksha vyavastha puri tarah chori mukt nahin he
 The system should be such that there is no chance of rumor and no one can cheat anyone
 akhabaaron kii cliping dekhte hue lag rahaa tha ki har rajya main is pariksha ko lekar girohon kaa apana system he
 This is when Vyapam scam happened in a similar manner
 yahaan tak ki ames kii pravesh pariksha bhi sandigdh ho jaati he
 On June 15, the CBI registered a case on AIIMS MBBS for leaking the question paper
 28 may ko pariksha hui thi
 The Delhi High Court had sought a status report in the case of AIIMS paper leak to the Central Government, AIIMS and CBI
 anand raay is maamle main yachika karta hai or prashanth bhushan vakil hai
 The next hearing is on August 16
 sibiai ne kai jagahon par chhapemari bhi kii he
 In 2003, a big scam came out regarding AIIMS examination
 mukhya aaropee ranjit don kaa naam yaad hoga jo bank, ejineering, medical ke prashn patr li karata tha
 Many older people were his clients, who wanted to engineer their children on the basis of money
 sibiai kii jaanch hui thi
 It was a business of 100 crores
 2003 ke baad 2017 main sibiai phir ames pariksha kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The comments mujhe pataa he ki ye sawaal netaaon ke bekaar ke aarope pratyarope jitne mahatvapurn nahin hai lekin sochiye ki paisa dekar bina padhai ke koi doctor ban jaae or aapkaa ilaaj karne lage
 It is not just about becoming a doctor, the government has spent public money on a student who has become a doctor by way of theft by giving money
 ek baar wo chori ke raste se doctor banegaa to doctorl kii naitikta kaa paalan kaise karegaa
 Vyapam scam was not properly debated in this country for political reasons but should have taken place
 supreme court ne sibiai se kaha he ki jaldi se sabhi maamalon main chargeshit file kiijie or hard discs kii report bhopal ke sibiai trial court main jamaa kiijie
 Till 31 October, the CBI has been asked to file a chargesheet in all the cases
 vyapam maamle main 200 se adhik exiaar darj he
 Anand Rai says that 2500 accused were made
 2000 giraftaar bhi hue the
 Vyapam's Bhanda broke out, but it should not happen that such a scam is happening about Neet
 hindu akhbaar kii report he 4 april 2017 kii
 a report of CAG was kept in Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly
 isamen kaha gaya ki rajya sarkaar ne parikshaon ke liye uchit regulatory fremawork rakhaa hi nahin jisaki vajah se ummidavaaron kaa bhavishya kharaab hua
 Vyapam is a department, not a regulatory body
 niyamon ko taak par rakhkar afasaron kii niyuktiyaan kii gayi
 The government also did not keep data on how many examinations have taken place
 pataa chalata he ki paardarshita kii ghor kami he
 Tell this is the condition of the board examinations of eleven states
 agar paper li hona akhil bhartiya samasya he to ise dur karne kii guarantee har rajya ko deni chahie
 a culture of honest system cannot exist without an honest examination system
 main nahin kah rahaa ki akhbaar main li hone kii khabar chhapi he wo sabhi sahi hai, ho saktaa he na ho lekin har saal in khabaron kaa laut aana bataata he ki chori karaane vaale giroh pariksha kendron ke aasapaas hi rahete hai
 After each examination, the group of students is divided into two classes
 ek jisane nakal nahin kii, doosraa jisane nakal kii
 The tradition of being considered smart by imitators should stop
 dasvin or barahavin kii pariksha ke baad medilak pravesh pariksha kii khabaron ko khangaalane baitha to sthiti utani hi bhayanak nazar ain
 The students preparing for medicine strangulate their bones, how much money the parents spend, and how helpless they will find themselves when they know that NEET has been rigged
 agar ek chaatr bhi vyapam ke tareeke se admician paa jaae to yah sainkadon eemaandaar chaatro ke saath ninsaphi he
 How can we be normal about these news stories? har saal jab 19-20 saal ke ladke chori or dhaandhlee kii shikaayat lekar dilli ke media house ke baahar bhatakate milte hai to unhen dekhakar dukh hota he
 Why can't we demand a full proof examination system from the government
 ek eemaandaar chaatr ko aap kaise samajhaayenge ki paisa dekar koi doctor ban gaya
 Then what is the meaning of competition? kya in khabaron ke baad neet pariksha se jude kisi adhikari ke khilaaf karrwai hui
 We did not get any news about it
 alag-alag akhabaaron ke ye hedline ek jagah jamaa kar dekhne par pataa chalata he ki medical pravesh pariksha main send kii guzaaish lagati he
 Gangs of vicious people come every year and take away the rights of any hardworking student
 kya hamen ek eemaandaar or bharosemand pariksha pranali nahin mil sakati jisamen ek bhi chaatr ke saath dhokhaa na ho
 The US company, which has been contracted to conduct the post-graduate examination of the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET), appeared in a news paper on 26 July, believed that one could hack the exam system
 kya sarkaar se yah sawaal poochna thik hoga ki jab bharat ek saath 108 upgrah antariksh main bhej saktaa he to kya medical pravesh pariksha khud yojit nahin kar saktaa he
 Are the examinations also started from private agencies? phir li hone kii javabdehi kiski hogi, kaise bharosa paidaa hoga ki privet company ne kisi ke saath sauda nahin kiya hoga
 The charge sheet of the Delhi Police Crime Branch Central Range shows that the Delhi Police has investigated Chandigarh and Noida Center, have done a good investigation, but if a similar investigation was conducted across the country, then how much would have broken and how much trust
 pehle neet pariksha ke system ko samajhiye
 The National Examination Board conducts the examination of NEET
 under graduate or post graduate kii pariksha neet ke tahat hoti he
 Undergraduate NEET exam consists of 10-11 lakh students
 post graduate neet pariksha main teen lakh ke kareeb chaatr shaamil hote hai
 These are the three lakh students who have studied five years of medical education
 piji ke liye kareeb 25000 seat hoti hai jinamein se das gyaarah hazaar hi sarkari hote hai
 Doing PG from private colleges is a game of crores, so every doctor prepares for the government seat
 sarkaar kii 10-11000 piji seat main se 6-7000 hi clinical hoti he yani jisamen aap practice kar sakate hai
 There is a fight for each seat
 doctor medical kalege main admician lete hi yani pehle hi saal se pi ji kii taiyaari shuru kar detaa he
 When he comes to know that some people in this too, agents are trying to rob him of his hard work through all agents, then how desperate they must be
 disambar 2016 main hui pi ji neet kii pariksha main dhaandhlee kii shikaayat par dilli police ne jaanch shuru kii to kai aisi baaten saamne ai hai jo hairaan karne vaali hai
 The contract for PG NEET was awarded to Prometric, a US company
 is company ne police ko bataaya he ki uske software se chhedchhad ho sakati he
 The police were investigating whether the exam software could be hacked
 20 panne kii chargeshit main hanking se lekar phixing ke khataranaak kisse hai
 There is a charge sheet, the defect has not been proved
 ham is chargeshit ke bahaane pariksha pranali ko samajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 It will be the responsibility of Delhi Police to prove this charge sheet as well
 police ko pataa chalaa ki aropiyon ne hekking kii yojana imtahaan shuru hone se bahut pehle bana lee thi
 Taking money from the students, they were also told that they will see the center next to which center to choose
 is sambandh main dilli police ne chaar logon ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 Delhi Police has also arrested four people
 chandigarh or noida ke pariksha kendron ke do suparviser ne kuch chaatro kii madad kii he
 The server through which the examination was being conducted was hacked and helped
 poochtacha ke dauraan police ko pataa laga ki pariksha ke liye Prometric Testings Pvt Ltd ko theka diya gaya he
 According to the chargesheet, the company signed an agreement with CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd to provide engineers and site supervisors and other staff to prepare the exam lab
 CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd ne m / s Apex Services ke saath qaraar kiya ki pariksha kendaron main technical staff kii zarurat padegi uski vyavastha kare
 Police believe that the link has become so strong that many agents and sub-agents have been born in this system, who start searching for the students that if they get the money then they should be given a good rank
 pehla charan he ummidavaar kaa milanaa
 As soon as the candidate meets sab agent apane senior agent ko bataa detaa tha
 The senior agent gets in touch with the parent or student
 ye agent site ke suparviser, inzenier ke sampark main rahete hai
 The candidate is told to choose which examination center
 jahaan adhikari use nakal karne main madad sakate hai
 The company conducting the exam could not tell the police about the software with which the exam has been hacked
 paise dene vaale chaatr ko internet ke zariye agzaam computer kaa acces de diya gaya or agzaam haal se baahar ke computer se jod diya gaya
 This is the condition of post graduate examination, about three lakh students take part
 indian express kii ek khabar ke mutabik is raste se koi 200 chaatro ke paas hone kii ashanka he
 How the trust that broke the test system that millions of students and their families have so much confidence in
 kiski vajah se
 Anand Rai, who took up the case, claims that the American company was given the contract to conduct the examination without tender
 anand raay hi lagaataar do teen saal se yah maamla uthaa rahe hai
 This time when the students reached the examination center for NEET exams for MBBS, they were strictly examined

 The US company, which has been contracted to conduct the post-graduate examination of the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET), appeared in a news paper on 26 July, believed that one could hack the exam system
 kya sarkaar se yah sawaal poochna thik hoga ki jab bharat ek saath 108 upgrah antariksh main bhej saktaa he to kya medical pravesh pariksha khud yojit nahin kar saktaa he
 Are the examinations also started from private agencies? phir li hone kii javabdehi kiski hogi, kaise bharosa paidaa hoga ki privet company ne kisi ke saath sauda nahin kiya hoga
 The charge sheet of the Delhi Police Crime Branch Central Range shows that the Delhi Police has investigated Chandigarh and Noida Center, have done a good investigation, but if a similar investigation was conducted across the country, then how much would have broken and how much trust
 pehle neet pariksha ke system ko samajhiye
 The National Examination Board conducts the examination of NEET
 under graduate or post graduate kii pariksha neet ke tahat hoti he
 Undergraduate NEET exam consists of 10-11 lakh students
 post graduate neet pariksha main teen lakh ke kareeb chaatr shaamil hote hai
 These are the three lakh students who have studied five years of medical education
 piji ke liye kareeb 25000 seat hoti hai jinamein se das gyaarah hazaar hi sarkari hote hai
 Doing PG from private colleges is a game of crores, so every doctor prepares for the government seat
 sarkaar kii 10-11000 piji seat main se 6-7000 hi clinical hoti he yani jisamen aap practice kar sakate hai
 There is a fight for each seat
 doctor medical kalege main admician lete hi yani pehle hi saal se pi ji kii taiyaari shuru kar detaa he
 When he comes to know that some people in this too, agents are trying to rob him of his hard work through all agents, then how desperate they must be
 disambar 2016 main hui pi ji neet kii pariksha main dhaandhlee kii shikaayat par dilli police ne jaanch shuru kii to kai aisi baaten saamne ai hai jo hairaan karne vaali hai
 The contract for PG NEET was awarded to Prometric, a US company
 is company ne police ko bataaya he ki uske software se chhedchhad ho sakati he
 The police were investigating whether the exam software could be hacked
 20 panne kii chargeshit main hanking se lekar phixing ke khataranaak kisse hai
 There is a charge sheet, the defect has not been proved
 ham is chargeshit ke bahaane pariksha pranali ko samajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 It will be the responsibility of Delhi Police to prove this charge sheet as well
 police ko pataa chalaa ki aropiyon ne hekking kii yojana imtahaan shuru hone se bahut pehle bana lee thi
 Taking money from the students, they were also told that they will see the center next to which center to choose
 is sambandh main dilli police ne chaar logon ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 Delhi Police has also arrested four people
 chandigarh or noida ke pariksha kendron ke do suparviser ne kuch chaatro kii madad kii he
 The server through which the examination was being conducted was hacked and helped
 poochtacha ke dauraan police ko pataa laga ki pariksha ke liye Prometric Testings Pvt Ltd ko theka diya gaya he
 According to the chargesheet, the company signed an agreement with CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd to provide engineers and site supervisors and other staff to prepare the exam lab
 CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd ne m / s Apex Services ke saath qaraar kiya ki pariksha kendaron main technical staff kii zarurat padegi uski vyavastha kare
 Police believe that the link has become so strong that many agents and sub-agents have been born in this system, who start searching for the students that if they get the money then they should be given a good rank
 pehla charan he ummidavaar kaa milanaa
 As soon as the candidate meets sab agent apane senior agent ko bataa detaa tha
 The senior agent gets in touch with the parent or student
 ye agent site ke suparviser, inzenier ke sampark main rahete hai
 The candidate is told to choose which examination center
 jahaan adhikari use nakal karne main madad sakate hai
 The company conducting the exam could not tell the police about the software with which the exam has been hacked
 paise dene vaale chaatr ko internet ke zariye agzaam computer kaa acces de diya gaya or agzaam haal se baahar ke computer se jod diya gaya
 This is the condition of post graduate examination, about three lakh students take part
 indian express kii ek khabar ke mutabik is raste se koi 200 chaatro ke paas hone kii ashanka he
 How the trust that broke the test system that millions of students and their families have so much confidence in
 kiski vajah se
 Anand Rai, who took up the case, claims that the American company was given the contract to conduct the examination without tender
 anand raay hi lagaataar do teen saal se yah maamla uthaa rahe hai
 This time when the students reached the examination center for NEET exams for MBBS, they were strictly examined
 kapade utaravakar jaanch hui
 Clothes were given to Qatar
 kerala kii ghatana he magar chori na ho, koi nakal na kar sake iske liye aisi checking hui ki vaaki sabko laga hoga ki unke saath dhokhaa nahin hoga
 Now copying is over
 baqayda dress code jari hua ki pariksha kender par kaise pahunchnaa he
 Kannur in Kerala is a bit much, but the students are waiting for an exam system that can be trusted blindly
 neet piji kaa haal to dekh liya aapane, ab akhabaaron kii khabaron main neet under grugeet pariksha kaa haal dekhiye
 Patna Police is waiting for the permission of CBSE so that the trunk in which the question papers were brought can be forensic examined

 You can see the Times of India of 41 May 2017
 patna ke dainik jaagran main ek din pehle panne par khabar chhapati he ki sargana se teen karod kii deal hui thi pariksha paas karaane ke liye
 a news headline states that there are five gangs who take a guarantee of passing in 20 lakhs
 kai jagah se aisi bhi khabaren chhapi hai ki paisa lekar centaron ne thaga kai abhyarthiyon ko, 145 kii jagah 120 prashnon ke hi uttar uplabdh karaae
 The Goa Police is investigating the NEET UG examination conducted in May this year, the ATS of Rajasthan and the Patna Police
 anand raay ne jab dilli police ko shikaayat kii to maukhik jawaab mila ki abhi neet pi ji kii jaanch main hi itnaa vyast hai ki neet yuji kii jaanch main utana dhyaan dena sambhav nahin he
 The examination system of NEET MBBS and NEET PG is not completely theft free
 system aisa hona chahie ki afvaah kii bhi guzaaish na rahe or koi kisi ko thag nahin paae
 Seeing the clipping of newspapers, it seemed that gangs have their own system in this state for this test
 ye tab he jab isi tarah se vyapam ghotaalaa hua tha
 Even AIIMS entrance examination becomes suspicious
 isi 15 june ko sibiai ne ames embibies kaa prashn patr li hone ke aarope main maamla darj kiya he
 The examination took place on 28 May
 dilli hai court ne centre sarkaar, ames or sibiai ko ames paper li ke maamle main states report maangi thi
 Anand Rai is the petitioner in this case and Prashant Bhushan is the lawyer
 16 agast ko agali sunwaayee he
 The CBI has also conducted raids at many places
 2003 main ames kii pariksha ko lekar bada ghotaalaa saamne aayaa tha
 The main accused Ranjit Dawn will remember the name which leaked the question papers of Bank, Engineering, Medical
 kai bade log uske client hote the jo apane bacchon ko paise ke dam par doctor ejeeniyar bana dena chaahate the
 The CBI was investigated
 100 karod kaa dhandha tha yah
 After 2003, CBI is again examining the AIIMS examination in 2017
 tippaniyan i know that these questions are not as important as the false accusations of politicians, but think that by paying money, become a doctor without studying and start treating you
 baat sirf doctor banane kaa nahin he, sarkaar ne janata kaa paisa ek aise chaatr par kharch kiya jo paise dekar chori ke raste se doctor bana he
 Once he becomes a doctor by way of theft, how will he follow the morality of the doctor
 is desh main raajnneetik kaarnon se vyapam ghotaale par thik se bahes nahin hui lekin honi chahie thi
 The Supreme Court has asked the CBI to quickly file the charge sheet in all cases and submit the hard disk report to the CBI Trial Court of Bhopal
 31 oktober tak sibiai se kaha gaya he ki sabhi cese main chargeshit file kerani he
 More than 200 firs have been registered in Vyapam case
 anand raay kaa kahana he ki 2500 aaropee banaae gaye the
 2000 were also arrested
 vyapam kaa bhanda to foot gaya magar kahin aisa na ho ki neet ko lekar bhi is tarah kaa ghotaalaa ho rahaa ho
 The Hindu newspaper reported 4 April 2017
 madhyapradesh vidhaan sabha main sieji kii ek report rakhi gai
 It said that the state government had not kept proper regulatory framework for the examinations, due to which the future of the candidates was spoiled
 vyapam ek vibhaag he,niamak sanstha nahin he
 Officers were appointed keeping rules in mind
 sarkaar ne ye bhi data nahin rakhaa kitni parikshaayen hui hai
 There is a great lack of transparency
 neshnal igzamination board neet kii pariksha yojit karata he
 Undergraduate and post graduate exams are under NEET
 under graduate neet pariksha main 10-11 lakh chaatr shaamil hote hai
 The Post Graduate NEET Exam consists of close to three lakh students

 There are about 25000 seats for PG, out of which only eleven thousand are government
 privet kalejon se piji karnaa karodon kaa khel he isliye har doctor sarkari seat ke liye taiyaari karata he
 Out of 10-11000 PG seats in the government, only 6-7000 are clinical, ie in which you can practice
 ek ek seat ke liye maaramaari hoti he
 The doctor starts preparing for PG from the very first year i

 The Delhi Police has also arrested four people in this regard

 During interrogation, the police found out that Prometric Testings Pvt Ltd had been awarded the contract for the examination
 chargeshit ke anusaar is company ne CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd ke saath qaraar kiya ki wo ejeeniyar or site suparviser or anya staff uplabdh karaae taaki agzaam lab taiyaar ho sake
 CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd has tied up with m / s Apex Services to arrange for the need of technical staff in the examination centers
 police kaa maananaa he ki itani kadi banati chali gai ki kai agent or sab agent is system main paidaa ho gaye jo chaatro ko khojane lage ki paise mil jaae to use acha rank de diya jaae
 The first step is to meet the candidate

 The student who gave the money was given access to the exam computer through the Internet and the exam hall was connected to the outside computer

 According to an Indian Express news, some 200 students are expected to pass through this route
 jis pariksha pranali par lakhon chaatro or unke pariwaron par itnaa bharosa he wo bharosa tutaa kaise
 Because of which
 is maamle ko uthaane vaale anand raay kaa daawa he ki amareeki company ko bina tender ke hi pariksha yojit karne kaa theka de diya gaya
 Anand Rai has been raising this issue for two consecutive years
 is baar jab embibies ke liye neet kii pariksha ke liye chaatr chatraayen pariksha kender pahunte to unki sakhti se jaanch kii gai
 The investigation took place after removing the clothes
 kapade katar diye gaye
 There is an incident in Kerala but there is no theft, no one can copy it, for this, there was such a check that everyone must have felt that they will not be cheated
 ab nakal khatm
 The dress code has been issued as to how to reach the examination center
 kerala ke kannur main thodaa zyaada ho gaya magar chaatro ko ek aisi pariksha pranali kaa intazaar to he hi jis par aankh moond kar bharosa kiya ja sake
 You have seen the condition of NEET PG, now see the condition of NEET undergraduate exam in newspaper news
 patna police sibiesai kii anumati kaa intazaar kar rahi he taaki jis trunk main prashn patr laae gaye unki forencik jaanch ho sake
 On May 7, NEET examination was conducted on 32 of Patna and 20 of Gaya
 police kaa daawa he ki usne prashn patr li karne kii koshish ko naakaam kar diya
 Many people were arrested in this connection
 aap 41 may 2017 kaa times of india dekh sakate hai
 a day before in Patna's Dainik Jagran, news appears on the page that a deal of three crores was made with the kingpin to pass the exam
 ek khabar ke hedline main kaha gaya he ki paanch giroh hai jo 20 lakh main paas karaane kii guarantee lete hai
 There have also been reports from many places that by taking money, the centers duped many candidates by providing answers to 120 questions instead of 145
 is saal may main yojit neet yuji pariksha kii jaanch goa police kar rahi he, rajasthan kii aties kar rahi he or patna police kar rahi he
 When Anand Rai complained to the Delhi Police, he got a verbal reply that Neet is so busy with the investigation of PG that it is not possible to pay much attention to the investigation of Neet UG
 neet embibies or neet piji kii pariksha vyavastha puri tarah chori mukt nahin he
 The system should be such that there is no chance of rumor and no one can cheat anyone
 akhabaaron kii cliping dekhte hue lag rahaa tha ki har rajya main is pariksha ko lekar girohon kaa apana system he
 This is when Vyapam scam happened in a similar manner
 yahaan tak ki ames kii pravesh pariksha bhi sandigdh ho jaati he
 On June 15, the CBI registered a case on AIIMS MBBS for leaking the question paper
 28 may ko pariksha hui thi
 The Delhi High Court had sought a status report in the case of AIIMS paper leak to the Central Government, AIIMS and CBI
 anand raay is maamle main yachika karta hai or prashanth bhushan vakil hai
 The next hearing is on August 16
 sibiai ne kai jagahon par chhapemari bhi kii he
 In 2003, a big scam came out regarding AIIMS examination
 mukhya aaropee ranjit don kaa naam yaad hoga jo bank, ejineering, medical ke prashn patr li karata tha
 Many older people were his clients, who wanted to engineer their children on the basis of money
 sibiai kii jaanch hui thi
 It was a business of 100 crores
 2003 ke baad 2017 main sibiai phir ames pariksha kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The comments mujhe pataa he ki ye sawaal netaaon ke bekaar ke aarope pratyarope jitne mahatvapurn nahin hai lekin sochiye ki paisa dekar bina padhai ke koi doctor ban jaae or aapkaa ilaaj karne lage
 It is not just about becoming a doctor, the government has spent public money on a student who has become a doctor by way of theft by giving money
 ek baar wo chori ke raste se doctor banegaa to doctorl kii naitikta kaa paalan kaise karegaa
 Vyapam scam was not properly debated in this country for political reasons but should have taken place
 supreme court ne sibiai se kaha he ki jaldi se sabhi maamalon main chargeshit file kiijie or hard discs kii report bhopal ke sibiai trial court main jamaa kiijie
 Till 31 October, the CBI has been asked to file a chargesheet in all the cases
 vyapam maamle main 200 se adhik exiaar darj he
 Anand Rai says that 2500 accused were made
 2000 giraftaar bhi hue the
 Vyapam's Bhanda broke out, but it should not happen that such a scam is happening about Neet
 hindu akhbaar kii report he 4 april 2017 kii
 a report of CAG was kept in Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly
 isamen kaha gaya ki rajya sarkaar ne parikshaon ke liye uchit regulatory fremawork rakhaa hi nahin jisaki vajah se ummidavaaron kaa bhavishya kharaab hua
 Vyapam is a department, not a regulatory body
 niyamon ko taak par rakhkar afasaron kii niyuktiyaan kii gayi
 The government also did not keep data on how many examinations have taken place
 pataa chalata he ki paardarshita kii ghor kami he
 There is a fight for each seat
 doctor medical kalege main admician lete hi yani pehle hi saal se pi ji kii taiyaari shuru kar detaa he
 When he comes to know that some people in this too, agents are trying to rob him of his hard work through all agents, then how desperate they must be
 disambar 2016 main hui pi ji neet kii pariksha main dhaandhlee kii shikaayat par dilli police ne jaanch shuru kii to kai aisi baaten saamne ai hai jo hairaan karne vaali hai
 The contract for PG NEET was awarded to Prometric, a US company
 is company ne police ko bataaya he ki uske software se chhedchhad ho sakati he
 The police were investigating whether the exam software could be hacked
 20 panne kii chargeshit main hanking se lekar phixing ke khataranaak kisse hai
 There is a charge sheet, the defect has not been proved
 ham is chargeshit ke bahaane pariksha pranali ko samajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 It will be the responsibility of Delhi Police to prove this charge sheet as well
 police ko pataa chalaa ki aropiyon ne hekking kii yojana imtahaan shuru hone se bahut pehle bana lee thi
 Taking money from the students, they were also told that they will see the center next to which center to choose

 Delhi Police has also arrested four people

 The server through which the examination was being conducted was hacked and helped
 poochtacha ke dauraan police ko pataa laga ki pariksha ke liye Prometric Testings Pvt Ltd ko theka diya gaya he
 According to the chargesheet, the company signed an agreement with CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd to provide engineers and site supervisors and other staff to prepare the exam lab
 CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd ne m / s Apex Services ke saath qaraar kiya ki pariksha kendaron main technical staff kii zarurat padegi uski vyavastha kare
 Police believe that the link has become so strong that many agents and sub-agents have been born in this system, who start searching for the students that if they get the money then they should be given a good rank
 pehla charan he ummidavaar kaa milanaa
 As soon as the candidate meets sab agent apane senior agent ko bataa detaa tha
 The senior agent gets in touch with the parent or student
 ye agent site ke suparviser, inzenier ke sampark main rahete hai
 The candidate is told to choose which examination center
 jahaan adhikari use nakal karne main madad sakate hai
 The company conducting the exam could not tell the police about the software with which the exam has been hacked
 paise dene vaale chaatr ko internet ke zariye agzaam computer kaa acces de diya gaya or agzaam haal se baahar ke computer se jod diya gaya
 This is the condition of post graduate examination, about three lakh students take part
 indian express kii ek khabar ke mutabik is raste se koi 200 chaatro ke paas hone kii ashanka he
 How the trust that broke the test system that millions of students and their families have so much confidence in

 anand raay hi lagaataar do teen saal se yah maamla uthaa rahe hai
 This time when the students reached the examination center for NEET exams for MBBS, they were strictly examined

 anand raay ne jab dilli police ko shikaayat kii to maukhik jawaab mila ki abhi neet pi ji kii jaanch main hi itnaa vyast hai ki neet yuji kii jaanch main utana dhyaan dena sambhav nahin he
 The examination system of NEET MBBS and NEET PG is not completely theft free
 system aisa hona chahie ki afvaah kii bhi guzaaish na rahe or koi kisi ko thag nahin paae
 Seeing the clipping of newspapers, it seemed that gangs have their own system in this state for this test

 After 2003, CBI is again examining the AIIMS examination in 2017
 tippaniyan i know that these questions are not as important as the false accusations of politicians, but think that by paying money, become a doctor without studying and start treating you
 baat sirf doctor banane kaa nahin he, sarkaar ne janata kaa paisa ek aise chaatr par kharch kiya jo paise dekar chori ke raste se doctor bana he
 Once he becomes a doctor by way of theft, how will he follow the morality of the doctor

 The Supreme Court has asked the CBI to quickly file the charge sheet in all cases and submit the hard disk report to the CBI Trial Court of Bhopal

 The examination system of NEET MBBS and NEET PG is not completely theft free
 system aisa hona chahie ki afvaah kii bhi guzaaish na rahe or koi kisi ko thag nahin paae
 Seeing the clipping of newspapers, it seemed that gangs have their own system in this state for this test

 Once he becomes a doctor by way of theft, how will he follow the morality of the doctor
 is desh main raajnneetik kaarnon se vyapam ghotaale par thik se bahes nahin hui lekin honi chahie thi
 The Supreme Court has asked the CBI to quickly file the charge sheet in all cases and submit the hard disk report to the CBI Trial Court of Bhopal

 maharashtra ke kooparative sansthaaon par 40 varshon se chalaa aa rahaa sharad pavaar kaa ecchhatra raaj ab khatre main dikhaai de rahaa he
 Swabhimaan Shetkari Sangathan (SSS), run under the leadership of Raju Shetty, is an organization of farmers
 is sanghathan ne kisaanon ko ekajute kar nesanalist congress party (ensipi) ke adhyaksh ko hilaa diya he or unke rajnatik virdohi turat-phurat in shaktiyon ke saath ho gaye hai
 Raju Shetty is an Independent MP from Hatkangale
 maharashtra kii gramin arthvyavastha mukhya rup se kapaas, chini or doodh par aadhaarit he
 Pawar established his political empire in the 1970s by controlling cooperative milk unions, cooperative sugar, textile mills, district banks and the Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank (MSCB)
 emesasibi ek bada bank he, jo chini or anya milon ko karj detaa he
 For the first time, Pawar's grip on him is loosening
 khaskar pashchim maharashtra ke satara, pune, kolhapur, sholapur or sangli jilon main
 Pawar's strategic grip made him the surveyor of Maharashtra's sugar industry
 ko-oparative chini mil main ganna utpaadak shairdharak hote hai, lekin ek adhikrut prabandhan mil kaa sanchaalan karata he
 Generally, the chairman of a sugar mill has influence in the politics of at least two talukas around the mill
 kisaanon ko paisa muhaiyaa karaane vaale jila bank faisla karte hai ki kis kisaan ko karj diya jaae or kitna paisa diya jaae
 Over time, Pawar had installed his supporters in sugar mills and banks as the head and thus had a strong hold on the rural economy
 pavaar ke samrajya main pehali daraar 2004 main padi
 Shetty, who had successfully collected money from farmers to contest assembly elections that year, started wooing farmers by playing a card demanding increase in sugarcane rate
 unhone kisaanon se kaha ki milen shire se sharaab banaakar moti kamai karti hai, lekin unhen naam maatr kaa hi paisa detii hai
 The community of sugarcane farmers in Maharashtra is a powerful political group because this region alone produces one-third of the sugar in the country and more than 3 crore farmers are dependent on this industry
 shetty ne kisaanon ko ganne ke liye oonchi keemat die jane kii maang kii, jisase sarkaar ko majaboor hokar keemat 1,700 ru
 2,500 per ton to increase to Rs
 prati ton kerani padi
 After sugar, Shetty turned to milk
 yahaan bhi sarkaar ko doodh kii keemat 18 ru
 Increased from Rs 20 per liter to Rs
 prati litre kerani padi
 NCP chief Pawar once again lost some grip
 sitambar, 2011 main emesasibi ke liye ek prashaasak ke rup main mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan kii niyukti ne is bank par se ensipi ke shashan ko samaapt kar diya
 The party also suffered
 haalanki 2012 ke gram panchayat chunaavon main ensipi rajya main sabase badi party banakar ubhari, lekin pashchimi maharashtra main shetty kii party ‘swabhimani paksh’ kii vajah se use kaaphi siten ganvaani padin
 Shetty has since become Pawar's biggest enemy and people like bjp's Gopinath Munde and Pawar's disciple Pratapsinh mohit-patil have joined Shetty
 pavaar ne 13 november, 2012 ko pune main shetty ke khilaaf jatigat hamalaa tak shuru kiya
 Pawar said, "they (shetty) are making sure that the sugar mills of the people of their fraternity keep going and the sugar mills of other fraternities are closed
" ” lekin shetty avichlit bane rahe
 He told India Today, "my next target is Marathwada, where Pawar still has control over the co-operatives
" ”sankat kaa andaja lagaakar pavaar ne rajya main ensipi ke saat bade mantriyon se kaha he ki ve 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon kii taiyaari shuru kar den
 They will not field themselves, but will work to strengthen the party

 Around 1266, the king of Baisas, Karan Rai's son, Seedhurai, finally conquered this fort from the front
 vah bataate hai ki is kile par baison kaa kabja hone kii vajah se yah baisavaara naam se charchit hua or dondiakheda isaki rajdhani rahi
 He further states that in the Bais dynasty there was a glorious king named Trilokchandra
 unhone is kile ko na sirf sudrudh karaayaa, balki kile ke andar do mahal bhi banawaye, saath hi kile ke andar 500 sainik or kile ke baahar das hajaar sainikon kii tainaati bhi kii
 About King Trilok Chandra, he said that he was considered a very close associate of Bahlol Lodi, the emperor of the Delhi Sultanate
 trilokachandra ke kaal main hi kalapi, mainpuri se lekar pratapgarh jile ke manikpur or purv main baharich tak fail chukaa tha
 Saravan, a 90-year-old village elder, says that after the execution of Rao Rambakhsh Singh, the last king of the Bais dynasty, on 28 December 1857, the British commander Sir Hope Grant attacked him and destroyed it
 agar is kile ke bhugol ke bare main charchaa karen to uttar pradesh ke unnav jila mukhyalay se kareeb 33 kilometre dur dakshin-purv main 50 feet oonche mitti ke tile par yah kila bana hua he

 It is important to mention that neither the ASI nor any non-governmental organization (NGO) had come forward to preserve this fort before this historic heritage which has been converted into ruins

 atharah june ko dopaher baad, guwahati se amit shah ne jammu-kashmir ke prabharee or bhartiya janata party ke mahasachiv ram madhav ko bahut sankshipt phone kol kiya tha
 Shah said, "we need to discuss Kashmir
 kripaya jammu-kashmir rajya ke hamaare sabhi mantriyon ko dilli bulaaen
 i am returning to Delhi tonight
 ham kal baithak karenge
 On the other hand, in Srinagar, Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti got the news that the BJP high command has summoned his BJP colleagues to Delhi, then he had made several calls to the ministers to find out the reason, but they all kept their lips fixed
 agle din, mukhyamantri srinagar main sachivalay sthit apane karyaalay main lambit filein nipta rahi thim ki unke mukhya sachiv bharat bhushan vyas ne unhen governor en
 N
 vohara ke daftar se ek kol ke bare main bataaya
 Right now the BJP leadership was sending a message to the Governor that the BJP has decided to break away from the government of Jammu and Kashmir, almost when Ram Madhav informed this in a press conference with some ministers of the state in Delhi
 madhav ne kaha, "bhaajapa ke liye jammu-kashmir main gathbandhan sarkaar ke saath aage or bane rahanaa asambhav ho gaya he
 He blamed the PDP for ending the three-and-a-half-year alliance with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)
 puri kavayad main bahut saavdhaanee barti gai taaki yah tay kiya ja sake ki mahabuuba or unki party ko isaki bhanak bhi na lage or ve koi taiyaari bhi na kar saken
 Even Sajjad Lone, the MLA of the Jammu and Kashmir People's Conference, admitted that the party was going to take such a step that it was not even thought to be close to the top national leadership of the BJP and only on the insistence of the BJP in the government Was included as a minister
 pidipi-bhaajapa kaa saath lanbaa nahin chalane vaala he, yah andaja to sabko tha lekin yah itani jaldi hoga iskaa andaja na tha
 Surprisingly, it is in its time and the aspect that the BJP has distanced itself from the coalition, not the PDP
 gathbandhan ke donon saajheedaaron kii aapasi khatpat ko samajhen
 In July 2017, lashkar-e-taiba killed eight pilgrims from Gujarat and Maharashtra returning home after the Amarnath Yatra in a gruesome attack
 madhav kam se kam saarvajanik rup se to gathbandhan ko lekar ashaavadi bane rahe
 He told India Today in Delhi, "we will try to get the government to complete its term
 ''iske kuch maheene baad, jab is saal march main mahabuuba ne vitt mantri (or dilli ke saath madhyasth) haseeb drabu ko mantrimandal se barkhaast kar diya, to ise bhaajapa ko "kade sanket'' ke saath ghati main pidipi kii girti saakh ko bachaane kii jaddojahad kii tarah dekha gaya
 Then senior PDP leaders began to say openly that "the party (PDP) has lost credibility due to this alliance
" '' drabu kii jagah banaae gaye nae vitt mantri saiyad altaaf bukhari ne kaha, "hamaari party vichaardhaara ke saath samjhauta nahin karegi
 If such a situation comes, we will not hesitate to break the alliance
 ''to, phir pradhanmantri narendra modi or shah ko aisa kyon laga ki gathbandhan se pallaa jhaadne kaa vakt aa chukaa he?madhav ne dilli main samvaadadaataaon ko ise deshhit main liya gaya nirnay bataaya
 He said, "keeping in mind the larger national interest of the integrity and security of the country and the fact that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and given the current state of the state, the power should be handed over to the Governor
" halaat niyantrit karne kii jimmedaari rajyapal ko saunpny jaruri he isiilie hamane yah faisla kiya he
 The BJP general secretary said that a unilateral ceasefire was initiated by Delhi in the holy month of Ramadan but the militant and separatist camp did not show a "satisfactory attitude" about the initiative

 In a meeting with Kashmir ministers on June 10, Shah is said to have carried forward the "failed" alliance with the PDP in the state if it would prove to be a "tragedy" for the BJP at the national level
 bhaajapa adhyaksh ne unhen bataaya ki pidipi netritv (mahabuuba) centre kii ore se mil rahe bharpoor samarthan ke badale main santoshjanak pratikriya dene main asafal rahaa he, jisamen 16 may ko ghoshit ekatarfa yudhviram jaise prayaas bhi shaamil hai
 Insiders say that the decision was taken unanimously by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leadership in the context of imposing Governor's rule in Jammu and Kashmir
 may main pune kii ek baithak main vistaar se is par charchaa hui thi
 Senior Sangh workers at the meeting were of the view, "the leadership unanimously believes that the BJP workers across the country will be morally discouraged due to the alliance in Jammu and Kashmir
 '' ve is baat se sahamat the ki "yah gathbandhan 2019 tak jari rahata he to bhaajapa kii rashtravaadi chhavi puri tarah se matiamet ho jaaegi
 BJP leaders say that Mehbooba Mufti insisted on continuing the ceasefire in the name of restoring confidence in the people of the valley even after Ramadan passed, which created such an atmosphere of suffocation for the alliance that no one could pull back There was no way
 raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman, sena or ghati main tainaat anya surakshabalon ke virodh ke baavjood kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh ne 16 may ko ek maheene ke liye aatank virdohi karrwai par ekatarfa roak lagane kii ghoshnaa kar di thi
 He also appealed to start a new round of dialogue with all responsible parties in Kashmir, including separatist Hurriyat leaders
 lekin ek maheene main yah saaf ho gaya tha ki aatankwaadiyon ne is riyaayat kaa bharpoor phayda uthaaya
 Although the valley saw some reduction in stone pelting incidents, there were 62 terrorist attacks in the month of Ramadan, including 22 grenade attacks and 23 cases of indiscriminate firing by terrorists
 yudhviram se pehle ke maheene main aisi sirf 25 ghatnaayen hi dekhi gayi thim
 The separatists were also holding impossible pre-conditions to restore dialogue
 aresas netritv ko yah abhas ho rahaa tha ki is yudhviram se jahaan mahabuuba kii party ko rajnatik phayda ho rahaa he, vahiin raashtra-virdohi algaavvaadiyon ke prati kathor rukh rakhane kii bhaajapa kii rashtravaadi chhavi ko gaharaa jhatka lag rahaa he
 a BJP leader said, "continuing a ceasefire that did not see any positive benefit, the party would have suffered greatly at the national level
 ''lekin shaayad id se do din pehle 14 june ko patrkaar bukhari or rashtriya rifl ke sipaahi aurangzeb kii hatya ne shah ko yah faisla aanan-fanan lene ko vivash kar diya
 Both incidents were intended to damage peace restoration efforts in the valley

 Former Deputy Chief Minister Kavindra Gupta accuses Mehbooba of taking a "soft" stand in dealing with terrorism

 On January 27, several BJP leaders had also protested against the filing of a case against several jawans, including an officer, in a shooting incident at a huge mob of stonemasons in Shopian on 27 January
 kai bhaajapa netaaon kaa maananaa he ki jamaat-e-islamic evam anya kattarpathiyon ke prati mahabuuba bahut sahanubhuti or naram rukh dikhaati thim kyonki in sanghathanon ne 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main pidipi kii sahaayta kii thi
 Due to this attitude of the Chief Minister, terrorist organizations in the valley were able to recruit local people and establish their roots
 ve yaad dilaate hai ki july 2016 main hijbul commander burhan vaani ke maare jane ke baad mukhyamantri or unki party ke netaa bajaae rajya main bigadate halaat ko niyantrit karne kii gambhir koshishen karne ke, rahasyamay tareeke se aarope-pratyarope kaa khel khilne lage the
 Mehbooba had claimed that she had no idea that Wani was being targeted in the encounter and PDP MP Muzaffar Baig said that the security forces deliberately kept this information hidden from them
 beg to yahaan tak kah gaye ki surakshabalon ne muthbhed kii anivaary prakriya ko nazarandaaj kiya
 He should have tried to capture Vani alive instead of killing him in an encounter
 vishleshkon kaa bhi maananaa he ki dakshin kashmir main apni ghatati lokapriyata ko phir se hasil karne ke liye pidipi ne algaavvaadiyon or aatankwaadiyon ke prati naram ravaiya akhriyaar kar liya tha, jisase ghati main suraksha kii sthiti lagaataar badtar hoti ja rahi thi
 Clearly, the continuation of the ceasefire was not right, especially in the context of the upcoming Amarnath Yatra
 28 june se shuru hone vaali 40 din kii amarnath yatra main kareeb 3,00,000 hindu tirthayatriyon ke gupha mandir main vaarshik darshan ke liye aane kii ummid he
 a former army officer, who until recently was playing an important responsibility in the valley, said that "a government that becomes a hindrance in sharing the information collected by the state police with the army and paramilitary forces" Now it will be easier to deal with terrorist threats
 ''to, ab jammu-kashmir main aage kya hone vaala he? philhal sabhi mukhya rajnatik dalon—neshnal conference, congress or pidipi ne bhi kisi bhi vaikalpik gathbandhan kii sambhaavna ko khaarij kar diya he to rajya main rajyapal shashan kaa ek or charan shuru hoga

 pehali baar march, 1977 main raashtrapati shashan lagaaya gaya tha, jab mufti mohammad said kii adhyakshata main congress ne shaikh abdulla kii sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya tha
 The last time Governor's rule was imposed was in January 2016, when Mehbooba Mukrati kept the Chief Minister's chair vacant for three months after the death of her father
 19 june ko srinagar main press ko sambodhit karne se kuch der pehle, mahabuuba ne rajyapal vohara ko bataa diya tha ki "ham (pidipi) koi bhi doosraa gathbandhan banane kii koshish nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 Former Chief Minister and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah also ruled out any possibility of revisiting his old January 2015 proposal to support the pdp-led government in collaboration with the Congress
 umr ne saaf kiya ki ab rajyapal shashan hi ekmaatr vikalp he jisamen sthiti ko saamaanya karne ke baad jald se jald chunaav karaae jaaen
 The Congress also expressed a similar opinion
 rajya ke purv mukchaymantri or congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha, "hamaare liye bhaajapa or pidipi main ab antar nahin rahaa he
 However, the early elections Omar is talking about are unlikely at the moment
 ise aise samajhen—mahabuuba mufti dwaara april, 2016 main mukhyamantri banane ke baad dakshin kashmir ke anantnag seat se istipha die jane ke do saal biit chuke hai par vahaan loksabhaa upachunaav nahin karaayaa ja sakaa he
 Only 7 in the by-election for Srinagar seat in April 2017
 1 fisadi voting hui thi or chunaav ke dauraan hui hinsa main ek 15 saal ke schuli bachche samet aath log maare gaye the
 However, it is said that the Anantnag by-election was postponed simply because Mehbooba's PDP looked unlikely to save its old stronghold and was unwilling to face defeat
 lekin isi bich srinagar or jammu main ek teesri sambhaavna kii baaten bhi dabi jubaan se ho rahi hai
 In 2016, Mehbooba did not agree to sit on the Chief Minister's chair after her father's demise until she was confident of fulfilling key promises made in the coalition's shared agenda
 aisa bataaya jaataa he ki unki maangon se naakhush, bhaajapa netritv ne mahabuuba ko kinare karke pidipi ke 27 main se 22 vidhayakon ko is baat ke liye raji kar liya tha ki ve ek vaikalpik morcha banaakar bhaajapa ke saath nae sire se gathbandhan kii sarkaar banane ko aage badhen
 Governor Vohra had advised Prime Minister Modi and Shah that efforts to form a new government by removing Mehbooba from power could worsen the state of the state
 haalanki bhaajapa kii ore se bhi sarkaar banane kii koshishon ke koi sanket to dikhaai nahin dete lekin bhaajapa gathbandhan sarkaar banane kii ek or koshish karegi yaa nahin, pidipi netaaon kaa kahana he ki iskaa andaja to rajyapal ke faisle se hi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki vidhansabha ko bhang karte hai yaa nahin

 is image se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye ab sarkaar kai koshish kar rahi hai
 At present, the government has made it mandatory to clear dope test before admission in colleges
 yani ab nashe ke aadi yuvaaon ko sarkari college main daakhila nahin milegaa
 Earlier dope test was made compulsory in police recruitment
 nashe ke khilaafapunjab sarkaarrajya ke sabhi sarkari collejon main state level par ye muhim shuru karne ja rahi he
 With this, one will get to know the students who have been caught in the drug and the government's data will also be prepared that how many people are actually caught in Punjab
 iske liye hair ajukeshan vibhaag ne sarkari collejon main admician athwa ri-admician karwaane vaale yuvaaon kaa dope test karwaane kii yojana banaai he
 Currently feedback is being taken for this

 For this, help of Health Department will also be taken
 is prastaav kaa makasad nasha karne waalon kii pahchaan karke sehat vibhaag ke jariye unka ilaaj karwaanaa he
 It is feared that many kinds of drugs are being done on behalf of youth and children
 is sachai kaa pataa lagane ke sarkaar dope test kaa sahaara le rahi he
 Higher Education Minister Surjit Singh Rakhra in Punjab said that his department is preparing for this and it will be started from Mahindra College in Patiala
 unhone is maukey par kaha kii dope test world anti doping (waada) jaisi agency kii tarj par karwaae jaaenge
 There are 80,739 students studying in 48 government colleges in Punjab
 jinamein se 38695 ladke or 42044 ladkiyaan hai
 At the same time, there are 136 private aided colleges in the state of which around 1
 88 lakh student pard rahe hai, in collejon ko duusare charan main is dope test yojana main shaamil karne kii planning he
 However, such a large number of youth dope test is no less than a challenge

 In fact, just as on 2 April, there were violent protests in many states of the country to protest the change in the Dalit Atrocities Act and then on 10 April, there was violence in some parts of Bihar on the rumor of bandh in the name of protest against reservation from social media , In view of him, the UP police-administration was fully alert
 kisi bhi apriy ghatana yaa takaraav ko rokane ke liye saharanpur kii sadakon par bhi mangalvaar ko chappe-chappe par police bal tainaat tha
 The officer himself was ready
 aise main mangalvaar ko saharanpur shahar main hi sthit ek jagah se hombedkar kii murtikshtigrast hone kii soochna mili, to police-prashasan ke haath-pair phool gaye
 The idol was reported damaged from Shorowala Bagh, located in Madhav Vihar of Thana Mandi area of the city
 adhikari bina koi der kiye sarapat vahaan ke liye daude
 There he saw that one of the hands of Ambedkar's idol was damaged
 ab tatkaal murti ko badalawaanaa sambhav nahin tha
 There was a possibility of controversy and escalation as news of this spread
 aise main usee murti kii haathon-haath marammat kaa faisla liya gaya
 What was then, the policemen themselves became craftsmen
 haath ko murti ke kandhe ke saath joda gaya
 To stick the hand, someone started applying mud-mortar paste, some tied the hand with wire
 kisi tarah haath tikaa to phir us par geele main hi rang kii putai kii gai
 That means everything can be seen immediately
 haalanki jab ‘ajtak’ maukey par pahunchaa to bhi murti kaa haath tikaae rahane ke liye taar se bandhaa dikhaai diya
 The same argument was made by the police that the idol's palaster had collapsed by itself, which has been repaired and repaired

 According to Rajbal Singh, this idol was installed at this place in the year 1985
 police kii ore se yahi kaha ja rahaa he ki murti kaa plaster apane aap gira yaa use kisi ne kshatigrast kiya, in donon hi pahaluon ko lekar jaanch ho rahi he

 Currently the main gate of the plot is closed and no one is allowed to go there

 India vs Australia: Indian captain Virat Kohli feels that under World Cup preparations it would have been logical that his team would have played two more odis instead of two T20 Internationals
 bhartiya team australia ke khilaaf do tii-20 or paanch vanade khelegi jo paanch june ko southampton main dakshin africa ke khilaaf vishwa cap ke shuruuaati mukaable se pehle unki antim antarrashtriya siries hogi
 Kohli said on the eve of the opening T20, 'maybe, two more odis would have been beneficial not only for us but for both teams
 yah zyada adarsh or taarkik sthiti hoti
 'although these are T20 matches, Kohli would like to take these shorter format matches as World Cup preparations
 unhone kaha, ‘lekin hamaare paas jo bhi sarvshereshth cheez aage he, hamen uskaa upyog karnaa hoga
 As i have said earlier, we would like to be in a mentally sound position as a team
 ’pakistan se cricket par bole viraat kohli, hamaara rukh sakht, ham desh ke saath khadey hanunhone kaha, ‘abhi ham bataur team kaaphi santulit hai or mujhe kisi bhi cheez yaa vibhaag main koi chintaa nahin he
 Everything is almost solved
 ’ haalanki captain ne yah khulaasa nahin kiya ki leg spinner mayank markandeya ko yujavendra chahal par tarjeeh di jaaegi yaa nahin
 Chahal and Krunal Pandya are two specialist spinners of the T20 format
 kohli ne kaha, ‘dekhiye, use (markandeya) mauka diya gaya he, kyonki usne acha pradarshan kiya he
 This is purely to give a chance to the young player who has performed well in the last two seasons
 usne ipel or tii-20 cricket main acchhee gendbaaji kii
 The Indian captain described Australia's all-rounder Marcus Stoinis as the most dangerous player in the upcoming series

 The Lieutenant Governor of Delhi has given information about this by tweeting
 cabinet ne is maamle main faisla liya he
 Under this, all the cases registered under Section 81 will be withdrawn
 jin logon par dhara 81 ke tahat cese darj hai, unhen badi raahat milegi
 Also, 79 villages will be urbanized in Delhi
 dilli main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle modi sarkaar ne bada elaan kiya bhi kiya tha
 Union Minister Prakash Javadekar had announced that illegal colonies would be regularized in Delhi
 Major steps to implement PM-UDAY (PM- Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojna) approved today
 1
 Withdrawal of cases u / s 81 DLR act falling within the ucs
 2
 Urbanisation of 79 villages where ucs are located
 # housingforall — LG Delhi (@ltgovdelhi) November 20, 2019 According to the Delhi government, there are a total of 1,797 unauthorized colonies in Delhi
 in sabhi coloniyon main rahane vaale logon kocentre sarkaar ke is pahal kaa laabh milegaa
 These illegal colonies have gained legitimacy after the approval of the Center
 piem ne kiya tha vaadakendre kii antim manjuuri ke baad anadhikrut coloniyon main rah rahe logon ko apane gharon ke panjikaran kii ijaajat di jaaegi
 Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had recently met the residents of Delhi's unauthorized colonies
 unhone kaha tha ki dilli kii lagbhag 1,800 anadhikrut coloniyon ko 5 varshon se kii koshishon ke baad haal hi main niyamit karne kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 This decision will be implemented soon by enacting a law
 AAP ne di thi andolan kii chetavaneedelli main anadhikrut coloniyon kii vaidhata kaa mudda aam aadmi party bhi uthaati rahi he
 The Delhi government had recently claimed that only the Aam Aadmi Party can pave the raw colonies in Delhi, irrespective of the agitation from the road to Parliament
 aam aadmi party ke netaa raghav chaddha ne yah bhi kaha tha ki dilli main chunaav aate dekh bijepi ne kachi coloniyon ko pakkaa karne kii baat to kah di he lekin is maamle main na adhyadesh laae, na hi sheetakaaleen satr main vidheyak lekar aae
 This indicates that the BJP does not intend to legalize the colonies
 jab AAP ne vaidhata ko bataaya chunavi jumalaam aadmi party ne daawa kiya tha ki bijepi kaa yah vaada bhi ek chunavi jumala niklaa
 The party said that an all-party meeting is called before the session starts in which the PM, the Home Minister, the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs are there and the bills are discussed
 sarvadaleey baithak main 27 bilon kii suchi jari hui jisamen dilli kii kachi coloniyon ko niyamit karne kaa dur tak zikr nahin kiya gaya
 If they have not confirmed the raw colonies of Delhi, then we will raise our voice in the House, raise it on the street, raise it in the neighborhood
 puraa andolan hokar rahegaa
 But even before the agitation, the central government stamped on the regularization of illegal colonies
 aam aadmi party ise chunavi mudda nahin bana saki

 Asked what he meant by the right-wing fundamentalist, he said that he meant the religious fundamentalist group
 chidambaram ne kaha, ‘sandesh muhaavaron main khokar nahin rah janaa chahie
 Warning the efforts to radicalize the youth, Home Minister p Chidambaram said that recent facts have been revealed that 'saffron terrorism' has been involved in many bomb blasts in the past
 rajyon ke police mahanideshkon or police mahanirikshakon ke teen divasiy sammelan kaa 25 agast ko udghaatan karte hue chidambaram ne kaha tha, ‘bharat main yuvakon or yuvatiyon ko kattar banane ke prayaas band nahin hue hai

 court ne poocha ki kya ayog apana rukh badal rahaa he
 The EC told the Supreme Court that there is nothing wrong in electoral bonds, but the names of the donor should be made public as the people and the Election Commission have the right to know about the funding of political parties
