 World cricket will get a new Sartaj on the historic ground of Lord's today (on Sunday)
 ab bas dekhnaa yah he ki england or newjiland main se koun si team vishwa cap trophy uthaane ke lambe samay ke sapane ko saakaar kar paati he
 New Zealand have made the World Cup final for the second time, while hosts England have reached the final for the fourth time
 pichley vishwa cap main hi newjiland ne pehali baar final main kadam rakhaa tha lekin australia ne usko khitaab se maharoom rakh diya tha
 The English team lost to the Pakistan team, if it is seen then it has reached the final after 27 years
 1992 main usne graham gooch kii captaini main final khelaa tha, lekin imran khan kii captaini vaali pakistan ne use vijeta kii trophy nahin uthaane di thi or pehali baar champion banane kaa gaurav hasil kiya tha
 Now both have a chance to win the World Cup for the first time, but whose bag remains empty and whose part the trophy comes, it will be clear on match day itself
 australia or bharat ke baad england ke paas ye maukaek rochak tathy yah bhi he ki england ke paas teesri aisi team banane kaa mauka bhi he, jo mejabaan rahete vishwa vijeta bane
 India won the World Cup in their home in 2011, when it became the first team to win the World Cup in their hosting
 australia ne 2015 main ise doharaaya tha
 At the same time, after 23 years in world cricket, when no such team will win the World Cup, it has won earlier
 1996 main srilanka ne pehali baar vishwa cap jeeta tha
 Since then, no new world champions have been made since 2015 and the same teams have won the World Cup, which had won earlier, but this time history will change

 In the presence of Union Minister of State for Agriculture KV Thomas, Malayalam superstars Mammootty and Mohanlal and the dignitaries of the city, Bachchan made people laugh by repeating the proverb like 'peet vise karo se bahe bayar'

 Later in the conversation, Mammootty told Bachchan that he expected him to come in formal attire and that is why he also wore a suit
 is par bachchan kaa uttar tha ‚Äòpeeth waisi kijiye jaisi bahe bayaar‚Äô
 His response triggered a wave of laughter among the participants in the program

 New revelations have been made in the case of the death of 6-year-old Divyansha found dead at Ryan International School in Vasant Kunj, Delhi
 police sutron ke mutabik, divyansh puri tarah feet tha, jabaki skool ke principal ne use hyper active bataaya tha
 The doctors told Divyansh that according to the police sources, the doctors told him in his report that Divyansh was completely fit, he had no illness
 yah haadasa puri tarahaskool kii laaparvaahike chalate hua
 In the initial investigation by the police in the Ryan school case, the negligence of the school had already come to light, after which the school administration was continuously saying that the sentence was hyper active and that it would disappear from the class the next day
 vahin is ghatana ke baad mangalvaar ko jab skool khulaa to kai parents skool pahunche or unhone bhi bacchon kii suraksha ko lekar dar jataayaa
 The forensic team visited the school on Tuesday morning, the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) and the police team also arrived at the school and again the crime scene was recaptured
 abhi tak is maamle main 40 logon se poochtacha ho chuki he
 However, the attitude of the school in this case is shocking because the school has declared before the investigation of the incident that the sentence is hyper active
 jald hi ames ke doctoron kii team maukey kaa muyna karegi or jaanch karegi ki skool main medical kii kya vyavastha he
 The school also cited Divyansh's diary
 The school administration recently cited Divyansh's class diary in his defense
 diary main uski anushaasanheenata ko lekar darj noting ke jariye skool ne bachaav kiya he
 The police will further match the claims of the school staff with the doctor's statement in the case
 jaanch main juty police ko skool ke amphithieatre ke paas sisitivi camere nahin mili hai
 Footage of the school lobby has been found, based on which the action is proceeding
 isse pehle dausa main divyansh kaa antim sanskaar kar diya gaya
 Divyansh died on Saturday
 Divyansa, studying in first grade at Ryan International School, fell into the septic tank of the school on Saturday
 maamle main police ko pehali jaankaree skool prashasan kii bajaay aspataal se mili thi
 Innocent died when he was taken to the hospital
 abhi tak kii jaanch main jo baaten saamne ai hai, uske mutabik skool main jis jagah yah haadasa hua us water tanks ke paas chetavanee kaa koi board tak nahin tha
 Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj admitted that she is not at all shocked by the performance of the Aam Aadmi Party
 sushamaa ke mutabik mujhe dilli main under karant najar aa rahaa tha
 Without directly naming Arvind Kejriwal, he said that we had only expected that BJP would win 38-39 seats and form government
 phir vah boleen ki ham yahaan gadde main the or yah 33 siton kaa pradarshan bhi kam nahin he
 He hoped that after all the results came, it would be clear for the BJP to form a government
 janadesh kii ginati samajhaaii sushamaa nesushamaa swaraj ne chaaron rajyon main congress kii karaari haar ko numberon ke jariye bataaya
 He said that Congress has won a total of 137 seats by including all four states
 unhone kaha ki ise zyada siten to ham madhya pradesh or rajsthan main alag-alag jite hai
 Sushma said that elections were held for a total of 589 seats in the four states
 inamen 68 fisadi par bijepi jiti
 If you look at it from the perspective of Lok Sabha seats, then 65 seats in 72 are seen in bjp's account
 kya mahangaai or karpshan kaa asar rahaa janadesh parasushamaa ne kaha ki vyakti ke aadhaar par yaa kisi factor par chunaav nahin hua
 He said that there were issues of inflation and corruption, but more important were local issues
 unhone kaha ki dilli main bijli or pani ke bade hue rate bada mudda the or isse janata kitni gusse main thi, isse is baat se samajha ja saktaa he ki khud mukhyamantri shila dikshit chunaav haar gayi
 On the question of the credit of victory, Sushma Swaraj refrained from taking the name of anyone including Narendra Modi and said that the credit in our party goes to the collective leadership, goes to the public and goes to the party workers

 The Planning Commission has proposed to increase the price of petrol
 ayog kaa prastaav petrol ke daamon par green ses lagane kaa he
 It seems as if the government has started taking back the petrol price due to some other excuse

 Significantly, the oil companies had cut the prices of petrol twice in the month of November

 After his sudden arrest, the Aam Aadmi Party is calling it a conspiracy by the Lieutenant Governor and the Modi government
 party is masale par aar-paar kii ladaai ke mood main dikh rahi he
 a look at the five important questions that arose after Tomar's arrest
 1
 Why was there no permission from the assembly before the minister's arrest? The biggest question that has arisen on the arrest of Jitendra Tomar is why the police was in such a hurry
 mantri kii giraftaar karne se pehle vidhansabha se anumati leni hoti he or vidhansabha spikar ke aadesh ke baad hi giraftaar ho sakati he
 Tomar's arrest did not follow this rule
 2
 Delhi Police arrested, but Commissioner Nawakif? The statement of Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi is also not digestible that the police went without the knowledge of the state law minister to arrest him
 3
 Why was the ministerial privilege not followed? The constitution of the country gives certain privileges to persons sitting in constitutional posts
 us lihaaj se jitendra tomars ko apana paksh rakhane kaa paryaapt vakt milanaa chahie tha
 4
 giraftaar se pehle notice kyon nahin?police par yah sawaal uthaaya ja rahaa he ki usne giraftaar se pehle tomars ko notice kyon nahin diya
 Questions are being raised over the law minister's arrest without notice
 5
 Arrested on whose permission? After Jitendra Tomar's arrest, the question is being asked most prominently as to who did this arrest
 kyonki grih mantralay kah chukaa he ki uskaa isse koi lenaa-dena nahin he or dilli police kamishnar kii maane to unako to maamle kii jaankaree hi nahin he

 agsit pole bhi abaki baar ekamat nahin hai
 Two surveys are forming the Grand Alliance and four NDA governments
 yah to tay he ki nateezon ke bare main kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The way in which the competition of thorns is seen, it may also happen that one coalition misses a government by a margin of 4-5
 bahumat ke liye 122 siten jaruri hai
 If the Grand Alliance remains behind by a small margin, then Jitan Ram may prove to be the 'manjhi' of Nitish Kumar
 vaise bhi, agsit pole ke mutabik maanjhi ko mahadaliton ke 46 fisadi vot endie ko mili hai
 This is apparently due to Manjhi
 mahagathbandhan ko 35 fisadi or baaki 19 fisadi nirdaleeyon ko mili hai
 It is clear that Manjhi is going to emerge as a big force
 aise main unhen kamatar karke nahin aanka ja saktaa
 He will be in a position to form a government
 5 vajahen, jinase maanjhi dobaaraa nitish ke paas ja sakate hai
 1
 nitish kumaar maanjhi ke puraane saathi hai
 Nitish made him Chief Minister and he held this post for nine months
 haalanki unki raahen isi pad ko lekar alag hui thim, lekin yadi nitish unhen bulaate hai to dobaaraa maanjhi ke liye satta main jane kaa rasta saaf hoga
 2
 aarakshan bihar main bada mudda he
 It has also been an election issue
 is mudde par maanjhi or nitish ek hai, jabaki vah sangh ke vichaar ke khilaaf hai
 Bhagwat still maintains his statement of rethinking the reservation policy
 bijepi kii majaburiyaan vah bhi samajhate hai
 3
 bihar main mahadalit kii avadharana hi nitish ne di thi
 The entire mass base of Manjhi rests on this community
 nitish ne bihar main mahadaliton ke liye kaam bhi khub kiye hai
 That is, Manjhi and Nitish are closer to each other on the ideological plane
 4
 Manjhi will not have any immediate benefit if the NDA does not come to power
 bijepi ne maatr 20 siten dekar gathbandhan main unka kad pehle hi jaahir kar diya
 Only in future can there be an assurance from the governor of a state
 5
 If Manjhi stays in the role of a government, he can demand any position for himself
 aise main vah apni pehle vaali shaktishaalee sthiti main lautakar aa sakate hai
 In this sense, it will prove to be a profitable deal for Manjhi

 The media here has disclosed that two of the three wives of David Headley, who has an anti-indian sentiment, warned the FBI long before the Mumbai attacks, but the US said it shared information about the threat with India
 Was of a general nature
 pachaas varshiya hedli kii america patni ne uske pati ke lashkar e taiyaba se sambandh hone ke bare main 2005 main hi neuyork main epabiai ko bataa diya tha, jabaki uski morocco mul kii patni ne islamabad sthit america duutavas ke adhikariyon ko varsh 2008 ke mumbai hamalon se ek varsh se bhi kam samay pehle yah bataa diya tha ki pakistan mul kaa yah america aatankwaadi kisi hamale kaa shadyantr rach rahaa he
 'the New York Times' reported,' Despite two of three wives being warned, Headley roamed freely for Lashkar between 2002 and 2009
 usne chote calibur hathiyaar chalaane, javaabi nigaraanee karne, hamalon ke liye toh lene or chicago se lekar pakistan kii arajak pashchimottar seemaa tak sampark tantra sthapit karne kaa prashikshan hasil kiya
 "if we knew the timing of the Mumbai attacks and other specific information, we would have shared such details with the Indian government immediately," said Mike Hammer, spokesman for the US National Security Council at the White House
 ‚Äô unase janhit main khoji patrakarita karne vaale alaabhakaari swatantra sanghathan ‚Äòpropublica‚Äô kii beete shuukravaar mumbai hamalon ke bare main di gayi khabar ke bare main poocha gaya tha
 The New York Times also reported that two of the three wives of 50-year-old Headley had US agencies having links with lashkar-e-taiba and the US agencies less than a year before the 2005 Mumbai attacks
 Warned about plotting to attack Mumbai
 haimer ne kaha ki america ne varsh 2008 main mumbai hamale hone se pehle bhartiya adhikariyon ko khataron se sambandhit jaankaree niyamit taur par muhaiyaa karaayi thi
 He said that it is the responsibility of our government to inform other countries about possible terrorist activities on their land
 america ke ek anya adhikari ne is baat kaa khandan kiya ki america ne bhartiya prashasan ke saath kisi aatankwaadi hamale ke bare main jaankaree saajha nahin kii thi
 a senior US administration official said, "the American administration took seriously what Headley's former wives told
 unki di gayi jaankaree kii prakruti saamaanya thi or usase kisi vishisht aatankwaadi shadyantr ke sanket nahin milte the
 However, an Indian source involved in the investigation of the Mumbai attacks told the Press Trust on condition of anonymity that India had received the information but that it was general in nature and did not mention anything specific
 khabar kahati he, ‚Äòhedli kii morocco mul kii 27 varshiya patni faija outalha ne daawa kiya ki usne (islamabad sthit america) duutavas ke adhikariyon ko taj mahal hotel main lee gayi hedli kii or uski tasviir bhi dikhaayi jahaan ve donon april or may 2007 main tehre the
 The hotel records confirm their stay there
 ‚Äôfaija ne kaha ki islamabad sthit america duutavas main america adhikariyon ke saath hui uski do mulakaaton ke dauraan usne bataaya tha ki uske pati ke kai aise mitra hai jo lashkar e taiyaba ke pramukh sadsy hai
 According to the news, "he (faiza) said that he had told that he (headley) is very anti-india, but he traveled to India many times for business agreements but he never seemed to give him much attention
 ‚Äòda neuyork times‚Äô kii khabar kahati he ki wadamaf gavaah banane ke liye hue saude ke tahat apane upar lage aatankwaad se sambandhit sabhi 12 aaropon ko sweekaar kar chuke hedli ko pakistani or america suraksha adhikari uski giraftaar se kaaphi pehle bataur aatankwaadi jaanate the
 According to the news, based on an investigation into the activities of Headley, a pakistani-american terrorist of the year prior to the Mumbai attacks, and based on interviews conducted in Washington, Pakistan, India and Morocco, reports suggest that Headley apparently had different groups from each other That is, mutual but confusing contacts with Pakistani intelligence agencies, terrorists and US anti-drug investigators Area
 faija ne america adhikariyon ko yah bhi bataaya ki hedli kii alag-alag pahchaan thi
 When he was in Pakistan, his name was Dawood and he appeared to be a religious Muslim and when he was in India his name was David, an American playboy
 faija ne akhbaar ko bataaya, ‚Äòmaine unase (america adhikariyon se) kaha ki vah yaa to aatankwaadi he yaa vah aapke liye kaam karata he
 He indirectly told me that i should get away from there
 ‚Äôamerica ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki faija kii america afasaron se mulaakaat is bare main hui thi ki uskaa pati ‚Äòkharaab logon‚Äô kii sangat main he or ve log ‚Äòjihad‚Äô chhedane kii sajeesh rach rahe hai
 The officer said, "but he did not give information about who is involved or what is on their target
" ‚Äôudhar, faija ne kaha, ‚Äòunka (america adhikariyon kaa) dhyaan akshirt karne ke liye maine sab kuch kiya
 It was like i am screaming that this person is a terrorist and you have to do something
 ‚Äô‚Äòda neuyork times‚Äô kii khabar sanket detii he ki america adhikariyon ke chetavaniyon ko nazarandaaj kar dene kaa kaaran yah ho saktaa he ki ve jaanch ko us disha main le jane se bachanaa chaahate hon jo hamalon main america ke ahm sahyogi pakistan kii sanliptata ke saboot detii ho
 The ISI has denied its involvement in the attacks
 akhbaar ke mutabik, ‚Äòamerica ne kaha he ki (iesai ke khandan ke) jawaab main uske paas koi saboot nahin he
 However, officials acknowledge that some current or retired officers of the ISI may have some role in the attacks
 ‚Äôkhabar kahati he ki chetavaniyon par karrwai nahin hona aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main soochnaaon ke aadan pradaan se sambandhit khami ho sakati he or isse ye sawaal bhi khadey hote hai ki kya america adhikariyon ne hedli ke nasha nirodhi pravartan prashasan (diie) kaa mubir hone ke chalate is sambandh main adhik tafteesh nahin kii

 Sanjay Singh appealed to the workers to maintain peace in every situation

 The monsoon rains have blossomed the faces of the farmers and its clear effect is also visible on crop sowing
 is baar 22 july tak kharif fasalon kii buvaai kaa rakabaa pichley saal ke mukaable takreeban 22 lakh hectare zyada rahaa
 According to the latest figures of the Ministry of Agriculture, this time 692 all over the country in the Kharif season
 98 lakh hectare ke rakabe main buvaai darj kii gai he
 Sowing of Kharif crop is the biggest reason behind this time of the year, despite the low rainfall in June, the rains in July
 saamaanya ke mukaable 35 fisadi zyadaais baar monsoon sijan main july ke pehle 15 dinon main barish saamaanya ke mukaable 35 fisadi zyada rahi or iskaa bahut hi sakaaratmak asar desh kii krishi par dekha gaya
 In the month of July, the process of hot rain is still going on
 kharif sijan kii mukhya fasal dhan he or isaki monsoon par nirbharta kaaphi had tak he
 This time, sowing of paddy in the country was 182 last year
 38 lakh hectare ke mukaable 183
 Has been 06 lakh hectares
 yani dhan utpaadak rajyon main buvaai ne jor pakad liya he
 Sowing of paddy production will increase and production will be better this time
 isaki vajah ye he ki is baar agast or sitambar main monsoon kii barish pichley kai saalon ke mukaable zyada rahane kaa anumaan he
 Kharif sowing of coarse grains is also about 3 this time compared to last year
 5 fisadi badhkar 130
 80 lakh hectare has been grown
 sarson or moongfalee jaisi tilhan fasalon kaa buvaai rakabaa bhi kharif sijan ke dauraan pichley saal ke mukaable 4
 149 increase by 28 percent
 16 lakh hectare ho gaya he
 Action will be taken on the brokers, so the prices of pulses will decrease
 Talk about the oilseeds
 This year, its sowing area has seen a strong increase
 pichley saal 22 july tak daalon kii buvaai 64
 There was 69 lakh hectares of area
 lekin kharif sijan main is baar dalhan fasalon kaa buvaai rakabaa 39
 39 percent to 90
 17 lakh hectare rahaa he
 This simply means that the visible rise in prices of pulses at this time may be due to hoarding and other reasons
 agar sarkaar jamokhoron or dallalon ke khilaaf kadam uthaae to daalon kii keemton main narmi aane kii puri sambhaavna he
 If we trust the data of the Ministry of Agriculture, the effect of the best monsoon is clearly visible on the sowing in the Kharif season
 isse yaheen kaha ja saktaa he ki is baar kharif fasalon kaa utpaadan pehle se kaaphi behatar rahane kii sambhaavna he
 Republic Day 2019: The entire nation is celebrating 70th Republic Day on 26 January 2019
 jahaan desh ke raashtrapati ramnath kovind ne rajpath par tirangaa fahraayenge
 When it comes to the country, forgetting everything, the whole country colors the national flag in three colors of the tricolor
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki bharat ke tirange kii kahani, kaise bana hamaara rashtriya dhvaj
 Today we are telling you the full story of the tricolor
 bhartiya rashtriya dhvaj ko iske vartmaan swaroop main 22 july 1947 ko yojit bhartiya samvidhan sabha kii baithak ke dauraan apanaaya gaya tha, jo 15 agast 1947 ko angrejon se bharat kii swatantraaa ke kuch hi din purv kii gai thi
 It was adopted as the national flag of India between 15 August 1947 and 26 January 1950
 bataa den, tirange kaa dizin andhrapradesh ke pingali vankaiya ne banaaya tha
 Pingali Venkaiah: Because of which India got the tricolor
 
 
 tirange ne badale itane rangarashtra dhvaj teen rangon se milakar bana he- jisamen kesaria, safed or hare rang he
 Let me tell you, even before the national flag which is present, many national flags have been formed
 saal 1921 main pingali venkaiya ne kesaria or haraa jhanda saamne rakhaa tha
 Then Lala Hansraj of Jalandhar added it and Gandhiji suggested to add white bandage
 pehla dhvajasbase pehle laal, pile or hare rang kii horijontal pattiyon par bane jhande ko 7 agast 1906 ko parsi bagan chowk (green park), kolkata main fahraaya gaya tha
 Second Flag The second flag was hoisted in Paris in 1907 by Madame Cama and some revolutionaries who were evacuated with her
 yah bhi pehle dhvaj kii tarah hi tha
 The seven stars on the strip at the top indicated the Saptarishi while there was a lotus
 teesraa dhvajatisraa dhvaj saal 1917 main dow
 Annie Besant and Lokmanya Tilak hoisted it during the domestic rule movement
 is dhvaj main 5 laal or 4 hari kshaitij pattiyaan ek ke baad ek or saptrushi ke swaroop main is par bane saat sitare the
 There was a Union Jack on the top edge on the left and a white crescent and star on the top edge on the right
 modi ne saal main 2 baar laal kila par fahraaya tirangaa, kai PM ko mauka tak na milachauthaa dhvajchauthaa dhvaj akhil bhartiya congress kamity ke satr ke dauraan 1921 main bejwada main fahraaya gaya tha
 It was made up of two colors red and green which represented both Hindu and Muslim communities
 gandhi ji ne yah suzav diya tha ki bharat ke baaki kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye isamen ek safed pattee or ek chalata hua charkha hona chahie
 The fifth flag, the fifth flag, was hoisted in the year 1931
 yah dhvaj bhartiya rashtriya sena kaa sangram chinh bhi tha
 At the same time we have already told you that saffron, which came on 22 July 1947, adopted the white and green colored flag
 jiske bichon-bich iske bichon bich ashok chakra bhi bana he jisamen 24 tilliyaan hoti hai
 The tricolor was adopted by the Indian National Congress shortly before India became independent

 The 10 agencies also include large security agencies like CBI, IB, NIA
 is adhisuchana ke baad bavaal much gaya tha
 The opposition attacked the government and called it an attack on the right to privacy
 is adhisuchana par congress netaa anand sharma ne kaha tha ki sarkaar kaa yah aadesh moulik adhikaron ke khilaaf he
 According to the decision of the Supreme Court on this, this privacy is your fundamental right
 niztaa ke adhikaar par yah aadesh chot pahunchaata he
 This has also posed a great threat to democracy
 vahiin samaajawaadee party ke ram gopal kaa kahana tha ki sarkaar kaa yah aadesh khatarnaak he

 bijepi ke khilaaf upie gathbandhan majbootee se chunaav ladega
 This UPA leader will decide who should be the Prime Minister
 ham bijepi nahin hai ki ek aadmi ko puure desh par thope diya jaae
 But Rahul Gandhi country should become the Prime Minister of the country, he is 100 percent ready for this, says Congress MP and Madhya Pradesh campaign incharge Jyotiraditya Scindia
 vah agenda ajtak main rajdeep saradesai ke sawaalon kaa jawaab de rahe the
 Scindia said that Rahul Gandhi has the ability to take the country forward
 vah garibon or majaluumon kii aawaaj ban sakate hai
 He understands the pain of farmers
 jyotiraditya ne kaha ki teen pradeshon ke jo chunaav hue hai vah bijepi banaam janata hue hai or 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav bijepi banaam desh kii janata honge
 He hoped that the UPA would succeed in ousting the BJP from power in the Lok Sabha elections
 upie chunegaa netamodi banaam koun ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki upie gathbandhan kaa netaa upie chunegaa, upie kii adhyaksh sonia gandhi hai
 This decision will be taken after consultation with every leader of the coalition
 yah chunaav ke pehle hoga yaa baad main yah abhi nahin bataaya ja saktaa
 But according to me, Rahul Gandhi should be the PM of the country, he has the ability to take the country forward, he is ready for 100%
 is sawaal par congress adhyaksh jyotiraditya sindhiya yaa sachin payalat kyon nahin ho sakate
 Scindia said that Congress is a democratic party and elections are held from the panchayat to the top, who has stopped Scindia from fighting
 lekin meri raay he ki rahul gandhi hamaare netaa hon to isamen kisi matbhed kii baat nahin he
 Unhappy about not being made CM, Scindia said that there is no ambition of everyone, but can the public be served only after getting a post
 agar janata kii seva kaa sankalp ho to bina pad ke bhi kii ja sakati he
 He said that he is happy to have Kamal Nath as CM and his party has given him a lot

 ‚Äô raajaguru yah sun hatprabh ho gaye or phir kam-se-kam sardaar ko to ve baad main kabhi shero-shaayari kaa rasaswadan nahin karaate the
 But he was fond of remembering lions
 uske baad ve in logon ke saath kabhi taj dekhne bhi na gaye
 When the number of members increased, there would be the problem of muffling along with food
 tab azaad akhbaar bicha apni dhoti odh usee main raat kaat dete
 Whoever got Bhagat and Sukhdev Dari or blankets would have to cover it
 neeche sabake hi akhbaar bichhe rahete
 Some cold was saved from the top, but from the bottom, the news had to be satisfied
 jab paise hote to sabere naashte kii ‚Äòaiyashi‚Äô kar lete
 Everyone used to get one each
 kuch log utane paise main kachaudee laakar naashtaa karte or kuch chaay banaate
 At times Bhagat and Sukhdev would have joined tea, but Azad never joined
 din bhar main bhojan banataa
 All were made in turn, but Ranjit (bhagat Singh) would say- "I will not join it
" ‚Äô‚Äô ve sabake kapade dho dete
 Sukhdev would often share his hand in this
 unki anupasthiti main ham main se kisi ko le jate
 One day i too was supporting him in this work
 kapade dhote samay ve mujhe ireland ke swatantrata aandolan kii ghatnaayen sunaate rahe
 Sometimes songs were also programmed in which Hindi, Marathi, Bengali songs were sung
 marathi kaa ‚Äòraja kuthe gutla‚Äô ‚Äòsakhye to praan maajha‚Äô bahut prachlit tha
 The background of this song is that Veeramgati has attained on the battlefield and Uttara is mourning for her heroic husband
 uski dhun bhi itani madhur thi ki shabdon kaa arth purna rup se na samajhane par bhi logon ko yah virahagiit bahut pasand aata tha
 a peaceful atmosphere was created by singing
 geet samaapt hone par bhi kuch kshan stabdhta rahati
 I, Bhagwan Das and Vijay were among the singers
 bhagat singh kabhi-kabhi masti main gaate the
 Mera Rang De Basanti Chola and Heer
 unki aawaaj bahut sureeli thi
 They did not know the limits of tone, rhythm or rhythm
 ham sabamein villager (sukhdev) in sab maamalon main aurangzeb the
 If he were singing, he would listen with a meaningless voice because there was no other choice
 azaad ko gaanaa acha lagata tha par ve sangeet se adhik uske shabdon ke aashiq the
 Sometimes he would start a line of some Bundelkhandi poem and then say to me or Bhagwan Das - 'sing it if you sing
 ‚Äô antim dinon main jab ekaant main baith vichaaron main atyadhik ulajh jate to kehete ‚Äògaanaa gaao‚Äô or aise samay ‚Äòmaan hamen vidaa do‚Äô geet ve gavaate or saath dete
 At the end of the song, as if the song's rasadhara would wash away the sadness of all his brain
 kabhi ranjit kaa samaran karte-karte ve ga uthte, ‚Äòmeraa rang de basanti chola
 He used to sit silently while singing
 phir ek lambi saans lekar kehete, ‚Äòagre ke din bhi kya din the!‚Äô- phir maun ! maano us vaataavaran main phir kho gaye hon
 Then laughing and mustache started whipping
 maano phir kuch drudh sankalp kar baithe hai, british shaskaon se badale kaa sankalp
 Eyes would shine
 anek baar itane par bhi man shant na hota to kehete, ‚Äòchalo bachchan, ghoomane chalem
 'both of them walk with two unknown strangers
 dhire-dhire shaam ho jaati, andheraa failane lagata to ghar laut aate or anek baar is mood main hone par bina khaae hi so jate
 Azad was the commander of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Army
 par pad ke abhimaan main unhone kabhi apane ko apane saathiyon se bhinn nahin samajha
 In laughter and fun, everyone would wrestle with friends, but during the action, the order of Azad was Brahmavakya
 vichaar-vinium ke samay sabhi apana-apana drushtikon rakhte, parantu nirnay ho jane par sabhi nirnay ko shirodharya maanate
 Azad himself strictly followed the decision of the party
 asembli bamkand kaa nirnay iskaa pramaan he
 His idea was that after throwing bombs in the assembly, bhagat-dutt should come out
 azaad ne daawa kiya tha ki ve unhen surakshit le aayenge
 With this view, Azad also inspected the assembly building, but the majority was not in this favor
 vishesh rup se, sardaar bhagat singh is baat par bal de rahe the ki vahaan krantikariyon ko aatmasamarpan karnaa hi chahie, jise ve ‚Äòpropaganda bai dead (prachaar kaa sakriy tarika) kaha karte the
 In this work, where the party was promoted all over the world, there was a huge loss in terms of the organization of the party
 aage sambhavtah jo hua vah dal kii bhuulon kaa hi parinaam tha
 Till the assembly bombings, the police could not find out who was involved in the murder of the Sanders; But only after that such sources were found which helped the police to catch the members of the party
 sardaar bhagat singh ke paas asembli main jo pistal tha usee kaa upyog sanders hatyakand main hua tha
 So the police immediately mixed the bore of that pistol and it came to the conclusion that the pistol of this bore was used in the murder of Saunders
 police ne yah maanakar ki bhagat singh usamen the, inke saathiyon kii khoj prarambh kar di

 GVL Narasimha said, ‚Äúthe statement of the CM of Rajasthan is anti-dalit
 ham log maang karte hai ki gahalot ji maafee maangen
 Gehlot has said that Kovind should become president because he comes from the Dalit community
 ham maang karte hai ki chunaav ayog gahalot ko notice jari kare
 "later Ashok Gehlot tweeted," It is very unfortunate that some media persons misrepresented my statement during the press conference
 bhartiya raashtrapati kaa main behad sammaan karata hum or shri ramnath ji kaa nijee taur se bhi, jinase main mil chukaa hum or unki saadagi or vinamrata se bahut prabhavit hum
 "by the way, this dispute that has arisen in the midst of the Lok Sabha election campaign will end soon, there is no hope of it at the moment

 bhubaneshwar se kareeb 60 kilometre dur puri
 When you start your journey from Bhubaneswar towards Puri, you will get the most hoardings of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on both sides of the road
 kahin ped ke peeche pradhanmantri aap ko dekhte hue nazar aaenge to kahin pillar ke upar
 In the matter of publicity, Naveen Patnaik also tried to compete with the Prime Minister, but was behind
 bijepi ke har hording main pradhanmantri alag-alag andaaj main alag-alag vaade ke saath najar aa rahe hai
 Somewhere they are talking about the farmers and some other women
 bijepi ke zyaadaatar hording main akele pradhanmantri hi hai, kahin kahin sambit paatra chandan or kesari ke saath pradhanmantri se haath milaate hue milenge
 But if someone enters Odisha suddenly and does not know who is contesting the elections in Puri, he will surely think once if the Prime Minister is contesting from Puri
 It is not just about Puri, Kendrapada, Bhubaneshwar, Cuttack, the same situation in most places
 poster or binar par congress ne bahut kam paisa kharch kiya he
 If you get three to four hoardings of Congress in the 60 km journey from Bhubaneswar to Puri, then it is a big deal that in this hoarding, Rahul Gandhi will look very young in a clean save
 prachaar ke maamle main odisha ke chunaav se congress puri tarah baahar nazar aati he
 Narendra Modi's popularity was seen by the people when the Lok Sabha elections were in 2014, but in 2014, neither was there much discussion of Narendra Modi nor did the BJP get more seats
 21 main se bijepi sirf ek seat jeetne main kaamyaab hui thi lekin is baar log pradhanmantri modi kii baat kar rahe
 There will be increase in BJP seats but it is difficult to say how many seats BJP will get
 puri main ladaai dilachasp he
 Sambit Patra is working very hard
 sambit puri ke rahane vaale nahin he
 He does not have much relationship with the people of Puri
 isiilie sambit yahaan logon ke saath rishta jodne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The relatives eat anywhere, enter into someone's house
 nahaane ke liye kabhi-kabhi talab kaa istemaal bhi kar lete hai
 Most of the time, people go out in publicity by putting sandalwood and kesari on their foreheads
 puri jane ke baad sambit ne suut pahanane lagbhag chhod diye hai
 Seen in a dhoti
 isaki yah vajah he ki puri ke panda voters ko lubhaane main lage he
 Sambit Patra is meeting Telugu people living in Puri, singing Telugu songs, giving speeches in Telugu
 sambit paatra piem ke naam par vot maang rahe hai
 Balakot and Pakistan are also being used in election rally speeches
 narendra modi ko dobaaraa piem bananaa he yah baat bijepi logon ko samajhane main lagi he
 There is also a charm in Puri's BJP office, there are different vehicles with cycles for campaigning
 lekin yah raunak puri ke bijedy offis main dekhne ko nahin milegi
 bjp's organization has strengthened in the area around the city of Puri, but the BJP needs more work in the village right now
 gaanv ke zyadattar matadaatapinaki ke saath he
 Pinaki is behind Sambit in all this but there is local support with Pinaki
 pinaki pichley das saalon se yahaan se saansad hai
 Also won from Congress seat here in 1996
 logon kaa kahana he ki pinaki logon se kam milte hai
 Just as the concerned PM is seeking votes by putting forward, similarly, more BJD candidates are seeking votes in the name of Naveen
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki aaj bhi log naveen ko paanchavin baar siem banane chaahate hai
 People are very happy about the rice that Naveen has given people for one rupee
 logon ke man me ek yah bhi dar he kahin naveen chale jane ke saath chaaval milanaa band na ho jaye
 People have respect for Naveen in his days, Pinaki will benefit puri main drenez kii samasya ko lekar log pareshaan he
 People say that a little rain fills the way
 puri main jameen mafia ko lekar bhi log pareshaan hai
 But seeing the crowd of people at the road show of Pinaki Mishra, it seems that for the third time Pinaki is going to win the election with a BJD ticket
 puri ke congress ummidavaar kii bhi log charchaa kar rahe hai lekin puri main congress ne prachaar main koi paisa nahin kharch kiye
 Rahul Gandhi has not done any roadshow in Puri yet
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah puri main road sho kar chuke hai, odisha ke siem naveen patnayak bhi bijedy ke taraf se hue road sho main shaamil hue the
 The Congress probably assumed that it was out of the Odisha elections
 puri main jab sambit ke saath ghoomte hai to lagata he sambit jeetenge or jab pinaki kii raily main bheed dekhte he to lagata he pinaki jeetne ja rahe hai
 But whoever won is a battle of prestige
 agar yahaan sambit jitkar aate hai to jeet piem kii hogi or agar pinaki jeetenge to jeet naveen kii hogi
 Because more candidates are being contested in the name of PM and CM

 bhartiya cricket team ke purv captain mohammad ajaharuddin ne kaha he ki mahendra singh dhoni test kii captaini main kamatar sabit ho rahe hai
 According to Azhar, Dhoni is definitely the best captain in terms of ODI and Twenty20 cricket but he lacks the kind of cleverness needed in Test matches
 ajahar ke mutabik dhoni test maichon ke dauraan turant faisle bhi nahin le pate hai
 Mohammad Azharuddin has also said that there should be different captains for Team India in all three formats of ODI T20 and Test cricket
 australia, england or dakshin africa ne cricket ke alag-alag formet ke liye alag alag captain banaaya hua or lambey samay se bharat main bhi iske liye maang uth rahi he

 Australia, England and South Africa have made different captains for different formats of cricket and for a long time there has been a demand in India as well
 ajahar ke mutabik isse kisi ek khilaadi par dabaav bahut zyada nahin hoga

 purv mukhyamantri bies yediurppa par bhrashtachar ke aarope lage the
 He is no longer in the party

 If the BJP comes back to power, it will be the next Chief Minister of the state
 'bijepi adhyaksh is dauraan centre kii upie sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhane kii mauka nahin chuke
 He said, 'in the last 9 years, the UPA has been completely engulfed in scams
 vah desh ko suraaj dene main naakaam rahe hai
 Now, if the 2G case is taken, the JPC has made a report ignoring the statement of the main accused a Raja

 motorola ne pichley maheene bharat main bajet smartphone Moto G6 Play launch kiya he
 We have used this smartphone for a long time and this is the right time to tell you how this smartphone performs and whether you should buy this smartphone
 aap ise phul rivyuu kah sakate hai
 In this review, you will read whether this smartphone is successful in maintaining the legacy of Moto g series or where it stands in front of other devices in terms of flop design, build quality, look and feel
 is? How fast is this smartphone? How is multi tasking, where does this phone stay in gaming
 
 Et cetera et cetera
 
 What is the power of the Moto G6 Play camera? What has it done in the battery department? Let's go review design, build quality (look and feel) At first glance, this smartphone looks beautiful
 glass back kii vajah se dekhne main ye behatar lagata he
 This phone is a bit heavy, but the company has been making durable phones, so people understand the logic behind it
 is baar company ne sahi jagah par fingerprint scinar diya he
 There is also a fingerprint scanner on the rear panel, exactly where the Motorola logo is dimple
 company ko yah kaam kaaphi pehle karnaa chahie tha, kyonki hameshaa se motorola kii branding yani logo rier panel par bane camere ke neeche ek dimple main hota he
 But for the first time when the company provided a fingerprint scanner in Moto G, it was in the front which was quite disappointing
 chaliye company ne der se hi sahi, lekin is baar kaam dhang kaa kiya he
 The camera is bump round and the LED flash light is given just below the camera
 chaaron kinaaron ko round yani karvd dizin diya gaya he
 It can say that the phone is curved backwards
 bottm main USB 2
 0 is given while the headphone jack is in the top
 front main disple kii ke neeche motorola kii branding he or upar bain taraf front camera he or dayee taraf elidi flash lite he
 The build quality is solid and the feel is also good
 ek haath se ise yuj karnaa kaaphi aasaan he
 So many people may like this
 is maamle main hamen bhi yah smartphone pasand aayaa he
 5 in this smartphone 7 inch kii screen di gai he, aspect reshyo 18:9 kaa he or iskaa rijolushan 720X1440 he
 The company has brought this aspect ratio late when a lot of smartphones have already come in such markets
 disple ke liye do mod hai standard or vivad inamen se aap kisi ek ko select kar sakate hai
 The viewing angle is correct and the display is bright, especially when you use it by setting a vivid color
 britaness bhi thik he suraj kii raushnee main aap aasaani se disple ke contant dekh yaa pard sakate hai
 The display is not revolutionary but good and does not hurt the eyes
 gaming main bhi isaki parformens sahi he
 Performance Moto G6 Play has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor which 1
 4ghz kii speed detaa he
 This processor is budget and is usually offered in cheap smartphones
 is segment ke lihaaj se company isamen doosraa procesar lagaati to zyada behatar hota
 However, sometimes the performance of a smartphone does not depend on the processor only, because it has many factors that you have to understand
 bharat main yah smartphone 3GB ram or 32GB internal memory verient main hi uplabdh he
 Memory can be increased up to 128GB via micro SD card
 score or benchmark kii baat karen to yah apane segment main bottm par he
 However real life performance is fine
 gaming kii baat karen to is par thik thaak he or Asphalt jaise game bina lag ke khel sakate hai
 Multi-tasking is fine and switching from one app to another is easy
 blottware na hone kii vajah se yah fast bhi he
 The company has its own software through which you can enable gesture support
 iske alaava motorola ke duusare fitures jaise camera open karne ke liye twist karnaa or flash lite ke liye chop karnaa
 These are handy features and also easy
 yujar interphes clin he, kyonki is par koi skin yuj nahin kii gai he
 The company has Android 8 in it
 0 diya he
 Always on display has done a lot of work and this company is already giving it
 ek nayaa feechar Moto Key he jiske tahat fingerprint ke jariye password enter kar sakate hai
 Camera Moto G6 Play has a 13-megapixel rear camera, which has an aperture f / 2
 0 he
 For selfie, it has an 8 megapixel wide angle lens, which has an aperture f / 2
 2 he
 In this range, however, companies are offering dual rear or selfie cameras
 phir bhi dekhte hai camera parformens main kahaan tikta he ye smartphone
 It makes average photography in outdoor and light
 lekin kam raushnee or indoor photography main is smartphone main hamen niraash kiya he
 Detailing also does not make any sense and the photos look very bad to zoom
 video record karne main agar aapkaa haath hilaa to kaaphi shaike karte hue video banati he
 Comobesh is also similar with a selfie camera
 thodi si raushnee kam ho gai tasveeron main grence dekhne ko milenge, haalanki yahaan flash lite kaam karata he, lekin sirf aapke chehre tak ke liye hi
 With this you can record full HD video from 30 frames per second and this feature is available in both cameras
 softwareenoto G6 Play main Android Oreo 8
 0 has been given and Android p will also be updated in it
 yujar interphes stock android (niyar stock android) jaisaa hi he isamen motorola ke kuch eps milte hai jo pre loded hai
 Clean software has been a specialty of Motorola and speed is also affected due to lack of custom skin
 bydareenoto G6 Play main 4,000mah kii bydaree di gai he or company ne daawa kiya tha ki yah 36 ghante kaa byaap degi agar normal yuj karen to
 In our review, this does not fully meet the company's claims in battery testing, but you will not be disappointed
 mixd yuj main ek din kii bydaree byaap mil jaati he
 This includes watching videos, surfing, using social media and listening to songs
 yah terbo charging saport saktaa he jisase fast georging sambhav he
 By charging just a few minutes, you can run it for hours
 is segment main agar aap acha dikhne vaala or acchhee bydaree byaap vaala smartphone khareednaa chaahate hai to ye aapke liye behatar opshan he
 But if you want to buy it for photography and performance, then you have many options

 The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has temporarily banned the e-kyc verification of Bharti airtel-airtel Payment Bank linked to its bank customers and SIM card basis
 bhashaa ke hawaale se ye jaankaree mili he
 UIDAI has taken this action due to allegations of alleged misuse of Aadhaar e-kyc based SIM verification process on Bharti Airtel
 aarope he ki airtel ne apane apane graahakon kii 'samuchit sahmati liye bina hi unkebank khatekhol die jabaki ve to apane sim kaa aadhaar besd kevaisi karwaane aate the
 Along with this, UIDAI has also expressed serious concern over allegations that the company was also linking these payment bank accounts to get LPG LPG subsidy
 sutron ke anusaar UIDAI ne ek antarim aadesh main kaha he, 'bharti airtel limited or airtel pements bank kii i-kevaisi license ko tatkaal prabhaav se nilambit kiya jaataa he
 This means that at the moment, less than Kirtelkam will not be able to use uidai's e-kyc process to associate its customers' SIM card with their Aadhaar
 iske saath hi airtel pements bank aadhaar i-kevaisi ke jariye nae khate bhi nahin khol paaegaa
 However, other available mediums can be used for this
 company ke pravaktaa ne kya kahaertal ke pravaktaa ne is bare main sampark kiye jane par kaha, 'ham isaki pushti kar sakate hai ki hamen aadhaar sambhddha i -kevaisi sevaaon ke asthaayee nilamban ke sambandh main UIDAI kaa antarim aadesh mila he
 The spokesperson said that this suspension has been done till the satisfaction of certain procedures related to connecting customers with Airtel Payments Bank
 pravaktaa ne ummid jataai ki is mudde kaa sheeghra hi koi samaadhaan nikaal liya jayega
 He said that the company has taken steps in this regard
 kya hoga graahakon par asareirtel kaa i-kevaisi license radd hone se airtel ke graahakon ko pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Now if he wants to link his mobile number to Aadhaar, then at the moment he will have the option to link only by going to Aadhaar Enrollment Center
 vah company ke retailor centre main jaakar yah kaam nahin nipta paaenge
 It has not been clarified by the UIDAI yet how long this ban will be imposed on Airtel
 aise main airtel pements ke graahakon ko apana acount aadhaar se link karne main dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 It is expected that the Aadhaar Authority may issue guidelines in this regard in the coming days
 isamen athurity ye saaf kar sakati he ki airtel par laga ye pratibandh kab tak rahegaa
 Apart from this, a new guideline can also be issued to Airtel customers to link their mobile number and Airtel Payments Bank
 bataa den ki airtel par pehle bhi aise aarope lage the ki vah mobile number ko aadhaar card se link karne ke liye aae graahakon se apane pements bank main khaataa khulavaa rahi he
 The UIDAI then warned Airtel to do so
 haalanki airtel ne safai di thi ki unke retailor centre main paardarshee vyavastha apanaai ja rahi he
 The company had said that any customer base is being used for the purpose for which it is being sought

 In the film, she is seen in Intense Character alongside Imran Hashmi and Rajkumar Rao
 haal hi menvidyane film industry main ek dashak bhi puraa kar liya he
 Excerpts from the conversation i had with him: Mahesh Bhatt creates a different character, how was the work experience with him? Working with Mahesh Bhatt in 'our Adhuri Kahani' was the fulfillment of my unfulfilled dream
 jaisaa unke bare main sochaa tha, vah bilkul vaise hi hai
 His perspective on everything is very different
 vah film ke saath bataur riter jude hai lekin unhone meri har detail main madad kii he
 He often sent coats attached to my character so that i could get into it with more depth
 unhone apni likhi ek kitaab mujhe padhane ke liye di
 He told that the character of the film is initially Sita, then she becomes Radha and then Durga
 unka tulana karne kaa najariya bemisaal he
 What kind of preparations did you make for the character of Vasudha? Not much had to be done
 film main florist bani hum to maine asal jindagi main florist ke saath thodaa samay guzaara
 See how she sprinkles water on flowers, how to cut them
 yah to thik he, lekin vasudha isse bhi zyada kuch or he?vasudha aaj kii ladki he
 Has read shaadi-shuda he
 Even then, his thinking is old
 vah maanati he ki use kisi bhi keemat par is shaadi ko nibhaana he
 As Hindustani girls are told that if their doli has gone to the husband's house, then he should get up from there
 aisi hi he vasudha bhi
 
 
 Are there really such characters? Yes
 meri ek saheli kii baat karun to main usase mili
 She was divorced after six years of marriage

 But she was bold, so she voiced
 us din yah baat samaj aa gai ki is tarah kii baaten sirf anpadh pariwaron tak hi simit nahin he, yah varg or simaaon se pare he
 That is, such things are happening around us
 isi cheez ko parade par utaarna vaaki chalange bharaa tha
 You have always played the character of a strong woman, how difficult was it to play a character in which her husband kills her? i assume that happens
 isliye ise kar saki
 But still he has to go through it during the scene
 ab jiserajakumarako mujhe maarna tha
 He escaped by touching me like butter
 lekin maine kaha ki aise nahin chalegaa
 Loudly so that the feeling came and they did so
 yah seen chunauteepurn tha
 Quarrels occur in married couples
 bas, isi tarahasiinako bhi karnaa tha, chalanging tha, usamen utarana
 You have also been very active in spreading social awareness, do these efforts really seem to benefit or result? Yes, their results come out and feel good
 jaise kuch din pehle hi maharashtra main ek ladki kii shaadi ho rahi thi or uske mata-pita ne use portable toilet gift main di
 That is, think where the toilet is

 The High Court has refused to grant him bail
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki jayalalita kii ore se aaj supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya ja saktaa he
 On Tuesday, the first public prosecutor spoke of not objecting to conditional bail, which led to the false news that Jayalalithaa was getting bail, which led Jayalalithaa's supporters to celebrate, but the celebrations did not last long
 hoicourt ne jamaanat dene or sajaa sthagit karne kii argiyaan khaarij karte hue kaha ki aise maamalon main sashart jamaanat di jaati rahi he, lekin adaalat bhrashtachar par supreme court kii taaja tippanee ke mutabik chal rahi he or supreme court ne haal main bhrashtachar ko maanavadhikaar kaa ulanghan or samaaj kaa dushman bataaya he haalanki varisht vakil ram jethmalani ne dhyaan dilaayaa ki aisi hi haalat main lalu yadav ko jamaanat mil chuki he, lekin jaj rajamand nahin dikhe
 Despite this, the public prosecutor did not object to conditional bail
 ab jayalalita ke saamne supreme court main hi arji kaa vikalp bachaa he

 hairaani kii baat he ki shila ne jamaakhoron or kalabazaariyon par karrwai kii baat na kahkar unase guzarish kii ki ve aisa na karen
 By the way, to control the prices of onions in Delhi, the Sheila government itself wants to sell onions
 shila ne aaj kaha ki aachaar samhita lagi hone kii vajah se iske liye chunaav ayog se ijaajat maangi jaaegi
 Sheila said that a team of Delhi officials has gone to Nashik to fetch onions at a low price
 iske alaava nafed bhi dilli sarkaar ko no proffit no los par pyaaj kii supplai karegaa

 krushimantri sharad pavaar ne kah diya ki pyaaj par sarkaar kaa bas nahin
 Pawar has said on Wednesday that onion prices are not going to come down before two to three weeks

 vakil pediti aachaari ke mutabik, samvidhan kii dhara 101, 102, 190, 191 or 361 ke vibhinn praavdhaanon ke aadhaar par vidhayakon ko ayogy ghoshit kiya gaya he
 That is, a member cannot live in the current House and Government
 agar wo khaali hui seat par yaa phir loksabhaa yaa anya kisi sadan kaa chunaav jeet jaataa he to kanoon kii nigaah main wo bedaag ho jaataa he
 That is, he is born second
 istife kii duhai, mantri pad kii chaahatbaagi vidhayakon ne sadan ke spikar or supreme court tak ke saamne apana istipha hi sweekaar kar liye jane kii duhai dete hue edi-chotii kaa jor laga diya tha
 Because he was concerned not about the legislative post but the post of minister
 mantri ban kar chunaav jeetna jitna aasaan he, utana sadak par rahakar jeetna nahin
 The legislators therefore pressured him to accept the resignation
 vahiin, spikar ne inako raajnneetik sabak sikhaane ke liye ayogy ghoshit kar apane adhikaar or kartavya par focus kiya
 Disqualification under the anti-defection law states that Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar has stated that these mlas did not voluntarily resign, so they rejected it and disqualified them under the defection law
 aise main ab ayogy tehraae gaye vidhayakon ke saamne hai court yaa supreme court jane kaa vikalp he
 What is the math of Karnataka After 17 mlas were disqualified, the number of Karnataka Legislative Assembly has been reduced to 207
 is hisaab se bahumat kaa aankada 104 vidhayakon kaa rah gaya
 The previous trust vote saw 99 votes in favor of Kumaraswamy and 105 in favor of BJP
 is hisaab se bijepi ke paas 105 vidhayakon kaa samarthan he, jo sarkaar banane ke liye jaruri number kii jarurat ko puraa karata he
 In such a situation, all eyes are now on the floor test of the Yeddyurappa government to be held on Monday, in which it is considered possible for his government to remain stable, but the legislators who have demolished the Kumaraswamy government by rebellion will get a special benefit at the government level, such The possibilities are rarely seen
 loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle charan ke matdaan se thik pehle congress ke kai netaaon ke karibiyon par chhapemari tej ho gai he
 In Madhya Pradesh, the house of Chief Minister Kamal Nath's close friend was raided and on Monday night, close to Congress veteran Ahmed Patel also came under this circle
 aarope laga ki congress ke paas kareeb 20 karod rupee kii rakam hawala ke jariye ai he
 Now a source close to Ahmed Patel has given complete information in this matter
 kareebi sutara ke daawey ke mutabik, ‚Äòahamed patel party ke koshadhyaksh hai or jiske ghar iskar vibhaag ne chapa maaraa vah esaem moin unka hi chif acountint he
 On Monday, he did not come to the office all day, told that he was ill
 ahamed patel shaam ko unke ghar haalchaal lene pahunche to unhen chhapemari kii koi jaankaree nahin thi
 Nobody stopped them from going there
 ‚Äôahamed patel vahaan kareeb 10 minute tak ruke, lekin baad main chhapemari hui kya hua unhen iske bare main poochtacha nahin he
 Ahmad Patel's source said that the Congress does not belong to any hawala, it is not known who is spreading such things before the election
 bataa den ki somvaar ko jab iskar vibhaag kii team rajdhani dilli kii gita colony main moin ke ghar chhapemari ke liye pahunchi to unke saath mediakarmi bhi maujuud the
 Then the local people created a ruckus there and misbehaved with many media persons
 darasal, iskar vibhaag kaa kahana he ki esaem moin ne hi hawala ke 20 karod rupee congress daftar main pahunchaae the
 In the same doubt, IT raided Delhi, NCR, Bhopal, Indore and Goa
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki kareeb 300 adhikariyon ne ye search oparation chalaaya or 52 thikaanon par red maari

 The occasion is of the Iftar party, hosted by Sonia Gandhi herself
 un shaks ko bhi kuch kam tavajjo nahin mil rahi, jo vahaan unki bain taraf baithe hai&bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar
 However there is nothing unexpected in it
 jaise-jaise bihar ke chunaav najadik aa rahe hai, nitish congress ke nae chahete ban gaye hai
 In the midst of all this, what was contrary to expectation was the absence of some non-congress leaders

 Jayalalithaa, Mayawati and Mamata Banerjee were saying a lot, not even missing together
 haalanki sharad pavaar or prafull patel vahaan maujuud the, lekin unki rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ab apane puraane kad kii chaaya bhar rah gai he
 At least three saffron party-ruled states are currently vulnerable to allegations of corruption and scams

 The weather will be disturbing, but fire is not expected to rise like it was expected in the first monsoon session of Parliament, which runs from July 21 to August 13
 is baat ke saare sanket us iftaar party main maujuud the
 As clean as the washed out sky is after the rain

 In view of all this, these results were already being drawn that now all the guns of the main opposition party in Parliament will be directed towards the NDA government
 danaadan golon kii barsaat hogi
 The rules of the game were very simple
 bisaat bich chuki thi
 Walk all your bets, keep the tone high and then demand the resignation of the accused one by one
 lalit modi ko britain jane ke liye jaruri kagajaat hasil karne main madad karne ke liye videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj kaa istipha, ipiel ke purv daagdar kamisionar ke saath kathith vyavsaayik saudon ke liye rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje kaa istipha or vyapam ghotaale main shaamil hone ke aaropon kii vajah se madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kaa istipha
 Iftar's feast indicated that his party was going to be very isolated in this battle
 aisa lagata he ki congress ek aise samay main sabhi vipakshi dalon ko ekajute karne main naakaam rahi, jab bijepi sankat ke daur se guzar rahi he or yahaan tak ki pradhanmantri modi tak ke ye daawey ki ‚Äúna khaauungaa, na khaane duungaa‚Äù kii vishwasaneeyata bhi andeh ke ghere main he
 While Jayalalithaa, Mulayam and Mayawati ignored Sonia Gandhi's invitation, Lalu and Mamta sent their representatives
 yahaan tak ki sipiem ke mahasachiv seetaram yechuri bhi tab landan main the, jinke saath sonia ke bahut achche sambandh hai
 The Left parties have always been the most supportive allies in raising their voice against the NDA
 lekin is baar ve bhi nadaarad the
 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi admitted that the Iftar feast was part of the process of negotiating further plans and strategies between opposition parties
 haalanki yah mulaakaat kitni kaamyaab rahi, iskaa anumaan isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki amethi ke saansad khud is baat ko lekar anishchit the ki sarkaar ke khilaaf unki ranneeti kya hogi
 On one occasion, he was heard asking DMK leader Kanimozhi about Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa's alleged closeness with the BJP
 rahul kii muskaraahat hameshaa kii tarah khili hui thi, lekin jab reportron ne unase poocha ki sansad main modi sarkaar ke saath unka rukh or ranneeti kya hogi to unki pareshaani bhi saaf dekhi ja sakati thi
 When asked if he would pressurize Modi to give his statement on allegations of corruption leveled against the BJP government in various states, Rahul replied, "who am i to ask him to give a statement?" This is their privilege
 ‚Äù vipaksh ke bich failaa anischitata kaa maahaul or bhi kai baton se jaahir he
 If sources are to be believed, the Trinamool Congress, NCP, Janata Dal (united) and Samajwadi Party informally agree that Sushma Swaraj should be targeted

 congress ke baahar ekmaatr nitish kumaar hi bade kad ke aise netaa hai, jo bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke liye modi par waar kar rahe hai
 a Congress general secretary told India Today, ‚Äúthe regional parties have a narrow outlook
 ve tab tak kisi cheez par pratikriya nahin karatin, jab tak ve khud usase sidhe prabhavit na ho rahi hon
 The Trinamool Congress may demand Raje's resignation
 lekin party ab bhi is baat ko lekar kisi thos nattejey par nahin pahunchi he
 "rajya Sabha MP Derek o'brien of the Trinamool Congress says that he cannot disclose the party's strategy of the monsoon session before the party meeting
" rahul kii chuppi ke baavjood congress kaa think tanks sanvaidhanik muddon par sarkaar par suniyojit waar karne kii taiyaari kar chukaa he
 Congress has already clarified its stand on some controversial bills to be introduced in this monsoon session, such as the Whistleblower Protection (amendment) Bill, 2015; Right and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (amendment) Ordinance, 2015; The Constitution (122nd Amendment) (GST) Bill, 2014; The Real Estate (regulation and Development) Bill, 2013
 234 sadasyon vaali rajyasabha main 68 sadasyon vaali congress ke samarthan ke bagaiyr endie ke liye koi bhi vidheyak paarit karnaa mumkin nahin hoga
 (see box) In such a situation, the party is focusing its attention on only two things: Land Acquisition and Goods and Services Tax Bill
 haalanki aisa nahin he ki congress har morche par puri tarah parajeet ho gai ho
 The stance of most regional parties on the land acquisition bill is clear
 aise main rajyasabha main endie ke liye ise paarit karwaanaa naammumkin ho jayega, jahaan endie ke maatr 61 sadsy hai
 Even BJP allies like Shiromani Akali Dal and Shiv Sena have expressed their displeasure about the current form of the bill
 vahiin eiediemke pramukh jayalalita ne mahatvapurn you-turn lete hue 15 july ko modi ko patr likhakar unase bill main koi sanshodhan na karne kaa anurodh kiya he
 Bijurathi Mahtab, leader of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) in the Lok Sabha, says that we will support the bill if the government agrees to their suggestions
 party ne paanch sanshodhan karne kaa suzav diya he
 One of them is that whose land is being acquired, he will be a partner in the industry being built there
 sapa ke rukh main vipaksh kii ranneeti ko saaf dekha ja saktaa he
 The strategy is that after coming to the upper house, the SP will pressurize the bill to send it to the Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha
 sapa ke sansadeey board ke ek sadsy kehete hai, ‚Äúyah sansadeey prakriya he ki har vidheyak ko pravar samiti ke paas bheja janaa chahie
 But NDA has not followed this procedure in the case of land acquisition bill
 ‚Äù isse modi ko donon sadanon kaa sanyukt satr bulaakar bill ko paarit karaane kaa mauka bhi nahin milegaa
 Yechury says, "the opposition will not allow the bill to be passed in Parliament, nor will it fall so that the government does not get a chance to call a joint session of the two houses
" ‚Äùhaalanki vastu evam seva kar vidheyak par trinmul congress or bijedy sarkaar ke saath he
 According to bjd's Mahtab, the BJD will not oppose the Goods and Services Tax bill, but mineral-rich states such as Odisha should also be allowed to levy a cess of 1 per cent
 ummid he ki is bill ko 21 sadasyon vaali pravar samiti kaa samarthan hasil hoga kyonki congress or sapa hi iskaa virodh karne vaali hai
 Jyotiraditya Scindia, the outspoken voice of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, says, ‚Äúthe Goods and Services Tax bill cannot be allowed to be passed in its current form
 yahaan tak ki gujarat sarkaar ne bhi iskaa virodh kiya he
 "the parliamentary committee is scheduled to submit its report on 17 July
 lekin aisa lagata nahin he ki is raste par congress ko safalataa milane vaali he
 The question is also how long the allies will remain in the fray and how long the Congress will be able to stay strong
