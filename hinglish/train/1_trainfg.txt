 Lord Macaulay once remarked maliciously that one acre of land in Middlesex is better than a state in the dreamland
 vyavhaar kushal raajnneetik bhale hi is kathan se sahamat hona chahen or swapndarshiyon kaa uphaas udaana chahen
 But independent India is very conscious of the fact that dreams of dreamers like Vivekananda, Arvind, Tagore and Gandhi during the freedom struggle have been inspiring the nation and ultimately helped in its liberation
 inamen se prayek mahaan manishi ne apane adwitiya dhang se sapanom ke bharat-samooche vishwa se sammaan kaa adhikaar rakhane vaale mahaan or shandaar bharat-kaa ullekh kiya
 i believe that the framers of the Constitution of India have presented their dreams in a very competent manner in the Preamble of the Constitution, indicating the day when all Indians will be able to achieve social, economic and political justice; - You will get freedom of thinking, expression, belief, faith and worship; - You will get equality of privilege and opportunity; And will encourage all these things for everyone; - will create such brotherhood, in which the pride of the person and unity of the nation is confirmed
 rajnatik kaaryakarta hone ke naate main bhavi bharat ko lekar gauravpurn dhang se saadhy is ucch sankalpana kaa purnatah samarthan karata hum
 i am extremely excited about its accomplishment
 aaj jab mujhe bharat ke bhavishya ko lekar phir se apni sankalpana kaa khaakaa prastut karne ke liye kaha gaya he to main 22 varsh purv likhe gaye apane us lekh ke ek shabd main bhi parivartan nahin karnaa chaahunga
 But what a great change has come in Indian politics between 1987 and 2009
 san 1987 main meri party bhaajapa ke paas aathvin loksabhaa main atyant kam saansad hua karte the
 In the House of 543 members then their number was only two
 iske vipareet, pandrahavin loksabhaa ke liye san 2009 ke chunaav prachaar ke bich in panktiyon ko likhte samay bhaajapa rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) ke apane sahyogiyon ke saath agali sarkaar ke gathan kii taiyaari karne waalon main sabase aage he
 In fact, within nine years of writing an article for the Illustrated Weekly of India, the BJP emerged as the single largest party by defeating the Congress in 1996
 iske do varsh baad 1998 main bhaajapa kii aguai main rajg atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv main centre main sarkaar banane main safal rahaa
 It had the distinction of becoming the first stable government of a non-congress alliance in the history of independent India
 apane chah varsh ke shasankaal main usne desh kii rashtriya suraksha ko atyant sudrudh kiya (bharat ko parmaanu shastr sampann desh bana diya), desh ke aarthik vikaas (rashtriya rajmarg vikaas pariyojna, pradhanmantri gram sadak yojana or doorsanchaar evam soochna praudyogiki sevaaon main joardaar vistaar) kii gati main teji laai tathaa saamaajik pragati ko bal diya (sarvashiksha abhiyaan lagu kar sarvatra praathmik shiksha kaa lakshya praapt kiya)
 At the moment when BJP and NDA are engaged in seeking another mandate for themselves in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, we have given our message to the voters
 or is sandesh main teen vaade kiye gaye hai-acha shashan, vikaas or suraksha
 These promises are the same that the veterans of the Indian freedom struggle and our Constitution makers had made to the public
 samgr rup se dekhen to ve hamaare raashtra kii aavashyaktaaon or hamaari janata kii aakankshaon ko puraa karte hai
 By good governance i mean honest and corruption-free governance in accordance with law
 iskaa arth shashan kii aisi pranali or samskruti he, jisamen satta par baithe log apane sankeern hiton main yaa pakshpaati dhang se loktantric sansthaaon kaa durupyog nahin karte
 But the UPA government has been doing this again and again
 sansthaaon ko tahas-nahas karne kaa sabase lajjajanak udhaaharan pradhanmantri pad kaa avamulyan or boforce bhrashtachar cond main pramukh abhiyukt ottavio kwatrochi ko bina sunwaayee ke sibiai ke sahyog se bari kar diya janaa he
 It is the duty of those who hold the reins of power to give good governance, to empower the people and strengthen democracy and make it more accountable, responsive and participatory
 meraa pakkaa vishwaas he ki garibi, pichhadepan, nirakshartaa, beemaari or berogari ke viruddh hamaari aadhi se adhik ladaai centre se lekar rajyon or panchayaton tak prayek str par shashan kii gunvattta or samarthy main sudhaar laakar jiti ja sakati he
 The BJP considers national security to be of paramount importance both at the external and internal levels
 hamaare chunaav ghoshnaa patr ke saath-saath soochna praudyogiki or avasanrachana sambandhi duuradrushti vaale dastavej bharat ke drutagami vikaas ke liye santulit drushtikon prastut karte hai
 They present two major challenges to the country on the economic front - removal of poverty and socio-geographical imbalance in development by providing gainful employment to every physically capable person
 congress ne aam aadmi ko lekar shor to khub machaaya, lekin sirf khaas aadmi ko laabh pahunchaaya he
 a former Reserve Bank governor said last year that the gap between rich and poor has widened so much today that the wealth of the richest 20 Indian families is more than the wealth of the poorest 300 million Indians
 lekin meraa sapana aise samrudh bharat kaa nirmaan karne kaa he, jisamen vikaas kaa aadhaar vyapak ho, jisamen sabhi samudaay ke garibon ko raashtra ke sansadhano par pehla daawa karne kaa adhikaar ho
 Our strategy for economic development will take into account the epoch-making changes that are now taking place in the international economic system
 vishwa arthvyavastha kaa gurutv centre ab pashchimi deshon se hatakar asia kii ore aa rahaa he
 And this change is not going to reverse
 aisi sthiti ke chalate bharat ko avasar mila he ki vah ek yaa do dashak ke bheetar vishwa main netritvkaari aarthik or rajnatik shakti ke taur par ubharne kaa prayaas kare
 But in order to seize these opportunities, we must consciously remove the center of gravity of our national economy from the narrow base of the city-centric corporate sector, and it should be used for agriculture and other sectors of the rural economy, small and medium enterprises and non-government and unorganized sectors
 Should be taken in khaskar hamen bharat ke maanav sansadhano ko uske anukul shiksha or ucch str kii swasthya suvidhaon se samrudh karnaa hoga
 The BJP is proud of India's priceless spiritual and cultural heritage, which has protected our civilization from many vicissitudes of history more than anything else
 isliye shashan or vikaas kaa hamaara sapana maanav jivan ke mulyon or aadarshon se nirdeshit hoga, jisaki jhalak gandhi ji kii raamarajy kii avadharana main milti he
 i am well aware of the deep gap between that high ideal and the reality of today's political system
 baharhaal, us khai ko paatane kaa eemaandaaree se prayaas karnaa hi hamaara lakshya he
 5 questions from LK Advani, what will you do to get India out of the economic crisis? We start 100 infrastructural projects of national importance in the fields of electricity, water (river connectivity), roads, railways, telecom and IT, ports, airports and rural infrastructure will do
 ham unhen karyanvit karne kaa adhikaar shridharan sareekhe 100 logon ko denge
 Priority will be made by changing the strategy according to agriculture, small and medium enterprises and non-government sector so that new employment and entrepreneurial opportunities can be created
 rashtriya suraksha main bharosa behaal karne ke liye aap kya pag uthaaenge?hamaari niti aatankwaadi ke prati asahansheeltaa kii hogi
 We believe that Pakistan has become the center of global terrorism
 ham aatankwaad or naksali hinsa se ladane ke liye kanoonee or prashaskeey upayon kaa puri takat ke saath istemaal karenge
 We will take effective steps to prevent Bangladeshi infiltration
 aapraadhik maamalon main nyaay kii sthiti arajak he
 What would you suggest on this? We will implement the recommendations of the Malimath Committee expeditiously
 nyaay milane main deree karne vaali prakriyaaon ko hataaya jayega
 Police forces will be equipped with training, better equipment, weapons, state-of-the-art communication systems, etc
 shashan ko bhrashtachar kaa ghun laga hua he or usamen javabdehi kaa abhaav he
 What will you do about it? Corruption, red tape and persecution through Inspector Raj will be stopped
 bhrashtachar ke aise maamalon se, jinase lok sevak jude hue hon, nibatane ke liye ham drutagami nyaayalay sthapit karenge
 Along with this, comprehensive reforms related to good governance will also be brought so that transparency and accountability will be promoted
 raajnneeti kaa apradheekaran ab mahamari kaa rup le chukaa he
 How will you put an end to it? If a NDA government comes forward and elected, then people facing criminal charges will not be made ministers
 raajnneeti ko aparadhmukt karne ke liye ham duusari rajnatik partiyon ke saath milakar kaam karenge taaki koi kargar samaadhaan nikal sake

 Still the state governments have not been able to find a teacher

 At the same time regional parties are coming together and trying to boost their strength
 aise main in sabhi ummiido or koshishon ke bich india today or karvi incits ne ye jaanane kii koshish kii aakhir desh kii janata kisko piem banate dekhnaa chaahati he
 Who is his choice
 is survey ke jariye jo nattejey saamne aa rahe hai wo congress ke liye behad achche hai or bijepi ke liye chintajanak
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has been very aggressive on the PM since the recent victory in three states and it can be clearly seen in the survey results that Rahul Gandhi's popularity is increasing than before
 vahiin piem modi kaa graph neeche gir rahaa he
 Rahul Gandhi is giving a tough competition to the post of PM, if the survey of MOTN January 2019 and the survey of January 2017, Rahul Gandhi's popularity has increased
 vah piem pad ke liye modi ko kadi takkar dete dikh rahe hai
 In January 2017, the gap between the choice of the post of PM was 55% and now it has come down to 12%
 mood of de nesan ke agast 2018 ke survey main uttar bharat main piem modi kii lokapriyata jo 56 fisadi thi vah janvari 2019 ke survey main girakar 54 fisadi par aa gai he
 At the same time, Rahul Gandhi's popularity has increased from 19 percent to 26 percent
 purvi bharat kii baat karen to agast 2018 main piem modi kii lokapriyata jo 51 fisadi thi usamen 1 fisadi kii badhochari hui he or vah 52 fisadi ho gai he
 At the same time, the popularity of the Congress president is more than that of PM Modi but he is still behind him
 agast 2018 main rahul gandhi kii lokapriyata is kshetra main 20 fisadi thi, usamen ab 8 fisadi kaa ijapha hua he or vah 28 fisadi ho gai he
 PM Modi's popularity in South India in August 2018, which was 31%, has come down to 25%
 vahiin rahul gandhi kii lokapriyata main 8 fisadi kaa ijapha hua he
 Rahul Gandhi's popularity in August 2018 was 46 percent, which has now grown to 54 percent
 ab ham baat karte hai pashchimi bharat kii
 If you look at the results of this area, then also the popularity of PM Modi has decreased and Rahul Gandhi's popularity has increased, although he is still behind PM Modi
 agast 2018 main piem modi kii lokapriyata is kshetra main 55 fisadi thi
 PM Modi's popularity has decreased by 6% in the January 2019 survey
 unki lokapriyata ab 49 fisadi rah gai he
 At the same time, Rahul Gandhi's popularity which was 24% in the August 2018 survey has increased to 28%
 shahari ilaake main bhi piem modi kii lokapriyata main ijapha hua to vahiin gramin kshetra main unki lokapriyata main kami ai he
 At the same time, Rahul Gandhi's popularity is increasing in both the areas
 shahari kshetra main piem modi kii lokapriyata agast 2018 ke survey main jo 47 fisadi thi usamen 1 fisadi kaa ijapha hua he or vah 48 fisadi ho gai he
 At the same time, the popularity of the Congress president has increased to 32 percent in the urban area, which was 24 percent in the August 2018 survey
 gramin ilaake main bhi rahul gandhi kii lokapriyata main ijapha hua he
 His popularity which was 28% in August 2018 has increased to 34%
 iske baad mahilaon or purushon ke bich yah jaanane kii koshish kii gai kiski pansad koun he
 PM Modi's popularity among men has come down from earlier
 to vahiin rahul gandhi kii lokapriyata main ijapha hua
 At the same time, there has been a decrease in the popularity of PM Modi and increase in popularity of Rahul Gandhi among women, but overall PM Modi still has an edge over Rahul Gandhi
 agast 2018 ke survey main jahaan 50 fisadi purush piem modi ko pasand karte the to vahiin janvari 2019 ke survey main 45 fisadi purush piem modi ko pasand karte hai
 Rahul Gandhi's popularity which used to be 27 per cent in August 2018 increased to 35 per cent in January 2019
 agast 2018 ke survey main jahaan 48 fisadi mahilaayein piem ko pasand karti thim to vahiin janvari 2019 main 46 fisadi mahilaayein ab bhi piem modi ko pasand karti hai
 Rahul Gandhi's popularity is also increasing here
 agast 2018 main jahaan 27 fisadi mahilaayein unako pasand karti thim to vahiin janvari 2019 ke survey main 32 fisadi mahilaayein unako pasand karti hai
 In terms of caste and religion, if you look at caste and religion, PM Modi is also leading here, but for BJP, the concern is that PM Modi's popularity among Muslims is very less than Rahul Gandhi
 saamaanya varg ke 48 fisadi log jahaan piem modi ko pasand karte hai to vahiin 29 fisadi log rahul gandhi ko pasand karte hai
 The most exciting figures are being seen in SC and ST category
 yahaan par muqabla baraabar kaa he
 Both leaders like 39-39 per cent of this class
 obisi varg ke 34 fisadi log congress adhyaksh ko pansad karte hai to vahiin 48 fisadi log piem modi ko pasand karte hai
 According to religion, PM Modi's popularity among Hindus is still intact
 vahiin rahul gandhi ko isamen or mehnat karne kii jarurat he
 50 percent of Hindus of the country prefer PM Modi while the Congress president likes 29 percent of Hindus
 muslimon main piem modi kii lokapriyata behad kam he jo 14 fisadi he, vahiin rahul gandhi kii lokapriyata 63 fisadi he
 At the same time, that is, 26 percent of the rest of the religion likes PM Modi, 49 percent likes Rahul Gandhi
 pradhanmantri pad kii pasanddesh kaa aglaa pradhanmantri koun hoga
 The answer to this question will be found only after the elections, but the figures coming out of the survey are definitely going to increase the concern of BJP and the Congress will be encouraged
 desh ke 46 fisadi log aaj bhi modi ko pradhanmantri banate dekhnaa chaahate hai to 34 fisadi logon ne apni pasand rahul gandhi ko bataaya
 Mamata Banerjee, who rallied opposition leaders against Modi at Kolkata's Bigrade Maidan, is considered by 3 per cent to be the choice of PM
 vahiin haal hi congress kii mahasachiv banaai gayi priyanka gandhi ko 2 fisadi log piem pad kii pasand maanate hai

 As long as there are tainted ministers in the cabinet, the reputation of the state will continue to deteriorate

 (input bhashaa se) Former Australia cricketer Kerry o'keeffe apologized for making fun of Indian batsman Mayank Agarwal's first-class career during the Melbourne Test, saying that his intention was not to insult the batsman making the debut
 o'kief ne ‘fox cricket’ ke liye camentator kii bhoomika nibhaate hue kaha tha ki agarwal ne apana pratham shrenee tihara shatak ‘railway canteen staff’ ke khilaaf jadaa he
 o'keefe received a lot of criticism on social media for this comment and the cricketer, who played 24 Tests for Australia, apologized on Thursday for commenting on Agarwal, who scored 76 runs in his first Test
 yahaan sthaneey media ne o'kief ke hawaale se kaha, ‘main bharat main pratham shrenee cricket main agarwal dwaara banaae ranon kaa zikr kar rahaa tha or is par pratikriya hui
 Mayank Agarwal was running, joking Kangaroo commentator, he said, 'I was not denying his level in any way
 kaaphi ran banaae gaye or agar kisi ko bura laga to main iske liye maafee maangata hum
 The 27-year-old Agarwal plays for Karnataka in the Indian domestic circuit and his average is around 50 runs
 aapako bataa den ki melbern test ke pehle din mayank agarwal ne apni debyue pari main shandaar 76 ran banaae, lekin camentry ke dauraan shen worne or mark howard ke alaava o'kief ne bhartiya pratham shrenee cricket pranali par kataaksh kiya

 ' We all know that Salman Khan is always ready for all possible help from his friends
 ab khabar he ki salmaan khan ek baar phir katrina ke saath film karenge, kyonki katrina kii naiya bollywood kii majdhaar main duubati najar aa rahi he
 There was a bail that Salman and Katrina had discussions with Ishq
 magar baad main katrina ne salmaan ko chhodkar ranbir kapur kaa daaman thama
 Now after the breakup of Ranbir, Katrina was seen meeting Salman many times
 kai khabaren bhi udin, jisamen yah bhi kaha gaya ki salmaan ne us samay ranbir ke saath rishton main bandhane ke liye katrina ko manaa kiya tha or kaha tha ki ranbir unhen dhokhaa degaa
 The comments sachai chaahe jo bhi ho magar katrina kii is dukh kii ghadi main ek baar phir salmaan khadey nazar aa rahe hai or katrina bhi ek baar phir salmaan ke hi darbar main pahunchin, kyonki katrina kii pichhali filmein naakaam ho chuki hai or ranbir ke saath shaadi karne kii taiyaariyon main katrina ne kariyar ko bhi nazarandaaj kiya tha
 In such a situation, if Salman Khan again puts his hand on Katrina's head, then Katrina may have a great comeback in Bollywood
 vaise kaha jaataa he ki salmaan khan mitti ko choote hai to wo bhi sona ban jaataa he
 In such a situation, Katrina will once again need to be with Salman and her hands because Salman as well as Katrina can overcome the sinking boat

 But later, Katrina joined Ranbir Kapoor, except Salman
 ab ranbir se brallep ke baad kai baar katrina salmaan se milti najar ain

 Katrina's career was also ignored in the preparation of aise main agar salmaan khan phir katrina ke sir par haath rakh den to katrina kii bollywood main shandaar vaapasi ho sakati he
 By the way, when Salman Khan touches the soil, it too becomes gold

 Significantly, when the campaign is going on in the Gujarat elections, the statement of the Prime Minister matters that his government may have to suffer political losses in the elections due to these big economic decisions
 haalanki piem modi ne apane faislon ko sahi tehraate hue kaha ki '2014 main jab ham aae to hamen viraasat main kya mila tha? arthvyavastha kii haalat, gavarnence kii haalat, phisakal order or banking system kii haalat, sab bigadi hui thi
 Our country was counted in the Frazile Five
 'bade or sthai parivartan aise hi nahin aate uske liye puure system main badlaav karne padate hai
 When these changes happen, the country reaches 142 to 100 in the ranking of Ease of Doing Business in just three years
 ise bhi padhein: modi kii mureed ivaanka trump, boleen- white house main bharat kaa sachcha dostjab yojanaon main gati hoti he, tabhi desh main pragati aati he
 There must have been some changes due to which the speed of all the schemes of the government has increased
 saadhan vahi hai, sansaadhan vahiin hai, lekin system main raftaar aa gai he
 This has happened because the government is developing a new work culture in bureaucracy
 jis din desh main zyaadaatar kharid-farokht, paise ke len-dein kaa ek technical or digital hone lag gaya, us din se sangathit bhrashtachar kaaphi had tak tham jayega
 i know how much it will cost me politically, but i am ready for that too
 aadhaar ke saath mobile or jandhan kii takat jud jane se ek aisi vyavastha kaa nirmaan hua he, jiske bare main kuch saal pehle tak sochaa bhi nahin ja saktaa tha
 With the help of Aadhaar, crores of fake names have been removed from the system in the last 3 years
 ab benami sampatti ke khilaaf bhi ye ek bada hathiyaar banane ja rahaa he

 One such change is being helped by Aadhaar number
 aadhaar ek aisi shakti he jisase ye sarkaar garibon ke adhikaar ko sunishchit karana chaahati he
 Aadhaar has a big role to play in providing cheap ration, scholarship, medicine expenses, pension, subsidy from the government and the poor
 vahiin piem modi ne kaha ki notebandi ke baad desh main bada badlaav dekhne ko mila he
 This is the first time since independence, when the corrupt people are scared before black money transactions

 bhimrao ambedkar kii jayanti ke avasar par vam dalon ke sanyukt aahvaan par bhakpa-maale ne puure rajya main samvidhan bachaao-desh bachaao diwas kaa aayojan kiya
 Under this, marches were organized in various areas of the state including capital Patna to protest against communal violence and increasing oppression of Dalits
 betia main aaj hi ke din bhoomi adhikaar march va sabha kaa aayojan kiya gaya, jisamen mukhya vaktaa ke bataur party ke mahasachiv dipankar bhattacharya or rajya sachiv kunal shaamil hue
 Addressing the march, the speakers said that today it has become fully evident that the BJP-RSS is not only against Muslims, but the people of the Dalit community are its main targets
 sampradayik hinsa, daliton kaa utpeedan, balaatkaar kii ghatnaayen is sarkaar kii pahchaan ban gai hai
 When India was shut down against the amendment made in the SC-ST law, then BJP-RSS sponsored India was closed on 10 April against it
 janadbaav main vah ab is sanshodhan kaa virodh kar rahi he, lekin ise rokane ke liye adhyadesh nahin laa rahi he
 This proves that the BJP is bent on changing the constitution made by Ambedkar
 baba sahib ne aisi takaton se desh kii janata ko saavdhaan rahane kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 Actually, the BJP wants to impose Manusmriti in this country instead of the Constitution
 maale ke netaaon ne kaha ki bijepi-aresas nirlajj tareeke se balaatkaariyon kii sangrakshak bani hui he
 BJP leaders are openly favoring rapists
 yah behad sharmnaak he
 a procession is being taken in favor of the rapists with the tricolor in their hands
 yah tirangaa kaa bhi apmaan he
 On these issues, the Prime Minister either maintains silence or talks very lately
 jo sarkaar kamjor varg, mahilaon, daliton, garibon ke sanvaidhanik adhikaron kii raksha nahin kar sakati, use ambedkar kaa naam lene kaa koi haq nahin he
 As much as the names of the BJP-RSS should show Baba Saheb to show off, the truth is that the forces of communal executions are targeting Ambedkar's ideas
 desh, duniya, mahanagar, khel, aarthik or bollywood main kya kuch hua

 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne newjiland ke khilaaf duusare or antim tii20 cricket match main ek ran kii shikast baad kaha ki mejabaan team ko is match ko jeetna chahie tha
 Chasing the target of 168 for New Zealand, the Indian team was in a strong position for 119 for two in 13 overs thanks to the brilliant innings of Virat Kohli (70) but after his dismissal in the next over, the team deviated from the road
 She went for only 166 runs for four wickets
 dhoni ne match ke baad kaha, ‘wicket thodaa dhimaa ho gaya tha or gend ko hit karnaa mushkil ho gaya tha
 But still we should have won this match
 viraat ne hamen acchhee shuruyaat di thi
 "defending the decision to bowl first after winning the toss, Dhoni said," Our concern was how the wicket would behave in the second innings
 duusari pari main 10wein yaa 12wein over ke baad ran bananaa mushkil ho gaya
 Good to see the attitude the batsmen adopted at the start of the innings
 vishwa cap main yah hamaare liye acha hone vaala he
 New Zealand captain Ross Taylor praised Man of the Match Brandon mccullum (91) and James Franklin (2 for 26) for returning the team
 tailor ne kaha, ‘franklin ko shaabaasi milani chahie
 Kohli could take the match away from us
 southi ne shandaar kaich lapka
 This performance has increased our confidence and we hope that it will help further
 ’bhartiya pari ke dauraan yuvaraj singh kaa kaich lapakane kii koshish main maikulam or kyle mills kii takkar ho gai thi jiske baad mills ko chotil hokar maidan se baahar janaa padaa tha
 mccullum said on the injury, 'i'm fine
 kyle thodaa sakate main he
 This pitch was good enough for a 20-over match

 lav jihad, naam to suna hi hoga aapane
 Till now you must have heard stories of love jihad in the country
 lekin jab se supreme court ne lav jehad ko manyata pradaan kii he, tab se ye shabd chaaron taraf charchaa or bahes kaa jwalanth vishay bana hua he, isliye ab khabardaar main ham lav jihad ke jinn kaa sampurna vishleshan karenge
 This jinn of love jihad is born in Kerala from the love marriage of a Hindu girl and a Muslim boy, whose investigation has been entrusted to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to investigate terrorist incidents in the country
 aakhir hota kya he ye lav jihadalav jihad do shabdon se milakar bana he
 The English language word love means love, love, love and the Arabic word jihad
 jiskaa matlab hota he kisi makasad ko puraa karne ke liye apni puri takat laga dena
 That is, when the girls of another religion, who believe in a particular religion, get their girl converted to their religion by trapping them, then this whole process is called love jihad
 ab agar aap lav jehad kaa matlab samaj gaye hai to aapako ye bhi bataa den ki abtak lav jehad shabd ko kanoonee manyata praapt nahin thi
 But now the Supreme Court has accepted that love is jihad and Muslim youth convert Hindu girls to their love trap by making them convert their religion to love jihad
 isaki shuruyaat tab hui jab kerala hoicourt ne 25 may ko hindu mahila akhila ashokan kii shaadi ko radd kar diya tha
 Akhila Ashokan married Muslim man Shafin in December 2016
 aarope he ki nikaah se pehle akhila ne dharm parivartan karke apana naam haadia rakh liya
 Against this, Akhila alias Hadia's parents reached the Kerala High Court
 jinhone aarope lagaaya ki unki beti ko aatankwaadi sanghathan iesas main fidaayin banane ke liye lav jehad kaa sahaara liya gaya
 After which the Kerala High Court quashed the marriage of Akhila alias Hadiya and Shafeen
 lekin akhila urf haadia ke pati shafin ne kerala hoicourt ke aadesh ko supreme court main chunauti di
 Hearing the same matter, the Supreme Court ordered an NIA inquiry into the matter
 aatankwaadi ghatnaon kii jaanch karne vaali agency ko akhila urf haadia or shafin ke prem vivaah main lav jehad or teror conection kaa jimmaa saunpte hue supreme court ne jo tippanee kii, wo bhi gaur karne laayak he
 The Supreme Court said, "just as in the Internet game Blue Whale, a boy or girl is given tasks and in which he has to be suicidal in the end, it has become easier nowadays to persuade anyone for a special purpose"
 supreme court ne kaha he ki enie kii jaanch report or kerala police se mili jaankaree par gaur karne or peedit mahila se baat karne ke baad hi court apana faisla sunayega
 But in this case of Love Jihad, the twist came when the alleged girl of Love Jihad came to the fore

 This alliance is not going to affect the politics of the state
 ab bijepi ko inhen ''kaayade'' se nipataane main madad milegi

 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii chaatr shakha akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad (abivipi) se jude kuch chaatr dilli uniwarsity (diu) kii atrs faikalti ke do countaron par baithte hai
 One is on the main sidewalk outside the counter faculty and the other in the ABVP office a few meters away
 unka kaam haih 2019 ke aam chunaav se thik pehle nae matadaataaon kii pahchaan karnaa, unka naam likhnaa or unhen chunaav ke bare main shikshit karnaa
 New voters, who are usually 18 to 20 years old, arrive there to fill out the form
 daftar kii deevaaron par haath se likhe poster lage hue hai, unhen abivipi kaa sahitya thama diya jaataa he
 One of them says, "vote for strong leadership, vote for a better India
" '' doosraa sargical strike par bani film ke samvaad kaa sahaara lete hue kahata he, ''haau ij da josh, go and vot sar
 "all the posters have one thing in common
" unamem saaf-saaf nahin kaha gaya he ki 'modi ko vot do' yaa 'bhajpa ko vot do'
 But some of the punch lines of the Prime Minister are mentioned in them
 ek poster main sidhaa likhaa haih ''pulavama kaa badla chaahate ho, nae bharat ke liye vot karo
 While the Supreme Court has given clear instructions that the army cannot be used for elections
 lekin yahaan spasht rup se sangh parivaar kii style main prachaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Siddharth Sharma, a local ABVP leader, says, "we never take names, only talk about issues
" ''raajnneeti shaastra kii chaatra or abivipi kii kaaryakarta priya sharma kahati hai, ''yahaan aane vaale zyaadaatar chaatr vibhinn muddon par hamaare vichaaron se prabhavit hokar waapas jate hai
 Sapna Sankal, a 19-year-old student, has become a voter for the first time

 unhone sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main paardarshita dikhaai he
 '' b in Shri Ram College of Commerce
 com ke tritiy varsh ke chaatr shubham goyal bhi pehali baar voter bane hai
 He says, "on most issues, the opposition criticizes Modi unnecessarily
" masalan, ve mahila shashaktikaran or mahila suraksha kii baat karte hai, lekin vastav main endie ne hi is kshetra main kaam kiya he
 From banning triple talaq to punishment of rape of girls
 ''raashtra-virdohi bahesareses kaa maananaa he ki kuch ghatnaon jaise 2016 main jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay kaa vivaad, jiske baad chaatr sangh ke kuch netaaon ke khilaaf deshadroh ke aarope lagaae gaye the, 2017 main desh ke uttari hisse main daliton kii naaraazgi or bhima koregaanv (maharashtra) kii ghatana, ne desh main gahari khai paidaa kar di he
 It feels that the "vague or wavering attitude of many political parties dependent on Muslim voters" has transformed the 2019 Lok Sabha election into a fight between the Sangh and the anti-union forces
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne gwalior main 8, 9 or 10 march ko aresas kii teen divasiy vaarshik pratinidhi sabha main hissaa liya tha, jahaan unhone sangh ke netaaon ke saath do din gupt baithak kii
 To win elections for the BJP, the RSS is planning to field all its organizations for help
 sangh parivaar kii in shakhaon main vanavaasi kalyaan ashram (aresas kaa adivasee sanghathan), bhartiya kisaan sangh (bikees), bhartiya majdoor sangh (bmes), vishwa hindu parishad (viechpi), rashtriya seva bharti (samajasevi sanghathan) or 30 anya chote-chote samooh shaamil hai
 Combining all these, the total number of its members is around 3 to 4 crores, which makes the bjp's election machine extremely powerful
 aresas kii rashtriya str kii ek behad ahm uski prachaar shakha ke pramukh arun kumaar kehete hai, ''yah partiyon ke bich kii ladaai nahin he, balki do vichaardhaaraon ke bich kii ladaai he
 On the one hand there are forces having nationalist ideology and on the other side there are forces governed by foreign thinking
 '' sangh parivaar ke netaaon ko bhi lagata he ki apana adhuraa agenda puraa karne ke liye yah jaruri he ki bhaajapa satta main waapas aae
 The good thing for the BJP is that Prime Minister Modi and Shah's relations with the RSS and its other allied organizations remain very good
 endie-1 ke samay atal bihari vaajapeyi or sangh ke aalaa netaaon ke bich itane achche sambandh kabhi nahin rah paae the
 The move that has made Modi a darling of the Sangh is the strict implementation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) to curb the financial support for Muslim and Christian non-governmental organizations from abroad (of about 11,000 such organizations Licenses could not be renewed)
 is kadam ko badi chaalaaki se dharmanirpeksh rang dene ke liye kuch hindu sanghathanon par bhi is tarah kaa pratibandh laga diya gaya he
 Election Campaign: The Sangh Parivar has adopted a different campaigning strategy so far
 vah modi yaa shah kaa naam khule taur par nahin letaa, isaki bajaay uske kaaryakarta votaron ke paas chaar sawaal lekar gaye—congress ke 60 saal ke shashan main hamane kya paaya he? alpsankhyakon kaa vot paane ke liye vipaksh dharm ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav kyon karata he? ve ayodhya main ram mandir kyon nahin banane de rahe?hamaari simaaon ko surakshit banane ke liye koun-si party zyada sakasham he? jaahir he, ye sawaal nirpeksh votaron ko lakshya karke banaae gaye hai
 Meanwhile, the Sangh's own informal network continues its work by going public
 yah desh main 11 mandal prachaarkon or 42 praant prachaarkon (sangh ne bharat ke sabhi rajyon ko 42 praanton main vibhajit kar rakhaa he) ke jariye sarasanghachaalak se shuru hota he or jamini str tak jaataa he
 An important part of the campaign is to reduce the number of NOTA (invalid vote) votes as an internal analysis found that a major reason for the defeat in the Madhya Pradesh assembly elections was NOTA votes
 aisa lagata he ki bhaajapa ke savarna votaron ne nota kaa prayog kiya tha, kyonki dalit dangon ke baad bhaajapa kii 'aspasht pratikriya' ke kaaran ve apana virodh jaahir karnaa chaahate the, khaskar jis tarah se pichhadon ko lubhaane ke liye dalit-utpeeda virdohi kanoon ko sakht banaaya gaya tha, usase savarnon main naaraazgi thi
 The Sangh Parivar is taking the NOTA issue very seriously
 use dar he ki vampanthi rujhaan vaale enjio ne modi virdohi prachaar shuru kar diya he jisamen ve logon se vipaksh ko vot dene ke liye nahin balki nota ko vot dene ke liye kehete hai, kyonki modi sarkaar ne apane vaadon ko puraa nahin kiya he
 Delhi ABVP general secretary Siddharth Yadav blames the 'urban Naxalites', saying that the Left Front has been using the same strategy for years in its stronghold of Jawaharlal Nehru University
 saboot ke taur par ve bataate hai ki kis tarah nota ke voton kii sankhya congress ke chaatr sanghathan neshnal students union of india (enesuai) ko mili voton se zyada thi
 They say that ABVP is organizing street plays to spread the message of 'building a strong India'
 is chunaav main bhaajapa ko jitaane ke liye aresas kii chunavi ranneeti main abivipi kii bhoomika bahut mahatvapurn rahane vaali he
 The student organization is believed to be active in 10,000 colleges across the country and has around 4,00,000 active members
 abivipi ke rashtriya sanghathan sachiv sunil ambekar garv ke saath kehete hai, ''jab bharat kii yuva raajnneeti main logon kii soch ko badalane kii baat aati he to ham ek badi takat ke rup main saamne aate hai
 The BJP cannot take the help of the RSS in any way lightly
 arun kumaar kehete hai, ''kader anuyaayiyon kii fouj nahin he balki samarpit nagarikon kaa mishran he
 It is our endeavor that people vote 100 percent in the national interest
 '' sangh ke sutara laalkrishna adwani kaa udhaaharan dete hai jo 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav prachaar kaa mukhya cheharaa the, par mohammad ali jinna kii tarif karne ke baad kaadaron se dur ho gaye the
 Sources of RSS philanthropist Seva Bharti, whose 1,60,000 projects are running across the country, say that this organization has also gathered to win the BJP
 sangh se jude anya sanghathanon jaise bikees or bmes bhi kisaan or majdoor nitiyon par modi se matbhedon ke baavjood party kii sahaayta karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 a leader who heads one of these organizations, who is an RSS man, says, "the biggest thing for Modi is that his image is impeccable
" isliye ram mandir jaise mudde gaun ho jate hai
 They have explained to us that the construction of a temple by making laws at this time may backfire
 '' yah alag maamla he ki supreme court ne is maamle ko madhyasthon par chhod diya he
 It is clear that the saffron army is ready to bring Modi and BJP back to power at the Center

 This means to say that when his claim is questioned, he will present evidence in his support

 The party has overcame the controversial statement by former foreign minister Salman Khurshid with the blood stains of Muslims on the Congress
 congress netaa piel puniya ne kaha ki yah salmaan khurshid kii nijee tippanee he
 The Congress party disagrees with his statement
 congress netaa puniya ne kaha ki congress aisi iklauti party he, jisane aazaadee ke pehle or baad samaaj ke sabhi logon ke liye kaam kiya he
 Along with giving equal rights to all, it has stood against divisive forces
 is dauraan rajyasabha main congress saansad piel puniya ne mahilaon ke liye 33 fisadi aarakshan kii bhi maang uthaai
 Discussing the Panchayati Raj system, he said that there is no need for any qualification to contest the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, but there are many conditions to contest the Panchayat elections
 bijepi nahin chaahati ki panchayat raaj sanstha majboot ho
 He said that there are more than thirty-two lakh elected representatives in Panchayati Raj institutions, of which about half are women
 73wein-74wein samvidhan sanshodhan ke baad mahilaon ke pratinidhitiv ko lekar jaagarukta ai he
 About Congress President Rahul Gandhi, he said that he burnt his life in the party and attracted the youth
 puniya ne niti ayog ke siio amitabh kaant ke bayaan kaa zikr karte hue bhi bijepi par karaara hamalaa bolaa
 He said that the CEO of NITI Aayog has said that there is no development work in many nda-ruled states including Chhattisgarh
 unhen sachai bayaan karne ke saath-saath aise rajyon ke liye blue print bhi saamne rakhana chahie tha
 Meanwhile Punia also targeted Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 unhone kaha ki bihar main 15 saal se sushasan babu kii sarkaar he
 Apart from this, BJP has been in government in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh for 15 years
 puniya ne kaha ki centre kii modi sarkaar ne pichde ilaakon ke liye upie sarkaar dwaara chalaai gai yojanaon ko band kar diya
 It is the misfortune of these NDA ruled states

e
 the public money and handing it over to the RSS
 lekin congress ne tatkaal is bayaan kii gambhirtha ko samajhate hue iske video link ko soshal media se hataa liya
 Addressing the Congress Working Committee meeting on Sunday, Rahul Gandhi had said, 'BJP governments are stealing money from the government treasury and giving it to hundreds of RSS organizations
 ' rahul ke bhaashan ko congress ke twitor or utyub acount par bhi share kiya gaya tha, lekin kuch hi minuton ke baad ise hataa liya gaya
 Rahul's statements were certainly provocative to the BJP and RSS and this could again put him in a defamation case
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki bijepi jab bhi satta main aati he, to tamaam rajyon main aresas se judi hajaaron sansthaaen punap jaati hai
 In his speech, Rahul Gandhi criticized the RSS and BJP, but at the same time, told the Congress leaders that they should also learn from these two institutions
 rahul gandhi ne bijepi shasit madhya pradesh, rajasthan aurachhattisgarhrajya kaa ullekh karte hue aarope lagaaya tha ki yahaan kii rajya sarkarein sarkari khajaane kaa paisa chori se shishu mandir skulon sahit aresas kii tamaam sansthaaon ko daan kar rahi hai
 Hundreds of such RSS organizations are running from government money stolen by BJP governments
 rahul gandhi ne yah bhi kaha ki congress kaaryakartaaon ko bijepi or aresas se yah siikhnaa chahie ki samaaj ke vibhinn virgon ko apane saath kaise joden
 Significantly, Rahul Gandhi is already facing a defamation case done by an RSS body in Bhiwandi Maharashtra
 unhone 6 march, 2014 kii ek raily main aarope lagaaya tha ki mahatma gandhi kii hatya aresas ke logon ne kii thi
 a defamation case was registered against him on this speech
 congress shaayad yah nahin chaahati thi ki ab rahul gandhi phir se kisi nae mukademe main fansen, isliye unke bhaashan kaa video soshal media se tatkaal hataa liya gaya

 According to this 28-year-old actress, 'size Zero' is a 'measure' of clothes and she believes in keeping herself fit through exercise, not hunger and looking slim
 ek vyaayaamashaala kaa udghaatan karne yahaan ai diya ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘shaayad ‘sies jiro’ ko lekar hauva khadaa kar diya gaya he
 i think media has a big hand in this
 ’ unhone kaha ki ‘sies jiro’ kapadon kaa ‘naap’ bhar he
 Sometimes a cloth falls on a lean body
 lekin koi jaruri nahin he ki har tarah ke paridhaan ko yah aakaar suut kare
 According to Diya, size zero is a trend that is difficult to maintain in view of health
 unhone kaha, ‘mere khyaal se aaj kii bhagdaud bhari jindagi main jaruri feet rahanaa he, bhookha rahakar dublaa dikhnaa nahin
 Anyway, i think Indian men like slim girls
 ’’diya yaad karte hue kahati hai, ‘‘jab meri pehali film ‘rahanaa he tere dil main’ relies hui to chand logon ne mujhase kaha ki main is film main thodi moti dikh rahi hum
 But surprisingly, some people tell me that i have seen the most beautiful in this film so far
 haalanki, maine baad main vyaayaamashaala main kadi mehnat karke apana vajan ghataya
 "she says with a laugh," Today I'm a size zero, but it doesn't look like this
 ’’ diya ne bataaya ki vah har ravivaar ‘junk food’ khaati hai
 But she cannot promote or encourage such food, because everyone knows that it does not have a good effect on health
 uttar pradesh sarkaar ne mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke khilaaf chal rahe nishedhagna ulanghan ke ek maamle ko waapas le liya he
 The government is preparing to withdraw such cases from about 20,000 leaders-public representatives who were lodged during the agitation and sit-in demonstration
 sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya is aad main sarkaar bijepi ke diggajon ke khilaaf chal rahe cese bhi waapas legi
 Significantly, to prevent organized crime in Uttar Pradesh, the Yogi government introduced a bill of UPCOCA law in the Vidhan Sabha on 21 December
 is bill ke pesh hone ke bich hiupi sarkaar ne yogi adityanath, kendriya mantri, shiv pratap shukla, vidhayak sheethal pandeya or 10 anya ke khilaaf 1995 ke ek nishedhagna ulanghan maamle main dhara188 main lage cese ko waapas lene kaa aadesh jari kar kiya
 According to the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), there are 20 ministers in the UP government, including Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, who have criminal cases against them
 bijepi ke kul 312 vidhayakon main se 114 ke upar aparaadhikmukademe chal rahe hai
 The question is whether the cases against these BJP leaders will also be withdrawn? Of the 312 BJP mlas, 114 have criminal cases against them, out of which 83 have serious criminal cases
 sapa ke 46 main se 14, basapa ke 19 main se 5, congress ke 7 main se 1 par aapraadhik maamle darj hai
 According to the ADR, if you look at the criminal cases registered on the ministers in the Yogi government, then there are 20 ministers who have serious cases
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath par 3 maamle darj hai, jinamein 7 gambhir dhaaraon or 11 ipisi kii anya dhaaraon main hai
 Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Maurya has 11 cases registered against him
 in maamalon main 15 sangeen dharaaen lagi hai or 38 ipisi kii anya dhaaraon main maamle darj hai
 a total of 7 cases have been registered against Nandagopal Nandi, out of which 13 are in serious sections and 9 in other sections of IPC
 iske alaava satpal singh baghel, daara singh, upendra, suresh kumaar rana, surya pratap shahi, bhupendra, girish chandra yadav, manohar laal, brijesh pathak, om prakaash rajbhar, swami prasad maury, reeta bahuguna joshi, anil, ashutosh tandon, dharmpal singh, satishamahana or nilkanth aise mantri hai, jinke upar aapraadhik or ipisi kii anya dhaaraon main maamle darj hai
 In the next assembly session, the Yogi government is preparing to withdraw political cases against about 20 thousand people

 According to the opposition, under the guise of this, the Yogi government will withdraw the cases of its activists and leaders, due to which the law and order has been deteriorating

 Sleep is missing from the eyes of the leaders of Kashmir Valley
 ghati ke netaaon main aisi bechaini he ki jammu-kashmir kii purv mukhyamantri or pipuls democratic party (pidipi) kii adhyaksh mahabuuba mufti ne der raat ko neshnal conference party (ensipi) ke adhyaksh faruk abdulla se mulaakaat kii or ghati ke duusare netaaon ke saath rajyapal se bhi milane pahunchin
 Why is there so much confusion in the valley? Which plan is going on in the mind of Prime Minister Modi and Amit Shah regarding Kashmir? In fact, the deployment of security forces on a large scale in the Kashmir Valley has given sleep to other leaders of the Valley including Mehbooba Mufti
 unhen ashanka he ki ghati main kuch bada hone vaala he
 Mehbooba Mufti met Sajjad Lone and Governor Satyapal Malik on the night itself
 mahabuuba mufti ne kaha ki hamane rajyapal satyapal malik ji se mulaakaat kii or unase afvaahon ko dur karne kaa anurodh kiya, jisaki vajah se ghati main dehshat kaa maahaul bana hua he
 In fact, in view of the terror threat, the government has decided to stop the Amarnath Yatra midway
 amarnath yatriyon ko ghati chhodane kii adwijuri jari kii gai
 At the same time, the presence of security forces in the Kashmir Valley is increasing rapidly
 aise main kashmir ghati kii siyaasi partiyon kii saansen upar neeche hone lagi hai
 Now, the question arises, why did such a situation arise in the Kashmir Valley? Why are the political parties of the valley so restless? In fact, bjp's Kashmir policy Mehbooba Mufti and Farooq Abdullah are well known but the recent deployment of security forces in the Valley has given rumors new wings
 bade paimaan par kashmir ghati main surakshabalon kii teji se badhati maujuudagi ne vahaan ke aam logon kii bechaini bhi badha di he
 At the same time, Governor Malik has advised the leaders to remain calm and ignore the rumors
 rajyapal ne raajnneetik netaaon se apane samarthakon se shanti banaae rakhane or afvaahon par bharosa naa karne kii baat kahi
 It is noteworthy that the Jammu and Kashmir government issued an advisory on Friday, citing intelligence information related to the Amarnath Yatra as a terrorist threat
 isamen paryatakon or amarnath tirthayatriyon ko ghati se jald se jald lautne kii salaah di gai
 The Home Department of Jammu and Kashmir issued this advisory
 adwijuri main kaha gaya ki aatankwaadi dhamkee ke intelegence input, khaas taur se amarnath yatra ko nishaanaa banaae jane or kashmir ghati ke suraksha halaat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue amarnath yatriyon ko ghati se jald se jald lautne ke nirdesh die
 In view of intelligence input, more than 10 thousand paramilitary forces have already reached Kashmir
 adwijuri se kashmir main afra-tafari bhi much gai thi
 But on the second day i

 Police had carried out this operation outside the park, crowded place and school-college to catch the murders

 Former England captain Geoffrey Boycott feels that the Indian team is 'very average' at the moment, but is 'lucky' that he has a captain like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who faced criticism for 'lack of team level'
 Has been doing
 boycott ne kaha, kya aap captainon ko unki jeet or haar ke anupaat se dekhte ho yaa phir aap team ke str ko dekhte ho? agar aap bharat ke bare main soch rahe ho to team main str kii kami he, team main tej gendbaaji ke str kii kami he, spin gendbaaji ke str kii kami he or aapke kuch khilaadi sanyas lenaa shuru kar rahe hai
 is not that so? unhone kaha, ‘rahul dravid or vivies lakshmana ja chuke hai, sachin tendulkar ne haal main zyada ran nahin jutaaye hai to kya yah dhoni kii galati he? boycott ne kaha, mujhe aisa nahin lagata
 i don't judge people by the ratio of winning or losing the team
 aapako team ko dekhnaa hoga
 The Indian team is really lucky to have Dhoni
 england ke khilaaf haal main gharelu test shrunkhlaa main mili haar ke baad dhoni kii kaaphi aalochana ho rahi he, haalanki vah khud acchhee form main hai
 The comments boycott ne kaha ki test captain ke rup main dhoni kii kuch simaaen hai, lekin bharatiyon ke paas uski jagah lene ke liye koi acha khilaadi nahin he
 He said, i think he is a great one-day captain
 bahut logon kii tarah mujhe lagata he ki uske paas khilaadiyon ke kaushal kaa istemaal karne kii acchhee netritvkshmata he, lekin takneekee rup se test maichon main isse kahin thode zyada kii jarurat hoti he, lekin aapke paas uski jagah lene ke liye koi or bhi nahin he
 Boycott said, "you have very good players, but you are very average compared to other world level teams and you cannot win with an average team
" iske liye hameshaa captain ko doshi tehraaya jaataa he
 The captain is praised when the team wins, but i think that is unfair
 unhone kaha ki dhoni ko team ke liye jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa, kyonki bharat aisi team he, jo abhi badlaav ke daur se guzar rahi he
 Boycott said, do you look at the captains in proportion to their wins and losses or do you look at the level of the team? If you are thinking about India then the team is lacking in level, the team lacks the level of fast bowling, the level of spin bowling is lacking and some of your players are starting to retire
 kya aisa nahin he? He said, 'rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman have gone, Sachin Tendulkar has not scored much runs recently, so is it Dhoni's fault? Boycott said, i don't think so
 main logon ko team ke jeetne yaa haarane ke anupaat se nahin aankata
 You have to see the team
 bhartiya team sach main bhaagyashaalee ho ki uske paas dhoni he
 Dhoni has been severely criticized after the recent home Test series loss against England, although he himself is in good form
 tippaniyan Boycott said that Dhoni has some limitations as a Test captain, but the Indians have no good players to replace him
 unhone kaha, mujhe lagata he ki vah shandaar ek divasiy captain he
 Like a lot of people, i think he has good leadership skills to use the skills of players, but technically a little more is needed in Test matches, but you don't have anyone else to replace him
 
 boycott ne kaha, aapke paas kaaphi achche khilaadi hai, lekin duniya kii anya stareey team kii tulana main aap bahut ausat ho or aap ek ausat team ke saath nahin jeet sakate
 The captain is always blamed for this
 jab team jitati he to captain kii prashansa kii jaati he, lekin mujhe lagata he ki yah anuchit he
 He said that Dhoni cannot be held responsible for the team, as India is a team which is going through a phase of change
 unhone kaha, ‘rahul dravid or vivies lakshmana ja chuke hai, sachin tendulkar ne haal main zyada ran nahin jutaaye hai to kya yah dhoni kii galati he? boycott ne kaha, mujhe aisa nahin lagata
