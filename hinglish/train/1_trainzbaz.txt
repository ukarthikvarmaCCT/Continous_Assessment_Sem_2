 yah nivesh bharat nahin aayega
 Now the story
 
 
 ve din tej growth ke the
 a cold evening of January 2006 erupted when the Industry Department announced (single brand) retail foreign investment
 isse pehle khudara kaarobaar main videshi nivesh kaa zikr kufr tha
 The very next year of this statement, in 2007, Walmart came to India with Bharti (airtel)
 walmart ko dekhakar carfu or tesco jaise global retailor bhi aa pahunche
 In 2010, there was an initiative to open multi-brand retail and 51 percent foreign investment opened in 2012 with different conditions, but the Sangh Parivar and BJP created such a movement that foreign investment in retail stopped there
 walmart ne kareeb ek darjan shaharon main thok bikri ke mega store bhi khole lekin videshiyon ke liye multi brands retail par raajnneeti se uubakar walmart ne 2013 main bharti ke saath apana upkram khatm kar diya
 In the midst of this rush, domestic companies were beginning to see an advantage in organized retail
 subhiksha, spencer (arpiji), reliance, mor (birla), iji de (bharti), trent (tata), big bazaar (future) jaise desi retaillers saamne aae or 2010 se 2015 ke bich sangathit retail 21 fisadi kii gati se badaae kii ummid jad pakadaaey lagi
 But they lacked capital for commercial property, new technology and infrastructure, so by 2015 all the stores were closed
 isi dauraan i-commers kii aamad hui
 This business of discount sale on the capital of new rich (venture capital) broke organized retail
 i-commers kii kranti alpajivi thi
 Domestic e-commerce also died in 2017 after conflicting policies and demonetisation and GST
 ab is bazaar main do videshi companiyon—amejan or walmart (flipcart kaa adhigrahan) kaa raaj hoga
 Today, 12 years after the liberalization of retail
 
 
 • khudara kaarobaar kaa aadhunikeekaran kheti, khaadya prasanskaran, nirmaan, menuphaccharing, vittiya sevaaon ko ek saath gati de saktaa tha or prati 200 varg foot par ek rojgaar ke ausat vaala yah kshetra har tarah ke rojgaron kaa ingine ban saktaa tha lekin isamen videshi nivesh roak diya gaya
 • Capital finds its way into the free market
 walmart jis puunji se retail kaa buniyadi dhaancha banaakar rojgaar de sakati thi uske jariye usne pichley daravaaje se i-commers main pravesh kar liya
 Now she will sell goods to consumers, for which she was restrained under foreign investment rules
 i-commers se banane vaale adhiktam nae rojgaar keval courier laane waalon ke honge
 • Food products account for 61% of India's consumption
 rojgaar or upabhokta suvidhaayen badhaane ke liye inke utpaadan or vitaran kaa aadhunikeekaran hona tha lekin yah pichhadaa hi rah gaya he
 It was only the stubborn insistence of the BJP family, due to which the huge retail market could not get the light of modernity and new jobs
 lekin videshi puunji to aa hi gai
 Now a part of this market (e-commerce) is occupied by foreign companies, while the other large part is running old business
 in donon ke bich khadey upabhokta or berozegaar sarkaar ko bisur rahe hai
 Government can still save waste of opportunities through liberalization of multi-brand retail, but why would we? We are a master at missing opportunities

 Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said on Wednesday that the hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru could trigger terror attacks in the state which he is worried about
 umr ne kaha, 'mujhe afjal guru ko faansee par chadaaye jane ko lekar chintit hona padegaa
 Hanging Afzal will create difficulties for both the state and the central government
 'unhone ullekh karte hue kaha ki jammu and kashmir libration front (jexlef) ke netaa mohammad makabool bhatta ko varsh 1984 main faansee kii sajaa dene ke baad kashmir main aatankwaadiyon kii ek fouj taiyaar ho gai thi
 Abdullah said, "I cannot forget that the hanging of Maqbool Bhatt produced an entire generation of terrorists
" mujhe is bare main chintit hona hoga ki afjal guru ko faansee par chadaaye jane se ghati main aatankwaadi ghatnaayen ek phir bad jaaengi jo is samay kaaphi kam hai
 He said, 'I am not in favor of being given the death penalty

 The Janata Dal United (JDU) leader and former Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has questioned the vision document to reserve 85 per cent seats in Delhi colleges only for students in Delhi in terms of education
 nitish kumaar ne ek bayaan jari kar poocha ki agar 85 pratishat siten keval dilli ke vidhyaarthiyon ke liye arakshit ho jaaengi, tab uttar pradesh, bihar, uttar-purv rajyon se aane vaale hazaron chaatro ke bhavishya kaa kya hoga
 Nitish said in his statement, "such a view is a blatant satire on Delhi's mixed culture
 
 
 agar aise niyam-kaayade lagu kiye gaye, to yah chaatro or desh ke liye bijepi kii nakaaratmak soch ko darshata he
 
 
 "nitish asked BJP leaders whether students from outside states did not have the right to study in Delhi, the country's capital
 nitish kumaar ke is bayaan se bijepi netaaon ke liye na sirf bihar, balki dilli main bhi mushkilen badhengi, kyonki chunaav prachaar ke dauraan unhone in rajyon ke kai netaaon, saansadon ko dilli main based bihar or uttar pradesh ke nivaasiyon ko jutaney ke kaam par lagaaya hua he
 Meanwhile, BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain has said that his party will increase the seats in colleges when it forms government in Delhi, but he had no answer on how justice should be done to students from outside Delhi with only 15 per cent seats

 ''matlab?mayawati ne pichley paanch saal main but banane par paisa pani kii tarah bahaya
 They were realizing that the public would also remain idolized, but people beat them up and brought them to the ground
 buton ne mayawati ji ke betahasha julmon kaa hisaab chuktaa kiya he
 But the revenge attitude does not show that she is changing? She is moving among people, it is a very good thing
 janaa chahie
 They should take lessons
 yaad kariye 2007 main unke mukhyamantri banane ke baad kis tarah lakhon juthi exiar raajnneetik virodhiyon ke khilaaf darj karai gayi
 How the police stations of the state were auctioned

 If they take a lesson, it will be a better thing for democracy too

 The Union Minister had told Manoj Tiwari that after a while, Hardeep Singh Puri, a contender for the post of CM, was overturned by his statement, in the midst of the political turmoil of Maharashtra, the political mercury has started climbing in Delhi for the upcoming assembly elections
 dilli bijepi pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari ko dilli ke siem pad kaa daavedaar banane ko lekar bijepi pasopesh main he
 As a result of this, bjp's Delhi Sahibhari and Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri projected Manoj Tiwari as CM face in an event, but turned around shortly
 aise main saaf jaahir he ki bijepi abhi siem chehar ko lekar uljhi hui he
 In fact, before the Delhi Assembly elections, Union Urban Development and Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had put forward the name of BJP state president Manoj Tiwari for the post of Chief Minister
 unhone kaha tha 'ham manoj tiwari ke netritv main aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav ladane ja rahe hai or unhen mukhyamantri banaakar hi dam lenge
 'at the same time, the activists who were enthusiastic, shouted slogans of Abhi Bari, Manoj Tiwari with Jai Shri Ram
 haalanki jab ye maamla tool pakadaa to teen ghante baad hi hardip puri apane bayaan se palat gaye
 Hardeep Puri in his tweet had said in his clarification, 'BJP is heading towards victory in Delhi
 party ne ab tak mukhyamantri pad ke liye kisi ko namit nahin kiya he
 Manoj Tiwari is the state president
 bijepi unke netritv main puure josh se kaam kar rahi he
 In such a situation, the question is what is the reason behind which the BJP is trapped in the dilemma
 manoj tiwari banaam kejariwal banegi?bijepi manoj tiwari ke chehre ko aage chunavi maidan main utregi to dilli kaa siyaasi sangram manoj tiwari banaam kejariwal ke bich hoga
 In such a situation, Kejriwal's face may be overshadowed by Manoj Tiwari
 kyonki kejariwal ne pichley paanch saal main apane kaam ke dam par dilli ke kaddavar chehre ke taur par apni pahchaan banane main kaamyaab rahe hai, jabaki bijepi kii abhi tak kii yahi koshish he ki kejariwal banaam narendra modi ke bich siyaasi sangram ho, taaki party ko jabardast siyaasi phayda mil sake
 Manoj Tiwari, a BJP MP from North East Delhi, is originally from Bihar
 aise main manoj tiwari ke naam purvaanchali vot jahaan ekajute hoga to vahiin punjabi vot ke khisakane kaa bhi bijepi ko dar he
 Punjabi voters are considered very important in Delhi and BJP also has a good hold in them
 aise main bijepi manoj tiwari ko aage kar punjabi votaron ko naaraaz karne kaa jokhim bharaa kadam nahin uthaaegi
 Kiran Bedi's stakes were heavy
 The BJP contested the elections in Delhi in 2015 by contesting the face of former IPS officer Kiran Bedi against Kejriwal of Aam Aadmi Party
 bijepi sansadeey dal board ne kiran bedi ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya tha
 BJP sent Kiran Bedi to Union Minister Dr
 harshavardhan kii seat krishnanagar se chunaav ladaaya tha, lekin unhen haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Not only this, BJP did not get any benefit from contesting elections under the leadership of Kiran Bedi
 bijepi ko mahaj 3 seat hi dilli main mil saki thi, jabaki kejariwal ne jabardast jeet hasil kii thi

 This act would give citizens of India illegal citizens from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, if they belong to Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist, Jain or Zoroastrianism
 yah chah dharm in teen deshon main alpsankhyak hai
 Now this raises the question of how much India has a population of people coming from these countries? India Today Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) analyzed the 2011 census data and found that the number of people born outside India is the population of the country
 0 of 4 pratishat bhi nahin he
 This means that 4 out of every 1000 people are born outside the country
 janaganana ke aankade yah bhi bataate hai ki baahar paidaa hone vaale log koun se desh se aae
 The census shows population from outside in two ways
 ek, jo bharat ke baahar paidaa hue or duusare, jinka pichhlaa awaas bharat se baahar tha
 We looked at the figures of people whose previous residence was in Pakistan or Bangladesh and found that most of their population had already visited India before 1990
 kya kehete hai aankadesaal 2011 kii janaganana ke aankade darshaate hai ki bharat main kul 55 lakh log aise the jinka pichhlaa awaas bharat ke baahar tha jo ki desh kii aabaadi kaa maatr 0
 It is only 44 percent
 inamen se 23 lakh (42 pratishat) bangladesh se aae or 7 lakh (12
 7 percent) came from Pakistan
 afghanistan se aae apravasiyon kii sankhya 6596 hi thi
 It is clear from these figures that 55 per cent of the population coming from outside the country are Pakistani and Bangladeshi immigrants
 in donon deshon se aae log bharat kii kul aabaadi kaa 0
 It is only 24 percent
 janaganana ke aankadon se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki desh main aae apravasi kitne saalon se yahaan rah rahe hai
 This shows to some extent how many people have come to the country from outside
 hamaare vishleshan main paaya gaya ki desh main adhiktam apravasi 1947 ke vibhaajan or 1971 main huebangladeshmukti yuddh ke baad hi aa gaye the
 To know the time of arrival of immigrants before and after 1991, we examined the period of their stay in India during Census 2011
 censos is avadhi ko paanch bhaagon main baantta he - apravasi jinako bharat main rahete hue ek saal bhi nahin hua tha, jo ek se 4 saal se bharat main rah rahe hai, jo paanch se nau saal se bharat main rah rahe the, das se unniis saal se bharat main rah rahe the or 20 se zyada saalon se bharat main rah rahe the
 Assuming 2011 as the criteria, we look at these figures by year
 isse hamen pataa lag jayega 2011 main, 2007 se 2010, 2002 se 2006, 1992 se 2001 or 1991 or usase pehle kitne apravasi bharat main in deshon se aae
 Our assessment found that 76 percent of Bangladesh and 79 percent of Pakistan's immigrant population had arrived before 1990
 saal 1991 ke baad aae in deshon ke apravasiyon kii sankhya 21 pratishat bhi nahin rah jaati
 In 2011 itself, around 22 thousand Bangladeshis entered the country
 yah bangladesh se aae kul apravasiyon kii sankhya kaa ek fisadi bhi nahin he
 In the year 2011, 6405 people came from Pakistan, it is not even one percent of their total population
 bharat main awasasensos ke aankadon main yah bhi bataaya gaya he ki desh main koun se rajya main kahaan ke apravasi rahete hai
 Of the 23 Bangladeshi immigrants, 95 percent live in areas that share a border with Bangladesh
 bangladesh se aae apravasiyon kii sankhya pashchim bengal main 82 pratishat, tripura main 9 pratishat or assam main 3 pratishat he
 28 percent of immigrants from Pakistan live in Punjab, 17 percent in Delhi, 15 percent in Haryana and 9 percent in Rajasthan
 pakistan se aae apravasi maharashtra (8 pratishat) or gujarat (4 pratishat) main bhi rahete hai
 Only 2 percent of Pakistani immigrants live in Jammu and Kashmir
 hamaare akalan main yah bhi paaya gaya ki bangladesh ke apravasiyon ke liye pashchim bengal hi sabase lokapriy jagah tha
 Census Flaws The biggest drawback of census is that it is done every ten years
 isliye hamaare paas aagantukon kii latest sankhya maujuud nahin he
 Although, every person present in the country is counted in the census but it is not clear how many of these immigrants entered the country through illegal means
 july 2019 main grih rajya mantrinityanand raine lok sabha main ek prashn kaa jawaab dete hue kaha tha ki gaiyr kanoonee tareekon se aane vaale apravasiyon kaa koi thos data nahin he
 Number of Refugees The United Nations Commissioner for Refugee (UNHCR) tells us about the number of refugees arriving in the country
 in aankadon main bhi pakistan se aane vaale sharnaarthiyon kii sankhya 1- 4 ke bich hi thi
 Refugees from Bangladesh were not mentioned
 aisa isliye he kyonki mote taur par kisi ko tab rifuji kaa darja diya jaataa he, jab vah apane desh ko chhodkar isliye bhaag rahe hon kyonki vahaan dharm, jaateeyata, raajnneetik kaarnon se unako pratadit kiya ja rahaa tha
 Most immigrants from Bangladesh come to India for economic reasons, so that they cannot be called refuges
 arnigie india kii ek report ke anusaar, zyaadaatar bangladeshi bharat main gaiyr kanoonee tareekon se aate hai, vah bhi chote- mote kaam dhandhe ke liye
 If Bangladeshi are taking refuge, they mostly take refuge in Italy in Europe - this became clear from UNHCR data
 banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay ke sanskrit sankaay main firoz khan kii niyukti ko lekar pichley bavaal ab bhi jari he
 On Thursday, Swami Avimukteshwaranand of Sri Vidya Math reached to meet the students sitting on the dharna of VC residence here

 The result of which is being seen
 sabase badi kamyaabi yah he ki kisaanon kii khudakushi main kami ai he
 In the coming days, the Punjab government is going to provide such a market for farmers, through which farmers will be able to sell their grains directly to other corners of the country
 jakhad ne kaha, 'jab se punjab main aatankwaad kaa kadam padaa, tabhi se maahaul badal gaya
 All the big companies got disenchanted with Punjab
 punjab se sate haryana ke kuch shaharon main log nivesh karne lage
 For this reason, terrorism, which entered Punjab and spread slowly instead of ending

 Only two experts have tasted this burger so far
 vaigyanikon kaa kahana he ki burgers zyada swaadisht nahin hoga
 It has cost £ 2,15,000 (about Rs 2 crore) to build it

 Researchers say that this method may prove to be better in the future given the increasing demand for meat
 yah paryaavaran ke liye bhi thik bataaya ja rahaa he kyonki iske liye jaanwaron ko paalna yaa maarna nahin padegaa
 It is also said to be safe from the point of view of health
 ek tivi channel par prasaarit food sho main ise pakaaya gaya
 Chef Richard mcgowan was supposed to fry Patty on the show
 use frai karte hue unhone burgers ke rang or khashbu par tippanee kii
 He said, 'it is really like cooking another burger, as i have experienced before
 'lekin ek paaramparik burgers kii tulana main iskaa rang brown hone main adhik samay laga
 The butter poured into the frying pan can also be attributed to its browning to some extent

 There is nothing like the intense taste of meat inside it
 yah maance he, soyabean ke nakli maance jaisaa nahin

 Government sources said, "we are considering all options and are also consulting with other co-sponsors"

 India hoped that China would support the resolution in the 1267 Committee of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
 is prastaav se kuch din pehle hi rashtriya jaanch agency (enie) ne pathankot aatanki hamale ke maamle main ajahar ke khilaaf aaropapatr daakhil kiya tha
 Sources said that India has not set any deadline to launch a fresh initiative to declare the Jaish chief as a global terrorist
 ajahar ko lekar bharat ke kadam par china kaa 'takneekee avrodh' 31 disambar ko samaapt ho gaya tha or bharat yaa yuanessi ke kisi anya sadsy desh ko ab nae sire se is sambandh main anurodh karnaa hoga
 The inclusion of Azhar in the list of terrorists by the United Nations committee will require many countries, including Pakistan, to ban Azhar's visit and confiscate his assets
 yuanessi kii 15 sadasyeey samiti main bharat ke anurodh kaa virodh karne vaala china ekmaatr desh tha

 India reacted sharply on December 30 to China's opposition to its proposal at the United Nations, stating that Beijing's decision reflected double standards in the fight against terrorism

 unhone kaha ki ucch nyaayalay ke mukhya nyaayadhish ko chayan samiti se hataaya janaa sarkaar kii niyat par sawaal khadey karata he
 Khanna said that the appointment process of the Lokayukta should be such that no one can raise a finger, while the changes made in the selection committee through the amendment bill, it seems clear that the government wants to make someone of its choice the Lokayukta

 Nagar said, if the farmer wants to go to Rajghat and perform fast, on Gandhi Jayanti, then what is wrong in it
 sawaal he ki kisaan khet ko chhodkar, apni deyari ko chhodkar sadak par kyon aayaa
 It is a matter of thinking
 10 saal puraane tractor yuj karne par pabandi laga di, bijli kaa bill dhai guna badha diya
 Diesel is being charged at Rs 30 to 35 per liter
 kisaan ko uski fasal kaa mulya miltaa nahin
 They talk about paying one and a half times the price of giving the crop, but they buy when the crop of the farmer is sold
 phayda bichauliyon ko ho rahaa he, to kisaan apana dukh-dard sarkaar se kehane nahin aayega, to kahaan aayega
 Nagar said, strict action should be taken against those police officers and all the demands of the farmers should be considered

 Four Indians, including Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati, are included in the list of 'top 50 people in the world who have left their mark on this decade'
 vishwa ke pachaas vyaktiyon kii yah suchi phinanshal times ne taiyaar kii he jisamen anivaasee bhartiya arbapati lakshmi mittal or pepsico kii pramukh indra nui bhi shaamil hai
 Interesting that yesterday in this list
 kaayda pramukh osama bin laden ko bhi jagah di gai he
 The British daily newspaper has written about fifty people that they are not all heroes, but they also have many villains
 phinanshal times kii is suchi main jagah paane waalon main america raashtrapati baraak obama, diggaj niveshak warren bufe, apple ke pramukh steve jabs, golf tiger voods, bill and melinda gates foundation kii melinda gates or chini raashtrapati hu chintaaon shaamil hai
 The newspaper has written that the people in our list have left a deep impression on this decade
 suchi main shaamil anya vyaktiyon main iran ke raashtrapati mahmud ahmadinejad, german chancelar agenla mercel, britain ke purv pradhanmantri tony blair, purv america raashtrapati george bush, roosi pradhanmantri vladimir putin, america fedral rigerv ke pramukh ben es bana’ke pramukh hai
 Regarding Sonia Gandhi, the daily newspaper has written that since 1998, the head of the Congress Party made the Congress the largest political party in the country
 congress ne apni khoi hui siyaasi jameen waapas paane or bijepi ko maat dekar satta main vaapasi ke liye nunatam aay yojana (NYAY) ko manaregaa ke tarj par lagu karne kaa elaan kiya he
 Under this scheme, there is a promise of giving 72 thousand rupees per year, ie 6 thousand rupees per month to about 5 crore poor families of the country
 is nyaay yojana ke jamini rispance se congress gadgad he or wo ise sabase bade chunavi hathiyaar ke taur par apana rahi he
 This is the reason that the Congress has entered the political struggle of the Lok Sabha elections with the slogan 'ab Hoga Nyaya'
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne 25 march ko elaan kiya ki agar centre main congress kii sarkaar bani to desh ke 20 fisadi sabase garib pariwaron ko salanaa 72,000 rupee yani har maheene 6 hajaar rupee bina shart muhaiyaa karaae jaaenge
 It is said that this amount is directly deposited into the account
 rahul ne daawa kiya ki congress kii nunatam aay yojana (nyaay) kaa phayda 5 karod pariwaron yaa takreeban 25 karod logon (prati parivaar 5 log maanakar) ko milegaa
 The Congress is presenting the justice scheme as its biggest promise in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki bijepi ise chunavi propaganda bataakar khaarij kar rahi he
 Not only this, BSP President Mayawati has termed the promise of Congress giving 72 thousand yearly in Saharanpur rally like Narendra Modi's promise of giving 15 lakh rupees
 lekin, jameen par nyaay yojana ko jis tarah se rispance mil rahaa he, usase congress ke hausale bulad hai
 axis-my-india conducted a survey for India Today's Political Stock Exchange (PSE) about the Congress' justice plan
 yojana ke ghoshnaa ke ek hafte se bhi kam ke vakt main congress shasit rajyon main 41% votaron tak pahunch gaya
 In Madhya Pradesh 45%, Chhattisgarh 33%, Rajasthan 45% and Karnataka 37% voters are aware of this scheme
 chaar rajyon main 26% voter aashwast dikhe ki agar congress centre kii satta main aati he to ye party 'nyaay' ko amali jama pehanaane main kaamyaab rahegi
 According to PSE, 42% of the voters are skeptical about the plan taking shape
 vahiin 29% voter is sawaal par spasht raay nahin jataa sake
 Making the basis of the survey, the Congress says that in such a short time, if information of the justice scheme has reached half the people of these states, then in the coming days it will prove to be a game changer for the party
 congress ne daawa kiya ki party par yuddh str par is yojana ko janata ke bich le ja rahi he taaki bijepi kii janvirohi nitiyon kaa jawaab 'nyaay' ke jariye diya ja sake
 According to India Today magazine, it can be said to be the most ambitious and comprehensive social welfare program among the schemes of this type announced so far, according to the journal 'today'
 bhale hi yah abhi chunaav ghoshnaa-patr kaa hissaa ho
 The justice plan announced just 17 days before the first phase of Lok Sabha voting can prove to be a game changer in elections
 rahul gandhi, priyanka gandhi se lekar party ke netaa or kaaryakarta is nyaay yojana ko gaanv-gaanv tak pahunchane main jute hai
 Through the MNREGA, the Lok Sabha election victory in 2009 and last December, the Congress defeated the BJP in three states Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh through farmer loan waiver
 is jeet se utsahit party ne berogari or krishi sankat ke muddon par pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf apane hamalon ko or painaa kar diya he
 On the same lines, Rahul has run a master stroke by announcing the justice plan in the Lok Sabha elections
 raajnneetik panditon kaa pakke taur par maananaa he ki disambar ke vidhansabha chunaavon main kisaanon kii karjamaafee ke vaade ne congress kii sambhaavnaaon ko acha-khaasaa badhaayaa tha
 The bjp's rural seats fell by 31 percent in Madhya Pradesh, 57 percent in Rajasthan and 68 percent in Chhattisgarh
 kisaan karjamaafee kii tarah hi congress kii nyaay yojana sabase zyada gramin or ardh-gramin vaali siton ko prabhavit kar sakati he
 Of the 513 Aslok Sabha constituencies in rural areas that were classified on the basis of 2011 census data, at least 290 are rural and 131 are semi-rural constituencies
 gramin nirvachan kshetra ve hai, jahaan shahari aabaadi 25 fisadi se kam he, jabaki ardh-gramin nirvachan kshetra ve hai jahaan shahari aabaadi 25 fisad se zyada magar 50 fisad se kam he
 Let us know that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won 156 rural and 69 semi-rural seats
 duusare lafjon main uski jiti 282 siton main 80 fisad gramin or ardh-gramin ilaakon se ai thim
 Whereas out of the total 44 seats won by Congress, 32 were rural and semi-rural seats
 loksabhaa siton kii taadaad ke lihaaj sheersh paanch main se teen rajyon main, bahut bada hissaa gramin or ardh-gramin siton kaa he
 Uttar Pradesh has 74 such seats out of 80, Maharashtra 33 out of 48, West Bengal 32 out of 42, Bihar 39 out of 40 and Tamil Nadu 23 out of 39 such seats
 congress kii yah yojana bijepi ke liye raajnneetik mushkilen badha sakati he
 Interestingly, the scope of 'justice' is not limited only to rural areas but can also show this effect in urban and tier-2 areas
 zamin par is yojana ko lekar congress maahaul banane main juty he
 It is also getting good response, due to which the Congress has given the slogan 'ab Hoga Nyaya' through this scheme
 is naare ke jariye jahaan is yojana kaa sandesh dena he
 At the same time, the Congress is also trying to tell that injustice has been done to the people of the country during the last five years of BJP rule

 chaatr isi masale ko lekar naaraaz hai
 Some faculty members including students, on the condition of anonymity, said that by delaying in this way, they are trying to irregularize the academic session
 tippaniyan Some faculty members even went so far as to say that it has become like a fight between two factions, here the interest of the students has been left far behind
 pehla gut vah he jo niyamit kakshaon ko band karwaanaa chahta he, kyonki ve class lene ke liye raji nahin hai, doosraa gut vah he jo niyamit kakshaon ko jari rakhana chahta he
 The students in these two factions are fighting

 desh kii sabase badi adaalat ne lagaataar do aise faisle die hai jinaki bahut hi zyada jarurat thi
 The first is that the arrest in dowry matters is only when necessary and the second is about fatwas
 dahej kanoon kai saal pehle desh main dahej ke kaaran ho rahi mauton ko dekhte hue banaaya gaya tha
 Lawmakers and the public were of the opinion that cases of dowry harassment have increased surprisingly and strict laws are needed to diagnose and prevent them
 iske baad yah kanoon banaaya gaya
 But unfortunately that law was so misused that the matter reached the Supreme Court and it ruled that arrest should be made in such cases only when it is needed
 yani ki aisa lage ki aaropee us maamle main gavaahon par dabaav daal rahaa ho yaa vah koi or aparaadh kar rahaa ho yaa phir faraar hone kii taiyarimen he
 Actually, due to the strict law in cases of dowry harassment, the police arrest all those whose names are in the FIR
 vaise logon main kai baar bahut buudhe log, duusare shaharon main rah rahe log or yahaan tak ki enarai bhi lapete main aakar jail pahunch gaye
 Due to the lack of immediate bail provision in this law, people make it a weapon and sometimes with the intention of seeking revenge, they put names of many people who are not directly connected with that crime
 yah dekhte hue ki dahej pratadna ke maamalon main sirf 15 pratishat logon ko hi sajaa milti he, adaalat kaa yah faisla saraahneey he
 This will save innocent people from going to jail unnecessarily and the number of people filing the case will also fall as those who make false complaints will also be discouraged
 fatvon se judaa supreme court kaa faisla bhi is myne main behad mahatvapurn he ki desh main iskaa kaaphi chalan rahaa he
 In many cases of minorities, at times the cleric or institution issues edicts which are quite controversial
 ye ek tarah se swatantra adaalat chalaane jaisaa he
 Therefore, the Supreme Court has banned them and said that it is not necessary to obey them and Sharia courts in the country do not have legal recognition
 use raay dene kaa haq to he lekin vah kisi ke moulik adhikaron kaa hanan nahin kar saktaa he
 It does not entitle anyone to issue a fatwa about someone who is not in front of them and the fatwa should not hurt anyone innocent
 yah faisla bhi fatve par kai varshon se chal rahe vivaad kaa ant kar degaa or ek swasth parampara ko janm degaa jisamen begunaah pratadit nahin honge
 The dowry law case was also strange
 ek kanoon jo nirdosh logon kii raksha ke liye banaaya gaya tha, vah anyaay kaa astr ban gaya tha or najaane kitne begunaahon kii bali le rahaa tha
 This is also a sad tale of misuse of laws in India
 ab supreme court ke is fasale se isamen brake lagegaa or dusron ko fansaane yaa pareshaan karne kii maansikta par roak lagegi

 Although Phoolchand was angry at first, but later thought of getting a second marriage with his lover
 pradhan ko bulaakar tay karvaa di shaadiphoolchand ne kaha, 'meri shaadi chandaa se hui thi maine sochaa kii usko kitni khushiya duun lekin vah usase santusht nahin hui
 She loves Suraj, so thinking that i am getting her married
 maine khud suraj ko phone karke bulaayaa or pradhan ko bulaakar shaadi pakki kii
 'it was not easy, it was not so easy for Kampoolchand, but to the delight of his wife, he strangled his feelings
 gaanv ke pradhan or kuch anya logon kii madad se suraj ke gharrishte kii batpahunchaai
 Suraj's marriage came to the village of Phoolchand and then both were married with pomp in a village temple
 suraj ke pita mata prasad ne kaha ki unka ek hi betaa he
 He would do anything for her happiness

 The Asia Cup 2018 Super-4 match between Team India and Afghanistan will be played at Dubai International Stadium from 5 pm today
 abhi tak lagaataar 4 match main jeet hasil karne vaali bhartiya team ke saamne afghanistan jaisi ulatpher karne main maahir team hogi
 Rohit Brigade will also aim to beat Afghanistan in the current tournament to punch the victory
 form main he team indiyabharat ne super-4 ke apane abhi tak ke donon match jitkar final main jagah pakki kar lee he
 However, he cannot take Afghanistan lightly in this match
 kyonki bharat har tarah se apane vijayi kram ko jari rakhane kii koshish karegaa taaki final main vah sakaaratmak maansikta ke saath jaae
 At the same time, this match is a battle of credibility for Afghanistan
 vah is match ko jitkar toornament kaa vijayi ant karnaa chahega
 On 26 September, Pakistan and Bangladesh teams will clash in Abu Dhabi
 afghanistan kii team ankatalika main apane donon match haar kar bina kisi ank ke sabase neeche he
 Pakistan and Bangladesh both have two points each
 aise main agar afghanistanjit bhi jaataa he to uski final main jane kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Because on the other hand, the team that will win in Pakistan and Bangladesh will be in the final and if the match is canceled, then both the teams will get one point and then based on the net run rate, the team that leads will play the final
 is pikchar main afghanistan match jeetne ke baad bhi final kii res main nahin he
 Both his batting and bowling are going well for India so far, but the Indian batsmen have to be careful in this match as Afghanistan have the best spin bowling attack of all time
 uske paas mujeeb ur rahamaan, raashid khan or mohammad nabi kii tigadi he jo kisi bhi ballebaaji akraman ko dhwast kar sakati he
 Together, these three not only take wickets but also curb runs
 isi tigadi ke dam par afghanistaanne srilanka or bangladesh ko maat di thi
 In the last two matches also, against Pakistan and Bangladesh, these three had given the match to their team
 haalanki ant main anubhav kii kami ke kaaran afghanistan donon match haar gai
 In such a situation, Indian batsmen will have to be careful against these three and get down with special strategy
 bharat ke liye acchhee baat yah he ki uske captain rohit sharma or upakptain shikhar dhawan donon kaa balla jamkar bol rahaa he
 Both have scored centuries against Pakistan in the last match
 yah donon lagaataar acchhee paariyaan khel rahe he
 Apart from these two, however, no other batsman has got much opportunity to spend time at the crease
 ambati raidu jarur tisare number par aakar acha yogadan de rahe hai
 At the same time, Rohit is constantly experimenting with the fourth number
 is number par rohit ne dinesh karthik or mahendra singh dhoni ko bhi utaara he
 Not batting much for the rest of the batsmen can be a negative aspect of India against Afghanistan
 agar rohit or dhawan jaldi out ho jate hai, to puraa daaromadar madhyakram or nichle kram par aa jayega
 However, Rayudu, Dhoni, Karthik and Kedar Jadhav all have the ability to rescue the team from the crisis
 afghanistan ke liye raah aasaan nahinvahin bhartiya gendbaajon kii baat kii jaae to uske liye afghanistanke kuch hi ballebaaj chintaa kaa sabab ban sakate hai
 Hasmatullah Shahidi, Captain Asghar Afghan, Ihsanullah and Mohammad Shahzad are the main batsmen of Afghanistan
 in chaaron ko agar bhartiya gendbaaj jaldi out kar lete hai, to afghanistan ko ek achche score tak pahunchane se roka ja saktaa he
 In the last few matches, Rashid Khan has played good innings with the bat as well and he can also plague the Indian bowlers
 bharat ke liye paas haalanki bhubaneshwar kumaar or jasprit bumraah jaise tej gendbaaj hai jo team ko adhiktar maukon par shuruaati safalataa dilaate aae hai
 In the middle overs, the trio of Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal can prevent Afghanistan from scoring a good score
 bharat ko ek baat dhyaan rakhni hogi ki agar afghanistan pehle ballebaaji karata he to use 250 tak nahin pahunchane de kyonki afghanistan ne kai maukon par is lakshya kaa majbootee se bachaav kiya he
 Of course the Indian team management would have noticed this and advised that Afghanistan should be stopped at about 200
 donon timen-bharat:rohit sharma (captain), shikhar dhawan (upakptain), lokesh rahul, ambati raidu, manish pandey, kedaar jadhav, mahendra singh dhoni, dinesh karthik, deepak chahar, kuldeep yadav, yujavendra chahal, rabindra jadeja, bhubaneshwar kumaar, jasprit bumraah, siddharth kaul or khalil ahamed

 This was the routine of rebel poet Ramashankar Yadav 'rebel'

 Under this movement, after returning from a protest march organized till Jantar Mantar, he slept and remained asleep

 He used to register a strong presence in the movements during his student life in Sultanpur
 grajuation ke baad vidrohi ne sultanpur ke kamala nehru institute main elelbi main daakhila liya, lekin padhai puri na kar sake

 unako aam chaatro ne apni aawaaj ke taur par pahachaanaa tha or ve chaatro kii jindagi kaa hissaa ban gaye the
 The rebel had said about this, 'JNU has a rich tradition of movements

 What else is needed in this situation? ' Separated from his wife Shanti Devi and children, JNU was made his home, the rebel said, 'I was able to keep my attitude because Shanti kept me free from family responsibilities
 ’ve andolanon ke bich rah kar kavita rachate the, isliye unki kavitaayen sidhe janata se judi hai
 Rebellion was their base

 sarkaar ne achche din kaa naaraa diya tha lekin us naare kaa kya hua
 Whose good days did the situation of farmers improved, unemployment decreased, suicides decreased in the country
 vah naaraa hawa ho gaya
 Now a new slogan is being coined
 lekin iskaa koi phayda nahin hoga
 These questions were raised by CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury
 He was answering the questions of TVTN Consulting Editor Rajdeep Sardesai in Aaj Tak's security meeting
 yechuri ne ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki modi varsej ol kaa nerrative bijepi kii taraf se khadaa kiya ja rahaa he or media unki jaal main funs rahi he
 He also reminded Rajdeep by example that after 2004, you had asked me what the alternative of Vajpayee was and i had said that the choice would be given by the public
 india shining ke naare hawa ho gaye or desh ne vikalp diya
 Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister of the country for 10 consecutive years
 isi tarah is baar bhi desh kii janata vikalp degi
 Yechury said that there are many questions in the mind of common man whether good days come
 unhone bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko aade haathon lete hue kaha ki yah unka hi kahana tha ki jumala
 Yechury said that such utterances are spoken a lot but the public does not vote on the basis of this
 janata ke man main moolbhit sawaal hote hai
 Similarly, the public is considering this time how much its conditions have improved, has the government done anything for the farmers
 yah inhi kaa vaada tha ki emspi dedh guna kii jaaegi lekin kya iskaa paalan kiya gaya
 On the question that there is no pre-election alliance
 pradhanmantri aapke gathbandhan ko mahamilawat kehete hai
 On this, Yechury said that in 1971 also after the elections, an alliance was formed
 1996 main bhi chunaav ke baad gathbandhan bana tha
 NDA was formed only after the elections in 1998
 2004 main bhi chunaav ke baad hi upie bana tha
 Similarly, this time the option will be ready after the election
 vipaksh ke gathbandhan ko mahamilawat kehane par yechuri ne kaha ki yah desh hi milawat he
 There is adulteration from Jammu Kashmir to Kerala to Bengal
 to kya ise mitaakar unifarmity laana chaahate ho
 This politics is not mathematics
 2 plus 2 main 22 bhi ho saktaa he or jiro bhi
 This election will be held between the policy of the government and the people that how much better our life has been in 5 years
 pulavama balakot ke baad sab badal gaya he is par unhone kaha ki yah media ko lag rahaa he
 Ask common people how their life is going
 tab vah aapako batayega ki us par kya guzar rahi he
 Are the unemployed getting employment
 unhone sarkaar par kataaksh karte hue kaha ki aakhir infrastracchar majboot kyon nahin kiya jaataa jisase logon ko rojgaar mili
 Uttar Pradesh city development minister Azam Khan said that the central government should give economic package to Uttar Pradesh as per its right
 package dene main hi congress kii bhalaai he
 During a conversation in Lucknow, Azam said, 'if you have to give, then the Center should give compensation according to the right of Uttar Pradesh
 congress kii bhalaai uttar pradesh ko uskaa package dene main hi he
 As far as the law and order of the state is concerned, it is absolutely correct
 'barsaat kii shuruyaat hote hi kray kendron ke baahar rakhe gehun ke bhigane ke sawaal par ajam ne sara thikra centre sarkaar par hi phoda
 He said that the wheat outside the purchasing centers is getting wet due to the central government
 gehun ko bachaane ke liye rajya sarkaar apni taraf se bharpoor prayaas kar rahi he
 Azam said that it is the responsibility of the Center, not Uttar Pradesh, to save the wheat from getting wet
 centre ko apana kaam karnaa chahie

 unki akut daulat or oonchi rajnatik paith ke bare main kisi ko kabhi galatfahami nahin rahi
 Many documents of his black exploits have been lying in the Chief Minister's Office, CBCID, Income Tax Department and Enforcement Directorate for years
 iske baavjood unki sehat par koi fark nahin padaa
 When Mayawati was in power in Uttar Pradesh, she was the Chief Engineer of the Noida Authority and earned a lot of money
 2012 main akhilesh yadav kii nai sarkaar ai or us par shikanja kasne kaa naatak hua
 There was also a CBCID investigation, but they got a quick clean chit

 After all, someone eats only a little money, there will be some political mentor to whom a large portion of the bribe money reaches
 unki badi-badi kothiyon ke photo dekhne ko mili
 10 crore from the favorite expensive car trunk
 nakad nikalate bhi logon ne dekhe
 In such a situation, it seems that a very corrupt fish has caught the handle of the Income Tax Department
 lekin na to ve ab tak giraftaar hue hai or na maujuuda halaat main unke giraftaar hone kii sambhaavna he
 Under the provisions under which the Income Tax Department is taking action, Yadav Singh will have to pay a maximum of 30% tax on his black earnings and nothing more
 uske baad ve phir se safedposh ban jaaenge
 They will go to jail only when the Enforcement Directorate (ED) starts acting on them after the new FIR
 yaa phir kisi tarah ve kaledhan par supreme court kii ore se banaae gaye vishesh jaanch dal (esaity) ke radar par aa jaaen
 That is why Yadav Singh is trying to put the Uttar Pradesh government vigilance inquiry against him before the ed's action so that the matter does not go out of the corridors of Lucknow
 kyonki isse pehle bhi 950 karod ru
 They have been accused in the Noida land scam
 lekin tab unhone ek netaa ko is baat ke liye manaa liya ki jaanch rajya sarkaar kii sibisiidi kare taaki maamla aasaani se sulat jaae
 a CBCID official says that in return for the deal, the leader was gifted a hotel in Noida Sector 37, worth crores of rupees
 bataai jaati he
 (in the reign of Mayawati, Yadav Singh was accused and accused and was acquitted during Akhilesh's tenure) Says a police officer who was involved in the investigation of land scam against Yadav Singh in 2012, "his political influence is It was so important that even his senior officers did not question his decisions
 is tarah ve apane logon ko beshkeemtee jameen maati ke mol aavantit karte rahe
 This also indicates that he was also benefiting his senior officers and political masters

 Yadav Singh, a diploma holder in electrical engineering, started a job as a junior engineer in 1980 at the Noida Authority
 1995 main pradesh main pehali baar jab mayawati sarkaar ai to 1995 main 19 ejiniyaron ke pramotion ko darkinar kar sahaayak project ejeeniyar ke pad par tainaat yadav singh ko project ejeeniyar ke pad par pramotion de diya gaya
 He was also given three years time to pursue a degree
 varsh 2002 main yadav singh ko noida main chif mentinence ejeeniyar (siemai) ke pad par tainaati mil gai
 For the next nine years, he remained in the post of CME, which was the largest post of engineering department in the authority
 is vakt tak athurity main siemai ke teen pad the
 Yadav Singh was not satisfied with this
 unhone kai pad khatm karakar apane liye ejineering in chif kaa pad banwaaya
 That is, the governments were present to present what they wanted
 (yadav singh kii noida vaali kothi, jahaan iskar vibhaag ne chapa maaraa)lekin kyon? iskaa jawaab dete hai bijepi saansad kirit somaiya, jinhone november 2011 main is maamle ko sabase pehle uthaaya tha
 (see conversation) Chartered accountant Somaiya by profession shows the evidence of Yadav Singh's fake companies and their overnight increasing turnover, showing that Yadav Singh is an arriving player
 unhone benami companiyon kaa jaal buna he
 Starting from a few hundred rupees, these companies make crores of rupees in a few years
 kaa kaarobaar karne lagati hai
 Most of the companies are owned by his wife Kusumlata, son Sunny and daughters Karuna and Garima
 koi company aisi nahin he jiskaa maalik yadav singh khud hon
 One of these companies is Chahat Technology Pvt
 li
 The office of this company is shown at 612, Gobind Apartments, B-2, Vasundhara Enclave, Delhi 96
 iske malikan main yadav singh kii patni kusumlataa bhi shaamil hai
 The total assets and turnover of this company stood at Rs 1,856 in 2007-08
 or ped ap capital 100 ru
 was
 lekin ek saal main hi is company ne aisa kaarobaar kiya ki ped ap capital 1 lakh ru
 And the company's net fixed assets5
 47 karod ru
 happened
 yani hajaar ru
 The company became a company of five crores in a year
 ek or company he kusum garments pra

 Yadav Singh's wife, both daughters and sons are directors in this company
 2007 main is company kaa turnover 2,300 ru
 And paid up capital of Rs 100
 thi
 The next year, the company has a market value of Rs 2 crore
 ho gai
 According to the Income Tax Department, there are more than 40 companies named after Kusumlata alone
 (dekhen graphic) inamen se zyaadaatar companiyaan 2007 main yani mayawati sarkaar banane ke baad vajood main ain
 Not only this, so far 67 companies have been detected in the name of wives of different officers of Noida Authority
 yani benami companiyon kaa chaska sabko he
 (yadav Singh's plush house on Nandpura, Deori Road, Agra) Yadav Singh is alert in these circumstances
 chahat technology privet li
 Today, only the names of Rajendra Kumar Manocha and Namrata Manocha are visible in the directors of
 yadav singh kii zyaadaatar companiyon ke diarector ke taur par isi dampati kaa naam he
 10 crore when Yadav Singh's bungalow in Noida was raided by the Income Tax Department
 nakad vahaan maujuud rajendra manocha kii gaadi kii dikky se hi mili the
 Yadav Singh has now made Manocha his business mask
 duusari taraf is tarah kii baat bhi joro se kahi ja rahi he ki yadav singh ne apni patni ko talakshuda bataa rakhaa he
 In such a situation, how will they be responsible for someone's wrongdoing? On this complicated matter, former CBI Director Joginder Singh says, "this case is about corruption going on in government scrutiny
" yadav singh ke khilaaf aapraadhik maamla darj hona chahie or faisla aane tak sampatti jabt kar leni chahie
 "but Yadav Singh, who was earlier close to BSP and now SP, has many ideas
" jisaki pehali nazeer mayawati ke chote bhai anand kumaar hai
 The Income Tax Department then took action on the complaint against Anand and Anand's Rs 400 crore
 kii jaaydaad jabt kar lee
 But in November 2013, the Income Tax Department came to the conclusion that all the companies associated with Anand have paid proper taxes
 iske baad anand ke jabt kiye gaye 400 karod ru
 They were returned
 ab yadav singh ke maamle main bhi karrwai usee disha main badhati dikh rahi he
 The statement of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav adds further strength to Andeshe
 akhilesh ne itnaa kaha, ‘‘iskar vibhaag maamle kii jaanch kar hi rahaa he
 There is also ED to investigate
 ye donon rajya sarkaar se badi jaanch agenciyaan hai
 The state government will take any action against Yadav Singh only after the report of the Income Tax Department
 ’’udhar, iskar vibhaag ke sutara bataate hai ki yadav singh kaa passport jabt kar liya gaya he
 It was feared that he could flee to Nepal or Malaysia, where he was allegedly financed
 is bich iskar vibhaag ko do samvedansheel diariyaan bhi mili hai
 The first diary was found from his Noida home, in which he mentions his illegal transactions
 duusari diary dilli ke ek bank ke loker se mili
 This diary contains detailed accounts of Yadav Singh's dealings with some business houses
 ity nideshak (investigeshan) ashok kumaar treepathi ne kaha, ‘‘yadav singh or unke share holders ne ab tak 50 karod ru
 Have confessed to being black money
 jald hi ham unke loker kholenge or vahaan se or jaankaree milane kii ummid he
 "the effect of this pressure is that Yadav Singh's elder brother Kapoor Singh attacked the journalists who reached his house in Agra

 kepaining ke rang campus main jahaan-tahaan najar aa rahe hai
 But it is equally important to take care of the guidelines in the student election as campaigning
 har chaatr sangh chunaavon se pehle college ja-ja kar chaatro tak pahunchane kii harsambhav koshish main laga hua hai
 But the first condition of Guidelines and NGT is paperless campaigning
 lekin campus main har jagah is guidelins kaa dhadlle se ulanghan ho rahaa he
 Pamphlets and posters sticking to walls and pillars everywhere are proof of this
 lekin chaatr dalon kaa kahana hai ki unke paas koi doosraa vikalp nahi he
 Administration should give other options NSUI National President Amrita Dhawan says that if the administration wants paperless publicity, it should also give us other options to reach out to the students
 jaise har college main aadha ghanta interection kaa time or wal of demokrasi jaisi sahuuliyat de taaki ham chaatro tak pahunch saken
 It is also forbidden to put up posters on trains, as per the guidelines, campaigning by pasting posters on vehicles is also prohibited
 lekin gadiyon par bhi sambhavit ummidavaaron ke naam chipkaakar campaning chaalu he
 Parties in student politics can campaign as much as possible through social media
 taaki chunaav prachaaron ko paperles banaaya ja sake
 But the student parties argue that it is not easy to reach 50 college children and that is why they are forced to use paper
 sabhi dalon ne paperles raajnneeti ke liye ranneeti to banaai he lekin jamini taur par iskaa koi asar najar nahin aa rahaa he

 Explain that before becoming the Governor of Mizoram, Kamala Beniwal was the Governor of Gujarat and there was a lot of controversy between her and the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi over the appointment of the Lokayukta
 ullekhneey he ki gujarat kii rajyapal rahete hue beniwal ke us samay rajya ke mukhyamantri rahe narendra modi, jo vartmaan desh ke pradhanmantri he, ke saath madhur sambandh nahin rahe the

 tanushri datta ne # metoo campagne ke tahat naanaa patekar par chhedchhad karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Many big stars came in support of Tanushree Dutta after the matter caught fire, but on the other hand they have filed a defamation suit against Rakhi Sawant for the comments made about her
 raakhi saavant kaha tha ki tanushri drugs lekar apni vine main padi hui thim
 i had to do his song at the behest of Nana
 ab raakhi saavant ke is ravaiye ke khilaaf tanushri ne kadaa kadam uthaaya he
 Tanushree Dutta has demanded Rs 10 crore along with a case of defamation against Rakhi Sawant
 jaaniye raakhi ne tanushri ke khilaaf apane intervyuu main kya kaha tha
 
 
 In an interview in the last days, Rakhi Sawant said, "I replaced Tanu in the song" Horn Ok Please "
 " raakhi ne bataaya, "tanu ne film ke gane ko shoot kiya tha lekin use bich main chhod diya
 After that i got a call from choreographer Ganesh Acharya, he just said, come on set, you have to sing
 " raakhi ne kaha, "unki baat sunakar main hairaan rah gai kyonki achaanak koun sa gaanaa?" ganesh acharya ne bolaa, "bas raakhi tum aa jaao, gaanaa maine banaaya he, abhi shoot karnaa he
 Rakhi told, i also got a call from Nana Patekar
 wo bolne lage ki tum gaanaa kar do
 When i heard this, i reached the set immediately
 "rakhi told that after reaching the set i came to know that the song is from Tanushree
 wo is gane ko thodaa shoot kar chuki hai lekin lekin ab wo kooperate nahin kar rahi he
 Right now she is in her vanity, where she has gone to call him all but she is not coming out
 iske baad raakhi ne kaha, "us vakt daiji shah master ji kii assistant thi or usne sari baat bataai ki wo khud tanushri ko bulaane 10 baar gayi thi lekin unhone darwaja nahin kholaa
 "rakhi said," Nana Patekar said to me, no matter how you handle everything because there is such a big set, there are more than 100 dancers
 produsar kaa paisa laga he, wo mar jayega
 Rakhi said, when i heard everything, i myself went to call Tanu but she did not come
 phir maine unke hair dreser or mechap artist ko phone kiya
 Then i came to know the real reason "rakhi Sawant revealed," Tanu was unconscious in the van carrying drugs for 4 hours that day
 tanu aaj badi-badi baaten kar rahi hai
 But i want to tell their reality to everyone
 raakhi ne kaha, jab maine tanu kaa gaanaa kiya to unhone mujhe notice bhi bheja
 But the film's team rescued me and said that Rakhi has helped us at the last moment "what is the whole matter? Tanushree has accused Nana Patekar of profanity and molestation during the shooting
" unhone 2008 main ek film kii shooting ke dauraan naanaa par apane saath jor jabardastee kii koshish kaa aarope lagaaya
 He had said, "nana Patekar wanted to forcibly get closer, he was not a part of the song during the shooting, though he tried to get intimate with him
" gane ke koreagrapher ganesh acharya, diarector rakesh saarang or produsar sami siddiki sab is baat se waakif hai, lekin kisi ne kuch nahin kiya
 Tanushree said that Nana used to beat heroines
 industry main har kisi ko maaloom he ki heroinon ko lekar wo hameshaa se hi aise rahe hai
