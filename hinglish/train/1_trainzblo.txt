 The High Court said on the SIT report that prima facie we agree
 prashanth pandey pen driev lekar dilli hai court chale gaye
 The Madhya Pradesh government said that the pen drive is fake and we do not need it
 dilli hoicourt ne pen driev jabalpur hai court ko de di
 Two weeks ago, the pen drive that the STF had rejected asked the court to give it to us
 court ne emicas cure se is bare main raay maangi jo buudhvaar ko jamaa kar di gai he
 The Jabalpur High Court can give its verdict on this on 20 July

 On 6 July 2013, 6 solvers are captured from a hotel in Indore
 solver use kehete hai jo hote to doctor hai lekin paise lekar duusare rajyon main kisi ke badale imtahaan de aate hai
 When the police raided, these solvers got hammered and the distinction started to open
 lekin 9 din baad vyaapman ke nattejey ghoshit kar diye gaye
 After the results on 13 July, the same night, the mastermind of Solver scam Jagdish Sagar was also arrested, but even then the government started the counseling process for admission and completed it quickly
 sarkaar ne chaatro se halafanama lekar admician kar liya ki bhavishya main doshi paae gaye to namakan radd samajha jayega
 Why did the Chief Minister not conduct the exam again
 vyaapman ke adhikariyon ke kilaaf kab or kya karrwai kii
 Despite his strictness, his former PA and State Backward Commission members are still absconding
 aapako punam sharma kii ek kahani bataata hum
 When the scam came to light in July, Poonam Sharma and some students went to court to cancel the examination but kept waiting for the decision

 Meanwhile, even after the arrest of Jagdish Sagar, the government started the counseling process for admission
 chaatro se halafanama le liya ki bhavishya main doshi paae gaye to namakan radd mana jayega
 In October 2013, 135 suspected students were fired
 tab punam jaise kuch parikshaarthi maang karne lage ki unki jagah duusare chaatro kaa namakan hona chahie
 Poonam Sharma was not far from the rank at which admission was closed
 wo supreme court tak gai lekin tab tak namakan kii aakhri taarikh 30 sitambar biit chuki tha
 In December 2013, Poonam and some of the examinees also went on hunger strike
 kismat acchhee thi ki 2014 kii pravesh pariksha sibiesai ke eipamti se karai gai
 Poonam again became a doctor
 ek sipaahi kii beti or paanch bahanon main se ek punam zarur acha doctor banegi
 But who will listen to the stories of the children who were ruined
 aisa hi ghotaalaa 2010-11 main chhattisgarh main bhi khul chukaa tha
 You can also see the news published in Wednesday's Raipur Dainik Bhaskar
 bilaspur ke paas takhtpur kii ek dharmashala main bachche or unke matapita parchaa bhar rahe the
 According to Bhaskar, 13 lakhs were taken from every student for leaking the form and there was a loss of eight crores in one night
 vyaapman kii jaanch kar rahi team ab chhattisgarh main bhi haath paanv maar rahi he ki kahin uskaa sambandh vyaapman se to nahin tha
 It cannot be that the scam that was going on in Madhya Pradesh with political patronage was being done in Chhattisgarh by the grace of God
 agast 2013 main siaidi ko ek gupt chitthee mili ki chhattisgarh ke medical collejon main doctorl kii padhai kar rahe kai chaatr piemti main shaamil nahin hue the
 The names of the students were given in that letter and it was said that someone else had taken the exam instead
 siaidi ne jaanch kii to 2007 se 2010 ke bich 45 farji ummidavaar saamne aae
 Only 25 challans have been produced against them and the police have not been able to arrest one and a half dozen accused students
 donon hi sarkarein 2010-11 main shant raheen
 During this time such cases had also come up in Madhya Pradesh
 mukhyamantri raman singh ko bhi bataanaa chahie ki unhone kya kiya or unki police kis nattejey par pahunchi he
 Whose children were enrolled in Chhattisgarh? dainik bhaskar kii khabar main yah bhi he ki kuch chaatr zamaanat par reeha hokar waapas padhane to chale gaye lekin pichley paanch saat saalon main ek do saal kii padhai bhi puri nahin kar paae hai
 Now come on Kamal Khan's report
 hamaare netaa afasar or giroh mil jaae to kya nahin kar sakate hai bas aapke kisi honhaar bachche ko hameshaa ke liye barbaad hona padegaa
 Look at these posters of Wattend in medical colleges of UP
 ye kathith rup se solver hai jinaki talash madhya pradesh kii estf kar rahi he
 Most of the nearly 200 solvers belong to up's medical college
 estf ko kanpur medical college ke 58 chaatro kii talash he jin par paise lekar duusare ke badale pariksha dene kaa andeh he
 Out of these 23 students were also arrested and released on bail and came to college
 kuch abhi bhi jail main hai or kuch faraar
 If he had passed, he would have become a doctor, but the trust of money and political power made him a criminal
 mainpuri se giraftaar ek solver ne madhya pradesh ko rajyapal ramanaresh yadav ke bete kaa naam liya tha jinaki sandigdh halaat main lakhanu main maut ho gai
 With this comes the question that when the NDA government was formed, some UPA governors were also removed for alleged corruption but how did Ramnaresh Yadav survive
 madhya pradesh hoicourt ne rajyapal ke khilaaf exiaar radd kar di he lekin jab aarope lage the tab bhi nahin hataae gaye
 For the past several days, it was being argued that Ujjain's Namrata committed suicide but now facts are coming out that the medical student Namrata Damor was killed
 namrata ke parivaar kaa intervyuu karne ke dauraan patrkaar akshay singh kii maut ho gai thi
 Namrata's role in Vyapam is not clear but his body was found on a railway track in Ujjain
 janvari 2012 kii postmart report kahati he uski maut VIOLENT ASPHYXIA yani dam ghontkar kii gai thi
 The question arises whether the police gave the statement without looking at the post mortem report
 kiske dabaav main aatmahatya qaraar diya gaya
 Namrata's brother says that there was pressure from the administration to compromise
 tippaniyan On Tuesday, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh wrote a letter to the Madhya Pradesh High Court asking the case to be handed over to the CBI but the Jabalpur High Court said that there are several petitions in the Supreme Court in this regard, so the decision is out of jurisdiction
 udhar buudhvaar ko supreme court kii dabl bench ne special bench banane kaa suzav diya he
 Today, there has been another progress in the pen drive case of whistle blower Prashant Pandey
 wheasal blor apni pen driev estf ko de di yah kah kar isamen asli saboot hai
 The STF reported to the SIT that the evidence in the pen drive is fake
 hoicourt ne esaiti kii report par kaha ki pratham drushtya ham sahamat hai
 Prashant Pandey went to Delhi High Court with a pen drive
 vahaan madhya pradesh sarkaar ne kaha ki pen driev farzi he or hamen zarurat nahin he
 The Delhi High Court gave the pen drive to the Jabalpur High Court
 do haftaa pehle jis pen driev ko estf ne khaarij kar diya tha waapas court se kaha ki hamen de di jaae
 The court sought an opinion from Amicus Curiae that has been submitted on Wednesday
 20 july ko jabalpur hai court is par apana faisla de sakati he
 Amicus Curiae reports in a sealed envelope
 khaas to nahin bataaya par unki baton se laga ki ve bina jaanch ke pen driev ko phenkane ke paksh main nahin hai
 So the government's claim on pen drive also seems to prove to be half incomplete
 aisa hi ghotaalaa 2010-11 main chhattisgarh main bhi khul chukaa tha

 Only 25 challans have been produced against them and the police have not been able to arrest one and a half dozen accused students

 Out of these 23 students were also arrested and released on bail and came to college
 kuch abhi bhi jail main hai or kuch faraar

 mainpuri se giraftaar ek solver ne madhya pradesh ko rajyapal ramanaresh yadav ke bete kaa naam liya tha jinaki sandigdh halaat main lakhanu main maut ho gai
 With this comes the question that when the NDA government was formed, some UPA governors were also removed for alleged corruption but how did Ramnaresh Yadav survive

 The question arises whether the police gave the statement without looking at the post mortem report

 Namrata's brother says that there was pressure from the administration to compromise
 tippaniyan On Tuesday, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh wrote a letter to the Madhya Pradesh High Court asking the case to be handed over to the CBI but the Jabalpur High Court said that there are several petitions in the Supreme Court in this regard, so the decision is out of jurisdiction

 agar aapako bahut zyada ghin aati he to ye khabar nishchit taur par aapke liye nahin he
 Because hardly you have seen this more disgusting video, you will see at the end of this news
 aap video dekhakar ji kharaab nahin karnaa chaahate to keval khabar pard sakate hai
 Actually one person was suffering from an ear infection
 uske kaan main koi aam infections nahin tha, balki yah magott yani keedaa infections tha
 Actually he had hundreds of creeping creatures in his ear
 safed rang ke chote-chote keede uske kaan se jhaank rahe the
 The most painful thing for that person was that these insects were alive by eating his flesh and if they were not removed soon, they would reach his mind
 ek baar keede uske dimag main pahunch jate to uski maut bhi ho sakati thi
 Doctor Vikram Yadav, who has treated the person, has uploaded this video on youtube
 unhone bataaya ki darasal jab vah vyakti so rahaa tha to us dauraan gharelu makkhi uske kaan ghus gai thi
 The fly left his larvae in his ear which later became hundreds of insects and began to grow by eating the flesh of his ear
 inamen se har keedaa kareeb 1 centimetre lanbaa tha
 When Doctor Vikram was taking these insects out of his ear with the help of tweezers, the insects could be seen to flicker
 iske baad unhone keedon ko ek plastic taub main rakh diya, jahaan ve rengne lage
 This type of infection is common in tropics and sub-tropics and is more common in children under 10 years of age and sick people
 agle pej par padhein: europe va uttar america main bhi hota he ye infections or dekhen videoeurope or uttar america main bhi is tarah ke infections se peedit log mil jate hai
 With this infection, the smell of the affected person comes out with the sound of buzzing in the ear as well as smelly liquid
 isse us vyakti kii sunne kii kshamta puri tarah se nasht ho sakati he
 Infections of the ear and nose are considered extremely dangerous as there is a risk of the worm reaching the brain
 doctor vikram yadav ke anusaar in keedon ko baahar nikaalane kaa sabase acha tarika yahi he ki kaan main aisi sthiti paidaa kar do ki unhen saans lene ke liye baahar aana pade
 Along with this, Doctor Yadav has also instructed that if a child, old man or any other person is sleeping and sees a fly in the house, then it is better that you cover their mouth with a cloth
 taaki makkhi aakar naak yaa kaan main andey naa de de
 Overall, it can be said that caution is the best solution
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne dilli sthit akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan (ames) jaakar purv pradhanmantri atal bihar vaajapeyi kaa haal janaa
 After inaugurating and laying the state-of-the-art facilities and plans at AIIMS and Safdarjung Hospital, Modi visited the elderly leader Vajpayee
 isse pehle unhone ravivaar yani 24 june ko vaajapeyi kii sehat kaa jayja liya tha
 No current statement has been issued by the hospital about the health status of former PM Vajpayee, but it is being told that his condition is improving while he is still in the intensive care unit of Cardio Thoracic Center Huh

 This time, he has said about the terrorist incident in Mumbai that such small incidents keep happening in big cities
 patil ek samvaadadaata sammelan ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 During this time when he was asked whether the terrorist attack in Mumbai was a failure of the intelligence system, he said, "it is not so

 For the last 18 days, the army has been engaged in action against terrorists in the dense forest of Kupwara in Kashmir but it is not getting success
 kupwada ke manigah ke khatarnaak pahadiyon or jangalon main aatanki chhipe hue hai jis vajah se unhen dhughane main mushkil ho rahi he
 The reason for this operation is prolonged, the army does not want any harm to itself
 vaise is oparation main sena pehle hi 17 november ko apane ek karnal santosh mahadik ko kho chuki he
 Apart from this, seven jawans including a lieutenant colonel have been injured
 paanch dfa aatankiyon ke saath golabari bhi hui lekin har baar aatanki sena ko chakma dekar bhaag nikalne main kaamyaab rahe
 Every three to four days, there is a confrontation between the army and the terrorists but the army is not getting success
 sena ke varisht adhikari bataate hai ki yah ilaaka kaaphi oonchai par or ghaney jangalon se ghira hua he or ham kisi tarah kaa apana nuksaan nahin chaahate hai
 More than five thousand soldiers, para troopers, helicopters and uavs are engaged in this operation
 baavjood do se teen aatanki jo chhipe hue hai unhen sena nahin maar paa rahi he
 However, in this operation, the Army has already lost one of its Colonel Santosh Mahadik on 17 November
 iske alaava ek leftinent karnal sahit saat jawan ghayal ho chuke hai
 There were five rounds of fire with the terrorists but each time the terrorists managed to escape by dodging the army
 har teen se chaar din baad sena or aatankiyon ke bich aamanaa-saamana hota he lekin sena ko safalataa nahin mil paa rahi he
 Senior army officials say that this area is surrounded by high altitude and dense forests and we do not want any kind of loss
 is oparation sena ke paanch hajaar se zyada jawan, para trupers, helicopter , yuavi tak lage hue hai
 Despite two to three terrorists who are hiding, the army is not able to kill them

 chah maah pehle bainkon ke swatchta abhiyaan kii kasam kha rahi sarkaar ne jamaa bakaayaa karj ke keechad ko dhakne ke liye rigerv bank kii swaittata par panje gada die hai
 All the claims and promises of banking reforms are dancing headlong
 2015 main is sarkaar ke vahi mantri, jo aaj niamakon ko samvidhan padhaa rahe hai, kah rahe the ki agar modi sarkaar na ai hoti to desh ko pataa hi nahin chalata ki kis tarah karj par karj die gaye
 The government was keen that it asked the Reserve Bank to change the formula to identify NPA (outstanding debt) so that the truth could be revealed
 rigerv bank ne formula badalakar bakaayaa karj se jujhate bainkon ko ek nai vyavastha ke tahat rakhaa jise prompt karactive acshan (pisie) kehete hai
 Under this, 11 government banks were prohibited from expanding the branch network, limiting the disbursement of loans, distributing dividends
 unhen apane munaafon kaa bada hissaa bakaayaa karj ke badale puunji banane main lagaana pad rahaa he
 Their profits are falling
 rigerv bank ne bainkon se kaha he ki apane maalik yaa sarkaar se puunji lekar aaen nahin to unke doobane kaa khatra he
 Surprisingly, PCA has been in operation for the last one year
 abhi kal tak sarkaar is sakhti par phool kar gubbaaraa ho rahi thi
 He felt that this was necessary to save the banks
 june main, isi pisie ke tahat sarkari bainkon ne apni punaroddhar yojana sarkaar ko saunpi thi lekin ab sarkaar ke adhikari yah kehete sune ja rahe hai ki rigerv bank ne pisie banane main vitt mantralay se raay nahin lee
 It is this government that was pushing the table in Parliament saying that the UPA policy of saving the borrowers of banks is over now
 lekin ab use lagata he ki nijee bijli companiyon ko isse baahar rakhaa jaae
 Banks should give them concession in outstanding loans
 darasal, chunavi jhonk main eemaandaaree ke halafnaamon or sudhaaron ke kaul kii chindiya ud rahi hai
 The Reserve Bank's strictness regarding the outstanding loans has suddenly started troubling the government because it now needs to use populist means to distribute cheap loans from banks
 sarkaar to yah bhi chaahati he ki rigerv bank ko mushkil main fansi gaiyr banking vittiya companiyon ko bhi puunji deni chahie
 But how would any regulator agree that reforms should be changed by looking at elections
 agar chunaav he to bainkon ko bakaayaa karj ke bhavar se nikaalane ke liye sakhti kyon rukani chahie? enpie ke niyam sabake liye ek jaise hone chahie! kaarobaari galatiyon ke liye jamakartaon ke paise se khayraat baantnaa kaise naitik he!darasal, bharat main sirf ek jamaat aisi he jo sab kuch keval chunaav ko dekhakar karti he
 And perhaps a job or business does not start with an expiry date of just five years
 rajnatik dal apane chunavi vaadon se chaahe jo kamedi karaaen, lekin jab ve nitiyon ko sir ke bal khadaa karne lagate hai to swatantra niamakon kaa yah daayitv he ki ve sarkaar ko aainaa dikhaaen
 What the government is threatening the Reserve Bank is understanding that elected representatives in a democracy are supreme because they are sent to protect the autonomy of constitutional institutions, not to intimidate them

 First of all, i express my gratitude to the millions of citizens of the country that before 'mann Ki Baat', when i ask for suggestions, a lot of suggestions come
 narendramodiapp par, Twitter par, Facebook par, dak se, main iske liye sabakaa abhaari hum
 Shobha Jalan to me, he wrote on narendramodiapp that a lot of public is not aware of the achievements of ISRO
 or isaliye unhone kaha he ki main 104 Satellites ke launch or interceptor missile ke bare main kuch jaankaree duun! shobhaa ji, aapkaa bahut-bahut aabhaar ki bharat ke garv kii misaal ko aapane yaad kiya
 Whether dealing with poverty, avoiding diseases, connecting with the world, bringing knowledge, information - technology, science, has made its place
 15 farvari, 2017 bharat ke jivan main gauravpurn diwas he
 Our scientists have raised the head of India proudly in front of the world
 or ham sab jaanate hai ki ISRO ne kuch varshon main kai abhootpurv mishan safaltaapurvak purna kiye hai
 Recently, ISRO set a world record in the field of space, after the success of sending 'mars Mission' to Mars
 ISRO ne mega mishan ke zariye ek saath vibhinn deshon, jisamen america, israel, kazakstan, netherland, switzaraland, you

 And India too, has successfully launched 104 satellites in space
 ek-saath 104 satellites ko antariksh main bhejkar itihaas rachane vaala bharat duniya kaa pehla desh ban gaya
 And it is also a pleasure that this is the 38th consecutive successful launch of PSLV
 yah na keval ISRO ke liye, balki puure bharat ke liye ek aitihaasik uplabdhi he
 This cost effective efficient space program of ISRO has become a wonder for the whole world and the world has appreciated the success of Indian scientists with an open mind
 bhaaiyo-bahano, in 104 Satellite main ek bahut hi mahatvapurn he - Cartosat 2D - ye bharat kaa Satellite he or iske madhyam se khinchi hui tasveeron, sansadhano kii mapping, infrastructure, vikaas kaa akalan, urban development ke planning ke liye uski bahut madad milegi
 Especially my farmer siblings, all the water source in the country, how much it is, how it can be used, what should be kept in mind, our new satellite Cartosat 2D will help a lot on all these topics
 hamaare Satellite ne jate hi kuch tasviren bheji hai
 He has started his work
 hamaare liye ye bhi kushi kii baat he ki is saare abhiyaan kaa netritv, hamaare yuva vaigyanik, hamaari mahila vaigyanik, unhone kiya he
 Such a strong participation of youth and women is a major proud factor in the success of ISRO
 main deshavaasiyon kii taraf se ISRO ke vaigyanikon ko bahut-bahut badhai detaa hum
 They have always maintained their objective of bringing astronauts to serve the nation, for the general public, and they are also creating new records
 hamaare in vaigyanikon ko, unki puri team ko, ham jitani badhaaiyaan den utani kam hai
 Shobha ji has asked one more question and that is in relation to India's security
 bharat ne ek bahut badi siddhi praapt kii he, uske vishay main
 It has not been discussed much yet, but Shobha ji has got attention on this important thing
 bharat ne raksha ke kshetra main bhi Ballistic Interceptor Missile kaa safal pareekshan kiya he
 This missile with interception technology marked success during its trial by stacking the enemy's missile at a height of about 100 km from the ground
 suraksha ke kshetra main ye bahut hi mahatvapurn siddhi he; or aapako jaan karke kushi hogi, duniya ke mushkil se chaar yaa paanch hi desh hai ki jinhen ye maharath hasil he
 Scientists of India showed this by doing this, and its strength is that if a missile comes to attack India, even from 2000 km away, this missile destroys it in space itself
 jab nai technology dekhte hai, koi nai vaigyanik siddhi hoti he, to ham logon ko anand hota he
 And curiosity has played a very important role in the developmental journey of human life, and those who possess special intelligence talent do not let curiosity remain as curiosity; They also raise questions within him; New curiosities are discovered, new curiosities arise and the same curiosity becomes the reason for new discoveries
 ve tab tak chaiyn se baithte nahin, jab tak uskaa uttar na mili
 And if we observe the development journey of human life of thousands of years, then we can say that there is no complete stop for this developmental journey of human life

 New science, new technology is born out of it and every technology, every new science form, gives birth to a new era
 mere pyaare naujavaano, jab ham vigyaan or vaigyanikon ke kathin parishram kii baat karte hai, to kai baar maine ‘man kii baat’ main is baat ko kaha he ki hamaari yuva-peedi kaa vigyaan ke prati aakarshan badhanaa chahie
 The country needs a lot of scientists
 aaj kaa vaigyanik aane vaale yugon main aane vaali pidiyon ke jivan main ek sthaayee badlaav kaa kaaran banataa he
 Mahatma Gandhi used to say - “no science has dropped from the skies in a perfect form
 All sciences develop and are built up through experience
 "pujya Bapu also said -" i have nothing but praise for the zeal, industry and sacrifice that have animated the modern scientists in the pursuit after truth
 ”vigyaan jab jan-saamaanya kii aavashyaktaaon ko dhyaan main rakh karke un siddhanton kaa sahaj upyog kaise ho; uske liye madhyam kya ho; technology koun si ho; kyonki saamaanya maanav ke liye to vahi sabase bada mahatvapurn yogadan mana jaataa he
 Recently, NITI Aayog and Ministry of External Affairs of India had planned a big unique type of competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas
 samaaj upyogi innovation ko invite kiya gaya
 Identifying such innovations, showcasing, giving information to people and how such innovations should work for the general public, how mass production, commercial utilization of it, and when i saw it, i saw how many important works
 Have done
 jaise abhi ek innovation maine dekha, jo hamaare garib machuaare bhaaiyon ke liye banaaya gaya he
 a normal Mobile App has been created, but its strength is such that when the fisherman goes for fishing, where to go; Where is the best fish zone; What is the wind direction; what is speed; What is the height of the waves - that is, all the information available on a mobile app and with this our fishermen brothers can earn their money by reaching where there are more fish in a very short time
 kabhi-kabhi samasya bhi samaadhaan ke liye vigyaan kii mahatta ko pradarshit karti he mumbai ke andar 2005 main bahut barish hui, flood aayaa, samandar main bhi bharti aa gai or bahut pareshaaniyaan huin
 And when any natural crisis comes, the first crisis comes to the poor
 do logon ne bade man se isamen kaam kiya or unhone ek aise makaan kii rachana ko viksit kiya, jo aise sankat se ghar ko bachaata he, ghar main rahane waalon ko bachaata he, jal bharaav se bhi bachaata he, water borne disease se bhi bachaa saktaa he
 Anyway, there were a lot of innovations
 kehane kaa taatpary ye he ki samaaj main, desh main is prakaar kii bhoomika ke log bahut hote hai
 And our society is also becoming technology driven; Systems are becoming technology driven
 ek prakaar se technology hamaare jivan kaa abhinn ang ban rahi he
 There is a big emphasis on 'digi-dhan' recently
 dhire-dhire log nakad se nikal karke digital currency kii taraf aage bad rahe hai
 Digital transaction is also growing very fast in India
 khaas kar ke yuva peedi apane mobile phone se hi digital payment kii aadi banati ja rahi he, ye shubh sanket maanata hoon main
 In our country recently, 'lucky Grahak Yojana', 'digi-dhan Vyapar Yojana' has received huge support
 qareeb-qareeb do maheene ho gayi hai, pratidin 15 hazaar logon ko ek hazaar rupee kaa inaam miltaa he
 And through both these schemes, an initiative to make digital payment a mass movement in India - it has been welcomed throughout the country
 or ye kushi kii baat he ki ab tak ‘diji-dhan yojana’ ke tahat das lakh logon ko to inaam mil chukaa he, pachaas hazaar se zyaada vyapaariyon ko inaam mil chukaa he or qareeb-qareeb dedh sau karod se bhi zyada rakam is inaam main, is mahaan abhiyaan ko aage badhaane vaale logon ko mili haii is yojana ke tahat sau se zyaada graahak ye hai, jinako ek-ek lakh rupee kaa inaam mila he; chaar hazaar se zyaada vyapaaree wo hai, jinako pachaas-pachaas hazaar rupee ke inaam mili handi kisaan hon, vyapaaree hon, chote udhyami hon, peshewar hon, gharelu mahilayen hon, vidhyaarthee hon, har koi isamen bad-chadh karke hissaa le rahaa he; unako laabh bhi mil rahaa haii jab maine uskaa analysis poocha ki bhai, dekhiye sirf noujvaan hi aate hai ki badi aayu ke log bhi aate hai, to mujhe kushi hui ki inaam praapt karne waalon main 15 saal ke yuva bhi hai, to pansth-sattar saal ke buzurg bhi hai
 Mr
 Santosh ji from Mysore has written on narendramodiapp expressing his happiness that he got a reward of one thousand rupees under the 'lucky Grahak Yojana' but the biggest thing that he has written which i think i should share; He said that i got this reward of one thousand rupees and at the same time it came to my attention that a poor old woman's house was set on fire, things were burnt; So i felt that the reward that i have received, perhaps its right belongs to this poor old mother; So i gave thousands of rupees to him
 i got so much satisfaction
 Santosh ji, your name and your work is giving satisfaction to all of us
 You did a very inspiring work
 dilli ke 22 varshiya car chaalak bhai sabir, ab wo apane kaamkaaj main notebandi ke baad digital kaarobaar se jud gaye or sarkaar kii jo ‘lucky graahak yojana’ thi, usamen wo ek lakh rupee kaa inaam mil gaya
 Now today they drive cars, but in a way they have become ambassadors of this scheme

 Pakistan's Interior Affairs Minister Shaharyar Afridi said today that 44 militants including Masood Azhar's brother Mufti Abdul Rauf and Hammad Azhar have been arrested
 haalanki shehryaar ne daawa kiya ki ye giraftaaryaan kisi dabaav main nahin kii gai hai
 In a press conference, Shaharyar claimed that this action of the Government of Pakistan is not under any external pressure
 ye karrwai sabhi pratibandhit sanghathanon ke khilaaf kii gai he
 Even though Pakistan refuses to accept the arrest of Mufti Abdul Rauf and Hammad Azhar, brothers of Jaish leader Masood Azhar, it is well known that after the Pulwama attack, Pakistan is facing all-round pressure to take action on terrorist organizations
 isiilie pakistan ne masood ajahar ke donon bhaaiyon ko giraftaar kiya he
 Shaharyar said at the press conference that the dossier that India has given included the names of these two brothers of Masood
 pakistan ke mantri ne daawa kiya he ki somvaar ko neshnal ection plan ke tahat ek baithak kii gai, jisamen tay kiya gaya ki pratibandhit kiye gaye sabhi sanghathanon ke khilaaf teji se karrwai kii jaae
 After the Pulwama attack, the all-around Pakistan wants to show the world that it has been tight on terrorism, but the reality is different

 Its hallmark was also seen when it claimed that jud has been banned, even though it was not

 From the list that came out, it was revealed that the Pakistani government has not banned this organization, but only talked about monitoring them
 pakistan ke neshnal counter terarysm athurity ke aankadon ke anusaar, PAK sarkaar ne kai aatanki sanghathanon par karrwai kii he
 Some of these have been banned while some are being monitored
 jinpar nigaraanee rakhi ja rahi he usamen hafiz said kaa jamaat-ud-daawa or falaah-e-insaaniyat foundation he
 It is clear that Pakistan which was saying in front of the world that it is taking strict action against the terrorists and wants peace is all a white lie
 haalanki, is list main jin sanghathanon par bain lagane kii baat kahi gai he, usamen kai bade sanghathan shaamil hai
 These include Jaish of Maulana Masood Azhar

 The court had ordered that every entry point be checked and rtos should conduct workshops on it

 Earlier, PETA, an organization working for the interests of animals, had demanded from all the state governments to stop illegal sacrifice of goats on goat
 peta ne kaha tha ki pashuon kaa vadh sirf license vaale boojadkhaane main hi hona chahie
 The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has written a letter to the Chief Secretaries of all states, the Director General of Police, and several other departments including the Livestock Department requesting that all possible measures to prevent illegal trade and killings of animals before Bakrid Steps should be taken
 peta india ne kaha tha ki gosht ke liye pashuon kii hatya or unki qurbaani se sambandhit do maamalon par 17 farvari, 2017 or 10 april 2017 ke aadesh ke dwaara supreme court ne kaha tha ki pashuon kaa vadh keval aadhikarik license vaale boojadkhaane main hi kiya ja saktaa he
 Hence the municipal corporations will have to follow this order

 The movie songs are already there before the film's release
 film main himesh ne soshal media senceshan ranu mandal ko brake diya he
 Ranu Mandal has played three songs in Himesh's film Ki
 ab himesh ne nae compoger or singrs ko khaas salaah di
 Let me tell you that Singer Himesh participated in mindrox's What it takes to be a successful Musician session
 minakshi kandwal ne is seshan ko moderet kiya
 What special advice did Himesh give to new composers and singers? Himesh said - In today's era, getting a break has become easier somewhere
 lekin problem ye he ki aap sasten kaise karenge
 The brake is available but it is difficult to maintain
 pehle aisa nahin tha
 The first break was not easy, but people used to do it slowly
 iske liye mehnat karnaa bahut jaruri he
 1, 2 The two songs become hits but how to keep them ahead
 industry main tike rahane ke liye kya he jaruri?himesh ne kaha- 'mujhe lagata he ki ek compoger ke agar 25 gane sunaane laayak hai to wo dhai hajaar gane banaae
 He should try to make a song of the day, which i still do today
 maine last 4 saal main 700 gane taiyaar kar liye hai
 So it is necessary to keep working hard
 pehle ek singer ke liye ye hota tha ki mujhe koi compoger phone karegaa
 Had to wait for composer
 aaj ke jamaane main compoger ke paas janaa padataa he yaa phir khud compoj karnaa padataa
 He should give that song to himself
 agar himesh reshmia da compoger himesh reshmia da singer ko aashiq banaaya main brake nahin detaa to main wo banataa hi nahin
 So, being multitalented somewhere, you either have to go behind the composition or you will have to make it yourself
 isliye mehnat karo

 RJD supremo Lalu Prasad has fiercely attacked Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Finance Minister Sushil Kumar in the 'creation' scam in Bihar's Bhagalpur district
 ravivaar ko ek press conference kar lalu prasad ne in donon ko ghotaale ke liye sidhe jimmedaar bataaya he
 Lalu raised about a dozen questions at the press conference and tried to explain that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was aware of this scam since 2013 and he did not take any action on it
 yahi nahin ghotaale kii jaanch shuru karne vaale tatkaaleen jiladhikari kaa tabadalaa hi kar diya gaya
 It is worth noting that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has recommended a CBI inquiry in the biggest creation scam of Bhagalpur in Bihar in recent times
 'srijan' ek gaiyr sarkari sanstha he, jo jile main mahilaon ke vikaas ke liye kaary karti thi, asal main is sanstha kaa mukhya dhandha karodon kaa gorakhdhandha tha
 With the connivance of banks, this institution made illegal withdrawals of more than Rs 300 crore from the government deposit account
 is ghotaale ko lekar rajya kii siyasat garma gai he
 Lalu's questions Laloo Prasad Yadav has asked many questions to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Finance Minister Sushil Kumar Modi in the 'creation' scam
 press conference main lalu dwaara puche gaye sawaal is prakaar hai:1) 25 july 2013 ko sanjit kumaar naam ke ek chartered acountint or saamaajik kaaryakarta ne mukhyamantri bihar ko srijan mahila bank chalaane or karodon ke gaban sambandhit jaankaree dete hue ek vistrut patr likhaa tha, lekin mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne us par koi karrwai nahin karke ghotaale karne waalon ko bachaaya hi nahin, apitu unhen sarkari khajaana lutane ke liye protsaahit kiya
 2) On September 9, 2013, the Reserve Bank wrote a letter to the Government of Bihar to investigate the scam and financial irregularities in the 'creation committee'
 reserve bank ne ko-oparative register ko bhi karrwai karne ko kaha tha, lekin mukhyamantri ne us par bhi koi karrwai nahin kii
 The Chief Minister also consistently supported the scamsters, bypassing the Reserve Bank's doubts
 3) 2013 main tatkaleen DM ne 'srijan' maamle main shikaayat milane par jaanch kaa aadesh diya tha, lekin jaanch report aaj tak nahin ai
 Tell Nitish, why was that investigation report suppressed? Who was benefited by pressing that investigation report? 4) Why was the Chief Minister transferred the District Magistrate who ordered the investigation in the 'creation' scam in 2013? 5) Why did the Chief Minister not take action for 10 years in this scam since 2006 The Chief Minister and Finance Minister Sushil Modi are directly guilty of this case
 6) aarthik aparaadh shakha ne srijan ghotaale main lipt bihar sarkaar kii padaadhikari jayshri thakur ke karodon rupye jabt kiye gaye
 Even then, at whose behest did the Economic Offenses Wing not investigate the entire scam? Nitish has been with the Home Department since 2005
 nitish ne aarthik aparaadh shakha kii jaanch ko kyon chupaaya? us par karrwai kyon nahin kii?7)biharsarkaar kii padaadhikari jayshri thakur ke srijan khate se 7 karod 32 lakh rupee jabt kiye gaye
 According to the news of Hindustan newspaper of 14 July 2013, the then Principal Secretary had said that Jayshree is an officer of ADM level, so the Chief Minister has the right to dismiss him from service, but why did the Chief Minister not dismiss him for so many years? 8) Was the Chief Minister's objective to do most of the postings of Jayashree Thakur in Bhagalpur and Banka? It is worth mentioning that the General Administration and Personnel Department has been with the Chief Minister and as per his wish, Jayashree Thakur was given additional charge of Bhagalpur while being the land acquisition officer of Banka? 9) Even in 2010 we raised the AC / DC scam, Despite this, the Nitish government continued such scams
 10) 2010-11 main CAG ne apni report main 11000-12000 hazaar karod ke sarkari khajaane kii aniyamitata kaa zikr kiya tha? uske baavjood bhi koi kaarywai nahin kii gayi?11)cbi jaanchake aadesh par mukhyamantri kise bevakoof bana rahe he? kya vah RBI kaa circular nahin jaanate, jisamen spasht he kii agar 30 karod se zyada kii koi weetiya aniyamitata he to uski jaanch sibiai karegi? yah to 15000 karod kaa mahaghotaalaa he

 The situation is that the mother has to strangle Mamta and send her children to work hundreds of miles away
 enditivi ke kishlay bhattacharya ne jab ilaake kaa daura kiya tab ek 16 varshiya laapata bacchee kii maa ne bataaya ki chah varsh pehle use hyderabad main ek naukari ke vaade par le jaaya gaya tha
 The broker had told the family that some part of the girl's salary would be given to her every month
 lekin ek baar bacchee kya gai aaj tak na to bacchee kii koi khabar he or na hi dalal dwaara kiye gaye vaade ko kabhi puraa kiya gaya
 This mother, living in a small thatch house, says that with the promise of one year she had taken the girl but every year Durga Puja, Kali Puja came but the girl never returned
 is maa ke paas do ladakiyon ke saath chaar bachche hai or inaki masik aay maatr ek hajaar rupee hai

 There is hardly a single village where a forced mother is not waiting for her missing daughter
 tamaam samasyaon se ghire is sandeshkhali gaanv ko 'ailaa' naam ke tufaan ne varsh 2009 main kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaaya tha
 Poverty has spread here for years
 halaat yah he ki maa ko mamata kaa galaa ghont kar apane bacchon ko saikadon mile dur kaam karne ke liye bhejnaa padataa he
 When Kishyalaya Bhattacharya of NDTV visited the area, the mother of a 16-year-old missing girl told that she was taken to Hyderabad six years ago on the promise of a job
 dalal ne parivaar ko bataaya tha ki ladki ke vetan kaa kuch hissaa har maheene unhen diya jayega
 But once the girl is gone, till date neither the child has any news nor the promise made by the broker has ever been fulfilled
 ek chappar ke chote se ghar main rah rahi is maa kaa kahana he ki ek saal ke vaade ke saath bacchee ko lekar gaye the lekin har saal durga puja, kaali puja ai magar bacchee kabhi waapas nahin ai
 This mother has four children with two girls and her monthly income is only one thousand rupees
 isi se is baad kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki jab agali baar dalal aayega tab bhi yah dukhiyaari use manaa nahin kar paaegi
 It is not that anyone in the village will leave and work
 yahaan, maanav taskari karne waalon kaa ek sargana bhi he jise hari ke naam se gaanv vaale jaanate hai
 It acts as a link between the agencies delivering the green girls to the mandis and the servants in the cities

 is baar jaya kaa dah sanskaar ayangakar samudaay ke reeti-rivaaj se kiya gaya
 Jaya's corpse was replaced by a doll as his replica
 acharya ranganath ne rasmen puri karwaain
 Varadarajan, close to Jaya's half-brother Vasudevan, believes Jayalalithaa was buried, not cremated
 isse unhen moksh kii prapti nahin hogi
 They were cremated so that they could attain salvation
 isliye dafnaaya gaya thajayalalita ko marina bich par unke raajnneetik guru mjiaar ke paas hi dafnaaya gaya tha
 The reasoning behind this was his association with the Dravidian movement
 dravid andolan jo hindu dharm ke kisi brahmanvaadi parampara or rasm main yakeen nahin rakhata
 Jaya was the head of a Dravidian party whose foundation was laid to protest against Brahminism
 mjiarako bhi unki maut ke baad dafnaaya gaya tha
 Near his tomb is also the tomb of Annadurai, the great leader of the Dravidian movement and the founder of DMK, Annadurai was the first Dravidian Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu
 unke antim sanskaar kii sabhi rasmen unki kareebi shashikala ne kii thim
 Some people called the reason for his burial as political
 unka kahana he ki jayalalita kii partdiemkeunaki raajnneetik viraasat ko sahejnaa chaahati he, jis tarah se mjiaar kii he
 Jayalalithaa died on 5 December at Apollo Hospital
 rahul gandhi ko congress adhyaksh bane kareeb chaar maheene hone vaale hai
 His first major test as party president is the Karnataka assembly elections where voting is to be held on May 12
 ek taraf rahul kaa dhyaan karnataka main congress ke kile ko bachaane par he to duusari ore wo chaahate hai ki unki adhyakshata main congress kaa nayaa avatar logon ko dekhne ko mili
 Rahul is changing the installments in the 'grand Old Party' rather than a setback
 wo teji se lekin soch samaj kar faisle le rahe hai
 Their attempt is that there is no scope for rebellion anywhere
 sonia gandhi ke raajnneetik salaahkaar rahe ahamed patel se kai maukon par salaah mashvira karke rahul unako bhi saadhe rakhana chaahate hai
 What is the difference? In the work of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi as party presidents? While the Congress President of Sonia Gandhi, this party remained in power at the Center for 10 years, but it is also true that under his chairmanship, the Congress performed the worst in its Lok Sabha electoral history in 2014
 party loksabhaa main 44 siton par hi simat gai
 The Congress lost that election under Sonia's leadership, but for this, everyone's target was Parrahul Gandhi
 sutron ke mutabik, rahul hameshaa yahi chaahate the ki jab bhi wo party kii kaman sanbhaalein to party se jude sabhi faisle lene kaa adhikaar unheen ke haath main rahe
 That is, they do not even want Sonia's intervention in this matter
 rahul jab tak congress upaadhyaksh rahe, party kaa cheharaa to rahe, lekin santhnik faislon se zyaadaatar dur hi rahe
 When Rahul took charge of the Congress in December last year, after that Sonia Gandhi usually stopped meeting party leaders, so that the message should be that everyone is the party's surveyor
 rahul ne party kii kaman haath main aate hi apane hisaab se party main badlaav ke liye faisle lene shuru kar die
 These decisions gave a glimpse of how the road ahead should be prepared by taking lessons from the mistakes made during Sonia Gandhi's party president
 masalan, rahul ne randeep singh surajevaala ko pehle thode vakt ke liye hi media kii jimmedaari di
 When Rahul used Surjewala to meet the standards of eloquence and availability, using modern communication techniques, he did not delay in securing his seat as media head
 rahul gandhi ne soshal media kii ahmiyat samajhate hue pehali baar party main iskaa alag department banaaya
 Also, according to the personality of Shashi Tharoor and Milind Deora, Rahul gave him the responsibility of Professional Congress
 rahul ne shram-majdoor congress kaa bhi gathan kar diya, jiskaa pramukh arvind singh ko banaaya gaya
 Arvind Singh has been fighting for the rights of hawkers for a long time
 party main data kii ahmiyat samajhate hue iske liye bhi ek alag vibhaag kaa gathan hua
 Rahul also formed a separate Fishermen Congress to link fishermen to the party
 rahul gandhi ne adhyakshabanane ke baad siyaasi lihaaj se bhi 12 bade faisle liye jinke party main doorgaami asar ho sakate hai
 1
 ashok gahalot kaa kad badhanarahul ne party sanghathan mahasachiv ke pad par janardan dvivedi kii jagah ashok gahalot ko laakar ye sandesh diya ki saare bujurgon ko kinare nahin kiya ja rahaa he balki anubhav or nae khun kii milijuli team ban rahi he
 Former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had worked hard in the recent assembly elections in Gujarat as party in-charge general secretary, which was also seen in the results there
 aise main gahalot kaa kad badha kar rahul ne party netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ko ye sandesh dene kii koshish kii ki jo behatar kaam dikhayega, use inaam bhi diya jayega
 2
 seepi joshi ko hataa gohil ko bihar prabharee banane ke minessipi joshi ko bihar ke prabharee pad se hataakar rahul ne sandesh dene kii koshish kii ki kharaab parformens par sajaa dene main der nahin kii jaaegi
 Rahul replaced Shakti Singh Gohil, the Rajput leader of Gujarat in charge of Bihar in place of Joshi
 gohil beshakgujarat main vidhansabha chunaavhaar gayi hon, lekin unako tej tarraar netaa mana jaataa he
 Rahul made Gohil in charge of Bihar, clearing the party line that in the event of an alliance with the RJD, it would hold back the upper castes
 3
 RPN Singh was given the command of Jharkhand by the Command of Jharkhand, after Rarahul became the party president
 kaman sanbhaalane ke baad arpyen ne jeemem or jeviem se gathjod kiya or vahaan se congress kaa rajyasabha saansad ban gaya
 RPN has been the secretary in-charge of Jharkhand nearly a decade ago and his tenure was considered better
 4
 In charge of Chhattisgarh, Dalit leader PL Punia in Chhattisgarh assembly elections are to be held in the second half of this year
 pradesh main essi-asti kii acchhee khaasi aabaadi ko dekhte hue rahul ne yahaan ke prabharee ke taur par dalit netaa piel puniya par daanv khelnaa behatar samajha
 5
 youth congress se aae venugopal ke jimme karnatakayouth congress se aae saansad kasee venugopal ko karnataka ke prabharee ke taur par jimmedaari bhi soch samaj kar di he
 The thinking behind this may be that Karnataka is a state close to Kerala, in which case Venugopal will be better able to understand the conditions there
 6
 In charge of Uttarakhand, Anugraha Narayan Singh was given the charge of Anugrah Narayan Singh, who was a MLA from neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh in view of the high number of Rajputs in Uttarakhand
 uttarakhand pehle uttar pradesh kaa hi hissaa rahaa he, isliye yahaan ke masalon ko anugrah narayan singh acchhee tarah samaj sakate hai
 7
 manishankar ayyar kii chuttigujrat chunaav ke vakt bayaanbaji karne walemanishankar ayyarko ek jatke main rahul ne party se suspend kar diya, jabaki wo gandhi parivaar ke khaase kareeb maane jate rahe hai
 8
 bike hariprasad kii jagah jitendra singhbike hariprasad kii mahasachiv pad se chuttee karke rahul ne apane kareebi yuva jitendra singh ko prabhaar diya
 It is believed that after Digvijay, this decision has been made in the future to try to elevate the Rajput leader in the Congress
 saath hi iske jariye sachin payalat ke liye rajasthan main sanghathan kii kaman sanbhaalane ke liye rasta khulaa rakhane kaa bhi sandesh he
 Jitendra Singh and Ashok Gehlot, both political leaders are given the same sense of being given big posts in the central politics of the party
 9
 In the recent Rajya Sabha elections, Rahul made it clear that the leaders of the state from which the Rajya Sabha MP is to be elected should first get priority
 isi ke chalate janardan dvivedi, pramod tiwari, rajeev shukla sareekhe netaa rajyasabha nahin ja sake
 The only exception was Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who received the award for fighting the case for the party from Bengal, also with the help of Mamta Banerjee
 10
 No political advisor of his own, Rahul Gandhi has not yet made anyone his political advisor
 jabaki sonia ne ahamed patel or usase pehle ahamed patel -ambika soni ko rakhaa tha
 According to sources, Rahul does not want any new power center to be built
 11
 One man, one Pardahul Gandhi is trying to follow the principle of one person one post in the party
 rahul is par adhik se adhik chal bhi rahe hai
 While Sonia Gandhi was the party president, there were many leaders like Pranab Mukherjee, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Ajay Maken who were both in the government and the organization
 aaazaad to usee kadi main aaj bhi rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa hai or party ke upi ke prabharee mahasachiv bhi
 That is why it is believed that in Rahul Raj, he will also have to leave a post
 12
 Steps were also taken to add new but talented people from outside the party to Maukarahul Raj
 bolne main maahir or congress vichaardhaara ke kareeb maane jane waalon ko bhi party ke saath jodne ke liye ye kavayad shuru kii gai
 For this, the media department went to state-to-state interviews
 koshish ye he ki congress se baahar ke logon ko bhi rajya, jila str par party pravaktaa banaaya jaye
 Looking at Rahul's tenure as the party president so far, he has taken his decisions, sensing the attitude of political air
 ye saavdhaanee barti gai ki unke faisle kaaryakartaaon ko bhi raas aaen
 But during this period, some decisions were also taken which were beyond the comprehension of party workers and leaders
 jaise ki upi main gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa upachunaav main congress ummidavaar ko utaarna jinaki jamaanat bhi nahin batch saki
 Apart from this, linking Nasimuddin Siddiqui who was expelled from the BSP with the party, contact Congress with Akhilesh Yadav's misery, Shivpal Yadav, despite this, the Samajwadi party-bsp is looking for a grand alliance
 iske saath hi youth congress or party ke chaatr sanghathan enesayuai main jaan nahin phoonk paane ko bhi rahul kii badi asafalataa mana ja rahaa he
 In the party organization, Rahul has been calling for elections in a democratic way, but despite all efforts, Rahul will choose his Congress Working Committee (CWC) like Sonia, that is, without elections
 phir bhi rahul kai baton kaa khyaal rakh rahe hai
 They are taking quick decisions, but they have not been able to decide the face of CM in Madhya Pradesh so far
 congress ke diggaj netaa or madhya pradesh purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh abhi 'dharmik yatra' par paidal bhraman kar rahe hai
 His visit will end on 9 April
 mana ja rahaa he isiilie empi kaa faisla rukaa hua he
 Rahul does not want the veterans to be offended
 haalanki, diggi raja kaa virdohi khemaa rahul par diggi ke khilaaf puraa dabaav banaae he
 Please tell that many times during Sonia, such people were made in charge of the states, who could not even understand the language of that state
 misaal ke taur par sonia ke adhyaksh rahete hue kerala ke pisi chaako ko dilli kaa prabharee banaaya gaya
 The situation was that many times in the Delhi Assembly and Corporation elections, the candidates had to take the English-speaking person along and meet Chacko
 kul milakar kaaphi chijen rahul, sonia ke andaaj se alag kar rahe hai, javabdehi tay kar rahe hai
 But in many places the strategy still looks like Sonia
 jahaan tak badlaav kii baat he to rahul kii safalataa yaa asafalataa is baat par nirbhar karegi ki unki team jameen par kya nattejey detii he or party kaaryakarta kitne josh ke saath active hota he

 After Chidambaram's son Karti Chidambaram was granted bail, Gurumurthy questioned Justice Muralidhar in a tweet

 After this, Justice Muralidhar had made it clear that he did not have any kind of relationship with P
 Chidambaram
 unhone pi chidambaram ke junior ke rup main bhi kabhi kaam nahin kiya he
 a complaint of contempt was given against Gurumurthy
 nyaayamurti muralidhar or nyaayamurti aies mehta kii peeth ne ienex media maamle main sunwaayee karte hue karti chidambaram ko giraftaar se raahat di thi
 After this, the High Court took cognizance in the case itself and issued a notice to Gurumurthy
 is maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan senior edwocket sudhanshu batra ne kaha tha ki gurumurti ko nyaayamurti muralidhar ke khilaaf kiye gaye apane twit ko lekar na hi pachhtaawaa or na hi unhone bina shart maafee nahin maangi he
 At the same time, while advocating Gurumurthy, Senior Advocate Mahesh Jethmalani said that Gurumurthy has already made it clear that he has deleted his tweet

 rakshabandhan ke agle hi din bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke vidhayak vishwaas saarang ne madhya pradesh sarkaar or congress par hamalaa bolaa
 Sarang, MLA from Narela Assembly constituency of Madhya Pradesh capital Bhopal, criticized Chief Minister Kamal Nath on Friday and also strongly criticized the nehru-gandhi family including Rahul Gandhi
 bijepi vidhayak ne kaha ki aisa koi saboot yaa photo nahin he, jisamen rahul gandhi raakhi bandhavate dikh rahe hon
 He said that at least we did not see any such picture
 saarang ne priyanka-rahul kii raakhi baandhne vaali tasviir laane vaale ko inaam dene kaa bhi elaan kiya
 On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, Sarang reacted to Kamal Nath's association of rakhi with women, saying that Congress leaders had nothing to do with Raksha Bandhan
 yah log italy kii reeti maanate hai
 On the day of the disputed statement on Rahul Gandhi, on the day of the rakhi, Sarang, the attacker on Kamal Nath, also took the Gandhi family in wraps for the faint glow of the Chief Minister's residence
 unhone kaha ki italy kii reeti, niti or samskruti apnaane vaale netaa satta main aaenge to aisi hi tasviir dekhne ko milegi
 Sarang said that Rakshabandhan is a festival associated with the culture of Hindus and what has the Chief Minister or Congress leaders to do with it? He said that he would only do what Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi would say
 gauratlab he ki bijepi ke shasankaal main shivaraj singh chouhan ke mukhyamantri rahete mukhyamantri awaas par bada aayojan hota tha
 a large number of women reached the Chief Minister's residence and tied a rakhi
 mukhyamantri kamalnath ne bhi raakhi bandhavai, lekin vaisaa na to aayojan tha or na hi raunak yaa utsaah
 It varies by the Ijepi attacker
 bihar ke do siyaasi diggaj, nitish kumaar or lalu prasad ko ek-duusare kaa saath pasand aane laga he
 The two leaders have been working for several days to gather the Janata Dal family
 iske liye mulaayam singh yadav kii samaajawaadee party or janata dal (secular) jaisi kai partiyon ke ek saath vilay karne kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 It is reported that Lalu Prasad's party RJD and ruling JDU in Bihar will be merged by the end of January, implementing this effort
 isse pehle kerala kii socialist janata (democratic) kaa janata dal main vilay ho gaya he
 The merger of JDU and RJD will start a very important phase for the Janata Dal family to come together and emerge as a united force
 22 disambar ko dilli ke jantar-mantar par janata parivaar ke bikhare sadasyon ne ekikrut rup main narendra modi se chunaav ke dauraan kiye gaye unke vaadon kaa hisaab maanga
 After the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the challenge of SP, RJD, INLD, JD (S) and JDU is to save their stronghold
 haalanki janata parivaar ke sadsy dalon ke judane or bikharane ke itihaas par najar daale, to nae ‘samaajawaadee janata dal’ kaa rasta mushkilon bharaa dikhataa he
 After two meetings in Delhi, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav has been tasked to draft the draft of a new unified party
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kya nayaa dal maujuuda centre sarkaar kii badali hui vikaas kendrit raajnneeti ke saamne chunauti pesh kar paaegaa? nae samaajawaadee janata dal kii chunautiyon bhi kam nahin hai
 Without a lack of trust, the Janata Parivar, which was built on the hand of Congressism, got broken many times
 phir kai dal ubhare or phir toote
 This sequence has happened so many times that even a large part of the people do not know how many times the family members are broken and scattered
 lihaaja mulaayam singh, nitish kumaar or lalu jaise netaaon ke saamne janata dal kaa ekikaran karnaa bada masalaa nahin he, unke liye badi chunauti ekikrut nae dal ke liye janata kaa bharosa jutanaa hoga
 Who will lead the new party, BJP led by Narendra Modi is continuously flaunting its victory in the state elections
 maharashtra or haryana main usne apane dam par sarkaar banaai he
 In Jharkhand too, the BJP government has taken oath and in Jammu and Kashmir, BJP has emerged as the second largest party
 sawaal yah bhi he ki agar nayaa ekikrut samaajawaadee janata dal ubhar kar saamne aata he, to uskaa netritv koun karegaa
 Will Mulayam Singh be its leader? kya baaki netaa mulaayam singh par vishwaas kar paaenge
 Combining all these parties, the number of their members in the Lok Sabha is 15, while their position in Rajya Sabha seems a bit strong
 haalanki siyaasi galiyaaron main mulaayam singh ko sarvaadhik gaiyr bharosemand netaa bataaya jaataa he
 Before the 2014 elections, Mulayam was overturned against the UPA government after forming separate alliances on several issues, but now there is no UPA government at the center and it is unlikely that Mulayam will go with BJP
 in sabake bich mulaayam, nitish yaa kisi or netaa ke netritv main kaam karenge isaki sambhaavna kam he, saath hi upi or bihar ke baahar in netaaon kaa prabhaav bhi
 Lalu Yadav, who was one of the important members of Janata Dal, ruled for 15 years in Bihar, but failed to change the state of his state
 yadav-muslim sameekaran ke dam par lalu ne lambey samay tak raaj kiya, lekin ye formule ab kaam aaenge ye kahana mushkil he
 Mulayam Singh Yadav's sons are running an absolute majority government in UP and earlier Mulayam Singh Yadav has also ruled UP
 lekin aaj bhi upi or bihar main bijli, pani or sadak kii samasyaayein jas kii tas hai
 Although Nitish Kumar did a better job than all this, he could not go beyond a limit
 apane apane rajyon main dalit, alpsankhyak or pichhadon ke dam par raaj karne vaale ye kshetreey netaa umr ke dhalaan par (nitish ko chhodkar) hai
 The best times of his politics have passed and the middle class of the country has moved ahead

 After casting the vote, Kangana Ranaut counted the benefits of voting and also gave a political statement

 " maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke pramukh raaj thakare ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki anderworld don daaud ibrahim bharat aana chahta he
 Thackeray said that the Bharatiya Janata Party wants to take advantage of this in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections by bringing Dawood to India
 guuruuvaar ko raaj thakare fasebuk se jude or fasebuk live ke jariye logon ko sambodhit kiya
 During this, Raj Thackeray said that BJP used Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for the Gujarat elections
 daaud kii vaapasi par raaj ne kaha ki daaud abhi biimaar he, vah bharat aana chahta he or apni aakhri saans yaheen lenaa chahta he
 This is Dawood's wish but the BJP will show it to be his achievement
 thakare ne kaha ki bijepi kahegi ki congress ne itane varshon main daaud ko nahin pakadaa lekin hamaari sarkaar ne pakad liya
 But this is not the case, but he himself wants to come to India
 haal hi giraftaar hua tha daaud kaa bhaiapako bataa den ki haal hi main thane krime branch ne daaud ke bhai ikbaal kaskar ko giraftaar kiya tha
 Iqbal Kaskar is accused of threatening a builder for extortion

 The mastermind of the Mumbai attack Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi challenged the order of the Government of the Pakistani Punjab province to detain himself under an order to maintain public safety in the Lahore High Court

 It is believed that Lahore High Court Chief Justice Maqbool Bajwa will hear the petition of Lakhvi, 44, tomorrow

 166 people were killed in the Mumbai attack

 But in the rest of the 28 states, there is hardly any city or town where mother, sister or daughter is not robbed

 Like Delhi, Badaun will also calm down after a few days, because it keeps happening
 
 
 behayaayi kii oxigen se saansen leti hui police
 a law that struggles to stay alive in some way by keeping the breaths of the air out of the air of ignorance
 satta ke ghamand main sasti harakatein karti sarkaar or satta se dur rahane kii chatapataahat ke bich rape jaise muddon ko bhi vyapaar banane vaale vipakshi netaa
 And amidst all this, the Aabru of India swinging from the mango tree
 kya yah vakt khushi manaane kaa he ki barason se telugana ko lekar chalaa aa rahaa sangharsh safal hua yaa yah shame kaa samay he
 Sadly, instead of stopping shameful crimes like rape, the people in power seek out the exact reasons for the rape, while the opposition makes it an issue and shines its political shop for two-four days
 phir sab gaayab
 All silent
 sab kuch bhula kar sab apane-apane siyasi mehalon main dubak jate hai
 Waiting for the next rape and then getting out of political palaces
 phir chikhen, phir chillaayen or phir dubak jaaen
 This is what has been happening
 yahi to hota aayaa he ab tak or yahi ho rahaa he
 Have we forgotten that date - December 16, Delhi Who has forgotten the anger after December 16, two years ago? How many big things were done then
 kitne bade-bade daawey kiye gaye the
 Dreams of stringent legislation were shown
 desh ke ubaal ke saath-saath tab pehali baar apane netaaon par yakeen karne ko ji chaha tha
 But what happened to these things, promises and dreams? Then the heat of Delhi had brought the entire nation into heat
 yah ek esa andolan tha jisaki aawaaj ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa tha, kyonki ye andolan kisi netaa, sanghathan yaa party kaa nahin balki aam hindustaniyon kaa tha
 Is this our Hindustan? The corpses of two sisters hanging from a mango tree in a village in Badaun, and what happened to them before, are enough to tell how India is after 16 December? This is a picture of independent India
 shaayad kuch-kuch waisi hi jaisi videshi paryatak hindustan aakar hindustan main dhundte hai
 Poverty, Muflissi, hunger, helplessness, dishonesty, nakedness
 inhen chizon ko wo yahaan aakar apane camaron main kaid karte hai or phir puri duniya main bataate hai ki ye hindustan he
 Two years and a half months ago, when Akhilesh Yadav took over the throne of Lucknow, it seemed that along with other things, the condition of crime in UP will also change
 surat badali bhi
 But instead of being good, it worsened
 desh ke is sabase bade rajya ke ek kinare se lekar duusare kinare tak kahin gum aaie jurm kii tasviir ek jaisi hi najar aegi
 Sadly, instead of stopping the crime, only things are heard from Lucknow's carpentry
 jinhen kaayade se kaam karnaa chahie, wo sirf baaten kar rahe hai
 All that the reporter asked was that women are not safe in UP
 mukhyamantri sahab sunne kii bajaae mahila reporter ko hi taana maarthe hue puch baithe- aapako to koi khatra nahin
 Just look at these recent incidents - after raping in UP, a girl was raped with a 10-year-old girl in a rape-rape of a mentally ill girl in a UPUP
 This is the biggest witness of the fate of this unchanging state
 kisi ko rape ke baad tejaab pilaayaa ja rahaa he to kisi kii izzat taar-taar kar use jinda jalaayaa ja rahaa he
 If a ten-year-old girl is being raped somewhere, women of forty years are not safe even in Akhilesh's UP
 kya badaayun se sabak legaa hindustanbadaayun se pehle sabhi ne dilli kaa 16 disambar or us disambar kaa gussa dekha tha
 Two and a half months ago, Akhilesh Sarkar has completed two years in the throne of Lucknow
 pehla vaada yahi kiya tha ki rajya main jurm kii tasviir badal kar rakh denge
 In the first year of his state, there were more than three thousand murder, close to thousand rapes, more than thousand kidnapping and more than four thousand robbery cases
 duusare saal main janvari 2013 se janvari 2014 ke bich rajya main rape, rape kii koshish or mahilaon se jude duusare aparaadh ke 9500 maamle darj hue
 That is, the cases of crime against women has increased by 50 percent over the previous year
 upi main har roj 10 repanational krime ricard baeuro ke taaja aankadon ke mutabik upi main har roj ausatan das maamle rape ke hote hai
 Another shocking truth is that 60 to 65 per cent of the cases of rape in UP usually occur in the morning or in the evening when women go for open defecation
 khule main isile kyonki gaanv main gharon main shauchalay kii suvidha nahin he
 The rape of both sisters in Badaun also took place when both were going for open defecation in the evening
 duniya kii musiibat he rape kii maansiktarep kii maansikta kisi ek pradesh yaa desh nahin balki puri duniya kii sabase puraani musiibat he
 Especially in the way with which our society is raising its men, it is a problem of rapes that from one year old to 90 years old woman is being raped
 jaahir he in sab ke peeche hamaara najariya he
 The vision that sees a paradise in the mother's feet, ties a rakhi to the sister's protection, but kills the daughter
 aurat ko bas or bas istemaal kii cheez samajhataa he
 This approach needs to be changed
 saath hi jarurat he netaaon kii siyasat ko badalane kii
 Otherwise, such cities will not be known in many cities and towns

 At the same time, he said that the talk of 'honeytrap' and bribe about 'cambridge Analytica' is coming out, it seems that the Congress was trying its best to change Indian politics in the 2019 elections
 unhone kaha ki pehle congress ne galati se twit kiya, jab bijepi ne unka raaj kholaa to unhone apstore se apana ap hi delit kar diya
 This day will be remembered in particular

 The story of the film 'fantastic' begins with animation narrating the story of Pankaj Kapoor, or Bipin, in the voice of Naseeruddin Shah, who has adopted a baby girl
 bacchee kaa naam aalia he or ise neend nahin aati
 And after this, Shahid Kapoor has a great entry in the first scene
 baad main ye kahani pahunchati he destination marij kii taraf jahaan pankaj kapur kii duusari beti isha kii shaadi hone vaali he sanjay kapur ke chote bhai se or is shaadi kaa puraa intjaam kiya he jagajinder yani shahid kapur ne
 It seems that Shahid also has a sleep disorder
 film 'shandaar' main destination marij ke naam par kuch achche drishy hai
 Beautiful scenes are shown on screen
 ek romantic kamedi film he jisamen shahid or aalia kii jodi behtareen lagi he or donon ne badi aasaan dikhne vaali behtareen acting kii he
 Pankaj Kapoor's performance is great and Sanjay Kapoor is also good
 nirdeshak vikaas bahal ne diarection main apni chhap kahin-kahin dikhaai he, jaise aalia ke ird-gird titliyon kaa udana, phulon kaa girnaa vagairah-vagairah

 If you want to see a fantastic pair of Shahid and Alia, then you can see once
 agar film nahin bhi dekhenge to kuch miss nahin karenge, kyonki vikaas bahal kii film 'queen' ko maine 4 star die the or ise 2
 Giving 5 stars, you can guess how much difference there is between the two films

 shahid or aalia kii shandaar jodi agar dekhnaa chaahate hai to ek baar aap dekh sakate hai
 If you do not watch the film, you will not miss, because i gave 4 stars to Vikas Bahl's film 'queen' and 2 to it
 5 star de rahaa hum to aap andaaza laga sakate hai ki kitna fark he donon filmon main
 If you want to see a fantastic pair of Shahid and Alia, then you can see once
 agar film nahin bhi dekhenge to kuch miss nahin karenge, kyonki vikaas bahal kii film 'queen' ko maine 4 star die the or ise 2
 Giving 5 stars, you can guess how much difference there is between the two films

 Vishwan Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Pravin Togadia has again spewed poison
 amarnath ke baltaal shivi main hui hinsa ke baad unhone alpsankhyakon ko behad aapattijanak lahaze main dhamkee di he
 On Saturday, he said that Muslims may have forgotten the 2002 Gujarat riots, but they will remember last year's Muzaffarnagar riots

 Togadia blamed the Omar Abdullah government of the state for the violence in the Baltal camp
 do din pehle hi viechpi netaa ashok singhl ne musalamaanon ko paroksh rup se dhamkee di thi
 He said that the minority community will have to learn to respect the feelings of Hindus, otherwise they will not be able to exist for long
 'AAP pravaktaa ko giraftaar kiya, togadiya ko nahin'jediu adhyaksh sharad yadav ne ashok singhl or togadiya ke bayanon kii kadi ninda kii he
 Referring to the arrest of AAP spokesperson Dilip Pandey on the poster controversy, he said, 'this government was talking about development and bringing good days

 The commission report released last week states that the water level in the country's dams, ponds and river basins is falling
 baandhon or talabon ke maamle main yah giravat 10 saal ke ausat se bhi neeche chali gai he
 Water level of dams and reservoirs 63
 59 bisiem (arab ghan meter) ke str par he
 It averaged 69 over the last 10 years
 76 bisiem se bhi neeche chal rahaa he jo ki 39 fisadi he
 In the week before 15 February, it was 41 per cent
 desh ke 91 main se 35 jalaashyon main pani kaa str saamaanya se kam he
 Water in Narmada, Sabarmati, Tapi, Godavari, Krishna river basins has also gone below the average of ten years
 in nadi basin ke ilaakon main pani kii killat bad rahi he
 Rivers originating from the Himalayas are relieved by rain and snowfall in the second week of February
 monsoon kii barish sarkari aankadon main saamaanya rahane ke baavjood yah killat kyon jhelni pad rahi he? mausam ke aankadon kaa vishleshan karne vaali company scymet ke pramukh mausam vigyaani mahesh palavat bataate hai ki june se sitambar ke dauraan 96 se 104 fisadi tak kii barish saamaanya maani jaati he
 It is not a bad thing to have one percent less than normal (95) rain in 2017
 is baar barish sab jagah ek-si nahin hui
 Gujarat received 19 percent more rainfall than normal and Rajasthan received 8 percent more rainfall
 yah aankada to behatar dikhataa he par iskaa koi phayda dharaatal par nahin hua
 There was a flood and the water went into the sea
 iske alaava tamaam ilaakon main monsoon ke dauraan kam barish hui jisase vahaan pani sankat shuru ho gaya he
 Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh received 20 to 30 percent less rainfall than normal
 jharkhand
 Himachal Pradesh, Bihar and Chhattisgarh received nearly 10 percent less water than normal
 monsoon ke alaava sardi main bhi is baar barish kam hi hui he
 In 2018, the first fortnight of February received 58 percent less rainfall than usual, which is a major reason for drought-like conditions
 noida ke rashtriya madhyam avadhi mausam purvanumaan centre ke vaigyanik bhi kah rahe hai ki philhal mausam shushk rahegaa
 Now the temperature will increase gradually
 udhar, palavat bataate hai ki aane vaale dinon main barish kii koi khaas ummid nahin dikhaai detii
 No system of any kind is seen
 agle do-teen maheenon main taapmaana badhegaa jisase pani kaa sankat or prabal hone ke asaar lagate hai
 On the water front, there is no sign of relief before the monsoon
 maharashtra ke rajnatik dal swabhimani paksh ke adhyaksh raju shetty kehete hai, ''vidarbha or marathavada ke kuch hisson main pani kii killat dikh rahi he
 Yes, the situation is not the same as last year as the monsoon rains were fine
 pradesh main bheeshan garmi ke kaaran may ke pehle hakrate se mushkil badhati he
 But the drinking water crisis has started appearing in all the cities and villages of the state
 ’’ bakaul shetty, jaalnaa, osmanabad or bid main aane vaale dinon main halaat or kharaab ho sakate hai
 But the situation in Gujarat is much worse
 yahaan madhya pradesh ne narmada kaa pani dene main adnga lagaana shuru kar diya he kyonki vah pehle apane rajya kii supplai sunishchit karnaa chahta he
 This time the condition of Gujarat is still in a shambles
 vahaan barish kaa 40 fisadi pani samudr main bah jaataa he
 Nitin Thakur, the convenor of Pravah, an NGO active in the water and sanitation sector in the state, says that the main source of water here is the Sardar Sarovar Project
 isse pradesh ke 131 shahar or 53 fisadi gaanvon ko peyajal kii aapurti hoti he lekin madhya pradesh main barish kam hone se narmada main pani bahut kam he
 For this reason, this year Gujarat will get 45 percent of the fixed 90 lakh acre feet of water, i
e
 about 47 lakh acre feet of water
 iske alaava sinchai or udyog ko bhi pani kii supplai honi he
 Obviously, the situation is expected to be very bad here in summer
 madhya pradesh ke shaharon main pani kii killat abhi se shuru ho chuki he
 Laxman Singh Rathore, former director general of the Indian Meteorological Department, says that most of the water in the reservoirs comes during the monsoon
 garmi ke mausam main vashpotsargan kii dar kaaphi bad jaati he or khapat main bhi teji aa jaati he
 Water from reservoirs is increasing irrigation and supply to cities
 isaki dar bhi bad rahi he
 The glaciers of the Himalayas are shrinking and this is also happening due to increasing temperatures
 pichley 18 saal se saal-dar-saal garmi badi he
 This sequence of raising the temperature will continue this year
 rathore kehete hai, ‘‘paramparaagat rup se desh ke kuch bhaagon main pani kii killat har saal bani rahati he
 From the plateau, Karnataka to Marathwada and Telangana, a large area of tamil Nadu, including Chennai, and central Rajasthan create drought-like conditions every year
 ’’2018 main dakshin africa shahar capatoun ke pani sankat kii charchaa duniya main rahi to yahaan karnataka kii rajdhanu bangaluru kaa jal sankat bhi kaaphi surkhiyaan bator gaya
 "every city in our country is Cape Town in terms of water," says Rajendra Singh, who has watched the rivers and reservoirs of the country closely for the past 15 years
 abhi ham shaharon ke liye sau kilometre yaa isse kam-zyada duuri se pani lekar aate hai
 But now with the drying up of the rivers, it has become difficult to bring this far
 capatoun main pani sankat kaa maamla to kisi ne ranneeti ke tahat media main aakhri aadmi tak pahunchaa diya
 "drought in India has increased 10 times since independence due to large dams," says Rajendra Singh
 inaki vajah se canal ke chhoron par pani nahin pahunchataa or pani ko lekar ladaaiyaan shuru hui hai
 Fights like the Cauvery dispute are examples of this
 iske peeche bhale raajnneeti ho sakati he lekin itnaa tay he ki garmi ke aane vaale teen maheene pani kii agnipariksha lenge

 There was a time when Mayawati's birthday meant grandeur, jalsa, rally, cake and even a garland of occasional notes
 lekin ab vivaadon se peechha chhudaane ke liye mayawati apana janmdin saadagi se manaati hai
 Tuesday was his 57th birthday and was celebrated by the BSP as Public Welfare Day
 naa to kek tha, naa dhol nagaade or naa hi kisi tarah kaa tamaasha, dilli ke ek hotel main mayawati ne apana janmdin apni khud kii likhi ek kitaab ke vimochan se kiya
 The people of BSP call this book Balu Book of BSP
 mauka to janmdin kaa tha lekin mayawati ke bayanon se mithaas gaayab thi
 Many times Mayawati, who helped the UPA government on fragile occasions, spewed venom against the government
 mayawati ne kaha ki ye sarkaar naa sirf bhrashtachar main gale tak dubi he balki ek ke baad ek aam logon ko takalif pahunchane vaale faisle leti ja rahi he
 Mayawati also strongly criticized the increase in railway fares, increase in diesel prices and lowering of LPG quota
 lekin jab unase poocha gaya ki agar ye sarkaar itani hi buree he to wo isko samarthan kyon de rahi he, to mayawati ne iskaa sidhaa jawaab nahin diya
 Mayawati also did not spare the opposition BJP and said that its leaders are directionless
 lekin ye kahkar unhone chaunkaa diya ki agar bijepi kii sthiti thik hoti to upie ke kai ghatak dal ab tak endie main aa chuke hote
 Mayawati is now eyeing the Lok Sabha elections and is hoping that such results will come from Uttar Pradesh that she will be able to play a decisive role in the politics of the Center
 ab tak mayawati kai najuk maukon par upie sarkaar kaa jaan bachaa chuki he, lekin unke tevar se saaf he ki aane vaale samay main zaruri nahin ki wo congress kii madad karen
