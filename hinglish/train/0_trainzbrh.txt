 ucchtam nyaayalay ne desh ke vibhinn nyaayaadhikrnon ko samuchit awaas suvidha uplabdh karaane ke prati sarkaar ke udasin ravaiye par somvaar ko talkh lahaze main tippanee karte hue kaha, 'desh kii madad bhagwaan hi kare
 The division bench of Justice RM Lodha and Justice HL Gokhale has expressed their concern over the attitude of the central government and has summoned the reply of the Secretary, Ministry of Urban Development
 nyaayalay jaananaa chahta he ki rajdhani main tip 7 or tip 8 ke kitne bangale khaali hai
 The court adjourned the hearing for the matter to 30 October, making scathing comments on the government's attitude

 ' bihar ke purv mukhyamantri or hindustan avam morcha ke pramukh jeethanram maanjhi aksar apane bayanon ke chalate vivaadon main rahete hai
 This time, he has given one of his suggestions to the voters

 'manjhi has expressed apprehension that poisonous substances may be mixed to make his supporters unconscious
 gauratlab he ki maanjhi do siton gaya ke imamganj or jahanabad jile ke macedompur se chunaav lard rahe hai
 Both these seats are safe

 Manjhi accused his rival candidates of distributing money and liquor to influence voters and asked them to first vote and then drink to avoid the accusation of the opponents on election day

 Once Manjhi had said that there is no harm in drinking a little after returning tired after working all day

 Join eyes with storms, hit the floods, if you love, do this account not once, 100 times
 raahat indori kaa yah sher un tamaam dilaphenk aashiquon ko hausala detaa he, jo aae din mohabbat kii zanjeeron main khud ko kaid pate hai
 For whom love is only once, such things are the biggest lie in the world
 in tamaam logon ko pyaar main aksar ladakiyon se jo bahaane sunne ko milte hai, wo apane aap main dilachasp hote hai
 Here are 10 excuses for girls while rejecting boys
 tum to mere bhai jaise ho-pyaar kaa izhaar karte hi ladakon ke dilon dimag main raksha bandhan kaa ehsaas laane vaala jo bahaanaa sabase pehle aata he, wo he- tum to mere bhai jaise ho
 I've never seen you with this look
 main to tumhen bhai maanati thi or tum
 
 
 poop poop
 yah bahaanaa ladakon main dhikkaar bhav ko anchaaha janm detaa he
 On hearing the excuse, Ashiq takes several days to get out of shock
 2
 There is a lot of skepticism about the way Pyaar Mai Foot is a ghost or not, in the same way some beauties doubt the existence of love
 aise main koi maasoom dil kisi sundari se pyaar karne kii gustaakhee kar baithta he to pehla jawaab aata he
 'love my foot', I'm not sure in love
 haalanki yah bahaanaa aaj ke daur main visiar casette kii tarah ho gaya he, jiskaa istemaal kam hi hota he
 3
 apni shakl dekhi he kya-jab baat dil kii chal rahi ho or shakl bich main aa jaae to samaj lijie ki aapkaa maamla amuk ishk ke mandir main feet nahin hoga
 When expressing love, girls often say angrily that 'have seen their face'
 aise main un ladakon kaa dil sabase zyada tuutata he, jo maheene main kai baar chhip-chhip kar facial karavaate hai
 4
 saare ladke ek jaise hote hai-wo ladkiyaan jinhen pyaar main ladke dhokhaa de dete hai, aisi ladkiyaan ladakon ko lekar ek buree chhavi bana leti hai or har baar kareeb aane vaale ladke ko is puraskaar se navajti hai ki 'saare ladke ek jaise hote hai'
 This excuse, however, cuts off the excuse of 'shakti dekhi hai'
 5
 Believing parents and bournavita, and considering Lord Krishna as a guru, the boys talk about their sliding hearts in front of girls as soon as the answer comes, i cannot betray my parents and family
 is bahaane ko sunate hi ladakon ke man main khyaal aata he ki pyaar maanga he tumhiin se
 
 ghar kii registry ke kaagaj nahin maange hai
 6
 kariyar jaruri he bhai-pyaar karne ke baad kariyar chaupat ho jaataa he
 The girls give knowledge of this unbreakable truth as soon as they express the love of boys
 izhaar karne vaale ladakon ko yah gyaan tab miltaa he, jab wo apni tution fees se kai martabaa greeting card kharidne main kharch kar chuke hote hai
 7
 meri umr hi kya he-pyaar karne ke liye voter card jaruri hota he kya
 Thinking the same question, the boys must have spent hours in the park, when a beautiful girlfriend must have said that my age is still
 tum mujhase umr main bade yaa chote ho
 8
 baba ji kaa thullu-pyaar ko kabool na karne ke bahaanon main is bahaane kaa entry jaldi hi hui he
 But the speed with which it has spread its feet in the garden of unilateral love, it seems that this is the excuse for tomorrow
 9
 i have a boyfriend - i have a boyfriend
 
 Just hearing this, the same question comes on the boys' minds and tongue that what i am missing
 is bahaane ko kuntha paidaa karne kii shrenee main awwal darja praapt he
 Entering the ear of this excuse, the boys look up at the sky and descend into the sea of fantasies and compare themselves to the boy whom girls refer to as an excuse or telling the truth
 10
 i am not that kind of girl - this excuse was born as a strategy to divide women
 ladakon ko kai martabaa 3 jaadui shabd sunne ko mil jate hai
 i am not like the rest of the girls
 aise main pyaar kaa izhaar karne vaale ke man main bhi yah shaq or khoj karne kii ichha paidaa ho jaati he ki main ab us tarah kii ladki kahaan se laaun
 The fun of love is only when there are times of denial, wrangling, sometimes even beating
 to aise main agar koi ladkaa kisi ladki se sachhee mohabbat karata he, to wo in bahaanon se na ghabaraae or pyaar ko sabit karne kii koshish karte rahe
 But be aware of limitations, if you become Shahrukh Khan of the film, then brother will be the same condition of Shahrukh
 
 That karte hue film ke aakhir main hua tha
 If the rest of the love is true, then take this lion of the broken Indori, sitting in mind, 'open flower shops, trade fragrance, leave the voyagers round, swim across rivers'

 They set a unique example of solidarity and courage
 in adivaasiyon ko lamaband kar is muhim se joda police adheekshak ratanlal dangi ne
 Despite being only 62 km away from the divisional headquarters Jagdalpur, this area was far from development due to lack of road
 nai bani sadak ke ird-gird based 24 gaanvon main se ek chandela ke sarpanch subhash naag kehete hai, 'sadak banane se pehle tak logon ko indravati nadi paar karke 10 kimi dur se rashan ladakar laana padataa tha
 'and now after the road is built, the ration is reaching the residents here by trains
 pusapaal ghat ke paroda gaanv se aakhri gaanv kakanar tak 8 kimi lambii sadak 20 saal se prastaavit thi lekin maovadiyon ke khauf ke kaaran koi bhi iskaa theka lene ko taiyaar nahin tha
 The first step in the development of the area was the formation of a police post in Kakanar on 21 April 2011
 sadak to thi nahin, isliye chaowkee ke javaanon ko sajo-saamaan sahit helicopter se yahaan utaara gaya tha
 a serious problem came when it was difficult to take sick soldiers for treatment due to non-availability of helicopters
 tab dangi ne sochaa kyon na graminon ke sahyog se sadak nirmaan ke is mushkil kaam ko anjaam diya jaae
 But the problem was that four people, including the postmaster and secretary of Kakanar, were murdered by the Maoists, who were stunned by the opening of the post
 isliye sadak nirmaan ke liye adivaasiyon ko manaanaa aasaan na tha
 Still Dangi did not give up hope
 aakhirkaar pusapaal ghat ke paanch gramin sadak banane ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 The campaign started on 7 January
 dhire-dhire khauf kii jagah vikaas kii ummid ne le lee or 12 janvari tak is kaam main yogadan dene 50 log pahunch gaye
 Later the number of villagers increased to 500
 inamen bhi mahilaon kii sankhya zyada thi
 Police and STF personnel were tasked to protect the villagers involved in road construction work
 graminon ke aane or jane se pehle police kii ek tukdi bam dyspojal or dog sqoid sahit raste kaa muyna karti thi
 Even during the work, about 100 soldiers maintained a circle around the villagers
 do maah kii kadi mehnat ke baad adivasee apane fauladi hausalon ke boote pahari or jangalon se ghire ilaake main sadak banane main kaamyaab rahe
 In lieu of this, he received 40 lakhs under MNREGA
 kaa bhugtan bhi kiya gaya
 On March 17, on the occasion of the inauguration of the road, tribal development minister of Chhattisgarh Kedar Kashyap said, 'people changed history by changing geography
 'is sadak ke banane se 8 panchayaton ke 24 gaanvon kaa aapas main sidhaa sampark ho gaya he
 This area has also been connected to South Bastar including Abujhmad
 kabhi maraghat kii tarah sunsaan or sannaate se ghira rahane vaala pusapaal ghat ab logon kii chahalkadami badhane se jinda lagane laga he

 350 upanyaas 'phir bhi shesh' sheershak main ek gahare vidhvansak parivesh kaa hona bhi dhvanit he or usase guzarakar jindagi kaa bache rah janaa bhi
 It is the positive skill of the creator that the novel is neither artificial nor unreliable in its undertaking to bring out the evidence of the survival of life
 is tarah raajakmal yah tathy pathak ko saunpte hai ki jindagi na avaruddh hoti he, na use avaruddh hona chahie
 The question of the middle stops, they are the text of life
 
 
 unase kya bachaana
 Yet the remainder arises from the background of a family event
 nayika himani kii badi bahan kaa vivaah ke baad dehanth ho jaataa he or uski badi bahan ke ghar main ek beti rutu or betaa narendra anaath shishuvat rah jate hai
 Himani's brother-in-law Sukhdev is associated with his father and elder brother's business
 vyavsaay main judne kii prakru ti kya he, yah prishth kathakram main himani ke saamne bahut der se khulte hai
 The decisive question is that by becoming the second wife of Himani brother-in-law, should she take care of the sister's children like a mother or, recognizing the tone of her mind, play her independent role in the choice of her path? a defining moment in Himani's life
 yahaan bhavukta se zyada vivek or samvedan drushti kii jarurat he par jeet bhavukta kii hoti he
 Himani's marriage to Sukhdev is the departure point of this novel
 yahaan se saamaajik vimarsh kii anek dharaaen footkar upanyaas ko bahuaiami banaati hai
 The internal politics of Sukhdev's family is a poignant component of the narrative
 sukhdev ke bhai-bhabhi ko himani ke khud maa ban jane kii sthiti apane hiton ke liye anukool nahin lagati
 They keep pseudo-hurdles on the way to make Sukhdev full of Himani's mother
 himani ant tak maa nahin ban paati
 Sukhdev is alcoholic and irresponsible
 use har koi phu salaa saktaa he
 In such a situation, it is natural for his progeny to wander
 himani un bacchon kii ekmaatr patibaddh shubhachintak he, lekin uske saath vimaata kaa visheshan he, jise sukhdev kii bhabhi hawa detii rahati he
 Sukhdev's elder son has become an alcoholic, but somehow a Seth finds work as a driver
 seth ne raajnneeti kii raah pakadi or is tarah upanyaas main ek nai khidki khuli jahaan se desh kii raajnneeti kii sthiti kaa najaara saamne aayaa
 Daughter Ritu turned out to be a model
 is katha vinyas ke bich ek paatr he, vakil aditya
 One is the one who connects to the level of spirit, keeping the human concern with the glorious
 vah himani ke liye vyaavhaarik paramarshdaata kii bhoomika main bhi he
 He is a tenant in Sukhdev's house
 himani kaa aditya se meljol sukhdev ko pasand nahin
 Gradually, Himani realizes that her repeated miscarriage is the result of a conspiracy
 yahaan upanyaas ek avadharana prastut karata he, jo maanviya par saamaajik manyata ke viruddh he
 Himani has the idea that he should fill his vacancy after getting children from her intimate friend's husband
 is par donon sakhiyon kaa samvaad or unki alag-alag manasthitiyaan upanyaas ke aayam main apni paryaapt jagah banaati hai
 Here Rajkamal has taken the bold step to establish a new and human possibility
 upanyaas ke upsanhaar main himani maa bani he, kai-kai shishuon kii
 She is serving in a Balagram, which Aditya has suggested to her
 himani ke is nirnay tak pahunchane ke bich bhi kai mahatvapurn mode hai, jinka spandan paath se guzarate hue hi paaya ja saktaa he
 This epilogue also has a climax
 himani ko apni sauteli beti ritu kii putree ko apane baalagram main sweekaar karnaa padataa he
 Himani is the grandmother of that newborn baby, but she has to keep this fact confidential
 ek baar phir prashn sirf maryaada kaa he
 Once again there is an orphaned baby in Himani's part, whose mother is not in this world
 ek bade canvas par failaa yah upanyaas jahaan apni vividh sthapanaaon ke liye der tak yaad rakhaa jayega vahiin usamen prasangon ke bahulya or ghatnaon kii aakasmikta ke kaaran kuch shithilataa bhi ai he
 The death of Sukhdev, the death of Ritu, the marriage of Aditya, these few situations bring the burden to the story
 par isamen andeh nahin ki inke jariye raajakmal ne kai vaicharik prasthaan bindu samaaj ko die hai
 This element can be called the elixir of creation

 The accused had abducted the girl from the first floor of Haji Kasam Chal of Kazipura on 5 December
 ek varisht police adhikari ne bataaya ki unhone chlorofarm sunghane ke baad behosh hui ladki ko agava kiya
 He was taken to the house of an accused living in the neighborhood
 bacchee kii maa jab use khojane ke liye vahaan pahunchi or darwaja khatkhataya to donon ghabara gaye or mobile phone charger kii taar se galaa dabaakar uski hatya kar di
 He said that the two accused did not allow the girl's mother to enter, saying that one of them was taking a bath
 iske baad main unhone shav ko polithine bag main rakhaa or use chat par le gaye

 phir unhone phiroti ke liye bacchee ko agava karne kisajishrachi thi
 The first day of college is very special for everyone
 wo pehle din uniform se nikalakar cazual kapade pahananaa
 Shifting away from one's home to another city
 yaa phir nae-nae doston se milanaa
 All these memories make the first day of college special for everyone
 lekin duniya main aisi kai jagahe hai jahaan college main admician lenaa bilkul aasaan nahin
 Along with good marks, there are good fees
 isi vajah se kai students ke saath-saath unke parents ke liye college main admician kisi sapane se kam nahin
 Something similar was seen in a Texas woman, who was so happy to hear the news of her daughter's admission in college that she started dancing in the principal's office
 yahaan dekhie ye video
 
 
 In the video you will see that this woman named lajuana mccree gets her daughter's school call, she is a little nervous at first
 lekin jaise hi use phone par pataa chalata he ki uski beti ko college main admician mil gaya he to wo principal ke offis main hi twarking karne lag jaati he
 This video was shared online by Grand Prairie Independent School
 post main likhaa ki aisa baar-baar nahi dekha jaataa ki koi parent principal ke offis main is tarah se khushi se naanch rahaa ho
 The victim of the Bulandshahr gang-rape case, which shook the entire country, finally broke his silence in front of Aaj Tak and vented his anger on the police administration
 peedita kii ankhon main dard saaf jhalak rahaa tha
 The victim said with a full hug that she wanted to punish the guilty with her own hands
 aropiyon ko khud sajaa dena chaahati he peeditapidita ne ajtak se kaha ki unhen tasalli tabhi milegi, jab wo doshiyon kii ankhen phod degi
 The aggrieved woman demanded that first she would punish her guilty, then police and law should be accounted for
 peedit mahila kaa kahana tha ki vah darindo ko apane haathon se maarna chaahati he
 If the police wanted, all the accused arrested women had a lot of anger against the police
 ajtak se baatcheet main apane gusse ko bayaan karte hue peedit mahila ne kaha ki police chaahati to ab tak sabhi aaropee giraftaar ho chuke hote
 But even after so many days, the police have arrested only three
 jabaki police ne 24 ghante ke andar sabhi aropiyon ko giraftaar karne kii baat kahi thi
 Suicidal warning: Angry against the police and expressing her pain, the victim said that if the accused is not arrested in the next 24 hours, she will commit suicide along with her husband and daughter

 At present, the police officers are silent
 ajtak kii team ne maukey kaa daura kiya tha, to ek sone kii chen or ek mahila kaa purse khet main mila tha jabaki police ko wo pehle hi baraamad karnaa chahie tha
 Till date, the evidence on the spot was found that before the team till date, the Kotwali Country Police, CO City, SP City and top officials had visited the spot
 noida estf ne bhi maukey kaa nirikshan kiya tha
 After these, the forensic team also reached the spot, but no one noticed the gold chain and the purse of the woman
 maukey se ek moja bhi baraamad hua tha
 Police is currently investigating the case

 pari ke sabhi das wicket chatkaana kisi karishme se kam nahin
 This has happened only twice in cricket history
 sabase pehle aaj hi ke din (31 july) 1956 main england ke gym lekar ne yah karnama kiya tha
 Not only this, the off-spinner made a remarkable record of taking 19 wickets in a Test, performing amazingly
 gym lekar ne manchester ke old traverd main england-australia siries ke chauthe test main yah itihaas rachaa tha
 In the first innings of that Test, he had already taken 9 wickets for 37 runs
 tab gym lekar puure 10 wicket lene se chook gaye the, kyonki ek wicket toni lock ne le liya tha
 On 31 July, playing on the last day of the Test, Australia started their second innings with a score of 84 / 2 in their second innings
 gym lekar kaa wicket lene kaa silsilaa jari tha
 Stopping them was not a matter of subduing kangaroos, and this is what happened
 len medox kaa aakhri wicket elbeadblyoo hua or iske saath hi 53 ran dekar pari ke sabhi 10 wicket gym lekar ke khate main gaye
 That is, he single-handedly put a total of 20 to 19 wickets in that Test match
 lekar ke baad bharat ke leg spinner anil kumble ne pari main das wicket lene ke record ko doharaaya

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his election speeches has often targeted former Congress governments and their Prime Ministers
 is kadi main unhone is baar 1954 main hue kumbh ke dauraan machi bhagdad ke liye purv pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru ko jimmedaar tehra diya
 Addressing a public meeting in Kaushambi, UP on Wednesday, PM Modi said that thousands of people had died in the stampede due to the chaos when Pandit Nehru came to the Kumbh Mela, but the Congress suppressed the news
 pradhanmantri ke is bayaan ke baad is baat kii charchaa tej ho gai he ki kya vaaki main nehru ke kumbh main jane kii vajah se bhagdad kii ghatana ghati or kya tab ke akhabaaron ne is khabar ko congress ke dabaav main dabaa diya tha
 Newspaper because there was no TV era in India then
 khabaron ke liye janata akhbaar or radio par hi nirbhar thi
 However, some senior journalists believe that Nehru cannot be held responsible for the stampede
 is tark ke peeche unki do pramukh daleel hai
 First, Nehru was not present at the Kumbh on the day of the accident and second, it was difficult to make arrangements like today to control the crowd
 nehru kii moujdugi par sawalvarisht patrkaar piyush babele kehete hai ki kumbh main bhagdad kii ghatana 3 farvari 1954 ko hui thi, jabaki pandit nehru 2 farvari ko kumbh meley main snaan ke liye pahunche the
 After the Kubh Snan, Nehru left the same day under the predetermined schedule, satisfied with the arrangements there
 piyush nehru wangmay khand 25 ke hawaale se bataate hai ki sansad kii kaarywahi kaa byora or nehru kaa sansad main darj bhaashan main is haadase kaa zikr he
 In it, Nehru said that a committee has been constituted to investigate the incident under the leadership of a retired High Court judge
 saath hi vah isamen mritkon ke prati samvednaa vyakt karte hai
 Nehru also encouraged mps to take up the issue and mentioned the incident in a letter to Chief Ministers on 15 March
 prayagraj ke varisht patrkaar naresh mishra ke bibisi main chape bayaan ke mutabik pandit nehru bhagdad se thik ek din pehle aae the, unhone sangam main jaakar taiyaariyon kaa gauge liya or phir waapas dilli chale gaye
 But President Dr
 Rajendra Prasad was in the Sangam area on the day of the accident and in the morning, sitting on the fort of the fort, was watching the procession of the Dnnami ascetics
 tabhi do peshwai juluus vahaan se gujarey or is bheed ne bhagdad kii shakl le lee
 Naresh Mishra, who sees the incident with his own eyes, tells the BBC that this 45-minute stampede was under control, but by then around 700–800 people had been killed
 ye prashasan kaa aankada tha lekin mishra kehete hai ki jo dekha tha or uske baad jo suna tha us lihaaj se mritkon kii sankhya or zyada rahi hogi
 He said that the discussion of this incident remained for months and all the leading newspapers published this Kumbh incident for several days
 kya hua tha us din?angreji akhbaar di statsman main chape photo patrkaar enen mukherjee ke vivaran ke mutabik is bhadadad main kam se kam hajaar logon kii maut hui thi or do hajaar ke kareeb ghayal hue the
 Mukherjee says that on February 3, 1954, a large number of people came to the Sangam for a holy bath on the day of Mauni Amavasya
 mukherjee ke mutabik vah akele aise patrkaar the jinhone bhagdad kii tasviren camere main kaid kii thim
 According to him, there were corpses all around and people were pleading for help
 haadase ke do din pehle hi haija vaxineshan ko band kar diya gaya tha, isi vajah se is din badi sankhya main log snaan ke liye sangam kshetra main pahunch hue the
 The then Prime Minister Nehru and President Rajendra Prasad were also to come for bath on this day
 is ke maddenjar suraksha ke pukhta intjaam kiye gaye the
 The car of the two leaders enters the Sangam area around 10 am and then leaves for the Fort Ghat
 bheed ko kaabo karne ke liye barier lagaae gaye the, tabhi duusari ore saadhuon kii peshwai kaa kafila vahaan se gujarata he or rassiyon ko todta hua aage bad chalata he
 According to Mukherjee, whoever comes in the grip of this crowd gets crushed
 jo jameen par gir gaye vah uth nahin paae or sirf madad kii guhaar hi laga sake
 The dead included children aged 3-4 years, elderly women and men
 mukherjee bataate hai ki hajaar logon kii maut ke baad bhi sarkari adhikariyon ke kaanon par jun tak nahin rengi or vah sarkari awaas main chaay-coffee main mashgool rahe
 According to Mukherjee, the government had completely denied the death of a thousand people
 unka maananaa tha ki is ghatana main sirf kuch bhikshuon kii maut hui he
 In contrast, gold and silver jewelery was also found among the dead, which must have belonged to a woman from a rich family
 mukherjee ke mutabik agle din shavon kaa sanskaar kar diya gaya or kisi ko bhi photo lene kii ijaajat nahin thi
 However, he took out some pictures of the incident, about which the then Chief Minister GB Pant was very angry with him
 kya tha PM modi kaa bayaanpradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaushambi kii raily main daawa kiya ki jab pandit jawahar laal nehru pradhanmantri the to vah ek baar kumbh meley main gayi the
 Then there was the Congress government from Panchayat to Parliament
 tab avyavashtha ke kaaran kumbh main bhagdad much gai thi, hajaaron log maare gaye the, lekin pandit nehru par koi daag na lag jaae, uske liye ye khabar dabaa di gai
 The media of that time also did not dare to show those news
 na main badla na amit shah
 With this answer of Amit Shah you can understand his style of politics
 shaayad praayshchit kii koi jagah nahin
 But i saw Amit Shah addressing 100-50 workers in the Delhi Assembly elections
 mujhe laga tha ki rashtriya adhyaksh itani kam bheed dekhakar laut jaaenge magar amit shah ne dakshin dilli ke ilaake kaa apana kaarykram puraa kiya tha
 Amit Shah is the President of Somnath Temple Trust
 gujarat cricket association ke bhi adhyaksh rah chuke hai
 The journey of a politician is interesting
 vah kab kitaab ban jaae or kab kitaab kaa footnots koi nahin jaanata
 The leader who stays in the footnotes also becomes the book

 a new BJP office was formed in dozens of districts
 amit shah ne inaki yojana banaai or apana kaarykaal khatm hone se pehle desh ke kai zilon main bijepi kaa nayaa daftar ban kar taiyaar ho gaya
 We have heard about the leaders of the other party that they ran into another party with the money of the party, but under the direction of Amit Shah, many new offices of BJP were formed
 dilli kaa mukhyalay bhavy to he hi
 a new political system should have been foreseen from these offices as well
 amit shah ne kaaryakartaaon se kaha ki apane pradarshnon, gatividhiyon kaa puraa record rakhen
 So that people of the coming generations can see it
 research kar saken kyonki zubaani itihaas par koi yakeen nahin rakhata
 It was a surprise to read this line in Sheila Bhatt's article
 itihaas ke mul vishyon ko zubaani taur par badal dene vaale amit shah apni party ke itihaas main tathyon or sorce ko kitni gambhirtha se lete hai

" ’’ ve duusari vajahon se bhi andhra pradesh ke vibhaajan ke khilaaf hai
 He says that "communal riots have been a feature of the Telangana region, which lasted from the late 1960s to the mid-1990s, while coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema have been shielding them altogether

 bijepi ke netaa susheel modi ne bayaan jari kar kaha ki bihar ke kai jile aajkal sampradayik tanaav kii sthiti se guzar rahe hai
 BJP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar Sushil Kumar Modi says that there was no such situation when NDA government was in Bihar
 susheel modi ne aarope lagaaya ki prashasan kii vifaltaa ke kaaran madhepura ke biharigangaj evam bhojpur ke pero ke alaava motihaari, sitamarhi, gopalganj, aurangabad, gaya, darbhanga va mujffarpur ke sahibganj sahit soobe ke ek darjan se adhik sthanon par durga pratimaa visarjan va muharram ke pehlaam ke dauraan tanaav kii sthiti utpann hui
 Unilateral action provoked outrage among the people and the administration completely failed to control the situation in time
 susheel modi ne sawaal uthaate hue kaha- mukhyamantri bataaen ki endie ke shashan kaal main puure pradesh main jo sadbhaav or sauhardra kaa maahaul kaayam hua tha, vah is saal anek sthanon par taar-taar kyon ho gaya? bhojpur ke pero main kai dinon se tanaav kii sthiti rahi, magar prashasan samay par koi karrwai nahin kar paaya

 durga puja ke dauraan utpaat karne vaale asaamaajik tatwon ko giraftaar kar chhod dene ke kaaran hi aam logon kaa aakrosh bhadkaa he
 Similarly, the role of the administrative officers in Madhepura's Bihariganj was doubtful
 tanaav rokane main vifal rahe madhepura ko dm or espi ko sarkaar avilamb hathaayen or vahaan ke esadipio rahamat ali ko nilambit karen
 The situation became tense due to the administration's indifference or unilateral action towards anti-social elements in many places of the state
 updravi tatwon ke khilaaf samay par karrwai karne main sarkaar or prashasan ke vifal rahane ke kaaran rajya ke anek hisson main hinsa kii sthiti paidaa hui

 Poet Munavvar Rana, who recently returned the Sahitya Akademi Award, has said that his statement raising Prime Minister Narendra Modi's shoes has been misinterpreted
 'aaj tak' se exclusive baatcheet main unhone kaha ki yah baat adab or sanskaron ke lihaaj se kahi gai thi or 'juuti uthaanaa' ek muhaavara he or iskaa matlab sirf sammaan dene se he
 Its mean should not be removed
 pesh he munwwar rana se phone par hui mukhtsar baatcheet ke ansh:aapke 'juuti vaale' bayaan par bavaal machaa hua he
 People are saying that your stand is changing? Munawvar: See what is being said in shayari with no tawseel and because of this people often misunderstand
 hamaari baat ko galat samajha gaya he
 What we said hamane kaha ki narendra modi hamase umr main bade hai, bade bhai hai
 The wish was that if Narendra Modi would ensure the interests of the minorities in the country, he would take action against the killers of Ikhlaq, Kalburgi, Pansare and all the people who have been murdered, then i will take their shoes too
 meraa unase koi jaati bair thode naa he
 'raising shoes' is used as an idiom in us
 iskaa matlab sammaan se he
 Will you go if you get a call from the PMO or not? Munawwar: Will go
 par aap aword lautaane vaale baaki sahityakaron ko bhi bulaaie, tabhi thik se baat hogi
 Our caste is not a matter, it is a matter of the whole society, the whole country
 hamane ye kaha tha ki agar koi sahityakar hamaare saath nahin jaataa, us cese main ham akele hi jaaenge or akele hi yah ladaai ladenge
 By returning your award, a large section came against you, but a large section openly came in your favor
 lekin uske baad juuti vaali baat se wo paksh bhi naaraaz ho gaya?munwwar:dil aisa ki sidhe kiye juute bhi bado ke jid aisi ki khud taj uthaakar nahin pahana
 This is my lion, what do you mean by that? 'juuti uthaane' kaa matlab sirf or sirf unka (modi kaa) bade ke taur par ehteram karne se he
 This was not a political thing
 ham siyaasi aadmi hai hi nahin
 Do not relate everything to the politics of our parties
 siyaasi guftgu kerani hamako kabhi nahin ai
 We have been studying Mushaira for 35-40 years
 ham har jagah kehete hai ki hamane apane bujurgon kii juutiyaan sidhi kii hai or unki jootiyon kii mahak aaj talak hamaare haathon se aati he
 That's why our writing probably gets so much love

 jahaan tak sahvaag kaa sawaal he to yah tay he ki vankhede stadium main vah apana 100waan test match khelenge
 It will be a historic moment for him as it is the home ground of Sachin Tendulkar who holds the record for the most 191 Test matches, Indian cricketers who have played more than 100 Test matches so far, apart from Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid (164), VVS Laxman (134), Anil Kumble (132), Kapil Dev (131), Sunil Gavaskar (125), Dilip Vengsarkar (116) and Sourav Ganguly (113)

 On the issue of Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwatnesabarimala in the program being organized in the headquarters of the Sangh, Nagpur, the opinion of the religious leaders should be taken in any matter related to religion
 unhone ishaaron-ishaaron main kaha ki aasthaa ke maamle main supreme court dakhal na de
 Mahato Mohan Bhagwat, who did not believe in the movement of women, said that Sabarimala's decision was aimed at gender equality but what happened
 itane varshon se parampara chal rahi he vah tut gai, jinhone yachika daali wo kabhi mandir nahin gaye, jo mahilaayein court ke faisle se asahmat hokar andolan kar rahi hai wo aasthaa ko maanati hai
 The issue of religion should talk to the religious leaders, they understand the matter of change
 court ke faisle par asantoshsang pramukh ne kaha ki ye parampara he, uske peeche kai kaaran hote hai
 There has been dissatisfaction with the court's decision
 mahilaayein hi is parampara ko maanati hai, lekin unki baat nahin suni gai
 As a result, women are also protesting

 aresas mahasachiv suresh bhaiyaji joshi ne ek bayaan main kaha ki sabarimala devsthanam ke sambandh main haalia faisle par puure desh se pratikriyaayein aayi hai
 The Sangh had said that we respect the traditions being followed by devotees in various temples in India and we also have to respect the Honorable Supreme Court
 sangh ne jor diya tha ki yah ek sthaneey mandir parampara or vishwaas kaa mudda he jisase mahilaon sahit lakhon bhakton kii bhavanaaen judi hui hai

 uttar pradesh main pichley do varshon main jab bhi raajnneeti main kisi aparaadh ne apana khaufnak cheharaa dikhaaya, tab-tab sajeeshkarta ke rup main ek naam aksar saamne aayaa
 This was the name of the Chief Medical Officer (CMO)
 mayawati shashan ke antim varshon main do siemo or ek dipti siemo kii hatya hui to sapa kii vartmaan sarkaar main bhi siemo sambandhit bhrashtachar kaa yah silsilaa thama nahin he
 CMO of Gonda district Dr
 es
 P
 singh ke ghar 8 aktubar kii der raat sthaneey vidhayak or rajasav rajya mantri vinod kumaar singh urf pandit singh ne dhaava bolaa or siemo agava kar liye gaye
 Later Dr
 singh kisi tarah jaan bachaakar lakhanu pahunche
 On the one hand, the CMO was accused of not accepting the recommendation of the Minister in the recruitment of AYUSH (ayurveda, Homeopath, Unani, Siddha and Yoga) doctors, on the other hand, the Minister describes all the allegations against him as politically motivated
 maamla garmaya to pandit singh ko apane pad se haath dhonaa padaa or siemo sahab bhi apni kursi ganvaa baithe
 The matter did not stop here
 pandit singh ke samarthakon ne siemo karyaalay ke baahar jamkar pradarshan kiya
 He alleged that cmos are corruption in the selection of doctors and employees
 puraa prakaran ab jaanch ke daayre main he, lekin ek baat saaf ho gai he ki aakhir siemo kii kursi main aisa kya he ki vah sabake nishane par he? kyon isi kursi kii vajah se dedh varsh main teen mantriyon ko apane pad se haath dhonaa padaa
 Actually the CMO chair is considered very creamy
 sarkari doctoron main is kursi ko hathiyaane ke liye varsh 2005 se hode shuru hui, jab prantiy chikitsa seva (piemes) kaa cader rivyuu (sanvarg punargathan) lagu hua
 Earlier, there were 371 posts of CMO i
e
 Joint Director level in the state
 inhen main se kareeb 70 jilon main siemo tainaat hote the
 But in the year 2005, the number of Joint Director level posts increased to 2,475, out of which 1,000 doctors of the general category were considered eligible to become cmos
 chunki siemo ke 70 padon ke liye daavedaaron kii sankhya adhik ho gai so ise paane ke liye nae tikadam lagane bhi shuru ho gaye
 Most doctors contacted the drug mafia
 in mafia ne apane logon ko siemo banavaane ke liye sarkaar main mantriyon or adhikariyon ko paise die or badale main siemo se dawa supplai kaa theka or anya sahuliyatein hasil kin
 In the year 2007, funds for several schemes of National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) came to Efrat in the district
 masalan, pehle swasthya sevaaon ke liye rajdhani lakhanu ke siemo karyaalay kaa salanaa bajet jahaan keval 5 karod ru
 70 crores from the year 2007 onwards
 ho gaya
 The budget of a small city like Gonda also increased manifold
 enarechaem ke pehle yahaan ke siemo ko swasthya sevaaon main kharch karne ke liye sava karod ru
 The annual budget was found which later increased to Rs 40 crore
 ho gaya
 Apparently, suddenly, after reaching the health department of the district with such a huge amount, everyone had a vivid vision on it
 is paise ko hathiyaane ke liye dawa mafia ne apana dhandha badal diya
 Now they also started contracting construction works
 enarechaem ghotaale main aise hi dawa vyapaaree girish malik ko nirmaan kaary main dhaandhlee baratane ke aarope main giraftaar kiya ja chukaa he
 The construction of 513 health substations in the last five years was shown on paper only and the alliances of cmo-contractors allocated Rs 70 crore for it
 kii bandarbaant kii
 To curb this corruption, the government wrested the right to use NRHM funds directly from the previous CMO and formed a committee, headed by DM and Secretary CMO
 sevanivrutt siemo dow
 R
 en
 Shukla says, "in the last five years, the nexus between CMO and drug mafia looted nrhm's money
 ek saadhaaran doctor siemo banane ke baad karodpati ban gaya
 Big chambers were built and seeing their colleagues progressing so quickly, other doctors too became eager to become cmos
 ''yahi vajah he ki beete chaar varsh ke dauraan pradesh main tainaat rahe 50 se zyada siemo bhrashtachar ke maamle main sibiai ke radar par hai
 These officials are accused of monetizing NRHM funds
 sarkaar main baithe niti niyantaaon ko bhi yah 'ganit' samaj main aa gaya
 He changed the rules of PMS again and last year every doctor of joint director level was declared eligible to become CMO
 phir kya tha, jis doctor kii pahunch thi, vahiin siemo ban baitha
 When Ajay Agarwal, brother of Sanjay Agarwal, Principal Secretary, Health Department, became the CMO of Ghaziabad, the close of a leader or officer took over the chair of CMO in all major districts of the state
 is vakt siemo kaa zyaadaatar samay enarechaem se milane vaale dhan kaa upyog karne ke liye yojanaayen banane or doctoron va paramedical staff kii bhartee main hi biit rahaa he
 Presently, the recruitment process of 15,000 doctors and paramedical staff under NRHM is going on in the entire state
 unka chayan sanvida par keval intervyuu ke jariye kiya janaa he
 CMO of Kushinagar Dr
 sanjeev gupta ne tabadalon va niyukti ko lekar mantri va anya logon par dabaav daalane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 At the same time, the CMO of a district adjacent to Lucknow says that local leaders and mlas are pressurizing the CMO to make a proposal to open a health center in their area and it is not being seen whether the health sub-center is needed or not
 yahi haal enarechaem kii bhartiyon ko lekar bhi he
 The CMO of a district of Purvanchal says that due to the large number of deployments in NRHM, cmos have once again come under target
 haalanki chayan prakriya ke adhyaksh dm hai, lekin netaa siemo se sifarish kar rahe hai
 Provincial Medical Services Association General Secretary, Dr
 nirupama singh bataati hai ki jile main siemo sabase kamjor adhikari hota he or isi vajah se sabhi log ise nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 She says, "the government should protect all cmos
" ''pichley paanch varshon main swasthya vibhaag main jis tarah paise kii bandarbaant hui he, usne zyaadaatar siemo ko bhrashtachar ke daldal main dubo diya he
 But the way the CMO was attacked in Gonda has put the SP government's claim of being different from the BSP government
 yah buniyadi taur par swasthya vibhaag kii beemaari ko darshata he
 It is clear that the government will have to rise above fraternity, regionalism and show confidence in good officials and the ears of autocratic ministers will have to be pulled
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ravivaar shaam bijepi mukhyalay pahunche
 This was his first visit to the BJP headquarters after assuming the office of Prime Minister
 yahaan unhone in loksabhaa chunaavon ko desh hi nahin vishwa ke liye 21veen sadi kaa nirnaayak bindu bataate hue aaj kaha ki agar bijepi sarkaar ne aam nagarikon ke haq main puri nishtha ke saath kaam kiya to desh kii janata usase kabhi naata nahin todegi
 He said that the people of the country had turned away from the Congress in 1967 itself, but disappointed with the experiments that followed, she turned to the same (with the Congress)
 pradhanmantri banane ke baad pehali baar yahaan bijepi mukhyalay aae modi ne kaha, 'ye hamaara daayitv banataa he ki janata hamase 10 kadam aage he to ham yah dekhen ki usase kaise kadam se kadam mila kar chalem, kaise apana aacharan karen
 This will increase his confidence in us
 modi ne kaha, 'isse pehle ke chunaavon main raajnneeti se zyada jaateey samikrnon kii charchaa hoti thi lekin yah pehla chunaav he jisamen saare jaateey samikarnon, bhugolic samikarnon or anya paramparaagat samikarnon se upar uth kar janata ne janadesh diya
 He questioned what was the inspiration and expectation that was connecting the people from Kashmir to Kanyakumari with this point
 jawaab khud hi dete hue unhone kaha, yah 'janata kii aashaa' kaa chunaav tha
 Modi said, 'it is therefore the responsibility of the government and the BJP to live up to the aspirations of the people
 mehnat karne main koi kami nahin choden
 If our decisions are in the direction of doing good for the common citizens, and if they are with full devotion, then the public will never break with us, i assure you
 ' Host India batted fast and sensible Dinesh Karthik (31 not out, 34 balls, 3 fours, 1 six) and Hardik Pandya (unbeaten 21 runs, 9 balls, 3 fours), playing his first international T20 match
 Thanks to the 5-wicket defeat to the Windies at Eden Gordon to take a 1-0 lead in the series

 ’ Mother Vaishno who follow Sanatana Dharma do not get tired of singing the glory of Goddess
 hamaare dharamshastron main kalyug main logon ke ksht harne ke liye devi-devataaon ke namajap ke saath-saath kathaayen bhi behad upyogi bataai gai hai
 There are some differences in the stories also due to the difference in location and time
 bas man main sachhee shraddha honi chahie, prabhu krupa avashya karte hai
 Although there are many stories related to Tomata Vaishno Devi, but the story which is most prevalent is being given further
 
 
 vaishno devi ne apane ek param bhakt pandit shridhar kii bhakthi se prasann hokar uski laaj bachaai
 Mother made the whole world aware of her glory
 tab se aaj tak log is tirthasthal kii yatra karte hai or mata kii krupa pate hai
 Sanshar, the supreme devotee of Maa Vaishnavi, lived in Hansali village, some distance from Katra
 ve ni:santan hone se du:khee rahete the
 One day he called for virgin girls to worship Navratri
 maa vaishno kanya vesh main unheen ke bich aa baithi
 After the worship, all the girls left, but mother Vaishno Devi stayed there and said to Sridhar, 'come invite everyone to your home bhandare
 ’ shridhar ne us divya kanya kii baat maan lee or aas-paas ke gaanvon main bhandare kaa sandesh pahunchaa diya
 While returning from there, along with Guru Gorakhnath and his disciple Baba Bhairavnath ji, he also invited his other disciples for food
 bhojan kaa nimantran paakar sabhi gaanvvasi achambhit the ki vah koun si kanya he, jo itane saare logon ko bhojan karwaanaa chaahati he? iske baad shridhar ke ghar main anek gaanvvasi aakar bhojan ke liye jamaa hue
 Then mother Vaishno Devi in the form of a girl started serving food to everyone with a strange character
 bhojan paroste hue jab vah kanya bhairavnath ke paas gai, tab usne kaha ki main to kheer- puri kii jagah maance khaauungaa or madirapan karuunga
 Then the mother of the daughter of the girl explained to him that it is the food of the Brahmin, it does not eat meat
 kintu bhairavnath ne jaan-boojhkar apni baat par ada rahaa
 When Bhairavnath wanted to capture the girl, the mother knew his treachery
 maa vaayu rup main badalakar trikuta parvat kii ore ud chalin
 Bhairavnath also followed him
 mana jaataa he ki maa kii raksha ke liye pavanputra hanuman bhi the
 When Hanuman ji felt thirsty, at his insistence, the mother pulled an arrow from the bow with a bow and washed her hair in that water
 aaj yah pavitra jaldhara banganga ke naam se jaani jaati he
 By drinking or bathing its holy water, all the tiredness and suffering of the devotees is removed
 is dauraan mata ne ek gupha main pravesh kar nau maah tak tapasya kii
 Bhairavnath also followed him there
 tab ek sadhu ne bhairavnath se kaha ki tu jise ek kanya samaj rahaa he, vah adishkti jagadamba he, isliye us mahashakti kaa peechha chhod de
 Bhairavnath did not listen to the monk
 tab mata gupha kii duusari ore se maarg banaakar baahar nikal gayi
 This cave is still famous as Ardhkumari or Adikumari or Garbhajoon
 ardhkumari ke pehle mata kii charan paduka bhi he
 This is the place where Mata turned around and saw Bhairavnath
 gupha se baahar nikal kar kanya ne devi kaa rup dhaaran kiya
 Mata warns Bhairavnath and asks him to return
 phir bhi vah nahin mana
 Mata went inside the cave
 tab mata kii raksha ke liye hanumanji gupha ke baahar the or unhone bhairavnath se yuddh kiya
 Bhairav still did not give up
 jab vir langur nidhaal hone laga, tab mata vaishnavi ne mahakali kaa rup lekar bhairavnath kaa sanhaar kar diya
 The head of Bhairavnath was beheaded and fell into the Bhairav valley of Trikuta mountain, 8 km from the building
 us sthaan ko bhemronath ke mandir ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The place where the mother Vaishno Devi killed the stubborn Bhairavnath is famous as the holy cave or building
 isi sthaan par maa mahakali (daaen), maa mahasaraswati (madhya) or maa mahalakshmi (baayen) pindi ke rup main gupha main virajman hai
 The combined form of these three is called the form of Mother Vaishno Devi
 kaha jaataa he ki apane vadh ke baad bhairavnath ko apni bhul kaa pashchaatap hua or usne maa se kshamaadaan kii bheekh maangi
 Mata Vaishno Devi knew that Bhairava's main intention behind attacking her was to attain salvation
 unhone na keval bhairav ko punarjanm ke chakra se mukti pradaan kii, balki use vardaan dete hue kaha ki mere darshan tab tak puure nahin maane jaaenge, jab tak koi bhakt, mere baad tumhaare darshan nahin karegaa
 According to the same belief, even today, after seeing the mother goddess Vaishno Devi, the devotees go to see Bhairavnath after climbing about three-three kilometers
 is bich vaishno devi ne teen pind (sir) sahit ek chattan kaa aakaar grahan kiya or sadaa ke liye dhyanamgn ho gayi
 Meanwhile, Pandit Sridhar became impatient
 ve trikuta parvat kii ore usee raste aage bade, jo unhone sapane main dekha tha, antat ve gupha ke dwaar par pahunche
 He made the ritual of worshiping objects in many ways his routine
 devi unki puja se prasann huin
 She appeared to him and blessed him
 tab se shridhar or unke vanshaj devi maa vaishno devi kii puja karte aa rahe hai
 Even today, there is a flow of devotees in the court of Vaishno Devi for twelve months
 sachche man se yaad karne par mata sabakaa bedaa paar lagaati hai

 abhi tak aap pakistan ko hi kashmir main ghuspaith or uske halaat ke liye jimmedaar maanate rahe honge
 But this exclusive report from India Today and Aaj Tak will change your perspective
 aap ye jaanakar hairaan rah jaaenge ki kashmir ko aaj pakistan se zyada china se khatra he
 Seeing the documents of China Pakistan Economic Corridor i
e
 CPEC, India Today, you will be convinced that today Pakistan in the case of Kashmir is nothing more than the pawn of China
 darasal mahabuuba mufti ke is bayaan ko tab kuch logon ne jammu-kashmir kii kanoon vyavastha par unki kamjor hoti pakad ko chhipaane kii dhaal kii tarah liya tha
 But Mehbooba was telling the truth
 china bahut shaatiranaa tareeke se pakistan ke raste kashmir par kabja jamaane kii firaaq main he
 Our weak neighbor is willing to enslave China for this
 iskaa phayda uthaakar china paak adhikrut kashmir main andhadhundh nivesh kar rahaa he
 India has previously opposed China's One Belt One Road policy
 yah sadak paak adhikrut kashmir se guzarati he or iskaa makasad kashmir main apni paith badhaane kaa he, lekin china rukne ko taiyaar nahin
 We considered the growing Khunnas from India limited to Arunachal and Bhutan
 lekin ajtak ke haath chini sarkaar ke kuch aise dastavej lage hai jinhen dekhne ke baad chintaa kii lakeeren tedi ho jaati hai, jinhen dekhne ke baad bharat kii sarkaar bhi pareshaan ho jaaegi
 After seeing those, the remaining hopes of any brotherhood and friendship from China will also be broken
 pakistan ke saath milakar wo ek aisa khel khel rahaa he jiske baad pakistan china kii kathputli banakar rah jayega jise beijing ke ishaare par naachna hoga or ye sabakuch kashmir par kabje ke liye ho rahaa he
 China has prepared a blueprint for 20 years

 It will take over the national highways and control the stock exchange
 endie saansad rajeev chandrashekhar kaa kahana he, 'china ko maaloom he ki POK dispute he
 If China helps there then it will be at a disadvantage, because India always claims that POK belongs to us
 china jaan chukaa he bharat ab apane hit se samjhauta nahin karegaa
 'meaning China has made full preparations to take Pakistan's economic key for infiltration in Kashmir, and for this it is investing billions of dollars every year
 china kii hukuumaten is khel ko bahut shaatiranaa andaaj main anjaam de rahi hai
 China has exposed its fearsome intentions by vetoing the United Nations on India's campaign to declare jaish-e-mohammed terrorist Masood Azhar an international terrorist
 is mudde par jediu netaa sharad yadav ne kaha, "yah baat kisi se chhipi nahin he ki china pakistan main puri tarah se paisa laga rahaa he or use majboot banane main laga he
 It is a failure of our foreign policy that today we have very good relations with any neighboring country, from China to Pakistan, to Nepal
 "aapako bataa den ki bharat ko gherne ke liye yah blueprint baqayada china ke rashtriya vikaas evam sudhaar ayog ne taiyaar kiya he
 Moreover, the Planning Commission of Pakistan has approved this blue print
 beijing kii renmin uniwarsity ne is blue print kaa akalan kiya he
 It is well known that after the twin tower attack of 9 / 11, America has shown strong attitude to Pakistan on the issue of terrorism
 america se pakistan kii is duuri ko china ne bhunaaya or uski kangaali kaa phayda uthaakar uski seemaa main ghusata chalaa gaya
 The result of this infiltration was that China's business with Pakistan was $ 4 billion in 2007, it became $ 14 billion in 2016
 matlabachin-paak kaarobaardas saal main tigune se bhi zyada ho gaya
 Today Pakistan alone accounts for 40% of the total FDI in Pakistan
 pakistan ke parmaanu kaaryakramon ko mil rahichini madadse puri duniya waakif he
 But now he is not satisfied with this

 film main ab ye bhoomikaayen ranbir singh or deepika padukon nibhaa rahe hai
 When asked about this film, Aishwarya said, from the beginning of the film (bajirao Mastani), he wanted to get special actors

 ek bank ke shubh sandesh letterpad par ek chor ne likhaa khat
 Letter whose words describe despair
 khat jiskaa har tedha-medhaa akshar teen bacchon ke us pita kii traasadee ko udhed kar rakh detaa he
 That four-line letter is certainly a hallmark of libel and it cannot be justified from anywhere, but the letter's unfounded evidence is that a section of the country, plagued by poverty and inflation, has worn its lines on the hollow wall of crime
 Used to be

 The thief who wrote this particular letter has written this letter sitting on the branch manager's chair

 This failed theft attempt went on Sunday night and the letter was received by the bank employees on Monday morning
 bank kaa taala or darwaja tutaa dekh karmchaariyon ne aanan-fanan main police ko phone kiya, jisamen kuch fingerprint or is khat ke alaava kuch nahin mila
 According to the police, all the money and precious jewels of the bank were kept in the strong room, due to which the thief could not succeed in his plan

 Opposition seems to be united in support of the AAP amid the sword hanging over the membership of 20 Aam Aadmi Party mlas
 pehle trinmul congress, phir CPIM ke samarthan ke baad ab sharad yadav ne AAP kaa samarthan karte hue chunaav ayog kii sifarish ko aloktantric bataaya he
 At the same time, amid questions arising on the Election Commission, Sanjay Raut of Shiv Sena has said that the decision of the Election Commission is under the scanner
 aise faisle die jane par chunaav ayog se sawaal hona saamaanya he
 The commission itself is responsible for this
 sharad yadav ne twit kiya, 'AAP vidhayakon kii sadsyta radd karnaa aloktantric he, kyonki unka paksh suna hi nahin gaya he, ye nyaay ke khilaaf he
 Nowadays the country's constitutional institutions are being misused

 This will not increase the credibility of the Election Commission as an autonomous, independent and impartial institution
 karaat ne kaha, 'ham chunaav ayog ke is faisle kaa virodh karte hai
 'brinda Karat: EC decision to disqualify 20 AAP mlas is undemocratic & selective in procedure & substance
 It does not enhance the credibility of the election commission as an autonomous, independent, impartial body
 We strongly oppose the decision of the EC

 Whether the delay in announcing the Gujarat election or the disqualification of AAP mlas for the post of profit has just been taken, the impartiality of the commission is under doubt
 yah janatantr ke liye khatre kii ghanti he
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has said that the Trinamool Congress is supportive of the AAP, that a constitutional body cannot be used for political revenge
 mamata ne kaha, ye durbhagyapurna he ki vidhayakon ko chunaav ayog kii ore se apana paksh rakhane kaa mauka bhi nahin diya gaya
 CM Mamta said that at such a time her party is with AAP and Kejriwal
 a Constitutional body cannot be used for political vendetta
 The 20 AAP mlas were not even given a hearing by the Hon EC
 Most unfortunate
 This goes against the principles of natural justice
 At this hour we are strongly with@arvindkejriwaland his team— Mamata Banerjee (@mamataofficial)19 January 2018 Could it be that all 1800 residents of a village have the same date of birth? ji haa, aisa hi kuch hua he madhya pradesh ke rajgad jile ke mundlabrol gaanv main
 The date of birth of all 1800 people living in the village is 1 January
 haalanki sabhi ke janm kaa saal alag-alag darj he
 Let us tell how this miracle happened
 ye karnama gaanv main aadhaar card banane ai ek company kaa he
 What elderly, what children, what young, what women, the company made everyone's Aadhaar cards, but they all recorded the date of birth
 gaanv waalon kaa daawa he ki unhone apni sabhi jaankariyaan sahi sahi di thim, lekin jab aadhaar card banakar unke paas pahunche to sabhi par janmatithi 1 janvari darj dekhakar wo hairaan rah gaye
 When the villagers wanted to contact the contractor of Aadhaar card making company, they could not be found
 gaanv vaale isaki shikaayat esadm se karne ja rahe hai
 According to SDM Praveen Prajapati, he came to know from the media that the same date of birthday is registered on the Aadhar card of all the people of the village
 esadm ke mutabik sabhi kii janmatithi thik karai jaaegi, iske liye tehseeldaar se jaanch karne ko kaha he
 Prajapati said that these Aadhaar cards were made before he was posted here
 gaanv ke rahane vaale lokesh singh ne bataaya ki is galati kii vajah se unka army kaa form riject ho gaya
 Lokesh said that action should be taken against the company which committed this mistake

 siem arvind kejariwal ne ditisi kii 200 or 50 cluster bason main 'kaaman mobility card' se safar karne ko hari jhandi de di
 Delhi has more than 3900 DTC and 1600 cluster buses in which millions of people travel daily
 vahiin dilli metro main bhi safar karne waalon kaa aankada lakhon kaa he
 In such a situation, if both of them can travel with the same card, then people will benefit greatly
 parivahan mantri kailash gahalot kaa daawa he ki 'kaaman mobility card' ko 1 april se dilli kii tamamditisi or cluster basonmen istemaal kiya ja sakegaa
 The team of 'aaj Tak' traveled in a DTC bus with Transport Minister Kailash Gehlot and also checked the reality of 'common Mobility Card'
 dilli sachivalay se rajghat tak safar ke dauraan gahalot ne bataaya ki conductor ke paas electronic tikating mashin hogi
 While boarding the bus, the conductor will have to give a smart card of the metro telling whoever takes the ticket of Rs 5, 10 or 15
 card koelectronic mashinaki screen par jaise hi rakhaa jayega, card se paisa cat jayega or tikat kii parchi baahar niklegi
 The metro smart card has a magnetic strip and each card has a number, which will also be recorded on the DTC ticket
 iske alaava mantri rajendra gautam bhi ditisi kii bas main 'ajtak' samvaadadaata ke saath savaar ho gaye
 Gautam told that due to the 'common Mobility Card' the problem of open money in buses will be completely eliminated
 haalanki card kaa balance richarge karne ke lieditisiun bas depo kaa rukh karnaa hoga jahaan bason ke masik paas banaaye jate hai yaa metro stesan ke counter se bhi balance richarge karaayaa ja saktaa he
 Currently, you will be able to use 'common Mobility Card' on these 20 routes of Delhi-901 (mangolpuri to Kamla Market) 957 (rohini Sector-22 to Shivaji Stadium) 970 (avantika to JLN Stadium) 971 (avantika to Anand Vihar) a990 (rithala) Village to Shivaji Stadium) 206 (bhajanpura to Mayur Vihar Phase III) 348 (mori Gate to Mayur Vihar Phase III) 258 (mori Gate to Chauhan Patti) 211 (mori Gate to Mayur Vihar Phase Three) 253 (mori Gate to Yamuna Vihar) Similarly Rajagh 39 (lake to Trinagar) 307 (kamla Market to Trilokpuri 27 block) 392 b (kashmiri Gate to Airport T-3) 419 (old Delhi Railway Station to Ambedkar Nagar) 429 (old Delhi Railway Station Kalkaji DDA Flats) 729 ( Mori Gate to Kapashera Border) 918 (delhi Secretariat to Kamrudin Nagar) Airport Express Service (kashmiri Gate to Airport T-3) Ghaziabad (bhajanpura to Ghaziabad) and Delhi Tronica City (mori Gate to t Ronika City) reliance jeeyo ko takkar dene ke liye baaki telecom companiyaan bhi roj nae-nae ophers nikaal rahi hai

 fawaad hossain ne kaha, 'kohinoor ko bhi pakistan ke lahore sthit sangrahalay main waapas karnaa chahie, jahaan kaa wo he
 'fully endorse the demand that the British empire must apologize to the nations of Pakistan, India and Bangladesh on Jallianwala Massacre and Bengal famine
 
 These tragedies are the scar on the face of Britain, also Kohenoor must be returned to Lahore museum where it belongs— Ch Fawad Hussain (@fawadchaudhry) April 11, 2019, please tell UK Prime Minister Teresa on Wednesday, a day before her tweet
 Had regretted the 100th anniversary of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre
 unhone is hatyakand ko britain kii itihaas main 'sharmasaar karne vaala dhabba' qaraar diya
 However, he did not apologize on the murder
 theresa me ne kaha, '1919 ke jaliyanvaala baag narsanhaar kii ghatana british bhartiya itihaas par sharmasaar karne vaala dhabba he
 As Queen Elizabeth II said before visiting Jallianwala Bagh in 1997, it is a sad example of our past history with India
 'unhone kaha, 'jo kuch hua or logon ko vednaa jhelni padi, uske liye hamen gaharaa khed he

 'leader of the opposition Labor Party, Jeremy Corbyn, demanded that those killed in the massacre deserve a full clear apology for that incident
 jaliyanvaala baag narsanhaar amritsar main 1919 main april maah main baisakhi ke din hua tha
 After Britain apologized and did not apologize, Pakistan has clarified its stand on this issue by asking for forgiveness

 com / hjnqdjwkib narendra modi sarkaar kaa pehla rail bajet pesh ho gaya
 With all the breathtaking talk and promises, the public was spared the increase in the price of tickets in this budget as they had already increased
 is bajet main bullate train chalaane kaa piem modi kaa priy sapana bhi he
 Apart from this, there are plans to increase the speed of trains
 nau rooton par tej raftaar trainon ke chalane se yatriyon ko bahut aasaani hogi
 Apart from this, there has also been talk of running high speed trains in the rail quadrant
 vittiya sankat se jujhate railway ke liye iskaa karyanvayan bahut kathin hoga kyonki rail mantri ne khud hi mana he ki rail vistaar or behatari kii saikadon pariyojnaayen lambit padi hai
 Some projects have been hanging for more than 4 to 30 years
 jaahir he ki inhen puraa karne ke liye railway ko lakhon karod rupye chahie jo uske paas nahin he
 How the Railways will complete these will be known only in the next budget
 lekin ek acchhee baat he ki rail mantri ne relon main nijee nivesh kaa rasta khol diya he or epadiai ko bhi hari jhandi dikhaa di he
 This will make it easier to raise money because new schemes cannot be completed by selling railway tickets
 yah bhi gahare santosh kii baat he ki railway ne is disha main gambhirtha se sochna shuru kiya he
 The Indian Railways, which takes two crore 30 lakh people to their destination every day, is in dire need of support
 railway apane parichaalan se mahaj 6 paise prati rupye hi bachaa paati he jisase uski bhavi yojanaon ko puraa nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 It needs to be run like any commercial organization and this is considered by the Railway Minister
 iske bagaiyr desh main sabase zyada rojgaar dene vaale is sanghathan ko apane pairon par khadaa ho paanaa mushkil hoga
 To keep the railway moving, it is necessary that new blood be filled in it, which will be possible only with large-scale investment
 samasya yah he ki relon se har varg ke log yatra karne waalon main garibon kii taadaad bahut zyada he jo tikaton kii keemton main badhotaree ko jhel nahin sakate
 Therefore, the Railway Minister has to think more towards bringing foreign funds and investment in Railways
 jahaan tak bullate train kii baat he to uske liye piem modi swayan pahal kar rahe hai
 The Railway Minister has done a great job by paying attention to two important things of the Railways
 railway kii sabase badi samasya he suraksha kii or uske baad safai kii
 He has announced several steps regarding these two
 relon or yatriyon kii suraksha bahut mahtavpurn he or iske liye unhone thos kadamon kii ghoshnaa kii he
 On the other hand, the services of professional agencies for cleaning are also good
 yatriyon ke liye yah acchhee khabar he kyonki zyaadaatar trainon main safai kii badi samasya rahati he
 It is necessary to increase the cleanliness of trains and stations and for this the railway does not have a system
 ab profeshnal agenciyon ke kaam karne se yah samasya kaaphi had tak suljhegi
 But people also have to understand their responsibility
 relon main khan-paan vyavastha ko behatar banane ke liye bhi rail mantri ne privet companiyon kaa sahaara lene kii baat kahi he
 He proposed that well-known restaurant chains be added for this
 abhi relon ke khan-paan se yatri santusht nahin hai or ve usamen behatari chaahate hai
 This will also increase the pride of the railways and will also facilitate people
 nai trainen chalaane ke apane pralobhan ko rail mantri roak nahin paae or unhone 58 nai trainon kii ghoshnaa bhi kar di he
 It has five premium trains from which the Railways will get money
 lekin behatar hota ki vah itani sari nai trainon kii bajaay apana dhyaan puraani trainon ke parichaalan par rakhte kyonki aaj bhi saikadon gadiyaan let se chalati hai
 However, it can be said that the floor is far away and the path is complicated
 america main bhartiya mul ke ek vyakti ne pajal khilne ko lekar ek tippanee kiye jane par apane 66 saal ke pita kii hathaudaa maar kar kathith taur par hatya kar di
 The 33-year-old man named Vinayak Shanbag has been arrested
 dayton bich news jarnal kii khabar ke anusaar, is vyakti ne apane pita panduran shanbagh ke sar par, unke sote samay kareeb 10 pound vajan ke hathode se baar baar prahaar kiya
 Last Saturday, when the police arrived at the family's residence at Holy Hill Home in Florida, there was only blood on the bedroom walls
 police ke anusaar, vinayak ne bataaya ki vah or uske pita ek pajal khel rahe the ki pita ne kuch kaha jisase vah pa
 Reshma became
 vah raat bhar sochataa rahaa or phir usne pita par hamalaa karne kaa faisla kiya
 The country's largest insurance company Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) has decided to introduce a system whereby policyholders will be able to avail claims and pay premiums from any of the 2100 branches of the company
 pariyojna ke 2011 tak puraa ho jane kii ummidelaisi ke chairman tii es vijayan ne kaha premium kaa bhugtan bharat main kahin se bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 We have done this
 ab ham clem kaa bhugtan kisi bhi shakha se karne kii yojana bana rahe hai

 We know of only two Navratras occurring in the year, Chaitra or Vasantik Navratra and Ashwin or Shardiya Navratri
 iske atirikt do or navaratri bhi hai jiname vishesh kaamanaayon kii siddhi kii jaati he
 It is called Gupta Navratri due to lesser knowledge of people or its hiddenness
 bataa den, saal main do baar gupt navaratri aati he - magh shukla paksh main or asarh shukla paksh main
 In this way, there are four Navratras in a year
 yah chaaron hi navaratri ritu parivartan ke samay manaae jate hai
 The importance of these four Navratras is mentioned in the Mahakal Samhita and all the Shakta texts
 iname vishesh tarah kii ichha kii purti tathaa siddhi praapt karne ke liye puja or anushthan kiya jaataa he
 This time the secret Navaratri of Ashadha month will be from 13 July to 21 July
 21 saal baad bana adbhut sanyog, amavasya par karen ye upaykya antar he saamaanya or gupt navaratri main?- saamaanya navaratri main aamtaur par satvik or tantric puja donon kii jaati he
 At the same time, mostly Tantric worship is done in Gupta Navratri
 - gupt navaratri main aamtaur par zyada prachaar prasar nahin kiya jaataa, apni sadhana ko gopneey rakhaa jaataa he 
 - The more secretive the worship and desire in secret Navaratri, the greater the success
 kya hogi gupt navaratri main maa kii puja vidhi ?- nau dinon ke liye kalash kii sthapana kii ja sakati he
 - If the Kalash is established then both the Vela Mantra should be recited by chanting, Chalisa or Saptashati
 - donon hi samay aarti bhi karnaa acha hoga 
 - Offer both the Vela bhoga to the mother, the simplest and best enjoyment is cloves and betasha
 - maa ke liye laal phool sarvottam hota he par maa ko aak, madar, doob or tulsi bilkul na chadhayen
 Keep your food and diet Satvik for the entire nine days
 jaane, kya he tulsi ke paudhe kaa mahatv or iske phaaydagupta navaratri kaa mahaprayog- ek lakdi kii chaowkee par laal kapadaa bichhaaen
 - Install a mother statue or replica on it
 - maa ke samaksh ek bada ghi kaa ekamukhi deepak jalaaen
 - Chant the specific mantra of mother in the morning and evening 108 times
 - mantra hoga - "uun ain hrin clin chamundaay viche"- apni kaamana purti kii prarthana karen

 In which it was told how Saudi Defense Minister and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is creating instability in Arab countries through proxy war in Yemen and Syria

 The agency has distributed leaflets related to it on a large scale
 isse khafa saudi arab ke kade virodh jataane ke baad germany ke videsh mantralay ne agency ko fatkaar bhi lagaai he
 Saudi's attitude is unexpected, according to the news published in the English newspaper 'the Independent', the BND report has had little effect outside Germany
 aisa isliye kyonki jis vakt yah report chhapi thi antarrashtriya media main paris aatanki hamalaa chaaya hua tha
 But the BND report indicates that Kisoudirab is following an unpredictable policy
 jiskaa sabase bada udhaaharan iran se sabhirajanyiksambandhon ko khatm kar lenaa he
 The report described King Salman's ambition as dangerous
 king abdulla kii maut ke baad badali nitiis saal kii shuruyaat main hi shiya dharmaguru al-nimr ke saath 46 logon ko saudi ne faansee de di
 Saudi tried to turn Sunni Muslim-majority countries on its side
 saudi arab ke is kadam ko iran ke netritv ke liye khuli chunauti ke taur par dekha gaya
 According to the report, in the past, the Saudis have generally tried to keep all their options open
 agar uske kuch deshon se matbhed bhi hue to vah isamen ulajhaa nahin lekin beete saal janvari main king abdulla kii maut ke baad se saudi kii raajnneeti karavat le chuki he
 Aggressive policy against Syria, Yemen The BND has also named in its report the countries against which Saudi has taken an aggressive and combative stance
 report ke mutabik beete saal kii shuruyaat main saudi ne kai sainya samoohon ko apana samarthan diya
 The Saudis first supported al-qaeda-linked al-nusra Front and Ahrar al-sham

 In Yemen, militant groups in Saudi are also continuing attacks on Huti
 iran se yuddh kii sthiti nahin aegibeete kuch samay main dekha gaya he ki saudi jaanboojhkar iran se sambandhon main tanaav badha rahaa he
 But in an interview to 'the Economist', Prince Mohammad Salman dismissed the possibility of war with Iran
 unhone kaha ki saudi or iran kaa yuddh duniya ke liye baari sabit hoga
 So we assure that nothing like this will happen

 ajit vadnerkar peshey se bhale patrkaar hai lekin shabdon kaa itihaas-bhugol-sanrachana khangaalane kii kshamta unka parichay badalati he
 She takes it to such an inaccessible summit of words where the soldiers of the pen are afraid to go
 vadnerkar kipustakashbdon kaa safar kaa teesraa bhaag hamaare haathon main he
 The top critic about this series is Dr
 namvar singh ne thik hi kaha he ki ''aadmi kii janm kundali bananaa to saral he, shabdon kii janm kundali bananaa bada kathin he
 Knowing how and when they were born is a difficult task to find
 aise maahaul main jab patrakarita bhashaa kaa saath chhod rahi ho, mujhe khushi he ki vadnerkar ne yah jimmaa liya
 The tunes are sure
 ek marathi bhashi aadmi ne yah kosh taiyaar kiya he, jo ham hindi waalon ke liye chunauti he
 "vadnekar stays near any contemporary word, fumbles it and then searches for it from the point of view of a journalist, sometimes a linguist, sometimes a sociologist
" ve utane hi detel main jate hai, jitani der ek aam jigyaasu pathak kii dilchaspee bani rahe
 For example, look at his tip on the word mascara
 It is made from the Arabic word mascara and the barista has come through persian-urdu
 hindi main iskaa arth vidooshak yaa hansaane vaale shaks ke taur par he
 But mosquito means good face deterioration
 arab saudagaron ke saath yah shabd spain or italy pahunchakar maskhera ban gaya
 Mascara in French, which means to paint the face
 angreji main iskaa rup mask yani mukhauta hua
 In the medieval era, the prankster entered the world of makeup and cosmetics and transformed into a mascara
 is kaam main vadnerkar ke patrkaar kii chaikas drushti satat sakriy dikhti he
 That is why, in the titles of word groups, he has put a question of readability and aesthetics
 namoonay dekhieh maraham se pehle hue marhoom (shabd sandarbhah maraham, malham, marhoom, maharoom, vaikunthvasi); fokat ke phugge main phoonk bharna (fokat, phoonk, funkani, phufakaar); nikammon kii lid or khaad nirmaan (lid, paleed, lendi, majja); bhaade kii dein hai bhandua or bhaadu
 Vadnekar does not even bother to give the detail when needed
 bolchaal ke ek shabd jhandubaam kii jaden talashte hue ve chaar pannon tak jate hai or iske arth ke virodhabhas ko bhi ujagar karte hai
 The term idiom refers to a foolish, boonish or useless person
 ve bataate hai ki hindi shabdhsagar main jhandula shabd he jiskaa arth he aisa balak jiskaa janm ke baad se mundan na hua ho
 But even this flag does not reach around the idiom
 lekhak ne yahaan vyakhya kii he ki sir se bal hataane kaa arth paanditya or morrkhtaa donon se he
 In the same way, they catch the word room, came from Europe and comrades meeting other languages also originated from it which means companion
 lekin bolchaal main ise sabhyavaadee vichaaron vaale shaks ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Preparations for the fourth are underway after this third stop with 184 chapters
 samay ke saath shabdon kii badalati dhvaniyon or unke prayog ko jaananaa vastav main dilachasp he

 hamaare desh par angrejon kii dhamak badhati chali gai or duusare shaskaon kii pakad dhili hoti chali gai
 The Battle of Plassey was fought on June 23 in 1757 between the British East India Company and the Nawab of Bengal
 1
 The British East India Company received this decisive victory under the leadership of Robert Clive
 2
 This battle took place at the place called Plasi on the banks of the Ganges river in Nadia district of Bengal
 3
 Nawab of Bengal Siraj-ud-daulah fought with 40,000 soldiers and 50 French cannons
 4
 The British East India Company had 1000 British and 2,000 Indian soldiers
 5
 This important war laid the foundation of the British rule in India and the French continued to stare

 The Nawab was killed by Mir Jafar's son Meeran immediately after the war
 shahid kapur kii film "batti gul meter chaalu" 21 sitambar ko relies ho rahi he
 The trailer of the film is very much liked by the fans

 In an interview by Spotbyco, the film's script writer Vipul Rawal made a big revelation
 unhone bataaya wo film ke original script riter hai, wo khud sabase pehle film kaa ofer lekar imran khan ke paas gaye
 But he refused to do the film due to the busy schedule
 khaas baat ye he ki us samay vipul, prerana aroda se film ko produs karne kii baat kar rahe the or khud film ko nirdeshit karnaa chaahate the
 After this, Vipul also reached John Abraham
 lekin us dauraan jon haal hi main relies hui "parmaanu" par kaam karne kii taiyaari main the
 Because of this, he too refused to do the film
 aakhirkaar vipul ko shahid kapur ke paas janaa padaa
 Shahid wanted Nishikant to direct the film, as his "toilet: Ek Prem Katha" was liked by both critics and audiences
 vipul ne shahid kii baat par raji ho gaye
 He said, "I agree, Star always wants to work with a successful director
 mujhe koi ishyu bhi nahin he, mere paas achh story he
 i want to tell him on screen
 "bataa den ki "batti gul meter chaalu" main bijli ke badhate bill ko centre main rakhkar an aadmi se jude sawaal uthaae gaye hai
 Such stories are often heard

 The dispute between the Delhi government and the Lieutenant Governor over the appointment of Shakuntala Gamlin as the acting Chief Secretary of Delhi has now taken a new turn
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne gamelin ko yah pad nahin sanbhaalane ko kaha tha, lekin uske baavjood gamelin ne kaaryakari mukhya sachiv kaa charge le liya he
 The Delhi government has accused the BJP of 'coup' through the Lieutenant Governor
 darasal dilli sarkaar ke mukhya sachiv keke sharma 10 din kii chuttee par gaye hai, jinke sthaan par uparajyapal ne gamelin ko niyukt kiya tha
 Delhi government's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has termed it as a conspiracy to overthrow the BJP through the Lieutenant Governor, while the opposition parties are calling it a political stunt for Kejriwal
 purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit kaa kahana he ki kejariwal ji yaa to samvidhan jaanate nahin hai yaa vah jaanane kii koshish nahin kar rahe hai
 The constitutional position of Delhi is very different from other states
