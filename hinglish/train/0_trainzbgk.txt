 to aakhir arvind kejariwal ne dilli kaa kila fatah kar hi liya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'baazigari' and Amit Shah's 'chanakya Niti' were left behind
 
 
 to kya maan liya jaae ki modi kaa karishma feekaa pad rahaa he yaa phir mukaable main maujuud doosraa khilaadi sachmuch itnaa taqatvar or daanv-pench vaala he, jiske aage bijepi ke tamaam suurama maar kha gaye
 Before the results came, Amit Shah had said that if Delhi's experiment is successful, no one can defeat BJP for the next 25 years
 meraa maananaa he ki na modi kaa karishma feekaa padaa he, na hi amit shah kii 'chanakya niti' asafal hui he, kyonki vastav main modi kaa koi karishma na pehle tha, na ab he, or jab koi karishma tha hi nahin to uske fike padane kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Similarly, till now the BJP has been winning not by Amit Shah's strategy, but by taking advantage of the situation in different states and the split in the opposition
 yah to modibhakt media he, jisane ise karishme or ranneeti kaa naam de diya
 Don't know why people forget that even after the opposition scattered in the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had brought 282 seats by only 31 per cent votes
 isamen agar endie ko mili vot bhi jod den to kul saadhe 38 fisadi vot hi unhen mili the
 Earlier, it was hardly possible that by bringing so few votes, a party could form a government with such majority at the center
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad, jitne bhi rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hue hai, vahaan ke halaat dilli se bilkul alag the
 For example, in Haryana, the anti-incumbency factor was working fiercely against the Congress and there was no option but BJP, so the BJP won
 vahiin, jharkhand main bhi yahi haal tha ki vipaksh ekajute nahin tha, jiskaa phayda bijepi ko mila
 Maharashtra had the same situation
 log congress sarkaar se tang aa chuke the or vipaksh main bikharaav tha
 Somehow the BJP and Shiv Sena governments were formed again
 yahi haal jammu-kashmir kaa bhi rahaa
 People were fed up with the National Conference and when the PDP and BJP appeared as an alternative, people chose them
 kehane kaa matlab he, jahaan bhi mukaable main thos vikalp tha, logon ne use chun liya
 It is also worth noting that in these states there was no such charismatic leader whom the public could trust
 jahaan-jahaan rajyon main karishmai vyaktitv ke dhani netaa hai, vahaan modi kaa jaadu nahin chalaa he
 In the presence of leaders such as Jayalalithaa in Tamil Nadu, Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal, Naveen Patnaik in Odisha and Chandrasekhar Rao in Telangana, Modi could not do anything
 vahiin, agar rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhatisgarh main bijepi itani siten jiti bhi he to isamen rajya ke netaaon kii badi bhoomika or congress kii patali haalat bade kaaran hai
 At the same time, Narendra Modi and Amit Shah were tested for the first time in Delhi
 yahaan logon ke paas arvind kejariwal ke taur par majboot vikalp tha, so, nateeja sabake saamne he
 If the opposition fought a lesson from Delhi and fought in Bihar, Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, then the contest could be quite interesting
 haalanki dilli main jeet ke baad bhi kejariwal ko rashtriya str par ek vikalp ke taur par ubharne main samay or kaaphi mehnat lagegi, lekin agar vipaksh ke saath milakar ve bijepi ke khilaaf khadey hote hai to zyada asardaar honge

 parmaanu aapurtikarta samooh (enesji) main america kii lakh koshishon or pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bharsak prayaason ke baavjood bharat ko entry nahin mili
 Seven countries, led by China, opposed India at the Seoul meeting
 is asafalataa ke liye america ne china ko na sirf khari-khari sunai he, balki ek hafte ke baad usne yahaan tak kaha ki sirf china ke kaaran hindustan enesji kaa sadsy nahin ban paaya
 The US said that it is committed to include India in the NSG group
 iske saath hi usne kaha ki bas ek desh ke kaaran is par bani antarrashtriya sahmati ko nahin todaa ja saktaa or jor diya ki aise sadsy ko javabdeh banaaya janaa chahie
 US Deputy Minister of Political Affairs Tom Shannon said, "america is committed to ensuring India's entry into the NSG
" america ke is sheersh rajanyik ne 'dukh' jataayaa ki sol main pichley hafte samooh kii salanaa baithak main unki sarkaar bharat ko sadsy banane main safal nahin rahi
 We believe that in a consent-based organization, a country can break the consent, but in doing so it should be made accountable and not isolated
 ''mil baithkar sochen sol main kya hua'shainan ne aage kaha, 'meraa maananaa he ki ham aage badhen, bharat or america mil baithkar vimarsh karen ki sol main kya hua, rajanyik prakriya par najar rakhen jo mahatvapurn he or dekhen ki agali baar safal hone ke liye ham or kya kar sakate hai
 Describing India as a 'carrier of stability' in the Asia Pacific region, "china is doing insanity in the Asia Pacific", said Tom Shannon, US Minister for Political Affairs, also said that what China is doing in the South China Sea is "insanity" 'and he wants New Delhi to play a larger role in the Indian Ocean
 videsh seva santhaan main baatcheet ke dauraan shainan ne kaha ki china ke badhane par ankush lagaana badi chunauti he
 The US wants to work with India to have a strong and wide presence in the Indian Ocean
 'bharat enesji kaa hakdaar'parmaanu aprasar ke kshetra main bharat ko vishwasaneey or mahatvapurn shakti bataate hue shainan ne kaha, 'ham is baat par patibaddh hai ki bharat parmaanu aapurtikarta samooh main shaamil ho
 We believe that the kind of work we have done, the civil nuclear agreement, the manner in which India has controlled itself deserves it
 ' enesji main bharat ke pravesh sambandhi prayaas par unhone kaha ki bharat ko is samooh main shaamil kiya jaae, iske liye america lagaataar kaam karata rahegaa
 'we are sad for Sol', Shannon said
 jaishankar se bhi mulaakaat kii
 He said the recent inclusion of India in the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) shows that it is a 'responsible and important country on the path of nuclear non-proliferation'

 The court had also clarified in the previous hearing that the deadline to complete the NRC process would not be extended beyond July 31, 2019

 whats ap ke data ko fasebuk se jodne ke maamle main supreme court main nijee data or privesi ke liye yachika daayar kii gai he
 The Supreme Court has issued a notice to the Center, TRAI, whatsapp and Facebook asking them to give it in two weeks
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki har vyakti kii privesi kaa maamla he or centre sarkaar dwaara iske liye koi niyam banaaya janaa chahie
 The case of whatsapp sharing data with Facebook is a violation of the right to privacy
 isliye tri dwaara koi niyam banaaya janaa chahie
 This case is related to data of 155 million people
 tippaniyan The petition has challenged the decision of the Delhi High Court
 haalanki chif justise jees khehar ne yachikakarta se poocha ki ye free sarvice he
 If you fear data sharing, why do you use it? Either you take it or leave this service
 dilli hai court ne pichley saal 23 sitambar ko whatsap ko 25 sitambar tak kaa yujar data bhi delit karne ko kaha tha
 The High Court said that before September 25, if a user deletes his account and does not share it with Facebook, then the company will have to delete it from the information server
 lekin 25 sitambar ke baad ke data ko whatsap, fasebuk ke saath saajha kar saktaa he
 This decision was given by the High Court under a PIL in which the sharing policy of whatsapp has been questioned
 bataa den isse pehle whatsap ne apni niti main badlaav kar apane yuzars kaa data fasebuk ke saath share karne kii baat kahi thi
 Its purpose was to deliver accurate advertising to the users
 yachika main dilli hoicourt ke faisle ko chunauti di gai he
 However, Chief Justice JS Khehar asked the petitioner that it was free service
 agar aapako data share hone kaa dar he to aap ise istemaal kyon karte hai? yaa to aap ise lijie yaa is sarvice ko chod dijie
 On 23 September last year, the Delhi High Court had asked whatsapp to delete the user data till 25 September
 hoicourt kaa kahana tha ki 25 sitambar se pehle agar koi yujar apana acount delit karata he or use fasebuk ke saath saajha nahin karata he to company ko soochna sarwar se delit kerani hogi
 But whatsapp can share the data after September 25 with Facebook
 yah faisla hoicourt ne us janhit yachika ke tahat diya tha, jisamen whatsap kii shering policy par sawaal uthaaya gaya he
 Before that, whatsapp had changed its policy to share its users' data with Facebook
 iskaa makasad yuzars tak sateek vigyaapan pahunchaana tha
 This decision was given by the High Court under a PIL in which the sharing policy of whatsapp has been questioned

 hindu dharm main sawan kii tarah bhadon maheene kaa bhi vishesh mahatv he
 Just as the importance of Monday is in the spring, the Sunday of Bhadon also has a great importance
 manyata he ki is maheene bhagwaan vishnu apni neend puri karne ke baad jag jate hai
 This is the reason that by worshiping the Sun and Lord Vishnu on Sundays this whole month, the seeker gets special fruit
 ravivaar ko surya apni sabase zyada urja liye hote hai
 According to astrology, if the position of Sun in the horoscope of the native is not good, then he does not get respect in the society
 use jeevanabhar ksht rahata he
 There is no happiness in his life
 yahi vajah he ki ravivaar ke din kuch khaas kaary nahin karne kii salaah di jaati he
 Especially on the Sunday of Bhado, this work should not be done at all
 in kaaryon ko karne se surya grah ke kuprabhavon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Therefore, by keeping a few things in mind on Sunday, sun god can always be blessed
 
 
 bhado ke ravivaar main ye kaam karne se bachein--ravivaar ke din suryaast se purv namak kaa upyog na karen
 It is considered inauspicious to do so
 -yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki ravivaar ko raat hone se pehle sambhog nahin karnaa chahie
 No person should consume meat and alcohol on this day
 -aamtaur par log ravivaar ko hi bal kataate hai
 But it is believed that the sun is weakened by a haircut on Sunday
 isliye isadin bal kataane se or sir main tel maalish or doodh ko jalaane kaa kaary nahin karnaa chahie
 Avoid buying and selling things made of copper if possible on Sunday
 -is din nile, kaale va grey rang ke vastra na pahanen
 Do not wear shoes on this day if possible
 yadi in sabhi baton kaa aap bhadon main padane vaale har ravivaar ko khyaal rakhenge, to aapako kabhi bhi surya grah kii buree drushti kaa saamana nahin karnaa padegaa
 The Sun God will always maintain his grace over you
 rajdhani main chhaae pradooshan par dilli ke paryaavaran mantri imran hasan ne bada hi atapata jawaab diya he
 He has said that there is no emphasis on air
 engiti or court se fatkaar sunne vaali dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar ke paryaavaran mantri ne pradooshan ko naa roak paane main apni naakaami kaa iljaam kudarat ke maathe madh diya
 Question- It is being said that you did not take action in time
 jisaki vajah se dilli or aasapaas kii sthiti kharaab hui he
 Advisory was also issued several times by the Union Ministry of Environment? Emraan Hassan - We are doing the work that we had to do
 hawa par kisi kaa jor nahin he
 Crop burning is a major influence
 sirf dilli hi nahin puure ensiaar kii yahi sthiti he
 Question- Anil Madhav Dave, who is the Union Minister of Environment, says that only 20 percent smoke is caused by crop burning
 baaki kaa 80 pratishat dilli kii factriyaan hai?imran hasan- dilli main jo pradooshan he vah abhi nahin hua pehle se he
 But the Delhi government has taken several initiatives
 ham sab inishiative le rahe hai
 To eliminate this pollution, construction has been closed to fix Delhi's atmosphere
 badarpur vaala power plant band karvaa diya he
 Question- What was decided in the meeting to end this pollution? Imran Hassan- i thank Anil Madhav Dave ji that he called this meeting on environment
 un se request he ki jab china artificial barish kar saktaa he to ham kyon nahin
 Artificial rain should be done in Delhi and NCR
 sawaal- artificial barish se kya phayda hoga ?imran hasan- ham artifishal barish ko lekar scientiston se baat karenge
 So i have told them that this situation can happen anytime
 iskaa intjaam hamaare paas hona chahie
 Question- Why did the Delhi government wake up so late? Imran Hassan- You are saying that we will wake up late
 lekin ham log lagaataar paryaavaran ko lekar kaam kar rahe hai
 Since last year, we used to have meetings about this every 15 days
 jo dilli kii sthiti he isko lekar hamaari sarkaar lagaataar kaam kar rahi thi
 i can give you data as to what we have done because suddenly the wind stopped, due to crop burning, all these things happened due to this situation
 jaldi hi halaat thik ho jaaenge

 Rajamouli spoke with his producer friend and Arka mediaworks co-founder and CEO Shobu Yarlagadda about an ambitious film project and proposed to cast Tollywood's famous actor Prabhas in the lead role
 kuch hafte gahan soch-vichaar hua, jisamen is film ko do hisson main banane kaa faisla liya gaya or uske baad rajmouli ne hajaaron kalakaaron, takanicianon or shilpakaaron ko lekar bharat kii sabase mahangi film banane kaa kaam shuru kiya
 Because Mahishmati was not made in a day, Art Director Sabu Cyril and an army of 2,000 carpenters, painters and set builders created Mahishmati's empire in 2013 at Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad
 unhone na sirf do mahal or murtiyon banaarin, balki masini jaanavar jaise bail, ghode or hathi bhi banaae
 Prabhas tells about a book like "mahishmati Bible" which gave a lot of detail about the state, even things like the likes and dislikes of the people, their ways of sleeping and their main diet
 Information was also given in yuddh ke drishyon ke liye hajaaron kalakaaron ko liya gaya tha
 These scenes were foreseen by John Griffith, who worked for films such as Planet of Apps

 doosraa sawaal, ''katappa ne bahubali ko kyon maaraa
 "for the last two years, Rajamouli was trying his best not to leak any scene of Bahubali from Hyderabad and he was successful in it
 rajmouli kehete hai, ''agar ek line main iskaa jawaab mil jaataa to log is rahasy kaa pataa laga lete
 This is a big part of the upcoming film
 " unke pita ke
 V
 vijayendra prasad ne is film kii kahani likhi thi, unhone darshakon ko lubhaane ke liye ek behtareen ant kaa prasang taiyaar kiya
 Says Prasad, "though having a big budget helps to create an atmosphere and new techniques can be used in the film, ultimately the ability to maintain the audience's interest and curiosity in the story and the film is more important It holds
 "badhati laagat se chuta pasinaorelgadda kehete hai, ''log samaj rahe the ki ham murkh hai
 They rejected us even before the first part of the film was released
 bahubali se pehle arka mediaworks sirf teen filmein hi bana paaya tha, jinamein rajmouli kii maryaada ramanna (2010) thi, jise hindi main san of sardaar ke naam se banaaya gaya tha
 Many people were scared of sinking this project due to the skyrocketing budget of the film
 lekin arka mediaworks ke liye isse saavdhaan hone kaa koi vikalp nahin tha
 Says Yarlagadda, "I knew that the reason for this (increasing budget) is not someone's whims, but someone's wages
" "rajmouli or company ke bich ek dashak main jo bharosa kaayam hua tha, usee kii vajah se bahubali kaa nirmaan sambhav ho sakaa
 Due to this belief, Rajamouli could give Telugu superhit films like Magadheera (2009) and Eega (2012)
 yarlgadda kehete hai, ''main nahin samajhataa ki kisi duusare filmkaar par main itnaa adhik bharosa kar saktaa tha
 "rajamouli says," a mutual understanding between the producer and director is important
 agar film kii shuruyaat main aisa nahin hota he to film banane par bhi vah dikhaai detaa he
 "all India Film was born in early 2013 in Mumbai and Spice PR publicist Prabhat Chaudhary was called to Hyderabad and introduced to Rajmauli
 makasad thah uttar or pashchim bharat main apana prabhaav rakhane vaali agency kii madad se bahubali ko dakshin bharat se aage le janaa
 Chaudhary explains that Rajamouli in his presentation was closely describing the scene of a waterfall in the first part of the film
 ve kehete hai, ''main vah sunakar kho-sa gaya
 "chaudhary says," From the declaration of the film as the most expensive project, it surpassed the film of the South and achieved the status of national film
 "0 july, 2015 ko bahubalih da bigning ne nayaa record sthapit kiya or hindi main dab kii gai film kii pehle din kii kamai 5

 It is discussed about Part-2 that its earnings will outstrip Part-1

 Says Chaudhary, "the talk of an all-india film before Bahubali was a fantasy
 ab rasta taiyaar ho gaya he
 "it can be a model for Bollywood to work so extensively in creating exemplarfilm and promoting it for five years, while superstars are given importance in Bollywood
 dangal jaisi film banane vaale digni india ke purv pramukh siddharth roy kapur kehete hai ki hindi film birdari ke liye bahubali ankhen khol dene vaali film he
 The Hindi film fraternity relies on superstars for big films
 "bahubali ko jo baat or bhi prabhaavshaalee banaati he, vah yah he ki isane prabhas or rana daggubatti jaise kalakaaron ke saath itani badi kamyaabi hasil kii he, jabaki in kalakaaron ke bare main hindi filmon ke darshak zyada nahin jaanate
 He is primarily familiar with Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan
 kapur kehete hai, ''film kii kahani hi isamen asli star he
 You should salute the producers of the film, who spent so much money, time and effort in it, relying completely on the story
 iskaa bharpoor phayda bhi mila
 "his gesture was Rs 111 crore from a film dubbed in Hindi
 kii kamai kii ore he
 There is little work on the mix of fantasy and mythology in Bollywood
 ateet main janaa or nae sansar kii rachana karnaa sirf mahangaa kaam hi nahin he, balki bahut mehnat vaala bhi he
 Although earlier films based on fantasy have been made such as Aan (1952), Dharam Veer (1977) and Ajuba (1991) but after a huge failure of Drona (2008) and Veer (2010) and more recently Moenjodaro (2016), the makers Looks confident, has risen from it
 kapur kehete hai, ''aisa nahin he ki hamaari phantsi simit hai
 "they say the concern for us is whether technology and budget will yield
 ve kehete hai, ''akele studio ko dosha dena sahi nahin he
 To make a film without a big star one must have courage and ability
 "haalanki rajmouli, yarlgadda ko bharosa nahin he ki studio model bahubali jaisi film banane kii ijaajat detaa he
 While Hollywood produces action films that do not necessarily depend on superstars, Bollywood is still far away in terms of adopting such a model
 yarlgadda kehete hai, ''studio system kaa ek fremawork hota he
 Due to its stubbornness, there is little room for human judgment
 aapako kuch simaaon or niyamon main rahakar kaam karnaa hota he
 "desi fantasy storytelling Bahubali is being seen as a yardstick in Indian cinema for several reasons
 yah aisi film he jisamen filmkaar iske abhinaytaon se zyada mahatv rakhata he
 Rajamouli is not just a filmmaker, he is also an observer who takes viewers into a fictional world, the way Hollywood filmmakers like Steven Spielberg and Christopher Nolan create a unique world
 yah rajmouli kii anokhi kalpana hi he jisamen acshan or drishy darshakon ko ant tak baandhe rakhte hai
 Rajamouli may have a vision of the West but has been an ardent admirer of the Amar Chitra Katha comics, due to which stories of ancient times have attracted him to film, which also touches the heart if it pleases the eyes
 ve kehete hai, ''main jaanata hum ki agar aapke paas koi moulik kathavstu he or kahani ko acchhee tarah se pesh kiya jaataa he to yah kahin bhi apana asar dikhaaegi
 i believe we have epics like Mahabharata and Ramayana, we have great history and rich culture, but we have been ignoring it for a long time
 ham pashchim kii filmon kii nakal karne kii koshish karte hai
 i am not against it, but when we have a big treasure ourselves, it is sensible that we should use it
 "do bahubaliyon amrendra or mahendra ke rup main rajmouli or unke pita ne desi superhiro kii rachana kii he, jinaki shaareerik shaktiyaan aapako hollywood ke superhiro kii yaad dilaati hai, lekin unke vyaktitv bhartiya puranic kathaon ke nayakon se milte-julate hai
 Bijjaldev is a character similar to Shakuni Mama of the Mahabharata with his tricky tricks, Bhallaladeva is somewhat like Duryodhana, who believes that something has gone wrong with him and wants to gain the empire at any cost, Mahendra is a dutiful son
 , Who is like Lord Rama, and Amarendra is a great warrior like Bhima of Mahabharata, Katappa is a true servant of the kingdom like Hanuman of Ramayana
 bahubali part-1 ke prashansak lekhak amish treepathi kehete hai ki pracheen kaal kii kahaniyon ke zyaadaatar kahanikaron kii tarah rajmouli bhi bharat kii puranic gaathaon jaise ramayana, mahabharat or puraanon se prabhavit lagate hai
 He says, "the film attracted viewers because of its grandeur, as well as the fact that it has our stories, our palaces and our temples
" isamen vismay or hamaari chetana kaa vicitra mishran he, jabaki hollywood kii filmein dekhte hue hamen is tarah kaa judaav nahin mahasoos hota
 There is only an element of amazement in us
 aap bahubali ko dekhie, jise dekhakar lagata he ki yah apana nayak he
 "not just the character, but the philosophy of the film also attracts us
 treepathi kehete hai, ''yah ''dharm" kii baat karata he, or usase meraa matlab kisi majahab se nahin he, balki jeene ke sahi raste se he
 And in this "karma" shows how we should take care of him
 katappa ke charitra main karm kii yah bhaavana saaf dikhaai detii he, jo bahubali kaa ek behad sammanit paatr he or jiske sirf ek kaam se mahishmati ko baari kshati ho jaati he
 Tripathi says, "our tradition does not have completely good and completely evil characters
" hamaare yahaan shatru kii bhi apni kahani hoti he or aap usase bhi kuch sikh sakate hai
 "this is also revealed by the tag line of Bahubali: The Conclusion, which goes like this -" The battle between two right and none wrong, "now you are asked to decide whom you favor: Team Bahubali or Team Bhallaldev
 mithkon se rachaa itihaasis baat se koi matlab nahin he ki aapako kis tarah kii kahani pasand he, lekin yah baat nishchit he ki is film main aapako bharpoor manoranjan milegaa
 This is the reason why Karan Johar and Anil Thadani took the distribution rights for the Hindi version of this film
 johar apane sansmaran ansuteble boy main yah bataate hue ve kis tarah is film se jude the, likhte hai, ''main jaanata tha ki ve ek badi film bana rahe hai
 
 
 Which is very big on the level of budget, grandeur and story
 
 
 or main pakke taur par maanata hum ki quality, takanic or kahani ko pesh karne ke maamle main yah dakshin kii koi saadhaaran film nahin he, balki dakshin ko sammaan dilaane vaali film he
 Rajamouli specializes in the presentation of the story
 "acshan film (magadhira) ke nae avatar or badale kii kahani par bani iga ke saath rajmouli pehle hi dakshin se baahar apni yogyata kaa ehsaas kara chuke the
 But he still did not find a place in the pantheon of filmmakers like Mani Ratnam, Shankar, Ram Gopal Varma and Priyadarshan
 lekin telegu filmkaar ke
 Rajamouli, who was a disciple of Raghavendra Rao, has not only joined this club of filmmakers after Bahubali, but he has got the status of the new showman of India
 unhone telegu cinema urf tollywood, jise collywood apni takneekee takat ke bal par aksar dabaa diya karata tha, ko nakshe par laa diya he
 "bahubali is a symbol of extraordinary reconstruction after 75 years of Indian cinema," says Rao
 " raav ab tak 108 filmon ko diarennt kar chuke hai or bahubali film main prastutakarta ke taur par unka naam diya gaya he
 He says, "this film has opened the way for making films in all Indian languages on ancient stories
 " abhinayta rana daggubatti venkatesh kehete hai, ''rajmouli ko apni mahaan drushti or bhartiya cinema ko antarrashtriya str par le jane kaa shrey diya janaa chahie or unki tarif kii jaani chahie
 After Mayabazar (1957), Bahubali has definitely taken Telugu cinema to new heights
 "in filmon ne kshetreey cinema kii simaaon or bollywood kii superstar vaali samskruti ko tod diya he
 The grandeur, the sheer theatricality and the amazing action have once again drawn the audience towards the cinema hall
 box offis india ke sampadak vajeer singh kehete hai, ''film kaa harek drishy aapke andar use bade parade par dekhne kii ichha paidaa karata he
 "despite the second film coming out after a gap of about two years, the filmmakers have maintained an curiosity and curiosity towards Bahubali and for this the story has been introduced in many forms, such as Anand Neelkanthan's book, Graphic India Comics, animated series on Amazon Prime Video, TV series, mobile games and clothes with pictures of Bahubali
 desh ke 6,500 screens par ek saath relies hone ja rahi bahubalih da canaklujan ko lekar bahut oonchi ummiden lagaai ja rahi hai
 Says Kapoor, "I would be very happy if this film breaks the earlier records, because it shows that the film industry is progressing

 The Delhi government has suffered a major setback regarding nursery admission
 hoicourt ne is maamle main dilli sarkaar kii apil khaarij kar di he
 The double bench of the Delhi High Court has upheld the order of single bench in this case
 dilli sarkaar ne hoicourt ke aadesh ko supreme court main chunauti dene kaa nirnay liya he
 Stay will also remain on 7 January notification related to nursery admission of Delhi Government
 iskaa matlab yah he ki is saal nevarhood criteria ke aadhaar par nursery main admician nahin hoga
 This order of the High Court is a big relief for private schools built on DDA Land
 iske pehle gat 16 farvari ko dilli hoicourt kii single bench ne nursery par bada faisla sunaate hue dilli sarkaar ke 7 janvari ke notification par ste laga diya tha
 Apart from this, the court also revoked the government's Neverhood Criteria
 hycourt ne kaha tha ki sarkaar kaa notification parents se unke apni pasand ke skool main daakhila kaa adhikaron chin rahaa tha, lihaaja ise radd kiya jaataa he
 The High Court had said that in the name of qualifications, the government cannot arbitrate with private schools
 hai court ke is faisle se is saal nursery admician ko lekar rasta saaf ho gaya he
 The skepticism created after the government's notification is over
 privet skulon ne dilli sarkaar kii nursery main daakhile ke liye alji kenotificationako hycourt me chunauti di thi
 In the notification, the government had asked private schools to implement Neighborhood Criteria to enroll in school nurseries built on DDA land
 is notification se dilli ke 298 nijee skool prabhavit ho rahe the
 The Action Committee of the schools said that their interests should not be harmed and the government should not discriminate between students
 bachche ke mata pita ke paas ye adhikaar hona chahie ki wo apane bachche ko kis skool main padhaaen
 Sky plan in Chhattisgarh is under question
 votaron ko khush karne ke liye chhattisgarh sarkaar lagbhag ek hajaar karod kii laagat se mobile tower lagane ja rahi thi
 Not only this, the BJP government of the state would also distribute free smart phones to more than 55 lakh people
 lekin vipaksh ke is mudde par hangaame ke baad sarkaar ko ab you-turn lenaa padaa he
 However, the mobile network will be operated by a private company
 is yojana kaa sidhaa phayda nijee company ko hi hoga
 Villagers will only have the facility to make free calls
 is ajibo-garib yojana ko lekar congress samet kai virdohi dal bijepi par apvyay kaa aarope laga rahe he
 According to him, this is a bad use of government money
 logon ke virodh ke chalate apni is manshaa par saamaanya tabdili karte hue chhattisgarh sarkaar ne ski yojana ke tahat panchayaton kii rakam se mobile tower lagane kii yojana main you turn le liya he
 The state KBJP government has pledged to give smart phones in every village for free
 vidhansabha chunaav ke pehle graminon ke haath main smart phone aa jayega
 Mobile towers are being installed so that they can talk without interruption
 lekin mobile tower lagane kaa kharch panchayaton kii vikaas nidhi se vyay kiye jane kaa faisla liya gaya tha
 Under this scheme, funds were to be given to private companies to install mobile towers in all panchayats
 iskaa pradesh bhar main virodh shuru ho gaya
 The Congress has accused the government of corruption
 congress ne kaha ki mobile tower panchayaton ke kharch par lagenge, lekin phayda mobile network muhaiyaa karaane vaali companiyon ko hoga
 Because the government has not made any settlement of the rent of the mobile tower
 jabaki tower nirmaan kaa kharch panchayatein uthaaengi
 After this, many panchayats have started to surround the government in this matter
 aakhirkar panchayatakarmiyon se mulaakaat ke baad mukhyamantri raman singh ne apana faisla waapas lene kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 He said that now the state government will bear the expenses of the mobile tower construction itself
 unhone kaha ki rajya sarkaar is sambandh main apana pichhlaa aadesh ek do din main waapas le legi
 In Chhattisgarh, the BJP government of the state will provide 55 lakh smart mobile phones for free in the first batch
 sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki isse rajya main sanchaar kranti aegi
 The government is going to spend about one thousand crores in this scheme
 bijepi kii yah yojana rajnatik takaaje par kasi ja rahi he
 It is believed that the BJP government in the state is going to get a big vote bank by distributing free mobile phones
 isi saal rajya main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 In view of this, the government tried to please a large population by giving them mobiles
 lekin congress ne sarkaar kii manshaa par hi pani pherane kaa kaam kiya
 The Congress has created a big fight against the BJP across the state over the amount of panchayats
 congress ne daleel di ki panchayaton kii rakam gaanv ke mulbhoot vikaas ke liye he
 From this, basic facilities like roads, electricity, water, health should be mobilized, not in making it a mobile tower
 ye mudda bijepi par baari padaa
 The pro-bjp panchayats also took a stand against the government over this decision
 panchayaton ke virodh ke chalate aakhirkar mukhyamantri raman singh sarkaar ko you turn lenaa padaa
 The BJP government succumbed to its opponents in the initial phase of the assembly session
 sarkaar ke achaanak you turn lene se virodhiyon ke swar buland hue hai

 The Kejriwal family lived in a colony of employees of the Jindal Strips on the outskirts of Hisar

 Till the year 2000, when the technology did not catch up in the country, such games were popular among middle class children of India
 kusum goyal ne india today ko bataaya, ‘‘arvind na to aaj ke kuch bacchon kii tarah bahut shant tha or na hi hyper active

 George says that even when everyone else was busy finding jobs abroad and making a career, Kejriwal always talked of doing something that could bring about change in India
 dost daawa karte hai ki shuruyaat main kejariwal par vishwanath pratap singh kaa kaaphi gaharaa prabhaav padaa
 His honesty in the Bofors scandal as defense minister and his efforts for social justice to implement reservations based on the report of the Mandal Commission as Prime Minister inspired young Kejriwal
 jorge lobo ne bataaya ki kejariwal ne ram mandir andolan ke liye bijepi kaa kadaa virodh kiya tha
 This movement culminated in the 1992 demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya
 lobo sawaal karte hai, ‘‘vah ek medhaavi chaatr tha

 Kejriwal says, "our expectations rose when the Right to Information (RTI) Act came

 When Kejriwal went to Jodhpur with his cousin Kusum and her husband Kailash eight years ago, the conversation turned to their children
 kusum ne kaha ki ve apane putr or putree ke bhavishya ko lekar chintit rahati hai, jinaki umr pulakit or harshitha se thodi adhik he
 Kejriwal told him, "what will happen to the country if you and i start worrying about our children?" Perhaps this sentiment has brought Kejriwal to where he is today: the leader of a possible political rebellion

 The impact of global warming will not be as much as was feared
 bhala ho bharat or china kathor prabhaavshaalee jalwaayu nitiyon kaa, jisase yah mumkin ho sakaa he
 At the same time, the threat to the environment was raised after US President Donald Trump took steps to reduce global warming
 ek nae adhyayan ke mutabik ab global warming kaa khatra utana gambhir nahin hoga, jitna pehle anumaan lagaaya gaya tha
 However, it is not the case that the environment will improve a lot
 dharti kaa ausat taapmaana 2015 ke paris samjhaute ke limit se zyada tej gati se badhata rahegaa
 The purpose of the 2015 Paris Agreement was to reduce global warming to 2 ° c (3
 6 farenheit) neeche laana he
 According to the report of three independent research groups of Europe, carbonaction Tracker (CAT), Earth 3 to 22nd century
 4 degree celsius (6
 1 F) will be hotter
 haalanki pehle anumaan 3
 6 ° c (6
 5 farenheit) kaa laga tha
 This is the first time since cat's research started in 2009, when the temperature estimates had dropped at the end of the century
 bharat main koyale ke vyapak istemaal ko kam karne ke prayaas kiye ja rahe hai, jisase carbon utsarjan kam ho
 Under the Paris Agreement, China is trying to fulfill its commitments
 iske tahat vah 2030 tak carbon utsarjan kaaphi hadatak gata degaa

 Research group member Bill Hare said that you can see who the leader is
 jahaan trump ne kadam peeche kiye to china or bharat ne kadam aage badaye
 Hare said it is too early to say that global emissions are increasing
 unhone kaha, 'china or bharat ke utsarjan kii raftaar dhimi hui he lekin yah ab bhi utsarjan zyada he
 Especially in India
 vaishvik utsarjan par ankush lagane ke liye sabase bada kadam yah hoga ki kai deshon menkol plantspuri tarah se band kiye jaaen
 Another report said that carbon dioxide emissions could increase by 2 percent in 2017
 isamen china se utsarjan sabase zyada 3
 Will be 5 percent
 vahiin aapako bataa den ki trump ko nahin lagata he ki climet change main maid greenhouse gas ke utsarjan se ho rahaa he
 This is the reason why in June, he said that instead he would focus on increasing employment in the US fossil fuels sector

 com / bwabvlijac haal hi main desh ke jane maane resler da great khali ne ek cement company kii aid kii he
 His ad is becoming very viral on social media
 darasal is aid menkhaliko kaabhi taqatvar dikhaaya gaya he ki unke kisi divaar se takaraa jane bhar se puri divaar tut jaati he yahaan tak kii unka vajan jis bhi cheez par padataa vah mitti main tabadil ho jaati he
 But only the walls or houses made of Ambuja Cement can cope with their heavy body
 aid menkhlike is andaaj ko darshak behad pasand kar rahe hai
 More than 8 lakh people have watched the video of this ad so far
 isse pehle bheekhlikai vigyaapan kar chuke hai lekin unka letest vigyaapan khub pasand kiya ja rahaa he
 See the great Khali's funny ad: kya aap kisi aise bachche kii kalpana kar sakate hai, jo kabhi rota hi naa ho
 You must be wondering whether there can be a child who never cries
 ji haa, ham aapako ek aise bachche ke bare main bataa rahe hai, janm se ab tak kabhi nahin royaa
 Even after the injury or after hearing the scolding of the mother-father, he does not cry
 is bachche kaa naam dextor kahil he or wo isi shanivaar ko 4 saal kaa ho jayega
 Just as this thing surprised you, Dexter Cahill's parents were also surprised
 had to tab ho gai, jab dextor kii taang tut gai or use dard kaa ehsaas tak nahin hua
 Actually, Dexter has a genetic disorder, due to which he does not feel pain
 pair tuutane par bhi dextor ko is baat kaa andaja nahin hua ki uski taang tut gai he
 Similarly, in dance class, the teacher was teaching dance to the children and Dexter jumped in extreme enthusiasm and broke his shin
 dextor khadaa nahin ho paa rahaa tha, lekin itnaa hone par bhi uske aankh se aansu nahin niklaa or na hi dard se uski cheekh nikali
 Dexter's teacher was also surprised by this
 teacher ne dextor kii maa ko phone kiya or usko aspataal le jaaya gaya
 Scientists say that Dexter is the victim of a particular type of disorder
 ise heridetary sensori autonomi neuropathy tip 4 kehete hai
 This disorder occurs in one in 125 million people
 yah rer dysorder he
 The person does not experience pain in this disorder
 yah kai baar khatarnaak bhi sabit ho sakati he
 According to scientists, pain is not detected in this disorder, so if anything is happening internally in the body, it becomes difficult to detect it
 dextor ke mata-pita use chot se bachaane ke liye koi aisa ghar lene vaale hai, jo khulaa-khulaa ho

 The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) has gifted Holi to those who invest in the stock market
 bisai ne retail inwestors ko badhaava dene ke liye share kharidne kii khatir lagane valetranjaction chargeko khatm kar diya he
 Now investors will not have to pay any transaction fee to buy the stock of 30 companies of BSE
 nayaa niyam 12 march se lagu hoga
 BSE has taken this step to increase the participation of Nerital Investors
 philhal yahaan group e, bi or anya gaiyr vishisht sheyaron par pratibhutiyon ke saundon par shulk lagata he
 This fee ranges from 50 paise to one and a half rupees per deal
 bisai ne ek bayaan jari kar kaha ki esendpy bisai sensex 30 ke sheyaron se 12 march se lenden shulk hataaya jayega
 It has hoped that this will make BSE the preferred exchange for transactions in Sensex 30 shares
 kharidari ke aadhaar par tay hota he shulkabisai ke sadasyon ko prati maah ek shulk dena hota he
 Transactions up to Rs 1 lakh require a transaction fee of Rs 1
5 per transaction
 iske alaava ek lakh se teen lakh tak ke len-dein par sava rupee prati saude ke hisaab se shulk dena hota he
 At the same time, on a deal of three lakh to 5 lakh rupees, this fee becomes one rupee per deal
 vahiin, 5 lakh se 20 lakh rupee par 75 paise prati sauda lagata he
 If you are doing more than 20 lakh rupees deal, then you have to pay 50 paise per deal
 bataa den ki is saal cabajet main jetali long turm capital gains tex lagaaya he
 Because of this, investors were unhappy
 haalanki bisai ne len-dein shulk khatm kar fori raahat dene kii koshish jarur kii he
 According to the BSE, the transaction fee is charged per trade
 udhaaharan ke liye agar ek niveshak ke maheene ke ant tak total 25 lakh trade hai, to is par use prati trade 0
 a fee of 50 paise is to be paid
 kyonki yah 20 lakh rupee se zyada he
 In such a situation, when you calculate the transaction fee, it will be 25,00,000 * 0
 5 hoga
 In this way, this fee becomes 12 lakh 50 thousand rupees

 'climb Modi's chest, seal will be on elephant'
 
 
 ye vivaadit naaraa sunai diya muradabad se bispi ke loksabhaa ummidavaar haji yaqub kuraishi ke jansampark ke dauraan
 Cases of violation of the Code of Conduct are constantly coming forward, despite Haji Yakub's rhetoric
 isse pehle yaqub narendra modi ko 'darinda' kah chuke hai
 From the stage of a street corner in Moradabad, Yakub Qureshi used to tell the people that if he was made MP, then every person would be Haji Yakub, everyone would be MP and every Muslim child would open the button
 yaqub ne kaha ki unhone kai gundon ko thik kiya he or kai bhrashtachariyon adhikariyon ko 'dekha' he
 BSP candidate Haji Yakub Qureshi said, 'become Haji Yakub himself, because Inshallah, after becoming MP, every single person of my Moradabad will be MP, Haji will be Yakub
 aap batan kholkar chaloge
 Every Muslim's child will open the button, i promise to go
 'iske baad bhi yaqub kuraishi manch se bhadakaau bhaashan dene se nahin chuke
 Attacking Narendra Modi, he termed the Gujarat riot case as Taliban and brutal act, saying that the way the blood of people was shed, burnt and burnt in Gujarat, this election is a warning for Muslims
 yaqub kuraishi ne mujffarnagar dange ke liye akhilesh sarkaar or bijepi ko doshi tehraaya
 Qureshi said, 'this election is a warning to the Bharatiya Janata Party and especially to the Muslims
 chunaav main raajnneeti to sab karte hai, lekin yah bahut gambheer chunaav he
 There have been 141 riots in UP in the past two and a half years
 bijepi or sapa ne aapas main gathbandhan karke mujffarnagar main danga karaayaa
 Thousands of people lost their lives
 lakhon log beghar ho gaye
 Akhilesh Sarkar said that we will set up commission, get the inquiry done
 samaajawaadee party kaa koi netaa aakar kah de ki mujffarnagar dange main hamane 10 aadmi bhi jail bheje hai
 If ten men had also been sent to jail, the Muslims would have been relieved
 'baharhaal, sabase bada sawaal to yah he ki aakhir yaqub kuraishi muradabad loksabhaa chunaav ko kis tarah kaa rang dena chaah rahe hai? Eventually the Madhepura District Magistrate had to withdraw his Tughlaqi Faman released a day earlier

 Sohail hurriedly called a meeting of cyber experts, active members of social media, media persons and intellectuals and decided to withdraw the order issued by him

 Sohail had a meeting with the group administrator of social media
 ghanto chali is baithak main vichaar vimarsh ke baad pehle to jiladhikari dwaara jari aadesh ko khandit karne kaa nirnay liya gaya
 Then this responsibility was fixed on all the group administrators that if any kind of false rumor is spread from the group, then the responsibility will be the responsibility of the type admin
 baithak main ye tay kiya gaya ki group admin is baat par najar chhakhenge ki uske group se kisi bhi tarah kii afvaah na failaayi jaae
 In this meeting chaired by the District Magistrate, everyone agreed unanimously that if there is any kind of rumor spreading message in any group, then they should immediately take a screenshot of that message and send it to the district administration's number 9955948775
 kisi ke group main agar afvaah failaane vaala koi massej aata he or group admin uski jaankaree jila prashasan dwaara jari nambar par nahin detaa he to or jila prashasan ko kisi duusare madhyam se is baat kii jaankaree ho jaati he to group admin par prashasnic karrwai kii jaaegi
 Madhepura District Magistrate sohail ne watsape or fasebuk ke liye jari kiye gaye apane aadesh ko nirast karte hue saamaajik hit ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sabaki sahmati se ek nayaa disha nirdesh jari kiya
 The key decision taken in the meeting is that the group administrators of whatsapp and Facebook will have the responsibility that if someone puts a rumor-ridden post in a group that hurts ethnic, religious, social sentiments, then their information is immediate
 The number of the District Cybercrime Cell will have to be given on 9955948775
 prashasan ko soochna dene vaale vyakti kaa naam gupt rakhega
 It was decided in the meeting that if a group administrator does not do this and if it is found after investigation, then action will be taken as per rules
 madhepura main aise jis jila sibar krime cell kaa gathan kiya gaya he wo sadaiv karyrat rahegaa or is sandarbh main monettering karti rahegi
 It may be noted that after the communal tension that spread after Dussehra and Muharram at Bihariganj in Madhepura district of Bihar, the Madhepura District Magistrate issued a Tughlaqi decree, with which he started to suffer a lot
 madhepura ke jiladhikari dwaara jari aadesh main kaha gaya tha ki madhepura ke ilaakon watsape chalaane vaale jitne bhi group hai usamen jila prashasan dwari jari ek mobile nambar 9955948775 ko bhi shaamil kiya jaae, aisa nahin karne par group ke admin par kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 However, in order to partially improve their order in DM, those who run the family group were kept away from it

 For the first time, the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) has taken steps towards taking up the projects themselves
 rera (RERA) ne kadaa faisla lete hue 7 projects ko deregister karne ke liye kaaran bataao notice jari kiye hai
 Now on receiving the response from the developers, RERA will decide to deregister these projects
 in 7 projects main shaamil greater noida ke primroj infratech kaa project primroj rin, pisie impex sampada livia, emesa develper kaa circuit hits green be infrastracchar ke green be golf homes or golf village shaamil hai
 The three phases of Mist Direct Sales Pvt Ltd's Project Festival City, the five phases of Unnati Fortune's Project Aranya and the three phases of Intelligence Project are included in this derivative list
 agar ye projects deregister hote hai to phir inhen puraa karne ke liye rera 3 vikalpon ko aajamaayega
 The first option is to bring a co-developer responsible for completing these projects, in such a case, the co-developer will complete the remaining project with the outstanding amount from the home buyers and pay the land to the respective development authority
 haalanki isamen ek mushkil ye ho sakati he ki agar kaam puraa karne ke liye zyada rakam kii zarurat hogi or ghar kharidaaron se kam rakam kii vasuuli ho paaegi to ghar kharidaaron se atirikt rakam bharne ko kaha ja saktaa he
 If the home buyer does not agree to it, then he can go to court and the project may get stuck again
 iske saath hi rera pehle builder se ghar kharidaaron kii rakam vasuulne ke liye dabaav bana saktaa he
 Another way could be to ask home buyers to complete the project on their own
 ghar kharidaar apni ek association banaakar project puraa karne kaa kaam shuru kar sakate hai, lekin iske liye ghar kharidaaron ke ek bade varg kii rajamandi zaruri hogi
 Earlier in October, Rera gave this opportunity to the home buyers of a project of the Shubhna Group, but so far the home buyers have not decided on it
 teesraa tarika ho saktaa he ki project kii jameen cancil karke athurity nae sire se nae kharidaar ko de
 In this case, home buyers can get a refund in case the new allotment is at an expensive rate or they can join the new developer under new conditions
 haalanki, ye teenon hi vikalp project kii haalat ko dekhakar hi aajamaae jate hai
 The option to cancel can apply only where nominal work has been done
 jaruri nahin ki har baar aap kisi ko bataaen tabhi saamne vaale ko ye pataa chale ki aapaki lav-life kisi he

 devendra fadanvis apane teen saal ke kaarykaal main bataur mukhyamantri maharashtra main sabase bade raajnneetik sankat kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 There is no hope of relief in the coming days for the Fadnavis trapped in the aggression of militant Dalit movements and upper cast right wing Hindutva
 times of india kii khabar ke mutabik maharashtra ke hriday main jo aag dadhak rahi he, wo fadanvis kii mushkilen badhaane vaali he
 The Maratha Federation is set to resume its agitation on reservation from next month

 Due to this, there is a boil in Dalit organizations
 duusari ore bijepi ke andruni sutron kaa maananaa he ki sharad pavaar kii party ensipi devendra fadanvis ke liye mushkilen khadi kar rahi he
 It is also easy for the NCP because the Fadnavis come from the Brahmin community

 However, the Dalit organization does not agree with the BJP

 All these areas are strongholds of parties like BJP, Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP
 doosraa ye ki rajya main jis tarah se jaateey hinsa kii ghatnaayen badi hai, usase bijepi ke maathe par chintaa kii lakeeren hai
 Ethnic violence has been perceived as a rural issue in a way, but Wednesday's Maharashtra bandh has held Mumbai for hours
 khabaron ke mutabikbijeypi adhyaksh amit shahpure maamle par nigaah rakhe hue hai
 It is believed that the party high command directed Devendra Fadnavis that the entire matter should be dealt with peacefully
 yahi vajah he ki mumbai police ne dalit pradarshnakariyon par kadi karrwai nahin kii
 The effort of the state government was that the outrage of the Dalit should come out on the road

 Farmers from Sabarkantha Bipin Patel, Chhabil Patel, Vinod Patel and Haribhai Patel have sought time to present their case in the court, after which the court has now posted the next hearing on June 12

 Hunger deaths continue in Jharkhand
 simdega or dhanbad ke baad is baar devgarh ke mohanpur ilaake ke bhagavanpur gaanv main ek shaks kii maut kii khabar he
 However, Food Supply Minister Saryu Rai of Jharkhand said that the death in Deoghar has nothing to do with hunger
 sarayu raay ke mutabik vibhaag kii chaar sadasyon kii team ne devgarh main jaakar padtaal kii, jisamen yah paaya gaya ki ye ek swaabhaavik maut he
 However, while giving his clarification on the lack of ration cards for many people, he said that this is a continuous process and i have sought information from the department in this matter
 sarayu raay ne kaha, 'hamane logon se kaha he ki vah vibhaag se shikaayat karen
 Those who do not get ration, will give full compensation according to the market rate
 is maamle main mantralay bilkul open he, agar koimautahoti he to usko sidhe bhukh se jod dena thik nahin he
 According to Saryu Rai, if we do not talk about Simdega, then there is no death due to lack of food grains in Jharia and Deoghar
 unke mutabik aisa nahin he ki kareeb 11 lakh logon ke rashan card radd kar die gaye, balki saadhe nau lakh card nae banawaye gaye
 The Right to Food Act in Jharkhand is working properly
 unhone mana ki rajya main kuposhan he, is vajah se kai sari yojanaon ko ab ek hi chat ke neeche laana chahie
 This is also the purpose of the ministry
 sarayu raay ne kaha ki unhone peedies ke dukandaaron ko ek extra pahchaan patr registerd rakhane karne ko kaha he
 The Government of India has a guideline that anyone can take food grains from an identity card
 mantralay jaldi online rashan card banayega
 He admitted that there is a shortage of man Pawar with the department, we have 400 vacancies
 sarayu raay ke mutabik aisi maut to hoti rahegi isko koi roak nahin saktaa lekin yah jaanch kaa vishay he ki koun bhukh se mar rahe hai ? darasal bhukh se maut kii baat 2 din ke baad aati he
 Because of this it is a dilemma whether starving or some other reason
 sarayu ne kaha ki simdega main 11 saal kii santoshi kii maut kaa maamla bhukh se maut kii ghatana kaa vishay ho saktaa he, jharia main 40 saal ke rickshaw chaalak baijnath ke paas rashan card nahin tha lekin devgarh main rupalal ke parivaar waalon ne beete maheene rashan banwaaya tha

 Crimes have been occurring in delhi-ncr
 lekin pichley kuch dinon se kshetra main samuhik katl or khudakushi ke jis teji se maamle bade hai usne har kisi ko is nae khaufnak trend ko lekar chintaa main daal diya he
 In the last 15 days, 3 families ended up one by one
 kisi main pita akelaa rah gaya or kisi main to koi namelewa hi nahin rahaa
 The question is, what has happened to delhi-ncr? Why are people thirsty for the blood of their own family and their loved ones? After all, how can anyone think of such mass murder and suicide? a fresh incident of this whole incident took place in the Mussoorie area of ghaziabad, where 3 girls and parents of the same family died
 ye maamla in teenon samuhik katl or khudakushi ke maamalon main shaayad sabase ajeeb or chaunkaanewaala bhi he
 There was chaos in the New Shatabdiapuram Colony of Mussoorie on Friday morning when people got the news of the killing of 5 people from one family
 aanan-fanan main police bhi mauka-e-vaardaat par pahunchi
 The door of the room was locked from inside, so the police had to break the door
 ek parivaar, 5 mautein or kaali tepe kii paheliandar kaa manjar itnaa bhayanak tha ki pehali najar main to pulisavaalon ke bhi hosh ud gaye
 The body of 3 daughters, fathers of 3, 5 and 8, and father was lying on one bed in the room, while the mother of blood-soaked girls was still meditating on the same bed
 mahila ko fouran aspataal bhijwaya gaya, jisaki baad main maut ho gai
 The chance-e-incident involved a hammer, targeting the woman
 vaise to teenon bacchiyon ke munh par bhi ek kaala tepe laga tha, lekin bacchiyon ke pita kii naak or munh par kuch zyada hi tepe lipta hua tha or dekh kar lagata tha ki maa ko chhodkar shaayad sabhi kii maut tepe lapetakar saans ghutane kii vajah se hui
 By the way, this method of suicide is very strange and shocking in itself, because the act of committing suicide by sticking tape on one's own mouth is usually not heard
 lekin chunki yahaan cameraa andar se band tha or padosiyon ne bhi kisi ko aate-jate hue nahin dekha, isliye police ko shaq he ki apni bacchiyon or bivi kaa katl karne ke baad is shaks ne bhi apane munh par tepe chipka kar khudakushi kar lee
 Mass murder on suspicion! According to the police, 42-year-old Pradeep was living here for the last several years with his wife Sangeeta (40) and 3 daughters Manasvi (8), Yashasvi (5) and Ojasvi (3)
 pradeep aksar sharaab peetaa tha or uskaa diediction centre main ilaaj bhi chal rahaa tha
 He was also suspicious of his wife's behavior
 aise main lagata he ki usee ne puure parivaar ko khatm kar jaan de di
 Ghaziabad SSP Sudhir Kumar Singh said, 'we have got a suicide note written by Pradeep by chance, in which he has written about suicide while expressing doubt on the behavior of his wife
 haalanki abhi ham puure maamle kii jaanch kar rahe hai
 'separating the death of 5 people in the same family is a shocking thing
 It is also a shocking thing that in these painful incidents of elimination of the whole family, different reasons have been revealed in every case so far
 gajiabad kii is vaardaat main jahaan ab tak bivi ke chaal-chalan par shaq ke chalate puure parivaar ke khatme kii kahani saamne ai he
 In Mehrauli, in the case of one tuition teacher's entire family, his wife's illness and irritation while his depression became the reason
 udhar, gurugram main ek behad sampann 4 logon ke parivaar ke katl or khudakushi ke maamle main rupee-paison kii kami vajah ban kar saamne ai
 Overall, these cases of mass murder and suicide are undoubtedly the same, but in terms of reasons, these sentences are of different types
 mahrauli main khooni pita kaa khelgaziabad kii is vaardaat main jahaan ab tak bivi ke chaal-chalan par shaq ke chalate puure parivaar ke khatme kii kahani saamne ai he
 On the other hand, in Ward No 2 in Mehrauli, Delhi, in the case of one tuition teacher's entire family, his wife's illness and irritability and depression caused him

 Improving Volunteers: Through a program called Confluent Operations, the RSS will teach its volunteers step-by-step martial arts, poetry, debates and science to increase organizational capacity and academically stronger

 He said, 'the Sangh is trying to identify the best of the youth who agree with its ideology

 He further explained that in the last three years, the number of branches in UP has also seen a steady increase
 jaisaa ki aresas hameshaa se kahata aayaa he ki wo chunaav nahin ladenge
 The Sangh has always described itself as a cultural organization, not a political one
 haalanki sangh apni rajnatik shakha bijepi ko jamini str par kaary karne vaale kaaryakarta uplabdh karaata aayaa he
 BJP will definitely benefit from the way in which RSS branches are continuously increasing in UP

 The special thing about this increase is that through this the Sangh is now targeting the vote bank of BSP Chief Mayawati
 gauratlab he ki sangh ne apni shakhaon ko do bhaagon main baant rakhaa he, vidhyaarthee or vyavsaayee
 Looking at the figures, the branch of students has grown more than the branch of businessmen

 vaise, orissa vidhansabha ne apane 147 vidhayakon ke liye aachaar samhita paarit kii he, par usne saaf kiya he ki sirf ek vidhayak ne is par amal kiya

 Since last September, revised traffic rules have been implemented in the country
 nae trephic rules ke tahat jurmaane kii raashi main pehle kii apeksha kai guna badhotaree bhi kar di gai he
 After the implementation of the new traffic rules, the traffic police and local police started taking action against those who broke the traffic rules
 iske saath hi uttar pradesh main yogi sarkaar ne yah farmaan jari kar diya ki yatayaat niyamon kii dhajjiyaan udaane vaale pulicekarmiyon par doguna jurmaana vasula jayega
 In view of this, the team of 'aaj Tak' did a reality check in different parts of UP whether those people are also following the traffic rules, who have the responsibility to follow the traffic rules? First came out in the city of Varanasi and captured the pictures in his camera in which only the police personnel were seen flogging the traffic rules
 bagaiyr helmet apane ek saathi ko bithakar jaise hi ek pulicekarmi aage badhane vaala tha, vaise hi camera dekh uski citti pitti gum ho gai
 Asked why he should not wear the helmet, the policeman replied, "I have just arrived immediately and the fellow is bringing the helmet
" bike kaa paper or diel poochne par ve dikhaate rah gaye or fansy number plate ko bhi jald sahi kara lene kaa vaada kar chalate bane
 Aajtak's camera captured two more similar photographs in Varanasi in which policemen appeared to be in violation of traffic rules and made excuses on asking
 varanasi ke baad 'ajtak' kii team sangam nagari prayagraj pahunchi
 Here too many policemen were seen flaunting traffic rules
 bina helmet pahane bike savaar pulicekarmiyon ko jab 'ajtak' kii team ne pakadaa to dekh kar hadabada gaye or bike ke peeche baithe sipaahi ne bike chalaa rahe sipaahi ke haathon main helmet pakadaa diya
 When asked about this, he ran away without answering
 vahi bina helmet pahane duusare bike savaar pulicekarmi se jab trephic niyam follow karne or helmet na pahanane kii vajah poochi gai to unhone hemelet tut jane kaa bahaanaa banaaya
 The same situation was there in the industrial city of Kanpur
 yahaan bhi 'ajtak' ke camere main aise kai pulicekarmi pakade gaye jo trephic niyamon kaa ulanghan karte hue dikhaai die
 Many policemen were found here who neither wore helmets nor seat belts in vehicles

 Criticizing the Congress for holding Narendra Modi responsible for the Assam violence, the Shiv Sena today said that such allegations are being made by those who have 'divided the country'

 The oldest BJP ally also targeted Congress leader Kapil Sibal, saying that 'the way he raised the issue of Bangladeshi Muslims in Assam, he was never seen raising the issue of Hindus in Kashmir

 Instead of abusing Modi, Congressmen should be complacent
 shivasena ne kaha, is tarah ke aarope lagane waalon ko yaa to ramdev ke ashram main vipasana (yoga) karnaa chahie yaa phir 16 may ko chunavi nateezon ke baad unhen manorog aspataal main bhartee ho janaa chahie, kyonki ve log apana dimagi santulan kho baithe hai
 It is notable that the Congress attacked the BJP for violence in Assam and its candidate for the post of Prime Minister, saying that it was a result of 'communal polarization' done by them to garner votes

 Even though he has been accused of not doing anything - but there is a break in whatever he was doing or was doing
 ab wo puri tarah tarotaaja hai
 Obviously the challenges are also new, but what about that? They have to perform in any case
 aisa bhi nahin he ki chunautiyaan sirf unheen ke saamne hai
 Even before them, many people made their own different strategy on meeting the challenges, implemented it and succeeded

 It is being told that some members are very angry with the decision of the party's alliance with the Congress in Bengal, due to which the meeting is expected to be very loud
 vidhansabha chunaav ke baad paulitte beuro kii yah pehali baithak he
 The meeting will mainly focus on the party's desperate defeat in Bengal
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki bengal main congress ke saath party ke gathbandhan ke faisale se kuch sadsy kaafii naaraaz hai jisaki vajah se aaj kii baithak main gahamagahami rahane kii ummid he
 a Question
 is daur kii siyasat ko samajhane ke liye aap kise chunengeh choudhary virendra singh ko, jo congress party ke mahasachiv or dilli, uttarakhand or himachal pradesh ke prabharee hai, yaa phir mughal samrajya kaa suraj doobane ke dauraan urdu-farsi ke shaayar-falsophi mirza asadulla khan nnagalib ko? sawaal atapata he, or chunaav bhi ajeeb
 If you choose Chaudhary, then your decision is appropriate
 ye baat alag he ki tanavbhre vajood ke is daur main mirza kahin zyada madadgaar ho sakate hai
 how? Let us look at the evidence
 congress ne 17 april ko dilli nagar nigam chunaav harkar apane patan kii tasdik kar di
 The same day, Chaudhary Virender Singh made an airing on TV that the mistake was actually by the voter; The voter did not know what he was doing
 koi dedh sau saal pehle gaalib ke jamaane main chunaav nahin hote the, or agar hote bhi to shaayad ve vot na daalate, lekin khayalon kii duniya main jo aaraam miltaa he, usase ve bahut waakif the
 Then he said: We know the reality of paradise but / the idea of making up the heart is good
 choudhary hakeekat ko acchhee tarah jaanate hai, lekin bas ek khyal unke dil kaa boj halkaa kar detaa he
 For the moment, this is a big relief for him
 darasal, siyasat ek vyaavhaarik kala he
 There is a punishment for confusion
 yahaan khud ko bahalane or sajaa dene ke bich badi maheen rekha hoti he
 If any politician believes that the reason for his defeat is the fault of the voter, then understand, the ground has slipped from under his feet
 koi bhi chunaav chota nahin hota, kyonki voter hameshaa ahm hota he phir chaahe vah badi sarkaar chun rahaa ho yaa choti
 After Mrs
 Gandhi's terrible defeat in 1977, the first moment of changing the mood of the country came from the local elections held in North India in which the Congress won
 janata party ke unke virodhiyon ne ise yah kah kar hawa main uda diya ki ye to chehre par ek daag bhar he
 They forgot that a single scar often gives the diagnosis of internal cancer
 dilli ke nagar nigam chunaav or uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav ke bich ek hi rishta he ki logon kaa asantosh ab tufaan ban chukaa he
 Its root is in the double risk of poor governance and political mismanagement
 yah congress ko satta kii us masanad se utaar phenkane ko taiyaar he jahaan use hameshaa se hi sukun miltaa rahaa he
 Excuses did not go in Uttar Pradesh, they would not work in Delhi
 uttar pradesh main is baat kaa kaaphi prachaar kiya gaya ki vahaan party sanghathan namaujood tha
 This organization was also largely in 2009 when the Congress came to the Lok Sabha elections with 21 seats
 yah network 2012 tak dhah to gaya nahin hoga
 Since Rahul Gandhi did the work of pouring manure and water in this land continuously for three years, but in these three years, the vote of Congress came down by more than six percent
 party ke bheetar ghamaasan much gaya kyonki uske vishwaas kii jameen darak chuki thi
 If you are in power, the voter examines your claims only through your performance
 rahul gandhi ne uttar pradesh main chunaav prachaar par akele kabja jamaa liya
 The one who was worshiped on the victory of the Congress should be held responsible for the loss, but the blame is not theirs alone
 bhrashtachar ke daldal main tairte or vaadon kii khokhli asthiyon par jubaani jamaa kharch ke phool chadhaate upie gathbandhan ne rahul gandhi ko apahiz bana diya tha
 Since he was the only one who accepted the face of the Congress in Uttar Pradesh, the slap was on his cheek
 agar ve prachaar main nahin hote, to bhi congress ko aise hi nattejey milte
 It is not that Rahul Gandhi's arrival did not make a difference, rather it was that he could not make a difference
 or ek aisa sanghathan jo khandaani khun se chalata he, uske liye yah sweekaarokti badi khatarnaak he
 Therefore, Congress needs excuses
 bahaanon-khayalon kii ek or vajah he
 Existence is not just a physical matter, it also requires an SEZ of thoughts
 karibadhi kendriya cabinet jahaan satta kii lottery jite ek shaks kii sthaayee muskaan par tiki he, vahiin umr ke 40wein or 50wein dashak main chal rahe rajyamantriyon kaa vajood dhire-dhire avsaad or bechaini kaa shikaar hota ja rahaa he
 Most of them have been stuck there for eight years without any progress
 inke liye yah khyal ek jangal main gum ho jane jaisaa bura he kyonki 2009 main ye maan baithe the ki 20 saal tak raaj karne kaa license mil gaya
 If their moral strength is missed before the next general election, then the casualties in the war are bound to increase
 jaahir he, unhen yah bharosa dilaae jane kii jarurat thi ki asal dikkat halaat kii he, netritv kii nahin; halaat vakt ke saath badal jaaenge, lekin netritv nahin badal saktaa
 Victory produces intoxication
 iskaa khumaar bhi hota he
 UPA-2 is still in a state of hangover
 haar sabak sikhaati he, lekin uske liye eemaandaar hona padataa he
 It may be in the election stampede on TV that Chaudhary should take care of the wounds of defeat for some time
 lekin lambii daud main to chachaa nnagalib kii hi baton par yakeen karnaa hoga
 There is a similar relationship between the Municipal Corporation elections of Delhi and the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, that people's discontent has become a storm
 isaki jad kharaab prashasan or rajnatik kuprabandhan ke dohare sankat main he
 It is ready to throw the Congress away from the state of power where it has always been relaxed
 aap dharm ke bataae raste par chalanaa chaahate hai lekin yah nahin jaanate ki dharm ke mutabik kya sahi he or kya galat, to aap kya karenge? vahi kiijie jo 33 varshiya farjaana khan ne kiya
 She wanted to know whether she had the right to get back what she spent on her husband? Instead of going to the city's Mufti, he took the help of the Fatwa online website on the Internet and the answer was present in the next twenty four hours
 faraj khan ne bhi islamweb naamak site ke jariye janaa ki pariksha main nakal karnaa galat he
 "then i never did cheating," says Faraz
 yah sawaal shahar ke mufti se karne main sankoch bhi hota or shaayad sawaal unhen betuka bhi lagata
 It is certain that the answer is not available
 ''islam online, ascoimam, onislam, fatwa online or islamweb jaisi dheron website hai jo musalamaanon ko fatwa yaa unke dharm sambandhi sawaalon ke jawaab detii hai
 The specialty of these websites is that most of the fatwas who are fatwa are thousands of km away abroad
 vaise pichley kuch saal se online fatve dene vaali kai bhartiya citen bhi aa gai hai
 Darul Uloom Deoband also has its own fatwa site called Darul Ifta
 fatwa online dilli ke mufti ejaj arshad kaasmi chalaa rahe hai
 About 200 questions are asked on this website every day, which Kasmi and team of 10 people give together
 kaasmi kehete hai, ''internet ke jariye majahab ke bare main jaanane main koi buraai nahin he
 This is an easier and better way
 ''28 saal kii phija jafar yah jaananaa chaahati thim ki islam main ibro banavaane kii ijaajat he yaa nahin
 Fatwa Online told them that it is un-islamic
 is tarah fatwa cites dharm sambandhi jaankaree hi nahin badha rahi hai balki fatvon ke bare main soch badalane main bhi madadgaar sabit ho rahi hai
 As Naib Qazi Syed Babar Hussain Nadvi of Bhopal says, "fatwa is not an order
" balki iskaa matlab he ki aapane sawaal poocha or saamne vaale ne uskaa jawaab diya
 "it is not easy to find out from which of the many Fatwa sites it is right to ask questions
 mufti kaasmi kehete hai, ''aapako yah dekhnaa hoga ki fatwa dene vaale log koun hai
 "for example, ismailonline is viewed by more than a million people every month because it has associated Yusuf Karzawi, the Islamic scholar of Egypt
" fatwa websites kii vajah se logon ko nijee jindagi se jude aise sawaal poochne kii aazaadee bhi mil rahi he jo ve dharmaguru se nahin puch sakate the
 That is, the word 'fatwa' is becoming synonymous with independence

 ' US President Donald Trump has nominated David Malpas, a senior finance ministry official, as the next president of the World Bank
 agar vishwa bank samooh ke nideshak unke paksh main matdaan karte hai to vah vishwa bank ke adhyaksh ke taur par gym yong kim kaa sthaan lenge
 Significantly, the dominance of America is very high in the World Bank, so generally American citizens have been occupying this post

 Considering the vote of different countries in the World Bank, confirmation of Malpas's name is just a formality
 america raashtrapati ne malpas ke namakan kii ghoshnaa karte hue unhen ‘‘vishesh vyakti’’ or aisa vyakti bataaya jo is pad ke liye ekadam yogya he
 Who is David Malpas? Let me tell you that as Additional Secretary of Finance for International Affairs, 62-year-old Malpas oversees the functioning of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank
 antarrashtriya rup se prakhyat arthshaastri malpas ke paas arthshaastra, vitt, sarkaar or videsh niti main 40 saal kaa anubhav he
 Malpas had been Donald Trump's economic advisor during the 2016 election

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi both rallied in UP on Thursday
 piem modi ne apane sansadeey kshetra main varanasi main raily kii or rahul gandhi ke aaropon par jamkar palatwaar kiya to vahiin baharich kii raily main rahul gandhi ne phir piem ko jawaab diya
 These were the main issues on which there was a confrontation between Rahul Gandhi and PM Modi
 baharich main jila mukhyalay ke gend ghar maidan main hone vaali raily ko congress party ne janaakrosh raily naam diya he
 The party says that Rahul Gandhi is constantly fighting against the problems being faced by the public against demonetisation
 baramunda maidan akasar orissa kii rajdhani bhubaneshwar ke dakshin-pashchimi bahari ghere ko jodgaye vaali vyast sadak ke kinare banjar padaa rahata he
 On Tuesday, February 11, this ground was occupied by a Tilism, who promises divinity against the claim of skill
 agle kuch ghanton main yahaan kuch bahut khaas hone vaala he
 The steps leading to the ground of thousands of people revealed all the difference
 raste main banti ja rahi tapiyon, scorf or jhandon ke bich kesaria rang or gaharaa hota ja rahaa he
 They are not the weary villages whom the local leaders have brought to the city for a day after filling them in buses

 When he bounces his one-line jumbo to the audience in 'vijay Sankalp Samabesh' in Bhubaneswar, his enthusiasm cannot be summed up in words
 modi yaa to koi rockstar hai, jo apane prasanshkon ko saath main gane ke liye dhun de rahe hai yaa kisi josh se bharpoor janata kii bheed ko sammohit karne vaale vyakti hai
 Whichever way you look, from Delhi to Thiruvananthapuram and from Mumbai to Guwahati, the city they go to, Modi shows his pride as head of state
 yah abhi nahin kaha ja saktaa ki yah aakarshan vastav main janadesh kaa rup legaa yaa nahin
 There is no doubt that Modi is campaigning, which has never happened in India
 is prachaar kii baarik se baarik baat bahut nipunata se tay kii jaati he
 Leaders, activists, volunteers and professionals work together, playing the tune like a music-loving orchestra playing in front of a crowded crowd every night
 sandesh par chaahe ab bhi bahes ho sakati ho, lekin uski delivery ne ab kala kaa rup le liya he
 Ever since Modi was nominated as the Prime Ministerial candidate by the BJP last September, his core team and the party's machinery, initially hesitant to elevate him, have united for one goal, as if a jack connects to a USB port
 varisht netaaon ke saath unki khinchataan ab nepathy main chali gai he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has handed over its experience, information and organization power of state units to Modi
 pichley paanch maheene main ummidavaar modi ne 78 reliyon ko sambodhit kiya he or 45,339 kilometre kaa faasla tay kiya he
 In the coming two months, his schedule will become more busy

 While his political chief of staff sits in Lucknow as the bjp's election chief for Uttar Pradesh, the party's IT cell in Delhi would provide operational and ground support to leaders in the states from separate war rooms set up in Mumbai, Gandhinagar, Ahmedabad and Delhi
 Who work to make them interact with the ground reality

 Kailashanathan adds
 1979 batch ke iees adhikari kailashnathan pichhali may main ritair hone ke baad se unke mukhya pradhan sachiv hai
 Moving towards the General Election, the candidate Modi has grown larger than the sum of the different parts of the BJP
 tamilnadu main party ke andruni surveykshan bataate hai ki 45 fisadi log modi ko pradhanmantri dekhnaa chaahate hai, jabaki sirf 15 fisadi bijepi ko vot denge
 Hence the propaganda message that votes for the party will go directly to Modi, not the local candidates
 modi ne kai tapiyaan pahan rakhi hai—vikaas purush, chaay vaala, pichde varg kaa ladkaa
 One can choose whichever gender, caste or class
 ve kabhi hindutv ke netaa hai, kabhi badlaav ke agent to kabhi dil se jawan

 In his speeches, care is taken to ensure that different types of listeners are fully connected to the basic emotions
 ve apane shrotaaon ko yaad dilaate hai ki ve ek shandaar viraasat ke uttaradhikari hai
 The vernacular begins with a few lines, then refers to their problems and in a witty tone compares to their position in the comfort life of states like bjp-ruled Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 phir pichley saath saal main centre main congress sarkaron ke kathith nikammepan ko badha-chadhaakar pesh kiya jaataa he
 In this way, an air of jokes are released on the opponents and it is promised that if they get power for just sixty months, then the future will be golden
 phir shrotaaon ko jor-shor se yaad dilaakar bhaashan kii samaapti hoti he ki unhen apane upar garv kyon hona chahie
 He said in Bhubaneswar that i have come from the land of Somnath to the land of Jagannath
 ishaara puri ke jagannatha mandir kii taraf tha
 Modi roared 'jai Jagannath' crowd shouted even more vigorously - 'jai Jagannath'

 Among these, there is also the Yuva ITTV internet channel of BJP

 Each of these seats will be backed by at least 5,000 'modi-fires' or 7,75,000 trained campaigners who will have batches, ID cards and pamphlets
 arvind gupta ke shabdon main sabase badi baat yah he ki ve josh or sankalp se labarej honge
 Modi, popularly known as a chai wala, wholeheartedly supported the discussion on tea; on 13 February, he connected to 1,000 tea shops across the country via audio and telebridge from Gandhinagar
 modi ke bhaashan lekhakon main do darjan shodhakarta shaamil hai, jo pashchimi ahmedabad main ek chote-se kamare main baithte hai
 These include engineers, scholars, iims and NID graduates, who coordinate with other agencies and send facts and local information on papers to Modi so that he can see them during the flight to the next rally venue

 During a four-hour flight, Modi's 69-year-old PRO Jagdish Thakkar collected this information from the vast Assam database
 guwahati main utarane se pehle modi ke paas sab kuch tha
 The main issues of his speech were written in bullet points in Gujarati and supporting facts were in an easily watchable document, which he had to present to about 150,000 people
 baharhaal, assam se pradhananmatri manmohan singh ke rajyasabha main chune jane kaa majaak udaate hue modi ne kaha ki agar pradhanmantri un logon ke liye kuch nahin kar sakate, jinhone unhen sansad main bheja to baaki desh ke liye kya karenge
 Modi's local understanding in Bhubaneswar was revealed when he openly attacked the Naveen Patnaik government, alleging that the Chief Minister was denying the legacy of his late father Biju Patnaik
 biju patnayak kaa naam aaj bhi orissa kii phijaaon main goonjata he
 Modi said, "naveen Babu has been ruling for fourteen years and you are still poor, unemployed and craving for drinking water
 isse sabase zyada koun pareshaan hoga
 "then i stopped and said," Biju Patnaik, wherever he is today, he will be the most sad
 ”ab na hogi chookvaise, aisa pehali baar nahin he jab bijepi ne itnaa bada chunaav prachaar shuru kiya he
 Ten years ago, the bjp-led coalition government campaigning for its second term claimed India Shining (bharat Uday)
 us samay iske netaa kehete the ki bhartiya arthvyavastha ko lekar janata main kaaphi aashaaen hai
 He proudly told how the salaries of the people were increasing rapidly, the growth rate was very high, the stock market was booming and India got the 2010 Commonwealth Games organized
 vah party kaa ati utsaahi chunaav prachaar tha, jisaki kaman tej-tarraar netaa pramod mahajan sambhaal rahe the
 New ways of campaigning were being taken out, such as the recorded phone call of the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, which used to come to a large section of voters
 joardaar jeet kii bhavishyavaaniyon ke baavjood aam chunaav main bijepi ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 The party later admitted that it was a good slogan, but India Shining did ignore some of the realities of India at that time
 kehete hai, doodh kaa jala chacha ko bhi phoonk-foonkkar peetaa he
 Something similar is also with the BJP
 party kaa kahana he ki modi kaa chunaav prachaar takneekee naveenta or sahi lakshya ke nazariye se india shining se kaaphi alag he
 "this is the first all-india modern election campaign," says a senior leader involved in the election campaign
 is baar ham jaanate hai ki hamen kiske paas pahunchnaa he or kaise pahunchnaa he
 When Modi was giving a speech in Bhubaneswar, 23-year-old IT cell member Hitendra Mehta was on his laptop barely 30 feet away
 ve internet ke jariye yuvaitivi par mukhya raily camera (cricket ke maamle main gend par najar rakhane vaala camera) kii tasveeron ko sidhaa prasaarit kar rahe the
 It was then edited and sent to youtube in small clips
 en-dock team ne modi ke kuch mukhya bayanon ko sidhe twit kiya
 Mehta and his colleague 23-year-old Amit Anirudh Sahu were busy on their laptops sitting right next to them
 bijepi ke swayamsevak photographer lagaataar sahu ko esady storage card de rahe the taaki ve behtareen tasveeron ko twit kar saken
 In the midst of this technical preoccupation, Mehta received a call from the Gujarat Chief Minister's office and asked him for pictures for his own social media
 ek automated number ke jariye modi ke bhaashan ko mobile phonon par bhi suna ja saktaa tha
 Though this service is not free, over the past four months, more than a million people have heard Modi's speeches
 harek swayamsevak kaa istemaalhalanki media ke jariye is tarah ke prachaar se raily kaa asar kai guna bad jaataa he, lekin ity cell kii jamini team sabase mahatvapurn kaam kar rahi he
 When Modi is giving a speech, he is busy hiring other volunteers
 38 varshiya swayamsevak rajesh jain ke netritv main team ke darjan bhar sadsy bhubaneshwar main parche or card baantne main lage hai, jis par desh bhar main ek hi number diya gaya he
 Modi's supporters are asked to make whatsapp, SMS or missed calls on this number

 This database is made according to the location so that the BJP can know how many people are available to serve them in each constituency
 is data ko angesement team ko bhej diya jaataa he, jiskaa netritv 32 varshiya vittiya salaahkaar sunil singh karte hai
 They train these volunteers and send them promotional material
 iske baad unhen us kshetra ke swayamsevakon ke maujuuda network se jod diya jaataa he
 Each volunteer unit reports what it did that day
 is tarah kaa chunaav prachaar america main raashtrapati chunaav prachaar jaisaa he, jahaan chote shaharon main republican or democrat chunaav karyaalayon kaa sanchaalan swayamsevakon or prashikshuon ke bal par kiya jaataa he
 The use of social media in Modi's election campaign is inspired by Barack Obama's 2008 election campaign 'A Change You Can Believe In', in which young Obama supporters supported social media — a new thing for America at the time — And used to create a wave in favor of its leader
 obama kii jeet main ise bhi vajah mana jaataa he
 Arvind Gupta says, "like Obama's election campaign, we have opened 5,000 offices in all 155 constituencies where we are paying more attention
" bijepi ko online baari samarthan praapt he
 We are now using this base through volunteers
 ”modi ke ye samarthak (modifaire) 'modi 4 piem’ donneton fund, da mishan 272 prachaar or 'vot 4 india’ sandesh ke liye kaam karte hai or is baat par jor dete hai ki loksabhaa chunaavon main diya jane vaala harek vot vahaan ke sthaneey ummidavaar ke liye nahin, balki sidhe ummidavaar modi ke liye he
 a key member of the n-doc team laughs and says, "we are preparing the data, now our leaders can build the support base from it
" ”haalanki unka kahana he ki unhone harek bijepi netaa kaa samarthan kiya he, lekin kuch swayamsevak sweekaar karte hai ki unke liye kaam aasaan ho gaya he kyonki pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar modi kaa naam khub bikta he, bhale hi unka ateet daagdar mana ja rahaa ho
 Detailed information about voters is also put in this database

 Further challenge: On February 11, with BJP President Rajnath Singh on his way to Bhubaneswar, his political aide Amit Shah was busy arranging for the biggest public meeting in history at Ramabai Ambedkar Maidan in Lucknow on March 2
 shah sabase zyada 80 loksabhaa siton vaale uttar pradesh main party ke prabharee hai
 Regarding Ramabai Park till now, it is believed that none other than Mayawati can fill this park
 isiilie baaki rajnatik dal is park main raily karne se bachate rahe hai
 Amit Shah, who is preparing for the party headquarters in Delhi, says that Mayawati and Mulayam Singh's rallies will be dwarfed ahead of Modi's Vijay Shankhanad rally
 iske liye lakhanu jane vaali trainon main siten pehle se book kara lee gai hai or aadesh jari kar diya gaya he ki har booth prabandhak ko har haal main kam-se-kam 100 logon ko jutanaa he
 This rally will be very important as Modi can declare his candidature from any seat of Uttar Pradesh
 aisa kar ke ve atal bihari vaajapeyi ke asli uttaradhikari maane ja sakate hai

 isaki tulana main rahul gandhi kaa chunaav prachaar khaasaa paaramparik or bhramit prathit hota he
 His team started using social media late and his online efforts were limited to getting public opinion for the party's manifesto, while the BJP has taken full advantage of the online supporters
 upie-2 kaa niraashajanak kaamkaaj jahaan congress ke gale kii fans ban gaya he, vahiin tivi or radio par bharat nirmaan kaa vigyaapan bijepi ke asafal sabit ho chuke india shining ke vigyaapan jaisaa hi maaloom hota he
 The party is still lagging behind in using modern wave generation techniques
 congress ke netaa sweekaar karte hai, ''hamen abhi bahut kuch karnaa he
 "but they also say their rhetoric," Our fight is against ideology, in which the development of all is necessary
 ham jaanate hai ki hamaari jeet hogi kyonki dharmanirpekshata bharat kii soch main he
 However, on the basis of ideas and technology, Narendra Modi is far ahead of other political parties in terms of campaigning
 unka chunaav prachaar hamen reating, sach ke meter or shaayad america raashtrapati chunaav style ke bahes vaale daur main le ja rahaa he
 But given the social realities of India and its complex caste equations, it is difficult to make any assumptions
 lekin jis din matadaata voting booth par jaakar iviem main desh ke diggajon kaa bhavishya tay karne pahonchega, or agar us samay use namo mantra kaa dhyaan rah jaataa he tabhi is aitihaasik or prachand chunaav abhiyaan kaa kuch phayda najar aayega, anyathaa doodh kaa jala chacha ko bhi phoonk martha rah jayega

 People were shocked when the Delhi Police uncovered an international kidney racket at Apollo Hospital in the capital
 kisi ko yakeen nahin hua ki desh ke nami apollo aspataal main ye dhandha fal-phool rahaa tha
 Actually the strings of this racket were connected to different states of the country as well as foreigners coming to India for treatment
 police ne jab is racket ke ek sargana rajkumaar raav ko giraftaar to kar liya he lekin abhi tak kai raaj uske seene main dafn hai
 Who is t Rajkumar Ravadilli Police arrested t Rajkumar, one of the kingpin of Apollo Hospital Kidney Racket, from Calcutta
 rajkumaar kaa kidney racket ke maamle main purana itihaas he
 He is originally from West Bengal
 lekin usne kidney kharidne bechney kaa kaam chennai ke ek doctor ke saath milakar shuru kiya tha
 Initially Rajkumar was just a small player of this gang
 jo pashchim bengal se logon ko kidney donnet karne ke liye taiyaar karata tha or unke farji dastavej banavaane kii jimmedaari bhi nibhaataa tha
 The man who brought Rajkumar to this business was a doctor in Chennai
 rajkumaar is doctor ke liye kidney bechney waalo kaa intjaam karata tha or badale main use 3 se 4 lakh milte the
 a few years ago, Rajkumar's associate doctor was arrested by the Chennai police who had a kidney transplant in Colombo and his license was also revoked
 lekin jail se jamaanat par baahar aakar us doctor ne rajkumaar ke saath milakar phir se kidney racket shuru kar diya
 He also joined many doctors in this work
 rajkumaar donor arange karata tha or saathi doctor kidney donnet karne vaale ke sabhi test karte the or phir doctor donor or resiver ko colombo le jaakar unka oparation kara diya karte the
 The name kept changing, Rajkumar came to Delhi to escape from the police
 or yahaan bhi usne ye dhandha shuru kar diya
 Different cities got different names from Wahdoners and Rivers
 iske liye vah apane phek fasebuk account bhi banaata tha
 Apart from the prince, it had many names
 upi main raju, bengal main rajkumaar or kuch jagahon par vah apana naam raaj sangam bataata tha
 Delhi Police arrested him from Calcutta
 vah kaaphi dinon se vahiin chipa hua tha
 Rajkumar Transit remand was taken by Delhi Police by presenting it in court
 videshon tak failaa he netvarpolo aspataal main aksar jaani maani hastiyaan apana ilaaj karaane ke liye pahunchati hai
 This hospital is considered to be equipped with all facilities
 lekin kya aap yakeen karenge ki thik sarita vihaar thane or south east zile ke disipi offis ke saamne maujuud is aspataal main chah maheenon se ek bada kidney racket kaam kar rahaa tha? ek aisa kidney racket jiske taar sirf desh hi nahin, balki videshon tak bhi faile hue the
 And who has made crores of rupees, and not millions in business, till now? Apollo Hospitals, the base of kidney racket, looks strange, but now what the Delhi Police has revealed, it is clear that yes, these racketeers Had made this hospital its base
 dilli police ko tab pehali baar is racket kaa pataa chalaa jab ek danpati aapasi jhagade kii shikaayat lekar aspataal ke saamne maujuud sarita vihaar thane main pahunchi
 Actually, both were pawns of Kidneybant's business and both had a fight over the amount of horse-trading
 aise hua tha racket kaa khulaasaajab police ne donon kaa jhagada sulajhane kii koshish kii, kidney racket kii nai kahani saamne aa gai
 After this, the police arrested five businessmen of this racket one by one
 aseem sikadar, satya prakaash urf aashu, devashish mallik, aditya or shailesh saxena
 According to the police, Rajkummar Rao is the mastermind of this racket
 jise giraftaar kar poochtacha kii ja rahi he
 Police are now raiding various places like Kolkata, Chennai and Coimbatore chasing the other businessmen of this racket
 aise kaam karata tha ye kidney racketis racket main har dhandhebaaz ke hisse kaa kaam banta hua tha
 Some hunted for the donor, while some searched for the receiver
 phir shikaar or donor ko rishtedaar dikhaane ke liye farzi kaagazat banaae jate the
 Hospital staff assisted him in this task
 phir donor or resiver ko aspataal main bhartee karavaaya jaataa tha
 And the deal was completed in 10-15 days
 racket main rupayon kii bandarbaant apane-aap main ek chaunkaanewaali baat he
 This racket used to charge 20 to 25 lakhs for the kidneys from the needy
 isamen bichauliyon ko 1-1 lakh rupye milte the
 While only 3 to 4 lakh to the donor
 yahi vajah he ki dhandhebaaz jagah-jagah se donor or resiver kii talash karte hai, farzi kagajaat taiyaar karavaate hai or phir lakhon rupee kii vasuuli karte hai
 The special thing is that for selling kidneys to foreign needy, they get many times more money than Hindustani
 bade doctor bhi hai shaamil!aise main sawaal ye he ki aakhir baaki kii moti raqam kahaan jaati thi
 And this is the reason why the police now feel that there may be many more revelations in this matter
 mumkin he ki dhandhe main koi doctor yaa bada aadmi bhi shaamil ho
 Joint CP RP Upadhyay of Delhi Police says that the police is not giving a clean chit to anyone in the investigation
 zarurat padi ko asapataal ke doctoron se bhi poochtacha kii jaaegi
 According to the police, the strings of this racket are spread not only in Delhi and around but also throughout the country and even abroad
 kahaan jaataa he lakhon rupaya?desh ke nami apollo aspataal main fal-phool rahe kidney racket main rupayon kii bandarbaant ne hi police ko ulajhaa diya he
 Actually, in the investigation so far, it is clear that the purchase and sale of a kidney is in the range of 20 to 25 lakh rupees
 lekin is kareed-farokht kii ek moti rakam rahasyamayi tareeqe se gaayab ho jaati thi
 This means that Donor and Middleman used to get a small portion of this amount
 jabaki resiver se vasuuli jane vaali moti rakam kaa sabase bada hissaa akhir kahaan jaataa he, philhal kisi ko nahin pataa
 And just this question has forced the police to find out the big fish of this business
 yahi vajah he ki ab police ne apollo aspataal prabandhan ko bhi sawaalon kii ek lambii fehrist saunpi he
 However, the hospital management does not want to speak on the matter on camera
 lekin usne apana bayaan zarur diya he
 In this entire case, Apollo Hospital issued an official statement saying, "the police met us a day before about a kidney racket
" hamane police ko sahyog kiya
 And the police gave us the information we asked for
 hamaare yahaan jo bhi kidney transplant hoti he, wo sabhi jaruri document ke saath hi kii jaati he
 We work under a legal process, we were not aware of this incident
 pakade gaye donon pies apollo ke stoff nahin he balki doctoron ke pies he
 We want strict action from Delhi Police in this matter
 " asal main is silsile main ab tak giraftaar kiye gaye logon main do aise hai jo apollo main doctoron ke pies ke taur par kaam karte hai
 And through them, the work of stealing kidney and selling it in Apollo was going on
 or aisa tab tha, jab organ donneton ko lekar behad kade sarkari kanoon maujuud hai
 In the last year too many kidneys were sold, many accused of this racket have said that they have removed about 12 to 15 kidneys in 2015 in Coimbatore too
 rajkumaar raav bhi is dhandhe kaa ek mastermind he
 The police have arrested him
 is maamle main teen mahila donor bhi hai, jinhone paise lekar apni kidney bechi he
 Police have so far recovered the necessary documents, fake voter eye cards, photographs, medical reports, electronic gadgets and about two lakh rupees for kidney transplant from this racket
 philhal is silsile main sirf dilli hi nahin, balki kolkata, chennai samet desh ke kai duusare shaharon main bhi chhapemari kaa silsilaa jari he
 Joint CP RP Upadhyay, who is on the police radar, says to the Delhi Police that police teams are conducting raids in many areas of Delhi besides Kolkata and Chennai
 apollo hospital kii mushkil aane vaale dinon main bad sakati he kyonki asapataal ke kuch or staff member or doctor bhi police ke radar par hai
 What does the law say, according to the Law of Human Argon Transplant Act 1994, only people with blood relations can donate their argon
 cameti kii maujuudagi or docktaron kii nigaraanee main hi transplat prakiya kii ja sakati he
 Only mother, father, brother, sister and grandfather, grandmother can donate kidney to each other
 kidney donneton ke liye bakayaada har aspataal main ek asisment cameti hoti he
 It is very important to do video graphing during the kidney transplant procedure

 Which appeared throughout the match

 Vijender never played as a champion during the entire match

 Vijender Singh did not meet the media after the match

 Raja said that Vijender Singh is a better boxer than Atiyov but today was not his day
 dukh is baat kaa he, raja ne is baat par gaur nahin kiya ki midilwet mukaable main 3 round hote hai jo sirf 9 minute main khatm ho jate hai
 But for a moment in the match held on Monday night, Vijender played like a champion
