 The People's Democratic Party (PDP) demanded the repeal of the Armed Forces Privilege Act (AFSPA) and said that the continuation of this law is an 'impediment to the peace process' when such a changed situation has reduced terrorism considerably
 pidipi sangrakshak mufti mohammad said ne kaha, ‘‘badali paristhiti main jab aatankwaad kaaphi had tak kam ho gaya he or log badhachadhakar loktantric prakriya main hissaa le rahe hai to kanoon ko jari rakhana saamaanya sthiti bahaali or shanti prakriya main baadhak he
 He said, 'removal of AFSPA and complete restoration of democratic institutions is the most important step to address the issue
 ’ The recent decisions of the Supreme Court created history, especially with regard to the personal freedom of the common man
 sabase pehle jo faisla aayaa vah sabase aitihaasik tha jisamen kaha gaya ki samalangikta gaiyrkanoonee nahin he
 The Supreme Court held that section 377 is irrational, arbitrary and incomprehensible and social morality is not a hindrance to the right of the individual
 is faisle ne samaaj main ek aisi bedi ko todaa jo abhi tak chaharadivaaron yaa gharon ke andar tak simit tha
 Homosexuals still lived a life of contempt and contempt in society
 parivaar bhi yah sweekaar karne ko taiyaar nahin hota tha ki unke ghar main koi samalangik he
 This decision gave voice to a section of the society and gave them the right to live in society with respect
 ek or mahatvapurn faisla tha anusuchit jati, janajati samudaay ko pramotion main aarakshan dene ke maamle main
 The decision of five judges was
 isamen sab kuch sarkaar par chhod diya kyonki kanoon banane kaa adhikaar sansad ke paas he, adaalat uski vyakhya hi kar saktaa he
 The most important thing in this was that the government was asked to see the matter of administrative efficiency and left the creamy layer on the Parliament
 phir ek bada faisla aayaa aadhaar card kaa jisamen kisi bhi nijee company ko aadhaar maangane par roak laga di gai
 Linking of Aadhaar with bank accounts has not been made necessary but Aadhaar will be necessary for PAN numbers
 kalyankari yojanaon ke liye aadhaar jaruri rahegaa magar uske chalate kisi kaa haq nahin maaraa ja saktaa he
 One can ask for Aadhaar on the question of national security but for that the permission of former judge or secretary level officer will be required
 lekin is faisle main ek asahmati bhi thi
 She came on behalf of Justice Chandrachud in which she called it with the right of privacy and also commented on the government making Aadhaar bill a money bill and not going to Rajya Sabha
 phir ek or mahatvapurn faisla aayaa ayodhya ram janmabhumi vivaad par, jisamen namaaj padhane ke liye masjid kaa hona jaruri nahin mana gaya or 2010 ke elahabaad hai court ke faisle par koi asar nahin padaa
 This decision was not sent to the larger bench
 adaalat ne kaha ki sabhi dharm, mandir, masjid, gurudwara or carch ek samaan hai or kisi kaa bhi adhigrahan kiya ja saktaa he
 But there was a disagreement in the decision that came from Justice Abdul Nazir, in which he said that a detailed trial was not conducted before the verdict was not necessary for the Namaz
 unhone kaha ki 1994 kaa faisla sawaalon ke ghere main he lihaaja maamla samvidhan peeth ko bheja jaae
 Then another big decision came in which adultery means fornication is not considered a crime
 logon ke liye yah bada atapata faisla tha
 But it is important in many respects, saying that husband and wife do not own
 saath hi adaalat ne kaha ki kanoon langik samanta ke adhikaar ke khilaaf he samvidhan kii khubsuurati he ai,you or me
 
 
 But let me make one thing clear that this law does not mean that now you can have a relationship with any woman and be saved, that woman's husband can still file a case against you
 
 The latest decision is that the doors of the Sabarimala temple in Kerala were also opened for women
 yah mahila adhikaar or samanta ke liye ek bahut bada kadam he
 It is against the patriarchal rule in society, tradition cannot be an integral part of religion and denial of worship would be considered to deny the dignity of the woman
 tippaniyan So all these are such decisions which can be seen in the form of social reform
 isamen kuch aise kanoon the jo angrejon ke jamaane ke the yani victorian kaal ke jinhen badla hi janaa chahie tha
 These decisions have decided that whenever there is talk of equality, security and freedom in the society, the Supreme Court will be at the forefront, that is why people in every village say that they will fight till the Supreme Court because the Supreme Court is the 'supreme

 Then came a big decision of the Aadhaar card, in which any private company was banned from asking for Aadhaar
 bank khaaton se aadhaar jodna jaruri nahin kar diya gaya lekin pan number ke liye aadhaar jaruri rahegaa
 Aadhar will be necessary for welfare schemes but due to this no one can be killed
 rashtriya suraksha ke sawaal par aadhaar maang sakate hai lekin uske liye purv jaj yaa sachiv str ke afasar kii anumati jaruri hogi
 But there was also a disagreement in this decision
 vah justise chandrachud kii taraf se ai jisamen unhone ise niztaa ke adhikaar se kaha or sarkaar dwaara aadhaar bill ko mani bill banane or rajyasabha na jane par bhi tippanee kii
 Then came another important decision on the Ayodhya Ram Janmabhoomi dispute, in which it was not considered necessary to have a mosque to offer Namaz and the 2010 Allahabad High Court decision had no effect
 is faisle ko badi bench ko nahin bheja gaya
 The court said that all religions, temples, mosques, gurudwaras and churches are the same and anyone can be acquired
 magar is faisle main ek asahmati thi jo justise abdul nazeer kii taraf se ai jisamen unhone kaha ki namaaj ke liye masjid ke jaruri na hone par faisla dene se pehle vistrut pareekshan nahin kiya gaya
 He said that the decision of 1994 is under the question of questions, so the matter should be referred to the Constitution Bench
 phir ek or bada faisla aayaa jisamen edltri yani vyabhichaar ko aparaadh nahin mana gaya
 It was a big decision for the people
 magar yah kai lihaaj se mahatvapurn he jisamen kaha gaya ki pati-patni kaa maalik nahin he
 At the same time, the court said that the law is against the right to gender equality, the beauty of the constitution is i, u and me
 
 
 magar ek baat saaf kar duun ki is kanoon kaa matlab yah nahin he ki ab aap kisi bhi mahila se sambandh bana sakate hai or batch jaaen, us mahila kaa pati abhi bhi aap par cese kar saktaa he
 
 sabase taaja faisla he ki kerala ke sabarimala mandir ke daravaaje mahilaon ke liye bhi khol die gaye
 This is a major step for women's rights and equality
 yah samaaj main pitrusattatmak niyam ke khilaaf he, parampara dharm kaa abhinn hissaa nahin ho saktaa or puja se inkaar karnaa mahila kii garima ko inkaar karnaa mana jayega
 The comments to ye sab kuch aise faisle rahe jo samaaj sudhaar kii tarah se dekhe ja sakate hai
 There were some laws which belonged to the British era i
e
 the Victorian period which should have been changed
 in faislon ne yah tay kar diya he ki samaaj main jab bhi samanta, suraksha, swatantraaa kii baat hogi supreme court sabase aage rahegaa yahi vajah he ki gaanv-gaanv main log kehete hai ki are supreme court tak ladenge kyonki supreme court hi he 'supreme

 The way Satya Raghavanhar generation studies and learns is different
 haal ke varshon main adhiktar bharatiyon ne skulon or collejon main ek sanyojit shiksha hasil kii
 Apart from this, he also learned a lot from his classmates, family members and friends
 lekin aaj ke samay main jab sari suchanaaen fatafat uplabdh hai—bahut hi kam kharch main aadha arab se zyada bharatiyon ke liye uplabdh—to seekhney kaa tarika badi teji se badal rahaa he or iskaa shrey online video ko jaataa he
 Online video content is being used extensively across the country due to better connectivity and cheaper data
 sangeet, technology, yatra or jeevanstyli jaise vibhinn vishyon par pehle se hi bahut badi maatra main saamagree uplabdh rahi he, lekin pichley do varshon se bharat main utyub par shaikshik vishyon par bhi bahut teji se saamagree uplabdh hone lagi he
 In demand and incrementally, millions of people watch educational videos on youtube in a single day
 yahaan tak ki bharat main bhi bahut badi sankhya main utyub par kisi cheez ko lekar 'kaise karen' vaale sawaal kiye ja rahe hai
 Our research in the country shows that users are taking advantage of it by asking all kinds of questions on youtube
 unke sawaalon main rosemara kii choti-choti baton (taai kaise baandhen) se lekar shiksha sambandhi sawaal (guna kaise karen) or nae kaushal seekhney vaale sawaal (salsa kaise banaaen) shaamil hote hai
 The audio-visual content available on youtube helps Indian users to get information on all kinds of topics around the world, they understand those topics quickly and easily
 rochak baat yah he ki utyub par seekhney kaa yah chalan keval shahari ilaakon tak simit nahin he
 Now people in second and third tier cities are also taking advantage of youtube to learn anything and improve their livelihood
 shiksha sambandhi saamagree jaise ganit or vigyaan se lekar kheti or photography jaise peshaagat vishyon ke alaava dance or kooking jaise shaukia vishyon par bhi utyub par badi sankhya main video mil jate hai
 They are available in almost all languages and are meant for all age groups
 udhaaharan ke liye, gaanvon main bhi bahut se yujar apane shiksha sambandhi sawaalon kaa jawaab us vishay ke visheshgyon se paa jate hai or use sikhkar pratispardhi parikshaon main safalataa hasil kar rahe hai
 Many teachers in small towns are now making channels in regional languages — especially Tamil and Hindi — which are becoming very popular among students
 sankshipt or sugam saamagreeutyub par shaikshanik saamagree sabhi aayu varg ke logon ke liye vibhinn vishyon ko aasaani se samajhane main madadgaar sabit ho rahi he
 Nowadays many teachers are uploading videos of classroom lectures on their own channels
 wifistady jaise channel online koching centre chalaa rahe hai or ek din main 30 video tak daal rahe hai jinamein sawaal or jawaab ke seshan hote hai
 Such material is not limited to independent teachers only
 shiksha santhaan bhi isaki pahunch or iske vitaran kaa phayda uthaa rahe hai
 For example, NPTELHRD has over 1
5 million subscribers

 gajraj kaa gussa abhi bhi shant nahin hua he
 Gajraj's anger is still on the seventh sky
 iskaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki gajraj ne ek saptaah ke andar duusare mahavat ko maarane kaa prayaas kiya, haalanki wo kisi tarah se jaan bachaa kar bhaaga
 Five days ago, the same Gajraj killed his Mahavat in the Kanwar Yatra procession of the famous saint Mauni Baba
 ilaake main gajraj kii dahshatek baar phir gajraj ne apane duusare mahavat ko patakekar maarane kaa prayaas kiya
 However, Mahavat somehow saved his life by running away
 uske baad bekaabu gajraj kaa gussa yatri vaahanon par nikalne laga
 Gajraj started pushing several vehicles passing through NH 84
 sanyog acha tha ki vaahan chaalak gajraj ke gusse kaa shikaar hone se batch gaye
 During this, there was chaos
 enech se guzar rahe vaahanon ke pahie tham gaye
 Somehow the police was informed
 sanke hathi ke is utpaat se aasapaas ke ilaake main dehshat kaayam he
 People are moving through the fields
 gajraj kareeb do ghante se bavaal machaaye hue tha
 a mahout has been done Janagrajraj's anger took the life of a mahout eight days ago
 juluus main shaamil yah hathi achaanak pagal ho gaya, jiske baad vahaan bhagdad much gai thi
 The incident took place around 8 am last Thursday
 jab mauni baba kii kaanvar yatra baxur-aara enech 84 par pratap sagar gaanv ke paas se guzar rahaa tha
 The mad elephant tried to slash a child involved in the procession by wrapping it in his trunk
 lekin mahavat ne use roak liya tha
 Somehow the child was saved by Mahavat
 lekin khud uske gusse kaa shikaar ho gaya
 Gajraj took his life
 van vibhaag ke adhikariyon ne kiya behoshsanaki hathi ko kaabo main karne ke liye teen thanon kii police va jile ke anya haathiyon ke mahavaton ko bulaayaa gaya tha
 But even then, the elephant's anger did not calm down
 baad main patna se aivan vibhagake adhikariyon ne hathi ko gan injection se behosh kiya tha
 He was chained after being unconscious
 iske baad sakht hidaayat di thi ki kam se kam 15 din tak gajraj ko chhedana nahin he
 Otherwise, his anger may increase
 lekin, aisa nahin kiya gaya
 Then Hathigajraj Kena Mahavat Munnu was with him for the past one week
 hathi bhi mahavat se ghul mil gaya tha
 On Wednesday morning, Munnu started taking him to Ara, seeing his movements tied to a tree near Pratap Sagar
 iske liye gajraj kaa zanjeer khol diya gaya
 However, after walking peacefully for one kilometer, Gajraj suddenly erupted
 gopal deraa ke paas pahunchane se pehle vah garajane laga
 Mahavat, riding on his back with a sharp chin, shook Munnu
 girane ke baad munnu ne kisi tarah bhagkar apni jaan bachaai
 Delhi Women's Commission chairperson Swati Maliwal on Monday raised the matter of exploitation of two minor girls at the shelter home in Dwarka in front of Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and requested them to hand over the management of the shelter home in this matter to the concerned District Magistrate as directed by the Supreme Court
 dilli mahila ayog dwaara shelter home ke audit ke liye banaai gai visheshgy samiti ne shelter home kaa daura kiya tha
 The committee was stunned to see that chillies were added to their private parts as punishment for the girls
 kamare saafe na karne, staff kii baat na maanane par bacchiyon ko or bhi duusari sajaa jaise scale se pitayee kii jaati thi
 The girls were provided with all the household chores in the shelter home
 yah sab kai maheenon se chal rahaa tha
 The matter was taken up with the Deputy Chief Minister by the Commission
 unhone turant mahila evam bal vikaas vibhaag ko jaruri kadam uthaane ke nirdesh die
 Police has registered an FIR in this case and it has been reported that some members of the staff have been arrested by Delhi Police
 ayog ne sambandhit bal kalyaan samiti se anurodh kiya he ki shelter home ke vartmaan staff ko hataaya jaae or nae staff kii tainaati kii jaae
 It is important that girls are given good care immediately so that they do not suffer any more suffering 
 yah jaruri he ki sabhi ladkiyaan saath rahen kyonki lambe samay tak saath rahane se unke bich main gaharaa bhavatmak sambandh ban gaya he
 But the Commission has come to know that the two girls who were the most victimized have been shifted to another home by the Child Welfare Committee while the remaining girls remain in the shelter home

 Addressing the meeting, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that all people should get together for the upcoming elections
 sanghathan ke padaadhikariyon, saansadon or vidhayakon ke saath hui is baithak se media ko dur rakhaa gaya he
 In this meeting, before 2019, emphasis was laid on strengthening the organization in the state
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki chunaav main dhilaai baratane ke maamle main baithak ke baad kade faisle liye ja sakate hai
 Apart from Yogi Adityanath at this meeting, Union External Affairs Minister VK Singh, MP Mahesh Sharma, Gautam Budh Nagar MLA Pankaj Singh, all mlas from Ghaziabad, President of Western Uttar Pradesh Ashwani Tyagi, Mayank Goyal, Ashok Monga, all mps from the West and Legislators joined

 According to sources, the meeting was also reviewed in Kairana and Noorpur by-elections
 saath hi isamen alge loksabhaa chunaav kii ranneeti par bhi charchaa hui
 The party lost Lok Sabha seats of Phulpur, Gorakhpur and Kairana in the by-elections after Yogi Adityanath took power in UP
 saath hi nurpur vidhansabha seat par bhi party haar gai
 Since then, the leadership of Yogi Adityanath has been under increasing scrutiny as the BJP came out with a strong majority in the assembly elections
 akasar aisa hota he ki premi jodon main jahaan ek bahut jaldi dost banane vaala hota he, vahiin doosraa bahut chup rahane vaala
 In such a situation, the program of going out somewhere is postponed before it is made
 yaa agar saath saath saiyr karne ke liye nikal bhi pade, to donon enjvaay nahin kar pate
 In such a situation, if any of your close friends or relatives have a party, then the trouble increases
 isliye jab apane saathi ke saath party main janaa ho, to use blem na karen
 Try not to hurt them with your behavior
 aap chahen to rishte main is vajah se aane vaali daraar ko roak sakati hai
 
 
 Keep away from the feeling of loneliness that most of the friends you meet in parties are those who meet you after a long time
 unase baat karen, lekin apane saathi kii bhaawanaaon kii bhi kadra karen
 He comes to the party at your behest, so it becomes your responsibility not to let him feel lonely
 jab aap donon kisi party main saath jaaen, to apane duusare doston ke saath mast hone ke bajaae apane saathi ko bhi doston se milaayein or koshish karen ki aapkaa saathi unke saath sahaj ho saken
 If he is not comfortable, then express his thinking among friends
 apane doston ko bataaen ki vah kis mizaaj ke hai
 Once he mingles with your friends, he will surely be more interested in you going to the next party
 apane vyavahar ko parakhenjab aap apane pati ke saath kisi bhi party main hon, to is baat kaa dhyaan bhi rakhen ki aap apane pati or doston ko achche se manage kar len
 Some of such friends and husband should never feel lonely
 apane body leguage par dhyaan den, kahin aisa to nahin ki vah kisi ek kii taraf zyada jhukaav dikhaa rahi hon
 Make them partners in all your work and make them feel that they are important for you everywhere
 shuruyaat karen chote kadam sekitna hi bada kaam kyon na ho, uski shuruyaat ek chote kadam se hi hoti he
 Therefore, her husband will have to start making party animals with a small step
 shuruyaat main unhen kisi aise restaraan main le jaaen, jahaan kaa khaanaa unhen behad pasand ho
 During this, make them feel that how much you can enjoy them in small parties like this
 iske dhire dhire unhen logon se milaayein
 Just what then, they too will start to open heartily to every party just like you
 janmashtami kii dher sari shubhakamanaayen! The by-election for Rajouri Garden Assembly seat of Delhi is to be held on 9 April

 The comments aapako bataa den ki congress ke liye yah chunaav behad ahm he kyonki sikh-punjabi bahul rajouri garden seat par congress kii koshish he ki punjab chunaav main jeet kaa phayda uthaae or is seat ko jitkar dilli main apni waapas kaa daawa kare
 Apart from this, the Congress is trying hard to win this election to make Delhi Municipal Corporation feel its strong position in the elections

 Let us tell you that this election is very important for the Congress, because the Congress is trying to win the sikh-punjabi dominated Rajouri Garden seat, that Punjab will take advantage of victory in the election and claim this seat in Delhi by winning this seat
 iske alaava dilli nagar nigam chunaav main apni majboot sthiti kaa ahsaas karaane ke liye bhi is chunaav main jeet ke liye congress jitod koshish kar rahi he
 Let me tell you that Captain Amarinder, the hero of Congress victory in Punjab, came to campaign on this seat last week

 It is believed that this by-election to be held on April 9 will serve as an opinion poll for the municipal elections on April 23

 Many pictures and videos claiming the latest situation in Kashmir have gone viral on social media
 isi bich ek or video teji se share kiya ja rahaa he
 In the video, a crowd of some people are seen leaving the police with tear gas shells
 daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki viral video kashmir kaa taaja video he jahaan police ne muharram kaa juluus nikaal rahe logon ko khadeda
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the viral video is about six years old
 viral post kaa archivd varjanayahandekha ja saktaa he
 With this video viral on Facebook, a caption is being written in Urdu, which translates as: An attempt was made to stop the procession of Muharram, the latest situation in Kashmir
 ' khabar likhe jane tak is video ko kareeb 3000 lokh dekh chuke the
 To find out the truth of the viral claim, when we searched youtube by writing 'protest on Muharram in Kashmir + AP', we found this video on the official youtube channel of 'AP Archive'
 is video ke neeche di gai jaankaree ke saath hamen ek metadatalinkabhi mila jiske anusaar yah video 13 november 2013 kaa he
 According to the information accompanying the video, curfew was imposed in parts of Srinagar during Muharram
 iske chalate jab kuch musalamaanon ne vahaan dharmik juluus nikaala to police va ardhsainik balon ne bheed ko teetar-karne ke liye aansu gas ke gole chode
 We also received a media report confirming the incident
 padtaal main saaf hua ki viral ho rahaa video taaja nahin balki saal 2013 kaa he
 When i first arrived in Silicon Valley, i was surprised
 main bharatiyon kii kamyaabi par research kar rahaa tha or is nattejey par pahunchaa ki yah puri tarah merit aadhaarit he
 My Richters teams at Duke, uc-burke Lay and Harvard reported that 52 percent of new companies (start-ups) in Silicon Valley were started by people from abroad
 bhartiya udhyamiyon ne britain, china, taiwan or japan ke kul pravasi samoohon se adhik start-ap sthapit kiye
 Indians have started 15 percent of Silicon Valley companies, despite having only a six percent proportion of the working population
 shiksha or halaat ke maamle main pravaasiyon ke pichhadepan ke baavjood yah kamyaabi ullekhneey he
 i thought that Silicon Valley should be an example to the rest of the world
 lokapriy blog tekcrunch ke technology sammelan main shaamil hokar or yah dekhakar ankhen khul gayi ki manch par mahilaon kii maujuudagi sirf staff or ek sarkas kalakaaron ke rup main thi
 In more than 100 companies there, none of the women was headed
 shrota adhiktar noujvaan gore mard the
 Some were also from India and China but they were also immersed in the colors of the West
 maine jab agrani technology companiyon kii agxcutive tiimon par najar daali to unamem ek bhi mahila nahin mili
 There is not a single woman in Apple's entire management team
 silicon vaili kii lagbhag sari nivesh companiyon main purushon kaa dabadabaa he
 Some of the women seen on their website were either in marketing or in human resources
 is maamle main sabase aage venture capital companiyaan (visi) raheen
 thefunded
 com kii 2009 kii 89 top visi kii suchi main sirf ek visi kii pramukh mahila thi
 i was also surprised by the criticism of writing about it
 farvari, 2010 main tekcrunch ke liye ek blog main maine likhaa, ‘‘silicon vailiah tum or tumhaari kuch visi main gender kii samasya he
 In response to this, i was surprised by the kind of hate mail, immature online chatter and personal attacks on Twitter
 kuch behad sammanit visi, jinhen main apana dost kaha karata tha, unki email ne to mujhe or bhi chaunkaa diya
 One asked me what was my agenda behind raising this issue like this
 duusare ne chetavanee di, ‘‘vaili main kamyaabi hasil karne kaa yah tarika nahin he
 "someone else asked if i was trying to seduce women and suggested that there are better ways
" inamen se kuch visi mashhoor bhartiya hai, jinke bare main aap akasar padhate rahete hai
 Gender discrimination has no national or racial boundaries
 uske baad se maine purush or mahila udhyamiyon ke maahaul ke antar kaa adhyayan kiya he
 In truth, there is no such difference
 purush ho yaa mahila, sab main lagbhag ek jaisi prerana or kamyaabi ke kaarak hote hai
 But women gain more than men
 sabase pehla phayda to yahi he ki mahilaon ne jin companiyon ko sthapit kiya he vah purushon kii tulana main puunji ke maamle main adhik kifayati hai
 The rate of failure of high-tech start-ups led by women is low
 venture samarthit jo companiyaan mahilaayein chalaati hai unki vaarshik kamai purushon kii companiyon se 12 pratishat adhik hoti he
 Similarly, organizations in which women are ranked higher at the highest level of management have 35 percent more return on equity and 34 percent more overall profit for shareholders
 mahilaon ko board of diarectors man rakhane se bhi behatar nattejey milte hai
 Companies with the highest proportion of women board directors outperform 53 percent of companies with the lowest ratios
 unki bikri par kamai 42 pratishat adhik or nivesh kii gai puunji par kamai 66 pratishat adhik hoti he
 The process of reform in Silicon Valley is underway
 ujagar hote ling bhed par aakrosh he; samaadhaanon par charchaa or amal ho rahaa he; mahilaayein ek-duusare kii madad karne lagi hai; or venture capital system apni baariki se chaanbin kar rahaa he or apane tareeke badal rahaa he
 After studying this problem, i decided to compile a book, asking for views on the challenges faced by women and ways to overcome them
 mujhe yah jaanakar khushi hui ki 500 se adhik madadgaar haath aage bade or unhone is project main mere saath kaam kiya
 Among them, dozens of hands were from India
 innovatting viman naam kii is kitaab kaa vimochan is saal sitambar main hoga
 It has the story of these women and the secrets of their success are told
 bhartiya udyog ko in mahilaon se sikh leni chahie
 There are no women on the board of many Indian companies, including IT
 kul milakar bharat main board main mahilaon kii hissedari sirf 5 pratishat he, jabaki america main 17 pratishat he
 The situation is equally bad at the higher level of management
 infosis, wipro, tisies, tech mahindra or anya companiyon main shaayad hi koi mahila adhikari he
 This is a big loss for them, especially in this new era of computing
 tablet, eps or cloud computing ke is yug main ity upabhokta ko apane ity vibhaagon se milane vaali technology se kahin behatar technology sulabh he
 They can download cheap, cool and lively apps on their ipads, which make their corporate systems seem primitive
 nae jamaane ke in eps ke liye company ke bheetar software deveopments or mentanence karne vaale logon kii jarurat nahin he
 These apps can be customized according to the consumer and anyone can build them with basic programming skills
 isiilie bharat kii outsource companiyon or unke graahakon kii sankhya ghat rahi he, jinamein siio or ity vibhaag shaamil he
 There are many other such efforts, which are changing the entire landscape of technology, creating new trillion dollar opportunities and creating a platform to solve the problems of human beings
 computing, medicine, artificial intelegence, 3di printing, robotics or sensors jaisi kai technology main jabardast tarakkee ho rahi he or daam gir rahe hai
 For example, extremely cheap sensors are available for use in farming systems that monitor soil moisture, maximize water use and minimize harmful chemicals use
 inase kheti ke kaam main kranti aa sakati he
 There are also sensors used to monitor human health and test for diseases
 computer eps sehat ke aankadon ko jinomik aankadon se milakar samajha sakate hai ki hamaare jinom, aadaton or bimariyon ke bich kya sambandh he
 They can also develop holistic treatment
 unase vridhon kii dekhbhaal main madad ke liye robotic sahaayak viksit kiye ja sakate hai or skool kii suvidha se vanchit karodon bacchon ko padhaane ke liye tutor taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai
 Robo can automate manufacturing and it is possible to create modern products from 3D printers anywhere
 is tarah kii technology ke vikaas ke liye shiksha ahm he
 Knowledge of more than one subject is very useful
 aaj purushon se kahin adhik mahilaayein vigyaan ke vibhinn vishay pard rahi hai or silicon vaili main ladakon kii tulana main ladakiyon kii shiksha or dilchaspee kahin adhik vyapak he
 If you combine the education of different subjects with the ability of women and the desire to do better, then a big powerful coincidence happens
 isiilie maanavtaa kii baari chunautiyon se paar paane or duniya ko bachaane main mahilaayein sarvaadhik sakasham hai
 That is why it is important to teach and inspire them
 computer science padhgaye vaali mahilaon kaa anupaat america main 1987 main 37 pratishat ke str se 2012 main girakar sirf 17 pratishat rah gaya
 But the number of IT students in India is increasing
 nascom ke anusaar, ity kii kai companiyon main 24 -32 pratishat mahila karmchaaree hai, jabaki bipiem kaarobaar main unka anupaat 34-42 pratishat he or nae bhartee karmchaariyon main mahila anupaat 38-40 pratishat he
 If India wants to make the dream of dominating the future of technology and creating the next $ 100 billion industry a reality, then women in the innovation economy have to play the role they deserve

 lalakile kii pracheer se pradhanmantri narendra modi ke desh ko sambodhan ne ab tak ke saare record tod daale hai
 Modi broke his previous record of 86 minutes by addressing the nation for the full 95 minutes on the 70th Independence Day
 ye alag baat he ki 95 minute main se lagbhag 80 minute tak piem apni sarkaar kaa pichley do saalon kii uplabdhiyon kaa lekha-jokha dete rahe
 In the last 15 minutes, terrorism was cracked and defied Pakistan

 The entire future of the country had to be drawn and plans were also given
 ek bhavuk pal
 
 sakht faislon kii ghadi
 
 dhants bandhaane kaa samay
 
 
 But after this, the Prime Minister's address from the ramparts of the Red Fort remained confined for 20 to 50 minutes
 kai baar to ye rasaadaaygi jaisaa hi laga
 Instead of talking to the people of the country, PM kept reading his written speech
 kabhi kabhaar rochak lekin akasar ubaau, ekares or boring aankadon vaale
 Turning the pages of history, the speeches of PM Indira Gandhi, who made a fiery speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort, were 45 to 55 minutes

 Congress candidate from Lucknow Lok Sabha seat Acharya Pramod Krishnam said on Sunday that he will pave the way for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya when the Congress government comes
 piem ramamandir ke liye 5 minute nahin nikaal paaeacharya pramod ne patrakaron se baatcheet main kaha 'bhartiya janata party ramamandir par keval raajnneeti karti he

 chunaav ke baad ham mandir nirmaan ke liye gambhir prayaas shuru karenge or congress sarkaar aane par mandir kaa maarg prashast karenge
 The BJP is not serious about temple construction
 'bijepi ne ramamandir ke liye kuch nahin kiyaunhone kaha 'iske liye sabhi pakshakaron or dharmaguruon se baatcheet kii jaaegi
 The BJP only propagates in the name of temple construction
 lekin usne paanch saalon main kuch nahin kiya
 Three brought ordinances on divorce thrice but did not bring ordinances for temple construction
 ' acharya pramod ne kaha ki vah kai muslim dharmaguruon or ulimaon se mil chuke hai
 He says that they too are not opposed to the construction of Ram temple
 unhone kaha ki chunaav ke baad vah sabhi pakshakaron, muslim dharmaguruon or santon ke saath baithkar mandir nirmaan kaa maarg prashast karaayenge
 The Congress candidate said that the construction of Ram temple is a question of faith of crores of Ram devotees of the world

 The Supreme Court has also given arrangements for settling the case by negotiation

 Acharya Krishnam has so far held the Narendra Modi government responsible for not building a Ram temple in Ayodhya

 There is no leader in Congress politics especially from UP who has been vocal about the construction of Ram temple, but Krishnam is an exception

 The saint has many times pleaded with the government to seriously consider the issue

 Is the President having to bow down to the red carpet in the hospitality of the person whose visa has been banned by the US President himself? Is this the first time in America's 300-year-old history when the White House has opened its doors to a person who is banned from visiting the United States? Can gifted people filled with gurur be made their advocates? Friends, you will definitely learn this lesson of breaking Gurur or bowing to someone in front of Narendra Damodar Modi

 Now, in such a situation, if a girl is suffering from a 26-pound wound of a dagger on a rocky road in a city filled with tears, then why should a stone-hearted person come forward to help her? The story is of a girl from Delhi
 kahani iktarafa ishk main pagal ek ladke kii he or kahani pathar ho chuke ek shahar kii bhi he, jahaan murdon ke bich ek maut hoti he
 Karuna, a girl, had gone out of her home for breakfast with her cousin sister in Burari area of north Delhi at 9 am on September 20, but on the way, her old computer teacher suddenly came in front of her and stabbed the girl with a knife
 Started doing iktarafa ishk main pagal tha katildarasal dil ko jhakzor denevaali is kahani kii shuruyaat kareeb teen saal pehle hui thi
 When Karuna enrolled in a training institute for studying computer near home
 computer sikhaane vaale teacher kaa surendra naam tha
 During the course of computer course, Surendra fell in love with compassion
 baat itani badi ki maamla karunaa ke ghar tak pahunch gaya
 Karuna's family also wrote a report to the police, but then the two families later reached a settlement
 samjhauta ye ki ab surendra kabhi karunaa ko tang nahin karegaa or naa hi uskaa peechha karegaa
 After the agreement Surendra Rohini shifted, while Karuna started working in Sant Nagar itself
 aisa laga ki sab thik ho gaya, par ye dhokhaa tha
 Actually Surendra's craze was not over
 wo karunaa ke iktarafa ishk main is had tak pagal ho chukaa tha ki faisla kar liya ki agar wo uski nahin ho sakati, to phir kisi kii nahin hogi
 Knife attack in front of everyone Karuna was passing close to Labor Chowk with her cousin sister at 9 am on 20 September
 tabhi achaanak bike par surendra vahaan pahunch gaya
 He had already decided to kill Karuna
 karunaa ko dekhte hi usne apni bike bich sadak par gira di
 After this, first kicked his anger on the same bike and then broke down on compassion
 pehle hi hamale main usne ek ke baad ek karunaa par chaaku se kul chah waar kiye
 For the first time after the sixth blow, Karuna stumbled and fell on the road
 tamaam log us vakt uske paas se gujarey, sabake saamne surendra karunaa par chaaku se hamale karata rahaa, par kisi kii himmat nahin hui ki wo surendra ko roke
 Meanwhile, a man wanted to save Karuna, but Surendra drove him away
 iske baadasurendra ne jameen par giri karunaa parphir se usee chaaku se hamalaa kiya
 This time he does a total of 16 attacks one after the other
 surendra ab tak karunaa par do kishton main kul 22 waar kar chukaa tha
 Meanwhile, the knife slips from his hand
 wo khadaa hota he, par phir agle hi pal mudata he or ab karunaa ko laat se martha he
 During this, a man tries to move towards him to stop him, but Surend also scares him away
 phir wo jameen par baithta he or teesri kisht main karunaa par usee chaaku se do or waar karata he
 Then stops and finally for the fourth and last time he strikes the last two with a knife on Karuna
 mobile se lee marati karunaa kii photoiske baad wo puure itmeenaan se jeb se mobile nikaalata he
 Mixes someone's number and then talks to him
 wo phir se karunaa ke kareeb jaataa he or uskaa mobile chin kar use sadak par hi todane lagata he
 By then the crowd on the road increases and people grabbed him and started beating him
 ek chashmadid ke mutabik karunaa ko maarane ke baad usne apane mobile se uski tasviir bhi lee or phir use whats ap par kisi ko bhej kar bataaya ki usne karunaa ko maar diya he
 The connection of the murder to the mobile is currently waiting for police to interrogate Surendra as he is badly injured by beating people after the murder
 haalanki logon kii maane to is vaardaat kaa donon ke mobile phone se koi naa koi rishta jarur he kyonki katl ke baad jab tak logon ne kaatil ko kaabo main nahin kiya tha, tab tak wo ladki kaa mobile phone nikaal kar use tod chukaa tha
 Surendra is the son of a retired sub-inspector of Delhi Police and is already married, but is having a dispute with his wife

 Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has praised Team India captain Virat Kohli for the historic series win against Sri Lanka
 gavaskar ne kaha ki is yuva captain ne apane behad sakriy ravaiye se bejod netritv kshamta ke shuruaati sanket die hai
 India won the first series in 1993 after beating Sri Lanka by 117 runs in the third and final Test at SSC
 kohli captain ke rup mempahali siries jeetihai or captain ne jis tarah team ko sambhala ussegavaskarsantusht hai
 Gavaskar said, "he is a very active Test captain which is very important
 vah chizon ko karne kii yojana banaata he or kabhi kabhi aisa nahin hota kyonki yah khel kii prakruti he
 But you can see that in the meantime when he changes the bowling, you can see the way his fielding decorates, he keeps trying to do something, not a single moment comes when he gets the match out of his reach Let it go ’unhone kaha, ‘yah mahatvapurn cheez he
 He keeps trying to do something so that the opposing team is frustrated and he comes into a strong position and it is a position of great benefit
 beshak jab majboot tiimon ke khilaaf khel rahe ho to aasaani se safalataa nahin milti or tab pariksha hoti he lekin shuruaati sanket kaaphi utsahjanak hai
 Meanwhile, Gavaskar also taught fast bowler Ishant Sharma who took eight wickets in the match to show undue aggression on the field
 unhone kaha, ‘gusse vaala tej gendbaaj jaruri he kyonki vah aakar puri jaan lagaakar gendbaaji karata he or apana sab kuch jhonk detaa he
 He should control his aggression after the goal of dismissing the batsman
 naaraazgi kii jagah jashn ko le leni chahie
 The resentment should not increase so much that an ugly situation arises
 agar yah santulan banaae rakhaa gaya to gusse vaala tej gendbaaj hone main koi pareshaani nahin he

 US Navy seals killed Osama bin Ladenco through an operation in Abbottabad, Pakistan
 is abhiyaan ke bare main ab nayaa khulaasa hua he
 Information about bin Laden's whereabouts by a former Pak intelligence officer 2
 5 karod dollar ke inaam ke badale main america ko di thi
 Osama was living as a prisoner in the city of Abbottabad under the patronage of ISI
 yah jaankaree ek report main di gai he
 According to American investigative journalist and writer Semar M
 Hersh, 'in August 2010, a former senior intelligence officer from Pakistan contacted Jonathan Bunk, the then CIA station chief at the US Embassy in Islamabad
 usne siie ko bin laden kaa pataa bataane ke prastaav diya or iske evaj main vah inaam maanga, jo ki washington ne varsh 2001 main uske sir par rakhaa tha
 "the intelligence officer was a member of the military, who is based in Abwashington and working as an adviser to the CIA," Hersch said
 america ne adhikari dwaara uplabdh karwaai gai jaankaree kii pushti kii or is parisar ko upgrah kii nigaraanee main rakhaa
 The Americans later informed the ISI about this
 ‘da cills ke ek vyakti or do anya logon’ ne is abhiyaan ko anjaam dene se pehle hamalaa bolne kaa abhyaas kiya
 "the Obama administration lied," Hersh said in an interview to The Dawn of the Pakistani newspaper, "although it was a difficult decision, Pakistan was finally persuaded and told about the plan to kill Osama
" harsh ne kaha ki obama prashasan ne osama ko maarane ke abhiyaan ke bare main jo kuch bhi bataaya, vah kaalpanik tha or asal kahani puri tarah alag thi
 'pasha and Kiani had information' Hersh said, 'the most tremendous lie was told that two of Pakistan's most senior military leaders - General Ashfaq Parvez Kiyani (then Army Chief) and General Ahmed Shuja Pasha (then ISI Chief) were sent to the US
 The campaign was never told
 ’ jab americanyon nepakistani sarkaarase sampark kiya or osama ke bare main poocha to iesai ne jor dekar kaha ki use maar diya jaae or uski maut kii ghoshnaa is abhiyaan ke ek saptaah baad kii jaae
 'pakistan was shocked by the news' Hersh said,' Pakistan was shocked by this news
 yah unke liye bahut apmanjanak tha
 He said, "pakistan has a good army but not bad, but this news presented him with a bad-looking image
 ’ harsh ne yah bhi kaha ki osama ke thikaane kaa pataa lagane main siie kii madad karne ke liye peshawar kii jail main band chikitsak doctor shakeel afridi siie se hi jude the lekin vah is abhiyaan ke bare main nahin jaanate the
 Afridi was used as a cover to hide the real story
 yah gujarat police kii chhavi par haal ke daur kaa shaayad sabase bada dhabba he
 Had the incident unfortunately not happened at the time of Modi's coronation from Gujarat, the incident of shooting 57-year-old Amrit Prajapati, the main witness against rape accused Dharmaguru Asaram and his son Narayan Sai, would have made headlines in the media across the country
 prajapati 2008 se hi donon baap-bete ke kathith kukarmon ko ujagar kar rahe the
 He presented to the public the details of the hypocrisy of the religious leader and the sexual abuse of female followers
 ab donon baap-bete alag-alag maamalon main kareeb salbhar se jail main hai
 The attackers are reportedly said to be supporters of Asaram
 prajapati ko 22 may ko rajkot ke unke clinics main goli maar di gai thi
 Prajapati went into unconsciousness two days later and died on 10 June
 is maamle main gujarat police kii bhoomika par kai gambhir sawaal uth khadey hue hai
 Saroj, 37, Prajapati's wife, and his relative Modibhai Prajapati said that Prajapati had himself named the names of five suspects before going into unconsciousness two days after the incident but the police have not been able to arrest a single suspect while his death 18 days later Hui
 isse sawaal khadey hue ki kya yah police kaa nikammapan he yaa vah hajaaron karod ru
 k is under heavy pressure from Asaram Ashram
 narendra modi or gujarat main unki uttaradhikari anandiben patel, donon hi asaram ke galat kaaryon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai ke paksh main bataae jate hai lekin gujarat police ke aalaa mahakme main asaram se mileebhagat kii khabaren bhi aam hai
 Last year, evidence of this was also found at a time when senior police officers paid Rs 6 crore to Asaram's men
 ke saath pakadaa tha
 He was going to give this amount to a junior police officer investigating the case of Narayan Sai in Surat
 rakam 15 karod ru
 Was part of the deal
 us police inspector ko bhi giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 Saroj has also been a follower of Asaram
 vah puuchhati hai, ‘‘kya koi andeh he ki kisne unhen maaraa? asaram mere pati ko nigal gaya
 Only CBI investigation can reveal the truth
 ’’ jaahir he, gujarat police ab bachaav kii mudra main he
 a senior official reassures, saying, "whatever happens, we will catch the culprits
" ’’ yah bayaan bhi bahut der se aayaa he
 The ideal situation would have been to provide police protection to Prajapati, even if he himself did not demand it
 prajapati asaram ashram se 1989 main ayurveda vibhaag ke prabharee ke naate jude the
 According to the statements made in Prajapati's media in 2008 and after that, after a few years, he was knocked out that Asaram was making drugs to create sex stimulus on one occasion or the other
 unka aarope tha ki 1992 main unhone ahmedabad ashram main asaram ko ek mahila anuyaayi ke saath sex karte dekha or uske baad aisi kai harakatein jaanee
 But Prajapati said that he kept avoiding opening his mouth due to fear of Asaram's disciples
 aakhir 1996 main unhone ashram chhodie kaa saahas bator liya
 (amrit Prajapati) Apparently, Asaram's disciples allege that Prajapati was a fraudster and the reason for his rebellion was to raise money
 dilachasp yah bhi he ki asaram ke shishyon ko yah sikh di jaati thi ki guru par sawaal khadaa karnaa sansar main sabase bada paap he
 So, his disciples have an old history of attacking the Guru against those who question him
 asaram ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane vaale raju chandak par bhi pehle hamale hue
 In addition, many followers of Asaram have heard stories about how they were used as violent tools to gain illicit wealth and silence opponents
 prajapati 1996 main ashram chhodie ke baad 2008 main khulkar saamne aae jab asaram ke kai anuyaayi unki kaali karatuuton ke khilaaf khulkar bolne lage
 They made several allegations of sexual exploitation of women, illegal property grabbing and black magic
 sabarmati nadi ke kinare asaram ke ek skool main kathith rup se kaala jaadu ke prayog se do bacchon kii maut ke baad unke virodh main awaajen mukhar hui thim
 The Gujarat government had instituted a judicial inquiry into the case, but the charges could not be proved
 prajapati kaa yah aarope bhi tha ki ahmedabad main asaram kaa mahila ashram ‘‘uski rakhaalon kaa deraa’’ he
 He had also said that Asaram did not just eat sex stimulant drugs himself, but also used to feed the woman by mixing in milk before coitus
 sanyog se, pichley saal jodhpur main jis ladki ke saath duraachaar ke aarope main asaram 10 maheene se jail main he, usne bhi apane bayaan main kaha ki pehle use doodh pilaayaa gaya tha
 Prajapati was fearless
 akasar ve aatmaraksha ke liye bagal main pistaul taangkar idhar-udhar aate-jate the, taaki asaram ke gundon ke hamalon se bache rahen
 Prajapati's courage was enough to show that he is raising his voice against injustice
 ve asaram or uske bete narayan sai kii karatuuton ko vistaar se bataate the, isliye media main bhi kaaphi lokapriy the
 His friends often cautioned him with Asaram's strength, but as if there was an obsessive attitude against Asaram in Prajapati
 unki jindagi kaa mishan thah asaram kii karatuuton ko taarkik parinti tak pahunchaana
 Although he lived in Ahmedabad and used to visit the clinic of Vadodara and Rajkot once a week, but also took time out for his mission

 He was a Gandhian and his simple simple personality smelled of his soil

 On the birthday of Bhavani Prasad Mishra, today we are presenting three of his best poems to the readers of Darinda, the king of the jungle, the dense forest of Satpura, 'sahitya Aaj Tak'
 1
 In the voice of the beloved man, i said in welcome, as soon as i opened my door and opened the door, that the late man was a little too much! jangal ke rajajangal ke raja, saavdhaanjangal ke raja, saavdhaan !o mere raja, saavdhaan !kuch ashubh shakun ho rahe aaj
 The one who can hear the distant word, he falls in my heart, oh, i am afraid of this movement
 ye yatri yaa ki kisaan nahin,unki-si inaki baan nahin,chupake chupake yah bol rahe
 If he were a traveler, he would have sung, and if he had lit a little, he would have been speaking something poisonous
 ve ek ek kar badhate hai,lo sab jhaadon par chadhate hai,raja ! jhaadon par he machaan
 King of the jungle, be careful! o my king, be careful! Don't get angry, king, you don't go to those people; they are all killers
 ve dur baithkar maarenge,tumse kaise ve haarenge,mana, nakh tej tumhaare hai
 "they never eat me, then why kill me now?" You cannot think the king
 tum bahut vir ho, bhole ho,tum isiilie yah bole ho,tum kahin soch sakate raja 
 They are not hungry, they are quite well, they are thirsty for 'wah wah'
 ye shur kahe jaayange tab,or kuch ke man bhayenge tab,he chamade kii abhilash inhen,ye jag ke, sarv-shreshth praani,inke dimaag, inke vaani,phir anachar yah manamaana!raja, gusse main mat aana,tum un logon tak mat janaa

 satapura ke ghaney jangalsatapura ke ghaney jangal
 Sleepless woods drowned in sleep
 jhaad unche or neeche,chup khadey hai aankh miche,ghaas chup he, kaas chup hamook shawl, palash chup he
 If you can get sunken in it, there is no wind in the sun, in which the dense forests of Satpura are passing through the wild
 sade pattey, gale pattey,hare pattey, jaale pattey,vanya path ko dhank rahe-sepank-dal me paley pattey
 Come on, if you can walk on them, then you can team them, these thick, dense forests are drowned in the darkness, moving through the wilderness
 atpati-uljhi lataain,daaliyon ko khinch khaaain,pair ko pakaden achaanak,praan ko kas len kapaaain
 Jungle made of snake-like black vine makadiyon ke jaal munh par,or sar ke bal munh paramchharon ke dansh vaale,daag kaale-laal munh par,vaat- jhanjha vahan karte,chalo itnaa sahan karte,ksht se ye sane jangal,neend me duube hue seounghate anmane jangal

 Within these forests, four roosters, four pheasants, sat comfortably, seated among the visionaries, the skulls would pour on the hut and the blacks
 jab ki holi paas aati,sarsaraati ghaas gaati,or mahue se lapakati,matt karti baas aati,gunj uthte dhol inke,geet inke, bol inkesatapura ke ghaney janglenind me duube hue seunghate anmane jangal
 In the waking trenches, in the lair-trenches, grass-nuts, kas-nuts, shawls and palash-nuts, lata-nuts, vata-nuts, dala-madas, paat-mad chickens and partridges, within these forests

 There is no fear in them, this is not the house of death, many people who descended, many people say, kal-katha, these forests adopted them

 The Aam Aadmi Party, which achieved unprecedented success in the Delhi Assembly elections held in December last year, is now eyeing the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 dilli vidhansabha se sansad kii duuri mahaj saat kilometre he lekin yah safar arvind kejariwal kii party ke liye itnaa aasaan bhi nahin he
 According to the India Today Group / c voter survey conducted before the general election, the Aam Aadmi Party can get 10 seats in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 survey ke mutabik party ko kul vot share kaa aath fisadi milane kaa anumaan he
 In this way, Aam Aadmi Party can become the third party in the country according to vote share
 haalanki, abhi aam chunaav hone main kaaphi vakt baaki he
 The Aam Aadmi Party does not have an organizational structure in most states
 yahaan tak ki kai kshetron main party ne apana abhiyaan bhi shuru nahin kiya he
 In such a situation, the vote share of the party is expected to improve in the next few months
 mana ja rahaa he ki aane vaale kuch dinon main vot share ke pratishat main paanch fisadi kaa sudhaar hoga or is tarah party ko 30 siten mil sakati hai
 If this happens, the Aam Aadmi Party can become the third largest party after Congress and BJP
 agar party thodaa or jor lagaati he to yah aankada 50 ke aasapaas pahunch saktaa he
 In such a situation Kejriwal can be a 'kingmaker' but not a 'kingmaker'
 agar aam aadmi party kaa vot share 25 fisadi se adhik rahaa to party ko 300 se adhik siten mil sakati hai or aisi sthiti main kejariwal kii party apane boote centre main sarkaar bana sakati he
 It is not impossible to happen because 70 per cent of the people surveyed believe that the Aam Aadmi Party will be able to perform in the Lok Sabha elections like Delhi Assembly elections
 arvind kejariwal ne apane pehle ke stand se you-turn lete hue 18 janvari ko ek tivi intervyuu main kaha, 'agar mere party ke log chaahate hai to main loksabhaa chunaav laduunga
 There are also reasons for Kejriwal's confidence
 survey main shaamil logon main se 37 fisadi kii najar main kejariwal sabase zyada pasand kiye jane vaale gaiyr-bijepi or gaiyr-congressi pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar hai
 It is worth noting that according to one such survey conducted in August last year about six months, only one percent people considered him the most preferred PM candidate in this category
 gaiyr-bijepi or gaiyr-congressi piem pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par mayawati kii lokapriyata main koi badlaav nahin hua he
 Even in the survey conducted in August, seven percent people considered Mayawati as their first choice and the same is the case even today
 is tarah mayawati is list main duusare paaydaan par barkaraar hai
 It is a matter of great pleasure for Kejriwal that within a month of becoming the CM of Delhi, he has taken away the crown of 'best CM' from Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 survey main shaamil 25 fisadi logon kaa maananaa he ki kejariwal desh ke sabase eemaandaar rajaneta hai
 However, critics do not seem to agree that the Aam Aadmi Party will perform brilliantly in the next general election
 inkaa kahana he ki rashtriya str par chunaav ladane ke liye party ke paas majboot sanghathan kii kami he
 Apart from this, there is also less time left to raise funds for the election campaign or to hire an advertising / PR agent
 lekin, party ek baar phir apane tareeke se raajnneeti kii paripati badalane main jute gai he
 The Aam Aadmi Party is filling up forms from people willing to contest the Lok Sabha elections and is campaigning vigorously for membership
 party ke ye kadam agle aam chunaav main phayda pahunchaa sakate hai
 It is expected that in a few weeks, about 20 lakh people will join the party either online or under the 'main Bhi Aam Aadmi' campaign
 agar desh main gaiyr congressi, gaiyr bijepi sarkaar banati he to pradhanmantri ke rup main aapaki pehali pasand koun hoga?[if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" latentstylecount="156"> < / w:latentstyles>< / xml><![endif][if gte mso 10]><style> / * Style Definitions * / table

 He said, 'this is a political revolution we have witnessed
 'lekin 'aap' ke is safar main kai rukaawatein bhi hai
 The support base of the party is still very localized which is limited to a few states like Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Uttarakhand
 in rajyon main agar party kaa vot share bahut zyada rahegaa to dakshin or purab ke rajyon main party ko kuch nahin milane vaala he
 However, AAP has started preparing extensively in important states of North India like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Haryana
 'aap' ke ek senior netaa ke mutabik party ab maharashtra or madhya pradesh jaise rajyon par focus karegi jahaan party kaa sanghathan pehle se hi taiyaar he
 More than 3 lakh people have joined the party in Maharashtra alone and it has opened offices in 34 districts in the state
 aam aadmi party ke senior netaaon main yogendra yadav haryana se, mayank gandhi or anjali damania maharashtra se jabaki sanjay singh or kumaar vishwaas upi se loksabhaa kaa chunaav lard sakate hai
 The party units of Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka have also indicated that they are ready for the Lok Sabha elections
 dakshin ke rajyon main apni pakad banane kii raah main aane vaali chunautiyon kaa saamana karne or chanda jutaney va ummidavaaron ke chunaav jaise masalon se nipatane ke liye aam aadmi party ne teen sadasyeey rashtriya prachaar samanvay samiti banaai he jisamen yogendra yadav, sanjay singh or pankaj gupta jaise senior netaa shaamil hai
 The committee has so far received applications from over 200 candidates, most of them from states like Bihar and Haryana
 sanjay singh ne 'india today' se baatcheet main kaha, 'dakshin ke rajyon main hamaare abhiyaan kii gati thodi dhimi he lekin ham kadi mehnat kar rahe hai
 Large scale membership campaigns are being conducted in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala
 ' party kii yojana he ki har rajya main 50 fisadi se adhik jilon main apni upasthiti darj kara lee jaae
 Senior AAP leaders say that the party will adopt the same strategy as it was in the Delhi assembly elections
 har jile ke liye masale or party ke sandesh tay kiye jaaenge
 An army of party workers will carry this message from house to house
 party ke iti cell ke mutabik digital marketing stritji is tarah hogi ki har jile ke liye fasebuk par pej banaae jaaenge jahaan sthaneey nivasee apane samasyaon par charchaa kar sakate hai
 However, the party still does not have a comprehensive national policy
 kejariwal kehete hai, 'swaraj hamaara lakshya he
 According to him, before the general elections, the economic and foreign policy of AAP will be put in front of the country

 He said that people are sent to mps so that they can raise the problems of their constituency in Parliament

 Lok Sabha Speaker Birla said that the House should run as much as possible for the purpose of public welfare

 Nevertheless, there was a gap when the Lok Sabha proceedings were interrupted for the maximum time
 unhone kaha ki alag-alag vichaardhaara kii vajah se aisa hota he, lekin alag-alag vichaardhaaraon ke hone ke baavjood jab desh kaa sawaal aata he, to vichaardhaara se upar uthakar log saath khadey hote hai
 This should be the expression in Parliament
 unhone kaha ki jab bhi desh kaa sawaal aata he, to sabhi dalon ko apni vichaardhaara se upar uthakar saath khadaa hona chahie
 The House runs with the consent of all
 is baar satta paksh ke saath vipaksh ne bhi saath diya
 Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement, Birla said that the House runs unanimously, not by majority

 Party general secretary Rahul Gandhi, who is running an ambitious mission-2012 to return the Congress to power in Uttar Pradesh, especially by wooing the young voters, for the first time in his two-day visit on Tuesday, faced the strong opposition of the youth on issues like inflation and corruption
 Had to do
 pradesh main agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ke morche par jeet ke liye mishan 2012 main apni tamaam takat jhonk rahe rahul ne gat 10 janvari se shuru hue rajya ke apane do divasiy daure par chaatr-chaatraon tathaa yuvaaon se mulaakaat kar unke sawaalon ke jawaab dene ke vaaste elahabaad, lakhanu, jhaansi or agra kii yatra kii
 However, opposition parties, including the Samajwadi Party, the Left and the Bharatiya Janata Party, used their youth activists to oppose Rahul, and he was also able to gain considerable media attention through it
 sapa pravaktaa rajendra choudhary ne kaha, rahul kaa yuvaaon se milanaa congress pryojit agenda he
 The youth of the state have understood these tactics of propaganda very well
 ve jaanate hai ki badi-badi baaten kiye jane ke baavjood unke liye kuch nahin kiya gaya
 He alleged that the protests of the youth during Rahul's visit were natural as the mother of inflation, unemployment and corruption had filled her with anger over the policies of the Congress

 Addressing the farmers after the inauguration of Shri Singaji Thermal Power Project in Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh, the Prime Minister claimed that to provide basic amenities in rural areas, the existing law needs to be changed
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, "pehle jo kanoon bana tha wo aapako zamin dene ke liye manaa kar rahaa tha, kya usamen sudhaar hona chahie yaa nahin? The Prime Minister accused the opposition of trying to block the government's development agenda and misusing its majority in the Rajya Sabha, adding, "you have a majority in the Rajya Sabha
" is bahumat se aap desh ke vikaas kii gaadi ko mat rokie
 It is a fact that we do not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha
 aapke bahumat ke bina ham desh kii bhalaai kaa kaam nahin kar paaenge"
 On the other hand, the Congress is firm in its decision to oppose the proposed amendments to the Land Acquisition Act
 party concent close or saamaajik asar ke adhyayan se kuch projects ko baahar rakhane ke sakht khilaaf he
 Former Law Minister and senior Congress leader Veerappa Moily told NDTV, "how can we support the Land Acquisition Bill? The law has weakened by the amendments the government has made
 ye kisaanon ke hit ke khilaaf he"
 It is clear from the attitude of Congress that it will not be easy for the government to move forward in Parliament on the new Land Acquisition Bill
 mushkil ye he ki is bill ke khilaaf vipaksh lamaband ho rahaa he or bina raajnneetik sahmati ke ise rajyasabha main paas karana endie sarkaar ke liye ek mushkil chunauti sabit ho saktaa he

 The money in the government coffers will be spent in schemes for the poor and the gap between rich and poor will be bridged
 yah ummid ab nahin kii ja sakati
 The Central Reserve Bank has declared an incremental cash reserve ratio of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 (rs 6 lakh crore till November 18) collected with the country's banks
 matlab yah ki bainkon ke paas maujuud yah paisa waapas bazaar main nahin aa saktaa
 He will not get any interest from the Reserve Bank on this money
 yah paisa ek raddi kaagaj ke tukade tak tabatak bainkon ke paas padaa rahegaa jabatak kendra sarkaar is paise ke evaj main bainkon ko nai karency nahin muhaiyaa kara detii he
 At the same time, the central government has now banned the replacement of invalid currency of Rs 500 and Rs 1000
 in noton ko ab 30 disambar tak sirf bank khaaton main jamaa kiya ja saktaa he
 The central government estimates that by the last date of depositing, the banks will collect an invalid currency of about Rs 10 lakh crore
 bainkon kii ummid par phiraa paniarthik maamalon ke jaankaar or india today sampadak anshuman tiwari kaa maananaa he ki rigerv bank ke siaraar badhaane ke faisla ne bainkon ko musiibat main daal diya he
 According to him, after the demonetisation process, banks were expected to cut the interest rates with the help of the extra money deposited and put this extra money back in the market in the form of new debt
 ab yah sambhav nahin he
 Impact on Banks 1
 bainkon main jamaa hua adhikansh paisa aam aadmi kii jeb se niklaa vah cash he jo khapat (kharch) ke liye rakhaa hua tha
 This money has been spoiled by reaching the bank at a time when the economy was eagerly waiting for demand to grow
 2
 People with black money have succeeded in securing their money by taking advantage of the rules by depositing money in Jan Dhan accounts and poor public accounts
 yahi vajah he ki mahaj 16 dinon main jandhan khaaton main 21 hajaar karod rupee jamaa ho chuke hai
 3
 notebandi prakriyashuru hote hi bainkon ne dhadlle se pratibandhit karency ko badalane kaa kaam kiya
 With this, he got a lot of old notes
 ab rigerv bank se nai karency badalane ke kaam ke liye nahin di ja rahi he or puraani karency use philhal apane paas hi rakhane kaa farmaan de diya gaya he
 4
 bank ko jahaan ummid thi ki vah nae karj dekar apane kaarobaar ko kai guna badha legaa vahiin ab uske paas puraane khaaton ko chalaane kii samasya paidaa ho chuki he
 Unless the Reserve Bank frees it from this restricted currency, it cannot bring any new scheme for its existing customers and new customers
 jis notebandi ko vah apni bimaari kaa ilaaj samaj rahaa tha aaj vahi uske liye sabase badi bimaari ban chuki he
 5
 7 disambar ko rigerv bank nai maudrik niti lekar aa rahi he
 In this policy, even if it cuts the repo rate, it is impossible for banks to carry forward the rate cut
 uske paas rakhi yah pratibandhit karency ab sabase bada enpie ban chukaa he
 Effect on the common man: The biggest impact of this decision of the Reserve Bank is certain to fall on the common man
 sabase pehle rigerv bank ke kaledhan par aane vaale nae aankade uski is dharna ko khatm karne degaa ki desh main kaledhan ke khilaaf notebandi kii prakriya main uskaa koi phayda hone vaala he
 Along with this, many of his other expectations are certain to wane
 kaledhan par lagaam lagane ke liye uthaae gaye kadam se aam aadmi ko ummid thi ki bank apane byaaj daron badi katautee kaa elaan karegaa
 With this, he will get loans for other sponsorships like home, car, business at cheap rates
 2
 The common man hoped that due to the increased income of the bank, he would get good interest on fixed deposits and other savings schemes
 lekin maujuuda faisle ne bainkon ko phixd diposit jaise popular skiimon ko band karne kaa rasta saaf kar diya he
 The bank is not going to make such offers without earning
 3
 State Bank of India, the country's largest state-run bank, has reduced the interest rate on savings bank account to less than 4 percent, given the current situation
 rigerv bank ke is faisle se ab aam aadmi ke liye bainkon main paisa jamaa karnaa itnaa lubhaavna nahin rah jayega

 To prove BJP false in this case, he tweeted on Wednesday evening after the Parliament proceedings were over

 Let us tell you that when the Parliament session started after the Christmas holidays on Wednesday, after the demand of the main opposition party Congress, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley gave clarification on this issue
 netaa sadan arun jetali ne do line ke bayaan main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii us tippanee kaa jawaab diya, jise lekar congress kai dinon se sansad kii kaarywahi nahin chalane de rahi thi
 After lunch Arun Jaitley said in his statement, 'PM Modi in his speech did not question the patriotism and loyalty of former PM Manmohanaya former Vice President Hamid Ansari nor did he have any such intention
 aisi koi bhi dharna galat he
 We honor these leaders, as well as their commitment to the country
 jetali ke is behad sankshipt bayaan ke baadaraajyasabhaamein vipaksh ke netaa or congress saansad gulam nabi aaazaad ne bayaan diya
 He said, 'we the leaders respect the statement of the House

 Therefore, we also do not support any remarks and statements made against the Prime Minister during the election campaign
 pradhanmantri ke khilaaf koi bhi apmanjanak bayaan nahin diya janaa chahie
 With this reply of Arun Jaitley, the proceedings of Parliament started in a ruckus last week
 congress ne aage bhi sadan ko sahi tareeke se chalane dene kaa bharosa jataayaa
 However, it has become clear from Rahul Gandhi's tweet that even though this issue has ended in Parliament, but outside Parliament, he will continue to attack BJP on this issue

 bharat ke vyanjan, china ke hotpaat se zyada masaaledaar ho sakate hai or bharat kii arthvyavastha kaa taapmaana bhi china se adhik ho saktaa he
 At this time, when there is talk of overheating in China, the growth rate of the economy is boiling
 (da iconomist, november 2006)congress jo endie ke jidipi aankada badal formule ke baad upie ke daur main vikaas dar kii chamkaar par nrityrat he, uske netaa kya yaad karnaa chahenge ki jab 2006-07 kii duusari timahi main bharat kii vikaas dar 8
 9 percent had reached, what were they saying then? The UPA government was apprehensive that India's growth rate has gone too fast
 isliye karj kii maang kam karke byaaj dar badhanaa galat nahin he
 According to the new historical data of GDP, during this time, India's growth rate had reached the floor of ten percent for the first time
 or bhaajapa kaa to kahana hi kya! farvari 2015 main jab usne jidipi (aarthik utpaadan kii vikaas dar) kii gananaa kaa aadhaar or formula badla tha tabhi hamane is stambh main likhaa tha in aankadon ko jab bhi inkaa ateet milegaa to upie kaa daur chamak uthegaa yani ki mandi or bekaari ke jis maahaul ne 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa kii abhootpurv jeet kaa rasta kholaa tha vah in nae aankadon main kabhi najar nahin aayega
 According to the data we have got from the new formula of GDP and changes in base year, the economic growth rate in two ten years of UPA is 8
 1 fisadi gati se badi jisamen do saal (2007-08, 2010-11) das fisadi vikaas dar ke the or do saal paanch fisadi or usase neeche kii vikaas dar ke
 Average growth rate under the leadership of Modi government
7
 3 fisadi rahi
 The new method of GDP calculation is scientific
 congress is aankade par itaraayegi or bhaajapa is bahes ko hameshaa ke liye khatm karnaa chaahegi ki uski vikaas dar kaa farrata upie se tej tha kyonki nae aankade aane se ek din pehle hi pradhanmantri ne laal kile ke shikhar se, apane netritv main bharat kii ricard aarthik vikaas dar par jayakaara lagaaya tha
 But beyond politics, would our leaders want to learn that economic figures are not orphans, they also have a past and a future and these figures are not of their politics but of the indescribable economic consciousness of this country
 ye nai sankhyaayein hamen aisa kuch bataati hai jo shaayad pehle nahin dekha gaya tha
 In the last two decades, India has become a unique story of economic survival and global connectivity
 duniya kii arthvyavastha main jab vikaas dar tej hoti he to bharat duniya ke mukaable zyada teji se badhata he jaisaa upie-ek ke daur main hua
 But when the world growth rate falls, India emerges from the shock quickly
 2008 main liman sankat ke ek saal baad hi bharat kii vikaas dar dobaaraa das fisadi par pahunchi
 The growth rate of the world has seen a boom in the last two years
 antarrashtriya mudra kosh (iemef) kaa akalan he ki 2018 main yah 3
 Will be 9 percent
 ek dashak baad vishwa vyapaar bhi teen fisadi kii ausat vikaas dar ko paar kar (2016 main 2
 4 percent) 4 in 2017
 7 pratishat kii gati se badha
 Had India's liberalization accelerated in the last four years, would we have crossed the 10 per cent mark? The overall growth rate of the Indian economy is no longer such a big challenge
 ab phikr un darjanon choti badi arthvyavasthaaon (kshetra, rajya, nagar) kii kerani he jo bharat ke bheetar hai
 Is this the right time to change the economic plan? The newly formed history of GDP data shows that small floors of ten percent growth rate are not enough
 desh ko lambey vakt tak das fisadi kii gati se bhaagna hoga
 It should also have 12-14 percent floors
 nirantar dhanchaagat sudhaar, sarkaar kaa chote se chote hota janaa or vikaas kaa saaf-suthra hona jaruri he
 Whether our leaders have a meaningful debate on fast development or not, they will have to continue liberalization
 yah aankade jo behad uthal-puthal bhare daur (2004-2018) ke hai, bataate hai ki siyasat ke asankhya dhatakarmon, halaat kii uthapatak or hajaar chunautiyon ke baavjood yah desh avasaron ko hasil karne or aage badaae ke tareeke jaanata he
