 Realme 3 Pro main 3

 Realme 3 Pro main do naino sim card or microesady card ko ek saath lagane ke liye slot he
 This means that there will be no need to remove another SIM card while placing the card to increase storage
 rialami 3 pro main 6
 There is a 3 inch display, there is a thin border on the side of the phone, while the border at the bottom of the phone is a bit thick
 rialami ne ipies panel kaa istemaal kiya he jo phul-echdi+ (1080x2340) rijolution or gorilla glass 5 se las he
 Vivid colors are available from the display and its viewing angles are also quite good

 Like Realme 2 Pro, Realme 3 Pro also has a notch in which the selfie camera has got a place
 front camera ke thik upar yearpis he, aapako pehle se hi screen guard laga milegaa
 Dual-camera module and capacitive fingerprint sensor have been given in the rear of Reality 3 Pro
 gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki camera modul thodaa ubhara hua he
 We used the handset without the plastic case that comes with the phone
 hafte tak phone ko istemaal karne ke baad hamane paaya ki phone ke nichle kone main thode nishaan pad gaye the
 Both the fingerprint sensor and face recognition work correctly
 retail box main headphone nahin milenge lekin rialami 3 pro (realme 3 Pro) fast charger ke saath aata he
 Realme 3 Pro Smartphone Oppo VOOC 3
 0 fast charging standard (20 wat) saport ke saath aata he
 a 4,045 mah battery has been provided to bring life to the phone

 It will provide better battery life during heavy apps such as cameras and gaming
 Realme ne rialami 3 pro ke bharat main do verient utaare hai- 4 jibi ram / 64 jibi storage verient or 6 jibi ram / 128 jibi storage verient
 We have its 6 GB RAM variant for review

 You can change the navigation key or use gestures if you want

 Apart from this, like the old coloros, you will also get many motion and screen gestures
 phone main aapako kai third-party eps pehle se pre-install milenge jaise ki webanowal (webnovel), newspoint, shairchat aadi
 But you can also uninstall them if you want
 rialami share kii madad se aap compatible Realme divaais ke bich tezi se file ko share kar sakate hai
 You will see this option when you share a file from the gallery
 hamane rialami 3 pro (realme 3 Pro) or rialami 3 (realme 3) ke bich is feechar ko istemaal karke dekha, yah feechar sahi dhang se kaam karata he
 After using Reality 3 Pro for more than a week, we found that its general performance is strong
 interphes tej he or handset multitasking ko bhi aasaani se handle kar letaa he
 The company stated that the firmware version RMX1851EX_11_A present in our review unit
 1
 0 is a pre-release version and after adding some fixes and features to the retail unit, updated software will be given
 isamen se ek mukhya fiks yah he ki phone Widevine L1 diarem certification (hamaara rivyuu unit el3 certification ke saath aata he) ke saath aayega jisaki madad se yuzar Netflix aadi eps par echdi se adhik rijolution par video ko aasaani se stream kar sakenge
 Talk about camera feature Realme 3 Pro has 960 frames per second super slow motion video recording support
 phone media plabac ko aasaani se handle kar letaa he
 The single speaker for media playback makes for a much better and louder sound although we liked the second speaker for stereo effect
 ummid thi ki rialami 3 pro main yuasabi tip-si port diya jayega lekin yah baat aapako niraash kar sakati he ki yah phone micro-yuasabi port ke saath aayega
 The heavy game also runs as if PUBG Mobile was on high graphics but despite this the phone did not slow down during gaming
 iske alaava F1 Mobile or Asphalt 9: Legends bhi smooth tareeke se chalin
 One thing that is good is that the phone does not get hot even when playing games for a long time
 Redmi Note 7 Pro kii tarah Realme 3 Pro main bada sensor nahin he
 f / 1 on the rear of Reality 3 Pro
 7 aparchar vaala 16 megapixl kaa primary soni mex519 sensor he
 The same sensor is also available in some premium smartphones such as oneplus 6T
 portate mod ke liye epa / 2
 There is a 5 megapixel depth sensor with 4 aperture
 din kii roshni main Realme 3 Pro se liye landscape shots main detail achche se capchar hui lekin hamen sharpaness kii thodi kami lagi
 The macro shots came sharp and the detail was captured well
 phone main diya eai seen rikgnishan kuch saamaanya object jaise ki phulon kii tezi se pahchaan kar letaa he
 In low light the camera especially reduces the shutter speed due to which moving subjects are not easy to capture
 jab subject ek jagah par ho to detail achche se capchar hoti hai
 Landscape shots did not look very good when shooting in auto mode and the focus was not too sharp in low light
 phone main nitscape mod bhi diya gaya he, yah ek yaa do second main shot ko capchar kar letaa he
 Sharpness and detail were also captured well in the picture
 depth sensor ez ditection ke saath milakar acha kaam karata he, kam roshni main bhi hamen aakarshak bokeh effect dekhne ko mila
 f / 2 on front panel
 0 aparchar vaala 25 megapixl kaa selfi camera he
 Photos are good when there is enough light, not only that HDR also works correctly
 lo-lite main tasviren flats or greni ain
 The Realme 3 Pro smartphone is capable of shooting videos up to 4K resolution but does not come with stabilization support
 din kii roshni main imez quality acchhee ain, raat main quality main thodi kami lagi lekin camera nois ko achche se handle kar letaa he
 The video looks stabilized at 1080p resolution

 Additional shooting modes like Time Lapse, Expert, Pano and Slo-mo are available in the camera app

 During the review, Realme 3 Pro also received a firmware update
 apadet ke saath camera ap main 960 frem prati second super slo moshan video recording saport ko joda gaya tha
 In the camera app you will get the slo-mo feature, you can choose between 120 frames per second or 960 frames per second
 haalanki, 960 frem prati second par video shoot karne ke baad jab aap use plabac karenge to yah screen par puri tarah se feet nahin hoti
 You will see black bars on the side of the video
 kul milakar paryaapt lite maujuud hone par quality acchhee ai
 The battery life of the phone is also good
 hamaare echdi video loop test main phone ne 14 ghante or 13 minute tak saath diya jo kaaphi acha he
 We used the phone as normal, like a little gaming, watching videos, chat apps and web browsing
 phone ko ek baar charge karne par yah puraa din saath nibhaataa he
 There was no significant impact on battery life even when gaming and camera were used, which is a good thing
 VOOC fast charger ek ghante main phone ko 0 se 90 pratishat charge kar detaa he joki kaaphi prabhaavshaalee he
 The thing to note is that to use VOOC charging, you have to use the micro-usb cable, the regular cable will not work
 pichley saal launch hue rialami 2 pro kii tulana main rialami 3 pro main kaaphi nae apadet kiye gaye hai
 The latest model of Realme has bigger battery, improv camera, new color variants and better processor
 Realme ne Redmi Note 7 Pro (rivyuu) se mukaable ke liye apane letest phone main kai fitures die hai
 But the Redmi Note 7 Pro has a USB type-c port, glass back panel, and AMOLED display
 agar aap 20,000 rupee se kam ke price segment main aisa smartphone chaahate hai jo gaming ke lihaaz se acha ho to rialami 3 pro (realme 3 Pro) aapke liye ek behtareen vikalp sabit ho saktaa he
 Apart from this, you will get an OS equipped with good cameras, strong battery life and features
 kuch aisi bate hai jahaan rialami 3 pro apane pratiddhandi handset Redmi Note 7 Pro se behatar he jaise ki iskaa yuai spemi nahin he or naa hi isamen heating kii samasya he
 On the other hand, due to the glass back panel, Redmi Note 7 Pro gives a slightly premium look

 tippaniyan He said that the political environment also sometimes discouraged families from revealing their identity

 In his place, Shreyas Iyer has been given the command and under his leadership the team will embark on a fresh start

 No captain has changed the fortunes of Delhi yet
 aise main ayyar team ke itihaas ke nae panne likh pate hai yaa nahin, yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga
 The biggest challenge for Iyer is to unite the team and give a balanced performance

 gujarat liance kii team ne abhi tak do mukaablen khele he or team ko apane donon hi muqablon main sharmnaak haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Where the team was defeated by kkr's team by 10 wickets in the first match, then in the second match, the team of Gatavijeta Sunrisers Hyderabad was defeated by 9 wickets
 team ko is samay apane star ol rounder rabindra jadeja kii kami khal rahi hai
 Actually Ravindra Jadeja was rested for the opening matches of the IPL, but Jadeja was forced to return due to the team's consistent poor performance
 philhal rabindra jadeja gujarat liance kii team ke saath jud chuke he
 He was strongly welcomed after joining the team
 Let's give a ROARING welcome to @royalnavghan! # Jaddu is BACK! ☺️ # roaroncemore # gamemaarichhea post shared by The Gujarat Lions (@thegujaratlions) onapr 12, 2017 at 6:41am pdtgujarawa liance ke liye jadeja kaa team se judane main phayda ho saktaa hai
 Jadeja is going through a very good form at the moment
 unke team ke saath judane se suresh raina ke kandhon se thodaa dabaav kam zarur hoga
 On Wednesday, militants hurled grenades into a hotel in the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, killing a policeman and injuring three civilians
 aadhikarik sutron ne bataaya ki maare gaye pulicekarmi kii pahchaan mohammad usoof ke rup main hui he jo masuma police stesan ke esechao ke chaalak ke rup main karyrat tha
 Three civilians injured included cameraman Rauf of a private news channel based in Delhi, who have been admitted to the hospital
 mana ja rahaa he ki aatankwaadiyon ko hotel ke bheetar gher liya gaya he jo laal chowk kshetra main aitihaasik emira kadil brij ke najadik sthit he
 Police recently claimed that there has been a reduction in terrorist violence
 dopaher baad grenade dhamaakon or andhadhundh golibari kii aawaaj suni gai jisase logon main hadakamp much gaya
 The terrorists are believed to be fidayeen
 pehle unhone platinum chowk par siarpief picket par grenade phenke or phir aparaahn lagbhag sava do baje andhadhundh golibari kii
 CRPF and police personnel deployed in the area opened fire in response
 aatankwaadiyon kii sankhya ke bare main tatkaal pataa nahin chal paaya he jinke ek hotel main chhip jane kii khabar he
 They opened fire on the security forces and hurled grenades
 ek police adhikari ne kaha ki aatankwaadiyon ke safaaye ke liye samooche kshetra ko gher liya gaya he
 Immediately after the attack, people and shopkeepers present in the area fled to safe places and traffic was stopped
 samoochaa kshetra sunsaan najar aa rahaa he or sthiti se nipatane ke liye kshetra main atirikt surakshakarmi pahunch rahe hai
 The fidayeen attack comes more than two years later
 isse pehle aatmghaatee hamalaa aktubar 2007 main dal lake kshetra main hua tha jisamen do aatankwaadi maare gaye the or teen surakshakarmi ghayal ho gaye the
 The attack comes a day after the National Conference-led coalition government completed one year
 is ek saal ke dauraan suraksha sthiti main sudhaar sarkaar kii uplabdhi rahi
 The budget session of Delhi Government has started
 8 march ko kejariwal sarkaar apana teesraa bajet pesh karegi
 The question is, what will Delhi get from Manish Sisodia's box this year? Like the previous two budgets, this time too, the government is expected to focus on education and health
 apane pichley bajet mendilli sarkaarne kul bajet kaa 16 fisadi nivesh swasthya sevaaon par kiya tha
 Amidst all the claims ranging from increasing the beds of government hospitals, 24-hour free medicine facilities and free tests, trying to provide better health facilities to the common man through mohalla clinics, there are still trips to hospitals for common manhar merge medicine Is forced
 aise main logon ko sarkaar se bajet ke naam par sirf bajet aavanton nahin balki kaam chahie
 Delhi's 10 demands
 
 
 1
 The biggest challenge of government hospitals is to manage the crowd
 darasal, aspataalon main lagaataar badhati marijon kii sankhya ko manage karte hue sarkaar ko chahie ki marij or unke timaardaaron ko sahi jaankaree uplabdh karaane ke liye aspataalon main centre banaae jaaen
 2
 dilli sarkaar aspataalon main 24 ghante anivaary dawaaen muft main uplabdh kara rahi he
 However, there are complaints from people that most of them do not get medicines from the hospital's drug delivery center
 doctor jo dawa likhte hai, wo aksar mahangi hoti he or baahar se milti he
 Some people also demanded that such medicines should be made available in government hospitals, which will provide immediate relief to the patient
 3
 The government should increase the number of beds in hospitals so that three-three patients do not have to stay on each bed
 4
 Government hospitals need to work on this after several months, even for many minor tests like ECG to X-rays
 5
 Government hospitals are still very poor in terms of cleanliness
 lihaaja sarkaar ko aspataalon main safai par khaas jor dena chahie
 6
 sarkari aspataalon ke hi doctor mohalla clinics or poli clinics main duty par jate hai
 In such a situation, the backlog of patients increases in hospitals
 sarkaar ko chahie ki zyada se zyada doctoron or nursing staff kii bhartee ko praathamikta de
 7
 gambhir beemaari se peedit marijon ko bistaron kii kami ke chalate kai baar discharge karke ghar bhej diya jaataa he
 The government should set up a special unit to take care of such patients
 8
 Along with medicines, the medical devices used in any surgery should also be made available free of cost in the hospital
 9
 Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital and Janakpuri Super Specialty Hospital should be fully operational at the earliest to reduce the burden of patients from other government hospitals
 10
 Mohalla clinics or poly clinics still do not have testing machines
 aise main kisi bhi test ke liye marijon ko bade sarkari aspataalon ke hi chakkar kaatane padate hai
 Therefore, the government should also make Mohalla clinic like a mini hospital
 taaki chote-mote test ke liye aspataalon ke chakkar naa kaatane paden
 What happened in the country, the world, the metropolis, sports, economic and Bollywood

 narendra modi kii bahucharchit hyderabad raily se pehle bijepi netaaon ne kaaryakartaaon se prati entry paanch rupee bataur tikat fees lene kii kya sochi, congress ko ek or morcha mil gaya hamale ke liye
 On Tuesday, Congress spokesperson and Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari tweeted that the market has discovered the real price of CM and it is only five rupees
 itnaa hi nahin congress ne yah bhi kaha ki modi to flop film se bhi gaye gujarey hai
 The Congress has jumped in with an all out approach over the logic and figures of Modi's Pune speech
 usee kadi main paanch rupee ke tikat ke mudde par bhi party hamalaa kar rahi he
 In the first tweet, Manish wrote that to listen to the sermons of Baba, one gets a ticket for paying money in the range of 1 lakh to 100 rupees
 box offis par flop hui filmon ke liye bhi 200 se 500 rupee tak dene hote hai
 But a ticket is available for listening to a CM for five rupees
 bazaar ne unki asli keemat khoj hi lee
 In the next tweet, Manish wrote that if BJP is charging Rs
5 per person for listening hearing, then how much ticket will be collected from 120 crores Hindus on speaking of them
 manish ne modi or bijepi ko fasivadi qaraar dete hue likhaa ki is tarah se demokrasi ko paise se naapnaa fasivadi harakat he
 Action could not be held in both houses of parliament on Monday due to the uproar by opposition parties on various issues such as black money, Assam violence, its fire in Mumbai and atrocities on Hindus in Pakistan

 Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar urged the committing members to allow the Question Hour to run and said that they should raise their issues in the Zero Hour
 lekin hangaamaa kar rahe sadsy mira kumaar ke asana tak pahunch gaye or 'kaala dhan waapas lao' or 'pakistani hinduon kii raksha karo' ke naare lagane lage
 Amid the uproar, the house was adjourned till 12 noon
 dopaher 12 baje bhi sadan main vipakshi dalon kaa hangaamaa jari rahaa jiske baad sadan kii kaarywahi do baje tak sthagit kar di gai
 When the House sat for the third time till two o'clock, Shiv Sena members raised the issue of Mumbai violence
 ve is mudde par maharashtra ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan ke istife or centre sarkaar se jawaab maang rahe the
 Anant Geete of Shiv Sena raised this matter
 congress netaa sanjay nirupam ne shiv sena kaa yah kehete hue virodh kiya ki maharashtra sarkaar har aavashyak kadam uthaa rahi he
 It may be noted that two people were killed and more than 50 people were injured in the violence in Mumbai
 shiv sadasyon kii narebaaji na thamati dekh loksabhaa upaadhyaksh kariya munda ne sadan kii kaarywahi mangalvaar tak ke liye sthagit kar di
 When the BJP raised the issue of black money in the House, then yoga guru Baba Ramdev, who was agitating on the same issue in Delhi's Ramlila Maidan, threatened to make a revolution if he did not bring back black money
 bhaajapa ne somvaar ko aupchaarik taur par ramdev ke andolan kaa samarthan karne kaa elaan kiya

 According to Shivpal, the atmosphere of the party has deteriorated due to these leaders and they have raised slogans in the meetings of big leaders, hence they cannot take them back

 There was no consensus on this matter of Akhilesh, Shivpal Yadav did not accept this condition
 teesri or aakhri shart thi amar singh, jinhen shivpal bich kaa aadmi kah rahe hai, unki bhoomika upi or yupi chunaavon main nahin hogi
 According to sources, Akhilesh could not agree on any condition, on the contrary, the party asked him to prepare for the silver jubilee and lead the election as the face of the party, which Akhilesh is not ready to accept till the time he meets the election Do not get discount
 mana ja rahaa he ki akhilesh ab mulaayam singh ke naam par bhi pighalate nahin dikh rahe or akhilesh samarthakon ne aaj baithak kar apane baagi tevar dikhaa die hai baharhaal akhilesh samarthakon ke mutabik agar akhilesh ko yun hin haashie par dhakela jaataa rahaa to akhilesh 5 november ke baad koi bada faisla le sakate hai lekin usase pehle mulaayam singh ke kunbe main ghamaasan kaa ye daur jari rahegaa
 However, Akhilesh Yadav is getting filler from other parties as the Congress is waiting for Akhilesh Yadav's big decision, Nitish Kumar has also said in gestures that if Akhilesh Himmath is there, he will support him
 saaf he ab mulaayam singh ke liye donon kheme ko sadhana kisi badi chunauti se kam nahin hoga

 a minister in the Malaysian government has given a statement regarding the controversial Muslim preacher Zakir Naik
 maanav sansaadhan mantri em
 Kulasegaran said that he would raise the issue of alleged preacher of Muslim preacher Dr Zakir Naik against Indians in Malaysia in a cabinet meeting
 darasal, jakir nike ne kaha tha ki malaysia main rahane vaale hindu malaysian pradhanmantri mahatir mohammad se zyada narendra modi ke prati vafaadaar hai
 He said that Zakir Naik has no right to criticize Malaysian affairs or interfere in local communities
 mantri ne kaha, 'jakir nike ek bahari aadmi he, ek bhagoda he or use malaysian itihaas kii bahut kam jaankaree he, isliye, use sthaneey logon ko nicha dikhaane jaisaa visheshadhikaar nahin diya janaa chahie
 The minister said that Zakir Naik's statement was not in any way a measure of being a permanent resident of Malaysia
 isliye malaysian hinduon par sawaal uthaane vaale jakir nike par ection hona chahie
 Significantly, Zakir Naik is accused in cases of inciting youth for terrorist activities and money laundering by his hate speeches in India
 bataa den ki july main jakir nike ne malaysia se waapas nahin bheje jane ke liye malaysian pradhanmantri mahatir mohammad kaa shukriya adaa kiya tha
 Earlier in January, India made a formal request to the Government of Malaysia to repatriate Zakir Naik, when the Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahatir Mohammad also supported Zakir Naik

 is video ko twitor par aplod kiya gaya he
 Where as of Tuesday morning, more than 356 people have retweeted and more than 833 'likes'
 sandip ke mahilaon ke saath ke kuch aapattijanak photo pehle hi whats ap grups par viral ho chuke hai
 Law experts say that this case is still at a basic level, without any forensic CD suspecting the authenticity, the rape charges are to be heard, in which video is viral on social media is a dangerous 'trend'
 isse sabase zyada prabhavit or ninsaphi video main najar aane vaali mahila ke saath hogi, jo kanoon kii najar main 'victim' (peedit) he
 According to experts, if Sandeep Kumar is not proved guilty, he can also file a defamation case
 is tarah ke ashleel video ko aplod karne or use ri-twit karne waalon ke khilaaf iti act kii dhara 67 ke tahat mukadmaa darj ho saktaa he, doshi sabit hone par 3 saal tak kii kaid or adhiktam paanch lakh rupee jurmaane kii sajaa ho sakati he
 If there is such a complaint, then the police will have to take action
 police khud se bhi karrwai kar sakati he, is video kaa site se delit karne ke liye police yaa sarkaar sambandhit site se request kar sakati hai
 The biggest challenge before the police in this case is to prove the authenticity of the video
 public main sibar kanoon kaa dar hone ke saath aatmasanyam hona chahie
 Public awareness is also necessary to prevent such trends
 bataa den ki isse pehle sandip kaa ek party main sharaab ke gane par jhuumane kaa video bhi viral ho chukaa he
 The recent video uploaded on Twitter has been edited and made small, but it clearly shows what has happened between him and the alleged womanwiktim
 bataa den ki yah video dekhne ke baad dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne sandip ko mantri pad se barkhaast kar diya tha
 After that (last Saturday), the woman seen in a video herself came in front of the police
 usne sandip ke khilaaf rape kaa cese darj karavaaya
 It was alleged that she had gone to Sandeep to get a ration card, but they raped her with a cold drink

 At the same time, Congress candidate Amarinder Raja Warring is appealing to both parties, that nothing has been done for this area

 If we get the answer, we will go on 12 May, but the address will go on 16 May sawaal ye ki banaras ke ganga main siyaasi dubkee lagane waalon main se koun sidhe yamuna kinare dilli main ubharegaa? or bas isiilie naa sirf ye sawaal balki banaras donon ahm ho jate hai
 Wonderful that when the election bugle was played for the 16th Lok Sabha, no one thought that the climax of the election would be like this? But let me tell you that the seat of Banaras is not just a seat
 balki isse aage bhi kuch he
 Because e Banaras hav brother
 shaam jaise hi raat kii agosh main samaati he
 Burning on the waves of the Ganges, these lamps of hopes, beliefs and vows go towards the unknown destination
 inhen dekh kar aisa lagata he maano thake-haare parindon kaa ek jhund paron ko harakat detaa hua apni manzil kii taraf badhata ja rahaa he
 Suddenly has changed Banarasamnagar has suddenly changed for the past few days
 pichley kuch dinon se yahaan sirf akidatmand hi dubkiyaan nahin laga rahe balki wo siyasatdan bhi ghote kha rahe hai jinaki tamanna he ki wo ganga main aisi dubkee lagaaein ki sidhe yamuna ke kinare dilli main hi ubharen
 That is, an attempt is being made to find a way out of Delhi from the Ghats of Benares
 yahaan ke ghaaton par wo bhi dubkee laga rahe hai jo desh ke duusare hisson se yahaan aae hai
 On the other hand the common Banarasi here
 jo is vakt do hisson main bate hue hai
 One part is very happy that a person from his city is contesting the election, in whose eyes time has given the dream of the Prime Minister
 jabaki yahaan ki local aabaadi kaa doosraa hissaa aisa he jo sochataa he ki agar narendra modi kaamyaab ho gaye to shahar kaa mizaaj bighad jayega
 The first section is assuming that if Modi succeeds and becomes the Prime Minister, then Banaras will be on the path of progress, the face of Banaras will be established
 to doosraa tabaka ye soch rahaa he ki jis chhavi ne 12 saal tak modi ko gujarat kii seemaa main baandhe rakhaa kya banaras us seemaa kii sari bandishen tod kar usee modi ko desh kaa piem bana degaa?banaras kahie
 
 
 Varanasi or Kashi
 
 
 
 But this is where Kabir stood in the market and raised his voice against the customs and traditions that dominate the religion
 zaat-paat or dharm kii buraaiyon ke khilaaf kamazoron ko apane dohon ke zarie raah dikhaai thi
 Now that time will also come in Benares that the waves of Ganga will be surprised by seeing a new wave of their own standing on the power of the political market, perhaps Kabir himself would not have even thought
 16veen loksabhaa kii angadaai lagbhag puri ho chuki he
 The wait is now on 12 May
 12 may ko banaras jo karegaa ab bas sabhi kii nazaren usee par gadi hai
 That is why the calamity is the fastest among the parties for Benaras
 magar bechaini sabase zyada bijepi main he
 Because its prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi wants to go to Delhi only through the city of Shiva
 jabaki baaki saare dal kisi bhi tarah modi kaa rasta kaatane main jute gaye hai
 Actually, the effect of the Fernas of Banaras is that politics here also holds the finger of culture
 ganga kii laharon kii tarah hi yahaan raajnneeti bhi kal-kal karti pal-pal badalati he
 If you listen to the hearts of voters here, you can clearly read the changes in power and politics in Delhi
 vaise siyaasi chaal bhale hi baranas ke votaron ko baat de lekin is nagari kii ek-duusare par nirbharta se hindu-musalmaan donon ke bich ek aisa taana-bana banataa he jo kabir kii jhini-jhini chadariyaa tak ja pahunchataa he
 This is the reason why even in the rocky valley of haters, the blooming of the rose of love has still not stopped
 alabatta ganga kinare is majboot taane-bane ke rahete hue bhi ek sawaal is shahar main jarur gum rahaa he ki aakhir narendra modi ne varanasi ko hi kyon chunaa? or kejariwal unke peeche-peeche yahaan kyon chale aae?sawaal ye bhi he ki jo log banaras main siyasat kaa sitara chamakaane aae hai kya kaashi unke raajnneetik bhagya kaa suraj chamakane degi? agar unki khoj kuch or hoti
 
 
 He would come in search of peace, if he came to calm the mind, then he would understand
 magar unki talash to varchasv kii talash he to unhen shanti kahaan se milegi? vaise is chunavi aagaaz kaa anjaam shaayad aise hi hona tha
 And that's why this is happening with Benaras
 asal main tab tak apni laharon kii tarah banaras bhi khamosh tha
 But as soon as Banaras gave the dream of giving the country a new PM from its own place, AAP also followed suit
 phir kya tha dekhte hi dekhte 543 siton main se banaras kii iklauti seat sabase alag or khaas ho gai
 So will the result here be different and special? It is the same Banaras where Hindu is not only related to Ganga but also has a very strong relationship with Muslims
 vah iske pani se vazu karata he
 Ganga also brings the message of life to him
 yahaan kii tahazeeb bismilla se shuru ho kar bhole nath ke charnon tak pahunchati he
 The weaves of Muslim weavers here adorn the idols of Hindu deities
 kaarobaari or saamaajik lihaaz se bhi hindu muslmaan donon kaa taana bana hi kabir kii jhini jhini chadariyaa tak pahunchataa he jo bhartiya samskruti kaa ek ahm rang he
 Which is situated in every Indian organ
 lekin kya yahaan bhi jab chunaav kaa vakt aayega to ye sara samjik taana bana bikhar jayega or kabir ke mullah pandit kii azaanen or ghanton kii awaazen juda ho jaaengi? siyasat ibaadat kaa rang badal degi
 
 
 So that the war of rule can be won? Will Shiva emanate from Ranjani's voice from the shehnai of Banaras Bismillah Khan? Will the politics of hate prevail over Subaras? The question is that when today's Banaras decide tomorrow, will that love of mutual love be present in their hearts? Will the Banaras love strings during the election? Taxes will weave such a thick sheet of mutual love and unity on which the whole of India is proud? Whatever happens on 12 May
 philhal to banaras par saare hindustan kii hi nahin sari duniya kii ankhen lagi hai
 And till 12 May, this city will remain in the eyes of people all over the world

 In the desire of revival in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress has now come down on experiments
 pehle jaateey samikarnon main uljhi pradesh kii raajnneeti main party kaa jhanda buland karne kii jimmedaari faijabad se saansad nirmal khatri ko saunpi gai jinka soobe main koi jaateey aadhaar nahin he
 Now the Congress high command has divided the entire state into eight zones and not only fixed their zonal in-charge, but has also given independent rights to all
 pehle se gutbaji kii shikaar congress ne ab party ke bheetar aath nae gut bana us patakatha kii shuruyaat kar di, jisamen nirmal khatri ko bich-bachaav karne vaale kii bhoomika nibhaani hogi
 When Nirmal Khatri first reached Lucknow as the state Congress president, the way the party workers clashed with each other to welcome him, it became clear that his path was full of thorns
 pradesh congress main us samay gutbaji saaf dikhaai padi, jab kaaryakartaaon kaa ek dhada manch par maujuud purv pradesh adhyaksh or kendriya mantri salmaan khurshid ke virodh main 'waapas jaao’ ke naare lagane laga
 Meanwhile, supporters of outgoing state president Rita Bahuguna Joshi and outgoing Congress Legislature Party leader Pramod Tiwari clashed
 yahi nahin, pi
 L
 punia ko tavajjo milane se khinn kendriya ispaat mantri benny prasad verma ne swaagat samaaroh se dur rahanaa hi uchit samajha
 Not only Verma, many senior party leaders are angry with their neglect despite preparing an army of in-charge in the state and are in a non-cooperation role with the newly appointed state president
 asal main pradesh main congress ab aath jone main bantakar kaam karegi
 Each zone made up of ten Lok Sabha seats will have a president and will have independent powers
 apane jone main jila, block or gram str tak ke adhyakshon ko tainaat karne kaa jimmaa jonal adhyakshon ke paas hoga
 They will have their own office and staff
 chunki ye jonal adhyaksh sidhe congress alaakaman ke sampark main rahenge, aise main pradesh adhyaksh kii bhoomika gaun ho jaaegi
 a former vice president of the state Congress says that Nirmal Khatri's role in the new format will be that of a co-ordinator among the zonal presidents of the party and they will have problems in making decisions independently
 varsh 1984 main pradesh youth congress kii kaman sanbhaalane vaale khatri ko pradesh congress kii bagdor dene ke peeche party hikeman kii yah bhi soch he ki ve puraane yuva congressiyon ko ikattha kar nae yuva netaaon ke bich sethu kaa kaam karenge
 But after he took office, Brahmin leaders like former Youth Congressmen Rajeshpati Tripathi, Madanmohan Shukla, Nekchandra Pandey, Harish Vajpayee have surrounded him, causing a lot of resentment among the other class leaders of the party
 in netaaon kaa kahana he ki khatri ko pradesh main sabhi jatiyon ko saath lekar chalanaa hoga or isaki shuruyaat unhen sabase pehle khud apane aasapaas ke logon se kerani hogi
 Not only this, it will not be easy for Khatri to stop the manner of indiscipline between party leaders and workers during the assembly elections
 udhar nivartmaan adhyaksh reeta bahuguna joshi is baat ko sweekaar karti hai ki anushaasanheenata ko rokna khatri ke liye ek badi chunauti hogi
 She says, "for many reasons i could not take strict action on matters of indiscipline within the party, the new president will have to overcome it
" ” haalanki reeta bahuguna ne un chizon par raay nahin di, jiske kaaran ve party main anushaasanheenata par sakht karrwai nahin kar pain
 Despite this, the Khatris are still claiming that they will take strong action in such cases, but it will not be easy for them to take along such independent empowered leaders
 in logon par niyantran rakhana ek abhootpurv kaam hoga or khatri yadi isamen naakaam hue to beete do saalon se qamar dard kii takalif se ubarne ke baad jald hi unhen sir dard se jujhna padegaa

 The Commission has reserved the decision
 abhi yah nahin bataaya gaya ki faisla kab sunaaya jayega, lekin ummid he ki agle kuch dinon main yah faisla aa saktaa he
 The Election Commission had summoned these mlas for final hearing on Monday
 zyaadaatar emele apane vakil ke saath ayog ke saamne pahunche
 Once again, he claimed that no legal authority was left in the matter, as the Delhi High Court has already said that ministers in Delhi cannot have parliamentary secretaries
 hoicourt ne us pad ko gaiyrkanoonee hi qaraar de diya he or ab koi sansadeey sachiv he hi nahin to phir us pad ko gaiyrkanoonee yaa laabh kaa pad kaise kaha ja saktaa, jiskaa koi vajood hi nahin he
 Let us tell you that after the Aam Aadmi Party government came to Delhi, 21 mlas were made parliamentary secretaries, which was challenged by lawyer Prashant Patel
 unhone kaha tha ki sansadeey sachiv laabh kaa pad he, isliye in sabhi emele kii sadsyta khatm honi chahie
 Regarding the decision of the High Court, he has said that this decision came in July 2016 and till then all these mlas were parliamentary secretaries
 koi faisla pichhali taarikh se lagu nahin ho saktaa
 On Monday, the Commission heard these mlas for about an hour and then informed them to keep the decision in reserve
 dilli main 9 april ko vidhansabha kaa upachunaav or 23 april ko nagar nigam ke chunaav hai
 In view of that, the Commission may stop the decision now, as it may affect these elections, but legal experts say that there is no such legal hurdle

 Just a month after the Partition in 1947, Jinnah told writer-cinematographer Margaret burke-white that "america needs Pakistan more than what America does not need for Pakistan
" '' vah rus kaa saaya tha, jisaki vajah se yah daawa ek badi ding kii bajaae sambhav baat lagane laga
 Jinnah always considered the power of an enemy better than the importance of a friend
 unki soch thi ki america soviet khatre kii baat sweekaaregaa or pakistan ise hathiyaar hasil karne ke liye tarkeeb ke taur par istemaal karegaa, jo ki jinna ke mutabik, hindustan se astitvvaadi yuddh ke liye jaruri the
 burke-white recorded the conversation in his book Halfway to Freedom, writing: "jinnah used the technique of making two enemies fear each other during the struggle for his new country

 "pakistan, which has soon abandoned the domestic policy of Jinnah to make the country a secular Muslim nation, has given great respect to Jinnah's foreign policy

 Whether there was a Democrat or a dictator in Pakistan, there was nothing to worry about for the US until both of them remained in the cold

 The first replacement of these had already taken place before the launch of the show
 disambar 2014 main shuru hue is sho kaa sabase pehla nirdesan rohit raaj goyal ne kiya
 Before this, Rohit was also directing Star Plus's second show 'diya Aur Baati'
 lekin 'tu meraa hero' ke parde par dastak dete hi rohit kii bhi chuttee kar di gai
 This is the TV debut of the lead pair of the show panchi-titu i
e
amita Khopkar and Akhilendra Mishra
 aise main mahaj chaar maheene ke bheetar darjan se zyada nirdeshkon ke aane-jane se donon ko parform karne main kaaphi takalif ho rahi he
 One of the actors of the show said, 'it is very unfortunate that 10 of our directors have changed since the start of the show
 ham har baar jab tak nae diarector ke kaam karne ke tareeke ko samaj pate hai, tab tak nayaa nirdeshak hamaare saamne rakh diya jaataa he

 a shameful incident in Raigarh district of Chhattisgarh has hurt the vision of a public welfare state
 yahi nahin aam janata ke prati prashasan kitna savendansheel he, is ghatana ne isaki bhi pole kholkar rakh di he
 The case is of Gharghoda area, where a 40-year-old man named Ramlal died due to sudden lightning strikes during strong rains
 ghatana kii jaankaree sthaneey logon ne thane main darj karai
 But when the time came to send the body to the hospital for post-mortem, neither the ambulance was there nor there was any other vehicle
 mritak ke parijan police or prashasan ke logon se guhaar lagaate rahe, lekin adhikariyon ne kabhi id kaa to kabhi ganesh utsav kaa hawala dekar apana pallaa jhaad liya
 When no vehicle was found after waiting for hours, Ramlal's family loaded his body in a rickshaw and proceeded to Ghargoda Kesarkari Hospital, nine kilometers away
 khaat par rakh waapas laae shavpostmortem ke baad bhi raamalaal ke parijanon kii musiibat kam nahi hui
 Here too, he had to wait all day for the ambulance
 police ne yah kahkar apni aupchaarikta puri kar lee kipostmortmke baad shav ko doctoron ne parijanon ko saunp diya he
 Therefore, it is the family's responsibility to fix him
 koi sahaayta nahin milane par raamalaal ke parijanon ne uske shav ko ek khatiya main daalaa or apane ghar ke liye nikal pade
 After traveling a few kilometers, this cot also broke in the middle way
 phir ek rickshaw kaa intjaam kiya gaya or shav ko ghar laayaa gaya
 His family is shocked after the sudden death of Panvaramlal who was also killed for a rickshaw
 jaise-taise unhone uskaa antim sanskaar kiya
 His family traveled the entire 9-km journey from the scene to the hospital with the dead body in a rickshaw
 jabaki postmortem ke baad yahi safar phir shuru hua
 Ramlal's body was first kept in the cot and brought to the hospital gate
 phir paidal hi paanch kilometre tak le gaye
 Meanwhile, the bed broke
 kareeb do ghante tak uske parijan rickshaw ke intjaam ke liye haath paanv maarthe rahe
 However, he got a rickshaw after a lot of struggle
 phir bachaa aath kilometre kaa safar unhone rickshaw main laash rakh tay kiya
 After the troubled wake, due to superstition in this area, no one gives his personal vehicle to take away the dead body
 is ajeebogareeb parampara ke chalate raamalaal ke parijanon kii madad ke liye koi bhi vaahan maalik saamne nahi aayaa
 After the incident, the all-around administration began to show its criticism, being active
 colector shrimati alaramel mangai di ne ek tehseeldaar ko raamalaal ke parijanon ke paas bheja or unhen das hajaar rupee kii aarthik sahaayta di
 In addition to this, four lakh rupees were given compensation as soon as possible
 yah rakam prakritik aapadaa ke dauraan peedit pariwaron ko sarkaar rajasav kanoonon ke tahat muhaiyaa karaati he
 Now the administration is busy in cleaning up
 uski daleel he ki peediton ne us tak soochna hi nahin pahunchaai
 But he has no firm answer to the fact that for the entire 22 hours, Ramlal's body was sometimes on the spot and sometimes in the hospital for an ambulance
 lekin police se lekar prashasan ke log madad ke liye aakhir kyon taiyaar nahin hue

 The ruling party loses the election despite the debt waiver and the bribes being distributed, but we know how this mass bribery has ruined and corrupted the Indian economy, budget and overall democracy
 bharat kii raajnneeti desh ke vittiya prabandhan kaa sabase bada abhishaap he
 The government, which comes after every election, imposes an indiscriminate tax for four years by declaring the treasury as empty and then in the last six months, turns the budget made of taxpayer's money or bank debt into organized bribery

 Can not our Election Commission or Supreme Court stop our governments from using budgets six months before elections on the lines of America? If this can be done then we can limit the vicious cycle in which bribes are distributed before elections and taxes are levied later

 It has been two years of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's tenure
 yogi adityanath uttar pradesh ke pehle aise siem hai jinhone pad sanbhaalane ke baad 16 maheenon main sabhi 75 jilon kaa daura puraa kar liya tha
 That was a record at that time
 iske pehle kisi bhi mukhyamantri ne aisa nahin kiya tha
 After becoming the Chief Minister on 19 March 2017, Yogi Adityanath went on a stormy tour across the state
 sarkari kaaryakramon main shaamil hote rahe, kanoon-vyavastha or vikaas kii sthiti kii samiksha karte rahe
 Yogi Adityanath not only touched 75 districts of Uttar Pradesh, but also stayed overnight in some districts
 jarurat padane par kuch jilon main kai baar daure kiye
 In the last two years, Yogi Adityanath went to Gorakhpur for one and a half dozen visits to Varanasi 8 to 10 times
 pehle mukhyamantri jinhone noida jaakar todaa andhvishwasayogi adityanath ne is andhvishwaas ko bhi todaa ki noida jane vaale mukhyamantri ko apane pad se hatana padataa he
 Due to this belief, the first few Chief Ministers avoided going to Noida, but Yogi Adityanath went to Noida
 yah manyata tab bani jab 1988 main tatkaaleen mukhyamantri vir bahadur singh noida se laute to unhen apni gaddi chhodani padi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's constituency Varanasi is also among the top priorities of Yogi Adityanath
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath modi kii varanasi yatra ke dauraan to unke saath hote hi the, lekin kai baar aisa bhi hua jab modi kaa varanasi kaa kaarykram nahin hone ke baavjood vah varanasi gaye
 Yogi Adityanath suddenly goes out The tour was admitted to a hospital in Paragiyabad
 ve achaanak hi aspataal pahunch gaye
 There was a stir among the administrative officials and officers of the hospital in Ghaziabad
 isi tarah, lakhanu ke police line or eta samet kai jilon ke skulon main auchak nirikshan karne chale gaye the
 For the first time at the Kumbh Mela, after 132 years in Prayagraj, cabinet meeting Yogi Adityanath held a cabinet meeting in Prayagraj during the Kumbh Mela
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki isse pehle prayagraj main cabinet kii baithak angrejon ke jamaane main varsh 1887 main hui thi
 The government of Yogi Adityanath successfully organized the Kumbh Mela
 aisa pehali baar hua jab yogi ke bulaave par pradhanmantri narendra modi samet unke kai mantri kumbh meley ke dauraan sangam main dubkee lagaakar gaye
 These include Smriti Irani, Nitin Gadkari and BJP President Amit Shah
 puure rajya kaa haal jaanane vaale pehle siem hai yogi adityanathyogi adityanath uttar pradesh ke pehle mukhyamantri hai jinhone puure rajya kaa haalchaal jaanane or vikaas kaaryon kii samiksha ke liye sabhi jilon kaa daura kiya
 Whereas the Chief Minister before him was more active even to a preferred area
 lekin yogi adityanath ne is myth ko todate hue apane kaarykaal ke 16 maheenon main hi 75 jilon kaa daura kar liya tha
 He visited many districts many times

 Contrary to the various systems of marriage and sexual activity prevalent in India in the past (and even today), transgression as a marital life is a relatively new experiment, the limits of which are yet to be decided
 vivaah se itar sambhogakhir, pargaman ko kaise samaj jaataa he? kya yah vivaah se itar sambhog he? is sambandh main chintaaen aksar mahilaon ke younachaar kii nigaraanee ke rup main saamne aati hai taaki prajnan kii unki shakti ko is tarah saadhaa ja sake ki hone vaali santan vansh kaa hi jaivik ansh ho or phir use bina kisi hichak ke sampatti hastantarit kii ja sake
 Stringent laws against transgression (such as Pakistan's Hadud Ordinance which holds that transgression is a crime that equates rape testimony to confession) is a violation of male property and provides for economic compensation or even death penalty
 
 bhaawanaaon ke saath vishwasghatya phir, pargaman prem athwa bhaawanaaon ke saath vishwasghaat he jisase vaivaahik sambandh khatre main pad saktaa he? masalan, film mi
 In Me and Iyer, Meenakshi and Raja share their tragedies, emotions and artistic sensibilities, and finally a kiss - with the return of her husband, a sort of guilt is seen that they are in love
 isi tarah, haal hi main ai film anuronon is baat par kendrit he ki kya sex ke bina bhi vivahetar sambandh kalankkaari ho saktaa he
 In the 2007 survey of the 'affective Infidelity' or 'affair' India today-ac nielsen-org route, when asked if 'affective Infidelity' and 'affair' were the same thing, 51 percent of participants answered yes
 is tarah kaa jawaab is tarah ke dohare bhav kii ore bhi sanket karata he ki vafadari kya vaivaahik sambandh ke prati he yaa sampatti athwa bachche ke prati
 Do 41 per cent of men and 8 per cent of women polled in a 2008 survey who have admitted that they indulge in transgressions take it for sexual intercourse or consider it to be a broad definition of sex? For centuries, men (especially elite) There has been more than one partner available for multiple marriages and sexual acts for men)

 Marriage was often seen as a means of strengthening alliances and a means of integrating new territories into their empire
 19veen sadi main bengali kuleen purush peshewar patiyon ke rup main sevaayen dete the, kai baar to ve apni ucch jati se mili haisiyat or avivaahit mahilaon ko apavitra maanane ke bhay kii aad main ek hi samay main saikadon mahilaon ko seva dete the
 There were many concubines of men outside of marriage
 ucch jati ke purush nichali jati kii mahilaon ke saath sambandh banaate the or iske liye aksar ve aanushthanik manjuuri bhi praapt kar liya karte the
 In such a scenario, women could not express their desire in view of sex
 bahupati prathadakshin asian vivaah pranaaliyon main kuch aise bhi udhaaharan hai jinamein mahilaon ke ek se adhik vyaktiyon ke saath sex kii parampara thi
 The Nyinba polyandry system is an example of this, in which brothers living at the same house were married to the same woman (or two sisters)
 nair mahilaon kaa 'sambandham vivaah' nri-shastriyon kaa ek or pansadeeda vishay he, jisamen mahila aise dher saare atithi patiyon kaa chunaav kar sakati he jo antarang sambandh sthapit karne ke baad apane ghar laut jate hai
 In both cases, there is no greater concern about biological paternity and there are clear rules that determine the offspring of a child and are recognized within the community
 na hi pargaman kaa vichaar samaan ling dhariyon ke bich yon yaa anya tarah kii antarangta ke mahatv ko spasht karata he
 Despite the lack of cross-statistics between homosexual relationships, the long literature traditions related to homosexual love in India seem to suggest that the compulsory framework of polygamous sex (and reproduction) hid other dominant or physical relationships
 kya samaan-ling vaale in sambandhon ko pargaman mana jaataa tha kyonki unase santan kii 'vaidhata' ko kisi tarah kaa khatra nahin tha? kya ab vivaahit vyaktiyon ke samalangik sambandhon ke maddenjar pargaman kii nai paribhaasha kii jarurat he jisaki vajah se vaivaahik pavitrataa kaa atikaraman ho rahaa he?hindu vivaah adhiniumsan 1955 ke hindu vivaah adhinium ne ek patnitv ko multah aadhuniktaa ke alag tarah ke maanak ke rup main sthapit kiya, jisaki kalpana upniveshi daur ke baad ke nae vishay ke rup main kii gai he
 Historians are of the opinion that new ways of thinking may be found a little earlier, in the late 19th and early 20th century narratives in which marriage was seen as fellowship and companionship within a nation
 muslim bahupatni prathndhinium beshak aise kaayadon ko un tareekon ke rup main jaahir karata he jinke jariye vaivaahik sambandhon main barabari kii kalpana kii jaati he, lekin gaiyr hindu mahilaayein is kanoonee haisiyat se alag rah gayi
 Muslim polygamy remained valid even after this, with first wives receiving mild patronage and their opinions being heard in subsequent marriages (as is the law in Bangladesh)
 abhi haal tak isai vivaah kanoon ke tahat talaak lene kii icchhuk mahilaon ko pargaman ke saath hi upeksha yaa krurta jaise atirikt kaaran bhi sabit karne padate the
 Data from the 2008 India today-ac nielsen-org Marg Sex Survey show that cultural norms associated with a wifehood are more liberal than legal standards
 8 fisadi mahilaon or 43 fisadi purushon ne mana ki ve pargaman ko uchit samajhate hai, 8 fisadi mahilaon or 41 fisadi purushon ne sweekaar kiya ki ve pargaman main lipt rahe (inamen se 27 fisadi or 19 fisadi kramshah ne saathi kii adla-badali kii baat bhi maani)
 Three percent of married men reported 'having sex with a blood relative', 16 percent of married men accepted homosexual relationships, 18 percent of married men had sex with eunuchs, and 21 percent of married men reported to prostitutes
 They agreed (54 per cent of them paid for it every now or sometimes)
 inase sambandhit vivaahit mahilaon ke aankade kramshah 1 fisadi, 6 fisadi, 6 fisadi or 2 fisadi ( 51 fisadi) hai
 However, it is not clear whether sexual relations, homosexual relationships, or sex established by giving money to relatives fall into the category of regression due to being established during marital life
 yon abhivyakti kaa tareekavaise, surveykshan ke ye aankade pargaman ke badhate ruzan kii ore ishaara nahin kar rahe hai
 It is possible to indicate to them that only marital intimacy was the only way of sexual expression neither before nor now
 mujhe surveykshan ke aankade takreeban usee samay mili the jab maine anand bazaar patrika main jivan style se sambandhit ek lekh padhaa tha jisamen us tikdi ke bare main jaankaree di gai thi jinhone vivaah kii ek ikai ke rup main rahanaa manjuur kiya thah do bahanon ne ek hi purush ke saath vivaah karnaa manjuur kiya (jinamein se ek ne kanoonee tareeke se vivaah kiya) kyonki vah younachaar, bachche paidaa karne or gharelu vyavasthaaon ke liye suvidhajanak tha
 Sexual freedom: a few days later, the same newspaper published the news about the expulsion of an aids-affected woman by her in-laws
 par is mahila ne aids se prabhavit pati kii dekharekh karne kaa faisla kiya, haalanki aids kaa mul uske pati main tha
 The woman was described as sexually independent and polluted
 is tarah kii rosemara kahaniyon ke jariye hamaara dhyaan saamaajik jivan main chhaayi bahupatnik pravritiyon or yon vividhtaon kii ore jaataa he
 And yes, as the aids-related news shows, sexually enhanced relationships are not in favor of women, and they are likely to suffer the social burden of economic burden and sexual diversity, whether it is their choice or not
 vivaah bana mahilaon ke liye aarthik surakshapichley kuch varshon ke dauraan kolkata main paariwarik adaalaton or gharelu hinsa se sambandhit meraa shodh meri is dharna kii hi pushti karata he ki upniveshi daur ke baad ke rajya main vivaah mul rup se aarthik ikai kaa gathan he
 Most of the cases are related to the lower socio-economic class of the subjects featured in the survey and economic security from marriage is usually the only means of a woman's livelihood
 patni chaahati he prem kii shartaarthik chintaaon main shahari awasaiya jagah ko sulabh karaane kii kshamta, vistaarit parivaar main sansadhano va adhikaron kii saajhedaari, patni ke parivaar kii vittiya jimmedaariyaan or patni kii simit aay shaamil hai
 Marital fidelity is a condition of this bond: with wives being accused on premarital relationships or existing relationships (as Flavia Aigens noted in the India Today 2007 survey article), they are treated appropriately in joint families
 Accusations of not doing, domestically unapproachable or having an unknown source of income are common
 patniyaan aksar aarope lagaati hai ki pati yon yaa bhavatmak sambandhon main (parivaar ke sadasyon yaa padosiyon ke saath) lipt hai lekin ve vaivaahik jivan main jagah dene ke saath use sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye prem kii shart rakhti hai
 Wandering steps In the 20th century, even though matrimonial laws made married couples such that they were the only partners in each other in terms of sex, love and intimacy, but neither marriage nor sexual behavior was consistent with a wifehood

 rajyasabha kii kaarywahi anischitkaal ke liye sthagit kar di gai he
 Along with this, many important bills like the triple talaq and citizenship amendment bill to be brought by the Modi government will now have to wait for the formation of the 17th Lok Sabha for the approval of Parliament
 loksabhaa se yah donon hi bill paarit ho chuke hai lekin inhen ucch sadan main pesh nahin kiya ja sakaa, aise main ab teen talaak or naagarikta sanshodhan bill radd maane jaaenge or inhen phir se donon sadanon kii manjuuri dilaani hogi

 The 12th results of Bihar Board were declared on Tuesday, in which 64% children failed
 behad kharaab rigelt aane ke baad ek baar phir bihar bort kii pariksha vyavastha ko lekar sawaal uthne lage hai
 If the government is telling it as the result of ban on copying, then the opposition is telling the failure of Nitish government
 bihar ke shiksha mantri ashok choudhary ne kaha he ki pichley 10 saal bihar main nakal se paas hone par lagaam lagi he, jiske chalate rigelt main giravat ai he
 However, he admitted that this time the 12th class result was less than he had expected
 lekin unhen aise rigelt kaa anumaan tha
 If the ban on copying was done, the result fell
 Education Minister Ashok Chaudhary also questioned the examination system that had been going on since last years
 unhone kaha ki bihar main nakal se paas hone kaa pattern rahaa he
 Which our government has banned

 reliance group ke chairman anil ambani ne ek intervyuu main khulaasa kiya ki jab ek kaarobaari karj main duubataa he, to log uske saath kaisaa bartaav karte hai
 2017 was a difficult year for Anil Ambani, it was very difficult for Anil Ambani due to the debt of 45 thousand crore rupees
 is dauraan vah apane jivan ke bure daur se gujarey
 Anil spoke about this in an interview to Economic Times
 is dauraan unhone apane mushkil daur ke bare main baat kii or bataaya ki unke saath is dauraan kaisaa vyavhaar kiya gaya
 Anil said, 'anil doesn't pick up the phone': In 2017, there has been a time in his life when people stopped picking up his phone
 unke mushkil daur main logon ne unase duuri bana lee thi
 In the interview, Anil Ambani said that 2017 was very difficult for him
 unhen kai tarah kii chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 His bad times began after he got caught in the 2G case
 'log mere saath dikhnaa nahin chaahate the'anil ne kaha, ''is dauraan sirf chand log hi mere saath khadey the
 During this time people did not pick up my phone
 waapas kol bhi nahin karte the
 Some people even started showing up with me
 ve mujhase sampark bhi nahin karnaa chaahate the
 "the chairman of Reliance Group said," These circumstances only tell you who are your friends and who are against you
 isi dauraan aapako pataa chalata he ki koun se log aap se duuri banane ke liye jhuthe bahaane kar rahe hai
 "mourning the father", Anil told in an interview that if he spoke to his father Dhirubhai Ambani about this situation, his reply would have been encouraging
 ''wo meri taraf dekhte or bolte, tum hairaan kyon ho
 This is called the fabrication of steel

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf loksabhaa chunaav se pehle vipakshi dalon ko ekajute karne kaa prayaas lambey samay se kiya ja rahaa tha, haalanki is disha main koi thos kamyaabi nahin mili or kai jatke lagate rahe
 But Fire Brand Leader Mamata Banerjee made this impossible-to-do task possible and for the first time, pitted opposition leaders from every corner of the country on one platform against Narendra Modi
 loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle vipakshi dalon kii ekajutata dikhaane ke liye pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee kolkata ke brigade ground main united india raily ke aayojan kii taiyaari lambey samay se kar rahi thim
 By gathering the leaders of 23 to 26 opposition parties on one platform on Saturday, Mamata proved that she has the ability to challenge Narendra Modi and the next election is not going to be unilateral
 pradhanmantri modi or bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke khilaaf yojit kii gai vipakshi dalon kii is raily main vipakshi dalon kaa jamaavada dikhaa or unhone ek tarah se chunavi bigul bajaate hue apni ekajutata dikhaai or yah jataane kii koshish kii, ki unamem koi matbhed nahin he
 Opposition parties are committed and united to remove Modi and his government
 raily main mamata banerjee ne ‘badal do, badal do, dilli kii sarkaar badal do’ kaa naaraa bhi diya
 On the question of joint opposition prime ministerial candidate from BJP, he said that opposition parties promise to work together and the decision on who will be the prime minister will be taken during the Lok Sabha elections
 'matbhed thik manabhed nahin thik'mamata banerjee kii is raily main bhaag lene aae bijepi ke baagi saansad shatrughna sinha ne bhi kaha ki yah samay ek hone kaa he
 We may have differences, but there should be no discrimination
 rashtriya janata dal ke netaa tejasvi yadav ne bhi kaha ki desh main satta badalane ke liye sabhi ko ekajute hona padegaa
 Dalit leader and MLA Jignesh Mevani also said that the coming together of many opposition parties in this TMC rally is a message of change in the next Lok Sabha election
 bijepi ke ek or baagi netaa or purv kendriya mantri yashavanth sinha ne bhi sabhi vipakshi guton ko ekajute hone kii baat karte hue kaha ki vah umr ke is padaav par ab kuch nahin chaahate, lekin unka lakshya modi sarkaar ko satta se baahar karne kaa he, jiske liye puure vipaksh ko ekajute hona hoga
 He also advised that all opposition parties have to unite and field a candidate against the BJP, so that the NDA can be thrown out of power
 raily main 9 purv kendriya mantri bhimmata ke anusaar, is raily main kareeb 23-26 vipakshi dalon ke netaa shaamil hue
 Former Prime Minister and Janata Dal Secular (JDS) leader HD Deve Gowda, besides Mamata Banerjee, Chief Ministers of 4 states Chandrababu Naidu (TDP), HD Kumaraswamy (JDS) and Arvind Kejriwal (AAP) also joined
 inke alaava chah purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav (samaajawaadee party), faruk abdulla or umr abdulla (neshnal conference), babulal marandi (jharkhand vikaas morcha), hemanth sorain (jharkhand mukti morcha) or kuch din pehle bijepi chhodane vaale gegang apang bhi raily main hissaa lene pahunche
 9 former Union ministers also participated in this rally of opposition parties
 mallikargen khadge or abhishek manu singhvi (congress), ajit singh (rashtriya lok dal), sharad pavaar (rashtravaadi congress party), sharad yadav (loktantric janata dal) ke alaava bijepi ke 3 baagi netaa yashavanth sinha, arun shouri or shatrughna sinha ke saath-saath ram jethmalani ne bhi hissaa liya
 Apart from these, RJD leader and former Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav, Satish Chandra Mishra as the representative of BSP supremo Mayawati, Patidar reservation movement leader Hardik Patel and Dalit leader MLA Jignesh Mevani also appeared on the stage
 mamata ke alaava kai anya gut bhi apane str par vipakshi dalon ko saath laane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The Congress also wants to form a grand alliance, but it suffered a setback in its campaign when the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party formed an alliance in Uttar Pradesh without talking to the Congress
 is gathbandhan ke baad bihar main mahagathbandhan par bhi sankat main badal mandaraane lage hai, jisamen argedy or congress samet kuch chote dal shaamil hai
 At the same time, Telangana Chief Minister k Chandrasekhar Rao is also trying to unite opposition parties against Modi
 aise main mamata ne apane garh main deshbhar ke kai vipakshi netaaon ko bulaakar yah sabit kar diya ki unke paas vipakshi dalon ko ekasaath lekar chalane kaa madda he
 However, it is not easy to say how strong it is and how many days it can go together in the days ahead
 philhal is ekajutata raily ne nishchit taur par pradhanmantri narendra modi or endie ko sochane ke liye majaboor kar diya hoga

 But the Rajasthan government claims that Rajasthan is not spreading pollution in Delhi, but Delhi itself is polluting Rajasthan
 darasal dilli sarkaar ne engiti ke saamne punjab, haryana ke saath-saath rajasthan ko bhi kheton main parali jalaane se pradooshan ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya tha
 For this, the environment secretary of four states including Rajasthan has been summoned on 8 November in Delhi MGT
 iske jawaab main rajasthan sarkaar ne kaha he kisaaf-suthrihava vaala rajya rajasthan dilli kii vajah se pradooshit hota ja rahaa he
 The Rajasthan government claims that very few fields in Rajasthan have an incident of crop burning and the wind is not blowing anyway
 aise main dilli sarkaar ke rajasthan par pradooshan fisane ke aropbebuniyaadahai
 The reason for this is that vehicles which have been rejected in Delhi are being registered in RTO-DTO offices in Rajasthan
 dilli main euro 3 ke vaahanon ke registration par pabandi lagi to vahaan se pados ke ilaake alvar, kotputli, dausa, shahpura or nimrapha main do lakh se zyada euro 3 ke vaahanon kaa registration karaayaa ja chukaa he
 It is clear that cheap and polluting old vehicles rejected from Delhi are being destroyed here
 akele kothputli main ek lakh 30 hajaar dilli euro 3 vaahanon kaa registration karavaaya ja chukaa he
 In this regard, Transport Minister Yunus Khan says that this is correct and an exercise is underway to enact a law to prevent this
 dilli main paryaavaran sachivon kii engiti kii meeting main isbaat ko rakhaa jayega ki dilli ke rejected vaahanon ko duusare rajyon main khapaane ke bajaae nasht karne ke upaay kiye jaaen
 Meanwhile, in view of the deteriorating condition of pollution in Delhi, the Rajasthan government has also called a meeting on Monday
 jisamen is baat par charchaa hogi ki agle das bees saalon main dilli jaise halaat jaipur jaise shaharon main na ho
 For this, a master plan will be made with all departments from now on

 a similar story is of cricketer Papu Rai who started playing cricket for the roti of June 2 and has now been selected in the India c team for the Devdhar Trophy
 cricket khilne ke dauraan spinner papu kii gendbaaji se tay hota tha ki uncapetki bhukh mitegi yaa nahin
 The 23-year-old bowler has been selected for the Deodhar Trophy in the India c team led by Ajinkya Rahane but the Kolkata boy's story is quite painful
 papu ne bachapan main hi apane mata-pita ko kho diya tha
 Papu, who was selected for the Deodhar Trophy after performing well in the Vijay Hazare Trophy on behalf of his new state of Odisha, recalled his old days when every wicket meant he would get a good afternoon and night
 muflisi main beetaa bachapanpapu ne apane mushkil bhare dinon ko yaad karte hue agency se kaha, ‘bhaiya log bulaate the or bolte the ki ball daalega to khaanaa khilaaungaa or har wicket kaa 10 rupee dete the
 'his parents were residents of Bihar who had come to Bengal to earn
 papu ne apane pita jamaadaar raay or parvati devi ko tabhi ganvaa diya tha jabaki vah navjaat the
 His father was a truck driver and died of a heart attack while his mother died after a long illness
 papu ke mata-pita bihar ke saaran jile main chhapra se 41 kimi dur sthit khajuri gaanv ke rahane vaale the tathaa kaam ke liye kolkata aa gayi the
 He is only so knowledgeable about his parents
 kolkata ke picnic garden main kiraaye par rahane vaale papu ne kaha ki unako kabhi dekha nahin, kabhi gaanv nahin gaya, maine unke bare main sirf suna he
 Papu tells that i wish he would have been alive to see me playing on behalf of Bharat c today
 main kal puri raat nahin so paaya or rota rahaa
 i feel that my hard work of the past several years is now bearing fruit
 mata-pita kii maut ke baad papu ke chachaa or chachee unki dekhbhaal karne lage lekin jald hi unke majdoor chachaa bhi chal based
 After this, it became difficult for this 15-year-old teenager to get one time meal
 lekin cricket se unhen nayaa jivan mila
 He first started as a fast bowler but Howrah Cricket Academy coach Sujit Saha advised him to bowl spin with his left hand
 vah 2011 main bengal cricket sangh kii second divijan lig main sarvaadhik wicket lene vaale gendbaaj the
 He then took 50 wickets from Dalhousie's side
 lekin tab iresh saxena bengal kii taraf se khelaa karte the or baad main pragyan ojha ke aane se unhen bengal team main jagah nahin mili
 In search of stomach hunger and cricket food and home, Papu came to Jajpur, 100 km northeast of Bhubaneswar
 papu ne kaha, ‘mere dost (mujakir ali khan or asif ikbaal khan) jinase main yahaan mila, unhone mujhase kaha ki ve mujhe bhojan or chat muhaiyaa karaayenge
 In this way Odisha became my home
 ’papu ne 2015 main odisha under-15 team main jagah mili
 Three years later, Papu reached the senior team and took 14 wickets in eight matches of List a for Odisha
 ab vah devdhar trophy main khilne ke liye utsahit hai
 He said that hopefully i will get a chance and i will do my best, this will give me a lot to learn

 bataa den, chanu kaa janm manipur kii rajdhani imphal main 8 agast 1994 ko paidaa hua
 His full name is 'sykhom Meerabai Chanu'
 unki umr 23 saal he
 Even though today she has brightened the name of the country by getting gold from Chanu but there was a time when she wanted to leave the world of sports
 bibisi kii report ke anusaar ek samay tha jab chanu depressant main chali gayi thi or unhen har hafte manovaigyanik ke seshan lene padate the
 She became the second Indian to win a gold medal after Karnam Malleswari at the 2016 World Championships
 jiske baad vah kaaphi hataash thi
 It took me a long time to overcome this disappointment
 media report kii maane to us dauraan chanu ne khel ko alavida kehane kaa man bana liya tha
 But he did not give up and then made a tremendous comeback in the world of sports
 vahiin aaj gold jeetne ke baad unke man ko tasalli mili jiskaa dard vah 2016 se jhel rahi thim
 CWG 2018: Meerabai Chanu gave India the first gold in weightlifting
 Let me tell you, Meerabai Chanu is the first Indian to win a gold medal in the weightlifting world championship in more than two decades
 jahaan unhone sntch main 85 kilo or clin and jerk main 109 kilo vajan uthaaya tha
 He set a new national record by lifting a total weight of 194 kg in the 48 kg category
 (world vetalifting championships main gold medal jeetne ke dauraan kii tasviir)bataa den
 Meerabai was very skilled since childhood
 vetalifting main bachapan se unhen khaas suvidhaayen nahin mili thi lekin unka junun or buland hausala gold jeetne ke liye kaaphi he
 On the other hand, if they talk about their hobby, they like to dance
 saath hi unke pasandida abhinayta salmaan khan he
 With such hard training, Meerabai Chanu became a 'GOLD' Medalist, who used to do such training as Meera is from the village where there was no training center
 isliye training karne ke liye vah 50-60 kilometre dur jaaya karti thim
 As a sportsman, he needed milk and chicken daily in the diet, but it was extremely difficult for Chanu, who belongs to a middle family

 If sources are to be believed, SP may declare former minister Kiranpal Kashyap from Kairana Lok Sabha seat and Naimul Hasan from Nurpur assembly seat as its candidate
 kairana ke congress kaaryakartaaon ne dilli alaakaman ko sanket die hai, ki vah sapa ke saath jane kii bajaay rashtriya lok dal ko samarthan karnaa chaahate hai
 On the other hand, trusted sources of RLD say that they need a day or two to take a final decision on the candidate for Kairana seat
 sutron ke mutabikareldi vipakshi ektako banaae rakhane ke liye kairana seat chhod sakati he
 But the SP promised that in 2019 they will be given proper seats
 areldi kairana loksabhaa seat kii bajaay nurpur vidhansabha seat par zyada dilchaspee le rahi he
 However, the ticket decision on these seats will come only after negotiations between SP and RLD
 congress jayant ko kar sakati he samarthanupi congress ke upaadhyaksh imran masood pehle hi sanket de chuke hai ki agar jayant choudhary chunaav maidan main utarate hai to ham areldi kaa samarthan karne ke liye bhi taiyaar hai
 Congress has a strong position in three of the five assembly segments
 vidhansabha chunaav kaa samikarnakairana loksabhaa seat ke tahat paanch vidhansabha siten aati hai
 This Lok Sabha seat consists of Thanabhavan, Kairana and Shamli assembly seats in Shamli district, Gangoh and Nakur assembly seats in Saharanpur district
 maujuuda samay main in paanch vidhansabha siton main chaar bijepi ke paas hai or kairana vidhansabha seat sapa ke paas he
 The BJP received 4 lakh 33 thousand votes in these seats in 2017
 jabaki basapa pratyaashiyon ko 2 lakh 8 hajaar or sapa ke 3 pratyaashiyon ko 1 lakh 6 hajaar vot mili the
 The SP gave Shamli and Nakur seats to the Congress
 kairana loksabhaa kii siyasat itihascarana loksabhaa seat 1962 main vajood main ai
 Since then elections have been held 14 times
 inamen congress or bijepi do-do baar chunaav jeet saki hai
 These seats have been going into the account of different political parties
 kairana loksabhaa seat par pehali baar hue chunaav main nirdaleey ummidavaar ke taur par yashpal singh ne jeet darj kii thi
 Socialist Party in 1967, Congress in 1971, Janata Party in 1977, Janata Party (secular) in 1980, Congress in 1984, Congress in 1989, 1991, SP in 1996, BJP in 1998, Rashtriya Lok Dal in 1999 and 2004, BSP in 2009 And in 2014, BJP has won
 kairana kaa jaateey samikarnakairana loksabhaa seat par 17 lakh matadaata hai jinamein paanch lakh muslim, chaar lakh becoward (jat, gurjar, saini, kashyap, prajapati or anya shaamil) or dedh lakh vot jatav dalit he or 1 lakh ke kareeb gairjatav dalit matadaata hai
 The Kairana seat is considered to be Gurjar-dominated
 yahaan teen lakh gurjar matadaata hai inamen hindu-muslim donon gurjar shaamil hai
 That is why the candidates of Gurjar community have won this seat most of the times
 kairana main muslim siyasatkairana main muslim aabaadi acchhee khaasi hone ke baad bhi 14 loksabhaa chunaav main mahaj 4 baar hi muslim saansad bane hai
 There were two Muslim candidates against Hukum Singh of BJP in the 2014 election
 sapa ne nahid hasan ko or basapa ne kanvar hasan ko utaara tha
 In 2013, the Muzaffarnagar riots led to polarization of votes and Hukum Singh benefited from the Muslim vote split due to the presence of two Muslim candidates
 voton kaa sameekarnabijapi ko 5 lakh 65 hajaar 909 vot mili the
 While SP 3 lakh 29 thousand 81 votes and BSP 1 lakh 60 thousand 414 votes
 aise main agar sapa-basapa ke vot jod liye jaaen to bhi bijepi aage he
 But the story of 2014 and 2018 is different
 2017 main agar sapa-basapa ko mili vot dekhe jaaen or uske hisaab se upachunaav kaa andaja lagaaya jaae to sapa-basapa kii dosti, bijepi par baari pad sakati he
 What will happen if this happens, the original vote of the SP in Kairana is low, but the population of Muslims is large, which is considered as the vote bank of the SP
 jabaki isi seat par dalit vot kaaphi ahm hai
 Like the previous by-elections of UP, if the bsp's vote goes to the sp's seat, then there can be difficulties for the BJP
 jabaki bijepi ek baar apane maton ko ekajute karke 2014 jaisaa itihaas dohraane kii koshish karegi

 In the Aam Aadmi Party MP, Sanjay singhnarafel dealmamle has once again asked questions to the Modi government
 supreme courtdwara 10 din ke bheetar rafel se judi jaankaree maangane ke baad buudhvaar ko ek press conference ke dauraan 'aap' saansad ne agenciyon ko bheji gai shikayaton kaa zikr kiya
 He asked what are the compulsions due to which the central government does not want to let the Rafale deal be investigated? Also, all those who are petitioners in this case have also been asked to provide this information to all of them
 aam aadmi party pehle bhi aarope laga chuki he ki modi sarkaar rafel deal maamle main shuru se jhooth bolti aa rahi he
 According to the party leaders, where the Union Defense Minister on one hand says that the information about the price of Rafale is an issue related to the security of the country, that is why we cannot tell the price of Rafael
 vahiin, unke saansad or mantri subhash bhamare badi aasaani se rafel kii keemat bataa dete hai
 Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh has claimed that Minister Subhash Bhamre has also lied about the price of Rafael
 sanjay singh ne kaha tha ki subhash bhamare anya saansadon ke prashn kaa jawaab dete hue rafel kii keemat 526 crores sabhi icupment ke saath bataai
 At the same time, while answering my question, the price of the same Rafale ship was Rs 526 crore with no equipment
 sanjay singh ne press conference ke dauraan bataaya ki 6 march koam aadmi partike teenon saansadon ne CVC ke chairman ko, mukhya satarkta ayog ko or 12 march 2018 ko sibiai diarector se milakar rafel deal main hue maha ghotaale kii jaanch kii maang kii thi
 After this, on 16 May 2018, CVC replied that your complaint is accepted
 sanjay singh ne kaha modi sarkaar ko jawaab dena hoga ki kyon unhone saalon puraani anubhav vaali company se ye project waapas lekar 12 din puraani reliance kii company ko ye project dilaayaa
 How did the aircraft worth 526 crore become 1670 crore? AAP MP Sanjay Singh has also questioned the CBI controversy
 singh ne aarope lagaaya ki rafel deal main hue ghotaale kii jaanch alok verma kii nigaraanee main hone vaali thi, isiilie modi sarkaar ne aanan fanan main alok verma ko pad se hataakar, unki jagah par nageshwar raav jaise vyakti ko sibiai diarector ke pad par baitha diya, jis par pehle se hi bhrashtachar ke sangeen aarope lage hai or uske bhrashtachar kii jaanch chal rahi he

 In the very first week, two such films came which got more discussion in the corridors of politics than box office
 pehali da accidental prime ministar or duusari uri- da sargical strike
 Talking about Uri film, the film is flagging at the box office
 film main sabhi kalakaaron ke kaam kii tarif ho rahi he or film main jis deshbhakti ke josh ko dikhaaya gaya he use darshakon ne bhi saraahaa he
 Apart from this, there is another thing in this film which caught the attention of the people in the movie theater
 wo he film main netaaon kaa role
 After the 2016 Uri attack, the film on the surgical strike by entering into Pakistan's house tells the whole operation process
 jaahir he ki isamen sarkaar kaa nirnay bhi ahm tha, isliye film main bhi kai netaaon ko dikhaaya gaya he
 The film features the protagonists of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar (then), Finance Minister Arun Jaitley
 film ke dauraan jaise hi netaaon ke kirdaar kii entry hoti he, to darshakon kaa josh dekhte hi banataa he
 At every entry, the atmosphere of the theater resonates with whistles and applause
 lekin film main kis netaa kaa kirdaar kaisaa dikhaaya gaya he
 Read here 
 
 pradhanmantri narendra modi:film main pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa kirdaar rajit kapur ne nibhaayaa he
 As soon as his entry is in the film, the audience starts shouting modi-modi slogans in the theater and the characters are welcomed with seats
 pradhanmantri ke kirdaar ko puri film main gambhir dikhaaya gaya he, jo kam bol rahaa he lekin jab bhi bol rahaa he to nirnaayak shabdon main apni baat kah rahaa he
 The most important scene of this character comes when the success of the surgical strike is confirmed in the film, then the public sitting in the theater, shouting a sigh of relief, starts shouting "56 inch"
 NSA ajit dobhaal:film kaa sabase ahm kirdaar paresh rawal ne nibhaayaa he, NSA ajit dobhaal kaa role
 The film begins with the success of a surgical strike near the Myanmar border, from where Ajit Doval's mindgame is shown
 ye kirdaar puri tarah se dimagi kasarat se bharpoor he, jo kathin faisle lene se nahin dar rahaa he or sena ke javaanon ko puraa bharosa de rahaa he
 Ajit Doval's annoyance during the growing terror attacks between 2015 and 2016 and making new preparations in response to the audience
 is kirdaar ne bhi darshakon ko khub hansaaya, jab apni har phone kol ke baad paresh rawal apana phone todate hue najar aae
 And his colleague immediately gave a new phone, people were seen hooting here
 ajit dobhaal ke kirdaar ko govind bharadwaj kaa naam diya hua he
 (photo tweeted by the viewer) Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar: Yogesh Somen who plays the country's Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar during the surgical strike looks exactly like him
 unka kirdaar sirf media se mukhaatib hota hua, baithkon main hissaa lete hua hi najar aayaa
 Most of the time, the decisions of the NSA-PM characters were taken
 aise main luk ke maamle main ye kirdaar logon ko pasand aayaa
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh: In the meeting called by the Prime Minister after the Uri attack, when asked how to give a strong reply to Pakistan
 sabhi apane-apane vichaar rakh rahe the, lekin jab rajnath kaa jawaab aayaa to theatre tahaakon se gunj uthaa
 Actually, the answer was that we stop the water going into Pakistan, this will trouble them with the loc and stop the infiltration
 itnaa kehane bhar kii deree thi ki theatre main baithe logon ne sitiyaan or taaliyaan bajaanaa shuru kar diya
 And a conversation began in the audience about the harsh condemnation for each attack
 iske alaava bhi kuch netaaon, adhikariyon or sena ke afasaron ke kirdaaron ko behad bakhubi se nibhaayaa gaya he, jo darshakon ko kaaphi pasand aayaa
 While watching the film, you will also experience the india-pakistan match, where applause and whistles are played on every fours and sixes
 bas yahaan antar itnaa he ki theatre main har aatanki ke maare jane par sitiyaan bajati hai or samay-samay par bharat mata kii jai or vande maataram ke naare bhi theatre main goonjte hai
 In the end
 
 
 How's The josh?high Sir

 kitni hi baar aisa hua hoga ki fasebuk massenger main kisi galat group main koi achaanak hi massej kar die hon, yaa kabhi aisa hua hoga ki kisi massej main koi galati chali gai ho, yaa kabhi aisa bhi hua hoga ki aap massenger main massej bhejne ke baad use waapas lenaa chaah rahe hon
 Till now there was no option to rectify these mistakes in Facebook Messenger, but now Facebook has given a special feature in its Messenger, which allows you to withdraw or delete your sent message
 aapako yaad hoga ki pichley saal watsap main bhi aisa hi feechar diya gaya tha
 Here this feature was given the name Delete for Everyone
 yahaan bhi aap bheje gaye massej ko delit kar sakate hai
 But the difference here is that while the time to delete the message sent in whatsapp's Delete for Everyone feature is 1 hour, in Facebook Messenger, this time is just 10 minutes
 yani aapako keval 10 minute ke andar hi mainsejar main bheje gaye massej ko delit karnaa hoga
 Messenger Product Manager, Anna Isikkien wrote in a blog post - It is simple to use the Unsend feature
 yadi aap koi massej delit karnaa chaahate hai to aapako 'remov for evarivan' opshan ko select karnaa hoga
 As soon as the message is removed, an alert text will appear here
 massej bheje jane ke baad use delit karne ke liye aapke paas keval 10 minute kaa vakt hoga
 On the other hand, if you want to delete the message for yourself, you can do this at any time
 iske liye aapako 'remov for you' kaa opshan select karnaa hoga
 But remember, by selecting this option, you will be able to select the message for yourself, the rest of the people in the group will still be able to see the message
 fasebuk massenger main delit for evarivan feechar ko duniyabar ke android or ios yugers ke liye jari kar diya gaya he
 If you want to use it, update your messenger

 co / lc5bomf7o2 — Mithali Raj (@ m_raj03) August 20, 2017 chini mudra yuan main avamulyan kaa bharat ke kapadaa or paridhaan niryaat par vipareet asar padegaa
 India is already experiencing slow growth due to softening in global markets
 texprosil ke chairmanar ke daalamia ne ek bayaan main kaha, 'china dwaara achaanak apni mudra yuan kaa avamulyan kiye jane se desh ke kapadaa or paridhaan niryaat par vipareet prabhaav padegaa jo vaishvik bazaaron main narmi ke kaaran pehle se dhimi vruddhi dar kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 'significantly, China's central bank depreciated 2 percent in its currency on Tuesday
 vaishvik niryaat main giravat ho rahi he
 The reduction in global demand has put pressure on the export-oriented Chinese economy
 daalamia ne kaha ki chini sarkaar, bharat sarkaar kii tulana main apane niryaat main giravat ko lekar zyada samvedshansheel he kyonki usne apane niryaat main giravat ko thaamne ke liye furti ke saath kaam kiya or apni mudra main avamulyan kiya
 Dalmiyan, on the other hand, said that our government has failed to take corrective steps to stop the decline in exports
 kendriya pratyaksh kar board (sibiditi) pramukh ne kaha he ki sirf aadhaar ke jariye iskar ritern daakhil karne vaale vyakti ko nayi vyavastha ke tahat iskar vibhaag khud hi ek pan jari kar degaa
 Actually, it has been proposed in the budget that only biometric identification card is sufficient for this work
 yah nayi vyavastha dono database (aadhaar or pan) ko jodne ke liye kii gai he
 CBDT Chairman Pramod Chandra Modi said that the usefulness of PAN (permanent Account Number) is definitely not over and in the recent budget, the two databases (PAN and Aadhaar) are said to be identical for using each other instead of one
 There is an additional facility that will ensure they are added, which is now mandatory under the law
 unhone pitiai bhashaa ko die ek saakshaatkaar main kaha, 'aise maamalon main jahaan aadhaar kaa sandarbh diya ja rahaa he or vahaan pan kaa ullekh nahin he, vahaan ham (iskar ritern jamaa karne vaale) vyakti ko pan aavantit karne kii sambhaavna ke bare main soch sakate hai
 In fact, the CBDT chief was asked whether the PAN issued by the Income Tax (IT) department would cease to exist after the provision made in the budget speech of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman
 unhone kaha, 'yah is mudde ko galat tareeke se dekha janaa he
 Certainly the usefulness of the pan is not ending
 pan kii upyogita bani rahegi
 It is an attempt to provide additional facilities to the income tax depositors that the process of filing income tax returns should not be affected if it is not mentioning PAN and has only Aadhaar
 ' unhone kaha ki vibhaag ke akalan karne vaale adhikari pan aavantit karne kii apni shakti kaa istemaal karenge
 The CBDT chief said, "there is a provision in the law that the Assessing Officer can allot PAN himself
 isliye, yadi bina pan ke aadhaar kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he to main unhen pan jari karuunga or ve aapas main jud jaaenge
 The CBDT chief said that linking the two databases is now necessary and it is also provided in law

 marathi film 'sarat' kai hafte pehle hi aa chuki he or maharashtra ke tamaam shaharon kasbon main koob dekhi ja rahi he
 The film is made in Marathi but the language of this film is not Marathi
 'sarat' kaamyaab ho gai he, kai karod kama liye hai phir bhi kaamyaab film nahin he kyonki isaki kahani hamaari aapaki sabhi kii naakaami kii kahani he
 We are going up the stairs of injustice
 jo sabase oonche paaydaan par he wo kaamyaab nazar aata he jo nichle paaydaan par he ko naakaam
 Friday is not the day that 24 hours before Mumbai, Star Man artists and journalists start coming to Delhi
 puri team dopaher do baje se lekar raat ke das baje tak dilli dilli gum kar channel channel naap detii he or aapaki shaam film film kar detii he
 Their answers have been typed and typed for ten years
 yani ki role chalanging tha, idia new he
 Star is very cooperative and the director is like a buddy who gives a lot of space, it's a fun to work with him
 honor for me tu work vid him
 Very original, creative, heroin is asked separately what kind of working relationship you have with this hero, if you want to revolutionize the interview many times, it is called that the female actor gets less money
 uske baad sab saamaanya ho jaataa he
 i could even say this much in one word which we call promotion
 isliye maine kaha ki 'sarat' par tab baat karne ja rahaa hum jab film ko relies hue kai hafte ho gaye hai
 i have seen the film
 'harishchandrachi factory', 'elizabeth ekadshi', 'court', 'fandry' or ab 'sarat'
 Is Marathi cinema going through a new phase? jahaan baat fund or vitaran kii nahin ho rahi he
 The story and character have started happening
 vishnu khare ke shabdon main marathi cinema kii bahu ayamiya astima kaa ek nayaa total skool viksit hone laga he
 In 2009, 'harish Chandrachi Factory' came
 paresh mokashi kii is film kii kaaphi charchaa hui thi
 The film has received the National Award for Best Feature Film in Marathi
 2009 main ise shreshth videshi bhashaa kii film kii shrenee main bharat se bheja gaya tha
 The film has also received several international awards
 paresh mokashi kii ek or film ne dhooma machaai
 'elizabeth Ekadashi'
 maine ye film bhi dekhi he
 This film has also received national awards
 2016 main ek or film ai thi 'court'
 i have not been able to see 28-29 year director Chaitanya Tamhane's 'court' yet but the intention is definitely there
 2016 main bharat kii taraf se court ko hi auskar main bheja gaya tha
 'court' has also received 18 international awards
 rashtriya puraskaar to mila hi he
 Now come to 'fandry' and 'sairat'
 ye donon hi filmein maine dekhi hai
 After watching 'sairat', when i sat watching 'fandry', it seemed that 'sairat' has come out of 'fandry' itself
 'fandry' ke tamaam drishy or kirdaar 'sarat' main jawan hote hai
 The Green Revolution leads to wasteland, liberalization leads to a factory in the town, and cement houses begin to grow, but during this time there is a difference from earlier to now
 jo dalit kirdaar he uske kapade to badal gaye hai, wo padhai main acha or aatmavishvaas se bharaa to nazar aata he magar arthvyavastha kii chot se ghayal nazar aata he
 The pigyard of 'fandry' ends but in 'sairat' we see the other face of the Dalit colony, which we call the slum
 duusari taraf 'fandry' main kuch adhik sansadhano se shuru karne vaala patil parivaar 'sarat' main aate aate saadhan sampann ho jaataa he
 The field is visible from the barn to the convoy of vehicles
 'sarat' ke kai kirdaar 'fandry' main 1990 ke bharat ke pehle ke kirdaar lagate hai
 The characters of 'sairat' are from post-1990 India
 'fandry' kii do chotii vaali nayika 'sarat' main bullate chalaane lagati he
 The hero of 'fandry' pig is also running in 'sairat'
 andaaz se pataa chalata he mahatvakankshaayen dastak dene lagi hai
 In the government tongue, the hero of 'sairat' comes from the Pardhi caste which is a scheduled tribe
 'fandry' or 'sarat' main sookhe ped se lekar chidiyon ke alaava tamaam seen or kirdaaron kii nirantarata dikhti he
 It seems that one is Part One and the other is Part Two
 nagaraj ke tamaam seen 'fandry' se lekar 'sarat' tak main chalate hai
 There is also a scene of a well in 'fandry' where Abodh Jabya is drowning in that dreadful dream that how will that girl be able to get close to Jabya who lives in the pigeon when she becomes impolite after being touched by a pig
 balak sochataa he ki phir wo ladki agar jaan gai ki uske pita boar pakadaney kaa hi kaam karte hai to phir us pyaar kaa kya hoga
 But by coming to 'sairat', this well becomes young
 sookhe main aapane tivi main maharashtra ke ghayal pade kuon ko dekha hoga
 In 'sairat', the architecture of the wells, its depth and the colors of youth blooming in clear water would hardly have been seen in any film
 'sarat' kaa kuan 'fandry' ke boarbaade ke ladke ko kudane ke liye aamantrit karata he
 In the same well, where Archie of 'sairat' rides on a horse and comes to take bath with his friends
 'sarat' tak aate aate itnaa to badla he ki patil kii beti dalit ke ghar jaakar pani piti he or usee kuen main donon baari baari se naha aate hai
 Many people are questioning the film, and after watching the film, many people find themselves standing in front of that face of society, which has not changed from their writing
 main aapke saamne un vishleshanon ke chand hisson ko pesh karnaa chahta hum
 Choosing a piece from an entire article is not unattainable, but TV is a compulsion
 ye khatara isliye uthaa rahaa hum taaki aap dekh saken ki kuch logon ne film dekhne ke baad ise likhte vakt kaise dekha he
 The first commentary is by senior litterateur Vishnu Khare
 kya darshakon ne sirf us suparichit, lagbhag tapori pehle ghante ko chaha? kya unhen bich kaa "dilavaale dulhaniyaan le jaaenge"- sparsh acha laga? kya unhen kasbaai mafia dwaara nayak-nayika ko chez karne or us palaayan main parajeet hone main anand aayaa? kya vah andhra pradesh main apane adarshavaadi 'pavitra' nayak-nayika ke safal sangharsh se khush hue? kya vah jaananaa chaahate the ki baad kii sukh-swapan jaisi zindagi na chale? phir yah darshak he koun? inke paise kaise vasuul hue? kitne dalit, kitne savarna, kin jatiyon ke? kitne kishor / yuva, kitne vayask buddhijivi? kya sab savarnavaad ke aaajeevan shatru rahenge? kya vaaki 'sarat' koi jaateey saamaajik or raajnneetik prashn uthaati he? yah vah traasadee ko hi unka ekmaatr hal banaakar pesh kar rahi he to usamen kahaan manoranjan ho rahaa he ki film super hit he? Kailash Wankhede presented his review after Vishnu Khare's article on Samalochan

in
 'sarat' ek nayika pradhan commercial film he
 Not a documentary
 isliye isamen jhingaat sangeet or gane hai
 But this is not a common film
 aap ise kis jagah se khadey hokar dekh rahe hai kya dekh rahe hai, ek adana sa drishy do shabd, bartaav, chehre ke bhav tay kar dete hai puri film ke uddeshy ko, ab dalit ko gaali dena utana saral nahin rahaa to ve apni ghrinaa kii abhivyakti isi tarah se badale hue shabd, bartaav or haav bhav se pratadit karte hai, pratadit hone waalon kii nigaah se 'sarat' main bahut kuch tuutata banataa he, yah samaj paanaa mushkil he kyonki jahaan sarvajna se bharaa hua gyaan he vahaan abhi tak jis tarah se jati ai he filmon main us tarah se isamen jati saamne nahin aati he
 In this, she does not come with a loud, abusive speech, speech, she is reflected in her face, her behavior
 samalochan dot bloguspot dot in par hi mayank saxena in bahason ko aage badhaate hue likhte hai ki film bananaa bharat main sirf vidha to nahin he, yah ek arthshaastra he, jahaan acchhee se acchhee film ke liye aapako paise jutanaa mushkil hota he, hit flop kaa ganit sabakuch bekaar kar detaa he or jaise hi aap elaan kar dete hai ki film gambhir he vimarsh kii he, jati pratha par he to andhera odh kar so jane ke abhyast log cinema haul tak hi nahin aate
 Nagraj Manjule was not supposed to make the film for the award this time
 aapaki ankhon main jabaran drop se sach daalane kii thi
 Sudipti Satyanand has also written a review of 'sairat' on jankipul
com
 shaayad koi badi film sampurna na hote hue bhi isliye badi ho jaati he ki use dekhne ke baad log film ke bare main kam, samaaj or apane bare main zyada sochane lagate hai
 What did i mean by these questions, why did i not see Sairat, Marathi does not come, i do not have any special interest in Indian language films, then why did i become so eager, what was there to hear from people, a notice to force me to watch There was enough, Nagraj Manjule got many offers from Hindi cinema, but he chose to continue making films in his mother tongue
 main aise vyakti kaa cinema dekhne ke liye sahaj utsuk thi, jisaki jid he ki meraa kaam dekhne ke liye tum meri maatrubhaasha main aao or jab 'sarat' mujh par itani chaa hi gai to likhti hum ki kya dekha
 The comments jayant pavaar ne marathi main isaki samiksha likhi he, jiskaa hindi anuwaad kiya he bharat bhushan tiwari ne
 Jayant is not overwhelmed by this film but does not dismiss, the questions he has raised are probably from the film as well as the society in which we and you live
 jayant likhte hai ki 'shoshak sabhi jatiyon main hai
 Every caste despises the caste below them and becomes haughty when it comes to marriage
 honor kiling har jati main hoti he or aise anek udhaaharan maharashtra main ghate hai
 Therefore, Bahujan artists will have to bravely face these inner creations of exploitation while facing reality from here onwards
 'sarat' ne yah chunauti sweekaar nahin kii magar aage kii raah zarur spasht kii he
 Someone else does injustice to us in this reality but it is not easy to show that we ourselves do injustice to our men
 koi jati ko lekar baat kar rahaa he
 Some heroes are talking about the heroine, some are talking about the face of economic development, some are talking about something
 hamane sochaa ki ek pareshaan kar dene vaali kaamyaab film banane vaala bhi kya utana hi pareshaan he
 So, let me introduce you to this director of Marathi cinema
 jiskaa naam he nagaraj popatrav manjule

 main aapke saamne un vishleshanon ke chand hisson ko pesh karnaa chahta hum
 Choosing a piece from an entire article is not unattainable, but TV is a compulsion
 ye khatara isliye uthaa rahaa hum taaki aap dekh saken ki kuch logon ne film dekhne ke baad ise likhte vakt kaise dekha he
 The first commentary is by senior litterateur Vishnu Khare
 kya darshakon ne sirf us suparichit, lagbhag tapori pehle ghante ko chaha? kya unhen bich kaa "dilavaale dulhaniyaan le jaaenge"- sparsh acha laga? kya unhen kasbaai mafia dwaara nayak-nayika ko chez karne or us palaayan main parajeet hone main anand aayaa? kya vah andhra pradesh main apane adarshavaadi 'pavitra' nayak-nayika ke safal sangharsh se khush hue? kya vah jaananaa chaahate the ki baad kii sukh-swapan jaisi zindagi na chale? phir yah darshak he koun? inke paise kaise vasuul hue? kitne dalit, kitne savarna, kin jatiyon ke? kitne kishor / yuva, kitne vayask buddhijivi? kya sab savarnavaad ke aaajeevan shatru rahenge? kya vaaki 'sarat' koi jaateey saamaajik or raajnneetik prashn uthaati he? yah vah traasadee ko hi unka ekmaatr hal banaakar pesh kar rahi he to usamen kahaan manoranjan ho rahaa he ki film super hit he? Kailash Wankhede presented his review after Vishnu Khare's article on Samalochan

 'sarat' ek nayika pradhan commercial film he
 Not a documentary
 isliye isamen jhingaat sangeet or gane hai
 But this is not a common film
 aap ise kis jagah se khadey hokar dekh rahe hai kya dekh rahe hai, ek adana sa drishy do shabd, bartaav, chehre ke bhav tay kar dete hai puri film ke uddeshy ko, ab dalit ko gaali dena utana saral nahin rahaa to ve apni ghrinaa kii abhivyakti isi tarah se badale hue shabd, bartaav or haav bhav se pratadit karte hai, pratadit hone waalon kii nigaah se 'sarat' main bahut kuch tuutata banataa he, yah samaj paanaa mushkil he kyonki jahaan sarvajna se bharaa hua gyaan he vahaan abhi tak jis tarah se jati ai he filmon main us tarah se isamen jati saamne nahin aati he
 In this, she does not come with a loud, abusive speech, speech, she is reflected in her face, her behavior
 samalochan dot bloguspot dot in par hi mayank saxena in bahason ko aage badhaate hue likhte hai ki film bananaa bharat main sirf vidha to nahin he, yah ek arthshaastra he, jahaan acchhee se acchhee film ke liye aapako paise jutanaa mushkil hota he, hit flop kaa ganit sabakuch bekaar kar detaa he or jaise hi aap elaan kar dete hai ki film gambhir he vimarsh kii he, jati pratha par he to andhera odh kar so jane ke abhyast log cinema haul tak hi nahin aate
 Nagraj Manjule was not supposed to make the film for the award this time
 aapaki ankhon main jabaran drop se sach daalane kii thi
 Sudipti Satyanand has also written a review of 'sairat' on jankipul
com
 shaayad koi badi film sampurna na hote hue bhi isliye badi ho jaati he ki use dekhne ke baad log film ke bare main kam, samaaj or apane bare main zyada sochane lagate hai
 What did i mean by these questions, why did i not see Sairat, Marathi does not come, i do not have any special interest in Indian language films, then why did i become so eager, what was there to hear from people, a notice to force me to watch There was enough, Nagraj Manjule got many offers from Hindi cinema, but he chose to continue making films in his mother tongue
 main aise vyakti kaa cinema dekhne ke liye sahaj utsuk thi, jisaki jid he ki meraa kaam dekhne ke liye tum meri maatrubhaasha main aao or jab 'sarat' mujh par itani chaa hi gai to likhti hum ki kya dekha
 The comments jayant pavaar ne marathi main isaki samiksha likhi he, jiskaa hindi anuwaad kiya he bharat bhushan tiwari ne
 Jayant is not overwhelmed by this film but does not dismiss, the questions he has raised are probably from the film as well as the society in which we and you live
 jayant likhte hai ki 'shoshak sabhi jatiyon main hai
 Every caste despises the caste below them and becomes haughty when it comes to marriage
 honor kiling har jati main hoti he or aise anek udhaaharan maharashtra main ghate hai
 Therefore, Bahujan artists will have to bravely face these inner creations of exploitation while facing reality from here onwards
 'sarat' ne yah chunauti sweekaar nahin kii magar aage kii raah zarur spasht kii he
 Someone else does injustice to us in this reality but it is not easy to show that we ourselves do injustice to our men
 koi jati ko lekar baat kar rahaa he
 Some heroes are talking about the heroine, some are talking about the face of economic development, some are talking about something
 hamane sochaa ki ek pareshaan kar dene vaali kaamyaab film banane vaala bhi kya utana hi pareshaan he
 So, let me introduce you to this director of Marathi cinema
 jiskaa naam he nagaraj popatrav manjule
 So i said that i am going to talk on 'sairat' when it has been several weeks since the film was released
 film maine dekhi he
 'harishchandrachi Factory', 'elizabeth Ekadashi', 'court', 'fandry' and now 'sairat'
 kya marathi cinema apane kisi nae daur se guzar rahaa he
 Where there is no talk of funds and distribution
 kahani or kirdaar kii hone lagi he
 In the words of Vishnu Khare, a new total school of Marathi cinema has been developed
 2009 main 'harishchandrachi factory' ai thi
 Paresh Mokashi's film was discussed a lot
 is film ko marathi main shreshth feechar film kaa rashtriya puraskaar mil chukaa he
 In 2009, it was sent from India in the category of Best Foreign Language Film
 is film ko bhi kai antarrashtriya puraskaar mili hai
 Another film by Paresh Mokashi made a splash
 'elizabeth ekadshi'
 i have also seen this film
 is film ko bhi rashtriya puraskaar mil chuke hai
 In 2016, another film came 'court'
 28-29 saal ke nirdeshak chaitanya tamhane kii 'court' abhi tak nahin dekh sakaa hum par iraadaa zarur he
 In 2016, the court was sent to the Oscars on behalf of India
 'court' ko bhi 18 antarrashtriya puraskaar mil chuke hai
 Has received the National Award
 ab aate hai 'fandry' or 'sarat' par
 i have seen both these films
 'sarat' dekhne ke baad jab 'fandry' dekhne baitha to laga ki 'sarat', 'fandry' se hi nikali he
 All the scenes and characters of 'fandry' are young in 'sairat'
 harith kranti se banzar zamin lahalhane lagati he, udaarikaran ke chalate kasbe main kaarkaana lagata he or cement ke makaan bade hone lagate hai, magar is dauraan ek antar pehle se lekar ab tak bana nazar aata he
 The clothes of the Dalit character have changed, he looks good in studies and full of self-confidence but seems injured by the injury of the economy
 'fandry' kaa suarbada khatm ho jaataa he magar 'sarat' main dalit basti kaa doosraa cheharaa nazar aata he jise ham jhuggi kehete hai
 On the other hand, the Patil family, who started with some more resources in 'fandry', becomes resourceful by coming to 'sairat'
 khet khalihaan se lekar gadiyon kaa kafila tak nazar aata he
 Many of 'sairat' characters appear in 'fandry', an early 1990s Indian character
 'sarat' ke kirdaar 1990 ke bharat ke baad ke hai
 The two-headed heroine of 'fandry' starts firing bullets in 'sairat'
 'fandry' ke suarbare kaa nayak 'sarat' main bhi daud laga rahaa he
 The style shows that ambitions are knocking
 sarkari jubaan main 'sarat' kaa nayak pardhi jati se aata he jo ek anusuchit janajati he
 'fandry' and 'sairat' show the continuity of all the scenes and characters, apart from dried trees to sparrows
 aisa lagata he ki ek part van he or doosraa part tu
 All the scenes of Nagraj run from 'fandry' to 'sairat'
 'fandry' main bhi kuen kaa drishy he jahaan abodh jabya us kufnaak sapane main dub rahaa he ki jab wo ladki boar se chhu jane par apavitra ho jaati he to boarbaade main rahane vaale jabya ke kareeb kaise aa paaegi
 The child thinks that if that girl then knows that her father only works to catch pigs, then what will happen to that love
 lekin 'sarat' tak aate aate ye kuan jawan ho jaataa he
 You may have seen the injured wells of Maharashtra on TV in the drought
 'sarat' main kuon kii vaastukala, uski gaharaai or saaf pani main khilti javaani ke aise rang shaayad hi kisi film main nazar aae honge
 The well of 'sairat' invites the pigeon boy from 'fandry' to jump
 usee kuen main jahaan 'sarat' kii archi ghode par savaar hokar apni sakhiyon ke saath nahaane aati he
 By coming to 'sairat', it has changed so much that Patil's daughter goes to the house of Dalit and drinks water and both take a shower in the same well
 kai log film par sawaal kar rahe hai to kai log film dekhne ke baad samaaj ke us chehre ke saamne khud ko khadaa pate hai jo unke likhane bolne se badla hi nahin
 i would like to present to you a few parts of those analyzes
 ek puure lekh se ek tukdaa chunanaa khatare se khaali nahin magar tivi kii majaburi he
 i am taking this risk so that you can see how some people have seen it while writing the film
 pehali tippanee varisht sahityakar vishnu khare kii he
 Did the audience just want that well-known, almost drunken first hour? Will they take the middle "dilwale Dulhanis" - nice touch? Did he enjoy chasing the hero-heroine by the town mafia and being defeated in that escape? Did he rejoice with the successful struggle of his idealistic 'pious' hero-heroine in Andhra Pradesh? Did he want to know that a life like the latter would not go on? Then who is this audience? How was their money recovered? How many Dalits, how many upper castes, which castes? How many teens / young, how many adult intellectuals? Will everyone remain lifelong enemies of Savarnism? Does 'sairat' really raise any ethnic social and political questions? This is presenting the tragedy as their only solution, so where is the entertainment that the film is a super hit? samalochan dot bloguspot dot in par vishnu khare ke lekh ke baad kailash vankhede ne apni samiksha pesh kii
 'sairat' is a heroine head commercial film
 documentry nahin he
 Hence it has jingat music and songs
 lekin yah aam film nahin he
 From where you are standing, what are you looking at, what are you looking at, a couple of scenes, two words, behavior, facial expressions decide the purpose of the whole film, now it is not so easy to abuse the Dalit, then they are disgusted In the same way the expression of the word torture with changed words, behavior and grief, a lot of 'sairat' is broken in the eyes of the abusers, it is difficult to understand because where the omniscient is Loaded knowledge there is still the way to race the way i do films which race does not come out
 isamen to vah bina badbolepan se, gaali se, bhaashan se nahin ai, vah chehre par, uske vyavhaar main parilakshith hoti he
 Mayank Saxena furthering these debates writes on the blog critic
com blogspot that making a film is not just a genre in India, it is an economics where it is difficult to raise money for the best film, hit flop Mathematics makes everything useless and as soon as you declare that the film is serious, it is discussed, on the caste system, then people wont to sleep blindly in the cinema Not come up
 nagaraj manjule ko is baar puraskaar ke liye film nahin banani thi
 Your eyes had to put the truth with a forced drop
 janakipul dot com par sudipti satyanand ne bhi 'sarat' kii samiksha likhi he
 Probably, even if a big film is not complete, it becomes big because after watching it, people start thinking less about the film, society and more about themselves
 mujhe in sawaalon se kya matlab, maine kyon dekhi sarat, marathi aati nahin, bhartiya bhashaaon kii film kaa koi khaas shauk nahin, phir kyon itani utsuk ho gayi thi, logon se tarif sunakar kya, mujhe dekhne ke liye majaboor karne ke liye ek soochna bhar kaaphi thi, nagaraj manjule ko hindi cinema ke kai ofer mili par unhone apni maatrubhaasha main film banaate rahanaa chunaa
 i was naturally eager to see the cinema of such a person, who insisted that you come to my mother tongue to see my work and when 'sairat' was so much on me, i write what i saw
 tippaniyan Jayant Pawar has written a review in Marathi, which has been translated into Hindi by Bharat Bhushan Tiwari
 jayant is film se abhibhoot nahin he lekin khaarij bhi nahin karte hai, jo sawaal unhone uthaaye hai shaayad wo film ke saath saath is samaaj se bhi hai jisamen ham or aap rahete hai
 Jayant writes that 'the exploiters are of all castes
 har jati apane se neeche vaali jati ko tuchh samajhati he or vivaah sambandh kii baat hone par haivaan ban jaati he
 Honor killing occurs in every caste and many such examples have occurred in Maharashtra
 isliye bahujan kalakaaron ko yahaan se aage yatharth se bhidate hue shoshan kii in bhitari salawaton kaa bahaduree se saamana karnaa hoga
 'sairat' did not accept this challenge, but it has definitely clarified the way forward
 koi doosraa hamaare saath anyaay karata he is yatharth main subhita he magar ham khud apane aadamiyon ke saath anyaay karte hai yah dikhaanaa aasaan nahin hota
 Someone is talking about caste
 koi nayak nayika ko lekar, koi aarthik vikaas ke chehre ko lekar baat kar rahaa he to koi kuch

 shaayad koi badi film sampurna na hote hue bhi isliye badi ho jaati he ki use dekhne ke baad log film ke bare main kam, samaaj or apane bare main zyada sochane lagate hai
 What do i mean by these questions, why did i not see Sairat, Marathi does not come , i do not have a particular passion for Indian language films, then why did i become so eager, what was it to hear from people, to force me to watch There was a lot of information, Nagraj Manjule got many offers from Hindi cinema, but he chose to continue making films in his mother tongue
 main aise vyakti kaa cinema dekhne ke liye sahaj utsuk thi, jisaki jid he ki meraa kaam dekhne ke liye tum meri maatrubhaasha main aao or jab 'sarat' mujh par itani chaa hi gai to likhti hum ki kya dekha
 The comments jayant pavaar ne marathi main isaki samiksha likhi he, jiskaa hindi anuwaad kiya he bharat bhushan tiwari ne
 Jayant is not overwhelmed by this film but does not dismiss, the questions he has raised are probably from the film as well as the society in which we and you live
 jayant likhte hai ki 'shoshak sabhi jatiyon main hai
 Every caste despises the caste below them and becomes haughty when it comes to marriage
 honor kiling har jati main hoti he or aise anek udhaaharan maharashtra main ghate hai
 Therefore, Bahujan artists will have to bravely face these inner creations of exploitation while facing reality from here onwards
 'sarat' ne yah chunauti sweekaar nahin kii magar aage kii raah zarur spasht kii he
 Someone else does injustice to us in this reality but it is not easy to show that we ourselves do injustice to our men
 koi jati ko lekar baat kar rahaa he
 Some heroes are talking about the heroine, some are talking about the face of economic development, some are talking about something
 hamane sochaa ki ek pareshaan kar dene vaali kaamyaab film banane vaala bhi kya utana hi pareshaan he
 So, let me introduce you to this director of Marathi cinema

 Did the audience just want that well-known, almost drunken first hour? Will they take the middle "dilwale Dulhanis" - nice touch? Did he enjoy chasing the hero-heroine by the town mafia and being defeated in that escape? Did he rejoice with the successful struggle of his idealistic 'pious' hero-heroine in Andhra Pradesh? Did he want to know that a life like the latter would not go on? Then who is this audience? How was their money recovered? How many Dalits, how many upper castes, which castes? How many teens / young, how many adult intellectuals? Will everyone remain lifelong enemies of Savarnism? Does 'sairat' really raise any ethnic social and political questions? This is presenting the tragedy as their only solution, so where is the entertainment that the film is a super hit? samalochan dot bloguspot dot in par vishnu khare ke lekh ke baad kailash vankhede ne apni samiksha pesh kii
 'sairat' is a heroine head commercial film
 documentry nahin he
 Hence it has jingat music and songs
 lekin yah aam film nahin he
 From where you are standing, what are you looking at, what are you looking at, a couple of scenes, two words, behavior, facial expressions decide the purpose of the whole film, now it is not so easy to abuse the Dalit, then they are disgusted In the same way the expression of the word torture with changed words, behavior and grief, a lot of 'sairat' is broken in the eyes of the abusers, it is difficult to understand because where the omniscient is Loaded knowledge there is still the way to race the way i do films which race does not come out
 isamen to vah bina badbolepan se, gaali se, bhaashan se nahin ai, vah chehre par, uske vyavhaar main parilakshith hoti he
 Mayank Saxena furthering these debates writes on the blog critic
com blogspot that making a film is not just a genre in India, it is an economics where it is difficult to raise money for the best film, hit flop Mathematics makes everything useless and as soon as you declare that the film is serious, it is discussed, on the caste system, then people wont to sleep blindly in the cinema Not come up
 nagaraj manjule ko is baar puraskaar ke liye film nahin banani thi

 janakipul dot com par sudipti satyanand ne bhi 'sarat' kii samiksha likhi he
 Probably, even if a big film is not complete, it becomes big because after watching it, people start thinking less about the film, society and more about themselves
 mujhe in sawaalon se kya matlab, maine kyon dekhi sarat, marathi aati nahin, bhartiya bhashaaon kii film kaa koi khaas shauk nahin, phir kyon itani utsuk ho gayi thi, logon se tarif sunakar kya, mujhe dekhne ke liye majaboor karne ke liye ek soochna bhar kaaphi thi, nagaraj manjule ko hindi cinema ke kai ofer mili par unhone apni maatrubhaasha main film banaate rahanaa chunaa

 What did i mean by these questions, why did i not see Sairat, Marathi does not come, i do not have any special interest in Indian language films, then why did i become so eager, what was there to hear from people, a notice to force me to watch There was enough, Nagraj Manjule got many offers from Hindi cinema, but he chose to continue making films in his mother tongue
 main aise vyakti kaa cinema dekhne ke liye sahaj utsuk thi, jisaki jid he ki meraa kaam dekhne ke liye tum meri maatrubhaasha main aao or jab 'sarat' mujh par itani chaa hi gai to likhti hum ki kya dekha
 The comments jayant pavaar ne marathi main isaki samiksha likhi he, jiskaa hindi anuwaad kiya he bharat bhushan tiwari ne
 Jayant is not overwhelmed by this film but does not dismiss, the questions he has raised are probably from the film as well as the society in which we and you live
 jayant likhte hai ki 'shoshak sabhi jatiyon main hai
 Every caste despises the caste below them and becomes haughty when it comes to marriage
 honor kiling har jati main hoti he or aise anek udhaaharan maharashtra main ghate hai
 Therefore, Bahujan artists will have to bravely face these inner creations of exploitation while facing reality from here onwards
 'sarat' ne yah chunauti sweekaar nahin kii magar aage kii raah zarur spasht kii he
 Someone else does injustice to us in this reality but it is not easy to show that we ourselves do injustice to our men
 koi jati ko lekar baat kar rahaa he
 Some heroes are talking about the heroine, some are talking about the face of economic development, some are talking about something
 hamane sochaa ki ek pareshaan kar dene vaali kaamyaab film banane vaala bhi kya utana hi pareshaan he
 So, let me introduce you to this director of Marathi cinema
 jiskaa naam he nagaraj popatrav manjule
 Jayant Pawar has written a review in Marathi, which has been translated into Hindi by Bharat Bhushan Tiwari
 jayant is film se abhibhoot nahin he lekin khaarij bhi nahin karte hai, jo sawaal unhone uthaaye hai shaayad wo film ke saath saath is samaaj se bhi hai jisamen ham or aap rahete hai
 Jayant writes that 'the exploiters are of all castes
 har jati apane se neeche vaali jati ko tuchh samajhati he or vivaah sambandh kii baat hone par haivaan ban jaati he
 Honor killing occurs in every caste and many such examples have occurred in Maharashtra
 isliye bahujan kalakaaron ko yahaan se aage yatharth se bhidate hue shoshan kii in bhitari salawaton kaa bahaduree se saamana karnaa hoga
 'sairat' did not accept this challenge, but it has definitely clarified the way forward
 koi doosraa hamaare saath anyaay karata he is yatharth main subhita he magar ham khud apane aadamiyon ke saath anyaay karte hai yah dikhaanaa aasaan nahin hota
 Someone is talking about caste
 koi nayak nayika ko lekar, koi aarthik vikaas ke chehre ko lekar baat kar rahaa he to koi kuch
 We wondered whether the producer of a disturbingly successful film was equally upset
 isliye main aapako marathi cinema ke is nirdeshak se mulaakaat karwaata hum
 Which is named Nagaraja Popatrao Manjule
 koi jati ko lekar baat kar rahaa he
 Some heroes are talking about the heroine, some are talking about the face of economic development, some are talking about something
 hamane sochaa ki ek pareshaan kar dene vaali kaamyaab film banane vaala bhi kya utana hi pareshaan he
 So, let me introduce you to this director of Marathi cinema
