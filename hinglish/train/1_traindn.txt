 ) bhartiya coast guard diaiji bike loshalikesandigdh pakistani boat ke blastmaamle main buudhvaar ko die gaye bayaan par vivaad badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Pakistan's Defense Minister Khwaja Asif has said that the claim of a Coast Guard official that the Pakistani boat was flown by force is contradictory to the statement of the Indian government
 bharat se ai khabaron par pratikriya jaahir karte hue unhone kaha, 'yah ek baar phir se sabit ho gaya he ki bharat ne antarrashtriya niyamon kaa ulanghan kiya or maanavtaa ko taar taar kar diya
 Asif alleged, "it (india) is not only baseless and falsely accusing Pakistan like the Samjhauta Express case but it is also involved in deceitfully killing four innocent innocent people on board
" bharat ne ek baar phir apana ghinauna rup dikhaa diya he
 He reiterated that Pakistan wants peace and co-existence in the region and it should not be seen as its weakness

 a video of Coast Guard DIG Loshali's statement has surfaced, in which he says that he had given orders to blow up a Pakistani boat entering India's maritime border
 parrikar ne kaha ki sarkaar apane bayaan par adig he
 He said the boat itself was detonated by suspected terrorists and the government was ready to release evidence
 loshaali ne somvaar ko bayaan diya tha, 'main aapako bataa duun
 i hope you all remember the night of December 31
 hamane pakistani boat ko uda diya tha
 i was present there in Gandhinagar and i asked at night to blow up the boat
 ham unhen biryani nahin khilaanaa chaahate
 Loseli's statement came to the media, only after a few minutes questions were asked to the Defense Minister about it
 angreji news paper 'indian express' ne buudhvaar ko loshaali ke daawey ke sambandh main ek khabar chalaai
 Later in the day, Parrikar responded to the case, and the news paper released a video on its website
 loshaali ne apane bayaan se mukarte hue pratikriya dene se manaa kar diya
 He is also the head of the Northwest Region of the Coast Guard

 When asked about this, the Defense Minister said, 'you have to understand my position
 kareeb 15-16 lakh rakshakarmi hai
 If someone makes a factually incorrect statement, i will take action after the investigation
 ' raksha mantri ne kaha, 'main ghatana ke saboot jari karuunga
 In January, Parrikar had said that the Pakistani boat sank after an explosion in the sea off the coast of Gujarat, the people in it were smugglers and not terrorists
 unhone is baat kii bhi pushti kii thi ki ek anya boat kaa bhi pataa laga tha, lekin vah antarrashtriya samudri kshetra main tha
 After such reports appeared in the media, Loshali said, 'that campaign did not happen under me

 isi vajah se yahaan kii siyasat bhi kushti ke khel kii tarah hi viksit hui he
 When this state was formed in 1966 and my father was transferred here as punishment, as usual, a text of the state was printed on the back of our sixth textbooks
 mujhe shabdashah to yaad nahin lekin vah kuch aise tha, ‘‘mahaara des haryana, jahaan doodh-dahi kaa khaanaa
 Soon the politics of politics, horse trading and kidnapping of mlas started in the state politics and a champion emerged in this game
 unka naam tha gaya laal
 i do not know how his parents, keeping this name, knew that he would become immortal as India's most infamous defender and the saying would go by his name, "aya Ram, Gaya Ram"
 yahaan ke logon ne aisi siyasat par rajya ke geet ko apane hisaab se badal daalaa jo baad main kuch yun bana, ‘‘mahaara des haryana, jahaan doodh-dahi kaa khaanaa, aataa mili naa dana, mahaara kaam aana janaa
 "to analyze how Haryana has become a stronghold of this kind of rough and unstable politics, it requires a person like Yogendra Yadav
 sambhawatah aisa isliye hua hoga ki punjab se ulat isane rajya ke adhikaar ke liye koi ladaai nahin ladi
 That is why even the popular leaders of state level appeal did not happen here
 yahaan kai jatiyaan or sthaneey netaa rahe
 That is why ideological and political loyalty did not have any special meaning, whereas no caste dominated in terms of numbers, but Jat became the most powerful fraternity, staying just above 20 per cent
 jaaton ke bheetar bhi haalanki kai pratidwandvi netaa the jinhone apane-apane kunbe bana liye
 The best example of Kunbapastha politics was seen as Tau Devi Lal, who was asked by a reporter at a press conference about his son (chautala) to pursue, "so whose son am I?" To take you forward, your opponent? ”while the rival Jat clan fought for politics and power, other communities had established themselves as nobles and became rich
 masalan, vinod sharma or unke pita ke
 N
 sharma ke rup main ek nae brahman parivaar kaa udai hua jo sharaab, real estate or hotel kaarobaar kaa badshaah banakar ubhara
 Similarly, an unusual type of local leader emerged in Sirsa, who was born in the house of an RSS worker but who later shone his fortune in the real estate business of Gurgaon
 modi kii yah tippanee ki haryana koun banegaa karodpati ke khel main fansaa hua he, uskaa yah shaks jeeta-jaagta udhaaharan he
 Its name is Gopal Goyal Kanda, who takes pride in calling himself "baniya ka Chhokra" and who repeatedly refers to a shop named "glorious Shoes" as his debut
 nirdaleey vidhayak ke taur par chune jane ke baad isane hooda kii sarkaar ko 2010 main girane se bachaaya or mantri bana
 After that, the history of the suicide story of his air hostess is well known
 aaj vah jamaanat par he or shahar ke nirdhantam ilaakon main baari bheed juta rahaa he
 He has looted his money on thousands of people, but if you call him Robinhood then his supporters will get angry
 aakhirkaar, usne bhi to haryana kii raajnneeti ke tamaam duusare chehron kii tarah jameen bech or kharidkar hi paisa banaaya he, koi opium kii taskari thode kii he! apni sabhaaon main jutane vaali bheed ko kanda is tarah uphaar baantate hai ki jayalalita bhi sharmaa jaaen
 Women come to him with their children for their blessings
 haryana main aapraadhik aarope kaa hona vafaadaaron ke bich koi mudda nahin he, chaahe ve chautaala hon yaa kanda
 Walking with me in the midst of campaigning, Kanda tells me about his past, how his father passed away at the age of 13 and that no one came from the RSS / Jana Sangh to ask him, despite his father being twice from Sirsa in the Lok Sabha
 Had been a candidate for kanda kaa ghar 12 acre main failaa ek kila he jisaki deevaaren madhyakaalin laal baluupathar se bani hai or unke upar oonche parcote bane hai
 For his Guru Tara Baba, he has built a temple complex on more than a hundred acres of land in which the statue of Shiva installed is even bigger than the statue near Delhi Airport
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘apni jindagi ke bare main main aapako kya bataaun, sivaay iske ki vah ek pariktha jaisi he
 "they are confident that they will win and they will not have to go back to jail
" chautaala ko aisa koi bhram nahin he kyonki ve jaanate hai ki jald hi tihaad main unki vaapasi hone vaali he
 In the case of appointment of school teachers, a harsh judge had convicted him that he had recruited 3,000 teachers corruptly during his chief ministership
 unhen isse fark nahin padataa
 His supporters ask if not everyone gives jobs to his people
 haryana bharat kaa sabase bhrasht rajya bhale na ho, lekin isamen do raay nahin ki siyaasi bhrashtachar ke prati uski sahishnutaa kii had tamilnadu ko pani pilaati he
 Not only this, but also the Behayi whose Chautala himself is represented
 ve kehete hai ki ve jail laut jaaenge lekin usase koi fark nahin padegaa
 He will be sworn in as the Chief Minister from within Tihar Jail and will be one step ahead of Amma who is running her government from jail
 chautaala kehete hai ki tyaag unki ragon main bharaa hua he
 His father Devi Lal had given up like Lord Ram when he left the throne in 1989 for younger brother Vishwanath Pratap Singh
 ve poochhate hai ki jail se bhala unhen dar kyon lagane laga? aakhir ve apane mamaa ke yahaan paidaa hue the jab devilal angrejon kii jail main the, bilkul bhagwaan krishna kii tarah jo mamaa kansa kii jail main janme the
 That is why his family is also divine and it is a matter of pride to go to jail
 ise behayaayi kahana behayaayi kaa apmaan hoga
 Better let us borrow the word for it from Vishal Bhardwaj's film Haider - it is much closer to daring! On a personal level, Chautala is not as rude
 kai baar meri unase khulkar baatcheet hui he
 During one such vegetarian meal, he told me why a person is hungry for power
 unhone kaha tha, ‘‘aapke paas jab satta hoti he to aap na sirf apane virodhiyon ko balki uske logon ko, uske sabase nichle chamachon ko bhi pratadit karte hai
 "then they go to their masters and plead there to save them, but they are not relieved from there either
" unhone kaha tha, ‘‘phir kitna majaa aata he unako tadapate dekhne main
 He said that this is the reason why it is better for him to wait for years in this business, even there is no problem in going to jail to get power, so that it can be enjoyed later
 ve puure yakeen ke saath maanate hai ki bhupendra hooda ne apana daur puraa kar liya or rajya kii ulatpher vaali siyasat main ab unki baari he
 This fact could have been fine because they are the basic contenders of Jat votes and their party is also capable and fit
 lekin ek jat ke badale duusare jat ke kunbe vaali haryana kii paramparaagat siyasat main is baar ek bahari ne send laga di he
 He is Narendra Modi
 haryana ke apane chunaav prachaar main modi ne kaha tha ki yahaan ke log haai-fi yaa vaai-fi chaahate hai lekin unka jor sirf safai par he
 You must have been surprised to hear this, but were they just playing with words? Once you look around in Haryana
 yahaan ke dhabas tak nickshulk vaai-fi kii suvidha dete hai or ‘‘deje academies’’ aadi haai-fi kaa ehsaas karaate hai
 Do you still need to be reminded that our Haryana is the richest province of the country? Now in the case of sports, keep aside our rustic choice, rough politics, desi ghee, milk and buffaloes and read the writings on the walls again
 aap tay paaenge ki modi inhen padhgaye main chook nahin kar rahe hai

 Offenses such as kidnapping, rape against minors are not being named
 lekin rajdhani dilli ke mongolpuri main logon kii sajagata ne dedh saal kii ek maasoom bacchee ko jarur bachaa liya
 Actually, a young man was trying to kidnap the girl with the intention of rape, but the alert neighbors thwarted her intention
 yah ghatana bahari dilli ke mongolpuri ilaake ke es block main der shanivaar der shaam kii he
 People handed over the accused to the police
 police ne aaropee kii pahchaan uttar pradesh main azamgarh ke rahane vaale yashpal ke rup main kii he
 Police said that the accused works in a gas agency in Delhi
 police ne aaropee ke paas senshe kii 100 goliyambhi baraamad kii hai
 Now the police is questioning him and trying to find out whether he has ever done such an incident before
 saath hi bacchee ko kidanap karne ke peeche uskaa makasad kya tha?puri ghatana kaa sisitivi footage bhi aa gaya he
 It can be seen in the footage that before kidnapping the girl, the accused made several rounds of Neelake's Reiki and the lane

 Then the woman named Meera, who lived in the neighborhood, got angry

 basapa supremeo mayawati ko veshya se badtar bataane vaale upi bijepi upaadhyaksh dayashankar singh ko party ne 6 saal ke liye nishkasit kar diya he
 Earlier, BSP leader Mevalal lodged an FIR against Dayashankar for this statement in Hazratganj Kotwali, Lucknow
 isbayanko lekar guuruuvaar ko bispi netaa or kaaryakarta lakhanu main virodh pradarshan karenge
 BSP leader Nasimuddin Siddiqui said that at the behest of BJP President Amit Shah, Dayashankar Singh insulted Mayawati
 bispi saansad auramayawatike salaahkaar satishchandra mishra ne kaha ki wo is maamle ko court main lekar jaaenge
 The entire opposition in the Rajya Sabha demanded the arrest of the BJP leader who made the statement and brought a condemnation motion
 sansad main guuruuvaar ko bijepi daliton ke mudde par apane netaa ke bayaan ke baad baikfoot par aa gai
 His own leader's indecent statement against Mayawati, which was surrounded by sharp opposition attacks on the issue of beating Dalits in Una, Gujarat, put the BJP in trouble
 mayawati ne sansad main sarkaar ko gherise maamle main rajyasabha main puraa vipaksh mayawati ke saath main sarkaar ke khilaaf ekajute ho gaya
 The opposition demanded the arrest of Dayashankar Singh, who made a statement, under the SC-ST Act
 arun jetali ne bhi sadan main kaha ki wo apane netaa ke is bayaan ke liye vyaktigat pidaa or khed prakat karte he or sadan ko karrwai karne kaa bharosa dete he
 Dayashankar asked for apology, in the pressure of the party high command, Dayashankar Singh had apologized to Mayawati on his statement
 pehle se hi bijepi daliton ke mudde par mayawati samet vipaksh ke nishane par he
 In such a situation, the BJP leader's statement against Mayawati before the UP election definitely upset the party, so the party did not delay in taking action on Dayashankar Singh
 pehle bijepi ne dayashankar singh ko sirf upaadhyaksh ke pad se hataaya, lekin dabaav badhane ke baad party se 6 saal ke liye nishkasit kar diya
 North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un arrived in Beijing on Sunday on a four-day visit to China
 rashtradhyaksh banane ke baad vah pehali baar apane desh se baahar nikle hai
 Chinese officials say he has arrived at the invitation of President Xi Jinping and this is his personal visit
 haalanki, unki achaanak is yatra ko lekar tamaam tarah kii atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai
 Some experts say that there is a pressure on Kim to come to China
 aaie jaanate hai ki kya he puraa maajaraa-jaankaron ke anusaar, kim kii is yatra se saaf lagata he ki vah dabaav main hai
 According to the Fox Business News website, China has pressured Kim to visit Beijing
 website ne prasiddh pustak 'newclear shodown' ke lekhak gordon chang ke hawaale se kaha he ki china ne iske liye kaaphi dabaav banaaya
 Significantly, Kim arrived in China on Sunday by a mysterious train with heavy security arrangements
 vah saal 2011 main satta hasil karne ke baad pehali baar apane desh se baahar nikle hai
 Chang said that the first reason for Kim to reach Beijing is that China asked him to come
 mahangi padi china se rishton main khatallag-thalag pad chuke uttar korea ke liye china hi ek sahaara tha, lekin pichley kuch varshon main donon deshon ke rishton main kaaphi sakhti aa gai thi

 aayaat par roak se tut gaya uttar korea!china ne november maheene main uttar korea ke louh ayask, koyala or shishe ke apane desh main aayaat par bhi roak laga di thi
 This halt proved to be bigger than US sanctions for North Korea
 isaki vajah se kim shashan kii haalat kharaab ho gai
 North Korea's economy has become very limited and from this it also has to raise funds for its nuclear and missile defense programs
 trump se milane se pehle china kii muhar jaruri!chang ke anusaar, kim dakshin korea ke raashtrapati moon jaae se agle maheene milane vaale hai
 After this, he is going to America in May
 aise main china kaa laga ki vah to is ilaake main kootnithik lihaaj se haashie par ja rahaa he, isliye usne kim ko bulaava bhej diya
 Kim's visit ensures that he is willing to seek China's approval and consult with Trump before meeting Trump
 neuyork times se uttar korea maamalon par china kii pramukh export yang shiyu kahati hai ki is daure se saaf he ki kim jong china ke saath apane bighad chuke rishte ko sudhaarna chaahate hai
 The effect of this pressure is that Kim has agreed not to abandon nuclear weapons at all, but to negotiate the possibility of stopping the program

 centre sarkaar ke dwaara sahakaari bainkon main puraane noton kaa len-dein band karne elaan karne ke baad se hi aam logon ko mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 On Thursday afternoon, when Naumilal reached the District Cooperative Bank in Mohanlalganj, Lucknow with four notes of ₹ 500 in hand, he was happy to see only a few people there
 naumilal ne sochaa ki wo jaldi se apane ₹2000 badalawakar kuch gehun, kheton ke liye khaad or ghar ke kuch jaruri chijen kharid lenge
 But after hearing what the employee of the cooperative bank told him, the ground slipped under the feet of Naumilal
 bank karmchaaree ne bataaya ki yahaan naa to uske ₹2000 badale ja sakate hai or naa hi vah ise apane khate main jamaa kar saktaa he
 Instead of changing the note, he was shown the news printed in the newspaper which said that cooperative banks are not allowed to exchange and deposit old notes
 dihadi mazdooree karne vaale naumi laal ko 500 or 1000 rupee ke note band hone ke bare main to pataa tha lekin apane coparative bank par use bharosa tha jahaan uskaa acount uske chachaa ne 20 saal pehle khulwaaya tha
 From then till today Naumilal neither went to any other bank nor did he ever try to open an account in any other bank
 use lagata tha ki us jaise garib logon ke liye coparative bank kii sabase thik jagah he
 At home, flour and rice were all over; Naomi Lal was in dire need of money today
 parivaar main chaar bachche hai, jinhen paalane ke liye vah khud or uski patni donon mazdooree karte hai
 There were many times when he did not get wages, so he took a field on his farm near his village
 yani khet kisi or kaa lekin naumilal vahaan apni patni ke saath mehnat karegaa or jo fasal hogi uskaa aadha hissaa use mil jayega
 But after the closure of the note, there was neither easy work nor compost water was available for working in the fields
 ab ghar main aataa chaaval sab kuch khatm ho chukaa tha
 500 notes given in exchange for a five-day wage
 This week, when the entire opposition in Parliament was uniting against Modi and campaigning against the closure of the note, Naumi Lal was laboring with a man unaware of all this
 Was building a new house
 naumilal khush tha kii aise mushkil dinon main 5 din kii dihadi mil gai
 But after five days, when the man has put four old notes of ₹ 500 in the name of wages on Naumi Lal's hand, Naumi Lal's face is gone
 lekin us aadmi ne kaha ki abhi uske paas dene ko nae note nahin hai or vah puraane note ko apane bank le jaakar badalawa saktaa he yaa apane khate main jamaa kar saktaa he
 Nobody told this to Naumilal that the cooperative banks can neither change nor deposit old notes
 uske baad vah apana purana note lekar do bainkon main gaya lekin uskaa number aane se pehle hi bank ne kaha ki ab paise khatm ho gaye
 When the employee of the co-operative bank told him that the last date for exchange of notes was still till date, in disbelief he once again went to Punjab National Bank where finally his note was changed
 lekin naumilal jaise tamaam aise log hai jinka khaataa apnecoparative bankke alaava kahin nahin hai
 Mr
 Kishan, an 80-year-old elder, is surprised that the same bank, which had given the note last month, is now refusing to take it back
 coparative bank ke karmchaaree apane graahakon ko jawaab dete dete pareshaan hai
 They are afraid that now the trust of the people will be lost from the cooperative and even the old customers will leave them
 puraane noton kaa kya karen ?sarkaar bhale hi daawa kar rahi ho kii khaad or beej ke liye kisaanon kii madad kii jaaegi, lekin hakeekat kuch or he
 Kashi Prasad Yadav, Secretary of the Cooperative Society, which sells fertilizers to farmers in Uttar Pradesh, says that the bank accounts of fertilizer-selling societies are also in these cooperative banks, if they start giving fertilizer by taking old notes from farmers, then those old notes What to do, because the cooperative bank is not ready to take old notes from them too
 lakhanu jila sahakaari bank ke karmchaaree ashish kumaar bataate hai ki sarkaar ke is kadam se sahakaari bainkon se logon kaa bharosa uth gaya he
 There are many farmers in the village who do not have an account anywhere other than the cooperative bank
 kaala dhan rokane ke liye uthaaya gaya kadam aise logon ke liye bahut baari pad rahaa he
 Farmers are leaving the job of farming to change two thousand rupees and are engaged in the line of banks and there is no one to listen to them

 rahul gandhi ke vaade ke anusaar madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh ke baad ab rajasthan main mukhyamantri ashok gahalot kisaanon ko karj maafee kaa tohfa dene ke liye guna bhaag kar rahe hai
 About 59 lakh farmers of Rajasthan have a bank loan of 99 thousand crores
 rajasthan main mukhyamantri ke rup main ashok gahalot or up mukhyamantri ke rup main sachin payalat ko shapath liye 2 din ho gaye, lekin abhi tak donon rahul gandhi kaa kisaanon se kiya vaada nibhaane ke chakkar main hisaab kitaab lekar baithe hue hai
 In a meeting of officers with the Chief Secretary, Ashok Gehlot made a lot of efforts for the loan waiver of the farmers, but so far no solution has been found
 samasya yah he ki rajasthan sarkaar ke paas paisa he hi nahin
 In the current budget, the government's borrowing limit is 28 thousand crores, while the Vasundhara government has so far taken a loan of 24,557 thousand crores
 aise main karj maafee ke liye paisa kahaan se aae yah bada sirdard bana hua he
 Loan on more than 58 lakh farmers The state has a loan of 99 thousand 995 crore on 58 lakh 85 thousand 961 farmers
 isamen alpakaaleen karj 47 lakh kisaanon ke upar 77 hajaar 668 karod kaa he
 Now the government has to decide whether to forgive the entire debt or to forgive the short-term debt
 maaf kiye jane vaale karj kii seemaa kitni rakhni he kyonki rajasthan ke chunaav main rahul gandhi ne iskaa vaada to kiya tha lekin yah nahin bataaya tha kitna maaf karenge or kin kin kisaanon kaa maaf karenge
 Ashok Gehlot is saying that we will fulfill what has happened to Rahul Gandhi

 Whose debt is forgiven, not whose government has become, as well as the officials of the Government of Rajasthan have started working with cooperative banks to prepare a loan waiver
 rajasthan main 18 lakh se adhik kisaanon ne 30 hajaar karod sahakaari rin bainkon se rin le rakhaa he
 While about 33 lakh farmers from commercial banks have taken a loan of 54 thousand crore rupees
 iske alaava nae-puraane nijee bank, oversij bank or duusare rashtriyakrut bainkon se bhi kisaanon ne lone le rakhaa he
 The government is doing this on the basis of which farmers whose loan is to be forgiven
 up mukhyamantri sachin payalat kaa kahana he ki 10 din ke andar ham vaada puraa karenge
 These possible terms have come out in the Pilot and Gehlot's day-long discussion on the blueprint

 aisa hi daawa karne vaala ek massej pichley kuch maheenon se soshal media par viral ho rahaa he
 If you are not sure, just try typing the Story of Birba on Google
 tamaam website, fasebuk ke pej or twitor ke post mil jaaenge jo assam ke rahane vaale ek bir bahadur gurung kii aisi hi ek maarmik kahani bayaan karte hai
 According to this story, Bir Bahadur Gurung's childhood name was Birba and he was given Bravery Award by the President for bravery at an early age
 is kahani main na sirf birba ke bachapan kii ghatnaon kaa vistaar se varnasaa he balki yah bhi bataaya gaya he ki kaise kargil kii ladaai ke dauraan antim saason tak ladate hue unhone desh ke liye praan nyochaavar kar die
 This story, written by an unknown author, claims that even after getting the Param Vir Chakra for this heroism, the country has forgotten his family and now his widow has to work from house to house in a city in Assam
 kahani yah bhi daawa karti he ki bharat ke log birba ko bhul gaye, lekin canada kii kitabon main unki kahani skulon main padhai ja rahi he
 When "aaj Tak" began to find out the truth of this story of Birba, the first thing to notice was that everywhere the words of the story are exactly the same
 yani kisi ek vyakti kii likhi is dastaan ko hi log danaadan share kiye ja rahe hai
 It was not at all difficult to find out whether someone named Bir Bahadur Gurung got Paramveer Chakra or not
 bahaduree or balidaan ke liye diya jane vaala sarvocch puraskaar paramveer chakra bharat main ab tak sirf 21 logon ko hi mila he or unamem kisi kaa naam bir bahadur gurung nahin he
 The story also describes such things as walking along the river with friends in Birba's childhood as if the writer had seen everything with his eyes
 lekin hairaan karne vaali baat ye he ki bir bahadur gurung assam ke kis shahar yaa gaanv main rahete the iske bare main bhi kuch nahin likhaa he
 There is no mention of even the district
 bachapan main raashtrapati dwaara bahaduree puraskaar die jane kii baat kahi gai he or ye bhi kaha gaya he ki birba rajpath par hathi par chadh kar ghume
 But nothing has been written about which year he won the gallantry award
 kahani main likhaa he ki bahaduree puraskaar milane ke chaudaa saalon baad bir bahadur gurung kargil ke yuddh main shahid ho gaye
 Accordingly, he may have received the Bravery Award in 1984 or 1985
 lekin jaanch karne par pataa chalaa ki in donon saalon main kisi bir bahadur gurung yaa birba ko rashtrapita se bahaduree paraskaar nahin mila tha
 The viral post stated that Bir Bahadur Gurung was martyred during the Kargil war on "peak Tololing", but Major Rajesh Adhikari was martyred in the battle of Peak Tololing, who was given the Mahavir Chakra posthumously
 yahaan shahid hone waalon main bir bahadur gurung naam kaa koi sainik nahin tha
 a soldier named Bir Bahadur Gurung was martyred in the war with Pakistan, but this incident happened in 1971 and not during the Kargil war
 bir bahadur gurung naam ke anya sainik ko 1968 main shaury puraskaar mila tha, lekin wo shahid nahin hue the
 Apart from this, he was not even a resident of Assam
 jaahir he juthi kahani gadhane vaale ne kahin se naam or kahin se koi ghatana uthaakar jod diya he
 At the end of the story it is claimed that he got all this information from Major General Harsh Kakkar
 lekin major kakkar ne twitor par khud is baat kaa khandan kiya he
 He has said that- 'this message is a lie and some mischievous element has put my name in this message
 main kabhi aisi kahani nahin likhata
 'the most strange thing is that according to this fake story, the story of Birba's bravery is taught in a book in English in the eighth grade in Canada
 ye baat samaj ke pare he ki jab bir bahadur gurung kaa canada se koi lenaa-dena nahin tha to unki kahani canada kii kitabon main kyon padhai jaaegi
 When asked about this, the army spokesman said, "the army makes all arrangements to take care of the family of its people
" isamen ho saktaa he kabhi koi kami rah jaae, lekin is kahani ko vah sach nahin kah sakate
 There is no doubt that this story of Bir Bahadur Gurung is completely false and concocted to reduce the morale of the Indian Army

 unhone kaha ‘abhi tak mujhe praapt jaankaree ke anusaar inamen se ek kii hatya kar di gai he jabaki do anya abhi bhi unki giraft main hai
 The 'foreign minister said' this kind of barbaric, rude and ruthless action is reminiscent of the medieval era

 Asked whether the subject would be taken up during indo-pak Secretary-level talks, Krishna said that all issues related to the relationship between the two countries would be raised, including the killing of Sikhs

 piem modi ne pichley dinon chaatro ke saath ek video conferencing ke dauraan dislexia par baat karte hue kuch aisa kaha jiske chalate soshal media par unki kaaphi aalochana hui
 It is believed that PM Modi targeted Congress President Rahul Gandhi and his mother Sonia Gandhi on the pretext of dyslexia
 piem modi kii is tarah kii tippanee logon ko kuch khaas pasand nahi ai or unki khub aalochana bhi hui
 In fact, in a video conference held for the 'smart India Hackathon 2019' last Saturday, a student from Dehradun told PM Narendra Modi (dyslexia Children) that this program is about to read- It can also be beneficial for those who have trouble writing
 chaatra ne piem modi se kaha, "hamaare paas dislexia peediton bacchon ke liye ek idia he, jo padhane-likhane main behad dhime hote hai, lekin unka creativity level kaaphi acha hota he
 We have seen this film in 'taare Zameen Par'
 " is par piem modi ne chaatra se poocha ki kya yah program 40-50 saal ke bachche ke kaam bhi aayega? chaatra ke haa main jawaab dene par piem ne kaha phir to aise bachche kii maa bahut khush ho jaaegi
 However, laughter flew into jokes, but dyslexia is not a joke
 yahaan par ham aapako dislexia ke bare main bataa rahe hai
 Dyslexia is a learning disorder in which a child or person with this problem has difficulty reading, writing and memorizing it
 haalanki dislexia kii vajah se unki buddhi yaa gyaan par koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 Children and elders suffering from dyslexia have a lot of difficulty in daily life such as writing and reading in school and office
 in sabake baavjood dislexia dysorder se peedit vyakti bahut creative ho sakate hai
 You must have seen Aamir Khan's film Taare Zameen Par in 2007
 us film main ek baccha he jiskaa naam ishan he or vah dislexia se peedit hota he
 Its treatment is explained in the film, in real life also dyslexia is treated like this
 bacchon ko dislexia se baahar ke liye unhen har shabdon ko samajhane ke liye chitron or basic baton ko samajhane kii jarurat hoti he
 If someone is suffering from dyslexia, they should be given enough time and encouragement to understand things
 isse bhi jaruri unke saath dhairya se pesh aana chahie
 Dyslexia is one of the most common learning disorders that affects 3-7% of people, (traits in upto 17-20%)
 It is genetic (heritable) that affects reading, writing & hence learning skills but not a marker for intelligence

 The party says that the Congress will get an answer in 2014

 Naqvi said that the Congress' nervousness is palpable and the Congress is plagued by Modi-phobia
 congress kaa modi par tikhaa praharisase pehle congress ne shuukravaar ko modi samarthakon ko yah kah kar chidhaane kii koshish kii ki desh kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karne vaale netaa ghode par nahin 'bhainse' par aaenge
 Congress leader Rashid Alvi even compared Modi to Yamraj
 congress ke pravaktaa raashid alvi ne samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha, 'yadi rahul (siaiai kii aam sabha main) modi ke bare main sanket de rahe hote to vah ghoda nahin hota, balki bhainsa hota
 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said on Thursday that it should not be expected that someone riding a horse will come and fix all things
 guuruuvaar ko hi modi ne ek pustak vimochan samaaroh main 'desh kaa karj' utaarne kii ichha jataa kar pradhanmantri banane kii apni abhilaashaa kaa ishaara kiya tha
 Taking a sarcasm at this, Alvi said, 'if Modi wants to come to Delhi and repay the debt of the country, then he should pray to God for this
 ' Tata Sons' board meetings are often on quiet and pre-determined issues
 lekin somvaar ko hui baithak saamaanya nahin thi jiske baad sirus mistre ko samooh ke chairman pad se hataane kii chaunkaane vaali khabar ai
 Exclusive information from NDTV from two sources on the board of Tata Sons (one of which was present at the Monday meeting) shows that the decision to remove Mistri led to a furious and unpredictable atmosphere inside the boardroom
 mistre ko baahar kiya janaa shaayad jaanboojhkar board ke agenda main shaamil nahin tha
 a source told NDTV that it was brought to the meeting under the category of any other item of issues fixed for the board meeting
 jab baithak main ise laayaa gaya to kaha jaataa he ki mistre ne yah kehete hue ki yah kanoonee rup se galat kadam he, iskaa virodh kiya
 He is said to have cited the Tata Rule Book, saying that 15 days notice should be given before any such issue was brought before the board, so that he could prepare to put forth his time
 uske baad board ne unase kaha ki unhone is faisle ke samarthan main kanoonee salaah lee he
 That legal advice was also shown to Mistri
 board unase lagaataar kahata rahaa ki yah koi adaalat kii sunwaayee nahin he
 On this issue Cyrus Mistri said that he would challenge this decision
 reporton ke mutabik vah is masale par mangalvaar ko bombai hai court kaa darwaja khatkhata sakate hai
 Earlier, six of the nine-member board voted in favor of his removal
 do sadsy anupasthit rahe
 As the ninth member, Mistri refused to participate in the process
 haalanki is ghatnakram ke baavjood vah company ke nideshak hone ke saath-saath tata board ke sadsy bane hue hai
 The comments board ke ek sutara ne NDTV ko bataaya ki mistre ko hataae jane ke masale par hafton yaa sambhavatya maheenon se vichaar kiya ja rahaa tha
 The decision was taken "not because of any controversy" while his pathetic performance as CEO
 unhone kaha ki is vakt tata kii anek companiyon main se keval do hi laabh main hai baaki sangharsh kar rahi hai
 When asked why Mistri was removed in a manner contrary to the tradition of the Tata group, the insider said globally that the 'guillotine' approach is adopted when such top-ranking people are removed
 NDTV ko tata sans ke board ke do sutron (inamen se ek somvaar kii baithak main maujuud tha) se mili exclusive jaankaree se pataa chalata he ki mistre ko hataae jane ke faisle se bordroom ke andar ugr or apratyaashit maahaul dekhne ko mila
 The exclusion of Mistri was perhaps not deliberately included in the board's agenda
 ek sutara ne NDTV ko bataaya ki board kii baithak ke liye tay muddon ke kisi bhi anya item kii shrenee ke tahat ise baithak main laayaa gaya
 When it was brought to the meeting, it is said that Mistri opposed it, saying that it was a legally incorrect step
 bataaya jaataa he ki unhone tata rule book kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki board ke saamne aise kisi masale ko laae jane se pehle 15 din kaa notice diya janaa chahie, taaki itane samay main vah apni baat rakhane ke liye taiyaari kar sakate the
 The board then told them that they had taken legal advice in support of this decision
 mistre ko vah kanoonee salaah bhi dikhaai gai
 The board kept telling him that this was not a court hearing
 is masale par sirus mistre ne kaha ki vah is nirnay ko chunauti denge
 According to reports, he may knock the door of Bombay High Court on Tuesday on this issue
 isse pehle nau sadasyeey board main se chah sadasyon ne unako hataae jane ke paksh main vot diya
 Two members were absent
 nawein sadsy ke rup main mistre ne is prakriya main hissaa lene se inkaar kar diya
 However, despite this development, he remains a director of the company as well as a member of the Tata board
 tippaniyan a board source told NDTV that the issue of Mistri's removal was being considered for weeks or possibly months
 yah nirnay ''kisi vivaad kii vajah se nahin liya gaya'' jabaki siio ke rup main unke dayaneey pradarshan ke kaaran liya gaya
 He said that at the moment only two of the Tata companies are in profit, the rest are struggling
 jab unase poocha gaya ki mistre ko tata group kii parampara ke vipareet is tarah se kyon hataaya gaya to andruni sutara ne vaishvik hawala dete hue kaha ki jab is tarah ke sheersh padasth logon ko hataaya jaataa he to 'gilotin' drushtikon apanaaya jaataa he

 vikiliks ke sansthaapak julinay asanje kii mushkilen kam hone kaa naam nahin le rahi hai
 In a major setback to wikileaks founder Julian Assange, a British court today dismissed a second application for cancellation of a warrant from Assange
 iskaa matlab yah he ki asanje yadi apane maujuuda thikaane ecuador ke duutavas se baahar kadam rakhte hai to unhen giraftaar kar liya jayega
 Assange has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy since 2012
 jaj emma arbathanot ne asanje ke vakeelon kii is daleel ko khaarij kar diya ki 2012 main jari warrant ko barkaraar rakhana ab janhit main nahin he
 During his legal battle against extraditing Sweden, Assange violated the terms of bail, after which the warrant was issued against him
 varisht jila jaj emma arbathanot ne westminster magistrate adaalat main kaha ki vah asanje kii kanoonee team kii is daleel se santusht nahin hai ki jamaanat kii sharton ke ulanghan ke aarope main unhen giraftaar karne kii koshish karnaa janhit main nahin he
 Judge Emma said, 'I think the arrest is a reasonable answer, although Assange has limited his independence for many years
 ’ unhone kaha ki prativaadee ko kaha gaya ki vah adaalat aakar apni pasand ke parinaamon kaa saamana karen
 They should have the courage to do so
 is maamle main aage kadam badhanaa janhit ke khilaaf nahin he
 Swedish prosecutors have closed the investigation against Assange, but he may be arrested if he steps out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in Knightsbridge, London
 tippaniyan Assange's lawyers demanded that the warrant be withdrawn as Sweden no longer wanted his extradition
 lekin jaj ne pichley hafte bhi asanje kii yah arji khaarij kar di thi
 Assange's lawyers had argued that the continuance of the warrant issued in 2012 is no longer in the public interest
 sweden pratyrpit kiye jane ke khilaaf apni kanoonee ladaai ke dauraan asanje ne jamaanat kii sharton kaa ulanghan kiya tha, jiske baad unke khilaaf yah warrant jari kiya gaya tha
 Judge Emma Arbuthnot dismissed Assange's lawyers' argument that the continuance of the 2012 warrant was no longer in the public interest
 sweden pratyrpit kiye jane ke khilaaf apni kanoonee ladaai ke dauraan asanje ne jamaanat kii sharton kaa ulanghan kiya tha, jiske baad unke khilaaf yah warrant jari kiya gaya tha
 Senior District Judge Emma Arbaughnott said in Westminster Magistrate's Court that he was not satisfied with Assange's legal team's plea that it was not in the public interest to try to arrest him for violating bail conditions
 jaj emma ne kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki giraftaar ek uchit jawaab he, haalanki asanje ne apni aazaadee kai saalon ke liye simit kar lee he
 'he said that the defendant was asked to come to court and face the consequences of his choice
 unamem aisa karne kaa saahas hona chahie
 Taking further steps in this matter is not against public interest
 swedish abhiyojkon ne asanje ke khilaaf jaanch band kar di he, lekin landan ke nitsbrij sthit ecuador duutavas se vah baahar nikalate hai to unhen giraftaar kiya ja saktaa he
 The comments asanje ke vakeelon ne maang kii thi ki warrant waapas le liya jaae kyonki sweden ab unka pratyrpan nahin chahta
 But the judge last week rejected Assange's application
 asanje ke vakeelon ne daleel di thi ki 2012 main jari warrant ko barkaraar rakhana ab janhit main nahin he
 During his legal battle against extraditing Sweden, Assange violated the terms of bail, after which the warrant was issued against him
 varisht jila jaj emma arbathanot ne westminster magistrate adaalat main kaha ki vah asanje kii kanoonee team kii is daleel se santusht nahin hai ki jamaanat kii sharton ke ulanghan ke aarope main unhen giraftaar karne kii koshish karnaa janhit main nahin he
 Judge Emma said, 'I think the arrest is a reasonable answer, although Assange has limited his independence for many years

 com / 9uyinb9b4u The kind of allegations that BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has written to Prime Minister Modi against Governor of Reserve Bank of India, Raghuram Rajan, read that it seems that he is talking about the dismissal of a criminal
 bhashaa or tark ke lihaaz ye patr bataata he ki kisi sanstha ke prati kitna sammaan rah gaya he
 It has even been written that Rajan is not entirely Indian in mind
 bhartiya arthvyavastha ko barbaad kar rahe hai
 On completion of two years, the Modi government is giving its minute by minute statistics, while a BJP MP is attacking the Governor of the Reserve Bank and saying that industrial development is negative
 rajan kii vajah se berojgaare badi he
 In this letter sent to the Prime Minister, it is written that he should immediately remove Raghuram Rajan from the post of Governor
 swami ne kaha ki main bhartiya arthvyavastha ko nuksaan pahunchane ke dow
 i am surprised by Rajan's thoughtful intrigue
 swami ne kaha ki pichley do saal main saarvajanik kshetra ke bainkon main bed lons dogune hokar 3
 5 lakh crores
 dow
 Rajan's steps have made me believe that he is trying more to disrupt the Indian economy
 unhone mahangaai kaa hawala dete hue byaaj daren lagaataar badaye rakhin jabaki vitt mantralay or udyog vikaas ko tezi dene ke liye unase byaaj dar kam karne kaa aagrah karte rahe
 The charge of conspiracy to ruin the economy is very serious
 rajyasabha main vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha tha ki main swami ke anubhav or gyaan ke bare main bhaleebhanti jaanata hum
 Swami is a noted economist
 vitt mantri swami kii tarif kar rahe hai or swami rajan par hamale kar rahe hai
 Jaitley and Rajan have different policies as finance minister, some things have also been made public but Jaitley has never crossed the scope
 ve hameshaa apni seemaa main rahakar ishaaron main apni baat kehete rahe hai
 Talking to women journalists in the Finance Minister Indian Women Press Corps on Monday said that the relationship between us is very mature
 swami ne apane patr main likhaa he ki byaaz dar badhaakar chote or manzole udyogon ko nuksaan pahunchaa diya
 This step is like killing a sick so that his body temperature can be dropped
 sarkaar ke daavon ke anusaar agar bhartiya arthvyavastha acha kar rahi he to isaki giravat, hatya or saazish ko lekar ek shaks kii talash kyon kerani padi he
 Is Swamy looking for a villain on the pretext of which to put the accountability of the economy down
 na to pradhanmantri or na hi vitt mantri ne saarvajanik taur par swami ke bayaan kii ninda kii he, yaa usase kinaaraa kiya he
 Prior to Swamy, BJP MP Murli Manohar Joshi has also questioned Rajan's citizenship in 2013
 oktober 2013 main waal street jarnal nupur acharya kii report ke anusaar rajan ne mumbai main kaha tha ki main bhartiya naagarik hum or hameshaa bhartiya naagarik rahoonga
 i am proud to be an Indian citizen
 tab rajan ke kaha tha ki unhen koi rose ek mail bhejtaa he or poochta he ki bataaiye ki aap bhartiya hai yaa nahin
 He did not name the sender of the email
 raghuram rajan kii kyaati is baat ko lekar he ki unhone 2005 main america ke fedral reserve ke purv chairman ke sammaan main bulaae gaye sammelan main bhavishyavaanee kar di thi ki duniya main mandi aa rahi he

 On April 23, 2016, Bloomberg conducted a survey

 His term expires in September
 itimarket dot kaam ne pathakon ke bich ek survey kiya he
 According to this survey published on Tuesday, 69 percent people have given 10 out of 10 numbers
 87 pratishat ne kaha he ki ve chaahate hai ki ve garvanar pad par bane rahen
 On the question that Swami wants to send Rajan to Chicago, 86 percent of the people have said that Chicago should not be sent
 78 pratishat logon ne rajan ke bare main swami kii tippanee se asahmati jataai he
 9168 readers have taken part in this survey
 swami ne 18 sitambar, 2015 ke din da hindu main ek lekh likhaa
 It was titled The way out of the economic tailspin '
 swami ne likhaa ki arthvyavastha ek bade sankat kii ore bad rahi he or 2016 kii shuruyaat tak arthvyavastha krash ho jaaegi
 Three days before this article, Swami wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and targeted Rajan
 swami ne likhaa ki main aapako ye bataane ko vivash hum ki arthvyavastha ladkadaane hi vaali he
 If the right steps are not taken, a major crash between November and February 2016 will not be avoided
 farvari tak arthvyavastha ke krash kar jane kii baat kahi thi
 Half May is gone
 kya hamaari arthvyavastha krash kar gai he
 Why would Swami deliberately raise the sky
 sookshm, laghu or madhyam udyog mantralay kii website par jaakar hamane dekha ki kya rajan kii vajah se chote str ke udyog dhandhe chaupat ho gaye hai
 The 2015-16 annual report of this ministry stated that from April 2015 to September 2015, the growth rate of micro, small and medium industries was 18
 74 fisadi rahi he
 This increase was 17 percent in 2014-15
 2013-14 main 12 pratishat kii dar se vruddhi hui thi
 The comments bharat sarkaar kii website galat aankade de rahi he yaa swami galat bol rahe hai
 In his mind of 30 November 2015, the Prime Minister had said that we have established Mudra Bank, it has started well but the pace is not the way i want
 man kii baat main pradhanmantri ne bataaya tha ki us vakt tak 66 lakh logon ko 42 hazaar karod rupee pradhanmantri mudra yojana ke tahat mil chuke hai
 Is the Prime Minister's mind right or Swami is speaking his mind that due to Rajan's policies, small industries are not able to borrow on interest
 hamaari research ke mutabik jab rajan ne 2013 main kaarykaal sambhala tha tab bainkon ke liye byaaz dar 7
 50 percent, 6 at the moment
 50 pratishat he
 There is a shortfall of about one percent
 rajan ne apane kaarykaal main paanch baar byaaz daron main kami kii he
 Swami does not have any lord but is he dragging the lord of his government also on the pretext of the lord of the lord who is attacking the lord? Does the government also think of Swamy about Rajan? modi sarkaar do saal puure hone par minute minute apni kamyaabi ke aankade de rahi he, vahiin bijepi ke ek saansad reserve bank ke garvanar par hamalaa kar bataa rahe hai ki audyogic vikaas negative he
 Unemployment has increased due to Rajan
 pradhanmantri ko bheje is patr main likhaa he ki ve raghuram rajan ko garvanar ke pad se turant hataaen
 Swami said that i would like to harm the Indian economy
 rajan kii sochi samajhi saazish se hairaan hum
 Swamy said that in the last two years, bad loans in public sector banks have doubled to 3
 5 lakh karod ho gaye hai
 Dr
 rajan ke kadamon se meraa ye vishwaas ban rahaa he ki wo bhartiya arthvyavastha main baadha pahunchane kii zyaada koshish kar rahe hai
 He kept raising interest rates continuously citing inflation, while the Finance Ministry and the industry urged him to reduce the interest rate to speed up development
 arthvyavastha ko barbaad karne kii saazish kaa aarope behad gambhir he
 In the Rajya Sabha, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said that i know well about Swami's experience and knowledge
 swami ek janemaane arthshaastri hai
 The Finance Minister is praising Swamy and attacking Swami Rajan
 vitt mantri ke taur par jetali or rajan kii nitiyon main fark rahaa he, kuch baaten saarvajanik bhi hui hai magar jetali ne kabhi dayera paar nahin kiya
 He has always been within his limits and said his gestures
 somvaar ko vitt mantri indian viman press kor main mahila patrakaron se baat karte hue kaha tha ki ham donon ke sambandh behad paripakv hai
 Swamy has written in his letter that small and medium industries have been harmed by increasing the rate of interest
 ye kadam aisa he jaise kisi biimaar kii hatya kar di jaae taaki uske sharir kaa taapmaana giraaya ja sake
 According to the claims of the government, if the Indian economy is doing well then why has it had to search for a person about its decline, murder and intrigue
 kya swami ke bahaane ek khalanaayak khoja rahaa he jis par arthvyavastha ke chaupat hone kii javabdehi daal di jaae
 Neither the Prime Minister nor the Finance Minister has publicly condemned, or condoned, Swamy's statement
 swami se pehle bijepi saansad murali manohar joshi bhi 2013 main rajan kii naagarikta par sawaal uthaa chuke hai
 According to the Wall Street Journal Nupur Acharya's report in October 2013, Rajan said in Mumbai that i am an Indian citizen and will always be an Indian citizen
 mujhe is bhartiya naagarik hone par garv he
 Then Rajan said that someone sends him a mail every day and asks if you are Indian or not
 unhone email bhejne vaale kaa naam nahin bataaya
 Raghuram Rajan's interest is that he predicted in a conference called in honor of the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve in 2005 that the world was going to recession

 Who can be upset by Raghuram Rajan's popularity and his active speaking on economic issues
 23 april 2016 ko bloomberg ne ek survey kiya tha
 In this, 13 out of 15 economists have said that Rajan will get another term as Governor
 unka kaarykaal sitambar main samaapt ho rahaa he
 etmarket
com has conducted a survey among readers
 mangalvaar ko chape is survey ke anusaar 69 pratishat logon ne unhone 10 main 10 number diye hai
 87 percent have said that they want them to continue as governor
 is sawaal par ki swami rajan ko chicago bhej dena chaahate hai, 86 pratishat logon ne kaha he ki chicago nahin bhejnaa chahie
 78 per cent of the people disagreed with Swamy's remarks about Rajan
 is survey main 9168 pathakon ne hissaa liya he
 Swami wrote an article in The Hindu on September 18, 2015
 iskaa sheershak tha The way out of the economic tailspin'
 Swamy wrote that the economy is heading towards a major crisis and by early 2016 the economy will crash
 is lekh se teen din pehle bhi swami ne pradhanmantri ko patr likhaa tha or rajan ko nishaanaa banaaya
 Swami wrote that i am forced to tell you that the economy is about to falter
 agar sahi kadam nahin uthaae gaye to november se lekar farvari 2016 ke bich ek bade krash ko taala nahin ja sakegaa
 There was talk of the economy crashing by February
 aadha may chalaa gaya
 Has our economy crashed
 swami kyon jaanboojh kar hauvva khadaa karenge
 By visiting the website of Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Industries, we saw whether due to Rajan, small scale business has been destroyed
 is mantralay kii 2015-16 kii salanaa report main kaha gaya he ki april 2015 se sitambar 2015 tak, sookshm, laghu or madhyam udyogon kii vikaas dar 18
 74%
 2014-15 main yah vruddhi 17 pratishat thi
 There was an increase of 12 percent in 2013-14
 tippaniyan The Indian government website is giving incorrect figures or the owner is misinformed
 30 november 2015 ke apane man kii baat main pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki hamane mudra bank kii sthapana kii he, isaki shuruyaat acchhee rahi he magar raftaar waisi nahin he jaisi main chahta hum
 In the matter of mind, the Prime Minister had said that till that time 66 lakh people have got 42 thousand crores under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana
 pradhanmantri kii man kii baat sahi he yaa swami apane man kii baat kar rahe hai ki rajan kii nitiyon ke kaaran chote udyogon byaaj par karz nahin le paa rahe hai
 According to our research, when Rajan took office in 2013, the interest rate for banks was 7
 50 pratishat thi, is vakt 6
 50 percent
 kareeb ek pratishat kii kami he
 Rajan has reduced interest rates five times during his tenure
 swami kaa koi swami nahin he lekin swami rigerv bank ke jis swami par hamale kar rahe hai uske bahaane kahin ve apni sarkaar ke swami ko bhi to nahin ghaseet rahe? kya rajan ke bare main swami kii soch sarkaar kii bhi he? The charge of conspiracy to ruin the economy is very serious

 Why would Swami deliberately raise the sky
 sookshm, laghu or madhyam udyog mantralay kii website par jaakar hamane dekha ki kya rajan kii vajah se chote str ke udyog dhandhe chaupat ho gaye hai
 The 2015-16 annual report of this ministry stated that from April 2015 to September 2015, the growth rate of micro, small and medium industries was 18
 74 fisadi rahi he
 This increase was 17 percent in 2014-15
 2013-14 main 12 pratishat kii dar se vruddhi hui thi
 The comments bharat sarkaar kii website galat aankade de rahi he yaa swami galat bol rahe hai
 In his mind of 30 November 2015, the Prime Minister had said that we have established Mudra Bank, it has started well but the pace is not the way i want
 man kii baat main pradhanmantri ne bataaya tha ki us vakt tak 66 lakh logon ko 42 hazaar karod rupee pradhanmantri mudra yojana ke tahat mil chuke hai
 Is the Prime Minister's mind right or Swami is speaking his mind that due to Rajan's policies, small industries are not able to borrow on interest
 hamaari research ke mutabik jab rajan ne 2013 main kaarykaal sambhala tha tab bainkon ke liye byaaz dar 7
 50 percent, 6 at the moment
 50 pratishat he
 There is a shortfall of about one percent
 rajan ne apane kaarykaal main paanch baar byaaz daron main kami kii he
 Swami does not have any lord but is he dragging the lord of his government also on the pretext of the lord of the lord who is attacking the lord? Does the government also think of Swamy about Rajan? swami ne apane patr main likhaa he ki byaaz dar badhaakar chote or manzole udyogon ko nuksaan pahunchaa diya
 This step is like killing a sick so that his body temperature can be dropped
 sarkaar ke daavon ke anusaar agar bhartiya arthvyavastha acha kar rahi he to isaki giravat, hatya or saazish ko lekar ek shaks kii talash kyon kerani padi he
 Is Swamy looking for a villain on the pretext of which to put the accountability of the economy down
 na to pradhanmantri or na hi vitt mantri ne saarvajanik taur par swami ke bayaan kii ninda kii he, yaa usase kinaaraa kiya he
 Prior to Swamy, BJP MP Murli Manohar Joshi has also questioned Rajan's citizenship in 2013
 to the Wall Street Journal Nupur Acharya report in October 2013, Rajan said in Mumbai that i am an Indian citizen and will always be an Indian citizen
 mujhe is bhartiya naagarik hone par garv he
 Then Rajan said that someone sends him a mail every day and asks if you are Indian or not
 unhone email bhejne vaale kaa naam nahin bataaya
 Raghuram Rajan's interest is that he predicted in a conference called in honor of the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve in 2005 that the world was going to recession

 Hello, i am Ravish Kumar
 madhya pradesh ke vyapam ghotaale kii vyapaktaa kii chapet main bijepi ke netaaon ke saath-saath rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke netaaon ke bhi naam aane lage hai
 For the past one year, this scam is only at the stage of investigation and the next day it reaches a new turning point
 vyavsaayik pariksha mandal yani vyapam medical, engineirag se lekar kai prakaar kii sarkari naukariyon main bhartee ko yojit karata he
 There have been about one and a half lakh recruitments through it
 unamem kitni vaazib hai or kitni nazaij ab to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa magar sandigdh to sab ho gaye hai
 This scene of water spraying by police pipes is outside the house of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan in Bhopal
 jab congress ke party ke netaa kyrkarta vyapam ghotaale ko lekar gheraav karne pahunch gaye
 On Friday morning, it was reported on several news channels that Pankaj Trivedi, one of the main accused in the Vyapam scam, has given a statement that he had helped to pass a person named Mihir in the job of food inspector in 2012
 kathith bayaan kii copy bhi channelon par chalane lagi, jisamen kaha gaya he ki mihir kii sifarish giraftaar purvamantri lakshmikant sharma ne kii thi, kyonki vah rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke bade padaadhikari suresh soni kaa kareebi tha
 Mihir was also an assistant to the former head of the RSS, the late KC Sudarshan
 is maamle main giraftaar hone ke baad is vakt mihir jamaanat par baahar he
 Sources in STF have told our colleague that the role of late leader Sudarshan or Soni cannot be ensured in this scam, so STF has not yet made him an accused
 pankaj trivedi hi vyapam kaa nideshak or pariksha niyantrak tha jo ab jail main he
 RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has said that the law will do its job, we are not worried
 chah july 2013 ko indore police ke ek chaape se yah ghotaalaa saamne aata he
 In August 2013 it is handed over to STF
 agast se lekar may tak is maamle main dhimi pragati ke kaaran is saal may main hoicourt apni nigaraanee main le letaa he or estf kii aalochana bhi karata he
 Not knowing how many Munna Bhai became doctors in a fake way
 yahi nahin ghoose dene vaale chaatro ko laabh pahunchane ke liye anya bhartee parikshaon ke bhi niyam badale gaye
 Till the year 2012, many recruits were from the concerned departments, but they were given to Vyapam
 sab inspect kii bhartee main 33 pratishat physical test ke anivaary the
 It was increased to 20 per cent in 2012 to benefit the allegedly bribe candidates and then in 2013 the physical test was completely abolished
 jab ghoose dene vaale chaatro ke sab inspector main nahin hue to kathith rup se unhen ek or mauka dene ke liye parivahan aarakshak kii vaikency nikaali gai
 Physical test was also mandatory for the recruitment of this RTO constable
 2012 main is niyam ko hi samaapt kar diya gaya
 Till January 2012, police was recruited by Transport Constable
 magar july 2012 main 8000 padon kii bhartee kaa jimmaa vyapam ko saunp diya gaya
 It is also printed in the newspapers of Madhya Pradesh that some rules for the recruitment of transport constables were made in such a way that only people of Madhya Pradesh get jobs
 magar jab yah pataa chalaa ki duusare rajyon ke parikshaarthi zyada ghoose dete hai to is naukari ke liye anivaary do niyamon ko bhi badla gaya
 In the eighties, the rule made by Arjun Singh required registration in the state employment office before the job and in 98, Digvijay Singh made the rule that the tenth and twelfth pass should be from Madhya Pradesh
 pehle rojgaar karyaalay main panjikaran vaala niyam july 2012 main badla gaya, phir janvari 2013 main dasvi barahavin paas vaala niyam samaapt kar diya gaya
 Then there were seven and a half thousand recruitments
 vyapam ghotaale kaa ek or pahalu he, soochna kaa adhikaar kanoon
 For the first time, it has been used to bribe and throw dust in the eyes of the system
 jin chaatro ne ghoose di unase kaha gaya ki ve apni uttar pustika khaali chhod aaen
 These students were tampered with in computers and passed by numbers
 magar inaki copy par to tha zero
 An idea was then drawn that they all asked for their answer sheets under RTI
 jise optic marking shit kehete hai
 After the result, the shells were made on the north booklet and the copy was submitted
 is str ke karaamaat hue hai
 While Pankaj Trivedi was the director of Vyapam, the RTI of those students who had given bribe or they all passed in Vyapam was approved
 jaanch chal rahi he or faisla nahin aayaa he, isliye jahaan jahaan kathith lagaana chhot gaya he, vahaan-vahaan kathith kaa prayog maan liya jaae
 Pankaj Trivedi's brother Piyush Trivedi was the Chancellor of Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology
 sudhir sharma jo bijepi ke padaadhikari the or ek teacher se mining tikun tip ban gaye in dinon faraar hai or madhya pradesh kii police abhi tak nahin pakad pai he
 Many references to the relationship between Sudhir Sharma and Jail Minister Laxmikant Sharma have come in the media
 kathith rup se
 Now to take this one more aspect into consideration, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Mriduldhar v
 Government of India that regulators should be made to monitor medical institutions
 is faisle ke baad admician or fee regulatory cameti eexr si banaai jaati he
 Its chairman is made Harshavardhan Tiwari who held this post from 2007 to 2013
 digvijay singh sarkaar ne is harshavardhan tiwari ko kai tarah kii aniyamittaaon or akushalta ke aarope main bhopal vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati pad se barkhaast kar diya tha
 The golden quadrangle of the names and handiwork of the people involved in this scam, indicates so much that this scam is not the handiwork of the misguided mind of any clergy, peon
 ise anjaam dene vaale raajnneetik prishthbhumi kaa laabh uthaate rahe or laabh pahunchaate bhi rahe
 Scam has happened because Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan himself has said that one thousand recruitments have become illegal
 yah hamaare maathe par kalank he
 Rajnath Singh is also vigorously defending
 congress sibiai jaanch kii magha kar rahi he
 The students who were rightfully killed during these years, robbed of their dreams, are not even worth seeking

 ) Before joining the Congress, BJP rebel MP Shatrughan Sinha has once again targeted PM Modi
 unhone (shatrughan Sinha)piem modi (PM Modi) ko salaah dete hue silsilewar tareeke se teen twit kiye
 In his first tweet, he said that the honorable outgoing Sarji (PM Modi), after his speeches, stop spending money behind various challenges and sponsored public to win his accolades
 aapke bhaashan main hameshaa se tathyon kii kami rahi he
 In another tweet, Shatrughan Sinha said that these days you are making people more and more irritable
 main aapke dwaara kiye jane vaale iviem gadabadi or aapke ghamand ke baavjood main aapkaa hitaishi hum
 Now on this one occasion, i would like to give you a suggestion that you should get straight and walk straight
 Honble outgoing Sirji
 Why are you wasting so much money on different channels and on the paid and choreographed crowd who chant your name at any given time - during, before & after your speeches on the signal of the conductors
 Your rhetorics / speeches lack content and depththese days and have gone to the extent of becoming highly repetitive and irritating
 Sirji, i still remain your well wisher despite your EVM misuse and in-spite of all your arrogance
 My humble suggestion for you at this eleventh hour would be to become straight and go straight
 Shatrughan Sinha advised the PM not to go to the page news channel
 aapako vaastavik press conference par janaa chahie
 Where Ravish Kumar and Prasoon Vajpayee Jesse are journalists
 jinhen kharida nahin ja saktaa he or vah aapse raashtra kii ruchi se jude sahi sawaal puchhegein
 Should go to a press that is not spooned and cannot be silenced
 Don't hire or go for paid channels
 Instead go for a real and genuine press conference with people like Raveesh Kumar, Prasun Vajpayee etc
 who can't be bought can question you in the larger interest of the nation
 Go for the Press who are not sycophants & can't be silenced tell that he has been targeting the party and its leadership for many years since Sinha was sidelined to BJP MP from Patna Sahib
 party ne abhi tak unke khilaaf koi anushaasanak karrwai nahin kii
 At the same time, the party has given ticket to Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad from his seat this time
 sinha ne iske saath hi twit kiyatha ki raajnneetik kariyar ke is mode par yah hairaan kar dene vaala kadam he
 However, this can only be expected under the dictatorial rule of One Man Show and Two Man Army
 yah kadam apmaanajak or sharmnaak he
 He also wrote that Lal Krishna Advani and other senior leaders Murali Manohar Joshi and Shanta Kumar have been insulted
 isse puure desh ko dukh hua he
 People are shocked by this decision

 -input IANS se On the silver screen, the women of 'gulab Gang' are making headlines these days for their bravery and courage
 lekin madhya pradesh kii adivasee mahilaayein beete do saalon se apni himmat or lathi ke jor par sharaabiyon ko chaiyn nahin lene de rahi hai
 The fear of the sticks of these women is so much that on seeing them, the senses of the alcoholics are destroyed
 apni sharaab virdohi muhim ke aakraamak tevar ke chalate mahilaon kii yah ‘lathi gang’ ilaake main bahut lokapriy ho gai he
 In the tribal-dominated Jhabua district of western Madhya Pradesh, these days there is a boom of lathi gang of tribal women
 sharaabiyon ke liye aantak kaa paryaay ban chuki in mahilaon kii sakriyata kaa yah alam he ki gaanv main 90 se 95 fisadi logon ne sharaab se tauba kar lee he
 In the last two years, the impact of the work of these women has become so deep that upon seeing them, the alcoholics remember their grandmother
 madhya pradesh ke jhabua jile ke gram navapada kii in mahilaon ne gaanv main purushon kii sharaab pine kii aadat se ho rahi barbaadi se pareshaan hokar samooh banaaya
 The group met and discussed the plan to make the village alcohol-free and decided that they would have to pick up sticks to challenge the alcoholism of men
 apni yojana ke mutabik mahilaon ne lathidhari gang banaakar sharaabiyon ke ghar-ghar jaakar dastak di or is prakaar kuch hi dinon main purush sharaab se munh modane lage
 These days, when some victims of alcohol addiction try to covertly drink alcohol, as soon as they get information, gangs of lathiched women reach the spot as per their action plan and the alcoholic is put under so much pressure that they Leaves forever
 ye mahilaaye sharaabiyon par jurmaana bhi lagaati hai
 The illiterate tribal women, who had been mobilized to root out the social evil like alcohol, had lathi sticks to get rid of the evil addiction of men, and this led to happy results
 ab tak gaanv kii 90 mahilaayein is gang main bhartee ho chuki hai, jo apane gaanv ke saath aas-paas ke paanch-chah gaanvon ke sharaabiyon ke liye bhay kaa doosraa naam ban gai hai
 Other villagers are very happy about this role of women, they say that earlier the men of their families used to spend money on drinking liquor
 ab vah rupaya bacchon kii padhai va ghar kii khushhaali par kharch hota he
 These women also do not hesitate to drive the alcoholics out of the village on the basis of sticks if needed
 lathi ke sahare gaanv ko sharaab mukt karne ke sankalp ke saath aage badhane vaali lathi gang kii mahilaayein apane bheetar naitik shakti banaae rakhane ke liye niyamit rup se havan karti hai
 For this, he has also built a havan kund
 iske alaava ve prarthana ke saath apni saathi mahilaon kaa tilak lagaakar abhishek karti he, taaki unki gang kaa aatmavishvaas barkaraar rahe va unamem bikharaav naa ho
 These women who take sticks for the well being of the village are proud of their courage and courage
 lathigang kii adhyaksh tejubai kahati hai, ‘pehle purushon kaa samooh banaaya tha par vah nahin chalaa, phir hamane mahilaon kaa samooh banaaya
 There are 200-250 families in our village, all the men of the village used to drink a lot of alcohol
 gehun, makka, soyabean, kapaas aadi kii fasal bechakar sharaab pi jate the
 Children and women did not even get to wear clothes, had to borrow and eat, then by forming a group, the women decided that those who would drink alcohol would beat them with sticks
 phir ham ghar-ghar lath lekar gayi or purushon ko samajhaayaa, jo samaj gaye unhone sharaab pinaa band kar diya jo nahin samajhe the unhen pakadakar thane le jane kii koshish kii, tab unhone jurmaana bharne va sharaab nahin pine kii baat kahi

 First the Jana Sangh and then the BJP have deep roots in this area

 At the same time, the Congress's Jujhar Singh and Shantilal Dhariwal are prominent leaders of this region

 Amazing of this trio that today Vasundhara Raje became synonymous with BJP here
 congress ne jhalawad ke chunaavon main vasundhara ke khilaaf kai prayog kiye lekin wo ab tak asafal hi sabit hue
 But according to political analysts, Hadhuti has changed a bit
 beete saal kisaan andolan kaa pramukh centre rahe is kshetra main kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii
 Because of which Sachin Pilot had thoughtfully selected Hadhuti for the Kisan Nyay Yatra
 kyonki baaraa-jhalawad saansad dushyant singh kaa kshetra he, jhalawad siem vasundhara raaje kaa nirvachan kshetra he, baaraa jila mukhyalay kaa kshetra krishi mantri prabhulaal saini kaa nirvachan kshetra he
 However, in every wave against BJP till now, Hadhuti has kept the bjp's value

 "why did Rawat have to talk about the slaughter of slaughterhouses (for the slaughter of sheep, goats, pigs and buffaloes) even though the state already has a complete prohibition order against the loss of cows?" Or is the Chief Minister willing to stop killing all animals in the state? That is, he is willing to change the food habits of the people in this state
