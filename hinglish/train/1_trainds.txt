 jaraa sochie mahaj kuch tips follow karke agar aap har maheene rasoi kharidari ke bajet main se 1000 bhi bachaa lete he to saal ke ant main aap ke paas kul 12,000 rupee bachate hai
 While shopping the kitchen, always keep a few things in mind, such as buy a large packet of the most used items, as well as buy the option of expensive items instead of buying them or refrain from buying such items
 mahaj kuch tips ko dhyaan main rakhkar aasapane banpar bachat kaa sapana sach kar sakate hai
 - Before going shopping, prepare a list of essential goods
 aataa, chaaval jaise sabase zyada istemaal hone vaale saamaan kaa bada packet or kam istemaal hone vaale saamaanon jaise daalon ke chote packet hi lijie
 - The prices of vegetables are often decreasing, just like the recently increased prices of onions have made people cry for inflation
 aise main agar aap pyaaj kaa kam istemaal karen yaa gravi vaali sabji main iskaa kam istemaal karen to bhi aap kuch bachat kar sakate hai
 Many times we buy it after seeing discounts on large packs of things like snacks, biscuits, chips and do not pay attention to our budget
 vastav main vah hamaari zarurat se kahin zyada hota he
 In such a situation, we either give it to someone after a few days or have to be thrown into compulsion
 isiilie bahut bade ke bajaay chota pack len taaki kuch samay main hi vah khatm ho jaae or unka swaad bhi barkaraar rahe
 - Loose packet of many things is very cheap
 maan lijie aapane is maheene aapane bartan dhone ke liquid sope kaa dibba liya he to agle maheene dibba lene ke bajaay uskaa saishe yaa loose packet len
 With the cost of such mandibles, more tax can also be avoided
 - expyri date dhyaan se padhakar aap kharaab saamaan yaa kuch hi samay baad expire hone vaala saamaan lene se batch sakati hai
 Also watch MRP carefully
 kai baar billing counter par pahunchakar yaa dukandaar ke bill banaate samay hamen keemat kaa pataa chalata he or kai log sankoch main keemat chukaa bhi dete hai
 But there is no harm in returning anything if it costs more

 Aaj Tak has found Honeypreet, who has become a mystery for the police of seven states
 haniprit ne ajtak ke camere par safai di he or gurmeet ram rahim ko bekasoor bataaya he
 For the first time since absconding, Honeypreet has come on Aaj Tak's camera, but the police are yet to find her
 25 agast ko gurmeet ram rahim ko doshi qaraar die jane ke baad se hi haniprit faraar thi
 After which the police of 7 states including Haryana Police are looking for him
 magar ab tak police or duusari jaanch agency haniprit ko giraftaar nahin kar pai hai
 But even after the revelations that Honeypreet has made on Aaj Tak, many questions have not been answered
 haniprit ne jo jawaab die hai, unase bhi kai sawaal khadey ho gaye hai
 1
 kisne kiya haniprit ko guide?haniprit ne bataaya ki baba ko sajaa hone ke baad wo hairaan ho gai thi
 She even went into depression
 haniprit ne bataaya, 'mujhe kanoonee prakriya kaa pataa hi nahin tha
 i became helpless after my father left
 mujhe logon ne jaisaa guide kiya maine vaise hi kiya'
 In such a situation, the question is who are those people who guided Honeypreet
 wo koun log hai, jinhone haniprit ko faraar rahane ke liye kaha? wo koun log hai jinhone haniprit ko sarender nahin karne diya? wo koun log hai, jinhone ab tak haniprit ko chhupaae rakhaa?2
 Who hatched the conspiracy? Honeypreet in her clarification also said that after Baba went to jail his brain stopped working
 haniprit ne kaha, 'aisi sthiti main main kya kisi ke khilaaf sajeesh rach paati?darasal, haniprit se sawaal kiya gaya tha ki us par villen hone ke aarope lag rahe hai
 To which he gave this answer
 magar, phir ye sawaal uthta he ki agar haniprit ne baba kii kaali karatuuton main villen kaa role nahin nibhaayaa to phir wo koun log hai jo gurmeet ke gurgey hai or uske samrajya se kaale dhandhe karte hai?3
 Why did Honeypreet not speak on Vishwas Gupta? Honeypreet's husband Vishwas Gupta also came in front of the media and made very serious allegations on her
 vishwaas ne daawa kiya tha ki baba or haniprit ke bich shaareerik sambandh the
 When Faith Gupta was questioned by Honeypreet, she said, 'I don't want to talk about Vishwas Gupta's issue'
 aise main bada sawaal ye he ki jis vishwaas gupta ne haniprit par saream gambhir aarope lagaae, us par haniprit ne kyon kuch nahin bolaa?4
 Who made the heroine? Honeypreet has also worked with Baba in the film
 ise lekar bhi ajtak ne haniprit se sawaal kiya
 When Honeypreet was asked if Ram Rahim brought her to the movies, Honeypreet denied it
 haniprit ne kaha, 'main heroin nahin bananaa chaahati thi
 i always said that i wanted to be behind the camera '
 jiske baad ye sawaal uth rahaa he ki agar baba ne haniprit ko heroin nahin banaaya to phir wo kaise filmon main ain?5
 Who brought Delhi? Honeypreet, who is unable to find the police of seven states, has revealed to come to the capital Delhi
 isse pehle dilli hai court main haniprit kii agrim jamaanat yachika daayar karne vaale vakil ne uske dilli aane kii baat bataai thi
 In such a situation, the question is also, who are those people who have come to Delhi with Honeypreet and no one has any inkling? On the issue of not being able to catch Honeypreet now, the ruling BJP of Haryana has also clarified
 
 haryana bijepi ke pravaktaa jawahar yadav ne kaha he ki sarkaar yaa bijepi ne gurmeet ram rahim or haniprit ke rishton par kabhi sawaal nahin uthaae hai
 He also said that Haryana Police has arrested 1850 people in this case
 aise main police par sawaal uthaanaa galata he
 It has been almost a year since Bollywood actress Sridevi left this world
 haalanki phans ke liye is baat ko sweekaar kar paanaa aaj bhi mushkil he ki cinema jagat kii diggaj adaakara shridevi ab is duniya main nahin raheen
 She was to work in the film Kalank, directed by Abhishek Varman, but after her departure from this world, the director had to cast someone else for her role
 abhishek ne bahut soch-vichaar ke baad is role ke liye maadhuri dikshit ko cast kiya
 During the promotion of Total Dhamaal, 51-year-old Madhuri told how difficult it was to accept that Sridevi was no more
 unhone kaha, "is baat ko sweekaar karne main bahut vakt laga ki vah nahin raheen
 It was very shocking
 meraa riection aisa tha ki aap chaahate hai ki main yah role karun? kyonki ve bhi bahut majaboor the
 They had to keep working
 "unhone kaha, "ek insaan ke daur par ise sweekaar karnaa mushkil tha
 As an artist, you know the role and the script
 ye donon puri tarah se alag chijen hai
 But it was very difficult to accept the truth
 " bataa den ki shridevi ke nidhan ke baad unki beti jahnavi kapur ne maadhuri ke saath apni maa kii ek tasviir soshal media par post kii thi

 a post shared byjanhvi Kapoor(@janhvikapoor) onmar 19, 2018 at 1:12am pdtview this post on Instagram # Dhadak # dhadkatha post shared byjanhvi Kapoor(@janhvikapoor) onnov 15, 2017 at 3:53am PST It was believed that the Mahagathbandhan (jharkhand Assembly Election 2019) will contest the Mahagathbandhan (BJP) NDA and Raghubar Das
 bhaajapa (BJP) kaaryakartaaon ne 'ghar-ghar raghubar' or 'abaki baar pansth paar' kaa ati utsaahi naaraa bhi diya tha
 But it seems that after the rebellion of Saryu Rai, the political leader of Jharkhand, especially the BJP, and the All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU) openly defied the BJP in fighting its own rather than Mahagathbandhan Has become beautiful yah ladaai itani talkh he ki baagi ho chuke sarayu raay (saryu Rai) ne jharkhand ke mukhyamantri raghubar das (raghubar Das), jinaki cabinet main vah khud ravivaar tak khaadya or aapurti mantri the, ke khilaaf jamshedpur purvi seat se parchaa daakhil kar diya he
 Now the fight has become straightforward
 raghubar das bhi (raghubar Das) jamshedpur purvi seat se hi ladate hai
 Actually, Saryu Rai was not given a ticket in this election
 tab shanivaar ko jamshedpur main raay ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan main gusse main kaha tha, ‘party netritv se seat kii bheekh maangana mere liye upyukt nahin he
 So i have asked them not to consider my name
 ’ravivaar ko hi raay ne vidhayak pad ke saath-saath mantripad se bhi tyaagptr de diya
 But it is important to note that Rai has not resigned from BJP membership
 mahagathbandhan (mahagathbandhan) ne is maukey ko fouran lapka, par raay kaa samarthan karne se hichak gaya
 Former Chief Minister and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) leader Hemant Soren welcomed Saryu Rai's move and said in Ranchi that he is standing with Saryu Rai in the fight against corruption
 unke is bayaan ke kuch hi ghante baad congress party ne jamshedpur purv seat se apane charchit pravaktaa gaurav vallabh ko party kaa pratyaashee banaae jane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 But how dangerous can Saryu Rai be for Raghubar Das? What is the importance of Saryu Rai in the politics of Jharkhand? The answer is: many
 bihar-jharkhand main hue chaara ghotaale ko janata ke saamne laakar uski adalati jaanch ko anjaam tak pahunchane main sarayu raay (saryu Rai) kii kaaphi mahatvapurn bhoomika rahi he
 Saryu Rai played an active role in sending the former Jharkhand Chief Minister Madhu Koda to jail
 jharkhand main unki pratishtha isse kaaphi bad gai
 Raghubar Das contested the first election from Jamshedpur East seat in 1995
 tab bhaajapa ne apane nivartmaan vidhayak deenanath pandeya kaa tikat katkar unhen chunaav ladaaya tha
 Pandey contested the election independently with the support of the Shiv Sena and Raghubar Das had barely won the election
 par uske baad se raghubar das (raghubar Das) lagaataar is seat par jeet hasil karte rahe
 He became the Deputy Chief Minister of Jharkhand for the first time in 2009 and Chief Minister in 2014
 2014 main pichhlaa vidhansabha chunaav unhone 70,000 se bhi adhik voton ke antar se jeeta tha
 Then 61 to BJP here
 5 fisad vot mili the
 Congress 19 then
 8 fisad vot lekar duusare sthaan par rahi thi
 As BJP candidate, Das had 1,03,427 votes
 ab is tikhi or talkh ladaai ke nijee rup dharne ke baad se jharkhand vidhansabha chunaav (jharkhand Assembly election 2019) kaaphi dilachasp ho gaya he
 After all, Raghubar Das's political career will only progress, but will shine only if he defeats Saryu Rai
 agar das chunaav haar jate hai to unki siyaasi pari par viraam lagane kaa khatra mandaraayega

 Entertainment @rohitshettypicturez @dharmamovies # capeofgoodfilmsa post shared byakshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) onnov 30, 2019 at 4:01 am PST Not only Akshay but the film's director Rohit Shetty also shared a picture - Akshay Kumar wrote the film Suryavanshi today Shot ye mujhe 9 saal peeche lekar jaataa he jab saal 2010 main golmaal 3 bada hit sabit hui thi
 At the same time, i told Ajay Devgan that i am going to make an action film on the coop
 maine uske baad singhm banaai thi
 View this post on instagramas Akshay Kumar gave his last shot today for our Cop Universe 'sooryavanshi', it takes me back to 9 years ago in 2010 when Golmaal 3 became a massive hit
 That day i had mentioned to Ajay Devgn that i was looking forward to making an action film on cops and eventually we made Singham
 i never imagined that Singham's journey would ultimately weave in such magnificent characters like the notorious Ranveer Singh as Simmba and now the Dynamic Akshay Kumar as Sooryavanshi, becoming the country's first cinematic Cop Universe
 And today 9 years later when i wrap my last shot with Akshay playing Sooryavanshi it magically coincides with the day we announce our next venture - Golmaal FIVE
 AB ISSE LOGIC KAHO YA MAGIC, i don't know
 
 
 All i can say is that DESTINY HAS a PLAN FOR EVERYONE SO, ZYAADA SOCHO MAT BAS KAAM KARTE JAAO! ❤️ @akshaykumar @ajaydevgn @ranveersingh @katrinakaif @karanjohar @rohitshettypicturez @reliance
 entertainment @dharmamovies # capeofgoodfilms # sooryavanshi # golmaalfivea post shared byrohit Shetty (@itsrohitshetty) onnov 30, 2019 at 4:33 am PST At that time i had not even guessed that Ranveer Singh as Simba in this journey with Singham And characters like Akshay Kumar will come out as Suryavanshi and it will become the first cinematic coop of the country
 ab akshay ke saath is film kii shooting khatm karne ke baad maine unase kaha ki ve golmaal 5 banane ke bare main soch rahe hai
 Now call it logic or magic
 mujhe nahin pataa
 Just know that Destiny has a plan for everyone, so don't think too much, just keep working

 It is being said that Delhi Police will show the High Court before presenting the charge sheet, so that there is no screw in the way of getting the biggest punishment

 It was Jaipur's turn in the seven-match series on Wednesday
 jaipur main bharat ke sheron ne aisa karnama kiya ki australian captain jorge baili ko kahana padaa- 'samaj nahin paa rahaa hum ki is samay main kya mahasoos karun'
 Like Pune, in Australia, Australia won the toss
 pehle ballebaaji kaa faisla kiya
 The verdict proved to be largely true
 pehle paanch ballebaajon ne pachaase jamaaye or 50 over main 5 wicket khokar 359 kaa pahaad-sa score bharat ke saamne khadaa kar diya
 The Indian bowlers were once again unsuccessful
 bhubaneshwar kumaar ko chhodkar kisi bhi gendbaaj kaa iconomi rate 6 se neeche nahin rahaa
 At this time, Indian fans were blown away by the wind

 Rohit Sharma turned Australia's mountain into a bloom before the 44th over was completed with 141 off 123 balls (not out) and Virat's complete 100 (not out) off 52 balls
 maidan main chaaron taraf jashn kaa maahaul tha or bhartiya khiladiyon ke chehron par rangath laut ai thi
 Obviously, it will boost the Indian Lions for big and historic next matches
 australia ne 6 gendbaajon kaa istemaal kiya
 None of these bowlers had an economy rate below 7

 George Bailey, who was commanding Australia for the first time, later said- 'can't understand what to feel
 bhartiya ballebaajon ne ant main to kamaal hi kar diya
 We had seen all our weapons, but all were going in vain
 'yadi aapako dhyaan ho to pune ke match main australian gendbaajon ne choti genden daalkar bhartiya ballebaajon ko pareshaan kiya tha
 But in Jaipur small balls were also seen outside the boundary line
 shikhar dhawan ne kaha, 'hamane pehle sanbhalkar shuruyaat kii
 Played big shots when they lasted
 rohit sharma ne bahut achche khel kaa pradarshan kiya
 i am very happy 'maine kai stoopid shot khele: rohit sharmarohit sharma ne kaha- 'maanata hum ki maine kai stoopid shot khele, lekin aise shots khelnaa match kii jarurat thi
 After Rohit Sharma was elected 'match of the Match', he said that he was in great need of this long innings
 ve 50 over tak krij par tike rahanaa chaahate the
 Don't look at the target, just keep playing: Dhoni: Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said that he had told the batsmen, 'don't see the target, just go on playing

 However, on the second day Hemraj's corpse was recovered from the roof of Rajesh Talwar's house
 police kii deree se yahaan se saboot nahin mil paae
 So was there a flaw in the police investigation or was the killer so clever that between 12 and 6 o'clock he ended every rule of murder

 It also says that the three of them did not even talk to Hemraj that night

 Upon investigation, the investigation was started very closely
 kyonki kamare main naa to jabaran ghusane kii koshish hui thi or naa hi marane waalon ke saath koi jor jabardastee ke nishaan the
 Generally, this family also had the same things as a family
 bas un 2 chizon ko chhodkar
 Who took the life of the four was what those two things were
 jo police or forensik kii team ko hairaan kar rahi thim
 What was the thing that killed these four? After all what happened in room number 211 within those 30 hours? Why was the color of each corpse changed to blue? Usually, there is no example of such death when a person lying on the bed is dying and there is not even a wrinkle on the bed
 kamare main maujuud the 2 alag samanroom number 211 main mili do chizon ne police or forensik team ko hairaan kar diya
 She was a small weighing machine and a chemical box named sodium nitrate next to it
 sawaal ye tha ki aakhir is lagzri rezart main picnic manaane apane parivaar ke saath nikle abhishek saxena ke room main is chemical kaa kya kaam tha
 Did any such person enter the room
 jisane dhokhe se is parivaar ko ye jaanaleva chemical de diya or phir badi khamoshi se rum se baahar bhi nikal gaya
 The admission of someone else in a sodium nitrate cream drank with water is also rejected because the tea cups have been found by chance
 unamem chaay nahin balki pani ke saath usee sodium nitrate chemical ko milaayaa gaya tha
 In the room too, the way all the things are kept in order, she was indicating that this matter is of mass suicide
 sabane pi liya maut kaa jamdarasal, marane waalon ko pataa tha ki wo jo pine ja rahe hai, uske baad wo bachenge nahin
 But still everyone caught the chemical
 thik vaise hi jaise dilli ke buraadi main 11 logon ne samuhik khudakushi kii thi
 It is possible that like Burari, here too the head of the family has convinced everyone to commit suicide
 magar hairaan karne vaali baat ye he ki aakhir usne aisa kya kaha hoga ki sabane khushi khushi maut kaa wo jam pi liya
 Police admitted that seeing the condition of suicide case, the police accepted that the matter was of suicide
 or ab wo khudakushi kii vajah ko talashne main jute gai
 But why this collective suicide
 ye bada sawaal tha
 The answer to which was to be searched
 kyonki marane se pehle jin logon se abhishek yaa priti ne baat kii
 Their conversation did not seem like they were going to take such a big step
 kyon kii samuhik aatmahatyapulice ne jab tafsheesh shuru kii to pataa chalaa ki abhishek saxena indore kii ek privet company main anbhavi software ejeeniyar the
 His wife also used to work
 bachche achche skool main padhate the
 Moreover, the family lived in a expensive apartment in Indore
 to phir is parivaar ke saath aakhir aisa kya hua jisane unhen moss suicide ke liye majaboor kar diya
 There was no suicide note in the husband-wife room
 taaki ye saaf ho sake ki agar is parivaar ne khudakushi kii to kyon kii
 But when the police started collecting information about Abhishek and his family, it was found that the software company in which Abhishek was on senior post
 wo company hi khatm ho gai
 In this way, Abhishek, who has been earning a salary of millions every month, got his first blow
 vahiin unki patni priti bhi jis privet company main karti thi
 He had also lost his job from there
 aarthik badahaali kaa shikaar tha parivarato abhishek or unke parivaar kii aamadani achaanak khatm ho gai thi
 But the expenses remained the same
 us par share trading main bhi abhishek lakhon rupee ganvaa chukaa tha
 At the same time, both his children were continuously sick
 unke ilaaj ke liye bhi paisa chahie tha
 Overall the family was going through a financial crisis
 magar shame kii vajah se unhone kabhi apane karibiyon se paise nahin maange
 Abhishek used to spend his life on children
 Those who know Abhishek know that he used to spend his life on his children
 wo unhen hameshaa apane saath rakhte the
 So why did Abhishek join him in this madness
 ye bada sawaal he
 However, the family members say that it is possible that Abhishek had thought that the children would not be able to live without him, so he gave his children a drink of this death
 sibar team ne khole gagetfilhal police kii sibar team is samuhik khudakushi kii vajah jaanane ke liye abhishek or priti ke mobile phone or unke email idi vagahara kii jaanch kar rahi he, taaki iskaa pataa lagaaya ja sake
 However, all the electronic gadgets of Abhishek that the police have got were password protected
 magar police ne unhen kholkar khudakushi kii asli vajah pataa kar lee he
 Searching the Internet, the stuff of death, when police searched Abhishek's laptop, it was found that Abhishek had searched a chemical called sodium nitrate on the internet a few days earlier
 yani usne pehle hi tay kar liya tha ki khudakushi kis tarah kerani he
 According to the police, this chemical was the first to mix both children in water
 iske baad bivi ko pilaayaa or phir aakhir main khud bhi pi gaya
 Broken Mountains on Elderly Parents The pain of the 82-year-old father's pain came out of his eyes when the body of his only son was brought before him
 phir unhone ek-ek kar jab bahu or pote-potee kii laash dekhi to kalejaa fat gaya
 In front of the post mortem house, that mother could not believe her eyes that their world was destroyed in a moment
 us boodhi maa ko maa kehane vaale

 Have you interacted with Bollywood friends in the last few years? i was not in touch with anyone
 kuch saal pehle meri manisha koirala se mulaakaat hui or anupam kher sahab bhi jab south aate hai to unase milanaa hota he
 Nobody can meet anyone else

 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi is working hard to make Swami Vivekananda his symbol for the December assembly elections
 iske madhyam se unhen apni pahunch badhaane ke saath hi aresas kii kattarpanthi line se jude rahane main bhi madad milegi
 The itinerary carrying them to 150 assembly constituencies out of the 182 assembly constituencies of Gujarat was flagged off on 11 September
 1893 main 11 sitambar ko hi vivekanand ne chicago kii vishwa dharm sansad main apana prasiddh bhaashan diya tha
 His vehicle is named Swami Vivekananda Yuva Vichar Vikas Yatra Rath
 sarkaar ne swami vivekanand ke naam se kai loklubhaavan yojanaon kii ghoshnaa kii he
 It also includes the grant of 35,000 cricket kits and volleyball to each of the 13,000 panchayats and urban wards, at which Rs 12 crore
 kii laagat aegi
 Vivekananda Yuva Mandal is being formed in all 13,000 villages
 sabhi pramukh sarkari pustakaalayon main ek vivekanand corner or sabhi municipal udyanon main vivekanand swasthya centre gymnasium hoga
 About 4,00,000 youths will be trained in skillful works under the Vivekananda Skill Development Scheme
 or yah sab kuch vivekanand ke janm ke 150wein varsh main hoga
 The RSS has been trying to claim Swami Vivekananda's legacy for a long time

 varisht bijepi netaa laalkrishna adwani bhi karachi main 1942 se 1946 ke bich ramakrishna mishan main unke vichaaron se prabhavit hue the
 By distributing cricket kit and volleyball featuring Vivekananda's photographs and Modi's two election slogans 'ramshe Gujarat, Jeetashe Gujarat' (khele Gujarat, Jeet Gujarat) and 'khele Gujarat, Khile Gujarat', the Chief Minister tried to connect Vivekananda's sports love with Gujarati pride
 Has kalavid jyotindra jain kaa maananaa he ki modi vivekanand kii purnsthapana karnaa chaahate hai or yah baat unke rojaanaa ke twit main bhi dikhti he
 In this way Modi is hoping to make a pan-india presence
 jain kehete hai, ''swami vivekanand karmkandi nahin the
 He was secular and was well liked in the West, especially in America
 is par bhi ve ek garvile hindu the
 Modi would like a similar image for himself
 ''yah nishchit rup se pradhanmantri pad kii unki mahatvakanksha kaa bhi poshan karata he
 Unlike the controversial Swaminarayan sect, Vivekananda's legacy is untouched by fundamentalism or ritualism
 unke upadesh bhi vyaavhaarik hai
 As Modi said in his speech at the beginning of the yatra, "swami believed in a strong and strong India
" ''jeenyu ke itihaaskaar aditya mukherjee kaa maananaa he ki ramakrishna mishan ko, jisaki sthapana vivekanand ne apane guru ramakrishna paramhans kii prerana se kii thi, is kadam kaa usee tarah jabardast virodh karnaa chahie jis tarah vidhivetta divangat nani palakhivaala ne 1992 main vallabhbhai patel ko ek kattarpanthi ke rup main chitrit karne ke bijepi ke prayaas kaa virodh kiya tha, ''grih mantri ke rup main vallabhbhai patel ne aresas par pratibandh lagane kaa saahas dikhaaya tha
 This shows how secular and non-sectarian they were in their outlook
 ''mukherjee kehete hai, ''bijepi itihaas ko phir se likhane kii koshish kar rahi he lekin uske paas vyapak pasand vaala koi pratik nahin he or uske paas pratikon ko udhaar lene ke alaava koi chaara nahin he
 It is the responsibility of the secular forces of India to stop this use of symbols
 ''bijepi netaa parendu bhagat mukhyamantri kaa bachaav karte hue kehete hai, ''modi ke liye swami ji koi rajnatik upkaran nahin hai
 Since childhood, he has been taking inspiration from Vivekananda
 ''kehane kii jarurat nahin ki unhen ummid hogi ki mukhyamantri kii yatra 25 aktubar ko samaapt hone tak vivekanand ke naam se utpann hone vaale kuch sakaaratmak pratik unki chhavi chamakaa chuke honge
 Since January, Gujarat has been celebrating the 150th year of the birth of Swami Vivekananda as Yuva Shakti
 modi ke anusaar, chicago sammelan main bhaag lene ke liye vivekanand ko limbody ke raja sahit teen gujaratiyon ne 1891 main pradesh kii unki yatra ke dauraan prerit kiya tha

 After the nationwide outcry over petrol prices soaring, there is a possibility of applying ointment to the wounds of the common man
 petrol kii keemton main 2 rupee prati litre kii kami ho sakati he
 Oil companies are going to review oil prices on 31 May
 agar kachche tel kii antarrashtriya keemat main badhotaree nahin hoti he, to petrol kii keemat kam ho sakati he
 That is, the price reduction depends on the stability of crude oil price in the international market
 samachar agency royatres ke mutabik, petrol ke daamon main 2 rupee kii kami kii ghoshnaa ho sakati he
 According to the agency, the chairman of Bharat Petroleum has said the price reduction
 gauratlab he ki petrol kii keemat main achaanak kareeb saadhe 7 rupee kii badhotaree ke khilaaf aam janata kaa aakrosh ubaal par he
 Political parties along with the public are also trying to cash in on this issue
 31 may ko kai partiyon ne deshvyapee band kaa bhi elaan kiya he
 Choosing death by will is not easy
 petrol chhidakar khud ko aag ke hawaale kar dena aasaan nahin
 But a man named Premji Jitiya of Ahmedabad was so upset by the policeman's health that he found the path of death much easier
 maut kii vajah aapane khud maranevaale kii jubaani sunali
 But the question arises why Pankaj, the constable of Vejalpur police station, Ahmedabad, was harassing Premji Jitiya
 kyon usne ek aam insaan ko khudakushi kaa rasta chunane par majaboor kar diya? ye vajah sunakar bhi aap hairaan ho jaaenge
 Actually, a girl working on Premji Jitiya's site ran away with a boy
 maamle kii chaanbin ke karanevaale kantable pankaj ko lagane laga ki sachai kaa pataa lagane kii jimmedaari police kii nahin balki premaji jitiya kii hi he or wo premaji ke saath jyaadati karne laga
 Repeatedly call the police station, threatening to be seen and abused
 jab bardaasht na hua to premaji jitiya ne maut ko gale lagaana hi behatar samajha
 Nothing can be more proof than the statement given before the death, but the stain has fallen on itself
 khudakushi ke liye majaboor karne kaa iljaam apane mahakme ke mulajim par he to ahmedabad police ko maamle main giraftaar yaa karrwai kii koi jaldbaaji nahin
 Don't you be surprised? On the complaint of the boy running away, the police made Premji Jitiya's life difficult, but now that Premji Jitiya has died, the police are not in a hurry to investigate even if they are arrested

 Experts believe that the ongoing trade war between the US and China will help increase export opportunities for India in both countries
 bharat donon deshon main paridhaan, krishi, vaahan or mashinari ke kshetra main niryaat avasar hasil kar saktaa he
 Professor Rakesh Mohan Joshi at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) said that the US is mainly targeting intermediate equipment from China, especially in the machinery and electronics sector, while on the other hand China has shifted agricultural products from the US including automotive and soybeans

 According to the news agency PTI, Professor Rakesh Mohan Joshi said that there is a huge potential for India in these areas

 He said that India should take advantage of this opportunity
 bharat ko vishesh taur par soochna or sanchaar praudyogiki (ICT) ke kshetra main apana niryaat badhanaa chahie

 There are two sensations - the first feeling is the face, the stains are very dark, the hats, the tilism, i do not sing with fear from the truth, i do not sing such a sight, i am not able to meet in the fair of my own city
 i do not sing the song again and again - the second feeling is the new song, i am born with broken wires, the bassist has risen in the chest of the voice Seeing the line of Arunim in the new sprout, all yellow, cuckoo's kuhuk night, i know who will listen to the broken dreams, i will not listen to the sorrow of the broken dreams, i will not accept the rage on the eyelids; doodh main daraar pad gaikhun kyon safed ho gaya?bhed main abhed kho gaya
 The martyrs were divided, the songs were cut, there was a dagger in the heart
 doodh main daraar pad gai
 The smell of landmines in the fields, broken Nanak's verses have risen, is a disturbed bit
 vasant se bahaar jhad gaidoodh main daraar pad gai
 Hatred with your own shadow, hugs are beginning to be out of the way, the path of self-destruction, you are concerned about the country
 baat banaaen, bighad gai
 The milk turned sour

 philhal desh main prati 10 lakh kii aabaadi par 13 jajon ke anupaat ko sudhaarney ke liye jajon kii bhartee kii bahuaiami yojana banaai jaae
 More courts should be created and facilities in existing courts should be increased

 Adequate review should be in place at the time of approval

 Make the law, do not raise fights, the government only sues most

 When the matter is not resolved there should only come in the courts
 meri raay he ki sarkaar ko pehali adaalat kaa faisla hi sweekaar kar lenaa chahie, na ki upree adaalaton main apil kii jaani chahie
 Also, government lawyers should help the courts in early hearing of the case
 unhen yah yaad rakhana chahie ki ve sirf sarkaar ke vakil nahin, balki adaalat ke kanoonee adhikari bhi hai
 Do not interfere in the work of others
 Adults should not normally get involved in administrative matters
 saath hi saath, jahaan kanoon kii avhelnaa hoti lage, adaalaton ko hastkshep se parhez nahin karnaa chahie
 It should always be kept in mind that the judiciary cannot take the responsibility of the executive on itself
 paardarshee adalati vyavastha kii darkaranyayik niyuktiyon ke maamle main saathi jajon or baar council ke sadasyon se vyapak vichaar-vimarsh hona chahie
 The role of the judiciary is limited to making suggestions, the President appoints

 In my opinion, the collegium system itself is better, provided better scrutiny is done in the selection of candidates

 Nusrat Jahan Karva Chauth: Actress-turned-politician Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Nusrat Jahan (nusrat Jahan) observed Karva Chauth's fast for the first time after marriage
 29 varshiya saansad ne pati nikhil jain (nikhil Jain) ke saath karvaa chouth celibrasion kii tasviren apni instagram story par share kii hai
 Nusrat married in June this year with businessman Nikhil Jain
 aapako bataa den ki guuruuvaar ko desh bhar main karvaa chouth manaaya gaya
 From politicians and celebrities to common people, this fast has been observed by the entire law
 manyata he ki karvaa chouth kaa vrath rakhane se pati kii umr lambii hoti he
 Not only this, virgin girls also keep this fast
 kehete hai ki is vrath ke prabhaav se manavaanchit jivan saathi miltaa he
 On the occasion of Karva Chauth, Nusrat Jahan wore a ruddy red color sari and had sixteen adornments
 tasviir dekhakar aap andaja laga sakate hai ki nusrat ne puure paaramparik vidhi-vidhaan ke saath karvaa chouth kii har rasm ko nibhaayaa
 Nusrat Jahan performed his fast after drinking water in the hands of husband Nikhil Jain after offering the moon
 tasviir dekhakar lag rahaa he ki nusrat ke pati ne bhi unke liye vrath rakhaa tha
 While Nusrat was seen in a red colored sari, Nikhil Jain was wearing a blue kurta
 gauratlab he ki nusrat jahaan jab se saansad baniin hai tab se vah kattarpathiyon ke nishane par hai
 When he was sworn in Parliament House for the first time after becoming an MP, he touched Speer's feet
 us dauraan vah kisi hindu nav-vivaahit mahila kii tarah saji-dhaji thim
 But the fundamentalists did not like to touch their feet and fill the demand and wear Mangalsutra

 " Australia and India will face each other in the second semi-final of ICC Cricket World
 sidney cricket ground main 26 march ko khele jane vaale is match main jabardast romaanch dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 India has been in Australia since late November last year
 donon timen ab tak test or vanade siries main ek-duusare se bhid chuki hai
 After such a long tour both teams are fully aware of each other
 harek khilaadi ke paas virdohi team puraa khaakaa chittha he
 That is, India too must have devised a strategy against Australia
 par semifinal jaise ahm mukaable main ek bhi galati vishwa cap se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa degi
 In such a situation, India has to take special care of these five things
 in 5 vajahon se ham honge kangaaroon par baarikangaroon kii tej gendbaaji kaa 'woolf pack'australian khilaadiyon ko bhale hi kangaaroon ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa ho, par is team ke tej gendbaaj 'woolf pack' kii tarah he
 In cricket terms, these bowlers hunt opposing batsmen like a 'wolf Pack'
 chautarafa akraman
 If Mitchell Starc survived these swinging bowling, be prepared for Mitchell Johnson's pace and bouncer
 agar in donon se paar paa liya to joush hejalwould kii sateek line-length gendbaaji yaa pat kamins kii raftaar bhari gendbaaji
 Suppose you took a bite of these four bowlers, now what will you do on the clever bowling of James Faulkner
 sabase ahm baat yah he ki ye sabhi gendbaaj kareeb 150 kilometre prati ghanta kii raftaar se ball phenk sakate hai
 That is, you will get caught in some kind of trap
 world cap semifinal: log chhuttiyaan lene ke liye bahaane bana rahe hangem ranon or viketon kaa he, sledging kaa nahinaustralian cricketer mind game main maahir hai
 None of them in the case of sledging
 match to abhi shuru bhi nahin hua par zyaadaatar australian cricketer sledging par bad-chadhakar bayaanbaji kar rahe hai
 Looking at the current team India, it is also decided that they will answer the sledging only by sledging
 yani maidan par jabardast tanatani dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 And the Kangaroo also wants the same
 unhen lagata he ki yah ranneeti unke andar kaa sarvshereshth nikaalati he
 Therefore, Indian cricketers have to avoid getting caught in this trap
 kyonki yah match gend or balle kaa he, sledging kaa nahin
 Who sled when? Was he answered? This type of thinking can divert the attention of the players away from cricket, which is very harmful in important matches like semi-finals
 bharat ko agar australia ke sledging kaa jawaab dena he to balle or gend se de, tabhi nateeja apane paksh main jayega
 The 'googly' of the pitch has created a lot of panic about the pitch of Sidney
 kangaroo chaahate hai ki pich unke tej gendbaajon ke liye madadgaar ho
 But it is clear from the curator's statement that this is very unlikely
 jaankaar bataate hai ki yah pich dhimi hogi or is par spin ko phayda mil saktaa he
 But this can also prove to be a smokescreen
 kyonki is maidan par khele gaye quarterfinal mukaable main bhale hi south africa ke spin gendbaajon ne srilanka ke khilaaf 7 wicket jatke
 But it is also true that South Africa scored over 400 runs against the West Indies at this ground
 or mejabaan team or srilanka ke bich hue mukaable main donon tiimon ne 300 se zyada ran banaae the
 If the pitch that helps Team India spin is hopeful then it can prove fatal for them
 iske alaava mangalvaar ko puure din sidney main barish hui jis vajah se pich par cover laga rahaa
 That is, there is not as much sunlight on this pitch that Team India would have expected
 'spinner' maxwell par soch samaj kar khelenzyaadaatar cricket export kaa maananaa he ki spin department main bharat kaa palada baari he
 Whether it is about spin bowlers or playing spin bowling
 cricket export maanakar chal rahe hai ki donon hi paristhiti main bharat australia par haaavee rahegaa
 Well, it is believed that Australia will not change their playing eleven and Glenn Maxwell will be seen as a part time spinner
 bharat ke liye maxwell ko khelnaa zyada mushkil nahin hoga
 But this is a tricky case
 maxwell of spinner hai
 Everyone is aware of Team India's recent performance in front of off-spin bowling
 england daure par jis tarah se part timer moin ali ne hamaare ballebaajon kii pole kholi
 Remembering him, fear will remain in his mind
 ajinkya rahane or shikhar dhawan aksar moin ali kaa shikaar bane
 Cricket experts believe that India took Moin Ali lightly
 duusare chor par acchhee gendbaaji ke dabaav se ubarne ke liye bharat ke moin par zyada akraman kiya natijatan ve apana wicket phenkate gaye
 Something similar can also happen in a semi-final match
 agar team india ehtiyaat nahin baratati he to semifinal main bhi maxwell kii phiraki bharat par baari sabit ho sakati he
 Bouncer's greed has impressed everyone with the Indian fast bowlers' strategy in the World Cup
 ve apni raftaar se virdohi ballebaaj par haaavee hone main safal rahe hai, khaskar bounsar ke istemaal se zyaadaatar export chakit hai
 Records show that in this World Cup, India has taken around 25 wickets with short balls
 isamen melbern cricket ground kii lambii boundry or perth kii bounsi pich kaa bhi ahm yogadan rahaa
 But neither the boundary is so long in the SCG nor the Perth bounce in the pitch here
 iske alaava quarter final mukaable main pakistan ne jis tarah se bounsar daalkar australian ballebaajon ko pareshaan kiya wo bharat ko bounsar ranneeti apnaane ke liye pralobhit kar saktaa he
 But Team India should not forget that Kangaroo is accustomed to playing bouncy wickets at home
 australia ke khilaaf test siries ko bhi yaad kiya jaae to bisben test to ham apni bounsar ranneeti ke kaaran haare
 Mitchell Johnson adopted the strategy of putting a bouncer and looted runs instead
 bounsar markar ballebaaj ko parakhane main kuch bhi galat nahin he par is ranneeti par bahut zyada nirbhar hona bharat ke liye mushkilen khadaa kar saktaa he
 The final and deciding ODI of the current ODI series between India and South Africa will be played at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai
 yah maidan team india or dhoni ke liye lucky rahaa he
 This is the same ground where Team India, under Dhoni's captaincy, showed the charisma of winning the World Cup after 28 years
 bharat ne is maidan main ab tak 16 match khele hai, isamen team 10 match jeetne main kaamyaab rahi he
 Team India has played 3 matches in this ground against South Africa and India has won all the three matches
 is lihaaj se dekhen to aankade dhoni ke paksh main hai
 The pitch is expected to help the spinners more, but the fast bowlers will also benefit in the early overs
 is lihaaj se toss kii bhoomika bhi ahm hogi, haalanki is maidan par pehle or baad main ballebaazi karne vaali team ke liye barabari kaa mauka hoga
 So far, 19 matches have been played on this ground, the team batting first in 10 wins, and the team playing in 9 wins
 yani is muqaabale main pehle khilne vaali team kii tulana main baad main khilne vaali team bhi jeet kii utani hi daavedaar hogi
 By the way, if Team India wins this match then after four years, they will win the ODI series from South Africa
 tippaniyan However, for ODI captain MS Dhoni, the match played at the Wankhede Stadium will be very important
 isi siries main dhoni ye dekh chuke hai ek haar ke baad unki captaini par sawaal uth rahe hai
 Questions have also been asked on his place in the team, although Dhoni has responded well to this, but after losing the ODI series, he would not like to give critics any chance again
 aise main dhoni is muqaabale ke liye apni har tarkeeb apnaanaa chahenge vahiin duusari ore abi divilliars kii captaini main mehmaan team test series se pehle apana manobal badhanaa chaahegi, lihaaja darshakon ko ek romaanchak muqaabala dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 India has played 16 matches so far in this ground, in which the team has managed to win 10 matches
 dakshin africa ke khilaaf is maidan main team india ne 3 match khele hai or teenon match bharat ne jite hai
 From this perspective, the figures are in favor of Dhoni
 pich se spinneron ko zyaada madad milane kii ummid he, lekin shuruaati overon main tej gendbaazon ko bhi phayda milegaa
 In this context, the role of the toss will also be important, although there will be a chance for the team to bat before and after this field
 is maidan par ab tak 19 match khele gaye hai, 10 main pehle ballebaazi karne vaali team ko jeet mili he to 9 main baad main khilne vaali team jiti he
 That is, in this case, the team playing later than the team playing earlier will be equally likely to win
 vaise team india agar ye muqaabala jeet leti he to chaar saal ke baad dakshin africa se vanade series jeetegi
 The comments vaise vanade captain emes dhoni ke liye vankhede stadium main khelaa jane vaala muqaabala behad ahm hoga
 In this series, Dhoni has seen that after a defeat, his captaincy is being questioned
 team main unki jagah par bhi sawaal puche jane lage hai haalanki dhoni ne iskaa bakhubi jabaav de diya he, lekin vanade series harkar ve ek baar phir aalochakon ko koi mauka nahin dena chahenge
 In such a situation, Dhoni would like to adopt all his tricks for this match, on the other hand, under the captaincy of AB de Villiers, the visiting team would like to boost their morale before the Test series, so the audience can get to see an exciting match
 is lihaaj se dekhen to aankade dhoni ke paksh main hai
 The pitch is expected to help the spinners more, but the fast bowlers will also benefit in the early overs
 is lihaaj se toss kii bhoomika bhi ahm hogi, haalanki is maidan par pehle or baad main ballebaazi karne vaali team ke liye barabari kaa mauka hoga
 So far, 19 matches have been played on this ground, the team batting first in 10 wins, and the team playing in 9 wins

 bihar kii siyasat vaise to har kadam apane rang badalati he, magar saal 2018 anya saalon kii apeksha thodaa alag rahaa
 Not only did political politics appear in the politics here, but family feuds also came to light
 darasal, bihar main saal 2018 raajnneetik uthaak-patake ke rup main yaad kiya jayega
 The new political equation which began to deteriorate from the beginning of 2018, continued till the end of the year, due to which many old political friends became enemies, while many political enemies were seen to be Galbia
 aise main gujarey varsh ke siyaasi samikarnon ne desh main bhi surkhiyaan baniin
 This year will not only be remembered for the vicissitudes of political equations, but also as an exercise in the family relations and breakdown of political friendship in this one year

 jithan ram maanjhi ne bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se naaraazgi ke baad khud apni party hindustani avam morcha bana lee thi or rajg ke saath ho liye the
 By the way, if we look closely, one year in Bihar did not prove to be auspicious for the NDA
 bihar main aise to rajg kii sarkaar chalati rahi, magar uske dost unhen chhodte rahe
 In the first half of the year, if Manjhi is with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) -led grand alliance, then in the latter part of the year, Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) has also opted out of the NDA
 Announced kushvaha ne na keval kendriya mantri ke pad istipha de diya, balki rajg ke virdohi kheme mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Kushwaha was already angry at not being given preference for Lok Sabha seat sharing, but left the NDA, alleging that he was not given respect in the NDA
 vaise, nitish kumaar kii jad (you) ko rajg main shaamil hone ke baad se hi kushvaha rajg main asahaj mahasoos kar rahe the
 In such a situation, the RLSP did not like to discuss seat sharing with JD (U) by BJP and Kushwaha took a different route from NDA

 It is as if everything has become zero
 mana jaataa he ki faansee lagane ke baad 1 minute tak kisi jaan nahin jaati he
 If you try, it can be saved, then when you are looking at it, it is standing on the tree in front of you, but people in Delhi kept watching Gajendra Singh like a spectacle? 
 manch se kuch hi duuri parkisaan gajendra singhped par chadhe aatmahatya kii dhamkee dete rahe or kisi ne unhen bachaane kii koshish nahin kii
 The country should know how many seconds it would have taken if any person had come down from the stage of suicide if the man had committed suicide and tried to come to that tree
 sambhav tha ki kejariwal yaa koi bhi usase jaakar baatcheet karata, to shaayad sthiti kuch or ho sakati thi
 See in the video, if there had been an attempt, it would have taken a few seconds to reach the farmer Gajendra Singh and could have been saved

 bangalore bijli aapurti company (besakaam)ke adhikari forencik visheshgyon ke saath ghatnasthal par pahunch gayi hai
 Reddy said the cause of the fire remains to be ascertained
 sarhad par jaan kii baaji lagaakar har vakt desh kii suraksha karne vaale jawan ab thagi kaa shikaar ho rahe hai
 Fraud is also such that there is no clue
 rajdhani dilli main javaanon ko thagne kii aisi hi kuch ghatnaayen saamne ai he
 While investigating this, even the senses of the police are blown away
 philhal police is maamle kii baariki se padtaal kar rahi he
 Military officers, jawans made to soldiers, in Delhi, many incidents have occurred, not one, not two, of army soldiers and officers
 police kii shuruuaati padtaal main javaanon ko thagne vaale ek 'skimar gang' kaa khulaasa hua he
 In fact, Delhi Police has received many complaints from Indian Army officers to jawans for some time
 jisamen koi unke bank acount se unki mehnat kii gadhi kamai saaf kar rahaa he
 They come to know about this when they get their account statement out
 mehnat kii kamai pal bhar main safaise hi sena ke ek jawan vijay ne bhi uske saath huidhokhadhadeeki shikaayat dilli kaint thane main di
 Vijay told that he has been serving the country for the last 9 years
 is dauraan unhone ek-ek rupaya jodakar kareeb do lakh rupee kii apane selary acount main bachat kii thi
 On July 1, when he went to withdraw money from his account, the ground slipped under his feet
 inaki mehnat kii kamai par koi haath saaf kar gaya tha
 While Vijay's ATM card was with him
 police ne jab is maamle kii jaanch shuru kii to pataa chalaa ki vijay hi nahin balki sena ke kai afasaron or javaanon ke saath bhi aisa hi hua he
 As the investigation progressed, even the police became aware
 darasal 24-25 june kii raat vijay ke acount se paise nikaale gaye the
 When the police saw the CCTV footage, two suspects were seen in it
 hairaan karne vaali baat ye thi ki vijay kaa atm card to unheen ke paas tha to phir ye donon shaks vijay ke acount se paise kaise nikaal le gaye
 Eat food in expensive hotels and shopping of Badmash had eaten and bought food in expensive hotels with the money of Vijay and other soldiers
 is puure maamle main police ke saamne kai sawaal the
 After all, how did the two miscreants carry out this incident with officers and jawans without stealing ATM cards
 har tranjaction ke bare main unhen kyon nahin pataa chalaa
 Also why this gang is behind the Indian soldiers only
 vaardaat ke liye 'skimar divaais' kaa istemaaldarasal dilli police kii tafteesh jab aage badi to police ko pataa chalaa ki in badmaashon ne dilli kaint ke ek atm par 'skimar divaais' lagaaya tha
 a 'skimmer device' is an electronic device that looks exactly like a card insert machine inside an ATM
 is divaais ko atm ke card incert mashin ke upar laga diya jaataa he
 After this, as soon as someone puts their card in it, this 'skimmer device' saves the information of that card
 saath hi badmaash atm ke andar ek hiden camera bhi laga dete he jisase wo password bhi dekh lete he
 After all, the army personnel use the same information to make this 'skimmer gang' new ATM cards
 phir un atm card se cash nikaal letaa he yaa phir shopping karata he
 The question also arises why the jawans do not get his message after every transaction
 darasal sena kii naukari main transfar or posting ke thikaane badalte rahete he
 Often, where they are posted, either they do not get the signal or they cannot keep the mobile with them due to security reasons
 isi baat kaa phayda uthaakar ye gang sena ke javaanon ko nishaanaa bana rahaa he
 Now the biggest challenge before the police is to put these miscreants behind bars
 philhal police sisitivi footage se mili sandigdh chehron kii talash main sargarmi se juty he
 At the same time, the police are seen saying to destroy the network of this 'skimmer gang' even before raising its head

 He said, "unless the entire political system is able to deal with it effectively, there will be no peace in the country
" ’ adwani ne kaha ki ucchtam nyaayalay or kaig samet sanvaidhanik sansthaanon tathaa media ne desh ko pareshaan karne vaale is mudde ko kaaphi prabhavi dhang se uthaaya he
 In this context, he cited Commonwealth Games, Adarsh residential Society and twog spectrum scam
 madhya pradesh membhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) main chal rahaa andruni kalamb khulkar saamne aane laga he
 Party workers are resorting to anonymous letters to attack their leaders
 party kaaryakartaaon kii baithak lene aae varisht netaa venkaiya naidu par parche ke jariye hamalaa bolaa gaya he
 His leadership ability has been questioned in this paper
 nai kaaryakarini ke gathan ke baad tomars ne rajya se lekar jila str tak ke party padaadhikariyon kii pehali baithak varisht netaa venkaiya naidu kii maujuudagi main bulaai
 On Thursday, a disputed form was distributed before Naidu reached the meeting
 is parche main kaha gaya he ki varsh 1993 main naidu ke grih rajya andhra pradesh main bhaajapa ke 34 vidhayak the or aaj ek bhi nahin he
 In 20 years, why is the condition of BJP in Andhra Pradesh that there is not a single MLA
 parchen main aage kaha gaya he ki bangaluru ke nagar nigam chunaav main naidu kaa bhatija usee ward se buree tarah haara, jahaan unka ghar he
 In the end, the question has been raised that who has not got a single MLA in his own state, what right does he have to give election tips in another state
 rajya main bhaajapa ke sanghathan main hue badlaav ke baad se hi andruni taur par khinchataan chal rahi he, pehle nae adhyaksh narendra singh tomars dwaara banaai gai kaaryakarini main sthaan paane ke liye netaaon main jor aajamaaish chali
 Those who have found the place are happy, and those who have not got the place are seen standing in the queue of dissidents

 Talking about Tomar's coronation program, then outgoing president Prabhat Jha attacked Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan indirectly
 unhone apane ko adhyaksh pad se hataae jane kii tulana pokharan visphot se kar di thi
 The leaflet allegedly distributed by a BJP worker has exposed the internal infighting within the party
 naidu par sawaal uthaane ke peeche unke madhya pradesh main badhane vaale sambhavit prabhaav ko pehle hi roak dene kii koshish ke taur par bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 During the tenure of Nitin Gadkari, Ananth Kumar used to dominate the state, but now after Rajnath Singh became the national president, Naidu's influence is increasing
 party ke pradeshdhyaksh tomars is parche ko sasti lokapriyata kaa hatkandaa bataate hue kehete hai ki yah party kaaryakarta nahin bahari vyakti kaa kaam he
 Experts say that infighting in the BJP from the national level to the state level is at its peak and no one wants to let go of the opportunity to attack each other
 yahi kaaran he ki venkaiya madhya pradesh main aae or un par parche se hamalaa bolaa gaya
 Not only this, this paper must have been prepared from outside not in the state, because the political situation of Andhra Pradesh is rarely known by the people of Madhya Pradesh

 Rajan cited demonetisation and GST as a major reason for the break on India's economic pace, as well as the current growth rate was insufficient
 rajan ne piemo kii bhoomika par bhi sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki bharat main bahut saare nirnyon main piemo kaa dakhal bhi tamaam dikkaton main se ek he
 Former Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan called demonetisation and Goods and Services Tax (GST) two major bottlenecks in the country's economic growth that affected the pace of growth last year
 unhone is baat par jor diya ki saat pratishat kii maujuuda vruddhi dar desh kii jaruraton ke hisaab se paryaapt nahin he
 According to the language of two consecutive tremors, Rajan said at the University of California at Berkeley on Friday that India's economic growth during the four years between 2012 and 2016 was very fast before demonetisation and GST were affected by these two issues
 bharat ke bhavishya par yojit dwitiya bhattacharya vyaakhyaan main rajan ne kaha ki notebandi or jiesti ke do lagaataar jhatkon ne desh kii aarthik vruddhi par gambhir asar daalaa
 The country's growth rate started falling at a time when the global economic growth rate was catching pace

 He said that the truth is that the kind of people who are joining the labor market, seven percent is not enough for them
 hamen adhik rojgaar srujit karne kii jarurat he
 We cannot be satisfied at this stage
 do jhatkon ke chalate 2017 main kam thi vikaas kii raftarajan ne vaishvik vruddhi ke prati bharat ke samvedansheel hone kii baat sweekaar karte hue kaha ki bharat ab kaaphi khuli arthvyavastha he
 If the world grows, India also grows
 unhone kaha ki 2017 main yah hua ki vishwa kii vruddhi ke gati pakadaney ke baad bhi bharat kii raftaar sust padi
 This suggests that these tremors (demonetisation and GST) were indeed deep shocks
 in jhatkon ke kaaran hamen thithakna padaa
 The rising price of crude oil made it even more difficult
 Rajan referred to the country's dependence on oil imports to meet the energy needs in relation to the challenge of rising crude prices in front of the Indian economy
 purv governor ne kaha ki kachche tel kii keemten badhane se gharelu arthvyavastha ke samaksh paristhitiyaan thodi mushkil hongi, bhale hi desh notebandi or jiesti kii rukaawaton se ubarne laga ho
 Regarding the rising NPA, he said that it would be better to clean such situation
 rajan ne kaha ki yah jaruri he ki buree chizon se nipta jaae, taaki balance shit saaf ho or bank waapas patari par laut saken
 It has taken India a long time to clear the banks, partly because the system did not have the means to deal with bad debts
 har maheene 10 lakh rojgaar kii jaruratrajan ne kaha ki diwaala evam rinshodhan aakshamata samhita bainkon ke khaaton ko saaf suthra banane main akele sakasham nahin ho sakati he
 He said that this is only one element of the larger scheme of such cleanliness
 desh main enpie kii chunauti se nipatane ke liye bahustareey rukh apnaane kii jarurat he
 He said that if we grow at less than seven percent, then there are definitely some mistakes
 unhone kaha ki bharat ko is aadhaar par kam se kam agle 10-15 saal tak vruddhi kerani hogi
 He said that India needs to create 10 lakh jobs per month for new people joining the labor force
 bharat ke saamne ye teen badi dikkatenrajan ne kaha ki desh ke saamne abhi teen dikkatein hai
 The first problem is the bumpy infrastructure
 unhone kaha ki nirmaan vah udyog he jo arthvyavastha ko shuruaati charan main chalaata he
 After that growth is created by infrastructure
 unhone kaha ki doosraa alpakaalik lakshya bijli kshetra kii sthiti ko behatar bananaa ho saktaa he
 It should be ensured that the electricity generated annually reaches those who need it
 teesraa mudda bainkon ke karj khaaton ko saaf suthra bananaa he
 On the PMO also, Shradarajan said that part of the problem in India is that the political decision making system is more centralized
 rajan ne kaha ki bharat centre se kaam nahin kar saktaa he
 India works when many people are carrying the burden
 aaj ke samay main centre sarkaar behad kendrikrut he
 He said, an example of this is that consent of the Prime Minister's Office is necessary for many decisions

 i drank water that night: Salman leaves Salman at 3 pm
 sarkari vakil kehete hai ki wo nashe main the par salaaman khan kehete hai ki unhone us raat baar main sirf pani piya tha
 He had a white Toyota Land Cruiser car that night to go home
 gaadi chalaane ke liye saath main bodyguard kam driver bhi
 Around 3 am, American Express Bakery Hill Road, Bandrasalaman's car reaches Bandra Hill Road at around 3 pm in the dark of night
 gaadi kii siftaar behad tej thi, lihaaza hill road par american express bekri se kuch pehle hi achaanak driver gaadi kaa santulan kho baithta he or pal bhar main gaadi bain taraf se sadak chhod kar footpath par daudane lagati he
 Five employees working at the American Express Bakery were sleeping on the same sidewalk at that time from Badnasibi
 tej raftaar land kruger pancho ko raudate hue aage nikalati he or phir dukaan ke shater se takaraa kar gaadi ruk jaati he
 According to Salman police, Salman Khan suddenly gets nervous after leaving the vehicle and disappears from the spot
 gaadi ke footpath se takaraane or ghayalon kii cheekh-pukaar sun kar aasapaas so rahe baaki log bhi jaag jate hai
 People pull out the people trapped under the car and are taken to the hospital
 salmaan kuch der baad gaadi maukey par hi chhod kar gaayab ho jaate hai par 70 mem kii screen se bhi jiskaa kad bada ho, uski ek jhalak use pahchaanane ke liye kaaphi hoti he
 Many people had recognized Salman before running away
 ek kii maut chaar buree tarah jakhmihadase main ek mazdoor kareeb-kareeb maukey par hi dam tod detaa he, jabaki chaar majdoor buree tarah se jakhmi ho jate hai
 The legs of most of the four were trampled by the car
 chaar ghayalon main se ek muslim niamat shaikh ne shuruuaat main police ko bataaya tha ki haadase ke vakt wo so rahaa tha tabhi jor kii aawaaj ke saath uske baayen pair par kuch vajani cheez chadhi jisase uski aankh khul gai
 Sheikh said that he had seen Salman Khan coming down from the driver's seat ie the right door of the car but later in the Magistrate Court, Sheikh said that he did not see Salman getting off the driver's seat
 aag kii tarah fail gaya thi haadase kii khabarhaadase kii khabar ko failte bhi der nahin lagi par salmaan haadase ke baad maukey se gaayab ho chuke the police ghar pahunchi to wo ghar par bhi nahin mili
 But Salman, Salman Khan was difficult to hide, so after about eight hours, he himself comes out
 haalanki bambai hike court ne apane faisle main salmaan ke maukey se bhaagane ko sahi bataaya he
 By morning, the news had spread all over Mumbai
 salmaan khan ke daaman par ek or daag lag chukaa tha par haadase ke baad se khud salmaan gaayab the
 But the vehicle number and the eyewitnesses had chewed up against Salman
 lihaaza subah-subah police salmaan ke ghar pahunchati he par salmaan ghar par nahin the
 For the first time, the Badra police arrested Salman
 Salman Khan wanted some time for legal advice
 isiilie wo gaayab the, par unhen pataa tha ki zyada der bhaagane se mushkilen bad sakati hai
 There will be difficulty in getting bail
 lihaaza haadase ke kareeb aath ghante baad wo khud saamne aate hai or aakhirkaar bandra police police unhen giraftaar kar leti he
 After the arrest, Salman is taken to JJ Hospital
 jahaan salmaan kaa blad sample liya jaataa he
 a non-willful murder case has been registered against Salman and the police register a case of negligence and dangerous driving against Mangal
 gairajamaanti dhara ke chalate giraftaar ke kuch der baad hi unhen mahaj 950 rupye ke jurmaane ke saath zamaanat par reeha bhi kar diya jaataa he
 Some social organizations protest against Salman's release so easily and reach court on 5 October 2002
 wo adaalat main salmaan ke khilaaf ek janhit yachika daakhil kar salmaan par gaiyr iradatan hatya kaa mukadmaa darj karne kii maang karte hai
 Salman gets bail on October 24, 2002, the court not only accepts the petition but also orders the police to file a case against Salman under Section 304-2 of the IPC ie culpable homicide not amounting to murder
 iske tahat adhiktam sazaa das saal kaid he
 On 7 October 2002, police arrest Salman again for culpable homicide not amounting to a court order
 salmaan jail chale jate hai
 They remain in jail for the entire 18 days
 is dauraan wo chaar baar jamaanat kii arji dete hai
 But the bail application is rejected four times
 phir aakhirkaar 18 din baad 24 aktubar 2002 ko salmaan ko jamaanat mil jaati he or wo reeha ho jate hai
 After the first major relief to Salman, Bombay High Court Serihai, Salman Khan challenges his decision to file a case of non-accidental murder against him in the Mumbai Sessions Court in March 2003, but within two months, the Sessions Court in May 2003 was not only his The application is dismissed, but the magistrate court orders to prepare a charge sheet against Salman
 salmaan ne kanoonee ladaai jari rakhi
 They now challenge the Sessions Court's decision in the Bombay High Court to remove the section of self-imposed murder
 is cese me salmaan ko yahaan pehali raahat milti he
 The Bombay High Court removes Section 304 of the IPC
 court kaa kahana tha ki is cese main ye dhara feet nahin baithti
 The Supreme Court overturned the decision of the Bombay High Court, but Salman's part came down to little happiness, as the Maharashtra government reached the Supreme Court in October 2003 against the Bombay High Court verdict
 uski daleel thi ki maamla gaiyr iradatan hatya kaa hi banataa he
 Salman Khan received the biggest blow from the Supreme Court in December 2003 after a two-month wait
 supim court ne bombai hai court ke faisle ko patalte hue kaha ki salmaan par gaiyr iradatan hatya kaa mukadmaa chale yaa naa chale iskaa faisla magistrate court karegi
 Now that the magistrate court had already ordered the police to file a charge sheet against Salman under Section 304-2 of the IPC, the bus trial was yet to begin
 mumbai police salmaan khan ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 304(II) ke alaava meter vical act 1988 or bombai prohibeshan act 1949 ke tahat dhara 279, 337, 338 or 427 ke adheen mukadmaa darj kar leti he
 Chargesheet has four charges against Salman Chargesheet has four big charges against Salman Khan
 pehla, haadase ke vakt salmaan khan hi toeta land kruger car chalaa rahe the
 Second, Salman's car was extremely fast
 teesraa, haadase ke baad salmaan maukey se bhaag gaye the or chauthaa us raat salmaan ne saamaanya maatra se zyada sharaab pi thi
 Most of these charges were based on the statements of Salman's security guard and Mumbai Police constable Ravindra Patil
 patil ne hi sabase pehle police ko bayaan diya tha ki baar se nikalne ke baad salmaan nashe main the or uske manaa karne ke baad bhi vahi gaadi chalaa rahe the or gaadi kii raftaar bhi kareeb 90 se 100 kilomir prati ghanta thi
 But on behalf of Salman Khan, it was said in the court that the night the accident took place, Ravindra Patil was sleeping in the car all the way
 use kuch pataa hi nahin tha
 Ravindra Patil in his first statement did not even tell the police that Salman was drunk on the night of the accident, rather he said this after four months
 cese main aate rahe kai modchargeshit daakhil hone ke baad mukadmaa court main chalata rahaa
 During this time there are several turns in the case
 sabase pehle salmaan kii taraf se kaha jaataa he ki us raat wo gaadi chalaa hi nahin rahe the
 Rather, his driver was driving Ashok Singh
 salmaan ne sharaab pine kii baat se bhi inkaar kiya
 Also accused that his blood sample was deliberately changed
 jeje aspataal ke dactor shashikant pavaar ne shuruuaati bayaan main kaha tha ki salmaan ne pehle apana blad sample dene se manaa kar diya tha, magar unke munh se sharaab kii bu aa rahi thi
 Later in front of the magistrate, Dr
 Shashikant said that it is difficult to say that Salman's mouth was smelling boo
 jahaan tak blead sample kii baat thi to salmaan ke vakil kaa kahana tha ki us sample ke saath chhedchhad kii gai he
 It was argued that on that day two different blood sample vials were sent to the lab, but they did not have a name chit
 ashok singh ke bayaan se aayaa chaunkaane vaala modais cese main kul 28 gavaah pesh hue par inamen se sirf ek gavaah salmaan khan kii taraf se tha driver ashok singh, baaki 27 gavaahon ne abhiyojan paksh kii taraf se salmaan ke khilaaf gavaahi di inamen se kai gavaah es the jo baad main palat gaye
 The Bombay High Court therefore did not believe the witnesses
 is cese kaa sabase ahm or chaunkaane vaala mode tab aayaa jab adaalat main bahes or daleel ab bas khatm hone ja rahi thi, tabhi bees april 2015 ko achaanak adaalat main ashok singh naam kaa ek shaks pahunchataa he
 He describes himself as the driver of Salman Khan and his father Salim Khan
 ashok singh ke adaalat main die bayaan ke mutabik wo 1990 se khan parivaar kaa driver he ashok singh ne bataaya ki 28 sitambar kii us raat land kruger salmaan khan nahin balki wo chalaa rahaa tha
 The court asked 419 questions on Salman, when the court asked him, why is he telling this thing after 13 years, then Ashok Singh said that a wheel of the car was broken that night, due to which the balance of the car was disturbed and he Climbed the pavement
 iske baad salmaan ke kehane par usee ne usne sau number par police ko kol kiya phir vahaan se wo bandra police thane gaya jahaan wo chaar baje subah tak rukaa rahaa or usne usee raat police ko sab kuch bataa diya tha
 During the trial Salman Khan was asked a total of 419 questions by the court
 sawaal beshak alag-alag the
 But until the end Salman Khan kept convincing the court that neither he had drunk liquor nor was he driving that night, nor did he have an accident because his driver Ashok Singh was driving
 'sabit nahin hota ki car salmaan hi chalaa rahe the'lekin bombai city or civil seshans court ke seshan jaj di dablyoo deshpandey ne 6 may ko din main kareeb dedh baje salmaan kii tamaam daleelon ko darkinar karte hue unhen american bekri hit and ran cese kaa mujrim maanate hue 5 saal jail kii or 25000 hazaar rupye ke jurmaane kaa faisla suna diya
 The same decision was challenged by Salman in Bombay High Court
 or aakhirkaar 13 saal baad salmaan ke haq main sabase bada faisla aayaa
 The entire court stood on the statement of one of the most important witnesses i
e
 Constable Ravindra Patil, that the High Court did not consider the same Ravindra Patil statement to be trustworthy
 saath hi ye bhi kaha ki gavaah or saboot mail nahin khate
 It does not prove that Salman was driving the car that night
 isiilie sabooton ke abhaav main shaq kaa laabh dete hue dhanhen tamaam aaropon se bari kiya jaataa he

 Parasrana said that the presence of the deity is not the sole criterion of a trial being a judicial person
 unhone bataaya ki nadiyon kii puja kii jaati he, rugveda ke anusaar surya ek devtaa he

 kyonki wo ek murti nahin, balki ek devtaa hai
 We consider him a living being
 11
 26 AM: During the hearing, Ramlala's lawyer K
 paraasaran ne kaha ki janmasthan ko lekar sateek sthaan kii aavashyaktaa nahin he, lekin aasapaas ke kshetron main bhi iskaa matlab ho saktaa he
 He said that both the Hindu and Muslim sides call the disputed area the birthplace
 isliye isamen koi vivaad nahin he ki ye bhagwaan ram kaa janmasthan he
 He said that Ramlala was made a party to the case when the magistrate attached his property under Section 145 of the CRPC
 iske baad civil court ne vahaan kuch bhi karne se roak laga di
 The lawyer told the court that the court had refused to consider Ramjanmabhoomi as a matter, so Ramlala had to become a party
 kyonki ramalala naaballig hai, isliye unke dost mukadmaa lard rahe hai
 He told that first Devkinandan Agarwal fought this case, now Trilokinath Pandey is fighting
 10
 40 AM: The hearing in the Ayodhya case has started
 sunwaayee kii shuruyaat main sunni vakf board kii taraf se rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki nirmohi akhaada-vakf board ne alag-alag suut daakhil kiye gaye hai, agar unki baat suni gai he to hamaari bhi suni jaani chahie
 Now on behalf of Ramlala
 paraasaran apni baat rakh rahe hai
 Ramlala's lawyers said that after the arguments of the sentiments of the erstwhile Nirmohi Akhada ended, Ramlala's lawyers started speaking
 vakil paraasaran ne is dauraan ram mandir ke nirmaan ko hinduon kii bhaawanaaon se judaa masalaa bataaya or kaha ki adaalat ko is par faisla lenaa chahie
 The lawyer during this time mentioned mythological facts including Valmiki Ramayana, Mahabharata, Purana
 7 agast ko ayodhya maamle par puri bahes yahaan clic kar padhein
 
 
 The court asked many questions during the hearing, the bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and other judges asked the lawyers directly
 jab ramalala ke vakeelon kii taraf se bhaawanaaon kaa zikr kiya gaya to justise bobade ne poocha tha ki kya kabhi aisa duusare deshon main hua he ki do samudaay dharmik sthal ko lekar aamane-saamne ho
 Apart from this, he had a question whether Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem? Not only this, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi had asked Nirmohi Akhara to present the evidence related to Ramjanmabhoomi
 6 agast ko ayodhya maamle par puri bahes yahaan clic kar padhein
 
 
 The way the arbitration could not come out, let me tell you that on this issue, the Supreme Court had earlier ordered to adopt the path of arbitration
 lekin is raste ke tahat baat nahin bani, jiske baad supreme court ne 6 agast se is masale par rojaanaa sunwaayee karne ko kaha
 Weekly three working day hearings are held under the daily hearing in the Supreme Court

 Joshi had alleged that sex toys such as lube, desensitizer, spray were being sold illegally

 Everyone has a different opinion about Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code
 supreme court se is sambandh main antim faisla aana baaki he ki dhara 377 ke tahat samalangikta yaa aprakritik sex karnaa aparaadh he yaa nahin
 Homosexuality is still a crime under Section 377: Homosexuality is considered an offense under Section 377 of the Supreme Court

 The Supreme Court, in its order in December 2013, upheld Section 377 and considered homosexuality a crime
 is maamle main supreme court ne 2009 main dilli hoicourt ke us aadesh ko bhi khaarij kar diya jisamen samalangik sex ko jurm nahin mana gaya tha
 The Supreme Court had said that Parliament should take the final decision in this regard

 It will be interesting to see how the government reacts against the court action

 Meanwhile, a meeting of NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Congress President Sonia Gandhi was held on Monday, in which the picture has not been clear about the formation of the government
 lekin khabar he ki koi faisla lene se pehle donon partiyaan phoonk-phoonk kar kadam rakhana chaahati hai
 The news that is being filtered in the meeting of sonia-pawar in Delhi is that the Congress President wants that all the issues should be discussed before the decision to form the government
 phir chaahe wo mantri pad ho yaa phir korporation tak kaa maamla hi kyon naa ho
 Sonia Gandhi believes that she does not want a situation like Karnataka again, where there was constant rhetoric after forming the government with JDS
 sutron kii maane to sonia gandhi ke is tark par NCP pramukh sharad pavaar ne bhi hami bhari he
 Sharad Pawar also wants that no decision should be taken in a hurry

 After this it was decided that the state leaders of both the parties should have some more talks, so that all things can be clear

 During the press conference on Monday, Sharad Pawar (photo: PTI) first came out to give this formula that earlier when it came to talk about political slang between ncp-shiv Sena and Congress, a formula was revealed
 jisamen shivasena ko paanch saal mukhyamantri pad or congress-ensipi kaa dipti siem ho saktaa he
 Apart from this, the formula of 14-14-12 on ministerial posts was revealed, although no official confirmation was found on them
 baithak ke baad kya bole the pavaar?somvaar ko jab sharad pavaar congress adhyaksh se mulaakaat kar baahar aae to unhone kaha ki donon ke bich sarkaar gathan ko lekar koi baat nahin hui he
 The political situation of Maharashtra is discussed only because the two parties contested together
 sarkaar gathan ko lekar baat nahin hui he
 Apart from this, when Sharad Pawar was asked a question on Tuesday, he said that those who want to form the government should ask questions

 Director Neeraj Pandey is making a film on Mahendra Singh Dhoni but no actress name was finalized for the role of Sakshi in the film
 ab film ke lieectreska naam final kar liya gaya he
 Now Kiara Advani will be seen playing the character opposite Sushunt Singh Rajput opposite Sakshi in the film
 film se jude sutara bataate hai, 'sakshike role ke liye sahi pasand chunanaa kaaphi mushkil kaam tha kyonki jaahir he log tulana karenge
 The director wanted a young face who did not do much films

 Ask any medical or engineering student, it will say that only one point was left behind from 'distraction'
 sachin jaise khilaadi ke liye ise oont ke munh main jire kii tarah kah sakate hai, jiske liye cricket ke khel main shatak bananaa pav-bhaaji khaane jaisaa asana or mjedaar kaam ho
 Thousands of spectators were sitting in the field and crores in their respective homes, hoping for three points in the last innings of Tendalya
 sachin do ankon par out hue or bharat rashtriya shok main dub gaya
 The nineties were again remembered, when watching cricket meant Sachin's batting
 unke 100 shatak yaa 34000 ran kii baaten sun or padhakar ham sab ab tak 'sachinology' main kaaphi vidwaan ho chuke honge, lekin ye samajhnaa or bhi jaruri he ki sachin tendulkar hona or bananaa kitna kathin he
 The common saying in the education world is that a teacher's children are 'set' with great difficulty, and above all when Mataji is an insurance agent, every other person will say that the elder is a 'typical Indian middle class family'

 Vinod Kambli, who was a 'partner in crime' in school, when he scored 2 double centuries at the beginning of his Test career and people call Kambli more than you, so get the status of 'lord of Cricket' from 'tendalya'
 The same one Sachin Tendulkar is made in millions
 alam ye rahaa tha ki jab sachin shatak lagaakar match jitaaye, to puure desh main diwali manaai jaati thi or unke out hote hi aadhe log to gusse main tivi dekhnaa band kar dete the or aadhe log aalochak ho jate the
 Sachin's bat did not bat in India's defeat, but these people remember early, but who scored 100 centuries, which no one could have imagined 2 decades ago, who created that history, only one Sachin Tendulkar in millions It is made
 jis par kabhi vigyapanon par adhik dhyaan dene kaa aarope lage, to kabhi dabi jubaan se match phixing kaa aarope, kabhi kaha jaae ki yah records ke liye kheltaa he, to kabhi sanyas lene kaa dabaav ho, itani baari aalochana or dabaav ke bich bhi jo shaks ek shila kii tarah majboot or vajra kii tarah dridhtaa se data rahe, vahi lakhon main ek sachin tendulkar banataa he
 The truth is that it is the player who taught the people born in the 80s and 90s to love cricket, who explained how to maintain humility even after reaching the pinnacle of greatness, who taught that hard work and perseverance is one a boy from an ordinary family can become the star of the nation's eyes, even though Sachin Tendulkar is now moving away from the playground, the same is true for Sachin "

 Kumar Vishwas, who is said to be upset with the AAP leadership and its policies, has been persuaded at the PAC meeting
 vahiin kumaar vishwaas par sawaal uthaane vaale amanatulla khan ko party kii praathmik sadsyta se nilambit kar diya gaya he
 After the PAC meeting held at the house of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Kumar Vishwas while addressing the media said that this is not a battle of supremacy
 party sanyojak banane kaa meraa koi iraadaa nahin
 i had some concerns and disagreements
 jab bhi aisi sthiti aati he, to hameshaa vichaar-vimarsh kiya jaataa rahanaa chahie
 Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, present with Vishwas, announced in front of the media that Jamia Nagar MLA Amanatullah Khan, who questioned Kumar Vishwas, has been suspended from the primary member of the party
 iske saath hi unhone vishwaas ko party kii rajasthan ikai kaa prabharee banane kaa elaan kiya
 After being suspended, Amanatullah said that this is the decision of the party
 main ek kaaryakarta hum, jo aap main duusari party se aayaa tha
 What can i say agar kumaar vishwaas kah rahe hai ki unki khilaaf sajeesh hui he to bataaen ki mere peeche koun he
 Manish Sisodia also came to meet Amanatullah
 kumaar vishwaas kii thim ye maangen
 
 
 Earlier there was speculation that Kumar Vishwas, who was angry with the AAP leadership, should not attend the party's PAC meeting
 haalanki in atakalon ko viraam dete hue is baithak main shaamil hue
 According to sources, he kept his demands in the PAC meeting
 ' isse pehle sutron ne bataaya ki vishwaas is baithak main party ke bheetar bhrashtachar ke maamle tathaa sanghathan main badlaav ke mudde par charchaa karenge
 Along with this, AAP workers will demand to implement the plan they have prepared to be given a chance inside the party
 sutron ke mutabik, kumaar vishwaas ne yah saaf kiya he ki vah video ko lekar koi maafee nahi maangenge
 However, he has also said that he will not oppose the issue of nationalism
 sutron kii maane to unhone jamiya nagar se AAP vidhayak amanatulla khan par kadi karrwai kii bhi maang kii he
 Kumar Vishwas's emotional bet Earlier on Tuesday, Kumar Vishwas first got emotional and openly spoke of differences within the party
 iske baad manish sisodiya ne kumaar vishwaas ke khilaaf morcha khol diya
 However, later many party leaders reached Kumar Vishwas's house and then also reached Kejriwal and took out Kumar Vishwas with them, saying that they would be persuaded
 iske baad kareeb ek ghante tak kumaar vishwaas kejariwal ke ghar rahe or baad main bina kuch bole nikal pade
 All eyes are now on the next step of Kumar Vishwas and the rapidly changing developments in the Aam Aadmi Party
 kumaar vishwaas ke saath patni bhi maujuud thimkejariwal ke ghar meeting ke baad baahar nikalate vakt khaas baat yah thi ki kumaar vishwaas ke saath unki patni bhi maujuud thim
 In this meeting held at Kejriwal's house, apart from Kumar Vishwas, Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, Ashutosh were included
 jabaki thodi der baad aap mantri kapil mishra bhi baithak main shaamil hue the
 Kapil Mishra is considered close to Kumar Vishwas in the party
 kejariwal kii meeting jari rahijankaree ke mutabik meeting se baahar nikalne ke baad kumaar vishwaas or kapil mishra sidhe apane-apane ghar pahunche
 Whereas Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh and Ashutosh continued to consult at the Chief Minister's residence
 kumaar vishwaas ko manaa lenge- kejariwalisase pehle mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal manish sisodiya ke saath kumaar vishwaas ko manaane unke ghar gaye the
 Kejriwal came to the Chief Minister's residence after meeting him
 gajiabad main hui mulaakaat ke baad media se baatcheet main kejariwal ne kaha ki kumaar vishwaas ko manaa lenge
 Vishwas had given the deadline: Saddened by the state of affairs and recent events, Kumar Vishwas fixed Monday night's deadline for his next move
 jiske baad tamaam aap netaa unhen manaane unke ghar pahunche the
 The supporters staged a protest
 Meanwhile, supporters of Kumar Vishwas shouted slogans in front of his house and started a sit-in at the gate to take action against MLA Amanatullah
 vishwaas par lagaae gaye aaropon par unke samarthak sahamat nahin he
 According to supporters, the party's top leadership is ignoring the activists
 kendriya parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ne 'i-rickshaw' ke mudde par safai di he
 a statement issued by his office said that Gadkari and any of his relatives did not have any relationship with any company that produces e-rickshaws
 isse pehle ek angreji akhbaar ne khabar di thi ki gadakari ne jis 'kalyankari' yojana kaa elaan kiya tha, uskaa phayda gadakari ke parivaar se judi ek company ko hoga
 Two weeks ago, when Gadkari announced a change in the law to end the ban on 'e-rickshaws', eliminate registration on e-rickshaws and give a loan at three per cent interest to buy it, it did a lot Was welcomed ise 'deen dayaal yojana' kaa naam diya gaya tha
 But now the English newspaper 'the Indian Express' claims that Gadkari's decision will benefit Delhi's one lakh e-rickshaw drivers as well as a company associated with Gadkari's family
 yaad rahe ki gadakari peshewar taur par bijnesaman hi hai
 Will Gadkari's brother-in-law company benefit? According to the newspaper, the name of this Nagpur-based company is 'purti Green Technologies Private Limited' (PGT)
 2011 main jab yah company register kii gai thi, iske founder gadakari hi the
 He was also the chairman of the company till 2011
 philhal iske diarector gadakari ke bahanoi rajesh totade hai
 PGT is one of the seven companies licensed by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)
 abhi company ko motor kii shakti ko lekar milane vaali raahat kaa intjaar he taaki vah bydaree-chaalit rickshaw bana saken
 According to Rajesh, the center is preparing to make changes to the motor vehicle act and we are also ready to launch our product in the market
 gadakari kii faisle se company kii baanchhein khilickhbaar ke mutabik, rajesh usee raahat ke bare main zikr kar rahe hai, jiskaa zikr gadakari ne 17 june ko rajdhani main yojit i-rickshaw chaalkon kii raily main zikr kiya tha
 Gadkari had said, "e-rickshaws with 650 w motor capacity will be considered as non-motorized vehicles
 transport department or trephic police unka chaalaan nahin kar paaegi
 Gadkari also promised that the Motor Vehicle Act would be changed in 1988, as at present, only vehicles with a 250 watt motor capacity and a maximum speed of 25 km per hour are considered non-motorized
 or jab is bare main gadakari se poocha gaya
 
 
 The newspaper emailed Gadkari to ask whether getting the approval of the company to make an e-rickshaw while on his ministerial post is not a matter of 'conflict of interest'? In response, Gadkari has said that many companies are making these e-rickshaws and there is no monopoly of any company nor there is any restriction on anyone
 gadakari ne kaha, jahaan tak i-rickshaw maalikon ko 3 pratishat dar par lone lene ke liye bainkon ko protsaahit karne kaa maamla he, main is bare main piem narendra modi or vitt mantri arun jetali ko likh chukaa hum
 Gadkari is talking about 2 crore e-rickshaws across the country
 bydaree chaalit rickshaw kii ausat keemat 70 hajaar se ek lakh rupee ke bich hoti he
 In such a situation, companies like PGT are desperate to jump into the new market of e-rickshaws
 gadakari ne kiya tha elaangauratlab he ki kuch hi din pehle parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ne vaada kiya tha ki i rickshaw par bain nahin lagegaa
 He assured the rickshaw pullers that they do not need to go to any office for registration
 gadakari ne kaha kii emsidi hi i rickshaw kaa registration karegi, saath hi vahi pahchaan patr degi
 Registration of e-rickshaw will be for only Rs 100
 iske alaava i-rickshaw kaa naam dinadayal i rickshaw kiya jayega
 Significantly, earlier, Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal had also advocated for the e-rickshaws
 kejariwal i rickshaw par baithkar dilli ke up rajyapal se milane gaye the
 The e-rickshaw-pullers had demonstrated in Delhi and cried their grief to the new government at the Center
 pichley saal 12 sitambar ko dilli hoicourt se i rickshaw par bain lagane kii maang kii gai thi
 It was said in the petition that neither its registration is done nor any number plate
 naa hi iskaa insurance cover hota he, yahaan tak kii ise fitness certificate bhi nahin miltaa
 Rejecting his statement that the BCCI general meeting was called a 'khap Panchayat', the special meeting of suspended IPL commissioner Mahitud Abdi today said that his statement was twisted and presented to the board as 'dwarf' ' was not
 abdi ne kaha ki media ne unke bayaan ko galat tareeke se pesh kiya
 He also said that this is his personal opinion and Modi has nothing to do with it
 unhone ek bayaan main kaha ,‘‘ mere kal ke bayaan ko media ke ek halake ne galat tareeke se pesh kiya jisamen maine ‘khap panchayat’ shabd kaa prayog kiya tha
 This was my personal opinion, not a statement issued by Lalit Modi
 ’’ abdi ne kaha,‘‘ maine yah tippanee en shrinivasana : board sachiv : ke taur tareekon ko dekhakar kii thi 
 '' jab narendra modi ne bharat ke agle pradhanmantri ke liye apni daavedaari pesh kii to unhen is hakeekat kaa andaja nahin tha ki ek adad topi unke daawey ko kamjor kar degi
 The much-talked-about 'topi incident' is a unique example of spontaneity during a deliberately organized Sadbhavana fast in Ahmedabad, when the Gujarat Chief Minister has said, 'keep me away from this honor', Maulana Hazrat Sufi Imam Shahi Syed Mehndi refused to wear an Islamic hat offered by Hussain
 narendra modi kaa anshan mahaj ek tamaasha |photogujrat ke musalamaanon or bharat kii aam janata tak pahunch banane ke liye aatur ek netaa ke liye camaron main kaid us kshan kaa vyapak arth he, khaskar isliye ki desh main jatigat vividhta ko darshane ke liye vibhinn prakaar kii rangeen pagadiyaan pahanane ke liye modi tatpar dikhte hai
 Who will be the prime minister in Nitish and Modi? This administrator, the most popular of India's states, chose the Gandhian shortcut as a three-day goodwill fast to announce the political acceptability required by a national leader and his claim to the post of prime minister in 2014 
 vahaan bhaajapa ke diggajon kii qatari, jisamen sab modi jitne hi mahatvakankshi hai par jinka kad utana bada nahin he, pramukh daavedaar ke rup main badhate unke dabadabe kaa sanket thi
 But when this drama was deflected, did Modi just appear to be acting more than just as an impatient player? Interview: Only one who has vested interests opposes: Modiyah question became mandatory because he declared himself a saint in Ahmedabad The idea of doing it was the exact opposite of the silence prevailing in Patna
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or modi ke bich dhun ke maamle main ek hi samya haih donon vikaas ke alambardaar hai
 When Modi tries to capitalize on his own myth in the form of Sardar Patel of the 21st century who is entitled to cover a larger area than Gujarat, Nitish silently waits his turn patiently with confidence
 intervyuu: bihar ke liye kaam karke main khush hum: nitishajab modi akhabaaron ke pehle panne par or televijan ke prime time main chhaakar bhaajapa main apane sahyogiyon or rajg main apane saajheedaaron ko aatankit karte hai tab nitish patna main khamoshi odh lete hai or jaruri bayaan dene se bhi inkaar kar dete hai
 If the clamor in Ahmedabad was causing division, then the silence in Patna was reassuring
 jab sho khatm hua or modi ne nibu pani grahan kar liya to unke or pradhanmantri pad kii unki mamahatvakanksha ke bich ek shaks aa khadaa hua-nitish kumaar
 What is the point in Modi, the undeniably most popular leader of the right, who has remained the center of polarization despite his laudable achievement of reducing communal divide in Gujarat after 2002? After all, why do they still remain scary people struggling to get acceptance beyond Gujarat? Even in surveys of India Today and other publications, Modi continues to lead as India's best Chief Minister and the best possible Prime Minister in non-upa, but he still cannot get rid of the image-changing project: he is constantly trying

 But even before the session starts, the opposition parties Aam Aadmi Party and akali-bjp alliance have decided that there are many issues like debt waiver of farmers, farmer suicides, attacks on Dalits which will surround the Congress government of Punjab

 Sukhbir Badal made it clear that the upcoming assembly session is not going to be easy for Captain Sarkar and the Akali Dal will leave no stone unturned to take on the Congress government during this session
 kisaan mudde par ghiregi captain sarkaaravidhansabha satr main sabase bada mudda rahegaa kisaanon ke karj maafee kaa
 The Punjab farmers' delegation met Punjab Governor VP Badnaur on Tuesday and gave a memorandum telling them how the Congress had promised loan waiver to the farmers before coming to power but now after coming to power, Congress She is forgetting the promises
 punjab ke kisaanon ne saaf kar diya ki agar aane vaale dinon main or 20 june ko hone vaale bajet satr ke dauraan kisaanon ke karj maafee ko lekar punjab sarkaar ne koi bada elaan nahin kiya to phir puure punjab main andolan khadaa kar diya jayega
 Also, farmers of Punjab will also participate in the Satyagraha of farmers to be held on 15 June at Jantar Mantar in Delhi

 Overall, the difficulties of the Punjab government in Punjab are going to increase immensely in the session of the Punjab Assembly starting on Wednesday
 jahaan ek ore sadan ke andar unhen vipakshi partiyon aam aadmi party or akali-bijepi gathbandhan ke hamalon ko jhelana hoga to vahiin sadak par kisaanon ke gusse kaa saamana bhi unhen karnaa hoga
 On Gill's tribute, politics has started in the session of the Punjab Assembly on Wednesday, with the former DGP of Punjab, late KPS Gill
 akali dal ne punjab ke siem captain amarinder singh ko chitthee likhakar vidhansabha ke andar buudhvaar ko kaarywahi shuru hone se pehle di jane vaali shradhanjaliyon main capies gil ko shradhanjali naa dene kii maang kii he
 In the Akali Dal core committee meeting, it was decided not to pay tribute to the late IPS KPS Gill during the Punjab assembly session starting on Wednesday
 punjab ke siem captain amarinder singh ko bhi akali dal kii taraf se chitthee likhakar ye maang kii gai ki capies gil ko sadan ke andar shradhanjali naa dene di jaae
 The Akali Dal believes that KPS Gill falsely killed many innocent Sikhs during the period of terrorism and killed them as terrorists
 isi vajah se akali dal nahin chahta ki capies gil ko punjab vidhansabha ke andar shradhanjali di jaae
 The Punjab government has rejected the Akali Dal's request not to pay tribute to the late IPS KPS Gill in the Punjab Legislative Assembly
 punjab ke vitt mantri manpreet badal ne kaha ki capies gil ne punjab main aatankwaad ke khilaaf kaaphi kaam kiya he or unki vajah se aaj punjab main aman shanti kaayam he or congress sarkaar akali dal kii baat se ittefaq nahin rakhti or vidhansabha satr shuru hone se pehle di jane vaali shradhanjaliyon main capies gil ko bhi shradhanjali jarur di jaaegi
 The Punjab Assembly is expected to be in a ruckus before the session and another controversy has also arisen over the matter of paying tribute to the AKPS Gilco, which is expected to create a huge uproar in the Punjab Assembly
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne abhinetri or bijepi saansad hema malini kii jeevani 'biond da dreamgirl' main ek choti si prastaavna likhi he
 This book by former Stardust editor and producer Ram Kamal Mukherjee will launch on 16 October on Hema Malini's 69th birthday
 is din bhartiya cinema main hema malini ke 50 saal bhi puure ho jaaenge
 Producer Ram Kamal Mukherjee said that our Prime Minister has written very briefly in the book about his feelings for Hema Malini
 yah ek lekhak ke rup main mere liye or hema ji ke liye bhi bahut garv kii baat he or shaayad pehali baar kisi padasth pradhanmantri ne ek bollywood kalakaar par aadhaarit kitaab ke liye prastaavna likhi he
 Let me tell you that Hema Malini campaigned in the Lok Sabha elections for BJP candidate in Gurdaspur, Punjab in the year 1999
 vah abhi mathura nirvachan kshetra sebijapi kii saansdahain
 Mukherjee said that i understand that it was because of Hema ji's goodwill and contribution to art and cinema that Modi ji agreed to write the preface
 jab main unke karyaalay se baat kar rahaa tha, tab vah yah jaanakar kaaphi khush the ki hema ji ne kitaab main apni baat ko sirf bollywood tak hi simit nahin rakhaa he
 From personal life to political life, this book written on Jikhema Malini is divided into 23 chapters
 isamen unke bachapan, kishoravastha, bollywood, abhinetri ke rup main unka udai, prem, sah-kalakaaron, baile nrity, ek nirdeshak ke rup main film 'dil aashna he' main shahrukh khan ko launch karnaa, unke rajnatik jivan or aadhyatmik yatra ko darshaya gaya he
 The book also has two chapters about his two daughters Aisha and Ahana
 mukherjee kaha ki unhone agra main hui durghatana or ek gayika ke rup main apane kariyar ke bare main bhi baat kii he
 We have written them all in a chapter called 'bliss'
 is kitaab main hema ji ke parivaar ke bare main bhi bataaya gaya he, jinke bare main pehle kabhi kuch prakashit nahin kiya gaya
 The book will contain many photographs related to Hema Malini's personal, professional and political life
 is tarah prastaavna likhane ke liye raji hue piem modiyah puche jane par ki aapane modi ko prastaavna likhane ke liye raji kaise kiya, mukherjee ne kaha ki do saal pehle jab maine yah kitaab likhni shuru kii thi tab mere man main yah khyaal nahin aayaa tha
 i was looking for someone else to write the preface
 jab maine hema se modi ji ke bare baat kii tab unhone kaha ki aapkaa dimag kharaab ho gaya he? jab maine unase kaha ki koshish karne main koi buraai nahin he to vah raji ho gayi
 She further said that i think Modi ji loves her (hema) tendency towards classical dance and music and the way she promotes it on the international stage
 meraa maananaa he ki hema malini hone ke alaava ye gun unki (hema malini) khaasiyat he or jahaan tak mujhe lagata he ki yah kitaab ke sheershak ke liye bhi nyaaysangat he

 He said that issues like mob lynching, homecoming, did not happen five years ago

 Significantly, even though PM Modi is presenting the pink economic picture of the country in front of the world, but at the domestic level, he has to deal with questions like employment generation and lack of standard of living
 isliye tarakkee or rojgaar ke sawaalon par baat karte samay piem modi ne koshish kii ki duniya bharat ko ek prabhavi raashtra ke rup main dekhe jisaki badalte vaishvik jagat main ek bhoomika he
 PM Modi once again discussed the successes of digitization, GST, demonetisation, FDIN policy from the platform of Davos
 unhone bataaya ki desh main kis tarah se aarthik sudhaaron ke dwaara tarakkee ko tej kiya gaya he or sudhaar, pradarshan tathaa badlaav ke mantra se desh aage bad rahaa he
 He started his speech by building a partnership world and emphasized the challenges facing humanity
 unhone apane bhaashan main kaaphi samay jalwaayu parirvatan jaise vishyon ko diya
 He spoke of India's rich economic heritage and emphasized Mahatma Gandhi's statement that 'nature is sufficient for your needs, but not for your greed'
 ' isliye manushya ko prakruti ke saath sashastitv banane kii jarurat he
 He stressed India's role in global peace along with coexistence
 idhar desh main bad rahihinsa or ghrinako lekar unki sarkaar ko aalochana jhelana pad rahaa he, lekin is manch par modi ne jor diya ki duniya ko 'daraar' or 'hinsa' dur karne ke liye kaam karnaa chahie
 Through the message of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, Modi tried to explain that our country does not advocate violence and we consider the whole world as one family
 ham to ped-paudhon or jaanwaron ko bhi nuksaan nahin pahunchaate
 It is also a matter of happiness for his supporters that Modi ji has given a strong message to the double standards countries talking about 'good terrorists' and 'bad terrorists' from the platform of Davos
 asal main ab aam chunaav main zyada samay nahin he, jisko dekhte hue piem modi duniya ke har manch kaa istemaal desh ke logon ko apana 'vijan' samajhane kii koshish karenge

 In an interview, Rahul Gandhi said that the debt waiver scheme of farmers in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh is a reflection of the change in the Indian economy model
 unhone kaha ki maujuuda vakt main narendra modi sarkaar ne jo iconomi model apanaaya he, vah 2012 aate-aate flop ho gaya tha

 usee model ko 2004 main kuch badlaav ke saath istemaal kiya gaya, or us samay bhi desh ko phayda hua
 But this model stopped running in 2012 at all
 rahul gandhi ne kaha, 'jo iconomi model 2012 main chalanaa band gaya, jo model 2012 tak pahunchate-pahunchate bilkul flop ho gaya
 But the tragedy of Narendra Modi was that he picked up the same model, which was not fit to run at all
 'unhone kaha, 'manmohan singh ji or hamane sweekaar kiya ki jo model 2004 main or 2009 main chalaa, wo 2012 main bilkul chalane laayak nahin tha
 When we talked to Manmohanji on this issue himself, he told that time that this model is not going to run and it needs to be changed
 lekin narendra modi ne usee model ko aage badha diya, jiskaa parinaam aaj saamne he
 The Congress president clearly said that to bridge the gap between the poor and the rich in the country, now a new model will have to be brought
