 ek tex ke mahatvakanshi lakshya ke saath shuru hue jiesti ko lagu hue ek maheenaa ho gaya he
 There are many questions and doubts in the minds of people before and after the implementation of GST, the country's biggest tax reform
 isi bich shikaayatein aa rahi hai ki jiesti ke naam par kisi utpaada par agar aapse emarpy se zyada paise liye ja rahe hai to ye saraasar galat he
 After GST is implemented, it is wrong for consumers to charge more than the MRP of a product
 emarpy main jiesti judaa hua hai isiilie graahak ko emarpy ke upar koi paisa dene kii zarurat nahi hai
 But if the shopkeeper is charging you a few rupees in the name of GST even after MRP, then be cautious as it is against consumer rights
 upabhokta maamalon ke mantralay ke mutabik emarpy main jiesti laga hua hai isiilie usase zyada daam main koi chiz aapako nahin bechi ja sakati
 Apart from this, if the MRP of a product is increasing under GST, then the company will have to inform it through an advertisement in the newspaper and also stick the new MRP on the product with the old sticker
 in sab badlaavon ke liye mantralay ne treders ko 60 din kaa vakt diya he
 According to the GST expert, many shopkeepers are deliberately charging MRP in the name of GST and people are also giving inadvertent money
 lekin ye baat ekadam saaf hai ki koi bhi emarpy ke upar koi doosraa tex nahin laga saktaa
 If you receive any such bill, then you can complain to it through the helpline number of the central government

 Padmashri Dr

 K
 agarwal ne kaha, bhartiya log munh kii swatchta ke mahatv ke bare main aksar anjaan hote hai
 Poor dental health can lead to many related complications including heart diseases
 aaj ke bachche apane aswasthkar food pattern ke kaaran dantakshay jaisi samasyaon se grast hai
 He said, only calorie foods such as biscuits, chocolate, and other processed foods contain both sugar and salt
 yah munh kii samasyaon kaa kaaran ban saktaa he or antat: bahut hi kam umr main daanton or masuudhon kii samasyaon ko janm de saktaa he
 Dr
 agarwal ne kaha ki munh main bacteria bekaar utpaadon (yaa acid) ko utpann karte hai jo daanton main chote chhidr kar dete hai
 This is the first stage of dentistry
 sahi samay par iskaa ilaaj karvaa lenaa chahie, anyathaa acid daanton main pravesh karke unhen andar se nasht kar detaa he
 He further said, parents should instill healthy habits in children in the beginning
 ve junk food or processd bhojan se bachate hue or jivan style main kuch badlaavon kaa abhyaas karke bacchon ke liye ek adarsh model ban sakate hai

 * har din flos karen, kyonki yah un hisson ko saaf karne main madad karata he, jahaan brush nahin pahunch saktaa he
 * Avoid sugary and starchy foods, as the sugar present in such foods reacts with the bacteria in saliva to increase the toothpaste and eliminate enamel acids
 * jeebh bhi bacteria ko ekatra karti he
 Therefore, after brushing the tongue should also be cleaned with a cabbage
 * yadi aapke masoodon main sujan ho jaati he yaa unase khun bahata he to ek danta chikitsak se paraamarsh len
 Do not ignore the pain of teeth and gums
 * har chah maheene main apane daanton kii jaanch karavaaen

 haalanki 202 saansadon ne bill kaa samarthanabhi kiya he
 Jeremy Corbyn, the head of the Labor Party and Leader of the Opposition in Parliament, on Wednesday moved a no-confidence motion against the government
 sabase dilachasp baat yah he ki is bill kii voting main pradhanmantri me ke kai saansad bhi virodh main utar aae
 118 mps from Theresa May's Conservative Party, along with the opposing camp, voted against the bill
 pradhanmantri me ne sansad main apil kii he ki britain kii bhalaai ke liye is bill ko samarthan diya jaae, lekin unki apil kaam nahin ai or saansadon ne bahumat se ise khaarij kar diya
 With the fall of this bill, there has been a streak of concern in the UK as the last date for withdrawal of the European Union from Britain is 29 March and the bill was rejected in January
 haalanki, bill kii miyaad 30 june tak badhaai ja sakati he lekin ise zyada maheenon tak nahin taal sakate kyonki is par dubaara janamat sangrah karana mushkil he
 Theresa May says that the deal they proposed (how to break away from the EU, rules and regulations) is better for the country
 yah saaf nahin he ki agar yah deal khaarij ho jaataa he to phir aage kya hoga
 In the last month, she said that she hopes that people will understand that if she says that this deal is not passed, then there is definitely a possibility of getting into serious problems
 haalanki unhen bharosa he ki aisa nahin hoga
 He said, "the danger of Bregit not happening or leaving the EU without any agreement will mean a lot of uncertainty for the country
 "bich main yah bhi khabaren udi thim ki kuch dinon ke liye bregsit bill par voting ko taala ja saktaa he, lekin aisa nahin hua or sansad main is par matdaan hua
 Parliament votes down Prime Minister May's EU divorce deal by 230 votes, with a 'no confidence vote' set for tomorrow

 november main britain ne bregsit deal par sahmati jataai thi, lekin ise sansad se paas hona abhi baaki he
 The Prime Minister has warned mps that if this bill is not passed on time, the whole country may be in trouble
 me kaa ishaara is ore bhi tha ki sambhav he britain ko nae chunaav ke liye utarana pade
 However, the mps did not worry about his concern and voted against the bill
 purv pradhanmantri davit camran bhi theresa me kii tarah bregsit bill kaa samarthan kar chuke hai
 They believe that the country will leave the European Union and join the single market
 philhal britain kaa puraa bazaar or arthvyavastha europe ke saath judaa he
 This means that the effect of the economy of other countries of Europe is also reflected in Britain

 The last time the power couples of Bollywood celebrated their daughter's birthday with much fanfare, but Inaya's birthday will be celebrated in peace

 Soha Ali Khan told in an interview, "we celebrated Inaya's first birthday with great pomp
" agar ham is baar bhi inaaya kaa janmdin usee tarah manaate hai to isse use koi fark nahin padegaa
 i think we should celebrate Jorshor's fifth, 11th, 25th birthday
 iske baad hansate hue soha boleen, mujhe yakeen he ki mujhe uske 25wein janmdin par aamantrit nahin kiya jayega
 When Soha was asked about Inaya's birthday party, she said, this time there can be a small celebration at home
 soha ali khan or kunal khemu ne pichhali baar inaaya ke janmdin par pool party yojit kii thi
 Soha and Kunal called their friends at the party
 jaisaa ki ab soha ne saaf kar diya he ki is baar inaaya ke janmdin ko bilkul shant tareeke se manaaya jayega
 Anyway, Bollywood's power couples keep a distance from the media and avoid sharing any plan first

 aapane girls tok ke bare main suna hoga
 The same things that girls do to each other in a slow voice
 ye wo baaten hoti hai jo ek ladki, sirf duusari ladki se hi karti he
 a recent study has also proved that there are some things that a girl likes to do only with another girl
 adhyayan ke mutabik, zyaadaatar ladkiyaan antarang sambandhon ke bare main sirf or sirf apni saheli se hi baat karnaa pasand karti hai
 Apart from Saheli, she also talks to her partner on this subject
 agar koi ladki apane purush saathi ko dhokhaa de rahi hoti he to bhi wo ye baat apni saheli se share karti he
 About 33 percent of women tell their friend about their deception while only 5 percent of women share this secret with their partner
 adhyayan ke anusaar, ek-tihaai mahilaayein apni saheliyon se apane partner ke bare main baat karnaa pasand karti hai
 Apart from this, if she is with more than one man, then she also tells this to her friend
 38 pratishat mahilaayein apni sex life ke bare main apni dost ko bataati hai
 While one-quarter of women do something exciting, they tell their friend about it
 vimens intimet health brands balance active dwaara karaae gaye is adhyayan main kaha gaya he prem sambandhon or shaareerik sambandhon ko lekar jo baaten mahilaayein apane partner yaa bwoyfriend tak ko nahin bataati wo baaten ve apni saheli se share karnaa pasand karti hai
 However, despite sharing everything, most women prefer to talk less about sexual health
 is maamle main ve apni saheliyon ko bhi andekha kar detii hai
 One in five women talk to their friend about their sexual health
 adhyayan main kaha gaya he partner se yaa phir bwoyfriend se aisi baaten chhipaane kaa sabase mahatvapurn kaaran ye he ki mahilaon ko dar hota he ki unke saath unase naaraaz ho jaaenge
 Controversial rhetoric has once again been seen on social media between the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party
 congress kii soshal media pramukh divya spandana ne bollywood actress raakhi saavant kaa ek purana video twitor par share kiya he, jis par dilli bijepi ke pravaktaa tejinder bagga ne unheen ke andaaj main javaabi video share kiya he
 Divya Spandana has commented on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, sharing videos of Nerakhi Sawant
 jisamen unhone likhaa he ki 'modi ji aapkaa damaad mil gaya he
 In fact, in the video which has been shared, Rakhi Sawant is sitting in a car
 unke bagal vaali seat par ek doosraa shaks baitha hua he
 In the video, Rakhi Sawant is saying that i could not find any boy in India, due to which he had to find a boy in New York
 itnaa hi nahin, wo piem modi kii tarif karte hue ye bhi kah rahi hai ki unhen (piem modi) damaad mil gaya he
 While sharing this video with the tweet, Divya Spandana has quipped
 jisamen unhone piem modi or raakhi saavant ko bhi tag kiya tha
 This tweet by Divya was also reversed by the BJP and the party's Delhi unit spokesperson Tejinder Pal Bagga also responded with the video

 varsh 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ko 122, shivasena ko 63, congress ko 42 or rakanpa ko 41 siten mili thi
 BJP and Shiv Sena contested separate elections in that election
 haalanki, baad main shivasena bhaajapa ke netritv vaali sarkaar main shaamil ho gai thi
 Former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan said that with the results an 'interesting possibility' of forming the next government in Maharashtra has also emerged
 lekin kya congress-rakanpa, shivasena se gathbandhan karegi, is par rukh spasht nahin kiya
 He described the party as less harmful than the BJP
 varsh 2014 ke mukaable is chunaav main sharad pavaar kii party rakanpa kii siton main sabase adhik vruddhi hui he jabaki bhaajapa ke siton main khaasi kami ai he
 However, this did not dampen the enthusiasm of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Chavan said that the bjp-shiv Sena alliance would rule again for the next five years
 udhar shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne bete aditya thakare ke jeet kar aane par bhaajapa ko uske vaade yaad dilaae jise abhi tak puraa nahin kiya gaya
 Encouraged by the question of journalists as to which party would get the chief minister's chair, Uddhav said, "this is the time to remind the BJP of the formula BJP President Amit Shah promised to come to my house
" 
 
 yah formula 50-50 kaa tha
 He said, "we had agreed to fight in fewer seats than BJP but cannot accommodate BJP every time
" mujhe party ko phalne-phoolne dena hoga
 Devendra Fadnavis said that despite winning fewer seats than in 2014, the win ratio of the candidates is better
 unhone spasht evam nirnaayak janadesh dene ke liye maharashtra ke logon kaa dhanyavad kiya
 With this, the Chief Minister said that the BJP will go ahead with the formula set earlier with the Shiv Sena
 is chunaav main jin pramukh netaaon ko jeet mili he unamem fadanvis or aditya thakare ke alaava vidhaan parishad main netaa pratipaksh dhananjay munde, purv mukhyamantri evam congress netaa ashok chavaan evam prithviraj chavaan, purv upmukhyamantri ajit pavaar shaamil hai
 However, six ministers in the Fadnavis government have lost
 chunaav se thik pehle shivasena main shaamil hue 11 netaaon or bhaajapa main shaamil hue aath netaaon ko bhi haar mili he

 It was believed that this time the batsmen will be dominated in the World Cup but the matches so far could not be proved
 aise main jabaki bumraah ne yah kah diya ki aane vaale samay main wicket dhime ho jaaenge to pratispardhaa or rochak ho gai he
 Team India's fast bowler Bumrah admits that wickets have been much slower now than the start of the tournament and scoring has not been easy
 bumraah ne udhaaharan ke taur par bharat or srilanka ke bich hue bharat ke antim lig match ke bare main kaha ki yah wicket utani dhimi nahin hui, jitna bhartiya think tanks samaj rahaa tha
 Bumrah said, 'any batsman can score runs on any day
 iske liye ballebaaj ko shrey diya janaa chahie lekin kul milakar alam yah he ki wicket dhimi ho gaye hai
 Bumrah said that the Indian bowling attack is ready to discharge its responsibilities even on a slow pitch
 bakaul bumraah, 'har koi jimmedaari le rahaa he or apane str par purajor prayaas kar rahaa he
 We are happy that everyone is contributing

 In fact, Team India captain Virat Kohli on Tuesday alleged that after the end of the Bangalore Test, the Australian players took the help of the support staff sitting in the dressing room to watch DRS multiple times during the match, which kept an eye on the laptop and TV
 Had happened

 The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court's decision of 30 September 2010 is itself a legal and moral contradiction
 ram janmabhumi-babari masjid vivaad main supreme court donon pakshon kii aapattiyon ko usee faisle ke aadhaar par sun rahaa he
 In many respects, it was a historic decision, yet the High Court ruling was strangely silent on some of the issues that were essential to the basic principle of justice, especially the incident of December 6, 1992
 faisla yah nahin kah paaya ki babari masjid ko giraaya janaa ek gaiyrkanoonee kaam tha
 He did not even identify the collective hooliganism of the karsevaks, who dumped the mosque in the mud
 usne us aparaadh ke peediton or masjid ko giraae jane ke baad deshbhar main hue sampradayik dangon main maare gaye takreeban 2,000 logon kii jaanon kii kshatipurti tak ke bare main kuch nahin kaha
 He also blamed the leadership and legal officials of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement for failing to protect the mosque, while all of them in the Supreme Court guaranteed that they would protect the law
 phir bhi do virdohi samudaayon ke bich malikana haq ke daawey se nibatane ke maamle main dekha jaae to hycourt kii teen jajon kii khanthpeetha ne ek aitihaasik faisla diya
 He said that 2 in Ayodhya
 77 acre kii vivaadit jameen ko teen baraabar hisson main baant diya jaae—ram mandir ke nirmaan ke liye ramalala virajman, jinka pratinidhitiv hindu mahasabha kar rahi thi, sunni vakf board auki nirmohi akhaade ke bich
 The court probably based its decision on historical details that said that Hindus and Muslims had been worshiping together at the place between which the colonial rule of the British later laid the wall
 viraasat ke vaazib bantwaare ke siddhanton par chalate hue court ne faisla diya ki samoochee sampatti ko musalamaanon or hinduon ke samuhik swaamitv vaala samajha jaae or use bharat ke praasangik sampatti kanoonon ke tahat nishpakshta ke saath vaadi pakshon ke bich baant diya jaae
 The court's decision to hand over the center of the dome in the mosque, which housed the idol of Ramlala, to Hindus (hindu Mahasabha) has been criticized
 lekin hakeekat yahi he ki faisla kuch bhi hota to kisi na kisi ek pakshakaar ke hit main jaataa dikhaai detaa
 In a democracy, the court may have given the verdict in favor of the majority community even with a clear view to minimize the fear of bloodshed on the streets
 haalanki teen jajon kii peeth is baat par ekamat nahin thi ki vivaadit dhaancha kisi mandir ko giraakar banaaya gaya tha, vah is baat par sahamat thi ki mandir yaa kisi mandir kaa dhaancha usee jagah par masjid se pehle bana tha
 The Court of Archaeological Survey of India used a lot of excavation as evidence, according to which the earlier structure there was of a huge Hindu temple

 Both these budgets are very important for the government
 aagaamee bajtse pehle kendra sarkaar ke notebandi ke faisle se demand ko karaara jhatka laga he vahiin industry kii taraf se arthvyavastha main nivesh rukaa hua he
 Therefore, in the upcoming budget, the central government will try to increase jobs in the country by investing on infrastructure

 So now his challenge should be how soon he can check the bank accounts and find out what and how much the government has benefited from this exercise to curb black money in the economy
 sunil alagh kaa daawa tha ki notebandi se agle 2-3 saal tak desh main bhrashtachar nahin rahegaa
 Therefore, to maintain it even further, it is necessary to continue the ban on withdrawal of large sums of money from banks

 This is quite complicated

 If we are serious about this, it is not a bill

 It is interesting to me that only one party is talking about the system

 They are not talking about mechanisms to fight corruption

 She was not allowed to pass

 The past cannot be changed, but on the next floor is the next year's T20 World Cup and if it wins, it will strengthen the team of Virat Kohli, the captain of the invincible, but before that the question is Will former team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni fly to Australia? The coach said that everyone should wait for the IPL for this

 jab kabhi metro yaa railway stesan par khadey hote hai to train aane se pehle anounsament hota he ki plateform ke kinare par na khadey rahen
 Also, it is instructed that the platform should cross through the tracks sometime
 iske baad kai log in galatiyon ko doharaate hai or haadase ke shikaar ho jate hai
 a video of such negligence of the passenger at the railway station of China is going viral on social media
 yah video dil dahala dene vaala he
 It is also going to be a lesson to those who cross platforms through tracks instead of footover bridges
 is video main dikhaaya gaya he ki ek vyakti daudkar patari paar karne kii koshish kar rahaa hota he
 Due to the height of the platform, the train arrives before it can climb

 After the announcement of dates in the upcoming assembly elections, the biggest challenge for the BJP and the Congress is ticket distribution and control of rebels
 chhattisgarh ke liye bijepi ne 77 siton ke liye ummidavaar ghoshit kar die hai, jisamen 14 vidhayakon ke tikat kate hai
 At the same time, it is also news that to reduce the anti-incumbency wave, BJP may cut tickets of mlas on a large scale this time
 namo ap se sidhe piem tak pahunch rahaa feedbakadrasal, bijepi is ranneeti ke jariye anya rajyon ke netaaon or loksabhaa saansadon ko ek sandesh bhi dena chaahati he ki yadi unka feedback thik nahin rahaa to aagaamee chunaavon main kaam ke aadhaar par unke upar bhi gaaj gir sakati he
 Recall Madhya Pradesh worker Mahakumbh party president told the workers that your biggest weapon is the Namo app through which you are directly connected to the PM
 bijepi sutron ke mutabik paaramparik madhyam se feedback ke alaava is baar namo ap ke jariye bhi feedback liya ja rahaa he
 The use of the Namo app is giving feedback directly to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the performance of the general public and party's grassroots workers
 jaahir he tikat vitaran se pehle namo ap bijepi ke ranneetikaron ke liye kargar hathiyaar sabit hoga
 Madhya Pradesh can cut 70-80 mlas, the ticket-holder BJP has 165 mlas in the 230 member assembly of Madhya Pradesh
 aise main khabar aa rahi he ki bijepi inamen se lagbhag aadha yani 70-80 vidhayakon ke tikat kaatane par gambhirtha se vichaar kar rahi he, jinamein se kuch mantri bhi shaamil hai
 a BJP leader has said on condition of anonymity that there is public anger against some leaders, due to which the party high command can take this decision
 bijepi sutron ke mutabik mukhyamantrishivraj singh chouhanaki jan aashirwad yatra ke dauraan unhen kaam na karne vaale kuch netaaon ke bare main shikaayatein bhi mili hai
 In such a situation, the BJP believes that the seats on which there is public outrage against their leaders, those seats should be landed with new faces
 gauratlab he ki 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne 25 fisadi siton par nae chehron ko tarjeeh di thi jisamen se 75 fisadi ummidavaaron ne jeet darj kii
 Obviously the party wants to try this strike rate again
 lekin is baar inaki sankhya main ijapha ho saktaa he
 Ticketkamovesh can be cut in a big way in Rajasthan also, this condition is also in Rajasthan BJP
 200 sadasyeey rajasthan main bijepi ke 163 vidhayak hai
 Recently in an internal survey of BJP, seats were divided into three categories
 is survey ke mutabik rajasthan kii 137 seat vidhansabha siton ko b or c kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya he
 It is being said that in most of these seats, new faces can be given tickets
 chaunkaane vaali baat he ki mantriparishad ke adhikansh sadasyon ke kshetra bhi is danger jone main he
 Let us tell you that in the 2013 assembly elections, BJP gave new faces to 125 seats, in which 95 percent of the faces were successful
 jaahir he is baar bhi party tikat vitaran ke dauraan is strike rate ko nazarandaaj nahin kar sakati
 In Rajasthan, BJP in-charge and Union Minister Prakash Javadekar had said in an interview to an English newspaper that this time the ticket distribution would be quite shocking and the party would be helped by the cutting of tickets by the sitting mlas
 congress ke pradesh adhyaksh sachin payalat ne pichley dinon chunaav samiti kii baithak ke baad press vaarta main kaha tha ki jab bijepi ko apane vidhayakon par bharosa nahin to janata inaki sarkaar par kya bharosa karegi
 There are also changing caste equations because the traditional vote banks of the Brahmins and Kshatriyas of the BJP in Rajasthan are seen moving away from the BJP
 bijepi ke bade netaa ghanashyam tiwadi ne party se alag hokar bharat vahini party banaai he jiskaa jat netaa hanuman beniwal se gathbandhan tay mana ja rahaa he
 At the same time, the Jasol family of Barmer, a big Rajput family from Jodhpur division, joined Congress
 gurjaron kii naaraazgi kii bharpai karne ke liye bijepi ne gurjaron ke pratidwandi meenaon ke bade netaa kirodi laal meena ko apane kheme main kar liya he
 At the same time, there is resentment among the Dalits also about the party
 madhya pradesh main bhi halaat kamovesh aise hi hai
 In opposition to the SC / ST Act, the General, Backward and Minority Class Officers Employees Association (SPX) has announced to field candidates in all seats
 gyaat ho ki savarna bijepi kaa paaramparik vot he, lekin essi / asti act ko lekar sarkaar ke rukh se naaraaz bhi hai
 Recently, the maximum impact of the upper caste movement was seen in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan
 baagiyon se kaise niptenge?aise halaat main yadi maujuuda vidhayakon ke tikat katate hai to kai siton par bijepi ko baagiyon se nipatane main bhi kaaphi mashkkat kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Because those parties which do not have mass base and leaders, they are sitting in the same direction that the game of both should be spoiled by giving tickets to two big parties BJP or Congress rebels
 kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh ne aaj jor dekar kaha ki bharat sabhi deshon ke saath achche sambandh chahta he par ise uski kamajori nahin samajhnaa chahie
 The Home Minister said that the security forces have been given clear instructions to give a 'befitting reply' in the event of ceasefire violation by Pakistan
 niyantran rekha paar se firing kii haalia ghatnaon kii taraf ishaara karte hue grahamantri ne kaha ki unhone biguef ko nirdesh diya he ki agar pakistan sangharshaviram ulanghan jari rakhe to 'safed jhande na dikhaate rahen

 ' The Home Minister said that the BSF DG had told him that 'we have shown white flags on 15 occasions but Pakistan is firing repeatedly
 ' unhone kaha, 'maine biguef ke diji se kaha ki agar pakistan apni harkaton se baj nahin aata or ulanghan jari rakhata he to (biesaf ke javaanon ko) saaf aadesh den ki agali baar safed jhande nahin dikhaae jaaenge balki (bharat kii taraf se) firing shuru kii jaaegi
 ' rajnath singh ne kaha ki congress ke pichley 10 saal ke shasankaal main na keval bharat main, balki puri duniya main, ek dharna bani ki ham ek kamjor desh hai
 He said, "but after the formation of the Modi government, the world has changed perception

 lekhak ne khand ek ke 3 se lekar 6 bhaagon main un mudon ko vistaar or tarkpurna dhang se pesh kiya he, jinako aadhaar banaakar centre kii modi sarkaar ko nishane par liya gaya
 The author has exposed the truth or conspiracy behind serious issues like intolerance, cow slaughter, triple talaq, Ram temple issue and JNU scandal

 Not only this, there is also communication of self-respect among Indians settled abroad

 Modi's economic policy has also been discussed in section two
 jisamen aam aadmi ke vikaas ke liye sarkaar dwaara uthaaye gayi yojanaon or nitiyon kii charchaa he
 In the third section of the book, the author has spoken about the public support, due to which BJP has managed to form the government with absolute majority not only in the center, but also in those states where BJP was not there before
 
 2014 se hi modi kaal kaa udai hua
 During this period, BJP not only increased the vote percentage but also increased their popularity in every state
 lekhak kaa nishkarsh he ki modi kii aarthik nitiyon se aam aadmi ko laabh hua he, aam aadmi ko vishwaas he ki modi se aam aadmi, jo ab tak vanchit or pinda hua rahaa kii bhalaai ke liye kaam karnaa chaahate hai

 On hearing the word Holashtak, the call of Holi wakes up in the mind
 ji haa, holi se aath din pehle phalgun maheene kii shukla paksh kii ashtami tithi se holashtak kii shuruyaat ho jaati he
 This year Holashtak will start from March 5 to March 12
 kya he holashtakaolashtak ko samajhane ke liye pehle iske shabdic arth ko samajhate hai
 Holashtak is a word consisting of Hola and Ashtak
 hola kaa arth holi se he or ashtak yani aath din
 In simple words, 8 days before Holi are called Holashtak
 holashtak shuru hote hi log holi kii taiyaari shuru kar dete hai
 For Holika worship 8 days before Holi, the place where Holika is to be burnt, the place of Holi is purified by purifying it with Ganga water and the dry wood, dumplings are collected and deposited in the same place every day
 On the day of Holika Dahan, a large pile could gather
 kyon ashubh mana jaataa he holashtakdharm granthon main holashtak ke 8 din mangalik kaaryon ke liye ashubh maane jate hai
 There are many beliefs behind this
 aisa mana jaataa he ki bhagwaan shiv kii tapasya bhang karne kii koshish karne par bholenath se kaamdev ko phalgun maheene kii ashtami ko bhasma kar diya tha
 As soon as the god of love, Kamadeva, was consumed, a wave of grief spread throughout the world
 tab kaamdev kii patni rati ne shivaji se kshamaa yachana kii or bholenath ne kaamdev ko phir se jivit karne kaa aashwaasan diya
 After this, people were happy playing the colors
 kuch granthon main varnan miltaa he ki holi ke 8 din pehle se prahlada ko uske pita hiranyakashyap ne kaaphi yatnaaen dena shuru kar diya tha
 On the eighth day, an attempt was made to kill Prahlada in the lap of Holika, but Holika was burnt to get the boon of not burning in the fire and the boy Prahlad survived
 ishwar bhakt prahlaad ke yatnaa bhare 8 dinon ko shubh nahin mana jaataa he isliye koi bhi shubh kaam naa karne kii parampara he

 mumbai main ek bas ko agava karne kii koshish kii gai he
 a person with a revolver entered the Best 332 bus near Kurla and tried to abduct the bus
 bas kurlaa se andheri ja rahi thi
 During this, the police fired on the attacker in which he was injured
 hamalavar ne bhi teen round goliyaan chalaai
 The injured attacker was admitted to the hospital where he later died
 bas ke sabhi yatri surakshit hai
 Three passengers suffered minor injuries
 rahul raaj naam ke is yuvak kii umr 23 saal thi or wo patna kaa rahane vaala tha
 He was studying in the X-ray faculty
 rahul ke pita kundan prasad ke mutabik wo naukari kii talash main mumbai gaya tha or patna se wo akelaa hi niklaa tha
 According to the eyewitnesses in the bus, Rahul was repeatedly shouting that he had come to kill Raj Thackeray
 usne ek yatri se mobile phone par police ko soochna dilwaai ki wo uttar bharatiyon par julm dha rahe raaj thakare ko maarane aayaa he or police raaj ko uske paas le aae
 In this bus going from Kurla to Andheri, Rahul climbed up and pointed a pistol at the conductor
 usne yatriyon ko daraaya-dhamkaaya bhi
 The incident took place at half past eight in the morning
 conductor ke mutabik rahul ne bas ko hijank karne kii soochna bhi police ko dilwaai
 Police surrounded the bus and fired five rounds at Rahul
 aspataal pahunchane tak ghayal rahul kii maut ho gai
 In the case of trying to hijack the best bus, many questions are being raised over the police firing
 sabase bada sawaal ye ki ye police kaa encounter tha yaa hatya? bas ko agava karne kii koshish kar rahe rahul ko police pakad bhi sakati thi, lekin police ne use pakadaney kii jagah goli kyon maar di? maukey par police jab pahunchi to bas main rahul akelaa tha
 He was definitely intimidating people, but not harming anyone
 bas khaali thi or usase kisi ko nuksaan bhi nahin hona tha, aise main police ko paanch round firing kii kya jarurat padi
 Was he a serious criminal who the police could not catch? pradhanmantri narendra modine apane vaade ke mutabik diwali ke din bhi chuttee nahin lee or jammu-kashmir ke baadh peediton se mili
 To understand Kashmir, Narendra Modi met different sections of society affected by the terrible floods in Jammu and Kashmir on Diwali
 pramukh raajnneetik dalon ke pratinidhiyon ke saath baatcheet karne ke alawapradhanmantri nephal va kesar utpaadak sangh, hotelkarmiyon, housebort ke maalikon, travel agent, enjio, saamaajik sanghathanon, skulon, transpotor, shikshavidon or vyapaaree nikaayon ke pratinidhimandalon ke saath mulaakaat kii
 He came to know about the situation of the business which was destroyed by the traders
 fal va kesar utpaadak sangh ne baadh main fasal kii tabaahi ke bare main pradhanmantri ko bataaya
 He also said that dealers in Delhi and other parts of the country are not buying the fruit at the right price
 kendriya grih sachiv anil goswami kii ore se jari vijyapti main kaha gaya he, 'unhone seb, kesar or duusari paidaavaar bechney, fasal beemaa, cold storage tathaa cold chen suvidha, paidaavaar ko bazaar tak le jane main sabsidi tathaa bank karj ke pun: bhugtan main sahyog kaa aagrah kiya
 The traders demanded that their insurance claim should be redressed soon and tax relief for 10 years
 isse pehle modi ne baadh peediton ke liye raahat package kii ghoshnaa kii
 a compensation of 570 crores was also announced for the repair of houses damaged in the flood
 uttar pradesh ke kasganj main hui hinsa par gujarat ke dalit netaa jignesh mewaani ne kaha he ki ye ghatana upi police kii naakaami ko darshaati he
 Maintenance of law and order is the responsibility of the state government and administration, but the Yogi government has completely failed in this
 jignesh ne kaha ki tirangaa lekar nikle ABVP or bijepi ke logon ne muslim logon par hamalaa kiya, ye nindaneey he
 Do not draw in the name of the tricolor, he said that no one has a monopoly on the tricolor, be it Hindus or Muslims, everyone has the right to fly the flag
 unhone kaha ki tirangaa to ham logon ne bhi vadgaanv main fahraaya tha lekin hamaarimansha katai galat nahinthi, tirangaa ke naam par kisi samudaay yaa jati vishesh ko nishaanaa bananaa thik nahin he
 On the demand of the martyr's status on behalf of the family of deceased Chandan, Mevani said that he has the right to demand but i am not fully aware of the incident, so it would not be appropriate to say anything on this
 jammu kashmir ke dipti mufti ne bayaan par pratikriya dete hue jignesh ne isi desh main kanoon kaa raaj lagu ho jaae, samvidhan lagu ho jaae yahi kaaphi hoga
 BJP can sign in jail, accusing the government that whoever is raising voice against the government is being targeted
 unhone kaha hardik ho yaa jignesh sabhi konishaanaa banane kii sajishrachi ja rahi he
 He said that a case was registered against me after the speech given in Pune, whereas i did not say anything wrong in that speech
 unhone aarope lagaate hue kaha ki bijepi kahin na kahin 2019 aam chunaav ko lekar hardik or mujhase khatara mahasoos kar rahe hi, yahi vajah he ki hamaare khilaaf maamle darj kar rahe hai, saath hi dar he ki wo mujhe or hardik ko jail main bhi band karvaa sakate hai
 Directed by Shoojit Sircar, the film 'piku' is based on the father-daughter relationship
 amitabh bachchan, deepika padukon or irfan khan starer film ‘piku’ ko logon dwaara kaaphi pasand kiya ja rahaa he
 The story of the film revolves around 'piku' i
e
 Deepika Padukone and her Baba i
e
 Amitabh Bachchan
 lekin yahaan ham baat ‘piku’ kii nahin, pariniti kii kar rahe hai
 Many times it happens that you do not take the right decision and later regret it
 in dinon kuch aisa hi anubhav pariniti chopra ko ho rahaa he
 As the graph of Piku's success is increasing, Parineeti's heartlessness is also increasing
 film ko shandaar rivyuu ke saath-saath darshakon kaa pyaar bhi mil rahaa he
 Actually, director Shoojit Sarkar had offered Piku's role to Parineeti before Deepika, but Parineeti refused Shoojit Sarkar to work in this film
 pariniti us vakt film 'daavat-e-ishk' main mukhya bhoomika kar rahi thim, jo pita-putree kii kahani par aadhaarit thi or unhen puraa vishwaas tha ki yashraj banners kii ye film jarur safal hogi
 Also, Parineeti did not want to do films about father-daughter relationships again
 isliye unhone 'piku' main kaam karne se inkaar kar diya
 This wrong decision of Parineeti proved lucky for Deepika
 lekin ab pariniti ke paas sirf afsos karne ke or kuch nahin bachaa

 It will be asked why the promise made in the manifesto has not been fulfilled

 There is also anger among people

 In such a situation, what are the options before the Modi government of the Center which came to power two and a half years ago with the promise of teaching a strong lesson to terrorism and Pakistan? Should the Pakistan government be negotiated or should Pakistan be attacked? It is important to investigate this
 haalanki in vikalpon ke saath jokhim bhi hai, jinhen nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa

 In June 2015, 18 army personnel were killed in an ambush in Manipur

 Conversation through backdoor: It is clear that in Pakistan, there is the dominance of Kisena over power, in such a situation, the central government also has the option of backdoor dialogue with the Pakistan Army
 lekin pakistani sena kii niyat par andeh he ki wo shanti prakriya main bharat kaa kitna saath degi
