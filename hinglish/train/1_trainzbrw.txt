 ve chaahate hai ki aap bedman kaa tital sang sunen
 Badman is a mockumentary or spoof film in which he is playing his character himself
 yah film, diarector saumik sen ke saath whatsap par unki baatcheet ko lekar he
 You are able to pay attention to the song lyrics, Grover shouts at the team members gathered there, "shut up!" Not that they want silence at all
 vah honi bhi nahin chahie, kyonki yah vaise bhi lunch brake he
 But the eldest person on the set, Grover said it
 har koi unki baat maan letaa he
 After all, he is the senior villain of Bollywood Badman or himself
 or khalanaayak se koi uski umr nahin poochta
 Doing this hurts more than the hero's punch
 yahaan har kisi ko yah baat pataa nahin ki grover kya hai or yah bhi ki ve hollywood main kaam karne vaale shuruaati adaakaaron main se hai
 Unaware of his legacy, Viacom 18 CEO Ajit Andhare also has two daughters
 andhaare bedman main chota-sa role bhi kar rahe hai
 The girls don't want Grover to take a picture with them
 asal main jab ve shooting nahin kar rahe hote hai, yani jab mocumentary ke lamhon ko darj nahin kar rahe hote hai, tab grover yahi sab karte hai
 In his words, "people usually say," Gulshanji, can i take a photo with you? "and here i am saying," Take a photo
 ''vycom18 ke launch kiye gaye digital plateform voot par alok nath or baba sahagal bhi dikhaai denge or aksar khud apni jag hansaai karwaakar logon kaa dil bahlaayenge
 If Grover is seen trying to be the hero and father of children in Badman, Nath is hosting a chat show Cincari on the basis of his popular 'sanskari' avatar in which he will invite celebrities to talk about sex and related issues
 ye sho sabit karte hai ki internet bollywood ke liye zyada bade darshak varg tak pahunch banane kaa aujaar ban gaya he or iske jariye vah yah bhi bataanaa chahta he ki vah khud par hans saktaa he or aaj ke naujavaanon kaa humsafar he
 At the same time, it is also an opportunity for the stars who have entered the age of seventies like Grover to find themselves afresh and make it suitable for the audience who have not grown up watching their films

 While the entire gamut of programming is rooted in advertising revenue and trps, the empty space on the web has become a way for filmmakers to do what they want

 "that is why Shahrukh Khan and Kajol Bhaag agreed to appear in Jeetu Bhaag
" agar actor aane se inkaar karte hai, to unka makhul udaane ko betaab actaron kii koi kami nahin he
 Menon has to say this
 ek saal puraane online channel 'screen pattee'' or haal hi main launch 'are' is badhate hue udyog main shaamil hai
 His motive for lottery becomes easier when Bollywood is also ready to make a mockery
 magar golani kehete hai ki jarurat bollywood ke farmaanon ke aage nahin jhukne or us 'raachanaatmak aazaadee' ko banaae rakhane kii he jo is madhyam ko itnaa badhiya banaati he

 golani ko yakeen he ki bhavishya ke online content ko 'kaaryakramon kii moulikta' se parkhaa jayega
 From Badman, Grover is doing exactly what Internet users like: his attitude of not taking himself seriously
 world wide web grover ko vah mauka de rahaa he jo bollywood ab unhen nahin degaa
 Grover won the hearts of the team members as Badman finished

 ) National Democratic Alliance (NDA) convenor and Janata Dal (united) president Sharad Yadav said that the Central Government should withdraw the decision of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in retail trade or stop the proposal of opposition work and debate it in Parliament
 
 yadav ne jad (you) pradesh mukhyalay par kaha, ‘kendra sarkaar ko chahie ki vah khudara vyapaar main epadiai ke nirnay ko ‘role back’ kare athwa sansad main vipaksh ke kamroko prastaav par charchaa karaae
 The entire opposition is unanimous about this
 ’ unhone kaha ki anna hajaare ke janalokapal vidheyak laane ke liye hue andolan ke dauraan to sarkaar sansad ko sarvocch bataati rahi, lekin jab khudara vyapaar main epadiai kaa mudda aayaa, to usne sansad main nirnay karaane ke bajaae khud ko sarvocch sabit kar diya
 How will this double standard run? sansad ke chalate sarkari str par aise nirnay nahin hone chahie
 The NDA convenor said that the central government will have to bow down in the face of public opinion, as it does not have the required majority in the Lok Sabha on this issue
 unhone kaha ki shanivaar ko meri trinmul congress pramukh mamata benergy se phone par hui baatcheet nitant nijee charchaa thi, lekin pataa nahin kaise vah media main fail gai
 He said that Leader of the Lok Sabha and Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee would make a statement in the House on the FDI issue in retail trade
 ullekhneey he ki mukherjee se baatcheet ke aadhaar par mamata ne kolkata main kaha tha ki khudara vyapaar main epadiai ke nirnay ko nilambit kiya gaya he

 The NDA convenor said that in March last year, on a perusal notice, the government had agreed that we would implement FDI in retail trade by consensus, but it did not implement it
 yah poochne par ki bhaajapa ne to apane chunaav ghoshnaa patr main epadiai kaa samarthan kiya tha, unhone kaha ki desh main chunaav ghoshnaa patr padhata koun he
 Since this matter came, you must have found it and read it from somewhere
 yadav ne kaha ki desh main khudara vyapaar se 25 karod log jude hue hai or multi brands epadiai se ye sabhi berozegaar ho jaaenge
 There is a lack of employment in the country and the retail market is a great source of employment, which is connected to people like shopkeepers, street-to-street vendors doing business
 madhyapradesh main ‘wallmart’ ke chal rahe kuch khudara vyapaar ‘outlet’ ko lekar unhone kaha ki yah ‘single brands outlet’ honge or is par sabaki sahmati he
 He was asked that the BJP government of the state has approved 26 percent FDI in outlets like Walmart, how it is working, so he said that he has asked the people of the Chamber of Commerce to encircle it

 darasal, in dinon ek video viral ho rahaa he, jisamen khud digvijay singh kehete dikh rahe hai ki unke bhaashan congress ko nuksaan pahunchaate hai or isi vajah se vah koi raily yaa jansabha nahin karte
 According to the information, Digvijay Singh had reached the house of Congress working president Jeetu Patwari two days ago and when he got out of there, the Congress workers stood before him
 iske baad digvijay singh ne kaha, "kaam nahin kiya to khwab dekhte rah jaaoge
 If you do such work, the government will not be formed
 chaahe dushman ko hi tikat kyon na mili, lekin use jitao
 "after this, what Digvijay said, he said that he was constantly ignoring the Congress
 digvijay ne kaha ki meraa kaam sirf ek he- koi prachaar nahin, koi bhaashan nahin
 Because of my speech, Congress votes are cut, so i do not go anywhere

 When Congress President Rahul Gandhi came to Bhopal, his cutouts were missing at the road show and the rally site at Bhel Dussehra ground
 puure shahar main jahaan tamaam congressi netaaon kii tasviren or hording dikhaai de raheen thim, vahiin digvijay singh kii hording najar naa aane se party kii aapasi gutbaji bhi saaf najar ai
 However, Congress state president Kamal Nath later apologized to him
 lekin congress ke anya netaa khud maan rahe hai ki digvijay singh ke khilaaf congress main hi sajeesh ho rahi he
 Senior Congress leader Manak Aggarwal said that Digvijay Singh's disappearance from the posters was a conspiracy against him
 maanak agarwal kii maane to isaki shikaayat congress haikaman ke paas bhi gai hui he
 The BJP lashed out at the video of Tanjibjp spokesperson Rajneesh Agarwal, saying that Digvijay Singh himself had started to believe that the Congress was mistreating him
 rajnish ne kaha ki congress unase kaam to puraa leti he lekin baad main dutkaar detii he
 In the election year, the Congress has kept its distance from Digvijay Singh so far, but with this old Chanakya of politics, this disinterested Congress may not overwhelm the Congress in the upcoming assembly elections
 mangalvaar shaam achaanak landan main vijay maalya kii giraftaar kii khabar ai or thodi der baad jamaanat kii bhi khabar aa gai
 After this Mallya tweeted and targeted the Indian media itself
 iske baad soshal media par log sawaal khadey karne lage ki kya maalya ko sarkaar waapas bharat laa paaegi
 It was said on behalf of the government that no one will be spared and let the process be completed now
 mushkil he lekin sambhav he
 Do you know what are the steps through which Mallya, accused in the Rs 9000 crore loan default case, will be brought back to India? Out of the 9 stages of extradition, this is the extradition treaty of India with firstbritain
 mangalvaar ke maamle se maalya ke khilaaf pratyrpan kii karrwai kii shuruyaat ho gai lekin ye pratyrpan ke 9 charnon se pehla charan hi he
 Mallya will get 3 chances to appeal
 kya he bharat-britain main pratyrpan sandhi?bharat or britain ke bich 1993 main pratyrpan sandhi hui thi
 Under this, provision was made to extradite the wanted people between the two countries
 maalya ke khilaaf mani londring, lone difolt samet kai maamle chal rahe hai
 The Government of India sent a request for extradition of Mallya through the British High Commission
 kaise hoga pratyrpan par faisla?british sarkaar ke mutabik bahurashtriya canavension or dwipaksheeya sandhiyon ke tahat britain duniya ke kareeb 100 deshon ke saath pratyrpan sandhi rakhata he
 These include India in Category 2 type b countries
 bharat jis shrenee main he, usamen shaamil deshon se aane vaale aagrah par faisla britain kaa videsh mantralay or adaalatein, donon karte hai
 The process is quite lengthy
 -videsh mantri se aagrah kiya jayega, jo is baat kaa faisalaa karata he ki ise certifoi kiya jaae yaa nahin
 -judge decides whether to issue a warrant for arrest
 iske baad shuruaati sunwaayee hogi
 - Then turn will come for extradition hearing
 phir videsh mantralay faisla karata he ki pratyrpan kaa aadesh diya jaae yaa nahin
 - The invading country is asked to hand over the initial draft of the request to the Crown Prosecution Service, so that no problems arise later
 -pehle british grih mantralay kii international criminlity unit is aagrah par vichaar karti he
 If found fit, it is extended to the solicitation court
 -agar adaalat sahamat hoti he ki paryaapt jaankaree uplabdh karai gai he, to giraftaar warrant jari kiya jayega
 It contains all the information related to a particular person
 -giraftaari ke baad shuruaati sunwaayee or pratyrpan sunwaayee hoti he
 After the completion of the hearing, if the judge is satisfied then the matter is extended to the Ministry of External Affairs
 -iske baavjood jiske pratyrpan par baatcheet ho rahi he, vah shaks maamla videsh mantralay ko bhejne ke jaj ke faisle par apil kar saktaa he
 After considering the case, the Ministry of External Affairs decides
 teen surat aisi he, jinke hone par pratyrpan nahin kiya ja sakegaa:agar pratyrpan ke baad vyakti ke khilaaf sazaa-e-maut kaa faisla aane kaa dar ho to, agar aagrah karne vaale desh ke saath koi vishesh intjaam ho to, agar vyakti ko kisi tisare mulq se britain main pratyrpit kiya gaya ho to
 The special thing is that a decision has to be taken within two months of sending the case to the Ministry of External Affairs
 aisa naa hone par vyakti reeha karne ke liye aavedan kar saktaa he
 However, the foreign minister can get the court to give a date for the decision
 is puri prakriya ke baad bhi vyakti ke paas hai court or supreme court main apil karne kaa adhikaar rahata he
 Overall, the road to Mallya's return to India is quite complex and long
 ye bhi padhein
 
 
 Due to this, Mallya, who became 'king of Bad Times' from the business tycoon, had fled from Delhi to London, Mallya had failed to catch
 
 
 jamaanat ke baad bhartiya media par bhadke maalya, bole- badha-chadhaakar pesh kiyamalya ke alaava in chaar logon ne bhi lagaai desh ko hajaaron-karodon kii chapatarbaipuoush KING maalya kii is ek jid ne unhen bana daalaa kangaal!kab bharat ne kiya tha anurodh?bharat sarkaar ne pichley saal may main britain se kaha tha ki maalya ko lautaa diya jaae kyonki unka passport radd kar diya gaya he
 The British government said that one does not have to have a valid passport to stay here, but because there is a serious charge against Mallya, his extradition will be considered
 kya kehete hai jaankaar?varisht vakil keties tulsi kaa kahana he ki maalya ke pratyrpan main kai saal lag sakate hai
 It will depend on what kind of documents the Indian government presents to the British government
 varisht vakil prashanth bhushan kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ko lalit modi ke khilaaf pratyrpan kii karrwai bhi shuru kerani chahie
 The government's response to Mallya's case has been very slow
 baitool main apane maayke ai ek yuvati kaa sonaghati kshetra main nau yuvakon dwaara ashleel ms banane kaa sansanikhej maamla prakaash main aayaa he
 For the past two months, the girl was being blackmailed by the youth threatening to make porn MMS public

 According to sources, a girl resident of Betul was married in Maharashtra
 may, 2011 main yuvati apane maayke ai hui thi
 According to the police, on May 10, 2011, the girl went to visit Sonaghati near Betul with her relative, where 8-9 youths assaulted both of them and took them to the forest nursery
 yuvakon ne yuvati ko daraa-dhamkaakar mobile se uskaa video banaaya tathaa ashleel ms ko saarvajanik karne kii dhamkee dekar 20 hajaar rupye kii mangakar use blackmel karne lage

 He said that after registering a crime against the accused in the Kotwali police station, four accused Devendra Waghmare, Manoj Sarle resident Danora, Parvez Ahmed, Mushtaq Ahmed resident Betul were arrested, while the police was actively searching for the five accused

 ) The BJP can contest the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections without a face even as no final decision has been taken to give face to the party
 party sutron ke mutabik is samay party ke paas aisa koi sarvamaanya cheharaa nahin hai jo sabhi jaateey samikarnon par khara utarataa ho
 In such a situation, the BJP does not want to make any leader representing a particular caste community the face of the party
 isliye jaruri nahin he ki party chunaav se pehle cheharaa lekar hi utre
 Not a face that fits all caste equations
 The party still has names like Rajnath Singh, Yogi Adityanath, Varun Gandhi and Keshav Prasad Maurya in Uttar Pradesh
 magar party ke netaaon kaa maananaa he ki inamen se aisa koi bhi netaa nahin jo sabhi jati main send laga sake
 Some leaders have a big name but according to the ground reality, the party will move forward
 beshak media main ye sab naam chal rahe hai lekin party ne abhi is disha main koi antim faisla nahin liya he ki wo phase ke sahare hi party chunaav main jaaegi
 PM Modi's face is the biggest party leadership thinks that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's face is the biggest face, with the help of which he will win elections in UP
 saath hi vahaan ke jaateey samikarnon main talmail rakhane ke liye bijepi puri tarah se lagi he
 The party has also tried to force OBC leader Swami Prasad Maurya, who left the BSP in this direction, to pull Maurya who left BSP
 bijepi netaaon kaa maananaa he ki swami prasad maury ke bispi se baahar aane se unhen koi phayda ho yaa na ho magar bispi ko nuksaan jarur hoga or uskaa phayda bijepi ko milegaa
 However, the BJP wants to bring Swami Prasad Maurya into its fold
 maury se bijepi ke kuch netaa kai baar mil bhi chuke hai magar unke party main aane par antim nirnay nahin hua he
 BJP has an eye on OBC votes, 11% of obcs in the state and 20% of other obcs are on bjp's eye
 isliye party ne keshav prasad maury ko upi kaa adhyaksh banaaya he or swami prasad maury par bijepi kii najar he taaki obisi votaron ko pakkaa kiya ja sake
 The fog has taken the pace of the Narels
 har din saikadon trainen der se chal rahi hai or kai to apane gantavy par ghanton vilamb se pahunch rahi hai
 Due to this, the passengers are suffering a lot and sometimes, they travel hungry and thirsty
 lekin bhartiya rail aise yatriyon kii pareshaani dur karne ke liye kadam uthaa rahaa he

 iarsitisi ne bataaya ki ab shatabdi, duranto, rajdhani or premium express trainon ke do ghante se adhik let hone paryatriyon ko chaay-naashtaa yaa khanaabhi diya jayega
 This will depend on the time and duration of delay
 iske liye koi keemat nahin vasuuli jaaegi or yah nishulk hoga
 But there is no such facility for ordinary travelers
 logon kaa kahana he ki aisi haalat main railway ko kam se kam sasti daron par is tarah kii suvidha uplabdh karaani chahie

 seemapar pakistan se kashmir ghati main maujuud aatankiyon ko sidhaa sport mila rahaa he
 As part of the new strategy, cross-border Lashkar bosses have asked the local commander in the Kashmir Valley to intensify the incitement of local people against the army

 During the last 4 months, the army has killed about 50 such dreaded terrorists

 har roj suryaast se pehle donon deshon kii seemaa kii raksha karne vaale bal beating reatreet seremani main hissaa lete hai
 He said that there would be no beating retreat ceremony at the Wagah border for three days from Saturday on Pakistan's request
 pathak ne bataaya, 'ham is ilaake main pehle hi alert the kyonki hamen kuch dinon pehle hi soochna mili thi ki is ilaake ko nishaanaa banaaya ja saktaa he
 Now that the explosion has taken place, we have also alerted our units on this border
 ' unhone kaha ki unke bal kii taraf se unhen bataaya gaya he ki wagha seemaa se kareeb 500 meter kii duuri par dhamaakaa hua
 Pathak said that the Pakistani Rangers initially reported that there was a blast in a cylinder at a tea shop, but now it has been learned that it was a suicide attack
 chambal nadi ke pani ke bantwaare ko lekar madhya pradesh or rajasthan ke bich talavaarein khinch gai he
 The root of the dispute is the sharing of river water
 madhya pradesh kaa aarope he ki labalab bhare hone ke baavjood rajasthan gandhi sagar baandh se uske hisse kaa pani nahin chhod rahaa he jiske kaaran chambal anchal ke kisaanon kii fasalein suukh rahi hai
 But Rajasthan is not ready to accept this charge
 uskaa kahana he ki madhya pradesh ne iske pehle kisi bhi manch par is mudde ko nahin uthaaya he
 However, the reality is that the farmers of Madhya Pradesh are suffering as a result of the laxity of the Madhya Pradesh government
 muraina jile ke holapura gaanv ke kisaan 40 varshiya pancham singh kehete hai, ''nahar main pani kii kami ke chalate gehun kii fasal har saal prabhavit hoti he
 According to an agreement reached in the sixties, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan should get 50–50 per cent water from the dams built on the Chambal river
 lekin madhya pradesh ko puraa pani kabhi mila hi nahin
 Last year, when the state got 45 percent water, there was a record production of rabi crop in Chambal region
 pani ke bantwaare ko lekar gat saal disambar main donon rajyon ke adhikariyon kii baithak hui lekin isamen bhi vivaad nahin sulajh
 Chief Engineer of Water Resources Department of Chambal Region N
 pi
 Kori says, "ever since the Chambal canal system was built, we have not received all the water
 rajasthan ne dhaulpur ke paas chambal nadi main ek water lifting plant bhi laga liya he jisase nadi kaa jalastr kam ho rahaa he
 Officials in Madhya Pradesh allege that due to less water, Chambal canal system is not being fully exploited
 nahar ke antim muhane tak pahunch paane ke lihaaj se bhi pani paryaapt nahin he
 Kori says, "currently about 2 for irrigation in Gandhi Sagar Dam
 42 million acre feet (emef) pani uplabdh he, jisamen se mapra kaa hisse 1
 There is 21 MAF which can irrigate about 3 lakh hectare area of chambal
 lekin hamen sirf0
 70 MAF water is being provided
 ''madhya pradesh ke jal sansaadhan mantri jayant malaiya bhi aarope ko doharaate hue kehete hai, ''madhya pradesh ko rojaanaa kareeb 3900 kusek pani milanaa chahie, lekin aisa ho nahin rahaa he
 The water projects and agreements between the two states will be reviewed again to resolve the matter
 vivaad kaa hal phir bhi nahin nikalataa he to is maamle ko kendriya jal sansaadhan vibhaag ke saamne uthaaya jayega
 In fact, for the Chambal region, the Water Resources Department of Madhya Pradesh spent crores of rupees
 kharch karke chambal anchal main naharon kaa jaal bichaaya he taaki kisaanon ko pani uplabdh ho sake or fasal bhi bharpoor ho sake
 But these canals remain dry
 baavjood iske ki chambal nadi ke cachament kshetra main madhya pradesh kaa yogadan 70 fisadi he, jabaki rajasthan kaa yogadan maatr 30 fisadi
 Whenever there is a sharing of river water between the two states, special attention is paid to the contribution in the catchment area
 lekin zyada yogadan ke baavjood madhya pradesh nuksaan main he
 However, Rajasthan's Water Resources Minister Hemaram Choudhary is also unwilling to believe that there is a dispute between Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan over the sharing of Chambal river water
 ve kehete hai, ''madhya pradesh ke saath koi anyaay nahin ho rahaa
 We are giving them complete water
 disambar maheene main dilli kii ucch stareey baithak hui thi usamen bhi madhya pradesh ne aisa koi maamla nahin uthaaya
 This issue did not come up in the meeting held on 16 January
 '' pichley saal hui acchhee barsaat ke kaaran gandhi sagar baandh main itnaa pani he ki usase is saal bhi achche se sinchai ho sakati he
 But this is possible only when Madhya Pradesh gets all its share of water

 Amid the loud noise and tokatoki of the opposition during zero hour in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi took a direct target on the Hazare side and said that people as individuals have made great contributions to the country
 unhone desh kii aazaadee or vikaas ke liye logon ko golband kiya lekin vyaktigat farmaan ko, bhale hi unka iraadaa kitna hi nek kyon na ho, loktantric prakriya ko kamjor nahin karnaa chahie
 See how Anna Hazare, who was arrested, said that the democratic process is often very long and disturbing but it is so that it is holistic and just
 yah ek pratinidhitiv vaala or paardarshee manch uplabdh karaati he jahaan vichaar kanoon main badalte hai
 Amidst overwhelming support from the ruling party and strong opposition from the opposition, Rahul Gandhi said that any clever infiltration other than the system of elected government in the system of control and balance established to protect the supremacy of Parliament would prove to be a dangerous tradition for democracy
 anna ke andolan par aapaki bheji tasvirensadan main pradhanmantri manmohan singh, sadan ke netaa pranav mukherjee, vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj tathaa varisht bhaajapa netaa laalkrishna adwani or spikar ddeergha main maujuud priyanka gandhi kii maujuudagi main rahul ne lalkaarte hue kaha ki aaj prastaavit kanoon bhrashtachar ke viruddh he
 Tomorrow, this target may be on something else
 yah hamaare samaaj ke bahulwaad or loktantr ko nishaanaa bana saktaa he
 Surrounded by the 'young Brigade' of the Congress, Rahul went a step ahead of Anna Hazare's Jan Lokpal Bill and suggested why the Lokpal should be made a parliamentary accountable constitutional body like the Election Commission of India
 main samajhataa hum ki samay aa gaya he ki jab ham is vichaar par gambhirtha se manthan karen
 Jansalab, who came out in support of Anna, said with his suggestion that we are talking about the legal ombudsman but our debate stops at the point of accountability of the ombudsman to the public and the danger of its own being corrupted
 rahul ne kaha ki kanoon or santhaan apane aap main kaaphi nahin he
 a representative, inclusive and easily accessible democracy is needed to fight corruption
 rahul ne kaha ki pichley kuch dinon ke ghatnakram se main behad dukhi hum
 i am deeply pained by many aspects of the situation
 kya he jan lokapal bill?vipaksh ke varisht netaa yashavanth sinha or anant kumaar sahit bhaajapa ke lagbhag sabhi sadasyon kii baari tokataki ke bich congress mahasachiv ne kaha ki madam spikar, ham keval chaahane bhar se apane jivan se bhrashtachar ko samaapt nahin kar sakate hai
 For this, a comprehensive action plan and a sustained political program will be needed which has the support of all levels of governance, from high to low
 isse bhi zyada ise raajnneetik ichhashakti kii jarurat he
 He said that we all know that corruption is all around
 yah har str par maujuud he
 It is the highest burden on the poor and every Indian wants to get rid of it
 vishesh kavarejrahul ne kaha ki ek prabhavakaari lokapal kanoonee taur par bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladane kaa madhyam he kintu sirf lokapal bhrashtacharheen aacharan ke liye paryaapt vikalp nahin he
 Many effective laws are needed
 aise kanoon jo ki kuch jaruri masalon ko lokapal ke saath hi saath sambodhit karen
 The other laws he suggested with the Lokpal to fight corruption are as follows
 pehle suzav ke tahat unhone kaha ki chunaav or raajnneetik dalon ko sarkaar kii ore se vitt poshan, doosraa suzav, saarvajanik kharid main paardarshita , teesraa suzav, bhoomi evam khanan jaise maamalon kaa sahi niyaman, jiske abhaav main bhrashtachar punap rahaa he
 The fourth is to create a comprehensive mechanism for the process of problem solving in public distribution services such as the minimum support price, ration cards and old-age pensions, and as a final suggestion to continuously improve the tax system for redress from tax evasion
 bhrashtachar se ladaai ke hajaare ke tareeke se paroksh asahmati jataane ke saath hi rahul ne is baat ko sweekaar kiya ki chaaron ore desh main jo bhrashtachar failaa he, uske prati upje rosh ko anna ji ne aawaaj di he
 i thank them for this
 rahul ne haalanki anna ke andolan par sawaal sa uthaate hue kaha ki pichley dinon kii ghatnaon kaa sakshi hone par kadaachit aisa prathit hota he ki ek kanoon ke ban jane se jaise puure samaaj se bhrashtachar mit jayega
 i have deep doubts about this
 unhone kaha ki ek prabhavakaari lokapal kanoonee taur par bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladane kaa madhyam he lekin sirf lokapal bhrashtacharheen aacharan ke liye paryaapt vikalp nahin he
 a year after returning to the Indian team after recovering from cancer, Yuvraj Singh is again preparing to return and the champion cricketer, who has seen many ups and downs in the last 12 months, believes that his passion to play for the country constantly motivates him to return

 Recently, Yuvraj, who returned to France after six weeks of hard work on fitness, is now trying to come back on the basis of good performance in domestic cricket
 yuvaraj ne ek intervyuu main kaha, 'pichhlaa ek saal mere liye kaaphi kathin rahaa
 i saw a lot of ups and downs
 vishwa cap se pehle chot, vishwa cap ke baad cancer kaa pataa chalanaa or phir vaapasi ke baad team se baahar hona, ye sabhi kathin chunautiyaan thi, lekin har baar cricket ke liye meraa junun mujhe vaapasi ko prerit karata rahaa
 "all-rounder, who was the Player of the Tournament in the World Cup 2011, said," The feeling of coming back to play has never been from within me
 usee ne mujhe in chunautiyon kaa saamana karne kii urja di
 In the last two-three years, my body has not felt so good from within, as i am now
 maine aaf sijan training main kaaphi mehnat kii he or ummid he ki uskaa nateeja maichon main dekhne ko milegaa, chaahe gharelu ho yaa antarrashtriya
 Criticism is part of the player's life, describing the criticism as part of the player's life, Yuvraj said that after playing 13 years of international cricket, he is no longer affected by it
 tej gendbaaj jahir khan ke saath france main abhyaas ke bare main poochne par unhone kaha, 'vahaan focus puraa fitness par tha
 We had completely removed attention from cricket, media and everything
 jahir or main ek duusare ko prerit karte rahete the ki hamen kaaphi mehnat kerani he
 We used to fix each other's mistakes during the workout
 training kaaphi thakaau thi or bich main ham kabhi mood halkaa karne ke liye filmein bhi dekhte the
 'yuvraj said about the biggest change that came from this practice,' i felt that my agility was decreasing
 bhaagane or riect karne main teji kam ho rahi thi lihaaja us par mehnat karnaa jaruri tha
 i was fit in the IPL, but then i had to struggle due to a back injury
 ab main pehle kii tarah mahasoos kar rahaa hum or saare praaroop khilne ko taiyaar hum
 Regarding the competition from young players to return to the team, Yuvraj said that he has full confidence in his ability
 unhone kaha, 'senior ho yaa junior, team main jagah banane ke liye mehnat kerani padati he
 i have been playing for India for 13 years
 mujhe apni kshamta par puraa vishwaas he or ummid he ki acha khelkar jald hi team main vaapasi karuunga
 Yuvraj is now eyeing the Challenger Trophy to be held in September, but he wants to play some local matches when he gets a chance before that

 a case of rape of a 4-year-old nursery student has come to light in Mumbai
 is silsile main juhu police stesan main skool bas ke clinar ke khilaaf balaatkaar kaa maamla darj hua he
 This cleaner named Ramesh Rajput has been sent to police custody till 1 February
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki 35 varshiya aaropee, ramesh rajput ne ladki ke saath dushkarm ke baad kisi ko bhi kuch naa bataane kii dhamkee bhi di thi
 The rape of the nursery girl in Mumbai was revealed when the nervous girl informed her father on Wednesday
 bacchee ke pita ne skool principal se is baat kii shikaayat kii, skool prashasan ne is maamle ko juhu police ko saunpa jisane aaropee ramesh rajput ko mumbai ke viley parley ilaake se giraftaar kar liya
 Under the school bus safety policy of the Government of Maharashtra, it is necessary to be a ladies bus attendant in the school buses where the students travel
 is baat kii bhi jaanch kii ja rahi he kii jis 16 seater bas main nursery chaatra se balaatkaar kii ghatana ghati us main atendent maujuud thi yaa nahin
 Apart from this, the question also arises that as the school bus does not the school also have any responsibility
 skool ke principal kii jimmedaari hoti he ki wo bacchon kii suraksha pakki kare a research has revealed that people who watch the news are more spiritual than those who do not see it
 saath hi log subah-subandhik aadhyatmikote hai, isiilie is samay ve puja-paath jaisi gatividhiyon main shaamil hote hai
 a new research has shown this fact
 uniwarsity of kennectikat ke shodhakartaaon ne kaha ki jab log kaam main vyast rahete hai, tab aadhyatm ke prati unka rujhaan sabase kam hota he
 People also have high awareness of spirituality while listening to music, reading or exercising

 'spiritual awareness is reduced while working
 kaam ke prati jununee logon main yah sabase kam hoti he
 There is a complex relationship between spiritual awareness and circumstances
 unhone kaha, 'kabhi-kabhi halaat aapaki aadhyatmik jaagrukta ko prabhavit karte hai, to kabhi-kabhi aapaki aadhyatmik jaagrukta aapke halaat ko prabhavit karti he

 is baar kaa gujarat kaa chunaav piem modi or amit shah ke liye naak kaa sawaal ban gaya hai
 Because the model of Gujarat development was paved way to Delhi
 isliye ye chunaav jeetna piem modi or amit shah ke liye bahut jaruri he
 But one must not forget that Amit Shah had posted 8 xxrep 4 0 thousand Panna Pramukhs in the Delhi Assembly elections too
 lekin chunaav nateezon par iskaa koi asar nahin hua or dilli main bijepi haar gai

 nasir ne to team india ke teen khilaadiyon ko hi gadhaa kaha lekin maryaada todane main maaikel won unase bhi ek kadam aage bad gayi
 Now how will this not touch the players of Team India
 england ke purv captain nasir hossain jab team india ke khilaaf apmaan kii aag ugal rahe the, to unheen ke saathi maaikel won is aag main ghi daal rahe the
 Former England captain Michael Vaughan tweeted on Nasir Hussain's comment and added salt to Team India's wounds
 won ne twit kiya- nasir hossain ne kaha ki bhartiya team main kuch gadhe hai
 How can it be wrong? maine kam se kam chaar gadhe dekhe hai
 He is the same Vaughan who accused VVS Laxman of dishonesty during the second Test
 unhone kaha tha ki vivies balle ke bahari kinare par vaseline lagaate hai taaki balle or gend kaa sampark takanic pard naa paae
 Has the recent success of England lost the mind of Nasir Hussain and Michael Vaughan? Do these two not remember the same Indian team won the World Cup a few days ago? jis khilaadi ko wo gadhaa kah rahe hai, vahi khilaadi kai baar match kaa pasa palat chuke hai
 In the first ODI, Parthiv Patel proved him with the bat, what Indian team member Virat Kohli said on Nasir's remarks
 to nasir hossain or maaikel won jubaan sambhaal ke
 Abusing Team India can backfire
 bhuuliye mat england kii team ko abhi bharat main khelnaa he or bharat main england kaa kya haal ho saktaa he, ye aap donon se behatar bhala koun jaan saktaa he

 He said that pride should never come after gaining power
 maine to kabhi koi pad nahin maanga
 There were many ups and downs with Netaji in the party, but we managed together
 shivpal ne kaha ki meraa naukari main appointment ho gaya tha lekin aana to raajnneeti main hi tha
 Remembering the things of his childhood, Shivpal said that i was very small, then even the legs did not come in the bicycle, if the bicycle was found, it seemed like a very big car was found
 shivpal ne kaha, 'netaa ji ke kehane par raajnneeti main aayaa
 Otherwise he would have done farming

 The ticket was received in 1996 when Netaji went to Delhi
 'unhone kaha ki kuch logon ko bina mehnat hi sabakuch mil jaataa he
 The time came that we could not do anything
 shivpal ne kaha ki unhone netaa ji (mulaayam singh yadav) se puch kar samaajawaadee secular morcha kaa gathan kiya he
 This is a crusade, in which the victory will be of religion and truth
 ye ladaai samaajik parivartan or nyaay kii he
 Shivpal further said, 'those who have become great have had a crisis
 dharm par chalane vaale kii kabhi haar nahin hoti

 He said, 'I think it is up to the people to decide whether it was a smear
 main apana bachaav nahin karnaa chahta
 My role was that of mentor and coach
 logon ko tay karnaa he ki maalikon or anshadhariyon kii harkaton ko kya kochon or menter se joda janaa chaiye

 'yah tay karnaa meraa kaam nahinyah poochne par ki kya yah kadaa faisla tha, dravid ne kaha, 'yah tay karnaa meraa kaam nahin he ki faisla kadaa tha yaa nahin

 Dravid, who was the mentor of the team at the time, said that it is very difficult for a coach to find out who is involved in corruption
 dravid ne kaha, 'main nahin jaanata tha ki ye teen khilaadi kuch sandigdh kar rahe hai
 If i had known, i would have dealt with it
 mujhe koi andeshaa nahin tha or maine mudgal samiti se is bare main saaf baat kii he
 It is difficult to find out who is wrong, he said, “despite being in a team, it is difficult to find out whether someone is involved in spot fixing or not
 yadi main har wide bal yaa chauke par shaq karne laguun to khel se pyaar or usamen ruchi khatm ho jaayegi
 That is why i do not doubt the players for hitting fours and sixes in every match or team
 dravid ne kaha ki bhavishya main aisi ghatnaon ke doharaav se bachane ke liye satark rahanaa jaruri he
 He said, 'when such issues arise, the image of cricket is smeared

 For the first time any central agency took any step against the Maoist leader
 isse pehle unhen hameshaa centre or rajya sarkaron ke aapasi jhagade kaa laabh miltaa rahaa he
 Here the issue of land has been the root of the problem

 Ganapati later turned against this class

 ”karimnagar main maowad kii neenv ek macrsvaadi chaatr sanghathan radical students union (aarasau) se padi, jiske jariye saare maovadi netaa milte the
 Ganapathy and other student leaders, who graduated from Telangana, also slowly pulled towards RSU
 unke saath hi kuch duusare maovadi vichaarak bhi isamen shaamil hue, jaise warangal ke riginal ejineering college se gold medalist cherukuri rajkumaar urf aaazaad (jise andhra pradesh police ne 2010 main maar daalaa) or kishanji
 When Emergency was imposed in the country, Ganpati was arrested in 1977 in a case of violence and robbery

 The organization was a follower of Mao Tse Tung and his book Lal Kitab, which believed that power emanates from the barrel of the gun and, like its chairman, envisioned three steps to achieve it: from remote bastions to villages and then to cities
 ye netaa jaise-jaise sanghathan ke bheetar oonche paaydaanon par pahunchate gaye, unhone apana upnaam rakh liya or apane ghar-parivaar, bivi-bachche or puraani yaadon ko peeche chhod diya

 usee ne 2007 main chhattisgarh ke ranibodali main ek police camp par hamale kaa netritv kiya tha, jisamen 55 pulisavaale maare gaye the
 Gangadhar explains, "he (tirupati) told me that he has no family

 Landmines: The Naxals used their most destructive weapon, the landmines, in Birpur village of Ganapati for the first time
 1989 main peedbluji ne ek jeep ko yah soch kar barudi surang se uda diya tha ki vah police kii he
 Jeep ravages flew in the blast and small pieces of the body of the 17 people who were in it hung on the trees
 pataa chalaa ki vah baraat thi or usamen ganpati ke sanyukt parivaar ke sadsy bhi shaamil the
 The Maoists immediately issued an apology over the incident, but their war against the state continued

 On the side of which Telugu Amma is looking, at some distance there is a 15 feet high pillar with a sickle-hammer on the top and written on the names of 'inquilabi' martyrs who got shot by the police
 ise maovadiyon ne yahaan sthapit kiya tha
 In response to this, the state government has pointed out a white pillar nearby which has a pigeon and has written the names of common citizens killed by Maoists

 He explains, "the triple strategy of road construction, the elimination of armed forces and the rehabilitation of surrendered Maoists

 Due to heavy capital investment in the police force and intelligence network, the ultra-naxalite anti-naxalite Greyhounds commandos have conducted precise operations here with the help of intelligence

 In September 2003, the Maoists also attacked the then Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu's convoy with landmines
 lekin usee saal se pasa palatnaa shuru ho chukaa tha
 The Maoist leadership of Karimnagar then channeled its strength into the forests of Dandakaranya, a wooded area of 92,000 sq km bordering Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha

 In 2007, Maoists rode a government bus and blew up a police post at Murakinar in Bijapur district of Chhattisgarh, a Naxalite Telugu officer
 hamale main halki mashinaganon kaa bhi istemaal kiya gaya tha
 At the end of a shaken video recording of the same attack, a voice in Telugu says, 'vanakk Emanann Migillera?' (is anyone else left?) a voice-over in the Gondi language of the tribals states that 11 policemen were killed in this attack
 haalanki telegu main die jane vaale nirdesh se aapako andaja lag jaataa he ki is abhiyaan main kiski chal rahi he
 It is a state-of-the-art corps of Andhra Naxalite officers, under whose control an army of 10,000 tribal guerrilla fighters has a dream of overthrowing the Indian government by 2050

 Bhanwari Devi, the nurse who created panic in the entire politics of Rajasthan, will never come back
 kyonki usak katl ho chukaa he or uski laash ko jangal main jala diya gaya he
 According to CBI, Bhanwari was not murdered by anyone else but at the behest of former Rajasthan strongman and powerful ministers Mahipal Maderna and Malkhan Singh

 Now CBI has also added the last episode of Bhanwari murder case and arrested the vicious criminal who burnt Bhanwari's body in the forest from Pune
 daawa ye bhi he ki sibiai ne bhavari kii laash ke tukde bhi dhund nikaale hai
 This is the date when Sohanlal alerted Bhanwaridevi that the buyers of the CD had arrived from Mumbai to Bilada
 ye mahipal maderna or bhavari kii sidi kaa sauda ho rahaa tha
 Sohanlal had assured Bhanwari that he would be given sixty lakh rupees in return for the CD

 Rajubhai was none other than Shahabuddin, the dreaded criminal of Rajasthan
 jo raju banakar sidi kaa sauda karne aayaa tha
 Bhanwari was completely unaware that she is now trapped in the woven web of Sohanlal and Shahabuddin
 shahabuddin ne jeep ke sidi player main sidi lagaai or puri 52 minute kii puri film jeep main hi dekhi
 During this time, the jeep continued to run around on the road
 jeep ke peeche sohanlal ek swift car main chal rahaa tha
 So that Bhanwari does not have any kind of doubt
 ab shaam ho chali thi
 And Bhanwari asked Shahabuddin to give him the money and leave it back
 lekin shahabuddin ne anakani karnaa shuru kii to bhavari ko shaq ho gaya or usne jeep main hi shor machaana shuru kar diya
 Seeing the noise of Bhanwari, Sohanlal also came inside the Bullero and these three put Bhanwari under the jeep seat
 jeep ke andar hi juuton se rond kar bhavari ko maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 The link between this conspiracy was Sahiram
 malakhan singh or mahipal maderna kaa khaas gurga sahiram
 Which was monitoring this plan of murder from Jyoti Nagar area of jodhpur
 bhavari ke katl ke baad usne sohan laal ko hukum diya ki bhavari kii laash jaloda ke apradhi bishnaram ko laash saunp de

 The battle between 2 sisters and brother to become a female priest in the Kalka temple and the offering to the temple has reached an interesting turn in the Delhi High Court
 mangalvaar ko hi dilli hai court ne sawaal kiya tha ki kalkaji mandir main mahilaayein seva kyon nahi kar sakati or pujaarin banane kaa haq mahilaon ko kyon nahin he
 Shashibala and Vijayalakshmi, these two sisters of the same family, have petitioned to become priests in the Kalkaji temple and share in the offerings in the temple that they should also get the same right to become priests and take offerings as their priest's brother has got
 shashibala or vijayalakshmi ko court isliye aana padaa kyonki bhai ne bina court aae unki baat suni hi nahin
 The lower court of Bhadilli, which is harassing the sisters, ruled in favor of the two sisters, which was challenged by their priest brother in the High Court
 2003 se ab tak har baar kalkaji mandir me aane valechadhaveme shashibala or vijayalakshmi ko bhai se hissaa tabhi mila he jab unhone court kaa rukh kiya or khud court ne aadesh diya
 But so far the priest has kept the sisters away from the right to serve in the temple
 kalkaji mandir ke itihaas main kabhi koi mahila pujaarin nahin banaai gai he
 Shashibala said that brother Satyadev's behavior is very bad
 mandir me har jagah unke log baithe hue he
 They don't even let us climb the stairs of the temple
 15 saal se court main masaladonon bahanen umr ke chathe dashak me chal rahi hai
 Both are widows
 unke paas aay kaa koi or jariya nahin he
 In such a situation, this offering is a means of running the expenses of their house, but for taking their right from their own brother, they are forced to go to the court office continuously for 15 years
 shuukravaar ko aa saktaa he faislahai court main kalkaji me aane vaale chadhaave se mandir ke raakrakhaav par bhi sawaal uthe
 In the High Court hearing on Wednesday, the court even said that if there is so much problem with the distribution of the offerings, then why not hand over the Kalkaji temple to Vaishno Devi Trust or any other such trust
 dilli hai court ne kalkaji ke pujari ke vakil se poocha tha ki mandiron main mahilaayein puja or seva kyon nahin kar saktin? hai court shuukravaar ko is maamle me koi faisla suna saktaa he

 enpie kii samasya se jujh se banking sector ko ubaarane ke liye kendra sarkaar 2017 main echardiai bill lekar ai thi
 This bill has been withdrawn by the Central Government
 is faisle se desh main karodon bank khataadharakon ko raahat pahunchi he
 This FRDI bill would give the powers to the public and private banks of the country to overcome the crisis which would directly affect crores of bank account holders
 kya he echardiai bilkendra sarkaar dwaara prastaavit echardiai bill se sarkaar sabhi vittiya sansthaaon jaise bank, insurance company or anya vittiya sanghathanon kaa insolvency or bankerpsi code ke tahat uchit niraakaran karnaa chaah rahi thi
 By making this bill a law, the central government would try to bail out the sick financial companies from the crisis
 is bill kii jarurat 2008 ke vittiya sankat ke baad mahasoos kii gai jab kai hai-profile bankerpsi dekhne ko mili thi
 Since then, the Central Government has made continuous efforts with decisions like Jan Dhan Yojana and Demonetisation that more and more people should remain under the banking system
 iske chalate yah behad jaruri ho jaataa he ki banking vyavastha main shaamil ho chuke logon ko bank yaa vittiya sanstha ke doobane kii sthiti main apane paison kii suraksha kii guarantee rahe
 Read this: According to the central government, FRDI will be protected by law and your money deposited in the bank
 The main provision of the FRDI bill was to create a resolution corporation in this bill
 is corporation ko diposit insurance or credit guarantee corporation kii jagah khadaa kiya jaataa
 This resolution corporation monitors the health of financial institutions and tries to save them in the event of their drowning
 vahiin jab vittiya sanstha kaa doobana tay rahegaa to aisi sthiti main unki vittiya dendaree kaa samaadhaan is corporation ko karnaa tha
 It is to be noted that one of the important functions of the resolution corporation is also to provide deposit insurance to the customers, although the limit of this insurance has not been fixed yet
 kyon he echardiai bill se darefardiai bill ke jariye rejolution corporation ko fail hone vaali sanstha ko ubaarane ke liye (bel in) kadam uthaane kaa bhi adhikaar he
 While the government invests the money of the public in a sluggish economy through bailout, it can be used to bail it out, while the bail-in is used to salvage the bank in crisis with the money of bank customers
 ise padhein: NPA bana boj, bainkon kii sehat sudhaarney main sarkaar ke chute paseenettel gaya bank balance par chaaya sankatechardiai bill ke isi praavdhaan ke chalate aam logon main dar tha ki yadi unka bank vifal hota he to unhen apni gadhi kamai se haath dhonaa pad saktaa he
 It is to be noted that according to the current provision, in the event of a bank sinking, the customer has a guarantee of just Rs 1 lakh in the total amount deposited in his account and banks are not obliged to return the remaining money
 prastaavit echardiai bill main philhal sarkaar ne ganrti kii is rakam par abhi koi faisla nahin liya he
 The Central Government had clarified on the proposed Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill 2017 (FRDI Bill) that the bill introduced in Parliament did not offer any such change in the existing security provisions for bank customers which harmed their interests
 Arrived
 iske alaava kendra sarkaar ne daawa bhi kiya tha ki sansad main pesh bill main prastaavon ke jariye graahakon ko atirikt suraksha dene ke saath-saath banking kshetra main adhik paardarshita laane kii koshish bhi kii jaaengi
 It is to be noted that after the introduction of the FRDI bill in Parliament, the Central Government had clarified that the bail-in provisions made in the FRDI Bill would not pose any threat to the deposits of the bank's customers
 kendra sarkaar ne inhen bhranti qaraar dete hue 11 agast 2017 ko loksabhaa main pesh echardiai bill ko sansad kii joint samiti ke vichaar ke liye bhej diya tha
 Hence the Parliamentary Joint Committee consulted all stakeholders on this bill
 joint samiti ne yah bhi jaanane kii koshish kii ki bainkon ke swasth or bank graahakon ke suraksha mandandon ko adhik majboot kaise kiya ja saktaa he
 According to the central government, at present, every customer of the bank is given a deposit up to Rs 1 lakh under the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation
 vahiin 1 lakh rupee se adhik ke diposit ko kisi tarah kii suraksha nahin di jaati or use asurakshit rindaata ke daawey ke samakaksh mana jaataa he
 Therefore, in the proposed bill, the central government had offered to increase the security norms for unsecured money along with the existing security
 kendra sarkaar kaa daawa he ki echardiai bill bank graahakon ke hiton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue taiyaar kiya gaya he jabaki anya jagahon par bel-in praavdhaanon main creditor or dipositor ke manjuuri kaa praavdhaan nahin rahata he
 At the same time, in the proposed law, no cuts have been proposed in the government's powers of financing and resolution of all banks, including government banks

 He said that India would not approach the UN Security Council on Azhar's issue and if there was any other way to enlist Azhar, the members of that powerful organization would have to find it out
 unhone is maamle par bharat or pakistan ke bich kisi anya desh ke madhyasth banane kii sambhaavna ko bhi khaarij kar diya

 But still there are some mistakes that men often make while wearing jeans
 1
 Men often mess with their length while wearing crop jeans
 crop genes kii lambaai yaa to ankal ke baraabar honi chahie yaa phir usase neeche
 The length of men's jeans should be taken care of
 ranbir kii bahan ne sonam ko diya ye gift2
 Men also mess around with light and dark colored jeans
 dark shed kii genes ko shaam yaa raat main pahananaa chahie
 Wearing light-weight jeans during the day makes our dressing sense look great
 lekin purush genes ke shed ko lekar bhi aisi galtiyaan karte rahete hai
 Why is the worship of peepal tree, what is special importance 3
 purushon kii genes lambi hone ke chalate aksar juute ke upar ikatthi ho jaati he jo dekhne main bahut buree lagati he
 If this happens to your jeans, then you should reduce its length
 aisa karne se genes dekhne main bhi acchhee lagegi or uski fitting bhi acchhee aegi
 4
 har koi apni fitting kii genes pahananaa chahta he phir chaahe mahila ho yaa purush
 But body fat men should not wear slim fit jeans
 aise purushon ko slim feet genes pahanane se bachanaa chahie
 Wearing slim fit jeans does not make them look attractive

 Dileep Pandey challenged the BJP and said, "if BJP feels that corruption has not happened, then BJP should show North Delhi Municipal Corporation Mayor Preeti Agarwal by re-appointing her as Mayor and if BJP does not repeat Preity Agarwal If it does, should it be assumed that the BJP has cheated the people of Delhi in the name of a new face and a new flight? BJP believes that it has betrayed the people for which BJP apologizes to the people of Delhi

 INPUT-IANS uttarakhand kii tees fisadi aabaadi kii aarthik ridh kahi jane vaali chardhaam yatra ko sarkaar ne is baar sheetkaal ke dauraan bhi jari rakhane kaa nirnay liya he
 This is the first step taken in the history of Chardham Yatra till date
 2011 main bijepi sarkaar ne bhi aisi koshish kii thi, lekin taiyaariyon ke abhaav main vah puri nahin ho pai
 After the disaster in Kedarnath in June last year, the number of pilgrims coming to Chardham this year had come down by 60%
 isse yatra par ashrith vyapaariyon, sthaneey vyavsaayiyon or nivaasiyon ke saamne aajeevika kaa sankat khadaa ho gaya
 There is also a steep decline in offerings to temples
 aamadani kam hone se mandiron ke takreeban 325 karmchaariyon ko vetan ke laale pad gaye hai
 The salaries of the employees are being paid from the Kedarnath and Badrinath temple funds
 badrikedaar mandir samiti ke adhyaksh ganesh godiyal kehete hai, ''teen-chaar saal yahi sthiti rahi to surakshit kosh bhi khatm ho jayega
 In view of these problems, the government has stepped up efforts to bring the yatra back to its old form
 isiilie sheetkaal main bhi yatra jari rakhane kaa faisla kiya gaya he
 Chief Minister Harish Rawat says, "through the yatra, the government wants to attract 40 lakh tourists-pilgrims
" isse logon kii aajeevika kaa rasta khulegaa
 Before taking this decision, the government held a state cabinet meeting in Kedarnath
 mandiron se jude teerthpurohiton, pujaariyon or panda samaaj ke pratinidhiyon kii sahmati se yah faisla kiya gaya
 There is a mixed reaction among other political parties regarding this decision of the government
 mukhya vipakshi party bijepi ke netaa kedarnath main hui baithak main nahin pahunche or cabinet baithak ko nautanki qaraar diya
 bjp's Leader of Opposition Ajay Bhatt says, "it would have been nice if the state government had spent this money to rebuild the lives of those devastated by the Kedar tragedy
" '' bhatta kii is tippanee ke jawaab main rajya sarkaar ke pravaktaa surendra agarwal kehete hai, ''bijepi ne 2011 main aisi hi koshish kii thi, lekin vah asafal rahi
 Now Congress is making this effort
 isamen bijepi kaa aitraaj nazaij he kyonki isse unke prayaason kii kami logon ke saamne aa jaaegi
 The Chardham Yatra is completed by visiting Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri Dham

 However, the ports of Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri are now closed
 badrinaath ke kapaat 27 november ko band ho jaaenge
 All these places have been snowed twice
 mukhyamantri ne tirthayatriyon ko chaaron dham ke sheetkaal pravassthal tak surakshit le jane ke liye teenon jilon ke jila prashasan ko jaruri nirdesh die hai
 Uttarkashi, Chamoli and Rudraprayag have submitted their demands in this regard to the government
 sarkaar ne yatra maarg vaali sadakon kaa surveykshan karaayaa he
 The survey of Transport and Police Department has identified 125 sensitive places, where there is a risk of landslides due to narrowing of the road
 sardiyon main pahaado par paala bhi jaanaleva hota he
 The two directions of the mountain are classified in terms of sunlight
 jis hisse par dhoop rahati he, vah verde said ke rup main chinhit he
 Where the sun is less, it has been called Wind Word Side
 haalanki sheetkaal ke dauraan yatra main shradghaluon ko pahaad kii barfbaari ke jo najaare milenge, ve yaadgaar ho sakate hai
 Provided they have the ability to tolerate cold
 rishikesh se pandukeshwar kii 274 kilometre kii duuri tay karne ke baad pandukeshwar or govindghat main paanch hajaar logon ke thaharne kaa intjaam kiya gaya haishitkaal main in dhaamon main tirthayatri aaen, iske liye desh ke sabhi sadhu-santon se sarkaar ne nivedan kiya he ki ve apane samarthakon ko yatra par bhejein
 Also message them that this trip is completely safe

 The film 'rowdy Rathore' was released
 akshay kumaar isamen shiva naam ke chor bane hai jo paro yani sonakshi sinha ke pyaar main pad jate hai lekin ek din kahani main aata he tivest
 
 
 
 jab gundon kii badi fouj shiva ko khatm karne par tul jaati he
 a missing child starts calling Shiva as 'papa'
 to kya maamla hamshakl kaa he vaise yah koi bada suspence nahin he
 This is another action film by 'wanted' director Prabhu Deva, but where 'wanted' runs at a fast pace
 
 
 
 While there was a tight film, 'rowdy Rathore' has a comedy in the first half, which laughs in pieces
 iske bich akshay or sonakshi kii romantic chemistry main dam nahin dikhataa
 Sonakshi has lost the flexibility and elegance of the heroine with the increased weight after domination
 tippaniyan The action begins a little before the second half and continues till the end
 bina shaq akshay ne josh dilaane vaale kai jabardast ection seens kiye hai jaise dashahara par roudi par waar karata hua ravan yaa bhari barish main fite seens lekin ection kaa overdoj film ko lambaa or ubaau bana detaa he
 Steeped in elements like suspense, comedy, action, injustice and revenge, the film is a commercial masala film that seeks to pull in single-screen audiences
 zyaadaatar gane or item number bhi tapori chhap hai
 Music also sounds heard
 kul milakar yah ek everej film he or iske liye meri reating he 2
 5 stars
 'wonted' ke diarector prabhu deva kii yah ek or ection film he lekin jahaan 'wonted' tej gati se bhaagti
 
 
 
 kasi hui film thi vahiin 'roudi rathore' main first half main kamedi he jo tukdon-tukdon main hansaati he
 Between this, Akshay and Sonakshi's romantic chemistry does not show strength
 dabang ke baad bade hue vajan ke saath sonakshi ne heroin ke lacheelepan or najaakat ko kho diya he
