 Kangana Runot's film 'tanu Weds Manu Returns' has proved to be a superhit
 kangana ke role kii bollywood ne kaaphi saraahna kii he
 Big stars like Big b write praise letters
 pichley kuch saalon main bollywood main kisi actress kii image kaa mekaover hua he, to wo kangana hai
 Let's know some special things about Kangana's heart, how she feels about her relationship with Bollywood and how challenging her roles are
 1
 Datto's role in 'tanu Weds Manu Returns' was quite challenging
 tanu ko to darshakon ne pehle bhi dekha tha
 Everyone was aware of his carefree and cool image
 lekin datto ek simple hariyaanvi ladki he
 She does not even do makeup
 banno gane ke hisaab se wo ek dehathan he
 But i like Tanu as well as Datto
 2
 The audience first liked the character of Rani (in Queen)
 phir datto bhi sabko khub bhai
 It showed me that people want to see Raw and Natural characters
 kuch aisa jisase wo apni nijee jindagi ko jodakar dekh saken
 3
 18 saal kii umr main 'gangster' se cinema jagat main entry, phir 2008 main 'fishan' ke liye aword, phir 2014 main 'queen' ke liye aword, or ab 'tanu vaids manu riterns' ko 100 karod ke club main pahunchaana yah safar aasaan nahin tha
 But Kangana no longer needs a superhit co-actor to make a picture hit
 unhen industry main kisi mail actor se insecurity nahin he
 4
 kangana maanati hanki kisi jamaane main bollywood main ladakiyon ke bahut limited kirdaar hote the
 But the era is also changing
 ladkiyaan ab ejeeniyar hai, doctor hai, jarnlist hai
 She is venturing out into society, meaning new stories are also getting place in cinema
 5
 Kangana considers her 3 success spells, looking at her physical appearance to catch a role, working on her body language, and understanding her current situation
 kangana maanati hai ki ek role aapaki jindagi kaa ek hissaa le jaataa he or phir wo aapako waapas nahin miltaa
 She could not do a 'dirty picture' after doing 'fashion'
 6
 Kangana describes herself as a very big fan of Madhubala
 agar mauka miltaa, to unke saath wo kisi film main screen bhi share karatin
 According to Kangana, Madhubala was very beautiful and innocent
 7
 Along with learning English, Kangana is also working on her accent
 bina hichkichaate or sharamaate hue wo bataati hai ki wo ek badi audiyans ke saath communicket karnaa chaahati hai
 Earlier, when she went abroad, she could not even ask for water properly from anyone
 8
 When Kangana was asked what she would do if she had a daughter like him, Kangana responded by laughing that she would retire
 9
 The industry's mail stars also think many times before working with them
 sabko dar he ki kangana film main kahin unka role na kha jaaen
 Kangana is shooting for a film with Irrfan Khan
 vahaan irfan ne unase kaha ki ek myaan main 2 talavaarein kaise rahengi? is baat ko kangana ne apane liye ek compcement samajha ki irfan unhen apana pratidwandi maanate hai
 10
 filmon ke alaava kangana ek course kar kheti siikhnaa bhi chaahati hai
 She wants to grow all things like carrots
 'aashirwad', bollywood ke pehle superstar kaa ashiana
 But now this gharonda is caught in legal issues

 According to Anita, Kaka and Anita were together for the last eight years
 anitha unheen ke saath aashirwad main rahati thi
 But ever since Rajesh Khanna's health worsened, the practice of evicting him from home was started
 isi ke chalate anitha adwani ne dhara 19 ke tahat khanna parivaar ko notice bhej diya he
 Anita also claims that she knew Rajesh Khanna since childhood and is his friend since then
 haalanki kaaka ne anitha se rishte kii baat nahin kabuuli thi
 In an interview given to a newspaper in 2011, Rajesh Khanna had said, "I have known Anita for years but the matter has not reached love yet
" '70 ke dashak main mumbai ke carter road par bane is bangale ko rajesh khanna ne 'hathi mere saathi' kii kamai se kharida tha
 Even today, for the fans of Rajesh Khanna, this bungalow is a temple, which is also being talked about to build a museum, but now that the house is not stuck in legal complications
 rajesh khanna kii antim ichha thi ki unke baad unka bangala aashirwad myusium main tabdeel kar diya jaae
 The blessing was bought by Rajesh Khanna from Rajendra Kumar
 rajesh khanna ne ek intervyuu main kaha tha, 'main chahta hum ki aashirwad main rajesh khanna myusium bane
 My daughters have houses
 unhen meri sampatti kii jarurat nahin he
 But the final decision will have to be taken by them as their legacy will remain in their hands after me

 Votes will also be counted on 1 December
 bijepi ne upi ke in nikaay chunaavon main 187 muslim chehron par daanv khelaa he jinamein se adhiktar mahilaayein hai
 It is surprising that not only for the election of the councilor, but the BJP has also fielded Muslim faces for 19 city council president posts, of which 15 are women
 ye vahi bijepi he jisane is saal ke shuru main uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main ek bhi muslim ummidavaar maidan main nahin utaara tha
 In fact, the BJP is already engaged in putting up political folds for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi kheme main ye kavayad or charchaa zyada he ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main musalamaanon kaa koun sa tabaka unhen vot karegaa
 The Shia community's votes in Uttar Pradesh have been getting the BJP to some extent, but now the party is trying to get more and more Muslim women voters together to expand its reach
 upi ke is nikaay chunaav ke dauraan muslim bahul ilaakon main bhi bijepi ke jhande-postaron ke saath party ke netaa galiyon main prachaar karte dekhe gaye
 In such areas, the leaders of Jambijpk used to visit very rarely
 vahaan naa sirf party ke daftar khule balki bijepi ke muslim chehre dhadlle se sabhaayen bhi karte najar aae
 up's only Muslim minister, Mohsin Raza, held a large number of meetings in Muslim-dominated areas
 tang galiyon se lekar chote kasbon tak bijepi netaaon ko sunne ke liye log bhi jute
 It is a different matter that how many of these listeners get converted into votes
 1 disambar konikaay chunaavake nateezon main ye saaf ho jayega
 But it is so sure that BJP has definitely registered its presence even in Muslim majority areas
 nikaay chunaavon main rampur, amroha, sitapur, bareli lakhimpur, muradabad, saharanpur sareekhe jilon main, jahaan musalamaanon kii khaasaa taadaad he, BJP ne jamkar muslim ummidavaaron ko maidan main utaara
 Apart from Muslim majority districts, BJP has given tickets to 4 Muslims in Lucknow and 3 in Varanasi
 lakhanu main party ke 4 muslim ummidavaaron main 2 mahilaayein hai jabaki varanasi main 3 ummidavaaron main se 2 muslim mahilaenchunavamein kismat aajamaa rahi hai

 shabbiri begum kaa kahana he ki ve chunaav jeet kar dikhaaengi ki unhen hindu or musalmaan, sabhi kaa samarthan hasil he
 Voters of Shabiri Begum area also say about her that she has been associated with social service for many years
 lakhimpur khiri ke hidaayat nagar ke ward number 26 se farjaana begum BJP kii ummidavaar hai
 Farzana says that PM Narendra Modi has got relief from triple talaq, in such a large section of Muslim women will vote in his name
 is ilaake kii mahilaayein bhi farjaana ke sur main sur milaati najar ain
 up's Minority Affairs Minister Mohsin Raza, who has campaigned extensively for the BJP in Muslim areas, says that this time the eyes of Muslims are also going towards the BJP because the BJP has set up the organization with its flag banner in every street
 
 mohsin raja ke mutabik ye taiyaari sirf 2019 kii nahin balki bijepi ko musalamaanon ke dilon tak le jane kii he
 Two phases of body elections have passed and the last phase of election campaign has also ended
 ab 29 november ko aakhri charan kaa chunaav hona he
 How many of the bjp's 187 Muslim candidates will win, it will be clear from the results on 1 December
 lekin jis tareeke se bijepi ne nikaay chunaav ke liye muslim ummidavaar chehron main mahilaon ko tarjeeh di he, usase tay he ki 2019 loksabhaa chunaav tak wo musalamaanon main bhi apane liye ek vot bank khadaa hote dekhnaa chaahati he

 But this contest is not up to par as the victory is usually of drunken elephants
 ye adivasee is ilaake main bahutayat main hone vaale mahua se sharaab banaate hai
 Every family is allowed to make five liters of liquor
 mahua se sharaab banane or pine kii tarah hi haathiyon kaa utpaat jhelana bhi adivaasiyon kii jindagi kaa hissaa ban chukaa he
 Every year, as the summer comes, the intoxicating smell of Mahua brings tremendous destruction to the villages around Jashpur forests and Jharkhand and Odisha have to bear the brunt of it
 pichley ku chha dinon se darjanon haathiyon ne jashpur ke gaanvon ko apana nishaanaa bana rakhaa he, unhen mashaalon, pataakhon or dhol-nagaadon ke shor kii bhi koi parvaah nahin he
 Mast elephants break the mud houses and drink the liquor of Mahua placed there and then proceed
 or peeche rah jate hai apni ankhon ke saamne hui tabaahi ko dekh apni bebasii par rote adivasee log
 As the water of the forest dries up in the summer months and the trees and plants also decrease, elephants start moving towards human settlements in search of water and food
 vahaan rakhi mahua kii sharaab nasha kara hi detii he
 But the government is more concerned about elephants than humans
 9 april ko haathiyon ne kunkari gaanv main 5 saal kii annu bai ko kuchal diya tha or ek anya bacchee ko ghayal kar diya tha
 There have been more than 40 elephant attacks in Jashpur in the last one month

 a senior forest official says that the illegal cutting of trees and shrinking forests in Jharkhand and Odisha has forced elephants to come towards Chhattisgarh
 chhattisgarh ke van mantri vikram usendi ne vidhansabha main bataaya ki 2010 se ab tak haathiyon ke hamale se 82 logon kii maut ho chuki he
 Since 1994, these elephants have been coming towards Jashpur, Raigad, Surguja, Korba and Korea in northern Chhattisgarh
 inamen se kuch to jharkhand or orissa laut gaye par 150 se adhik haathiyon ne chhattisgarh ke jangalon main hi deraa daal liya he
 Chief Wildlife Conservator Ram Prakash says that these elephants come to human settlements in search of water and food
 ve bataate hai, ‘‘bans, falon or aisi duusari chizon ke ped lagaae ja rahe hai jinase inkaa jangal main hi pet bhar jaae or ye insaani bastiyon kii taraf na aaen
 Ponds and ponds are also being built in the forest to quench their thirst
 ’’ram prakaash ke mutabik, gaanvvaalon ko ab mitti ke tel sahit duusari saamagree bhi di ja rahi he jisaki madad se ve haathiyon ko apni bastiyon se dur rakh saken
 He says that the situation is slowly improving
 hamalon main marane waalon kii taadaad main tehraav aane se pataa lagata he ki insaan or hathi saath milakar rahanaa sikh rahe hai
 In the early 1990s there used to be only 25-30 elephants, 27–30 people died every year in their attacks
 pichley kuch varshon main mritkon kii sankhya main bahut adhik badhotaree nahin hui he
 Since 2003, less than a dozen elephants have died in this war between humans and elephants

 i want to remind you aapane bijepi ke netritv kii sarkaar bhi dekhi he
 Not even one day in six years under Atal ji's rule, inflation in the history of independent India was allowed to increase
 aaj main yah bhi kahana chahta hum ki hamaara ye bihar aisa rajya he
 Where 85 percent of the population lives in villages
 inaki garibi or berogari ko koi dur kar saktaa he, to bijepi kii sarkaar hi dur kar sakati he
 We know that in the wide streets of India Delhi, Mumbai
 oonchi imaaraton main nahin rahata he
 This village lives in the street, when it will develop, then the dream will come true
 main sabko bharosa dilaanaa chahta hum ki jis din bijepi kii sarkaar aegi, us din sabase bada utpaadak, upabhokta jo kisaan he, ham uski haalat sudhaarney kii, uski kray shakti badhaane ke liye kaam karenge
 If there is money in the pocket of the farmer, then the business of the merchant will run
 dukandaar kii dukaan chalegi
 Doctor's doctor will work
 vakil kii vakaalat chalegi
 The whole of India will run
 aapako yah bhi bataanaa chahta hum ki atal ji kii sarkaar main main krishi mantri bane
 i requested atal ji maan gaye
 Earlier farmers used to get interest at 14 to 20 percent rate for farming
 maine kaha ki yah kahaan kaa insaaf he
 Atal ji said, reduce it
 pehali baar saadhe aath fisadi kii dar par kisaan rin kiya gaya
 Then the BJP formed a government in the states, then reduced it further
 aaj hamaari madhyapradesh samet kai sarkarein, shunya fisadi dar par karj de rahi hai kisaanon ko
 No one in the world can imagine this
 main aapako bharosa dilaanaa chahta hum ki ye formula kyon jaruri he
 Sometimes there is a drought in Bihar
 isiilie hamane tay kiya he ki khet kii buvaai ke pahel kisaan kii khet kii aamadani tay kerani chahie
 If the crop is lost, the farm income that has been fixed before sowing should be repaid by the government machinery
 ham kisaan kii mali haalat sudhaarenge
 If we want to make India an economic superpower, it is necessary
 lekin yah congress kii sarkaar jo 55 saalon se hukumat kar rahi he
 a new record of corruption is being created which our PM lays hands on
 aalu par haath rakhaa
 disappeared
 koyala khadaanon kii file par haath rakh diya
 The file disappeared
 aise desh ke pradhanmantri hai
 The old lady, who lived in such a village, went to the PM when she came to know that the person on whom she had laid her hand was missing
 manmohan singh ne padhaa to samaj aayaa ki budhiya ke qamar main dard he
 PM said give it one lakh
 usne manaa kar diya
 Give two lakhs phir manaa kar diya
 So, Dr
 Manmohan Singh asked what you want
 budhiya ne kaha, maine suna he, aap jis par haath rakh dete hai
 He disappears
 to meri peeth main bahut dard he
 Put your hands on it, the pain will go away
 main sibiai ke logon se kahana chahta hum
 You cannot say anything to the Prime Minister
 vah kuch bolenge hi nahin, to aap puuchhenge kaise
 a crown prince says
 ki daadi ko logon ne maar daalaa, pita ko maar daalaa
 Now i will kill you too
 are main kahana chahta hum ki kya ho gaya he, janata kaa dil netritv karne vaala shere dil hona chahie, narendra modi kii tarah hona chahie
 You have SPG protection
 agar aapaki jaan ko khatra he, to desh kii sena kii batalian apni suraksha main laga lo
 But don't cry for public, try to exploit his spirit
 main aapako yakeen dilaanaa chahta hum ki bijepi samaaj ke sabhi virgon ko saath lekar chalanaa chaahati he
 People of Bihar, promise you that 40 of the 40 seats will go to BJP
 (rajnath singh kaa bhaashan samaapt)gauratlab he ki pracheen kaal main satta kaa singhaasana jis patliputra yani patna main sajata tha, aaj vahaan nae sire se satta kii siyasat ke do ahm mohare apni apni chaalon ke saath aamane saamne hai

 aise main yah hunkaar paramparaagat rajnatik virdohi lalu prasad yadav ke mukaable jediu ke netaa or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke khilaaf zyada he
 It was Nitish Kumar whose insistence that the BJP could not bring Narendra Modi to Bihar till now
 magar ab rishte raar main badal chuke hai or bihar bijepi modi raag ke sahare apane sur sanvaarane kii taiyaari main he
 If you are preparing to come to Kashmir then go early, because Asia's largest tulip garden has been opened to the general public from today
 jaldi kii baat isliye ki 60 se adhik prajatiyon ke 15 lakh ke kareeb phulon kaa didaar karne se kahin aap chook na jaaen
 Flowers have started blooming in this tulip garden on the banks of Jabarwan Hill, on the banks of the world-famous Dal Lake
 ye khubasurat garden aath hectare kshetra main failaa he
 This time efforts have been made to give the garden a new look so that more and more tourists come to see it
 vaise to dal jhil kaa itihaas sadiyon purana he, par tulip garden ko bane keval saat saal hue he

 dal jhil ke saamne ke ilaake main sirajbag main bane tulip garden main aap tulip kii 60 se adhik prajatiyaan ek saath dekh sakate he
 Perhaps this is the reason why people do not hesitate to pay the fees kept for the walk of the garden
 sirajbag haravaan-shalimaar or nishat chashmaashahee ke bich kii jameen par kareeb 700 kanal aria main failaa hua he
 It is a three-phase project, under which it is to be added to 1360 and 460 kanals of land in the next phase
 shuru-shuru main ise shiraji baag ke naam se pukaara jaataa tha
 In fact, it was named after the head of the Garden Department during the time of the Maharaja
 par ab yah shiraj baag ke sthaan par tulip garden ke naam se adhik janaa jane laga he
 The white, yellow, blue, red and pink tulip flowers that bloom in the Tulip Garden today are coping with the flowers that bloom in Holland
 phool premi yahaan aakar holland jaisaa hi mahasoos karte he
 Kashmir is the only place in India where tulips disperse from March to the end of May
 yah sach he ki abhi tak kashmir main dal jhil or mughal garden, shalimaar baag, nishat or chashmaashahee hi aane waalon ke aakarshan ke centre the or kashmir duniyabar main inke liye hi mashhoor tha
 Now in the list of these names, the name of Tulip Garden has also been added

 '' Comments kapil ne kaha, ‘‘maine kabhi bhi bisisiai kaa niraadar nahin kiya he or yah hameshaa hi meri mul sanstha rahegi

 The Ayodhya and Babri Masjid cases are being sought to be resolved by mediation following the Supreme Court's directive

 During the hearing on 14 appeals filed against the 2010 decision of the Allahabad High Court to distribute 77 acres of land equally between the three parties - Sunni Waqf Board, Nirmohi Akhara and Ramlala, it was suggested to explore the possibility of resolving the dispute through arbitration

 Nirmohi Akhada had filed a fresh petition in the Supreme Court and this petition opposed the plea of the Central Government to give back the additional land acquired in Ayodhya
 akhaada ne kaha tha ki supreme court ko pehle bhoomi vivaad kaa faisla karnaa chahie
 The acquisition of land by the center destroyed many temples run by the arena
 aise main centre ko ye jameen kisi ko bhi waapas karne ke liye nahin di ja sakati
 The arena also said that Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas cannot be given majority land in Ayodhya
 akhaada ne ye yachika centre sarkaar kii janvari kii yachika par daakhil kii thi jisamen supreme court se maang kii gai thi ki wo vivaadit bhoomi ke alaava adhigrahit kii gai jameen ko waapas lautaanaa chahta he

 Three months have passed when Jairam Ramesh was removed from the Ministry of Environment, giving a headline daily, to the Ministry of Rural Development
 ve is ubaau mantralay ko media kii najaron main tadak-bhadak vaala karnama banane ke liye din-raat mehnat karte aae hai
 But luck did not support him very much
 zyaadaatar surkhiyaan unhen gachha de jaati hai or kai baar unhen unase chin liya gaya
 On 20 October, Ramesh was asked to receive Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on a 15-minute quick tour of the Three Bigha corridor
 is avasar ko jhpatane ke liye betaab ramesh ne bangla main bhaashan bhi taiyaar kar liya jise roman main likhaa gaya tha
 But at the last moment, he was told that he was being sent to Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad
 jaahir he, pradhanmantri karyaalay chahta tha ki videshi mehmaan kaa swaagat koi 'varisht' mantri kare
 Despite not being in the order of priority, Ramesh has risen very fast in the cabinet
 upie 1 main pehali baar mantri banane ke baad ve upie 2 main cabinet mantri ban gaye
 It was not easy to ignore him in the Ministry of Environment
 mantrimandal main apane aadhe sahyogiyon or pej thri ke udyogpatiyon ko apane saath lene ke kaaran variyata kaa sawaal kabhi nahin uthaa
 His new office does not have as many big people as he used to in his old ministry
 na hi koi mjedaar vivaad hota he
 Soon after Ramesh was sent to the Ministry of Rural Development by giving him cabinet status, Manmohan Singh said, "jayaram has been given more responsibility, where his talent will be better utilized
" '' pradhanmantri pahelidaar jumale kehane ke liye mashhoor nahin hai, lekin baat ramesh kii ho to ve isaki koshish karte hai
 He did not elaborate on how Ramesh's talent would be used
 lekin unhen ek aise mantralay main bhejkar, jo congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi kii kuch pasandida pariyojnaon-bhoomi adhigrahan evam punarvaas vidheyak or mahatma gandhi gramin rojgaar guarantee kanoon (manaregaa)-ko dekhtaa he, manmohan ne chaturaai se yah tay kar diya he ki ramesh ab rahul kii jamaat kaa hissaa hai
 Even though the outspoken Ramesh can no longer make headlines, he still gets an a grade to try
 unhone apane nae karyaalay main hare rang kaa paint karaayaa he, lakdi ke daravaaje kii jagah shishe kaa darwaja lagavaaya he
 But there was no discussion of these things
 iske baad unhone apni ek pasandida puraani trick kaa sahaara liya, yani samasamyik bahes main kud padane kaa, khaskar aise makasad se judi bahes main jisaki vakaalat yaa to congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi yaa unke bete rahul karte hon
 At a recent award ceremony, he expressed his views about the RTI Act
 is kanoon par phir se gaur karne kii sambhaavna kaa sankawt dene vaale pradhanmantri se dillagi ke andaaj main bhidate hue unhone kaha, ''kuch mantri samajhte hai ki artiai sambandhi sawaalon ko nibatane main unka bahut samay barbaad hota he
 This is not an excuse to soften this law
 '' badakismati se, behatar vibhaagon main jame unke kuch or sahyogiyon ke mukaable media ne artiai ke bare main gramin vikaas mantri ke vichaaron kii taraf utana dhyaan nahin diya
 Team Anna was very keen that Ramesh be part of the government team during the talks in may-june
 lekin unhen shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 But they did not stop
 23 agast ko ramlila sankat ke dauraan unhone yah elaan kar apane zyaadaatar sahyogiyon ko chaunkaa diya ki ve lok seva shikaayat nivaaran vidheyak par kaam karenge
 This was also one of Team Anna's demands, but this responsibility falls under the Ministry of Personnel
 ramesh ne kaha ki unase haalanki iskaa masauda taiyaar karne ko nahin kaha gaya he, par ve kul 42 din ke apane manaregaa ke tajurbe ke aadhaar par ise taiyaar kar rahe hai
 If the government does not find their draft useful, they will use it to curb corruption in their ministry
 yahi vajah he ki kam hi sahyogi unhen team kaa khilaadi maanate hai

 bhoomi adhigrahan evam punarvaas vidheyak ko rahul kii ore se mil rahi ahmiyat ko samajhte hue unhone 12 july ko mantralay kaa charge sanbhaalane ke baad record do hafte ke samay main vidheyak taiyaar kar diya
 He also called for Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati and also wrote a letter to her on complaints about corruption in the state's MNREGA schemes
 ve sabhi chaalen jaanate hai
 But what they are doing, because of not getting the glare of the media, it means to go in the dark
 unka ek or kaam masauda vidheyak ko website par daalana tha
 This gave him the support of civil society activists who complained that most bills go directly from the Ministry to the Cabinet and then to Parliament
 aam taur par vidheyak sthaayee samiti ke paas bheje jane ke baad janata ke raay-mashvire ke liye die jate hai

 manaregaa ke tahat unhone bahut kuch nayaa haath main nahin liya he, lekin ve aise kaam karne kii koshish kar rahe hai jinhen amali jama pahanaaya ja saktaa he
 The real challenge is to ensure that they are implemented fully
 '' baharhaal, saamaajik kaaryakartaaon kii tushti kaa kaam posco or lavasa se do-do haath karne jaisaa nahin he
 There is neither fun nor publicity in it

 He is doing more meaningful work in his new ministry
 par vah itnaa dilachasp nahin he
 In a recent National Development Council meeting, when Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal complained about the destruction of wild animal crops and suggested that the work of expelling them be included in MNREGA schemes, Ramesh did not like it
 
 baad main mantri badbadaae, ''ab ye log chaahate hai ki bandaron ko bhagane ke liye manaregaa kaa istemaal kiya jaae
 "of course, Ramesh did not think of himself or about his ministry's flagship plan

 ED said- do not excuse passport Mallyabha government has rejected Malkyaka passport and during the hearing of the case, Mallya's lawyer said that he wants to come to court but cannot come to India because of not having passport
 iske jawaab main idi ne court ko bataaya ki maalya agar bharat aana chahen to kanoon me aise praavdhaan hai ki apatkaaleen halaat main kisi vyakti ko aane kii ijaajat di ja sakati he
 'mallya did not contact Indian Embassy' The court has currently given Mallya's lawyer some more time to look into the legal documents to see how Mallya can come to India
 haalanki idi kii taraf se kaha gaya he ki agar maalya bharat aana chaahate hai to wo bhartiya duutavas se sampark kar sakate hai
 But Mallya has not yet made any contact with the embassy

 vah is relationships ko or aage nahin badhanaa chaahati hai
 And now that they are separated from this relationship, there is nothing left to talk about again
 yah brallep manish ke liye kisi jatke se kam nahin tha
 Manish himself wrote the past in a 6-page letter
 sachin tendulkar or rekha bataur rajya sabha sadsy apane kaarykaal main sansad ke aakhri satr main dikhaai de sakate hai
 Provided there is no compulsion of cricket or film in front of them
 aisa isliye ki apane 6 saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan donon ne sansad ke hue sabhi satron main mahaj ek yaa do din sadan main maujuud rahe
 This presence also remained so that his Rajya Sabha membership remained constant
 lekin jahaan tak sansad main kisi saansad kii jimmedaari kaa sawaal uthta he to donon ne apane kaarykaal ke dauraan sawaal poochna, jawaab dena or kanoon banane ke kaam ko koi tarjeeh nahin di
 Did the two, who were nominated to Parliament 6 years ago, fulfill the objective? 6 years of Rekha as a member in Rajya Sabha Rekha did not ask a single question during the 6-year tenure, if you look at the figures on the Rajya Sabha website
 jaahir he jab sawaal nahin poocha to kendra sarkaar dwaara unase koi samvaad nahin kiya gaya
 When an MP asks a question in the House, it is answered by the Central Government and that question is recorded in the Register of Parliament and also updated on the Rajya Sabha website
 haalanki aisa nahin he ki sansad kii taraf se rekha ko sadan ke kaamkaaj main shaamil karne kii koi pahal nahin kii gai
 Rekha was inducted as a member of the Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution from September 2016
 is samiti main rekha ke kisi tarah ke yogadan kaa byora sansad ke paas nahin he, jaahir he yahaan bhi unhone kuch bhi kehane-sunne kii jarurat nahin samajhi
 Read this: There was a loud uproar in the two houses of Parliament on the PNB scam, the adjournment of the proceedings
 Rekha always made headlines in the film world
 lekin rajyasabha ke unke kaarykaal ke dauraan kabhi sansad main unke naam kaa zikr bhi nahin kiya gaya
 Why is it even mentioned when he never tried to do anything in the role of MP
 sansad main sawaal poochne ke alaava saansad dwaara koi bill laana uski jimmedaari kaa ahm hissaa he
 But Rekha did not introduce a single bill in Parliament during her entire tenure
 ab ant main rekha kii sadan main maujuudagi kaa aankada bataa rahaa he ki sabhi manonith sadasyon main unki atendence sabase kharaab rahi he
 During her tenure, she was included in 18 sittings in total 373 sittings of Parliament held till August 2017
 yani puure kaarykaal ke dauraan unki kul atendence mahaj 5 fisadi rahi
 Rekha gave an application to not attend the session of the House only once and explained the reason for not being able to work in the film
 haalanki kuch satron se vah bina aplicoshan die gaayab raheen
 However, Rekha took such care during her tenure that her membership remained for the entire term
 sansad ke niyam ke mutabik yadi koi saansad sansad ke kaamkaaj se lagaataar 60 dinon tak bina soochna gaayab rahata he ko uski sadsyta khatm kiye jane kaa praavdhaan he
 But Rekha's attendance never went against this rule of 60 days and she continued to get the facilities of the MP for the entire term
 rajyasabha main bataur sadsy sachin ke 6 saljahan tak sansad main sawaal poochne kaa adhikaar he to sachin tendulkar kaa record rekha se bahut behatar he
 In response to Rekha's zero questions, there are 22 questions in Sachin's record, whose details have been included on the Rajya Sabha website
 unke sawaal railway network ke electriffication, new ajukeshan policy main sports ko bataur vishay shaamil karnaa or railway suraksha jaise vishyon par kendrit rahe
 In response to these questions of Sachin, the Central Government has also answered the questions of making Yoga and sports as school subjects and sports compulsory subject
 sachin ke jin sawaalon ke jawaab sarkaar dwaara die gaye unhen sachin ne disambar 2015 main puche the
 He was also made a member of the Committee on Information Technology on behalf of Parliament in 2016, although the details of his contribution to this committee have not been released by the Parliament
 vahiin unke kaarykaal ke dauraan rajyasabha main unke naam par bhi kabhi koi charchaa nahin kii gai
 Read this: Cashless society was cheated, the entire currency before demonetisation came back in circulation, as far as the attendance register of Parliament is concerned, Sachin's attendance line was not as bad but his attendance can not be called good
 sachin ke kaarykaal main agast 2017 tak sansad ke kul 373 sittings main vah 25 sittings main shaamil rahe hai
 That is, Sachin's attendance was 7 percent
 rekha kii tarj par sachin ne bhi apane kaarykaal ke dauraan itani saavdhaanee barti ki unki sadsyta par kabhi khatra nahin paidaa hua
 During his 6-year tenure, Sachin attended one to two days in almost all sessions of Parliament and never disappeared for 60 consecutive days during the session of Parliament
 vahiin sachin 6 saal ke dauraan 3 baar sansad ko soochna dete hue gaayab rahe or iske liye sachin ne cricket match or kaarobaari vyastata kaa hawala diya

 Aam Aadmi Party convenor, former Chief Minister of Delhi and current contender Arvind Kejriwal took so much time to muster up the courage to attack Narendra Modi even in the Jubani war after the humiliating defeat in the general election all over the country at the hands of Narendra Modi
 That is how long the attack on Kiran Bedi will start
 
 
 udhar, party ke varisht netaa or ab tak narendra modi ke bade prashansakon main se ek kumaar vishwaas jise jayachand kii oopaadhi de rahe hai, yani shajia ilmi, vah bhi party main aa rahi hai
 In such a situation, the edge of the weapons used by the party in the election campaign, little or no, is bound to have a huge impact
 party ke hi kai log kah rahe hai ki bheetar kii kuch baaten baahar to aaengi or shajia se aisi ummid party kar rahi he
 The way Shazia is openly claiming in interviews, it looks like this
 'aap' ke tamaam purv netaaon kii tarah shajia bhi kejariwal ko pehle hi taanashaah ke samaan bataa chuki hai
 
 
 On the other hand, the present party of the party has been issuing all statements to deny it and will still waste time doing the same
 dilli main kiran bedi ke bijepi main shaamil hone ke saath hi sab ke sab ek sur main kehane lage hai ki bijepi ne aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejariwal ke khilaaf apana brahmastra chalaa diya he
 That is, the BJP has nothing left in Delhi's answer to Kejriwal
 kiran bedi ko aisa kyon kaha ja rahaa he
 
 
 Kejriwal and BJP have been able to tell all the similarities and differences between them
 
 
 apane-apane vishleshan de rahe hai
 
 
 Some are saying that Kejriwal will have problems with BJP now
 kathith jaankaar to yah bhi kah rahe hai ki kejariwal ke kheme main ab kuch halchal much gai he
 Many people have started feeling that whatever campaigning was done till now, whether it was done after the name of Jagdish Mukhi, has been done after the name of Satish Upadhyay, in the last election, it was done with Vijay Goyal, with Vijender Gupta
 Gaya, all propaganda, all weapons have failed
 
 
 ab kiran bedi ke khilaaf kya bolkar hamalaa karenge
 Which will bring a corruption case? 
 
 kiran bedi, pehle anna kii team main thim, jisamen kejariwal bhi shaamil the
 At the same time as the pressure on the government increased during the demonstration at Ramlila Maidan, at the same time Kejriwal and all the members of the current team had come forward to respond to the allegations of corruption against Kiran Bedi, and their honesty, unblemished image and efficiency and nationality And had been calling for loyalty to the society
 ab jab kiran bedi kaa aagaman bijepi main ho gaya he or vah yah sweekaar kar rahi hai ki party or piem modi ne un par kaaphi bharosa dikhaaya he, tab kejariwal or ab kii unki team ke chehre par shikan padana to laazmi hi he
 In the last assembly elections in Delhi, when the Aam Aadmi Party was being talked about, then the party could become the number two party
 ab jab modi lahar main puraa desh modimay hota ja rahaa he, aise main kejariwal kaa daawa ki vah 45 siton ke saath sarkaar banaaenge, zyada bade bol prathit ho rahe hai
 Kejriwal is trying to get a majority to form a government, but now he is sure to face problems
 
 
 modi factor se to vah pehle hi dare hue the, unke apane kai saathi yah maan bhi rahe the
 
 
 Two days ago, Kumar Vishwas, who praised Modi, has started appearing in the party's campaign
 kejariwal jahaan tamaam intervyuu main modi ke khilaaf bolne se bachate rahe hai, kai baar to vah modi par puche sawaalon par baukhala tak gaye or sawaalon ke jawaab main sawaal hi poochne lage
 
 
 At the same time, Kumar Vishwas launches the attack
 modi kaa bal yahi rahaa he ki aise hamalon par tavajjo nahin dete hai or apana kaam karte rahe hai or unki yahi baat logon ko pasand aati rahi
 Since May 2014 and now the Aam Aadmi Party has dared to attack Modi
 
 
 phir sochie kiran bedi par hamale kii himmat kitne dinon main juta paaegi
 
 
 Perhaps this is the reason that all the alleged experts are giving Kiran Bedi the title of 'brahmastra of BJP'

 ye kyli kii dress kii phek copy najar aati he
 Earlier, Urvashi wore a copy of Elie Saab dress

 samaajawaadee party kii kalah ko lekar jab har koi samaj rahaa tha ki ab samjhaute kii koi gunjaaish nahin bachi, thik usee vakt mulaayam singh ne khaas daanv chal kar duniya ko jataayaa ki ye mat bhuulo wo pahalwaan rahe hai
 Mulayam, who was a mastermind of the Dhobiphat bets, showed that wrestling is the rule, unless the wrestler himself leaves the arena, one should not rush to the conclusion
 itihaas gavaah he ki bhartiya raajnneeti ke akhaade main mulaayam aise pahalwaan hai, jinke bare main ye kayaas lagaana mushkil he ki wo aglaa daanv koun sa chalenge
 Has Mulayam read the writing on the wall and decided to leave the ground for his son? Or is it a trick of the legendary wrestler to defeat opponents? Or is it a matter of age that Netaji is seen as 'clock in tola, watch in masha'
 kya yahi vajah he ki mulaayam samaj nahin paa rahe hai ki unke lagaataar bayaan badalane ne kaise hansi kaa paatr bana diya he?mulaayam ne mangalvaar subah akhilesh ko baatcheet ke ek or daur ke liye nyotaa bheja
 Also announced that Akhilesh will be the chief ministerial candidate
 jaaniye wo koun si 5 vajah hai jinhone netaji ko dobaaraa mulaayam hone ke liye majaboor kiya
 1
 haashie par dhakel die janaamulaayam kii chhavi aise rashtriya netaa kii rahi he jisamen pradhanmantri banane kaa puraa madda tha
 At present, Mulayam's position is such that he has only three things to support - the constitution of Amar Singh, Shivpal Yadav and Samajwadi Party (which he never seems to care much)
 akhilesh ab party ke kaaryakartaaon or netaaon kii sarvasammat pasand hai
 In Akhilesh and Mulayam's tug of war, 90 percent of the party's leaders have made up their mind to get behind the young chief minister
 baaki jo bache hai wo bhi jaise hi samjhaute kii aakhri ummid bhi tuutati he to akhilesh kii naiya par savaar hone main tanik der nahin lagaayenge
 The socialist warriors of the electoral battle know that Mulayam can only get sympathy
 lekin chunaav jeetne ke liye aapako voton kii jarurat hoti he
 At the age of 78, it seems unlikely that Mulayam could pull votes like a magnet
 2
 Whatever claims Mulayam may make in meetings held in unorganized rooms on bicycles, but it will not be possible for the Election Commission to ignore the affidavits of 206 mlas and 15 mps
 in sabhi vidhayakon-saansadon ne likhit main akhilesh ko samarthan diya he
 The entire gamble of the Mulayam Singh camp in the Election Commission rests on the same point that the party session convened by Akhilesh on January 1 was illegal and against the constitution of the party
 haalanki mulaayam ko ye bhi acchhee tarah maaloom he ki unhone ateet main khud bhi aise kai faisle liye hai jinamein party ke samvidhan kii adhik parvaah nahin kii gai thi
 The Akhilesh camp has already indicated this to the Election Commission
 3
 The pressure of the candidates, even in the cold weather when the socialist mercury is in spate, cannot be ignored that despite the biggest quarrel of the family so far, there are 167 candidates who have equal trust of both Akhilesh and Mulayam
 in sabhi ummidavaaron ke naam donon khemon kii ore se jari kii gai soochiyon main samaan hai
 As time is running out, the candidates want Mulayam to do a reconciliation so that he can travel for the electoral battle by riding on a 'bicycle'
 'cycle' kaa chunaav chihn itane varshon main samaajawaadee party kaa paryaay ban chukaa he
 All these candidates are under pressure on Mulayam to declare reconciliation in a show of greatness
 4
 Mayawati's return? Say political rivalry or personal dislike, nothing can be more painful for Mulayam Singh than seeing Mayawati as the Chief Minister in Uttar Pradesh
 mulaayam acchhee tarah jaanate hai ki unke parivaar ke jhagade kaa sidhaa phayda 'dushman number 1' ko hoga
 If the Samajwadi Party appears to be lagging behind in the electoral race, Muslims will have no other option but to vote for the BSP
 mulaayam bijepi sarkaar ko to ek baar jhel sakate hai lekin mayawati ko mukhyamantri ke taur par dekhnaa unhen hargiz bardaasht nahin hoga
 5
 kya sab drama ?aise logon kii kami nahin jo gambhirtha se maanate hai ki samaajawaadee parivaar kaa ye jhagada gadha gaya he or isaki script khud siyasat ke khantee khilaadi mulaayam singh ne likhi he
 Just because the son's feet are so solidly placed on the political ground that he will no longer need any support
 aisa maanane vaale logon kaa tark he ki mulaayam aakhirkaar ye sunishchit kar denge ki shivpal, amar singh or ramgopal apni saakh khokar haashie par chale jaaen or sirf 'tipu' (akhilesh kaa ghar kaa naam) ke haathon main hi samaajawaadee party kii chamakati talwaar bache or use wo jaise chahen, vaise chalaaen
 To some extent, Amar Singh, Ram Gopal Yadav and Shivpal are also having to bear the brunt of the image, but after the electoral process has started, now the question is whether Akhilesh will be able to overcome Nayya on his own? Is hidden behind philhal aisi baithkon kaa silsilaa jari he jinamein or sab kuch saamne aa rahaa he sivaae nattejey ke
 Political turmoil has clearly come to light between the mother and daughter in Apna Dal
 party adhyaksh krishna ne apni badi beti aurasaansad anupriya patelko anushaasanheenata ke aarope main party mahasachiv ke pad se hataa diya he
 Pallavi, the younger daughter, has been made party general secretary
 yah sab aise samay hua he, jab kuch dinon pehle hi anupriya patel ne parivaar main matbhed kii khabaron ko puri tarah khaarij kiya tha
 Anupriya then said, 'for some time, there has been misleading publicity about my party and family
 party or parivaar alag alag ikaiyaan hai
 If some people are unable to understand it then it is their narrow view, which i condemn
 'gauratlab he ki apana dal kii rashtriya adhyaksh krishna ne choti beti pallavi ko party kaa rashtriya upaadhyaksh manonith kar diya tha, jiske baad hue vivaad par party kii ore se lagaataar spashtikaran aa rahe the
 Regarding this, Anupriya Patel said, 'there is no post of vice in the constitution of the party
 ' The railway bribe scandal started from Vijay Singla, nephew of railway minister Pawan Bansal, is spreading
 sibiai ne is maamle main giraftaar kiye gaye ek shaks manjunath ke ek sahyogi rahul yadav or samir sandhir naam ke shaks ko giraftaar kiya he
 Rahul Yadav is arrested in Delhi, while two middlemen named Ajay Garg and Sushil Daga have also been detained
 philhal in donon se sibiai poochtacha kar rahi he
 The comments isse pehle, railway board ke pad ke liye rishwat dene ke maamle main giraftaar railmantri ke bhaanje vijay singla samet chaar aropiyon ko shanivaar ko sibiai kii vishesh adaalat main pesh kiya gaya, jahaan se in sabhi aropiyon ko chaar din kii police remand par bhej diya gaya
 According to the CBI, the whole deal was fixed at Rs 10 crore, half of which was to be paid before work and half after work
 iske badale main railmantri pawan bansal ke bhaanje vijay singla se mahesh kumaar ko member staff se member electric banane kii baat tay hui thi
 Mahesh Kumar has been suspended in this case

 sibiai ke mutabik yah puri deal 10 karod rupee main tay hui thi, jiskaa aadha paisa kaam ke pehle or aadha kaam hone ke baad dena tha
 In return, it was decided to make Mahesh Kumar from Member Staff to Member Electric from Vijay Singla, the nephew of Railway Minister Pawan Bansal
 is maamle main mahesh kumaar ko suspend kar diya gaya he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has reacted strongly to senior Congress leader p Chidambaram
 bijepi ne kaha ki congress party ke liye yah sharmnaak he ki unka ek varisht netaa bhagaude kii tarah bartaav kar rahaa he
 BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha said that P
 Chidambaram seems to want to include himself in the list of Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi
 khaas baat yah he ki purv kendriya mantripi chidambaram (P Chidambaram)ko supreme court se forirahat nahin mili he
 Chidambaram had filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking interim protection
 court number teen main justise en ve ramana ke samaneyachika daakhil karke jald sunwaayee kii maang kii gai thi
 But Justice Ramna said that he is sending the petition to the CJI, they will decide when the petition will be heard? It is now reported that the case will be heard on Friday
 is bich sibiai sutron kaa kahana he ki chidambaramke jorbagh ke ghar ke alaava dilli ensiaar main kai or jagahon par chhapemari jari he
 It is being told that Chidambaram was called once in the same case last year and he also came
 duusari taraf,chidambaramko sibiai ne 2 ghante kaa hi notice kyon diya, is par sibiai ne koi jabaab nahi diya he
 The CBI only says that it is a process of investigation
 duusari taraf, idi ke baadasibiai ne bhi chidambaram ke khilaaf luk out circular jari kar diya he
 Let us tell you that the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED), former Union Minister P
K
 chidambaramaki giraftaar se raahat maangane vaali yachika ke sandarbh main supreme court main kaiviet daakhil kiye hai
 Now, the court cannot hear a judgment in the case without hearing the parties to the filing of the caveat
 iske alawapravartan nideshaalay ne chidambaram ke khilaaf lukout notice jari kiya he
 The ED team reached Chidambaram's house on Tuesday evening
 lekin chidambaram apane ghar par nahin mili
 Apart from this, the CBI team also went to his house on Tuesday evening, after not meeting him, the CBI had given a notice to appear outside his house in two hours
 vahiin buudhvaar subah sibiai kii team unke ghar phir pahunchi
 But even on Wednesday morning, the CBI team returned unscathed

 desh main nakad narayan par karfu kii ghoshnaa pradhanmantri ne 8 november kii raat kii thi
 Since then all the issues in the country are over and at least 80 crores of the country's population is distressed to get a single note of two thousand rupees from about two lakh branches of banks and post offices
 desh ke zyaadaatar kaarobaar ek aghoshit band kii jad main he
 In such a situation, it was continuously awaited that an industrial organization would immediately present an estimate of how much of the gross domestic product (GDP) would be lost due to the loss of most of the work in the country
 yah bhi ki yah nuksaan vasuul kiye jane vaale kaale dhan kii tulana main kam hoga yaa zyada
 But this time, industrial organizations that released such figures in the strike of Bharat Bandh or trade unions have been kept silent this time
 ho saktaa he ki unhen dar ho ki kahin unhen kaale dhan kaa himachati ghoshit na kar diya jaae
 These surveys may not have come yet, but such old surveys are available
 jaise farvari 2013 main jab majdoor unionon ne deshvyapee band bulaayaa to audyogic sanghathan asocham ne ek hi din main 26,000 karod rupee ke jidipi kaa nuksaan hone kaa daawa kiya
 On a similar Bharat bandh in September 2016, Assocham estimated a loss of Rs 16,000 to 18,000 crore in a single day
 desh main exise duty ke khilaaf hui sunaaron kii hadtaal main hi 18 din main 60,000 karod rupee ke jidipi ke nuksaan kaa akalan diya gaya
 It is also seen that the actual loss after closure is often much higher than what the institutions estimate
 in aakalnon ko gaur se dekhen to inamen kiya yah jaataa he ki desh ke saal bhar ke jidipi ko 365 din se bhaag dekar prati din kajidipinikaal liya jaataa he
 And the loss is often estimated to be between 70 and 90 percent of GDP
 desh kii maujuuda haalat dekhen to dihadi mazdooron kaa kaam to buree tarah thap he
 The markets have also been illuminating
 bainkon main bhi saamaanya kaamkaaj hone ke bajaay noton kii adla-badali ho rahi he
 In this case, according to the country's annual GDP (at present value) of 125 lakh crores, the GDP of one day is 34,359 crores
 sthir mulya par rojaanaa kaa jidipi 29161 karod ru
 Sits iskaa 80 fisadi hua 23,328 karod ru
 And 70 per cent is Rs 20,412, so if we go on assuming 70 per cent loss, then GDP will cost more than 2 lakh crores in 10 days
 11 november ko press conference main bijepi adhyakshmit shahne bhi banking pranali ke puri tarah patari par aane ke liye kam se kam 10 din lagane kii baat kahi he
 Three days have already passed
 noton kii badali kaa yah puraa khel 50 din chalanaa he
 In such a situation, if the GDP is hit by 3 to 5 lakh crores, then there is no big deal
 ab aate hai is puri muhim se vasuul hone vaale kaale dhan ke sawaal par
 It is being said by the Finance Ministry that the government hopes that the notes number two to three lakh crore rupees will be earned and no one will show courage to deposit them
 aise main sarkaar ke paas itani hi kshamta keatirikt notechhapane kii shakti aa jaaegi
 To put it simply, if everything goes according to the wishes of the government, then two to three lakh crore rupees will die in the economy and the government will print it as many new notes and consider it to be a recovery of black money
 jo kaaphi had tak sahi he
 This amount will sit close to 2 per cent of India's economy with an annual GDP of Rs 125 lakh crore

 westeindies ke is star of spinner kii mushkilen bad gai hai
 In fact, match officials have been complained about Sunil Narine's illegal bowling action in a match of Pakistan Super League
 agar sunil naren is maamle main doshi paae gaye, to vah isisi ke niyam ke tahat PSL toornament ke bache maichon main nilambit ho sakate hai or saath hi aagaamee ipel 11 main bhi unke khilne par sankat ho saktaa he
 It could also be a big setback for Kolkata Knight Riders
 sunil naren pakistan super lig main lahore kalandars kii ore se khelte hai
 In this league being played in the UAE, Naren's action was questioned in the match against Quetta Gladiator
 naren ko ipel main kolkata nite rides kii team ne rittin kiya tha
 Nepal cricket team achieved one day ODI, PCB said that, Naren is seen bowling with illegal action
 aage kii kaarywahi ke liye report ko west indies cricket board ko bheja jayega
 Earlier in IPL 2015 too, Naren's bowling action was reported, the technical committee then barred him from bowling
 november 2015 main isisi ne unhen sandigdh ection ke kaaran nilambit kar diya tha
 His action check found that his elbow twisted more than a 15 degree angle while throwing all the balls, while the ICC only allowed up to 15 degree elbows to bend
 philhal pradesh main bhaajapa kaa nayaa adhyaksh koun hoga yah abhi kahana mushkil he, lekin siyaasi galiyaaron main kai naamon kii lekar charchaaon kaa bazaar garm he
 According to BJP sources, the names of many leaders are going ahead
 inamen se kiski pradesh adhyaksh ke rup main tajposhi kii jaaegi, ye to aane vaala vakt hi batayega
 Mayawati raised questions on PM Modi's foreign policy regarding SAARC countries, said- no one can remain happy by quarreling with a neighbor
 Which is keeping the Dalit vote bank along with the upper castes and backward, but most of the chances are of the upper caste leader
 unhone bataaya ki gautamabuddhanagar ke saansad dow mahesh sharma kaa naam bhi is samay charchaa main he
 He has five years of government experience
 vah sanghathan ke bhi vyakti maane jate hai
 Similarly, an experiment can be conducted by bringing Deputy Chief Minister Dr
 Dinesh Sharma in the organization
 mahaamantri vijay bahadur pathak bhi adhyaksh pad ke liye sanghathan kii drushti se upyukt maane ja rahe hai
 Similarly, if BJP will think of placing bets in backward faces, then the first name is Swatantra Dev Singh
 vah yogi sarkaar main parivahan mantri or madhyapradesh ke prabharee bhi hai
 At the time of elections, the BJP has been taking rallies from them and gathering a mob of organization workers
 iske baad abhi agra se saansad es
 P
 singh baghel, mantri daara singh chouhan kaa naam bhi charchaa main he
 Similarly, if BJP will think of making it from the Dalit community, then names like MLC Laxman Acharya, Prof
 Ramshankar Katheria, Vidyasagar Sonkar of Prime Minister Modi's parliamentary constituency are also in discussion
 is baar adhyaksh varsh 2022 main hone vaale agle vidhansabha chunaav ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi banaaya jayega
 In such a situation, this responsibility can be given to such a person, in whose name there is no dispute and there is no initiation of any sort of factionalism in the party
 siachin main dushman hi nahin thand se bhi ladate hai jawan, -60 degree main anda, aalu or pyaaj ban gaye pathar, dekhen videovahim madhya pradesh main congress dedh dashak baad satta main lauti he, or congress kii is safalataa main adivasee varg kii badi bhoomika rahi he, magar party ke paas ek bhi aisa adivasee cheharaa nahin he, jisaki pahchaan puure pradesh main ho or uske sahare vah apni raajnneetik jameen ko taiyaar kar sake
 So the party has started searching for the tribal leader
 congress sutron ke anusaar, party loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke baad adivasee matadaataaon ko apane saath jode rakhane ke liye kisi sarvamaanya adivasee netaa kii talash kar rahi he
 There has been a demand from within the Congress to give importance to the tribals
 rajya ke mantri sajjan singh verma ne to grahamantri bala bachchan ko pradeshdhyaksh banane kii paroksh rup se maang kar daali he
 He calls Bachchan an experienced leader
 darasal, rajya main adivasee varg kii lagbhag 22 pratishat aabaadi he
 47 constituencies of the assembly are reserved for this class
 varsh 2018 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress ne in 47 main se 30 sthanon par jeet darj kii thi
 The Congress was successful in more than 60 percent of the places reserved for the tribal sections
 isi tarah congress ke 114 vidhayakon main 25 pratishat se zyada is varg ke hai
 Ramdas Athawale, minister in Modi government, took a pinch, said - Uddhav Thackeray goes to Ayodhya 10 times, but nothing is going to happen in the Vidhan Sabha elections, where the Congress got success in the tribal areas, while in the Lok Sabha elections it does not get a single seat of this class Pie
 congress ko 29 siton main se sirf ek seat hi mili he
 She is also from Chhindwara, where Kamal Nath's son Nakulnath won the elections
 is kaaran se congress adivaasiyon ko apane paale main banaae rakhane kii jugat main jute gai he
 The Congress has had tribal leaders like Dalveer Singh, Bhanwar Singh Porte, Jamuna Devi at some point in the state, who were in doubt when they were in power, and kept the ruling party in trouble while in opposition
 magar jamuna devi ke nidhan ke baad congress main is varg kaa ek bhi netaa ubharkar saamne nahin aa paaya he
 Those leaders with big names, their own political ground has weakened
 duusari ore janaadhar waalon ke paas godfadar kaa abhaav he
 If we look at the tribal leaders in the Congress politics of the state, the faces of ministers Umang Singar, Omkar Singh Markam, MLA Fundelal Singh Makre in the government
 ye sabhi nai peedi ke netaa hai
 The party can bet on the face of those who are active among the tribals
 mamata banerjee ko ek or jhatka, BJP ne darjeeling nagar palika main bahumat hasil kiyaraajanneetik vishleshak soji thomas kaa kahana he, "adivaasiyon ke bich kisi daur main congress kii gahari paith rahi he, uskaa vot bank he, usee ke chalate vidhansabha chunaav main safalataa mili, magar vartmaan daur main congress ke bheetar is varg ke netaaon ko mahatv nahin mil paaya he, uske liye is varg ke netaa bhi kam doshi nahin hai, kyonki in netaaon ne adivasee samskruti se kaaphi duuri bana lee he

 The Gujarat assembly election was not announced officially, but political enthusiasts have intensified
 bijepi jahaan apni satta ko barkaraar rakhane main juty he, to congress satta main vaapasi ke liye bekaraar he
 Apart from this, regional parties are also gearing up to contest elections in the state
 haalanki raajnneetik jaankaar maanate hai ki kshetreey partiyaan agar swatantra rup se chunaav ladati hai to bijepi virdohi vot baantkar wo congress kii jeet kii ummiido par pani pher sakati hai
 There are only two months left in the election
 rajya kii satta main bijepi 19 saal se kabiz he
 For the first time in the last two decades, such political conditions have been created in the state, through which the Congress is expecting its return
 gujarat chunaav main ensipi,jediu, gujarat parivartan partyor bahujan samaaj party jaise dal kai siton par haath aajamaate rahe hai
 These parties may not win seats, but their votes affect the election results
 pichley chunaav main gujarat parivartan party ne 3
 63 per cent and Bahujan Samaj Party 1
 25 fisadi vot hasil kiye the
 JDU is just 0
 67 fisadi vot mili the
 Vaghela has also prepared his senior leader Raheshankar Singh Vaghelane, to prepare for the Third Front, to shed water on the aspirations of the Congress
 pichley maheene congress ke khilaaf vidroh karne vaale shankar waghela ke bare main mana ja rahaa tha ki ve bijepi jwine karenge
 But instead of joining BJP, Vaghela has made up his mind to enter the state elections by creating a third front
 waghela ne is tisare morche kaa naam "jan vikalp" diya he
 He said that people are bored with BJP and Congress and are desperate for an alternative
 bijepi netaaon kii maujuudagi main diya tha istifagauratlab he ki shankar singh waghela jab congress se istipha de rahe the, us samay rajya ke mukhyamantri vijay roopaani, up mukhyamantri nitin patel or kai varisht bijepi netaa maujuud the
 The presence of BJP leaders indicated that Vaghela might return to BJP
 congress se zyada bijepi ko phaaydaaisa nahin he ki vaghela bijepi main shaamil nahin ho sakate the
 But his absence in the BJP is also considered part of the strategy
 bijepi ke virdohi voter wo congress ke kheme main jate
 Vaghela will become an option for him
 aise main iskaa phayda sidhe-sidhe bijepi ko milegaa
 aap's knock will hit Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party on Gujarat's land
 kejariwal ne patel andolan or oona cond ke baad rajya kaa daura kiya tha or vishaal reliyaan yojit kii thim
 Kejriwal has given the slogan in the state that 'gujarat's resolution, you are the right choice'
 jaahir taur par kejariwal kii party kii najar bhi unheen voton par he, jo bijepi se philhal naaraaz he
 That means aap's knock is ready to spoil the Congress game
 ensipi, shivasena or bispi bhi utregi maidan menrajya main ensipi ke do or jediu ke ek vidhayak hai
 This time also NCP and JDU will contest the assembly elections
 iske alaava bispi or shivasena bhi chunavi taiyaariyaan karne lagi hai
 In this way, there will be a scattering of angry voters from BJP and BJP will get direct benefit instead of getting it from Congress
 ensipi se alag hona congress ko mahangaa padegaensipi kii sthapana 1999 main hui or party ne gujarat main 2002 main 1
 71 per cent, 1 in 2007
 65 fisadi vot mili or party ke 3 vidhayak jitkar aae
 After this, the performance of NCP declined in 2012 assembly elections but it was just 0
 95 fisadi vot mila
 The NCP won 2 seats in this election
 aankadon se saaf he ki 182 siton vaali gujarat vidhansabha main ensipi khaasi kamjor he
 However, the party tries to contest as many seats as possible
 congress gujarat kii satta se 20 saal se baahar he, aise main agar ensipi ke saath milakar chunaav ladati he to mumkin he party ke vot share or siton main kuch badhotaree ho jaae
 But the path of NCP and Congress is different in the state

 Public sector defense company BEML said it would sue former army chief General VK Singh for defamation in the controversial Tatra deal
 bimail ke adhyaksh viares natarajan ne kaha, "yah durbhagyapurna he ki wike singh ne tatra trek kii keemat or gunvattta par galat or ascharyajanak bayaan diya, jise ham 1990 ke dashak se sena ko aapurti kar rahe hai
 " general singh ne daawa kiya tha ki sena ko beche jane vaale tatra trek na sirf kaaphi adhik mahange hai, balki gunvattta or sanchaalan main bhi behatar nahin hai
 The general also alleged that a former army officer offered him a bribe of Rs 14 crore to approve contracts for the supply of 600 additional Tatra trucks to the army
 singh pad se guuruuvaar ko sevanivrutt hue
 Natarajan dismissed several allegations leveled against the company by VK Singh and said that the company had no role in allegedly offering him a bribe of Rs 14 crore to approve contracts for 600 additional Tatra trucks
 tippaniyan Natarajan said, "the army never complained about the quality or capacity of Tatra trucks
 " unhone kaha ki wike singh ne apni 42 saal kii seva ke aakhir main company par galat or nuksaan karne vaala aarope lagaaya he
 He said that trucks have been supplied as per the procedure decided by the Ministry of Defense
 natarajan ne kaha ki general singh ko kisi tisare paksh se rishwat kii peshkash ke aarope se hamaara koi sarokaar nahin he
 BEML President VRS Natarajan said, "it is unfortunate that VK Singh gave an inaccurate and surprising statement on the price and quality of the Tatra truck, which we have been supplying to the Army since the 1990s
" " General Singh had claimed that Tatra trucks sold to the army are not only significantly more expensive, but also not superior in quality and operation
 general ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki ek purv sena adhikari ne unhen sena ko 600 atirikt tatra trakon kii aapurti ke theke ko manjuuri dene ke liye 14 karod rupee rishwat kii peshkash kii thi
 Singh retired on Thursday
 natarajan ne wike singh dwaara company par lagaae gaye kai aaropon ko khaarij kiya or kaha ki 600 atirikt tatra trakon ke theke ko manjuuri dene ke liye unhen kathith taur par 14 karod rupee rishwat kii peshkash main company kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 The comments natarajan ne kaha, "sena ne tatra trakon kii gunvattta yaa kshamta ko lekar kabhi shikaayat nahin kii
 "he said that VK Singh, at the end of his 42 years of service, accused the company of being wrong and doing harm
 unhone kaha ki raksha mantralay dwaara tay kii gai prakriya ke tahat hi trakon kii aapurti kii gai he
 Natarajan said that we have nothing to do with the charge of offering bribe to General Singh from any third party
 general singh ne daawa kiya tha ki sena ko beche jane vaale tatra trek na sirf kaaphi adhik mahange hai, balki gunvattta or sanchaalan main bhi behatar nahin hai

 bhagwaan hanuman kii jati ko lekar chal rahi bahes par chutki lete hue bhaajapa ke sahyogi dal shivasena ne shanivaar ko kaha ki behatar he ki ramayana ke anya paatr bhi apana jati pramaan patr taiyaar rakhen
 According to the news agency language, the party termed the debate as baseless and baseless and said that efforts are being made to write a new Ramayana by imposing caste on Lord Hanuman in Uttar Pradesh Assembly and such efforts should be stopped
 shivasena ne apane mukhpatr saamana main ek sampadakeey main kaha, ayodhya main ram mandir kaa abhi nirmaan kiya janaa he lekin bhakthi or vafadari ke avatar hanuman kii jati ko lekar bhaajapa main bahes shuru ho gai he
 What is the point of debating the religion and caste of Lord Hanuman
 sampadakeey main kaha gaya he haal main sampann vidhansabha chunaavon main prachaar karte hue uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne kaha tha ki hanuman dalit the
 After this, many others claimed that Hanuman belonged to their caste
 isamen kaha gaya he iske baad unke party ke netaa evam parshad bukkal nawab ne kaha ki vah musalmaan the
 Actually it is foolish to find out the caste of Lord Hanuman
 uddhav thakare ke netritv vaali party ne kaha ki adityanath ke mantrimandal ke sahakarmi lakshmi narayan choudhary ne vidhansabha main on record kaha tha ki bhagwaan jat the
 Shiv Sena said that Acharya Nirbhay Sagar Maharaj claimed that according to Jain texts, Lord Hanuman was a Jain
 saamana main kaha gaya he, is tareeke se uttar pradesh vidhansabha main nai ramayana likhi ja rahi he or uske mukhya paatro ke saath jati kaa thappa lagaaya ja rahaa he
 a temple of Lord Rama was to be built in Ayodhya, but these people are trying to find out the caste of Ram's devotee
 isamen kaha gaya he, is tareeke se ve hanuman kaa majaak bana rahe hai
 But those who call themselves the guardians of Hindutva are silent on this
 agar yah muslimon yaa pragatisheel logon ne kiya hota to yah hindutv sena hangaamaa kar detii
 Shiv Sena said, despite the bjp's defeat in the recent elections, the debate on Hanuman's caste is likely to continue
 at: ramayana ke anya paatro ko ab apana jati praaanpatr taiyaar rakhana chahie

 a Taliban commander has written a letter to Malala Yousafzai, explaining why he attacked her
 iske saath hi commander ne hamale par afsos bhi jataayaa he
 This letter of about 2,000 words has been written on July 15, but it is not clear from where it has been sent
 daily mail ke mutabik purv raashtrapati general parvej musharraf kii hatya kii koshish main wonted talbini commander adnan raashid ne malala ko chitthee likhakar kaha he ki pichley saal oktober main jab us par hamalaa hua to use bahut bada jhatka laga tha
 It was the Taliban who attacked Malala in Pakistan's northwest Swat Valley in October last year, in which he was shot in the head
 vah us vakt apni skool bas se ghar laut rahi thim
 The attack was condemned worldwide and Malala was put on a UK airlift for treatment
 philhal unki tabiyat main kaaphi sudhaar hua he or wo britain main hi rahakar padhai kar rahi hai
 Just a few days ago he gave a speech at a United Nations conference on the occasion of his 16th birthday in New York, in which he emphasized the right to free education for all children
 darasal, jis vakt malala par hamalaa hua tha us vakt raashid purv raashtrapati musharraf kii hatya kii koshish ke aarope main jail main band tha
 a few days later he managed to escape by breaking prison
 baahar aane ke baad use pataa chalaa ki malala par taliban ne hamalaa kiya he
 Now he has written a letter and apologized for the attack
 raashid ne likhaa he, 'aapke upar hue hamale kii khabar sunakar mujhe jhatka laga tha
 i wish it did not happen to you, but i had also advised you earlier
 'chitthee main usne yah bhi kaha he ki us par isliye hamalaa nahin kiya gaya kyonki vah skool janaa chaahati thi, balki vah pakistan main taliban ke khilaaf bol rahi thi
 According to him, 'I wanted to meet you at that time and tell you to stay away from anti-taliban activities, but i did not have your address
 aap par hue hamale se main kaaphi dukhi tha kyonki ham donon ek hi yusufajai adivasee community se aate hai
 'he wrote,' You said in your speech at the United Nations that a sword is a big pen, so they attacked you for your sword, not your books or school
 'raashid ke mutabik vah ladakiyon kii shiksha ke nahin, balki pashchimi shiksha ke khilaaf he
 But immediately after this, Rashid wrote, while writing the talc mood, 'the Taliban believe that you were deliberately writing against them and were running a campaign to divert their efforts to establish Islamic rule in Swat and your The writing was provocative
 'raashid ne malala se poocha he, 'swat main taliban ke vidrah se pehle or baad main bhi vahaan hajaaron ladkiyaan skool ja rahi hai
 Can you tell why you (the Taliban) were on their hit list
 'usne aage likhaa he ki skulon ke barbaad hone ke peeche sirf taharik-e-taliban iklauta kaaran nahin hai
 He has claimed that the Pakistani army uses schools as barracks
 isi ke saath usne yah bhi kaha he ki malala pakistan laut aaen or kisi bhi madrase main talim hasil karen
 He wrote, 'I want you to come back home, adopt Islamic and Pashtun culture, read women in any Islamic seminary near your hometown, gain knowledge of the Book of Allah, use your pen to work for the good of the Muslim community and In the name of the new world, i suggest exposing the small elite in the conspiracy to enslave the whole of humanity
 'gauratlab he ki malala ne sanyukt raashtra main apane bhaashan main ladakiyon kii shiksha ke liye kaam karte rahane kii apil kii thi
 She said that she is not against anyone and wants education for the sons and daughters of all the Taliban, all terrorists and all extremists
 malala ne kaha, 'main mujhe goli maarane vaale talib se bhi nafrat nahin karti hum
 Even if i have a gun in my hand and she is standing in front of me, i will not kill her
 ' pichley saal sir main goli lagane ke baad ilaaj karaane britain gayi malala apane parivaar ke saath philhal britain main hi hai
 This is a copy of the original letter of tehreek-e-taliban commander Adnan Rashid to Malala: Miss Malala yousafzaii am writing to you in my personal capacity this may not be the opinion or policy of tehreek-e-taliban Pakistan or other jihadi faction or group
 i heard about you through BBC Urdu service for the first time, when i was in bannu prison, at that time i wanted to write to you, to advise you to refrain from anti-taliban activities you were involved in
 but i could not find your address and i was thinking how to approach you with real or pseudo name, my all emotions were brotherly for you because we belong to the same Yousafzai tribe
 Meanwhile the prison brake happened and i was supposed to be in hiding
 when you were attacked it was shocking for me i wished it would never happen and i had advised you before
 Taliban attacked you, was it islamically correct or wrong, or you were deserved to be killed or not, i will not go in this argument now, let’s we leave it to Allah All mighty, He is the best judge
 Here i want to advise you as i am already late, i wish i would have advised u in my prison time and this accident would never happen
 First of all please mind that Taliban never attacked you because of going to school or you were education lover, also please mind that Taliban or Mujahideen are not against the education of any men or women or girl
 Taliban believe that you were intentionally writing against them and running a smearing campaign to malign their efforts to establish Islamic system in swat and your writings were provocative
 You have said in your speech yesterday that pen is mightier than sword, so they attacked you for your sword not for your books or school
 There were thousands of girls who were going to school and college before and after the Taliban insurgency in swat, would you explain why were only you on their hit list ??? Now to explain you the second point, why Taliban are blowing up schools? The answer to this questions in that not only Taliban in KPK or FATA are blowing up the schools but pakistanarmy and Frontier Constabulary is equally involved in this issue
 The reason for this action is common between them that is turning of schools into hide outs and transit camps once it comes under control of either party Pakistan Army or Taliban
 In 2004 i was in Swat, i was researching on the causes of failure of the first revolution attempt by Sufi Muhammad
 i came to know that FC was stationed in the schools of swat in tehsil Matta and FC was using schools as their transit camps and hid outs
 Now tell me who to blame ??? Dozens of schools and colleges are being used by Pakistan Army and FC as their barracks in FATA, you can find out easily if you like
 So when something sacred is turned lethal it needs to be eliminated this is the policy of Taliban
 Blowing up schools when they are not using strategically is not the Taliban job, some black sheep of local administration may be involved to extract more and more funds in the name of schools to fill their bank accounts
 Now i come to the main point that is EDUCATION, it is amazing that you are Shouting for education, you and the UNO is pretending that as you were shot due to education, although this is not the reason, be honest, not the education but your propaganda was the issue and what you are doing now, you are using your tongue on the behest of the others and you must know that if the pen is mightier than the sword then tongue is sharper and the injury of sword can be hailed but the injury of the tongue never hails and in the wars tongue is more destructive than any weapon
 i would like to share with you that the Indian sub-continent was highly educated and almost every citizen was able to read or write before the British invasion
 Locals used to teach British officers Arabic, Hindi, Urdu and Persian
 Almost every mosque was acting as school too and Muslim emperors used to spend a huge sum of money on education
 Muslim India was rich in farming, silk, and jute and from textile industry to ship building
 No poverty, no crises and no clashes of civilization or religion
 Because the education system was based on noble thoughts and noble curriculum
 i want to draw your attention to an extract from the minute written by Sir T
 b Macaulay tobritish parliament dated 2nd February 1835 about what type of education system is required in Indian sub-continent to replace the Muslim education system
 He stated “we must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern, - a class of persons Indian in blood and color, but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect ”this was and this is the plan and mission of this so called education system for which you are ready to die, for which UNO takes you to their office to produce more and more Asians in blood but English in taste, to produce more and more Africans in color but English in opinion, to produce more and more non English people but English in morale
 This so called education made Obama, the mass murder, your ideal
 isn't it? why they want to make all human beings English? Because Englishmen are the staunch supporters and slaves of farmers
 Do you know Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, the founder and symbol ofenglish education in India was a freemasons
 You say a teacher, a pen and a book can change the world, yes i agree with, but which teacher which pen and which book? It is to be specified, Prophet Muhammad Peace be upon him said i am sent as a teacher, and the book He sent to teach is Quran
 So a noble and pious teacher with prophetic curriculum can change the world not with satanic or secular curriculum
 You have given the example that once a journalist asked a student that why a talib was afraid of this education he replied a talib did not know what was in this book
 The same i say to you and through you to whole world that why they afraid from the book of Allah because they don’t know what is in it
 Taliban want to implement what is in the book of ALLAH and UNO want to implement what they have in man-made books
 We want to connect the world to their creator through the book of Allah and UNO want to enslave the world to few evil creatures
 You have talk about justice and equality from the stage of and unjust institution, the place where you were standing uttering for justice and equality, all the nations are not equal there, only five wicked states have the veto power and rest of them are powerless, dozens of time when all the world untied against the Israel only one veto was enough to press the throat of justice
 The place you were speaking to the world is heading towards new world order, i want to know what is wrong the old world order? They want to establish global education, global economy, global army, global trade, global government and finally global religion
 i want to know is there any space for the prophetic guidance in all above global plans? Is there any space for Islamic sharia or Islamic law to which UN call inhumane and barbaric? You have talk about attack on polio team, would you explain why the then American foreign secretary of state Henry Kissinger, a Jew, said in 1973 to reduce the third world population by 80%
 Why the sterilization and eugenics programs are running in different countries in one way or another under the umbrella of UNO
 More than 1 million Muslim women have been sterilized in Uzbekistan forcibly without their consent
 Bertrand Russell writes in his book the impact of science on society, “diet, injections and injunctions will combine, from a very early age, to produce the sort of character and sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable and any serious criticism of power that be will become psychologically impossible”
 This is why we have the reservation on so called polio vaccination program
 You say Malala day is not your day it is the day of every person who has raised voice for their rights, i ask you why such a day in not assigned to Rachel Corrie, only because the bulldozer was Israeli? Why such a day in not assigned to Affia Siddique because the buyers are americans?why such day is not assigned to Faizan and Faheem because the killer was Raymond davis?why such a day in not assigned to those16 innocent afghan women and children who were shot dead by an American Robert Belas because he was not a talib
 i ask you and be honest in reply, if you were shot but Americans in a drone attack, would the world have ever heard updates on your medical status? Would you be called 'daughter of the nation? Would the media make a fuss about you? Would General Kiyani have come to visit you and would the world media be constantly reporting on you? Would you were called to UN? Would a Malala day be announced? More than 300 innocent women and children have been killed in drones attacks but who cares because the attackers are highly educated, non-violent, peaceful Americans
 i wish, the compassion you learnt from Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him should be learnt by Pakistan Army so they could stop shedding of Muslim blood in FATA and Baluchistan
 i wish, the compassion you learnt from Prophet Jesus should be learnt by USA and NATO so they should stop shedding blood of innocent Muslims across the world and i wish the same for followers of Buddha to stop killing of innocent unarmed Muslims in Burma, and Sri Lanka and wish the same for Indian army to follow Gandhi jee and stop genocide in Kashmir, and yes, the followers of bacha khan, the ANP has an example of non-violence in their five years regime inkpk province, for example Swat, where a single shot was not fired and we witnessed the followers of bacha khan implemented the philosophy of nonviolence in its true soul, with support of jets, tanks and gunships
 At the end i advise you to come back home, adopt the Islamic and pushtoon culture, join any female Islamic madrassa near your home town, study and learn the book of Allah, use your pen for Islam and plight of Muslim ummah and reveal the conspiracy of tiny elite who want to enslave the whole humanity for their evil agendas in the name of new world order
 All praises to Allah the creator of the Universe

 pakistan sthit aatanki sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyaba or khalistaan samarthit aatankiyon kii madad hinduvadi sanghathan aresas, viechpi or shiv sena ke netaaon par aatanki hamale kii sajeesh rachi ja rahi he
 Intelligence agencies are believed to be planning a terrorist attack during the assembly elections in Punjab, UP and Uttarakhand

 In the first group, Khalistani terrorists have been given the responsibility of attacking leaders of RSS, VHP and Shiv Sena

 According to the information, the second group includes Lashkar terrorists
 unhen punjab upi or uttrakhand main chunaaon ke dauraan gadabadi failaane ke saath-saathatanki hamaleka nirdesh diya gaya he
 Intelligence agencies suspect that Pakistani intelligence agency ISI is planning for these terror attacks

 This is the second time Sudhir Kumar was questioned by the Special Investigation Team in this case
 isse pehle ayog ke sachiv parameshwar ram se poochtacha ke baad unhen giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 The state government has suspended him
 is bich vipakshi bhartiya janata party ke netaa susheel modi ne maang kii he ki is prashn-patr li maamle kii jaanch sibiai se karai jaani chahie
 Modi has made this demand on the basis that since the names of many people of the ruling party are coming up in this case and the state police has a track record that it has been avoiding investigating the political angle in every case, so when Madhya Pradesh The CBI is investigating the Vyapam scam, so why is Nitish Kumar not investigating the case with the CBI
 haalanki modi kii maang se ek din pehle mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne yah kahkar is maang ko khaarij kar diya tha ki rajya police jaanch kar rahi he or is maamle main na to kisi ko bachaaya jayega na hi fansaaya jayega
 Action is being taken in this matter and strict action is being taken
 nitish ne kaha ki kisi ko kisi bhi str par koi visheshta hasil nahin he
 Let the police do the research and everyone should be trusted
 vipaksh kaa kahana he ki itane bade ghotaale kii jaanch patna ke varisht police adheekshak manu maharaj ke netritv main bani team kar rahi he
 Modi also questioned researcher Rakesh Dubey that for seven and a half years, as long as BJP was in the state government, he was not given any responsibility in view of his previous controversial track record
 ab nitish kumaar ne itani samvedansheel jaanch kaa jimmaa aise logon ko de diya he
 The comments darasal is maamle main philhal jail main band ayog ke sachiv parameshwar ram ne bataaya tha ki un par sattarudh dal ke kai logon kaa unke logon ko pariksha main paas karne kaa dabaav rahata tha
 Apart from this, Ramashish Rai, the owner of the examination center from whom this entire question paper was leaked, has been the borrower of RJD President Lalu Yadav at one time
 unke skool kii manyata nahin hone ke baavjood vahaan pariksha centre banaaya gaya jo nishchit rup se rajnatik dabaav kaa parinaam he
 However, the state police say that the entire investigation is headed by Patna's IG Nayyar Hasnain Khan, so Modi's allegations are beyond the facts
 lekin sawaal he ki nitish kumaar is mudde par har din aane vaale tathyon ke alok main aalochana jhelte rahenge yaa sibiai ko jaanch kaa jimmaa dekar vipaksh kaa munh band karaayenge
 However, a day before Modi's demand, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar rejected the demand, saying that the state police is investigating and that no one will be saved or implicated in the case
 is maamle main karrvaai ho rahi he or sakht karrvaai ho rahi he
 Nitish said that no one has any specialization at any level
 police ko anusandhan karne dijie or sabko bharosa karnaa chahie
 The opposition says that such a big scam is being investigated by a team headed by senior Patna Superintendent of Police Manu Maharaj
 anusandhankarta rakesh dube par bhi modi ne sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki saadhe saat saal, jab tak bijepi rajya sarkaar main shaamil thi tab tak unhen koi jimmedaari kaa pad unke purv ke vivaadaaspad trek record ke maddenjar nahin diya gaya
 Now Nitish Kumar has given the responsibility of such sensitive investigation to such people
 tippaniyan In fact, in this case, the currently jailed Commission Secretary Parmeshwar Ram had said that he was under pressure from many people of the ruling party to clear his people in the examination
 iske alaava jis pariksha centre se yah puraa prashn patr li hua uske maalik ramashish raay ek jamaane main rajd ke adhyaksh lalu yadav ke jamaanatdaar rahe hai
 Despite the lack of recognition of his school, an examination center was built there, which is definitely a result of political pressure
 haalanki rajya police kaa kahana he ki puri jaanch kii kaman patna ke aiji nayyar hasanan khan ke paas he, isliye modi ke aarope tathy se pare hai
 But the question is whether Nitish Kumar will continue to face criticism in the light of the facts that come up every day on this issue or he will keep the opposition silent by giving the CBI the responsibility of investigation
 vipaksh kaa kahana he ki itane bade ghotaale kii jaanch patna ke varisht police adheekshak manu maharaj ke netritv main bani team kar rahi he

 unhone aaysha ke parivaar par dhokhaa dene kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki yah shaadi amaanya he or vah talaak nahin denge
 Shoaib Malik, who arrived in Hyderabad suddenly before his marriage to tennis star Sania Mirza, gave a press statement and also answered questions from some media persons outside Sania's house on Jubilee Hills
 yah 28 varshiya cricketer 15 april ko yahaan 23 varshiya sania se shaadi karegaa or isi din taj krishna hotel main resepshan hoga
 After some hesitation, Shoaib accepted the 'nikahnama', but said it was invalid because Ayesha's family had a desire to cheat
 unhone kaha ki ab tak vah us ladki se nahin mili hai, jisaki tasviir unhen siddiki parivaar ne bheji thi or use aaysha bataaya tha
 Shoaib said, "now they are talking about divorce

 It is written in Islam that if the marriage is valid, then only divorce can be done

 greem smith ke chupe rustam imran taahir kii kalaiyon ke jaadu or abi divilliars ke balle ke dhamal se dakshin africa ne vishwa cap ke pehle bade mukaable main brihaspativaar ko westeindies ko 43 gend shesh rahete hue saat wicket se haraa diya
 When everyone's eyes were fixed on the pitch of Ferozeshah Kotla, then Pakistan-born Tahir struck the Caribbean team with four wickets for 41 runs in his first international match
 del sten ne 24 ran ke evaj main teen wicket lekar unka puraa saath diya
 For West Indies, Darren Bravo scored 71, his elder brother Dwayne Bravo scored 40 and Devon Smith scored 36 but the final five wickets were 13 for their side to lose within 13 runs
 3 over main 222 ran par simat gai
 South Africa also had two wickets for 20 runs but de Villiers scored an unbeaten 107-run knock off 105 balls and meanwhile captain Smith (45 off 78 balls) with 119 for the third wicket and Jean Pal Duminy: Unbeaten partnership of 84 runs for the fourth wicket with 42 not out
 dakshin africa ne 42
 223 runs for three wickets in 5 overs made a brilliant start to the tenth World Cup
 donon tiimon ke captainon ne spinneron se gendbaaji aagaaj karaayaa
 Smith tried Johan Botha (two wickets for 48 runs) and Darren Sammy gave the same to Sulaiman Benn (one wicket for 51 runs)
 westeindies ne pehle paanch over main behtareen farm main chal rahe hashim amala :14: or anbhavi jaak kallis :04: ko out karke match ko jeevant banaaya, lekin jald hi dakshin africa ne apana dabadabaa bana diya
 If Amla becomes the victim of wicketkeeper Devon Thomas's best catch with one hand, then Ben catches Kallis in the slip by Sammy
 divilliars ne shuru main aakraamak tevar dikhaaye tathaa roach ke over main teen chauke jadkar shuruyaat kii jabaki smith ne unke saath pari sanvaarane kaa acchhee tarah se bidaa uthaaya
 Meanwhile, the West Indies suffered a shock blow from Dwayne Bravo, who slipped during the first ball of his third over and had to leave the field
 westeindies kaa kshetrarakshan bahut kharaab rahaa or usne na sirf kaich tapakaaye balki ran out ke maukey bhi ganvaae
 Smith and de Villiers were able to take advantage of this and remove the pressure on the team
 visheshkar divilliars ne manamafik ran batore or apni pari main aath chauke or do chakke lagaae
 Pollard bowled Smith to take the third wicket to the West Indies but by then South Africa had come out of the crisis
 bich main barish ke halke vyavdhaan ke baad jab khel dobaaraa shuru hua to divilliars 97 gend par vishwa cap kaa apana doosraa or vanade main dasvaan shatak puraa karne main safal rahe
 Earlier, Smith, who had three spinners in the team, proved his decision to start bowling with Botha, who showed the dangerous Chris Gayle (2) pavilion on the third ball
 gail unki aaf brake ko nahin samaj paye jo unke balle ko chuumati hui slip main kallis ke surakshit haathon main chali gayi
 a referral was sought against Darren Bravo on the last ball in which South Africa did not succeed
 iske baad derren ne dakshin africa team ko bryan lara kii yaad dilaane main koi kasar nahin chodi jinhone 1996 or 2003 main shatkeey paariyaan kheli thi
 Darren first targeted Dale Steyn and then recovered from injury to welcome back Kallis with two fours
 unhone or devon smith ne duusare wicket ke liye 111 ran kii saajhedaari karke team ko shuruaati jatke se ubaara
 Darren Bravo scored the first six of the match at long on Tahir
 unki jaandaar pari kaa ant aakhir main botha ne kiya jo doosraa spel old pavilion chor se karne ke liye aaye the
 This time the batsman asked for a referral and the umpire's decision again proved to be correct
 derren ne 82 gend kheli tathaa aath chauke or ek chakka lagaaya
 Tahir took the first international wicket in the next over, caught by Devon Smith with his own ball and then lbw to Ramnaresh Sarwan whose referral appeal proved unsuccessful
 isi over main vah dwen braavo ko bhi out kar dete lekin khud hi phalothru main sidhaa kaich chhod gaye
 Dwayne Bravo took advantage of this by hitting sixes on all three spinners Tahir, Botha and Pietersen but he was run out unfortunate as Shivnarine Chanderpaul was late in action
 chandrapal :31: bhi adhik der tak nahin tik paae or taahir ke tisare shikaar bane
 As soon as Kieran Pollard landed to take his place, the spectators got excited as he stepped on the field, but he returned to the pavilion without opening the account
 sten kii pagabaadha kii joardaar apil amish saheba ne thukraa di lekin refral par tisare ampire ashoka disilva ne dakshin africa ke paksh main faisla sunaaya
 Tahir completed a four-wicket haul by dismissing Devon Thomas (15) while Steyn claimed the Caribbean in the next over, dismissing captain Darren Sammy and then Suleman Benn

 The three boys were accused of molestation and as the video went viral, the bravery of the girls began to be discussed across the country
 kareeb 27 maheene baad rohtak kii court ne shuukravaar ko in teenon ladakon ko maamle main chhod diya kyonki police kii jaanch report main aise koi saboot saamne nahin aa sake jisase in teenon ke khilaaf maamle kii sunwaayee kii ja sake
 The Haryana Police made its report in six months and presented it in the court
 police ko aisa koi gavaah nahin mila jo aarti or puja kumaar dwaara lagaae gaye chhedhkhani ke aarope ko sahi sabit kar sake
 The passengers of the bus also came forward in support of the three boys
 police ke mutabik poligraphy test main bhi aropiyon ke jhooth bolne kii baat saamne nahin ai
 Kuldeep, Deepak and Mohit, seated on a graze in Asan village, 15 km from Rohtak Court, are seen breathing a sigh of relief
 vaise to unhone ek hi raat jail main bitaai he lekin vah bataate hai ki kis tarah yah cese inke liye manhagaa sabit hua
 Deepak says' Both me and Kuldeep wanted to join the army
 hamane medical or physical test paas kar liya tha
