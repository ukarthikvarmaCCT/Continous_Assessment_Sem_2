 Patna's famous DAV school is facing the biggest problem because it has been accused of raising lakhs of money in the name of failing and passing children

 priya skool kii 1 saal kii fees 63 hajaar rupee lekar gai to use skool prabandhan ne pariksha kaa admit card dene se manaa kar diya or priya skool se hi gaayab ho gai
 After about 20 days, when Priya was found wandering at the station, this secret came out darasal priya ko 11veen main fail kar diya gaya or skool se nikaal bhi diya gaya
 But throughout the year, she kept doing classes with school knot
 skool ne gupachup taur par ye bharosa dilaayaa tha ki use 12veen kii pariksha dilaa di jaaegi lekin jab 12veen kii pariksha kaa vakt aayaa to usase 1 lakh rupee se zyada rakam maangi gai
 When the matter was revealed, it was found out that the three teachers and the principal of the school fail the children first and then after giving the amount of lakhs, they get them to the 12th examination

 Thousands of his supporters gathered outside the prison to receive the former MP
 - jail se baahar aate hi shahabuddin jab aaj tak se mukhaatib hue to unhone sidhe bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par hamalaa bol diya
 He said that he never considered Nitish as his leader

 Even after 11 years in jail, there is a lot of crime stains on the breath of open air breathing Bahubali Shahabuddin
 lekin jail se baahar nikalate vakt unhone safed rang kaa kurta pyjama pahan rakhaa tha
 As soon as he came out of jail, Bahubali was surrounded by supporters

 Wherever his convoy stopped on the way, the roads were blocked everywhere
 unke samarthakon ne kai jagah aatishbaajee bhi kii
 - Weeds in the houses of the persecuted people of Shahabuddin
 kai logon ko dar sata rahaa he ki ek ghar ke teen beton kaa katl karne vaala kahin unhen bhi apana shikaar na bana le
 - Let us tell that as soon as coming to power in 2005, Nitish nailed Shahabuddin

 However, after the settlement of the case, many people greeted each other on Independence Day
 pehle mahatma gandhi kii pratimaa kaale pattharon se taraashi hui thi, phir bhagava hui or uske baad baapu golden brown color ke dikhaai dene lage
 This case is of Gandhi Chowk in Bilaspur city

 Until the color of Bapu became golden brown, the Congressmen stayed here
 ye diya bijepi ne tarkbijeypi pravaktaa shrichand sundarani ise congressiyon kii hataasha qaraar de rahe hai
 According to him, the Congress has no issue left, so it blames the BJP by giving meaningless talk

 His party takes pride in wearing it
 sundarani kehete he ki bhul vash kisi karmi ne color kar diya to use badla bhi ja saktaa he
 But the Congress also wants to take it to the people on a day like Independence Day by making it a political issue

 He said, 'I am very happy
 yah bal adhikaron ke liye hamaari ladaai ko manyata he
 i am thankful to the Nobel Committee for recognizing the work done on the plight of millions of children suffering in this modern age
 ’aao sunaaen tumhen malala kii kahani
 
 
 After the announcement of the Nobel Peace Prize, while many people knew about Malala Yousafzai, Kailash Satyarthi's name was new to him
 lekin satyaarthee kii sanstha ‘bachapan bachaao andolan’ se bharat kaa lagbhag har vyakti parichit he
 Who is Kailash Satyarthi? Kailash Satyarthi is a social activist who has been struggling for child rights for years
 satyaarthee bharat main ek gaiyr sarkari sanghathan (enjio) ‘bachapan bachaao andolan’ chalaate hai jo bacchon ko bandhua mazdooree or taskari se bachaane ke kaam main lagi he
 Kailash Satyarthi quit his electrical engineering job and dedicated himself to protecting and enforcing child rights for more than three decades, freed 80,000 child laborers and gave them new hope in life
 ‘bachapan bachaao andolan’ ke rup main unki sanstha logon ke bich main kaaphi lokapriy he
 Satyarthi helps children who are sold to pay off their family debt through this institution
 phir unhen training di jaati he jisase wo apane samudaay main jaakar aisi ghatnaon kii rokthaam ke liye kaam karen
 His organization rescued children employed as bonded laborers in almost every corner of the country, from the persecution of children in factories in major cities of the country like Delhi and Mumbai to the remote areas of Odisha and Jharkhand
 unhone bal taskari evam mazdooree ke khilaaf kade kanoon banane kii vakaalat kii or abhi tak unhen mishrit safalataa mili he
 Satyarthi kept saying that he was concerned about child labor and this helped him to create an organized movement
 bal mazdooree karaane vaale factoriyon main chhapemari ke unke praarambhik prayaas kaa factory maalikon ne kadaa virodh kiya or kai baar police ne bhi unka saath nahin diya lekin dhire-dhire unke kaam kii mahatta ko pahchaan mili
 He also played an important role in the movement for the right to education regarding essential education for children

 It was established in 1980
 apni sanstha ke madhyam se kailash satyaarthee ne ab tak kareeb 80 hajaar bacchon kii jindagi bachaai he
 The most important initiative of this institution is the Bal Mitra Gram Program, which became a new paradigm in the campaign of child bonded labor, child rights and education
 kailash satyaarthee ko is abhiyaan ke shuru karne ke kuch saalon ke baad yah abhas hua ki bal mazdooree or shoshan ke lagbhag 70 fisadi maamle gaanvon main hote hai tab unhone bacchon ko bachaae jane ke baad prashasan dwaara unhen uchit shiksha muhaiyaa ho sake isaki vyavastha par jor dena shuru kiya

 2001 main is model ko apnaane ke baad se desh ke 11 rajyon ke 356 gaanvon ko ab tak child friendli village ghoshit kiya ja chukaa he
 However, most of the work of Kailash Satyarthi is done in the villages of Rajasthan and Jharkhand
 in gaanvon ke bachche skool jate hai, bal panchayat, yuva mandal or mahila mandal main shaamil hote hai or samay samay par gram panchayat se bal samasyaon ke sambandh main baaten karte hai
 'bachpan Bachao Andolan' ensures that all the children of 14 years of age do not leave school with free, comprehensive and level education in Bal Mitra Village, so the basic facilities are available in the schools

 He is also credited with the formation of Rugmark, also known as the Good Web
 yah ek tarah kaa saamaajik pramaan patr he jise dakshin asia main bal majdoor mukt kalinon ke nirmaan ke liye diya jaataa he
 Satyarthi has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize several times earlier for playing an important role in protecting child rights

 com / xqfn60928r uri army base par aatanki hamale ke baad deshbhakti kaa har taraf josh he
 Everyone is bowing down before the sacrifices of the sons of the country
 lekin aisa kyon hota he ki shaheedon ke balidaan ke baad kuch samay tak to unhen bahut jor-shor se yaad kiya jaataa he
 Then gradually everything is forgotten
 ye sawaal ek shahid ke buudhe mata-pita kaa he
 It has been over four years since, both of them are waiting that a leader will come and remove the veil from their Lal statue
 unki budhi ankhen pathara gayi, lekin kisi ko unki bhaawanaaon kaa ehsaas nahin ho rahaa
 Leaders have no time for martyrdom The name of the village located just 50 km from Jaipur is Shekhawati's Dhani
 yahaan shahid prakaash kii kapade se dhaki pratimaa intjaar kar rahi he ki kab sarkaar kii ore se kisi netaa ko vakt mili or wo gaanv aakar pratimaa kaa anaavaran kare
 The condition is that the cloth tied around the statue has also come to be wired
 lekin deshbhakti kii badi-badi baaten karne vaale hamaare netaaon ko iske liye vakt nahin mil paa rahaa
 The father built the memorial of the martyred son, the tears of Prakash's father Krishna Meena, remember the date of May 13, 2012, and still tears up
 isi din unka laadla prakaash dantewada main naksaliyon se loha lete hueshahidahua tha
 At that time, Prakash was only 23 years old
 pita krishna ne prakaash kii shaadi ke liye dil main bade armaan sajaa rakhe the
 But then he decided to build a son's memorial for his lifetime with 11 lakh rupees
 smarak ban kar taiyaar ho gaya
 After this, Krishna has pleaded for the unveiling of the statue from every officer of the administration to the office of the Chief Minister, but everywhere got just the assurance of giving quick time
 aashwaasan mila, par vakt nahinkrishna tatkaaleen mukhyamantri ashok gahalot se mili the, to unhone pratimaa ke anaavaran ke liye vakt bhi de diya tha
 But after the election was announced, the program was deferred citing the code of conduct
 chunaav ke baad vasundhara raaje rajasthan kii mukhyamantri baniin
 Krishna arrived with wife Bhagwati to meet Vasundhara
 vasundhara se bhi unhen aashwaasan hi mila, lekin vakt nahin mila
 Krishna says that he has also met the MP of the area and Union Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore four times, but he too did not get time to unveil the statue
 krishna ke mutabik unhonapradhanmantridaphtar ko bhi chitthee likhi he
 Right now there is a reply from there too
 intjaar karte-karte thak gaye hai maa-bapkrishna or bhagwati intjaar karte-karte itnaa thak gaye hai ki ab unka sabar bhi jawaab dene laga he
 Shaheed Prakash's mother Bhagwati says that if no leader comes till Diwali, she will unveil her red statue herself
 bhagwati kaa kahana he ki is pratimaa main unke bete kii aatma basati he
 Bhagwati's body is old, but every day she cleans the memorial with her own hands
 siem ko haathon se chaahate hai anavaranprakash ke saath hi dantewada main hi dausa ke do or jawan bhi shahid hue the
 The statues of both those soldiers have been unveiled by the Chief Minister
 yahi vajah thi ki krishna or bhagwati bhi chaahate the ki unke bete kii pratimaa kaa pardaa bhi mukhyamantri ke haathon hi hate
 But two more soldiers who were martyred with Prakash, their villages were adjacent to the highway
 vahiin prakaash ke gaanv main jane kaa rasta behad kharaab he
 One has to reach this village by walking several kilometers on a broken road
 kya yahi vajah he ki netaa vahaan tak pahunchane se kataraate hai
 If this is so, then with which mouth is it said: Every year a fair will be put on the pyre of martyrs, this will be the remaining mark of those who die on the countryside
 
 
 pranab mukherjee loksabhaa main upie sarkaar ke 5 saal ke kaarykaal kaa aakhri bajet pesh kar rahe hai
 What is the strategy of the government in relation to the common man and corporate India will be revealed today
 vittamantri pranab mukherjee ne saal 2009-10 kaa antarim bajet pesh karne ke liye taiyaariyaan puri kar lee he
 This interim budget for 2009-10 can only be guessed
 chuki ye bajet upie sarkaar kaa aakhri bajet he, isliye puri gunjaaish he ki ye bajet khaalish chunavi bajet ho
 There may be some tax relief announced, or else the existing tax structure can be maintained, there will be measures to deal with the slowdown in the interim budget, and hence people in housing, construction and export sector can expect relief , Election is just a few steps away, so there will be a shower of relief for the common man, hence farmers, small and medium level entrepreneurs, job professionals, women, youth, high hopes can do
 haalanki antarim bajet se aam bajet kii tarah ummid karnaa bemaani he lekin ye bhi tay he ki upie sarkaar maujuuda kaarykaal ke apane aakhri bajet ko aam bajet jitna lok lubhaavan banane main koi kasar nahin chhodeygi

 isaki maar gharon ke bajet par padi
 The government responded by releasing its buffer stock onion in the market, so that it could be found easily
 usne niryaat rokane ke liye nunatam niryaat mulya (emeepi) badhaakar 850 america dollar prati ton effobi (free on board) keemat kar diya

 After the intervention of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting for the World Cup cricket final between India and Sri Lanka on Saturday, the ICC has lifted the ban on electronic media coverage but called for legal action against those who violate media guidelines
 is

 It has decided to take legal action against the companies involved and will be seeking compensation through the courts in India
 isse pehle subah mumbai main match se pehle donon deshon ke captainon tathaa isisi adhyaksh sharad pavaar ke samvaadadaata sammelnon ko cover karne gaye channelon ke pratinidhiyon ko kawarej se roka gaya
 a similar ban was imposed on the electronic media ahead of the semi-final between India and Pakistan on Wednesday
 lekin soochna or prasaaran mantri ambika soni kii pahal par yah pabandi hataa di gai thi
 The National Broadcasters Association (NBA) and the Broadcast Editors Association (BEA) refused to give assurances that they would follow broadcasting guidelines in their programs, according to an ICC statement
 Will avoid violation
 isisi ke pramukh kaaryakari harun lorgat ne kaha, main is baat se bahut niraash hum ki aisa hua he
 However, we need to protect our and partners' exclusive business rights
 yadi hamen kanoonee karrwai kerani hui to yah khedjanak hogi lekin jaruri bhi
 The ICC said that admit cards were issued to reporters and cameraman on the condition that they would follow the guidelines
 soochna or prasaaran mantralay ke sutron ne kaha ki mantri ambika soni ne is mudde par isisi adhyaksh or kendriya krishi mantri sharad pavaar se baatcheet kii or unase kaha ki yah mudda itnaa bada nahin he ki ise suljhaayaa nahin ja saktaa
 The ICC is said to have told Ambika Soni that Doordarshan has the right to receive the footage, so there will be no problem in broadcasting the match to the Indian public
 news brodcasters association kii mahasachiv ani joseph ne kaha, unhone :isisi ne: hamase ek sahmati karne ke liye kaha tha ki footage kaa vyavsaayik upyog nahin hoga, jo ki galat he
 He said that the channels were following the guidelines framed for T20 and ODI matches
 ani ne kaha, yadi isisi ko koi samasya thi to unhen pehle hi bataanaa chahie tha or semifinal se pehle aisa nahin karnaa chahie tha

 bharat or dakshin africa ke bich test maichon kii siries kaa parinaam kuch bhi rahe, tab bhi bhartiya team ke isisi ranking main number ek sthaan par koi asar nahin padegaa
 But if the South African team wins all three matches, it will make it to the top two
 antarrashtriya cricket parishad (isisi) ne bayaan main kaha ki bhartiya team ke abhi 124 ank hai, jabaki dakshin africa usase 13 ank peeche he
 If the Faf Duplessis-led team makes a clean sweep in the 3-test series that begins in Cape Town from January 5, then both teams will have the same 118 points
 pehle test se pehle feet hai team india ke 'gabbar', par jadeja bimaaraisi sthiti main bhi bharat number ek par bana rahegaa, kyonki dashamalav main gananaa par vah dakshin africa se aage rahegaa
 118 of India on calculation in decimal
 47 ank, jabaki dakshin africa ke 117
 There will be 53 digits
 iske vipareet agar bharat teenon test jeetne main safal rahata he, to viraat kohli kii team ke 128 ank ho jaaenge, jabaki dakshin africa ke 107 ank rah jaaenge
 Meanwhile, Australia have confirmed their third place in the series before a third Test match against England starting in Sydney on Thursday

 to dhoni BCCI ke top grad contract se baahar rakhe jaaenge?agar australia 4-0 se siries jeetta he, to uske 104 ank ho jaaenge or vah tisare sthaan par pahunch jayega
 In such a situation, England will get 99 points and will drop to 5th place
 siries kaa parinaam 3-1 rahane kaa matlab hoga ki australia 102 ank ke saath tisare or england 101 ank lekar chauthe sthaan par rahegaa
 Indian captain Virat Kohli, who is in second place in the rankings of batsmen, can reach 900 rating points for the first time in his career

 manahani ke puraane maamle main kendriya mantri kapil sibbal ke bete kii yachika par supreme court ne kajriwal ke saath-saath prashanth bhushan, shajia ilmi va manish sisodiya ko notice jari kiya
 Also, the Supreme Court has stayed the order of the Delhi High Court in this case
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki trial kii agali tithi 5 march ko in chaaron aropiyon ko court main pesh hona pad saktaa he
 Kapil Sibal's son Amit Sibal had filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Delhi High Court's order in which he had asked the trial court to accept Kejriwal's petition
 kejariwal samet sabhi aropiyon ne hoicourt se apane khilaaf daayar manahani maamla khaarij karne kii maang kii thi
 On 16 January, the High Court refused to hear the petition, asking the petitioners to present it in the trial court
 hoicourt ne yah bhi kaha ki agar is cese main koi vyaktigat peshi se chhot ke liye aavedan karata he, to adaalat isaki ijaajat de sakati he
 Amit Sibal has challenged this order of the High Court in the Supreme Court
 amit sibbal bhi vakil hai
 He filed the case only in July last year, on which the hearing is going on
 aakhir kya he puraa maamla
 
 
 Amit Sibal alleges that these leaders tried to discredit him and his father in the Vodafone tax waiver case
 AAP ke in netaaon ne kapil sibbal par aarope lagaaya tha ki telecom kii badi company vodaphone ke maamle main tex demand riviz karke unhone apane pad kaa durupyog kiya

 According to AAP leaders, Kapil Sibal did this while his son Amit was working at Hutchison
 kejariwal ne sawaal khadaa kiya tha ki kahin is kaam ke liye sibbal ko 2000 karod rupee to nahin die gaye the?gauratlab he ki saal 2007 main vodaphone ne hachisan essar ko kharida tha, jiske liye use 11,217 karod rupee hachisan ko dene the
 Amit Sibal was Hutchison's lawyer at the time
 supreme court ne arun jetali manahani maamle main mangalvaar ko dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kii yachika khaarij kar di
 Kejriwal, in this petition, had demanded the Supreme Court to stop the trial of the lower court in the criminal defamation case filed by Arun Jaitley
 isse pehle dilli hai court siem kejariwal kii is maang ko thukraa chukaa he
 Kejriwal had said in his petition that Jaitley has filed criminal defamation cases against him in Patiala House Court and civil defamation in the High Court together
 donon mukademe kii sunwaayee ek saath nahin ho sakati
 On which the Supreme Court said that there is no such rule that due to a civil case, a criminal trial cannot be heard
 jirah ke dauraan kejariwal kii ore se pesh jethmalani ne kaha kisupreme courtko ek rajya ke siem ke adhikaron kii raksha kerani chahie
 This is a matter between a powerful Finance Minister and a poor Chief Minister of a small state
 supreme court ne kaha ki ham yahaan sirf tathyon or sabooton par vichaar kar rahe hai
 The debate should be in the same scope
 kejariwal kii ore se pesh jethmalani ne kaha ki jajon kii niyukti ko lekar collegium or sarkaar ke bich ladaai he
 On this, Justice PC Ghosh interrupted him and said that we are not considering collegium right now
 sunwaayee ke dauraan jetali kii ore se pesh atorni general mukul rohtagi ko ek shabd bhi bolne kii jarurat nahi padi
 It may be noted that Arvind Kejriwal accused Arun Jaitleeper of involvement in scam in DDCA
 bhaajapa saansad kirti aaazaad bhi kejariwal ke saath aa gayi the
 The party had acted on Kirti and Jaitley had filed a defamation suit against Arvind Kejriwal
 kejariwal ne hai court main daayar yachika main kaha tha ki ek saath do maamle chalane ke kaaran aapraadhik karrwai par roak lagaai jaae

 On the last ball of the first over of Pat Cummins, Rohit Sharma (0) was caught by Adam Jampa on the third man boundary
 is samay tak team kaa khaataa bhi nahin khulaa tha
 In the second over of the innings, Shikhar Dhawan hit Nathan Coulter Nile and opened his account for the team, scoring seven runs in this over
 chauthe over main captain kohli ne nathan kulter nile ko do chauke jamaate hue vidarbha cricket stadium main maujuud cricketpremiyon ko khushi manaane kaa mauka diya
 Team India fell 4 wickets for 99 runs when Kohli and Shastri were happy, know why
 
 India has decided to field the same team that played in the first ODI
 duusari ore, australia ne do badlaav kiye hai, shaan morsh or nathan leone ko plaing ilevan main jagah di gai he
 Ashton Turner and Jason Behrendorf are excluded
 team india is match main apni badhat majboot karne ke iraade se utregi, is saath hi worldcup-2019 ke daavedaar khilaadiyon ke paas phir apni chhap chhodane kaa mauka hoga
 The victory in the first ODI match of Hyderabad was to boost the morale of the Indian team in many respects

 Opener Rory Burns has put England in a strong position on Friday on the second day of the first Test match of the Ashes series
 burns ke naabad 125 ranon kii badaulat england ne duusare din kaa ant hone tak apni pehali pari main chaar wicket ke nuksaan par 267 ran bana liye hai
 He is now 17 runs behind the score of 284 scored by Australia
 burns ke saath ben stokes 38 ran banaakar naabad hai
 Burns has faced 282 balls and hit 16 fours in his innings so far
 burns ne 71wein over kii teesri gend par ek ran le apana pehla test shatak puraa kiya
 Earlier his highest score was 84
 isi ke saath burns ashes padaarpan main shatak jamaane vaale england ke 10wein ballebaaj ban gaye hai
 He also became the first England batsman to score a century in Ashes series debut after 34 years
 burns se pehle 1985 main tim robinsan ne leeds main 175 ranon kii pari kheli thi
 With Stokes, Burns has added 73 runs for the fifth wicket so far
 isse pehle burns ne captain joe root ke saath duusare wicket ke liye 132 ranon kii saajhedaari kii
 England started the day with 10 runs without losing any wickets
 team kaa score 22 tak hi pahunchaa tha ki james patinson ne khatarnaak jesan roy (10) ko out kar england ko pehla jhatka diya
 From here Burns and Root strengthened their foundation for England with a century partnership
 ardhashatak puraa karne ke baad root 154 ke kul score par peter sidle kii gend par unako hi sidhaa kaich de baithe
 Root scored 57 runs off 119 balls
 unki pari main chah chauke shaamil rahe
 Joey Danley was able to score only 18 runs and became Pattinson's second victim
 jose butler bhi paanch ranon ke nijee score se aage nahin ja sake
 With these two successive setbacks, Australia seemed to dominate England for a while, but Burns and Stokes did not let that happen
 isse pehle, pehle din steven smith ne australia ko sammanjanak score tak pahunchaaya
 Smith, who lost his eight wickets for 122 runs, smashed 144 runs to save his team from early collapse by having half-century partnerships with Peter Siddle (44) and Nathan Lyon (12 not out)
 england ke liye stuart broad ne paanch or kris vokes ne teen wicket liye

 ' Use of the phone became the cause of death
 The celestial lightning fell on the person
 Can the use of mobile phone and taking selfie during the lightning flash cause your death? Actually, a similar case has come to light in Goa, where a couple from Delhi went to Goa for a holiday
 4 oktober ko goa ke ek bich par saikadon logon kii maujuudagi main akashiya bijli sirf chaitanya naam ke shaks par aakar giri, jo akashiya bijli kadakane ke dauraan mobile phone kaa istemaal kar rahaa tha or selfi le rahaa tha

 doctoron ne postmortem report main maut kii vajah akashiya bijli girnaa bataaya he
 Meanwhile, shocked by the death of her husband, his pregnant wife and sister-in-law are hospitalized, where both are being treated
 sawaal yah he ki kya bijli kadakane ke dauraan chaitanya ke mobile phone main kuch alag radiation tha, jiske chalate bijli sirf chaitanya par hi aakar giri yaa bijli kadakane ke dauraan mobile phone kaa istemaal maut kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 According to IG Goa Jaspal Singh, an incident occurred in Goa with a family from Delhi, in which a person named Chaitanya died due to lightning
 aisa bataaya ja rahaa he ki jis vakt chaitanya par bijli giri ve mobile phone chalaa rahe the
 Power may have fallen on Chaitanya due to mobile phone radiation, but this is the subject of investigation

 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne pichley 9 saal main pehali baar india today / aaj tak ko intervyuu diya
 In an exclusive interview given to India Today, Sonia Gandhi spoke with impunity about the ideology of Indira Gandhi, the controversies related to her, the current policy of the Congress, the need for changes in them and the decisions of the Modi government
 sonia gandhi ne ye intervyuu india today ke kansalting editor rajdeep saradesai ko elahabaad main aitihaasik swaraj bhawan main diya
 These are 9 big things from Sonia Gandhi's interview
 1
 When asked about the change in the Congress, when Sonia Gandhi was asked what kind of changes the Congress needs in its policies according to the changing times, Sonia Gandhi said that in every phase there are challenges and political faces of its kind
 isliye party main badlaav kii jarurat nahin he
 i think the current Congress strategy is absolutely correct
 2
 Sonia Gandhi also spoke on the future and future strategies of the Congress Party, saying that she hoped that the Congress Party would get a full majority in the next elections
 sonia gandhi ne kaha ki chunaav main haar-jeet laga rahata he
 3
 apatkaal se jude sawaal pardesh main immergency se jude sawaal par sonia gandhi ne kaha ki main kah nahin sakati ki aaj indiraji apatkaal ko kis tareeke se dekhti lekin agar is faisle se ve baichaiyn nahin hotin to chunaav kaa elaan nahin karti
 4
 vanshavaad ko badhaava diya?jab sonia gandhi ne ye poocha gaya ki kya indiraji ne congress main vanshavaad ko badhaava diya
 Sonia Gandhi said that this allegation is false, Jawaharlal Nehru was the leader of the people
 indira gandhi loktantric tareeke se chunakar ai thim, unhone dharmanirpekshata par bal diya
 People joined together and the party strengthened
 phir party ne ye tay kiya kise aage karnaa he
 Indira acted only in the interest of the poor
 5
 Comparison of Modi with Indira Gandhi When Parsonia Gandhi was asked that people say that Narendra Modi is a strong leader like Indira Gandhi? So Sonia said that i do not agree with such a comparison
 indira ji or unki raajnneeti ko mat bhuuliye
 She became Congress president, then PM
 lekin unka majaak banaaya gaya
 He was humiliated
 party ke bheetar hi unhen nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 But he did not give up, compete and won
 6
 Inspired by the family: In the Congress party, dynasticism and coming to the politics of her family, Sonia Gandhi told Babaki that the way the doctor comes from the family of the doctor, the family of the professor likes to go into the field of education
 In all areas, people follow the footsteps of their family members
 sonia gandhi ne kaha ki haalanki, raajnneeti main sthiti thodi alag hoti he
 Here you are selected democratically
 7
 Background of the freedom struggle: Sonia Gandhi said that Indira ji was raised during the freedom struggle
 unhone bachapan main vanar sena banaai or schuli chaatr-chaatraon ko ekajute kar swatantraaa sangram se joda
 She also went to jail several times
 sonia gandhi ne kaha ki rahul or priyanka main indira ji jaisi kii khaasiyaten hai
 But i will tell this in detail when i write the book
 8
 Full support from Indira ji Speaking on family issues, Sonia Gandhi said that i came from a completely different culture and family background but Indira ji supported me completely
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne kaha ki jaisaa soniyaji dikhti thi usase bilkul alag unka vyavhaar tha
 Indira ji understood their problems regarding language, culture
 9
 Sonia Gandhi also spoke about her dislike of Indira Gandhi, Indira Gandhi, who was associated with art and said that Indiraji was interested in music, classical and folk art and environment

 As the nectar was released after churning the sea, we are sure that the nectar will come out
 jinako janaa he vah chhodkar jaaenge lekin jo party kii vichaardhaara ke saath hai, vah party main rahenge
 On the resignation of Urmila Matondkar, Sanjay Nirupam said that it was unfortunate that his letter which he had written to the Mumbai president was leaked
 yah niztaa kaa sawaal he or aisa nahin hona chahie tha
 As far as the leaders whom he has accused, i can tell you with a claim that he has worked very hard for the Congress
 sanjay nirupam ne kaha ki unako yah galat jaankaree he, unako koi pad par niyukt kiya gaya he
 i would again request that he consider his decision
 istife par unhone kaha ki iske liye milind devda ko javabdeh tehraana chahta hum
 He removed me by running a campaign, got himself appointed and now withdrew before the assembly elections
 kripashankar ke istife par sanjay nirupam ne kaha ki kripashankar kii khabar main aapse sun rahaa hum

 24-year-old Prerna Kumar, sitting with a group of rural housewives and trying to understand her dialect, is discussing cleanliness as well as how she can make some extra money
 abhi saal bhar pehle hi ve noida kii ek research form main apni naukari se khush thim
 She felt that she had achieved what she wanted
 2010 main baio-technology main grajuation ke baad gudgaanv kii is ladki kii koi or acadmic mahatvakanksha nahin rah gai thi

 It will take them a few more months to complete this course, but XLRI has already provided them many practical opportunities to improve their qualifications

 Their mission? Teach them to understand the importance of using sanitary pads and make money from it
 kaise? jaisaa exelarai kii chaatra samajhaati hai, ‘‘in auraton ko pad ke istemaal ke liye raji karaane ke baad paas-pados ke gaanvon kii mahilaon ko pad bechakar
 "prerna and her team, secretary of xlri's CII Young Indians Society, are working towards creating a sustainable livelihood model for rural women
 do maheene pehle jab institute ke chaatro ne pehali baar swahaspur kii mahilaon main sainitory napkin vitarit karne ke liye kuch hajaar rupye jutaaye the to unhone paaya ki mahilaayein ‘‘ajanabiyon ke saath is ajeeb se vishay par’’ baat karne kii icchhuk nahin hai
 But it took only three sessions to persuade women to get free napkins
 ab ek korporate house ne apane siesaar program ke tahat swahaspur main biodigradable napkin banane vaali utpaadan ikai lagane kaa vaada kiya he
 Prerna tells the women, "the machine will produce 1,500 napkins daily
 aapako utpaadan ke liye har maheene main sirf paanch din nikaalane ke baad baaki ke 25 din marketing main kharch karne kii jarurat hogi
 Remember, you can earn money only after being successful in selling
 ’’ mahilaayein muskaraate hue sahmati jataati hai
 It is just the beginning but Prerna and her team, along with NGO Seeds (socio Economic and Education Development Society) of Jamshedpur, are sowing the seeds of positive entrepreneurship among the women of xlri's adopted village of Swashpur

 magar dobaaraa fail hone par hamen uskaa naam kaatna padaa
 "they say that other students intervened thereafter
" uske achche bhavishya ke liye unhone aapas main chanda ikattha kar 4
 5 lakhs
 jutaaye
 Seeing their feelings, the school also decided to contribute as much to that student
 jeshuit socity ke fadar queen enrit ne 1949 main exelarai kii sthapana kii thi, jiskaa mukhya uddeshy naitikta, eemaandaaree or profeshnal utkrushtataa se judi shiksha dena he

 Apart from this, it is also a direct violation of animal rights

 India, who have been stuck on ciphers for 20 years in Test cricket, did not have an easy 100-win journey and had to undergo many ups and downs before joining the top teams in this traditional format of the game

 India completed their half-century of victory by defeating Sri Lanka in Lucknow in January 1994, but then averaged only 17
 42 pratishat tha
 India, however, had made a strong place for itself in Test cricket by then and perhaps that is why it took 145 matches and 15 years to reach the milestone of victory and 34 percent of its win during this period
 48 rahaa
 The period after 2000 was a huge success for the Indian Test team and during this time he played 102 Tests, out of which he won 39 and in 27 he lost

 manoj tiwarine kaha ki congress jo ye bayaan de rahi he, usase ye saaf jaahir hota he ki unki baukhalaahat kis kadar bad rahi he
 Both parties know that it is not easy to contest PM Modi in 2019, and both parties are cheating the people of Delhi as before
 manoj tiwari ne ye bhi aarope lagaaya ki aam aadmi party or congress donon ek hai
 Now the people of Delhi have also come to know clearly how they are fooling the people
 dilli kii janata pareshaaniyon se jujh rahi he
 The scarcity of water has made the lives of people miserable
 bijli ke bade hue bill se dilliwaale trast hai
 Tanker Mafia is working in Delhi and the public is craving drop by drop
 bataa den ki ajay maakan ne aam aadmi party ke saath kisi bhi prakaar ke gathbandhan se inkaar karte hue kaha ki 'aap' ke saath kisi tarah ke gathbandhan kaa koi sawaal hi nahin uthta he
 He said that Kejriwal has created a demon named Modi
 patrkaar tarun tejpal ke khilaaf yon shoshan maamle main jaanch kar rahi mahila adhikari ne shikaayat darj karai he ki jaanch ke dauraan tejpal ne unhen dhamkee di thi
 Panaji Police on Wednesday registered a case of non-cognizable offense of threatening under section 506 of the Indian Penal Code against Tejpal following a complaint by police officer Sunita Sawant
 sunita ne 31 november se 10 disambar 2013 tak tejpal se police hiraasat ke dauraan poochtacha kii thi or unka aarope he ki tejpal ne poochtacha ke dauraan unhen dhamkaaya
 a police officer said that Sunita had also told this to the sessions court during the hearing on Tejpal's bail plea and the judge mentioned it in the order dismissing the petition
 kendriya swasthya rajyamantri anupriya patel ne uttar pradesh sarkaar kii ore se gathit saamaajik nyaay samiti kii report par sawaal uthaaya he
 He demanded the government to conduct a census on the basis of caste
 saath hi unhone kaha ki aisa nahin hone par yah mana jayega ki bijepi is samiti kii report ke jariye pichhadon ko baantnaa chaahati he
 Anupriya, the patron of Apna dal-sonelal, a constituent of the bjp-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) of the Center and Uttar Pradesh, said this while addressing the activist conference here
 unhone kaha ki pichley saal rajya sarkaar ko saunpi gai saamaajik nyaay samiti kii report main pichde varg ko pichhadaa, ati pichhadaa or sarvaadhik pichhadaa shreniyon main baantne kii sifarish kii he
 He said that his party is not against the classification of reservation, but it cannot happen without studying the population of castes
 jatiyon kii gananaa kii mangpatel ne kaha ki agar sarkaar ne jatiyon kii aabaadi kaa koi adhyayan kiya he to vah use janata ke saamne rakhe
 If not done, there is no basis for the recommendations of the Social Justice Committee
 aarakshan ke vargeekaran ke liye jaateey janaganana karaani hi hogi
 If needed, reservation of backward should be increased by 27 percent
 agar sarkaar aisa nahin karti he to uski manshaa par sawaal uthenge
 We will assume that the BJP wants to divide the backward in the name of reservation
 anupriya ne kaha ki unka bhi maananaa he 'jisaki jitani sankhya baari, uski utani hissedari' honi chahie
 Reservation should be available only in proportion to the population
 maaloom ho ki rajya kii yogi adityanath sarkaar ne may 2018 main nyaayamurti raghavendra kumaar kii adhyakshata main chaar sadasyeey samiti gathit kii thi
 Its purpose was to study the possibilities of providing reservation in backward class reservation
 samiti ne apni report main pichhadon ko teen shreniyon main baantne kii sifarish kii thi
 However, there is no detailed information about all his recommendations

 iske baavjood pakistan kii ore se mulaakaat kii tay baton kaa ulanghan kiya gaya
 The Pakistani press was allowed to come to Kulbhushan's family, who were harassing him with false accusations
 jabaki donon deshon ke bich yah tay tha ki media ko paas aane nahin diya jayega
 Lashing Pakistan, Ravish Kumar said that in the name of security, Mangalasutra, Bindi, clothes of Kulbhushan's wife and mother were also changed
 jab bhi wo kulbhushan kii maa apane bete se apni bhashaa marathi main baat karne kii koshish karti thi, unhen baar-baar tok diya jaataa tha
 Even his shoes were not returned
 videsh mantralay ne kaha ki baithak se pehle bharat ke dipti hai kamishnar jepi singh ko mulaakaat se alag kiya gaya, jabaki ye pehle se hi tay tha ki ve maujuud rahenge
 However, they were allowed to join after the Indian authorities intervened

 meeting 3 ghante (subah 9: 30- 12: 30) tak chali
 The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed the petition of Haryana mlas Abhay and Ajay Chautala
 unhone is yachika main kaha tha ki aay ke gyaat sroton se adhik sampatti jutaney ke maamle main unke khilaaf karrwai shuru karne se pehle kendriya jaanch beuro ko vidhansabhadhyaksh kii ijaajat leni hogi
 Along with this, a bench of Justice VS Sirpurkar and Justice TS Thakur cleared the way for the Federal Investigation Agency to take action against the mlas of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD)
 abhaya or ajay haryana ke purv mukhyamantri om prakaash chautaala ke putr hai or dilli kii ek adaalat main unke khilaaf mukadmaa chal rahaa he, jisamen unke khilaaf aarope pehle hi nirdhaarit kiye ja chuke hai
 Earlier, his plea was rejected by the Punjab and Haryana High Court
 das varshon ke faasale par mujhe ratan tata se do dfa milane kaa mauka mila
 From this meeting, it became clear in my mind that they are not bound by any protocol or high-down position
 pehali mulaakaat dilli ke indira gandhi hawaondde ke puraane antarararshtriya terminal par maharaja lounj main hui thi or duusari, america raashtrapati baraak obama ke bhartiya kaarobaar jagat ko sambodhit karne ke dauraan mumbai ke trident hotel main reagal bollroom kii pehali qatari main
 On both occasions, he simply sat on the empty seat next to me and nobody noticed
 unke loktantric or khule swabhaav kii vajah se hamaare bich baatcheet kaa silsilaa shuru hua
 At the end of the conversation i requested him to read some of my recent articles / books
 or main yah baat sweekaar karnaa chaahunga ki khud apane sankoch kii vajah se hi main unhen ye samagriyaan bhej nahin paaya
 i hope and i believe they will understand it
 mujhe lagata he ki is tarah ke aatmavishvaas or dikhavebaaji se dur hone ke unke swabhaav kii vajah he sukh-samruddhi ke bich unka laalan-paalan, awwal skulon-collejon main padhai, iske baad shop floor main waapas lautne par tata steel ke saamaanya karmiyon ke saath kandhe se kandhaa milakar kaam karnaa
 Families belonging to other business groups should also follow their example, rather than bringing their descendants to the top positions of management
 meraa maananaa he ki is anubhav or feedback kii vajah se hi ratan tata ko dridhtaa se aage badaae kaa saahas mila, jab unhone chairman banane ke baad un taqatvar kshatrapon ko saadhaa jo tata samooh ke kaarobaar ke bade hisse par niyantran rakhte the
 This work required not only indomitable courage but also clarity of purpose and visionary vision
 ve isamen lacheelaapan laane ke alaava tata ke kaarobaar ko global pratiyogita main shaamil karne or use ek vaastavik bahurashtriya company main kaamyaab rahe
 This shows his steely resolve, which was generally hidden due to his low-speaking nature and well-known attempt to stay away from fame
 apni aadhuniktaa, apane swapndarshi nazariye or desh kii tarakkee ke liye apni chintaa kii vajah se ve apane baraabar ke logon main ek oonchai par najar aate hai
 Perhaps because of this rich vision, very few people stay in the current Indian business world than them
 ve apane senior management ko is baat ke liye prerit karte hai ki ve doorgaami lakshya par apni najar rakhen, is purna vishwaas ke saath ki bazaar aage badhegaa or aage chalakar in prayaason kaa fal milegaa
 He has received tremendous recognition both at home and abroad, not only because he expanded an already well-established empire, but because Tata became synonymous with Indian progress under his leadership
 global mandandon par aage badhate hue unhone shodh or anusandhan ko badhaava diya, takneekee kii gaharaai par jor diya or sabase mahatvapurn baat, apane senior management ko swaittata or swaamitv kii bhaavana di
 However, he included rigorous accountability with this
 unhone kaaron, hotalon, software aadi ke apane brands ke vikaas kaa rasta chunaa or tata kii global str par maujuudagi kaayam kii
 Moving forward on this strategy, Ratan Tata understood that Indian industry could not take the cover of protectionist policies for long
 duniya kii arthvyavastha ke saath bhartiya arthvyavastha ke lagaataar badhate sampark ke bich unhone global str kii pratispardhaa ko apnaane par jor diya chaahe koi company gharelu bazaar main kaam kar rahi ho yaa videshi bazaar main
 This is a weighty strategy that other Indian business groups should also seriously consider
 bhartiya arthvyavastha ke lagaataar jari aadhunikeekaran main ve bhartiya samaaj ke sabase aadhunik or unnat varg ke pratik ban gaye
 The passion with which he brought the Nano project for the needs of the lower middle class, a "clean" water purifier, an affordable solution for poor families, and contributed to the work of several foundations run by Tata group companies and the Parsi community, This shows his concern for the residents of India
 unka tarika yah rahaa ki garibon or kam sampann logon kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye sabase unnat vaigyanik or takneekee samaadhaan uplabdh kiya jaae
 This is in sharp contrast to the thinking of those who show false mercy towards marginalized people and consider it appropriate to just donate as a solution
 koi yah tark de saktaa he ki ratan tata kaa lagbhag puri tarah se dhyaan tata samooh ko khadaa karne main rahaa or unhone bhartiya korporate jagat ke saamne aane vaale vyapak masalon par paryaapt dhyaan nahin diya
 In his second innings, he can use his stature and social reach to inspire greater self-regulation and higher ethical standards in the Indian industry
 akele isse hi kaamkaaj main sudhaar aane kii sambhaavna he or kanoon-vyavastha sahit jan sevaaon kii gunvattta main lagaataar aa rahi durbhagyapurna giravat kii disha palati ja sakati he
 It is quite clear that they themselves lead by example, not by preaching or expressing public opinion on any issue
 jab telecom sector ke prakaran kaa khulaasa hua to ve bhi desh main kul milakar bane kaarobaari maahaul se aprabhavit nahin rah sake
 This made him realize the truth of this Indian proverb, "no matter how much you try in the cell of Kajal, the stain of Kajal should be worn
" ’’ mujhe puraa bharosa he ki meri tarah lakhon madhyavargeey bhartiya bhi yahi chaahate honge ki ve aam taur par bhartiya kaarobaar jagat or khaskar bade kaarobaari gharaanon kii saamaajik chhavi ko badalane ke liye netritv karen
 Certainly, i am not suggesting that they join politics (why did it come to mind?) But they can lead the Indian business in a simple way to bring about progressive and moral change in the country Become the leader of
 unako mili kai sammaan or aword or unke vishaal antarrashtriya kad ko dekhte hue lagata he ki ratan tata global poonjeevaad ke prayaason kaa bhi netritv kar sakate hai
 i hope they find it appropriate to lead a group of eminent people who present the vision that global capitalism is more relevant in the changing times and will persist in the following decades

 There is a lady cleaning worker in my office washroom who often keeps asking me questions

 Bansgaon Lok Sabha seat is one of the most backward parliamentary seats in Uttar Pradesh and like other seats, most of the voters here are giving importance to the caste conditions than the development works and use their franchise on the same basis
 
 haalanki mukhyamantri yogi adityanath se sansadeey jila gorakhpur kaa hissaa hone ke kaaran is seat kaa mahatv bad jaataa he
 CM Yogi has the responsibility of winning this seat along with Gorakhpur
 aazaadee ke baad se hi anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit is sansadeey seat par bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kaa paanch baar kabja rahaa he or uske pratyaashee kamalesh paswan is baar jeet kii hetric lagane ke iraade se maidan main utre hai
 Kamlesh has won the Lok Sabha elections in 2009 and 2014
 unki najar chunavi jeet kii hetric par he to yahaan 5 saal pehle vaali jang phir se ladi ja rahi he, bas is baar chunavi bisaat alag ho gai he, lekin maidan main utre bade chehre vahi hai
 SP-BSP alliance This time, long before the announcement of Lok Sabha election dates, there was a revolutionary change in the politics of Uttar Pradesh when the anti-socialist Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party decided to contest elections together in the state by forming an alliance
 donon dalon ke gathbandhan ke tahat yah sansadeey seat bahujan samaaj party ke khate main ai
 BSP had earlier nominated Doodh Nath Prasad from here, but he was an outsider and he was unable to align with the party workers
 is kaaran party ne sanghathan str par logon se feedback liya or phir bada faisla lete hue apana ummidavaar badal daalaa
 BSP announced to field former minister Sadal Prasad in place of Dudhanath
 purv mantri sadal prasad sthaneey raajnneeti ke dhurandhar netaa rahe hai or 2014 ke chunaav main basapa ke hi tikat par ladate hue unhone kamalesh paswan ko kadi takkar di thi
 BJP candidate Kamlesh Paswan's younger brother and Bansgaon MLA Vimlesh Paswan told Aaj Tak that the alliance based on caste will be eliminated from here
 kamalesh ji badi jeet hasil karte hue jeet kii hetric lagaayenge
 He will get a bigger win this time than last time
 haalanki vimalesh paswan ke ulat sthaneey patrkaar or gorakhpur kii raajnneeti ko najadik se dekhne vaale sunil pandey kehete hai ki bansgaanv main sapa-basapa gathbandhan kaa jor he or bijepi ko yahaan se kadi takkar mil rahi he
 Sunil Pandey says that the Paswan family was an MP for 15 years from here, but there was no concrete development work here
 raajnneetik viraasat kii gavaahbansgaanv kii chunavi jang main romaanch us samay aa gaya jab congress ummidavaar kush saurabh kaa namakan hi khaarij ho gaya
 a total of 11 candidates had filed papers in this parliamentary seat, but now there is a fight between only 4 candidates
 kamalesh paswan or sadal prasad ke alaava yahaan par pragatisheel samaajawaadee party (lohia) ke surendra prasad or nirdaleey pratyaashee lalchand prasad apni kismat aajamaa rahe hai
 In a way, this seat is becoming a witness to the political legacy because before that, in the 1996 Lok Sabha elections, his mother Subhavati Paswan won the Lok Sabha elections for the first time on behalf of the family
 yah baat alag he ki subhavati tab samaajawaadee party main thim or unheen ke tikat par jeet hasil kii thi
 Kamlesh's father Om Prakash Paswan was one of the prominent leaders of Gorakhpur region in the 90s and was an MLA from Maniram assembly constituency (1989-1991 and 1993)
 lekin 1996 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bansgaanv main prachaar main dauraan unki hatya kar di gai thi
 After the murder his wife Subhavati Devi entered the ground and won
 aarthik rup se badahaal bansgaanv ke sthaneey muddon main berogari, krishi kii badahaali pramukh rup se shaamil he
 After working in the cement sector, Vinay Pratap Singh, who is going to form his own company and enter politics in a few months, says that Bansgaon area comes in the backward areas of the state and there is no such thing as Vikas
 har baar kii tarah shuruyaat vikaas se hoti he or jati par aakar khatm ho jaati he
 Talking about the development work in the 'SP-BSP alliance ineffective' area, MLA Vimlesh Paswan, while talking to Aaj Tak, says that the promises made by Kamlesh ji have been fulfilled with the help of the Modi government at the center
 modi ji ke netritv main kshetra main jo vikaas kaary hua he uske dam par bansgaanv ke saath-saath gorakhpur main bijepi ko banpar jeet milane ja rahi he
 MLA Vimlesh is currently busy campaigning for his elder brother and believes that the SP-BSP alliance will not get anything from here
 sapa-basapa ke saath gathbandhan main rashtriya lokdal bhi shaamil he
 Anshuman Singh, the state spokesperson of Rashtriya Lok Dal and hailing from Bansgaon, says that this time there is a thorn battle in the area due to the alliance
 haalanki haar-jeet kaa antar bahut zyada nahin rahane vaala he
 On the other hand, journalist Sunil Pandey says that no concrete work has been done in Bansgaon in the last 10 years
 unka daawa he ki chilloopar main ek rajkeey skool ko chhod diya jaae to kshetra main kehane ko koi thos kaam nahin hua
 The roads here are broken, and electricity is also less
 is baar bijepi kii haalat yahaan par patali lag rahi he
 At the same time, local journalist Durgesh Yadav also believes that the effect of SP-BSP alliance is visible in Bansgaon
 kamalesh kii tulana main sadal prasad zyada kaddavar netaa hai
 'personality of Sadal Prasad' This time the election has become thorny due to alliance with SP, change of candidate from BSP, dismissal of Congress candidate and Sadal Prasad himself being local
 sadal prasad bansgaanv vidhansabha seat (surakshit) se hi chunaav jitkar 2007 main basapa sarkaar main rajyamantri rahe the
 Regarding Sadal Prasad, Anshuman Singh says that his simple personality also goes in his favor, while Kamlesh is rarely in the area and meeting less of the local people can go against him
 bansgaanv sansadeey seat ke jatigat sameekaran kii baat karen to yahaan par anya pichhadaa varg (obisi) ke sabase zyada matadaata rahete hai
 8 of the obcs here
 34 lakh to anusuchit jati ke 2
 There are 50 lakh voters
 savarna varg se 5 lakh matadaata yahaan par hai to muslim samaaj se kareeb 1
 There are 50 lakh voters
 durgesh yadav maanate hai ki bansgaanv main jati kaa factor kaam karegaa
 Both Kamlesh and Sadal come from the same fraternity, but Sadal has a good hold in the upper caste and continues to meet them, so Sadal Prasad can prove to be nineteen from Kamlesh
 loksabhaa kshetra ke tahat 5 vidhansabha siten aati hai jisamen gorakhpur kaa chilloopar, bansgaanv, chaurichaura or devaria kaa rudrapur, barhaj vidhansabha kshetra shaamil he
 Is this time Modi wave Prime Minister Narendra Modi is campaigning all over the country and he is contesting elections in his own name
 aise main bansgaanv ke vidhayak vimalesh paswan jahaan daawa karte hai ki bansgaanv hi nahin puure purvanchal or pradesh main modi lahar he or unheen ke dam par ham phir se jeetenge or centre main sarkaar banegi, lekin anshuman singh kaa daawa he ki yahaan par modi lahar jaisi koi baat nahin he
 Modi's mood in 2014 is not visible this time
 patrkaar durgesh bhi maanate hai ki is baar modi lahar jaisi koi baat nahin he
 Sunil Pandey also agrees with Durgesh and says that Modi wave is proving to be ineffective this time
 bansgaanv ke sansadeey itihaas kii baat karen to is loksabhaa seat par 1962 se ab tak hue 14 loksabhaa chunaav main congress 6 baar chunaav jeet chuki he
 Whereas BJP opened the account of victory from here in 1991
 tab bijepi ke tikat par raaj narayan saansad bane the
 After that the BJP is winning elections from here for 2 consecutive times in 2009 and 2014
 vaise yah seat mahavir prasad ke naam se jaani jaati he, jo ek samay pradesh ke bade dalit netaaon main ek the
 He managed to win the Lok Sabha elections 4 times from here, but once he was defeated
 mahavir prasad ne aakhri baar 2004 main jeet hasil kii thi
 The BJP seat is also known for Om Prakash Paswan ahead of the SP-BSP vote, after whose murder his wife Subhavati Paswan (1996) became an MP from here
 maa ke raajnneetik sanyas lene ke baad unke bete kamalesh paswan lagaataar 2 baar (2009 or 2014) se loksabhaa chunaav jeet rahe hai
 Talking about the 2014 election on Bansgaon parliamentary seat (reserved), bjp's Kamlesh Paswan defeated Sadal Prasad of BSP
 tab chunaav main kamalesh ko kul 47
 6 per cent votes i
e
 4,17,959 votes were received while Sadal Prasad got 2,28,443 (26
 0%) mat hasil hue
 In this way, Kamlesh took 1,89,516 (21
 6%) maton ke antar se yah jeet hasil kii thi
 sp's Gorakh Prasad Paswan finished third with 15
 2% vot (1,33,675) mili
 There were a total of 12 candidates in the fray
 is baar sapa-basapa saath chunaav lard rahe hai to 5 saal pehle mili maton ko jod diya jaae to is gathbandhan ko 36
 8 per cent votes were received while BJP alone got 47
 6 fisadi vot mili
 Om Prakash Rajbhar, president of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, an ally of the Yogi government in UP, has announced to support the SP-BSP alliance here
 is tarah se agar pichhali baar kii tarah is baar bhi vot padate hai to kamalesh ko sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke aage jeet hasil karne main koi dikkat nahin aegi
 Although it is being said that a large section of the local upper caste MP is angry with Kamlesh Paswan, but when it comes to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, voters of this class turn in favor of BJP
 to vahiin sadal prasad kii savarna varg ke saath-saath obisi or essi varg main acchhee pakad he
 In the changed political equation in the state, the path ahead for BJP is looking to be easier this time like last time
 haalanki yahaan ke chunavi jang main congress ke nahin hone se muqabla trikoniya nahin ho sakaa, lekin dilachasp jarur rahegaa

 a family of Salman lives in south Kashmir, thousands of kilometers away from Salman Khan's house in Mumbai
 ravivaar ko 75 saal kii jaayna begum kii khushi dekhte hi banati he
 Despite the chilly morning, there is a lot of enthusiasm inside Jaina on this special day
 vah kahati hai ki salmaan kaa janmdin he or unke paas 'bajrangi bhaijan' ke liye sirf duaen hai
 Actually, Zaina Begum is the same old and widowed woman, whose six-member family was adopted by Salman Khan during the shooting of his film 'bajrangi Bhaijaan'

 Today he has a house of his own and his grandson Gauhar Ahmed has now started working as well
 kehane kii jarurat nahin he ki yah sab 'prem dilavaale' ke sneh kaa hi nateeja he
 Salman, who came to meet after reading the letter, said that in the month of april-may, in the midst of his legal troubles, the actor Salman Khan was shooting the film in the Kashmir Valley
 tab jaayna begum ne salmaan se mulaakaat kii thi or uske parivaar kii aarthik sahaayta karne kii apil kii thi
 The woman had also written a letter to Salman earlier and mentioned her family's problems
 jaayna apane 40 saal kii vidhwaa beti or uske 4 bacchon ke saath rahati hai
 It is said that after reading Zaina's letter, Salman expressed his desire to meet this family and during the shoot in the valley, Salman reached out to meet him
 khaas baat yah rahi ki salmaan ne na sirf jaayna ke parivaar kii aarthik madad kii, balki parivaar ko god le liya or ghar banavaane se lekar jaayna ke 18 saal ke pote gauhar ahamed ko naukari bhi dilwaai
 Zayna, who treated Salman like her son, was moistened when Salman was convicted by a sessions court in a hit and run case thousands of kilometers away and sentenced to jail

 ghar kharidaaron se paise lekar use project main lagane kii jagah kahin or lagane vaale yaa gaban karne vaale developers par ab real estate reguletory athurity uttar pradesh yani rera karrwai karne ke mood main he
 UP Rera has decided to issue show cause notices to 48-48 developers of Noida and Greater Noida found guilty of fund diversion
 upi rera un developers ko notice jari karegaa jinhone graahakon kaa paisa project main lagane kii jagah use kisi duusare project yaa kaam ke liye istemaal kiya he
 In fact, earlier this year, the Noida Authority had conducted an audit with international audit firm Curry & Brown to find out the culprits guilty of fund diversion
 is audit report ke pehle charan main noida main fund diavarjan karne vaale 11 developers ke naam saamne aae the
 The names of these developers included 3C, Omaxe, Unitech
 haalanki duusare charan main athurity ne fund diavarzan main shaamil rahe developers ke naa to naam bataae or naa hi koi thos karrwai kii
 His customers asked for information about the fund diversion from the authority in RTI, but they were refused to give based on the objection of the developer
 audit ke baad se thande baste main pade is maamle main ab rera badi karrwai karne ja rahaa he
 According to UP RERA member Balwinder Kumar, first of all, show cause notice will be sent to all 96 developers
 iske baad santoshjanak jawaab naa milane par rera unke khilaaf sampatti kurk karne se lekar diwalia ghoshit karne kii prakriya tak shuru karne kaa nirdesh de saktaa he
 That is, this decision of RERA is sure to create panic among the fraudulent developers
 maheene ke pehle din selary ke liye bainko ke baahar logon kii bheed umad padi
 To overcome the crowd, the Punjab National Bank branch at Ashoka Road adopted a way of issuing tokens to the people
 pienbi ne apni branch ke graahakon ko ek token jari kiya, jisase ye pataa chal sake ki kya unka acount us shakha main he yaa nahin
 Like PNB, this arrangement also appeared in many other banks, as banks were also expected to reach more people on the first day of the month
 haalanki sutron ke mutabik jitne cash kii jarurat bainkon ko pehali taarikh ke hisaab se thi, utana cash baikon main pahunchaa hi nahin, jabaki selary kaa din hone kii vajah se bheed roj ke mukaable zyada rahi
 Central employee Sumit Kumar told that on behalf of the bank, he was told in line that 24 thousand rupees would not get cash, because the cash is less and people are more
 isliye bank ne das hazaar rupye cash kii limit fiks kar di he
 Meaning people are not getting even half the cash from the government's fixed limit
 bainkon ne tay kii nikasi kii limitkanot place or parliament street ke aasapaas lagbhag sabhi bainkon kii haalat thi
 Due to less cash, banks decided the cash limit on their own
 kai jagah ye das hazaar rupye thi, to kai jagah paanch hazaar se do hazaar tak bhi thi
 a person brought money from SBI branch told that he had taken the amount of 15 thousand in his check, but the bankers cut it and gave him only five thousand from the same check

 Salary accounts were also paid less than 24
 mukesh kumaar ke mutabik unhen zyada cash kii jarurat thi, unke liye 24 hajaar kii rakam bhi kam thi, lekin bank ne unhen sirf aath hajaar rupye die
 Significantly, the RBI and the government's claims of arrangement on the first date did not live up to the expectations of the people, as not only the line was lengthened but the cash was also cut

 Pujara started well with a four off Swan, but this off-spinner forced him to go ahead and play the shot
 gend ne balle kaa andruni kinaaraa liya or short leg par jaani beresto ne baayin taraf dive lagaakar kaich kar diya
 Tendulkar hit Panesar for two fours but the spinner did not take long to avenge it

 Ojha then dismissed Bairstow (9), Samit Patel (26) and Peterson
 ojha ne nik kampton or jonathan traat ko bhi out kiya tha
 Bairstow's dismissal was controversial as the ball hit fielder Gambhir's helmet before it was caught
 ballebaaj iske tunrat baad pavilion laut gaya tha
 Ojha included Peterson cheaply in both innings in Ahmedabad
 yah ballebaaj aaj uskaa badla chuktaa karne ke mood main dikhaa

 baavjood iske wo apni umr ke har bachche se bahut alag he
 At the age of one year, he has got such a disease that he is different from them even as children of his age
 uske jananaang ek vayask kii tarah viksit hai
 The age at which children do not understand anything, this child has a desire for sex
 uskaa testosteron level kisi 25 saal ke shaks jitna he
 He has hair like adults on his face and body
 uske jananaangon ke bal bade hue he
 
 
 This child suffers from a rare hormonal condition precocious puberty
 daily mail kii khabar ke anusaar, atul ( badla hua naam) ke mata-pita ko kareeb chah maheene pehle uski is haalat ko lekar shaq hua
 His genitals were growing in an unusual way while his body was comparatively quite small
 bachche kii maa ne hindustan times ko die intervyuu main bataaya ki shuruyaat main unhen laga ki baccha kaaphi lanbaa-chaudaa he, isliye aisa ho rahaa ho
 Thinking of this, the parents did not take him to the doctor
 par lagbhag chah maheene baad ye saaf ho gaya ki kuch gadabad to jarur he
 Atul's mother says that her mother-in-law has cared for many children
 unhone kaha ki bachche kii growth normal nahin he or yahi vakt tha jab doctor ke paas jane kaa faisla kiya
 Precocious Puberty is a rare condition
 paanch saal kii umr main maa banane vaali peru kii leena medinako bhi yahi problem thi
 Initially her parents thought that Leena had a tumor in her stomach but she was pregnant
 atul kii doctor baisakhi rastogi ne samachar patr ko bataaya ki ye ek gambhir samasya he or isaki vajah se baccha aakraamak ho saktaa he
 Many times it is difficult to control him
 duusari condishan main aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki bachche kaa puraa vikaas hi nahin ho or wo teen yaa chaar foot kaa hi rah jaae
 Presently, medicines are being given to the child to relieve these symptoms
 doctoron kaa kahana he ki use ye davaaiyaan kam se kam tab tak to deni hi padengi jab tak wo ye samajhane ke laayak na ho jaae ki use kya beemaari he
 There is election atmosphere all over the country and big leaders of all parties are engaged in the election campaign

 Explain that along with the Lok Sabha elections in Odisha, elections are also being held for the state assembly
out of 147 seats odisha main vidhansabha kii 147 siton main se bijepi ne 142 siton ke liye ummidavaaron kaa naam ghoshit kar die hai
 Leaders of all parties are reaching Odisha to campaign in favor of their candidates
 odisha main loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav ke liye chaar charnon 11, 18, 23 or 29 april ko matdaan hona he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Odisha last Tuesday
 is dauraan unhone kaha ki congress or sattarudh biju janata dal (bijd) ne apane vot bank kii raajnneeti ke liye logon ko garib banaae rakhane kii sajeesh rachi he
 Modi while addressing an election meeting at Bhawanipatna in Kalahandi district said, “parties like Congress and BJD have conspired to keep the poor of the country poor
 unhone garibon ko dhokhaa diya
 He treated them like a vote bank
 "modi ne kaha ki odisha is baar uttar pradesh dwaara 2017 main rache gaye itihaas or 2018 main tripura dwaara rache gaye itihaas ko dohraane vaala he
 He appealed to the people to vote for the BJP to achieve the double engine development of the Center and the state
 chunaav kii har khabar milegi sidhe aapke inbox main
 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter bijepi kii sabase puraani sahyogi party shivasena ne mangalvaar ko elaan kiya ki 2019 ke loksabhaa or maharashtra ke vidhansabha chunaav main wo endie se alag hokar chunaav ladegi
 BJP is unimpressed by this decree of Shiv Sena
 party ke kisi bhi netaa ne is baat ko gambhirtha se nahin liya
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who is running the government on the strength of the Shiv Sena himself, also seemed unperturbed by this and in a conversation with Aaj Tak, he said that he has become accustomed to such things with the Shiv Sena
 shivasena-bijepi main 2014 se ai daraarshivsena ke rashtriya adhyaksh uddhav thakare ne mangalvaar ko rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main kaha ki main kasam khaataa hum ki apane dam par desh ke sabhi rajyon main chunaav ladenge
 Whether they win or lose, they will fight the elections on their own
 bataa den ki pichley teen dashak se bijepi or shivasena milakar congress kaa muqabla karti aa rahi hai
 Both lost and sometimes defeated congress-ncp
 lekin gathbandhan jas kaa tas bana rahaa
 bjp's allies moved away from him one by one, but the Shiv Sena remained close
 par maharashtra ke pichley vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne shivasena se alag hokar chunaav ladaa
 Although the two Phils are running the government together after the elections, the rift that formed in friendship remains the same
 shivasena 2014 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad se hi bijepi par lagaataar hamale karti aa rahi he
 Not only this, as much as the Shiv Sena did the policies of the BJP government and the personal attacks on PM Narendra Modi, the opposition Congress also did not
 iske baavjood donon dalon kaa gathbandhan barkaraar he
 Now when Shiv Sena passed the resolution in the party's executive on Tuesday, it claimed to contest all the Lok Sabha and all assembly seats in Maharashtra in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and win 25 Lok Sabha seats and 150 assembly seats on its own
 The BJP looked careless
 bijepi ke saath rahanaa shivasena kii majabooridarasal bijepi jaanati he ki maujuuda halaat main bijepi ke sang rahanaa shivasena kii majaburi he
 If the Shiv Sena separates, it will lose the power not only from the Center but also from the state
 vaicharik matbhedon ke chalate congress ke haath kaa saath bhi shivasena ko nahin mil sakegaa
 Muslim voters see both the BJP and the Shiv Sena keeping on the same scales
 isi tarah ensipi bhi shivasena ke sang nahin khadi hogi kyonki maratha vot ke liye donon ke bich pratidwandvita he
 In such a situation, the BJP is well aware that the Shiv Sena has no other option
 isiilie uddhav kii kasam ko party tavajjo nahin de rahi
 Whether the BJP is bigger than Shiv Sena or Maharashtra, BJP is no longer the previous BJP
 desh kii satta ke saath-saath 18 rajyon main bhi bijepi kii sarkarein hai
 As for Maharashtra, the BJP has separated from the Shiv Sena in the last assembly elections and measured its strength
 bijepi ne vidhansabha chunaav main sabase zyada122 siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 At the same time, Shiv Sena got 63 seats in its account
 loksabhaa chunaav donon ne saath ladaa tha tab rajya kii 48 siton main se 23 bijepi or 18 siten shivasena ne jiti thim
 Now BJP is assuming that if Shiv Sena separates in Lok Sabha then it will contest all the seats like assembly elections and it will get more seats than before
 shivasena ko tavajjo na dene ke peeche bijepi kii yahi vajah maani ja rahi he
 The central government has rejected BJP MP Varun Gandhi's appeal for further protection
 sansad main bhi uthaaya gaya maamalasarkaar ne varun kii maa menka gandhi ke un aaropon ko bhi nakaar diya he, jo unhone pradhanmantri ko likhe patr main lagaae the
 Maneka wrote in that letter that the Ministry of Home Affairs is adopting a lax attitude on Varun's threats
 isse pehle bijepi ne bhi mangalvaar ko varun kii suraksha badhaane kaa mudda sansad main uthaaya tha
 Sushma Swaraj, deputy leader of the party in the Lok Sabha, said that Varun Gandhi's life is in danger, so he should get better security
 philhal vaai koti kii suraksha29 varshiya varun gandhi ko vaai koti kii suraksha mili hui he, jiske mutabik unhen 24 ghante 3 suraksha guard, ek escort or pilot vaahan diya gaya he
 According to sources, this security has been found appropriate after review
 pradhanmantri ko likhe patr main menka ne chota shakeel giroh ke sharp shootaron kii dilli police dwaara giraftaar kiye jane kaa bhi zikr karte hue kaha tha ki ve varun ko nishaanaa bananaa chaahate hai
 However, the police denied the claim
 sarkaar ke ravaie se menka chintitamenka ne apane patr main kaha tha, "aapaki sarkaar ke udasin ravaiye se aashcharyachakit hum
 The Ministry of Home Affairs has taken these threats very lightly, which i am surprised
 " unhone kaha, "jab varun ne jab grih mantri se mulaakaat kii, to vah apane kartavyon ko lekar kaaphi rukhe or laaparvaah dikhe or unhen suchit kiya ki vah desh main harek aadmi kii raksha nahin kar sakate
 Suppose he wants Varun Gandhi to be killed

 Input: IANS rahul gandhi bahut maasoom hai or unhen jo bhi likhakar de diya jaataa he, vah usee ko manch par pard dete hai
 This is to say of Azam Khan, the senior cabinet minister of Uttar Pradesh government
 ajam khan sapa sarkaar par mujffarnagar main dange karaane ke congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke aaropon par palatwaar kar rahe the

 unhone rahul dwaara sarkaar par dange karaane kaa aarope lagaaye jane ke bare main kaha, 'desh main dangon kii neenv congress ne rakhi he
 The Congress, which has ruled the country for more than half a century since independence, has organized countless riots during this period

 kya aapaki hari-bhari balakani achaanak se suukh jaati he? kya aapke saath bhi aisa hota he ki jin paudhon ko aap bade chaav se lagaate hai wo kuch din to sahi-salaamat rahete hai lekin dhire-dhire sookhne lag jate hai? agar haa to sambhav he ki aap bhi vahi galtiyaan kar rahe hon jo amuman har koi karata he
 Those who are fond of balcony garden often make such mistakes, but if you want your balcony to be green, then only a little attention is needed: 1- Heap of small pots: It is often that the balcony People make small pots of pots in the circle of Kosundarbana
 isse khubsuurati to kya hi badhati hogi, alabatta paudhon kaa purna vikaas nahin ho pataa he
 In such a situation no plant is able to achieve its real growth and its beauty remains incomplete
 gamalon kaa dher lagane se behatar he ki kuch bade aakaar ke gamale rakhe jaaen, jisase paudhon ko badhane ke liye puri jagah mil sake
 2-selecting the right pots: It is very important to choose the pots right
 ekbar paudhe ko usamen laga dene ke baad uskaa vikaas gamale ke aakaar par nirbhar karata he
 There should be water hole at the bottom of the pot, so that the excess water goes out easily
 iske saath hi gamale main bhari jane vaali mitti kaa sahi chunaav kiya janaa behad mahatvapurn he
 Soil should be filled in pot in the pot and not on it
 3- galat paudhe kaa chayan:garden ko haraa-bharaa banaae rakhane ke liye sahi paudhe kaa chayan kiya janaa bhi mahatvapurn he
 Balcony should be thoroughly inspected before selecting the plant
 iske baad hi nursery se swasth paudhe kharidne chahie
 Before buying plants, you should know how much sunlight comes in your balcony and which plants need to be looked after
 agar aapaki balakani main tej dhoop aati he or aapane anjaane main shed luving plant kharid liye hai to in paudhon kaa lambey vakt tak haraa-bharaa bane rahanaa mushkil he
 4- Correct watering ratio: Planting water after planting is a fixed process, but you will be surprised to know that most of the plants in the pots rot due to lack of water or due to excessive amount of water
 kai baar to log niyamit rup se paudhon main pani dena hi bhul jate hai yaa phir kai baar itnaa pani daal dete hai ki paudhe kii jaden hi sad jaati hai
 Both conditions are bad for the plant
 5-sahi kitnashak kaa chunaav:sahi kitnashak kaa chunaav na karne kii sthiti main bhi paudha suukh jaataa he
 Many times it happens that a disease develops in the plant and it is not detected at the right time, due to which the plant dries up
 isliye ye jaruri he ki paudh kii dekharekh kii jaati rahe or andeh hone par kisi visheshgy se salaah lee jaae

 dilli metro main rojaanaa lagbhag 5 lakh vyapaaree safar karte hai or saath hi unke yahaan kaam karne vaale 2 se 3 lakh karmchaaree bhi rojaanaa metro train se safar karte hai
 Narang store, which trades auto parts at Kashmiri Gate, has 23 employees who commute daily by metro
 haal hi main metro kiraaya badhane ke baad aise karmchaariyon kii chintaa bhi kaaphi bad gai he
 Vijay Narang, who trades auto parts at Kashmiri Gate, has an interesting reason for the problem with the increase in Metro fares

 Vijay Narang says that 23 employees work in his shop and warehouse

 These days, due to GST, business is in a slump, in such a way, metro fare has become a new problem
 pichley kai saalon se metro main safar karne vaale vijay naarang kaa kahana he ki metro ab ek jarurat ban gai he or kiraaya badhaakar dmarsi blackmel kar rahaa he jabaki metro kaa kiraaya kai guna badhaane kii jarurat mahasoos nahin hoti he

 Rajesh explains that it is also difficult to celebrate the festival

 Gaurav, who works in an auto parts shop, travels by metro daily from Uttam Nagar to Kashmiri Gate
 gaurav kaa kahana he ki kiraaya badhaane se jeb par bada nuksaan pahonchega

 Sapna, who has been traveling in the metro for the last 7 years, says that her husband also travels a great distance in the metro

 It has become such a habit to travel in the metro that it is very difficult to use the bus or the rest of the public transport

 narendra modi jab pradhanmantri bane tab china ne khuli baahon se unki chunavi jeet kaa istakabal kiya tha
 Firstly, Modi was not an unknown figure to the Chinese leadership as he had visited the country four times as Chief Minister of Gujarat and openly appreciated the Chinese model
 iske alaava ek or baat thi jiske prati china paryaapt jaagruk tha or jise china ke ek ranneetikaar liyu jongui ne chunaav ke baad likhe apane ek bahuprachaarit stambh main washington dwaara shmodi ke saath kiye gaye nijee bhedbhaav ke taur par ginvaaya tha jiskaa sandarbh 2002 ke dangon ke baad unke vija par laga pratibandh tha
 Liu had said in his article that Modi as Prime Minister would not create tension between New Delhi and Washington, but like other Chinese, he also expected that the Modi government would rethink relations with the US
 aadha saal biit jane ke baad yah saaf ho chalaa he ki modi ne vastav main washington ke saath bharat ke sameekaran kii samiksha kii he, lekin us tareeke se nahin jaisi china ko ummid thi, balki unhone bilkul uske vipareet najariya apanaaya he
 The same thing is shocking for China
 america raashtrapati baraak obama kii bharat yatra ke alok main china yahaan badalati hui paristhitiyon kaa jayja teenon deshon ke jatil tripaksheeya sambandhon ke sandarbh main le rahaa he
 The move to invite Obama, the chief guest at the Republic Day parade (which is the first time an American president has been received), was nothing short of a surprise for China as its leaders and officials remember the last time and only Chinese The guest arrived in India in 1958
 china ke vishleshak is nyote ko ek nae rujhaan ke rup main dekh rahe hai jisaki shuruyaat japan ke pradhanmantri shinjo ebe ke saath modi kii garmjoshi bhari mulaakaat se hui thi jo china or japan ke bich ke tanaavon ke chalate china ke bheetar sarvaadhik alokapriy videshi netaa hai
 This was followed by a border dispute during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to India in September, derailing expectations of a renewed relationship between the two countries, which confirmed the trend
 november main apek shikhar sammelan main hissaa lene ke liye china ke raashtrapati shi kii ore se bheje gaye nyote ko modi ne thukraa diya jisase china kii ashankaon ko or bal mila
 In a recent article by scholar Yao Yuanmei at the International History Center in Shanghai, he said, "modi's absence at APEC has shocked people
" kuch log maanate hai ki yah rishton main giravat kaa sanket he
 Yan Zutang, a strategic expert at Singhua University who advises the government, believes such fears are unnecessary
 unhone india today ko bataaya, ‘‘bharat ek vaishvik takat he or vah kisi bhi dhade kaa anuyaayi nahin banegaa
 "india's tilt under an anti-china strategy with the US and Japan has been a matter of eternal concern for China's military establishment
" bharat ke ek aalaa adhikari kii maane to ‘‘iskaa koi aadhaar nahin he kyonki takreeban har vishay par america ke saath china kaa judaav bharat or america ke rishton ke mukaable kahin zyada gaharaa he
 "yan believes that India" will continue to work to balance the important countries
 ’’ is lihaaj se modi kii kootneeti ne ab tak china ko bhulaave main rakhaa he
 India had given its support to China in the plan to form Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, under which five rounds of talks were held between the two countries
 aisa is bank ke liye america virodh ke baavjood kiya gaya
 Along with this, India stood in opposition to China's "maritime Silk Route" plan which was intended to increase China's dominance in the region
 yah dikhaata he ki modi kii sarkaar ko is baat se zyada fark nahin padataa ki uske kadamon se china kii bhaawanaaon ko thes lag rahi he yaa nahin
 So far, it seems that China is giving concession to Modi due to confusion
 modi kii japan yatra par hallaa machaane waalon ko china kii communist party ke akhbaar libration ne ek samaj-boojh bhare vaakya se satark kiya tha, ‘‘ho saktaa he ki japan modi ko lekar utsahit ho kyonki vah unke saath milakar china ko niyantrit karne kii khwaahish rakhata he lekin modi kii dilchaspee japan ke nivesh or praudyogiki main he
 In this way, if we assess according to the intentions of both, then we will find that India and Japan are like a couple who are in the same bed when they sleep, but dreams are completely different
 ’’ Unidentified militants threw two grenades at the CRPF checkpoint in Old City area
