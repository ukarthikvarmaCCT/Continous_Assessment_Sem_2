 What is the point of telling Mahendra Pandey a Brahmin face while Kalraj Mishra? Is Mahendra Pandey a bigger leader than Kalraj Mishra or is Kalraj Mishra no longer a Brahmin leader? RSS chiefs are usually Brahmins
 bijepi main bhi kai brahman netaa sthapit hai
 Can not all these Brahmins bring votes in UP
 mujhe kai baar samaj nahin aata ki kis aadhaar par ham kisi kii jati ko raajnneeti se bada dekhne lagate hai
 If these mps have been formed on the basis of elections and caste, then from the first expansion after two years, it seems that not only Modi but Indian politics has no new idea
 do saansadon kii cycle se sansad aane kii tasviir kii kaaphi charchaa hui
 It is a commendable work without doubt
 lekin unhen paryaavaran kaa pratinidhi cheharaa banane se pehle kam se kam yah to dekh liya jaataa ki sarkaar kii paryaavaran kii nitiyaan kya hai
 What are their effects? cycle hi antim pratinidhi he to phir niti kya he
 By the way, Meghwal has been elected the best parliamentarian and has administrative experience
 lekin unke jaise tamaam dalit saansad jab dalit muddon ke samay saamne nahin aate to mantri banate hi kaise ye upi se lekar bharat ke tamaam daliton ke pratinidhi ban jate hai
 o experts, in this context, the Prime Minister should do this, that Sharma, Patel, Singh, Sinha of all the major castes should be made to sleep by making them ministers
 aisa nahin he ki main kuch alag tareeke se charchaa karata
 i would have been doing all these things if i were
 shaayad isiilie lag rahaa he ki bharat kii raajnneeti or uske vishleshak jad ho chuke hai
 They have no new scale
 hamaari raajnneeti main sab kuch hamaare paidaa hone se pehle tay ho chukaa he
 We have all come into the world to raise him! Every anchor is telling the other person right that you know UP better than others
 aap modi ko sabase behatar jaanate hai
 What are you saying, new experts, who know you better than all the people? tail me na!tippaniyan If politics is just a game of image and projection then the public should watch TV all day long
 use naukari, taraqqi or sasti padhai or saste aspataal kii jagah apni jati ke mantriyon ke naam passbook main likhte rahanaa chahie
 The ministers who have been made earlier also represent age, caste and experience
 wo bhi isi tarah se bataaye gaye
 What has been their performance on those scales? Anyone can tell Had Assam lost, would the Prime Minister and Shah resign? Aren't they already strong? If victory is the strength of their strength, then will Shah be sent to Gujarat after losing UP? centre hi nahin rajyon main bhi yahi hota he
 What is the good of the public due to this
 kya ye chehre kisi niti kaa bhi pratinidhitiv karte hai? kya inaki apni koi soch he? kya ye sabhi apane dam par chunaav jeetne kii kshamta rakhte hai? aaj upi ke jitne mantri jati or ilaake kaa cheharaa bataaye ja rahe hai koi dil par haath rakh kar kahe ki kya ye sabhi bina modi lahar ke 2014 main chunaav jeet jate? kya aapane chunaavon ke dauraan krishna raaj, mahendra pandey kaa naam suna tha? do teen din se sun rahe hai yaa varshon se? sabhi nae mantriyon ko shubhakamanaayen
 The BJP has the most Dalit mps
 phir rashtriya adhyaksh ko kumbh main samarasata snaan kii raajnneeti kyon kerani padi? kya unke saath baaki dalit saansad bhi snaan karne gaye the? upi ke kaaran dalit saansad mantri bane hai to udit raaj main koun-si kami thi? kya dalit hone ke kaaran inhen bada mantralay bhi milegaa? vitt rajya mantri banenge yaa samaaj kalyaan yaa bal kalyaan mantri hi banate rahenge
 Are these Dalit mps or ministers of state becoming cabinet ministers? What work the state ministers have is missing from sudden discussions

 Arun Jaitley and Kalraj Mishra have been described as Brahmin faces by these TV experts
 calraj mishra ke rahete hue mahendra pandey ko brahman cheharaa bataane kaa kya tuk he? kya mahendra pandey calraj mishra se bade netaa hai yaa calraj mishra ab brahman netaa nahin rahe? aresas pramukh praaia: brahman hi hote hai
 Many Brahmin leaders are also established in BJP
 kya ye sabhi upi main brahman vot nahin laa sakate
 i do not understand many times on what basis we see someone's caste bigger than politics
 agar chunaav or jati ke aadhaar par hi ye saansad banaae gaye hai to do saal baad hue is pehle vistaar se yahi lagata he ki modi hi nahin bhartiya raajnneeti ke paas koi nayaa idia nahin he
 There was a lot of discussion about the picture of two mps coming to Parliament by bicycle
 bina shaq ye saraahneey kaary he
 But before making him the representative face of the environment, at least it would be seen what the environmental policies of the government are
 unke kya asar hone vaale hai
 The bicycle is the final representative, so what is the policy? vaise meghavaal shreshth saansad chune gaye hai or prashasnic anubhav bhi he unke paas
 But when all the Dalit mps like him do not come up during the time of Dalit issues, how do they become representatives of all the Dalits from UP to India as soon as they become ministers
 he jaankaron, is lihaaz se to pradhanmantri ko ye karnaa chahie ki sabhi pramukh jatiyon ke sharma, patel, singh, sinha ko mantri banaakar so janaa chahie
 Not that i would have discussed anything differently
 main bhi hota to shaayad yahi sab baaten kar rahaa hota
 It is perhaps because of this that India's politics and its analysts have taken root
 unke paas koi nayaa paimaana nahin he
 Everything in our politics has been decided before we were born
 ham sab use paalane posane ke liye duniya main aae hai! har ankar duusare jaankaar ko sahi kah rahaa he ki aap upi ko dusron se acha jaanate hai
 You know Modi best
 nayaa kya bataa rahe ho jaankaron jo aap saare logon se behatar jaanate hai
 Tell Me No! Comments agar raajnneeti sirf chhavi or projection kaa khel he to janata ko dinabhar tivi hi dekhnaa chahie
 He should keep writing in the passbook the names of ministers of his caste instead of jobs, promotions and cheap studies and cheap hospitals
 pehle se jo mantri bane hai wo bhi umr, jati or anubhav kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 They were also told in this way
 un paimaanon par unka pradarshan kya rahaa he? koi bataa saktaa he? agar assam haar jate to kya pradhanmantri or shah istifa dete? kya ye pehle se hi majboot nahin hai? agar haar jeet inaki majbooti kaa paimaana he to upi haarane ke baad shah kya gujarat bhej diye jaayenge? The same thing happens at the center as well as in the states
 isse janata kaa kya bhala ho rahaa he
 Do these faces also represent any policy? Do they have any thoughts of their own? Do they all have the ability to win elections on their own? Today, all the ministers of UP are being told the face of caste and region, some one can lay hands on the heart and ask whether all these would have won the elections in 2014 without Modi wave? Did you hear the names of Krishna Raj, Mahendra Pandey during the elections? Listening for 2-3 days or years? Best wishes to all the new ministers

 When both the Rajasthan Royals and Kolkata Knight Riders clashed against each other, this match proved to be the most exciting match of the IPL this season and it is expected to be interesting again when both teams face each other again on Monday

 The team registered a resounding win over the Delhi Daredevils on Saturday night with match winner Karun Nair scoring a 73-ball 50
 vahiin keker ko haal main pichley match main chennai superkings se 34 ran kii haar jhelni padi
 The strong side for Rajasthan Royals in Monday's match is their in-form batting order
 team lagaataar teen match jeet chuki he or keker kii kharaab ballebaaji ko dekhte hue lagaataar chauthi jeet kii ummid bhi asambhav nahin dikhti
 The Rajasthan batsman is in excellent form but more will be expected from Shane Watson and Sanju Samson, who are making good contributions but have not yet been able to perform aggressively according to their abilities

 Fast bowler James Faulkner is getting good support in the form of Dhawal Kulkarni and Kane Richardson

 Given the form of both the teams, Rajasthan will start as strong contenders in this match, but given the uncertainty of the tournament and format, KKR can bring surprising results

 Popularly known as Ranji, Ranjit Singh ji was born in Nawanagar and became Maharaj here in 1907 as Maharaja Jam Sahib
 unheen ke naam par bharat main gharelu toornament ranjai toffee khelaa jaataa he
 Love Affair Suppressed! According to 'the Sunday Times', Ranjitsinhji had a love affair with the daughter of his teacher at Cambridge University, the matter was suppressed
 ranjai ne july 1896 main england kii ore se austrailia ke khilaaf padaarpan kiya or apni pehali pari main hi 154 ran banaae jo team ke 305 ran ke kul score ke aadhe se bhi adhik ran the

 brestfding shishu ke saath-saath maa kii sehat ke liye bhi phydemand hoti he
 But in the 21st century, breast feeding has reached its lowest level
 dablyuechao ke mutabik, zyaadaatar deshon main shishu ke janm ke shuruaati 6 maheenon main stanpan karaane kii dar 50 fisadi se bhi neeche he
 Health experts say that breastfeeding is an essential part of early nutrition from the time the baby is born to its second birthday because mother's milk is a multifaceted mixture of nutrients and bioactive building factors
 yah ek navjaat shishu ke jivan ke shuruaati 6 maheenon main jaruri hota he
 Health experts also believe that breast milk is a mixture of macronutrients, micronutrients, bioactive components, growth factors, and immunity components
 yah mishran ek jaivik drav padaarth hota he jisase shaareerik or maansik vruddhi main madad milti he
 At the same time, the risk of metabolic disease in the infant is also eliminated

 At the same time, the child's learning ability is less and their performance in school is less than those children who get only breast milk in the first 6 months of birth
 dablyuechao ke aankadon ke mutabik, har saal lagbhag 2 karod se adhik shishuon kaa vajan janm ke samay 2
 Less than 5 kg
 bachapan main in shishuon main saamaanya vikaas main kami, sankramak beemaari, dhimi vruddhi or mrityu hone kaa jokhim adhik hota he
 Infants who are breastfed within 24 hours of birth have a lower mortality rate than babies who are breastfed 24 hours later
 health export kaa kahana he ki stanpan karaane vaali mahilaon ko pratidin vitamin supplements lenaa chahie
 Actually, vitamins are secreted in breast milk

 vishvanathan anand kaa moscow main paanchavin vishwa championships jeetna vaaki sukhad he
 At the end of a nerves-tingling tie-break, he had a tough, rough win over Boris Gelfand (a year older than Anand)
 vaise to ti-brake kii vyavastha 1985 kii vishwa championships se hi he, lekin pehali baar isaki jarurat 1998 main padi thi, jab rus ke anatoli karpov ne apane is bhartiya khilaadi ko haraaya tha
 Anand was called as the Lightning Kid in the '90s
 is baar moscow main litening kid kii baari thi
 When Anand was ready to play professional chess, he was brought up by the chess machines of the Soviet Union, which had been dusting off all opponents for nearly four decades
 purvi europe ke deshon main un dinon pratibhaaen kai baar to chah saal kii umr main hi pahchaan lee jaatin
 They were carved, trained and sent to a circuit that was supported by the legacy of their mother Russia and the army of veteran trainers
 har khilaadi ke peeche do yaa teen 'second' (sahaayakon, prashikshakon, saajhedaaron ke liye shatranj kii shabdaawalee kaa shabd) hote, jo uske bhavi pratidwandvi ke bare main jaankaree hasil karte the
 Anand entered the chess world as a teenager who had nothing but his own game
 ve aisi jid ke saath utre the, jiskaa ki unke jaise vinamr, aakarshak khilaadi main andaaj laga paanaa mushkil hota tha, jab tak ve teble par chess board ke saamne na baith jaaen
 His rivals would then realize that there was a ferocious rival behind this goggles, neatly tied hair, pressed shirt, and pants (anand had once revealed that the rivals' moods and thoughts were only a matter of hearing their breath
 Can be imposed)
 anand-or gelphand-aisi peedi ke khilaadi hai jo computaron ke aagaaj se thik pehle shatranj kii duniya main ai
 He can be the most diverse and flexible world chess champion, having won titles in all disciplines of the game - classical, knockout and tournament
 khitaab jeetne vaale ve pehle asian bhi hai
 At the 2012 World Championships, he did not go with the world winning form
 pichley chah maheenon main unke ielo reating main 26 ankon kii giravat ai thi
 He was not number one and had recently become a father
 in sabake bich unhen ek aise pratidwandvi se muqabla karnaa padaa jo apane jivan kii nitant apratyaashit chaalen chal rahaa tha
 For Anand it was the 'hardest' match of his life
 yahi nahin, sabase rochak kshan to aathven game main saamne aayaa
 Anand suffered a defeat at the hands of Gelfand in the seventh game but wiped out his opponent in 17 moves
 kisi vishwa shatranj championships ke final ke nattejey dene vaala yah sabase chota game tha
 Chess coach Raghunandan Gokhale says, 'anand is a complete chess player
 craimanik agar kool or shant game pasand karte hai to anand kaaphi gudh khel khelte hai
 If Topalov starts playing intricately, Anand adopts a calm attitude
 kai myanon main gelphand bhi ek sampurna khilaadi kahe ja sakate hai, lekin aapane ek galati kii nahin ki anand aapako hajam kar jaaenge
 Anand has maintained a better balance in this final
 ''clasical game main anand ne gelphand kii banaai asahaj sthitiyon se khud ko baahar nikaala
 For the first time in the last 10 years he had found himself so badly surrounded
 antarrashtriya shatranj khilaadi or stanbhakaar devanshu datta kehete hai, 'huanand kaaphi teji se sochane vaale khilaadi hai
 "the tie-break game could have ended but" Gelfand reached a position where he had only two seconds left and made a serious mistake here
 is tarah vishwa khitaab or 25
 The prize money of 5 lakh dollars was decided in just two seconds

 pichley ek arse se afghanistan aatankiyon kii prayogshaala bana hua he
 Not one, but many terrorist organizations are working here
 jo apane-apane dabadabe ko kaayam rakhane ke liye naa sirf bam barood se dehshat failaa rahe hai balki maanav bam bhi taiyaar kar rahe hai
 For this, terrorist organizations set up training centers
 jahaan isaki training hoti he
 The Taliban have also built many such terror factories in Afghanistan
 taliban jehadi banane kii factory chalaata he
 Where the terror factory moves and suicide bombers are formed
 taliban ke napak aatanki mansoobon ko anjaam dete hai, uske jehadi ladaake
 Which are the biggest forces of Taliban
 ye jehadi ladaake apane aakaa kefarmaan par kuch bhi kar sakate hai
 If you can die, you can die
 ji haa, ye hote hai jehadi
 But the biggest question is how the hatred of these jihadis is so filled with hatred
 aakhir kis tarah inhe marane-maarane ke liye taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 We will tell you the full truth of the Jihadis training
 jehadi lete hai maut kii trainingin ladaakon ko chaar hisso main aatank kaa paath padhaayaa jaataa he
 Jihadis or terrorists are trained in four parts
 ye chaaron charan behad khatarnaak hoten hai
 First lesson - Al Radjiski's duration is three months
 is dauraan solah se ikkis saal kii umr ke rangaruton ko shaareerik or maansik taur par taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Meanwhile, fighters are not allowed to marry
 is training ke liye ye bhi jaruri he ki chune gayi ladaakon ko kisi bhi tarah kii beemaari naa ho
 They know how to read and write and they should be fully prepared for Jihad
 doosraa sabak- gorilla prashikshanye training chah maheene lambii hoti he
 During this time, fighters dedicated to Jihad are taught to operate weapons
 is training se pehle sabhi ladaakon ko apane haathon se vasietnama taiyaar kar apane commander ko dena hota he
 In which they commit their lives in the name of Jihad
 teesraa sabak- jindlaaye training teen maheene tak chalati he
 In this, terrorists are specially trained to make bombs
 training ke isi hisse main aatankiyon ko baari hathiyaar chalaane kaa prashikshan bhi diya jaataa he
 They are trained to make many types of deadly small and big bombs
 chauthaa sabak- doshkaye prashikshan ek hafte se lekar das din tak chalata he
 During this time, fighters are given special training to operate small hand weapons, such as pistols and knives
 unhen kai tarah ke gupt or chote hathiyaaron ko chalaane main maharaat di jaati he
 By the way, jihadi training is completed only after learning all these four lessons
 is training ke dauraan hi aatankiyon ke dilo-dimag main majahab ke naam par nafrat paidaa karne kaa ganda khel bhi chalata rahata hai
 Which affects the Crusaders the most
 iske baad jehadi kisi kobhi maarane ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai
 But the real training still remains
 aise banaae jate hai maanav bamdarasal, in aatankiyon ko kisi bhi vakt jaan dene ke liye taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 And they become human bombs
 ji haa maanav bam, jihadiyon kaa sabase khatarnaak hathiyaar
 In which they themselves die, along with them they keep many lives silent with them forever
 is training ke liye baqayda khaas class lagaai jaati he
 In which special emphasis is given on how and in what condition the human bomb is to be made
 in sari training ke baad ab sabhi ladaake jehadi ban jate hai ore shuru ho jaataa he duniyabar main aatank failaane kaa kaarobaar

 The no-confidence motion against the ruling Modi government at the Center will be discussed and voted today
 modi sarkaar ke sava chaar saal main pehali baar vipaksh avishvaas prastaav laayaa he
 The government has a higher number than the majority figure, so it is confident that this proposal will not succeed
 vaise desh ke sansad ke itihaas main ab tak kareeb 26 baar avishvaas prastaav aae hai lekin do baar hi vipaksh ko isamen safalataa mili he
 The no-confidence motion came against Nehru for the first time The motion of no-confidence in the Indian Parliament came against the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1963
 nehru ke khilaaf jebi kriplani ne avishvaas prastaav rakhaa tha
 JB Kripalani left the party and started the Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party, which later changed to the Praja Socialist Party in association with the Socialist Party, due to the Congress not being re-elected president
 praja socialist party ke tatkaaleen saansad jebi kriplani dwaara nehru sarkaar ke khilaaf laae gaye avishvaas prastaav ke paksh main 62 vot or virodh main 347 vot pade
 In this way, the motion of no confidence collapsed
 shastri ko teen par karnaa padaa saamananehru ke nidhan ke baad desh ke pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri bane
 During his three-year tenure, no confidence motion was brought by the opposition thrice, but not even once did the opposition succeed
 iske baad satta kii kaman indira gandhi ko mili
 Indira Gandhi completed Shastri's remaining term
 is dauraan unke khilaaf do baar prastaav laayaa gaya
 The most no-confidence motion against Indira has been faced by the Congress government led by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, the most no-confidence motion in Indian parliamentary history
 indira gandhi ke khilaaf vipaksh 15 baar avishvaas prastaav laayaa, par ek bhi baar use kamyaabi nahin mili
 The record of presenting the highest no-confidence motion from the opposition is in the name of Jyoti Basu, a member of the Communist Party of india-marxist
 unhone apane chaaron prastaav indira gandhi kii sarkaar ke khilaaf rakhe the
 The government fell for the first time from the no-confidence motion The first time the opposition's no-confidence motion was successful in 1978 in the parliamentary history of India

 pehle prastaav se unhen koi pareshaani nahin hui, lekin 1978 main duusari baar laae gaye avishvaas prastaav main unki sarkaar ke ghatak dalon main aapasi matbhed the
 As soon as his defeat was realized, Morarji Desai resigned before the division of votes
 narsimha raav ko teen baar karnaa padaa saamanalaal bahadur shastri kii tarah narsimha raav kii sarkaar ko bhi teen baar avishvaas prastaav kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In 1993, Narasimha Rao was able to beat the no-confidence motion against his government
 narsimha sarkaar ke khilaaf aae avishvaas prastaav ke voting main 14 vot ke antar se sarkaar bachi
 However, he was also accused of luring the mps of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha to save his government

 When Vajpayee became Prime Minister himself, he too faced a no-confidence motion twice
 inamen se pehali baar to wo sarkaar nahin bachaa paae lekin duusari baar vipaksh ko unhone maat de di
 In 1999, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government faced a no-confidence motion by withdrawing the support of Jayalalithaa's party
 tab vaajapeyi sarkaar 1 vot ke andar se haar gai thi
 He had already resigned before voting
 iske baad 2003 main vaajapeyi ke khilaaf laae avishvaas prastaav ko endie ne aaraam se vipaksh ko voton kii ginati main haraa diya tha
 The NDA got 312 votes while the opposition was reduced to 186 votes

 The existence of North Korea as an invincible power can neither be weakened nor denied

 The date was stuck between 25 and 29

 Looked a little bit
 bahut kuch dekhnaa rah gaya
 All of you are seen as seen
 
 
 jaipper litarechar festival - aisa vahaan ke theth sthaneey kehete hai
 For the rest of the public, it is the Jaipur Literature Festival
 dilli, chandigarh or aasapaas ke shaharon kii sambhraant janata ke liye weekend geouve
 The public who used to go anywhere from Volvo and uber-ola
 public transport kaa haal dekhakar naak-bhun sikodti or aise jalson main saamaajik nyaay or streevad kaa naaraa buland karti
 Before going anywhere, he used to search the hotel in hifi
 to is baar ham bhi ho aae
 26 January - We were also in weekend mode after playing the job on Republic Day
 wo kya he na ki mahanagaron main naukari karne vaali janata ke liye weekend next level kii cheez he
 They work for 5 days only so that they can have a two-day weekend
 fursatah nautanki kii adbhut gadhy gaathajaipur jane se pehle vahaan se rapat karne gai ek dost se poocha ki vahaan kaise hai seshan? jawaab tha thik hai
 We said - keep thinking
 usne kaha- chale aao
 Otherwise we had a 4-day long holiday, adding weekends and compoffs
 ghar jane vaale the, lekin thanks tu indian railway
 We were about to leave and reached Bihar and Rajasthan
 khayr, ham dilli se 296 rupee kiraaye lagaakar subah-subah jaipur pahunch gaye
 Sindhi Camp Bus Stand
 vahaan se ola bike ride se dost ke ghar pahunch gaye
 It was a little far away
 shahar ke duusare hisse main
 Dost is also a reporter for the state's leading newspaper
 use bhi vahaan aana tha
 So after bathing and washing her house, she came away with Scooty
 uske kahe anusaar lit fest kii raunak har baar chhijati ja rahi
 We said that man we have never seen before
 jahaan 2 saal se kaam bhi karte hai
 The water there was covered from the desk
 naukari cheez hi aisi he
 The man becomes a wanderer
 jate-jate beete roj ke shahari akhbaar par ek najar maar lee thi
 Some read and some missed
 jab vahaan pahunche tab tak anuraag kashyap hindi heart land (hindi pattee) ke mashhoor krime thriller lekhak surendra mohan pathak ke nowell 'na bairi na koi begaana' ko launch kar chuke the
 Anurag Kashyap is everywhere nowadays
 hamaari soshal media feed se lekar tamaam jalson main
 It may be due to his recent release of the film, but it is so
 jab ham jalse main pahunche tab tak suraj apane charam par tha
 Jaipur is not as cold as Delhi
 dhoop bhi chatkh
 Place of prom Diggy Palace jalse ke sthal par pahunchakar paaya ki vahaan ke sabase bade manch 'charbagh' main shashi tharur kisi masale par panel discshan main shaamil hai
 The number of public seats was frozen
 lagbhag utani hi janata pandal se baahar ke ilaake se uchak-uchakkar kuch sunne or dekhne ke prayaas main lagi hui
 Since the sun was at its peak and the rest of the work was done by the people there
 deh se deh ragadati janata
 The public blown off their feet
 anwar jalalpuri: vah jo ek vaada thathodi der tak sunne ke prayaas main fail hone ke baad ham kitabon ke haul main daakhil hue
 Entering the hall, they were very warm to see what all is, but here the matter was different
 chaaron taraf angreji kii kitaaben or wo bhi adhikansh unheen lekhakon kii jinaki kitaaben jalse main launch huin yaa hone vaali hai
 In a short time, sweat started on the back of the ear and on the forehead
 chunachunni hone lagi so alag
 Wanted to run away from there quickly, then Surendra Mohan Pathak's book was seen among all the English books
 ham bhi thithke
 Surendra Mohan Pathak's books also hold readers with something similar
 magar yahaan maamla jaraa juda tha
 Here his book did not look like the railway platform, outside the railway station with Mastram's porn books
 raf copy vaale kaagaj par chhapi hui
 Rather, competing with the books of Penguin and Juggernaut
 kaagaj kii quality bhi ekadam jhakkaas
 Mind thought that the books of Surendra Mohan Pathak have been read most in this country
 usee lekhak kii hindi main likhi gai kitaab angreji kii kitabon ke bich kaise bechaari si padi he
 Just as politics may have become the language to rule, but English is acceptable among bureaucracy and elite people
 jaise razia gundon main funs jaati he

 film kaa naam:patel kii punjabi shadidiarector:sanjay chelastar cast:rishi kapur, paresh rawal ,prem chopra, vir das , paayal gholvadhi:2 ghantasrtificate:u / aretimga:2 stararishi kapur or paresh rawal kii kamedi film 'patel kii punjabi shaadi:lado magar pyaar se' relies ho gai he
 Based on Shaadi Entertainment, the film marks the return of Paresh Rawal and Rishi Kapoor to the big screen
 'patel kii punjabi shaadi:lado magar pyaar se'film ke naam se hi ye saaf he ki ye film ek patel or ek punjabi parivaar ke bich pyaar or takaraar kii kahani he
 The director of this film, Sanjay Chail, has come back with this film after a long time
 iske pehle diarector ke taur par unhone khubasurat or maan gaye mughal-e-ajam jaisi filmein diarect kar chuke hai
 Let's know his recent release 'patel's Punjabi Shaadi' is a film
 
 
 bhaabi ji ghar par hai se nikaali gai thim shilpa scindia, is item number se vaapasikahanefilm main hansmukh patel (paresh rawal) apni maa, badi beti or choti beti puja patel (paayal ghosh) ke saath mumbai kii ek gujarati sosayadi main rahata he
 After the death of Hansmukh's wife, he keeps the daughters alone and binds them to many rules and laws
 yahaan tak ki vah sosayadi waalon ko bhi apni gujarati samskruti kii raksha ke liye uksaata rahata he, yahaan tak kii sosayadi main gujaratiyon ke alaava hasmukh ko kisi kaa aana katai pasand nahin
 The twist in the story comes when a bungalow in front of his house is bought by a second-hand dealer, Guggi Tandon (rishi Kapoor) with his wife, father Prem Tandon (prem Chopra) and son Monty (veer Das)
 ek taraf hansmukh kaa samskruti se bharaa hua parivaar he to vahiin duusari taraf guggi kii family puri tarah se bindaas or khule swabhaav kii he
 Cheerful tells her daughter to stay away from them, but Monty and Pooja fall in love at first sight, meanwhile something happens in the Tandon family during Pooja's elder sister's engagement that the engagement breaks down Because of which the cheerful becomes even more angry
 iske baad guggi or monti apni galati ko sudhaarney main lag jate hai, ab kya monti or puja kaa pyaar shaadi main tabdeel ho paata he, iskaa pataa aapako film dekhakar hi chalegaa
 After watching the trailer of the weak Qadian film, it seemed that the film would be alright but the story of the entire film is quite moving and a lot of work should have been done at the script level
 film kii casting bahut badhiya he lekin screenple kii maar kii vajah se film kamjor dikhaai detii he
 The storyline between Gujarati and Punjabi families could have been excellent
 film kaa sangeet bhi relies se pehle hit nahin ho paaya he jise durust kiya ja saktaa tha
 Know why to watch this film: The film's direction is good as well as Rishi Kapoor's payment is very good, Rishi Kapoor himself is also a Punjabi and it is very fun to see him in Guggi's character

 kya aapako bhi aisa lagata he ki ek ore jahaan aap is relationships ko ek kadam or aage le jane ke bare main soch rahe hai vahiin aapkaa partner is maamle ko lekar bilkul shant he?kya aapako bhi aisa mahasoos hota he aapaki tulana main aapkaa partner is rishte ko lekar kaaphi laaparvaah he? agar haa to, ye aapke liye chintaa kii baat he
 But this thing is not even 100 percent true, because often boys take time in such cases
 ho saktaa he kiek ore jahaan aap is rishte ko aage lekar janaa chaahate hon vahiin aapkaa partner is rishte ko us nazariye se nahin dekhtaa ho
 If you also doubt your partner's intention or if you do not understand his behavior, then you can guess the thing going on in his mind with these four symptoms
 1
 Apart from both of you, no third is aware that both of you are dating each other
if the relationship between you is really serious, then your partner will definitely introduce you to your family and friends
 par agar usne abhi tak aisa nahin kiya he to ho na ho kuch gadabad to jarur he
 If he still introduces you to people only by saying he is a friend, then it is important for you to become aware
 2
 Does your partner also get lost somewhere during the stay and then comes back on his own
 Whenever you plan to go somewhere, does your partner also start counting you due to not being involved in it? Does he not reply to you even after several messages? Yafir he answers your phone call only after one or two days? If yes, this condition is not true in any way
 kya aapke saath aisa bhi hota he ki aapkaa partner ekaek aapke prati bahut bhavuk ho jaataa he or kisi din achaanak se hi aapako bin bataae gaayab ho jaataa he? agar aapke rishte main bhi aisa kuch chal rahaa he to yah aapke liye sanbhal jane kaa samay he
 3
 kya aapke partner ko aapse kisi saarvajanik jagah par milane main hichkichaahat hoti hekya aapkaa partner aapse ghar par milane ke liye to turant raji ho jaataa he par jab aap use kisi hotel yaa saarvajanik jagah par bulaati hai to wo naaraaz ho jaataa he?agar haa, to ab ye samajhane main der nahin karen ki vah is rishte ko gambhirtha se nahin dekhtaa he
 4
 bhavishya kii yojanaon par baat karne main kataranajab do log sachche dil se kisi rishte main bandhe hote hai or use aage lekar jane kii baat sochate hai to unke paas bhavishya kii yojanaon ko lekar kai tarah kii baaten or vichaar hote hai
 But if your partner is not even interested in talking to you about future plans, then understand that it is good for you to break away from him

 If the proposal of the Ministry of Labor is accepted, there will be a sharp increase in the number of jobs in the country
 2019 ke chunaav se pehle sarkaar is morche par aankade gulabi kar yuva matadaataaon ko prabhavit karne kii koshish kar sakati he
 Recently, in an interview to a TV channel, PM Modi said that if someone is selling pakoda and taking 200 rupees a day, then that too is an employment
 jise aankadon main shaamil nahin kiya jaataa
 However, this statement of PM Modi was targeted by social media users to opposition parties
 iconomic times kii khabar ke anusaar, shram mantralay pradhanmantri mudra yojana (PMMY) ke tahat rojgaar hasil karne vaale logon ko bhi naukari hasil karne vaale logon ke record main shaamil karne kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 Senior ministers of the government, who are being criticized on the employment front, have been consistently saying that a large number of youth have got loans and employment under PMMY, so why not include it in the job statistics
 khud piem modi ek tivi channel ko die gaye intervyuu main pakora bechney vaale ke udhaaharan ke saath anaupchaarik kshetra main milane vaale rojgaar kaa ullekh kar chuke hai
 a recently released government data had said that 55 lakh people will join the EPFO network in this financial year, which proves that there is a good growth in jobs
 lekin aalochakon kaa kahana he ki ipiefo namakan badhane kaa matlab yah nahin he ki naukariyaan bhi bad rahi hai
 Apart from this, the representatives of the government say that the number of crores of loans given under the Pradhan mantrimudra Yojana has also provided employment to a large number of people
 in swarozgaar main lage logon ko bhi naukariyon ke aankadon se jodna hoga
 India has a workforce of over 50 crore and if people associated with PMMY are added to it then the number of 5 crore people will increase
 is workforce kaa kareeb 10 fisadi hissaa hi aupchaarik kshetra main he
 The Labor Bureau under the Ministry of Labor will soon analyze the data on the beneficiaries of PMMY
 is tarah kaa lone swarozgaar ke liye yuvaaon yaa chote udhyamiyon ko diya jaataa he
 Significantly, after coming to power in 2014, PM Modi had set a target of generating 1 crore jobs every year
 lekin pichley chaar saal main vastav main rojgaar kaa srijan mahaj kuch lakh kaa hi ho sakaa
 Just 4 in FY 2017, according to Labor Bureau data

 ' is sankshipt mulaakaat ke turant baad hi saraswati nadi par baat shuru ho gai
 My eyes were on the farm where small mounds of mud were formed after digging
 koi board dhund rahaa tha, jis par likhaa ho ki yahaan saraswati nadi kii khoj ke liye khudaai kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 In the hope that the team of archaeologists will be seen moving, who will have some tools in their hands and a cap on the head
 aisa kuch nahin dikhaa
 For once i felt where we have come
 choti nahar jitani chaudaai or mere dub jane jinati gaharaai tak khudaai nazar ai
 Professor Chaudhary informed that such excavation is going on in more than forty villages
 sarkaar ne 50 karod kaa bajet diya he or manaregaa ke tahat yah kaam karaayaa ja rahaa he
 a closed river is being sought in our psyche and history under the same MNREGA, which is said to be closed
 sunate hi mere kaanon main gudagudi si ho gai
 It was heard for the first time, so it was the first time the ears tickled
 nishchit rup se puratathvik yaa bhugarbheey utkhanan is tarah se nahin hota hoga ki rojgaar guarantee vaale khod kar chale jaaen or baad main bhugarbhashastri aakar sample le jaaen
 There will be some rules regarding the receipt of goods and recording every stage and level of excavation
 pichley do sau saal ke likhit itihaas main saraswati ke hone yaa na hone ko lekar bahes chal rahi he
 There have been claims of Saraswati meeting in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh
 rugveda se lekar puranic kathaon main saraswati to he magar zamin par kahaan bahati rahi hogi iskaa sahi sahi daawa nahin ho paaya he
 There is also a debate on whether Saraswati was a giant river or a small river
 is desh main jahaan ek nadi ke ek hi ilaake main bees naam hote hai usee desh main saraswati naam kii kai nadiyaan pai jaati rahi hai
 Not only this, the name Saraswati also has many meanings
 iskaa koi hisaab karne vaala nahin he ki jis saraswati ko dhundne main hamane dau sau saal laga die usee dauraan kitni hi nadiyaan vilupt ho gayi or suukh gayi
 Saraswati has been discovered in books and papers
 kabhi vigyaan banaam puraana ho jaataa he to vam banaam sangh
 In the controversy over the papers, Saraswati's supporters sometimes take her to the run of Kutch and sometimes to the confluence of Allahabad
 kabhi wo himalay se utarati chali aati he to kabhi barsaati nadi banakar kisi or nadi main milte hue pakistan chali jaati he
 It is also a fact that Saraswati also changes as the government changes in Delhi
 wo nahin hone se ho jaati he or hone se nahin ho jaati he
 So, i am not commenting on the proof of its existence
 haryana ke mughalawali gaanv kii jis zamin par saraswati ke milane ke daawey kiye ja rahe hai, uski baat kar rahaa hum
 The sarpanches are digging under the MNREGA and together with the evidence of the founding of a river as a bonus
 yah sab ek vibhaag or ek sarkaar kaa daawa he
 At such a depth from the surface, there is no evidence that the river can be found or can not be found
 lekin jo ilaaka nadiyon se bharaa ho vahaan kam khudaai par pani milanaa kya achraj
 Is this Saraswati river? professor choudhary kaa jawaab bahut rochak laga
 He said that there is no Saraswati river, the answer is that it is Saraswati river
 mujhe professor choudhary ke bhugarbheey daavon par yakeen to nahin hua lekin simit yogyata ke kaaran sahaj buddhi se hi sawaal karata rahaa or ve mujhe pramanik taur par bataate rahe
 Now only a geologist can confirm his point
 kudaal se hui khudaai se jo diwaar bani he uske neeche nadi kii dhara ke pramaan dikhaate hue professor choudhary ne kaha ki isaki disha haryana ke dakshin se gujarat ke kuccha yani pashchim kii taraf he
 He also showed a thin plate of rock particles under the stream that shows that the river flowed here
 in kanon kii umr kya he iskaa moolyankan hona baaki he
 After my recording, Professor Chaudhary's team started taking samples

 Professor Chaudhary informed that such excavation is going on in more than forty villages
 sarkaar ne 50 karod kaa bajet diya he or manaregaa ke tahat yah kaam karaayaa ja rahaa he
 a closed river is being sought in our psyche and history under the same MNREGA, which is said to be closed

 The government and a department will soon clear the trail, which the world would like to see as the path of Saraswati
 kya isi tarah ham vaigyanik soch kaa prasar karnaa chaahate hai
 What could be a bigger tragedy than being a Saraswati
 saraswati kitabon or qaagazon main khoji ja chuki he
 Sometimes science becomes mythology then Left vs
 Union
 kaagazon par jo vivaad he usamen saraswati ke samarthak kabhi use kuccha ke ran kii taraf baha le jate hai to kabhi elahabaad ke sangam kii taraf
 Sometimes she comes descending from the Himalayas, sometimes becomes a rainy river and goes to Pakistan joining another river
 yah bhi ek tathy he ki dilli main sarkaar badalte hi saraswati bhi badal jaati he
 It happens by not being and not by being
 isliye iske hone ke pramaan par main tippanee nahin kar rahaa hum
 i am talking about the land of Mughalwali village in Haryana on which Saraswati claims to meet
 sarpanch manaregaa ke tahat khudaai kar rahe hai or saath main bonus ke taur par ek nadi ke milane kaa pramaan bhi mil rahaa he
 All this is a claim of a department and a government
 sataha se itani kam gaharaai par nadi hone kaa pramaan mil hi saktaa he yaa nahin mil saktaa he, yah daawa to nahin kar saktaa
 But what is surprising to find water on less excavation in the area which is full of rivers
 kya ye saraswati nadi he
 Professor Chaudhary's answer was very interesting
 unhone kaha ki saraswati nadi nahin he kaa yahi jawaab he ki yah saraswati nadi he
 i did not believe Professor Chaudhary's geological claims, but due to limited ability, he kept questioning with an intuitive intelligence and he kept telling me authentically
 ab unki baat kii tasdik koi bhugarbha shastri hi kar saktaa he
 Showing the evidence of the stream of the river below the wall built by the excavation from the hoe, Professor Chaudhary said that its direction is from south of Haryana towards Kutch i
e
 west of Gujarat
 unhone dhara ke nishaan ke neeche chattaanon ke kan kii ek patali peti bhi dikhaai ki isse pataa chalata he ki yahaan nadi bahati thi
 The age of these particles remains to be evaluated
 meri ricarding hone ke baad professor choudhary kii team sample lene lagi
 The direction has been given from these streams of sand, but what will be the age of the stream which is only six feet below, is also a matter of investigation
 shaayad
 Now, if there is no confluence Saraswati, then the Allahabad existence of Ganga Jamuna Saraswati, recorded in folklore, beliefs and mythological literature, is either rejected or is under question
 yani ab sab kuch bhugarbheey pramaan se sabit hona he
 Professor Chaudhary is giving proof of the existence of Saraswati on the basis of direction but not claiming that it is Saraswati
 das foot neeche kii sataha par mili pani ko dikhaa rahe hai ki yah nadi ke hone kaa pramaan he
 How would it be known that the water is of Saraswati? It got different answers and every answer gave way to a question
 ham kaise maan len yamunagar se haryana ke pashchim kii taraf se saraswati hi bahati hogi, koi or nadi nahin
 a river originated from the Aravalli in Delhi and met the Yamuna via Khan Market
 hamaare desh main nadiyon kaa rasta sirf himalay se nahin nilakata he
 It will happen when proved, but if it is Saraswati then it is a matter of national importance
 is site kaa vishesh taur par sangrakshan to hona hi chahie
 Professor Chaudhary told that less than one kilometer from the excavation site there is a Som river, whose water will be brought into this canal so that people feel that it is Saraswati
 lekin kya isse saraswati kii dhara ke aitihaasik pramaan nasht nahin ho jaaenge, to jawaab mila ki isse paryaton kaa vikaas hoga
 Employment will increase
 hazaron saal puraani nadi jis jagah mili ho kya koi bhi shikshit samaaj aisa karegaa ki usamen kisi or nadi kaa pani bhar de
 The comments kam se kam main yojana ke is paksh par sawaal to kar hi saktaa hum
 Are our tourists so naive that mixing the water of a rainy river in a nearby dug canal would make them understand Saraswati
 phir ham saraswati kaa talash hi kyon kar rahe the, un nadiyon ko bhi to saraswati maan sakate the jinhen ab bhi saraswati pukaara jaataa he
 If everything is for tourism and marketing, then we can also move the river in shopping bags in plastic bags
 aajkal har maal ke baahar plastic kaa ek talab banaaya jaataa he jisamen bachche car kii aakaar vaali naaven chalaate hai
 Professor Chaudhary said that Som river and Saraswati are tributaries
 som nadi saraswati kii poorak bhi ho sakati he
 i did not see any river coming from the same direction and running so close together
 jabaki donon kii duuri ek kimi bhi nahin he
 Shouldn't it be proved that water is not found there due to the edge of Som where it is being connected to the direction of Saraswati after meeting
 kya yah nahin ho saktaa ki yah som nadi kaa hi ilaaka ho
 All this will be revealed when there is extensive research but it seems that everything is happening in a hurry
 sarkaar or ek vibhaag daawa kar jaldi hi us nishaan ko hameshaa ke liye mitaa denge, jise duniya saraswati ke maarg ke rup main dekhnaa chaahegi
 Is this how we want to spread scientific thinking
 saraswati hone kii isse badi traasadee kya ho sakati he
 So, i am not commenting on the proof of its existence
 haryana ke mughalawali gaanv kii jis zamin par saraswati ke milane ke daawey kiye ja rahe hai, uski baat kar rahaa hum
 The sarpanches are digging under the MNREGA and together with the evidence of the founding of a river as a bonus
 yah sab ek vibhaag or ek sarkaar kaa daawa he
 At such a depth from the surface, there is no evidence that the river can be found or can not be found
 lekin jo ilaaka nadiyon se bharaa ho vahaan kam khudaai par pani milanaa kya achraj
 Is this Saraswati river? professor choudhary kaa jawaab bahut rochak laga
 He said that there is no Saraswati river, the answer is that it is Saraswati river
 mujhe professor choudhary ke bhugarbheey daavon par yakeen to nahin hua lekin simit yogyata ke kaaran sahaj buddhi se hi sawaal karata rahaa or ve mujhe pramanik taur par bataate rahe

 Can it not be that it is the area of the river Som? yah sab to tab saamne aayega jab vyapak shodh honge lekin aisa lagata he ki sab kuch jaldi main ho rahaa he
 The government and a department will soon clear the trail, which the world would like to see as the path of Saraswati
 kya isi tarah ham vaigyanik soch kaa prasar karnaa chaahate hai
 What could be a bigger tragedy than being a Saraswati
 kam se kam main yojana ke is paksh par sawaal to kar hi saktaa hum
 Are our tourists so naive that mixing the water of a rainy river in a nearby dug canal would make them understand Saraswati
 phir ham saraswati kaa talash hi kyon kar rahe the, un nadiyon ko bhi to saraswati maan sakate the jinhen ab bhi saraswati pukaara jaataa he
 If everything is for tourism and marketing, then we can also move the river in shopping bags in plastic bags
 aajkal har maal ke baahar plastic kaa ek talab banaaya jaataa he jisamen bachche car kii aakaar vaali naaven chalaate hai
 Professor Chaudhary said that Som river and Saraswati are tributaries
 som nadi saraswati kii poorak bhi ho sakati he
 i did not see any river coming from the same direction and running so close together
 jabaki donon kii duuri ek kimi bhi nahin he
 Shouldn't it be proved that water is not found there due to the edge of Som where it is being connected to the direction of Saraswati after meeting
 kya yah nahin ho saktaa ki yah som nadi kaa hi ilaaka ho
 All this will be revealed when there is extensive research but it seems that everything is happening in a hurry
 sarkaar or ek vibhaag daawa kar jaldi hi us nishaan ko hameshaa ke liye mitaa denge, jise duniya saraswati ke maarg ke rup main dekhnaa chaahegi
 Is this how we want to spread scientific thinking
 saraswati hone kii isse badi traasadee kya ho sakati he

 Amit Shah- 70,000 crore corrupt leaders of irrigation scheme ate up Amit shah-aap formed 'double-decker government' In view of Assembly elections in Maharashtra, BJP National President and Home Minister Amit Shah addressed the rally in Kolhapur today
 is dauraan unhone kaha ki bharat or maharashtra ne piem modi ko loksabhaa main 300 se zyada site deen or unhone sansad ke pehle satr main hi 370 hataakar kashmir ko bharat kii mukhyadhara se jod liya
 He further said that there are 2 options before the people of Maharashtra, on one side the BJP and Shiv Sena are standing under the leadership of Modi ji, Devendra Fadnavis and Uddhav Thackeray, on the other side there are Rahul Baba and Sharad Pawar
 in donon ke bich main maharashtra kii janata ko nirnay lenaa he
 Amit Shah said, "PM Modi conducted an air strike, destroyed the terrorist hideouts of Balakot and killed the Pakistani terrorists
 lekin rahul gandhi kehete hai ki aap chola odh kar khun kii dallali karte hai
 "amit Shah also targeted the Congress and NCP over the issue of farmers
 unhone kaha, "jab congress or ensipi satta main thi unhone 70,000 karod kii ek sinchai skim kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Not a single farmer got water
 sara paisa bhrasht netaaon ne kha liya tha
 "amit Shah said at the rally that you have formed a 'double-decker government', with PM Modi on top and Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra

 agar aap kisi ke saath pehali baar date par ja rahe hai, to yaad rakhie ki aapke bare main impresssont shuruaati chand palon main hi bana liya jaataa he
 a research has found that you only have 12 minutes to make a good impression on a date
 eexe ne do hajaar logon se unke pehle date ke anubhavon ke bare main sawaal kiya
 According to research, opinions are made about you based on your smile, eye contact and voice
 yah bhi khulaasa hua ki agar in teenon ke aadhaar par koi janchataa bhi he, to uske sharir kii durgandh or munh kii badboo kii vajah se use dich kar diya jaataa he
 Apart from this, if you start eating on the matter, be careful
 aapaki yah harakat aapaki chhavi ke liye khatarnaak sabit ho sakati he
 Judgment starts before the meeting
 Many people look at the person's social media activity before going on a date
 zyaadaatar fasebuk profile or twitor post ke aadhaar par log apni date ke nechar or kairactor ke bare memray kaayam kar lete hai
 Before going on a date, people do make-up overshodding
 It has also come to the conclusion that before going on a particular date, people have a lot of effort in grooming their appearance
 iske liye nae heirkat, naeparfum or mainicyor ko adhiktar mahilaayein tarjeeh detii hai
 On the other hand, most men make impressions using a stylish beard
 kareeb chah fisadi mahilaayein or paanch fisadi purush kisi ke saath pehali date par jane se pehle diet bhi karte hai
 Purusha is the first to give a second chance
 Sometimes it happens that the first meeting with someone is very bad
 phir bhi mahilaon kii apeksha zyaadaatar purush apni date se duusari mulaakaat karte hai or use samajhane kii koshish karte hai
 According to psychologist Douna Dawson, even the smallest movement during a date matters a lot
 khud ko badalane kii bajaay aap jaise hai, vaise hi rahen
 Just take care of courtesy
 bhale hi aap nervas hon, par agar saamne vaala aapako dekhakar muskuraae, to aapako bhi smil kerani chahie

 upbhog bhartiya arthvyavastha kii tarakkee kaa bada aadhaar he, kyonki jidipi main iskaa sabase bada yogadan hota he, lekin haal ke varshon main iskaa yogadan gata he
 The declining inflation in urban and rural areas indicates that demand is declining in both these areas

 Regarding this decline, the Reserve Bank report said, "the weakness in PFCE is higher than the initial estimate and has led to cuts in both urban and rural areas, indicating that the decline in the economy is widespread

 Similarly, declining car sales, reduced domestic air travel and falling production of TV sets, hand tools, passenger vehicles, two wheels make it clear that consumption in urban areas is declining

 At the level of state governments, this decline is even more

 The Economic Survey for the year 2018-19 states that 'consumption performance is important in determining the growth of the economy

 This trend of steady decline indicates that the war on inflation has been too much

 It said, "rapid food prices will help increase the income and spending capacity of rural areas and then increase rural consumption

 We have to keep nominal GDP growth high, which will increase tax revenue and provide more scope for capital expenditure

 prati vyakti aay banaam prati vyakti khapatyah baat ab chuphi nahin he ki gramin or shahari, donon ilaakon main logon kii aay ghat rahi he
 According to a 2019 study by the State Bank of India (SBI) on the root cause of the current decrease in demand, urban and rural wages have fallen drastically and this is the 'most important' reason for economic slowdown
 study ke mutabik kuch saal pehle shahari or gramin donon ilaakon main logon ke vetan-mazdooree (veg) main do ankon main badhat ho rahi thi
 In urban areas, the increase in pay is 20 in the year 2010-11

 According to Professor Srivastava, this may be due to a decline in family savings - which is another sign of declining income and investment

 For generations in the southern part of the US, men were regularly sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes they had never committed
 aisa khaskar tab jarur hota tha agar kisi shwet kii hatya yaa usase balaatkaar jaisi aapraadhik ghatana hui ho
 White prosecutors, white judges, and white members of juries often acknowledged that the evidence was inadequate, even contradictory, but citing a broader sense of justice towards the majority white community from which they came
 Used to defend the decision
 babari masjid ke vivaadit sthal ko lekar bharat ke supreme court kaa faisla hindu bahusankhya bhaawanaaon kii waisi hi vyakhya karata prathit hota he
 The overwhelming evidence associated with eight centuries of use of the disputed territory did not help to come to a clear conclusion, and there are many contradictions in this long story, including the outright violation of the law that led to the controversy
 baharhaal, adaalat ne 'sambhaavnaaon kaa santulan' ke aadhaar par faisla sunaaya ki 'hinduon ke daawey' main musalamaanon kii tulana main adhik vaidhata he
 Throughout the verdict, the judges meticulously mentioned all types of constitutional principles, facts and evidence, but eventually came to the conclusion of which party documented the 'uninterrupted use' of the place
 adaalat ne kaha ki do gaiyrkanoonee kaamon kii vajah se musalamaanon kaa is sthal kaa 'nirbaadh upyog' baadhit hua tha
 First, the installation of statues of Ramlala in the Babri Masjid in 1949 and the demolition of the structure in 1992
 phir bhi, 'nirbaadh upyog' main 70 saal main yah chook ek aise sakshya main badal jaati he jo is sthal par musalamaanon ke daavon ke khilaaf jaataa he
 This important step is like 'blaming the victim'
 iskaa matlab he ki yah faisla nyaayashastra kii kitabon main ek mahaan faisle ke rup main shaayad hi darj ho
 Instead, it is a great example of the court acting in a different interpretation of the sense of justice towards the community that the court is serving
 yah samudaay koun he or kya he?sabase pehle to ek phir se chuni hui bahumat vaali sarkaar or uske samarthakon or kaaryakartaaon kii vishaal sena he jo 1980 ke dashak se hi yah daawa karte hue satta or rajnatik bahumat kii ore badi he ki vivaadit sthal vastav main bhagwaan ram kii janmabhumi he or musalamaanon ne mandir ko dhwast karke uske upar babari masjid kaa nirmaan kiya tha
 He says that this is a question related to faith and it cannot be replaced by any kind of evidence
 masalan, bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan (ees) ne paaya ki babari masjid ke maamle main kisi hindu mandir ko dhwast karke uske upar masjid banane kaa koi saboot nahin mila he
 Secondly, the court refers to a category called 'hindus' throughout the judgment
 yah vaisaa hi he jaise angrejon ne jin sthaneey samoohon ko 1856 main parisar ke bahari praangan kaa upyog karne kii anumati di, or jin logon ne 1949 main masjid main murtiyon sthapit kar deen, or aresas se sambandhit ve sanghathan jo 1980 ke dashak se hi us sthal ke aasapaas mandara rahe hai, ve hi darasal ek vaastavik or aam 'hindu' hit kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, bahumat kii aawaaj bhi ek taraf rakhie
 Anyone who has understood the development of RSS and its organizations will know that they want to be accepted as authentic representatives of Hindus everywhere
 ab bahut-se log aisa maanane lagenge ki is daawey ko kanoonee samarthan hasil ho gaya he
 Ultimately, the court, in its thinking, clearly gave importance to the restoration of 'public peace'
 hajaaron surakshakarmiyon kii tainaati ne sanket diya ki sarkaar kisi tarah kaa jokhim nahin uthaanaa chaahati
 However, in this long dispute, the real threat to public order has never been seen from the members of the minority community
 is maamle main khatre kaa andeshaa un sangathit ugr hindu samoohon se rahaa he, jinhone 1949 main vivaad ko bhadakaayaa, babari masjid ko nasht kar diya or is sthal par ek mandir ke nirmaan ke liye abhiyaan chalaaya
 It is from these groups that there has been a real threat of large-scale violence that has had a very close relationship with this government and the court has accepted the authority of those who claim to represent 'hindus' over the entire disputed area
 faisle kaa bachaav karne vaale yah bataaenge ki jin maamalon main siyaasi daanv bade hote hai, unamem public mood kii vyakhya or rajnatik auchity kaa akalan aprihaary he
 They can also claim that this is a practical and impartial decision, which will resolve the issue of land and eliminate the root cause of all disputes, as well as the comment that in some cases with the Muslim community there is excess Therefore, in the judgment, the government has also been instructed not to provide land to Muslims for the construction of a mosque

 This Supreme Court's interpretation of justice made in 2019 clearly targets the 2010 judgment of the Allahabad High Court, calling it an inadequate system of 'guaranteeing public peace and harmony'

 However, the logic here is to strike a communal balance between the conflicting claims of the two communities
 hycourt ke faisle main vivaadit 2
 The 77-acre area was ordered to be divided into three parts: the central dome, where some people installed the idols in 1949, was given to 'hindus' on the grounds that they considered it the exact place of birth of Lord Rama
 (although this claim is of recent historical origin); The outer courtyard, where various groups of Hindus have worshiped for centuries, will go to the local Nirmohi Akhara; And the rest to the Waqf Board of Uttar Pradesh
 haalanki kuch maamalon main satarkta ke baavjood 2010 ke us faisle ne supreme court ke pichley hafte sunaae gaye faisle kaa maarg prashast kiya
 It believed in a way that 'breaking evidence on the ground' by breaking several laws in 1949 and demolishing a mosque in 1992 could become evidence of authentic religious sentiments after a time that could be considered legitimate

 There are thousands of places all over India, which have been used by both Muslims and Hindus for centuries

 @beingsalmankhan @saqibsaleem @iambobbydeol @jacquelinef143 @remodsouza # race3a post shared by TIPS (@tips) on Nov 9, 2017 at 12:12am PST Yogi Adityanath, who became the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, is the Mahant of the famous Gorakhnath temple in Gorakhpur
 is mandir parisar main sthit gaushala main gujarat or haryana se laai gayi takreeban 350 gaay hai
 There are 15 caretakers to take care of this gaushala, 14 of which are Hindus and one Muslim
 is muslim yuvak kaa naam hai maan mohammad, jo pichley 10 varshon se is gaushala main kaam kar rahaa he
 In a special conversation with 'aaj Tak', Maan Mohammad said that even though he was Muslim, he never faced discrimination in this gaushala of Yogi Adityanath
 maan mohammad kaa kahana he ki raajnneetik virodhiyon ne yogi adityanath kii chhavi kharaab karne ke liye unhen kattar hindu netaa bana diya he
 a person named Mohammad Yasin Ansari has also been serving in the Gorakhnath temple for the last 40 years
 yaccin ansaari jisaki umr ab 62 saal he, vah 22 saal kii umr main hi gorakhnath mandir aayaa tha or 1977 se lekar 1983 tak usne mandir ke kaisier ke rup main kaam kiya or uske baad mandir main hi nirmit ho rahi imaaraton ke suparvizer ke rup main kaam kar rahaa he
 In these 40 years, Yasin Ansari built Sadhana Bhavan, Yatri Niwas, Indus Sevashram, Sanskrit Vidyapeeth, Hospital, Shops and five temples in the temple
 yaccin ansaari kaa kahana he kiyogi adityanathmusalamaanon se nafrat nahin karte hai or agar aisa hota to pichley 40 varshon se mandir parisar main kaam karne ke liye nahin rakhte
 Ansari says that he can go from Yogi Adityanath's room to all the places where Yogi Adityanath goes
 ansaari kaa kahana he ki kai baar unke parivaar main shaadi byaah main bhi yogi adityanath ne shirkat kii he
 a similar story is that of Mustakim and his wife Azizunisha, who run a bangles shop in Gorakhnath temple
 yah donon pichley 35 varshon se mandir parisar main chudiyon kii dukaan chalaa rahe hai or inkaa kahana he ki itane varshon main kisi prakaar kii pareshaani kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa he
 Mustakim says that whenever he has any problem, he reaches Yogi Adityanath's public court with his plea and his problems are resolved immediately
 muslim samaaj se aane vaale yah tamaam log usee gorakhnath mandir main kaam karte hai, jahaan yogi adityanath rahete hai or usee yogi adityanath ko puujate hai jinaki chhavi mandir ke baahar ek muslim virdohi or ek kattar hindu netaa kii he
 It is the night of March 5, at half past eleven
 dilli ke lodhi road par sthit SSC ke daphtar ke baahar kaafii chahal-pahal he
 Around the police barricade some Delhi Police personnel are sitting on plastic chairs and at a distance from them about five hundred protesting students - students are sitting on the floor
 mausam main halki sardi he, aasmaan main puraa chand chamak rahaa he
 Except for a few street lights, the rest is working, the whole area is bathed with the milky moon and the yellow light of these street lights
 aasapaas thodi gandagi he, puraane akhbaar ke tukade, khaanaa khaane ke baad idhar-udhar phenk die gaye plastic ke jhuthe done, packetband pani ke khaali packet idhar-udhar pade hue hai
 However, students, students who are sitting on the road, are not taking much difference from this mess as if they are now part of their lives
 sabalog bade dhyaan se swaraj india se jude yogendra yadav ko sun rahe hai
 Yogendra Yadav is advising them to remain united and is expressing their support to them
 to abtak aap samaj hi gaye honge ki baat un pradarshnkaree chaatro kii ho rahi he jo pichley saat dinon se dilli ke lodhi road par sthit karmchaaree chayan ayog ke daphtar ke aage pradarshan kar rahe hai
 The most important demand of the protesting students is that all kinds of examinations conducted by the Staff Selection Commission should be conducted by the CBI in due time
 ravivaar ek khabar ai thi ki karmchaaree chayan ayog ne pradarshnkaree chaatro kii maang maan lee he lekin in chaatro kaa maananaa he ki inke saath dhokhaa hua he or inaki koi maang nahin maani gai he
 Anyway, it's twelve o'clock at night
 calendar ke hisaab se din badal gaya he
 Yogendra Yadav has gone by saying his word
 pichley kai dinon se pradarshan kar rahe in chaatro main bechaini saafe dikh rahi he
 Due to restlessness, depression and anger, a situation has arisen among themselves
 lekin inhen main se kuch chaatr aage aakar bich-bachaav bhi kar rahe hai
 Most of the people are standing, some are moving here and there
 kul milakar sthiti waisi hi he jaise deshbhar main yuvaaon kii he
 It would also not be wrong to say that these students, who are in government jobs, living in Delhi, away from their families, have no experience of demonstrating, protesting or shouting slogans and are also a little nervous about the result
 inhen sabase zyaada dar pulisia kaarywai kii he
 It's one o'clock in the night aasapaas main ghoomane par dikhataa he ki thak chuke chaatr-chatraayen kaise kahin bhi so rahe hai
 Some have slept on paper bags, some have laid newspapers and they have covered the newspaper
 kuch log bich sadak par khule main so rahe hai to kuch ne kinare jaakar ped kii oot le lee he
 Some are in deep sleep, some are sleeping, while some people are listening to songs on their mobiles, watching the news
 is tarah se ye inaki chhathi raat he
 Yes, some people are eating dinner sitting nearby, the menu is - potato vegetable and puri
 aaj ye dono item garam-garam he so kuch log khate-khate kah rahe he, ‘are aaj to party he
 The hot vegetable, gharam distributes bread, banana and parleji biscuits during the whole day
 khaane-paane kaa intazaam ye log khud dekh rahe hai, aapas main chanda karke
 Most of the night stayers are boys, one or two girls who are sleeping nearby
 baat karne par maaloom chalaa ki yahan sabase zyaada diqqat shauchalay kii he
 Especially for girls, so most girls go at night
 pichley kai dinon se MCD kii gaadi kooda uthaane bhi nahin ai he so aasapaas gandagi kaa ambara laga hua he
 The Parliament session is also starting from today and these young people have high hopes from their mps
 wo khate-khate aapas main baat kar rahe hai, ‘koi naa koi saansad to uthayega hi
 Parliament is starting today
 aisa to nahin hona chahie ki koi hamaare mudde ko uthaae hi naa
 'these young men, standing in front of the Staff Selection Commission office located on Lodhi Road, Delhi, are taking many lessons together in the moonlight night
 wo kai baar hataasha ke gart main duube ja rahe hai or unka hi koi saathi unhen vahaan se baahar laa rahaa he
 He expresses disbelief towards the leaders but at the very second moment he is getting hopeful about the Parliament session starting today
 inhen dar he ki baahar baithi police kisi bhi raat andar aa jaaegi or laathiyon peet kar baahar kar degi
 But they are not even letting this fear dominate them
 khud ko vishwaas dilaate hai ki agar aisa kuch hua to ye raat or ye chaand inaki gavaahi degaa

 Many eelas have accumulated snow up to several feet
 lekin sena ko is baar ummid nahin he ki barfbaari kii vajah se use ghuspaith se raahat mil paaegi
 Several areas near the loc have covered a white sheet of snow from Rajouri in Jammu to the end of Kargil

 Hello, Ravish Kumar
 jiem food, jaev sanvardhit fasalon ke bare main aapaki koi raay he
 If not, then it does not matter, but if you do not see this dispute like a fairytale, it will be fine
 jahaan koi chand se aata he or kheti kisaani se lekar bhukhmaree tak kii samasya kaa hal kar jaataa he
 There are endless controversies around GM food around the world
 sarkarein, manzuri dene vaali agencia, jiem food ke beej banane vaali companiyaan, sabaki vishwasaneeyata ko lekar sawaal uthe hai
 You will find many documentaries on youtube, so many articles on many reliable websites
 philhal tivi ke liye ham chand sawaalon tak simit rahenge
 Is GM food right for our health? kya jiem food kheti kii samasya kaa achook samaadhaan he? Will GM food lead to corporate capture? jiem food ke beej ke daam par kiskaa niyantran hoga? Will GM food eliminate the biodiversity of our farms? mote taur par hamaare swasthya par asar or jiem bijon par companiyon ke ekadhikaar kaa sawaal mahatvapurn he
 Monopoly means that you will buy Bt gram seeds from the same company and the company will decide how much the price will be
 har saal nai beej kharidni hogi
 If a pesticide medicine fails, then the farmer is not even able to ask the companies why you had made such a claim
 beej ke bare main yahi haal he
 There is no reliable organization to control these things in our country
 ek jaankaar ne kaha ki agar sarkaar santusht hi he ki jiem food hona chahie to pusa jaise apane krishi sansthaanon ko kyon nahin kahati ki jiem bijon kaa utpaadan kare or kisaanon main baante
 If this is the solution then why does the government not provide it?
