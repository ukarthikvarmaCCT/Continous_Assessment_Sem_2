 tripal talaak ke masale par supreme court main duusare din kii sunwaayee chal rahi he
 Salman Khurshid is making his arguments in Islam about Nikah, Meher and divorce
 is par justise rohington nariman ne unase poocha ki islam main nikaah or talaaq ko lekar maujuud vyavastha main theori or vyaavhaarikta main jo antar he, kya aap ye bataanaa chaahate hai? kya aap chaahate hai ki supreme court us vyavastha ko lagu kare jo islam main he? is par salmaan khurshid ne kaha ki haa
 But the court should not make any law in this matter, rather it should tell the better way in Islam
 jab teesri baar talaak bolaa jaataa he to wo waapas nahin ho saktaa, lekin iske liye 3 maheene kaa vakt hota he
 Former law minister and Congress leader Salman Khurshid, who is personally assisting the court, said in my personal opinion, triple divorce is a sin
 AIMPLB kaa stand he ki tripal talaak ghinauna he lekin tab bhi vaid he
 Justice Kurian Joseph asked - Can anyone who is abusive according to religion be valid under the law? The Supreme Court asked that what is a sin that can be taken in Sharia? is par salmaan khurshid ne kaha ki nahin tehraaya ja saktaa chaahe wo sanvaidhanik taur par vaid ho to bhi
 People can make laws by saying that they have taken this sin from God? If triple talaq is made 1 divorce then 90% problems will be resolved at once
 teen maheene ke iddatkaal main pati-patni ko sulah kaa mauka diya chahie
 The Supreme Court asked that if triple divorce is specific in India, then other countries enacted a law and abolished triple divorce? Khurshid said that if there were similar problems, then those countries would have thought that it should be abolished
 meher kii baat par CJI ne kaha - That there is no need to hear at this time - agar tripal talaak khatm hoga to uske parinaamon par baad main faisla lenge
 - The issue here is not that some people are sitting and trying to decide and if the decision is not made then it is a different matter
 - lekin yahaan to ek hi vakt par ek shaks chaahe jahaan faisla le letaa he
 Salman Khurshid said - nikaahnaame main sharten likhi rahati hai jisase talaak dena mushkil ho jaataa he Justice Curian asked - kya nikaahnaame main likhaa janaa chahie ki tripal talaak nahin hoga? khurshid kii ore se bahes puri hui
 Justice Rohington said - tripal talaak islam main shaadi khatm karne kaa sabase bura or avaanchhneeya tarika he - Although triple divorce has been recognized as valid in various schools of Islam
 tippaniyan Senior lawyer Ram Jethmalani said - tripal talaak ghinauna he kyonki ye mahilaon ko talaak main baraabar ke adhikaar nahin milte CJI Khehar said that - tripal talaak kya parampara he yaa shariat kaa hissaa hai - Where is it applicable other than India - bahut saare log desh main maut kii sajaa ko sin yani paap maanate hai lekin kanuunan ye vaid he

 On this, Salman Khurshid said that it cannot be held even if it is constitutionally valid
 log ye kahkar ki is paap ko ishwar se liya he, kanoon bana sakate hai ? agar tripal talaak ko 1 talaak kar diya jaae to 90 fisadi dikkatein ek baar main dur ho jaaengi
 The husband and wife should be given a chance to reconcile during the three-month iddat
 supreme court ne poocha ki agar bharat main tripal talaak vishisht he to duusare deshon ne kanoon banaakar tripal talaak ko khatm kar diya? khurshid ne kaha ki isi tarah kii dikkatein ain hogi to un deshon ko laga hoga ki ise khatm kar dena chahie
 CJI said on Mehr's talk - ki is par sunwaayee kii philhal jarurat nahin - If the triple divorce ends, then the results will be decided later
 - yahaan mudda ye nahin he ki kuch log baithkar faisla karne kii koshish kar rahe hai or faisla nahin hota to wo alag baat he
 - But here at the same time, a person takes a decision
 salmaan khurshid ne kaha - Terms are written in the Nikahnama which makes it difficult to divorce justise courion ne poocha - Should it be written in the nikahnama that triple divorce will not happen? The debate was completed by Khurshid
 justise rohington ne kaha - Triple divorce is the worst and undesirable way to end marriage in Islam - haalanki tripal talaak ko islam ke vibhinn skool aaf thats main vaid mana gaya he

 sonia ne centre sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki desh main yah baat kisi se chhipi nahin ki centre kii modi sarkaar artiai kii sanstha ko apane nirankush agenda ko lagu karne main ek badi aadchan ke taur par dekhati ai he
 He further said that this law demands accountability and the BJP government has been clearly avoiding any kind of reply
 sonia ne kii artiai kii tarifsonia gandhi ne apane bayaan main kaha, "congress ke netritv vaali upie sarkaar kii sabase gauravshaalee uplabdhiyon main se ek 2005 main 'soochna kaa adhikaar kanoon' bananaa tha
 This historic law gave birth to an institution like the Information Commission, which in the last 13 years has changed the meaning of democracy to bring transparency in governance and administration and ensure accountability of governments to the general public
 upie ke artiai kanoon ko vishwa ke sarvshereshth jan saapeksh kanoonon main se ek mana gaya
 "explained the achievements of RTI," he added, "the RTI Act established a direct relationship between responsibility and responsibility between the government and the citizens and also decisively attacked corruption
 puure desh ke artiai kaaryakartaaon ne bhrashtachar ke unmoolan, sarkari nitiyon kii prabhaavashiltaa ke akalan tathaa notebandi va chunaav jaisi prakriyaaon kii kamiyon ko ujagar karne ke liye is kanoon kaa prabhavi dhang se upyog kiya
 "accusing the Modi government, attacking the Modi government," Sonia said, "there is no secret in the country that the Modi government at the center has seen the RTI institution as a major hurdle in implementing its autocratic agenda
" yah kanoon javabdehi maangata he or bhaajapa sarkaar kisi bhi tarah ke jawaab dene se saaf-saaf gurej karti ai he
 That is why in the first term of the BJP government, a large number of information commissioners posts remained vacant in the center and states under an agenda
 yahaan tak ki kendriya mukhya soochna ayukta kaa pad bhi das maheene tak khaali rahaa
 By doing all this, the goal of Modi government was only to make the RTI Act ineffective and toothless
 "lagaaya artiai ko kamjor karne kaa aropasonia ne aage kaha, "bhaajapa sarkaar ne ab artiai kanoon par apana nirnaayak prahaar bhi kar diya he
 To further weaken the effectiveness of this law, the Modi government has passed such amendments that will weaken the powers of Information Commissioners in an institutional manner and subject them to the compassion of the government
 lakshya saaf he- soochna ayukta sarkari adhikariyon kii tarah kaam karke sarkaar kii javabdehi sunishchit na kar paaen
 "reduced tenure of Information Commissioners: Sonia", he added, "the tenure of the post of Information Commissioners has been reduced from five to three years, subject to the decision of the Central Government
 2005 ke kanoon ke tahat unka kaarykaal puure paanch saal ke liye nirdhaarit tha, taaki wo sarkaar va prashasan ke hastkshep va dabaav se puri tarah mukt rahen
 But their autonomy has been completely sacrificed in the amended law
 sarkaar ke khilaaf soochna jari karne vaale kisi bhi soochna adhikari ko ab tatkaal hataaya ja saktaa he yaa phir pad se barkhaast kiya ja saktaa he
 This will dampen the enthusiasm of the Central and State Information Commissioners to discharge their duties and make the government accountable
 "sarkaar ke hastkshep se nahin bachenge soochna ayukta: soniyapani baat jari rakhte hue sonia ne aage kaha, "doosraa sanshodhan he- kendriya soochna ayuktaon ke vetan, bhatton va sharton ke niyam, jo chunaav ayuktaon ke baraabar the
 Now it will be decided afresh by the Central Government
 duusare shabdon main kahen, to unke vetan va bhatton ko modi sarkaar kii icchaanusaar kam-zyada kiya ja sakegaa
 With the right to reduce the tenure and allowances of these important posts, the Modi government has ensured that no senior self-respecting officer will accept working in such a tense and supervised environment
 in sanshodhano ke baad koi bhi soochna ayukta modi sarkaar ke hastkshep va nirdeshon se bachaa nahin rah sakegaa
 "appointment of favorite officers of Hoaghi government: Sonia", he added, "by this Modi government can appoint officers working at their behest as and when they want
 ve majaburi main sarkaar kii chapalusee ke liye kaam karenge or jin prashnon ke uttar sarkaar nahin dena chaahegi, un par maun saadh lenge
 We have opposed these amendments in Parliament and will continue to fight against them even further
 ham apane loktantric sansthaanon par is shadyantrakaari hamale kii kadi ninda karte hai or desh ke kalyaan ke vipareet liye ja rahe bhaajapa sarkaar ke nirnyon tathaa nirankush evam taanaashaahee gatividhiyon kaa nirantar virodh karte rahenge

 big bos ke ghar main ab bade level kii nautanki ho rahi he
 On Monday, police arrested Armaan Kohli, a participant of Bigg Boss 7
 kohli par sophia hayaat ne marpet kaa aarope lagaaya
 Armaan got bail the next day
 lekin jab ve police stesan se nikle, un par sade hue tamaato barasaaye gaye
 What happened at Bigg Boss house at 10 pm on 16 December 2013 shocked all the contestants
 is din bhi kisi duusare din kii tarah big bos ke ghar main pratiyogi apni bhoomika nibhaa rahe the
 Bigg Boss then called Armaan Kohli in the confession room and then asked him to leave the house
 saath hi vajah ke taur par armaan ko kisi zaruri kaam se ghar se baahar jane kii baat kahi gai
 But as soon as he got out of the house, Armaan Kohli did not see any friend nor any relative who came to meet him, but Lonavala's police was present who came to arrest Armaan
 big bos ke ghar main rahi unki saathi pratiyogi sofia hayaat kii shikaayat par police ne armaan ko giraftaar kar liya
 This is the first time in the reality show of Bigg Boss, when the contest of two contestants in the house has gone out of the threshold of the house and goes straight to the police station
 armaan or sofia ke talkh rishton ke bare main big bos ke pratiyogiyon se lekar darshak tak har koi vaakif he, lekin rishton kii ye talkhi armaan ko hawalat pahunchaa sakati he, aisa kisi ne nahin sochaa tha
 Abusive, abusive, threatening threats to watch, and this is the USP of the reality show Bigg Boss
 euaspy bole to unic sailing point
 That is, it is the reason that millions of people stick to the TV screen as soon as Bigg Boss starts
 magar, reality sho kii ye jutampazar is baar itani real ho jaaegi, ye kisi ne bhi nahin sochaa tha
 Sophia Hayat's complaint Armaan Kohli Arrested Bigg Boss' house started this mess when Armaan Kohli and Sophia Hayat were made the leaders of two different teams during a weekly task
 khilone banane ke is kaam ke dauraan donon ne naa sirf ek-duusare ke kaam karne ke taur tareeke par sawaal uthaae, balki khilaunon main bhi min-mekh nikaali
 From then on, the relationship of the two continued to grow
 lekin asli bavaal 4 disambar ko tab hua, jab sofia ghar main ek khaas jagah par safaai kii koshish kar rahi thi
 On this day, Bigg Boss had tasked the contestants of the house to sit in a buggy for a long time
 sofia ko is kaam se alag rakhaa gaya tha, jabaki armaan gaadi main baithne kii haalat main nahin the
 In such a situation, both of them were outside the vehicle and then Sophia suddenly threatened to come there with a bucket of water and a mopper with the intention of cleaning it
 bas ye baat armaan ko itani nagavar guzari ki usne sofia ko rokane kii koshish kii or isi chhina jhapati or gaali-galoch main moper kaa danda sofia kii gaal se ja laga
 This hot model of foreign origin started splashing with pain and humiliation and on seeing this, she announced Yalgar against Armaan on Bigg Boss too
 baat haath se baahar nikalate dekh kar big bos ne bich main dakhal di or donon ko apane canfeshan room main bulaayaa
 Tried to make a reconciliation, but this time like Sophia was determined to fight this or that side
 usne is maamle par big bos kii sari baton ko ansuna kar diya or armaan ko sabak sikhaane kii baat par adi rahi
 After this, what came out of Bigg Boss house on December 11, went directly to the police
 chunki maamla ek videshi model se mili shikaayat kaa tha, police bhi turant harakat main ai or armaan kohli ke khilaaf marpet, gaali-galouj or badasluki ke ilzaam main report darj kar lee
 And everything that happened after this has never happened before in the history of Bigg Boss
 ye or baat he ki baad main mahilaon ke andey tomaataron ke bich armaan ko phir se big bos ke ghar main entry mil gai
 Akhre Kushalbhai more than Armaan to Salman, is awesome
 ek taraf to jhagada itnaa hua ki baat thane tak pahunch gai or armaan kohli ko giraftaar hona padaa
 And on the other hand, the battle of Kushal took place within the boundary of the house according to the tradition of the house and it also became cold
 lekin ye big bos ke host salmaan khan the ki jinhen kushal ab bhi armaan se zyaada abir rahaa tha
 Salman's softness for Armaan was already known to the Bigg Boss audience
 lekin iske liye salmaan kushal ko yun baat-baat par rusavaa karenge, ye kisi ne bhi nahin sochaa tha
 But, this is true of this Big Boss
 salmaan or armaan main dosti itani gahari kyon?salmaan or armaan puraane dost hai
 Bandra Buddies
 armaan naa sirf mashhoor film produsar rajkumaar kohli ke bete hai, balki big bos kii pratiyogi tanisha mukherjee ke nae bwoyfrand bhi hai
 Yes, of the same Tanisha who is the sister-in-law of Ajay Devgan
 or chunki ajay devgan or salmaan main bhi daant kati roti kaa rishta he, armaan is lihaaz se bhi salmaan ke behad qareeb hai, lekin nijee jindagi kii ye nazdikiyaan yun chote parde par bhi haaavee ho jaaengi, ye dekhnaa yakeenan ajeeb he
 Why are not shown the crime inside the house? But here it is not just about Salman's attitude
 baat big bos banane vaali us company kii bhi he, jo baaten to badi badi karti hai, lekin jab use amal main laane kii baari aati he, to peeche hat jaati he
 Now take the battle of Sophia and Armaan
 ek taraf to donon ke bich ghar main itani tikhi ladaai or marpet hui, to duusari taraf big bos ne ve saare footage edit kar sachai par pardaa daal diya
 That is when Sophia complained to the police, then all the footage of the real fight of the two went to the police
 sawaal ye uthta he ki ghar ke andar hue jurm ko chhipaana, kya big bos kii niyat par sawaal khadey nahin karata?lekin baat kahin isse bhi aage kii he
 On the one hand, violence in the Bigg Boss house is misunderstood, while on the other hand Armaan, who was released after being arrested on the charge of violence, is again given a place in this house

 Farmers have come to the center of discussion amidst the hunger for government formation in Maharashtra
 kursi kii jang ke bich virdohi netaa ek-duusare se mulaakaat kar rahe hai
 The interesting thing is that behind these meetings, the farmers are being called upon and in the midst of this game of power, 6 farmers have committed suicide recently
 maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey 24 oktober ko aa gaye the, jisamen kisi bhi ek dal ko bahumat nahin mila tha, lekin bijepi or shivasena ke paas sarkaar banane ke liye paryaapt siten hone ke baavjood maharashtra ko nai sarkaar nahin mil pai he

 is baithak main mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis bhi maujuud rahe
 After the meeting, Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde said that there was a discussion on the problem of farmers and it was said that the relief package of 1 xxrep 4 0 crore is not enough
 kisaanon ke mudde par bijepi-shivasena kii baithkvahin, bijepi netaa sudhir mungantiwar ne baithak ke baad bataaya ki aaj kii charchaa sirf kisaanon se judi thi, sarkaar gathan ko lekar koi baatcheet nahin hui he
 However, he definitely said that good news could come anytime soon

 However, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and his son Aditya Thackeray have gone and met them among the aggrieved farmers
 deepawali main aatishbaajee na ho, aisa to ho nahin saktaa, magar is deepawali par aatishbaajee kaa bazaar suunaa rahane ke asaar hai
 Say the same thing, this time the interest of fireworks can be expensive for the common people
 isaki vajah he pichley saal kii tulana main is saal aatishbaajee ke daamon main 50 se 60 fisadi pratishat tak kii badhotaree
 In fact, circumstances have also changed in the last few years in Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu
 niyam-kanoon bhi sakht ho gaye hai
 Secondly, now the trust of people on Chinese firecrackers has also decreased, because most of the Chinese firecrackers are not well and they remain a danger
 deshi pataakhon main khatra adhik hone kii vajah se jila prashasan ne tej aawaaj ke pataakhe banane or bechney par pehle hi roak laga di he
 Wholesale traders are also adding their profits due to supply shortage and inflation
 matlab saaf he ki pichley varsh jo log ek hajaar rupee kaa pataakhaa jalaate the, unhen is varsh vahi pataakhaa 1500 se 1600 rupee main milegaa
 Crackers up to 10 rupees will be found of very poor quality
 thok vyavsaayiyon kii maane to 50 rupee se neeche acha pataakhaa milanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Fireworks Trade Welfare Association President Akhilesh Gupta says that only firecrackers made at Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu are supplied throughout the country
 haal ke kuch varshon main shivakashi main hue haadason ke baad se vahaan bhi aatishbaajee kaa kaarobaar kaaphi kam ho gaya he
 He said that the rules and regulations have become so strict that apart from loud firecrackers, there has been a ban on making more ammo crackers
 upar se mahangaai or naksali ilaakon main barood kii badhati khapat ke andeshe ke chalate bhi prashasan dukandaaron par nigaraanee rakh rahaa he
 Gupta said that raw materials including paper made in firecrackers have also become twice as expensive
 duusari taraf is baar tamilnadu main monsoon bhi kaaphi der se aayaa, or vahaan ab bhi kaaphi barish ho rahi he
 The crackers made have not dried up either
 upar se mahangaai ne aatishbaajee bazaar kii qamar tod di he
 Wholesalers are still getting fireworks in small quantities despite ordering in advance
 kaccha maal mahangaa hone ke kaaran bhi aatishbaajee ke daam bade hai
 Officials of the organization say that they are trying their best to make all kinds of crackers available to the people of the capital, but this time traders will not be able to compromise the price
 tay daam par hi pataakhaa milegaa

 But it is clear that Pakistan, which is facing economic crisis, is not fit to face any more economic sanctions
 isliye islamabad kii puri koshish hogi ki wo blike list main shaamil hone se batch sake

 After a joint discussion on the Bill 2017, the amendments of some members were passed unanimously, rejecting them
 dhan vidheyak hone ke kaaran in chaaron vidheyakon par ab rajyasabha ko keval charchaa karne kaa adhikaar hoga

 He said, "now a similar tax cannot be levied on thongs and BMW cars
 ’’ jetali ne kaha ki jiesti parishad main charchaa ke dauraan yah tay hua ki aarambh main kai kar lagaana zyada saral hoga
 The Finance Minister said that the GST Council has fixed rates of 0, 5, 12, 18 and 28 percent in the GST regime after discussions
 lakjri kaaron, bottle band vaatit peyon, tambaakoo utpaada jaisi ahitkar vastuon evam koyala jaisi paryaavaran se judi saamagree par iske upar atirikt upkar bhi lagane kii baat kahi he
 He said that the cess levied by more than 28 percent will go to the Compensation Fund and the states which are suffering losses will be given out of it

 Jaitley said that compensation will be given to those states which are suffering losses due to the implementation of GST system

 This is the meaning of this provision
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki real estate kii tarah hi sthiti sharaab or petroleum utpaadon ke sambandh main bhi thi
 Petroleum products have been brought under its purview after discussions with the states but it has been kept under zero rate for now
 is par jiesti parishad vichaar karegi
 Alcohol is still outside its scope

 jetali ne kaha ki jiesti parishad pehali sangheey nirnay karne vaali sanstha he
 The GST Council was given the authority to enact model legislation on the basis of constitutional amendment
 jahaan tak kanoon banane kii baat he to yah sangheey dhaanche ke aadhaar par hoga, vahiin sansad or rajya vidhansabhaon kii sarvocchata bani rahegi
 However, these recommendations have to be kept in mind because if different states decide different rates then chaotic situation will arise

 Clarifying the situation on objections about having multiple tax rates instead of creating a uniform tax, the Finance Minister said that there are many food products which are currently taxed at zero and no tax will be levied even after the GST system is implemented
 kai chijen aisi hoti hai jin par ek samaan dar se kar nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 For example, the rates of tobacco, alcohol, etc
 are high while the normal rate on clothes

 There was also a suggestion that it should be taxed

 But no additional tax will be levied on consumers
 jetali ne kaha ki muaavja un rajyon ko diya jaayegaa jinhen jiesti pranali lagu hone se nuksaan ho rahaa ho

 It earns the states income from registry and other charges, hence it is not included in the GST based on the opinion of the states
 unhone yah bhi spasht kiya ki jiesti parishad main koi bhi faisla lene main centre kaa vot keval ek tihaai he jabaki do tihaai vot rajyon ko he
 Therefore, the Center is not in favor of imposing its opinion while making any decision

 There are many things that cannot be taxed at the same rate

 He said, "now a similar tax cannot be levied on thongs and BMW cars
 ’’ jetali ne kaha ki jiesti parishad main charchaa ke dauraan yah tay hua ki aarambh main kai kar lagaana zyada saral hoga
 The Finance Minister said that the GST Council has fixed rates of 0, 5, 12, 18 and 28 percent in the GST regime after discussions
 lakjri kaaron, bottle band vaatit peyon, tambaakoo utpaada jaisi ahitkar vastuon evam koyala jaisi paryaavaran se judi saamagree par iske upar atirikt upkar bhi lagane kii baat kahi he
 He said that the cess levied by more than 28 percent will go to the Compensation Fund and the states which are suffering losses will be given out of it

 But imposition of tax would have affected consumers
 lekin upabhoktaaon par atirikt kar nahin lagaaya jaayegaa

 Will give
 ’gauratlab he ki rabindra jadeja shanivaar ko chennai kii jeet ke hero rahe, jab team ko antim gend par jeet ke liye 2 ran kii darkaar thi
 If RP Singh, who threw the last over, did not bowl the last ball, then Jadeja would have been caught out on the third man and Bangalore would have won the match
 chennai ko antim over main 16 ran chahie the
 Dhoni then made jokes on his teammates and tickled his millions of fans

 ’dhoni ne ek or shandaar twit main kaha, ‘sar jadeja jab apni jeep chalaate hai to unki jeep khadi rahati he or sadak chalane lagati he

 Jadeja's Chennai team and team India teammate Suresh Raina also congratulated the all-rounder for playing the winning innings in the match against Bangalore

 unhone kaha ki kanoon pravartan agenciyon yah sunishchit karegi ki desh kii chhavi bigaadane vaale dandit hon
 He praised the appeal of peace to Tariq Jahan, whose son was among the three young British Asian youth who were crushed to death

 He said, i have also said earlier that there is a big problem in our society that children do not recognize right and wrong

 bambaia filmon kii tarah romaanch or clymex se bhari is patakatha kaa asli lekhak he-soobe ke 62 jilon main 8 fisadi se zyada or inamen se 31 jilon main 12 fisadi se zyada brahman vot
 For this reason, do not show the leader to Panditji, but definitely want the hand of a Brahmin on the head
 8 farvari 2012: tasveeron main india tudebrahmanon ke aashirwad ke liye partiyaan apni-apni taraf se aise brahman chehre pesh karne main lagi hai, jo panditon ko ekamusth na sahi to kam-se-kam footkar taur par hi apni ore khinch saken
 But the problem is that these faces do not even have the power to call themselves a universal leader, far from a great personality like Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru or magnetic attraction like Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 jabaki pradesh ke itihaas par najar daalen to yahaan ab tak bane 19 mukhyamantriyon main se sabase adhik 6 mukhyamantri brahman jati se hi aae or ye sabhi congress ke the
 This was followed by 4 Thakurs, 4 backward, 3 Vaishyas, 1 Kayastha and a Dalit Chief Minister

 1 February 2012: In the pictures, India Today, BSP, which gave the first Dalit Chief Minister to the state, has been putting full emphasis on the dalit-brahmin alliance since the 2002 assembly elections
 party ne satish chandra mishra ke taur par apana brahman cheharaa saamne kiya he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has Brahmin faces like Kalraj Mishra and Murali Manohar Joshi
 congress ke sho-cese main reeta bahuguna-joshi, pramod tiwari pehle se hi hai, ab janardan dvivedi, shila dikshit or haryana se prachaar ke liye bulaae gaye maangeram sharma jaise ansune naam bhi aa gaye hai
 However, many Congressmen believe that the biggest representation of Brahmins is by the nehru-gandhi family itself
 samaajawaadee party brahmanon ko lekar bahut hai-tauba machaati najar nahin aati or ashok vaajapeyi jaise brahman netaa party main kabhi-kabhaar najar aa jate hai
 Looking at the bsp's strategy to woo Brahmins, the party started meetings of Satish Chandra Mishra before Mayawati in Uttar Pradesh
 2002 main basapa se brahmanon ko jodne kaa sehara sir par baandhe gum rahe mishra brahman bhaichara sammelnon main bhaashan kii shuruyaat kuch is andaaj main karte hai, ‘sabhi brahmanon ko charan sparsh
 Just as in the Treta era, Shabri and Valmiki together succeeded Ramraj, the last time Brahmins and Dalits together formed the BSP government
 ’25 janvari 2012: tasveeron main dekhen india todeage vah isi puranic aakhyaan kii pandulipi par jatigat aankadon kii majboot jild chadhaate hai, ‘15 fisadi brahman or 23 fisadi dalit ikattha hokar kuch bhi kar sakate hai
 Although the figure of 15 per cent of the Brahmins population is somewhat exaggerated, but in the absence of official figures, all are running their own figures
 basapa ne 2007 main 80 or is vidhaan sabha chunaav main 74 brahman ummidavaaron ko hathi par savaar karaayaa he
 The party is challenging the BJP in giving tickets to Brahmins
 itane bade paimaane par panditon ko tikat dene ke baavjood basapa ke hi kai netaaon ko lagata he ki dalit-brahman kaa asahaj gathjod kaath kii handi jaisaa he, jise dubaara chadhaanaa mushkil he
 Congress leader Pramod Tiwari lashed out at the bsp's Brahmin love, saying, "the BSP has disrespected the Brahmins
 ranganath mishra, rakeshdhar treepathi, rajesh treepathi aadi, puri qatari he, basapa se beizzat hue brahmanon kii
 When did that party become friendly to Brahmins? ’ unki party kis tarah brahmanon ko tarjeeh de rahi he or congress kaa brahman cheharaa koun he? is sawaal par tiwari ne kaha, ‘congress jaat-paant kii baat nahin karti
 Rahul ji is the face of the party
 nehru ji, indira ji or rajeev kii chhavi janata rahul ji main dekhati he
 'even though the Congress Legislature Party leaders in the Assembly give diplomatic answers directly to the question of bringing Brahmin politics or face, the reality is that the party is looking for Brahmin faces for every locality
 rahul gandhi ne janvari main jab bundelkhand kaa daura kiya to mul rup se banda nivasee janardan dvivedi ko lagaataar apane saath banaae rakhaa or brahman chehre ke taur par pesh kiya
 In Bundelkhand, Jhansi, Lalitpur, Jalaun, Banda and Chitrakoot districts have more than 12% of Brahmin voters
 daliton ke baad yah doosraa sabase bada vot bank he
 January 18, 2012: See India Today in the pictures, in eastern Uttar Pradesh, which raised the Congress flag in the last Lok Sabha election, Pratapgarh, Faizabad, Balrampur, Gonda, Siddharth Nagar, Basti, Sant Kabir Nagar, Maharajganj, Gorakhpur, Kushinagar, Deoria, Jaunpur, The average attendance of Brahmin voters in Varanasi, Ravidas Nagar, Mirzapur and Sonbhadra sits between 14 and 15 per cent
 bhole baba kii nagari banaras main yah aankada 16 fisadi tak he
 In these areas, the BSP also got bulk seats in 2007
 congress ke saamne brahman chehron ko aage laane kii chunauti isliye bhi zyada he kyonki basapa kii tulana main uske brahman pratyaashee bahut kam yani mahaj 42 hai
 The basic principles of Mandal politics emerged in the tickets distributed by the party this time and the backwards got a lot of tickets
 lekin party nahin chaahati ki pichhadon ke chakkar main brahman paas na aaen
 That is why Sheila Dixit from Delhi and Mangeram Sharma from Haryana have also been called for campaigning
 party ke brahman chehre ke sawaal par party kii pradesh adhyaksh reeta bahuguna-joshi kahati hai, ‘pramod tiwari hai, main hum or or nehru-gandhi parivaar to khud brahman he
 Rahul ji is the biggest face of the party
 aise main alag se brahmanon kii baat hi nahin uthati
 'but when asked the effect of getting less tickets to Brahmins from Congress than other parties, he said,' Brahmin is prudent
 vah ekamusth kabhi vot nahin karata
 The vote of Brahmins always goes to different places
 isliye pratyaashiyon kii sankhya koi bada sawaal nahin he
 Rita herself is in the fray from Lucknow and the Brahmin votes in Kanpur, Ramabai Nagar (kanpur Dehat) and Lucknow in central Uttar Pradesh are 17, 13 and 13 per cent respectively
 11 janvari 2012: tasveeron main dekhen india tudenjar bhaajapa kii bhi kamjor nahin he
 After reaching the pinnacle of power in the state on the strength of temple politics and RSS volunteers, Brahmin voters are also important for the BJP which has fallen badly
 party ne 73 brahman maidan main utaare hai
 But despite having so many Brahmins, the party does not understand whom to present as a Brahmin face
 bhaajapa ne basapa kii tarah sidhe brahman sammelan nahin kiya, lekin 1 janvari ko kanpur main chanakya sammelan main murali manohar joshi kii maujuudagi ke jariye party ne apni hasaraton ke sanket die
 The second Brahmin face of the party is Kalraj Mishra
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ke baad bhaajapa main koun sabase bada brahman cheharaa he, is sawaal par mishra ne kaha, ‘vaajapeyi ji party ke sheersh netaa hai
 We do politics of development, not a particular community
 party ne brahman, thakur, obisi sahit sabhi samudaayon ko tikat die hai
 BJP will come to power only with the support of every community
 ’lekin brahmanon kaa sahyog kitna ahm he, yah bhaajapa ne pichley loksabhaa chunaav main dekha, jisamen uski 10 main se aadhi siten pashchimi uttar pradesh se ain
 Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Mahamaya Nagar, Mathura and Auraiya districts in western Uttar Pradesh have 12 percent or more Brahmin voters
 mathura main to 17 fisadi brahman voter hai
 Well the funny thing is that the BJP is still considering Atal Bihari Vajpayee's name as its biggest player in the state
 party ke chunaav ghoshnaptr par atal ji kii tasviir he or hording par bhi vahi chhaae hue hai
 Perhaps one reason for this is that the party wants to capitalize on Atal ji's appeal and his image among the Brahmins
 04 janvari 2012: tasveeron main dekhen india tudekharaab swasthya ke kaaran yah diggaj netaa maidan main bhale najar na aae, lekin prachaar kaa chunavi jhanda unke naam ke sahare hi laharaa rahaa he
 On the other hand, Samajwadi Party does not bring the word Brahmin to the tongue even after giving tickets to 50 Brahmins
 party kii netaaon kii fehrist main mulaayam singh yadav ke parivaar ke alaava ajam khan kaa naam hi najar aata he
 The party has some Brahmin faces like Ashok Vajpayee but does not figure prominently
 udhar, 46 siton par chunaav lard rahe rashtriya lokdal ke adhyaksh ajit singh se jab poocha gaya ki musalamaanon ko lekar to aap bahut pareshaan hai, lekin brahman cheharaa kahin he? is sawaal par ajit singh ne kaha, ‘hamane kai brahman pratyaashee utaare hai
 In districts like Mathura, the RLD will need considerable support from the Brahmins
 28 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india todefilhal yahi dikh rahaa he ki party ke bade brahman chehre jo kaam nahin kar paaenge, vah kaam sthaneey pratyaashee kar saktaa he kyonki uttar pradesh siyasat ke us mode par he jahaan, party ke chunaav chinh se zyada badi chhap pratyaashee ke naam or kaam kii hogi
 It is so clear that the Brahmin, who has been away from the cm's chair for 23 years, is now seeing himself in the role of King Maker, not King

 What are the signs of the auspiciousness of Brihaspati? - The person is learned and knowledgeable, gets great respect - the person has divine grace and the person is saved from all the problems in life - such people are common Religion in general, Do not consume salt on this day - plant a banana tree in the back of the house and add water to it in the morning - chant the mantras of Jupiter - reciting Vishnu Sahastranam in the morning is also very beneficial - respect the elders of the house And plant a fruitful tree - if Jupiter is inauspicious, then you should not wear garland and gold around your neck, if Jupiter is inauspicious and is giving deadly results then what measures should be taken? Mix turmeric in the morning and offer water to the Sun- Keep a square piece of gold or brass with you

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne maal evam seva kar (jiesti) ke slab se jude pradhanmantri narendra modi ke ek bayaan ko lekar brihaspativaar ko un par nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha ki unki party ne ‘gabbar singh tex' par pradhanmantri ko gahari neend se jagaa diya he, lekin vah ab bhi halki jhapai le rahe hai
 He also said that the Prime Minister wants to implement the Congress' idea which was called 'grand Stupid Thought' (very nonsense idea)
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne twit kar kaha, ‘‘aakhirkaar congress party ne narendra modi ji ko gabbar singh tex par gahari neend se jagaa diya
 Although he is taking a nap, he now wants to implement the Congress idea of what he called 'grand Stupid Thought'
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘narendra modi ji, der aae durust aae
 In fact, the Prime Minister had indicated on Tuesday that in the coming times, 99 per cent of goods may fall in the GST 18 per cent slab
 modi ne ek nijee channel ke kaarykram main kaha ki centre sarkaar 99 fisadi vastuon ko 18 fisadi ke slab main laane par kaam kar rahi he
 Currently, GST has only 35 items at the highest 28 per cent rate
 jo bache rah jaaenge, ve kam upyogita ke yaa vilasita ke saamaan bhar honge
 For example, luxury cars, alcohol, private aircraft, cigarettes, pan-masala or tambaakoo utpaada jaise saamaan
 The argument is that even if there is an immediate fall in government earnings, it will benefit later as the NITI Aayog vice-chairman welcomed the proposal while talking to NDTV
 rajeev kumaar ne kaha, "philhal 97% saamaan 18% yaa uske neeche ke tex slab main aate hai
 We welcome the announcement of the Prime Minister
 kuch or chizon par tex kam karnaa chahie
 Above 18% are items that are called non-merit goods
 sharaab, cigarette, badi yaa aayaat kii gai mahangi gaadiyaan aadi hi 28% ke tex slab main hon
 There cannot be a tax slab in India because there are many variations in people's income in India
 " (input-bhashaa) Debate on air pollution of Delhi in Rajya Sabha Prakash Javadekar discussed the proposal in the Rajya Sabha on some situation in the House, especially in Delhi, on the situation due to dangerous levels of air pollution
 is dauraan satta paksh or vipaksh ke bich kaaphi tikhi bahes bhi hui
 Finally, Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu called the environment minister to make his point
 paryaavaran mantri ne is mudde par sarkaar kaa paksh rakhaa or daawa kiya ki ham jald hi pradooshan jaldi khatm karenge
 Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said that thanks to everyone, who gave the idea above party politics
 desh ko hamen teji se aage badhanaa he
 If everyone walks in one direction, then a common minimum program is needed
 aaj kai suzav aae
 Every city has its own position
 desh bhar kii baat karenge to pradooshan ke chaar hi pramukh kaaran hai
 He further said that every city has a different state of environment, so work should be done in different ways everywhere
 122 shaharon main polution thodaa zyada he isliye hamane neshnal ection for clin air kaarykram taiyaar kiya or har shahar kaa pradooshan dekh kar uskaa kaarykram bananaa uskaa plan he
 On this, there is a need for mass movement, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar further said that why we do not use bicycles for the work around
 main pichley 8 saal se electric scooter kaa istemaal karata hum
 Electric car came and brought it
 ye aapkaa kaam he ki aap vaahan kaa piyusi sahi rakhen, lambey signal par gaadi band karen
 There is a need for a mass movement on this
 trephic kaa polyushan kam karne ke liye polyushan he yah maananaa bhi jaruri he
 Referring to the works of the Modi government, the Union Minister said that we used to use fuel of BS-3 till 2014 but now we have focused on BS-6
 17 hajaar karod rupee kharch kar peripheral express ve bana, usase 7 hajaar vaahan dilli main aane band hue
 There is dust pollution here, i saw the tunnel work of the metro and there was no dust then i sent the officers there
 uske baad hamane nai niyam banaae
 Today, 3000 tons of goods are being prepared every day
 construction demolision niyam taiyaar hua
 There are new norms in new industries, there will be less pollution because electricity is also needed
 electric vaahan par kaam kiya, sabsidi di
 Javadekar said - We will end pollution quickly
 He further said that we will assure that pollution will end quickly
 iske liye sadaa prayaas karnaa chahie
 There is no switch that turns on and off
 sabko ek saath kaam karne kii jarurat he
 If Ujjwala got 8 crore women, the pollution did not decrease, if the leds were installed in 40 crore houses, the pollution was reduced
 yah ek neshnal program he, iske liye aap sabakaa saath chahie
 Law Minister Jitendra Singh Tomar Koferjee degree in Delhi government may come as a major setback
 dilli baar council ne shuruaati jaanch main tomars kii degree ko farji paaya he or is babat aapraadhik maamla darj karne kii baat kahi he
 The Delhi Bar Council has made a written complaint to the DCP of South Delhi

 The Bar Council has appealed to the police for a detailed investigation into the entire case and demanded that a criminal case be also registered if needed

 dilli baar council ke secretary punit mittal ne apni shikaayat main dilli police se 28 may tak maamle main states report daakhil karne ko kaha he
 What is the matter that the law minister of Delhi, Jitendra Singh Tomarkhud, describes himself as a law graduate from Tilakamanjhi University in Bihar
 jabaki vishvavidhyalay ne dilli hai court ko bataaya ki tomars kaa pramaan patr asli nahin he or yah vishvavidhyalay ke record main nahin he
 According to Tilka Manjhi University, the serial number recorded on the certificate is not in the name of another student but Tomar
 kya kahana he mantri kadusri ore, mantri tomars kaa kahana he ki unki degree 100 fisadi asli he
 Responding to the allegations in the past, he said, 'soon the reality will be revealed
 maine kuch bhi galat nahin kiya
 My degree is real
 iskaa faisla adaalat karegi
 Tomar said, 'all the allegations against me are baseless
 agar maine kuch galat kiya hota to niyamit taur par karyaalay nahin aata
 Very soon i will reveal all the records from the university and make everything clear
 ' tomars ke paas paryaton, kala evam samskruti or grih mantralay bhi he

 peshey se chartered acountint rajeev camel bittu kii bitiyaa ne bihar ke gopalganj ke unke paitruk gaanv main jab padosiyon ko ganda kahkar god main jane se inkaar kar diya, to unako bada jhatka laga tha
 With a decent income from his 150 sqft office in Ranchi, Rajiv could have led a good life but after this incident he took the path of heat, sweat and hard work
 sie rajeev ab ek kisaan main badal gaye
 To give modern farming to the cultivation of the country, there was a need for the involvement of youth
 desh ke kai hisson main noujvaan aisa kar bhi rahe hai
 Some of these jigglers came to farming like Rajiv from their frozen profession, while some turned the farming sector into business
 lekin phulon kii kheti ho yaa machhlipaalan, deyari ho yaa sabji, har kshetra main yuvaaon ne apni chhap chodi he
 Rajiv Kamal Bittu of Ranchi was a novice in terms of farming
 so, unhone kai jagahon se kheti ke bare main jaankaree hasil kerani shuru kii-internet, birsa krishi vishvavidhyalay ke professor or sthaneey kisaanon se baatcheet kii
 Acquiring land in Jharkhand was extremely difficult for him, as the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act did not allow him to buy land
 tab unhone ranchi ke paas hi kuchchu gaanv ke ek jameen maalik ko khet lij par dene ko raji kar liya
 However, Rajiv got about 2 to make that bushed land cultivable
 5 lakh rupye kaa nivesh karnaa padaa
 Before the start of the winter of 2013, Rajiv arranged drip irrigation, etc
, and planted watermelon and melon crops in this field
 ve kehete hai, ''maine kheti ko aadhunik banane ke liye bas kuch buniyadi baton kaa khyaal rakhaa
 Tried to keep costs down and sowed a crop that does not cost much labor
 " rajeev hansate hue bataate hai ki laagat ko lekar unka sie vaala najariya behad kaam aayaa
 He never sowed a crop whose weight is light
 masalan, matar
 But he must always apply peas before planting watermelon
 isse mitti main nitrogen kii maatra sthir ho jaati he or unki fasal behatar aati he
 While cultivating from a scientific perspective, Rajiv initially broke and removed some fruits when there were more fruits in the melon vines in his fields
 unka kahana he, zyada fal aane se puri fasal kii gunvattta par asar padataa
 Rajiv's net profit from the first crop was Rs 7 lakh
 ke kareeb tha
 Inspired by his success, Rajiv has leased 13 acres of land in Anandi village in Ormanjhi block of Ranchi
 ve kehete hai, ''meri kheti se khet maalikon ko phayda hota he kyonki ek to main unhen prati acre 5 se lekar 10,000 ru
 i pay an annual rent and they also have to work on their own farm
 isse unki aamadani pehle se adhik he
 "now Rajiv also crops cucumber, sweet corn, and cherry tomato in his fields besides watermelon and melon
 adhik nafe ke liye unhone apni sari fasal hoseller ko dene kii bajaae uskaa takreeban aadha hissaa apane logon ke jariye khudara bechnaa shuru kiya
 This also increased net profits
 ve neem kii pattiyon or karanja kii pattiyon kaa istemaal kitnashak ke taur par karte hai
 Rajiv further adds, "I do not sow melon seeds directly in the fields
 balki iske bichade taiyaar karata hum
 By keeping a gap of a fortnight in the planting of these bitches, there is also a difference of two weeks in the arrival of my crop
 isse marketing main phayda hota he
 "with his business intelligence, Rajiv has transformed farming into a lucrative business

 The Union Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thawarchand Gehlot introduced the Constitution Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday in view of the provision of 10 percent reservation for poor Indians of the general category
 bill par charchaa ke dauraan thavarchand gahalot ne sadan ko bataaya ki agar unke faisle ke khilaaf koi supreme court main bhi jaataa he to yah nirnay nirast nahin ho paaegaa or garib savarna aarakshan kaa laabh le paaenge
 Ever since the Modi cabinet's decision on Monday, it is being said by various experts, including political parties, that the government's decision to provide 10 percent reservation to the poor of the general class will be rejected in the Supreme Court
 , Because it is against the constitution
 isi bindu par safai dete hue thavarchand gahalot ne bataaya ki pehle sarkaron dwaara kiye gaye is tarah ke prayaas supreme court ne isliye nirast hue hai, kyonki un sarkaron ne samvidhan main sanshodhan kiye bina wo faisle liye the
 While giving this argument, Thawarchand Gehlot expressed his confidence and said that we have taken this decision thoughtfully
 unhone kaha, 'hamaari sarkaar ne soch samajhakar yah nirnay liya he or samvidhan ke anuchhed 15 or 16 main sanshodhan kiye hai
 Which are going to be passed in the House
 iske baad yah adhinium banegaa, phir yah praavdhaan lagu honge
 Thawarchand Gehlot said that after the provision is implemented, if anyone goes to the Supreme Court against it, then i believe the Supreme Court will reject his point and the government's decision will be accepted
 jisase desh kaa har vah garib naagarik jo obisi or essi-asti aarakshan kaa laabh nahin paa rahaa he, use iskaa phayda milegaa
 Let us tell you that many state governments have taken such decisions in the past, which have been rejected by going to the Supreme Court

 Spiritual gurus are not always Indians, although India seems to be their natural habitat
 ve har us insaan ko aakarshith karte hai jo vaastaviktaa ke bare main ek romani najariya rakhte hai
 The pessimistic view considers life to be a storehouse of impassable calamities, where many human desires are destined to remain incomplete and end with the death of man
 is nazariye ke vipareet romani nazariye main jivan dukhamay nahin he, balki sukh kaa anveshan he
 This exploration goes on for many lifetimes
 ye baba or aadhyatmik guru is ''ucch'' vaastaviktaa tak pahunchane kaa vaada karte hai, jo chamatkaaron or jivan tathaa chetana main buniyadi badlaavon se bharaa hoti he
 This was not always the case
 veda or upanishdon ke aarambhik kaal main aaj kii tarah ke tathakthith bhagwaan nahin hote the balki guru yaa buddha upadeshak hote the, jo chamatkaari baba kii tarah nahin balki ek shikshak kii tarah aadhyatmikta kaa gyaan dete the or shishyon ko apane khud ke anubhavon se paaramparik upadeshon kii pariksha lene kii sikh dete rahete the
 The transformation that took place from teacher Guru to mystical guru and then self-proclaimed Gods gained the most momentum with the emergence of the Bhakti movement in north and south India in the 7th century
 or 1000 i
 With the spread of tantric sects around, the Gurus not only began to show the way of union with God, but they also became God themselves
 guru ab bhagwaan ho gaye, jinke paas tamaam daivi shaktiyon se las asaadhaaran vyaktitv tha
 After this, the worship of the feet of these gurus, prostrating and worshiping, and other devotions of respect started due to devotion
 daivi vardaan yaa guru kaa prasad bantane laga
 And the Gurushiphi tradition deteriorated to this changed form
 ab mukhya shabd 'prem' ho gaya, na ki 'gyaan'
 The intricacies of thought could easily be sidelined because the wisdom of the Upanishads was no longer listening, contemplating or contemplating the way to reach God, but rather to say in the idiom of North India in the shelter of these gods So completely surrendered with body, mind and money
 kabir ke shabdon main-pothee padhapadh jag muaa,pandit bhayaa na koy,dhai aakhar (akshar) prem kaapadhe so pandit hoy
 When the Guru started becoming human from God, along with that the disciple also started changing from adult to child
 ab adarsh shishy vah he, jo kabhi kisi baat par sawaal na kare, hriday se shuddh ho or usamen ek vayask ke koi gun na hon, khaskar taarkik sawaal karne kaa gun
 Such images of Guru and disciple and their ideal relationship are still deeply rooted in the Hindu mindset
 kuch aadhunik bharatiyon ko lagata hoga ki ye dharmaguru hindu samaaj kii sabhi bauddhikta virdohi or adhikaaravaadi pravriti kaa kavdr hai
 Yet for the large population of Hindus, this god remains a light beam for them
 in bhagavaanon kaa durnivaar aakarshan tark par ataarkikta kii vijay, swaittata ke upar daasatv kii vijay yaa pracheen swarnyug ke upar samakaleen andhe yug kii vijay ke kaaran hi nahin he balki uske peeche kahin zyada jatil vajahen kaam kar rahi hai
 a major reason for the existence of these Gods is the belief that they have divine power through which they can overcome the physical and mental suffering
 vyaadhiyaan dur karne kaa kaam in baabaaon or deviyon main spasht dekha ja saktaa he
 His fame is mainly due to the news of treating ailments, rather than extracting some spiritual or philosophical interpretation from a traditional scripture
 anek baabaaon ke anuyaayiyon se hui apni baatcheet main maine paaya ki chamatkaari upachaar kii kahaniyon ke kaaran hi in logon kaa unke prati aakarshan hua or isane unke anuyaayiyon kii jamaat ko failaane main madad kii
 There were also some devotees, in whose case healing was a quiet process, after Baba's arrival in their lives, the dark clouds of despair left, perhaps due to a new vision
 to kuch log bachapan main matapita ke saath sambandhon ke ghaav ko bharne ke liye baabaaon yaa deviyon kii sharan gaye, unhen ek adarsh matapita ke rup main dekha
 These babas or goddesses gave them new life by giving them a second chance to regain their lost self-power, re-instilling intimacy and power in the person's life
 guru or anuyaayi main aamnasamna ke dauraan upachaar ke kshan kii prabalata hi guru kii chhavi ko divya matapita kaa rup de detii he or bhakt ko balak kaa
 For those who are influenced by the egalitarian modern ideology started in the West, the easy-going attitude of a follower to a Baba's charisma reflects a lack of self-sufficiency and mental helplessness, which is achieved by identifying with Baba or Guru or by There is a need to redress the norm
 bhakthi ke maarg kii vijay ke baad se is aatmasamarpan ke bare main paaramparik bhartiya soch buniyadi rup se ekadam alag he or kahin zyada sakaaratmak he
 The sense of surrender to the Guru is born out of two major foundations of human perception
 ye hai- kisi ko adarsh maan lenaa (''aap mahaan hai'') or kisi ke saath tadatmya kii anubhuti (''aap mahaan hai lekin main aapkaa ansh hum'')
 In this surrender, a mindset begins to be formed and strengthened, which outweighs any logical or critical attitude towards the Guru
 ek aadhyatmik guru swami muktanand apane ek bhakt ke anubhav ke bare main khud hi likhte hai, ''jab aap guru ke prati khud ko samarpit kar dete hai, to aap kisi ghati, shunya, anant gahare gadde kii tarah ho jate hai
 You get depth, not height
 is samarpan ko kai tarah se anubhav kiya ja saktaa he
 Guru starts appearing in you, his energy starts flowing in you
 '' lekin daanvi karishmai dharmik netaaon yaa shaskaon (hitler, stallin) vaale pashchimi anubhavon ke liye bharatiyon ke is tarah ke samarpan bhav ko pachaa paanaa kathin hoga
 But i understand that both will agree that the attraction of the spiritual master lies in the very beginning and dialogue of life
 kisi vyakti se yah poochna ki vah kisi guru kaa anusaran kyon karata he, yah sawaal karne ke samaan he ki ladkaa apane pita kii topi kyon apane sir par rakhata he yaa koi choti ladki kyon apni maa kii chappal pahanakar chalane kii koshish karti he

 At present, the big leaders of both countries are also emphasizing the need for talks by dismissing the fear of war
 gauratlab he ki donon deshon ke bich 20 saal pehle hui sandhi ke tahat ek-duusare ko parmaanu thikaanon kii suchi saunpi jaaegi, taaki bhulvash koi badi durghatana na ho jaae
 The agreement was signed during the prime minister's tenure of Benazir Bhutto
 paris ko khun ke aansu rulaane vaale aatankwaadi sanghathan iesas or uske sargana bagdadi se ladane vaale desh aapas main hi ladane lage hai
 First Turkey flew Russian fighter aircraft
 phir rus ne bhayankar anjaam kii dhamkee di to turki kii peeth par haath rakhkar america khadaa ho gaya
 Now the question is whether the countries fighting Baghdadi are telling the world about the Third World War
 jab europe kii taraf bagdadi ke khooni panje bade to laga ki duniya ekajute hokar uske aatank kaa safaya karegi
 Bombing from Russia to Paris and Britain to the US started bombing every location of Baghdadi from Syria to Iraq
 kahin rakka main france ke missile gole barasaane lage
 Elsewhere, Russian fighter aircraft began to selectively destroy ISIS terrorist targets
 laga ab bagdadi ke din lad gaye
 a few days ago, in Turkey, the G-20 countries, who joined hands together and vowed to wipe out the terror of Baghdadi, were shattered in ten days
 america or rus ek duusare ke khilaaf tanakar khadey ho gaye
 On Tuesday, a Turkish military was killed by the Turkish military in Syria
 iesas ke khilaaf apane mishan main ai is rukaawat se rus baukhala gaya
 The President of Russia called it a hoax
 america-rus ke bich bagdadi ko rahatpichley das dinon se bagdadi jindagi ke sabase mushkil din dekh rahaa tha, lekin duniya banty to usase bagdadi ko raahat kii saans mili hogi
 After this attack, on one side is Russia, with which countries like Syria and Iraq are against Baghdadi, but also against America
 duusari taraf america he, jiske saath turki he, britain he or france bhi
 Now the question is whether America and Russia will miss the fight against terror
 ladaai ke vakt badale america ke tevaryaad dilaate chalem ki turki ke hi antalya shahar main ji-20 kii baithak main roosi raashtrapati bladimir putin ne ek bada sansanikhej khulaasa kiya tha
 Putin accused many countries of the G-20 to help Baghdadi
 ab bagdadi se ladaai karte vakt jis tarah america ke tevar badale hai
 Turkey stands against Russia, raising questions about whether the world is moving towards world war
 adward snanoden ne kiya tha khulhasadrasal america syria main aisi sarkaar chahta he jo uske ishaare par naachati rahe
 His fight against Baghdadi also comes under suspicion that his role is believed in raising Baghdadi

 iskaa makasad israel ke aas-paas vaale deshon main aatankwaad kii aisi takat khadi karnaa tha, jisamen israel virdohi desh ulajhakar rah jaaen, or israel surakshit rahe
 Israel itself gave Baghdadi training in arms throughout the year
 obama sang aatank ke khilaaf franceis bich bagdadi kaa taaja kahar jhelane vaala france america or rus ke bich jhul rahaa he
 By the way, the American visit of French President François Hollande tells that he wants to fight against terror only with Obama
 lekin oland ko bhi ye gavaara nahin ki wo jameen par utarkar syria main bagdadi ke aatankiyon se laden
 Therefore, the path will be the same as Russia is adopting
