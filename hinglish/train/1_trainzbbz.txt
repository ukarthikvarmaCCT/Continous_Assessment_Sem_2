 supreme court main kai aitihaasik faislon ko dene vaale purv chif justise aaram lodha
 The decision on IPL fixing has also been historic in many ways, it is clear that in this case, Justice Lodha was chosen by the Supreme Court bench for this
 supreme court cover karte karte do saal mujhe bhi ho gaye hai, lekin is tarah itane bade mudde par itnaa bada faisla pehali baar camaron main live sunaaya gaya
 Justice Lodha along with his team reached India Habitat Center at twelve o'clock for one o'clock time
 iske baad wo 1 bajane se kuch der pehle silver ok 2 haul main pahunche
 Media cameras surrounded them all around
 jor-jor se awaajen aane lagi
 However, Justice Lodha made it clear that he needed peace
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki ek baj gaya he ab faisle kaa vakt he
 After that he started narrating his decision and all the channels also broadcast it live
 aamtaur par jab supreme court main is taraha kaa faisla aata he to halaat alag hote hai
 Mobile phones are not allowed in the court, so all journalists hear the decision of the judge inside
 note karte hai
 After this, everyone comes out and sends the decision to their office
 kai baar jaj itnaa dhimaa bolte hai ki sara faisla sahi se sunai nahin detaa
 In such a situation, one has to inquire from here and there
 lekin, yahaan aisa kuch nahin tha
 In Justice Mike Lodha read the entire Judgment
 ek ek shabd bolaa jo camaron ke jariye sidhe janata tak pahunch gaya
 There is no confusion anywhere
 supreme court kii tarah hi justise lodha, justise ashok bhaan or justise ravindran ne is par sin kiye
 Later, its copy was handed over to the lawyers

 He also told what he was going to do next
 kisi or faisle main kai baar newsroom se kol aati thi
 Answers to some questions were sought
 lekin, is baar aisa nahin hua
 The comments justise lodha bolte rahe or braking news chalati rahi
 Although, earlier he denied the presence of cameras in this judgment, but later he agreed
 haalanki, ye haul kaaphi chota tha lekin, baad main media kii bheed ko dekhte hue haul kaa doosraa hissaa bhi khol diya gaya
 Another interesting incident also happened here
 haul ke baahar hi khaane kaa intjaam tha
 Had coffee and also kept bottles of mineral water
 sabhi ko laga panel pehle faisla sunayega or iske baad lunch karaayega
 Mediamen also drank water from bottles of hand-held mineral water
 kareeb 100 se zyada bottlen khaali kar di
 Justice Lodha came with his panel and pronounced the Judgment and then left
 kai logon ne sochaa ab lunch kholaa jayega
 However, it did not happen even for two hours
 baad main pataa chalaa ki vahiin par koi or kaarykram chal rahaa tha or ye lunch uskaa tha
 The hall is usually empty after the program, but the media persons here remained frozen for three hours
 abhi ye yahi khatm nahin hua, kyonki justise lodha ne kaha he, aage kii karrwai chal rahi he, kuch vakt ke baad phir milenge

 Usually, when the Supreme Court's decision comes, the situation is different
 court main mobile phone le jane kii anumati nahin hoti, lihaaja sab patrkaar bheetar jaj kaa faisla sunate hai
 Let's note
 iske baad baahar aakar sab apane aphis main faisle ko bhejte hai
 Sometimes the judges speak so slowly that the whole verdict is not heard properly

 But, there was nothing like this here

 Every one spoke a word that reached the public directly through cameras
 kahin koi confayujan nahin
 Just like the Supreme Court, Justice Lodha, Justice Ashok Bhan and Justice Ravindran signed it
 baad main isaki copy vakeelon ko saunp di
 He even answered media questions later
 ye bhi bataaya ki aage wo kya karne vaale hai
 In some other decisions, there were calls from the newsroom several times
 kuch sawaalon ke jawaab maange jate the
 But, this time it did not happen
 tippaniyan Justice Lodha kept speaking and breaking news continued
 haalanki, pehle unhone is jajment main camaron kii maujuudagi se inkaar kiya tha, lekin baad main wo taiyaar ho gaye the
 However, this hall was quite small but, due to the media crowd, the second part of the hall was also opened
 yahaan ek or dilachasp ghatana bhi hui
 There was a meal outside the hall itself
 coffee thi or mineral water kii bottlen bhi rakhi thi
 Everyone felt that the panel would give the verdict first and then have lunch
 lage haath mineral water kii botalon se mediakarmiyon ne pani bhi piya
 Emptied more than 100 bottles
 justise lodha apane panel ke saath aae or jajment sunaaya phir chale gaye
 Many thought that lunch would now be opened
 lekin, do ghante tak bhi aisa nahin hua
 Later it was discovered that there was another program going on there and it was his lunch
 aamtaur par kaarykram ke baad haul khaali ho jaataa he, lekin yahaan media ke log teen ghante tak jame rahe
 This is not over yet, because Justice Lodha has said, further action is going on, we will meet again after some time

 raaj kapur ek aisa naam jinhone hindi cinema ko ek alag pahchaan di
 The life of the late actor-director Raj Kapoor, known as the 'show man' of Bollywood, has had many ups and downs
 raaj kapur ne jis parivaar main janm liya, uskaa bollywood main bada naam tha, lekin ek sach yah bhi he ki raaj kapur ne apane kariyar main jin oonchaaiyon ko chuaa, uske peeche sirf unki mehnat or kaabiliyat thi
 Please tell that Raj Kapoor was born on December 14, 1924 in Peshawar (pakistan)
 production company main kiya spotboy kaa kamraj kapur ne 17 saal kii umr main 'ranjit moviekom' or 'bombai tokies' film production company menspotboy kaa kaam shuru kiya
 Even after being born to a person like Prithvi Raj Kapoor, Raj Kapoor fought hard in Bollywood
 unke liye shuruyaat itani aasaan nahin rahi thi
 You will be surprised to know that Raj Kapoor's film career started with a chante
 
 
 
 When Raj Kapoor had to work as a 'clapper boy' in a film by the director Kedar Sharma, Raj Kapoor once clapped so loud that the hero's fake beard came out stuck in the clap
 is par kedaar sharma ne gusse main aakar raaj kapur ko joardaar chaanta raseed kar diya tha
 Later, Kedar took Raj Kapoor as a hero in his film 'neelkamal'
 raaj kapur ne abhinay kaa safar prithviraj theatre ke manch se hi shuru kiya tha

 Witnessing the everlasting flow of Indian culture from time immemorial to Ganga, the next phase of Namami Gange, a program of uninterrupted serene and continuous flow, will now be in the form of Uma Bharti's Ganga shores
 ek taraf sarkaar, enjio or janata milakar ganga safai or ganga ke kayakalp kaa kaam karenge to duusari ore jal sansaadhan or ganga punerjeevan mantri uma bharti do saal tak har saptaah do yaa teen din gomukh se gangasagar ke bich ganga kinare padayatra karengi
 Bharti says that by measuring this step by step, the difficulties of Voganga and Gangaputras will be easily understood
 tab sthaayee upaay karnaa zyada sambhav hoga
 So that in 2018, we can achieve the goal of making Ganga clean, clean and uninterrupted again
 sankalp saakaar ho sake
 That is, if an act is made for this, then according to the wishes of the people
 khaskar ganga kinare rahane vaale logon kii ichha ke mutabik kyonki wo ganga ko sabase zyada sabase behatar samajhate hai or samvedansheel bhi hai
 Uma Bharati said that she and her ministry are not against building a power project on the Ganges, Yamuna and other rivers
 haa, dizin ko lekar hamaara aagrah he
 The design of the dam and the barrage should be such that it does not affect the river's avidity and cleanliness
 naa hi jaev vividhta ko koi khatra ho
 Rivers should be better managed in the plains
 jaise nadiyon ke kinare nadya taal banane kii puraani parampara bharat main rahi he
 So that the waste does not go directly into the river
 ganga ke tatavarti gaanvon main jaivik kheti ho, jaanwaron ke prajnan or nasl sudhaar ke santhaan banaaye jane chaiye
 Afforestation is also necessary
 kyonki iske bagaiyr ganga to kya kisi bhi nadi kaa prakritik pravaah or swaroop lautaaya nahin ja saktaa
 The biggest revolution is going to come that the government will now sell the PSU institutions by treating drains and sewer water
 iske liye narora main antipisi, banaras main railway kaarkaana, mathura main indian oil rifinary jaise bade sansthaanon se emoyu taiyaar kiye jaaenge
 Soon it will be talked to private industrial houses to buy treated water and use it in their factories
 isse nadi kaa jivan bachegaa saath hi pani kaa phir phir istemaal bhi hoga
 The conference of 1650 panchayats will be held next month
 The Water Resources Minister said that the government had to spend all the money it had to spend
 abapariyojnaonmen jab tak gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon, yani enjio or aam janata kii bhagidaari nahin hogi tab tak lakshya kii prapti sthaayee nahin hogi
 It is important to know the attitude of the public
 taaki ye pataa to chale ki ganga se chhedchhad kaise band ho
 How much and what is the punishment
 lihaaja paanch rajyon main ganga kinare based 6000 gaanvon kii 1650 panchayaton ke sarpanchon kaa sammelan agle maheene elahabaad main hoga
 It will also discuss the outline of the Act that ensures the cleanliness of the Ganges and other rivers
 taaki pariyojna kaa swaroop or ection plan janata or panchayatein tay karen naa kii afasar
 In this connection, on August 26, Ganga Panchayat will be in four places in the villages situated on both sides of the Ganges in Varanasi
 ganga kinare based shaharon main das ganga smart city bhi tay kii jaaengi taaki swasth pratiyogita ho or isi bahaane janata main jaagarukta or shaharon main smart banane kii hode to ho
 Meanwhile, Neeri is also going to give his report in which it has been studied that when the quality of Ganga water from Gomukh to Gangasagar is changing when and where and how it is changing
 or isaki vajah kya he
 This will also make it easier to solve according to the problems
 chunki samasyaayein har jagah alag alag kism kii hai
 Somewhere industrial
 kahin shahar kaa kachra he
 Somewhere the amount of arsenic in the ground is high, and there is a glut of chemicals
 iske liye shahar vikaas mantralay
 Co-ordination is also necessary between the policies and officials of the eight ministries, including the Ministry of Rural Development, the Ministry of Energy and the Ministry of Chemicals, along with the Ministry of Forest and Environment
 aise main ganga punerjeevan mantralay isamen madhyasth kii bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he
 Real time monitors are being installed in CM offices
 Now when it comes to afforestation along the Ganges, the general public should plant and take care of their ancestors on memorable days and dates with their nampattika
 companiyaan or audyogic gharaane apni nampattiyon ke saath ganga or anya nadiyon ke kinaaron kaa saundaryikaran karen saath hi sthaayee dekhbhaal bhi
 The government will provide them facilities but the expenditure and maintenance should be done by ngos, industrial houses or the general public themselves
 philhal to paanchon rajyon ke mukhya mantriyon or mukhya sachivon ke daftar main real time monitor lagaae ja rahe hai jisamen ganga or pramukh nadiyon main pradooshan ke aankade aate rahenge
 The expenditure and income of the 2200 crore rupees project Manjurganga revival programs is now going on
 to iske liye uma bharti ne kaha ki sieji hamaari yojanaon kaa lagaataar audit kare
 The CAG can ask for any detail from us whenever
 ham khushi khushi muhaiyaa karaayenge
 Because the government has approved a plan of Rs 2200 crore for maintaining biodiversity in the Ganges
 kanpur ke seesamu naale ko sudhaarney ke liye 63 karod, netwarking ke liye 397 karod, bithur main ganga tat saundaryikaran ke liye 100 karod rupee aavantit kiye gaye hai
 That is, a total of 20 thousand crore rupees, including 99 ongoing projects for Ganga revival
 lihaaja nigaraanee to jaruri he
 Uma Bharti said that among those who expressed a desire to contribute to the implementation of these schemes, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, Swami Ramdev, Imam of Gyanvapi in Kashi, Jathedar of Patna Sahib, many retired officers, students of school colleges on leave are eager to contribute Huh
 trited water ke prabandhan ko lekarr emoyu sin hongesarkari kaam bhi aage bad rahe hai
 mous will be signed for the management of treated water in Mathura on 17 August, Kanpur on 19 August, Varanasi and Allahabad on 20 August
 yani pichley do saalon se in kaaryakramon kii ghoshnaa ho rahi he
 Now they are coming to the surface
 lakshya 2018 he
 Because there are also general elections in 2019
 ab pehle ganga saaf hoti he yaa niti, niyat yaa phir nirnay

 It will face down the common people and will try to solve their problems there

 supreme court ne saaf kaha ki is maamle main koi jaanch nahin hogi, cese main koi aadhaar nahin he
 The Supreme Court said that there is no reason to doubt the statement of the four judges
 unke bayaan par andeh karnaa santhaan par andeh karnaa jaisaa hoga
 The court said that an attempt is being made to defame the judiciary through the case
 congress netaa tahseen poonawala, patrkaar bies lone, bambe loyrs association sahit anya kai pakshakaron kii ore se daayar visheshjaj biech loyaki maut kii nishpaksh jaanch kii maang vaali yachikaaon par chif justise deepak mishra kii adhyakshata vaali teen jajon kii peeth ne faisla sunaaya
 Earlier, during the hearing of the much-discussed and controversial case, senior counsel and former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, on behalf of the Maharashtra government, had argued that the petitioners only want to give light to the matter
 yachikakarta yah sandesh failaane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki jaj, police, doctor sahit sabhi kii mileebhagat rahi
 Rohatgi said that this is a fatal trend, so it should be stopped
 jajon ko sangrakshan dena bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish kaa kartavya he or unke dwaara yah sunishchit kiya janaa chahie ki kanoon kaa shashan chalata rahe
 Rohatgi called the reports raising suspicion about Judge Loya's death as false
 unhone court se kaha ki yachikaaon main betukepan kii seemaa laangh di gai he
 One petitioner says that the role of four other judges who had joined Judge Loya in the wedding ceremony of a fellow judge's family is questionable
 rohtagi ne kaha, ek yachikakarta to kahata he ki vah in jajon se sawaal-jawaab karnaa chahta he
 Someone says that contempt action should be taken against the Administrative Committee of the Bombay High Court
 yachikakartaon kaa yah kahana he ki jaanch teen dinon main kaise puri hui? jaj loya ko usee aspataal main kyon le jaaya gaya, duusare main kyon nahin? unhen auto se aspataal le jaaya gaya
 Whereas the truth is that he was taken to the hospital by a fellow judge's car
 yachikakarta managasaint kahaniyaan rach rahe hai
 What's the matter? Judge Loya, who was hearing a politically sensitive Sohrabuddin encounter case, was killed in 2014
 yachikaaon main jaj loya kii maut kenishpaksh jaanch karaane kiguhaar kii gai he
 The issue came to light in November last year when a media report said that Judge Loya's sister had raised questions about the brother's death

 police mukhyalay dwaara argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ko pradaan house gards ko waapas bulaane ke baad uthe vivaad ko lekar ab ek nayaa khulaasa hua he
 Former Chief Minister Rabri Devi and her two sons Tej Pratap and Tejashwi Yadav have been on fire ever since Lalu's return to safety
 apni naaraazgi vyakt karne ke liye teenon ne buudhvaar ko unhen sarkaar dwaara pradaan surakshakarmiyon ko waapas bhej diya or kaha ki unki sevaayen unhen nahin chahie
 However, on Wednesday evening, the Police Headquarters at a press conference revealed how meaningless it was to create controversy about the lack of security by Laloo and Family
 police mukhyalay ke ediji esake singhl ne sabase pehle is baat ko lekar spashtikaran diya ki suraksha main kami keval lalu prasad yadav kii gai he na ki rabari devi or unke beton kii
 ADG Singhal said that due to being in jail, Lalu Prasad Yadav no longer lives at 10, Circular Road residence, hence the security provided to him by the police headquarters has been withdrawn, which is 15
 singhl ne bataaya ki lalu ko pradaan bihar military police ke 3 hawaldaar or 12 sipaahiyon ko waapas bula liya gaya he
 However, despite being in jail, Lalu still has three Bihar Police officers and 10 Commandos of the Central Reserve Police Force, 10, in the Circular Road residence due to the z plus security provided by the Central Government
 lalu kii suraksha par spashtikaran dene ke baad ediji singhl ne rabari devi, tej pratap ortejaswiki suraksha ko lekar khulaasa shuru kiya
 The ADG told how till yesterday more than 100 Bihar Police personnel were posted 24 hours under the protection of Lalu and Family, but now it has decreased slightly after Lalu's security was withdrawn
 sabase pehle baat purvamukhyamantri rabari deviki
 The ADG said that Rabri Devi is authorized under the z Plus category and Special Security Group Act 2010 Act with 36 security personnel including bodyguards, pilots, escorts, house guards, policemen for surveillance, policemen for investigation, bullet-proof cars, but currently they have 56 Are security personnel
 ab baat netaa pratipaksh tejasvi yadav kii
 As the leader of opposition, Tejashwi Yadav is authorized to hold 17 security personnel, consisting of 7 bodyguards and 10 house guards, but presently Tejashwi has a total of 27 security personnel
 ab baat purv swasthya mantri or lalu ke bade bete tej pratap yadav kii
 Tej Pratap is now only an MLA and as an MLA he is authorized to have only 3 bodyguards but currently he has 10 security personnel
 vartmaan main agar rabari devi (56), tejasvi yadav (27), tej pratap yadav (10) or lalu yadav ke paas bache surakshakarmiyon (13) ko jod diya jaae to lalu kii gairmaujuudagi main unki patni or donon bete kii suraksha main ab bhi 106 surakshakarmi tainaat hai
 But despite so much security, Rabri Devi and her two sons are crying foul about the lack of security and are accusing Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of plotting to get her killed
 samaajawaadee party ke netaa, mulaayam ke kareebi or akhilesh sarkaar main mantri rahe ambika choudhary ne shanivaar ko bahujan samaaj party (basapa) kaa daaman tham liya
 Chaudhary was given membership of the party by BSP chief Mayawati during a press conference
 wo apni paaramparik vidhansabha seat baliya ke fefna se hi chunaav ladenge
 He lost this seat in 2012 and was later made a member of the Legislative Council by the SP
 darasal, ambika choudhary mulaayam ke qareebi maane jate the
 In recent times, he was always standing with Mulayam during internal squabbles in SP
 mayawati ne kaha, 'maine inhen (choudhary ko) party main liya he or unhen yahaan sapa se zyada aadar-sammaan diya jayega
 Also, he will be contesting the assembly elections from his old seat in Ballia district '
 ambika choudhary ne kaha, 'maine sapa kii praathmik sadsyta or usase sambandhit sabhi padon se istipha de diya he
 i fully dedicate myself to the direction the party and Behenji (mayawati) will have in the politics ahead with the BSP '
 tippaniyan Chaudhary said, "what Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav did to his father Mulayam Singh Yadav in the last two months was not good
 vahaan yah sab nautanki ke peeche kaa uddeshy hi kuch or tha
 We are joining the BSP to prevent communal forces from coming to power in UP in 2017
 " He said that he was close to both Mulayam and Shivpal Yadav, but what happened in the Samajwadi Party was not good
 samaajawaadee apni raah se bhatak gaye hai
 Pointing to Akhilesh, Chaudhary said that when a son treats his father like this, then what is left to say after this? choudhary ko ek samvaadadaata sammelan ke dauraan basapa pramukh mayawati ne party kii sadsyta dilaai
 He will contest from his traditional assembly seat Ballia's Fafna
 is seat par haalanki vah 2012 main haar gaye the or baad main sapa ne unhen vidhaan parishad sadsy banaaya tha
 Actually, Ambika Chaudhary was considered close to Mulayam
 haal ke dinon main sapa main andruni kalah ke dauraan wo hameshaa mulaayam ke saath khadey dikhe the
 Mayawati said, 'I have taken him (chaudhary) into the party and he will be given more respect than SP here
 saath hi unhen baliya jile kii unki puraani seat se hi vidhansabha chunaav ladaaya jayega'
 Ambika Chaudhary said, 'I have resigned from the primary membership of SP and all the posts related to it
 main puri tarah samarpit hokar basapa ke saath aage kii raajnneeti main, jo disha-nirdesh party or bahanji (mayawati) kaa hoga, uske liye khud ko samarpit karata hum'
 The comments choudhary ne kaha, "mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne apane pita mulaayam singh yadav ke saath pichley do maheene main jo kiya vah acha nahin tha
 There the purpose behind all this gimmick was something else
 ham basapa main shaamil ho rahe hai, taaki upra main 2017 main sampradayik shaktiyon ko satta main aane se roka ja sake
 " unhone kaha ki vah mulaayam or shivpal yadav donon ke kareeb the, lekin samaajawaadee party main jo kuch hua, vah acha nahin tha
 Socialists have lost their way
 akhilesh kii ore ishaara karte hue choudhary ne kaha ki jab ek betaa apane pita ke saath is tarah kaa bartaav karata he to iske baad or kuch kehane ko kya bachataa he? Actually, Ambika Chaudhary was considered close to Mulayam
 haal ke dinon main sapa main andruni kalah ke dauraan wo hameshaa mulaayam ke saath khadey dikhe the

 At the same time, another family has died

 However, the spokesperson did not give further details of any case
 input - bhashaa As the noise of the assembly elections in Uttarakhand intensified, political parties have started worrying about the Dalit and Muslim total 30 per cent votes
 bhale hi daliton or muslimon ke mudde abhi rajnatik sawaal nahin ban paae hai, lekin unke vot ko lapakane kii bechaini sabhi dalon main saaf-dikhaai detii he
 The BJP and the Congress have also organized Dalit Sammelan at many places to woo the Dalit votes
 isi saal bhaajapa ne muslimon kaa rashtriya sammelan dehradun main yojit kar unhen apane paale main khinchne kii bhi koshish kii
 National General Secretary of the Congress, Chaudhary Virendra Singh, has even announced the appointment of a Dalit as the Chief Minister
 isse utsahit dalit congress ke saath dikh rahe hai
 There is also a ray of hope among the Dalits that the Congress has handed over the command in the hands of Yashpal Arya as the party president
 arya kii aguai main congress rajya kii paanchon loksabhaa siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 Dalit voters in the state are traditionally associated with the Congress
 lekin mudda yah he ki aaj tak bhaajapa or congress donon hi dalit muddon kii padtaal nahin kar pai hai
 When it comes to power, Dalits are always marginalized
 asann vidhansabha chunaav main rajya vidhansabha kii 15 siten arakshit hai, jinamein 13 siten anusuchit jati or 2 anusuchit janajatiyon ke liye hai
 The irony is that the key to the state's power has always been in the hands of the people, with whom the public representatives associated with the most reserved seats come
 abhi se pehle kii sarkaar main daliton kii arakshit siton se 6 congressi jite the or rajya main congress kii sarkaar bani
 Similarly, this time 6 BJP leaders came from winning seats reserved for Dalits and now BJP is running the government in the state
 congress ke anusuchit jati prakoshth ke pradesh adhyaksh dow
 Jitaram says that the Dalits have not yet got the importance in the state as they are entitled to
 lekin congress kii dalit reliyon main umada jansailab is baat kaa sanket he ki unki aasthaa congress ke saath he
 Jitaram raises the question whether the Congress will hand over power of the state to any Dalit as promised? This will become a mandatory condition for him to be associated with this party
 rajya kii surakshit ghoshit kii gai siton ke alaava bhi rajya kii aadha darjan se adhik siton par dalit hi nirnaayak sthiti main hai
 Congress state secretary Sumer Chand Ravi says that Dalit voters are in a decisive position in the 22 seats in the state
 aise main arakshit siton ke alaava partiyon ko saamaanya siton par bhi daliton ko tikat dena chahie
 But the reality is that no party wants to field Dalit candidates from the seats other than reserved seats
 phir vah pratyaashee kitna hi padhaa-likhaa yaa phir bade pad par kyon na rah chukaa ho
 Arya, a speaker of the state assembly, who is also the state president of the Congress, is forced to go to the ground to contest elections from a safe seat due to the end of Mukteshwar assembly seat
 jabaki ve itnaa janaadhar rakhte hai ki saamaanya seat se ladakar chunaav jeet sakate hai
 Even a cabinet minister of the state is facing the same situation
 arakshit seat dhanolti se jitkar aae khajaan das ko bhaajapa vartmaan main us seat ke saamaanya hone ke baad vahaan se tikat nahin de rahi
 Khajan Das wants to contest the upcoming elections from the reserved Rajpur seat of Dehradun
 dalit chintak mahesh chandra donia ke anusaar, ''aarakshan ke khilaaf shuru hue pruthak uttarakhand rajya andolan ke baad astitv main aane vaale is rajya ke dalit congress se yahi ummid lagaae baithe hai ki shaayad is baar congress is rajnatik bhul ko durust kare
 The Uttarakhand Samata Andolan has prepared a Dalit manifesto for the first time
 samta andolan ke sanyojak prem pancholi kaa kahana he ki daliton kaa mandiron main pravesh, daliton ke saath badhati hinsa, aarakshan ke baavjood 15,000 se adhik padon kaa khaali hona jaise anek mudde is ghoshnaa patr main shaamil kiye gaye hai
 Like the Dalits, 12 percent of the state's Muslims are also victims of political neglect
 do aam chunaavon ke baavjood muslimon ke prati partiyon kaa ravaiya nahin badla he
 However, in the last election in the state assembly four Muslim mlas were elected
 basapa rajya vidhanmandal dal ke netaa ke rup main muslim vidhayak ko vidhansabha main kaman bhi mili, phir bhi muslim pratinidhi ko rajya main abhi tak mantri banane kaa mauka nahin mila he
 Be it BJP or Congress, no one has appointed a representative of this minority community to a ministerial position
 haalanki congress ke narayan dutt tiwari shasankaal main alpsankhyakon ke vikaas kii tamaam yojanaayen shuru jarur huin, lekin congress se koi alpsankhyak vidhayak chunakar na aane ke kaaran mantri nahin ban sakaa

 The parties are eyeing the votes of the minorities, but the status of giving them tickets is not clear

 According to Mashroor Ahmed Khan 'guddu', who is associated with the Congress in Nainital, a Muslim plays a decisive role in bringing power to the Congress, but the same Congress does not give him a ticket

 ” a hearing was held in the Supreme Court on Wednesday about the raising of funds through electoral bonds and transparency of funding of political parties
 centre sarkaar ke rukh kaa virodh karte hue, chunaav ayog (EC) ne supreme court ko bataaya he ki elactoral bond kii yojana raajnneetik funding main paardarshita ko prabhavit karegi
 During the hearing, the Election Commission informed the Supreme Court that it has written a letter to the Center saying that changes in several laws related to political donations will have serious consequences on transparency
 ayeg ne kaha ki epasiare 2010 kanoon main badlaav se raajnneetik dal bina jaanch vaala videshi chanda praapt karenge jisase bhartiya nitiyaan videshi companiyon se prabhavit ho sakati hai
 The Election Commission, which filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court, said that on 26 May 2017, in a letter to the Ministry of Law and Justice, it had conveyed its view that changes in income tax law, public representation law and finance law were against transparency in funding to political parties Will be halafname main kaha gaya he ki kanoon evam nyaay mantralay ko suchit kiya gaya he ki aisi sthiti main elactoral bond ke madhyam se praapt dhan ko report nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, it will be difficult to get information whether the law has been violated under Section 29B of the Representation of People Act
 is dhara ke tahat sarkaar company yaa videshi strot se raajnneetik partiyaan dhan praapt nahin kar sakati hai
 Explain that to improve the electoral funding system, the government introduced electoral bonds last year
 sarkaar ne is daawey ke saath is bond kii shuruyaat kii thi ki isse raajnneetik funding main paardarshita badhegi or saaf-suthra dhan aayega
 But what happened is the opposite
 is bond ne paardarshita laane kii jagah jokhim or badha diya he, yahi nahin videshi sroton se bhi chanda aane kii gunjaaish ho gai he
 When Bollywood actor Harman Baweja came into the industry, during that time he made a good fan following in a short time
 harman kii tulana us samay ruthik roshan jaise actors se kii jaati thi
 Also there were reports of his affair with Priyanka Chopra
 magar harman ko donon hi front par niraashaa haath lagi
 While his films did not perform well at the box office, on the other hand, his relationship with Priyanka also did not progress for a very long time
 harman kaa janm 13 november, 1980 ko chandigarh main hua tha
 Harman had told in an interview why his and Priyanka's relationship could not go on
 harman or priyanka kii dosti 2008 main film 'lav story 2050' se shuru hui thi
 At that time Harman was also new to the industry
 donon kii dosti pyaar main to badal gai, lekin inaki agali film 'wats yor raashi' ke relies se pehle hi inkaa relation tut gaya
 The relationship lasted less than two years
 harman ek intervyuu main bataaya tha ki ve or priyanka kyon alag hue
 Harman told that he did not have time for Priyanka
 unki do filmein pehle hi flop ho gai thim, isliye un par pressure bad gaya tha
 He was focusing on his third film
 'wats yor raashi' mere liye kaaphi ahm thi
 Director Ashutosh Gowariker instructed him not to place anyone in his personal space
 harman ne kaha kipriyankownase time dene ke liye kahati rahati thim
 But they could not do so
 is kaaran donon ke rishton main khatas aa gai or alag-alag ho gaye
 Did Priyanka break her relationship with Harman? In some reports, it is also said that Priyanka had broken the relationship with Harman, because he could not establish himself as a successful actor
 harman in khabaron ko khaarij karte hue kaha tha "main in afvaahon main bharosa nahin karata
 Only two humans in love can know what went wrong between them
 mujhe nahin lagata ki kisi kii safalataa yaa asafalataa se relationships main koi badlaav aata he

 is baat kii sateek bhavishyavaanee kar dene kaa junun chunaav ladane waalon se zyada khatarnaak hota he
 Telling who will win can make you a hero in the world of undiscovered people
 chunaav ke dauraan ham jaison ke paas khub phone aate hai
 Tell me who will win? feel what? Who is saying If it is not there, the fun of the election goes away
 kai baar main khud ko alag kar letaa hum, lekin kai baar jigyaasa ke is janjaal main khud ko funsane se nahin roak paata
 What you want, what is happening, who is going to see and what will happen, any election prediction should be tested on the basis of these four things
 bihar kii bhavishyavaanee ko lekar log do khemon main bant gaye hai
 One wants you to say that if the BJP loses, it becomes happy
 doosraa sirf yah sunanaa chahta he ki bijepi jite
 Many times the people of these two camps become sympathetic after seeing the tension on their faces
 lagata he ki agar kah diya ki aap jo chaahate hai wo nahin hoga to kahin ye khaanaa-pinaa na chhod den
 There is no harm in telling lies through age and weak heart! ek teesraa khemaa hota he, jo in chaahane waalon se zyada ugr hota he
 He not only wants the BJP or Nitish to lose, but also wants that once the party of my mind wins, i can bully the supporters of the loser
 unhen chidhaa sakuun
 i can dance in front of them
 inkaa jeet ke vakt kii vinamrata se koi lenaa-dena nahin hota
 Suppose the BJP wins, then this section will call those people, strike them and write the article and remove the frustration
 thik isi tarah se nitish ke jeetne par karegaa
 There are some people who are scared to hear the news of the result according to their mind
 abhi mat bolo
 Only eight will be seen
 maine to finger cross kar liya he
 We will not celebrate now
 pichhali baar aisa hi kiya tha, lekin wo party to haar gai
 Suddenly he starts behaving like a superstitious
 bahut log aise bhi hote hai, jo yah sochakar kisi ke haarane jeetne kii afvaah failaane lagate ki isse haarane vaala or haaregaa yaa haarane vaala jeetne lagegaa yaa jeetne vaala or jitegaa
 Journalists are also involved in this game
 donon taraf se 'vaicharik perol' par patrkaar aisa kar rahe hai
 If you are a journalist and are predicting someone to win, then you have to take the risk of being seen from this point of view
 yah ek sachai he
 Media sharing has been completed
 aisa nahin ki modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad hi hua he, balki pehle se hi hota aayaa he
 The corporate has further promoted this partnership of journalists
 aap bas yahi karte hai ki ek ko virdohi ghoshit kar duusare ko dekhne lagate hai
 While the one who is watching is also said to be a great supporter of someone
 media ko samarthak or virdohi ghoshit karne kaa ek fishan-sa bhi chal padaa he
 Many viewers also want to watch the news according to their political allegiance
 santulan kii maang or samaj main kaaphi antar dikhataa he
 However, who is whose supporter is not important
 mahatvapurn yah he ki sab is hamaam main nange hai
 Healing himself and calling others naked
 jo log kahin nahin hai, jo dekh rahe hai vahi bol rahe hai unki bhi shamat aane vaali he
 Who will win in Bihar, will the loser win or will the winner lose the news of this claim? There should be research on this
 chunaav shuru hone se pehle jeetne ke daawey hote hai or nattejey kii purv sandhya tak hote rahete hai
 There is such a percentage in the voters who vote after hearing who is winning
 wo apana vot karaab nahin karnaa chahta
 It is also a kind of cunning and clever category among the voters, which is nothing more than the cunning of being with the victorious side
 par kuch to he ki raajnneetik dal bhi ham jeetenge ke prachaar prasar par kaaphi jor dete hai 
 The comments bihar main koun jitegaa yah ek jokhim kaa kaam he
 No one has a strong scale to tell
 bhavishyavaanee karne vaale par bhi kam dabaav nahin he
 He wants to be proved right
 galat hone se uski saakh kharaab ho sakati he
 i keep calling different types of people throughout the day
 un sabhi se alag-alag tarah ke logon ko phone kar feedback dene ke liye kahata hum
 Then call another journalist
 uski bhavishyavaanee se apni bhavishyavaanee milaataa hum
 Many a times it is learned that both are talking to a source and putting their trade mark on the prediction and putting them in the market! The source you asked is doing the same thing
 isliye haar jeet ke bare main bataa dena itnaa aasaan kaam nahin he
 Think carefully, otherwise your friends will taunt you in search of the result that you were saying that the Grand Alliance will win, you were saying that the NDA will win
 lekin jokhim hi nahin liya to jivan kya jiyaa
 You tell me which one of the two will win! aap kya chaahate hai, kya hota dikh rahaa he, dekhne vaala koun he or kya hoga in chaar baton kii kasuti par kisi bhi chunavi bhavishyavaanee ko parkhaa janaa chahie
 People are divided into two camps regarding the prediction of Bihar
 ek chahta he ki aap yah kah den ki bijepi haaregi to vah khush ho jaataa he
 The other just wants to hear that the BJP wins
 kai baar in donon khemon ke logon ke chehre par tanaav dekhakar sahanubhuti ho jaati he
 It seems that if you have said that what you want will not happen, then do not leave this food and drink somewhere
 umr or kamazor dil bhaanp kar jhooth bol dene main koi buraai nahin he! There is a third camp, which is more fierce than these fans
 wo sirf yah nahin chahta ki bijepi yaa nitish haare, balki yah bhi chahta he ki mere man kii party ek baar jeet jaae to haarane vaale ke samarthakon par dhauns jamaa sakuun
 i can tease them
 unke saamne dance kar sakuun
 They have nothing to do with the humility of the time of victory
 maan lijiye bijepi jeet gai to yah tabaka un logon ko phone karegaa, hadakaaegaa or lekh likhakar kuntha nikaalega
 This is exactly what Nitish will do if he wins
 kuch log aise bhi hai, jo apane man ke mutabik nattejey kii khabar sunakar dar jate hai
 Don't speak now aath ko hi dekhenge
 i have crossed the finger
 abhi jashn nahin manaayenge
 Last time i did the same, but that party lost
 achaanak wo kisi andhvishwasi-sa bartaav karne lagata he
 There are many people who start spreading rumors that someone will win or lose, thinking that the loser and loser or loser will start winning or the winner will win more
 is khel main patrkaar bhi shaamil hai
 Journalists are doing this on 'ideological payroll' from both sides
 agar aap patrkaar hai or kisi ke haarane jeetne kii bhavishyavaanee kar rahe hai to is najar se dekhe jane kaa khatra to uthaanaa hi hoga
 This is a fact
 media kaa partykaran puraa ho chukaa he
 It is not that it has happened after the coming of the Modi government, but it has already happened
 corporate ne patrakaron ke is partykaran ko or badhaava diya he
 You just do that by declaring one as the opponent and start looking at the other
 jabaki jise dekh rahe hai vah bhi kisi kaa ghor samarthak bataaya jaataa he
 There is also a fashion to declare the media as pro and anti
 kai darshak bhi apni raajnneetik nishtha ke hisaab se khabar dekhnaa chaahate hai
 There is a considerable difference in demand and understanding of equilibrium
 baharhaal koun kiskaa samarthak he yah mahatvapurn nahin he
 The important thing is that everyone is bare in this hammam
 apane ko changa or duusare ko nanga kah rahe hai
 Those who are not anywhere, who are seeing what they are saying are also coming to their peace
 bihar main koun jitegaa kya is daavedaari kii khabar se haarane vaala jeet jaataa hoga yaa jeetne vaala haar jaataa hoga? is par shodh hona chahie
 There are claims of winning before the election begins and until the eve of the result
 matadaataaon main aisa pratishat to he hi jo yah sunakar vot karata he ki koun jeet rahaa he
 He does not want to spoil his vote
 yah bhi matadaataaon ke bich ek kism kaa baklol or chaalaak category he, jo vijayi paksh ke saath hone kii dhoortta se zyaada kuch nahin
 But there is something that political parties also put a lot of emphasis on propagating that we will win
 tippaniyan Who will win in Bihar is a risky job
 bataane kaa pukhta paimaana kisi ke paas nahin he
 There is no less pressure on the predictor
 wo sahi sabit hona chahta he
 Being wrong can spoil his credibility
 dinabhar alag- alag tarah ke logon ko phone karata rahata hum
 i call all of them to give feedback to different types of people
 phir duusare patrkaar ko phone karata hum
 i mix my prophecy with his prophecy
 kai baar pataa chalata he ki donon ek sorce se baat kar bhavishyavaanee par apana trade mark lagaakar market main thel rahe hai! jis sorce se poocha he wo bhi thik yahi kar rahaa hota he
 Therefore, it is not so easy to tell about victory and defeat
 soch-samaj kar kijiyegaa varanaa nateeja aane par aapke hi dost khoj-khoj kar taane denge ki tum to bol rahe the ki mahagathbandhan jitegaa, tum to bol rahe the ki endie jitegaa
 But if you did not take the risk then what life did you live aap hi bataaiye donon main se koun jitegaa ! There is a third camp, which is more fierce than these fans
 wo sirf yah nahin chahta ki bijepi yaa nitish haare, balki yah bhi chahta he ki mere man kii party ek baar jeet jaae to haarane vaale ke samarthakon par dhauns jamaa sakuun
 i can tease them
 unke saamne dance kar sakuun
 They have nothing to do with the humility of the time of victory
 maan lijiye bijepi jeet gai to yah tabaka un logon ko phone karegaa, hadakaaegaa or lekh likhakar kuntha nikaalega
 This is exactly what Nitish will do if he wins
 kuch log aise bhi hai, jo apane man ke mutabik nattejey kii khabar sunakar dar jate hai
 Don't speak now aath ko hi dekhenge
 i have crossed the finger
 abhi jashn nahin manaayenge
 Last time i did the same, but that party lost
 achaanak wo kisi andhvishwasi-sa bartaav karne lagata he
 There are many people who start spreading rumors that someone will win or lose, thinking that the loser and loser or loser will start winning or the winner will win more
 is khel main patrkaar bhi shaamil hai
 Journalists are doing this on 'ideological payroll' from both sides
 agar aap patrkaar hai or kisi ke haarane jeetne kii bhavishyavaanee kar rahe hai to is najar se dekhe jane kaa khatra to uthaanaa hi hoga
 This is a fact
 media kaa partykaran puraa ho chukaa he
 It is not that it has happened after the coming of the Modi government, but it has already happened
 corporate ne patrakaron ke is partykaran ko or badhaava diya he
 You just do that by declaring one as the opponent and start looking at the other
 jabaki jise dekh rahe hai vah bhi kisi kaa ghor samarthak bataaya jaataa he
 There is also a fashion to declare the media as pro and anti
 kai darshak bhi apni raajnneetik nishtha ke hisaab se khabar dekhnaa chaahate hai
 There is a considerable difference in demand and understanding of equilibrium
 baharhaal koun kiskaa samarthak he yah mahatvapurn nahin he
 The important thing is that everyone is bare in this hammam
 apane ko changa or duusare ko nanga kah rahe hai
 Those who are not anywhere, who are seeing what they are saying are also coming to their peace
 bihar main koun jitegaa kya is daavedaari kii khabar se haarane vaala jeet jaataa hoga yaa jeetne vaala haar jaataa hoga? is par shodh hona chahie
 There are claims of winning before the election begins and until the eve of the result
 matadaataaon main aisa pratishat to he hi jo yah sunakar vot karata he ki koun jeet rahaa he
 He does not want to spoil his vote
 yah bhi matadaataaon ke bich ek kism kaa baklol or chaalaak category he, jo vijayi paksh ke saath hone kii dhoortta se zyaada kuch nahin
 But there is something that political parties also put a lot of emphasis on propagating that we will win
 tippaniyan Who will win in Bihar is a risky job
 bataane kaa pukhta paimaana kisi ke paas nahin he
 There is no less pressure on the predictor
 wo sahi sabit hona chahta he
 Being wrong can spoil his credibility
 dinabhar alag- alag tarah ke logon ko phone karata rahata hum
 i call all of them to give feedback to different types of people
 phir duusare patrkaar ko phone karata hum
 i mix my prophecy with his prophecy
 kai baar pataa chalata he ki donon ek sorce se baat kar bhavishyavaanee par apana trade mark lagaakar market main thel rahe hai! jis sorce se poocha he wo bhi thik yahi kar rahaa hota he

 But if you did not take the risk then what life did you live aap hi bataaiye donon main se koun jitegaa ! There are some people who are scared to hear the news of the result according to their mind
 abhi mat bolo
 Only eight will be seen
 maine to finger cross kar liya he
 We will not celebrate now
 pichhali baar aisa hi kiya tha, lekin wo party to haar gai
 Suddenly he starts behaving like a superstitious
 bahut log aise bhi hote hai, jo yah sochakar kisi ke haarane jeetne kii afvaah failaane lagate ki isse haarane vaala or haaregaa yaa haarane vaala jeetne lagegaa yaa jeetne vaala or jitegaa
 Journalists are also involved in this game
 donon taraf se 'vaicharik perol' par patrkaar aisa kar rahe hai
 If you are a journalist and are predicting someone to win, then you have to take the risk of being seen from this point of view
 yah ek sachai he
 Media sharing has been completed
 aisa nahin ki modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad hi hua he, balki pehle se hi hota aayaa he
 The corporate has further promoted this partnership of journalists
 aap bas yahi karte hai ki ek ko virdohi ghoshit kar duusare ko dekhne lagate hai
 While the one who is watching is also said to be a great supporter of someone
 media ko samarthak or virdohi ghoshit karne kaa ek fishan-sa bhi chal padaa he
 Many viewers also want to watch the news according to their political allegiance
 santulan kii maang or samaj main kaaphi antar dikhataa he
 However, who is whose supporter is not important
 mahatvapurn yah he ki sab is hamaam main nange hai
 Healing himself and calling others naked
 jo log kahin nahin hai, jo dekh rahe hai vahi bol rahe hai unki bhi shamat aane vaali he
 Who will win in Bihar, will the loser win or will the winner lose the news of this claim? There should be research on this
 chunaav shuru hone se pehle jeetne ke daawey hote hai or nattejey kii purv sandhya tak hote rahete hai
 There is such a percentage in the voters who vote after hearing who is winning
 wo apana vot karaab nahin karnaa chahta
 It is also a kind of cunning and clever category among the voters, which is nothing more than the cunning of being with the victorious side
 par kuch to he ki raajnneetik dal bhi ham jeetenge ke prachaar prasar par kaaphi jor dete hai 
 The comments bihar main koun jitegaa yah ek jokhim kaa kaam he
 No one has a strong scale to tell
 bhavishyavaanee karne vaale par bhi kam dabaav nahin he
 He wants to be proved right
 galat hone se uski saakh kharaab ho sakati he
 i keep calling different types of people throughout the day
 un sabhi se alag-alag tarah ke logon ko phone kar feedback dene ke liye kahata hum
 Then call another journalist
 uski bhavishyavaanee se apni bhavishyavaanee milaataa hum

 a post shared by Bollywoodirect (@bollywoodirect) on Jul 31, 2018 at 9:52pm PDT The Mahabharata of Varun Gandhi is seen in Sultanpur, a political stronghold of the Gandhi family
 postaron main rath par savaar hokar varun ne tai sonia or bhai rahul ko lalakaara he
 Varun's charioteer has become history-sheeter Sonu Singh, who has been inducted into the BJP on Wednesday
 shahar main aise hordings laga die gaye hai, jinamein historishiter sonu singh krishna banakar rath haank rahe hai or arjuna bane varun yuddh kar rahe hai
 In fact, Varun Gandhi has rallied Rahul and Sonia by rallying in Sultanpur, the political stronghold of the Gandhi family
 bijepi ke gandhi varun yahaan se chunaav ladenge
 Seeing the hoardings in the rally, why did you call this era Kali Yuga? In the hoardings, you can see that the history sheeter Sonu Singh is chanting the chariot made by Lord Krishna and Varun Gandhi is fighting the war as Arjun
 kya inaki tulana krishna or arjuna se ho sakati he? lekin us or is mahabharat main ek samanta he ki ve bhi apano se lard gaye, ye apano se ladane aae hai
 Yes, the difference is that there was no historyheater with Arjun
 sonu singh ne is maukey par kaha ki aane vaale sansadeey chunaavon main main tan-man-dhan se or puri nishtha se aadarneey varun bhaiya kaa puure se puraa sahyog karuunga or apni donon vidhansabhaon sultanpur or isoli se baari maton se vijayi banane kaa prayaas karuunga
 Sultanpur has been the stronghold of the Gandhi family from the beginning
 ab tak aath baar congress ne yah seat jiti he
 On this occasion, Varun Gandhi said, My father's hand has been in your hand
 aane vaale samay main aapkaa ksht apana ksht samajhakar kaam karne kii koshish karuunga
 The comments sonu singh sultanpuri kii isoli seat se chunaav lade rahe hai
 His history sheet is open in the police station here, according to which his brother Monu Singh Ganglider and he himself are members of the gang
 isse pehle vah sapa, basapa or pis party se chunaav lard chuke hai
 Varun brought Gadkari himself in the battlefield
 is jang main agar vah congress ko haraa dete hai to yah rahul or sonia kii bhi haar hogi, kyonki rahul sultanpur kii amethi or sonia bagal ke jile raibareli se aati hai
 Such hoardings have been installed in the city, in which historyheater Sonu Singh is chanting Krishna as Krishna, and Arjun is fighting Varun

 Can they be compared to Krishna and Arjuna? But there is a similarity between that and this Mahabharata that they too fought with their own, they have come to fight with their own
 haa, yah fark jarur he ki arjuna ke saath koi historishiter nahin tha
 On this occasion, Sonu Singh said that in the coming parliamentary elections, i will fully support the venerable Varun Bhaiya with all my heart and with full devotion and will try to win both my assemblies Sultanpur and Isoli by a huge vote
 sultanpur shuru se gandhi parivaar kaa garh rahaa he

 Keeping in mind the cleanliness, it has been said in the rules that elephants should be kept in the pond for at least three hours to bathe

 If the elephant is ill, the Mahavata will inform its owner or the temple authority, who will get him treated quickly after consulting a veterinarian

 There is a famous Russian book - How Man became Mahabali
 insaan kii tamaam vaigyanik or bauddhik uplabdhiyon kaa bakhaan karti is kitaab kaa pehla hi adhyay he-“prakruti kaa pinjraa
 ”the book states that man is strong because he has discovered the secrets of nature
 lekin prakruti se zyada nahin
 The most liberated and free-looking birds are actually slaves of that invisible cage of nature
 ve aasmaan ko is chor se us chor tak napate najar aate to hai, lekin phir bhi apni bhugolic or prakritik simaaon se baahar nahin jate
 Why was it necessary to mention this book and this story here? In fact, the list of birds that have visited the natural habitat of Uttarakhand Forest Department in the name of Journal of Birdlife International, is going to raise a lot of existing questions
 yah suchi bataati he ki uttarakhand se pakshiyon kii 28 prajatiyaan vilupt ho chuki hai
 The mountains, rivers and cold weather of Uttarakhand were once their home
 lekin ab ve use chhodkar jane kis namaaloom duniya main ja chuke hai
 It does not end here
 28 prajatiyaan vilupt ho gayi to 98 jane kahaan se vichrati hui chali bhi ain
 The first checklist of birds was first released by the Uttarakhand Forest Department in 2003
 is suchi main kul 623 prajati ke pakshiyon kaa zikr tha
 Now, after 11 years, the Forest Department released a checklist of birds found in the state for the second time, the results are surprising
 haalanki pakshiyon kii kul prajatiyon kii sankhya badhkar 693 ho gai he, lekin pehle pai jane vaali 28 prajatiyaan is suchi se baahar ja chuki hai
 Birds do not change their habitats in search of a better life like humans
 ve apana ghar tab tak nahin chhodte, jab tak astitv par sankat na aa jaae
 Therefore, the question of concern of wildlife lovers is that these birds could not keep pace with the changing ecological system here, so they left their shelters and flew elsewhere
 2003 main jari isi suchi main musuri ke jhadeepani or nainital main milane vaali mountain quail (parvatiy bater), jise himalayan quail bhi kehete hai, ke lupt ho jane kii ashanka vyakt kii gai thi
 The Mountain Quail is also not named in this list
 gaayab ho chuki 28 prajatiyon ke alaava bayers pochard, teen kism ke giddh slendar bild valchar, white valchar or red heded valchar ke astitv par bhi khatra bataaya gaya he
 Also extinct species are Rain Quail, King Quail, Lesser Lorican, Indian Corsair, Little Gal, Little Turn, Tibetan Sandcruz, European Turtle Dove, Bard Cuckoo Dove, Thick Build, Green Pigeon, Indian Swiftlet, Silver Breasted Bribil, Gray There are Chinnad Minivet, European Skylark, Gray Villied Tesia, Ready's Barbler, Yellow Browser Barbler, Thick Build Barbler, etc
 gujri farvari main pakshiyon ke is aakarshak sansar ke jariye eco paryaton ko badhaava dene ke liye uttarakhand sarkaar ne corbett neshnal park se lage pavalgadh conjarveshan rigerv main spring bird festival kaa bhi aayojan kiya tha
 This was the second bird festival in the state
 isse pehle dehradun ke paas asana bairaj main bird festival kiya gaya tha
 On one hand, the state government is planning to show these species of birds to the world to promote its eco-tourism and on the other hand the birds are becoming extinct
 yah suchi rajya sarkaar ke liye bhi bada jhatka he
 Expressing concern about birds going missing from Uttarakhand, state forest minister Dinesh Aggarwal says, “the state government is making people aware of wildlife
 hamaari koshish vanyajiwan ko logon ke rojgaar se jodgaye kii he, taaki ve unke sangrakshan ko lekar zyada gambhir ho saken
 The specialty of Pavalgarh Conservation Reserve is that in a small area, tweet of 352 species of birds is heard simultaneously
 haalanki 70 se zyada nai prajati ke pakshiyon kii aamad khushi kii baat bhi he
 Digvijay Singh Khati, the state's chief wildlife advocate says, "many species of birds have become extinct due to possibly changing ecological systems and this has also attracted new species
" ”rajya ke badalte paristhitikeey tantra kaa prabhaav sirf pakshiyon par hi nahin padaa he
 The existence of aquatic animals is also under threat
 baandh banane or nadiyon ke sookhne ke kaaran machhliyon kii kai prajatiyaan vilupt ho rahi hai

 es
 N
 bahuguna kehete hai, “srinagar main bane baandh ne alaknanda ko kai jagahon par sookhne kii sthiti main pahunchaa diya
 Due to this, the existence of fishes found here is also in danger
 ”manushya vikaas ke naam par prakruti ke saath khilwaad kar rahaa he, jangal kaat rahaa he, baandh bana rahaa he
 Somewhere the rivers are sinking and some places are drying up
 kahin pahaad fat rahe hai to kahin dharti vikaraal rup dhaaran kar rahi he
 The change of weather is that the person is shocked and disturbed
 pakshiyon or jeev-jantuon kaa kya kahen
 After all the talk is over, the question remains as it is
 manushya balavaan jarur he, lekin prakruti se zyada nahin
 The attempt to be more powerful than this has come in the form of turmoil
 rashtriya sankhyikee ayog ke do sadasyon ne mangalvaar ko achaanak istipha de diya

 The resignation of all non-government members from the National Statistical Commission has rendered yet another public institution defunct & toothlessit also serves the government's larger objective to black out all data & statistics of its mis-governance since last 5 years— Ahmed Patel (@ahmedpatel) In a special conversation with India Today after resigning January 29, 2019, PC Mohanan said that he has resigned due to neglect
 unhone kaha ki vibhinn muddon par kiye gaye unke kaam ko gambhirtha se nahin liya ja rahaa tha
 Both the resigned members say that the government has made the NSC toothless
 ayog ke yogadan ko gambhirtha se nahin liya ja rahaa he
 Another cause for controversy is the delay in releasing the survey of NSC in 2017-18
 enessi ne do maheene pehle report ko manjuuri de di thi, iske baavjood report saarvajanik nahin kii gai thi
 The government rejected the NSC report on GDP back series and called it just an exercise

 Indian Railways have a specialty
 wo jaise chaahati he yatri uske hisaab se dhal jate hai
 If the train runs late by 30 hours, then the passengers adjust accordingly
 asuvidhaon se adst hona yatri hona hota he
 We have adjusted so much to every question of the rail that even after reaching the delay of thirty hours, we go straight home
 kyonki ham apane samay kaa sammaan nahin karte hai
 We had railradar at six in the evening
 railyatri
 Visited in is website par se aap pataa kar sakate hai ki kis vakt kitni trainen samay se chal rahi hai or kitni deree se
 When we saw it at six in the evening, it was known that 68 percent of trains were running late
 yah deree kuch bhi ho sakati he
 Even for one minute and 20 hours
 laal nishaan bataa rahe hai ki bhartiya railway ko samay ke maamle main abhi bahut kuch karnaa he
 Whatever is being claimed to be done, this data does not seem to have produced any concrete result
 sirf 35 pratishat gaadiyaan samay se chal rahi hai
 Whenever we saw this website, trains are lying around it
 magar shanivaar ko railway ne samay par chalane kaa jo aankada diya he uske anusaar 2017-18 main kareeb 30 pratishat gaadiyaan hi deree se chali hai
 Now there is a difference between these two figures
 rilradar ke hisaab se hamane jab bhi dekha 60 se 70 fisadi gaadiyaan let rahi hai
 According to the Railway Ministry, only 30 percent of the trains have run late
 magar unka ausat saal bhar kaa he
 On Saturday, PTI reported that Ashwani Lohani, chairman of the Railway Board, has held a meeting regarding the time
 railway kaa maananaa he ki suraksha maanakon main sudhaar ke kaam ho rahe hai isliye deree kii samasya rahegi
 During the review, it was found that the trains passing through Kanpur, Tundla, Agra and Mughalsarai were not running in time
 railway kaa kahana he ki april main north setrail zone main deree se chalane kaa ausat 40 pratishat he
 You know that we have raised the issue of Freedom Fighter Express many times, now this train is running for a good time
 20 ghante 30 ghante kii deree se chal rahi thi wo ab nahin ho rahaa he
 GM of East Central Railway Lalit Chander Trivedi says that 12 such trains will now be monitored
 unke liye alag se rek kii vyavastha kar yani nai railgadee banaakar samay se chalaane kaa prayaas hoga
 Many passengers do not even know what your rights are due to train delays
 kam hi log hai jo sidhaa rail mantri yaa rail mantralay ke twitor handle par twit kar pate hai
 Seemanchal Express has run an average of 12 hours late in the year according to the Eatrain Info
 praaia yah train 10 ghante, 20 ghante or kabhi kabhi to 50 ghante kii deree se chalati hi he
 We raised the issue of this train a lot
 1 may se 7 may ke bich yah train nunatam 5 ghante kii deree se chali he or adhiktam 38 ghante kii deree se
 But if we raise the issue, then there is no significant improvement in its timing
 neshnal train inquairi system main ek hafte kaa hi data hota he
 - Seemanchal Express reached Anand Vihar Terminal on May 9 with a delay of 11 hours 25 minutes - 10 may ko anand vihaar pahunchi he 8 ghanta 17 minute kii deree se - Reached Anand Vihar on May 11 with a delay of 12 hours - 12 may ko anand vihaar pahunchi he 6 ghanta 15 minute kii deree se - Reached Anand Vihar on May 13 with a delay of 6 hours 20 minutes lekin simanchal 11 may ke baad se anand vihaar se jogbani ke liye har din samay par khuli he
 This is a big change
 khulti samay par he, ham khush hote hai, magar raste main let ho jaati he
 Our colleague Ajay Singh went to Varanasi station
 stesan to kaaphi saaf suthra ho gaya he
 One should not panic by seeing the crowds at the station, because the train runs on time or not, the crowd is an integral part of the Indian Railways

 When we put Varanasi station in the National Train Inquiry System, it showed that within eight hours 26 trains were seen running late there
 gorakhpur shalimaar express nunatam 10 minute kii deree se chal rahi thi or haridwar haavda superfast express 12 ghante 14 minute kii deree se chal rahi thi
 Ajay was at the station when 19306 going from Guwahati to Indore reached Varanasi with a delay of 10 hours
 ajay singh ko varanasi stesan par deree ke maare yatri apni pareshaani is ummid main bataane lage ki shaayad rail mantri kaa dhyaan jayega or ve deree se mukti dilaayenge
 a family was found who had gone to Chhapra for BHU treatment, they could not get treatment even after reaching the Varanasi due to the delayed running of the train
 unhone bataaya ki jinka sampark nahin tha wo aspataal main apana number nahin laga sake
 Their arrival became useless
 yahi dikkat kisi din airport par ho jaae to us din channel bhi netaaon ke bayaan chhodkar hawaii adde par pahunch jaaenge
 The coverage of the rail is reduced during the fog, but the delay is considered normal on normal days
 koi parvaah bhi nahin karata ki is deree se logon ke jivan par kya asar padataa he

 What happens in India? kya ham apane adhikaar jaanate hai, uskaa istamaal karte hai, kya itane adhikaar mili bhi hai, aakhir ham adhikaron kii baat kyon nahin karte hai

 magar iske liye aapako patna pahunch kar teen ghante ke bheetar tikat waapas karnaa hoga
 This is the rule, but the reality is that it is so difficult to get confirmed tickets in the Indian Railways that whoever gets the tickets does not cancel when they are late

 On 9 May 20501, the capital from Agartala to Anand Vihar arrived 4 hours 35 minutes late
 express train let he, paisanger train let he, local train kaa vahi haal he, rajdhani bhi kuch ko chhod samay par nahin pahunch rahi he
 Passengers in the capital and Duronto are getting a bottle of water for free when they are late, but the passenger, superfast, is delayed by 20-30 hours, why the water is not free for their passengers
 patna stesan par maa apane bachche ko jis nal se pani pilaa rahi he, nal se kitna kam pani aata he
 She goes to another tap where some people are filling up with water
 nal pinjre main band he
 When Habib's camera looks closely, drops of water are dripping
 yah janaab to mushkil se pani bhar paae, usee se galaa tar kar liya
 How hard water is dripping for common people
 jab aap stesan par 30 ghante train kaa intazaar karte hai to pani par hi kitna kharch ho jaataa hoga
 How much will it cost to eat in sab kaa hisaab joda janaa chahie
 Only the cost of Chinia almonds will not be added
 stesan par ek wedding mashin lagi he jisase log pani kharid rahe hai
 See the rate of water
 300 emel 1 rupaya, agar bottle ke saath lenge to 2 rupaya dena hoga
 3 rupees for 500ml water, 5 rupees with bottle
 2 litre ke liye 8 rupee dene honge or agar bottle bhi lenge to 12 rupee
 It is the water vending machine of IRCTC
 ab sochie agar aap amritsar-darambhaga jananaayak express se yatra kar rahe hon to aapaki kya haalat hogi
 The free water system from the stations is getting depleted or decreasing, so crowded that trains start filling up
 national train enquiry system kii website par aap train 15212 jananaayak express kaa number daaliye
 It also has a column of average delay
 use clic karenge to pataa chalegaa ki amritsar darbhanga jananaayak express darbhanga stesan par pahunchane kii ausat deree 21 ghanta 38 minute he
 This average is from 2 November 2017
 bataaiye pichley chah maheene se yah train 21 ghante 38 minute kii deree se darbhanga pahunch rahi he
 We have put a lot of emphasis on this train in our rail series but there is no improvement
 1 may se 7 may ke bich is train ke darbhanga pahunchane kaa ausat he 20 ghante 37 minute
 These are the minimum delays
 adhiktam deree kaa samay he 58 ghante 58 minute
 Information containing these
 info kii website se nikaali he
 On 4 May, which train has arrived late by 58 hours 58 minutes, do not ask such questions to Railway Minister on his Twitter handle
 jananaayak express kaa udhaaharan isliye diya kyonki is train main ek bhi asi coach nahin he
 All are generals
 zaahir he jab koi train 20 ghante se lekar 58 ghante tak let hogi to mazaduron ko pyaas bhi lagati hogi
 Should the railways not give them water bottles and food like the Rajdhanis and the Durants
 ab ham ek train kaa haal bataate hai
 a passenger gave information about the train and recorded the video from mobile
 yah train gorakhpur se sivaan ke bich chalati he
 Kushinagar passes through Tamkuhi Road
 yatri ne jo video bheja he usase coach kii haalat to thik dikhti he magar bheed bahut he
 This video is from 2-3 days ago
 yatri ne bataaya ki gorakhpur se khulne kaa samay he 5 bajkar 10 minute par, magar kai ghante kii deree se khulti he
 Its seat is very small
 yatri khadey hokar hi chalate hai
 Shivank, who is assisting in research for prime time, told Eatrain Info that this train completes a distance of 166 km in 5 hours
 agar iske let hone kaa ausat nikaalen or phir raftaar kaa hisaab karen to yah train ausatan 24 kimi prati ghante kii raftaar se chalati he yani kii malgadee ke baraabar
 On 31 May 2017, this train has run at a speed of 11 kph
 ek saal main 294 baar let hui he
 Has been canceled 12 times
 adhiktam deree 10 ghante or ausat deree 1 ghanta 42 minute he
 Ordinary people travel in this train
 yatri bheed se bhi pareshaan hai
 Through prime time, passengers want the railway minister to see it and do something
 bheed kam karne ke liye ek or rail chalaa den yaa phir coach badha den
 The comments kya aap jaanate hai ki rail gaadi chalaane vaale loko payalat 14 may, 15 may or 16 may ko kaala diwas manaa rahe hai
 The name of his performance is Mundi hot performance
 ye log chaahate hai ki ingine main asi kii vyavastha ho kyonki tej garmi main haalat kharaab ho jaati he
 Some of their demands are beyond our comprehension because we do not know the system of loco pilot
 ol india loko running staff sangh ke uttari kshetra ke adhyaksh paramjeet singh ne kaha ki 7wein vetan ayog ke hisaab 100 kimi par 848 rupaya bhatta milanaa chahie jabaki miltaa he 250 rupaya
 They claim that the number of posts sanctioned for loco pilots is one lakh but at present there are 85,000 loco pilots
 15000 kii kami ke kaaran inhen 10 ghante se zyaada kaam karnaa padaa he
 It is not okay to drive
 6-7 dinon kii nit duty di jaati he
 Many times a week holiday is not available
 inhone ek parchaa nikaala he
 It states that the temperature of the officer's mundi is 19 ° C, that is, they work in AC and the temperature of the mule of a pilot of a rail engine is 58 ° c because they work without AC
 jabaki rail bajet main ingine main asi lagane kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 The name of the demonstration is peculiar
 mundi garam
 i had never even heard such a performance name
 hamane shaam chah baje dekha to pataa chal rahaa tha ki 68 pratishat railgadiyaan deree se chal rahi hai
 This delay can be anything
 ek minute kii bhi or 20 ghante kii bhi
 Red marks are telling that Indian Railways have a lot to do in terms of time
 jo bhi kuch karne kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he is data se to nahin lagata ki koi thos nateeja niklaa he
 Only 35 percent of the vehicles are running on time
 hamane jab bhi is website ko dekha, isi ke aas paas trainen let rahi hai
 But according to the figures given by the railways on time on Saturday, only 30 percent of the trains in 2017-18 have been delayed
 ab in do aankadon main antar he
 According to the railroad, whenever we saw 60 to 70 percent of the vehicles were lying down
 rail mantralay ke hisaab se 30 pratishat gaadiyaan hi deree se chali hai
 But their average is around the year
 shanivaar ko pitiai kii khabar thi ki railway board ke chairman ashvini lohani ne samay ko lekar ek baithak kii he
 Railways believe that work is on to improve safety standards, so there will be a problem of delay
 baithak ke dauraan samiksha main paaya gaya ki kanpur, tundla, agra or mughalsarai se guzarane vaali gaadiyaan samay se nahin chal paa rahi hai
 The railways say the average delay in the North Setrell zone in April is 40 percent
 aap jaanate hai ki hamane swatantraaa senaanee express kaa maamla kai baar uthaaya, ab yah train thik thaak samay se chal rahi he
 It was running 20 hours and 30 hours late, it is not happening now

 There will be an attempt to run them on time by arranging a separate rake for them i

 Few people are able to tweet directly on the railway minister or the railway ministry's Twitter handle
 simanchal express itrain info ke hisaab se saal main 12 ghante kii ausat deree se chali he
 Often this train runs for 10 hours, 20 hours and sometimes 50 hours late
 hamane is train kaa masalaa khub uthaaya
 Between May 1 and May 7, the train ran for a minimum delay of 5 hours and a maximum delay of 38 hours
 lekin hamane iskaa masalaa uthaaya to isaki timming main kuch khaas sudhaar nahin hua he
 The National Train Inquiry system has only one week of data
 - simanchal express 9 may ko anand vihaar terminal pahunchi he 11 ghanta 25 minute kii deree se - reached Anand Vihar on May 10 with a delay of 8 hours 17 minutes - 11 may ko anand vihaar pahunchi he 12 ghante kii deree se - Reached Anand Vihar on May 12 with a delay of 6 hours 15 minutes - 13 may ko anand vihaar pahunchi he 6 ghanta 20 minute kii deree se But Seemanchal is open on time every day from May 11 to Anand Jogbani since May 11

 ajay stesan par hi the jab guwahati se indore jane vaali 19306 10 ghante kii deree se varanasi pahunchi
 Passengers delayed by delaying Ajay Singh at Varanasi station began to convey their problems in the hope that perhaps the Railway Minister would get attention and they would get rid of the delay
 ek parivaar mila jo chhapra se biechayu ilaaj ke liye chalaa tha, wo train ke deree se chalane ke kaaran varanasi pahunch kar bhi ilaaj nahin kara sakaa
 He told that those who were not contacted could not put their number in the hospital
 unka aana bekaar ho gaya
 If the same problem happens at the airport someday, then on that day the channels will also leave the statements of the leaders and reach the airport
 kohre ke samay rail kaa kawarej to ho jaataa he magar aam dinon main deree ko saamaanya maan liya jaataa he
 Nobody cares what effect this delay has on people's lives

 17 november 2017 kii ek khabar duniya bhar main charchit hui thi
 The managers of the Tsukovo Express Line in Japan apologized for the train running between Tokyo and Tsukova as it had opened 20 seconds earlier
 japan main train let hoti he to har yatri ko ek certificate diya jaataa he
 But do you know how much the average annual delay is in Japan
 maatr 0
 9 minutes
 bataaiye puure saal japan kii sari trainon kaa let chalane kaa ausat ek minute bhi nahin he
 In India, even after 71 hours, no one apologizes nor is angry at it
 bharat main kya hota he
 Do we know our rights, use them, have we got so many rights, why don't we talk about rights? yah mudda kyon nahin he, kyon yatri 30 se 70 ghante kii yatnaa bhi sehate hai or badale main unhen kuch miltaa bhi nahin he

 But for this, you will have to return the ticket within three hours after reaching Patna
 ye niyam to he magar hakeekat yah he ki bhartiya rail main conform tikat milanaa itnaa mushkil he ki jise bhi tikat miltaa he vah let hone par cancel nahin karaata he
 Sitting for thirty hours and singing for fifty hours, we go on the same train
 18 april 2018 ke financial express main ek or khabar mili
 If Rajdhani and Duronto are late for more than two hours after a 20-hour journey, then the passenger will get one bottle of Rail Neer free from the railway side
 bottle ke saath cap bhi hoga
 Anyway, travelers get one bottle free
 is meharbaani par kiskaa dil na aa jaae
 Rajdhani Express is generally known for running on time but it is not so now
 11 may ko dibrugarh rajdhani jo dibrugarh se nai dilli aati he 4 ghante 38 minute let thi
 etrain
 info ek privet site he
 If you enter the train number on it, then you can see the record for the year
 shivank ne is site par research kar bataaya ki dibrugarh rajdhani pichley saal 9 oktober ko 13 ghante let thi
 If we see the average running time, then this train is late by 2 hours
 agartala se anand vihaar aane vaali rajdhani express 26 march ko 11 ghante let ai
 The weather is fine in March
 9 may ko 20501 agartala se anand vihaar aane vaali rajdhani 4 ghante 35 minute kii deree se pahunchi
 Express train is late, passenger train is late, local train is in the same condition, except Rajdhani is not reaching on time
 rajdhani or duranton ke yatriyon ko let hone par ek bottle pani free mil rahaa he, lekin paseegenr, superfast to 20-30 ghante kii deree se chalati he, unke yatriyon ke liye pani kaa bolat free kyon nahin he
 The tap with which the mother is giving water to her child at Patna station, how little water comes from the tap
 vah ek or nal par jaati he jahaan kuch log pani bhar rahe hai
 The tap is locked in the cage
 jab habib kaa camera kareeb se dekhtaa he to pani kii boonden tapak rahi hoti hai
 This man could barely fill the water, he strangled him
 aam logon ke liye pani bhi kitni mushkil se tapakataa he
 When you wait for the train for 30 hours at the station, how much will be spent on the water itself
 khaane par kitna kharch hota hoga
 All these should be accounted for
 sirf chinia baadaam kaa kharchaa nahin joda jayega
 a wedding machine is installed at the station from which people are buying water
 pani kaa rate aap dekh lijie
 300 ml 1 rupees, if taken with the bottle, you will have to pay 2 rupees
 500 emal pani ke liye 3 rupaya, bottle ke saath 5 rupaya
 You have to pay 8 rupees for 2 liters and 12 rupees if you take the bottle
 ye iarsitisi kaa water vending mashin he
 Now think what will be your condition if you are traveling by amritsar-darumbhaga Jannayak Express
 steshnon se muft pani kaa system khatm hota ja rahaa he yaa kam hota ja rahaa he, itani bheed hoti he ki bharte bharte train chalane lagati he

 is extracted from the website of info
 4 may ko koun si train 58 ghante 58 minute kii deree se pahunchi he, aap is tarah ke sawaal rail mantri se unke twitor handle par na karen
 The example of Jananayak Express is given because there is not a single AC coach in this train
 sabhi general hai
 It is obvious that when a train is late for 20 hours to 58 hours, the workers will also feel thirsty
 kya railway ko rajdhani or duranton kii tarah inhen pani kii bottle or khaanaa nahin dena chahie
 Now we tell the condition of a train
 ek yatri ne train ke bare main soochna di or mobile se video record kar bheja he

 Passenger told that the time to open from Gorakhpur is at 5
10 am, but it is delayed by several hours
 isaki seat bahut choti he
 Passengers stand and walk
 prime time ke liye research main madad kar rahe shivank ne itrain info se bataaya ki yah train 166 kimi kii duuri 5 ghante main puraa karti he
 If you find the average of its latency and then calculate the speed, then this train runs at an average speed of 24 km per hour, that is, equivalent to a freight train

 It is lying 294 times in a year

 But if we raise the issue, then there is no significant improvement in its timing

 Our colleague Ajay Singh went to Varanasi station
 stesan to kaaphi saaf suthra ho gaya he

 magar iske liye aapako patna pahunch kar teen ghante ke bheetar tikat waapas karnaa hoga
 This is the rule, but the reality is that it is so difficult to get confirmed tickets in the Indian Railways that whoever gets the tickets does not cancel when they are late

 Financial Express of 18 April 2018 received another news

 jab aap stesan par 30 ghante train kaa intazaar karte hai to pani par hi kitna kharch ho jaataa hoga
 How much will it cost to eat in sab kaa hisaab joda janaa chahie
 Only the cost of Chinia almonds will not be added
 stesan par ek wedding mashin lagi he jisase log pani kharid rahe hai
 See the rate of water
 300 emel 1 rupaya, agar bottle ke saath lenge to 2 rupaya dena hoga
 3 rupees for 500ml water, 5 rupees with bottle
 2 litre ke liye 8 rupee dene honge or agar bottle bhi lenge to 12 rupee
 It is the water vending machine of IRCTC
 ab sochie agar aap amritsar-darambhaga jananaayak express se yatra kar rahe hon to aapaki kya haalat hogi
 The free water system from the stations is getting depleted or decreasing, so crowded that trains start filling up

 These are the minimum delays
 adhiktam deree kaa samay he 58 ghante 58 minute
 Information containing these
 info kii website se nikaali he
 On 4 May, which train has arrived late by 58 hours 58 minutes, do not ask such questions to Railway Minister on his Twitter handle
 jananaayak express kaa udhaaharan isliye diya kyonki is train main ek bhi asi coach nahin he
 All are generals
 zaahir he jab koi train 20 ghante se lekar 58 ghante tak let hogi to mazaduron ko pyaas bhi lagati hogi
 Should the railways not give them water bottles and food like the Rajdhanis and the Durants
 ab ham ek train kaa haal bataate hai
 a passenger gave information about the train and recorded the video from mobile
 yah train gorakhpur se sivaan ke bich chalati he
 Kushinagar passes through Tamkuhi Road
 yatri ne jo video bheja he usase coach kii haalat to thik dikhti he magar bheed bahut he
 This video is from 2-3 days ago
 yatri ne bataaya ki gorakhpur se khulne kaa samay he 5 bajkar 10 minute par, magar kai ghante kii deree se khulti he
 Its seat is very small
 yatri khadey hokar hi chalate hai
 Shivank, who is assisting in research for prime time, told Eatrain Info that this train completes a distance of 166 km in 5 hours
 agar iske let hone kaa ausat nikaalen or phir raftaar kaa hisaab karen to yah train ausatan 24 kimi prati ghante kii raftaar se chalati he yani kii malgadee ke baraabar
 On 31 May 2017, this train has run at a speed of 11 kph
 ek saal main 294 baar let hui he
 Has been canceled 12 times
 adhiktam deree 10 ghante or ausat deree 1 ghanta 42 minute he
 Ordinary people travel in this train
 yatri bheed se bhi pareshaan hai
 Through prime time, passengers want the railway minister to see it and do something
 bheed kam karne ke liye ek or rail chalaa den yaa phir coach badha den
 The comments kya aap jaanate hai ki rail gaadi chalaane vaale loko payalat 14 may, 15 may or 16 may ko kaala diwas manaa rahe hai
 The name of his performance is Mundi hot performance
 ye log chaahate hai ki ingine main asi kii vyavastha ho kyonki tej garmi main haalat kharaab ho jaati he
 Some of their demands are beyond our comprehension because we do not know the system of loco pilot
 ol india loko running staff sangh ke uttari kshetra ke adhyaksh paramjeet singh ne kaha ki 7wein vetan ayog ke hisaab 100 kimi par 848 rupaya bhatta milanaa chahie jabaki miltaa he 250 rupaya
 They claim that the number of posts sanctioned for loco pilots is one lakh but at present there are 85,000 loco pilots
 15000 kii kami ke kaaran inhen 10 ghante se zyaada kaam karnaa padaa he
 It is not okay to drive
 6-7 dinon kii nit duty di jaati he
 Many times a week holiday is not available
 inhone ek parchaa nikaala he
 It states that the temperature of the officer's mundi is 19 ° C, that is, they work in AC and the temperature of the mule of a pilot of a rail engine is 58 ° c because they work without AC
 jabaki rail bajet main ingine main asi lagane kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 The name of the demonstration is peculiar
 mundi garam
 i had never even heard such a performance name
 train deree hone par aapke kya adhikaar hai, bahut se yatriyon ko pataa bhi nahin hota
 Few people are able to tweet directly on the railway minister or the railway ministry's Twitter handle
 simanchal express itrain info ke hisaab se saal main 12 ghante kii ausat deree se chali he
 Often this train runs for 10 hours, 20 hours and sometimes 50 hours late
 hamane is train kaa masalaa khub uthaaya
 Between May 1 and May 7, the train ran for a minimum delay of 5 hours and a maximum delay of 38 hours
 lekin hamane iskaa masalaa uthaaya to isaki timming main kuch khaas sudhaar nahin hua he
 The National Train Inquiry system has only one week of data
 - simanchal express 9 may ko anand vihaar terminal pahunchi he 11 ghanta 25 minute kii deree se - reached Anand Vihar on May 10 with a delay of 8 hours 17 minutes - 11 may ko anand vihaar pahunchi he 12 ghante kii deree se - Reached Anand Vihar on May 12 with a delay of 6 hours 15 minutes - 13 may ko anand vihaar pahunchi he 6 ghanta 20 minute kii deree se But Seemanchal is open on time every day from May 11 to Anand Jogbani since May 11

 It is on opening time, we are happy, but it is late on the way
 hamaare sahyogi ajay singh varanasi stesan par gaye
 The station has become very clean
 stesan par bheed dekhakar nahin ghabraana chahie, kyonki train samay se chale yaa na chale, bheed bhartiya railway kaa abhinn hissaa he
 Ajay Singh was at Varanasi station around four in the afternoon
 vahaan unhone dekha ki lambii duuri kii zyaadaatar trainen deree se chal rahi thim

 Gorakhpur Shalimar Express was running at least 10 minutes late and Haridwar Howrah Superfast Express was running late by 12 hours 14 minutes
 ajay stesan par hi the jab guwahati se indore jane vaali 19306 10 ghante kii deree se varanasi pahunchi
 Passengers delayed by delaying Ajay Singh at Varanasi station began to express their problems in the hope that perhaps the Railway Minister would get attention and they would get rid of the delay
 ek parivaar mila jo chhapra se biechayu ilaaj ke liye chalaa tha, wo train ke deree se chalane ke kaaran varanasi pahunch kar bhi ilaaj nahin kara sakaa
 He told that those who were not contacted could not put their number in the hospital
 unka aana bekaar ho gaya
 If the same problem happens at the airport someday, then on that day the channels will also leave the statements of the leaders and reach the airport
 kohre ke samay rail kaa kawarej to ho jaataa he magar aam dinon main deree ko saamaanya maan liya jaataa he
 Nobody cares what effect this delay has on people's lives

 17 november 2017 kii ek khabar duniya bhar main charchit hui thi
 The managers of the Tsukovo Express Line in Japan apologized for the train running between Tokyo and Tsukova as it had opened 20 seconds earlier
 japan main train let hoti he to har yatri ko ek certificate diya jaataa he
 But do you know how much the average annual delay is in Japan
 maatr 0
 9 minutes
 bataaiye puure saal japan kii sari trainon kaa let chalane kaa ausat ek minute bhi nahin he
 In India, even after 71 hours, no one apologizes nor is angry at it
 bharat main kya hota he
 Do we know our rights, use them, have we got so many rights, why don't we talk about rights? yah mudda kyon nahin he, kyon yatri 30 se 70 ghante kii yatnaa bhi sehate hai or badale main unhen kuch miltaa bhi nahin he
 We went to http: / / www

 indianrailways

 in on
 agar aapaki train teen ghante se zyaada kii deree se chal rahi ho to aap apana tikat yatra shuru hone ke stesan par cancil kara sakate hai
 In return you will get the fare back without any deduction
 agar aap dilli se patna gaye or vahaan se haavda kii train leni he, deree hone ke kaaran agar haavda kii train chhot jaati he to aisi sthiti main patna se haavda kaa kiraaya waapas ho jayega
 But for this, you will have to return the ticket within three hours after reaching Patna
 ye niyam to he magar hakeekat yah he ki bhartiya rail main conform tikat milanaa itnaa mushkil he ki jise bhi tikat miltaa he vah let hone par cancel nahin karaata he
 Sitting for thirty hours and singing for fifty hours, we go on the same train
 18 april 2018 ke financial express main ek or khabar mili
 If Rajdhani and Duronto are late for more than two hours after a 20-hour journey, then the passenger will get one bottle of Rail Neer free from the railway side
 bottle ke saath cap bhi hoga
 Anyway, travelers get one bottle free
 is meharbaani par kiskaa dil na aa jaae
 Rajdhani Express is generally known for running on time but it is not so now
 11 may ko dibrugarh rajdhani jo dibrugarh se nai dilli aati he 4 ghante 38 minute let thi
 etrain
 info ek privet site he
 If you enter the train number on it, then you can see the record for the year
 shivank ne is site par research kar bataaya ki dibrugarh rajdhani pichley saal 9 oktober ko 13 ghante let thi
 If we see the average running time, then this train is late by 2 hours
 agartala se anand vihaar aane vaali rajdhani express 26 march ko 11 ghante let ai
 The weather is fine in March
 9 may ko 20501 agartala se anand vihaar aane vaali rajdhani 4 ghante 35 minute kii deree se pahunchi
 Express train is late, passenger train is late, local train is in the same condition, except Rajdhani is not reaching on time
 rajdhani or duranton ke yatriyon ko let hone par ek bottle pani free mil rahaa he, lekin paseegenr, superfast to 20-30 ghante kii deree se chalati he, unke yatriyon ke liye pani kaa bolat free kyon nahin he
 The tap with which the mother is giving water to her child at Patna station, how little water comes from the tap
 vah ek or nal par jaati he jahaan kuch log pani bhar rahe hai
 The tap is locked in the cage
 jab habib kaa camera kareeb se dekhtaa he to pani kii boonden tapak rahi hoti hai
 This man could barely fill the water, he strangled him
 aam logon ke liye pani bhi kitni mushkil se tapakataa he
 When you wait for the train for 30 hours at the station, how much will be spent on the water itself
 khaane par kitna kharch hota hoga
 All these should be accounted for
 sirf chinia baadaam kaa kharchaa nahin joda jayega
 a wedding machine is installed at the station from which people are buying water
 pani kaa rate aap dekh lijie
 300 ml 1 rupees, if taken with the bottle, you will have to pay 2 rupees
 500 emal pani ke liye 3 rupaya, bottle ke saath 5 rupaya
 You have to pay 8 rupees for 2 liters and 12 rupees if you take the bottle
 ye iarsitisi kaa water vending mashin he
 Now think what will be your condition if you are traveling by amritsar-darumbhaga Jannayak Express
 steshnon se muft pani kaa system khatm hota ja rahaa he yaa kam hota ja rahaa he, itani bheed hoti he ki bharte bharte train chalane lagati he
 On the website of national train inquiry system, you enter the number of 15215 Jannayak Express
 isamen ausat deree kaa bhi ek kollam he
 If you click on it, it will be known that the average delay of reaching Amritsar Darbhanga Jannayak Express Darbhanga station is 21 hours 38 minutes
 yah ausat 2 november 2017 se he
 Tell that for the last six months this train is reaching Darbhanga with a delay of 21 hours 38 minutes
 hamane apni rail series main is train par kaaphi jor diya he magar koi sudhaar nahin he
 The average time for this train to reach Darbhanga from May 1 to May 7 is 20 hours 37 minutes
 ye nunatam deree bataa rahe hai
 The maximum delay time is 58 hours 58 minutes
 ye vaali jaankaree etrain
 is extracted from the website of info
 4 may ko koun si train 58 ghante 58 minute kii deree se pahunchi he, aap is tarah ke sawaal rail mantri se unke twitor handle par na karen
 The example of Jananayak Express is given because there is not a single AC coach in this train
 sabhi general hai
 It is obvious that when a train is late for 20 hours to 58 hours, the workers will also feel thirsty
 kya railway ko rajdhani or duranton kii tarah inhen pani kii bottle or khaanaa nahin dena chahie
 Now we tell the condition of a train
 ek yatri ne train ke bare main soochna di or mobile se video record kar bheja he
 This train runs between Gorakhpur to Siwan
 kushinagar tamakuhi road se hokar guzarati he
 The video sent by the passenger shows the condition of the coach but the crowd is very large
 yah video do teen din pehle kaa he
 Passenger told that the time to open from Gorakhpur is at 5
10 am, but it is delayed by several hours
 isaki seat bahut choti he
 Passengers stand and walk
 prime time ke liye research main madad kar rahe shivank ne itrain info se bataaya ki yah train 166 kimi kii duuri 5 ghante main puraa karti he
 If you find the average of its latency and then calculate the speed, then this train runs at an average speed of 24 km per hour, that is, equivalent to a freight train
 31 may 2017 ko yah train 11 kisi prati ghante kii raftaar se chali he
 It is lying 294 times in a year
 12 baar radd hui he
 The maximum delay is 10 hours and the average delay is 1 hour 42 minutes
 is train main saadhaaran log safar karte hai
 Passengers are also disturbed by the crowd
 prime time ke zarie yatri chaahate hai ki rail mantri ise dekhen or kuch karen
 To reduce congestion, run another train or increase the coach
 tippaniyan Do you know that the loco pilots driving the train are celebrating Black Day on 14 May, 15 May and 16 May
 inke pradarshan kaa naam he mundi garam pradarshan
 These people want the engine to have AC because the condition gets worse in the hot summer
 inaki kuch maangen hamaari samaj se baahar hai kyonki ham loko payalat kii vyavastha ko nahin jaanate hai
 Paramjit Singh, president of the Northern Region of All India Loco Running Staff Association, said that according to the 7th Pay Commission, an allowance of Rs 848 should be given on 100 km while Rs 250
 inkaa daawa he ki loko payalat ke liye manzur padon kii sankhya ek lakh he magar is vakt 85,000 loko payalat hai
 Due to the shortage of 15,000, they have to work more than 10 hours
 gaadi chalaane ke liye thik nahin he
 Night duty of 6-7 days is given
 kai baar hafte kii chuttee bhi nahin milti he
 He has taken out a form
 isamen likhaa he ki adhikari ke mundi kaa taapmaana 19 degree celsius hota he yani ve asi main kaam karte hai or rail ingine ke payalat kii mundi kaa taapmaana 58 degree celsius hota he kyonki ve bina asi ke kaam karte hai
 Whereas in the Rail Budget, provision has been made to install AC in the engine
 dharna pradarshan kaa naam hi vicitra he
 Shave hot pradarshan kaa aisa naam to maine bhi kabhi nahin suna tha
 - Seemanchal Express reached Anand Vihar Terminal on May 9 with a delay of 11 hours 25 minutes - 10 may ko anand vihaar pahunchi he 8 ghanta 17 minute kii deree se - Reached Anand Vihar on May 11 with a delay of 12 hours - 12 may ko anand vihaar pahunchi he 6 ghanta 15 minute kii deree se - Reached Anand Vihar on May 13 with a delay of 6 hours 20 minutes lekin simanchal 11 may ke baad se anand vihaar se jogbani ke liye har din samay par khuli he
 This is a big change

 Our colleague Ajay Singh went to Varanasi station
 stesan to kaaphi saaf suthra ho gaya he

 ajay singh ko varanasi stesan par deree ke maare yatri apni pareshaani is ummid main bataane lage ki shaayad rail mantri kaa dhyaan jayega or ve deree se mukti dilaayenge
 a family was found who had gone to Chhapra for BHU treatment, they could not get treatment even after reaching the Varanasi due to the delayed running of the train
 unhone bataaya ki jinka sampark nahin tha wo aspataal main apana number nahin laga sake
 Their arrival became useless
 yahi dikkat kisi din airport par ho jaae to us din channel bhi netaaon ke bayaan chhodkar hawaii adde par pahunch jaaenge
 The coverage of the rail is reduced during the fog, but the delay is considered normal on normal days
 koi parvaah bhi nahin karata ki is deree se logon ke jivan par kya asar padataa he

 japan main sukovo express line ke prabandhakon ne tokyo or sukova ke bich chalane vaali train ke liye maafee maangi kyonki vah 20 second pehle khul gai thi
 In Japan, when the train is late, every passenger is given a certificate
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki japan main salanaa ausat deree kitni he

 Tell us that the average speed of all trains in Japan throughout the year is not even one minute
 bharat main to 71 ghante baad bhi pahunch kar na to koi maafee maangata he na is par naaraaz hota he
 What happens in India? kya ham apane adhikaar jaanate hai, uskaa istamaal karte hai, kya itane adhikaar mili bhi hai, aakhir ham adhikaron kii baat kyon nahin karte hai
 Why is this not the issue, why the passengers endure 30 to 70 hours of torture and they do not get anything in return

 If your train is running late by more than three hours, you can cancel your ticket at the station of the journey
 iske badale main aapako bina katautee ke kiraaya waapas milegaa
 If you go from Delhi to Patna and have to take Howrah train from there, if you miss the Howrah train due to delay then in such a situation the fare from Patna to Howrah will be refunded
 magar iske liye aapako patna pahunch kar teen ghante ke bheetar tikat waapas karnaa hoga
 This is the rule, but the reality is that it is so difficult to get confirmed tickets in the Indian Railways that whoever gets the tickets does not cancel when they are late

 Passengers in the capital and Duronto are getting a bottle of water for free when they are late, but the passenger, superfast, is delayed by 20-30 hours, why the water is not free for their passengers

 But do you know how much the average annual delay is in Japan

 bataaiye puure saal japan kii sari trainon kaa let chalane kaa ausat ek minute bhi nahin he
 In India, even after 71 hours, no one apologizes nor is angry at it
 bharat main kya hota he
 Do we know our rights, use them, have we got so many rights, why don't we talk about rights? yah mudda kyon nahin he, kyon yatri 30 se 70 ghante kii yatnaa bhi sehate hai or badale main unhen kuch miltaa bhi nahin he

 But for this, you will have to return the ticket within three hours after reaching Patna
 ye niyam to he magar hakeekat yah he ki bhartiya rail main conform tikat milanaa itnaa mushkil he ki jise bhi tikat miltaa he vah let hone par cancel nahin karaata he

 Anyway, travelers get one bottle free

 Rajdhani Express is generally known for running on time but it is not so now
 11 may ko dibrugarh rajdhani jo dibrugarh se nai dilli aati he 4 ghante 38 minute let thi
 etrain

 If you enter the train number on it, then you can see the record for the year

 agartala se anand vihaar aane vaali rajdhani express 26 march ko 11 ghante let ai
 The weather is fine in March
 9 may ko 20501 agartala se anand vihaar aane vaali rajdhani 4 ghante 35 minute kii deree se pahunchi
 Express train is late, passenger train is late, local train is in the same condition, except Rajdhani is not reaching on time
 rajdhani or duranton ke yatriyon ko let hone par ek bottle pani free mil rahaa he, lekin paseegenr, superfast to 20-30 ghante kii deree se chalati he, unke yatriyon ke liye pani kaa bolat free kyon nahin he
 The tap with which the mother is giving water to her child at Patna station, how little water comes from the tap
 vah ek or nal par jaati he jahaan kuch log pani bhar rahe hai
 The tap is locked in the cage
 jab habib kaa camera kareeb se dekhtaa he to pani kii boonden tapak rahi hoti hai
 This man could barely fill the water, he strangled him
 aam logon ke liye pani bhi kitni mushkil se tapakataa he
 When you wait for the train for 30 hours at the station, how much will be spent on the water itself
 khaane par kitna kharch hota hoga
 All these should be accounted for
 sirf chinia baadaam kaa kharchaa nahin joda jayega
 a wedding machine is installed at the station from which people are buying water
 pani kaa rate aap dekh lijie
 300 ml 1 rupees, if taken with the bottle, you will have to pay 2 rupees
 500 emal pani ke liye 3 rupaya, bottle ke saath 5 rupaya
 You have to pay 8 rupees for 2 liters and 12 rupees if you take the bottle

 The tap is locked in the cage
 jab habib kaa camera kareeb se dekhtaa he to pani kii boonden tapak rahi hoti hai
 This man could barely fill the water, he strangled him
 aam logon ke liye pani bhi kitni mushkil se tapakataa he
 When you wait for the train for 30 hours at the station, how much will be spent on the water itself
 khaane par kitna kharch hota hoga
 All these should be accounted for

 rote gaate tees ghante, pachaas ghante baithkar usee train main jaataa he
 Financial Express of 18 April 2018 received another news
