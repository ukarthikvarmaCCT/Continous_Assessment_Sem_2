 Sholay was a film whose character is still alive in people's minds
 khaskar wo kirdaar jo villen hote hue bhi star ban gaya tha
 That character was the robber Gabbar Singh
 darasal gabbar kaalpanik nahin balki ek asal daaku kaa naam tha
 Who ruled in Chambal for a decade
 vah police ke liye sabase bada sirdard ban gaya tha
 Gabbar hated the police
 koun tha gabbar singhchambal kaa kukhyat daaku gabbar singh urf gabara kaa janm 1926 main bhind jile ke daang gaanv main hua tha
 He used to be an ordinary youth of the village but later he turned to the world of crime
 gabbar ne 1955 main apana ghar or gaanv chhod diya tha
 And he had joined the gang of then famous Chitrakalyan Singh Gujar
 apana gang banayagabbar singh ne gang main shaamil hokar kai vaardaaton ko anjaam diya
 But his friendship with Kalyan Gujar did not last long
 kuch maheene baad hi gabbar singh ne apana gang bana liya tha
 Gradually, his name began to resonate with bullets in the Chambal valleys
 uskaa giroh ab uske naam se kukhyat ho gaya tha
 Gabbar's Terror In the ravines of Madhya Pradesh in the 50s, Gabbar's name was becoming synonymous with terror
 log uske naam se khauf khaane lage the
 The police department was also disturbed by his antics
 aae din wo sangeen vaardaaton ko anjaam de rahaa tha
 Cases were increasing in his name in the police records
 chambal main uske naam kii tuuti bolne lagi thi
 In Bhind, Gwalior, Etawah, Dholpur, Gabbar was so afraid that no one was willing to talk about him
 logon ke naak kaan kaat letaa tha gabbarek kisi tantric ne daaku gabbar singh se kaha tha ki agar vah apni kul devi ko 116 logon ke kate hue naak kaan chadhayega to police yaa kisi or kii goli uskaa kuch nahin bigaad paaegi
 This thing had gone home in Gabbar's mind
 us vakt daaku gabbar singh ne pran liya tha ki wo apni kul devi ke saamne 116 logon ke naak kaan katkar devi ko bhent chadhayega
 And after that Gabbar cut off the nose ears of hundreds of people
 jiname adhiktar police vaale shaamil the
 Inam: Every day a new page was being added to the book of crime of fifty thousand thousand
 uttar pradesh or madhya pradesh samet teen rajyon kii police use talash rahi thi
 It was very difficult to catch him
 isi vajah se police ne 50 ke us dashak main daaku gabbar singh ke sir par 50 hajaar rupee kaa nakad inaam rakhaa tha
 At that time it was the biggest reward placed on the head of a wanted criminal in India
 nehru bhi the pareshandaku gabbar singh ko pakadana police ke liye mushkil ho gaya tha
 When the police and his gang were confronted
 to ulte muthbhed main police ko hi zyaada nuksaan jhelana padataa tha
 There were about 16 gangs in Chambal at that time but the gang of dacoit Gabbar Singh was heavy
 desh ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru bhi chabal ke halaat or daakuon ke giroh ko lekar kaafii phikrmand the
 The youth officers had got the responsibility, the governments of the country and the state were worried about Daku Gabbar Singh
 har koi uskaa khaatmaa chahta tha
 It is from 1959
 ek ahm baithak main gabbar ko khatm karne ke liye yojana banaai gai
 And the task of eliminating it was entrusted to young police officer Rajendra Prasad Modi
 us vakt modi dipti espi the
 He also participated in the operation against the notorious dacoit Putlibai that same year
 magar gabbar singh kaa encounter ipies afasar ke
 F
 rustamaji ne kiya tha
 He was the only police officer to receive the Padma Vibhushan Award
 ke
 F
 rustamaji 6 saal se zyada samay tak tatkaaleen pradhanmantri ke mukhya suraksha adhikari bhi rahe the
 According to the book Gabbar's British, the Bandits and the Borderman, in November 1959, a villager named Ramcharan was given important information about Gabbar Singh, according to the book 'the British, the Bandits and the Bordermen'
 kyonki modi ne ek baar uske bachche kii jaan bachaai thi
 The police came into action as soon as the information was received
 13 november ke din police ne gabbar ke thikaane ko gher liya
 There was tremendous firing from both sides
 dspi modi raat hone se pehle oparation khatm karnaa chaahate the
 They came very close to the fighting Gabbar gang
 modi ne daakuon par do grenade phenke or hamalaa kiya
 Still firing continued on behalf of the bandits
 ek grenade gabbar singh ke paas gira or uskaa jabada buree tarah jakhmi ho gaya tha
 After some time, Chabar's terror bandit Gabbar Singh was killed
 police ne uske puure gang kaa safaya kar diya tha
 This encounter took place in front of people
 gaanv vaale or rahgeer ek railgadee kii chat par khadey hokar muthbhed dekh rahe the
 People gathered on the roofs of buses on this highway
 gabbar singh par kitabadaku gabbar singh ke kai kisse tatkaaleen ipies afasar keef rustamaji kii diary main darj the
 Rustomji was the Inspector General of Madhya Pradesh Police in the 50s
 rustamaji rozaana diary likhaa karte the
 Which was later turned into a book by IPS officer PV Rajagopal
 us kitaab kaa naam tha 'da british, da bandits and da borderman
 'rajagopal wrote this book under Rustomji's permission and his own guidance
 aise 'sholay' main aayaa daaku gabbar singhshole film ke gabbar kii kahani bhale hi sidhe-sidhe asli gabbar kii kahani se alag thi
 But the writer of the film, Salim Khan was well aware of the story of Chakbal's dreadful Daku Gabbar Singh
 isaki vajah yah thi ki saleem ke pita bhi madhya pradesh police main adhikari the
 Salim used to hear about Gabbar the day he came from him
 jab ve sholay film kii kahani likh rahe the
 So from there, the character of dacoit Gabbar Singh came into his mind

 mumbai police ne shuukravaar ko congress ke purv nagar pramukh kripashankar singh ke parisaron par chaape maare
 Kripa Shankar is accused of accumulating benami property
 ek police adhikari ne kaha ki upnagareey mumbai main kripashankar ke ghar or karyaalay par chapa maaraa gaya
 We are searching for papers that can be used for investigation
 mumbai congress ke purv pramukh kripashankar par dhokhadhadi ke aarope hai
 Kripa Shankar took refuge in the Supreme Court yesterday against the High Court's order to prosecute him and attach his immovable property after an FIR was lodged by the city police in a disproportionate assets case two days ago
 ucch nyaayalay ne 22 farvari ko kripashankar ke khilaaf pratham drushtya aapraadhik kadachaar kii baat sweekaar karte hue uske khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kaa aadesh diya tha
 a division bench of Chief Justice Mohit Shah and Justice Roshan Dalvi said that Deputy Commissioner of Police Arup Patnaik should seek permission from the government to prosecute Kripa Shankar Singh for criminal misconduct under the Prevention of Corruption Act

 The court said it began public life simply in the 1970s: it did not earn much until becoming an MLA in 1998

 Is Narendra Modi the originator of modernism or a traditionalist? They are progressives or entangled in the past, no matter how glorious that past is
 Is his aspiration to take India to a bright new future or to bring back the gold birds? Many of his followers have told me the answers to these three questions — they are the promoters of progressive modernism who want to take India to a golden future
 ve technology ke diwane hai or vigyaan ke prashansak hai
 He drew inspiration from Obama to use social media for political propaganda and greatly improved it
 ve apane saathi shasnadhyakshon (yahaan zikr australia ke pradhanmantri tony abot kaa he) ke saath selfi lete hai or use twit kar dete hai
 When the bewildering actress of Mumbai film industry takes a selfie with a foot high on her shoulder, she takes a royal look and asks, "done?" In many ways, after Rajiv Gandhi, he is India's most modern The Prime Minister appears
 yahaan tak aane ke baad hamen ek or prashn karnaa aavashyak he
 Does his government reflect his own modern thinking or is he immersed in the past thinking of the RSS? The two cannot run together
 aadhunik soch kaa matlab he vigyaan, technology, ab tak anchhue rahasyon ko jaanane kii utsukata, yah sweekaar karne kii vinamrata ki maanav jati ko abhi nae kshitij chune hai or ham abhi jo kuch jaanate hai, vah uskaa leshmaatr he jo ham nahin jaanate
 In contrast, the traditionalist thinking of the RSS says that everything that the human desires to discover, create or imagine in the future has been achieved in the Vedic period
 is sthiti main to hamen sirf veda, puraana or upanishdon kaa khule dimag se, par gaharaai se adhyayan bhar karnaa he
 We lost all this because the Hindu empire and legacy were shattered with the fall of the Gupta and Maurya dynasties
 itnaa hi nahin, pashchim se aakrantaon ke aane ke kaaran musalamaanon or phir isaayiyon ne hamen gulam bana liya
 The rise of Modi is, therefore, India's first opportunity to leap into and connect to a millennium's past
 agar or dhristataa karen to iskaa sidhaa-sa arth ghadi or calendar ko bhootkaal main palatney kaa he
 This is a serious issue to be raised when the new government is taking its steps
 sansad kaa mahatvapurn satr shuru ho rahaa he
 This issue should be raised because it is a major issue, there is no trace of the group of undergraduate devotees coming out of Dinanath Batra Vidyapeeth
 deenanath batra ko akelaa divaana or wendi donigar kii vidwata kaa hatyara maanakar use andekha kar dena morrkhtaa hogi
 Batra is a symbol of new power in our political and intellectual thought, even if it is the power of archaic thinking
 bhartiya janata party ke maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay par unke shikanje ko saaf dekha ja saktaa he
 This week saw a new trend in New Delhi when German Ambassador Michael Steiner met with Batra and argued to reduce his opposition to German language studies in central schools
 unke tamaam rajanyik kaushal ke baavjood jeet sanskrit kii hui
 At this time, there was a need to interfere lightly on behalf of the modernist Prime Minister
 ve kah sakate the ki sanskrit banaam german vivaad kii kya jarurat he? sanskrit hamaari uttam shastreey bhashaa he or use sabake liye aakarshak banaaya janaa chahie tathaa pandit ji kii dharna se mukt karaayaa janaa chahie
 And why only German? The people of India should be allowed to choose any of several important foreign languages including French, Spanish and Mandarin
 aaj duniya vaishvik ho chuki he or bharat vaishvik ho rahaa he
 Modi is the most traveled Prime Minister after Nehru
 ab saanskrithik or bhashaayi asuraksha kii puraani khandakon kii gaharaai main utarane kaa samay nahin he
 Today's young India is eager to get out of the country and embrace the world in the same way that Modi employs world leaders
 (vaise haryana sarkaar shiksha vyavastha ko aadhunik karne ke liye batra kii salaah lene kaa faisla kar chuki he)
 This debate is not about any one individual but about the mental state, in which logic has been confused with tradition, curiosity with mythology
 yah sthiti or jatil ho jaati he
 In 2001, i also went to Iran in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's convoy along with many senior journalists
 yah yatra har tarah se upyogi thi kyonki ham sab parasipolis naam ke us pracheen shahar tak gaye the jise sikandar mahaan ne tabah kar diya tha
 We were all wandering in those ruins when only an intellectual thinker of the RSS with us started giving us knowledge of history
 unka kahana tha ki dekho, sikandar kitna dusht tha
 He came to do the same thing in India
 lekin hindu raja poras ne use haraa diya, jiskaa asli naam paurush tha
 He fled India in fear, his army collapsed and he eventually died
 tab maine rokane kii koshish karte hue kaha ki itihaas to isse ekadam alag he, par mujhe darkinar kar diya gaya
 i have more intelligent friends and pundits of strategic subjects
 rajamohan ne meraa kandhaa thapthapaayaa or bole, inase bahes mat karo, ye itihaas ko aasthaa se ulajh dete hai
 Today i often remember this thing of his
 bharat main itihaas lambey samay se rajnatik or vaicharik footbal ho chuki he
 Therefore, you can understand why RSS thinkers are so desperate to take revenge on leftist thinkers
 dashakon tak haaavee rahe vampanthi vichaarkon ne itihaas main apni soch thunskar anek dharmanirpeksh vikrutiyaan bhari hai
 Yet history can afford sensible disagreements and debate
 bhale hi yah bahes aksar is tarah bemaani ho ki tajmahal kabhi hindu mandir tha
 But a big challenge arises when not only history, science is also entangled with faith
 isi uljhaav ne is hafte mere stambh kii prerana di he
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh collected more headlines than Modi, who visited Australia last week, in a speech saying that physicist Werner Heisenberg derived his famous uncertainty principle from the Vedas
 (yah or baat he ki unke mantralay ke kuch ati utsaahi khabarchiyon ne hejanberg kaa naam bhi nahin suna tha or press vijyapti main ijanhower kaa anischitata kaa siddhant likh diya)
 This is a little crooked thinking
 yah soch us vyapak or lambey samay se chali aa rahi puranic soch se milti-julati he ki pashchimi duniya aaj jo kuch bhi khoj rahi he, use vaidic kaal main viksit kiya ja chukaa tha
 Lord Pushpak, along with Lord Rama, Sita and Lakshmana, returned to Ayodhya from Lanka, that is, there were airplanes in that period too
 aaj ham ek se adhik hathiyaar le jane main sakasham isibm kii baat karen yaa dushman ke missile ko rokane vaale patriot missile kii yaa phir stritegic dephence inishiative kii, to lanka ke yuddh main ram or ravan ke shakti baan kya the? yaa arjuna ne kauravon par koun se baanon kii varsha kii thi? ramanand sagar ne apane antaheen televijan dharawahikon main is samrudh viraasat ko yaad dilaane ke liye bahut mehnat kii thi
 What difference does it make that today we cannot even make a reliable rifle for our soldiers
 is baat se katai inkaar nahin he ki hamaare veda, upanishad or ramayana tathaa mahabharat jaise granth vastav main pracheen hai or unamem adbhut kalpana or vilakshan gyaan miltaa he
 We may have imagined machine flight long before the time when our intellectual rivals of Greece and Rome were imagining flying from Icarus to the Phoenix with large wings of birds on humans
 yah sach he ki aryabhatta or unke shishyon ne khagol kii anek sachaaiyon or vichaaron kii kalpana kii, un par charchaa kii or unka vivaran rakhaa
 For these truths many scholars of Europe were burned or poisoned after hundreds of years
 ho saktaa he, kisi ne plastic surgery, insaan main pashu ke angon ke pratiropan, stem cell anusandhan, kiraye kii kokh jaisi chizon kii bhi kalpana kar lee ho
 But to say that we already had all this is not only ridiculous but also dangerous
 hamaara desh paramparaon or andhvishwaason main duba desh he
 Our missile scientists worship and break coconuts before testing the new Agni missile
 hamaare antariksh vigyaani mangalayan ko ravaanaa karne se pehle uskaa model tirupati le jaakar bhagwaan balaji kaa aashirwad lete hai
 Now if we tell them that what we had a millennium ago, they are just copying or reversing that engineering then it would be dangerous, because many of them would not even object to it
 bhavishya kii raah par badhate hue modi ke liye yah badi chunauti he
 He has a modern and technical mind
 magar ve swayan or unhen aage oochhaalane vaali vaicharik tathaa saanskrithik takatein vaibhavshaalee ateet kaa bhram paale hue hai
 The search for ancient mythology and modern new discoveries in ancient texts cannot go on simultaneously
 modi ko agar nehru kii soch se koi ek sikh lene kii jarurat he to vah he vaigyanik yatharth
 PS: In Pune, at the feet of Aryabhatta - i was fortunate to spend a few hours with Professor Jayant Narlikar last week
 ve aaj bhi bharat ke ek pramukh khagol bhautik vigyaani hai or big-baing siddhant par sawaal uthaane vaale hoyal-narlikar siddhant ke sah-rachanaakaar hai
 He has built the Inter University Center for Astronomy and Astro Physics (IUCAA) at the University of Pune and his garden has huge statues of the greatest scientists like Newton, Einstein, Galileo and most importantly Aryabhatta
 narlikar kii ginati bharat ke sabase bahadur or sabase moti chamadi vaale tarkshastriyon main hoti he
 At the age of 76, his eyes start flashing as soon as any superstition and ancient beliefs are mentioned
 unhen sabase zyada khiz tabhi hoti he jab log unke vigyaan ko jyotish samajhne kii bhul karte hai
 In Pune's phone directory, their institute IUCAA is generally referred to as the center of astrology
 apni baat sabit karne ke liye unhone bataaya ki unhone sabase pratibhavan or safal vidhyaarthiyon tathaa maansik rup se baadhit bacchon kii saikadon kundaliyaan ekatra kin or unhen bharat ke sabase nami jyotishiyon ko baanchane ko diya
 Not a single one of them could identify it correctly
 narlikar kaa kahana he ki jyotish bakawaas he or use vaidic bataanaa sachaai se khilwaad he
 He says that there was no astrology in the Vedic tradition, no Mars used to signify marriage, no Jupiter rained grace and no Saturn spoiled the game and even offered mustard oil and cash every Saturday to celebrate it
 There was no need
 unka kahana he ki yah sab yunaan se aayaa he
 Alexander had also brought many learned men in his army
 unamem se kuch yaheen rah gaye or jyotish kaa prachaar karne lage
 Our forefathers, Hindus or non-hindus, Porus or Paurashas, took him in arms
 isliye or chaahe jo bhi ho, kam-se-kam apane sitaron kii gardish ke liye hamen apane vedon ko dosha nahin dena chahie
 The Samajwadi Party and BJP leader Vinay Katiyar have attacked Mulayam Singh Yadav over the conflict in the clan
 unhone kaha he ki sapa main jo kuch ho rahaa he, use dekhakar lag rahaa he ki mulaayam singh kii haalat bhishma pitamah jaisi he
 Nobody is listening to them

 The channel took a big decision, Kapil's show will be closed next month
 1) With Sunil Grover in the controversy show, he had the same status as Sunil Grover himself

 Former ISRO chief g Madhavan Nair rejected the suggestion that the controversial Antrix Dewas deal that was scrapped was a scam
 unhone is baat ko doharaaya ki sarkari khajaane ko baari nuksaan kaa akalan puri tarah galat he
 He said that people are getting spectrum from being leased to satellite transponders
 unhone kaha ki donon bhinn mudde hai
 ISRO deals only with leasing of transponders

 nair ne kaha ki yadi isro kisi parichaalak ko transponder detaa he to vah bhartiya upmahadweep main doorsanchaar vibhaag se anumati mili bina aplinking, downalinking or biming nahin kar sakate

 yadi main (isro) do transpondaron kii aapurti se 20 hajaar karod rupee hasil kar saktaa hum to isro ko sarkaar se koi sahyog lene kii kya jarurat he

 The first proposal was sent from here (dos)

 Nair said that this was never heard before
 unhone kaha, ‘isamen koi ghotaalaa shaamil nahin hai
 He noted that when people heard the spectrum, they called it a scam and what? purv isro pramukh ne yah baat jor dekar kahi ki vah devas kaa bachaav nahin kar rahe hai
 'I have nothing to do with this
 ’ nair ne kaha, ‘entrix kaa kisi bhi tarah spectrum se lenadena nahin he
 We gave them a device (transponder) to send signals to space
 ’ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki teen anya prakhyat vaigyanik jinhen unke saath sarkari naukariyon ko hasil karne se roak diya gaya he, buree tarah se khinn hai or mahasoos kar rahe hai ki unke saath puri tarah se anyaay kiya gaya he

 Dabur has claimed that all the legal aspects have been taken into account and proper tax has also been paid
 company ne kaha he ki yah behad durbhagyapurna he ki videsh main acount rakhane vaale har shaks ko ek hi najar se dekha ja rahaa he
 The company has said that at present Pradeep Burman has no connection with Dabur and does not hold any position in Dabur India Limited
 modi main himmat he to saare naam bataaen: congresssutra bataa rahe hanvideshi bainkon main khataadharakon main jin netaaon ke naam hai, unke maamalon main abhi saboot jutaaye ja rahe hai
 Those names can also be disclosed to the court after a thorough investigation in this regard
 abhi jo teen naam saamne aa rahe hai unhen yah sabit karnaa hoga ki videshi bainkon main unhone jo paisa rakhaa he, vah kaala dhan nahin he or is maamle main arabiai ke dishanirdeshon kii avhelnaa nahin kii gai he
 The Congress has counter-attacked the BJP after three names surfaced
 congress ne kaha he ki isse arun jetali kaa vah daawa jhootha sabit hota he jisamen vah kah rahe the kinaam saamne aane ke baad congress sharmaa jaaegi
 At the same time, party general secretary Digvijay Singh has said that if BJP, Narendra Modi and Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat have courage, then make the names of all black money holders public
 videshi bank main simit paisa rakhane kii he ijajatagauratlab he ki centre sarkaar ne pehle kaha tha ki jin videshi bainkon ke acounts kii jaanch inakam tex lau ke tahat shuru nahin kii gai he un naamon kaa khulaasa nahin hoga
 The government feels that disclosing the names without starting an investigation into the illegality in the black money case would be a violation of the right to privacy wherein according to RBI rules any Indian has the right to legitimately get 1 lakh in foreign bank every year

 supreme court ke senior vakil ram jethmalani kii yachika par court ne sarkaar ko nirdesh diya tha ki vah beyimaani se videshi bainkon main jamaa kiye gaye bhartiya paison ko waapas laane ke liye ucch stareey task force gathit kare
 On the court's order, the then UPA government had disclosed to Jethmalani the names of Indians whose accounts were in the Liechtenstein bank and the German government provided the information under the double taxation avoidance agreement
 sarkaar ne pehle di thi samjhaute kii duhayiis maamle main narendra modi sarkaar ne apane pehle halafname main supreme court se kaha tha ki germany kii aapattiyon ke kaaran vah un bharatiyon ke naamon khulaasa tab tak nahin kar sakati he jab tak ki unke khilaaf vittiya kanoon ke tahat aniyamitata kii jaanch shuru nahin ho jaati
 Disclosing the names earlier would violate the terms of the bilateral agreement
 isamen kaha gaya he ki bharat sarkaar, america samet duusare deshon se kuch mahatvapurn dohare karadhaan bachaav samjhaute main lagi he
 The court has been told that only through these treaties can the source of information related to black money of Indians deposited in foreign banks be accessed
 sarkaar ne court se kaha tha ki yadi ham samjhauton ke karaaron kaa ulanghan karte hai to videshi bainkon main bharatiyon dwaara chhupaakar rakhe gaye paison se jude data duusare desh saajha karne se inkaar kar denge
 The central government has assured the court through this affidavit that it is ready to disclose the names of Indians whose foreign bank accounts have been recommended for investigation
 jethmalani ne sarkaar ke is stand par kadi aapatti jataai thi
 He said that the government wants to keep everything a secret
 unhone dohare karadhaan bachaav samjhaute ke bare main kaha tha kiyah sab kuch chupaane kii chaal he
 This decision of the government was also condemned by the Congress

 Amid controversies that have arisen due to alleged pro-separatist moves by the Jammu and Kashmir government, BJP chief Amit Shah has said that his party will not compromise on national interests and may break its alliance with the PDP if the Kashmir issue is not resolved
 apane vidhansabha kshetra naranpura main bijepi kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue shah ne kaha, 'desh kii janata ne hamen bhagwaan shiv kii tarah aashirwad diya he or hamen bahut badi jimmedaari saunpi he
 The BJP will never compromise national interests only to remain in power in Jammu and Kashmir
 'shah ne kaha, 'jammu-kashmir main sarkaar keval kashmir mudde ko sulajhane ke liye gathit kii gai thi or mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki ham is mudde kaa samaadhaan khoj lenge
 If the Kashmir issue is not resolved, no party can stop the workers from coming out of the coalition government
 'shah ne yah bhi kaha ki bijepi kaaryakartaaon ko janata ke paas jaakar yah sandesh dena chahie ki party rashtriya hiton se samjhauta nahin karegi
 However BJP spokesperson Hashard Patel said that Shah had only said that national interests were the priority of the party and he had apparently never said anything about breaking the bjp's alliance with PDP
 patel ne kaha, 'amit shah ne keval yah kaha tha ki rashtriya hit hamaari praathamikta hai or bijepi jammu kashmir kii dharti par koi raashtra virdohi gatividhi bardaasht nahin karegi

 External Affairs Minister SM Krishna on Monday pulled up his junior minister Shashi Tharoor for publicly questioning the new visa rules
 unhone kaha ki agar unka koi najariya tha to usapar saarvajanik taur par charchaa kiye jane kii bajaay sarkaar kii ‘chaharadivari’ ke bheetar charchaa kii jaani chahie
 The government made it clear that it would not reconsider the new rules

 Krishna made this comment when asked about the opinions expressed by Tharoor about the new visa rules on social networking site Twitter
 krishna ne is baat ko rekhaankit kiya ki sarkaar kaa kaam behad mahatvapurn he or ise ‘us rup main kiya janaa he, jaisaa ham faisla karenge

 The Ministry of Tourism rejected Tharoor's concerns about tourism

 The Naxalites do not want the railway line to be considered the backbone of the railway line, the naxalites are constantly stuck in the construction of this railway line
 ve nahin chaahate ki bastar main rail suvidhaon kaa kisi bhi surat main vistaar ho
 Naxalite tracks have been uprooted many times

 At present, neither Facebook nor Oculus has provided any information about this incident

 In such a situation how a common user will ensure their security on social media
 bada sawaal yah bhi he ki jab security orprivesi kaa halaava dene valiin soshal media companiyon ke maalik hi sicyor nahin he, to aam yugers apni security ko lekar chintit na ho aisa mushkil he
 After a long time there was a lot of hustle in Gaushala
 varanaa viraani to rosemara kii baat thi
 The cows had left the place to visit
 bhed bakriyaan or murge to udhar kaa rasta hi bhul chuke the
 Today's gathering was too much
 kah sakate he ki jorge orvel ke animal farm jaisaa jeevant maahaul tha
 Animals have their own separate tongue which they understand among themselves
 insaanon kii baaten samajhane ke liye unhen bhi interprator kii jarurat hoti he or iske liye ve nanhaku kii madad lete hai
 Nanhku is the caretaker of Gaushala appointed by the panchayat
 nanhaku ne apane dada se jaanwaron kii boli or unhen apni baat kaise samajhaaii jaae ye sab sikh rakhaa he
 Now Nanhku gives updates to the animals of the cowshed
 vahi bataata he ki din kii badi khabar kya he? or twitor par par kya trend kar rahaa he? jab nanhaku ne unhen khabar di thi ki # beefban twitor par duusare din bhi number van par trend kar rahaa he to ek apaat baithak bulaai gai
 It is a ruins outside the village of Gaushala, with one end adjoining the forest
 nanhaku kii maane to uske dada ke jamaane main aas paas ke jaanavar har roj vahaan jutate the
 Nanhku's grandfather then used to tell him about human tales and political activities
 jaanwaron kii sabase zyada dilchaspee raajnneeti main thi
 His grandfather told this to Nanhku
 natthu bakre ne sabase pehle manch sambhala
 "brother agreed
 gaayon ke to achche din aa gaye
 "dudhni cow was also smiling sitting in the crowd
 natthu kii baat par usne palken jhapaka kar hami bhar di
 After this, Mittu Rat raised his head and roamed the neck and said, "when a person like Manjhi can order in his province, why Manjhi could not do it
 insaanon ke liye to unhone wo sab kiya jo kar sakate the kya sapane main bhi unhen hamaara khyaal nahin aayaa
 "" Yes, though he used to tell very proudly that he has eaten too many rats, "putu Rat, sitting near Mittu, added," Do humans miss us while eating or on food
 " baad main unhen sab bhul jaataa he
 "when humans forget their own people, it is meaningless for us to expect animals," Mittu continued
 natthu phir shuru ho gaye, "bhai ye baat to ab puri tarah saaf ho chuki he ki is gole par thappe ke saath koi paidaa nahin hota
 As much as it applies to humans, it applies to animals as well
 ""ye insaan hi hai jo khud kii tarah ham jaanwaron ko bhi baant die hai
 Rather, we have framed worse
 unhone apane liye to kam se kam ek lakeer khinch lee he
 From where they stood, their line also starts and ends many times, ”munna Murghe further added to Nathu
 "koun baccha kis dharm or jati kaa kehalaayegaa ye to ve paidaa hote hi tay kar lete hai
 But our caste and religion is fixed at the time of death
 chaaku chalane se pehle tak hamen maaloom nahin hota ki hamaara majahab kya he?" natthu ne munna kii baat ko aage badhaayaa, "ham jivan bhar secular bane rahete hai
 Nobody asks or we are kept secular for our politics
 agar chaaku se halaal kiya gaya to hamaara majahab alag ho jaataa he - or chaaku ne jhatka de diya to kisi or majahab ke khate main registration ho jaataa he
 "sheep was the largest number among the audience
 phir bhi sab ke sab shant baithe hue the
 Ex-officio chairman Prasad Bhansa was presiding over the meeting
 unke bagal main kumari bhens baithi hui thim
 He was most angry with 'aap' and 'hum'
 aap yani aam aadmi party netaa arvind kejariwal or ham yani hindustan avam morcha ke netaa jithan ram maanjhi se
 He expected Kejriwal to think that the person who thinks about the common man will definitely think about animals
 lekin dilli chunaavon main jab aap ke menifesto main 70 main se ek bhi khaane main unhen apane laayak kuch bhi nahin dikhaa to ve bade niraash hue
 In the same way, he hoped that when Jitan Ram Manjhi became the Chief Minister, at least he would issue a mandate to include him among the Mahadalits
 jab maanjhi ne bhi aisa nahin kiya to unka dil tut gaya
 He was very disappointed
 sabhi jaanavar dhyaan se sun rahe the isliye munna or natthu kii aawaaj tej hoti ja rahi thi
 "be it Holi, Diwali, New Year or any other reason for celebration, we are bound to cut
 hamaara koi sensos nahin hota
 It is possible that the number of our births and cuts is so much that the census is not a matter of anyone's ability
 to is tarah se to ham bahusankhyak hue
 But far from the status of minority, we do not fall into the Dalit category either
 ""bihar main nitish kumaar ne jab mahadalit ayog banaaya tha to laga ab din bahurenge
 But they did nothing
 " "maanjhi se to hame itani ummid thi ki kya kahen
 It seemed that Manjhi, we would at least include chickens and goats in Mahadalit
 lekin wo bhi dagaa de gaye
 If Manjhi had put us in the Mahadalit category, then who could have stopped him from becoming the next Chief Minister? "" We would have sought votes for Manjhi in November itself
 ghaas-phoos khaanevaalon kii baat chhod bhi den to murga khaanevaalon kii taadaad kam he kya? ham dharna dete pradarshan karte? band kii kol dete
 Would anyone have a chance to ignore us? log band nahin karte to jabaran band kara dete
 "the talk was going on and there was no visible result
 phir kaalu bhed khadey hokar bole, "bhai samasyaayein to anginat hai kya hamaare paas inkaa koi samaadhaan bhi he
 "teetri Bakri endorsed Kalu's talk
 aakhir main sarv sammati se prastaav paarit hua ki november main hone ja rahe chunaav main unki party apane boote chunaav ladegi
 Soon a typical native name of the party will be named and formally applied to the Election Commission
 tay hua ki party naam aisa rakhaa jayega ki media use na to 'aap' bole na 'ham'
 The election symbol will be either a sketch of a human face or a knife
 isi ke saath sab log apni apni raah pakad liye
 Some are towards the village and some to the forest
 dudhani vahiin baithi rahi
 He hopes that now the cowshed will be buzzing everyday

 For the century innings, he faced 148 balls and hit nine fours

 Pujara, 28, has scored this century after 14 innings
 pichhlaa shatak (145* ran) unhone srilanka ke khilaaf colombo main 28 agast 2015 ko banaaya tha
 After this, though Pujara managed to score some half-centuries, his identity of playing big innings was becoming 'lost'
 yahi kaaran rahaa ki kuch maichon main unhen plaing ilevan se baahar bhi hona padaa
 Pujara did not feature in the XI in Team India's tour of Bangladesh tour
 srilanka daure par do test maichon main bhi unhen baahar baithna padaa
 Not only this, even in a test of the four-match series against West Indies, Pujara could not find a place in the team

 He also had to sit out in two Test matches on the Sri Lanka tour
 yahi nahin, westeindies ke khilaaf chaar maichon kii siries ke ek test main bhi pujaara ko team main jagah nahin mil saki
 At this time it seemed that Pujara, Captain and team management were losing their confidence and Rohit Sharma was being paid attention to
 tippaniyan The test series against West Indies on the grounds there was a 'warning alarm' for Pujara
 is siries ke chaar main se teen test main pujaara ko khilne kaa mauka mila
 He could not do much in these matches as well and only managed 62 runs in 31 innings
 is dauraan 46 unka sarvaadhik score rahaa
 However, this 'drought' of runs was taken by Pujara as a challenge
 pink ball se dudhia roshni main khele jane vaale khele dalip trophy ke maichon main ve utre or apana form waapas paaya
 In this important competition, he achieved a major achievement by scoring a double century against India Red

 This double century brought Pujara's confidence of batting back

 With a great performance against the Kiwi team, they have shown that they are not ready to lose their place easily in the playing eleven

 While the ongoing tussle between the Central Reserve Bank and the Central Government was curbed by the recent meeting of the Reserve Bank Board, on Tuesday, Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel was asked several questions by members of the Parliamentary Standing Committee
 ek ghante se adhik samay tak chale is sawaal jawaab main mana ja rahaa he ki urjit patel ne kendriya bank or sarkaar ke bich kisi vivaadit mudde ko nahin uthaaya
 While answering most of the questions raised on the state of the economy, Urjit Patel has asked to answer most of the contentious questions in writing in 10 days
 sutron ke mutabik sansad kii 31 sadasyeey standing cameti on finance ne is mulaakaat main ek darjan se adhik sawaal daage
 However, Urjit Patel answered the same questions which were directly related to the economy
 patel ne aise kisi sawaal kaa jawaab nahin diya jisase donon kendriya bank or kendra sarkaar ke bich ek baar phir takaraav kii sthiti paidaa ho
 Demonetisation was first questioned among the members of the parliamentary committee
 samiti main maujuud saansadon ne jaananaa chaha ki aakhir notebandi kaa kya asar arthvyavastha par pad rahaa he or kis had tak desh ke gramin ilaakon main kisaanon ko iskaa khamiyaja uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 While giving a very careful answer to this complex question, Patel told the committee that the impact of the demonetization decision was only momentary and now the economy has recovered from its ill effects
 nehru indira rahe naakaam, kya PM Modi banaaenge bharat ko P-6?standing cameti on finance kaa doosraa ahm sawaal vaishvik arthvyavastha kii sthiti par tha
 The committee wanted to know how the current state of the global economy is and what is the sign for India in that situation
 is ahm sawaal ke jawaab main patel ne bataaya ki vaishvik arthvyavastha kachche tel kii keemton or duniya kii badi arthvyavasthaaon ke bich jari trade war ke dabaav main he
 Therefore, it is very important for India in the current global situation that the prices of crude oil should remain at a low level, thereby benefiting the economy
 is mulaakaat ke dauraan sansadeey samiti ke sadasyon ne agle ahm sawaal arabiai kii swaittata, kendra sarkaar dwaara arabiai act ke section 7 ke istemaal or arabiai ke rigerv khajaane se sarkaar ko paise die jane par kendrit rahe
 Not giving any immediate answer to these three questions, Urjit Patel asked for a written reply in 10 days time from the Parliamentary Committee
 vahiin sansadeey samiti main kuch sadasyon ke sawaal sidhe taur par kendra sarkaar or kendriya bank ke bich uthe vivaad par rahe
 The parliamentary committee wanted to know why the communication between the central government and it was weakened
 is sawaal ke jawaab main bhi patel ne chuppi saadh lee or likhit taur par apana paksh rakhane kii baat kahi
 Apart from this, the members questioned Patel on the Basel Three Capital Addiction of Banks
 is sawaal ke jawaab main patel ne kaha ki bharat is vaishvik sandhi ko puri tarah lagu karne kaa pakshdhar he haalanki iske vistrut jawaab ke liye samiti ne patel ko 10 se 15 din kaa samay diya
 During this meeting, members raised an important question on the current status of npas of banks
 vahiin kuch sadasyon ne yah bhi jaananaa chaha ki kya kendriya bank kuch bade karjadaaron kaa naam saajha karne ke liye taiyaar he
 Sources have claimed that Patel replied that he was ready to share the list of borrowers
 haalanki enpie kii maujuuda sthiti par patel ne kaha ki philhal bainkon kaa enpie us str par nahin he ki kisi tarah kii khatre kii ghanti sunai de

 Standard SMS Charges Applicable ” The Lokpal Bill has been introduced in the Rajya Sabha amidst all kinds of speculation
 ve narayansami ne ise sadan main pesh kiya
 With the introduction of the much awaited Lokpal bill, discussions are going on
 kis party ne is bill ko lekar kya ranneeti apana rakhi he, iskaa khulaasa hone main ab zyada vilamb nahin he
 It is for the government to pass the Lokpal bill in Rajya Sabha because the government does not have a two-thirds majority
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki agar rajyasabha main bill nahin hua paas to sansad kaa saajha satr bulaayaa jayega
 On the other hand, Sonia Gandhi is angry at the Lokpal not getting constitutional status in the Lok Sabha
 unhone kaha, ‘bijepi kii vajah se nahin mila lokapal ko darja, desh ke saamne aayaa vipaksh kaa asli cheharaa
 The BJP hit back at Sonia Gandhi, saying, "not getting the Lokpal constitutional status is a defeat for the government
" bijepi ne savaala uthaaya he ki congress ke khud apane saansad hi kyon hue voting ke dauraan gaayab
 Also, BJP has said that the party will now come to the Rajya Sabha with 21 amendment proposals
 loksabhaa main sarkaar kii fajihat par congress alaakaman bhadkaa
 a show cause notice has been issued to all mps of the missing party during voting
 hvip ke baavjood gaiyrhaazir rahane ke khilaaf congress haikaman karrwai karne kaa mood bana rahaa he
 But the passage of the Lokpal Bill in the Rajya Sabha is showing uncertainty as the Trinamool Congress has demanded a significant change in the bill passed in the Lok Sabha, which is complicating the game of statistics in the House
 243 sadasyeey upari sadan main trinmul congress ke chah sadsy hai
 The Congress and its allies do not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha
 trinmul congress chaahati he ki loksabhaa main paarit vidheyak main se rajyon dwaara lokayuktaon ke gathan sambandhi praavdhaan ko hataa diya jaae
 If the government accepts the amendment, the bill will have to be sent to the Lok Sabha again or a joint session of Parliament will be called for its approval
 samprag ke sankatmochak evam vitt mantri pranav mukherjee ne sahyogi trinmul congress ke netaaon se vaarta kii lekin trinmul ne vidheyak ke praavdhaanon par kadi aapatti jataai
 The party believes that the appointment of Lokayuktas in the states is an infringement of their rights
 trinmul congress ke netaa mukul raay or sandip bandopadhyaay ne mukherjee se mulaakaat kii jiske baad raay ne kaha ki sarkaar ke liye samasya utpann karne kaa sawaal hi khadaa nahin hota
 After Mukherjee possibly denied any further amendment, the Trinamool Congress has asked for amendments related to the provision to remove Lokayuktas
 243 sadasyeey rajyasabha main samprag ke congress evam anya sahyogiyon kii sankhya 94 he
 It will now have to depend on eight nominated members and ten mps of independents and smaller parties
 lokapal or lokayukta vidheyak ke liye 122 sadasyon ke saamaanya bahumat kii jarurat he
 But the backdoor strategy is probably that BSP (18), Samajwadi Party (six) and RJD (four), supporting parties from outside, are absent
 unki anupasthiti se sadan kii kul sankhya main kami aa jaaegi or 215 sadasyon ke sadan main 108 ke bahumat kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 The BJP, which played a major role in bringing down the bill giving constitutional status to the Lokpal, indicated that it was against voting on the current form of the bill
 rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne lokapal vidheyak ke praavdhaanon par kaha ki yah sangheey dhaanche kaa ulanghan he or jor diya ki sansad us vidheyak ko paarit nahin kar sakati he jiske bare main vah jaanati he ki yah samvidhan ke khilaaf he
 The party can bring amendments under Article 252 of the Constitution to make provisions for the formation of Lokayuktas, the appointment and removal of Lokpal and pressure to bring the CBI under its ambit
 bhaajapa ne daawa kiya ki sarkaar ke paas upree sadan main apekshit sankhya nahin he
 However, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh hoped that the Rajya Sabha would pass the bill and he was as confident as anyone could be
 samvaadadaataaon se baat karte hue sansadeey maamalon ke mantri pawan kumaar bansal ne kaha, ‘main sirf yahi kah saktaa hum ki ham aashwast hai ki vidheyak paas karaane ke liye hamaare paas sankhya he
 'the managers of the government hope that even if the situation is very bad, 114 votes will be taken in favor of the bill in the 216-member house
 rajyasabha main congress ke 71 sadsy, jabaki iske sahyogi dramuk ke saat, trinmul congress ke chah, rakanpa ke saat, neshnal conference ke do or ralod kaa ek sadsy he
 This number is 94
 party ko kuch ek sadasyon vaali partiyon, kuch nirdaliyon evam anya kaa bhi samarthan hasil he
 The total number of independents and others is six while the number of nominated members is eight
 do namit sadasyon manishankar ayyar or balachandra mungekar congress main shaamil ho chuke hai
 The opposition has 51 members of the BJP, 19 from the Left parties, eight from the JD-U, six from the BJD, five from the AIADMK, four each from the TDP and Shiv Sena, three from the Akali Dal and two from the AGP

 pehle khabar ai thi ki actor vishaal singh kii is sho kii shooting ke dauraan apni eks se ladaai ho gai he or ab khabar he ki actress shraddha aryaa apni fees se khush nahin hai
 According to Pinkvilla's news, Shraddha Arya has problems with the amount received by actress Anita Hasanandani
 mana ja rahaa he ki anitha ko nach baliye 9 ke ek episod ke liye 30 lakh rupee die ja rahe hai
 At the same time, Shraddha is getting less money than Anita

 Shraddha wanted to get the same amount of fees as Anita as she herself is the star of a hit show and needs to run more between her show and work
 itnaa hi nahin shraddha is sho main apane eks boyfriend ke saath aa rahi hai, jabaki anitha isamen apane pati rohit reddy sang najar aaengi
 Therefore, Shraddha feels that she should get more money
 khabar ye bhi he ki isi kaaran se shraddha ne haal hi main hue nach baliye 9 ke grand launch main shirkat nahin kii thi

 jab kendriya swasthya mantri dow
 On June 16, Harshvardhan was talking to doctors while looking at medical reports in ward number 3 of the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH), Muzaffarpur, at the same time when 4-year-old Nisha died
 doctoron ne use bachaane kii koshishen kin, par uski saans nahin lauti
 She was one of the deaths from Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) that day in Muzaffarpur, Bihar
 ise 'chamaki bukhaar' bhi kaha ja rahaa he
 More than 150 children have died in the state so far
 eskeems main eies peedit kai bacchon ke haath unhen aane vaale jhatkon se akad gaye hai
 They are unable to keep their eyes somewhere and many are unable to speak, nor are they able to open their eyes
 roshni, aawaaj or chune se bhi unhen takalif hoti he
 The hospital is reverberating with the heartache of children and their families
 us vakt jab nisha ke maa-baap dahaaden maar-maar kar ro rahe the, kendriya swasthya rajyamantri ashvini choube or bihar ke swasthya mantri mangal pandey ke saath harshavardhan ne anya biimaar bacchon ke parijanon se poochna shuru kar diya ki aspataal main vyavasthaaen thik-thaak hai yaa nahin
 Meanwhile, another 5-year-old girl Neetu died in the same ward
 kuch hi minuton ke bheetar hui do maut se sthiti kii bhayavahata ujagar ho gai or isane harshavardhan ko stabdh kar diya
 The doctors there also looked helpless
 ab tak is beemaari ke kaarnon kaa pataa nahin chal paaya he or doctor beemaari se ubhare lakshanon kaa ilaaj karne ke alaava kuch karne kii sthiti main nahin the
 The number of children suffering continued to grow day by day, making it difficult for the few doctors posted there
 asal main bebasii kii aisi sthitiyon se nipatane kii centre or rajya sarkaar kii taiyaariyon kaa abhaav or udaseenta bhi dikh jaati he
 This was not the first visit to Bihar for Harshvardhan
 unhone june, 2014 main bhi mujffarpur kaa daura kiya tha, jab rajya isi beemaari kii giraft main tha
 Then as Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan promised to build a 100-bed pediatric ICU at SKMCH
 unhone pados ke jilon main 10 bistaron vaale pediatric isiu ke nirmaan tathaa bhagalpur, betia, gaya, pavapuri tathaa nalanda main byrological diagnosticks laboratory sthapit karne kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 This time, even after visiting Muzaffarpur, Harshvardhan was seen repeating the same promise
 jaahir he, 100 bistaron vaale pediatric isiu or paanch byrological diagnosticks laboratory kii sthapana ke unke 2014 ke vaade par koi amal nahin hua
 Currently, SKMCH has a 50-bed pediatric ICU
 aspataal ke mukhya isiu ko bhi shishu rog vibhaag ke upyog ke liye parivartit kar diya gaya he
 But both these units are on different floors making it difficult to monitor them
 eskeems ke ek doctor kehete hai, ''ek hi manzil par 100-bistaron vaale isiu ke hone par sthitiyaan thodi behatar hotin
 But what can we say about the unfulfilled promises? ”officials say that most of the children under the age of the victim were below 10 years of age and died due to hypoglycemia in which blood sugar levels fall drastically and the body
 There is an imbalance of electrolytes
 rahasyamay beemaribar-baar ek nishchit avadhi main badi sankhya main bacchon kii jaan lene vaali is beemaari or uske kaarnon ko puri tarah khatm karne ke liye jameen-aasmaan ek kar diya janaa chahie tha
 But this did not appear to be happening in Bihar
 mujffarpur jile main sabase pehle 1994 main dikhi or tab se har saal kam pratirohak kshamta vaale kuposhit bacchon ko shikaar banane vaali is beemaari kii ab tak thik-thik pahchaan nahin ho saki he
 The disease remains mysterious to state health officials
 ve nirnaayak tareeke se nahin jaanate ki yah machharon kii ore se jaanwaron se aadamiyon tak failaayaa jane vaala japani anseflitis he yaa koi or incephelitis he jo dooshit pani se failata he
 Or, it is simple hypoglycemia caused by eating litchi in which the blood glucose level goes below normal
 is beemaari se peedit bachche aspataal main bukhaar or jhatkon ke lakshan ke saath pahunchate hai jahaan ve coma main chale jate hai or phir teji se maut aa jaati he
 Epidemiologist T
 of Christian Medical College, Vellore
 jaikab jon ne mujffarpur maamalon kii jaanch ke liye 2013 main bihar kaa daura kiya tha
 They found that this disease is related to malnourished children
 jon kii raay he ki kuposhit bachche aksar hypoglaysemia kaa shikaar ho jate hai kyonki ve aksar raat main khaanaa khaae bina so jate hai or lambey samay tak bhukhe rah jate hai
 a group of medical experts believe that it is also related to eating litchi on an empty stomach
 darasal, mujffarpur jila lichi utpaadan ke liye bhi mashhoor he

 prabhaat kumaar sinha kaa kahana he, ''lichi main emsipiji vish hote hai jo sharir main glucose ke sancharan ko baadhit karte hai
 The amount of safe glycogen in the liver of malnourished children is very low due to which their body is unable to use the glycogen present in the liver
 mastishk ko urja ke liye glucose kii jarurat hoti he par in bacchon ke sharir main vah nahin hota kyonki biimaar padane se pehle vaali raat main unhone lichi khai hoti he
 a sudden drop in glucose levels leads to seizures or tremors and in many cases death
 '' phir bhi, dow
 Prabhat says that the causes of AES can also have causes other than litchi
 ve bataate hai, ''iske liye sakshya-aadhaarit zyada gahan shodh kii jarurat he
 We have also come across cases in which children suffering from AES did not eat litchi
 iskaa kaaran koi vishaanu ho saktaa he or uski rokthaam ke liye koi tikaa tab tak nahin banaaya ja saktaa jab tak yah pataa na ho ki vah vishaanu koun sa he
 "so far, experts have tried to find out whether the children of Muzaffarpur are suffering from any virus or any poison or due to malnutrition, from urine samples to cerebrospinal kruloid and genetic studies present in the spine and brain
 Are made
 is beemaari se peedit 500 se adhik bacchon kaa ilaaj philhal mujffarpur ke eskeems or kejariwal nursing home main chal rahaa he
 The victims have been admitted on the basis of high fever and tremor symptoms
 har saal garib bachche iskaa shikaar hote hai
 Poverty of parents of children increases their chances of falling prey to it as most of them become vulnerable to the killer virus due to lack of proper food and malnutrition
 unki garibi ne hi shaayad adhikariyon ko taal-matol kaa ravaiya apnaane or do dashakon main bhi rog ke kaaran kaa pataa na laga paane ke baavjood kisi dand kaa bhaagi hone se bachane kaa mauka diya he
 a senior doctor in Muzaffarpur linked these symptoms to severe glucose deficiency and said that it is more effective in heat and humidity
 swasthya vibhaag ke ek adhikari bataate hai, ''garmi ke maheenon main jab yah rog paanv pasaartaa he to doctor marijon ke ilaaj main lag jate hai or mausam badalte hi iskaa prakope kam hone par ve ise bhul jate hai
 He gets attention of this disease again in the next summer when the disease strikes again
 ''or bhi buree baat yah ki is beemaari kaa kaaran pataa nahin hone kii vajah se swasthya adhikari isaki rokthaam ke liye kuch nahin karte
 It has taken the form of an epidemic, but in the name of intervention, care is being taken only after the disease
 naakaam swasthya vibhagais baar jab anseflitis kaa sankat pair failaa rahaa tha, rajya ke swasthya mantri mangal pandeya ek conference ko sambodhit karne canada gaye hue the
 It shows how wrong their priorities were and how apathetic and careless they were about the threat of AES
 aisa hi ravaiya unke vibhaag kaa he
 Apparently, health department officials have failed at many levels to prevent deaths of children
 medical visheshgyon kaa ek samooh maanata he ki eies ke kaarnon kaa thik-thik pataa na hone ke kaaran iskaa nishchit ilaaj bhale na uplabdh ho, phir bhi thodi duuradrushti or jaldi kiye gaye upayon se bahut se bacchon kii maut kaa kaaran banane vaali sharir main glucose kii kami ko to aasaani se roka ja saktaa tha
 Six years ago, it was discovered that malnourished children who eat litchi during the day and sleep without eating at night fall ill the next morning
 saal 2014 main chikitsakon ne biimaar bacchon main se 74 fisad kii jaan ek saadhaaran upaay se bachaai thi—unhone biimaar padane vaale bacchon ko chaar ghanton ke bheetar 10 fisadi dextros chadhaaya tha
 Had the government been proactive in this direction, this year, by making the parents of children easily aware of the disease prevention strategy, it could be ensured that no child could sleep without eating food at night
 doctoron ke ek anya samooh kaa kahana he ki raajnneetikon tathaa naukarshahon ke chunaav main vyast hone ke kaaran jaagrukta abhiyaan kii ore kisi kaa dhyaan hi nahin gaya
 When the next day of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's visit at SKMMCH will be started, on June 19, the death toll rose to 112 with the death of four more children from this 'brain fever'
 is beemaari se rajya ke 12 jilon ke 222 vikaas khand prabhavit hue hai
 The affected districts include Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, Shivahar and East Champaran in particular
 is baar ab tak mujffarpur main eies ke 534 maamle darj hue hai
 383 of them are undergoing treatment at SKMCH and 152 at Kejriwal Hospital
 purvi champaran main beete 20 dinon main eies ke 56 or japani anseflitis ke 2 marij chinhit kiye gaye hai
 Of them, 19 AES children have died
 jan swasthya visheshgyon ne pichley dashak main baar-baar chetavanee di thi ki kharaab naagarik evam jan swasthya seva dhaancha, kuposhan or rog kii pahchaan tathaa ilaaj main deree hi eies se hone vaali mauton main yogadan karne vaale pramukh kaarak hai
 But till now no improvement has been done about this
 mujffarpur ke daure ke samay nitish kumaar ne doctoron or swasthya adhikariyon ke saath ek samiksha baithak bhi kii or varisht adhikariyon ko nirdesh diya ki ve eskeems kii kshamta 600 se badha kar 2,500 bistaron kii karen
 He directed the officials to double the number of beds in the pediatric ICU of SKMCH
 eskeems main kul 31 bal rog visheshgy karyrat hai, jabaki aath anya visheshgyon ko duusare aspataalon se aakar kaarybhaar grahan karnaa he
 However, once again these announcements do not become mere promises

 The crores of land that Lalu's daughter got in charity, though there are many similarities between the two
 donon ne ek hi din yani 13 farvari 2014 ko apni-apni jameen argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav kii paanchavi beti hema ko daan di
 Hema Yadav's address is written on Rabri Devi Kasarkari residence 10 Circular Road
 donon ek duusare ke daanpatr ke gavaah bhi hai
 Not only this, both of them bought land on 29 March 2008 on the same day
 ye khulaasa bijepi ke varisht netaa or bihar ke purv upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne kiya
 Sushil Modi, while having a special conversation with the target of Laxman Lalu, said that a BPL card holder who had been allotted Indira accommodation, had donated land to Hema Yadav and just got the case that Hridayanand Chaudhary, a railway's laborer, also got 62 lakhs of land
 Donated to Hema Yadav
 ye to bihar kaa saubhaahgya he ki lalu-nitish ke rajya main bipiel card dhari ke paas bhi karodo kii sampatti he or keval sampatti hi nahi he balki itane daanveer karn he ki ye log karodo kii sampatti or muft main daan karne kii kshamta rakhte he
 The way to legalize the benami property, Hamodi said that it is a very clean mask, Lalan Chaudhary or Hridayananda Chaudhary does not even have a PAN number
 jo 62 lakh kii sampatti gift kar rahaa he uskaa pan number bhi nahi hona mukhauta hi to he
 These people have been used to write the land
 lalu prasad yadav jabrel mantrithe to khud parivaar ke sari zamin nahi likhva sakate the in ke naam par zamin likhva liya gaya or ab khud ko gift karvaa rahen he
 So people are adopting the same method of legalizing benami property, through this, they have used it as a way of white money, but Lalu ji does not know that benami law has been made by Narendra Modi's government and all that All land is benami property, it will be confiscated today or tomorrow
 naukari dene ke naam se likhavai gai jameenmodi ne kaha ki hridayanand choudhary railway main forth grad ke karmchaaree he or jab lalu prasad yadav rail mantri the to isko khalasi ke pad par naukari mili jo lalu ji ke krupa se lagi thi
 Lalan Singh and Shivanand Tiwari are the same people who were given jobs by Lalu ji and got land written in his name or land was written in his name and now he is getting it gifted
 lalu ji ne naukari ,emele or mantri pad dene aad main zamin likhva liya chaahe vah raghunatha jha, kanti singh, lalan choudhary , hridayanand choudhary yaa phir shiv prasad choudhary ho or mujhe lagata he ki yah shaayad hindustan kaa gineez book of record hoga ki kisi ek netaa ko ek darjan se zyada logon ne karodo kii sampatti daan kii ho
 The Central Government will get it done
 Modi says that Nitish ji will not get it done, i know but i am sure that the Central Government will get it done
 modi ne kaha ki mujhe ye bhi maaloom keelalu prasad yadavahi jawaab denge ki badale kii maamla se karwaai ho rahi he to zamin benami kharidenge aap or agar karwaai hui to chillaayenge kii,badale kii bhaavana se karwaai ho rahi he ye vipaksh kyon ekajute ho rahaa hai isliye ki apni sampatti ko bachaane ke liye chaahe wo mamata banerjee yaa mayawati ho yaa phir lalu yadav ho or argedy kii jo raily ho rahi he ye desh bachaao raily nahin he balki benami sampatti bachaao raily he isliye notebandi kaa virodh kar rahe the
