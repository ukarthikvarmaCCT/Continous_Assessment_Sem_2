 If crude oil, which trades up to $ 66, reaches $ 80, it will have an impact on both the government's import bill and trade deficit

 Tara opposes this
 usne kaha ki main apane dharm kaa paalan karuungi
 After this the period of torture started

 i am happy that the constant changes in GDP are positive
 jidipi ke aankade bataate hai ki log sahi kaam kar rahe hai
 GDP growth is also consistently up, as costs have come down
 3
 Competition in business is never a concern
 hundai or ford kaam nahin karengi agar bijness main phayda nahin hoga
 He clarified that banks cannot pay 6 percent interest on deposits by giving loans at four percent
 log kehete hai ki byaaj dar kam kar di jaae, lekin kya ve apana paisa 4 pratishat byaaj dar par jamaa karnaa chahenge, nahin
 Low interest rate is not a God-given right
 main yah kahana chahta hum ki ham bharat main laaparvaah nahin ho sakate
 We still have a lot to do
 4
 Rajan said that it would be wrong to pat your back and say that we are the best in the world
 main samajhataa hum ki koi bhi mantri aisa nahin kahegaa
 5
 ham ek aisa desh hai jo samuchit rup se vikaas kar rahaa he, lekin hamaari kshamtaaon ke anuroop hamen abhi bahut kuch karnaa he
 6
 jahaan tak mek in india par mere bayaan kii baat he, use galat pesh kiya gaya
 He said that i just wanted to say that when the world is going slow, Make in India will remain only in India at that time
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki mere nirnay analysis or salaah par hi aadhaarit hote hai
 7
 main vahiin karata hum jo meri samaj se sahi he
 There is a lot of hard work in my work and it is not a work of glamor
 8
 We listen to the government's opinion, but should not bow down to fulfill the intention of any party
 vittamantri arun jetali ke saath meri baatcheet bahut hi mithravat rahi he or ham donon ek-duusare kaa sammaan karte hai
 9
 yah aapako chaunkaayegaa lekin aaj tak vittamantri arun jetali ke saath meraa kisi bhi vishay par gambhir virodh nahin rahaa
 Will not say anything about the second term
 10
 i have long wanted to return to the field of education
 meraa antim padaav vichaaron kii duniya he
 11
 unhone kaha ki kai log kah rahe hai ki main jane vaala hum, lekin mere paas jo bhi samay he main usamen apana kaam kar rahaa hum
 12
 rajan kehete hai ki jab aapaki aalochana hoti he to uskaa doosraa pahalu bhi hota he
 Many unknown people have written letters to me
 meri unionon ne meraa samarthan kiya he
 There have been some allegations about which speaking it would be like accepting them
 13
 We cannot choose China and Turkey as a path of progress, my commentary on China was exaggerated

 15
 Media seeks news, good conversation is not news
 2
 Raghuram Rajan said that i am happy with the GDP score, one percent can be taken or given
 khush hum ki jidipi main lagaataar ho rahe badlaav positive hai
 GDP figures show that people are doing the right thing
 jidipi growth bhi lagaataar upar he, kyonki laagat kam hui he
 3
 bijness main pratispardhaa kabhi chintaa kii baat nahin hoti
 Hyundai and Ford will not work if the business does not benefit
 unhone saaf kiya ki bank chaar pratishat par lone dekar diposit par 6 pratishat byaaj nahin de sakate
 People say that the interest rate should be reduced, but would they like to deposit their money at 4 percent interest rate, no
 kam byaaj dar bhagwaan dwaara pradutt adhikaar nahin he
 i want to say that we cannot be careless in India
 hamen abhi bahut kuch karnaa he
 4
 rajan ne kaha ki yah galat hoga ki apni peeth thapthapaaen or kahen ki ham duniya main best hai
 i understand that no minister would say that
 5
 We are a country that is developing properly, but we still have a lot to do to suit our capabilities
 6

 New ideals are being set in the new year
 neenv to pichley saal ne hi daal di thi
 Some burns around Delhi are floating in the air
 giraane main jinako maharath he, unke dil to nahin jal rahe kyonki pathar jalataa nahin
 It is said that Shilajit is a sweat of stone
 shila par jeetne vaale ne bahuton ke talvon ke paseene nikaal die hai
 They are all in the world, how they too become common
 adarsh bana daalen
 Carve your name in the stone that established the new ideal
 paanch saal jinako bhrashtachar zaraa nahin saalaa, vah bhi maidan main kud gaye hai
 When the heat of Adarsh's investigation reached the old chief and ministers, then the commission of inquiry was offered
 adhyadesh faad dene vaale chiryuva netaa ne is inkaar ko cheer diya to naa haa main badal gai

 Rahiman water is free up to seven hundred liters on ash

 pardaa uthaa nahin he, garda dikhaa nahin hai
 Smelling near, smells of socialism
 kaiyon ko badboo bhi aati hogi par main to ise khushboo hi maanata hum
 Gumkaua Socialism
 marks dharm ko opium kehete the
 Religion considers Marx as poppy
 par donon kaa apana dharm he
 Socialism is a little here and there, and it is romantic
 sabko roti, sabko kapadaa, sabko makaan, sabko swasthya, sabko shiksha, sabko pani, sabko bijli
 Resist! How can anyone dare to oppose the general public, the supreme public
 ye chikne paat vaale honhaar viravaan siddhant jab yatharth ke khurdare dharaatal par utarate hai to unke arsh ke adarsh farsh par let jate hai
 This is what we have seen from Nehru to lalu-mulayam
 bhookha roti ke vaade kiye ja rahaa he
 How does one who does not produce electricity pay half the price? But not only did the announcements come from aap's Mukherwind, it was implemented
 sabhi khush hai ki bhai kamaal he
 If the government wants, it can make good use of government money
 garib to chhodie, amiron ko bhi muft pani de rahi he
 There is a saying in English: There is no free lunch
 muft kaa bhojan jaisi chiz nahin hoti
 No money is government
 jo muft kaa nahin he vah muft kii shakal main aae to akal zarur lagaaein kyonki vah zyada mahangaa padataa he
 For sixty years we waited for the panacea of socialism
 ghaav badhata gaya, bukhaar chadhataa gaya
 When we got tired of mimicking the bowl before the World Bank, then the pus of that pseudo socialism had to be ripped off
 sabko roti, sabko kapadaa, sabko makaan
 These ideals are not hollow
 ye khokhale tab hote hai jab khokhli vyavasthaaen inkaa phugga phulati hai
 No money, ran the beach market - ran
 sansadhano kaa nirmaan karne se pehle uskaa bantwaaraa
 Capitalism, in contrast, is the accumulation of resources
 donon vaadon ke apane vivaad hai
 It is not possible to meet both
 acha bhi nahin
 The government's job is public welfare, it should take the path of socialism
 vyapaar kaa kaam dhanarjan he, vah poonjeevaad ko maane
 If there is a line between the two that does not allow them to meet, then these two arguments can be met without meeting
 sarkaar or uske priy udyogpatiyon ke liye bhale hi mukt ho, vyapaar mukt nahin he
 It is said that License Raj is gone
 teble ke andar jhankie, vahiin baitha milegaa
 Today's capitalism is also pretense and socialism too
 swasthya or shiksha sarkaar ke kaam the, dhire-dhire nijee haathon main ja rahe hai
 Seeing security guards everywhere, citizens seem to be responsible for their own safety
 jo karnaa tha vah karte nahin
 The government is busy in business
 rail, hawaii jahaaz, factoriyaan chalaane main
 In feeding
 aapaki pant kii jeb se paise nikaalkar aapke shart kii jeb main daal kar vot kharidne main
 Arvind's socialism is not yet tested
 unke lachchhan bhi thode vilchhan hai
 May their power and intelligence increase
 kyonki inke pehle ke sab samaajawaadee vot lene main paas hue, baaki sab main fail
 Not all were unfaithful
 itnaa zarur he ki jhuthe nikle
 Electricity, roads, water are still an issue today, thanks to them
 phir se uthaane kaa mausam bhi aa gaya he
 The public is again hopeful
 unhen bina bevafa bataae

 Mamta Banerjee said, 'I wanted to go to Chicago

 It was invited by the Ramakrishna Mission
 main jaanati hum ki kaarykram radd karne ke liye mishan ko dhamkaaya gaya, dabaav daalaa gaya
 Mamata Banerjee's reference was to the proposed program of the Vivekananda Vedanta Society on August 26 in Chicago, which was canceled by the organizers citing 'accidental difficulties'
 haalanki videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne mamata banerjee kii videsh yatra ko anumati nahin die jane sambandhi report ko ‘sach nahin’ bataate hue khaarij kiya
 Responding to media queries about the report, Ravish Kumar said on Wednesday, "we did not get any request to allow Mamata Banerjee's visit to attend the event in Chicago
" anumati dene se inkaar karne sambandhi report sahi nahin he
 The Foreign Ministry's claim was rejected by TMC national spokesperson and MP Derek o'brien, alleging that the organizers in Chicago had to cancel the event under pressure from BJP / RSS
 derek o bryan ne kaha, ‘ye saamaanya gyaan he ki bijepi-aresas chicago main ek hi mukhya kaarykram kaa aayojan hote dekhnaa chaahate the or wo bhi vaishvik hindu congress (vishwa hindu foundation) ke binar tale, jisamen mohan bhagwat ne hissaa liya
 To ensure this, huge pressure was put on the Vivekananda Vedanta Mission in Chicago to cancel the program in which Mamata Banerjee had agreed to participate
 ’is saal 11 june ko aayojakon ne mamata banerjee ko chitthee likhakar kaarykram kii apni yojana main badlaav ke bare main suchit kiya tha
 On behalf of Swami Ishtamanand, president of the Vivekananda Vedanta Society of Chicago, the letter read: "we are very grateful to you for accepting the invitation for the event to commemorate the 125th anniversary of the Parliament of World Religions
" ye kaarykram 26 agast ko chicago ke art institute main hona tha
 We regret to inform you that due to the sudden demise and unexpected troubles of Swami Abhiramananda, a member of the governing body of the Ramakrishna Mission and assistant general secretary of the Trustee of Ramakrishna Mission, we have to cancel the 26 August program
 ham aapke samarthan ke liye hameshaa kritagya rahenge or aapako hui asuvidha ke liye khed jataate hai
 On this development, BJP General Secretary Rahul Sinha has accused Mamata Banerjee of resorting to lies
 sinha ne kaha, “aayojakon ko ye ahsaas hua hoga ki mamata banerjeeswami vivekaanandapar bolne ke liye sahi vyakti nahin hai
 So there is no use calling them, so they must have canceled the program
 agar aayojak kisi kaarykram ko khud radd karte hai to uske liye centre sarkaar kaise jimmedaar ho sakati he
 "the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs was reacting to the Trinamool Congress allegation that there was a conspiracy by the central government to stop Mamata Banerjee from moving to Chicago
" haalanki pratikriya dete vakt kaarykram ko ‘vaishvik hindu congress’samajha gaya
 Whereas Mamata Banerjee received the invitation for an event organized by the Vivekananda Vedanta Society of Chicago, which was canceled
 saath hi ye kaarykram aayojan kii tithi se bahut pehle hi radd kar diya gaya tha, isliye unke (mamata banerjee) ke liye raajnneetik anumati maangane kii pehali drushti main jarurat hi nahin thi

 Rahul Gandhi raised the slogan 'chowkidar Chor Hai' throughout the election campaign

 In response to Rahul's 'chowkidar Chor Hai', Prime Minister Modi launched the 'main Bhi Chowkidar' campaign
 jise soshal media par viral kiya gaya, iske alaava jamini str par bhi utaara gaya
 During the campaign, when Rahul Gandhi was raising the Rafale issue loudly, he claimed that Narendra Modi was losing the election due to this issue
 haalanki, jab nattejey saamne aae to congress sirf 52 siton par simat gai or 2014 ke mukaable uski maatr 8 siten hi bad pain
 Significantly, Rahul Gandhi accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of stealing in the Rafale plane deal
 unka kahana tha ki pradhanmantri ne anil ambani ko 30 hajaar karod rupee kaa phayda pahunchaaya he
 However, these claims were consistently dismissed by the government as false
 ye maamla supreme court tak bhi pahunchaa, jahaan pehali baar main adaalat ne rafel vimaan saude kii prakriya ko sahi bataaya tha
 However, it was later petitioned again
 upi ke siyaasi halkon main chunaav khatm hote hi nateezon ke saath-saath sabase adhik charchaa mulaayam singh kii patni sadhana gupta ke intervyuu kii ho rahi he
 This is because for the first time he has publicly broken his silence on Akhilesh along with the quarrel of the clan
 is intervyuu kii timming ko lekar sabase adhik charchaa chal rahi he
 It is believed that if Sadhna had to target Akhilesh, she could have done it before the election and if she was not targeting him, she could have stayed for two days
 yani ki chunaav khatm hone ke baad vah aisa kar sakati thim
 Actually, this interview is being considered by political experts as part of a strategy
 unke mutabik yah sapa main akhilesh virodhiyon kaa ek daanv he
 The main reason behind this is that if Akhilesh Yadav is not able to win the election, then it will be believed that the prophecy of Sadhna Gupta will prove to be correct in which he said that there is some effect of discord in the election results
 Will happen
 isi aadhaar par chunaav baad akhilesh virdohi shaktiyaan phir se sakriy hongi or party ke bheetar akhilesh ke varchasv ko chunauti di jaaegi
 Shivpal Yadav, who was marginalized in the party, had already announced the formation of a separate party after the election results, but later he turned around
 akhilesh ke haarane kii sthiti main is tarah kii shaktiyaan phir se mukhar hongi
 Earlier on Tuesday, Mulayam Singh Yadav's wife Sadhana broke her silence before the last phase of voting in UP, saying that the party broke at the wrong time
 ANI se baatcheet main sadhana ne kaha- mere akhilesh ke bich koi baat hi nahin thi
 We have never even had an argument
 akhilesh ne kabhi mujhe jawaab tak nahin diya
 i never considered him alien
 party main jo kuch hua, vah samay ne karaayaa
 Regarding Ram Gopal Yadav, Sadhna said that Professor ji loved Netaji very much, but in the midst of it did not know what happened, maybe everything was done by time
 professor sahab kii patni jab nahin rahi thim to maine hi unke aansu ponche the
 i got their children's weddings done
 netaji bhi professor sahab se puche bina kaam nahin karte the
 On the question related to how much discord in SP will affect the elections, she said that it will definitely have an impact on elections
 lekin main chaahati hum ki hamaari party dobaaraa jite or akhilesh yadav siem bane
 i do not know who has seduced Akhilesh
 vah to meraa or netaji kaa bahut aadar karte the
 From January 1, i had such a conversation with Akhilesh, not even in five years
 tippaniyan On coming into politics, he said that Netaji never let him come, but yes he has been working from behind, but now i do not want to get into politics, i want my son Prateek to enter politics
 akhilesh yadav ke alag ho jane se jude sawaal par sadhana bhavuk ho gayi or kaha ki unke (akhilesh-dimple) kamare main jane kaa hi man nahin karata
 How to go to the room in which sons and daughters-in-law are children
 aaj bhi kamare safai hone ke baad band ho jate hai
 Never thought that Akhilesh would be separated from Netaji's life
 darasal is intervyuu ko siyaasi jaankaar ek ranneeti kaa hissaa maan rahe hai
 According to him, this is one of the stakes of Akhilesh's opponents in SP
 iske peeche mukhya kaaran yah mana ja rahaa he ki yadi akhilesh yadav chunaav jeetne main kaamyaab nahin ho pate hai to yah mana jayega ki sadhana gupta kii vah bhavishyavaanee sahi sabit hogi jisamen unhone kaha tha ki kunbe main kalah kaa kuch na kuch asar chunaav nateezon par hoga
 On this basis, anti-akhilesh powers will be active again after the elections and Akhilesh's domination within the party will be challenged
 party main haashie par pahunche shivpal yadav ne pehle hi chunaav nateezon ke baad alag party banane kii ghoshnaa kii thi lekin baad main vah palat gaye
 Such powers will again be vocal in the event of Akhilesh losing
 isse pehle upi main antim charan ke matdaan se pehle mangalvaar ko mulaayam singh yadav kii patni sadhana ne apni chuppi todate hue kaha ki galat samay party tuuti
 In a conversation with ANI, Sadhana said - There was no talk between my Akhilesh
 hamaari kabhi bahes tak nahin hui
 Akhilesh never gave me an answer
 maine kabhi use paraayaa nahin mana
 Time did what happened in the party
 ramgopal yadav ko lekar sadhana ne kaha ki professor ji netaji se bahut pyaar karte the, lekin bich main pataa nahin kya ho gaya, shaayad sab kuch samay ne karaayaa
 When Professor Sahab's wife was no more, i was the one who wiped her tears
 maine hi unke bacchon kii shaadiyaan karwaain
 Netaji also did not work without asking Professor Sahab
 sapa main kalah kaa asar chunaavon par kitna padegaa, isse jude sawaal par vah boleen ki nishchit taur par iskaa chunaavon par asar padegaa
 But i want our party to win again and Akhilesh Yadav becomes CM
 mujhe nahin pataa akhilesh ko kisne bahakaaya he
 He respected me and Netaji very much
 1 janvari se akhilesh ke saath meri itani baatcheet hui, jitani paanch saalon main bhi nahin hui
 The comments raajnneeti main aane ko lekar unhone kaha ki netaji ne kabhi aane nahin diya, par haa peeche se kaam karte rahe hai, lekin ab main raajnneeti main nahin aana chaahati, main chaahati hum ki meraa betaa pratik raajnneeti main aae
 Sadhna became emotional on the question related to the separation of Akhilesh Yadav and said that he (akhilesh-dimple) does not feel like going to the room
 kaise us kamare main jaaen jisamen betaa-bahu rahe hon, bachche rahe hon
 Even today, the rooms are closed after cleaning
 kabhi nahin sochaa tha netaji ke jite ji akhilesh alag ho jaaenge

 umr aath saal or prashansakon kii fehrist main star bodyilder samet paanch hajaar se bhi zyada log
 Brandon Blake, based in Ireland, has become an online sensation today
 star bodyilder frank medrano ne fasebuk par brandan kii tasviir share kii, jiske baad naa sirf ye photo viral hui balki balak bhi raaton-raat mashhoor ho gaya
 Medrano saw a picture of this child on Facebook
 jis andaaj main is bachche ne poj diya he, thik usee signechar style main medrano kii kai tasviren internet par maujuud hai
 This fitness freak of 25 kg is fond of gymnastics
 regular push-aps or santulit aahaar kii vajah se brandan kaa ye sharir itnaa gathila ho paaya he
 Brandon's father is a football player
 jaahir he brandan ko fitness kii ghutti ghar se hi mili he
 But gymnastics fever is due to Medrano, watching Brandon, who was convinced of his bodybuilding
 13 farvari hag de par visheshyad kiijie bachapan main jab maa ko aap pargussaata tha to aap unhen kaise manaate the
 remembered? You used to hug him perfectly
 tab aapako pataa nahin tha ki aakhir maa ke gale lagate hi unka gussa kahaan chalaa jaataa he
 But anger used to go
 darasal jab ham kisi ko gale se lagaate hai to sharir ke hormone main badlaav hone lagata he
 The inflammatory hormone testosteron starts decreasing and your anger subsides
 aisa sirf ham nahin kah rahe hai
 Recently, research done by the University of California has also revealed that a magic hug immediately melts anger
 samachar patr telegraph main prakashit khabar ke anusaar california vishvavidhyalay kii ore se karaaye gaye shodh main yah baat saamne aayi he ki aalingan or sparsh kaa sambandh kai aise swasthya gunon se he jo tanaav or pidaa ko kam karte hai
 According to research, it affects women the most
 yani mahilaayein naaraaz hon to unhen jaadu kii jhappi de kar manaaya ja saktaa he
 Psychiatric doctor Vandana Prakash said that with the embrace, the hormone responsible for increasing anger from our body starts decreasing rapidly
 kisi ko gale lagane main pyaar kaa ehsaas hota he,yani jab aap kisi ko gale se lagaate hai to uskaa sidhaa matlab hota he uske prati pyaar jataana
 Tell him that you have made a mistake so that he can forgive you
 agar aam bhashaa main kahen to sirf ek jhappi gusse ko masake kii tarah pighla sakati he
 Loving embrace has always been prevalent in our country
 magar gale milane kaa trend chalaa film ‘munna bhai embibies’ se
 When Munna Bhai used to give magic hugs to everyone in the film, people would get tears in his eyes and the goodwill shown behind hugging someone in this film made him a magic hug
 velentine wyk main ‘hag de’ sambhavat: isliye judaa taaki yadi kisi ke prati aapke man main gussa he to pyaar kaa din manaane se pehle aap use gale lagaakar apane gusse ko thanda kar len or sabhi ke saath milakar dhamal ke saath velentine de manaaen
 It is also very important because it is celebrated just one day before Valentine's Day

 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne ek baar phir daaud ibrahim ke thikaane ke bare main pakistan ko gheraa he
 Ravish Kumar said that everyone knows the fact where Dawood Ibrahim is hiding
 har saal bharat pakistan ko ek suchi saunpta he jisamen aise aparaadhiyon kaa naam hota he, jo bharat main vaanchit hai
 Ravish Kumar said that every time India asks Pakistan to hand over such elements back to India or ban them
 yah bharat lagaataar kar rahaa he
 Dawood's role in Mumbai serial bomb blast is very clear
 daaud se behichak bhartiya media baat karne main bhi safal rahi he
 Terrorists declared by the United Nations should hand Pakistan over to India
 raveesh kumaar ne kaha ki yah behad saaf he ki aantvaadiyon kaa link pakistan ke saath he
 But after looking at the list of terrorists present in Pakistan, it seems that Pakistan only tells the international community that it is taking action against terrorist organizations and terrorists but in reality it does nothing
 jab karrwai kii baat aati he to pakistan kuch nahin karata
 Pakistan is terrorists on the ground, yet Pakistan keeps saying that it is taking action against terrorists
 videsh mantralay ne kaha ki aatankiyon ke khilaaf karrwai kii jab bhi bharat maang karata he to pakistan yaa to bharat kii baat ko nazarandaaj kar detaa he, yaa asweekaar kar detaa he
 Pakistan directly denies that terrorists are hiding there
 vahiin duusari ore pakistan lagaataar khud ko aise pesh karata he ki vah aatankwaadiyon ke saath nahin he
 There are terrorists still on Pakistani soil, which are also worrying for the global community
 pakistan kii yah sthiti usek doharepan ko dikhaati he
 There are both terrorist organizations and terrorists in Pakistan
 yah pakistan ke dohare charitra ko dikhaata he
 On the other hand, Ravish Kumar said about Hafiz Saeed that when we see the steps taken by Pakistan
 aap (pakistan) karrwai karne kaa daawa karte hai, lekin jab bharat virdohi gatividhiyon main shaamil logon ke khilaaf karrwai karne kii baat aati he, to aap kuch nahin karte hai
 On the other hand you try to cheat the international community

 a post shared by Priyanka Kamboj Chopra (@design_aqua_studio) on Mar 12, 2018 at 10:17am PDTA post shared by Mankirt Aulakh (ਔਲਖਾ ਦਾ ਮੁੰਡਾ) (@mankirtaulakh) on Mar 13, 2018 at 4:02am PDT Strange views were seen outside Delhi Pradesh Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's house today
 jahaan unke ghar ke baahar amuman fariyaadiyon or dharna-pradarshan karne waalon kii bheed hoti he
 On Thursday evening, the women of Anganwadi, who had been sitting on a dharna for the past 2 months, started dancing and singing instead of protesting slogans
 darasal, ye khushi inaki tankhwaah badhane kii thi
 The Delhi government has issued a notification to increase the salary of Anganwadi workers
 isi khushi main in mahila anganwari kaaryakartaaon ne dharna khatm karne se pehle khub dance kiya or mithaiyaan bhi bantee
 Anganwadi worker Shivani says that this time too the government had announced to increase salary but they were not quite confident
 sarkaar ke notification se un sabhi ke bich khushi kii lahar he
 The government imposed a ban on the strike
 
 
 dilli sarkaar ne is bich ek faisla liya he ki mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke ghar ke baahar koi dharna-pradarshan nahin hoga
 Along with this, Sepulis has been written to the government to immediately remove the protesters sitting on the dharna
 iske saath hi emsidi ke civil lines ke dipti kamishnar ko bhi chitthee likhakar dharne par baithe logon ko hataakar rasta khaali karaane ke liye kaha gaya he
 The executive engineer of the PWD has quoted RWA letter of Flag Staff Road saying that the protests have created problems for people living in the area and school going children
 chitthee main peedblyoody kii taraf se likhaa gaya he ki pichley maheenon se lagaataar siem ke ghar ke bahradharna-pradarshan or marchaho rahe hai
 In which many protesters not only make noise and chaos
 balki, puure ilaake ko ganda bhi kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, these pickets and protests have become a problem for the people living here
 hyderabad main alag-alag ghatnaon main vaarshik pariksha ko dekhte hue mobile phone kaa adhik istemaal nahin karne or tivi dekhnaa band karne ke liye parivaar dwaara kahe jane ke baad do kishoriyon ne kathith taur par khudakushi kar lee
 The police gave this information on Sunday
 police ne bataaya ki shanivaar dopaher main 18 varshiya ek ladki ne apane ghar main faansee laga kar khudakushi kar lee
 He said that the family had allegedly told him not to use his mobile phone as the exam was close
 police ne bataaya ki anya ghatana main saatvin kaksha main pard rahi 13 varshiya ladki ne shuukravaar raat main apni awasaiya imaarat kii chhathi manzil se kud kar khudakushi kar lee
 Police said that family members told him not to watch TV and not to use mobile phones more
 unhone bataaya ki khudakushi ke maamle darj kar liye gayi hai or maamle kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 Significantly, one such case came from Bengaluru
 dasvin kaksha main padhane vaale ek chaatrane sirf isliye metro train ke aage kudakar aatmahatya kii koshish kii kyonki uski maa ne skool deree se jane ko lekar use danta tha
 Although the 18-year-old student's life was saved by the metro driver's knowledge in this incident, but he was seriously injured
 philhal uskaa ilaaj ke neshnal institute of mental health and neuro science main chal rahaa tha
 Explain that the victim's guardian used to work as Taylor
 ghatana kii jaankaree milane ke baad karnataka ke mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami ghayal se milane aspataal pahunche
 He said that it is very sad that some people take such a big step even on small talk
 gauratlab he ki is tarah kaa yah koi pehla maamla nahin he
 Earlier, a similar case was reported in Indrapuri area of delhi
 jahaan saatvin kaksha main padhane vaale ek chaatra ne khudakushi kar lee thi
 According to police, the student took this step when her mother was not present in the house
 maamle kii jaanch kar rahe police adhikari ne bataaya tha ki chaatra ne apni hatheli par suicide note bhi likhaa tha
 At the same time, a 23-year-old student preparing for civil services had allegedly attempted suicide by jumping in front of a metro train at Karol Bagh station a few months ago
 dmarsi ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya tha ki ghatana blue line par subah saadhe nau baje hui
 The youth reportedly jumped in front of the Metro going to Noida
 bataaya ja rahaa tha ki yuvak ke maathe main chot ai thi or use ram manohar lohia aspataal main nigaraanee main rakhaa gaya tha
 a police officer had said that a Mumbai-based youth used to prepare for civil services and lived with his friend in Nirman Vihar in East Delhi
 dmarsi ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya tha ki blueline par metro seva kuch samay ke liye prabhavit hui thi lekin jald hi parichaalan saamaanya ho gaya
 The earthquake may have struck Myanmar, but its horror was felt till Delhi
 pichley teen dinon main yahaan par teen halke bukampon ko mahasoos kiya gaya he
 According to the Center for Seismology, many faults pass through Delhi and surrounding areas
 in folt linon main se mukhya he dilli-muradabad folt, dilli-haridwar or sohana folt
 Fault zones are areas in which rocks are moving in different directions
 dilli sabase khatarnaak jone menin sabhi folt linon main 6 ke aasapaas ke pariman kaa bukamp paidaa karne kii kshamta he
 That is, Delhi and surrounding areas can have a magnitude of 6 on Richter scale
 lekin dilli ko sthaneey str par aane vaale kisi bukamp se utana khatra nahin he, jitna himalay main aane vaale kisi bheeshan bukamp se
 Being close to the Himalayas and being a city with a large population, the capital city of Delhi is kept in zone four in terms of earthquake
 yani sabase khatarnaak jone ke baad kaa jone
 
 
 
 tab qutubameenar ko hua tha nuksanrajdhani dilli se agar sidhe-sidhe dekhen to himalay kii duuri 200 se 250 kilometre ke bich he
 If there is an earthquake of 8 or more magnitude in the Kangra region of Himachal, then it will have a direct impact on Delhi
 uttarakhand ke gadhwal yaa kumaayun main 8 yaa 9 ke pariman kaa bukamp aata he to dilli par iskaa bheeshan asar dikhegaa
 In recent years, the Kathmandu earthquake was felt till Delhi
 aise main ye kahana galat nahin hoga ki himalay main aae kisi bahut bade bukamp se dilli main hone vaale jaan-maal ke nuksaan se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 a massive earthquake in Garhwal in 1803 is said to have damaged the upper storey of Qutub Minar
 yamuna paar ke ilaake khatarnaak jone mendilli main har tarah kaa nirmaan kaary he, avaidh nirmaan, sarkari nirmaan, nijee ghar or privet bilderon ke banaae ghar
 The biggest problem is that the government has made a building code for the buildings
 lekin iskaa koi paalan kar rahaa he yaa nahin ye monitor karne vaali koi sarkari agency nahin he
 In such a case, the building code needs to be strictly enforced
 haal hi main rajdhani dilli kaa microjonaton karaayaa gaya tha
 It was found that areas near Yamuna, near Delhi University, would suffer the most in terms of earthquake
 vajah ye he ki in ilaakon main bukamp aane kii sthiti main jameen se pani nikalne lagegaa or imaaraten usamen dhans jaaengi
 Raisina Hills safest area If you talk about Delhi Ridge and Raisina Hills, then these are the safest areas of Delhi in terms of microorganization
 lekin microjoning map ko or baariki se banaae jane kii jarurat he
 All means of dealing with the earthquake need to be mobilized as soon as possible, because a very large earthquake can occur in the Himachaya anytime

 According to the bank, it is not that these people are not in a position to fill the bank's money but they do not do it on purpose
 udhar, kisaanon kaa kahana he ki prakritik aapadaa kii vajah se fasal kharaab hone kii sthiti main wo bank kii rakam samay se nahin chukaa pate
 These farmers say that this does not mean that banks should embarrass them by putting up posters including their photos
 ye sahi he ki karj maafee raajnneetik partiyon kaa acha chunavi hathiyaar hota he
 In the election manifestos, there are breathtaking slogans like 'debt will be forgiven, electricity bill half'
 prakritik aapadaa ho to garib kisaanon ke karj maafee kii baat to samaj aati he

 Bank official Preeti said that it is not that all these people are not in a position to return the bank money
 ek-do apane majboot raajnneetik samparkon kii vajah se bainkon kii rakam nahin lautaa rahe
 When you go for recovery, you say, "when the Chief Minister can go to jail till he has been there, we will also go, what difference does it make

 They think that debt waiver will come
 priti ne kaha ki aisa nahin he ki ye log bank kii rakam waapas nahin de sakate, darasal ye aisa karne ke icchhuk hi nahin he
 When asked that when the bank gives loan, it does not investigate the taker, Preeti said that everything is seen on the bank's side
 site visit karne par sab kuch thik bhi najar aata he
 But the problem is that the sponsorship for which the loan is taken is later changed
 jaise ki maan lijie kisi ne dukaan ke liye karj liya jaataa he, to visit karne par dukaan bhi hoti he or usamen saamaan bhi hota he
 For some time, the bank is also paid properly
 lekin aage chalakardukan bandakar di jaati he or saamaan ko bhi thikaane laga diya jaataa he

 But if the influential people also take loans from the bank or sit on the horoscope then what is the way to deal with them
