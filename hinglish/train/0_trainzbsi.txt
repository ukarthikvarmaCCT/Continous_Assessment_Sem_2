 maanav sansaadhan mantralay (HRD) no ditension policy (aathvin kaksha tak student ko fail nahin karnaa) ko khatm karne vaali he
 The ministry is keen to replace it or eliminate it altogether
 khaas taur par 5veen or 8veen class main exam system ko shuru kar paas fail system ko dobaaraa lagu karwaane ke liye jor shor se kaam bhi chal rahaa he
 There are many technical hurdles behind the finish
 isamen sabase ahm he yadi is policy main kuch badlaav laana he to rhite tu ajukeshan act main sanshodhan karnaa jaruri he
 That means the bill should be introduced in Parliament, passed and notification of new law can be issued
 jis tarah se sansad main lagaataar gatirodh chal rahaa he or kai ahm bill atake pade hai aise main is bill ko paas karanava apane aap main tedhi kheer he or lanbaa samay khinch sakati he
 That is why the Ministry of Human Resources is now planning to take the opinion of the Law Ministry on this issue
 mantralay ke ek ucch adhikari ke anusaar kanoon mantralay se yah bhi poochne kii baat chal rahi he ki kya ekjicutive order ke jariye 5 veen or 8 veen kaksha main exam system yani paas fail ko jaldi se jaldi lagu kiya ja saktaa hai

 karnataka, telangna samet do or rajya isak virodh main hai or kul milakar mantralay ke paas 22 rajyon se jawaab aa chuke hai

 Everyone believes that due to this, not only are the children not paying attention in studies, their performance is decreasing but the teachers are not fulfilling their responsibilities properly
 kai rajyon kaa ye bhi suzav he ki 5veen or 8veen ke exam shuru ho lekin fail hone vaale bacchon ko thode samay baad dobaaraa exam dene kaa mauka mil sake
 Many states are demanding to start the exam from the 3rd grade
 tamaam prastaav kaa akalan keb kii ore se gathit paanch sadasyeey sab cameti kar chuki hai, puri report taiyaar kii gai he or ab yahi manthan chal rahaa he ki ise lagu kaise kiya jaae
 However, once the 5th and 8th examinations begin, then the 10th board examination will start again, because many states are demanding it too
 saal 2009 main banerite tu ajukeshan actako ek april 2010 ko deshbhar main lagu kiya gaya tha, jiske tahat 6 se 14 saal ke bacchon ko ni:shulk shiksha praapt karne kaa adhikaar he or 8veen tak use kisi bhi class main fail nahin kiya jaae

 mahilaon ke khilaaf yon shoshan ko lekar deshbhar main hue dharne-pradarshnon or kanoon ko sakht kiye jane ke baavjood rape jaisi vaaradaaten rukne kaa naam nahin le raheen
 Now the case of murder of an 18-year-old girl from the Nanded district of Maharashtra after rape
 is maamle main police kii laaparvaahee bhi saamne aa rahi he
 The family alleges that the police has refused to register an FIR, saying it was a sudden death
 vahiin parivaar waalon kaa kahana he ki unki beti kaa shav jis haalat main mila, usase saaf andeshaa he ki uske saath rape hua he
 The incident is from Kurula village in Kandahar tehsil of Nanded district
 peedita ke parivaar waalon ke mutabik, beete guuruuvaar ko unki beti do anya ladakiyon ke saath shouch ke liye gai hui thi
 Both girls returned home after defecation, but their daughter did not return
 do din tak ve apni beti ko khojate rahe, lekin jab uskaa kuch pataa nahin chalaa to police main uski gumshudagi kii shikaayat darj karwaai gai
 However, despite the complaint being lodged, the police did not bother to find their missing daughter
 harkar gharavaalon ne hi phir se apni beti kii talash shuru kii
 After searching for two days, he found his daughter's body in a well on Saturday from a nearby area
 gharavaalon ne bataaya ki unakibeti ke kapadeburi tarah fate hue the
 Then when the family requested the police to register a complaint of rape, the police also ignored him and refused to register a rape case
 police ke ravaiye se ilaake ke logon main gussa bhadak uthaa
 The family members allege that the police are in a spin to crack the case, due to which the needle of suspicion is spinning on the police itself
 iske baad qandahar tehsil ke bhoi samaaj ke logon ne thane par virodh pradarshan kiya or chetavanee di kii jab tak gunahagaaron par shikanja nahin kasata, ve peedita kilash nahin le jaaenge
 After this there was a stir in the area
 police kisi tarah peedita ke gharavaalon ko peedita ke antim sanskaar ke liye raji karne main safal rahi
 But the family of the victim is still demanding that the police file a rape case and find out the accused
 maharashtra main bhatijon ke jang kii siyasat har roj gart main girti ja rahi he
 Raj Thackeray specializes in spewing venom from the tongue, but the words Raj Thackeray used for NCP leader Ajit Pawar at a meeting in Jalna in Maharashtra is indeed shocking
 pehle jo baaten dekh lene tak simit thi wo ab ghar main ghuskar maarane tak pahunch gai he
 In the political battle, such vulgar language was rarely used
 bhatijon kii siyasat kya itani gir jaaegi? maharashtra main jameen talashne kii siyasat kya sari hadein tod dengi? bal thakare ke bhattije, raaj thakare or sharad pavaar ke bhattije ajit pavaar pichley kuch dinon se maharashtra kii siyasat main in do bhatijon kii jubaani jang se bhuuchaal aayaa haa he
 The fire of one arrow of the tongue attack does not get cold that the second arrow sets out to sieve the chest of politics
 emenes netaa raaj thakare ne phir ensipi netaa ajit pavaar ko aade haathon liya he
 Raj Thackeray, who has been visiting different areas of Maharashtra since February 10, broke all limits in the fourth assembly of Jalna district
 unki jubaan se shabd nahin balki shabdon ke rup main dhadhakate angaar phute
 NCP leader, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar even went to the extent of saying that his party people would enter the house and kill him because according to Raj Thackeray, Ajit Pawar deserves it
 maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav 2014 main he
 There is still more than 1 year in the elections, but the edge of political attacks has become so fast that it is not good for the coming days
 belgaum bolon kii vajah se emenes or ensipi kaaryakartaaon main than chuki he
 We have seen the terrible face of its consequences but this is not the end of the political battle
 ye to shuruyaat he
 Perhaps MNS leader Raj Thackeray also wants that the fire of war should continue because he has the advantage in this
 isliye raaj thakare kii jubaan gujarey dinon or gujarey vaakyon ke saath talkh hoti ja rahi he
 Now they do not even care about linguistic dignity
 ensipi netaa ajit pavaar ke bhadakaane ke baad ensipi kaaryakartaaon ne teen din pehle ahmednagar main raaj thakare kaa kafila roak liya tha
 NCP workers not only showed black flags to Raj Thackeray but also threw stones at the convoy
 emenes kaaryakarta is par mumbai or maharashtra ke duusare ilaakon main hangaamaa machaakar ensipi ko jawaab de chuke hai lekin raaj thakare kaa kalejaa thanda nahin padaa
 When Raj Thackeray reached Jalna to address the fourth meeting in about four weeks, the fire broke out
 ajit pavaar ko kosne main siyaasi hamalon kii maryaadaayen tut gayi
 The boundaries of linguistic war broke

 • 2006 or 2010 ke vipareet pehali baar bazaar main nakadi kaa pravaah yani haathon main nakadi badhane ke baad bhi jamaa nahin badi he
 • In January this year, the banks' debt-deposit ratio was at a 47-year high (78
 6 fisad) par pahunch gaya
 This height suggests that lending is much faster than deposits, which is a sign of huge risk
 • bainkon kaa karj sarkaar, mutthibhar companiyon or kuch khudara madhyavargeey graahakon ko miltaa he
 80 percent of the people who use banks do not take any loan from banks
 bainkon ke munaafe se bachat karne waalon ko kuch nahin miltaa
 Only interest is their support
 • nae karjadaar jodne ke liye bainkon ko baar-baar byaaj dar kam karnaa jaruri he taaki arthvyavastha main puunji kaa pravaah bad sake
 But as the loan gets cheaper, the interest rate on the deposit is reduced
 repo rate ko karj dar se jodne ke baad bank diposit par ritern or ghat gaya he
 • The government wants to run a cheap debt-ridden economy
 vah apane kharch ke liye jamakartaon kii bachat (bainkon se karj) par nirbhar he
 Even new capital in banks is now borrowed from them (bonds)
 • sarkaron ne bainkon main jamaa aam logon kii puunji ke sahare chhadam banking (enbiensi) kaa puraa tantra khadaa kar diya, jo ab baith gaya he
 From agriculture to industry, the outstanding loans of banks are increasing or sinking
 jamaa ghatane se bainkon kii puunji sikud rahi he, yahi vajah he ki sarkaar ne bainkon ke vilay ke jariye puunji aadhaar badhaane kii koshish kii he
 • In this environment, the bank's deposit customers have dual concerns
 unki bachat kaa ritern bhi gir rahaa he or vah karj main lutaai bhi ja rahi he isliye bank bharosa or puunji donon hi kho rahe hai
 It is difficult to get out of this cycle without changing the banking model
 • bainkon ko sansadhano ke gaiyr diposit strot badhaane honge
 Until the last century, most of the resources of banks in America came from deposits
 kramshah bainkon ne fedral rigerv se karj or bond bazaar ke jariye sansaadhan sangrah badhaayaa
 Now half the resources are non-deposits
 isse sansadhano kii laagat bhi kam hui he, jamakartaon ke liye jokhim ghate hai
 Banks in India need to be transparent, reduce government stake and activate them in the bond market so that they can borrow from the market
 • bank graahakon ko bachat par oonche ritern kii jagah suraksha yani samgr beemaa cover kii apeksha kerani hogi
 For good returns one has to go towards mutual funds and stock markets
 • karj aadhaarit nivesh kii ek seemaa tay kerani hogi kyonki ab udyogon ko apni puunji par jokhim lenaa hoga na ki jamakartaon ke paise par
 It is worth remembering that savings in the bank are the basis of the entire economy and financial system (government spending, loans to private industries, loans to nbfcs), but in spite of this the danger is not at all the deposits of common people kept in banks
 jokhim yah he ki bank ab bachat par ooncha ritern or sasta karj ek saath nahin de sakate isliye bainkon kii maujuuda afat darasal bhartiya banking ke liye astitv kaa sankat ban gai he

 After Bangladesh, the England cricket team has to tour India
 jo behad hi mushkilon se bharaa hoga
 Before this tour, England team needs to take inspiration from someone
 to wo apane duusare team ke khilaadi liyaam thomas se le sakati hai
 Because looking at the India tour, the path of England cricket team is not going to be easy in any way
 fielding karte samay liyaam thomas kaa nakli pair nikladubai main england or pakistan ke bich shaareerik aksham logon ke bich tii-20 muqabla khelaa gaya
 Where England fielder Lian Thomas was fielding at backward square leg
 tabhi ek karaara shot us disha kii taraf aayaa
 Thomas quickly ran to prevent the ball from going towards the boundary
 tabhi unka ek nakli pair nikal gaya
 But he did not care for it and picked up the ball and threw it
 iske baad unhone apni cap sahi kii phir apane artificial pair lagaaya or fielding karne chale gaye
 Thomas's effort was in vain, this tremendous fielding of Galiyas Thomas did not work for England and Pakistan managed to win this match easily
 is haar ke baad england ke captain ian nairen ne kaha ki hamane mukaable main shandaar shuruyaat kii thi
 But we lost some quick wickets in the middle overs of the game
 jiske chalate england ko haar kaa saamana karnaa karnaa padaa
 Thomas won the hearts of the sports lovers, even if the England team lost the match
 lekin liyaam thomas kaa prayaas khel premiyon ke dil ko chhu gaya
 He performed brilliantly throughout the match
 aane vaale muqablon main liyaam thomas par har kisi kii nazren hongi

 ' In the case of the help of former IPL Commissioner Lalit Modi, Rahul Gandhi has attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi

 vajah he ki dilli sarkaar ne inhen band karne kaa aadesh de diya he
 All these schools are budget schools i
e
 schools that are small, run in homes and which are not recognized
 darasal dilli sarkaar ne ek circular nikaal kar kaha he ki 31 march tak aise sabhi skool band kar die jaaenge
 In a similar budget school in East Delhi, the team of 'aaj Tak' reached more than 300 children
 dur se dekhne se aisa laga ki skool main padhai kaa str zyada acha nahin hoga lekin jab class main jaakar dekha to hairaani hui
 Children were able to talk in English just like any other private schools
 haalanki yahaan par aane vaale zyaadaatar parentsgarib tabake seate hai, jinaki masik aay 5 se 10 hajaar rupee hi he
 a parent who teaches her child in school said that the head of the household works in private job and the salary is 8000 rupees
 aise main majaburi main bachche ko ghar ke paas ke hi ek privet skool main padhaa rahe he
 Most of the parents say that the government school is nearby but the education there is not hidden from anyone, the children are getting good education and the children are also under surveillance
 vahiin skool chalaane vaale logon kaa kahana he ki ham aaj hi skool band karne ko taiyaar hai agar sarkaar in bacchon ko acchhee shiksha uplabdh karaane kii guarantee le
 Many school operators say that they run this school on the lines of No Profit Knowledge, they charge only 300 to 400 fees per child, in such a situation, the closure of the school will also lead to the job of teachers
 darasal dilli ke in bajet skulon main 10 lakh bachche padhate hai to vahiin takreeban 30 hajaar shikshak in skulon se jude hue hai
 In such a situation, the closure of school will affect the employment of so many teachers along with children
 agar ye faisla lagu kiya gaya to naa keval das lakh bacchon par bada asar padane vaala he balki hajaaron pariwaron par rojgaar kaa bhi sankat ho saktaa he
 If you are going to buy gold, then stop now because there may be a big fall in gold prices
 unnav ke dondia kheda gaanv main hone vaali khudaai main agar sachmuch kaa sona mil gaya to ek yaa do nahin balki prati 10 gram sone kii keemton main aa sakati he puure 5,000 rupee tak kii giravat
 The price of gold per ten gram is now Rs 29,500 in domestic markets, in which case the price of gold per 10 gram is reduced to about 25
 000 rupee par aa jaaegi
 Due to the availability of gold, the price of gold will also decrease in foreign markets
 jaankaron ke anusaar videshi bazaaron main sone kii keemat main prati ounce 65 dollar tak kii kami aa sakati he
 The price per ounce of gold in foreign markets is currently $ 1,315
 investment company esemasi global kii camodities fundamentals kii head vandana bharti kahati hai ki agar khudaai main sona miltaa he to gharelu bazaaron main sone kii keemat 25,000 rupee prati das gram tak pahunch sakati he, vahiin videshi bazaaron main prati ounce sone kii keemat 1,315 dollar se ghatakar 1,250 dollar tak aa sakati he
 However the Bullion Merchant Association has a different opinion on this
 association ke general secetry shrikrishna goyal chandivaala kaa kahana he ki chunki yah sona sidhe rigerv bank ke khajaane main jayega isliye sone kii keemton main koi bada fark dekhne ko nahin milegaa
 As expected, 1,000 tonnes of gold can be found in the ongoing excavation near the old temple, whose market value is currently being estimated at Rs 29 trillion
 gauratlab he ki rigerv bank ke paas abhi sirf 557 ton sona he
 Rupee will also be strong, gold will not only be cheaper by getting gold in gold, but there is a possibility that it will also strengthen the rupee against the dollar 
 jaankaron ke mutabik isse rupee main takreeban 20 fisadi tak kii majbootee aa jaaegi
 Right now, the price of a dollar is around 62 rupees, so it will be reduced to 50 rupees
 sona milane se rigerv bank ke khajaane main sone kii maatra bad jaaegi, aise main rupee kaa majboot hona tay he
 The rupee has been steadily declining against the dollar for the last five years, so if the gold is found and the rupee improves against the dollar, it will be a great relief for the Indian government

 The wait will end on May 23 when the Election Commission will count the votes and announce the result
 lekin matganana ke din bhi final nateezon ke liye or zyada pratiksha karnaa padegi
 The Election Commission has said that the results of polling in Lok Sabha seats across the country will be announced on May 23, it may take a little longer
 isaki badi vajah ye he ki iviem ke voton se vivipat kaa milan kiya janaa he, jisamen thodaa zyada vakt lagegaa
 Deputy Election Commissioner Sudeep Jain confirmed this in a conversation with Aaj Tak
 sudeep jain ne bataaya ki is baar chunavi nateezon main kuch deree ho sakati he
 According to him, these results may be delayed 4-5 hours this time
 sudeep jain ne bataaya ki iviem or vivipat ke voton kaa milan hone ke chalate ye deree ho sakati he
 Explain that VVPAT machines have also been used along with evms in the current Lok Sabha elections
 jisase vot daalane par parchi bhi nikali he
 In such a situation, when the votes are counted on May 23, the slips will also be matched to the votes cast in the evms
 iviem main gadabadi kii shikayaton ke baad chunaav ayog ne iviem ke saath vivipat lagane kaa faisla kiya tha
 Let me tell you that earlier a vvpat with an EVM was put on every seat, which was increased to 5 in every assembly after the opposition's demand
 haalanki, vipakshi dal ab bhi vivipat badhaane kii maang kar rahe hai
 Opposition parties have also appealed in the Supreme Court to put fifty percent vvpats with evms
 supreme court ne 7 may ko hi vipaksh kii is maang ko thukraayaa he, jiske baad vipakshi dalon ne chunaav ayog kaa rukh kiya he
 However, the five-phase voting has been completed
 ab do charan or baaki hai
 In such a situation, how much this demand of the opposition parties has on the Election Commission, it is a matter of discussion
 lekin ayog ne vivipat ke chalate nateezon main deree hone kii baat jarur maani he
 That is, people waiting for the election results on 23 May may have to wait a little longer

 ek daur tha jab vinod khanna ko cinema kii duniya main most handsam villen kaha jaataa tha, uske baad hero kii bhoomika main aae, to 70 ke dashak main most gudluking hero kaa khitaab mila
 In this era, he was considered as the biggest contestant of Angry Youngman like Amitabh Bachchan
 phir staradam kii chakachaundh se man achaanak uba, to sanyas dhaaran kar liya
 Then the news related to him was printed with titles like Sexy Sanyasi
 1973 main gulzaar kii film achaanak main vinod khanna ne aise nayak kii bhoomika nibhaai, jo shaadi ke baad kisi or se pyaar karne vaali apni patni kii hatya kar detaa he, lekin darshakon kii sahanubhuti apane hero se kam nahin hoti
 Gradually, with the love of the audience, that hero rises to the screen, that at the box office, movies start running on his own
 1974 main ai imtihaan naam kii film isaki misaal he
 An example of the rising popularity of Vinod Khanna during that period is also a film called Hath Ki Safai
 1974 main ai ye film amitabh bachchan ko zanjeer naam kii film se superstar banane vaale director prakaash mehara ne banaai thi
 The film was also a super hit like Zanjeer
 us kamyaabi ne vinod khanna kii chhavi bataur hero or pukhta banaai
 This image was so strong that during the era of cinema, where Amitabh Bachchan was the highest runner at the box office, Vinod Khanna was considered as the biggest contestant of Angry Youngman
 khun pasinaa main amitabh ke saamne vinod khanna kii maujuudagi baraabar kii rahi
 After that equal collision, another murid director of Amitabh, Manmohan Desai, got an eye on Vinod Khanna
 iske baad to amitabh kii har film main jaise vinod khanna kaa role pakkaa hota gaya
 Manmohan Desai reprized him with Amitabh in a film like Parvarish after Amar Akbar Anthony
 to prakaash mehara ne ek baar phir unhen 'mukaddar kaa sikandar' main aajamaaya
 Vinod Khanna, while playing the supporting hero in these four films, was seen to be on par with Amitabh
 amitabh ko baraabar kii takkar ke saath us daur main vinod khanna kii apni alag sitara haisiyat bhi thi
 With this status, two-three films of Vinod Khanna used to be superhit every year
 haalanki is daur main solo hero filmein vinod khanna ko kam hi mili
 But in the eyes of his fans, he was the only hero who could even leave behind Amitabh's superstardom
 tab kise andaja tha superstaradam kii us bulandi par us hero kaa man apane hi jehan kii ulajhanon main gum hota ja rahaa he
 His thinking about cinema had surpassed success and fame and superstadom
 1978-79 ke un barason main vinod khanna kaa man aadhyatm kii taraf jhukne laga tha
 He had said - i started feeling as if i had become a machine
 gussa, pyaar or hansi thitholi jaisi bhaawanaaon par bhi meraa koi niyantran rah gaya tha
 It was like someone presses a button and i get into action
 cinemai ection or mukhyadhara kii chakachaundh se alag mira or main tulsi tere angan kii jaisi filmein unhen zyada sukun dene lagi thim
 Like this, Vinod Khanna's mind was getting bored with the world of cinema
 ye baat kisi ko bhi hairaan karne vaali thi, jis mode se us hero ko superstaradam ke mukaam tak pahunchnaa tha, us mukaam par khyaal kuch aise aane lage the

 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki jo yuva kaam karnaa chaahate hai, use sarkaar kii ore se 10 lakh rupee kii sahaayta di jaaegi
 Government will start work on its promises soon
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that the biggest power of Bihar is manpower
 yuvaaon kaa manobal ooncha rahegaa tabhi bihar aage badhegaa
 He said that work on all seven determinations will begin before the government's term is completed for one year
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki sarkaar kii jo bhi yojanaayen he, wo saarvbhaum he
 He said that he follows the path of Gandhi, Lohia and Jayaprakash
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki bihar main kanoon kaa raaj he or kanoon kaa raaj rahegaa
 He said that Bihar is moving forward on the path of development with justice
 desh main sachhee deshbhakti or khel kii sachhee daulat tabhi apni oonchai par pahonchegi jab khilaadi rasukhadaaron or siyaasi netaaon kii ji-hujuri band kar dengehindustan kaa cricket or uske samarthak us safar ke bare main bahut kuch bataate hai jo hamane ek samaaj ke taur beete sau varshon main tay kiya he
 Ramachandra Guha and Prashant Kidambi's book on cricket tells us that cricket was played in various urban and mofussil areas of the country before partition in the last years of the 19th century
 shuruaati bhartiya club bombai, karachi, madras or kalakatta main banaae gaye the or ve apane oobdkhabad maidaanon par aapas main khelaa karte the
 At the same time, Saheb people used to play in their lush green fields
 desh ke vibhinn rajnatik samoohon ne jis vakt samrajya kii nirvivaad satta ko lalkaarna shuru kiya, unheen dinon hindustan kii timen kabhi-kabhaar goron ke khilaaf bhi khilne lageen
 In the beginning, Indian teams were generally defeated, but gradually it was no longer easy to tell about the results
 in maichon main sthaneey janata kii cheekhti-chillaati bheed hoti jo apni desi tiimon kaa samarthan karti
 The victory could have meant a rowdy celebration
 jaahir he, yah khel bhaawanaaon ko hawa detaa tha
 The idea of the national team also came up around the independence movement
 fark yah tha ki shahari or gramin hindustan ke garibon ke saath judye kii khatir gandhi or congress apane madhyamvargeey gheron se baahar aa gaye, par hindustan kaa sangathit cricket aguai ke liye maharaajaaon or nawabon kii ore takata rahaa
 Not surprisingly, the issues of politics of the country continued to come into play
 kya hindu, musalmaan, sikh, parsi or isai ek hi team main khel sakate the? oonchi jati or tabakon ke boj se dabi team tab kya karti jab dalit honhaar khilaadi khud ko team se baahar rakhana namumican bana detaa? team ek saath safar karti? kya ve saath baithkar khaanaa khate? kya ve keval khel ke maidan par hi saath aate?duusare vishwa yuddh ke khatm hote-hote, upmahadweep main vaaki honhaar khiladinnon kii acchhee-khaasi sankhya thi
 The 11 players chosen correctly could challenge any team in the world
 ek mashhoor khilaadi kii partner ne ek baar kaha ki angrejon ne hindustan kaa bantwaaraa mukhya rup se is vajah se kiya kyonki ''sanyukt bharat kii team vishwa cricket main tamaam bade muqablon kaa khaatmaa kar detii
 "cricket was also destroyed by the Partition, especially in the north and west of the subcontinent
" log ab bhi kehete hai ki honhaar ballebaaj badi taadaad main hindustan main rah gaye jabaki takreeban puraa kaa puraa pas atake pashchimi pakistan main chalaa gaya
 Even if it was a simplification, the reality was that the partition divided things between India and Pakistan in a non-equal way
 jis tarah deshbhakti kii dharanaon ko phir se phentna padaa, usee tarah hindustani team kaa samarthak hone kaa matlab 1947 ke baad main vahi nahin rah gaya jo pehle hua karata tha
 In the first 20 years after independence, we have had to face many insults and honorable draws
 cricket ke ye mureed 1950 or 1960 ke dashak main bade hue the, or to bhi hamaare bheetar ke deshbhakt cricket premi ne kabhi haar nahin maani
 Indian cricket made two high leaps, one in the early 1970s and the other at the end of that decade
 1970-71 main pehle west indies main or phir england main siries jeetne se hindustani mureedon kii ummid paravaan chadhgaye lagi
 The year 1983 was very different — we won in this format too, the same format that was yet to challenge our slow-scoring batsmen, Test-ready bowlers and sluggish fielders
 vishwa cap main ham har desh se behatar sabit hue
 Our superiority blossomed and waned in the years immediately following that World Cup victory, but this screaming, blue shirt tearing spirit of victory euphoria would not deteriorate for the next 30 years
 haal main chijen badal gai hai
 The Hindustani team became domineering with the hidden Rustom, but the euphoria of this victory has turned into something ugly
 yah tabdili 2001 or 2011 ke bich apane aakhir daur main pahunchi or iskaa vaasta duusari chizon ke alaava hamaare behatar khel, hindustani tivi darshakon main jabardast badhotaree or ipiel ke vishaal khel udyog main badalane se he
 Along with this economic strength, players began to show more aggression in the field
 2001 ke aasapaas (yaa uske kuch baad) hamaare khilaadi us beemaari kii chapet main aane lage jise 'osiitis' yaa 'ojiitis' kaha ja saktaa he—bad-chadhakar sledging or aakraamak shaareerik isharebaaji, jise steve wa ke netritv main australiaayyon ne kala kii oonchai par pahunchaa diya tha
 During the 2001 Test series, Ganguly made Waugh wait for a toss to the extent of being irritated, with Dravid calling the three Australians a 'fuckoff'
 johnisburg main 2003 ke vishwa cap final main jahir khan ne mathew heden ko slage karne kii koshish kii
 Slinging became as important as the skills of batting, bowling and fielding, until the Indian boys' next batch wore the national team's dress
 inamen se ek yuva turk (ab team main post padate bade khilaadi) se achaanak meri mulaakaat hui or maine kaha ki ve kuch zyada hi aakraamak ho rahe hai, tab unhone dur se gurraate hue kaha, 'no, no, natthing! viyyavatu givvidbag tudam! 'hamen australiaayyon kii beemaari lagi thi, par isamen hamane apni anth bhi jod lee
 Australians can be racist, masculine and overbearing, they can also be deceitful, but they do not exhibit superstition or militarism
 maidan main unki dress par agar koi cheez judi hoti he, to vah stan cancer ke khilaaf jang sareekhe makasad kaa samarthan karne ke liye hoti he; ve rashtrawaad yaa siyaasi manyataayen dur rakhte hai
 On the other hand we are moving from unrestrained to senselessness
 hamaari team 'apane sainikon ke prati himaayat dikhaane' ke liye antarrashtriya match main military cap pahanakar aa jaati he, mahendra singh dhoni vishwa cap main wicketcaping glavj par apni regiment kaa chinh pahanakar aate hai; england kii neeli dress se alag dikhne kii daleel par ham apane kapadon main ek khaas rang jod lete hai, jo sattashin party kaa pasandida rang hota he
 Players are known to be politically foolish and generally tend to lean towards overbearing politicians (see pictures of Erdoोगan at Mesut Ozil's wedding ceremony), but there are exceptions
 america footbal ke bade khiladinnon ko dekhen jo raashtragit ke liye khadey hone se manaa kar dete hai or america raashtrapati donald trump kii nitiyon ke khilaaf khadey hote hai, yaa megan repino ko dekhen, jinhone vishwa cap jeetne ke baad trump ko apni bich kii ungali dikhaai
 We are far from the multi-faceted success of Australia in the Indian Games, but we are the ravenous newcomers to the cricketing world
 semifinal main newjiland ke haathon magarur hindustani team ko dharashayi hote dekhne main thodaa ajeeb-sa santosh tha
 As far as opposition is concerned, freedom and true patriotism (and yes, the true wealth of the game) will be manifested when any internationally successful Indian woman or male player stands fearlessly against the government of the country on a political issue

 The government will investigate it
 ’’ seemaa shulk vibhaag ke samaaroh ke maukey par ve supreme court dwaara 2-ji maamle main aae aadesh par puche gaye sawaal kaa jawaab de rahe the
 Mukherjee said, "the decision has come and we will investigate this decision and its impact
" sarkaar isaki chaan-been karegi
 On the occasion of the function of the Customs Department, he was answering the question asked by the Supreme Court on the order in the 2G case
 avaidh khanan par apni report sarkaar ko saunpane ja rahe karnataka ke lokayukta nyaayamurti santosh hegade ko is baat kaa vishwaas nahin he ki sarkaar is report par koi karrwai karegi
 LIVE Aaj Tak see Justice Hegde, a former Supreme Court judge, said, 'as i said earlier, i am not sure that the government will take any action
 ’doorsanchaar mudde par pehle pradhanmantri, grih mantri istipha den: yediurppounhone kaha, ‘unhone (pradesh sarkaar) pehali (antarim) report rakhi (disambar 2008 main jamaa kii gai), par us par koi karrwai nahin kii
 Lokayukta registrar Moses Kunhi Nair Mulle is about to submit the report to Chief Secretary SV Ranganath
 report ke mutabik, march 2009 se april 2010 ke bich avaidh khanan ke kaaran pradesh ke rajkosh ko 1,800 karod rupee se bhi zyada kaa nuksaan pahunchaa he
 In the Lokayukta report, Yeddyurappa, recommending an inquiry against four ministers, Hegde, a member of the Lokpal Bill drafting committee, refused to divulge more details about the report
 is report main mukhyamantri bi es yediurppa, chaar cabinet mantriyon, purv mukhyamantri or jad (es) netaa ech di kumaraswami ke alaava lagbhag 500 anya adhikariyon ko bhi doshi tehraaya gaya he
 Asked whether you would submit your report to the Supreme Court as well, Justice Hegde said that the apex court has not sought a report from him
 unhone kaha, ‘agar kaha gaya, to mujhe report deni hogi or main unhen report saunp duungaa
 Otherwise, anyone else can give it
 ’yediurppa par faisla lokayukta kii report milane ke baad: garkaripichley saptaah nyaayamurti hegade ne kaha tha, ‘meri ekmaatr aashaa ucchtam nyaayalay he
 He said that the leak of the report does not mean that it has lost its 'importance'
 unhone kaha, ‘iskaa matlab sirf yah he ki kisi ko yah pehle se hi mil gai he
 It is not like leaking of any examination paper
 ’ nyaayamurti hegade ne kaha ki unhone report main jaanch main shaamil lokayukta ke paanch adhikariyon ko ‘sambhavit khatre’ ke bare main bhi kaha he
 Demanding to remove Yeddyurappa from within the BJP, he said, 'I have not said that they are already in danger
 ’ lokayukta ne kaha ki in adhikariyon ne sambhavat: kuch logon ko (unke avaidh maamalon kii jaanch karke) naaraaz kar diya he or unka bhavishya khatre main padane kii ashanka he
 'sufficient' evidence against Yeddyurappa: Hegde When asked if he had some 'bitter' experiences while leaving the Lokayukta post, Justice Hegde said, "when it comes to leakage, i feel bitter
 vaise nahin
 He said that this report contains detailed information about iron ore exports, the people involved, illegal work and its price
 louh ayask niryaat ko pratibandhit karne par jor dete hue hegade ne kaha ki inke niryaat se desh ko koi phayda nahin hone vaala

 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Subramanian Swamy said that according to Article 9 of the Constitution, Rahul Gandhi cannot be an Indian citizen
 british naagarik hone kii meri shikaayat par congress ne jawaab dene ke liye grih mantralay se 15 din kaa samay maanga tha
 The deadline of 15 days has now expired, but the reply has not come yet
 subramanya swami ne rahul gandhi kii naagarikta par sawaal uthaate hue grih mantralay se shikaayat kii thi
 After this, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued a notice to Rahul Gandhi seeking an answer in this regard

 RG had asked for another 15 days to reply to the Home Ministry notice on my charge that he was a British national and hence cannot be Indian citizen vide Article 9 of Constitution
 Even that 15 days period is over
 No reply !! - Subramanian Swamy (@ Swamy39) June 9, 2019 Justice HL Dattu and Justice Amitav Roy dismissed the petition saying that PIL cannot be person centered
 adaalat ne yah yachika daayar karne vaale adhivaktaa emel sharma ko fatkaar bhi lagaai
 Questioning the intention of the petitioner, Justice HL Dattu said, "how can a demand for inquiry against a particular person be the subject of a PIL?" Why didn't you complain to the Election Commission? You could have knocked the door of the lower court too
 subramanyam swami ne aarope lagaaya tha ki rahul gandhi ke paas british naagarikta bhi he
 In support of his claim, he had also released some documents

 The police have finally settled the case of sensational murder which caused tension in the Jharkhand capital Ranchi for the last two days
 police ke mutabik, yah honor kiling kaa maamla hai
 a school teacher, her husband and two children have been arrested in the case
 ranchi police kaa daawa he ki shikshak or unke pati ne maamle main apni sanliptata sweekaar kar lee he

 Despite this, the school administration maintained that the child died of the disease
 yah maamla dekhte hi dekhte tool pakad gaya or vibhinn sanghathanon or abhibhavakon kii ore se skool ke baahar pradarshan kiya ja rahaa tha
 The comments maamle kii saghan jaanch ke baad ranchi ke varisht police adheekshak kuldeep dvivedi ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan main puure maamle kaa khulaasa kiya
 He said that some people of the school had informed that the deceased student Vinay was seen at the house of a female teacher and was also assaulted
 is teacher kii beti bhi vinay ke saath padhati thi
 It was also told that in the past too, the teacher's son had also assaulted Vinay due to a love affair
 shikshak kaa betaa bhi isi skool main 11veen kaa chaatr he
 According to the police, the family had called and threatened Vinay in the matter

 udhar upi ke shikshak pareshaan hai ki jinhone pariksha nahin di wo kaise compatishan main paas kar gaye
 On the other hand, Justice Chandchud has also said the same thing as Justice Indu Malhotra in investigating the essential aspect of which religion
 is tarah se aap dekhen to koi pratha kisi dharm kaa anivaary hissaa he yaa nahin ise lekar teen jajon kii raay ek jaisi he
 In prime time on Ismail Farooqui's decision, constitution expert Faizan Mustafa had said that the Supreme Court should not decide any issue on the basis of religious imperatives
 faizan mustafaa yah kahana chaahate he ki islam kaa kya hissaa he yah tay karne ke bajaae adaalat sidhaa kah sakati thi ki sarkaar ko kisi mandir or masjid ke adhigrahan kaa paryaapt kanoonee adhikaar he
 We asked Faizan Mustafa whether it was okay for me to think about disagreements in different matters
 ab supreme court ke ek duusare bade faisle par aate hai
 a bench of Justices Deepak Mishra, Justice AM Kharmilkar and Justice Chanchur ruled out a SIT to investigate the arrest activists and lawyers in the Bhima Koregaon case, giving a verdict of two each
 justise khanvilakar ne apane faisle main kaha ki chaar hafte or ye ectvist nazarband rahenge
 The court also warned the police to avoid fabricating fabricated and fake evidence against the accused activists
 agar saboot managasaint paae gaye to adaalat in chhapemariyon kii jaanch ke liye es ai tii bana degi
 So in a way, the court did not listen to SIT but also said that if Fazchwada is there, they will also make SIT
 justise chandchur kii asahmati ne kaha ki asahmati ke naam par vipaksh kii awaz ko nahin kuchlaa ja saktaa he
 If freedom is crushed now, it cannot be repaid later
 maharashtra police ke bartaav se nishpaksh jaanch ko lekar sawaal uthte hai
 The Maharashtra Police stated its stand that those arrested were related to the banned terrorist organization and were part of a larger conspiracy
 supreme court ne yah sunate hue kaha ki kisi kii azaadi anumaanon ke aadhaar par nahin kuchli ja sakati he
 We will keep an eye on this matter
 aap jaanate hai ki giraftaar activist sudhaa bharadwar, varvara raav, gautam navalkha, arun farera, vernon gozalvis kii taraf se professor romila thapar,devaki jain, prabhaat patnayak satish deshpandey or majaa daaruwala ne yachika daayar kii thi
 He prominently highlighted Justice Chandchud's remarks during a press conference in which he has said that he does not agree with the government side that the third party does not interfere in the case of the petitioners
 jab sanvaidhanik adhikaron ko hanan ho rahaa ho, swatantraaa par aghat pahunchaaya ja rahaa ho to insaaf ke raste main technical baaten roda nahin ban sakati hai
 The petitioners made their stand in the Press Club after the court's decision
 iske alaava justise chandchur kii tippanee kii kaaphi charchaa he
 Justice Chandchud has said that the only way to balance between the two lies is that the investigation should be done in a fair and independent manner
 lekin main siddhant rup se apane do saathi jajon se sahamat nahin hum
 The comments justise di vaai chandchur ne es ai tii se jaanch karaane ke paksh main kai udhaaharan die magar faisle main ise sweekaar nahin kiya gaya
 Justice Chandchud has made serious remarks on the role of Maharashtra Police and said that on 29 August 2018, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Maharashtra government and others
 faisle ke chand ghante ke bheetar pune main joint kamishnar shivarirao bhodke ne press conference kar di jisamen daawa kiya ki pune police ke paas paryaapt saboot hai
 While the court stayed the transit of these five people
 ghar main nazarband kiya tha
 This police behavior was inappropriate
 aisa laga ki police court ke notice kaa jawaab electranik media ke zarie de rahi he
 On August 31, 2018, ADG Law and Order Shri Paramveer Singh ADG also held a press conference and showed many letters which were not even forensic examined
 
 On June 8, a letter from Sudha was issued to the media before the court proceedings commenced
 aarope tha ki giraftaar log pradhanmantri par hamalaa karnaa chaahate hai
 This letter was shown on TV
 jabaki in patron ko court ke saamne nahin rakhaa gaya
 Nor did transit demand form part of the application
 yah kaaphi gambhir maamla he
 This casts doubt on the fairness of the investigation
 police jaj nahin he
 Politics is interpreting differently and law experts are interpreting differently
 in badi badi baton ke bich bihar ke 80,000 chaatr pareshaan hai ki 1 aktubar ke pehle admit card nahin aayaa to unke jivan kaa ek saal barbaad ho jayega
 On the other hand, the teachers of UP are upset that those who did not take the exam passed in competition
 adaalat ne police ko chetavanee bhi di ki aaropee activiston ke khilaaf managasaint or nakli saboot jamaa karase bache
 If evidence is found concocted, the court will make SIT to investigate these raids

 Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar has said that the chain of tension on the indo-pakistan border will stop
 agenda ajtak main 'hai taiyaar ham' seshan main hissaa lete hue parrikar ne sena kii taiyaariyon par baat kii
 On the question whether the country is going towards war or towards peace, the Defense Minister said that peace is the best thing
 lekin agar aapako shanti kaa nirmaan karnaa he to takat badhaani hogi or takat dikhaani hogi
 We have a history of walking in the path of peace
 lekin jo yuddh ke dar se samjhauta kar lete hai jo darpok kehalaate hai
 On the policy of not attacking first, Parrikar said that India does not take aggressive attitude
 halaat ke mutabik koi faisla karnaa chahie
 If there is a situation like war, there will be some loss
 shahadat acchhee nahin hoti
 We also do not like to have a war
 tension badhata he to ham bhi apane jawan khote hai
 But as the Minister of Defense we have a responsibility to protect our citizens
 sargical strike ke sawaal par parrikar ne kaha ki border cross karnaa sena kaa kaam he, sarkaar nahin karti
 But political leadership has to decide in this regard
 unhone kaha, 'sargical strike agar kaamyaab rahaa to sabhi jalane lage
 He felt that the government would take credit for it
 agar naakaam hote to javabdehi bhi hamaare upar hi aati
 We would be criticized
 agar faisla lene kii jimmedaari modi sarkaar kii he to kamyaabi kaa credit bhi milanaa chahie
 We gave free hand to the army
 pehle aisa nahin hua tha
 Parrikar said that the Modi government is not doing politics about the army, but the Chief Minister of Bengal
 unhone kaha, 'maine sansad main kaha tha ki sena ko raajnneeti main nahin ghasita jaae
 He further said, "I have been associated with RSS, am a BJP man, IIT student
 in sabhi becoground kii vajah se main koi faisla lene main sakasham hum
 This has nothing to do with the decision on surgical strikes
 main goa main bhaashan karata hum to centre sarkaar yaa sargical strike kaa zikr nahin karata
 Pakistan does not even take its name
 meraa sens of humar thikthak he
 But this sometimes causes controversy
 'raksha kharid ke maamle par parrikar ne kaha ki ye 12 saal se jaise chalate aa rahe the, vaise hi chalate aa rahe hai
 Now we are improving this process

 ) The Shiv Sena and BJP alliance has once again come under a rift
 is baar vajah he maharashtra ke ratnagiri main lagane vaala west coast oil rifynary project
 Even though the leaders of both the parties are accusing each other in this matter, but its political meaning is something else
 aaie jaanate hai is puure vivaad ke peeche kii raajnneeti ko
 
 
 Shiv Sena is protesting against the country's largest West Coast oil refinery project
 is bare menshivsena supremeo uddhav thakreka kahana he ki ham rifynary project ko konkan main nahin lagane denge, kyonki isse paryaavaran ko nuksaan hoga
 Not only this, the project is against the people of Nannar village
 yadi yah project lagata he to isse gaanv ke logon kii jameen ko bahari log kharid lenge
 Thackeray has clearly warned Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis about this project that it is against this project and if it wants to be imposed by the government, then it should be planted in Vidarbha or Gujarat
 kaisaa he project
 
 
 Now, if we talk about the project, the proposed capacity of this refinery will be 60 million tons per year
 yani ki vartmaan main jamnagar sthit bharat kii sabase badi rifynary se 70 pratishat zyada
 The Jamnagar refinery currently has a capacity of 35 million tonnes
 project kii laagat teen lakh karod rupee
 
 
 The cost of this project is three lakh crores
 yadi yah project puraa hota he to isse ek lakh logon ko rojgaar milegaa
 The refinery will currently be promoted by three public sectors
 ye hai hindustan petroleum (HPCL), bharat petroleum( BPCL) or indian oil (IOC)
 The biggest partner among these three is Indian Oil
 isaki project main 50 % hissedari he
 At the same time, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum share 25%
 april 11, 2018 ko teenon piesu or saudi aramko ke bich rifynary or petrochemicals complex banane ke liye emoyu sin hua tha
 Subsequently, in 2015, the central government chose Maharashtra to implement the project
 shivasena ke aaropon par kya kahana he bijepi kaa?bijepi kaa kahana he ki is project se paryaavaran ko nuksaan hone kii baat puri tarah galat he
 It is a green project and will use advanced technology, which will not harm the environment
 bijepi ne yah sawaal bhi uthaaya ki jab maharashtra main newclear project lage the tab to kabhi shivasena ne virodh nahin kiya
 Then why are you putting a hurdle on this project now
 haalanki, is product ko paas karne ke liye bijepi netaa kai morchon par shivasena ko manaane kii koshish kar chuke hai, lekin shivasena ab bhi maani nahin he
 So what is the politics behind this? BJP President Amit Shah had talked about contesting again with Shiv Sena in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, but Shiv Sena leaders kept away from this issue
 haalanki, donon partiyon ke bich kai baar vivaad hua, lekin ab tak donon gathbandhan main he
 But politics is different about Konkan
 darasal, shivasena konkan main acchhee pakad rakhti he
 Whereas the BJP has been trying to spread its footing for a long time
 jo shivasena ko katai raas nahin aa rahaa he
 So the BJP wanted to get out among the people through the refinery project, but Shiv Sena protested
 ab aane vaale vakt main dekhnaa yah hoga ki is mudde ko lekar shivasena or bijepi kahaan tak jate hai
 At the same time, there is also a new challenge in front of Shiv Sena, Narayan Rane, who has recently set foot in Konkan with his new party Maharashtra Swabhiman Party
 kya he konkan kii sthiti?konkan main teen jile aate hanratnagiri, sindhdurg or raigarh
 There are two Lok Sabha and 12 Assembly seats here
 2014 ke loksabhaa main shivasena ne yahaan se donon siten jiti thim
 While in the assembly elections, 6 seats were won by Shiv Sena, three NCP, one Congress and 2 seats for PWP

 He attacked the RJD and Congress, saying that if he disagreed with the move of the head of the government, he has no fundamental right to stay in the coalition
 paswan ne kaha, 'notebandi ke mudde par jediu ke faisle se argedy or congress ko koi pareshaani ho rahi he to unhen sarkaar se baahar aa janaa chahie or gathbandhan ko tod dena chahie
 RJD and Congress opposing demonetisation's 'eat jaggery and avoid dumpling' policy is not going to work

 The silence in the Kedarnath temple came to an end this morning after the devastation caused by the horrific natural disaster in Uttarakhand in June, 86 days after the floods that plunged more than 400 people to death in the Kedar Valley Prayers and worship took place in this Himalayan shrine
 kedarnath mandir bhale hi shraddhaluon ke liye shuru nahin hua he par ek acchhee khabar yah he ki paanchvaan dham kahe jane vaale or sikhon sabase bade tirthasthalon main se ek hemkund sahib gurudwara shraddhaluon ke liye khol diya gaya he
 The route from Govindghat to Hemkund Sahib has been repaired

 Worship and prayer were started today on the occasion of "sarvartha Siddhi Yoga", which is considered extremely auspicious
 uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri vijay bahuguna apane kuch mantrimandaleey sahyogiyon ke saath aaj kii puja main shaamil hone vaale the, lekin kharaab mausam kii vajah se vah dehradun se nahin aa sake
 Kedarghati is covered with a thick fog sheet
 aaj subah savere hui puja ko cover karne ke liye aane vaale media ke vibhinn dalon ko yahaan se kareeb 22 kimi dur guptkashi main ruknaa padaa, kyonki vah kharaab mausam kii vajah se aage nahin bad paae
 The temple was preceded by 'purification' and then 'atonement' (atonement for not worshiping in the temple for a long time)
 pradhan pujari ke saath badi sankhya main purohit or badrinaath kedarnath samiti ke adhikari maujuud the
 The whole temple resonated with the chanting of chants and the sound of the sacred conch shell

 The Kedarnath temple may not have started for devotees but a good news is that Hemkund Sahib Gurudwara, one of the biggest pilgrimage sites known as the Fifth Dham and one of the largest Sikhs, has been opened for devotees
 govindghat se hemkund sahib tak jane vaala rasta durust kar liya gaya he
 Shortly after the fire broke out as the needles of the clock indicated seven o'clock, Rawal Bhim Shankar Linga Shivacharya, the head priest of this sixth-century temple, opened the doors of the temple and entered the sanctum sanctorum to worship
 puja or prarthana aaj ‘‘sarvaarth siddhi yoga’’ ke avasar par shuru kii gai, jise atyant shubh mana jaataa he
 Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna was scheduled to attend today's puja along with some of his ministerial colleagues, but could not come from Dehradun due to bad weather
 kedarghati ghaney kohre kii chadar se dhaki he
 This morning various groups of media who came to cover the morning worship had to stay at Guptkashi, about 22 km from here, as they could not proceed due to bad weather
 puja se pehle mandir kaa ‘shuddhikaran’ or phir ‘praayshchitkaran’ (mandir main lambey samay tak puja na karne ke liye praayshchit) kiya gaya
 a large number of priests and officials of Badrinath Kedarnath Committee were present along with the head priest
 samuhik mantrocchar or pavitra shankh kii dhwani se puraa mandir gunj uthaa

 uttar pradesh kii ummid priyanka gandhi hai
 Rahul's trump card, sister Priyanka! Significantly, Priyanka Gandhi's decision to enter politics was not unexpected, but Rahul Gandhi did not let anyone know about it
 wo aaraam se amethi pahunche the, ashok gahalot rajasthan kaa raaj chalaa rahe the
 And a letter is issued from Delhi that the party Priyanka Gandhi has been appointed in-charge for the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh
 madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri banate-banate rah gaye jyotiraditya sindhiya pashchimi uttar pradesh main congress kaa bedaa paar lagaayenge
 Rahul has fielded Priyanka Gandhi as a trump card just three months before the biggest election of 2019

 His art of instantly connecting people with himself can do wonders

 21 saal kii naga jhaansi hyderabad ke srinagar colony main rahati thim
 The body of the actress is found hanging from the fan in her house
 pinkavila kii report ke mutabik actress ne jab suicide kiya, us vakt wo ghar main akeli hi thi
 According to the police, when his brother Durga Prasad knocked on the door, there was no sound from inside
 iske baad unhone padosiyon ko is baat kii jaankaree di
 When the family broke inside and broke the door, the body of the actress was found hanging from the fan
 reports ke mutabik atopsi ke liye actress ke shav ko hyderabad sthit gandhi hospital le jaaya gaya or panjagtta police stesan main cese darj karaayaa gaya
 The real reason for the suicide has not been revealed
 lekin sutron ke hawaale se kuch reports main kaha gaya he ki naga jhaansi kai maheenon se depressant main thim
 The reason for this is being told to reject the wedding proposal of the actress's partner
 ibetimes kii report ke mutabik actress ne surya ke saath shaadi karnaa chaahati thim
 But this relationship was not accepted by the parents
 parents ne is shaadi se inkaar kar diya tha

 dhanteras par dhanvantari dev kii puja hoti he
 He is also called the Acharya of Ayurveda
 ye devataaon ke vaidya hai
 Dev Dhanvantari is also considered to be the brother of Lakshmi
 inhen ke avatarit hone se judi he dhanteras ke din bartan kharidne kii parampara
 When the sea was churning, fourteen gems came out of the deep depths of the ocean
 dhanvantari inhen ratnon me se ek hai
 When the god and the demon were churning the sea with the help of Vasuki Nag making the Mandar mountain churning, Dhanavantri appeared as the 14th jewel on the Trayodashi of Kartik Krishna Paksha after 13 gems
 wo amrit kalash ke saath prakat hue the
 As soon as Dhanvantari appeared, a quarrel between the gods and the demons began
 amrit kalash ke liye devataaon or daanvon ke bich chhina-jhapati shuru ho gai
 But Lord Vishnu took the form of Mohini and acquired the Amrit Kalash
 kyon hoti he dhanvantari kii puja?dhanvantari amrit yani jivan kaa vardaan lekar prakat hue the
 He was also a knowledgeable person of Ayurveda, so he is considered to be the god of healing
 vaise to dhan or daulat kii devi lakshmi detii hai, lekin unki krupa paane ke liye sehat or lambii aayu kii jarurat hoti he
 This is the reason why Dhanvantari is worshiped on the occasion of Dhanteras
 dhanteras par kyon kharidte hai bartan?karthik krishna paksh kii trayodashi ko bhagwaan dhanvantari kalash lekar prakat hue the isliye is tithi ko bartan kharidne kii parampara he
 It is believed that the number of purchases you make on the day of Dhanteras increases by 13 times
 kyon kharidte hai dhanteras par chaandi?darasal chaandi ko chandramaa kaa pratik mana jaataa he jo sheetaltaa pradaan karata he
 It is also believed to be a healthy person who gives a healthy body and a sharp mind
 chandramaa ke prabhaav se man main santosh ke dhan kaa vaas hota he or ise sabase bada dhan kaha gaya he
 The one who has satisfaction and health, he is considered the richest
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne party kii sansadeey dal kii baithak main kaha ki congress ko bhaajapa sarkaar kii vibhaajankaree or adhikaaravaadi raajnneeti kaa muqabla karnaa chahie
 Sonia accused the Modi government of copying the upa's schemes and following the policy of minimum governance
 unhone kaha ki satta main aane ke baad se bhaajapa unheen nitiyon ko lagu kar rahi he, jinhen upie sarkaar dwaara laayaa gaya tha
 Sonia said, she is welcome to steal our thoughts
 
 
 nakal karnaa juthi tarif kaa sabase badhiya tarika hota he
 The Congress chief said, it is time for us
 loksabhaa main hamaari sankhya ab tak kii sabase kam he
 The process of re-building and restoring people's trust in the Congress has begun
 sonia gandhi ne kaha ki congress apane ko phir se khadaa karne ke liye puri shakti se ladegi
 He attacked the government over incidents of communal violence and reiterated the statement made by Rahul Gandhi in the past that the incidents of communal violence in UP were done deliberately for political gain
 sonia ne kaha ki bhaajapa ke satta main aane ke baad se sampradayik hinsa kii ghatnaon main chintajanak rup se vruddhi hui he
 Hundreds of incidents of communal violence and riots have been reported in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Maharashtra and many other states
 iske atirikt anya staron par ashishnutaa ke ghaatak sanket mil rahe hai
 He said, i do not want to go into detail
 aap sabhi bhaajapa ke kuch janpratinidhiyon ke bhadde vyavhaar se parichit hai
 Apart from this, the unacceptable views of some others are completely disrespectful to the secular traditions and constitutional sanctity that have stood the test of time
 narendra modi sarkaar antakawaad or aatankiyon par sakht he
 In Jammu and Kashmir, 800 terrorists were killed in the last five years
 sarkaar kii jiro tolerance policy par amal karte hue suraksha balon ne yah karrwai kii
 According to the data released by the government in the Lok Sabha on July 2, the death toll of terrorists is increasing every year
 sarkaar ne bataaya he ki suraksha balon kii ore se ghuspaith ke prayaason ko naakaam karne or desh ke aantarik bhaagon main aatankwaad rodhi gatividhiyon tathaa javaabi karrwai ke jariye aatankwaad kaa muqabla kiya jaataa he
 Lok Sabha MP Nitesh Ganga Deb had asked the government that the number of terrorists killed in Jammu and Kashmir at present has increased compared to previous years, if so, how many terrorists were killed during the last five years
 is sawaal kaa loksabhaa main jawaab dete hue raksha rajya mantri shripad nik ne bataaya ki suraksha balon kii lagaataar karravaayiyon se aatankwaadiyon kaa safaya hua he
