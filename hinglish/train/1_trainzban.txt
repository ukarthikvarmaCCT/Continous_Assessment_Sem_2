 For the first time for the convenience of passengers on the Noida City center-vaishali route from Dwarka Sector 21, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has started running an eight-compartment metro train
 metro kii noida line par sabase zyada log safar karte hai or bheed kii vajah se safar main logon ko mushkilon kaa bhi saamana karnaa padataa he
 Heavy congestion and fewer coaches in the train have started harassing the passengers, that's why DMRC decided to run the eight-coach train, but the wait for the Noida line metro with eight coaches has now ended
 is khabar se musafiron ko bhi bheed se nijaat milane kii ummid bandhi he
 The number of passengers traveling in the Delhi Metro has also crossed 25 lakh
 isamen sabase zyada 9 lakh se bhi zyada musafir blue line yani dwarka noida line se safar karte hai
 Currently, an eight-coach metro has been run on this line, by the end of 2014 their number will be 31
 gudgaanv jahangir puri line par pehle se hi aath coach kii metro chalaai ja rahi he or yahaan sabhi chaar coach vaali metro ko chah coach main badal diya gaya he
 However, the Blue Line still has to run a four-coach metro, as DMRC is short of coaches
 aath dibbon vaali yah train subah 8 baje dwarka metro stesan se chalakar noida city centre tak pahunchi
 It is worth mentioning that this is the first of eight such coaches of eight coaches to be introduced in a phased manner from Dwarka Sector 21 to Noida City Center and Vaishali Marg

 The young man was brutally murdered
 yuvak kii donon ankhen phod di gayi thim or kaan bhi kaat die
 The youth has not been identified yet

 According to eyewitnesses, the age of the youth is being reported around 20-22 years but the youth has not been identified yet
 aakhir vah yuvak koun tha or kahaan kaa rahane vaala tha? philhal police ne shav ko kabje main lekar postmortem ke liye bhej diya he or puure maamle kii jaanchamen juty hui he
 Now the police is trying to find out who the body is, after interrogating the people around it

 Efforts are on for the release of former Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was imprisoned by the Pakistan Army
 jadhav kii maa avanti sudhir jadhav ne pakistani sainya adaalat ke faisle ke khilaaf apil daayar kii he
 On the other hand, India's High Commissioner in Islamabad Gautam Bambawale has met Pakistan Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua in this connection
 sajaa ke khilaaf apilavanti sudhir jadhav ne pakistan ke army act kii dhara- 133bi ke tahat jadhav ko faansee ke faisle ke khilaaf apil daayar kii he
 Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa and Field General Court Martial (FJCM) have been named as defendants in the appeal
 epagesiem ne hi jadhav ko jasusi or aatankwaad ke aarope main faansee kii sajaa sunai thi
 The decision was approved by General Bajwa on 10 April
 ab aage kya hoga?pakistani kanoon ke mutabik is yachika kii sunwaayee pakistan ke court of apil main hogi
 The Court of Appeal consists of the Chief of the Army of Pakistan or one or two representatives selected by him
 brigadier yaa usase oonche rank kaa afasar is court kii adhyakshata karata he
 But the hearing on the appeal will be possible only after the approval of the Ministry of Defense of Pakistan
 or kya vikalp?haalanki videshmantri sushamaa swaraj ne sansad ko bharosa dilaayaa tha ki kulbhushan jadhav kii rihaai ke liye bharat kisi bhi had tak jayega
 But looking at the attitude of Pakistan, it seems that the government has limited options
 agar ye apil khaarij hoti he to sajaa ke khilaaf civil court main apil kii ja sakati he
 But Pakistan's lawyers have denied Jadhav's plea
 jadhav ke paas aakhri chaara pakistan ke raashtrapati se apil karne kaa he
 At the diplomatic level, Jadhav is likely to be released even if India persuades Islamabad to exchange prisoners
 kai baar aisa hota he ki ham jin chizon kii aalochana karte hai vahi khud bhi karne lagate hai
 i see a reverse troll trending on social media in the context of Union Minister Smriti Irani
 jo trol kii aalochana karte rahe hai wo smriti irani kii aalochana main trol hue ja rahe hai
 Some jokes have been made which are extremely anti-feminist, against the spirit of respect for any work
 charkha chalaanaa or takali kaatna shandaar kaam he
 It is a memorable symbol of our freedom struggle
 jo mulk apana itihaas bhul jaataa he wo aise hi sade gale latifon se apana loktantr chalaata he
 As did a large English newspaper today
 ek stanbhakaar ne smriti ko ahankaar or agyanta kaa mishran bataaya he
 On what basis are scholars becoming so confident about the wisdom and humility of the new minister
 kapadaa mantralay acha mantralay he
 It is also our shortcoming that we combine the entire political experience and discourse to twenty-three leaders, four and a quarter ministries and two and a half parties
 smriti irani kii aalochana bilkul kii jaani chahie magar uskaa aadhaar niti ho, kaam or bayaan ho
 In celebration of his departure, a section is doing strange acts of abandonment of its arguments
 nitigat samaj na hone ke kaaran hi ham vyaktigat badlaav ko badlaav maan lete hai
 Does everyone know what his policies were
 agar thim tab nitiyon ko lekar itani sakriyata kyon nahin dikhi
 Many times the difference between policy and person disappears even when not wanting
 phir bhi smriti irani ke hathaaye jane ko lekar rasranjit samaaj se aagrah he ki ve khud ko raktranjit na karen
 Restrict their removal to their work
 is kram main kapadaa mantralay kaa mazaaq udaaya janaa thik nahin he
 There should be a difference between criticism and condemnation and while sliding before condemnation, keep in mind that we are going to fall into the abyss
 dhyaan rakhiyegaa meri baat
 This trend within you will destroy the democracy earned by centuries of struggle
 apane whats ap or twitor handle ko ek baar phir se dekh lijie
 If you hate Smriti Irani then you are sick
 aap biimaar nahin hai to smriti kii aalochana kar sakate hai
 Now the matter of the court
 kabhi-kabhi adaalaton ke faisle hamen ek behatar loktantric naagarik banane main madad karte hai
 Democracy is a daily process created within us
 chennai hai court ke ek faisla kaa zikr karnaa chahta hum
 In January 2015, Tamil writer Perumal Murugan wrote on his Facebook that the author Perumal Murugan has died
 wo bhagwaan nahin he isliye punerjeevit nahin hoga
 After this, P
 Murugan will live only as a teacher
 murugan ke lekh or upanyaas ko lekar tamilnadu ke namakkal main vivaad hua tha
 Allegations of inciting religious sentiments, increased tension led to a settlement between the district administration and the author under which the author apologized and withdrew his book from the market
 murugan ke kilaaf aapraadhik maamle chalaane or sari kitaaben zabt karne kii do yachika daayar hui
 a single line of the bench of two judges of the Madras High Court has said that it can help us become better democratic citizens
 faisle se pehle jaj sahiban kaa naam lenaa zaruri he
 Chief Justice CJ Kaul and Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana
 jaj sahiban ne donon yachika radd kar di or apane faisle main jo likhaa use main padhanaa chahta hum
 Did not read the entire decision but took it from the Indian Express and News Minutes website
 adaalat kahati he ki lekhak ko punerjeevit hone diya jaae, jisamen wo sabase behatar hai
 Write
 tippaniyan The courts of our country running at a slow pace often show us a better path
 adaalat kah rahi he ki namakkal zila prashasan ke saamne logon or lekhak ke bich jo samjhauta hua tha use maanane ke liye lekhak katai baadhya nahin he
 After this decision, Murugan gave up writing
 adaalat ne kaha he ki murugan ko bhay main nahin rahanaa chahie
 They should write and expand the canvas of their writing
 unka lekhan sahitya main yogadan mana jayega, baavjood iske unase asahmat hone vaale log bhi honge
 But the solution is not to declare the author dead
 wo unka mukt faisla nahin tha balki ek banaai gai sthiti main liya gaya tha
 Justice CJ Kaul wrote that we are confident that Perumal Murugan and his adversaries will learn to follow along and bury their issues as citizens of vibrant democracy move forward
 har lekhan kisi ne kisi ke liye aapattijanak he
 It should not be called indecent indecent, immoral
 kuch latife aise banaae gaye hai jo behad nari virdohi hai, kisi bhi kaam ke prati sammaan kii bhaavana ke kilaaf hai
 The spinning wheel and spinning spindle are excellent work
 hamaari azaadi kii ladaai kaa yaadgaar pratik he
 The country which forgets its history runs its democracy with such rotten hugs
 jaisaa ki aaj angreji ke ek bade akhbaar ne kiya
 One columnist described memory as a mixture of ego and ignorance
 kis aadhaar par vidwaan nae mantri kii vidwata or vinamrata ko lekar itane aashwast ho rahe hai
 The Ministry of Textiles is a good ministry
 ye hamaari bhi kami he ki ham puure raajnneetik anubhav or vimarsh ko paune teen netaa, sava chaar mantralay or dhai party tak samet dete hai
 Smriti Irani should be criticized but it should be based on policy, work and statement
 unke jane ke jashn main ek tabaka apane tarkon kaa tyaag kar ajeeb prakaar kii harakatein kar rahaa he
 Due to lack of policy understanding, we consider personal change as change
 kya sabhi ko maaloom he ki unki kya nitiyaan thim
 If it was then why did not there be so much activism about policies
 kai baar na chaahate hue bhi niti or vyakti main antar mit jaataa he
 Still, Smriti Irani's request to be removed is urged by the society that they should not garnish themselves
 unke hatane ko unke kaam tak hi simit rakhen
 It is not right to mock the Ministry of Textiles in this order
 aalochana or ninda main fark hona chahie or ninda ke aage phisalte vakt dhyaan rakhana chahie ki ham kis khai main girane vaale hai
 Take care of me
 aapke hamaare bheetar pal rahi yah pravriti sadiyon ke sangharsh se arjeet loktantr kaa satyanaash kar degi
 Check your Whats up and Twitter handle once again
 smriti irani se aap nafrat karte hai to aap biimaar hai
 You can criticize memory if you are not ill
 ab adaalat kii baat
 Sometimes the decisions of the courts help us to be a better democratic citizen
 loktantrikta hamaare bheetar banane vaali rose kii ek prakriya he
 i want to refer to a decision of the Chennai High Court
 janvari 2015 main tamil lekhak perumal murugan ne apane fasebuk par likhaa tha ki lekhak perumal murugan mar gaya he
 He is not God, so will not be revived
 ab iske baad pi murugan sirf ek teacher ke rup main jivit rahegaa
 There was a controversy in Namakkal, Tamil Nadu over Murugan's article and novel
 dharmik bhavanaaen bhadakaane ke aarope lage, tanaav badha to zila prashasan ne virodhiyon or lekhak ke bich samjhauta karaayaa jiske tahat lekhak ne maafee maangi or bazaar se apni kitaab waapas le lee
 Two petitions were filed against Murugan for criminal cases and forfeiture of all books
 madras hoicourt ke do jajon kii jo bench ne kaha he uski ek ek pankti hamen behatar loktantric naagarik banane main madad kar sakati he
 It is necessary to name Judge Sahiban before the verdict
 chif justise si je kaul or justise puspa sathyanarayan
 Judge Sahiban quashed both the petition and i want to read what he wrote in his judgment
 puraa faisla nahin padhaa lekin indian express or news minute website se liya he
 The court says that the author should be revived, in which he is the best
 likho
 The comments dhimi gati se chalane vaali hamaare mulk kii adaalatein kai baar hamen behatar rasta dikhaa detii hai
 The court is saying that the writer is not bound to accept the agreement reached between the people and the writer before the Namakkal district administration
 isi faisle ke baad murugan ne likhnaa chhod diya tha
 The court has said that Murugan should not live in fear
 unhen likhnaa chahie or apane lekhan ke canvas kaa vistaar karnaa chahie
 His writing will be considered a contribution to literature, despite this there will be people who disagree with him
 magar iskaa hal yah nahin he ki lekhak khud ko mara hua ghoshit kar de
 That was not their free decision but was taken in a created situation
 justise si je kaul ne likhaa he ki hamen bharosa he ki perumal murugan ou unke virdohi saath saath chalanaa seekhenge or apane muddon ko dafnaayenge jaisaa aage badhate hue jeevant loktantr ke naagarik hote hai
 Every writing is offensive to someone

 Those who visit Vrindavan often know about the Nidhivan here, that this is the same forest, where Lord Shri Krishna composed Raas and Gopis in Dwaparyuga

 The mention of this forest is also found in the Puranas
 yahaan shri radharani kii ashtasakhiyon main pradhan lalita sakhi ne bhi avatar liya tha
 Staying or going to this Nidhivan at night is forbidden
 iske liye baqayada yahaan bairicade kar di jaati he
 but why? is kyon kaa jawaab mathura-vrindavan ke bade-bujurg dete hai
 If people believe that even today, Lord Krishna creates raslila here with gopis, which is forbidden to see human beings
 log bataate hai ki jo bhi is raasalila kii mahaj ek jhalak bhi dekh letaa he, vah veikshipt yani pagal ho jaataa he
 That is why it is completely forbidden to go to Nidhivan after dusk
 or to or, log bataate hai ki raat ke samay nidhivan ke aas-paas pashu-pakshi bhi nahin rahete hai
 Another specialty of Nidhivan is the trees here, which are amazing
 yahaan ped kii shakhaaen upar kii ore na badhkar neeche kii ore badhati hai
 There is a temple of Shri Radhaji in Nidhivan itself
 jo chor radharani mandir ke naam se poojit he
 There is also a sacred kund, which is known as Visakha Kund

 ) The Center for Science and Environment has claimed that the honey sold in India is spoiling your health
 ye shahad bimariyon se ladane kii aapaki kshamta khatm kar rahaa he
 That is, the result may be that after eating honey, your disease is not curable
 shahad doodh ke saath piyo to takat badhata he
 If you drink honey with lemonade, obesity decreases
 bachapan se sunate aae hai ki shahad main kai gun hai
 By taking honey, both taste and health can be taken care of
 is doctor ise paushtik aahaar bataate hai
 This is also true because honey contains a treasure of health
 jamaane se hamaare khaane main shahad mithaas gholta aayaa he
 But now in the race for making profits, bitterness has dissolved in this honey
 badi-badi companiyaan is shahad ke jariye hamaari sehat se khuleam khilwaad kar rahi hai
 a survey on honey has been conducted by the Center for Science and Environment, a Delhi-based NGO
 is survey kii report daraane vaali he
 It claims that honey of almost every big company in the market is dangerous for your health
 report ke mutabik tamaam companiyon ke shahad main antibiotic kii kaaphi maatra pai gai he
 There are antibiotics that are banned in honey
 centre for science and enwyronement yani siesai ne desh main bikne vaale 12 nami brands ke shahad kii jaanch kaa daawa kiya he
 CSE states that two or more antibiotics have been found in the honey of 11 of these brands
 jin 12 brands ke shahad kii jaanch kii gai he usamen do videshi bhi hai
 One brand is from Australia and the other is from Switzerland
 siesai kaa daawa he ki bharat main bikne vaale in videshi brads main bhi do se adhik antibiotic paae gaye hai
 According to doctors, the presence of antibiotics in honey is dangerous for health
 isse bimariyon se ladane kii sharir kii kshamta khatm ho jaati he
 The biggest problem is that by eating honey daily, antibiotics go into such quantities in the body, medicines can stop the effect
 nateeja yah kii bimaariyaan laailaaj ho sakati hai
 All treatment attempts can fail
 itnaa hi nahin antibiotic ghule shahad se aapkaa sharir khun se judi bimariyon kaa bhi shikaar ho saktaa he
 It can also have an effect on liver and kidney
 bada sawaal yah he ki aakhir kahaan se pahunchataa he madhumakhiyon se nikalne vaale shahad main antibiotic
 According to experts, the reason for this is the competition for earning profits
 madhumakhiyon kii taadaat bade auki unhen koi beemaari na hon iske liye madhumakhi paalane vaale unhen antibiotic ke dose dete hai
 This antibiotic reaches the human body
 siesai kaa daawa he ki shahad bechney main bhi badi companiya doharaa ravaiya apanaati hai
 Honey sent abroad does not contain antibiotics
 lekin jab yaheen companiyaan bharat main shahad bechati hai to usamen antibiotic pai jaati he
 Obviously, the law in India takes advantage and these companies play with our health and yours
 yani jis shahad ko aap sehat kaa khajaana maanakar abtak khate aae hai vahi shahad aapke sharir ko khokhla kar rahen he
 The CSE report is warning us to avoid this honey
 halaki shahad banane vaali companiyaan daawa kar rahi hai ki wo sarkaar ke banaae sabhi niyamon kaa paalan karti ai hai
 Some companies also claim that the government has no provision for antibiotic checking

 logon ke man me uth rahe sawaalon kii jhalak saahani ke antim sanskaar main aae logon ke chehre par saaf najar aayaa
 The same question in everyone's mind, why did Rajesh Sahni, who is very calm and reconciled, finally committed suicide? These questions are arising in the mind of the people- The biggest question is why did Rajesh Sahni come to his office despite being on leave? What happened to Rajesh Sawhney, who came calmly from home, and finally shot him by asking for a service revolver from his driver? - His people say that he is very well a wanted man
 aakhir kya hua ki unhen aatmahatya kerani padi?- kya unhen koi oficial problem thi? yaa phir gharelu uljhan se jujh rahe the?- unhone marane se pehle kis se aakhri baar baat kii thi?- aakhirkaar aties ke daftar me bagal ke kamare main rajesh saahani ke goli maarane ke baavjood kisi ko uski aawaaj sunai kyon nahi di?- jis kamare me rajesh ne goli maari us kamare me do daravaaje hai

 aakhir aisa kyon tha?- rajesh saahani ke goli maarane ko bare me pataa chalate hi aties ke saathi unhen fouran aspataal lekar kyon nahin gaye?- goli lagane ke baad jaanch ke liye privet aspataal se doctor kyon bulaayaa gaya, jabaki lohia aspataal paas main hi he?- rajesh saahani kii deadbody chaar ghante aties ke daftar main hi kyon padi rahi?- jis dryver ne saahani ko revolver laakar di, use aakhir adhikari saamne aane se kyon roak rahe hai?- aakhirkaar itane sulajhe hue vyakti ne khudakushi se pehle koi sucite note kyon nahin choda?

 Asaram is accused of raping the girl in August 2013 at his ashram in Jodhpur
 31 agast, 2013 ko asaram ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha, tab se yah chhathi baar he jab unki jamaanat yachika naamanzoor kar di gai he or isaki vajah pramukh gavaahon par lagaataar ho rahe jaanaleva hamale hai
 The testimony of these people is very important in three different rape cases
 inamen se do maamle jodhpur or ahmedabad main asaram ke khilaaf hai jabaki ek maamla asaram ke bete narayan sai ke khilaaf surat main darj he
 Like Asaram, Narayan Sai is also a self-proclaimed saint
 asaram maamalon ke gavaahon par hone vaale hamalon ke tareeke bilkul kisi mafia ke hamalon jaise hai
 So far, two witnesses have been killed and some others have been crippled in firing, acid throwing and knife attacks
 ye gavaah haryana ke panipat, uttar pradesh ke mujffarnagar, gujarat ke surat or rajkot or madhya pradesh ke hoshangabad ke rahane vaale the, jinhen hamalaavaron ne khoj nikaala
 Despite the similarity in the attacks, the police have so far failed to link him with Asaram or his son
 surat police pichley saal gavaahon par hue hamale kii teen ghatnaon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 He has received indications of Asaram's seekers being involved in these incidents of violence
 16 march, 2014 ko motorcycle savaar do logon ne dinesh bhagachandani par tejaab phenk diya tha
 Bhagchandani, once very close to Asaram, is now the prime prosecution witness in the case
 hamalaavaron main se ek kishor bodke ko ghatnasthal par maujuud logon ne pakad liya tha, jisane police ko bataaya ki usne karnataka ke bijapur ke rahane vaale or asaram ke bhakt basavaraj basu ke kehane par yah hamalaa kiya tha
 Police has also received a slip from Bodke which has written the names of six witnesses living in Gujarat

 formed to investigate these allegations
 ke
 The attack came a few days after he testified before the Trivedi Commission
 chandak asaram ke khilaaf ahmedabad main darj balaatkaar ke maamle main bhi gavaah he
 The sixth name in the list of witnesses recovered from Bodke is that of Narasimh Vatwani, who is living in constant panic
 surat police ke jaanchakartaaon kaa kahana he ki bodke motera ashram main asaram kaa nijee sevak tha
 He used to stay with Asaram even during his travels
 poochtacha main bodke ne asaram maamalon ke gavaahon ko khatm karne kii sajeesh kaa khulaasa kiya he
 Bodke has also indicated involvement of some more people in this conspiracy and in interrogation has stated that he and his partner Chandrasekhar were involved in the attack on three of the five witnesses & Bhagchandani, Patel and Thakkar
 chandrashekhar bhi bhagachandani par tejabi hamale kii ghatana ke kuch din pakadaa gaya tha
 Both Bodke and Chandrasekhar got bail, but they had made many important revelations while in police custody and many important information came to the hands of the police
 unhone police ko bataaya ki gavaahon ko khamosh karne kii is sajeesh main basu ke alaava asaram ashram ke varisht padaadhikari sunil vankhede or shailendra bhi shaamil the
 These two are fugitives
 poochtacha main yah bhi pataa chalaa ki basu or sejal (jo vafaadaar sadhika he) ne asaram ke gusse se bachane ke liye surat main abhiyojan paksh ke gavaahon se haath mila liya tha
 He had also given interviews on local TV channels claiming that he was being intimidated by the Ashram
 is tarah ve surat kii un do bahanon ke parijanon kaa vishwaas hasil karne main kaamyaab ho gaye jinhone asaram par balaatkaar kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 According to police officials, the couple took advantage of their proximity to the victims to help them target Bodke and his companions
 surat ko chhodkar baaki sabhi sthanon par, jahaan gavaahon par hamalaa hua he yaa unki hatya tak kar di gai he, un maamalon kii jaanch main police ke haath koi khaas kamyaabi nahin lagi he
 With this, there is also a possibility that fear will be penetrated in the minds of those who are yet to witness
 asaram kaa rasoiyaa rah chuke 36 varshiya akhil gupta kii, jisane apane grihnagar mujffarnagar lautakar deyari khol lee thi, isi saal 11 janvari ko motorcycle savaar do agyaat logon ne goli markar hatya kar di
 He was a witness in a rape case in the Ahmedabad ashram
 13 may ko 37 varshiya mahendra chawla ke saath bhi thik isi tarah ke hamale kii koshish hui
 Chawla worked as a personal assistant to Narayan Sai till July 2005 and is a key witness in all three cases filed against Asaram and Sai
 is hamale main chawla bal-bal batch gaye
 It is only by remembering that incident that Chawla's hair grows
 ve kehete hai, “mujhe khamosh kar dene ke liye ve baichen ho rahe hai
 Chawla was attacked outside his father's house in Sanoli village
 us samay chawla ghar par akele the jab unhone daravaaje ke baahar aawaaj suni
 He says, "it was nine in the morning
 aawaaj kiski he yah dekhne ke liye maine darwaja kholaa
 Two young men of about twenty years were standing outside, holding desi katta in their hands
 ve daravaaje ko dhakelte hue andar aa gaye or chillaaye, “saale, narayan sai ke khilaaf gavaahi detaa he?” chawla ko yah samajhate der nahin lagi ki ve donon unhen khatm karne aae hai or unhone turant katte kii nalee pakad lee
 The first bullet went into the wall
 idhar, chawla ghar kii oonchi munder ko paar kar bhaagane kii koshish kar hi rahe the ki hamlawar ne duusari goli daag di
 He says, "just remember that a very loud sound came and felt that i had been shot
 ” chawla ko baayen kandhe main goli lagi or ve behosh hokar gir pade
 The attackers fled, assuming they were dead
 panipat ke aspataal main kai hafte bhartee rahane ke baad ghar laut chuke chawla kii suraksha ke liye ab haryana police ke teen hathiyaarband sipaahi tainaat rahete hai
 a month after Gupta's murder in Muzaffarnagar, 41-year-old Rahul Sachan, a witness in the Jodhpur rape case, was tried to kill him with a knife in the district court premises
 13 farvari ko sachaan adaalat main sunwaayee ke liye pesh hua tha, gupta or chawla, donon ke hamalavar to bhaag nikle lekin sachaan kaa hamalavar satyanarayan gwaala giraft main aa gaya
 Gwala worked in the Jodhpur ashram of Asaram, yet the Rajasthan police failed to sniff out any major conspiracy
 ardh viklang ho chuke sachaan jab se apane ghar lakhanu laute hai tab se gahare avsaad main hai
 The Uttar Pradesh Police has provided only one security guard to Sachan, who has endured the deadly attack, and that too for eight hours a day, Sachan will have to take responsibility for his security for the remaining 16 hours
 idhar, ahmedabad main asaram par apane pati kii hatya kaa saarvajanik rup se aarope lagane vaali prajapati kii patni saroj bhi rahasyamay dhang se laapata ho gai he
 Interestingly, all the four possible attackers whom Prajapati had named have been omitted as they could not be blamed
 chawla kehete hai ki haryana police ne dhamkiyon ko gambhirtha se nahin liya
 After the killing of Akhil Gupta, security guards were stationed outside his house in Sanoli after the Gujarat Police's constant messages from Surat and Ahmedabad headquarters
 lekin 13 may ko jab hamalavar aae tab guard maukey se nadaarad tha
 He got better security after this incident but the Panipat police is not showing any special interest in finding the attackers
 chawla ke mutabik, jin sambhavit hamalaavaron ke naam unhone police ko bataae the unamem se ek ko bhi poochtacha ke liye nahin bulaayaa gaya he

 haalanki, apane is faisle ke saath court ne yah bhi kah diya ki floor test main shaamil hone ke liye istipha de chuke vidhayakon ko baadhya nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In such a situation, the matter has become very complicated now and the discussion has started again whether the HD Kumaraswamy government of congress-jds alliance will survive or not
 supreme court ne gend spikar ke paale main daal di he, aise main naa to vidhayakon ke istife par faisla ho paaya or naa hi ayogyata par
 In such a situation, this game has become completely dependent on floor tests

 aise main kumaraswami sarkaar ke saamne bahumat sabit karne kii chunauti he
 The rebel mlas who are adamant on resigning have a choice whether to go to the assembly at the time of the floor test
 haalanki, congress kii ore se vip jari kiya gaya he, lekin court ke faisle ke baad vakil mukul rohtagi ne bataaya ki vidhayakon par congress kaa vip lagu nahin hoga
 - Karnataka Assembly has a total of 224 seats
 inamen congress ke paas sirf 100 vidhayak hai
 While the BJP has a total of 105 mlas, the BJP also claims the support of independent mlas
 congress: 79 – 13 = 66jedies: 37 – 3 = 34basapa: 1congress + jedies = 100congress + jedies + basapa: 101bijepi: 105nirdaleey: 1KPJP: 116 vidhayak jo istipha de chuke hanek vot spikar kaa he, jo sirf us sthiti main vot karte hai jab voton kii sankhya floor test main baraabar ho jaae
 Now if the speaker disqualifies the mlas or accept their resignation

 Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh, is known for communal harmony and ganga-jamuni tehzeeb, but 'hindutva' has started becoming an election issue after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) nominated Sadhvi Pragya Thakur as its candidate
 bhopal sansadeey kshetra se lagbhag ek maah pehle congress ne purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh ko ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya tha
 Singh has been interacting with various parts and sections of the capital for the past 25 days, giving details of his upcoming plans
 singh lagaataar sanbhalkar or sadhe hue kadam badaye ja rahe hai, yahi kaaran he ki unki ore se ek bhi vivaadit bayaan nahin aayaa he
 The BJP on Wednesday hinted at making a big change in political fiasco by nominating Sadhvi Pragya Thakur, accused of Malegaon blast
 varisht raajnneetik vishleshak shiv anuraag pateria ne kaha, "bijepi dhruvikaran chaahati he, isi ke chalate usne bhagava vastradhari pragna thakur ko maidan main utaara he
 BJP really wants to send a message through Pragya Thakur to the whole country that Digvijay Singh is a minority supporter, Congress is anti-hindu 
 pragna ko hindutv peedit bataane kii bhi koshish hogi or bhaajapa bhopal main is chunaav ko anya muddon kii bajaay dhruvikaran karke ladanaa chaahati he
 As soon as Pragya becomes a candidate, there are signs of bjp's strategy
 "bhopal sansadeey kshetra ke itihaas par najar daudai jaae to pataa chalata he ki varsh 1984 ke baad se yahaan bhaajapa kaa kabja he
 The Congress has won six times in the 16 elections held so far in the Bhopal Parliamentary constituency
 bhopal main 12 may ko matdaan hone vaala he
 Bhopal parliamentary constituency has 19
5 million voters, including four lakh Muslims, three and a half lakh Brahmins, four and half lakh backward classes, two lakh Kayasthas and 1
25 lakh Kshatriyas
 matadaataaon ke isi ganit ko dhyaan main rakhkar congress ne digvijay singh ko maidan main utaara tha, magar bhaajapa ne pragna thakur ko ummidavaar banaakar dhruvikaran kaa daanv khelaa he
 The Bhopal parliamentary constituency has eight assembly seats
 lagbhag chaar maah pehle hue vidhansabha ke chunaav main bhaajapa ne aath main se paanch or congress ne teen siten jiti
 Therefore, despite the change in government, the BJP had more success in the assembly segments of Bhopal parliamentary constituency than the Congress
 digvijay singh bhi pragna kii upasthiti se siyaasi maahaul main aane vaale badlaav ko pehle hi bhaanp gaye the, yahi kaaran he ki unhone pragna kaa swaagat karte hue ek video sandesh jari kiya tha
 While Singh himself is openly avoiding attacking Pragya, he is giving similar instructions to the activists
 singh ko yah ahsaas he ki maalegaanv bam dhamaake or pragna par sidhe taur par koi hamalaa hota he to chunavi disha badal sakati he
 Singh is giving the road map of the development of Bhopal and the details of the work done during his tenure
 ummidavaari ghoshit hone ke baad pragna ke mizaaj talkh hone lage hai or matadaataaon ko bhaavnaatmak taur par lubhaane main jute gai he
 He accused the Congress of being anti-hindu and at the same time made references to Hindutva terrorism and saffron terrorism and started giving details of police harassment after being accused of Malegaon bomb blast
 ve logon ke bich bhavuk bhi ho rahi hai
 On the one hand, Pragya has started to advance her campaign and on the other hand Congress leaders are also responding in their own way
 rajya ke ucch shiksha mantri jitu patawaari ne digvijay singh ko raajnneetik sant bataate hue kaha, "digvijay singh ne hidutv ko jiyaa he, maanavtaa kii seva kii he, narmada nadi kii parikrama kii he
 He is indeed a saint of politics
 "jaankaron kii maane to bhopal ke chunaav main dhruvikaran kii sambhaavna ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa
 Every effort will be made by the Congress to prevent polarization in some way, Digvijay Singh is going to build his image by going to religious places himself, and on the other hand BJP has started calling Digvijay Singh as Muslim pro-muslim and anti-hindu
 vahiin pragna ko congress dwaara satai gai hindu mahila ke rup main prastut kiya ja rahaa he

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) aaj se kareeb 27 saal pehle vah 23 saal kaa tha jab rupahale parde par use pehla brake mila
 The first name on the golden screen was 'vicky Bhandari', a gray character
 ek saal baad hi 1989 main isi parde ne use pehali badi or blockbster safalataa dilaai or vah 'prem' ban gaya
 In the last 27 years, Salman's image was also made of Devil with love in both reel and real life and upon seeing it, he went to 'bhaijaan'
 aagaamee 27 disambar ko salmaan khan apana 50waan janmdin manaayenge, lekin usase 17 din pehle hi unhen vah saugat mili he, jiske liye vah beete 13 varshon se baichaiyn the
 In the 2002 hit and run case, the Bombay High Court has acquitted Salman Khan of all charges, after 13 years, giving a verdict at 1:33 pm on Thursday
 yakeenan salmaan kii jindagi main yah pehla aisa faisla he, jisane unhen sabake adhik sukun pahunchaaya he
 As much as the stories of the movies of this star of Indian cinema have been entertaining, exciting and full of emotions, their real life story is more interesting than that
 27 disambar 1965 ko indore main paidaa hue salmaan apane pita saleem khan kii tarah ek patakatha lekhak bananaa chaahate the, lekin cinemai kariyar actor ke taur par chal niklaa
 However, it is a strange coincidence that in the last 27 years, unknowingly, Salman wrote a screenplay of his life that has everything from love to wrangling, arsh to floor and larger than life
 pehali film, pehali blockbstersalmaan khan kii pehali film 1988 main 'bivi ho to aisi' thi, jisamen unhone faruk shaikh ke bhai or rekha ke devar kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa tha
 The thin-skinned Salman only worked on the screen to introduce him, but in 1989, for the first time as a hero, 'maine Pyaar Kiya' made him an overnight star
 nirdeshak suraj badjatya kii bhi yah pehali film thi
 The first action avatar was Saajan in the film 'baaghi' released in 1990 and then Sooraj Verma's character in 'patthar Ke Phool' in 1991, Salman's action avatar was presented to everyone
 iske baad 1992 main ai 'jagriti' unki pehali phul-packed ection film kahi ja sakati he
 Salman's next film was beaten a year after giving blockbusters like 'main Pyaar Kiya' in 1989, the first flop film
 1990 main ai 'baagi' na to box offis chali or na hi logon ke dilon main jagah bana pai
 However, in the very next year 1991, 'sanam Bewafa' again tasted success
 pehali multi starer filmasalamaan ke kariyar main mashhoor jodi ke taur bhale hi hameshaa charchaa 'amar-prem' or 'karan-arjuna' kii hoti he, lekin pehali baar unhone film 'saajan' main apane kareebi dost dutt ke saath screen saajha kiya tha
 'saajan' proved to be the biggest hit of 1991
 salmaan aamir khan ke saath 'andaaj apana apana' or shahrukh khan ke saath 'karan-arjuna or ham tumhaare hai sanam' main kaam kar chuke hai
 Salman, who was the first film writer to touch the heights in the cinematic world, has also written the story of cinema on several occasions
 yakeenan yah hameshaa se unki chahat rahi, lekin 1991 main 'baagi' ho yaa 1993 main 'chandramukhi' or 2010 main ai 'vir' inamen se koi bhi film salmaan ke is paksh ko nikhaar paane par asafal rahi
 All three films were badly beaten
 pehla special apiyarensasaal 1996 main mahmud kii film 'dushman duniya kaa' main salmaan khan pehali baar mehmaan kalakaar ke taur par dikhe
 Shah Rukh Khan was in the lead role in this film
 iske baad vah 1997 main 'divaana mastaana', 1999 main 'sirf tum' or 2000 main 'dhai akshar prem ke' jaisi kai filmon main najar aaen
 First-time love Haslaman Khan's life has also been in discussion due to his girlfriends
 is kaaran vah media ke liye bed bvoy bhi bane
 This most beautiful and attractive star of Indian cinema has had many girlfriends (friends in Salman's words)
 lekin unki pehali premika 90 ke dashak main pakistani actress somi ali thim
 The two dated each other for a long time, while the relationship broke up in 1999
 iske baad salmaan kii sangeeta bijlani, aishwarya raay, katrina caff ke saath prem sambandhon kii bhi khub charchaa rahi
 100 Crore Club's debut film, Salman Khan is the box office's Sartaj
 bhartiya cinema jagat main unke naam lagaataar 9 aisi filmein hai jo 100 karod, 200 karod or 300 karod club main shaamil hai
 'hum Aapke Hain Kaun', which came out in 1994, made a record at the box office
 is film ne tab 70 karod rupee kii kamai kii thi, jo ek record he
 The record of this film was broken by Sunny Deol's 2001 film Gadar: Ek Prem Katha
 haalanki, in sab ke upar 2010 main ai 'dabang' 100 karod club main shaamil hui
 The film debuted 100 Crore Club and then Salman gave back-to-back 9 superhit films
 salmaan ke saath pehla vivadsalamaan khan kaa puraa kariyar vivaadon ke kaaran bhi charchaa main rahaa he
 If the star is big then even the smallest thing becomes big
 haalanki, sabase bada maamla 2002 kaa hit and ran cese hi he, jisamen 13 saal baad guuruuvaar ko faisla aayaa he
 Apart from this, the case of black deer in Jodhpur during the shooting of the film 'hum Saath Saath Hain' in 1999 also remains an issue for Salman Khan
 real life main pehali baar jail kii sarasalamaan par lage sangeen aaropon kaa maamla sirf court-kachhari tak simit nahin he
 He has also been jailed for three days in 2006 in the case of black deer
 jodhpur kii adaalat 10 april 2006 ko unhen doshi maanate hue tab 5 saal kaid kii sajaa sunai thi or nruyik hiraasat main bhej diya tha
 After this, on April 13, he was released on bail

 After studying the Bofors deal for nearly 27 years, a parliamentary committee has insisted the CBI avoid political interference in matters related to the purchase of howitzer cannon
 bijedy saansad bhatruhari mehataab kii adhyakshata vaali chah sadasyeey public acounts cameti (piesi) kii sab cameti (sansadeey up samiti) ne boforce par report ko sweekaar kar liya he
 This report will also be tabled in Parliament in the next session
 sutron ke mutabik cameti ne mana he ki isse jude tamaam record or dastavejon ko sambhalakar rakhane main kotahi barti gai
 On requesting the documents, again and again the excuse was given that the matter is under consideration of the court
 cameti ne paaya ki puure system ne dhilaai barti or raajnneetik dramebaaji hi chalati rahi
 The committee has said that the ministry should create a system under which there is a provision for investigation in a fixed time frame if there are objections to the audit
 piesi ne is baat par bhi dukh jataayaa ki puure ghatnakram main jaanch se judi sansthaaon or logon ne samjhaute kiye
 The committee said that all such institutions connected with the investigation should get out of politics and handle their responsibilities in a better way
 cameti ne paaya ki sarkaar ke tamaam angon ke bich talmail kii kami thi
 He also expressed deep concern over the investigation agencies not collecting evidence
 cameti ne paaya ki ection teken nots bhejne main bhi mantralayon ne bahut der kii he
 The PAC sub-committee may have accepted the report, but the chairman of the pac's main committee is Lok Sabha MP Malika Arjun Kharge, leader of the Congress Party
 ab dekhnaa he ki wo piesi ke adhyaksh ke naate boforce maamle par sab cameti kii report ko sweekaar karte hai yaa nahin
 Some similar situations came before the PAC committee on the 2G spectrum scam in 2011
 tab cameti ke adhyaksh murali manhor joshi chaahate the ki report ko cameti sweekaar kare lekin tab congress, diemke, samaajawaadee or anyaupie sarkaarake samarthak dalon ne sankhya bal ke dam par report kaa virodh karte hue ek prastaav paas kar diya tha
 Most of the members of a committee did not agree with the report and the matter went to Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar
 tab mira kumaar ne report ko kaarij kar diya tha or report ko phir se taiyaar karne ke aadesh die the
 According to the sources, if Mallika Arjun Kharge rejects the report as the chairman of the committee, then the BJP is preparing to take the matter to the Lok Sabha speaker by passing the proposal to accept the report in the committee on the basis of numbers

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has fiercely targeted the Modi government at the Center
 sattadhari aam aadmi ke vidhayakon par giri gaaj ko party ke netaa kejariwal ne sajeesh qaraar diya
 In a message to the people of Delhi, Kejriwal said that for the last few days, the suppression cycle has been going on the Aam Aadmi Party, efforts are being made to crush it
 hamaare 10 vidhayakon ko giraftaar kar chuke hai or 1 vidhayak ke ghar pe red padavai gai he
 Not only this, Kejriwal has made an open attack on the Nemodi government saying that 'we have tried to disqualify our 21 mlas by calling them false true office of profit and they suspended one of our mps
 ye puri tarah daman kaa chakra he
 The ACB is investigating Satyendra Jain and Manish Sisodia daily
 'AAP ke saath ho rahi he jyadatikageriwal iitne par nahin ruke unhone kaha ki 'main soch rahaa tha aisa kyon ho rahaa he
 Some people say that Arvind, you take Modi ji's name every day, he is not getting all this done
 ye jo inakam tex department, sibiai peeche padi he inke peeche koi to master mind hoga
 Who is that mastermind, Amit Shah, Modi ji or PMO? They are all together
 modi jinke kehane par amit shah kara rahe hai
 The public is saying that it is not going well, it is getting too much
 isse janata main nakaaratmak sandesh ja rahaa he
 "modi has gone mad" Kejriwal intensified the attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that "modi ji has been furious inside, very angry
" wo logic se nahin soch rahe kyonki iskaa koi tark nahin banataa
 The number of mlas caught, they come out of the exemption in 2 days
 ek maamla bhi sabit nahin ho paaya
 The court has also leveled
 ye log ek bhi cese main dosha sabit nahin kar paae
 The Prime Minister is not acting with brains and is stunned
 kuch log kehete hai kyonki dilli main kaam acha chal rahaa he
 The central government does not work, compared to Delhi
 kuch log kehete hai ki piem modi dilli kii haar ko pachaa nahin paa rahe hai, kuch log kah rahe hai goa, gujarat or punjab main jo hamen samarthan mil rahaa he usase baukhalaaye hue hai
 'scandal on Modi's foreign policy, Kejriwal further said,' It is clear that the Prime Minister is taking decisions in anger and fury
 ye mere liye chintaa kaa vishay he
 If the leader of the country starts taking angry decisions then it is a matter of danger for that country
 hamaare vidhayak ko pakadakar jail main daal do
 Questioning Modi's foreign policy, Kejriwal said what happened to Nepal had centuries of friendship with it
 aaj nepal ke saath rishte achche nahin hai
 Kejriwal also suggested Modi government, calling Modi a failure on every front
 unhone kaha modi raajnneetik satta hathiyanna chaahate hai jo galat baat nahin hai
 But power is taken in two ways, do good work and the public will support you
 bijepi or pradhanmantri modi ji har front par fail ho gaye hai
 Traders, students, Dalits, minorities, farmers, jewelers, youth are angry all over the country
 mahangaai itani bad gai he, logon ke dhandhe band hote ja rahe hai
 Another way to take power is to crush your opponents
 ek-ek karke sari party ko kuchal diya
 Never dare another party to raise its voice
 daliton ne aawaaj uthaai dalit ko kuchal diya
 Rohit Vemula, crushed the farmers
 aam aadmi party ko kuchalane main koi kami nahin chodi
 But we could not crush our spirits
 'AAP ke liye mushkil samykejariwal ne aakhir main kaha ki 'saare vidhayak, samarthak or mantriyon ko kahana chahta hum ki ye mushkil samay he
 Talk to all of you family, Daman is going to get dirty in the coming time
 ye mujhe bhi marava sakate hai
 Be ready to sacrifice anything other than jail can happen, if you are ready, stay together, if there is weakness then leave it

 Premium charges apply !! har naagarik swasth ho, desh main rahane vaale har naagarik ko ucchtam swasthya suvidhaayen kam daamon main milen, kuch isi makasad se khole gaye hai jan aushadhi centre
 This is such a project of the Prime Minister, whose goal is that even the poorer sections of the society can get all medicines at affordable prices
 lekin rajdhani dilli main ajtak kii padtaal se pataa chalata he ki jan aushadhi kendron kaa tantra khud biimaar padaa he or sasti dawaaen to log dhundhate hi rah jaaenge
 According to the paper, there are 25 centers in Delhi
 Last year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had announced in the General Budget that 3000 such centers will be opened in different states across the country in a year
 rajdhani dilli kii agar baat karen to yahaan bipipiai yani beuro of pharma piesu of india kii website ke mutabik kul 25 centre hai
 These centers are divided into areas such as Central, North, South, East, West, North East, North West, South West, South East
 website ke mutabik in kendron main 750 se bhi zyada davaaiyaan uplabdh hai
 These are medicines which are usually available at prices of 80 to 90 percent less than local drug stores
 yani bukhaar kii dawaai kaa ek patta jo aapako bazaar main 14-15 rupee kaa miltaa he vah in jan aushadhi centre main kareeb 2 rupee tak kaa milegaa
 This list also includes medicines for serious diseases like cancer, whose prices are usually in the thousands in the market
 zaahir he ki in kedron kaa sidhaa phayda un aam logon ko milanaa chahie jo mahangi or branded davaaiyaan nahin kharid sakate hai, lekin kya vaaki aam logon ko is suvidha kaa phayda ho rahaa he? kya website par di gai sari davaaiyaan mil raheen hai
 What is the truth of the Centre's claims of health facilities to the people? When we investigated the answers to these questions, the shocking truth came out
 logon ko pataa hi nahin in kendron ke bare memrajdhani dilli main 25 centre hai
 Our team investigated these Jan Aushadhi Centers running in the Central, South, East and West zones of Delhi and the truth that came out reveals the claims of the Central Government
 dilli ke dil main basaa he ram manohar lohia aspataal
 People come from all over the country to get treatment at this hospital in Delhi
 aaramail aspataal ke thik peeche dawaaiyon kii kai dukaane hai
 Seeing the crowd at these shops, it can be guessed that patients need good and cheap medicines
 isse bhi zyada hamaare liye chaunkaane vaali baat ye thi ki aaramail aspataal ke main get number 4 par hi ek jan aushadhi centre he, to phir yahaan par itani bheed kyon lagi he
 
 
 When we talked to the people here, most of the people did not know about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra
 dawaai lene pahuche pankaj ne bataaya- 'main hameshaa dawaai yaheen se letaa hum, mujhe nahin pataa is centre ke bare main'
 At the same time, Manoj said- 'complete medicines are not available in the center
 4 main se ek hi dawaai mili he
 'there is a subway in front of Gate No
 4 of RML on Baba Kharak Singh Marg, where there is a mass medicine center
 yahaan dukandaar ne bataaya, 'doctor or compounder to kuch bhi likh dete hai, lekin main kahaan se dawaai duungaa, saare salts hamaare paas bhi nahin hote hai
 We keep some medicines according to demand
 ' isse saaf pataa chalata he ki doctoron or in kendron ke bich aapasi talmail na hone kaa khamiyaaza marizo ko hi uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 Now some papers are in the center, this is the condition of the largest hospital in the capital, so you have to guess what will happen in the rest of the city
 rajdhani dilli ke mayur vihaar ilaake main acharya niketan market main har do dukaanon ke baad ek chemist shop mil jaaegi
 According to bppi's website, there is a mass medicine center in the Shiva Arcade of this market
 lekin yahaan ke sthaneey nivaasiyon ko iske bare main koi jaankaree nahin he
 After hard work, when we finally reached the address given on the website, we were stunned to see that there was no mass medicine center there
 dukandaar ne bataaya, 'abhi start nahin kiya he, 10 din ke baad chaalu ho jayega, jiesti kii vajah se purana stock nahin nikaalnaa he
 'health facilities reaching the people are not reaching the general public
 kahin jaankaree kii kami to kahin puri davaaiyaan nahin
 One by one, when the layers were opened, it was proved to what extent this central government scheme is actually running on paper and on the ground
 south dilli main jab ham jan aushadhi centre kaa sach jaanane pahunche to hamen dhundhane par ye mil to gaya, lekin hamen is centre par bada-sa taala lataka mila
 Local resident Shankar said- 'this shop is closed for the last 15 days, we do not know why it is closed'
 vahiin west dilli ke sabase bade aspataal deen dayaal upaadhyahospataal kihalat or zyada kharaab thi
 There is a Jan Aushadhi Center inside the hospital
 yahandwai lene aapshok ne bataaya- 'doctor ne kaha tha ki sari davaaiyaan yahaan mil jaaegi, lekin sirf ek mili he baaki dawaai majaburi main baahar se leni padegi'
 The shopkeeper told- 'the medicines are out of stock for the last 7 days
 'kuch centre sirf kaagajon par mili, kuch mili to aise jinhe dhundhana mushkil
 Those who found it easy could not find medicines or hang the lock
 yani aam logon ke liye sasti dawa paanaa ek sapane se kam nahin
 The question is whether it is not the duty of the government to make this facility available to the people as well as to give complete information about it
 kya sarkaar is yojana ko or behatar tareeke se lagu karne kaa intazaam karegi yaa phir aane vaale saalon main bhi log dhundte hi phirenge ki sasti dawa kahaan he? It is noteworthy that first a BSF jawan, then CRPF and then army jawan alleged that the jawans are supplied with substandard food
 yahi nahin sena main jari sahaayak system par bhi sawaal uthaae gaye or aarope lagaaya gaya ki javaanon se boot polish se lekar kapade tak dhulawaaye jate hai
 According to the Ministry of Defense, the matter has been taken very seriously
 desh bhar main hajaaron unit hai or har str par monitor karnaa mushkil he, isliye ek tantra banane kii jarurat he
 Ministry has started work in this direction
 raksha mantralay ke mutabik, is maamle ko kaaphi gambhirtha se liya gaya he
 There are thousands of units across the country and it is difficult to monitor at every level, so a mechanism needs to be created

 Dilip Pandey accused BJP of cheating DBC employees
 pandey ne kaha ki dibisi varkar saal ke 12 maheene kaam karte hai or khud machharon se ladakar dilli waalon or machharon ke bich ek dhaal banakar kaam karte hue unhen machharon se bachaate hai
 In this case, they should be confirmed

 What are the main demands According to Budharam, president of the Anti Malaria Integration Employees Union, there are 7 important demands of the union, of which the most important demand is to ensure DBC workers
 iske alaava dibisi varkar chaahate hai ki unhen bhi salanaa chhuttiyaan, pief vagairah diya jaae
 Compensation should be given for death or accident on duty and the proposal for 4 months service break in North MCD should be canceled

 Amid the growing problem of call drop, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has proposed stringent provision for this
 tri ne kaha he ki kol drop or sevaaon kii kharaab quality ke liye doorsanchaar operataron ko upabhoktaaon ko muaavja dena chahie

 paricharchaa patr main kaha gaya he, aisa lagata he ki kol drop ke khilaaf upabhoktaaon ko raahat ke upaay tabhi prabhavi honge, jabaki ye upabhoktaaon tak pahunchen
 These measures include not charging the consumers for the interruption of calls, or adding talk time or amounts to their accounts
 niamak kaa prastaav he ki koi bhi kol jo paanch second main cat jaati he, us par shulk nahin laganaa chahie
 If the call cuts at any time after five seconds, the last pulse of the call should not be included to charge
 ullekhneey he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne haal main kol drop kii samasya par chintaa jataai thi
 The comments tri ke chairman ares sharma ne kaha, upabhokta kol drop samasya kaa saamana kar rahe hai

 The regulator proposes that any call which is cut in five seconds should not be charged

 It is noteworthy that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had recently expressed concern over the problem of call drop

 Krishna Gopal, while discussing the book 'dalit Discourse', disagreed on the use of the word Dalit
 unhone kaha ki sanvdhaan sabha ne bhi dalit shabd kii jagah anusuchit jati shabd sweekaar kiya tha
 This was the trick of the British, which was called a Dalit and a conspiracy to divide Hindu society
 dow
 Krishna Gopal said that there is no doubt that atrocities with that society (scheduled) took place in the country for a long time
 darasal, ateet main jab bharat par bahriyon ne hamale kiye tab desh kaa dakshinyan shuru hua
 At the time of the invasion of Islam, the phase of self-defense of Hindu society began to shrink
 darasal yah ek aisa akraman tha jiske peeche sirf jeet kii ichha nahin balki dharmantaran bhi tha
 During the shrinking of the society, the biggest problem comes from sociality

 Whereas in the past the people of the scheduled society, the Shudras had a special place in the society
 anek dharmagranthon kii rachana karne vaale shudra rahe
 The Sangh leader said that leave aside old things, in the year 1980-81, the incident of ill-treatment with the Scheduled Classes came to light
 jab minakshipuram gaanv(tamilnadu) main bhadbhaav ke chalate kai dalit pariwaron ke dharmantaran kar lene kaa maamla saamne aayaa tha
 It was learned that some people were humiliated after the wife of a scheduled class doctor touched a matka placed on a public tap
 apane khilaaf is bhedbhaav se dalit samudaay kii bhavanaaen aahat huin
 They felt that this is a society that does not respect us
 baad main sangh netaaon ne daura kar vahaan anusuchit varg se ho rahe bhedbhaav ko khatm karaayaa gaya
 Then he converted to Hinduism again

 Ambedkar arrived to perform this satyagraha
 lambii duuri tay kar ambedkar ke saath pahuche logon ne jab bhojan banaaya to sthaneey logon ne unke bhojan main mitti daal diya
 Ambedkar's colleagues were very angry at this
 tab ambedkar ne samajhaate hue kaha tha ki bair se bair khatm nahin hota
 Later, after satyagraha, he returned to Ambedkar hungry and thirsty
 krishna gopal ne kaha ki bahut samay tak anusuchit jati ke logon ne ksht paaya he
 They also have anger in it, which is justified
 magar is bhedbhaav ko dur karne ke prayaas bhi hote rahe hai
 In the past, all the great men from Jyotiba Phule, Dayanand have been coming forward for this

 ’‘ghabaraane kii koi baat nahin he bhabhi-sab thik he
 '- Then where did they leave?' Look - listen calmly, when we were walking from the park, Manoharji felt dizzy
 ’‘phir, gir gayi kya? zyada chot to nahin aayi?’ meraa to kalejaa munh ko aa gaya tha
 'how fall? We were all together
 phir hamane sochaa, paas main to sarthak nursing home he
 By the way b
 pi
 They check, etc
 ’‘phir?‘‘phir kuch nahin
 Duty Doctor b
 pi
 Checked
 thik tha
 Then he said - Big Doctor will come at eleven o'clock
 ek baar unhen dikhaa lete hai
 That's why we left them there
 gupta paas main baitha he
 ''brother! Please take me meraa ji bahut ghabara rahaa he
 "I came only to pick you up
" auto khadaa kiya hua he
 Just thinking you would put something in the mouth- Well, let's go
 ’maine fatafat ghar band kiya or unke saath chal padi
 On the way, we left Mrs
 Mathur at her home and headed straight to the nursing home
 mere man main itani buree-buree kalpanaaen aa rahi thim
 But when i reached and saw that he and Gupta were sitting happily in the room and molesting me, i came to know my life
 ‘doctor aa gayi?’ maathur ne poocha
 'taking rounds
 uske baad dekhenge
 'after some time, i got a call
 ye doston ke saath chale gayi
 i sat in the room
 acha hua jo in logon ne cameraa le liya tha nahin to baahar baraamde main baithna padataa
 After half an hour all three returned
 report acchhee thi
 Meaning, nothing seems to be happening right now
 ho saktaa he kaaphi der tak dhoop main baithne ke kaaran hua ho yaa uthte samay koi nas khinch gayi ho
 But the doctor said - Once you see a neurologist
 shaam kii appointment bhi le lee thi
 Nursing homes are associate specialists
 ve shaam ko aayenge
 'I told them both -' You people go home now
 main inke paas hum
 'before leaving, they both ordered tea-biscuits for us
 dopaher ko mistar or misses kapur khaanaa lekar aa gayi
 In the evening, the Kapoor couple brought tea and sandwiches
 jab unhen pataa chalaa doctor aane vaale hai to ve ruke rahe
 'these doctor sir too
 ke
 Gave a report and said- If this happens again, please contact immediately
 apan emarai kar lenge
 The advice of the nursing home doctor was - stop tonight
 subah tasalli ke saath ghar jaaie
 'all are trades to make money' - they cry
 maine kaha- ‘ve to hamen bulaane nahin aaye the
 We came running to him
 to ab unki tasalli tak ruk jaaie
 He may have given this advice for some reason
 ’saat baje maathur sahab aaye
 He said - 'I thought i would get the discharge, so i stayed for Nitin
 gaadi lekar aayaa hum
 '-then do this, Nitin, you leave the aunt home and tell Gupta - stop here at night, if they come, i will come by auto
 ‘main ruk jaati hum
 ' -I said
 ‘nahin bhabhi ji- ye aapke bas kii baat nahin
 If needed at night, someone should run
 main hi ruk jaataa par in dinon meri tabiyat bhi jaraa dhili chal rahi he
 i am of no use in Emergency
 ’nitin ne mujhe ghar choda
 Taking the key from me opened the gate, then opened the main door
 phir mere haath main ek tiffin thama kar bolaa- ‘mummy ne aapke liye khaanaa bheja he
 Uncle's abstention was not known
 ’‘koi baat nahin betaa, ab tum ghar jaao
 You have come straight back after returning from office
 pataa nahin chaay bhi pi he ki nahin? banaaun
 He went after drinking tea
 aap takalif na karen
 You do not have our number
 jarurat ho to kol kar lijiyegaa
 Shall i go? 'after that, i sat numb for how long
 inaki tabiyat kaa kuch samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha
 They were telling everything is fine - then they were stopping for the whole night
 pataa nahin kya hua he
 Did not have the slightest desire to eat
 thodaa-sa munh juthar kar maine khaanaa frij main daal diya
 Tried to watch TV
 man nahin laga
 Didn't even want to read anything
 to nau baje hi get main taala daalkar maine battiyaan buja deen
 Lost in my thoughts, i was changing the sides that the gate bell suddenly rang
 itani raat gayi koun hoga? maine turant baahar kii batti jalaayee or khidki se jhankkar dekha- ‘bhabhiji, get kholie
 'gupta ji had a voice
 meraa dil buree tarah dhadak uthaa
 What is Mr
 Gupta doing here right now
 unhen to nursing home main hona tha
 Is it that they have got the discharge? badahavaas-si girte-padate main baahar pahunchi
 Opening the gate, i said- 'guptaji, you on such a night? Everything is fine, is it not? ’‘itani raat kahaan bhabhi
 It is already half past nine
 ’- unhone bheetar aate hue kaha
 Now i see that he is accompanied by his grandson
 mujhe pranaam karke balak ek ore khadaa ho gaya
 'you were going to the nursing home
 ’‘janevaala tha par rahul ne manaa kar diya
 If there is an emergency, then first your hands and feet will swell
 isse acha he main chalaa jaataa hum
 Just relive me early in the morning - then he went on night duty
 aapke liye main shaunak ko le aayaa hum
 He further said to the grandson - 'this is the whole Kumbhakarna
 par koi saath rahegaa to aapako hausala bana rahegaa
 'really, the mere fantasy of being with someone gave me great relief
 ‘acha bete, main chalata hum
 He patted the son and said- 'don't bother the grandmother and live smartly
 ’unke jane ke baad maine get main taala daalaa or bheetar aa gayi
 Closing the door of the hall, i said to Shaunak- 'stay for two minutes, son, i should change the bed room sheet of the guest room
 ’‘nahin daadi-main yaheen dewan par so rahoonga
 Just give something to wear
 ’maine dewan par uskaa bistar lagaate hue kaha- ‘betaa, yahaan bhi tivi he
 If you want to see something, see it
 ’‘nahin daadi- main thodaa padhuunga
 Exams are going on! 'I felt so hesitant-' Because of me, your studies were killed
 ’‘vaise bhi raat main main kitna pard letaa
 I'll just look a little or aap get kii chaabi mujhe de jaaie
 I'll leave quietly in the morning
 ’‘vaah! aise kaise nikal jaaoge
 Drink tea
 bas mujhe ek baar aawaaj de lenaa
 'I went to sleep keeping a glass of milk and a bottle of water for him
 par der raat tak neend nahin aayi
 The whole day's events kept revolving in front of the eyes
 pataa nahin kab aankh lagi
 In the morning, sunlight had spread in the room
 hadabadaakar uthi- dekha, guptaji kaa pota chalaa gaya tha
 The key to the gate lock was placed on the table
 kambal or chadar tahaakar rakkhe hue the
 Inside, milk bags were stacked on the dining table
 mujhe us par bada pyaar aa gaya
 What a humble child
 chaay pikar main fatafat naha lee
 If you get a phone call from the hospital, someone is needed to receive it
 kareeb saadhe das baje maathur sahab kaa phone aayaa- ‘bhabhi! doctor kaa round ho jane ke baad ham log aa jaayenge
 You can have breakfast
 bhai sahab ko yahaan kara diya he- ve kuch kah rahe hai, sun lijie
 "listen-" he said- "put my bed outside on the dewan itself
" ’itnaa taav aayaa, beemaari main bhi darbar laga kar baithenge
 But then throughout the day there was such a fair in the house that they thought it was right to say
 bedroom main kis-kis ko le aate, kahaan bithaati
 These people returned home at half past one
 maathur sahab ne maafee maangate hue kaha- ‘sori bhabhiji- aapako bahut intjaar karaayaa
 Actually we were looking forward to Nitin
 vah lunch aavar main hi aa paaya
 'wanted to say that i would have taken a taxi
 par aisa kahkar unke sadashyata kaa apmaan karne kii ichha nahin hui
 As soon as they arrived, the house became very buzzing for two days
 raat tak aanewaalon kaa tantaa laga rahaa
 Those who could not reach the nursing home came home apologizing
 mujhe dinabhar saans lene kii fursat nahin mili
 After 9 o'clock in the night, this surge came to an end and i hurried up
 khaane par baithte hi inhone bura-sa munh bana liya
 'i'm not so sick bro
 kal se dalia or khichdi khilaa-khilaa kar tum logon ne sachmuch mujhe biimaar kar diya he
 "sorry" i said apologizing- "but this khichdi is not in the context of your illness
 darasal mujhe kuch banane kaa samay hi nahin mila
 Seeing what kind of hysteria was there throughout the day
 ’‘isiilie to kahata hum ek cook rakh lo
 But you have only one rut - there is so much food for two people
 ’ham donon ke bich yah shaashvat vaad tha
 So i did not answer and kept eating quietly
 meri ankhen jhapakane lagi thim
 There was no opportunity to straighten the waist at all throughout the day
 ham log sone ja rahe the ki phone kii ghanti baji
 He lifted the cordless Rakha near the bed - he turned on the speaker as soon as the sound came from there
 samaj gayi ki soham hoga
 If we have a children's phone, then we turn on the speaker
 ‘papa aap ghar par hai? discharge mil gaya?’‘haa betaa- dopaher main hi ghar aa gaya tha
 "what the doctor says
" ’kah rahe the- chintaa kii koi baat nahin he
 If this happens again, we will investigate
 ‘bill kitna hua? vaise jitna bhi hua ho- main paise bhej rahaa hum
 Will check in your account
 ’‘bill kaa pataa nahin betaa
 Mathur did it only
 main puch-puch kar haar gaya par usne bataaya nahin
 Mathur, Gupta, Kapoor, Sharan, these people helped a lot
 hamen mahasoos hi nahin hone diya ki ham log yahaan akele hai
 Son, will you do one thing? ’‘main in sab ke nambar bhej detaa hum
 Call you all one thank you
 ’‘vah bahut od nahin lagegaa? isse to acha he main kuch thankyuu cards bhej detaa hum
 Will give it to all of you
 ’‘yah kuch zyada hi aupchaarik nahin lagegaa?’‘to papa aisa karte hai- main agali baar aauungaa to sabake liye gifts lekar aauungaa- or khud sabake ghar jaakar de aauungaa
 Okay? "yes," he said reluctantly
 shakl se saaf jaahir tha ki unhen yah prastaav pasand nahin aayaa he
 As soon as he kept the phone, he said- "who told Soham?" "who else will i do
 ’‘manaa kiya tha na!’‘aapke manaa karne se kya hota he
 Just think about me too
 chintaa ke maare praan nikle ja rahe the
 She could share only with children
 ’‘to sonia ko bhi phone kiya hoga
 Do you know how hyper it is
 ro-ro kar ghar bhar diya hoga usne
 Sanjeev Poor must have been upset
 ’‘use phone nahin karti to vah mere praan le leti ki utani dur bhaiya ko you
 s
 e
 i had news and could not call me in Hyderabad
 ’‘praan to ab bhi le legi ki papa ko ghar aaye aath ghante ho gayi hai or tumne mujhe khabar bhi nahin kii?’‘mere paas samay bhi tha? or sonia ko phone karne kaa matlab he aadha ghanta resiver se chipke rahanaa
 Now i will call her as soon as i wake up in the morning
 kah duungi-papa raat aath baje ghar aaye the
 "even four steps will not be able to tell your lies - see
 ’maine soch liya tha, subah uthte hi sonia ko phone kar duungi
 But where can this happen? subah-subah itane saare kaam munh baaye saamne khadey ho jate hai ki or kuch yaad hi nahin rahata
 Finally at nine o'clock his phone rang - 'mummy! Father, how are you? ”well, have gone for a bath
 ’‘matlab ghar aa gayi hai
 And you didn't even tell me
 ’‘kab bataati
 Have arrived at seven in the evening and sat in the court
 meraa to ek pair kichan main, ek drawing room main-aisi avasthaa thi
 "so it was necessary to take care of everyone
" mummy! aise main koi aapse swaagat satkar kii apeksha nahin karata
 "son, a cup of tea can be given to the guest coming home 
" tumhen pataa nahin he in logon ne kitni madad kii he
 How much support inke paas raat din koi na koi baitha rahaa
 Gupta's son slept in the hospital at night
 unka pota mere liye pariksha ke baavjood yahaan rukaa
 Everyone continued to have tea snacks from here
 or kal inhen laane ke liye maathur sahab kaa nitin lunch ower main gaadi lekar aayaa tha
 "you were saying, father came home in the evening
 ’ye thik hi kah rahe the
 My lie could not work even four steps
 usee samay mujhe agarbatti kii sugandh aayi
 They had taken bath and were lighting incense sticks in front of Sai Baba
 maine aawaaj dekar kaha- aapaki ladli kaa phone he- baat kar lijiye
 Holding the phone, i breathed a sigh of relief
 ab vah papa ke saath shuru ho gayi thi- ‘papa aap log itane abhibhoot kyon ho rahe hai? adosi-padosi to madad karte hi hai
 You too have been running for everyone
 kapur ankal kii mataji sidhiyon se gir gayi thim to aap hi unhen aspataal le gayi the
 You have got Gupta Uncle Rahul's job in a way
 aap kii hi sifarish kaam aayi thi
 And Mathur runs his car for eight days at Uncle's Pinky's wedding
 lautne par use sidhe gairaaj main hi bhejnaa padaa tha
 'how long they kept quiet after keeping the phone
 phir naashtaa karte hue bole- ‘apane bachche kitne practical ho gayi hai
 "not practical, say insensitive
" ’‘main sochataa hum kya rahul or nitin ne bhi apane maa-baap se aisi hi hujjt kii hogi?’‘ab phaltu baaten sochakar apana dimag mat kharaab kiijie
 Just remember how much those children have done
 ’‘vahi to
 i am unable to understand how i will repay the favor of these people
 ’‘ab uski tension lekar biimaar mat pad janaa
 Let me say one thing - when we think of taking revenge on someone's favors, we indirectly wish for them some misfortune - so that we have an opportunity to help them
 ’inaki ankhen ekadam chamak uthin- ‘are vaah! tumne to yah badi acchhee baat kah di
 "that's not my thing
" sadiyon pehle, valmiki ji ne kah rakkhi he
 After finding the whereabouts of Sita ji, Shri Ram Prabhu said to Hanumanji - 'watts you have done a great favor on me
 main tumhaara rini ho gaya hum
 Because it means wishing for your evil
 ’ gosai ji bhi kehete hai- sunu sut tohe urin main naahi
 'so-relax Barr - after repeatedly declaring Mathur Sahib showed the bill
 pantis hajaar kaa tha
 'thirty five thousand in one night?' i got out of my mouth
 ve bole- ‘kamare kaa kiraaya, nursing chargees, do teen test karaaye the unki fees, davaaiyaan, kamare main ek baar jhaank jane kii doctoron kii fees- or sabase jaanaleva fees un specialist mahoday kii thi
 "come on, they come home well - there is no cost for this
" ’do teen din baad ye bole- ‘chalo jaraa maathur ke yahaan ho aate hai
 "why?" "don't owe him money?" "I thought you might have given the check the same day
" '‘de saktaa tha par nahin diya
 That would have been a formality
 ghar jaakar denge to dhanyavad gyaapan hoga
 'I liked what he said
 ham donon ko dekhakar maathur sahab bahut khush hue
 He also called the Gupta people by calling
 khub gapshap hui
 Tea and breakfast were served
 inase vaada liya gaya ki kal se morning walk phir se shuru karenge
 After standing for an hour and a half, they stood up
 bade adab ke saath inhone maathur sahab ko check thamaya
 'what was the fraternity so soon! For a few days, i remain indebted - it would be fun
 ’‘sirf paise hi to lautaa rahaa hum bhaiya
 Everything else cannot be returned and i do not even want to return it
 aap sab kaa yah karj mujh par hameshaa bana rahe-yahi kaamana he
 Saying all this, his face looked absolutely happy and stress free

 India vs Australia
 bitate vakt ke saath cricket ke maidan par in donon deshon ne is khel ko nae aayam die hai
 The border-gavaskar Trophy began in 1996, when it was decided that these two countries would regularly confront each other
 har siries ke saath ek nayaa hero saamne aayaa
 The story was written to become the champion
 haar or jeet ke myne badalane lage
 Gradually cricket is no longer just a game
 isi kadi main 2003 ke edilade test main rahul dravid (233 or naabad 72 ran) dwaara kheli gai wo aitihaasik pari bhi aati he jo aaj bhi har cricket prashansak ke jehan main he
 Virat Kohli has a special relationship with Adelaide! Rahul Dravid was a troubleshooter for India in his career
 england kii pichon par dravid kaa record shuruyaat se sabase behtareen rahaa, par south africa or australia main unka pradarshan kuch khaas nahin rahaa tha
 When he first went to Australia in 1999–2000, he struggled to score one run
 test kii chah pariyon main sirf 95 ran
 But in 2004 everything changed
 saurav ganguli kii 144 ran ke boote bharat bristben test drow karaane main kaamyaab rahaa
 The next match was to be played in Adelaide
 vaise kangaroo team bhi glen mcgra or shen warn ke bina thodi kamjor thi
 The bowling task was on the young shoulders of Brad Williams, Nathan Bracken and Stuart mcgill
 bharat ke liye itihaas rachane kaa yah sunaharaa mauka tha, jise usne bhunaaya bhi
 India did not have a good start in the Adelaide Test
 pehla test drow hone se baukhalaaye kangaaroon ne joardaar palatwaar kiya
 Batting first, scored 556 runs
 star rahe riki ponting, jinhone 242 ran banaae
 In response, India started well
 66 / 0 ke score se 85 / 4, achaanak bhartiya pari ladkadaa gai
 All top order batsmen, except Dravid, had returned to the pavilion
 unka saath dene vivies lakshmana krij par aae
 The Australian team must have had memories of the 2001 Kolkata Test at the moment, but they never thought that it could happen again
 par aisa hua
 The only difference was that Dravid was going to play the role of senior partner in place of Laxman
 is jodi ne pehali pari ko sambhala
 By the end of the second day's play, India's score was 4 wickets for 180 runs
 tisare din kaa khel puri tarah se bharat ke paksh main rahaa
 By the time India got their fifth blow as Laxman (148), the pair had shared 303 runs
 bharat dhire-dhire majbootee kii ore badhane laga tha
 The lower-order batsmen also did not disappoint
 vahiin duusari taraf dravid aakhir tak krij par date rahe
 After playing a marathon innings of 233 runs, by the time he was dismissed as the tenth wicket, India had scored 523 runs, which is just 33 less than the score of the hosts
 rahul dravid ne is pari main kul 446 gendon kaa saamana kiya
 He scored 233 runs with the help of 23 fours and a six
 yah karnama karne ke liye unhone lagbhag 10 ghante krij par bitaye
 Hardly any Indian batting has played in foreign ground
 rahul dravid kii pari kaa video dekhen
 
 
 When the Indian innings was over, many felt that it would be difficult to decide the match on this pitch
 par kangaaroon kii duusari pari main ajit agarkar ne kamaal hi kar diya
 6 wickets for 41 runs, the hosts were piled on for just 196 runs in front of this deadly bowling
 ab bharat ko aitihaasik jeet ke liye 230 ran chahie the
 Ganguly's team was in no mood to let go of this golden opportunity
 duusari pari main dravid ko chhodkar bhale hi kisi or ballebaaj ne acchhee shuruyaat ko bade score main tabdeel nahin kiya, par vah dhire-dhire apni team ko lakshya ke kareeb le gaye
 Dravid was playing another role in this innings
 vah ek chor par date rahe
 At the same time, the responsibility of the attack was on the batsman at the other end
 chaahe vah sahvaag kii 47 ran kii pari ho yaa phir sachin ke saath 70 ran kii saajhedaari
 Dravid kept scoring runs in his familiar style
 tendulkar or ganguli kaa wicket jald kho dene ke baad ek baar phir team india dabaav main thi
 But Dravid knew the goal, he gave up the attack on Laxman
 lakshmana to maano pehle se hi tay karke aae the ki australian gendbaajon kaa aaj bakhshana nahin he
 But he was dismissed only 9 runs away from victory
 lekin dravid apana kaam karte rahe
 He wanted to return only after creating history
 hua bhi aisa hi
 The 22-year wait for victory came to an end as Dravid hit a match-winning four off Stuart mcgill towards extra cover
 ek haath main balla or duusare main cap liye jashn manaate hue rahul dravid
 This scene is still in the mind of every Indian
 1983 world cap kii jeet hamen cricket ke kareeb lekar ai, australia ke khilaaf 2001 kii test siries main jeet ne hamen khud par bharosa karnaa sikhaaya to edilade kii is jeet hamaare andar vishwaas jagaaya ki ham kisi bhi maidan yaa phir paristhiti main apane virodhiyon ko dhul chataa sakate hai
 The entire credit for this goes to Rahul Dravid

 Raj Thackeray's party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has demanded withdrawal of Padma Shri and all National Awards from actor Om Puri
 party kaa kahana he ki pakistani kalakaaron ke samarthan or bhartiya sena ke khilaaf vivaadit tippanee karne kii vajah se om puri se ye sammaan waapas liye jane chahie

 "so far we only knew Salman Khan, Mahesh Bhatt and Abu Azmi for absurd statements but now it seems that Om Puri has replaced him," said Amay Khopkar, president of mns's Film Cell
 khopakar ne kaha ki ham unhen hameshaasamvedansheel ectorke taur par jaanate the, lekin unhone apane bayanon se khud ko asamvedansheel sabit kar diya he
 All such honors like Padma Shri and National Award should be withdrawn from such a person
 bataa den ki uri aatanki hamale ke baad emenes ne bollywood main kaam karne vaale sabhi kalakaaron ko 48 ghante main mumbai chhodkar chale jane kaa ultimatum diya tha
 Since then there has been debate whether Pakistani artists should be allowed to work in Bollywood or not
