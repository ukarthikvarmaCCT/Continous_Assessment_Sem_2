 In this case, the quota should be fixed within the quota, because the remaining 70 percent of the OBC castes are still deprived of the benefits of reservation

 India's e-learning sector has become the second largest market in the world after the US and has increased to 101 in the 2019 financial year
 1 arab dollar par pahunch jane kii ummid he
 As the job market and industry needs evolve, education and technology will have to work together to teach digital skills and prepare graduates for the jobs of tomorrow
 ibm main bharat or dakshin asia kii korporate soshal responsibility head rumi malik mitra bataa rahi hai ki smart shiksha kyon bharat kaa bhavishya he
 Why online learning is becoming popular? The market is changing and it is moving towards technology based jobs
 in naukariyon ke liye data analytics, artificial intelligence or cloud computing main maharath hona jaruri he
 The answer lies in the combination of technical and life skills (or transferable skills) — employees need critical thinking skills
 kaam karne waalon kii fouj ko bazaar ke is badlaav ke hisaab se dhalanaa hoga
 Since learning is a continuous process, a more progressive approach to education and focusing on trained and skilled people will make the way easier
 technology or shiksha ko ek saath laane vaala mukhya kaarak yah he ki seekhney waalon kii ummiden badal gai hai
 They are no longer passive learners, but are full of self-confidence and motivation and want a binding, authentic and experience-giving process
 i-larning plateform ke mukhya phaayde kya hai?kai saare larning plateform maujuud hai or chaatr tathaa yuva peshewar customij content yani unke hisaab se taiyaar saamagree kii online talash karne se jhijakte nahin
 Traditional learning platforms were not able to meet the needs of the market and it became extremely important to train teachers
 i-larning main jor keval pathyapustakon se seekhney par nahin balki iske bajaae asal jindagi ke taur-tareekon se seekhney par he, jisase yah chaatro ko apane hunar main nikhaar laane or unhen ooncha uthaane ke maukey detii he
 For example, IBM has partnered with educational institutions and schools to set up Atal Tinkering Laboratories under the Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) in which we guide teachers and students and help them innovate
 artificial intelligence kii madad se aaj chaatro ke liye unki dilchaspiyon or jaruraton ke hisaab se nijee tareeke kaa content taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he
 ai-based learning can monitor progress, it can be tailored to individual students and it gives a sharp eye to the teacher
 industry ko aise logon kii darkaar he jo digital dakshata se las hon, samasyaayein hal kar sakate hon, li se hatakar soch sakate hon or dizin ko lekar sochane main sakasham hon
 How do you overcome the fear of technology from the minds of learners? To make sure students get involved with online learning modules, we have to free things from their secrets and make them easier
 ise vaaki jaldi shuru karne kii jarurat hoti he, skool str par, taaki kam umr main hi bachche i-larning ke madhyamon se acchhee tarah waakif ho saken
 Instead of running away from technology, they should connect with it and understand its benefits
 agar chaatro ko yah sikhaaya ja sake ki artificial intelligence kis tarah kisaan ke rosemara ke kaamon main uski madad kar sakati he, to ve online seekhney ke liye kahin zyada taiyaar honge
 The students are no longer passive learners but are full of self-confidence and motivation and want a binding, authentic and experiential process

 On 14 April, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was launching the Bharat Uday Abhiyan campaign from Village Uday in Madhya Pradesh, his government was preparing an answer to the Supreme Court on drought, which it had to file after the court rebuke
 april ke tisare hafte main jab sarkaar ne adaalat ko bataaya ki desh kii ek-chauthai aabaadi sookhe kii chapet main he, us dauraan party apane mantriyon or saansadon ko gaanvon main kisaan meley lagane kaa kaarykram saunp rahi thi
 As a result, amidst water scarcity, agricultural misery and drought, the village Udaya Janata, the BJP mps have not even embraced, who are often hearing shrugs and advice from the Prime Minister for not promoting full publicity of government schemes
 karishmai netritv kii aguai main prachand bahumat vaali kisi sarkaar ke saansadon kaa do saal main hi itnaa hatotsahit hona achraj main daalata he
 Especially the mps of a party which has returned to power after a long time and whose government is coming up with a new mission or scheme almost every month
 sarkaar ke abhiyaanon or skiimon par uske apane saansadon kaa thanda rukh ek sach bataa rahaa he, sarkaar jise samajhane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Not only Gramoday, despite the good intentions, in the last two years, many campaigns and missions of the government have become samples of deep inconsistency from the ground reality
 yahi vajah he ki aise badlaav nahin najar aae, jinhen lekar saansad apekshaaon se bhari janata se nazren mila saken
 The Modi government has tried to keep a finger on many painful veins of governance and socio-economic sectors but most of the experiments could not take root
 kuch mishan kaayade se shuru bhi nahin ho paae to kuch skiimon ko chalaane laayak vyavastha taiyaar nahin thi, isliye do saal ke bheetar hi modi sarkaar ke lagbhag sabhi pramukh mishan or scimen ek jaruri punargathan kii ter lagane lagi hai
 Take, for example, Make in India, which was cut off from economic reality, where it stayed
 koi shaq nahin ki menuphaccharing main nivesh jaruri he lekin modi sarkaar jab satta main ai, tab audyogic kshetra aisi mandi kii giraft main tha, jisamen companiyon ke paas baari utpaadan kshamtaayen taiyaar padi hai lekin maang nahin he
 What will be the investment when debt-ridden companies become the trouble of banks? do saal main jo videshi nivesh aayaa, vah sarvice sector main chalaa gaya jis par sarkaar kaa focus nahin tha, jabaki menuphaccharing ikaiyaan band ho rahi hai yaa utpaadan gata rahi hai
 The campaign to make business easier was part of Make in India, which did not take off, as the states did not show much enthusiasm
 mek in india ko agar praasangik rakhana he to ise chuninda udyogon par focus karnaa hoga, tabhi kuch nattejey mil sakenge
 The cleanliness mission was cut off from the reality of the existing urban management, so this road did not go beyond the very clean images
 ise puure desh main ek saath shuru karne kii galati kii gai, jo na keval asambhav tha, balki avyaavhaarik bhi
 In India, urban sanitation is the responsibility of local bodies, which lack adequate resources, labor and technology
 skim ke dizin, lakshyon or ranneeti main nagar prashasano kii bhoomika nahin thi, isliye mishan majaak banakar guzar gaya
 We hear that the cleanliness mission is going to be restructured
 ise ab chuninda shaharon par focus kiya jayega
 Better late than never
 sab kuch mobile or internet par dene kii muhim lekar shuru hua digital india is hakeekat se koi vaasta nahin rakhata tha ki jab shaharon main hi mobile network kaam nahin karte to gaanvon kaa kya haal hoga, jahaan internet to kya, wais network bhi thik se nahin chalata
 The penetration of smart phones in villages is limited and the cost of mobile internet is an essential aspect
 yahi vajah he ki digital india sarkari sevaaon ke kuch mobile aplicationon tak simit rah gaya, jabaki mobile network par kol drop badhate chale gaye
 50 percent accounts in Jan Dhan still have zero balance, in which neither the people kept the money nor the government did any transfer
 diarect benifit transfar rasoi gas kii sabsidi baantne tak thik chali kyonki usamen labhaarthiyon kii pahchaan kaa tanta nahin tha, lekin jaise hi labhaarthi pahchaan kar kerosine baantne kii baari ai, skim thithak gai
 The goals of the MP Adarsh gram Yojana were not only clear, but the mps also did not look very enthusiastic
 pension or beemaa yojanaayen pichley prayogon kii tarah kamjor dizin or simit laabhon ke chalate paravaan nahin chadhin
 Missions such as housing and smart cities for all have fallen victim to the implementation strategy, while Mudra Bank has the responsibility of the banks when they are stuck in debt
 satta main do saal puure kar rahe pradhanmantri ko yah ehsaas jarur hona chahie ki unki sarkaar ne do saal main skiimon or mishnon kaa itnaa bada parivaar khadaa kar diya he, jinaki monitering hi mushkil he, nattejey nikaal paanaa to dur kii baat he
 For quick results, the Modi government will have to reorganize the announced schemes and missions in mission mode so that the list of preferences can be decided afresh
 gaanv se lekar shahar tak, baking se lekar kooday-kachare tak or digital se lekar skill tak faile apane do darjan se adhik mishan-skim samooh main se chuninda chaar yaa paanch kaaryakramon par focus karnaa hoga
 The BJP mps are not furious about the government schemes
 ve siyasat kii jameen ke sabase kareeb hai or nateezon kii namaujuudagi main mohabhang kii tapish mahasoos kar rahe hai
 mps know that the next three years will be full of electoral politics, in which the scope for doing something big will be reduced
 isliye jo ho chukaa he, use chust-durust kar agar nattejey nikaale ja saken to party saansadon kaa utsaah lautne kii surat ban sakati he
 During the debate in the Rajya Sabha on mob lynching, the statement of SP MP Naresh Aggarwal became furious
 agarwal ke bayaan par bijepi saansad sadan main bhadak uthe or unase maafee kii maang kii
 On the statement of SP MP, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anant Kumar said that Naresh Aggarwal's statement is an insult to Hinduism, he should apologize
 bijepi saansadon ke virodh ke baad naresh agarwal kaa bayaan rajyasabha kii kaarywahi se hataa diya gaya he
 Naresh Aggarwal also regretted his statement
 buudhvaar ko rajyasabha main mob linching ke mudde par rajyasabha main bahes shuru hui
 Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad started the debate
 is dauraan unhone junayd kaa mudda uthaaya, vahiin dalit bujurg ko mandir main naa jane ke mudde ko bhi gulam nabi aaazaad ne uthaaya

 aaazaad bole ki vahaan par nai-nai sarkaar bani thi, us dauraan police ne vahaan par do logon ko goli maar di thi, jisamen se ek kii maukey par hi maut ho gai thi
 But SHO was suspended for a week and nothing else
 mohammad ayub pandit kii hatya ek sharmnaak baat he, ham isaki ninda karte hai
 In Maharashtra too, a man wearing a Muslim cap was killed
 unhone kaha ki aaj desh main jitani bhi linching ho rahi he ki usamen ruling party ke sangh parivaar kaa koi naa koi sadsy rahaa he
 We believe that the PM has given a statement on this, but the government may have kept thinking that we will keep making statements, but you keep doing your work
 desh sabakaa he lekin sabase zyada jimmedaari sarkari kii banati he
 The government itself is spoiling the atmosphere of the country
 gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki ye ladaai kisi dharm kii nahin he, ye hindu-muslim kii ladaai he
 This is a fight for humanity
 unhone kaha ki ham musalmaan hone ke baavjood kashmir main ladate hai, kashmir main do muslim partiyaan hi aamane-saamne hai
 The country should not be broken on the basis of vote
 nakvi ne diya javabasarkaar kii ore se mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha ki ye jo bhi ghatnaayen ho rahi hai ye aparaadh he ise sampradayik rang nahin dena chahie
 He said that the government has taken stern action after every incident
 nakvi ne kaha ki har mudde par bharat ekajute he
 In an all-party meeting, PM Modi spoke on the issue of cow protection, he said that some people are spoiling the atmosphere of the country by taking advantage of it

 Even before the assembly elections in Chhattisgarh, a fierce battle has started in the Congress over the candidature of the Chief Minister
 chhattisgarh congress main mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaaron kii sankhya lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 So far, half a dozen Congress leaders have submitted their claim for the post of Chief Minister
 puri sakriyata ke saath congressi netaa mukhyamantri pad kii daavedaari kar rahe he
 Though the BJP has been in power in the state for the past 15 years, due to which the Congress has been shattered, but this time due to the feeling of anti-incumbency, the political ambitions of the Congressmen are speaking up
 iskaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki darjan bhar se zyada netaa kursi kii daud main ek-duusare ko patkhni dene main jute hue hai, jabakibijepimen raman singh hi mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa he
 He is also currently the Chief Minister of the state
 bijepi saaf kar chuki he ki chauthaa vidhansabha chunaav bhi mukhyamantri raman singh ke netritv main hi ladaa jayega
 However, factionalism and infighting within the party is on the rise due to the long queue of "CM in waiting" in the Congress
 bijepi ise apane liye shubh sanket maan rahi he
 In the Congress, these are the contenders for the post of Chief Minister, till now the leaders of the Congress who have started presenting themselves as the Chief Minister, among them, Leader of Opposition TS Singhdev, State Congress President Bhupesh Baghel, Former Union Minister Charan Das Mahant, Executive State President Ram Dayal Uike and Doctor Shiv Dahria and former leader of opposition Ravindra Choubey topped
 iske alawa adivasee, anusuchit jati va saamaanya varg ke kai or netaa bhi khud ko mukhyamantri kaa daavedaar bataa rahe hai
 The Congress high command will decide the name of the upcoming CM Seeing the growing list of leaders who have dreams of becoming the Chief Minister, the state Congress president Bhupesh Baghel has to say that the party high command will decide who will become the CM
 philhal unki praathamikta bijepi sarkaar ko satta se bedakhal karne kii he
 On the other hand, due to the attitude and behavior of the claimants of the Chief Minister, mutual infighting and competition among the leaders has started
 iskaa sidhaa asar congress ke bijepi virdohi kaaryakramon par pad rahaa he
 The factionalism is clearly visible in the sit-in demonstrations organized against the BJP government of the state
 CM pad ke liye bijepi ne chauthi baar raman singh par lagaaya daanvchhattisgarh main isi saal oktober-november maah main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 So while the BJP has bet on Raman Singh for the chief minister's post for the fourth time, the Congress has not yet made it clear who will lead the public under whose leadership
 congress netaa TS singhdev bole- bananaa chahta hum cmnewa pratipaksh ties singhdev ne ek bayaan jari kar kaha ki wo mukhyamantri bananaa chaahate hai, lekin kisi ko peeche karke nahin, balki party sahmati de tabhi ve mukhyamantri banenge
 After this, they will not only develop Surguja, but the entire Chhattisgarh
 singhdev ke is bayaan ke baad congress ke bheetar ghamaasan chhid gaya he
 Each Chhatrap is busy declaring himself as the Chief Minister
 party ke bheetar pratispardhaa itani bad gai he ki khud ko mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar bataane vaale bayaan par ties singhdev ko party ke andar or baahar safai deni pad rahi he
 The new equations within the party had TS Singhdev to say in his explanation that the party has more than 13 faces eligible to become chief minister
 bijepi ne lee chutki, kaha- khyaali pilav pakaa rahi congressudhar, pradesh congress prabharee piel puniya ne mukhyamantri kii daavedaari karne vaale tamaam netaaon par apni nigaah gada rakhi he
 Seeing the rapid infighting within the party about the Chief Minister, he is also in a dilemma
 wo apane netaaon ko samajha rahe hai ki congress main kabhi bhi siem project nahin kiya jaataa he
 At the same time, the BJP has quipped about the infighting in the Congress
 bijepipradesh adhyaksh dharam laal kowshik ne kaha he ki congress sirf khyaali pilav pakaa rahi he
 He claimed that the BJP will come to power for the fourth time too
 mukhyamantri raman singh ne bhi congress par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki is baar to congress ko uske vidhayak dhunde nahin milenge
 He claims that Chhattisgarh is now going to be Congress free
 vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko mat vibhaajan kaa khatraarajya main maujuuda raajnneetik sameekaran main bijepi or congress ke bich kadi pratispardhaa ke asaar hai, lekin purv mukhyamantri ajit jogi kii sakriyata se congress par mat vibhaajan kaa khatra mandara rahaa he
 In fact, in the last assembly election, the difference of votes between BJP and Congress has been less than one per cent
 iske chalate rajya kii kul 90 vidhansabha siton main se bijepi 49 siton par or congress 39 siton par kabja jamaane main kaamyaab rahi, jabaki ek maatr seat bispi ke khate main gai thi
 However, realizing the danger of a very small margin of vote percentage, this time the BJP does not want to leave any stone unturned to make its lead in all 90 assembly seats
 iske tamaam anuvaanshik sanghathan booth str par party kii majbootee banaae rakhane ke liye date hue hai
 In comparison, there is not much activity of other opposition parties including Congress
 philhal mukhyamantri pad ko lekar congress ke bheetar chhide ghamaasan or netaaon kii utsukata ne party kii musiibat badha di he

 rahul gandhi ne aaj ek baar phir doharaaya ki agar unhen sadan main bolne diya jaae to ve piem modi ek minute vahaan khadey nahin ho paaenge
 Today at the Talkatora Stadium in Delhi, Congress President Rahul Gandhi spoke on everything from foreign policy to the country's economy and women's safety
 unke bhaashan ke 8 pramukh mudde ye hai, jinke jariye unhone piem modi or bijepi par hamalaa kiya
 1
 beti bachaao lekin bijepi or inke vidhayakon serahul gandhi ne kaha- 8 saal kii bacchee ke saath rape hota he, unnav main rape hota he, lekin modi apane vidhayak ke liye kuch nahin bolte
 In 2014, there was talk of 2 crore jobs, 15 lakhs, Beti Bachao
 ab inkaa nayaa naaraa he "beti bachaao", lekin bijepi se bachaao, bijepi ke vidhayak se bachaao
 The youngest girl is raped, but the Prime Minister did not say anything about the BJP MLA
 aaj IMF chif ne bhi mahila suraksha ke bare main bolaa he
 2
 sanvaidhanik sansthaaon ko dabaaya ja raharahul ne kaha ki desh main jo bhi sanvaidhanik sanstha hai unhen dabaaya ja rahaa he
 Four judges of the Supreme Court came before the public to plead for justice
 lekin unki aawaaj bhi dabaa di gai
 Our Constitution has given all the institutions of the country
 iaiti, im se lekar supreme court tak
 But today people with RSS ideology are being put on all institutions
 bijepi kuch bhi kar le, ham unhen samvidhan ko haath nahin lagane denge
 3
 rafel-neerav par main bolaa to khadey nahin paaenge piemrahul ne kaha ki sarkaar ne unhen sansad main bolne se roka
 If i speak in Parliament for 15 minutes on the issue of Rafael and Nirav Modi, Narendra Modi will not be able to stand
 puraa desh jaanata he ki rafel main chori hui 
 Nirav Modi runs away with 30 thousand crores, but his friends remain silent
 pehali baar sarkaar hi sansad nahin chalane de rahi he
 Modi ji told his mps and mlas that you people spice up the media
 ab desh sirf pradhanmantri ke man kii baat sunegaa
 4
 congress hi he samadhandaliton par atyaachaar, bacchiyon ke saath rape or yuvaaon ko rojgaar kaa jhootha aashwaasan diya gaya
 Gabbar Singh tax ruined traders and farmers
 congress shiksha, swasth, rojgaar, mahilaon kii raksha kaise karegi, ye sawaal hamaare saamne he, or keval congress hi iskaa samaadhaan degi
 The Congress will run a campaign to save the Constitution, save the Dalits and the vulnerable
 main bhi shaamil hounga
 Wherever BJP oppresses Dalits, the Congress flag will be seen
 unhen hamaari takat kaa pataa lag bhi gaya he
 In 2019, we will oust him from power
 5
 How did Modi become Modi's only mean PM? Modi only has interest in Modi
 chaahe dalit mare, mahilaon ke saath atyaachaar ho, isse unhen fark nahin padataa
 There is interest in becoming a PM only
 modi ji ko sirf modi se matlab he
 6
 daliton ke saath ho rahaa atyachaarrahul ne kaha ki jo modi kii vichaardhaara he wo desh ke har vyakti ko samajni chahie
 Modi says that atrocities against Dalits are increasing, but the reality is that there is no place for Dalits in Modi's heart
 piem kii vichaardhaara daliton ke samarthan vaali nahin he
 Atrocities against Dalits are increasing, but Modi ji has remained silent
 upi, oona jaise maamle saamne aa rahe hai
 Congress raised its voice in Gujarat, then after three days Modi ji comes on stage and tears come out
 7
 Modi did the name of the country in the world
 The world used to say that different people live together in India
 kahati thi ki bharat samvidhan, supreme court, sansad kaa koi matlab hota he
 The rest of the country looked towards us, but the honor of the country in the world has been destroyed by Modi ji
 aaj duniya main mahilaon ke saath balaatkaar, alpsankhyak par akraman, daliton par atyaachaar kii baat hoti he
 In 70 years, Congress has earned the respect of the country, but in 4 years Modi has damaged it
 ise bachaana he

 haalanki jurmaane kii yah rakam bahut badi nahin he lekin aam aadmi kii rahanuma hone kaa daawa kar dilli kii kursi par baithi kejariwal sarkaar ke liye yah bada tamaacha he
 Dengue and chikungunya in the country's capital showed such havoc about 10 years ago
 vaise dilli-ensiaar main pichley kuch varshon se yah samasya aam ho chali he
 Every year, as soon as the rainy season is over, cases of dengue and chikungunya start appearing
 jaahir he dilli main raaj kar rahi kejariwal sarkaar ko bhi iskaa ilm hoga
 But there was a time last month that the number of dengue and chikungunya patients in hospitals was increasing and the entire staff including the CM of Delhi was out of the capital
 dilli main mahamari, sarkaar saiyr parasitambar ke duusare hafte main yah mahamari charam par thi to dilli kii janata kii kherakhbar lene vaala koi nahin tha
 CM Arvind Kejriwal first campaigned for the Punjab elections, then went to Bangalore to get his treatment

 Some other ministers in the Kejriwal cabinet were also out of the capital for other reasons

 The knowledge and anger of the Health Minister, the issue of epidemic in Delhi made media headlines, then the Health Minister of Delhi Government returned to Delhi after campaigning for his party
 yahaan patrakaron ne jab unase dilli ke swasthya ko lekar sawaal puche to wo vigyaan samajhane lage ki chikangunia se duniya main ek bhi maut nahin hui he
 During this, he also got angry with journalists
 gusse main to unhone ek patrkaar kaa mobile bhi phenk diya
 Four days later, Jain reiterated his point and cited Google, saying that Google also says that no patient dies from chikungunya
 haalanki, unke is 'google gyaan' kariyality chekakia gaya to swasthya mantri fail sabit hue
 a round of accusations and counter-accusations also took place during a period of epidemic in Rajdhani

 inkaa kahana tha ki alji ne pehle kejariwal sarkaar kii ore se rakhe gaye swasthya sachiv ko hataaya or apane banaae swasthya sachiv ko jaan-boojhkar chuttee par bhej diya
 Kapil Mishra, Minister in the Delhi Government, tweeted, 'LG Sahab, wherever you are, remember one thing, God will never forgive you for making such a nefarious and criminal conspiracy against the people of Delhi
 'mohalla clinics kaa kya hua?supreme court kii fatkaar ke baad swasthya mantri satendra jain ne jab apana halafanama daayar kiya to is baar bhi swasthya sachiv par sara dosha madh diya
 Jain alleged that Chandrakar Bharti never showed interest in setting up the Mohalla clinic
 itnaa hi nahin, swasthya sachiv ne chuttee par jane se pehle mujhase milanaa jaruri nahin samajha or lautne ke baad bhi kisi meeting main hissaa nahin liya
 This is the same Satyendra Jain, who announced a few days ago that Mohalla clinics will also work like fever clinics
 lekin dengue or chikangunia ke daur main jab in mohalla clinics kaa reality check kiya gaya to pataa chalaa ki ye clinics dengue or chikangunia se ladane main naakaafi sabit ho rahe hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party promised to establish one thousand Mohalla clinics in the capital before the elections in Delhi
 chunaav se pehle jhadujhadu aam aadmi party kaa chunaav chinh he
 Before the elections in Delhi, Aam Aadmi Party workers used to walk around Delhi with a broom in their hands wearing the hat bearing this election symbol
 jagah-jagah par jhaadu lagaate bhi dikh jate the
 But if these workers used to sweep the street in the days of dengue and chikungunya, then the mosquitoes of dengue and chikungunya would not have spread
 or aaj sthiti itani gambhir nahin ho paati
 But where was the Kejriwal government concerned about the people of Delhi who voted openly to the Aam Aadmi Party, thinking that if the new government is formed then the common people will no longer have to face the trouble faced by it

 But on Tuesday morning, Hrithik has written another two-page letter on Twitter saying that he will not say anything anymore

 com / iicea18nfu— Hrithik Roshan (@ihrithik)october 10, 2017is letters main unhone likhaa he, ''ye post main un media housees ke liye likh rahaa hum, jahaan se mujhe lagaataar intervyuuj ke liye request aa rahi hai
 i have given two interviews
 main un logon se maafee chaahunga jinhen main ab intervyuu nahin de sakuunga
 i do not want to talk on this issue anymore
 mujhe kaaphi dabaav kii paristhatiyon main apana paksh rakhana tha, wo main kar chukaa hum
 "this actor had already revealed the affair of ranbir-kangana! Recently, Hrithik was seen talking openly on this issue on a TV channel
" isse pehle unhone fasebuk post bhi likhi thi
 Where he put his side on this whole issue
 is letters main rithik aage likhte hai, '' media hamaare samaaj kaa ahm hissaa he or unhen pataa hona chahie ki zyada baat hone se ye mudda khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 i am not someone to advise the media, but this matter should be covered according to the facts
 isse ham main se kai logon ko chaiyn kii saans lene ko milegi
 "there was pressure on Hrithik in the Kangana case, due to this, in 766 words, he wrote his thanks to his fans for the support
" i would like to thank those who supported me
 lekin meri sabhi doston or shubhachintakon se request he ki is mudde par kisi kii bhi tarafdaari na karen
 This is not a contest
 mere ye sab kehane kaa matlab is mudde ko yaheen khatm kar dena nahin he
 All i want is something to be said only after a thorough investigation into it
 ''tivi intervyuu dete hue ancomfortable tha main''bataa den ki haal hi main die gaye tivi intervyuu main unhone kaha tha ki wo is sho main aane ke liye ancomfortable bhi the, lekin wo sabake saamne apni baat rakhana chaahate the
 He said that i have never fought with any man or woman in my life
 mere talaak ke samay bhi koi ladaai nahin hui thi
 i did not want to speak in front of anyone
 mujhe dar tha ki mere shabdon ko galat tareeke se liya jayega
 If i use the words strog, people will consider me offensive
 agar main apni bhaawanaaon ko jaahir karuunga, to log mujhe kamjor samajhenge
 i suffered a lot for 4 years, now it would be a weakness to keep quiet - Hrithik Roshanyadi is walking on the road and if someone abuses me, it would be right for me to keep going, because it does not affect my life
 lekin koi mujh par pathar phenkna shuru kar de, jisase mujhe or mere parivaar ko nuksaan pahunche, tab chup baithna kamajori hoti he
 It has been four years
 mujhe lagata he maine bahut sah liya
 766 words written earlier, it is said that under the pressure of family, Hrithik decided to break his silence
 isse pehle unhone fasebuk par 766 shabdon kii post main likhaa tha- jab sach katghare main khadaa ho jaataa he, to samaaj, parivaar or bachche sabko bhugatna padataa he
 Even when Kangana had demanded an apology from Hrithik on national television, her family had asked her to break the silence
 report ke mutabik ab parivaar ke hi logon ne unhen samajhaayaa he ki unki chuppi kaa galat matlab nikaala ja saktaa he, isliye unhen apana paksh rakhana chahie

 spikar ne apni pahchaan bhi nahin bataai lekin guard ko bura bhala kehane lage
 After this incident, the Gandhi Municipal Civil Hospital Administration gave a month's notice to the Elite Security Services, which looked after the security in the hospital, and asked them to cancel the contract
 haalanki is agency ko april 2019 tak ke liye contract mila tha
 The hospital administration says that the reason is not the speaker but there were many other complaints against this agency, so the contract was canceled

 Saya Developers director Manoj Jain says that this act will definitely build trust between the builder and the buyers, but there is a fear among the people about what could be a change in this act
