 Now the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has also said that they should resign

 Most people in the RSS also believe that Vasundhara should resign
 sangh ke senior netaaon main is baat par charchaa chal rahi he ki vasundhara kis samay istipha den, jisase party ko sabase kam nuksaan ho
 Vasundhara is arriving in Delhi on Friday for a meeting of the NITI Aayog
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki wo dilli main party ke alaakaman se milengi or puure maamle par apni safai dengi
 After hearing the explanation of Vasundhara's resignation, the BJP high command will clear its stand

 In such a situation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi used to be angry, but the Prime Minister is unhappy with the absence of his mps during the voting of this proposal more than the passing of the amendment proposal

 vipaksh ne 57 ke mukaable 118 voton se yah prastaav paas kara liya
 During this period, the mps of BJP and NDA were absent, including some ministers of Modi government
 haalanki, bijepi or endie ke ye anupasthiti saansad bhi rajyasabha main maujuud rahete to bhi sarkaar is prastaav ko paas karaane se roak nahin paati
 Nevertheless, a strong message has been given by Modi to all the mps that whenever such situation comes in future, they have to be present in the House

 pradhanmantri is dauraan khud isro main maujuud the
 After the success of the mission, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, 'today MOM (mars Orbiter Mission) has got a meeting with Mars
 aaj mangal ko mom mil gai
 i was confident that this mission would be successful
 kyonki mom kabhi niraash nahin karti
 On this day, India successfully reached Mars

 ' dilli uniwarsity essi, asti, obisi teachers forum kii baithak main shikshakon ne nai shiksha niti par raksha pakshakaha- is policy ke jariye ucch shiksha se vanchit karne kii sajeesh kar rahi he sarkaaraliya faisla, kaha sarkaar ke shikshak sangh ko duuta main nahin karenge votedilli uniwarsity teachers association (DUTA) chunaav ko lekar essi-asti-obisi teachers forum kii guuruuvaar ko baithak yojit kii gai
 It was discussed in the meeting that what will be the impact of the new education policy on the candidates of Dalit, backward classes
 ye baithak diu ke north campus main hui
 The meeting was chaired by the newly elected Chairman of the Forum Prof
 kailash prakaash singh yadav ne kii
 Teachers from various colleges took part in the meeting
 yahaan nai shiksha niti ke saath-saath kathith taur par sarkaar ke shikshak sangh ke jo ummidavaar duuta chunaav main khadey kiye gaye hai, unako vot nahin karenge
 It was also decided that soon the Forum would take to the streets in protest against the government's new education policy
 baithak main shikshakon ne nai shiksha niti ke tahat aane vaale vibhinn niti niyamon par baatcheet hui
 In this, the teachers strongly criticized the government on the new education policy, and said it against the Dalit, backward teachers
 in shikshakon kaa kahana tha ki nai shiksha niti arakshit shrenee ke abhyarthiyon ko ucch shiksha main aane se rokatii he
 While giving his views on the new education policy, former member of the University Council of Delhi, Prof
 hansraj 'suman 'ne kaha ki vishvavidhyalayon / collejon main pehle sthaayee niyukti prakriya ke baad 1 saal kaa probeshan kaa kaarykaal rakhaa gaya tha
 Now it has been reduced to 5 years under the new education policy, this is an example of anti-teacher policy
 isamen sanstha ke principal or vaais chancelar ke hastkshep kii puri gunjaaish hogi ki wo kise probeshan period ke baad sthaayee niyukti de yaa phir 5 saal ke liye probeshan period main rakhe
 Pro
 suman ne bataaya he ki yahi nahin iske aage ke niyam or bhi khatarnaak he
 Under this, a process of assessment of teachers has been made after every five years in which the principal will have the monopoly of promotion of the teacher
 isse manamaani kii sambhaavna badhegi
 So far the position of the university / college is that it is completely independent after permanent appointment for its teaching work
 ab nai shiksha niti main vah principal ke dabaav main rahakar kaary karegaa jo ucch shiksha kii prakruti ke viruddh he
 In this, teachers of Dalit and backward classes will always be the target of the principal due to discrimination
 unhone chintaa vyakt karte hue kaha ki is tarah se sarkaar sthaayee niyukti kii prakriya ko 5-5 saal ke assesament main baandhakar uski prakruti ko khatm kar dena chaahati he
 This will make the teacher like a slave where the teaching work will be completely affected
 baithak main dow
 Vinay Kumar said that after this policy, higher education will remain for special sections because the way the government is privatizing education, it seems that higher education will remain a dream for Dalit, Adivasi and backward classes
 unhone yuva peedi se aahwan kiya he ki vah sarkaar kii ucch shiksha virdohi nai shiksha niti ko lagu nahin hone de
 They should fight it out otherwise the reserved class will not be able to get higher education in future
 nai shiksha niti par apane adhyakshiya bhaashan main bolte hue pro
 Kailash Prakash Singh Yadav said that the new education policy will affect the recruitment process because when the promotion of teachers will be interrupted by the assessment of 5 years, many qualified candidates who want to come in the field of education will now serve other institutions
 iske atirikt nijee kshetra ke vishvavidhyalayon main sarkaar sansthaanon se adhik vetan par bulaakar yadi yogya shikshakon ko rakhaa jaayegaa to swaabhaavik he ki sarkari santhaan kii gunvattta par bhi sawaal uthne lagegaa
 By giving the process of appraisal of teachers in the right from institution to promotion to promotion, there will be an atmosphere of fear among the teachers in the government sector
 nai shiksha niti main moolyankan kaa praaroop vidhyaarthee ko bhi diya gaya he
 Naturally, any teacher will facilitate more students in internal assessment and in-class attendance than they teach, creating a transactional situation towards their assessment, which will create a more dangerous situation for the student
 baithak ke ant main sabhi shikshakon ne sarkaar dwaara jald hi aa rahi nai shiksha niti kaa purajor virodh karne kaa faisla liya
 In the meeting, Dr
 anil kumaar, dow

 Apart from this, the new education policy was against the reserved classes

 It is also necessary to understand whether human settlements can ever be established on Mars

 So far only Russia, Japan, China, USA and European Space Agency have tried to go to Mars, out of which only the US and European Space Agency have been successful
 1960 se 45 mishan launch kiye ja chuke hai, jinamein ek-tihaai asafal rahe
 The failure of China's mission in 2011 is the latest example
 agar bharat mangal grah tak pahunch gaya to puri tarah apane dam par yah kamyaabi hasil karne vaala duniya kaa doosraa desh hoga
 Supporting this first Mars expedition from India, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said, "it is exciting to see more and more countries taking part in search efforts, especially in Mars exploration missions
" isamen ham communication or data transmishan ke jariye sahyog de rahe hai
 We too have a stake in it
 ”bahut se logon kaa maananaa he ki yah 21veen shatabdi main asia main antariksh hode kii shuruyaat he
 Two regional rivals India and China are competing in this modern marathon between planets
 mangal tak pahunchane kaa teesraa ummidavaar bhi maidan main he
 Japan's Nozomi Mars satellite failed in 1998
 vaise to antariksh abhiyaan ke lagbhag har pahalu main china ne bharat ko maat di he; usne pehla maanav mishan 2003 main bheja tha; uskaa chandra mishan bhi bharat se pehle hua tha phir bhi mangal kii yatra shaayad bharat ko badhat dilaa degi
 In November 2011, China's first Mars probe Yinghuo-1 aboard Russia's satellite Phobos Grunt failed to go into space
 isro ke chairman kaa kahana he, “ham kisi se hode nahin laga rahe hai
 India's Mars expedition has its own relevance
 ” phir bhi ve maanate hai ki is abhiyaan se kahin na kahin ‘rashtriya gaurav’ judaa he
 "the 50-year-old mechanical engineer Subian Arunan, who headed the Mangalyaan-making team, said that in the last 15 months, he has spent most nights at the satellite center
 arunan is jaldbaaji kii ek adhik tarksangat vaigyanik vajah bataate hai
 He says that the chance of launch for Mars gets only once every 26 months
 is avadhi main ham pieselvi jaise kam shakti ke launture ke jariye bhi mangal tak pahunch sakate hai
 Arunan says that the real reason for this haste is the constant changes in the position of the planets
 bharat kaa yah yaan 10 maheenon se zyada samay ke liye antariksh main rahegaa
 If the launch opportunity is missed in 2013, then the next opportunity will be in 2016 itself
 isliye arunan or unke saathiyon ne zyaadaatar chhuttiyon main bhi kaam kiya or kaam ko dedline par puraa kiya he
 India's Mars mission will be off the beaten path as PSLV cannot provide enough power to put the Mars orbit directly on Mars
 yah satellite ek maheene tak prithvi kaa chakkar lagayegaa or satellite main lagi rocket motor ke saath usamen jamaa 852 kilo eendhan kaa istemaal karte hue itnaa veg hasil kar legaa ki november main 20 karod kilometre se bhi lambii yatra shuru kar sakegaa
 In this way, it will be the first spacecraft of India to come out of the Earth's sphere of influence

 The seven-storey building ie 44 meter height PSLV rocket will have a weight of 300 tons approximately equal to the weight of a fully loaded 747 Boeing Jumbo Jet
 rocket par najar rakhane ke liye bharat pehali baar prashanth mahaasaagar main do vishesh jahaaj tainaat karegaa
 When the satellite reaches close to Mars after nine months of travel, the speed of Mangalyaan will be slowed so that it can be tied to the gravity of Mars
 ek baar aisa ho jane par yah yaan andakaar kaksha main ghoomegaa or kareeb chah maheene tak mangal kaa adhyayan karegaa
 According to ISRO, the biggest challenge of this mission will be to communicate with Mangalyaan at a distance of 20 to 40 crore kilometers
 bangaloru se satellite tak ekataraf hua sandesh pahunchane main kam-se-kam 20 minute lagenge
 a large dish antenna has been installed at Byalalu near Bangalore for this purpose
 satellite or control room ke bich dotarafa sampark main kam se kam 40 minute kaa antaraal hoga
 The average speed of the aircraft is 700 kilometers per hour
 jaraa-si chook hone par kareeb 9,000 kilometre prati ghanta kii raftaar se chalata antariksh yaan aasaani se gum ho saktaa he
 To avoid any such mishap, ISRO has installed four computers in the satellite, so that the satellite can be fully controlled
 ab sawaal yah he ki jo desh apni 40 karod janata ko aaj bhi bijli nahin de saktaa or jiske 60 karod nivasee khule main shouch karte hai kya uske liye yah bahut oonchi chalaang he yaa shaikh chilli kaa pilav? is sawaal kaa jawaab is baat par nirbhar he ki aap vibhaajan rekha ke kis taraf khadey hai

 According to the police, what Bunty revealed during interrogation is even more shocking
 banty ne bataaya ki 18 agast ko usne apane 2 saal ke bete lakshya kii hatya munak nahar main dubokar kar di kyonki wo uski dekhbhaal nahin kar paa rahaa tha
 The comments bahari dilli ke disipi vikramjit singh ne bataaya ki banty ko sharaab pine kii lat he or isi lat ke chalate wo pai pai ko mohataaj ho gaya

 15 agast ko wo donon betiyon or bete ko ghar main band kar chalaa gaya or phir 18 agast ko lautaa to bete ko ghar se uthaakar munak nahar main daal diya
 On August 19, neighbors informed the police after the smell of the house, then the daughters were recovered and they are currently undergoing treatment

 ek taraf centre main narendra modi sarkaar ne anya pichhadaa ayog (OBC) ko sanvaidhanik darja dilaakar ise chunaavon main bhunaane kii taiyaari main he to vahiin duusari taraf uttar pradesh main bijepi chupchaap pichhadi jatiyon ko ek-ek kar saadhane main jute gai he
 Seeing the rapid rise of the grand alliance, Keshav Prasad Maurya has been given the responsibility of organizing caste-wise conferences of all the backward castes in Uttar Pradesh and linking them one by one to the bjp's programs
 party adhyaksh amit shah ke is farmaan ke baadabijapi jativaar meetingkarne main juty he
 In the last 2 days, in Lucknow, BJP has organized a conference of extremely backward castes like Prajapati i
e
 Kumhar, Nai and Rajbhar and in the next few days the conference of other castes is going to be called
 sabhi sammelnon main keshav maury or mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne modi sarkaar ke nitiyon or kaaryakramon ko unke saamne rakhaa, lekin jati jutakar party yah sandesh dena chaahati thi ki sab kuch ek taraf or jati kii golbandi ek taraf
 At the conference of Prajapati i
e
 potter, Yogi Adityanath talked about Mati Kala on the one hand, while SP and BSP were also whipped in the name of caste
 mukhyamantri adityanath ne kaha tha ki pichhali sarkaron ne nagn tandav kiya, pichhadon ke naam par pichhadon or daliton ko vanchit kiya gaya
 The survey revealed that many castes did not get the benefit of the development plan even after independence
 hamane samgr gaanv yojana ke saath-saath vikaas kaary kiya
 While Yogi Adityanath counted his work for the backward, Keshav Prasad Maurya once again reminded Prime Minister Modi's caste at the Backward Castes Conference
 maury ne jatiyon ke in sammelnon mempradhanmantri modiko desh kaa sabase taqatvar or bada netaa bataate hue unki jati kaa bhi ullekh kiya or kaha ki jab desh kaa pradhanmantri pichhadi jati kaa he to in jatiyon ko ab kahin or dekhnaa nahin chahie
 After these caste conferences, Keshav Maurya held special talks from today till date and told about these conferences happening for backward castes
 iske baad bijepi gurjar, jat, saini, shakya, mallaah, nishad samet or duusari jatiyon kii bhi meeting yojit kar rahi he or unhen bhi iske jariye bijepi kii vichaardhaara kii ghutti pilaai jaaegi
 Now it is to be seen how Keshav Prasad, an expert in caste organization, is able to make this grand alliance of backward castes in front of the grand alliance in 2019

 The DRDO lab located in the lap of the Himalayas is not only searching for Sanjeevani for the Indian Army but also seeing wonders there
 hajaaron feet kii oonchai par ladakh ke shahar main diardio kii prayogshaala hare-bhare gaanv kii tarah dikhaai detii he
 The Leh-based Defense Institute of High Altitude Research is playing an important role in taking Prime Minister Narendra Modi's slogan of Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan a step further
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne raashtra ke naam apane sambodhan main ladakh kii isi organic prayogshaala kaa zikr kiya tha
 Interestingly, so far in this green laboratory, DRDO has prepared organic 'bombs' like cabbage and pumpkin
 darasal, is prayogshaala main hathiyaar nahin banate hai balki sarhad par simaaon kii hifaazat karne vaale javaanon ko behatar khuraaq mili, iske liye is prayogshaala main vaigyanik aadhunik takanic se behtareen paidaavaar kii ijad karte hai
 drdo's Green Revolution Laboratory is growing flowers, cauliflower, cabbage and many other vegetables aimed at the need of modern technology troops and better income for the farmers of Ladakh
 siachin jaisi haddiyaan galaa dene vaali hajaaron feet kii oonchai par mushkil bhare halaat main sainikon ko rasad ke saath-saath behatar khuraaq mili, iske liye bhi diardio ke vaigyanikon ne bina mitti ke paalak or tamaato kii paushtik paidaavaar ke liye takneekee jaanch kii he
 OP Chaurasia, Director of Defense Institute of High Altitude Research, DIHAR, Leh, said that we have developed this technique for how to grow and grow green vegetables without soil in this lab
 chaurasia kaa kahana he ki durgam paristhitiyon main bhi is takanic ke jariye fasal 30 din main taiyaar ho jaati he
 Research is being done on more than one crop here
 jukini naamak sabji jo aamtaur par pashchimi deshon main pai jaati he, ladakh kii is prayogshaala main ugaai ja rahi jukini kaa aakaar or chamak bazaar main milane vaale jukini se kahin behatar he
 Not only this, the pumpkin is astonishing in this laboratory of DRDO
 yahaan ugane vaale kaddu kaa vajan 40 se 50 kilo tak ho saktaa he
 Scientist Doctor Dorji Aanchuk told Aaj Tak that growing such vegetables is a challenge in a white desert like Leh where the temperature in winter falls below minus 25
 is prayogshaala main tarbooz bam bhi dekhne ko mila
 Surprisingly because Ladakh is known as the White Desert, where the weather is cold throughout the year and watermelons are commonly found on the banks of rivers
 vaigyanik doctor sering kaa kahana he ki yahaan kii takanic un kisaanon ko dete hai jisase maidani ilaakon main kisaan jahaan ek hectare main dedh lakh rupye kamaate hai vahiin ladakh main is fasal se 10 se 12 lakh rupye kama sakate hai
 Explain that in this laboratory, now a plant called Solo will be carved and herbs will be made from it
 isi paudhe ke bare main piem modi ne apane sambodhan main bataaya tha
 The plant is called Sonu in Ladakhi language and its scientific name is Radiola, about which Dr
 OP Chaurasia, director of the laboratory of DRDO, said that it includes all diseases, including radiation related to high altitude sickness and fighting cancer, which enhance physical ability
 Fighting ability

 5 stars 'go goa gon' ek kamedi film he, jahaan kunal ke van liners hansaate hai
 Anand Tiwari, who plays Bani, also has a tremendous acting
 virdaas kaa kaam thik he, vahiin puja or saf ke paas zyada kuch karne ko nahin dikhataa
 The comments film hansaati he, par ek acchhee kahani kii kami khalati he
 The audience can guess the story well in advance, so the story does not give so much fun
 kai baar lagata he screen play aage badhata he, par phir waapas aa jaataa he, jisaki vajah se kahani dhimi pad jaati he or ubaau lagane lagati he
 The songs of the film are good, like Baba Ji Ki Booti
 
 
 
 It is difficult for the Indian audience to understand zombies, but the film tries to explain the meaning of zombies
 agar jombi aap samajhate hai or bina logic lagaae film dekhte hai to shaayad yah kahani aapako jam jaae
 The rating for this film is 2
 5 stars
 The film laughs, but lacks a good story
 kahani kaa anumaan darshak pehle se hi laga sakate hai isliye kahani itnaa majaa nahin de paati
 Many times the screen play progresses, but then comes back, due to which the story slows down and starts to get boring
 film ke gane achche hai, jaise baba ji kii booti

 dilli main siyaasi hadacamp much gaya or somvaar ko dilli main charchaa kaa vishay bana rahaa ki kya kejariwal kii sarkaar ja rahi he? i am covering the Aam Aadmi Party from day one, so i am putting some things in front
 dilli main aam aadmi party ki sarkaar bani nahin thi banavaayi gayi thi
 The Congress had given support without asking, because if the re-election were held, the Congress might not have won even eight seats in Delhi, and anyway the Congress is more favored than the Aam Aadmi Party, so the Congress formed the government
 bijepi bhi chaahati thi ki aap kii sarkaar bane jisase ek to kejariwal kii kathani or kerani main antar bataaya jaae or doosraa jo nuksaan aam aadmi party ne bijepi kaa dilli main kiya kahin vah loksabhaa main naa kar de, modi kaa rath na roak de
 That is, the one who created the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi has the responsibility of running the government
 yah baat aravind kejariwal acchhee tarah jaanate hai, isliye unhone ye daanv khelkar dhamkee di
 However, both Congress and BJP are saying that we are against the way of bringing Lokpal, not Lokpal

 desh kii rajdhani mentmatarake aag lagane vaale daam kaa asar ab pyaaj par bhi padane laga he
 In Delhi's Ghazipur mandi, onion prices are seeing a tremendous increase
 'ajtak' kii team ne gajipur mandi main thok main subjiyan bechney vaale vyapriyon se baatcheet ke alaava purvi dilli ke kuch ilaakon ke khudara bazaar kaa daura kiya, jahaan janata tamaato ke saath-saath pyaaj ke bade hue daamon se halaakan he
 Let's first look at the wholesale price of interest
 pichley hafte tak gajipur mandi main 20 rupee prati kilo bik rahe pyaaj kii keemat aaj paanch agast ko 25 se 27 rupee prati kilo tak pahunch gai he
 The general public facing inflation is now starting to turn to the market
 bura haal un logon kaa he, jo local bazaar main footkar pyaaj 40 rupee prati kilo tak kharid rahe hai
 Ved Prakash, who came to buy gazipur mandi vegetable, told that today he has bought five kilograms of onion due to increased prices
 unka kahana he ki mandi ke andar unhen tamaato ke footkar daam or local bazaar ke footkar daam main koi fark najar nahi aayaa
 At the same time, Deepak, who is buying vegetables in the mandi, told that the inflation of onion and tomato has completely spoiled the taste of the plate
 pichley ek maheene se tamaato ke daam main koi kami nahin ai he
 Alam is that in Ghazipur mandi, the retail price of tomato is 65 to 70 rupees per kg
 vyapriyon ke mutabik dilli main philhal shimla or bangaleru ke tamaato kii bikri zyada he
 However, the wholesale price of tomatoes in the mandi is around Rs 50, which is being sold at Rs 80 per kg in different areas of Delhi
 purvi dilli ke gita colony ke mahange pyaaj auratmatarase pareshaan kulwinder gajipur mandi main aksar subjiyan kharidne aate hai
 Kulwinder said that expensive tomatoes have been procured for a month, due to which his budget has deteriorated and it is also difficult to celebrate the festival
 gajipur mandi ke baad 'ajtak' kii team ne lakshmi nagar ilaake kaa daura kiya, to pyaaj or tamaato ke daam sunakar behad hairaani hui
 Onion was being sold at Rs 40 per kg and tomatoes at Rs 80 per kg
 lakshmi nagar main rahane vaaleen neelam sharma bataati hai ki mahange tamaato kii vajah se unka maheene bhar kaa bajet hafte bhar ke bajet main simat kar rah gaya he
 He says that to maintain the taste in the plate, she cannot stop buying onions and tomatoes, but now one and a half tomatoes have to be replaced instead of 3 tomatoes
 neelam ne sarkaar se zaruri kadam uthaane kii apil bhi kii he
 Currently, according to traders in Ghazipur mandi, onion and tomato may remain expensive in the month of August due to crop failure
 bihar main nitish kumaar cabinet ne buudhvaar ko sarkari sevak aachaar niyamavali, 1976 main sanshodhan ke prastaav ko manjuuri de di he
 Under this, government employees have been banned from drinking liquor under service rules
 bihar main lagusharabbandiko or majbootee se lagu karne ke iraade se sarkari karmchaariyon ke sarvice rule main yah sanshodhan kiya gaya he
 According to the proposal passed in the cabinet, drinking of liquor of a government employee or a judicial service officer has been completely banned
 patrakaron ko is sanshodhan ke bare main jaankaree dete hue cabinet sachiv brijesh malhotra ne kaha kii 1976 ke sarvice rule ke tahat sarkari karmchaariyon ko sirf kaam karne kii jagah par sharaab pine kii yaa phir maadak padaarth ke istemaal kii pabandi thi, anyathaa vah or kahin par sharaab yaa maadak padaarth kaa seven kar saktaa tha

 The Bombay High Court has said that the witness who said that Bollywood actor Salman Khan was driving an SUV that crushed people sleeping on the sidewalk is not completely reliable
 adaalat 49 varshiya abhinayta kii apil par jald hi nirnay de sakati he
 In fact, Salman had challenged the decision of the Sessions Court, on which the hearing was completed last week
 somvaar se justise eaar joshi khuli adaalat main apana faisla likhva rahe hai
 The comments satr nyaayalay ke faisle, tathaa abhiyojan paksh or bachaav paksh kii daleelon par gaur karne ke saath-saath har pench par dhyaan dete hue adaalat faisla likh rahi he
 
 
 For example, Salman Khan went to the Rain Bar, this proves, but no one had seen Salman drinking alcohol that night
 iske alaava, hotel ke bill kii taarikh ko lekar bhi uljhan he, kyonki police ne 27 sitambar kaa bill pesh kiya, lekin salmaan jab vahaan se nikle, tab taarikh badal chuki thi
 By the way, the confusion over Salman Khan himself was driving, because no one had seen Salman Khan driving
 kuch or bhi nukte hai, jinhen sambhawatah dhyaan main rakhaa ja rahaa he
 Eg - witness number 8 stated that there were four people in the car, and after that the prosecution did not cross-examine him, which should have happened
 jaise - haadase ke baad darj exiaar salmaan khan ke sharaab pie hone kii baat nahin likhi gai thi, or vah aarope kuch din baad joda gaya
 Like - witness number 7 said during cross examination that at that time Salman Khan's mouth was not smelling of alcohol, and he was not stumbling
 jaise - salmaan khan ne us raat sharaab pi thi yaa nahin, isaki jaanch ke liye blad sample lene se pehle salmaan kii sahmati zaruri thi, lekin form par salmaan ke dastakhat nahin paae gaye
 The court is writing the verdict, taking into consideration every screw, along with the decision of the Sessions Court, and the arguments of the prosecution and the defense
 
 
 masalan, salmaan khan rain baar main gaye the, yah to sabit hota he, lekin salmaan ko us raat kisi ne bhi sharaab pite hue nahin dekha tha
 Apart from this, there is also confusion over the date of the hotel bill, as the police introduced the bill on 27 September, but the date had changed when Salman left from there
 vaise, salmaan khan khud gaadi chalaa rahe the, is par bhi bhram barkaraar he, kyonki kisi ne salmaan khan ko gaadi chalaate nahin dekha tha
 There are other nuances, which are probably being taken into consideration
 jaise - gavaah number 8 ne kaha tha ki car main chaar log the, or iske baad abhiyojan paksh ne use cross ekzamin nahin kiya, jo hona chahie tha
 For example, the FIR registered after the incident, Salman Khan was not written about drinking alcohol, and that charge was added a few days later
 jaise - gavaah number 7 ne cross ekzamination ke dauraan kaha tha ki us samay salmaan khan ke munh se sharaab kii bu nahin aa rahi thi, or vah ladkadaa bhi nahin rahe the
 For example, Salman Khan's consent was required before taking a blood sample to check whether he had drunk alcohol that night, but Salman's signature was not found on the form
 kuch or bhi nukte hai, jinhen sambhawatah dhyaan main rakhaa ja rahaa he
 Eg - witness number 8 stated that there were four people in the car, and after that the prosecution did not cross-examine him, which should have happened
 jaise - haadase ke baad darj exiaar salmaan khan ke sharaab pie hone kii baat nahin likhi gai thi, or vah aarope kuch din baad joda gaya
 Like - witness number 7 said during cross examination that at that time Salman Khan's mouth was not smelling of alcohol, and he was not stumbling
 jaise - salmaan khan ne us raat sharaab pi thi yaa nahin, isaki jaanch ke liye blad sample lene se pehle salmaan kii sahmati zaruri thi, lekin form par salmaan ke dastakhat nahin paae gaye
 Delhi University Student Union DUSU organized a two-day seminar on Saraswati river civilization

 Experts on the Saraswati River and Aryan Theory elaborated in the seminar

 The University of Delhi is an important milestone in that campaign
 unhone kaha ki angrejon ne bharat ko arya-dravid, uttar-dakshin-purv-pashchim se lekar jati aadi ke aadhaar par todane kii bahut koshish kii
 But this attempt was completely based on lies

 Regarding these subjects, the leftists created confusion among the students through the academic world, due to which many students got away from their own rich tradition and idea of indianness
 kisi bhi vivaadit pahalu par chaatro ko sabhi pakshon se parichit hone kaa adhikaar he lekin unka brain wash karne ke liye aksar ek hi paksh se rubaru karaayaa gaya
 Now there is a need to change such trends so that their multi-faceted talent can be developed

 That is, four out of every five smart phones are running on the Android operating system
 har din 15 lakh se zyada log nayaa android divaais kharid rahe hai
 This year, Android will touch a figure around which is a dream for any company
 2014 main android istemaal karne waalon kii sankhya ek billian paar kar jaaegi
 Android completed the journey of reaching one billion people in just six years
 bazaar main aane vaala pehla android phone achatisi dream tha jise 22 oktober 2008 ko laanch kiya gaya tha
 Today the owner of Android software is Google but it was not discovered by Google
 'andrid inc' company kii sthapana endi rubin ne kuch logon ke saath mil kar 2003 main kii thi
 But later the company's financial condition turned sour
 tabhi google kii najar is company par padi jo smart phones ke liye ek naye tarah kaa software banane main juty thi

 Why Android's magic is awesome-1
 phone ko jaisaa chaaho vaisaa banaao :customization, yani phone main apane hisaab se badlaav karne kii aazaadee android kii sabase badi khaasiyat he
 If you consider yourself a tech savvy, want to go deep into the phone and set every feature according to your needs, then no other phone like Android will give you a discount
 phone ke launture se lekar luk tak, hompej se lekar animeshan level tak har cheez aapke man mutabik bananaa yahaan sambhav he
 Blackberry, iphone and Windows do not give you such discounts

 It is difficult to even think about the world of Internet today without Google
 agar aap meri tarah, google ke diwane hai to android ke alaava kisi or phone ke bare main soch bhi nahin sakate
 All of Google's applications like search, Google map, youtube are also in all other phones, but in Android, the case of two bodies is like a life
 sochane kii baat he ki android agar google kaa hi baccha he to kuch chijen jarur aisi hogin jo dusron ko nahin milengi
 Google Map itself is Aladdin's lamp and there are so many features hidden within it that you will be surprised
 appal jaisi company ne google map ko takkar dene ke liye apana map banane kii koshish kii or yphone main use daalaa
 There was so much abuse that Apple not only had to apologize to its users but also had to come back to the shelter of Google Map

 Google Now only Android 4

 There are a lot of apps in the Khajangoogle Play Store - 10,00,000 - that is, more than a million apps and their number is continuously increasing
 yun samajhen kii agar aap har ap ko downlod karke paanch minute ke liye aajmaana chahen to aapako das saal se zyada lag jaaenge
 App is available for every kind of choice, every kind of need in the world
 agar aap koi ap khareednaa bhi nahin bhi chahen to muft ke hi itane eps hai ki aapako credit card nahin hone kii kami khalegi nahin

 har bajet ke liye darjanon phonebajet kam hona kabhi bhi android phone kharidne ke raste main roda nahin ban saktaa
 Since Google provides Android software to all phone companies for free, there is a plethora of companies making Android phones
 saste desi brands se lekar samsung or achatisi jaise maharathi is maidan main hai or ab to suna he ki apana purana janaa pahachaanaa nokia bhi android phone laane kii taiyaari kar chukaa he
 So the budget in the Android world does not mean that you will have to buy the old, stale and outdated iphone 4 worldwide
 lekin android ke bare main ye bhi jaan len-1
 In terms of security, the weakest Android software is 'open source', that is, anyone can make an app for it
 yahi baat android ko suraksha ke lihaaj se kamjor banaati he
 Not all research has shown that it is easier for any hacker to hack Android phone than any other phone
 malware ho yaa ghatiya nakli eps, google play store sabakaa adda he
 Google's quality control cannot be called good in terms of launching the app in the market

 You will feel bad about the new old version when you buy a new flashing phone from your hard-earned sweat and your friend takes the phone in your hand and says - Hey, this is an outdated one! This is very much the case with Android phones
 darasal andrid software to google bana kar companiyon ko muhaiyaa karaata he lekin har phone company apane phone ko alag dikhaane ke liye, uski alag pahchaan banane ke liye, android software ke saath kuch badlaav karke use apane phones main daalati he
 The result is that when Google launches new and better version of Android software, you cannot download it directly to your phone
 aapako intjaar karnaa hoga ki aapaki phone company aapke phone ke model ke hisaab se android software taiyaar karke aapako muhaiyaa karaae
 Many times this wait never ends because the phone companies do not bring a new version of Android for the old model
 is vakt android software kaa sabase nayaa varjan kit cat he
 But knowing this, you will find that less than two percent of Android phones have the sweetness of kitkat
 3
 Battery's chakra battery is the sad touch of every smart phone
 lekin android main ye dikkat sabase zyada he
 Actually, Android is a very powerful software designed for multitasking
 lekin powerful hone kaa ye bhi matlab he ki ise betry kii khuraaq zyada chahie
 So many times people complain about their phone getting too hot
 android phone kharidte samay betry kii power par gaur karnaa behad jaruri he varna din dhalane se pehle hi aap charger khojate hue najar aaenge
 The only relief is that in most Android phones, you can buy a new battery and replace it yourself
 yphone kii tarah aapako betry badalane ke liye bhi sarvice centre jane kii jarurat nahin he
 4
 ghatiya phones kii bharmarendroid phone chunki naam se bikta he isliye har koi is bahati ganga main haath dhonaa chahta he
 All companies are selling phones so cheaply that anyone can be tempted by looking at them
 lekin muft ke software or saste chinij maal se taiyaar android phone aapke liye sirdard bhi ban saktaa he
 There are many companies that sell cheap phones from China and capitalize their name to capitalize on the popularity of Android
 agar ye phone kharaab ho jaaen to company kaa sarvice centre puure shahar main aap khojate hue thak jaaengen or phone thik hokar milane main bees din lagenge
 Think about these things before buying a phone
 jaisaa ki hamane pehle baat kii, android ek powerful ingine kii tarah he jise chalaane ke liye damdaar hardware kii jarurat hoti he
 So if your budget is less than eight thousand then think of buying Windows Phone instead of Android
 5
 All phones are slowed down due to hang and crash problems
 lekin android phone main purana kachra kuch is tarah jamaa hota jaataa he ki usase chhutkaaraa paanaa mushkil hota he
 You try all the cleaner apps from the play store but you will see that the phone did not talk
 kabhi phone hang hoga, kabhi krash hoga to kabhi itnaa slo ho jayega ki aapako gussa aayega
 This problem comes more in cheap low RAM phones
 kabhi aap dekhegein ki aapane phone se saare photo, gane, video - sab kuch hataa diya tab bhi phone Low Memory dikhaata rahegaa or aap koi nayaa ap downlod nahin kar paaenge
 Many people may also get a headache that every day an app is updated in the phone and your data bill keeps increasing
 madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivarajsingh chouhan ne kaha he ki desh kaa sabase bada mafia congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke ghar main baitha he

 Actually, due to the high amount of arsenic in the water of most villages of this area, the water here is not drinkable

 Since November last year, the problem of drinking water of the villagers has ended forever

 yuvi takanic se saaf kiye gaye pani ko 'sulabh jal' naam se 20 litre kii bottle main 10 rupee prati bottle kii dar se bharkar ghar-ghar pahunchaaya jaataa he
 Bindeshwar Pathak, founder of Sulabh International, said, 'we are providing drinking water at the rate of fifty paise per liter
 yah mineral water kii tarah to nahin he lekin yah duniya main sabase sasta surakshit peyajal he
 'with the intention of spreading the foot across the country to the three districts of West Bengal, the plan to provide clean water is successful and Sulabh International is also ready to take it to the rest of the country

 The Supreme Court's decision has now come in the bottleneck over the EAMCET 2014 counseling conducted by Jawaharlal Nehru Technical University Hyderabad (JNTUH)
 somvaar ko court ne kaha ki telugana or andhra pradesh main profeshnal collejon kii admician prakriya is maheene tak samaapt ho jaani chahie
 Counseling dates for EAMCET 2014 in both states will be decided soon after the court's decision
 court ke faisle ke baad andhra pradesh state council of hair ajukeshan ke chairman el venugopal reddy ne kaha,'ham jald hi admishans cameti ke saath ek meeting karenge, jisamen telugana ke adhikariyon ko bhi bulaayaa jayega'
 According to Reddy, counseling in Telangana will begin on August 14 and certificate verification will end by August 23
 is baat se spasht he ki donon rajyon main admician prakriya 23 agast se shuru ho jaaegi
 Taking an interesting turn, the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) said that it will conduct engineering counseling in both the states
 TSCHE chairman tii paapi reddy ne kaha,' chuking JNTUH hyderabad (telugana ) main sthit he isliye TSCHE counselling conduct karaayegi
 Reddy gave this information after talking to Chief Minister Chandrashekhar Rao late on Monday night
 isi ke saath telugana sarkaar ne yah bhi spasht kar diya ki telugana sarkaar or uski parishad supreme court ke nirdeshon kaa paalan karegi
 Let us tell you that on 4 August 2014, the Supreme Court had ordered that counseling of professional courses should be finished before 31 August
 lekin baad main telugana sarkaar ne ek yachika daayar kar 31 oktober tak kaa samay maanga tha
 Now the court has made it clear in its decision that there will be no loss of students due to the division of states

 Actress Kajol is set to make a comeback on the big screen soon, but says she is a very lazy actress
 39 saal kii kaajol ne varsh 2001 main abhinay se duuri bana lee thi, iske baad unhone varsh 2006 main romantic film 'phna' se vaapasi kii thi
 After this, she appeared only in guest roles
 aakhri baar vah karan johar ke production kii film 've aar family' (2010) main pramukh bhoomika main dikhi thim
 Kajol said, i am very lazy
 
 
 main had se zyada kaam yaa filmein nahin kar sakati
 Two films a year are too much for me and it also makes me feel that i am working
 main kisi bhi film ko tab tak apana nahin maanati, jab tak main usee shooting shuru na kar duun
 The comments charchaa main nahin rahane ke baavjood logon kii pasandida bane rahane ke sawaal par unhone kaha, ho saktaa he maine kaam se duuri banaai ho, isliye log mere saath kaam karnaa chaahate hon
 i have been working for 20 years, but i have done very few work and few films
 aise kai log hai, jinhone mujhase teen guna yaa chaar guna zyada filmein kii hai
 Kajol is now set to return from her husband Ajay Devgan's production film
 vah bataati hai, film kii patakatha or kahani bahut acchhee he, lekin abhi main is bare main zyada baat nahin kar sakati
 He said, of course i will keep doing films continuously, but i want some time too
 meraa ek bharaa-puraa jivan he - pati, do bachche, ghar, production company or anya chije hai
 That's why i do similar films, so that i feel it is necessary to do this film
 iske baad vah sirf mehmaan bhoomikaaon main hi najar ain
 She was last seen in a lead role in Karan Johar's production 'we Are Family' (2010)
 kaajol ne kaha, main bahut aalsee hum
 
 
 i can't do too much work or movies
 mere liye saal main do filmein bahut hai or isse mujhe yah mahasoos bhi hota rahata he ki main kaam kar rahi hum
 i do not consider any film as my own until i start shooting
 tippaniyan On the question of being the favorite of the people despite not being in the discussion, he said, "I may have kept distance from work, so people want to work with me
" main 20 saal se kaam kar rahi hum, lekin maine kaaphi kam kaam or kam hi filmein kii hai
 There are many people who have done three times or four times more films than me
 kaajol ab apane pati ajay devgan ke production kii film se vaapasi ko taiyaar hai
 She explains, the screenplay and story of the film are very good, but right now i cannot talk too much about it
 unhone kaha, nishchit rup se main lagaataar filmein karti rahuungi, lekin mujhe thodaa samay bhi chahie
 i have a full life - husband, two children, house, production company and other things
 isliye main waisi hi filmein karti hum, jisase lage ki is film ko karnaa jaruri he

 At least this is what Raman Singh's advice says
 science centre ke udghaatan ke maukey par raman singh ne kaha ki pita se hi aate he bacchon main saare gun, isliye galatiyon ke jimmedaar bachche kaise ho sakate he
 Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh spoke on the nuances of science
 mauka tha raipur main science centre ke udghaatan kaa jahaan raman singh bhaashan dete hue diene or jeens kii charchaa kar baithe
 Those who have a lot of knowledge of science know that the similarity and quality-defects of the parents reach the child through DNA
 yahaan tak ki kai bimaariyaan bhi ek peedi se duusari peedi main diene ke saath aa jaati hai
 But you may not have heard it like Raman Singh said about the interpretation of DNA
 chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh ne kaha ki hajaaron saal se dnes or genes chal rahaa he
 i say that if the son makes a mistake, then the father should be paid because the virtue is taking from his own Baba
 chori kar rahaa he, daaka daal rahaa he, balaatkaar kar rahaa he to bete kaa bilkul dosha nahin he
 We have made him as our blood is as our DNA as our thinking is our son
 apradhi betaa nahin hota baap hota he
 The opposition created a ruckus on Chief Minister Raman Singh's statement
 congress kaa sawaal he ki raman singh kya kanoon main badlaav laane kii baat kar rahe hai
 Congress leader in the state and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, Nand Kumar Patel said that i want to ask him what message he wants to convey to the people of the state by talking about this method
 manto ye bhi kahana chaahoonga kii agar wo ye sochate he kii jitne apradhi he jail me un sabko wo chhodana chaahate he or unke pitaaji ko jail me band karnaa chaahate he
 This is his thinking, this statement shows by his statement
 chaliye agar ye maan bhi len ki congress siyasat kii vajah se raman singh kaa virodh kar rahi he
 So why the father, the culprit of the mistakes of the son
 aakhir use bhi to ye sab apane pita se mila tha
 Then how many generations will Raman Singh go back in search of the real culprit
 shaayad diene kii vyakhya karne ke liye mukhyamantri ji ne udhaaharan chunane main chook kar di
 The question is also whether Raman Singh will use DNA theory to tackle the Naxalite problem

 This fact has also been proved in many researches
 5
 If you are sitting inside your stomach, then try to bend your knees and sit inside by breathing for 30 seconds

 Madhya Pradesh is the largest soybean producing state in the country with about 70 per cent of the total production
 yahaan, monsoon tay samay se ek maah der se aayaa or ab itani zyada barish ho rahi he ki hajaaron acre main boe gaye soyabean ke beej sad gaye hai
 Farmers expect a lot from soybean in the kharif crop
 lekin buaai ke baad dhoop na nikalne se beej paudhon kii shakl nahin le sake or uske saath-saath kisaanon kii ummiden bhi dafan ho gayi
 The crop standing on 20 acres of Babulal Patidar farmer of Misrod adjacent to Bhopal has deteriorated
 ve bataate hai, ''buaai karte hi itani barsaat hui ki soyabean ke saare beej sad gaye
 Now there will be no crop
 '' fasal ke barabaad hone se sirf kisaanon ko hi nahin, aam logon ko bhi nuksaan uthaanaa hoga kyonki isse khaadya tel mahangaa ho saktaa he

 ''kharaab or nakli bijon kii marpichley saal sitambar main kheton main khadi soyabean kii fasal par barish kii maar padi thi
 According to agricultural scientists, the germination capacity of seeds was destroyed up to 50 percent

 Director of Directorate of Soybean Research, Indore, Dr
 aar
 K
 shrivastav kehete hai, ''isiilie kisaanon ko salaah di gai thi ki ve bijon kii ankuran kshamta parakhkar hi istemaal karen
 "the state government had anticipated a reduction in the germination capacity of the seeds, which is why it allowed the use of seeds with 60% germination capacity while giving a relaxation in standardization
" ab tak yah maanak 70 fisadi hua karata tha
 Last year, the soybean crop was planted in 6 million hectares and the production was 82 lakh tonnes
 is baar krishi vibhaag ne iskaa rakabaa badhaakar 66 lakh ton kar diya tha
 This required 1
5 million quintal seeds and estimated to produce more than 10 million tonnes
 lekin buaai ke liye sirf 12 lakh quintal beej hi uplabdh ho sake
 Even a large part of it turned out to be bad
 isi kaa phayda uthaakar kuch companiyon ne gaiyr-maanak bijon ko bazaar main utaar diya
 The fake government does not reach the farmers so the state government gets them investigated
 is baar bhi 130 companiyon ke bijon ke namoonay kii jaanch karwaai gai thi jisamen se 33 companiyon ke namoonay hi maanak paae gaye

 # hatestoryiv aatankwaadiyon ko khoj nikaalane main maahir neshnal security guard (enesji) ke trend dogs kii najar se ab aatankwaadiyon kaa batch paanaa lagbhag naammumkin hoga
 Because the NSG now has the Melinois breed dogs used in the US operation against the notorious international terrorist Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, which has also been equipped with the k9 vision system
 vastav main enesji ke lierek9 vijan systamase las ye trend dogs kai safal abhiyaanon ko anjaam bhi de chuke hai
 With these trend dogs brought from France equipped with k9 vision system technology, the NSG has joined the elite commando forces of the world such as the Sheel commandos and Israeli commandos
 enesji ke manesar hub main aaj neshnal k9 seminar kaa aayojan kiya gaya, jisamen france se laae gaye in trend dogs ko pradarshit kiya gaya
 Under the k9 vision system, these trend dogs are goggled with a camera, with the help of which NSG commandos can see front and back views of the dogs
 iske jariye chhipe hue aatankwaadiyon ke live vijual liye ja sakate hai
 How the K9 Vision System Will Work The K9 Vision System is worn like a specimen on the head of a Belgian Melinois breed dog with the NSG
 is vijan system main dog ke aankh ke upar do camere or ek camera peeche laga hoga
 These trend dogs equipped with K9 vision system will continue to get the full video real time of the direction that their handler will send
 yahi nahin 500 gram ke is gogal numa vijan system main dog ke kaan main ek cordleys year phone bhi laga rahegaa
 With this ear phone, the dog will be able to change its location rapidly as per instructions received from its handler
 sabase khaas baat yah he ki aatanki agar ek jagah se duusari jagah bhaag rahaa ho to enesji ke dog handler commando dogs ke kaan main lage year phone ke jariye unhen aatankwaadi kaa peechha karne kaa nirdesh bhi de sakate hai
 NSG commandos will continue to receive real-time video even during the terrorist chase
 hai tech K9 dogs kii sankhya badhegienesji main is samay belgian melinois nasl ke kareeb do darjan dogs hai
 These Melinois dogs have become an integral part of the nsg's' Black Cat 'commandos' counter-terrorism operations
 enesji ke khoji kutton ke special daste 'ke 9' main kaam karne vaale force ke afasar ne kaha ki ye kute enesji ke oparation wing main kaaphi saalon se kaam kar rahe hai
 The special forces around the world have understood the importance of these dogs in the campaign against terrorism
 belgian melinois kism ke ye dogs bade sir or chaudee naak kii madad se bina koi galati kiye sandigdh manushyon, visphotakon or iidi kii gandh pahchaan sakate hai
 Another feature of these Melinois dogs is that they do not make barking gestures like other search dogs, which makes suspects to be alert
 enesji adhikariyon ke mutabiq commando ab tak aatankwaad ke khilaaf oparations main german shefrd or lebrador nasl ke kutton kii madad lete rahe hai
 But the inclusion of these dogs equipped with these K9 vision systems of the Melinois breed will give their special campaign a more edge
