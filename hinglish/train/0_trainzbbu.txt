 emsidi chunaav se pehle bijepi ne apane ghoshnaptr main saste bhojan kaa bhi vaada kiya tha
 But its closure in just a few months of starting the scheme is raising serious questions on the bjp's promise
 bijepi ne vaada kiya tha ki emsidi chunaav main jite to 10 rupee main garibon ko khaanaa khilaaenge
 On 25 December last year, on the birthday of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the South MCD started the Atal Janahar Yojana with a big push in his name
 lekin aaj kii taarikh main atal ji ke naam se shuru kii gai ye yojana south dilli main dam todatii nazar aa rahi he
 The Ataljanhar scheme launched by South MCD has now stopped
 kahin iske kendron ko band kar diya gaya he to kahin puraa kaa puraa khokha hi hataa liya gaya he
 Aajtak's team investigated this and proceeded to the Atal Janahar Yojana Center near AIIMS which was inaugurated by MP Meenakshi Lekhi from New Delhi himself
 yahaan aane ke baad pataa chalaa ki beete 1 maheene se ye band padaa hua he
 Actually, food was being given to people for only 10 rupees, which they used to take advantage of
 atal janaahaar yojana ke is centre main naukari karne waalon ne iske bare main bataaya ki iske khulne se sirf 10 rupee main khaanaa mil jaataa tha lekin ab paas ke dhabas par 40 rupee kii thali khaani pad rahi he
 The team then proceeded to the open Atal Janahar Yojana Center at Kakraula Mor near Dwarka
 yahaan pahunchane par pataa chalaa ki 25 disambar klytal bihari vaajapeyike naam par yojana ke liye kiyosk lagaaya gaya tha
 She is no longer in her place
 paas hi main chaay kii dukaan lagane vaale ramesh ne bataaya ki yahaan kiyosk kareeb maheene bhar pehle band ho gaya tha lekin kuch din pehle kiyosk hi uthaakar le gaye hai
 Talking to the MCD officials about the food cooking closed during the school holidays, he said on the condition of anonymity that in fact, in the kitchen making Mid Day Meal in South MCD schools for Atal Janahar Yojana, Heatal Janahar Yojana prepared food
 was going
 ab skulon main garmiyon kii chhuttiyaan hone ke chalate mid de mile bananaa band he isliye kichan band hone ke kaaran atal janaahaar yojana ke liye bhi khaanaa nahin ban rahaa he
 On the other hand, Leader of the South MCD, Kamaljeet Sehrawat, also admitted that the Rs 10 plate given under the scheme is currently closed
 lekin ise jald shuru kiya jayega or is babat kamishnar ko nirdesh de die hai
 However, the opposition has questioned the closure of such a much publicized scheme
 south emsidi main netaa vipaksh praveen kumaar ne kaha ki is yojana ko jaldbaaji main lagu karne ke chakkar me emsidi ne pehle thik se khaakaa taiyaar nahin kiya tha
 The scheme is operational in North MCD, although the plan may be in the south MCD, but the situation in North MCD is completely opposite
 jahaan ek taraf south emsidi main purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke naam par shuru kii gai yojana badahaal he, to vahiin north emsidi kii taraf se shuru kii gai "atal rasoi dinadayal aahaar yojana" abhi bhi hazaron logon kaa pet bhar rahi he
 That too for just 10 rupees
 uttari dilli ke shalimaar baag main is yojana ke tahat 10 rupee main sabji or 6 puri yaa kadi chaaval khaaya ja saktaa he, ravivaar ko halava nishulk diya jaataa he
 According to Sadan Tilakraj Kataria, leader in MCD, the thinking of service is behind the success of this scheme
 jisamen dharmarth pasand log apni ichha se yogadan dete hai
 So far, people are being given a plate in this scheme only through their donation
 yojana kii safalataa se gadgad north emsidi ab aane vaale dinon main sabhi 104 vaardon main atal rasoi dinadayal aahaar yojana ke kiyosk kholane par vichaar kar rahi he

 After this, his time often comes with 'bindi'

 Sir is in a hurry
 thik ek bajkar saat minute par aaye, gusalakhane main haath-munh dhoyaa, itane main mej par khaanaa aa jaataa he
 Finishing the meal in half an hour, Cigar Sulga sahib returns to his car
 lunch ke samay doli khaane ke kamare main nahin aati, alag khaati he
 When the evening returns from the mill at five and a half, they are careless
 us samay ve doli ko avashya yaad karte hai
 Five-seven minutes talk to her and then sit at tea for a long time talking to the maternal uncle
 mamaa dopaher yaa tisare pahar kahin baahar jaati he to thik paanch baje lautakar sahab ke liye car mil main bhej detii hai
 Doli prepares to call Bula Saheb

 After removing the black-white frock of the school uniform, the slight frock that is worn in the afternoon, the new frock is worn, the ribbon is tied in the hair
 sandals ke paalish tak par mamaa kii najar jaati he
 Bagga Saheb is the chief engineer in the mill
 vilaayat paas hai
 Get twelve hundred rupees a month
 jivan se santusht hai parantu apane uttardaayitv se bhi beparwaah nahin
 Only one girl is Dauli
 doli paanchaven varsh main he
 After that there were no children
 ek hi santaan ke prati apana kartavya puraa kar sakane se sahab or mamaa ko paryaapt santosh he
 In the eyes of Bagga Saheb, the ideal of responsibility towards children is high
 ve doli ko beti yaa betaa sabakuch samajhakar santosh kiye hai
 She will get university education
 iske baad shiksha-shram puraa karne ke liye uskaa vilaayat janaa bhi aavashyak or nishchit he
 How many children can this ideal of education responsibility towards children be fulfilled? Sahab says - what is the use of producing like insects and pests? Mama and Mrs
 Bagga also agree and what? 
 
 
 ! Dolly 
 
 
 ! Dolly 
 
 ! mamaa teen dafe pukaar chuki thim
 He called Aya for the fourth time
 koi uttar na paa ve khisiakar swayan baraamde main nikal aayin
 Now he himself had to change clothes
 dekha-bangale ke pichhawaade se; jahaan dhobi or mali ke quarter hai, aayaa doli ko pakade liye laa rahi he
 Mama saw it and was shocked
 ve samaj gayin- doli avashya mali ke ghar gayi hogi
 Malin had a child two or three days ago
 use god main lene ke liye doli kitni hi baar jidd kar chuki thi
 Mama was horrified when Doli went to the gardener's cell
 dhobi ke ladke ko pehle hi saptaah khasra niklaa tha
 If the girl had gone there, she would have eaten mulberry with those stupid children by picking them out of the dust under the mulberry tree
 unhen bhay tha, un bacchon ke saath doli kii aadaten bighad jane kaa
 Aya was frightened after experiencing the responsibility of all these crimes on himself
 mem sahab ke sammukh unki beti kii uchhrunkhalata se apni bebasii dikhaane ke liye vah doli se ek kadam aage, uski baanh thame yon liye aa rahi thi jaise svachhndata se pattee charne ke liye aatur bakrii ko, jabaran kaan pakad ghar kii ore laayaa jaataa he
 Even before the maternal uncle could say anything, Aya began to explain in a loud voice - "let us practice on sandil, we shall get inside
" hamase boleen ki ham gusalakhane jaayenge
 In this way, we have reached out to the gardener's house
 hamako to kuch ginati hi nahin
 If we explain then it kills us
 "is peshbandi ke baavjood aayaa ko daant padi
 "this is very silly!" Mama rebukes Doli in English
 angreji ke sabhi shabdon kaa arth na samaj kar bhi doli apana aparaadh or uske prati mamaa kii udignata samaj gayi
 Immediately after washing hands and mouth with soap, the clothes of the doli were changed
 chaar bajkar bees minute ho chuke the, isliye aayaa jaldi-jaldi doli ko mojey or sandal pahana rahi thi or mamaa swayan uske sir main kanghee kar uski laton ke pechon ko feete se band rahi thi, sneh se beti kii palkon ko sahalaate hue unhen achaanak gardan par kuch dikhaai diya- jo vajrapaat ho gaya
 It was definitely the result of the company of the children of Zu Mali and Dhobi
 aayaa par ek or dot padi or notice de di gayi ki yadi phir doli aawaara, gande bacchon ke saath khelti paayi gayi to bas barkhaast kar di jaayegi
 Seeing this plight of the daughter, the mother's heart melted
 angreji chhod ve dravit swar main apni hi boli main beti ko dulaar se samajhane lageen, "doli to pyaari beti he, badi hi sundar, badi hi laadli beti, ham is ko sundar-sundar kapade pahanaate hai
 Dolly, you go to school with the children of the British and not by sitting on the bus
 aise gande bacchon ke saath nahin khelte na!"machalakar farsh par paanv patake doli ne kaha- "mamaa, hamako mali kaa baccha le do, ham use pyaar karenge
 "uh, uh!" Mama explained, "what a dirty child he is! Playing with such dirty children can lead to shit
 inke saath khilne se juen pad jaati hai
 They are so dirty, black and black! Is our dolly black somewhere? Aya, take Douli to the manager to play
 vahaan yah raman or jyoti ke saath khel aayaa karegi
 Taking it to the company garden in the evening
 "doli ne maan ke gale main baahen daal vishwaas dilaayaa ki ab vah kabhi gande or chote logon ke kaale bacchon ke saath nahin khelegi
 Bagga saheb and Mrs Bagga continued to discuss that day that children do not know why children like to play with young children
 ek bachche ko hi thik se paal sakna mushkil he jane kaise log itane bacchon ko paalate hai
 Look at the gardener! Fucking has three children before, one more is done
 bagga sahab ke yahan ek kutiya vicitra nasl kii thi
 Paper-almond-like color, soft and long hair of silk on the neck and tail, sewn wide
 banhon kii kohniyaan baahar ko nikali hui! pet bilkul peeth se sata hua
 Sitting in the back with an injury like mouth
 ankhen gol-gol jaise upar se rakh di gayi hon
 The sight of newcomers would not remain without being attracted to him
 yahi kutiya kii upyogita or visheshta thi
 Two hundred and fifty rupees was the value of this hobby
 kute ne pille diye
 It was a great celebration for Doli
 vah kute ke pillon ke paas se hataanaa hi na chaahati thi
 There was no shortage of people asking for those puppy-eyed Mundi-eyed puppies, but whom should they give and whom should they deny? If you start distributing this breed like this, then what will be the value of it? The bitch would not have had the price for two hundred and fifty rupees for her milk! It was the law of the sir, if the dogs gave puppies, they would have told the scavenger to dive into the hot water and get them killed
 is dafe bhi ve yahi karnaa chaahate the parantu doli ke kaaran pareshaan the
 After all, Barre got the scavenger working when he went to school
 skool se laut doli ne pillon kii khoj shuru kii
 Aya said, "the puppies have been sent to the manager to show Raman, he will come in the evening
 "mamaa ne kaha- "baby, pille so rahe hai
 When you get up, take a game from them
 "doli pillon ko khojati hi phiri
 After all, he came to know from the scavenger that he had been killed by dipping in hot water
 doli ro-rokar behaal ho rahi thi
 Aya took the company to the garden to call him
 doli baar-baar puch rahi thi- "aayaa, pillon ko garam pani main dubokar kyon maar diya?"aayaa ne samajhaayaa-"danni (kutiya) itane bacchon ko doodh kaise pilaati? ve bhukh se cheu-cheu kar rahe the isliye unhen marava diya
 "danny has weeds for puppies for two days and you forgot them, like Douli again and others
 mali ke naye bachche ke rone kii ken-ken aawaaj aadhi raat main, dopaher main, subah-shaam kisi bhi samay aane lagati
 Mrs Bagga felt bad about it
 jhallaakar ve kah baithti- "jane is bachche ke gale kaa chhed kitna bada he
 "they would feel worse about the child when Dowley started asking," Mama, why is the gardener's baby crying? "bindi said while sitting near-" Will you cry or not, mother's milk does not come out
 "mamaa or bindi ko dhyaan nahin tha ki doli unki baat sun rahi he
 Doli said - "mama, put the gardener's child in hot water with a scavenger, then you will not cry
" "bindi ne hanskar dhoti kaa anchal honton par rakh liya
 Uncle was shocked
 doli apni bholi, saral aankhon main samarthan kii aashaa liye unki ore dekh rahi thi
 "this is very silly douli, sometimes it is said for man's child!" Mama solemnly explained
 paristhiti dekh aayaa doli ko baahar ghumaane le gayi
 On the third day at dusk, Dauli was returning to the manager, playing with Raman and Jyoti
 bangale ke daravaaje par mali apane naye bachche ko kore kapade main lapete donon haathon par liye baahar jaataa dikhaayi diya
 Malin kept crying after him
 aayaa ne mare bachche kii parchaai padane ke dar se use ek ore kar liya
 Douli asked- "what is this? Aya, what is the gardener carrying?" "the gardener's little child is dead," slowly-aya replied and led Douli from the middle to the tham bungalow
 doli ne apni bholi, neeli ankhen aayaa ke mukh par gadaakar poocha, "aayaa, mali ke bachche ko kya garam pani main dubo diya?""chhi: doli, aisi baaten nahin kehete!" aayaa ne dhamkaaya, "aadmi ke bachche ko aise thode hi maarthe hai!"doli kaa vismay shant na hua
 Turning to look away at the gardener, he again asked- "so how does a man's child die?" Aya while dragging him inside the bungalow to divert the attention of the girl replied, "he died, starving
" has died
 chalo mamaa bula rahi hai
 "dowley did not shut up, he asked again-" Aaya, shall we die of hunger too? "" Shut up Dowli! " His heart melted
 uski dhundharali laton ko haath se sahalaate hue aayaa kehane lagi- "bairi kii aankh main rai-non! hai meri miss sahab, tum aise aadmi thode hi ho!"bhukh se marate hai kamine aadamiyon ke bachche! "kehete-kehete aayaa kaa galaa rundh gaya
 He remembered his son, two years ago! Since then, she was working with the officer

 The court has issued summons to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the coal block allocation case
 adaalat kaa maananaa he ki manmohan singh odisha ke talawira 2 or 3 kol block main hindaalako ko 15 fisadi kii hissedari dene main apni jimmevary se batch nahin sakate kyonki pradhanmantri hone ke saath-saath wo us vakt koyala mantri bhi the
 But at this time, the Congress party has given full consideration to Manmohan Singh
 party ke ek varisht netaa kii maane to sonia gandhi manmohan singh kaa bachaav antim samay tak karengi kyonki ve narsimha raav nahin hai
 Two senior ministers of the NDA government also said that they believe that Manmohan Singh is honest and he has sympathy for Manmohan Singh
 congress kaa maananaa he ki manmohan singh kii imaanadaaree, nishpakshta or paardarshita jagajaahir he, yah puraa desh jaanata he
 The Congress says that the CBI has investigated the matter and found the investigation to be fair and transparent
 manmohan singh bhi jaanch ke paksh main hameshaa se rahaa he
 The Congress says that Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, where the BJP government was opposed, when the process of auction of coal blocks was started in the Manmohan Singh government
 yahi nahin odisha or bengal kii sarkaar ne bhi chitthee likh kar apana virodh jataayaa
 But everyone was persuaded and the government introduced a bill to change the coal allocation law in February 2012
 congress manmohan singh maamle main ekajute he or vipaksh bhi manmohan singh par hamale nahin kar rahaa balki congress par hamale kar rahaa he
 The problem with the government is that along with Manmohan Singh, the court has also sent summons to big industrialist Kumaramangalam Birla
 ye sarkaar kabhi nahin chaahegi ki upie kii tarah unke raaj main bhi udyogpati kisi maamle main jail jaaen, isse sarkaar kii chhavi par asar padegaa
 This will be a matter of dilemma for the Finance Minister
 magar sabase bada sawaal ye he ki congress jisane narsimha raav ko jeemem maamle main akelaa chhod diya tha or unhen ye puraa maamla khud hi ladanaa padaa tha
 Narasimha Rao had to make many rounds of court and at that time only a few leaders in the Congress were in contact with Rao
 isaki vajah narsimha raav or 10 janpath ke bich badhati duuri thi
 It is said that the two did not like each other
 sonia gandhi sakriy raajnneeti main thi nahin or unako jo kuch bhi bataaya jaataa tha usase raav or sonia gandhi ke bich khai badhati hi gai
 Then Sitaram Kesari was made the President of the Congress and Kesari was replaced by Sonia Gandhi
 ab halaat alag hai
 Sonia Gandhi has always defended Manmohan Singh in the last ten years
 2009 main pehali baar samvaadadaata sammelan main manmohan singh ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaaya, yah congress parampara ke khilaaf tha
 When the government was to be formed with the mufti in Jammu and Kashmir in 2002, it was Manmohan Singh who was sent to Srinagar
 jab ensipi ko upie main shaamil kiya ja rahaa tha tab bhi manmohan singh ko hi sharad pavaar ke paas sania ne bheja tha or khud baad main gai thim
 That is, Sonia Gandhi used Manmohan Singh's honesty and instinctive nature to make a mark on the party
 yahi vajah he ki sonia gandhi manmohan singh ko chhod nahin sakati magar jaisaa ki ek congress ke netaa ne kaha madam kaa to thik he magar rahul kaa kuch nahin kah sakate

 Rohit of the Dalit community along with his four other associates was evicted from the hostel a few days ago
 aatmahatya se pehle rohit vemula ne ek patr choda he, jisamen unhone likhaa he:good morning,aap jab ye patr pard rahe honge tab main nahin hounga
 Don't be angry with me main jaanata hum ki aap main se kai logon ko meri parvaah thi, aap log mujhase pyaar karte the or aapane meraa bahut khyaal bhi rakhaa
 i have no complaints with anyone
 mujhe hameshaa se khud se hi samasya rahi he
 i feel the gap between my soul and my body growing
 main ek daanav ban gaya hum
 And i was overwhelmed
 main to hameshaa lekhak bananaa chahta tha
 Like Carl Sagan, the writer of science and eventually i am able to write just this one letter
 
 
 maine vigyaan, taron or prakruti se prem kiya, phir maine logon ko chaha, yah jane bagaiyr ki log jane kab se prakruti se dur ho chuke
 Our feelings have become fake, our love has a texture
 hamaare vishwaason main duraagrah he
 At this moment i am not hurt, not even sad, just oblivious to myself
 ek insaan kii keemat, uski pahchaan ek vot


 ek sankhya


 ek vastu tak simat kar rah gai he
 Whatever field, in study, in politics, in dying, in living, never a person was judged by his intelligence
 is tarah kaa khat main pehali dfa likh rahaa hum
 This is my first experience of writing the last letter
 agar yah kadam sarthak na ho paae to mujhe maaf kijiega
 Maybe in understanding this world, love, pain, life and death, i was wrong
 koi jaldi nahin thi, lekin main hameshaa jaldbaaji main rahata tha
 Was in a hurry to start a life
 isi kshan main, kuch logon ke liye jindagi abhishaap he
 My birth is a fatal accident for me
 apane bachapan ke akelepan se main kabhi ubar nahin sakaa
 a little child of the past
 is vakt main aahat nahin hum


 dukhi nahin hum, main bas khaali ho gaya hum
 Regardless of yourself too
 yah dukhad he or isi vajah se main aisa kar rahaa hum
 People can call me a coward and when i am gone i can think of them as selfish, or even stupid
 mujhe koi fark nahin padataa ki mujhe kya kaha ja rahaa he
 i do not believe in stories, ghosts or spirits after death
 agar kisi baat par main vishwaas karata hum to vah yah he ki main ab sitaron tak kaa safar kar saktaa hum
 And i can know about the other world
 jo bhi is khat ko pard rahe hai, agar aap mere liye kuch kar sakate hai, to mujhe saat maheene kii fellowship milani baaki he jo ek lakh or 75 hajaar rupee he, kripaya ye koshish karen ki vah mere parivaar ko mil jaae
 i have to give 40 thousand rupees to Ramji
 usne kabhi in paison ko mujhase nahin maanga, magar krupa karke ye paise use de die jaaen
 Let my last journey be peaceful and comfortable
 aisa vyavhaar karen ki lage jaise main aayaa or chalaa gaya
 Don't shed tears for me yah samaj len ki jinda rahane kii bajaay main marane se khush hum
 'from shadows to stars' Uma Anna, i am sorry that i am using your room to do this
 eyese (ambedkar students esoshiation) parivaar ke liye, maaf karnaa main aap sabko niraash kar rahaa hum
 You loved me very much main ujjwal bhavishya ke liye dher sari shubhakamanaayen de rahaa hum
 Finally, for the time, Jai Bhima forgot to complete the formalities
 meri khudakushi ke liye koi jimmedaar nahin he
 No one has encouraged me to do so, neither by his words nor his work
 yah meraa faisla he or main akelaa vyakti hum, jo is sabake liye jimmedaar he
 Please do not disturb my friends and enemies after i leave

 uttar pradesh ke mughalsarai jankshan kaa naam aaj se badal jayega
 This historic railway station will now be known as Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay
 gadar ke baad 1862 main purvi bharat ke duusare sabase bade railway stesan kaa naam mughalsarai jankshan padaa, yani yah 156 saal purana he, ise puure purvi bharat kaa railway kaa dwaar mana jaataa tha
 But today this name will end completely and Deendayal Upadhyay, who is considered the ideological proponent of BJP, will now be known in his name
 pehle bhi hui thi naam badalane kii koshish1992 main bhi mughalsarai jankshan kaa naam badalane kii koshish kii gai thi lekin centre kii congress sarkaar ne tab ise maanane se manaa kar diya tha
 Kalyan Singh's first Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh tried to change its name in 1992
 is baar BJP ke pradesh adhyaksh or chandauli se saansad mahendra pandey ne yah prastaav centre sarkaar ko bheja tha jiske baad BJP ne apni is puraani maang ko paravaan chadhaaya
 Hence the demand for change in name was the mysterious death of Jan Sangh founder Deendayal Upadhyaya on 11 February 1968 at Mughalsarai Junction and his body was found near the pillar number 1276 of the yard of Mughalsarai Junction, after which the supporters of Mughalsarai Junction Union and BJP It had become like a pilgrimage and it had been demanding for a long time that Mughalsarai Junction be named after Deendayal Upadhyay

 Different response received after name change: The name of Mughalsarai Junction is also favorable to BJP because it was named after Mughals
 mughalkaal main yah mughal raajaaon kaa sarai hua karata tha, jahaan wo aate jate apana padaav daalate the
 By changing the name, the BJP is writing the name of its founder at the gate of eastern India on one side, while on the other side it is also erasing the Mughal name on the pretext and it is also part of the bjp's politics

 In fact, Gehlot had asked the question whether the government will close Vyapam? To this, Kamal Nath replied that at present there is no such proposal under consideration in the General Administration Department '
 sirf yahi nahin sawaal ke bindu (ga) main vidhayak harsh vijay gahalot ne poocha ki 'kya vyaapman ko vittiya adhikaar praapt nahin he? kya use fees tay karne kaa bhi adhikaar praapt nahin he? or agar aisa he to kya ye berozegaron ke saath chhalaava nahin he? is sawaal ke jawaab main mukhyamantri ne kaha ki vyaapman ko pariksha shulk tay karne kaa adhikaar he isliye yah kahana sahi nahin he ki berozegaron ke saath kisi prakaar kaa chhalaava kiya jaataa he
 The promise was to close Vyapam
 At the end of the last year, before the Assembly elections, the Congress had promised in its promissory note that the examination fees of those who were not selected in the examinations taken by Vyapam from 2008 to 2018 will be refunded and Vyapam Will be closed while on Wednesday, contrary to the promissory note, answers have been given, so that the Congress can once again come under the scanner

 It should not be either

 Rajput society respects every woman

 Deepika is an actress
 hamaari ladaai kisi se nahin
 But we do not want any film to be made on Rani Padmavati
 unhen nrity karte dikhaaya jaae
 If the cinema burns then the Center is responsible
 Some people also said that if the film is released and the cinema burns in protest, then it will be the responsibility of the central government and the state government
 ravivaar ko is milan samaaroh main puure rajput samaaj ke saamne ye sawaal rakhaa gaya ki aakhir padmavati ko relies hone dena he yaa nahin

 Even after this, if Modi's popularity in the survey of channels is touching the scale of 60 and 70 in 100, it means that people are really happy with this government after losing their income

 Sadly, nothing about it appears in Hindi newspapers whose journalists and editors come from villages

 Every plea of the government was rejected at the Reserve Bank meeting
 iske baad bhi kaha jaataa he ki notebandi ko lekar reserve bank sahamat tha
 You can tell such lies only if your popularity is 60 percent according to the channels
 yahi nahin notebandi ke samay aadesh hua tha ki puraane 500 or 1000 ke note petrol pump, hawaii adde, railway stesan par istamaal honge
 There is no record of how much money came into the system through it, whether black money was made white through it
 artiai se puche gaye prashn ke uttar main bhartiya reserve bank ne yahi kaha he ki iskaa ricard nahin he
 You know what petrol pumps are

 input language input- bhashaa Many times, after a statement, the situation becomes such that it is not easy to handle, a statement made by Union Minister of State for Human Resource Satyapal
 sarkaar kii aalochana ke baad ab unke senior mantri ne sthiti sanbhaalane kii koshish kii or unase safai dene ko kaha he
 Modi's minister Satyapal Singh said, the whole country should be saffronised
 After the ongoing criticism, Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar clarified that he instructed his junior minister Satyapal Singh to improve his statement on Darwin's development principles
 is
 unhone kaha ki hamen vigyaan ko kamatar nahin aankna chahie
 During a program in Aurangabad last week, Satyapal, Minister of State for Human Resource Satyapal, termed Darwin's development theory as scientifically incorrect and said that schools and colleges should change their curriculum
 haalanki unke is bayaan ke baad 2,000 se zyada vaigyanikon ne isaki kadi ninda kii or rajya mantri ke daawey ko galat bataaya
 However, now Javadekar made it clear that no seminar would be held to prove Darwin wrong
 purv ipies or rajya mantri satyapal ne akhil bhartiya vaidic sammelan main bhaag lene ke baad patrakaron se baatcheet main kaha tha ki darwin kaa siddhant (manushya kaa kramik vikaas) vaigyanik drushti se galat he
 It should be changed in school and college curriculum
 manushya ko jab se dharti par dekha gaya vah manushya hi tha
 He went on to say, "nobody, including our ancestors, wrote or verbally said that they saw a monkey turning into a human
 hamane jo bhi kitaaben padhi hai yaa daadi-nani dwaara hamen sunai gai kahaniyon main kahin bhi iskaa zikr nahin miltaa he
 "the scientific community reacted sharply to the statement of the Rajya Mantri by the scientific world and strongly criticized it
 bharat kii teen vigyaan acadamiyonke vaigyanikon ne bayaan jari kar kaha ki mantri ke bayaan kaa koi bhi vaigyanik aadhaar nahin he
 a statement issued by the scientists said, "the principle of gradual development through which Darwin made extremely impressive contributions is universally accepted
 kramik vikaas ke mul tathyon main kisi tarah kaa vaigyanik vivaad nahin he
 It is a scientific theory that made many predictions, which have been confirmed through repeated experiments and observations
 "HRD mantri ne safai dene ko kahaek mantri kii ore se is tarah ke bayaan ke baad unki party bhartiya janata party or sarkaar ko sharmasaar hona padaa
 He was finding it difficult to defend his minister
 is bayaan ke baad soshal media or media main tikhi pratikriya ko dekhte hue party ke sheersh str par turant safai kii zarurat mahasoos kii jane lagi
 However, sources reveal that instead of cleaning on behalf of the party, senior Union Minister Prakash Javadekar was asked to handle this situation
 party ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha, "sabhi junior galati karte hai to senior mantri unhen salaah dete hai
 Prakash Javadekar also did the same and asked Satyapal to clear his position in the media
 "duusari ore, javdekar ne bhi kaha, "maine is maamle par unase baat kii he or unase kaha he ki is vishay par apana bayaan jari karen
 i have also advised that we should not underestimate science

 Shah Rukh Khan's craze started in 1992 with 'deewana'
 aaj bhi ye barkaraar he
 But for the past few years, Shah Rukh has been disappointing his fans
 aakhir shahrukh ke saath aisa kya ho rahaa he jo industry main unki kursi hilaa rahaa he
 
 
 Shahrukh Khan is called the 'king of Romance' in the industry
 lekin badhati umr ke saath beshak vah yah tag zyada samay tak nahin chalaa sakate the
 Had to do experiment
 so 'badshaah khan' ne bhi kiya
 To entice the audience, he became a superhero, coach of the hockey team, tried soft action and thriller as well
 lekin baat bani nahin
 Shah Rukh Khan of 'chak De India', which came in 2007, is confused about his career
 is film main vah mahila hockey team ke coach bane the
 There was no heroine with him in this
 sports filmon ko phir se parde par jinda karne vaali is film ke baad se shahrukh apane kariyar main jaan nahin phoonk sake
 i wish Shahrukh was in these films
 
 
 25 filmon main kitni hai hit'chak de india' lekar 2016 main ai letest film 'i dil he mushkil' tak unka naam kareeb 25 filmon se judaa he
 More than half of them have cameos or they are associated with it as producers
 is aadhaar parshahrukh khanhar saal do filmein kar rahe hai lekin bahut jor daalane par bhi unki badi hit film kaa naam yaad nahin aata
 However, in 2007, he gave big hits like 'om Shanti Om'
 2008 main 'rab ne bana di jodi', 2010 main 'maay nem ij khan', 2011 main 'raa
 One 'and' Don 2 ',' Jab Tak Hai Jaan 'in 2012,' Chennai Express' in 2013, 'happy New Year' in 2014, 'dilwale' in 2015 and 'fan' in 2016
 
 
 hit filmon or box offis par banate record main inamen se bas 'hapi new year' hi list main najar aati he
 And one of the major reasons for the movies which are not playing is their weak script
 shahrukh ke namaur filmon ke jabardast prachaar (jisamen king khan vaaki export hai) ke chalate pehle veekend to collection thik mil jaati he
 But after this, films start sitting
 or beshak ye shahrukh ke liye ek badi chunauti he
 The weak trio of Khan trio has dominated the Khan trio for the last two decades in Bollywood
 aise main agar shahrukh kii tulanasalamanaur aamir se karen to tasviir saaf ho jaati he ki unki 'badshahath' khatre main he
 Salman Khan has become the star of mass level
 unki har film kamai kaa ek nayaa record banaati he
 Whether it is a single screen or multiplex, viewers of both levels reach to watch their films
 shahrukh se judi ye 10 khaas baaten kya pataa hai aapako
 
 
 At the same time, Aamir already does selected films and people are immediately moved on what he does
 usamen antertenment or soshal apil itani hoti he ki vah bhi har class ko lubhaa lete hai
 But script is also a major reason for the success of films like 'dabangg', 'sultan', 'bajrangi Bhaijaan', 'PK'
 agar ye nahin hoti, salmaan or aamir ko aise safalataa bhi nahin milti
 At the same time, it has not been easy for Shahrukh to break his romantic image and move forward
 'rab ne bana di jodi' or 'jab tak he jaan' ke baad unhone ection role main aane ke lierohit shettike saath 'chennai express' banaai
 But the way Rohit handled Ajay Devgan's career by flying vehicles, he did not go with Magic Shahrukh
 best friend farah ke liye 'hapi new year' kii or film ne saxes record banaae
 But the script was heavily criticized
 jeeyo se pehle aar kya-kya bech chuke hai shahrukh khan
 
 
 Shah Rukh then joined Kajol to take up a career last year, 'dilwale' Laker and then a weak story dug his boat
 is saal ai 'fain' main unke abhinay kii charchaa hui lekin saxes nahin mili
 In this way, continuously weak films have raised doubts in the minds of viewers that their films will not be as strong as before
 
 
 kya ye filmein badalengi tasvirphilhal unka daanv november main aane vaali'dear jindagi'or phir 'rais' par laga he
 If the story of 'dear Zindagi' is not clear yet, due to the presence of Pakistani actress Mahira Khan in 'raees', controversy could also arise
 aise main agar ek bhi film kamjor nikali to shahrukh khan ke staradam ko bhale hi kuch na ho lekin box offis par unki badshahath khatm ho jaaegi

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal jo ek din pehle tak shakurabsti kii ghatana par maanviyata kaa hawala de rahe the, aaj raajnneetik pratispardhaa main majaakudane par utar aae hai
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Monday took care of the victims and when they questioned the Aam Aadmi Party government, Kejriwal called them 'children'
 shakurabsti main jhuggi giraae jane or bacchee kii dukhad maut par jahaan ek ore jamkar siyasat ho rahi he
 a day after the devastated ashes and the painful death of the innocent, when the morning woke up on Monday, the rays of the morning brought new politics and compassion

 The crowd surrounded him and he said something to which he did not have authority
 congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha ki vah har jhuggi ko tuutane se rokenge
 Rahul did not stop here, he even said that those who are homeless can come and live in his house
 rahul ne maamle main centre or kejariwal sarkaar donon ko lapet liya
 But before Rahul Gandhi could say anything further on the Kejriwal government, a tweet by Chief Minister Kejriwal raised questions on Rahul's abilities
 rahul gandhi ji abhi bachche hai
 His party may not have told him that the railway falls under the central government and not the Delhi government

 baad main shefali ko big bos ne dand sunaate hue family letters bina padhe khud nasht karne ko kaha
 What did Siddharth Shukla say on Rashmi Desai? In this task Rashmi Desai destroyed the letter of Shahnaz Gill, which Siddharth Shukla probably did not like at all

 NDA seats have been divided for Bihar assembly elections
 chaaron ghatak dalon main aam sahmati ban gai he
 The BJP has retained 160 seats for itself, while former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has had to settle for 20 seats
 LJP 40 or RLSP 23 siton par chunaav ladegi
 Know what the NDA has done by keeping this in mind
 1
 The BJP had last won 91 out of 102 seats
 vahiin, loksabhaa chunaav main bhi 30 main 22 siton par kabja kiya tha
 This time, the main constituent is the party, so kept the maximum seats for themselves
 2
 Last time there was only BJP and JDU in NDA
 par abaki baar chaar partiyaan hai
 LJP contested 75 seats last time and won only 3 seats
 isliye use 40 par santosh karnaa padaa
 3
 sabase zyada charchamanjhi kii hamko 20 siten dene kii he
 Through Manjhi, the BJP will dent the vote bank of Nitish Kumar's Dalits, which is around six per cent in Bihar
 4
 Upendra Kushwaha's RLSP fought three seats with the NDA in the Lok Sabha and won all three
 kushvaha koiri samudaay se hai, jo bihar main kareeb 4 fisadi he auranitishaka samarthak rahaa he
 5
 aam chunaav main JDU, RJD, congress or NCP kaa sanyukt vot share 46 fisadi tha
 While BJP, LJP and RLSP vote share of 39 percent
 mahagathbandhan se saat fisadi kam
 That is, the nda's strategy is to breach that 7 percent vote share

 In the field of physics it is very important to know the simple periodic motion because a body is understood with the help of simple periodic motion
 saral aavartt gati (simple harmonic motion):1
 Periodic motion: When an object moving on a certain path repeatedly repeats its former motion after a certain time-interval, this type of motion is called the periodic motion
 2
 Oscillatory motion: The movement of a body in equilibrium is called oscillatory motion or vibratory motion
 dolan kise kehete hai-(i) dolan-ek dolan yaa ek kapann: dolan karne vaale kan kaa apni samya sthiti ke ek ore janaa phir samya sthiti main aakar duusari ore janaa or punah samya sthiti main waapas lautnaa, ek dolan yaa kapann kehalaata he
 (ii) Time period: The time to complete an oscillation is called the periodic period
 3
 Frequency: The amount of vibration that an object vibrates in a second is called its frequency
 iskaa S
 I
 maatrak hertz(hertz) hota he
 If frequency n and periodic period are T, then n = 1 / T
 (i) saral aavart gati (simple harmonic motion):yadi koi vastu ek sarak rekha paramadhyamaan sthiti (mean position) ke idhar-udhar is prakaar kii gati kare ki vastu kaa twaran madhyamaan sthiti se vastu ke visthaapan ke anukramanupati ho tathaa twaran kii disha madhyamaan sthiti kii ore ho, to uske gati saral aavart kehalaati he
 Characteristics of simple periodic motion: (i) No force acts on it
 (ii)uskaa twaran shunya hota he
 (iii) The velocity is maximum
 (iv)gatij urja adhiktam hoti he
 (v) potential energy is zero
 4
 When a particle performing simple periodic motion passes through the endpoints of its motion, (i) its acceleration is maximum
 (ii) us par kaary karne vaala pratyanayan bal adhiktam hota he
 (iii) The kinetic energy is zero
 (iv) sthitij urja adhiktam hoti he
 (v) The velocity is zero
 5
 Simple pendulum: This adjustment is called a 'simple pendulum' if a weightless and lengthless dolly head hangs a round but heavy particle of material and hangs it with a firm base
 yadi lolak (bob) ko samya sthiti se thodaa visthapit karke chhod de to isaki gati saral aavart gati hoti he
 If the chord has effective length l and gravitational acceleration g, t is simple 6
 lolak kaa aavart kaaryyath = 2π √l / g hota he
 This leads to the following conclusions: (i) t ∝ √l, ie t will increase as length increases
 yahi kaaran he ki yadi koi ladki jhul jhulate -jhulate khadi ho jaae to uskaa gurutv centre upar uth jaayegaa or prabhavi lambaai ghat jaaegi jisase jhule kaa aavart kaal ghat jayega
 That is, the swing will oscillate quickly
 (ii)aavartkaal lolak ke dravyaman par nirbhar nahin karata he, atah jhulane vaali ladki kii ladki aakar baith jaae to aavartkaal par koi prabhaav nahin padegaa
 (iii) t = √l / g i
e
 when a pendulum clock is moved up or down from the ground plane, the clock time (T) increases, that is, the clock becomes sluggish because 'g' is above or below the ground level
 The value of 'is less
 (iv)yadi lolak ko upgrah par le jaaen to vahaan bharaheenta ke kaaran g = 0, atah ghadi kaa aavartkaal (T) anant hi jayega; atah upgrah main lolak ghadi kaam nahin karegi
 7
 garmiyon main lolak kii lambaai (l) bad jaaegi to uskaa aavartkaal (T) bhi bad jayega
 Hence the clock will slow down
 sardiyon main lambaai (l) kam ho jane par aavartkaal (T) bhi bad jayega or lolak ghadi tej chalane lagegi
 8
 chandramaa par lolak ghadi le jane par uskaa aavartkaal bad jayega, kyonki chandramaa par g kaa maan prithvi ke g ke maan kaa 1 / 6 guna he

 dekhen puraa videoh Actor-director Manoj Kumar, who has made many films on patriotism, is remembered as the greatest patriotic artist
 1965 main ai film shahid main manoj kumaar ne bhagat singh kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa tha
 Manoj Kumar met the mother of shaheed-e-azam Bhagat Singh to bring this character closer to reality
 is baat kaa zikr manoj kumaar ne saal 2002 main apane ek lekh main kiya tha
 In his article Manoj Kumar wrote, "when i was making a film on Bhagat Singh i collected a lot of material
 lekin har cheez ko film main istemaal kiya janaa sambhav nahin tha
 The length of the film was hampered by this
 " unhone bataaya, "hamane film kii mekking ke dauraan chandigarh main bhagat singh kii maa or unke bhaaiyon se mulaakaat kii
 His mother was then admitted to the hospital
 keval or main unase milane gaye the
 At the same time, we also met Batukeshwar Dutt (bhagat Singh's brother)

 Binny said that i give the ten-day deferment to the Kejriwal government
 yadi in das dinon main nitiyaan nahin lagu huin to aisa karne par main dobaaraa baadhya ho jaaoongaa
 Binny was sitting on a protest against the Kejriwal government at Jantar Mantar from today itself
 iske pehle unhone kaha ki 'aap' kii sarkaar janata se kiye gaye vaade puri nahin kar sakati, isliye chaahati he ki kisi tarah sarkaar gir jaae
 However, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal responded to Binny saying that no government did as much work as this government did in a month

 After meeting LG, he said, 'I am sitting on a dharna
 main dilli kii janata ke muddon ke liye laduunga'
 According to Binny, he spoke to LG on the issue of Somnath Bharti
 mahilaon ke saath chhedchhad ke masale par alji ne kaha ki kanoon sabake liye sakht rahegaa
 LG has given the assurance to take action on what has been happening in Delhi for the last few days
 haalanki, binni ne yah bhi kaha ki alji ne unhen jo salaah di he, us bare main anshan ke manch se hi khulaasa karenge
 Binny appealed to the people to support his fast
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki kejariwal sarkaar apane vaadon ko bhul gai he
 People have been cheated
 binni ne kaha, 'main dilli ke logon kii aawaaj uthaa rahaa hum
 i will not allow the Aam Aadmi Party to run like this except for the issue of public interest
 ' unhone kaha ki abhi tak na kisi ke bijli ke bill maaf hue hai or na daam hi kam hue hai, isiilie ab log unase naaraaz hai
 There are 25 teams across Delhi, appealing to the people to support them
 binni ne kaha, 'log mere saath hai
 Those who have been cheated will support me in my fast

 After Binny was expelled from the party, senior party leader Yogendra Yadav tweeted that Binny felt bad about being fired, but Binny had left no other option
 algaavvaadi sanghathan hurriyat conference ke kattarpanthi dhade ke pramukh saiyad ali shah gilaani ne daawa kiya ki bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne unke or jammu-kashmir main algaavvaadi netritv ke paas apane doot bheje the evam kashmir mudde ke hal ko lekar apni patibaddhta jaahir karne kii peshkash kii thi, taaki algaavvaadi sanghathan unke prati naram rukh apanaaen
 However, Geelani said that he had no hope from Modi to develop a 'soft' policy on Jammu and Kashmir and refused to accept his offer
 vahiin bijepi ne is baat kaa khandan kiya ki modi ne kashmir ke gilaani se milane ke liye kisi doot ko bheja he
 Rejecting such claims of Gilani as mischievous and baseless, the party said in a statement that no envoy had attempted to meet or met Gilani to discuss the Kashmir issue
 bayaan main kaha gaya he ki bijepi kaa yah rukh ki jammu-kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he, bahut spasht he or isamen vichaar-vimarsh kii koi gunjaaish nahin he
 Earlier, at his Hyderpura residence, Gilani said, Modi has started a campaign and is contacting people here

 Led by the likes of Lucas Podolski and Miroslav Klose, Germany displayed a strong example of their pace and movement, winning their campaign in the 19th World Cup football tournament with a 4–0 imperial victory over Australia playing on Sunday with 10 players
 Started germany kii is bemisaal jeet main podolski or close ke alaava thomas mular, captain philip lam or yuva plamekar mesut ojil kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 Lucas Podolski (eighth minute), Miroslav Klose (26th minute), Thomas Muller (68th) and Kakau (70th minute) scored from his side
 austrailia anbhavi tim kahil ko red card milane se antim 32 minute das khilaadiyon ke saath khelaa
 From the very beginning, the match played at Mozes Mabida Stadium showed full enthusiasm, speed and an urge to dominate each other, but there was no response to the German movement, which soon dominated the match and in such a way Australia's defense Also failed to do
 lam, ojil or mular ko austrailia ke anbhavi rakshakon scot chiprafield or craig moore ko chakaane main adhik mashkkat nahin kerani padi jisase podolski aathven minute main gol dagkar apni team ko badhat dilaane main safal rahe
 Just before that, Klose's shot from 18 yards was intercepted by Schwarzer, but the eagerness to score was named after the 11th goal of the World Cup in the 26th minute
 close 23wein or 24wein minute main gol karne se chuke the lekin iske do minute baad unhen aakhir main tab safalataa mili jab lam kaa daayin taraf se liya gaya cross laharaata hua shwarger ko chhakaakar close ke paas pahunchaa or unhone use header se jaali main uljhane main der nahin lagaayi
 With this goal, Klose has come second in the European Cup with the most goals scored in the World Cup
 unhone hamawatan jargen clisamen kii barabari kii or ab mahaan footballer gard mular (14) se vah keval teen gol peeche hai
 If Klaus, who scored five goals in the last two World Cups, also shows the same feat in South Africa, he will match Brazil's Ronaldo's world record of 15 goals
 close ke is ricard gol ke paanch minute baad hi germany kaa score 3-0 ho saktaa tha lekin tab lucas nil ne golline se kuch inch pehle gol hone se roak diya
 Clos then had a great move towards young midfielder Ozil
 unhone golkeeper ko to chaka diya lekin nil thik samay par bachaav ke liye aa gayi
 The Australian team attacked in the fourth minute itself
 kahil ke carnor kik par lagaaye gayi header ko gol line par lam ne roka jabaki ribound par richard garsia kaa shaat german golkeeper minial neyur ne roak diya
 Then in the 20th minute, Jason Kulina, playing his 50th match, had a header out
 austrailia kii dikkatein duusare half main bad gayi
 His most prolific player, Cahill, knocked down Bastin Schwenstiger in the 58th minute on which Mexico referee Marco Rodrigues did not delay sending him out with a red card
 germany ne iskaa puraa phayda uthaakar do or gol daag diye
 When German coach Joakim Low recalled Podolski, Klose and Ozil, Australia made a few last-minute strikes
 is bich, 84wein minute main chiprafield ke cross par nikita rukavitsya santvanaa gol kar sakate the lekin neyur ne unki yah koshish bhi naakaam kar di
 Germany will now play their next match in Serbia from Serbia on 18 June, while Australia will take on Ghana on 19 June in Rustenburg, who beat Serbia 1–0 in the first match

 a political struggle is going on against Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 is baar do alag-alag khemon se hamalaa hua he
 Union Communications Minister Kapil Sibal and Press Council President Markandey Katju have targeted Modi
 ek kehete hai ki modi galat bolte hai or duusare kehete hai ki modi bolte nahin hai
 Even if Modi says a ruckus, if he does not say a ruckus
 jane desh kii siyasat main ye kya ho gaya he ki chaahe-anachaahe narendra modi hi uski centre main rahane lage hai
 The Congress, which always makes a ruckus on the statements of Narendra Modi, is angry today that Modi does not speak anything
 kendriya sanchaar mantri kapil sibbal the to kolkata main, par unka dhyaan naa jane kyon modi main hi atka hua tha
 It was said that Modi does not speak anything on any issue
 naa shiksha par riform kii baat karte hai, naa gas kii keemat par kuch bolte hai
 The second attack on Modi was on behalf of Press Council President Markandey Katju
 katju ne naam to nahin liya, lekin modi ke hindu rashtravaadi vaale bayaan par jamkar gussa nikaala

 Although Lalu Yadav took the front, he addressed a public meeting at this place in Hajipur, not Patna
 "mujhamen aaj na vaise utsaah kaa atirek he, na bhavukta kaa andolan hi he
 The reality of society and life is understood a lot
 hindi pattee main padhe-likhon kii sahitya ke prati chai udaseenta or saare samay paise va manoranjan ke peeche bhaagane kii maansikta ne bhi nirantar kshubdh hi kiya he
 How to compel those who do not want to read, to read literature? Whoever asks the writers on it - neither the people of the newspapers nor the media nor the people associated with public relations who are sitting on different grounds of power
 lekhak kii haisiyat ko aankana in sabhi ke boote ke baahar he
 Those who cannot give their opinion on a good book, they cannot tell anything about that author, they will consider the authors as hey
 " yah baat apane daur ke behad kissago amar goswami ne 'kal kaa bharosa' naam se chape kahani sangrah kii 'apni baat' main likhi thi
 Had Amar Goswami today, he would have seen how literature has rapidly made its way into the mainstream
 saahitiyik meley ab saikadon kii sankhya main puure desh main ho rahe hai or india today samooh apni patrikaon main hi nahin balki desh ke sabase tej channel ajtak main bhi sahitya ko pramukhataa se jagah mil rahi he
 Even Sahitya Aaj Tak himself is remembering Amar Goswami on his death anniversary not only by this article but also by publishing his story
 rakesh mishra ne unke bare main likhaa he, "amar goswami kii kahaniyon main kahani ke paatr nahin, kathakaar kaa anubhav bolta he, jo hamaare samaaj kaa hi anubhav he
 We do not get shocked by reading these stories, take a deep sigh and lips are forcibly diagonal
 ham apni musakaan ko lekhak kii kataaksh bhari musakaan se milaae rahete hai or khatm hone par budbudate hai- 'maan gaye guru, kahani aise bhi likhi ja sakati he
 "amar Goswami was born in Multan to a Bengali-speaking family on November 28, 1944 and died in the last week of June
 taarikh thi sambhawatah 28 june, 2012
 Probably written here because somewhere in English on the Internet, this date is written as 26 June
 amar goswami ek charchit kissago the
 After graduating from Hindi literature, he taught in two colleges, but did not mind, and became active in journalism
 vibhinn patr-patrikaon or prakaashan kendron main sampadan sahyog kiya
 He was associated with magazines like 'manorama' and 'ganga' and established a literary institution called 'vaichariki'
 rabindranath tyaagi kaa kahana tha ki amar goswami ko manushya ke man ko parat-dar-parat padhgaye kii shakti praapt he or unki kalam kabhi-kabhi jaadugar kaa danda ho jaati he
 They keep telling the story and you get carried away with them
 kathakaar prakaash manu ise duusare arth main dekhte hai
 According to him, "amar Goswami is one of the few contemporary storytellers who have attained their idiom
" " vaaki agar ham amar goswami kii rachanaaon ko dekhen to yah baat sahi lagati he
 Amar Goswami also wrote a lot in the midst of a life-threatening emergency
 'is daur main humsafar', 'shaabaash munnu' naamak upanyaas or 'himachati', 'mahue kaa ped', 'arany main ham', 'udhaas raghoda', 'buujo bahadur', 'dhartiputra', 'mahabali', 'ikkis kahaniyaan', 'apni-apni duniya', 'bal kaa manorath', 'tohfa tathaa anya charchit kahaniyaan' naamak sankalan to chape hi, bacchon kii bees se zyada pustaken bhi prakashit huin
 He translated more than fifty books in Hindi from Bengali
 kuch kahaniyon kaa tivi roopantaran bhi kiya
 During this time, he was also honored, awarded by Central Hindi Directorate New Delhi, Hindi Academy Delhi, UP Hindi Institute Lucknow, words-soviet Literary Club and other institutions
 chitrakaar ashok bhaumik kaa maananaa tha ki amar goswami kii kahaniyon main baar-baar ek amanviya oonchaai par pahunchakar traasadee or kauthuk ke bich kaa phence tuutakar bikhar jaataa he or dard kii chubhan se ham tahaakaa lagaakar hanste najar aate hai
 It is extremely difficult to find such a craft in any art form, not just in the story
 kathakaar kaa yah shilp na keval unhen vishisht banaata he, balki apane yug ke kathakaar hone kii sarthakata ko bhi chihnit karata he
 In fact, as Pramod Sinha states, "amar Goswami's characters are not deeply demanding of the system, but deeply rooted in the inertia of the system and have a deep resentment towards the status quoism of the system
" ve sahi myne main vipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaate hai
 "his comment which was mentioned at the beginning of this article was published by the Granth Academy in 2004
 isi sankalan main amar goswami ne likhaa ki aaj se tees-pantis saal pehle agar koi mujhase poochta ki main kyon likhata hoon, to us vakt jo jawaab hota, vah aaj main nahin de saktaa
 It was a sentimental period of great enthusiasm for the young man
 lagata-chijen meri mutthi main hai or lekhan main meri sakriyata se bahut kuch badal jayega
 Some such beliefs were also formed by the agility of so-called progressive friends
 jivan main bahut kuch prachaar par chalata he
 Without publicity, Hindi literature has become a decorating item in warehouses or in self-shelves due to not reaching the right readers
 in sabase bachane ke liye kuch gutiy lekhakon ne jarur apane prachaar kaa ek silsilaa bana rakhaa he
 They personally benefit from this; But Hindi literature and other literatures do no better than this
 yah to bhala ho hindi prakashkon kaa, jo vyavsaay ke kaaran lekhakon kii pustaken chhapate rahete hai, jisase lekhakon ko aarthik rup se bhale hi koi khaas laabh na miltaa ho, par kuch pustaken padhanevaali janata tak pahunch to jaati hai
 It is more or less the status of its Hindi society, a desert-like situation, where an oasis is sometimes seen
 aise maahaul main rahakar bhi main kyon likhata hoon? aisi kya vivashtaa he mere saath ? aisi haalat main, jabaki na jane kitne log apane yauvanjanya utsaah ke samaapt hone or kinhi kaarnon se likhnaa band kar chuke hai
 Is my writing 'swantah Sukhay' or is it a pleasure of the mind, which keeps me writing, as many people who are marginalized keep saying about themselves
 main nahin jaanata ki kahanikar ke taur par meri sthit kya he ? isamen bada ‘kanfusion’ he
 But this much i want to tell as a writer that i do not write 'swantah Sukhay', but 'sukhaay'
 yah ‘par sukhaay’ hi meraa ‘swantah sukhaay he
 My concerns about human beings motivate me to write
 darasal or kuch karne ke liye meri kshamta bahut simit he or swabhaav bhi antarmukhi he, thodaa kaayar bhi hoon
 So, should such a person sit quietly and have no resistance? My helplessness has given rise to resistance in me
 main jivan main anyaay ke pratirodh main apni kalam ko mukhar banane kii cheshtaa karata rahata hoon
 When i speak a pen in favor of a proletariat, i get relieved and i get this comfort from the pen of all the writers who speak - even if they are cultists
 likhnaa isliye mere liye jaruri ho gaya he or yah ek nashe kii aadat main badal gaya he
 You write and think that the democracy of the country is speaking with your pen, what can be a more pleasant feeling than this! Writing has constantly compelled me to be responsible, so condemning, praising or neglecting others is no longer meaning to me
 kai vidhaon main likhane ke baavjood main khud ko kathakaar hi maanata hoon
 i try to make the readers see the challenges and disagreements in my stories, in which the common Indian struggles and keeps on blending to improve their future
 uski samayik paraajay main bhi mujhe mahima najar aati he tathaa kamjor kaa bal, jo aanevaale kal ke prati bharosa jagaata he
 Indeed, his stories arouse confidence, provided that Amar Goswami is not there to see it

 He was very impressed with Dhoni
 unhone agle match main yani dhoni ke kariyar ke 5wein match main unhen apni jagah (3 number par) ballebaaji ke liye bheja
 After this Dhoni played a blistering innings of 148 runs in this match
 is ining ke saath dhoni pehle aise bhartiya regular wicketiper ban gaye jisane vanade main centuri lagaai thi
 About this match, Dhoni said, 'that was a do or die situation for me
 wo meraa 5waan match tha or agar us match main main acha nahin kar paata to shaayad chayankarta mujhe drop kar dete
 By hitting the century, it was confirmed that i would play at least 10 matches for India
 ' us match ko bharat 58 ranon se jeeta tha or dhoni ko main of da match chunaa gaya tha
 Ganguly was left with a decision to send Dhonidhoni up in that match was the then Indian team captain Sourav Ganguly
 ganguli ne apane risk par dhoni ko tisare number par ballebaaji ke liye bheja tha
 After the match, Ganguly had said, 'I saw his batting
 wo east jone ke liye vanade khel rahaa tha
 i felt that his aggressive attitude needed a big platform
 use hamane upar bheja or isse dhaoni kaa aatmavishvaas bhi badha or saath hi pakistani bhi chaunk gaye
 Ganguly said, "when Dhoni came into the team in 2004, he batted at number 7 in the first two matches
 pakistan ke khilaaf hone vaale match ke liye jab team kii ghoshnaa hui tab bhi dhoni ke liye 7waan number hi tay tha
 At that time, sitting in my room and watching the news, thinking how to make him (dhoni) a player, i saw that he had potential
 agali subah ham toss jite or maine soch liya ki aaj dhoni ko tisare number par ballebaaji karne ke liye bhejuungaa or phir jo hoga dekha jayega
 "when Ganguly told Dhoni- You have to bat at number three, Hanguly recalls that moment," Dhoni was sitting in shorts because he knew that number 7 in the batting order belongs to him
 maine paas jaakar kaha emes aapako tisare number par ballebaaji kerani he
 He turned back and asked me, you? i said that i will come in fourth

 However, in honor of Ganguly, Dhoni urged him to captain the team which was accepted by Ganguly

 i needed players like Dhoni to remain calm even in moments of pressure
 saath hi jinamein akele apane dam par puure match kaa rukh hi nahin balki uskaa uskaa parinaam badal dene kii kaabiliyat ho
 In the year 2004, my focus was on Dhoni
 ve isi tarah ke khilaadi hai or unki kshamta or pratibha gajab kii he
 i was impressed with Dhoni from day one
 'dhoni ke liye hui thi ladaidhoni jab team india main bataur wicketiper shaamil hue tab deep dasgupta team ke liye wicketcaping karte the, lekin unki ballebaaji dhoni jaisi nahin thi
 At that time, there was a side that wanted Deep Dasgupta to remain the wicketkeeper of the team, while there was another side which Dhoni made his bat crazy
 chayankartaaon ke purv chairman kiran more ne ek baar kaha ki dhoni ke sellection ko lekar selectors ke bich jhagada bhi ho gaya tha
 Former cricketer Kiran More revealed that Dhoni's path to the Indian cricket team was not easy
 lekin dhoni ne apane balle ke dam par captain ganguli kaa dil jeeta or team main ahm jagah banaai
 If Ganguly had not sent Dhoni to number three, Dhoni might not have been the one for whom the whole world is his lover

 The Modi government of Gujarat has suffered a major setback
 gujarat hoicourt ne sarkaar kii arji ko darkinar karte hue kaha he ki gujarat main lokayukta kii niyukti sahi he
 Narendra Modi's government appealed to the High Court against the Lokayukta appointment, which has been rejected by the court
 lokayukta kii niyukti maamle main rajya kii vidhansabha main is par hangaamaa ho chukaa he or bijepi ne kai baar loksabhaa main bhi yah maamla uthaaya tha
 In an unprecedented development in August last year, Gujarat Governor Kamala bypassed the state government and appointed retired judge Justice RA Mehta as the state's Lokayukta against which the state government challenged the Governor's decision in the High Court
 rajya sarkaar saadhe saat saal se lokayukta kii niyukti ko lekar hilaahvaali kar rahi thi
 After Lokayukt's appointment, the Governor said that she could not remain a mute spectator to the things going on in the state

 Blaming the Modi government for not appointing the Lokayukta for the last seven years, the governor said that despite repeated reminders, the government was delaying the matter for some reason
 rajya ke kanishtha kanoon mantri pradipsingh jadeja ne is faisle ko asanvaidhanik or ekatarfa qaraar dete hue use chunauti di or gujarat ucch nyaayalay main yachika daayar kii thi
 The state government argued that under Article 154 of the Constitution, the Governor is bound to take steps on the advice and advice of the Council of Ministers

 lekin mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne shekhavat ke naam par vito kar diya or apane gut ke netaaon se lamabandi bhi karai
 This stance of Vasundhara was directly challenging the central leadership of the party

 Therefore, Shah compensated him for not being made the state president by making him the chairman of the campaign committee

 is sabha main gulab chand kataaria shaamil nahin huen lekin sarkaar main mantri or raaje kii kareebi kiran maheshwari manch par maujuud thim
 Kiran Maheshwari is considered an antagonist to Kataria
 mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje kii rajasthan gaurav yatra kaa antim charan ajmer sambhag main honi he
 The party may also face factionalism in this division
 ajmer sambhag se party ke do bade netaa or mantri vasudev devnani or anitha bhadel ek duusare ke paraspar virdohi bataae jate hai
 However, Rajasthan is proving to be the weakest link for BJP in the three state assembly elections

 Amol Palekar did the comedy with ease in Golmaal but Abhishek Bachchan's effort in the inspired character from Palekar is evident
 bol bachchan kii badali hui kahani or seoup main vaastaviktaa ke bajaay naatakeeyata zyada dikhti he
 Why Abbas is telling his case to the lawyer a day before the court verdict

 But Pahlavani and English speaking enthusiast Ajay Devgan did a strong comedy with Archana Puran Singh and Neeraj Vora

 Bol Bachchan is a remake of the 1979 memorable comedy Golmaal but Bol Bachchan could not match Golmaal

 The changed story and setup of Bol Bachchan seems more dramatic than reality
 kyon court ke faisle se ek din pehle abbaas vakil ko apana cese bataa rahaa he

 'your eardrums are playing drums' (lagata he tumhaare kaan baj rahe hai) lekin jab-jab film abhishek bachchan, asin, asraani or praachi desai ke paas jaati he to yah murajhaane lagati he
 Bol Bachchan is not a class

 kis tarah gujarat ke bahut ahm maane ja rahe is chunavi sangram main raajnneetik dal apane bhagya or cash ke liye tarah tarah ke channelon kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 The activity of some 'anglers' in moving the money here and there has also been revealed
 bataa den ki angdion kaa paaramparik taur par hira kaarobaari istemaal karte rahe hai
 Through them, diamond gems have been transported across Gujarat, Mumbai and New Delhi for generations
 mote lenden ko bina kisi chook or eemaandaaree se anjaam dene kii vajah se angdion ko barason se bharosemand mana jaataa rahaa he
 This is the reason why most anglers are considered to be the backbone of the diamond business
 lekin chupe camere par is system se jude kuch angadiyon ko ye kehete hue kaid kiya gaya he ki kis tarah raajnneetik dalon ne gujarat chunaav se pehle behisabi paise ko idhar se udhar karne ke liye unke network kaa sahaara liya he

 reporter-riskahiteshabhai-dekho, politicians ko maaloom he, adhikariyon ko bhi maaloom he, unka paisa angadia main hi rahata he, sabakaa paisa angadia main rahata he
 Hiteshbhai further claimed that even corrupt leader-bureaucrats consider Gujarat's Angadia network as trustworthy to hide their black money
 hiteshabhai ne kaha, ‘netaa or naukarshah, donon jaanate hai (hamaare kaam ke bare main)
 They all keep money with the anglers
 ’ hiteshabhai ne ye daawa bhi kiya ki gujarat ke kisi bhi kone main matdaan se pehle karency noton ke bandal pahunchaa die jaaenge
 Hiteshbhai said, 'we will make sure that the money reaches the next day
 ye ek din pehle (matdaan se) deliver ho jayega
 We have done this business before
 aapkaa jo bhi paisa 7 tak (7 disambar) mere paas aayega, wo 8 ko aapke thikaanon par pahunchaa diya jayega

 thakkar ne khulaasa kiya ki kyonki wo cash khud saath lekar nahin chalate
 When a consignment of cash is found at a center, their agents deliver the delivery from the cash reserves they have at the fixed location
 thakkar ne kaha,‘kisi bhi centre (jile) par jahaan aap cash bhejnaa chaahate hai, vahaan paise kaa intjaam kiya ja saktaa he
 You call me in two hours to find out which of your centers and which centers you did not

 In this episode, an attempt is being made to create an atmosphere in favor of the party through the promotion of party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who is considered as the trump card of the Congress
 jabaki congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi kaa maharashtra chunaav prachaar ke liye abhi tak koi kaarykram saamne nahin aayaa he
 However, former Congress President Rahul Gandhi will come out from October 13 to campaign in the political battlefield of Maharashtra

 Apart from this, Priyanka's roadshow can also be in Mumbai
 isaki taiyaari shuru kar di gai he
 However, the date of Priyanka's election campaign has not been set yet
 priyanka ko mumbai main aise samay utaara ja rahaa he, jab party main ghamaasan machaa hua he
 Former Mumbai Congress president Sanjay Nirupam is openly defying rebellion

 aise main priyanka gandhi se mumbai main road-sho karakar congress ne shahari vot ko lubhaane kaa plan banaaya he, kyonki vah shahari matadaataaon ke bich acchhee khaasi lokapriy maani jaati hai
 Mumbai has a large population of North Indians, especially Purvanchal in Uttar Pradesh
 priyanka gandhi purvi upi kii prabharee hai
 Due to this, it is believed that the Congress has put Priyanka's roadshow in Mumbai and through this the party wants to woo the voters of Purvanchal
 rahul bhi prachaar main utrenge, sonia kaa kaarykram tay nahincongress mumbai kii siton par zyada focus kar rahi he
 That is why the programs of former Congress President Rahul Gandhi have also been decided in Mumbai

 Of these, the Congress party has held two public meetings of Rahul in Mumbai area

 In the case of the murder of Bihar journalist Rajdev Ranjan, Shahabuddin has said in the Supreme Court that the allegations against him are inspired by politics
 media ne unke maamle ko bada tool diya he
 If they are transferred to Tihar Jail, their rights will be violated
 shahabuddin ne kaha ki agar saare 45 cese sibiai ko transfar kiye gaye to maamle kii sunwaayee main or deree hogi kyonki maamalon se sambandhit dastavej jutaney main do saal lag jaaenge
 Today the debate was completed by Shahabuddin
 buudhvaar ko sibiai apana paksh rakhegi
 The court held an important hearing to transfer cases against Bihar RJD (RJD) leader Mohammad Shahabuddin and Delhi
 pichhali sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne bihar sarkaar se poocha tha ki agar nichali adaalat ne shahabuddin ko bahes ke liye vakil muhaiyaa karaayaa tha to us aadesh ko hoicourt main chunauti dene kii jarurat kya thi
 If Shahabuddin was seeking legal help from the court, what was the harm in giving it to him
 is par bihar sarkaar ne kaha tha ki shahabuddin ko vidhik sahaayta kii jarurat nahin thi or sarkaar iskaa kharchaa nahin uthaanaa chaahati thi, kyonki shahabuddin sakasham hai ki ve apane liye kisi vakil ko bahes ke liye niyukt kar saken
 In fact, the sessions court had made Shahabuddin a lawyer through legal aid to debate the pending cases against him, which was challenged by the Bihar government in the High Court and the High Court stayed the order of the sessions court
 iske baad uske khilaaf sabhi maamalon par roak lag gai thi
 At the same time, the Bihar government again said that Shahabuddin should not be transferred from Bihar nor the case
 vahiin shahabuddin kii taraf se kaha gaya ki vah pichley 11 saal se jail main he, aise main uske paas paise nahin hai ki ve bahes ke liye vakil rakh saken
 The comments maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan yachikakarta kii taraf se kaha gaya ki jis taraf pappu yadav ko bihar kii jail se dilli kii tihaad jail main transfar kiya gaya tha or maamle kii sunwaayee bihar main hi ho rahi thi usee tarah shahabuddin ko bihar se tihaad jail transfar kar maamle kii sunwaayee bihar main hi kii ja sakati he
 Shahabuddin can be produced in court through video conferencing if needed
 supreme court ne saaf kiya ki jo maamle hai court ke saamne lambit hai unamem dakhal nahin denge lekin shahabuddin ko bihar se tihaad jail transfar kiya jaae yaa nahin, is par vichaar jarur karenge
 The cases which are pending in the lower court should be transferred to Delhi or not or will transfer Shahabuddin to Tihar and continue the trial in the lower court
 agar jarurat hogi ho shahabuddin ko video conferencing ke jariye adaalat main pesh kiya ja sakegaa
 Shahabuddin said that if all 45 cases were transferred to the CBI, the hearing of the case would be delayed further as it would take two years to gather the documents related to the cases
 aaj shahabuddin kii taraf se bahes puri ho gai
 The CBI will present its case on Wednesday
 bihar ke rajd (argedy) netaa mohammad shahabuddin or unke khilaaf maamalon ko dilli transfar karne ko lekar court ne ahm sunwaayee kii
 During the last hearing, the Supreme Court had asked the Bihar government that if the lower court had provided Shahabuddin a lawyer for debate then what was the need to challenge that order in the High Court
 agar shahabuddin adaalat se legal madad maang rahaa tha to usko dene main harj kya tha
 On this, the Bihar government said that Shahabuddin did not need legal assistance and the government did not want to spend it, because Shahabuddin is able to appoint a lawyer for himself
 darasal seshan court ne shahabudin ko uske khilaaf lambit maamalon main bahes ke liye legal aid ke jariye vakil uplabdh karaayaa tha jisko bihar sarkaar ne hoicourt main chunauti di thi or hai court ne seshan court ke aadesh par roak laga di thi
 After this, all the cases against him were stayed
 vahiin bihar sarkaar ne phir kaha ki shahabuddin ko bihar se transfar na kiya jaae or na hi cese ko
 On the other hand, it was said on behalf of Shahabuddin that he has been in jail for the last 11 years, so he does not have the money to hire a lawyer for debate
 tippaniyan During the hearing of the case, it was said on behalf of the petitioner that on the way, Pappu Yadav was transferred from Bihar jail to Tihar Jail in Delhi and the case was being heard in Bihar in the same way Shahabuddin was transferred from Bihar to Tihar Jail
