 9 / 11 ke baad hangaamaa machaa to usne duniya ko chakma dene ke liye apane aatankwaadi sanghathan lashkar-e-tayba kaa naam badal diya
 The newly renamed jamaat-ud-dawa was followed by 26 / 11 in Mumbai, then he played the same game again
 abaki jamaat-ud-daawa kaa naam badal diya or phir ek nayaa naam rakhaa taharik-e-hurmat-e-rasul
 But the game was the same
 aatank failaana
 But now the mask has been removed from the face of Lashkar Chief Hafiz Saeed
 kyonki sanyukt raashtra ke baad ab america ne bhi jamaat-ud-daawa or uske sahyogi sanghathanon ko aatankwaadi sanghathan ghoshit kar diya he
 This maneuver of the terrorist organization Lashkar is very old, sometimes its face, sometimes its whereabouts, and sometimes it changed its name to throw dust in the eyes of the world
 magar is baar uskaa mansuba naakaam ho gaya
 lashkar-e-taiba was banned after 9–11 attacks on America
 jiske baad hafiz said ne pehali baar chali thi ek nai chaal
 He gave a new name to jamaat-ud-dawa
 iske baad isi naam se wo puure pakistan or aasapaas ke ilaake main apni jehadi karrwai chalaata rahaa
 Then after the Mumbai attack, Hafiz Saeed did the same old trick to avoid the eyes of security agencies around the world
 jamaat-ud-daawa yani lashkar ke majahabi chehre ko ab ek baar phir badal diya
 Jamaat-ud Dawa had now become tehreek-e-hurmat-e-rasool
 hafiz said kaa iraadaa saaf tha jab-jab uske aatankwaadi sanghathan par pabandi lagegi wo isi tarah apana naam badal kar jehad kaa jehar ugalta rahegaa
 Sometimes in the name of charity, sometimes in the name of mere
 darasal mumbai hamalon ke baad sanyukt raashtra kii suraksha parishad ne pakistani sanghathan jamaat-ud-daawa par bhi pabandi laga di thi
 And it was becoming difficult for him to work in any corner of the world with this name, that's why Hafiz Saeed had done a new trick
 aisi chaal jise wo pehle bhi kai baar kamyaabi ke saath aajamaa chukaa tha
 But his motives were still equally dangerous
 wo ab bhi duniya bhar main jehad kaa danka peetna chahta tha
 With the changed name as before
 lekin sanyukt raashtra ke baad ab america ne bhi jamaat-ud-daawa ko aatankwaadi sanghathan ghoshit kar diya he
 Not only this, along with the Jamaat, its associate organizations tehreek-e-hurmat-e-rasool and Al Anfal Trust have also been declared as terrorist organizations
 iske saath-saath america ne in donon sanghathanon ke liye fund jutaney or network taiyaar karne ke iljaam main nazeer ahamed choudhary or mohammad hossain gil ko antarrashtriya aatankwaadi bhi ghoshit kar diya he
 Both of them are accused of working for Hafiz Saeed
 america or sanyukt raashtra hafiz said kaa naam pehle hi duniya ke sabase khatarnaak aatankwaadiyon kii suchi main daal chuke hai
 Not only this, America has also placed a reward of ten million dollars or about 60 crores on its head

 He said that dismissing the big and dangerous batsmen of the opposing team early will be very important in this tournament
 ‘tii20 tiimon main zyada fark nahin’dhoni ne kaha, ‘chote formet main tiimon ke bheetar zyada fark nahin rahata

 purush apane pyaar kaa izhaar karne ke maamle main sust hote hai
 According to a research 97 to meet the woman of his choice
 3 dinon baad hi ve usase apane pyaar kaa izhaar kar pate hai
 Research conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) of the US, however, states that those who hastily wait for their love 'cannot be trusted'

 Men also like to hear 'I love you' from women, but if the woman calls her 'I love you' many times in the initial stages of their relationship, then it is interpreted negatively
 isse ulat, agar koi mahila kaaphi soch-samajhakar apane pasand ke purush ko 'ai lav you' kahati ho to iskaa bhi galat arth nikaala jaataa he
 Men understand that such women are not serious about their relationship

 In the Test series between India and Australia, if a player has the most eyes on Virat Kohli
 team india kaa yah 28 varshiya captain is samay kariyar ke sarvshereshth form main hai
 The Australian team is considering him as the biggest challenge in front of them
 viraat ke balle se lagaataar ran nikal rahe hai
 Virat has played many big innings in the domestic season
 newjiland, england or bangladesh ke khilaaf dilli ke is ballebaaj ne na keval dohare shatak banaae balki captain ke taur par bhi team india ko preranadai netritv pradaan kiya
 In such a situation, the Australian team led by Steve Smith knows very well that if he has to do well on the tour of India, Virat will only have to devise an effective strategy to get out soon
 pune test ke thik pehle australian team ke paanch khilaadiyo ne is bare main apni raay jataai ki aakhirkaar koun si baat viraat ko mahaan ballebaaj banaati he

 Kohli is currently being compared to Sir Don Bradman of cricket's greatest batsman in Australia
 breadman kaa test ausat 99
 Is of 94
 australian team aamtaur par vipakshi team ke pramukh ballebaaj par dabaav banane ke liye chhintakashi (sledging) kii ranneeti apanaati he, lekin kohli kaa khauf is kadar he ki vah kohli ke khilaaf is par kaam karne se bhi hichak rahi he
 Australia batsman David Warner, the leading batsman of the team, believes that the sledding scheme against Kohli could backfire and the captains of Team India are motivated to give it their best performance
 darasal sachin tendulkar kii tarah kohli kii bhi yahi khaasiyat he ki apane khilaaf kisi bhi tarah kii chhintakashi unhen or behatar pradarshan karne ko josh bharti he or australian team nishchit hi yah nahin chaahegi

 Bradman's test average 99

 The Australian team usually adopts the strategy of sledging to put pressure on the leading batsman of the opposition team, but Kohli's awe is such that he is reluctant to work against Kohli
 australia team ke pramukh ballebaaj david warner kaa maananaa he ki kohli ke khilaaf sledging kii yojana ulti pad sakati he or team india ke captain isse apana sarvshereshth pradarshan dene ke liye prerit hote hai
 In fact, like Sachin Tendulkar, Kohli also has the same specialty that any kind of spanking against him inspires him to perform better and the Australian team certainly would not like it

 To expand its influence in the field of science and technology, the center plans to set up science cities across the country
 kendriya vigyaan evam praudyogiki rajya mantri vaai es choudhary ne yah baat kahi
 Bloomberg will invest in building 'smart city', said, "the whole idea is to ensure that science and technology is available in the entire country
 aaj kuch rajyon ne vigyaan evam shodh prayogshaalaon kii sahi sankhya hasil kii he jabaki anya rajyon ke paas nahin he
 The idea behind this idea is to use the Hub and Spoke model to establish five to six zones covering science centers in all states
 ’unhone kaha, ‘maamle par charchaa chal rahi he
 Each center (region) will have a science city and in turn will serve the scientific institutions of different states
 ’ unhone kaha ki prayek kshetra main science city main shodh prayogshaalaon or kanvension centre samet sabhi aadharbhoot sanrachanaayen hongi, jahaan sammelnon kaa aayojan kiya ja saktaa he
 Chaudhary said that there is immense potential in the country to promote science and technology
 unhone kaha, ‘prastaavit jone na sirf shodh ko protsaahan denge balki shiksha denge or chaatro ko prerit karenge
 We have to show the right direction to the youth
 agar ham unhen vigyaan evam shodh kii taraf aakarshith kar sakenge to isse adhik udhyam ko badhaava milegaa or aakhirkaar yah badi hui aarthik gatividhi kaa rup legaa
 ' bharat ke purv captain or original little master ke naam se mashhoor sunil gavaskar dhoni ke bachaav main aa gaye hai
 In the Dominica Test, Dhoni gave Raza a slump for the draw without trying to win
 lekin gavaskar ne apane kollam main likhaa he bharat ne west indies daure par apana mishan puraa kiya he
 The team won both the ODI and Test series
 gavaskar ne yah bhi kaha ki dukh kii baat yag he ki jinhone apane jivan main kabhi koi aadesh nahin diya wo bhi captaini kii baat karte hai
 Those who questioned Dhoni probably consider themselves bigger than Sir Don Bradman and Sir Gary
 bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko desh kaa sabase bada mudda bataate hue yoga guru baba ramdev ne kaha he ki aagaamee chunaavon main unka sanghathan bhartiya janata party ke piem pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ko tabhi samarthan degaa jab vah videshon main rakhe kaale dhan ko waapas laane ke bare main aashwaasan denge
 Baba Ramdev said, we have many issues
 inamen kaale dhan kaa mudda sabase pramukh he, kyonki videshi bainkon main itnaa dhan padaa he ki agar vah sab yahaan laayaa jaae to desh ke prayek gaanv ke hisse main karodon rupee aayenge
 Every village in India can be developed with these money
 yoga ke kshetra main kranti laane vaale ramdev ne kaha, 'narendra modi agar mujhe kaala dhan waapas laane kaa aashwaasan dete hai tabhi main unako apana samarthan duungaa
 However, BJP also wants to bring back the black money and personally Modi is an honest person
 isliye mujhe lagata he ki vah bhi is mudde par apni sahmati jataa sakate hai
 Baba Ramdev told that he is going to have a rally at Talkatora Stadium in New Delhi
 isse pehle vah bijepi netritv se in muddon par baatcheet karenge or unke muddon par sahmati bani tabhi vah isi raily main modi ko samarthan dene kaa aupchaarik elaan kar sakate hai
 However, Baba also said that both Congress and BJP are corrupt parties, but Congress and all its leaders are immersed in corruption
 lekin bijepi ke saath aisa nahin he
 Some leaders of this party are corrupt but its top leadership is of a clean and clean image
 kharif kii fasal kaa nunatam samarthan mulya (emspi) ghoshit karne ke baad pehali barpradhanmantri narendra modi nepunjab main raily kii
 PM Modi's eyes were mainly on farmers through this rally in Muktsar Mallot
 modi kii yah raily bhale hi 'kisaan kalyaan raily' ke taur par pesh kii gai ho, lekin iske kuch raajnneetik myne bhi hai
 Indeed, Modi's rally in Malot in southern Punjab is aimed at gaining a farmer vote bank in Punjab for the BJP
 kyonki sarkaar dwaara haal hi main emspi ko lekar kii gai ghoshnaa ke baad yadi kisi rajya ke kisaanon ko sabase zyada phayda hoga to wo punjab ke kisaan hai
 If we look at the data, then 90 percent of the paddy and wheat produced in Punjab is purchased at government purchasing centers
 aise main haal hi main emspi ko lekar hui ghoshnaaon kaa sidhaa asar yahaan ke kisaan vot bank par dikhegaa
 The benefit of the government's announcement about MSP is going to benefit the farmers in the same areas where their produce goes directly to the government purchasing centers
 krishi visheshgyon ke mutabik desh main hone vaale gehun or dhan kii kul upaj kaa keval 35 fisadi hi sarkari kray kendron main jaataa he
 In the case of pulses and oilseeds, this average gets worse and stops at 20-25 percent
 punjab main best quality kaa khadyann utpaadan hone kii vajah se yahaan kaa adhiktar anaaj sarkari kray kendron par kharid liya jaataa he
 Apart from Punjab, these states also have an eye, in addition to this, through PM Modi's 'kisan Kalyan Rally', Modi will also target farmers of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan
 iske peeche vajah he 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa or vidhasanabha chunaav
 Let us tell you that there are assembly elections in Haryana along with the Lok Sabha elections in 2019
 isse pehle rajasthan main vidhansabha chunaav honge
 In such a rally, bjp-akali leaders of the Center and the state will try to get a farmer vote bank
 kisaanon kii aay doguni karnaa isliye he chunautigauratlab he ki modi sarkaar ne desh main kisaanon kii aamadani ko 2022 tak doguna karne kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 Had the government started trying to reach this target in 2015, by 2022, the annual income of farmers would have increased by 12 per cent for 7 consecutive years and the target would have been achieved, but this could not happen
 2015 main bajet satr ke dauraan pradhanmantri modi ne kisaanon kii aamadani ko saat saal main doguna karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 This promise was repeated in all the Union Budgets presented thereafter
 lekin 2022 ke lakshya se bandhe is vaade ko puraa karne kii liye teen saal tak sarkaar ne apana rodmap nahin banaaya
 Looking at the state of agriculture sector for the last three years, it seems that it is not only impossible for the central government to achieve this target in the given time
 centre sarkaar ne is lakshya ko praapt karne ke liye ashok dalwai kii adhyakshata main ek antar mantralayan samiti kaa gathan kiya
 During the last two years, this committee has prepared its report after intensive study of the country's agricultural sector
 is report par philhal mantralay ne janata kaa suzav maanga he jiske baad ummid he ki vah apni report puri karte hue centre sarkaar ko kisaanon kii aamadani doguni karne ke formule par sifarish pesh kar de
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has said that BJP and RJD are with each other in the state and both are campaigning together

 Nitish Kumar said about the Prime Minister that he is not aware of the facts
 gauratlab he ki pehle pradhanmantri ne nitish sarkaar kii aalochana karte hue kaha tha ki pradesh sarkaar ne apane yahaan centre kii yojanaon ko thik tareeke se lagu nahin kiya

 Shikhar has said that he will play his first Test match as an experienced player
 tippaniyan On the other hand, his Delhi teammate Ishant Sharma will play the 50th Test of his career in Mohali, although his journey of 50 Test matches has not been very good, because his average is not good
 darasal, ek visheshgy gendbaaj ke liye 38
 An average of 52 is not considered good and that is why Ishant, who has started his international career with a lot of bang, has not been included in the list of top bowlers so far
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki 50 ke aasapaas test match khilne vaale visheshgy gendbaajon main kisi kaa bhi ausat ishanth jitna kharaab nahin rahaa he, lekin ab ishanth ke paas mohali main acha pradarshan karne kaa mauka he, kyonki yahaan kii pich unki madad kar sakati he
 In fact, Sehwag was dropped from Team India for the third and fourth Test matches after the visitors failed miserably in the first two matches against Australia, and then it was decided that Dhawan and Murali Vijay would open the innings in Mohali
 shikhar dhawan shrunkhlaa se pehle ghoshit kii gai 15-sadasyeey test team main shaamil the, lekin sahvaag or murali jaise anbhavi khilaadiyon ke rahete unhen apane kariyar kaa aagaaz karne kaa mauka nahin mila tha
 However, Shikhar Dhawan has experience of scoring a lot of runs in domestic cricket and that is why he is not nervous before his debut
 shikhar ne kaha he ki vah ek anbhavi khilaadi ke taur par apana pehla test match khelenge
 The comments duusari ore, dilli kii team ke unke saathi ishanth sharma mohali main apane kariyar kaa 50waan test khelenge, haalanki 50 test maichon kaa unka safar khaas acha nahin rahaa he, kyonki unka ausat acha nahin he
 Actually, 38 for a specialist bowler
 52 kaa ausat acha nahin mana jaataa he or isi kaaran kaaphi dhamaake ke saath antarrashtriya kariyar kaa aagaaz karne vaale ishanth ab tak khud ko sheersh gendbaajon kii suchi main shaamil nahin kar paae hai
 Experts believe that none of the specialist bowlers playing Test matches around 50 have been as poor as Ishant, but now Ishant has a chance to do well in Mohali, as the pitch here can help him

 One aspect of backward politics was that the Congress was marginalized in these states
 congress main pichhadon kaa pratinidhitiv hameshaa hi behad kam rahaa he isiilie usamen aaj bhi bamushkil kuch hi bade pichde netaa najar aate hai
 Sitaram Kesari had definitely become Congress President for some time to say, but he had no special hold
 ab jarur ashok gahalot, sachin payalat jaise netaa dikhte hai
 Here, of course Congress President Rahul Gandhi has increased the focus on backward castes
 nabbe ke dashak ke saath-saath hi sangh parivaar or bhaajapa main bhi obisi or dalit jatiyon main paith banane kaa ehsaas gaharaaya or mandal raajnneeti ke saamaajik nyaay ke naare kii jagah soshal ejineering kii ranneeti taiyaar kii jane lagi

 Govindacharya was the architect of this social engineering strategy
 lihaaja, kalyaan singh, uma bharti, vinay katiyaar jaise netaaon kaa ubhaar hua
 Later, leaders like Narendra Modi and Shivraj Singh Chauhan were able to establish their place in the mainstream
 lekin nabbe ke dashak ke baad kareeb paune teen dashakon main ganga main kaaphi pani bah chukaa he
 Backward leaders began to lose their luster and turned into family advocates and advocates of a particular caste, who were disillusioned with the rest of the backward castes
 masalan, lalu yadav kaa rajd or mulaayam kii samaajawaadee party yadavon kii partiyaan banakar rah gayi
 With this, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who belongs to the Kurmi caste to mobilize the extremely backward, proved his importance by initiating the mobilization of extremely backward class, Mahadalit and Pasamanda (backward) Muslims in Bihar
 ab bihar main kabhi unke saath rahe koyri jati ke upendra kushvaha bhi ati pichhadon kii nai golbandi kaa daawa karte hai
 Kushwaha is also a minister at the center
 uttar pradesh main khaskar 2009 main ati pichde vot mulaayam se tuutakar congress kii ore gaye jisase use rajya main 22 sansadeey siten hasil huin
 But the 2014 general elections completely changed all this mathematics and Modi, as the leader of the backward, also claimed
 yaad kiijie congress kii priyanka gandhi ne apane pita purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi par modi ke kiye akshep par unhen "neech raajnneeti'' karne kaa doshi tehraaya to modi ne ise apane nichali jati kaa hone kaa hawala dekar sahanubhuti hasil karne kii koshish kii
 The votes BJP got in the name of Modi, especially the most backward, created history
 isi vajah se pichhadon voton par aaj sabase adhik jor raajnneeti main dikhataa he
 Backward politics in other states of North India is now turning
 rajasthan main obisi uljhanrajasthan main rajya suchi main obisi kii 91 jatiyaan hai or inamen jat sabase asardaar jati he jisaki aabaadi main hissedari 9 se 12 fisadi maani jaati he
 The number of Jat mlas is more than 25

 Ram Pratap, a minister in the BJP government of the state, can be called the prominent Jat leader of the BJP
 rajya main zyaadaatar obisi netaaon kaa asar sthaneey str kaa rahaa he lekin do bade congress netaa iske apwaad hai
 The chief ministerial candidate is Sachin Pilot Gurjar while former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is from Mali caste
 payalat pradesh congress adhyaksh hai
 The state has three mlas from Mali caste while the number of Gurjar mlas is six
 sarkaar ke mantri prabhulaal saini mali samudaay se bhaajapa ke pramukh netaa hai
 The OBC is not an organized political power here as castes have mutual problems
 jaise, jaaton ko obisi darja milane se pehle gurjar hameshaa yah maanate the ki aarakshan main mali unka hissaa maar rahe hai
 When the Jats got the status, the Gurjars started demanding the status of Scheduled Tribes for themselves and the Malis demanded the separation of the original list of obcs, which do not contain Jats
 jaaton ke alaava gurjar, mali, bishnoi, kumavat, sindhi muslim, ravat or yadav jaisi kuch pramukh jatiyaan hai, jinke 15 vidhayak hai or in jatiyon ke prabhaav vaali kareeb 30 siten hai
 The number of Jat bearing seats is around 40
 kul milakar dekha jaae to rajasthan main obisi jatiyon ke asar vaali 50 se 60 siten hai lekin unke vidhayakon kii sankhya utani nahin ho paati
 One thing has also come to light that it has become difficult for Jat candidates to win since getting OBC status
 jat vidhayakon kii sankhya ghatati ja rahi he kyonki anya jatiyon ke matadaata gaiyr jat ummidavaar ke paksh main matdaan kar rahe hai
 However, the BJP has deployed a large number of Jat officers to important positions
 kai siton par jat matadaata sangathit hai or bhaajapa ko ummid he ki jat voter bhaajapa ke jat pratyaashee ko pasand karenge
 The BJP also hopes that the Congress will face the resentment of the Jats as Barmer Rajput leader Manvendra Singh has recently been inducted into the Congress
 jaaton or rajputon main chhattis kaa aankada he
 The dominance of backward leaders in Madhya Pradesh but the mathematics of obcs in Madhya Pradesh is something else
 yahaan lodhi, kurmi, kiraar, kalar, patidaar, jat, khaati, meena, kaachhi or dangi pichde varg kii pramukh jatiyaan hai
 Madhya Pradesh has an OBC Chief Minister for the last 15 years, which shows what is the political strength of the castes of this class
 haalanki aadhikarik aankade uplabdh nahin hai, phir bhi mana jaataa he ki obisi main kurmi votaron kii sankhya sabase zyada he
 Kurmis are quite numerous in Satna, Rewa, and Sidhi, while they also have a good presence in Shajapur, Panna, Chhatarpur and Shahdol

 In this era of caste tensions, the role of OBC has become more important
 ''obisi kii prayogshaala biharbihar obisi politics kaa bada centre rahaa he
 Here, OBC leaders have been in power in the hands of OBC leaders for nearly 28 years, yet many castes are still away from power
 mungery laal ayog kii report ke mutabik, kareeb 128 jatiyaan pichhadaa varg ke taur par chinhit kii gayi lekin inamen sau se zyada jatiyon kaa koi raajnneetik pratinidhitiv nahin he
 It is estimated that the population of the Yadavas is 14 per cent and is followed by Kushwaha, Kurmi etc

 But it is also true that the party and leader who will have the support of OBC, will have power

 26 saal ke narendra karma kehete hai, "yahaan plant aa rahaa he yah bataa hamen media ke zariye hi pataa lagi
 Nobody has talked to us
 pichley dinon akhabaaron main yah chhapane laga ki log is plant ke aane se khush hai
 But the people in whose name those things were printed, people of that name do not live in these villages at all
 " On the other hand, Steel Minister Narendra Singh Tomar explains to the journalists before the Prime Minister's public meeting in Dantewada, "it is true that the plant is in initial stage right now
 lekin isse adivaasiyon kaa bhala hi hoga
 The MMDR (mining) bill that has been brought in Modi's government, has a provision to deposit money for the welfare of these areas by creating District Mineral Foundation
 logon ko yahaan zarur naukariyaan milengi
 They will be well " But for the people of Dillmili and other villages, the old experiences have been quite bad
 pandu wetty kehete hai, "sar yahaan adivaasiyon ke liye halaat kabhi nahin sudharte
 "I ask- Has not the situation been corrected by the coming of NMDC plant? Pandu Vaitti -" No sir
 pichley chalis saalon se sthaneey logon kaa koi bhala nahin hua he
 The government says through the news that NMDC made a profit and spent it for the good of the people, but it does not happen
 " But is it that the situation has not changed at all? Education City and Livelihood College is seen today in Dantewada, which is deserted, and the Prime Minister came here to record 'mann Ki Baat' program with tribal children, but perhaps all these efforts are still limited to the publicity system
 bastar ke aam logon tak iskaa phayda nahin pahunchaa he
 Apart from NMDC, Essar Company is already mining here
 iske alaava tata company kaa plant laane kii yojana he
 There is a total of 70 million tonnes of iron in Kiranadur and Bacheli of Bastar
 sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya bastar main nijee companiyon kii koi zarurat he? Another tribal who came to attend the meeting says, "if you go inside (in the villages), you will see that not a single person has developed
 enemdisi ke ilaake main bas vah township hi he, jahaan unke apane log rahete hai
 If you go one kilometer from there, the reality will be seen
 " i stand some distance away from the public meeting and talk to these people
 sabhasthal se phir awaz aati he, "sarkaar hamen guard kii naukari nahin de sakati to koun si company main koun si naukari degi
 If it cannot give us the job of bell-ringer, then how will it give the job of machine-driver
 plant se badi zarurat hamen tubewel kii he, handpump kii he
 If the government imposes that then we will benefit more
 " log bataate hai ki in saare gaanvon kii zyaadaatar zamin bahufasali he
 Here farmers grow other crops and vegetables along with maize and paddy, which have been a safe employment for them
 unki shikaayat he ki sarkaar banjar zamin par plant kyon nahin laga rahi he
 Burungpal village head Sumaru Karama starts speaking, “our people go out of here to find jobs and outsiders come here and do jobs
 paas main nagarnar main enemdisi kaa jo plant aayaa vahaan kisi ko naukari nahin mili
 "comments is ilaake main maovadi nahin hai lekin ve is ilaake se bahut dur bhi nahin hai
 i ask whether these people think that the government can imprison these villagers as anti-development or pro-naxalites
 yturam mandavi kehete hai, "mere ko us baat kii chintaa nahin he
 i am not a Naxalite
 agar wo mere puure parivaar ko jail main daal dete hai, puri basti ko jail main daal dete hai or phir plant lagaae, to hamen koi dikkat nahin he
 " lautate hue mujhe pradhanmantri modi ke shabd phir yaad aate hai
 Not having a gun on the shoulder (employment) is the solution to the problem
 lekin kya ham in adivaasiyon ke kandhe se unka hal nahin hataa rahe? Lack of trust is the biggest problem today in Bastar and all the tribal areas of the country
 adivaasiyon ko sarkaar kii baton par to bharosa he hi nahin, ve un netaaon ko bhi shaq kii nazar se dekh rahe hai jo unke liye awaz uthaane in ilaakon main aate hai
 Some two and a half dozen villages, including Dillamili, Burungpal and Chidpal, have stood up against the government's proposed mega steel plant, but they talk of keeping political parties away from it
 "ham is ladaai main netaaon par bharosa nahin kar sakate
 They will either use us as a vote bank or they will compromise with the company and take money in return for our strength ”
 
 
 sabha ko sambodhit karte hue ek aadmi kii awaz aati he
 26-year-old Narendra Karama says, "we came to know through the media that the plant is coming here
" hamase kisi ne baat tak nahin kii he
 Recently it started appearing in newspapers that people are happy with the arrival of this plant
 lekin jin logon ke naam se ve baaten chhaapi gayi, us naam ke log in gaanvon main rahete hi nahin hai
 " udhar ispaat mantri narendra singh tomars dantewada main pradhanmantri kii jansabha se pehle patrakaron ko samajhaate hai, "yah sach he ki abhi plant aarambhik sthiti main he
 But this will only benefit the tribals
 modi ji kii sarkaar main jo mmdiar (khanan) bill laayaa gaya he, usamen district mineral foundation bana kar in ilaakon ke kalyaan ke liye paisa jamaa karne kaa praavdhaan he
 People will definitely get jobs here
 unka bhala hoga
 " lekin dilamily or duusare gaanvon ke logon ke liye puraane anubhav kaaphi kharaab rahe hai
 Pandu Vetti says, "sir, the situation never improves for the tribals here
 " main poochta hum- kya enemdisi kaa plant aane se halaat thik nahin hue he? pandu vatti – "nahin sar
 For the last forty years, the locals have not benefited
 sarkaar to jaise ki news ke madhyam se kahati he ki enemdisi ne munafa kiya or use logon ke bhale ke liye kharch kiya par aisa hota nahin he
 " lekin kya aisa he ki halaat bilkul nahin badale hai? sunsaan se pade rahane vaale dantewada main aaj ajukeshan city or livelihud cholez dikh rahaa he or yahaan aakar pradhanmantri ne adivasee bacchon ke saath 'man kii baat' kaarykram kii recording bhi kii lekin shaayad yah sari koshish abhi prachaar tantra tak hi simit hai
 The common people of Bastar have not benefited from this
 enemdisi ke alaava essar company pehle hi yahaan khanan kar rahi he
 Apart from this, the Tata company plans to bring its plant
 bastar ke kirandur or bacheli main kul 70 karod ton loha he
 The question is arising whether there is any need of private companies in Bastar? sabha main shaamil hone aayaa ek anya adivasee kaa kahana he, "aap andar (gaanvon main) jaakar dekhenge to pataa chalegaa ki ek bhi vyakti kaa vikaas nahin hua he
 In the area of NMDC, it is the only township where their own people live
 vahaan se ek kilometre andar jaaenge to asaliyat dikh jaaegi
 " main jansabha se kuch dur khadaa hokar in logon se baat kar rahaa hum
 a voice again comes from the synagogue, "if the government cannot give us a guard job, then what company will give what job? yah hamen ghanti bajaane vaale kii naukari nahin de sakati to mashin chalaane vaale kii naukari kaise degi
 We need tubewells, hand pumps, bigger than the plant
 sarkaar vah lagaae to hamaara adhik phayda hoga
 "people say that most of the land in all these villages is multi-cropped
 yahaan makka or dhan ke saath kisaan anya fasalein or sabziyaan ugaate hai, jo unke liye ek surakshit rojgaar rahaa he
 Their complaint is why the government is not setting up a plant on barren land
 burungpal gaanv ke pradhan sumaru karma bolnaa shuru karte hai, "hamaare log yahaan se baahar jaakar naukari dhundte hai or baahar vaale yahaan aakar naukari karte hai
 No one got a job at the NMDC plant in Nagarnar nearby
 "tippaniyan There are no Maoists in this area but they are not too far from this area
 main poochta hum ki kya in logon ko is baat kaa khyal he ki sarkaar in gaanv waalon ko vikaas virdohi yaa naksali samarthak bataakar jail main daal sakati he
 Aayaturam Mandavi says, "I am not worried about that
 main naksali nahin hum
 If they put my whole family in jail, put the entire colony in jail and then plant, then we have no problem
 " Returning, i remember the words of Prime Minister Modi again
 kandhe par bandook nahin hal (rojgaar) hona hi samasya kaa hal he
 But are we not removing their solution from the shoulders of these tribals? "ham is ladaai main netaaon par bharosa nahin kar sakate

 agar wo mere puure parivaar ko jail main daal dete hai, puri basti ko jail main daal dete hai or phir plant lagaae, to hamen koi dikkat nahin he
 " lautate hue mujhe pradhanmantri modi ke shabd phir yaad aate hai
 Not having a gun on the shoulder (employment) is the solution to the problem
 lekin kya ham in adivaasiyon ke kandhe se unka hal nahin hataa rahe? There are no Maoists in this area but they are not too far from this area
 main poochta hum ki kya in logon ko is baat kaa khyal he ki sarkaar in gaanv waalon ko vikaas virdohi yaa naksali samarthak bataakar jail main daal sakati he
 Aayaturam Mandavi says, "I am not worried about that
 main naksali nahin hum
 If they put my whole family in jail, put the entire colony in jail and then plant, then we have no problem
 " Returning, i remember the words of Prime Minister Modi again
 kandhe par bandook nahin hal (rojgaar) hona hi samasya kaa hal he
 But are we not removing their solution from the shoulders of these tribals? lautate hue mujhe pradhanmantri modi ke shabd phir yaad aate hai
 Not having a gun on the shoulder (employment) is the solution to the problem
 lekin kya ham in adivaasiyon ke kandhe se unka hal nahin hataa rahe? After a long wait, the practice of putting a smart pole has finally started in Connaught Place, the heartland of Delhi
 ji haa endiemasi ne conot place sthit central park ke baahar smart pole lagaaya he
 The special thing is that this smart poll will work to open all the polls in Delhi
 jaahir he aap soch rahe honge ki smart pole yani smart khamba dilli kii koun si pole kholegaa? to ham aapako bataa den ki atyaadhunik suvidhaon se las is smart pole main sisitivi camera, free vaai-faai, elidi screen or pradooshan maapne kaa yantra laga hua he
 That is, the camera of this smart pole with a height of about 12 meters will record all the activities surrounding it, even information about the air and air pollution of Delhi will be available from this smart pole
 smart city plan kaa he hissaayendiemasi ke mutabik puraane khambon ko riples kar nai dilli ilaake main smart pole lagaae jaaenge
 The plan to install these smart poles made of steel is part of the smart city scheme
 endiemasi ne smart khamba ke alaavasolar polabhi lagaaya he
 The solar pole will also have a camera, which is typical that the LED bulb burns when the sky is cloudy
 smart pole kii khaasiyaten- aasapaas kii gatividhiyon ko behtareen tareeke se record karne ke liye smart pole main 2 mega picksal kaa ghumaavdaar camera lagaaya gaya he
 Information about increasing pollution in Delhi will also be available

 Information about the level of 5 and PM 10 will be found

 With such a smart poll, about 50 MB of internet can be used daily through about 75 devices
 0- elidi screen ke saath hi is smart pole main 3
 There is also a 220 watt LED light, which will automatically extinguish to adapt to the weather
 smart city pariyojna ke tahat endiemasi ne saal 2015 ke bajet main smart pole kaa zikr kiya tha
 Tenders have been issued for this smart pole, but due to some reason, the work of applying smart pole was not started at the ground level
 der se hi sahi lekin ab endiemasi ne tamaam mushkilon ko peeche chhodte hue aakhirkaar nai dilli ilaake main smart pole lagane kaa kaam shuru kar diya he, jisaki shuruyaat conot place se kii gai he
 Under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model, about 55 smart poles will be installed in the New Delhi area in the first phase
 in smart pols kii jimmedaari nijee company ko di gai he, jo agle paanch saalon tak smart pole kii dekharekh sanbhaalengi

 Lalu looks desperate in pictures

 Although Ramkripal was 'loud' but was 'loyal', examples of which are given
 baaki lalu ne kuch aise netaaon ko tikat diya he, jo namchin nahin hai or jinhen shaayad vittiya vajahon se tikat diya he
 In Madhepura, Lalu wants to give Pappu a ticket, which shows that both have bowed and are weakened
 paswan ke paala badalane se lalu kaa wo atirikt aatmavishvaas jameen par aa chukaa he, jo kuch din pehle tak dikhataa tha
 However, there are still strong candidates for contesting in the 40x50 sq km Lok Sabha constituency either with Lalu or with the BJP
 nitish kumaar ne pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bunon ko jagah di thi, taaki koi unke khilaaf aawaaj na uthaa sake
 Now Babusu is suffering his brunt
 gadhe vakt main sipaahi hi kamjor mil rahe hai
 As for the alliance between Lalu and Congress, Lalu does not want to share the stage with Congressmen
 lalu ko bhay he ki congressi netaaon ko dekhakar janata ko 2ji ghotaalaa yaad aa jayega or bijepi vaale ye bhi yaad dilaa denge ki congressiyon ne mahaan yaduwanshi sant baba ramdev kaa apmaan kiya tha
 
 
 Now Lalu is saying that we will not share the stage
 udhar congressi bhi aisa hi kah rahe hai
 The interesting thing is that the congress-lalu alliance is going on, but both know that where the Congress candidate will contest the election, the votes of the Yadavs can swing and go to the BJP
 asli maamla musalmaan votaron kaa he, jiske peeche lalu-congress pade hue hai
 In this election, if Lalu misses this golden opportunity to convert them into seats, the situation will become really serious for him

 Congress has fielded GB member GB Maltesh against Yeddyurappa from Shikarpura assembly seat in Chicago
 mana ja rahaa tha ki yediurppa ke saamne party kisi bade chehre par daanv lagaaegi

 BJP has fielded Yeddyurappa in Lingayat dominated Shikarpuras
 congress netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ko ummid thi ki yediurppa ke saamne kisi party kisi majboot lingayat netaa ko is seat se utaaregi
 Former MLA from this seat Mahalingappa was considered a strong contender for the ticket
 lekin party ne yediurppa ke khilaaf maltesh ko apana ummidavaar ghoshit kiya
 Let me tell you that Mahalingappa had defeated Yeddyurappa in 1999 by fighting a Congress ticket
 congress ke duusare daavedaaron main shanthavirappa gauda kaa naam tha
 Shantavirappa Gowda lost to Yeddyurappa's son Raghavendra by nearly 6 thousand votes in the 2014 by-elections

 The third name of Congress's ticket contenders was former Congress president Prasanna Kumar

 But the party also disappointed him
 mana ja rahaa he ki congress party ne shikarpura seat se maltesh ko utarkar yediurppa ke liye behad aasaan bana diya he
 Maltesh does not even come from the Lingayat community, he is a Qurba
 aise main lingayat bahul seat se yediurppa ke khilaaf kurba samudaay kaa ummidavaar utaara he
 It will be difficult to manage the backward castes and SC, ST votes in front of Yeddyurappa, walking Maltesh Qurba

 4 karod litre pratidin kshamta vaale sivej treetment plant kaa ek saath shilanyas kiya
 However, the interesting moment came when Modi government minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat at the event organized by the Delhi Jal Board, was seen staring at the posters congratulating the Delhi government on Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 jawaab main arvind kejariwal ko bhi kahana padaa ki aage se aisi galati nahin hogi
 Union Waterpower Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said that while coming from Noida today, he saw posters all over Delhi, in which Kejriwal government has given a lot of congratulations to the whole of Delhi
 mujhe khushi he ki dilli ko badhai dene kaa kejariwal sahab ko mauka mila lekin thodaa sa dhanyavad bharat sarkaar ko de dete kyonki is sivej treetment plant kaa 85% fund centre sarkaar hi de rahi he
 However, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal responded to the taunt of Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat with a very soft nature
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki 'aaj desh kaa sabase bada sivej treetment plant kaa shilanyas kiya ja rahaa he
 i sincerely thank the Central Government for this
 centre sarkaar is yojana main 85% fund de rahi he or saath hi sahyog ke liye centre ke shukraguzaar hai
 Shekhawat ji is right in saying that there were many posters with congratulatory messages on the way, they were also knocking me but today Delhi Jal Board program is there, then the officers of the board would have only seen the photo of the boss
 aage se is baat kaa khyaal rakhaa jaae
 The world will change when everyone does it together

 desh kii rajdhani main bacchon ke khilaaf aparaadh rukne kaa naam nahin le rahe
 On Sunday, the sensation spread as the body of an 11-year-old child was found in the bushes of a golf course in North West Delhi's Shalimar Bagh police station area
 police ne bhi tatparta dikhaate hue aaropee shaks ko giraftaar kar liya he
 However the DCP of North West Delhi definitely kept a distance from the media in this matter
 police ne bachche ke shav ko postmortem ke liye babu jagjivan ram aspataal bhej diya he or aaropee se poochtacha ja rahi he
 Police is trying to find out why the accused murdered the child
 aaropee akelaa tha yaa uske saath koi or bhi tha
 However, the reason behind the murder of the child remains a mystery
 police ne aaropee ke khilaaf pasco ke tahat maamla darj kar liya he
 Police suspect that the accused has misbehaved with the child
 police ne bataaya ki aaropee akelaa dilli main rahata he or mazdooree karata he
 Police said the child went missing on Saturday evening
 shalimaar baag main haidarpur nahar ke kinare mrit bachche kaa garib parivaar kiraye ke makaan main rahata he
 The child studying in the fourth class was playing outside the house with the other children of the locality
 tabhi nashe main dhut ek shaks ne bachche se dukaan se kuch saamaan mangavaya
 After this, he lured the child that he would get him some food items from the shop
 baccha laalach main aa gaya or us anjaan shaks ke saath jane laga
 Then the other children playing together ran away and told their family members that an uncle was taking his friend
 sabhi log daude lekin tab tak baccha gaayab tha
 Despite finding millions of householders, neither the child was found nor the person carrying it
 subah tak parijan bachche ko talashte rahe, lekin bachche kaa koi suraag nahin mila
 The family then complained to the police
 police ne duusare bachche ke bataae hulie ke aadhaar par ilaake main hi aaropee kii talash kii to jald hi vah nashe kii haalat main mil gaya
 When strictly questioned by the police, he confessed his crime and told that he killed the child and threw his body behind the bushes at the golf course located in Bhalswa dairy area
 darasal is golf course ground main kaaphi jhaad or jangal he
 Some guards on the golf course are posted by the government, but the guards remain inside
 jabaki kinare ug ai jhaadiyon or junglee ilaake main aasapaas ke sharaabi or nashedi ghoomte rahete hai
 Taking advantage of this, the addict easily killed the innocent and threw him there
 team annake himachal pradesh main banaae gaye lokayukta vidheyak kii aalochana kii he
 As a result, the Himachal Pradesh government canceled its meeting with Arvind Kejriwal, a key member of Team Anna
 kejariwal kii ore se himachal pradesh main banaae gaye lokayukta vidheyak kii aalochana kiye jane ke kaaran rajya sarkaar ne unase milane kaa kaarykram radd karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Kejriwal had said about the BJP that it seems that the saffron party and the Congress have a similar stand on the law
 kejariwal ne himachal ke lokayukta vidheyak ko ‘bahut kii kamjor or nishprabhavi’ qaraar diya tha or yah bhi sawaal kiya tha ki rajya main is tarah kaa vidheyak laakar kya bhaajapa uttarakhand main bhaajapa nit tatkaaleen sarkaar kii ore se isi saal laae gaye ‘majboot’ vidheyak ko asweekaar kar rahi he
 It was widely discussed that President Mahinda Rajapaksa had been dishonestly defeated in the last presidential elections of January 2015 in rural Sinhala areas
 bahut se logon kaa to maananaa tha ki rajpakshe ko srilanka kii satta se hataane kii sajeesh pashchimi shaktiyon ne rachi thi
 The effect of this sitting in the minds of the people is seen that the victory of Rajapaksa's party in the local elections held on February 10 was ensured
 chunaav parinaamon ne jahaan rajpakshe ko res main phir se sabase aage laa khadaa kiya he, vahiin gathbandhan sarkaar kii pehle se hi dagamagaati naiya ko tagada jhatka laga he
 Rajapaksa's party got around 45 per cent of the total votes cast, while Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's United National Party (UNP), the largest in Sri Lankan parliament, came second with around 33 per cent votes
 raashtrapati maitreepala sirisena kii party kaa pradarshan bahut kharaab rahaa
 They could collect only 15 percent of the vote
 haalanki sthaneey chunaavon main haar se sirisena sarkaar ko to koi khatra nahin he lekin logon kaa maananaa he ki ye chunaav sirisena or vikramsinghe kii gathbandhan sarkaar ke liye janamat surveykshan jaise hai
 The election has given an indication of what the public's stance might be in the upcoming parliamentary elections
 rajnatik vishleshak dayaan jayatilekaa ne likhaa ''unke rajnatik virdohi utane vajani nahin hai, jitne vajandaar raajnneeti ke ye mohammad ali hai
 "although Dayan has always been in favor of Rajapaksa, these election results have begun to signal a return to power of the party of the former president, who during his tenure wiped out the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
 is chunaav parinaam ne desh kii jansankhya ke kareeb 23 pratishat rahe 2
 The 10 million liberal Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim populations may have been a bit disappointed
 rajpakshe kaa kattar samarthak zyaadaatar sinhalai buddha samudaay he
 Rajavarothiam Sampanthan, leader of the opposition and head of the Tamil National Alliance, condemned the communal tactics adopted during Rajapaksa's election campaign
 rajpakshe ne chunaav prachaar ke dauraan logon se kaha tha ki yuanpi ke liye vot daalkar aap alag tamil rajya ke nirmaan kaa maarg prashast karenge
 He says, "this was a malicious, hateful and deceptive propaganda of Rajapaksa
 ''rajpakshe ke khilaaf maanavadhikaar ulanghan, bhai-bhatijawad, dhokhadhadi or bhrashtachar ke aaropon kii jhadi lag gai thi or unhen 2015 main satta chhodani padi
 People believed that Rajapaksa and his brothers were running an oppressive government together
 antarrashtriya dabaav, badhate karj or satta ke durupyog ko lekar janata main aakrosh ko dhyaan main rakhte hue rajpakshe ne apni sthiti majboot karne ke makasad se samay se purv raashtrapati chunaavon kii ghoshnaa kar di thi
 Sirisena, a minister and close ally of the Rajapaksa government, kept away from the discussion, was pitched by the opposition as a common candidate against Rajapaksa
 yah daanv lag gaya or tamil evam muslim votaron ke samarthan se sirisena raashtrapati chun liye gaye
 However, after the defeat of Rajapaksa, the UNP government fell prey to mutual ideological differences
 sirisena kii aguai vaali srilanka freedom party (esaffp) vampanthi rujhaan vaali party he jo rus or china ke saath gathbandhan karne or gutnirpeksh andolan ko aage badhaane kii baat karti he
 The UNP, which is inclined towards the west, is considered to be inspired by the right-wing ideology
 sirisena or vikramsinghe ek duusare se ekadam vipareet prishthbhumi se aate hai
 Sirisena is from the rural agricultural district of Polonnaruwa district while Vikramasinghe belongs to the rich family of Colombo
 donon ne ek saajha kaarykram kii ruparekha taiyaar kii thi jisamen rajpakshe dwaara videshon main chhupaakar rakhaa kalaadhan waapas laana, bhrashtachar par nakel kasnaa, maanavadhikaron ko phir se behaal karnaa or sashastr balon par lage yuddh aparaadh ke aaropon kii sunwaayee karana shaamil tha
 However, there was no success in cases of corruption charges against the people of the previous government and the cases were withdrawn
 iske alaava pradhanmantri ne apane jis bharosemand sahyogi ko central bank kaa garvanar banaaya, usee par apane damaad ke saath bond kii bikri se judi gopneey suchanaaen saajha karne ke aarope lage
 On this, Sirisena set up a Presidential Commission in front of which the Prime Minister had to appear as a witness
 isse sirisena or yuanpi ke sadasyon ke bich khatas bad gai or unhone sirisena par usee party ko bevajaah pareshaan karne kaa aarope lagaaya, jisane unhen raashtrapati banane main edi-chotii kaa jor lagaaya
 The controversial Port City project that Wickremesinghe had announced to be closed at the same time as his return to power, is moving ahead with full speed today, and it trumped Rajapaksa's promise to get rid of China-oriented policies Has gone
 puure chunaav prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan donon saajheedaar dalon ke bich kadavaahat saaf dikhti rahi
 Instead of targeting Rajapaksa, Sirisena kept blaming his coalition partners for corruption
 duusari taraf, yuanpi ke sadsy sirisena ko 'ehsaan faramosh' tehraate rahe
 The rising inflation, subsidy cuts on fertilizers and corruption charges leveled at the ministers have done well and created an atmosphere in favor of Rajapaksa
 desh kaa samvidhan kisi bhi vyakti ko do baar se adhik raashtrapati kaa chunaav ladgaye kii anumati nahin detaa isliye rajpakshe raashtrapati kaa chunaav nahin lard paaenge
 He is currently a member of Parliament and can become Prime Minister if he is able to win the majority
 2020 main raashtrapati chunaav or sansad chunaav honge
 If the mutual tussle between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe did not stop, Rajapaksa would not stop him

 After this, South Africa had won 2–0 and 1–0 in 1996–97 and 2001–02 respectively

 The Ram temple issue is slowly getting heated
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare shanivaar ko ayodhya pahunch rahe hai
 Hundreds of Shiv Sainiks have already reached there
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki shivasena is mudde par bijepi ko har taraf se gherna chaahati he
 The Shiv Sena has made it clear that it will not ask for votes in the name of Ram temple, but questions are also arising as to why Shiv Sena has remembered Lord Ram so much since 1992
 6 disambar 1992 ko babari masjid tod di gai thi or shivasena pramukh bal thakare ne aage aakar isaki jimmedaari lee thi
 He said that the demolition of Babri Masjid is a matter of pride for him
 aaj halaat aise ho chuke hai ki bijepi or shivasena saath hai lekin shivasena, bijepi ke khilaaf jehar ugalati rahati he
 Sometimes there is an attempt to show that the two will not contest together and their alliance will break in Maharashtra
 bijepi par dabaav banane kii koshish!raajnneetik jaankaron kaa kahana he ki shivasena dabaav banaakar bijepi ko baikfoot par laana chaahati he jisase bijepi se siton kaa samjhauta kiya ja sake
 If Uddhav gets a good response in Ayodhya, then he can also claim for seats in UP
 maharashtra main kabhi shivasena ko mukhyamantri kaa pad bhi mila tha lekin aaj ke halaat duusare hai
 The BJP has a Chief Minister in Maharashtra
 shivasena jis tarah se ram mandir ko lekar mukhar hui he usase kahin na kahin ye saaf he ki vah apni saathi party bijepi ke mudde ko hathiyaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Usually till now, BJP has been making Ram temple an issue and in 2014 it had won a big victory by making Ram temple an issue, but now it seems that the issue is of Shiv Sena
 khud uddhav thakare kaa ayodhya pahunchnaa yah darshata he ki vah bijepi ko is mudde par chhodane vaali nahin he or uske saath rahete hue bhi usko mandir ke liye chunauti detii rahegi
 Shiv Sena leader Arvind Sawant had said that the BJP had promised in 2014 to withdraw the Kashmir dispute, Article 370 and build a Ram temple in Ayodhya
 modi sarkaar ko chaar saal se zyada ho gaye hai lekin abhi nirmaan bhi shuru nahin ho paaya
 This matter is still in court
 babari masjid giraane kii koi jimmedaari nahin le rahaa tha
 Balasaheb Thackeray, the founder of Shiv Sena at that time, took responsibility for this
 balasaheb thakare ne kaha tha- babari girnaa gaurav kii batabata den ki 1993 main balasaheb thakare ne babari masjid girane ke baad ek intervyuu main kaha tha ki babari masjid girnaa gaurav kii baat thi, shame kii nahin
 The temple was under the mosque
 ham mandir ko upar le aae
 If you look at history, you will know that Babur or all the Muslim rulers who came to India, they demolished all our temples and built mosques
 hamaara kartavya he ki aisi masjidon ko giraakar mandiron ko upar laayaa jaae
 Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said that if we break the Babri in 17 minutes, how much time does it take to enact the law? There is a BJP government from Rashtrapati Bhavan to UP
 rajyasabha main aise bahut saansad hai, jo ram mandir ke saath khadey rahenge
 Who will resist, it will be difficult to move around the country
 'sarkaar sansad main kanoon banaemodi sarkaar jab apane kaarykaal ke aakhri varsh main he to shivasena aksar bijepi ko uske vaade kii yaad dilaati rahi he
 The Shiv Sena has demanded legislation in Parliament to build a grand Ram temple
 shivasena ke mutabik ayodhya main ram mandir kaa maamla court ke madhyam se hal nahin ho saktaa
 People will not accept the court's decision, because it is a matter related to faith
 aise main ayodhya main ram mandir banane ke liye centre sarkaar ko sansad main kanoon bananaa chahie
 Shiv Sena says that if the government enacts a law in Parliament to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya, the Shiv Sena will fully support the government

 5 Stardirector: Rola emrichcolor: Liam Hemsworth, Jeff Goldblum, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Bill Pullman, Myka Monroe, Travis Topp, and Jude Hershollywood also often make mistakes they don't expect
 1996 main aliens ke dharti par hamale ko lekar ek film ai thi independence de
 The Alien attack shown in the film and the story related to it won everyone's heart
 film ne box offis par acha collection kiya tha or apni pahchaan banaai thi
 Its producers have brought the sequel after twenty years
 lekin yah sikval kahani se lekar har maamle tak main niraash karata he
 Director Roland Amrich, who made great films like Universal Soldier (1992), Independence Day (1996), Godzilla (1998) and 2012 (2009), has missed this time
 unhone film kaa sikval to banane kaa faisla kar liya lekin film ke liye unke paas koi thos kahani nahin thi, or koi aisa eks factor bhi nahin tha jiske saath ve aliens ko lekar kuch nayaa kar pate
 And overall they brought a very boring, repetitive weak sequel
 kahani kuch is tarah heki pehle alian atake ko bees saal ho chuke hai
 After recovering from the first attack, all the countries of the world together have formed Earth Space Defense and Area 51 has become the headquarters of space security
 atyaadhunik or aliens kii technology ke jariye ab antariksh main awajahi aasaan ho gai he or hathiyaar bhi badal gaye hai
 With this, the President of America has become a woman
 lekin is sabake bich duniya par phir se aliens kaa khatra mandaraane laga he
 There are various indications and as scientist Jeff Goldblum goes to gather information about this, he meets another scientist Charlotte Gainsbourg (antichrist and Nymphomaniac)
 phir vahi sab shuru ho jaataa he jo pehle part main hua tha
 Aliens return to Earth with full force and start destroying cities of many countries of the world like London and America
 phir vahi puraani kahani shuru ho jaati he jo independence de main najar ai thi
 But she was new at the time and said differently
 shaayad diarector yah bhul gaye
 He gave the same story to the same beans, making only the difference to change the character
 baaki sab kuch vaisaa hi rahe
 The old type of Alien and Kahani seems boring because of no connection point
 jeff goldblm or sharlat jaise sadhe hue kalakaar bhi film main koi asar nahin daate pate
 It is also forced to think about what Emrich needed to make a sequel to the film with such a weak plot
 independence kul milakar kahani ke plot se lekar treetment or technology tak har maamle main niraash hi karti he
 It is called, elevated name and faded work
 bijepi netaa nitin gadakari ke aapraadhik manahani cese main AAP sanyojak arvind kejariwal ke khilaaf aarope tay ho gaye hai
 The court has framed charges under sections 499 and 500 of IPC
 agar aarope sabit hue, to kejariwal ko 2 saal kii jail ho sakati he
 The Patiala court has fixed the next hearing of the case on August 2
 isse pehle, nitin gadakari manahani maamle main arvind kejariwal ne bayaan waapas lene se inkaar kar diya
 Both Kejriwal and Nitin Gadkari reached Patiala House Court on Friday
 yah pehla mauka he jab is cese main donon netaa ek saath court main pesh hue
 In court, Nitin Gadkari said that Kejriwal would have to withdraw his statement but Kejriwal flatly denied it
 adaalat ne donon se kaha he ki ve jald se jald apana jhagadaa khatm karen
 Full details of the proceedings of the court told Gadkari: If you want, you can end this difference
 aap donon rajaneta hai, apana samay achche kaamon main lagaaein
 Gadkari: If Kejriwal withdraws his statement then i am ready to withdraw the case
 jajaikya aap donon sulah nahin sakate? gadakari ji aap to chunaav bhi jeet chuke hai
 Forget the old things
 gadakarimaine manish tiwari ke khilaaf bhi aisi hi shikaayat kii thi
 He apologized and i withdrew the case
 darasal, mere paas mere credit ke alaava kuch bhi nahin
 These allegations have shocked my image
 main maafee maangane kii bhi baat nahin kar rahaa
 If Kejriwal withdraws his statement then i will withdraw the case
 jaj ne kejariwal se kahayaap to ek agenda ke saath raajnneeti main aae the
 In which direction did he get caught? The whole world is watching you both
 sabake saamne ek udhaaharan pesh kiijie
 It is not a question of respect
 agar aapke paas saboot he to cese karen
 But what is the need to make such statements in the media? Kejriwal: i have no personal enmity with Nitin Gadkari
 gadakaringar kejariwal maafee nahin maangate to mujhe koi fark nahin padataa
 i am only concerned about whether he withdraws his statement or not
 main kejariwal ji kii izzat karata hum
 But as a politician i have nothing but respect
 kejarivalismain apana bayaan waapas nahin luungaa
 After this, lawyers of Nitin Gadkari told the court that this statement is not satisfactory
 aaj kii kaarywahi main court ne donon netaaon ko ise izzat kaa mudda na banane kii salaah di
 Asked both to reconcile
 jiske jawaab main gadakari kaa kahana tha ki yah unke liye sammaan kaa mudda he vahiin kejariwal ne kaha ki unki ladaai bhrashtachar ke khilaaf he

 congress ne pradhanmantri narendra modi par kedarnath yatra ke dauraan paramparaon kaa ‘anadar’ karne or 2013 kii baadh ke baad mandir ke punarnirmaan kaary ke bare main logon ko ‘gumraah’ karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 The party claimed that his visit was planned keeping the Gujarat elections in mind and it reflected his pride as he was back towards the temple of Lord Shiva when he was addressing the people and he was' Were wearing Italian glasses
 ’ party ne kaha ki modi ne maa ganga ko tabhi yaad kiya jab vah varanasi se chunaav lard rahe the or ab vah gujarat chunaav ke pehle bhagwaan shiv ke mandir gaye
 Congress's Communications Department in-charge Randeep Surjewalane alleged, "modi has disrespected our tradition and culture by making a platform just outside the main entrance of Kedarnath and giving a speech back to Lord Shiva
 ’ unhone yah bhi kaha, ‘narendra modi ne bhagwaan shiv ke saamne jhooth bolaa
 Modi forgot to tell you that the Congress government at the Center had given a package of Rs 6,000 crore for Kedarnath in 2013
 ’’ congress pravaktaa arpyen singh ne daawa kiya ki kedarnath ke punarvikas ke liye kuch bhi karne yaa 2013 kii baadh ke dauraan logon ko bachaane kaa gujarat ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri ke rup main modi kaa koi ricard nahin he
 Reacting to Modi's claim of not being allowed by the Congress government for the reconstruction of the temple as the Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2013, Singh said, "it is unfortunate that arrogance was reflected in his address in Kedarnath
 ’ pradhanmantri par rajya ke logon ko gumraah karne kaa aarope lagaate hue unhone kaha ki jab vah haadasa hua tha, centre kii tatkaaleen upie sarkaar ne punarvaas kaary ke liye ek samiti gathit kii thi or 8,000 karod rupe raahat ke liye manjuur kiye the
 Talking to reporters, Singh claimed that Rs 2200 crore had been released at the same time and not a single penny was released by the Modi government in the last three years
 surajevaala nepiem narendra modise avasarwaad kii raajnneeti se dur rahane kaa aagrah kiya or gujarat chunaavon ke dauraan mat hasil karne ke liye dharmik bhavanaaen bhadakaane or dhruvikaran ke prayaas karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 He said, "when a ruler becomes arrogant, his downfall comes to a close
 ’’ unhone pradhanmantri se aagrah kiya ki vah rajya ke logon kaa anadar nahin karen or kaha ki bhagwaan shiv kisi se madad nahin maangate balki shraddha maangate hai
 Let us tell you that during the Kedarnath Yatra, PM Narendra Modi had attacked the previous Congress-led UPA government and alleged that the then Central Government did not let him do the reconstruction work after the 2013 floods
 aapako bataa den ki us samay modi gujarat ke mukhyamantri the
 In this country, there has been a ruckus about fakat koran statements, learn the game of allegations, this game is a big price business
 piyush pandey kii rachana dhandhe maataram dhandhe ko nae rup main paribhaashit karti he
 The business is its own life which burns its life in the dead, no matter what the business is
 dharm or jati ko lekar jo badi-badi daleelein dete hai ve bhi jab apane-apane kaaryakshetra main vaada khilaaphi karte hai tab vande maataram bahut peeche rah jaataa he or dhandhe maataram kii jeet hoti he
 Piyush has made it clear through an insane meeting that people have made religion, caste, nation-constitution, business
 or jab dhandha hi bana diya he to bolo dhandhe maataram
 There is no right to speak Vande Mataram
 " a se ashishnutaa, aa se aatanvaad main piyush ne raajnneeti par bada sateek vyangy kiya he
 Politics may be called dirty but this business makes a big success
 vipaksh ko kaise aaropon ke ghere main khadey karen or sansad ko chalane hi naa den
 Even if national issues are asked to refute false allegations, the business of our politics should be maintained
 lekhak ne rajaneta banane ke icchhukon ke liye nayaa kakehara bhi taiyaar kiya he
 The author's view of satire is quite different
 piyush ko vyangy ke sarokaaron kii gahari samaj he
 How a sentence "good days will come" was thrown out by the opponents, ignoring all progress
 piyush ne ek vaakya ke madhyam se hindustani trainon ke kahin samay par naa pahunchane par bhi vyangy kar diya he
 Good days will come but Indians have gone astray like trains
 cheekh pukaar karke sansad ko naa chalane dena or loktantr kii hatya kaa naaraa lagane waalon kii maansikta ko ujagar kiya gaya he ki jwalanth samasyaon se dhyaan hataanaa kya vastav main loktantr kii hatya nahin he
 Is Dhande Mataram paramount
 dengue machhar hamaari kutsit maansikta kaa pratik he
 Human being bites human being and is proud of his actions
 thik hi kaha piyush ne " ganda he par dhandha he " sarkarein badalati rahati hai par berogari kii samasya jyon kii tyon munh baae khadi he
 Whole promises do not matter
 yuva har kshetra main aage aaen to " nagin dance ko bachaana he " ki tarah yuvaaon ko hataasha se baahar nikaal laaenge or rajnatik dalon ke ghoshnaa patr sirf voter ko ullu banane tak simit nahin rahenge
 They have to fulfill the promises
 kitni sahajata se vyakt kar diya he piyush ne ki apana ullu sidhaa karne ke liye kaise ham sab jaanate samajhate hue bhi ullu kaa aavaran odhe rahete hai
 It has demonstrated a sarcastic view and description of what gimmick should be done to remain popular
 " holi kanhaiya kii ho lee 
 
 
 "piyush has explained the anomalies of society very easily
 rosemara kii ghatnaon main se vyangy ke vishay khoj lenaa piyush ke boote kii baat he
 Whether it is Baba or a politician, the situation is more or less the same
 dhong rachane main donon maahir
 Dusting in the eyes is a game of his left hand
 kaise bhakton kii bheed inhen farsh se arsh tak pahunchaati he aundhe munh gir bhi paden to inhen koi fark nahin padataa kyonki yah apane dhandhe main maahir hai
 Piyush has also brought the pain of being a common man
 man ko jhakzor detii hai kuch anubhutiyaan ki ham kaise nirih par to bekasoor hone par bhi tut padate hai par kathor waar hone par bhi ucch varg kii ore aankh bhi nahin uthaate
 The show is in our veins
 ham daan bhi dete hai to dikhaave ke liye isiilie use you tub par bhi daal dete hai
 Politics is a quagmire
 ek bada bangala or chapaluson kaa jamaavada yahi he pahchaan jan-jan ke nayak kii
 The blank promises, the new temptations, the man who gets trapped in the net, what he gets, the same three parts of Dhaka
 piyush kii rachana man ko jhakzorti, desh kii, samaaj kii sachai se hamen rubaru karaati he
 Business is paramount for us no matter what it is
 virodh kii raajnneeti bahut jor pakad rahi he
 If not opposition then what is politics baat chaahe swatchta abhiyaan kii ho yaa sampatti vivaran kii ho
 Opposing every good thing is our birthright
 ham aadi hai manamaani karne ke
 In the first manifesto of the election, there are big promises that, after meeting the needs of the poor, the poor remains there and politicians become more rich
 yahi he desh kii vidambnaa
 Best wishes to Piyush for his satire collection Dhandhe Mataram, as soon as reading, questions will arise in the minds of the readers and i believe that the situation of the society and the country will move in front of their naines like a movie
 sangrah main kai bade gambhir vishay hai jinpar piyush kii lekhnee chali he vyangyatmak rup main
 Language is common hence dominant
 janamanas kaa aakrosh bhi ubharkar saamne aayaa he par sahaj or vyangyatmak rup main
 Piyush's collection will definitely make him think on social concerns

 5 finlist main se 1 ke sir par big-bos kaa taj sajega
 Let us know which of the five finalists is the chance to win
 ali kuli mirza:ek wild card entry ke taur par big bos ke ghar main kadam rakhaa or tarah-tarah ke rup dikhaakar sabhi kaa manoranjan karte rahe
 The worst thing for Ali is that till date no wild card entry has been seen becoming the winner of Bigg Boss
 ab kya is baar bhi yahi pratha jari rahegi, yaa badlaav aayega?dimpi mahajan:dimpi, jinaki aawaaj ke charche chaaron taraf faile hue hai, kabhi ladaaiyon main unka haath to kabhi jor-jor se rokar logon kaa samarthan hasil karnaa
 Dimpy also has fewer chances as he is also a wild card entry
 preetam:pehle din se sabhi ke fevorett rahe preetam ek majboot pratiyogi hai or vijeta banane ke chance bhi kaaphi hai
 He also had to listen a lot due to not being able to keep his side for a little in 2-3 weeks in between
 lekin uske baad phir se trek par vaapis laut aae hai preetam
 Now on the night of Finale it will be interesting to see if Pritam becomes the winner or not
 karishma tanna:eklauti strang mahila pratiyogi hai
 From the first day, sometimes because of his general knowledge, sometimes selfish nature remained a topic of discussion
 abhi haal hi main unke or upain patel ke ishk vaale lamhon ko bhi puure desh kii janata ne dekha
 Now after giving so much spice, we think that perhaps the people of the country should try to make them winners
 gautam gulati:gautam gulati jinhen farah khan ne 'gullu' naam diya he, apni body ke saath-saath acting ke liye bhi big bos ke ghar main kaaphi charchit ho chuke hai
 According to speculation, it is probably the biggest contestants to become Bigg Boss winners
 pehle din se aakhri raat tak gautam ne sabhi ko apni kala or vyavhaar ke dam par prerit kiya he
 But it has been seen that the most powerful contestant in the last season has been getting the title of winner
 ab kya gautam banenge vijeta yaa phir se itihaas doharaaya jayega
 The night of finale will be known
 kuch media reports ke mutabik, chhotepur ke kareebi unhen 'shadyantr kaa shakar' bataa rahe hai', vahiin kuch vipakshi netaa bataate hai ki 'unki kejariwal se zyaada ban nahin rahi thi'
 In such a situation, now the party's action against him has intensified the speculation that he can leave the party and go with his old partner Amarinder Singh

 In such a situation, Kejriwal and his party will have to find the cut of Chotipur on 24 seats of Majha, which seems to be crooked at the moment

 com / xpq89f2p0u aam aadmi party ke dilli ke timarpur se baagi vidhayak pankaj pushkar ne ek baar phir kejariwal sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa
 a 2-day session of the Delhi Legislative Assembly was called, for which questions were raised about his own party
 pankaj pushkar ne kaha ki vidhansabha satr ko nagar nigam chunaavon kii taiyaari ke liye sirf istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Where more than the Question Hour, the assembly is made an arena for accusations and counter charges
 is baar bhi 17 janvari ko prashnkaal sirf 20 minute kaa hua
 Whereas the discussion about the municipal corporation lasted for 2 hours and made the people of Delhi football
 unhone kaha ki 2 din ke notice par satr bulaayaa jaataa he
 Departmental officers get 3 days time to prepare the answer to the question
 sawaalon ke uttar aadhe-adhure, aspashtataa or uljhaav bhare milte hai
 The assembly is lied to, the truth is hidden
 prashnkaal jo vidhayika kii sarvocchata ko sthapit karne kaa aujaar he, use khanaapurti main badal diya gaya he
 There would not have been even 5 such occasions in two years when a question period of sufficient duration has been kept in the Delhi Legislative Assembly
 ullekhneey he ki prashnkaal hi vah avasar he jab mantrimandal ko janpratinidhiyon ke sawaalon kaa jawaab anivaary rup se dena padataa he
 The Delhi Legislative Assembly has the experience that the Delhi government protects its cabinet as if it were milking children
 yahi vajah he ki prashnkaal hote hi nahin or agar hote bhi hai to aadhe-adhure

 In such a situation, the question of who will be the new finance minister is becoming important
 is sawaal par sabase zyada nazar bazaar kii he
 Pranab Mukherjee's legacy as finance minister is fraught with challenges
 enditivi se khaas baatcheet main vaanijya mantri anansh sharma ne mana ki desh aarthik sankat se jujh rahaa he
 According to him, the industry is disappointed
 audyogic utpaadan girtaa ja rahaa he or vaataavaran kharaab ho rahaa he
 After Pranab's departure, it is believed that the Prime Minister himself will keep the command of the Finance Ministry for a few days
 lekin vitt mantralay jaise baari−bharkam mahakme kaa kaam ek alag or phulatime mantri ke bina lambey samay tak nahin chalanaa he
 Anyway, the government is accused that it is not able to make important financial decisions and is repeatedly failing to deal with policy paralysis
 is vajah se kai ahm prastaav atake pade hai
 Some of the important proposals on which the government has to decide are major proposals like pension, insurance and FDI in multi-brand retail sector
 maujuuda bajet main pichhali tarikh se lagu hone vaale kar prastaavon se niveshak naaraaz hai
 Direct tax code and GST are stuck

 chote−majhole udyogon ko aasaan sharton par lone milanaa chaiye or pension or insurance sector main epadiai laane or badhaane ke liye pahal kerani chahie
 Talking to NDTV, he said that the time has come that the Prime Minister himself should take initiative to address the concerns of the industry so that the negative sentiment in the market improves
 siaiai ke secretary general chandrajit banerjee bhi maanate hai ki maujuuda paristhiti main sarkaar or industry main slodown ko manage karne ke liye talmail zaruri he
 But the difficulty is that the new initiative is important not only on the political fronts
 upie main sahmati na hone kii vajah se multi−brand retail sector main 51 videshi nivesh kaa prastaav maheenon se atka padaa he
 Most of the opposition is coming from West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee
 jab enditivi india ne anand sharma se is bare main poocha to unhone iske liye bijepi ko zimmedaar bataa diya or aarope lagaaya ki bijepi is mudde par dohari niti apana rahi he
 The comments anand sharma kaa daawa he ki jab sarkaar multi−brand retail sector main videshi nivesh kii niti taiyaar kar rahi thi us dauraan unhone koi aitraaj nahin jataayaa
 But after the policy was announced, they started opposing it
 unka daawa he ki bahut saare rajya iske paksh main hai
 But if the majority is in its favor, then why is the government not moving forward? kyon baar−baar koshish ke baavjood trinmul netaa mamata banerjee ko manaane main sarkaar naakaam sabit ho rahi he
 Industry is troubled by the declining economic growth rate
 bade faisle lene main ho rahi deree kii vajah se bazaar main centiment girtaa ja rahaa he
 Now the industry wants that the time has come to take tough decisions and the new finance minister of the country will have to take an early step in this regard

 Oval Test: Challenging India to save the match on the fifth day Overcoming lack of consistency in South Africa and then personal problems, Shami bowled effectively in the current series against England, taking 16 wickets in 5 Tests

 Overall we all did well

 i was not even mature
 is baar maine james anderson or stuart broad ke gendbaaji karte hue video dekhe
 i saw where they bowled under these conditions
 mujhe kaaphi seekhney ko mila
 The fast bowler bowled brilliantly in both the innings of the fifth and final Test, but success was far from him
 shami pehali pari main 72 ran dekar ek bhi wicket hasil nahin kar paae, jabaki duusari pari main unhone 110 ran dekar do wicket chatkaaye
 England gave India a target of 464 runs to win

 Of course, it is frustrating that despite hitting the batsman several times, he did not get a wicket, but it does not matter
 allaah mujhe jo kuch bhi degaa, mujhe vah sweekaar he
 The Indian team had to bowl without Ishant Sharma on the fourth day, who walked out of the ground due to an ankle injury after throwing just one over

 He said, 'if you have less one bowler, then the situation becomes difficult, especially in these situations when you have to bowl as a fast bowler

 *** Due to his involvement in social service, people often used to visit the house of well-known businessman and philanthropist Bajranglal Bokadia, but till Monday morning, when a neighbor knocked in his house, the murder of Bokadia Sahab happened
 65 saal ke is buzurg kaarobaari kaa katl kaatilon ne unheen ke ghar main ghus kar galaa ret kar kiya tha
 But there was not the only incident of murder in the house, but three more dead bodies were found here along with Bokadia and the remaining people were the drivers of Bokadia and two servants
 sabhi ke sabhi laashon par maujuud jakhm ke nishaan is baat kii taraf ishaara kar rahe the ki sabhi kaa katl galaa ret kar hi kiya gaya
 While the body of Bokadia was found in a sitting position on the chair of his dining table, the bodies of the remaining three people were scattered in the drawing and dining space
 bokadiya ke donon haath kursi se bandhe hue the
 Police reached the spot after the murder and found that the sadar door of their house was broken, while all the things in the house were scattered
 bokadiya ke parivaar main unki patni ke alaava ek betaa or ek beti hai, jinaki shaadi ho chuki thi or kuch roj pehle hi ghar ke duusare log kisi kaam se mumbai gaye the lekin isse pehle ki ve laut kar aate, bokadiya sahab kaa katl ho gaya
 In fact, when a neighbor who came to his house in the morning did not get any response from inside, despite ringing the doorbell and making a noise, he informed some others but despite the efforts of all the neighbors, the door of the Bokadia residence did not open
 , Then people thought it better to call the police
 police maukey par pahunch chuki thi
 The door of the house was opened, but seeing the inside view, the minds of the uniformed people also wandered for some time
 ghar ke drawing-dining room main ek saath chaar logon kii laashen padi thim
 While the body of elderly Bokadia Sahab was tied to a chair, the bodies of his driver and two servants were lying down
 puraa ghar bikharaa hua tha or sadar darwaja tutaa hua, jo is baat kii taraf ishaara kar rahaa tha ki vaardaat kaa makasad lutpaat bhi ho saktaa he
 However, it was also possible that the murderers, after carrying out the incident for some other purpose, may have scattered the household items to confuse the police or they had raided the house of Bokadia in search of something special
 behad milansaar or khushmizaaj bokadiya plastic kaa kaarobaar karte the or unka kaaphi vakt logon kii madad karne main gujarata tha
 His brother called him on his mobile phone to talk to him at around 5
30 pm on Sunday evening, but he did not pick up the phone then
 iske baad raat 11 baje ke aas-paas unke bhai ne dobaaraa unhen phone kiya, lekin tab bhi phone nahin uthaa jabaki bokadiya kabhi phone nahin uthaane par dobaaraa kol jarur karte the
 His brother had started worrying about him since then, but his brother did not think so bad about him
 vaise ek saath chaar logon ke qatl kii ye vaardaat apane-aap main kaaphi rahasyamayi he kyonki bokadiya kaa makaan main road par he or ghar ke thik saamne police picket bhi
 Policemen often guard a picket from the house of Bokadia
