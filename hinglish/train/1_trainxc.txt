 (agency se input) Even though recently the High Court has given its sharp remarks on caste politics, Delhi BJP has made a new strategy this time to make a dent in the caste vote bank of Congress

 amejan apane products ko sil container mennadi, talab, jhil, pool or aadi jagahon main store karegaa or ise tab hi sataha par laayaa jayega jab product kisi customer ko pahunchaaya janaa ho
 The patent revealed that the products would be placed in sealed containers and dropped in the reservoir through parachutes, trucks or conveyor belts
 har container ek vishesh tarah ke acustic signal se tun kiya jayega
 When the correct tone is played, the attached air bladder will float and thus the package will come to the surface
 iske baad product ko pick kar liya jayega or delivery trek main lod kar diya jayega
 However, no information has been revealed at this time about whether or not the company will use this storage
 saath hi amejan puri tarah se warehouse kaa istemaal band nahin karegaa

 chhattisgarh main 19 november ko duusare or antim charan kaa chunaav nipatane ke saath hi kathith taur par li hui ek chitthee bahut charchaa main he
 This letter refers to the so-called 'plan' of the Congress
 chitthee saamne aane se rajya main raajnneetik khalabali much gai
 According to this letter, which is being shared widely on social media, the plan of the Congress is that if it comes to power, the benefits of loan waiver to the farmers will be reduced
 chitthee main daawa kiya gaya he ki ye congress padaadhikariyon kii li hui aantarik baatcheet par aadhaarit he
 However, the party is saying exactly the opposite in its public rallies, which is being claimed in the letter being shared with the name of Congress for debt waiver of farmers
 kisaanon kii karjamaafee chhattisgarh vidhansabha chunaav main is baar bada mudda he
 Every political party wants to cash in on this issue to woo voters
 ek news agency report ke mutabik, 17 november ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne chhattisgarh ke korea jile main ek chunavi raily main vaada kiya tha ki ‘agar rajya main congress satta main ai to party 10 din main kisaanon kaa karj maaf kar degi or ye paisa vijay maalya, neerav modi or anil ambani jaison ke paas se aayega
 'in such a situation, the claims made in the viral letter are completely contrary to the promises made by none other than the Congress President himself
 india today fact check team ne apni padtaal main chitthee ko farji paaya
 There is many such evidence in the letter itself which proves it to be fake
 chitthee ko chhattisgarh main matdaan shuru hone se pehle tak soshal media par dhadlle se share kiya ja rahaa tha
 When we searched the keywords related to the content of the letter on Facebook, we got many responses on this issue
 padtaal kii shuruyaat main hi chitthee main kuch badi galtiyaan dikhin
 First thing, it is not clear to whom the letter was written
 duusari baat, ise teen logon ko CC kiya gaya tha lekin jis shaks ke liye ise likhaa gaya, usee kaa naam chitthee se nadaarad he
 The letter cites 6 points regarding loan waiver of farmers
 lekin chitthee ke aakhir main likhaa gaya he ki ‘neeche likhe’ binduon ko dhyaan main rakhaa janaa chahie
 However, it should have been written in the letter that the 'above' points should be kept in mind
 raajnneetik dalon kii aupchaarik chitthiyon main is tarah kii galtiyaan sambhav hai lekin ye kabhi-kabhaar hi hoti hai
 We contacted Shailesh Nitin Trivedi, general secretary of the Chhattisgarh Congress Committee
 trivedi ke latter had par hi ye chitthee likhi gai thi
 Trivedi claimed that he had never used a letter head in the last 36 years
 unhone chitthee kii anya kai galatiyon kii ore bhi ishaara kiya
 Trivedi said that the signatures at the end of the letter are not his
 trivedi ke mutabik ye dastakhat chhattisgarh congress ke ek or padaadhikari girish devangan ke hastakshar se milte julate hai
 We looked into the letter and found that the signatures below the letter actually appear to match the signature of Girish Dewangan and not Trivedi
 trivedi or devangan, donon ke hastakshar is pulisashikayatkarj maafee par farji patr main dekhe ja sakate hai
 Both of these complaints have been lodged against this fake letter
 chitthee main trivedi kaa pataa bhi galat diya gaya he
 This address has been given to 'kharora village, Raipur'

 How do black cat commandos, who are called the most brave soldiers of the country, become? This question is always in everyone's mind because whenever the elite NSG commandos of the country run operations against terror, then everyone trusts them and people think that from which furnace these commandos come out
 aaj ham aapako bataate hai ki ek enesji kaa blike cat commando kaise banataa he taaki wo oparation ke dauraan apane kaam me peeche na hate iske liye in blike cat commando kaa manovaigyanik test bhi hota he
 So first of all know how a NSG commando is prepared
 commandos kii trennig bahut hi kathin hoti he jiskaa sabase bada makasad yah hota he ki adhik se adhik yogya logon kaa chayan ho sake
 In the same way, elections for the Commandos Force also take place in several stages
 sabase pehle jin rangaruton kaa commandos ke liye chayan hota he, vah apni-apni forcej ke sarvshereshth sainik hote hai
 Even then, they are selected through several stages
 ant main ye sainik training ke liye manesar enesji ke training centre pahunchate hai
 So it is the most valuable and brave soldiers of the country but it is not necessary that even after reaching the training center, a soldier finally becomes a commando
 90 din kii kathin training ke pehle bhi ek hafte kii aisi training hoti he jisamen 15-20 fisadi sainik antim daud tak pahunchane main rah jate hai
 But after this, the soldiers who survive and if they have completed 90 days of training efficiently then they become the most powerful commandos of the country
 ye commando sabase aakhir main manovaigyanik test se guzarate hai jise paas karnaa anivaary he
 On the lines of the SPG, the test NSG is now considering the nsg's psychological test on the lines of the SPG
 abhi enesji DRDO ke tahat taiyaar kiye gaye manovaigyanik test ke jariye har teen maheene main training se paas hone vaale 700 se 1000 commando ko gujaarta he
 But the SPG commandos guarding the Prime Minister of India and other vvips undergo computerized psychological tests through the VIENNA TEST SYSTEM
 iske jariye zyada stick nattejey aane kii ummid rahati he
 Due to this, now the NSG is also taking this step to make itself state-of-the-art
 isi makasad se ab enesji main javaanon kaa sateek manovaigyanik test lene ke liye VIENNA TEST SYSTEM laane par vichaar kar rahi he
 Coming from here, commandonsg is formed by sorting out specific soldiers from various forces in India
 enesji main 53 pratishat commando sena se aate hai jabaki 47 pratishat commando 4 paramilitary forcej- siarpief, itibipi, areef or biguef se aate hai
 The maximum work of these commandos is up to five years
 paanch saal bhi sirf 15 se 20 pratishat ko hi rakhaa jaataa he, baaki conmados ke teen saal ke puure hote hi unhen unki mul forcej main waapas bhej diya jaataa he

 dilli or uske aas paas pichley kuch arase se chorni gang ne aise naak main dam kar rakhaa tha, ki dukaan ho yaa factory, har jagah chorni kaa ye gang apane haathon kaa kamaal dikhaakar gaayab ho jaataa tha
 If used to remain, then just pictures of his antics captured in CCTV
 lekin ek samajhadaar dukandaar kii sooyeeboojh ne is shaatir gang kaa tilism aakhirkaar tod hi diya
 Date: 05 November 2014 Around two o'clock in the afternoon, like a saree shop in Madipur area, this shop of saree and suit was going to the customers
 dopaher ke vakt teen mahila graahak dukaan main daakhil hoti hai
 As soon as two of them enter the shop, they confuse the shop owner and his staff on the pretext of asking for the price of saree and suit
 jabaki teesri mahila dukaan main rakhi saadiyon par nazaren gada detii he
 After seeing the saris for a while, the three of them, without buying anything, turn the door as soon as they turn to the door to go to the shop
 dukaan kaa maalik pehle to counter par rakhi saadiyon ko dekhtaa he or phir unheen mahilaon ke saamne dukaan main lage sisitivi kii footage khangaalane baith jaataa he
 CCTV caught Choriani: In CCTV, he starts seeing everything he feared

 Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has accepted Navjot Singh Sidhu's resignation on Saturday
 ek adhikari ne yahaan bataaya ki siddhu kaa istipha punjab ke rajyapal veepi singh badnaur ko bhej diya gaya he
 Sidhu resigned from the Punjab cabinet after which his resignation was accepted
 is saptaah dilli aae singh ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki vah chandigarh pahunchakar patr ke binduon par gaur karne ke baad hi siddhu ke istife par faisla lenge
 The Chief Minister returned to Chandigarh on Wednesday evening
 siddhu kaa mukhyamantri se takaraav chal rahaa tha or unhen chah june ko hue mantrimandal pherbadal main ahm mantralayon se dur rakhaa gaya
 He made public his resignation from the state cabinet on June 10 while addressing the Congress president on Twitter
 is saptaah kii shuruyaat main amarinder ne kaha tha ki agar cricketer se netaa bane siddhu apana kaam nahin karnaa chaahate hai to vah kuch nahin kar sakate
 Sidhu said on July 15 that he had sent his resignation to Amarinder
 mukhyamantri ne chah june ko siddhu se sthaneey sarkaar or paryaton evam samskruti maamalon kaa vibhaag le liya tha or unhen bijli tathaa naveen evam navinikaran urja vibhaag de diya tha
 Sidhu and his wife Navjot Kaur kept a distance from the media only after the portfolios were changed
 singh or unke mantri ke bich tanaav pichley maheene tab jagajaahir ho gaya tha jab mukhyamantri ne siddhu par sthaneey sarkaar vibhaag ko sanbhaalane main akushalta kaa aarope lagaate hue daawa kiya tha ki isaki vajah se loksabhaa chunaavon main shahari ilaakon main congress ne kharaab pradarshan kiya
 Sidhu, however, said his department was publicly targeted
 unhone kaha tha ki unhen halke main nahin liya ja saktaa kyonki unhone hameshaa acha pradarshan kiya he
 Seeing the election coming to a head, the Vasundhara government of Rajasthan has now started playing the caste card
 mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne ghoshnaa kii he ki ab rajasthan main jatiyon or samaajon ke naam par sarkaar bhawan banavaayegi
 The state government will give 80 percent of the money for buildings based on caste and 20 percent will be spent by organizations of caste and society
 sarkaar ke jatigat aadhaar par bhawan banane ke is faisle kii kirakiri hone se bachane ke liye sarkaar ne ek gali nikaali he
 It stipulates that such caste-based social institutions will have to give an affidavit that whatever community building will be built on the basis of caste, other castes will also be allowed to use it
 rajya sarkaar isko banane main 80 fisadi paise degi us paisa ko jutaney ke liye 30 fisadi paisa sthaneey nikaay denge or 50 fisadi hissaa sidhe rajya sarkaar degi
 The government says that this will give relief to those caste societies which do not have enough money to build their own buildings
 rajasthan main jatigat aadhaar par samaajon ko riyayati jameen aavanton karne kii ravaayat rahi he
 In such a situation, the government says that allotment is done on caste and social basis, but many times society does not have money to build a building
 gauratlab he ki pichhali baar ashok gahalot ne sarkaar ke aakhri dinon main jatigat aadhaar par samaajon ko jameen aavanton karne kii jhadi laga di thi
 However, soon after coming to power, BJP had stopped them all saying that the government has taken all this action in the process of votes
 ab chunaav ko 4 maheene bache hai aise main vasundhara sarkaar ne bhi jatigat aadhaar par un sabhi samaajon ko jameen aavantit kar di he
 Now, going one step ahead of the previous government, they have started giving money to build buildings on them
 gaur ho ki chunaav ke aakhri dinon main jatigat aadhaar par shmashaan ko paise aavantit karnaa shuru kiya gaya tha jis par court ne roak laga di thi
 However, former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has said on this whole matter that whatever decisions were taken during his government were keeping in mind the need
 lekin vasundhara sarkaar sirf or sirf jati kii raajnneeti karne ke aadhaar par faisle le rahi he

 Scotland Yard Police had said till date that Mallya has been arrested at the request of the Indian government
 maalya ko bharat-england kii bich hui sandhi ke tahat giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 Let us tell you what this treaty is all about
 
 
 haal hi main grih mantralay ne videsh mantralay ko mumbai special court kaa vah aadesh diya tha jisamen pravartan nideshaalay ne india-euke mutual legal asistence treety (emlatt) ke tahat vijay maalya ko maamle main pesh hone ke liye apil kii thi
 According to government sources, this step was taken so that the Ministry of External Affairs could present itself before the Government of England for the extradition of Vijay Mallya
 court ne di thi manzoorigauratlab he ki mani londering cese kii jaanch kar rahi mumbai special court ne pehle hi pravartan nideshaalay ke anurodh ko manjuuri de di thi
 The Enforcement Directorate had sought permission from the court to bring Vijay Mallya to India by resorting to amalgam between India and the UK
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa tatkaaleen vikaas swaroop ne daawa kiya tha ki mantralay ne gambhir aaropon ke tahat england kii sarkaar se vijay maalya ke pratyrpan kii apil kii he
 According to the development pattern, now the Government of England has to take a decision on sending Vijay Mallya to India
 videsh mantralay ke mutabik vijay maalya ke pratyrpan kii arji unhen sibiai kii taraf se saunpi gai thi
 The ministry had moved the application to the High Commission of England in Delhi
 kya tha aropamaalya par apni company united browerij ko duniya kii sabase bade sharaab company diasio ko bechney ke baad aarope laga tha ki unhone 7000 karod rupee se adhik kii herapheri kii he
 This allegation was made by Diageo after investigating the finances of the company, after which the state-run banks of the country realized that the real loss of Mallya's misappropriation had actually occurred to them
 gauratlab he ki maalya ne apni duusari company kingfisher airlines ke liye united browerij kii guarantee par kai bainkon se paise uthaae the
 To hide this, Mallya sold Diageo's hands to United Breweries
 ye bhi padhein

 agle maah hone ja rahe raashtrapati pad ke chunaav main pranab mukherjee ke mukaable pi e sangama kii ummidavaari kaa samarthan kiye jane ke bhaajapa ke faisle kii pairvi karte hue laalkrishna adwani ne kaha ki kisi ek pratyaashee par sarvasammati banane kii jimmedaari sattarudh gathbandhan samprag kii thi, lekin uski ore se aisa koi prayaas nahin kiya gaya
 Advani said, 'it has become a' fashion 'these days in the political community to say that the candidate for the top constitutional post should be unanimously unanimous between the government and the opposition
 rajg ke kaaryakari adhyaksh ne apni nae blog main likhaa, ‘bhaajapa main ham par akasar yah sawaal daaga jaataa he ki kya congress ke mukherjee ke khilaaf do mukhyamantriyon dwaara samarthit sangama ko samarthan diya janaa kuch anuchit nahin he? main maanata hum ki is prashn kaa uttar puri tarah sattarudh dal ke aacharan par nirbhar karata he
 Accusing the ruling party of not trying to build consensus, he said that after the announcement of Mukherjee's candidature on behalf of UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called him up and requested for support
 adwani ne kaha, ‘pradhanmantri ko meraa jawaab tha ki aap ab keval hamen soochna de rahe hai, kya yah behatar nahin hota ki is ghoshnaa se pehle aapane hamase salaah mashvira kiya hota?’pradhanmantri kaa jawaab tha: ‘thik he, lekin sudhaar ke liye zyada der nahin hui he
 Advani said that shortly after the Prime Minister's call, Pranab da himself got a call
 unhone unhen ummidavaar banaae jane kii jaankaree to di lekin samarthan nahin maanga
 He said, 'I want to keep a record of the facts
 raashtrapati ke liye ab tak hue 13 chunaavon main se apatkaal ke katu anubhavon se guzarane ke baad 1977 kaa chunaav hi akelaa aisa nirvachan tha, jisamen tab ke sattarudh dal janata party ke pratyaashee neelam sanjeev reddy nirvirodh chune gaye
 The BJP leader said that apart from the said election, all the others for the post of President had to face elections
 yahaan tak ki sattarudh dal ke da rajendra prasad, da radhakrishnan yaa da zakir hossain jaise kaddavar or shreshth ummidavaaron ke khilaaf bhi ummidavaar utaare gaye or unhen chunaav kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Taking a dig at the UPA for not trying unanimously for the presidential candidate, Advani said that Congress had dominated the electoral college for several decades since independence, perhaps for the same reason that it has never opposed the opposition
 Did not think to consult
 adwani ne kaha ki congress ke is aacharan ke khilaaf 2002 main sattarudh rajg ne da apije abdul kalam ko raashtrapati pad kaa ummidavaar banane ke bare main sochaa or atal bihari vaajapeyi ne sonia gandhi or sapa ke mulaayam singh se baat karke unhen saath liya
 He said that most of the parties agreed in the name of Kalam with the effort of NDA
 lekin vam morche ne lakshmi sahagal ko kalam ke viruddh chunaav ladaaya
 The BJP leader said that the Presidential election in 1969 was the most bizarre when the then Congress President and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi fielded VV Giri as an independent candidate and named his own party Congress' authorized candidate Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy as the voice of conscience But got it delivered
 16 saal ke lambey antaraal ke baad jiesti (guds and sarvice tex) bill apane anjaam kii dahalij par he
 After hard work, this bill was approved in Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha main paas hone ke baad bill ko raashtrapati pranab mukherjee kii bhi manjuuri mil gai he
 Pranab Mukherjee has signed the Constitution Amendment Bill related to GST
 aarthik sudhaar kii disha mengstiki ahm bhoomika hone vaali he
 The government is powering to implement this law from 1 April 2017
 lekin shaayad, ise amalijama pehanaane main kuch or vakt lag jaae
 The government is also accepting this
 darasal maujuuda samay main pratyaksh or apratyaksh tex kisi utpaada kii keemat utpaadan se lekar graahakon ke haath tak pahunchane main duguni se lekar tiguni tak ho jaati he
 With the implementation of GST, customers will suddenly get the benefit, because there will be an additional savings of Rs 10 to 15 for purchases of Rs 100
 jiskaa phayda aam aadmi ke saath-saath desh kii aarthik sehat par padegaa
 People will suddenly suffer from inflation and this will be the biggest relief for the government
 ye 10 bade phaayde desh kii janata ke liye:-1
 Currently, consumers pay 30 to 35 percent tax on different things
 kuch chizon main tex 50 fisadi tak chukaane padate hai
 After the implementation of GST, all taxes will be limited to 17 to 18 per cent
 2
 In the current era, the price of the same thing seems different in the two states
 kyonki rajya apane hisaab se tex lete hai
 But after GST, the price of any item be it Delhi or Manipur will be same
 saath hi ek tex lagane se aam aadmi kii jeb main paise bachenge
 3
 sabase bada phayda ghar kharidne par milegaa
 The enactment of GST law will end the imposition of VAT and service tax, and then the price of the house will fall
 4
 The GST will be relieved for the food enthusiasts in the restaurant, as at present the state levies different taxes on it
 abhi 6 fisadi sarvice tex ke alaave bill ke 40 fisadi hisse par 15 fisadi alag setexlagate hai, lekin jiesti ke baad ye saare tex khatm ho jaaenge or keval 17 se 18 fisadi tak tex lagenge
 5
 jiesti ko amalijama pehanaane ke baad tex dhaancha samaan hone ke saath-saath puri tarah se paardarshee hoga, jisase tex vivaad lagbhag khatm ho jaaenge
 Also, tax evasion will be controlled
 dheron tex kanoon or tex niamakon (regulatoron) kaa jhanjhat nahin rahegaa
 Which will improve the economic health of the common man
 6
 a tax slab will provide relief to traders
 tamaam choti-badi companiyaan iskaa phayda uthaaegi
 The problems related to tax will be relieved
 maal dhulaai ko lekar alag-alag rajyon main lagane vaale tex band ha jayega
 Which will save companies and increase business
 7
 New avenues will open for those who set up new businesses
 saath hi desh ke kisi kone main wo apana kaarobaar karne ke liye swatantra hoga
 Because the tax structure in the entire country will be the same, it will also be much lower than the current tax ratio
 8
 All the small and big companies of the country will expand their business from one state to another
 kyonki abhi jo tamaam tarah ke seemaa shulk lag rahe hai wo band ho jaaenge
 Due to less expenditure of companies, they will cut the price of products, which will directly benefit the common man
 9
 According to a report by the National Council of Applied Research, the implementation of GST can increase the country's GDP by one-quarter to two per cent
 10
 Exide duty, service tax received by the Center will be abolished as soon as GST is implemented
 jabaki rajya sarkaar kii ore se liye jane vaala waite, antertenment tex, lagjri tex vagairah bhi khatm ho jaaenge
 It is worth noting that GST was first discussed in the General Budget for the year 2006-07 in India
 tab se kai maukon par is kanoonee rup dene kii koshishen huin, lekin anjaam tak nahin pahunchaaya ja sakaa

 Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha alleges, "the state government's health officials know when the disease spreads, who becomes a victim, when it ends

 The apex court had said at the time that if it was allowed, the 'institution would be destroyed'
 bataa den ki justise mishra ko sunwaayee se alag karne kii maang yachikakartaon ne kii thi
 He said that since Justice Mishra was involved in the 2018 judgment, he should be exempted from this hearing
 sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne kaha ki yadi justise arun mishra ko paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth se hataaya gaya, to yah itihaas main ek kaala adhyay hoga
 It is like an attack on the judiciary
 sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne kisaan sanghathanon ke vakil shyaam dewan se kaha ki sunwaayee se justise mishra ko hataane kii maang karnaa galat he
 Do you want a person of your choice in the back of five judges
 yah ek gambhir masalaa he or itihaas kahegaa ki ek varisht vakil bhi is prayaas main shaamil tha
 On this question of the court, Diwan said that a judge should withdraw from the hearing in view of the fear of prejudice
 aisa na hone par janata kaa bharosa uth jayega or isliye vah santhaan kii imaanadaaree ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye jaj ko hataane kaa nivedan kar rahe hai
 Diwan and other lawyers said that Justice Mishra should recuse himself from the case as he was a part of the judgment pronounced last year
 us faisle main unhone apane man kii baat kahi thi
 At the same time, during the hearing, Justice Mishra found that the petition to remove him from the bench was sponsored
 unhone kaha ki yadi ham aise prayaason ke aage jhuk gaye to yah itihaas main sabase kaala adhyay hoga
 These forces want to run the court in a particular way
 is santhaan ke saath jo kuch ho rahaa he vah hairaan karne vaala he
 Please tell that the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court has to consider the decisions given by the different benches of the Supreme Court in this regard in 2014 and 2018
 2018 ke faisle main justise arun mishra shaamil the isliye yachikakartaon kaa kahana tha ki unhen is bench main shaamil nahin hona chahie

 The company's Chief Finance Officer Anil Chanana said that we will recruit 5,000 employees for the purpose of our expansion plan in 2010
 unhone kaha ki company is vitt varsh july maah tak apane karmchaariyon kii vetan badhotaree bhi karegi
 Chanana said that the company has started getting new contracts again and its profits are also increasing
 aise main company apane karmchaariyon kii vetan main badhotaree bhi karegi
 Significantly, IT company Infosys has already announced an increase in the salary of its employees by up to 14 percent

 The accident occurred at around 9 am when the Gujarat Transport Corporation bus was passing through the bridge, and the bridge collapsed
 magar bas pul par se aadhi nikal chuki thi is kaaran bas toote hue pul se latak gai thi
 The good thing is that there were 25 people on this bus, none of them suffered even minor injuries

 If it was just a second behind, there could have been a huge loss of life
 wo kehete hai na ki jaanko raakhe saiya maar sake na koi
 Your attention was on TV
 23 or 24 aktubar ko aalaa darje kaa live or tex free manoranjan janata ko mila
 The haze of the surgical strike that had lasted over a month was largely cut off from our political memory
 aalha oodal kii dharti mahoba se diya gaya pradhanmantri kaa bhaashan ansuna rah gaya
 You kept hearing that first the nephew said, then uncle said and then the head of the party said
 antat: takreeban haathaa-pai ke drishy ne romaanchakaari drishywali ko puraa kar diya
 But what really happened? What has changed in the socialist party after such a big conference in Lucknow? aap ne dekha hoga ki mulaayam singh yadav ne apane bhai shivpal yadav kii khub tarif kii
 So much praise that any sensible man should be worried rather than comforted by getting so much praise at such a time
 kyon? kyonki shivpal ko tarif hi mili he, na chhine gaye pad milen hai, na bhattije se milane vaala pehle jaisaa sammaan mila he, na pad milane kii koi dilasa hi di gai he
 Not only this, his fierce hooting of the party's top workers, he must also have broken the fact that he has a hold on the organization
 udhar vidhayak pehle hi akhilesh ke peeche lamabandi dikhaa chuke hai
 Mulayam Singh, his elder brother like father and everything in politics, gave him nothing but love in this process? And love too, which will keep on asking for renunciation in the coming time? Another character of the event is Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 sunne or dekhne waalon ko yahi dikhaa ki akhilesh ne ek bahut bhavuk bhaashan diya
 He showed all the signs of an obedient son and also showed that where he had to disobey his father, he did it in the larger interest of the clan, the party and the state
 sunne main to aisa laga jaise mulaayam singh yadav ne unhen chauraahey par pachhad-pachhad kar dho daalaa ho
 First of all, you have told their position
 unhen ahamkaari or munhjor bataaya ho
 But these things would really make sense Tomulayam Singh would have heard the cry of his beloved Anuj that brother, you should take up the position yourself
 lekin mulaayam singh ne daant-fatkaar ke bich akhilesh ke kad main koi kami nahin kii
 He will continue as the Chief Minister as before and whether or not Shivpal comes into the cabinet will now depend on Akhilesh's will
 vidhansabha chunaav main tikaton kaa vitaran vah khud karenge, yah bhi akhilesh ne danke kii chot par kah diya
 That is, there is no squeeze of this entire public function, it is just that Akhilesh has got the command of the party along with the government
 shivpal kaa akhriyaar kam ho gaya he, jo aage or kam hota jayega
 Gradually, they will move towards a situation where they either have to work under Akhilesh in the true sense or go into politics unknown
 akhilesh ko nishkantak viraasat saunpane kaa kaam netaji ne ek aise tanaav bhare maahaul main kar dikhaaya he, jahaan sara-hohalla shaadi main gaai jane vaali shagun kii gaaliyon main tabdeel ho gaya or swayamvar ke liye duulhaa nikasi ho gai
 After the assembly elections held at the end of 2014, there was a chance to visit Srinagar the previous day
 
 
 ek sanstha ne media summit yojit kiya, jahaan jammu-kashmir ke sthaneey or baahar se bulaae gaye patrakaron ke bich samvaad ho
 
 
 There was an effort to exchange ideas and thoughts
 
 
 varisht patrkaar lekhak kuldeep naiyar mukhya atithi the
 
 
 Saeed Naqvi, Shahid Siddiqui, Press Club President Rahul Jalali, Madhu Kishwar, Siddharth Varadarajan - around 10 journalists were invited from outside the state
 
 
 jab apane anubhavon yaa soch ko saamne rakhane kaa pehla daur shuru hua, to andaja lag gaya ki shabdon se aatishbaajee kya hoti he
 
 
 When the vocal sound is conveyed with a sharp accent, the effect begins to show
 
 
 phir paripakv logon kaa daayitv ban jaataa he ki shabdon ke maraham kii zarurat ho yaa vaastaviktaa ke binduon ko saamne rakh samajhaayaa jaae
 
 
 Most of the youth were present at the audience at the sher-e-kashmir International Convention Center adjoining Dal Lake
 
 
 ladke-ladkiyaan, jo media collejon main patrakarita kii padhai kar rahe the
 
 
 i sat in the list of the speakers and wondered what would be going on in the minds of these children
 
 
 desh ke is hisse se meraa rishta kuch purana-sa he
 
 
 She visited Jammu and Kashmir for the first time in 1979
 
 
 tamaam paryaton sthalon ke anubhav apane saath sametakar le ai thi
 
 
 Particular was a T-set made of clay, on which glass was painted
 
 
 kai saalon tak use sambhalakar istemaal kiya tha
 
 
 Now i search in the markets, but i do not see
 
 
 phir haal hi ke kuch saalon main chhuttiyon ke liye baar-baar kashmir jaati rahi
 
 
 Travel from Srinagar to Leh by road
 
 
 kargil kii pahadiyaan
 
 
 Zojila pass

 Experience reaching Khardogla Pass, the world's highest motorable road
 
 
 is rajya kii viraasat kaa failaav zahan main samaata rahaa
 
 
 Then, during last year's assembly elections, there was a chance to get mixed with the general public
 
 
 vahi vikaas kii soch sunai detii rahi
 
 
 While the election tour of up-bihar was fresh in the mind, the basic demand of the people here was the same
 
 
 haalanki baadh ke baad pareshaaniyaan badi hui thim
 
 
 Whether Mehbooba Mufti or Omar Abdullah or Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, all the leaders were seen in their political colors
 
 
 lekin shaayad khaas tha puraane srinagar yaa ab downtaun kaha jane vaala ilaaka, jahaan maine yuvaaon se mulaakaat kii
 
 
 The same area, which has been known for stone pelting
 
 
 is ilaake main camera team ke saath kaarykram record karnaa aasaan nahin hota, lekin saath mil hi jaataa he
 
 
 When the youth met, they said that we have come with preparations on the stone-pellers
 
 
 hamen kaha gaya ki aap usee par baat karengi
 
 
 Is not it
 
 
 ? maine kaha, nahin, main to yuvaaon se milane ai hum
 
 
 i want to understand their thinking
 
 
 unako sun hi rahi thi ki mujhe ek or guzarish kerani padi ki hindi yaa urdu main bolen, kyonki ye yuva angrezi main jawaab ratakar aae the
 
 
 These boys and girls wanted to give some message by speaking in English
 
 
 baharhaal kaarykram ke badhane par jo bhav samaj main aayaa, vah tha bhedbhaav kaa, naaraazgi kaa
 
 
 
 
 
 maine samajhane kii koshish ki jab upi-bihar ke log mumbai jate hai to yahi hota he
 
 
 This is what happens in Delhi with the people of the north-east
 
 
 uttar se log jab madras jate hai to aisa hi mahasoos karte hai
 
 
 We are becoming intolerant in society
 
 
 apane padosi tak se to banaakar nahin rakh pate
 
 
 While returning, it was felt that there is a need in the valley that earlier generations should not let the burden of their feelings on the youth
 
 
 jeene den yuvaaon ko us hawa main, jahaan ve apana bhavishya sanvaar saken
 
 
 Get excellent opportunities for education and employment
 
 
 fehrist lambii he
 
 
 The same list, which is not different from many other states of the country
 
 
 jarurat he baar-baar samvaad kii
 
 
 The comments 
 
 
 And this dialogue was also needed at the media summit
 
 
 kuch awaazon main vahi asahansheeltaa chhalkati rahi
 
 
 If those voices wanted to create pressure by making anti-india statements, Kuldeep Nayyar drew a line by referring to his meeting with (prime Minister of Pakistan) Nawaz Sharif that Nawaz Sharif said that neither can you give us Kashmir nor can we ask you Can take
 
 
 unki baat sabko sunani padi
 
 
 Later, college students surrounded me
 
 
 maine poocha, aap logon ne koi sawaal kyon nahin poocha, to kehane lage ki ham ghabara gaye the
 
 
 We could not muster the courage to question our future in journalism among such people
 
 
 to un chaatro ke vaastavik sawaal, jo rosemara ke jivan se jude hai, peeche chhot gaye
 
 
 But this experience was expressed that there is a need for dialogue with ordinary citizens
 
 
 un logon se, jo naagarik hai, silent majority hai

 But this experience was expressed that there is a need for dialogue with ordinary citizens
 
 
 un logon se, jo naagarik hai, silent majority hai
 
 
 My relationship with this part of the country is a bit old
 
 
 1979 main pehali baar jammu-kashmir ke daure par gai thi
 
 
 She brought all the experiences of the tourist places with her
 
 
 khaas tha chikani mitti se bana ek tii-set, jis par glass paint kiya gaya tha
 
 
 Used it with care for many years
 
 
 ab bazaaron main dhundti phirti hum, lekin dikhaa nahin
 
 
 Then in recent years, he kept going to Kashmir again and again for holidays
 
 
 srinagar se leh kaa safar road se tay kar
 
 
 Kargil Hills
 
 
 jojila paas
 
 
 Monastries
 
 
 duniya kii sabase oonchi motarable road khaardogla paas tak pahunchane kaa anubhav
 
 
 The spread of the heritage of this state remained firmly entrenched
 
 
 phir pichley saal ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan aam janata ke bich ghulne-milane kaa mauka mila
 
 
 The thought of development continued to be heard
 
 
 upi-bihar kaa chunavi daura man main taaja tha, to yahaan bhi logon kii mul maang ek jaisi thi
 
 
 However, after the floods, the problems increased
 
 
 mahabuuba mufti hon yaa umr abdulla yaa mirwiz umr faruk, sabhi netaa apane-apane siyaasi rang main dikhe
 
 
 But perhaps special was the area called Old Srinagar or now Downtown, where i met the youth
 
 
 vahi ilaaka, jo patharbaji ke liye janaa jaataa rahaa he
 
 
 It is not easy to record events with the camera team in this area, but get along
 
 
 yuva jab mili to unhone kaha ki ham to patharbaajon par taiyaari ke saath aae hai
 
 
 We were told that you would talk on the same
 
 
 he na
 
 
 The i said, no, i have come to meet the youth
 
 
 unki soch ko samajhnaa chaahati hum
 
 
 He was listening to them that i had to request another one to speak in Hindi or Urdu, because these youngsters came to English by rote
 
 
 ye ladke-ladkiyaan angreji main bolkar kuch sandesh dena chaah rahe the
 
 
 However, as the program progressed, the feeling that was understood was that of discrimination, of heartburn
 
 
 
 
 
 i tried to explain that this is what happens when people from up-bihar visit Mumbai
 
 
 uttar-purv ke logon ke saath dilli main yahi hota he
 
 
 People from north feel the same when they go to Madras
 
 
 ham samaaj main asahansheel hote ja rahe hai
 
 
 They are not able to keep it even from their neighbors
 
 
 lautate samay laga ki shaayad ghati main yah jarurat he ki pehle kii peediyaan apni bhaawanaaon kaa boj yuvaaon par na daalen
 
 
 Let the youth live in the air where they can build their future
 
 
 padhai or rojgaar ke behtareen avasar milen
 
 
 The list is long
 
 
 vahi fehrist, jo desh ke anya kai rajyon se alag nahin he
 
 
 Needs to be communicated frequently
 
 
 tippaniyan 
 
 
 or isi samvaad kii zarurat media summit main bhi padi
 
 
 The same intolerance continued in some voices
 
 
 un awaazon ne bharat virdohi bayaanbaji kar dabaav bananaa chaha, to kuldeep naiyar ne (pakistan ke pradhanmantri) nawaz sharif se apni mulaakaat kaa zikr kar rekha khinch di ki nawaz sharif ne kaha tha ki na aap hamen kashmir de sakate hai or na ham aapse kashmir le sakate hai
 
 
 Everyone had to listen to them
 
 
 baad main collejon ke chaatr-chaatraon ne mujhe gher liya
 
 
 i asked, why didn't you ask any questions, then started saying that we were nervous
 
 
 aise logon ke bich ham himmat nahin juta paae patrakarita main apane bhavishya par sawaal karne kii
 
 
 So the real questions of those students, which are related to everyday life, were left behind
 
 
 lekin yah anubhav yah jataa gaya ki samvaad kii zarurat he aam nagarikon se
 
 
 From those who are citizens, there are silent majority
 
 
 phir haal hi ke kuch saalon main chhuttiyon ke liye baar-baar kashmir jaati rahi
 
 
 Travel from Srinagar to Leh by road
 
 
 kargil kii pahadiyaan

 The prices of petrol and diesel are constantly increasing
 antarrashtriya str par kachche tel kii keemten 3 saal ke top par pahunch gai he
 This has a direct impact on the prices of petrol and diesel in the country
 badhati keemton ke bich ekbar phir petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke tahat laane kii maang uthaai ja rahi he
 However, with petrol and diesel coming under the purview of GST, the problem may increase rather than decrease
 guuruuvaar ko mumbai main ek litrpetrol kii keemat80
 Has reached 36
 dijal kii keemten bhi 67 rupee kaa aankada paar kar chuki he
 Meanwhile, in order to provide relief from the prices of petrol and diesel, there is talk of reducing excise duty in the budget
 duusari taraf, ise jiesti ke tahat laane kaa aashwaasan bhi diya ja rahaa he
 But government sources say that it does not seem possible at the moment
 bad jaaengi keemtempetrol or dijalko jiesti ke tahat laane kii pairvi karne waalon kaa kahana he ki isse petrol or dijal kii keemten kam ho jaaengi, lekin hoga iske ulat
 In fact, in the current system, many states like Maharashtra charge VAT up to 40%, while states like Andaman and Nicobar levy up to 6% tax on petrol and diesel
 kai rajyon main bad jaaenge daamjisti parishadke varisht sutron kaa kahana he ki agar petrol-dijal ko jiesti ke daayre main laayaa jaataa he, to isse deshbhar main alag-alag cells tex kii bajaay ek hi tex ho jayega
 Even though this will give some relief in some states like Maharashtra, the prices of petrol and diesel will increase in a very big way in states that charge less VAT
 aise main koi raajnneetik party nahin chaahegi ki vah aisa koi kadam uthaae
 There will not be consensus in the states
 Whenever there is an increase in the prices of crude oil at the international level, it also increases the revenue of the states
 rajyon ke rajasav kii ek badi rakam petrol or dijal par lagane vaale waite se aati he
 With this, the governments of the state levying lower VAT will not agree to bring petrol and diesel under GST, given their political gains
 kyonki unke saamne jiesti kii vajah se keemten badhane kaa khatra hoga
 The Center also did not expect relief
 To provide relief from rising petrol and diesel prices, the oil ministry has suggested reducing excise duty in the budget
 haalanki sarkaar kii taraf se aisi koi ghoshnaa hone kii sambhaavna bhi naa ke baraabar he
 In view of rising prices and anger of the people, the central government in October reduced excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 2
 rajkoshiya ghaataa badhane kaa khatrahaalanki ab aisa kadam uthaane kaa matlab hoga ki sarkaar apanaarajakoshiya ghatbadhane kaa khatra paidaa karegi
 Reducing excise duty means reducing the fiscal deficit3
 2 fisadi rakhane kaa lakshya sarkaar ke liye hasil karnaa mushkil ho jayega
 In such a situation, the possibility of immediate relief from the center is almost nil
 tel companiyon se bhi raahat kii ummid kamadusari taraf, tel companiyon se bhi is morche par raahat milane kii ummid kam hi he
 Crude oil prices are increasing internationally
 isaki vajah se companiyon kaa kharch bhi lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, it is impossible to get relief from these companies on the prices of petrol and diesel
