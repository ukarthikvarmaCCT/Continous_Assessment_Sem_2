 But Diljit Dosanjh, the actor of the film 'udta Punjab', was chosen for this award
 is baat se narazharshavardhanne apane dil kaa gubaar nikaalte hue ek intervyuu main kaha ki 'haalanki maine apni film ke liye do aword jite hai, par mujhe puri ummid thi ki filmphere kaa debyue aword bhi mujhe hi milegaa
 But i think there is a different parameter for each award
 main eemaandaar rahunga
 However, i feel that any actor should get a Debut Award for his first film and not for him who has worked in films in many languages and industry
 'movie Review: pyaar kaa jaadu nahin chalaa pai 'mirzia'harshavardhanke twit ko aade haath lete hue filmphere kii agxcutive editor anuraadhaa choudhary ne javaabi twit kiya ki aajkal newtomar actors khud ko itnaa kaabil or aword ke hakdaar maanane lage hai, jiske bare main sochaa bhi nahin ja saktaa
 Along with this, Anuradha retweeted and wrote that 'harshvardhan Kapoor feels that he deserves more than Diljit, then improve your acting
 'the sense of self entitlement some of these newcomer actors have is beyond imagination
 If only they were half as talented

 He said that he will not hesitate to take whatever steps are required to completely thwart the intrusion
 general bipin ravat ne kaha ki unki taqatsenake ek-ek jawan hai or un javaanon kaa hausala badhanaa hoga, taaki wo har vakt taiyaar rahen or datakar dushmano kaa mukaabal kar saken
 At the same time, the Chief of Army Staff said that several cases of attack on the army were reported in the past, which have been reviewed
 sena pramukh ne mana ki pichley dinon hue nagarota hamale ko pehle naakaam kiya ja saktaa tha
 He said that Atankilalgatar keeps changing his strategy and he gets support from many places
 aise main us hisaab se hamen bhi taiyaar rahane kii jarurat he
 Bipin Rawat said in the conversation that the government has given him some responsibility, and he will try to fulfill it
 sena pramukh ek aisa pad he jise desh vishwaas kii najar se dekhtaa he
 The army chief said that firing is carried out in retaliation only when a ceasefire is violated at the border
 unhone bataaya ki jahaan aatankiyon ke khilaaf sargical strike kii baat he to har baar sargical strike karnaa aasaan nahin he or jaruri bhi nahin
 According to Bipin Rawat, stopping the suicide attack is the most difficult task
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii ore se pradhanmantri narendra modi ko DNA vaale bayaan par maafee maangane or shabd waapas lene kii maang karte hue khulaa khat likhaa to bachaav main endie ke netaa utar aae hai
 The leaders of the NDA wrote a letter to the people of Bihar giving their views and appealed to the people not to deviate
 padhie puri chitthee yahaan-bihar ke priy bahanon or bhaaiyon,aaj subah jari hua bihar ke mukhyamantri kaa patr bahut niraashajanak he
 We were thinking that this letter would be about the progress of Bihar
 bihar kii unnati ko lekar hoga lekin ham galat soch rahe the
 The letter cannot be called 'khoda Pahad aur Nikli Chuhiya', because it does not contain a word about the progress of Bihar and Biharis
 hamen pidaa is baat kii he ki jis bihar ke paas desh kaa growth ingine banane kii kshamta he, us bihar kii aawaaj ko ek aadmi kii aawaaj, ekamukhyamantri or uske hath kii aawajabanane kii saaf, nindaneey or sochi samajhi sajeesh kii gai he
 In Bihar, trying to steer people at their behest has never been successful
 ham vinamrata purvak kahana chaahate hai ki- ‘bihar is not Nitish Kumar and Nitish Kumar is not Bihar
 i am Bihar, this is Nitish's confusion
 ’ bihar ke mukhyamantri kaa patr bataata he ki ek vyakti apane hath or sattalolupata ke liye kis had tak ja saktaa he
 It is clear that this step of the Chief Minister is not in accordance with the ethos of Bihar
 bihar to loktantr, sahishnutaa, samvaad or doordarshee netritv kii bhoomi he
 From Bihar itself, Lord Buddha gave the message of peace and tolerance
 ye bihar hi he jiskaa itihaas loktantric paramparaon se sanmruddh he or ye bihar hi he jo sikandar jaise aakrantaon kaa manamardan karne kii kshamta rakhata he
 Bihar's culture is not an insult to the poor, the deprived, the exploited and the Mahadalits, but Mr
 Nitish Kumar only enjoys doing so
 isse pataa chalata he ki shri nitish kumaar ke salaahkaar ek baar phir fail sabit hue hai
 But, it is not surprising, because even before this, in the seduction of the group of spouses living around him, he started believing that he can become the Prime Minister of India
 is kaaran unhone bijepi ke saath apana gathbandhan bhi tod diya
 After that history bears witness to what happened
 haalanki shri nitish kumaar se itani to apeksha kii hi ja sakati he ki unamem shabdon or muddon kii samaj hogi
 The Prime Minister, in his speech on 26 July in Muzaffarpur, made a very precise and relevant comment about Mr
 Nitish Kumar's political journey, which in our (and many others') opinion is expressed as deceit, treachery and favor
 Can
 pradhanmantri kaa bayaan shri nitish kumaar (na ki bihar) ke raajnneeti diene ke bare main tha (na hi unke yaa bihar ke diene ke bare main, jaisaa ki unhone use shararthpurvak prachaarit kiya)
 Mr
 Nitish Kumar, before writing to the Prime Minister, you kindly apologize to the people of Bihar for distorting the Prime Minister's words for his political gain and for degrading Bihar
 ham bihar ke logon ko bataanaa chaahate hai ki endie kii sarkaar aane ke baad beete ek saal membihar kii pragatimen ullekhneey vruddhi hue he
 Be it representation in ministries, allocation of resources or completion of development projects, Bihar has always been on priority
 jin logon ne kaha ki pradhanmantri in 14 maheenon main kabhi bihar nahin aae, unase hamaara kahana he ki kya unhone kabhi us samay niraashaa jataai jab pichley pradhanmantri ko unke das varshon ke kaarykaal main ek baar kiye gaye hawaii survey ko chhod kabhi bihar aane kaa mauka nahin mila
 Mr
 Nitish Kumar's politics is ABCD - Arrogance, Betrayal, Conspiracy and Deceit
 koi aashcharya nahin ki shri lalu prasad yadav ne unke bare main kaha, aisa koi sagaa nahin, jisko nitish ne thaga nahin
 Who knows them better than dear Lalu ji
 or kya aisa kehane ke liye unhone kabhi unhen khuli chitthee likhi he
 The Chief Minister of Bihar has also quoted JP and Lohia, but we also shudder to think what JP and Lohia ji would say about this new friendship, and those they are supporting (first quietly and now openly)
 
 aakhir wo aaazaad bharat kii ab tak kii sabase bhrasht sarkaar upie2 kaa samarthan karne ke paap se kaise mukt ho sakate hai
 When Mr
 Nitish Kumar broke the alliance with the BJP, you know what was the biggest loss - the development of Bihar and the frustration of the aspirations of the people of Bihar
 aapane vikaas kii ummid ke saath endie ko vot diya tha
 And this hope shattered in front of a person's stubbornness and ambition
 gathbandhan tuutane ke baad shri nitish kumaar ke donon kaarykaal ne ‘sushasan babu’ ke myth kaa sach saamne laa diya diya he
 Apart from this, we are happy that the Chief Minister of Bihar has got a new job - the work of writing letters to Shri Narendra Modi
 unhone iske liye ek special website bhi banaai he
 We believe this is the first letter and the rest are coming, because after November 2015, they will have plenty of time to write the letter
 khaas baat ye he ki ab ham unhen un madhyamon ke jariye patr post karte hue dekh rahe hai, jinhen wo pehle tuchh maanakar khaarij kar dete the
 Sisters and brothers of Bihar, now you have to decide
 kya ham unhen chaahate hai jo asli muddon se hamen bhatkaana chaahate hai yaa ham ek aisi team chaahate hai jo apana prayek kshan bihar kii pragati ke liye lagaae or bihar ko bharat kaa sarvaadhik viksit rajya banaae
 In Bihar, there is a desire for development and good governance, and not political politics, arrogance and 'jungle raj'

 But now the Rajasthan government has passed the proposal from the cabinet, ending the provisions related to population control government jobs
 bataa den ki rajasthan sarkaar ne sarkari karmchaariyon ke teen bacchon se zyada paidaa karne par nilamban sambandhi kanoon ko khatm kar diya he
 Earlier, the Vasundhara government had withdrawn the law prohibiting government employees from having two children
 jiske baad november 2016 main sarkari naukari milane ke baad do bacchon se zyada paidaa karne par pramotion or inkrement rokane ke niyam ko khatm kiya gaya tha
 In this case, the Law Minister of Rajasthan Rajendra Rathore says that the population is not growing properly in Rajasthan
 isliye in pratibandhaatmak kanoonon ko khatm kiya ja rahaa he
 On Wednesday, the cabinet passed a resolution amending the Civil Services Act and abolishing the law of two children
 purv uparashtrapati bhairo singh shekhavat ne jansankhya niyantran kaa kanoon banaaya tha magar kai saalon se rajasthan kii jansankhya nahin bad paa rahi thi
 Reacting to the government's decision, Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma said that in this time, there is a thought of going backwards to stop the prohibition on giving birth to more than three children for a government job
 bataa den ki rajasthan apane jansankhya niyantran ke pravaadhanon ke liye ek pragatisheel rajya ke taur par janaa jaataa he
 Where many steps have been taken from former Chief Minister Bhairon Singh Shekhawat to Ashok Gehlot
 1992 main do bacchon se zyada bacchon ke pita ko sarkari naukari main roak kaa kanoon bana tha
 After that, in 2002, while working in a government job, a law was made to stop promotion and increment on more than two children
 phir teen bacchon se zyada par nilamban kaa kanoon bana
 But RSS and Sangh-associated organizations were constantly insisting on increasing Hindu population

 (from input language) (input bhashaa se) The Delhi High Court reserved its decision on the plea of the Delhi government not to allow blueline buses to come back on the roads of the national capital
 sarkari vakil or nijee bason ke sanchaalkon kii daleelon ko sunne ke baad nyaayamurti eke sikari or nyaayamurti suresh kait kii khandpeeth ne apana faisla surakshit rakh liya
 Appearing before the bench, government lawyer Nazmi Vajiri said that public safety is the top priority of the government and to date the government has a fleet of adequate buses to meet the needs of public transport
 vakil ne daawa kiya ki pichley saal 2,000 lo floor bason ko shaamil kiye jane se janata ko bahut raahat mili he or blueline bason ke charanbaddh tareeke se hataane se durghatnaon main behad kami ai he
 He said that the court should not allow the operators to run the bus before the government implements the cluster system
 vajiri ne kaha ki jan-parivahan kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye sarkaar ke paas 6,500 bason kaa bedaa he or charanbaddh dhang se isamen 4000 basen or jodi jaaengi
 The operators of the blueline bus argued that private buses should be allowed to run on roads until the government implements the cluster system and their participation in the allocation of clusters should also be ensured
 baar-baar durghatana kii khabaron ke baad hoicourt ne dilli sarkaar ko bluelil bason ko hataane kaa nirdesh diya tha or sarkaar ne charanbaddh tareeke se zyaadaatar blueline bason ko hataa liya he

 lekin uske baad agar ve do match badhiya khele to phir cap hamaare paas hi rahegaa
 Ganguly says that the Indian cricket team is basically a limited-overs team and their record in the World Cup has been excellent

 ek iraqi kahani or he
 a man came out of his house in Baghdad, saw his death standing at the crossroads, he returned home running, he told his boss that he had died, he would give him his horse and run away to Samara
 maalik ne use ghoda de diya
 After some time, when the owner came out, he also saw the same death
 usne poocha, tumne mere dost ko daraa kyon diya? use ghur kyon rahi thi? maut ne kaha, 'main to khud hairaan thi, vah yahaan kya kar rahaa he
 After four hours, i was to meet him in Samara
 ' You cannot escape from death
 buddha ne apane bachapan main hi samaj liya tha ki beemaari aati he, budhapa aata he or mrityu aati he
 But when the Constitution Bench of the five judges of the Supreme Court stamped the will on death with certain conditions, in fact they were not only focusing on the philosophical relation of life and death or the inevitability of death but also on the social crisis which in our society Is born of loneliness and disease of the elderly
 boodha yaa biimaar hona abhishaap nahin he, akelaa hona kahin zyaada bada abhishaap he
 When you are alone, old age follows you more quickly
 beemaari kahin zyaada jaldi aapako gherti he
 It is true that even in our old times, there were elderly people who kept neglecting the houses - they fell ill in the corners alone, but they did not surround them like euthanasia
 bhartiya samaaj main yah ek nai parighatna he- aise bujurg bad rahe hai jinako apane liye yah ichhamrityu chahie
 Undoubtedly, this need stems from the desire for a dignified end to a dignified life
 lekin aruna shanbagh ke jis maamle se yah sara prasang itnaa bada hua, uskaa ek or sabak he
 Aruna Shanbaug, who was in a coma for 42 years, has been demanding euthanasia for those who watch her from outside
 iskaa virodh un logon ne kiya jo unki dekhbhaal karti thim
 Those nurses of King Edward College, Mumbai, would not have survived 42 years in this situation if they were not handling their soi-lost friends very carefully
 in nurson ne kaha ki ve jab tak sambhav hoga, aruna shanbagh ko zindaa rakhengi
 If a crime sent Aruna Shanbaug into a coma forever, some people fought for her life
 unke jivan ko garimapurna banaaya
 The court also respected this concern, so the shadow of his decision of indirect euthanasia did not allow him to fall asleep on an uninformed body for 40 years
 darasal jivan kaa mulya isi main he
 We live as much for ourselves as we do for others
 dusron se hamaara jivan he, ham dusron ke jivan se hai
 But the pressures of new times are making everyone alone
 parivaar toote hue hai, bachche pariwaron se dur hai, maa-pita akele hai, tole-mohalle khatm ho gaye hai, flaton main katate jivan ke bich badhata budhapa ek laailaaj beemaari main badalata jaataa he
 In a very subtle but cruel process, we all become partners
 ichha mrityu isi krur prakriya se nikalne kii ek lambii aakiri saans jaisi gali he
 If the Supreme Court did not open this street, then the frustrations would become bigger, which makes such options worth trying in our time

 king edward college mumbai kii ve norsen apni ek soi-khoi saheli ko roj bahut ehtiyaat se sambhaal na rahi hotin to vah 42 saal is haal main nahin bachati
 These nurses said that they will keep Aruna Shanbag alive as long as possible
 ek aparaadh ne agar aruna shanbagh ko hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye coma main bhej diya to kuch logon ke sarokaar ne unke liye jivan kii ladaai ladi
 Made his life dignified
 adaalat ne bhi is sarokaar kaa sammaan kiya tha, tab paroksh ichhamrityu ke apane faisale kii chaaya 40 baras se soi ek bekabar kaaya par nahin padane di thi
 Actually life has its value in this
 ham jitna apane liye jite hai, utana hi dusron ke liye bhi
 We belong to others, we belong to others
 lekin nae samay ke dabaav sabko akelaa kar rahe hai
 Families are broken, children are away from families, parents are lonely, neighborhoods are gone, growing old age turns into an incurable disease in the flats
 ek bahut baarik magar krur prakriya main ham sab jaise bhagidaar hote chalate hai
 Desire death is a long last breath-like alley from this cruel process
 supreme court agar yah gali na kholta to ve hataashaaen or badi hoti jaatin jo hamaare samay main aise vikalpon ko bhi aajamaae jane laayak banaati hai
 Perhaps this decision reminds some people not to be left so lonely and desperate to have their own medical board set up for their deaths
 yah bahut sadashay kaamana he, lekin aisi hi kaamanaayon ke bich jivan kii sundarataa or sahajata bachati bhi he

 darasal jivan kaa mulya isi main he
 We live as much for ourselves as we do for others
 dusron se hamaara jivan he, ham dusron ke jivan se hai
 But the pressures of new times are making everyone alone
 parivaar toote hue hai, bachche pariwaron se dur hai, maa-pita akele hai, tole-mohalle khatm ho gaye hai, flaton main katate jivan ke bich badhata budhapa ek laailaaj beemaari main badalata jaataa he
 In a very subtle but cruel process, we all become partners
 ichha mrityu isi krur prakriya se nikalne kii ek lambii aakiri saans jaisi gali he
 If the Supreme Court did not open this street, then the frustrations would become bigger, which makes such options worth trying in our time
 shaayad yah faisalaa kuch logon ko yaad dilaae ki unke apane itane akele or hataash na chhot jaaen ki apni mrityu ke liye apana medical board banavaane lagen
 This is a very good wish, but there is also beauty and spontaneity of life left between such wishes

 iske baad bollywood main bhi casting couch kii charchaa shuru ho gai

 My driver is from North India
 vah jab apane aasapaas kisi mahila ko driving karata dekhtaa he to kahata he ki jab inhen car chalaani nahin aati to kyon chalaati hai
 It remains in the minds of men that they have to control women
 anuraag se pehle ekta bhi is bare main apni baat kah chuki hai
 They say that not only producers or powerful people sexually exploit, but also the actors themselves use their sexuality to get work
 ye is maamle kaa doosraa paksh he, jisaki koi baat nahin karata
 'drunk Jitendra had tried rape', read what Kajin wrote in the complaint, i think Harvie Winstein is present in Bollywood, but there is another aspect of this story, which people don't want to talk about
 haa, ye sach hai ki industry main produsar jaise powerful log hai, jo apane power kaa galat phayda uthaate hai, lekin duusari ore actor bhi hai, jo kaam paane ke liye apni sexuality kaa istemaal karte hai
 i feel that such people should not be kept in a blueprint of power
 ye hameshaa sach nahin hota ki jiske paas power na ho, vah peedit ho hi
 Ekta Kapoor further said, as a producer, when i talk to my male counterparts, they say that they get offers directly

 ashok choudhary ne likhaa he ki aam log bijepi kii reeti nitiyon ke saath hai kintu pradesh sanghathan ke ravaiye se khaasaa naaraaz hai
 In such a situation, demanding a change of leadership in the state, it is said that Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and State President Ashok Parnami should be replaced
 ashok choudhary ne kaha he kiab janamat ke saath vidroh prarambh ho chukaahe jaisaa kii vidit he pradesh bijepi main satta main baithe log sanghathan ko panpane nahin de rahe or sanghathan aaj bhi bina pravaktaaon ke mook darshak banakar baitha he
 Ashok Chaudhary said that people are not happy with the work of Vasundhara Raje and due to this, the morale of the party workers is continuously falling
 unhone kaha- pradesh adhyaksh ashok paranami vasundhara kii gulaami karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki sanghathan ko lagaataar nuksaan pahunchaa rahe hai
 And their grip on the organization is getting loosened
 party ke kaaryakarta or padaadhikari unki kaaryastylee se pareshaan ho rahe hai
 He said that Vasundhara Raje has come in the bureaucrat's chakravyuh and has brought the party and government on such a path where only defeat is defeat and nothing else
 ashok choudhary ne kaha ki sanghathan ke ek-ek kaaryakarta ke man main party or sarkaar ke prati gaharaa aakrosh punap rahaa he, jise vidhansabha chunaav se pehle dur kiya janaa chahie
 The farmers, workers and the entire class of the state are angry
 bijepi ke rajasthan main bijepi ne hi haraaya he
 After losing to Alwar, Ajmer and Mandalgarh, the BJP worker is thinking that now the party will take a lesson
 rajasthan kaa bijepi kaaryakarta rajya main netritv parivartan chahta he
 In such a situation, Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and BJP state president Ashok Parnami should be replaced so that they will be faced with new energy in the upcoming assembly elections

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke yah vichaar sujhaaye jane ke teen maheene ke bheerat prastaav sweekaar kar liya gaya tha
 On this occasion, Sushma said, 'here i would like to put three important things

 'he said,' The Prime Minister made this proposal during his address to the United Nations General Assembly on 27 September last year

 'the foreign minister said,' Secondly, the proposal was passed within 75 days of record time and thirdly it was the first proposal in which 177 countries became co-sponsors for World Yoga Day

 Input from language 16veen loksabhaa ke liye hue chunaav ke parinaam ne bihar se judi kai manyataon ko na keval dhwast kar diya, balki puraane jaateey sameekaran ke bhi badalane ke sanket die
 While the talk of contesting the caste equation in Bihar is old, but after this election it has been decided that the walls of the caste equations of political parties are cracking
 isse bihar main nae jaateey sameekaran ke ubharne ke sanket bhi mil rahe hai
 Bihar's politics revolved around regional satraps after the Congress's influence waned in Bihar, but after the alliance of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal United (JDU) broke down last year, all major political parties switched to the new caste equation Started searching aise main bihar ke pramukh raajnneetik dalon ne chunaav main tikat bantwaare main bhi apane jaateey samikarnon kaa puraa khyaal rakhaa tha
 The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) gave tickets to 17 upper castes and won 14 in this election
 teen savarna ummidavaar jo haare, ve nivartmaan saansad the
 Even though most of the upper caste candidates of NDA won the election, none of the upper caste candidates of JDU and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) could win
 jediu ne 10 tathaa argedy or congress gathbandhan ne aath savarna jati ke pratyaashee chunaav maidan main utaare the
 The MJ (muslim-yadav) equation of RJD also appeared to be difficult in this election
 kai aisi siten hai, jahaan in donon jatiyon ke matadaata adhik hai, lekin vahaan argedy ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 Keeping this equation in mind, the RJD and the Congress alliance fielded 11 Yadav candidates from different regions, but only two Yadav candidates could wear the victory
 endie ne chaar yadav netaaon ko tikat diya tha
 All of them made a sense of winning the election by making a dent in the rjd's yadav-muslim vote bank
 sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (upie) ne aath muslim pratyaashee maidan main utaare the, lekin katihaar, arriya or kishanganj se hi uske muslim pratyaashee jeet sake
 The JDU, which split from the BJP in the name of Narendra Modi, tried to attract the Muslim voters
 isi ke tahat jediu ne 13 muslim ummidavaaron ko tikat dekar chunaav maidan main utaara, magar uskaa ek bhi muslim pratyaashee kaamyaab nahin ho sakaa
 JDU strategists are believed to have Muslim faith, but have not been successful in this, but on the other hand, the alliance of BJP with Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) appeared to be a profitable deal
 looks like
 endie ne sabhi surakshit siton par jeet kaa paracham laharaaya he
 While Gopalganj, Sasaram and Gaya came in favor of BJP, LJP candidates from Hajipur, Jamui, Samastipur have emerged victorious
 isi tarah endie se kushvaha jati ke do ummidavaar vijayi hue hai, vahiin ati pichde jati ke bhi teen pratyaashee chunaav jite hai

" darasal, kedarnath hinduon ke chaar dham main se ek dham he
 Jyotirlinga, which is situated at the highest of twelve Jyotirlingas, is also here
 yahi vajah he ki jab kedarnath par 2013 main aapadaa utari, jisamen hajaaron log jaan ganvaa baithe, hajaaron ghayal hue or pratyaksh or paroksh rup se kareeb paanch lakh prabhavit hue to puraa desh dahal uthaa
 For this reason, and being the center of faith, Kedarnath's reconstruction also saw a lot of politics
 aakhir yah pahari rajya or ek myne main puure desh main bhi baaki muddon-masalon ko dhak lene kaa bahaanaa bhi jo banataa he
 This political competition laid the foundation for this new construction, on which new questions are being raised

 harish ravat ne aarope bhi lagaaya ki mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat kii bhaajapa sarkaar kedarnath kshetra kii upeksha kar rahi he
 The result will be that the goal of bringing fifty lakh pilgrims here in 2018 cannot be met

 nirmaan kii siyaasi hodabaharhaal, kedarnath aapadaa ke baad yah sochna aasaan nahin tha ki ek saal ke bheetar hi kedarnath yatra shuru ho jaaegi
 One reason for this was that people's lives in the Kedarnath Valley and Uttarakhand depended on travel

 The policy debates in New Delhi on inequality focus on poverty, the constantly falling Gini Index ('indian Income Inequality, 1922– 2014' 'lucas Chancel and Thomas Piketty) or how the top 1 per cent of the national income
 22 per cent of it is occupied, while the lower half accounts for only 15 per cent
 (vishwa asamanta report 2017)
 But the people in the street procession see the non-equal as an inequality of opportunities
 yah baat vaaki pate kii lagati he
 The annual per capita income of just $ 1,710 (while the per capita income in the US is $ 57,000 and China is $ 8,100) clearly indicates that we have a long way to go
 hamaari asli sampada yani 18 saal se kam umr ke 45 karod nagarikon ko abhi apane safar kii shuruyaat kerani he
 For them (in terms of market, services and location), the amount of access to growing opportunities may be a measure of non-equal measure
 lekin, jab zyaadaatar jaankaar jorshor se daawa kar rahe hai ki 10 fisadi kii aarthik vikaas dar se hamaari sari dikkatein chhu mantar ho jaaengi, to bhala gaiyr-bararbari par chintaa karne kii jarurat kya he?gaiyr-barabari kar sakati he vikaas kii raftaar avarudghatamam viksit desh yah koshish karte hai ki uneyaha lagaataar utpaadak vrudghi dar bani rahe
 It seems that this increase brings benefits to the society as a whole along with individuals
 vikaas ko dderghaavadhik or tikaoo do kaarak banaate hai: lagaataar saamaajik gatishiltaa or har aadmi kaa usase judaav
 The circle of development does not benefit everyone equally and simultaneously
 aksar aisa swaabhaavik badhat main fark se hota he jaise koi samudaay kitna padhaa-likhaa he, yaa bandargahon yaa upjau bhoomi tak uski pahunch kitni he, vagairah
 Or, the allocation of government capital can also make a difference, such as investment in airports in lieu of roads, attention to irrigation or police force, a development-oriented leader is chosen, or a candidate born with a compromise
 kaaran jo bhi hon lekin hakeekat yahi he ki log vikaas ke alag-alag raaston ko chunate hai
 Then they should also make sure that no wrong is being done to them
 unhen yah bharosa karnaa padataa he ki ek din unhen bhi mauka milegaa
 Otherwise, the sounds of dissatisfaction turn into protest
 agar unhen suna nahin jaataa he to log 'koi or' khadaa kar lete hai or atirek vaale rajnatik vikalpon ke paksh main vot dekar samoochee vyavastha ko hi khaarij kar dete hai
 Brexit and Trump are two examples
 to, kya sabhi bhartiya yah maanate hai ki avasaron, jagahon or sevaaon tak unki pahunch aasaan he?buniyadi sevaayen or sabsidi avasar muhaiyaa hona nahinpahale acchhee khabar
 Seventy years of democracy have given a new dimension to the non-equal civilization for centuries that every Indian is equal from birth
 rajya kii koshishon main buniyadi sevaaon kii uplabdhta, sabko skool main daakhila, duniya kaa sabase vishaal khaadya suraksha kaarykram, gramin sadaken or, ab sabake liye bijli or sulabh awaas
 In view of our huge population and area, all this is not an easy task
 to, chunauti kya he? ye sarkari upaay barabari kaayam karne ke liye kaaphi nahin hai
 For every youth to have access to opportunities, he should be healthy, skillful and should belong to a community in which adequate employment opportunities (private or governmental) are created due to policies, according to his skills and expectations
 hakeekat yah he ki matra sehat or saaf-safai kii badahaali se takreeban 48 fisadi bacchon kaa vikaas ruk jaataa he
 Inadequate infrastructure and lack of appropriate teacher training, 40 per cent of the children leave school by the time they reach eighth grade, less than 12 per cent of the youth are able to study till graduation
 uske baad unki padhai or hunar unki naukariyon se mail nahin khate
 Sectors related to construction, hospitality, and public services will generate large numbers of jobs, but we are not making people efficient for those jobs (or creating social equality)
 or, ant main hamaari nitiyaan vikaas kii sakaaratmak disha main nahin, balki aksar aasaan raah chun leti hai
 Recently there were movements of Jats, Marathas, Patidars and Kapus who have been a prosperous and politically influential section ever
 unhen apane samudaayon ke shikshit yuvaaon ko lekar chintaa he kyonki sarkari naukariyaan 'arakshit' hai or nijee naukariyaan bahut kam hai
 Expecting public jobs can be a solution for them, but they need good jobs or jobs, whether in agriculture or in cities
 krishi ko phydemand banane ke liye bada badlaav kii darkaar hogiah praudyogikeey nivesh, vistrut bhu-istemaal (bhu-swaamitv nahin), fasalon main badlaav or upaj keemton par taqatvar bicheliyon ke dabadabe kaa khaatmaa
 All these hard choices require political will
 lekin hamaare netaaon ko to krishi rin kii maafee sabase aasaan samaadhaan najar aati he
 Similarly, in the case of Indian women, the opportunities are extremely less
 900 stri-purush anupaat or maatr 27 fisadi kaamkaaji mahilaayein (pashchim asia ko chhod den to samoochee duniya main sabase nimna str) bataati hai ki bhartiya mahilaon ke liye jagah kitni kam he
 In a country that needs millions of doctors, teachers, policemen and entrepreneurs, it is like losing the talent of such a large number of women
 isi tarah suraksha ke khatir ghar ke bheetar kaid rahane se shahari yuvaaon ko motopa gher rahaa he
 Even in the 21st century, inter-caste or inter-religious marriages are not getting place, and safe love is called jihad in the spirit of hatred
 ant main, naagarik sevaaon tak pahunch simit hi bani rahati he
 Three supply-intensive sectors (education, health and housing) account for 37 per cent of India's core inflation, which makes India unique in the sense that its fiscal policy determines its monetary policy as well
 iskaa aitihaasik samaadhaan ek do str vaala bazaar rahaa he
 The affluent and powerful have continued to have access to the private market or to the availability of preference for public property
 garibon ko yaa to zyada bhugtan karnaa padataa rahaa he yaa phir unhen seva main antar ko bardaasht karnaa padaa he
 From admission to school to hospital bed, they have to scrutinize the rate
 lekin aisa aage nahin chal paaegaa
 Our political functioning has to be made more transparent
 sudhaar kaa mantra upar se neeche tak loktantrdo kaarak madadgaar ho sakate hai
 Democracy should be expanded to a very low level and the attitude of the government changed
 rajnatik dalon ne chunaavon ko jeetne ke liye nae bijness model ke saath prayog karne shuru kar die hai
 It involves direct communication with the people, tailoring the message to suit local areas, and managing voting booths to reach voters at the end
 jald hi smart matadaata nateezon kii apeksha rakhenge
 Conscious voters can use likes and dislikes to allocate policies and capital through technology and expectations
 neeche se aane vaala loktantr aakhirkaar upar se thope jane vaale netaaon kii paripati ko tod saktaa he
 There are many state elections to be held in 2018 and in these we can see the youth having high expectations in front of candidates and parties
 rajnatik netaa jaruri hai lekin paryaapt nahin hai
 India needs active, advanced civic institutions that can be the custodians of society, play the role of honest intermediaries between business and the state, and assure that people remain vigilant about their responsibilities and rights
 aisi pahal kii shuruyaat ke liye 2018 acha saal he, kyonki is baar lakhon kii sankhya main pehali baar vot dene vaale bhi hai
 Indian people do not hate the rich
 yakeenan, sampann bananaa aksar unke sapanom kaa hissaa hota he
 But they do not want to feel that the rich and political leaders (they usually have collusion) have cheated in their game
 ve yah yakeen karnaa chaahate hai ki unke bacchon ke paas bhi kaamyaab hone ke maukey hon
 Non-equalization in the availability of growth opportunities can damage India's growth story
 kushal netaa is baat ko aashwast karne kii koshish karenge ki yah khel eemaandaaree se khelaa jaae
 Otherwise India's development story may end prematurely
 irina vittal maikinje kii purv partner hai or bharat main shaharikaran or krishi par kaaphi kaam kar chuki hai The treatment of 'NH10' has been kept real which sounds good and its action is also close to reality which combined with the theme of the film leaves an impressive impression
 gaanon kaa istemaal sahi dhang se kiya he filmkaar ne
 Though you do not remember the songs, they do not knock in the film and are also melodious
 har seen main jabardastee becoground mujeec jabardastee kaa naa thuns kar nirdeshak ne aklmandi kii he or ye asardaar bhi he
 So overall 'NH10' is a good film and from my side it's 3
 5 star
 The body of the young man recovered from the park in a rotten street expressed the murder of the neighborhood boys

 ek sipaahi se hi poocha jaae ki wo kahaan ja rahaa he
 This question will not be answered by those who spread the frenzy of war
 ham kisi sipaahi ke bare main tabhi jaanate hai jab wo shahadat kaa praapt hota he
 The inevitability of war and the futility of war are debatable worldwide but a soldier never crosses his line of duty
 wo vahaan se bhaag bhi nahin saktaa
 He has to die or be killed
 wo kitaab nahin padhata he
 He hears the order
 mahanagaron ke log tivi or twitor par bhavuk ho rahe hai, lekin main un logon ko dekh bhavuk ho gaya, jo apane gharon se nikal somvaar se lekar mangalvaar tak tamaam jagahon par shaheedon kii antim yatraaon main shaamil hote rahe
 a small salute is also made for these people who do not wait for a minister to come but walk towards the martyr's house in the village or town
 kahin mombatiyaan lekar nikal padate hai, kahin zile ke adhikari raily kaa netritv karne lagate hai to kahin skool ke bachche juluus kii shakl main peeche-peeche chalane lagate hai
 Of these, one may not be chanting patriotism on Twitter, but these are the people who must have waited for the martyr's body for hours
 ek noujvaan jab sainik banataa he to akelaa banataa he lekin jab wo desh ke liye kaam aa jaataa he to uski antim yatra main wo log bhi aa gaye lagate hai jo kabhi us sipaahi ke bare main jaanate tak nahin honge
 Where do we care that our soldier General bogie or second class, by returning to the place, returns home
 kitna achche hai na ye log jo apane ghar se nikle hai kisi sipaahi ko vidaa karne
 Say goodbye america ke videsh mantri jon kairi ne pakistan ke pradhanmantri nawaz sharif se kaha he ki ve apni dharti ko aatankwaadiyon kaa thikaana na banane den
 What happens by saying kya kairi ne koi pehali baar ye baat kahi hogi
 Well kya ham nahin jaananaa chahenge ki hamaare sainik kahaan se aate hai
 How are their villages

 How to tell that it was the birthday of Shaheed Havildar NS Rawat on Tuesday and he was cremated on the same day
 hamen nahin maaloom ki koi jawan goli khaane ke is jazbe ko kaise apane seene se chipka letaa he
 He must have achieved this spirit through day and night practice, or suddenly this passion will be on his heart and mind
 2014 ke chunaavon ke dauraan ghazipur zile ke paas gahammer gaanv gaya tha

 nambiar jodate hai, "industry main sweekaaryata ab zyada he
 Whatever be the caravan, Salman will take his place

 ve kehete hai, "isse mujhe waisi filmein karne kii aazaadee mil jaati he jaisi karnaa chahta hum
 Salman Sukumaran, Fahd Fasil and Vineet Srinivasan are among the second generation actors of the film industry who have succeeded in their cinematic endeavors
 ve kehete hai, "main samajhataa hum ki kisi bhi abhinayta ke liye apni alag pahchaan bananaa jaruri he
 Salman, who has done 21 Malayalam films in six years, admits that uncertainty is still a big problem for him
 ve kehete hai, "ek ausat malayalam darshak ko mujhase bahut zyada aakankshaayen hai
 i can't do a bad film
 mujhe nahin pataa ki main acha hum bhi yaa nahin

 Sometimes seen in public for a short time and then mysteriously going for long, Rahul Gandhi has completely jumped into public life
 par itnaa to saaf he ki yah sab koi itani jaldbaaji main nahin hua
 Sonia Gandhi was unwell here for a long time
 unke damaad roberd wadra par bhrashtachar ke aarope lagane se parivaar ko sharmindagi kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In 2012 Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections, Rahul lost his luster because he managed to get the party only 28 out of 403 seats despite his full campaigning
 2007 main party ko 22 siten mili thim
 That is, just 6 more than last time
 congress ke netritv vaali upie-2 apni sabase kathin pariksha ke daur se guzar rahi he kyonki uske khilaaf lagaataar bhrashtachar or kushasan ke aarope lag rahe hai
 Now only 14 months are left for the next general elections
 aise main rahul ko parade ke peeche se baahar aana hi padaa
 There was no other option other than this
 “agle aam chunaav main congress kaa netritv koun sanbhaalega” is sawaal kaa jawaab to dhundia hi tha
 After accepting the post of Congress vice-president, who is considered number two in the party after Sonia, Rahul has assumed a very heavy responsibility
 congress kaarysmiti (seedblusi) ne 19 janvari ko jab upaadhyaksh pad ke liye unke naam kaa anumodan kiya to party ke varisht netaaon ne rahul ko gale lagaakar badi garmjoshi se unhen badhaaiyaan deen
 These leaders included Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Finance Minister P
P
 chidambaram or raksha mantri e
 K
 antni bhi shaamil the
 With a disheveled hair and a disoriented beard, Rahul had risen from the position of one of the party's 10 general secretaries to the number two position
 baharhaal, unhone raturaat shaayad kuch aatmamanthan kiya tha or unki maa ne unhen bhavukta bhari chetavanee di thi ki satta ek jehar kii tarah he
 Rahul also told this to the Congress leaders with moist eyes, who were deposited in Birla Auditorium in Jaipur on 20 January
 apane haathon main kaagaj ke panne liye ve apana bhaashan pard rahe the
 While his speech tried to please the old leaders of the party, there was an attempt to present a ray of hope for the restless youth and the depressed middle class
 unhone party ke saamne apana dil kholkar rakhte hue apni nijee kism kii yaadon kaa bhi zikr kiya
 He also spoke of his late father Rajiv Gandhi's reaction to the assassination of Indira Gandhi
 rahul ne apni 14 saal kii umr kii us ghatana ko yaad karte hue bataaya, “mujhe itnaa dukh hua, jitna pehle kabhi nahin hua tha
 i saw my father crying for the first time in my life
 meri najar main ve sabase bahadur insaan the, phir maine unhen rote hue dekha
 i saw that they were broken
 ”mana jaataa he ki unke pita thik unki hi tarah raajnneeti main nahin aana chaahate the
 Rahul said that "despite being broken inside, his father" showed "a ray of hope" to the people
 party main shakti kaa sanchaar karne ke liye yah paryaapt tha
 Rahul said in his speech that “the party is his life now
 ” puraa haul uthakar khadaa ho gaya tha
 Even senior party leaders sitting on the stage
 apane nae upaadhyaksh ko gale lagane ke liye unhone jaise line hi laga rakhi thi
 Party general secretary Janardan Dwivedi became so emotional that he started crying on Rahul's shoulder, finally Rahul gave him a handkerchief to wipe the tears
 party par ek baar phir gandhi parivaar kaa varchasv sthapit ho jane ke baad ab rahul ko apane vaade puure karne ke liye yojanaayen taiyaar kerani padengi
 The old leaders applauded his speech and he cried emotionally, but when Rahul said that he should work and otherwise he would have to see the way out, he must have been shocked inside
 atakalein lagaai jane lageen ki kya kuch varisht netaa baahar kiye jane vaale hai or rahul kii team main aakhir koun-koun hoga?rahul ke kareebi samajhe jane vaale party mahasachiv digvijay singh kehete hai ki nae upaadhyaksh ne jaipur shivi main mahatvapurn mudde uthaae
 In his words, “people will see how they work on organization reorganization, governance and development of regional leadership
 ” jab unase poocha gaya ki kya rahul loksabhaa chunaavon kaa dabaav jhelane ko taiyaar hai? is par ve thodaa-sa muskaraae or bole, “aakhir dabaav hi to aadmi ko nikharataa he
 When Rahul formally assumed the post of vice president at the party's headquarters at 24, Akbar Road in the capital on 23 January, he did not give any indication about his future plans
 congress ke chatukaar kaaryakartaaon or naare lagaati yuva brigade kii bheed jamaa thi
 The people in that noisy crowd were able to see only the smile that engraved Rahul's cheek and could hear so much that they do not believe in negative politics
 rahul ko apni yojana banani padegi or apni maa or apane bich jimmedaariyon kaa bantwaaraa karnaa hoga
 They have to act as a bridge between the emerging new generation and the old leaders of the Congress
 unhone bhale hi yah bataaya ho ki unki party band daravaaje ke peeche kaam karti he, lekin unki maa ke saamne to gupt tareeke se raajnneeti karne main maahir ahamed patel or khajaane kii chaabi rakhane vaale motilal vora par nirbhar hone ke sivaa or koi chaara nahin he
 The young mps, many of whom are now ministers, did not participate openly during the Delhi gang rape protests
 in logon ko janata ke bich kahin zyada vakt dena hoga kyonki unki peedi ne aam aadmi kii takat kaa andaja laga liya he
 Nothing came of Rahul's promotion at the Chintan camp in Jaipur
 jaipur ghoshnaa main chunaav se pehle ke saal kii chunautiyon par koi gaur nahin kiya gaya
 None of the issues Rahul spoke on were mentioned
 abhi yah mana jaae ki rahul jaanate hai ki party main kahaan gadabadi he
 They have to cure this mess

 (ye aankade 2019 world cap se pehle tak ke hai) Book Name - Being Salman Writer - Jasim Khan Prakash Prakash - Penguin Group Price - Rs 599 (hard Cover) 1) Salman Khan never talks openly about his personal life
 baat sangeeta bijlani se rishton main daraar kii ho yaa somi ali se pyaar ke baad takaraar kii
 Be it separation from Aishwarya Rai or disintegration after separation from Katrina Kaif
 salmaan kaa ek hi jawaab hota he ki vah beeti baton ko yaad kar saamne vaale kii khushhaal jindagi main koi dakhal dena nahin chaahate
 That is, a sensible person who understands emotions
 lekin agle hi pal salmaan par aarope hai ki vah apni ladi lav ke saath sakhti se pesh aate hai
 There are also allegations that Salman has also beaten his girlfriends on several occasions
 yani donon baaten ek-duusare se bilkul ulat
 2) Those who know Salman Khan believe that he can go to any extent in friendship
 yahi baat unase dushmani par bhi lagu hoti he
 The feud is now over after the friendship between Salman and Shahrukh
 salmaan khud kehete hai, 'har cheez kii expyri hoti he
 After the confrontation with Shah Rukh at Katrina's birthday party in 2008, Salman, who had said that he and Shahrukh can never be friends
 unheen salmaan or shahrukh ke bich ab karan-arjuna kii tarj par dosti or bhaichara dikh rahaa he
 But these same Salman have not yet pardoned Vivek Oberoi and ignored him even after publicly apologizing on behalf of Oberoi
 kah sakate hai ki nijee jindagi main kamobesh har morche par hamen do salmaan dekhne ko milte hai
 Apart from reel life, the big question in real life is that if Salman is like this then why is he like this? Journalist-turned-writer Jasim Khan's first book 'being Salman' focuses on this one question
 ek aam samaj he ki kisi bhi vyakti kii samaj or uskaa vyaktitv uske parivesh or ird-gird ke logon ke kaaran banati he
 Jasim starts his journey with this formula in mind
 kitaab kii sharuaat main hi vah yah bhi spasht karte hai ki yah koi jeevani nahin he
 Rather, i have tried to know about the 'sultan' of Bollywood who is always associated with controversies, why he is like that? How the same person is also the 'bad Boy' of Bollywood and the same 'bhaijaan' of everyone
 jawaab dhundhane kii kavayadajasim bataate hai ki is ek sawaal kaa jawaab dhundhane ke liye unhone teen saal tak shodh kiya
 Salman's father Salim Khan met his uncle Naeem Khan in Indore, Salman's childhood friends, cousins, aunts
 salmaan ke nae-puraane intervyuuj, unke bare main chhapi khabaron, un par chal rahe mukademon se jude logon se lekar itihaas ke un pannon kii bhi khaak chhaani jo salmaan ke purvajon ke afghanistan se bharat aane kii kahani kahati or sunaati he
 After extensive research, meeting a lot of people and investigating every truth and rumor about Salman, Jasim has brought 'being Salman' in about 200 pages
 lekin teen saal yani kareeb 1095 dinon ke 26,280 ghanton tak dimagi kasarat ke baavjood unki yah kitaab kai morchon par vifal nahin to kam se kam satahi jarur sabit hoti he
 Actually, Salman's fame is also the weakest aspect of his book and also the strongest
 kya he samasya, kahaan rah gai chooksaal 2015 main Salman Khan google par sabase zyada search kiye gaye persenality main se ek hai
 For the past 27 years, everything from his late morning wake up to late night or early morning sleep is discussed
 salmaan 27 disambar 2015 ko 50 saal ke ho gaye hai
 That is, out of 4 lakh 38 thousand hours of more than 18,250 days of his life, we know the details of a big part through newspapers, magazines, TV, website and now social media
 lekhak jasim khan ne bhi apni kitaab ke shodh ke liye bahut had tak inhen ko aadhaar banaaya he
 In such a situation, except Salman's ancestors and his school days in Indore, most things are known to Salman's fans
 jabaki sahi myne main yah kitaab unheen ke liye mahatv bhi rakhti he
 What is new in the book, Haseem deserves praise in the sense that the information he has included about Salman's ancestors in the book is possible only through intensive research and hard work
 khaskar salmaan ke dada abdul rashid khan or unke bhi dada abdul latif khan kaa parivaar sahit af-paak ilaake se bharat aane kii kahani
 Three generations of family to be enlisted in the army
 shahzadi begum kii diary
 All these help us to know his family and ancestors ahead of Salman
 kitaab main salmaan ke bachapan kii sharaaraten, indore main bhai or doston ke saath aam ke bagichon kii saiyr, tractor kii yatra or chachaa ko dekhakar body building ke chaske jaisi khub saare kisse kitaab kii taazgi ko banaae rakhte hai
 In the book, father Salim Khan's thinking about Salman, especially Salim Khan's comments and opinions on Salman's love affair, are new
 salmaan kaa industry main pravesh, suraj badjatya se pehali mulaakaat, 'maine pyaar kiya' main role or usase pehle stregal kii kahani, padhane laayak he
 Jasim also included in his book several photographs of Salman's childhood and his family, which is worth saving
 haalanki, or acha lagata agar saadhaaran kaagaj kii jagah in tasveeron ko glouci paper par prakashit kiya jaataa
 Salman's life and that at the Bandra Bandstand in Hotelkitab are also the talk of the c-rock Hotel at that time
 yah vahi hotel he, jahaan salmaan kii sangeeta bijlani se lekar somi ali se mulaakaat hui
 Some relationships broke, some broke
 isi hotel ke gym main mohanish bahal salmaan ke dost bane
 This was the period when Salman used to hide from family and do gym
 apane bahanoi atul agnihotri se bhi salmaan kii mulaakaat isi hotel main hui thi
 Here kamikisya kiske, how apart from the stories the author spends ink to find the answer, this book proves to be light there
 kyonki salmaan se jude jin muddon or sawaalon kaa jawaab unke prashansak jaananaa chaahate hai, uski padtaal main lekhak ne thodi jaldbaaji dikhaai he
 For example, the book tells the story of Salman's broken relationship through news and interviews, but there is no discussion of why this happened, what the circumstances were behind this happening
 thik isi tarah salmaan se jude vivaadon ko lekar bhi pathak ke taur par hamen utani hi jaankaree mil paati he, jitani ham ab tak khabaron ke madhyam se jaan paae hai
 Salman's grandfather, great-grandfather and great-grandfather's father are also comfortably mentioned by the author, but he is not as closely informed about the life of Salman's father, Salim Khan
 saleem khan kii jindagi ke do sabase bade pahalu- pehali patni or salmaan kii maa sushila charak se mulaakaat or duusari patni helen se pyaar or phir shaadi kii charchaa ek se do line main simatakar rah jaati he
 Unspoken Talk to Salman: This book has been written to understand Salman, but sadly, Salman could not be spoken directly to the book
 masalan, salmaan ke bare main hamen lekhak jo bhi jaankaree dete hai, vah pita saleem khan, chachaa naeem khan, chachee sufia khan, chachere bhaaiyon, bahanoi atul agnihotri, mohanish bahal se baatcheet or abhinayta se judi khabaron par aadhaarit he
 Why read if you are a fan of Salman or like him, then this book is definitely worth a read
 salmaan se judi khabaron, vivaadon ko ek baar bina dhunde padhanaa chaahate hai to yah kitaab aapke liye he
 If you want to know about some interesting stories from Salman's childhood, school days in Indore, high school and college days in Mumbai, then this book is for you
 kyon na padhebgar yah sochakar padhanaa chaahate hai ki salmaan kii nijee jindagi se jude sabase charchit maamalon ke bare main koi andar kii baat pataa chalegi to yah kitaab aapke liye nahin he

 When Aamir was divorced, he was 37, Hrithik's 40 and Farhan's 42

 The young age has passed and starts to miss the things that were with you at that time

 Psychoanalysts believe that in such a situation, you want something new
 koi aisi baat jo aapako phir se aapke puraane dinon kii yaaden taaja kara sake or pehle jaisaa ehsaas kara sake
 While the lower middle class struggles with this problem (it is a period of 3-10 years), the celebrities who live a blinding life choose the path of separation
 phir jivan kii shuruuaat yaa to kam umr ke saathi ke saath karte hai yaa phir vah akelaa rahanaa pasand karte hai, or apni javaani jaise din gujaarne kii koshish karte hai
 Apart from this, career pressure, success-failure and friends pressure also matter

 unhone uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kii bhi tarif kii
 This session was moderated by Anjana Om Kashyap
 'kai puraani manyataon ko nakaara he'rail mantri piyush goyal se jab poocha gaya ki pichley kuch chunaavon se rajasthan main jis party kii sarkaar rahati he, vah chunaav ke baad vaapasi nahin kar paati he, to unhen kaise vishwaas he ki bijepi soobe main vaapasi karegi
 On this, Goyal said- i understand that the people of Rajasthan had been waiting for this for many years, to form a government that can fulfill its aspirations
 bijepi ne centre or rajya main aisi sarkarein di hai, jo vikaas ke raste par teji se aage bad rahi hai
 On the day of Modi ji's nomination in Varanasi in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, many people had advised that this day is not good
 tab modi ji ne kaha ki ab to main usee din parchaa daakhil karuunga
 He did that as well
 aise hi upi ke siem ke noida ke daure ko lekar kai baaten kahi ja rahi thim
 But the UP CM went there
 is tarah ham logon ne kai puraani manyataon ko nakaara he
 On the question of the Congress's efforts to return to Rajasthan 'in the Congress pit led by Rahul ji', Goyal said- Congress leaders have accepted that, under the leadership of Rahul ji, the Congress went into the pit
 ab vahaan party vaapasi kii koshish kar rahi he
 Gehlot left the government with a loss of Rs 70-75 thousand crores
 chaahakar bhi itnaa ghaataa nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 'vasundhara gave electricity to every village', the minister, while counting the achievements of the Vasundhara government, said- i would congratulate Vasundhara Raje ji that the way he handled the power department in five years is a praise-worthy one
 unhone har gaanv tak bijli pahunchaai
 Electricity has reached 75 percent of the country's villages
 phir yogi adityanath ko aage kyon kiya?vasundhara raaje sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon ko gina rahe piyush goyal se jab poocha gaya ki rajasthan sarkaar itnaa hi acha kaam kar rahi thi to upi ke siem yogi adityanath ko yahaan prachaar ke liye kyon bulaayaa gaya, to unhone kaha- jahaan jisaki maang hoti he, us netaa ko bulaayaa jaataa he
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis was also called
 jahaan bhi hamase poocha jaataa he, vahaan log yahi kehete hai ki hamen yogi ji kii ek sabha de dijie, seat pakki ho jaaegi
 The same situation is with Modi ji, Amit Shah ji, Rajnath ji
 yogi ji ke netritv main uttar pradesh sarkaar shandaar kaam kar rahi he
 Why are you keeping Yogi in the realm of narrow thinking
 yogi modi ke uttaradhikari?panchayat ajtak main jab piyush goyal se yah poocha gaya ki kya bijepi yogi ko modi ji ke swaabhaavik uttaradhikari ke rup main dekh rahi he, to goyal ne jawaab diya- bijepi parivaarwaad vaali party nahin he
 We have cadre presidents, ministers and prime ministers here
 hamaare 11 karod kaaryakartaaon main se koi bhi kisi bhi pad par pahunch saktaa he
 As far as you are concerned about the successor, Modi ji is the best leader of the country at this time
 'payalat ko empi bhejnaa chahie'sachin payalat kehete hai ki kile se shashan khatm hoga, sadak par khadaa vyakti sarkaar chalaaegaa
 On this, Goyal said that Sachin ji should be sent to Madhya Pradesh
 vahaan ve yah baat karte to acha rahata
 Vasundhara ji has done a good job here
 'prachaar main vyast hai vasundhara'vasundhara ji ko ajtak panchayat main bhi aana tha, lekin ve nahin ain
 Asked the reason for this, the Union Minister said - Vasundhara ji is busy in campaigning
 amit shah ji najadik the, isliye aa rahe hai
 Farmers in poor condition? The condition of farmers cultivating garlic near Jhalrapatan, the assembly seat of Chief Minister Vasundhara, is bad
 kya yah baat party ko nuksaan pahunchaayegi? is par piyush goyal ne kaha- bijepi kii sarkaar ne kisaanon ko kai tarah kii suvidhaayen di hai
 This includes a variety of help including seeds, fertilizers, crop insurance schemes
 swoil health card or karj maafee jaise upaay bhi kiye gaye hai
 Our government has helped farmers through MSP
 hamane congress kii tulana main emspi par anaaj kaa 10 guna zyada prokorment kiya he

 'choti bheed ke saath khadaa kiya gaya andolan'piyush goyal ne kaha ki kuch dinon pehle aapke channel par dikhaaya gaya ki maharashtra ke kisaan bahut pareshaan hai
 They are coming to Mumbai
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ji ne kisaanon ke saath baithak kii
 i asked the Chief Minister how was the meeting
 So they said that agreement has been reached
 unhone mujhase kaha ki aap kisaanon ke lautne ke liye train kii vyavastha kar dijie
 i thought that so many farmers were seen on TV, so many trains would have to be arranged
 lekin baad main pataa chalaa ki sirf ek train main hi aaraam se baithkar kisaan ja sakate hai
 Meaning their number was very less
 yah choti bheed ke saath khadaa kiya gaya andolan tha
 Farmers are standing with us
 maine jitne daure kiye, un sabhi jagahon par kisaan khush hai
 44 lakh are not even unemployed? During the program Piyush Goyal was asked that Vasundhara Raje has said that 44 lakh jobs were given to the unemployed in Rajasthan
 is par sachin payalat ne kaha he ki itane to berozegaar hi pradesh main nahin hai
 On this, Goyal said - Now the nature of employment has changed in the world
 aaj puure vishwa main log alag-alag tareeke se rojgaar paa rahe hai
 i give an example of when a thermal plant takes place
 ek unit bijli banane main maan lo kisi khaas taadaad main rojgaar paidaa hota he
 But renewable energy generates 15 times more employment than that
 lekin thermal plant main paidaa hone vaale rojgaar kii ginati hoti he
 But those who generate renewable energy are not counted in employment
 alag-alag jagah rojgaar kaa swaroop alag hota he
 The employment opportunities in the country have increased so much that people are not getting
 mark jakarberg college se dropaut hote hue bhi naam kamaaya
 On the question of 'BJP is number 1 in advertising', he said - i testify that we are the biggest advertiser
 aaj desh kii koi rashtriya party he to vah sirf bijepi he
 We have the highest number of states and voters in the country
 jab har rajya main vigyaapan dena he to yah aankada aayega hi
 This is not the case with every party
 duusari baat- hamaare yahaan paardarshee tareeke se vigyaapan diya jaataa he
 There is no middleman
 is par poocha gaya ki to aapkaa kaam bolta he yaa vigyaapan? iske jawaab main goyal ne kaha-vigyaapan main kaam hi to bolta he
 i handle railways
 pehle hajaaron kii taadaad main maanav rahit railway crossing thim
 We finished 3 thousand un-mand railway crossings within 6 months
 hamane puraani patariyaan badalakar nai patariyaan lagaayee
 We did many railway works in Rajasthan
 'acha hua manmohan ji ne bolnaa shuru kiya'purv piem manmohan singh ne maujuuda piem ko bhashaa kii garima banaae rakhane kii salaah di he
 When Piyush Goyal was asked about this, he said- 'we respect Manmohan Singh ji'
 acha he, unka bolnaa to shuru hua
 But when Manmohan Singh ji was PM, a leader of his own party tore the Cabinet note in a press conference
 ' unka ishaara rahul gandhi kii taraf tha
 Goyal further said- 'A leader of the Congress party says don't speak Bharat Mata ki Jai, say Jai of a family
 ''congress baantati he, ham jodate hai'panchayat ajtak ke is satr main piyush goyal se poocha gaya ki aapaki party rahul gandhi kaa gotra puuchhati he, dabaav main unhen bataanaa bhi padataa he, to goyal ne jawaab diya- 'desh jati, dharm main baantne waalon ko kabhi maaf nahin karegaa
 Those who held Rajasthan back
 yahaan ke logon ko apamaanit kiya
 The public will keep him out of power
 aisi partiyon se janata bachegi
 The bjp's stand remains the same
 congress samaaj ko baantati he
 Under Congress rule, if you want a loan, you have to go on pilgrimage, then a religion will get preference
 bijepi ekmaatr party he, jiskaa vikaas desh ko baantta nahin he
 Our party never says that our development is for one society and not for another
 ''main bhi chahta hum ki ram mandir bane'piyush goyal se ankar anjana om kashyap ne poocha ki aapaki sarkaar main vikaas vagairah par aapako bolne ke liye aage kiya jaataa he, lekin ram mandir par kisi or ko bheja jaataa he
 Why this? So Goyal said- i too can speak on the Ram temple
 main chahta hum ki ayodhya main bhavy ram mandir bane
 If a decision is reached by consensus, good
 main chaahunga ki congress ke mitra mandir ke nirmaan main roda nahin atakaayenge
 'will return with 2 / 3 majority' Piyush Goyal was asked how many seats will BJP win in Rajasthan, he said- BJP will return to power in Rajasthan with 2 / 3 majority

 '' vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne shuukravaar ko pesh bajet main nayaa elaan karte hue kaha tha ki ab saal main 1 karod rupee se zyada nikasi karne waalon par 2 fisadi kaa TDS (strot par kaata gaya kar) dena hoga
 The finance minister has probably made this announcement to curb the movement of black money
 ek anumaan ke anusaar saal main aisi badi rakam jamaa karne vaale log, form aadi kii sankhya kareeb 1
 75 lakhs
 times of india ke mutabik saal 2017-18 main 1
 More than 75 lakh entities (people, companies, institutions etc
) have withdrawn more than Rs 1 crore in a year
 isamen kuch hissaa kanoon sammat tareeke se sahi he, to kuch galat bhi hai
 Some such withdrawals are legitimate money of ATM managing companies, traders etc
, while many examples are also of money withdrawn by wrong people
 kai maamalon main aisa dekha gaya ki iske liye jis pan kaa ullekh hua vah farji tha
 Now, by imposing a TDS of 2% on such withdrawals, the government is hoping that all such people, firms will be monitored and these people will be forced to state the correct PAN as they would like to adjust it at the time of payment of advance tax
 akhbaar ke anusaar, saal 2017-18 main ek lakh se zyada PAN dharakon ne 1 se 2 karod rupee salanaa cash nikaale
 Apart from this, there were about 500 entities who withdrew more than Rs 100 crore cash from their accounts
 mulya ke hisaab se dekhen to kul nikasi kaa kareeb aadha hissaa 100 karod rupee se zyada nikasi karne waalon kaa hi tha
 It is important to note that the government keeps an account of all the current accounts from which withdrawals of Rs 50 lakh or more are made
 iske alaava, bank kuch bachat khaaton kaa hisaab-kitaab bhi sarkaar ko dete hai
 The government also wants to encourage digital transactions by reducing the movement of cash, and this proposal of the budget is also a step in that direction
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki zyaadaatar kaarobaariyon, companiyon ko badi maatra main nakadi nikaalane kii jarurat nahin hoti, kyonki ab online transfar kaa istemaal zyada ho rahaa he
 In his budget speech, the Finance Minister said, "withdrawal of cash of more than one crore rupees from a bank account in a year will attract a TDS of two percent
 in praavdhaanon ko prabhavi banane ke liye iskar adhinium or bhugtan evam niptaan pranali adhinium, 2007 main aavashyak sanshodhan kiye ja rahe hai
 The Finance Minister said that there are many digital payment systems like Bhima UPI, UPI-QR Code, Aadhaar Pay, NEFT and RTGS for low cost payments
