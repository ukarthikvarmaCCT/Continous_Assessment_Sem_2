 Low cost airlines in the country have been bringing more than one breathtaking fair offer in the recent past
 spicejet, jet airways, indigo jaisi nijee kshetra kii gharelu vimaan companiyon ke in ofer se public sector kii indian airlines bhi dabaav mahasoos karte hue apana ofer pesh karne par majaboor ho jaati hai
 The other aspect is that domestic airlines in the country are incurring losses due to low turnover, expensive maintenance and increased playing cost
 aise main yah companiyaan kaise 1 rupee se lekar 999 rupee main hawaii safar kaa ofer de sakati hai? jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki in ophers se companiyon kii balanceshit par asar nahin padataa or vah inhen mahaj apana pramotion activity maan kar chalate hai
 Therefore, to understand the meaning of these offers, it is necessary to understand these 4 things in the aviation sector of the country
 of sijan ke liye die jate hai yah fere ofrseeviation sector ke jaankaron ke mutabik desh main saal ke kai maheene of sijan ke rahete hai
 At such times, passenger traffic is very low on most domestic flights
 jahaan may-june jaise peak sijan maheenon main gharelu udaanon kaa lod factor (kitne paisangers ke saath udaan bhari ja rahi he) 75 se 90 fisadi rahata he vahiin of sijan main yah girakar 40 se 50 fisadi par aa jaataa he
 On some domestic routes, the passenger numbers fall so much that the problem of operating on them becomes a problem
 lihaaja, airline apni sabhi ophers in of sijan maheenon ke liye laate he jisase kuch nayaa trephic joda ja sake
 Most offers are given on low traffic routes, usually domestic airlines offer low cost offers only on select routes on which traffic is very low
 industry ke jaankaron ke mutabik airlines ko kisi bhi root par oparate karne ke liye jahaaj kaa kiraaya, airport par parking chargees, aviation ful kaa bhugtan jaise kharchon ko saal bhar vahan karnaa padataa he or in kharchon par trephic hone or na hone kaa asar nahin padataa
 Hence, airlines are compelled to fly on such routes even in the off season
 america or europe se alag he bharat kii industriamerica or europe jaise deshon main gharelu udaane achche munaafe par oparate karti hai
 This is because the railway network there is not as large as that of Bharat
 america main ek rajya se duusare rajya kii yatra karne main hawaii safar karnaa rail safar se sasta rahata he
 Also, the traffic of these countries has created a mindset to save time in travel for many decades
 vahiin bharat main abhi bhi sasti rail seva ke saamne mahange hawaii safar ko lagjri mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, airlines try to create their new traffic base by enticing passengers from the top segment of the railway (AC First and AC Second) through these offers
 lo cost ofer main yatriyon se vasuul liya jaataa he taxof sijan or kam trephic vaale root par airlines 1 rupee, 755 rupee, 999 rupee jaise ophers pesh karti he
 Through these offers, where the airlines are getting free publicity, they are also getting a new traffic base
 iske alaava, in ophers ke jariye tikat booking karaane waalon se vastav main yah lo cost tikat kaa paisa tex jodakar vasula jaataa he
 This tax includes expenses such as parking charges and aviation fuel at the airport
 lihaaja airlines ke liye in kam trephic vaale roots par of sijan ke dauraan bas oparating cost nikaalane kaa dabaav rahata he jise vah tex ke rup main nikaal lete hai

 Both are equal
 donon kii bhoomikaayen alag, lekin kisi ko bhi ek—duusare se kamatar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Then how does it happen that when it comes to raising children, the mother stands there first
 yah keval saamaajik vyavhaar main hi nahin he
 We have continued to believe it as a policy too
 pitrutv kii bhoomika ko vyavasthaaon or praavdhaanon ne simit karke rakhaa he
 According to the latest UNICEF report, India is among the 90 countries in the world where there is no national policy on paternity
 isiilie nijee dhaanchon main to navjaat bacchon kii dekhbhaal or unke saath samay bitaane ke liye paryaapt vaitanaik chhuttiyon tak kaa praavdhaan nahin ho paaya he
 Not only India, but according to the report, there are about two-thirds (9 crore) new-born children in the world whose fathers do not get a single day off
 hamen yah baat sochni chahie ki bharat duniya ke un samvedansheel deshon main he jahaan ki navjaat mrityu dar ek badi chunauti bani hui he
 It is like a big stigma, but why only one side should be involved in the measures to deal with it
 fadars de jaise maukey keval kahani—kavita or badhai sandeshon ke liye hi to nahin ho saktaa
 It cannot also be a fictional world just like fairy tales, where we can prove the kuppa by praising the father
 pita kii bhoomika asal main nibhaane ke liye kuch or bhi kaam karne honge
 We may greet the fathers on Father's Day with greetings, but will they be ready for any dialogue on their challenges and problems? bharat main bacchon kii sthiti vaise hi najuk he
 Even more so for newborns
 dekhie ki bharat main varsh 2008 se 2015 ke bich aath saal main 62
 4 million newborns have died
 janm ke 28 din ke andar marane vaale in bacchon kii yah sankhya thodi nahin he
 Four states of the country (uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh) account for 56 percent of the total number of newborn deaths in the country
 ek maheene se paanch saal kii umr main bacchon kii mrityu kaa jitna jokhim hota he, usase 30 guna zyada jokhim in 28 dinon main hota he
 Therefore, it is best to give children more protection, more attention and pampering to minimize the danger of children in these 28 days, but where does it happen
 apane aasapaas hi dekh lijie
 How many fathers are able to get systematically holidays for this, or other facilities
 tippaniyan Due to the increasing number of single-family and employed women, the crisis of childbearing on children has increased severely
 paramparaon main garbh se lekar maatrutiv ko praapt hone tak or uske baad ek navjaat shishu kii parvarish ke jo taane—bane the, vah bhi to iske saath hi saath bikhar rahe hai
 The society is not only losing the relationship with it, it is also losing what was better and temperamental according to the Indian environment, so the things that used to come through the generations in practice are missing

 The World Health Organization believes that premature birth of a child is a major cause of death and some form of disability in life
 ab is baat par bhi gaur kiya janaa chahie ki samay purv janm lene vaale bacchon kii kya chunautiyaan hoti hongi
 After all, why should this situation become such that large numbers are already being born
 or yadi ho bhi rahe hai to aisi paristhitiyon main pitaaon kii bhoomika kahin badhkar ho jaati he, kyonki janm dene vaali stri ke paas us paristhiti ko bhugatne ke sivaay bahut vikalp nahin hote, lekin aisi paristhitiyon main nirnay lene se lekar use anjaam tak pahunchaa dene kaa kaam to keval pita kaa hota he
 This may not be noticed, but paternity goes through the same challenges as motherhood
 vaise is baat par ab charchaa shuru ho gai he
 It is also being considered that paternity should be given a systematic form and brought into law provisions and policies

 An occasion like Father's Day cannot be just for story-poems and congratulatory messages

 To play the role of a father actually has to do some more work
 ham fadars de par pitaao ko bhale hi badhaayion se gulzaar kar den, par kya unki chunautiyon or samasyaon par bhi kisi samvaad ke liye taiyaar honge
 The situation of children in India is equally critical
 navjaat bacchon kii to or bhi zyada
 See that 62 in eight years between 2008 and 2015 in India
 40 lakh navjaat shishu mrityu kaa shikaar hue hai
 This number of these children who die within 28 days of birth is not small
 desh ke chaar rajyon (uttarapradesh, rajasthan, bihar or madhyapradesh) main desh kii kul navjaat mauton kii sankhya main se 56 pratishat mautein darj hoti hai
 At the age of one month to five years, the risk of death of children is 30 times more than the risk of these 28 days
 isliye sabase behatar he ki in 28 dinon main bacchon ke khatre ko kam se kam karne ke liye unhen zyada suraksha, zyada dhyaan or laad—pyaar diya jaae, lekin aisa ho kahaan paata he
 Look around you

 partiyon kaa aarope he ki kisi ward main tees hajaar kii aabaadi he to kisi ward main 80 hajaar tak pahunch rahi he
 Mahesh Giri said that we have been talking to the State Election Commission for half an hour and we have been told that these things will be taken care of and we have been fully assured that the boundaries of the assembly will not be violated and that is why we have demanded That the delimitation be repeated

 13 arab logon ke paas mobile he
 (source: ITU, Global Web Index) It took 48 years for mobile to reach five billion people and 28 years for the Internet to connect with four billion people, but social networks only 3 in a decade
 19 arab logon tak pahunch gaye
 Why did the speed of social networks spread faster than the craze of search on the internet? Did people want more opportunities to ask, to tell, that is, to communicate, that is, the secret of the amazing speed of social networks, twenty-first century society, politics , Is hidden in the structure of economics
 internet kii duniya yakeenan printing press vaali duniya se kahin zyada loktantric ho gai thi, phir bhi yah samvaad loktantr ke janm (16-17veen sadi) se aaj tak ekatarfa hi to tha
 Social networks brought two-way and direct communication facilities
 or loktantr puraa ho gaya
 People could now ask questions directly to those who were responsible
 ve jawaab na bhi den lekin logon ke sawaal sabko pataa chal sakate hai
 Why freedom to ask questions is big freedom? The answer lies in the formation of constitutional democracies
 sansadeey loktantr aaj bhi is baat par rashk karata he ki uske numaayinde apane pradhanmantri se sidhe sawaal kar sakate hai
 More than one model of democracy has developed in the twenty-first century
 lekin inke tahat aazaadiyon main gaharaa fark he
 Whether Russia or Singapore, elections are held everywhere, but there is no freedom to ask the government the questions that are there in Britain, America or India
 isliye achraj nahin ki jaise hi soshal network faile, bhashaaen aade nahin ain or un deshon ne inhen sabase teji se apanaaya jinamein loktantr naganya yaa simit tha
 The printing press reached the Arab country at the earliest, but Facebook Twitter revolutionized it

 Affidavits before contesting elections, long question periods in Parliament, Parliamentary committees, auditors, parliamentary committees on auditors' reports, special inquiry committees, exemption to challenge every law in court, courts asking questions, opposition, media
 
 
 in sabase guzarate hue tii bag (sarkaar) ko badalane yaa phenkane (chunaav) kii baari aa jaati he
 Seeing the pending cases in the courts of India, it would seem that people do not trust the government at all! People keep the government in the dock
 yani ki jo sawaal kanoon banaate samay numaide nahin puch pate, unhen logon kii ore se adaalatein puuchhati hai
 This chronicle of questions in democracy has been woven only for governments
 vajah yah ki log puure hosho-havaas main kuch logon ko khud par shashan karne kii chhot dete hai or apni bachaten va tex unhen saunp dete hai
 Governments run away from questions and the institutions of democracy keep them from questioning
 ikkisvin sadi main ab chunaav kii aazaadee hi loktantr nahin he, chune hue ko sawaalon main kasate rahane kii aazaadee ab sabase badi lokshahi he isliye jaise hi soshal network faile, logon ne samooh main sawaal poochne prarambh kar die
 The system of questions is now becoming completely democratic
 kyon keval patrkaar hi kathor sawaal puuchhen? loktantron main ab aisi samskruti viksit karne kaa mauka aa gaya he jab prayek vyakti ko sarkaar se kathor se kathor prashn poochne ko prerit kiya jaae
 This illusion of power should be broken every time that those who are curious or curious are not foolish
 or kai baar sawaal, javaabon se kahin zyada moolyawaan hote hai

 Reacting to this statement, Sunil Gavaskar said that the Indian team used to win even when the current captain (virat Kohli) was not even born
 haalanki kolkata main khele gaye aitihaasik de-nite test main bharat kii bangladesh kii jeet ke baad sunil gavaskar ne kaha ki yah match behad shandaar rahaa
 Sunil Gavaskar said that the Indian captain said that playing well in Test cricket started in 2000 with Sourav Ganguly's team
 mujhe pataa he ki saurav ganguli bisisiai ke adhyaksh hai, isliye shaayadviraat kohli unke bare main acchhee baaten kahana chaahate the
 But India was also winning in the 70s and 80s
 us vakt unka(viraat kohli) kaa janm bhi nahin hua tha
 What was Virat's statement? Actually, after India's great win in the second Test match against Bangladesh, Virat Kohli said that India has learned to face challenges and it all started with the team of Dada (sourav Ganguly)
 bhartiya captain ne match or siries jeetne ke baad kaha tha ki ab hamane khadaa hona sikh liya he
 It started in the era of Dada (sourav Ganguly), which we are pursuing
 purv bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ke liye ipel 10 kii shuruyaat acchhee nahin rahi
 lbw's appeal in the match between Pune and Mumbai Indians played on Thursday has been reprimanded for pointing out the demand for DRS
 match referi ne ipel kii aachaar samhita todane ke liye yah fatkaar lagaai gai he
 Level 1 (article 2 above Mahendra Singh Dhoni)
 1
 Action has been taken under 1), which is against the spirit of the game
 haalanki abhi dhoni par koi jurmaana nahin lagaaya gaya he
 What was the matter when Mahendra Singh Dhoni was wicket-keeping, the umpire refused when lbw's appeal was made against Kieron Pollard during the 15th over of Mumbai's innings
 jiske baad dhoni ne ampire se rivyuu maanga, or sabhi yah dekh kar chaunk or hans pade
 DRS is not in IPL, let us tell you that Dhoni is neither the captain of the team, and the review system DRS is not applicable in IPL
 rivyuu system sirf antarrashtriya maichon main lagu hota he
 Out were Pollard Dhoni was sure Pollard was out, but the umpire did not give him out
 baad main jab tivi riple dekha gaya tha, to pollard out hi the
 Meaning if the DRS was there, Dhoni's decision would have been correct
 petersan kii bolti bandaisase pehle fielding ke dauraan hi dhoni ne camentator kevin petersan kii bolti band kar di
 Actually, Peterson was talking to Manoj Tiwari during the commentary, so he asked Dhoni standing near him to say that Pietersen is a good golfer
 to dhoni ne unhen jawaab diya ki to kya hua, vah phir bhi meraa pehla test wicket he

 Also factual and political understanding is required
 yah jimmedaari ek patrkaar hi bakhubi nibhaa saktaa he
 Dr
 anjani kumaar jha kii kitaab aatankwaad or media ko padhate hue yah mahasoos hota he ki unhone apni jimmedaari bakhubi nibhaai he
 They begin with basic definitions such as "what is terrorism"
 kitaab kii bhoomika main likhaa he, ‘‘rajtantr, adhinayakawad, taanaashaahee, samrajyavad, samantvaad or loktantr main tantra ke bhrasht hote dhaanche se aatankwaad ke beej ne vrikshakaar rup le liya
 "actually terrorism is not a problem of any country or community
 afghanistan, cuba, vietnam, israel, misr, falstin or ireland se lekar bharat-pakistan tak duniya ke bahut saare mulk aatankwaad ke shikaar hai or iske peeche mukhya kaaran satta kii raajnneeti he
 Many times the main reason behind terrorist attacks has been to establish their power
 kitaab kaa pehla hi adhyay bhartiya upmahadweep main aatankwaad kii paribhaasha or kaarnon kii vyakhya karata he
 India inherited Kashmir's problem with Partition
 bharat-pakistan vibhaajan ne ek lambey vivaad kii neenv pehle hi din rakh di thi
 The partition of Bangladesh then sliced this land
 kitaab bataati he ki kaise padosi mulk ke saath tanaavpurn sambandhon or donon deshon main fail rahe aatankwaad kii vajah in mulkon ke itihaas or siyasat main he
 Determining the role of the media in times of terrorist incidents is not an act of less responsibility
 aisi ghatnaon kii reporting kai baar aatankiyon ke liye bhi madadgaar ho jaati he
 "terrorism has emerged as an information crime at the present time," Jha writes
 ’’ chunki janamat nirmaan main media kii badi bhoomika hoti he, isliye khabaron kii reporting bahut soch-samajhakar honi chahie
 There are many references in the book, from theoretical books to newspaper news and articles
 kul milakar kitaab aatankwaad jaise mudde par ek samgr drushti detii he
 The dispute of the judges' press conference is probably beginning to be resolved
 aarope the ki jajon ko kaam karne kii aazaadee nahin he
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to know how the cases are allotted in the Supreme Court
 Four judges of the Supreme Court have accused the Chief Justice of sidelining seniority in allotment of cases
 vaise, mukhya nyaayadhish ke paas cese alot karne kaa ekadhikaar hota he
 Earlier, the bench headed by CJI overturned the judgment of Justice Chelameswar
 niyam kahata he jis par abhi haal hi main samvidhan peeth ne muhar bhi lagaadi he ki chif justise master af roster hota he
 That is, the Chief Justice only has the right to decide which case will go in a bench or who will hear the judge
 yahi vyavastha ucch nyaayalayon main hoti he
 The Chief Justice is also the leader there
 kuch dinon pehle jab justise chelmeshwaraki adhyakshata vaali peeth ne jajon ke naam par rishwatakhori cese kii sunwaayee paanch jajon keepith ko hastantarit karne kaa aadesh diya tha to usee din aanan-fanan pradhan nyaayadhishadipak mishra kii adhyakshata main paanch jajon kii peeth ne justise chelmeshwar kii peeth kaa voadesh radd kiya tha
 Not only this, the bench headed by the Chief Justice gave the order that the Chief Justice is the master of the roster and only he can decide which bench will hear which case
 isliye aaj kii taarikh main yahi kanoon he aurayahi vyavastha chali aa rahi he

 india today ke saath ek vishesh intervyuu main viraat kohli ne kaha ki vah bahut bhaagyashaalee hai ki unke paas stump ke peeche mahendra singh dhoni jaise khilaadi hai
 Also it is unfortunate to see that many people criticize him
 saal 2018 main mahendra singh dhoni kii captaini main chennai super kings ne bain ke baad joardaar vaapasi karte hue teesraa ipel kaa khitaab apane naam kiya tha
 Whereas before this, in 2017, he faced several criticisms during poor form

 Virat Kohli told India Today, "dhoni is a player who understands the game from the first ball to the 300th ball on the field the best
 ' viraat kohli ne kaha, 'main yah nahin kahuunga ki yah unke liye ek suvidhajanak cheez he
 Rather i am fortunate because behind the stumps we have a person with a great cricketing mind like Dhoni
 team management kii adhiktar ranneetiyon main main maahi bhai or rohit ke saath shaamil hona chahta hum
 "in the death overs, i know that i have to be in the outfield to do something for the team," Kohli said
 kyonki yah meraa swabhaav he ki main team ke liye kuch karnaa chahta hum bajaay iske ki vahaan kuch ho
 'kohli said,' After 30 -35 overs, Dhoni knows that i am in the outfield and all goes into auto mode
 dhoni khud hi kaman sambhaal lete hai
 It is just a matter of change in field placement and bowling
 ham kehete hai ki aap (dhoni) sabhi angel ko jaanate hai, aap pich kii gati jaanate hai or isiilie vahaan aapse behatar or koi nahin he
 'kohli said,' There is so much trust and respect between us
 yah dekhnaa durbhagyapurna he ki bahut se log unki aalochana karte hai
 Virat Kohli made his debut for India as a young cricketer under the captaincy of MS Dhoni
 kohli aaj puure ballebaaji kaa campalit package hai

 3 position
 kohli ne kaha, ‘jab main team main aayaa tha unke paas kuch maichon ke baad duusare khilaadiyon ko aajamaane kaa vikalp tha
 Although i missed my chance, it was important for me to get such support

 medical council of india (emsiai) kii jagah neshnal medical kamishan (enemasi) bill ko modi sarkaar rajyasabha main bhi paas karaane main kaamyaab rahi
 Against this bill, doctors across the country took to the streets and most of the doctors were on strike on Thursday
 ab sawaal yah uthta he ki jab desh main pehle emsiai thi to enemasi kii jarurat kyon mahasoos kii gai
 The NITI Aayog objected that the doctors' lobby is active in MCI, so it deviates from its original purpose
 virodh ke baavjood sarkaar guuruuvaar ko rajyasabha main yah bill paas karaane main kaamyaab ho gai jabaki 29 july ko loksabhaa main yah bill paas ho gaya tha
 The National Medical Commission will be set up in the next 3 years after the bill is passed
 centre kii modi sarkaar ne emsiai kii jagah neshnal medical kamishan bill ke jariye koun se nae praavdhaan jod die jis kaaran aakhir itnaa virodh kiya ja rahaa he
 Rationale 1 for the National Medical Commission bill
 neshnal medical kamishan bill taiyaar karne vaale niti ayog ko aitraaj tha ki emsiai main zyaadaatar doctor chunaav chaahate hai jis kaaran doctoron kii lobby sakriy rahati he aise main ve mul makasad par dhyaan nahin de pate
 2
 emsiai ke paas medical ajukeshan or doctoron kii practice jaise 2 bade kaam nahin hone chahie
 3
 2016 main emsiai par bani stading cameti ne kaha ki emsiai kaa sara focus collejon ko license dene par rahata he jisase padhai kii behatari prabhavit hoti he
 MCI dissolved in 2017 Based on the objections, the central government started preparing for the formation of NMC by dissolving MCI in 2017
 2017 main supreme court ne emsiai kii gatividhiyon par najar rakhane ke liye nigaraanee cameti banaai thi
 The Monitoring Committee had then told the Ministry of Health that MCI was in violation of the orders of the Supreme Court
 iske baad centre sarkaar ne adhyadesh laakar emsiai kii management cameti ko bhang kar diya tabase medical council of india (emsiai), board of gavarnence ke jariye sanchalit hota he
 The National Medical Commission (NMC) bill was introduced in Parliament to improve the system in the medical field
 bill ke paas hone ke baad sthitiyaan badal jaaengi
 Till now MCI used to have work related to admission, medical education, registration of doctors, but now after passing this bill all this work will go to NMC
 is tarah se emsiai kii jagah neshnal medical kamishan le legaa
 After the formation of National Medical Commission, the Central Government will suggest the name of the chairman of this commission, who will be elected for 4 years
 dobaaraa uski niyukti nahin hoti thi
 Whereas in MCI, the doctor was the chairman and he could become the president many times
 praavdhaan jiskaa virodh ho rahaa1
 Under the 32nd provision of the National Medical Bill, community health providers will be given the license to prescribe medicines and treat patients
 jabaki is par doctoron ko aapatti he kyonki isse marijon kii jaan khatre main pad jaaegi
 2
 is bill main ek praavdhaan yah bhi he ki ayurveda-homeopathy doctor brij course karke allopathic ilaaj kar paaenge
 While doctors say that this will give a boost to quacks and hawks
 3
 Private medical colleges will get the right to fix fees for 50 percent seats
 jabaki doctoron kaa kahana he ki isse privet medical collejon main bhrashtachar ko badhaava milegaa
 4
 praavdhaan ke anusaar padhai puri karne ke baad practice shuru karne ke liye doctoron ko ek test paas karnaa hoga
 On the other hand, doctors say that once the test fails, there is no option to give the test again
 kya he sarkaar kaa pakshasarkaar kaa kahana he ki neshnal medical kamishan desh main doctoron kii kami ko dur karne main sakasham hoga
 1
 sarkaar kaa tark he ki is bill ke aane se primary health workars ko 6 maheene kaa medical course karke practice karne kaa license mil jayega
 With which they will be able to prescribe treatment and medicines
 isse gramin kshetron main logon ko khaasi raahat milegi
 2
 brij course ke jariye simit allopathy practice kaa adhikaar sirf un aayush doctoron ko milegaa jinke paas practice kaa license ho
 3
 is bill main yah bhi praavdhaan kiya gaya he ki bina license medical practice karne vaale doctoron ko ek saal kii jail or 5 lakh tak jurmaane kii vyavastha he
 4
 privet medical collejon ko 50 fisadi siton kii fees tay karne kaa haq dene se aarthik tangi se band hone kii naubat nahin aegi
 5
 desh main embibies kii maujuuda 76 hajaar siton main se 58 hajaar siton par fees sarkaar hi tay karegi
 Now after the National Medical Bill is passed in the Rajya Sabha, the way for its law to be made in a few days has been cleared
 sarkaar chaahati he ki naaraaz doctor waapas aa jaaen
 The government says that it is in his and the new generation's interest
 aise samay main jab desh main doctoron kii sankhya main baari kami he, sarkaar is bill ke jariye doctoron kii kami puraa karnaa chaahati he, lekin doctoron kaa virodh-pradarshan jari he
 Now it has to be seen what kind of change in the medical field in the country after the National Medical Commission becomes law
 bhaajapa main mache antarkalah ke bich rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa maananaa he ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main party ko agar congress ko patkhni deni he to aisa keval gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kii aguwai main hi kiya ja saktaa he
 It says that like former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Modi has the ability and charisma to expand bjp's vote base in the country
 sangh ke mukhpatr argeniser ke tazaa ank main ‘raajnneetik vishaleshan’ stambh ke tahat chape lekh main kaha gaya he, ‘congress party kaa bhagya teji se gir rahaa he lekin bhaajapa ke netritv vaale rajg kaa congress ke is hraas kaa phayda uthaa paanaa bhi bahut mushkil najar aa rahaa he
 It said that Modi is the face of the BJP, which has the appeal of the party and the ability to expand its vote base across the country, as Atal Bihari Vajpayee did in the nineties
 bhaajapa kii rashtriya kaaryakarini ke sadsy or party ke chunaav vishleshak ji ve el narsimha raav ke is lekh main kaha gaya he ki uttarapradesh main bhaajapa kii haalat khasta he lekin modi hi aise netaa hai jo vahaan bhi party ko baari badhat dilaa sakate hai
 For the last few days, suddenly Modi is being projected as the bjp's prime ministerial candidate
 party kii andruni uthapatak main unka kad badhata najar aa rahaa he
 In a recent national executive meeting held in Mumbai, party president Nitin Gadkari had to bow to his condition that Sanjay Joshi be removed from the executive

 Political analysis said that in 1996 and 1999, bjp's allies had grown mainly because regional parties had acknowledged Vajpayee's ability to increase the vote base
 isamen kaha gaya he, ‘modi kii aguwai main yahi formula bhaajapa ke paksh main jayega

 ’’ isamen kaha gaya he ki aisa nahin kiya gaya to bhaajapa kaa satta main aana mushkil hoga or kisi tisare morche kii sarkaar banane kii sambhaavnaaen badhengi

 atal bihari vaajapeyi hameshaa apni bebaak bhaashan or bolne ke anokhe andaaj ke liye jane jate rahe he
 Atal was a successful leader as well as a successful poet
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ke unke saathi hi nahin balki unke virdohi bhi kaayal the
 Atal said many such things on many occasions which became memorable, see Vajpayee's thoughts while saying something similar
 
 
 1
 In the context of Pakistan, Atal had said that 'we can change our friends but we cannot change our neighbors'
 2
 For those who think that we will talk or compromise with Pakistan, i would just like to tell them that for the last 55 years only India has been trying to talk to Pakistan
 3
 Any nuclear weapon that we have is to end any nuclear attack and not to leave it to a country
 4
 i would just like to say that our politics is so tragic that if i had not been a strong person, i would have been suicidal by now
 5
 Democracy is a place where two fools together defeat a powerful human
 6
 Truth is your most powerful weapon and everyone knows that you cannot carry weapons in government places
 7
 If your country is powerful then no country will have the courage to show its eyes to you
 8
 The reality is that international organizations like the United Nations can be as effective as their members allow them to be
 9
 We hope that the world will work with a sense of enlightened selfishness
 10
 Poverty is multifaceted, it affects our earning, health, political participation and the advancement of our culture and social organization
 11
 During the rally in Mumbai, Atal had said that darkness will be lifted, sun will come out and lotus will blossom akasar film kalakaaron ko apni har nai film ke saath kuch nayaa to karnaa padataa he
 Ranvir Singh has done something similar

 He wanted this look for 'ram-leela' and even in 'gunday', he has been seen in some way
 lekin aakhirkaar vah din aa hi gaya, jab unhen apane is andaaj ko badalanaa padaa
 Of course, thousands of youth are adopting this style of theirs
 lekin ranvir ne bade hi andaaj ke saath is luk se peechha chhudaaya
 His fellow actors of 'gunday' Arjun Kapoor and the director of the film Ali Abbas Zafar helped give him a clean shave look
 beshak kaam aasaan nahin tha lekin ab ranivar singh nae andaaj main apane chaahane waalon ke aage aane ke liye taiyaar hai
 'ram-leela' has already become a superhit, and his next film 'gunday' is also very much liked in the trailer
 yani yah nayaa luk jarur rang laaegaa

 jis congress or bijepi ne privet skulon se santh ganth karke sarkari skulon ko barbaad kiya wo aaj wo aankadon ko todmarodakar dilli sarkaar ko badnaam karne kii koshish main lage hai
 1 / N— Manish Sisodia (@msisodia) November 28, 2017 In his second tweet, Sisodia said that my challenge is to tell the leaders of Congress and BJP, as much as we have done in the last two and half years of education in Delhi government, not a single state Give it where they have done it many times while still in government
 tisare twit main sisodiya baat aage badhaai ki congress or bijepi ke netaa ek bhi rajya bataa den jahaan unhone shiksha kaa bajet badhaaya ho, shikshakon kii antarashtriya training karwaai ho, sarkari skulon main dilli jaise aadhunik kamare banawaye hon
 The challenge is, tell one state in the whole country
 ham dilli main karke dikhaa rahe hai
 My challenge is to tell the leaders of the Congress and BJP, as much work as we have done in the two and a half years of education in the Delhi government, to tell a single state where they have done many times in the government
 2 / N— Manish Sisodia (@msisodia)november 28, 2017iske baad aakhri twit main sisodiya ne kaha ki bijepi or congress ke netaaon kaa ek hi ricard rahaa he- sarkari skulon ko barbaad karke apane privet skool kholo or abhibhavakon ko khulkar looto
 Tell a state where BJP and Congress have refunded fees from private schools till date
 aakhri twit main sisodiya ne bijepi ko khuleam chunauti di
 He said that if the BJP is really concerned about education, then IA contest
 aap emsidi ke skulon ko sudhaariye, ham dilli sarkaar ke skulon kii haalat sudhaar rahe hai
 Let's see who shows better government schools? IA Maidan- This challenge will benefit the education of Delhi

 With this, the Congress raised two questions
 pehle sawaal main congress ne poocha ki sarkari skulon se pehali baar 1 lakh chaatr kam hue or privet skulon main 1
 Why do 42 lakh students increase? Instead of talking here and there, tell that in 2017 as compared to 2014 - 1) For the first time, 1 lakh students fell from government schools and 1 in private schools
 42 lakh chaatr kyon bade?2)sarkari skulon se pehali baar 12th board main 38,000 chaatr kam,or privet skulon main 15,000 zyaada kyon paas hue?— Ajay Maken (@ajaymaken)november 28, 2017duusare sawaal main congress ne poocha ki sarkari skulon se pehali baar 12veen board main 38,000 chaatr kam or privet skulon main 15,000 zyaada kyon paas hue?ab dekhnaa he ki sisodiya congress ke is palatwaar kaa kya jawaab dete hai

 Two low-floor DTC buses caught fire in Delhi today
 ek ghatana jahaan prahaladapur ilaake kii he jabaki duusari ghatana akshardham ilaake kii he
 There was a sudden fire in the buses in both, although no passenger was reported dead due to the fire
 sabhi yatri surakshit hai
 Five buses have fallen victim to fire in the last 15 days
 prahladpur ilaake ke paas kuch aisa hi vaakya pesh aayaa
 As soon as the news was received, two fire brigade vehicles reached the spot and the fire was controlled
 subah ke samay is lo-floor sienji bas main kaaphi savaariyaan thim
 But as soon as the fire started, all the passengers got off safely and no one was harmed
 aag lagane ke kaarnon kaa abhi pataa nahin chal sakaa he
 In recent times there have been many incidents of fire in low-floor buses of DTC
 pichley pandrah dinon main ditisi kii bason main aag lagane kii yah paanchavi ghatana he
 On November 26, a DTC school bus caught fire
 new ashok nagar ke paas hui is ghatana main driver kii satarkta kii vajah se sabhi bacchon kii jaan bachi
 However the bus burned completely
 29 november ko aaramail aspataal ke paas ditisi kii ek lo-floor bas main aag lagi thi yah bas mongolpuri se railway stesan ja rahi thi
 After this, another incident occurred in Moti Nagar area on 3 December
 yahaan bhi ditisi kii lo-floor bas main subah subah aag lag gai
 Do not read this article for those who get hit by traffic jams
 is lekh ko ve bhi na padhein jo abhi tak yah sweekaar nahin kar saken hai ki trephic jam shahar nahin mulk kii aatma he
 Do not read this article even those who change the way due to traffic jam
 sirf ve padhein jo meri tarah jaanboojh kar kisi na kisi trephic jam main funsana pasand karte hai
 i am a traffic jam supporter
 main ab ghar nahin janaa chahta
 Does not want to go home from office
 jam se nikal kar jam main rahanaa chahta hum
 Before the life of the metropolis, i had no idea of a traffic jam
 ab to patna vaale bhi trephic jam or pressure horn kaa mazaa lene lage hai
 My love for traffic jams is not there today
 2008 ke saal main main apane blog kasbaa par ashram jam kaa romance naam se kahaniyon kaa silsilaa likhane laga
 He used to come out of the office every evening and get trapped in the ashram
 ghar jane kii jaldi dhire-dhire na pahunchane ke sabar main badalane lagi
 The uneasiness of going home started to end
 laga ki meri tarah baaki bhi ghar nahin janaa chaahate hai
 i started creating characters for my story among the people stuck in Ashram jam
 ye wo log the jo ab ashram se apane ghar janaa hi nahin chaahate the
 Rebellion ensues and demands are made that Ashram Chowk be declared an independent country
 vahaan fanse logon ke bich ek trephic jam kaa rashtrawaad panapata he
 a woman has a child in the car, a doctor who is trapped in the next car helps and naming that child in the next car
 afsos meri kahani puri nahin ho saki
 That story is now being completed every day in some or the other city
 dilli main kaanvadiyon ke kaaran jam kii samasya se kai logon ko pareshaan dekh rahaa hum
 How are these people who cannot stay in jam for three hours
 jis shiv kii prapti ke liye kaanvadiye kai dinon se kandhe par baari bharkam boj uthaae paidal chale ja rahe hai kya unke liye shahar trephic jam main nahin rah saktaa
 People affected by the jam have started calling Kawadi good and bad
 jaise kaanvadiyaa nahin hote hai tab gudgaanv mahrauli sadak par jam nahin lagata, ghazipur se ashram tak jam nahin lagata
 The jam is still used
 jam to baat baat par lag jaataa he
 Why is there jam in Mumbai vahaan to kaanvadiyaa nahin hai
 Traffic jams should not be excused
 use mauka chahie
 He gets anywhere as soon as he gets a chance
 stesan or hawaii adda hi nahin tamaam chauraahey uske priy jagahon main se hai
 People get caught in a jam after getting off the plane
 tab jaakar ahsaas hota he ki haa ve ab zamin par sarak rahe hai
 Somebody's car gets scratched and he stops arguing the owner of the scratching car
 baaki log apni apni car main chupchaap baithe rah jate hai
 The radio jockey gets lost in the melodious voices of Syama, Raunak and Richa
 ye log bhi mazaa lene lagate hai
 They give a gift on telling which area is jammed
 isliye mujhe acha lag rahaa he ki kaanvadiyon ne sadak ko apana bana liya he
 The Kanwadi have proved that whatever cars they fill on the roads, they will make space for themselves
 logon ko ghanton jam main fansaakar khud dance karte hue ja sakate hai
 If i had trouble with jam, i would have gone ahead as a Kanwariya but i have not
 itane vidwaan likh likhakar duniya se chale gaye ki paidal chalane waalon ke liye jagahen banaaiye lekin nahin bani
 Kanwarias come and go, making a place for pedestrians comfortably
 dikkat he ki un vidwaanon ne iaiti main shodh karte hue apana time barbaad kiya
 Instead, they would have taken water from Haridwar to Gurgaon and would have had a separate track for pedestrians in Delhi today
 main yahaan spasht kar dena chahta hum ki main pro-coundiya hum
 Sawan is the month of the common man's right on the streets of metros
 baaki saal apane adhikaron par itaraane vaale car vaale chupchaap rear-mirar main dekhte rahete hai ki koun naak khujala rahaa he yaa koun lipstic laga rahi he
 o haters of Kanwari, do you think of others when you and your relatives stop all traffic during the wedding season and do serpent dance on the roads? When you cannot leave the dance, why leave it behind? kya unki tarah aap apane armaanon ko puraa karne ke liye trephic jam nahin lagaate hai
 Bands do not arrange a market
 diwaali ke samay satarkta ayog ke lakh manaa karne ke baad jab asankhya kaaren gift lekar nikalati hai or un do dinon main bhayankar jam lagata he tab to aap ye nahin kehete ki thik he jaao aaj se gift band
 Jams from religious to political processions come under the account of democracy and religious freedom under the constitution, so we accept it
 lekin kya jam inhen chand kaarnon se lagate hai
 There are reasons for jamming
 sabko pataa he ki barish hogi to jam lagegaa phir bhi barish kaa intazaar karte hai
 When the haters don't hate the rain, then why do the Kanwarias isliye kaanvadiyon ko dosha na den
 All of us should be tolerant of traffic jams
 balki sahansheeltaa aa bhi gai he
 We all have gained experience of being stuck in jam for many hours
 trephic jam se sadakon par ek kism kaa samaajwaad aata he
 Cars ranging from three lakh to one crore look the same
 unki raftaar ek hoti he
 The condition of all the people sitting in those cars is also similar
 na to koi jaguaar se utar kar bhaag saktaa he or na olto car se
 Everyone reaches their destination together
 koi ye nahin kah saktaa he ki mere paas olto thi isliye der hui
 Nobody reaches out to beat anyone
 sab saath-saath pahunchate hai
 Traffic jams eliminate the difference between walking and walking by car
 donon ek hi raftaar se chalate hai
 Many times the pedestrian seems to win
 car vaala haarate hue gaanaa sunata he
 So I'm a pro-traffic jam
 mujhe trephic jam pasand hai
 Now i am feeling ecstatic by getting stuck in a jam
 maine ek jam-tourism kaa idia nikaala he
 i will have a website
 isamen google map se pataa chalate hi ki amuk jagah par jam laga he sainkadon logon ko alert massej jayega
 All these people will take their own car and get into that jam
 aap group main bhi website par registration kara sakate hai or akele bhi
 The comments dilli main jin-jin spot par niyamit jam lagata he, vahaan par sainkadon kaaren pahunch kar jam ko or jam kar dengi
 All the people will jam all night and all the cars will stop there
 kheer puri khaayenge yaa phir order dekar manga lenge
 Rather, a law should be made that in the metropolis it is mandatory for every person to stay in jam for three hours and in towns for at least one and a half hours
 trephic jam kaa ronaa rone kaa vakt chalaa gaya he
 Suggest a city where there is no traffic jam
 mumbai waalon se puuchhiye
 He has spent all his life in traffic jams
 dilli vaale bhi bitaa rahe hai
 You will leave this world but traffic jams are not going to go
 ham sab kaaren kharid kar jidipi to badha hi rahe hai or saath hi saath trephic jam bhi badha rahe hai
 What more can a person do for his country? puri dilli main chappe-chappe par car honi chahie
 There should be a car over the car and there should be a separate government for the car
 jo trephic jam kaa virodh kare use jail main daal diya jaae
 The car you buy should be jammed
 he ishwar har shahar ko teen teen ghante kaa trephic jam dena
 The child of the country learns to be stuck in a jam
 jam se mohabbat karnaa sikh le
 i have learned to love jam
 trephic jam ke prati meri mohabbat aaj kii nahin he
 In the year of 2008, i started writing a series of stories called Romance of Ashram Jam on my blog town
 rose shaam ko daftar se nikalataa tha or ashram jaakar funs jaataa tha
 The rush to go home slowly turned into patience for not reaching
 ghar jane kii bechaini samaapt hone lagi
 i felt that like me, the rest do not want to go home
 main ashram jam main fanse logon main apni kahani ke liye kirdaar gadhane laga
 These were people who no longer wanted to go home from the ashram
 baghaavat hoti he or maang kii jane lagati he ki ashram chowk ko ek azaad mulk ghoshit kar diya jaae
 The nationalism of a traffic jam between people trapped there thrives
 ek mahila ko car main hi baccha hota he jisaki agali car main fansaa koi doctor madad karata he or bagal kii car vaala us bachche kaa namakaran
 Sadly my story could not be completed
 wo kahani ab har din kisi na kisi shahar main puri ho rahi he
 i see many people troubled by the problem of jam due to kandis in Delhi
 ye kaise log hai jo teen ghanta jam main nahin rah sakate
 For the attainment of Shiva, Kavandis have been going on foot for a long time with heavy burden on their shoulders, can the city not remain in traffic jam for them? jam se trast logon ne kaanvadiyon ko bhala bura kahana shuru kar diya he
 As there are no Kanwadis, then there is no jam on Gurgaon Mehrauli road, there is no jam from Ghazipur to Ashram
 jam to tab bhi lagata he
 The jam starts with talk
 mumbai main kyon jam lagata he
 There are no Kanwadis there
 trephic jam ko bahaanaa nahin chahie
 He needs a chance
 mauka lagate hi wo kahin bhi lag jaataa he
 Not only the station and the airport, but all the intersections are among its favorite places
 hawaii jahaaz se utar kar log jam main funs jate hai
 It is then that he realizes that yes, he is now sliding on the ground
 kisi kii car main kharonch aati he or wo roak kar kharonchne vaali car ke maalik ko utaar bahes karne lagata he
 The rest are sitting quietly in their own cars
 radio jocky syma, raunak or richa kii madhur awaazon main kho jate hai
 These people also start having fun
 kis ilaake main jam laga he bataane par gift de dete hai
 So i feel good that the Kanwadi has made the road their own
 kaanvadiyon ne sabit kiya he ki sadakon par chaahe jitani bhi kaaren bhar do, wo chahenge to apane liye jagah bana lenge
 People can go dancing by hanging themselves in jam for hours
 mujhe jam se pareshaani hoti to main kaanvadiyaa ban kar hi aage aage nikal jaataa lekin mujhe nahin hai
 So many scholars have written and gone from the world to make places for the pedestrians but they have not been made
 kaanvadiyaa aate hai or aaraam se paidal waalon ke liye jagah bana kar chale jate hai
 The problem is that those scholars spent their time doing research at iits
 isaki jagah ve haridwar se jal lekar gudgaanv tak chal dete to aaj dilli main paidal chalane waalon ke liye alag se trek hota
 i want to make it clear here that i am pro-kavandiya
 mahanagaron kii sadakon par aam aadmi ke adhikaar kaa maheenaa hota he sawan
 For the rest of the year, car owners who have spent their rights silently keep looking in the rear-mirror to see who is scratching their nose or who is applying lipstick
 he kaanvadiyon se nafrat karne waalon, jab shaadiyon ke mausam main aap or aapke rishtedaar puraa trephic roak kar sadakon par nagin dance karte hai tab aap dusron ke bare main sochate hai? jab aap dance nahin chhod sakate to ye apana kanvad kyon chhod den
 Don't you make a traffic jam to fulfill your aspirations? band baaze kaa intazaam nahin karte hai
 After refusing lakhs of Vigilance Commission during Diwali, when innumerable cars come out with gifts and there is a terrible jam in those two days, then you do not say that it is okay to stop the gift from today
 dharmik se lekar raajnneetik juluus se lagane vaale jam loktantr or samvidhan ke tahat dharmik swatantraaa ke khate main aate hai isliye ham sweekaar kar hi lete hai
 But do the jams take place for these few reasons
 jam lagane ke apane kaaran hote hai
 Everyone knows that if it rains, it will jam, yet we wait for the rain
 jab barish se nafrat nahin to kaanvadiyon se kyon
 So do not blame the kanwadi
 ham sabhi ko trephic jam ke prati sahansheel hona chahie
 Rather, tolerance has also come
 ham sabko kai ghante jam main fanse hone kaa anubhav hasil ho chukaa he
 Traffic jams bring a kind of socialism to the roads
 teen lakh se lekar ek karod tak kii car ek jaisi lagati he
 They have the same speed
 un kaaron main baithe tamaam logon kii condishan bhi ek jaisi hoti he
 Neither one can get down from Jaguar nor flee from an Alto car
 sab apni manzil par ek saath pahunchate hai
 No one can say that i had alto so it was late
 koi kisi ko haraakar nahin pahunchataa he
 All arrive together
 trephic jam se paidal chalane or car se chalane main fark mit jaataa he
 Both run at the same speed
 balki kai baar paidal vaala jitate hue lagata he
 The carman listens as he loses
 isliye main pro-trephic jam hum
 i like traffic jams
 ab mujhe jam main funskar paramanand kii anubhuti hone lagi he
 i have come up with the idea of a jam-tourism
 meri ek website hogi
 As soon as it is known from the Google map that there is a jam at such a place, an alert message will be sent to hundreds of people
 ye saare log apni apni car lekar us jam main ja fasenge
 You can register on the website in the group as well and alone
 tippaniyan Hundreds of cars will arrive at the spots where regular jam occurs in Delhi and will block the jam
 saare log puri raat jam lagaayenge or sari kaaren vahiin rukii rahengi
 Kheer puri will be eaten or ordered and ordered
 balki kanoon bananaa chahie ki mahanagaron main har vyakti ko teen ghante or kasbon main kam se kam dedh ghante jam main rahanaa anivaary he
 Time to cry the traffic jam is gone
 koi aisa shahar bataa dijie jahaan trephic jam nahin he
 Ask the people of Mumbai
 unhone apni sari zindagi trephic jam main bitaai he
 Delhiites are also spending
 aap is duniya se chale jaaiyegaa magar trephic jam nahin jane vaala he
 We are all increasing GDP by purchasing cars and at the same time increasing traffic jams
 ek vyakti apane mulk ke liye isse zyaada or kya kar saktaa he
 There should be a car on a whim
 car ke upar car honi chahie or car ke liye alag se sarkaar honi chahie
 Those who oppose traffic jams should be put in jail
 jo car khariden use jam main daal diya jaae
 o God, give every city a three-hour traffic jam
 desh kaa baccha baccha jam main funsana sikh le
 Learn to love jam
 maine jam se pyaar karnaa sikh liya he
 i see many people troubled by the problem of jam due to kandis in Delhi

 o haters of Kanwari, do you think of others when you and your relatives stop all traffic during the wedding season and do serpent dance on the roads? When you cannot leave the dance, why leave it behind? kya unki tarah aap apane armaanon ko puraa karne ke liye trephic jam nahin lagaate hai
 Bands do not arrange a market
 diwaali ke samay satarkta ayog ke lakh manaa karne ke baad jab asankhya kaaren gift lekar nikalati hai or un do dinon main bhayankar jam lagata he tab to aap ye nahin kehete ki thik he jaao aaj se gift band
 Jams from religious to political processions come under the account of democracy and religious freedom under the constitution, so we accept it
 lekin kya jam inhen chand kaarnon se lagate hai
 There are reasons for jamming
 sabko pataa he ki barish hogi to jam lagegaa phir bhi barish kaa intazaar karte hai
 When the haters don't hate the rain, then why do the Kanwarias isliye kaanvadiyon ko dosha na den
 All of us should be tolerant of traffic jams

 We all have gained experience of being stuck in jam for many hours

 All the people will jam all night and all the cars will stop there
 kheer puri khaayenge yaa phir order dekar manga lenge
 Rather, a law should be made that in the metropolis it is mandatory for every person to stay in jam for three hours and in towns for at least one and a half hours

 The Kanwadi have proved that whatever cars they fill on the roads, they will make space for themselves
 logon ko ghanton jam main fansaakar khud dance karte hue ja sakate hai
 If i had trouble with jam, i would have gone ahead as a Kanwariya but i have not
 itane vidwaan likh likhakar duniya se chale gaye ki paidal chalane waalon ke liye jagahen banaaiye lekin nahin bani
 Kanwarias come and go, making a place for pedestrians comfortably
 dikkat he ki un vidwaanon ne iaiti main shodh karte hue apana time barbaad kiya
 Instead, they would have taken water from Haridwar to Gurgaon and would have had a separate track for pedestrians in Delhi today

 As soon as it is known from the Google map that there is a jam at such a place, an alert message will be sent to hundreds of people
 ye saare log apni apni car lekar us jam main ja fasenge
 You can register on the website in the group as well and alone
 tippaniyan Hundreds of cars will arrive at the spots where regular jam occurs in Delhi and will block the jam
 saare log puri raat jam lagaayenge or sari kaaren vahiin rukii rahengi
 Kheer puri will be eaten or ordered and ordered
 balki kanoon bananaa chahie ki mahanagaron main har vyakti ko teen ghante or kasbon main kam se kam dedh ghante jam main rahanaa anivaary he
 Time to cry the traffic jam is gone
 koi aisa shahar bataa dijie jahaan trephic jam nahin he
 Ask the people of Mumbai
 unhone apni sari zindagi trephic jam main bitaai he
 Delhiites are also spending
 aap is duniya se chale jaaiyegaa magar trephic jam nahin jane vaala he
 We are all increasing GDP by purchasing cars and at the same time increasing traffic jams
 ek vyakti apane mulk ke liye isse zyaada or kya kar saktaa he
 There should be a car on a whim
 car ke upar car honi chahie or car ke liye alag se sarkaar honi chahie
 Those who oppose traffic jams should be put in jail
 jo car khariden use jam main daal diya jaae

 sikkim main ravivaar ko aae bukamp ke kaaran 400 videshi paryatak abhi bhi rajya ke uttari kshetra main fanse hue hai
 The Center has formed an inter-ministerial team to visit the earthquake affected areas of Sikkim
 yah dal rashtriya aapadaa pratikriya kosh se bukamp se hue nuksaan kii bharpai or raahat kaaryon ke liye sahaayta dene sambandhi siforishein karegaa
 Meanwhile, sources said that Home Minister p Chidambaram will visit Sikkim on Thursday to take stock of the situation
 grih mantralay ke ek varisht adhikari ne yah jaankaree dete hue bataaya ki sikkim main is bukamp se hui tabaahi ke chalate ab tak 57 logon ke maare jane kii khabar mili hai jisamen sabase adhik 40 vyakti rajya ke uttari jile main maare gayi hai
 He said that 700 houses have collapsed in the state and 500 others have been badly damaged
 adhikari ke anusaar rajya main 66 kilowat kshamta ke 15 bijlighar hai jinamein se teen main bijli kii aapurti phir se shuru kar di gai he
 Except northern districts, power supply has become normal in other areas of the state
 adhikari ke anusaar rajya ke har jile main raahat shiviron kii sthapana kar di gayi he
 Of these, 2,700 have taken shelter in army camps and 550 in Indo Tibetan Border Police camps
 raahat or bachaav kaaryon main sena ke 5,500 jawan din raat kaam kar rahe hai
 Relief supplies and food packets have been dropped in various areas of the state through 30 flights of helicopters
 grih mantralay ke adhikari ne bataaya ki mobile toweron ko thik kiya ja rahaa he or doorsanchaar network kaaphi had tak saamaanya ho gaya he
 According to him, the state has ample reserves of food grains, petroleum products and LPG
 is bich bukamp prabhaviton ko fori raahat dene ke liye rajya main 1,000 kambal or 600 tent bheje gayi hai

 dilli main 15 saal tak lagaataar mukhyamantri raheen shila dikshit (sheila Dikshit) ke haathon main ek baar phir pradesh congress kii kaman saunpi gai he
 Part of the Congress' well-known strategy behind making Sheila Dixit the state president
 shila main ek saath kai khubiyaan hai, ve punjabi hai or purvaanchali bhi hai
 There are women and Brahmins with it
 itnaa hi nahin aaj bhi dilli main congress ke baaki netaaon main unki sweekaaryaktaa zyada dekhi ja sakati he
 This is the reason that despite being at the age of 80 years, Sheila Dixit has become necessary for the Congress in Delhi
 darasal 1998 se pehle tak dilli main bijepi kaa dabadabaa tha, jise bhedane ke liye congress ne pradesh adhyaksh kii kaman shila dikshit ko diya tha
 The stakes of the party high command came in handy
 congress kaa vanvaas khatm hua or shila dikshit mukhyamantri baniin
 His magic lasted for 15 years
 2013 main arvind kejariwal dilli waalon kaa dil jeetne main kaamyaab rahe
 Anna Hazare and Kejriwal launched agitation against the UPA government on corruption and the Nirbhaya case had added fuel to the fire
 iske alaava upie sarkaar ke khilaaf khadi hui satta virdohi lahar main shila sarkaar bhi funs gai or satta unke haath se phisal gai
 In such a situation, the Congress tried from Arvinder Lovely to Ajay Maken, but could not challenge Kejriwal
 ab ek baar phir party ne do dashak ke baad shila ko party kii kaman saunpi gai
 In Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal waived the electricity bill and water bill as soon as he sat on the chair
 lekin in donon ke jariye bahut lambii duuri nahin tay kii ja sakati
 Although Kejriwal has made a move in the field of education and health, the people of Delhi have to bear the brunt of the manner in which the Kejriwal government has been confronted with the central government
 ye baat kejariwal ke liye nuksaandeh sabit ho rahi
 Due to this, the people of Delhi did not like Kejriwal very much
 congress ke liye shila hi kyundilli main arvind kejariwal kii sarkaar hone ke baad aaj bhi log shila dikshit sarkaar ke dauraan vikaas ke liye jo kadam uthaae gaye hai, unhen yaad karte hai
 Sheela is considered to be instrumental in changing the picture of Delhi
 rajdhani kii trephic, palushan or culture ke liye jo log sochate hai, unhen shila ke kaarykaal main kiye kaam yaad hai
 CNG i
e
 Clean Energy was started in Delhi during Sheila's era
 metro kaa aagaman congress ke hi kaarykaal main hua tha
 He is believed to have contributed to the network of roads and flyovers in Delhi
 unhone kai saanskrithik aayojan shuru karaae the
 The greenery in Delhi is also done during the period of Sheela
 24 ghante bijli dilli ko pehali baar naseeb unke raaj main hi hui thi
 Sheila Dixit's hard work was also behind successfully organizing a big event like Commonwealth Game
 dilli main unhen pandrah saal tak safaltaapurvak sarkaar chalaane kaa shrey jaataa he
 Even during the BJP government at the center, Sheila Dixit ran the Delhi government with excellent coordination
 ye samanvay maujuuda kejariwal sarkaar main puri tarah nadaarad he
 During the first 6 years of Sheila Dixit's tenure, she also had good relations with the Center during the BJP government at the Center
 shila ke bare main kaha ja rahaa he ki pradesh kii 15 saal tak siem rahane ke saath-saath unki yah khubi bhi he ki vah sabhi ko saath lekar chal sakati hai
 It is also being argued that after being the CM for the last 15 years, she is deeply involved with grassroots activists
 is dauraan kai aarope lage, lekin sabit koi nahin hua
 In such a situation, this aspect was also in his favor
 dilli main jis tarah se aabaadi badi he, usase raajnneetik sameekaran badale hai
 There was a time when Punjabi was more, now people of Purvanchal and Bihar are fast settling in Delhi
 is lihaaj se shila feet maani ja rahi hai
 Sheela is closely associated with Punjab, UP and Delhi
 unhone dilli main padhai kii he, khandaani taur par unka punjab se naata rahaa he
 On the other hand, Unnao also belongs to the house of famous Congress leader of UP, Pandit Umashankar Dixit
 kannauj se shila saansad bhi rah chuki hai
 The Congress expects Sheila Dixit in Delhi
 aam aadmi party ne congress ke vot main sendhamari kar rakhi he
 Especially the Dalit vote is occupied by AAP
 muslim vot congress ke saath tabhi aayega, jab use lagegaa ki congress bijepi ko haraa sakati he
 The Vaishya and Punjabi votes are mostly with the BJP
 aise main shila dikshit ke saamne do chunauti he
 One is the challenge of correcting the social equation, bringing back the old vote
 umr ban rahi badhashila dikshit ke virodh main sabase badi baadha unki umr hi rahi he
 Sheela is currently 80 years old
 iske alaava unka swasthya bhi behatar nahin rahaa he
 During the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, the Congress made him the CM candidate of his party
 haalanki baad main espi ke saath gathbandhan hone ke baad unhone daavedaari waapas le lee thi, lekin tab bhi unka swasthya unke prachaar main baadhak banakar saamne aayaa tha

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special news letter congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kisaanon ke mudde par pradhanmantri narendra modi ko lagaataar gher rahe hai
 This makes BJP on the backfoot
 aise main bijepi saansad varun gandhi ne bhi apane bhai rahul gandhi ke sur main sur milaate hue kaha ki saal 1952 se lekar 2019 tak desh ke 100 udyogpatiyon ko jitna paisa diya gaya, us rakam kaa keval 17 fisad dhan hi centre or rajya sarkaron se kisaanon ko aarthik sahaayta raashi ke taur par ab tak mila he
 Nothing could be more embarrassing than this
 india dialog kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue varun gandhi ne desh ke kisaanon kii haalat par chintaa jataai
 Varun said that farmers in the country are not getting the benefit of most schemes
 desh main jab bhi kisaanon ko aarthik sahaayta dene kii baat aati he to haahaakaar much jaataa he
 Varun said that from the year 1952 to 2019, only 17 per cent of the amount given to 100 industrialists of the country was given by the Central and State Governments till now
 yani desh kii 70 fisad aabaadi ko beete 67 saalon main jitani aarthik madad rajya or centre sarkaron ne milakar di he, usase kai guna zyada paisa keval 100 dhani pariwaron ko de diya gaya
 Varun Gandhi said that why is the condition of the farmers of the country? To understand this, i tell that 56 percent of the total fruit production in the country rot in the initial 96 hours due to lack of good cold storage system
 akele uttar pradesh main har saal 2000 ton utpaadan hota he or yah beete 15 saal se ho rahaa he
 But the total cold storage in the state is 70 to 100 tons of storage capacity, which only big farmers are able to take advantage of
 varun gandhi ne kaha ki kya aap jaanate hai ki bharat kii mandiyon main kisaanon ke liye apane utpaada bechney kii khatir intazaar kaa ausat samay 1
 6 days
 jab use itnaa intjaar karnaa padataa he to wo kai baar majabuuran apana utpaada oune paune daam par bech detaa he
 Apart from this, he said that sharecropping has been illegal in the country since 1947, but 60 per cent of farmers in Bihar, 70% in Jharkhand, 50% in UP, 60% in MP cultivate the land of bantai and are called marginal farmers
 use bainkon se karj nahin miltaa or sthaneey mahajan se usko 40 fisad kii dar se karj lene kii majaburi hoti he
 So do not shed tears in the name of farmers, rather work for strategic improvement
 bataa den ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi lagaataar desh ke kisaanon kii karjamaafee ko lekar modi sarkaar par hamale karte rahe hai
 Rahul's allegation is that the Modi government waives industrialists 'debt, but does not forgive farmers' debt
 congress ne haal hi main hui vidhansabha chunaav main karjamaafee ko ek mudda banaaya tha
 He also benefited from this

 haalanki, kuch der baad hi sushant ne twit karke ye safai di ki unke handle par veryphid simbel 5 sitambar se hi missing he

 It is believed that he may announce some concessions in the budget, however, during this time he may have to work hard to keep the fiscal deficit within a limited range
 vitt mantri antarim bajet ke saath hi july 2014 tak ke kharchon kii ijaajat ke liye sansad main lekhanudaan bhi pesh karenge
 Traditionally, there is no change in direct taxes and no major policy announcements in the interim budget
 phir bhi isamen aam aadmi or madad kii darkaar rakhane vaale kuch kshetron ke liye riyaayaton kii ghoshnaa kii ja sakati he
 The Finance Minister has earlier indicated that he may change some of the rates of excise and service tax in the interim budget to give a boost to the economy, but he will not pursue major bills related to economic reforms in the absence of political consensus
 unhone kaha ki saal 2004 main tatkaaleen vitt mantri jaswant singh ne antarim bajet pesh karte hue 12 pej kaa bhaashan padhaa tha
 In 2009, Pranab Mukherjee, then Finance Minister, had read the 18-page speech
 isaliye mere paas chunane ke liye 12 se 18 ke bich do sankhya hai
 We can make any proposal except amendments to the law
 yah dekhnaa rochak hoga ki chidambaram super-rich kar ko 2014-15 main bhi jari rakhte hai yaa nahin
 However, the only indication is that he will not do this because the law will need to be amended for this
 vitt mantri ne pichley bajet main salanaa ek karod rupee yaa isse zyada kamai karne waalon par 10 fisadi iskar adhibhaar lagaaya diya tha
 There are 42,800 such people in the country

 During this time he can also tell how the government was able to control the current account deficit (CAD) and the fiscal deficit

 ek samay tha jab kaamyaab cinema ko do shreniyon main hi rakhaa jaataa tha
 Either blockbuster hit films or received critical acclaim, called 'art films' or 'parallel cinema'
 ab vaktbadal chukaa he or in do shreniyon ke bich kahin aane vaali filmon ko bhi saraahna mil rahi he
 Call them non-blockbusters as it is Rs 50 crore to make a blockbuster
 to lagate hi hai or unase 100 karod ru
 It is expected to earn
 kaamyaab non-blockbster ke saath aisa nahin he
 Although he has a great success at the box office, such as Paan Singh Tomar, Kahani, English Vinglish

 The actors give the characters their faces and make the story believable
 do raay nahin ki kahani ko sthapit karne ke liye nayak ke paas behtareen abhinay kaushal hona jaruri he
 In all such films, the script, story, direction, script and acting can be deeply felt
 aisi koi bhi film chaalu kahaniyon par nahin gadhi jaati, na hi yah kisi superstar ke bharose rahati hai
 The script rests on the shoulders of even a newcomer actor
 jaahir he bina maang ke aisi filmon kaa bananaa mumkin nahin
 The film industry is able to create a place for creativity in today's times only because the audience's understanding of films has become wider during the last few years
 uski ruchiyon kaa dayera badha he
 It is the result of this changing trend that actors like me suddenly come out and find the heart of people
 main rodies 2 kaa vijeta rahaa hum
 i have also been a radio jockey
 tivi sho bhi kiye hai
 But i always wanted to be an actor
 parforming art ke alaava mujhe na kuch samaj aata he, na hi main kuch or jaanata hum
 i did theater for five years and wrote plays
 lekin kamyaabi tabhi milti he jab aap taiyaar hon or saamne avasar bhi ho
 There is no dearth of opportunities in Mumbai
 industry kaa hissaa hone kaa yah sabase acha vakt he kyonki aaj bhartiya film udyog parivaarwaad se aage ja chukaa he or yahaan sabake liye jagah he
 During my studies in Chandigarh, i remember that my friends used to ask me what my back-up plan was
 main kahata tha, kuch bhi nahin, aaj main jo kuch kar rahaa hum uske alaava vastav main or kuch nahin kar saktaa tha
 What else is needed? main apane sapane ko ji rahaa hum, filmon main kaam kar rahaa hum or jin charitron main meraa bharosa he unhen nibhaane main mujhe fakhr mahasoos ho rahaa he
 i first read the script of Vicky Donor, then i understood that i am going to do this film
 thodaa-bahut andeshaa tha to apane abhinay ko lekar
 i was so obsessed with the script, that is why i wanted to act more than myself in every shot
 film itani sidhi-saral na thi, lekin hamaari kismat thi ki shujit sarkaar jaisaa nirdeshak hamen mila tha varanaa yah ajeebogareeb kism kii film banati
 It becomes a cheap story or a talker
 shujit kii sensibility kaa hi kamaal he ki film bilkul waisi hi bani, jaisi ki sochi gai thi
 After the film's release, when it became a success, which i call a successful non-blockbuster, i came across the same old questions from journalists and critics - did you know that the film will succeed or do you have Fear and fear? When did you realize that you had a great film? How was the first taste of success? Today it seems easier to deal with such questions, but when i look back and try to remember things, i only remember how i shot my shot again and again Wanted to retake while Shujit was so clear in his thinking that the entire film was completed within 40 days
 mujhe apane abhinay ko lekar ashanka rahati thi par shujit apana frem acchhee tarah samajhate the
 His confidence in me became my confidence
 mujhe lagata he ki aaj bollywood bahut acchhee haalat main he
 All kinds of films are being made and there is room for everyone
 yahaan dabang banati he, to english winglish ke liye bhi jagah he
 People's acceptance for experimental cinema has also increased

 In Love Shav Te Chikan Khurana, an actor does not go to where to get the khoyi recipe

 My next film Nautanki Saala with Rohan Sippy falls into this new category

 The Supreme Court dismissed the petition of the Shia Waqf Board on the Ayodhya case, the demand of the Board was that the Shia-made mosque cannot be given to any Sunni
 chif justise ranjan gogoi kii aguwai main paanch jajon kii sanvaidhanik peeth ne faisla sunaate hue shiya vakf board kii yachika ko khaarij kar diya he
 Before the verdict, Shia Waqf Board counsel Ashwini Upadhyay said that we were of the opinion that Mir was a rest of Shia and no Shia-made mosque could be given to a Sunni
 isliye is par hamaara adhikaar banataa he or ise hamen de diya jaae
 The Shia Waqf Board wanted to build a grand temple of imam-e-hind i
e
 Lord Rama, to set an example of hindu-muslim unity
 shiya vakf board kaa kya tha daawashia vakf board kii ore se board ke chairman syed wasim rizvi ne kaha tha ki saakshyon ke adhaar par babari masjid shiya vakf ke adheen he
 It is different that in the last 71 years, it has not been claimed by the Shia Waqf Board
 unhone kaha ki vakf masjid mir baaki (babari masjid) shiya vakf ke tahat aati he
 What else did Rizvi say? Thasia Waqf Board has been openly saying that the temple should be built at the disputed site
 wasim rizvi ne kaha ki vivaadit jagah par mandir or masjid donon kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he, to isse donon samudaay main sangharsh kii sambhaavna bani rahegi
 This should be avoided
 iske liye vivaadit jagah par ram mandir kaa nirmaan kiya jaae or vivaadit jagah se chodi dur muslim bahulya ilaake main masjid kaa nirmaan kiya jaae
 Rizvi said that the Shia board held the disputed land till 1946 and used to be Shia's Mutawalli, but the British government transferred this land to the Sunni Waqf Board

 Actually, many young men and girls had come to the Cosmic Bar to enjoy the first match of the IPL, but when the game was over in the field, the game of hookah and drunk started in the Cosmic Bar
 raat kareeb do baje jab mumbai police kii samaaj seva shakha ne cosmik baar main chapa maaraa tab sabhi hukka or sharaab ke nashe main chur the
 The police raided and detained 21 people, including two girls and 15 boys, but the owner and manager of the bar escaped
 jab tivi serial kii actress jiya maanik baahar nikaleen to media kii maujuudagi dekhakar bhadak gayi or aapa kho baithi
 Let us also tell you that the actress Zia Manik plays the character of a very decent, gentle and straightforward sister-in-law in the serial
 lekin real life main inaki kuch or hakeekat hi saamne ai
 However, according to the police, Jia Manik came here to eat only with some of his special people, so no action was taken against him

 wikileaks documents say that the CIA has used expresslane, a device designed by Cross Match Technologies

 The wikileaks article stated that UIDAI, as far as is known, could not investigate the background of these companies or their business, professional and private organizations
 yah daawa karata he ki siie agent realatime main aadhaar database kaa upyog kar sakate hai
 wikileaks tweeted if CIA spies had already stolen India's national ID card database? This was followed by another tweet, in which it was written that the CIA has already stolen India's Aadhaar database? Although official sources say that the report has not been leaked by wikileaks, rather it is a report by a website

 police ke mutabik, ek aaropee muslim tha vahiin baaki ke teen hindu
 In a press conference too, the police had named the accused as Arif, Naveen, Siva and Chennakeshavul

 One is Muslim and remaining 3 are Hindus
 It is a heinous crime and we are working hard to ensure capital punishment to all the accused
 Please don’t give religious colour to the crime

 However, the issue is not too big for the board
 lekin aap chaahe kitne bhi amir kyon na hon, lekin 160 karod rupee kii rakam koi choti-moti rakam to hoti nahin
 Now it has to be seen how the BCCI reacts to the icc's warning

 or inhen suljhaana bhi puri tarah se bisisiai ke haath main nahin he
 But the ICC works in its own way
 paitruk sanstha he or use bade pahaluon se sochna padataa he
 This is the reason that when the results did not come out in the last few times, now the ICC has come to warn
 baat yaheen tak nahin he
 The Cricket Administrative Committee constituted by the Supreme Court on this complex issue has ten days to respond to the ICC
 isisi ne chetavanee di he ki agar agar usne uskaa paisa nahin chukaaya, to vah vah rakam ko bisisiai ko vittiya varsh main milane vaale munaf main se kaat legi
 The thing is that the ICC has asked to compensate about Rs 160 crore recovered by the state and central governments of India in the T20 World Cup event held in 2016 in India
 jab bharat ne toornament kaa aayojan kiya tha to na to centre sarkaar se hi kar main chhot mili
 And not from the state government
 isisi pichley do saal se bisisiai se yah mudda sulajhane ko kah rahaa he, lekin aap samaj sakate hai ki uske haath main nahin he
 This is the reason why now ICC has given a warning to the BCCI, after losing tightly, that if it does not give Rs 160 crore, then its loss could fall on the Champions Trophy and World Cup event

 ) jharkhand (jharkhand) jab bihar se alag hua tha to pehle mukhyamantri bane the babulal marandi (babulal Marandi)
 At that time, he was considered the strongest leader of the Bhartiya Janata Party (jharkhand) of Jharkhand
 par 2006 main unhone gutbaji kaa aarope lagaakar party chhod di or tab se uke siyaasi kariyar par grahan laganaa shuru ho gaya he
 Babulal Marandi (babulal Marandi) has not been able to win any elections for the last ten years or after 2009
 marandi (babulal Marandi) lagaataar chaar chunaav haar chuke hai
 He won his last election in 2009
 tab ve koderma se saansad chune gayi the
 He had reached the Lok Sabha by winning the 2004 and 2006 by-elections from Koderma
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ve dumka chale gayi jahaan shibu sorain ne unhen haraa diya tha
 In the 2014 assembly elections, he had filed papers against Dhanwar and Giridih, but both of them had to face defeat
 2014 ke baad unki party ke chah vidhayak tuutakar bhaajapa (bhartiya Janata Party) main shaamil ho gaye the
 This shocked both his party and his image
 lagaataar chunaav haarane se bhi marandi (babulal Marandi) kii chhavi kamjor netaa ke taur par banati ja rahi he or dikhne laga he ki ab babulal marandi (babulal Marandi) vah netaa nahin rahe jo jharkhand (jharkhand) sthapana ke vakt the
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he tried his luck again from Koderma by defeating Annapurna Devi of BJP (bhartiya Janata Party)
 or is baar yani 2019 ke jharkhand vidhansabha chunaav (jharkhand Assembly Election) main bhi unke liye muqabla koi bahut aasaan nahin he
 The reputation of Babulal Marandi (babulal Marandi), president of Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JHVIMO) is at stake this time in the Rajdhanwar Assembly constituency of Giridih district of Jharkhand
 is seat par unhen teen majboot ummidavaaron se chunauti mil rahi he
 Looking at these challenges, the question is being asked whether Babulal Marandi will get an electoral victory this time? Voting is scheduled on December 12
 ab babulal marandi ke saamne apane raajnneetik kad ko barkaraar rakhane ke saath hi apni party jhavimo kaa astitv kaayam rakhane kii bhi chunauti he
 Due to this, the competition here remains interesting, on which the whole state is eyeing

 But Laxman Prasad Singh of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Independent Anoop Sonthalia and Nizamuddin Ansari of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are putting all their efforts in making this contest multicolored
 marandi ko is ilaake main 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav (jharkhand Assembly Election) main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 The BJP (bhartiya Janata Party) has once again nominated former police officer Laxman Prasad Singh who finished third in 2014, while JMM has nominated Nizamuddin Ansari as its candidate
 bhakpa (maale) kii ore se maujuuda vidhayak rajkumaar yadav ek baar phir chunavi maidan main hai
 In the last assembly election (jharkhand Assembly Election), Rajkumar defeated Marandi by more than 10 thousand votes
 asal main, rajdhanvaar aisi seat he, jis par jaateey sameekaran ko sadhana behad ahm he
 The voters of Yadav, Muslim and Bhumihar on this seat prove to be decisive here
 is chunaav main is kshetra main kul 14 pratyaashee hai
 But elections are counting Jhavimo, JMM, BJP, CPI (male) and Independent Anoop Santhalia among the prominent candidates
 kshetra main sabhi pramukh ummidavaaron kii pakad alag-alag kshetron main he
 According to the IANS, the talk of the CPI (male) candidate is more in this constituency than in the Gawwa area, while JVM in Tisri, Dhanwar Bazar and Dhanwar Rural are the most discussed BJP, JMM and Independent Anoop Santhalia
 jhavimo ke pratyaashee or purv mukhyamantri babulal marandi ieenes se kehete hai ki "is kshetra main vikaas kaary puri tarah thap he
 Even today people are struggling with basic problems like water, roads, electricity and health
 aise main janata sab dekh rahi he or chunaav main jawaab degi
 "but sitting MLA Rajkumar Yadav claims victory
 unka kahana he ki panchayaton or gaanvon main kisaanon ke liye talab banaae gaye hai or gaanvon main bijli pahunchaai gai he
