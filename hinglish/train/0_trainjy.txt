 According to Salil Mishra, "during the Second World War, Nehru was against the fascist forces, while Bose wanted India to support Germany and Japan in this fight and oppose imperialist Britain to pave the way for India's independence, which Nehru disagreed Were
 '‘us dauraan jahaan sardaar patel, rajendra prasad or si gopalaachari congress main rhite wing takatein thim to vahiin nehru or bose uske vampanth ke agrani

 As the last president of the Congress, Bose wanted to do different kinds of politics, he wanted his own program for which he neither had the support of Gandhiji nor Nehru
 yahaan tak ki acharya narendradev ne bhi tab kaha tha ki bose congress ko baantnaa chaahate hai
 After this development, Netaji wrote a letter to Nehru saying, "I am not sad that the socialists did not support me, but i am not sad that you did not support me
" ' subhash chandra bose hameshaa se anti calonial or nesanalist rahe par kabhi maas movement nahin kiya tha, unke deshprem par koi sawaal khadaa nahin kiya ja saktaa, thik usee tarah jaise nehru kii nishtha par

 One such girl told 'aaj Tak' what was the atmosphere like during the camp in the camp
 ladki ke mutabik, wo deraa ke satnamji college main pard chuki he
 This girl says that she had heard from people about the underground cave in the camp
 lekin aisi baton par kabhi vahaan charchaa nahin hoti thi, teachers se sirf padhai ko lekar baat hoti thi
 The way the media is now being shown about the cave and modern systems installed there, they are scared to know
 ladki ne bataaya ki jab bhi gurmeet ram rahim singh kaa college aana hota tha to suraksha kaa bada gheraa saath hota tha
 Only special people could go to him

 The decision has sparked controversy with the Cellular Operators Association of India, the apex body of the telecom industry
 association ne faisle ko 'niraashajanak' qaraar diya he
 Its director general Rajan Mathew said, "we are disappointed in the decision
" aage kii karrwai ham aupchaarik aadesh milane ke baad tay karenge
 "the industry believes that it is working as per the standards of the Government of India
" usne adaalat ke rajya vishesh yachika kii sunwaayee karne ke adhikaar ke virodh main daleel di ki cell tower centre sarkaar ke kshetradhikaar kaa vishay he
 But the High Court believed that education, sports, health and monuments are subjects of the state, so it has the right to intervene

 The beauty of Jaisalmer Fort is lost due to the random towers
 kai rihaishi colony, skulon or aspataalon par ye aas-paas laga die gaye hai
 The court has asked the government what steps it is taking to address the public's apprehension about mobile tower radiation
 use yah bhi bataane ke liye kaha gaya he ki abhi tak kitne skulon, aspataalon or saarvajanik sthalon se tower hataae gaye hai
 With the intervention of the High Court, the state government showed some readiness to prepare the report and set up committees, but no rules were imposed on the cell operators in this regard

 isliye hycourt ne kasliwaal maamle par bhi dhyaan dene kaa aadesh dete hue is sandarbh main uchit muaavja or sahi kaaran kii pahchaan karne ke liye uchit karrwai ke aadesh die hai
 Prateek Kasliwal recently told India Today that the Italian court has awarded compensation in favor of the person affected by the cell towers
 unka kahana he ki shahari vikaas evam awaas mantri shantilal dhariwal ke pados se fouran tower hataa diya gaya lekin aam logon kii chintaaen dur karne ke liye itani jaldbaaji nahin dikhaai ja rahi he
 He said that neither the use of cell phones, nor the risks associated with them and towers are being properly publicized
 israni ne india today ko bataaya ki ve is faisle se behad santusht hai or unhen us din kaa intjaar he jab cell toweron se aam aadmi ke jivan main padate khatarnaak prabhaav par dhyaan diya jayega
 Cellular operators are set to take their fight to the Supreme Court
 association ke pravaktaa ne kaha, ''hamen nagarikon or apane upabhoktaaon kaa khyaal he

 ham un maanakon par puri tarah se amal kar rahe hai or centre sarkaar ke saath kaam karte hue uchit niyamon or suraksha maanakon kaa paalan karne kaa vaada karte hai
 Whatever his plea, the High Court order has triggered a meaningful debate regarding the safety standards associated with cellphone towers, hopefully, the right rules will be implemented in this direction

 Your thinking will change a particular bank located in Haldwani, Uttarakhand
 is bank main bhi lenden hota he lekin paison kaa nahin khushiyon kaa
 Hence it has been named the bank of happiness
 haldwani sthit isbank kii shuruyatpraveen bhatta naam ke shaks ne kii
 In this bank, any common person can donate such items lying in his house, which is no longer of his use
 isamen kapade, juute, chappl, khilone samet har saamaan shaamil he
 On one hand, common people store the waste items lying in their house here, on the other hand they are used by needy people
 darasal yahaan aam logon dwaara jamaa kiye gaye saamaan ko garib tabake ke logon main baant diya jaataa he
 The needy people reach here and take the thing they need and use
 praveen ke mutabik unhone is bank kii shuruyaat tab hi kar di thi, jab vah padhai kar rahe the
 He told that he also works for the education of poor children
 praveen ke mutabik ab tak lagbhag 12 hajaar log is muhim kaa phayda uthaa chuke hai
 Common people are also helping them very much in this work
 aae din log apane ghar main pade gairajaruri saamaan ko yahaan chhod jate hai, taaki vah kisi ke kaam aa sake
 Praveen said that from here people do not take any kind of charge from their transporters
 isse na sirf log dene ke liye protsaahit hote hai, balki jaruratmand bhi bejhijak yahaan aate hai or bina kisi chintaa ke apni jarurat kaa saamaan le jate hai

 The recent crisis in Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank and other banks like it has worried many
 achaanak, bank jamaa kii suraksha ek mudda ban gaya he
 What will happen to their money if there is a breach in a bank? How do the regulation of banks work? The legal formalities are the same for all commercial banks (PSU banks, private banks, small finance banks and regional rural banks)
 ve jamakartaon se praapt puure paise ko udhaar ke rup main nahin de sakate; inamen se 4 pratishat ko nakad arakshit anupaat (siaraar) or 18

 It is used to protect depositors (it is currently 9 percent)
 sabhi vanijyik bainkon ko, niyamit rup se aantarik or bahari audit karana hota he jo lambey samay tak chalane vaali kisi bhi badi samasya se bachaav ke liye rakshak ke rup main kaary karte hai
 These mechanisms are meant to help banks deal with any adverse situation
 kya piesu bank nijee baikon se zyada surakshit hai?paramparaagat rup se, bharat main bainkon ne jamakartaon ke ucch str ke bharose kaa anand liya he
 However, the perception of security is generally higher for public sector banks ('public sector banks')
 sebi-pramanit vittiya salaahkaar form, capital koshient ke sah-sansthaapak or siio, saurav chakravarti kehete hai, ''ek saamaanya dharna he ki arabiai nijee bainkon ke mukaable piesu bainkon ko zyada suraksha detaa he
 In recent times, RBI has prepared a list of systematically important banks (sibs) which are very important for the Indian economy
 yadi aise bank vifal ho jate hai, to arabiai nistaaran vikalp pradaan karne or jamaadharakon kii suraksha karne ke liye kadam badhayega
 Many large private banks are now part of this list
 '' vartmaan main, saarvajanik kshetra kaa bank esbiai or nijee kshetra ke do bank, echdiefasi bank or isiisiaai bank, arabiai kii suchi main hai
 However, this does not mean that the central bank will not act to protect small banks
 chaahe yah ek nijee bank ho yaa saarvajanik kshetra kaa bank, koi bhi bhartiya sarkaar yaa arabiai aisi sthiti main nahin rahanaa chahega jahaan koi bank unki najaron ke saamne gadbaditaan karata jaae
 Whenever the central bank finds out any reason for a problem in a bank, it immediately takes corrective action to rectify it as it did in the case of Lakshmi Vilas Bank
 yadi sthiti main sudhaar nahin hota, to arabiai aamtaur par use kisi majboot bank ke saath vilay kii suvidha detaa he
 In recent times, RBI did the same when Global Trust Bank (a small private bank) saw it in crisis and merged it with Oriental Bank of Commerce, a PSU bank
 chakravarti kehete hai, ''aakhirkaar agar kisi aniyantrit chook ke kaaran banking patan kii ore badhata he, to nijee or saarvajanik kshetra, donon tarah ke bank nistaaran yojana ke tahat kendriya bank kii karrwai ke adheen honge
 Presently, whether it is a merger or acquisition, the risk is the same for the deposit holders
 '' beshak, satark rahane kii jarurat hoti he
 "the level of security among banks varies depending on their financial position," says Minna Aggarwal, financial educator, money mentor and founder of Finsphe
 ucchtar enpie or kam puunji paryaptata anupaat vaale bainkon se bachaa janaa chahie
 "with a co-operative bank, is your money safe? All commercial banks, be it public sector or private sector, are directly governed by RBI
" lekin jab sahakaari bainkon kii baat aati he, to unke paas dohare viniman hote hai
 Apart from RBI, they are also regulated by the respective registrars of central or various state cooperative societies under which they are registered
 paisabazardotcom ke siio or sah-sansthaapak naveen kukereja kehete hai, ''korporate gavarnence or vyavsaayikta kii kami sahakaari bainkon ke kamjor swasthya ke mukhya kaaran hai
 Dual regulation also gives way for urban cooperative banks (ucbs) like PMC Bank to avoid detection of irregularities
 sahakaari bainkon main peshewar board nahin hote kyonki unke nideshak mandal sidhe bank ke sadasyon dwaara chune jate hai
 Unlike commercial banks, cooperative banks do not require RBI approval while appointing a chief executive
 ''kukereja kehete hai, ''jahaan tak in bainkon ke viniman kaa sambandh he, arabiai saamaanya banking kaaryon ko niyantrit karata he jabaki sahakaari samitiyon ke register in bainkon ke prashasan or lekha pariksha ko viniyamit karte hai
 This double control leaves some flaws in the regulatory framework
 vitt mantri ne doharaaya he ki mantralay niamak khaamiyon ko dur karne ke liye niyamon main badlaav karegaa
 If this happens, we can see better regulation in cooperative banks
 jamaa ke liye beemaa cover sabake liesbase kharaab sthiti main, jab arabiai or tab kii sarkaar kisi bhi prastaav ko khojane main vifal rahati he or bank main halchal hoti he, to jamakartaon ke paas antim suraksha tantra ke rup main beemaa jamaa hota he
 Almost all banks have this facility under which depositors get insurance cover on deposits up to Rs 1 lakh which can include both principal and interest
 kukereja kehete hai, ''bank ke vifal ho jane par yah beemaa 1 lakh rupye tak kii bank jamaa raashi ko cover karata he, jisamen har jamakarta kii saavadhi, bachat, chaalu or aavarti jamaa shaamil hai
 There is no difference in the level of security of deposits in any type of bank covered and covered under the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC)
 diisijisi ek arabiai ke purna swaamitv vaali sahaayak company he jiskaa ekmaatr uddeshy jamaaon ko beemaa cover pradaan karnaa or credit suvidhaon kii guarantee dena he
 However, there are ways through which you can enjoy high deposit insurance cover
 aap apni jamaa raashi ko vibhajit kar sakate hai or ise vibhinn bainkon main rakh sakate hai; ek hi bank main apni jamaa raashi ko alag-alag khaaton main vibhajit karen, jise alag-alag adhikaar or kshamta main rakhaa gaya he
 For example, keep the account as an individual, or a joint account holder, partner of a firm, a director of a company, guardian of a minor, etc
, then all these accounts will be eligible for separate insurance cover of Rs 1 lakh
 
 cover badhayen1993 tak, jamaa beemaa cover niyamit rup se badhaayaa gaya tha
 But it has not been increased for the last 26 years
 kai logon ne chintaa vyakt kii he ki 1 lakh rupye kaa beemaa cover aparyaapt kaise tha
 "considering that only 28 percent of deposits are insured and the lowest cover of insurance in the world is in India," says Mr Agarwal
 is cover ko badhaane kii tatkaal aavashyaktaa he
 a recent SBI report recommends doubling the cover with a separate cover for senior citizens
 '' ummid he ki sarkaar mudrasphiti or chote jamakartaon ke liye ucch suraksha jaal kii aavashyaktaa ko dhyaan main rakhte hue cover ko badhayegi
 How do banks protect depositors' deposits? All public and private banks have to follow RBI standards equally
 sabhi vanijyik bainkon ko jamakartaon kii kul jamaa puunji ke 22
 An amount equal to 75 percent is to be reserved in the form of various reserves

 The Reserve Bank helps it merge with a strong bank if the banks do not improve
 jab bank ko ubaarane ke sabhi prayaas asafal rahete hai to ant main adhiktam 1 lakh rupye tak kii jamaa kaa beemaa jamakartaon ke liye antim suraksha kavach hota he
 Dual controls over cooperative banks cause many loopholes at the level of regulation

 haalanki jammu-kashmir vidhansabha chunaav par ayog kii yah baithak kisi nirnaayak nattejey par nahin pahunch saki

 uttarakhand kii tabaahi main kitne log maare gaye yaa kitne ab bhi gaayab hai
 Nobody is telling this claim
 kitni laashen kahaan padi hai yaa koun kahaan ab bhi jinda fansaa he is bare main bhi sahi-sahi baat koi nahin kar rahaa, par uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri vijay bahuguna ne ek aisa elaan kar diya he, jiske baad ek cheez saaf he or wo yah ki jo ab bhi jinda hai wo 15 july tak saamne aa jaaen
 Otherwise, no matter where they are, from July 16, they will be considered dead
 uttarakhand sarkaar ne elaan kiya he ki aasamaani kahar main gum hue log agar 30 din tak ghar nahin lautate to yah maan liya jayega ki wo sab ab is duniya main nahin hai or 30 din kii yah miyaad 15 july ko khatm ho jaaegi
 The Chief Minister has fixed the date of life and death by citing the rule, but what will be the picture after this date has passed? What will happen to the thousands of people who are just waiting every moment
 apano ke jinda or salaamat laut aane kaa, unki to ummiido kii bhi maut hone vaali he
 Thousands of people are still missing in Uttarakhand since the night sky-ravaged June 16-17 and there are different reports on the number of missing people

 According to the missing report recorded in different police stations of Uttarakhand, 7893 people are missing
 inamen 1227 bachche hai, jabaki sarkaar ke hisaab se 3068 log gaayab hai
 Thousands of people in every corner of the country are still waiting for their loved ones to return in Uttarakhand every moment
 chamatkaar kii ummid kar rahe hai
 Looking for them in the mountains and at the same time, instead of comforting the Chief Minister of a state, he says that now we will not wait any longer
 hamane taarikh tay kar di he
 No one will be considered alive after that date

 Mass funeral rites have also been performed several times in installments, but there are still hundreds of people, who died in front of their deaths but their bodies were not found
 maut kii taarikh tay karne vaale mukhyanmatri sahab kya murdon ke bare main bhi kuch kahenge? a Delhi court today granted bail to former Haryana minister Gopal Goyal Kanda
 adaalat ne uske dilli chhodane par roak laga di
 Kanda Airhostess Geetika Sharma is an accused in a suicide case
 atirikt satr nyaayadhish yashavanth kumaar ne kanda kii jamaanat yachika manjuur kar lee
 The court asked Kanda to pay a personal bond of Rs five lakh and two sureties of the same amount
 adaalat ne is bich kanda ko nirdesh diya ki vah bina uski anumati ke dilli nahin chode or unhen apana passport jamaa karne kaa bhi nirdesh diya gaya he
 Police opposed Kanda's bail plea during the hearing
 police ne kaha ki vah gavaahon ko prabhavit kar saktaa he or sabooton ke saath chhedchhad kar saktaa he
 However, the prosecution's argument was opposed by Kanda's lawyer
 unhone nyaayadhish se kaha tha ki agar use raahat di gai to vah adaalat ke aadesh kaa paalan karegaa
 Kanda had sought bail from the court on 17 February on the grounds that he had to take care of his ailing wife
 usne kaha tha ki vah pichley 18 maheene se nyaayik hiraasat main he or is maamle main jaanch bhi puri ho chuki he
 Kanda's lawyer had also told the court that the Delhi High Court had dropped sexual harassment charges against his client and that his bail pleas were earlier dismissed on the grounds that he had serious sexual harassment charges against him
 hindustani tiger ko chini dragon se khatra badhata ja rahaa he, kyonki tiger ke liye dragon kii bhukh badhati ja rahi he
 The growing demand for tiger body from China poses the biggest threat to the 1400 tiger population left in India, but China is not ready to stop the illegal trade of tigers despite all requests from India
 sajeesh main juta he chinaek taraf duniya is shandaar auki taqatvar jaanavar ko khatm hone se bachaane main juty he or duusari taraf dragon he jo lagaataar is sajeesh main juta he ki kaise duniya se baaghon kaa safaya ho jaae
 Chinese nobles are now drinking Tiger wine
 ve tiger kaa kebab bhi khaane lage hai
 They are decorating the tiger skins in their drawing room
 tiger kii haddiyon ko galaa kar wo mardaangi badhaane vaali dawaaen bana rahe hai
 Market demand for tigers is the demand for tigers in the Chinese market is constantly increasing and as the dragon is getting richer, the tigers of India continue to be threatened
 china main baaghon ke vyapaaree hindustan ke avaidh shikariyon se baaghon kaa jism munhmaangi keemat par kharid lete hai
 This is the reason why China has become the biggest enemy of India's tigers
 sabase khatarnaak baat ye he ki baaghon ke sangrakshan main juty duniya kii tamaam sansthaaon kii koshishon ke baavjood china baaghon ke avaidh vyapaar par roak lagane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Recently, Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh spoke to the Chinese Environment Minister about this, but the Chinese Minister's stance made it clear what his intention was
 bharat ne china se baaghon ke vyapaar ko rokane or sangrakshan ke naam par chalane vaale aise farm par roak lagane kii maang kii thi jo asal main baaghon ke jism kaa avaidh kaarobaar karte hai, lekin china ke paryaavaran mantri ne baaghon ke vyapaar ko shahatush ke avaidh vyapaar se jod diya
 China demanded that India first ban the mulberry skin trade
 china ne uthaaya shahatush kaa masalahalanki hakeekat ye he ki bharat ne pehle hi shahatush kii khaal ke vyapaar ko avaidh ghoshit kar rakhaa he, lekin tamaam koshishon ke baavjood china baaghon ke sangrakshan ko lekar sanjeeda nahin he
 Then the mulberry and tigers found in Tibet also cannot be compared because the tiger population is now left around 4 thousand in the whole world and the whole world has united to conserve this magnificent animal
 baagh bharat kaa rashtriya jaanavar bhi he, jabaki shahatush kii aabaadi sirf tibet me hi 75 hajaar se upar he
 By comparing the tiger to the mulberry, China apparently wants to abdicate its responsibility to stop the illegal trade in tigers
 duniyabar main baagh ko lekar chintajab puri duniya baaghon kii ghatati taadaad ko lekar chintit he, or is prajati ko bachaane ke liye tamaam koshishen kii ja rahi hai
 One of the reasons for the persecution of tigers in China is linked to Chinese astrology, and because of this, during the coming year, there is a great possibility of persecution and increase in tigers in China
 chini jyotish main jaanwaron kaa mahatvachin kii kundali main jyotish kaa puraa hisaab-kitaab jaanwaron ke naam se judaa he, jaise hamaare desh main mesh, vrish, mithun kark vagairah rashiyaan hai, usee tarah china main chuha, bail, baagh, khargosh or dragon jaise 12 jaanwaron ko raashiyon kaa pratik chinh mana jaataa he
 Every year in China it is named after some animal
 chini manyata ke mutabik jis jaanavar ke naam par saal hota he, us jaanavar kaa kisi naa kisi taur par istemaal karnaa shubh hota he
 So people use the organs of that animal
 koi apane ghar main chamadi rakhata he, koi daant yaa haddiyaan, to koi jaanavar kaa naakun hi apane paas rakh kar, sukh-samruddhi kii kaamana karata he
 2010 will be the tiger year old, ie 2009 is the year of mice in China
 chunki chuuhe aasaani se har jagah uplabdh hai or unki koi kami nahin he, naa hi unki prajati ke khatm ho jane kaa dar he, lekin bharat kii chintaa kaa vishay he aane vaala saal
 The year will be Tiger Year in China
 yani saal 2010 main china ke log apni kismat baagh se jodenge
 Throughout the year, people will feel lucky to keep tiger parts in their homes, offices, or in their pockets again
 itani badi aabaadi vaale mulk main agar har aadmi ko baagh ke angon ko saath rakhana chahega to zaahir he zyaada baaghon kii zarurat padegi
 More tigers will be killed and this will also have an impact on India, as the network of tiger hunters operating in India is connected to China
 bad sakati he china kii aakraamakatabaagh ke shikaar ko lekar to bharat kii chintaa he hi, chintaa is baat kii bhi he ki kya tiger year main china pehle se zyaada aakraamak ho jayega
 Actually, there is also a belief in China that the name of an animal that has a year, its nature also affects people
 chunki china main aane vaala saal baagh ke naam par hoga to to ye sawaal jaays he ki kahin china is saal baagh jaisaa hi hamalavar rukh to nahin apnayega?china kar rahaa dikhavachin dikhaane ke liye to yahi kahata he ki wo tiger farming karke baaghon kii ghatati taadaad ko badha rahaa he, lekin haqikat isse bilkul alag he
 Here tigers are bred so that they can be killed
 unke ek-ek ang kaa sauda kiya ja sake
 Tiger bones are used extensively in making indigenous medicines in China
 kaha jaataa he ki in tamaam kaamon ke liye china baagh kii farming karata he
 a network of poachers from countries like India also supplies tigers to China
 baaghon ko bachaane ke liye samjhautabaaghon kii prajati ko bachaane ke liye 1981 main ek antarrashtriya samjhauta hua tha
 After the pact, poachers were closely monitored all over the world, they were caught and the result was that there was a significant reduction in tiger hunting
 is samjhaute par china ne bhi dastakhat kiye the, lekin jab samjhaute kii sharton ko maanane main dikkat hui to agle hi saal yani 1982 main china ne is tarah hi tiger farming shuru kar di
 Sharad Yadav, former president of Janata Dal United (JDU), has stated his stand on the crisis hovering over his membership of the party and Rajya Sabha, saying that his fight is not to save the post but to save the principles and the constitution
 yadav ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki unhen rajya sabha se sadsyta khatm karne ko lekar notice mila he jiskaa vah makul jawaab denge
 Sharad Yadav said this on Tuesday by the Election Commission not taking cognizance of the Yadav faction's claim on the party and after receiving the Rajya Sabha notice
 yadav ne kaha ki in kanoonee pahaluon ko unke vakil dekh rahe hai, vah desh kii sajhi viraasat par aadhaarit samvidhan ko bachaane kii badi ladaai ke nikal pade hai
 On being asked to question the danger of going to the Rajya Sabha membership, he said, 'if we are fighting on a mountain, we are fighting only thinking that there will be an injury
 rajya sabha kii sadsyta bachaana bahut choti baat he, hamaari ladaai sajhi viraasat bachaane kii he
 For the principle, we have resigned from the membership of Parliament twice before
 yadav ne spasht kiya ki chunaav ayog main unhone nahin balki jadyu se nikaale gaye mahasachivon ne apana daawa pesh kiya he, isamen vah mahasachivon ke saath hai
 On the question of jdu's future, he said that JDU will come up in a big way after the meeting of the party executive on 17 September and the National Council on 8 October
 yadav ne apni bhavishya kii ranneeti ke bare main kaha ki vah siddhant or samvidhan ko bachaane kii raah par he or unke virdohi isaki ulat raah par hai
 He lashed out at JDU President Nitish Kumar, saying that even when our 'chief Minister Friend' had taken the initiative to form a grand alliance with RJD chief Lalu Prasad himself, he was not out of corruption charges
 jabaki mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar banane ke baad achaanak shuchita ke naam par gathjod tod diya
 Yadav said that this is a fraud with 11 crore voters of Bihar, we opposed it on the basis of principle
 yadav ne kaha ki ham siddhant or samvidhan ke saath khadey hai or sajhi viraasat ke manch se ise ladaa jayega
 After Doklam, China now tried to enter Ladakh as well, but Indian forces repelled Chinese troops
 iske baad donon senaaon ne is mudde par baatcheet kii or kaha ki aage se ye galati nahin doharaai jaaegi
 But despite this assurance that the Indian Army is ready to face China's tactics, India fears that China may continue to infiltrate many more parts
 sutron kii maane, to china kii najar ab himachal pradesh, sikkim, arunachal pradesh ke ilaakon main hai
 China may target Barahoti and Lipulekh areas
 yahi kaaran he ki sena ko in ilaakon main alert kar diya gaya he
 However, there has been talk of restraint from the army, and there is no talk of any provocation
 chini sena (piele) bhale hi kai jagah se ghuspaith kii koshish kare, lekin vah sikkim-bhutan-sikkim vaale ilaake main aisa karne se pehle dobaaraa sochega
 Because India's position is very strong at this place, which can increase its difficulties in Chumbi Valley near China
 lekin china ne jis tarah ladakh, arunachal pradesh or himachal / uttarakhand ke ilaake main ghuspaith kar saktaa he
 However, India also thinks that because a part of Tibet has its weapons, army and air defense, it will not go directly to war
 isaki vajah yah bhi he ki purvi ore se abhi doklam par morcha khulaa he or is hisse se dobaaraa morcha kholana mushkil hoga
 China is constantly trying to pressure India from Ladakh to Arunachal
 sutron kaa ye bhi maananaa he ki donon desh november-disambar se pehle doklam vivaad niptaana chaahate hai
 For this, India is also ready to withdraw its troops but China is not ready to withdraw its army
 bataa den kidoklam ko lekar huebharat or china ke bich vivaad ne donon deshon ke rishton main ek daraar-si bana di he
 After Doklam, there was news recently that the armies of the two countries were face to face in Ladakh
 haalanki, donon senaaon ne baithak kar vivaad ko baatcheet se sulajhane kii baat kahi
 But the Chinese media is constantly attacking India
 ab china ke tivi channel ne bharat kaa majaak udaaya he or doklam ke mudde par bharat ke 7 paapon ko ginvaaya he

 singh ne laal bahadur shastri parasnatak mahavidhyalay ke vigyaan parisar main swatchta par yojit ek sangoshtee ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki tajmahal bharat kii koi saanskrithik pahchaan nahin he
 There is only a grave in it, which neither connects the countrymen to any ideal nor gives us any achievement
 tippaniyan He said that some political parties are giving unnecessary reason to the removal of the name of Taj Mahal from the booklet containing tourism map issued by the Uttar Pradesh government recently
 unhen samajhnaa chahie ki tajmahal kisi ke pyaar kii nishaani ke sivaay or kuch nahin he
 The former BJP MP said that Babur, Akbar and Humayun were never ideals of India

 Irom Sharmila is often seen walking around Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences (JNIMS) Hospital, Imphal at around 7 am
 isi imaarat main pichley 16 saal se unki jindagi guzar rahi thi
 a thin nasal-gastric tube was tied to his nose which carried the nutrition needed to stay alive in his body
 par isi agast kii ek subah jab dur oonche pahaado ko badalon ne gher rakhaa tha, saiyr ke liye nikali irom sashastr gadrs se ghiri thim
 This was a different view
 rojaanaa tahalne ke dauraan logon ko irom se ekaadh baaten karne, haalchaal ke liye poochne or khabaren sunaane kaa mauka mil jaataa tha
 But on that day the guard told that the officers have strict orders that Irom should not be able to talk to anyone
 irom ko 9 agast ko adaalat main pesh hona he or ummid kii ja rahi he ki unhone jo kaha he, us par amal karte hue ve itihaas kii sabase lambii bhukh hadtaal khatm kar dengi
 The central government wants them to stick to this decision
 isliye un par bandookdhaari guard kii nigaraanee rakhi gai he
 His decision to stand as an independent candidate in the next year's Manipur assembly elections has caused a lot of confusion, surprise and even anger
 'eexspie radd karo' chhapi tii-shart pahane maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta onil kshetrimayum kehete hai ki irom ko kya karnaa chahie yaa nahin, yah bataane yaa unke nijee maamalon main hastkshep karne kaa haq kisi ko nahin he
 But he admits, "some of his supporters are disappointed that this is a sudden one-sided decision
" '' ve manipur main maanavadhikaron or gaiyr-sarkari sanghathanon ke bich kaam kar rahe mashhoor shaks hai jinhone sharmila ke saath judakar kaam kiya or unki puraskaar raashi se banaae gaye ek sanghathan ke trustee hai
 He has also helped in making a connection between Irom and his Goa native British lover Desmond Kutinho
 kshetrimayum kehete hai ki jab unhone sharmila ke anshan todgaye ke faisle ke bare main suna to sabase pehle unhen chaiyn mila, ''khushi hui ki ve apni jindagi main aage badaae ke liye taiyaar hai or aatmahatya sareekhe is mishan ko khatm kar rahi hai
 "but the feeling of relief surrounded the concerns that after 16 years of life without spending a single bite of food or a drop of water, how will she prepare herself today at the new turning point of life?" He is also concerned about his entry and future in local Manipuri politics
 16 saal pehle november main sharmila ne achaanak bhukh hadtaal shuru kar di thi or hafte bhar pehle use todane kaa faisla bhi kuch vaisaa hi he
 She has become an inspiration during this long time
 mashhoor maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta bablu loitogambam kehete hai ki sharmila kii logon ko hairat main daalane kii kshamta aaj bhi barkaraar he, ''saalon pehle jab vah mujhe yah bataane ai thi ki vah bhukh hadtaal par ja rahi he, to meri pehali pratikriya thi ki yah bahut mushkil he, tum nahin kar sakati
 "no one could have imagined that 28-year-old sober volunteer Irom would carry such a big resolve," says Loitogambam
 irom anya swayamsevakon ke saath maheenon se kaam kar rahi thim
 She would go from house to house collecting the facts related to gang rape, atrocities, beatings and murders and prepare their stories
 anshan par baithne kii unki bhoomika tab bani jab november, 2000 ko assam rifles kii ek tukdi par ek ugravadi gut ne bam se hamalaa kar diya or sainikon ne badale kii bhaavana ke tahat molom ke ek bas stand par khadey 10 logon ko goliyon se bhun diya
 Then Yambame Laba was on the State Human Rights Commission and a doctor from JNIMS told him that he could only keep Irom alive for one more day
 unke anshan ke chand din hi beete the or aatmahatya ke prayaas ke liye police ne unhen bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 309 ke tahat giraftaar kar rakhaa tha
 61-year-old Laba with a goat-like beard suggested to the doctor that Sharmila be given food through a nasal drip
 laba kehete hai, ''maine doctor se kaha ki agar sharmila aise hi mar gai to manipur jal uthegaa or main aatmadah karne vaala pehla aadmi hounga
 That man then understood the matter
 ''sashastr bal vishesh adhikaar adhinium (eexspie) 1958 main lagu hua tha
 In 1972, Manipur was conferred statehood and in 1980 it was declared a 'disturbed area'
 irom apni dridhtaa or dhairya kii vajah se manipur main eexspie ke khilaaf chal rahe andolan kaa cheharaa ban gai hai
 In 2004, about a dozen women in their 30s protested naked against the rape and murder of Thangjam Manorama in front of the gate of Kangla Fort, the headquarters of the Assam Rifles
 un mahilaon ke haath main ''bhartiya sena hamaara bhi balaatkaar karo' likhe binar the
 Many of the women who participated in that performance are now part of the Sharmila Kanba lupa
 yah joshilay samarthakon kaa aisa samooh he jo jeeniemas ke paas sadak kinare bani jhonpadipoon se apni gatividhiyaan chalaata he
 It is these women who attacked Irom's 'fiancé' Kutinho in December 2014
 unke kai samarthakon kaa maananaa he ki kutinho darasal sharmila ke akelepan or varshon kii kaid se upji bhaavnaatmak asthirataa kaa phayda uthaa rahe hai
 This dissatisfaction is on both sides
 kareeb do saal pehle irom ne apane bhai singhjit or anya samarthakon par aarope lagaaya ki ve taliban jaisaa bartaav karte hue 'honor kiling' kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 Singhjit, who lives in a simple house at a distance of some narrow lanes from JNIMS, is not ready to go past
 apni bahan ke anshan todgaye or rajaneta banane ke faisle par ve kehete hai, ''auron kii tarah main bhi hairat main hum
 i feel hurt and so is the condition of my mother
 '' irom ke adhiktar samarthakon kaa maananaa he ki unhone eexspie hataane ke liye kaaphi balidaan kiya he or ab ve peeche nahin hat saktin
 Renu Takhelambam believes the same
 renu apane pati kii maut ko hatya qaraar detii hai
 She believes that now other activists should come forward and fulfill their responsibilities
 ve iiviefeem kii adhyaksh hai
 It is an association of widows and families who cite instances of 1,528 incidents in an attempt to reassure the Supreme Court that innocent people have been 'murdered against justice' by soldiers under the guise of AFSPA
 vahiin loitongbalm kaa maananaa he ki irom se itar bhi eexspie ko hataane ke andolan ne jaden jamaa rakhi hai
 She believes that by coming into politics, she is putting her moral capital earned till now
 jahaan tak vidhansabha chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahe dalon kii baat he, irom kii tasviir vaale poster kaa khyaal hi unke sapanom ko pankh de rahaa he
 Armaments of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) are also starting to fester
 band pade ek hotel ke peeche toote-phute kamare se manipur main daftar chalaa rahi aap ko irom, unke rutabe or iske jariye aanan-fanan pahchaan kii darkaraar he
 They are more important to 'you' than 'you' is necessary for Irom
 vishleshkon ke mutabik irom kii siyaasi mahatvakanksha ke liye bijepi bhi ek behatar manch muhaiyaa kara sakati he
 But such speculation about Irom is wrong
 unhone anjaani disha main chalaang lagaai he, jaisaa unhone 16 saal pehle kiya tha
 This is a bold decision, perhaps audacious
 imphal free press ke sampadak pradeep phenzobam kehete hai ki sharmila ko shahadat kii suuli par chadha dena sahi nahin
 She does not want to be a saint
 unhen jindagi kii chaah he jahaan khub prem ho or raajnneeti kii chaisar bhi

 Whose monthly salary ranges from 60 thousand rupees to maximum one and a half lakh rupees

 RTI activist Hemant Gonia said that while migration from the mountain continues and the state is burdened with debt
 vahinmukhyamantri10 logon ko lakhon rupye selary ke rup main baant rahe hai
 This is lewd joke with the people of the state
 unhone kaha ki vah isaki shikaayat ek baar khud mukhyamantri se karenge
 Apart from this, the state leaders will also meet the opposition and inform them in this regard

 Tejashwi has asked that how did Bihar benefit from the government of Palitmar Double Engine made in Bihar due to the mandate theft? Apart from maladministration and unemployment, what was the share of the state? Why is the BJP shy of talking about the 2014 National Manifesto and the promises made in the 2015 Assembly elections in Bihar? They have said what happened to the special state and special package for Bihar? When the NDA government is at the center and in the state, then why is Bihar not being given its authority? Why is Bihar still at the lowest level of the national average on issues like law and order, education, health, employment, agriculture, industry, whereas in the state for the last 15 years, Bihar has been ruled by these jumlabars and retaliators
 tejasvi ne sawaal kiya he ki rojgaar ke masale main bihar abhi tak desh main sabase neeche kyon he jabaki tathakthith sushasan kii sarkaar lagbhag 15 saal se rajya main he? suniyojit aparaadh, hatya, balaatkaar, apharan ke aankadon ko dabl ingine kyon lag gaya he? bhrashtachar or balaatkaar main lipt sattadhari netaaon ko nitish kumaar kyon bachaa rahe hai? a head constable of Andhra Pradesh Police in Hyderabad, the Telangana capital, opened fire on a moving bus after arguing with co-passengers

 Similar is the condition of the semester system implemented in the universities of Madhya Pradesh
 bina puri taiyaari or shiksha dhaanche main moolbhoot badlaav ke iity kii tarj par lagu kii gai semester pranali chaatro ke bhavishya se khilwaad karne lagi he
 In this system, the education session was divided into two sessions of six months each, but the continuous internal assessment system i
e
 the backbone of the semester system could not be implemented in a manner due to the old mind set
 us par gajab yah ki ek vishay ke do yaa teen prashnptr kii puraani vyavastha ko khatm kar har vishay ke liye keval ek prashnptr kii vyavastha kar di gai
 Studying two or three papers together and settling it in a single leaflet has become outside the students' bus
 chaatro kii yah bebasii ab gusse main badalane lagi he
 Recently, a large number of students surrounded Vikram University in Ujjain
 darasal uniwarsity se sambhdgh collejon ke bikom first semester kaa haal main ghoshit rigelt bamushkil 40 fisadi rahaa he
 Students fear that the BSC first semester results in March may not be reduced to just 10 per cent
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki lambey prashnptr or baari-bharkam course kharaab rigelt kii vajah he
 However, in 2008 the University Grants Commission (UGC) had instructed the state government to implement the semester system so that a better environment for studies would be created
 ek government college ke professor kehete hai, ‘ucch shiksha vibhaag ke ekal prashnptr pranali lagu karne se chaatro par maansik dabaav bad gaya he
 This effect is visible on the result
 ’ haalanki pradesh ke ucch shiksha mantri lakshmikant sharma kii daleel he, ‘pariksha or moolyankan main lagane vaala samay bahut zyada tha
 To reduce this, it was decided to implement a single question paper system after discussing with students' associations, principals and university officials
 bhavishya main privet chaatro ke liye bhi semester pranali se parikshaayen lee jaaengi
 In fact, unlike the annual examination, in the semester system, the entire course is divided into two and the exam is done in six months
 jab yah pranali lagu kii gai to tark diya gaya ki isse chaatro par boj nahin padegaa or unamem seekhney kii pravriti badhegi
 Like the annual examination, the semester system also had two papers for each subject, while there were three papers for subjects like Chemistry and Mathematics
 lekin shiksha satr 2011-12 se lagu kii gai ekal prashnptr pranali main har vishay kaa ek-ek prashnptr hi rakhaa gaya he
 Vice Chancellor of Vikram University Prof
 tii
 R
 thapak iske samarthan main kehete hai, ‘pariksha zyada lambii na ho isliye yah pranali lagu kii gai
 If the examination will run for a year then when will the studies be done
 ’pehle chaatro ko teen aichhik vishyon ke do-do prashnptr or anivaary foundation course ke hindi, angreji or udhyamita vikaas kaa ek-ek prashnptr milakar saal main kul 9 prashnptr uteern karne hote the
 Now under the semester system, there are exams twice a year, that is, 18 question papers
 ab lagu ekal prashnptr pranali main har vishay kaa ek prashnptr hi rakhaa gaya he
 In this, two questions of the Foundation Course were placed in Hindi and Entrepreneurship Development First Semester and English and Entrepreneurship Development in Second Semester
 yani ab paanch prashnptr ek semester main uteern karne honge
 Says a professor, "the objective is to protect universities from the long test schedule and the increased work of copy checking
 bhale hi iske liye chaatro ko koi bhi keemat chukaani pade
 'student leader Mohammad Anwar says,' Earlier, to solve a question paper, five-six chapters had to be read, which has now increased to more than 10
 ’ ek professor kehete hai, ‘course ko ek prashnptr main sametane ke liye jo kaant-chhaant kii gai he uskaa nakaaratmak asar padaa he
 The Minister of Higher Education Sharma says, "in May, churn again and remove the deficiencies
 ’ aalochakon ke mutabik semester pranali iity jaise puri tarah se swytt sansthaanon main hi safal ho sakati he jahaan aantarik moolyankan mahatvapurn he
 Chancellor of Devi Ahilya University (DEAWI) Prof
 raajakmal is pranali kii kami bataate hue kehete hai, ‘semester pranali chaatro ke nirantar moolyankan ke liye he jisamen roj asinament die jate hai, lagaataar test hote hai jinke ank parinaam main jode jate hai
 But here the test system is destroyed
 kai jagah test liye bagaiyr hi uniwarsity ko ank bhej die jate hai
 The same happens in practical exams
 isse shiksha kaa str lagaataar gir rahaa he
 'dr
 Dravid was the vice-chancellor only
 ashutosh mishra kehete hai, ‘pradesh main semester pranali chah maah main pariksha karaane tak simit rah gai he
 It has deviated from its original objective of internal assessment
 ’ isiilie ek professor behad talkhi se kehete hai, ‘grajuation str par ucch shiksha vibhaag kaa puraa niyantran he, course vahi taiyaar kara rahaa he to pariksha kaa jimmaa vishvavidhyalayon ko kyon? moolyankan bhi vibhaag ko hi karana chahie, nahin to yah pranali dhwast ho jaaegi
 'this thing, Prof
 raajakmal duusare tareeke se kehete hai, ‘post grajuation str par uniwarsity ke study centres main yah safatapurvak chal rahaa he kyonki prashnptr vahiin taiyaar hote hai, moolyankan vahiin hota he or rigelt bhi vahiin taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Prof
 Dr
 in Government Kalidas Kanya College
 vandana gupta kahati hai, ‘disambar-janvari main semester pariksha, march-april main swadhyaayi chaatr ke liye vaarshik pariksha, june-july main phir se semester or sitambar main swadhyaayi chaatro kii poorak pariksha karaani hoti he
 In such a situation, when will you study and teach
 ’rajya shashan ne ekal prashnptr pranali ke liye kendriya adhyayan mandal se jo course taiyaar karaayaa he usamen bhi visangatiyaan hai
 For example, in the first of three mathematics papers, algebra and trigonometry were taught, in the second calculus and in the third, statics and dynamics were taught
 nae course se gatiki gaayab he, kalan or aanshik avkalan ko duusare semester main rakhaa gaya he
 On the other hand, in the first semester in chemistry, the first chapter is only about mathematical assumptions, which has partial differential and integral
 aise main first year ke first semester main chaatr ganit ke aavashyak adhyay padhe bagaiyr kaise rasayanashastra or bhautik-shaastra ke ve adhyay samaj sakenge jinamein ganit ke in adhyyon ko samajhane kii jarurat he
 The same is happening in commerce
 isamen lekhankan jaise vishyon main chaatro ko pareshaani aa rahi he
 Probably because in the recently announced results, a large number of students got zero marks in it

 Neither did Nagarjuna ever understand with a pen, nor did the female characters of his novels

 apane upanyaason main ve is sanstha kii apraasangikta ko siddh kar sah-jivan or stri-purush ke sah-astitv par jor dete hai

 shridharam ne usee samvedansheeltaa se use pathakon ke saamne rakhaa he
 Nagarjuna's eleven novels in Hindi and Maithili's two novels have been discussed for the first time in the context of women's freedom

 Its publication in the year of his birth is an achievement

 The celebration of a player's victory should be celebrated like a player
 us khel ke liye manaaya janaa chahie, na ki bharat kii saamaajik samasyaon ke nidaan ke liye kisi naare ke rup main
 We would love to celebrate PV Sindhu's victory in a similar way
 manaa bhi rahe hai
 Till yesterday, as much was not known about Balochistan, we also knew less about badminton, but PV Sindhu's game felt that we too would have been champions of this game but the school bus missed just before the competition
 was
 sindhu jab khel rahi thi tab uske chaude kandhe par ham sab savaar ho gaye
 He was also being shot shot by shot in fun filled with all the negatives
 japan bhi medal jeetne vaale mulkon main se he
 What difference does it make if you don't win in a few games? It felt like this when i saw a Japanese player playing in front of Sindhu
 uske kandhe par koi bhaar hi nahin tha, isliye vah sindhu ke shot ke saamne ladkadaa gai
 Sindhu stood by all of us
 sindhu ke jitate hi ham sab uske kandhe se utre or idhar-udhar bhaagane lage, naachne lage, gane lage
 It seemed that the dream of 'indus Nation' has been realized and now 'S' is being read as 'no'
 After the victory of PV Sindhu, the huge 'gaurav Sena' has come into the fray and fiercely started being glorified
 badhaaiyon kaa tantaa lagane laga
 We have such a swing as the sports facilities scattered in the village street have been behind the victory of Indus
 bharat main badminton ke hi khilaadi paae jate hai
 Sindhu lives by virtue of Pratap and blessings of PV Sindhu's ancestors and associates, who played from Gymkhana to Chitkhana Club to get rid of daytime office fatigue and belly bulge
 pichley hi bajet main bharat ko bandmiton pradhan desh ghoshit kiya ja chukaa he
 While writing essays in the examinations, the student goes on the front line that India is the country where the defense minister resigns if he does not make the sports minister! sindhu ko sajhi maanakar ham deepa kii kasam khate hai ki babitha kii haar kaa badla lenge lekin is vakt ham bharat ke log bahut khush hai or puspak vimaan se pulela gopichand par pushp varsha karnaa chaahate hai magar raat hone ke kaaran air trephic control ne anumati nahin di to ham log dharne par baithkar gopichand ko bharat ratna kii maang karne lagate hai
 Gopichand comes out and rejects our demand, calling us a shutup
 kaaran poochne par kehete hai ki mujhe coke kaa vigyaapan nahin karnaa he isliye mujhe bharat ratna nahin chahie
 Such a coach can be in a badminton country only
 lihaaja maang-wang chhodkar ham phir se aahu-aahu karne lagate hai
 PV Sindhu's victory is our victory
 aane do abaki sardi, parking main net tanakar practice shuru kar denge or parking ke liye kahin or atikaraman kar lenge

 indor-outdoor badminton kaa hi shor hoga
 
 
 Be patient 
 
 sab hoga
 The comments mere hamavatano, aapse ek guzarish he
 Dance like a winner on the victory of Sindhu and Sakshi, but on the pretext of this, slogan of government and social schemes was taken
 soshal media par koi isi bahaane beti bachaao, beti padhaao kii jai bol rahaa he, koi in khilaadiyon ko bahan ghoshit kar rakshabandhan par bahan kaa uphaar bataa rahaa he to koi ling anupaat ke aankade

 Jai Sindhu, Jai Sakshi, Jai Hind
 sindhu jab khel rahi thi tab uske chaude kandhe par ham sab savaar ho gaye
 He was also being shot shot by shot in fun filled with all the negatives
 japan bhi medal jeetne vaale mulkon main se he
 What difference does it make if you don't win in a few games? It felt like this when i saw a Japanese player playing in front of Sindhu
 uske kandhe par koi bhaar hi nahin tha, isliye vah sindhu ke shot ke saamne ladkadaa gai
 Sindhu stood by all of us
 sindhu ke jitate hi ham sab uske kandhe se utre or idhar-udhar bhaagane lage, naachne lage, gane lage
 It seemed that the dream of 'indus Nation' has been realized and now 'S' is being read as 'no'
 After the victory of PV Sindhu, the huge 'gaurav Sena' has come into the fray and fiercely started being glorified
 badhaaiyon kaa tantaa lagane laga
 We have such a swing as the sports facilities scattered in the village street have been behind the victory of Indus
 bharat main badminton ke hi khilaadi paae jate hai
 Sindhu lives by virtue of Pratap and blessings of PV Sindhu's ancestors and associates, who played from Gymkhana to Chitkhana Club to get rid of daytime office fatigue and belly bulge
 pichley hi bajet main bharat ko bandmiton pradhan desh ghoshit kiya ja chukaa he
 While writing essays in the examinations, the student goes on the front line that India is the country where the defense minister resigns if he does not make the sports minister! sindhu ko sajhi maanakar ham deepa kii kasam khate hai ki babitha kii haar kaa badla lenge lekin is vakt ham bharat ke log bahut khush hai or puspak vimaan se pulela gopichand par pushp varsha karnaa chaahate hai magar raat hone ke kaaran air trephic control ne anumati nahin di to ham log dharne par baithkar gopichand ko bharat ratna kii maang karne lagate hai
 Gopichand comes out and rejects our demand, calling us a shutup
 kaaran poochne par kehete hai ki mujhe coke kaa vigyaapan nahin karnaa he isliye mujhe bharat ratna nahin chahie
 Such a coach can be in a badminton country only
 lihaaja maang-wang chhodkar ham phir se aahu-aahu karne lagate hai
 PV Sindhu's victory is our victory
 aane do abaki sardi, parking main net tanakar practice shuru kar denge or parking ke liye kahin or atikaraman kar lenge
 Yes, electricity is surplus now, so instead of a 100 watt bulb, you will play with a flood light
 indor-outdoor badminton kaa hi shor hoga
 
 
 Be patient 
 
 sab hoga
 The comments mere hamavatano, aapse ek guzarish he
 Dance like a winner on the victory of Sindhu and Sakshi, but on the pretext of this, slogan of government and social schemes was taken
 soshal media par koi isi bahaane beti bachaao, beti padhaao kii jai bol rahaa he, koi in khilaadiyon ko bahan ghoshit kar rakshabandhan par bahan kaa uphaar bataa rahaa he to koi ling anupaat ke aankade

 Anurag Thakurki, President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), may add to the troubles
 bisisiai main sudhaar ke maamle par sunwaayee ke dauraan pradhan nyaayadhish tii
 s Thakur said that Anurag Thakur can be tried for contempt of court and he can also go to jail
 anuraag thakur ne kii parajuridarasal supreme court ne maamle par sunwaayee ke dauraan emicas curi (nyaay mitra) gopal subramanyam se poocha tha ki kyammbhchhchhiadhyaksh anuraag thakur ke khilaaf parajuri yani court main jhuthe saboot dene kaa maamla banataa he yaa nahin? is par subramanyam ne apane jawaab main kaha ki thakur par yah maamla banataa he
 Angered by this, Chief Justice Thakur took a tough stand and warned Anurag Thakur to run a contempt case and remove the high officials of the board including Thakur
 haalanki court ne is maamle main aadesh surakshit rakhaa he or ummid he ki 2 yaa 3 janvari ko faisla sunaaya ja saktaa he
 Accusing Thakur of obstructing the reform process, the fact is that when Shashank Manohar was the BCCI President, he had said that the cag's nominated officer in the BCCI would be considered an interference of the government and due to this the BCCI would lose the membership of the ICC
 baad main jab manohar isisi ke chairman bane to is sambandh main anuraag thakur ne unase ek patr likhakar sthiti spasht karne ko kaha tha, lekin maamla court main vichaaradhin hone kii baat kehete hue manohar ne aisa karne se manaa kar diya
 On this, Anurag came to the court and said that he did not ask for a letter to this effect
 is par emicas curi subramanyam ne kaha ki ye donon baaten alag-alag hai
 Thakur has hampered the reform process, so a case of alienation is made against him

 csos demanded resistance to social interests, demonstrations and enabled society
 2014 main jab bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke netritv vaala rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan satta main aayaa, to spasht ho gaya ki sarkaar ke paas civil socity ke kaaryon ko samajhane ke liye na to samay tha, na hi dhairya
 Bank accounts were frozen and income tax officials raided major human rights organizations, civil liberties movements, anti-nuclear groups, and all those organizations who dared to question the government's actions
 2014 se videshi yogadan viniman adhinium ke tahat kareeb 20,000 sanghathanon ke license radd kiye gaye hai
 Prominent human rights activists have been jailed based on unproven and baseless evidence

 Its purpose is to declare and weaken the civil society that monitors and raises abuse of power

 They are being denied socially organized and their rights to life and liberty

 Civil society is threatened and most such organizations seem reluctant to raise their voices
 bahut zyada kamjor tivi or print media se bhi nagarikon ko khatra he
 Apart from a few respectable exceptions, we can see the media almost completely silent
 yah civil socity kii takat he
 It should take the path of complete vigilance, contribute to the creation of such a referendum that the facts are correct and the courage to speak against the power
 jab yah maanav adhikaron ke ulanghan yaa shakti ke durupyog ko ujagar karata he, to es satark media ke saamne rajnatik shaktiyaan ghutane tech detii hai
 This can lead to the downfall of elected governments

 Whatever the reasons may have been, regardless of the ownership of large corporates or the fear shown by the government, the media has forgotten that it is responsible to the citizens
 vah sarkaar kii kathputli ban gaya he
 More importantly, the media has also scrapped the concept of creating an equal atmosphere for all political parties to create an atmosphere in a particular aspect
 yah matadaataaon ke vibhinn rajnatik dalon ke pratispardhi kaaryakramon main se kisi ek ko chunane ke adhikaron main katautee kaa prayaas karata he
 Media houses who refuse to obey government orders are subjected to defamation cases worth crores of rupees; The media was suffocated

 But they too have to deal with unexpected disruptions and threats from the corridors of power
 kuch saal pehle yah spasht ho gaya ki naagarik apni ladaai sansad main nahin balki supreme court main laduya pasand karte hai
 The court was heavily contributing to the deepening of social laws and to the deepening of civil liberties, with the intention of revamping its image that had been tarnished after a disastrous record of supporting the Emergency
 upie-ii ke antim varshon ke dauraan supreme court ne bhrashtachar ko ujagar karne, kendriya jaanch beuro kii swaittata banaae rakhane or paardarshee prakriyaaon kaa bachaav karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai

 The parliament is completely dominated by the BJP after the 2019 elections

 Gandhian leader Anna Hazare was scheduled to attend a rally of Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday, but Didi kept looking at him
 udhar, hajaare ke sahyogiyon ne safai dete hue kaha ki anna tabiyat nasaaj hone ke kaaran raily main shaamil nahin ho paae
 If we talk about Didi's rally, then the rally, which was called to start the ambition of the Trinamool Congress high command to reach the sky of Delhi, could not get much attention
 anna kii sahaayak sunita godara ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘annaji kii sehat hamaare liye sabase badi baat he

 If they are unwell, they should not come out in the heat of the sun
 or yadi unhone tay kar liya to unhone sahi hi kiya hoga
 Anna had to give message and Mamataji is giving message
 ’’ An important point here is that an Imam of Kolkata had threatened that he would withdraw his support for Mamata if Mamata Banerjee shared the stage with Hazare
 mamata banerjee ne congress or bhaajapa ke alaava apni chir pratidwandvi vampanthi partiyon ko bhi nishaanaa banaate hue kaha, ‘‘bhaajapa kahati he ki vah sheersh satta par aegi
