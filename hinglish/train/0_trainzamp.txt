 (input from agencies) (agenciyon se input) The Lok Sabha speaker held an all-party meeting just a day before the commencement of the Parliament session, soon after which it became clear that the Parliament would start with an uproar and the issue of President's rule in Uttarakhand
 uttarakhand kaa maamla philhal adaalat mendrasal, congress kaa saath dete hue argedy, ensipi, jediu,left ne spikar se kaha ki, sabase pehle uttarakhand main lage raashtrapati shashan par charchaa honi chahie
 Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said that, on the one hand after the Constitution and its creator Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary Mani and Arunanchal on the other side, democracy was killed in Uttarakhand, we want to stop all this work and discuss in the House
 baithak ke baad sarkaar kii taraf se sansadeey kaary rajya mantri rajeev pratap rudi ne saaf kaha ki, faisla to spikar karengi, lekin uttarakhand kaa maamla philhal adaalat main chal rahaa he,27 april ko sunwaayeehai, isliye philhal is masale par charchaa karana sahi nahin hoga
 After this statement of the government, the speaker also clearly said that, it is not possible to discuss the matter in the court
 bas phir kya tha
 
 takreeban tay ho gaya ki, loksabhaa main khub hangaamaa hoga or vipaksh kaam-kaaj thapp karne main jutegaa
 Due to assembly elections, no leader of TMC, AIADMK and DMK was present in the meeting
 haalanki, sarkaar kii nazar tiemasi, eemke or bijedy jaise dalon par he, jo maukey par uski naiya paar laga saken
 The rest of the opposition parties, including the Congress, raised the issue of drought, water scarcity, farmers' problems, inflation and Ganga cleanliness and demanded a discussion
 argedy saansad jepi yadav ne ek baar phir bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja ke mudde par charchaa kii vakaalat kii
 The issue of aud-even was also raised
 In this meeting, the issue of aud-even was also raised in Delhi, TRS MP Jitendra Kumar Reddy said that, most mps come from outside and they have only one car in Delhi, sticker problem will also be there
 , Because mps have to come to Parliament for all the meetings along with the Parliament during the Parliament session
 isliye saasandon kii steekar vaali car sead-evanase chhot milani chahie, jiskaa kai netaaon ne samarthan kiya, lekin bijedy empi bhartahari mehtab is prastaav kaa khulkar virodh kar diya
 However, the speaker later said that she would talk to the Transport Department of Parliament for an alternative arrangement, so that the number of ferry carts could be increased
 haalanki in tamaam muddon ko sunne ke baad sarkaar kaa kahana he ki, wo sabhi muddon par charchaa ke liye taiyaar he, lekin asal pench uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan par charchaa ko lekar funs gaya he, jahaan par sarkaar or vipaksh kaa bada tabaka donon alag-alag chor par khadey hai
 The government may have succeeded in getting the legislative work done in the Lok Sabha on the strength of the number force, but the real challenge before it is in the Rajya Sabha, where the opposition is overwhelming in strength
 vaise bhi sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main congress or vipakshi dalon ne sadan kaa kaam-kaaj kaaphi had tak rajyasabha main kareeb-kareeb thapp kar diya tha, lekin janata ke bich chhavi chintaa ke chalate bajet satr ke pehle bhaag main vipaksh ne kaaphi had tak sarkaar kaa sahyog kiya tha
 Meanwhile, the political stir in Arunachal and then Uttarakhand has given the main opposition party Congress an opportunity to attack again
 udhar, congress ko ehsaas he ki, use counter karne ke liye satta paksh ne pehle hi ishrat jahaan mudde par top kaa munh sonia or rahul kii taraf mode diya he
 That is why, in a hurry, Congress got Mallikarjun Kharge, Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Manu Singhvi to meet the media just a day before the session started, in which former minister Kapil Sibal reiterated that, whether Ishrat Jahan was a terrorist or not, the court will decide , But his encounter has come to the fore
 lekin sarkaar is mudde se dhyaan hataanaa chaahati he, chargeshit daakhil hone ke baavjood ab tak iskaa trial shuru nahin hua
 Congress demanded that the trial should start soon
 saath hi congress ne chargeshit ke tathyon kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki, is maamle main trial shuru hone par piem modi or amit shah ko bhi samman jayega, isiilie ab tak trial shuru nahin hua, aakhir sarkaar or sibiai ek hi hai
 At the same time, on behalf of the government, Rajiv Pratap Rudy replied that the Congress has been taking a liberal view on terrorists and terror
 aise main donon taraf se sansad main ek-duusare par baari padane ke liye siyaasi hathiyaaron ko dhar di ja chuki he
 Just waiting for the first day of the ruckus session which starts from Monday
 karnataka main paidaa hue siyaasi sankat ke bich ‘ajtak’ ne janata dal secular (jedies) or congress ke un do vidhayakon se baat kii he, jo rajya kii gathbandhan sarkaar kaa saath chhod or istipha dekar bengalooru se mumbai aa gaye
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, JDS MLA Narayan Gowda has said that he will not withdraw his resignation
 vahiin congress vidhayak pratap gauda patil ne kaha ki vah bhartiya janata party main shaamil ho rahe hai, or istipha dekar bijepi ke tikat par chunaav ladenge
 JDS MLA Narayan Gowda said that the Deve Gowda family harasses JDS mlas
 ajtak se baatcheet ke dauraan unhone congress par bada aarope lagaaya
 MLA Narayan Gowda said that the government is not doing such a good job
 haalanki iske liye akele mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami ko jimmedaar nahin tehra sakate, congress kii dakhsandaji bahut zyada he
 At the same time, he has spoken on the Congress not to allow CM Kumaraswamy to work
 congress MLA pratap gauda patil (photo-ians)vahiin, congress ke vidhayak pratap gauda patil ne ‘ajtak’ se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki hamane istipha de diya he or bijepi main shaamil ho rahe hai
 He said that soon after the resignation is accepted, we will join BJP
 unhone kaha ki ham bijepi ke tikat se upachunaav ladenge
 He will return to Bengaluru only after the resignation is accepted
 unhone kaha ki ab unki kisi bhi aashwaasan ke baad vaapasi nahin hogi
 Significantly, the jds-congress government of Karnataka has been under cloud for a long time
 shanivaar ko karnataka ke siyaasi sankat ne tab or vikaraal rup le liya jab congress-jedies ke kul 13 vidhayakon ne istipha diya
 These legislators submitted their resignations to their personal secretary in the absence of Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar

 The Supreme Court had asked the prosecution that there was evidence that Govindachami had thrown Soumya from the train

 narendra modi sarkaar kii duusari cabinet baithak guuruuvaar ko sampann hui
 Prime Minister Modi has clarified the 10 point priorities for the government to his cabinet
 jaaniye kya hai ye
 1
 naukarshahon kaa manobalah adhikariyon ko sarkaar kaa samarthan ho, taaki ve nitiyon ko jameen par amali jama pahana saken
 2
 nae sujhaavon kaa swaagatah chaahe adhikari ho yaa janata, sabhi ek bharat shreshth bharat banane ke liye apni raay de sakate hai
 Ministers seek public opinion on Facebook and Twitter
 adhikari apane plan kaa blueprint taiyaar kar pradhanmantri yaa apane mantri se sampark karen
 3
 shiksha, swasth, pani, sadakh agar basic jaruratein hi puri nahin hongi, viksit desh kaise banegaa
 Therefore, the government must first provide education, health facility to every village-locality-city, clean drinking water, water in fields and roads for smooth traffic
 4
 Transparency in government: Corruption is a matter of concern for the whole country
 or iske sudhaar kii shuruyaat upar se honi chahie
 Every policy, every action of the new government should be completely transparent
 5
 Arrangements for inter-ministerial coordination: The file of one ministry remains stuck in another ministry
 natijatan, vikaas kaary thapp ho jate hai or aarope shuru
 To overcome this, there will be a new system of coordination among all the ministries
 6
 System to fulfill the promise of the public: The mandate is given by making some promises to the public
 ye tay karnaa hoga ki jo vaayade kiye gaye hai, ve samaybaddh dhang se puure kiye jaaen
 For this, the policies and their results are being evaluated on the basis of the points of the manifesto
 7
 Trying to get the economy back on track: The country's expectations are high and they are increasing
 agar mahangaai kam nahin hogi, rojgaar ke saadhan nahin badhenge, jidipi kii sehat nahin sudharegi to yah sab niraashaa main badal jayega
 The economy has to be brought back on track by improving policy levels, making sound decisions and accelerating development
 8
 Reform for resources and investment: Investment needs to be encouraged to bring the economy back on track
 isaki raah main aae rode hataane honge
 Along with this, policies have to be reformed to prevent loot of resources but also for their proper use
 9
 Policies are formulated within the fixed time frame and then a heap of files is piled on them
 aavashyaktaa he ki har kaam kii ek miyaad tay ho or javabdehi nishchit kii jaae
 Emphasis on timely delivery of corporate accents
 10
 Stability and continuity in government policies: Be it foreign investors or bureaucracy, everyone is afraid that when the government changes or does not know when to take the government policy
 yah galat he
 Government policy should not only be clear, but it should be for long-term and continuity, so that the vision is clear to everyone

 The BJP had not yet recovered from the death of former External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on the evening of August 6 that former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has passed away on 24 August

 dilli main vaayu pradooshan jab charam par tha tab supreme court ne bhi gas chember kaa istamaal kiya tabhi khatka tha
 This may not be a reference to the Supreme Coat, but the gas chamber misses a chapter in history that makes anyone's soul tremble
 isliye shabdon ke istamaal main kabhi-kabhi saavdhaan rahanaa chahie
 It was the 1940s
 ek din main hazaron logon ko gas chember main daal kar maar diya jaataa tha
 You must have heard the name of Auschwitz in Poland
 tab germany kaa yahaan kabza tha
 There are pictures of the same
 yahaan par kai gas chember banaae gaye the jahaan par yahudee or raajnneetik kaidiyon ko, viklangon ko buudhe logon ko le jaaya jaataa tha, pehle kapade utaare jate the nahalaaya jaataa tha
 They were taken to a chamber, filled with gas in two minutes and hundreds of people died at once
 is tarah kaha jaataa he ki in gas chember main ek saal main 20 lakh logon ko maaraa ja saktaa tha
 Hitler is said to have killed six million Jews in Germany in different ways
 unke alaava duusare logon ko bhi maaraa gaya jinaki sankhya 1 karod se adhik bataai jaati he
 i do not know if you will take a selfie as soon as you go to the gas chamber or remember this reference to history that will never happen again

 The Intelligence Department had reported in front of the Joint Parliamentary Committee that 31,313 people of Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist and Parsi denominations in India are holding long term visas on the basis of religious persecution
 inhone naagarikta ke liye aavedan kiya he
 In this context, Home Minister Amit Shah's reply in the Lok Sabha is important
 unhone kaha he ki jin logon ko long turm visa milegaa unhen nagirakata di jaaegi
 So is this ruckus about 31000 people? In the Rajya Sabha, Amit Shah said that earlier it used to be that those whose passport visa expires were considered illegal migrants
 lekin ab 6 dharmon ke logon ko passport expire hoga to unhe avaidh pravasi nahin mana jayega
 Are they saying this on the basis of religious persecution or persecution, or giving a general amnesty to all on the basis of religion
 aap amit shah ke bayaan ko gaur se sunen
 They have started using illegal migrants instead of illegal infiltrators
 yani ghuspaithiye ab pravasi ho gaye
 This promotion is good
 yahi nahin aap sunenge ki amit shah assam ke sharnaarthi kaa zikr nahin karte hai balki bengal kaa karte hai
 At least at this place
 ho saktaa he ki unase chhot gaya ho lekin hangaamaa assam main ho rahaa he zikr bengal kaa ho rahaa he
 There is a lot of ruckus in Assam about the dates Amit Shah is citing
 assam ke pradarshnkaree avaidh pravasi ko abhi bhi avaidh ghuspaithiya hi pard rahe hai or dharm ke aadhaar par nahin baant rahe hai
 Under the agreement, all foreigners who came after March 1971 will be identified and removed
 ab yah taarikh badali ja rahi he
 The protesters say that BJP has always assured that the spirit of the Assam Accord will not be tampered with

 Amit Shah said that the language and literature of Assam will be concerned by the government
 kisi ko shankaa rakhane kii zarurat nahin he
 You heard that the Home Minister is asking whether to give citizenship to the Muslims of Pakistan, but in this speech, in the second place, he says twice that in 5 years, the Modi government has given citizenship to more than 566 Muslims
 unhone yah nahin bataaya ki 566 musalmaan kis desh ke the
 But in the Rajya Sabha itself, Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai said in written reply that 1595 Pakistani nationals have been granted citizenship of India during 2016 to 2018
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki afghanistan or pakistan se aae 927 sikhon or hinduon ko nagirakata di gai he
 When there is a provision for citizenship, can this question be asked, what was the need of this law? Ghulam Nabi Azad said that the Home Minister is saying that their number is in crores
 gulam nabi azaad ne kaha ki sirf 4000 sharnaarthiyon ne naagarikta ke liye aavedan kiya he to karodon kii sankhya kahaan se aa rahi he
 Kapil Sibal said that the people of BJP are referring to Manmohan Singh's statement that those who have been harassed from neighboring countries should be given citizenship, but BJP speakers do not mention Advani's reply in the same debate who said There were various types of allegations about persecution, we always say that those who have escaped religious persecution are refugees but those who are illegal refugees A
 They are illegal
 bahes ke dauraan har vaktaa apane hisaab se itihaas ke prasangon kaa zikr kar rahaa tha
 Creates curiosity about history, but do you have time to read the stories of the time of Partition, but the leaders play with facts in such a way that you must be left speechless
 is bill ko lekar bahes sunne ke dauraan ek baat samaj ai
 It has been read in many media reports that citizens of India entered into illegal countries in many countries and got citizenship there
 mujhe lagata he ki aise naan resident indian is bill se kaaphi khush honge jo america yaa kahin bhi avaidh visa par gaye or ab vahaan hotel vagairah chalaa rahe hai
 Doing a good job yahi duniya kii sachai he
 The search for employment can take anyone from anywhere to anywhere
 puri bahes main pakistan or bangladesh main hinduon ke utpeedan kii baat hoti rahi he
 But no one from the government could tell when they had talked to those countries about this question
 sarkaar hi nahin, congress ke netaaon ne bhi nahin bataaya ki unki sarkaar ke vakt hinduon ke utpeedan ko lekar pakistan or bangladesh se kya baat hui thi
 The statement of Bangladesh Foreign Minister Abdul Momin has been published in Dhaka Tribune
 bangladesh ke videsh mantri momin ne kaha ki unka desh bharat se is maamle main baat karne se pehle adhyayan karegaa
 Does not accept Amit Shah's statement about the status of Minority in Bangladesh
 hinduon kii yatnaa ke bare main jo kaha ja rahaa he ki wo anuchit he or galat bhi he
 There are very few countries in the world that have communal harmony like Bangladesh
 hamaare yahaan koi alpsankhyak nahin he
 All are equal
 agar amit shah bangladesh main kuch maheene rukate to hamaare desh ke sauhaard ko dekh pate
 They will have problems in their own country, let them fight among themselves
 hamen chintaa nahin he
 As a friendly country, we hope that India will not do anything that will make a difference to the relationship
 kapil sibbal or anya saansadon ne sawaal uthaaya jiskaa matlab yah tha ki neshnal register ke dauraan 19 lakh logon ne ligesi dastauez die hai
 That is to prove that they are citizens of India
 unhone nahin kaha he ki ve dharmik utpeedan kaa shikaar hokar bharat aae hai
 How to prove that religious persecution has come when not said before
 sibbal ke is sawaal par grahamantri amit shah ne jawaab diya he
 Sibal's question was how would one recognize that someone had been the victim of religious persecution, Amit Shah said, "our eyes are open
" is bill kaa jagah jagah virodh ho rahaa he
 The mps may not have been satisfied, but the mps who questioned, Amit Shah answered their questions by taking everyone's name
 usamen unka bhi naam le liya jinhone charchaa me bhaag nahin liya
 Sometimes it happens
 vibhaajan ke vakt ke itihaas kaa zikr hua
 It seemed that Nehru and Patel were presented before the Parliament and the Congress party was being asked not to ask the question of partition to them as if Nehru and Patel were not there at the time of partition, Congress Party was
 kehane kaa matlab he ki itihaas ko lekar jo daawey kiye gaye hai wo chintajanak hai
 After all, how will you calm your curiosity
 na vakt he na jaankaree ki kya padhanaa he
 Savarkar's statement was discussed Amit Shah said that i do not know whether he said it or not but i am not refuting
 to isi tarah zarurat hui to itihaas kaa istamaal kiya or zarurat hui to use hawa main chhod diya
 It is better to worry about history, away from the leaders, among the books at home
 varanaa raajnneeti laabh uthaati rahegi
 Home Minister Amit Shah said that all the people in the world should give citizenship to us
 koun se desh me aisa praavdhaan he
 The Champion countries of human rights are all over
 vahaan zaraa koi bharat ke naagarik ko naagarikta dilaa kar dekh le
 What can you give? ab yah sunakar lagegaa ki baat to sahi he lekin tathy yahi nahin he
 The fact is that there are many countries that give citizenship even after taking money, such as Mehul Choksi, who took citizenship on other grounds
 naagarikta sanshodhan bill par bahes ke dauraan amit shah ne kaha ki ve enarasi lekar aa rahe hai
 He himself has said that he will bring it
 apane apane dastauez taiyaar rakhie
 You can understand what will happen when the search for documents begins in the house
 mahilaon ke naam se to kuch hota nahin
 Where will she get the documents from? banjaare hai wo kya karenge
 Where will those who are homeless bring evidence? phir bhi taiyaari shuru kar dijie kyonki amit shah ne kaha he ki iske baad ve enarasi lekar aa rahe hai
 It is worth noting that Honeypreet, who is close to Gurmeet Ram Rahim, has been arrested by the police this week, which has been sent on 6 days remand by the court
 giraftaar hone ke ek din pehle haniprit ne safai di thi ki unke or ram rahim ke rishte ko lekar galat baaten bataai ja rahi hai
 Their relationship is like a daughter and a father
 gauratlab he ki dere kii do sadhviyon ke saath rape ke maamle main gurmeet ram rahim ko 20 saal sashram karawas kii sajaa sunai gai he or vah is samay rohtak kii jail main band hai
 On 25 August, he was declared guilty by the court, on that day his supporters created a fierce panic throughout Panchkula
 inako kaabo karne ke liye police ko goliyaan maari gai thim jisamen kai log maare gaye the
 Honeypreet was also accused of being behind this violence and the police registered a sedition case against her
 iske baad puure 38 din tak haniprit police ko nepal tak khaak chhanawati rahi or aakhikar usko punjab se pakad liya gaya

 As soon as the word 'euthanasia' comes to the fore, different kinds of fantasies start flying in the hearts of young men and women
 kishoravastha paar karte na karte, har man main isse jude khyal aane lagate hai
 There is nothing wrong in this thinking
 galatiyon kii shuruyaat tab hoti he, jab suhagaraat ke maukey par hi kuch log aisa kar guzarate hai, jisase unhen haseen lamhon main anand se vanchit hona pad jaataa he
 10 such mistakes have been discussed further, which can be avoided by mixing juice in honeymoon and further married life
 1
 Do not have sex without the consent of the partner
 In most cases people want to have a honeymoon , but it is not necessary that a sexual relationship should be done on the same night
 jab donon hi iske liye raji hon, tabhi vaisaa karen
 If neither of them is ready to have sex for any reason, then do not force them for this
 2
 Do not show haste in having sex
 Generally, young men and women do not know each other's body properly before euthanasia
 jab ve pehali baar khulaa jism dekhte hai, to sanyam khokar is kaam main hadabadi karne lagate hai
 Because of this, they are deprived of the happiness they need
 bina forple kiye koi bhi ladki yon krida ke liye jismani taur par taiyaar nahin hoti he
 3
 raktasrav kii ashanka se ghabaraaen nahinsuhagaraat chaahe kisi mahila ke liye sexual relation kaa pehla hi anubhav kyon na ho, raktasrav katai jaruri nahin he
 Normally Hymen (a type of membrane) is already destroyed during any other physical activity, so it is wrong to fear the possibility of bleeding
 4
 Do not doubt your spouse
 Many times people look at the honeymoon with suspicious eyes on their spouse
 isse un haseen lamhon kaa majaa to kirkira hota hi he, rishte kii buniyaad bhi kamjor pad jaati he
 It is better that both of them do not try to talk about each other's past, try to decorate the life that is in front
 5
 Do not guess sexual power by size It is sheer to think that sexual power can be detected by the size of a man's penis
 kamkrida kaa anand jodon ke khushnuma maansik nazariye or jindadilii par nirbhar he
 Size has negligible impact
 sexual power ling ke aakaar par nirbhar nahin karata he
 Do not put any such stress on euthanasia
 6
 Do not consume alcohol etc
 Some youths think that if they consume liquor etc
 on a honeymoon, they will be encouraged
 yah soch galat he
 The right mental attitude is enough for Josh
 sharaab kii gandh or bahake hue vyavhaar se jeevanasathi ko takalif uthaani pad sakati he
 7
 condom ke istemaal par baat kar lembehatar hoga ki donon baatcheet karke yah pehle hi tay kar len ki sex ke vakt condom kaa istemaal karnaa he nahin

 mangalvaar ko 12veen main vigyaan main bi group main padhe hajaaron chaatro ne gujarat main medical main pravesh ke liye rajya kii kaaman antrens test main hissaa liya
 Knowing that according to the decision of the Supreme Court, this examination has no meaning
 supreme court ne somvaar ko apane aadesh ke jariye ye spasht kar diya tha ki medical main pravesh ke liye sirf neet (NEET) hi maanya hoga
 Still on Tuesday, around 67,000 students took the state examination only on the hope that the state government may challenge the decision of the Supreme Court and give importance to this examination
 tippaniyan After all, the students of Gujarat board have little chance of success in NEET as there is about 30 percent difference in syllabus of Gujarat board
 bacchon ne pariksha to di lekin unke parivaar main ye gussa saaf jhalka ki unki samasya na rajya sarkaar ne sulajhaai na supreme court ke aadesh se hi sulajhi
 He feels that in two months it is difficult to read 30 percent of the new course
 unka kahana he ki iske chalate chaatro main maansik dabaav bad jaataa he, depressd lagane lage hai
 In other states of the country including Maharashtra, where such examinations have been conducted, there is similar confusion among the students of the State Board

 The children took the test, but this anger in their family became clear that their problem was not solved by the state government or by the order of the Supreme Court
 unhen lagata he ki do mahinon main hi 30 pratishat nayaa course padhanaa mushkil he
 He says that due to this the mental pressure increases in the students, they are feeling depressed

 ) As expected, this reshuffle in the Manmohan Cabinet became an immediate exercise
 spasht he ki congress ne manmohan singh ko koi bada badlaav karne kii chhot nahin di
 At a time when the party is badly mired in corruption and is constantly falling prey to judicial criticism, the Congress probably did not want to make any major reshuffle in the government
 is pherbadal main jo do sabase mahatvapurn badlaav hue hai wo hai kanoon mantralai tathaa paryaavaran mantralay ke sarvocch padon par badlaav
 It is clear that Manmohan Singh is in need of a law minister who can reduce the conflict with the judiciary on the telecom scam, the issue of black money, and the controversial Lokpal Bill and the Judicial Accountability Bill
 saath hi ek nae lau kamishan kaa gathan kar sake
 Former Law Minister Veerappa Moily could not live up to the expectations
 haalanki yah to bhavishya hi batayega ki nae kanoon mantri salmaan khurshid manmohan singh kii ummiido ko kis had tak puraa kar pate hai
 Former Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh also kept the Ministry of Environment always in the headlines or in controversies
 haalanki unhen tarakkee dekar paryaavaran mantralaay se hataaya gaya he or gramin vikaas mantralay kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya he
 It is expected that Ramesh will be able to do some good work in the Ministry of Rural Development
 manmohan singh ne haalanki aksham mantriyon ko cabinet se dur rakhane kii koshish kii he lekin ab bhi kuch aise mantri hai jo cabinet padon par bane hue hai
 For example, Trinamool Congress leader and Minister of State for Railways Mukul Rai disregarded the Prime Minister's directive to visit the railway accident site and should have been shown the way out
 lekin unhen keval rail mantralay se hataakar jahajrani mantralay main rajya mantri rahane diya gaya he
 The cabinet also includes some young faces with corporate links
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki ye kuch badlaav laaenge yaa phir apane sangrakshakon ke hiton ko hi aage badhaane kaa kaam karenge, ye to aane vaala samay hi batayega
 Overall there does not seem to be any major change from this reshuffle
 aisa lagata he ki pherbadal kaa uddeshy kuch mantriyon se kinaaraa karnaa or kaam naa karne vaale mantriyon se chhutkaaraa paanaa tha lekin dabaav kii vajah se aisa ho na sakaa jabaki kuch khaali jagahon ko bharaa ja saktaa tha or kuch or logon ko mauka diya ja saktaa tha

 congress kii sarkaar main jahaan nehru, gandhi ke naam se zyada yojanaayen shuru kii jaati hai
 At the same time, the BJP government has started big schemes to be launched in the general budget in the name of right-wing legends
 jin mahapurushon ke naam se bijepi ne yojanaayen shuru karne kaa faisla kiya he
 BJP sees the ideology of these people by connecting with their ideology
 bijepi ne jin mahapurushon ke naam se yojanaayen shuru kii hai

 Shyama Prasad Mukherjee - In the general budget, a plan has also been announced to start in the name of Shyam Prasad Mukherjee
 jawaharlal nehru kii sarkaar main udyog or aapurti mantri rahe shyama prasad mukherjee kii misaal ek kattar raashtra bhakt ke rup main di jaati he
 Thak Mukherjee joined Congress in Bengal Legislative Council
 1950 main bharat ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri nehru or pakistan ke pradhanmantri liekat ali khan ke bich dilli main ek samjhauta hua
 Accordingly it was agreed to make separate provisions for minorities
 pakistan ke prati nehru ke narm bartaav kaa virodh karte hue mukherjee ne cabinet se istipha diya
 On 20 October 1951, the Bharatiya Jan Sangh was founded
 rajdhani dilli ke ek sarkari aspataal ke medical afasar or teen karmchaariyon ne naukari kaa jhansa dekar do maah tak ek ladki ko apni havas kaa shikaar banaaya
 The victim alleges that she was accompanied several times by a doctor, two lab technicians and a gardener
 maamla dilli main NDMC ke charak hospital kaa he
 Sh Rmsar giving that has the police arrested deployed Afzal Khan and 50-year-old lab technician Kisnpal as a medical officer in the hospital
 jabaki ek technician surendar or ek mali abhi faraar hai
 Actually, in the month of March this year, the victim came to this hospital for a practical after doing a lab technician's course
 vahaan 6 maah rahakar use prectical karnaa tha
 His course was over in September
 ladki kaa aarope he ki oktober ke mahine main ek lab technician ne usenaukaridilane ke naam par aspataal kii lab main bulaayaa or vahaan uske saath balaatkaar kiya
 The matter did not end here
 aspataal ke ek or lab technician, ek doctor or ek mali nen bhi use apni havas kaa shikaar banaaya
 This story continued for two months ie October and November
 naukari dilaane ke naam par ladki se 25 hajaar rupye anth liye gaye
 Meanwhile, the girl broke up with her boyfriend

 After feeling cheated herself, the victim went to the Women's Commission and South Campus police station and registered a rape case against the four accused
 police ne shikaayat par karrwai karte hue aaropee doctor or technician ko hiraasat main le liya
 While the two accused are absconding
 aaropee doctor ne khud ko bekasoor bataate hue is maamle ko sharmnaak bataaya
 The contradiction within a political party keeps it alive
 jahaan virodh or antarvirodh samaapt ho jaataa he, vahaan raajnneeti kaa uddeshy samaapt ho jaataa he
 In this context, the meeting of the PDP and the BJP is a big success amid all the criticisms, because here both the parties were leaving their opposition
 aisa karte hue ve sirf samjhaute hi nahin kar rahe hai balki yah sambhaavna bhi paidaa kar rahe hai ki raajnneeti main do chor mil sakate hai
 There have been many such meetings between the two poles in the politics of India
 dalon ke str par bhi or netaaon ke str par bhi
 congress-non-congress friendship and friendship of socialists and bjpists against Congress
 raajnneeti main antarvirodhon ko sadhana bhi ek badi raajnneeti he
 At least on this pretext, PDP will look closely at BJP and BJP will look at PDP
 desh kii raajnneeti ke liye yah acha sanket he
 Another issue rained in the capital, Delhi, before this change was met with disputes demanding Afzal Guru's remains and thanking the terrorists
 raat bhar kii barish ke saath aam aadmi party ke bheetar itnaa kuch bhig gaya ki subah ke bayanon ne sukhi zamin kii tamaam sambhaavnaaon ko samaapt kar diya tha
 Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan are suddenly introduced as villains who want to remove Arvind Kejriwal from the post of party convenor
 aise aaropon kii chitthee dekhi or phir press main netaaon ke bayaan
 The hashtag of 'I Trust Kejriwal' and 'kejriwalcult' started trending on social media
 koi arvind par vivaad ko sulajhaa lene kaa bharose ko zaahir kar rahaa tha to koi yogendra par laanchhan laga rahaa tha
 Someone wrote without his name that while we were eating sticks in the Anna movement, some people were eating Rahul Gandhi's brokerage
 yogendra ke ghar khule laptop par hindi main likhe is twit par yah soch kar dhyaan chalaa gaya ki kahin meraa twit to yahaan nahin padhaa ja rahaa he! lekin twit pard kar yakeen sa ho gaya ki intervyuu main sab kuch seemaa ke bheetar hone kii yogendra kii vinamr ashaavadita par bharosa nahin karnaa chahie
 Yogendra, when asked repeatedly, said that Arvind is trusted
 vah bade netaa hai
 He has a role in history as less leaders have played
 main baar baar yogendra se puche ja rahaa tha ki aap aam aadmi party main hai yaa nahin
 Is the dialogue between you and Arvind ended
 yogendra har baar yahi kahe ja rahe the ki aap yah kyon puch rahe hai ki sari sambhaavna samaapt ho gai he
 Our party is not a weak party
 vahaan sawaal nahi uthenge to kahaan uthenge
 Still, that tweet written in Hindi was knocking
 anna andolan main kisne kya kiya ye hisaab hone laga he
 i know from my little experience
 jab doston ke bich hisaab kii yah naubat aa jaae tab dosti ko koi nahin bachaa saktaa he
 She expires
 holi ke pehle dosti kii yah adaavat dilachasp bhi lagi
 Figured what journalism shows
 jis yogendra yadav ke paas hamamen se kai raajnneeti ko samajhane jaaya karte the us yogendra se puch rahaa tha ki aapaki koi mahatvakanksha to nahin he
 i like this ruthlessness of the profession
 yahi imtahaan kaa vakt hota he
 In the same way, when Arvind and Aruna Rai gave a byte on the right to information in Sundarnagri around the year 2000, it seemed that what right is this
 ye log kis duniya kii baat kar rahe hai
 During the Delhi elections, he also asked Arvind whether there was a government or a shop
 arvind kaa bayaan tha ki main baniyaa hum bijness jaanata hum
 Just like fifteen years ago, i used to question my limited experiences on the right to information and returned with doubt, similarly i returned with surprise and doubt on the question of Swaraj within a party
 ye or baat he ki aaj usee soochna ke adhikaar ke liye kitne deshbhakton ne goli tak kha lee
 i was proved wrong after fifteen years and today there is a lot of checks on its scale
 kya pataa vaaki koi party apane bheetar swaraj ko lagu karegi
 But if you have claimed, then on this basis also the copy will be checked
 philhal yogendra bhi apane sawaalon ko lekar peeche nahin hatana chaahate
 It definitely said that we are not talking about any deadline
 hamaare saare sawaalon par aane vaale samay main dhire dhire gaur kiya ja saktaa he
 KC Tyagi and Tariq were watching the statements of Anwar on TV in the morning
 unke bayaan zyada sanyamit the
 a Shiv Sena leader refused to say what his internal affairs were
 yah un dalon ke netaaon kii pratikriya thi, jinke yahaan vivaad hote hi netaa ko do minute main nipta diya jaataa he
 No one is surprised
 nikalne vaala bhi do minute main apana gut banaakar apane purv netaa kii mazammat karne lagata he
 Everyone has seen this politics and has to go
 aam aadmi party main do dhruv ban gaye hai
 a lot of water has now flowed between Arvind and Yogendra
 anya patrakaron or party ke bheetar kai logon se baat kar laga ki vaapasi kaa rasta nahin bachaa he
 So many times i questioned Yogendra on the basis that it is being said that you will be expelled
 ek baar to vah dabdba gaye, lekin unke jawaab se aisa lag rahaa tha ki ve khud ko suna rahe hai
 Nobody is going to listen to them
 raste alag ho chuke hai
 Sometimes the answer that is given is actually like a question
 raajnneeti main sankat ho yah patrakaron ke liye sabase sukhad vakt hota he, lekin yah saare sawaal kuch aise hai
 On which people of other parties hardly speak
 chande ke sorce ke saath saath kharche kaa hisaab dijie, ummidavaar kaa boyedeta or detail website par daaliye, party main swaraj laaiye or rajya ikaayiyon ko swaraj ke model par faisla lene dijie
 Which party will take this uproar on its head? kya aam aadmi party khari utregi
 Expecting answers to this question at this time would be too much for this party
 philhal sawaal yahi he ki kya arvind kejariwal or yogendra yadav saath hai
 i do not think so
 magar asli jawaab to tab milegaa jab is masale par arvind bolenge
 a journalist must habitually doubt
 shaq se hi sawaalon ko rasta miltaa he
 The politics of Delhi is shocked
 jis dal ko 67 siton kaa aitihaasik samarthan diya us dal ke do netaa maheenaa bhar bhi saath nahin rah sake
 This too will be a history
 raajnneeti aise itihaaso ko jaldi hajam kar jaati he
 There is also a history that what he fought with Arvind became history
 lekin kya yah ladaai bhi bhula dene vaale itihaas kii ek or kitaab he yaa kuch or
 People will definitely ask the same old question, how do you differ from others
 kya isliye ki aasaani se alag ho jate hai

 Australian fast bowler Ryan Harris has written on the Cricket Australia website that if Pietersen gets a lot of runs while playing for Surrey, then surely the pressure to take him into the team will increase
 haris ke anusaar un logon ko is baat kii khushi he ki petersan jaise shandaar khilaadi kaa saamana nahin karnaa padegaa

 He said that there are very few cricketers who have aggression with confidence and such cricketers who have an average of 50 in Test cricket are happy to be in the opposition team
 inputah bhashaa The information sought under Right to Information (RTI) has revealed shocking
 janata ke paise par zyaadaatar saansad bijness or first class main udaan bharte hai
 The surprising thing is that in this case, the leaders of the left parties are at the forefront, whose expenses are the highest
 artiai se khulaasa hua ki loksabhaa ke sabhi sadasyon kaa ek saal kaa (april 2016 se march 2017) yatra or mahangaai bhatte ke rup main kul kharch 95 karod 70 lakh, 1 hajaar aath sau tees rupee rahaa
 Whereas, the total expenditure of all the members of Rajya Sabha for one year from April 2016 to March 2017 was 35 crore 89 lakh, 31 thousand eight hundred and sixty two
 saansadon ke liye kharch itnaa zyada isliye he ki zyaadaatar saansad first class yaa phir bijness class main udaan bharte hai
 Not only this, mps also have the right to get one-fourth of rent as dearness allowance

 Not only this, the CPI (M) MP has also got about 14 lakh rupees as dearness allowance
 dilachasp he ki sipiai (em) ne ritbrat banerjee ko aaleeshaan lifestil ke liye party se sanspend kar diya he
 The party took the decision in June this year after Ritabrata Banerjee put up a photo of Mont Blanc and Apple's smart watch on social media
 banerjee ko teen maheene ke liye party se baahar kiya gaya he
 The CPI (M) found him accused of violating the party's ideology, which encourages him to live a moderate life

 duusare kapade par 'baapu' kaa priy bhajan "vaishnav jan to tene kahie je, pir paraai jaane re
 
 
 "it is not a simple print on the cloth, it is a unique handicraft of the weavers of Benares, which is made from the fabric of their loom
 pradhanmantri narendra modi 18 sitambar ko apane sansadeey kshetra varanasi aa rahe hai, so, sarnath ke chhaahin gaanv nivasee bunakar bachchelal ne unhen dene ke liye yah angavastr hathkarghe par kellingraphy se taiyaar kiya he, jisamen rashtrapita mahatma gandhi kaa charkha chalaate chitra banaaya gaya he, or saath hi baapu ke priy bhajan bhi likhe gaye hai
 Weaver Bachlal has been working diligently on his handloom for several days to make this corset
 unki bunakari kii khaasiyat he ki kapade par apane haath ke jaadu se vah kuch bhi bana dete hai
 Earlier, he had made dupattas of Kabir's hymns, but since this time the Prime Minister has to offer Angastra, he has carved Gandhiji, his spinning wheel and his favorite bhajan
 aisa kyon, is sawaal par bachchelal kehete hai ki ham bunakaron kii dasha kisi se chhipi nahin
 
 
 We feel that if someone comes again with Gandhiji's thinking, then perhaps we can better understand the suffering of people like us and pay attention to us
 gauratlab he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi jab se varanasi ke saansad or pradhanmantri bane, tabhi se bunakaron ko ummid jag gai ki ab unke achche din aa jaaenge
 The Prime Minister also announced the gift of weavers to schemes such as Trade Facilitation Center, India Handloom Brand and 'ustad' on National Handloom Day, which has raised hope, but no confidence has been created as no plan is on the ground yet
 Has come, but the hopes of Banaras and weavers are still alive
 tippaniyan Dr
 Rajinikanth, chairman of the Human Welfare Association, says that the Prime Minister has gifted the weavers
 ab banaras kii samrudh parampara ke anusaar, ham yah prayaas kar rahe hai ki pradhanmantri ko tohfa diya jaae
 This affection of Kashi weavers for their MP is also not new
 
 
 isse pehle bhi bachchelal ne hathkargha diwas ke maukey par pradhanmantri ko kabir ke dohe kaa angavastr tohfe ke rup main bheja tha, lekin pradhanmantri ne jo vaade inke liye kiye the, ve ab tak inke paas nahin pahunche hai, so, is mar rahi kala ke liye is baar pradhanmantri inhen kaise bharosa dilaate hai, jisase inaki kala ke saath inke din bahurenge, yah dekhne vaali baat hogi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is coming to his parliamentary constituency Varanasi on September 18, so, weaver Bachilal, resident of Chhai village of Sarnath, has prepared this organ with a calligraphy on handloom, giving a portrait of the father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi
 And also Bapu's favorite hymns have also been written
 bunakar bachchelal is angavastr ko banane ke liye apane hathkarghe par kai dinon se talleenta se kaam kar rahe hai
 The specialty of his weaving is that he makes anything with the magic of his hand on cloth
 isse pehle unhone kabir ke bhajan ke dupattey banaae the, lekin chunki is baar pradhanmantri ko angavastr bhent karnaa he, lihaaja unhone gandhi ji, unka charkha or unka priy bhajan ukera he
 Why so, on this question, Bachlal says that the condition of weavers is not hidden from anyone
 
 
 hamen lagata he ki agar koi phir se gandhi ji kii soch ke saath aa jayega to shaayad ham jaise logon kii pidaa ko behatar samajhakar hamaari taraf dhyaan de saktaa he
 Significantly, ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi became the MP and Prime Minister of Varanasi, the weavers were awakened to hope that their good days would come
 pradhanmantri ne bhi bunakaron ko rashtriya hathkargha diwas par trade fecilitation centre, india handloom brands or 'ustad' jaisi yojanaon kaa tohfa dene kii ghoshnaa kii, jisase ek ummid to jaagi he, par vishwaas abhi nahin ban paaya, kyonki koi yojana abhi zamin par nahin ai he, lekin banaras or bunakaron kii ummiden ab bhi zindaa hai
 The comments human welfare association ke chairman dow rajnikant kehete hai ki pradhanmantri ne bunakaron ko tohfa diya he
 Now, according to the rich tradition of Banaras, we are trying to give a gift to the Prime Minister
 apane saansad ke liye kaashi ke bunakaron kaa yah sneh bhi koi nai baat nahin
 
 
 Even before this, Bachlal had sent the gift of Kabir's couplets as a gift to the Prime Minister on the occasion of Handloom Day, but the promises that the Prime Minister had made for them have not reached them yet, so, this dying art But this time how the Prime Minister assures them, so that their days will be spoiled with their art, it will be a matter to be seen

 Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti while addressing the police force program said that the local terrorists should not be killed in the encounter, they should be brought back home
 mukhyamantri mufti ne kaha ki afspa kanoon jisase sena ko vishesh takat milti he jisase ve shaq hone par kisi bhi ghar kii talaashi le sakate hai yaa phir unhen hiraasat main le sakate hai, hameshaa ke liye nahin he
 While addressing the people at the program of the police force, Mehbooba Mufti said, Kah, our children who have become terrorists, i appeal to the police to make an effort that they come back
 encounter main maar giraae jane kii bajaae unhen waapas mukhya dhara main joda jaae
 It would be better if they hold bat and ball instead of gun in their hands
 mufti ne jor dekar kaha ki yah behad jaruri he, jammu-kashmir main shanti or sadbhaav kaa vaataavaran banaaya jaae
 Talking about the violence, Mufti said, i want to ban the pelage gun, but for this the government needs the support of you people
 hameshaa se hamaare bacchon kaa kavach ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 We cannot ask anyone to throw stones at them and talk
 agar hamen baatcheet kerani he to hamen militancy rokani hogi
 The Mufti's statement came on social media when a video of Hizbul Mujahideen's terrorists was shot in a garden where they are hugging and congratulating each other
 yah ek muthbhed main maare gaye aatanki burhan vaani kii yaad dilaataa he
 The comments vaani soshal media kaa kaaphi prayog kiya karata tha jisase yuvaaon ko apane saath milaayaa ja sakate

 Chief Minister Mufti said that the AFSPA Act which gives special powers to the army by which they can search any house or suspect if it is suspected, is not forever
 police bal ke kaarykram main logon ko sambodhit karte hue mahabuuba mufti ne kaah, hamaare bachche jo aatankwaadi ban gaye hai, main police se apil karti hum ki aisi koshish kii jaae ki ve waapas aaen

 unke haathon main bandook ke bajaae bat or ball thamaya jaae to behatar hoga
 The Mufti stressed that it is very important, to create an atmosphere of peace and harmony in Jammu and Kashmir
 hinsa par baat karte hue mufti ne kaha, main pallage gan ko bain karnaa chaahati hum, lekin iske liye sarkaar ko aap logon kaa samarthan chahie
 Our children have always been used as armor
 ham kisi ko unpar pathar phenkakar baatcheet karne ke liye nahin kah sakate
 If we have to negotiate, we have to stop militancy

 The Kejriwal government has filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court on the circular issued on defamation cases
 IPC kii dhara 499, 599 par daakhil halafname main kaha gaya he - If the Supreme Court feels that this circular is wrong, then the government is ready to withdraw it
 circular jari karne kaa makasad kanoon ke durupyog ke liye nahin balki uski suraksha ke liye he
 Earlier there was no procedure for the use of this law, but the Delhi government has made three active plans for it
 agar kisi mantri yaa afasar ko lagata he ki uski manahani hui he to wo cese ko principal seketry home ko bhejega
 After investigation, the case will be referred to the Director of Prosecution
 yahaan se chaanbin ke baad ise kanoon mantralay bheja jayega
 Only then a case can be registered under this law
 agar court ko lagata he ki ye thik nahin he to sarkaar ise waapas lene ko taiyaar he
 The circular was issued by the Delhi government on 6 May
 media main khabar aane par darj kiya ja saktaa he manahani kaa maamla
 It is noteworthy that Arvind Kejriwal himself challenged this law in the Supreme Court
 kejariwal ke khilaaf chaar maamalon par supreme court ne roak lagaai thi
 On May 14, the Supreme Court sought a reply from the Delhi government by prohibiting the circular
 isse pehle subramanyam swami or rahul gandhi bhi is kanoon ko chunauti de chuke hai
 Kejriwal had to go to jail for not filling the bail bond in the Nitin Gadkari defamation case

 At the press conference after the match, a journalist was quoted by former Australian batsman Matthew Hayden as saying that the run-rate of the Indian batsmen falls near the century

 andhra pradesh ke sikanderabad main somvaar kii subah ek hotel kii do manjila imaarat ke dhah jane se kam se kam 11 logon kii maut ho gai, jabaki kai anya ghayal ho gaye
 City Light Hotel building on President Road 6 in the morning

 Police, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials, fire brigade and CISF personnel are engaged in relief and rescue work to clear the debris and take out the stranded people
 hyderabad police pramukh ne ghatnasthal kaa daura karne ke baad bataaya ki ghayalon ko nikatavarti aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 He said that some more people are feared trapped in debris at the hotel kitchen area
 ghatnasthal par maujuud jiechaemasi ke ayukta em tii krishna babu ne bataaya ki is ilaake main kai puraani imaaraten hai or unke maalikon ko is sambandh main notice jari kiye gaye the
 He said that it is being ascertained whether the building which was victim of the accident was also included in this list or not
 embibies college main admician lenaa ab aasaan ho gaya he, jahaan pehle ummidavaaron ko admician ke liye 50 fisadi ank hasil karne hote the, vahiin ab ummidavaar 20 fisadi ank hasil karke bhi daakhila le sakate hai
 For the last two years, candidates who have scored 5% in Physics, less than 10% in Chemistry and 20% in Biology in National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) are also getting admission in Medical College
 aapako bhale hi yah jaanakar aashcharya ho rahaa ho, lekin yah neet pariksha main percentaile kii vajah se sambhav hua he
 Actually, candidates are not selected on the basis of merit through NEET examination and candidates who achieve a certain percentage are eligible to take admission
 bataa den ki saal 2016 main neet ko embibies admician ke liye anivaary kar diya gaya tha
 SC: Aadhaar is not necessary for 'NEET' examination
 Admission is required according to a report of 18 per cent of the Times of India
 Earlier, the cut-off of admission used to go up to 50 per cent (general category) and 40 per cent (reserved category) and based on that Admission used to happen, but now candidates who score 18-20% in NEET are also able to take admission
 jaane kya he percentaile?bataa den ki percentailas persentage se alag hota he or yah ankon par nahin balki anupaat par aadhaarit hota he
 50 percentile does not mean that you have got 50 percent marks, because it is decided by the ratio
 yahaan 50 percentaile kaa matlab hua neeche se sabase kam ank paane vaale aadhe bacchon ke alaava baaki parikshaarthi
 Explain that percentile is decided on the basis of marks and rank and on the basis of marks in NEET
 apni percentaile jaanane ke liye ummidavaar ko apane number main topper ke ank kaa bhaag dena hoga or use 100 se guna karnaa hoga
 The result that will come will be your percentage
 kaise hua sambhavadrasal pehle 50 fisadi ank laane aavashyak hote the, jiske liye ummidavaaron ko 720 ankon main se 360 ank laane hote the
 But now candidates have to bring only 145 marks out of 720 for 50 percentile number, which is only 20 percent
 isliye neet main 18 se 20 fisadi ank laakar bhi embibies main admician hasil kar sakate hai
 This is how admission in AIIMS is, according to the celebshipport of the entrance exam, the general category candidates are required to get 697 to 131 marks, which gives 50 percentile and it is just 18 of the total marks
 2 fisadi he
 14 to OBC
 9, divyang ummidavaaron ko 16
 4 percent, 14 to obc's disabled candidates
 9 fisadi ank laana aavashyak hota he

 Reacting to Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani's allegation against Patel, Congress spokesperson Surjewala said, "the BJP is afraid of defeat in Gujarat and therefore in panic it is making fabricated allegations against others
 sachai kii jeet hogi or gujarat main bijepi kii haar hogi
 "he said that the BJP is conspiring against the Congress MP, whereas the BJP needs to look inside itself
 'ahamed patel ke khilaaf bijepi kii sajeesh'surajevaala ne kaha, "sardaar patel aspataal ek cheritable aspataal he, jisamen 150-200 karmchaaree kaam karte hai
 Neither Ahmed Patel nor other members of his family are trustees of the hospital
 ve log aspataal se hone vaale kisi phaayde se bhi nahin jude hai
 Stimberwala was an employee there
 " unhone kaha ki agar sandigdh aatankwaadi ke khilaaf saboot he to aties isaki jaanch kare
 The spokesperson said, "the Gujarat chief minister has tried to plot a conspiracy against Congress leader Ahmed Patel to hide his incompetence, which is quite a disgusting attempt
 patel ke khilaaf aarope aadharahin hai
 "'IS agents arrested in mp's connection to BJP'," Surjewala said, "congress has always fought against terrorism, whereas BJP has a contrary record in it

 unamem se ek dhruv saxena bijepi ke iti cell kaa sadsy tha

 ' Like Adib Chetan Bhagat, those who blame English for the creation of a new caste system, should consider that being the language of democracy, human rights and equal opportunity, English has, for the last three centuries, indigenous caste of India
 Has played an important role in fighting oppression, political absolutism and religious conservatism

 Why did he take refuge in English education and Western liberalism under Ambedkar's leadership? Many Dalits still consider English to be the goddess of their education
 isi tarah ve 1830 ke dashak main angreji ko bharat main laane vaale victoria kaal ke vidwaan lord maikole kii izzat karte hai or unke janmdin 25 aktubar ko angreji diwas ke rup main manaate hai
 Macaulay was motivated more by practical motives rather than ideology
 britani hukmaranon ko tamilnadu, bengal or maharashtra sareekhe alag-alag bhashaaon vaale kshetron main hukumat karne ke liye ek sampark bhashaa kii jarurat thi
 Even after almost two centuries, that administrative imperative of English is not only still intact, but has increased more than before
 centre sarkaar 70 saal se hindi ko badhaava dene ke liye joardaar abhiyaan chalaati rahi he
 Despite this, even today, less than half the population of India speaks Hindi and in the southern and north-eastern areas of the country, it is more alien language than English
 kya bharat main angrejibhashi logon kaa ek kuleen tabaka he, jo dusron kaa daman karata he? agar aap hindustan ke aadhunik itihaas ko dekhen, to sachaai iske ulat he
 Macaulay had then correctly conceived that with the help of English, Indians would be able to explore the global progress in science, medicine and technology
 vakt ne unhen sahi sabit kiya he
 Today, many countries from Scandinavia to China are adopting English as their language of higher education
 maikole ne yah bhi dekh liya tha ki angreji bharat main udaar rajnatik or aarthik vichaar failaaegi or aakhirkaar hindustaniyon ko apane britani hukmaranon kii rajnatik barabari main laa khadaa karegi
 History then proved him right
 yahi vajah thi ki pashchimi shiksha main paley-bade vakeelon ne bharat ko aazaadee dilaai or secular jamhuriyat ke taur par kaayam kiya
 He even accepted a parliament based on the Westminster model
 bharat ke aupniveshik kaal se pehle ke itihaas main megna carta sareekhee ghatana duusari nahin he
 If it was not English, it would have been very difficult for India to adopt the rule of law, as there was no concept of this concept in the country before
 us vakt manamaane dasturon or dharmik nishedhon kii vyavastha lagu thi, jo kanoon kii hukumat se bilkul alahada thi
 Similarly, there is no equal judicial system based on equality before law, because it is an equally foreign concept
 or aakhir meh aam jabaan kii taur par angreji ke jariye mulk ko jodgaye vaali aupniveshik hukumat nahin hoti, to rajnatik ikai ke taur par hindustan kaa koi vajood nahin hota
 It was more than possible that this subcontinent would have been divided into quarreling quarrels, some of which might have been unjust

 panikkar ke lafjon ko maikole kii viraasat par antim faisla mana ja saktaa he
 He has written, "it is the result of this man's great talent that modern India could do the present

 There is also no evidence that English is hurting indigenous languages
 angreji bolne vaale zyaadaatar hindustani apni gharelu jindagi main ‘‘desi’’ bhashaaon kaa prayog karte hai
 Their English is also quite different from the original English of the ancient colonial nobility
 isiilie ise hinglish kaha jaataa he
 It is spoken in very common colloquial accents and is not like that creepy Sanskritic Hindi which was fabricated in the middle of the 20th century and imposed on us
 hamaari angreji kii viraasat kii jo sabase beshkeemtee cheez he, thik usee kii vajah se ise dharmik or saanskrithik kattarpathiyon ke hamalon kaa shikaar hona padataa he
 The English language forms liberal, secular and scientific views
 isamen vaisaa bojhli or besanga shabdadambar bhi nahin he, jo hindiwaalon ko hamaare samvidhan kii buniyadi baton ko samajhane ke liye gadhia padaa tha
 English is our window to the movements, ideas and technology around the world and our safeguard against narrow nationalism and arbitrary rule

 ) In Bhopal, a schoolgirl has designed an umbrella that will not only protect from sun and rain, but will also give air when needed
 is chaate ko kuch is tarah se taiyaar kiya gaya he ki isamen roshni ke liye torch or hawa ke liye pankhaa laga hua he
 Riya Jain (12), a sixth grade student of St

 sthaneey log ladakh ko kashmir se alag kiye jane ke faisle se khushalddakh ab union territary yani centre shasit pradesh ban gaya hailaddakh ko alag pahchaan dilaane ke liye ilaake main lagaataar sangharsh hote rahehimalay kii god main basaa ladakh ab centreshasit pradesh ban gaya he
 Ladakh, a sparsely populated region, is an important region connected by two countries
 bharat kii sansad main somvaar ko jo aitihaasik prastaav laayaa gaya usne na sirf ladakh kaa itihaas balki bhugol bhi badal diya
 In this, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh have been made two Union territories
 ladakh kaa states chandigarh jaisaa hoga
 Things are normal at Leh's Rinpoche Airport
 sailaani aa rahe hai
 The picture is normal on the streets
 airport par sailaaniyon ke intjaar main khadey sthaneey tourist guide ladakh ko nai pahchaan milane se khush hai
 Local driver Rinche says that she is very happy with this decision as it has been an old demand of Ladakh
 leh main skool college khule hai
 Traffic on roads is normal
 dukaane lagi hai
 The people of Leh have welcomed this decision of the Modi government with an open heart
 leh ke sabase pramukh bazaar main 20 saal se kaarobaar kar rahe namdak lods kehete hai, 'ham saalon se isaki maang kar rahe the kyonki kashmir ne kabhi ladakh ko apana nahin samajha
 Now hopefully we will be well 'sthaneey log or leh ke bazaar main jivan yaapan karne vaale bhi ladakh ko kashmir se alag kiye jane ke faisle se khush hai
 This small part of Jammu and Kashmir has got its distinct identity
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar ke grih mantri amit shah ne desh kii sansad main kashmir se anuchhed 370 radd karne ke saath hi jammu or kashmir ke vibhaajan kaa jo masauda saamne rakhaa, uske mutabik ladakh ab union territary yani centre shasit pradesh ban gaya he
 According to the new map drawn in Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh will be the ninth union territory of India, spread over a wide size, combining the two districts of Leh and Kargil
 itnaa hi nahin ladakh ko ye pahchaan purv or pashchim main pakistan or china kii seemaa ko dekhte hue bhi ye kadam behad mahatvapurn he
 The people of Ladakh had been demanding separation from them for years, Ladakh, which is considered a famous center of Buddhism in India and a separate identity of its own for decades
 1947 ke baad se hi jammu-kashmir ke dhaanche main ladakh maujuud to tha lekin jammu kashmir kii siyasat main use uskaa haq nahin mil paaya
 Perhaps this is why the people of Ladakh have been demanding separation for years
 ladakh buddhist association ke adhyaksh pi tii kunjang kaa kahana he, '1949 main hi ladakh ke buddha isht association ne tatkaaleen pradhanmantri nehru se darkhaast kii thi ki ladakh ko jammu kashmir kaa hissaa nahin banaaya jaae, vikaas ladakh tak nahin pahunchataa or na hi jammu kashmir kii sarkaar ladakh par dhyaan detii he
 According to the Ladakh Buddhist Association, there have been continuous struggles in the area for several decades to separate Ladakh and separate it from Kashmir
 kuch dashak pehle aise hi andolan main ladakh ke 3 bachche bhi maare gaye
 The Modi government's policy behind making Ladakh a union territory may also be because Ladakh is important not only geographically but also strategically for India

 It is worth mentioning that it was reported in the media that the Congress in-charge of Bihar, Gulchain Singh Charak, had not given approval to the agitational program prepared by the state unit of the party against the NDA government of the state

 But in the ec's affidavit, the 12th dispute is the second: the second 'stain' on the house is very much more serious
 1999 main un par ek mahila ke makaan main gaiyrkanoonee nirmaan karwaakar jagah kabjane kaa aarope laga tha
 The case went to court and in 2007 the court ordered to seize the occupied space and open the locks

 During this time she used to be a BJP corporator

 The party also claims to withdraw the ticket from the candidates if the allegations are found true
 bhaavana goud par aaropon kaa maamla pichhali baar bhi saamne aayaa tha, lekin party ne jaanch ke baad unhen clin chit di thi
 This year the complaint has come again, then the committee of the party is investigating
 haalanki palam main AAP kaaryakartaaon kaa ek samooh party netritv se naaraa he or bhaavana goud kaa naam waapas liye jane kii maang kar rahaa he
 reply of the Bay lifeparty spokesperson of the court in Bhavna Gaur's case, although the party was not formally saying anything about it
 AAP pravaktaa aatishi marlena se jab is bare main baat hui to unhone sirf itnaa kaha ki agar kisi pratyaashee ke khilaaf shikaayat aati he to un aaropon kii jaanch karne ke liye ek cameti he
 If Bhawna Gaur complains, she will also be investigated
 aatishi se jab poocha gaya ki kya bhaavana ke khilaaf koi shikaayat party forum main kii gai he, to unhone ise party kaa andruni masalaa bataaya or jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 Not a matter of Bhavana vs Milan! Sources are suggesting that Bhavna is avoiding cutting the ticket of Gaur because she has no stronger candidate than Palam than Bhavna
 har haal main satta main vaapasi kii koshish kar rahi AAP 'kamjor' pratyaashee utaarne kaa jokhim nahin lenaa chaahati
 However, Milan was also in the race for tickets
 milan shahid manjunath ke bachmet rahe hai or yahaan kaaryakartaaon kaa ek gut unhen tikat die jane ke paksh main tha
 According to sources, the party leaders know that Milan's supporters are deliberately airing Bhavna Gaur's controversy
 haalanki AAP kaaryakartaaon ke us gut kaa kahana he ki agar party bhaavana goud kaa naam waapas lekar misaal pesh karti he to ve party ke saath kandhe se kandhaa milakar chalane ko taiyaar hai

 Although Kapil apologized to him and asked him to come back on the show several times, but this time Sunil is adamant

 Amid the ongoing controversy over the slogan of 'bharat Mata Ki Jai', BJP MP and actor Paresh Rawal said on Sunday that his party never forced anyone to chant this slogan and force people to do so
 is unfair
 paresh rawal ne yah baat darul ulum devband kii ore se jari us fatve par pratikriya jataate hue kahi jisamen muslimon se yah naaraa lagane se dur rahane ke liye kaha gaya he
 Rawal said that to say 'bharat Mata Ki Jai' is to express patriotism
 unhone kaha ki logon ko is mudde par geetkaar javed akhtar kaa anusaran karnaa chahie jinka rajyasabha ke sadsy ke taur par kaarykaal pichley maheene samaapt hua tha
 He told reporters, 'it is all about how much you love your motherland
 jo fatwa jari karnaa chaahate hai, ve kar sakate hai
 Otherwise people should follow Javed Akhtar, who said in Parliament that it is my right to say 'bharat Mata ki Jai'
 ' tippaniyan BJP MP from Ahmedabad (east) Rawal said, 'BJP has never forced anyone to chant this slogan and it is not fair to force anyone to do it
 yah deshbhakti kii bhaavana vyakt karnaa he
 (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Paresh Rawal said this while reacting to the edict issued by Darul Uloom Deoband asking Muslims to abstain from raising this slogan
 rawal ne kaha ki 'bharat mata kii jai' kahana rashtrabhakti abhivyakt karnaa he
 He said that people should follow lyricist Javed Akhtar, whose tenure as a Rajya Sabha member ended last month
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'yah sab isko lekar he ki aap apni mathrubhumi ko kitna prem karte hai
 Those who want to issue fatwas, they can
 anyathaa logon ko javed akhtar kaa anusaran karnaa chahie, jinhone sansad main kaha tha ki 'bharat mata kii jai kahana meraa adhikaar he
 Comments ahmedabad (purv) se bijepi saansad rawal ne kaha, 'bijepi ne kabhi kisi ko yah naaraa lagane ke liye baadhya nahin kiya or kisi ko bhi yah karne ke liye baadhya karnaa uchit bhi nahin he
 It is to express the spirit of patriotism

 jamaane baad channelon par mantrimandal vistaar se judi charchaaen sun rahaa tha
 i am convinced that nothing has changed in the capital Delhi
 vahi batiyaa sari ratiyaa
 If the politics of the state can be changed through ministers, then all the ministers can be made from UP and two hundred seats out of four hundred can be won there
 bihar main bhi jeeta ja saktaa tha
 In this context, no party ever loses elections after coming to power
 har rajya or jati kaa mantri bana den
 Will the problem of Dalits be solved by making Dalits a minister? When all the issues from Rohit Vemula to the Dalits continued to arise, then where was this Tamta, Raj, Meghwal or Athawale
 jab bihar chunaav ke samay aarakshan samaapt karne kaa masalaa uthaa to ye dalit chehre kyon nahin saamne aae
 Even his statements were not heard
 phir inke mantri banate hi kaise maan liya jaataa he daliton kaa pratinidhitiv ho gaya
 The BJP has the most Dalit mps
 phir rashtriya adhyaksh ko kumbh main samarasata snaan kii raajnneeti kyon kerani padi? kya unke saath baaki dalit saansad bhi snaan karne gaye the? upi ke kaaran dalit saansad mantri bane hai to udit raaj main koun-si kami thi? kya dalit hone ke kaaran inhen bada mantralay bhi milegaa? vitt rajya mantri banenge yaa samaaj kalyaan yaa bal kalyaan mantri hi banate rahenge
 Are these Dalit mps or ministers of state becoming cabinet ministers? What work the state ministers have is missing from sudden discussions
 tivi ke inhen jaankaron ke dwaara arun jetali or calraj mishra ko brahman cheharaa bataaya ja chukaa he
 What is the point of telling Mahendra Pandey a Brahmin face while Kalraj Mishra? Is Mahendra Pandey a bigger leader than Kalraj Mishra or is Kalraj Mishra no longer a Brahmin leader? RSS chiefs are usually Brahmins
 bijepi main bhi kai brahman netaa sthapit hai
 Can not all these Brahmins bring votes in UP
 mujhe kai baar samaj nahin aata ki kis aadhaar par ham kisi kii jati ko raajnneeti se bada dekhne lagate hai
 If these mps have been formed on the basis of elections and caste, then from the first expansion after two years, it seems that not only Modi but Indian politics has no new idea
 do saansadon kii cycle se sansad aane kii tasviir kii kaaphi charchaa hui
 It is a commendable work without doubt
 lekin unhen paryaavaran kaa pratinidhi cheharaa banane se pehle kam se kam yah to dekh liya jaataa ki sarkaar kii paryaavaran kii nitiyaan kya hai
 What are their effects? cycle hi antim pratinidhi he to phir niti kya he
 By the way, Meghwal has been elected the best parliamentarian and has administrative experience
 lekin unke jaise tamaam dalit saansad jab dalit muddon ke samay saamne nahin aate to mantri banate hi kaise ye upi se lekar bharat ke tamaam daliton ke pratinidhi ban jate hai
 o experts, in this context, the Prime Minister should do this, that Sharma, Patel, Singh, Sinha of all the major castes should be made to sleep by making them ministers
 aisa nahin he ki main kuch alag tareeke se charchaa karata
 i would have been doing all these things if i were
 shaayad isiilie lag rahaa he ki bharat kii raajnneeti or uske vishleshak jad ho chuke hai
 They have no new scale
 hamaari raajnneeti main sab kuch hamaare paidaa hone se pehle tay ho chukaa he
 We have all come into the world to raise him! Every anchor is telling the other person right that you know UP better than others
 aap modi ko sabase behatar jaanate hai
 What are you saying, new experts, who know you better than all the people? tail me na!tippaniyan If politics is just a game of image and projection then the public should watch TV all day long
 use naukari, taraqqi or sasti padhai or saste aspataal kii jagah apni jati ke mantriyon ke naam passbook main likhte rahanaa chahie
 The ministers who have been made earlier also represent age, caste and experience
 wo bhi isi tarah se bataaye gaye
 What has been their performance on those scales? Anyone can tell Had Assam lost, would the Prime Minister and Shah resign? Aren't they already strong? If victory is the strength of their strength, then will Shah be sent to Gujarat after losing UP? centre hi nahin rajyon main bhi yahi hota he
 What is the good of the public due to this
 kya ye chehre kisi niti kaa bhi pratinidhitiv karte hai? kya inaki apni koi soch he? kya ye sabhi apane dam par chunaav jeetne kii kshamta rakhte hai? aaj upi ke jitne mantri jati or ilaake kaa cheharaa bataaye ja rahe hai koi dil par haath rakh kar kahe ki kya ye sabhi bina modi lahar ke 2014 main chunaav jeet jate? kya aapane chunaavon ke dauraan krishna raaj, mahendra pandey kaa naam suna tha? do teen din se sun rahe hai yaa varshon se? sabhi nae mantriyon ko shubhakamanaayen
 Will the problem of Dalits be solved by making Dalits a minister? When all the issues from Rohit Vemula to the Dalits continued to arise, then where was this Tamta, Raj, Meghwal or Athawale
 jab bihar chunaav ke samay aarakshan samaapt karne kaa masalaa uthaa to ye dalit chehre kyon nahin saamne aae
