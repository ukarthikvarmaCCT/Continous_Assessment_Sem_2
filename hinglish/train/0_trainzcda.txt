 5-ankhon dekhi (2014)- ye film rajat kapur ke jivan kii sabase safal film he

 The film portrays many philosophical aspects of life

 Know whether it was due to any fear or due to satisfaction

 8 agast, 2010 ke baad se bihar main 10,000 se zyada bandooken baraamad kii gai hai
 Most of these guns have been recovered while being shipped to other states
 bihar main avaidh hathiyaaron ke kaarkaanon kaa lagaataar bhandaphod hota rahaa he, bhale hi rajya main in avaidh hathiyaaron kii maang main kami aa gai ho
 This means that the police has failed to stop the trade of illegal guns from the state
 munger main bandook ke sarkari kaarkaanon main kaam karne vaale kai karigar kam vetan ke kaaran naukariyaan chhod chuke hai
 Many of these artisans have been kept in illegal arms suppliers by paying them high salaries
 ye bandooksaaj nakli banduukon par 'maid in america' yaa 'maid in euke' uker dete hai
 Munger's proximity to the railway's old city of Jamalpur with several engineering workshops makes it easy for illegal arms manufacturers to gather essential materials such as iron and steel
 chintaa kii ek baat yah bhi he ki bihar main bani avaidh bandooken naksaliyon tak bhi pahunch rahi hai
 In December 2009, the Bihar police caught four gun making factories and arrested six people when they gave weapons to the Naxalites in Jharkhand
 
 aisi sabase taaja baramadagi is varsh 4 janvari ko kii gai thi, jab sena ke ek sevanivrutt jawan mohammad qayyum ko carbine or pistaulen pashchim bengal le jate samay pakadaa gaya
 The police were aware that supplying arms to West Bengal, which is on the threshold of elections, is the biggest priority of Bihar's illegal arms suppliers
 bihar main avaidh hathiyaaron ke kaarkaanon kii lagaataar kii ja rahi dharpakad ne kuch nirmaataaon ko apana adda pados ke jharkhand main le jane ke liye bhi majaboor kar diya he
 In October 2010, the Jharkhand Police arrested eight people, six of them from Munger, operating an illegal arms factory in Dhanbad
 unke kabje se tees pistaulen baraamad kii gai thim
 From Surat to Delhi and Hyderabad to Punjab and Madhya Pradesh, recent arrests across the country also confirm that Bihar's arms suppliers have been working day and night to meet the growing demand
 
 patna main chhitput aparaadh karne vaala 25 varsh kaa vikram hiron ke shahar surat main hathiyaar supplai kar rahaa tha, jahaan use is maheene kii shuruyaat main giraftaar kiya gaya
 In November last year, the Delhi Police demolished another Bihar-based gang of arms, in which ten people were arrested and a huge consignment of arms was recovered
 bihar ke hathiyaar sapliron ke khilaaf ek or badi safalataa 19 janvari ko tab mili, jab police ne lakhanu main aarif or gita ko pakadaa or unke kabje se 
 32 bore pistols were recovered
 munger kii rahane vaali gita maal dhulaai karne waalon main se thi
 It seems that the gun suppliers have finally got into the eyes of the police
 desh main lav jihad kaa mudda ek baar phir charchaa main he
 Meanwhile, the Hindu Jagran Manch has given a controversial statement to teach a lesson to the love jihadis

 hadiya maamle kii vajah se dobaaraa charchaa main muddabata den ki kerala ke kathith lav jihad maamle ke baad se hi lav jihad ek baar phir charchaa main hai
 Recently, Hadiya had appeared in the Supreme Court regarding this case
 akhila ashokan se hadiya banane ke maamle main usne jaj se kaha ki vah apni aazaadee chaahati he
 Her husband is able to take care of her
 pati ke saath rahakar vah apni padhai jari rakhana chaahati he
 The next hearing will be in the third week of January
 supreme court main hadiya ne kaha ki vah apni aazaadee chaahati he
 The court asked him, 'do you want to continue studying at the expense of the state government? What are your dreams? To this, Hadiya said, 'I want to meet my husband
 apni padhai jari rakhana chaahati hum, lekin rajya sarkaar ke kharche par nahin
 My husband is able to take care of me
 'aakhir hota kya he ye lav jihadalav jihad do shabdon se milakar bana he
 The English language word love means love, love, love and the Arabic word jihad
 jiskaa matlab hota he kisi makasad ko puraa karne ke liye apni puri takat laga dena
 That is, when the girls of another religion, who believe in a particular religion, get their girl converted to their religion by trapping them, then this whole process is called love jihad
 ab agar aap lav jehad kaa matlab samaj gaye hai to aapako ye bhi bataa den ki abtak lav jehad shabd ko kanoonee manyata praapt nahin thi
 But now the Supreme Court has accepted that love is jihad and Muslim youth convert Hindu girls to their love trap by making them convert their religion to love jihad
 isaki shuruyaat tab hui jab kerala hoicourt ne 25 may ko hindu mahila akhila ashokan kii shaadi ko radd kar diya tha
 Akhila Ashokan married Muslim man Shafin in December 2016

 While the Aam Aadmi Party and BJP are accusing each other of doing politics on the ceiling, BJP Akali MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa and AAP rebel MLA Kapil Mishra held a press conference and took on the Kejriwal government for sealing
 
 press conference main donon netaaon ne elaan kiya he ki 16 march se dilli vidhansabha kaa bajet satr shuru ho rahaa he jisapar bijepi akali vidhayak manjinder singh sirsa or 'aap' kebaagi vidhayak kapil mishrane maang kii he ki kejariwal sarkaar ceiling ke khilaaf vidhansabha main bill lekar aaen or phir sweekruti ke liye centre sarkaar ko bhejein, nahin to phir bijepi akali vidhayak manjinder singh sirsa or kapil mishra privet member bill lekar aaenge
 Taking a dig at the Kejriwal government with questions, both the leaders said that the Delhi government has come to consciousness very late and still the spectacle is on the policy of more work and less work
 dilli sarkaar turant supreme court ko sarkaar va vidhansabha donon kii raay se avgat karawaaye or bajet satr ke pehle hi din vidhansabha main ceiling virdohi kanoon laayaa jaae
 He also said that if the Kejriwal government does not bring legislation in the Legislative Assembly, we will bring a private member bill against sealing
 dilli sarkaar ko supreme court main senior vakil bhejne honge or court ko DDA ke amendament par apni raay se avgat karwaanaa hoga
 He also whipped the Kejriwal government over the budget
 kapil mishra ne kaha ki kejariwal kehete the ki wo dilli kaa bajet janata se poochkar banaaenge aakhir wo bajet ke liye janata se kab puuchhenge

 The name of the bill is 'the Muslim Women Protection of Rights in Marriage Act'

 That is, when the triple talaq is not considered, then what will be punished for it? 2- Along with triple talaq, the government also wants to eliminate other provisions of divorce
 talaak muslim purushon ko shariat se mila adhikaar he
 How can the government take away this right? 3-the divorce case comes under the Civil Act, which the government is making a criminal act through the bill
 agar aisa hua to kya talaak ke baad pati-patni ke bich sulah kii gunjaaish khatm nahin ho jaaegi?4-sarkaar is bill ke jarieislamic shariat main dakhsandajikarna chaahati he
 The constitution has given the Muslim community the right to live according to their religion

 bina muslimon se vichaar vimarsh ke sarkaar kaise unke liye kanoon bana sakati he?6-bill ke tahat bacchon kii castady kaa bhi praavdhaan he ki bachche maa ke paas rahenge
 This will increase the burden on poor families, women who do not want to have children, they will have to keep children under compulsion
 muslimon mahilaon kii garibi jagajaahir he
 7- Under the provision of the new bill, an unknown person can also complain about triple talaq, in which the wife's complaint is not necessary
 aise main agar patni nahin chaahati ki uskaa pati jail jaae, to bhi kisi duusare ke shikaayat par use jail bhej diya jayega
 In such a situation, the family will be broken
 8- When the husband goes to jail by divorcing, then who will give his wife alimony? hastshilp niryaatak ke taur par kapadaa mantralay se kai puraskaar praapt kar chuke dilli ke rajesh jain ne film nirmaataa ke taur par bhi dhamaakedaar pari kaa aagaaz kar diya he

 ye mendhak kii tarah ek party se duusari party main kudate hai, vichaardhaaraein peeche chhot jaati hai, kursi kaa moh sarvopari ho jaataa he
 Although these trends are always there, but during the election season, they come out in the open
 kal tak jinhen bhala-bura kehete rahe, ve achaanak sabase achche ho jate hai
 The latest incident is that of Congress candidate Ramesh Chandra Tomar from Gautam Buddha Nagar
 ye bijepi ke saansad rahe hai, lekin 2009 main gajiabad seat se bijepi kii taraf se rajnath singh ke utarane se naaraaz ho gaye or party chhodkar congress main shaamil ho gaye
 In this election, the Congress gave him a ticket from Gautam Buddha Nagar
 jor-shor se prachaar main jute the
 Suddenly, i changed myself overnight
 matdaan se sirf hafte bhar pehle congress chhodkar bijepi main shaamil ho gaye
 Even if Ramesh Chandra Tomar is a trophy for the BJP, which the BJP has shown at Narendra Modi's Indirapuram rally as the winner, it is a shameful incident for politics
 'aayaa ram gaya ram' kii raajnneeti main netaaon ko chunaav jeetne yaa ladane se pehle to paala badalte dekha gaya, magar ain chunaav ke dauraan paala badalane ke aise kisse kam hi hai
 That too when a leader has filled the form on behalf of the party
 aisa hi madhya pradesh ke bhind main hua
 The Congress had announced Bhagirath Prasad as its candidate from there, but he left the Congress and joined the BJP and the BJP made him its candidate
 bhagirath prasad kaa maamla thodaa alag bhi maan sakate hai, kyonki unhone congress usee din chodi, jis din unhen congress ne apana ummidavaar banaaya
 After joining BJP, Congress fielded another candidate there, but the case of Ramesh Chandra Tomar is completely different
 bijepi main shaamil hone ke baavjood, vah ab bhi congress ke pratyaashee hai
 On April 10, when the voters of Gautam Buddha Nagar go to vote, they will see the name of Ramesh Chandra Tomar on the EVM and there will be a claw of their hands in front of their name
 congress ke paas ab iske alaava koi chaara nahin he ki vah kisi duusari party ke ummidavaar ko apana samarthan ghoshit kare
 Interestingly, if Tomar wins the election, he will be a Congress MP
 aise main unki sadsyta bhi turant hi ja sakati he, kyonki un par dalbadal virdohi kanoon ke tahat karrwai ho sakati he
 In such a situation, elections may have to be held again in Gautam Buddha Nagar
 jaahir he ye kaalpanik drishy hai
 But this has brought a big swing in the electoral process that what will happen if a candidate changes the party after filling the nomination? buudhvaar raat ko jab khabaren ain ki ramesh chandra tomars congress chhod kar bijepi main shaamil ho rahe hai, tab unhone in khabaron kaa purazor dhang se khandan kiya
 Threatened to complain to the Election Commission against news channels
 aadhi raat main press conference kar kaha ki vah congress main hi rahenge
 It also said that those who are saying that they will file a defamation case against them
 tomars ke bete ne media main phone kar khabaron kaa khandan kiya
 On Thursday morning, when Congress leaders called him and asked where he was, he said that he had gone to the Election Commission office to complain
 yah baat kuch had tak sahi thi, kyonki vah ashok road par hi the
 The only difference was that Tomar was on the chair of BJP President Rajnath Singh, next to the Election Commission office on Ashok Road, where Rajnath Singh rejoined the BJP by giving him a slip of five rupees
 bijepi ho yaa congress jis bhi raajnneetik dal ko duusare kii fajihat karne kaa mauka miltaa, ve jarur aisa hi karte hai
 Shortly before, the Congress had raised questions about the marital life of Narendra Modi from his platform with Atal Bihari Vajpayee's niece Karuna Shukla
 lekin bada sawaal aise netaaon ke bare main he jinaki aasthaaen badalane main chand minute hi lagate hai
 Sabir Ali, who was cursing Modi by drinking water, came to the BJP praising Modi and within 24 hours exited the other door
 yaa to ek-duusare ko nicha dikhaane ke raajnneetik dalon ke khel main in netaaon ko apane laabh ke liye moharon kii tarah istemaal hone se parhez nahin he yaa phir ve ye maanakar chalate hai ki ve chahen jo karen, log unhen kuch nahin kahenge
 But is that really so? rafel vimaan saude ko lekar congress ne modi sarkaar ke khilaaf hallaa bol diya he
 After raising the question of party president Rahul Gandhi, now the Congress has completely entered the ground to create an atmosphere against the Modi government with the help of Rafael
 congress ne rafel deal ko modi kii 'personal deal' naam diya he
 Congress has issued a letter saying that Modi ji went to Paris personally, signed the Rafale deal himself and changed the personal deal
 congress ne piem modi se rafel par 10 sawaalon kii suchi jari kii he
 Congressmen will go public throughout the country and spread the Rafale Deal
 rahul gandhi ne uthaaya tha sawalbata den ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne mangalavar ko piem modi par ghapale tak kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Rahul said that Modi ji himself had gone to Paris to make this agreement, after all why the country is not being told how much the deal was done
 rahul gandhi ne kaha, 'rafel deal par aap kyon nahin bolte ho? aaj tak aisa hua he ki raksha mantri kahe rafel kitne main kharida gaya he, ye nahin bataaenge
 Won't tell the country, Modi ji has done a scam, i know you are afraid
 'congress ne jari kiye das sawaal1

 The recent statement of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, who is trying to resolve the temple-mosque dispute outside the court in Ayodhya, is being condemned
 shrishri ke syria vaale bayaan se shivasena khaasi naaraaz he
 Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut says that Shiv Sena does not accept the statement of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar on the Ayodhya dispute
 ort of living ke pramukh shrishri ravishankar ne kaha tha ki agar ayodhya masalaa nahin sulajhaa to bharat kaa haal bhi syria jaisaa ho saktaa he
 Shiv Sena has misinformed Shri Shri Kebayan
 sanjay raut ne sawaal kiya he ki aise bayaan dekar ravishankar desh ko kahaan le janaa chaahate hai
 'shree Shree has nothing to do with Ayodhya matter' Sanjay Raut says that this is a very irresponsible statement from Shree Shree Ravi Shankar
 raut ne kaha, 'mujhe lagata he shri shri ravishankar kaa is maamle se koi sambandh nahin he
 When the Babri Masjid was falling apart
 ham log vahaan the
 i was also one of them
 ''ek hi mudde par nahin honi chahie 10 baat'sanjay raut kaa maananaa he ki subramanyam swami koshish kar rahe hai, court main unki ladaai chal rahi he
 Work is also going on outside
 10 log ek hi mudde par 10 munh se bolenge to maamla bighad jayega
 'shiv Sena is sitting, Syria will not become this country' According to Raut, the matter of Syria is not in the interest of the country
 jab-jab loksabhaa chunaav aata he to log aisi baat karte hai
 Sanjay Raut said that to pursue Kirvishankar is someone's electoral politics
 yah desh syria nahin banegaa
 This country is not like this and if someone tries to do this, Shiv Sena is sitting
 'hindu-muslim ko baantne kii sajeesh'sanjay raut ne kaha, 'ram mandir bananaa chahie har koi chahta he
 Everyone wants to take credit for it, if you have to take credit, take it, but the idea of making Hindustan Kosariya is wrong
 aap ek baar phir hindu-musalmaan ko baant kar is maamle main raajnneeti karnaa chaahate hai
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has also criticized Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's statement in the mouthpiece Saamana

 You can play PUBG and Call of Duty: Mobile, but you will have to play by lowering the settings
 software kii baat karen to Nokia 7

 Khande said: Mandesh Hussain Dalwai, found to sit in the opposition, advocated support to Shiv Sena The results of the assembly elections in Maharashtra have been nine days, but suspense is still on to form the government
 satta ke galiyaaron main tamaam sawaalon par manthan chal rahaa he or netaa bayaanbaji kar rahe hai, lekin sarkaar banane ko lekar tasviir saaf nahin ho paa rahi he
 The Shiv Sena has been adamant on demanding a split of two-and-a-half years of power, but the BJP is not ready to accept
 vahiin, sanjay raut ensipi supremeo sharad pavaar se mil chuke hai, to congress main bhi shivasena ko samarthan dene par manthan chal rahaa he
 The rhetoric of leaders is coming out in the midst of all these developments
 shivasena ko samarthan dene par congress banty hui he
 Congress leaders have come face to face on the issue of supporting Shiv Sena
 haalanki congress haikaman ne abhi tak apane pattey nahin khole hai
 On Friday, Maharashtra Congress leaders met Sonia Gandhi
 maharashtra congress netaaon ke pratinidhimandal main balasaheb thoraat, ashok chouhan, prithviraj chouhan or manikarav thakare samet anya shaamil rahe
 In this meeting, the Congress high command has asked the leaders of Maharashtra for weight and watch
 congress netaa khadge bole- maharashtra main vipaksh main baithengecongress ke diggaj netaa mallikarjun khadge ne shivasena ko samarthan dene se inkaar kiya he
 Also said to sit in opposition
 shivasena netaa sanjay raut ke bayaan par mallikarjun khadge ne kaha, 'main yah bilkul spasht karnaa chahta hum ki hamane shivasena ke saath milakar sarkaar banane par kisi bhi tarah kii koi charchaa nahin kii he

 is dauraan congress netamallikarjun khadgene bijepi par karaara hamalaa bhi bolaa
 He said that BJP can do anything for power
 vah loktantric tareeke se kaam nahin karti he
 BJP wants to threaten people to dominate
 bijepi or shivasena kii vichaardhaara ne logon ko bhaybheet kar diya he
 They should patronize those who support their ideology
 bijepi or shivasena nishchit rup se phir milenge or aage kii charchaa shuru karenge
 Hussain Dalwai in favor of supporting Shiv Sena, while some Congress leaders are in favor of supporting Shiv Sena
 congress netaa hossain dalwai ne daleel di ki bijepi or shivasena main jameen-aasmaan kaa antar he
 There is a difference in Hindutva between the two
 bijepi ek desh, ek party or ek dharm kii baat karti he, jabaki shivasena aisi baat kabhi nahin karti he
 Shiv Sena also gave tickets to Muslims in elections, but BJP did not give tickets to any Muslims
 shivasenaco samarthan dene kii daleel dete hue congress netaa hossain dalwai ne kaha ki raajnneeti main kuch bhi sambhav he
 All industries in Maharashtra are going to Gujarat
 lihaaja ab congress or ensipi milakar kuch karenge
 He said that Shiv Sena should support, because BJP is destroying Maharashtra
 unhone kaha ki mujhako nahin lagata he ki voter congress ko anti-hindutv party maanate hai
 The Congress leader said that this Maharashtra should remain a secular Maharashtra
 shivasena kaa samarthan karnaa chahie
 He said that Shivaji Maharaj had done the same
 ab maharashtra main kya hoga?maharashtramen abhi tak tasviir saaf nahin ho pai he ki aakhir kiski sarkaar banegi
 What will happen if BJP and Shiv Sena do not form a government together? agar ensipi or congress bhi shivasena ko samarthan nahin dete hai, to sarkaar bananaa mushkil hoga
 The bjp-shiv Sena alliance has got a majority in the Maharashtra elections, but no party has touched the magic figure of 146 seats

 ' Anandiben has shocked everyone by resigning on her Facebook
 bhaajapa ko bhi taiyaari karne kaa samay nahin mila ki wo istife ke pehle kisi naye mukhyamantri ke naam par vichaar karti
 So let's see what the whole process will be next? mangalvaar ko bhaajapa sansadeey board kii baithak he
 It will consider Anandiben's resignation offer
 puri sambhaavna he ki istipha manjuur kar liya jaayegaa
 But there are some people in the party who are thinking that maybe Modi can reject the resignation
 tippaniyan However, no party would want a reluctant Chief Minister in the state
 to jab istipha manjuur ho jaayegaa to party naye mukhyamantri ke chunaav kii prakriya tay karegi
 In this, one or two central observers will be appointed who will come to Gujarat, meet party people and mlas
 unase milakar jaanane kii koshish karenge ki nayaa mukhyamantri koun hona chahie
 In this process, it is also believed that most of the mlas will take the name of Amit Shah
 phir kendriya netritv se baatcheet karke ek naam tay kiya jayega
 After that a meeting of BJP Legislature Party will be called
 zyaadaatar sambhaavna yahi he ki nae naam kaa prastaav khud anandiben patel karengi or anya bade netaa uskaa samarthan karenge
 This is a matter of process but the name will be what Narendra Modi would like
 aakhir gujarat unka apana grih rajya he or yahaan ke haikamand sirf or sirf modi hi hai
 The BJP Parliamentary Board has a meeting on Tuesday
 isamen anandiben ke istife kii peshkash par vichaar hoga
 There is every possibility that the resignation will be accepted
 lekin party main kuch log aise bhi hai jo ye kayaas laga rahe hai ki shaayad modi istipha naamanzoor kar sakate hai
 The comments haalanki koi bhi party ek anicchhuk mukhyamantri rajya main nahin chaahegi
 So when the resignation is approved, the party will decide the procedure for the election of the new Chief Minister
 isamen ek yaa do kendriya paryvekshak niyukt kiye jaaenge jo gujarat aaenge, party ke logon se or vidhayakon se milenge
 They will meet and try to know who should be the new Chief Minister
 is prakriya main yah bhi lagbhag tay mana ja rahaa he ki zyaadaatar vidhayak amit shah kaa naam lenge
 Then a name will be decided by talking to the central leadership
 uske baad bhaajapa vidhayak dal kii ek baithak bulaai jaaegi
 Most likely the new name will be proposed by Anandiben Patel herself and other big leaders will support her
 ye to rahi prakriya kii baat lekin naam to vahi hoga jo narendra modi chahenge
 After all, Gujarat is their home state and the high command here is Modi only
 haalanki koi bhi party ek anicchhuk mukhyamantri rajya main nahin chaahegi

 ganga ko mokshadayini nadi kaha jaataa he, lekin badalte bharat kii tasviir ne nadiyon ko bhi badalakar rakh diya
 Cities on the track of development have stopped these rivers as common, but now both the Modi government and the Delhi government have set a target to clean the Ganges and Yamuna
 iske liye nai takneekon kaa istemaal kiya jayega
 Ganga will now be cleaned with biological technology
 kya saaf hogi ganga or yamuna?ganga or yamuna ko aviral karne ko lekar iske pehle bhi kai plan laae ja chuke hai
 The question is, will the Ganges and Yamuna be clean? The water of Ganga and Yamuna is very dirty
 ganga sirf ek nadi nahin he
 She is also the soul of faith and rituals
 ganga safai ke naam par hajaaron karod rupee kharch kar die gaye, lekin ganga saaf nahin ho pai
 While the Modi government has once again started making Ganga pollution free under the 'namami Ganga Project', the Delhi government is also working on several schemes for Yamuna
 haalanki, iskaa koi khaas nateeja nahin niklaa he
 Gangadras Actually, the length of the Ganges is about 2510 kilometers and it passes through seven major states of the country
 jaise-jaisegangabade-bade shaharon se guzarati he
 As such, the city gets garbage and dirty water directly into its water
 2510 kilometre ke ganga ke safar main 140 bade naale hai, jiskaa ganda pani sidhe ganga main girtaa he
 The same situation is also with Yamuna
 dilli main ghuste hi yamuna kaale pani main tabdeel ho jaati he
 There is a drain or a river is not known
 kya jaivik takanic se saaf hogi yamunaymuna safai ko lekar dilli sarkaar ne japani takanic se yamuna kii safai par meeting bhi kii thi, jisamen US ENVIRON naam kii company ne pregentation diya tha
 Apart from Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, Delhi Water Minister Kapil Mishra was also present at the meeting
 company ke prabandh nideshak (emdi) yues sharma ne patna main ganga nadi main girane vaale bakarganj naale kii is takanic se ho rahi safai kaa payalat project bhi unhen dikhaaya
 This work is being done with the approval of the Central Pollution Control Board and the National Ganga River Basin Authority
 company kaa daawa he ki ganga main girane vaale 140 naalon ko do se teen saal main saaf kiya ja sakegaa
 The CM of Delhi has given him the confidence to hand over the work after technical study
 aakhir kya he jaivik takanikais takanic main jwalamukhi kii raakh se pani ko saaf kiya jaataa he
 After that it is mixed with the block and Eco Bio Block is prepared
 iko baio blockse interceptor banaae jate hai, jo naalon main ek nishchit duuri par daal die jate hai
 The dirty water of the drain hits it and the water starts to clear
 saath hi iko baio block ke rasayan main 20 tarah ke jeevanu hote hai, jo pani ke sampark main aate hi sakriy ho jate hai
 This is called aerobic technique
 pradooshit pani inhi jeevanuon kaa bhojan hota he
 These bacteria clean the water at a temperature of 10 to 70 ° C
 das saal tak saaf hota rahegaa paniek baar block banane par das saal tak chaahe naale main jitani bhi gandagi hogi vah saaf hoti jaaegi
 After ten years, this process will have to be repeated only when the sewers are back in the same condition
 agar gandagiganga or yamunaamen jane se ruk jaae or ek nishchit maatra main pani har samay yamuna main rahe to pani ke bahaav ke saath swaabhaavik gandagi dur ho jaaegi
 It has been successful in many countries including Japan
 yues kii company kaa daawa he ki vah ek saath desh kii donon pramukh nadiyon main girane vaale naalon ko saaf karne kii kshamta rakhti he

 un par puranic prasangon se prerit ho ashleel nangi tasviren banane kaa iljaam he
 The live model for these pictures was a prostitute Sugandha
 magar use pataa nahin tha ki usko saamne rakh jo painting banaai ja rahi he, vah yun gali muhalle main tangegi
 Still comes to Sugandha Court
 jamaane bhar ke taane sunate hue
 She tells the judge
 ye sachcha kalakaar he
 So i took off clothes for this
 itnaa kah vah chali jaati he
 And then the king shows his might by riding on a horse of pleas
 vah kahata he ki maine ishwar ko uske abhijatya ghere se mukt kiya
 Made him reach people
 use maanviya banaaya
 He says that all the women whom i have carved with a brush have been deceived by men
 shakuntla, sita, ahilya
 i have freed them
 apni aaazaad kala ke jariye
 However, the verdict is in favor of the king
 vah kuch santushti, kuch abhimaan or kuch darp ke saath court room se nikalataa he
 He feels that he has riddled the Brahminical hypocrisy
 vah sugandha ke ghar daata bhav se pahunchataa he
 But there is a crowd there
 andar kamare main uski kala murda lataki he
 On this occasion, Rang Rasiyaaraja strips Ravi Varma's duel
 uske bheetar ke purush ke kapade utaar detii he
 In art, plead in the court, but the woman who refused to be your inspiration, refused
 use apnaane main kintu parantu
 This weak intellectual argument that you are nowhere outside my imagination
 or yaheen rang rasiyaa ek majboot film ban jaati he
 It does not run towards making anyone great
 magar haa, apane vakt kii tamaam chhichhli ravaayaton ko dikhaati he
 The Rang Rasiya story is the great, revolutionary painter Raja Ravi Varmaki of the 19th century
 kerala ke rahane vaale ravi verma ko vahaan ke raja ne unki kala se prabhavit ho raja kii oopaadhi di
 Raja died, left the protection and then he came to Mumbai
 yahaan unhen gaekwad riyasat kii saraparasti mili
 The king said, make something in the style of Europe
 ravi bole, apane desh main bahut kahaniyaan hai
 i paint them only
 or iske liye pehle desh ghumoonga
 One morning while traveling around the country, Ravi saw his mythological images on the Ghats of Benares
 jisamen vah swayan purush rup main the or unki preyasi yaa kahen ki prerana sugandha stri rup main
 Ravi came back and made a painting
 raja se aagrah kiya ki kala ko janata ke liye khol diya jaae
 Here, when a common man saw the context of Ramayana, he started singing hymns there
 us din ravi ko laga ki ishwar ko panditon se mukt karne kii jarurat he
 Then he ran the printing press at stake
 kala chali, ghar ghar pahunchi
 The king's fame grew and troubles also
 rangarasia film kii khoobiyon par baat pehle
 The film is based on Ranjeet Desai's novel Raja Ravi Verma
 film kii kahani or sandesh prerak hai
 It shows socialism of art
 ravi verma kii logon tak devataaon ko pahunchane kii jid ho yaa phir devi saraswati or lakshmi kii painting ke liye ek aisi stri ko prerana bananaa, jise log bhakthi nahin bhoga ke liye istemaal karte hai
 Anil Mehta's cinematography is very good in the film
 chattan ke kinare abhisar karte premi hon yaa phir painting room main rangon se lathpath keli krida
 Everything looks very auspicious
 iske alaavaarandeep hoodaki acting bhi acchhee he
 In an artist's work that should be 'work', dedication, stubbornness and combativeness
 vah sab unke chehre or deh bhashaa main najar aata he
 His overturning Senko did not act
 vah film kii kamjor kadi hai
 a specialty of Rang Rasiya is its perspective
 yah achhuton, auraton or kranthieta vyaktiyon ko subah kii raushnee main dikhaata he
 It also shows a mirror to a society which is intolerant of religion under the guise of art
 rang rasiyaa ke sahaayak kalakaaron kaa chunaav kamobesh acha he
 Tom Alter in the role of judge, Darshan Jariwala in the role of Chintamani Pandit, Vikram Gokhale in the role of Lawyer, younger brother Raj became Gaurav and Bindaas Bombay Girl Franny became Frayna Vajahir
 film main kai gane hai
 They are neither classless nor uncultivated
 behatar hota ki zyaadaatar film ke parshv main hi baj khatm ho jate
 Their scope in the story would not have to be forcibly created
 film kaa screenple kuch or behatar ho saktaa tha
 It is a little bit swinging
 flashbek or phir usamen bhi flashbek to thik he
 But the stories of many characters remain incomplete
 ve paridrishy se chale jate hai
 Then suddenly they come and what is passed on them in the middle is not told
 or ye sirf kinare ke kirdaaron kii hi baat nahin
 Sugandha also comes under this circle
 film ke saath ek dikkat iske pramotion ko lekar bhi he
 It looks like, Rangarsiya is a celebration of enjoyment, work and body
 jabaki aisa katai nahin he
 Presenting the film in the market from this one angle can give initial headlines, but it brings more wrong kind of audience
 rangarasia ko kai log ‘seen’ dekhne ke liye dekhne jaaenge
 They will not be completely disappointed
 ummid karata hum ki seen ke alaava bhi ve kaaphi kuch dekhen
 The film Rangarasiya is an experimental film
 yah ek aise kalakaar kii jindagi dikhaati he, jo bhagwaan ko insaan ke paas le aayaa
 Free from middlemen
 jinhen li se hatakar dekhnaa pasand he, vah ise dekhen
 Those who have to understand art and its position in 19th century society, see this also
 yah niraash nahin karegi
 Despite the fact that it has been released five years after its creation
 desh, duniya, mahanagar khel, aarthik or bollywood main kya kuch hua

 On January 1, when the whole world was welcoming 2018, many places in Assam had been queuing since morning
 vyakul log naagarikta ke rashtriya register (enarasi) ke pehle masaude main apana naam dhundne kii intjaar main the, jise rajya sarkaar ne thik aadhi raat main jari kiya gaya tha
 This was the second incident of NRC being published anywhere in the country — the first time it was published in 1951
 bhale hi rajnatik dalon or saamaajik kaaryakartaaon ne assam ke logon ko badhai dena shuru kar diya ho—1 karod 90 lakh logon kaa naam enarasi main mil gaya he, jabaki 1 karod 39 lakh logon ke liye satyaapan chal rahaa he—lekin enarasi ko adhyatan karne ko ek vaastaviktaa main badalane kaa shrey 85 varsh ke pradeep gogoi or 43 varsh ke abhijit sarama ko jaataa he
 One of the important clauses of the 1985 Assam Accord was the updating of the NRC of 1951 signed by the Central Government, the Government of Assam and the leaders of the Assam Movement for the purpose of ejecting illegal infiltrators from Assam so that the state would have one of the legitimate citizens
 Be the actual statement
 lekin yah shart kaagaj par hi rah gai
 In 2005, another tripartite agreement was signed by the leaders of the Central Government, Government of Assam and All Assam Students Union
 nae samjhaute ke tahat 2010 main rajya sarkaar ne do jilon main enarasi kii payalat pariyojnaayen shuru kin
 But as members of a minority student group blocked the process by resorting to violence, the project was scrapped
 janvari 2009 main, iity-khadipur ke purv chaatr rahe gogoi ne matadaata suchi main se 41 lakh 'avaidh matadaataaon' ko hataane kii maang ke liye supreme court main janhit yachika daayar karne ke liye udhyami se saamaajik kaaryakarta bane sarama se sampark kiya
 On July 20, 2008, a case was filed in the Supreme Court
 lekin yachikakartaon ne adaalat se apil kii ki vah enarasi ko adhyatan karne kii prakriya par swayan najar rakhe, jo matadaata suchi kii safai ke liye ek aavashyak shart thi
 On April 2, 2013, the case was held by Justice Ranjan Gogoi and H
K
 el
 Reached the bench of Gokhale
 kaam may, 2015 main shuru hua or nyaayalay ne enarasi ke pehle masaude ke prakaashan kii taarikh ke taur par 31 disambar, 2017 kii taarikh tay kii
 "this type of work requires dedication, honesty and courage," says Gogoi, who stays away from the media
 isliye maine sarama se sampark kiya tha
 He wrote the draft of the first petition and applied his money for a legal battle
 san 2000 main 36 kaarobaariyon kii ore se sthapit unka gaiyr-sarkari sanghathan assam public vaksr (apidblyoo) is abhiyaan kaa cheharaa ban gaya
 Sarma says this time, "the first battle of APW was against ULFA
" 2008 ke baad hamane avaidh ghuspaithiyon ke mudde ko uthaaya
 But Sarma's fight is not over yet
 enarasi kaa vartmaan apadet assam samjhaute ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he, jisane kisi ko bhi avaidh ghuspaithiya ghoshit karne ke liye 1971 ko cat-of varsh ke rup main sweekaar kiya tha
 In December 2012, Matiur Rahman, President of the Assam Consolidated Federation, through a writ petition in the Supreme Court, sought to cut the cut-off year to 1950
 is maang ko aresas or assam ke vitt mantri hemanth biswa sarama kaa bhi samarthan hasil he
 If the court decides in favor of Rahman's petition, the process of updating the NRC will be invalid
 pyaaj kii keemton main ijaphe se aam aadmi par mahangaai kaa boj badhane ko koi mudda maanane se hi inkaar karte hue bijepi ke kisaan morche ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh pasha patel ne yah kahkar nayaa vivaad khadaa kar diya ki agar koi vyakti maheene bhar pyaaj nahin khaayegaa, to vah mar nahin jaayegaa
 Patel said during a press conference, 'onion price rise is not an issue
 lekin ise mudda banaakar janata ko gumraah kiya ja rahaa he
 i condemn it
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘ek maheene pyaaj nahin khaane se koi vyakti nahin maregaa
 But a person will definitely die by not eating grains
 patel ne pyaaj ko apane mutabik paribhaashit karte hue kaha, ‘pyaaj pet bharne kii cheez nahin he
 It is a thing to change the taste of the tongue
 ’ maharashtra se taalluk rakhane vaale varisht bijepi netaa ne kaha, ‘aisa kaha jaataa he ki pyaaj nahin khaanaa acchhee baat he
 If a good man eats more onions, he messes up
 yah (pyaaj) acchhee cheez nahin he or jo cheez acchhee nahin he, us par itnaa bavaal machaana thik nahin he
 Patel did not stop here
 unhone daawa kiya, ‘hamaare maharashtra main hindu dharamshastra ke anusaar kaha jaataa he ki pavitra shravan maas main pyaaj nahin khaanaa chaiye
 The senior BJP leader also claimed that onion prices were increased not by farmers but by 'god'
 patel ne kaha, ‘desh ke pramukh pyaaj utpaadak maharashtra main barish nahin hone ke kaaran akaal pad gaya
 People did not even have water to drink, so how did they irrigate onion crops in the fields
 ’ patel ne kaha, ‘pichley paanch-das saal main aisi sthiti aayi he, jab pyaaj kii keemat paanch rupee se badhkar 50 rupee par pahunch gayi he
 But there is no earthquake
 sab kah rahe hai ki pyaaj ke mulya badhane se sari kaum barbaad hone vaali he or log mar jane vaale hai
 there's nothing like this
 ’jab bhaajapa ke kisaan morche ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh se kaha gaya ki dilli ke aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle siyaasi phayda uthaane ke liye unki apni party sasta pyaaj bechati najar aa rahi he, to unhone kaha, ‘main pyaaj ke mulya badhane par raajnneeti kii baat nahin kar rahaa hum
 i am a farmer
 meraa sirf itnaa kahana he ki is mudde par itnaa bavaal mat machaaiye
 Meanwhile, the Congress, taking advantage of the opportunity, has targeted the BJP over Patel's controversial statement
 madhyapradesh congress ke pravaktaa narendra saluja ne kaha, ‘centre kii congress sarkaar pyaaj kii keemton par lagaam lagane kii koshish kar rahi he
 But Patel's statement proves the fact that bjp's main opposition party has nothing to do with the problems of the common man and is merely political gimmick on the rise in onion prices
 ’ Celebrations of success were widely celebrated in the world, but no one would have celebrated such a celebration as that of North Korea's Supreme Leader Marshall Kim Jong Un
 wo bhi 9 hajaar feet kii oonchai par jwalamukhi ke saamne
 Perhaps Kim Jong is trying to tell those worlds or especially America that the flame is in this volcano as much as its missiles and nuclear bombs
 or vakt padegaa to ye uskaa istemaal bhi karegaa
 Blazing flame ubalata lava
 Everything scorching fire
 zordaar dhamaake
 Embers rain ye kudarat kii tabaahi he
 Now watch the destruction of Kim Jong Un
 newclear bam
 Hydrogen bomb
 chemical bam
 Missile bomb
 top kaa gola
 Gunfire kul milakar ye donon hi tabaahi, insaani sabhyataa ke liye khatarnaak he
 But do you know that these two devastations have a connection among themselves
 china se lagati seemaa main uttar korea kaa ye ilaaka mount pektu kaa ilaaka he
 This highest mountain of the Korean Peninsula, causing havoc by becoming a volcano every hundred or two hundred years
 magar is baar is 2 hajaar 744 meter oonchi pahari par chadhakar uttar korea kaa taanashaahakim jong unne insaani tabaahi kaa jashn banaaya he
 Kim Jong Un climbed the highest mountain in North Korea
 pahaad kii chotii par pahunchakar kim ne manaaya kamyaabi kaa jashn
 This celebration of Kim Jong Un is not to reach the pinnacle of power, but the successful test of a missile reaching America
 desh kii sabase oonchi jagah par chadhakar shaayad kim jong un ne duniya ko ye bataane kii koshish kii ki ab uski pahunch duniya ke kisi bhi hisse tak he
 And unlike his habit, Kim Jong-un has expressed his pleasure by making a video of it
 dekhie kareeb teen hazaar meter oonchi is pahari chadhakar kim jong un ye jashn apni sena ke saath apane dada kim il sung kii murti ke saamne manaaya he
 Kim first paid tribute to her grandfather and then the army paraded in her honor
 or duusari taraf jab akele kisi shahenshaah kii tarah chalata hua nazar aayaa to sena khushi se taaliyaan bajaane lagi
 After this celebration, the army saluted its Supreme Leader Marshall Kim Jong Un
 phir sena ke band ne jaise hi deshbhakti kii dhun bajaai
 The entire mountainous area resonated
 apane supreme leader kii maujuudagi main sena kaa josh dekhte hi ban rahaa tha
 During this time, Kim's face was shining differently the whole time
 shaayad ye hansi apane desh ko or sashast banane kii thi
 The celebration has been ongoing in the country since the successful testing of North Korea's new intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-15
 magar ye pehali baar he jab aisa jashn kareeb teen hazaar meter kii oonchai par manaaya ja rahaa ho wo bhi supreme leader marshall kim jong un kii maujuudagi main
 On this occasion, Gadkad Kim Jong laughed with a laugh as he reached the top of the mountain with a successful test of missiles
 maanon wo kah rahaa ho ki america ab uski jad se baahar nahin
 After this, Kim Jong-un encouraged his army by giving a speech
 apnesupreme liderka bhaashan sunakar sena ke kai adhikari bhavuk ho gaye
 And finally Kim Jong Un swore right here for the destruction of America
 uttar korea ke kim rajvansh or mount pektu ke bahut purana naata he
 It is considered the most sacred place in North Korea
 jab bhi uttar korea kaa koi shaasha apni takat kaa pradarshan karata he to wo is pahari chotii par iskaa shukriya adaa karne bhi aata he
 It is not the first time Kim Jong Un has visited Mount Pektu
 wo pehle bhi yahaan aa chukaa he
 But Kim Jong Un's visit to Mount Pektu is linked to the success of his previous missile test
 america raashtrapati baraak obama ne kaha he ki vah is baat ko lekar katai chintit nahin hai ki bukampagrastjapan ke parmaanu urja sanyantrase parmaanu vikiran hawaii tak pahunch jayega
 Asked about concerns about nuclear radiation reaching US shores, he said, "no, i am convinced about it

 "he said during an interview to Pittsburgh TV" i think we should consider improving nuclear technology and try to address our security concerns
 ’unhone kaha ‘ham lagaataar nigaraanee banaae hue hai, maine ise lekar parmaanu niamak ayog se poocha bhi he
 We are constantly monitoring seismic activity
 ’obama ne kaha ki urja ke sabhi strot puri tarah se surakshit nahin hai
 The US took this lesson from a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico last summer
 urja sachiv stivan chu ne aaj bataaya ki urja vibhaag ne japan ko detector evam vishleshan karne vaale upkarnon sahit ek hawaii maap pranali kshamta dene kaa prastaav diya he, taaki vikiran ke kaaran mitti main hone vaale pradooshan kaa aankalan kiya ja sake
 Apart from this, a 34-member team of the department has also proposed to be sent there
 white house ke press sachiv je kaarne ne bataaya ‘hamane aapadaa maamalon se jude visheshgy, raahat or bachaav dal, takanic salaahkaar or parmaanu visheshgy vahaan bhejne ke alaava america kii ore se sainya sahaayta muhaiyaa karaane kaa prastaav bhi diya he

 The decision of who should be given the responsibility of the state president of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Rajasthan has never been easier for the BJP in the last 20 years
 saal 2018 main jin paristhitiyon main madan laal saini bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh bane the use agar dhyaan main rakhaa jaae to tay mana ja rahaa he ab unke dehanth ke baad ek baar phir party par kabje ko lekar gutbaji dekhne ko mil sakati he
 Since the demise of Madan Lal Saini on Monday, the market of speculation is hot about who will become the BJP state president
 darasal, bijepi main rajasthan main ecchhatra raaj karne vaale bhairo singh shekhavat ko darkinar kar jab vasundhara raaje ko bijepi kaa pradesh adhyaksh banaaya gaya tha tab baari virodh hua tha or us vakt se ab tak yahi silsilaa chal rahaa he
 Whether it is Om Mathur or Arun Chaturvedi or Gulab Chand Kataria, there is a fierce battle every time for the post of BJP state president
 ghamaasan ke baad adhyaksh bane the madan laal sainisaal 2018 main rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav se pehle kendriya mantri gajendra singh kaa naam pradesh adhyaksh pad ke liye aane par tatkaaleen mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje or bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kheme ke bich khinchataan dekhne ko mili thi
 The post of the state president remained vacant for months and eventually Madan Lal Saini was made the state president of the BJP as a comprise candidate
 somvaar (24 june) ko madan laal saini ne dilli ke ames aspataal main ilaaj ke dauraan dam tod diya
 After his death, discussions have started once again for the post of state president
 kise milegi bijepi kii jimmedaari?kaha ja rahaa he ki sangh kaa khemaa amer se vidhayak satish puniya ko pradesh adhyaksh bananaa chahta he
 Chandrasekhar, who is watching the functioning of the organization, is also said to be in favor of Punia
 jabaki purv mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje chaahati hai ki bijepi ke rajyasabha saansad narayan pancharia ko pradesh adhyaksh banaaya jaae
 Panchariya is more or less like Madan Lal Saini who shares an equal relationship between the Sangh, Vasundhara and the party
 rajyavardhan ke naam kii bhi charchajaipur se saansad rajyavardhan singh rathod ko is baar modi cabinet main shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 It is being said that Amit Shah wants to make Rathore the state president
 aise main unke naam kii bhi charchaa joro par he
 Similarly, discussion is going on with Churu MLA Rajendra Rathore but it is being said that BJP will want to give the post of state president only to a person of Sangh background
 rajendra rathod janata dal se aae hai jabaki rajyavardhan singh rathore nae-nae bijepi ke netaa hai
 There is a party in the party that is advocating the appointment of Rajsamand MLA Dia Kumari as the new face and as the leader to challenge Vasundhara Raje
 philhal, ye tamaam kayaas hai
 When Madan Lal Saini was made the state president, the political situation was different
 rajya main bijepi kii sarkaar thi or vasundhara raaje mukhyamantri kii kaman sambhaal rahi thim
 Now the Congress is in power and Ashok Gehlot as the experienced leader is assuming the responsibility of CM, while Sachin Pilot as the young face is holding the post of Deputy CM
 payalat ke paas lambey samay se pradesh congress adhyaksh pad kii bhi jimmedaari he
 In such a situation, whether the BJP in the form of Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore hands over the command of the party to any new and popular face or is the name of some other leader, it is all awaited

 surabhi ne donon ko tamaacha maarane kii dhamkee de di
 Neha Pendse also turned against Surabhi
 darasal, somi ke maa kii juthi kasam khaane ko surabhi rana ne mudda bana liya he
 The feud of the two has increased so much that Surabhi has threatened to slap Somi
 colors ne sho kaa nayaa promo jari kiya he, jisamen donon ladate hue dikh rahi hai
 Saba Khan has also jumped in somi-surabhi's quarrel

 Every relationship starts with love but to maintain that relationship in the same form, it is necessary to keep trying from both the sides
 rishta chaahe jo bhi ho lekin agar use sahejkar nahin rakhaa jaae to achche se achche rishte ko bikharane main der nahin lagati
 When two people meet, very few things are the same between the two
 donon ke bich kai baton par asahmati hoti he or kai baar to unhen ek-duusare ke vyavhaar par gussa bhi aata he lekin saath rahete-rahete ye aadaten khud hi badal jaati hai
 This applies to both sides
 ek ore jahaan ladakon ko ladakiyon kii kuch aadate naapsand hoti hai vahiin ladakiyon ke liye bhi kuch baaten bardaasht ke baahar hoti hai
 Maybe your girlfriend also does not like some things in you but she is unable to tell you
 aise main agar aap main bhi ye aadaten hai to aaj se hi un par dhyaan dena shuru kar dijie:1
 Most girls complain that their boyfriends do not pay attention to them
 unhen shikaayat hoti he ki ladke apni baat bataate vakt unase puure dhyaan kii ummid karte hai lekin jab wo kuch kahati hai to ve dhyaan hi nahin dete hai
 2
 adhiktar ladkiyaan is shikaayat ke saath kudhati rahati hai ki unka saathi un par dhyaan nahin detaa he or zyaadaatar vyast hi rahata he
 He complains that he remains immersed in his work all the time and his work is the most important thing for him
 3
 If you are also one of those men who take all the decisions related to home alone, then let me tell you that girls never like such boys
 ladakiyon ko lagata he ki unka partner unhen kamatar aankata he or khud ko hi sarvshereshth maanata he
 4
 zyaadaatar purush antarang sambandhon ke turant baad so jate hai
 Girls find this habit of boys very bad
 unhen ummid hoti he ki unka partner unke saath kuch der tak pyaar bhari baaten karen
 5
 ye samasya lagbhag har ladki ko hoti he
 She feels that her boyfriend does not appreciate her nor does she value him
 har ladki ummid karti he ki uskaa partner sabake saamne uski tarif kare or use mahatv de

 ) The Sultanate, whether small or big, always worries its king that if something happens to him then who will be his heir or successor? The Supreme Leader of North Korea, Marshal Kim Jong-un, is not untouched by this concern
 duniya se apni paariwarik zindagi ko rahasy banaakar rakhane vaale kim jong un ko bhi barason se yahi chintaa sata rahi thi
 But the news is that now his worries have gone away
 kyonki ab kim jong un ko apana vaaris mil gaya he
 There are many mysteries about North Korea in the world and one of those secrets is the secret of Supreme Leader Marshall Kim Jong-un's family
 duniya ye to jaanati he kikim jong unrii sol ju se saal 2009 main uttar korea kii gaddi par baithne se pehle shaadi kii thi
 But very few people know how many children Kim's Ri Sol Joo has
 dakshin korea kii khufia agency kii report ke mutabik kim jong-un kii patni ri-sol-ju ne apni teesri aulad ko janm diya he
 But this is her third child or the child was still a mystery
 magar ab north korea ke marshall kim se jude is sabase bade rahasy se pardaa uth gaya he
 It is reported that Kim Jong Un has got his heir
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki is saal farvari ke maheene main kim kii patni ri sol ju ne ek bachche ko janm diya he
 She stops appearing in public when Kim Jong Un's wife is pregnant
 or is baar bhi jab 2016 main ri sol ju ne jab saarvajanik kaaryakramon main nikalnaa band kar diya tabhi se kayaas lagaae jane lage the ki wo garbhvatee hai
 But the question is, why is there so much mystery about the Kim family? This secret about the Kim family is not new
 khud kim jong un kii paidaaish ko lekar ab tak ye rahasy he ki wo 1983 main janma tha yaa phir 1984 main
 Also, there is not much information about where and how Kim Jong-un grew and grew up
 khud pehali baar kim jong un sitambar 2010 main apane pita kii maut ke kuch vaqt baad saarvajanik rup se saamne aayaa tha
 The North Korean state media does not always provide much information about the personal life of its leader
 yahi vajah he ki kim jong un ke vaaris ke bare main bhi khabaron ko chupaaya gaya
 Let me tell you that before this heir of Kim Jong Un he has two daughters
 jisamen ek kaa janm 2010 or duusari 2013 main hua tha
 But none of these pictures have been revealed to the world so far
 unka naam bhi duniya ko nahin pataa he
 However, there is a news in foreign media about Kim's elder daughter that her name is Kim Jong Ae
 ye jaankaree bhi tab saamne ai thi jackmarikibasketbaal star denis rodman ne saal 2013 main gardian ko die ek intervyuu main galati se ye jaankaree de di thi
 Dennis Rodman and Kim Jong-un's friendship seems strange
 magar isi dosti kii badaulat hi duniya thodaa bahut hi sahi kim jong un ke bare main jaanati he
 Dennis had described this Supreme Leader of North Korea as a 'good father' and said that his 'family is very beautiful'
 'jo rahasy aaj kim ke parivaar ko lekar bana hua he vaisaa unke pita ke saath bhi tha
 He also kept his family's information secret

 The Aam Aadmi Party has been opposing the central government's decision on demonetisation since day one, for which the party leaders and workers are constantly going among the public

 Many people are not getting money even after putting them in line for hours, people are forced to go to the gurudwara to eat food
 kapil mishrane kaha ki bahut se logon ke paas koi kaam dhandha nahin bachaa he isliye gurudwaron main khaanaa pad rahaa he
 The people doing their business by doing small business are unemployed, because the market is closed due to demonetisation

 ) In response to a question about some opposition parties including Congress demanding an apology from the Prime Minister, the Union Minister said, "why should the Prime Minister apologize?" Should they apologize because Dhankuber of black money has become a pauper? Should the Prime Minister apologize because this campaign against black money is going to benefit the poor and common people
 unhone kaha ki congress pradhanmantri se maafee maangane kii maang kar rahi he
 We asked him why the Prime Minister should apologize? Because unscrupulous people are being divided? Or because the blockade and loot lobby of the scam guru gurls have been locked? The Congress and some of its allies are well aware of the fact that whatever the Prime Minister Modi is doing, the biggest benefit will be for the poor, middle class and weaker sections which had been neglected till now

 ) The saint and the Mahanta held a conference on Saturday to pressurize the government regarding the construction of Ram temple in Adhyodhya
 lekin wo ramamandir ke liye sarkaar ko kosne kii bajaay sur main sur milaate najar aa rahe hai
 At the same time, Shiv Sena is also getting ready to follow Modi on the issue of Ram temple
 inhi sawaalon ke chalate ajtak ne ramvilas vedanti se baat kii
 Ramvilas Vedanti, who always raised the ultimatum flag for the Ram temple, who is also a member of the Ram Mandir Trust, told Aaj Tak that sections 370 and 35A are on our agenda before the construction of the Ram temple
 unhone aage kaha ki iske hatane ke baad ramamandir banegaa or 2024 ke pehle iskaa nirmaan kaary shuru ho jayega
 Acharya Rambhadracharya, the elder saint of Chitrakoot, said that he was sure that the construction of the Ram temple would begin in the next 1 year
 shivasena ke bhi badale suraiske alaava shivasena ke bade netaa or saansad sanjay raaoot ne ayodhya main ajtak se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki "2024 ke chunaav main ramamandir kaa mudda khatm ho chukaa hoga or modi or yogi hi mandir banaaenge or shivasena unke kafile main saath hogi
 "when Acharya Dharmendra, who came to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad's Sant Sammelan, started cursing Prime Minister Modi on the stipend of 5 crore Muslim students and the Modi government's plan to get Muslim girls married, the saints and Mahants sitting on the stage at the Sant Sammelan started getting uncomfortable
 Some interrupted
 kuch ke haav bhav bataa rahe the ki narendra modi kii aalochana sunne ke liye sant samaaj taiyaar nahin he
 As soon as Acharya Dharmendra finished his speech, other saints started building bridges of praise to the Modi government and Prime Minister Modi, causing Acharya Dharmendra to leave the stage
 darasal vaqt badal chukaa he
 The Modi government is in a greater majority than last time and the words Prachanda and Bahubali are being used for the Modi government, this victory has changed the meaning of the temple movement
 modi sarkaar ko apane pichley kaarykaal main bahumat hone ke baavjood ramamandir ke liye har manch se aalochana sunani padi thi
 There was no forum of the saint community that did not receive any warning and threat to the Modi government
 lekin duusari baar pradhanmantri pad sambhalate hi un tamaam logon ke sur badal gaye hai, jo lagaataar mandir mudde par modi or yogi sarkaar ko dhamkaate or koste rahe
 But now they are not only listening to the government but are also ready to wait till the court's decision
 in santon or mahanton kii maane to modi sarkaar ko adaalat ke faisle tak kaa vakt diya janaa chahie kyonki modi he to mumkin he or modi hai to mandir bhi banegaa, ye aam raay aam-santon mahanton ke bich lagbhag ban chuki he
 Changes have been made Saksha Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has come to Ayodhya twice in the last 6 months and both times are completely different
 pichhali baar november main jab uddhav thakare aae the to mandir par modi sarkaar ko ultimatum dekar gaye the
 This time when he has come, he has promised to follow this temple issue together
 isse saaf he ki vakt badal chukaa he
 Whether the saints associated with the temple or political parties like Shiv Sena have all understood that this time the people did not vote in the name of the temple, nor did the Modi government put forward the issue of the temple and asked for votes
 aise main ab jabaki prachand jeet ke saath piem modi sarkaar main hai to in sadhu-santon or siyasatdanon ke liye bhi modi kii line par chalanaa ab majaburi ban chukaa he kyonki inhen maaloom he ki dhamkee or ultimatum kaa asar na to sarkaar par padane vaala he or naa hi janata par
 Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Maurya also made it very clear to the saints on Saturday from the platform of the Sant Sammelan in Ayodhya that the government is currently looking at both the court's verdict and the mediation effort
 agar ye donon vikalp fail hote hai tabhi kanoon yaa ordinance kaa koi vikalp saamne aayega
 That is, now it is clear that we will have to wait at the temple and for this, whether it is a saint community or a Shiv Sena, both of them are happy

 However, he did not tell the court how his heart suddenly changed

 During lashkar-e-taiba's plan to carry out these attacks, Headley had spent months searching for the places to be attacked
 hedli ne kaha tha ki usne hamalon ke dauraan jo bhi kiya, usase use gaurav mahasoos hua tha
 Headley said that those who knew that he was involved in the planning of the attacks had sent him congratulatory messages after the attacks

 That is why India did not get a chance to qualify in the next round
 ’’ He said, "but now, they have rejected our opposition
