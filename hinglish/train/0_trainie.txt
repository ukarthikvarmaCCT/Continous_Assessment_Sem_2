 maharashtra ke vidarbha kii bhandara-gondia loksabhaa seat par har chunaav main raajnneetik sameekaran badal jate hai
 Nana Patole won on the BJP ticket from here in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, defeating the Nationalist Congress (NCP) veteran leader and former Union Minister Praful Patel
 lekin party alaakaman se naaraazgi ke chalate naanaa patole ne party se istifa de diya tha
 After his resignation, Madhukar Rao Kukde of the Nationalist Congress (NCP) won the by-election held here
 unhone bijepi ke hemanth patel ko haraaya
 At the same time, now that Nana Patole has resigned and joined the Congress, the tussle over 2019 candidacy will be seen in the upcoming election
 kya rahaa he bhandara-gondia loksabhaa seat kaa itihaas
 
 
 The bhandar-gondia Lok Sabha seat first came into existence in 2008 after delimitation
 isse pehle is loksabhaa seat kaa naam bhandara tha
 But now this seat falls in two districts Bhandara and Gondia and 3-3 assembly seats of both the districts fall under this Lok Sabha
 parisemen ke pehle tak 1999 or 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main yahaan se bijepi ne jeet darj kii
 Chunnilal Thakur won from here in 1999 and Shishupal Patle in 2004
 haalanki, parisemen ke baad yahaan 2009 main baaji palat gai
 NCP candidate Praful Patel defeated Baji Mari and his rival Independent candidate Nana Patole
 dilachasp baat yah he ki 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main nirdaleey ummidavaar hone ke baavjood naanaa patole yahaan duusare sthaan par rahe jabaki bijepi ke shishupal tisare sthaan par rahe
 Seeing Nana Patole's hold in this area, the next election i
e
 in 2014, the BJP gave him a Lok Sabha ticket and he won and also reached Parliament
 haalanki, party alaakaman se matbhed ke baad unhone istifa de diya
 The Bhandara Lok Sabha seat was once a Congress stronghold
 
 
 1952 main hue pehle aam chunaav main bhandara se congress ke tulaaraam saakhre arakshit (anusuchit jati) varg se chune gaye the, to vahiin khule pravarg se congress ke chaturbhuj jasaani loksabhaa pahunche
 In the second general election held in 1957, Balakrishna Wasnik of the Congress from Bhandara was elected to the Lok Sabha from the reserved category
 jabaki baalkrishna vaasanic mahaj 27 saal kii aayu main loksabhaa ke liye nirvaachit hue the
 At the same time, Ramchandra Hazarnavis of the Congress won from the open category
 wo 1962 ke chunaav main bhi dobaaraa chunaav jeetne main safal rahe the
 Then in 1967 A
 of Congress aar mehta, 1971 main vishambhardaas jwalaprasad dube jite, 1977 main congress ke haath se yah seat nikal gai or lakshmanarav maanakar bhartiya lok dal kii tikat par jite
 But this victory did not last long
 1979 main dobaaraa congress jiti
 Keshav Rao Pardhi was elected on a Congress ticket
 wo 1984 main dobaaraa jeet darj karne main safal rahe
 When the rise of BJP happened
 
 
 congress ke dabadabe ke baavjood 1989 main kushal bope ne bijepi ko bhandara loksabhaa seat se jeet dilwaai
 This was bjp's rise to Bhandara seat
 haalanki, 1991 main congress kii tikat se prafull patel jite
 He reached the Lok Sabha from here by winning elections in 1996, 1998 continuously
 1999 main bijepi ne yahaan dobaaraa jeet darj kii chunnilaal thakur saansad bane
 In its next election, the BJP managed to retain its dominance and Shishupal was elected on a BJP ticket in 2004
 kya he vidhansabha siton kaa haal
 
 
 a total of six assemblies fall under the bhandara-gondia Lok Sabha seat
 isamen tumsar, bhandara, saccoli, arjuni morgaanv, tiroda bijepi ke paas he jabaki gondia congress ke paas he
 However, the bjp's dominance in the recently held Lok Sabha by-election did not do much magic here

 An Indian fan named Meena was present at the ball stadium
 iskaa live video stadium kii screen par bhi dikhaaya gaya
 On the basis of Team India batsman Virat Kohli's century innings and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni's 99-run innings, the hosts in Nagpur have slightly managed their position on the third day of the Test match against England
 tisare din khel khatm hone tak bharat ne pehali pari main 297 ranon tak aath wicket ganvaa die hai
 England are still 33 runs ahead on the basis of first innings
 tisare din dhoni or kohli ne milakar team ko sankat se ubaara lekin mejabaan team ne chaar wicket 28 ran ke andar ganvaa diye, jisase uski pehali pari main badhat lene kii ummid kam hi he
 Dhoni and Kohli showed an amazing spirit, sharing 198 runs for the fifth wicket, which is also India's biggest partnership in the series so far
 dhoni or kohli kii paanchaven wicket kii jodi match ke duusare din jab maidan par khilne utari thi tab bhartiya team 71 ran par chaar wicket ganvaakar jujh rahi thi or in donon ne apane wicket bachaakar rakhte hue chaar wicket par 87 ran tak pahunchaaya tha
 On the third day too, both of them returned brilliantly from the century partnership with great courage and did not let any wickets fall in the first two seasons
 ek samay aisa lag rahaa tha ki ye donon team ko pehali pari main badhat dilaa denge, lekin dhimi rangati ke kaaran yah nahin ho sakaa
 The team added 210 runs for the entire day on the third day
 antim satr main chaar wicket 28 ran ke andar gire, kohli or aal rounder rabindra jadeja (12) pagabaadha out tathaa piyush chawla (01) bold hue jabaki dhoni kaa ran out hona niraashajanak rahaa kyonki ran lene ke chakkar main vah apane chathe test shatak se ek ran se chook gayi
 r Ashwin is playing seven runs
 england ke of spinner greem swaan ne tisare din kohli or chawla ke wicket se kul teen jabaki tej gendbaaj james anderson ne jadeja ke wicket se abhi tak chaar wicket apni jholii main daal liye
 Twenty-four-year-old Kohli completed his third Test century by hitting a four off Swan
 isamen unhone 289 gend main 11 chauke jamaaye
 However, he could add three runs in his innings that he was lbw to Swann
 is tarah 84
 The fifth-wicket partnership of 198 runs in 3 overs came to an end with the England team feeling quite relieved
 dhoni ne test maichon main pehali baar 200 se zyada (246) gendon kaa saamana kiya he
 Although it took him more than an hour to score 90 to 99, it was disappointing for the Indian captain to miss a run due to run out
 unhone aath chauke or ek chakke se 99 ran banaaye
 Till tea, the Indian team was moving in the right direction to get the first innings lead by scoring 227 for four from the fifties innings of Dhoni and Kohli, but losing four wickets in the end was not good for the team
 bharat ko yah siries 2-2 se baraabar karne ke liye is mukaable main jeet kii jarurat he
 After lunch, the new ball was taken after 81 overs, Dhoni and Kohli became a bit aggressive
 kohli ne jamatha main visie stadium main tim bresanan or monti panesar par khubasurat cover drive lagaayi
 Both of them scored 81 runs in 27 overs in the second season
 kohli ko lunch ke baad ardhashatak banane ke liye chaar ran kii jarurat thi or unhone panesar kii gend ko extra cover main simarekha paar karakar ise puraa kiya
 Kohli, who spent three hours at the crease scoring 50 runs in 171 balls with just four fours, kept his natural aggression at bay as the team needed it, although he was a bit aggressive after a while
 is aakraamakata kii badaulat vah apana teesraa test shatak puraa karne or farm main vaapasi karne main safal rahe
 This was his reply to hundreds of critics who questioned his commitment, saying that he gave his wicket in the series
 dhoni ne bresanan kii gend par squaire cat par chaukaa jamaakar apana ardhashatak puraa kiya
 He scored 50 runs in 137 balls with the help of seven fours
 dhoni or kohli ne dhime wicket par english gendbaaji akraman kaa datakar saamana kiya
 Kohli, the great shot of the day, collected from Bresnan's ball, distributing the cover and extra cover to the fielders
 swaan jab naye spel ke liye aaye to dhoni ne is of spinner kaa swaagat unki gend par long aan par apni pari kaa pehla chakka jamaakar kiya
 After this, both these batsmen completed 200 runs to India, playing at the crease six hours 15 minutes in the 93rd over
 bresanan ne chaay ke brake se pehle dhoni ko pareshaan kiya or out karne kii unki do apil bhi ampire rad turnar ne khaarij kar di
 Between these two appeals, this fast bowler could not even catch the return catch of Dhoni when the Indian captain was playing for 72 runs
 kohli ke 269 ran ke score par swaan kii gend par pagabaadha out hote hi ran gati bhi dhimi ho gayi
 Jadeja scored 12 runs off 31 balls with two fours and was lbw to Anderson
 iske baad dhoni 295 ran ke score par ran out hokar pavilion laute
 Two runs later, Chawla was bowled by England off-spinner Swann

 tippaniyan Let us tell you that in the last March 11, the families of 12 CRPF jawans martyred in the Naxalite attack in Chhattisgarh, actor Akshay Kumar gave a support of nine lakh rupees
 akshay kumaar ne kaha ki maatr dhai maheene ke bheetar ye bevesite bani he or ye unke dream ko puraa hone jaisaa he
 For this, he congratulated the government
 kendriya rigerv police bal yani ki siarpief ke shaury diwas ke maukey par rajnath singh ne kaha ki pichley do teen saalon main maovadiyon ke prabhaav main agar 45% tak kami ai he to iskaa shrey main hamaare in bahadur javaanon ko dena chahta hum
 Praising the soldiers, he said that some people throw stones at our soldiers in Kashmir, but how generous is our soldiers that they save the lives of those who threw these stones in the hour of crisis
 aapako ye bataa den ki pichley 11 march ko chhattisgarh main hue naksali hamale main shahid siarpief ke 12 javaanon ke parijanon ko abhinayta akshay kumaar ne nau-nau lakh rupee kii madad di thi
 Akshay Kumar said that this website has been made within just two and a half months and it is like fulfilling his dream
 iske liye unhone sarkaar ko badhai di he
 On the occasion of the crpf's Shaurya Divas, Rajnath Singh said that in the last two-three years, if the influence of Maoists has decreased by 45%, i would like to give credit to these brave soldiers of ours

 ISRO explained the difficulties of the Chandrayaan-2 mission
 isamen bataaya tha ki bhartiya vaigyanik chandrayan-2 ko launch karne ke baad use chand par land karaane tak saat tarah kii samasyaon se rubaru hone vaale hai
 However, Chandrayaan-2 has penetrated 4 of the seven Chakravyuhas of space, now only 3 are left
 7 sitambar ko chand kii sataha par utarate hi isro kaa vikram lander or pragyan rover antariksh main aane vaali sabhi samasyaon ke chakravyuuh ko tod degaa
 The skill of ISRO scientists and the technology of Chandrayaan-2 is going to raise the name and honor of the country on 7 September

 com / mpmyc6vpgn— ISRO (@isro)june 3, 2019antariksh kii samasyaon ke ye 4 chakravyuuh bhed chukaa he chandrayanapahala chakravyuuhah sateek raste par le janalaunch ke samay dharti se chand kii duuri kareeb 3 lakh 84 hajaar 400 kimi thi
 The most important route for such a long journey was to choose the trajectory
 kyonki sahi tregectory se chandrayan-2 ko dharti, chand or raste main aane vaali anya vastuon kii gravity, saura vikiran or chand ke ghoomane kii gati kaa kam asar padegaa
 Chandrayaan-2 has successfully penetrated the first Chakravyuh crossing
 doosraa chakravyuuhah gahare antariksh main sanchardharti se zyada duuri hone kii vajah se radio signal deree se pahunchane kii ashanka thi
 But all the communication systems of Chandrayaan-2 are working correctly
 vah bich-bich main apni sehat ke bare main sandesh detaa rahata he
 This Chakravyuh has also penetrated Chandrayaan-2
 teesraa chakravyuuhah chand kii kaksha main pahunchanaachandrayan-2 ko chand kii kaksha main pahunchaana aasaan nahin tha
 But, despite the constantly changing orbital movement by ISRO scientists, Chandrayaan-2 had reached the moon's orbit on 20 August
 yah karne main vaigyanikon itani sateekta dikhaai ki kam eendhan main hi yah kaam puraa ho gaya
 The third Chakravyuh also made the distinction of Chandrayaan-2
 chand par utarane ko taiyaar chandrayan-2, shubhakamanaayen dene ke liye yahaan karen clikachauthaa chakravyuuhah chand kii kaksha main ghoomanachandrayan-2 ke liye chand ke chaaron taraf chakkar lagaana bhi aasaan nahin he
 The big reason for this is that the gravity around the moon is not equal
 isse chandrayan-2 ke electronics par asar padataa he
 But, both Chandrayaan-2's Orbiter and Vikram Lander are circling around the moon efficiently
 chauthaa chakravyuuh bhi chandrayan-2 ne tod daalaa
 Now all these 3 cycles are yet to be broken
 
 
 paanchvaan chakravyuuhah chand kii sataha par soft landingisro vaigyanikon ke mutabik chandramaa par chandrayan-2 ke rover or lander kii soft landing sabase badi chunauti he
 Propulsion systems and onboard computers will be the main task to comfortably land the rover and lander at the South Pole from the Moon's orbit
 ye sabhi kaam automaticali honge
 This is the cycle for which ISRO scientists have stopped breathing, but their eyes are alert and mind alert
 chatha chakravyuuhah landing ke samay chand se udne vaali dhulchand kii sataha par dheron gadde, pathar or dhul he
 As soon as the lander turns on its propulsion system on the lunar surface, there will be rapid dust blowing
 dhul udakar lander ke solar panel par jamaa ho sakati he, isse power supplai baadhit ho sakati he
 Onboard computer sensors may be affected
 halaki, isro vaigyanikon ne is chakravyuuh ko bhedane ke liye sari taiyaari kar lee he
 The solution has been discovered that after reaching a height of 6 meters at the time of landing, only one engine will be kept running instead of five
 taaki dhul udakar dur chali jaae
 Seventh Chakravyuh: a day or night of changing temperature on the surface of the moon is equal to 14 days of the Earth
 isaki vajah se chand kii sataha par taapmaana teji se badalata he
 This will hamper the work of Lander and Rover
 lekin, isro vaigyanikon ko ummid he ki rover or lander donon hi chand ke taapmaana ko aaraam se jhel lenge

 In this atmosphere of fun, when people around you are drinking alcohol, then you should avoid doing anything like this
 3
 It is very important that you look beautiful on your wedding day, but do not think that the more makeup you make, the more beautiful you will look
 bahut adhik mechap lagane se aap sundar nahin balki ajeeb jarur lagengi
 4
 shaadi ek lambii prakriya he
 In which you need to maintain your patience

 Despite this, both the parties parted ways and both the parties put their candidates face-to-face in many seats in this election

 The destruction of Kim's weapons, cannons, missiles and nuclear bombs is not a total havoc in the world, which is not in the hands of dictator Marshall Kim Jong Un
 north koriake tahkhaane hathiyaaron se ate pade hai
 But still this is a hunger for weapons that does not go away
 ab bhi kim jong un kaa mulk mixilon ke pareekshan se duniya ko dahala rahaa he

 lihaaza south korea ko dar sirf kim jong un kii mixilon se nahin balki un khufia sajishon se he, jo north korea ab se nahin balki korea ke do tukade hone ke baad se hi lagaataar karata rahaa he
 Even if the border of Suranganarth and South Korea is not fired on the enemy country like india-pakistan border, this world's most dangerous border has been witness to many terrible conspiracies
 north korea apane padosi mulk par kabza karne ke liye zamin ke andar hi andar saazish rachataa rahata he
 The stories of North Korea's conspiracies lie in the form of tunnels on the border of South Korea
 ek do nahin chaar chaar surangon ke jariye alag alag vakt par north korea ne border ke neeche se south korea ke andar tak rasta bana liya tha
 Taunting the big conspiracy, Korea had started efforts to capture South Korea since the Korean War
 1978 main north korea kii sabase badi surang pakadi gai
 When South Korea came to know about this tunnel, the ground had slipped under its feet, because this third tunnel of North Korea was so big, that not only the train could be run in it, but through this tunnel, 30 thousand soldiers could get one In the hour you could reach Seoul, the capital of South Korea
 border par to donon deshon kii fouj tainaat thi hi, lekin saazish kaa taana bana zamin ke andar se bhi buna jaataa rahaa he

 South Korea is threatened by Kim
 South Korea is also threatened because its capital Seoul is just 45 kilometers from the border of North Korea, obviously North Korea does not need a long-range missile

 Yoga Gurubaba Ramdev said that if the BJP wants to return to power, then it should present Chief Minister Narendra Modi as its leader in the next Lok Sabha elections and it should change its priorities
 unhone kaha ki congress apni janvirohi nitiyon ke kaaran satta main nahin laut sakati, lekin bijepi aisa kar sakati he, basharte vah apni praathamiktaayen badal le
 Ramdev said, "if the BJP changes its priorities and thinks of presenting Narendra Modi as its leader in the next Lok Sabha elections, then there is some possibility and space for that

 Ramdev said that today the country is facing leadership crisis and people are looking towards individuals instead of political parties to bring positive changes in politics
 yoga guru ne kaha, ‘hamaara maananaa he ki yah hoga or is disha main loksabhaa chunaav nirnaayak honge
 He alleged that the government could not take the issue of corruption and black money to its logical conclusion

 In today's political phase, for the country's independence, who embraced the hanging noose, he is also being awarded derogatory remarks
 maamla tab or gambhir ho jaataa he, jab tippanee karne vaala koi or nahin, balki mahatma gandhi ke padpote hon
 Tushar Gandhi, the great-grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, has allegedly made derogatory remarks against shaheed-e-azam Bhagat Singh
 is maamle main tushaar gandhi ke khilaaf jalandhar police ne ravivaar ko maamla darj kar liya he or isaki jaanch shuru kar di he
 Inspector of Jalandhar Police and in-charge of Division Number Eight, Bimalakant said, 'based on the statement of Kishan Lal Sharma, chairman of NGO Jan Jagriti Manch and resident of Jalandhar, Kishan Lal Sharma, Section 295A of Indian Penal Code (injury to Faith against Police Netushar Gandhi) )

 un logon ne aarope lagaaya tha ki tushaar ne bhagat singh ke khilayepamanjanak tippaneeki he
 Earlier, the vice president of the forum, Ashok Sarin told, "in Jaipur, Tusshar Gandhi, in an interview to the media, had accused shaheed-e-azambhagat Singh of English rule
 iske saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki isi kaaran se baapu (mahatma gandhi) ne unki sajaa maaf karne ke liye angreji sarkaar se pairvi nahin kii thi
 '- input language england ke khilaaf shuruaati do test ke liye ghoshit kii gai bhartiya team main jahaan gautam gambhir, karun nair or jayant yadav apana sthaan barkaraar rakhane main safal rahe hai, vahiin harfanmaulaa hardik pandya team kaa nayaa cheharaa hai
 Shikhar Dhawan, KL Rahul and Rohit Sharma have not been able to make it to the team due to injury, while Ishant Sharma has been able to return to the team after recovering from Chikungunya
 hardik pandya ke lihaaj se baat karen to gujarat ke is yuva ko tii20 or vanade ke apane shandaar pradarshan kaa inaam test team main sthaan ke rup main mila he
 Anyway, Team India's fast bowler allrounder has been vacant for a long time
 ek samay irfan pathan is sthaan par makul baithte the lekin girte pradarshan or chongrast hone ke chalate unhen team se baahar hona padaa
 Meanwhile, the team management tried players like Stuart Binny for this particular position but Binny proved too mediocre in terms of fast bowling (?)
 ummid he ki hardik pandya harfanmaulaa ke slot ke liye acha vikalp sabit honge
 The special thing in Hardik's favor is that he throws balls at a speed of around 140 km and is also able to bounce him
 kshetrarakshan main bhi ve maahir hai or ballebaaji bhi acchhee kar lete hai
 However, they have to change their style of batting style of T20 and ODI
 hardik ke paksh main sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki unki umr mahaj 23 saal he or yadi ve test main alrounder ke role main feet baithe to bhartiya cricket ko lambey samay tak seva dene main safal rahenge
 The comments apane ek saal ke kam samay ke international kariyar main hardik ne mahendra singh dhoni or sunil gavaskar jaise diggajon ko khaasaa prabhavit kiya he
 Dhoni, the captain of the ODI team, considers Hardik's talent so special that in this player's debut match, he landed Pandya for bowling with Umesh Yadav in the beginning
 team india ke purv captain sunil gavaskar bhi maanate hai ki pandya main pehle se bahut sudhaar aayaa he or isliye unase badi ummiden kii ja sakati hai
 Speaking to NDTV, former captain Sunil Gavaskar said that 'pandya seems to be filling the lack of a fast bowler all-rounder
 jab nai kamyaabi milti he to aksar khilaadi bhatak jate hai, lekin lagaataar acchhee gendbaazi kar rahe hai
 His focus is visible
 ' ummid kii janaa chahie ki sani ke in shabdon ko hardik test match main bhi sahi sabit karenge
 
 
 In terms of Hardik Pandya, this young Gujarat man has been rewarded for his great performance in T20 and ODI as a place in the Test team
 vaise bhi team india ke fast bowler alrounder kaa sthaan lambey samay se khaali he
 At one time, Irfan Pathan used to sit at this place but due to the falling performance and injury, he had to leave the team
 is bich team prabandhan ne stuart binni jaise khilaadiyon ko is khaas sthaan ke liye aajamaaya lekin binni tej gendbaaji (?) ke lihaaj se behad saadhaaran sabit hue
 It is expected that Hardik Pandya will prove to be a good choice for the all-rounder's slot
 hardik ke paksh main khaas baat yah he ki ve 140 kimi ke aasapaas kii gati se genden phenkate hai or is kaaran unhen oochaal dene main bhi sakasham hote hai
 He also specializes in fielding and does well in batting
 haalanki tii20 or vanade kii kii style kii batting ke apane style main unhen badlaav laana hoga
 The most important thing in Hardik's favor is that he is just 23 years old and if he fits in the role of all-rounder in the Test, then he will be able to serve Indian cricket for a long time
 tippaniyan In his short one-year international career, Hardik has impressed the likes of Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Sunil Gavaskar
 vanade team ke captain dhoni to hardik kii pratibha ko itnaa khaas maanate hai ki is khilaadi ke debyue match main hi unhone pandya ko umesh yadav ke saath shuruyaat main gendbaaji ke liye utaar diya
 Former Team India captain Sunil Gavaskar also believes that there has been a lot of improvement in Pandya and hence great expectations can be expected from him
 NDTV se baat karte hue purv captain sunil gavaskar ne kaha tha ki 'pandya ek fost bowler olerounder kii kami ko puraa karte nazar aate hai
 When new breakthroughs are found, players often go astray, but are consistently bowling well
 unka fokas nazar aata he
 It is to be hoped that the words of Sunny will prove them right in a hearty test match

 Amid political turmoil over the Rafael Faraldaku plane deal between France and India, the BJP has alleged that the Congress wants to back the company of Sanjay Bhandari, close to Gandhi Vadar's son-in-law Robert Vadra, by canceling the deal
 darasal rafel vimaan banane vaali companydsose jab mukesh ambani kii company reliance arospes technology limited (RATL) ne is deal se khud ko alag kar liya tab sanjay bhandari kii vivaadit company offsets india salution (OIS) ne daso se ofaset niyamon ke tahat sauda karne ke liye baatcheet kii thi
 The main allegation of the Congress regarding the Rafale deal is centered on the offset agreement between Anil Ambani and Dassau by canceling the deal with state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL)
 congress ke is aarope ko france ke purv raashtrapati fransava oland ke haalia bayaan se or bal mila he
 What is the offset rule? The offset rule in defense procurement was first introduced in 2005 under the Manmohan government's Defense Procurement Procedure (DPP)
 iske tahat kisi videshi company ko saude kaa ek hissaa bharat main nivesh karnaa hota he
 The 50 percent offset clause was part of the original tender in the 126 Rafale aircraft deal
 is niyam ke tahat daso ke paas kisi nijee company ko chunane kii chhot thi, basharte mukhya production line sarkari company hindustan eronautics limited (HAL) kii ore se taiyaar kii jaae
 Under the initial deal of 126 Jet, the French company was to invest Rs 1,07,415 crore as an offset in India
 lekin francisi raashtrapati francwa oland or pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 36 rafel vimaanon kii sidhi kharid kaa faisla liya
 After which, on behalf of France, it is said that when it is supplying aircraft at the same rate at which the Air Force is buying, the condition of 50 percent offset clause does not apply
 jaane rafel deal main upie or endie ke dauraan hue ofaset kararbharat ke medium multi role combat aircraft (MMRCA) ke saude ke liye daso ne apane rafel jet ko 28 agast, 2007 ko maidan main utaara tha
 At that time Dassault started negotiations with the Tata group for a private partnership in India
 darasal daso ko bharat main aisi majboot company kii talash thi jo bade paimaane par order le sake
 But after the Tata group's decision to choose an American partner, Dassault started talks with Mukesh Ambani with Reliance
 is samay reliance erospes sector main utarane kii yojana bana rahi thi
 For which a new company Reliance Aerospace Technologies Limited (RATL) was formed on 4 September 2008
 rafel or eurofiter ko vaayu sena kii ore se shortlist kiye jane ke kuch saptaah baad may 2011 main RATL ne saajhedaari kii taiyaari ke maddenjar senior agjicutives kii bhartiyon bhi shuru kar di thi
 In January 2012, when DASO emerged as the lowest-priced company for this deal
 tab sarkaar ne MMRCA ke liye daso ke saath sauda tay kiya
 After that, the price negotiations between Dassau and the Ministry of Defense started
 isamen ofaset plan or HAL ke saath qaraar kii sharten shaamil thim
 The offset plan prepared by DASO included creating a center for composites manufacturing, transfer of critical technology and a joint venture for Falcon Jet, as well as plans to invest in smart cities in the future
 jiske liye mukesh ambani kii RATL ke saath baatcheet chal rahi thi
 But in 2014, Mukesh Ambani's company Reliance Industries (RIL) decided to step out of the business of defense and aerospace
 jis kaaran yah yojana radd ho gai
 In 2014, a tainted company named Offsets India Solutions (OIS) started negotiating with Dassau under offset rules after Mukesh Ambani canceled the deal
 is company ke pramotor sanjay bhandari ke kathith taur par gandhi parivaar ke damaad robert wadra ke saath sampark the
 In 2016, an investigation was conducted in the OIS office in Delhi during an investigation

 The firm has since been almost closed
 2015 menmodi sarkaarne france kii sarkaar ke saath purana sauda radd karte hae 36 rafel vimaanon kii sidhi kharid kaa faisla liya
 Which included Anil Ambani's company as an offset partner
 sarkari company HAL kaa zikr is saude main nahin rahaa
 Now the statement of former French President François Hollande has brought political disturbances in the country, in which he has claimed that the name of Anil Ambani's company was extended from India
 jabaki france kii sarkaar or daso kii taraf se bayaan jari kar kaha gaya he ki ofaset qaraar main sarkaar kaa koi yogadan nahin he or company apni nijee partner chunane ke liye swatantra he

 As a punishment for a dozen such people, they were imprisoned in a jungle vehicle and roamed across the city which is used to catch stray dogs or other animals and leave them out of the city

 34-year-old Maktumhusan from Karnataka was removed from the army citing 'undesirable soldier'
 angreji akhbaar 'da hindu' kii khabar ke mutabik, maktumhussain ke vakeelon ne unhen supreme court jane kii salaah di he
 The case is of 2001
 bataaya jaataa he ki maktumhussain ne apane commanding afasar (sio) se dadhi badhaane ko lekar sweekruti maangi thi
 He emphasized on 'religious grounds' for this
 sio ne shuruyaat main unhen isaki ijaajat bhi di thi, lekin baad main unhen yah ahsaas hua ki niyam ke mutabik dharm ke aadhaar par sirf sikhasainikonko dadhi badhaane kii ijaajat di ja sakati he
 First transferred, then under the show cause notice, the CO later withdrew the permission given to Maktumhusain
 jabaki sainik ne ise 'bhedbhaav' maanate hue karnataka hai court main niyam ke khilaaf apil kii
 It is said that even after this, the soldier did not cut his beard, on which he was transferred to the Command Hospital in Pune
 vahaan nae sio ne bhi maktumhussain se dadhi kaatane ko kaha
 But he stuck to his stubbornness and flatly denied it
 maamle main makhmumhossain ko ek kaaran bataao notice bhi jari kiya gaya, jiske baad unhen anushaasanheenata ke tahat 14 din ke ditension par bhej diya gaya
 According to the information, the jawan disregarded the instructions even after this
 iske baad karrwai karte hue use seva se hataa diya gaya or maamle main jaanch ke baad 'andizayreble soljar' bataaya gaya
 The Air Force removed Ansari in 2008, however, it is not the first time that the Muslim has been removed from the army for shaving
 2008 main indian airforce join karne ke chaar saal baad ansaari aftab ne dadhi rakhane kii anumati maangi thi
 He was not allowed it as per rules, after which Ansari went on a 40-day leave and returned with a beard on duty
 ansaari ko aieef ke niyam na maanane ke liye 2008 main naukari se hataa diya gaya
 a rule in the Air Force also states that two petitions were filed in this direction in the same year
 inamen se ek vayusena ke corporal mohammad jubair ne, jabaki duusari maharashtra ke pulicekarmi mohammad fasi ne daayar kii thi
 Interestingly, the Indian Air Force allows Muslims with beard to have facial hair before 1 January 2002 at the time of enrollment

 Congress came to the government after 15 years in Madhya Pradesh, where the BJP has come up in controversies justifying the role of the police in the Mandsaur firing during the government, while the Congress also gave its answers in the Legislative Assembly case during the Narmada Yatra
 Due to this, former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh is facing resentment
 darasal, congress ne vidhansabha main apane jawaab main mana he ki narmada yatra ke dauraan hue paudharopan main bhaajapa sarkaar dwaara koi bhi gadabadi nahin kii gai he, jabaki paudharopan maamle main ghotaale kii jaanch kii baat congress apane vachan patr main kar chuki he
 Is there really any wrong in the plantation of Narmada during the rule of Shivraj Singh Chauhan? This question is arising because till now this claim was made by the BJP, but now no one else is claiming this by the Congress government itself which came to power after 15 years
 congress sarkaar main vanmantri umang singhar ne vidhansabha main puche gaye prashn ke dauraan mana he ki narmada kinare kiye gaye paudharopan main sarkaar ko kisi bhi tarah kii gadabadi nahin mili he
 As soon as the government's reply came, former Congress Chief Minister Digvijay Singh put the ministers of the government in the dock
 digvijay singh ne kaha ki 'maine khud 6 maheene kii narmada yatra kii he, is dauraan unhen ek bhi paudha nahin dekha aise main vibhaag ke mantri ne kaise maan liya ki koi bhi ghotaalaa nahin hua
 At least he should have read the Congress promissory note
 computer baba bhi naarazdarasal, purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne 11 may 2016 ko narmada seva yatra kii shuruyaat kii thi
 The highly publicized visit of the BJP government ended on 15 May 2017 in Amarkantak
 yatra ke dauraan sarkaar ne daawa kiya tha ki narmada kinare sarkaar ne 6 karod paudhe rope he
 Not only did the Congress object to this claim of the government, but all the saints also warned of the movement, calling it false
 jiske baad sarkaar ne virodh karne vaale paanch santon ko mantri pad saunpa tha
 In the plantation case, the computer baba, who stood in the BJP box, is still claiming that there is a scam in planting saplings along the Narmada
 ab sarkaar ke is jawaab ke baad wo mukhyamantri kamalnath se baat karenge
 Computer Baba said that when i kicked the chair of Minister of State in the Shivraj government, then why will i not raise this issue now
 vanmantri kii safihalanki purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh kii naaraazgi ke baad sarkaar ke vanmantri vidhansabha main die gaye jawaab se palatate najar aae
 Forest minister Singhar said after the all-round attack that he did not give clean chit to anyone but ordered an inquiry into the scam
 vanmantri ne kaha ki unhone vidhansabha main die jawaab main saaf likhaa he ki is maamle kii jaanch ke aadesh die hue hai aise main isapar kisi kaa dhyaan kyon nahi gaya?bijepi ko mila tanj kasne kaa maukacongress ke jawaab se sabase zyada utsahit bijepi najar ai
 After the reply from the government, the BJP now believes that in both the Mandsaur firing case or in both the cases of plantation, the Congress lied to the public to get votes
 haalanki mandsaur golicond or vriksharopan maamle main sarkaar kii kirakiri hote dekh khud mukhyamantri kamalnath ko morcha sanbhaalanaa padaa
 Kamal Nath tweeted, "both these cases are scams and we will punish the accused
" mandsaur golicond or narmada kinare vriksharopan in do maamalon ko lekar congress ne puure chunaav ke dauraan bhaajapa ko aade haathon liya tha
 The promise letter also promised to investigate the cases, but since the answer given in the assembly, questions are arising whether the Congress has changed its attitude after the coming of the government
 aarushi talwaar hatyakand main doctor talwaar or unki patni noopur talwaar ko doshi tehraaya janaa sahi he, aisa aaj tak ke adhisankhya pathakon kaa maananaa he
 We had asked our readers that Drs
 rajesh or noopur talwaar ne hi apni beti aarushi or naukar hemraj kaa katl kiya
 After five and a half years, the court pronounced the verdict
 kya aapako lagata he ki der se hi sahi nyaay hua he?hamaare pathakon main se 60
 5 percent believe that late justice has been done while 39
 5 pratishat ise sahi nahin maanate, yani yah faisla nyaaypurna nahin he
 Our reader s Kumar has written that the Talwar couple are responsible for the death of the daughter and the servant but they have no fault because in such a situation, if anyone would have seen their daughter with someone, they would have done the same
 
 
 ye to duniya kaa sach he
 Khushdeep Rai, a reader, has agreed with him
 surendra kumaar pandeya ne likhaa he ki talwaar danpati ne kaatilon ko pakadvane kaa kam or khud ko bachaane kaa zyada prayaas kiya
 Maheshwari also wrote that this was an angry action
 lokesh ne likhaa he ki aarushi ko uske maa-baap ne hi maaraa he
 Shambhu Kumar Giri, another reader, has justified this
 gopi chand ne likhaa he ki yahaan to nyaay milane main varshon lag jate hai, is maamle main to mahaj 5 saal hi lage hai
 Irfan has supported him
 lekin rajnish ne likhaa he ki abhi lanbaa safar he, unhen hai court se jamaanat mil hi jaaegi
 But there are some readers who do not agree with this decision
 akaash sharma ne likhaa he ki yah sahi nahin he
 Raja Singh has written that this case was made by the CBI to save its credibility
 ashok ne likhaa he ki sibiai ne isamen apni peeth khud hi thapthapai he
 Raj has written that he is being implicated
 sheshdev sahu ne likhaa he ki unhen fansaaya ja rahaa he
 Satya Prakash Singh writes why the media is implicating its leg in this matter
 sanjeev rana ne likhaa he ki sirf sibiai ke closer report par hi faisla de diya gaya, koi saboot to dena chahie tha

 Now, as the Chief Election Agent of Rajnath, he has been given the same responsibility he used to play during Vajpayee's tenure in the April 30 election in Lucknow
 rajnath singh jaanate hai ki lakhanu kii siyasat or vaajapeyi kaa cheharaa ek-duusare ke poorak hai
 On the one hand, if Vajpayee's legacy is being fought in Lucknow, then Congress National President Sonia Gandhi wants to retain her legacy of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by winning the election for the fourth consecutive time in the adjacent parliamentary seat Rae Bareli
 2 april ko raibareli se namakan bharne se pehle sonia us parampara ko nibhaana nahin bhuulin, jisaki shuruyaat indira gandhi ne 1967 main apane pehle sansadeey chunaav main kii thi

 Professor Khan Atif, former chairman of the Persian department at Lucknow University, says, "two factors can stall the path of Rajnath Singh
 brahman ummidavaaron ko chunaav main tavajjo na milane ke kaaran yah tabaka rajnath se bidak saktaa he or brahmanon ke kisi virdohi pratyaashee ke saath jane kii gunjaaish main musalamaanon kaa ekamusth vot bhi iskaa anusaran kar saktaa he
 "congress candidate Rita bahuguna-joshi, who holds 16 per cent of the 16 per cent Brahmin electorate in Lucknow, has challenged Rajnath through the brahmin-muslim equation

 The BJP has fielded lawyer Ajay Aggarwal in the Supreme Court as against Sonia, who came up for discussion by filing a PIL against the CBI action in the Bofors scandal and the Taj Corridor case

 Aggarwal says, "the entire BJP organization stands with me to defeat Sonia in Rae Bareli
 raibareli kii janata is baar modi ko pradhanmantri banane ke liye bijepi ko vot degi
 Priyanka and Pankaj's exams are actually the test of Priyanka Gandhi's experiments in Rae Bareli in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, which have been done in the party's organization in the last two years after the assembly elections

 "the 2014 Lok Sabha elections will also test the skills of Rajnath Singh's son and state BJP general secretary Pankaj Singh
 15 march ko lakhanu se rajnath kii ummidavaari kii ghoshnaa hone ke baad se agle hi din lakhanu pahunch kar pankaj singh chunaav kii taiyaariyon main jute gaye the

 This time the strategy of feeding lotus in Awadh has drawn Rajnath from Ghaziabad to Lucknow
 bijepi ke pradesh pravaktaa chandramohan singh kehete hai, “rajnath ke lakhanu se chunaav ladgaye kaa asar avadh kii 17 siton ke saath purvanchal par bhi padegaa
 This time, it should not be surprising if BJP crosses its record of winning 12 seats in Awadh
 ” lakhanu se rajnath ke chunaav ladgaye kaa asar barabanki, gonda, kaisarganj, shravasti, mohanlalganj, sitapur, unnav jaisi sansadeey siton par saaf padegaa jahaan thakur matadaataaon kii ausatan sankhya 10 pratishat ke kareeb he
 The region of Awadh, which has a special identity for shero-shayari, civilization and culture, has been steadily lagging behind in the race for development over time, while development has become a reference point in today's politics

 In the Rajya Sabha, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh proposed the election of Kurian to the post of Deputy Chairman, which was supported by the Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley
 unke chunaav ke liye vibhinn dalon ke netaaon ne chah prastaav alag se rakhe
 After the proposals were put up, Chairman Mohammad Hamid Ansari announced Kurien's unanimous election
 sabhapati ne courian ko upasabhapati pad par nirvaachit hone par badhai dete hue vishwaas vyakt kiya ki unke do dashak se adhik kaa sansadeey anubhav unhen sadan ko sucharu rup se chalaane main madadgaar sabit hoga
 He said that Kurien has contributed a lot as MP and Union Minister of State
 ansaari ne ummid jataayi ki courian sadan ke sabhi virgon ko saath lekar chalenge
 Prime Minister and Leader of the House Manmohan Singh congratulated Kurien and said that his unanimous election is a reflection of the fact that all members respect him and support him
 unhone kaha ki courian ek kushal saansad or yogya prashaasak rahe hai
 He assured Kurien of full support from the ruling party in running the house smoothly
 vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne courian ko badhai dete hue kaha ki unka sarvasammati se chunaa janaa is baat kii ore sanket karata he ki unka vyaktitv kaaphi khushmijaaj he or unke andar kaaphi dhairya he
 He said that these days it has become rare for any post to be unanimous
 jetali ne kaha ki vah chah baar loksabhaa ke liye chune gaye jabaki rajyasabha main yah unka teesraa kaarykaal he
 He said Kurien did full justice to members of the opposition while he was on the Deputy Chairman's panel
 ab jabaki unki seat vipaksh kii ore hi ho gayi he to hamen puri ummid he ki vah vipaksh ko or mauka denge
 BSP chief Mayawati hoped that Kurien would give ample time to raise issues related to the Dalits and the underprivileged
 unhone saath hi yah bhi suzav diya ki sadan kii kaarywahi chalaate samay chote dalon sahit sabhi kaa dhyaan rakhen
 CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury, wishing him the best, said he had a long experience of parliamentary democracy
 unhone ummid jataayi ki courian satta paksh or vipaksh sahit sabhi dalon kaa dhyaan rakhenge
 Yechury jokingly said that it was to be expected that he would not do so the way he has been using the bell to stop the members when the time is up for discussion
 unhone to yahaan tak suzav de diya ki asana se ghanti ko hi hataa diya janaa chahie
 On this suggestion of the CPI (M) leader, there was a wave of laughter among all the members including Kurien
 jadyu ke shivanand tiwari ne yechuri ke ghanti vaale suzav kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki courian ne apane achche vyavhaar ke kaaran aadar evam sammaan arjeet kiya he
 He also saw Kurien's unanimous election as a rare opportunity

 ncp's Tariq Anwar said that Kurien's unanimous election is a good example of our good parliamentary traditions
 unhone ummid jataayi ki courian puure sadan ko saath lekar chalenge
 He said that Kurien started his political journey from the block level and reached here today
 unhone kaha ki courian ko teen dashak kaa sansadeey anubhav rahaa he or unhen sahakaarita andolan kaa bhi anubhav he

 courian ne sarvasammati se nirvachan ke liye sabhi sadasyon ko dhanyavad diya or bharosa jataayaa ki vah sabhi sadasyon ke sahyog se sadan ko sucharu rup se chalaane kaa prayaas karenge
 He said that he too is not in favor of using the bell but has to do so due to the time limit
 unhone ummid jataayi ki ek shikshak hone ke naate ghanti ke prati unka lagaav swabhaavik he
 However, he said he would try to give all members a chance to express their views
 uttarakhand main hue upachunaav ke parinaam se utsahit congress ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki isse jaahir hota he ki kendra main rajg ke satta main aane ke saath din ke andar hi narendra modi ke myth tut gaya he
 Party Spokesperson PC Chacko told reporters that this result is also important from the perspective that the party has wrested two seats from the BJP while ensuring a good win for Chief Minister Harish Rawat
 chaako ne congress main bharosa jataane ke liye uttarakhand ke logon ko dhanyavad diya
 The Congress, which is going through a difficult phase in various states after the crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, got the good news from Uttarakhand today where the party led by Chief Minister Harish Rawat won all the three seats in the assembly by-elections by defeating the BJP
 dilachasp baat yah rahi ki haal main hue loksabhaa chunaavon main modi lahar ke chalate pradesh kii paanchon loksabhaa siten ganvaane vaali congress ne dharchula ke alaava anya donon vidhansabha siten bhaajapa ke kabje se chhini hai
 In these by-elections, BJP has suffered a setback and due to this the number of its mlas in the state assembly has come down from 30 to 28
 pehle din se hi darshakon ne shivanya yani 'nagin' ko sir-ankhon par baithaaya he
 This innocent and equally dangerous serpent has been topping the TRP charts for several consecutive weeks
 lekin ab jo khabar saamne aa rahi he, vah darshakon kaa dil todane vaali ho sakati he
 It is being said that the first series of this show will end with the death of Shivanya
 haalanki iskausraa sijanlane kii taiyaari abhi se ho chuki he
 Let us know that from this beginning there was a preparation to make 'naagin' for a limited period and it was also planned that it would be introduced on the basis of seasons
 khabar he ki 'nagin' kii is siries kaa ant may main hoga
 And instead, producer Ekta Kapoor's new show 'mangalsutra' will be aired
 vahiin bataaya ja rahaa he ki teenon mukhya kirdaaron yanimauni roy,adaa khan or arjuna bijlani, main se koi bhi next sijan main najar nahin aayega
 The character of the serpent is not known, but there is definitely a discussion about taking Gurmeet Chaudhary in the sequel of Isho
 vaise jis tarah yah sho or iske kirdaar lokapriy ho rahe hai
 And given the ratings it is getting, the new season might be a bit risky for new Castlana producers

 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf andolan ke agle swaroop ko lekar anna hajaare or unki purvavarti team kii buudhvaar ko hui baithak vifal ho gai or hajaare ne team ke tuutane kii aupchaarik ghoshnaa kar di
 After the meeting, Hazare said, 'it is unfortunate that the team has split up
 main kisi party yaa samooh main shaamil nahin hounga
 i will not participate in his campaign
 maine unhen apana photo or naam ke istemaal se manaa kar diya he
 You fight yourself ’gauratlab he ki hajaare or unki purvavarti team ne pichley saal maujuuda sarkaar par yah aarope lagaaya tha ki vah karodon rupee kharch kar unhen todane kii koshish main lagi he lekin bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai ke agle swaroop ko lekar hui baithak main anna kii aguwai vaala ‘team anna’ andolan bikhar gaya
 The first fast against corruption at Jantar Mantar under Anna's leadership took place in April 2011
 kejariwal par hamalaa karte hue hajaare ne kaha ki agar janata kaa baari samarthan raajnneetik dal ke gathan ke paksh main tha to phir buudhvaar ko baithak bulaai hi kyon
 After a meeting that lasted more than nine hours in a closed room, Hazare said that Kejriwal and his path had split
 unhone kejariwal ko nayi party kii shubhakamanaayen di
 He said, 'some people feel that fighting against corruption can be fought by forming a party, but i have been saying beforehand that i will not contest elections and i wish them all the best
 ’hajaare ne india against karpshan dwaara karaae gaye janamat surveykshan ko bhi khaarij kar diya or kaha, ‘mujhe fasebuk, internet ke madhyam se karaae gaye surveykshan par bharosa nahin he
 However, he said, 'it is not to blame for forming a political party and neither is opposition to those contesting elections
 agar unhen lagata he ki unhen sansad main bahumat hasil ho jayega to yah acchhee baat he
 Our paths diverge
 ham donon ne apana alag alag rasta chunaa he
 When he was pointed out that Kejriwal had earlier announced that he would not form the party until Hazare's approval, he said that if that is the case, the party should not be formed
 buudhvaar ko hui baithak main nyaayamurti santosh hegade, shanti bhushan, prashanth bhushan, kiran bedi sahit kuch patrkaar or anya log shaamil hue jisamen ek samooh ne aarope lagaaya ki hajaare kaa kejariwal samooh ne ‘shoshan’ kiya
 In response, other groups said that the people of Delhi have elevated the image of Anna
 buudhvaar ke ke ghatnakram par kejariwal ne twit kiya, ‘desh bik rahaa he
 He is going through a very difficult period
 main apane desh ko bachaane ke liye jo bhi sambhav hoga karuunga
 Kiran Bedi, who is opposed to the formation of a political party, tweeted, 'anna finally distanced herself from the political alternative

 varrier) on Feb 14, 2018 at 8:00am PST After a long wait, the cabinet of the newly elected Kamal Nath government of Madhya Pradesh was finally formed
 navgathit cabinet main kshetreey, jaateey or gutiy pratinidhitiv ke aadhaar par santulan banane kii koshish kii gai he
 In the picture of Kamal Nath cabinet which has emerged, the dominance of malwa-nimar region can be clearly seen among the 28 ministers who took oath
 aisa isliye bhi he ki bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kaa garh rahe is kshetra ko dhaha kar hi congress party rajya kii satta main vaapasi kar pai he
 Chief Minister Kamal Nath, who dominates malwa-neemad in the cabinet, has given all the areas of Madhya Pradesh a place of representation in his cabinet
 lekin sarvaadhik 9 mantri malwa-nimad kshetra se banaae gaye hai
 In the 2013 assembly elections, BJP won 57 of the 66 seats in the region
 lekin is vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi 28 siten hi bachaa pai
 The Congress was able to come close to a majority with the increase in this area
 lihaaja bijepi ke is garh ko aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ko dekhte hue khaasaa mahatv diya gaya he
 The ministers to be formed from Malwa Nimar include Vijay Laxmi Sadho, Sajjan Singh Verma, Hukum Singh Karada, Bala Bachchan, Sachin Yadav, Surendra Singh Baghel, Tulsi Ram Silavat, Umang Singhar and Jeetu Patwari
 malwa-nimad ke baad sabase adhik 6 mantri madhya kshetra se banaae gaye hai
 So there are 5 ministers from gwalior-chambal region
 jabaki mahakaushal kshetra se 4 mantri or bundelkhand se 3 mantri banaae gaye hai
 This time the Congress did not do well in the Vindhya region and Ajay Singh, the Leader of Opposition in the Assembly and son of former Chief Minister Arjun Singh, himself lost the election
 lihaaja vindhyas kshetra se sirf 1 mantri ko hi cabinet main jagah mili he
 Rajputs are most preferred: In the cabinet of Madhya Pradesh, Rajputs have given special preference to the caste equation
 rajput jati se sarvaadhik 8 mantri banaae gaye hai
 At the same time, 5 from Scheduled Castes, 5 from Other Backward Classes, 4 from Scheduled Tribes, 3 Yadavs, 1 Muslim and 2 women mlas have been made ministers
 mantrimandal kaa ekmaatr muslim cheharaa aarif akil bhopal uttar se 6 baar ke vidhayak hai or purv kii congress sarkaar main alpsankhyak kalyaan, gas raahat or punarvaas mantri rah chuke hai
 Talking about women ministers, Vijayalakshmi has chosen from Sadho Maheshwar and has been a Rajya Sabha member and a minister in the past
 saadho nimad kshetra main congress kaa badi mahila cheharaa hai
 At the same time, another woman minister, Imrati Devi, is considered a staunch supporter of MP Jyotiraditya Scindia and is the popular SC face of gwalior-chambal division
 kamalnath-sindhiya-digvijay gut ko baraabar jagahmadhya pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main prachaar ke dauraan aksar yah sawaal uth rahe the ki rajyon main congress teen guton main banty he
 So when the Congress Party government was formed, it was believed that the party might have to face difficulties in satisfying all the factions
 lekin mantrimandal ke drushtikon se is baat kaa khaasaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya ki sabhi guton ko baraabar pratinidhitiv mili
 Perhaps this is why it took so long to finalize the list of ministers
 pradesh kii navgathit cabinet kii baat karen to is mantrimandal main purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh gut ke 9, kamalnath gut ke 9 or jyotiraditya sindhiya gut ke 8 vidhayakon ko mantri banaaya gaya he
 While Omkar Singh Markam (ST), MLA from Dindori, is the choice of Rahul Gandhi
 haalanki in mantriyon kii suchi par aakhri muhar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne hi lagaai
 Cabinet List: 1
 sajjan singh verma (essi):sonkachha se vidhayak verma saansad or kendriya mantri rah chuke hai
 He is considered close to Kamal Nath
 2
 Hukum Singh Karada (OBC): Karada, MLA from Shajapur, is the big face of Congress in Malwa
 purv kii congress sarkaar main urja mantri rah chuke hai
 Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya are considered close to both Sindhis
 3
 Tulsi Silavat (SC): For the fourth time MLA from Sanwar, Silvat has been a minister in the Congress government, is a big SC face of Malwa politics and is considered as Scindia's special friend
 4
 Bala Bachchan (ST): Bachchan, a fifth time MLA from Rajpur, has been the Sports and Youth Welfare, Health Minister in the erstwhile Congress Government
 malwa-nimad main congress kaa bada cheharaa hai or kamalnath ke kareebi maane jate hai
 5
 jitu patawaari (obisi):indore kii rau seat se duusari baar vidhayak bane patawaari malwa ke tej tarraar netaa maane jate hai

 Order of Attendance Necessary Since January, as of now there is no streak in JNU regarding attendance
 lekin pehali baar chaatro kihajiri or gaiyrhaazirika aankalan kiya jayega, or nunatam hajiri ko anivaary karne ke liye kadam uthaaya ja rahaa he
 All the student organizations are opposing this decision of the administration in unison
 chaatr sanghathanon ne faisle kaa waapas lene kii maang kii he
 Students say that such rules cannot be imposed on JNU students
 vahiin JNU main prashasan ne skulon ke dean or sabhi centres ke cheirperson ko kaha he ki sabhi students ke liye atendence jaruri kii jaae
 The Evolution Branch has issued a circular stating that the proposal to mandate attendance was approved at the Academic Council (AC) meeting held on 1 December
 baithak main liye gaye faisle ke aadhaar par winter semester se ise lagu karne ke liye VC ne manjuuri de di he
 But the JNU Students' Union says that no such proposal was approved at the academic council meeting
 prashasan is tarah ke farmaan jari kar JNU campus ke itihaas par hamalaa kar rahaa he
 And it will not be accepted at all
 vahiin ABVP bhi JNUSU ke sur main sur milaate hue prashasan ke is faisle ke khilaaf he
 abvp's student wing termed JNU administration's decision regarding attendance as Tughlaki decree westeindies ke khilaaf match main dhoni ne 54 ran banaae

 It is being described as the trailer of the country's biggest political show i
e
 general elections to be held in the summer of 2019
 hindi pattee ke teen rajyon rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh ke chunaavon ke ird-gird jo rajnatik baaten gadhi ja rahi hai, ve bemaani bhi nahin hai
 The result, which was announced on December 11, barely six months before the Lok Sabha elections, will make it clear how much water the two big national parties of the country - Congress and BJP are in the water
 philhal, bhaajapa teenon rajyon main satta main he or in rajyon kii 65 main 62 loksabhaa siten uske hi khate main hai
 If the ruling party loses in more than one state, it will have to rethink its strategy for the Lok Sabha elections
 in rajyon main haar se bhaajapa ke bhavishya par bhi sankat gahrayega kyonki party ko abhi desh ke purvi or dakshini praanton main apane rajnatik vajood kii thaah lene kaa mauka bhi nahin mil paaya he
 But even more, the victory of the Congress will prove to be a lifeline for Rahul Gandhi and the path of revival of the Congress will be ready
 agar parinaam iske vipareet aate hai to phir se un do puraane daavon kii pushti hogi—pradhanmantri narendra modi or bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah kii chunaav mashinari ke karishme ko hindipattee main maat dena naammumkin he or rahul gandhi ke netritv main congress ke punarotthana kii yojana sirf kaagajon main simat kar rah jaaegi
 This may also shatter the Congress' dream of playing the role of Dhruv in building a grand alliance of opposition parties against Modi in the next elections
 ek or baat in chunaavon ko bahut dilachasp banaati he, donon bade dalon kii sidhi takkar hone vaali he
 The last such contest was in December 2017 in modi-shah's home state of Gujarat
 aakhri vakt main muqabla kaante kaa ho gaya tha
 Although the Congress failed to capitalize on the anti-incumbency wave against the ruling BJP for five consecutive times, the strength of the BJP in the 182-member Assembly fell below 100
 chunavi rajyon main ek baar phir se satta virdohi lahar kii baaten tair rahi hai or bhaajapa ke teen haai profile mukhyamantriyon—rajasthan main vasundhara raaje, madhya pradesh main shivaraj singh chouhan or chhattisgarh main raman singh kii kismat likhi jaani he
 The strongest anti-incumbency wave is seen in Rajasthan against the new Chief Minister of these three Chief Ministers Vasundhara Raje
 vaise rajasthan kaa itihaas bhi rahaa he ki vahaan kii janata sattashin dal kii vaapasi nahin karaati balki har baar rajya kii kaman duusare dal ko saunp di jaati he
 In Chhattisgarh, Raman Singh has been in power since 2003
 pichley chunaavon main netritvviheen congress ke saath hue mukaable main unhone bahut kam antar se jeet darj kii thi jo phikr kaa sabab he
 However, the results here will not worry the central leadership of both parties too much as it sends only 11 members to the state Lok Sabha
 to sabaki najar chouhan par rahegi, jo chauthi baar kaman sanbhaalane kii aas liye chunaav maidan main hai
 Shivraj Singh, one of the bjp's strongest and most popular leaders who emerged from the states, known as "madhya Pradesh's maternal uncle", is facing the toughest career test
 unhen congress kii gutbaji kaa phayda mil saktaa he, lekin antim samay main kii gai kai lok-lubhaavan rajnatik ghoshnaaen, bhaajapa ke is varisht kii bechaini or hataasha ko jaahir kar detii hai
 Modi is also said to have not shown the warmth that he expected with him on several occasions
 phir bhi, do anya mukhyamantriyon kii tarah chouhan kii ummiden bhi modi ke karishmai vyaktitv or chunaav prachaar par tiki hai jisane ateet main kai chunaavon ke parinaam badalakar rakh die hai
 The Prime Minister will stand between bjp's victory and defeat
 yah baat is tathy se bhi jaahir hoti hai ki rahul sabhi reliyon main modi or unki nitiyon ko hi nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 He rarely speaks against the Chief Minister of these states
 shaayad isiilie 11 disambar kaa parinaam narendra modi kii ajeyata par janamat sangrah bhi hoga
