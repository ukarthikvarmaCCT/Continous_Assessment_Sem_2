 Reason for having defensive thinking of Indian Army? Malik: Political leadership does not want to lose even an inch of ground
 yahi vajah he ki hamen 1999 main kargil main seemaa ko paar nahin karne diya gaya
 So, should the Cold Start doctrine of the army, which includes lightning strikes against the enemy, be considered a reaction to this defensive political mindset? Malik: No
 aisa isliye hota tha kyonki hamen harakat main aane main samay lagata tha
 These days, in a blink of an eye, situations of conflict arise, so the need to react fast has arisen

 They should be punished, this is happening

 maine uski taiyaari kii
 Your 'phantom' was also based on Navel and this time 'fitoor' is also based on 'the Great Expectations'? To me the story of the film matters whether it came from Navel or from the director's side
 ek riter yaa diarector ke liye navel se prerit hokar film likhnaa ho saktaa he thodi helpphul baat ho, lekin ek actor ko zyada fark nahin padataa

 Was there a workshop for the character? Yes, let me tell you, it was good to do a workshop while working with Gattu because you get to know the specifics of the character very well, i did a 'baar Baar Dekho' movie with Nitya too

 aapane aditya roy kapur ke saath unke vije ke dinon main intervyuu bhi kiya tha?haa lekin us jamaane ke bare main zyada yaad nahin he, bas ham donon kaaphi yang the or zyada kuch yaad nahin he
 Just Aditya had big hair
 hamane ek aid bhi saath main kiya tha
 How was it to work with Tabu in the film? In real life, Tabu is quite different from the film 'begum'
 wo bahut hi acchhee hai
 i have met her many times
 shooting ke dauraan hamane kaaphi baatcheet kii
 i used to talk to him about the industry
 kai saare sawaal poocha karti thi
 You did a two-day shoot with Rekhaji but then for some reason he did not do this film? i consider myself very lucky that i did a 2-day shoot with Rekhaji
 wo jab bhi, jahaan bhi mujhase milti hai, hameshaa unase ek alag hi conection rahaa he
 i was very excited to work with him
 lekin kabhi-kabhi film kaa mukaddar hota he
 What was the thing you loved in Kashmir? i liked the food there, especially the 'moss'
 lunch, brakefast or dinar mujhe sab bahut pasand tha
 Shooting in Kashmir was also a great experience
 vahaan barfile mausam main shoot karne main bahut majaa aayaa
 Pashmina song is being liked a lot, any memories related to the shooting of this song? We were shooting this song when people were celebrating New Year
 is gane ko shooting karte hue mujhe ek baat kaa pataa chal gaya ki jab aap kuch khote hai, to uski vajah se bahut kuch pate hai
 My health was bad in those days but i did not quit shooting and now see this song is being liked a lot
 mujhe bahut acha lag rahaa he
 We worked hard for about 7 days
 aap film relies ke dauraan hi ajmer sharif jaati hai?dekhie asli baat yah he ki main kai baar jaati hum lekin film relies ke dauraan hi meri khabaren saamne aati hai

 Many poets have defined love with their words
 alag-alag filmon main bhi pyaar ko alag dhang se dikhaaya gaya he jaise 'silsilaa' ityadi
 i am very lucky that i know what love is for me
 mere hisaab se pyaar kii gaharaai ko samajhate hue use sammanit kiya janaa chahie, tabhi wo hameshaa upyogi rahata he
 If you give respect to love, it will give you a lifetime benefit
 film kii tag line he 'ishk nahin aasaan', aap ise kitna maanati hai?dekhiye ham aksar sochate hai kal kya hua or kal kya hoga, is kal ke chakkar main ham aaj ke bare main bhul jate hai

 The Raghubar Das government of Jharkhand has taken an important decision regarding farmers
 iske mutabik rajya ke kisaanon ko krishi rin par ab sirf 1 pratishat byaaj dena hoga
 The government will give this benefit to the farmers who will repay the loan within a year
 philhal kisaanon ko 7 pratishat byaaj dena padataa he
 The central government waives 3 per cent interest on repaying the debt in a year
 ab rajya sarkaar bhi 3 fisadi byaaj maaf kar degi
 For this, the state government has made a budget provision of 40 crores
 rajya se 3 pratishat byaaj lene ke liye bainkon ko clem karnaa hoga
 The money will be returned to the banks after the claim
 yah laabh kisaan credit card ke jariye lone lene par hi milegaa
 The comments ullekhneey he ki madhya pradesh, maharashtra or desh ke kuch anya hisson main karj maafee or fasalon kii uchit keemat sahit anya maangon ko lekar pichley dinon kisaanon kaa vyapak andolan hua
 Maharashtra government announced loan waiver of farmers on Sunday
 rajya sarkaar ne iske liye maandand tay karne ke vaaste ek samiti gathit karne kaa bhi elaan kiya, jiske baad kisaanon ne apana andolan waapas le liya
 Currently farmers have to pay 7 percent interest
 ek saal main rin chuktaa karne par centre sarkaar 3 fisadi byaaj maaf kar detii he
 Now the state government will also waive 3 percent interest
 iske liye rajya sarkaar ne 40 karod ke bajet kaa praavdhaan kiya he
 Banks will have to claim to take 3 percent interest from the state
 clem ke baad bainkon ko paisa lautaaya jayega
 This benefit will be available only on taking a loan through Kisan Credit Card

 The state government also announced the formation of a committee to set the criteria for this, after which the farmers withdrew their agitation

 Speculation is rife that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose may receive the country's highest honor Bharat Ratna
 grih mantralay dwaara rigerv bank ke taksaal ko paanch bharat ratna padakon kaa order die jane se ye atakalein badhi hai
 BJP leaders have been raising demands for Atal Bihari Vajpayee to be awarded the Bharat Ratna earlier
 bhaajapa netritv vaali endie sarkaar ke pramukh narendra modi sambhavat: is bare main faisla kar sakate hai or apane swatantraaa diwas ke bhaashan main isaki ghoshnaa kar sakate hai
 Other people whose names are being discussed for Bharat Ratna include Subhash Chandra Bose
 grih mantralay ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha ki chaar din pehle sarkari taksaal ko bharat ratna ke liye paanch padak taiyaar karne ko kaha gaya he
 He said that ordering five medals does not mean that five people will be given Bharat Ratna
 yah paryaapt sankhya main padak surakshit rakhane ke liye he
 In addition, the government rules for Bharat Ratna are clear that the number of annual awards is limited to a maximum of three in a particular year
 bharat ratna ke liye anushansa pradhanmantri dwaara khud raashtrapati se kii jaati he

 The saying is fine as long as it is not linked to India's economic reforms
 bharat ke aarthik sudhaar adhuri koshishon kaa shandaar ajaayabaghar hai
 On the silver jubilee of liberalization, we must be proud that India is one of the few countries in the world that has achieved unprecedented and amazing achievements in two and a half decades, which are scattered around us in the face of increased income, services, technologies, products, facilities
 And guarantee the success of these reforms
 lekin iske baavjood aarthik sudhaaron kii badi traasadee inkaa adhuuraapan he, jo agar nahin hota to hamaare phaayde shaayad kai guna zyada hote or asangatiyaan kai guna kam
 Most start with liberalization
 isi june main modi sarkaar ne mahatvakankshi or doorgaami uddyan (aviation) niti jari kii or iske thik baad vimaanan kshetra main videshi nivesh ke niyam bhi udaar kiye gaye
 Both of these decisions were encouraging on the scale of modernity and courage, as the new policy showed the government to change the orthodox rules of foreign flights for Indian airlines and on the other hand, dared to open markets for foreign airlines
 lekin iske baad bhi yah sudhaar adhuraa hi rah gaya
 The incompleteness of the new aviation policy is more important because the liberalization of the aviation sector in India started in 1990
 1994 kii open ski niti or vimaan seva main sarkari companiyon (air india) ke ekadhikaar kii samaapti ke baad teji ai lekin 26 saal ke tajurbon ke baavjood nai vimaanan niti main is kshetra ke samgr udaarikaran kii himmat najar nahin ai
 Despite the journey of many policies, the aviation sector will still have to wait for some more policies
 urja or bijli kshetra asangatiyon kaa shandaar namoona he
 Private companies were allowed to produce electricity in 1992 (independent Power Producers Policy) and in 1993 the exemption to extract coal for productive use (captive)
 nabbe ke dashak main rajya bijli bordon ke punargathan or 2000 ke dashak main nae bijli kanoon sahit kai kadamon ke baavjood bijli sudhaar puure nahin hue
 Meanwhile, the government accelerated the pace of foreign investment in the coal sector and the allocation of captive mines-scam-reallocation took place
 urja nitiyon main tamaam pherbadal ke baavjood bijli or urja sudhaar adhure uljhe or pechida rahe
 The government privatized production but electricity distribution remained mostly under government control
 sarkarein bijli daren tay karne kii raajnneeti chhodia nahin chaahati thim, isliye bijli kshetra main niamak khulkar kaam nahin kar sake
 On the other hand, despite private investment in power generation, the government kept coal mining under its control
 in ajeeb asangatiyon ke chalate bharat kaa urja kshetra vivaadon, ghotaalon or ghaaton kaa pulinda ban gaya
 The electricity boards were in deficit in 1990 and the electricity distribution corporations of the states are still in deficit, having received three packages in the last 25 years
 teesraa package udai he, jo modi sarkaar lekar ai he
 The production and supply of electricity has increased but incompatibility has increased due to incomplete reforms in the field of coal and power distribution
 doorsanchaar sudhaaron kaa kissa bhi jaananaa jaruri he, jo lagbhag har duusare saal kisi nitigat badlaav ke baavjood aaj tak nattejey par nahin pahunch sake
 History of telecom reforms ranging from introduction of mobile service in 1993, exemption of license fees to companies in 1995, formation of TRAI, CDMA service, 2G license, liberalization of foreign investment, 3G service, 2G scam, new spectrum allocation and 4G are filled
 is udaarikaran kaa makasad bazaar main paryaapt pratispardhaa laana or upabhoktaaon ko aadhunik va sasti seva dena tha lekin doorsanchaar sudhaaron ko sahi kram nahin diya ja sakaa
 The result of incompleteness and ad-hocism of reforms is that despite spectrum scams, governments could not formulate a transparent spectrum allocation policy
 tiri ek safal va paardarshee niamak banane main asafal rahaa, isliye 2ji se 4ji tak aate-aate bazaar main pratispardhaa (operataron kii sankchaya ghati) simit rah gai
 Service quality has deteriorated and service rates have become expensive
 khudara kaarobaar ke udaarikaran ko chauthe udhaaharan ke taur par le sakate hai jisaki shuruyaat 1997 main cash and kairi main shat pratishat videshi nivesh ke saath hui thi
 In the 2000s, FDI opened in 100 per cent in single-brand retail and 51 per cent in multi-brand retail, but the reforms were not fully implemented due to political speculation
 is bich sarkaar ne haal main hi i-commers or food retail main shat pratishat videshi nivesh khol diya
 On paper, the entire retail sector is open for foreign investment, but due to procedural complications and political confusion, the investment is absent
 adhure, angadh or asangat sudhaaron ke kaaran, na chaahate hue bhi bharat main aisi arthvyavastha ban gai he jisamen khulepan ke phaayde chuninda haathon tak simit hai or bazaar kaa swasth or samanthavaadi vistaar kahin peeche chhot gaya
 The government still exists as an opportunity to distribute opportunities in this open market, while companies vying for opportunity take the cartel, alliances with leaders and corruption to taint this liberalization
 british kavi jon keats kehete the ki acchhee shuruyaat se aadha kaam khatm nahin hota
 Actually, one should not claim a good start till half way is found
 aarthik sudhaaron ne bharat ko badi nematen bakshi hai lekin sudhaaron ke talave main adhuurepan kaa ek bada kanta chubha he jo ek swasth desh ko hameshaa langadaa kar chalane par majaboor karata he

 According to the agency, a bench of Executive Chief Justice Justice Geeta and Justice c Hari Shankar said that the issue was a matter of great concern
 vishesh jarurat vaale bacchon kii vishesh shiksha kii andekhi nahin kii ja sakati
 a delay of one day will be a big loss and it will seriously affect children

 Delhi: Due to the non-appointment of special teachers for differently-abled children, HC has directed the DSSSB to file an affidavit with detailed details of the request made by the Delhi government

 It is now becoming clear that BJP is preparing to form a government in Delhi
 agle ek hafte main is bare main faisla hone ke asaar hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's return to Delhi is awaited to announce the decision
 haalanki sutara bataa rahe hai ki sarkaar banane ko lekar bijepi main ek raay nahin he
 One faction of the party has no objection to forming the government, while the other faction believes that it will benefit the Aam Aadmi Party
 isliye is mudde par faisla shaayad pradhanmantri narendra modi hi karenge
 Speaking to NDTV India, Delhi BJP President Satish Upadhyay said that at the moment we do not have enough strength to form the government
 
 
 yadi uparajyapal hamen bulaate hai, tab dekhenge
 He also said that it would not be right for him to make the party's views public before the media
 kejariwal ke kharid-farokht ke aarope kaa bhi unhone majaak udaaya
 Satish Upadhyay met with BJP mps from Delhi and is meeting BJP mlas today
 udhar, ek vigyaapan main aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejariwal bijepi par jodtod karke sarkaar banane kii koshish ke aarope laga rahe hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) accused him of trying to 'buy' the mlas and bargaining as the news of the BJP finding a way to form government in Delhi came to light
 aam aadmi party ke netaa ashutosh ne aarope lagaaya ki bijepi duusare party ke vidhayakon ko kharidne kii besharmi se koshish kar rahi he
 
 
 The mockery of democracy, constitution is being blamed
 
 
 is vidhansabha ko bhang kiya janaa chahie, aage chalakar leftinent governor sahab kii saakh par batta na lag jaae
 Earlier, Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal had said in a recorded message on Tuesday, BJP is trying to form a government in cheap and unethical ways by offering Rs 20 crore to several mlas
 kya yah loktantr he? yah puri tarah galat he
 He said, if the BJP forms government by spending more crores of rupees in such unethical ways, then such a dishonest government will only raise your electricity bills, indulge in corruption and increase the value
 'aap' dwaara phone kol ke madhyam se logon dwaara pahunchaae jane vaale sandesh main kejariwal ne kaha, kya saudebaaji jaise ghatiya tareekon se bani sarkaar mahilaon ko suraksha uplabdh kara paaegi? dilli ke purv mukhyamantri ne sandesh main pradhanmantri par bhi nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, shri narendra modi chup kyon hai? bahut ho gaya
 Now the people of Delhi will not remain silent
 kejariwal ke aarope par dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay ne kaha ki kejariwal dilli kii janata ko gumraah karte hai
 
 
 It is not necessary to tell what Kejriwal says and when he turns back
 
 
 bebuniyaad aarope lagaana unki aadat he
 It is noteworthy that Delhi had earlier held elections in December 2013, in which social activist-turned-politician Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party won 28 seats, and looked confident of returning to power
 The majority had withheld 32 seats
 isi kaaran bijepi ko sarkaar banane kii koshish se baaj aana padaa tha, or aakhirkaar kai din kii jaddojahad ke baad arvind kejariwal ne congress ke aath vidhayakon ke bina shart samarthan se sarkaar banaai thi
 Arvind Kejriwal's government resigned after being in government for just 49 days, and President's rule was imposed in the state by suspending the assembly

 When Pradhan wears a bright pink colored kurta — which is not the usual color for men in India — nothing seems strange as he is one of the few eccentric ministers of the two-year-old NDA government

 His staff includes a few additional security guards, some additional timekeepers, who are cutting down on each person's time, and representatives of APCO Worldwide, who specialize in image management and lobbying for influential and incumbents

 But today they do not have time to sit together and have tea and biscuits

 The results of the India today-org opinion poll indicate the same
 haalanki jyotiraditya sindhiya ko chunaav abhiyaan samiti kaa pramukh or ghuma-firaakar mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaae jane ke baad congress ke graph main antim daur main kuch badhotaree hui he
 The poll estimates Chauhan's BJP to get 143 seats in the 230-member assembly, despite the BJP showing an increase of 5 percent votes, which is the same as the seats it got in 2008
 surveykshan ke mutabik congress ke vot main bhi chaar pratishat kii badhotaree kaa anumaan he, lekin siton main maamuli badhotaree, pichhali baar ke 71 ke mukaable 78 kaa hi anumaan he
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan believes that the people of the state will give him a chance again due to the welfare schemes of his government
 janamat surveykshan ke nattejey bhi yahi bataate hai
 46 percent of the voters in the survey said that the trump card of the Chief Minister is the implementation of welfare schemes in these elections
 chouhan ne india today se kaha, ‘‘hamane ye yojanaayen panchayaton se baat karke lagu kii hai
 These schemes are now taking us closer to a "welfare state"
 ’’kendriya sankhyikee sanghathan ke 2012-13 ke praarambhik aankadon ke mutabik, madhya pradesh 10
 The country's top states with a 02 percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate

 5 lakh hectare se badhakaj 25 lakh hectare yani teen guna ho gaya he
 Power generation capacity has increased from 4,673 MW to 10,621 MW
 or rajya main gehun kii paidaavaar bhi teen guna ho gai he
 But Scindia and her newly-united Congress are telling voters that the figures are false
 is par vivaad he ki 17 aktubar ko sindhiya ke garh gwalior main rahul gandhi kii sabha main kitni bheed juty, jisamen rajya sarkaar ke in aankadon ko rahul, sindhiya or duusare bade netaaon ne bakawaas bataaya
 BJP leaders say that there was a crowd of 70,000 but the Congress claims that 150,000 people reached there
 bundelkhand or baghelkhand kshetron ke pichhadepan par focus kar rahi congress kii mukhya chunavi ranneeti yahi dharna paidaa karne kii he ki madhya pradesh kii pragati kii kahani acchhee lagane vaali dantakatha se zyada kuch nahin he
 Chauhan laughs at such things and mentions the website of the Union Ministry of Energy, which is responsible to Scindia as Minister of State (independent Charge)
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘main jaanata hum ki congress kya kah rahi he
 According to the website of the Ministry of Scindia itself, the power situation in Madhya Pradesh is the best in the country
 yaa to uske aankade jhuthe hai yaa phir ve sachaai se inkaar kar rahe hai
 They also refute Scindia's charge that agricultural yield figures in the state appear to have increased because the state government sells food grains received from the Center to other states
 chouhan poochhate hai, ‘‘kya aankadon main hera-pheri karnaa bacchon kaa khel he? upie sarkaar ne krishi upaj ke liye hamen award diya
 The President honored us
 kya farji aankadon par hi ye award die jate hai?’’lekin ek aarope to badastoor tikta he ki maanav vikaas suchakank ke kai maanakon par rajya kaa pradarshan behad kharaab rahaa he
 For example, the female literacy rate in the state is just 60 per cent, the infant mortality rate of 59 per 1,000 infants is much higher than the national average of 44 per cent, and the crime rate is also high
 chouhan kehete hai, ‘‘aitihaasik rup se madhya pradesh shishu mrityu dar or stri-purush anupaat jaise maamalon main pichhadaa rahaa he
 These are the areas in which improvements can be made gradually
 yah sahi he ki khaskar mahilaon ke khilaaf durbhagyapurna vaardaat or aparaadh hue hai
 But we are trying to reduce it by speeding up the cases
 ham haal hi main 10 logon ko faansee kii sajaa dilwane main safal rahe hai
 Now the investigation is being completed in 15 days and the courts are giving speedy verdict
 ’’ duusari samasya bhrashtachar kii he
 Opinion polls show 16 percent of the people as the biggest failure of the government
 chouhan kii daleel he ki rajya se afasarshahi main bhrashtachar kii khabaren isliye zyada ai hai kyonki sarkaar apane adhikariyon par ankush kasne main darati nahin he
 But BJP leaders and activists are confident that the party is getting a huge edge from the "modi wave" flowing in the state
 chouhan kehete hai ki isamen andeh nahin ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri kii reliyon ne josh bharne kaa kaam kiya he
 He says, "modiji is a popular mass leader and this truth cannot be denied
 ’’haalanki bijepi or congress donon hi abhi ummidavaar chayan or tikat bantwaare kii prakriya main hai, janamat surveykshan main yah maamla nahin dekha ja sakaa he isliye iskaa bhi kuch fark to padegaa hi
 But the wind seems to be blowing in bjp's favor, although it is not as fast as it was before Scindia landed
 to, kya koi antardhara bhi bah rahi he jise chunaav vishleshak nahin bhaanp paa rahe hai? chouhan kehete hai, ‘‘ham achche bahumat se jitkar aa rahe hai
 Before this, he explains how in the next term he will reduce dependence on agriculture by promoting small and medium scale industries in the state
 vikaas kii yojanaon vaale chouhan ke liye chunaav anchaahi yatra nahin, balki ek or yatra kii taiyaari bhar he
 With Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressing the nation on December 31, just before the start of the new year, the central government is going to launch a vigorous campaign on demonetisation

 According to information received from sources, the Prime Minister has given these instructions to all his ministers

 In these places, they should rally or hold public meetings and explain the benefits of demonetisation to the people

 isamen bataaya gaya he ki notebandi yah faisla kyon vakt kii jarurat thi or shiksha, kheti sahit desh ke vikaas main isse kya phayda hoga
 In fact, the Central Government has realized that the problems related to Kinotbandi will continue for some more time

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Tuesday that the state is not ready to bring petrol and diesel under the GST

 switzraland ke diggaj tennis star roger federer ne ravivaar ko kroeshia ke marin chilich ko aasaani se haraate hue saal ke tisare grand slam-wimbledon kaa purush ekal khitaab jeet liya
 This is Federer's record eighth title win at the All England Club
 apane duusare grand slam or pehle wimbledon khitaab ke liye prayasarat chilich kii federer ke saamne ek nahin chali
 In the direction of his career's 19th Grand Slam title, Federer defeated Quil Nishikori of Japan in 2014, winning the US Open 6-3, 6-1, 6-4
 2014 se 16 ke bich teen baar wimbledon quarter final main pahunchakar haarane vaale chilich ne pehali baar is agrani grass court toornament ke final main jagah banaai thi lekin grass court kaa badshaah kahe jane vaale federer ne unhen pehali baar wimbledon kaa badshaah nahin banane diya
 On the other hand, Federer, who won the Australian Open title this year, became the winner once again, playing his 11th final at Wimbledon
 vah 2014, 2015 main bhi final main pahunche the lekin vah srbija ke novak jokovik ke haathon haar gaye the
 Also in 2016, he lost in the semi-finals to Milos Raonic of Canada
 baharhaal, pehle set kii shuruyaat main chilich ne apana class dikhaaya or ek samay 2-2 kii barabari par pahunch gaye the lekin baad main vah federer ke adwitiya class or anubhav ke aage bebas najar aae
 Federer extended the match to another set by naming the set 6-3
 doosraa set chilich ke liye or bhi niraashajanak sabit hua
 He could win a game in this set
 federer ne apana varchasv kaayam karte hue yah set 6-1 se jeeta or yah jataa diya ki unke anubhav or clasik tennis ke aage chilich kii tejatarraar sarvice kii ek nahin chalane vaali he
 In the third and decisive set, Chilich made a blistering start to take a 2–1 lead
 vah is set main pehle se behatar najar aae
 Federer then went on to win two games to tie it 3-3 and then go 5-3 but Chilich tried to thrill the match by scoring 4-5 but Federer showed his experience here to give Chilich a comeback Did not get a chance and also did the match with the set
 is tarah federer ne aathvin baar ol england club main apana paracham laharaaya
 At one time, he was said to have been paid but the stalwart player made a great comeback on the court and did justice to his reputation
 federer ne isse pehle 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 or 2012 main yahaan champion banane kaa gaurav hasil kiya tha
 The comments wimbledon main aath khitaab ke alaava federer paanch baar austrailian open, ek baar french open or paanch baar america open khitaab jeet chuke hai
 Significantly, the women's singles Grand Slam title was captured by Spain's Garbine Muguruza
 garbine ne paanch baar kii champion venus williams ko aasaani se sidhe set main 6-4, 6-0 se shikast dekar pehla wimbledon mahila ekal grandslam khitaab apni jholii main daalaa tha
 Having lost the Wimbledon quarter-finals three times between 2014 and 16, Chilich made it to the finals of this pioneering grass court tournament for the first time, but Federer, who was called the Emperor of the Grass Court, did not allow him to become Wimbledon's king for the first time
 duusari ore, is saal austrailian open khitaab jeet chuke federer wimbledon main apana 11waan final khelte hue ek baar phir vijeta bane
 He also reached the final in 2014, 2015 but lost to Novak Djokovic of Serbia
 iske alaava 2016 main vah semifinal main canada ke milos raonic ke haathon haar gaye the
 However, Chilich showed his class at the start of the first set and reached a 2–2 level at one time but later appeared to be unfazed by Federer's unique class and experience
 federer ne yah set 6-3 se apane naam kar match ko duusare set tak badhaayaa
 The second set proved to be even more disappointing for Chilich
 vah is set main ek game jeet sake
 Federer dominated the set and won the set 6–1, stating that Chilich's flamboyant service was not going to go well beyond his experience and classic tennis
 tisare or nirnaayak set main chilich ne dhamaakedaar shuruyaat karte hue 2-1 kii badhat hasil kar lee
 He looked better in this set than before
 federer ne iske baad do game jitate hue 3-3 kii barabari or phir 5-3 se aage ho gaye lekin chilich ne score 4-5 kar match ko romaanch dene kaa prayaas kiya lekin federer ne yahaan apane anubhav kaa kamaal dikhaate hue chilich ko vaapasi kaa mauka nahin diya or set ke saath match bhi apane naam kiya

 RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav on Thursday lashed out at Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, asking why he does not get special state status for Bihar by asking his boss (prime Minister Modi)? Lalu made this statement when two ministers of the Telugu Desam Party resigned from the Union Cabinet for not giving special status to Andhra Pradesh

 Sushil Modi said that if there had been any concern for development during the lalu-rabri regime of 15 years, Bihar would have reached the pinnacle of prosperity today without special state status
 lalu parivaar par tanj kasate hue susheel modi ne kaha ki garibon ko khai main dhakelne vaale log aaj vishesh rajya ke pairokaar ban rahe hai
 Modi asked the question that when the proposal to grant special state status to Bihar was passed by the NDA government led by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and submitted to the central KUPA government by the Legislature, then Lalu's party was involved in the central government

 ab desh tisare, duusare or pehle number par bhi pahonchega

 He has got home, electricity, gas, toilets and Ayushman Bharat card
 jab unase sadhvi pragna ke godse par die bayaan ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki desh ke bahusankhyak nafrat nahin failaate
 Is it a crime to be a Hindu? Homes were built for poor, roads were built and cards of Ayushman Bharat were distributed and no one was asked for religion

 iske baad modi sarkaar ke 4 saal ke kaarykaal main kaale dhan par lagaam kasne ke liye kai kadam uthaae gaye
 The figure came to 8392 crore in 2015 under the Modi government
 vahiin, 2016 main isamen record kami ai or yah 4500 karod rupee ke str par pahunchaa
 Has the shortfall come from the efforts of the Modi government? Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken many steps against black money during his four-year tenure
 lekin sirf modi sarkaar ke prayaason se isamen safalataa nahin mili he
 Self banks have always been under the scanner of critics for being a safe haven for black money
 2010 ke baad se duniyabar ke kai deshon ne swiss sarkaar par dabaav bananaa shuru kiya taaki ve apane kade niyamon ko aasaan kar kaale dhan yahaan chupaane waalon par ankush lagaae
 Deposits reduced due to loosening of rules: After this Switzerland protested for a long time, but finally the government here agreed to relax its banking rules
 iske baad swiss sarkaar ne kai deshon ke saath sandhi kii
 It also includes India
 is sandhi ke tahat switzraland sambandhit desh ke khataadharakon kii jaankaree kuch sharton ke saath saajha karne ke liye taiyaar hua
 Due to this many people started withdrawing their money from self banks
 bainkon ne gharelu str par hi kaarobaar badhaane par diya focus:iske saath hi vaishvik str par bad rahe dabaav ke chalate swiss bainkon ne gharelu str par hi apane kaarobaar ko badhaane par focus karne kii taraf dhyaan dena shuru kiya
 So he not only tightened the rules of keeping money for foreigners, but also shifted his focus to serving in the country itself
 isse bhi kahin-na-kahin swiss bainkon main bharat samet anya deshon kii jamaa raashi kam hui

 sawaal ye bhi he ki taxi driver kii hatya karne vaale aatankiyon ne unhen bina gambhir nuksaan pahunchaae kaise chhod diya
 Why did he leave without arms? espi ne khud ko bataaya peeditisase pehle ek bayaan main espi ne kaha tha ki vah khud peedit hai, sandigdh nahin
 He had serious injuries
 pathankot ke coliaan mode par achaanak aatanki unki gaadi main ghus gaye
 He asked to turn off the light inside
 unhen peeche dhakel diya
 All the terrorists were at gunpoint
 i could be wrong but i reckon we’ve caught Prince Harry red handed stealing some samosas from the Meghan’s ‘together’ cookbook event they were at today!! Have a watch

 com / 3bwd0tyqj8 america main giraftaar mumbai hamale ke sandigdh tahawwur hossain rana ke maamle kii sunwaayee ke liye 17 may ko juri chayan prakriya se koi 20 ummidavaaron ko baahar kar diya gaya
 The reasons for being excluded from the selection process included having a biased view against Muslims as well as many other reasons
 nyaayadhish james lininewebar ne puure din sambhavit juri sadasyon kaa saakshaatkaar liya
 During the interview Leinenweber primarily tried to find out if the potential jurors had a negative view of Islam and about Muslims
 jahaan adhikansh sambhavit juri sadasyon ne kaha ki unhen islam or musalamaanon se koi dwesh nahin he, vahiin kuch aise bhi the, jinhone kaha ki ve islam kaa aadar nahin karte
 a likely jury member with number 14 was like that
 16 may ko jo prashn talika sambhavit 100 juri sadasyon ko saunpi gai thi, usamen is khaas sadsy ne sambhavat: likhaa tha, "aatankwaadi mukhyarup se muslim hai, kya main galat kah rahaa hu?" nyaayadhish ne rana ke liye nishpaksh sunwaayee ke hit main is ummidavaar ko tatkaal khaarij kar diya
 Numbers have been used to identify jurors, taking privacy and personal safety into account
 sankhya-15 vaale ummidavaar ko isliye baahar kar diya gaya, kyonki islam ke bare main sakht drushtikon ke kaaran vah nishpaksh nahin ho sakati thim
 She was a woman of Southeast Asian descent
 ek or sambhavit juri sadsy, sankhya-21 ko isliye khaarij kar diya gaya, kyonki dusron par faisla paarit karne main unhen ek naitik samasya thi
 The candidate after him said that he has equal pain in the teeth and shoulders, due to which he is unable to concentrate on the task at hand
 unhone kaha ki chunki vah berozegaar hai, lihaaja vah koi swasthya beemaa bhi nahin kara paae hai
 These monsievers were also excluded from the selection process
 juri sadsy sankhya-28 ek mahila thim
 He was freed because he stated that his mind was not well after his sister was allegedly murdered by a policeman
 isi tarah juri sankhya-36 ko isliye khaarij kar diya gaya, kyonki unhone kaha ki vah sarkaar par vishwaas nahin karatin or aatankwaad kii samasya badhachadha kar pesh kii gai he
 The judge also asked potential jurors during the selection process the question of whether they wanted equal legal rights for US citizens and non-us citizens
 kai iske bare main anishchit the, magar kai aise bhi the jo samaan adhikaar die jane ke khilaaf the, jabaki america samvidhan samaan adhikaar kii guarantee detaa he
 It is known that Rana is accused of providing help to his American friend David Coleman Headley of Pakistani origin
 hedli 26 navambar, 2008 ko mumbai main hue aatankwaadi hamale kii sajeesh rachane main lipt rahaa he
 Headley and Rana studied together in high school
 rana (50) apane vakeelon ke saath adaalat kaksh main maujuud tha or sambhavit juri sadasyon ke kuch javaabon par muskaraata tha
 Sometimes he would write something
 juri chayan kii prakriya guuruuvaar tak chalane kii sambhaavna he
 Under this, 12 genuine jurors, six alternate members and 20 other jurors will be selected, so that the prosecution and defense can be given the opportunity to dismiss the objectionable members
 bachaav paksh ko 10 chaynit sadasyon ko khaarij karne kaa adhikaar he, to vahiin abhiyojan paksh chah juri sadasyon ko khaarij kar saktaa he
 The trial of the case will begin on May 23
 tippaniyan He said, 'first of all we need to make it very clear that things fall within its scope and what things the player needs to keep in mind while on the field
 maidan par kaaphi chijen hoti hai jinamein se kuch aap maukey kii garmi main kar dete hai
 'kohli said,' But you don't know what to do if you add one or two or three digits to your account
 isliye mujhako lagata he ki aajkal iraade par gaur kiya jaataa he or khilaadi ko ise dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 It may be a small thing but if the intention is to do something wrong then of course it goes against the player
 ’(hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) unhone kaha, ‘sabase pehle to hamen yah bilkul spasht karne kii jarurat he ki kya chijen iske daayre main aati hai or maidan par rahete samay khilaadi ko kya chijen dimag main rakhane kii jarurat he
 a lot of things happen on the field, some of which you do in the heat of chance
 ’ kohli ne kaha, ‘lekin aapako nahin pataa ki kya karne par aapke khate main ek yaa do yaa teen ank jud jaaenge
 So i think that nowadays intention is taken into consideration and the player should keep this in mind
 yah bhale hi choti cheez ho lekin agar iraadaa kuch galat karne kaa he to beshak yah khilaadi ke khilaaf jaataa he
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 )(hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) rajasthan main bijepi kii raah par chali congressmahine main 20 din congress daftar main baithenge mantricongress kaaryakartaaon kii samasya sunenge congress mantrirajasthan main congress kii sarkaar bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kii raah chalegi
 During the BJP rule, what the Congress was cursing the BJP will now be implemented in the Rajasthan Congress office as well
 rajasthan congress ke jaipur daftar main maheene ke 20 din sabhi mantri kaaryakartaaon ke kaamon ke liye baithenge, jahaan par bijepi ke tarj par congress ke kaaryakartaaon kii sunwaayee kii jaaegi
 In the co-ordination meeting between the organization and power, it has been decided that if the minister stays in Jaipur, before going to his office for 20 days of the month, he will sit in the Congress office and listen to the problem of Congress workers and remove it
 iske alaava koi bhi mantri kisi bhi jile ke daure par jaataa he, to jila congress ke daftar main jayega or vahaan par kaaryakartaaon kii sunwaayee karegaa
 Actually, there was a complaint from the state president of the Congress and the state Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot that the Congress government has been formed in the state but Congress workers are not asking
 ise dekhte hue sachin payalat or ashok gahalot ke saath congress ke prabharee mahasachiv avinaash pandey kii baithak main yah faisla kiya gaya ki ab se congress ke mantri jaipur main rahenge to congress daftar main baithenge or jaipur ke baahar rahenge to jila congress ke daftar main baithenge
 After losing the Lok Sabha elections in Rajasthan, the Congress wants to energize its workers before the local body elections, so a campaign has been launched to hear their problems in charging the workers
 is kavayad se congress ke sadsyta abhiyaan main bhi teji aegi
 Earlier, when the Congress government was formed, then Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had taken the order that all the ministers of the state would go to their residence in the morning so that the BJP and Congress workers could not be distinguished in this and all the people came and presented their problems to the minister
 Can say usamen yah kaha gaya tha ki ham bijepi kii tarah apane daftar main apane hi kaaryakartaaon kii sunwaayee nahin karenge
 This tradition started during the previous BJP government
 isamen bijepi ke mantri bijepi ke daftar main baithkar bijepi ke kaaryakartaaon kii sunwaayee karte the
 For that, he had to give a certificate of being a BJP worker
