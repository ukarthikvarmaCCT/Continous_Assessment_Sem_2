 Book: The Skeptical Patriot Writer: Sidin Vadukkut: Rs 250 Pblicher: Rupa Publications India was the richest nation in the world, there is no evidence of imperialism among Indians, Indians were at the forefront of surgery, the invention of zero happened in India, this book questions all the beliefs like et cetera
 Shakti Patriot) is an attempt by journalist and writer Sidin Vadukut
 unhoneiske jariye un manyataon par phir se prashnchihn lagaaya he jo lagbhag maan liye gaye hai
 The author says that he is inquisitive and therefore has questioned these beliefs
 usne kai tarah ke shodh patron, granthon, uddharanon kaa sahaara lekar yah bataane kii koshish kii he ki inamen se bahut si baaten sahi nahin he or hai bhi to aanshik rup se
 The author says that we Indians get overwhelmed by hearing and reading all the things of our past, even if they are far from the reality
 ham unke peeche kii sachai ko tarkon ke taraazoo par tolane kii koshish bhi nahin karte or na hi unki sachai kaa pataa lagane kaa prayaas karte hai
 We just accept them
 iskaa hi nateeja he ki aaj soshal media main is tarah kii bhrantijanak baaten fail rahi hai jinka sach se koi sambandh nahin he
 We have such a large amount of material that we follow them blindly and imitate them
 lekhak kaa kahana he ki haalat yahaan tak pahunch gai he ki hamaare sarkari report, sansadeey sawaal-jawaab or course kii kitabon main atishyokti se kaam liya ja rahaa he
 Such things are written and even studied in the name of the nation's love, which are not related to the truth
 lekhak ne is bare main kuch tathy bhi die hai
 The author says that we have to come out of this weakness of so-called patriotism and everything should be accepted only after meeting the test of logic and research
 udhaaharan ke liye usne yah sabit karne kii koshish kii he ki bharat ke bare main manyata he ki bharatiyon ne kisi anya desh par kabhi akraman nahin kiya or na hi unki zamin par kabja kiya
 But the author has tried to prove from the quotes of many historians and researchers that the kings of the Chola dynasty invaded and subjugated several kingdoms of East Asia
 unhone kaaphi lambey samay tak srilanka or maldive par raaj kiya tha
 The king-king here was notorious for attacking each other
 lekhak ne chol vansh ke raajaaon kii shakti ke bare main kaaphi kuch likhaa he or kai uddharanon ke jariye unhen sach sabit karne kii koshish bhi kii he
 Similarly, the author has also doubted that India was the richest country in the world
 uskaa kahana he ki tamaam saboot is ore koi prakaash nahin daalate
 He says that at that time there was no scale to measure the wealth and wealth of a country
 jidipi kisi desh kii aarthik unnati ko naapane kii ek nai vyavastha he or us samay aisa kuch nahin tha jiske aadhaar par kaha jaae ki bharat duniya kaa sabase samrudh desh tha
 However, he has acknowledged that India had immense wealth, as exemplified by the fact that Iranian looter Nadir Shah had looted a lot of loot and carried gold ornaments and jewels on thousands of camels and horses
 iske baavjood bharat kii daulat main khaas kami nahin ai
 The author has also raised many other issues like whether radio was invented by Jagdish Chandra Basu
 iske liye usne kai tarah ke prakashnon or shodh ko sahaara liya he
 He does not dismiss this and tells her the truth to a large extent
 is kitaab main lekhak ne chuninda shodhakartaaon or lekhakon kaa hawala dekar apni baat rakhi he
 In a way, he has tried to make his criticism healthy and factual
 usne videshi or bhartiya, donon tarah ke itihaaskaaron or vidwaanon kii baaten saamne rakhi hai jo uski baton ko kaaphi had tak pramanik banaati hai
 Given that there is no very authentic document about the history of ancient India, it does not seem possible to draw some conclusions
 madhya yug se pehle ke bharat ke bare main hamaare paas na to sahitya he or na hi likhit dastavej
 If anything, it would have been destroyed by the foreign invaders, because they burned and destroyed thousands of prized texts kept in our temples and Nalanda University
 isliye pracheen bharat ke bare main bahut thodi hi jaankaree uplabdh he
 Foreign travelers such as Megasthenes, Hiuen Tsang, Fa-hian, Ibn Battuta, etc
, wrote about India, which is an authentic part of our ancient history
 baharhaal yah kitaab bahut zyada vishyon par to nahin kahati, lekin itnaa jarur bataati he ki ham jis baat se gauravanvit mahasoos karte hai, ho saktaa he vaisaa kuch hua hi na ho
 By the way, what has been said and written all over the world about India, the research work of its truth may not be completed for many years
 lekhak ke andar kii jigyaasa ne is kitaab ko janm diya he jo is disha main ek chota sa prayaas bhar he
 It is certain that due to its grip on the language, the author has succeeded in keeping the curiosity alive and this is the biggest feature of this book

 is din ravan dahan se buraai par achchhai kii jeet maani jaati he lekin ravan ke bare main aisi kuch baaten hai jo aapako jarur janani chahie
 1
 ravan aadha brahan or aadha rakshas kul kaa tha
 His father's name was Vishwasrava and mother's name was Kakeshi
 2
 Ravana's name was Dasagriva or Dashanan in childhood
 jaane, dashahra pujan or ravan dahan kaa shubh muhoort3
 Ravana killed King Anaranya of the Ichhavashu dynasty
 isi vansh ke shriram the
 While dying, the king cursed Ravana that the son of King Dasharatha would kill you
 4
 Ravana also tried to kill Bali, the king of monkeys
 bali us samay samudr ke kinare surya kii puja kar rahe the
 If you are unable to go to Kullu on Dussehra, then know here 5 special things about it
 ravan sirf yuddh kala main hi nipun nahin tha balki use veda or jyotishi kaa bhi kaaphi gyaan tha
 6
 ram ne jab lanka par hamalaa karne ke liye ramsetu banaaya tha tab ravan ne purohit hone kadharmanibhaayaa tha
 7
 ravan shashan-kala or kootneeti kii kala main maahir tha
 While Ravana was counting his last breath, Rama sent his brother Lakshmana to Ravana to receive this education
 8
 Ravana's empire was spread over Balidweep (bali), Malaadweep (malaysia), Angadweep, Shankhadweep, Khushdweep
 9

 sachin payalat ne kaha ki ham hinsa kaa samarthan nahin karte lekin virodh karne ke adhikaar ko sarkaar bal se dabaa nahin sakati
 Pilot said, it is the responsibility of every citizen of the country to come forward to save the tampering with the Constitution
 dilli main jis tarah se shantipurna pradarshan karne vaale logon par bal prayog kiya gaya or kai vishvavidhyalayon main ghuskar chaatro ko maaraa gaya use sahi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Sachin Pilot said that due to the repression of the government, fear is in the hearts of the people
 payalat ne modi sarkaar par tanj karte hue kaha ki ham gandhi ji kii 150veen varshganth manaa rahe hai or aise main jis tarah se desh main hinsa kaa maahaul he vah thik nahin he
 The government should consider the Citizenship Amendment Act

 Due to this, the environment of the country is deteriorating
 sachin payalat ne kaha ki hinsa kaa adhikaar kisi ko nahin he lekin virodh karne kaa adhikaar sarkaar ko nahin chhinana chahie
 We cannot tolerate the manner in which protesters are being captured and detained

 In fact, to activate the cleanliness drive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the engineers in charge were directed by the state government to get the people of their area to download the cleanliness on mobile, so that the corporation boards of their area get better ranking for the cleanliness survey 2018
 lekin ejiniyaron ne is sarkari nirdesh ko kachare ke dibbe main daal diya
 Engineers neither downloaded this app on their own mobile nor motivated the public for it

 By marking such areas, the state's urban administration department has taken on the engineers
 unhen kaaran bataao notice jari kiya gaya, saath hi ek maah kaa vetan kaatane ke nirdesh die gaye hai
 There has been an uproar in the Urban Administration Department after the instructions to cut the salary

 Usually, action has been taken against engineers on construction works, maps and other administrative tasks

 Someone whose eyes are very kind
 
 
 jo tumhen dekhe to lagata he ki wo tumhaari bahut care karata he
 Talking about her 30-year-old friendship with Deepika, Sneha further wrote, 'someone who is so fond of keeping everything well that his favorite thing is a label-maker, so that he can never fix your house Be ready to do
 kya aap kisi aise ko jaanate hai jo jab bhi ghoomane jaae aapke liye hotel se shampoo kii choti-choti bottlen churaae, meraa matlab he ikatthi kare, kyonki use pataa he ki aapako wo pasand hai? main jaanati hum! main jaanati hum!''wo meri dost deepi he

 april kii 20 taarikh kii subah andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri en
 Chandrababu Naidu was going to sit on a day's fast in Vijayawada
 unhen bataaya gaya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi unhen phone par janmdin kii badhai dena chaahate hai
 Naidu did not respond and sat on the dais for the fast with his supporters
 dhire-dhire upwas sthal par samarthakon kii bheed badhati chali gai or manch se bhaashanon kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya
 The fasting program was named "dharma Porata Diksha" (struggle for justice)
 naam ke anuroop telugu desham party (tidipi) ke netaaon ne yah bataane kii koshish kii ki centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja na dekar rajya kii paanch karod janata ke saath anyaay kiya he
 But for Naidu, a trusted friend of Modi a few months ago, now BJP has become an untouchable
 naidu ne shaam ko saadhe saat baje anshan samaapt karne se pehle apana bhaashan diya
 He accused Modi of deceit with the state, terming Modi as his junior in politics
 raajnneeti ke maahir khilaadi naidu ne na sirf rajya main apni virdohi viesarsi congress (jaganmohan reddy) ko apni siyaasi vyuh rachana main gherne kii koshish kii, balki 2019 main kendriya raajnneeti main apni mahati bhoomika ke liye bhi taal thok di
 Will he have an important role in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections or is his focus only on maintaining his government in Andhra Pradesh? Naidu says, "national politics is not new to TDP
 neshnal front, third front or endie ke gathan main hamane nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Naidu estimates that in 2019, the BJP will suffer losses in many states and the role of other parties will become important
 is akalan ko unke bete lokesh ek kadam aage le jaakar kehete hai, "agle kuch maheenon main kai rajyon main chunaav hai jisamen bhaajapa ko mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 In such a situation, if a coalition is formed before the election or after the election, there is a possibility that the BJP can be stopped at the Center, then South India will definitely have a role and the responsibility of TDP will increase
 '' to, kya tidipi rajya se adhik centre par focus kar rahi he? lokesh kehete hai, "tidipi kaa puraa focus rajya he
 We are demanding justice for the state but a prominent leader (jagan) is with the center inside
 dilli main modi ke pair choote hai or rajya ke swabhimaan ko thes pahunchaa rahe hai
 "actually, the statement of Naidu and his son Lokesh is being accepted as an acceptance to make the entire state politics self-centered
 andhra pradesh ke raajnneetik maamalon ke jaankaar ji
 Says Murali, "naidu is well aware that the self-respect of the state is an issue with which it can get power for the second time
 jagan se paar paane ke liye tidipi is ore bad chuki he
 She accuses Jagan of touching Modi's feet, keeping him in collusion, party workers go to the villages where the water purifies by washing the way with water
 ''haalanki modi par siyaasi hamalaa, rajya ke swabhimaan kaa mudda or shuddhikaran jaise mudde ko ek saath chalaanaa anayas nahin he
 In fact, Jagan created conditions for Naidu that caused a do or die situation for him in Andhra Pradesh
 andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja nahin milane ke mudde ko jagan ne rajya main uthaanaa shuru kiya
 Unhappy with this, the TDP forced the resignation of its ministers from the Modi government
 lekin samarthan jari rakhaa
 Jagan called it a sham
 majaboor hokar tidipi ne endie se baahar hone kaa elaan kiya
 Jagan took another step and brought a no-confidence motion against the Modi government
 baad main naidu bhi avishvaas prastaav laane ke liye baadhya hue
 Jagan was largely successful in conveying to the state that the YSR Congress is more dedicated to the interest of the state
 naidu to apni sthiti bachaane ke liye majaburi main modi se dur hone kaa naatak kar rahe hai
 Therefore, Naidu kept a fasting program in the name of granting special status to Andhra Pradesh on the occasion of his birthday
 aarope-pratyaropon ke bich beete chaar saal main khaskar pichley kuch maheenon main rajya kii siyasat main kaaphi kuch badal gaya
 In 2014, TDP and BJP came together
 film abhinayta pawan kalyaan kii party jansena kaa samarthan modi-naidu kii jodi ko mila
 Now the situation has changed
 pawan kalyaan tidipi kii aalochana kar rahe hai
 Jagan was under the scanner of various investigating agencies in the last four years but has now largely gone out of the scope of investigation
 unke khaas sipahsalaar maane jane vaale vijay sai reddy ne vah rasta lagbhag bana diya he jiske jariye bhaajapa ko jagan ko saath lene main mushkil nahin hogi
 This is what Naidu also wanted
 ji
 Murali says the BJP in the state is not in a position to win on its own
 naidu, jagan or bhaajapa alag-alag ladati hai to adhik nuksaan tidipi ko ho saktaa he
 The reason is the anti-incumbency trend
 duusari vajah he pichley chaar saal main naidu ne sudhaar ke bahut saare kaam to kiye hai lekin ve sarkaar kii janakalyankari yojanaon kaa sudhaar se talmail nahin bitha sake hai
 Conversely when Vai
 rajasekhar reddy mukhyamantri the to unhone apane purvavarti siem naidu ke shuru kiye gaye sudhaar kaaryon ko apni yojanaon ke saath joda
 Therefore, they could also develop the state and maintain popularity through both reform and public welfare schemes
 naidu kaa puraa focus sirf sudhaar ke kaary main he
 In such a situation, on the front of public welfare, they are only seen to carry forward the works of Rajasekhara Reddy

 raashtrapati pad ke liye endie kii ore se ummidavaar chunane main ho rahi deree ke bich bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne ek baar phir gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi par dhakaa-chipa hamalaa karte hue kaha he ki endie ko varsh 2014 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav se kaaphi pehle pradhanmantri pad kaa apana pratyaashee ghoshit kar dena chahie, or use dharmanirpeksh chhavi vaala hi hona chahie
 On the other hand, BJP leader and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi also said that the prime ministerial candidate will be announced before the Lok Sabha elections
 ek samachaarpatr ko die saakshaatkaar main nitish ne yah bhi spasht kiya ki vah swayan pradhanmantri pad kii daud main shaamil nahin hai, lekin is ummidavaar ko aisa hona chahie, jis par koi daag na ho or vah udaaravaadi vichaardhaara kaa ho
 It is worth mentioning that Nitish had said this a week ago that the Prime Minister of the country should have a secular image
 isi ke saath nitish ke saath milakar bihar sarkaar ko chalaa rahe bhaajapa netaa susheel modi ne bhi pradhanmantri pad ke pratyaashee ke rup main is vakt kisi bhi netaa kaa naam nahin liya, or kaha ki prayek ko apane vichaar vyakt karne kaa adhikaar he
 He almost rejected Narendra Modi and said that the Prime Minister should have a clean and liberal image like that of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, which is acceptable to all classes
 unhone yah bhi kaha endie kii ore se pradhanmantri pad kaa pratyaashee sahi samay aane par hi chunaa jayega, or is vakt kisi ke bare main bhi kuch nahin kahana chahie
 He, however, made it clear that the candidate would belong to the NDA, and would be announced before the Lok Sabha elections
 susheel modi kaa yah bhi daawa he ki is samay kisi bhi mudde ko lekar endie gathbandhan ko koi khatra nahin he
 On the other hand, Janata Party leader Subramanian Swamy met senior BJP leader LK Advani on Tuesday and said that whatever the Nitish is saying, the NDA has to take the final decision
 tippaniyan On the other hand, RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav questioned Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar after this rhetoric that if Nitish is really so much against Modi (narendra) then why is he with him till now
 
 
 ? It is noteworthy that these incidents of ongoing confrontation between Nitish and Narendra Modi are not new
 sabase pehle gujarat sarkaar ke ek poster main modi ke saath chhaapi gai apni tasviir par nitish ne tikhaa aitaraaz jataayaa tha, or jab narendra modi ne yaad dilaayaa ki bihar main kosi kii baadh ke vakt gujarat ne madad di thi, to bihar ne gujarat ko vah rakam tak lautaa di thi
 After this, under the pressure of Nitish during the assembly elections in Bihar, BJP could not even invite Modi to campaign
 abhi haal hi main narendra modi ne bhi bihar kii khasta haalat ke liye sthaneey netaaon dwaara kii ja rahi jativaadee raajnneeti ko jimmedaar tehraaya, or is par javaabi hamalaa karte hue nitish ne bhi narendra modi ko apni girebaan main jhaankne or bihar ko lekar tippanee nahin karne kii salaah di thi
 In an interview to a newspaper, Nitish also made it clear that he himself is not involved in the race for the post of Prime Minister, but this candidate should be someone who has no stain and is of liberal ideology
 ullekhneey he ki nitish ne ek hafte pehle bhi yahi kaha tha ki desh kaa pradhanmatri dharmanirpeksh chhavi vaala hona chahie
 Simultaneously, BJP leader Sushil Modi, who is running the Bihar government in association with Nitish, also did not name any leader at this time as the prime ministerial candidate, and said that everyone has the right to express his views
 unhone narendra modi ko lagbhag khaarij karte hue kaha ki pradhanmantri ko purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi jaisi saaf-suthri or udaar chhavi vaala hona chahie, jo sabhi virgon ko sweekaarya ho
 He also said that the prime ministerial candidate will be chosen by the NDA only when the time is right, and nobody should say anything about it at this time
 unhone haalanki yah spasht kiya ki ummidavaar endie kaa hi hoga, or loksabhaa chunaav se pehle ghoshit kiya jayega
 Sushil Modi also claims that at present there is no threat to the NDA alliance on any issue
 udhar, janata party ke netaa subrahmanyam swami ne mangalvaar ko hi bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani se mulaakaat kii or kaha ki nitish jo kuch bhi kah rahe hon, antim faisla endie ko karnaa he
 The comments duusari ore, argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav ne is bayaanbaji ke baad bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki agar nitish ko (narendra) modi se vaaki itnaa parhez he to ab tak vah unke saath kyon hai
 
 
 The ullekhneey he ki nitish or narendra modi ke bich jari takaraav kii ye ghatnaayen nai nahin hai
 Nitish was quick to object to his photograph printed with Modi in a Gujarat government poster, and when Narendra Modi reminded that Gujarat had helped during the Kosi floods in Bihar, Bihar gave Gujarat The amount was even returned

 Recently, Narendra Modi also blamed the casteist politics being practiced by the local leaders for the poor condition of Bihar, and while retaliating, Nitish too did not look at Narendra Modi in his poverty and did not comment on Bihar Was advised
 isi ke saath nitish ke saath milakar bihar sarkaar ko chalaa rahe bhaajapa netaa susheel modi ne bhi pradhanmantri pad ke pratyaashee ke rup main is vakt kisi bhi netaa kaa naam nahin liya, or kaha ki prayek ko apane vichaar vyakt karne kaa adhikaar he
 He almost rejected Narendra Modi and said that the Prime Minister should have a clean and liberal image like that of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, which is acceptable to all classes
 unhone yah bhi kaha endie kii ore se pradhanmantri pad kaa pratyaashee sahi samay aane par hi chunaa jayega, or is vakt kisi ke bare main bhi kuch nahin kahana chahie
 He, however, made it clear that the candidate would belong to the NDA, and would be announced before the Lok Sabha elections
 susheel modi kaa yah bhi daawa he ki is samay kisi bhi mudde ko lekar endie gathbandhan ko koi khatra nahin he

 The conflict between the BJP and Shiv Sena over the 50-50 formula in Maharashtra does not seem to be diminishing
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne aaj bijepi ke saath hone vaali baithak radd kar di he
 Shiv Sena spokesman Sanjay Raut said on Tuesday that when the Chief Minister is saying that there is no talk on the formula of 50-50, then on whom will it happen
 idhar aaj bijepi ke vidhayakon kii bhi baithak hogi jisamen vidhayak dal kaa netaa chunaa jayega
 Shiv Sena leaders will also meet today to discuss the current situation
 iske alaava NCP ke netaaon kii bhi aaj baithak hone vaali he
 The question in Maharashtra is that who will be the chief minister and for how many days? Fadnavis is saying that there is no talk of 50-50 in front of him, while Shiv Sena has been speaking since yesterday that BJP is lying - it was talked in front of everyone
 mangalvaar ke din mukhyamantri ne jahaan diwali bhet ke dauraan ek baar phir se yah baat doharaai kii agle 5 saalon tak vahi mukhyamantri honge to vahiin shivasena netaa ne dobaaraa se dhai saalon tak mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar bataa rahi he
 However, by the evening, the Chief Minister was soft in his statement and said that he was not aware of the conversation between BJP President Amit Shah and Shiv Sena Chief
 maamle kii shuruyaat loksabhaa chunaav se pehle hue bijepi shivasena baithak se hui jisamen uddhav thakare or devendra fadanvis ne baraabar zimmedaari baantne kii baat kahi
 At the same time, now the manipulations behind the scenes are started in both camps
 shivasena or bijepi jahaan nirdaleey vidhayakon ko apni ore khinchne kii koshish karti nazar aa rahi hai to vahiin koi bhi party ensipi ke khilaaf nahin bol rahe hai
 Because both parties know that they may need NCP anytime

 Also expressed his opinion about singing lesser songs in Bollywood
 jasbir jassi apane letest single kii lonching ke maukey par pahunche the
 While talking about the songs he has sung less in Bollywood, he said that he gets offers for many songs from Bollywood
 lekin wo gane ke bol or uske saath chipki ashleelata ke chalate is tarah ke geet gane se bachanaa chaahate hai
 Punjabi singer Jasbir Jassi shared these special things: Jassi, who has sung great songs like Long the Lashkara, says that he does not want to refuse Bollywood songs but he is helpless
 aajkal kai saare gane aise ban rahe hai jise ghar main parivaaravaalon ke saath baithkar nahin dekha ja saktaa
 Their lyrics are double meaning or abusive words are used and they want to avoid singing such songs
 unhone aage kaha ki unhen bollywood main gaanaa gane se parhez nahin he
 But they choose a lot of songs
 wo divotional yaa phir solphul song gaanaa chaahate hai
 He has sung Sufi songs less and wants to try his hand at Sufi songs filmed in Bollywood
 wo mahaan gayak jinako jasbir jassi bhagwaan maanate hai
 
 
 Talking about Punjabi music, Jassi said that due to some songs these days the level of Punjabi music is decreasing
 sirf kuch bure kaamon kii vajah se hamaara acha kaam bhi dab jaataa he or uski chamak nikhar kar nahin fail paati he
 Despite this, artists like Guru Randhawa and Diljit have been instrumental in taking Punjabi art and Tehzeeb forward
 chamaki bukhaar se bihar main haahaakaar he
 The death toll of children here is constantly increasing
 rajya main ab tak 152 bacchon kii maut ho chuki he
 130 children have died in Muzaffarpur alone, but for the health minister of the state Mangal Pandey, grief does not even matter
 ek ore sarkari aspataal main bacchon kii maut ho rahi he to vahiin bihar sarkaar main mantri mangal pandey ravivaar ko rajdhani patna main nijee nursing home ke uddhatan main vyast rahe

 During this, Mangal Pandey said that i myself have seen all the arrangements in the nursing home
 mangal pandey ke saath bihar vidhansabha ke adhyaksh vijay choudhary bhi maujuud the
 He also described private hospital as better than government hospital in Bihar
 vijay choudhary ne nijee aspataal ko bihar ke sabase bade sarkari aspataal piemasiech se bhi behatar bataa diya
 There was no time to know the condition of the government hospital
 On Sunday, a part of the roof of Srikrishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) of Muzaffarpur collapsed
 yahaan ke isiu ward main jane vaale raste par achaanak chat kaa plaster tut kar gir padaa
 But the health minister did not notice it
 swasthya mantri mangal pandey ko sarkari aspataalon kaa haal jaanane kii fursat nahin he
 Let us know that children suffering from fever are being treated in this hospital
 aise maukey par jab bihar main chamaki bukhaar se marane vaale bacchon kii maut kaa matam he, tab mangal pandey or vijay choudhary na keval nijee aspataal ke udghaatan main shaamil hue balki us aspataal kii tarifon ke pul bhi baandhne lage
 a few days ago, the Union Health Minister, Dr
 Chawl fever harshavardhan ke saath samiksha baithak chal rahi thi
 More than 100 children had died, but Mangal Pandey was asking the score of the cricket match
 inhen masuumon kii maut ke baad mujffarpur pahunchane main paanch din lag gaye the
 But the opening of the private hospital arrived at exactly the right time
 yahi nahin inhen sarkari aspataalon main jhaankne kii bhale hi fursat nahin mili lekin nijee aspataal kii ek-ek cheez kaa inhone baariki se jayja liya

 com / 8zruimzp2q Tik Tok bain ke baad aisa lagata he ki ab Pubg mobile kaa number he
 It is also a fact that Tik Tok has already demanded a pub ban in many places in India
 isaki vajahen kai hai, kuch ghatnaayen saamne ai hai jisase logon ko lagata he ki ise bain ho janaa chahie
 One thing in Pubg and tiktok is common
 yo donon hi eps china ke hai or desh main teji se popular hue hai
 There are millions of active users and the number of active users of both these apps is increasing rapidly
 taaja maamla rajkot kaa he
 According to media reports, Rajkot police has written a letter to Google, requesting Google to ban PUBG mobile from being downloaded
 rajkot police ne google ko philhal rajkot shahar se ise bain karne ko kaha he
 At present, there is no statement from Google on this police request
 aapako bataa den ki pichley mahineis game ko state home department ke aadesh ke baad band karne kaa faisla liya gaya tha
 Not only this, 10 people were arrested for this, because they were playing PUBG
 iske alaava kai exiaar bhi darj hue hai
 Although the ban was later lifted, the ban is still in force in Rajkot
 rajkot police kamisionar ne first post se kaha he, ‘hamane kaha he ki hamane ise (PUBG) ko bain kar diya he, isliye agar sambhav he to is aria kii ypi adress ke jariye rajkot main is game kii dowloding par bhi roak laga di jaae’is ilaake main pabaji khelte hue pakade jane par logon ko giraftaar bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 This is not the case with tiktok though
 tik tok yuj karne par pabandi kii koi khabar nahin he
 Only Tick Talk has been removed by Google and Apple from its app stores, so that no user can download it to their smartphone
 kul mila kar baat ye he ki agar aane vaale samay main tik tok yuj karne par bhi giraftaar kaa aadesh aa jaae cho koi hairaani vaali baat nahin hogi
 The Olympics have opened on TV, newspaper and social media these days
 soshal media par log apni profile tasveeron kaa rangarup badal kar desh kii olympic team kaa hausala badha rahe hai to vahiin indian olympic kamity ne bhi is baar bhartiya itihaas kii sabase badi team olympix main bheji he
 Despite all this, the news that is coming from Rio's field is going to disappoint
 127 karod kii jansankhya vaala desh olympic ke manch par aise chaaron khaane chitt hota he jaise ki use koi fark hi nahin pad rahaa ho
 Even if a few medals have come somewhere, everyone carries them and pats their back as if someone has shot a big arrow
 soshal media par log aise bihev karenge ki yadi aaj sari duniya ke deshon ke bich dangal kara die jaaen to bharat hi awwal rahegaa, lekin afsos ki yah sab-kuch yatharth kedharataltak nahin pahunch paata
 Now take the matter of wrestling
 pehle-pahal to yahaan ke kushti sanghon main rajanetaaon kii bina vajah dakhlandaji
 Second, instead of reports of mutual cohesion and respect, there are reports of internal involvement in doping, and that too after the Olympic team is selected
 aakhir ham puri duniya ko dikhaanaa kya chaahate hai?lon tennis jais team khelon main koi apane ahm kaa tyaag karne ko taiyaar nahin
 Till the end there was a lot of confusion about who would pair up with whom? Knowing all that he has gained all the fame and wealth through sports, it is only because he has shown the ability to represent the country on any platform in the world
 desh kii maasoom or bholi janata ne palak-paanvade bicha die
 While countries much smaller than ours are winning dozens of medals both in terms of population and area
 vahiin ham abhi blager-kot or dress code kii bahason main hi uljhe hai
 Only in sports like cricket which are played and appreciated in a dozen countries of the world, sometimes they win and sometimes they beat themselves back
 haalanki isamen aisa bhi nahin he ki sari galati aam janata kii he
 In fact, our responsible institutions are not aware of who actually says the responsibility
 athlete or khilaadiyon ko chinhit or taiyaar karne kaa maikenism kya ho?yahaan is maamle main china kaa zikr karnaa praasangik bhi he or jaruri bhi
 China is our neighbor and it would be a matter of one or two decades ago that he did not perform at the Olympics as per his population
 magar aaj kii taarikh main vah america, australia or germany jaise deshon se kandhaa-se-kandhaa ragadata dikhataa he
 The whole world is scared of Chinese dragons
 unhone vahaan tak pahunchane ke liye kisi laffaaji yaa shortkat kaa sahaara nahin liya balki kadi mehnat or state ke dekh-rekh main pasinaa bahaya
 Today, we need to learn from our mistakes and move forward and make honest efforts
 aakhir dusron se to nazren churaana phir bhi aasaan he lekin khud kii najaron se kab tak bachenge? akele main khud ko aaine main kaise dekh paaenge

 By 2018, robbers (a special device) will detect hydrogen on the fog of the moon and a search could be started by 2019-2020

 jharkhand main pradhanmantri kii maujuudagi main vahaan ke mukhyamantri hemanth sorain kii hooting hui
 Earlier this happened in Kaithal with Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda
 ye bhartiya raajnneeti ke nae daur kaa ek or udhaaharan he
 BJP leaders argue that people have anger against Congress
 shaayad 18 siton par hue upachunaav ke nateezon kaa intjaar karnaa chahie ki logon kaa kitna gussa kiske prati he
 It is also true that the BJP as well as the Sangh have strong spirits and as far as the hooting of non-bjp leaders in the Prime Minister's Assembly is concerned, it is the class that becomes a part of any crowd
 yadi yah tay ho ki tivi par shakl aane kii guarantee he, lekin gambhir pahalu yah he ki ek sangheey dhaanche main kaam karte vakt alag-alag dalon ke pradhanmantri or mukhyamantri ek saath manch par aate rahenge
 Yes, the stage can change and face too
 vaise main pradhanmantri ke mukhyamantriyon ke saath milakar kaam karne ke daavon main kitna dam rah jaataa he
 Fearing hooting, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra refused to share the stage with the Prime Minister
 aise main ab pradhanmantri kii pratikriya kaa sabko intjaar rahegaa kyonki kareeb 14 saal tak mukhyamantri rah chuke narendra modi kii bhale hi ab bhoomika badal gai he
 But they know the mindset of a chief minister well
 logon ko abhi yaad hoga ki kis tarah vaajapeyi ne ek mukhyamantri ko rajdharm kii yaad dilaai thi
 But this time all this is being done by the public or say BJP workers
 ek or nai cheez dekhne ko mili ki pradhanmantri ke kisi samaaroh main doordarshan ke alaava ek or vyavastha kii gai thi, jisase sabhi nijee channelon ko feed muhaiyaa karai gai
 Till now it used to be during a party rally and BJP and Congress used it a lot during the election campaign
 jab doordarshan is tarah ke kaaryakramon kaa prasaaran karata rahaa tab is tarah ke shorgul yaa kahen hooting ko pramukhataa se jagah nahin milti thi
 The same thing is seen in the live telecast of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
 khub shorgul ke dauraan sadan kii kaarywahi ke dauraan camera spikar par hi focus rahata he
 But it is a matter of time
 raajnneeti main kaaphi kuch badal rahaa he or badal rahe hai raajnneeti ke myne or saath hi badal jayega hamaare sangheey dhaanche kaa matlab
 Whichever government is at the center talks about a strong center and the states have been accusing them of their rights and discrimination with them
 aise main hooting kii kuch ghatnaon ne jo shuruyaat kii he usamen mukhyamantri ab pradhanmantri kii sabha main jane se kataraa rahe hai or yah dooriyaan paatane kaa nahin badhaane kaa hi kaam karegaa

 Direct Recruitment Cell, Office of Chief Postmaster General, Rajasthan Circle, Sardar Patel Marg, Jaipur- 302007 maujuuda daur main jab muslim samaaj main is baat ko lekar bahes ho rahi he ki kaise unki berogari dur ho or unki jaan-maal kaise salaamat rahe
 In such a situation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned the issue related to Muslims from the ramparts of the Red Fort, which had already covered the sheet of silence
 modi ne 15 agast ke maukey par tripal talaak kaa zikr karke phir se use bahes main laa diya he
 In fact, the BJP gave a lot of air to this issue in the 2017 UP Assembly elections, due to which many Muslims also voted for the BJP
 15 agast ke maukey par lalakile se desh ko sambodhan main narendra modi ne tripal talaak kaa zikr kiya or kaha ki main un maataaon bahanon kaa abhinandan karnaa chahta hum jinhone teen talaak kii vajah se kaaphi mushkil saha
 Despite this, the countrymen and the media also supported the struggle they faced against triple talaq, this created an atmosphere against triple talaq across the country
 hamen unako insaaf dilaanaa he or hindustan unke saath khadaa he
 In such a situation, Modi's plan is clear that the issue of triple talaq should remain alive and the debate goes on continuously
 iske jariye ek maahaul banegaa or sidhaa phayda bijepi ko milegaa
 That is why in the indications Modi made it clear that Muslim women should take part in the triple divorce movement
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 9 agast ko muslim mahila personal lau board kii adhyaksh shysta ambar ne mulaakaat bhi kii thi
 During this, he praised the government's move on the issue of triple talaq
 itani nahin unhone muslim mahilaon ke haq or hukuk kii baat sarkaar ke saamne rakhi thi
 In such a situation, by referring to triple divorce from Lal Qila, Narendra Modi has rekindled this debate in the house of Muslims
 aise main muslim samaaj ab duusare mudde par baat karne ke bajaay phir isi tripal talaak ke mudde par ulajhakar rah jayega
 Because Muslims always get involved in emotional matters on religious matters
 pichley dinon kai muslim mahilaon ne tripal talaak ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaaya
 Not only this, some women even approached the Supreme Court
 iske baad desh bhar main tripal talaak ko lekar lambii bahes hui he
 Discussions on this issue continued from TV channels to seminars
 supreme court main is mudde par har roj sunaavi bhi hui
 While the Modi government presented its stand in the court against triple talaq, the Muslim Personal Law Board said that the matter is a religious matter for Muslims
 aise main sarkaar or court isamen dakhsandaji na kare
 Despite this, there was a hearing in the court, and the decision can come anytime

 Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopananda Saraswati, head of the Dwarkarasarada Peeth, said that the cow is not only the mother of Hindus but also of Muslims, because its milk is as beneficial to those who follow one religion as those who follow another religion
 yahaan ek bayaan main swami swaroopanand ne kaha ki hinduon ko bhi gaay ke doodh se utana hi protein miltaa he jitna muslimon ko
 Therefore it is quite right to say that cow is not only the mother of Hindus but also of Muslims
 unhone kaha ki koi kisi bhi dharm se judaa ho, lekin gaay ko bachaana bharatiyon ke hit main he
 He said that as per the provisions of Indian Constitution, laws have been made against cow slaughter in different parts of the country and there is nothing wrong in this
 tippaniyan He said that laws against cow slaughter were challenged from time to time in the Supreme Court, but such appeals were always rejected
 swaroopanand ne kaha ki gauvadh ke khilaaf kanoon banane ke saath hi iske maance kii bikri par bhi pratibandh hona chahie

 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or unke bete rahul or beti priyanka se espiji suraksha waapas lene par chintaa jataate hue shivasena ne shanivaar ko kaha ki aise maamalon main raajnneetik matbhedon ko alag rakhana chahie or kisi ko bhi kisi kii jindagi se khilwaad nahin karnaa chahie
 The Shiv Sena, which joined hands with Congress and NCP this week to form the government in Maharashtra, asked who in the Union Home Ministry feels the threat to the Gandhi family has reduced
 party ne pradhanmantri narendra modi se bhi anurodh kiya ki vah is maamle par vichaar kare
 Modi is the only person with SPG protection
 centre ne is maheene kii shuruyaat main gandhi parivaar kaa vishesh raksha samooh (espiji) kaa suraksha gheraa hataa diya or iske bajaay unhen siarpief kaa ‘jed plus' suraksha gheraa diya
 The Shiv Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece 'saamana', "whether it is Delhi or Maharashtra, the atmosphere should be fear free
 yah shaskaon kii jimmedaari he ki aisa maahaul paidaa kiya jaae ki log bhay mukt tareeke se kaam kar saken
 When such an environment is created, there will be no objection to the removal of the security ring
 sampadakeey main kaha gaya he, ‘lekin pradhanmantri, grih mantri, mantri or sattarudh party ke anya netaa apana suraksha gheraa hataane ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 The importance of bulletproof vehicles has also not diminished
 iskaa matlab he ki gandhi parivaar kii suraksha ko lekar uthaae ja rahe sawaalon kaa kuch to aadhaar he
 The Shiv Sena said, 'the news of deployment of old vehicles in the Gandhi family convoy is also worrying
 agar khatre kii ghanti baj rahi he to pradhanmantri ko is maamle par vichaar karnaa chahie
 "referring to the removal of President's rule at night in Maharashtra last Saturday, the Shiv Sena said that the Amit Shah-led ministry also felt that bjp's Devendra Fadnavis had a majority in the state but" the truth was different "
 '
 fadanvis ne NCP ke ajit pavaar ke saath gat shanivaar ko maharashtra main sarkaar banaai thi lekin pavaar ke ‘nijee vajahon' se istife ke baad yah sarkaar mahaj 80 ghante hi chali
 The Shiv Sena said, "so there are still doubts about the Gandhi family becoming less of a threat
 'shivasena ne 1984 or 1991 main gandhi parivaar ke divangat purv pradhanmantriyon kramash: indira or unke bete rajeev gandhi kii hatyaon ko bhi yaad kiya jiske baad gandhi parivaar ko espiji suraksha di gai thi
 The party said that when the indo-sri Lanka peace deal was signed in 1987, the late Shiv Thackeray, the founder of the Shiv Sena, also spoke of the danger to Rajiv Gandhi's life
 party ne kaha, ‘sarkaar ko lag saktaa he ki sab kuch thik he lekin kuch maheene pehle colombo hotel main bam dhamaakaa hua
 Shiv Sena said, "there can be political differences with the Congress or the Gandhi family
 pichley paanch varshon main nehru parivaar ke saath takaraav bad gaya he lekin kisi ko bhi kisi kii jindagi se khilwaad nahin karnaa chahie
 She said that she would have expressed similar views even if there was someone other than the Gandhi family

 ) bhartiya cricket board se aaajeevan pratibandhit hone ke baavjood purv ipel ayukta lalit modi ne 19 disambar ko hone vaale rajasthan cricket sangh ke chunaavon ke liye somvaar ko apana namakan bhar diya jiske baad bisisiai ne aaarasie ko hi nilambit karne kii dhamkee de daali
 Modi's nomination papers for the post of RCA president were submitted by his lawyer Mahmood Abdi
 abdi ne guuruuvaar ko hone vaale chunaavon ke liye swayan upaadhyaksh pad ke liye namakan bharaa he
 Abdi was also accompanied by Amin Pathan, secretary of Kota District Cricket Association and close to Modi
 unke namakan patron kii kal jaanch kii jaaegi jabaki 18 disambar ko subah 11 se dopaher do baje tak naam waapas liya ja saktaa he
 The BCCI, however, has written a letter to the current RCA chairman CP Joshi, who decided not to contest
 bisisiai sachiv sanjay patel ne patr main likhaa he, 'hamane paaya ki nagaur cricket sangh ne lalit modi ko adhyaksh ke rup main anumati di he
 We would like to inform you that as per the BCCI rules and guidelines, all the members including RCA will have to follow the decisions issued in the interest of BCCI, especially the decisions and guidelines related to the disciplinary process
 ' He said, "RCA may lose BCCI membership if one of your district units retains a BCCI dismissed administrator
 isliye kripaya bisisiai dishanirdeshon kaa paalan karen or hamen is bare main report den
 ' modi ko ipel ayukta ke taur par vittiya gadabadiyon kaa doshi paaya gaya tha, jisase bisisiai ne par un par bharat main cricket sambandhi masalon main hissaa lene se pratibandhit kar diya tha, lekin aktubar main rajasthan ucch nyaayalay ne unke nilamban par roak laga di thi
 Modi's lawyer claimed that RCA comes under the Rajasthan Sports Act and therefore the bcci's ban does not apply to this former vice-chairman of the board
 abdi ne namakan bharne ke baad kaha, 'suraksha kaarnon se ham kuch samay ke liye unhen yahaan nahin dekh paaenge, lekin vah chunaav lard sakate hai
 ' abdi se poocha gaya ki yadi modi chunaav jeet jate hai to kya unki anupasthiti main aaarasie kaa kaamkaaj chalaaya ja sakegaa, unhone kaha, 'unke har samay yahaan upasthiti karne kii jarurat nahin he
 He has a team under him that can work under his leadership
 yahaan tak ki si pi joshi bhi har samay karyaalay main upasthit nahin karte the
 Actually we are calculating the number of days he came to office
 ' Significantly, BJP Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje brought the Sports Act to clear the way for Modi in the 2005 elections
 ab jab raaje phir se rajasthan kii mukhyamantri ban gayi hai to lagata he ki modi ke liye bhi paanv jamaane kaa rasta khul gaya he

 ham ab tak bhi bisisiai ko lagaataar manaate rahe ki uchit anupaat main atirikt boli raashi ko lautaa diya jaae
 It was denied on the basis of strict rules
 bayaan ke mutabik, ‘toornament ke hit main ham lagaataar bisisiai ko khilaadiyon kii khuli nilaamee ke liye manaate rahe jisase ki samanta ho or sabhi tiimon ko khilaadiyon kii gunvattta ke najariye se barabari ke maukey milen
 Again this was repeatedly denied under strict BCCI rules
 hamen swaabhaavik nyaay se vanchit kiya gaya
 The 12 best players were then retained by the already existing teams
 'isamen kaha gaya he ki do nayi tiimon ne iske baad kam se kam ek atirikt videshi khilaadi rakhane kii sweekruti dene kaa aagrah kiya lekin niyamon kaa hawala dete hue isse bhi inkaar kar diya gaya
 Sahara's top player in the IPL is captain Yuvraj Singh, who is currently recovering from a lung tumor
 ipel ke is satr main yuvaraj kii anuplabdhta par sahaara ne bisisiai se is ballebaaj kii keemat ko uski khilaadiyon kii nilaamee kii raashi main jodne ke liye kaha tha lekin unke is nivedan ko bhi thukraa diya gaya
 It states that Yuvraj Singh is like a member of our family and unfortunately he is going through a bad phase in health and undergoing treatment for serious illness abroad
 company ne kaha ki uskaa dhyaan rakhana hamaari jimmedaari he isliye sahaara ne is saal uski puri fees kaa bhugtan karne kaa faisla kiya he lekin ek shart ke saath ki swasthya laabh uski praathamikta rahe or vah puri tarah se ubar jane tak nahin khele
 The statement said that we had requested the BCCI that on the basis that we had only one top Indian player, therefore allow Yuvraj Singh's price to be added to our auction amount during the February 4 auction because later we did Sourav Ganguly was bought for four million dollars
 isamen kaha gaya ki niyamon ke aadhaar par ek baar phir isse inkaar kar diya gaya
 Once again we were denied natural justice
 hamen lagata he ki yuvaraj singh kii sthiti kaa niyamon main zikr nahin kyonki sambhavat: isamen sirf khilaadiyon kii asthai chot ke bare main kaha gaya he
 Sahara was also unhappy that Bangalore was also allowed to buy substitute player Chris Gayle this season
 company ke ek adhikari ne naam jaahir nahin karne kii shart par bataaya ki gail ko jis tarah se kharida gaya vah sahaara sahit kai frenchygiyon ko pasand nahin aayaa
 Sahara said that Mumbai, who suffered injuries during the Champions League T20, was allowed to field an additional foreign player due to the team's woes but the attitude towards Pune was never shown
 bayaan ke mutabik, ‘hamen lagata he ki ekatarfa bhavuk rishte ko ab aage nahin badhaayaa ja saktaa
 We are withdrawing from all types of cricket under BCCI
 ’ company ne haalanki kaha ki vah agle kuch maheenon tak praayojan raashi kaa bhugtan karegi jisase ki bisisiai ko nayaa praayojak dhundne kaa samay mil jaae
 It also promised to pay staff to its IPL players
 company ne kaha, ‘ham bisisiai ke liye koi samasya khadi nahin karnaa chaahate or hamen lagata he ki khilaadiyon ko mushkil nahin honi chahie
 It will take two to four months for BCI to find a new sponsor and till then we will continue to pay sponsorship money
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘sabhi anya ipel team ke khilaadiyon, kochon or is tarah jude anya logon ko agar khilne mauka nahin miltaa he to unhen is saal unka bhugtan nishchit taur par milegaa
 Sahara also said that he was also unhappy that his logo was removed from the team's shirt at the icc's instructions in the 2003 World Cup and some other tournaments
 bisisiai ke antargat cricket se hatane ke baad sahaara ne kaha ki vah ek hajaar karod welfare foundation main lagayegaa
 The company said, "we are happy to decide that the money invested in cricket will now be used for social work
 ham desh ke pratishthit logon ke sahyog se chalane vaali sahaara welfare foundation main turant 500 karod rupee daalane kii ghoshnaa karte hai
 Sahara declares that another 500 crore rupees will be added to it in the next one to two years according to the need of the programs
 ’bayaan main kaha gaya, ‘bisisiai ke saath lagaataar jari baatcheet ke do farvari 2012 ko vifal hone ke baad hamane yah faisla kiya lekin hamane nilaamee ke din tak intjaar kiya ki bisisiai ko kiya gaya hamaara nivedan maan liya jaae lekin ek baar phir swaabhaavit nyaay nahin hua
 Sahara said that he 20 villagers
 chote shaharon main khel prachaar kendron kaa vikaas karegaa jisamen gramin
 Cricket promotion centers of small cities are also included
 company ne kaha, ‘kendron main vividh khel jaise cricket, haaki, saakar, formula van, tennis, golf, kushti, mukkebaaji aadi honge
 An international level sports academy should also be developed immediately for India
 sabhi chune gaye sarvshereshth chaatro ko antat: is antarrashtriya str kii khel academy main jagah milegi
 Sahara also announced that an aid fund will also be created for those aged and current sportspersons who are facing medical expenses, daughters' marriage, building problems etc
 prayek saal kam se kam 10 karod baante jaaenge jisamen se teen karod cricketron or saat karod baaki khelon main die jaaenge
 Regardless of whether you are in a long-term relationship or you have a new love affair, avoid commenting on your partner that 'you have gained weight' or 'you should not eat that much
 
 
 'apane partner kii fitness ke bare main baat karte samay shabdon ke chayan par vishesh dhyaan den
 huffingtonpost
 com ke mutabik ye kuch aise shabd hai, jinka istemaal aapako apane partner ke liye nahin karnaa chahie:'tumhaara vajan bad gaya he'vajan kaa badhanaa sirf khaane se sambandhit nahin hota he
 There are some health issues that cause weight gain
 jaise thyroid kii vajah se vajan badhata he
 In addition, emotional eating is another reason for weight gain
 to jab bhi aapke partner kaa vajan badha ho, aap usase ye poochne kii jagah 'kya tum thik ho?' bhi puch sakate hai
 'you should not eat this' If your partner is also eating unhealthy snacks, then do not tell him directly that' You should not eat this
 
 
 ' is tarah ke coment se bachein or usko anheldi snacks khaane se rokane ke liye use kuch healdi food ofer kariye
 So, in this way you can make your partner happy as well as show your concern about his health

 " Savitri river fishes are not getting buyers after the accident caused by the fall of the Savitri river bridge in Mahad in Raigad district of Maharashtra

 Fishermen's occupation: Two ST buses and a Tavera train were washed away in the accident caused by the Savitri river copulgir last month

 Among the submerged people, the bodies of 27 people were found, while some others were not
 mili hui laashen kaaphi chhin-binn avasthaa main thim
 Fishes in the river and other animals may have eaten these corpses, locals believe that, so people are shying to buy the fish of this river
 isi kaaran savitri nadi semchaliyanpakadaney waalon kaa vyavsaay thap ho gaya he
 According to the local people of Mahad who come to buy fish in Machhi Bazaar, the food of the people of the river has reduced
 mahaad fish market ke dukandaaron kaa kahana he ki logo ke man main dharna ho gai he ki durghatnagrast logon kaa maas in machhaliyon ne khaaya he, isliye ye ashubh he
 Sushma Satpute, SDO of Alibaug Collector Kacheri, told in a phone conversation with Aaj Tak that according to him, it was a case of blind faith

 For most girls, going to the parlor means just threading
 threading karwaanaa sabase saamaanya cheez he
 Some girls set eyebrows at home with the help of plucker but this causes great damage to the skin
 par is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki threading karwaanaa ek dardanaak prakriya he
 In which many times there are tears from eyes to tears
 kuch logon kii twachaa to itani komal hoti hai ki ibro banavaane ke dauraan unhen khun aane kii bhi shikaayat ho jaati he
 But if you want, you can ease this pain by adopting the remedy with ease, but one thing that is to be kept in mind is that in the parlor where you have been making eyebrows till now, always get it done
 is tarah ibro banavaane vaali ladki yaa ladke kaa haath aapke anusaar set ho jayega jisase dard kam hoga or shape bhi sahi rahegi
 Follow these steps to avoid the pain of threading: 1
 threading karwaane ke baad moishcharizer yaa koi kriim jarur lagaaein
 With its use, the skin gets warmth as well as comfort
 2
 If you have a toner, you can also use it
 3
 If you don't have any of these products, don't worry
 aap chahen to prabhavit jagah par barf bhi ragad sakati hai
 This reduces stretch
 4
 If you have a lot of pain during threading, then you can already apply toothpaste with mint in that place
 5
 It will be beneficial for you to use powder before threading
 isse twachaa mulaayam ho jaati he jisase bal aasaani se nikal jate hai
 Along with these measures, also keep in mind that eyebrows did not grow very much
 bal jitne bade ho jaaenge, utana hi adhik dard hoga

 Let me tell you that Mehul Choksi, the second accused of PNB scam and a relative of Nirav Modi, is currently in Antigua
 usne isi saal janvari ke maheene main antigua kii naagarikta lee thi
 Mehul Choksi submitted his passport to the Indian High Commission in Antigua in January
 mehul chokasee ne bhi antigua main nivesh kaa bahaanaa banaakar vahaan kii naagarikta lee thi
 Indian agencies are continuously pursuing legal action in Antigua for the extradition of Mehul Choksi
 isi dauraan jab antigua kii sarkaar ko neerav modi dwaara naagarikta ke liye aavedan mila to unke kaan khadey ho gaye
 Officials of conscious Antigua immediately informed this to Indian authorities, followed by objections from Indian angels, currently Antigua has rejected Nirav Modi's citizenship application
 bataa den ki neerav modi ko 19 march main landan main giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 After this, his extradition case is going on in a London court

 Former legendary player Erapalli Prasanna, who was part of one of the best spin attack of the game, has named India's current bowling group as the best in the last 60 to 70 years
 bharat ke 7 gendbaajon ke akraman main 5 tej gendbaaj shaamil hai, jinamein se 4 niyamit taur par 140 kimi prati ghanta kii raftaar se gendbaaji karte hai or yahi kaaran he ki prasanna chaahate hai ki viraat kohli dakshin africa ke khilaaf pehle test main paanch gendbaajon ke saath utren
 Prasanna told PTI, "india has one of the best attacks in the world
" mujhe to lagata he ki maujuuda team jaisaa akraman to pehle kabhi tha hi nahin
 This is probably the best i have seen in the last 60–70 years
 ’ prasanna ne kaha ki maujuuda akraman ko dekhte hue bharat ko antim ekadash main 5 gendbaajon ke saath utarana chahie
 If they want to win, then 5 bowlers are necessary so the Indian team is likely to land in the first match with 3 fast bowlers and a spinner
 prasanna ne kaha, ‘meraa hameshaa se maananaa he ki agar aapako jeetna he, to 5 gendbaaj jaruri hai
 The logic of feeding extra batsmen also applies to bowlers
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘agar aap atirikt ballebaaj khilaate bhi ho, to bhi ek yaa do hi bada score khadaa karte hai
 Chances are if the top 5 failed then the sixth would also fail
 ’worne-kumble-murali ke baad africa main nahin chalaa kisi spinner kaa jaadoobharat ne team main 5 visheshgy tej gendbaajon ko chunaa he jisamen eshanth sharma, umesh yadav, mohammad shami or bhubaneshwar kumaar ke alaava jasprit bumraah ko pehali baar team main jagah di gai he
 Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja are two spinners, but there is every possibility that only one of them will play in the first Test
 prasanna ne kaha ki aisi sthiti main aswin pehle test main khilne ke prabal daavedaar honge
 He also refused to compare the two teams, saying that India has a good chance of winning the first Test series in South Africa

 The trial court adjourned till Monday the bail plea of an 11-year-old Christian child arrested under the blasphemy law in Pakistan
 nyaayadhish mohammad ajam khan kii adaalat ne is maamle kii sunwaayee sthagit karte hue police ko nirdesh diya ki bacchee kii ore se jamaanat yachika daayar karne vaale kii jaanch karen
 The court gave this direction when the prosecution questioned that the bail petition did not have the signature of the girl or her mother
 website 'aljajira' ke mutabik is maamle main adaalat ne shuukravaar ko sunwaayee karte hue bacchee ko do saptaah tak sudhaar grih main rakhane kaa aadesh diya tha
 The court said that until the police do a full investigation and decide whether to accuse or not accuse the girl, she should be kept in a correctional home
 bacchee ke vakil taahir navid choudhary ne abhiyojan paksh par maamle ko latakaane kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki chikitsa report main bacchee ko naaballig paaya gaya or uskaa aikyuu str par kam he, aise main vah ishaninda kaise kar sakati he
 After the arrest of the girl under the blasphemy law, there has been a lot of criticism across the country and the world
 maanavadhikaar sanghathanon ne bhi aise kanoon kii ninda kii he
 It is notable that the child is accused of insulting the Quran and setting fire to a copy of it
 bataaya gaya he ki bacchee kii dimagi haalat thik nahin he lekin uske paas mili quran ke kuch jaale pannon ko dekh log bhadak gaye or police par karrwai ke liye dabaav banaaya
 Some reports in the local media also said that the girl was taking out paper from the trash for cooking and at the same time someone came and started accusing her of burning Quran pages
 bacchee kis beemaari se peedit he is bare main adhikariyon ne kuch bhi nahin bataaya he lekin kuch khabaron main kaha gaya he ki vah douns syndrome naam kii beemaari se peedit he
 Significantly, the blasphemy law in Pakistan is very stringent and from time to time there has been a demand for improvement
 is kanoon ke tahat quran ko apavitra karne ke liye umr kaid kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan he
 In cases of defiling the Quran, the crowd here violently kills the blasphemer
 is kanoon main badlaav kii maang karne vaale netaaon ko apni maut se iskaa khamiyaja bhugatna padaa he vah chaahe alpsankhyak maamalon ke mantri shahabaaz bhatti hon yaa phir punjab ke governor salmaan taasir
 LJP supremo and Union Food and Public Distribution Minister Ram Vilas Paswan have quipped on the candidature of Bihar Chief Minister and JDU National President Nitish Kumar as Prime Minister
 shanivaar ko unhone kaha ki nitish apane munh miyaan mitthu ban rahe hai
 There is no vacancy for the post of PM for the next 15 years, then where will the place be made for Nitish
 sanghmukt bharat kii apil par ghire nitishanithish ne aresas kii vichaardhaara ko desh or samaaj ko baantne vaale bataate hue ‘sangh mukt’ bharat kaa aahwan kiya tha
 Along with this, he also appealed the non-bjp parties to unite before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 iske baad un par chaaron taraf se jubaani hamale tej ho gaye hai
 Sharad Pawar jokingly endorsed Nitish: On a question about NCP chief Sharad Pawar's support for Nitish's candidature for the Prime Minister's post, Paswan said that Pawar has said these things, taking it lightly, but not in sanity
 unhone kaha ki agle 15 saal tak pradhanmantri pad ke liye rikti nahin he
 Because Narendra Modi will continue in this post and no face can stand before him
 dhyaan bhatakaane ke liye sharabbandi or secular ektakendriya mantri ne aarope lagaaya ki nitish bihar main apni sarkaar kii vifaltaa se logon kaa dhyaan hataane ke liye sharabbandi ko lekar rashtriya abhiyaan chhedane or dharmanirpeksh dalon ko ekajute karne kii baat kar rahe hai
 On RJD chief Lalu Prasad's endorsement of Nitish's candidature for the post of Prime Minister, Paswan said that he does not know about his game plan but what has gone with him, has he been able to flourish? But think Nitish Kumar, he said that Pawar's party has six mps, Lalu has three mps and Nitish's party JDU has two mps
 kya itane hi saansadon kii madad se vepradhanmantriban jaaenge
 Also who is supporting them
 unki sarkaar main sahyogi congress ke liye rahul gandhi hi ummidavaar ho sakate hai
 Why Nitish is qualified then why opposition in allies Paswan said that if Nitish is qualified then why is Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and Congress opposing him
 unhone kaha ki dharmanirpeksh dal pehle apane bich tay kar len kiraahul gandhi,nitish kumaar, mulaayam singh yadav, jai lalita, mamata banerjee or naveen patnayak main se koun pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar honge
 PM Modi will be the only leader of NDA When asked about his candidature for the post of Prime Minister, Paswan said that we are in NDA and our only leader is Narendra Modi
 aage bhi vahiin hamaare netaa rahenge
 When the leader of the NDA constituent Hindustani Awam Morcha Vrishan Patel arrived, when asked if things had increased regarding the merger between ldp-hum secular-rlsp, he denied that he had come to meet us
 algepi, ham-secular or araspi sabhi endie main hai or aage bhi bane rahenge

 a major accident of a cement factory in Narsinghgarh village in Damoh district would have remained hidden if the Human Rights Commission did not take cognizance of it
 is haadase main 40 majdoor laapata hue or durghatana ke baad nirmaan sthal se 300 se zyada mazdooron ko bhaga diya gaya
 After treating only a few injured, the factory management along with the administration is completely suppressing it as an accident
 narsinghgarh gaanv main mysem cement kaa plant he
 The plant has been purchased from Diamond Cement and taken over by Heidelberg, a multinational company
 narsinghgarh plant kii utpaadan kshamta 4,000 ton pratidin kii he or ab ise badhaakar 9,000 ton karne ke liye plant kaa vistaar kiya ja rahaa he
 L&T and IOK companies are doing this construction work together
 isi vistaar sthal par 23 november ko rosemara kii tarah kaam chal rahaa tha
 a massive duct of pre-heater tower was being lifted from a 450-tonne crane weighing crane at the construction site at around 5
30 pm
 yah duct jameen se kareeb chalis meter upar thi
 Around two hundred laborers were working at the construction site during that time
 achaanak yah duct upar se neeche giri or paas main khadi duusari 250 ton kii kraine se takaraai or vahaan kaam kar rahe 40 se zyada mazdooron ke upar gir padi
 In this accident both the cranes were broken, as well as the huge duct was broken, which fell directly on the workers
 maukey par dhul kaa vishaal gubaar uthaa or cheekh-pukaar much gai
 As soon as the accident happened, the management immediately started pressing it
 sabase pehle bijli supplai band kar di gai
 Meanwhile, the news was already in the town and many people reached near the plant, but no one was allowed inside
 damoh ke colector shivanand dube or espi di
 K
 arya pahunche to unhen bhi baahar khadey rahanaa padaa
 Later they went inside
 prabandhan keval kuch logon ke ghayal hone kii baat kahata rahaa
 S
, senior manager of the plant at the time of the incident
 ke
 Gupta said that there were only a few laborers as most of the people had left due to the end of the shift
 isamen se bhi saat mazdooron ko chot ai he
 Injury S
 of the plant
 ke
 Pandey says that no workers have died in the accident
 durghatana ke baad maukey se kisi kaa shav nahin mila he
 The injured are being treated
 yah ek haadasa he, jo kraine kii takneekee kharabi ke kaaran hua he
 The laborers working here came from Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Kerala
 durghatana ke baad shramikon ke gharon main taale latake hai kyonki company ne sabhi mazdooron ko narsinghgarh se bhaga diya he
 This is the reason why nothing is known about the missing laborers
 mapra police kii forensik team ne durghatana sthal se khun ke namoonay liye hai
 To hide the accident, the factory management immediately sprayed the places where there were blood spots
 duct ke toote hisse, jisamen khun laga hua tha, vahaan par taaja rang dekha ja saktaa he
 If the matter did not reach the Human Rights Commission, the matter would have been subdued
 ayog ne fouran 40 mazdooron ke laapata hone kii khabar kaa sangyaan lete hue rajya sarkaar ko chah hafte main report dene ke liye kaha he
 Only after this order, Collector Dubey has currently issued orders for a magisterial inquiry into the accident
 jaanch damoh ke esadm manoj thakur karenge
 The police also immediately filed a criminal case, but the whole plan is to shatter the crane operator Suresh
 police ne kraine oparator suresh, ioki companythatha duty par tainaat karmchaariyon ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya he
 Despite this, some questions have not been answered yet
 jaise durghatana ke baad plant main bijli gaayab karke andhera kyon kiya gaya? factory prabandhan ne tark diya he ki kraine tuutane se bijli supplai baadhit ho gai thi lekin bijli do ghante gaayab rahi
 When no one was killed, why was the Collector and SP not allowed to go in immediately? Not only this, the workers were banished from the village, so that they could not inform anyone
 yahi vajah he ki 40 laapata mazdooron kii jaankaree nahin mil paa rahi
 Even the register showing the presence of laborers is not available
 sabase badi baat yah ki duct ke toote hisse par jahaan khun laga hua tha, turant rang-rogan kyon kar diya gaya? isse yahi lag rahaa he ki durghatana ko ek haadasa bataakar sachaai ko chipaaya ja rahaa he

 com / mcstu2jdcm Nations facing severe threats due to the heat of climate change boycotted the Copenhagen summit talks today, led by the tiny island nation Tuvalu, as their compulsive stringent legal proposals on global warming were ignored
 global varming ke kaaran apane rashtron ke astitv ke sankat kaa saamana kar rahe in deshon ne prashanth mahaasaagar main sthit tuvaalu ke netritv main bahishkaar kaa jhanda buland kiya
 Tuvalu and other small island nations lower than sea level will be the first to submerge when sea level rises, and they proposed an amendment to the United Nations Climate Treaty to keep temperature rise above pre-industrial levels by one and a half degrees
 sammelan kii adhyaksh or denmark ke konni hedeguard ne is prastaav par aage kii karrwai se inkaar kar diya kyonki tel utpaadak deshon sahit kuch deshon ne is prastaav par aapatti jataai thi

 yuanessi ke 21 farvari, 2019 main bhi safataur se yah kaha gaya he ki aatankwaad antarrashtriya shanti or suraksha ke liye sabase gambhir khatra he or iske liye jimmedaar logon ko nyaay ke katghare main laana hoga
 Describing the air strike to be carried out in Pakistan, Rajiv Chander said, "the Indian government is fully committed to take all necessary measures to combat the menace of terrorism
" 26 farvari ko bharat ne jo gaiyr sainya purv rakshaatmak karrwai kii he, uskaa vishesh taur par nishaanaa jaish-e-mohammad kaa shivi tha
 In the selection of this target, care was taken that the common citizens should not suffer any harm
 bharat baar-baar pakistan se yah anurodh karata rahaa he ki vah jaish-e-mohammad ke khilaaf karrwai kare or use pakistan ke bheetar jihadiyon ko prashikshan dene se roke
 The government of Pakistan also promised in January 2014 that it would not allow its land to be used for terrorist attacks against India
 hamen ummid he ki pakistan apane is vaayade ko puraa karegaa or jaish-e-mohammad ke anya sabhi shiviron ko nasht karte hue isse jude aatankiyon ko pakadega
 'it is worth mentioning that on the 13th day of the martyrdom of 40 soldiers in the Pulwama terror attack, IAF Jambans carried out an air strike in Pakistan and pok in many places
