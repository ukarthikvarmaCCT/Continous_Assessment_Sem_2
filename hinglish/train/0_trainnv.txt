 Actually Captain Amarinder Singh has come to power during the Punjab Assembly elections by promising "every house job" to the youth of Punjab

 don news ke mutabik ikbaal ne apane bayaan main kaha ki sipiisi dakshin or madhya asia, pashchimi or africa deshon ko aarthik galiyare ke madhyam se bhugolic taur par jodne ke liye ek manch uplabdh karaayega
 CPEC, costing US $ 50 billion, will pass through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir pok, on which India has conveyed its opposition to China
 isamen siachin glacier samet karakoram parvat shrinkhalaa kaa kshetra bhi shaamil hoga
 India has been a staunch critic of CPEC and believes that the project violates its sovereignty as it is undergoing POK
 america raksha mantri james mattis ne pichley hafte kaha tha ki sipiisi vivaadit kshetra se gujarata he or america is tathy kii andekhi nahin kar saktaa
 However, Iqbal said that America's concern about CPEC is unfounded
 ikbaal yahaan johns hopkins skool of advanced international studies main mukhya vaktaa the
 He said, 'it will benefit everyone and is a platform that will provide a platform to connect South and Central Asia, Western and African countries geographically through the economic corridor
 isliye meraa maananaa he ki america ko sipiisi ko bharat ke nazariye se nahin dekhnaa chahie, balki ise kshetra main shanti, sthirataa or samrudhta ke strot ke taur par dekhnaa chahie
 'CPEC can bring much-needed stability to the region which has been affected by the war for the past several decades
 unhone kaha, agar america is kshetra ko bharat ke nazariye se dekhegaa to isse kshetra ke saath hi america hiton ko bhi nuksaan hoga
 It is therefore important that America should see this situation from an independent perspective, not from someone else's perspective

 However, after becoming Prime Member, those who have recharged 303 will get this off for the next three months
 jinhone sirf 99 rupee yaa 99+149 rupayo kaa richarge karaayaa tha unhen ye ofer nahin milegaa
 Can now become a prime member, users Jio made the last date of becoming a prime member on 15 April
 lekin is faisle ke baad se Jio yujarpub prime member ban sakate hai yaa nahin yah saaf nahin he
 However, the company has said in its statement that it will be finished soon
 reports ke mutabik company ne prime membership lene kii aakhri taarikh nahin ghatai he
 So it is possible that people can register for Prime Membership for one or two days
 agar nahin hua to jaahir he aapako Jio ke saadhaaran tarriff se hi santosh karnaa hoga

 When the jailor is sold
 dipti jailer bik gaya ho
 Every single policeman in the jail has been sold
 to apradhi jail se phone par apane gavaah ko dhamkaaen to aashcharya nahin hona chahie
 The influence of these criminals within the jail is worth seeing
 ve jail ke bheetar se apana hukum chalaate hai
 Prison officials buy
 darasal, ye video raibareli jail kii barrack number 10 main band sangeen jurm ke aropiyon kaa he
 In which it can be seen clearly how these vicious criminals play with weapons inside the jail
 kaise sharaab cigarette kii party karte hai
 How do these policemen buy
 ab aapako bataate hai ki ye aaropee hai koun
 The main organizer of the party is Anshu Dixit, a professional criminal
 haal hi main lakhanu vishvavidhyalay main chaatr netaa vinod treepathi kii hatya ke maamle main uskaa naam saamne aada tha
 Apart from that, Ajit Choubey, Singar Singh, Sohrab and Nikhil Sonkar are seen in the video
 in sab par sitapur, lakhimpur, lakhanu, hardoi, pratapgarh or elahabaad main lut or hatya ke kai maamle darj hai
 This means that they are not dangerous, but are dangerous criminals
 vijeeo main ye jis apradhi ram chander tiwari kii baat kar rahe hai
 He is the deputy jailer of this jail
 ye jis jailer ko paise dene kii baat kar rahe hai, uskaa naam govind verma he
 And the rest of the people who are talking about getting these goods include Jail chief warden Lalta Prasad and warden Shivamangal Singh
 ye video saamne aayaa, viral hua to police kii neend ud gai
 The phase of action started in a hurry
 dm ne chapa maaraa, to mobile phone, tamanchey, sharaab kii bottlen, cigarette maachis, sab baraamad hua
 DIG Jail Umesh Kumar himself arrived for investigation
 jaanch main aarope sach sabit hue or phir shuru hua karrwai kaa daur
 In the name of action, 6 people including SSP, Jailor and Deputy Jailor were suspended
 police waalon par karrwai hui
 The accused were shifted to another jail
 magar jis tarah se jail kii ye tasviren saamne ai hai, usase sabit hota he ki bagpat jail main munna bajrangi jaise apradhi kii hatya ho jane ke baad bhi upi police ne koi sabak nahin liya
 Now even though action has been taken, but this video has revealed that whichever government is in UP, if the culprits are guilty, then jail in UP also leads to paradise

 shrinkhalaa ke 2-2 se baraabar hone ke baad bharat ravivaar ko dakshin africa ke khilaaf hone vaale paanchaven or antim ekadivasiy cricket match se purv apni ballebaaji kii khaamiyon ko dur karne kii koshish karegaa jisase ki vah dakshin africa kii dharti par pehali ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa jeetne main safal rahe
 India have never won an ODI series in South Africa and Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his young team will leave no stone unturned to achieve this feat at the Super Sport Park here
 lekin bharat kii raah aasaan nahin hogi
 In the fourth ODI, the hosts showed a 48-run victory in the duckworth-lewis method and said that they would not let the series slip away without a hard fight
 johanisburg or durban main lagaataar do shikast ke saath 1-2 se pichhadane ke baad dakshin africa neshuukravaar ko port elizabeth main joardaar vaapasi karte hue shrinkhalaa baraabar kar di
 However, India will be worried about their batting before the decisive match as their middle order collapsed once again yesterday
 yuva viraat kohli ke alaava anya ballebaaj lay hasil karne main vifal rahi he jabaki sachin tendulkar ke alaava virendra sahvaag or gautam gambhir kii salaami jodi choton se jujh rahi he
 Kohli scored his second half-century of the series at St George's Park yesterday but his unbeaten 87-ball 92 was insufficient to give the team a win in the fourth ODI
 maujuuda shrinkhalaa main bhartiya ballebaaji ummiido par khari nahin utar pai he or captain dhoni, yuvaraj singh or suresh raina jaise ballebaaj acchhee shuruuaat ko badi pari main badalane main naakaam rahe hai
 Opening is the biggest reason for Dhoni's concern
 rohit sharma sheersh kram main lagaataar vifal rahe hai jabaki kharaab farm se jujhe rahe murali vijay kii jagah pichley match main khilne vaale parthiv patel apni chhap chhodane main vifal rahe
 Looking at the World Cup starting next month, in addition to winning the series, India would like young players to show their strength on the fast pitches of South Africa which have done well recently
 yuvaraj or raina ko kal jimmedaari dikhaani hogi jabaki dhoni ko bhi balle se upyogi yogadan dena hoga
 After failing to win the series with the fourth ODI, Dhoni also admitted that the middle order needed to perform better
 unhone kaha, ‘kohli kii ballebaaji hamaare liye sakaaratmak cheez he
 It is good for us to be at number three
 vah ant tak tikaa rahaa lekin anya ballebaajon ko bhi yogadan dena hoga
 The middle order has failed to contribute fruitfully
 ’ bhartiya gendbaajon ne haalanki ab tak shrinkhalaa main acha pradarshan kiya he
 But the performance of the top bowlers in the fourth match may have added to Dhoni's concern
 kal ashish nehra ke alaava koi bhi sheersh gendbaaj wicket hasil nahin kar sakaa jabaki kaamchalau spinner yuvaraj singh ne teen wicket chatkaye
 The pace bowling pair of Zaheer Khan and Munaf Patel and Harbhajan Singh proved costly but captain Dhoni would hope that this trio will be able to make an impact in the decider
 team ke liye haalanki yuvaraj, raina, rohit sharma or yusuf pathan jaise kamchalau gendbaajon ne acha pradarshan kiya he
 On the other hand, after equalizing the series at Port Elizabeth, South Africa has gained confidence and will do everything possible to prevent India from winning the series on their own
 pehle do maichon main captain greem smith ne balle se upyogi yogadan diya jabaki baaki do maichon main jepi dumini ne dakshin africa ko sankat se ubaara
 He played a key role in the team's victory in the fourth ODI
 is shrinkhalaa main dakshin africa ke gendbaaj kaaphi safal rahe hai
 a trio of Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Lonwabo Tsotsobe have brought wickets to the team, while Johan Botha has managed to rein in the run pace in the middle overs
 dakshin africa ke liye kal robin petersan ne gend or balle donon se upyogi yogadan diya or team ko ek baar phir unase achche pradarshan kii ummid hogi
 Teams: India: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Murali Vijay, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Yusuf Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel, Ashish Nehra, s Sreesanth, Ishant Sharma, Among r Ashwin, Piyush Chawla and Parthiv Patel
 dakshin africa:greem smith :captain:, hashim amala, johaan botha, abi divilliars, jepi dumini, phalf du plasis, imran taahir, colin ingram, david miller, wain parnell, robin petersan, del sten or lonawabo sotsobe main se

 ' Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan got the support of the Shiv Sena in the ruling coalition as he was targeted by some sections of the BJP

 Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said, "this country is tolerant and Muslims are tolerant too
" shahrukh ko mahaj isliye nishaanaa nahin banaaya janaa chahie kyonki vah ek muslim hai
 BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya had sparked a controversy on Tuesday when he tweeted that Shah Rukh may live in India but his 'soul' is in Pakistan

 raut ne kaha ki shahrukh khan superstar keval isiilie hai, kyonki bharat sahishnu he or un par dharm ke aadhaar par vichaar nahin kiya jaataa

 Also Shah Rukh spoke very late on this issue
 shivasena ke saansad sanjay raut ne kaha, yah desh sahishnu he tathaa muslim bhi sahishnu hai
 Shahrukh should not be targeted simply because he is a Muslim

 The Shiv Sena leader said, firstly, Shah Rukh Khan should not have got into the debate of tolerance and secondly that the number of Muslims among those who returned the award is almost negligible

 aam aadmi party ne saaf kiya he ki loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey aane ke baad party kisi bhi morche kaa samarthan nahin karegi
 The Aam Aadmi Party has issued a press release saying that the party has fought the Lok Sabha elections to give alternative politics to the country and it would be wrong to say that the party will support any front after the results
 aam aadmi party ke mutabik vah aise kisi bhi aise front kaa hissaa nahin ban sakati, jiske netaa bhrashtachar main shaamil hon
 Earlier, senior party leader Gopal Rai had told a news agency that the Aam Aadmi Party could support the Third Front to stop the BJP after the election results
 raay ne kaha tha ki vah gaiyr-congressi dharmanirpeksh gathjod ko muddon par aadhaarit samarthan de sakati he
 The round of voting for the Lok Sabha elections will end on Monday and in the meantime, Gopal Rai had said that if the initiative comes for the Third Front government after the election results come out on May 16, the party will offer him support on issues Can consider gopal raay ne kaha, agar aisi sthiti banati he, jisamen tisare morche kii sarkaar ko hamaare samarthan kii jarurat hoti he to haa, ham muddon par aadhaarit samarthan de sakate hai
 In the last few days, talks have intensified with the possibility of coming together with forces called secular to prevent the BJP from coming to power
 sapa adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav or anya kai netaaon ne is tarah kii sambhaavna jataai thi
 Rai, considered close to AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal, made it clear that the party's future role would be decided after analyzing the election result
 unhone kaha, hamaara andolan aam aadmi ke liye he or nishchit rup se mudda aadhaarit samarthan hoga
 The final decision on future action will be taken after May 16, when the election results will be announced
 aap ne 422 loksabhaa siton par apane ummidavaar utaare hai or kejariwal ne daawa kiya tha ki unki party kam se kam 100 siton par jeet darj karegi
 Rai, however, did not speculate on the number of AAP seats and said the struggle would continue even if the party's performance did not go as expected
 haal hi main dilli vidhansabha chunaavon main aam aadmi party ke jabardast pradarshan ke baad party ke aalaa netaaon ne loksabhaa chunaav main bhi ascharyajanak parinaam kii ummid jataai he
 The party hopes to do well in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi
 raay ne kaha, hamaara uddeshy yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki eemaandaar raajnneeti kii aawaaj sansad main pahunche
 Then it does not matter whether we get 10 seats or 30 seats
 unhone kaha, ham vahaan pahunchenge or vyavastha parivartan ke liye dabaav banaaenge
 Last week, CPI (M) leader Prakash Karat had said that a situation like 1996 was likely to happen and the Congress may be forced to support the government of secular parties to prevent the BJP from coming to the center
 unhone kaha tha ki gaiyr-congressi or gaiyr-bijepi dalon kaa morcha congress ke bahari samarthan se bahumat hasil kar saktaa he
 BSP leader Mayawati said on Saturday that her party would not join any front
 paryaapt sankhya main unke saansad aane se dharmanirpeksh takatein unki ore mukhaatib hongi
 a few days ago, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi had expressed confidence that the UPA-3 government would be formed, rejecting the possibility of supporting the Third Front government, but Mulayam had hoped that the Congress would support the Third Front government
 raay ne kaha ki kejariwal varanasi main narendra modi ke khilaaf maha-mukaable main jeet ke prati aashwast hai, kyonki banaras kii janata badlaav chaahati he
 He said, if Kejriwal wins, honest politics will proceed, while if Modi wins, then politics of hate, religion and corruption will continue

 bibisi main prakashit khabar ke mutabik, britain ke vaizanik kuch aise prayaas main lage hai, jisasepeshaab ko karant main tabdilakia ja saktaa he
 Scientists from the Bristol Robotics Lab of Britain are engaged in carrying out this project
 is project ke liye shuruyaat main vaigyanikon ne electro-active microorgenism se kai silinderon ko bharaa, ye microorgenism wo hai jo kharaab, gande pani or peshaab main panpate hai
 After this, electrons develop from these microorganisms
 inhi electron kaa upyog bijli utpaadan ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Reports suggest that 0–40 milliwatts of electricity can be produced from 2 liters of urine
 isi bijli kaa istemaal phir smartphone charge karne yaa lite jalaane main kiya ja saktaa he
 However, it is too early to say anything about how long this will be possible
 lekin ye sambhav hota to prakriya phir bhi lambii ho sakati he
 Until then it would be appropriate to wait
 jab 2017 main bhaajapa main shaamil hone ke liye swasthya mantri vishwajit rane ne congress chodi thi, to unhone kaha tha ki ve manohar parrikar kaa pita kii tarah sammaan karte hai
 But for the ailing Chief Minister, Rane has proved to be a problem
 beete saal november main unhone parrikar ke agnashay ke cancer kii charchaa karke bhaajapa ko mushkil main daalaa tha
 Now, he stirred up the claim that Parrikar had said that he could not be asked to step down as the files related to the purchase of Rafale planes were in his possession
 congress ne 3 janvari ko ek audio clip jari kiya jisamen rane kathith taur par ek sthaneey patrkaar se kareeb do maheene pehle hui rajya mantrimandal kii baithak kii charchaa kar rahe the
 In this Rane can be heard saying, "the Chief Minister said something very interesting
" '' unhone daawa kiya ki parrikar ne kaha tha ki rafel kii sari filein unke bedroom main hai
 Rane told the journalist, "you can make news on this
 
 
 mantrimandal main apane strot se cross-check kar lijie
 "rane can be heard saying," This means that he (BJP) is under pressure from him (parrikar)
 
 
 unhone kaha ki unke paas rafel kaa ek-ek dastavej he
 i don't know if they want someone to take this to Delhi
 ''congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne yah baat usee din loksabhaa main uthaai
 Parrikar said that there was no discussion on Rafael in that meeting while Rane claimed that audio clips had been tampered with to trap him
 us baithak main maujuud rahe nagar niyojan mantri vijay saradesai ne is par tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya
 But some BJP leaders believe that it is possible that Parrikar may have said something about Rafael in an informal conversation before the start of the meeting
 june main america se lautne ke baad yah unke mantrimandal kii pehali baithak thi
 Recalling this 'informal conversation', these leaders claimed that someone had asked Parrikar why they are not talking on Rafael when the government is in trouble
 unke mutabik, mukhyamantri ne jawaab diya, ''modiji is mudde ko thik se sambhaal rahe hai
 i do not need to interfere
 '' bhaajapa ke ek anya netaa ne naam na chhapane kii shart par kaha ki unhen rane ke bayaan par hairaani nahin he, ''parrikar bade-bade daawey karne ke aadi hai
 They may have said something to show their importance
 ''parrikar ne 3 janvari ko hi audio clip kii jaanch ke liye forensik pareekshan karaane kii baat kahi thi
 But no such order came that day
 apane pratidwandvi dilip sopte ko bhaajapa main shaamil kiye jane ke baad se naaraaz chal rahe purv mukhyamantri lakshmikant parsekar kaa kahana he ki yah clip chintaa kaa vishay he or isaki puri jaanch-padtaal honi chahie
 At the same time, Deputy Speaker Michael Lobo took a jibe at Rane, saying that the declining tourism and health services needed serious attention, while Congress state president, Girish Chodankar sarcastically demanded more security for Parrikar
 siyaasi paryvekshakon ke mutabik, is ghatana ke baad rane ke goa ke sheersh pad tak pahunchane kii koi sambhaavna nahin bachi he
 But given his influence in the four assembly constituencies — Valpoi, Moumé, Sankhali and Dicholim — the party will need him to retain the North Goa Lok Sabha seat
 vahiin, pareshaan rane ne 5 janvari ko dilli main bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah se milane kii koshish kii thi, par unki mulaakaat keval kendriya mahila or bal vikaas mantri menka gandhi ke saath ho saki thi
 The audio clip issue may also harm the BJP in the upcoming assembly by-elections in Shiroda and Mandrem
 goa ke mukhyamantri pad ke liye vishwajit rane kii koi bhi sambhaavna ab lagbhag khatm ho gai he
 He was in the running to substitute Manohar Parrikar

 ' The Congress had to attack the Modi government regarding the Vaishno Devi Yatra, and within a few hours the government had to present its explanation on it
 modi sarkaar kii kathani or kerani main antar ginate hue congress pravaktaa abhishek manu singhvi ne jammu or kashmir kaa hawala diya
 It is said that after the flood, Prime Minister Modi had assured the help of 44 thousand crores rupees
 lekin vastav main madad bahut kam pahunchi he
 In the same sequence, Singhvi mentioned that the BJP-PDP government of Kashmir on the journey of Vaishno Devi by helicopter 12
 5% kaa sarvice tex laga diya he
 Singhvi asked if this is the Jiziya tax that would have to be paid to those pilgrims going on a pilgrimage to Vaishno Devi who are weak and helpless and cannot reach it on foot
 tippaniyan It is known that the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb imposed jizya on the Hindus going on pilgrimage
 congress ne jazia shabd kaa istemaal kar ek tir se do nishane saadhe
 One, the BJP, which spoke of Hindu interest, was accused of working against Hindu interest
 doosraa khud par muslim tushtikaran main lage rahane kii chhavi todane kii taraf bhi ek kadam badhaayaa
 After this statement from the Congress, the government immediately came into action

 It is clear that the Central Government has started efforts towards getting it back
 dekhnaa he ki sarkaar main saathi pidipi is disha main kya rukh dikhaati he
 Counting the difference between the words and actions of the Modi government, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi cited Jammu and Kashmir
 kaha ki baadh ke baad pradhanmantri modi ne 44 hazaar karod rupee kii madad kaa bharosa diya tha
 But in fact the help is very little reached
 isi kram main singhvi ne zikr kiya ki helicopter se vaishno devi kii yatra karne par kashmir kii bijepi-pidipi sarkaar ne 12

 singhvi ne poocha ki kya ye jazia kar he jo vaishno devi kii tirthayatra par jane vaale un tirth yatriyon ko dena padegaa jo kamazor or laachaar hai or paidal chal kar vahaan tak pahunch nahin sakate
 The comments gyaat ho ki mughal badshaah aurangzeb ne tirth yatra par jane vaale hindooon par jazia lagaaya tha
 The Congress used the word jaziya to strike two targets with one stone

 The second also took a step towards breaking the image of persistence in Muslim appeasement

 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke pradhanmantri ummidavaar narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhane ke liye congress ne desh ke purv piem atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa sahaara liya he
 The Congress has put an article against Modi on its website, referring to the 'rajdharma' edict given by Vajpayee to Modi after the 2002 riots
 is lekh kaa sheershak he, 'no bady tu remind bijepi of its rajdharm'
 Vajpayee's picture has also been used in this article
 congress ne kaha he, 'shri modi ne rajdharm kaa paalan nahin kiya
 Can you give the future of the country in the hands of a person whom former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee did not consider worthy of the post of Chief Minister? 'this article said,' Any leader in BJP will stand tall
 Can not be done party ke is sansthaapak adhyaksh ne 6 saal tak desh kii bagdor sanbhali
 After the defeat at the hands of the Congress in 2004, Vajpayee himself admitted that riots occurred during Modi's tenure
 vah modi ke khilaaf karrwai karnaa chaahate the
 This was also confirmed by Jaswant Singh, a minister in the NDA government
 vaajapeyi ne to modi ke khilaaf karrwai na hone kii sthiti main istife kii dhamkee bhi de di thi
 'the article further writes,' The reason for Vajpayee's pain was that Modi did not follow Rajdharma
 unhone mukhyamantri ke taur par apane kartavya nahin nibhaae
 Vajpayee intended Modi to follow Rajdharma
 unase kaha tha ki ve logon ko jati, dharm or rang ke aadhaar par naa baante
 It is clear that the Chief Minister of Gujarat failed to stop the riots and at the same time discriminated against Gujaratis
 'is artical ke ant main likhaa gaya he, 'itnaa sabakuch jaanane ke baad yahi sawaal uthta he ki bijepi ke sabase bade netaa jab us shaks ko mukhyamantri ke pad se hataanaa chaahate the to vah party kaa piem ummidavaar kaise ho saktaa he?' a post shared by Chennai Super Kings (@chennaiipl) on Apr 18, 2018 at 10:12 pm PDTA post shared by Chennai Super Kings (@chennaiipl) on Apr 18, 2018 at 8:22 pm PDT central electronics limited (CEL) ne kai padon ke liye vaikency nikaali he

 Virat Kohli has scored a total of 2595 runs in all the three formats in the year 2016 and topped this matter
 unka top score 235 ran rahaa
 In the Test, 1215 runs were scored by Virat's bat last year, while in odis, Kohli was Team India's No
1 batsman
 viraat ne vanade main 739 ran thoke, jabaki tii-20 main 641 ran jade
 Talking about the route, he has been the top scorer of Tests in 2016 with 1477 runs
 root ne haal hi main bharat ke khilaaf hui test siries ke dauraan paanch maichon main 491 ran banaae the, jabaki kohli ne 655 ran banaae the
 Root played 15 odis and 61 in the year 2016
 23 ke ausat se 796 ran banaae the, jabaki viraat unase peeche rahe
 Meaning, Root is also a batting pillar of his team like Kohli
 test maichon main engladen ke jo root or johny bayersto ek hi team ke aise do ballebaaj rahe, jinhone ek calendar year main 1400 se adhik ran banaae
 Earlier in Test cricket history, this feat was done by Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, who were the legendary batsmen of Team India
 vahiin jo root kii baat karen, to vah 1477 ranon ke saath saal 2016 main test maichon ke top scorer rahe hai
 Root had scored 491 runs in five matches during the recent Test series against India, while Kohli had scored 655 runs
 root ne saal 2016 main 15 vanade khele or 61
 He scored 796 runs at an average of 23, while Virat followed him
 matlab root bhi kohli kii hi tarah apni team kii ballebaaji ke stambh hai
 In England, Joe Root and Johnny Bairstow were the only two batsmen from the same team to score more than 1400 runs in a calendar year
 test cricket itihaas main inase pehle team india ke diggaj ballebaaj rahe sachin tendulkar or virendra sahvaag ne yah karnama kiya tha

 aatank or sonanbbe ke dashak ke baad isamen sone kii taskari or aatanki network ke liye rakam bhejne ke tantra ke jud jane se maamla pechida ho gaya
 Hawala is a favorite medium of terrorist networks today because there is no electronic identity left in it and it is also difficult to trace the original source
 is tarah yah pakistan jaise aatank ko shah dene vaale deshon ke liye adarsh jariya he
 In addition to the international hawala connectivity mechanism, its domestic channels are also extensive, making internal transactions easier
 kareeb ek dashak pehle 2007 main kerala ke tatkaaleen khufia pramukh jaikab punnuse ne grih sachiv ko apni paanch panne kii gopneey report main nakli noton ke racket, hawala kaarobaar or kattarwadi islamic guton ke bich neshnal deveopment front (endief) jaisaa morcha banane ke prati aagaah kiya tha
 NDF is the parent organization of the Popular Front of India
 unhone hawala kaarobaariyon ke endief se kareebi rishton ko bataane vaali kai cese study kaa hawala diya tha
 There was no action on that report
 yahaan tak ki haal main 21 gumshuda yuvakon ke afghanistan main islamic state (ies) main shaamil hone ke maamle main bhi enie ko andeh he ki unki yatra kii rakam hawala ke jariye muhaiyaa karai gai
 Some police officials say that the jewelery business also takes help from hawala business and its smuggling of gold
 sone kii taskari se hawala kaarobaariyon ko apana munafa doguna karne main madad milti he
 According to Anavar, a hawala businessman in Koduvalli, "the hawala network has been charged Rs 1 crore for smuggling gold
" lagane se saat lakh ru
 Is earned
 ek karod ru
 You will get three times of each kilo in Dubai
 custom or airline kru kii madad se sona kerala yaa mumbai ke hawaii addon par utaara ja saktaa he
 "gold smuggling between Dubai and Kerala has increased in five years
 ye courier har vesh main aate hai
 On 23 January 2017, the Customs Department of Kochi apprehended a Catholic priest, Francis Isaac Kizhakaparambil, with a 300-gram gold bar
 yah uske bag main chocolate ke baar main lipta hua tha
 After demonetisation, the network started replacing old notes at a 30 per cent premium
 puraane noton main ek karod ru
 70 lakhs on hawala business on giving
 nae noton main de dete the
 This amount was exchanged through banks
 inamen 10 fisadi bank karmchaariyon ko diya jaataa tha or 20 fisadi hawala kaarobaari rakh letaa tha
 Anwar explains, "now the hawala transaction is no more profitable than the risk
 par iske saath sone kii taskari, mani londering, real estate or nakli note jaise dhandhon main acha phayda he
 "the links between hawala and gold smuggling in Koduvalli are openly visible
 sone ke liye pagal kerala main rashtriya rajmarg 766 par mahaj 400 meter kii duuri main 89 jevaraat kii khudara dukaanon kaa hona ajeebogareeb lagata he
 According to intelligence reports, many hawala traders also work with gold smuggling networks and are spending money in real estate as well
 arbia jewalers ke maalik abdul naseer garv se kehete hai, ''yahaan rajya main sabase adhik sankhya main jevaraat kii dukaane hai
 “around 1,400 families are employed in these shops
 haalanki naseer jevaraat or hawala kaarobaar main kisi tarah ke sambandh ke baat ko nakaarte hai or kehete hai ki yahaan gaanv ke gaanv sonaaron ke hai
 About 140 grams of gold used to be sold everyday in Koduvalli but after demonetisation the sale fell to zero (because most of the transactions are in cash), but now normal business is returning
 lekin hawala ko uski syah duniya ke baavjood safedposh aparaadh mana jaataa he, jo rajya main kanoon-vyavastha kii kisi tarah kii samasya paidaa nahin karata he
 He is helped by weak laws and corrupt officials
 ek varisht police adhikari kehete hai, ''hawala kaarobaariyon ko pakadaaey main hamaari simit bhoomika hi he
 Whenever a huge amount is seized, we refer the matter to the Enforcement Directorate
 femaa kanoon main khaamiyon ke chalate zyaadaatar hawala kaarobaari kuch jurmaana bhar kar chhot jate hai
 "normally hawala traders submit a statement that reveals the source of income or miss some of the fine
 is tarah kerala kii ''paise kii surang" kaa kaala dhandha badastoor chalata rahata he

 The retail price of onion is also being quoted up to Rs 40 per kg
 madar deyari kii safal dukaanon par tamaato 55 rupee kilo tathaa pyaaj 29 rupee kilo bik rahaa he
 At the same time, tomatoes selling retail vegetables are selling for Rs 60 to 70 kg and onions at Rs 40 a kg
 upabhokta maamalon ke vibhaag ke aankadon ke anusaar tamaato sabase mahangaa bhopal main he jahaan yah 85 rupee kilo tak pahunch gaya he
 After that, Kanpur and Port Blair were located where 80 rupees kg was sold
 vyapaariyon ke anusaar ajadpur mandi main tamaato kaa thok bhav 45 se 50 rupee kilo, vahiin pyaaj kaa mulya thodaa kam hokar 20 se 25 rupee kilo he

 ' Darshan Lal Arora, president of the tomato trader Sandh in Azadpur mandi, said that prices have risen due to fall in supply from northern parts

 loksabhaa chunaav ke parinaam (loksabha Election Results 2019) aane or bijepi (BJP) ko isamen apaar safalataa milane ke baad nae siyaasi sameekaran bananaa shuru ho gaye hai
 Will there be a change of power in Karnataka in the current situation? Will JDS leader and Chief Minister Kumaraswamy leave Congress and form government with BJP? An attempt to find an answer to this question is also going on in the political corridor of Karnataka
 kya karnataka (karnataka) kii siyaasi tasviir badalegi? jedies (JDS) congress kaa talmail jari rahegaa yaa phir tuutegaa? yah sawaal isliye uth rahe hai kyonki jedies supremeo devegoda or unke pote nikhil kumaraswami (kumaraswamy) kii haar kii vajah devegoda parivaar congress netaa siddharmaiya ko maanata he
 In an informal meeting of the Kumaraswamy cabinet, both the Congress and the JDS tried to show that everything was fine and that there was no change in the government of Karnataka right now
 up mukhyamantri ji parameshwar (G Parmeshwara) ne kaha ki chunaav ke jo parinaam aae hai ve loksabhaa ke hai, vidhansabha ke nahin
 So nothing is going to change
 jedies ke pravaktaa em arivalagn ne kaha ki kumaraswami (kumaraswamy) ne rahul gandhi (rahul Gandhi) ko patr likhakar kaha ki aap sarkaar banaaen, ham usko samarthan denge
 But Rahul Gandhi said that you will remain the Chief Minister for the next four years
 darasal bijepi kii karnataka main apni simaaen hai
 The bjp's central leadership is not in a position to displease the Lingayat leader Yeddyurappa
 karnataka main bijepi ke paas ab vidhansabha main 105 vidhayak hai or do nirdaleey uske saath hai
 Yeddyurappa is not averse to joining hands with the JDS
 shart yah he ki mukhyamantri ve banenge
 Kumaraswamy becomes deputy chief minister, but Yeddyurappa does not mind
 jedies ne apane 37 vidhayak or sahyogi bispi ke ek emele ke saath 38 siton vaali party ke aupne kunbe ko jodtod se bachaae rakhaa he
 Half a dozen mlas of Congress may be ready to change the pan, but it is impossible for BJP to reach the magic figure of government formation
 kam se kam 13 vidhayak agar bijepi todatii he to sadan main sankhya 212 ho jaaegi
 That is, BJP can prove majority with 107 members
 lekin yah aasaan nahin he
 It is also not easy for the BJP to convince Yeddyurappa to give up the post of Chief Minister
 yani bijepi ko lagata he ki yaa to sarkaar gire yaa kisi tarah giraakar yahaan raashtrapati shashan acha vikalp ho saktaa he
 The lack of coordination in the JDS Congress alliance is constantly increasing
 bijepi kaa kendriya netritv chahta he ki aisi surat main vah philhal wet and vaach kii niti apanaae taaki sarkaar khud hi gir jaae or pashchim bengal vidhansabha ke saath saal ke aakhir main yahaan bhi madhyavadhi chunaav karaae ja saken

 chappan varshiya jafar ikbaal or unke aadhe se bhi kam umr ke 26 varshiya sandip singh khel ke do aise alag-alag daur se taalluk rakhte hai jisamen infrastracchar or anya suvidhaon main baari sudhaar hua he, lekin nateezon main naatakeey giravat ai he
 Iqbal has been part of the Indian hockey team that won the gold medal at the 1980 Moscow Olympics, while Sandeep Singh suffered a notoriety of being at the bottom of the London Olympics in 2012
 associat editor ji
 s
 vivek se baatcheet main hockey ke in donon sitaron ne rashtriya khel kii haalat, uske ateet or vartmaan par roshni daali
 There is a steady decline in Indian hockey
 aakhir kyon?jafar ikbaal:kaaphi pehle ham mahashakti the
 We are now working hard for reform, but other countries are improving much faster than us
 ab unke paas aise bahut se umdaa khilaadi hai, jaisaa ki pehle hamaare paas rah chuke hai
 We have many good players who are fighting in one place
 khud sandip kaa hi udhaaharan len
 He is a world class drag flicker, but unfortunately you cannot find another person to replace him in this country
 hamaare paas 4-5 vishwa stareey khilaadi hai, baaki sirf ausat khilaadi hai
 If you want to win the Olympics, then there should be 11-12 world class players who have a sharp mind, a lot of stamina and speed
 sandip singh:kai achche khilaadi aa rahe hai, lekin hamaare paas ek back-ap system hona chahie
 By the time we prepare a potential back-up player, he is out of the team
 yah hamaari team kii badi samasya he
 The training and workload of team members should be closely monitored
 landan olympic se pehle kai achche pradarshan ko dekhte hue logon main medal kii ummid bandha gai thi
 But by staying in last place, the team discounted its popularity
 sandip:khiladinnon ne acha karne ke liye kadi mehnat kii thi
 Even during the preparation for the Olympics, our training was going very well and we played many matches
 durbhaagya se khel ke pehle hamane isaki ati kar lee or yah hamaare khilaaf gaya
 As a player we tried to do our best, but the assessment of our preparation proved to be wrong and we were tired
 jafar:mujhe yaad he ki bharat ne 1968 ke olympic main bronj medal jeeta tha
 In those days it was very difficult to digest the bronze medal
 ab to kisi bhi medal ko ek bonus ke taur par hi dekha jaataa he
 In those days, after winning the bronze medal, we had to walk around hiding our face
 ham kabhi bhi apane haath main hockey stick lekar nahin chalate the kyonki isse log yah jaan jate ki ham hockey khilaadi hai or koi hamaare saath duvryavhaar kar saktaa tha
 People did not pay any medal in hockey other than gold
 puraane jamaane main pradhanmantri bhi club match dekhne jaaya karte the
 Now there is hardly any audience in hockey matches
 yuva bhi hockey se nahin jud paa rahe
 Why after all? Zafar: This game is losing its popularity because the youth are giving preference to such games which have more money
 hockey india ek lig (echiel) kii shuruyaat karne ja rahaa he taaki hockey ke khilaadi bhi kuch dhan kama saken
 Such things are very important
 ranjai trophy khilne vaale cricketer bhi desh kii taraf se hockey khilne vaale khiladinnon se zyada paisa paa rahe hai
 Sandeep, this question is with you
 echiel ko bada badlaav laane vaala mana ja rahaa he
 To what extent do you think such a professional league can raise money and keep the audience interested? Sandeep: People mostly go to watch matches between different countries
 unke liye duniyabar ke achche khiladinnon kaa ek saath jutakar khelte dekhnaa ek alag anubhav hoga
 Our players will be able to learn a lot from international stars and showcase their talent
 bharat main prashansakon kii pratikriya aam taur par ati ke kareeb ho jaati he
 Sandeep: When you lose, they come to you and expect you to give a reason for the defeat
 kabhi-kabhi ve naaraaz bhi ho jate hai, lekin zyaadaatar unka ravaiya or aapako dekhne kaa unka tarika hi badla hota he
 After the Olympics, he said that he had a team that lost all the matches
 lekin jab aap jitate hai, jaisaa ki hamane kaamanwealth khelon main dekha tha, log pagal ho jate hai
 Hockey has been fortunate to have the support of a large section
 vastav main 2010 ke kaamanwealth khelon or yahaan tak ki landan 2012 main bhi stadium bharaa dekh hamen kaaphi aashcharya hua tha
 i hope that we will get good results and also our staunch supporters who celebrate it
 jafar:mujhe lagata he ki pehle ke mukaable ab darshakon kii soch main baari badlaav aayaa he
 i am also surprised to see that many spectators now come to support the team
 yah hamaare daur ke mukaable bada badlaav he
 People used to get very angry then
 jab ham haarate the to hamen janata kii khub gaali sunani padati thi
 Players often cry out of lack of facilities
 sattar ke dashak main yah bahut saamaanya baat hua karti thi
 Zafar: During the 1982 Asian Games, we were held in the same National Stadium where we used to play and we had to sleep on the floor
 koi charpai yaa cooler nahin miltaa tha or asi kaa to naam hi nahin suna gaya tha
 Even during the World Cup, we used to stay in the dormitory of the stadium and frankly, we did not feel any problem with this
 hamaare aasapaas ke log hi naaraaz hote the or yah baat uthaate the ki ham jis tarah kii suvidhaon ke hakdaar hai, ve nahin di ja raheen
 We never had any video
 ham virdohi tiimon kaa khel dekhne ke liye stadium jate or unke khel kaa adhyayan karte
 In those days, training was often tiring
 hamen ek footbal maidan ke 40 chakkar lagane ko kaha jaataa
 We would have to run on sand
 hamaare paas koi psychologist yaa physiotherapist nahin tha
 Our team's coach Balakishan used to handle all these responsibilities alone
 sandip:saubhaahgya se ab kaaphi chijen behatar ho gai hai (muskaraate hai)
 We are accommodated in good places
 hamaare paas ek specialist trainer, ek specialist dietishayan or ek video analist he
 Yes, we also do not have a psychologist
 hamen vastav main ab isaki jarurat he taaki ham maansik rup se majboot ho saken
 Zafar, one of the finest forward players born in the country, you can fit into any team of any generation, but can Sandeep also get a place in an all-time team? Zafar: When we played European teams, we often got 7- There would have been 8 penalty corners, but we could hardly convert anyone into a goal
 tab 70 minute ke khel main kareeb 50 minute ham virdohi team ke half main hi rahete, lekin short corner kaa phayda nahin uthaa pate
 Conversely they sometimes go ahead and take advantage of their short corner opportunity
 to haa, yadi sandip hamaare saath hota to ham kaaphi behatar kar pate
 Sandeep: Thank you, Zafar bhai

 Kohli will be expected to perform well, along with him other batsmen will also have to perform well
 khaskar agar salaami ballebaaj agar bharat ko acchhee shuruyaat dene main kaamyaab rahe to siries behad dilachasp rahegi
 Will the performance of Hugh's death be seen on Clarke's performance? It is no secret that Michael Clarke is currently Australia's most trusted cricketer
 bharat ke khilaaf inkaa record bhi shandaar rahaa he
 But after the death of Phil Hughes, the gum in which Clarke was seen will not have any effect in his game
 yah sawaal har cricket premi ke man main he
 If we talk about Adelaide, Clarke's bat has played well on this ground
 clark ne yahaan 9 test maichon main 98
 Has scored 1279 runs from a superb average of 38
 jisamen 6 shatak bhi shaamil hai
 Once again, the biggest challenge for the Indian team will be to overcome Clarke
 saath hi david warner, steven smith or shen watasan par bhi lagaam lagaana behad jaruri hoga
 Australian Pace Battery's biggest threat was the death of Billy, of course, Hugh, but before the first Test, Mitchell Johnson has made it clear that his bowlers will not show any hesitation in hitting the bouncer
 is bayaan ke aate hi siries main thodi garmi bad gai he
 The Australian team has the likes of Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Ryan Harris, who are the biggest challenge for Team India
 in gendbaajon ko safaltaapurvak khilne ke alaava ek or chunauti team india ke saamne he
 It is often the case that when runs are not scored against the fast bowlers, the batsmen are caught in the spinner's trick in order to speed up the run speed, so the challenge to avoid this is also in front of the team
 australia main asana nahin rahi he team india kii rahbhartiya team ne jab-jab australia kaa daura kiya he unki raah aasaan nahin rahi he
 This is the fifth time Team India is in Australia to play the border-gavaskar Trophy
 isse pehle chaar dauron main siries jeet kaa sapana to sapana hi rahaa he, bharat ne australian dharti par sirf 2 match jite hai
 Hughes to be paid tribute Australia will pay tribute to the late batsman Philip Hughes in the first Test between India and Australia starting on December 9
 australian khilaadi match ke liye apni shart par huge kaa test cap number 408 pahanenge
 Players and team management will also tie a black band on the arm
 khel shuru hone se pehle australian or bhartiya timen adelaide ovel ke bich main likhe gaye 408 par khadi hongi
 Pitch and Condition: Adelaide has a history that spinners have played a very important role here
 shuruyaat main thodi madad tej gendbaajon ke liye rahegi lekin iske baad pich ballebaaji ke liye kaaphi anukool ho jaaegi
 But as the game progresses the spinner will start getting help
 jahaan tak mausam kaa sawaal he to sabhi paanch dinon ke liye saaf mausam kii bhavishyavaanee kii gai he

 On August 15, there are many restrictions before entering the Red Fort, many have to undergo security checks
 andar kya lekar janaa he kya lekar nahin janaa he yah police akhabaaron main vigyaapan ke jariye bataati he or is tarah ke disha-nirdesh nimantran card main bhi hote hai
 Rohan of East Delhi had also read and watched all this
 unka kahana he ki vah apane dost ke saath subah-subah laal kile par aa gaya kyonki use swatantraaa diwas kaa kaarykram dekhnaa tha, lekin jaise hi lalakile ke baahar lagi suraksha jaanch se guzara use roak liya gaya kyonki usne kaali shart pahani hui thi
 According to Rohan, wearing black shirt is prohibited, neither has heard of it nor know it
 use kaha gaya kaali topi or kaali shart pahanakar andar ja nahin ja sakate
 According to Rohan, he had decided that he had to watch the program even if he had to take off his shirt
 rohan ke mutabik, surakshakarmiyon se nokajhonk kii baaten kuch mahilaayein or ladkiyaan bhi sun rahi thim
 Meanwhile, a girl gave her scarf to Rohan and then was able to cover Rohan's scarf and enter the Red Fort
 tippaniyan Many people had this problem like Rohan
 pichhali baar bhi main jab 15 agast ke maukey par laal kile par tha to kai log maayoos ho gaye the, kyonki vah kaale kapade pahanakar aae the or surakshakarmiyon ne unhen andar nahin jane diya tha
 i talked to several security personnel about this

 Many policemen laugh and say that brother should not wear black clothes in good work anyway
 purvi dilli ke rohan ne bhi yah sab padhaa or dekha tha
 He says he came to the Red Fort with his friend early in the morning as he was to watch the Independence Day program, but was stopped as soon as he passed through the security check outside the Red Fort as he was wearing a black shirt
 rohan ke mutabik, kaali shart pahanakar aane par pabandi he, aisa to na kahin suna he or na pataa he
 He was told not to go inside wearing a black hat and black shirt
 rohan ke mutabik, usne tay kar liya tha ki use kaarykram to dekhnaa he chaahe shart utarkar janaa pade
 According to Rohan, some women and girls were also hearing noises from security personnel
 isi bich ek ladki ne apana dupatta rohan ko de diya or phir rohan dupattey ko odhakar laal kile main daakhil ho paaya
 The comments rohan kii tarah yah pareshaani kai logon ko hui
 Last time also when i was at the Red Fort on the occasion of August 15, many people were disheartened, because they came wearing black clothes and the security personnel did not let them in
 maine is bare main kai surakshakarmiyon se baat kii
 No one speaks openly about the secret of black clothes, but most of the security personnel said that no one would enter and protest against the Prime Minister by waving his black shirt or hat in the air, so wearing black clothes or carrying black flag is prohibited
 kai pulicekarmi hansate hue kehete hai bhai sahab shubh kaam main to vaise bhi kaale kapade nahin pahanane chahie

 unhone bataaya ki aazaadee ke baad pehali baar bharat aurapakistandonon ek hi sainya abhyaas kaa hissaa honge
 However, the armies of the two countries have worked together in the United Nations (UN) peacekeeping mission
 rus, china, kirgiz ganraajya, kazakhstan, tajikistan or uzbekistan ke raashtrapatiyon ne saal 2001 main shanghai main ek shikhar sammelan main SCO kii sthapana kii thi
 In 2005, India and Pakistan were included as observers of this group
 pichley saal donon deshon ko is suraksha samooh kaa purna sadsy banaaya gaya
 China strongly favored Russia and Pakistan to make India a member
 yah sainya abhyaas us samay saamne aayaa he, jab bharat or pakistan ke bich tanaav kaa maahaul he
 Pakistan has been continuously violating ceasefire from across the border and is carrying out terrorist infiltration attempts
 vahiin, bharat kii ore se bhi pakistan ko munhtod jawaab diya ja rahaa he
 Recently, Pakistan had also targeted border Indian villages, in which many people lost their lives and many were injured
 bharat or pakistan ke bich niyantran rekha par aaj phir tanaav he
 On Monday, Pakistan's border action team fired mortar at Mendhar and brutalized the bodies of two Indian soldiers who were martyred
 pakistan kii border ection team ne bhartiya seemaa main 250 meter ghuskar javaanon ke shav ko chat-vikshat kiya
 After this, the Indian Army was given a free hand from the government and the Indian Army retaliated and demolished two Pakistan border posts and killed 7 Pakistani soldiers
 isse pehle kulgaam main aatanki hamalaa hua, isi hafte kupwada main sena ke base par aatanki hamalaa hua

 pakistan se badla lene kii bharat main tej hoti maang ke bich yahaan sawaal uthne laga he ki aakhir pakistan chahta kya he? aakhir pakistan bharat ko abhi hi kyon uksaa rahaa he?1
 Nawaz Government's difficulty in India's relations with Pakistan has been that whenever the government there is not able to face internal difficulties, it takes time to increase the tension on the border with India
 abhi navaj sarkaar panama paper li maamle main musiibat main he
 Opposition parties are pressing for resignation, with the government on the backfoot in court
 aise main andruni sankat se dhyaan hataakar bharat ke border par bad rahe tanaav ko mohara banane kii koshish isamen saaf dikh rahi he

 In Pakistan-occupied Kashmir too, there have been strong voices against Pakistan
 baluchistan main aazaadee kii maang dabaane ke liye pakistan daman par hi utar aayaa he
 India has also announced open support to the demand for independence in Balochistan, in which Pakistan wants to confuse India by increasing tension on the Kashmir border
 4
 China's instigation to get out of the US camp and forging alliances with China, could also be one of the reasons for China's growing rivalry with India
 china pakistan se hokar 46 billian dollar kii badi laagat se aarthik galiyara bana rahaa he
 Against which India has raised its voice
 pakistan ke kai hisson main sthaneey log bhi china kii is pariyojna ko samrajyavaadee kadam bataa rahe hai
 China has been blocking India's efforts to get banned against Pakistani terrorists in the UN
 ye ho saktaa he ki arunachal or ladakh main china ko bharat kii ore se mil rahe munhtod jawaab or seemaa masale ko lekar badi talkhi ke bich china kii shah par pakistan bharat ke saath talkhi badhaakar kashmir main hi uljhaana chahta he

 is saal upi board ne 12veen ke students ko raahat dene vaala faisal kiya he
 Under this, now the 12th board students of UP board will be able to take compartment examination
 upi board (UP Board) main ab hiskool kii hi tarah 12veen yani intermediat (UP Board 10th, 12th) ke students ko bhi kampartment pariksha dene kaa mauka mil sakegaa

 He said that this proposal to provide compartment examination facility will be stamped soon
 pariksha ke naam par students ko ghabrahat na ho, isi kaaran moolyankan padghati main badlaav kiya ja rahaa he

 Intermediate does not have this option
 agali kaksha main jane ke liye parikshaarthi kaa sabhi vishyon main paas hona jaruri hota he

 a similar incident has been observed this time in Phulwari Sharif, adjacent to Patna, the capital of Bihar
 rambalak naam kaa ek adivasee apni beti kaa ilaaj karaane ke liye jamui se mangalvaar ko patna ke ames pahunchaa
 Rambalak, who is a laborer in Jamui and is very poor, came to AIIMS with his wife Sanju to treat his daughter Roshan, but after reaching such a big hospital in Bihar, what happened to Rambalak caused his daughter to die
 Has gone
 aaie aapako bataate hai ki aakhir rambalak ke saath ames main kya hua or kis tareeke se maanavtaa ek baar phir sharmasaar hui
 After reaching AIIMS with her ailing daughter, the guard standing there asked her to register her daughter
 itane bade aspataal main pahunchane ke baad rambalak ko samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha ki aakhir use panjikaran kahaan karwaanaa he or kaise karwaanaa he
 Because of this, he wandered from one counter to another
 rambalak aspataal main dhakke khate rahaa or apni biimaar beti kaa hawala detaa rahaa magar uske baavjood bhi koi doctor yaaspataal kaa karmchaariuski madad karne ke liye saamne nahin aayaa
 Finally, when Rambalak understood which counter he had to stand at to register, he went there and got in line, but by the time his number came, he was told that the OPD time was over and he would come the next day
 Returns
 isi dauraan rambalak kii beti kii haalat or bighad gai or aspataal ke andar hi uski maut ho gai
 But even then Rambalak's troubles have not reduced
 garibi kii vajah se apni beti kii laash ko ambulance se ghar le jane ke paise bhi uske paas nahin the or aspataal ne bhi uski koi madad nahin kii
 Eventually, Rambalak picked up his daughter's body on his shoulder and along with his wife walked for 2 km to Phulwarisharif Tempo Stand and from there he somehow reached the Patna railway station
 uske baad train pakad kar apni beti kii laash ke saath waapas jamui chalaa gaya
 This incident has once again embarrassed humanity and has told how human society is becoming insensitive

 People were bored with these processes
 " He further said that some people used to come with the notification that they could change up to Rs 4,000 but when the bankers told them that now the limit had come down to Rs 2,000, they were not sure
 isse donon ke bich main bahes ho jaati thi
 This was a psychological weight

 The wedding discussions of both the actors are also in full swing
 isse alag donon kalakaar apni shaadi ko lekar media ke saamne bachate najar aate hai
 Ranveer spoke openly on rumors related to marriage in a recent interview
 ranvir ne idia today ko die gaye ek intervyuu main pehali baar deepika se apane rishte kii baat kubuli
 Ranveer publicly stated that he and Deepika are couples
 shaadi kii baat par bhi unhone bolaa ki ye bhi unke plan main shumaar hai
 However, Ranveer tried to avoid saying anything completely and gave the right time
 deepika-ranbir kii tabiyat hui kharaab, fishan sho kiya cancil!ranvir ne kaha ki afvaah mahaj ek afvaah hi hoti he or kisi cheez ko ofishili kehane kaa matlab use ofishili kahana hota he
 Regarding the dates, he said that he is not sure about when this will happen in the future
 isse aage ranvir ne kaha ki philhal donon log kaam main bahut vyast hai
 Apart from this, he said about Deepika that she is upset with her back problem right now and is slowly trying to overcome it
 ranvir-deepika kii shaadi 'tay', is maheene le sakate hai pherebta den ki donon kalakaaron ke bich pyaar saal 2013 main film 'goliyon kii raasalila- ramlila' ke dauraan panpa tha

 mamata banerjee ne shanivaar coloksabhaa chunaav 2019 se pehle sabhi vipakshi partiyon ko modi sarkaar ke khilaaf ek manch par bulaayaa
 BJP party leader and MP Shatrughan Sinha also appeared on this platform
 manch se bijepi netaa shatrughna sinha ne apni hi sarkaar se sawaal daage or piem modi sepucha ki aap jab tak sawaalon se bhaagate rahenge tab tak ham sabko maananaa padegaa ki vaaki 'chaukeedaar chor' he
 Shatrughan Sinha said at Mamta's rally that the country wants change
 mujhase log kehete hai ki main bijepi ke khilaaf bolta hum, lekin agar sach kahana baghawat he to samajho main bhi baagi hum
 i may not be in BJP after this rally
 bijepi ke netaa shatrughna sinha ne kaha ki is kshan tak main abhi bhaajapa main hum
 Right now Yashwant Sinha was saying that after this rally i will definitely be removed from the party
 agar main bijepi main hum bhi to main pehle bharat ke janata kaa hum
 My accountability and responsibility are with the people of India
 main jo bhi karata hum or kahata hum vah deshhit or janhit main he
 He said that nothing is greater than the interest of the country
 main party ko aainaa dikhaata hum
 i tell you this is democracy, do not commit too much
 shatrughna sinha ne kaha kiatal bihari vaajapeyi ji ke vakt or modi ji ke vakt main kya antar pate hai
 i say that in Atal ji's time, there was democracy, in this time there is dictatorship
 yah nahin chalegaa
 It is more with the people of the country
 achaanak ratorat tughluqi farmaan jari kar di
 You have declared demonetisation
 kyon aapane notebandi kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Have you ever thought about how this will affect the street vendors, the farmers, the laborers, the youth
 bagaiyr kisi se salaah liye aapane yah kiya
 i certainly believe that it was not the party's decision
 agar party kaa yah faisla hota to adwani ji, joshi ji, yashavanth sinha, shouri ji or mujhe bhi pataa hota
 But this decision was taken directly from the PMO
 notebandi vaale faisle ko lekar modi sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue shatrughna sinha ne kaha kiapane hi paise nikaalane ke liye logon ko sharmindagi kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Business was ruined
 ghar kii mahilaayein, maatayen-bahanen jo ghar ke logon ke liye acchhee niyat se paise dabaa kar rakhi thi,ve sab achaanak hawa-hawaii ho gaye
 After all, who gave the right to demonetisation
 abhi notebandi se ubar hi nahin paae the ki jiesti kaa farmaan jari kar diya
 The Congress president who is capable, who won the Congress in three states in one year, named the GST the Gabbar Singh Tax
 abhi tak jiesti main 368 sanshodhan kiya gaya
 When Modi himself was the Chief Minister, he had fierce opposition
 jiesti ko lekar aisi ghoshnaa kii ki jaise duusari aazaadee mili ho
 He said that worshipers started getting destroyed by this
 gurudware main lungar par jiesti lag gaye
 That is, demonetisation on one side, GST i
e
 it is called bitter gourd on neem
 aaj tak kisaan jis tarah tadap rahe hai, us par sabhi log bol chuke hai
 The biggest and worst thing is Rafael
 main yah bhi nahin kah rahaa hum ki aap doshi hai, magar yah bhi nahin kahuunga ki aap doshi nahin hai
 If you will not say anything and hide, then the people of the country will say that the 'watchman is the thief' of the country
 unhone kaha ki bihar main ise thathrai karnaa kehete hai
 If you will keep listening to this till Modi ji on Rafale, till then you will keep hearing that the watchman is a thief
 unhone kaha ki echeel ne sukhoi jaise hawaii jahaaj banaae
 HAL, which is a company in India, was not given this contract, but why did you give it to a company who came to the company ten days ago and did not even make a bicycle
 modi ji rafel par jawaab dijie, nahin to jab tak 'thethrai' karenge, aap sunate jaaenge desh kaa 'chaukeedaar chor' he

 iske alaava kai cancer shodh sansthaanon main bhi madhumakhi ke in utpaadon ko upyog main laayaa ja rahaa he

 According to the ministers, the Modi government has played with its credibility by ordering the Delhi Police to implicate the Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister in a completely fake case
 police ke paas dilli ke logon kii suraksha kii ahm jimmedaari he
 The charge sheet containing unfounded allegations filed by the Delhi Police will fly when it is placed for judicial investigation

 Nirav Modi, a diamond businessman who had fled the country after cheating Punjab National Bank, had filed a petition for bail in the British High Court
 jis par landan hycourt main sunwaayee hui
 During the hearing, Modi's lawyer Claire Montgomery argued that Nirav Modi is a diamond merchant
 is maamle main bharat sarkaar kaa paksh crown prosicution sarvice (sipies) rakh rahi he
 CPS has said that Nirav Modi may be absconding
 vahiin is maamle main aaj koi faisla nahin aayaa or buudhvaar ko phir se sunwaayee hogi
 During Tuesday's hearing Nirav Modi's counsel argued that the rate of migration in white-collar crime is low
 is par maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe jaj ne kaha ki ho saktaa he ki unki ichha aisi na ho, lekin aisa sambhav he
 Nirav's lawyer said his assets have been frozen in Switzerland and other places

 Claire stated that as of 6 January 2018 there was no problem with lending

 He said that the consortium collapsed due to pnb's collusion and the group went into the administrative system

 Nirav Modi's lawyer feared all letters of understanding were unsafe after Gokulnath Shetty retired from the Brady House branch
 unhone daawa kiya ki modi ne kisi ko bhi jaan se maarane kii koi dhamkee nahin di
 The lawyer's plea is significant because CPS has previously claimed on behalf of Indian agencies to have threatened to kill Mr
 Lad in the past when Modi spoke against him
 laad uske baad kahiraa main tha
 Modi's lawyer told the court that the picture that emerges now is that these people cooperate to make sure that they return to India and meet the ED
 unhone kaha ki gavaah kaa hastkshep ke koi sakshya nahin he or daleel di ki subhash parab ne spasht kar diya he ki vah apni marji se kahiraa main rahe
 Significantly, Nirav Modi is accused in the case of fraud and money laundering of up to two billion dollars with PNB
 31 janvari 2018 ko is maamle main mukadmaa darj hone ke baad sibiai ne neerav kii talash shuru kii thi, lekin kaaphi dinon baad pataa chalaa ki vah landan main he

 bataa den ki landan kii vibhinn adaalaton main teen dafe neerav kii jamaanat yachika khaarij ho chuki he
 Nirav's lawyers had offered to increase the bail amount to £ 2 million as well as detention, which was rejected by the court

 For the past few years, it is seen that by the month of December, the level of pollution in the air of the capital Delhi becomes so dangerous that it becomes difficult for people to breathe
 is samasya kaa sthai samaadhaan dhundne kii disha main kendriya paryaavaran mantri dow harshavardhan ne mangalvaar ko dilli or iske chaar padosi rajyon ke saath baithak bulaai
 These states include Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh

 The meeting was represented by cabinet ministers from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, high officials from Punjab and Rajasthan
 uttar bharat main barish or tej hawa ke chalate pichley kuch dinon se smog or pradooshan ke str main kami ai he
 This is the first time to meet the year-round challenge of pollution when the central government as well as the representatives of the pollution affected states of North India sat together to discuss
 yahaan ye bataanaa jaruri he kipradooshanke gambhir mudde par hone vaali is baithak ke liye dilli, punjab, haryana, rajasthan or uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantriyon ko bulaayaa gaya tha
 But out of the Chief Ministers of the five states, only Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal attended it
 punjab or rajasthan ne to baithak main mukhyamantri to dur mantri tak ko bhejnaa bhi jaruri nahin samajha, bas adhikari bhej kar hi apana daayitv puraa kar diya
 Industries Minister Vipul Goel attended the meeting on behalf of Haryana
 goyal ne ‘aaj tak’ ko bataaya ki baithak main hissaa lene vaale sabhi rajyon ne pradooshan se ladane ke liye ek ruparekha taiyaar kii
 Apart from this, five states have also mentioned the steps taken by them
 rajyon ne is silsile main unhen pesh aa rahi dikkaton kaa hawala bhi diya
 At present, no task force has been constituted by the five states and the central government to fight pollution 
 haalanki sutron kaa kahana he ki aane vaale samay main pradooshan ke khilaaf ladane ke liye aisi hi or baithak bulaai jaaengi
 Also, a roadmap will be prepared to eliminate pollution from North India

 The demand for boycott of this match was also raised after the attack in Pulwama

 All tickets are sold out

 Both teams have started the journey in the World Cup
 khel patrkaar shivendra kumaar singh ne donon kii sambhaavnaaon par asian breadman kahe jane vaale pakistan ke purv diggaj jahir abbaas se baatcheet kii
 Excerpts from that: Are you also thrilled about the match between India and Pakistan in the World Cup? Yes, of course, this match has the most demand
 log hajaaron pound main tikat lene ko taiyaar hai
 Once upon a time, cricket fans used to watch the Ashes series, but now its craze has also reduced
 jabaki bharat-pakistan kaa match ab bhi 'croud pular' he, jisase aayojakon ko bhi acchhee khaasi kamai hoti he
 You 'follow' both teams closely
 kaise mukaable kii ummid kar rahe hai?dekhie, is baat se koi inkaar nahin kar saktaa ki bharat is vakt ek behtareen team he
 His fielding and bowling are also very good
 batting to khayr bahut acchhee he hi
 So these three are with Advantage Team India
 pakistan kii team ke liye bhi main kah saktaa hum ki koi soch tak nahin saktaa tha, yah team chapiens trophy jeet jaaegi
 But he did that feat
 is vishwacap main bhi england ke khilaaf unhone dhamaakedaar jeet darj kii
 England are not only strong contenders for the World Cup but also the number one team in the world
 asal main baat yah he ki match ke din jo acha khel jaae, nateeja usee kaa hota he
 Once upon a time, Pakistan's team often defeated the Indian team
 pakistan kii team bahut acchhee hua karti thi
 Now the days have come that India's team has become very spectacular
 usne apane pradarshan main 'remarceble' sudhaar kiya he
 So this round keeps on going
 bharat ke khilaaf pakistan ke kin khiladinnon se aapako zyada ummid he? khaastaur par aapane england ke khilaaf match kaa zikr kiya
 Pakistan's batting was excellent in that match
 overol kya aapako lagata he ki pakistan kii team main bharat ko haraa dene kaa madda he?jaisaa maine pehle kaha, kisi ko ummid nahin thi ki pakistan kii team champions trophy jeet jaaegi
 But it happened
 aap kuch nahin kah sakate
 Babar Azam and Fakhar Zaman performed well against England
 main in khiladinnon kii tulana duniya ke duusare ballebaajon se nahin kar rahaa lekin inase pakistan ko kaaphi ummiden hai
 All three top order batsmen do not have much experience but all three are good batsmen
 vishwa cap main inaki macurity kaa imtihaan bhi hoga
 This question you will be asked often is that Pakistan has always faced defeat against India in the history of World Cup
 is baar bhi is baat kaa koi manovaigyanik phayda bhartiya team ko milegaa?main isse sahamat nahin
 There will definitely be a feeling among the Pakistani players that we have never won from India in the World Cup
 lekin saath hi saath yah chahat bhi hogi ki is 'jinks' ko todaa jaae
 If you talk about the entire World Cup, the kind of pitches you are seeing in the opening matches, is this the fight of the batsmen? stadium main aane vaale phens ko majaa aae, isliye batting wicket taiyaar kiye gaye hai
 In the ODI series played between Pakistan and England before the World Cup, there were also consistently high scores
 wicket par bilkul ghaas nahin he
 The white ball seam has also been tapered
 isse vah pehle se kam seem or swing hoti he
 In an ideal situation it is wrong because the bowlers look absolutely helpless but in terms of fans it is good
 is vishwa cap main formet bhi alag he
 The top 4 teams have to play semi-finals
 asian tiimon kii kya sambhaavna he?asian tiimon main bharat or pakistan kii timen acha karengi
 Pakistan has not started well but they showed their strength by defeating England
 bharat ke khilaaf wo final bhi khel sakati he
 Apart from Asian teams, Australia and England teams will also remain in the top 4
 newjiland kii team par bhi najar rahegi

 He said that in the event of the formation of a joint board, Shia and Sunni members would be nominated according to the percentage of Waqf properties therein

 Meanwhile, Shia Waqf Board Chairman Wasim Rizvi said in response to Raza's statement that Shia and Sunni Waqf Boards have been formed in April 2015

 There is no such provision in the Waqf Act that the Board be dissolved on the go
 jab board kaa samay khatm ho jaae, tab sarkaar jaanch karaae ki kiske kitne vakf hai or unki aamadani kya he
 He said that the Waqf Act has also said that at least 15 percent of the Waqf Board's total revenue should be contributed
 agar hussainabad trust kii aamadani ko shaamil kar diya jaae to kul aay main shiya vakf board kii hissedari 15 pratishat se zyada ho jaaegi
 The matter is currently pending in court

 Raza said that according to the Central Waqf Council, the Uttar Pradesh Shia Waqf Board has only three thousand Waqf units

 Having separate presidents, chief executive officers and other staff is wasteful

 Although the family members of Reema wanted to teach him further, but acting fever was so much dominating Reema's head that he did not listen to anyone
 iske liye unke ghar kaa maahaul hi jimmedaar tha
 Actually, Reema's mother Mandakini Bhadbhade was an old Marathi actress who used to do theater and Marathi films

 He ventured into Hindi and Marathi films from the 1970s to the 80s, where he met Marathi actor Vivek Lagoo

 It was only after marriage that her name was changed to Reema

 ek golf ke maidan main aaraam se match chal rahaa tha
 Players were playing and spectators were enjoying the match
 tabhi ek khilaadi ko kuch gadabad mahasoos hui
 When he looked nearby, he saw a dragon nurturing a small Australian kangaroo type of creature (wallaby)
 darasal shanivaar ko uttari queensland main cairsn ke paradise palmas course maidan main yah golf match chal rahaa tha
 At the same time a player named Robert Willemsey heard a voice near the 17th hole
 usne dekha ki ek chaar meter (13 foot) ke ajgar ne ek walbi ko daboch rakhaa he or usko nigalane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 He immediately photographed the encounter and called his companions
 usne bataaya, ''maine baad main logon se suna
 
 
 Several golfers and ground staff members came and looked at the manger and told that he had successfully swallowed his prey and swallowed it and then moved to the nearby bushes
 '' He told that it seems that the dragon came down from a tree and made Wallabi its victim
 uske mutabik ek saanp kabhi is tarah khule main hamalaa karne main samarth nahin hoga
 It seems that this dragon jumped from a nearby tree on its prey
 donon ke bich bich maidan main sangharsh hua or ant main ajgar niwala banane main kaamyaab hua
 It is worth mentioning that in Australia this type of dragon is one of the longest snake species and it is 8
 5 meter tak lanbaa ho saktaa he
 He saw that a four-meter (13-foot) dragon caught a wallaby and was trying to swallow it
 usne tatkaal us muthbhed kii photo khinchi or apane saathiyon ko bulaayaa
 He told, "I heard from people later

 '' usne bataaya ki aisa lagata he ki ek ped se neeche utarkar us ajgar ne walbi ko apana shikaar banaaya
 According to him, a snake will never be able to attack in the open like this
 aisa lagata he ki yah ajgar paas ke ek ped se apane shikaar par kuuda
 The two clash in the middle ground and eventually the dragon manages to make a morsel
 ullekhneey he ki australia main is kism kaa ajgar sabase lambii saanp kii prajatiyon main se ek hota he or yah 8

 The US, which is better prepared than India to deal with such security threats, has issued a warning about two Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE
 america kii house permanent select cameti on intelligence (khufia maamalon par sadan kii sthaayee chayan samiti) ne 8 aktubar, 2012 kii ek report main kaha he, ''in companiyon par yah bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa ki ve videshi prabhaav se mukt hai or is tarah se ve america or hamaari vyavastha ke liye khatra hai
 "the committee has told the American intelligence community to" be vigilant and keep an eye on this threat
 '' kareeb 11 maheene kii jaanch ke baad taiyaar is report main vaise to abhi chini doorsanchaar companiyon ko puri tarah doshi nahin tehraaya gaya he, lekin isamen yah jarur kaha gaya he ki unka china sarkaar or sena ke saath sampark he
 In March this year, Australia did not allow Huawei to participate in its $ 38 billion broadband tender
 britain ne kaha he ki vah british telecom or huwavei ke rishton kii jaanch kar rahaa he
 In the same month, Canada barred Huawei from bidding for contracts for secure communications networks, citing national security
 bharat kii sashastr senaaon or khufia agenciyon ne varsh 2007 se hi baar-baar huwavei technology or jedtii ko laal jhandi dikhaai he, haalanki ve kabhi-kabhaar hi ekarey hoti hai
 Huawei, which came to India in 2000 and made its headquarters in Gurgaon, occupies more than 60 percent of the Indian telecom sector
 bhartiya doorsanchaar companiyaan huwavei ke pralobhan ko nazarandaaj nahin kar paatin: iskaa telecom hardware (router, switch aadi) anya pratispardhi companiyon ke mukaable 25 fisadi sasta he

 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki huwavei ko china sarkaar kaa samarthan hasil he, isaki vajah se hi vah kaaphi saste daron par boli lagaati he
 Indian intelligence agencies have issued repeated warnings about Huawei's intrusion into India's telecommunications system
 unki sabase badi ashanka yah he ki chini companiyaan bhartiya network main ghuspaith karne ke liye trogen horse (is malware ke madhyam se haikar computaron tak pahunch sakate hai) ban sakati hai
 Similarly during wartime, these companies can disable the entire Indian network through remote 'kill switches', 'chor darwaz' and malicious computer programs
 huwavei ko lekar aapatti isliye bhi he kyonki iske sansthaapak-chairman rain jhengphei ke piele ke saath gahare rishte hai

 2007 se hi khufia agenciyon ne baar-baar grih mantralay, doorsanchaar mantralay or pradhanmantri karyaalay tak in chintaaon ko pahunchaaya, lekin doorsanchaar mantri kapil sibbal ne inhen khaarij kar diya
 He said at a press conference in June 2011 that Huawei had offered to show the ministry its software architecture and design
 sibbal ne kaha tha, ''darane kii koi baat nahin he
 "but a senior member of the Indian security establishment says," The government has to strike a balance between security and economic concerns
 ''huwavei india ke pravaktaa suresh rangarajan in ashankaon ko niraadhaar bataate hue kehete hai, ''suraksha ke maamle main ham samasya nahin, balki samaadhaan kaa hissaa hai
 First of all we had offered to tell our source code to the Government of India and we have actively cooperated with the government on all aspects
 '' huwavei ne ek bayaan main kaha he ki rain jhengphei sena se kai dashak pehle ritair ho gaye the, uske baad unhone swatantra rup se huwavei kii sthapana kii
 He has only one per cent stake in the company, the rest of the shares have been given to about 65,000 employees of the company through a public trust
 ek khufia adhikari ne bataaya ki bhartiya agenciyon ke paas puraa chip padhgaye or kisi sthapit trepadorce yaa malware kaa pataa lagane ke liye ''upkarnon, jaankaree yaa samarthy kaa abhaav he isliye, ''yah andeh rahata he ki jab koi chip net se joda jayega to isse chupe protocol ko lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 In 2006, Chinese President Jiang Zemin coined a new term, calling on the PLA to be prepared for future wars
 unhone kaha ki aise yuddh 'informatigeshan' ke halaat main hone chahie, jisamen technology ko saadhan ke rup main istemaal karte hue sanyukt rup se ladaa janaa chahie
 China has invested in astonishing array of new weapons along with covert cyber attacks such as anti-satellite missiles (electromagnetic weapons to destroy communications networks) and aircraft carriers that can carry deadly missiles
 ye hathiyaar vaise to america ko daraane ke liye taiyaar kiye gaye hai, lekin isse bhartiya yojanakaaron kii chintaa bhi bad gai he
 This concern has forced the issuance of warnings of potential attacks on infrastructure
 sarkaar kitni chintit he, yah 31 july, 2012 ko saaf ho gaya, jab power grid thap hone se kareeb 60 karod bhartiya prabhavit hue
 a team of experts from the National Technical Research Organization (NTRO), working under National Security Advisor (NSA) Shivshankar Menon, immediately reached the National Load Dispatch Center in South Delhi to find out whether it was a cyber attack
 aise sanket to nahin mili, lekin visheshgyon ko yah andaja jarur lag gaya ki sainya sankat ke daur main kya ho saktaa he
 Cisco-associated cyber expert Arif Shoukey said, "cyber warfare is a serious threat because over the years it has been seen that there has always been a cyber war before the military war — the war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 and Georgia in 2008
 The attacks of Russian hackers are examples of this
 '' seemaa par yuddh kii sambhaavna ab dhoomil padati ja rahi he, jisase sibar hamalaa zyada aakarshak ho gaya he

 Similarly, on December 15, 2009, a cyber attack was carried out targeting the PMO
 iske tahat piemo ke kai varisht adhikariyon ko ek sankramit peedief dastavej i-mail kiya gaya
 - In 2010 suspected Chinese bombers targeted the computers of top officials of the nsa's office, air force and navy and stole a number of secret documents and presentations
 khufia agenciyon kaa kahana he ki paristhitijanya saakshyon se yahi sanket miltaa he ki ye hamale china se kiye gaye
 The 2010 attacks revealed that they were carried out by a group of hackers based in Chengdu, China
 lekin internet kii bikhri hui prakruti ko dekhte hue (aise hamale aksar kisi tisare desh ke sarwar se kiye jate hai) hamalon main lipt logon ko sidhe doshi tehraana kathin hota he
 Indian intelligence officials believe that this espionage venture is actually part of a larger plan to scour India's entire cyber network, create a database about vulnerabilities and put malware in computers
 ek computer export kehete hai, ''yah ek anoothaa yuddh he jisamen malware yaa sleeping solgers ko yuddh shuru hone se pehle hi dushman ke ilaake main bhej diya jaataa he
 The computers of the New Delhi Railway Station were also the target of a cyber attack carried out by an unknown hacker group from Chengdu

 Cyber espionage attacks on Indian computers are continuing and they are becoming increasingly sophisticated

 ''desh main vyapak sibar suraksha niti nahin he or net par nigaraanee ke liye ek bhi agency nahin he
 The Computer Emergency Response team-india (CERT-IN), working under the Department of Telecommunications and IT, is the apex agency for computer attacks
 iske mahanideshak, jo bharat ke mukhya soochna suraksha adhikari bhi hai, ke paas sirf 40 karmchaaree hai
 NTRO has only 90 employees to protect critical cyber resources from attacks

 sibar yuddh se nipatane ke liye bani inamen se koi bhi ikai ek-duusare se baat nahin karti
 How scattered the operations of these agencies can be gauged from the fact that recently two agencies hacked the same foreign military website within a few days
 ek or khufia agency ne fasebuk par kaaphi mehnat se ek jaal bichaaya (unhone charampanthiyon par najar rakhane ke liye ek bharat virdohi website banaai), lekin kuch samay baad usne paaya ki uski website ko doorsanchaar vibhaag ne block kar diya he
 This website could be resumed when the detectives of the agency ran and reached the Telecom Ministry, but by then much damage had been done

 Excavation is on in search of treasure in Daundia Kheda village of Unnao
 khudaai shuru hone ke teen din baad orcyological survey of india (eesai) ko kuch ummid najar aane lagi he
 The corner of a wall is seen on the excavation of about three feet in the fort
 or eesai ko ummid he ki is diwaar ke paar sone kaa khajaana mil saktaa he
 The fort, which was built inside the fort and the fort, was not interested until yesterday, now the secret of that fort has started deepening and the interest of the people has also started awakening
 yahaan khudaai main juty eesai kii team ke chehre par khushi chhalakane lagi he
 When the excavation was started in the fort of Raja Rao Ram Bakhsh Singh of Unnao at 10 am on the third day, there was no sign of ancient civilization attached to the fort
 jaise-jaise khudaai hoti gai orcyological survey of india kii team ke chehre kii maayusi badhati gai, lekin shaam hote-hote achaanak hi team kaa cheharaa khil gaya
 10 more laborers hired The ASI team was digging 12 workers for two days
 usne das or majdoor kaam par laga die hai
 And scientists have started getting the results of the excavation
 tisare din khudaai ke baad gadde main ek diwaar najar ai he
 This wall is about one meter below the ground
 or eesai ko lagata he ki ye diwaar pracheen kaal kii ho sakati he
 Currently, the width of the wall is seen to be two feet, but it is expected that the wall will be seen full size after cleaning around it
 saath hi kile ke us rahasy se bhi pardaa uthegaa, jo jameen ke neeche rahasy ke saat pardon main dafn he
 Everyone's eyes are towards the fort and these three questions revolve in the mind - first - Will the treasure come out of the fort? Second - Will one thousand tons of gold be found? Third - Will a monk's dream come true? a thousand in the mind of the government Sadhu Shobhan Sarkar, who awakened the dream of tons of gold, has claimed that one thousand tons of gold is buried under 25 feet of the ground
 eesai kii team 3 foot khudaai kar chuki he
 Now the question is arising that the ASI team will reach the treasury by reaching across this wall? Because before that the team has got tile and bricks
 eesai kii team ko lagata he ki uskaa mishan sahi disha main ja rahaa he or ab khajaane ke sone se pardaa uthte der nahin lagegi
 The king buried gold before his death! This is perhaps the first time in history when a government agency, the Archeology Survey of India, is engaged in the search for such a treasure
 is agency ko talash he sone ke aise bhandar kii, jise ek raja ne marane se pehle jameen main dafna diya tha
 On Monday, the agency will once again try to reach that treasure
 eesai kii team ko khudaai se pehle hi pataa chalaa tha ki is jagah par kareeb 25 feet neeche kisi dhaatu kaa jakhira ho saktaa he
 And this metal is also a metal that is not attracted to the magnet
 to saaf he ki wo dhaatu loha nahin, kuch or he
 Gold can also occur
 wo hajaar ton sona
 On Monday, the ASI will try to find the corner of the wall
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki diwaar ke aakaar ke aadhaar par jameen ke neeche jo dhaancha milegaa

 What is it? This is perhaps the first time in the entire history that the ASI is digging in a treasure hunt and this is also the first time that the department has laid the foundation of a monk's dream, not science
 darasal, kanpur dehaat main rahane vaale shobhan sarkaar ne ek sapana dekha tha
 In the fort of Rao Ram Baksh Singh in Daundia Kheda village of Unnao, thousands of tonnes of gold have been buried
 or raja ne sadhu ko uski hifaazat karne ko kaha
 What did the monk tell this dream to the UPA minister
 ek upekshit kila or upekshit gaanv surkhiyon main aa gaya he
 The search for the Mahakhajane has begun
 lekin ye sawaal abhi tak atka he ki yah khajaana aakhir kiskaa he
 Some say that this treasure belongs to Raja Rao Rama Bakhsh Singh, and some are calling it the treasure of Peshwa Bajirao
 saadhe 6 sau saal puraani riyasat dondia kheda ke jameendaar visheshwar singh ke bete professor laal amarendra singh ke mutabik ye khajaana ram baksh ke purvaj maharaj trilokchand kaa he
 According to Professor Lal Amarendra Singh, this treasure was collected by Maharaj Trilokchand, who ruled here in the 16th century
 mahakhajane ko kile kii deevaaron main bhi chipaaya gaya ho saktaa he
 This is the claim of Professor Lal Amarendra Singh
 is khajaane kaa ek nakshaa bhi he, jise raja ram baksh nen apni maa ke paas chhod diya tha
 There are several reasons behind this claim
 maharaja trilok chand yahaan ke sabase pratapi raja hue, jinhen ilaake main vaishyon kaa sabase pratapi raja kaha jaataa tha
 Trilok Chand was associated with Emperor Lodi of Delhi
 inke alaava mainpuri ke raja sumer shah chouhan bhi behalol lodi se jude huye the
 Apart from Unnao, the rule of Trilokchand extended to Bahraich, Kannauj, Barabanki and Lakhimpur Kheri
 isiilie mana ja rahaa he ki itnaa bada khajaana maharaja trilokchand kaa ho saktaa he
 The temple near the fort of Daundiyakheda village was built by Raja Ravram Bakhsh Singh, while the shikhar of the temple was erected and sculpted in 1932 by the zamindar Visheshwar Singh
 diwali ke din aap or ham apane parivaar ke saath tyohaar kaa khub anand lete hai
 But have you ever thought that there are many people around you who are unable to celebrate the festival
 kaaran rupayon kii tangi nahin he or na hi dharm se judaa koi maamla he
 Atar Singh, who lives in Delhi, has celebrated Diwali with his family only once in the last 25 years
 vajah? vah yahaan ke agnishman daste main shaamil hai or is vajah se unhen diwali par chuttee nahin milti
 The man posted at Bhikaji Cama Place in South Delhi said, 'I have been working in the fire department for 25 years
 is lambi avadhi main maine sirf ek baar apane parivaar ke saath diwali manaai he
 'only Attar Singh is not the only person who cannot celebrate Diwali
 samooche shahar main pulicekarmi, aspataal ke karmchaaree or aavashyak seva pradaata karmchaariyon kii badi sankhya he jinhen diwali kaa jashn manaane kaa mauka nahin mil paata
 a constable posted at an intersection near Hauz Khas in south Delhi said, 'we celebrate Diwali along the road with fellow policemen
 ' usne kaha, 'hamaare bacchon ko hamaari kami bahut khalati he, lekin ve yaa ham kar hi kya sakate hai?'ek anya pulicekarmi ne sweekaar kiya ki diwali na manaane se uski bhavanaaen aahat hoti hai
 It is a festival which is celebrated by people of all religions, but it is deprived of it year after year
 ek anya agnishmankarmi shyaam sharan ne bhi sweekaar kiya ki parivaar ke saath diwali na manaane kaa gam use bahut sataata he
 He said, 'but some people have to work
 ham 24 ghante duty par rahete hai
 'similarly, the agony of doctors and nurses working in hospitals is no different

 ' The market for noodles, which claims to satisfy people's hunger in two minutes, may get another major setback
 beete dinon 'megi' par bavaal ke baad ab yoga guru ramdev dwaara haal hi launch kiya gaya 'patanjali aataa noodles' vivaadon main he
 The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) says that the yoga guru's company has not taken the necessary approvals before launching the noodles
 patanjali kii safaibaba ramdev ke pravaktaa esake tijaarwaala ne kaha ki aataa noodles ke maamle main pantajali ne FSSAI ke niyamon kaa ulanghan nahin kiya he
 He issued a press release saying that we have got pasta license in the central category from FSSAI and as per the definition of FSSAI, noodles are covered under pasta
 dilachasp baat yah he ki jahaan ek ore FSSAI ke adhikari ne apruval nahin die jane kii baat kahi he, vahiin 'patanjali aataa noodles' ke packet par FSSAI kii ore se diya gaya license number chapa hua he
 FSSAI chairman Ashish Bahuguna told the English newspaper 'indian Express',' Patanjali Atta Noodles has not received any approval from us
 is babat mujhe jaankaree mili he or ham iske khilaaf kaam kar rahe hai
 Bahuguna is also taking over as the Chief Executive Officer of FSSAI
 gauratlab he ki 'megi' noodles par bain ke thik baad yoga guru ramdev ne noodles bazaar main dastak dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 On Monday, his company Patanjali launched 'aata Noodles' in the market, whose license number 10014012000266 has been printed on the packet by FSSAI
 bahuguna kehete hai, 'jis product ko apruv hi nahin kiya gaya he, use license number kaise mil saktaa he? rajya sarkaar kisi bhi product ke liye manuphaccharing license detii he, lekin iske liye jaruri apruval FSSAI dwaara diya jaataa he
 But when Patanjali atta noodles were not approved, how did they get the license number? main nahin jaanata ki license kaise mila
 'what to say Patanjali Ayurved Kadusari Ore, Yoga Guru Ramdev spokesperson SK Tijarwala says on this whole controversy,' There is no restriction on getting a separate license to launch noodles as per rules issued by FSSAI in August this year is
 jab hamaare paas puure kagajaat aa jaaenge to ham is ore aage jawaab denge
 According to FSSAI sources, Ramdev's company Patanjali Ayurved Limited is an FMCG venture and has not yet applied for approval of noodles
 FSSAI ke ek adhikari kahat hai, 'hamen nahin pataa noodles main kya he?' FSSAI food licencing or registration system kii jaankaree ke mutabik, patanjali ayurveda limited ke food park or herbal park ko jin chizon ke manuphaccharing kii anumati he, unamem noodles shaamil nahin he

 So the RSS has declared in a tweet that all "issues in the society" should be resolved through cordial dialogue? i suppose either Modiji and his government no longer respect the rss's views or they don't believe that there is an "issue" in Jammu and Kashmir Interesting
