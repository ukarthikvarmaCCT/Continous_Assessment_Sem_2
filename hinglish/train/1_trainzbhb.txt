 It was no surprise for fans to see their favorite actors in the typical look in these films
 box offis par bhi in filmon ne kamai ke lihaaj se bhi acha bijness kiya jisaki vajah se film samikshakon kii bhi bolti band ho gai thi
 One thing that was common in all these films was producer Rahul Mitra
 Review: kamjor script or kharaab suspence se bhari he 'dear maaya'haal hi main relies hui film 'dear maaya' ko bhi produsar rahul mitra
 Rahul is very happy with the response to the film 'dear Maya'
 ek intervyuu main produsar rahul mitra ne bataaya - 'industry main mujhe 8 saal se zyada time ho gaya, shuru se hi main contint kaa fain rahaa hum, acchhee filmein acchhee scrupt log bina film dekhe hi soongh lete hai
 As a producer i knew that the story of 'dear Maya' is quite entertaining
 'aaj jab 'bahubali' jaisi filmein bollywood main 1500 karod rupye tak kaa profit kama raheen hai jisane diarectors or produsron kii naak main dam kar rakhaa he
 The low budget film Dear Maya is also earning well
 aise main produsar rahul mitra ke liye film kii kamyaabi kaa paimaana thodaa alag myne rakhata he
 Rahul said- 'it is not a matter of 100 crores
 kabhi kabhi bajet filmon ko banaata bhi he or bigaadta bhi he
 Leading age heroines should also get lead roles: Manisha Koirala if the cost of production of a film is 80 crores and if she earns 100 crores then what is the benefit
 'dear maaya' rhite bajet main baniin he
 Landing cost of any film must be correct, there is a fixed budget, who can recover their cost, then if there is some profit on it, the success rate of the film is known
 'sahib bivi or gangster frenchise kii third instolment lekar rahul bahut jald phens ke bich honge

 Rajni's image in the cinema is also such that she is invincible
 ve kuch bhi kar sakate hai or unhen kuch nahin ho saktaa
 Rajani's diwans are also sure of this and perhaps that is the reason that when they were admitted in the hospital, the confidence of their fans was shaken

 Rajinikanth's kidney had temporarily stopped functioning
 yahi he vah vishwaas or prem, jo rajnikant ne duniya bhar main apane karodon prashansakon ke bich arjeet kiya he
 The news and rumors about this superstar lying weak and helpless on the hospital bed at the moment seem unrealistic

 Have you ever seen a phone that has a curvature or elasticity in the screen
 guuruuvaar ko pehali baar duniya ghumaavdaar disple vaala duniya kaa pehla smartphone dekhegi
 The name of this new Samsung phone is 'galaxy Round'
 guuruuvaar se korea ke bazaar main yah phone uplabdh ho jayega
 The price will be around $ 1000
 baaki deshon main yah phone kab launch hoga, is bare main koi faisla abhi nahin liya gaya he
 Wearable devices to be built in future In addition to this phone, Samsung has come closer to making such devices with 'flexible and Unbreakable' screens which can also be worn
 alji or appal jaisi companiyon se takkar lene main 'karvd screen' samsung ke liye turup kaa ikkaa sabit ho sakati he
 However, according to experts, this phone has been brought only to launch the curved screen
 ghumaavdaar screen ke alaava iske baaki fitures kuch khaas nahin hai, isliye iske hit hone kii ummid kam hi he
 How the Round Features Hangalaxy rounds are very similar to the Galaxy Note

 Phone screen 5
 7 inch kii he
 Phone thickness 7
 9 millimetre he
 The display is full HD
 vajan 154 gram he, jo gallexi note 3 se thodaa kam he
 There is a function through which you will be able to get information about missed calls and battery life even when the home screen is closed
 iske alaava screen ke daaen yaa baayen taraf dabaakar bhi media file scrol kar sakenge
 There will also be a curved battery? Now the company has to clear how the parts of the curved screen phone will be made in low cost and on a large scale
 in phone kii bydaree bhi bilkul nae andaaj main saamne aa sakati he
 However the Galaxy Round battery is not curved
 yah muqabla abhi or tej hone vaala he kyonki sutron ke mutabik november ke pehle hafte main alji bhi ghumaavdaar disple vaala smartphone lekar aa rahaa he
 The US and China have come face-to-face to declare the dreaded terrorist Masood Azhar a global terrorist
 jahaan america, france, britain or bharat samet kai desh aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatankwaadiyon kii suchi main shaamil karaane kii sabhi koshishen kar rahe hai, to china or pakistan usko bachaane main jute hue hai
 China continues to thwart international efforts to declare Masood a global terrorist
 china masood ko bachaane ke liye ab tak chaar baar vito power kaa istemaal kar chukaa he
 Now that the US is again bringing a proposal to the Security Council to include Masood Azhar in the list of global terrorists, China is shocked and warned
 china aatanki masood ajahar ke liye america se bhidane ko taiyaar ho gaya he
 It has also accused the US of forcibly proposing against Masood Azhar
 haalanki america ke is prastaav ko france or britain kaa bhi samarthan praapt he
 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the US is bypassing the 1267 Sanctions Committee and bringing the resolution directly to the Security Council
 yah baatcheet ke madhyam se mudde ko sulajhane kaa sahi tarika nahin he
 During a media briefing of the Foreign Ministry in Beijing, the Chinese spokesman said that this move by the US would undermine the authority of the important anti-terrorism 1267 Sanctions Committee of the Security Council
 unhone kaha, 'yah prastaav laane kaa sahi tarika nahin he or vaishvik ekajutata ke anuroop nahin he
 This will only complicate the issue
 lihaaja ham america se apil karte hai ki wo satarkta se kaam le or jabaran prastaav ko aage badhaane se bache
 'earlier Masood has been obstructed four times on attempts to declare Azhar a global terrorist
 aapako bataa den ki jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main siarpief ke kafile par hue aatanki hamale ke baad america, france or britain ne masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit karne ke liye suraksha parishad main prastaav laayaa tha
 However, China had blocked the attempt to declare Masood Azhar a global terrorist
 isko lekar america, france or britain ne kadi pratikriya di thi
 40 CRPF personnel were killed in Pulwama terror attack
 is aatanki hamale kii jimmedaari masood ajahar ke sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ne lee thi
 After this, the Indian Air Force entered Balakot in Pakistan and carried out an air strike on the jaish-e-mohammed's terrorist bases
 isamen kaaphi sankhya main aatankiyon ke maare jane kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 At the same time, Pakistan's air force attack in the Indian territory, buoyed by this action of the Indian Air Force, also gave a befitting reply and killed Pakistan's F-16 fighter aircraft
 america ne pehali baar suraksha parishad ko sidhe bheja prastaavsamyukt raashtra ke sutron ne samachar agency pitiai ko bataaya ki pehali baar buudhvaar ko america, britain or france ne masood ajahar kaa naam blike list main daalane ke liye sidhe suraksha parishad main ek masauda prastaav bheja he
 Such a proposal does not come under any no-objection provision
 agar masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatanki kii suchi main shaamil kar liya jaataa he, to uski yatra par pratibandh lag jayega or uski sampatti jabt kar lee jaaegi

 puure pradesh main chunaav prachaar najar aata tha
 Huge amount was spent in election campaigns
 kai gadiyon, rickshon par laud spikar se prachaar hua karata tha
 The Election Commission started taking some drastic measures when things came to light about the waste of money and buying votes on the basis of notes
 nishpaksh chunaavon kii khatir is baar chunaav ayog ne kai sakht kadam uthaae
 This time the election spending limit has been kept at 28 lakh
 chunaav ayog kii sakhti ke chalate pichley kuch saalon ke pehle vaala chunavi maahaul ab bilkul badal chukaa he
 However, one of the reasons for this may be the rapidly changing digital trend and rising inflation, as now more publicity is done in elections through other means than field campaign
 mobile miseging, campan kol ke alaava fasebuk, twitor or watsape par in dinon jamkar prachaar ho rahaa he
 In this entire exercise, there was a loss of those printers and traders who used to do business of election materials
 aaj ham aapako kuch aisi hi chunaav samagriyon se rou-ba-rou karvaa rahe hai jo ab virale hi dekhne ko milti hai
 Flags / flags: Activists of political parties put up flags and flags in the vicinity of the venue before the rally and public meetings
 in dinon simit chunavi kharch ke chalate yah sthal ke aasapaas hi najar aate hai varanaa ek daur tha ki chunaav aate hi puraa shahar jhande-jhandiyon se pat jaataa tha
 Button stickers / badlabton stickers and cats were the most crazed within children
 chunaav prachaar main lagi gadiyon ke peeche daudte bachche tarah-tarah ke stikar or bille ikattha karte the
 Election badges were also seen on the clothes of the leaders
 aaj ke daur main ab yah gaayab hi ho chukaa he
 However, the Prime Minister of the country, Narendra Modi, has often been seen in election rallies wearing a BJP badge
 pampletapampalate main rajnatik partiyaan apane chunavi agenda ke saath-saath pratyaashee ko jitaane kii fariyaad karti thim
 Electoral vehicles used to distribute pumplets in different areas
 ab inaki sankhya bhi kaaphi simit ho gai he
 The caps / mask caps were also used to woo the children as well as the youth
 garmiyon main hone vaale chunaav prachaaron main ye partiyon ke liye kaaphi mufeed hoti thim
 Apart from this, masks are also quite popular
 partiyaan apane bade netaaon ke mukhauton kaa istemaal bhi chunaav prachaar main khub karti ai hai
 The masks of Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi are quite visible these days
 katoutakatout kaa istemaal chunavi reliyon or prachaar vaahanon par kiya jaataa tha
 But now they have been replaced by Flax Printing
 katout mahange hone ke saath-saath bahut hi zyada dekh-rekh maangate the jabaki flax saste hone ke saath iji tu kairi hote hai
 Key-rings / belts / pens / t-shirts / umbrellas / mobile covers In earlier elections, the parties used to campaign for their campaign by putting a mark of election or candidate on various useful things
 maahaul or mausam ko dhyaan main rakhte hue in chizon kaa order diya jaataa tha
 Key parties such as key rings, belts, pens, T-shirts, umbrellas and mobile covers were distributed by political parties
 haalanki inamen se kuch chijen to abhi bhi najar aa jaati hai lekin ab inkaa istemaal simit ho gaya he
 Phatka / Mufflerftka is the most preferred of politicians for election campaigning
 lagbhag sabhi partiyon ke netaa chunaav prachaar ke dauraan apane-apane chunaav chinh vaale fatke gale main latakaae najar aa jaaenge
 However, the fashion of Phatak is still intact
 aise hi mafalar bhi sadabahaar hai
 Like the Hand Bandfatak, young leaders like the Hand Band quite a lot
 fatka jahaan gale main pahana jaataa he to hand band haath kii kalai main

 There have been some recent cases in Madhya Pradesh in which women implicated men in false cases of rape
 ek maamle main indore ke ek nirdosh vyakti ne aatmahatya tak kar lee
 a recent case is that of Peretha village in Burhanpur district
 yahaan ke 38 varshiya janshikshak raamalaal akhande par gaanv kii ek mahila ne balaatkaar kaa jhootha maamla darj karavaaya tha
 Everything changed for Ramlal after being accused
 unhen jo log sammaan se dekha karte the, unki hi najaron main ab unke liye ghrinaa tapak rahi thi
 In newspapers, there was a lot of news from the 'rapist Jan Shikshakar' heading and not only the villagers but their loved ones also turned against them
 raamalaal bataate hai, ‘‘kai dinon tak ghar se baahar nikalne kii himmat hi nahin hui, aatmahatya kaa vichaar bhi aayaa lekin parijan saath the isliye himmat bani rahi
 In this case, the police promptly got a DNA test done, which proved that the allegations against them were false
 unke maathe par laga kalank dhul gaya or sabakuch saamaanya ho gaya
 Ramlal, who burns milk, now drinks buttermilk too
 un par mahilaon kaa aisa khauf haaavee ho gaya he ki mobile par bhi mahila kii aawaaj sunai de jaae to ve ghabara jate hai
 Even in the bus do not sit on the seat next to any woman
 burhanpur ke police adheekshak avinaash sharma bataate hai, ‘‘19 janvari ko paretha gaanv kii vaijayanti manoj yaduwanshi ne shikaayat darj karwaai thi ki raamalaal akhande ne beeti raat uske saath balaatkaar kiya he
 "but Sharma found the incident suspicious
" isaki vajah yah thi ki vaijayanti kaa pati manoj yaduwanshi gaanv kii hi ek ladki se balaatkaar ke aarope main pichley disambar se jail main tha
 Ramlal is the Kaka of that rape victim girl
 police ko shuruyaat main hi lag gaya tha ki duusare paksh par dabaav banane kii niyat se yah aarope lagaaya gaya he
 Therefore, along with conducting medical examination of the accused woman, Ramlal's DNA test was also done
 mahila ke sharir yaa kapadon par veery kaa koi ansh nahin paaya gaya
 This report was sufficient for Ramlal's innocence
 khakanar thana prabharee sanjeev nayan sharma bataate hai, ‘‘is report ke baad raamalaal ke khilaaf balaatkaar ke jhuthe maamle kaa khaatmaa kar diya gaya
 a case under IPC and the Atrocity Act was registered against Vyjayanthi Yaduvanshi, her brother-in-law Anand Singh Yaduvanshi and brother Ramswaroop for filing false reports
 ’’lekin indore ke 50 varshiya rupakishor agarwal kii kismat raamalaal jitani acchhee nahin thi
 His tenants, Chanchal and Sunil Rathore, 33, had filed a rape case on December 26 at the Palasiya police station
 is maamle main police ne agarwal kaa paksh jane bagaiyr hi unhen giraftaar liya or jail bhej diya
 Aggarwal's wife Manjula says, "they kept screaming that they were innocent, their DNA should be tested but the police did not listen to them
" ve dhai maheene tak jail main rahe
 This had a very bad effect on his health
 ve depressant ke shikaar ho gaye
 He got bail on 8 March but was broken
 ro-rokar kehete the ki itane saalon main jo pratishtha hasil kii thi vah mitti main mil gai
 Meanwhile, during a court hearing on March 13, Chanchal admitted that he was not raped but a dispute of money transactions between Aggarwal and him
 balaatkaar kii juthi shikaayat par apper satr nyaayadhish savita dube behad naaraaz huin or unhone talkh tippanee karte hue kaha, ‘‘dilli gang rape ke baad kuch log galat phayda uthaa rahe hai
 This can hurt the feelings of the real victim
 ’’nyaayadhish ne jhootha aarope lagane vaali chanchal ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kaa bhi aadesh diya
 But even a clean chit from the court could not take Aggarwal out of shock and he committed suicide by hanging himself on 17 March
 suicide note main bhi unhone apni maut kaa jimmedaar chanchal or sunil rathore ko tehraaya
 According to Manjula, Chanchal and Sunil were his tenants
 unhone gaadi kharidne ke liye agarwal se karj liya tha lekin ve na to makaan kaa kiraaya chukaa rahe the or na hi karj adaa kar rahe the
 When Aggarwal pressed for money and asked to vacate the house, the Rathore couple hatched this conspiracy
 manjula aarope lagaati hai ki rathore dampati ne bayaan badalane ke evaj main unase 20 lakh ru
 Demand was given to give or house his name and to end the loan
 manjula ke shabdon main, ‘‘mere pati bahut ghabara gaye the
 So he spent Rs 3 lakh
 kaa karj maaf kar diya or 12 march ko makaan kii power of etorni bhi chanchal ke naam kar di
 Chanchal then changed the statement on 13 March
 lekin rathore kii paison kii maang jari rahi, jisase mere pati behad tanaav main aa gaye the
 "agarwal's 21-year-old daughter Shivani says," This is an example of how the laws made to protect women can be misused

 ) (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) is desh main ek se ek farzi log guzare
 Some are called Natwarlal and some become Harshad Mehta
 or kisi ko duniya charles shobhraj ke naam se jaanati he
 But those we are talking about are two steps ahead of them
 kyonki inhone to farzivaade kaa nizaam hi badalakar rakh diya
 Some of them became policemen wearing real uniforms
 to koi united neshans kaa adhikari
 So someone was robbing people by becoming an IFS
 magar jab inaki pole khuli to pataa chalaa kii sabake sab farzi hai
 We are going to tell you the story of one such fraudster
 jo baqayada ipies adhikari banakar logon ko thag rahaa tha
 Recently, many such names came up who wrote a new text of cheating
 unamem raaj malhotra ipies, zoya khanavikush, harsh pratap singh UNO council ofisar or sandip sharma disipi, haryana police ke naam shaamil hai
 All this is fake, sir
 ycard bhi farzi
 Name plate is also fake
 vardi par laga billaa bhi farzi
 This is Natwarlal
 natvarlaal isliye kyonki farzi sarkari adhikari banakar ye uske rasookh kaa hi phayda nahin uthaate the
 Rather, people used to put millions of crores
 natvarlaal number-1 niklaa raaj malhotra
 This person not only wore fake IPS uniform as a fake IPS, but he also used to stay in full effect
 jab ise giraftaar kiya gaya to bhaisahab phul dress main the
 IPS badge
 nem plate jis par inkaa naam bhi likhaa tha raaj malhotra
 According to the police, this racket was continuing for many years
 ab tak naa jane kitne bhole bhaale logon ko ye apane ipies hone kii hanak main lut chukaa tha
 But his sham came when a girl lodged a complaint with the police
 darasal, raaj malhotra naam kaa ye shaks ek gym main jaaya karata tha
 Where he met a girl
 ek saath gym karne kii vajah se donon main dosti ho gai
 The aggrieved girl acts as a sales girl in a show room
 jabaki raaj malhotra ne use bataaya tha ki wo ipies adhikari he
 He described himself as an ACP in North Delhi
 raaj malhotra ne dhire-dhire aadki se dosti kar lee
 Meanwhile, once Raj Malhotra introduced a young girl to the victim girl and claimed that she had adopted this girl
 iske baad donon kii dosti gahari ho gai
 Then one day Raj Malhotra told the girl that she is an IPS officer
 uski bade logon se jaan pahchaan he
 In such a situation, if his friend works as a salesgirl, it is not right
 lihaaza sarkari naukari dilaane ke naam par raaj malhotra ne ladki se ek lakh rupee thag liye
 And after taking the money, Raj Malhotra stopped meeting the girl
 jab ladki ko shaq hua to wo aaropee ke ghar pahunchin
 Seeing the condition of the house, the girl understood that she had been cheated
 lihaaza usne fouran aman vihaar police thane main pahunchakar is farzi ipies ke khilaaf shikaayat darj kara di
 The police immediately arrested Raj Malhotra on charges of cheating
 peedit ladki ko shaq isliye bhi hua kyonki raaj malhotra vardi main to nazar aata tha, magar kabhi sarkari gaadi main nahin dikhaa
 According to the police, Raj Malhotra has been caught once before in a case of fraud in 2013 also
 us vakt raaj sab inspector banakar rob dikhaakar thagi karne kii firaaq main tha
 But after getting released from jail, he did his promotion himself and started cheating people by becoming an IPS
 With all due respect sir, i beg to differ on the word “celebrate”, makes it seem like a favour on us Mumbaikars
 We hope it will really come
 It is our right compared to how much Mumbai gives to the centre each year vis a vis what we get in return

 Now in front of the police there was a corpse docked with the knives of a woman and the person who took the head for the murder was himself called on the spot
 gudgaanv kii us posh colony main hue katl ke kisse kaa khulaasa ek aise pati kaa tha jise apni bivi ke bevafa hone kaa shaq tha
 The resentment was natural but the way of expressing resentment was frightening
 laash ko postmortem ke liye bhejne ke baad rajnish kumaar singh ko police ne jis vakt apni hathkadiyon main jakadaaa uski god main ek das maheene kaa baccha tha, jabaki ek saat saal kii ladki uske kareeb khadi subak rahi thi
 The policeman Rajneesh has killed his wife Shweta and he himself has agreed to this by calling the police on the spot
 shweta ke jism par the chaaku ke kai ghaavkatl kii vaardaat ke baad maukey par pahunchi police ko flats se wo chaaku bhi mil gaya jisase shweta kii hatya kii gai, lekin police us vakt buree tarah chaunki jab usne shweta ke jism par chaakuon ke ghaav dekhe
 According to the police, Rajneesh himself told that he killed his wife by stabbing her with a knife in the kitchen of the house
 police ko die gaye bayaan main khud rajnish ne kabool kiya he ki wo tab tak chaaku se apni bivi par waar karata rahaa jab tak uskaa dam nahin nikal gaya
 The story of husband, wife and she had completely made up the house in Rajneesh that his wife was unfaithful to him and most of his time was spent with someone else
 is baat ko lekar donon ke bich aksar jhagade hone lage the
 On Sunday morning, there was a fight between the two and the cry during that quarrel also reached the neighboring flats
 lekin tab kisi ko gumaan bhi nahin tha ki ye cheekh pukaar khooni anjaam main tabdeel ho jaaegi
 Doubt is the poison that if dissolved in life, destroys it
 police kii tafteesh main khulaasa hua ki ranchi ke rahane vaale 44 saal ke rajnish ne im ahmedabad se management kii padhai kii
 Rajneesh met Shweta, who lives in Nahan, Himachal, about eight years ago, and both of them got married after the consent of the family members
 rajnish or shweta apane teen bacchon ke saath is socity ke flats main kareeb do maheene pehle hi rahane aae the
 It was suspected that Shweta had changed, Shweta ran a day care center in Phase Four of Gurgaon and had to meet many people in connection with this business
 lekin rajnish ko shaq hone laga tha ki shweta ab badal gai he or ek kaarobaari ke saath uski nazdikiyaan kaaphi bad gai hai
 This poison of suspicion increased the distance between husband and wife and there was frequent bickering in the house
 ravivaar kii subah jab rajnish ko ye pataa chalaa ki shweta usee shaks se milane jane vaali he to wo aape se baahar ho gaya or usne shweta kaa khun kar diya
 Rajnish had sent her daughter abroad to her brother with the help of avoiding the quarrel of the house, while a daughter was adopted by her relative
 lekin vaardaat vaale roj uskaa sabase chota betaa uske kareeb tha

 He had to satisfy himself with the bronze medal

 " bhopal gas traasadee ke mukhya aaropee warren anderson ke ghatana ke baad desh se faraar hone ke liye tatkaaleen pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi or madhyapradesh ke purv mukhyamantri ajarun singh ko jimmedaar tehraate hue bhaajapa ne isaki nishpaksh jaanch karaane kii maang kii he
 BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar told reporters why be it Quattrocchi or Warren Anderson, the attitude of Congress led by Sonia Gandhi is always soft towards foreigners
 sarkaar america dabaav main kyon kaam karti he
 He said that at the time when the Bhopal gas tragedy happened, there was a Congress government under the leadership of Rajiv Gandhi at the center while in Madhya Pradesh there was a Congress government led by Arjun Singh
 aisa sambhav hi nahin ki bina pradhanmantri kii anumati se 20 hajaar logon kii maut ke liye jimmedaar vyakti ko sarkari atithi banaaya jaae yaa bina mukhyamantri ke aadesh ke sarkari vimaan kaa upyog karne diya jaae
 The BJP spokesperson said that Anderson would not have gone alone in the plane
 sarkaar spasht kare ki anderson ke saath vimaan main koun vyakti tha
 He said that the government should show political will for Anderson's extradition and Congress should apologize to the people of the country for cheating the victims in the tragedy

 a post shared by Swara Bhasker (@reallyswara) on Mar 18, 2018 at 2:13 pm PDTA post shared by Swara Bhasker (@reallyswara) on Apr 26, 2018 at 9:23 am PDT zyada to nahin lekin kam se kam 10 saal ke itihaas ke bare main itnaa kah saktaa hum ki jab bhi kisi bhale maanush ne sansad kii darshak ddeergha kaa paas banavaane kaa aagrah kiya, maine hila-hawali kar taal di
 The only reason for this was that there was never any confidence that on the day the person would come from a far corner of the country, the house would not be adjourned
 sthagit hona sansad kaa dharm ban gaya haimaje kii baat yah he ki sansad jis bhi mudde par kisi satr main sthagit hoti he, jaruri nahin ki agle satr main vah mudda kisi ko yaad bhi rah jaae
 From the coffin scam to the indo-us nuclear deal, you will see this monotony in the demand for the resignation of BJP ministers
 taaja maamle main dekhie ki pichhali baar jameen kanoon par bavaal tha, lekin is baar uskaa shor dab gaya he
 That is, our mps have decided to disrupt Parliament by rising above the party spirit
 agar yah atikathan lagata he to aap nijee taur par kisi bhi party ke saansad se poochkar dekh lijie, vahasansad satrake dauraan apane kuch vaikalpik kaarykram aapako bataa degaa
 So the question is why? However, there can be many big and important reasons for this
 lekin akasar bisar die jane vaala kaaran yahaan ginane kaa man he
 That is, mps are confident that they will get coverage if they create ruckus on the road, outside Parliament and in the House
 or agar wo shantipurvak sadan main apni baat rakhenge to unki baat media ke jariye thasak ke saath janata main nahin jaaegi
 At the same time, if they tear up the paper in the House, go near the Speaker's seat, or do any visible act which is dear to the camera, then they will come into the discussion
 saansad apane ant:karan main yah bhi khub jaanate hai ki sadan ke baahar media ke camaron ke saamne uchhaale gaye unke jumale bhi khub khabar banaate hai
 That is, mps want to give exciting visual media instead of dialogue, for which the cameras thirst
 vaise bhi aam aadmi kai baar is baat ko bhul jaataa he ki jabasansad nahin chalati, tab bhi sadan ke patal par likhit prashnon kaa jawaab to sambandhit mantri de hi rahaa hota he
 It is also not that these questions are of less importance, but they are not heard in TV media on the same day
 haa, bhuule-bhatke koi akhbaar yaa samachar agency inamen se kisi ko khabar bana de, to agle din electronic media kii najare inayat ho jaati he
 So if it happens that the public representatives are somehow convinced that the dialogue can get the same prominence in the news, apart from the controversy, then maybe the mps will not only get into debating but also competing to debit them Come on
 lokapal ke mudde par anna ke anshan ke dauraan sadan main behtareen samvaad hua tha, to isaki ek vahaj yah bhi thi ki netaaon ko pataa tha, ki jo wo bolne ja rahe hai, vah camere kii ankhon se puraa desh dekhegaa
 Will the camera assure the Parliament that it is really ready to show the proceedings of the House? At the moment its scope is not visible, because doing so does not match the basic characteristics of journalism
 bhartiya raajnneeti main buudhvaar ko congress kii ore se 'most awated' political entry ho gai
 Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has entered active politics just before the Lok Sabha Polls and now she has been made the General Secretary of the Congress
 priyanka gandhi kaa sakriy raajnneeti main aane ke faisle par muhar pichley saptaah us vakt lagi, jab congress adhyaksh or unke bhai rahul gandhi kii mulaakaat unsamerica main hui thi
 If seen in this way, the script of Priyanka Gandhi's entry into politics was written in America and at the same time this decision was approved under the direction of Rahul Gandhi
 darasal, rahul gandhi dubai se sidhe america ek vishesh mishan par gaye the
 That mission was to persuade Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to enter active politics and to tell that now is the right time for her political entry
 ab tak priyanka gandhi kaa raajnneeti main puri tarah interest nahin tha
 Because earlier she has been attending road shows and rallies in Amethi and Rae Bareli for her brother Rahul and mother Sonia during elections
 congress ke ahm sutron ne enditivi se bataaya ki pichley do saalon ke dauraan hi priyanka gandhi wadra ne raajnneeti main aane kaa faisla kiya tha, magar isaki koi samay-seemaa nahin thi ki vah kab raajnneeti main utrengi
 Preoccupied with her children, Priyanka Gandhi kept her plan open that she would execute her decision when needed
 magar jab jab uttar pradesh main mayawati or akhilesh yadav kii party basapa-sapa ke saath gathbandhan kii sambhaavnaaen samaapt ho gayi, tab jaakar rahul gandhi ne faisla kiya ki ab priyanka gandhi vaala par daanv chalane kaa samay aa gaya he
 This is the reason why Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met in the United States and announced their visit to Amethi there
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki priyanka gandhi wadra farvari ke pehle saptaah main waapas aa jaaengi
 An important Congress leader said that if there was an alliance with Mayawati and Akhilesh in UP, then perhaps Priyanka Gandhi's entry would not have happened yet or her political entry would have been in a different format and in different timings
 magar, ab congress upi kii sabhi 80 siton par chunaav ladanaa chaahati he or use aisi ummid ho gai he ki vah kam se kam unamem se 30 siton par jeet darj kar sakati he
 Before this big announcement, the Congress was projected to win ten seats
 party ke sutara ne yah baat kahi
 After Priyanka Gandhi's entry into politics, now three people have come from the Gandhi family in the Congress Working Committee
 rahul gandhi, sonia gandhi or ab priyanka gandhi
 However, it is not yet confirmed where Priyanka Gandhi will contest from
 magar sutron kii maane to priyanka gandhi apni maa kii paramparaagat seat raibareli se chunaav lard sakati hai
 Let me tell you that earlier there were such discussions that Sonia Gandhi Party could avoid politics
 party ke andar ke logon kaa kahana he ki priyanka gandhi or jyotiraditya sindhiya kii team main 90 fisadi candidet 50 saal se kam umr ke honge or unamem se aadhe ummidavaar 40 saal se kam ke honge
 This time the Congress will appear in a different color form in Uttar Pradesh
 congress party upi main har jagah par apni majboot upasthiti darj karana chaahati he
 This is the reason why Congress is still running with this objective that it has to make its party strong there
 congress ke bheetar ke logon ne kaha ki priyanka gandhi kii raajnneeti main entry or purvi upi kii kaman sanbhaalane ke baad brahman votaron par prabhaav daalega
 With his entry, votes of Brahmins will be towards Congress
 bataa den ki upi main 12 fisadi brahman vot hai
 However, one thing is certain now that Priyanka Gandhi's entry has raised an expectation in the Congress party and she has started feeling that she is now in the battle of UP
 bijepi netaa or kendriya mantri babul supriyo ke saath guuruuvaar ko trinmul congress ke sadasyon ne kathith rup se dhakkamukki kii, jab vah apane abhibhavakon ke saath yahaan ek matdaan centre par matdaan karne pahunche the
 No arrests have been made in connection with this incident
 kolkata police maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 When Babul reached the Arya Kanya Mahavidyalaya in Shobhabazar area with his parents to vote, a huge crowd gathered
 kendriya shahari vikaas rajya mantri ko kathith trinmul kaaryakartaaon ke virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Trinamool members shouted 'go back, go back' against them to attract the crowd
 iske baad unke bich kahasuni hui
 Some protesters alleged that Babylon was not a voter of that constituency and was 'poisoning the atmosphere'
 babul ne kaha, 'main yahaan ek aam aadmi ke rup main matdaan karne ke liye aayaa tha, na ki mantri ke rup main
 i was not accompanied by any security personnel, nor any BJP worker
 lekin in logon ne aisi cheez par virodh shuru kar diya jisaki koi jarurat nahin thi
 He also alleged that no policemen were present at the polling station
 tippaniyan Babylon caught a worker who had allegedly abused him when he was coming out of the booth after voting
 kolkata police ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha, jab babul supriyo matdaan karne ke liye yahaan pahunche, kuch logon ne pradarshan kiya

 matdaan karne ke liye jab babul apane abhibhavakon ke saath shobhabazar ilaake main sthit arya kanya mahavidhyalay pahunche, vahaan baari bheed ekatra ho gai
 The Union Minister of State for Urban Development faced opposition from alleged Trinamool activists
 trinmul sadasyon ne bheed ko aakarshith karne ke liye unke khilaaf 'waapas jaao, waapas jaao' kii narebaaji kii
 After this there was an argument between them
 kuch pradarshnakariyon ne aarope lagaaya ki babul us nirvachan kshetra ke matadaata nahin hai or 'maahaul ko vishakt' kar rahe the
 Babul said, 'I came here to vote as a common man and not as a minister
 mere saath koi surakshakarmi nahin tha, na hi koi bijepi kaaryakarta
 But these people started protesting on something which was not needed
 ' unhone yah aarope bhi lagaaya ki matdaan centre par koi pulicekarmi maujuud nahin tha
 The comments babul ne ek kaaryakarta ko pakad liya, jisane kathith taur par unke saath us samay galigalouj kii thi, jab vah matdaan karne ke baad booth se baahar aa rahe the
 a senior Kolkata Police official said, when Babul Supriyo arrived here to vote, some people demonstrated
 hamane suna he ki kuch logon ne unhen dhakka bhi diya

 In Chhattisgarh, the CD is proving to be not only a political tactic but also an effective weapon to give a befitting reply to your enemy
 ye or baat he ki yahaan ke rajaneta ise darty politics kehete hai
 Whether it is BJP or Congress, both parties released their cds and attacked their enemies
 chhattisgarh main rajya ke PWD mantri rajesh munat kii kathith darty sidi ne raman singh sarkaar saakh daav par laga di he
 These cds came at a time when the election enthusiasts in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh were fast
 donon hi rajyon main bijepi janata ke prati khud ko jimmedaar sabit karte hue apni chaal cheharaa or charitra ko chamakaane main juty he
 At such a time, the alleged obscene CD of a senior minister in the bjp-ruled state of Chhattisgarh has upset the party
 isse pehle kii issidiki kaalikh sarkaar kii chhavi par badnuma daag ban jaae usase pehle maamle ko sibiai ko saunp diya gaya
 Chief Minister Raman Singh said that the declining level of state politics has made him think
 is sidi ne sirf bijepi hi nahin balki puure rajnatik galiyare main aisi khalabali machaa di he ki sirf rajaneta hi nahin police or aam janata bhi is baat ko jaanane ke liye baichaiyn hai ki sidi kahaan bani, kisne banaai or kis makasad se bani
 Character has become the source of murder, according to the Chief Minister of the state, Raman Singh, CD has made politics disgusting
 unka kahana he ki bazaar main aae din kabhi kisi naukarshah to kabhi kisi rajaneta kii sidi kii charchaa rahati he
 But legally, this is rarely confirmed
 haal hi main darty sidi ko lekar ghire rajya ke PWD ministar rajesh munat kaa kahana he ki sidi ab charitra htya kaa jariya ban gai he
 In the political conspiracy, it is a weapon that can mix anyone's image in the mud
 haalanki wo us sidi kii hakeekat ko lekar jaddojahad kar rahe hai, jisane puure pradesh main khalabali machaai hui he
 CD encouraged blackmailing in politics, while Congress state president Bhupesh Baghel argues that in many cases, CD has opened the reality of the ruling party
 unke mutabik rajnatik va prashasnic dabaav kaa istemaal bijepi 2003 se karti chali aa rahi he
 Due to this, people see the CD effective to reveal its reality
 unka kahana he ki yadi koi bhi sattadhari dal kanoon ke mutabik kaam kare to kisi ko sidi banane kii aavashyaktaa naa pade
 At the same time, journalist Gopal Das, who examines cybercrime and cds and keeps a check on the crimes committed by it, says that everything has become valid in the current era of politics
 jabase raajnneeti kaa apradheekaran hua he, tab se to kendriya raajnneeti ho yaa phir pradeshik har jagah is baat kaa khatra hota he ki kahin koi kufia camere se aapaki gatividhiyaan hi nahin balki aapaki baatcheet ko record to nahin kar rahaa
 According to him, CD has given a big boost to blackmailing in politics
 rajya main aadha darjan se zyada bade sidi cond hue hai
 It has got wrapped up from the central government to the state government
 1-pehla sidi cond us samay surkhiyon main aayaa jab 2003 main tatkaaleen mukhyamatri ajit jogi ke kaarykaal main NCP leader ramavatar jaggi kii kisi agyaat shaks ne goli markar hatya kar di thi
 Three consecutive cds came in this case
 is sidi ke jariye sibiai hatyaron tak pahunchi
 Amit Jogi, the son of the then Chief Minister Ajit Jogi, also had to face the wind of jail due to several incidents in this case
 haalanki baad main vah adaalat se bari ho gaye
 But a total of 31 accused were convicted due to clues obtained through cds
 2-varsh 2003 ke aakhri maah main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari bajpeyi ke mantri mandal ke sadsy kendriya mantri dilip singh judev ko rishwat dene kaa maamla saamne aayaa
 In this CD, Dilip Singh Judeo was accepting the amount of bribe, saying that 'money is not God but not less than that'
 isi saal rajya main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne bhi ek sidi jari kii
 In that CD, he threw water on the wishes of the outgoing Chief Minister Ajit Jogi and revealed the temptation and buying horse he was giving to BJP mlas

 isse bijepi pratyaashee ko chunauti nahin mili or ve ek tarafa jeet gaye
 a few days after the election was over, the Congress released a CD
 jisamen dikhaaya gaya ki kis tarah se bijepi ke netaaon ne congress pratyaashee manturam ke saath naam vaapasi kaa sauda kiya tha
 The full reference to the purchase of Congress candidate was recorded in this CD

 He was also offering to make that man an officer in the Congress Committee in lieu of this CD
 kul milakar chhattisgarh main sidi rajnatik hathiyaar ke rup main badi kargar najar aa rahi he
 The politics of CD in Chhattisgarh has made relations between politicians and common people uncomfortable
 afasar apane adhinst karmchaariyon se to rajaneta apane kaaryakartaaon se baatcheet or mail milaap karne ko lekar bhi kataraate hai
 He was afraid that his CD was not being made through some intelligence cameras

 Whether the issue is of dirty picture or bribery
 sibiai maamle kii gaharaai tak jaati he
 Despite this, in any case so far, the person present on the CD has been officially identified
 iskaa kaaran he ki viral hui sidi kii mul prati kabhi bhi jaanch agenciyon ke haath nahin lagi
 As a result, the CD is not proven in Forensic Laboratory and the investigation proves to be three parts of Dhaka
 loksabhaa chunaav (lok Sabha Election) ke maddenjar uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party (samajwadi Party) or bahujan samaajaparty (bahujan Samaj Party) ke bich hue gathbandhan ke baad raajnneeti tej ho gai he
 After this alliance came to the fore, senior leader Shivpal Yadav, who was separated from the Samajwaji Party, expressed his desire to form a new alliance with the Congress in the state
 unhone kaha he ki agar congress chaahe to vah unke saath gathbandhan ke liye taiyaar hai
 He said on Sunday that we are fully prepared for the Congress
 bataa den ki shivpal yadav (shivpal Yadav)ne pichley saal samaajawaadee party (samajwadi Party) se alag apni ek alag party banaai thi
 At the same time, after coming out of the SP-BSP alliance, Congress President Rahul Gandhi said in his response that i respect Mayawati ji and Akhilesh Yadav
 gathbandhan ko lekar unhone jo faisla liya he main usapar kuch nahin bolnaa chahta lekin itnaa jaruri he ki hamaari party upi main puri takat ke saath loksabhaa chunaav main utregi
 Significantly, on Saturday, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and BSP chief Mayawati announced the SP-BSP alliance in a joint press conference
 unhone is gathbandhan se congress ko baahar rakhaa tha
 Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav announced in a joint press conference that the SP and BSP will contest 38-38 seats in the Lok Sabha elections
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne chaar siten chhod di hai, jisamen do siten sahyogiyon ke khate main jaaegi vahiin, do siten congress ke liye chhod di gai hai, amethi or raibareli he
 Mayawati fiercely attacked both BJP and Congress during a shared press conference
 unhonesapa-basapa gathbandhan par kaha tha ki is gathbandhan se piem modi or amit shah kii neend ud jaaegi
 Mayawati had said that there is an undeclared emergency in bjp's rule today
 bijepi ko is baar congress ko hui 1977 main hue chunaav kii tarah hi bada nuksaan hone vaala he
 The SP-BSP is not going to benefit much from going with the Congress
 hamanen apane anubhav ko hi tarjeeh di he
 With the Congress joining, our vote share has a bad effect
 agar ham inke saath nahin jate hai to hamaare paas vot kaa share zyada rahata he
 So we have kept the Congress out of the coalition for this reason
 haalanki hamaari party ne yah faisla liya he ki puure desh main congress party yaa is tarah kii kisi bhi anya party se gathbandhan karke chunaav nahin ladegi jisase hamaara vot hi cat jaae
 Mayawati had said that Congress government had gone because of Bofors, now BJP government will go because of Rafale
 rafel bijepi ko le duubegi
 Mayawati had said that BJP has gained power in the state by dishonesty
 hamane gathbandhan main congress ko nahin rakhaa
 Whether Congress or BJP came, both have the same thing
 congress or bijepi kii nitiyaan ek jaisi he
 The condition of both governments has been the same
 agar ham congress se gathbandhan karte hai to hamen ghaataa hoga
 Because corruption happened during the Congress time also
 mayawati ne kaha tha ki upi main bijepi ne beimaani se sarkaar banaai he
 Will prevent anti-people from coming to power
 bijepi kii ahamkaari sarkaar se log pareshaan he
 Just like we have defeated the BJP in the by-elections, similarly we will defeat the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections
 kyonki aam aadmi party ke vaade ke mutabik chaar maheene yani 120 din main dilli ke logon ke liye bijli ke rate aadhe hone hai, isliye har ek din keemtee he
 Why the delay of even one day in being such an important thing? Because within four months, the new government of AAP is going to forgive all illegitimate water bills, so Delhiites are waiting every single day
 janata iske liye ek din bhi zyada intjaar kyon kare?kyonki 100 din ke andar dilli main un logon ko muft water supplai shuru honi he jo har maheene 700 litre yaa kam pani kharch karte hai, isliye dilli vaasiyon ke liye har din keemtee he
 Because within 100 days that Special Security Force is to be formed, which will ensure the safety of every woman of Delhi
 kyonki dilli main mahangaai khatm honi he, kyonki dilli main har temprari karmchaaree ko permanent hona he, kyonki dilli main swaraj aana he, bhrashtachar khatm hona he, kyonki har mahila ko surakshit jivan chahie, dalit udhyamiyon ko jiro interest par lone paanaa he, galat cese main band musalamaanon ko nyaay paanaa he or yah sab abhi chahie or isi ke liye janata ne aapako vot diya he, to phir iske liye janata se poochne kaa khel kyon?congress aapaki sarkaar gira degi, aapako kaam nahin karne degi, yah ho saktaa he
 This is entirely possible given the past of the Congress
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jab aap karrwai karenge to ho saktaa he ki congress aapaki sarkaar se samarthan waapas le le
 But until this happens? Till then why don't you run the government? If you make water and electricity cheaper, will the Congress oppose you? Let it be done
 yah aapke prachand bahumat se sarkaar main waapas aane kaa rasta hoga
 If the Congress is willing to commit suicide, let it do so
 is baat se mat darie ki aapke vidhayakon ko tab tak satta kii aadat ho jaaegi
 They are the 'honest' people of the 'honest' party
 laalach jaisaa shabd unke liye nahin he
 There is no need to ask the public for everything
 janata ne aapako khandit hi sahi, lekin janadesh de diya he
 Has stated his opinion
 ab agar aap galat karenge to janata aapako agle chunaav main nipta degi or acha karenge to aap ko shahon kaa shah bana degi
 This is how Indian democracy works

 The floods in Kerala have been called the worst floods of the century, but the CAG report released last year had predicted such a flood
 yadi is report ko gambhirtha se liya gaya to baadh se hue nuksaan ko bahut had tak kam kiya ja saktaa tha
 Environmentalist Vikrant Tongad says that flood management is in a bad condition in the country
 baadh kaa prakope zyada hoga to nuksaan zyada hoga, masalan raahat or punarvaas ke liye zyada muaavja bantega
 Vikrant says that the scandals of the officials regarding relief and rehabilitation compensation are involved in the strategy of keeping the disaster situations as it is
 kerala main baadh ke liye koi ek factor jimmedaar nahin he
 Many factors are involved in this flood orgy
 vikrant tongad ne ieenes se baatcheet main kaha, "lagbhag ek dashak se jalwaayu parivartan se hone vaale nuksaan ko lekar aagaah kiya ja rahaa he
 Of course, climate change has a huge hand in the macabre form of flood, but at the same time domestic factors and government policies are equally responsible
 baadh ko roka nahin ja saktaa lekin isse hone vaale nuksaan ko bahut had tak kam kiya ja saktaa he
 The green area is decreasing, causing uncontrolled rains
 " unhone pichley saal jari kaig kii report kaa hawala dete hue ieenes ko bataaya, "hamaara aapadaa prabandhan durust nahin he
 The CAG report, released last year, said that it has been more than 70 years since we were liberated, but so far the money allocated for the flood is not being utilized properly
 hamaari baadh prabandhan evam punarvaas yojana purna rup se kriyanvit nahin ho rahi he
 For this, crores of rupees allocated are being spent on the visits of officers and their facilities
 is report par bada ghamaasan machaa tha or kaha gaya tha ki is tarah chalata rahaa to yah badi traasadee ko janm degaa
 "on the magnitude of the floods in Kerala, he says," We are not ready to stop the floods and there was absolutely no preparation in Kerala

 "vikrant said," Kerala has received more than normal rainfall this time, which is more than in many years
 yahi vajah rahi ki idukki baandh ke paanchon dwaar kholane pade lekin isse pehle koi maathapai nahin kii gai ki 26 varsho main pehali baar baandh ke paanchon dwaar kholane par sthiti kya ho sakati he or jo sthiti hui, vah sabake saamne hai
 "he says," If the CAG report was implemented seriously, the damage caused by the floods in Kerala could have been reduced to a great extent
 jan evam dhan haani kam ho sakati thi
 If the policy on paper was thriving, we would have saved a lot of lives if it had been properly implemented in reality

 If the outbreak of flood is more, then the loss will be more, for example more compensation will be distributed for relief and rehabilitation
 adhikari isi main khush hai
 "on this corruption, he says," It is not just financial corruption, it is practical corruption but it is also not only that these scams increase the risk of floods
 baadh prabandhan main routine bhrashtachar he, jo desh main har jagah he
 You will also see this in Modi ji's Swasth Bharat Abhiyan

 When Narendra Modi stepped into the temple of democracy for the first time with the slogan of 'achhe Din', he bowed down to the frame of Parliament
 loktantr yani janata kii, janata ke liye or janata ke dwaara
 But interestingly, from the silence on tainters to the porn ban, the Modi government is now seen moving forward by defying the voice of the same people
 modi sarkaar ne jis tarah janata kii aawaaj se lekar court kii tippanee ko ansunakardesh main 857 porn websitsco bain karne ke aadesh die hai, sawaal uthne lage hai ki kya sarkaar aage bhi aise hi farmaan jari karti rahegi? sarkaar kaa tark he ki porn se samaaj main galat sandesh jaataa he
 If this is the case, then before porn, there are many things that need to be banned in our society, from temples to caves and squares
 ek najar un 08 chizon par jin par sarkaar ko bain lagane kii jarurat he # porn_bain:1) khujraho kaa mandilgar porn cites itane hi bure hai to khujraho main pattharon par ukere gaye premarupi murtiyon se samaaj ko jane vaale sandesh ke bare main pradhanmantri kya raay rakhte hai
 2) If the Indian society really needs to be frightened by the depiction of sexual intercourse between men and women in the Kamasutraporn sites of Vatsyayan, what is the government's opinion on the great creation Kamasutra created centuries ago
 tab chitra sambhav tha toklakaar kii kuchiyone unpar bhi jaadu bikheraa tha
 3) The pulp literature sold all over the country, pulp literature is sold at every street square
 kahin khulkar to kahin chhipakar
 From Mastram to all such litterateurs, it is not a matter of discussion
 aise main agar porn dekhne se man main galat khayalaat jagate hai to in saahitiyon ko padhakar mantrocchar to nahin hi hota hoga
 4) All the English entertainment and movies channels like the government is advocating Indian civilization and it is being threatened by every single thing, so all those English entertainment and TV channels in the country need to be panned
 kyonki 24 ghante ke darmyaan un par aise kai drishy dikhaae jate hai, jo 'bhartiya samskruti' ke liye khatra hai
 5) Monitoring should be done on cartoon channels as well
 The government also needs to monitor or close the cartoon channels broadcast to children
 kyonki un par bhi gaahe-bagaahe dwiarthi samvaad or aise vishyon par charchaa or prem main lipt jodon ko dikhaaya jaataa he
 6) If we are talking about girls jeans, mini skirt and deep neck top, then first of all there is a need to ban girls jeans, mini skirts, deep neck tops, off shoulder tops and any such garment, which has zippers
 Feel tired kyonki jab mobile or tivi kii screen 'galat khyal paidaa' kar sakati he to ye to saakshaat darshan hai
 7) Boys body darshan and boxers should also be banned along with girls, body darshan of boys and wearing boxers openly
 salmaan khan kaa kariyar isi ke boote chadha, lihaaja un par bhi bain laganaa chahie
 8) Talporn located immediately on parks and hills is bad
 pashchimi sabhyataa bhartiya samskruti ke sir maathe baithi he
 The news comes in the day, love is flourishing in the park of the city and the ridge of the hills
 kuch maukon par bajrang dal, viechpi jaise dal is par bhi roak kii maang karte rahe hai
 Hence their demand should also be accepted
 porn par bain kaa yah mudda aise samay bhi saamne aayaa he, jab sarkaar khud skulon main sex ajukeshan ko anivaary banane par charchaa kar rahi he
 Whereas in Indian society till now in the name of sex education and as a known teacher, porn websites and some similar magazines have been playing a role
 modi sarkaar jis nae daur main bhartiya samaaj ko lekar nae sire se paribhaasha gadhane kii taiyaari main he, usee samaaj ke navgathit dhaanche soshal media ne sarkaar ke is faisle par kadi aapatti jataai he
 Away from debate and discussion, the Government's decision is being rejected outright, but the government's last and first compulsion in 'democracy' to withstand the mandate is, or is, gone

 yema kaa naam ginis book of world records main sabase lambii aayu vaali jivit mahila ke taur par darj he
 Ema lives in the northern city of Verbania
 yema ne isi hafte 117 saal puure kiye hai
 Emma says she has fans all over the world and prays to God for her to live long
 duniya kii 100 prabhaavshaalee mahilaon main 105 saal kii saalumrada bhi
 
 
 You will be surprised to know that Emma explains the secret of her long life, the consumption of eggs and cookies every day
 ve kahati hen ki unhone apane jivan main kaaphi kam fal-subjiyan khai hai
 Emma was anemic for a long time, when she was declared anemic by doctors at the age of 20
 tab se yema ne pratidin andey khaane aarambh kiye
 Even today they consume 2 eggs per day
 ab ve biscuit kaa adhik seven karti hai
 There is no one left in the family, Emma is the eldest of eight siblings
 ab keval ve hi jivit hai

 uske kuch samay baad hi unka iklauta betaa bhi mar gaya or ve duniya main akeli rah gayi

 ve zyada der tivi bhi nahin dekh paatin
 She spends her time either sleeping or eating something
 ye he duniya kaa sabase chota kapal, ginis book main naam darj

 But his simple lifestyle is the real reason for his longevity
 lambey samay se unki dekhbhaal kar rahe doctor bawa kehete hai, 've kabhi aspataal nahin janaa chaahatin
 He has never made any specific plans to take care of his health
 jo bhi ho wo positive rahane main yakeen rakhti hai

 During this time, the Supreme Court argued on behalf of the Muslim side
 jab adaalat main jafarayab jilani apana paksh rakh rahe the, to supreme court ne unase vivaadit sthaan par namaaj padhe jane ke saboot maange
 On which, on behalf of Jilani it was stated that they have no written evidence
 darasal, muslim paksh kii ore se mangalvaar ko rajeev dhawan ne supreme court main apni daleel puri kii
 After which the debate was pushed forward by Zafaryab Jilani
 isi dauraan jafarayab jilani ne kaha ki ayodhya main janmasthal par ramajanm ko lekar vishwaas to he, lekin hindu paksh ke paas saboot koi nahin he
 Jilani said that in the arguments so far, Ramcharit Manas, Valmiki Ramayana has been mentioned
 lekin yachikakartaon ko sabit karnaa hoga ki ramajnmasthan kii baat kin granthon main kii gai he
 Because there is no mention of birthplace in the Ramcharit Manas, Valmiki Ramayana
 unhone kaha ki 1949 se pehle madhya gumbad ke neeche ramajanm, puja kaa koi astitv yaa saboot nahin miltaa he
 Ayodhya case: SC asked- do you consider Ramchabutare as birthplace? Jilani said - On Yesi, Justice Bobde asked Zafaryab Jilani if you would give evidence that there was regular prayer before 1949? 
 isapar justise ashok bhushan ne kaha ki hindu paksh kii daleel main bhi ramayana, ramcharita maanas main ayodhya main dasharath mahal main ram ke janm kaa zikr he haalanki sthaan kaa koi zikr nahin he
 a witness also said that in the Kavitavali and other texts, there is mention of Ramjan Ayodhya or Avadhpuri or Saket but not the specific birthplace
 gavaah bhi vashishtha kunda, lomash kunda , vidhneshwar ganesh or pindarak se vivaadit sthal kii duuri or disha ke bare main kuch nahin bataa paae
 No specific place was also mentioned in Valmiki Ramayana
 jilani ne kaha ki ramcharita maanas kii rachana masjid banane ke kareeb 70 saal baad hui lekin kahin ye zikr nahin ki ram janmasthan vahaan he, jahaan masjid he
 That is, the belief of Hindus about birthplace also changed later
 is par justise bobade ne kaha ki babar ne mandir todakar masjid banaai yaa pehle kabhi mandir tha us jagah masjid banaai yaa khaali jagah par masjid bansi? is sawaal par jilani bole ki babar ne khaali plot par masjid banaai thi
 If there had been a temple before, then Babar would not have known this
 jilani ne kaha ki 1855 se pehle yahaan koi vivaad nahin tha
 The importance of the place increased since the shoot was shot
 is par justise bobade ne kaha ki kitni masjidon ko mir baaki ne banwaaya? jawaab main jilani ne kaha ki aaine akabari ke mutabik ilaake suubon main bante hote the or masjidon kaa nirmaan soobedaar karaate the
 Jilani said that the mirror details the establishment of the entire empire in Akbari
 yahi ek aisi kitaab he, jisamen mughal shasankaal ke dauraan harek baariki kaa zikr he
 Justice Bobde said that if the mirror Akbari has all the details then why is there no mention of the mosque
 jawaab main jilani ne kaha ki ye badshaah ne nahin commander ne banavaai thi
 There was no temple at the place which is claimed to have been demolished
 jab aaine akabari main kaashi main mandir todane kaa zikr he to ayodhya ke mandir todane kaa bhi zikr hota
 In Jilani ain-e-akbari, there is no mention of Ramjanmabhoomi, but the holy city of Awadh where Hindus worship Rama
 justise bhushan ne jilani ko tokaa ki skandapurana kaa hawala to aapke gavaah ne bhi diya he jisamen usne ram janmasthan kii baat kahi he

 Today is International Labor Day
 lagbhag 80 deshon main yah diwas 1 may ko manaaya jaataa he, jo bhi is duniya main kisi bhi rup main kaam kar rahaa he wo ek majdoor hi he
 What someone has written a lot: - 'it carries the burden of stone on the heart for years
 pesha koi bhi ho, ghar se dur jaakar kamaane vaala majdoor hi hota he
 
 
 In the country that is running today, it is the contribution of the same workers who work hard day and night
 is duniya ko banane or chalaane main ahm yogadan dene vaale mazdooron ko ham salaam karte hai

 They said that the work time is more, which affects their health
 us samay mazdooron kii hadtaal kaa america par zyada fark nahin padaa lekin kuch samay baad america main 8 ghante kaam karne kaa samay tay kar diya gaya
 Today, many countries including India have a law to work for 8 hours
 bharat main majdoor diwas kaa elaanbhale hi 1886 main majdoor diwas lagu ho gaya tha
 But it started in India on 1 May 1923 in Chennai where it was celebrated for the first time

 guru nanak dev ji nekam karnaa, naam japana,kaa sandesh diya
 He used to say that Bapu used to say that the progress of any country depends on the workers and farmers of that country
 bina unke desh kaa vikaas sambhav nahin hai
 Baba Saheb Ambedkar got the laborers under control
 He said that thousands of kings have been made today by enslaving the Indians
 lekin aaj bhi un tamaam mazdooron ke baaren main nahin sochaa jaataa ki vah kin kathinaaiyon se guzar rahaa he
 It is Ambedkar who implemented the act in favor of the workers, in which the employees state insurance (ESI), medical care to workers, medical leave (leave when sick), providing various facilities for the physically disabled during work Provided indemnity insurance to

 aaj ham jo aaraam se baithkar kaam kar rahe he unke peeche un mazdooron kii kadi he jo din-raat lage rahete he
 No matter how big you and we achieve, but it would not be wrong to say that behind our success is the hand of a laborer who works for us
