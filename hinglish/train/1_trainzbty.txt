 bhartiya team se baahar chal rahe salaami ballebaaj gautam gambhir nahin maanate ki spot phixing or sattebaaji ke kaaran ipel kii chhavi kharaab hui he
 He said that the image of the entire game does not deteriorate due to some wrong people
 kolkata niterides ke bhi captain gambhir ne kaha, kuchhek log jinhone kuch galat kiya he ve puure khel kii chhavi pesh nahin karte
 Even today, there are crores of people who want to come on the field and represent the country
 gambhir ke liye ipel mahatvapurn toornament he, lekin unhen lagata he ki chiyarliders par pratibandh lagaana pratiyogita se bhrashtachar ko mitaane kaa samaadhaan nahin he
 He told 'NDTV', i think it depends on the person
 aap kisi vyakti ko galat kaam karne se nahin roak sakate
 The IPL is an important tournament
 jab main keker se judaa to maine keval maidan par acha pradarshan karne par dhyaan diya
 Gambhir said, but if some people believe that the IPL is more for off-field activities, then they are taking the IPL the wrong way
 kuch log hi aisa sochate hai or aap un par niyantran nahin kar sakate
 The best way is not to make them part of the IPL
 gambhir haal main lachar pradarshan ke kaaran bhartiya team se baahar chal rahe hai
 His name was also not considered for the ongoing Champions Trophy in England
 tippaniyan Gambhir was asked how the opening pair of Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma are doing well in the Champions Trophy, so how difficult it would be for them to make a comeback, he said, no matter how difficult it is for any player to return
 uskaa ran bananaa mahatvapurn hota he, kyonki ballebaaj hone ke kaaran aap isiilie cricket khelte ho or isse aapako adhik khushi milti he
 Gambhir refused to accept Manoj Tiwari's assertion that 2012 champions Kolkata Knight Riders could not perform well in the IPL this time because the team lacked mutual harmony
 unhone kaha, mujhe nahin pataa ki manoj tiwari ne kya kaha
 This is his personal view, but if you do not play good cricket then you have to listen to it
 jab aap team ke rup main nahin khelte ho to aisa hoga
 Captain Gambhir of Kolkata Knight Riders also said, "some people who have done something wrong do not portray the image of the whole game
" ab bhi karodon log aise hai, jo maidan par utarkar desh kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa chaahate hai
 IPL is an important tournament for Gambhir, but he feels that banning cheerleaders is not the solution to eradicate corruption from the competition
 unhone ‘enditivi’ se kaha, mere hisaab se yah vyakti par nirbhar karata he
 You cannot stop a person from doing wrong things
 ipel mahatvapurn toornament he
 When i joined KKR, i only focused on doing well on the field
 gambhir ne kaha, lekin yadi kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki ipel maidan kii baahar kii gatividhiyon ke liye adhik he to ve ipel ko galat tareeke se le rahe hai
 Some people think like this and you cannot control them
 sabase badhiya tarika yahi he ki unhen ipel kaa hissaa nahin banaaya jaae
 Gambhir is out of the Indian team recently due to poor performance
 england main chal rahi champions trophy ke liye bhi unke naam par vichaar nahin kiya gaya
 The comments gambhir se poocha gaya ki champions trophy main shikhar dhawan or rohit sharma kii salaami jodi acha pradarshan kar rahi he, aise main unke liye vaapasi karnaa kitna mushkil hoga, unhone kaha, kisi bhi khilaadi ke liye yah myne nahin rakhata ki vaapasi kitni mushkil he
 His scoring is important because as a batsman you play cricket and this makes you more happy
 gambhir ne manoj tiwari kii is baat ko maanane se inkaar kar diya ki 2012 kaa champion kolkata niterides is baar ipel main isliye acha pradarshan nahin kar paaya kyonki team main aapasi sauhaard kii kami thi
 He said, i do not know what Manoj Tiwari said
 yah uskaa nijee vichaar he, lekin yadi aap acchhee cricket nahin khelte to aapako aisa sunanaa padataa he

 ugte surya ko arghya dene kii reeti to kai vraton or tyoharon main he lekin duubate surya ko arghya dene kii parampara aamtaur par keval chhath vrath main he
 Why arghya is offered to the sun on the shashthi of Kartik month Shukla Paksha
 aaie jaanate hai
 
 
 
 subah, dopaher or shaam teen samay surya dev vishesh rup se prabhavi hote hai
 Worshiping the sun in the morning improves health
 dopaher main surya kii aradhana se naam or yash badhata he
 The worship of the sun at dusk brings prosperity to life
 shaam ke samay surya apni duusari patni pratyusha ke saath rahete hai
 Therefore offering argya to Pratyusha gives immediate benefits
 jo duubate surya kii upasna karte hai ,wo ugte surya kii upasna bhi zarur karenjyotish ke jaankaron kii maane to ast hote surya ko arghya dene kii parampara insaani jindagi har tarah kii pareshaani dur karne kii shakti rakhti he
 Then the problem is related to health or personal life
 dhalate surya ko arghya dekar kai museebaton se chhutkaaraa paaya ja saktaa he
 These people must offer arghya to the setting sun - those who are caught in the trial without any reason
 jin logon kaa koi kaam sarkari vibhaag main atka ho
 People whose eyesight is decreasing

 china ne mangalvaar ko ummid jataai ki bricks desh shiyaman main samooh ke aagaamee shikhar sammelan kii safalataa ke liye mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaayenge
 Beijing's remarks come a day after India and China agreed to withdraw troops to end the Doklam standoff
 bharat or china ne beijing kii mejabani main hone ja rahe bricks brazil, rus, bharat, china or dakshin africa shikhar sammelan se kuch din pehle ek badi kootnithik safalataa ke tahat doklam se apane-apane sainikon ko hataakar 73 din se chale aa rahe gatirodh ko somvaar kii roj ko khatm kiya tha
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Xiamen to attend the summit from September 3 to 5
 yah puche jane par ki kya china ne gatirodh khatm karne ke liye doklam main sadak kaa kaam roak diya he jisase ki bricks shikhar sammelan yojit ho sake, chini videsh mantralay kii pravaktaa hua chuning ne kaha ki kootnithik madhyam se mudde kaa shantipurna samaadhaan sambandhit sabhi pakshon ke saajha hiton ko puraa karata he
 Hua said, this reflects China's well-being and its responsible attitude as a big country
 ise bhi padhe :- doklam se sena hataane kii prakriya shuruise bhi padhe :- doklam main 100 meter peeche hatane ko taiyaar chini sena, bharat 250 meter peeche bhejne par adshapani baat main aage unhone kaha ki shikhar sammelan sabhi bricks deshon kaa samaan dhyey he or isaki safalataa sunishchit karne se sabhi sambandhit pakshon ke hiton kii purti hogi
 The spokesman said, 'we hope that all concerned can play a role in the success of the summit
 ham sabhi sambandhit pakshon se samarthan evam samanvay kii ummid karte hai'
 When asked about road construction in Doklam, Hua said that China would consider all related factors including the weather while constructing it
 unhone bataaya ki seemaa raksha, jivan str main sudhaar jaisi aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne ke kram main china ne sadak nirmaan sahit avasanrachana vikaas main kaaphi kaam kiya hai
 Hua reiterated that Chinese troops would continue to stay and patrol the Doklam area
 ham aitihaasik sandhiyon ke saath apni samprabhutaa kii raksha ke liye kaam karnaa jari rakhenge
 However, she seems to have avoided the question whether China is in talks with Bhutan, which has protested against the road construction of Chinese troops in Doklam
 unhone kaha, 'ab tak hamane bhartiya sainikon kii avaidh ghuspaith ke mudde kaa samaadhaan kiya he'
 In his familiar style, US President Barack Obama has said in relation to the weapons culture and the devastating incidents of firing that 'the time has come to do something'

 Addressing a meeting in Minneapolis, Obama said, "we don't have to match" yes "to" yes "on everything
 ab kuch karne kaa samay aa gaya he
 This is my main message today and everyone from us has to play his role
 unhone ek saptaah pehle kaha tha ki unhone maamalon kii prishthbhumi kii padtaal karne, skulon ko yadi jarurat ho to unhen adhik adhikari muhaiyaa karaane or beemaari rokthaam centre ko hinsa ke kaarnon kaa pataa lagane ko kaha tha
 The comments obama ne tark diya , lekin ab samay aa gaya he ki congress ko is mudde par ek nirnay lenaa chahie
 The President said, we should take steps
 hamen sena kii style ke hathiyaaron par pratibandh lagaana chahie
 Congress needs to be divided on this, because weapons of war are not needed in our cities, schools
 minipolis main ek baithak ko sambodhit karte hue obama ne kaha, hamen har baat par 'haa' main 'haa' milaane kii jarurat nahin he
 Now it's time to do something
 aaj kaa meraa mukhya sandesh yahi he or ham se har kisi ko apni bhoomika adaa kerani he
 He said a week ago that he had asked to investigate the background of the cases, provide more authorities to the schools if needed and the disease prevention center to find out the reasons for the violence
 tippaniyan Obama argued, but the time has come that Congress should take a decision on this issue
 raashtrapati ne kaha, hamen kadam uthaane chahie
 We should ban army style weapons

 Yes, Deepika's boyfriend Ranveer Singh also went to spend quality time with his lady love in Corsica
 lekin janaab, maamla yaheen nahin thama
 According to a source, whenever Deepika was in front of the camera, Ranveer Singh used to sit on the monitor with Imtiaz Ali and cut off when the Imtiaz scene was over, before Ranveer would start making suggestions for his purpose
 padhein, barsilona main quality time bitaa rahe hai 'good frends' deepika padukon or ranviryahi nahin, ranvir har shot ke baad sabake saamne deepika kii tarif karte or phir ye bataate ki kaise us seen ko or sudhara ja saktaa tha
 It cannot be said now how Imtiaz would have felt, but it was clear from Deepika's body language that she had to face a lot of embarrassment
 padhein, jab der raat ranvir singh ke ghar pahunchi deepika padukopub koi nahin jaanata ki ranvir ne aisa pyaar main bhavuk hokar kiya yaa kisi insicurity ke chalate, par jo bhi ho- ye pyaar ke nakhre hai janaab jo jeena mushkil kar dete hai

 ek choti-si smil aapako logon ke bich alag pahchaan de sakati he
 Usually we are very uncomfortable about our presentation during the interview
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki intervyuu lene vaala sirf 7 second main aapako kaaphi had tak parakh letaa he
 You will be surprised to know that he discovers your personality through your body language and how to smile
 yani intervyuu main baatcheet ke dauraan bhi muskaraan jarur chahie

 jab aap kisi se milte hai to aapke bolne se bhi pehle aapaki smil saamne vaale par ek impresssont daalati he
 So always keep a natural smile on your face
 yah aapaki sakaaratmak soch ko bhi bataati he
 2
 aapaki hansi aapke aatmavishvaas kaa jaahir karti he
 For example, when you meet a person and the person sees you without any smile, then you will get negative feeling inside you
 isliye yah baat hameshaa yaad rakhen ki ek choti-si smil saamne vaale se aapako atech kar detii he
 3
 kaam ke dauraan galatiyon kaa hona behad laazmi he, is dauraan bhi aapaki smil bahut kargar sabit hoti he
 Because it is better to ignore the mistake after making a mistake, accept it in front of your boss with a small smile
 aisa karne se bos ko bhi lagata he ki aap galatiyon se bhaagane vaale shaks nahin balki uskaa saamana karne vaale hai
 4
 hansi-khushi kaa maahaul kise acha nahin lagata
 Often you will have seen in the office that people do not like to talk to those who just remain silent or have a strict attitude
 vahiin jo log muskuraate hue aapse milte hai, aap unase milanaa nahin bhoolatey
 Now it is up to you whether you want to be a rage or a favorite
 5
 The most important thing is that doctors also advise you to smile
 yah ghar se lekar offis kii tension ke dauraan jaadu kii tarah kaam karti hai
 6
 intervyuu ke dauraan apana ai contact banaae rakhana kabhi nahin bhoolen
 7
 apni smil ke saath apni aavaj kaa balance bhi banaaen rakhen
 If your voice becomes louder or slower during the interview, it shows the behavior of deviating from your target

 How big is this challenge can be estimated in Uttar Pradesh
 desh ke 3
 Out of 31 crore dark houses, 42 percent come from this state
 yani kareeb ek karod gharon ko abhi tak bijli naseeb nahin hui he
 It is a matter of regret that the Sonbhadra district is the center of thermal power
 yahaan 8 bade bijlighar hai or is jile se desh ke alag-alag hisson ko bijli milti he
 But you must be surprised that electrification in this district is just 27 percent
 pradhanmantri modi kii ore se hui 31 disambar 2018 tak har ghar main bijli pahunchaa dene kii samay seemaa ek badi chunauti he
 The NDTV team has tried to know the ground reality by visiting several villages
 sonbhadra ke hi kachan gaanv main 4 maheene pehle bijli ai he
 Mumtaz Hussain, 35, of the same village, immediately bought this freezer and opened a cold drink shop

 The government of 61-year-old Kadale, on the banks of the village, installed a completely new meter before Holi
 hafte bhar ke bheetar bijli dene kaa vaada bhi kiya lekin ab tak bijli nahin pahunchi he
 But his hopes remain
 pradhanmantri kii di gai samay seemaa ke andar sarkaar ko hardoi main 8 maheene main 2 lakh 40,000 gharon main bijli pahunchaani he
 That means in 1000 houses every day
 vahiin upi kii yogi sarkaar kaa kahana he ki wo 8 maheene main ek karod gharon ko roshan karne kii chunauti uthaane ko taiyaar he
 According to the government, it is providing free electricity connections in every district by setting up free electricity camps
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki zilaavaar bijli lagane ke kaam kii har rose nigaraanee ho rahi he
 But there is also a reality that there are 1 crore 31 lakh houses in UP where there is no electricity
 desh main bina bijli vaale jo 3
 There are 13 crore houses, 42 percent of them are from UP alone
 enditivi kii team ne kai gaanvon main jaakar jamini hakeekat jaanane ke kii koshish kii he

 The population here ranges from 800 to 900 people
 gaanv ke kinare 61 saal ke kadale ke ghar sarkaar ne holi se pehle bilkul nayaa meter muft main lagaaya
 He also promised to provide electricity within a week, but so far no electricity has been delivered
 lekin unki ummid bani hui he
 Within the given time limit of the Prime Minister, the government has to provide electricity to 2 lakh 40,000 homes in Hardoi in 8 months
 yani har rose 1000 gharon main
 At the same time, the Yogi government of UP says that it is ready to take up the challenge of illuminating one crore houses in 8 months
 sarkaar ke mutabik wo har zile main free bijli camp lagaakar nunatam charch vaale power conection de rahi he
 The government claims that the work of district power installation is being monitored everyday
 lekin ek hakeekat yah bhi he ki upi main 1 karod 31 lakh ghar hai jahaan bijli nahin pahunchi he

 bharat ke kai hisson main log kele ke pattey par khaanaa khate hai
 Eating banana leaves is part of their local tradition
 mehmaanon ko jahaan kele ke pattey ke sabase upree hisse main khaanaa parosa jaataa he vahiin ghar ke log khud nichle hisse main khaanaa rakhkar khate hai
 Sitting on the clean floor, everyone eats food without a fork or spoon
 chaaval, meet, sabji, kari, achaar, dahi sabakuch isi kele ke pattey par parosa jaataa he
 Although people who do not have the habit of serving and eating food on banana leaves may find it quite difficult, but this tradition, which has been going on for thousands of years, has its own beliefs
 isparampara ke phaayde vaaki chaunkaane vaale hai:1
 In terms of health, the plantain-based compound of Sekale leaves is filled with polyphenols
 polifeynolls natural antioxidents hote hai joki sharir main maujuud free-radicals or duusari bimariyon se suraksha pradaan karne kaa kaam karte hai
 While it is not possible to digest banana leaves directly, foods stored in banana leaves absorb polyphenols
 isse sharir ko in oxidents kaa phayda bhi mil jaataa he
 Along with this, it is believed that banana leaves have anti-bacterial properties that eliminate bacteria present in food
 isse biimaar padane kii ashanka kam ho jaati he
 2
 swaad bad jaataa hakele kii pattiyon par mom ke jaisi ek upree parat hoti he
 Although this layer is very thin, but it tastes very different
 jab garm khaanaa kele ke pattey par parosa jaataa he to ye mom pighalkar khaane main mil jaati he
 Which increases the taste of food
 3
 Good for the Environment Today, while the protection of the environment has become an important issue, eating food on a banana leaf is a meaningful initiative in terms of environmental protection
 aamtaur par log bhoj yaa phir kisi samaaroh main plastic yaa sterophom ke plates kaa istemaal karte hai
 They are simply thrown away after use
 jabaki kele ke patton ko dikampoj karnaa bahut hi aasaan he
 4
 hyanickele kii pattiyon ko bahut adhik saaf karne kii jarurat nahin hoti he
 They are very hygienic by themselves
 inhen sirf thode se pani se saaf karke istemaal main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Food in a plastic plate is harmful to health
 5
 The biggest benefit of eating in a chemical-free and soothing banana leaf is that it does not allow any chemical substance to enter our body
 jabaki plastic kii plate main khaane se pighali hui plastic kaa kuch ansh hamaare sharir main bhi chalaa jaataa he
 Which can also cause terrible disease like cancer
 aise main kele ke pattey par khaanaa khaanaa swasthya ke lihaaj se bahut phydemand he
 Also, it is also very big, on which all things can be served well

 uttarakhand main kudarat ne jo tabaahi machaai, usase kai sawaal khadey hue hai
 The biggest question was that what happened on the mountains was the right time? Probably not, nature never caused such havoc in June
 june ke maheene main barish ne kabhi aisi barbaadi nahin machaai
 The whole world was shocked by what happened on the mountains and many questions were raised one after the other
 sawaal ye ki june main kyon badla mausam kaa mizaaj? june main kyon tutaa barish kaa record?aisa nahin he ki pahaado par baari barish nahin hoti
 It is not that the mountains do not flood
 sawaal kudarat ke khaufnak chehre ko lekar nahin balki sawaal kudarat ke raudra rup ke vakt ko lekar he
 The mountains receive heavy rains almost every year, but this time in June, nature caused a furore
 aisi barish hui ki dekhte hi dekhte alaknanda akadane maarane lagi
 Mandakini became huge and Bhagirathi dreaded
 aise main sawaal khadey hue- june main pahaado par baadh kyon? june main kudarat kaa kahar kyon?sthaneey logon ko, sailaaniyon ko or chaar dham kii yatra par gaye shraddhaluon ko shaayad hi is baat kaa ilm rahaa hoga ki is baar mausam ke tevar vakt se pehle badal jaaenge or kudarat kahar barapa degi
 The rain and flood that was to be heard after 15 days, took thousands of lives in its grip ahead of time and caused havoc
 sirf pahaadon par hi nahin, maidani ilaakon main bhi is baar barish saalon ke record tod rahi he
 This year in Bhopal, the records of the last 75 years were broken
 1938 ke baad pehali baar bhopal ne aisi barish dekhi
 Rainfall in other parts of the country has also broken records
 ummid se zyada or vakt se pehle jhamajham barsaat ho rahi he
 But the question is why? Why the weather patterns are changing? Is this a sign of any big danger coming? Monsoon has become drunk not only in the mountains but also in the plains
 ausat se zyada or vakt se pehle jhamajham barish ho rahi he
 Weather experts say that this is the first time in 150 years
 aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi ki desh ke 77 fisadi hisse main zyada barish darj kii gai he
 Be it Dehradun or Delhi, Bhopal or Amritsar, Srinagar or Mumbai
 desh ke har kone main is saal june main barish kaa record tutaa
 In the last ten years on the mountains of Uttarakhand, there has never been so much rain in the month of June
 aankadon ke anusaar uttarakhand main 2004 main 359
 There was 3 mm of rain
 2008 main yahaan 593
 8 mm of rain was recorded
 2011 main uttarakhand main 386
 5 mm of rain and 401 so far this year
 8 mimi barish record kii ja chuki he
 While there is still two months of rain
 amuman july or agast main jhamajham barish hoti he lekin mausam ke jaankaron kaa daawa he ki is saal ab tak desh bhar main 77 fisadi zyada barish ho chuki he jo pichley 150 saalon kaa record he
 If we look at the rainfall figures in other parts of the country, then it is found that 120 percent rainfall is more in northwest India
 madhya bharat ke tamaam ilaakon main 90 fisadi barish zyada record kii gai he
 Talking about South India, even here the monsoon dark clouds have been 46 percent more rainy
 keval purvottar bharat main is baar june ke maheene main monsoon kii barish saamaanya se 45 fisadi kam rahi he
 This time the monsoon reached northwest India prematurely
 is vajah se tamaam ilaakon main jarurat se zyada barish hui
 That is, monsoon has spoiled all forecasts this time
 mausam vaigyanikon ke mutabik july or agast main monsoon kii sthiti acchhee rahane kaa anumaan he or aise main ye kahana galat nahin hoga is baar monsoon saamaanya se zyada hi rah saktaa he

 The world starts looking perfect
 jivan main chijen badalati rahati hai lekin sachcha pyaar or gaharaa hota jaataa he
 In such a situation, it is the desire of every girl that her boyfriend only later become her husband
 agar aap bhi apane boyfriend ko bhavi pati ke rup main dekh rahi hai to sabase pehle aapako jaanane kii jarurat he ki kya vah acha pati sabit hoga
 So test it on these things: 1) Understand the choice of each other, even if you have a lot of differences between the two
 aapkaa chizon ke liye alag-alag najariya ho lekin zyaadaatar baton par aap use apni said hi paati hai
 That is, it often happens that both of you agree on the same thing
 beshak yah achche rishte kaa ek gun he
 2) Initiative to end the fight Sometimes in a relationship the battle increases so much that it seems that the bus will not happen now
 auradekhate hi dekhte aapkaa rishta brikepaki kagaar par aa jaataa he
 In such a situation, if your boyfriend sits near you and tries to solve things completely, then he will prove to be a better husband
 3) sabhi se acha vyavahanagar aapkaa boyfriend aapkepariwaar, doston or aapke alaava bhi, sabhi se acha vyavhaar karata he to yah bhi ek signal he
 Because the way he treats gaires, it shows the kind of person he is
 4) aapkaa saath detaa haikabhi-kabhi aap kuch aise faisle lete hai jis par aapke parivaar vaale or aapke dost sahamat nahin hote
 Even leave you with me
 agar us samay bhi aapkaa boyfriend aapkaa saath detaa he to yah ek positive signal he
 This shows that he will support you in future also
 5) aapaki baaten dhyaan se sunata hedgar aapkaa boyfriend vaaki main aapaki sari baaten sunata he
 If you judge after hearing all your problems, then you should understand that he will not ignore any of your problems in future
 isse pataa chalata he ki usko aapaki khushi kii kitni parvaah he
 6) In every difficult situation, there are many such changes in life when you break from inside
 aapako lagane lagata he ki yah duniya bharose ke kaabil nahin he
 And at that time when you have only one face that you can easily trust
 agar aisa he to samaj jaaen ki aapkaa boyfriend rhite chois he
 7) Love has grown over time if your relationship has been a long time
 kareeb 5-6 saal biit gaye hai
 Despite this, you do not feel any loss in his love
 yahaan tak ki kabhi-kabhi aapako aisa mahasoos hota he ki yahrishta samay ke saath-saath or gahrahota ja rahaa he to samaj lijie ki aapane sahi humsafar chunaa he

 aam taur par hamaare desh ke log 'bajet' se kaaphi apekshaayen rakhte hai
 People have curiosity about the budget
 pesh hai bajet se judi kuch mahatvapurn shabdaawaliyaan or unke saamaanya arth
 What is 'budget': The accounting of expenditure and income that is made by an organization or government in a year is called 'budget'
 'bajet' latin shabd 'bojte' se bana he, jiskaa arth hota he, 'chamade kaa thilaa'
 In the medieval period merchants of western countries used leather bags to keep money
 baad main aay-vyay kaa byoraa 'bajet' bhi sadan main pesh karne ke liye bag main hi rakhkar laayaa jane laga
 Later, the term 'budget' came to be used for the details of the government's expected income and expenditure
 seemaa shulkdesh kii seemaa paar se vyapaar kiye jane kii sthiti main sarkaar kuch shulk leti he
 In this way, the duty payable on the goods to be exported or imported is called customs duty or custom duty
 ayaatkon or niryaatkon, donon ko hi yah shulk dena hota he
 This gives the government sufficient income
 karrajya dwaara vyaktyon yaa sansthaaon se jo adhibhaar yaa dhan leti he, use kar yaa tex kaha jaataa he
 Institutions under the nation also impose various types of taxes
 mote taur par kar do tarah ke hote hai- pratyaksh kar or apratyaksh kar
 Taxing is a basic requirement for the government, even though it is seen as a burden on the public
 sakal gharelu utpaadadesh main kisi ek varsh ke bheetar utpaadit vastuon or sevaaon ke kul bazaar mulya ko sakal gharelu utpaada kaha jaataa he
 Direct taxes: Income from any person or entity and taxes levied at its source are covered under direct taxes
 apratyaksh karkisi vastu ke utpaadan, aayaat athwa niryaat par lagaae jane vaale kar apratyaksh kar kii shrenee main aate hai
 Income Tax: It is a tax levied on one's personal income from various sources
 masalan, vetan, vinesh, byaaj aadi se hone vaali aay
 Sales tax is the tax levied on the retail sale of goods
 yojana kharcharaajyon or centre shasit pradeshon ko sahaayta ke atirikt centre sarkaar kii yojanaon par hone vaale sabhi tarah ke kharch yojana kharch ke antargat aate hai
 Non Plan expenditure Non plan expenditure includes interest payments, defense, subsidies, pensions, economic services, loans to public sector undertakings etc
 rajyon, centre shasit pradeshon or videshi sarkaron ko die jane vaale rin isi mad main aate hai
 Revenue expenditure: This includes expenditure on government ministries, departments and other services
 isamen sarkaar dwaara pichhali karjon kii byaaj adaayagi kaa kharch bhi shaamil kiya jaataa he
 Financial deficit In a state like India, it has been the tradition that the budget has more expenditure on miscellaneous items than the government's income
 aay or vyay ke isi antar ko bajtiy ghaataa kaha jaataa he
 The amount that remains after subtracting the payment made as interest from the primary fiscal deficit is called the primary deficit
 rajasav sarplusyadi rajasav kii prapti rajasav vyay kii tulana main zyada he, to in donon ke atanr ko rajasav sarplus kaha jaataa he
 However, such a situation is not seen in a folk welfare state like India
 puunji bajatbajet main sarkaar kii aamadani kaa byoraa bhi pesh kiya jaataa he
 This income also includes capital income to the government
 is tarah kii aamad ke antargat sarkaar dwaara rigerv bank or videshi bank se liye jane vaale karj, tregeri chaalaanon kii briki se hone vaali aay ke saath-saath rajyon ko die gaye karjon kii vasuuli se praapt dhan aate hai
 Thus, all these are part of the capital budget
 puunjigat samankisi bhi utpaada ke utpaadan main kaam aane vaali mul vastu ko puunjigat saamaan kaha jaataa he
 Capital goods are often discussed in the budget
 puunji bhugtankisi parisampatti aadi kii kharid ke liye sarkaar dwaara kiye gaye bhugtan puunji bhugtan ke antargat aate hai
 Loans and advance payments sanctioned by the Central Government to States, Union Territories, Public Sector Undertakings are also part of the capital payments
 puunji praptiyansarkaar ko puunjigat mad se hone vaali aamadani puunji praptiyaan kehalaati hai
 This includes loans received from the Reserve Bank, income from the sale of treasury invoices, etc

 she is the sole caretaker of 4 children
 
 2 siblings and 2 cousins as her parents are dead and her grandmother who was their caretaker had a stroke so is bed ridden
 Mashava doesn't want to go to school anymore because she feels like her dreams r not worth anything as she is a young mother to her family
 
 if u carefully look at her eyes you will see the blank stare of submission to what her life is and will be
 So much strength and bravery

 thank u for sharing with me # endviolence # thistimeforafrica # bindibonding @unicefa post shared by Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on May 4, 2017 at 2:48 am PDT saakshaatkaar lene waalon se aankh milaane se kataraana, baat karte hue atakana, bahut adhik bolnaa or pichley niyokta kii buraai karnaa, kuch aise kaaran hai jinaki vajah se ummidavaar ko kisi naukari ke liye khaarij kar diya jaataa he
 This fact has been revealed in a study by timesjobs
 isamen kaha gaya he ki kisi naukari ke liye saakshaatkaar main baatcheet ke saath hi bhav bhangima, aatmavishvaas jaise anya kaaran mahatvapurn hote hai
 Sometimes other reasons become more important than conversations
 is adhyayan main shaamil kareeb 60 pratishat ummidavaaron ne kaha ki baatcheet ke alaava duusare kaarnon se unka chayan nahin ho paaya
 These reasons also include warm hands not shaking hands
 kareeb 40 pratishat logon ne kaha ki unhen company ne bataaya ki saakshaatkaar ke dauraan ve ruchi nahin dikhaa rahe the
 32 per cent said that they were not selected due to late arrival, while 30 per cent said that they did not get the job even due to not paying eye to the interviewees
 25 pratishat ummidavaaron kaa maananaa he ki is prakriya main isliye safal nahin ho paae kyonki unhone maukey se hisaab sahi kapado nahin pahane the
 About 10 percent said that they could not be selected due to the wrong way of shaking hands and sitting
 jahaan tak saakshaatkaar ke dauraan baatcheet kaa sawaal he, to kareeb 40 pratishat kaa kahana tha ki baat karte samay atakana unako khaarij kiye jane kii vajah rahaa
 30 percent said that they kept talking a lot during the interview, due to which they were not selected
 iske alaava company ke bare main jaankaree kii kami or pichley niyokta ke bare main galat baaten karne kii vajah se bhi ummidavaaron ko naukari nahin mil paati he
 The opinion of 700 working professionals was taken in the survey

 austrailia or newjiland main 14 farvari se shuru ho rahe isisi vishwacap 2015 ke liye cricket visheshgy bhale hi pakistan ko prabal daavedaar nahin maan rahe hon, lekin 23 saal pehle isi kshetra main paak team dwaara rache gaye itihaas ko bhi nahin bhula ja saktaa
 It is also true that cricket has changed a lot in 23 years and it is not necessary that the Pakistani team is able to repeat that history
 pakistan kii team main philhal aisa koi star yaa bada khilaadi najar nahin aa rahaa he, saath hi kuch khilaadiyon ke toornament se baahar hone ke kaaran bhi team kii mushkilen badi hai
 All-rounder Mohammad Hafeez and left-arm fast bowler Junaid Khan's exit from the team just before the World Cup is a big blow for Pakistan
 said ajmal ko haal hi main antarrashtriya cricket parishad (isisi) ne gendbaaji kii ijaajat de di he, lekin vah pakistan team main shaamil kiye jaaenge yaa nahin, iskaa jawaab aana baaki he
 The Pakistan team had to face defeat in both odis a few days back from New Zealand
 yah haar bhi team kii taiyaariyon par sawaal khadey karti he
 In such a situation, there is doubt as to whether the Pakistani team under 40-year-old misbah-ul-haq will make history or not
 pakistan ne haalanki 23 saal pehle melbern cricket maidan (emsiji) par imran khan ke netritv main vishwacap trophy jitkar puri duniya ko hairaan kar diya tha
 Misbah, like Imran Khan, has announced his retirement from ODI cricket long before the tournament
 gendbaaji hameshaa se pakistan kaa majboot paksh rahaa he
 This time it will be the responsibility of left-arm bowlers like Mohammad Irfan, Wahab Riaz
 sabaki nazren pakistan ke anbhavi khilaadi shahid aafridi par bhi hongi
 His explosive batting and spin bowling have the potential to take the team far into the tournament
 vishwacap main pakistan group-bi main he jahaan dakshin africa, westeindies, zimbabwe, ireland, sanyukt arab emirate or maujuuda champion bharat jaisi timen hai
 Pakistan and India have to play their first match of the tournament against each other at the Adelaide Oval on 15 February
 vishwacap main pakistan aakhri baar bharat se 2011 ke semifinal main bhida tha, jahaan use haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 By the way, India has always been defeating Pakistan in the World Cup
 baharhaal, pakistan ke paas 1992 vishwacap kii acchhee yaaden hai, jab pehali baar kritrim raushnee or khilaadiyon kii rangeen jersey ke saath vishwacap toornament khelaa gaya
 In such a situation, he will have to repeat that history

 Sunny Heesni is in the entire film
 or sani kii vah art he jisaki vajah se vah bharat main lokapriyata ke maamle main bade-bade diggajon par baari padati haih glamras or sexi andaaj
 Many colors of Sunny are seen in this story of rebirth
 lekin kahani kamjor he, sani ko ab acting or thodaa kahani par dhyaan dena shuru karnaa chahie
 How much Damasani Leon (meera) is a London supermodel in the story and is upset due to some problems in her life
 use ek baar apane project se bharat aana padataa he
 She comes to Rajasthan and realizes some things
 mjedaar yah ki teen sadi pehle mira lila hua karti thi jo rajasthan kii ladki thi
 a sculptor is his lover
 lila kisi duusare ladke se pyaar karti he
 Even in the present he is loved but history does not give up and then the war of past and present begins
 kahani barason puraani lagati he
 There is a lack of new punches
 lagata he diarector ne apni puri takat sani ko glamras andaaj main dikhaane par jhonk di he
 The film looks drawn and the songs mismatch
 star apilsni leone agar screen par ho to dekhne waalon kii nazren baaki chizon par kam hi jaati he
 The entire film is based on the Sunny Factor, but Sunny will have to recreate his acting skills a little further to go further because he has a knack for keeping the audience engaged, just to enhance the talent if needed
 unhen apane filmi kariyar ko syriasli lenaa shuru karnaa chahie
 Rahul Dev's acting is good
 mohit ahlavat ne bhi thik-thaak vaapasi kii he
 Jai Bhanushali and Rajneesh Duggal are also OK
 lekin ek sani sab par baari he
 The matter of earning has been tried to make the film grand
 kai tarah keganehain
 But nothing can affect the way the director has tried
 diarection kamjor he
 The story is loose
 sabakuch saamaanya he
 Sunny's fans will definitely like him in the style of the village
 unhone donon kirdaaron ko ekadam alag dhang se nibhaayaa he
 In the film, she has said that the shortcut to success in the glamor industry is the short skirt, but she has adopted this short cut long ago, now go a little further
 film kaa bajet 15 karod ru
 Let's see how much miracle Sunny can do at the box office

 This time too, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who entered the election battle from Varanasi, will file his nomination later this month
 pradhanmantri 26 april ko apana parchaa daakhil karenge
 In this nomination of PM Modi, the Bharatiya Janata Party will also try to show its political strength in Uttar Pradesh

 varanasi main abhi tak nahin kiya prachaarpradhanmantri in dinon lagaataar deshbhar kaa daura kar rahe hai or chunavi sabhaaon ko sambodhit kar rahe hai
 However, the PM has not yet gone to Varanasi for publicity
 pradhanmantri ab tak pashchimi uttar pradesh ke meerut, saharanpur or amroha main raily ko sambodhit kar chuke hai
 Everyone's eyes on Kashi: The battle of Varanasi in 2019 is quite interesting, it was already decided that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will contest from here
 lekin unase muqabla lene waalon kii bhi sankhya badhati ja rahi he
 While Chandrashekhar Azad, chief of the Bhim Army of western Uttar Pradesh, has announced to contest elections in Varanasi, many farmers in Tamil Nadu are also fighting against PM Modi

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator Film Name: Kabalidirector: Pa Ranjithstar Cast: Rajinikanth, Radhika Apte, Winston Chaw, Dhansika, Dinesh Ravi, Kishore, John Vijay, Duration: 2 Hours 30 Minutes Operating: 3 starrajnikantaki film has been revived
 har koi south superstar rajnikant ke is nae gangster avatar ko dekhne ke liye bekaraar hai
 But before watching the film, let us know how the film is after all: Kahani Rajinikanth who is known by the name of 'kabali', he is released from the prison of Malaysia after 25 years and his enemies are still trying to eliminate him
 , Kabali is also attacked many times, but each time the attack of Kabali falls heavily on the enemy's stakes
 hameshaa sootboot main rahanevaala kabali bilkul akelaa he, kabali kaa ateet behad khushnuma tha par dushmano ne uski patni (radhika apte) or hone vaale bachche ko khatm kar diya or use dhokhe se jail bhijwa diya or ab wo 25 saal baad malaysia se mafia raaj khatm karne kii thaan letaa he or isi dauraan ateet ke kuch raaj khulte hai, jisase kabali kii jindagi main ek baar phir khushiyaan laut aati hai or aakhirkaar super star rajnikant apane dushmano ko maat dene main kaamyaab hote hai
 The first half of the script is quite tight
 film baandh kar rakhti he, lekin interval ke baad kahani kii gati bahut dhimi ho jaati he or film boring lagane lagati he
 Kabali would have been better if it was 20 minutes shorter
 abhinayarajnikantphul form main he, buudhe don ke kirdaar kii baat karen yaa unke fite karne ke style kii yaa phir unke luks kii, wo laajawab dikhte hai
 Radhika Apte has also done a great job in the emotional scenes of the film, although Radhika has less screen space but she seems to be able to leave her mark in the films of superstars like Rajinikanth
 kulamilaakar yah kaha ja saktaa he ki film kii production vailu acchhee he or cinemetography bhi saraahneey he
 Had it worked only on the pace of the story, it would have been a different thing, yet director PA Ranjit is successful in making a commercial action film as his shortcomings hide from Rajinikanth's stardom

 is tounhall Q&A seshan ko live dekhne ke lieyaha clic karen The Bharatiya Janata Party has reduced the aggression of its PM candidate Narendra Modi's election campaign
 is kadi main party ne chupchaap unke vigyaapan ‘main desh nahin jhukne duungaa
 
 
 i will not let the country disappear
 ek angreji akhbaar ke mutabik lagbhag ek maheene pehle shuru kiye gaye is vigyaapan abhiyaan ko ab band kar diya gaya he
 This was seen as being unnecessarily aggressive
 in vigyapanon main modi khud ye line josh ke saath bolte hai
 BJP sources say that it gives an impression that the very existence of the country is in danger, which is wrong
 modi ke munh se ye line bulawaanaa bhi galat idia tha kyonki isse bahut kade tone kaa abhas miltaa he
 Party sources told the letter that Narendra Modi's team was also not completely convinced of the spirit and style of the song in this advertisement
 lekin mukhya abhiyaan samiti ke is faisle kaa unhone paalan kiya
 In the middle of April, in the circles above the BJP, everyone accepted that Modi's image should be softened
 bataaya jaataa he ki narendra modi ne swany isamen pahal kii or uttar bihar main apane abhiyaan main baantne kii niti se apane ko dur rakhaa
 However, some BJP leaders were demanding an aggressive stand against JD (U) candidate Akhtarul Iman from Kishanganj
 unka kahana tha ki kishanganj main musalmaan bijepi ke khilaaf lamaband ho gaye hai
 It should be appropriate in this way
 lekin modi iske liye taiyaar nahin hue
 It is believed that Modi's campaign will now focus more on the 'modi has arrived' mantra
 usamen nunatam sarkaar, adhiktam shashan kii baat kahi jaaegi
 The attempt in Modi's new campaign urging the NDA to get 300 seats is to attract floating votes
 iske alaava modi tathaa bijepi ke samarthakon ko gharon se nikalakar vot dene ke liye utsahit kiya jaae
 Apart from its political campaigns, BJP is emphasizing on slogans of Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao and employment related economic development
 party main yah bhi mahasoos kiya ja rahaa tha ki sattarudh upie kii kamiyaan ginane main party safal ho gai he
 They feel that the atmosphere has become in favor of Modi and hence the message should be a little brighter
 bijepi ke vigyaapan prachaar geet ko prasoon joshi ne likhaa tha or gaaya tha sukhwindar ne
 Now Modi's advertisements are being made positive
 unke jariye modi janata se spasht bahumat kii maang karenge

 com / lzcphbwqkz srinagar ke ek hotel main major litul gogoi ke saath pakadi gai ladki kii maa ne major par gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 The girl's mother has said that Gogai had come to her house several times at night and was accompanied by Sameer Ahmed, who was also seen in the hotel
 gauratlab he ki major litul gogoi pichley saal badgam main patharbaajon se bachaav ke liye ek aam naagarik ko army kii jeep kii bonut par baandhakar darjanon gaanvon main ghumaane par charchaa main aae the
 Significantly, Major Gogoi was caught with a girl in a hotel in Srinagar
 buudhvaar ko police ne gogoi, samir ahamed or ladki se poochtacha kii
 The hotel staff was refusing to give them a room, after which Major's argument with the staff and the police detained Major
 baad main unhen unki unit ko saunp diya gaya
 The police came to know that a room in the hotel by the name of Leetul Gogoi was already booked
 badgam ke ek gaanv main rahane vaali ladki kii maa ne kaha ki 'vah subah ghar se yah kah kar nikali thi ki bank ja rahi he or uske baad nahin lauti
 We came to know about this incident when the police call came to the sarpanch of the village
 'unhone daawa kiya gogoi kai baar unke ghar main aa chuke hai, vah bhi raat main
 He said, 'they would often threaten our house at night
 gogoi ko dekh kar to meri haalat kharaab ho jaati thi
 Sameer used to talk to my daughter
 kuch shankaa to thi, lekin kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki meri ladki unke saath ek hotel main milegi
 'he said,' When one night Major Majulitul Gogoi entered our house and started asking about our situation, i fainted
 'unhone bataaya ki unki ladki kii umr 17 saal he
 But police say the girl is adult
 ladki kaa bayaan lekar use chhod diya gaya he
 Former Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has paraded 130 of his supporting mlas in front of the President
 isse pehle unhonerajyapal kesarinath treepathi se mulaakaat kar mukhyamantri banane kaa daawa pesh kiya tha
 His demand was that within 48 hours, Governor Jitan Ram should ask Manjhi to prove his majority
 aisa na hone paranitish nagediu adhyaksh sharad yadav, argedy pramukh lalu prasad or samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ke saath raashtrapati bhawan kaa darwaja khatkhataya or guhaar lagaai
 By the way, Nitish has got a double shock at the moment
 ek to rajyapal ne unki baat nahin suni, duusare patna hai court ne nitish ke vidhayak dal kaa netaa chune jane ko gaiyrkanoonee maan liya
 Now the matter will be heard on 17 February in the High Court, while on 20 February Manjhi will try to prove majority in the Assembly
 in sabake baavjood nitish ke paas ab bhi kuch maukey hai-pehla mauka: agar maanjhi vidhaan sabha main bahumat sabit nahin kar paae to rajyapal nitish ko bhi mauka de sakate hai
 The best thing for Nitish would be to retain the support of the mlas whom he paraded before the President and prove his majority in the Assembly
 doosraa mauka: maanjhi ko jediu ke jin vidhayakon kaa samarthan mil rahaa he unamem kuch to unke dalit samudaay se hai or kuch mantri banane ke liye saath khadey hai
 If Nitish can assure such mlas that they can get ministerial post even if they can support Nitish, then they can support him
 isse bahumat sabit karne kii unki raah aasaan ho jaaegi
 Third chance: In the event of not being able to prove majority in the assembly, Nitish can project himself as a martyr
 sari tohamat bijepi par thope kar nitish logon kii sahanubhuti bator sakate hai jo aane vaale chunaavon main unhen phayda pahunchaa sakati he
 Fourth chance: Lalu and Mulayam join hands with Nitish to become muslim-yadav vote bank
 nitish ke khate main khud unki birdari kaa vot bank he hi
 In this way, Nitish together with Lalu and Mulayam can prove BJP as the villain of the political game of Bihar
 paanchavaa mauka:nitish ke paas aakhri opshan ye he ki vah abhi se chunaav kii taiyaari main jute jaaen
 For this, they have a long time of seven-eight months
 is dauraan wo apane ummidavaaron kaa thok bajaakar chayan karne ke saath hi ek majboot chunavi ranneeti taiyaar kar sakate hai

 Chinese companies want that once again Prime Minister Narendra Modi wins in Gujarat

 chini akhbaar global times main kaha gaya he ki agar gujarat main modi ko badi jeet milti he to unka aarthik riform kaa silsilaa jari rah saktaa he, jiskaa intjaar hi chini companiyaan kar rahi hai
 The amount of investment in India from China has increased for quite some time
 kai chini companiyon ko yah vishwaas he ki bharat ke nae or bade bazaar ke rup main taiyaar ho rahaa he
 For this, Modi is taking economic decisions to the government, they can be beneficial for Chinese companies
 ye bhi padhein
 
 
 The most important thing that will be decided on the Gujarat election, and some companies of China fear that if Modi loses in Gujarat, the tough economic decisions are being taken by them at the Center
 chunki, gujarat ke baad kai anya rajyon main chunaav hone hai
 After the election results, the BJP may also get a setback in other states, which will be huge
 akhbaar ke anusaar, modi ne jo abhi tak faisle liye hai, unpar arthshaastriyon or vipaksh ne unpar hamalaa bolaa he
 But only the people of Gujarat can assess Modi's Gujarat model correctly
 gujarat kaa nateeja kuch bhi ho iskaa asar modi kii chhavi or unke kaam kar ne kii niti par jarur padhegaa
 The newspaper has said that China should monitor bjp's performance in Gujarat
 akhbaar main likhaa he ki bharat main chini companiyon ko gujarat ke nateezon ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 Since the result itself will go the way of economic decisions in the coming time
 ye bhi padhein
 
 
 The mandate of Gujarat is more important for PM Modi than Rahul

 There were many issues that completely dominated this election, in other words, the people supported PM Modi on these issues and confirmed his victory
 bhartiya janata party ke netaaon ne bhi inhen muddon ko janata ke bich rakhaa or baat kii
 This is the first time in the electoral history that the Bharatiya Janata Party has got so many seats
 to aaie jaanate hai un muddon ke bare main jo puure chunaav main haaavee rahe
 
 
 1-nationalism Bharatiya Janata Party is a party on the path of nationalism
 ek taraf jahaan vipakshi dal is mudde par 'soft corner' apanaate dikhte hai, vahiin bijepi use apana agenda maanati rahi he
 Talking about the leaders of BJP, Narendra Modi is considered as an eloquent speaker of this issue because in his statements and speeches there is more emphasis on that first nation and later party or family
 unhone apane bhaashanon main rashtrawaad ko sarvocch rakhaa
 Not only Modi, but other leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party also emphasized the issue of nationalism in rallies
 2-rashtriya suraksharashtra kii suraksha aantarik khatre se ho yaa bahya chunautiyon se, narendra modi kehete rahe hai ki unki sarkaar ne donon morchon par hindustan ko surakshit banaaya he
 He also included this in his election speeches and emphasized it wherever rallies were held
 aantarik khatre ke mudde par unhone naksalwad or ugravad par lagaam lagane kaa daawa kiya
 According to him, he has worked to convert 'red Corridor' into Green Corridor
 hinsa kaa rasta akhriyaar karne vaale asaamaajik tatwon ko mukhyadhara kii raajnneeti main laane kii ve baat karte rahe hai
 3 - Terrorism terrorism is the name of Pakistan
 narendra modi ke mutabik unhone pakistan ko har morche par alag thalag kar use jataa diya ki vaarta or aatankwaad donon saath-saath nahin chal sakate
 However, Pakistan was not impressed by this appeal and its terrorist acts continued unabated
 jaisaa ki pradhanmantri apane bhaashanon main bolte rahe hai ki bharat is mudde ko duniya ke kai deshon main le gaya, unhen jataa diya ki pakistan na sirf dakshin asia kii shanti ke liye khatra he balki samgr duniya iske hinsak radar par he
 4- The issue of Hindutva Hinduism is also like nationalism towards which other parties appear to be adopting 'soft approach' but the BJP has been vocal on this
 tabhi ram mandir or uniform civil code kii baat hoti rahi he
 Although Narendra Modi has refrained from speaking openly on this issue, his rites of worship duly at the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi and more recently at kedarnath-badrinath show that the issue which other parties are likely to pursue during the election season BJP has gone far ahead
 5-swatchta abhiyaanis chunaav main agar koi mudda sabase zyada uthaaya gaya to vah he swatchta abhiyaan
 The Prime Minister mentioned this in every speeches and explained how his government is different from other governments
 unhone bataaya ki gandagi or mailaapan kaa asar hamaare upar, aas pados tak hi nahin padataa balki duniya main bhi isse chhavi dhoomil hoti he
 For this, he promised to create an open defecation free India
 iske liye shauchalay nirmaan ke abhiyaan chalaae gaye or jaisaa ki pradhanmantri apane bhaashanon main is abhiyaan ko shat-pratishat safal banane kaa daawa karte dikhte hai, isse kaha ja saktaa he ki ye mudda unki jeet main mahati yogadan nibhaa saktaa he
 6-ayushman Bharat yojanabjp and Narendra Modi call this scheme a new revolution
 unka maananaa he ki yah duniya kii sabase badi swasthya suraksha yojana he
 It is heard in his speeches that it is such a wonderful scheme for the poor that crores of families of the country are benefiting and will be in the future
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jharkhand kii rajdhani ranchi main ayushmaan bharat ke tahat pradhanmantri jan aarogy yojana (abi-piemjeevai) kaa shubharambh kiya tha
 The government claims that Ayushman Bharat is the first such scheme in the world, under which more than 50 crore people will get insurance of up to five lakh rupees
