 Pranab Pandya does not like the appearance of Rahul Gandhi, the national president of the Congress, so he does not want to meet him
 agar rahul unke yahaan unase milane aa gaye to ve unase aise milenge jaise ek aam aadmi se milte hai
 They will not particularly welcome Rahul as he did to the BJP national president
 balki ve to chaahate hai ki agar rahul gandhi unase milane aaye to anya sabhi kii tarah wo bhi line main lagakar unase mili
 Significantly, when it came to light that the Gayatri Parivar chief did not support the BJP president, it was believed that soon the Congress leaders would try to contact him
 aakhir sawaal pratyaksh rup se 15 karod or apratyaksh rup se lagbhag 25 karod logon ke jude hone kaa he or 2019 ke aane vaale loksabhaa chunaav ko lekar is parivaar ke sabhi sadasyon ko vot bank ke taur par donon hi badi partiyon ne apni nazar gadai hui he
 In such a situation, it was believed that soon Congress President Gayatri could also make a meeting with the family chief
 shaayad ab ye sambhav na ho sake jis tarah kaa bayaan pandya ne aaj diya he kam se kam uske baad to yahi mana ja saktaa he
 Did Mohan Bhagwat give away resentment? Pandya had welcomed BJP national president Amit Shah at Shantikunj but when Amit Shah asked for support for the 2019 elections, he said he would not issue a fatwa while not assuring support
 bhaajapa ke samarthan main apane samarthakon ko vivek ke aadhaar par vot dene kaa sandesh denge
 But after meeting RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, his tone not only changed for BJP but he has given a controversial statement about Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 jisase ab yah sandesh ja rahaa he ki bhaajapa ke prati unki naaraazgi khatm ho chali he
 Millions of people can vote at the behest of Gayatri Parivar chief Pandya
 aise main pandya ko bhaajapa zyada der tak naaraaz nahin rahane de sakati thi
 Perhaps this is the reason why Mohan Bhagwat especially met the Gayatri family chief, after which his displeasure is now seen to be dispelled

 grih mantralay ne sabhi rajyon or kendra shasit pradesh ko avaidh tareeke se rah rahe rohingya musalamaanon kii pahchaan karne ke liye adwijuri jari kiya he
 Now Rohingya living illegally in India should be identified and taken out
 adwijuri main rohigya musalamaanon se khatre kii baat bhi kahi gai he
 This advisory came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the issue of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar
 sutron ke mutabik aatanki sanghathanrohingya musalamanonko bharat ke kilaaf aatanki ghatnaon main istemaal kar sakate hai
 Currently 40 thousand Rohingyas are living in different states illegally in India
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki rohingya musalmaan zyaadaatar jammu kashmir, hyderabad, haryana, uttar pradesh, dilli ensiaar or rajasthan main rah rahe hai
 Jammu has the highest number of Rohingya Muslims in India, with around 10,000 Rohingya Muslims living here
 bharat sarkaar ke saamne 40 hajaarrohingya muslimonki roji-roti se kahin bada sawaal desh kii suraksha kaa he, jo sarvopari he
 The government fears that the Rohingya population, which is struggling with roti, cloth and house problems, can easily come under the guise of terrorist organizations
 sarkaar ko aise khufia input bhi mili hai ki pakistan se oparate kar rahe teror group inhen apane changul main lene kii sajeesh main lag gaye hai
 In such a situation, the government is considering 40 thousand Rohingya refugees who have taken refuge in India as a potential threat of a heap of 40 thousand gunpowder
 aakhir koun hai rohingya musalmaan?myanmar ke rohingya muslim samudaay ko duniya kaa sarvaadhik pratadit alpsankhyak samudaay mana ja rahaa he
 The Rohingya are Sunni Muslims, who speak Bangla as practiced in Chittagong, Bangladesh
 apane hi desh main begaane ho chuke rohingya muslimon ko koi bhi desh apnaane ko taiyaar nahin
 Myanmar does not consider them its own citizens
 myanmar main rohingya kii aabaadi 10 lakh ke kareeb he
 According to the United Nations, an equal number of Rohingya have taken refuge in many countries of East Asia including Bangladesh, India, Pakistan
 rohingya samudaay 15veen sadi ke shuruaati dashak main myanmar ke rakhin ilaake main aakar bas to gaya, lekin sthaneey buddha bahusankhyak samudaay ne unhen aaj tak nahin apanaaya he

 sawaal kaa jawaab dijie
 What does Rail Coach Factory mean? Naturally, the factory where railway coaches are manufactured
 lekin is sidhe se jawaab ko raibareli rail coach factory par lagu karne par aap galat sabit ho sakate hai
 In fact, on 7 November, Congress President Sonia Gandhi inaugurated the railway coach factory in her constituency Rae Bareli, there is no factory for making railway coaches on it
 yahaan to keval kapoorthala rail coach factory se sara saamaan 900 kimi dur raibareli rail coach factory laakar use rail coach main dhaala ja rahaa he or yah sara kaam kapoorthala se raibareli aae karmchaaree or thekedaar hi kar rahe hai
 Construction of the Raebareli Rail Coach Factory, spread over 541 hectares, began in March 2009, but after more than three years, the first phase of the factory has been completed so far
 jo coach aasaani se kapoorthala factory main taiyaar kiye ja sakate the, unhen vahaan se raibareli laakar 900 kimi kaa akaaran parivahan kharch, karmchaariyon ke bhatte, thekedaari kaa kharch jodakar unki keemat badhaai gai
 An official associated with the Rae Bareli Rail Coach Factory accepts that in preparing a coach in general
2
 50 karod ru
 There is a cost of Rs, but by bringing Rae Bareli from Kapurthala, the cost of preparing the coach is increasing by 10-15%
 jabaki raibareli factory ke mukhya prashasan adhikari anil handa kehete hai, ''kapoorthala se sirf bear shell aate hai, jabaki floring kaa puraa kaam, kaanch, khidkiyaan or berth fitting, viring, fernishing or air condishning kaa kaam yahaan hota he
 "on the other hand, General Manager of Kapurthala Coach Factory B
 en
 "whenever a new factory is established, it is supported," says Rajasekhar
 kapoorthala factory bhi jab bani thi to germany se patrs aae the
 As a production unit of the Indian Railways, the Raebareli Rail Coach Factory was to be set up in April 2013 in three phases, for Rs 1,685 crore
 ke bajet kaa praavdhaan tha
 But due to the delay in land acquisition, the scheme will now be completed in 2014
 samay badaae ke kaaran factory kaa bajet bhi badhkar 2,500 karod ru
 It is done
 pehle teen varsh main bhale hi abhi tak raibareli rail coach factory main keval coach ke mentanence se judi mashine hi lagaai gai hon, lekin rail adhikariyon kaa daawa he ki agle chah maheenon ke bheetar vah yahaan par coach factory ke nirmaan se judi 'jig’, skin tensing, ioti kraine jaisi badi mashine bhi lag jaaengi
 Presently, given the speed of work, the possibility of installing machines in six months is negligible
 lekin jo mashine lagi hai, un par yahaan kaam kar rahe karmchaaree hi sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 There are a total of 350 employees currently working in the Rae Bareli Rail Coach Factory, but 275 of them are from Kapurthala Rail Coach Factory
 coach main bijli kaa kaam karne vaale ek takneekee karmchaaree bataate hai ki raibareli rail coach factory main fitting se judi mashine us gunvattta kii nahin hai jaisaa ki kapoorthala main hai
 "it takes a long time to get them from Kapurthala after finishing the screw, washer, nut-bolt," he says
 Employees from Kapurthala to Rae Bareli Rail Coach Factory are also unhappy with their service conditions here
 janvari, 2012 main ab raibareli rail coach factory aane vaale 50 karmchaariyon ko to abhi tak ek bhi vetan vruddhi nahin mili he
 Within two months, 40 technical staff have applied to be posted back at Kapurthala Rail Coach Factory
 santusht ve bhi nahin hai jinhone raibareli rail coach factory ke liye apni jameen di
 The factory got land of 1,436 families from several villages including Yusufpur, Bannamau, Ehar, Dakwamau, Sidhauli, Govindpur, Biswapur in Lalganj area
 yusufpur main rahane vaale jagatpal bataate hai ki jameen lete vakt adhikariyon ne har parivaar ke ek sadsy ko naukari dene kaa vaada kiya tha lekin pehle charan main jin 136 logon ko naukari mil rahi he, unamem se kisi kii tainaati raibareli main nahin hogi
 Factory officials are not ready to speak officially
 naam na chhapane kii shart par ek adhikari bataate hai ki gaanvvaalon se bhartiya rail main naukari dene kaa vaada kiya tha, jise unhone raibareli coach factory samaj liya
 "this factory will not provide employment to the people of Rae Bareli," says Ramlakhan Pasi, a BSP leader and candidate from Rae Bareli parliamentary constituency, who has voiced against the irregularities of the Rail Coach Factory
 na hi yahaan ke kaarkaanon se koi saamaan kharidegi
 It is fraud to trick people before Lok Sabha elections
 yah bhrashtachar se judaa maamla bhi ho saktaa he
 Pradeep Azad, a Rae Bareli industrialist and a founding member of the Indian Industries Association, says that the Rail Coach Factory will succeed only if the material used here is manufactured from Rae Bareli's industries
 isse kharch main kami hogi anyathaa aane vaale dinon main raibareli kii band factoriyon kii suchi main ek or naam jud jayega

 The target of Rahul Gandhi was also the local and central government of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 raily main congress netaa rahul gandhi ne kaha ki puure hindustan main teji se mahangaai bad rahi he, ye puure desh ko pataa he lekin piem modi ko nahin pataa he wo duusari duniya main rahete hai

 The Congress government had brought the land acquisition bill, but Narendra Modi opposed it while in opposition
 rahul ne kaha ki yahaan dhan kaa daam kam he, lekin jahaan par congress kii sarkaar he vahaan par kisaanon ko puraa daam mil rahaa he
 Just as we waived the debt of the farmers of Chhattisgarh, so will the debt of the farmers of Jharkhand be forgiven
 main narendra modi nahin hum, kisaanon kaa karj maaf hokar rahegaa
 Economy will stand in 15 minutes
 
 
 rahul gandhi bole ki agar sarkaar amiron ko paisa dena band kar de or ye paisa garibon ko de de to 15 minute main desh kii arthvyavastha khadi ho jaaegi
 But PM Modi wants a scared country, he makes one religion fight another religion, one caste against another
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki maharashtra main bijepi ke log jharkhand, bihar, upi ke logon ko peetate hai
 Narendra Modi is corruption, so he stands with Raghuvar Das because he is also corrupt
 bhrashtachar kaa sabase bada chinh narendra modi hi he
 JMM leader Hemant Soren said that this election is important for Jharkhand because it has become bizarre
 gathbandhan ko dekhakar bijepi taar-taar ho gai he
 He said that the bjp's allies in the central government are fighting separate elections today, showing that the BJP has completely split
 unhone kaha ki jharkhand chunaav ke baad garibon ke upar mahangaai kii waar hogi, kyonki jis saamaan main GST kaa 5 fisadi tex laga he use 12 fisadi kar diya jayega or 12 vaale saamaan ko 18 fisadi kar diya jayega
 Significantly, the congress-jmm alliance's chief ministerial candidate is Hemant Soren
 samaajawaadee partike adhyakshamulaayam singh yadavane somvaar ko saaf kiya ki unki party centre main congress netritv valisamyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) sarkarmen shaamil nahin hogi lekin mulaayam ne iske saath hi yah bhi kaha ki samprag sarkaar ko sapa kaa baahar se samarthan jari rahegaa
 It may be noted that in view of sp's landslide victory in Uttar Pradesh and Trinamool Congress President and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's relentless stance, speculation was intensified here that the Congress is preparing to move the Trinamool by joining the SP government
 is
 mulaayam singh ne spasht kaha ki samprag sarkaar main sapa ke shaamil hone kii koi yojana nahin he
 He said that the SP has supported the UPA government only to keep the communal forces out of power, which will continue
 railmantri dinesh trivedi ko hathaaye jane ke bare main puche jane par, sapa mukhiya ne kaha ki yah trinmul congress kaa aantarik maamla he
 He does not consider it appropriate to comment on this matter
 yah puche jane par ki kya pradesh kaa bihar or gujarat kii tarj par vikaas kiya jaayegaa, yadav ne kaha ki desh kaa koi bhi rajya hamaare liye adarsh nahin he
 Our government will work as per its manifesto
 unhone kaha ki berogari bhatta or kanya vidyadhan jaisi jan kalyankari yojanaayen samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar ne hi shuru kii thi, jinhen baad main kuch sarkaron ne bhi shuru kar hamaara anusaran kiya, isliye adarsh to sapa sarkaar he
 On the question of the exercise of the formation of the Third Front, Mulayam Singh Yadav said that no such thing is going on at the moment
 alabatta akhilesh yadav ke shapath grahan samaaroh main sabhi pramukh dalon ke netaa athwa unke pratinidhi zarur shaamil hue the, lekin isko tisare morche ke gathan kii kavayad na samajha jaye
 When asked about the prosecution of SP workers during the BSP regime and the removal of the cases filed with their persecution, Yadav said that his government is considering in this regard
 yah puche jane par ki kya nikat bhavishya main mantrimandal kaa ek or vistaar kiya jaayegaa, yadav ne kaha ki yah ham par chhod dijie

 Time: Six o'clock in the evening

 And before that auto ride from Hauz Khas metro station to JNU
 auto vaala poochta he- andar jane denge yaa nahin, 24 ghante se to kisi auto ko jane nahin diya? main jawaab de paata usase pehle hi usne phir puch liya- aakhir hua kya he jeenyu main
 Why is there a ruckus? i asked - heard the name of Afzal Guru
 auto vaala kahata he- sahab, hamane to nahin suna
 While talking on what happened in Afzal and JNU, the floor came
 main get par auto roak diya gaya
 OB vans of news channels stopped at the gate
 bairicade lage hai
 i go straight in
 get par guard hai, par rokte-tokate nahin
 i reach Ganga Dhaba directly
 iske baad raat bhar jo hua vah kuch yun he
 
 
 Scene-1: Tea is being discussed among some people divided into small pieces at the dhaba
 vahiin se abivipi kaaryakarta juluus kii shakl main nikalate hai
 Slogans are being raised - 'rashtra Ekta Zindabad, Naxalite goons Murdabad'
 saadhe saat baje yah juluus chandrabhaga hostel pahunchataa he
 There is a small gathering here
 sabha main chaatr, chaatraneta or professor hai
 An attempt is made to explain how the Left is dominating in JNU and how the nationalist culture of JNU is sinking due to Naxal supporters
 seen-2: 'abivipi banaam jeenyu banaai ja rahi he ladaai'ek professor sabha ko sambodhit karte hai- 'jeenyu main mahaj kuch log maahaul kharaab kar rahe hai
 The rest of the students are nationalists
 ' somvaar ko hi apni ek yatra se laute duusare professor kehete hai- 'kuch log yah sthapit karne par tule hai ki jeenyu main sabakuch galat ho rahaa he
 Such people are less educated
 baaki galat gatividhiyon main hi unka yogadan zyada rahata he
 The movement has to continue until such people are punished
 ' abivipi ke ek chaatr netaa kehete hai ki kuch log jeenyu main shuru hue vivaad ko duusari ore modane kii koshish main hai
 This battle is now being tried to make ABVP vs JNU
 'ab bhi jinka khun na khaula, khun nahin vah pani he'ek or professor aate hai
 He starts his speech with 'kashmir Mangoge to Chir Denge'
 kehete hai ki 'jeenyu main unke kuch saathiyon ne itnaa pard liya he ki unhen desh kaa bhala-bura samaj nahin aata
 The blood of those who shouted slogans in support of Afzal Guru should not be denied
 soshal media main aag kii tarah rashtravaadi bhaavana failaaen, kyonki ab bhi jinka khun na khaula, khun nahin vah pani he
 Scene-3: At quarter to nine at night, the students gathered in the Tapti hostel room discuss what happened throughout the day
 hansi majaak chalata he
 It can be clearly seen that there are some of these who have been involved in processions and slogans just to appear on TV
 kuch aise bhi hai jo gharavaalon ke dar se saamne aakar naare nahin laga paa rahe
 Some people are blaming the VC, while some blame the central government for everything
 zyaadaatar chaatr kanhaiya kii rihaai par bahes karte hai or uski paariwarik sthiti par bhi chintaa jataate hai
 However, everyone says that Kanhaiya has become a sacrifice of politics
 zyaadaatar chaatr media main apana naam koi nahin laana chaahate
 Everyone is worried about career
 padhein: JNU main dinabhar kya gata, ye he tahakikatsin-4: raat ke saadhe nau baje, admin blockchote-chote guton main chaatr-chatraayen jamaa hai
 a student quilt is draped in a corner
 kuch log unhen gher kar baithe hai
 Some are standing outside
 har haath main smartphone he
 Some people are watching Prime Time Debate Live in a laptop on one corner
 kuch apane mobile main live tivi dekh rahe hai
 Slogans of 'justice for Rohit Vemula' are written on the walls
 takhtiyon par jabaran rashtrawaad thopane waalon ke prati aag ugalate shabd hai
 People are alarmed to see the photo taken from mobile
 shaq bhari najaron se dekhte hai
 Some students are busy in the discussion about the court room assault and Kanhaiya
 kuch chaatr aise bhi hai jo thodi der pehle abivipi ke juluus ke saath dikhe the
 No sloganeering
 raat bad rahi he or khaane kii phikr ke saath log hostel ke liye nikalate hai
 Scene-5: Periyar hostel is the scene of the Periyar hostel, beyond ten nights of hostility and picketing
 maano jeenyu main kuch hua hi nahin
 The stage is decorated for Cultural Night
 sanchaalak tuuti-phooti bhojpuri or 'desi hindi' main logon ko anterten karne kii koshish karata he
 Slowly, a tour of song, music and dance begins which continues even after midnight
 'uu laa
 
 laa' or 'saat samandar paar
 
 
 'everybody present there swings, plays with whistles and hoots with the students banging songs
 mangeshkar kii aawaaj main 'vande maataram' par ek chaatr dance karata he, lekin koi bhi use 'bhakt' nahin kahata
 Everyone claps happily
 maahaul main rang jamaate hue ek ladkaa 'shaktimaan' kaa theme song bhi gaata he
 Everyone laughs and claps
 12 baje ke baad bhi kaarykram jari rahata he
 Scene-6: At twelve thirty in the night, small groups of students still congregate at the Ganges Dhabadabhe
 haathon par chaay ke cap hai or jubaan par jeenyu kaa maahaul
 When asked the name of a student, he refused to tell
 campus main chal rahi gatividhiyon par usase baat karne kii koshish to naaraaz ho gaya
 Angrily says- 'the study is getting spoiled
 jabaran aakar class band kara dete hai
 There is a hypocrisy in the name of the Left
 teacher bhi saath de rahe hai, yahi vajah he jeenyu kaa maahaul bigadaa he
 Teachers are leading the movement
 agar teacher aage na aaen to kisi kii majaal nahin ki kuch bhi galat kar le
 On referring to the program in support of Afzal Guru, the student said- 'this is the first case in which the leftists are caught
 har baar kuch nayaa khodakar le aate the lekin is baar bure funs gaye hai
 The atmosphere is further disturbed by the arrival of leaders
 kanhaiya bura fansaa he, paise vaale baahar aa jaaenge, kuch rasookh ke bal par batch bhi gaye hai
 Name came but did not go inside
 ' haalanki jab aise logon ke naam puche gaye to usne bataane se manaa kar diya
 Scene-6: jnu's Jhelum hostel is silent on the side of the night
 ikkaa-dukka chaatr lobby par dikhe
 Most doors are closed
 ek kamare kaa darwaja khulaa dikhaa
 Three students are sitting, but none refuse to talk about the campus
 haalanki unhone yah jarur kaha, 'asal mudda jo tha, us par kuch nahin ho rahaa
 Now everything is going at the behest of the leaders
 afjal ke samarthan main kaarykram karne kaa maamla ab do sanghathanon kii ladaai ban gaya he
 Both are performing their power, except nothing is happening
 is sab ke bich nuksaan unka he jo padhanaa chaahate hai
 Scene-7: Tuesday, six o'clock in the morning, then there is silence on the Ganges dhabahar
 kuch log morning walk par nikle hai
 The guard sitting some distance away from the main gate is also sleepy
 main get se bairicade hataa diya gaya he
 Buses are being allowed inside
 get par kisi tarah kii poochtacha yaa roak-tok nahin he
 No police or PCR van was seen on campus nor at the gate
 dilli kii alpamat aam aadmi party (aap) sarkaar ke vishwaas mat jeetne par mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki yah 'sachai or eemaandaaree' kii jeet he
 After securing 37 votes in favor against 32 votes opposed to the motion of confidence in the 70-member Delhi Assembly, Kejriwal told the media, "truth and honesty is a victory

 log in arvind kejariwal ke puraane saathi yogendra yadav ne aam aadmi party kii 5veen varshganth ko ek sundar or shubh avasar bataaya he
 In a special conversation with 'aaj Tak', Yadav remembered the days of the movement and as a political party has also questioned the Jan Lokpal law, corruption-free Delhi
 yogendra yadav ne bataaya ki janalokapal kii bhaavana bhrashtachar se ladane kaa ek sankalp tha
 The rest of the parties cheated on him, understandably
 congress ne lagu nahin hone diya, bijepi ne satta main aane ke baad ajtak lokapal niyukt nahin kiya
 But sadly, the Aam Aadmi Party did the same
 dilli vidhansabha main paas hue janalokapal bill kii kami ginate hue yadav ne bataaya ki aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne khud jo lokapal bill banaaya wo bijepi ke uttarakhand main banaae lokapal bill se bhi kamjor tha
 This bill was deliberately inserted in such a way that the law should not be made
 is tarah ke khel karke baahar waalon ne dagaa kiya hi tha, saath hi janalokapal kaa jhanda uthaane waalon ne bhi dagaa kiya he
 Yogendra Yadav further states that there was a minimum demand of Janlokpal at Ramlila Maidan that the mode of his appointment should be independent of the pressure of the government
 lekin inamen se koi baat is bill main nahin najar ai
 If the central government makes excuses that it is still understood outside the authority of the state government, but it has been screwed that any minister or prime minister will come under its ambit, which no government will accept
 aam aadmi party kedilli main bhrashtacharkam karne ke daawey par yadav ne saaf kaha ki agar kisi sarkaar ne bhrashtachar kam kar diya hota to badi baat hoti lekin uske baad emsidi ke chunaav ho gaye jise sabane dekha
 The people of Delhi are not such that the government which has reduced corruption defeats it in the elections and removes it from the MCD
 yogendra yadavaka maananaa he ki aaj aam aadmi party baaki partiyon ke raste par chal nikali he or is party se sawaal puche ja rahe hai to yah janata kii jeet he
 The achievement of democracy in 5 years is that more people are now questioning him than the questions he used to ask Sheila Dixit
 5 saal ke safar ko yaad karte hue yogendra yadav ne andolan se paidaa hui aam aadmi party kii ek aatma se tulana kii
 He said that this is an occasion to remember the event when democracy has taken a new vow
 lakhon logon ne sadak par aakar sankalp liya ki wo raajnneeti badal sakate hai or badi-badi partiyon ko kaabo kar sakate hai
 For me, that soul is more important rather than that body running in the name of Joam Man Party
 party kii aatma jivit rahi to nayaa sharir khoj legi, or isaki aatma bani rahe yah meri chintaa he

 One of the major reasons for bjp's overwhelming victory in the Lok Sabha elections has been the Modi government's ambitious social welfare schemes
 inamen pradhanmantri jan aarogy yojana (PM-JAY yaa ayushmaan bharat) yojana bhi shaamil he jisase 50 karod logon ko phayda milane kaa anumaan he
 But the budget is still very low for this big scheme and a large part of the country's population is deprived of its benefits
 to is baar bajet main sabaki najar is par rahegi ki vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ayushmaan ke bare main kya ghoshnaaen karti hai
 Will its budget increase? Will the scope of the scheme be expanded to include the poor people of the middle class as well? The answer to all this will be found on July 5, when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the budget
 gauratlab he ki 23 sitambar 2018 ko launch hue pradhanmantri jan aarogy yojana (PMJAY) ke tahat 10 karod pariwaron ko 5 lakh rupee tak free ilaaj kii suvidha di ja rahi he
 The Modi government's ambitious program Ayushman Bharat is one of the biggest social campaigns ever launched in the healthcare sector
 isse desh ke 50 karod logon ko phayda milane kaa anumaan he
 In this year's interim budget, the government has allocated Rs 63,298 crore for the health sector, out of which a budget of Rs 6400 crore has been released for Ayushman Bharat
 yah iske pichley saal ke 2,400 karod rupee ke bajet se 166 fisadi zyada he
 But there is lack of health facilities especially in rural areas
 vahaan kii sampurna aabaadi kii jaruratein puri karne ke lihaaj se swasthya sevaaon ke buniyadi dhaanche paryaapt nahin hai
 The government has decided to establish one and a half lakh health and wellness centers under this scheme, through which the poor will get the benefit of treatment
 isliye itane kam bajet main is vyapak buniyadi dhaanche kii sthapana sambhav nahin ho sakati
 For this huge budget is required and due to the delay in allocation of this budget, the benefit of the scheme will also be much delayed to reach all the beneficiaries
 kya dayera badhegayah maang bhi kii ja rahi he ki is yojana kaa dayera badhaakar isamen loar middle class ko bhi shaamil karne kii bhi koshish kerani chahie, jisane bade paimaane par bijepi ko vot diya he
 Some degree of effort has also been started to expand the scope of this scheme
 kuch rajyon main iske liye pahal hui he
 Health insurance given to employees by the central and state governments is also to be merged with Ayushman Yojana
 kai jagah ise aisi yojana banane kii koshish he, jisamen ek hi yojana ke tahat jile kii 75 fisadi tak aabaadi ko chikitsa suvidha muhaiyaa karai ja sake
 Now it is to see what announcements Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman makes about this
 kya he ye yojana?pradhanmantri jan aarogy yojana kaa uddeshy aarthik taur par kamjor vyakti ko health cover muhaiyaa karana he
 The objective of this scheme is to provide better healthcare to every economically weaker person
 is yojana ke tahat aapke aspataal kaa kharch, de care surgery, follow-ap care, aspataal main bhartee hone se pehle or baad main ilaaj kaa kharch, navjaat ke swasthya jaanch va seva jaisi kai suvidhaayen milengi
 Who gets the benefit of this scheme? 74 karod pariwaron ko milegaa
 These families are selected on the basis of the socio-economic Caste Census (SECC)
 isamen gramin kshetra ke garib parivaar or shahari kshetra ke aarthik taur par kamjor pariwaron ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 Families who will get benefit of this scheme

 He said that India does not agree with the 'first I' attitude of US President Donald Trump on this issue

 Revealing one of life's deepest secrets, unmarried industrialist Ratan Tata said that he too was in love and missed four times in marriage
 ek tivi channel se bhentvaarta main tata ne kaha ki lekin dur kii sochate hue unhen lagata he ki avivaahit rahanaa unke liye thik sabit hua, kyonki agar unhone shaadi kar lee hoti to sthiti kaaphi jatil hoti
 He said, if you ask if i ever had a heart, let me tell you that i was serious about getting married four times and every time i backed out of fear
 apane pyaar ke dinon ke bare main tata ne kaha, jab main america main kaam kar rahaa tha, to shaayad main pyaar ko lekar behad gambhir ho gaya tha or ham keval isliye shaadi nahin kar sake, kyonki main waapas bharat aa gaya
 Asked if he was still in town, whom he fell in love with, he replied yes, but declined to explain further in the matter

 Ratan Tata said, i hope that in the first half of this year, we will select the suitable candidate and i will be able to spend some time with him before retiring in the meantime

 He further said, "my half-brother is a candidate in the race for the president of the group, and i would not be right to say that his chances of being successful in this race are 50 percent or 90 percent or 10 percent
" ratan tata ke sautele bhai 53 varshiya noel tata, is samay samooh kii company ke varisht kaaryakari hai tathaa samooh kii khudara company trent ke chairman bhi hai tathaa tata international ke prabandh nideshak hai

 College education is a significant investment for all stakeholders in India
 15 deshon ke 8,481 mata-pitaaon par kendrit echesbisi survey kii 2017 kii vailu of ajukeshan report main bataaya gaya ki hindustani mata-pita ne bacchon kii skool or college shiksha kii tution fees, kitabon or transport par 18,909 dollar (12 lakh rupye se zyada) kii baari-bharkam rakam kharch kii thi
 The country in which the annual per capita income is Rs 1,03,219
 ho, vahaan yah badi baat he
 According to the National Sample Survey 2014, the personal (out of pocket) spending of studies for general courses was Rs 2,461 for the year 2007-08
 prati chaatr se badhkar 2014 main 6,788 ru
 Done (175
 8 fisadi kii badhotaree)
 4 of Hindustan
 48 karod undergraduate—jinamein 16
 6 per cent students and 9
 5 fisadi chatraayen hai—garibi ke kaaran ucch shiksha hasil nahin kar pate
 In such a situation, it is not difficult to understand why students and parents live in the best institutions
 yahi india today group ke salanaa college survey ke peeche bhi sabase badi prerak takat rahi he—taaki chaatr-chaatraon ko sarvshereshth collejon ke bare main faisla lene main madad mil sake
 The series began in 1997 and has gone through a continuous process of development over the last two decades
 koshish lagaataar yahi rahi he ki isko or behatar tathaa moolyankan kii paddati ko zyada moolyawaan banaaya jaae
 The survey of the best colleges is now in its 22nd year and to carry forward this legacy, we have made some changes in our methodology (see accompanying page)
 hamane nai agency—dilli sthit marketing and deveopment research association (emdiare)—ko yah kaam saunpa he or teen nai stream bhi jodi haih architekchar, dental yaa dantachikitsa or soshal work (pichley survey main hamane keval masters course kii peshkash karne vaali sansthaaon par vichaar kiya tha)
 In our previous incarnation, the notional and factual digits were given equal weight (50 Rs 50)
 itane saalon ke dauraan hamen laga ki dharnatmak aadhaar par collejon ko pehle hi charan main chhaant dena un ubharate hue collejon ke saath ninsaphi thi jo dharna main paaramparik diggaj sansthaaon ke mukaable oonche ank nahin hasil kar sakate the
 So this year we have brought a big change in our methodology
 bahut saare sroton se collejon kii ek fehrist taiyaar karne ke baad hamane unase tathyaatmak data maanga or saath hi saath yah fehrist dharnatmak ank dene ke liye visheshgyon ko bhi bhej di
 Factual data from the colleges were investigated in depth
 antim ranking tathyaatmak or dharnatmak ankon par aadhaarit thi—60 fisadi vajan tathyaatmak data ko or 40 fisadi vajan dharnatmak ankon ko diya gaya
 Due to this change — that is, not to sort colleges based on the perception of experts at the first place — a large number of colleges participated in this process (about 1,000 colleges this time, compared to 259 last year)
 nateeja yah hua ki vibhinn stream ke sheersh 20 collejon main kai nae daavedaar ubhar aae
 The changed method also meant that we do not compare rankings with previous years
 sabase ahm giravat ejineering main ai he, jo apane aap main antarvirodh kii misaal he
 In this stream, IIT has some of the best institutes in the world, while on the other hand hundreds of engineering colleges across the country have failed to fill their seats, which are never seen from scratch
 2016-17 main undergraduate str par kul pravesh kshamta 15,71,220 thi, jabaki kul namakan 7,87,127 (kareeb 50
 1 percent)
 ejineering collejon ne july se shuru ho rahe nae academik saal se daakhilon ko bi
 Tech and M
 tech kii takreeban 1
 Have requested AICTE to reduce 3 lakh seats
 eysitii ke antarim aankadon ke mutabik, 24,000 siton vaali 83 ejineering sansthaaon ne bandi ke liye arji di he
 In addition, 494 colleges have sought permission to close some programs
 isse rashtriya daakhilon main or 42,000 siton kii kami ho jaaegi
 The importance and emergence of private education is not limited to engineering colleges alone
 echaradi mantralay ke mutabik, 77
 8% of colleges are in private hands (64 of them)
 2 fisadi privet-bina sahaayta praapt or 13
 6 per cent are private-aided colleges)
 asantulan haalanki is baat main nihit he ki nijee college kul 67
 3 per cent meet the nomination requirements
 sarkari college ab bhi kshamta se kahin zyada boj uthaa rahe hai
 Our survey has also carefully examined the apprehensions about the high cost of education
 isiilie ek nai khaasiyat jodi gai he—collejon kii nivesh par vaapasi (aaroai) ranking
 This ROI ranking will help alleviate students' fears about placements as well as help them understand how well they can expect a good job (in terms of salary package) and course fees
 Where does it stay in comparison
 haalanki aaroai ranking kaa yah matlab nahin he ki ye sarvshereshth college hai
 Some worrying signs have emerged from the India Today group-mdra Survey 2018 of the best colleges
 tamaam dhaaraon main sheersh 30 main aae zyaadaatar college uttar or dakshin main simate hue hai
 The number of top colleges from the east is low to a dismal extent
 yah is janvari main prakashit ucch shiksha par akhil bhartiya survey 2016-17 ke nateezon ko sahi sabit karata he
 While the density of colleges — the number of colleges per million eligible population — is the highest in Telangana (59) followed by Karnataka (53), Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal are at the bottom of the list
 rashtriya ausat 28 he
 Today our Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) in higher education is just 25
 2 fisadi he (2004 ke 10 fisadi se badhkar), jabaki america main yah 86 fisadi or china main 43 fisadi he
 The enrollment figure in one in five colleges is less than 100 students, while 4% colleges have more than 3,000 enrollments
 haalanki desh 2020 tak 30 fisadi jiiaar kaa lakshya lekar chal rahaa he, phir bhi yah vaishvik takaton se bade baari antar se peeche rahegaa
 The way forward is that the government should spend more on education with more strict attention to quality management
 yah tulana aankh kholane vaali sabit hogi or desh main fori takaajon or ahmiyat kaa vah ehsaas tari hoga, jisaki is kshetra main behad jarurat he
 Consider this: In 2016-17, 1,90,000 Hindustani students spent US $ 44,000 crore in American colleges due to lack of opportunities
 kii rakam kharch kii
 That year, the Union government's budget for higher education was less than Rs 30,000 crore

 abhi ek haftaa bhi nahin beetaa he ki ji-jaan se kaam main jute gaye hai
 The same day after starting the new innings, Nitish transferred 22 IAS officers including Principal Secretaries and Secretaries and entrusted the necessary work to the officers considered close to him
 unhone video conferencing ke jariye jila adhikariyon or police adhikshakon se baat kii or chetavanee di ki agar kanoon or vyavastha ke maamle main jaraa-si bhi dheel hui to unhen bakhsha nahin jayega
 Earlier, Nitish has often been accused of taking the side of bureaucrats, but this time it seems that he is determined that if the babus do not give the results, they will suffer the punishment
 is saal aktubar-november main nirdhaarit agle vidhansabha chunaav tak abhi nitish ke paas saat maah se kuch zyada samay he par unhone apane bharosemand afasaron ko project puure karne or thos nattejey dene ke liye 15 june tak kaa vakt diya he
 In 2006, when Nitish started his first term as Chief Minister, he started the process of speedy trial of cases to curb crime
 yah vyavastha kaamyaab bhi rahi thi
 From 2006 to 2011, more than 56,000 criminals were convicted
 lekin shuru main aparaadh dar kam karne vaali yah vyavastha baad main dhili pad gai
 This time Nitish seems more in the dhuni avatar of 2006-2007 work
 ve 2013-2014 kii us chhavi se kaaphi alag hai jab mukhyamantri ke kandhon par soshal ejineering kii chintaaon kaa boj jarurat se zyada najar aata tha
 They know that good governance can get them more votes than social engineering
 aisa lagata he ki nitish ne apane sabak sikh liye hai
 His dislike for Prime Minister Narendra Modi disappeared when Nitish said as soon as he sat on the Chief Minister's chair, "our political activities will continue
" rajnatik mudde rajnatik manchon se uthenge
 They will not affect the administration
 bihar ke hit main main pradhanmantri ke saath milakar kaam karuunga
 While Nitish has avoided meeting Modi since 2009
 june 2013 main modi ko bijepi prachaar samiti pramukh kii kaman saunpe jane par bijepi se gathbandhan tod diya tha
 Since then, he has been one of the harshest critics of Modi
 jedy(you) ke ek varisht netaa ne mana, ''lagata he, nitish samaj gaye hai ki modi kii jitani zyada aalochana kii jaaegi or dharmanirpekshata kaa bakhaan kiya jayega, utana hi zyada bijepi ke paksh main dhruvikaran hoga
 "looks like Nitish has decided not to confront Manjhi too
" nitish ko sadak, shiksha, bijli or swasthya ke kshetra main sudhari haalat kaa shrey kaaphi had tak diya jaataa he
 All these have increased his height by several inches
 lekin june, 2013 main bijepi se naata todane ke baad se josh kuch kam hota laga or nitish khud ko lalu se adhik dharmanirpeksh sabit karne kii hode main vyast hote gaye
 The administration deviated from its goal and the situation worsened when Nitish made Manjhi his successor in May 2014
 apni badalati tasviir ke liye charchaa main aae bihar main ek baar phir sankeern jativaadee raajnneeti kii fasal lahalhane lagi
 This time Nitish wants to reverse the wind and do something concrete
 vahiin bijepi maanjhi ko saath lekar savarnon kaa satarangi gathjod karne ke liye pasinaa baha rahi he
 Manjhi is also planning a future strategy with his mentor Jagannath Mishra
 donon is jugat main hai ki nitish ko rokane ke liye brahmanon or daliton ko milakar aisa nayaa jatigat gathjod kaise kaayam kiya jaae
 But equipped with a new spirit, Nitish seems to be changing and is humbling unlike the past
 nyaayalay kii sakriyata par gadakari ne kaha ki kuch faisale aise hote hai jo avyavhaarik hote hai
 He commented that how the cricket match will be decided by the court too? After all, where do we build the road? Environmental problems occur everywhere
 kahin jangal he, kahin talab, kahin baghichaa to akhir sadak banaae kahaan? par kuch faisle aise hote hai jo avyavhaarik hote hai

 Comments samachar site 'bajfid' dwaara jari baatcheet kii pratilipi ke anusaar, unhone kaha, 'modi kii shandaar jeet reagan (purv america raashtrapati ronald reagan) ke siddhanton par aadhaarit he, isliye mujhe lagata he ki yah ek vaishvik vidroh he or ham behad khushkismat evam gauravanvit hai ki ham vah news site hai jo puri duniya main yah khabar de rahe hai

 Though the state government does not charge any toll on its state highway in UP, soon the toll booths will start appearing on these roads as well
 sarkaar state hive par keval kammertial vaahanon se hi toll vasuulne kaa man bana chuki he
 Keshav Maurya spoke to 'india Today' at his residence on Kalidas Marg in Lucknow on the afternoon of 13 December
 -aapaki sarkaar kaa focus ayodhya par he
 Roads coming to Ayodhya from other districts except lucknow-gorakhpur highway are relatively narrow? Whether it is a route connecting Lucknow to Ayodhya or connecting Gonda, Basti, Ambedkaranagar, Barabanki, a plan for development of '84 Kosi Parikrama Marg 'is approved by the Central Government
 yah four len maarg hoga
 It will be completed soon by building it at high speed
 iske alaava ayodhya se chitrakoot tak 300 kilometre lanbaa four len ram vanagaman maarg banane kaa nirnay liya gaya he
 -maintenance of state highways is a challenge? Tolls are being taken on national highways but no tolls are taken on those state highways
 sarkaar ne tay kiya he ki upi main state hive par dheron suvidhaayen dene ke saath toll bhi vasula jayega
 This toll will not be charged from passenger vehicles but only from commercial vehicles
 isse hone vaali aamadani se na keval state hive ko durust karenge balki gaanvon ko bhi pakki sadakon se jodenge
 Soon its proposal will be brought in the cabinet meeting
 iske alaava sarkaar ne pradesh main 80 nae state hive banane kaa bhi nirnay liya he
 Work on 67 of these has also started
 -aapaki sarkaar kaa sadakon ko gaddha mukt karne kaa abhiyaan asar nahin chhod paa rahaa he?bade paimaane par sadakon ko gaddha mukt kiya gaya he
 Actually, the pits have been removed from the roads of Public Works Department, but there are also national highways, which are in bad condition in many places
 isi tarah sinchai vibhaag kii sadaken hai
 Different departments like Mandi, Development Authority, Municipal Corporation, Zilla Panchayat have a lot of problems in fixing them due to bad roads because these departments do not have that much budget
 sarkaar ab ek kaaryayojna bana rahi he ki kisi bhi vibhaag kii sadakon main gaddha na rahe
 This is a big decision because there are three lakh fifty kilometer long roads in the entire state
 inamen se dhai lakh kilometre se adhik lambii sadq lok nirmaan vibhaag ke paas he
 The Chief Minister had taken action against some officials of Public Works Department regarding corruption
 aakhir lok nirmaan vibhaag ko ek bhrasht vibhaag ke nazariye se kyon dekha jaataa he?pichhali sarkaron main nirmaan vaale vibhaagon main kaaphi bhrashtachar failaa diya gaya tha
 In UP, the defect is laid on the Public Works Department due to lack of information about the road of any department
 vibhaag main paardarshita baratane ke liye har varsh vibhaag ke sabhi jonal adhikari duusare jone kii jaanch karke report dete hai
 After this, we conduct all these investigation reports separately from an independent agency
 inamen doshi milane par logon par sakht karrwai kii jaati he
 There is no compromise with quality
 i-tendering se hi theke die jaaenge
 If a contractor and officer were in collusion, then only the contractor was dealt with earlier
 ab aise maamalon main adhikariyon ko bhi baraabar kaa doshi tehraaya gaya he
 - Is not completely curbing the overloading causing damage to the roads? Overloading is a very big problem
 sarkaar banane ke baad ham logon ne overloding rokane ke liye kathor kadam uthaae the
 100 percent overloading was also stopped
 isse turant kaam prabhavit hone lage the
 After this, the government took some laxity but now strict steps have been taken for overloading
 -pradesh ke kai gaanv aaj bhi sadak se achhut hai?hamaari sarkaar ne faisla liya he ki saat meter tak chaudee sadak ke kinare based dhai sau tak kii aabaadi vaale gaanv ko mukhya maarg se joda jayega
 So far 2000 villages have been added to it
 march, 2017 main jab bhaajapa sarkaar satta main ai tab 1557 gaanv aise the jinaki aabaadi varsh 2001 kii janaganana ke anusaar 250 kii aabaadi thi inhen mukhya margon se nahin joda gaya tha
 We have built 1762 kilometers of such roads with Rs 1114 crore

 raashtrapati chunaav main electronic voting mashin (iviem) kaa nahin, matapatron kaa upyog hoga kyonki yahi ek aisa chunaav he, jisamen prayek nirvaachak ko apni pehali or duusari praathamikta darj kerani hoti he
 The ballot used in the presidential election has no election mark
 keval do kollam hote hai, pehle kollam main ummidavaaron ke naam hote hai or doosraa kollam khaali rahata he, jisamen nirvaachak ko apni praathamiktaayen likhni hoti he
 In the second election, the voter casts only one vote for the candidate of their choice, but in the presidential election, the elector has to write 1 or 2 in front of the candidate's name to indicate their preference
 raashtrapati chunaav main matdaan or parinaam kii ghoshnaa ke bich chaar din kaa faasla rakhana padataa he
 Because ballots are brought to Delhi from various states
 rajyon main vidhansabha ke sadsy matdaan karte hai
 It is to be known that the presidential election will be held on Thursday and the counting of votes will take place on Sunday
 sansad sadsy yaa to dilli main matdaan kar sakate hai yaa us rajya kii vidhansabha main, jahaan se ve nirvaachit hue hai
 For this, they have to take prior permission

 The candidate who gets more than 50 percent of the vote is declared victorious
 pehle daur kii matganana se yadi spasht nahin ho paata ki vijeta koun he, tab duusare daur main duusari praathamikta vaale maton kii ginati hoti he or donon daur ke maton ko jodakar vijeta kii ghoshnaa kii jaati he
 The comments raashtrapati chunaav main matdaan karne kaa adhikaar unhen praapt he jo loksabhaa, rajyasabha yaa rajya vidhansabha ke nirvaachit sadsy hai
 The nominated members are not entitled to elect the President
 raashtrapati chunane waalon kii kul sankhya 4,896 he, jinamein 776 saansad or 4,120 vidhayak shaamil hai
 All these votes are equal to 10,97,000 votes
 raashtrapati chunaav main upyog kiye jane vaale mataptr main koi chunaav chihn nahin hota
 There are only two columns, the first column contains the names of the candidates and the second column is empty, in which the elector has to write his preferences
 duusare chunaavon main matadaata apni pasand ke ummidavaar ke liye keval ek vot daalata he magar raashtrapati chunaav main nirvaachak ko apni praathamikta bataane ke liye ummidavaaron ke naam ke aage 1 yaa 2 likhnaa hota he
 In the presidential election, a four-day gap has to be kept between the voting and the declaration of the result
 isliye ki matpetiyon ko vibhinn rajyon se dilli laayaa jaataa he
 Members of the Legislative Assembly vote in the states
 gyaat ho ki raashtrapati chunaav guuruuvaar ko hoga or matganana ravivaar ko hogi
 Members of Parliament can either vote in Delhi or in the Legislative Assembly of the state from which they are elected
 iske liye lekin unhen purvanumati leni padati he
 In the first round of counting, only the first priority votes are counted
 jo ummidavaar 50 fisadi se adhik mat hasil kar letaa he, use vijayi ghoshit kiya jaataa he
 If the first round counting does not make it clear who the winner is, then the second round votes are counted in the second round and the winner is declared by combining the votes of both rounds
 tippaniyan They have the right to vote in the presidential elections who are elected members of Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha or State Legislative Assembly

 Asked if the negative publicity of the Games is part of the political conspiracy that his party colleagues have created, Kalmadi said, "I don't want to say anything, let them say it

 dekhie video yahaan: Every intersection of Lucknow was flooded with hoardings containing photographs of Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati on 12 January
 is din samaajawaadee party (sapa) or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ne loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle ek saath aane kaa elaan kiya
 At the press conference, Mayawati said that her party has "decided to join hands with the SP in the national interest"
 '' donon dalon ne rajya main loksabhaa kii 38-38 siton par ummidavaar utaarne kaa faisla liya, jabaki do siten congress ke liye or do duusare sahyogi dalon ke liye chhod deen
 The SP-BSP had come together earlier in 1993, but that alliance broke down in two years after withdrawing support for the BSP
 us vakt kadavaahat itani bad gai thi ki sapa kaaryakartaaon ne 1995 main lakhanu ke viypi guest house main thahari mayawati par hamalaa bol diya tha
 This incident made both parties arch enemies of each other
 12 janvari kii press vaarta main mayawati ne 'guest house kii ghatana' kaa do baar zikr karte hue kaha ki yah gathbandhan raashtra ke hit main he
 a BSP leader revealed that Akhilesh and Mayawati's meeting on 4 January gave the final seat-sharing and both decided that they would field candidates on equal seats as 'equal parties'
 basapa netaa ne kaha, ''unhen laga ki agar kisi ek dal ko zyada siten milti hai to isse duusare dal ke votaron ke manobal par asar padegaa
 The foundation of this alliance was laid in March 2018, when Mayawati agreed to support SP candidates in the by-elections for Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha seats
 bhaajapa ke kabje vaali in donon siton ke upachunaav ke nateezon ne sabit kar diya ki sapa-basapa milakar bhaajapa ko dharashayi kar sakati hai
 Together, these two parties are expected to get the support of 22 percent Dalit, 45 percent other backward classes and 19 percent Muslim voters in the state
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sapa ko 22
 It got 35 per cent of the votes and had won just five seats, with 31 seats in second place
 vahiin basapa 19
 Despite receiving 77 percent of the votes, it could not win a single seat and was second in 35 seats
 agar sapa-basapa ko mila den, to unhen 42
 12 per cent of the votes were received and the combined votes they got in 41 seats were more than the votes of the BJP
 banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay main raajnneeti vigyaan ke professor ajit kumaar kehete hai, ''is gathbandhan kii kamyaabi donon dalon ke kaaryakartaaon ke talmail par nirbhar he
 During the BSP regime from 2007 to 2012, Mayawati targeted the sp's Yadav vote bank
 rajya anusuchit jati ayog ke adhyaksh brijlaal bataate hai, ''basapa shashan ke dauraan yadavon ko essi / asti kanoon ke durupyog se bahut sahanaa padaa tha
 Many such cases are still in court
 '' 2012 main jab sapa ne sarkaar banaai to usne 10,000 se zyada dalit afasaron ke promoshan radd kar die the
 In this way, the basic vote banks of the SP-BSP are strongly opposed to each other and both parties will have to work hard to co-ordinate the Dalit and Yadav vote banks
 lakhanu vishvavidhyalay main associat professor manish hindvi kehete hai, ''2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad donon dalon ne apni takat ganvaai he
 The Progressive Samajwadi Party of rebel leader Shivpal Singh Yadav is making a dent in the sp's vote bank, especially in Yadav-dominated seats

 51 percent of the votes were received and their combined votes in 58 seats were more than the bjp's vote
 congress ke saath gathbandhan ko lekar sapa or basapa kaa tajurba bura rahaa he
 Recalling her alliance with the Congress during the 1996 assembly elections, Mayawati said, "the Congress does not get its vote allotted to the partner party of the alliance, while the ally takes advantage of the transfer of votes of the party
" natijatan, gathbandhan kii bhagidaar party kaa vot pratishat kam ho jaataa he
 "at the same time, Akhilesh, who failed the sp-congress alliance in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections of 2017, said," Congress also has the same vote bank as that of BJP
 agar congress akele ladati he to vah bhaajapa ke vot bank ko hi nuksaan pahunchaayegi
 "congress is more cautious given the possibility of post-election alliance
" congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne 12 janvari ko sapa-basapa ke gathbandhan ko siyaasi faisla qaraar diya or yah bhi kaha ki ve mayawati or akhilesh kaa sakvamaan karte hai
 Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad claimed, "congress will field candidates in all 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh and will defeat BJP
" ''congress khaskar un 23 loksabhaa siton par dhyaan dene kaa mansuba bana rahi he, jahaan vah 2009 main jiti thi
 a secretary of the state Congress said that the party would form alliances with smaller parties
 akele chunaav ladgaye kaa congress kaa faisla bhaajapa ke liye madadgaar ho saktaa he
 Mohan Singh, a professor at Allahabad University, says, "this will make Muslims stay in the loop and divide anti-bjp votes

 But that same question again, what if Virat Kohli would have answered like that on social media ? It would have been one of the biggest issues in India at the moment

 com / nl6dxwdgtu How important this record is for Ravindra Jadeja, you can understand that only Kapil Dev and Sachin Tendulkar have done this feat in the history of Indian cricket
 or ab yah karnama jadeja ke daravaaje par khadaa he
 Although Jadeja is in excellent form, but he does not know anything
 bana den to dhamal kar den, varna aate hi yaa kab khisak jaaen, yah bharosa unhen lekar ho nahin paata
 Let me note that Sachin Tendulkar scored 18426 runs in his nearly 23-year ODI career, while he took 154 wickets
 vahiin, kapil dev ne 3773 ran banaae, to 253 wicket liye
 Although Sachin Tendulkar was a part bowler, but on occasions Sachin surprised everyone with his bowling
 team kii jarurat ke hisaab se sachin kabhi slo medium pesar ban jate the, to terning trek ko dekhte hue spin gendbaaji karte the
 This was the reason that if the captain kept giving him the ball, then the number of his wickets also reached 154
 vahiin rabindra jadeja kii baat karen, abhi tak khele 14 vanade maichon main is lefti olerounder ne 146 match khele hai
 In these matches, he has taken 192 wickets, then has accumulated 1990 runs in his account
 or jadeja ko yah special record banane ke liye bas das ran or banaae hai
 If Jadeja is able to do so, then he will become only the third player in Indian ODI history to score two thousand runs and take 150 wickets
 vahiin aap dekh hi sakate hai ki do sau viketon kaa aankada bhi unase sirf aath hi wicket dur he
 This will be a different achievement

 The High Court has not been relieved in the case of increase in fees in private schools in the name of giving salary to teachers and staff as per 7th Pay Commission
 hoicourt ne somvaar ko apane us aadesh main badlaav karne se inkaar kar diya he jisamen privet skulon ko fees badhaane par roak laga rakhi he
 During the hearing, the Delhi High Court reprimanded the Action Committee for Private Schools, saying that the court will not allow such proxy litigation to the schools
 kisi skool ko pareshaani he to vah khud vyaktigat rup se aakar yachika daayar kare
 However, the court later fixed January 19 for hearing the case

 On December 20, 2017, the High Court banned private schools from increasing fees in the name of implementing the 7th Pay Commission
 ye faisla court ne eesen senior secondry skool ke 88 bacchon kii ore se daayar yachika par diya tha
 Advocate Khagesha Jha, appearing on behalf of the school children, told the court that the schools have enough money, so there is no need to increase the fees

 ) Two prominent accused in the 2G case, including former communications minister a Raja, accused a witness of the case in a Delhi court, alleging that the CBI was pressurizing and teaching it
 haalanki purv sanchaar mantri raja ke purv sahyogi va gavaah aservartam aachaari tathaa sibiai donon ne aaropon ko khaarij kar diya
 Raja's lawyer Sushil Kumar said that he (achari) learns from your (public prosecutor) room
 yadi aap chahen to main aapako isaki tasviren bhi de saktaa hum
 Former telecom secretary Siddharth Behura, accused in the scam, also alleged that Achari was a fully learned witness
 raja ke vakil susheel kumaar ne kaha ki chunki raja ne purv atirikt nijee sachiv aachaari ko raajnneeti main badhaava nahin diya isliye aachaari ne maamle main sibiai ke liye jhootha gavaah bananaa pasand kiya
 Kumar, while cross-examining the Achari said that you became his witness under the pressure of the CBI that you too will be made an accused in the case
 jab raja ne jirah puri kar lee to behura kii ore se vakil es pi minocha ne bhi kaha ki aachaari puri tarah sikhaaye gayi gavaah hai
 Achari denied the allegations of Raja and Behura that the CBI taught them to change the statement and that they are giving false testimony

 Achari told Special CBI Judge OP Saini that it was wrong to say that i was made a witness only when the CBI could not find anything to connect the other accused with the wire
 yah kahana galat he ki main aay se adhik sampatti ko lekar sibiai ke dabaav main tha
 He also said that it is wrong to say that i a
 raja se isliye naakhush tha kyonki unhone mujhe raajnneeti main badhaava nahin diya
 It is wrong to say that i chose to be a false witness against him for prosecution (CBI) for these reasons

 For this, the court asked all municipal corporations, municipalities and panchayats in the state, including Jaipur Municipal Corporation, to keep such forms of birth certificates in which there is a column for writing the name of the mother only if there is no father of a child
 talakshuda ho maa tab bhi pita kaa naam jaruri nahincourt ne kaha ki aisi talakshuda mahila jise court kii taraf se apane bachche kii castady mili ho, waisi maa ke liye bhi bachche ke form main pita kii jagah keval maa kaa naam likhakar janm pramaan patr jari ho
 And by making the same certificate as the basis, in any governmental or non-governmental work, the government should ensure the exemption of writing only the mother's name
 supreme court ne diya tha ahm faislajustise kanlavalajeet singh ahaluwalia ne reportable jajment qaraar dete hue faisla likhaa he
 In fact, only in 2015, the Supreme Court gave a decision to issue a certificate in the name of the mother
 lekin rajasthan main faisle se pehle ke maamle or certificate ke riishu ko lekar sarkaar main bhram ki sthiti hone kii vajah se ye ab tak pending tha
 May be re-issued the Certificate Court has ordered to apply it on the old case and the reissue of the certificate

 He told the people that Tej Pratap would contest from here only if he wanted

 Cleanliness is an issue to which many other taboos and stereotypical social beliefs are attached in India — for example, the gender imbalance in the use of toilets, the concept of purity and pollution in Hinduism that have a close relationship with caste and the inhumane treatment of sloppy Custom
 bharat main 53 fisadi se zyada logon ko shauchalay naseeb nahin he
 In the case of villages, this number reaches 60 percent
 modi ne desh bhar main 12 karod shauchalay banavaane kaa lakshya rakhaa he or iske liye 1
 96 lakh crore Rs
 kharch honge
 There is a struggle in India to achieve this goal, but the other reality is that just building a toilet does not decide that it will be used
 svachh bharat mishan kaa ghoshit lakshya 2019 tak bharat ko khule main shouch karne se mukt karana he jiske liye har gram panchayat, panchayat samiti or jila parishad ko is kaam main joda jayega
 Also, a large section of the rural population, school teachers and students will also be made part of this campaign
 lekin is mishan ke duusare varsh main pravesh karte hi kuch adhyayanon se yah ehsaas ghar karne laga he ki is abhiyaan main kaaphi kuch durust kiye jane kii jarurat he or isaki ruparekha par nae sire se vichaar karne kii jarurat he
 According to a survey conducted by the Research Institute for Compassionate Economics in 3,000 rural households in northern India, more than 40 percent of households have open defecation despite having toilets
 yahaan sarkaar ne jo shauchalay banaae hai, ve aakaar main itane chote hai ki unke istemaal kii sambhaavna behad kam he
 It is clear that the Swachh Bharat Mission will also have to take the initiative to change the outlook of the people, but it shows that for this mission, seven per cent for information, education and communication in comparison to the similar mission Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan of the UPA Government earlier
 Less allocation has been made
 kachra nistaaran ek or badi chunauti he
 According to the Central Pollution Control Board, 4 every year in urban India
 7 karod ton kachra paidaa hota he jabaki sivej kaa 75 fisadi se zyada ganda pani yahaan parishodhit nahin kiya jaataa he
 In urban India, the case is far ahead of toilets
 centre for policy research ke varisht phelo shubhaagto dasgupta kehete hai ki jab tak sthaneey nikaayon ko saamudayik saaf-safai kii maang ko puraa karne keliye paryaapt taqatvar nahin banaaya jayega taaki ve kachare ko vaigyanik tareeke se ikattha karen or uskaa nistaaran kar saken, tab tak svachh bharat mishan kaa maamla aage nahin bad saktaa
 The Swachh Bharat Mission framework needs a radical change to motivate people to use toilets and use machines for garbage disposal
 iskaa koi or vikalp nahin he
 This has to be done
 saaf-safai kaa abhaav yaa gandagi or ganda pani gramin bharat main 80 fisadi bimariyon kii jad he or unicef ke mutabik, paanch saal se neeche ke bacchon kii maut kii sabase badi vajah isse hone vaala haija he
 Modi's inspirational initiative has brought toilet talk to the center of national discourse, as Mahatma Gandhi wrote in his Gujarati weekly in 1925, that "toilets should be as clean as your living room
" " gandhi khud is disha main sakriy rahete the
 They not only cleaned their own toilets but also inspired everyone around them
 gandhi ne jise ''hamaare gande tareeke" qaraar diya tha, use saaf karne ke liye modi kii puri team india kelogon or sarkaron ko saath aana hoga
 The success of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is also the test of many other favorite campaigns of Modi
 masalan, sahakaari sanghavaad, jisamen niti ayog centre or rajyon ke bich samvaad sthapit karegaa; sarkaar main aapasi talmail, svachh bharat abhiyaan kaa lenaa-dena kai mantralayon or vibhaagon shahari vikaas, peyajal or swatchta, swasthya, jal sansaadhan, nadi vikaas or ganga nirmaleekaran, gramin vikaas tathaa paryaavaran, van or jalwaayu parivartan vagairah se he
 Apart from this, people's participation in these campaigns is also very important

 mayawati ne centre sarkaar se maang kii he ki bigadati kanoon-vyavastha ke maddenjar akhilesh sarkaar ko barkhaast kiya jaae or rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagu ho
 Mayawati said, 'there was no communal riots and tension in the BSP government
 upi main bhayyukt maahaul hone ke baavjood rajya ke log puri shanti ke saath ji rahe the
 But now the huge trouble of communal riots and tensions has made it difficult for the people of UP to live
 mujffarnagar hinsa ke liye sapa puri tarah se jimmedaarmayawati ne kaha, 'upi main jab se sapa kii sarkaar bani he tab se lekar ab tak har str par kanoon vyavastha kaaphi zyada bigadi he
 Now the riots in Muzaffarnagar district and its adjoining areas over the last several days over the molestation of a girl have spoiled the atmosphere of peace and religious harmony in the state
 iske liye sahi myne main sapa sarkaar puri tarah se jimmedaar he
 The molestation took place on August 27, but the government did nothing
 sapa sarkaar chaahati to sthiti ko tabhi niyantrit kiya ja saktaa tha
 But this government was awakened when the situation became much more serious and uncontrollable, due to which many people lost their lives and in the end the army had to take over
 'rajya main lagu ho raashtrapati shashanmayawati ne kaha, 'is ghatana se pehle bhi pradesh main ab tak 100 se zyada sampradayik dange yaa tanaav ho chuke hai, par mujffarnagar kii hinsa ne pradesh kii chintaa ko or bhi zyada badha diya he kyonki sena ke lagane ke baavjood sthiti puri tarah se niyantran main nahin he
 The law and order of UP has completely collapsed
 rajya main jangalraj kii sthiti he
 After the present riots, it has been proved that there is an atmosphere of chaos in UP
 rajya main gambhir sanvaidhanik sankat paidaa ho gaya he
 In such a situation, there is a need to immediately dismiss the SP government and impose President's rule in the state
 or agar aisa nahin hota to upi kii janata rajya sarkaar ke saath, rajyapal or centre sarkaar ko bhi kabhi maaf nahin karegi
 On the question of bjp's involvement in SP and bjp's involvement in the riots, Mayawati said, "I do not agree with SP on this
" yah ghatana pichley maheene kii he
 If the government wanted, the matter could be controlled
 par apni is kamajori kaa thikra duusare ke sir phodna galat he
 But it is also what is happening in western Uttar Pradesh right now or before that the way communal violence took place in other areas of the state
 mujhe kaaphi had tak sapa or bijepi kii mileebhagat najar aa rahi he
 Because the SP as well as the BJP also realize that their position in UP is not right
 khaas taur se kanoon-vyavastha ke masale par sapa sarkaar puri tarah se fail ho gai he
 At the same time, Lok Sabha elections are also very close
 donon partiyaan in chunaavon ko tanaavpurv sampradayik maahaul main ladanaa chaahati he

 har jeet kaa alag matlab hota he, lekin north east main jeet kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 There is no question of sabotage in Meghalaya, where the Congress has not got a majority
 jo vidhayak jiskaa bhi samarthan karenge, unheen kii sarkaar banegi
 He said that the golden period is still to come, our government will not be formed in Orissa, Bengal and Kerala till then the golden period will not come
