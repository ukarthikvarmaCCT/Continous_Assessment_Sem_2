 Gujarat Congress on Wednesday took out a rally till the assembly against the rising prices of inflation and petrol and diesel
 vidhansabha satr ke aakhri din nikaali gai is raily main congress ke netaa or kaaryakarta shaamil rahe
 The rally was taken from MLA Quater in Gandhinagar to the Vidhan Sabha
 isse pehle gujarat congress ne kisaanon kii karj maafee kii maang ko lekar aakrosh raily nikaali thi
 Around 80 Congress mlas, including Leader of the Opposition Paresh Dhanani, Gujarat Congress President Amit Chavda, were present in the rally organized on Wednesday
 is dauraan bijepi sarkaar ke khilaaf narebaaji bhi kii gai
 Let us tell you that the monsoon session of the Gujarat Legislative Assembly has been called two days before
 kisaan aakrosh raily ke baad buudhvaar ko congress ne mahangaai ko mudda banaakar raily nikaali
 Meanwhile, Congress leader Paresh Dhanani said that housewives are suffering the most due to inflation in the Kirendra Modi government
 is dauraan congressi 'bahut hui mahangaai kii maar, ab hataavo bhaajapa sarkaar' kaa naaraa likhaa binar or poster bhi liye hue the
 It is known that the prices of petrol and diesel have been touching the sky for the last few days, due to which the opposition Dalalgatar is constantly surrounding the BJP and Modi government
 vahiin, duusari ore gujarat congress anya mudde ko lekar vidhansabha main vijay roopaani sarkaar ko kathghare main khadaa karne kaa koi bhi mauka nahin chhodana chaahati he
 The Gujarat Congress is targeting the BJP government for farmers' debt waiver, right crop prices and rising prices of petrol and diesel
 aatankwaad se har roj jujh rahe bharat ke khilaaf pakistan main ek aisi brigade punap rahi he, jo hindustan ko aane vaale dinon main tabah karne ke liye taiyaariyon main jute chuki he
 The name of this brigade is 'lady Brigade'
 haathon main bandook or dimag main jehar liye ye mahila fidaayin agar apane iraadon main kaamyaab ho gayi, to hindustan dahal jayega
 Training 'lady Brigade' is underway in Pakistan led by ISI, Pakistan Army and terrorist organizations
 pakistan ke saat alag-alag campon main training lekar ye ladkiyaan hindustan main dehshat or khun-kharabe kaa wo khel khelnaa chaahati hai ki dekhanewaalon kii ruh kaanp jaae
 Burqa-shin women will wreak havoc on India
 The terrorist attack on India from Pakistan's land is nothing new, but this time the conspiracy hatched by the Pakistani army, the intelligence agency ISI and terrorist organizations has never happened before
 pakistan main taiyaar ho rahaa sau se zyada burkanashin ladakiyon or auraton kaa ye ek aisa jattha he, jo apane iraade ko amalijama pehanaane ke liye kisi bhi had tak ja saktaa he
 If Pakistan succeeds in this conspiracy this time, then there will be so many innocent bloodshed in India that it will be difficult to count because these women fidayeen who are getting ready in Pakistan are not just to attack, but to attack every such mob The place has to be executed, so that more and more people are killed
 iske liye in ladakiyon ko bheed main ghulne-milane or chhipane kii khaas training di ja rahi he, yani ye fidaayin apane mahila or burkanashin hone kaa zyada se zyada phayda uthaanaa chaahati hai
 In the name of Jihad, filled with the mind of Lady Brigade, there have been bloodshed conspiracies in the name of 'zahra', but the terrorists in Pakistan have started using girls as pawns this time
 That is shocking
 mardon ke mukaable duniya bhar main auraton ke saath suraksha agenciyon kaa ravaiya aam taur par thodaa naram hota he or hindustan bhi isse alag nahin he
 Government agencies in Pakistan's horror want to take advantage of this thinking this time
 in ladakiyon ke dimag main majahab ke naam par jehad kaa jo jehar bharaa gaya he, uski badaulat ye kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar hai
 Now just waiting, then somehow infiltrate this lady brigade into India, so that this evil intent of terror can be reached
 bharat kii ore raftaa-raftaa bad rahi he ye ladi brigadepele unhen dehshatgardi kii training di gai phir hindustani shaharon se waakif karavaaya gaya or tab bharat bhijwane ke liye farji passport taiyaar karwaae gaye
 The Lady Brigade of Pakistan is moving towards India only on the right side
 aise main hindustani suraksha agenciyon ke liye chunauti or bhi badi ho gai he
 These cities of India will be targeted in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chandigarh, Jammu and Kashmir
 iesai or pakistani fouj kii pushto-panaahi main dehshatgardi kii baarikiyaan seekhney ke baad ye ladkiyaan sabase pehle hindustan ke inhen shaharon main kahar barapana chaahati hai, taaki hamale kaa asar zyada se zyada ho
 The news that PAK has received to the Indian intelligence agencies about this nefarious plan of nefarious plan is similar to this - if sources are to be believed, the places where these women fidayeen have been instructed to attack, They include women's train bogies, girls' schools and colleges, crowded markets and polling booths on the day of general election
 saath hi inhen sahuuliyat ke mutabik duusare public transport or yahaan tak ki mauka milane par kuch bade netaaon ko bhi nishane par lene kaa kaam saunpa gaya he
 Obviously, these masked girls want to do as much harm as possible and for this, these girls have been given training in attack by identifying big cities on the map of India
 khufia agenciyon kii maane to in hamalon ko anjaam tak pahunchane ke liye ab pakistan ne is ladi brigate ko hindustan pahunchane kii puri taiyaari kar lee he
 In this route plan of ISI, there is a readiness to send these girls to India through countries like Nepal and Bangladesh
 inamen se kai mahila fidayinon ke liye to baqayada in mulkon ke farji passport bhi taiyaar karwaane kaa kaam shuru kar diya gaya he, taaki ye aaraam se hindustan main aakar hamale ko anjaam de saken

 What is the citizenship of Congress President Rahul Gandhi? Indian or British? This question has once again come under discussion in Indian politics
 bhartiya janata party ke netaa subramanyam swami lambey samay se rahul kii naagarikta par sawaal uthaate rahe hai or ab grih mantralay ne rahul gandhi ko is par jawaab dene ko kaha he
 Swamy alleges that Rahul Gandhi is British, while the Congress says that he is a born Indian
 aise main samajhie ki ye vivaad kab se chal rahaa he or kya he
 > In fact, 4 years ago in 2015, Subramanian Swamy first wrote this question to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 november 2015 main likhi gai is chitthee main swami ne daawa kiya tha ki rahul british naagarik hai, aise main unki bhartiya naagarikta or sansad kii sadsyta radd kar di jaae
 a petition was also filed in the Supreme Court regarding this issue, but the court rejected the application seeking a CBI inquiry
 >janvari, 2016 main ye maamla ek baar phir charchaa main aayaa tha
 Then BJP MP Mahesh Giri wrote a letter to the Lok Sabha speaker, seeking clarification on the status of Rahul Gandhi's citizenship
 jiske baad ye masalaa ek samiti ke saamne chalaa gaya tha, jahaan puri jaanch hui or rahul gandhi ko jawaab dena padaa
 In his reply to the committee, Rahul Gandhi had said that this is just an attempt to tarnish my image
 unhone kaha tha ki maine naa kabhi british naagarikta maangi or naa hi rakhi he
 Surprisingly, the committee also accepted such a petition
 >sitambar, 2017 main ye masalaa ek baar phir charchaa main aa gaya tha us dauraan swami ne twit kar iskaa zikr kiya tha
 He also wrote a letter to Home Minister Rajnath Singh on the issue and now that the election is at a peak, the Home Ministry has summoned the reply from Rahul Gandhi
 kya hai subramanyam swami kaa tark?darasal, swami ne grih mantralay ko bataaya he ki 2003 se united kingdom main registerd Backops Limited naam kii company main rahul gandhi nideshak hai
 Also there are secretaries in this company
 shikaayat main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki 2005 va 2006 main company dwaara file kiye gaye vaarshik ritern main aapaki (rahul gandhi) janmatithi 19 / 06 / 1970 bataai gai he or apni naagarikta british ghoshit kii he
 What the law says? According to Indian law, any citizen can hold only one citizenship
 yani agar vah bharat kaa naagarik he, to vah kisi anya desh kii naagarikta nahin rakh saktaa he
 Dual citizenship is not recognized in India
 iskaa matlab koi videshi naagarik saansad bhi nahin rah saktaa he
 Not only has Swamy questioned Rahul Gandhi's citizenship, but recently when Rahul nominated Wayanad and Amethi, opposition candidates questioned Rahul's citizenship
 haalanki, tab dastavej sahi paae gaye the or rahul kaa namakan sweekaar kar liya gaya tha

 The film 'baahubali' is directed by SS Rajamouli, the famous director of the South and starring Prabhas, Rana Daggubatti, Nassar, Tamannaah Bhatia, Anushka Shetty and Ramaya in the lead roles
 iskaa hindi dab varjan distribute kar rahe hai, karan johar
 The film is made in two parts and its second part will be released in 2016
 'bahubali' ek period film he or saath hi ise hindustani cinema kii sabase mahangi film mana ja rahaa he
 There is no doubt that this film is very grand, its special effects are amazing and the film is a visual treat, that means you will be surprised to see its filming
 kala nirdesan, sangeet, ection, filmakan in sabaki jitani tarif kii jaae kam he
 After Sohrab Modi's film 'sikander', i have liked the battle scenes of a film, so it is 'bahubali'
 takanic ne is film main drishyon ko ek nayaa aayam diya he
 The casting of the film is also accurate and the work of all is praiseworthy except for Anushka Shetty whose makeup and acting both do not leave an impression
 tippaniyan The film's other drawback is its pre-intermission part, which is pretty loose
 ise dekhne ke do nazariye hai
 The first is that the director may have written the screen play from the point of view of the two parts of the film, due to which the first part of this part of the film takes place only to establish the characters and secondly, the director has to give the audience of the south There was also a bit of heroism to be wooed, but i think he could further tighten the screen play
 baaki film dekhte vakt isaki bhavyata ke alaava aapkaa dhyaan shaayad hi kahin or jaae
 So i would say that you should watch this film, because the history of Indian cinema takes the film one step further

 Technology has given a new dimension to the scenes in this film
 film kii casting bhi ek dam sateek he or sabhi kaa kaam bhi saraahneey he sivaay anoushka shetty ke jinka mechap or abhinay donon hi chhap nahin chhodte
 The comments is film kii duusari khami he, iskaa madhyantar se pehle kaa hissaa, jo kaaphi dhilaa he
 There are two points of view
 pehla yah ki ho saktaa he nirdeshak ne screen play film ke do bhaagon ke najariye se likhvaya ho, jisaki vajah se film ke is bhaag kaa pehla hissaa sirf kirdaaron ko jamaane main hi lag jaataa he or doosraa najariya yah ki nirdeshak ko dakshin ke darshakon ko rijhaane ke liye thodaa heroism bhi rakhana tha, par mere khyaal se vah screen play ko or kas sakate the
 While watching the rest of the film, apart from its grandeur, your attention hardly goes anywhere else
 to main kahuunga ki yah film aapako dekhni chahie, kyonki hindustani cinema kaa itihaas film ek kadam or aage badhaati he

 There was a heated exchange between Laker Gibbs and Indian security officials

 In such a situation, if there is a snow storm, there is no way to escape
 aise hi tufaan ne beeti 18 november ko siachin main tainaat hamaare chaar javaanon kii jaan le lee thi
 But the truth that we are going to tell you today is not of Siachen but of the highest, coldest and most dangerous mountain in the world i
e
 Everest
 us everest kaa jahaan aaj bhi laashen bhatke hue insaanon ko rasta bataati hai
 It is the only place in the world where corridors are made of corpses
 kya he deth zone kaa rahasy?aakhir ye jagah koun si he, jahaan laashon ko mile kaa pathar bana diya jaataa he
 And they don't even have two yards of land
 kyon ye laashen insaanon ke liye mil stone bana di jaati hai
 Why it does not worsen even after hundreds of years
 in tamaam sawaalon ke jawaab duniya kii is sabase oonchi barfili chotii par hai
 An icy mountain where humans die
 magar unki laashen vahaan se waapas kabhi nahin aati hai
 Because this mountain does not allow those corpses to come back from there
 laashen ban jaati hai 'milastone'zamin aisi banjar or darre itane oonche ki yahaan tak pahunchnaa zindagi kaa maqasad to ho saktaa he
 But not helplessness
 kyonki yahaan maut zindagi par baari pad jaati he
 This is Everest, the world's highest, coldest and most dangerous mountain
 har saal ise fatah karne kaa mishan banaakar yahaan kareeb teen-saade teen sau log aate hai
 Some are successful and some fail in this snow here
 magar ye mar kar bhi marate nahin hai
 They teach others from their mistakes that the path on which they died
 us par janaa manaa he
 And sometimes their corpses also serve as Google maps for the climbers who come here
 laashen bataati hai rasteverest ke parvat par is vakt 308 se zyada mil stone yani laashen gadi hui hai
 Seeing the climbers who come here decide their destination
 ye log koun hai inkaa khulaasa karenge
 But before that it is important to know how these people who have become milestones on Everest died after all
 ek aankade ke mutabik sabase zyaada maut yahaan pair phisal kar girane kii vajah se huin
 And after that, people lost their breath when the brain became numb due to the cold
 98 saalon se 'milastone' bani laashensarkaron ne ab tak in laashon ko unke apano tak pahunchane kii koshish bhi nahin kii
 Because bringing down the corpses to the ground from this snowy peak is not impossible
 balki andaaze se zyaada kharchila bhi he
 So the Intezamia Committee of Everest leaves these dead bodies here
 ek anumaan ke mutabik agar everest par padi 308 laashon main se kisi ek laash ko bhi utaara jaae
 Not only will it cost 30 lakh rupees, but the people who climb these snowy peaks will be in danger of losing their lives
 barfili pahari se utarate vakt hui mautminas 16 se mines 40 degree kaa ye wo taapmaana he, jahaan ham or aap jane kaa tasawwur bhi nahin kar sakate
 There these climbers insist on climbing these steep hills
 jo takreeban khudakushi karne ke baraabar he
 Some go to an extent and return
 to kuch aage jane kii zid main apni jaan jokhim main daal dete hai
 And these 308 corpses belong to the same people
 jinhone kudarat ke kahar se ladane kii zid kii
 Among those who died, there are many who conquered the summit of Everest
 magar unki maut is barfili pahari se utarate vakt hui
 The corpse known as Green Boot is climbed on this hill of Everest from two sides
 or in donon taraf alag alag duuri par parvatarohiyon kii laashen saalon se padi hai
 These zombies have no names
 bas inke kapadon or juute rasta bataane vaale pahchaan chinh ban gaye hai
 This corpse is known as Green Boot
 jo everest ke uttar-purvi raste par he
 Which is of Indian mountaineer Shevang Paljor
 jo saal 1996 main everest par chadhaai karte hue barfile tufaan main funs kar maare gaye the
 Till date, Shewang's body is lying there and is known as Green Boot
 shevang kii tarah kai or laashen bhi inhen raaston par hai

 We should raise our voice more firmly in front of the court
 ' On the path of Shivpal Yadav in Uttar Pradesh, Bahubali Independent MLA Khuraj Pratap Singh (raja Bhaiya) has also left
 unhone apnirajnneetik partibanane kii kavayad shuru kar di he
 For this, an application has been made on behalf of the Election Commission
 mana ja rahaa he ki soobe ke kareeb ek darjanrajputaur dalit samaaj se aane vaale netaa unke saath aa sakate hai
 It includes from the current MLA to former MP
 lakhanu main shanivaar koraja bhaiyane press coffrence karne kaa plan kiya he
 It is believed that in this conference, you can make a formal announcement to form your new party
 haalanki wo apana shakti pradarshan 30 november ko lakhanu kii raily main dikhaaenge
 Legislator Vinod Saroj Pratapgarh's independent MLA Vinod Saroj's departure with Raja Bhaiya is absolutely certain
 saroj hi lakhanu main raja bhaiya kii press coffrence yojit kara rahe hai
 Actually, Vinod Saroj has been continuously becoming an MLA since 1996 on the basis of political status of Raja Bhaiya
 vinod saroj pratapgarh ke bihar vidhasabha seat se do baar 1996 or 2002 main vidhayak rahe
 Subsequently, he won MLA from Babaganj seat in 2007, 2012 and 2017
 haalanki sapa ne raja bhaiya kii tarah unke bhi khilaaf apana ummidavaar nahin utaara tha
 Akshay Pratap Singh was the SP MP from MLC Pratapgarh and Akshay Pratap Singh alias Gopal, a member of the current Legislative Council (MLC), is also set to live with Raja Bhaiya
 akshay pratap ke jeet main raja kaa kaaphi ahm bhoomika rahati he or wo unke sabase kareebi maane jate hai
 However, if they join Raja's new party, their party membership may be in danger
 purv saasand shailendra kumarakwshambi se sapa ke purv saansad shailendra kumaar bhi raja bhaiya ke saath ja sakate hai
 After Parsiman, a large area of pratapgarh district comes in the Kaushambi parliamentary
 ye ilaaka raja bhaiya ke varchasv vaala he
 Raja Bhaiya has played a very important role in Shailendra Kumar's victory in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 isi maddenjar kayaas lagaaya ja rahaa he ki wo sapa kaa saath chhodkar unke saath jud sakate hai
 If Rajput leaders can hold back the Hathusutras, then many Rajput leaders coming from Purvanchal and Madhya Pradesh are in contact with them
 haalanki kuch maujuuda vidhayak abhi philhal raja ke saath nahin judenge, kyonki aisa karne se unki sadsyta ja sakati he
 Due to this, they will still remain in their parties
 ain chunaav ke samay wo raja kii nai party ke saath jud sakate hai
 Former SP MLA Abhay Singh from Gosaiganj in Faizabad is also considered close to Raja Bhaiya
 haalanki unke akhilesh yadav ke saath rishte bahut achche hai
 In such a situation, it is difficult to leave the SP and go with him
 lekin unke jane kii charchaa joro par he
 Apart from this, Raja Bhaiya has close relations with BJP MLC Yashwant Singh
 yashavanth singh ne upi main yogi sarkaar ke aane ke baad sapa chhodkar bijepi jwine kiya tha
 In such a situation, the picture is not clear about them
 aise hi baliya ke bairiya se bijepi ke vidhayak surendra singh bhi raja ke kareebi maane jate hai
 It is believed that Raghuraj Pratap Singh can field his candidate in Lok Sabha elections 2019 by forming his own party
 raja bhaiya ke kai utsaahi samarthak navgathit party ke naam ke saath unki tasviir bhi soshal media par viral kar rahe hai
 Let me tell you that Raghuraj Pratap Singh won the Kunda Assembly seat for the first time in 1993 as an independent candidate at the age of 26
 iske baad se ve lagaataar isi seat se nirdaleey pratyaashee ke taur par jeet hasil karte aa rahe hai
 He took the first step in politics at the age of 26
 is tarah se raja bhaiya 30 november ko apane raajnneetik jivan ke 25 saal puure karne ja rahe hai
 That is why a big ceremony is being held in Lucknow on 30 November
 isi kaarykram main wo apni nai party kii ghoshnaa kar sakate hai
 We should not drink and drive, this advice gives us every person who wants to drink
 
 
 lekin sachai yah he ki iske baavjood sadakon par nashe kii vajah se hazaron kii taadaad main logon kii maut hoti he
 
 
 Now the Mumbai Traffic Police has devised a new method, which shakes it up, and sends a very strong message about not frying the car after drinking alcohol
 
 
 mumbai trephic police ne april ke ant main ek video film utyub par aplod kii, jiskaa sheershak 'gilt' (aparadhbodh) he
 
 
 This video is the story of a person feeling sorry

 ab flashbek main bos apane janmdin kaa jashn apane saath kaam karne vaale logon ke bich manaa rahaa he, jahaan sharaab bhi pi ja rahi he
 
 
 The boss seems happy when he provokes one of his juniors to drink
 
 
 bas, video phir us vyakti ke ghar par pahunch jaataa he, jisaki maut hui he
 
 
 The boss starts crying in a corner, and walks out
 
 
 lekin baahar nikalate hi use vahi cheharaa phir nazar aata he, apni car ke paas khadi hua
 
 
 Actually this face is of the same boy, whose boss has reached to join the funeral
 
 
 yani, vah bhoot he
 
 
 This ghost is staring at his boss angrily, and the boss then remembers the feast
 
 
 phir dikhaai detaa he, bhoot kii canapati se bahata khun, or bos sadak par ghutanon ke bal baithkar maafee maangata rah jaataa he
 
 
 He realizes that he is responsible for his death due to letting that fellow drive home after drinking alcohol at his party, and this is the 'gilt' that the Mumbai Traffic Police wants to feel
 
 
 video ke ant main mumbai trephic police ne yahi sandesh bhi diya he
 
 
 'be responsible friends, arrange cab after party'
 
 
 tippaniyan Come, you can also watch this video which makes you stand up

 iske baad bos ko ek cheharaa nazar aata he, jise dekhakar vah kaaphi ghabara jaataa he, or kahani flashbek main chali jaati he
 
 
 Now in a flashback, the boss is celebrating his birthday among the people he works with, where alcohol is also being drunk
 
 
 daavat main aae apane ek junior ko sharaab pine ke liye uksaate hue bos bahut khush nazar aa rahaa he
 
 
 Just then, the video then reaches the house of the person who died
 
 
 bos vahaan ek kone main dubkkar rone lagata he, or baahar nikal jaataa he
 
 
 But once he gets out, he sees the same face again, standing near his car
 
 
 darasal yah cheharaa usee ladke kaa he, jisaki shavyatra main shaamil hone bos pahunchaa he
 
 
 That is, he is a ghost
 
 
 yah bhoot apane bos ko bahut gusse main ghur-ghurkar dekh rahaa he, or bos ko phir daavat kii baaten yaad aati hai
 
 
 Then it appears, blood flows from the ghost's temple, and the boss sits on his knees on the road and apologizes
 
 
 use ehsaas ho rahaa he ki apni daavat main sharaab pilaane ke baad us saathi ko gaadi chalaakar ghar jane dene kii vajah se uski maut ke liye vahi zimmedaar he, or yahi vah 'gilt' he, jise mumbai trephic police mahasoos karwaanaa chaahati he
 
 
 The same message is given by the Mumbai Traffic Police at the end of the video
 
 
 'zimmedaar dost banie, party ke baad cab kaa intazaam kiijie'
 
 
 The comments aaie, rongte khadey kar dene vaala yah video aap bhi dekhie
 
 
 This ghost is staring at his boss angrily, and the boss then remembers the feast

 Short grasses found here are the natural supplements of these horsemen
 lupt hone ke khatre ke chalate sangrakshanyahaan ghudkhron kii kul sankhya 4800 ke kareeb he
 They are limited to 5000 sq km area of the small Rann of Kutch
 inaki lambaai 210 centimetre or oonchai 100 se 125 centimetre hoti he
 They weigh around 200 to 250 kg
 ye 70 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar se daud sakate hai
 They are much more agile than common donkeys
 inhen lupt hone se bachaane ke liye hi is kshetra ko abhayaarany (sancturi) kaa darja diya gaya he
 This region is largely under the districts of Kutch and Surendranagar
 lekin kuch hissaa patan, banaaskantha or rajkot jile main bhi aata he

 Previously people here depended only on agriculture
 unhen vipareet paristhitiyon main kaam dhundne ke liye bade shaharon kii ore palaayan bhi karnaa padataa tha
 Don't drag 'wild Ace Century' into electoral politics
 People in the field do not accept Akhilesh's statement as correct
 unka kahana he ki wild es ko chunavi raajnneeti main nahin ghasita janaa chahie tha
 They say that if the tourists come here then our employment goes on
 yahaan ke yuvaaon ne akhilesh ko upi chunaav ke baad asaliyat apni ankhon se dekhne ke liye wild es sancturi aane kaa nyotaa bhi de daalaa
 Wildlife lovers are also angry with the political rhetoric on horse racing known as the heritage of the country and the world

 Where he got a chance to work in Madras Presidency instead of Calcutta or Bombay
 malaria peedit sainikon ke ilaaj ne dikhaai rahdow ross kii zyaadaatar jimmedaari malaria peedit sainikon kaa ilaaj karne kii thi
 During this time he saw that the patients used to recover after treatment, but malaria was so fatal that people started to die more due to it
 phir bharat se saat saal kaam karke waapas 1888 main england laut gaye
 Here he did a diploma in public health
 diploma ke baad wo prayogshaala kii takneekon or microscope kaa istemaal karne main maahir ho gaye
 Theories on Malaria made by returning to India In 1889, he returned to India again and made a theory on Malaria
 unke paas bukhaar kaa koi bhi rogi aata tha to wo uskaa khun kaa sample rakh lete the
 Then studying the same sample under the microscope for hours

 Ronald Ross was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine in 1902
 saal 1932 ko 16 sintabar ke din wo mahaan vyakti is duniya se vidaa ho gaya
 Everyone wants her hair to be long, thick and soft
 khaastaur par ladakiyon ko hameshaa khubasurat baalo kii chahat hoti he
 The more care she takes of her skin, the more she takes care of her hair
 aap bhi bazaar main koi nayaa hair product aayaa nahin ki use kharid laati hongi
 While applying that product on the hair, only one thing will be in your mind that now your hair will become beautiful
 par visheshgyon kii maane to bazaar main bikne vaala har utpaada aapke baalo ko phayda hi pahunchaae, ye jaruri nahin
 Most of the products sold in the market are chemical, so that there is a fear of losing the natural beauty of the hair
 tamaam utpaadon or prayogon ke baavjood bhi agar aapke bal ruukhe or bejaan hai to ho na ho aapaki kuch aadaten iske liye jimmedaar hongi
 Many times it happens that the habits that we consider to be good, those habits prove dangerous for us
 ye hai wo kuch aadaten jinhen ham karte to hai acha samajhakar, par wo sabit hoti hai nuksaandeh:1
 Avoid sunlight whenever you leave the house, cover with hair
 aamtaur par aapane logon ko yahi kehete suna hoga parabaalo par suraj kii roshni padane hinahin dena galat he
 They are required to get vitamin d nutrition for the beauty of hair, but staying in sunlight for too long is dangerous
 2
 Always keep the hair tied, if your hair is beautiful then it is good to keep it open
 baalo ko har samay baandhakar rakhane se bal adhik tuutate hai
 Also, the quality of hair is also affected
 3
 Washing Hair Everyday Washing hair with shampoo daily can be dangerous
 isi tarahashampoo karne ke baad baalo main har rojkandishnar kaa istemaal karnaa bhi sahi nahin he
 If you have scalp oil, do not wash your hair more than two or three times a week
 jab bal puri tarah suukh jaaen tabhi unhen kanghee se sulajhaayen
 4
 baalo par garm rod kaa istemalhot rods kaa bahut adhik istemaal karne se bal jaldi kharaab ho jate hai
 Too much use of straightener, dryer and curls can be harmful
 isse baalo kaa natural moishchar khatm ho jaataa he or bal ruukhe-bejaan ho jate hai
 5
 pradooshan main bhi khule baedgar aap kisi aisi jagah ja rahi hai jahaan kaaphi pradooshan he to koshish kiijie ki aapke bal bandhe hon
 So that there is least loss of hair

 There are the same old wishes in the market, in which after removing the years, sometimes they write Holi and sometimes Diwali
 akar-bakar kuch bhi bake ja rahe hai log
 akar-bakar is a Bhojpuri adaptation of Aabra to Dabra
 ham sab apana or samaaj kaa phaltukaran kar rahe hai
 The English words have become ambassadors of Absurd
 meraa bas chalata to ek shubhakamana police banaata
 Whoever was found to be distributing the wishes of the previous year, had to sit in the room a thousand times and write the same wishes so that he would remember for a lifetime that this is the same wish that the police had taken on sending it
 main bharat main aae shubhakamana sankat ko rashtriya sankat maanata hum
 To overcome this crisis, an All India Wishes Commission has to be created
 ishwar ke liye is ayog kaa chairman ritred jaj nahin hoga
 i am also fed up with the retired judges commissions
 jaise kisi ayog kaa janm ritred jaj ke punarjanm ke liye hi hota he
 It is also my intention to remove the terror of the judges from the commission
 isliye shubhakamana ayog kaa chairman khud banuunga
 i will call upon the world not to send old wishes
 isse lagata he ki purana saal hi you-turn lekar aa gaya he
 Even if you do not send good luck, rainforest still has to happen

 So that he believes that even without sending best wishes, he will be able to live in the new year
 plis, puraani shubhakamanaayon se nae saal ko pradooshit na karen
 Say something new kuch nayaa sochen
 If someone starts getting rich with your blessings, then the leaders will cut off your hands
 apane daftar main taang denge
 So wish yourself well that you do not need anyone's greetings on the rainforest

 The state government and the Morena administration have become active after a severe rebuke from the High Court over illegal mining of sand in the National Chambal Ghari Sanctuary area
 prashasan ne avaidh ret khanan main lipt rahe logon ke bandook ke license nirast karne kii prakriya shuru kar di he
 The Madhya Pradesh government has also deployed a company of the 26th Battalion of the State Armed Police Force (SAF) on National Highway-3 connecting the sanctuary on December 21
 avaidh khanan kii ret kaa istemaal itane bade paimaane par ho rahaa he ki van vibhaag ko adwijuri jari kerani padi he ki nirmaan se jude sarkari vibhaag vaid khanan vaali ret kaa hi istemaal karen
 On January 3, the Gwalior bench of the High Court had directed the state government to deploy SAF in the sanctuary area to prevent the sand mafia
 lekin javaanon kii tainaati ke mahinebhar ke bheetar hi abhayaarany kshetra main avaidh khanan mafiaon ke saath muthbhed kii do badi ghatnaayen ho chuki hai
 On January 8, three tractors carrying sand by illegal mining were seized by the forest department staff and SAF jawans, but those involved in illegal mining threw stones at the staff and escaped with the tractor
 duusari ghatana 14 janvari kii he, jab eseef javaanon par firing kar ret mafia ret lekar bhaagane main kaamyaab rahe
 In the last one month, the mafia mafia forest department has also carried out four fatal attacks
 khanij vibhaag ne chambal nadi main khanan karne kaa license kabhi jari hi nahin kiya he lekin yahaan ret khanan lambey samay se hota aayaa he
 The mining is harming the habitat of the Chambal Sanctuary's aquatic creatures, gongs, dolphins and birds
 avaidh khanan par roak lagane kii maang karte hue hycourt main yachika daayar karne vaale vakil rajeev sharma kehete hai, ''abhayaarany ilaake ke jaleey jeevon ke kaaran yahaan ke pani kii gunvattta bani hui he
 If illegal mining continues, the survival of these organisms will be in danger, it will also harm humans
 eseef javaanon kii tainaati ke baad se avaidh khanan par kuch had tak ankush laga he
 Earlier 500 trolley sand was being extracted here every day
 ''rajya sarkaar or sthaneey prashasan ke liye tamaam kade kadamon ke baavjood avaidh khanan par puri tarah roak lagaana aasaan nahin he
 Actually the Chambal Sanctuary is spread over 435 sq km in the border of Madhya Pradesh
 iske kinare kareeb 170 gaanv based hue hai
 The Forest Department has only 52 security guards and officers to guard such a large area
 van vibhaag ke ek adhikari ke mutabik, ''ret mafiaon ne nadi kinare tak pahunchane ke liye in gaanvon ke bich se raste nikaal rakhe hai
 These people carry sand through these paths through tractor-trolleys
 javaanon kii tainaati ke baavjood chambal abhayaarany ke ird-gird aadha darjan gaanv aise hai jahaan avaidh khanan se nikali ret jamaa kar lee jaati he
 It is sent out at night
 '' sabase adhik khanan rajghat pul ke aasapaas hi hota he
 Sand-fed tractors have to pass through Highway-3
 isliye eseef javaanon ko isi raste main devari ke iko centre par tainaat kiya gaya he
 Police or forest department officials try to stop the illegal sand-loaded vehicles as they come on the main highway-3
 aise main khanan mafia prashasnic amale par hamalaa kar dete hai
 This illegal business of sand mining has taken the form of organized crime in Chambal area
 kai maamalon main to police ke bhi mafiaon se mili hone ke aarope lage hai
 This is the reason why local, ie, Morena and Gwalior jawans are not deployed in the armed forces deployed to stop illegal mining, so as to avoid bias
 court ke aadesh ke baad khanan rokane ke liye task force gathit kii gai he jiskaa netritv muraina ke jila van adhikari (diefo) vicent rahim kar rahe hai
 The task force includes officers from the Police, Revenue and Mineral Department besides the Forest Department
 vicent bataate hai ki sarkari mahakamon se bhi chambal nadi kii ret kaa upyog na karne kii apil kii gai he
 He says, "contractors can use illegal excavated sand in the contracts that local bodies are giving in their construction works
" iske liye tender main hi yah shart daalane ke liye kaha gaya he ki ve sindh yaa banaas nadi kii ret kaa istemaal karen
 Apart from this, royalty receipts and transit passes of valid mined sand can also be seen
 isse chambal kii ret ke istemaal par lagaam lag sakegi
 According to DFO Rahim, due to the deployment of armed police, surveillance has increased especially near Rajghat bridge and illegal mining has stopped completely during the day
 yah ashanka jarur he ki raat main kuch kshetron main avaidh khanan ho saktaa he
 Illegal mining of sand is happening only in the sanctuary area of chambal, it is not so
 gwalior ke aasapaas kai ilaakon main bhi ret kaa avaidh khanan jari he
 Sand mining is also being done in the restricted areas of Sindh river, about 50 km from here
 danparon main ret bharkar bhind or datia se gwalior laai jaati he jisase sadakon ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaa he
 These roads are built for a capacity of nine tonnes while the dumpers carry up to 40 tonnes of sand
 bhind or datia ke colectoron kii jaanch main bhi overlod danparon kii shikaayat sahi pai gai tha
 Screws on the sand mafia in Morena are now beginning to tighten
 yahaan ret khanan ke liye ek bhi license nahin diya gaya he
 Gun licenses of 208 people associated with illegal mining have been revoked and 11 vehicles found in its transport have been confiscated and confiscated

 He said, 'we were brought to this level and they were pushed to the extent that they had no choice left
 hamaari party kii apni vichaardhaara he or yah unki party ke aastitiv ko lekar ladaai he
 Asked whether his heart still beats for secularism and came here under compulsion, Paswan said that secularism is his mission and he is still committed to it and for that his heart will always be beating
 yah puche jane par kya endie ke saath majaburi kaa gathbandhan he paswan ne isse inkaar karte hue kaha ki ve yah mahasoos karte hai gathbandhan pehle ho janaa chahie tha or jahaan tak vicharadhara kaa sawaal unki party bhaajapa main vilay nahin hua he
 He said that though Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi may be accused but during the last one year, there has been no communalism in any of his speeches
 paswan ne kaha ki ek mudda yah he ki vikaas or samaaj ke sabhi varg ko saath lekar chalanaa he kyonki bharat ek bagichaa ke samaan he jisamen sabhi dharm or samudaay ke log hai or baghichaa kaa mali vahi acha hota he jahaan har tarah ke phool khilte hai or baaten unhone narendra modi se bhi kahi hai
 Paswan said that though he has returned to the NDA after 12 years, the people of the country have made up their mind that this time there is a change of power at the center and they feel that this time the NDA government will be formed at the center
 unhone kaha ki lojpa endie ke anya ghatak dalon ke saath talmail kar bihar main saat siton par loksabhaa chunaav lard rahi he jisamen se jamui, munger, hajipur, samastipur, nalanda, vaishali or khagadiya

 ' The Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ) will deliver its verdict tomorrow in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case
 guuruuvaar kaa bhartiya samyaanusaar dopaher saadhe teen baje isije is behad ahm masale par apana nirnay sunayega
 The case was heard on Monday
 bharat kii ore se varisht vakil harish salve ne apni baat rakhi
 India said in the hearing in the court that hearing the matter within seven days of India's appeal, it shows how severely the International Court is taking it
 salve ne kaha ki pakistan ne kulbhushan jadhav ko koi madad nahin kii, main bharat kii ore se yah bataanaa chahta hum ki bharat ke 125 karod log kulbhushan jadhav kii vaapasi kii raah dekh rahe hai
 We want the decision of the Military Court of Pakistan to be stayed without any hearing
 pakistan ne vienna sandhi kaa ulanghan kiya, iske tahat unhone kulbhushan jadhav ko kisi se bhi milane kii ijaajat nahin di
 Hanging Kulbhushan Jadhav is a human rights violation
 bharat ne kaha ki naa to kulbhushan jadhav kii madad kii, or naa hi koi counslar kii madad kii
 Despite India saying that Pakistan did not give us any information related to Kulbhushan Jadhav, Jadhav's parents wanted to come to Pakistan to meet their son, he had requested for this but Pakistan did not respond
 hamaari maang he ki sirf military court kii sunwaayee ke aadhaar par kulbhushan jadhav ko faansee naa di jaae
 Kulbhushan Jadhav's parents are unable to help him, yet Pakistan is not giving any information
 27 april ko bharat ne dobaaraa pakistan ke saamne is mudde ko uthaaya tha lekin pakistan ne hamaari baat nahin suni thi
 The Military Court of Pakistan has also pronounced such judgments before, and they are heard without any challenge
 bhartiya pratinidh ne kaha ki vienna sandhi ke tahat kaha gaya he ki agar kisi vyakti ko pakadaa jaataa he, to donon deshon main use rajaniyak niyamon ke tahat madad milegi, iskaa ullekh artical 36 main bhi hua he
 India is not interfering in the judicial system of any other country, we are just talking about international rules
 pakistan ko niyamon kaa paalan karnaa hi hoga
 Pakistan said in the ICJ that the provision related to consular contact in the Vienna Agreement is not for any detective involved in terrorist activities
 donon padosi desh isse pehle 18 saal purv isije main aamane-saamne the jab islamabad ne uske ek nausainik vimaan ko maar giraane ko lekar antarrashtriya adaalat kii madhyasthata kii maang kii thi
 The first paragraph of Article 36 also mentions that such a case can be challenged in the International Court of Justice
 bharat or pakistan sanyukt raashtra ke sadsy hai or donon hi deshvienna sandhi ke niyamonka paalan karne ke liye patibaddh he
 According to the treaty, the International Court can resolve any differences
 bharat or pakistanke bich main do-paksheeya sandhi bhi ho chuki he, jisamen vienna sandhi ke paalan kii baat ho rahi he
 This case does not come under two-party rules, so it had to be brought to the international court

 guuruuvaar ko bhi prashasnic team ne gram jangarava panhuch kar dub main aa rahe logo ko hataanaa shuru kiya
 Then Laxman, who was blocking the team carrying goods from the house, died of a heart attack
 iske baad unke parijanon ne shav ko sadak par rakh kar hangaamaa shuru kar diya
 Narmada Bachao Andolan has alleged that this is not an ordinary death, after this death a case of murder should be registered against the authorities
 vahiin lakshmana kii maut ke baad hangaame ke bich esadm abhayasingh ohariya par jab bheed tut padi to vah kheton ke raste bhaagane lage
 Angry villagers chased them after the sdm's escape, in which the policemen pulled out the officers from the village by creating a security cordon
 aajkal media sawaalon ke ghere main he
 In the last few days questions have started coming up on the functioning and attitude of the media
 sawaal yah he ki kya media badal rahaa he? kya media ke naitik paksh par aise sawaal jaij hai? Politicians are more upset with the media than ordinary people
 dilli sarkaar ne ek circular bhi jari kiya, jiske jariye sarkaar ne apane sabhi adhikariyon ko nirdesh diya tha ki yadi ve koi aisi khabar pate hai, jisase mukhyamantri yaa sarkaar kii pratishtha ko nuksaan pahunchataa he, to uske khilaaf karrwai kii jaaegi
 The ghost of Warren Hastings is seen in this circular of the Delhi Government
 azaadi ke pehle angrezon ke khilaaf jo bhi likhata tha, use jail janaa padataa tha
 James Augustus, editor of 'the Bengal Gazette', was sentenced to four months in jail, as well as a fine of five hundred rupees, for criticizing the wife of the then Governor General Warren Hastings
 haalanki supreme court ne kejariwal sarkaar ke circular par roak laga di he, lekin yah samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki dilli sarkaar media se itani khafa kyon he? media kii jimmedaari he ki desh or logon kii samasyaon ko saamne laane ke saath-saath sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par bhi najar rakhe
 The government has to face criticism, criticism improves the functioning of the government
 yah pehali baar nahin ki kejariwal media ko gher rahe hai
 In the past too, Kejriwal has questioned the media many times
 kejariwal sarkaar dwaara nikaala gaya yah circular kai sawaal khadey karata he
 Does Arvind Kejriwal want to run the media in his own way? Has Kejriwal changed or is he giving any wrong advice to Kejriwal? The most important question that arises in mind is how can a leader like Kejriwal take such decisions? He understands the media better
 unhone media ke jariye apni artiai muhim ko aage badhaayaa tha
 In the initial phase, Kejriwal reached this campaign through many channels and magazines
 agar media ke jariye sabase zyada phayda kisi ko hua, to vah arvind kejariwal or unki party ko hua he
 For the past few years, the media has shown a lot about the Aam Aadmi Party and its leaders
 desh ke andar duusari samasyaon ko nazarandaaz karte hue media ne jantar-mantar par anna hajaare ke saath kejariwal ke dharne ko lagaataar kawarej diya
 Here, not only Kejriwal, the media is also questioned
 tiarapy ke chakkar main media apni saamaajik zimmedaariyaan bhul jaataa he
 Media seems to have become person-centered
 us vakt kejariwal har channel or akhbaar main ek nayak ke rup main chhaae hue the
 The government was also critical of the media during this entire movement
 us dauraan agar media ne arvind kejariwal ko nayak or sarkaar ko khalanaayak nahin banaaya hota, to aaj dilli main kejariwal kii sarkaar nahin hoti
 Arvind Kejriwal has also said that the media continues to promote Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party
 pichley ek saal main centre main narendra modi sarkaar kii bhi kaaphi khinchaai hui he
 If we talk about Narendra Modi as a person, after the 2002 Gujarat riots, if the media raised the most questions and criticized anyone the most, then it is Narendra Modi
 congress ke bhrashtachar or mahangaai ko bhi media ne kaaphi jagah di
 i am not defending the media
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki media ke kaam karne ke tareeke or charitra main bahut badlaav aayaa he
 There is some truth in the questions raised on the media
 kabhi-kabhi aisa lagata he ki media apni takat kaa galat istemaal kar rahaa he
 Talk of 'paid news' is also being raised
 yah bhi sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya media main bhi bhrashtachar he? media ke kawarej ko lekar bhi sawaal uth rahaa he
 The question also arises whether the media is running away from its social responsibility? media main aajkal saamaajik khabaren kam dikhaai detii hai
 Attempts are being made to lure the audience through snakes, scorpions and ghosts
 jo netaa media par sawaal uthaate rahe hai, aajkal unki khabar media dwaara zyada dikhaai jaati hai
 The reach of the media has certainly expanded, but the media seems untouched by the problems of the people of the villages
 jo ho, har kisi ko ek hi taraazoo main taulnaa shaayad thik nahin he
 There are many news channels and newspapers, which work for the larger interest of society by trying to maintain the image of the media through their honest reporting and analysis
 tippaniyan It is not that the media does not do any good
 desh main hue bade-bade ghotaalon ko media ne hi uthaaya he, kai aise samachar channel or akhbaar samaaj kii samasyaon ke prati sachet hai or unhone kuch vishesh abhiyaan bhi shuru kiye hai
 It may not be much, but the media has also shown the problems of farmers in the last few days
 nirbhaya cond jaise maamalon main hamane media ko nae rup main dekha
 It was because of his activism and outspokenness that the civil outrage over the Nirbhaya incident took the form of a mass movement and finally the anti-sexual violence laws were amended
 sarkaar or media ke bich nokajhonk bhi hoti rahati he, lekin media kii azaadi par roak lagaana acchhee baat nahin
 Media must get complete freedom to show news
 sarkaar yaa rajanetaaon ko hakeekat samajni hogi
 Using the media only for your own benefit and hammering at the right of the media when needed will be like hitting an ax at your feet
 aam logon se zyada rajaneta media se khafa nazar aa rahe hai
 The Delhi government also issued a circular, through which the government had instructed all its officials that action would be taken against them if they received any news which damaged the reputation of the Chief Minister or the government
 dilli sarkaar ke is circular main warren hestings kaa bhoot nazar aa rahaa he
 Before independence, anyone who wrote against the British had to go to jail
 'da bengal gajet' ke sampadak james augustus ko us vakt ke governor general warren hestings kii patni kii aalochana karne ke kaaran chaar maheene jail kii sajaa kaatane ke saath-saath paanch sau rupee jurmaana dena padaa tha
 Although the Supreme Court has banned the Kejriwal government's circular, but it is not understood why the Delhi government is so upset with the media? It is the responsibility of the media that along with exposing the problems of the country and the people, also keep an eye on the functioning of the government
 sarkaar ko aalochana kaa saamana karnaa hi padataa he, aalochana se sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main sudhaar hota he
 This is not the first time that Kejriwal is surrounding the media
 isse pehle bhi kai baar kejariwal media par sawaal uthaa chuke hai
 This circular raised by the Kejriwal government raises many questions
 kya arvind kejariwal media ko apane tareeke se chalaanaa chaahate hai? kya kejariwal badal gaye hai yaa kejariwal ko koi galat salaah de rahaa he? man main sabase ahm prashn uthta he ki kejariwal jaise netaa aise faisle kaise le sakate hai? vah media ko behatar tareeke se samajhate hai
 He had taken forward his RTI campaign through the media
 shuruaati daur main kejariwal ne kai channelon or patrikaon ke jariye apni is muhim ko anjaam tak pahunchaaya
 If anyone has benefited the most through the media, then it is Arvind Kejriwal and his party
 pichley kuch saal se media ne aam aadmi party or iske netaaon ke bare main kaaphi kuch dikhaaya
 Ignoring other problems within the country, the media continuously gave coverage to Kejriwal's dharna along with Anna Hazare at Jantar Mantar
 yahaan par kejariwal nahin, media par bhi sawaal uthta he
 In the case of trps, the media forgets its social responsibilities
 aisa lagata he ki media vyakti-kendrit ho gaya he
 At that time, Kejriwal was a hero in every channel and newspaper
 is puure andolan ke dauraan media ne sarkaar kii kaaphi aalochana bhi kii thi
 During that time, if the media had not made Arvind Kejriwal a hero and the government a villain, then today there would not have been a Kejriwal government in Delhi
 arvind kejariwal yah bhi kah chuke hai ki media, modi or bhartiya janata party kaa prachaar karata rahata he
 In the last one year, the Narendra Modi government has also been dragged at the Center
 agar ham vyakti ke rup main narendra modi kii baat karen, to varsh 2002 ke gujarat dangon ke baad agar media ne kisi par sabase zyada sawaal uthaae or sabase zyada kisi kii aalochana kii to vah narendra modi hi hai
 The media gave a lot of space to the corruption and inflation of the Congress
 main media kaa bachaav nahin kar rahaa hum
 There is no doubt that there is a lot of change in the way the media works and the character
 media par uthe sawaalon main kahin na kahin sachai bhi he
 Sometimes it seems that the media is misusing its power
 'ped news' kii baat bhi uthaai ja rahi he
 It is also a question that is there corruption in the media as well? There is also a question about media coverage
 sawaal yah bhi uthta he ki kya media apni saamaajik jimmedaari se bhaag rahaa he? Social news is less visible nowadays in media
 saanp, bichchhu, bhoot-pret ke jariye darshakon ko lubhaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The leaders who have been questioning the media, nowadays their news is shown more by the media
 media kii pahunch kaa vistaar zarur hua he, lekin media gaanvon ke logon kii samasyaon se achoota najar aa rahaa he
 Whatever it is, it is probably not okay to weigh everyone in the same scales
 bahut-se aise samachar channel or akhbaar hai, jo apni eemaandaar reporting or vishleshanon se media kii chhavi acchhee banaae rakhane kii koshish karte hue samaaj ke vyapak hit ke liye kaam karte hai
 The comments aisa nahin he ki media koi acha kaam nahin karata
 The media has raised major scams in the country, many such news channels and newspapers are conscious of the problems of the society and they have also started some special campaigns
 ho saktaa he zyada na ho, lekin pichley kuch dinon main media ne kisaanon kii samasyaon ko bhi dikhaaya he
 In cases like the Nirbhaya incident, we saw the media in a new way
 uski sakriyata or mukharata kii vajah se hi nirbhaya cond par upja naagarik aakrosh jan-andolan kaa rup le sakaa or aakhirkaar yonhinsa virdohi kanoonon main sanshodhan hue
 There is also a flurry between the government and the media, but curbing the freedom of media is not a good thing
 khabar dikhaane ke liye media ko puri azaadi milani chahie
 The government or politicians have to understand the reality
 sirf apane phaayde ke liye media kaa istemaal karnaa or zarurat padane par media ke haq par hathaudaa maarna apane pairon par hi kulhadi maarane jaisaa hoga

 There is also a flurry between the government and the media, but curbing the freedom of media is not a good thing
 khabar dikhaane ke liye media ko puri azaadi milani chahie
 The government or politicians have to understand the reality
 sirf apane phaayde ke liye media kaa istemaal karnaa or zarurat padane par media ke haq par hathaudaa maarna apane pairon par hi kulhadi maarane jaisaa hoga
 i am not defending the media
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki media ke kaam karne ke tareeke or charitra main bahut badlaav aayaa he
 There is some truth in the questions raised on the media
 kabhi-kabhi aisa lagata he ki media apni takat kaa galat istemaal kar rahaa he
 Talk of 'paid news' is also being raised
 yah bhi sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya media main bhi bhrashtachar he? media ke kawarej ko lekar bhi sawaal uth rahaa he
 The question also arises whether the media is running away from its social responsibility? media main aajkal saamaajik khabaren kam dikhaai detii hai
 Attempts are being made to lure the audience through snakes, scorpions and ghosts
 jo netaa media par sawaal uthaate rahe hai, aajkal unki khabar media dwaara zyada dikhaai jaati hai
 The reach of the media has certainly expanded, but the media seems untouched by the problems of the people of the villages
 jo ho, har kisi ko ek hi taraazoo main taulnaa shaayad thik nahin he
 There are many news channels and newspapers, which work for the larger interest of society by trying to maintain the image of the media through their honest reporting and analysis
 tippaniyan It is not that the media does not do any good
 desh main hue bade-bade ghotaalon ko media ne hi uthaaya he, kai aise samachar channel or akhbaar samaaj kii samasyaon ke prati sachet hai or unhone kuch vishesh abhiyaan bhi shuru kiye hai
 It may not be much, but the media has also shown the problems of farmers in the last few days
 nirbhaya cond jaise maamalon main hamane media ko nae rup main dekha
 It was because of his activism and outspokenness that the civil outrage over the Nirbhaya incident took the form of a mass movement and finally the anti-sexual violence laws were amended
 sarkaar or media ke bich nokajhonk bhi hoti rahati he, lekin media kii azaadi par roak lagaana acchhee baat nahin
 Media must get complete freedom to show news
 sarkaar yaa rajanetaaon ko hakeekat samajni hogi
 Using the media only for your own benefit and hammering at the right of the media when needed will be like hitting an ax at your feet

 The media has raised major scams in the country, many such news channels and newspapers are conscious of the problems of the society and they have also started some special campaigns

 Sports Minister Rajyavardhan Rathore said that if the ICC is under the World anti-doping Agency (WADA) and it investigates its players, then the government has no problem
 rathore kaa yah bayaan wada ke die gaye bayaan ke baad aayaa he
 In its statement, Wada has denied the bcci's claim that the National Doping Agency (NADA) has no right to conduct dope investigations of the Board's cricket players, as the BCCI is under the National Sports Federation (NSF) Does not come and its existing anti-doping mechanism works under the WADA rules
 rathore ne kaha, 'hamaare liye teen log kaaphi ahm hai-khilaadi, coach or prashansak
 When doping occurs, fans are deceived, as fans treat players as their norm
 doping se prashansakon ke vishwaas ke saath dhokhaa hota he, isliye ghar khel sangh ke liye yah jaruri he ki wo is baat ko sunishchit kare kii khel main dhokhadhadi na ho
 "rathore said," Cricket is not untouched by this
 main is baat se khush hum ki cricket baahar kii agency se dope par niyantran rakh rahaa he, lekin jab puraa desh nadaa par bharosa kar rahaa he, to cricket khilaadiyon ko bhi is par bharosa karnaa chahie
 However, we have left everything on Wada as the ICC is under him
 'saal 2004 athens olympic main padak jeetne vaale rathore ne kaha ki agar khilaadiyon kii jaanch wada karata he, to mantralay ko kisi tarah kii pareshaani nahin he
 He said, "when the ICC is under WADA, it should follow its doping rules and it is up to the WADA to assure that cricket players have a dope test
" hamen is baar se koi shikaayat nahin he
 'there is a lot of dispute between the WADA and the BCCI at this time
 wada ko nadaa kii april kii audit report se pataa chalaa tha ki bisisiai nadaa kaa paalan nahin karata he or na hi vahacricketmen doping rodhi kaarykram ko maanata he
 According to the agency, the BCCI had categorically turned down Wada's demand for dope tests of Indian cricketers
 wada ke niyamon ke mutabik khilaadiyon ko har saal kii timahi main isisi ko dope test ke liye apni jagah or samay bataanaa hoga or unhen har din ek ghante ke liye uplabdh rahanaa hoga

 Asiya Andrabi, the head of separatist organization 'dukhtaran-e-millat' in Jammu and Kashmir, is celebrating Pakistan Day on Friday at an undisclosed location
 asia ne is baat kii jaankaree apane twitor acount se di
 He wrote, dukhtaran-e-millat celebrated Pakistan Day by organizing an event
 iske saath ek video bhi post kiya
 Let me tell, separatist leader Asiya Andrabi has often been making such controversial tweets
 isse pehle isi saal farvari main asia ne ek video twit kiya tha, jisamen pakistan ke aatanki sanghathan bhartiya sena ke bare main aapattijanak bayaan de rahe the
 Three armed masked men were seen in the video, who described themselves as members of the Kashmir Mujahideen
 unke mutabik, bhartiya sena hafiz said or masood ajahar ko maarane kaa khwab dekh rahi he
 Andrabi, who was arrested in December last year, was released in the last week of December last year after being kept in jail for two days
 unke saath unki saathi sophy fehamida ko bhi rihaai mili thi
 He was arrested from outside the court in December itself
 tab unki 2010 ke ek maamle main giraftaar hui thi
 Earlier, he was arrested in May last year for breaking the Public Safety Act
 jiske baad hoicourt ke aadesh par unhen central jail main shift kiya gaya tha
 The flag of Pakistan has also been waved before, 54-year-old Asiya is a separatist leader supporting Pakistan
 purv main pakistani jhanda laharaate hue asia kii tasviren saamne aa chuki hai
 Apart from this, Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the Mumbai attack, has also agreed to contact Asiya over phone at a rally

 Raj Thackeray has made a cartoon on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech in Rajya Sabha
 piem modi buudhvaar ko raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par dhanyavad prastaav main bol rahe the
 In this cartoon, Gandhi is seen explaining something to PM Narendra Modi
 is cartoon main patel or nehru bhi dikhaai de rahe hai jo gandhi ke peeche baithe hue hai
 Modi mentioned these three leaders in his speech
 modi ne kaha tha ki 'congress mukt bhaashan' unki nahin gandhi kii soch thi, kyonki aazaadee milane ke baad unhone kaha tha ki ab congress kaa astitv nahin rahanaa chahie
 After this, Modi accused the Congress of making Jawaharlal Nehru the PM by not making Sarkar Patel the PM
 thakare kaa cartoon isi par he
 In the cartoon, Mahatma Gandhi is seen explaining to PM Modi that Nehru was made the PM only at his behest
 cartoon marathi bhashaa main he, jisamen gandhi modi se kah rahe hai- are betaa narendra main tumhen do baaten bataata hum
 First thing - i did not make Jawaharlal Nehru the PM
 tumhen is par kuch kahana he? duusari baat- agar sardaar patel desh ke grih mantri the to bhi vah congress ke hi netaa the
 Why are you making a statue of Patel by not making Hedgewar and Golwalkar idols? You are a Sangh pracharak, right? Bharatiya Janata Party President Amit Shah is also seen behind PM Modi in the cartoon, who is seen hiding
 aise main nagaland sarkaar banane ko lekar sabhi tarah ke vikalp khule hone kii baat kahi ja rahi he

 On one hand, sharp opposition of the opposition is going on in the conversion of Parliament, on the other hand three Yadav leaders are busy in Mahadharna and Mahavilaya in the process of overthrowing the Central Government
 dotarafa hamale se sarkaar hili to nahin he lekin iske netaaon ke maathe par bal jarur pad gaye hai
 Not allowing Parliament to run is a part of the opposition's strategy and the government believes that the trick behind it is to prevent the passage of important bills
 sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr kaa bada hissaa to vipaksh ke shorsharabe main nikal gaya he, ab bache-khuche samay main sarkaar kaise bilon ko paas karavaaegi, yah dekhnaa he
 But even more interesting is the preparations for the Mahadharna and Mahavillayas at Jantar Mantar by the leaders of the six parties
 bihar main chunaav ke maddenzar nitish kumaar or lalu prasad kii party ke vilay kii sambhaavnaaen bad gai hai, yah baat alag he ki aisa karke nitish kumaar raajnneetik harakiri kar lenge
 Bihar had chosen him as a good governance man against the misrule of Lalu Prasad and he lived up to the expectations of the public but due to personal differences with Narendra Modi, he chose a different path
 ab ek kadam aage jaakar vah apni party ko apane prabal virdohi lalu prasad ko saunpna chaahate hai
 Those who know the working style of Laloo Prasad know how they work and their power of demolition
 bihar main lalub koi takat nahin rah gaye hai, haa, vah apni jati ke sabase bade netaa jarur hai
 By adding the percentage of votes of both the parties, Lalu is assuming that if both are together, Bihar's chair can be captured again
 zaahir he unhone puri takat laga di he
 By deciding to marry his younger daughter to the grandson of SP supremo Mulayam Singh's brother, he also wants to strengthen his relations with her
 is rishtedaari ke baad vah desh kii raajnneeti main ek takat banane kii ummid bhi rakhte hai
 Lalu is well aware that Mulayam Singh will always have a presence here due to UP being adjacent to Delhi and he will be able to raise his voice in Delhi under his umbrella
 darasal yah mahadharana or mahavilay ek raajnneetik mishan kii bajaay raajnneetik mahatvakankshaon kii dastak he
 Devgowda, which has become almost zero in the politics of Karnataka, and Chautala have become clear in Haryana, there is no political force
 na to inke paas jan samarthan he or na hi inkaa koi bhavishya dikhataa he
 These parties are fine for making noise but without mass support
 loksabhaa chunaavamein buree tarah parajeet ye partiyaan abhi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main rode to atka sakati hai lekin chunaav main ye kya kar paaengi, yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga
 However, we have an interesting political scene in front of which the characters are past artists who are trying to become the stars of the future
 lekin samasya yah he ki unke paas nayaa kuch nahin he, to phir aaie ise dekhen or samay ke badlaav kaa intazaar karen
 On the Rafale deal between India and France, French President Emmanuel Macron has said that the French government will not oppose if India wants to cover some nuances of the deal for any kind of debate with the opposition

 deal par barti ja rahi gopniyata par maikron ne kaha ki donon deshon ke bich jab kisi maamle par behad sensitive bijness interest shaamil rahete hai to khulaase karnaa uchit nahin rahata
 Macron said that the companies competing under the commercial agreement in this deal should not be aware of the specifics of the deal
 yah commercial agreement kuch companiyon ke hiton se jude hai lihaaja inpar gopneeyata jaij he
 Read this: Jaitley said on Rafael, meet Pranab before raising questions rahulmacron said that the secret on some technical issues is only due to the commercial agreement
 maikron ne daawa kiya ki yadi bharat main modi sarkaar is deal par uth rahe vivaadon ke bich vipaksh ke saath samvaad main kuch baarikiyon par se pardaa uthaanaa chaahati he to unki sarkaar ko isamen koi aapatti nahin hogi
 On this defense agreement between India and France, Macron said that the deal was done in a good negotiation environment
 iske saath hi yah deal bharat kii suraksha ke liye behad ahm
 According to Macron, the Rafale Deal is a part of the larger agreement between India and France

 Trying to prove the critics wrong, Suresh Raina said that he is made for Test cricket and is working on playing the short ball better
 raina ne kaha, ‘main jaanata hum ki main test cricket ke liye bana hum
 i have done well in Tests
 main pichley saal westeindies main acha khelaa tha
 The first Test against England was also good for me
 main kadi mehnat kar rahaa hum
 He said, "it is difficult to bat at number six or seven
" isliye main sunishchit karuunga ki jab bhi mujhe mauka mili main sabit karun ki main acha test khilaadi banane kii kshamta rakhata hum
 Asked by Raina that he is considered a limited overs player, he said, "people call me an ODI player, but let them speak
 main jaanata hum ki mere paas samay he
 i have been out against spinners eight or nine times in Tests and i am working on it
 maine bharat ke liye tii-20 or vanade jite hai, lekin test main mujhe aisa mauka nahin mila he
 ' "don’t go to Kochi, come back
 We make you a minister and help you in whatever way you want
 " This audio recording of @BSYBJP trying to lure Congress MLA goes on to prove, that Yeddyurappa is working hard to live up to his reputation of being corrupt and devoid of ethics
