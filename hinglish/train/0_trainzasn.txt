 bihar ke mujffarpur zile main acute enciflitis ke kaaran 100 se adhik bacchon kii maut hui he
 In 2014 too, 139 children died
 2012 main 178 bacchon kii maut ho gai thi
 No such year passes when there is no news of the death of children between April and June
 bhavuk hone ke liye media 2012 main bhi bhavuk hua hoga, 2014 main bhi hua hoga or 2019 main bhi ho hi rahaa he
 The reasons related to death in Muzaffarpur district is such a matter that if 100 children are not killed, then your media should not show even thirty seconds of news on it
 media hi nahin aap bhi nahin dekhnaa chahenge
 It is obvious that you also would not like to see the discussion on malnutrition at 9 o'clock at night because you believe that it should be shown to show that something is happening
 kuposhan vagairah to chalata hi rahata he
 Also remember when you saw the campaign time discussion in the news channel about malnutrition and poverty
 agar koi kare to kya aap dekhnaa chahenge, agar koi is sawaal ko lekar dibet kare ki falaan beemaari ko rokane ke liye tikaakaran thik se chal rahaa he yaa nahin to kya aap dekhenge
 Perhaps many viewers will change channels
 fasebuk se lekar channelon main zyaadaatar log pareshaan is baat se hai ki koi kuch bol kyon nahin rahaa he
 We are looking for a crowd of passionate people
 jab vah bheed nahin banati he to uttejnaa shant hone lagati he tab ham aakhri koshish karne lagate hai
 Starts talking
 naam lekar ek duusare ko pukaarane lagate hai
 Where is the Chief Minister, where is the Prime Minister
 sarkaar kahaan he
 Those watching the cricket match start cursing
 sach yahi he ki kisi ko fark nahin padataa he
 We have all seen such disarray many times
 samasya vahiin kii vahiin hai
 The system is like that
 aadha adhuraa
 Now the society of the audience has come to this level, he wants a debate on any issue
 yah uski antim khwaahish ho gai he
 Debate
 jaise meley main bhaisa yaa bheda ladaate hai, vaise dibet karaiye
 i am saying all these things in my criticism as well
 kulamilaakar bhavukta bhari reporting main aap dard ke ahsaas se rou-ba-rou to ho jate hai magar turant aap use bhul bhi jate hai
 That is why you forgot that in 2014, 139 children died
 tabhi aapako yaad nahin aayaa ki dow
 Harshvardhan went to this hospital in 2014, also in 2019
 2014 main 20 se 22 june tak dow
 Harshvardhan lived in Muzaffarpur
 is daure ke bare main 2014 main dow
 Harshvardhan has written in detail on Facebook which still exists
 uske kuch dinon baad ve swasthya mantri pad se hataa die gaye or unki jagah je pi nadda aa gaye
 The question should be asked what the Health Ministry of the Central Government has done about Muzaffarpur in these five years
 un ghoshnaaon par kyon nahin amal kiya jo kai staron kii baithkon ke baad kiye gaye the
 In 2014, Harsh Vardhan said that 100% vaccination should be done
 koi baccha tikaakaran se nahin chhotna chahie
 Soon a 100-bed children's hospital will be built here
 paanch saal baad vahi harshavardhan jab dobaaraa swasthya mantri bane hai to vahi sab doharaa rahe hai
 a 100-bed children's hospital will be built for 100 crores
 us vakt dow
 Harshvardhan had announced that Virologic Dynogetic Lab will be set up in Gaya, Bhagalpur, Bettiah, Pavapuri and Nalanda
 mujffapur or darbhanga main do ucch stareey research centre banaae jaaenge
 Not only this, the seats of medical colleges will be increased from 150 to 250
 yaad rakhiegaa june 2014 main 139 bacchon kii maut hui thi
 Five years later Dr
 harshavardhan yahi sab kah rahe hai, lab banegaa, aspataal banegaa
 Had the decision of these meetings been implemented five years ago, 100 children would not have died
 2014 kii baat 2019 main bhi kehani pad rahi he
 The Center's Health Ministry should be asked what steps were taken on the announcement made by the Health Minister in 2014
 koi kadam kyon nahin uthaae gaye
 If there is no role of the Union Minister in this, then why do they announce after visiting
 kya unhone media main hi elaan kiya tha, aisa to lagata nahin
 Then who will answer why in five years Virological labs have not been established in Bihar
 muzaffarpur main 100 bistaron vaala aspataal kyon nahin bana
 If the Center forgot what the state government was doing
 2015 se 17 ke bich bhi is jile main mautein hoti raheen bhale hi sankhya 50 se kam thi
 What was the Health Minister of Bihar doing
 bihar ke mukhyamantri kya kar rahe the
 Did not go there for a month but did for the poor children of Muzaffarpur while staying in Patna
 muzaffapur kii janata ne apane liye kya kiya
 Ever asked anyone
 bihar sarkaar bataa sakati he ki 2014 main 139 bacchon kii maut ke baad use teen saal kaa vakt mila tha, usne kya kiya
 What did the Bihar government do to prevent the deaths of 100 children
 dow harshavardhan bihar main paanch vishaanu jaanch centre banane kii baat kar rahe he
 First of all, let us tell you how many staff are there in such organizations of Central Government
 neshnal centre for dizij control jaisi sanstha main paryaapt staff he
 We checked its website
 dilli se lekar bharat ke duusare shaharon main kul 9 branch hai
 In all these branches, the total number of employees of scientists and officers of every level combined in the branches is 434
 bharat kii aabaadi he ek arab se adhik
 How many epidemics spread
 is hisaab se yah sankhya kitni kam he
 Its budget is also only 233 crores
 yah sab jaankaree encidisi kii website se lee he
 Now let's talk about the CDC, the world's most prestigious body fighting the epidemics
 sidisi yani centre for dizil control
 Are in Atlanta, USA
 iskaa bajet sunakar hi aap behosh ho jaaenge
 11 for the budget 2018 of this single institution
 1 billian america dollar he
 77,000 crores in Indian rupees
 bharat ke swasthya bajet se bhi zyada he ek centre kaa bajet
 India's health budget is 52 thousand crores
 ab aapako samaj aa jayega ki ham mahamariyon se ladane ke naam par chooney or fitkaree kaa chhidkaav hi kar pate hai, yahi bahut he
 The National Center for Disease Control, an institution of India, would not even have 500 employees but the Atlanta CDC employs more than 10,000 people
 jinamein se 2 pratishat log duniya ke alag-alag deshon main kaam karte hai
 The rest work in the US
 sidisi main kaam karne vaale paanch hazaar se zyada logon ke paas masters or doctor kii degree hai
 Therefore, said that Hindi journalism should now avoid emotional gimmick
 vaastaviktaa par aa janaa chahie
 We fight for the headline in the media in the name of fighting the epidemic
 mantri kaa daura ho gaya
 Announcement has been made
 feeta cat gaya
 Newspaper pages were filled and the public became fools
 main muzaffarpur main 100 bacchon kii maut se dur nahin gaya hum
 You may think that i am telling all these boring things
 bani or vrinda ne kaaphi mehnat kii he in jaankariyon ko jutaney main
 When Sushil Bahuguna visited the website named Research Gate, many research papers have been written on the causes and remedies in this case, which have been presented in international forums
 aap bhi research get par jaakar is mahamari se sambandhit research paper pard sakate hai
 Doctors in India have done well despite limited resources
 sab kuch bataaya he magar system ne is par amal kiya hota to 100 bacchon kii jaan nahin jaati
 Are the results of such research done with great effort only to keep it pressed in the files
 research sirf research kar sakate hai
 It is the responsibility of the Health Department to implement it whether it is the Central Government or the State Government
 darasal hamaari adhiktar afasarshahi ko apane vaigyanikon or researchrs ke kaam kii qeemat kaa andaaza hi nahin he
 They do not consider it necessary to read or understand their recommendations as normal
 phir kaise bihar ke up mukhyamantri susheel modi ne twit kar diya ki is beemaari kaa ilaaj nahin he
 He tweeted that America does not even have treatment
 privansion yani rokthaam bhi ilaaj mana jaataa he, is baat ko koun kise samajha degaa
 It is better than working that you spend many hours of the day in whatsapp
 pataa bhi nahin chalegaa ki aapako kuch pataa nahin chal rahaa he
 i want to tell you one more thing
 mahamariyaan jab failein to kaarnon kaa pataa lagane, sakshya jutaney, research karne, rokane ke upaay bataane ke liye atlanta ke sidisi main ek pad hota he
 Of Epidemic Intelligence Officer
 jab hamaare mitra doctor ne yah baat bataai tabhi dhyaan gaya ki dekha jaae ki ham bharat main aisi mahamariyon ke liye kya kar rahe hai
 However, Dr
 Harsh Vardhan should know the status of these institutions of his ministry and tweet to the media on his own behalf and tell him how much budget is there, how much staff is there and what is the condition
 mantri khud bataa den kyonki media main khaskar news channelon main aise boring vishyon kii reporting nahin hoti he
 Only when 100 children die
 mujffapur ke shri krishna medical kalege aspataal main jahaan 100 se adhik bacchon kii maut hui he vahaan 50 bistaron kii ai si you he
 The capacity of this hospital has increased in five years
 aap in tasveeron ko dekhakar bhavuk na hon
 The same situation is with most government hospitals
 dilli kaa twitor class agar apane bacchon ko zamin par baitha dekh legaa to india shem-shem karne lagegaa
 The Hindi class dies silently and remains proud of India even after it dies
 ye antar he
 Alam is that Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi has issued a statement that in the meeting before the budget, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will ask for the budget for this
 zaahir he rajya sarkaar ne apni taraf se kuch khaas nahin kiya hoga yaa uske paas paisa nahin hoga
 Now the Union Health Minister is talking about setting up a 10-bed ICU in a year in the Primary Health Center
 yani 160 bistaron kii isiu
 In the same month in 2020, they will investigate this claim
 hamaare sahyogi manish kumaar ke anusaar muzaffarpur main 16 primary health centre hai
 Talking to Manish, Civil Surgeon Shailesh Prasad Singh said that two-bed icus have been made in the Primary Health Center, so why are all the patients coming to Muzaffarpur
 kya jo mariz yahaan aa rahe hai unhen in primary health centre par guideline ke hisaab se upachaar mila he
 Not only this, vaccination could also be 76%
 100 fisadi nahin hua
 Give one more data
 neshnal sample survey ke anusaar bihar main 3000 primary health centre hone chahie, par hai maatr 1883
 This is so lacking
 kya ye thik hoga
 You will get the answer to this question when you send a good morning message on whatsapp to hundred people throughout the year
 bharat main public health par kaam karne vaale kai doctor is vishay par shodh kar rahe hai
 Those were the most off-record conversations
 kaiyon ke research paper padhe
 Which are also available for you on the Internet
 unhen padhane ke baad yahi laga ki bihar ke 100 bacchon kii maut nahin hui, unki hatya hui he
 If the system was prompt, the children would not have died in poor families
 kya garibi ek kaaran he? bilkul he
 That is why the system is loose when it is poor
 garib hai tabhi to inke bachche kuposhan ke shikaar hai
 That is when he died
 ab aapane suna ki lichi khaane se maut hui he
 Many people laughed
 unhone sahi kiya
 They are coming as soon as they laugh
 rone se to koi phayda bhi nahin
 The medical journal is the Lancet
 duniya main isaki apni pratishtha he
 For this, a research paper was written by Arun Shah and t Jacob John which was published on 31 March 2017
 donon 2012 main bihar gaye the jab 178 bacchon kii kii maut ho gai thi
 The paper by Jacob John and Arun Shah states that the death in Muzaffarpur is related to lychee
 garibi se he or kuposhan se he
 When he saw the record in 2012, it was found that most children have seizures between 6 am and 7 am
 daure padane kaa matlab saadhaaran jubaan main yah hua ki bacchon kaa dimag sunn hone laga
 It happens that litchi is broken at 4 in the morning
 todane vaale garib mazdoor hote hai
 It is eaten less at night
 khaali pet maa baap or bachche pahunch jate hai or lichi todate vakt kha lete hai
 When a weak-bodied and empty-stomach child eats litchi, he becomes vulnerable to acute encephalitis
 vaise ise ancifallopathy bolte hai
 The term is used for mental illness
 dhyaan rakhie ki falitis or pathy main antar hota he
 Lychee contains an element that stops the formation of glucose in an empty body with malnutrition
 glucose band hote hi dimag kaam karnaa band kar detaa he or tezi se brain ke baad liver par asar hota he
 The child dies research main yah sujhaayaa gaya he ki agar bachche ko turant hi glucose diya jaae to use bachaaya ja saktaa he
 Giving glucose starts producing insulin in the body and activates the glucose-making elements in the brain
 yah baat public main he
 This litchi will be nothing when any healthy body eats it
 ham aap khaaenge to kuch nahin hoga
 But if the child is suffering from malnutrition, it can be fatal for him
 bihar ke kashish news channel ke samvaadadaataaon ne muzaffarpur ke aspataal main is vakt bhartee marizon or doctoron se lichi ko lekar sawaal poocha
 So it turned out that 88 out of 100 people believed that the child ate litchi
 april, may, june ke samay kaa sambandh lichi se he or inkaa sambandh garibi, kuposhan se he
 According to the National Family Health Survey conducted in 2015-16, 44% of 5-year-old children in Bihar are malnourished
 aap soch sakate hai ki kitni garibi he
 India's national average is 36 percent
 duniya main sabase adhik kuposhan ke shikaar log bharat main rahete he
 We rank 103 among 117 countries
 to lichi main kharabi nahin he kharabi he bihar kii garibi main, uske system main
 In their research, Arun Shah and t Jacob had reported that children who died in 2012 succumbed to encephalitis due to food best toxins
 lakhanu ke dow mukul das ne bataaya ki lichi kaaran ho saktaa he kyonki jamaica main bhi lichi kii tarah kaa ek fal he jisamen is tarah ke lakshan dekhe gaye hai
 Perhaps that is why the Jamaican newspaper Zamakan Observer has also published a report on the death of litchi in Muzaffarpur
 indipented akhbaar se hamen 2014 kii ek report mili jisamen jamaica or mujffarpur main hui maut ke bich ek samanta pai gai he
 There is a litchi-like crop called ackee, which spread acute ankylopathic disease
 eki or lichi main ek hi tarah kaa toxic paaya jaataa he
 Eat-and-drink children in both places had no effect of this fruit
 urisa or saharanpur main bhi khaane main zahreele tatv hone ke kaaran is tarah kii maut kii ghatana ho chuki he
 In 2016, more than 100 children died in Malkangiri, Odisha
 vahaan bhi dekha gaya ki ek khaas tarah ke paudhe ke beej khaane se brain main glucose kaa bananaa band hua or bachche marane lage
 Awareness was spread there and now there is no such information from there
 tii jacob jon ne saharanpur enciflitis kaa naam diya he
 That is, his reasons and character were different
 mujffarpur enciflitis kaa naam diya he kyonki yahaan kaaran lichi he
 These scientists had also advised the Health Ministry of Bihar what to do at such a time
 kya un par kadam uthaaya gaya, uthaaya gaya hota to 100 se adhik bacchon kii maut kyon hoti
 t Jacob John has written in one of his research papers
 healthcare main jaanch ke galat nattejey yaa ilaaj ke galat tareeke ko chikitsa main laaparvaahee mana jaataa he
 Public health means mismanagement in public health is considered negligent
 iske kaaran jo maut hoti he use hatya samajha janaa chahie
 State government officials believe that it is the responsibility of the central government to investigate the epidemic
 dilli main mana jaataa he ki swasthya rajya kaa vishay he
 The job of the state is to investigate and prevent disease
 durbhaagya yah he ki iske shikaar log hote hai
 Their voice is nowhere
 main yah sab isliye nahin bataa rahaa ki sarkaar yaa system yaa samaaj shame kare
 i know after two to four days everything will be normal
 ek tarika yah ho saktaa he ki sabhi lichi bagan main bihar sarkaar ek board laga de yaa board lagaana anivaary kara de ki subah ke vakt lichi todane aae bacchon ko khaali pet khaane se manaa karen
 Explain to their family
 doosraa sarkaar kuposhan dur karne kaa kaam kare
 India is about to become a world guru, the eyes of these children sitting in the class room of the world guru on an empty stomach will remain on Lychee, who will be waiting for their death
 sochie bihar ke sau bacchon ko khadaa karenge to 44 bachche aapako kuposhan ke shikaar milenge
 What would you like? It is okay that elections do not take place on these issues, but where have the people said that after the elections it should be killed for this reason
 doctoron par dabaav rahata he
 At such a time, he will talk about the government
 unhen bhi pataa he ki paryaapt system nahin he
 Where are the employees and who is there for awareness? The kind of children who have died in economically weaker sections will have to spread awareness from house to house
 bataanaa hoga ki khaali pet lichi na khaaen
 The scope of mid day mill and anganwadi will have to be increased
 kuposhan kaa hona bataa rahaa he ki donon yojanaayen fail hai
 Only then the children who died in Sri Krishna Hospital have come from Purvi Champaran
 samastipur se aae hai
 Has come from Begusarai
 muzaffarpur se to aae hi hai
 If patients from four districts reach a hospital, then think about the condition of the health system
 nidhi, shahanaz, asmin khatun, shalwani kumari, suganti kumari, samarine parveen, khushi kumari, shitanshu kumari, nitu kumari, anisha kumari, shankar kumaar, indal kumaar, prahlaad kumaar, vitu kumari, suhaani khatun, priti kumari, gunjan, nisha kumari, anoushka kumari, tarannum, sanjit kumaar, vikaas kumaar, vikrant kumaar, sabista parveen, sanni kumaar, alok kumaar, gonaur kumaar, nidhi kumari, sita kumari, muskaan kumari, sonaali khatun, sahida khatun, anjili kumari, swati, jyoti kumari, chandani kumari, sonu kumaar, aayush kumaar, gunjaa kumari, raja babu, kahani kumaar, gudiya, ravina kumari, farzaana khatun, ham sabakaa naam nahin le sakate hai
 i wish i could name everyone
 system kii laaparvaahee se inaki hatya hui he hamane in sabakaa naam sankhya main samet diya he
 Now these names will never be able to be called
 kuch ke hi sahi, pukaar kar dekhnaa chahie shaayad kisi ko fark pade
 Virus is not the cause of what has happened in Muzaffarpur
 lichi kii sambhaavna zyaada he
 The Japanese fever virus comes to the human body through mosquitoes
 barish ke dinon main
 Where paddy is cultivated
 jahaan videshon se pakshi aate hai
 They bring viruses with them
 yah alag beemaari he
 It is also called encephalitis
 iskaa samaadhaan he
 Not after illness, but before it happens
 agar tikaakaran ho jaae to japani bukhaar nahin failata he
 So you should check whether the government has got the Japanese fever vaccinated in your area? Attack of this type of disease occurs after a gap of two years
 ham jab tak system ko majboot nahin karenge, aspataalon ko thik nahin karenge or abhiyaanon ko prabhavi nahin banaaenge 100-100 karke bachche marate jaaenge
 If you want to in Muzaffarpur, the government can stop the death from this disease
 ek sawaal uth rahaa he ki bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar mujffarpur kyon nahin ja rahe hai? mukhyamantri nahin jaakar bilkul thik kar rahe hai kyonki isi sawaal ke dam par media main yah story zindaa to he
 Otherwise, everyone will lose interest in its coverage after he leaves
 sara jor isi par he ki mantri log ja kyon nahin rahe hai? sawaal ek or he
 What will happen with the departure of the Chief Minister? Will there be a qualitative improvement in the health system of Bihar? PRS i

policy Research Studies has analyzed the health budget of Bihar for 2018-19
 media report kii khaak chaanane se or bhi kai jaankariyaan mili hai
 Bihar 4 of its budget
 4 pratishat hi swasthya par kharch karata he
 This is much less than the average expenditure of 18 states
 bihar main 17,685 logon par ek doctor he
 The national average is one doctor at 11,097 people
 yah jaankaree bihar ke swasthya mantri ne 2018 main vidhansabha main di thi
 Do not ask the name of the Health Minister if you want to understand the health system of Bihar
 bas ganga pul par khadey ho jaaiye
 Khatara cars carry patients from all over Bihar in the name of ambulances and bring them to private hospitals in Patna
 apana kamishan lekar laut jaati hai
 i want to tell you about this ambulance but not today
 aajkal aapane dekha hoga ki sarkarein kuch nahin kar paatin to ambulance gaadiyaan laanch kar detii hai
 The minister shows the flag and leaves
 kuch saal ke baad jarur puuchhie ki ye gaadiyaan jo ravaanaa hui hai, jaati kis aspataal main hai, jaati hai to kya vahaan doctor bhi hote hai
 Why has private ambulance become a business? Obviously the hospital is not there
 100 bacchon kii maut hui he
 Nobody is responsible

 input :IANS After the Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh assembly elections, the Congress and BJP have a fight in Karnataka
 gujarat or karnataka kii chunavi siyasat main yun to bada fark he or ateet main congress kaa palada hi baari rahaa he, baavjood iske desh kii sabase puraani party gujarat kii tarj par hi yahaan bhi apni chhavi ke vipareet ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 However, Congress does not seem to be in a position to ignore Muslims by raising the slogan of Hindutva in Karnataka and it is also visible
 bhale hi ek taraf congress netaa or karnataka ke siem ke
 Siddaramaiah, along with the Congress, himself is showing the true symbol of Hindutva, but he is not losing any opportunity to practice Muslims
 haal main siddharmaiya ne apane twitor acount par kuch tasviren share kii hai
 These photos uploaded on 25 December are of a tomb
 jahaan siem siddharmaiya mannath maangate dikhaai de rahe hai
 Not only this, he is also wearing a hat
 darasal, siddharmaiya gadad jile ke lakshmeshwar gaye the
 Here he asked for a vow by folding his hands at the shrine of Hazrat Sayyid Suleiman Badshah
 saath hi chini seva bhi kii
 On the other hand, if we look at the statements of Siddaramaiah, he is constantly criticizing the RSS and BJP
 yahaan tak ki isi maheene wo ye bhi kah chuke hai ki bijepi or aresas main bhi ativaadee hai
 Also, he has compared BJP with Kauravas while referring to Mahabharata
 siyasat main ahm muslimdakshin bharat main kerala ke baad doosraa sabase zyada muslim aabaadi vaala muslim rajya he
 The state has around 14 per cent Muslim population
 uttar karnataka main muslimon kaa bahulya he
 Especially in areas like Gulbarga, Bidar, Bijapur, Raichur and Dharwad, Muslim votes play a decisive role
 rajya vidhansabha kii kul 224 siton main se kareeb 60 par muslim votaron kaa prabhaav mana jaataa he
 Dakshina Kannada, Dharwad, Gulbarga are the areas where more than 20 percent of Muslim voters are there
 khaas baat ye bhi he ki yahaan shahari kshetron main muslim zyada sankhya main hai
 Muslim population is around 21% in urban areas and around 8% in rural areas
 2013 vidhansabha kaa vot pratishat2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko 122 siten mili thim
 While the Janata Dal (secular) had 40 seats, BJP 40, KJP 6, Independents 9 and others 7 seats
 vot pratishtcongress- 36
 6% JDU (S) - 20
 2%bijepi- 19
 9% KJP- 9
 8%nirdaleey- 7
 4% other- 6
 1%muslimlambandmedia reports ke mutabik, hindutv ko lekar bayaanbaji se pehle hi muslim samudaay ke netaaon ne ek vishaal baithak kii thi
 In this, Muslims were appealed not to vote for parties like Owaisi's party AIMIM, Janata Dal (secular) and SDPI
 saath hi bijepi ke khilaaf congress ke saath ekajute hone kaa aahvaan kiya gaya tha
 This is the reason why Congress and Siddaramaiah are yet to ignore Muslims in Karnataka like Gujarat
 darasal, iske peeche ek vajah ye bhi ki gujarat main mukhya muqabla bijepi or congress ke bich tha
 Muslims had no choice but to go with the Congress
 jabaki karnataka main donon pramukh rashtriya dalon ke alaava jad (es) or kegepi bhi he
 In such a situation, from the issue of Tipu Sultan, now the Congress is trying to help both communities by claiming that the real Hindu and BJP are enemies of Hindutva
 agar aap pehali barpyar ke un haseen lamhon kaa lutflene ja rahe hai to samaj lijie ki yah utana aasaan nahin hone vaala he, jitna aap soch rahe hai
 However, for the first time, many types of fears are also associated with sex
 aapako samajhnaa hoga ki pehali baar sex ke dauraan kya karnaa chahie or usase bhi zyada jaruri yah he ki kya nahin karnaa chahie
 Everyone wants that everything should be right during sex for the first time and it should prove to be the horse of the long race
 man main kai tarah kii udhedbun ke saath rochak kahaniyaan bhi ubaal maarthi rahati hai
 Although there is no harm in this, but it is also important to understand that in the first time it may not be all that you have in mind
 aadmi chahta he ki pehali baar ke wo hasinpyar bhare lamhengitani zyada der tak ho saken chalem
 But if the orgasm happens quickly, there is no need to panic at all
 pehali baar main kai logon ke saath to uttejit hone ko lekar hi samasya saamne aa jaati he, lekin is sabase pareshaan naa hon
 After this, if you are in frustration then you are wrong
 agar pehali baar main vaisaa kuch nahin hua, jaisaa aap soch rahe the to jaan len ki doosraa mauka hameshaa aapke paas rahegaa
 Those moments of love can be painful for women for the first time, but do not panic
 asal main ye dard nahin unka dar he
 In most cases the pain is just like biting a chinkoti
 sirf dard kaa dar hi un haseen lamhon ko barbaad kar saktaa he
 Due to this fear, women start to panic even from mere touch
 aise samay main unke partner kii jimmedaari kaaphi bad jaati he
 At such a time, assure the woman that you are with her
 pyaar ke un haseen lamhon kaa bharpoor or aaramdaayak lutf lene ke liye paryaapt forple kaa sahaara jarur len
 Initially finger and then proceed towards the intercourse
 dhimi gati or sanyam hi safalataa kii kunjee he
 The most confusing thing about sex for the first time is that for the first time, it is necessary for a woman to have bleeding
 jabaki aisa nahin he
 Due to modesty breach, blood comes and we also need to understand that defecation, cycling, exercise, etc
 can be broken due to many other reasons
 kai maamalon main to yah janm se hi nahin hoti he
 Masturbation of women can also lead to defloration
 bleeding ho yaa naa ho, jab aap apane partner ke paas he to aapako usamen vishwaas jataana or karnaa hoga
 If there is any doubt, instead of taking it to the bedroom, it should be resolved beforehand

 Dalhousie Road will become history, new name will be 'dara Shikoh Road'
 ji haa aurangzeb road or res course road kii tarah ab dilli ke dalhauzi road kaa naam badal gaya he
 Dalhousie Road under NDMC in South Block of New Delhi area will be renamed as 'dara Shikoh' Road
 endiemasi ne somvaar ko hui council kii baithak main is nae naam ko manjuuri de di he
 Soon the NDMC will issue notifications for the new name
 darasal nai dilli se bijepi saansad or endiemasi sadsy minakshi lekhi ne dalhauzi road kaa naam badalakar daara shikoh road karne kaa prastaav rakhaa tha
 Which NDMC passed in the council meeting
 aap netaaon ne lagaaya bijepi par namakaran kii raajnneeti karne kaa aropek ke baad ek sadakon ke naam badalane kii siyasat par aam aadmi party ne sawaal uthaaye hai
 According to NDMC member and AAP MLA from Delhi Cantt, Commando Surendra, the BJP sitting at the center is politicizing the NDMC
 commando surendra ne 'daara shikoh' naam par aapatti jataate hue kaha ki jab aurangzeb road kaa naam badla gaya to phir mogul parivaar ke hi duusare sadsy kaa naam rakhane kii jaldi bijepi ko kyon he
 According to Commando Surendra, the BJP, which has accepted defeat in Punjab and Goa, wants to cross the Naiya of UP with the help of Mughals
 darasal commando surendra dalhauzi road kaa naam maharaja surajmal ke naam par rakhane kaa prastaav diya tha
 Lekhi gave the clarification: BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi rejected the allegations of naming politics and said that "even when the name of Aurangzeb Road was being changed, there was talk of naming Dara Shikoh
 lekin tab purv raashtrapati apije abdul kalam kii mrityu hone kii vajah se unhen sammaan dete hue apije abdul kalam road naam rakhaa gaya
 Dara Shikoh was the elder son of the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan, who promoted hindu-muslim unity
 daara shikoh sauhardra, bhaichaare or kala ke dhani the, ham sab unke rini hai
 There was a long-standing effort to honor him
 isiilie unke naam ko chunaa gaya
 "raja Surajmal was not done because according to the law, once a road or colony is named after him, he cannot be renamed after it
 ham sab raja surajmal kaa sammaan karte hai lekin purvi dilli main unke naam par pehle se hi surajmal vihaar he
 That is why they cannot be named
 satyendra jain ne bhi saadhaa nishanaap ke mantri satyendra jain ne bhi sadakon ke naam badalane ko upi chunaav ke maddenjar namakaran kii raajnneeti qaraar diya
 So Lekhi, while backing the Aam Aadmi Party, said that the politics that i want to do on this, avoid it
 aam aadmi party dilli kii chintaa kahaan he
 He is busy in Punjab and Goa
 isiilie dharm or jati ke naam par logon ko baantne kii koshish na karen
 Let us tell you that before Dalhousie Road, the name of Race Course Road has been changed to Lok Kalyan Marg and Aurangzeb Road to Dr
 APJ Abdul Kalam Road
 naam badalanaa matlab itihaas se chhedchhadraaston ke naam badalane par itihaaskaar kya sochate hai ajtak ne is mudde par baat kii dilli ke pramukh itihaaskaar firoz bakht ahamed se
 According to him, "changing the name means tampering with history, there should not be such an attempt, everyone's name must have been of some importance
 dalhousie angrezon ke afasar the, himachal main unke naam par bahut chije hai
 Darashikoh was considered a secular brother of Aurangzeb
 mujhe in sabake peeche raajnneeti kii bu aati he
 Keep politics away from it

 In Himachal, the BJP is raking up disproportionate assets and money laundering cases against the incumbent Congress CM Virbhadra Singh, while demonetisation, GST and the deteriorating economy of the country are being raised as issues by the Congress
 (input agenciyon se bhi) a statement by Congress leader Jyotiradityasindia before Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections has created a ruckus
 darasal, sindhiya ne ishaaron main hi khud ko rajya ke siem pad kaa ummidavaar bataa diya he
 During an election meeting in Dindori, he said, "I have jumped into the battle of war"
 aapke saamne do tarah ke netaa hai
 a leader is one who belongs to the Scindia family tradition
 jo 'jaan jaae par vachan naa jaae' kii baat karte hai
 At the same time, there is another leader Shivraj Singhji, who says that the word will go but does not know
 " jaahir he sindhiya ne is bayaan ke jariye khud ko shivaraj singh ke vikalp ke taur par sabake saamne rakhaa he
 Kamal Nath reacted to the statement of Sindhia, senior Congress leader Malnath has also got a response
 unhone kaha ki mukhyamantri pad kaa naam central cameti hi tay karti he
 In Bhopal, Kamal Nath said, "I do not know what Jyotiraditya has said but it is true that on one side there is a lie, on the other side there is truth
" logon se vinati he ki sachai kaa saath den
 He further said that any candidate is declared after the Central Committee meeting
 vahiin sindhiya ke bayaan parabijepine chutki lete hue kaha ki vah khud munh minya mitthu ban rahe hai
 Cooperative Minister of Madhya Pradesh Vishwas Sarang said that Scindia herself has started speaking that i am a contender for the Chief Minister
 ye vahi kahawat he ki meri mausi ko moonche hongi to main unhen mamaa kahuunga
 This is the result of factionalism and frustration of the Congress
 bataa den ki india today group ke political stock exange kaarykram main bhi shivaraj ke baad jyotiraditya sindhiya hi siem ke chehre ke liye sabase zyada pasand hai
 Reacting to a Pakistani court's dismissal of a report submitted by a judicial commission on the Mumbai terror attack on Tuesday, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) questioned whether the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack should be brought to justice But the government of Pakistan is also serious
 bhaajapa pravaktaa nirmala sitaraman ne samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha, "hamen jaankaree mili he ki pakistan kii ek adaalat ne mumbai aatankwaadi hamale par ek nyaayik ayog dwaara saunpi gai rapat ko mangalvaar ko khaarij kar diya he or use avaidh qaraar diya he
 " unhone kaha, "adaalat ne apane faisle main yah bhi kaha he ki sunwaayee ke dauraan is report ko saboot bhi nahin mana jayega

 The court said that the report of the commission cannot be made part of the documents related to the accused people in Pakistan
 nyaayalay ne nyaayik ayog ke kaam ko samay kii barbaadi bataaya
 Speaking to reporters, BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said, "we have come to know that a court in Pakistan has rejected the report submitted by a judicial commission on the Mumbai terror attack and declared it illegal
" " He said, "the court has also stated in its judgment that this report will not be considered evidence during the hearing
 kya mumbai hamale se jude maamalon ko lekar pakistan kii sarkaar gambheer bhi he!" Sitharaman, however, also clarified that she is not reacting to the decision of the Pakistani court

 a post shared by Raai Laxmi (@iamraailaxmi) on Nov 18, 2017 at 4:30am PST Let us tell you that Tashfeen, the southern region of Punjab from which it belongs, has been the center of Sufi culture for a long time
 is parivaar ke ek padosi mohammad jameel bataate hai ki tashaphin ke pita bhi ek sufi gayak rah chuke hai
 Although many people who believe in Islam do not accept the Sufi tradition and believe in Jamil, we do not want Muslims to do this kind of work
 aise logon ko sazaa milani chahie
 He has maligned Pakistan
 tippaniyan It is not yet clear where and when Tashfeen had a tendency towards fundamentalism, but according to one of her former teachers, when she returned to Pakistan for pharmacy studies, she was completely religious and started wearing burqa
 
 tashaphin ko padhaane vaale professor dow khalid hossain janbaz kaaphi jor dekar kehete hai ki unhen nahin lagata ki usne aisa kuch kiya he
 She was a very good student who never bothered the staff or her teammates
 ravivaar ko pakistan kii sarkaar ne ek bayaan jari karte hue california hamale kii ninda kii, saath hi grih mantri ne kaha ki islamabad ko is hamale ke liye jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa he
 Minister Chaudhary Nisar Ali Khan told the media that no country or religion can be held responsible for any crime committed by a particular person

 On Sunday, Pakistan's government issued a statement condemning the California attack, with the home minister saying Islamabad could not be held responsible for the attack
 mantri choudhary nisaar ali khan ne media se baatcheet main kaha ki kisi bhi vyakti vishesh dwaara kiye gaye aparaadh ke liye kisi desh yaa dharm ko jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa he
 We appreciate a prudent approach by the US administration on this issue
 ek aise vakt jab desh main zamin adhigrahan kanoon par virodh pradarshan ho rahe hai or koyala bill par bahes garam he, usee vakt sarkaar desh kii prakritik sampada or sansadhano se judaa khan evam khanij (niyaman) sanshodhan bill paas karaane main juty he
 It is also called the Mines and Minerals (development and Regulation - Amendment) Bill
 gaur se dekhen to is bill main baaki donon prastaavit bilon se adhik kamiyaan hai 
 
 
 Right now the Select Committee of Parliament is debating this
 sutron ke mutabik samati ke kai sadasyon ne bill ke bahut saare binduon par etraz kiya he or rajyasabha main is bill ke paas hone kii raah tab tak aasaan nahin he jab tak isamen baari bharkam sanshodhan na kiye jaayen NDTV India studied this law carefully and talked to experts on it, which shows that even after the enactment of this law, the government's auction claims of all the mineral deposits will be defeated
 pehle samajhate hai ki yah bill he kya
 a new law was proposed in India in 2010 to replace the law that had been in operation since 1957, but that proposal could not become a law until 2014
 nai sarkaar ne us nae bill kii jagah 1957 ke puraane kanoon main hi sanshodhan pesh kiye hai
 These amendments are changes that weaken the mining bill to some extent
 sarkaar ke hisaab se is bill ke laane se louh ayask, boxite, lim stone or manganeez kii khadaanon kaa aavanton nilaamee ke aadhaar par hoga
 The government is also stating that after the enactment of this law, the auction of the remaining minerals will benefit in the same way as the fresh auction of coal mines
 vidheyak ko padhein to iske liye sanshodhan bill kaa para 10
 a
 1 kahata he ki is kanoon ke banane ke baad mining se judi sari puraani arziyaan cancil ho jaaegi
 But in the next paragraph of the same bill, it says that companies who have been granted a permit (reconnaissance Permit) for investigation and survey (ie license to start work) will remain
 aaj hakeekat yah he ki desh main 80 fisadi se adhik gyaat khanij bhandaron main khojbin survey yaa prospective license die ja chuke hai
 In such a situation, the question is what will be the new law
 koyala maamle main yachikakarta rahe vakil or mining ke jaankaar sudeep shrivastav kehete hai, 'koyala block nilaamee main ab itnaa paisa isliye mil rahaa he, kyonki supreme court ne saare 214 kol block radd kiye lekin ye mining bill to puraane khanij bhandaron ko radd hi nahin karata, balki unhen kanoon vaid banaata he
 ' shrivastav bataate hai ki desh main takreeban saare gyaat khanij bhandar survey yaa prospective license ke zarie die ja chuke hai, jise yah nayaa kanoon radd nahin karegaa
 Giving the example of Chhattisgarh, he says, "except for the Khardha iron ore reserves in Chhattisgarh, the rest of the mines have either been mined or the companies have their prospecting license
 aise main ye kanoon kya kar paaegaa?' It is clear that after the introduction of this law, while a large number of mineral deposits will not be auctioned, this bill is also increasing the lease period of existing mines from 30 years to 50 years in a jolt
 abhi miyaad main yah badhotaree kaa adhikaar rajya sarkaron ke paas he, jahaan vah rajya ke phaayde ke hisaab se faisla karte hai
 It is important that at this time there is a lot of controversy in many mines stuck in Goa, Bellary and Shah Commission investigation
 ek jatke main 50 saal ke liye ye sari khadaanen unheen nijee companiyon ke haath main rahengi jo katghare main hai
 The bill was passed by the government on the strength of its majority in the Lok Sabha, but due to pressure from the opposition in the Rajya Sabha, it had to send this bill to the Select Committee
 lekin select cameti ko vichaar ke liye sirf saat din kaa hi vakt diya gaya he jo naakaafi lagata he
 Member of the Select Committee and CPI MP d Raja says, 'in its present form, it is a flawed bill which neither protects the interests of tribals nor takes care of the rights of the states
 ' The truth is also that the proposed bill of 2010 had a provision to spend 26% of the profits in the welfare of tribals
 bahucharchit samta faisle main bhi kam se kam 20 fisadi munafa adivasee kalyaan par kharch karne kii baat kahi gai, lekin maujuuda bill roylty kaa sirf ek tihaai hi kharch karne kii shart rakhata he jo munaafe ke 10 fisad se bhi kam hoga
 All minerals are the property of the state according to the constitution
 aise main yah sanshodhan bill rajyon ke adhikaar main jis tarah se katautee kar rahaa he, vah bhi vivaadon vivaadon main he
 For instance, the central government has also kept the right to determine which mineral deposits will be given to which size of minerals
 bhavishya main hone vaali nilaamee zarur rajya sarkarein karengi lekin uski sharton kaa antim nirdhaaran centre sarkaar karengi
 After the completion of one year of the Modi government, the BJP is relieved of the way the Sangh Parivar has softened its stand
 samanvay main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale sangh se bijepi ke mahasachiv banaae gaye ram madhav ne india today ke vishesh samvaadadaata santosh kumaar se khaas baatcheet kii
 Excerpts: How much did the Modi government meet on the agenda of nationalist organizations in a year? We gave a clean government, people were plagued by corruption in the last 10 years
 aresas ne is par apana ek prastaav bhi paas kiya tha
 Today the PM of the country is such that no one can be made corrupt
 parivaar sanghathan kii drushti se hamaare priy vishay hai samaaj ke nichle varg ke hit main kaam karnaa
 The two big programs that the Congress government has brought in 10 years, MNREGA and food security, we have brought four different and important schemes like Jan Dhan, Swachh Bharat, Pension and Insurance in one year
 isse hamaara sanghathan puraa khush he
 Some misinformation has resulted in misunderstandings
 lekin ham parivaar ke sanghathanon se nirantar sampark main hai
 But the BMS says that there should be a social impact assessment provision in the land acquisition? We are talking of taking land only for the Padbralak project
 industry, mal, colony banane ke liye jameen nahin le rahe
 In this, there is a provision to study what will be the impact on the society there
 esaiye ko hamane duusare rup main shaamil kiya he, isamen na sirf kisaanon, paryaavaran, jeev-jantu or baaki factor par kya asar hoga, uskaa bhi jayja liya jayega
 You reached agreement on Article 370 in Kashmir
 dekhie, is par galatfahami dur honi chahie kyonki dhara 370 jammu-kashmir sarkaar kaa vishay he hi nahin
 This is a central issue
 nunatam saajha kaarykram main hamane itnaa hi kaha ki jo bhi sanvaidhanik sthiti he, usko ham maanenge
 On the temple issue, Rajnath Singh said that there is no majority in Rajya Sabha, now Amit Shah said that there is no two-thirds majority
 aisa kyon?ram mandir kaa vishay is samay supreme court ke saamne he
 Let us wait a bit, as soon as there is a way out of the court, we will think about what to do next
 lekin vihip ne prastaav paas kiya, somnath kii tarj par cabinet se prastaav paas ho or kanoon banaaya jaae
 i only say that the subject of Ram temple is a national issue, not a political one
 hamen rashtriya str par sahmati banane kaa prayaas karnaa chahie
 Apart from this, there are two more options - if the Supreme Court gives a decision or the parties agree to a mutual agreement, we can also try for that
 sansad main kanoon banane par anek prashn uth sakate hai
 In such a situation, even after having the number, it is good to walk with the consent or move forward by quarreling
 donon paksh ke bich sahmati bane yah sambhav nahin dikhataa he
 Initially, the Sangh Parivar was aggressive, but when there is some anti-incumbency against the government, then the family is seen rallying behind the government
 kya vajah he?kuch nijee vichaar ko party kaa rukh nahin maananaa chahie
 As far as family organizations are concerned, i will say one thing clearly that they are all independent and dignified organizations
 unke jo pramukh hai, ve bahut varshon tak samarpit deshhit ke liye kaam karne vaale log hai
 They will have their own views and they will also express their views publicly
 ham sabko gag order nahin denge
 Do not you think that the Sangh Parivar is worried about the image that has been made against the government, so we have mobilized? Our family organizations wish this government to do good work
 samay-samay par unako bhi chintaa hoti he to nijee taur par bhi party or sarkaar ko samajhaate hai or kabhi jarurat padane par saarvajanik taur par rukh apnaanaa padataa he to hamen us par koi aapatti nahin he
 Recently we sat with all the BMS, BKS, Swadeshi Jagran Manch people on economic issues
 unke man main kai ashankaayen thim, jinhen hamane samajha
 Due to some propaganda, there was a doubt in his mind which we tried to overcome in the meeting
 kahin hriday parivartan to nahin he?nahin, hriday parivartan kii kya baat he
 We are all one family
 ek saath hai
 How will the Modi government align with the nationalist agenda? Remove the illusion that there is no development issue within Hindutva
 hindutv kaa matlab sirf ram mandir, dhara-370 nahin he, hindutv yani antyoday, garib kaa kalyaan he
 That is why we have created BMS, Kisan Sangh, Swadeshi Jagran Manch
 jahaan tak sangh kaa sawaal he to main khud teen dashak se zyada prachaarak rahaa hum or kah saktaa hum ki sangh kabhi bhi sarkaar kaa saapeksh sanghathan rahaa hi nahin he
 But the RSS has had bitter experiences with the previous NDA government
 pichhali sarkaar ke samay main sangh kaa pravaktaa tha
 There were talks with the government on many issues
 kuchhek sanghathanon ke vichaar kuch muddon par alag the
 Therefore, there was a lot of quarrel during the previous government, this is not true
 lekin pichhali sarkaar se anubhav lekar is baar or zyada talmail kaise ho, iskaa prayaas pehle din se shuru kar diya
 There is an effort from our side and also from the Sangh so that the family understands what we are doing, and we also understand their concerns and thoughts, this effort will go on continuously

 North MCD has chosen 11 such roads on the orders of the NGT
 jahaan avaidh parkig karne par ab kai guna zyada jurmaana vasula jayega
 Tenders for this have also been removed
 nigam ke mutabik in 11 sadakon par shuruaati 10 minute to parking muft rahegi lekin uske baad parking fees lagaai jaaegi
 In this, care will be taken that the local residents and traders do not face any problem due to this
 unhen is niyam se baahar rakhaa gaya he lekin tabhi jab unke paas parking thekedaar ke diye stikar honge
 According to the new rule, for parking a car on the road, Rs 50 per 2-wheeler will be charged Rs 100 per hour
 ek ghante baad se lekar agle paanch ghante tak 2-whilers se 125 rupaye vasule jaaenge to vahiin kaaron ke liye ye rakam 250 rupee hogi
 At the 10-hour parking, two wheelers will have to pay Rs 250, while car drivers will have to pay Rs 500, and if it is late, the amount will be doubled ie Rs 500 for 2 wheelers and Rs 1000 for cars
 tempo, bas, trek or anya commercial vaahanon ke liye ye raashi 300 rupee se lekar 2500 rupee tak hogi
 According to the corporation, this will improve the situation of traffic jams on the road, because giving such a daily amount will not be a matter of one's bus, and if there is strictness, they will be aware to use public vehicles

 Has there been any new threat to the security of Safdarjung Air Force Station in Delhi? At least the Airforce is citing the same thing by erecting a high wall between the Air Force Station and Jaipur Polo Ground
 is diwaar ke nirmaan ko lekar desh main polo khelon ke vikaas or toornaments yojit karne vaali sanstha indian polo association yani ipie or bhartiya airforce ke bich itani badi ki maamaladilli hoicourttak pahunch gaya
 While the Polo Association has accused the Airforce of threatening criminal attitudes and encroaching on the land of the Association, the Air Force has given security reasons for building a wall on the ground
 diwaar kii dadaageeri: dilli hoicourt main polo or airforce ke bich ghamasanjhagade kii shuruyaat march 2016 main hui jab safadarajang airforce stesan or jaipur polo ground ke bich airforce ne diwaar banani shuru kii
 The IPA wrote the first letter to Air Force Commanding Officer Pawan Mohai on 19 March asking questions on the construction of the illegal Air Force wall
 march beetaa, april beetaa, may beetaa or june bhi biit gaya
 The Air Force continued to build the wall but did not respond to the letters until 14 July
 lihaaja ipie airforce ke khilaafdilli hoicourtki sharan main pahunch gayi
 By filing Mandamus writ in the High Court, the IPA has demanded the Air Force to stop all construction and restore the status quo
 14 july kii chitthee main airforce ne pathankot airbase hamale kaa diya hawala aakhirkaar 14 july ko airforce stesan ke mukhya prashaskeey adhikari aditya jain ne diwaar banane kii vajah kuch yun bataai- “is diwaar kaa nirmaan puure desh main raksha pratishthanon kii suraksha ko lekar uthe khatre ke maddenjar kiya ja rahaa he
 Especially after the attack on the Pathankot airbase
 yahi nahin, diwaar ke nirmaan kii sweekruti shahari vikaas mantralay ne di he
 Anyway, Jaipur Polo Ground has been used by both Airforce and IPA
 ”'airforce kii niyat he kharaab'ipie ke dilli jone ke steward adhiraj singh kaa kahana he ki airforce kii niyat main khot isi baat se jaahir ho jaataa he ki wo ab tak is jameen ke saajha istemaal hote rahane kii baat karti he
 If it was only for security, the Air Force would have built this wall at the boundary of Air Force Station and Jaipur Polo Ground and not between the Polo Ground
 ipie kii ore se yachika daakhil karne vaale vakil amit tyaagi ne kaha kipthankot airbesahamale kaa dar or suraksha kaa hawala dekar polo ground kii jameen par airforce avaidh kabja karnaa chahta he
 What the Airforce is doing by constructing this wall is against the honor and values of the army

 The fight between the Congress and the BJP over Rafale continues
 congress (congress) is deal main baari ghotaleka aarope laga rahi he to modi sarkaar (modi Govt) isse inkaar kar rahi
 The Supreme Court has dismissed the petitions seeking the inquiry into the Rafale deal
 haalanki, prashanth bhushan or arun shouri andaalat main punarvichaar yachika bhi daakhil kar chukehain
 In the Winter Session of Parliament, this matter resonated a lot
 rahul gandhi kai baar rafel ko ek lakh 30 hajaar karod kii deal kah chuke to loksabhaa main arun jetali ne spasht kiya ki kul deal 58 hajaar karod kii hi he
 Later Rahul Gandhi retaliated by holding a press conference on Jaitley's figures
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar kahati he ki keemat gopneey he, phir kaise jetali ne 58 hajaar karod kii deal kii baat sweekaar kii
 In this way, the cost of an aircraft is 16 hundred crores, divided by the number of 36 aircraft
 jetali poochhate hai ki 1600 kaa aankada kahaan se aa rahaa he, khud unhone hi to daam kaa khulaasa kar diya he
 Rahul again reiterated why Modi government bought 500 million aircraft for 1600 crores? Why this deal happened, when it happened, how it happened, what happened between it, what are the allegations, what the Supreme Court has to say and what are the answers of the government, many questions related to it are flaring in the mind of the common man
 yahaan ham aise hi 10 pramukh sawaalon ke jariye aapako rafel deal(rafale Deal) kii puri kahani samajhane kii koshish karenge
 Jaitley said, "the Rafale issue is not a matter of policy, administrative or governance
 yah jaanch kaa masalaa he ki deal saaf-suthri he yaa nahin? supreme court ne kaha he ki 'keemat, HAL or ofaset ko lekar ham 'santusht' hai
 'what will the JPC do in the investigation? "jaitley also raised the issue of the JPC formed during the Bofors deal, saying that" the report given by the committee headed by the late Shankaranand said that bribe was not paid but winding up was paid 
 is prakaar jepisi ne bhrashtachar ke masale kii lipapoti kar di
 Taunting the Congress, he said, "the discretion of the Supreme Court was satisfied, but the need for Congress elections was not satisfied
" "sarkaar kaa jawaab- isamen sarkaar kii koi bhoomka nahin he
 Dassault did not give HAL the confidence to build aircraft within the stipulated timeframe
 jisase vaarta main gatirodh utpann ke kaaran dasolt ne echeel ko deal ke centre main nahin rakhaa
 Dassault will work with close to 100 offset partners including Reliance Defense

 In February 2014, the government informed Parliament that one billion plastic notes of 10 rupees would be printed and 5 cities have been selected for their field trials

 How are plastic notes, what is their specialty: Currency notes made of plastic are clearer than paper notes

 desh main mahila matdaan ek ajeeb virodhabhas saamne lekar aata he
 While there is a steady increase in the share of women in voting in national and state elections, there is not much momentum in their representation in parliament and legislatures
 1971 main mahila matadaataaon kii hissedari mahaj 48 fisadi thi, jabaki 1984 main yah aankada badhkar 60 pratishat tak ho gaya
 The increase in female vote percentage that year was largely due to the sympathy wave that followed the assassination of Indira Gandhi
 haalanki 1991 main 10 pratishat se adhik kii giravat dekhi gai, magar uske baad se mahila matdaan pratishat main lagaataar naatakeey badhotaree dekhi gai
 In the last decade, especially after 2009, with a special focus on women voters, their share of parliamentary and assembly elections has narrowed significantly compared to men
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main, 67
 Women turnout 65 compared to 1 percent men
 3 pratishat tha
 Therefore, in 1967, the turnout of women was 11 percent of men
 2 pratishat kam tha, 2014 tak donon ke bich ke matdaan pratishat kaa antar ghatakar maatr 1
 8 percent remained
 phir bhi, deshvyapee rajnatik tantra main ab bhi kaaphi had tak purushon kaa dabadabaa barkaraar he or vah pitrusatta kaa garh bana hua he
 Therefore, female representation in Parliament and legislatures is very low
 mahila loksabhaa sadasyon kii taadaad 1952 main 4
 11 in 2014, up 7 percent
 4 pratishat ho pai he
 However, the number of women mps in Rajya Sabha in 2014 was slightly higher at 15 percent
 loksabhaa main mahila saansadon kaa pratishat 1962 main 6
 3 percent and 3 in 1977
 5 pratishat tha (ab tak kaa sabase kam)
 In 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated just before the elections, a large number of women candidates were elected (38 out of 42) from the Congress and 7 percent of the women mps
 9 pratishat tak ho gaya
 This number declined in the next election
 lekin 1990 ke dashak kii shuruyaat se dhire-dhire vruddhi hui he
 In 2009, women's share in Parliament was 10
 5 pratishat thi jo 2014 main maamuli badhat ke saath 11
 4 percent
 sabhi chunaavon main, mahila saansadon kaa nirvachan pratishat mahila ummidavaaron ke pratishat se adhik rahaa he
 Political parties claim that they field fewer women candidates than men because women are less likely to win
 phir bhi, mahila ummidavaaron kii tulana main jeetne vaali mahila saansadon ke anupaat kaa aankada bataata he ki mahila pratyaashiyon kii chunaav 'jeetne kii kshamta' purushon kii tulana main bahut adhik he
 This contradiction is even more acute in states
 haal ke dinon main, pramukh vidhansabha chunaavon main purushon kii tulana main mahilaon kaa matdaan pratishat adhik rahaa he
 Nevertheless, the percentage of women legislators in legislatures has been consistently lower than in the Parliament
 yah baari virodhabhas matadaataaon ke anya virgon ke matdaan rujhaan or unke pratinidhitiv ke anupaat se ekadam ulat he
 For example, the representation of Other Backward Classes (obcs) in Parliament and legislatures has increased considerably with the increasing voting percentage of backward caste voters after the Mandal Commission report was implemented
 ucch matdaan ke baavjood mahilaon ke kam pratinidhitiv kii tulana bas alpsankhyakon, vishesh rup se musalamaanon se hi kii ja sakati he jo baari matdaan ke baavjood sansad yaa vidhansabhaon (jammu-kashmir ko chhodkar) main apana pratinidhitiv nahin badha sake hai
 Under pressure to field more women candidates, political parties are taking out female candidates in the constituencies reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
 norge institute of international afares kii raajnneeti vigyaani franceska aar
 "political parties tend to regard male leaders in reserved constituencies as frivolous compared to other regions," says Jensenius
 partiyaan aksar apane sanghathan ke bheetar jati vyavastha ke padanukram kaa hi anusaran karti hai
 "jamie Hinston, a James C
 Gaither Fellow of the Carnegie Endowment, estimates that between 1980 and 2014, seven percent of the reserved seats in the Lok Sabha were women candidates, compared to only 4 in the general seats
 8 pratishat tha
 Political parties field more women candidates in reserved constituencies, so a large proportion of women who win Lok Sabha elections are from these seats
 hinston ke mutabik, ''1980 ke baad se, arakshit loksabhaa kshetron main ausatan 16
 2 percent of female candidates have been victorious while 11 in general seats
 5 pratishat mahila ummidavaaron kii jeet hui he
 "between 1952 and 1991, there is not a big difference in women's candidacy rates between reserved and unreserved seats
 1991 ke baad ayodhya or naukariyon ke liye jati-aadhaarit aarakshan jaise mudde dhruvikaran kaa kaaran bane or rajnatik dalon ke bich baari pratispardhaa shuru hui jiskaa asar chunavi samar main mahila or purushon kii sankhya ke antar ke rup main bhi dikhaa
 The struggle for the Women's Reservation Bill started from 1996
 parinamswaroop, mahila ummidavaaron ke liye arakshit or anarakshit nirvachan kshetron ke bich kaa antar or spasht ho gaya he
 Despite the increase in the voting percentage of women, this contradiction of under-representation is not seen in panchayat elections as between one-third and half of seats are reserved for women in panchayats
 1996 se mahila aarakshan vidheyak ke pakshdhar loksabhaa main mahilaon ke liye ek-tihaai aarakshan kii maang kar rahe hai
 Both BJP and Congress claim to be in favor of this bill, yet this bill hangs in the balance

 Whatever formula is coming, they are giving it in TV and media

 There is no response to the proposal sent to Congress through Sharad Pawar
 unhone kaha ki arvind kejariwal ne jo vishakhapatanam main bolaa wo rahul gandhi se pehali baithak ke bare main he
 Which is not new because there is no meeting with Rahul Gandhi after that
 vahiin, pradesh congress adhyaksh shila dikshit (sheila Dikshit) ne kaha ki dilli kii sabhisaaton siton par congress (congress) ke ummidavaar honge
 His old stand on the alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party remained intact
 NDTV ne jab unase poocha ki dilli kii saaton siton par kya congress ke ummidavaar honge? unhone kaha haa
 Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said that he had met Rahul Gandhi about Aam Aadmi Party's alliance with Congress
 shila dikshit itani mahatvapurn netaa nahin hai
 He said that Rahul has denied the alliance
 unase jab poocha gaya ki aapane kaha tha gathbandhan par aaj faisla ho jayega, to shila dikshit (sheila Dikshit) ne kaha, 'maine nahin kaha tha, aaj ho jayega
 He must decide who to decide
 ' unhone saaton siton par congress (congress) ke ummidavaaron ke chunaav ladane kii pushti kii
 Meanwhile, in Visakhapatnam, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today said that Congress President Rahul Gandhi has refused to ally with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in New Delhi for the Lok Sabha elections
 patrakaron se baatcheet ke dauraan ‘aap' pramukh ne kaha ki unhone haal hi main gandhi se mulaakaat kii thi
 The Congress President refused to contest the election with AAP
 dilli congress kii adhyaksh shila dikshit ke unase sampark na karne ke bayaan par kejariwal (arvind Kejriwal) ne kaha, ‘hamane rahul gandhi se mulaakaat kii thi
 Dixit (sheila Dikshit) is not such an important leader
 ' kejariwal loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko satta se dur rakhane ke liye lagaataar congress se gathbandhan karne kii apil kar rahe hai
 Party sources had said that the Delhi Congress is divided on the issue of alliance
 dikshit or unke teen kaaryakari adhyaksh gathbandhan kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 a highly placed source of the Congress recently said that the alliance is unlikely, considering Delhi's long-term results
 sutara ne kaha, ‘bada sawaal yah he ki gathbandhan ke baad aap 2020 chunaav main congress kaa muqabla kaise karegi
 Also, the party will not gain much politically as only 2-3 seats are being offered by Kejriwal

 Anna's worry bells threat to the party: Pankaj Pushkar, MLA from Timarpur of Aam Aadmi Party, has said that the concern that Anna Hazare has expressed is absolutely correct
 pankaj ne kaha he ki anna hajaare kii chintaa ko ham log nazarandaaj nahin kar sakate hai, unki is tippanee kaa matlab he ki ab party ke liye khatre kii ghanti baj chuki abhi bhi vakt he sanbhal jaaen
 Raising the tone of disagreement in the party, Pankaj Pushkar has said in a conversation with 'aaj Tak' that it seems that one cannot register a disagreement in this party as the party leadership, indiscriminately, discourages disagreement whenever a party enters a disagreement
 If the party leadership tells him traitor
 nandak niyare raakhiyetimarpur se aam aadmi party ke vidhayak pankaj pushkar kaa kahana he ki jab aam aadmi party banaai ja rahi thi tab party main loktantric vyavastha komajbootakarne ke liye kai cametiyaan banaai gai thi, lekin dhire-dhire sabhi cametiyaan khatm kii ja rahi he yani party kaa loktantr hi khatm hota ja rahaa he
 Like other parties, the AAP was also in doubt
 Pankaj Pushkar's Pankaj said that the way the functioning of the Aam Aadmi Party is happening, it does not seem that this party was formed to work in a different way, new type Leave politics, like all other parties, its style of functioning is becoming
 party koi dukaan nahin, jab chahen band kar denhal hi main jab arvind kejariwal ne bayaan diya tha ki vah party main galat harakatein bardaasht nahin karenge chaahe iske liye unhen party hi naa band kyon naa karnaa pade
 On this statement, Pankaj Pushkar said that the party runs from the democratic system and to dissolve it only democratic process has to be adopted
 kejariwal kaa yah bayaan dikhalaataa he ki vah party ko loktantr se nahin chalaa rahe
 Kejriwal Pankaj Pushkar, who is surrounded by sycophants in the party, said that i do not like to believe this, but it is true that now in the party they are being liked only by those who mix yes, there are some people who are eyes They also give false praise by putting eyes in it
 aise logon kaa hi party main sammaan ho rahaa he, pankaj pushkar ne mukhyamantri ko netaji sambodhit karte hue kaha ki ab kuch log party ke liye nishpaksh nahin, chapalusee bhari baaten bolte hai

 Rahul Gandhi alleged that Anil Ambani's company did not even own the land, he bought the land with the same money that Dasso gave
 ambani kii company ko jaanboojhkar phayda pahunchaaya gaya
 Rahul Gandhi said that the CBI chief was removed because of the Rafale deal
 kyonki narendra modi or anil ambani ke bich main partnership thi, hamaara kaam puure desh ko sach bataanaa he
 Rahul Gandhi alleged that only two people have benefited in this whole deal, those two are Narendra Modi and Anil Ambani
 congress adhyaksh bole ki pehle daso ne kaha tha ki kyonki anil ambani kii company ke paas jameen thi, isliye unke saath sauda kiya gaya
 But now the truth has come out that the land was bought with the money of Dasa, that is, the land was bought by Dasa
 ye log janata ke paise se rafel vimaan kharid rahe hai, lekin janata ko hi daam nahin bataa rahe hai
 The Congress president said that why did Dasso put 284 crore rupees in the loss-making company of Rs 8 lakh? Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that whatever decision has been taken on Kirafel, only the 'boss' has done it
 bhrashtachar kii puri kisht anil ambani ke khate main gai he
 What has been done in Rafael is completely wrong
 unhone kaha ki ab to supreme court ne bhi rafel deal ke daam kii jaankaree maangi he, lekin sarkaar ne kaha he ki vah ye jaankaree nahin de sakate hai
 The President of France told me that in secret practice there is no talk of hiding the price and it cannot be done
 unhone kaha ki france ko bhi pataa he ki is deal main bhrashtachar hua he
 Rahul Gandhi said that there is no fault of Manohar Parrikar in this deal, he said that Parrikar also told the country that the decision is not mine but the boss
 koi bhi dephence deal karne se pehle cabinet deal kii jarurat hoti he, lekin ye baithak deal hone ke baad hui he
 Rahul said that we want JPC to be formed in this matter
 unhone sibiai chif ko bhi hataa diya, pradhanmantri raat ko so nahin paa rahe hai
 The Prime Minister is afraid of the investigation, which is why he removed the CBI Chief

 Karim and Magadh University Registrar Nalin Shastri investigated the scam
 jisamen kai gambhir aaropon kii pushti kii he
 But the university has not taken any action so far
 jaanch report main yah paaya gaya ki kiraye ke bhawan main chal rahe arched bijness college ko vishvavidhyalay ke adhiniyamon ko taak par rakh kar vishvavidhyalay dwaara sthai sambanddhan dene kii anushansa kar di gai thi, lekin rajya sarkaar ke paas se is sambandh main koi anumati praapt nahin hui
 The arcade group claimed to have permanent affiliation on all its advertisements, brochures, buildings and websites, which is an attempt to mislead students
 jaanch report main yah paaya gaya he ki mahavidhyalay maatr 5 katthe ke kiraye ke makaan main avasthit he
 In such a situation, a permanent relationship cannot be given to him
 arched dwaara dikhaae gaye ek anya kiraaye ke anexi bhawan ko jaanch dal dwaara vishvavidhyalay se sweekrut nahin hone evam niyamon ke pratikul bataaya he
 According to the investigation report, Arcade Business College has not been approved by the government under the provision of Section 21 (2) (d) of the University Act
 rajbhavan kii jaanch report ke anusaar arched bijness college ko magadh vishvavidhyalay kii mileebhagat se prati course 250-250 seat par namakan lene kii anumati gaiyrkanoonee rup se de diya gaya he

 In this way, the enrollment of more than 2500 students is being taken in the institute by combining all the courses studying in part-one, part-two and part-three
 jinako padhaane kii vyavastha kaa nirikshan vishvavidhyalay dwaara nahin kiya gaya he
 In such a situation, it is being run like a shop selling degrees

 The two colleges of the Arcade Business College, running at Patna's Rajendra Nagar and Sagun Mor, have been playing games for years to get students a degree
 1998 se chal rahe arched bijness college ko mahavidhyalay kii apni bhoomi or bhawan nahin hone par bhi sambanddhan diya gaya he jabaki is tarah ke asthai sambanddhan ko 4 varsh se adhik tak nahin diya ja saktaa
 According to the Bihar University Act, the private college or institute taking up the education should have at least 5 acres in the urban area or 10 acres in the rural area
 doshiyon ko bachaane ke prayaas main juta vishvavidhyalay prashasanrajbhavan kii jaanch report main darj baari aniyamittaaon ke maamle ke ujagar hone ke baad se magadh vishvavidhyalay ke adhikariyon ke bich hadkamp much gaya he
 In this case, the involvement of many present and past officials is being revealed
 ab vishvavidhyalay ke upar doshi santhaan or use laabh pahunchane vaale adhikariyon par karrwai karne kaa dawaab he
 a lot of efforts are also being made by the university to suppress the case, but now after the investigation report of Raj Bhavan comes, it will be compulsory to take legal action
 abhi tak vishvavidhyalay dwaara is sandarbh main arched santhaan par koi karrwahee nahin kii gai he
 Time and again the university is giving time for clarification

 aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki di company ne apana nayaa headquarter bana liya he
 This new headquarters is built in Belize, USA
 aaj tak ne ek bada khulaasa kiya he ki kaise di company apni shinaakht auki shakhsiyat donon badal rahaa he
 How is it spreading its net in different parts of the world
 di company ke is nae adde kaa kulasa tab hua jab bhartiya agenciyon ko pataa laga ki daaud ibrahim ke bhai anis ibrahim ne beliz desh kaa passport hasil kar liya he
 The number of this passport is -A001407 and Anees Ibrahim used this passport
 yani is passport kii binah par anis ibrahim ne beliz kii naagarikta le lee
 According to the changed citizenship plot of the conspiracy, Anees Ibrahim submitted Indian passport to Dubai Counsel on 2 September 1996
 uske baad se hi bhartiya agenciyon ko shaq ho gaya tha ki anis kisi duusare desh ke passport par pakistan or saudi arab ke safar kar rahaa he
 After a long investigation, Indian investigative agencies got the news from Dubai that Anees Ibrahim has taken citizenship of Central Belize of Central America and from Dubai he has acquired this Belize passport
 mumbai bam dhamaakon ke jaanch adhikari o pi chatwaal, jinhone daud or anis ke kilaaf interpol kaa red corner notice jari karavaaya tha unhone bataaya ki saazish ke tahat daud ke bhai anis ne beliz kii naagarikta hasil kar lee
 When the Government of India came to know about this, the Government forced the government to cancel this passport
 lekin iske peeche anis kii saazish kahin zyaada khataranaak thi
 Dawood is also no longer Dawood, the Indian government has canceled the passport of Anees, but the question remains whether along with the passport, this Central American paradise has destroyed the dreaded d Company's footprints or Belize still remains d Company's security
 Whereabouts don pahchaan badal kar ek mulk se duusare mulk main gum rahaa he or antarrashtriya police ab bhi unki puraani pahchaan haath main liye gum rahi he
 It is not just Anees who has changed his identity
 daaud ibrahim bhi badal chukaa he chola
 Even Tiger Memon, the main accused in the Mumbai attacks, is no longer Tiger Memon
 1993 ke mumbai bam dhamaakon kaa mastermind or pakistan kii kufia agency iesai kaa sabase khataranaak mohara
 The person whose name shakes the soul of the biggest builders of Mumbai, this person's name is Tiger Memon
 tiger memon bana jamaalalekin pakistan main mumbai bam dhamaakon ke is master mind ko koi tiger memon ke naam se nahin jaanata
 The name of Tiger Memon is Jamal
 pakistan main tiger memon ko log jamaal ke naam se jaanate hai
 OP Chatwal has also revealed this
 chatwaal ne bataaya ki bharat ke paas aise saboot hai ki tiger memon or uski family ko pakistan ne nakli naamon par asli passport bana diya he
 The passport has the original photo of Tiger but the name is fake
 tiger memon kaa naam jamaal he
 Dawood has several passporters after Dawood Ibrahim
 daud kaa nayaa naam he shaikh daaud hasan
 He is known by this name in Pakistan
 lekin daaud ke paas pakistan kaa sirf ek nahin balki kai passport hai
 And these passports have been handed over by the top officials of Pakistan to the don himself
 inhen passport ke sahare daaud ibrahim saudi arab se lekar singapore tak berok-tok safar kar rahaa he
 This fact was also confirmed by the investigating officer of Mumbai bomb blasts and currently CBI consultant OP Chatwal
 in kulaason se saafe zaahir he ki daaud ke naam par jari hone vaale interpol notice kaa koi matlab nahin rah jaataa
 Because David has completely changed his identity
 shaayad isi binah par pakistan baar-baar yahi rat lagaataa he ki uske paas daaud ibrahim naam kaa koi shaks nahin he

 doosraa twit karte hai ki kanoon apane haath main na len balki kanoon ko apana kaam karne den
 What is this tweet about? kya rijiju yah kah rahe hai ki kanoon ko apana kaam nahin karne diya ja rahaa he? or wo koun he jo kanoon ko apana kaam nahin karne de rahaa he? yah baat inke twit se spasht nahin hoti he
 Then Kiran Rijiju third tweets that it is not a question of supporting any group, just do not take the law in your hands
 kiran rijiju kisi niraakaar ko kah rahe hai yaa kisi saakaar ko uparokt panktiyon se spasht nahin hota he
 If he is telling a lawyer, then he could have written clearly
 jab laga ki vakeelon ke samarthan main twit kar diya to phir twit karte hai
 By the time the minister was busy deleting his tweet and retweeting, the families of Delhi Police personnel had started reaching outside the police headquarters
 unke saath apni apni duty khatm kar jawan bhi aane lage the
 Seeing the video which has united these soldiers for the demonstration, the lawyer will also feel that the lawyer who raised his hand on the constable Karan weakened the case of the lawyers
 is tasviir main consteble karan ek anushaasit sipaahi kii tarah bartaav karata he
 He does not get angry even after being killed
 karan apane mukademe ke silsile main saket court pahunchaa tha
 But these lawyers started beating him
 kohni se bhi maaraa or karan ke helmet ko uski bike par de maaraa
 Throughout this episode, Karan demonstrated calmness and courage
 gussa nahin kiya
 The Gentleman was treated by the police and the lawyers went on an unilateral assault
 ise dekhnaa ek tarah kii hataasha se guzaranaa tha jo shaayad hi koi non resident indian samaj sakegaa
 The frustration is whether the Iqbal of this police has fallen so much that whoever wants it will take off his uniform
 hataasha is baat se bhi thi ki jawan kii koi haisiyat nahin hoti, aisa samajhane vaale logon kaa hausala kitna bad jayega
 Everyone knows that there is no organization of soldiers
 unke liye koi twit nahin karata he
 This question is about a young man's self-esteem
 aaj kii ghatana bataati he ki desh bhar ke javaanon ke liye union kaa hona kitna zaruri he
 It is a must that the IPS Association tweeted and said that the incident which took place between the police and the lawyer is unfortunate
 public main jo tathy he use lekar santulit nazariyaa hua he
 The entire country is with the policemen who have been insulted
 jiske dwaara bhi kanoon todane kii koshish kii gai he ham uski aalochana karte hai
 Obviously it was not enough
 police ke javaanon ke bheetar yah baat ghar kar gai ki dilli police ke ayukta amuly patnayak na to apni police ke liye twit karte hai or na ghayal police vaale ko dekhne jate hai
 Then what happened in Delhi had never happened in the era of news channels
 jab laga ki ek jawan ke liye samaaj aage nahin aa rahaa he to javaanon ke parivaar or jawan saamne aa gaye
 As the days passed, the performance of the soldiers increased
 binar poster tarah tarah kii baaten karne lage
 Started seeking justice
 patniyon ke haath main lage ye binar aane vaale samay main dilli hi nahin desh bhar ke sipaahiyon ko behatar sammaan dilaane vaale hai
 Kiran Bedi's poster also appeared
 ki aapaki kami khal rahi he
 Kiran Bedi had a confrontation with lawyers
 jisase wo hero bani thim
 Today he is the Lieutenant Governor
 kaise twit kar sakati thim
 His tweet did not come, which is understandable
 magar kamishnar amuly patnayak ke hote jawan agar ritair ho chuke police afasar ko yaad karen to acha nahin he
 Whatever the image of the police, it should not be the basis
 phir to patrakaron kii bhi chhavi acchhee nahin he
 The image of leaders is not good
 us aadhaar par is ghatana ko nahin dekha ja saktaa
 It was also sad to see the police helpless but it was pleasant to see them organized and fighting for their honor
 koi vardi main ro rahaa ho to uski takalif samajni chahie
 He is a policeman but also a human being
 isliye ro rahaa he
 The effect of this demonstration was that 24 hours after the assault with Constable Karan, Delhi Police registered a case
 marpet karne vaale vakeelon ke khilaaf
 The soldiers came forward and placed ten demands on their behalf
 yahaan tak kah diya ki jajon kii suraksha main lagi police ko hataa liya jaae
 This was not a normal thing
 yah halaat hi kyon paidaa hue ki kisi ko yah baat kehani pade
 It is declaring in a way that the Iqbal of the state is over
 state or naagarik ke bich bharose ke sambandh kii daraar gahari ho gai he
 It needs to be filled
 dilli police ke javaanon kii maang sahi he ki unhen association banane kaa adhikaar milanaa chahie
 Not only Delhi, the police all over the country should get the right to form associations
 jab ipies kaa association he to jawan kaa bhi hona chahie
 a series of meetings started within the Delhi Police Headquarters
 leftinent garvanar ke yahaan bhi baithak hui
 First Commissioner Amulya Patnaik addressed
 pradarshan main jute police or unke parivaar waalon ne anushaasan kaa paalan kiya or shantipurna tareeke se pradarshan kiya
 First listen to Amulya Patnaik and then in the evening the Joint CP came and told what the result of the meeting was
 ve ghayal police kaa behtareen ilaaj hoga
 He also said that action will be taken against the lawyers on the complaint of the policeman
 exiaar darj hui he
 According to the law
 itnaa sunate hi police or police ke parivaar vaale union union ke naare lagane lage
 They wanted to know what was decided on the union's case
 is magha par thos aashwaasan nahin mila
 Union not found
 joint seepi devesh shrivastav ne unhen bataaya ki unke kya adhikaar hai
 What is their forum? javaanon kii ek or maang thi ki tees hazari kii ghatana ke baad jin 16 pulisavaalon ko suspend kiya gaya he unka nilamban waapas lo
 On this, when Joint CP Devesh Srivastava started telling, the voice of the slogans started getting so high that his talk started getting lost
 jawan nilamban vaapasi par ade rahe
 The rest of Devesh Srivastava's words could not be heard in the noise
 is bich centre ne dilli hai court ne spashtikaran maanga ki yah kehane kii kya aavashyaktaa thi ki vakeelon ke khilaaf koi sakht karrwai nahin hogi
 On Sunday, two senior police officers were transferred by a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice c Harishankar
 special kamishnar sanjay singh kaa tabadalaa kar diya
 Additional DCP Harinder Singh transferred
 do assistant sab inspector ko nilambit kar diya gaya
 No action was taken against any lawyer
 vakeelon ko sabase acha ilaaj dene ke nirdesh die gaye
 Did it make the jawans feel that nothing has been said about their treatment? vakeelon ke khilaaf karrwai nahin hui
 As soon as evening, Delhi Police personnel gathered at India Gate
 isamen police parivaar ke bujurg bhi march kar rahe the
 The CRPF was deployed here
 shaam ho gai lekin abhi tak koi samaadhaan nahin niklaa tha
 The soldiers were not unhappy with this incident 
 vahi sadak par nahin the
 The IPS officers of Delhi Police were also growing uneasily
 unke twit bataa rahe the ki ve apane netritv se khafa the
 Those who are in service also started speaking for their soldiers
 zaahir he wo us santulan kii raajnneeti ko dekh rahe the jo ekatarfa hoti ja rahi thi
 IPS Madhur Verma wrote that i am sorry, we are the police
 hamaara koi astitv nahin he
 We are not a family
 hamaara koi maanavadhikaar nahin he
 Reacting to this, Asmal Khan tweeted that we are punching bags
 main jaanane ke liye utsuk hum ki koun se senior afasar hai jo ghayal police vaale se aspataal main mili hai
 Police morale is slowly falling
 ipies sanyukta ne twit kiya he ki yah bahut baichaiyn karne vaala he
 We should be fair but whoever is a punk should be called a goon this time
 ipies di roopa ne twit kiya ki puure system kaa mazaaq bana diya he
 i wish that those who are in the leadership take strict action, otherwise the morale of the police force will be broken and the goons will be forced to keep taking the law in their hands
 andaman nicobar ke police pramukh kaale kot main gunde aa gaye hai, jo dilli ke taane bane ko dhwast kar rahe hai
 There is no need to maintain law fear among them
 dilli police ko zarurat he ki puraane vakeelon or police ke jhagade ke cese main stand len
 IG of Arunachal Pradesh Dr Sagar Prati Hooda tweeted that no one is above the law
 jisane gundgardee kii he use sazaa milani chahie
 IPS Hooda wrote that the incident of Tis Hazari has shaken the collective consciousness of the whole society
 samay aa gaya he ki vakeelon ko bhi kanoon padhanaa chahie
 Former Commissioner Neeraj Kumar tweeted that i agree
 koi netaa nahin
 There is no brotherhood
 agar team ke ek sadsy par gunde kabza kar lete hai or koi netritv saamne nahin aata he
 The police leadership is hidden
 sharmnaak he
 Former DGP Prakash Singh tweeted that in a country where a police constable is killed every week, chaos can be said
 kya ipies monica bharadwaj ko molest kiya gaya? monica bharadwaj ne apni taraf se koi shikaayat darj nahin karai he lekin ek audio viral hua he jisamen unka angrakshak kah rahaa he ki usne madam ko bachaane kii koshish kii lekin madam ko vakeelon ke jhund ne gher liya tha
 Was abusing jab vah madam ko bachaane pahunchaa to uski sarvice revolver chhinane kii koshish kii gai
 If this happens, should the DCP not register an FIR, if the IPS officer does not speak, then who will speak
 is baat kii jaanch honi chahie ki kya monica bharadwaj ko shikaayat darj karaane se roka gaya he?na din guzar rahaa tha na shaam guzar paa rahi thi
 The number of soldiers was increasing
 sab kuch tehra hua tha
 Delhi Police personnel were also doing duties on one side
 duty ke baad pradarshan aa rahe the
 The movement of soldiers started getting support from organizations of other states
 haryana bihar or tamilnadu ke ipies sangh ne saport kiya tha
 The last time the Delhi Police performed so long was in 1967
 apane liye ghar or kaam ke aath ghante kii maang ko lekar
 Things are not normal
 leftinent garvanar ne kaha he ki bharosa banaae rakhen or police ke senior afasar ghayalon se mili
 This order states that there has been a huge lapse from the police leadership
 ghayal police waalon se milanaa ek saamaanya baat he
 After all, why did the police officers not go
 kya pataa isse baat itani nahin badhati
 The lieutenant governor has appealed to maintain peace and harmony
 aaj pradarshan police hi nahin kar rahi thi, vakil bhi kar rahe the
 On the other hand, the other party in this whole case is the lawyers who are still on strike in the lower courts of Delhi
 unki maang he ki hinsa ke liye doshi pulicekarmiyon ke kilaaf sakht karrwai hone tak wo apni hadtaal nahin todenge
 The Bar Council of India, after taking stock of the incident on Saturday, issued a statement urging the lawyers to withdraw their strike
 is baat par bhi naaraazgi jataai gai vakeelon ke vesh main kuch utpaati log vakaalat kii chhavi karaab kar rahe hai
 Bar Council of India chairman Manan Kumar Mishra said that such lawyers are being encouraged due to the laxity of lawyers' bar associations
 unhone baar associationon ko hinsa karne vaale vakeelon kii pahchaan karke unke naam baar council ko dene kaa nirdesh diya
 Manan Kumar Mishra, however, raised serious questions about the role of the Delhi Police in this entire episode and said that the dharna that was performed at the police headquarters was merely a drama in the guise of trying to hide the culprits
 dilli ucch nyaayalay ne balaatkaar ke 5 saal puraane maamle main nichali adaalat ke faisle ko palatate hue aaropee ko reeha kar diya he
 In this case in 2011, the lower court in 2013 sentenced the accused to 10 years
 hoicourt ne kaha ki mahila vyakti ke saath 'liv in' sambandh main thi or kathith ghatana ke bare main uske bayaan main kai baaten 'gambhir rup se kamjor' hai
 The lower court had convicted the person under sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to 10 years
 adaalat ne vyakti par 15000 rape jurmaana bhi lagaaya tha
 Justice Pratibha Rani said that it is clear from the documents mentioned in the judgment that the woman was living alone away from her husband in Delhi and that she had a live-in relationship with the appellant

 The High Court said that at some points in relation to the case, the woman made 'deliberate changes' and her testimony did not convince her

 The woman had alleged that the incident occurred on the intervening night of 13 and 14 January 2011 when she was alone at home and grieved over the death of her daughter

 confederation of aal india treders (cat) ke rashtriya mahaamantri praveen khandelwal ne somvaar ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii kadi aalochana kii or kaha ki wo satta main aane par jiesti ko khatm karne kii baat kah rahe hai
 Whereas he has no blue print of any other alternative tax regime
 vyapaariyon ke kandhe par bandook rakh kar apana raajnneetik nishaanaa saadhane kii is koshish kaa khandelwal ne kadaa virodh kiya or chetaya ki gandhi, vyapaariyon kaa kandhaa istemaal kar koi raajnneeti na karen, anyathaa aagaamee chunaavon main congress ko vyapaaree karaara jawaab denge
 Khandelwal said that Rahul Gandhi should not make the mistake of considering businessmen as fools
 vyapaaree jaanate hai ki unke liye kya acha he or kya bura
 He said that Rahul Gandhi should tell the traders what plans and programs they have for the businessmen of the country
 congress ne aazaadee se ab tak kii vyapaariyon kii upekshadarasal praveen khandelwal dilli main yojit ek vyapaaree sammelan ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 While he said that since independence, the Congress party has ruled the most in the country, but during the long reign of the Congress, the businessmen of the country were never placed on their priority and neither was justice done to the traders
 unhone sawaal kiya ki rahul gandhi bataaen ki jab centre main congress kii sarkaar thi tab kitni baar wo vyapaariyon ke pratinidhimandal se mili athwa jin rajyon main congress kii sarkaar thi un rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ne kitni baar vyapaariyon se mulaakaat kii
 7 crore traders of the country mobilized - will vote unilaterally In the context of the upcoming elections, Khandelwal said that more than 7 crore traders across the country are now fully converted into a vote bank
 gauratlab he ki cat ne do maheene pehle desh bhar main "ek desh-ek vyapaaree-das vot" kaa rashtriya abhiyaan chalaaya tha, jiske antargat desh bhar main faile vyapaaree sanghathanon ne vigat do maheenon main 500 se adhik vyapaaree sammelan kar vyapaariyon ko unke vot ke mahatv ke bare main bataaya or aagaamee chunaavon main ekajute hokar matdaan karne kaa aagrah kiya
 The campaign was a huge success all over the country and now the businessmen of the country are standing with Kat and will unilaterally vote in the upcoming elections
 khandelwal ne aage kaha ki varsh 1947 main jab desh aaazaad hua tab desh main vyapaariyon kii sankhya lagbhag 30 lakh thi jo ab badhkar 7 karod se adhik ho gai he
 About 300 million people depend on merchants for their livelihood
 desh main lagbhag 42 lakh karod kaa vaarshik kaarobaar hota he, jisaki prativarsh vikaas dar lagbhag 10 pratishat he, behad afsos kii baat he ki aazaadee ke baad se congress sarkaar ne kabhi bhi gharelu vyapaar ko yojanabadd tareeke se viksit karne kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya or sadaiv koshish is baat kii rahi ki bhartiya vyapaaree videshon se aayaat hone vaali vastuon par hi nirbhar rahen
 This is the reason that today China has succeeded in capturing a large part of India's market with its products
 khandelwal ne kaha kii agaami chunaavon ko lekar vyapaaree behad sajag hai or sheeghra hi cat apana ek rashtriya charter ghoshit karegaa or jo bhi dal cat ke rashtriya charter ko lagu karne kii thos or tark sammat baat karegaa, desh ke vyapaaree ekatarfa us dal ke paksh main matdaan karenge
 This time traders will not rely only on promises
 poochtacha main khulaasa hua ki 12 veen kaksha paas vyakti kii kisi ko bhi nuksaan pahunchane kii manshaa nahin thi
 He said that Kanade would be allowed to go home after the investigation
 unhone kaha, ‘‘hamane uske mata-pita or rishtedaaron ko use ghar le jane ke liye bulaayaa he
 '' (input bhashaa se) As soon as the assembly elections in Delhi pass, the Aam Aadmi Party has campaigned to raise funds
 haalanki 30 karod ke lakshya kaa peechha kar rahi party ummid se kam chanda juta pai he
 But what will be the party's strategy to raise funds, let us tell you
 chanda nahin mila to kaise ladenge chunaav!aam aadmi party ne janata se fund lekar chunaav ladane kii nai pahal shuru kii
 Until Arvind Kejriwal became Chief Minister in the year 2013, the party got a good trend from home to abroad
 lekin kejariwal ke mukhyamantri pad se istifa dene se lekar ab saal 2015 tak, aam aadmi party kareeb 4
 It has been able to deposit only 5 crore rupees
 haalanki party ne iske liye sadak se lekar soshal media tak kai abhiyaan chalaae
 At present, the party's leader Ashutosh believes that the party has received less than expected, but he was also seen giving political consideration to this
 unhone kaha ki AAP ke paas hameshaa fund kii kami rahegi kyonki ham kaala dhan nahin lete hai, jabaki bijepi chunaavon main pani kii tarah kaala dhan bahaati he
 It is obvious that Delhi's Fiza is going to change soon in the election season, in such a situation, the party has started speeding up the campaign, along with the expedition to raise funds through lunch and dinner party at the earliest
 vidhansabha se ikattha hone vaale chande ko usee ummidavaar ke prachaar main madad di jaaegi
 Kejriwal had nominated 10 people to achieve the target of 30 crores is fighting hard
 isi silsile main khud aravind kejariwal ne # ifundhonestparty kii tarj par apane 10 jaanane waalon ko is muhim main shaamil kiya balki unhen bhi chanda dene ke liye 10 logon ko nominete kiya
 Currently, the Aam Aadmi Party is going to have a dinner party again on 9 January in Mumbai, where Arvind Kejriwal will not be there, but he will join himself on January 11 in Bangalore
 1
 In Mumbai's dinner party, the price of the plate has been kept at 20 thousand
 2
 Instead of Arvind Kejriwal, this time Somnath Bharti, Satyendra Jain and Saurabh Bhardwaj will attend a dinner party in Mumbai
 3
 TV actor Raghu will host the show in Mumbai
 4
 While in Bengaluru, Arvind Kejriwal will accompany party secretary Pankaj Gupta

 Funds will also be raised by pulling selfie after lunch party here
 aam aadmi party hameshaa se ye kahati ai he ki uske fund kii ek ek jaankaree website par uplabdh karaati he, saath hi wo virdohi partiyon par bhi ise lekar sawaal uthaati rahi he, jiske chalate AAP ne bijepi ko kanoonee notice bhi bheja tha lekin ab dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki party chande kii is jang main kitna aage bad paati he

 The upsurge in Wimbledon's third Grand Slam tournament this year continued on Wednesday, and this time it was the defending champion and third-seeded world record holder Roger Federer, after Rafael Nadal, Layton Hewitt, Maria Sharapova, Anna Ivanovich and Sarah Irani
 saat baar vimbledon main purush ekal khitaab jeet chuke roger federer ko yah jhelana padaa ukraine ke 116veen variyata praapt 27-varshiya khilaadi sargei stakhovski ke haathon, jisane federer par duusare daur main teen ghante tak khinche marathon mukaable ke dauraan 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-5), 7-5, 7-6 (7-5) se jeet hasil kii
 Roger Federer has previously reached the quarter-finals of Grand Slam tournaments for 36 consecutive times, and finished out of a Grand Slam before making it to the final eight for the first time since the 2004 French Open
 sargei stakhovski se haar jane ke baad swiss champion ne kaha, "main behad niraash hum
 
 
 Defeating at Wimbledon always feels the same, and this feeling will never change, so i have to come out of this feeling
 
 
 phir bhi itnaa zarur kahuunga ki kabhi kisi final mukaable ne bhi mujhe itnaa dukhi nahin kiya
 
 
 " haalanki roger federer ne yah daawa bhi kiya, "duusare daur main is apratyaashit haar ke baavjood main vichlit nahin hum
 
 
 It is normal to lose after reaching the quarter-finals 36 times in a row
 
 
 kaash, main or aage tak ja paata, lekin mujhe nahin lagata ki mere prashansakon ko is haar kaa shok manaane kii jarurat he
 
 
 i have moved on by forgetting it
 
 
 or jahaan tak sanyas kaa sawaal he, main abhi sanyas lene nahin ja rahaa
 
 
 i still have a few years of tennis left and i will return
 
 
 " On the other hand, he also congratulated Sergei Stakhovsky for the win and said, "I give him (sergei Stakhovsky) full credit for this victory, as he faced the pressure brilliantly
 
 
 zyaada mahatvapurn points ke dauraan vah mujhase kahin behatar khelaa
 
 
 " lekin roger federer ko lagata he ki tennis badal rahaa he
 He said, "tennis is going through a period of tremendous change and lower ranked players are beating players like Me, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray
 
 
 " On the other hand, Sergei Stakhovsky was finding it difficult to believe this victory
 17 grand slam khitaab jeet chuke or lagbhag kinvadanti ban chuke roger federer ke khilaaf jeet hasil karne kaa aashcharya sargei ke chehre par saaf dekha ja saktaa tha, jab usne kaha, "yah vastav main hua he, main yakeen nahin kar saktaa
 
 
 "comments 21 koshishon ke baad pehali baar top-10 khilaadiyon main se kisi ko haraane vaale sargei stakhovski ne yah bhi kaha, "maine apana sarvshereshth tennis khelaa, or main itnaa khush hum ki bataa bhi nahin saktaa
 
 
 "it is notable that Sergey Stakhowski plays without any coach's assistance
 apni khushi ko zaahir karte hue bhi sargei stakhovski kii baton se uskaa avishvaas aakhir tak jhalkata rahaa
 He said, "when you play Roger Federer in Wimbledon, it's like playing with two people together
 
 
 pehle aap uski chhavi ke saath muqabla karte hai, or saath hi us court main bhi khelnaa padataa he, jisamen vah aitihaasik pradarshan karata rahaa he
 
 
 So, it was a match of two, and i can't even describe it
 
 
 yah jaadu tha
 
 
 i can never play better than this
