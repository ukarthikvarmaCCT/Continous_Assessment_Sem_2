 On Monday, Congress leader Anand Sharma held a press conference along with former defense minister AK Antony
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri or rakshaamantri ne sansad ko gumraah kiya he, ye visheshadhikaar kaa hanan he
 The Congress will also give notice in the Lok Sabha regarding this
 aapako bataa den ki duusari taraf bhartiya janata party bhi is mudde par rahul gandhi ke khilaaf visheshadhikaar hanan kaa prastaav laane kii baat kah chuki he
 This notice of BJP has also reached the office of Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, although a final decision is yet to be taken on it
 unhone kaha ki 19, march 2018 ko rajyasabha main raksha rajya mantri ne ye nahin kaha ki koi bhi sikresi deal he, jiske tahat wo keemat nahin bataa sakate
 The PM and the Defense Minister have misled the country, mps will take necessary action in the House if necessary
 purv rakshaamantri eke antni ne kaha ki kai companiyon se baat ke baad disambar, 2012 main rafel ko silect kiya gaya jisamen paison kaa daam tay kiya gaya tha or 126 aircraft lene kii baat kii gai thi
 The company to which Modi government has given this deal has neither the experience of making plain aircraft nor of combat aircraft
 iske kaaran HAL ke bhi kai ejiniyaron ko apni naukari haath se ganvaani padi

 com / 6q2j6zrufy— Congress Live (@incindialive)july 23, 2018unhone aarope lagaaya ki is nai deal main kisi bhi tarah kii technology ke transfar kii baat nahin hui he
 Therefore, there is no understanding of sudden price rise
 antni ne kaha ki upie sarkaar kii deal ke anusaar, 126 main se 18 aircraft hi france main banane the baaki sabhi HAL ke dwaara bharat main banane the
 He said that when there is no secret deal, then why is the government not telling the price
 congress netaa anand sharmaane aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar ko sansad ke andar is maamle par safai deni chahie
 The PM changed the Rafale deal without consulting the Cabinet's Security Committee
 pradhanmantri ko france se lautne ke baad is deal ke bare main bataanaa chahie tha
 Anand Sharma alleged that France had sold similar aircraft Egypt and Qatar at a lower price, so the price in India became more caso
 unhone kaha ki november, 2016 main rakshaamantri ne aircraft ke daam bataae the to phir ab kyon nahin iske bare main bataaya ja rahaa he
 Let me tell you that during the debate on the no confidence motion on Friday, Congress President Rahul Gandhi had targeted the Modi government on the issue of Rafael Deal
 rahul ke nishane par sidhe taur par rakshaamantri or pradhanmantri the
 However, later Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his speech denied Rahul's allegations
 america raashtrapati baraak obama ke ypod main do hajaar geeton kaa sangrah he or isamen steewi vander or bob dilan ke clasik gane shaamil hai
 Obama said in an interview to 'rolling Stone' magazine that his ipod now has about two thousand songs and it is a great source of happiness for him
 unhone kaha ki ve shaayad ab bhi naye gaanon ke mukaable apane bachapan ke gaanon ko zyada mahatv dete hai
 According to Obama, Stevie Wonder, Bob Dillon, R&B, Miles Davis and John Coltrane still have plenty left
 ye purana sangeet he
 In response to a question, Obama said that he is not fond of Oprah but there have been days when he loved the music of Maria Kailas

 ' 9 / 11 ke baad hangaamaa machaa to usne duniya ko chakma dene ke liye apane aatankwaadi sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyyaba kaa naam badal diya
 The newly renamed jamaat-ud-dawa
 iske baad mumbai main 26 / 11 hua, to usne phir vahi khel khelaa
 Changed the name of Abki jamaat-ud-dawa and then renamed it tehreek-e-hurmat-e-rasool
 phir is par bhi pabandi lag gai, to ek nai raajnneetik party khadi kar lee 'milli muslim lig'
 The dream was to become Prime Minister of Pakistan by winning the general election
 magar ab lashkar ke chif hafiz said ke chehere se mukhauta hat gaya he
 First America had given advice to Pakistan, America first said 'hafiz'
 ab china ne kaha gudby 'moulana'
 Overall, the time has come for Pakistan to say Abhafiz Saeedko Khuda Hafiz
 kyonki pakistan ke sabase bade hamdard china ne bhi pradhanmantri shahid khakkaan abbasi se saaf lafzon main kah diya he ki is musiibat ko mulk se baahar nikaalo varanaa pachhataaoge bahut
 He is like this
 kyonki antarrashtriya dabaav main is antarrashtriya aatanki ko bina giraftaar kiye mulk main rahane dene se pakistan aisi mushkil main aa jayega kii chaahakar bhi china use is musiibat se baahar nahin nikaal paaegaa
 Now China has given advice to Pakistan, Chinese President Xi Jingping has given a sympathetic advice to Pakistan, to keep the bad image of Hafiz Saeed in the world and throw it out of the country and throw it away in a West Asia country
 needed
 china main raashtrapati shi jingping or pakistani pradhanmamantri khakkaan ke bich hui 35 minute kii mulaakaat main bharat or international agenciyon ke dabaav ko dekhte hue chini raashtrapati ne pakistani pradhanmantri ko kareeb 10 minute tak sirf hafiz said par unka dimag khol dene vaala gyaan diya
 In order to keep Saeed out of the limelight, Jingping advised Pakistan to find a way out or face the consequences soon
 ab china ne kaha gudby 'moulana'abbasi ke ek kareebi sutara ke mutabik raashtrapati shi jingping ne kaha ki chini raashtrapati shi jingping ne kaha ki kuch aise raste talaashiye jisase hafiz said ko charchaa se dur rakhaa ja sake
 Until there is no way out
 said ko kisi pashchim asian desh main chaiyn kii jindagi jeene ke liye bhej den
 Because since the Mumbai attack, it has been the target of India and global agencies
 khabar ke mutabik chini raashtrapati se baatcheet ke baad abbasi ne sarkaar kii kanoonee team se maamle main salaah lee he
 However, Hafiz's fate has not been decided yet
 raajnneetik dalon ke liye pareshaniantarrashtriya dabaav ke baad ab hafiz said kii haalat dhobi ke us gadhe jaisi ho gai he jo naa ghar kaa bachaa he naa ghat
 Because after the US ban, now Chinese advice has not left Hafiz to live in Pakistan either
 or us par sitam ye ki khud pakistani sarkaar or duusari raajnneeti partiyaan bhi nahin chaahatin ki hafiz pakistan main rahe
 Because he has formed his political party for the upcoming general election
 or wo chunaav ladane kii zid par ada hua magar abhi tak vahaan kii court or chunaav ayog se use parmishan nahin mili he
 But if the permission is received, then the populism of Hafiz in Pakistan can cause trouble for these political parties
 hafiz ne kaha- china ke ishaare par chal rahaa he pakamgar aise vakt main jab mumbai hamalon kaa mastermind mulk kaa vazeer-e-aazam banane ke khwab paal rahaa tha
 This clever move of China has disturbed all around him
 haalanki jamaat-ud-daawa sarkaar par america or bharat ke dabaav main aakar hafiz said ke khilaaf karrwai karne kaa aarope laga rahi he
 While speaking to reporters at a Rosa Iftar, Hafiz Saeed refused to believe that China wants to ban him and send him out of Pakistan
 haalanki usne ye kubul kiya ki china super power ke taur par kaam kar rahaa he or pakistan uske nirdesh par chalata he
 MML has been declared a terrorist organization
 On one hand, America has already declared Hafiz Saeed's political party, the Milli Muslim League, or MML as a foreign terrorist organization
 vahiin ab duusari taraf china ne bhi pakistan ko hafiz se chhutkaaraa paane kii salaah de di he
 Let me tell you that in the month of April this year, Hafiz Saeed's political party was included in the list of terrorist organizations
 america kii is list main milli muslim lig ke pakistan main maujuud aatankwaadi sanghathan lashkar-e-taybba or taharik-e-aazaadee-e kashmir yani taajak kaa naam bhi shaamil he
 Not only this, the US had also declared 7 members of Hafiz Saeed's political organization Milli Muslim League as foreign terrorists on behalf of lashkar-e-taiba
 hafiz par das million dollar kaa inaamahafiz par paabandiyon kaa silsilaa america par hue 9-11 hamalon ke hamalon ke baad se hi shuru ho gaya
 When Hafiz's initial organization lashkar-e-taiba was banned
 
 After this, he resumed Lashkar in the name of jamaat-ud-dawa
 magar mumbai hamale ke baad duniya bhar kii suraksha agenciyon kii najaron se bachane ke liye usne jamaat-ud-daawa yani lashkar ke majahabi chehre ko taharik-e-hurmat-e-rasul bana diya
 After this, he had formed a new organization called Milli Muslim League only to enter Pakistani politics
 lekin ye bhi ab america kii blike list main shaamil he
 Not only this, America has also placed a reward of ten million dollars or about 60 crores on its head
 gauratlab he ki narendra kashyap kii bahu kii 6 april ko sanjay nagar sthit ghar ke bathroom main sir main goli lagane par sandigdh haalat main maut ho gai thi

 Taking a jibe at the promises made by the bjp-led government at the Center, senior Congress leader Sheila Dikshit has said that in politics, lies don't last too long and 'people have started remembering the Congress now
 ’ dilli kii purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ne kaha, ‘‘
 
 
 
 ab log congress ko yaad karne lag gayi hai
 The Congress used to say or do what it said
 aisa nahin tha ki keval kahati thi
 '' unhone kaha ki aap swayan hi dekh lijie
 
 tuji, thriji sab jhootha nikal gaya
 "in politics, there is a lot of lowliness, but i believe that in politics, lies do not last long
" ’’ Referring to the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the senior Congress leader said that Prime Minister Modi is a 'speaker-spokesperson' very good
 kintu jameen par kuch nahin dikhaai detaa
 The kind of development he talks about is not visible anywhere
 bullate train, jiesti, notebandi
 
 aakhir isse hal kya hua? jiesti main logon ko abhi tak kuch samaj main nahin aa rahaa he
 Overall, the expectations were not fulfilled
 yah puche jane par ki kya congrres adhyaksh rahul gandhi ab itane paripakv ho gayi hai, ki vah congress ko behatar dhang se chalaa sake or pradhanmantri modi kaa muqabla kar saken, shila ne kaha, ‘‘bilkul ho gayi hai
 We have to understand that maturity is not such a thing that the door opened or the screw opened and it came
 yah aati he anubhav se
 They are experiencing it day by day
 or acchhee baat he ki vah iskaa phayda uthaa rahe hai
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki jis prakaar bhaajapa kii sarkaar chal rahi he or jis tarah logon kaa vishwaas uske prati kam hota ja rahaa he, congress rahulji ke netritv main jarur ubhar kar aayegi
 '' congress main bujurg peedi kii praasangikta ke sawaal par unhone kaha, ‘‘rahul gandhi pehle hi kah chuke hai vah sabko saath lekar chalenge
 We also need experience and new direction
 ’’ Asked about her thinking about the young faces in the party, Sheila said that in the last Lok Sabha, many young ministers had emerged in the government of the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 party main kai yuva log jaise jyotiraditya sindhiya, sachin payalat, randeep surajevaala aadi, bahut naye dhang se sochate hai
 He has a completely new thinking
 ab unhen kahaan or kaise istemaal kiya jaae, yah hamaare liye ek chunauti sabit hoga
 This challenge will also be met
 tippaniyan When asked about the allegations of impact on the implementation of various programs due to lack of bureaucracy from the NDA government at the center and the AAP government of Delhi, he said that we have to understand that democracy is a medium for decision making and To make policies
 unka kriyanvayan to naukarshahi ke paas hi he
 Therefore his role becomes even more important
 unhone kaha ki yadi niti-kaarykram dhang se lagu hi nahin hue to unke banane kaa hi koi matlab nahin he
 Therefore it is very important to bring the bureaucracy along
 ho saktaa he ki koi thik dhang se kaam na kar rahaa ho yaa bhrashtachar ho to aap yahaan se vahaan badal sakate hai
 Transfer takes place
 kintu desh kya, puri duniya ke liye naukarshahi bahut ahm he
 It is very important to keep it with you, to make it implement policies, right to right and wrong to wrong
 agar aap aisa nahin kar paa rahe ho to aap bahut aage nahin bad sakate
 He said that you should see for yourself
 
 Tooji, 3G all came out false
 ‘‘raajnneeti main oonch neech avashya chalati he kintu meraa yah maananaa he ki raajnneeti main jhooth der zyada nahin chalata
 '' pradhanmantri narendra modi kii sarkaar kii charchaa karte hue congress kii varisht netaa ne kaha ki pradhanmantri modi ‘vaktaa-pravaktaa’ bahut achche hai
 But nothing appears on the ground
 vah jis tarah ke vikaas kii baat karte hai, vah to kahin dikhaai nahin padataa
 Bullet train, GST, demonetisation
 
 After all, what is the solution? People are not yet understanding anything in GST

 Asked if Congress President Rahul Gandhi has become so mature now that he can run the Congress better and compete with Prime Minister Modi, Sheila said, "absolutely done
" hamen yah samajhnaa hoga ki parivakvata koi aisi cheez nahin ki darwaja kholaa yaa pech ghumaya or yah aa gayi
 It comes from experience
 unhen din prati din anubhav ho rahaa he
 And the good thing is that he is taking advantage of it
 ’’ He said, "I am confident that as the BJP government is running and the confidence of the people is decreasing towards it, the Congress will definitely emerge under Rahulji's leadership
" ’’ On the question of the relevance of the elderly generation in the Congress, he said, "rahul Gandhi has already said that he will take everyone along
 hamen anubhav bhi chahie or nayi disha bhi chahie
 '' party main yuva chehron ke bare main unki soch ke bare main poochne par shila ne kaha ki pichhali loksabhaa main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii sarkaar main kai yuva mantri ubhar kar aaye the
 Many young people in the party like Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sachin Pilot, Randeep Surjewala etc
, think in a new way
 unki ekadam nayi soch he
 Now where and how to use them, it will prove to be a challenge for us
 is chunauti ko puraa bhi kiya jayega
 The comments kendra kii rajg sarkaar or dilli kii aap sarkaar se naukarshahi ke prasann nahin hone ke chalate vibhinn kaaryakramon ke kriyanvayan par padane vaale prabhaav ke aaropon ke sambandh main sawaal kiye jane par unhone kaha ki hamen yah samajhnaa hoga ki loktantr to ek madhyam he nirnay lene or nitiyaan banane kaa
 Their execution is with the bureaucracy
 isliye uski bhoomika or bhi mahatvapurn ho jaati he
 He said that if the policies and programs are not implemented in the manner, then there is no point in their formation
 isliye naukarshahi ko saath lenaa bahut jaruri he
 Maybe someone is not working properly or there is corruption, then you can change from here to there
 tabadale hote rahete hai
 But what country, bureaucracy is very important for the whole world
 use apane saath rakhana, usase nitiyon ko lagu karwaanaa, sahi ko sahi or galat ko galat bataanaa bahut aavashyak he
 If you are not able to do this, then you cannot move forward
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii sarkaar kii charchaa karte hue congress kii varisht netaa ne kaha ki pradhanmantri modi ‘vaktaa-pravaktaa’ bahut achche hai
 But nothing appears on the ground

 At the same time, Akhilesh has 6,816,363 followers
 pehle bhi lag chuke hai chandrakala par 'daag'saal 2017 main IAS bi
 Chandrakala was a defaulter in giving details of her assets
 darasal, civil seva adhikariyon ko 2014 ke liye 15 janvari 2015 tak apni sampatti kaa record pesh karnaa tha
 But even after a year had passed, these officials had not given details of their assets
 chandakala kaa naam bhi isamen shaamil tha
 According to information from the General Administration and Training Department of the Central Government, Chandrakala's assets were just Rs 10 lakh in 2011-12
 2013-14 main yah badhkar kareeb 1 karod rupee ho gai
 That is, their wealth increased by 90 percent in one year

 But is he strict about clean elections himself? Is he respecting the code of conduct himself? When the Supreme Court was reprimanded in the past, the Commission immediately banned the propaganda of many leaders
 yogi adityanath or mayawati se lekar siddhu or aazam khan tak par pabandi lagaai gai
 But why is the commission lax on complaints against Prime Minister Modi
 9 april ko latur main pradhanmantri ne bayaan diya ki pulavama ke shaheedon ke naam kya pehali baar vot dene vaale matadaata apana vot samarpit nahin kar sakate hai
 a complaint of violation of the code of conduct has been filed against this statement, no decision has been taken till April 24
 enditivi ko pataa chalaa he ki is bhaashan ke kilaaf jo shikaayat kii gai thi, uski fil hi gaayab ho chuki he
 There is no mention of this complaint on the Election Commission website
 is website ke screenshot se pataa chalata he ki kabhi is shikaayat par 'rijolved- yani nibataya gaya- likhaa hua tha
 The Election Commission is calling it a technical glitch
 lekin do hafte ho chuke, is par ayog khamosh he
 While sources in the Election Commission have been saying that action will take place, but action does not appear to be taking place
 ulte aachaar samhita ke ulanghan ke maamle badhate ja rahe hai
 After the second phase of voting, the Commission said that only part of the Prime Minister's speech had come

 Not only this, where the complaint against Mayawati was processed within 4 days, the complaint against Maneka Gandhi, Yogi Adityanath, Navjot Sidhu was processed within 6 days, while the Prime Minister's statement has been 15 days
 karrwai kaa pataa nahin he
 The Election Commission had stated very clearly that no army action should be mentioned during the election campaign, but the Prime Minister asked for votes in the name of Pulwama's air strike
 sena kii karrwai ke is istemaal par sena ke kai purv afasaron ne raashtrapati se chitthee likhi- kaha ki sena ko raajnneeti main ghaseetna thik nahin
 But who made a difference? But this is not the only violation from the Prime Minister

 On economic grounds, the reservation bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, where it was passed with a majority
 iske baad buudhvaar ko is bill ko rajyasabha main pesh kiya gaya
 In the Rajya Sabha, the Congress opposed the decision to extend the proceedings of the House by a day
 congress netaa anand sharma ne rajyasabha main kaha, "jis tarah sadan kii kaarywahi ko vipakshi partiyon kii sahmati ke bina badhaayaa gaya, vah sahi nahin he
 
 
 Now the situation is such that there is no dialogue between the government and the opposition
 
 
 agar sadan nahin chal paa rahaa he, to uske liye sabase zyaada zimmedaari sarkaar kii he
 
 
 "union Minister Thawarchand Gehlot said that the Constitution Amendment Bill 2019 has passed with an overwhelming majority
 ummid he ki rajyasabha bhi baari bahumat se paarit karegi
 All parties and mps have been demanding that such a general class who lives poor life also get economic and educational benefits
 ye bill jaldbaaji main nahin laayaa gaya
 The Mandal Commission had also given its report in this matter and said that such class should get 10 percent reservation
 uske baad sinho kamishan ne bhi aisa prativedan diya tha
 On Monday, an agitation broke out in Parliament
 ek aisa bayaan jise saansad apana apmaan bataa rahe hai or aaj ise lekartim annake khilaaf ninda prastaav bhi pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 That is, MP and Team Anna are now face to face
 team anna ke bayaan ke baad saare ke saare dal ekajute hokar team anna par tut pade or kaha gaya ki ye loktantr kaa apmaan he
 The talk has increased so much that Sharad Yadav has spoken of an all-party resolution against Team Anna
 sharad yadav chaahate hai sadan ye prastaav laae
 But, Anna Hazare says that he does not mind any such initiative
 sansad main hangaamaa hua to sabhi dalon ne sur main sur milaayaa
 The pain of BJP is that NDA was helping Team Anna
 phir bhala use nishaanaa kyon banaaya gaya
 However, the mps who are looking at the speckled statement relate to the insult of Parliament
 wo shaayad bhul rahe hai ki unheen ke bich ke netaa na jane kitni baar saarvajanik manchon se ek duusare par gambhir aarope laga chuke hai
 The most important thing is that mps have no objection to tearing down a copy of a bill inside the House
 lokapal bill par charchaa ke liye sadan kaa kaarykaal badhaayaa jaataa he or rajyasabha ke andar argedy saansad raajnneeti prasad vidheyak kii copy faad dete hai
 The committee of the House did not take any action on the politics Prasad nor did the honorable mps make it a question of the prestige of Parliament
 saansad bavaal machaa rahe hai lekin ek shodh se mili aakadon kii gavaahi len to maujuuda loksabhaa main 162 saansadon par aapraadhik mukademe hai, yani kareeb 29
 83 percent of mps are tainted
 vahiin rajya sabha ke 242 main se 224 saansadon kii jaankaree lee gai to usamen 19 fisadi saansadon ke khilaaf aapraadhik mukademe paae gaye
 In such a situation, the question arises, how correct is the boast on the insult being said by resorting to the speckled statement? dilli uniwarsity ke north campus main ratorat vir saavarkar, subhash chandra bose or bhagat singh kii murtiyon sthapit kii gayi

 It is also understood that this incident can further worsen the situation between the soldiers on the border
 5
 There is also a question about whether this incident can be made part of the discussion at the Border Patrol Team meeting
 kyonki is baar donon desh ke javaanon ke bich aamane-saamne se takaraav hua he, balki donon taraf hi javaanon ko chotein bhi ai hai
 All these aspects are being discussed regarding the Ladakh incident

 Today is the birth anniversary of Ramdhari Singh Dinkar
 agyeya ne unke bare main kaha tha, ''unki rashtriya chetana or vyapak saanskrithik drushti, unki vaani kaa oj or kavyabhasha ke tatwon par bal, unka satvik mulyon kaa aagrah unhen parmparik reeti se jode rakhata he
 "indeed, Dinkar remained connected with the nation and nationalism all his life
 bhartiya puranic aakhyaan hon, rashtrawaad, puraana yaa kisaan, sabaki vyakhya main dinakar ke liye bharat hi sarvopari tha
 His early life was a struggle
 vah bihar ke munger jile ke simriya ghat naamak gaanv main 23 sitambar, 1908 ko paidaa hue
 Education was done at Mokama Ghat's school and then at Patna College, where he passed the BA Honors examination on the subject of history
 baad main vah ek vidhyalay ke pradhanacharya, sab-register, jansampark vibhaag main up-nideshak, bhagalpur vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati, bharat sarkaar ke hindi salaahkaar aadi vibhinn padon par rahe
 He did a lot of writing
 bhashaaon ko seekhney ke prati unki lalak behad saraahneey thi
 It is said that he had excellent knowledge of Sanskrit, English, Urdu, Bangla etc
 languages
 ve ahindibhashi janata main bhi bahut lokapriy the, kyonki unka hindi prem dusron kii apni maatrubhaasha ke prati shraddha or prem kaa virdohi nahin, balki prerak tha
 Acharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi says that Dinkar ji lived a laborious life
 unki sahitya sadhana apurv thi
 Some time ago a gentleman wrote me a letter from Calcutta saying how appropriate it is for Dinkar to receive the Jnanpith Award
 i wrote to him in reply that- if he had got four Jnanpith awards, he would have got due respect for prose, poetry, speeches and Hindi propaganda
 ramdhaari singh dinakar kii mrityu 25 april, 1974 ko hui, par isse pehle ve vividh vidhaon main bharpoor sahitya srujit kar chuke the
 He received an honorary degree of Dealit from several universities for his books and literary services
 iske alaava vah sahitya academy puraskaar tathaa gyanpith sammaan se bhi navaaje gaye
 He was awarded the title of Padma Bhushan by the Government of India
 dinakar ne prachur maatra main likhaa or ek se bad kar ek
 Be it Rashmirathi, Waiting for Kurukshetra, Hunkar or Parashurama, or four chapters of culture
 sabane hindi sahitya ko behad samrudh kiya
 But today we will talk about the literature on his birth anniversary till date, Urvashi
 prem, aadhyatm, dev or maanav kaa yah adbhut aakhyaan
 The subject is not just literature but the whole life philosophy
 dinakar keval yah rachana bhi likhte, to bhi hindi sahitya main amar ho jate
 Because of its craft and background
 urvashi kii bhoomika main likhe gaye unke shabd, maanav vikaas ke is daur main bhi shabdashah mauju he
 This poetic drama, published in the year 1961, wanted Dinkar to relate the Vedic, mythological ancient narratives of Urvashi and Pururava to a new meaning
 unki is kriti main pururava or urvashi alag-alag tarah kii pyaas lekar aaye the
 Pururava is the son of the earth and Apsara of Urvashi Devlok, who has come to the earth with female curiosity
 pururava ke bheetar devaty kii trishna he, to urvashi sahaj nishcint bhav se prithvi kaa sukh bhogana chaahati he
 Urvashi is a poem of love and beauty
 isaki bhoomika main khud dinakar likhte hai- pururava or urvashi kii katha kai roopon main milti he or uski vyakhya bhi kai prakaar se kii gayi he
 Raja Pururava is the primitive man of the Soma dynasty
 unki rajdhani prayag ke paas, pratishthanpur main thi
 It is said in the Puranas that when Manu and Shraddha desired a child, they performed a yajna with the sage Vasistha
 shraddha kii manokamana thi ki ve kanya kii mata bane, manu chaahate the ki unhen putr praapt ho
 However, a girl was born from this yajna
 peeche, manu kii niraashaa se dravit hokar vasishtha ne use putr bana diya
 This son of Manu was named Sudyumna
 yuva hone par sudyumna, ek baar, akhet karte hue kisi abhishpt van main ja nikle or shaapvash, ve yuva nar se yuvati nari ban gayi or unka naam ila ho gaya
 This ela fell in love with the newly born son of the Moon, Mercury, which resulted in Pururava
 isi kaaran, pururava ko ail bhi kehete hai or unase chalanevaale vansh kaa naam chandravansh he
 There are two hypotheses about the origin of Urvashi
 ek to yah ki jab amrit-manthan ke samay samudr se apsaraon kaa janm hua, tab urvashi bhi unheen ke saath janami thi
 Secondly, when Indra sent several apsaras to him to disturb Narayan Rishi's penance, the sage, by pushing his femur, produced a woman who was more beautiful than all those nymphs
 yahi nari urvashi hui or urvashi naam uskaa isliye padaa ki vah uru se janami thi
 Ganga also has a name Urvashi because of sitting on Bhagirath's thigh
 devi bhagwat ke anusaar, badari dham main jo devi-peeth he, use urvashi-tirth kehete hai
 The penance of nar-narayan was in Badri Dham
 sambhav he, urvashi-tirth usee kaa smarak ho
 The earliest mention of this story is found in the Rigveda
 kintu, us sookt se itnaa hi vidit hota he ki urvashi pururava ko chhodkar chali gayi thi or virahonmatta pururava uske sandhan main the
 One day when Urvashi met her, she told that she was pregnant, but she refused to return and stay with him again
 peeche chalakar, shatapath brahman main or, uske aadhaar par, puraanon main is katha kaa jo pallavan hua, usamen kaha gaya he ki urvashi ke garbh se pururava ke chah putr hue the, jinamein sabase bade kaa naam aayu tha
 It is said that according to Nirukta, age also means man
 is drushti se, manu or ida tathaa pururava or urvashi, ye donon hi kathaayen, ek hi vishay ko vyanjit karti hai
 The process of creation-development, which depicts the duty-side, is the narrative of Manu and Ida, the spirit-aspect of that process is stated in the story of Pururava and Urvashi
 sar wiliam vilson ne anumaan lagaaya tha ki pururava-urvashi kii katha anyoktiparak he
 The real hero of this tale is Surya and the heroine Usha
 in donon kaa milan kuch hi kaal ke liye hota he; baad main, ve prati din bichhud jate hai
 But, in taking this story, it was not my intention to reiterate the Vedic narrative or to revert to the Vedic context
 meri drushti main pururava sanathan nar kaa pratik he or urvashi sanathan nari kaa
 The word Urvashi will have a corporeal meaning ardent desire, infinite lust, desire or desire
 or pururava shabd kaa arth he- vah vyakti jo naanaa prakaar kaa rav kare, naanaa dhvaniyon se akraant ho
 Urvashi symbolizes the wishes of the eye, eye, olfactory, dermal and uterine; a human being aroused by the pleasures of the form, juice, smell, touch and word
 pururava dwandv main he, kyonki dwandv main rahanaa manushya kaa swabhaav he
 Man also desires happiness and attempts to get beyond it
 nari nar ko chhukar trupt nahin hoti, na nar nari ke aalingan main santosh maanata he
 There is a power that does not allow the woman to remain separate from the male and the male from the female, and even when they are found, still, they carry within them a desire, whose fulfillment is unavailable on the surface of the body
 nari ke bheetar ek or nari he, jo agochar or indriatit he
 This woman finds the man when the stream of the body, bouncing, throws her into the sea of mind, when, beyond the carnal consciousness, it reaches into the inaccessible trance of love and becomes sullen
 or purush ke bheetar bhi ek or purush he, jo sharir ke dharaatal par nahin rahata jisase milane kii akulata main nari ang-sangya ke paar pahunchnaa chaahati he
 The lovers, bound in the beginning-loop, by transcending each other, want to reach a world that is kirojjaval and pneumatic
 indriyon ke maarg se atindriya dharaatal kaa sparsh, yahi prem kii aadhyatmik mahima he
 Yoga is a way to get out of the boundary of country and time, but its other path also comes out from within male-female-love, this estimate of man is very ancient
 tantra-sadhana ke mul main aisa koi-na-koi vishwaas rahaa hoga; sahajamargiyon ke man main aisi koi-na-koi bhaavana kaam karti hogi; abhinav manovigyaan ke bheetar bhi aisi koi-na-koi prerana kriyasheel he
 Psychology narrates these formless tantrums of sexual pleasure in the language of sublime
 prem kii ek udattikrut sthiti vah bhi he jo samadhi se milti-julati he
 Whose personality has developed devopam, whose neurological strings are conscious and alive, and whose mind is, by nature, upward and avid, one can realize this samadhi by the mere touch of work
 tatparisparshasukhyan paramanubhavti sachchidanandarupamtatrasit varanbhinna ramarantirpe: yoganidraan gatev
 The symbol of this aspiration to open the eyes of the duality of the human being, rising from the realization and the sensuality of moving from the real to the formless, is the beginning of opening the eyes in the imperceptible world
 kintu, urvashi dvandvon se sarvatha mukt he
 Goddesses do not have conflict, they are trivial, unblemished and sinless
 dvandvon kii kuch thodi, anubhuti unhen tab hoti he, jab vah mata athwa purna maanvi ban jaati hai, jab mitti kaa ras unhen purna rup se abhisikt kar detaa he
 Emotion and logic, heart and brain, art and science or aimless joy and purposive cultivation, these pairs of human qualities are visible even to the new human and they were visible to the ancient human as well
 manu or ida kaa aakhyaan tark, mastishk, vigyaan or jivan kii soddeshy sadhana kaa aakhyaan he; vah purusharth ke arth-paksh ko mahatva detaa he
 But the narrative of pururava-urvashi is a narrative of the glory of spirit, heart art and aimless joy; He explains the importance of the work-side of effort
 jaise purusharth ke teen ang kahe gayi hai, vaise hi, manushya ke aantarik vyaktitv ke dharaatal bhi teen he
 All the personality of a human being is the basis of the whole life of his bio-emotions
 yah vah dharaatal he, jis par manushya or pashuon main bhed nahin he or yahi dharaatal sab se prabal or sabase pracheen bhi he
 Two levels of intellect and soul, which distinguish man from animals, were born later
 vaise aatma to pashuon main bhi he, kintu sadasad vivek kii shakti, jo maanavtaa kaa pradhan gun he, pashuon main nahin hoti
 But in the same amount of intelligence that man has gained, he has lost the power of instinct which is called Instinct in English
 tab bhi, buddhi thodi pashuon main bhi he or sahaj pravriti, kabhi-kabhi, manushya main bhi jhalak maarthi he
 The difference is that the whole life of the animal goes on with a natural instinct, only a slight frill of wisdom exists along its side
 or manushya ke saare jivan kaa aadhaar buddhi he, sahaj pravriti, kabhi-kabhi hi, bijli kii tarah usamen kaundh jaati he
 Nevertheless, the best poems of man are indicated by the supreme philosophy and the invention of science, these all-encompassing, which can be called intuition, which is very similar to instinct
 arth or kaam, ye jaev dharaatal ke purusharsh hai, kintu dharm kaa janm aatma ke dharaatal par hota he
 Wisdom is the servant and assistant of both these landowners
 kintu, arth kii seva vah jis sahajata se karti he, usee sahajata se vah dharm or kaam kii seva nahin kar sakati
 There are tools of meaning, food, food, motor, palace, army, society, and all the physical campaigns of man, which fall in the circle of intelligence
 kintu, kaam ke ang kala, suruchi, soundaryabodh or prem hai, jo, mukhyat: sambuddhi se sankethik hote hai
 Similarly, intelligence does not prove religion either
 dharm baraabar sambuddhi se prerana paata he
 Religion is born on the surface of the soul, but its significance is when it comes to the surface and affects our behavior
 kala, suruchi, soundaryabodh or prem, inkaa janm jaev dharaatal par hota he, kintu, sarthakata unki tab siddh hoti he, jab ve upar uthakar aatma ke dharaatal kaa sparsh karte hai
 Rati, anger, fear and hatred are among the nine basic expressions of literature, these basic expressions also occur in buffalo, but in animals, the expressions which are uncouth and ugly, have changed to many colors in humans, Because man has the power of intelligence and imagination, which is not in animals
 pashuon main jo prerana ritu-dharm se ekaakaar he, manushyon main vah ritu-dharm kaa bandhan nahin maanati, na vah prajasrishti kii seemaa par samaapt hoti he
 kama-shakti is in the range of need and use in animal world
 manushya main aakar vah aise anand kaa kaaran ban gayi he jo nishprayojan, nissim or niruddeshy he
 She regularly creates new drivers, gives birth to new fantasies and keeps a human being guided by new memories
 yah sach he ki kaam ke kshetra main pashuon ko jo swadhinata praapt he, vah manushyon ko nahin he
 However, the eternal spread of sexual gratification, inspirations and pleasures in humans cannot occur in imaginary animals
 or manushya main bhi jo log pashutaa se jitani dur hai, ve kaam ke sookshm sukhon kaa swaad utana hi adhik jaanate hai
 The prevalence of sexual motivation has reached far within civilization and culture
 yadi koi yuvak kisi yuvati ko prashansa kii ankhon se dekh le, to duusare hi din se us yuvati ke haav-bhav badalane lagate hai, use poshaak or prashaadhan main naveenta kii aavashyaktaa anubhoot hone lagati he, uske bolne, chalane or dekhne main ek nayi bhangima utpann ho jaati he
 And, similarly, when a woman looks at a man with an appreciative vision, then a fanciful person wakes up within the unconscious person, a poem starts to smell, a beauty wish is awakened and takes her to the mirror
 is
 kaam kii ye jo niraakaar jhankrutiyaan hai, ve hi udaattikaran ke sookshm sopan hai
 The introduction of beauty by skin, touch, is incomplete and incomplete
 purnataa par vah tab pahunchataa he, jab ham soundarya ke nididhyasana athwa samadhi main hote hai
 In art, literature and, especially, poetry, beyond physical beauty indicates post-natal beauty, the physical becomes 'meta-physical'
 prem main bhi bhoot se upar uthakar bhutarottar hone kii shakti hoti he, rup ke bheetar dub kar arup kaa sandhan karne kii prerana hoti he
 Even in its grossest form, love is the easiest, most natural way for a human to be united with another human being; But, when developed and sublime, it gives a lot of coolness to man, which is the contribution of religion
 dharmadartho arthat: kaam: kamadharm-faloday:
 - Padmapuran
 dharm se arth or arth se kaam kii prapti hoti he, kintu, kaam se phir hamen dharm ke hi fal praapt hote hai
 All those who sleep in life with subtle joy and aimless happiness, they, somewhere or other, erupt from the mountain of work
 jiskaa kaam kunthit, upekshit athwa avaruddha he, vah anand ke anek sookshm roopon se vanchit rah jaataa he
 Hein is not the only one who has only caught the meaning except religion and work; Justly, the seeker should also say to the seeker, who is fighting with both the meaning and the work in the pursuit of righteousness
 dharmarthkaaman sammev sevyan,ya: eksevi sa naro jaghanya:pururava or urvashi kaa prem maatr sharir ke dharaatal par nahin rukta, vah sharir se janm lekar man or praan ke gahan, guhya lokon main pravesh karata he, ras ke bhautik aadhaar se uthakar rahasy or aatma ke antariksh main vicharan karata he
 There is a desire for divinity within Pururava
 isliye, martya lok ke naanaa sukhon main vah vyakul or vishann he
 Urvashi is a woman descended from heaven
 vah sahaj, nishcint bhav se prithvi kaa sukh bhogana chaahati he
 The anguish of Pururava is sounded by the perpetual anguish of the entire human race
 kintu, maanavtaa kii yah vednaa utpann kahaan se hoti he? maanav-man kaa yah du:saadhy sangharsh aata he kahaan se?aatma kaa dharaatal manushya ko upar khinchataa he or jaev dharaatal kaa aakarshan neeche kii ore he
 This anguish happened to him when he began to separate from the animals
 maanavtaa hi manushya kii vednaa kaa uttam naam he
 He is unable to measure himself from the yard of what humans have imagined of gods
 yadi manushya apni gardan tanakar mastak se nakshatron ko chune kaa prayaas kare, to uske paanv jameen se ukhd jate hai, vah vaayu main nissahay udne vaala patta ban jaataa he
 And if he remains standing on the earth with his feet raised, then what constellation can he touch with his head, he cannot even touch the grass of ordinary trees
 manushya kii kalpana kaa devtaa vah he, jo jal main utarane par bhi jal se nahin bheengta, jisaki gardan, samudr kii oonchi-se-oonchi laharon se bhi haath bhar oonchi dikhaai detii he
 But man's fate is not like this
 vah tarangon se ladate-ladate bhi unase bhing jaataa he or bahudhaa lehren use baha kar aughat ghat main phenk detii hai, bhavar kaa jaal banakar use neeche pataal main gaad detii hai
 Still, it is human nature to struggle
 vah jal ke samaan surya kii kirnon par chadhakar akaash pahunchataa he or badalon ke saath prithvi par laut aata he
 And the rays of the sun, once again, take him to the sky
 swarg or prithvi ke bich ghatit is nirantar avaagaman se manushya kaa nistaar kabhi hoga yaa nahin, iskaa vishwasaneey gyaan naye manushya ko chhodkar chalaa gaya he
 That is why i am silent about what happened to him when Pururava went away with retirement
 ek ore devatv kii oonchi-oonchi kalpanaaen; duusari ore upanate hue rakt kii apratihat pukaar or pag-pag par gheranevaali thos vaastaviktaa kii abhedya chattaane, jo hukum nahin maanatin, jo pighalanaa nahin jaanateen
 The man eats tremors between the two ends of the wind and the stone, and after being jerked, sometimes turns to this side, and sometimes to that side
 kabhi prem! kabhi sanyas!or sanyas prem ko bardaasht nahin kar saktaa, na prem sanyas ko, kyonki prem prakruti or parameshwar sanyas he or manushya ko sikhalaayaa gaya he ki ek hi vyakti parameshwar or prakruti, donon ko praapt nahin kar saktaa
 Urvashi asks, "is God and Nature two? Is God a force of nature, a competitor of this? Can't both walk together? Is nature born as an enemy of God? Or is God only enraged by nature? Nature And a feeling of unity of God, a tableau of balance between sannyas and love, is reflected in the character of Maharishi Chyavan
 jo nadi pururava ke bheetar baichaiyn hokar garaj rahi he, vahi chyavan main aakar svachh, susthir, sheethal or maun he
 As difficult as it is to avoid samsara, to fall in love and to renounce in love, the balance between sannyas and love is, perhaps, a much harder task
 manovigyaan jis sadhana kaa sanket dene laga he, vah vairaygy nahin, raagon se maitri kaa sanket he; vah nishedh nahin, sweekruti or samanvay kaa sanket hai; vah sangharsh nahin, sahaj, svachh, prakritik jivan kii sadhana he
 The deity is not the one who is running away, giving everything back
 devtaa vah he, jo sari aasaktiyon ke bich anasakt he, sari spruhaaon ko bhogate hue bhi nisprih or nirlypt he
 Same thing again! Walk on water, do not stain water
 kintu, pani par chalakar bhi pani ke daag se bachataa koun he ?kya vah, jo oushinari or sukanya ke saath he ? athwa vah bhi, jo urvashi ke prem main he ?kya vah, jo chyavan kii patni he ? athwa vah bhi, jo pururava kii god main he ?prashnon ke uttar, rogon ke samaadhaan manushyon ke netaa diya karte hai
 The land of poetry knows only pain, knows only restlessness, only recognizes the wave of lust and the rapture of blood
 or vednaa kii bhoomi chunki pururava ke sanyas par samaapt nahin hui, isliye, oushinari kii vyathaa ne kavita ko vahaan samaapt hone nahin diya
 But, i have also said one thing as a leader
 jab devi sukanya yah sochati hai ki nar-nari ke bich santulan kaise laayaa jaae, tab unke munh se yah baat nikal padati he ki yah sristi, vastav main, purush kii rachana he
 Therefore, the Creator sided with men, filling them with self-denying tendencies
 kintu, purushon kii rachana yadi naariyaan karne lagen, to purush kii kathorta jaati rahegi or vah adhik bhavapranav evam mradulata se yukt ho jayega
 On this, the age claims that i am the man who the women have created
 aayu kaa kahana thik tha
 And he was also the famous king, which is mentioned in the Rigveda
 kintu, ullekh is baat kaa bhi he ki yuvak raja sushrava ne aayu ko jitkar use apane adheen kar liya tha
 Then the same thing! If a man is created by a man, then it is a tragedy; And if a woman is composed by a man, then he loses in battle
 samasya yuddh kii ho athwa prem kii, kathinaaiyaan sarvatra samaan hai
 In solitude, no one believes wearing a bagkha is a good thing
 kintu, baahar aate hi har koi use pahananaa chahta he, kyonki or log baghnakhe pahane hue hai
 Tip says that wearing a mask and hiding the real face will not increase virtue
 phir bhi, har aadmi naqaab lagaataa he, kyonki naqaab pahane bina ghar se nikalne kii, samaaj kii ore se, manaahi he
 But, i did not say anything on that inspiration, who had written this poem to me after suffering for eight years
 akathaneey vishay !shaayad apane se alag karke main use dekh nahin saktaa; shaayad, vah alikhit rah gayi; shaayad, vah is pustak main vyaapt he

 dekhen laaj shame sang kaa video: There is hardly any fan of non vegetarian food in the country who has not heard the name of Tunde Kebab of Lucknow
 kisi non vegeterian kaa duusare shahar se lakhanu janaa ho to uski khwaahish tunde kababi kii dukaan par jaakar vahaan parose jane vaale paratha-kebab kaa jaayaka lene kii hoti he
 Tunde Kabbi has two shops in Lucknow - one in Aminabad and the other in Akbari Gate area of chowk
 'tunde kababi' ke kareeb 100 saal ke itihaas main buudhvaar ko ye pehla mauka tha ki ye dukaan gosht kii supplai naa hone kii vajah se band rahi
 'aaj Tak' reached the old shop at Akbari Gate on Thursday, the shop was open, but kebabs of chicken and mutton were being found there
 dukaan ke maalik rais ahamed jinhen sab haji sahab ke naam se bulaate hai, unase baat kii gai to unhone bataaya ki shaadi-maut yaa tyoharon ko chhod den to buudhvaar ko aisa pehali baar hua ki dukaan band rahi
 He said that the meat of big (buffalo) could not be supplied due to the slaughtering of slaughterhouses
 guuruuvaar ko dukaan khuli to paraathon ke saath sirf chikan or matan ke hi kebab bikate dikhe
 Four mutton kebabs and two parathas were sold for Rs 70
 vahiin chikan ke chaar kebab or do parathen 50 rupee main
 Rais Ahmed said that parathas are being sold for 5 rupees as before
 lekin bade kaa kebab 2 rupee main bechaa jaataa tha to ab chikan-matan ke kebab kii keemat chaar se paanch guna baith rahi he
 According to Rais Ahmed, the size of the kebab has also had to increase earlier
 dukaan main maujuud rais ahamed ke bhaanje ne bataaya ki aam dinon kii tulana main bikri 10 fisadi hi rah gai he
 He wants to appeal to the Chief Minister to find a way to save the tradition of this Mughlai dish, which is considered the flavor of Awadh
 jahaan tak tunde kebab ke itihaas kii baat he to isaki shuruyaat 115 saal pehle muraad ali ne shuru kii thi
 This tradition has been giving people the taste of tunde kebab from generation to generation
 rais ahamed bataate hai ki tunde kebab ke khaas jaayke ke peeche masaalon kaa sikret he
 The amount of spice to be mixed is what makes the Tunde Kebab special
 'aaj tak' ne chowk ilaake main hi haleem khichde kaa stall lagane vaale shamsuddin se bhi baat kii

 He told that so far only one customer has visited his shop during the day

 sharir or chehre ko sidhaa rakhte hue photo len

 Neither eye, nor sunglasses
 - koshish karen ki peeche kii diwaar par chaaya naa pade
 So stand away from the wall some distance
 - chehre par bhi chaaya nahin banani chahie
 For this, avoid direct bright light
 - sambhav ho to natural lite main photo len, jisamen flash kaa istemaal naa karnaa pade
 - If you have to use flash, then avoid direct flash in the eyes, so that there is no problem of red eye (eyes appear red in the photo)
 - sir dhanka hua nahin ho
 Remove the cap, muffler
 aakhen saaf dikhni jaruri hai
 - If there is no expression on the face, it is good
 zyada hansate hue photo nahin len
 Now take two to three photos so that the best photo of your choice can be selected

 video-'france ke purv raashtrapati ke bayaan main virodhabhas' All the political parties are making promises to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi
 votaron ko aise sapane dikhaae ja rahe hai, maano dilli nigam chunaav ke baad shanghai ban jaaegi
 Perhaps for the first time when the politics of a municipal corporation election is being seen on the political issues of a Lok Sabha election
 haalanki jamini hakeekat yahi he ki kisi bhi rajya main nigamon kii pehali or sabase badi jimmedaari he shahar ko saaf rakhana
 In Delhi, many agencies are responsible for different work, due to which disputes often arise and this is why one agency keeps on blaming the other for its work
 duusare nagar nigamon kii tarah hi dilli main bhinagar nigamaki sabase badi jimmedaari he rajdhani ko saaf rakhana kooda kachra hataanaa or shahar ko bimariyon se bachaana
 For more than 10 years, the Bharatiya Janata Party ruled the Municipal Corporation of Delhi
 ab chunaav sar par he isliye bijepi phir sapane dikhaa rahi he, lekin jameen par pichley 10 saalon main saaf safai kii pole ho tasviren khol rahi hai, jisamen sadak par failaa kooda dilli ko bimariyon kaa adda bana rahaa he
 The BJP government at the center started the Swachh Bharat campaign, but in our reality check, the same thing came out that the bjp-ruled Municipal Corporation has made Delhi a garbage dump
 nigam kii saaf-safai kii daavon kii padtaal karne ke liye hamane reality check kii shuruyaat purvi dilli ke mayur vihaar phase van se kii
 Found here scattered on the road, full of garbage, stink and flies
 saaf safai ke reality check ke liye doosraa padaav tha mayur vihaar ke paas chilla gaanv
 Rajveer Singh, a local resident, says that cleanliness is not there and that it is difficult for people to live due to this garbage
 shikaayat karen bhi to karen kisase koi sunwaayee hi nahin hoti
 Aaj Tak's team reached Kalyan Puri after this to know the reality of cleanliness in Delhi
 do tihaai dilli kii garib janata kii tarah yahaan badi kothiyaan nahin hai, lekin ek badi aabaadi he jo har chunaav main raajnneetik dalon ke liye vot bank to banati he, lekin unki jarurat par sunne vaala koi nahin hota
 There are so many complaints with the Municipal Corporation, but lice do not creep on the ears of the corporation
 in galiyon main kooda-kachra machhar makkhiyaan or badboo aasapaas ke logon ke liye roj kii baat he
 People of the area are very angry because of this mess
 na inhen pataa he ki shikaayat kaise karen, naa nigam ne kabhi inaki sud lee
 The top garbage is picked up in the name of Khanapurti and the lower garbage becomes the fate of the people of Kalyan Puri
 realty check ke liye aglaa padaav tha kalyaan puri main nigam kaa dhalaav ghar
 Back that the road leading to the residential area was buried in a garbage dump
 camera dekha to ummiden lagaaein log shikaayatein lekar aa gaye
 Which corporation does not hear the same old complaint
 logon kii shikaayat thi ki is kooday ke chalate bimariyon ne logon ko gher rakhaa he
 While talking, an employee of the corporation also came forward, who himself has become a victim of neglect of the corporation itself
 haal hi main machharon ke pehle prakope se chikangunia ho gaya
 He also seems to believe that there is no hearing in the Municipal Corporation, due to which a pile of Delhi garbage has been formed
 dilli kii teenon hi partiyaan jor shor se prachaar kar rahi hai
 The office of Manoj Mehra, BJP candidate for corporator from Kalyan Puri, is right in front of a slump of municipal waste
 jab inase sawaal poocha ki saaf safai kyon nahin he, to netaji kaa pehla jawaab tha ki ravivaar kii chuttee he or safai karmchaaree nahin aae
 When asked how the picture would change if the BJP came to power again, Netaji said that the Prime Minister has assured that you will be given such direct to the corporations

 mikel ne kaha, 'mujhase kaha gaya tha ki agar maine yah baat kisi ko bataai, to wo mere pita ko maar denge

 At first it seems as if someone has slapped, but the very next moment the face gets drenched with blood
 dilli ke uttar-purvi ilaake main shuukravaar raat log gharon se baahar aakar us anjaane saae ke bare main baat kar rahe the jo peeche se waar karata he
 Actually, this fear is that of a serial bladebaz
 chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki uske saath ek ladki bhi hoti he, jo apana cheharaa chhupaati he or blade se waar kar bhaag jaati he
 The special thing is that every person injured by his attack is young

 ravi ne bataaya ki bladebaj ladkaa medium kad vaala tha or usne genes or tishart pahana rakhaa tha jabaki uske saath jo ladki thi usne nakaab odh rakhaa tha
 However, at present, the couple is absconding, while the people are in a panic
 logon se lekar police tak ke man main is vaardaat ko lekar kai sawaal hai, yani aisa karne ke peeche kya makasad he? kya donon kisi baat se naaraaz hai? aakhir ladakon ko hi nishaanaa kyon banaaya ja rahaa he? or bhi bahut kuch, lekin police maun he or chaanbin jari he
 Amid reports of leakage of Aadhaar data, the government is preparing to make strong arrangements for its security
 iske tahat yuidiai har aadhaar card kii ekvirtual iditaiyar karne kaa mauka degi
 With this, whenever you need to give your Aadhaar details somewhere, you will have to give a virtual ID of 16 numbers instead of 12 digit Aadhaar number
 yuidiai ke mutabik virtual idi janaret karne kii yah suvidha 1 june se anivaary ho jaaegi
 The facility will come from March 1, UIDAI has said that this facility will come from March 1
 haalanki 1 june se yah anivaary ho jaaegi
 This means that from June 1, it will be mandatory for all agencies to make arrangements to implement it
 iske baad koi bhi agency virtual idi sweekaar karne se inkaar nahin kar sakati he
 Access to Aadhaar data will not be limited as per UIDAI
 isse sambandhit agenciyon ko bhi aadhaar detail kii acces nahin hogi
 These agencies will also be able to handle everything on the basis of virtual ID only
 yuidiai ne virtual idi (VID) kii jo vyavastha laai he, iske tahat yujar jitani baar chaahe utani baar virtual idi janaret kar sakegaa
 This ID will only be valid for some time
 iske saath hiyuaidiiye suvidha bhi degaa ki aap khud apana virtual idi janaret kar saken
 In this way, you can choose a number of your choice and hand it over to the front agency
 isse na sirf aapaki aadhaar detail surakshit rahegi, balki aap apane mobile number kii tarah is idi ko bhi aasaani se yaad rakh sakenge
 After the introduction of limited KYC virtual ID, every agency can do the work of Aadhaar verification easily and paperless
 sabase acchhee baat yah hogi ki vah aapke aadhaar number tak to nahin pahunch paaenge, lekin isse judaa har kaam puraa kar sakenge
 Agencies will be divided into two categories UIDAI will divide all agencies into two categories
 isamen ek sthaneey or duusari vaishvik shrenee hogi
 Out of these, only global agencies will have access to EKYC with Aadhaar number
 vahiin, duusari taraf sthaneey agesiyon ko simit kevaisi kii suvidha milegi
 The token will be issued stating that UIDAI will issue a token for every Aadhaar number
 is token kii badaulat hi agenciyaan aadhaar detail ko veriphai kar sakenge
 This token number will be different for every Aadhaar number

 It's a thing so rare to take birth in a family that goes down in history because of the craft, hardwork, talent & relentless spirit of one man
 i feel blessed to be grandson to a legendary grandfather, a human being par excellence and an artist who the world celebrates
 We grandchildren lovingly called him 'dadu'
 Our granddad fit the bill of a ‘complete man' to the tee
 His paternalistic nature won hearts
 He was all inclusive
 He loved, cared for & helped all those he came in touch with
 He was the ultimate father figure
 He claimed that the best days of his life were not the days that won him praise or awards but the days his grand children were born
 He doted on us
 He'd spend time with us, playing, photographing every smile that flashed on our faces & videographed every little nuance of ours
 He'd even record every new word we spoke when we were learning to talk babies
 We miss you dadu
 Thank you for being you and thank you for blessing and guiding us everyday
 i know you are with us - i can feel your presence

 He wrote, It was very difficult for him to dance at the age of 75 years

 Actress Shruti Haasan always wanted to come to the cinema, but she was afraid to face the camera
 unhen lagata tha ki abhinetri banane ke liye unka cheharaa paryaapt khubasurat nahin he
 Shruti is the daughter of veteran actor Kamal Haasan and actress Sarika
 tippaniyan Shruti said, "I always wanted to be an actress, but i used to think that i am not beautiful
 main hameshaa dhoop main yahaan vahaan bhaagti-phirti rahati thi or sochati thi ki heroine to itani khubasurat hoti hai, main kaise khubasurat ho sakati hum
 But i always wanted to come to the cinema
 main abhinay karnaa chaahati thi or gayika bananaa chaahati thi
 " shruti ne film 'lack' se bollywood main kadam rakhaa tha, or ab jald hi unki do or filmein 'di de' or 'ramaiya vasta vaiyaa' pradarshit hone vaali hai
 She says that she is happy that both her upcoming films are based on different themes and her character is quite different from each other
 shruti ne kaha, "main hameshaa se ek abhinetri bananaa chaahati thi, lekin mujhe lagata tha ki main khubasurat nahin hum
 i used to run around here and there in the sun and think that heroines are so beautiful, how can i be beautiful
 lekin man main hameshaa cinema main aane kii khwaahish thi
 i wanted to act and become a singer
 " Shruti had made her Bollywood debut with the film 'luck', and now two more films 'D Day' and 'ramaiya Vasta Vaiya' are going to be released soon
 vah kahati hai ki vah is baat se khush hai ki unki aane vaali donon filmein alag-alag vishyon par aadhaarit hai or unka kirdaar ek-duusare se kaaphi alag he

 flipcart ke big billian de cell ne surkhiyaan to batori, lekin ye cell jitna safal rahaa usase zyada sawaalon main bhi rahaa
 Flipkart did not stand the trust of customers even after selling goods worth about 600 crores
 out of stock product ne logon kaa gussa badha diya or yah gussa soshal netwarking cites par flipcart ke pej par dekhne ko bhi mila
 In the end, the head of the company issued a proper mail and apologized to the people
 haalaaki cell kii duniya main flipcart ke saath kai or companiyaan bhi tezi se graahakon ko khinch rahi hai
 Snapdeal also managed to sell products worth about 600 crores on the day of Flipkart's Big Billion Day Sale
 aamejan, i-be jaisi companiyaan nae−nae tareeke graahakon ko khinchne ke liye apana rahi hai
 On Amazon's Appinance Day, there was a chance of a sale for the users of the app, and the company also announced a lot of rewards, while on Snapdeal's Savings Day, there were reports of website crashes
 yani logon main online cell kaa jaadu barkaraar he, lekin bada sawaal saakh kaa he, jiske dam par hi online bazaar main bana rahaa ja saktaa he
 Technically, there is no direct online retail business in India
 ye internet par un companiyon ke portal muhaiyaa karaati hai jo apana product bechnaa chaahati hai
 The question then arises whether the big online companies are serious about quality checks and the product reaching the customers safely
 kyonki jab khabar aati he ki mobile ke order par sabun bhej diya jaataa he, to sawaal uthanaa jaays he
 This is the situation when only 15 people still use internet connection in this country and the online retail market share is less than one percent of the total retail market
 aisa nahin he ki pehle online saamaan uplabdh nahin tha, lekin logon kaa bharosa us had tak nahin tha, jitna aaj he
 If the product you see will not be found or its quality will not be good
 to phir graahakon ko rokna bahut mushkil hoga, yani jo dikhegaa vahi milegaa tabhi online saamaan bikega or tabhi i−commers bazaar tikega

 The Goa Police has started an investigation against editor Tarun Tejpal, who sexually harassed Tehelka's female journalist twice
 police jald hi tarun ko poochtacha ke liye saman bhejegi
 In the second week of November, the Goa Police has started a footage of the hotel where Tarun Tejpal sexually abused a woman journalist during Tehelka's Prom Promise 2013
 goa ke mukhyamantri manohar parrikar ne aaj tak se baatcheet main kaha kaha ki police ko nirdesh de die gaye hai, jaanch hogi or agar shikaayat sahi pai gai, to kanoon sammat karrwai kii jaaegi
 Manohar made it clear that even though the woman journalist does not complain to the police, action will still be taken because it is directly a crime in which the police can take cognizance
 mahila ayog bhi kar saktaa he maamle kii jaancharashtriya mahila ayog (encidblyoo) ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki samachar patrika tahalaka ke mukhya sampadak tarun tejpal dwaara ek mahila patrkaar ke saath kathith yon utpeedan kaa maamla yadi unke samaksh uthaaya jaataa he, to vah maamle kii jaanch karegaa
 Mamta Sharma, chairperson of the Women's Commission, said, "once the matter is brought to the National Commission for Women, we will investigate and ensure that if the accused is found guilty, she should be punished
" use adaalat main pesh hona padegaa
 On the announcement of Tejpal resigning from the post of Tehelka's editor-in-chief for six months, Sharma said, "tarun Tejpal is not God, who will decide his own punishment
" 'mahila patrkaar ne bhi ek news channel se baatcheet main kaha ki vah is puure prakaran par tahalaka ke sheersh netritv kii pratikriya se behad niraash he
 He also said that Tehelka's other colleagues were only told about Tarun Tejpal's reaction
 meri shikaayat ke bare main vistaar se nahin bataaya gaya
 Significantly, when a female journalist complained of sexual harassment by Tehelka editor Tarun Tejpal, Tarun withdrew himself from the magazine's editing for six months after apologizing
 iske baad bhi har jagah unki aalochana ho rahi he or un par kanoonee karrwai kii maang bhi
 The basis of this demand is the mail that the victim sent to her managing editor and is now circulating in the cyber world
 iskaa javaabi mail bhi khub share kiya ja rahaa he
 To this day, we are telling the readers the essential parts of both these mails
 kya likhaa mahila patrkaar ne apane shikayati mail mendier shoma (tahalaka kii prabandh sampadak)mere liye tumhen ye email likhnaa behad takalifdeh he
 What i am going to say, how to say it in a simple way, it was busy thinking, but this is the only way to understand
 pichley saptaah tahalaka ke editor in chif tarun tejpal ne think ke dauraan do baar meraa yon utpeedan kiya
 When he did this for the first time, i wanted to call you immediately
 yaa phir tumhen aayojan sthal par khojkar aamane saamne ye bataati ki tarun ne mere saath kya kiya he
 But at that time, you were badly busy in organizing the Think
 mujhe pataa tha ki us vakt ek minute ke liye bhi ye mumkin nahin tha ki main akele main tumhen is harakat ke bare main bataa paati
 Apart from this, i was shocked that this disgusting act was done by Tarun Tejpal
 vahi tarun, jo mere pita ke saath kaam kar chuke hai, unke dost hai
 The same Tarun, whose daughter is my friend
 vahi tarun jinaki main itane saalon se unke kaam ke chalate izzat karti rahi hum
 Tarun sexually abused me twice
 har baar main buree tarah hataash or post hokar apane kamare main lauti or vahaan kaanpate hue roti rahi
 After this i went to my co-workers' room and called a senior colleague and told them everything about it
 jab duusari baar tarun ne meraa yon utpeedan kiya, to maine unki beti ko is bare main shikaayat kii
 When his daughter answered this question with Tarun, he shouted at me
 puure think festival ke dauraan main tarun se bachati rahi
 Only when there were many people present around them
 ye silsilaa tab tak chalaa, jab tak yah fest khatm nahin ho gaya
 On Saturday evening, he sent me a rude SMS, in which i wrote that i misunderstood the drunkenness of a drunkard and took the opposite meaning
 magar ye sach nahin he
 No one sexually assaultes anyone during a dullagi
 mere unki harakat kaa har byora aapako bhej rahi hum, taaki aapako samaj aae ki mere liye ye kitna takalifdeh rahaa hoga
 It must have been difficult to tell you about the incident that happened to you
 or kitna jaruri he tahalaka ke liye vishakha nirdeshon ke mutabik ek anti sexual herracement cell bananaa
 i want this cell to investigate this issue
 or aakhir main main tarun tejpal se likhit main maafee chaahati hum
 These apologies should be shared with every employee working in TEHELKA
 unhone jis tarah se ek mahila karmchaaree ke saath bartaav kiya, use katai bardaasht nahin kiya ja saktaa
 (this email mentioned the names of several journalists who have not been written under the guidelines to be followed in sexual harassment cases
 )ye rahaa tarun tejpal kaa javabamai dear shomapichley kuch din mere liye bahut imtihaan lene vaale rahe hai or main puri tarah se isaki jimmedaari letaa hum
 This is a slippery lapse in decision making
 halaat ko bahut hi bhadde dhang se galat andaaj main bhampa maine
 This led to this unfortunate incident, which is against all the values in which we believe and for whom we have been fighting
 main pehle hi is maamle se sambhddha patrkaar se bina shart apane bure vyavhaar ke liye maafee maang chukaa hum
 But i think we will have to make more atonement
 tahalaka ko maine apane khun, paseene or aansuon se har din paala posa he, banaaya he
 My close relatives have also done the same hard work in this work
 isane hamaare vakt kii kai mushkil or jaruri ladaaiyaan ladi hai
 Has always stood with the victim, favored us justice
 bure se bure vakt main maine tahalaka or iske patrakaron ko satta pratishthan or duusare corporate dabaavon se mukt rakhaa he or bachaaya bhi he
 i have always believed that the organization named Tehelka and its work is more important than anyone
 or aise main yah behad traasad he ki ek galat faisla lekar maine khud apane oonche mulyon ko thes pahunchaai he
 Since this matter is of Tehelka, i feel that atonement cannot be done by just saying a few words
 mujhe aise kathor dand se guzarana hi hoga, jo meri cheer faad kare
 So i propose that i stay away from the position of Tehelka editor and its office for six months
 shoma tum hameshaa is sanghathan kii pramukh stambh rahi ho
 i apologize to you and all the employees
 main tumhaare kaabil haathon main tahalaka saunp rahaa hum

 yah desh kii suraksha ke liye behatar kadam he
 You do not see benefit from this right now, but will benefit in the long run
 kyonki ghuspaith or anya prakaar ke risk management ke hisaab se ye kaaphi laabhprad hoga

 In this match, Jadeja scored 77 runs while Dhoni scored 50 runs

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni appeared in the semi-final match battling his same old weakness
 dhoni strike ko kam rotate kar rahe the or dot ball adhik khel rahe the
 Due to this weakness of Dhoni, India's innings slows down
 dhoni kii dhimi ballebaaji ke kaaran jadeja par dabaav bad gaya or 48wein over main vah out ho gaye
 Overall, the tournament has not been good for the middle-order batsmen, which has put pressure on themselves
 is match main jab bharat ko apni ran gati badhaane kii darkaar thi, to yah dhoni bebas najar aae
 Dhoni (50) hit 1 fours and a six off 72 balls

 VVS Laxman had said that Dhoni will have to work on this approach

 This creates pressure on the team and the player batting with them

 vanade main filding ke dauraan 30 gaj ke daayre main khilaadiyon kii sankhya ko lekar isisi ke niyam par kai diggajon ne aitaraaz jataana shuru kar diya he
 Former Indian captain Rahul Dravid has asked the ICC to look again at this rule
 12 shatak or 83 ardhshtakon ke sahare vanade main das hazaar se zyaada or test main 36 shatakon ke sahare 13 hazaar se zyaada ran banane vaale rahul dravid khaaskar vanade main ballebaazon ke dabadabe ko lekar kaase fikramand nazar aate hai
 This time during the World Cup's 42 league matches, more than 100 runs were scored 17 times in the last ten overs
 jabaki 2011 main sirf 6 baar aakiri das overon main 100 se zyaada ran bane the
 Not only this, the batsmen have scored 388 sixes in league matches, compared to 258 sixes in the 2011 World Cup
 iespien crickinfo ko die gaye ek intervyuu main dravid kehete hai ki 30 gaj ke ghere ke andar hameshaa paanch fielderon ke niyam ko lekar hi pareshaani he
 i think the ICC will definitely look at it
 wo kehete hai ki isse gendbaazon par dabaav bad rahaa he or timen iskaa faaydaa uthaakar bade score bana rahi hai jo shaayad is khel ke liye acha nahin he
 Dravid says that due to this rule, there are not very close matches in the tournament
 isse khel kaa romaanch ghat jayega
 They also believe that teams are scoring more runs in Australia probably because of the slow pitch
 maujuuda niyamon ke mutabik pehle das overon main sirf do filders 30 gaj ke ghere ke baahar rah sakate hai
 Only three fielders can be left out during the batting powerplay (before 40 overs)
 jabaki baaqi vakt main bhi chaar filder se zyaada 30 gaj ke ghere ke baahar nahin rah sakate
 Like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid also favored the presence of associate members in the World Cup
 dravid kehete hai ki 14 tiimon kaa toornament main hona acchhee baat he
 While Sachin Tendulkar has already favored 25 teams to participate in the World Cup

 After discussing tea, BJP in Delhi will discuss pakoras
 dilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne is baat kaa elaan kiya he
 Manoj Tiwari said that the Congress and other parties are constantly making fun of it by talking about the pakodas, but it is an honor for the small workers and hence BJP will start a discussion campaign on pakodas in Delhi on February 12
 is kaarykram kaa makasad chote kamgaaron ko sammaan pradaan karnaa hoga
 Actually, Narendra Modi's statement on pakoda employment was now proving to be a sore throat for the BJP
 halaat yah he ki vipaksh hi nahin, soshal media par bhi ise lekar khub chutki lee ja rahi he
 Budget 2018-19 was also targeted by the opposition due to pakodanomics and pakoda employment
 ise chote kamgaaron se jodakar bijepi garib tabake tak apni pahunch bananaa chaahati he taaki pakora par ho rahi kirakiri ko garib tabake ke sammaan ke saath joda ja sake
 Delhi BJP will add handloom, chai wala, pakodas to this campaign in Delhi, in which Delhi BJP leaders will discuss tea and pakoras with small workers
 manoj tiwari ke alaava dilli bijepi ke saare netaa 12 farvari ko dilli ke har ilaake main is masale par charchaa karenge
 Let us know that the Aam Aadmi Party, which has been in power in Delhi, has accused the Modi government of not finding a solution to the issue of unemployment and engaging people in Pakoda employment
 aam aadmi party ne to soshal media par is masale par bhaajapa kii khinchaai shuru kar di he
 Manoj Tiwaripkode is also ready to give a couple of hands to the Aam Aadmi Party during the discussion
 darasal, bhaajapa nahin chaahati he ki log vipaksh kii baton main aakar modi sarkaar par apana bharosa naa kho den
 Therefore, this program is considered very important
 puri dilli main bhaajapa pakora par charchaa karegi

 party vid diference kaa naaraa dene vaali bijepi kii kaaryastylee ho yaa phir vyavhaar, ab congress ke dharre par chalati dikh rahi he
 The BJP has always accused Congress leaders of flattering the nehru-gandhi family
 isamen congress ke netaaon ne sahi myne main koi kasar bhi nahin chodi he
 If there is any comment on the Congress President Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi from the opposition, then such leaders of the Congress who are not authorized to talk in the media on behalf of the party, jump into defense
 haal hi main chhattisgarh ke congress adhyaksh or kendriya rajyamantri charandas mahant ne to chapalusee kii had paar karte hue kah diya tha ki agar sonia gandhi unhen congress karyaalay main jhaadu lagane ko kahe to to ve khushi-khushi laga denge
 Some similar statements have been made in the past by Congress leaders even during Indira Gandhi and such leaders have reached the highest post of the country many times
 lekin kya bijepi bhi usee dagar par chal rahi he
 The effect of the workers' craze towards bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi was that the party did not worry about Modi's image and made him its supreme leader
 lekin modi ke prati deewangi ab chapalusee main badalane lagi he
 Modi's rally in Delhi is to be held on September 29, for which preparations are going on vigorously
 bijepi kii dilli ikai ne apane ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa modi ke shankhanaad ke baad hi karne kaa man banaaya he
 But this will probably be the first time in the political history of the BJP when a leader is going to do a ground worship of that place before the rally
 dilli bijepi ne 19 sitambar ko 11 baje rohinee ke japani park main bhoomi pujan kaa kaarykram rakhaa he
 Before Narendra Modi's rally, Bhoomi Poojan will be done at the venue, as if the Lord of the BJP is going to descend on September 29
 modi ke prati bijepi main chapalusee kii parampara gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main unki hetric jeet ke saath hi ho chukaa tha
 The hallmark of which has been reflected in the statements of many leaders
 rashtriya adhyaksh rajnath singh khud apane nai pari ke pehle din se hi modi ko sabase zyada lokapriy netaaon main shumaar karte rahe hai
 However, leaders like Sushma Swaraj have dismissed this statement many times as personal opinion
 lekin bihar main nitish kumaar se gathbandhan khatm hone ke baad bijepi kii rajya kaaryakarini ne to baqayada prastaav paarit kar modi ko pradhanmantri ummidavaar banane kii manshaa jaahir kar di thi

 Her father is a BSF constable
 kendriya vidhyalay sanghathan (kevies) ke adhikari ne kaha, yah ghatana durbhagyapurna he or is maamle main skool prashasan kii koi galati nahin mili he

 After the school holiday on Tuesday, the younger daughter reached home but her elder daughter did not return
 choti beti ne bataaya ki uski bahan skool main hi he, teachers ne parijanon ko skool main bulaayaa he
 When the girl's mother went to school, she could not find her daughter there
 teacher ne jaankaree di ki wo ghar chali gai he
 The mother saw the daughter sitting on the bus stand and crying
 usne bataaya ki ek chaatra kii maa ne uske saath budtamiji kii he, isapar maa ne bacchon kaa jhagada samajhakar gambhirtha se nahin liya or beti ko chup kara diya
 After that she went out of some work

 aalia bhatta kii maa or actress soni razdan ne film sand kii aankh main sahi umr ke actors ko naa lene par niraashaa jataai he
 Before Sony, Neena Gupta also gave her opinion on the casting of actors in the film
 soni ne quint se baat karte hue kaha, 'main un donon actors (taapasi pannu or bhoomi pednekar) se pyaar karti hum, lekin aisa kyon? main samajhati hum ki box offis ke bare main sochna padataa he, lekin phir 60 saal ke insaan kii kahani ko bananaa hi kyon jab aap asli 60 saal ke logon ko usamen le hi naa sako?'asal main film sand kii aankh main taapasi pannu or bhoomi pednekar ko liya gaya he
 Both of these actresses are 30 years and above
 jabaki film main donon 60 saal kii umr kii shooterdaadiyon kii bhoomika nibhaa rahi hai
 Sony further said, 'this thing doesn't make any sense
 mujhe lagata he ki ye pramanikta kii baat he
 If the show was created with The Cumminski Method, the 30-year-old actor, would he have done so much? This is a very stupid thing
 mujhe film kii script ke bare main nahin pataa or mere liye ye maan lenaa mushkil he
 All i am saying is that these things breaking the Bollywood stereotype are nonsense

 bjp's formula failed in maharashtra-haryana, was found in states like Bihar, will be successful in Jharkhand, Delhi, Bihar, the process of forming government in Maharashtra, changing political events every hour has made it clear that bjp's ambitious "exclusion Policy" "has failed
 agar bijepi kii ranneeti par gaur karen to pataa chalata he ki har rajya main ek prabhavi yaa yun kahen dabang jatiyon ko "exclud" kar anya jatiyon ko golband kar vot hasil karne kii tarkeeb ne shuruaati taur par bijepi ko jabardast safalataa dilwaai
 But now such results are not coming, due to which the BJP has reduced from the party that ruled 71% of the country in December 2017 to 40% in just two years i
e
 November 2019
 or is baat kii pushti kam se kam haal main aae haryana or maharashtra ke chunaav parinaam karte hai
 In the last election of Haryana, the BJP targeted strong anti-jat voters and closed the shop of the ever overbearing Jat leaders
 lekin is baar wo nahin ho paaya
 Perhaps Jat voters understood the trick and this time they united Dushyant Chautala and Bhupendra Singh Hooda, forcing the BJP to kneel before the Chautala family
 haryana main kya hua?haryana kii tarah maharashtra main bhi majboot maratha lobby ko kinare kar bijepi ne gaiyr-maratha voters ko target kar 2014 main sarkaar banane main safalataa pai
 But this time in Maharashtra, the same thing happened in Haryana
 sabase badi party hone or sabase puraane saathi hone ke baavjood devendra fadanvis siem nahin ban sake or bijepi maratha pride ke saamne ensipi-congress ke haathon maat kha gai
 The test of this policy of bjp's exclusion is yet to be seen in Jharkhand, Bihar and UP
 jharkhand main gaiyr-adivasee, to bihar-upi main bhi bijepi ne isi tarah yadavon ko said karke gaiyr-yadav voters ko target kar sarkaar banane main safalataa hasil kii
 The same formula adopted in Jharkhand! If we look at Jharkhand, the issue of litching was raised in Godda to counter the 25% tribal and 7% Muslim population, so that the polarization of votes can be done on hindu-muslim basis
 adivasee or muslim ke 32% vot ke mukaable bijepi ne 5% agadi jatiyon, 11% dalit or 50% se bhi zyada OBC voters par focus kiya
 Even if Yadav and others were reduced to more than 50% of the OBC voters, the BJP has managed to get a large population from this section to vote in its favor on the basis of hindu-muslim
 uttar pradesh main fail hua SP-BSP gathbandhanvahin uttar pradesh main akhilesh or mayawati ke gathbandhan ke baavjood bhi agar bijepi jeet gai or ye donon buree tarah se haare, to yahaan bhi bijepi kii exklujan policy hi kaam ai
 The BJP also managed to win over non-yadavs and non-jatavs in its favor except Akhilesh's core Yadav and Mayawati's Jatav voters
 jiske kaaran bijepi ko vidhansabha or loksabhaa donon main landslide victory mili or akhilesh kaam karne vaale siem ke rup main pahchaan banane ke baavjood bhi buree tarah se haar gaye
 Even the magic of MY did not work in Bihar
 Similarly, in Bihar 34% "MY", it was not difficult to shake Laluraj on the basis of backward and backward, because 34% together Yadav, 14% and Muslim 20% together 34
 % To form a strong 'MY' equation
 lekin usee exklujan policy ke tahat bijepi yahaan bhi apni safalataa darj karwaane main safal rahi
 In Bihar, the BJP tried to sway the other obcs, leaving Yadav alone
 gaiyr yadav, obisi main nitish or ramvilas paswan ko apni ore kargaiyr-yadav, obisi or dalit votonmen sendhamari kar bijepi ne apana rasta banaaya
 Now it remains to be seen whether this will be the condition of the bjp's exclusion policy in the future, which happened in Haryana and Maharashtra? Elections are going on in Jharkhand, while next year in Bihar, assembly elections are to be held in 2022 in UP

 in par charchaa ke liye notice bhi die gayi hai
 The Leader of the Opposition had said that apart from this, new issues imposed in the context of the nuclear deal with the US and international issues such as the increasing attack on Indian fishermen by Sri Lanka have also been given notice of discussion

 On the other hand, the Leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj had challenged that with the arrows in the Prime Minister's quiver, try and see who will attack who tomorrow

 ' rajdhani dilli se kareeb 200 kilometre dur, pashchimi uttar pradesh ke chote se shahar saharanpur kii sankari galiyon main mohammad mazhar kadhaiwalon ke paaramparik kashide ke kaam main apane agle collection ke liye nai prerana khoj rahe hai
 The 29-year-old has showcased her work twice at Lakme Fashion Week and was considered one of the most prolific gennext fashion designers
 lekin ve saharanpur se hi kaam karke santusht hai or kisi bade shahar main jaakar basane kaa unka koi iraadaa nahin he
 He justifies his intention, saying that he finds aphasines and references to his designs here
 ve kisi haai-profile kariyar kii sthapit dharanaon kaa pratirodh karte hai or sabase badi baat to yah he ki ve is chote-se shahar ko desh ke fishan nakshe par taankne kaa madda rakhte hai
 It all started when Mazhar, studying in the ninth grade, set up a boutique in school with one of his seniors
 us senior ke pita kaa bhi ek boutique tha
 Mazhar's first collection was Dhobighat in 2017
 usamen unke shahar se judi yaadon ko ukera gaya tha
 Sakina Begum, a woman who used to do laundry, used to visit him constantly and made small marks on clothes
 lihaaja mazhar ke collection ke safed kapadon par ve nishaan the jinhe sakina or 30 anya mahilaon ne ek dizin sareekha banane ke liye kapadon par ankit kiya tha
 His next collection used the art of Rafugar, ie the mark of Rafu
 ve kehete hai, "meri prerana bhartiya karigar hai, khaskar ve jo paroksh rup se fishan udyog ko apana yogadan dete hai, jaise dhobi or rafugar
 Saharanpur is known for wooden handicrafts and Mazhar's family is also engaged in the same work
 ve kehete hai, "ek paaramparik musalmaan parivaar se hone kii vajah se mere liye yah kahana aasaan nahin tha ki main diziner bananaa chahta hum
 "they are running their labels under the National Employment Program and around 70 people are working for them
" unki dizin main chote shahar ke jivan or vahaan ke kaarigaron ke taur-tareekon kii jhalak milti he
 Rahul Mishra also remembers his village Malhausi in his collection displayed at Paris Fashion Week
 unki diginon main bhi puraani yaaden ahm takat ke rup main ubhartee hai
 He had a very close relationship with many things in his childhood — pillows, curtains, tablecloths, grandmother's whitewash, small ponds, dew drops and the white weavers and weavers of his small village in Uttar Pradesh and Neele Chaukhana — now they are all part of her stories as a designer
 bhartiya fishan ko chote shaharon se aane vaale diziner aakaar dete rahe hai, par unhone dilli-mumbai ko apana baseraa bana liya he
 For example, Samant Chauhan coming from a small place near Jamalpur in Bihar or Sanjay Garg of Raw Mango
 par dizinron kii ek jamaat aisi bhi he jo chote shaharon main rahakar kaam kar rahi he or soshal media tathaa i-commers ke jariye apane hunar ko duniyabar main pahunchaa rahi he
 For example, 32-year-old Sreejit Jeevan from Kochi, Kerala, says he is moving towards "unfashioning" and that the joy of a slow-moving life inspires his design
 ve kehete hai, "ham itani teji se bhaag rahe hai ki kabhi-kabhi to hamaare paas barish kii buundon or chidipoon kii chahachahahat jaisi choti-choti chizon ke liye bhi vakt nahin hota
 "staying away from the fashion capital of the country may have some disadvantage, but the feeling of home is something else, working in a place that you know and understand
" neshnal institute of dizin (anidi) ahmedabad or ienesaidi paris se pard chuke jivan kehete hai, "aaj fishan har jagah he
 It is not just limited to metro cities
 meri kahaniyon main vaishvik graahakon ke liye sthaneey khushboo he
 He started his label Rauka in 2013
 kuch anya dizinron ke saath origins kii shuruyaat kar unhone kerala main baadh prabhavit bunakaron ko apane paanvon par khadaa hone main madad kii he
 Sustainable fashion and crafts are now becoming new sources of this industry
 aise main koi hairaani nahin ki diziner apane ateet ke anubhavon ko tatol rahe hai or dizin kii nai shabdaawalee tay kar rahe hai
 In this they are not only incorporating their social consciousness but also feel the need to be innovative with local workmanship and references
 masalan, bihar ke saamaajik udhyami or diziner praveen chouhan ne apane mul sthaan ke paas bodhgaya main ek saamaajik upkram shuru kiya he matra—madarli-lagjri-artistry
 Praveen, who has studied at the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), collects flower waste from the Mahabodhi Temple and converts it into a natural dye with Kathy Williams
 kathi australian hai or ek sasteneble label "bikoj of nechar'' kii sansthaapak hai
 Together, they have set up the Happy Hands project
 praveen kehete hai, "kaarigaron ne hi hamaari kala or samskruti ko jinda rakhaa he
 These artisans have taken me to a different level of creativity
 ab duusare deshon ke kai log paaramparik bhartiya vastra or hastshilp kaa adhyayan karne ke liye mujhase sampark karte hai
 The Happy Hands project is a joint initiative of the Bodh Gaya Temple Management Committee, Matru and the Bikos of Nature
 iskaa makasad khaadi par prakritik daai ke istemaal ke jariye logon ko tikaoo rojgaar uplabdh karana or kaarigaron ke kaushal ko badhaava dena he
 When Praveen enrolled Nikrat Maung, people had made fun of him that he was learning tailor work by spending so much money
 lekin unke contractor pita ne har sthiti main unka saath diya
 Today, Praveen is credited with popularizing Khadi again

 Her husband started ecological cotton farming in 2005 through contract farming
 saal 2008 main nachiar ne ek handloom studio sthapit kiya or 2009 main ithicus kii sah-sansthaapak ban gayi
 She explains, "everything i have been able to do in Ithicus is because i am from a small town

 i have my own production facility here and local artisans are also working
 ''jab unhone ithicus kii shuruyaat kii thi to handloom brand bahut kam the or chunautiyaan bahut zyada

 naushaad ali kii kahani bhi aisi hi he
 Ali, 33, says, "my father was a cloth merchant
 desh ke kone-kone se aae kapadon ke bandal hamaare ghar main bhare rahete the or main unki tanging karne main apane pita kii madad karata tha
 i got identified with clothing and fashion
 '' unhen is baat kaa bharosa nahin tha ki unhen diziner ke taur sweekaar kar liya jayega, isliye jab unhone puduccheri main apane label kii shuruyaat kii to khud ko paanch saal kaa vakt diya
 Says Ali, “we are committed to creating a sustainable label differently

 i believe in slow fashion, in making things that last for a long time and be meaningful
 '' ali vellore main paidaa hue the or mata-pita ke puduccheri main jaakar basane se pehle ve chennai or bangaluru main bhi rahe
 Ali set up Studio Liam in Auroville in 2014 to understand the mastery of Indian artisans and mold them into contemporary fashion
 fishan kii unki paribhaasha he—koi jaldbaaji nahin, koi sijan nahin, kuch he to sirf samay or patibaddhta
 In 2017, three years after starting his label, he received the prestigious Grazia Young Sustainable Designer Award

 At the same time, most did not want to work on contemporary assumptions because they feared that they would not go on much

 aaj puraa desh 72 waan swatantraaa diwas manaa rahaa he
 Independence is ringing in every corner of India

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has also reached Red Fort to celebrate Independence Day
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi tamaam vieepi ke bich agali pankti main baithe najar aae
 The interesting thing is that Rahul Gandhi did not get a place in the front row at Rajpath in the last Republic Day (january 26, 2017) celebrations
 jo charchaa kaa vishay bana tha
 Congress had made the issue of Rahul Gandhi getting a place in the first line of special guests
 party ne ise paramparaon ko darkinar kar pehle chauthi or phir chhathi pankti main rahul gandhi ko jagah dene par aitraaj jataayaa tha
 However, security was cited later on his seating arrangement
 rahul gandhi ke saath ganatantr diwas parade ke dauraan rajyasabha main netaa vipaksh gulam nabi aaazaad bhi najar the
 Although, on the occasion of Independence Day, Rahul Gandhi appeared in the first line, but Gulam Nabi Azad today also appeared behind
 swatantraaa diwas samaaroh main shirkat karne ke liye purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh, grahamantri rajnath singh, purv pradhanmantri echdi devegoda samet tamaam netaa pahunche
 Rahul Gandhi was seen sitting near Union Minister Nitin Gadkari

 He is believed to have postponed his trip to Dubai and a networking event with Indian businessmen in Bahrain on 26 December
 vajah? sansad kaa satr chal rahaa he or 5 janvari tak chalegaa
 So what to say, late arrival
 
 
 ? Did Rahul Gandhi target PM Modi for surgical strike, the entire BJP went against Rahul Gandhi and Congress
 bijepi ke saansad manoj tiwari ne kaha ki congress raaj main desh rasaatal main chalaa gaya tha
 Manoj Tiwari said that Rahul Gandhi should apologize for his statement regarding the brokerage of the soldiers
 sawaal- rahul gandhi ne kaha he ki modi ne javaanon ke khun kii dallali kii he kis dhang se dekhte hai is bayaan ko?manoj tiwari- aaj rahul gandhi kii maansikta or sochate bahut taras aata he pehle se bhi ab jin shabdon kaa prayog kiya he usase bhi puraa vishwaas ho gaya he ki inaki maansikta or soch aisi he jisko aalochana karne ke liye mere paas shabdon kii kami pad jaati he
 He has had 10 years, has taken the country to the abyss
 ab jab desh khadaa ho rahaa he sammaan ke saath uth rahaa he aatankiyon kaa munhtod jawaab diya ja rahaa he tab inako dard ho rahaa he
 Question- Manoj ji Digvijay Singh has also said that the rest of the people are raising the question that instead of saluting the army, instead of giving credit to them, BJP is taking credit of this matter Amit Shah is taking credit
 manohar parrikar credit le rahe hai
 Giving credit to Modi, the issue is being politicized? Manoj Tiwari - Not so
 credit sena ko he har koi indian army ko sailyut kar rahaa he or har aadmi surakshabalon ko sailyut kar rahaa he
 They do not know what is hurting them
 ye bhi hamaari bhartiya sena kaa manobal kabhi badha sakate the inke dard kaa kya kaaran hamako pataa nahin lekin jin shabdon kaa prayog rahul gandhi ne kiya he uski to jitani bhi ninda kii jaae bahut kam he or is par rahul gandhi ko maafee maangi maangi chahie
 Many people will be surprised to know that 'hindu Rashtra' is invoked only once in the prayer of RSS (rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh)
 prarthana kahati he, ''vayam hindu rashtrang bhuta: (ham sabhi 'hindu raashtra' kaa hissaa hai)
 "the RSS does not say that we will create a new Hindu nation, nor does it say that we will amend the Constitution of India and declare this country a Hindu nation
" phir bhi hindu raashtra ke liye sangh kii patibaddhta se bhay se lekar naaraazgi or hairaani tak paidaa ho jaati he
 The RSS is condemned while the majority of people welcome the 'creation' of the Hindu nation
 donon taraf agyanta yaa spashtataa kii kami he
 The apprehension or uneasiness about the Hindu nation stems from an unknown fear
 yahi agyaat dar logon ko ekajute karata he or unhen garv or suraksha kii juthi bhaavana se bhar detaa he
 In fact, the Sangh believes that there is no need to make India a Hindu nation because it is already a Hindu nation
 yah mahatvapurn he ki 'hindu vichaar' ko 'raashtra vichaar' ke rup main dekha jaae, jaisaa 'bharat vichaar' ke bare main kaha jaataa he
 It is as wrong to ridicule and dismiss the idea of hindu Rashtra as communal, divisive and unconstitutional, as dismissing the idea of 'bharat' as a confusing knowledge
 vastav main, kareebi vishleshan karne par yah spasht ho jaataa he ki inke bich koi bhed he hi nahin
 The RSS has repeatedly reiterated its allegiance and resolve to the Indian Constitution, which, incidentally, has not been a stereotype; Rather, modifications have been made from time to time
 isliye, aresas ko samvidhan virdohi ke rup main chitrit karnaa bauddhik rup se beyimaani he
 However, the RSS will welcome a socio-political system that more accurately reflects Indian ethos or 'indianness' than the current institutional structure
 isliye, aresas ke liye sabhi ke man main baithe us andeh ko dur karke yah spasht karnaa aavashyak he ki 'hindu raashtra' kaa vichaar, aaj ke bharat ke vichaar kaa koi pratwaad nahin he
 The idea of india is inclusive, so is the idea of hindu nation; It combines all the ideas, identities and ideas which are collectively called Hindus
 jati, varg or bhashaayi vibhaajan to hai, lekin ve upree hai
 In the original Hindu way, the phrase 'unity in diversity' fits very well with life
 sadiyon tak bahari luteron ke hamalon, aupniveshik antarasambandh or hindu samaaj ke aatm-pratibandhak, swaabhaavik or astitv se judi anaichhik pratikriyaaon ne hindu samaaj ke kuch mul siddhanton ke abhyaas ko buree tarah prabhavit kiya jisase isamen kai kureetiyaan ain
 However, diverse identities have been a part of the original Hindu belief and 'lifestyle'
 ve upar se bhinn dikhaai de sakate hai, jisase unhen 'hindutv' par bhi shankaa hoti he or use khatre ke rup main dekhte hai
 Supporters of Hindu Rashtra need to work on this aspect and instead of formulating 'our-versus-their' narrative, they should pursue their vision through an inclusive and positive program
 hindu, hindutv or hindu dharm ko lambey samay se galat tareeke se paribhaashit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The word religion, as also associated with 'hinduism', cannot be associated with the Western concept of religion
 vastav main, 'hindu dharm' shabd hi apane aap main anuchit he
 In fact, 'hindu' refers to a society, a group of people with distinct cultural and civilizational character, who have certain beliefs, traditions, practices and yes, prejudices too
 bhartiya sandarbh main, dharm samaaj ke dainik jivan kaa aadhaar he
 This implies more than morality, values and social practices, not religion
 aazaadee ke baad se dharm, aasthaa, dharmanirpekshata, raashtra, rajya vagairah ke bare main jo bhi vimarsh hue, vastav main ve bhartiya sandarbh main samajhane kii koshishon ke bina hue
 The fact must be accepted that religion does not mean religion and there is no justification for secularism in the Indian context
 hindu or raashtra shabd bahuaiami hai or inamen aitihaasik pracheentaayen hai
 The idea of nationalism and its features should be explained in the context of the freedom struggle, its various anecdotes and its culmination in freedom and division
 'hindu rashtrawaad' ek khaas saamaajik-rajnatik vichaar kii abhivyakti he, jo swadeshi saanskrithik paramparaon or purab ke vyapak aadhyatmik anubhavon par aadhaarit he
 Some scholars have argued that the use of the term 'hindu nationalism' for 'hindu indoctrination' is unilateral and misleading
 unke vichaar se, 'hindu rajya' ek behatar shabd hoga
 This understanding developed into a colonial influence that broke this cultural continuity, neutralizing the civilizational gains and creating ignorance and misunderstanding about Hinduism and its impact on nationalism
 ek samaaj or raashtra ke rup main bharat kaa vichaar kabhi bhi dharm aadhaarit nahin tha; yah ek adwitiya 'dharmanirpekshata' kaa vichaar tha
 Complex forms of overlapping, coexisting beliefs are found in diverse forms of worship
 pashchimi or semetic dharmik paramparaon ke vipareet, kisi ek sanstha dwaara kisi ek mat ko puri tarah cmand kiya janaa yaa phir ek pavitra pustak dwaara kisi mat kii sabhi manyataon kaa purna nirdhaaran, mul hindu avadharana ke viruddh he
 Therefore, India does not need a constitution to learn the virtues of secularism or coexistence, or to formulate and enforce separate rules for citizens and non-citizens
 vishwa ke prati hamaara drushtikon vasudaiv kutunbakam ke moolmantra se nirdeshit hota he
 Keeping this tradition in mind, it was not considered necessary to use the word 'secularism' in the original Constitution of India of 1950
 immergency ke dauraan 1976 main, indira gandhi kii sarkaar ne 42waan sanshodhan kiya
 Through this, along with other far-reaching changes, in the Preamble to the Constitution, the word 'secular' was added — India is no longer just a 'sovereign, democratic republic'; It was now a 'sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic'! But was India any less secular between 1947 and 1976, or are we now more secular as the Constitution now says? However, the constitutional guarantee given to religious minorities became a toy in the hands of political parties to polarize votes
 garibi, berogari, avasaron or aadhunik shiksha ke abhaav or nirvaachit sarkaron kaa pakshpaati ravaiya, bahusnkhyakon ko lekar alpsankhyakon ke man main ashanka or dar ko gaharaa karata he
 Serious efforts should be made to bridge the gap between mutual faiths among people of different religious beliefs
 akele sangh us sethu kaa nirmaan nahin kar saktaa; isaki jimmedaari sabaki he
 Violence, seditiousness and hateful conduct by extreme vigilance and mob are reflections and should not be associated with Hindutva for some inherent pseudo-benefits
 nihsandeh, aaj hinduon ke bich ek nishchit rajnatik jagriti ai he
 Particularly weak Dalits and large sections of OBC stand behind the ruling party in the hope of their rights and socio-economic progress
 jis tarah kabhi musalmaan congress ke liye vot bank ban gaye the, usee tarah hinduon ke kai pichde virgon ko aaj apni kismat chamakane kii sambhaavna bhaajapa main hi dikhti he
 But any such empowerment or political expansion will be in vain if it is confined only to the exchange of victims
 nishchit rup se samtawadi samaaj hi ek adarsh vyavastha ho saktaa he
 The Sangh's 'creation' of a Hindu nation is merely an anticipated dawn of ideas whose embrace does not pose any crisis for diversity
 sheshadri chaari angreji saptahik orgeniser ke purv sampadak or suraksha tathaa ranneetik maamalon ke tippaneekar hai*** There is no answer to the beauty of the Taj Mahal of Agra, which is famous as a symbol of love worldwide
 tajmahal sirf pyaar kii nishaani hi nahin he, balki iskaa naam duniya ke saat ajoobon main bhi shumaar kiya jaataa he
 Everyone is obsessed with this beautiful and loving building
 yahi vajah he ki isaki khubsuurati logon ke dilon par chai he

 The Taj Mahal was embroidered on Kajol's simple black blouse

 By the way, seeing this embroidery of Kajol's blouse once again you will surely say, wow Taj! yun to tajmahal par bahut-se gane or gaanon main tajmahal kaa seen to aapane bahut dekha hoga lekin is tarah se tajmahal kii blouse par kalakaari vaaki hat kar or kaabiletarif he

 He was brutally beaten
 unhone kaha ki vah apane bete ko do alag-alag aspataalon main le gaye, lekin use bachaa nahin paae

 If the question of employment finds a metaphor for frying the pakora, and understanding the formula of the Archmidis who have created the metaphor, then the challenges of the youth who are killed by employment are increased
 wo apane rojgaar or use dene kii sarkari vyavastha ko lekar sawaal puch rahe hai magar poochne se pehle unhen pakora kaa formula thama diya ja rahaa he
 The tough question of pakoda employment has got everyone's hands as an easy and cruel joke
 soshal media main sab pakora tal rahe hai
 Those who are asking the selection commissions for jobs, they are sitting on a dharna by putting tarpaulins in some corner or opposing the joke happening with the number of hundred and fifty

 Why not a single exam is done properly
 kyon baar-baar chori hoti he, kuch aisa hota he ki pariksha radd ho jaati he
 Can we not demand an honest examination system in 21st century India? isamen bhi bheetar bheetar ek dhandha punap rahaa he
 The institution conducting the examination is government, but a contract is given to a private company to conduct the examination

 This march is on 5th February, a march was taken out from Gardnibagh in Patna, between Ashiana Fold, which is named Aakrosh March

 Neither the city nor the government was affected by their march
 awaz uthaane kaa farz kintu rasm adaayagi se loktantr bhi gauravanvit nahin hua hoga
 The miscreants have a separate country of their own, this country has been removed from every state and put in a corner as if people used to gather at Delhi's Jantar Mantar

 The picture of the demonstration was shown so that you do not say that these people do not raise their voice

 The youth told that on February 6, 2018, they laid siege to the house of Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi
 path nirmaan vibhaag mantri nand kishor yadav kaa putala dahan kiya

 These youngsters also showed us a list of their demonstrations which include Angry march, effigy burning, fast unto death, general assembly, college lockout, torch march, assembly siege
 aatmadah bhi he, jo nahin hona chahie
 No one came to talk to him in 65 days
 ab aap zaraa dhyaan se is timeline ko padhie
 An examination has gone missing in India
 pariksha dene vaale chaatr dharne par hai magar pariksha kaa kahin ata pataa nahin he
 There is a Bermuda triangle of ruining the youth, in which no matter how many soldiers have disappeared forever
 7 janvari 2010 ko bihar sarkaar ne bihar karmchaaree chayan ayog kaha ki 2030 junior ejeeniyar kii bhartee kii prakriya aarambh kii jaae
 a year and a half later, on 8 June 2011, the advertisement of recruitment shows that the marks of the written examination will be reinstated from the merit list
 iske 15 maheene baad 30 sitambar 2012 ko patna shahar ke vibhinn kendron par pariksha lee jaati he
 Think that in January 2010, the state of Bihar feels the need for 2030 Junior Engineers, till 30 September 2012 only the examination takes place
 deree se hui bhartee par rajya kii pragati par kya asar padaa, naujavaanon kii barbaadi kaise hui, iskaa koi soshal audit hamaare paas nahin he
 Two and a half years after the advertisement is released, the written examination gets mired in controversies
 840 ummidavaaron ko chori se uttar pustika bharwate hue pakadaa jaataa he
 The matter reaches the court and comes the order of the High Court that the case will go on, first draw the Bihar Staff Selection Commission Result
 7 may 2014 ko jab rigelt nikalataa he to un 840 ummidavaaron kaa bhi naam merit list main aata he jo chori karte pakade gaye the or jinke khilaaf police ne cese darj kiya tha
 The case then reaches Hoi Court
 ab yahaan se main apni kahani thodi choti karata hum
 a project is being run to cheat our own citizens and make India a world guru, which is a megaproject in its own right
 cese chalata he, jaanch hoti he or june 2016 main hoicourt puraa riselt hi radd kar detaa he
 2010 to 2016 arrived
 2030 junior ejeeniyar chune jane kii aas main naujavaanon kii zindagi ke chah saal khatm ho jate hai
 Then the date of this examination comes out
 tay hota he ki 7 agast 2016 ko bhojpur ke anek kendron par pariksha hogi
 Notice comes on 4 August 2016 that there will be no examination on 7 August
 ab nai taarikh yah nikalati he ki pariksha 18 sitambar 2016 ko hogi

 On February 2, 2017, the order of Patna High Court comes that there will be a fresh examination
 janvari 2010 se ham kahaan aa gaye, 2 farvari 2017
 Till now an examination of 2030 Junior Engineers has not been conducted
 31 janvari 2018 tak is pariksha kaa kuch ata pataa nahin chalata he
 Now a new order has come that the next examination will be held in the first week of February 2018 or March
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki hamen in muddon par charchaa kerani chahie
 Without all these questions, how incomplete and hollow our understanding of any system is
 13 series main maine kuch anubhav praapt kiya he
 Can't say with the claim but i am seeing a similar pattern in every state
 pariksha chayan ayog yani sarkaar ke system ke kaaran asafal hoti he, barbaad noujvaan hote hai
 Such news is usually printed in newspapers in some corner
 in naujavaanon kii raajnneetik samaj par tippanee nahin kar saktaa kyonki main jaanata nahin
 But i can guess that somewhere they too would be divided into Hindu or Muslim grooves
 varna jis rajya ke ejineering kalejo main paryaapt shikshak na hon, bina padhe ladke paas hote hon, har saal 10,000 junior ejeeniyar kii degree lekar paas hote hon, uske naujavaanon kii polytical quality bahut karaab he
 If it were not bad then it would not have been easy for anyone to ignore these issues
 bihar ke polytechnic kalege shikshak viheen hai
 There are no teachers
 phir ye kalege chalate kyon hai
 What does it mean to have a polytechnic after three years? iske liye pravesh pariksha kyon lee jaati he
 Two and a half million students fill the form and there are close to 9000 seats
 bihar ke log apane hi naujavaanon ke prati eemaandaar nahin hai, na noujvaan apane prati eemaandaar hai
 What to say, it is the same thing that the political quality of the youth is worse than their degree
 ye baat likhakar naujavaanon ko apane kamare main taang dena chahie ki maine kaha he
 Delhi University Teachers Association Duta organized a big march on 6 February
 badi sankhya main pahunche ye shikshak edaha or temporary padhaa rahe shikshakon ko regular karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 Also that there should be transparency in appointments which is not happening
 ye shikshak faikalti of lau or department of ajukeshan main hui niyuktiyon ko lekar sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 They say that everything has been left to the will of the selection committee except the formula made by the UGC for appointment
 inkaa kahana he ki faikalti of lau main july agast 2017 main 126 padon ke liye intervyuu hua
 The result is yet to come, but even before the envelope opens, the list of lecturer professors selected from the university started circulating from 27 January
 is suchi main pehle se padhaa rahe 84 edaha shikshakon main se aadhe se adhik baahar kar die gaye the
 Against this, Duta took a big front that all those who have been teaching Adhak for 5 years and maximum for 15 years should be hired on permanent jobs
 badi sankhya main permanent shikshakon ne edaha shikshakon kaa saath diya he
 Everyone's life is at stake
 hamane uniwarsity siries kii, kisi ko koi fark nahin padaa
 Everyone has become so confident in Hindu Muslims that there is no longer any status of a citizen
 yah kahani dardanaak he
 Thousands of Adhak teachers have been teaching Adhak at Delhi University for many years
 faikalti of laa main aath saal se edaha padhaa rahi ek lekturer ne bataaya ki aath saal main unhone 15 baar intervyuu diya
 15 times he was hired by the Faculty of LA to teach but was turned out when it came to Permanente
 shikshakon kii bahaali kii paardarshee prakriya na pehle thi na ab he
 Never will, i can give it in writing also
 raajnneetik siforeeshon ke hisaab se bahaaliyaan ho rahi hai
 You cannot change it, yes you can lecture on talent and transparency
 sochie 84 edaha padhaa rahe the unamem se 44 baahar kar die gaye
 What a shock the students must have felt when they saw their good teacher going out like this
 dilli vishvavidhyalay sirf june or july main chamakta lagata he jab akhabaaron ke zarie middle class ko dhokhaa diya jaataa he ki 95 fisadi se adhik laane vaale bacchon ke liye bharat kaa yah shreshth vishvavidhyalay yaheen hai
 The story of Adhak teachers is telling how we all are slaving the system in an independent country
 main ab yah samajhane laga hum ki kyon tivi par yaa media main aise mudde har rose aate hai jo mudde hi nahin hote hai
 i do not see the solution to the injustice that is happening with these teachers
 uniwarsity barbaad hai
 There is no place for qualified teachers anywhere
 aap sochie, aap jin bacchon ke liye achche skool ke naam par lakhon kii fees dete hai, kya-kya nahin sehate hai, jab ve skool se baahar niklenge to unke liye kaisaa college intazaar kar rahaa he
 Never argue over this, the society has discussed a film for three months, you do not know what injustice has been done to the future of your children

 Dinesh spoke to State Finance Excise Minister Prakash Pant

 You go to the house of the youngsters preparing for the railway examination, just reducing the maximum age from 30 to 28 is sadness on the face of so many youth
 unki taiyaari ke teen chaar saal hawa main ud gaye hai
 You meet those UP personnel who were waiting for a job in the police service for clerical, computer service, but the Police Recruitment and Promotion Board canceled the examination

 taaki aap yah na kahen ki inhone loktantric tareekon kaa istemaal nahin kiya
 The youth told that on February 6, 2018, they laid siege to the house of Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi
 path nirmaan vibhaag mantri nand kishor yadav kaa putala dahan kiya
 Look at this slogan
 aisa naaraa aapane che guara kii kranti main bhi nahin suna hoga
 'do not impose the canal dam breaking, restrain the junior engineer, and the written test
 ' modi modi ke naare main ham bhul gaye ki bharat main naaron kii rachanaatmakataa abhi bhi bachi hui he
 These youngsters also showed us a list of their demonstrations which include Angry march, effigy burning, fast unto death, general assembly, college lockout, torch march, assembly siege
 aatmadah bhi he, jo nahin hona chahie
 No one came to talk to him in 65 days
 ab aap zaraa dhyaan se is timeline ko padhie
 An examination has gone missing in India
 pariksha dene vaale chaatr dharne par hai magar pariksha kaa kahin ata pataa nahin he
 There is a Bermuda triangle of ruining the youth, in which no matter how many soldiers have disappeared forever
 7 janvari 2010 ko bihar sarkaar ne bihar karmchaaree chayan ayog kaha ki 2030 junior ejeeniyar kii bhartee kii prakriya aarambh kii jaae
 a year and a half later, on 8 June 2011, the advertisement of recruitment shows that the marks of the written examination will be reinstated from the merit list
 iske 15 maheene baad 30 sitambar 2012 ko patna shahar ke vibhinn kendron par pariksha lee jaati he
 Think that in January 2010, the state of Bihar feels the need for 2030 Junior Engineers, till 30 September 2012 only the examination takes place
 deree se hui bhartee par rajya kii pragati par kya asar padaa, naujavaanon kii barbaadi kaise hui, iskaa koi soshal audit hamaare paas nahin he
 Two and a half years after the advertisement is released, the written examination gets mired in controversies
 840 ummidavaaron ko chori se uttar pustika bharwate hue pakadaa jaataa he
 The matter reaches the court and comes the order of the High Court that the case will go on, first draw the Bihar Staff Selection Commission Result
 7 may 2014 ko jab rigelt nikalataa he to un 840 ummidavaaron kaa bhi naam merit list main aata he jo chori karte pakade gaye the or jinke khilaaf police ne cese darj kiya tha
 The case then reaches Hoi Court
 ab yahaan se main apni kahani thodi choti karata hum
 a project is being run to cheat our own citizens and make India a world guru, which is a megaproject in its own right
 cese chalata he, jaanch hoti he or june 2016 main hoicourt puraa riselt hi radd kar detaa he
 2010 to 2016 arrived
 2030 junior ejeeniyar chune jane kii aas main naujavaanon kii zindagi ke chah saal khatm ho jate hai
 Then the date of this examination comes out
 tay hota he ki 7 agast 2016 ko bhojpur ke anek kendron par pariksha hogi
 Notice comes on 4 August 2016 that there will be no examination on 7 August
 ab nai taarikh yah nikalati he ki pariksha 18 sitambar 2016 ko hogi
 Question papers of second shift and first shift are distributed in the first shift
 saare sawaal ulat pulat ho gaye to hangaamaa hua, maamla pahunchaa phir hai court main
 On February 2, 2017, the order of Patna High Court comes that there will be a fresh examination
 janvari 2010 se ham kahaan aa gaye, 2 farvari 2017
 Till now an examination of 2030 Junior Engineers has not been conducted
 31 janvari 2018 tak is pariksha kaa kuch ata pataa nahin chalata he
 Now a new order has come that the next examination will be held in the first week of February 2018 or March
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki hamen in muddon par charchaa kerani chahie
 Without all these questions, how incomplete and hollow our understanding of any system is
 13 series main maine kuch anubhav praapt kiya he
 Can't say with the claim but i am seeing a similar pattern in every state
 pariksha chayan ayog yani sarkaar ke system ke kaaran asafal hoti he, barbaad noujvaan hote hai
 Such news is usually printed in newspapers in some corner
 in naujavaanon kii raajnneetik samaj par tippanee nahin kar saktaa kyonki main jaanata nahin
 But i can guess that somewhere they too would be divided into Hindu or Muslim grooves
 varna jis rajya ke ejineering kalejo main paryaapt shikshak na hon, bina padhe ladke paas hote hon, har saal 10,000 junior ejeeniyar kii degree lekar paas hote hon, uske naujavaanon kii polytical quality bahut karaab he
 If it were not bad then it would not have been easy for anyone to ignore these issues
 bihar ke polytechnic kalege shikshak viheen hai
 There are no teachers
 phir ye kalege chalate kyon hai
 What does it mean to have a polytechnic after three years? iske liye pravesh pariksha kyon lee jaati he
 Two and a half million students fill the form and there are close to 9000 seats
 bihar ke log apane hi naujavaanon ke prati eemaandaar nahin hai, na noujvaan apane prati eemaandaar hai
 What to say, it is the same thing that the political quality of the youth is worse than their degree
 ye baat likhakar naujavaanon ko apane kamare main taang dena chahie ki maine kaha he
 Delhi University Teachers Association Duta organized a big march on 6 February
 badi sankhya main pahunche ye shikshak edaha or temporary padhaa rahe shikshakon ko regular karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 Also that there should be transparency in appointments which is not happening
 ye shikshak faikalti of lau or department of ajukeshan main hui niyuktiyon ko lekar sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 They say that everything has been left to the will of the selection committee except the formula made by the UGC for appointment
 inkaa kahana he ki faikalti of lau main july agast 2017 main 126 padon ke liye intervyuu hua
 The result is yet to come, but even before the envelope opens, the list of lecturer professors selected from the university started circulating from 27 January
 is suchi main pehle se padhaa rahe 84 edaha shikshakon main se aadhe se adhik baahar kar die gaye the
 Against this, Duta took a big front that all those who have been teaching Adhak for 5 years and maximum for 15 years should be hired on permanent jobs
 badi sankhya main permanent shikshakon ne edaha shikshakon kaa saath diya he
 Everyone's life is at stake
 hamane uniwarsity siries kii, kisi ko koi fark nahin padaa
 Everyone has become so confident in Hindu Muslims that there is no longer any status of a citizen
 yah kahani dardanaak he
 Thousands of Adhak teachers have been teaching Adhak at Delhi University for many years
 faikalti of laa main aath saal se edaha padhaa rahi ek lekturer ne bataaya ki aath saal main unhone 15 baar intervyuu diya
 15 times he was hired by the Faculty of LA to teach but was turned out when it came to Permanente
 shikshakon kii bahaali kii paardarshee prakriya na pehle thi na ab he
 Never will, i can give it in writing also
 raajnneetik siforeeshon ke hisaab se bahaaliyaan ho rahi hai
 You cannot change it, yes you can lecture on talent and transparency
 sochie 84 edaha padhaa rahe the unamem se 44 baahar kar die gaye
 What a shock the students must have felt when they saw their good teacher going out like this
 dilli vishvavidhyalay sirf june or july main chamakta lagata he jab akhabaaron ke zarie middle class ko dhokhaa diya jaataa he ki 95 fisadi se adhik laane vaale bacchon ke liye bharat kaa yah shreshth vishvavidhyalay yaheen hai
 The story of Adhak teachers is telling how we all are slaving the system in an independent country
 main ab yah samajhane laga hum ki kyon tivi par yaa media main aise mudde har rose aate hai jo mudde hi nahin hote hai
 i do not see the solution to the injustice that is happening with these teachers
 uniwarsity barbaad hai
 There is no place for qualified teachers anywhere
 aap sochie, aap jin bacchon ke liye achche skool ke naam par lakhon kii fees dete hai, kya-kya nahin sehate hai, jab ve skool se baahar niklenge to unke liye kaisaa college intazaar kar rahaa he
 Never argue over this, the society has discussed a film for three months, you do not know what injustice has been done to the future of your children
 ab ham baat karenge uttarakhand ke foresti guard ke 1218 padon kii bhartee kii
 Dinesh Mansara has told that on 23 September 2017, more than 25,000 applications are received
 iske liye chaatro se 300 rupee liye jate hai

 Apart from agricultural science, students of Arts Commerce will also be able to sit in this exam

 Straight double
 railway main adhiktam umr 30 saal se ghataakar 28 saal kar di gai he or yahaan 24 saal se badhaakar 42 saal
 This miracle can happen only and only because in this country only the same topic will run and run
 mansera ne bataaya ki isaki koching par chaatr 30-30 hazaar rupye bhi karch kar chuke hai
 Not only this, applications came on 31 December 2016 for 191 posts of Uttarakhand Forest Development Corporation
 500 rupee farm dekar hazaron chaatro ne farm bhare
 Paper leaked yet the paper is not leaked
 2016 se 2018 aa gaya he
 Dinesh Mansera says that the government is strapped with money to pay salaries
 haal hi vetan dene ke liye 500 karod kaa karz liya
 Dinesh spoke to State Finance Excise Minister Prakash Pant
 bengal ke naujavaanon se kaha he ki dhiraj rakhen, unka number aayega
 If you think that just mentioning will do your work, then your understanding is neither of the system nor of democracy nor of your civic duties

 The comments aapkaa dhanyavad West Bengal helpless job seeker hamaari naukari kii series se aap bharat ko dekhie

 aapako pataa chalegaa ki hakeekat kya he or slogan kya he
 You go to the house of the youngsters preparing for the railway examination, just reducing the maximum age from 30 to 28 is sadness on the face of so many youth
 unki taiyaari ke teen chaar saal hawa main ud gaye hai
 You meet those UP personnel who were waiting for a job in the police service for clerical, computer service, but the Police Recruitment and Promotion Board canceled the examination
 ham channelon par chaahe jitani khushhaal tasviren dikhaa len, hakeekat ye he ki noujvaan udhaas hai
 Even though they have no other way but to fry the pakoras
 udhaas haathon se tale gaye pakora kaa swaad feekaa rah jayega
 Sometimes salt will be more, sometimes oil and sometimes pungency
 aapako lag saktaa he ki naukari series mazaaq main kar rahaa hum magar aap saare episod uthaakar ek ek line pard jaaiye aapako system kaa krur cheharaa nazar aayega
 The youth told that on February 6, 2018, they laid siege to the house of Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi
