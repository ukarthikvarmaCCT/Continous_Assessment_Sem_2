 After the terrorist attack on Amarnath pilgrims, the period of protest has started at Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 koi is hamale ko dharm ke naam par kii gai hatya qaraar de rahaa tha to koi ise raajnneeti se jod kar ninda kar rahaa tha
 The biggest question among all of these is whether the people who are performing, even if they are considering themselves above politics, do not become part of the violence in the name of religion by raising a finger on a particular person or caste
 To say that, the protests were carried out against the attack on Amarnath Yatris, but questions were raised on the intentions of the terrorists and the forces hidden behind them

 "not in my name campaign with some similar alphabets Not in my name campaign reached jantar-mantar through social media
 iskaa makasad naam ke aadhaar par hoti hatyaon kaa virodh karnaa or mob linching ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaanaa tha
 Keeping himself away from politics, questions were raised on the Modi government sitting at the center and a message of brotherhood was given, targeting Hindu organizations
 inkaa bhi maananaa he ki ab desh kaa yuva or bardaasht nahin karegaa or ab vakt aa gaya he ki aisi takaton ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai jaae
 In the midst of the Rimjhim rains, the method of demonstrations after the one at jantar-mantar may have been different, but the motive was shown
 dharm or jati ke naam parahone vaali hinsa ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaate hue ye khud us raajnneeti kaa hissaa ban gaye hai jiske virodh main ye sadak par utre the

 Addressing reporters, JDU spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said that Kalam in his book 'turning Point and Journey Through Challenges' has unveiled new facts related to the February 2005 decision to dissolve the Bihar Legislative Assembly and impose President's Rule
 niraj ne daawa ki farvari 2005 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke baad vidhaan sabha ko rajd supremeo ke dabaav main bhang kar diya gaya, jis par kendriya mantrimandal ke faisle evam raashtrapati kii sweekruti mil gayi thi

 He said that meanwhile, when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met Kalam in other matters, he informed him of his resignation in the light of the Supreme Court's remarks and also showed his resignation letter
 niraj ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ke us kathan ki kripaya aisa nahin karen tathaa iske kaaran araajaktaa failane or sarkaar ke gir sakati he or kalam ne istipha na dene kaa man banaaya
 He said that it is clear from the things mentioned in the book that UPA and Lalu Prasad also disrespected a moral person like Kalam, who lives on the basis of values
 niraj ne kaha ki kalam kii pustak main likhi baton se spasht hota he ki farvari 2005 ke baad bihar vidhansabha bhang kiya janaa, mantrimandal evam raashtrapati kaa muhar laganaa nyyochit nahin tha
 For this, the UPA and its RJD supremo Lalu Prasad should apologize to the people of Bihar, because they have done injustice to former President of the country, Kalam

 During this, Rahul Gandhi expressed regret over his statement 'chowkidar Chor Hai'

 Rahul Gandhi has expressed regret by filing an affidavit in the Supreme Court
 saath hi apane bayaan par safai dete hue congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha he kichunaavprachaar ke dauraanutejnaa main unke munh se yah bayaan nikal gaya
 Rahul Gandhi has admitted that the Supreme Court did not say that 'the watchman is a thief'

 unhone kaha ki chunaav prachaar kii uttejnaa ke dauraan rafel rivyuu maamle main supreme court kaa faisla aayaa, usee dauraan ye pratikriya unke munh se nikali thi
 But opponents have distorted his statement and project it with wrong motives
 rahul gandhi ne ye bhi kaha ki unhone media main ye bayaan ki ‘supreme court ne sahmati vyakt kii he ki piem modi ne rafel saude main bhrashtachar kiya he' un bayanon ke khilaaf tha jinamein unke virdohi 14 disambar se kehete aae hai ki supreme court ne clin chit di he

 The Supreme Court had asked Rahul to file a reply by 22 April and had asked for a hearing on 23 April

 But Congress President Rahul Gandhi quoted the Supreme Court as saying that the Supreme Court has also accepted that the watchman is a thief
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki court ne aadesh main aisa kuch nahin he isliye ye court kii avmaananaa he
 The Congress President in his constituency Amethi had said, “I want to thank the Supreme Court

 ' Satish Poonia became the new president of Rajasthan BJP with the background of the Union, the first time the leader of the Jat community, sitting on the post of bjp's state president, after two months, the BJP finally got its state president in Rajasthan
 dhai maheene se suune pade bijepi daftar main aaj raunak lauti or bijepi kaaryakartaaon ne aatishbaajee kar or pataakhe chhodkar apana adhyaksh milane kaa jashn manaaya 
 BJP MLA Satish Poonia, who comes from a Sangh background, has been made the state president of Rajasthan
 madan laal saini ke dehanth ke baad se hi rajasthan main bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh kaa pad khaali chal rahaa tha
 There was tremendous lobbying among BJP leaders for this post in Delhi
 isse pehle satish punia ko bijepi ne sadsyta abhiyaan kaa prabharee banaaya tha or mana ja rahaa he ki in 2 maheenon main satish punia ne kaaphi acha kaam kiya
 In view of this, the central leadership decided to give Poonia the command of the state
 rajasthan main vasundhara raaje kaa ek majboot gut he jo apane pasand kaa pradesh adhyaksh rajasthan main banvaanaa chahta tha magar bijepi ne vasundhara raaje ke dhur virdohi maane jane vaale sangh prishthbhumi ke bijepi netaa satish punia ko pradesh adhyaksh pad par chunaa he
 However, Vasundhara Raje has congratulated Satish Poonia on the phone
 bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh pad par pehali baar koi jat samudaay kaa netaa baitha he
 Satish Poonia said, 'there is no big or small mine in BJP
 ham apane rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah or pradhanmantri narendra modi ke nirdeshon ke anusaar rajasthan main party kaa kaam karenge
 In this party, small workers have got respect
 As far as the Jat caste is concerned, in the Lok Sabha elections this time in the BJP, all castes got votes
 yah acchhee baat he ki main garib kisaan parivaar se aata hum
 On the question of Vasundhara Raje having a separate camp, she said that if there is a leader in the party, then he has some followers, but in the end everyone is a party worker and everyone has to follow what the party decides
 bijepi main bhairon singh shekhavat ke samay se rajputon kaa dabadabaa rahaa he
 Despite the resentment of the Rajputs, it has been considered a large section of the Rajput party
 haalanki, vasundhara raaje ko laakar bijepi ne rajya main experiment kiya tha or rajput kii beti or jat kii bahu ke naam se unhone jaaton ko apane saath joda tha
 But still more of the Jat community votes remain with the Congress
 aise main jat samudaay se aane vaale satish punia ko bijepi kaa pradesh adhyaksh banaakar bijepi ne congress ke paramparaagat vot bank main send lagane kii koshish kii he

 co / st1fyz7ysa yah pehali baar he jab bhaajapaapaschim bengalake musalamaanon ko lubhaana chaahati he
 Muslims constitute 30% of the state's electorate
 yah jaanate hue ki mamata banerjee kii ''muslim tushtikaran kii raajnneeti'' par hamalaa karne ke baavjood hindu matadaataaon ke paryaapt vot party ko nahin mil rahe the, bhartiya janata party ne ab 'udaar' musalamaanon tak pahunchane kaa faisla kiya he
 On 19 February, the party's state unit is hosting a state-level conference for the Muslim community, titled 'narendra Modi and the development of minorities'
 muslim buddhijiviyon, doctor, vakil or technocrates jaise peshewaron or anya logon ke saath dharmik netaaon ko isamen hissedari karne ke liye aamantran bheje gaye hai
 Speakers will include former journalist and Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta, state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh and Trinamool Congress rebel leader Mukul Roy
 bhaajapa mahas chiv debashri roy chedhri kaa kahana he ki yah musalamaanon ko un sabhi kaamon ke bare main 'suchit or shikshit' karne ke liye he, jo pradhanmantri ne unhen 'shashakt' banane ke liye kiye hai
 For example, she cites the "historic decision" related to triple talaq, which has come as a boon for millions of poor Muslim women
 na to congress or na hi kisi anya sarkaar ne aisa karne kii himmat dikhaai, bhale hi unhen musalamaanon ke dost ke rup main dekha ja rahaa ho
 "the time has come," Chaudhary says, when Muslims will know what the BJP government has achieved under Modi

 She says that this is real development, not the appeasement policy of Congress and Trinamool Congress

 The first Parliament session of the seventeenth Lok Sabha will begin on 17 June
 is sansad satr main satta paksh kii benchon se lekar vipaksh kii benchon par bhi bahut kuch badla-badla sa nazar aayega
 After winning 300 seats in this election, bjp's first row seats will increase from 10 to 12
 darasal, jis party ko jitani siten milti hai uske hisaab se hi us par party ko pehali pankti main sthaan miltaa he
 Last time, TMC had 33 mps, so Sudeep Bandhopadhyay used to sit in the first row, along with bjd's Bhrithari Mehtab in the first row as he was a BJD MP
 ediemke ke 37 saansad the isliye unke paas dipti spikar pad bhi tha isliye em thambidurai sabase vipakshi dal ke netaa mallikarjun khadge ke saath baithte the
 He was accompanied by another AIADMK seat with Bhrithari Mehtab and Sudeep Bandhopadhyay
 mulaayam singh yadav or purv pradhanmantri echdi devgauda ko pehali pankti main sthaan diya gaya tha
 This time HD Deve Gowda has lost
 pehali pankti main modi ke saath shah ko mili jagahsatta paksh kii pehali pankti kii pehali bench par sabase pehle piem modi or unke baad grahamantri amit shah baithenge
 The number two bench of the ruling party will be sitting first by Defense Minister Rajnath Singh, followed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Foreign Minister s Jaishankar
 pichhali sarkaar main piem modi ke saath rajnath singh baithte the
 On the second bench Arun Jaitley, LK Advani, then Sushma Swaraj and finally Nitin Gadkari used to sit with him
 ab arun jetali, sushamaa swaraj or laalkrishna adwani satta paksh kii bench par dikhaai nahin denge kyonki laalkrishna adwani or sushamaa swaraj ne chunaav nahin ladaa he
 On the third bench Murali Manohar Joshi, Ram Vilas Paswan, Uma Bharti used to sit
 murali manohar joshi or uma bharti ne bhi is baar chunaav nahin ladaa hai
 Now he can be replaced by Ravi Shankar Prasad and Narendra Singh Tomar
 yani ki teesri bench par ravishankar prasad, narendra singh tomars ke saath ramvilas paswan nazar aaenge
 tdp's Ashok Gajapathi Raju used to sit with Anant Geet on the fourth bench
 is chunaav main anant geete chunaav haar gaye hai, unki jagah cabinet main arvind saavant ko jagah mili he
 At the same time, TDP has suffered badly
 yani ab arvind saavant ke saath wiesar ke sansadeey dal ke netaa baithenge
 Congress will get 3 seats in the opposition, so even this time the Congress has not got enough seats so that they can get the post of Leader of Opposition but as the largest opposition party they will get three seats in the first row
 ab dekhnaa he ki congress sansadeey dal kaa netaa kise chunati he, sonia gandhi ke saath rahul gandhi ko pehali pankti main jagah mil sakati he
 Now it remains to be seen whether TMC, BJD, DMK and TRS will be ranked in the first line
 lambey samay baad aisa hoga jab laalkrishna adwani, echdi devgauda, sushamaa swaraj, mallikarjun khadge loksabhaa main nazar nahin aaenge

 Film Name: shoreguldirector: Pranav Kumar Singh and Jeetendra tiwaristar Cast: Ashutosh Rana, Jimmy Shergill, Sanjay Suri, Narendra Jha, Suha Gogen, Deepdas Rana, Hiten Tejwani, Ejaz Khan Duration: 2 hours 12 minutes Certificates: u / a Rating: 2 Starhar Ek a lot of Hindi films have been made on political backdrops over the decade
 ek baar phir se 'shorgul' ke madhyam se isi mudde ko cash karne kii koshish kii gai he
 How is this film 'shorgul' surrounded by controversy? Let us review-story: -the story of the film is from Malihabad near Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, where a village Chaudhary (ashutosh Rana), an MLA Ranjit Om Bhaiya (jimmy Shergill) and a hindu-muslim family live
 choudhary kaa betaa raghu(aniruddh dave)or paas ke muslim ghar kii ladki jainab (suha gozan) bachapan se hi ek duusare ke pakke dost hote hai
 He also goes to college together
 jab jainab kaa nikaah, saleem (hiten tejavaani) se tay hota he uske baad saleem ke bhai mustakeen (ejaj khan) kii maujuudagi se kuch aisa hota he jisaki vajah se raghu kii maut ho jaati he
 The death of a Hindu boy triggers hindu-muslim riots throughout Malihabad
 ise raajnneetik rang bhi diya jane lagata he or aakhirkaar film kaa ek tipical ant hota he
 Script: - The story of the film is a political drama which you have been watching for many decades
 yahaan lav story or politaks ko mix karke darshane kii koshish kii gai he
 The dialogues have a lot of power but the story is the same old one, which has less attraction
 likhaawat aapako 90 ke dashak kii yaad dilaati he jise or behatar kiya ja saktaa tha
 Although it is only a 132-minute film, but by the time it starts to look long
 screenple or bhi tite kiya ja saktaa tha
 Acting: - The Mujahra of the dialogues and acting of actor Ashutosh Rana will be seen once again
 vahijimmy shergilaka kaam bhi saraahneey he
 Actress Suha Gogen has also performed well
 ejaj khan, hiten tejavaani, narendra jha, sanjay suri or dipadas rana kaa kaam bhi sahaj he
 Weak Link: - The weak link of the film is its stereotyped story which needed to be worked on even more
 film ko shuruyaat ke dedh ghante main itnaa failaa diya jaataa he kiakhir main ise samet paanaa kaaphi mushkil lagata he
 Due to which the climax starts to look quite clichéd
 vahiin sanjay suri, narendra jha, jaise actors ko kaaphi chota role diya gaya tha, jo nyaaysangat nahin lagata or bheed main kho jaataa he
 Music: - The music of the film is correct which leads the story in the right way
 kapil sibbal ne bhi gane likhe hai vahiin lalit pandit ke banaae hue geet bhi achche lagate hai
 Why see: -if you like films like Ashutosh Rana, Jimmy Shergill on the basis of well-known artists and political issues, then you can definitely watch once

 If you are giving more time in office, then do not think that this is the plus point for you
 darasal ye aapke liye negative point bhi sabit ho saktaa he
 We are telling you why not to do excessive work in office 1

 company aise logon ko smart varkar nahin maanati, jo tay samay seemaa ke bheetar apana kaam nahin kar pate
 Therefore, giving more time to your office does not define you as hardworking
 pehali baar main hi CA final nikaalani he to kuch aisi ho taiyaari3
 You may give extra time to the office work of your choice, but do not be tempted that the office will give you extra money

 If you are doing office work at home, then it is understood that you lack time management and you work slow

 Sitting in the office every day for a long time also proves that you do not work

 When you start giving more time in office, people also assume that your personal life is not going well

 rafel deal ko lekar desh main vivaad khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahaa
 While Congress is seeking the formation of a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) in Parliament over the contentious deal, Arun Shourie and Prashant Bhushan, including former finance minister Yashwant Sinha, have filed a review petition in the Supreme Court on the Rafale dispute on Wednesday
 saath hi khuli adaalat main punarvichaar sunwaayee kii maang kii he
 The petition filed in the Supreme Court on behalf of these three people said that there are many errors in the judgment
 supreme court kaa faisla sarkaar kii ore se ek silband bina dastakhat vaale note main kiye gaye galat daavon par nirbhar he jo prakritik nyaay ke siddhant kaa ulanghan he
 This petition also states that after the decision in the case has been reserved, many new facts have come to light, on the basis of which there is a need to go to the root of the case
 court khaarij kar chukaa he pehle kii yachikaayensupreme court ne pichley saal disambar memraffel dealpar jaanch se judi sabhi yachikaaon ko khaarij kar diya tha
 On Rafael's price, the court had said, "the details of the price have been shared with the CAG (CAG) and the PAG has been examined by the CAG report
 ' court ke faisle ke baad piesi (lok lekha samiti) ke adhyaksh mallikarjun khadge ne aisi kisi report ke saamne aane se inkaar kiya or lok lekha samiti se anurodh kiya ki atorni general or sieji ko yah baat poochne ke liye talab karen ki rafel saude par sieji kii report kab sansad main pesh kii gai
 On the controversy over the sending of the CAG report to the PAC, the central government presented its explanation and said that we did not mislead the court, but the court misunderstood our argument

 centre ne apane halafname mensaaf kar diya ki vah yah nahin kah rahaa ki kaig report kaa piesi ne pareekshan kiya tha yaa sampadit hisse ko sansad ke saamne rakhaa gaya
 Meanwhile, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewalane on Rafale Deal released an audio on Wednesday

 Aparna is the 22nd member of Mulayam's family in politics
 is par wo kahati hai, parivaar ko lekar sirf yadav family par jokes kyon banate hai
 Many leaders have sons and daughters in politics
 agar vakil kaa betaa vakil, doctor kaa betaa doctor, ejeeniyar kaa betaa ejeeniyar ban jaataa he to koi kuch nahin kahata
 Why this question is raised only for politicians
 26 saal kii aparnaa, mulaayam singh or unki duusari patni sadhana gupta ke bete pratik kii patni hai
 Prateek is not in politics and does business
 kehete hai ki mulaayam, pratik ko raajnneeti main nahin laana chaahate the taaki akhilesh ke raste main koi rukaawat nahin aae
 But his wife wanted that if Prateek cannot get into politics, then at least Aparna should get a ticket
 unka chayan isi kaa nateeja he
 Aparna, 26, is the wife of Prateek, son of Mulayam Singh and his second wife, Sadhana Gupta
 pratik siyasat main nahin hai or bijness karte hai
 Mulayam, it is said, did not want to bring the symbol in politics so that there was no obstruction in the way of Akhilesh
 lekin unki patni chaahati thim ki agar pratik raajnneeti main nahin aa sakate to kam se kam aparnaa ko tikat jarur mili

 bispi supremeo mayawati ne twit kiya ki supreme court ke nirdesh ke baad centre ko gambhir hokar mob linching par alag se deshvyapee kanoon ab tak jarur bana lenaa chahie tha

 Mayawati's tweet on mob lynching: BSP supremo Mayawati tweeted, 'mob lynching has emerged as a terrible disease all over the country, especially the intention and policy of the BJP governments not to establish the rule of law, so that now Not only the people of Dalit, tribal and religious minority society, but also people of common society and police are becoming victims

 - Mayawati (@mayawati) July 13, 2019 Also Mayawati wrote in the next tweet, 'after the Supreme Court's directive, the Center should have made a separate nationwide law on mob lynching by now, but the case of Maab Lynching like Lokpal Even in the center, the center is indifferent and a weak-willed government is being proved
 aise me upi vidhi ayog kii pahal swagatogya he
 After the Supreme Court's directive, the Center should have seriously made a separate nationwide law on Maab Linching till now, but like the Lokpal, in the case of Maab Lynching, the Center is indifferent and a weak-willed government is being proved
 aise me upi vidhi ayog kii pahal swagatogya he
 - Mayawati (@mayawati) July 13, 2019 Before Mayawati, senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid gave a big statement on mob lynching
 salmaan khurshid ne kaha ki mujhe lagata he ki dilli ke un ilaakon main dar kaa koi maahaul nahin he, jahaan ham rahete hai yaa kaam karte hai, lekin haa chote shaharon or gaanvon main iskaa dar jarur he
 It is the responsibility of Indians to put an end to this fear
 Salman khurshid,congress on mob lynching incidents: i think there is no atmosphere of fear in areas of Delhi where we live or work, but yes there is a feeling in small towns and villages
 It is the responsibility of every Indian to assuage these fears

 But this time Garba is in discussion for a different reason
 darasal, is baar garba ke kai aayojakon ne kathor niyam tay kiye hai

 It is only one of the many sanctions that Garba organizers and the local Hindu organization Yuva Morcha have imposed

 jo bhi garba kaarykram main pravesh karegaa, us par khud par gomutra kaa halkaa chhidkaav karnaa hoga
 Also it will be mandatory to apply tilak on the forehead
 aayojakon kaa daawa he ki pichley saal bhi garba main anya dharm ke logon kii entry bain kii gai thi
 This year it is being implemented more rigorously
 vaise mandavi taluka main garba ke dauraan kareeb 6 bade kaarykram yojit kiye jate hai

 Meanwhile, during the rehearsal, a video of some jawans falling from Dhruv helicopter created a sensation
 reharsal ke dauraan kuch jawan hawa main se hi gir gaye
 However, the army has issued a statement that it is clear that no jawan has been hurt, all are safe
 is haadase kii jaanch ke bhi aadesh die gaye hai
 Let me tell you that after the Uri attack, India had made a surgical strike by entering Pakistan
 us dauraan dhruv helicopter kaa hi istemaal kiya gaya tha
 The chopper was deployed near the border for the withdrawal of troops crossing the loc
 javaanon ko surakshit bachaa kar laane main isse kaaphi madad mili thi
 Dhruv helicopter is manufactured in India, it is a native helicopter
 kaise dhruv par baithkar kiya tha pakistan ko nestanabood
 
 
 The Bharti Army had crossed the Line of Control on the night of 28–29 September 2016 and carried out surgical strikes on seven terror camps
 sargical strike se kuch dinon pehle uri hamale main 19 jawan shahid ho gaye the
 Only after this, India made up its mind to teach a lesson to the terrorists who attacked like cowards
 bharat ke jaanbaaj sainikon ne elosi ke paar jaakar aatankiyon ke thikaanon ko tahas-nahas kar diya
 At that time, at 12 o'clock in the night, 25 commandos of 4 and 9 paras, from Poonch, advanced light helicopter 'dhruv', entered Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 niyantran rekha ke paar helicopter ne in javaanon ko ek sunsaan jagah utaar diya
 These commandos decided to crawl the distance of about three kilometers, amid fears of firing by the Pakistani army
 desh main tabaahi machaane ke liye yahaan aatankiyon ke launch pads bhimber, kel, tattapani or lipa ilaakon main sthit the
 In a blink of an eye, the commandos attacked the terrorists with grenades
 afra-tafari failte hi smoke grenade ke saath tabadatod firing kii or dekhte hi dekhte 38 aatankwaadiyon ko dher kar diya gaya
 Two Pakistani army personnel were also killed in the attack
 kyon khaas he dhruv? # dhruv ko chetak or chita helicopter se bhi acha mana jaataa he
 Chetak and Cheetah have a single engine while Dhruv uses two power turboshoft engines
 jo ki 1341 BHP prati helicopter power ke hai
 # Dhruv helicopter weighs around 3 tonnes

 Due to the low monsoon, the worst situation is in central India, where so far, 63 percent less rainfall has been received
 is ilaake main chaaval kii paidaavaar sabase zyada hoti he
 Northeast India also received 22 percent less rainfall
 pashchimi uttar pradesh main abtak barish saamaanya ke mukaable 71 fisadi kam hui he
 The problems of the Modi government may increase due to the low monsoon

 If we want a sustained high economic growth rate, increase our access to electricity as per need, want to guarantee food security and employment and develop high technology products, resource efficiency is an important area in which to improve India Will happen
 bharat ko aarthik takat banane ke liye in saare muddon par lambii avadhi ke liye kaam karnaa hoga
 Therefore, resource efficiency is not only a matter limited to the Ministry of Finance, but it is also an issue related to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Agriculture, Water Resources, Energy, Coal, Food and Chemicals, Renewable Energy, Forest and Environment
 isamen vaanijya or udyog or videsh mantralay kaa zikr karne kii jarurat nahin he
 Three factors are our important priorities in the reform process
 pehla, tel or gas kaa sahi myanon main sangrakshan karne kii jarurat he
 Although India's performance on energy efficiency is relatively better than other major energy consuming countries, it is dependent on higher imports of oil and gas for its own needs
 tel or gas kaa aayaat desh kii kul maang ke 90 fisadi ke baraabar pahunchane ke asaar hai
 We are more dependent on West Asia than other major oil importers
 ham 63 fisadi aayaat pashchim asia se karte hai, jabaki china 46 fisadi
 If there is any kind of crisis in West Asia and the prices of hydrocarbons rise then it will increase our import bill by $ 118 billion (rs
 5,90,000 crore)
 ) se bhi zyada kaa ijapha hoga
 At the same time, domestic production of gas is also not in line with the estimates
 aise main aayaat bill badhegaa
 What can be done then? In short, saving your resources is beneficial

 or ab jab bhi koi aapse aapke akele rahane par sawaal uthaae yaa bhedbhaav kare to is line ko sunaakar uskaa munh fouran band kar den
 Senior psychologist Pratibha Yadav says, "if you are satisfied with your decisions, don't be influenced by the opinions of others

 koi bhi jindagi bina rumaniyat or bina jhamelon ke nahin hoti
 Ask someone who is staring at your single status, why do you never have such restrictions? Never mind be with yourself sirf aap hon or aap hi apni jodidar hon
 "she says," Marriage is a stage, not everyone wants to reach it
 apni jindagi chunane kaa har vyakti ko puraa adhikaar he
 So if your mind is not to be mingled with someone else, then what harm in it should you mingle with yourself

 Regarding girls, boys do not just live in all kinds of fantasy
 ladakiyon kii khubsuurati ke alaava ladke kai baar ladakiyon ke vyavhaar ke bare main bahut alag tarah kii baaten sochate hai
 Many boys hate some of the habits of girls
 bhale hi ve ise apni dost ke saamne jaahir naa karen lekin vah man main jarur kuch naa kuch sochate rahete hai
 Let's know how boys think about girls
 
 
 1
 Man speaks a lot: Boys think that every girl is going to speak
 to iskaa ek hi matlab he ki chup rahane vaali yaa santulit maatra main bolne vaali ladakiyon se aapkaa paala nahin padaa he
 There are also girls who know when, where and how much they have to speak
 2
 Replay of makeup: Girls are teased even after seeing their moon-like appearance repeatedly
 lekin aisi bhi bahut si ladki hai, jo bina mechap apni maasoom muskaan se kadi dhoop main bhi barish jaisi thandak dene kaa boota rakhti hai
 3
 aao bahan chugali karen:gharon kii balakani se latakate hue yaa phir bich class main akasar ladkiyaan samaajik muddon par charchaa karti hui dekhi jaati hai, jise duniya ne chugali kaa naam diya he
 In such a situation, we should not forget even those girls who keep their sorrows in mind
 4
 Shopping, Shopping, Shopping: Shopping is understood to be the biggest need for girls with boyfriends to reduce tension
 ladakiyon ke haathon main rashan ke jhole kii tarah latakate hue shopping bags ko unki pahchaan se jod liya jaataa he
 5
 driving main lup-lup:dhooma filmon se prerana lene vaale log ladakiyon ko driving main behatar nahin maanate hai
 But in such a situation, we forget the space travel of Sunita Williams and Kalpana Chawla
 6
 Time to set up: The entire moon is also seen after 30 days
 lekin ladakiyon ke taiyaar hone main lagane vaale maamuli teen-chaar ghanton ko jaalim duniya sajane main zyada vakt se jodakar dekhati he
 Due to the beauty of the same girls, no one sees their friends in the house
 7
 It is important for a girl to be a cook: It is a common belief that the way of the boys' heart passes through the stomach and girls have access to the heart
 isliye unke liye khaanaa bananaa jaruri samajha jaataa he
 8
 pink matlab ladki:gulabi gaalon ko gulabi kapado se jodakar dekhne waalon kaa maananaa he ki ladakiyon kaa pasandida rang gulabi hota he
 Hindi films and Archies Gallery contribute significantly to this
 9
 Many cry: Most girls are said to cry a lot
 vahiin rone vaali ladki agar relationships todane kii baat kah de, to ladke khud bhi aansu bahaane lagate hai
 10
 prapoj karne main garib:ladako lagata he ki pyaar kaa izhaar karne kaa daayitv unhi ke jimme hi hota he
 Girls are usually told how girls can propose
 lekin is par koi dhyaan nahin detaa ki prapoj karne ke baad rishte ko lambey samay tak chalaane kaa kaam bhi to ladkiyaan hi karti hai
 11
 golgappas, chater-patar:jindagi kaa majaa khattey main he or is tarah se jindagi kaa khattapen ke saath majaa lete hue sabase zyada ladkiyaan dekhi jaati hai
 These believers forget that taste of their own tongue, when they enter the wedding pandals, they pick up the Golgappa, the goose leaf
 12
 i Love This Taddy, Chocolate: Every girl likes to have a taddy like a mother-in-law, mother-in-law, by sticking around her neck
 lekin ladke ise ladki ko impress karne kaa jariya samajhane lage hai
 13
 aaj nakad kal udhaar:ladako ko lagata he ki ladkiyaan hotel, restaurent main bill kaa bhugtan karne se bachati hai
 If you think so too, then approach your house, when you ask for money from your sister or best friend
 ladkiyaan paise bachaati hai to aapako hi detii hai
 14
 pyaar nahin paisa:mujhe pyaar nahin paisa chahie
 Every boy feels that girls have to marry only boys with money

 pakistan ke purv captain mohammad yusuf ne pisibi par cricketron ke kariyar ke saath khilne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Yusuf said, 'there are some people in the cricket board who have vested interests and high importance
 unhen isse koi fark nahin padataa ki unke faisle pakistan cricket ko nuksaan bhi pahunchaa sakate hai
 i have seen many such examples in the past
 teen saal pehle rashtriya team se nikaale gaye yusuf ne senior khilaadiyon kii kadra nahin karne ke liye bhi board ko aade haathon liya
 "he said," a great player like Wasim Akram did not retire but this system forced him to leave

 One of the reasons we have not been able to perform well as a cricket team is that we do not respect our senior players
 'unhone kaha, 'samasya yah he ki board videshiyon ko lakhon rupee dene ko taiyaar hai lekin jab hamaare khilaadi isaki maang karte hai to board dena nahin chahta

 ayodhya main ram mandir banane ke faisle ke saath hi ab is baat par raajnneeti shuru ho gai he ki iskaa shrey koun le
 Obviously, the BJP sitting at the center would like to take the biggest credit for this, but the Congress has also come up tight to give a tough fight to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the name of Ram
 uttar pradesh kii bijepi sarkaar ke jawaab main madhyapradesh kii congress sarkaar ne bhi ayodhya kii tarj par ab orchha ko viksit karne kii yojana taiyaar kar lee he
 In this, the Kamal Nath government has indicated to start work soon on the plan to develop the famous Ramraja temple in Orchha to Orchha city and the Betwa river flowing from here and its ghats
 paryaton nagari banane par jorkamalanath sarkaar ke dharmasv mantri pisi sharma ne 'ajtak' se baat karte hue bataaya ki 'ram kii nagari orchha ko paryaton nagari ke rup main viksit karne ke liye mukhyamantri kamalnath gambhir hai isliye jahaan saalon se vikaas nahin hua vahaan hamaari sarkaar aate hi sabase pehle ek pratikshalay banwaaya gaya he
 Kamal Nath Ji is a spiritual person and will leave no stone unturned for development in the city of Ramaraja
 darasal, ayodhya or orchha kaa gaharaa naata he
 It is said that in Ayodhya, there are lively memories of Baal Leelas of Ramlala, whereas in Orchha, Shri Ram sits as a king
 ram yahaan ke janajivan kii saanson main dhadkate hai

 donon hi paksh ise do majboot netaaon ke bich kareebi vyaktigat sambandhon ko jaahir karne ke maukey ke rup main dekh rahe hai
 Although Xi'an is not really hometown of Xi
 shi kaa janm beijing main hua
 His father, the Communist Party's revolutionary leader Xi Zhangshun, was born in Phuping, a small village 100 km from Bhai Xian
 pehali najar main phoping shanshi praant ke har gaanv kii tarah hi harabhra dikhataa he
 There, amidst the fields of green maize-tides, the expansion of mustard yellow flowers and the small dusty hills all around create a panoramic view
 lekin pichley dhai saal se, jab se shi communist party ke mahasachiv bane hai, yah puraa ilaaka kaaphi badal gaya he
 As he completed his first year as the head of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi revealed his perspective as to where he wanted to see China in the world
 madhya asia ke daure par shi ne pracheen silk root kaa zikr kiya or elaan kiya ki china aarthik gatividhiyon ke nae silk root kaa nirmaan karegaa
 In this way, he expressed the importance of China in the superpowers of the world
 iske maheene bhar baad dakshin asia main shi ne kaha ki is nae aarthik kshetra ke samaantar nauvahan silk root bhi taiyaar kiya jayega, jo china ko asia-prashanth or hind mahaasaagar se jodega
 This plan led to an eye for Xian and there was new investment
 shiaan main videshi nivesh aakarshith karne ke liye nae technological jone ko vistaar diya gaya he
 There is also a plan for a software park which according to local authorities is being built on the "lines of Bengaluru"
 phoping kii “deshbhakt shiksha kii paathshaala” dashak bhar se pehle banaai gai thi
 It is now the second major stop for tourists after the famous Terracotta Warriors (sculptures of warriors) of Xian
 yahaan ke mujium main shi parivaar kaa itihaas dikhaaya jaataa he
 a shop next to the shop sells ceramic plates containing the statue of Xi Zhangshun and photographs of young Xi and the first lady Peng Liyuan
 jab modi shiaan main shi ke saath tahal rahe honge or sitambar main sabarmati ke kinare hui baatcheet ko aage badha rahe honge to unhen yah ehsaas shiddat se hoga ki chaar saal pehle bataur gujarat ke mukhyamantri ve jis china ke daure par aae the, vah ab kaaphi badal chukaa he
 Unlike China's former leadership, Xi has made a strong impression on power from his perspective after taking office in March 2013
 unhone party, sarkaar or fouj kii puri kaman apane haath main kar lee he or nirnay prakriya kaa puri tarah kendrikaran kar diya he
 Xi's message in his country is "the great revival of the Chinese nation
 ” unhone bhrashtachar par kathor ravaiya apanaaya or majboot tathaa saaf-suthri sarkaar banane par jor diya
 On the foreign front, they are conveying the message of a new-born China, that is, the days of Deng Xiaoping's slogan that "wait for the right time, hide your power
" ”shi kii yojana main bharatpichley 12 maheene main shi kii sarkaar ne yah spasht kar diya ki “aarthik kshetra or silk root” kaa vichaar mahaj baton tak hi simit nahin he
 The government is rapidly preparing a treasury of about $ 100 billion
 40 arab dollar kaa silk road fund china ke samarthan se bane nae asia infrastracchar investment bank (eiibi) main madad karegaa
 It is clear from the Silk Road project that the new leadership of China wants to see their country in the world
 yani china is kshetra main pramukh aarthik or bhu-rajnatik takat kii tarah ubharegaa
 Where will India be in this place? Indeed, the mind of China's foreign policy strategists is America, not India
 china ke videsh niti visheshgyon ke mutabik, silk road kii pahal kai myanon main asia main america ke aarthik or samrik dabadabe ko kam karne kii koshish kaa hissaa he
 Hu Shisheng, director of the Center for South, South East Asia at the China Institute for Contemporary International Relations (CICIR), a government institution, says, "america now has dominance in the asia-pacific region
" agar china kii aarthik kshetra or road nirmaan kii pariyojna kaamyaab ho jaati he to isse america kaa dabadabaa shartiya taur par ghatega
 "the rapid economic zone and road construction project that China has taken forward on the work, and especially the AIIB, are shocked by the knowledge of these matters
 america kii is bank ke bahishkaar kii koshish naakaam ho gai or vah akelaa pad gaya
 He continued to shake hands and his colleagues from Britain to South Korea and Australia hastened to become founding members of the bank within China's deadline
 china kii rajdhani main ek pashchimi kutanyik kehete hai, “eiibi beijing ke liye badi kootnithik vijay he
 America was left alone
 ”shi ne khud pichley saal may main shanghai main asia suraksha shikhar sammelan main videsh niti par apane pehle bade bhaashan main kuch aisa hi abhas diya tha
 He called for the creation of a new regional security system operating in Asia
 shi ne saaf kaha, “asia ke logon ko hi asia kaa intjaam dekhnaa he
 "but Beijing's problem is that this sentiment is not evident in every country across Asia
 china ke ubhaar se japan, philippines or vietnam sashankit hai or ye desh america ke or kareeb pahunch gaye hai
 Especially in the case of these three countries, China has taken a tough stand in the maritime dispute
 ek vajah yah bhi he ki vah sochataa he ki america unhen bhadkaa rahaa he
 The india-china bilateral relationship has its own importance, but for China to keep India with it is also seen as a need for its ongoing competition with the US
 ek saakshaatkaar main chini adhikariyon or visheshgyon ne kaha ki unhen nahin lagata ki modi jaisaa “majboot netaa” bharat ko shkisi desh kaa mohara” banane degaa
 However, some Chinese fear that Modi is taking India closer to Washington and Tokyo
 yah ashanka bharat ko eiibi kaa sansthaapak sadsy or silk road pariyojna main saajheedaar banane ke liye china kii jaldbaaji main bhi dikhaai padati he
 India accepted the offer to become a founding member of AIIB, but is adopting some cautious approach to the proposal to become a partner in Silk Road
 bharat kii ore se is pariyojna ke or byoron kii jaankaree maangi gai he
 China has also taken a different stand on the border dispute with India
 usne japan or philippines ke khilaaf to kaaphi kadaa rukh apana rakhaa he jabaki bharat-china seemaa vivaad ko ateet kaa boj bataakar kuch naram rukh dikhaa rahaa he
 In fact, in China, in a sense, India is being considered as a middle player in competition with America for more regional dominance
 yani aisa desh jisase china sahyog or hode kaa pechida rishta banaae rakhega lekin vah yah bhi maanata he ki uske kshetreey dabadabe ko kaayam karne main bharat ahm khilaadi he
 For example, India can be a useful ally of China in improving global trade treaties, financial institutions and reducing the West's pressure on climate change
 china ke videsh mantralay main asia vibhaag ke up-mahanideshak tathaa bharat sambandhi vishyon ke mukhya prabharee huyang shilion kaa kahana he ki china bharat se apane rishton ko “dashakon nahin, hajaaron saal” ke sandarbh main dekhtaa he
 He says, "in the past we have gone through a high, low, comfortable and uncomfortable phase together
 ham sochate hai ki ab hamaare paas apni do mahaan sabhyataaon ke punarutthan kaa mauka he
 "hu of CICIR believes that if China wants to establish a larger role in Asia and realize Xi's vision, it needs to take India on a conditional basis, not India Leave it to remain suspicious of China's plans in its neighborhood
 ve kehete hai, “china ke liye behatar yahi he ki vah bharat ke saath apane sahyog main aisa santulan kaayam kare ki bharat chaiyn mahasoos kare, vah china ko sweekaar kare
 If India stays apart from the Silk Road, then it is not a problem, but if India stops the roads then it will be a problem
 main nahin samajhataa ki bharat aisa karegaa
 "the biggest setback before China's foreign policy experts before modi-xi Sankatmodi's visit is what will be the impact of two strong leaders in India and China for the first time in two decades?" Former diplomat Yang Wenchang, head of the Chinese People's Institute for Foreign Affairs, an influential think tank in the sprawling courtyard of the old palace, points out that the last time the two leaders came to power in both countries with a huge mandate, India and China reached their old border dispute
 Had reached close to solve unhone kaha, “mujhe vyaktigat taur par ummid he ki do majboot netaa hi is samasya kaa hal nikaal sakate hai
 As a diplomat in the late 1980s, i am witness that Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Deng (who was also a strong leader) had an opportunity to solve the problem
 deng ne kaha, “ham pashchim ke hisse par kuch samjhauta karte hai, aap purab ke hisse par kuch jhuko to hamaari simaaen nai ho sakati hai
 "we also made an offer on our behalf but Prime Minister Gandhi could not give any answer
 ” lekin beijing main har koi isse sahamat nahin he
 a former diplomat says, "two strong leaders can resolve the dispute, but two strong leaders also do not want to be seen compromising at home
" isliye yah kahana mushkil he ki hal nikaala ja saktaa he
 "where Modi's India fits in Xi's mathematics will depend on the extent to which the two leaders take the relationship forward
" kya shaq-shubahon se ab bhi simit rishte main koi bada badlaav aayega? siisiiar ke hu kehete hai, “ham audyogic parkon, haai speed rail trek ke nirmaan main pragati dekh chuke hai
 It is indeed a big progress
 aapke pradhanmantri ne kaha he ki bharat or china ek aatma, do sharir kii tarah hai
 This is a very encouraging and important statement
 shi sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki bharat kesath thos rishte kaayam karnaa behad jaruri he
 Personally, i believe that there will be no major bottlenecks in the coming years as both countries are emphasizing on development and there is a lot shared between them for this purpose
 hamaari ore se, meraa maananaa he ki ham modi kii majboot sarkaar kaa puraa laabh uthaanaa chahenge
 There is no doubt that this is a big political opportunity and we are also hoping that Modi will win the election comfortably for the second term

 comtelipona nan: 044-42121778 In Gujarat, on Monday, all textile industries, including Ahmedabad and Surat, held a one-day strike
 kapadaa udyog par bajet main lagaaye gayi do pratishat atirikt exise duty kaa virodh karne ke liye ek din kaa band rakhaa gaya
 According to an estimate, there are about 11,000 Garments manufacturers in Gujarat and about 4 lakh people are associated with this business
 gujarat garment manuphaccharer association kaa kahana he ki ek kapadaa banakar taiyaar hota he tab tak wo kareeb 13 se 14 alag-alag jagahon se hokar aata he
 Different craftsmen are involved in the work of making and cutting of colors and different parts and then sewing, and this business is completely unorganized
 aise main 2 pratishat exise duty in sabhi staron par lagu hote hote ek utpaada par kareeb 8 se 10 pratishat tak padegaa
 First of all, this industry is facing a slowdown and if inflation increases further, its problems will increase further
 gujarat garment manuphaccharer association ke pramukh vijay purohit kaa kahana he ki ek auki vibhaag bad jane se isamen bhrashtachar behad bad jayega
 When Inspector Raj has come, corruption has increased
 association ke secretary arpan shah kaa kahana he ki modi ji ke sutara mek in india ko agar koi sachmuch sarthak karata he to wo he kapadaa udyog
 In such a situation, if the textile industry is unhappy, then the government's dreams will not be fulfilled
 ek anumaan ke mutabik desh bhar main krishi ke baad kapadaa udyog hi sabase zyada, kareeb 11 karod logon ko rojgaar detaa he
 The comments mahatvapurn he ki sona-chaandi ke gahanon par 1 pratishat atirikt exise duty kaa virodh johari pichley 12 dinon se lagaataar kar hi rahe hai or iskaa virodh karne ke liye deshbhar main bemiyadi hadtaal par hai
 This has caused a loss of about Rs 72,000 crore to the business so far
 mahatvapurn he ki narendra modi sarkaar ke bajet kaa virodh sabase mukhar tareeke se unke griharajya gujarat main hi ho rahaa he
 The first jewelers strike, which was also fully supported by the diamond business, and now the garment industry has also joined this protest
 ek anumaan ke mutabik gujarat main kareeb 11,000 garment manuphaccharer hai or kareeb 4 lakh log is vyavsaay se jude hue hai
 Gujarat Garments Manufacturers Association says that by the time a cloth is made, it comes through about 13 to 14 different places
 banane se lekar rang auki alag-alag hisson kii kataai or phir silaai jaise kaamon main alag-alag karigar isse jude hue hote hai or ye vyavsaay puri tarah se asangathit he
 In such a situation, the excise duty applicable at all these levels will be about 8 to 10 percent on a product
 pehle hi ye udyog thodi mandi jhel rahaa he auki agar mahangaai or bad jaaegi to isaki dikkatein or zyada bad jaaengi
 The head of the Gujarat Garments Manufacturers Association, Vijay Purohit, says that with the addition of one more department, corruption will increase immensely
 jab jab inspector raaj aayaa he bhrashtachar or badha hi he
 Arpan Shah, the secretary of the association, says that if anyone really makes Modi ji's formula Make in India meaningful, it is the textile industry
 aise main agar kapadaa udyog behaal hua to sarkari sapane bhi puure nahin ho paaenge
 According to an estimate, after agriculture, the textile industry is the highest in the country, employing about 11 crore people
 tippaniyan It is important that jewelers have been opposing the 1 percent extra excise duty on gold and silver jewelery continuously for the last 12 days and are on an indefinite strike across the country to oppose it
 isse ab tak is vyapaar ko kareeb 72,000 karod rupee kaa nuksaan ho chukaa he
 It is important that the opposition of Narendra Modi government's budget is being most vocally in his home state of Gujarat
 pehle johariyon kii hadtaal, jise heere ke vyavsaay ne bhi sampurna samarthan diya auki ab garment udyog bhi is virodh main jud gaya he
 First of all, this industry is facing a slowdown and if inflation increases further, its problems will increase further

 notebandi kii ghoshnaa ke 50 din puure hone or shanivaar ko raashtra ke naam pradhanmantri ke sambodhan se pehle congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne narendra modi se paanch sawaal puche hai
 Rahul questioned how much black money has been seized after announcing the denomination of big notes on November 8 and how many jobs have been lost due to this decision
 congress upaadhyaksh ne pradhanmantri se poocha ki unhone yah faisla karne se pehle kin logon se vichaar vimarsh kiya or aashcharya vyakt kiya ki visheshgyon, arthshaastriyon or arabiai se kyon vichaar vimarsh nahin kiya gaya
 The Congress vice president wanted to know how many people deposited more than Rs 25 lakh in the accounts in the six months before the announcement of the November 8 demonetisation
 rahul gandhi ne kaha, ‘notebandi kii ghoshnaa ke 50 din puure ho gaye hai, desh in paanch sawaalon par aapke jawaab kaa intjaar kar rahaa he, modiji
 How much black money was seized after Rahul's PM Modi's question 1-8 November 2016? 2- How much economic loss and loss of jobs did the country suffer due to this decision? 3-how many people died due to demonetisation? Did these people get compensation? 4-who did the Prime Minister consult with regarding demonetisation? Which people who deposited more than Rs 25 lakh in bank accounts in the six months before the decision of demonetisation on 5-8 November 2016? Accumulated? Rahul Gandhi, who has been a strong opposition to demonetisation, has already described this decision as the biggest economic experiment to be done in the history of the world
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne aam chunaav se pehle ek masterstroke chal diya he
 Rahul said on Monday that NYAY (minimum Income Scheme), a major scheme that guarantees minimum income to 20 per cent of the country, will be implemented if Congress comes to power
 iske tahat kareeb 25 karod logon ko har saal 72,000 rupee kii neutanat aay kii guarantee di jaaegi
 72,000 rupees annually means that at least six thousand rupees will be given every month
 is yojana ko congress kii ab tak kii sabase mahatvakankshi yojana manaregaa se bhi behatar aay guarantee kaa saadhan mana ja rahaa he
 Significantly, many Congress schemes targeting farmers and poor have been successful even before
 isamen ab tak kii sabase mahatvakankshi yojana mahatma gandhi rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee act (MNREGA) he
 Apart from this, the debt waiver scheme of the Congress has also been considered successful in many states
 agar nunatam aay guarantee yojana kii manaregaa se tulana karen to NYAY ke tahat milane vaale 72,000 rupee salanaa nunatam mazdooree par 172 se 338 din ke rojgaar ke baraabar (rajyon ke mutabik) hai
 Not only this, even if we talk about high level skilled workers, it is equal to 132 to 254 days of employment at the minimum wage
 is tarah NYAY vastav main manaregaa se behatar aay guarantee kii yojana sabit ho sakati he
 Unlike MNREGA, there is no compulsion to do any kind of work and every poor will get this amount
 manaregaa main mahaj 100 din kii rojgaar guarantee di jaati he
 However, it also provides an average of 40 to 45 days of employment annually
 modi sarkaar kii kul sabsidi 3 lakh karod kicongress kii is mahatvakankshi yojana par salanaa 3
 It is estimated to cost Rs 6 lakh crore, while the total subsidy of the Modi government is only about Rs 3 lakh crore
 saal 2019-20 ke bajet main food, fertilizer or petroleum par kul sabsidi kareeb 3 lakh karod rupee kii he
 Apart from this, the plan expenditure on education has been fixed at Rs 94,000 crore
 piem kisaan cash transfar skim ke liye 75,000 karod rupee kaa bajet tay kiya gaya he
 The health budget of the central government is about Rs 61,000 crore
 rahul gandhi ne bataaya ki desh se garibi dur karne ko lakshya rakhkar laai gai is yojana ke tahat har saal desh ke 20 fisadi logon ko maheene main kam se kam 12 hajaar rupee aay milanaa sunishchit kiya jayega
 He said that Narendra Modi can give money to the rich people of the country, so why can't the Congress party give 72,000 rupees to the poorest of the poor
 rahul gandhi ne somvaar ko kaha ki yah yojana taiyaar he or yah vittiya rup se puri tarah se vyaavhaarik he
 Under this, five crore families or 25 crore people will get the benefit of this scheme
 is idia ko jabardast bataate hue rahul gandhi ne kaha ki jo log 12 hajaar rupee se kam kamaate hai, ham sunishchit karenge ki unki aay 12 hajaar rupee maheene tak pahunche
 He said that this scheme will be implemented in several stages if the Congress government comes to power
 
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi continues to surprise the world with his different style
 aane vaale 12 agast ko bhi kuch aisa hi hone vaala he, jab piem modi discovery ke program ‘man vs Wild’ main aaenge or uttarakhand ke jagalon kaa safar karenge
 This program is going to be quite grand as it will be broadcast on 12 channels in 5 languages in 180 countries of the world
 is kaarykram main naa sirf paryaavaran, jaanavar sangrakshan se judi baton ko jaanane kaa avasar milegaa balki pradhanmantri modi ke raaj kaa bhi pataa chalegaa, jab unhone kuch saal jangalon main bitaye the
 a statement issued by Discovery has given complete information about this program
 discovery ne apane bayaan main kaha ki duniya ke sabase bade loktantr ke urjavan pradhanmantri narendra modi or apane adventure ke liye mashhoor bear grills ek saath uttarakhand ke jangalon main adventure karte najar aaenge
 The event is shot in Jim Corbett National Park
 kaarykram ke bare main pradhanmantri kya bole
 
 
 Speaking to Discovery, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said about this program that for many years i have been in the shade of nature amidst the forests, which has had a profound impact on my life
 isliye jab mere se aise kaarykram ke bare main poocha gaya to main khud ko roak nahin paaya
 Through this program, there will be an opportunity to put India's natural power in front of the world
 jangal main ek baar phir itnaa samay bitaakar acha laga
 The anchor of the show, Bear Grylls, also dated Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that it is a matter of great pride for him that he is working with one of the world's big leaders
 aapako bataa den ki is kaarykram kaa prasaaran 12 agast ko raat nau baje kiya jayega
 The program will be broadcast in Hindi, English, Bengali, Tamil and Telugu
