 vahaan se kareeb 40 kimi aage state hive hote hue kondasavali gaanv ke kondapara basti main pahunchate hi jesibi mashine kaam main lagi dikhti hai
 No road ahead, only jungle
 us jangal ko chirakar sadaken banaai ja rahi hai
 CRPF armed personnel are monitoring around the construction site
 yah sadak sukama jile ke us jagargunda jaakar niklegi jo do dashak pehle tak imali ke vyapaar kaa bahuraji hub tha
 With the construction of this road, the Naxalite affected Sukma, Dantewada and Bijapur will be connected not only among themselves, but also with the neighboring states
 isi tarah kii sadak indravati nadi par 26 pillar ke jariye bijapur se jagargunda aa rahi he
 It is such a struggle to reach the naxal-affected areas in the shadow of the bayou, in which an IED blast occurred at two o'clock in the day on July 27 and a soldier was seriously injured

 More than 70 ieds have been found in the last five months in a stretch of up to 5 km
 haalanki abhi kareeb 9 kimi jangal saaf kar sadak banaai jaani he
 Actually, the administration's strategy is to increase penetration in Naxal-controlled areas and push the Naxalites on the backfoot
 lekin suraksha balon or naksaliyon ke bich adivasee pis rahe hai
 For example, since the road construction work started, the residents of Kondapara in Kondasavali have escaped

 The script of generational change In the words of an officer posted in Bastar division, "it was like an island before
" " bastar jahaan pehle ekmaatr jila tha, ab use saat jilon main baant diya gaya taaki vikaas ko raftaar mil sake
 While 78 CRPF personnel were martyred in the Naxalite attack on 6 April 2010 in Dantewada, the death of 27 people shook the entire nation in an attack on a convoy of Congress leaders in Sukma's Jhiram Valley on 25 May 2013
 tab ek tabake se purajor aawaaj uthi ki naksaliyon ke khilaaf aarpaar kii jang ched deni chahie
 But violence is not the solution to the problem
 isliye rajya sarkaar apni ranneeti ke tahat vikaas ke kaam ko sangeenon ke saae main hi sahi, anjaam dene main jute gai
 Actually, in this change, the government is using education and employment as an important tool
 ab usee dantewada ke gidam main 125 acre main failaa ajukeshan city badlaav kii kahani bayaan kar rahaa he
 Despite the summer vacation at Aastha School in this education city, some such children could not go home because the Naxalites had destroyed their family

 However, after talking to other hoteliers and experts, it was found that the reason behind denying the room to Pakistani family is fear of the police and nothing else
 tippaniyan Farid Sheikh of Aman Committee said that the police should relax the rules
 tabhi ye samasya khatm hogi
 The police is silent on the whole matter
 uskaa kahana he ki bina kisi shikaayat ke ham kuch nahin kar sakate hai

 koi sarkaar garib bacchon ko piessi, upiessi ke liye koching karaae wo bhi muft main yakeenan ye acchhee baat he lekin kya bazaar main us koching kii fees se zyada paisa sarkaar bhar sakati he, agar bharti he to kyon kya jo bachche fees dekar padhate hai unki gunvattta free main padhane waalon se karaab he ki koching santhaan unase kam paisa letaa he yaa phir aisa karnaa bhrashtrachaar ke daayre main hai
 In Chhattisgarh, the government has provided free coaching to poor children to prepare for the Public Service Commission examinations
 mukhyamantri raman singh ke nirvachan kshetra rajanandgaanv se yojana shuru hui, ilaaka mukhyamantri kaa he so do saal pehle prashasan ne tatparta dikhaai
 Tenders were called from private coaching centers
 udaan naam kii sanstha ko 100 bacchon kii koching kaa zimmaa mila koching ke liye 67,000 rou
 The government approved the amount of Rs
 haalanki santhaan kaa kahana he usne nirdhaarit se kam fees lee he
 The owner of the flight, Ankit Agarwal, said that there is a one-year package, pre-main, complete interview preparation is done, 78,000 fees are inclusive and GST is 90,000
 hamane normal fees se kam rate kot kiya he, puri prakriya hone ke baad hamen tender mila he puri fees 90,000 hoti he hamane 67000 kot kiya he
 But the question is how did the government give out pre and main money out of the government coffers
 kyonki bagair pre paas kiye, mens kii fees bharne kaa matlab nahin he or bagaiyr donon ke saakshaatkaar hota nahin
 In this case, when we spoke to Tarkeshwar Dewangan, Deputy Commissioner of Tribal Welfare Department, he also gave a roundly reply, "pre, main interview is for everyone, this is the plan, the children who are preparing for pre-given mains
 haalanki bachche kehete hai mens ke liye wo lagbhag 25,000 bharte hai, pre ke liye 14500 yani kul 39,500 ru
 Other institutions are saying, information was not given in the main newspapers and the amount that is being collected is also high
 jhuulekar insticute ke maalik lekh ram jhuulekar kaa kahana he 67000 ru
 It is being given per child, in 20,000-25000 books we provide coaching with other material
 sarkaar kah rahi he usne excilence ke aage jeb nahin dekhi
 Education Minister Kedar Kashyap said there were tenders, different institutions participated
 jitani acchhee sansthaaon kaa chayan karenge utani acchhee shiksha milegi
 The contract was received through the presentation given
 bhrashtachar kaa koi vishay nahin he jisane bhaag liya prastut kiya jo behatar laga use padhaane kaa jimmaa mila
 At the same time, Congress is making allegations of serious irregularities in this whole matter
 congress ke varisht netaa pi el puniya ne kaha garvenence ko chhodkar ye sarkaar sab karti he
 Government is paying more money than private coaching
 ye mahaj naatak he, janata ko chalaa he privet main jo fees he usase zyada sarkaar de rahi he
 Presently coaching is being given for PSC and UPAAC in 5 such centers in the state
 har centre main lagbhag 100 bacchon kii fees sarkari tijori se bhari ja rahi he
 According to the NITI Aayog, Chhattisgarh is one of the states to take back the country
 rashtriya str par 20-24 saal ke jo noujvaan ucch shiksha hasil karte hai, unki taadaad chhattisgarh main lagbhag 7 fisad kam he aise main sarkaar kii pahal to acchhee he lekin usamen bhrashtachar ke aarope uski gambhirtha par gambhir sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 The organization named Udaan got the responsibility of coaching 100 children for coaching Rs
 67,000
 kii raashi sarkaar ne sweekrut kii
 However, the institute says it has charged less than the prescribed fee
 udaan ke maalik ankit agarwal ne bataaya ek saal kaa package he, pre-mukhya, saakshaatkaar kii puri taiyaari hoti he, 78,000 fees he jiesti milakar 90,000 hoti he
 We have quoted a lower rate than the normal fee, after the whole process we have received a tender, the entire fee is 90,000, we have quote 67000
 lekin sawaal ye he ki sarkaar ne sarkari tijori se ekamusth pre or mens ke paise kaise diye
 Because without passing the pre, it is not necessary to pay the fees of the mains and there is no interview without both
 is maamle main jab aadim jati kalyaan vibhaag ke upayukta tarakeshwar devangan se hamane baat kii to unhone bhi golmol jawaab dete hue kaha pre, mens intervyuu sabake liye he ye yojana he, jin bacchon ne pre diya wo mens kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Although children say that they fill around 25,000 for mains, 14500 for pre, ie a total of Rs 39,500
 duusare santhaan kah rahe hai, mukhya akhabaaron main soochna nahin di gai or jo raashi vasuuli ja rahi he wo bhi zyada he
 Jhulekar Institute owner Lekha Ram Jhulekar says Rs 67000
 prati bachche diya ja rahaa he, ham to 20,000-25000 main kitabon duusare material ke saath koching karavaate hai
 The government is saying that it did not see pockets in front of the excellence
 shiksha mantri kedaar kashyap ne kaha tender hue the, alag alag sansthaaon ne bhaag liya tha
 The better the institutions you choose, the better education you will get
 jo pregentation diya uske madhyam se theka mila
 There is no subject of corruption who participated, who thought it was better he got the responsibility to teach
 vahiin congress is puure maamle main gambhir aniyamitata ke aarope laga rahi he
 Senior Congress leader PL Punia said that this government does everything except governance
 privet koching se zyada paisa sarkaar de rahi he
 This is just drama, the public is deceived, the government is paying more than the fees in private
 philhal rajya main aise 5 centaron main piessi or upieesi ke liye koching di ja rahi he
 The fees of about 100 children in each center are being filled by the government coffers
 niti ayog ke mutabik desh ko peeche le jane vaale rajyon main chhattisgarh bhi shumaar he
 At the national level, the number of young people of 20-24 years who get higher education is less than 7 percent in Chhattisgarh, the government's initiative is good, but the corruption charges are raising serious questions about its seriousness

 18 march se may aa gaya, lekin uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan lagane kii tamaam daleelon se bijepi peeche nahin hati
 The membership of the nine mlas, on whose own strength he argued that the government has come in a minority, went away
 court main 9 vidhayak apane aapako sabit nahin kar paae
 The BJP, which has been opposing the misuse of President's rule in the Congress era, got stuck this time
 modi sarkaar ne jitani bhi daleelein or dhaaraon kaa sahaara liya, court main kuch nahin tikaa
 From the High Court to the Supreme Court, BJP continued to lose in this case
 sadan main jab vishwasamat hua usamen bhi haar gai
 The trust vote was conducted by the Supreme Court under his supervision, even when claims were made about the outcome of the envelope not being opened within the court, but he had no recognition
 lipapha khulte hi dehradun main congress kheme main utsaah bad gaya
 33 votes in favor of Harish Rawat and 28 in favor of BJP
 harish ravat ko phir se shapath lene kii zarurat nahin he
 As soon as the court order came, a meeting of the Union Cabinet took place and it was decided to remove President's rule
 bijepi ne sanvaidhaniktaa, naitikta or bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke dam par raashtrapati shashan ko har str par jaays tehraane kaa prayaas kiya lekin sahyogi sanghavaad kaa naaraa dene vaali bijepi adaalat main apni baat sabit nahin kar pai
 For more than a month, the dismissal of an elected government was also wasted through public debates at many levels
 do-do baar sting oparation kaa maamla saamne aayaa, jisamen ravat par paise se sarkaar bachaane ke prayaas kaa aarope bhi laga
 The questions raised by the sting operation and the questions about imposing President's rule, both had no relation
 lekin bijepi sting oparation ke zariye raashtrapati shashan kaa bachaav karne kaa harsambhav prayaas karti rahi
 When the famous lawyer Harish Salve referred to the sting operation, the Uttarakhand High Court said that if the President starts imposing his rule in the states on the basis of allegations of corruption then no state government will be able to run more than five minutes
 baharhaal sting oparation ke maamle kii sibiai jaanch bhi karne lagi he
 Everything happened quickly but after turning around he reached Rawat's door
 ve ab phir se mukhyamantri hai
 Then he belonged to the Congress, now he has to thank Mayawati
 mayawati kah rahi hai ki yah faisla sirf uttarakhand tak simit he
 She will not go with the Congress in Uttar Pradesh
 raashtrapati shashan lagane ke baad vitt mantri arun jetali ne ek blog likhaa tha
 One of the first lines of which was that the decision to impose President's rule was taken by the President on the basis of his political prudence and all his documents kept
 yahi daleel centre sarkaar ke vakil ne hoicourt main di
 The High Court said that log galat faisale le sakate hai, chaahe wo raashtrapati hon yaa jaj
 
 
 This is not the decision of a king, who cannot have a judicial review
 centre sarkaar ne raashtrapati kii manzuri ke naam par apane faisle kaa khub bachaav kiya, jabaki prastaav to kendriya mantrimandal se paas hota he
 President Pranab Mukherjee could once send for consideration
 jo unhone nahin bheja
 Not even questioned once
 agar mantrimandal se dobaaraa prastaav aata to unhen haa karnaa hi hota
 The question arises as to why he did not send it for a second thought
 phir bhi centre sarkaar adaalat or adaalat ke baahar channelon main yah daleel detii rahi ki raashtrapati ne dastauez dekh liye hai
 The decision of the Uttarakhand High Court in this case is historic in that it demolished the central logic of the Central Government, on which the President's rule was being defended
 'ye koi raja kaa faisla nahin he, jisaki nyaayik samiksha nahin ho sakati
 'this line will echo in the political history of Indian democracy in times to come
 jab bhi koi raashtrapati raashtrapati shashan lagane ke prastaav par dastakhat karenge ek baar ise yaad karenge
 His advisors will remind
 aap raja nahin hai
 The decision you are taking may be reviewed in court
 vipaksh ke netaa or samvidhan ke jaankaar sab raashtrapati par bhi sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 The President cannot defend himself by coming in public, but the public will question him
 raashtrapati hi nahin rajyapal kii bhoomika kii bhi samiksha honi chahie
 The Uttarakhand High Court also said about the Governor that he is fair
 centre kaa agent nahin hota
 You are a constitutional expert and senior advocate of the Supreme Court, Raju Ramachandran
 aap kai maamalon main supreme court ke salaahkaar bhi rahe hai
 Raju Ramachandran says that he is disappointed with the role of the President in this whole matter
 raashtrapati ko apni vivekadhin shaktiyon kaa istemaal karnaa chahie tha
 Their role in this case may be limited
 arunachal pradesh main raashtrapati shashan ke maamle main unhone sawaal puche the, lekin uttarakhand ke maamle main unhone koi sawaal nahin uthaae jabaki floor test hone vaala tha
 You are Soli Sorabjee, the Attorney General in the Vajpayee government
 jane maane samvidhanvid psorabji ne kaha ki uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan lagane ke maamle main modi sarkaar ko jaldbaazi nahin kerani chahie thi
 This sent the message that the Central Government does not want to allow the floor test to take place
 psorabji ramchandran kii tarah sakht nahin hai, magar kaha ki koi kah saktaa he ki raashtrapati ko sarkaar ke paas file waapas bhej deni chahie thi, lekin kya hota agar sarkaar file waapas bhej detii
 The President had to sign
 
 
 raashtrapati ne kuch bhi galat nahin kiya
 
 
 The courts are now active, so the government should have acted with caution
 1994 main supreme court kii 9 jajon kii bench ne es aar bommai cese main faisla diya ki ativishisht paristhiti main hi raashtrapati shashan lagane ke liye anuchhed 356 kaa istemaal hona chahie
 Should never be for the political interest of the central government
 uttarakhand hoicourt ne maheene bhar se kam samay main sunwaayee kar faisla diya
 There is history in itself
 wo bhi puraani sarkaar ke rahete faisla diya he
 It is not that another government was formed or another government came through elections and then the decision came
 isliye uttarakhand hoicourt kaa faisla or baad main supreme court kaa faisla ab padhaayaa bhi jayega
 But thanks to this, former Karnataka Chief Minister SR Bommai who fought a court battle for the dismissal of his government
 ye or baat he ki unhen is ladaai kaa laabh nahin mila
 When the decision of the Supreme Court came, his government was gone
 tab centre main congress kii sarkaar ne bommai kii sarkaar barkhaast kii thi
 Today the Congress has benefited from that battle of Bommai
 harish ravat kii sarkaar batch gai he
 But Harish Rawat also added to this fight
 kya vidambnaa he
 In the matter of President's rule, the Congress does not stand morally in any debate but it has gained the moral strength for such debates on the pretext of Uttarakhand
 harish ravat bhi is maamle main sanvaidhanik itihaas kaa hissaa ban gaye
 Rahul Gandhi said that he was doing wrong
 ham sahi kar rahe the
 Democracy has won
 is saal 26 janvari ke din arunachal pradesh main raashtrapati shashan lagaaya gaya
 The Congress also challenged this, but the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court continued to be heard and a new government was formed in Arunachal Pradesh
 supreme court kaa antim faisla abhi tak nahin aayaa he
 We did a lot of searching in Google about the statement of the Law Minister of the country, Sadanand Gowda about President's rule
 ho saktaa he mujhe na mila ho isliye daawey se nahin kah rahaa magar kanoon mantri ko chhod baaki tamaam netaaon ke bayaan zarur mili
 Isn't it strange that such a big constitutional debate took place and there is not even a tweet by the Law Minister
 kya ye maamla raajnneetik hi tha
 Sadanand Gowda has tweeted on the Soil Health Card and Beti Bachao Beti Padhao after the Supreme Court's verdict came on Wednesday
 vitt mantri arun jetali kaa blog mila
 Which he wrote in Hindi and English
 uttarakhand hoicourt ke chif justise ke em joseph or justise ve ke visht ne sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha tha ki uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan ke maamle main centre sarkaar ko nishpaksh hona chahie lekin wo privet party jaisaa vyavhaar kar rahi he
 We are hurt that the Central Government is behaving like this
 aap court ke saath aisa khel khilne kii kaise soch sakate hai
 Chief Justice KM Joseph has now been transferred
 lekin unki bench ne raashtrapati shashan ke maamne main ek paimaana tay kar diya he
 The Supreme Court's decision has also been in the same direction
 is faisle ne kai tarah ke aaropon or party ke bheetar apane virodhiyon se ghire harish ravat ko nayaa jeevandaan diya he
 The comments harish ravat ke liye ye ek aisi siyaasi ladaai sabit hui jisamen unhone ek hi waar main modi sarkaar kii koshishon or party main apane siyaasi virodhiyon ko chit kar diya
 Former MLA Vijay Bahuguna and former minister Harak Singh Rawat were accompanied by nine mlas neither here nor there
 congress ke in baagiyon ke aadhaar par hi bijepi ne rajya main harish ravat sarkaar ko patkhni dene kii yojana banaai thi
 The rebels signed the bjp's letter pad in a letter to the Governor to sack the Harish Rawat government
 wo bijepi ke netaaon ke saath vimaan se dehradun se dilli pahunche or bijepi ke netaaon ke saath bason main kabhi gudgaanv to kabhi jaipur main ghoomte rahe
 Stayed at Five Star Hotels
 dilli main harish ravat ke kilaaf sting jari kar un par bhrashtachar kaa aarope bhi lagaaya, lekin kuch kaam nahin aayaa
 The assembly had to face defeat and also in the Uttarakhand High Court
 uttarakhand hycourt ne in baagiyon kii yachika khaarij kar unki vidhayaki radd karne ke spikar ke faisale par muhar laga di
 The High Court said that those legislators have done their own work to relinquish their membership from the political party
 ab in baagiyon ke saamne vikalp bahut hi kam bache hai
 Many have lost their political careers
 naa congress main vaapasi karte banataa he, naa bijepi main shaamil hote
 After the victory of Harish Rawat, he has no special significance for the BJP either
 1993 main pakistan main nawaz shareef ko vahaan kii supreme court ne phir se behaal kar diya tha
 Which was dismissed by President Ghulam Isaac Khan
 donon mulkon main wo pehali sarkaar thi jo raashtrapati ke dwaara barkhaastagi ke baad behaal hui thi
 After the decision, a minister of Nawaz Sharif said that neither God nor Visam was found, neither lived nor lived here
 18 march se 11 may aa gaya
 Uttarakhand reached from where it had gone
 is uttarakhand ke kaaran itnaa samay gaya ki samaajawaadee party kii saansad jaya bachchan ek din rajya sabha main jhunjhala gayi
 He said that due to Uttarakhand, many important issues are not being discussed
 harish ravat ko phir se shapath lene kii zarurat nahin he
 As soon as the court order came, a meeting of the Union Cabinet took place and it was decided to remove President's rule
 bijepi ne sanvaidhaniktaa, naitikta or bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke dam par raashtrapati shashan ko har str par jaays tehraane kaa prayaas kiya lekin sahyogi sanghavaad kaa naaraa dene vaali bijepi adaalat main apni baat sabit nahin kar pai

 Then he belonged to the Congress, now he has to thank Mayawati
 mayawati kah rahi hai ki yah faisla sirf uttarakhand tak simit he
 She will not go with the Congress in Uttar Pradesh
 raashtrapati shashan lagane ke baad vitt mantri arun jetali ne ek blog likhaa tha
 One of the first lines of which was that the decision to impose President's rule was taken by the President on the basis of his political prudence and all his documents kept
 yahi daleel centre sarkaar ke vakil ne hoicourt main di
 The High Court said that log galat faisale le sakate hai, chaahe wo raashtrapati hon yaa jaj
 
 
 This is not the decision of a king, who cannot have a judicial review
 centre sarkaar ne raashtrapati kii manzuri ke naam par apane faisle kaa khub bachaav kiya, jabaki prastaav to kendriya mantrimandal se paas hota he
 President Pranab Mukherjee could once send for consideration
 jo unhone nahin bheja
 Not even questioned once
 agar mantrimandal se dobaaraa prastaav aata to unhen haa karnaa hi hota
 The question arises as to why he did not send it for a second thought
 phir bhi centre sarkaar adaalat or adaalat ke baahar channelon main yah daleel detii rahi ki raashtrapati ne dastauez dekh liye hai
 The decision of the Uttarakhand High Court in this case is historic in that it demolished the central logic of the Central Government, on which the President's rule was being defended
 'ye koi raja kaa faisla nahin he, jisaki nyaayik samiksha nahin ho sakati
 'this line will echo in the political history of Indian democracy in times to come
 jab bhi koi raashtrapati raashtrapati shashan lagane ke prastaav par dastakhat karenge ek baar ise yaad karenge
 His advisors will remind
 aap raja nahin hai
 The decision you are taking may be reviewed in court
 vipaksh ke netaa or samvidhan ke jaankaar sab raashtrapati par bhi sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 The President cannot defend himself by coming in public, but the public will question him
 raashtrapati hi nahin rajyapal kii bhoomika kii bhi samiksha honi chahie
 The Uttarakhand High Court also said about the Governor that he is fair
 centre kaa agent nahin hota
 You are a constitutional expert and senior advocate of the Supreme Court, Raju Ramachandran
 aap kai maamalon main supreme court ke salaahkaar bhi rahe hai
 Raju Ramachandran says that he is disappointed with the role of the President in this whole matter
 raashtrapati ko apni vivekadhin shaktiyon kaa istemaal karnaa chahie tha
 Their role in this case may be limited
 arunachal pradesh main raashtrapati shashan ke maamle main unhone sawaal puche the, lekin uttarakhand ke maamle main unhone koi sawaal nahin uthaae jabaki floor test hone vaala tha
 You are Soli Sorabjee, the Attorney General in the Vajpayee government
 jane maane samvidhanvid psorabji ne kaha ki uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan lagane ke maamle main modi sarkaar ko jaldbaazi nahin kerani chahie thi
 This sent the message that the Central Government does not want to allow the floor test to take place
 psorabji ramchandran kii tarah sakht nahin hai, magar kaha ki koi kah saktaa he ki raashtrapati ko sarkaar ke paas file waapas bhej deni chahie thi, lekin kya hota agar sarkaar file waapas bhej detii
 The President had to sign
 
 
 raashtrapati ne kuch bhi galat nahin kiya
 
 
 The courts are now active, so the government should have acted with caution
 1994 main supreme court kii 9 jajon kii bench ne es aar bommai cese main faisla diya ki ativishisht paristhiti main hi raashtrapati shashan lagane ke liye anuchhed 356 kaa istemaal hona chahie
 Should never be for the political interest of the central government
 uttarakhand hoicourt ne maheene bhar se kam samay main sunwaayee kar faisla diya
 There is history in itself
 wo bhi puraani sarkaar ke rahete faisla diya he
 It is not that another government was formed or another government came through elections and then the decision came
 isliye uttarakhand hoicourt kaa faisla or baad main supreme court kaa faisla ab padhaayaa bhi jayega
 But thanks to this, former Karnataka Chief Minister SR Bommai who fought a court battle for the dismissal of his government
 ye or baat he ki unhen is ladaai kaa laabh nahin mila
 When the decision of the Supreme Court came, his government was gone
 tab centre main congress kii sarkaar ne bommai kii sarkaar barkhaast kii thi
 Today the Congress has benefited from that battle of Bommai
 harish ravat kii sarkaar batch gai he
 But Harish Rawat also added to this fight

 In the matter of President's rule, the Congress does not stand morally in any debate but it has gained the moral strength for such debates on the pretext of Uttarakhand

 Rahul Gandhi said that he was doing wrong

 The Congress also challenged this, but the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court continued to be heard and a new government was formed in Arunachal Pradesh

 He said that due to Uttarakhand, many important issues are not being discussed
 aap samvidhan ke jaankaar or supreme court ke senior edwocket raju ramchandran hai
 He has also been an advisor to the Supreme Court in many cases
 raju ramchandran kaa kahana he ki is puure maamle main raashtrapati kii bhoomika se niraash hai
 The President should have exercised his discretionary powers
 is maamle main unki bhoomika bhale hi simit ho
 He had asked questions in the case of President's rule in Arunachal Pradesh, but in Uttarakhand, he did not raise any questions while the floor test was about to take place
 aap vaajapeyi sarkaar main atorni general rahe soli psorabji hai
 Eminent constitutionalist Sorabji said that the Modi government should not have been hasty in the matter of imposing President's rule in Uttarakhand
 isse ye sandesh gaya ki centre sarkaar flor test nahin hone dena chaahati
 Sorabji is not as strict as Ramachandran, but said that one could say that the President should have sent the file back to the government, but what if the government had sent the file back
 raashtrapati ko dastakhat karne padate
 
 
 The President did nothing wrong
 
 
 court ab active hai isliye sarkaar ko saavdhaanee se kaam karnaa chahie tha
 In 1994, a 9-judge bench of the Supreme Court ruled in the SR Bommai case that Article 356 should be used to impose President's rule only in very specific circumstances
 centre sarkaar ke raajnneetik hit ke liye kabhi nahin hona chahie
 The Uttarakhand High Court gave its verdict in less than a month
 apane aap main itihaas he
 They have given the decision even during the old government
 aisa nahin ki duusari sarkaar ban gai yaa chunaav hokar koi or sarkaar aa gai phir faisla aayaa
 Therefore, the decision of Uttarakhand High Court and later the decision of the Supreme Court will now be taught
 par iske liye karnataka ke purv mukhyamantri es aar bommai kaa shukraguzaar hona chahie jo apni sarkaar kii barkhaastagi ke liye adalati ladaai lade
 It is another matter that he did not get the benefit of this fight
 jab supreme court kaa faisla aayaa tab unki sarkaar ja chuki thi
 Then Bommai's government was sacked by the Congress government at the Center
 aaj congress ko bommai kii us ladaai se laabh hua he
 Harish Rawat's government has survived
 magar is ladaai main harish ravat ne bhi jod diya
 What an irony raashtrapati shashan ke maamle main congress naitik rup se kisi bahes main tik nahin paati he lekin usne uttarakhand ke bahaane aisi bahason ke liye naitik bal hasil kar liya he
 Harish Rawat also became part of constitutional history in this case
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki wo galat kar rahe the
 We were doing it right
 loktantr kii jeet hui he
 President's rule was imposed in Arunachal Pradesh on 26 January this year
 congress ne ise bhi chunauti di magar supreme court kii samvidhan peeth main sunwaayee chalati rahi or arunachal pradesh main nai sarkaar ban gai
 The final decision of the Supreme Court has not yet come
 hamane raashtrapati shashan ke bare main desh ke kanoon mantri sadanand gauda ke bayaan ko google main khub search kiya
 i may not have received it, so i am not saying the claim, but except the Law Minister, the statements of all the leaders must be received
 kya ye ajeeb nahin he ki itani badi sanvaidhanik bahes ho gai or kanoon mantri kaa ek twit tak nahin he
 Was this case political? sadanand gauda ne buudhvaar ko supreme court kaa faisla aane ke baad soyal health card or beti bachaao beti padhaao par twit kiya he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's blog found
 jise unhone hindi or angreji main likhaa tha
 Uttarakhand High Court Chief Justice KM Joseph and Justice VK Bisht had said during the hearing that the central government should be fair in the matter of President's rule in Uttarakhand but it is behaving like a private party
 ham aahat hai ki centre sarkaar aisa vyavhaar kar rahi he
 How can you think of playing such a game with the court
 chif justise ke em joseph kaa ab tabadalaa ho chukaa he
 But his bench has set a scale in terms of President's rule

 In 1994, a 9-judge bench of the Supreme Court ruled in the SR Bommai case that Article 356 should be used to impose President's rule only in very specific circumstances

 The Uttarakhand High Court gave its verdict in less than a month
 apane aap main itihaas he
 They have given the decision even during the old government
 aisa nahin ki duusari sarkaar ban gai yaa chunaav hokar koi or sarkaar aa gai phir faisla aayaa
 Therefore, the decision of Uttarakhand High Court and later the decision of the Supreme Court will now be taught
 par iske liye karnataka ke purv mukhyamantri es aar bommai kaa shukraguzaar hona chahie jo apni sarkaar kii barkhaastagi ke liye adalati ladaai lade
 It is another matter that he did not get the benefit of this fight
 jab supreme court kaa faisla aayaa tab unki sarkaar ja chuki thi
 Then Bommai's government was sacked by the Congress government at the Center
 aaj congress ko bommai kii us ladaai se laabh hua he
 Harish Rawat's government has survived

 What an irony raashtrapati shashan ke maamle main congress naitik rup se kisi bahes main tik nahin paati he lekin usne uttarakhand ke bahaane aisi bahason ke liye naitik bal hasil kar liya he
 Harish Rawat also became part of constitutional history in this case

 com / aeetayjodn They were married last May in view of the love of a tiger and white tigress at Delhi Zoo
 ab is jode ne dilli ju ko khushkhabari di he
 The white tigress is 'nirbhaya' pregnant and Xu's employees are very happy with this news
 yah badi khushkhabari is lihaaj se he ki pichley 27 saal main pehali baar yahaan prajnan se koi baagh kaa baccha paidaa hoga
 According to the Indian Express, the white tigress was named 'nirbhaya' by Ju's director Renu Singh in April
 yah baghin aksar ek safed baagh ke saath hi rahati thi, jise 'karan' naam diya gaya he
 Karan is a yellow striped tiger
 in donon ke paraspar pyaar ko dekhte hue juprashasan nedonon ko ek hi ghere main rakhaa or may maheene main inaki shaadi kii rasm puri kii gai
 Now 'nirbhaya' has two months' pregnancy and is expected to deliver in mid-august
 ek gord ne bataaya, 'use andar ke ek privet ilaake main rakhaa gaya he, kyonki baahar rakhane par use kisi tarah kaa nuksaan hone kaa dar he
 However, he still has enough room to move around and we are constantly watching him
 ab sab bhagwaan bharose he
 'nirbhaya' dose has been changed in view of pregnancy
 pehle kii tarah use rojaanaa 12 kilo meet to miltaa hi he, ab use roj 3 kilo chikan, ek anda or ek litre doodh bhi diya ja rahaa he
 Two weeks before his pregnancy, Gord will also begin surveillance at night
 baccha paidaa hone ke baad jab vah ek maheene kaa ho hoga yaa hogi, tabhi use janata ko dekhne ke liye baahar nikaala jayega
 Even before that in 1991, the Xu administration made a yellow Bengal tiger 'beautiful' close to a white tigress 'shanti'
 in donon ke do bachche hue the
 Among them, one was yellow and one white
 madhya pradesh ke gwalior sthit raksha anusandhan evam vikaas sthapana (diardii) ke vaigyanikon ne maanav mel ko pani main badalane kii aisi takneekee viksit kii he jisase desh kii surat badal sakati he
 After Railways, it is now going to be the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India
 gaanvon main shauchalay kii kami ko dur karne ke liye chalaae ja rahe nirmal bharat abhiyaan main isaki madad lee jaaegi
 On August 25, Union Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh visited DRDE for the first time to see this technology
 unhone ummid jataai he ki agle 10 varshon main is takanic se bane jaev shauchalay gaanvon kii tasviir badal kar rakh denge
 Toilets of this technique are bio-digested
 diardii ke vaigyanikon ne research ke dauraan yah paaya ki prakruti main aise bacteria maujuud hai, jo maanav mel ko puri tarah aise padaarthon main badal dete hai, jo pradooshan nahin failaate
 Such bacteria were developed in the microbiology laboratory
 vaigyanikon ne is bacteria kaa paanch degree celsius taapmaana se lekar 50 degree jaise ucch taapmaana par pareekshan kiya he
 The test was a complete success
 vaise ye bacteria shunya se neeche taapmaana (-55 degree tak) par bhi jivit rahete hai
 DRDE has named it bio-digester
 is pariyojna se jude vaigyanik bataate hai ki ye bacteria tab tak jinda rahenge, jab tak inke upar phenoyl yaa acid nahin daalaa jaae
 As soon as human feces come into contact, they perform these chemical reactions and convert it into many organic substances, such as amino acids and proteins
 yahi padaarth phir se rasaynic kriyaayein karke pani va methane main badal jate hai, jo pradooshan nahin karte
 This process happens on its own
 isamen kisi prakaar kii urja yaa rasaynic agent kii jarurat nahin hoti
 The disposal of human excreta has been a problem in India
 aaj bhi desh main 60 fisadi log khule main shouch karne ke liye jate hai
 According to information gathered under the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan, 57 percent of the households in the country do not have toilets
 madhya pradesh jaise rajyon main to abhi bhi 73 fisadi gharon (varsh 2012 ke aankadon ke mutabik) main shauchalay nahin hai
 Keeping this in mind, the Ministry of Rural Development of the Government of India has launched the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan, in which financial and technical assistance is provided to build toilets, but the problem of dirt remains in it
 isi khami ke chalate jairam ramesh kaa dhyaan is takanic par gaya, jise haal hi main bhartiya rail ne apanaaya he
 Railways started the work of keeping their trains and railway tracks clean by using bio-digester developed at DRDE Gwalior
 railway ne isaki shuruyaat gwalior se chalane vaali bundelkhand express main kii or ise desh kii pehali jaivik shauchalay yukt train kaa darja mila
 Buoyed by its success, the Railways is planning to install bio-digester toilets in all passenger coaches
 sirf railway hi nahin, balki aise sthanon par yah takanic kargar sabit hui he, jahaan par maanav mel pani main jaataa he
 The work of installing more than 10,000 bio-digester-containing toilets in the 2,500 km long Ganges Basin to Lakshadweep has started
 baio-digester takanic vaala shauchalay mahangaa bhi nahin he
 5,000 to 10,000 Rs
 main yah ban jaataa he
 The biggest thing is that it is not connected to any sewer line or septic tank
 isamen safai karne kii bhi jarurat nahin hoti
 Apart from this, the water derived from it can also be used in the field
 jairam ramesh ne kaha he ki is takanic ko gaanv-gaanv tak pahunchane ke liye mahila swayan sahaayta samoohon ko prashikshan diya jayega
 In the first phase, self-help groups from Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh will come to Gwalior and take training
 desh main dhai lakh panchayatein hai
 Of this, 25,000 have got the status of Nirmal Gram, which means they are clean
 ek dashak main sabhi gram panchayaton ko saaf karne kaa lakshya he
 drde's bio-digester will prove to be an important link in this
 ve ummid karte hai ki isse gaanvon kii surat badal jaaegi
 It is not necessary that only girls are deceived or fall in love
 zyada acha insaan pyaar or rishton ko nibhaane kii kshamta rakhata he
 That is why it is often seen that such people have to face deception and betrayal whether it is a girl or a boy
 haa yah mana ja saktaa he ki ladakiyon ko is tarah ke maamalon main zyada sahanubhuti or saport miltaa he
 At the same time, when something like this happens with good boys, they suppress it in their chest
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki unke saath hi aisa kyon hota he? aisa sab hone kii bahut sari vajahen ho sakati hai
 Know here some things that are enough to surprise you, due to which most boys fall prey to deception despite being good
 
 
 1
 Although most boys do not tell their partners about the relationship of the past, but honest boys start their life with the truth
 aise main ladki ko hameshaa hi is baat kaa shaq rahata he ki agar vah pehle kisi ko chhodkar uske paas aa saktaa he to use bhi to chhodkar kisi or ke paas ja saktaa he
 Because of this, the partners of such boys do not take them more seriously
 2
 Good boys are very caring and for this reason they believe in knowing everything about their partner, but it is not necessary that every girl likes their nature
 3
 Such boys believe in living life in a balanced way and for this he likes to follow certain rules and regulations
 kai barise logon ke partner unki eemaandaaree ko samaj nahin pateor nateeja aise ladakon se ladkiyaan katane lagati hai
 4
 har vakt apni partner kii aavbhagat karne vaale ladke bhi ladakiyon ko pasand nahin aate
 They need love but excessive care can bother them and they get an excuse to end the relationship on this matter
 5
 Whether you believe it or not, such boys always feel that whatever they do is right there
 aise ladakon ke saath ladkiyaan kabhi bhi rahanaa pasand nahin karti
 Therefore, it is good to keep going with the times and there is nothing wrong in keeping your partner happy by making a slight change in yourself

 monsoon satr apni gati ko praapt ho gaya
 The first monsoon session of the Modi government's tenure will be remembered in Indian political history for its inaction and deadlock
 aapako bataate hai, ve 5 vajahen jo is satr ko modi sarkaar ke liye bura sapana bana gayi
 1
 congress kii 'visphotak' aakraamakatayah durbhagyapurna lekin siyaasi taur par rochak baat he ki 44 congressi saansadon ne milakar lagbhag puraa monsoon satr chaupat kar diya
 After a long time in Indian political history, the Congress has looked so aggressive
 sonia or rahul ke alaava mallikarjun khadge, anand sharma or gulam nabi aaazaad ne sarkaar ke saamne sawaalon kii bauchhaar laga di
 The aggressive slogans, black strips and political sarcasm of Congressmen brought back memories of bjp's protests in the UPA era
 25 congressi saansadon ko loksabhaa spikar ne nilambit kar diya to sonia-rahul puure vipaksh ko saath lekar sansad bhawan parisar main chaar din tak niyamit pradarshan karte rahe
 Barring two statements from Sushma Swaraj in the last days, the BJP and the central government seemed helpless throughout the session despite a strong majority
 sansad main gatirodh kii bhi apni raajnneeti or nuksaan-phaayde hai, lekin sirf siyaasi pahalu kii baat karen to congress kaa aatmavishvaas kaaphi badha hua lagata he
 2
 sushamaa kaa shandaar palatvaravidesh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne lalit modi mudde par jawaab dete hue apni chir-parichit style main badhiya raajnneetik vaktavy diya
 He said, 'did i drive Lalit Modi from India? Did i stop the investigation against him? Did i request them to give me travel documents? No
 maine sirf yah faisla british sarkaar par saunp diya
 i had no role in the decision
 ve nirnay yatra dastavej na dene kaa bhi kar sakate the
 He cleverly gave an emotional color to the case by saying in the House that Lalit Modi's wife had been suffering from cancer for 17 years
 unhone yahaan tak kaha, 'main poochna chaahati hum ki koi or meri jagah hota to kya karata
 If Soniaji were there, what would she do? wo mahila jiske khilaaf duniya main koi cese nahin chal rahaa, jo 17 varshon se cancer se peedit he, jiskaa cancer 10veen baar ubhara he, aisi mahila kii madad karnaa agar gunaah he to adhyaksh ji aapako sakshi maanakar puure raashtra ke saamne apana gunaah kabool karti hum
 But Sushma's real statement came on Pratibhabeet Wednesday when Rahul asked her to account for the 'transaction' she received from Lalit Modi
 is par kisi tarah kii safai dene ke bajaae sushamaa ne counter atake kii niti apanaai or kam se kam us din congress ke hamalavar tinkon ko dhwast kar diya
 Giving Rahul the opportunity to read the history of the Congress during the holidays, he said, 'rahul Gandhi asks me how much money i took
 rahul gandhi apni mamma se puuchhen ki kwatroki ko chhudaane ke liye unhen kitna paisa mila tha
 They read all the works from Quattrocchi to Shaharyar alone and ask Mama, how much money we took from them to drive away Quattrocchi

 Karan Wahi is the church face of the TV industry, has also anchored in several shows
 lekin mistar bajaj ke syrius killer luk main wo kitne feet baithte hai ye dekhne ke baad hi maaloom padegaa
 Ronit Rai had portrayed this character in the first season of Kasauti so brilliantly that its benchmark among fans is very high, so it is not easy to play this role for Karan Wahi

 passbook kii suraksha kii javaabadari inhen graminon par hoti he, bank khulne ke baad apni baari se graahak apni rakam jamaa bhi kar rahe he or nikaal bhi rahe he
 In the midst of all this rhetoric, the mutual understanding of the villagers is highly appreciated

 At the box office, the first Friday of August was no less than an accident
 sitaron kii teen badi filmein hone ke baavjood box offis par us tarah kii raunak nahin dekhne ko mili, jaisaa ki is saal pichley kuch maheenon tikat khidki par paison kii bauchhaar hoti rahi
 The presence of stars like Rishi Kapoor, Taapsee Pannu, Anil Kapoor, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Rajkumar Rao and Irrfan also did not impress the audience
 ek tarah se pichhlaa shuukravaar box offis par saal kii sabase badi bhidnt bhi thi
 On the first Friday of August, films like Mulk, Fanney Khan and Caravan were released
 lekin charchaa, prashansa or bade sitaron kii maujuudagi kaa koi fark nahin padaa
 The fate of the three films released on the first Friday of August at the ticket window is like a disaster
 teenon filmein aundhe munh gir gayi
 This is the weekend of the first week in August, 'caravan' 8 till the weekend in the Indian market
 10 karod rupee kii kamai kii thi
 The film's opening collection is just 1
 60 karod rupee hi tha
 The condition of the "country" was more or less similar
 ye film weekend main sirf 8
 16 crores succeeded in earning Rs
 jabaki samikshakon ne donon filmon kii acchhee samikshaayen karte hue 'must vaach movies' kii category main rakhaa
 Due to the starcast and the story, 'fanney Khan' was also discussed before the release
 baavjood ye film box offis par koi kamaal nahin dikhaa pai
 According to reports, the film made only 7 in the first four days
 5 karod rupee kaa kaarobaar kiya
 There is no film of big stars in the second week as well
 le-dekar camel hasan kii 'vishvarupam 2' se duusare hafte main kuch ummid kii ja sakati he
 However, the track record of Kamal Haasan's last few films at the box office is pointing to the fact that Hindi audiences can reject Vishwaroopam 2
 yani agast ke pehle 15 din, box offis par sookhe kii tarah hi rahenge
 Anticipating loss from Gold and Satyamev Jayate, Akshay Kumar's period drama 'gold' and John abraham-manoj Vajpayee's thriller 'satyamev Jayate' are also expected to have an impact on the earnings this month
 Can not be denied
 donon filmein swatantraaa diwas par relies ho rahi hai
 Big Starcast and the trailers for both are effective
 haalanki akshay or jon abraham ne donon filmon kii bhidnt main kaarobaar par asar padane kii ashanka ko khaarij kiya he, screens or kaarobaar main bantwaare kii baat khaarij nahin kii ja sakati
 This has happened very rarely in the history of Bollywood when both films have achieved success in the box collision of two big stars
 kam se kam film trade se jude log chahenge ki donon hi filmein badi hit sabit hon
 But if Hashr remains like the first Friday, then this year August will prove to be the worst in terms of Bollywood business

 After that the team also lost the tri series to South Africa

 raju honge party ke policy group or civil socity ke bich kii kadicongress party ke netaaon or kisi vishay ke jaankaron ke bich raay banane ke liye charchaa karaane or phir party kii niti ko antim rup dene kii jimmedaari upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke kareebi ke
 Will be given to Raju
 wo ek tareeke se group ke sanyojak kii bhoomika main honge
 Finally, the final seal will be put on it by Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 shuruyaat hogi ajukeshan policy secongress ko lagata he ki bijepi sarkaar apni nai shiksha niti main tamaam badlaav kar sakati he
 The stature of old icons can be reduced, the role of all people including Nehru, Indira in history can be weakened
 saath hi bijepi apane pasandida logon keeitihaas membedi bhoomika bataane kii koshish bhi kar sakati he
 Overall, the Congress feels that there can be saffronisation of education
 isliye sabase pehle party isi disha main pahal karne ja rahi he
 Experts in the education sector including experts from all educational institutions including JNU, BHU, along with leaders of education including former HRD Minister Kapil Sibal, Veerappa Moily will be taken
 jiske baad party apni shiksha niti saamne lekar aegi
 The message that will be given through the policy is that when it is brought to the public, it will also be clear that those who are away from politics have played a role in making it
 darasal, iske jariye party ye sandesh dena chaahegi ki wo jo niti saamne laa rahi he, vahi sachai he or kisi ke paksh main jhuki hui nahin he
 Whereas on the contrary, the policy of the government has been fabricated for a particular aspect by distorting the facts
 samaaj se jude or bhi muddon par bhi najarasutron kii maane to ye vyavastha sirf shiksha niti tak hi simit nahin rahegi
 Then whether it is foreign policy, defense policy, economic policy or other issues related to society, the Congress will bring its policy through this partnership only
 yani party ke us khaas kshetra se jude yaa usamen ruchi yaa jaankaree rakhane vaale netaa or us kshetra vishesh ke jaankaar milakar party kii niti tay karenge
 After all, why is the Congress going to take this step? Actually, the Congress party feels that there has been a change in the society and its thinking in recent times
 duusari taraf party ko lagata he ki bijepi or uske samarthakon kaa propaganda aam janata ko bargala rahaa he
 At the same time, as a political party, the public sees everyone with suspicion
 isliye tamaam niti nirdhaaran ke maamle main swatantra jaankaron, vichaarkon or visheshgyon ke jariye wo aam janata ko us sachai se rubaru kara paaegi jisko wo chaahati he
 And in this way, she will be able to form public opinion against the policies of the government

 ' Chief Justice said - Hearing of the case completed before 18 October can be extended with the approval of the President
 The tenure of the Chief Justice has been asked by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Ranjan Gogoi to complete the hearing of Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid case before 18 October
 chif justise gogoi ne kaha ki agar maamle kii sunwaayee 18 oktober tak puri nahin hui, to is par faisla dene kaa chance khatm ho jayega
 In fact, the Constitution Bench of five Justices headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi is hearing the case and Chief Justice Gogoi is retiring on November 17
 kaarykaal khatm hone ke baad ranjan gogoi na to maamle kii sunwaayee kar paaenge or na hi faisla suna paaenge
 Therefore, he wants a decision on the matter before it is retired
 ab yahaan sawaal yah uth rahaa he ki agar ram janmabhumi-babari masjid maamle kii sunwaayee lambii khinchati he, to maamle par faisla koun sunayega? kya is maamle kii sunwaayee karne or faisla sunaane ke liye ranjan gogoi kaa kaarykaal badhaayaa ja saktaa he?ritair hone ke baad bhi faisla suna sakate hai ranjan gogoiis par supreme court baar association ke upaadhyaksh jitendra mohan sharma or senior edwocket upendra mishra kaa kahana he ki abhi tak supreme court ke kisi bhi nyaayamurti kaa kaarykaal nahin badhaayaa gaya he
 Although Article 128 of the Constitution provides that the retiring justice can be empowered to hear a case with the consent of the President, such a judge will not be empowered to hear other matters like other judges of the Supreme Court
 
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki agar ram janmabhumi-babari masjid maamle kii sunwaayee lambii chalati he, to raashtrapati kii sahmati se chif justise ranjan gogoi aage bhi maamle kii sunwaayee kar sakate hai
 Its provision has been made in the Constitution
 haalanki ranjan gogoi ko supreme court ke kisi duusare nyaayamurti yaa chif justise kii tarah adhikaar nahin honge
 They will only be able to hear the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid case and give their verdict
 sunwaayee karne vaali bench ke nyaayamurti hi sunaate hai faislabhi tak yah parampara rahi he ki supreme court ke nyaayamurtiyon kii jo bench maamle kii sunwaayee karti he, vahi us par faisla sunaati he
 If the Justice of that Bench retires, a new Bench is constituted to hear that case
 iske baad nai bench us maamle kii nae sire se sunwaayee karti he
 Can other justices also pronounce the verdict? At the same time, Vishnu Shankar Jain, Advocate of the Hindu Mahasabha, says that under Article 128 of the Constitution, the President has the right to extend the term of retiring justice for hearing a case
 iske saath hi civil prakriya samhita yani sipisi ke order 20 ke tahat yah praavdhaan kiya gaya he ki agar koi jaj kisi civil maamle par faisla likh detaa he, lekin uskaa elaan nahin karata he, to uski jagah lene vaala aglaa jaj us faisle kaa elaan kar saktaa he
 This means that if the judge Justice Ranjan Gogoi is unable to pronounce the verdict after completing the hearing of the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid case, then the second judge to replace him will pronounce the verdict
 ram janmabhumi-babari masjid maamla ek civil maamla he
 Therefore, order 20 of CPC applies in this case
 in nyaayamurtiyon kii samvidhan peeth kar rahi he sunwaayee6 agast se ram janmabhumi-babari masjid maamle kii rojaanaa sunwaayee ho rahi he
 The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court which is hearing this case consists of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justice SA Bobde, Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice Abdul Nazir
 chif justise ranjan gogoi ne pakshakaron ko maamle kii sunwaayee 18 oktober se pehle puri karne kaa nirdesh diya he
 The constitution bench hearing the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid case is headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi
 lihaaja unako hi maamle par faisle kaa elaan karne kaa adhikaar he

 rashtriya janata dal ke varisht upaadhyaksh shivanand tiwari ne vaada kiya he ki agar unki party kii sarkaar aayi to sharabbandi ke sabhi maamle waapas liye jaaenge
 In a press conference held in Patna on Monday, Tiwari made it clear that since most of the poor, Dalit people are in jail in this case, the party will withdraw all the cases to give them relief
 rajd shuru se sharabbandi ke kilaaf rahi he or uskaa maananaa he ki ye fail ho chukaa he
 Knowledgeable people tell a big reason for this because they are close to RJD chief Lalu Yadav of people engaged in alcoholism
 tippaniyan At the same time, in the assembly by-elections, whether he is Tejashwi Yadav or Rabri Devi, in his speech, he definitely does mention
 somvaar ko jahanabad main prachaar karte hue rabari devi ne kaha ki ab home delivery se bedroom tak sharaab logon ke ghar par pahunchaai ja rahi he
 In the state, many times the number of people who did not go to jail during the Emergency, are eating the air of the prison in the affair of prohibition in two years
 rajd kaa maananaa he ki sharabbandi par ek tabaqa jisamen mahila varg pramukh he, wo jahaan nitish ke kilaaf kuch sun nahin saktaa vahiin ek aisa tabaqa he jo nitish ke is faisale or uske kriyanvayan se itnaa naaraaz he ki wo kisi bhi haalat main nitish ke samarthan main vot ab nahin degaa or rajd kaa prayaas aise varg ko apane saath jodne kaa he

 RJD believes that a section on liquor ban in which the female class is prominent, where it cannot hear anything against Nitish, there is a section which is so annoyed with Nitish's decision and its implementation that in any condition he supports Nitish
 i will no longer vote and RJD attempts to integrate such a class with itself

 a post shared byhuma Qureshi (@iamhumaq) onjun 14, 2019 at 12:55 am PDT Arif Zakaria's work in the character of Guru Maa is so great that he hates seeing it in the first episode itself
 aarif ne ek nirdayee aadmi ke kirdaar ko itane achche se nibhaayaa he ki aapke man se unke liye acchhee baaten to bilkul nahin niklengi
 Raising your hands on women, extreme bigotry about your religion, killing a person who stands against Aryavarta, all these things are in his character of Guru Ma, which you will get to see and Arif does not have an answer in this role
 
 siddharth ek badhiya actor hai, ye baat unhone samay-samay par darshakon ke saamne sabit kii he
 Siddharth, who is remembered for the film Rang De Basanti, has also done a good job in Laila
 unka kirdaar is siries main kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 While you have created a thought for Siddharth's character Bhanu, he gives you a surprise, seeing which you will like this character
 in teenon ke alaava chote rolls main rahul khanna, seemaa biswas, sanjay suri or akaash khurana ne apane kirdaaron ko achche se nibhaayaa
 Sanjay Suri's face has been given less screen time than you often get to see in the entire series
 seemaa biswas kaa kaam aapako acha lagegaa or unke kirdaar par gussa bhi aayega

 ) BJP and Congress are engaged in manipulation to form government in Manipur
 ravivaar ko bijepi ke netaaon ne rajyapal se milakar bahumat kaa daawa kiya
 On the other hand, Congress leader and Chief Minister Ibobi Singh gave a new twist to the story
 ibobi singh ne congress ke paas bahumat kaa daawa kiya
 'NPP with Congress' Ibobi Singh claimed support of National People's Party
 unhone enpipi ke samarthan vaala patr bhi jari kiya
 This letter has been written to the Governor in the name of National People's Party General Secretary Vivekraj
 12 march taarikh vaale is patr main likhaa he- hamaari party ne vidhansabha chunaav main chaar siten jiti hai or rajya main nai sarkaar banane ke liye ham apana samarthan congress party ko dete hai jo ki sabase badi party bani he
 Ibobi Singh also met Governor Najma Heptulla on Sunday night, with a letter from the Governor supporting the ibobinpp
 ibobi ne enpipi kaa samarthan congress ke saath hone kaa daawa kiya
 Ibobi offered the governor a claim to form the government
 ibobi ne kaha- congress sabase zyada seat jitkar badi party bani he, aise main bahumat sabit karne kaa pehla mauka unhen milanaa chahie
 No one got majority
 Actually no party has got majority in Manipur
 manipur main vidhansabha kii 60 siten hai
 The Congress became the largest party by winning 28 seats
 jabaki bijepi ko 21 siten mili hai
 In such a situation, no party has touched the magic figure of 31 seats
 vahiin neshnal pipuls party (enpipi) or naga pipuls front (enpief) ko 4-4 siten mili hai
 Apart from these, LJP, Trinamool Congress and independents have also got one seat each
 sarkaar banane ke liye congress ko 3 vidhayakon kii jarurat he
 The Congress claims that it has the strength of 32 mlas in the Legislative Assembly with the support of 4 National People's Party mlas
 ek taraf bijepi ne sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kar diya he
 On the other hand, the Congress is beating the beat of its majority
 ab dekhnaa hoga rajyapal kis party kaa daawa sahi maanati hai or use sarkaar banane ke liye bulaati hai
 In Jharkhand, only one rupee is available in the name of women
 Up to now, one and a half lakh women have become land and house owners
 Jharkhand is the first state in the country where women become property owners for just one rupee
 do saal pehle suvidha shuru hone ke baad ab tak dedh lakh mahilaayein is yojana kaa laabh uthaa chuki hai
 In other states of the country, women also get some percentage exemption in the registries, but nowhere is the facility of registration of land or house in one rupee
 dilli main mahilaon ko chaar pratishat stamp duty deni padati he to upi main stamp shulk main sirf ek pratishat hi chhot milti he
 Jharkhand usually pays 6 to 7 per cent of the registry fee
 aise main tamaam parivaar mahilaon ke naam registry kar stamp shulk kii baari bachat kar rahe hai
 Chief Minister Raghubar Das tweeted on Thursday and gave the figure of one and a half lakh women availing this scheme
 unhone twit karte hue likhaa,"jharkhand desh kaa pehla rajya he jahaan mahilaon ke liye 50 lakh rupee tak kii jameen / makaan kii registry sirf ek rupee main hoti he
 So far, more than one and a half lakh women have become landlords
 "darasal, pradhanmantri narendra modi ne nari shashaktikaran liye mahilaon ke naam par ghar-jameen kii registry kii apil kii thi
 After which, in 2017, the Jharkhand cabinet decided to give registry facility to women for just one rupee
 iske anusaar, is chhot kaa laabh lene ke liye mahila ko shapath patr daayar karnaa hota he ki is tarah kii chhot kaa vah pehali baar laabh le rahi he
 According to the rule, a woman can take the benefit of the registry in one rupee only once
 purush ke saath registry karaane par koi chhot nahin milegi
 On the other hand, if two women jointly register the property, they will get the benefit
 haalanki 50 lakh se zyada sampatti kii keemat hone par mahilaon ko atirikt raashi par stamp duty kaa bhugtan karnaa hoga
 Jharkhand is the first state in the country where registry of land / house up to Rs 50 lakh for women is done in just one rupee
 ab tak dedh lakh se zyada mahilaayein ban chuki hai makaan malkin

 com / 3hxgnxeyux— Raghubar Das (@dasraghubar) September 5, 2019 BJP gave example of Jharkhand: In Delhi too, there has been a demand for women to give duty exemption facility in the registry like Jharkhand
 bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari purv main mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko chitthee likhakar mahilaon ko 4 pratishat registry shulk maaf karne kii maang kar chuke hai
 He had said that this will increase women's empowerment and social security will also be increased by having assets in the name of women
 iske liye manoj tiwari ne bijepi shasit rajya jharkhand kaa bhi hawala diya
 Heavy rains in Akola and Shirdi have also increased the water level of the rivers
 purvi vidarbha or sookhe se jujh rahe marathavada ke bhi kai ilaakon main baadh jaise halaat ban gaye hai
 The Meteorological Department has also warned of heavy rain in these areas in the next 24 hours

 ) The Delhi High Court has reprimanded the Arvind Kejriwal government over the condition of night shelters in Delhi
 rain baseron main maut ke maamle main naaraazgi jataate hue court ne dilli sarkaar ko chaar hafton main report dene kaa aadesh diya he
 Let us tell you that many social organizations have complained against the Delhi government regarding the issue of rain shelter
 unka aarope he ki dilli sarkaar unki andekhi kar rahi he
 Apart from this, official figures show that 178 deaths occurred due to cold in Delhi this year
 maamle kii sunwaayee karte hue dilli hoicourt ne kaha, 'dilli main rain baseron kii sthiti sudhaarney ke liye sarkaar ne vibhinn agenciyon se baatcheet nahin kii
 The High Court also questioned the attitude of the AAP government
 hoicourt ne shahari vikaas mantralay se poocha ki rain baseron kii haalat sudhaarney ke liye yojit baithak main saamaajik sanghathanon ko kyon nahin bulaayaa gaya? jawaab main dilli sarkaar ne kaha ki talmail bithaane ke liye sarkaar dilli police ke sampark main he
 The High Court has ordered the Delhi government to call a meeting on this issue and report should be filed within four weeks
 meeting main dilli police rain baseron main thand ke kaaran mare hue logon kii posmartem report bhi pesh kare
 Apart from this, the police should also answer the allegations of harassing the people living in the night shelters
 madhya pradesh main vyaapman ghotaale main ab bada sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kisi agenda ke tahat badi jaanch nahin hone de rahe the yaa phir vah bas chup hi rahanaa chaahate the
 Is the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh really whistleblower
 vidhansabha ke pichley aath saal ke ricard khangaalane par kuch alag hi sach ubhar rahaa he
 In the Legislative Assembly in November 2009, Independent MLA Paras Saklecha asked Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan whether irregularities were happening in the state's pre-medical test i
e
 PMT
 At that time the government replied that information was being gathered in the case
 yah pehali baar tha jab rajya ke kai shaharon main dabi jubaan main jo kuch kaha suna ja rahaa tha vah khulkar vidhansabha main uth gaya
 Many questions were asked to the Chief Minister in the Vidhan Sabha in a single day
 dabaav main hi sahi piemti main gadabadi kii shikaayat ke sawaal par mukhyamantri ne ek cameti gathit kar di
 Shivraj was then responsible for the state's medical education
 rajya main jo kuch ho rahaa tha, usko lekar ek baar phir 31 march 2011 ko vidhansabha main sawaal uthaa
 During the Question Hour, MLA Pratap Girewal asked the Chief Minister how many fake admissions were made in medical colleges and dental colleges from 2007 to 2010
 is par mukhyamantri ne jawaab diya ki 31 march 2011 tak kisi bhi fazi chaatr kii pahchaan nahin hui he
 Questions once again besieged the Chief Minister on 29 November 2011
 ab sawaal poocha gaya ki mukhyamantri ne jo cameti banaai, usamen koun-koun the or kitni gadabadiyaan pai gayi
 The Chief Minister himself replied that 114 students have been identified and the officers of Vyapam, Medical Department, Medical Colleges have been engaged in the investigation, but in this reply, the Chief Minister did not say anywhere how long the investigation will be completed and the reality It is that this committee never gave its report
 is par ratlam ke tatkaaleen vidhayak paras sakalechaa kehete hai, 'mukhyamantri baar baar vakt lete rahe
 Did not appear to favor any investigation
 is maamle main uth rahe sawaalon par mukhyamantri kii chuppi aage bhi jari rahi

 At that time the government replied that information was being gathered in the case
 yah pehali baar tha jab rajya ke kai shaharon main dabi jubaan main jo kuch kaha suna ja rahaa tha vah khulkar vidhansabha main uth gaya
 Many questions were asked to the Chief Minister in the Vidhan Sabha in a single day
 dabaav main hi sahi piemti main gadabadi kii shikaayat ke sawaal par mukhyamantri ne ek cameti gathit kar di
 Shivraj was then responsible for the state's medical education
 rajya main jo kuch ho rahaa tha, usko lekar ek baar phir 31 march 2011 ko vidhansabha main sawaal uthaa
 During the Question Hour, MLA Pratap Girewal asked the Chief Minister how many fake admissions were made in medical colleges and dental colleges from 2007 to 2010
 is par mukhyamantri ne jawaab diya ki 31 march 2011 tak kisi bhi fazi chaatr kii pahchaan nahin hui he
 Questions once again besieged the Chief Minister on 29 November 2011
 ab sawaal poocha gaya ki mukhyamantri ne jo cameti banaai, usamen koun-koun the or kitni gadabadiyaan pai gayi
 The Chief Minister himself replied that 114 students have been identified and the officers of Vyapam, Medical Department, Medical Colleges have been engaged in the investigation, but in this reply, the Chief Minister did not say anywhere how long the investigation will be completed and the reality It is that this committee never gave its report
 is par ratlam ke tatkaaleen vidhayak paras sakalechaa kehete hai, 'mukhyamantri baar baar vakt lete rahe

 sawaalon ne ek baar phir 29 november 2011 ko mukhyamantri ko gheraa gaya
 Now the question was asked, who were the people and how many mistakes were found in the committee formed by the Chief Minister
 khud mukhyamantri ne jawaab diya ki 114 chaatro kii pahchaan hui he or jaanch main vyaapman ke adhikari, chikitsa vibhaag, medical collejon ke adhikari lagaae gaye hai, lekin is jawaab main mukhyamantri ne kahin bhi yah nahin kaha ki jaanch kab tak puri hogi or hakeekat yah he ki is cameti ne kabhi apni report nahin di

 com / syrbwqz0iz Politics has once again intensified over cows within Chhattisgarh
 raipur nagar nigam ne gaay ko shahar mata ghoshit kar diya he
 At the same time, the officers do not understand under which rule they give the status of mother to the cow
 aamtaur par meyar ko shahar kaa pratham naagarik mana jaataa he
 After declaring the cow as the city mother, the Congress has started teasing the BJP
 congress ne tark diya he ki ve gaay ko lekar bijepi kii tarah raajnneeti nahin karte
 Rather, we respect the cow in the true sense
 chhattisgarh main in dinon congressiyon kaa gau prem dekhte hi ban rahaa he
 a Congress leader is giving fodder to the cow
 koi dulaar kar rahaa he to koi gaay ko pradarshan kaa jariya bana kar bijepi kii bakhiya udhed rahaa he
 The Municipal Corporation of Raipur has passed a resolution proclaiming the cow as the city mother
 is nagar nigam par congress kaa kabja he
 Therefore, by giving respect to cow as the status of city mother, the Congressmen are not fulfilling Phule
 gaay ko bhale hi aamajanon kii bhashaa main gau mata kaha jaae lekin vidhivat rup se gau mata kehane ke liye samvidhan main koi ullekh nahin he
 The same situation also exists in the Municipalities Act
 nagar palika adhinium main shahar kaa pratham naagarik ghoshit karne ko lekar baqayda niyam prakriya darj he
 But there is no provision to declare an animal as the city mother
 afasar maathapai kar rahe he ki aakhir kis niyam or prakriya ke tahat gaay ko nagar mata ghoshit karne vaale prastaav par ve apni muhar lagaaein
 Unaware of all these things, the mayor passed the proposed resolution and gave his decision
 raipur shahar ke meyar pramod dube ke mutabik chhattisgarh kii rajdhani main gau mata ko nagar mata banaae jane kaa prastaav sabhi ne paarit kiya he
 They say that even after the Mughal period, we consider cow to be matriarchal, but do we work honestly towards them? There is a lot of difference between saying something and actually doing things
 rajya main gaay ke mudde par congressi acroshit hai
 The party has laid siege to the BJP over the death of cows in various cows in the state
 yahi nahin gaayon ko bachaane ke liye congress ne baqayda abhiyaan ched rakhaa he
 They are also agitating by talking about the BJP killing Kogou
 party kaa aarope he ki bijepi sirf gaay ko lekar raajnneeti karti he
 At the same time, Congress is a party that honors the cow
 congress adhyaksh bhupesh baghel kehete hai ki bijepi is maamle main keval raajnneeti kar rahi he
 After all, which religion is it to kill people in the name of cow? They consider it violence and protest
 bijepi kar rahi he bachaavgaay ke mudde par hameshaa mukharata se raajnneeti karne vaali bijepi aaj bachaav kii mudra main he
 Recently, more than 36 cows died in three gaushalas of the state
 yah teenon hi gaushalaayein bijepi netaaon kii thim
 Therefore, the BJP is in the grip of the Congress attack
 use congress kaa gaay ko shahar mata qaraar dene kaa mudda gale se nahin utar rahaa he
 They are arguing that the cow holds the status of cow mother since time immemorial
 bijepi shashit rajyon main gaay surakshit he 
 The talk of the death of cows in the gaushalas of BJP leaders not only gave the accused worker a hawala visit, but also formed a Judicial Commission to safe guard the cows
 philhal gaay ke mudde parabijepi or congressdonon hi partiyon ke netaa aamane-saamne aa gaye hai
 There is a war between the two parties over cow service
 aane vaale dinon main is mudde ke or bhi garmane ke asaar hai

 Book: Family Life Writer: Akhil Sharmaprakash: Penguin India Page: 228 Price: 499 (hard Cover) Akhil Sharma is a writer of Indian origin
 dilli main janme or america jaakar bas gaye
 His first novel 'an Obedient Father' came out in 2000
 2014 main aae unke upanyaas 'family life' ko da neuyork times book rivyuu ne 2014 kii sheersh das kitabon kii suchi main shaamil kiya
 Akhil has also received the 2015 Folio Award for the same book
 mishra parivaar dilli main rahaa karata tha
 This was the period
 jab immergency ke baad is aam bharatiyon kaa sarkaar se mohabhang ho jaataa he
 Akhil has given this disillusionment to the mouth of Ajay's mother, 'that woman Indira will eat us
 'mishra parivaar dilli se jaakar america ke queens main bas jaataa he
 Right now he does not even get fixed in the way that Ajay's elder brother Birju becomes an accident and goes into a coma
 baaki kahani ajay ke akelepan, uski dharmik ho chali maa or sharaabi pita ke bare main he
 Ajay is surrounded by guilt
 skool main apane bhai ke bare main jhooth bol sahanubhuti batorne kii koshish karata he
 Talks to trees kaalpanik bhagwaan banaata he
 Hides in a blanket and talks to his God
 ek jagah ajay kahata he
 'god looks like Clark Kent
 wo bhura cardigan or slacks pahante hai
 When i first started talking to him after the accident, he looked like Krishna
 par bevakoofana lagata he ki aap aise kisi ke saath brain damege kii baat karo jo nila he, bansi rakhata he or uske sir par mor kaa pankh laga rahata he
 'akhil Sharma has been successful in showing how an accident has an effect on the child of the house
 kul jamaa kitaab autobiographical he, jo traasadee jhel rahe ek parivaar ke har pahalu ko dikhaati he
 Now that the people of Delhi have voted, everyone is waiting for the results
 zyaadaatar news channelon ke survey bataa rahen he ki dilli main aam aadmi party kii sarkaar banegi or bijepi ke haath ek baar phir dilli kii gaddi aate-aate rah jaaegi
 Although only speculations are being made right now, nothing can be said for sure
 raajnneeti kii hawa kaa rukh badalane main der kitni lagati he
 By the way, if bjp's share is lost, no one else and only BJP will be responsible for it
 kehane kaa matlab he ki yah kejariwal kii jeet se zyada bijepi kii haar hogi or vah bhi apni galatiyon kii vajah se or kaaphi had tak ab tak tamaam rajyon main mili jeet kii atmamugdhata evam dambh kii vajah se
 Kiran Bedi was the first to talk
 
 
 aakhir bijepi kii mukhyamantri pad kii ummidavaar jo thahrin
 Betting on Bedi proved to be possibly counterproductive for the BJP
 agar bijepi pehle unhen party main lekar aati, to shaayad virodh ke itane swar hi nahin uthte
 If the party did not declare anyone as the chief ministerial candidate, then all the BJP leaders of Delhi would try diligently to get the cm's chair
 lekin jaise hi bedi kaa naam aayaa, sab ke sapane dhare ke dhare rah gaye
 There is no doubt that Bedi is no less trustworthy than Kejriwal, his image is honest and strong too, but he is not a leader who can understand politics like Kejriwal
 bijepi kaa master stroke deree se lagane kii vajah se vah na to chaukaa maar pai or na hi chakka
 The small mistakes of Kesar Bedi were corrected
 mukhyamantri pad kii ummidavaar ghoshit hone se pehle kaaryaktaaon or phir baad main dilli ke saasandon ko ghar bulaakar jis andaaj main unhone meeting lee, isse galat sandesh gaya
 Later, there was an attempt to control damage, but it was late
 'aap' or congress kii tulana main bijepi ne bahut baad main jaakar apane candident ghoshit kiye
 This gave him only 15 to 20 days to go out in public and say his words
 apane majboot candident chhodkar baahar se aae netaaon ko tikat dena bhi bijepi par baari padaa he
 The results will show how suicidal it is to give tickets to leaders like Binny and Krishna Tirath
 party ke andar bhitarghaat is kadar haaavee tha ki kai jagah par aisa laga ki sanghathan chunaav hi nahin lard rahaa he
 The news is also that not all decisions are taken together, only a few leaders have taken
 ummidavaaron ke chayan main kaaphi laaparvaahee barti gai
 The state party president did not even get a ticket
 saalon party main rahe kaaryaktaaon kii andekhi kii gai, jisase unke andar niraashaa faili or ve ghar se baahar hi nahin nikle or jab tak unhen nikaalane kii koshish hui, tab tak bahut der ho chuki thi
 The party did not release the manifesto and the vision document was replaced in its place
 isamen saaf-saaf kuch bhi nahin tha, masalan bijli or pani ke rate kitne kam karenge
 
 
 That is, in the vision document, the bus ritual payment was more visible
 bina vajah dilli ke chunaav main itane mantri or netaaon ko utaara gaya
 The kind of tongue the Prime Minister himself used, the profit was less, the loss was more
 personal atake ko kejariwal ne jis tarah se turn kiya, usase bijepi ko nuksaan hi hua or kejariwal ko sahanubhuti mili
 Wise people say that 'attack the enemy only when the injured is groaning, do not give him a chance to recover
 use kamjor bhi mat samajho
 ' agar bijepi loksabhaa chunaav ke thik baad chunaav karwaati, to nattejey kuch or hote
 But he gave 'aap' a chance to recover
 nattejey sabake saamne aane vaale hai
 Not only this, the party could not even respond in a manner to the attack of AAP
 updravi gotra ko lekar jis tarah se kejariwal ne puure agarwal samaaj ko updravi gotra se joda
 The BJP did not think of any answer
 'aap' ke netaa yogendra yadav ne pradhanmantri modi ke bhaashan kii sadak chhap se tulana kii, par bijepi ne is par damdaar tareeke se virodh nahin darj karaayaa
 The RSS in Delhi, which was once a Jana Sangh stronghold, did not openly help the BJP like the Lok Sabha elections
 yah bhi kah sakate hai ki party ne khulkar madad lene kii jarurat nahin samajhi
 The BJP felt that it would win on its own, but some party leaders are also saying in a loud voice that if they lose the Delhi elections, it is good, it will open their eyes and with this lesson the party in Bihar and Bengal may Do not repeat mistakes and perform well

 aise samay main jab aarthik vikaas dar dhalaan par he or arthvyavastha ko sahare kii jarurat he tab kyon arabiai ne repo rate main koi badlaav nahin kiya? jabaki tamaam arthshaastri nitigat daron main chauthai aadhaar ank kii katautee kii ummid lagaae baithe the
 Earlier, the RBI lowered the interest rate 5 times during February to October
 kul katautee 135 basis point kii rahi, haalanki bank abhi aadhi katautee bhi graahakon tak nahin pahunchaa paae hai
 There are three major reasons why the RBI will not cut interest rates
 pehali, badhati mahangaai, duusari bajet kaa intjaar or teesraa karj kii maang kaa na badhanaa
 Retail inflation has gone above the rbi's medium-term target

 RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das believes that inflation is seasonal

 But if food inflation is eliminated, there is no major improvement in core inflation

 What is the guarantee that even if the cut in the five interest rates by the RBI could not support consumption, then it will be supported by a cut of four per cent

 In such a situation, how the market will change with a further reduction of quarter percent which can also be considered as a lower level
 arabiai ne policy par najariya ‘akomadative’ hi rakhaa he
 That is, there is still room for interest rate cuts
 lekin yah katautee karne se pehle arabiai ke empisi sadsy vitt mantri kaa bajet bhaashan sunanaa chahenge
 Not only cheap loans are enough to support the economy, but big investments are needed
 badi sankhya main aarthik gatividhiyon (badi pariyojnaon) ko shuru karke arthvyavastha ko sahaara diya ja saktaa he
 For this, leaving the discipline of fiscal deficit, the government will have to increase investment by taking huge debt
 arabiai badhane nivesh ke bich karj ko sasta kar iconomi ko dabl booster dene kaa mauka khona nahin chahega
 Yet another cut of a quarter per cent will not bring big changes in the current Surat a Hall, but with a large investment, a strong debt can increase investor confidence

 Tanushree said that the stars are afraid of Kangana's talent, so they (kangana) do not come with them
 tanushri ne ek lanbaa bayaan jari kiya he
 In it she says- "kangana Ranaut is a real a ++ lister actress

 " Today the biggest question in front of the country is why this inflation is not stopping
 aakhir kyon sarkaar kii har koshish naakaam sabit ho rahi he
 After all, why is the common man forced to scorch
 taiyaar rahiye nai mahangaai ke liye, taiyaar rahiye jeb kataai ke liye, taiyaar rahiye jaruratein ghataane ke liye, taiyaar rahiye khushiyaan lutaaney ke liye
 By the way, now it has become a habit of life
 lekin, dil main har baar tis to uthati hi he jab jindagi kii kuch jaruraton main nai katautee ho jaati he
 Preparations are underway to launch a new installment of inflation
 sarkaar inhen koshishon main lagi hui he ki kaise mahangaai ke nae jatke die jaaen
 New arguments are being made one after another to justify the new installment of inflation on your shoulder
 kendriya krishi rajyamantri harish ravat ne to saaf taur par kah diya he ki ab sabsidi ko khatm kar diya jaae

 We have to save the oil companies
 ab desh ke mantri aise hai, to phir kahana hi kya
 They are worried about the oil companies but not the common people
 jab desh main nitiyaan tel companiyon ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi banani hai phir to aam log apni bhalaai khud hi soch len
 If the matter has started with the oil companies, then listen to their arguments as well
 companiyaan ro rahi hai nuksaan kaa ronaa, wo kahati hai ki petrol kii bikri par unhen 5 rupye prati litre kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 The loss on diesel is more than Rs 19
 kerosine ke prati litre kii bikri par nuksaan 34 rupye se zyada kaa bataaya ja rahaa he or rasoi gas main har silendar par nuksaan 350 rupye kaa ho rahaa he
 It is obvious that the oil companies and the government have every excuse to shed tears
 or jab mantri ji aansu ponchney ke liye khud khadey hai to phir aansu bhi zyada nikalne lagate hai
 Yes, if the minister does not see the tear, then it is the common people
 har taraf se mahangaai kii maar he or aam log use jhalne ko majaboor
 The pain of the common people is nothing more than waste for the government and oil companies
 desh ke vikaas ke naam par aam janata kii jeb kaatane kaa silsilaa jari he
 The only question is that the people who are filling their needs and filling the coffers of the country and the oil companies, why do they not see the effect of the so-called development of this country
 sawaal ye bhi he ki mana tel kii tijori bharna jaruri he, logon kii sabji kii theliyaan kyon khaali ho rahi hai
 If you listen to the minister's answer, it will look like someone has put salt on the burn
 mantri ji, aapane to ye kahkar apana pallaa chhudaa liya ki kuch mahangaai mausami he
 Minister, how can you tell that hunger does not feel by seeing the weather
 aapako kaise bataaen ki amiron or garibon ke thikaane alag ho sakate hai
 Their lifestyle may also be different
 lekin, vahi subjiyan donon ke gharon ke pakati hai
 Now if you call yourself a government of the poor, then tell me what is better if the poor eat in the inflationary season

 The same was seen in the case of former AAP leader Ashutosh and Bollywood film producer Ashoke Pandit
 ashok pandit purv piem manmohan singh par bani film 'da exindental prime minister (the Accidental Prime Minister)' ke ko-produsar rah chuke hai
 When former AAP leader Ashutosh took a dig at the PM and the media, Ashok Pandit did not back down from making sharp comments on him and even called him 'crow'
 aapako yaad dilaanaa chahta hoon , kuch log aapako @arvindkejriwal kaa kauwa bhi kehete the ! https: / / t
 co / cxnwx7wpov Ashoke Pandit is recognized for making scathing comments on social media anyway
 purv aap netaa or patrkaar ashutosh ne apane twitor handle par medio par tanj kasate hue likhaa, 'jab media pradhanmantri kaa kabutar ho jaae to maan lijie ki desh sankat main he
 In this way, Ashok Pandit did not like this stance of Ashutosh and he responded to his tweet on Twitter in a more sharp manner
 ashok pandit (ashoke Pandit) ne apane twitor account par likhaah 'aapako yaad dilaanaa chahta hoon , kuch log aapako arvind kejariwal kaa kauwa bhi kehete the!' is tarah unhone turant unhen riplai kar diya
 Ashutosh has lived in the AAP but after some time he left the party, and now he is back in journalism
 lekin ashok pandit ko twitor par kaaphi active dekha jaataa he or ve tikhe tanj kasne main peeche nahin rahete hai

 3
 haj karne vaale log kaaba ke purvi kone par jade hue ek kaale pathar ke darshan ko pavitra maanate hai
 It is said about this stone that it was a Shivling
 jo islam ke vahaan aane se purana he
 However, Muslims believe that this stone was sent from Jannat with Adam and Eve
 is pathar ke aasapaas ab chaandi kii freming kar di gai he
 Just like Jaladhari is around many Shivling

 kisi hindu puja ke dauraan bina sila hua vastra yaa dhoti pahante hai, usee tarah haj ke dauraan bhi bina sila hua safed sooti kapadaa hi pahana jaataa he
 This tradition continues before the arrival of Islam
 sirf yahi nahin, hajaaron tark-kutark hai
 The website is full of blogs
 yah daawa karne ke liye ki islam kii utpatti hindu dharm se hi hui he
 And it is equally answered that Islam came from heaven with Adam
 pataa nahin, is bahes main koi jeet bhi gaya to hasil kya hoga? BSP supremo Mayawati on Saturday targeted Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath over 'ali' and 'bajrangbali', saying that Yogi's party would neither get 'ali' nor 'bajrangbali' votes

 He said that in this regard i want to tell him (yogi) that we have Ali as well as Bajrangbali
 hamaare liye donon apane hi hai
 No one is non, so we need Ali and Bajrangbali too
 basapa supremeo ne kaha ki khaskar hamen bajrangbali isliye bhi chahie kyonki vah meri apni khud kii dalit jati se hi jude hai or inaki jati kii khoj maine nahin balki khud uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi ne kii he or inhone hi khud janata ko ye bataaya he ki bajrangbali vanavaasi or dalit jati ke hi hai
 The BSP chief said that and therefore i am also very grateful to him (yogi) that he has given us very special information about our descendants
 aisi sthiti main hamaare liye khushi kii baat ye he ki ab hamaare paas ali bhi hai or bajrangbali bhi hai jinke gathjod se is chunaav main hamen kaaphi acha parinaam milane vaala he
 Significantly, Mayawati a few days ago in Deoband of Saharanpur, appealed to the Muslims to unite and vote in favor of the alliance
 iske do din baad yogi ne meerut main ek sabha main sapa-basapa gathbandhan par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha tha ki inhen ali par bharosa he to hamen apane bajrangwali par bharosa he

 nachiketa se jab maine poocha ki 'unhone aapako kitni buree tarah pratadit kiya?' to vah thodi der to chup rahe, neeche dekha or phir sidhe meri ankhon main dekhte hue kehete hai, 'vah torchar kaaphi bura tha
 There comes a time when you think that 'death is easy', but i was lucky, the last part of the torture which is third degree was not started on me
 ' yah sab bataate hue unki aawaaj thodi kaanp jaati he
 During the Kargil War in 1999, a 26-year-old fighter pilot
 nachiketa ko kargil main 17,000 feet se zyada oonchai par sthit pakistani chaukiyon ko tabah karne kii jimmedaari di gai thi
 They hit the target and fired a powerful shot from their bomber aircraft mig 27, but only then did they face a situation that is a bad dream for any pilot
 unke ingine main 'aag lag gai' or phir vah bich aasmaan main hi band ho gaya
 In such a situation, he had only one goal - 'restart the engine'
 unke mig 27 main lage tumaanski terbo jet ingine main tab kuch jaan baaki thi or vah phir se chalane laga
 Pilots call it 're-light'
 haalanki yuddh kshetra se safaltaapurvak baahar nikalne kii jo ummid isse jaagi thi, vah utani hi jaldi dhoomil ho gai
 The engine had not yet reached its full potential and the hills started coming very fast
 vah khatre se baahar nikalne ke liye teji se upar bhi nahin uth sakate the
 He says, 'so my' re-light 'worked, but somewhere in the middle i had to eject from the plane, because i had reached very close to the ground
 or tabhi main iject kar gaya
 ' is ghatana ko yaad karte hue vah bataate he, 'ijection ke dauraan kuch der ke liye aanshik taur par behosh jaisaa tha, lekin main pakke taur par avgat tha ki vahaan kya ho rahaa he
 i reached the ground fairly soon
 vah bahut neeche se kiya gaya ijection tha
 The white sheet of snow was spread everywhere around where i landed
 us jagah par goliyaan baras rahi thi, jisase ijection ke jatke ke baad mujhe turant hosh aayaa or meraa aglaa lakshya khud ko cover karnaa tha
 ' iske kareeb aadhe ghante baad pakistani sainikon ne un par ghaat lagaakar hamalaa kiya, haalanki isse pehle nachiketa un par goliyon kii apni magazine khaali kar chuke the
 He says, 'we keep a small pistol for protection
 main dekh saktaa tha ki jahaan maine cover le rakhaa tha, vahaan paanch-chah log (mujh par) ghaat lagaae hai
 i fired the first shot
 or iske baad maine unhen rokane kii koshish main sari goliyaan daag di, taaki vah mere paas nahin aaen
 Unfortunately, our pistol range was just 25 yards, while they had AK-56
 isliye, pakkaa tha ki unki goliyaan to mujh par baras rahi hai, lekin meri goliyaan un tak nahin pahunch paa raheen or isse pehle kii main duusari magazine bharta, vah aae or mujhe bandhak bana liya
 ' nachiketa ko bandhak banane vaale pakistan ke nardan lite inphantry ke sainik behad krur the or unhen tab buree tarah peetate rahe, jab unke ek varisht adhikari ne unhen peeche hatane ko nahin kaha
 Nachiketa says, "the men holding me were banging with me and perhaps they intended to kill me, because for them i was just an enemy pilot firing bullets from the sky at their hideout
" khushkismati se, vahaan aayaa adhikari behad maior tha
 He understood the situation that i am now his hostage and now i do not need to be treated like that
 to unase un logon ko roka, jisamen kaaphi koshish lagi, lekin ve log us vakt kaaphi ugr the
 'nachiketa's picture a day before Pakistan was taken hostage nachiketa ko phir pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir le jaaya gaya, antarrashtriya media ke saamne khadaa kiya gaya or phir soochnaaon ke liye maaraa-peeta gaya
 However, Nachiketa had no idea of the efforts being made for his release
 vah kehete hai, 'poochtacha shuru ho chuki thi or mujhe pataa tha ki shaayad main kal naa dekh paaun
 However, there was always an expectation that someday i could return
 mujhe torchar kiya gaya
 Frankly, i was not the source of real information for them
 mujhe pataa tha ki ve mujhe kuch aisa jaananaa chaahate the, jisase unhen madad mili
 But there was one thing that being an Air Force pilot, i did not have information about the Army's plan
 ' After backdoor attempts by the Indian government to release Nachiketa, he was handed over to the Red Cross 8 days after being held hostage, which brought him back to India
 yahaan raashtrapati keaar narayanan or pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne unka hero jaisaa swaagat kiya
 The comments zyaadaatar logon ke liye ye anubhav kaam chhodane ke liye kaaphi hota, lekin nachiketa alag hi mitti ke bane the
 Due to a back injury sustained during the ejection in Kargil, he could not return to the forward plane
 haalanki nachi, jaisaa ki dost unhen pukaarte hai, bhartiya vayusena ke transport flit main shaamil hue or vishaal Il-76 trassport vimaan udaate hai
 Nachchi, 17 years after Kargil, says, 'the heart of a pilot is always in the cockpit
 '(hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) 1999 main kargil yuddh ke dauraan 26 varshiya fiter payalat ke
 Nachiketa was given the responsibility to destroy the Pakistani posts at an altitude of more than 17,000 feet in Kargil
 unhone lakshya ko nishane par liya or apane bamavarshak vimaan mig 27 se ek shaktishaalee gola daaga, lekin tabhi unhen aise halaat kaa saamana padaa, jo ki kisi bhi payalat ke liye bure khwab jaisaa hota he
 His engine 'caught fire' and then it stopped in the middle of the sky
 aise main unka bas ek hi lakshya tha- 'ingine ko dobaaraa shuru karnaa'
 The Tumanski turbo jet engine fitted to their mig 27 then had some life left and it started running again
 payalat ise 'ri-lite' kehete hai
 However, the hope of successfully getting out of the war zone was tarnished by that
 ingine ab tak apni puri kshamta par bhi nahin pahunchaa tha or saamne behad teji se pahadiyaan aane lageen
 He could not even rise fast to get out of danger
 vah kehete hai, 'to meraa 'ri-lite' kargar rahaa, lekin bich main hi kahin par mujhe vimaan se iject karnaa padaa, kyonki main jameen ke behad kareeb pahunch chukaa tha
 And then i was ejected
 ' Recalling the incident, he recounts, 'during the ejection, i was partially unconscious for a while, but i was firmly aware of what was happening there
 main kaaphi jaldi hi jameen par pahunch gaya
 It was a very low ejection
 jahaan par main utraa vahaan chaaron taraf barf kii safed chadar faili thi
 There was bulging at that place, which immediately made me conscious after the ejection shock and my next goal was to cover myself
 ' About half an hour later, Pakistani soldiers ambushed him, although before that Nachiketa had emptied his magazine of bullets on him
 vah kehete hai, 'ham hifaazat ke liye ek choti pistal rakhte hai
 i could see that where i had taken cover, five-six people (on me) have been ambushed
 maine pehali goli daagi
 And after that, i tried to stop them by firing all the bullets so that they would not come to me
 badakismati se hamaari pistal kaa range mahaj 25 yard tha, jabaki unke paas AK-56 thi
 So, he was sure that his bullets were raining on me, but my bullets could not reach him and before i filled the second magazine, he came and took me hostage
 ' The soldiers of the Northern Light Infantry of Pakistan, who held Nachiketa hostage, were extremely cruel and beat him up badly when a senior officer asked him not to retreat
 nachiketa bataate hai, 'mujhe pakadney vaale jawan mere saath dhakkamukki kar rahe the or shaayad unka iraadaa mujhe maarane kaa tha, kyonki unke liye main bas ek dushman payalat tha, jo unke thikaane par aasmaan se goliyaan barasaa rahaa tha
 Luckily, the officer who came there was extremely mature
 usne halaat ko samajha ki main ab unka bandhak hum or ab mujhase vaise bartaav kii jarurat nahin
 So they stopped those people, which took a lot of effort, but those people were very fierce at that time
 'pakistan dwaara bandhak banaae jane se ek din pehle kii nachiketa kii tasviir Nachiketa was then taken to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, posed in front of international media and then beaten for information
 haalanki nachiketa ko unki rihaai ke liye kiye ja rahe prayaason ko koi andaja nahin tha
 He says, "the questioning had begun and i knew that i might not be able to see tomorrow
" haalanki is bich hameshaa ek ummid to thi ki kisi din main waapas laut sakuunga
 i was tortured
 saaf kahuun to main unke liye asal soochna ko strot nahin tha
 i knew they wanted me to know something that would help them
 lekin ek cheez thi ki air force payalat hone ke naate, mere paas sena kii yojana kii jaankaree nahin thi
 ' nachiketa kii rihaai ke liye bharat sarkaar kii ore se balldor koshishon ke baad unhen bandhak banaae jane ke 8 dinon baad red cross ke hawaale kar diya gaya, jo ki unhen bharat waapas lekar ai
 Here President KR Narayanan and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee welcomed him like a hero
 tippaniyan For most people, this experience would have been enough to leave work, but Nachiketa was made of different clay
 kargil main ijection ke dauraan peeth main lagi chot ke kaaran vah aage fiter plane main to vah vaapasi nahin kar sake
 However Nachy, as friends call him, joined the Indian Air Force's Transport Fleet and flew a huge Il-76 transport aircraft
