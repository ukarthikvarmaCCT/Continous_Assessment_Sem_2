 Jailani's claim of 23rd day of hearing in the Constitution Bench of SC in Ayodhya Ram Janmabhoomi case - Ram Nath statue was kept inside the mosque on the night of 22-23 December 1949 at Babri Masjid between 1934 and 1949 - Claim Supreme in Ayodhya Ram Janmabhoomi case The hearing in the constitution bench of the court continues
 muslim paksh kii taraf se duusare vakil jafarayab jilani ne shuukravaar ko dastavejon ke jariye yah sabit karne kii koshish kii ki 1934 se 1949 ke bich bhi babari masjid main niyamit namaaj hoti thi
 So, on behalf of another Muslim side, senior advocate Rajiv Dhawan said that Hindus used to worship in the outside compound, but on the night of 22-23 December 1949, the idol of Ramlala was illegally shifted inside the mosque
 ram janmabhumi maamle main supreme court kii samvidhan peeth main 23wein din kii sunwaayee ke dauraan muslim paksh kii taraf se duusare vakil jafarayab jilani ne bahes kii shuruyaat karte hue kaha ki 1885 main nirmohi akhaada ne jab court main yachika daayar kii thi to unhone apni yachika main vivaadit jameen ke pashchimi seemaa par masjid hone kii baat kahi thi
 This part is now known as the inner courtyard of the disputed land
 '1934 se 1949 ke bich niyamit namaaj'nirmohi akhaada ne 1942 ke apane mukademe main bhi masjid kaa zikr kiya he jisamen unhone teen gumbad vaale dhaanche ko masjid sweekaar kiya tha
 Senior lawyer Zafaryab Jilani is trying to prove through these documents that between 1934 and 1949 there were regular prayers in Babri Masjid
 haalanki peeth ke samaksh vakil jilani ne kaha ki roj kii namaaj ke liye zyada log nahin aate the, lekin jume kii namaaj main bheed hoti thi
 The statements of many people are recorded in the lower courts, who used to come to the birthplace mosque here from Faizabad to offer prayers
 1949 main namaaj padhane vaale logajafarayab jilani kii daleel thi ki jo dastavej nirmohi akhaade ne pesh kiye hai, unase saaf he ki vahaan masjid thi lekin iske baad bhi yah kaise kah sakate hai vahaan par namaaj nahin padhi jaati thi
 He quoted Mohammad Hashim's statement that Hashim had said in his statement that he had offered namaz at the Babri Masjid on 22 December 1949
 jafarayab jilani ne haji mehboob ke bayaan kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki 22 november 1949 ko unhone babari masjid main namaaj adaa kii thi
 Jilani said about a witness that in 1954, the person was imprisoned for trying to offer prayers in Babri Masjid
 jafarayab jilani ne babari masjid main 1945-46 main taraavih kii namaaj padhaane vaale hafiz ke bayaan kaa bhi zikr kiya
 He cited the statement of a witness that he had offered the prayers of Maghrib in 1939 at Babri Masjid
 muslim paksh kii taraf se paksh rakh rahe jafarayab jilani muslim paksh ke gavaahon ke bayaan par yah sabit karne kii koshish kar rahe he ki 1934 ke baad bhi vivaadit sthal par namaaj padhi gai
 Earlier, during the arguments in the Supreme Court on behalf of the Hindu side, it was argued that after 1934, Namaz was not read at the disputed site
 'nirmohi akhaade shabiyat'muslim paksh kii taraf se varisht vakil rajeev dhawan ne muslim pakshakaron main se hi ek or ke liye apni daleelein shuru kii
 Dhawan said that the Nirmohi Arena has filed a petition for the right to the inside yard, only for the charge and management
 unhone aage kaha ki pehle hindu baahar ke ahaate main puja karte the, lekin 22-23 disambar 1949 kii raat ramalala kii murti ko avaidh tareeke se masjid ke andar shift kar diya gaya
 Dhawan said that the Nirmohi Akhara says that it is Shebiyot
 philhal akhaada management ke adhikaar se vanchit he, lekin agar koi nayaa mandir ban jaataa he to nirmohi akhaada uskaa shabiyat rahegaa
 Rajiv Dhawan said that the trial of Mahant Raghubar Das in 1885 was first denied by the Nirmohi Akhara, but was later considered the Mahant of the Nirmohi Arena
 isi tarah pehle nirmohi akhaada ne janmasthan shabd ko nakaar diya tha lekin baad main isko jeudicial intry main mana
 The hearing will continue on Monday, Rajiv Dhawan also questioned the argument of considering the place as a juristic person
 unka tark he ki hindu paksh ne tark diya he ki yahaan to nadiyon, pahaado, kunon ke liye prarthana kii jaati he, meraa tark he ki ye ek vaidic abhyaas he
 As far as the Vedas are concerned, they worship it but not in this form
 aap surya se prarthana karte hai, lekin ise apana adhikaar kshetra nahin kehete
 He said that the concept of a self-proclaimed being is that God reflects himself, like a mountain or a Manasarovar, this does not prove that such a self-proclaimed God forms the juristic personality
 ayodhya ram janmabhumi maamle kii sunwaayee somvaar ko bhi jari rahegi
 Rajiv Dhawan will be on the Muslim side

 The Kargil War of 1999 was due to this infiltration

 The year 1987, the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was walking with the image of Mr
 Clean
 tabhi boforce topon kii kharid main dallali kaa maamla uchhla, bhrashtachar ke is mudde par vipakshi ekta ne rajeev gandhi or unki sarkaar par tabadatod hamale kiye
 By 1989, Bofors became a major electoral issue and the Rajiv government lost
 ab tees saal baad congress isi hathiyaar se itihaas ko dohraane kii koshish main he
 Yes, the difference is that this time, Rajiv Gandhi's son and Congress President Rahul Gandhi is planning a strategy to take out the opposition and take Prime Minister Narendra Modi out of power in 2019
 vaise is baar bhi sauda raksha kaa hi he or wo he rafel
 Congress MP from Rajya Sabha PL Punia believes that Bofors was a fake issue, which was rejected in the Court of Law
 asli ghotaalaa to rafel he, jisamen sab shishe kii tarah saaf he ki, kaise keemat badhaai gai or kaise ek udyogpati ko phayda diya gaya
 Rafale deal will be the main issue in 2019 elections
 gauratlab he ki pehle rahul gandhi ne apni reliyon main lagaataar is mudde ko uthaaya, congress ne baar baar press conference kar masale ko banaae rakhaa
 Speaking on the no-confidence motion against the Modi government, Rahul raised the Rafale issue with full force on the floor of the House in the presence of the PM
 maamla shant na hone paae isliye do din baad hi purv raksha mantri eke antni ne badi press conference karke rahul ke aaropon ko or aage badhaayaa
 After this, in a party meeting, Rahul himself told his leaders that, continue to be the issues on which you face the media in the states
 lekin saath hi rafel jaise bade rashtriya masale par bhi saral shabdon main media ko bataaen
 After this, the Congress Media Department and Social Media Department have devised their strategy to make this issue public
 iske tahtarahul ke rafelpar lagaaye gayi aaropon vaale bayaan kii choti choti clip banaakar viral kii gayi
 In the future too, there is a preparation to distribute it in different languages by distributing small pamphlets
 is puri kavayad main is baat kaa khaas khyal rakhaa ja rahaa he ki, aasaan bhashaa janata main bharosa paidaa karne vaali or aakarshak ho
 As part of the strategy, three points of Rahul's allegations are to be particularly highlighted: 1
 upie sarkaar ke dauraan jo ladaaku vimaan 520 karod kaa tha, wo modi sarkaar teen guna keemat 1670 karod rupaye main kyon kharid rahi he?2
 The UPA gave the task of maintenance and future production to the government company Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, which was given by the Modi government to a private company with no experience in making fighter aircraft
 3
 The scandal occurred in the defense deal related to the security of the country
 congress ko shaayad yaad he ki, boforce ke vaqt 64 karod kii dallali kaa aankada vipaksh ne baar-baar aise hi uchhaala jo sabaki jubaan par chadh gaya
 On some similar lines, the Congress will also make the data an electoral issue in a simple and straightforward manner
 mudda khatm naa ho iske liye rahul , baaki netaa or congress, vipaksh ko saath lekar aage bhi is mudde ko nae-nae tareeke se uthaate rahenge
 As part of this strategy, the Congress is preparing to bring a motion for breach of privilege in the Lok Sabha by accusing the PM and the Defense Minister of misrepresentation on the issue
 vahiin kabhi upie sarkaar kii dhuravirohi rahi aam aadmi party bhi is muhim main congress ke saath khadi he, party ke rajya sabha saansad sanjay singh bhi is mudde par rajya sabha main piem modi ko gher rahe hai
 Overall, in 1989, the opposition made a defense deal against the Congress by arming it and bringing it to the political floor, just like now the Congress wants to repeat the history of politics through a defense deal with the opposition

 In New Delhi on Monday, the BJP issued its announcement in the presence of almost all senior leaders
 is ahm dastavej main ram mandir kii vaapasi se congress or sipiem bhadak gaye hai
 However, Congress leader Digvijay Singh definitely said that if a party like BJP has spoken of helping Madrasas, then it is a good sign for democracy
 madrason kii madad ke vaade se digvijay khush!digvijay ne ram mandir ke mudde par bijepi ko aade haathon liya
 He said, 'I knew that these people had no allegiance to Ram
 keval ram ke naam kaa prachaar kiya or uskaa raajnneetik upyog kiya
 Digvijay, referring to the sting of the recent Cobra Post, said, 'you will see the sting of the Cobra Post, so VHP leaders are saying that unless some Hindus die, the movement will not die
 2004 main inhone kaha tha ki vishaal mandir banaaya jayega, phir baat kerani chhod di
 But i am happy that even a party like BJP is talking about help to madrasas, so it is auspicious sign for the country
 'BJP ne kah diya atal ko alavida: jdukabi bijepi kii sahyogi rahi jediu ne bhi 'hindutv hardline' ke muddon ko ghoshnaa patr main shaamil karne kii ninda kii he
 JDU general secretary KC Tyagi said, 'today is the day to end the Atal era
 ab se 16 saal pehle unhone desh se vaayada kiya tha ki jo vivaadit mudde hai, masalan, ram janmabhumi vivaad, dhara 370, uniform civil code, unhen menifesto main nahin rakhenge
 But BJP again added these issues and said goodbye to Atal
 is ghoshnaptr main bihar ko vishesh darje kaa koi zikr nahin he
 'his real face revealed: CPI Left Party CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta said that by adding Ram temple issue in this manifesto, BJP has shown its true colors
 unhone kaha, 'wo apana hindu vot majboot karnaa chaahate hai
 But this is their communal face
 ye ek chetavanee he un logon ke liye, jo sochate hai ki narendra modi majboot netaa hai or desh chalaa sakate hai
 Congress leader Rashid Alvi said that if the BJP is talking about the temple as per the constitution, then to whom is it denied
 phir vah 20 saal se kis baat kaa jhagada kar rahe hai
 BJP should tell whether the constitution allows the temple to be built by breaking the mosque? 'we will build temples, will not tell the date' Mayawati's party has also opposed making Ram temple an election issue
 party netaa sudhindra bhadauria ne bijepi par tanj karte hue kaha, 'isamen bhi kah rahe hai ki ham ram mandir banaaenge, par logon se baatcheet karne ke baad
 Those old people know that the same slogan is that we will come to Ramlala, we will build the temple there itself
 par taarikh nahin bataaenge

 The incident took place when Tejashwi Yadav was exiting the cabinet meeting
 sachivalay main hi tejasvi yadav ne media se baat kii
 Mediamen were constantly questioning Tejashwi Yadav to demand bjp's resignation
 isi dauraan tejasvi yadav ke suraksha guard or samarthak bhadak uthe or mediakarmiyon se hathapayee karne lage
 Before this fight Hitejsvi expressed his anger to the media
 unhone kaha tha ki media kaa ek tabaka modi parast he or gunda he
 Before this ruckus, Bihar Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav, who was engulfed in the railway tender scam, first spoke fiercely in his defense and also on the opponents
 tejasvi yadav cabinet kii baithak ke baad baahar nikle the
 Even before the cabinet, the media surrounded him with questions, but then he quietly went inside

 58 lakh crore is being estimated

 The central government is also giving priority to this merger plan for public sector banks under the burden of npas because all four banks have been going through losses
 marjar ke baad nae bank main sabase kamjor kadi apni sampatti aasaani se bech sakegi or ghate kii bharpai kii prakriya ko shuru kar sakegi
 In addition, the weaker bank will be able to easily decide to close the branches where it has suffered the most losses to reduce its operating losses

 rekha ne ye rakam apni saansad-nidhi se die jane kii sanstuti di he
 This amount will be given to Kishori Raman Balika Inter College in Mathura and Kasturba Gandhi Girls Inter College in Naujheel area

 iskaa istemaldonon collejonki boundry wal banane, svachh peya jal ke liye aaro lagavane samet vikaas kaaryon par kharch kiya jayega
 Significantly, the Mathura Lok Sabha seat in Parliament is represented by the country's famous actress Hema Malini
 hema malini saal 2014 main yahaan se bijepi ke tikat par chunaav bhi jiti hai
 The first one month of Aam Aadmi Party has been completed in Delhi but Kejriwal government has not approved any major project during this period
 darasal 10 karod se zyaada bajet vaale kisi bhi project ko manjuuri dene ke liye vyay evam vitt samiti yani iefasi kii meeting kerani hoti he, jisaki adhyakshata vitt mantri karte hai
 If the cost of a project is more than 50 crores, then it is necessary to bring it to the EFC headed by the Chief Minister
 lekin kejariwal sarkaar ke pehle ek maheene main is cameti kii koi bhi meeting nahin hui lihaaja 10 karod se zyaada laagat vaali ek bhi yojana paas nahin kii gai
 Significantly, on Thursday, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has called a meeting of the new Chief Secretary KK Sharma and the head of all the departments of Delhi Government
 is meeting main pichley ek maheene ke kaamkaaj kii samiksha kii jaani he
 Last year, when the President's rule was imposed in Delhi, there were three meetings of the EFC in Delhi, in which the plan for the new building of several schools was also passed
 nae project ko paas karwaanaa is lihaaj se bhi jaruri he kyonki aam aadmi party ne agle 5 saalon main 500 nae skool, 20 nae college banane kaa vaayada kiya tha
 Apart from this, tender of new 1500 buses has also been stuck in Delhi for the last two years
 ise bhi jald se jald manjuur kiya janaa jaruri he
 Since assuming the throne of the Chief Minister, AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal has suffered three major setbacks
 1
 Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav are in a mutual feud between the Aam Aadmi Party ousted from the PAC, revealing the difference
 party ke chaahane waalon ke yah bahut bada jhatka sabit hua jab iske sansthaapak sadasyon prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav ko vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan party virdohi gatividhiyon main shaamil hone kaa aarope lagaakar rashtriya kaaryakarini (piesi) se nikaal diya gaya
 What was then, AAP leaders openly expressed anger
 manaahi ke baavjood party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini ke byore ko mayank gandhi ne apane blog ke jariye saarvajanik kiya or ashish khetaan samet kuch anya netaaon par nishaanaa saadhaa
 In this, he blamed Arvind Kejriwal for ousting Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan from the PAC
 iske baad unka ek or blog aayaa or isamen unhone likhaa ki pehla blog likhane ke baad unhen apamaanit kiya ja rahaa he
 He also stated that he was also excluded from the BBM (blackberry Messenger) group
 is blog ke jariye unhone ashanka jataai ki unhen apamaanit karke party se nikaal diya jayega
 a lengthy letter was also issued by Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav in which both of them gave shocking statements on many allegations made against them
 unhone likhaa he, 'ham donon ne kisi bhi aupchaarik yaa anaupchaarik baithak main kejariwal ko sanyojak pad se hataane kaa koi zikr nahin kiya
 2
 sting oparationparty ke purv vidhayak rajesh garg ne kathith taur par arvind kejariwal kaa ek audio clip jari karte hue yah daawa kiya ki 2013 main chunaav jeetne ke baad apni 49 dinon kii sarkaar ko bachaane ke liye arvind kejariwal or unke kareebi netaaon ne congress ke vidhayakon ko kharidne kii koshish kii thi
 3
 anjali damania ne party se istipha diyasting oparation ke saamne aate hi aap kaaryakarta anjali damania ne party se istipha de diya
 He took to Twitter to submit his resignation
 damania ne apane twit main likhaa, 'main party chhod rahi hum
 The Aam Aadmi party did not come for the nonsense
 siddhanton ke liye arvind kejariwal ke saath thi
 Not for the purchase of mlas
 ' The ruling CPI (M) government in Tripura for 25 years suffered a crushing defeat in the assembly elections
 jahaan beete 5 chunaavon ke baad sipiai(em) ne lagaataar rajya main sarkaar banaai, vahiin is baar kendra main sattarudh bijepi ne use patkhni dete hue apane liye do-tihaai bahumat kaa rasta saaf kar liya he
 After this result in the elections, it is clear that the bjp's strategy has proved more effective than the ruling Left and the people of the state preferred the bjp's slogan of change, denying the popularity of Chief Minister Manik Sarkar
 jaane bijepi kii vah ranneeti jisane dilaa di ye apratyaashit jeet
 
 
 In order to demolish this stronghold of 42 thousand Panna Pramukh Left Party, BJP had planned a strategy to deploy one Panna Pramukh per 60 voters
 gauratlab he ki 2017 main uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaavon main panna pramukhon kii ranneeti safal hone ke baad party ne tripura main bhi kul 42 hajaar panna pramukh niyukt kiye
 These Panna Pramukhs were given the responsibility of helping 60 voters who came to their side
 panna pramukhon ko votaron se sidhaa sampark saadhane ke saath-saath kendra sarkaar kii nitiyon kaa prachaar karnaa or voting ke din yah sunishchit karnaa tha ki sabhi voter apana vot daalane ke liye poling booth tak pahunche
 There are 23 officials in Tripura for 500 days
 In the North East, the party worked on the strategy of about 23 office bearers to visit the electoral states in the course of the last two years to contest the regional parties including the Left and the Congress
 is dauraan party ke sheersh netaaon or anya cell ke kaamkaaj dekhne vaale padaadhikariyon ko teenon rajyon main kendra sarkaar ke kaamkaaj or uplabdhiyon kaa prachaar karne kii jimmedaari di thi
 For this unexpected victory in Hatripura, Deodhar has played an important role for BJP leader Sunil Deodhar, who had trained with the RSS
 mumbai se aane vaale devdhar ne tripura main party ke liye baaji palatney kaa apana kaam lagbhag 2 saal pehle shuru kar diya tha
 Deodhar was appointed in charge of Tripura by the BJP before the elections
 gauratlab he ki 2014 ke aam chunaavon main devdhar ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke campagne manager kii ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 After being appointed in-charge of Tripura, Deodhar ran the 'modi Dyut Yojana' for campaigning in the state by BJP workers to convey the achievements of the Modi government in regional language
 ise padhein: purvottar kii raajnneeti ko badal denge teen rajyon ke aaj ke chunavi nattijeyhemanta vishwa sharma teen maheene serajya main cader yukt left party kaa saamana karne ke liye panna pramukhon kaa sahaara lene ke saath-saath bijepi ne tripura jeetne kii jimmedaari assam ke vitt mantri hemanta vishwa sharma ko saunpi
 Hemanta Sharma encamped in Tripura to determine the bjp's victory from January 2018, even before the election bugle in the state
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle assam, arunachal or manipur main bijepi sarkaar kaa gathan karaane main bhi hemanta sharma kii behad ahm bhoomika rahi he
 Ram Madhav's leadership was led by Ram Madhav commanding the election campaign of all the three states in the Northeast including Tripura
 bataur party ke north-east incharge sabhi chunavi rajyon ke prabhariyon ke saath ram madhav beete kai maheenon se lagaataar kaam kar rahe the
 Especially on the initiative of Ram Madhav in Tripura, the strategy of declaring the authority of the state government as anti-development was worked out
 iske alaava ram madhav ke netritv main hi party ne rajya main tribal votaron ke bich party ko pahunchaate hue bijepi kii jeet ko tay kiya
 In the last four years, the BJP did not just organize the party organizationally to compete against the leftist parties with cadres visiting dozens of ministers
 bijepi ne rajya ke chunaavon ke liye pradhanmantri kii do ahm reliyon ke saath-saath kendra sarkaar ke darjanon mantriyon ko prachaar main utaarne kaa kaam kiya
 It is worth noting that during the last four years of tenure, BJP has continuously sent central ministers to the state so that when the time comes, it can present the party as a stronger alternative than the state government
 kendriya mantriyon ke in daure main kendra sarkaar kii yojanaon kaa jamkar prachaar kiya gaya or rajya kii janata ke saamne saaf taur par daleel di gai ki maanik sarkaar ne sirf rajya ko vikaas se dur rakhane kaa kaam kiya he
 Assam was at the center of this spectacular victory of BJP in Milapura supporttripura from Guwahati headquarters, Assam
 beete saal assam main sarkaar banane ke baad se lagaataar bijepi ne purvottar ke anya rajyon main apni paith banane ke liye guwahati ko purvottar main apni raajnneetik gatividhiyon kaa kendra banaaya
 Along with handing over the victory to Assam Finance Minister Hemanta Vishwa Sharma, Tripura incharge Sunil Deodhar was also asked to camp in Guwahati
 haalanki chunaavon ke liye purvottar ke anya donon rajya nagaland or meghalaya ke liye bhi guwahati ko kendra main rakhaa gaya
 Sushma Swaraj helped Lalit Modi get Portugal visa
 kaha ja rahaa he ki yah maanavtaa ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he, kyonki lalit modi kii patni ko cancer he or unka vahaan ilaaj hona tha
 For this, Sushma spoke to the British MP Keith Vaz and the High Commissioner there and said that the Government of India had no objection in giving travel visa to Lalit Modi
 isi baat par ab bavaal machaa he ki lalit modi jo 2010 main hi bharat chhod chuke hai or un par kareeb 500 karod rupee kii hera pheri kaa aarope he
 Along with this, the ED has sent a notice to them
 lalit modi jaanch se bachane ke liye england se bharat nahin aa rahe hai
 This is where the BCCI comes in this picture
 cricket board main netaaon kaa dakhal se sabhi waakif hai
 This is the reason that Kirti Azad openly came to Sushma's thought and tweeted that who is the snake of the sleeve in BJP! baat ishaaron ishaaron main ho rahi he
 Everyone knows who removed Kirti Azad from Delhi Cricket Association and till now their board in Bihar has not yet been recognized by the BCCI
 kirti aaazaad ne arun jetali ke khilaaf morcha kholaa hua he
 Lalit Modi was once a BCCI lover and credit for giving birth to the IPL or his success at this huge level has also been given to Lalit Modi
 haalanki ipel kaa vaastavik idia madhav raav sindhiya kaa tha
 But when Lalit Modi's relationship with the Cricket Board of India deteriorated, everyone turned his eyes to Lalit Modi
 kehane vaale yah bhi kehete hai ki shrinivasana ke khilaaf supreme court main jo mukadmaa chalaa he or usamen jo bade nami-giraami vakil pesh ho rahe hai, uske peeche bhi lalit modi hi hai
 This time, Sharad Pawar could not contest the cricket board because he did not trust the support of Jaitley Camp
 tippaniyan This episode has also opened up the infighting of BJP
 ab jaraa dekhie sushamaa ke vachaav main sabase pehle aae rajnath singh or khud bijepi adhyaksh amit shah
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also been the President of Gujarat Cricket Association at one time and now Amit Shah is its President
 shah ko pataa he ki yah keval sushamaa par hamalaa nahin, nishane par pradhanmantri bhi honge, kyonki videsh mantralay main pradhanmantri karyaalay kii bahut chalati he
 The key here is not who is behind this dispute
 ahm yah he ki kisi bhagode kii maanviya aadhaar par madad karnaa kitna sahi he
 It would have been nice had Lalit Modi been asked to surrender and the investigative agencies would have been asked to cooperate and would have been helped on humanitarian grounds

 yaheen par hi bisisiai is tasviir main aati he
 All are aware of the interference of the leaders in the cricket board
 yahi vajah he ki kirti aaazaad khul kar sushamaa ke vachaav main aa gaye or twit kiya ki bijepi main koun he aasteen kaa saanp! It is happening in gesture gestures
 sabko pataa he ki kirti aaazaad ko dilli cricket sangh se kisne nikaala or abhi tak bihar main unke board ko bisisiai ne abhi tak manyata nahin di he
 Kirti Azad has opened the front against Arun Jaitley
 lalit modi ek vakt main bisisiai ke laadle hua karte the or ipel ko janm dene yaa is viraat str par uski safalataa kaa shrey bhi lalit modi ko diya jaataa rahaa he
 However, the real idea of IPL was that of Madhav Rao Scindia
 magar jab lalit modi ke rishte bhartiya cricket board se kharaab hue, to sabhi ne lalit modi se ankhe mode lee
 The sayers also say that Lalit Modi is also behind the lawsuit against Srinivasan in the Supreme Court and the prominent lawyers appearing in it
 is baar cricket board kaa chunaav sharad pavaar isliye nahin lard paae kyonki unhen jetali camp ke sarmathan kaa bharosa nahin tha
 The comments is prakaran ne bijepi ke andruni kalah kii kalai bhi khol di he
 Now look at Rajnath Singh and Sushma's first BJP president Amit Shah
 ek vakt main pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi gujarat cricket sangh ke adhyaksh rah chuke hai or ab amit shah iske adhyaksh he
 Shah is aware that it will not only be an attack on Sushma, but will also be the prime minister on target, as the Prime Minister's Office runs a lot in the Ministry of External Affairs
 yahaan ahm yah nahin he ki is vivaad ke peeche koun he
 The important thing is how right it is to help a fugitive on humanitarian grounds
 acha hota lalit modi ko aatmasamarpan karne ke liye kaha jaataa or jaanch agenciyon se sahyog karne ke liye kaha jaataa or tab maanviya aadhaar par unki madad kii jaati

 chhattisgarh main mantri banane ko lekar congress ke bheetar ghamaasan jari he
 Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel's trouble is increasing after he refused to give the ministerial berth to senior legislators
 party ke bheetar aadha darjan se zyada aise netaaon kaa dabaav ban gaya he, jinhen mantri pad se nawaja nahin gaya he
 Therefore, to satisfy such leaders, Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and demanded an increase in the number of ministers
 unhone iske liye rajya kii bhugolic sthiti or kshetrafal kaa hawala dete hue kul vidhayakon kii sankhya ke 15 fisadi kii bajaae 20 fisadi mantri pad kiye jane kii maang kii he
 In fact, senior legislators and former ministers Satyanarayan Sharma, Amitesh Shukla and Dhanendra Sahu have not found a place in Bhupesh Baghel's cabinet
 varisht congressi netaa motilal vora ke vidhayak bete arun vora bhi mantrimandal main sthaan nahin milane se naaraaz hai
 The same is true of many leaders of scheduled castes and tribes
 party ke anusuchit janajati morche ke pradesh adhyaksh amarjit bhagat bhi mantri banane kii jodtod main lage rahe, lekin unhen maayusi haath lagi
 He has become the MLA for the third time, while the eight-time MLA and former minister Rampukar Singh has also been disappointed
 mantri nahin banane se wo itnaa naaraaz hue ki shapath grahan sthal se aadha adhuraa kaarykram chhod waapas laut gaye the
 Tribal leader and former minister Manoj Mandavi from Bastar is also dissatisfied with not becoming a minister
 soobe ke mukhyamantri bhupesh baghel ne pradhanmantri modi ko bheje gaye khat main kaha ki bharat ke samvidhan ke anuchhed 164 (1-k) main kisi rajya main mantri parishad main mukhyamantri sahit mantriyon kii sankhya 15 pratishat se adhik nahin hogi
 According to this provision, the number of ministers including the Chief Minister in Chhattisgarh cannot exceed 13
 unhone kaha ki chhattisgarh rajya kaa kshetrafal 1
 It is more than 3
5 million square kilometers and 4 of the total landmass of the nation
 4 pratishat he
 Along with this, the area of chhattisgarh state is more than Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Bihar and West Bengal
 chhattisgarhmen anusuchit janajati kii jansankhya 32 pratishat, anusuchit jati kii 12 pratishat or anya pichhadaa varg kii jansankhya lagbhag 45 pratishat he
 Keeping this in view, keeping in view the geographical area in the new state, it is necessary to increase the number of members of the Council of Ministers for the smooth functioning of governance
 mukhyamantri baghel ne in sabhi tathyon ke aadhaar par chhattisgarh rajya main mantriparishad ke sadasyon kii sankhya 15 pratishat ke sthaan 20 pratishat kiye jane ke liye samvidhan ke anuchhed 164 (1-k) ke praavdhaan main sanshodhan ke liye samuchit pahal karne kaa anurodh pradhanmantri se kiya he
 The Congress high command, trying to convince the disgruntled leaders, is engaged with the state in-charge PL Punia Jorshore to calm the ruckus within the Congress party
 unhone mantriyon ke tamaam daavedaaron ko anushaasan kaa danda dikhaate hue party forum main hi apni baat rakhane ke nirdesh die hai
 The disgruntled leaders have been assured to convene a meeting of the Congress Working Committee soon
 congress ne ranneetik taur par mantrimandal main ek sthaan rikt rakhaa he
 The party is sending a message to all the leaders that the best performing MLA in the Lok Sabha will be made a minister
 iske liye bhi yah sthaan rikt rakhaa gaya he
 The party fears that the dissatisfaction spread by not making a minister should not be overshadowed in the Lok Sabha elections
 iske chalate asantusht netaaon ko manaane ke liye party alaakaman ko kadi mashkkt kerani pad rahi he
 Delhi's Health Minister Satyendra Jain seems to have been greatly affected by the dengue-spread Aedes mosquito, which is why, then, he creates new analogues for the dengue mosquito
 mangalvaar ko jab vidhansabha main dengue or chikangunia par charchaa shuru hui, to jawaab satyendra jain kii taraf se aayaa
 He also emphasized the need to caution people by counting the features of mosquito out loud, rather than declaring governmental arrangements to prevent mosquito outbreak
 unhonedengue or chikanguniafailane vaale adies ko shahi machhar bataaya
 Also gave an interesting reason for this
 mantri jike mutabik dengue kaa machhar dabl shift main kaam nahin karata, matlab ye sirf din main katata he, raat ko nahin
 Works in daytime, not at night, according to the minister- Al is also more active during morning or evening
 unhone aadhi baanh kii shart pahanakar aaye apni party ke vidhayak madanlaal ko ye salaah bhi di ki wo ab se puri baanh kii shart pahana karen, kyonki isse dengue ke machhar ke kaatane kaa khatra kam ho jaataa he
 The first Aam Aadmi Party mlas pulled the MCD fiercely in the House over the rising cases of dengue and chikungunya
 ek ek karke tamaam vidhayakon ne aarope lagaaya ki emsidi na to sadakon kii safai thik se kar rahi he or na hi naaliyon main pani jamaa hone se roak paa rahi he, jisase machharon ko panpane kaa mauka mil rahaa he
 Said- More Panic being spread Even after talking to journalists, Satyendra Jain said that panic is being spread more due to dengue, while the reality is that dengue patient does not have to be admitted to hospital
 log tivi par dengue kii khabaren dekhte hai or darkar aspataal main pahunch jate hai
 While paracetamol is the only medicine for a dengue patient
 saath main use khub pani pinaa chahie or ghar par rahakar hi aaraam karnaa chahie

 The long struggle for independence generated thousands of millions of patriots
 aaazaad hawa main saans lene ke liye hajaaron-lakhon logon ne hansate-hansate apane praanon kii aahuti de di
 In order to salute these heroes and awaken independence among young people, many writers went to the streets
 lambey sangharsh ke baad jab desh aaazaad hua to ek se badhkar ek deshbhakti kii filmein baniin
 There were stories of freedom heroes, freedom struggle and dreams for a golden future
 aise vakt main jo deshbhakti ke gane bane wo logon ke dilon me lahar paidaa kar gaye
 If the first song of patriotic songs comes in anyone's mind, it is a song
 
 
 1
 'O people of my country, you cry a lot ye shubh din he ham sab kaa, laharaa lo tirangaa pyaara But don't forget at the border, the heroes lost their lives kuch yaad unhen bhi kar lo - 2 Who did not return home i mere vatan ke logon, jaraa aankh main bhar lo pani, Remember those who were martyred, just remember the sacrifice 2 ' kavi pradeep ke likhe is geet ko si
 Ramchandra composed and the voice of Kokila Lata Mangeshkar lent her voice
 is gane ko 27 janvari 1963 ko bharat-china yuddh khatm hone ke lagbhag do maheene baad hi neshnal stadium main live parform kiya gaya
 It is said that Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had tears in hearing this song
 2
 The song 'kar Chale Hum Fida jaan-o-tan Saathi, Ab Tumke Hawale Watan Saathi' from the film Haqiqat is in the backdrop of war
 isamen ek sainik goli lagane ke baad hansate-hansate apni jaan detaa he or apane saathiyon ko desh kii raksha karne ke liye kahata he
 3
 shahid-e-ajam bhagat singh ke jivan par bani film shahid main aazaadee ke mastaanon ke 'meraa rang basanti chola, maa
 
 
 a
 
 
 rang de basanti chola' gane ko bhagat singh par bani har film main liya gaya he
 Freedom fighter Ram Prasad Bismil wrote the song and is said to have sung the song even before Bhagat Singh embraced death
 4
 The song 'ae Watan, Ae Watan, Hamko Teri Kasam, Teri Rahaon Mein Jaan Tak Lut Jaane Jaaye' is the patriotic song of the film

 Makes the hair of those who love the country stand out
 5
 The song 'aye Mere Pyare Vatan, Aye Mere Bichde Chaman, Tujhpe Dil Kurban' from the film Kabuliwala still evokes patriotism
 khaastaur par jo log desh or apane ghar se dur hai ve isi gane ke jariye apane ghar ko yaad karte hai
 6
 apane desh kii tarif, desh kaa sammaan karnaa bhi deshbhakti hi he
 In the film shaheed-e-azam's song 'where the gold bird does roost on the wall, it is Bharat Desh Hai Mera', when Manoj Kumar is seen praising his country, every Indian's chest becomes wide with pride
 
 7
 In the east-west film, the song emanating from the lips of Manoj Kumar is 'preet Jahan Ki Reet Sada, i sing the song there, i am a resident of India, i talk about India' and a wave of heart rises and Lightning flashes throughout the body
 is geet main bhi bharat kii tarif main jabardast bol likhe gaye hai
 8
 film upkaar main jab manoj kumaar 'mere desh kii dharti, sona ugale, ugale heere-moti' gaate dikhte hai to dil main yakeen hone lagata he ki sach main desh kii dharti se sona-chaandi or heere-moti nikalate hai
 This song, saluting the soil of the country and the hard work of the farmers, still prevails on the tongue of every child
 tippaniyan 9
 desh aaazaad hua to uske baad bhi aazaadee ko barkaraar rakhane kii jarurat hoti he
 The enemy's evil eyes are often on the country
 aise main film leader kaa geet 'apni aazaadee ham haragij mitaa sakate nahin, sar kataa sakate hai lekin sar jhukaa sakate nahin' desh ke prati samarpan ko darshata he
 This song says that even today there is no shortage of people who are ready to cut their heads for the country
 10
 The song of the film Karma, 'har Karam Apna Karega, Ae Watan Tere Liye, Dil Diya Hai, Jaan Bhi Denge, Ae Watan Tere Liye', gives the message of fulfilling our every Karam to preserve the country's independence
 ye ham sabakaa dharm he ki ham apane desh kii aazaadee ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye har koshish karen
 When the country became independent after a long struggle, more than one devotion films were made
 jinamein aazaadee ke veeron kii kahaniyaan thim, aazaadee kaa sangharsh tha or sunahare bhavishya ke liye sapane bhi the
 At such a time, the patriotic songs that were made created a wave in the hearts of the people
 deshbhakti ke gaanon main sabase pehla geet agar kisi ke bhi jehan main aata he to vah gaanaa he
 
 
 1
 'i mere vatan ke logon, tum khub laga lo naaraa This is auspicious day for all of us, hoist the tricolor par mat bhuulo seemaa par, veeron ne hai praan ganvaae Remember them too - 2 jo laut ke ghar naa aae -2 Hey people of my country, just fill the eyes with water, jo shahid hue hai unki, jaraa yaad karo qurbaani -2' This song written by poet Pradeep c
 ramchandra ne compoj kiya or swar kokila lata mangeshkar ne apni aawaaj di
 The song was performed live at the National Stadium on January 27, 1963, almost two months after the end of the india-china war
 kaha jaataa he ki is gane ko sunakar pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru kii ankhon main aansu aa gaye the
 2
 film hakeekat kaa gaanaa 'kar chale ham fida jaan-o-tan saathiyon, ab tumhaare hawaale vatan saathiyon' yuddh kii prishthbhumi main he
 In this, a soldier loses his life after being shot and asks his comrades to protect the country
 3
 In the film Shaheed on the life of shaheed-e-azam Bhagat Singh, 'mera Rang Basanti Chola, Ma
 
 
 e
 
 
 The song 'rang De Basanti Chola' has been taken in every film made on Bhagat Singh
 swatantraaa senaanee ram prasad bismil ne is geet ko likhaa he or kaha jaataa he ki bhagat singh ne maut ko gale lagane se pehle bhi is geet ko gaaya tha
 4
 shahid film ke geet 'i vatan, i vatan, hamako teri kasam, teri rahon main jaan tak lutaa jaaenge' deshbhakti kaa pramukh gaanaa he
 This song is still heard anywhere in Mukesh's voice
 
 
 desh se pyaar karne waalon ke rongte khadey kar detaa he
 5
 film kabuliwala kaa geet 'i mere pyaare vatan, i mere bichade chaman, tujhpe dil qurbaan' aaj bhi deshbhakti kii alakh jagaata he
 Especially those who are away from the country and their home, they remember their home through this song
 6
 Praising our country, respecting the country is also patriotic
 film shahid-e-ajam kaa geet 'jahaan daal-daal par sone kii chidiya karti he baseraa, wo bharat desh he meraa' main jab manoj kumaar apane desh kii tarif karte najar aate hai to har hindustani kaa seenaa garv se chaudaa ho jaataa he
 7
 film purab-pashchim main manoj kumaar ke honton se nikalataa geet 'he preet jahaan kii reet sadaa, main geet vahaan ke gaata hum, bharat kaa rahane vaala hum, bharat kii baat sunaata hum' ko sunakar dil ke ek sire se lahar uthati he or puure tan-badan main bijli si kaundh jaati he
 This song also has tremendous lyrics written in praise of India
 8
 In the film Upkar, when Manoj Kumar is seen singing 'my country's soil, gold sprouted, sprouted diamonds and pearls', it is believed in the heart that gold and silver and diamonds-pearls come out of the land of the country
 desh kii mitti or kisaanon kii mehnat ko salaam karata yah geet aaj bhi bachche-bachche kii jubaan par chadha rahata he
 The comments 9
 If the country is independent, there is a need to maintain independence even after that
 dushman kii buree nazren desh par aksar lagi rahati hai
 In such a situation, the film leader's song 'we cannot erase our freedom, we can cut our heads but cannot bow our heads' shows our devotion to the country
 yah geet bataata he ki aaj bhi aise logon kii koi kami nahin he jo desh ke liye sar kataane ko bhi taiyaar hai
 10
 desh kii aazaadee ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye apana har karam puraa karne kaa sandesh detaa he film karma kaa geet 'har karam apana karenge, i vatan tere liye, dil diya he, jaan bhi denge, i vatan tere liye'
 It is the religion of all of us to make every effort to preserve the independence of our country
 deshbhakti ke gaanon main sabase pehla geet agar kisi ke bhi jehan main aata he to vah gaanaa he

 film kabuliwala kaa geet 'i mere pyaare vatan, i mere bichade chaman, tujhpe dil qurbaan' aaj bhi deshbhakti kii alakh jagaata he

 In the film Upkar, when Manoj Kumar is seen singing 'my country's soil, gold sprouted, sprouted diamonds and pearls', it is believed in the heart that gold and silver and diamonds-pearls come out of the land of the country

 If the country is independent, there is a need to maintain independence even after that

 The song 'aye Mere Pyare Vatan, Aye Mere Bichde Chaman, Tujhpe Dil Kurban' from the film Kabuliwala still evokes patriotism
 khaastaur par jo log desh or apane ghar se dur hai ve isi gane ke jariye apane ghar ko yaad karte hai

 apane desh kii tarif, desh kaa sammaan karnaa bhi deshbhakti hi he
 In the film shaheed-e-azam's song 'where the gold bird does roost on the wall, it is Bharat Desh Hai Mera', when Manoj Kumar is seen praising his country, every Indian's chest becomes wide with pride

 In a program of chartered accountants in Ahmedabad, Swamy said that the government had pressurized the officials of the Central Statistical Organization (CSO) to give better economic figures to show that demonetisation has no adverse effect on the economy and GDP
 swami ne GDP ke maujuuda aankadon ko farji qaraar de diya
 Swamy said, 'do not go to the quarterly figures of GDP

 radhe maa kii english class, jaanakar hairaani to hogi, lekin agar aapane radhe maa kii class main hissaa nahin liya to pachhataayenge kyonki radhe maa on da spot english bhi sikhaa detii hai
 He showed this by doing it in up's care
 patrkaar sawaal poochne aae the, magar radhe maa ne sawaal ko kinare kar apni english kii class shuru kar di
 Radhe Maa went to Mumbai to participate in Sambhal's Kalki Mahotsav, but Radhe Maa did such a drama that after seeing face to face with journalists in the festival, the audience just kept looking
 radhe maa kaa andaaz dekhne laayak tha
 Radhe Ma who reached the Kalki festival folded her hands and said "jai Mata"
 phir ek patrkaar se kah diya ki us par shani kii dasha chal rahi he, canphes karoge to khush rahoge
 And then Radhe Ma's English class started

 And in his own style, he began to ask the reporters to translate the broken English sentences
 jab patrkaar nahin maane to radhe maa kaa paara chadh gaya

 aise avatar main, jahaan khamoshi to dur jeebh se aag or ankhon se angaare nikal rahe the
 His anger was worth seeing
 wo bilkul alag tarah se dikh rahi thi
 During the Kalki festival, while answering the questions of journalists, Radhe Maa once again got so restless that at first she became red-yellow in anger and then ran away leaving the press conference in the same manner
 thik jaise ab se chand rose pehle ajtak ke intervyuu ke dauraan wo rote-rote camere se bhaag gai thim
 But why did Radhe Ma get so angry? Why was she so shocked by the questions of journalists? After all, why did she turn journalists upside down on questions of allegations? When you hear the full press conference of Radhe Maa, sometimes you will be surprised and sometimes you will laugh and laugh
 darasal, radhe maa par aaropon kii ek lambii fehrist he
 Some of these allegations where airs over time
 vahiin kuch aise bhi hai, jo ab bhi uskaa peechha kar rahe hai
 Then whether it is the charge of spreading obscenity, of harassing a girl for dowry, of conspiring against her own master or of threatening someone by telephone at midnight
 lekin aaj se pehle radhe maa ke bare main kam se kam koi ye nahin kah saktaa tha ki radhe maa ne kabhi kisi ke saath budtameezi kii yaa phir oonchi awaz main baat kii lekin jo ajtak nahin hua tha, wo sanbhal main ho gaya
 After giving several interviews one after the other over the last week, Radhe Maa's confidences were so high that she went over her head in the face of facing the camera and answering the questions of journalists
 sawaalon kaa sidhaa-sidhaa jawaab dene yaa chup rahane kii bajaay radhe maa ne patrakaron ko hi hadakaana shuru kar diya
 Sometimes asked some question that the condition of Saturn is going on you, then sometimes asked whether you have washed the milk
 lekin jab patrakaron ne radhe maa ke is andaaz par aitaraaz kiya, to dekhie radhe maa kaise palat gai
 Said, i am a mother, does a mother not have the right to be angry with her children
 balki saath hi saath ye bhi jod diya ki maa to bacchon ke saamne nakhre bhi karti he or bacchon ko wo har nakhre uthaane hi padate hai
 Well, during this press conference, Radhe Maa tried to prove that no one should make the mistake of considering them nineteen in terms of being educated, by speaking two four lines of English and Alphaz
 tabhi to dekhie apni padhai likhaai se judi ek sawaal par radhe maa kaise hathe se ukhd gai
 Speaking English like Goya is a measure of someone being educated or illiterate
 vaise in sabake bich ek or mazedaar baat ye rahi ki radhe maa ne abaki ek baar phir apana vahi saalon purana jumala bol daalaa, jo usne khud par dahej kaa aarope lagane ke baad pehali baar camere kaa saamana karte hue bolaa tha
 Yes, i am pure and emulsion
 balki is baat to khud ko pyor and paayas bataa kar patrkaar se bhi puch daalaa ki bataao kya samajhe
 Till now everything was fine, the extent was reached when Radhe Ma cursed a journalist in Negusse
 ek sawaal par itani baukhalaai ki kaha tum dekhnaa ki agle 15 dinon main tumhaare saath kya hota he? wo patrkaar samajhadaar niklaa, jisane is shraap ko hawa main uda diya, varanaa koi bhakt tip item hota to shaayad isi shraap par uskaa dil baith gaya hota
 And then it happened that the organizers of the event had to come to the rescue, but finally the end of this press conference happened in the same way as the interviews and press conferences of Radhe Maa have started happening in recent times
 ji haa, vahi ro-dho kar radhe maa bhaag nikali
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attack on VIP culture has been welcomed by UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath with immediate effect

 That is, vehicles from red and blue lights will not be visible in UP from today

 CM Yogi not only saw the presentation, but also issued a decree to execute the decision of PM Modi
 siem yogi ne puure rajya main 21 april se hi laal or neeli batti ke istemaal par brake lagane kaa aadesh jari kar diya
 In the meeting, it was decided in the meeting that no leader, minister or officer would put red and blue lights on their vehicles
 yani aaj se netaaon yaa adhikariyon kii gadiyon par koi batti najar nahin aegi
 If the order is violated, action will be taken against those who do so
 bataa den ki hooter bajaane kaa aadesh pehle hi khatm kiya ja chukaa he
 However, after the decision of the Central Government, several ministers including the state minister Swati Singh had already removed the red light from their car
 jabaki adhikari badastoor apni gadiyon par pehle kii tarah neeli batti lagaakar chalate rahe
 Not only this, the children and family members of many officials also reached the school with blue lights, and the market kept roaming
 bataa den kimodi cabinetane buudhvaar ko gadiyon se laal batti hataane kaa faisla liya tha
 After the decision, the Union Ministers immediately started removing the lights from their vehicles
 is faisle ke baad piem modi ne kaha tha ki ye culture pehle hi khatm ho janaa chahie tha
 On the other hand, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari says that strict action will be taken against those who will not follow this rule

 Amit Kumar confirmed this by speaking exclusively to us
 amit kumaar ne kaha, 'yah byopic nahin ban rahi he kyonki kaaphi samay ja chukaa he, pichley 8 saal se baithkar sirf baatcheet ho rahi thi, kuch bhi aage nahin badha, isliye ab ye film nahin banegi
 We were just wondering what is happening, how it is happening, but the matter did not go ahead
 'amit kumaar ne aage kaha,'byopic karnaa bhi nahin chahie,koi kyon karegaa or koun karegaa? koi bhi kishor kumaar jaisaa nahin ho saktaa, koi bhi unke jaisi acting or singing nahin kar saktaa
 However, on December 9, Amit Kumar's film industry will complete 50 years and on this occasion a special program has been organized where more than one industry stars are going to reach

 We all know and often say that Aamir Khan uses media in the most and better way
 ham ye bhi kehete or dekhte hai ki film release ke samay shahrukh khan ek ek din main do-do yaa teen-teen baar media ke saamne aate hai magar shahrukh hon yaa aamir, ye sab peeche hai kangana ranut se
 According to what i have seen in the last few years or from that point of view, i cannot say better than Kangana, but i can say that no one uses the media more than Kangana Ranaut or no one lives in newspapers more than Kangana
 kangana kii film release ke kagaar par khadi ho yaa na ho, kangana ko isse koi asar nahin padataa
 If you pick up any newspaper in Mumbai in the morning, almost every newspaper has to have a story related to Kangana or some picture of Kangana
 unamem se zyaadaatar akhbaaron ke eps hai jinke madhyam se soshal netwarking cites or websites par ye stories pahunchati hai or phir subah kii ye khabaren shaam hote hote news channels or mujeec channels par chalane lagati hai
 i once asked Kangana this question whether your films come or not, you live in the news every day
 isaki kya zarurat? tab kangana ne kaha tha, 'main apana kaam karti hum or hamaari piaar agency apana kaam karti he or meri agency acha kaam kar rahi he
 ' mujhe lagata he ki kangana ko media kii surkiyon main rahane kaa kuch zyaada hi shauq he or shaayad isliye wo industry kii badi piaar agency ko apane prachaar ke liye moti raqam detii hai
 Media net is purchased by these PR agency in which paid stories are printed
 kangana ne agar apni naukaraani ke bachche ke bukhaar ke ilaaj ke liye paise die hai to wo bhi akhbaar kii khabar banakar aati he
 a big star praises Kangana's work by SMS, that too is made the headlines of the newspaper, etc
 or agar koi agency thodi dhilaai baratati he to kangana foran agency badal detii hai
 i have seen Kangana changing 3 agency in the last 5 years
 tippaniyan Normally stars use media to promote their film but this is not necessary for Kangana
 bas unhen har rose akhbaaron main rahane se matlab he
 Many times the media looks for news of other big stars' quarrels, controversies or their relationship and makes it snappy but in Kangana's case the media does not have to work hard because they themselves send such snappy stories to the media
 kul milakar ye kahana galat nahin hoga ki media or khabaron main kangana se zyaada in dinon koi nahin rahata
 However, it does not have any special benefit because Kangana is a hit when the film is good and a flop when the film is weak
 maine pichley kuch saalon main jo dekha he us hisaab yaa us najariye se kangana se behatar to nahin kah saktaa magar ye kah saktaa hum ki kangana ranut se zyaada media kaa istemaal koi nahin karata yaa kangana se zyaada akhbaaron main koi nahin rahata
 Whether Kangana's film is on the verge of release or not, Kangana is not affected by it
 aap subah main mumbai kaa koi bhi akhbaar uthaaen usamen har rose kareeb kareeb sabhi akhbaaron main kangana se judi koi story yaa kangana kii koi na koi tasviir honi hi honi he
 Most of them are newspaper apps through which these stories reach on social networking sites and websites and then these morning news start running on news channels and music channels in the evening
 maine ek baar kangana se ye sawaal bhi poocha tha ki aapaki filmein aaen yaa naa aaen, aap har rose khabaron main rahati ho
 What do you need? Then Kangana had said, 'I do my work and our PR agency does its work and my agency is doing good work
 ' i think Kangana is very fond of being in the media headlines and perhaps that is why she gives a big amount of money to the industry's big PR agency for her publicity
 in piaar agency ke dwaara media net kharidvaaya jaataa he jisamen ped stories chhapavai jaati hai
 If Kangana has given money for the treatment of fever of her maid's child, then she also becomes a newspaper news
 kangana ke kaam kii koi bada star esemes karke taareef karata he, wo bhi akhbaar kii surkhi bana di jaati he vagairah vagairah
 And if an agency is a little relaxed, Kangana immediately changes the agency
 maine pichley 5 saalon main 3 agency badalte hue dekha he kangana ko
 The comments aam taur par sitare apni film ko promot karne ke liye media kaa istemaal karte hai magar kangana ke liye ye zaruri nahin
 Just by having them in the newspapers everyday means
 kai baar media dusre bade sitaron ke jhagadon, vivaadon yaa unki relationships kii khabaron ko dhundta he or or chatapata banaata he magar kangana ke maamle main media ko mehnat karne kii zarurat nahin padati kyonki wo khud hi aisi chatpati kahaniyaan media ke paas bhejti hai
 Overall, it would not be wrong to say that there is no more in the media and news these days than Kangana
 haalanki iskaa kuch khaas phayda bhi nahin he kangana ko kyonki jab film acchhee hoti he tab hit hoti he or jab film kamazor hoti he tab flop
 Whether Kangana's film is on the verge of release or not, Kangana is not affected by it
 aap subah main mumbai kaa koi bhi akhbaar uthaaen usamen har rose kareeb kareeb sabhi akhbaaron main kangana se judi koi story yaa kangana kii koi na koi tasviir honi hi honi he

 i once asked Kangana this question whether your films come or not, you live in the news every day
 isaki kya zarurat? tab kangana ne kaha tha, 'main apana kaam karti hum or hamaari piaar agency apana kaam karti he or meri agency acha kaam kar rahi he
 ' mujhe lagata he ki kangana ko media kii surkiyon main rahane kaa kuch zyaada hi shauq he or shaayad isliye wo industry kii badi piaar agency ko apane prachaar ke liye moti raqam detii hai
 Media net is purchased by these PR agency in which paid stories are printed
 kangana ne agar apni naukaraani ke bachche ke bukhaar ke ilaaj ke liye paise die hai to wo bhi akhbaar kii khabar banakar aati he
 a big star praises Kangana's work by SMS, that too is made the headlines of the newspaper, etc
 or agar koi agency thodi dhilaai baratati he to kangana foran agency badal detii hai
 i have seen Kangana changing 3 agency in the last 5 years
 tippaniyan Normally stars use media to promote their film but this is not necessary for Kangana
 bas unhen har rose akhbaaron main rahane se matlab he
 Many times the media looks for news of other big stars' quarrels, controversies or their relationship and makes it snappy but in Kangana's case the media does not have to work hard because they themselves send such snappy stories to the media
 kul milakar ye kahana galat nahin hoga ki media or khabaron main kangana se zyaada in dinon koi nahin rahata
 However, it does not have any special benefit because Kangana is a hit when the film is good and a flop when the film is weak

 aam taur par sitare apni film ko promot karne ke liye media kaa istemaal karte hai magar kangana ke liye ye zaruri nahin
 Just by having them in the newspapers everyday means
 kai baar media dusre bade sitaron ke jhagadon, vivaadon yaa unki relationships kii khabaron ko dhundta he or or chatapata banaata he magar kangana ke maamle main media ko mehnat karne kii zarurat nahin padati kyonki wo khud hi aisi chatpati kahaniyaan media ke paas bhejti hai
 Overall, it would not be wrong to say that there is no more in the media and news these days than Kangana

 With the bold batting of Thilan Samaraweera and Ajanta Mendis loosening their strong grip on the match, India is now facing the threat of defeat in the third and final Test cricket match by Sooraj Randiv
 bharat ke liye chauthe din kaa khel utaar chadhaav vaala rahaa
 India at one time took Sri Lanka's seven wickets for 87 runs, but then lost the crucial chance to tie the series 1-1 by giving Sri Lanka a comeback chance
 iske liye samarvira (83) or visheshkar mendis (78) jimmedaar rahaa jinhone nauven wicket ke liye 118 ran kii saajhedaari karke srilanka kaa duusari pari kaa score 267 ran tak pahunchaaya
 India started off to chase a difficult target of 257 runs on the broken pitch of p Sara Oval and struggled with 53 for three at the end of the fourth day's play
 bharat ko ab bhi jeet ke liye 204 ran kii darkaar he lekin paanchaven din is pich par ballebaaji karnaa bahut mushkil hoga
 Right now Sachin Tendulkar is in the crease with 11 and nightwatchman Ishant Sharma scoring two runs
 bharat par chauthe din srilanka ke donon spinner haaavee rahe
 If Mendis showed amazing with the bat, Sooraj Randiv gave the bowling blow to the Indians
 kumaar sangakaara ne is of spinner ko nayi gend saunpi unhone jald hi virendra sahvaag (00), rahul dravid (07) or murali vijay (27) ko pavilion kii raah dikhaakar match par srilanka kaa shikanja majboot kar diya
 Dravid could not prove to be reliable again in this series and was bowled in an attempt to defend Randiv's fast spin-taking ball
 is tarah se dravid ne teen match kii is shrinkhalaa main keval 95 ran banaaye
 Randiv then also sent opener Vijay to the pavilion who made some good shots before that
 is aaf spinner kii leg or middle stump par oochaal leti gend vijay ke balle ke upari hisse se lagakar becoward short leg par jayavardhane ke paas pahunchi jinhone kaaphi nichalaa kaich liya
 For this the umpires, however, had to seek the help of the third umpire
 isse pehle bharat ne match par apni majboot pakad bana lee thi
 While Sehwag was Sri Lanka's top order on Thursday, on the fourth day Pragyan Ojha and Amit Mishra destroyed their middle order but Samaraweera and Mendis gave a big blow to India's hopes
 in donon ne nauven wicket kii saajhedaari srilanka kii taraf se nayaa ricard banaaya
 How much Mendis was dominating the Indian bowlers can be gauged from the fact that he played the highest 157 balls in the Sri Lankan innings, hit the most ten fours and the only six of the innings
 ojha ne iske baad sangakaara (28) ko suresh raina ke haathon kaich karakar srilanka ko karaara jhatka diya

 Samaraweera and Lasith Malinga (15) briefly denied the Indian bowlers success
 malinga ne ojha par do chauke maare lekin sahvaag ne sidhi gend par pagabaadha out karke unki pari kaa ant kar diya
 Samaraweera batted responsibly and took the score with a couple of runs, while Carrom bowler Mendis also hit the first six of the Sri Lankan innings off Ojha

 dilli ketamur nagarilaake main hatya kii vaardaat kaa sisitivi video saamne aa gaya he
 CCTV footage showed the miscreants who killed Rupesh
 usase pehle unhone ek gaadi churaai thi
 It can be clearly seen in the footage that the three crooks went out in the car one after the other after stealing the car
 police sutara bataate hai ki gaadi chori karne ke baad badmaash taimur nagar pahunche or vahaan rupesh hatyakand ko anjaam diya
 The investigation into this sensational murder case has revealed that the murderers had also committed two robbery cases in the Maidan Maidan Enclave area after killing Rupesh Basoya in Timur Nagar area around 9 am on Sunday night
 hatya se pehle bhi badmaash ek gaadi chori kar chuke the
 Actually, 3 accused involved in this murder case had earlier stolen a Honda City car from Jangpura in Nizamuddin area of delhi
 uske baad ravivaar kii shaam ve taimur nagar pahunche or vahaan rupesh kii goli markar hatya kar di
 Then in the Maurya Enclave in the north-west area, the number one in the HO Block No

 In this CCTV footage, the three miscreants are seen leaving the car near Indra Lok Metro Station and running away
 krime branch sutro ke mutabik, rupesh kii hatya main teen badmaashon ke shaamil hone kii jaankaree he
 Because the person who is seen shooting Rupesh in the CCTV footage, the same person is seen leaving Honda City in Inderlok area
 hairaani kii baat ye he ki chori kii honda city car main savaar ye teenon badmaash din dahaade rupesh kihatyake baad ek ke baad ek vaardaaton ko anjaam dete rahe or police unhen pakad tak nahin pai
 Questions are also being raised about the Delhi Police after these incidents

 lekin yah serial kisi kaaran se nahin ban sakaa
 After this, Shivalika decided that she would start her career with a lead role in a film
 iske liye unhone darjanon audishan die, baat bani nahin
 Said Shivalika, 'every girl dreams of becoming the heroine of a Dharma production film and is directed by Karan Johar
 lekin aisa meraa sapana abhi tak puraa nahin hua he
 But i will definitely do a Dharma production film one day, i believe so
 'psychology or angreji se grajuation karne vaali shivalika kahati hai ki ye saali aashiqui ke liye mere naam kaa prastaav amrish puri ke pote or is film ke hero vardhan puri ne hi diya tha
 At his behest, i was called to audition

 But when i read the script of this film, it felt that this film is better for starting a career
 isamen maine niti kaa role kiya he, yah kaaphi strang kairactor he
 When you watch the film, you will feel that my decision is right
 ' shivalika bataati hai ki is film kaa tytil pehle pagal tha
 But after the objection of the censor board it was renamed as Sali Aashiqui
 yah film kii script ke hisaab se sahi he
 Shivalika says that it has a love story
 lekin kuch yuva pyaar ko alag tarah se dekhte hai
 i believe that love is not everything for life
 kariyar par bhi dhyaan dena chahie
 Shivalika is also busy now for her second film Khuda Hafiz, which is shot in Uzbekistan
 isamen unke nayak vidyut jamwaal hai
 With this second film, Shivalika feels that now her career has started on its own path

 a daughter-in-law gave 6 people in-laws a slow death
 Not even a 2-year-old innocent girl was spared 6 deaths in 14 years in a house
 marane waalon main 65 saal ke bujurg se lekar do saal kii bacchee shaamil thi
 Surprisingly every death was happening in the same way
 marane se pehle marane vaale ko bechaini hoti phir seene main dard or uske baad achaanak wo dam tod detaa tha
 People at home feel that death is due to a heart attack
 lihaaza har maut ke baad ghar vaale us maut ko bhula kar sabar kar lete the
 But a son of this house who was living in America has some doubts
 lihaaja wo america se kerala lautataa he
 Then comes a story that has never been heard or heard in recent times
 kahani dhimi maut kii
 Lourdes Matha Church Necropolis, Kudathai, Kozhikode, Kerala 4 October 2019
 aisa isse pehle kabhi nahin hua tha
 Did not happen anywhere
 kam se kam hindustan main to nahin
 The graves were dug several times in connection with several cases
 gade murde nikaale gaye
 But in a cemetery, six graves were dug together and six dead were taken out, which was not seen by people before
 wo chah murde bhi koun se jo pichley 14 saalon main alag-alag vakt par dafnaae gaye the
 It was also the first experience for the Kerala Police to excavate 6 graves simultaneously
 lihaaja police puri taiyaari ke saath yahaan ai thi
 In the camera every grave was being imprisoned
 sabase pehle un chab kabron kii pahchaan kii jaati he
 Those who were to be dug
 iske baad ek-ek kar sabhi chah kabron kii khudaai shuru hoti he
 14 years, 6 deaths, of the same family, which was the oldest grave
 uski umr 17 saal ho gai thi
 While that was the freshest tomb
 wo bhi teen saal puraani thi
 That is, the first corpse in these six tombs was buried in 2002
 jabaki chhathi or aakhri laash 2016 main
 Meanwhile four more dead bodies were buried here
 vaise chah kii chah laashen ek hi parivaar kii thim
 But six deaths occurred within 14 years of distance
 murdon ne kholaa maut kaa rajpahali kisht main police kaa kaam puraa ho chukaa tha
 The dead bodies had come out of the tomb
 laashen bhi kya kankal kahie
 But this is also enough for the police
 kyonki inhen chah kankalon kii jaanch karne ke baad police inke jinda se murda hone kaa sach pataa lagane ja rahi he
 And for this all skeletons were sent for forensic examination
 us jaanch kii report aane ke baad hi ye khulaasa hona tha ki ye chah kii chah aam maut he yaa phir serial kiling? isse pehle ki ye raaj khule, ham aapako in laashon kii hakeekat main jhaank kar kuch sach bataane kii koshish karte hai
 That too with the help of these buried dead
 22 sitambar 2002, pehali maut, anamma thomskerala ke thomas parivaar main anamma kaa wo rutaba sabase bada tha
 The whole family used to follow at the behest of Anamma
 par tabi ek rose achaanak anamma ko bechaini si hoti he
 Annamma dies on seeing this
 ghar waalon ne sochaa anamma kii maut dil kaa daura padane se hui he
 So Annamma was later buried at Kudathai in the ancestral graveyard of the Lourdes Matha Church
 26 sitambar 2008, duusari maut, tom thomynamma kii maut ke thik 6 saal 4 din baad isi ghar main ek or maut hoti he
 This time, the head of the family and Anamma's husband Tom died
 thik anamma kii tarah hi
 First restlessness and then death
 is baar bhi ghar waalon ne yahi mana ki tom kii maut dil kaa daura padane se hui he
 Hence Tom was also buried in this cemetery
 thik anamma ke baraabar main
 30 October 2011, Third Death, Roy Thomas This day, the third death occurs at home
 is baar marane vaala anamma or tom kaa betaa roy thomas tha
 Roy died the same way
 achaanak bechaini kaa alam or phir saason kaa ruk janaa
 The housemates admit that Roy has also had a heart attack
 yahaan tak ki pooy kii bivi kaa bhi yahi maananaa tha
 But this third death in the same way left Roy's maternal uncle Mathew in doubt
 mathew postmortem karaane par ad gaye
 The death occurred due to poison, post mortem and when the report came, everyone was stunned
 40 saal ke roy ke sharir main zehar paaya gaya tha
 That too cyanide
 kaayade se iske baad maamla katl kaa bananaa chahie tha
 The police should have investigated
 par shikaayat ke baavjood police ne maamle kii tafteesh nahin kii or roy kii maut kaa maamla bhi bhula diya gaya
 On April 24, 2014, the fourth death, three years after the death of Mathew Manjadiyilroy, suddenly Mathew also dies this time
 jisane roy kii maut par shaq jataayaa tha or jisaki vajah se pooy kaa postmortem karana padaa tha
 It was revealed from that post mortem report that Roy's death was due to poisoning
 3 may 2014, paanchavin maut, alphinethomas khandaan main maut kaa silsilaa abhi rukaa nahin tha
 But the death this time was shocking
 ghar main do saal kii bacchee alphine kii maut hui thi
 Suddenly the mothers-in-law stopped
 thik vaise hi jaise ghar main baaki logon kii maut hui thi
 Alfine was the daughter of Roy's uncle
 11 janvari 2016, chhathi maut, phili thomsulphine kii maut ke baad ek roj achaanak alphine kii maa phili ko bhi bechaini uthati he or achaanak wo bhi dam tod detii he
 This was the sixth death at home
 ye bilkul vaise hi hui thi, jaise pehle paanch log maare ja chuke the
 That is, it happened in the same way
 kabron se nikaali gai laasheshnamma kaa doosraa betaa or roy ke bhai rozo thomas kerala se dur america main apane parivaar ke saath rahete the
 One by one, death in the same way forced Rosie Thomas to think
 lihaaja wo america se kerala pahunch gaye
 Rosie Thomas arrives at the cemetery with the Kerala Police
 kyonki ab ek-ek kar laashen sach ugalane ke liye baahar aa rahi thim
 The verdict of Rozo Thomas before the investigation into the first death seems absurd to the Kerala Police
 kyonki chah maut jarur hui thi
 But at the distance of 14 years
 lekin rojo ke bhai roy kii postmortem report police ko sochane par jarur majaboor kar rahi thi
 After this, the police decide to investigate Roy's death in 2011, ie, eight years from now
 or is tarah ek katl ab paanch katl kaa suraag dene ja rahaa tha
 Sister-in-law married uncle's son Rozo Thomas, six members of the house were continuously suffering death
 maa-baap, bhai, mamaa, chachaa ke bete kii patni or beti kii maut ho chuki thi
 But what was most troubling Rojo is that his sister-in-law Jolly got married to Shaju in 2017, a year after the death of Philly's uncle Shaju's wife, Philly
 praparty ke kagajaat se shaq hua pukhtiske baad rojo ne ghar kii praparty ke kagajaat dekhe to pataa chalaa ki zyaadaatar praparty uski bhabhi jolly ne apane naam kar lee he
 That too with the fake signature of her husband Roy and in-law father-in-law i
e
 Annamma and Tom
 isi ke baad rojo ne police main shikaayat kara di or shaq jataaya ki pichley 14 saalon main uske parivaar main hui chah maut saamaanya maut nahin balki katl hai
 For this, Rojo also cited the post-mortem report of his brother and Jolly's husband Roy, which said that poison was found in the body
 police ne aisa kiya khulassamaamle kii jaanch karne vaale adhikari ne khulaasa kiya ki saare katl darasal, jolly ne hi kiye the
 She killed Anamma first as she was the most important member of the family
 ghar kii tamaam chizein vahi dekhati thim
 He was killed because he could control all the financial decisions of the family
 jolly saas anamma ko maar chuki thi
 Then what did he need to kill father-in-law Tom
 aakhir juli kii saazish main tom kii maut kii vajah kya thi
 Jolly's second death was with Jolly's father-in-law
 unki hatya kii vajah ye thi ki wo lagaataar ghar kii kai property ko bechate ja rahe the
 They evicted Jolly and her husband from the property
 haalanki shuruuaat main apane sasur ke saath uske achche rishte the
 But later some problems arose
 unhone tay kiya tha ki wo tamaam property bench kar america chale jaaengen
 Jolly was exasperated by this
 jolly ne kiya apane pati katiib teesraa number aata he ki jolly ke pati roy thomas kaa
 How did he become a victim of Jolly's intrigue
 roy thomas, jiskaa katl isliye hua kyonki property haath se jaati dekh jolly baukhala gai thi
 There was often a dispute about this in both
 aakhirkaar jolly ne use bhi maar diya
 Mathew had doubted, so the number that came out was Matthew Manjadiyil, who had nothing to do with this property of the Thomas family
 magar parivaar main ho rahi lagaataar maut ke baad wo jolly ko shaq bhari nigahon se dekh rahe the
 Jolly felt that the distinction would be made if Matthew was alive
 jaanch adhikari ke mutabik agali maut mathew kii thi
 After Joe's death, he was insisting on a post-mortem of his body
 use jolly par shaq ho chukaa tha
 And he wanted to reveal the cause of these deaths
 maasoom bacchee ko bhi maar dalakhri main baari thi maasoom alphine kii
 The head of the household, 2-year-old daughter of Shaju, son of Zakaria, Tom's younger brother, was Alfine
 jolly ne use kyon maaraa
 This question was disturbing
 jaanch adhikari ne khulaasa karte hue bataaya ki jolly apane pati roy se khush nahin thi
 She used to say often
 usne hameshaa shaju jaise pati ke bare main sochaa tha
 She wanted to marry Manju
 magar alphine or phili ke zindaa rahete ye mumkin nahin hota
 So Jolly killed him by adding cyanide to his food
 phir kiya shaju kii patni kaa katsulphine mar chuki thi
 Now it was Philly's turn
 kyonki use markar hi jolly shaju se shaadi kar sakati thi
 So the next number was Philly
 shaju kii bivi phili ko jolly ne pani main zehar milakar diya
 Whose drink he died
 in tamaam mauton ke baad jolly ne shaju ke saath saal 2017 main shaadi rachaa lee
 When Jolly married Shaju after the death of 6 family members, Rojo doubted her for the first time
 or usne america se aakar is puure maamle kii chaanbin shuru karai, tab jaakar katl kii is gahari sajeesh kaa khulaasa hua

 It is a mode of skiing
 abhi tak india main aisa mauka kabhi nahin aayaa tha jab yahaan fish res jaisaa aayojan hua ho
 The main reason for the Chief Minister's direct interest in such sports is the intention of developing Auli as a tourism destination in future
 sheetakaaleen khelon ke liye auli ko bharat main ek bada hub banane kii taiyaari chal rahi he
 During his visit in Auli, the Chief Minister also talked about having good coaches to prepare the skiers locally
 unhone kaha ki auli main yojit hone vaali phis res main shaamil hone vaale sabhi khiladiyon, paryatakon or mahamaanon ko sarkaar kii ore se puri suvidhaayen di jaaengi
 There has not been any heavy snowfall this year, but due to the possibility of further snow in the coming years, winter sports in Auli are now proposed in February
 mukhyamantri ne kaha he ki kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ke saath vichaar vimarsh kar auli main bhavishya main sheetakaaleen khelon, saahasik paryaton or duusari gatividhiyon kii sambhaavnaaon ko talasha jayega

 navaratri ke dauraan nau din tak vrath rakhana aasaan baat nahin he
 In such a situation, it is important that you take full care of your health as well so that your health is not affected during the fast
 is dauraan sahi diet follow karke aap in nau dinon ke vrath ko bahut aasaani se puraa bhi kar lenge or aapke swasthya par bhi iskaa koi kuprabhav nahi hoga
 According to experts, there are many benefits of fasting and this is why they have been followed since ancient times
 haalanki vrath kaa matlab ekadam se khaanaa chhod dena bhi nahin he
 By keeping fast, many toxins present in the body are cleared
 saath hi halkaa khan-paan hone kii vajah se yah pachan kriya ke liye bhi bahut phydemand he
 However, it is important that you know the right way to fast
 vrath ke dauraan thodi-thodi der par kuch-kuch khate rahanaa chahieor raat ke vakt phul mile lenaa chahie
 This is how you prepare your diet chart in Navratri
 din kii shuruyaat green tii ke saath karen
 After that you can take two dates
 2
 You can have fruit, dry fruit and raisins or dry grapes in breakfast
 3
 After that, take milk shake or coconut water
 4
 You can take sago polenta and a glass of buttermilk during lunch
 agar aapako lo beepi kii samasya he to aap sendha namak bhi istemaal kar sakate hai
 5
 din main ek baar lunch ke kuch ghante ke antaraal par dahi kha sakate hai
 6
 shaam ke snacks ke rup main aalu chaat khai ja sakati he
 7
 raat ke dinar ke taur par vegetable soup lenaa sabase adhik phydemand rahegaa
 Apart from this, Kuttu flour podis and potato vegetables can be taken
 8
 Drinking a glass of lukewarm milk before bed is good
 haalanki kai baar yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki vrath ke dauraan khattey falon ke seven se bachanaa chahie kyonki isse acidity ho sakati he lekin yah sahi nahin he
 Consuming fruits during fast is most beneficial
 kai log aise hote hai jinhen vrath karne kaa sahi tarika pataa nahin hota
 If you have a complaint of weakness or some other disease, then be careful during the fast and take your diet carefully
 kya ho sakate hai parinaam:-kamajori hona or chakkar aana-sugar level kam ho janaa-sahi tareeke se neend na aana-takat kii kami-har samay kamajori laganakin logon ko nahin rakhana chahie vrathmadhumeh ke marijon or garbhvatee mahilaon ko vrath karne se parhez karnaa chahie
 Fasting can reduce the sugar level and it is not good

 a perfect example of how a strong intelligence system keeps you two steps ahead of the enemy and how a weak system decides to defeat in the biggest battle can be seen in Chhattisgarh, where the Maoist forces on the strength of their strong system Dusting pichley dinon, jab se sena ne abujhmaad main prashikshan centre ke bahaane bastar main dastak di he tab se bamushkil hi koi din aisa gujara he jab maovadiyon ne kisi ghatana ko anjaam na diya ho
 The unfortunate thing is that the soldiers standing at the front against the Maoists are paying the price of their weak intelligence system while the Maoists are beating them step by step on the basis of accurate intelligence information and within the last one month He has killed more than 40 soldiers
 10 june kii der raat apni military intelegence se mili soochna ke aadhaar par maovadiyon ne dantewada se katekalyan ke liye mine protected whical par savaar hokar nikle javaanon ko raste main gatom ke najadik barudi surang visphot se uda diya
 In this incident, 10 soldiers including seven spos (special Police Officers) were killed
 maovadiyon ne usee nite vijan divaais kii madad se is vaardaat ko anjaam diya jise unhone april 2010 main tarmetala main siarpief par hamalaa kar lutaa tha
 Since this incident, the movement of police vehicles, hitherto considered to be safe at night, has also not been empty of danger
 maovadiyon kaa soochna tantra itnaa tagada he ki police uski kaat nahin talash paa rahi he
 Although the Salwa Judum Campaign, which started in June 2005, destroyed the Maoists' information systems in South and West Bastar and shattered their senses, but they soon formed separate intelligence units
 pehle aloes (local organijeshan squad) or algs (local gorilla squad) ke sadsy graminon, sangham sadasyon, krantikari adivasee mahila sanghathan or bal sangham ke bacchon ke jariye hi police kii gatividhiyon kii jaankaree hasil kiya karte the lekin ab unka soochna tantra tri-stareey ho chukaa he
 The People's Secret Service (PSS) of Maoists, which came into existence about five years ago, collects information through its methods
 maovadiyon ne apana military intligence bhi khadaa kar liya he or apane urban praspective plan ke tahat tectical united front or pheractional cameti kaa gathan bhi kiya he
 Through these, they infiltrate labor organizations, employee organizations and social organizations in urban areas and provoke people against the government and the constitution, and also collect information
 iske thik ulat, idhar andhrapradesh kii tarj par maovadiyon kii gatividhiyon kii soochna hasil karne ke liye police ne special intligence branch (esaibi ) naam kii khufia agency kaa gathan jarur kiya he magar beete chah saalon main adhosanrachana kii kami ke chalate iskaa dhaancha tak thik se khadaa nahin ho sakaa he
 State Home Minister Nankiram Kanwar also considers the weak police intelligence as the reason for the increasing Maoist incidents
 ve do took kehete hai, ''police kaa khufia tantra hi naakaam ho chukaa he
 Despite the three-tier information system, the main base of the Maoists is the Dandakaranya Adivasi Kisan Mazdoor Sangh, better known as the Sangham member
 isse jude adivasee pidiyon se chale aa rahe sanket dene ke taur-tareekon kaa aaj bhi bakhubi istemaal kar rahe hai
 For example, they are clapping, whistling, drumming, flute or making sounds of animals and birds or hanging colored cloth on trees or roofs of the house and giving information about the activities of police and civil security forces in the area
 Let's warn you in advance
 bastar main philhal sangham sadasyon kii taadaad ek lakh se zyada he
 With the deployment of paramilitary forces here for the last two years, Maoists have started giving special attention to the Sangham members
 inhen ab baqayada samaaroh yojit kar sheersh cmanderon kii maujuudagi main jan milicia or aloes or algs main shaamil kiya jaataa he
 On the other hand, the structure and functioning of SIB, the intelligence agency of the police formed against the highly vicious Maoists, is shocking
 maovadi rajya ke do-tihaai hisse main sakriy hai lekin police mukhyalay ne esaibi ke liye mahaj 140 logon kaa amala sweekrut kiya he, jisaki taadaad oont ke munh main jira jaisi hi he
 Not only this, recruitment to the entire posts sanctioned so far has not been done
 39,000 varg kimi bhu-bhaag vaale bastar ke mukhyalay jagadalpur main adad police adheekshak (espi) hi tainaat hai or amale ke naam par he to keval unka vaahan chaalak
 Rather, the SP vehicle has also been destined after going through the whole year
 espi es
 s
 sori ke alaava bastar ke paanch jilon main ek up-nireekshak, paanch sahaayak up-nireekshak or teen pradhan aarakshak hi hai
 Under these circumstances, it is understandable how SIB is doing
 esaibi ke hi kuch adhikari dabi jabaan se kehete hai ki paise kharch kiye bagaiyr suchanaaen hasil karnaa sambhav nahin he
 The magic of money is that the SIB of Andhra Pradesh gets immediate information about the activities of Maoists in the border states as well
 yahi vajah he ki andhra main maovadiyon kaa lagbhag safaya ho chukaa he
 On the contrary, the situation in the state is getting terrible day by day
 lekin police pravaktaa vivekanand, jo esaibi ke-up mahanireekshak bhi hai, khufia tantra ke kamjor hone se inkaar karte hue kehete hai ki ek-do ghatnaon ke kaaran khufia tantra par sawaal nahin khadey kiye ja sakate
 "SIB is an internal matter of the police, efforts are on to strengthen it," he says
 ''vaise, esaibi ke alaava jilon main police ke captain kaa khufia tantra bhi hota he, jo apane mubir, gopneey sainikon or espeo kii madad se soochna hasil karata he
 Apart from this, the Intelligence Bureau of the Central Government also collects information related to Maoists and gives them to the states
 espeo kii madad se police kaa soochna tantra kuch had tak majboot jarur hua he
 Apart from familiarity with the area, they are also knowledgeable about the local dialect
 inamen aatmasamarpan kar chuke maovadiyon ke hone se police ke liye unke taur-tareekon kaa andaaj lagaana bhi sambhav ho paa rahaa he
 Police has also achieved many successes with the help of SPO
 inaki hi sahaayta se police aise ilaakon main ghus paa rahi he jahaan vah beete do dashakon se nahin ja paa rahi thi
 These spos are the main enemy of the police information system, the biggest enemy of the Maoists today
 gat paanch saalon main maovadiyon ne 300 se zyada espeo or unke parijanon kii hatya kii he
 This is the reason why no one is willing to talk to new people in the interior areas and before the police arrives, the entire village becomes empty and the police continue to shake hands
 maovadi khauf ke bal par soochna tantra ko viksit karne ke saath hi police ke tantra kaa khaatmaa kar rahe hai
 They ruthlessly throw the corpse along the main road miles away after brutally stabbing the police informers to death in a mass court to get more publicity for the incident
 ve laash ke saath hi dhamkee bharaa parchaa bhi chhod jate hai ki police kaa saath dene waalon kaa yahi anjaam hoga
 More or less they do the same for those people who, despite knowing them, do not inform about the activities of the police
 itnaa hi nahin, gasht par nikali police ko dabaav main aakar yadi koi khaane-pine kaa samaan de detaa yaa unhen rasta bataa detaa he to ve use bhi nahin bakhshate
 As such, the state did not take advantage of the strengthening of police information system after Salwa Judum, which was raised in the 60s from Koya Rebellion in the tribal-dominated Sitamapeta area of coastal Andhra Pradesh, while the Maoists were comparing it to Koya rebellion
 ise thos ranneeti kaa abhaav hi mana ja saktaa he
 The lack of penetration among the villagers is also the main reason for the continuous failure of police on the front against the Maoists
 lekin police ne is disha main kabhi koi gambhir prayaas kiya hi nahin jabaki gorilla warfare kaa siddhant hi he-jeet usee kii janata jiske saath
 On the contrary, even though the Maoists have a savage killer among outsiders, they treat people well in their area of influence
 adivaasiyon ke bich unki chhavi rahanuma kii tarah he
 The surrendered Maoists point out that an area commander honors a common tribal as he gives to his top commander
 maovadi har dam chaukanne rahete hai jabaki police kii laaparvaahee jab tab haadason ke rup main dikh jaati he
 In guerrilla warfare, the enemy is always surprised by taking action in some new way
 maovadi apni dirghakaalin ranneeti ke tahat iskaa shuru se hi anusaran karte aa rahe hai jabaki police aaj bhi bina kisi thos ranneeti ke paaramparik taur tareekon se hi nipatane kii nirarthak kavayad kar rahi he
 In the three-tier information system of the Maoists in irrefutable, impregnable and strong-bed, they gain knowledge at the primary level with the help of allied organizations including PSS, Digar military, political units
 state military kamishan ke gathan ke baad 2009 main maovadiyon ne military intelegence kii jarurat samajhi or salbhar main ise gathit bhi kar liya
 The Military Intelligence collects all the information related to the security forces there before the big attack and along with that the blueprint of the area is prepared and handed over to its military units
 iske aadhaar par maovadi purvaabhyas karne ke baad hamale ko anjaam dete hai
 At present, major incidents in Bastar have taken place only on the trail of military intelligence

 Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Saturday compared the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to the terrorist organization ISIS

 But we need to understand why Muslims are joining it, why are they getting trapped? ”he added,“ So we oppose organizations like ISIS in the same way as they oppose the RSS
 agar islam main aise log hon jo galat chijen karte hai, to ve aresas se kam nahin hai

 Former BJP national president Rajnath Singh on Sunday said that by giving reservation in the name of religion in the greed of votes, the Congress party is playing with the feelings of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
 rajnath singh ne kaha ki nehru ne kaha tha ki majahab ke naam par aarakshan vinaashkari va vibhaajankaree he
 On Sunday, Rajnath Singh was addressing an election rally in support of party candidate Rampharan Pandey in Gilloula town of Shravasti assembly constituency
 unhone daawa kiya ki pradesh main bhaajapa bahumat kii ore bad chali he, kyonki congress, sapa va basapa shashan main desh va pradesh kii durdasha dekh chuki janata ko vishwaas ho gaya he ki bhaajapa hi susaashan de sakati he
 He said that BSP and Congress are two sides of the same coin
 congress ne chalis varsh ke shashan main pradesh ko kya diya yah sabake maaloom he or basapa shashan main bhrashtachar kaa bolbalaa tha or basapa shashan kaal main hi sabase bada ghotaalaa hua
 Addressing an election rally in Farrenda assembly constituency in support of party candidate and sitting MLA Bajrang Bahadur Singh, Singh accused the BSP of abetting the public with promise to end the erstwhile Samajwadi Party's Gundaraj in 2007
 His promises were trusted
 unhone kaha ki pichley chunaav main basapa mukhiya mayawati ne kaha tha ki unki sarkaar bani to mulaayam-amar jail jaayenge, magar paanch saal biit gayi unhone apana vaada nibhaayaa nahin

 On Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi's claim that his party will not join hands with SP BSP in the state, Singh said that if his claim has merit, Congress should stop taking support of SP BSP to run UPA government
 rajnath singh ne kaha ki sapa shashan main aparaadhiyon kaa raaj tha or kaha ki bhaajapa yadi satta main ai to pradesh vaasiyon ko aparaadh mukt pradesh kaa sapana puraa karte hue pradesh ko bhrashtachar se mukti dilaayi jaayegi
 Singh said that the BSP government's Iqbal is over and both the central and state governments are steeped in corruption
