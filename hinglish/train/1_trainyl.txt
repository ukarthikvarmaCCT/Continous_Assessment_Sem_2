 Apart from this, the Supreme Court has made it clear that it is not possible for Delhi to get full statehood
 supreme court ke faisle se saaf he ki dilli kii chuni hui sarkaar hi rajya ko chalaane ke liye jimmedaar he
 After the decision, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has also expressed happiness by tweeting that he has said that democracy has won in Delhi
 aam aadmi party lagaataar aarope lagaati rahi he ki centre kii modi sarkaar alji ke jariye apana agenda aage badha rahi he or rajya sarkaar ko kaam nahin karne de rahi he

 com / xejwv5urtw sachin tendulkar bhale hi lords par kabhi shatak nahin bana paae lekin england ke anya maidaanon par unka balla khub chalaa he
 It is therefore to be hoped that the Emperor of Records will soon complete his 100th international century
 cricket ke makka lords par tendulkar ne shuru se hi behad lachar pradarshan kiya he
 Of the five Tests he has played on this ground, he has scored only 195 runs and his highest score is 37 runs
 vah bharat or england ke bich yahaan khele gaye pehle test match main 34 or 12 ran hi bana paae the lekin jab england ke anya maidaanon kii baat aati he to tasviir ekadam se badal jaati he
 He has bid on grounds such as Trentbridge, Edgbaston, Manchester, Handingley but is awaiting his first century at the Oval, another ground in London
 ovel main is shrinkhalaa kaa chauthaa or anti test match hoga
 The second Test will be played at Trentbridge ground in Nottingham from 29 July
 is maidan par tendulkar ne teen match main 78
 Has scored 469 runs at an average of 16
 unhone 1996 main trentbrij par jo pehla match khelaa tha usamen 177 ran thoke the lekin tendulkar ko satark rahane kii jarurat he kyonki iske baad unhone is maidan par jo do anya test match (2002 or 2007 main) khele un donon main vah nervas ninties ke shikaar bane the
 Like the Lords, Tendulkar's record at the Oval, the other famous Test ground in London, is not attractive
 is maidan par unhone ab tak teen test match main 158 ran banaae hai jisamen unka ucchtam score 82 ran he
 Tendulkar will now try to score a century at the Oval in the fourth Test match from August 18
 in chaaron maidan ke alaava tendulkar ne england ke manchester or leeds main bhi test match khele hai
 It was at Manchester's Old Trafford ground where Tendulkar hit his first century of international career in 1990
 yah unka nauvaan test match tha jisaki duusari pari main unhone naabad 119 ran banaaye the
 Apart from this, he also played a Test match in Hendigley, Leeds, in which he scored 193 runs in the only innings
 bharat ko is daure main in donon sthanon par test match nahin khilne hai lekin vah manchester main twanti-20 match khelegaa
 Tendulkar is not a member of the Indian Twenty20 team but he may get another chance to score a century on Lord's in this tour
 bharat ko england ke khilaaf chauthaa ekadivasiy match isi aitihaasik maidan par khelnaa he or van-de main bhartiya pari kaa aagaaj karne vaale tendulkar tab mauka nahin ganvaana chahenge
 Team India will win the second T20 match on Friday and will again go down with the intention of making a series against the dreaded England
 mangalvaar ko bharat ne behtareen harfanmaulaa khel kaa pradarshan kar mejabaan team ko aath wicket se haraakar teen maichon kii siries main 1-0 se badhat banaai thi
 In the first match, Kuldeep Yadav, the 'magician' of the wrist, took 5 wickets for 24 runs, which created a panic in England
 english khemaa ab net par abhyaas ke liye spin gendbaaji mashin ‘merlin’ kaa istemaal kar rahaa he, kyonki uske paas abhyaas kii khatir kalai ke spin gendbaaj nahin hai
 Earlier this machine was used by England before the 2005 Ashes, when Australia had a spinner like Shane Warne
 merlin mashin (getty)england ke captainion morganasvikaar kar chuke hai ki siries ke pehle tii-20 mukaable main kuldeep yadav ne unke ballebaajon ko puri tarah chaka diya
 Morgan also said that if the host team has to give a tough competition to India in the series, then the rest of the matches will have to perform better against the wrist spinners of the visiting team
 We've been training hard with this ⬇️ ahead of our second Vitality IT20 against India

 Ferozeshah never reached the culmination of the cricket thrill in the last one year at the Kotla ground, which he touched on Saturday
 rajasthan royles par 18
 After dominating for 3 overs, the Delhi Daredevils team finally lost by five runs in their second match of the sixth edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) after a dramatic change
 ipel ke is sanskaran main dairedevills kii yah lagaataar duusari haar he jabaki 2008 kii champion rajasthan ne jeet ke saath aagaaj kiya he
 Delhi were defeated by Kolkata Knight Riders in the inaugural match
 is tarah kotla main dilli kii team rajasthan par lagaataar duusari jeet se chook gai
 Earlier, during the final clash between the two teams on this ground during IPL-5, Delhi had won but now Rajasthan has equalized the loss
 rajasthan kii jeet ke hero rahe captain rahul dravid (65) or kevin kupar (30 / 3)
 After the stunning innings of Dravid, a surprise final over bowled by Cooper, Rajasthan Royals snatched the match from Delhi in the final nine balls
 dairedevills kii pari ke 19wein over kii duusari gend tak mejabaan team kii jeet pakki najar aa rahi thi lekin bread hoj dwaara 153 ranon ke kul yoga par david warner (77) ko ran out karne ke saath hi halaat badal gaye
 Rajasthan had a chance to return to the match and were heavily rewarded
 19wein over main rahul shukla ne saat ran die or dilli ne us over main ek wicket ganvaaya
 Delhi lost the fourth wicket as Warner
 antim over main use 10 ranon kii darkaar thi lekin kupar ne apane is behtareen over main sirf teen ran die or do wicket jatke
 This over caused a defeat for Delhi
 johaan botha (2) or andra rasel (7) is over main out hue jabaki irfan pathan (naabad 1) or naman ojha (naabad 0) apni team kii haar ke saath pavilion laute
 It looked as though Delhi would take a big win with a resurgent comeback after an embarrassing defeat in the opening match at the hands of Kolkata Knight Riders, but the scene changed after Hodge was run out by Warner
 iskaa kaaran tha ki 166 ranon ke lakshya kaa peechha karte hue dilli kii team 19wein over kii teesri gend tak kabhi bhi asahaj nahin dikhi lekin ant main vah 20 overon main chah wicket par sirf 160 ran hi bana saki
 Australian opener Warner, who looked to be the hero of Delhi's victory, faced nine balls and hit a six and a six in his brilliant half-century innings
 warner ne pehle wicket ke liye unmukt chand (23) ke saath 39 ran jode or phir captain mahela jayavardhane (19) ke saath duusare wicket ke liye 43 ranon kii saajhedaari nibhaai

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday met Congress President Sonia Gandhi at his seat early in the first day of the monsoon session and came to know about his condition
 modi duusare vipakshi netaaon mulaayam singh yadav sahit anya netaaon ke paas jaakar bhi mili
 Before the commencement of the proceedings of the House, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, when he reached the Parliament complex, told the media that from the mood of all the political parties, it seemed that everyone would work together to move the country at a faster pace
 modi kaa kahana he ki unhen ummid he ki is baar ke sansad satr main uttam charchaa hogi or mahatvapurn nirnay honge jo desh ko aage badhaane kaa kaam karenge
 Modi says that after talking to all parties, it seems that all will work shoulder to shoulder to give direction to the country
 
 
 
 So this is Modi's strategy, after this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi went and reconciled himself to the leaders of all the party within the House just before the commencement of the proceedings
 mulaayam singh yadav se mulaakaat ke baad modi sonia gandhi kii seat kii taraf bade or haath jodakar sonia gandhi kaa haalchaal janaa
 Sonia Gandhi also stood up and responded to Modi in the same manner
 mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar khaastaur se khud pradhanmantri modi chaahate hai ki vipaksh ke saath sarkaar ke sambandh thik rahen
 In this direction, Modi first went one step further through the media and then reconciled with the leaders of different party
 jiesti par he sarkaar kaa dhyansarkaar chaahati he ki is satr main jiesti sahit kai or anya mahatvapurn vidhaayi kaary ko paas karavaaya jaae
 This is possible only when the government runs properly in coordination with the opposition
 modi nesatr kii shuruyatmen is baat ke sanket de die hai ki vah vipaksh ko bhi saath lekar chalanaa chaahate hai
 This is the reason that whether it is a question of discussing the incident of Jammu and Kashmir, inflation or the case of Arunachal Pradesh, the government is accepting every demand of the opposition to discuss so that important bills like GST are passed in this session
 dilli police kii krime branch ne avaidh kidney transplanteshan racket kaa bhandaphod kiya he
 The police arrested four people associated with the racket while they were preparing a kidney from a donor from Jaipur to a patient from Andhra Pradesh
 is kaam ke liye donor kii farji idi banaai gai thi
 Joint CP Praveer Ranjan said that the wires of the kidney racket are spread to many other cities, which are carrying out this fraud by getting kidney recipients and donors done
 darasal, is maamle kaa khulaasa krime branch kii team ne jaipur ke 24 varshiya yuvak jayadeep sharma ke pakad main aane ke baad kiya
 a few days ago while surfing the internet, Jaideep got some clues that a racket of kidneys buying and selling on the internet is active
 jayadeep ne ise chack karne ke liye sampark kiya to paaya ki is racket ke taar dilli se jude hai
 The people of the racket continuously contacted him on the phone for the next few months and checked whether he had any news of the police
 jab unhen ye yakeen ho gaya ki jayadeep jaipur kaa ek sidhaa saadhaa noujvaan he, to un logon ne use dilli bulaayaa
 According to Joint CP Praveer Ranjan, they called Jaideep to Delhi and stopped him in a house in Hauzrani area
 vahaan us jaise or bhi log maujuud the
 Where a woman named Sulekha Panda supervised all those people
 jo log kidney donnet karne ko taiyaar hote the, vahiin un logon ko training detii thi
 Not only this, Donor is called in several malls to visit the family whose family member has to take kidney
 joint seepi ne bataaya ki jayadeep ko baqayada kidney kharidne vaale parivaar jaisaa huliya diya gaya, baatcheet kii training di gai
 Kidney Recipient Family interaction style was also described
 yahaan tak kii uske puure farji dastavej banaaen gaye
 Including up to the marksheet
 jisamen use telegu vishay main bhi paas dikhaaya gaya he
 Because the family that bought the kidney was from Andhra
 yahaan tak kii uski photo morf karke kidney lene vaale parivaar kii family photo main use joda gaya
 According to the JCP, after about 40 days of the deal, suddenly one day Jaideep was called and told that he would be operated at Batra Hospital that day
 thik yahi vakt tha jab krime branch ne aspataal main red kii or puure process ko bich main rokkar kidney kii kharid farokht ke is racket kaa bhandaphod kar diya
 All the fake documents made by Jaideep were confiscated from the hospital
 is maamle main police ne ek mahila samet 4 logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 The interesting thing is that the kidney brokers used to deal with the kidneys for 40 lakhs but the donor had to get only four lakhs, while the rest of the money was distributed among middlemen
 police ke mutabik aspataal main jayadeep kii kidney transplat karne kii prakriya se pehle ek cameti ne uskaa intervyuu kiya tha
 In which he deliberately gave wrong answers
 lekin baavjood iske aspataal kii kamity ne use kidney donnet karne ke liye feet ghoshit kar diya tha
 Which also proves their collusion
 haalanki ab tak is khel main koi doctor yaa aspataal kaa staff nahin pakadaa gaya he
 But the police are sure that this game is not possible without their collusion
 police is baat kii padtaal kar rahi he
 Also the role of the family is being investigated
 jisane kidney ke liye moti rakam chukaai thi
 Other donors to police from Hauzrani's address
 unhen is cese main gavaah banaaya ja rahaa he
 One of which has also donated another kidney

 The agenda of both parties is to advance development in the state
 gauratlab he ki ramajaan main lagu kiye gaye sijafire ke dauraan javaanon par hamale nahin ruke, iske kaaran bijepi or sarkaar kii kirakiri ho rahi he
 In such a situation, Shah's calling this meeting can be a big sign
 'aglaa siem bijepi kaa hoga'isse pehle bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh rabindra raina ne bayaan diya he ki is baithak main 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav par charchaa hogi
 Apart from this, there will be talks on the organization
 unhone kaha ki agle chunaav main bijepi kaa siem banegaa
 He said that the central government has so far been taking steps to control the situation on the advice of the Chief Minister of the state, Mehbooba Mufti, be it the issue of ceasefire during Ramadan or the issue of talks with separatist faction Hurriyat Conference
 magar kaha ja rahaa he ki modi sarkaar ab koi bhi faisla bijepi mantriyon kii salaah ke bina nahin le sakati he
 Governor can take over the rule According to the opinion sources, the main concern of the Union Home Ministry is about the Amarnath Yatra
 mantralay ko ashanka he ki aatanki kahin tirthayatriyon ko nishaanaa na bana den
 Sources say that Amit Shah would like to know from the party ministers whether Governor's rule should be implemented in Jammu and Kashmir if there is scope for improvement in the situation
 saath hi poocha ja saktaa he ki rajyapal shashan lagu karne kii vajah se sattadhari pidipi se bijepi ke rishte to prabhavit nahin honge?isse pehle jammu kashmir bijepi ke ek varisht netaa ne pitiai-bhashaa se rajya ke party ke sabhi mantriyon ke dilli bulaae jane kii pushti kii he

 Who was called? BJP BJP chief Ravinder Raina and party general secretary (organization) Ashok Kaul have also been called immediately for the meeting
 amit shah ke bulaane par sabhi netaaon ne somvaar ko fouran train pakad lee, jo mangalvaar ko dilli pahunch jaaenge
 The decision to call the BJP leaders of Jammu and Kashmir to Delhi has been taken at a time when the Central Government has decided not to pursue the declared ceasefire in the state
 sarkaar ne sena se kashmir main aatankiyon ke khilaaf phir se karrwai shuru karne ko kaha he
 In view of the prevailing situation in Jammu and Kashmir, it is considered important to immediately invite the cabinet minister of the BJP
 haalanki baithke ke baad hi pataa chal paaegaa ki vastav main party netaaon ko itani jaldi bulaane ke peeche kaa kya makasad he
 Significantly, despite ceasefire in Jammu and Kashmir, the situation in the state has been complicated by the lack of terrorist attacks and the killing of a senior journalist

 Some other leaders who came close to this trinity were: Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Rajiv Gandhi, Narasimha Rao and for some time also Manmohan Singh, when he was elected Prime Minister for the second time
 lekin ye logon ke dilon main poojaneey kaa darja nahin paa sake
 However, now a new contender for that ultimate power is emerging, Narendra Damodardas Modi
 ham apane netaaon ko jis aakaar ke screen or jis rang main dekhte aae hai, donon main bahut badlaav hue hai
 Photographs of Gandhi and Nehru emerging from the reddish-brown aura on television sets with hump-like backs and the playful black-white images of Indira have gone much further
 ab ham netaaon ko hatheli ke aakaar kii screen par dekhte hai, unke tikhe twits ke madhyam se un par najar rakhte hai or unase pehle se kahin adhik kareeb se jude hai
 The manner in which Modi has shown mastery in connecting with people, no other Indian leader has done this till date
 natijatan, keval paanch varshon main unka vyaktitv hamaari samuhik chetana main 70 mimi kii filmi screen se bhi bada ho chukaa he
 Like the legendary German deity Thor (hollywood has made him popular in recent times), Modi is now considered to be the one who can produce thunder clouds and lightning flashes
 ve aise tufaan hai jo matadaataaon ke pairon or najaron, donon kaa apane manachaaha tareeke se istemaal kar sakate hai
 They have now become not just the center of the stage, but the stage itself
 modistan main aapkaa swaagat he
 Not a day passes when no dramatic scene starring the Prime Minister comes before our eyes
 modi ne raashtra ko yah bataane ke liye sambodhit kiya ki unhone aazaadee ke baad se kashmir ko anuchhed 370 ke tahat mili vishesh darje ko radd karne jaisaa mahatvapurn nirnay kyon liya
 Modi stated in Parliament his dream of making the country a $ 50 trillion economy by 2025 and his colleagues supported him by tapping the tables
 yah digar baat he ki 2014 main unke satta sanbhaalane ke baad se hi desh kii arthvyavastha hichkole kha rahi he or philhal desh sabase badi aarthik mandi kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 In the Rajya Sabha (where the government does not have a majority), Modi also exposed the opposition unity and easily passed a law declaring triple talaq as illegal and made it a historic mistake of long-standing discrimination against Muslim women
 Tried to improve
 modi kaa ek nayaa avatar ek tivi channel ke lokapriy sho main dikhataa he
 Wearing green uniforms, he was seen wandering in the jungles of Jim Corbett National Park for the Discovery show
 jab sho ke anker bear grills, jinhone modi ko ''behad udaar' bataaya, ne unase poocha ki kya ve pradhanmantri banane kaa sapana dekha karte the, to unhone jawaab diya, ''meraa dhyaan hameshaa ek hi cheez par rahaa he, raashtra kaa vikaas
 And i am satisfied with that work
 ''india today-karvi incits desh kaa mizaaj janamat surveykshan se pataa chalata he ki modi jis tarah se apana kaam kar rahe hai, usase log na keval santusht hai, balki unhen is baat kaa bhi puraa vishwaas he ki pradhanmantri ne jo bhi kaam haath main liye hai unhen puraa karke dikhaaenge
 The poll, which took place just two months after Modi made a strong comeback to the government with more than 300 seats, leading the bjp's election campaign in the 2019 general elections, shows that Modi's popularity has skyrocketed
 surveykshan main 71 pratishat ne pradhanmantri ke rup main unke pradarshan ko 'acha' or 'utkrisht' bataaya
 This is more than the 69 percent survey conducted in November 2016, soon after his demonetisation was announced
 haalanki, kshetron ke lihaaj se modi kii lokapriyata dakshin main utani nahin he, jitani desh ke anya kshetron main
 And when this analysis is done from the perspective of communities, then their popularity among non-hindus, especially Muslims is less
 yaad rahe ki yah surveykshan modi sarkaar ke jammu-kashmir kii sanvaidhanik sthiti main aitihaasik badlaav karne se pehle karaayaa gaya tha
 His rating would have risen even further after that decision, as 57 percent in the survey said that the BJP should fulfill its promise made in the manifesto to repeal Article 370
 kashmir ke faisle se pehle hi jab unase poocha gaya ki sabase acha pradhanmantri koun he to unhone anya sabhi pradhanmantriyon—indira gandhi (14 pratishat), atal bihari vaajapeyi (11 pratishat) or jawaharlal nehru (9 pratishat) kii tulana main modi ko kahin adhik, 37 pratishat kii reating di
 There is no other leader in recent history who has the talent to recognize the pulse of the public
 iske saath modi kaa jabardast aatmavishvaas, gahari patibaddhta, kadi mehnat, bada sochane kii kshamta or usase bhi bada jokhim lene kii kshamta, asaadhaaran sanchaar kaushal or kaaryon ko bade naatakeey andaaj main sampann karne kii pratibha ke mail ne lagata he, unhen lokapriyata ke maujuuda shikhar tak pahunchaa diya he
 People believe that Modi cannot do anything wrong
 agast 2019 main desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan ke nattejey is soch ke spasht sanket dete hai
 Take the Pulwama terror attack in February 2019 and then the Indian Air Force retaliatory attack on a terrorist camp in Balakot, Pakistan
 haalanki yah ek badi khufia vifaltaa thi jiske kaaran kashmir main hamalaa hua, phir bhi chunaav haarane kaa jokhim yaa usase bhi badtar pakistan ke saath yuddh kaa jokhim mol lekar modi ne hawaii hamale ke liye hami bhar di, jisase unhen jabardast ichhashakti vaale aise netaa ke rup main dekha gaya, jo kadavi goli nigalane ko taiyaar rahete hai
 In the survey, people believed that the powerful nationalist leader and the courage to attack in Balakot, people chose him again
 notebandi par logon kii pratikriya uljhan bhari rahi he
 Earlier, it was seen in mood surveys of the country that after the initial enthusiasm for the declared purpose of demonetisation to bring out black money, in further surveys, people had expressed concern over it because it caused problems for people in private
 The economy had to suffer as well as the loss of jobs
 lekin modi logon ko yah samajhane main safal rahe ki bhrashtachar par ankush lagane ke liye yah kadam aavashyak tha
 And it seems that people understood his point and supported him in elections, regardless of the impact of demonetisation on the economy
 surveykshan main 41 pratishat ne bhrashtachar mukt shashan, notebandi or kaale dhan par waar ko modi sarkaar kii sabase badi uplabdhi mana
 These three things in the survey are more popular than Modi's schemes related to the development of the poor and social reforms like the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to make toilets in every household
 sarkaar ke pramukh vikaas kaaryakramon ke bare main puche gaye sawaalon ke jawaab main logon ne sarkaar dwaara un kaaryakramon ko lagu kiye jane ke tareekon ko lekar santushti jataai
 Interestingly, in the survey people agreed on four other important qualities that can please Modi, they are given the sympathy of the poor, free from corruption, extraordinary involvement with the public and Sabka Saath, Sabka Saath, Sabka Faith (despite this That his party contested 437 Lok Sabha seats but fielded Muslims in only seven seats) has been seen as a confident leader
 vipaksh kii aalochana he ki modi prachaar ke bhukhe, amiron ke pakshdhar, taanashaah, muslim-virdohi or hameshaa chunaav abhiyaan ke mod main rahane vaale vyakti hai lekin surveykshan main logon ne in aaropon ko puri tarah khaarij kar diya he (rahul gandhi, kripaya dhyaan den)
 In January's Country Mood Survey, people cited lack of jobs and farmers' troubles as top of the list of concerns
 isse aam chunaav main vipaksh ko modi par hamale kaa bada mudda mil gaya tha
 But in the August survey, people did not appear to agree with the opposition's allegations and the opposition has no leader more than Modi
 survey main 50 pratishat ne kaha ki vipaksh kii vifaltaa kaa mukhya kaaran yah tha ki uske paas modi kii barabari kaa koi pradhanmantri cheharaa nahin tha or vipaksh chunaavon main vibhajit bhi dikhaai diya
 Although people in the survey acknowledged that both the crisis of farmers and lack of jobs are major concerns before the country, but they feel that Modi has the ability to change the stance of the economy and they will find solutions to these crises
 agar aaj chunaav hote hai to bhaajapa ko jitani siten milane kaa anumaan he, usase pataa chalata he ki modi ajey hai
 The results of the poll indicate BJP winning 308 seats, which is five more than the party won in the recent general election and the party's vote share could increase from 37 percent to one percent
 haalanki congress ke 20 pratishat ke vot share main to koi giravat nahin dikhti lekin surveykshan main uski siton kii sankhya maujuuda 52 se ghatakar 49 ho jane ke sanket milte hai
 The only relief for the Congress is that despite Rahul's decision to step down as president, party loyalists have not left the leaderless party yet
 yah puche jane par ki kya ve maanate hai ki congress teji se gir rahi he, 50 pratishat ne sahmati jataai
 The response to the leadership issue was mixed: 49 per cent felt that only a non-gandhi, non-dynastic leader could revive the party, but when asked about the ratings of Congress leaders, they chose other Congress leaders In comparison, both Priyanka and Rahul gave good ratings
 modi ke khilaaf vipakshi ladaai kaa netritv koun kar saktaa he, iske jawaab main logon ne mamata banerjee ko sarvshereshth vikalp ke rup main dekha he, unke baad akhilesh yadav, arvind kejariwal, naveen patnayak or sharad pavaar aate hai
 Modi is also seen shining in foreign affairs
 log modi ke is nazariye ke bhi himachati hai ki jab tak aatankwaad par purna viraam nahin lagata tab tak pakistan ke saath baatcheet shuru nahin hogi
 People believe that India's relations with America have improved during Trump's reign
 or yah bhi ki modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal main china ke saath sambandhon main dhire-dhire sudhaar jari he
 The leader of the entire power and his great confidence in the nation has many advantages and many drawbacks
 sabase pehle, phaaydon kii baat karte hai
 At the beginning of his second term, Modi expressed his resolve to the three major issues of his party and its guardian organization, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and fulfilled two of them: abolishing Article 370 and similar Implementation of the Civil Code (the Triple Talavery Act is seen as part of it)
 kashmir par faisle se vahaan khushhaali aegi yaa hinsak pratirodh or aatanki hamale badhenge, yah to vakt hi batayega
 Another issue, after the failure of mediation for the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, is that the party is hoping that the decision from the Supreme Court will come its way
 modi ne hindutvvaadi samarthakon ko bharpoor khush rakhaa he, magar sankeern saanskrithik agenda se pare jaakar vikaas model par dhyaan kendrit kiya he jisaki vakaalat dinadayal upaadhyaay jaise aresas ke netaaon ne kii he
 Along with his vision for development and economic prosperity, the recent budget is also supporting his bold agenda, which includes the resolve to make the country a $ 50 trillion economy in five years
 phir bhi, jab arthvyavastha ko badhaava dene ke liye kade sudhaaron kii baat ai, to modi dhamaakedaar ghoshnaaon kii bajaae dhire-dhire kadam badhaane ko tarjeeh dete dikh rahe hai
 "the Prime Minister believes more in efforts to lead in the right direction and steady reforms rather than directionless disruptive measures," says a colleague
 ''lekin unhen is tathy par bhi dhyaan dena chahie ki 50 kharab dollar ke apane sapane ko puraa karne ke liye kade sudhaaron kii ore hi janaa hoga
 With the main sectors like auto and real estate hanging in the balance, there is a clear warning of economic slowdown and the Modi government has to find a solution
 is tarah kii lokapriyata or sansad main baari bahumat kaa ek khatra yah he ki matadaataaon kii ummiden behisaab bad jaati hai
 In such a situation, it becomes very difficult for any leader or government to satisfy the public
 janata kii asaadhaaran apekshaaon kaa kya parinaam hota he, ise sirf bhartiya cricket team hi acchhee tarah se jaanati he
 The team's praise and its players remain heroes as long as the team wins
 lekin jaise hi pradarshan ladkadaaya, lokapriyata teji se girti he or hero aalochanaon ke centre main aa jate hai jaisaa ki haalia vishwa cap main pradarshan ke baad dekha gaya
 The second danger is that if there is no ally or strong opposition with the stature to question your decisions and force your decisions to improve, you may be too quick to pinpoint
 aamtaur par adhinayakawad jaisi sthiti dikhne lagati he or netaa bahut choti mandali par nirbhar ho jate hai
 In his second term, Modi should welcome the suggestions of the opposition and also take the criticisms (including the criticisms of the media) seriously and in his own right
 desh ne haal hi main duusare chandrayan mishan ke liye apane sabase bade rocket jieselvi mark-3 kaa safaltaapurvak pareekshan kiya he, modi or unke sahyogi rocket kii gati se jude bhautikee ke niyamon se kuch sabak sikh sakate hai
 During flight, a rocket also needs a large load to pull the initial flight to a standstill
 iske bina, vah niyantran se baahar ho saktaa he
 The stretch it experiences due to the load helps the rocket to maintain its balance until it pushes enough to break free from the Earth's gravitational force and reaches the desired height
 jaisaa rocket ke saath hota he usee tarah kisi bhi netaa ko apni aalochanaon kaa swaagat karne or unase sabak lene kii jarurat he tabhi vah apni udaan ke dauraan puraa santulan banaae rakhkar vaanchit oonchai ko praapt kar saktaa he
 One of Modi's many strengths is that he is a good listener and learns things very fast
 pradhanmantri in khoobiyon kaa badhibia istemaal kar lete hai, to phir aasmaan bhi unki pahunch se baahar nahin rahegaa
 *** tamilnadu or pudducheri main pichley dinon aae samudri tufaan 'thane' ne baari tabaahi machaai he
 So far 42 people have died due to this storm
 tamilnadu tat par aae tufaan ke baad ab har taraf tabaahi kaa manjar he
 The houses and settlements along the seashore have been completely destroyed due to the winds of 140 km, trees have fallen on the roads, due to which the roads are closed

 In the Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha elections to be held in November, the Vyapamanka issue may once again be hot
 is bich khabaren yah bhi he ki vyaapman maamle kaa khulaasa karne vaale artiai kaaryakarta ashish chaturvedi is baar vidhansabha chunaav bhi lard sakate hai
 According to Ashish Chaturvedi, he has received an invitation from Jai Adivasi Yuva Shakti Yanijayas to contest the Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha election on a party ticket
 chaturvedi ne bataaya ki jais party unhen gwalior east vidhansabha seat se chunaav ladaana chaahati he
 However, Ashish Chaturvedi himself has not yet decided whether he will contest the election or not
 lekin unhone 'aaj tak' se baatcheet main kaha he ki jis makasad se jais chunaav lard rahi he wo us makasad kii safalataa ke liye jais ke saath he
 Ashish Chaturvedi told that talks are going on with his heiress's mentor Dr Hiralal Alaw and soon he will make his decision public
 vahiin vyaapman maamle main duusare vislabloar doctor anand raay ko bhi jais vidhansabha chunaav ke liye indore se tikat dene kii baat to kar rahi he lekin shahari kshetra main party kaa sanghathanaatmak dhaancha itnaa majboot nahin hone ke chalate philhal is par sahmati nahin ban paa rahi he
 Congress will support Congress if it gets respectable seats, Jayas Jayas party also has no objection to support Congress in the upcoming Madhya Pradesh assembly elections, but this is possible only when respectable seats in both parties are discussed
 kyonki jis tarah se ek-ek kar rajnatik partiyaan congress se gathbandhan nakaar rahi hai is surat main philhal aisa hone kii ummid behad hi kam he
 The conference will be held on October 21, Jayas is going to hold a big conference in Manavar on October 21
 vahiin jais ne tay kiya he ki aagaamee madhya pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main party lagbhag 80 aisi siton par apane ummidavaar utaaregi jahaan adivasee voter nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 On the second day of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's claim of "almost reaching out" to a solution to the Kashmir issue at a time with Pakistan, the BJP today demanded detailed information about the "failed solution"
 party ke varisht netaa arun jetali ne yahaan samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ''kashmir kaa vah sambhavit samaadhaan kya tha? bharat kii janata ko is sawaal kaa jawaab jaanane kaa adhikaar he
 He hoped that the Indian government was not moving in the direction of Pakistan in an attempt to resolve the Kashmir issue, which had an unfinished agenda in this regard
 rajyasabha main netaa pratipaksh ne kaha ki pakistan kashmir mudde ke samaadhaan ke liye niyantran rekha ko kamjor karne, uskaa visanikaran karne or kashmir par tripaksheeya vyavastha hone ko 'safalataa' maanata he
 "I hope the government is not moving in this direction
" '' unhone kaha ki pradhamantri ne kal ke apane samvaadadaata sammelan main pehali baar rahasyodghatan kiya ki bharat or pakistan ke khufia doot ek baithak main kashmir mudde ke samaadhaan par lagbhag pahunch gaye the, lekin jab yah safal hota najar aa rahaa tha, tab pakistan ke tatkaaleen shaasha general parvej musharraf ko satta se hatana padaa or vah sambhavit samjhauta atak gaya
 The BJP leader said that since the Prime Minister has for the first time made the revelation that there was going to be a 'solution' to the Kashmir issue, it is necessary that he should take the country into confidence in this regard, what were the things in that 'failed solution'
 
 pradhanmantri kii is tippanee par ki vartmaan vipakshi dal or media kii banisbat itihaas unke prati 'udaartaa' dikhayega, par vyangy karte hue jetali ne kaha ki itihaas ko parakhane dene kaa avasar dene ke liye hi sahi, singh kashmir mudde ke vifal rah gaye us sambhavit samaadhaan ke tathyon ke bare main desh ko bataaen
 He said that Pakistan's agenda on Kashmir is incomplete but India's position on this issue is very clear and that is that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India
 sansad dwaara sarvasammati se 1994 main is aashay kaa prastaav paarit karke kaha gaya tha ki pakistan adhikrut kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he
 India also maintains that the interference of any third party in the Kashmir case is unacceptable
 jetali ne kaha ki bharat ne itane varshon se kashmir mudde kaa antarrashtriyakaran nahin hone dene ke athak prayaas kiye hai or ummid he ki kisi bhi sambhavit samjhaute main kashmir mudde ko lekar hasil kiye gaye laabhon ko vyarth nahin kiya jayega
 Warning, he said that the demilitarization of the Kashmir Valley without destroying the terrorist infrastructure from Pakistan would prove disastrous for the country
 jammu-kashmir ko alag darja die jane (anuchhed 370) ke 'nehruwadi drushtikon' ko trutipurna bataate hue jetali ne kaha ki yah 'alag darja pichley kuch saalon main algaavvaad kii ore' le gaya he
 If Saturn, the God of justice, is angry, then do the gods and humans all tremble
 jindagi sankaton se ghir jaati he
 But do you know that a plant shows the way to remove Saturn's anger, protect it from his retrograde vision
 
 And that plant is Shami's plant
 navagrahon main shani maharaj ko nyaayadhish kaa sthaan praapt he
 Therefore, when Saturn comes, then the native gets the full results of good and bad deeds
 yahi kaaran he ki shani ke coup se log bhaybheet rahete hai
 There are many remedies in the scriptures to please Shani, one of them is the panacea of tree worship
 The fear of Shamshini is intimidating, his curvilinear vision creates shuddering and the mere chant of his crooked gait is also the upheaval in the life of the devotees
 Makes a difference
 lekin pipal or shami do aise vriksh hai jin par shani kaa prabhaav hota he
 It is said that Shani Dev is pleased with his worship
 pipal kaa vriksh bahut bada hota he isliye ise ghar main lagaana sambhav nahin hota
 According to Vastu Shastra, the Shami tree should be worshiped regularly and light a lamp of mustard oil under it, then Shani Dosh is prevented from ill effects
 shami ke panchang se milegi dosha se muktishmi ke vriksh par kai devataaon kaa vaas ek saath hota he
 This is the reason why the use of the problems of the Shami tree in all Yajnas is considered extremely auspicious
 shami ke kaanton kaa prayog tantra-mantra baadha ke or nakaaratmak shaktiyon ke naash ke liye hota he, to vahiin shami ke panchang yani phool, pattey, jaden, tahaniyaan or ras kaa istemaal kar shani sambandhi dosha se jald mukti paayi ja sakati he

 The Paliwal court in its judgment on Friday convicted Ramkishore Ahirwar on charges of misdemeanor and sentenced him to five years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 2,000
 varisht bhaajapa netaa laalkrishna adwani maanate hai ki elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ke faisle se unki ayodhya rathyatra kii sarthakata kii pushti hui he
 But he wants the construction of the Ram temple to be preferred through dialogue
 adwani ne 1989 main rathyatra shuru kii thi or vah mandir abhiyaan kaa pramukh cheharaa the
 He dismissed the criticism of the High Court's Lucknow bench last week's decision to put faith above the law, saying it was only a matter of 'trust in the faith by law'
 unhone apane party adhyaksh nitin gadakari ke is suzav kaa majbootee se samarthan kiya ki muslim sarayu nadi ke kinare par ‘parisar se baahar’ masjid bana sakate hai
 Advani, who is going to turn 84 next month, showed great caution in the statements and he refrained from showing himself victorious after the verdict and did not want to say anything that would create panic in the Muslim community
 jab adwani se poocha gaya ki kya 1989 main somnath se ayodhya tak ke unke mandir abhiyaan ko nyaayalay ke faisle ne doshamukt kiya he to unhone kaha, ‘haa main nirdosh mahasoos karata hum kyonki meraa maananaa he ki 1989 tak bhaajapa is (mandir) andolan kaa hissaa nahin thi jo ki darasal 1949 main shuru hua tha
 On the question of the BJP and the Sangh Parivar's effort to reach a compromise through further action and negotiations, the BJP leader said, "the way forward is that it should be agreed between the two communities that it should be (temple construction in Ayodhya ) '
 adwani ne kaha ki jahaan tak faisle kii baat he yah un lakhon logon kii aakanksha ko prakat karata he jo us sthaan par ram mandir bananaa chaahate hai jahaan ki ram kaa janmasthan mana jaataa rahaa he
 He said, 'but it would be good that it should not only be the decision of the court but also the decision of both the communities
 ’ unhone is baat kii sambhaavna ko bhi khaarij kar diya ki elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ke faisle se kaashi or mathura main dharmasthalon se jude vivaadon par bhi logon ko is aadhaar par aawaaj uthaane kaa mauka mil jayega ki kanoon se upar aasthaa ko variyata di gayi he
 Advani said, 'no no
 donon ke bich koi samanta nahin he
 For this reason, during the negotiations (before 2004 between the NDA government and the leaders of the two communities), Hindus gave a clear message to the Muslim side, which had expressed such apprehension that if they agreed voluntarily on the solution, it would not happen
 ’unhone kaha, ‘hamane tab is bare main baatcheet kii thi
 i do not think this decision is because Ayodhya as a whole has been an issue which changed the political history of the country
 ’ haalanki bhaajapa sansadeey dal ke adhyaksh ne saakshaatkaar ke dauraan is bare main baatcheet nahin kii ki elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ke faisle ne 1992 main vivaadit dhaanche ke vidhwans ko jaij qaraar diya he yaa nahin
 There was no comment from his side on the issue whether the verdict lightened the demolition case
 adwani kaa aaj bhi maananaa he ki jis din vivaadit dhaanche ko giraaya gaya vah ‘unke jivan kaa sabase dukhad din’ tha
 According to Advani, he has always said that those who were in favor of the construction of the temple in this movement did not want to forcefully do it
 unhone kaha, ‘or jab maine yah kaha tha ki main us din (chah disambar 1992 ko) kaaphi tanaav mahasoos kar rahaa tha to divangat pramod mahajan jo mere saath the unhone kaha, ‘aap is mudra main yahaan kyon baithe hai
 We should walk to Lucknow
 ’adwani ke anusaar, ‘maine kaha thik he
 i left around 5:30 pm
 main lakhanu pahunchaa or loksabhaa adhyaksh ko sandesh bheja ki main vipaksh ke netaa ke taur par istipha de rahaa hum
 And my regret was that if any political party wants to get anything, it wants to get it through legal process, not coercion
 ’ adwani ne kaha ki 1949 main ram kii pratimaa sthapit kii gayi or adaalat ne aadesh diya tha ki use hataaya nahin janaa chahie
 He said, 'the doors remained closed for a long time and those who used to come to darshan used to do it from outside
 iske baad rajeev (gandhi) ke shashan main adaalat ke aadesh par daravaaje khole gayi
 The foundation stone of the temple was also done during Rajiv's reign
 ’ bhaajapa netaa ne kaha, ‘at: meraa rukh rahaa he ki jo log mandir bananaa chaahate hai ve kuch bhi kanoon ke khilaaf nahin kar rahe
 Those opposing it are opposing the court order

 Nokia 6
 1 was launched in April last year
 ise echemadi global ne 16,999 rupee kii shuruaati keemat ke saath launch kiya tha
 Now after almost a year, the price of this smartphone has come down by about Rs 10,000 and you can buy it for just Rs 6,999
 haalanki yah nokia kii taraf se oficial price cat nahin he or yah chhot flipcart par mil rahi he
 Budget smartphones are generally available at entry level at this price
 nokia ke hi kuch smartfones hai jo is keemat par milte he or wo entry level divaais hai
 Significantly, Nokia 6
 1 kii ye keemat 3GB ram or 32GB internal memory verient ke liye he
 This smartphone Nokia 3 after the new price found in the offer
 2 or Nokia 2 jaise smartphone jitna hi sasta ho gaya he
 Nokia 6 1 overol ek acha smartphone he
 The design and build quality are also solid for this smartphone
 yani ab ye smartphone nokiy ke 10 hajaar rupee tak vaale smartfones main se best ho gaya he
 Nokia 6 1 ke spacifications kii baat karen to is smartphone main Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 prosesar diya jayega
 Although this chipset is a bit old, but it works well with stock Android
 Nokia 6
 Stock Android has been given in 1 and will get an update of Android Pie
 itnaa hi nahin isamen Android q kaa bhi saport jiya jayega
 In terms of the camera, it will look a bit old, because it has a rear camera
 haalanki is ofer vaali keemat par ye camera bhi thik hi he
 There is a 16-megapixel primary camera, while for selfies it has an 8-megapixel front camera
 Nokia 6
 The design and build quality of 1 is good and the metal unibody is used
 iske liye isamen 6000 aluminium series diya gaya he jo ise premium banaata he
 Overall, the point is that it does not cost Rs 6,999 to look at this phone, but rather it seems to be expensive and premium smartphone
 kuch kamiyaan bhi hai, inamen isaki disple
 Looks old, because now the company is giving full screen display
 lekin isamen bejals hai or isamen kisi tarah kaa noch bhi nahin he

 tejasvi, nitish sarkaar ko unheen morchon par gherte hai jin par kisi tarah kaa samjhauta na karne vaala bayaan nitish kumaar ne diya he
 Nitish Kumar is known for saying the right thing at the right time
 wo kam bolte hai lekin jab bolte hai to unke ek bayaan ke kai shikaar hote hai
 This is why Lalu Yadav used to say that Nitish Kumar has teeth in his stomach, not in his mouth
 pet main daant hone kaa matlab he, bahut hi shaatir hona
 Nitish's statement also has many meanings
 sidhe taur par to yah kaha ja rahaa he ki nitish ne apane bayaan main vipakshi party kii taraf se lag rahe aaropon kaa jawaab diya he lekin kuch log maanate hai ki is ek bayaan se nitish kumaar ne argedy ke saath-saath apni sahyogi bijepi ko bhi saaf sandesh diya he jiske kuch netaa bihar main aksar sampradayik bayaan dete rahete hai
 Well, if we weigh the statement of Nitish Kumar with the weight of arguments on the scales of truth then the situation looks upside down
 nitish kumaar ke is bayaan ke agle din hi khabar ai ki gopalganj se metric kii pariksha kii lagbhag 40 hajaar kapiyaan gaayab ho gai hai
 The police have registered a case and investigations are on
 Bihar witnessing all time high Crime
 Rapes every month- 98murder every month- 233kidnapping every month- 725theft, Loot & Crime evry mnth-20120and No Headlines & Debates of Jungalraj from sponsored media who would have cried at the drop of the hat, had it been in RJD rule
 — Tejashwi Yadav (@yadavtejashwi)june 18, 2018doosraa bada maamla gaya se aayaa
 The news came that a person from Gaya in Bihar was tied to a tree and gang-raped along with his wife and daughter
 police ne is maamle main 20 logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 In the same month, a big case also emerged from Muzaffarpur
 yahaan sarkaar dwaara sanchalit balika grih main sharan lene vaali ladakiyon ke yon shoshan kaa khulaasa hua
 Police has registered an FIR
 kuch media reports main to yahaan tak kaha gaya ki is balika sudhaar grih se netaaon or adhikariyon ke yahaan ladakiyon kii supplai kii jaati thi
 Apart from this, six such videos from Bihar have gone viral in which some boys with girls were seen forcing, beating and abusing
 agar baat duusare 'si’ karpshan kii karen to bhi aisa nahin lagata ki bihar kii maujuuda sarkaar bedaag he
 The latest case of corruption by officers is of Vivek Kumar, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) of Muzaffarpur district of Bihar
 vivek kumaar ke sarkari awaas par do dinon tak chhapemari main baari maatra main cash baraamad kiya gaya
 Apart from this, in May, Tejashwi Yadav had made several serious allegations of corruption against the state Deputy Chief Minister and BJP leader Sushil Modi
 jiskaa na to sarkaar kii taraf se or naa hi susheel modi kii taraf se koi jawaab diya gaya
 Nitish Kumar came to Bihar politics with the slogan that his government would adopt a policy of 'zero tolerance' against corruption and it is said that in his first term he had also established good governance in Bihar to a great extent
 lekin dhire-dhire sthiti vahi dhak ke teen paat vaali ho gai
 In the campaign against corruption for the last one and a half decades, more than 1700 civil servants have not only been caught red handed bribing, but they have also had to face the wind of jail
 kareeb dedh darjan bade naukarshahon kii 20 karod se bhi adhik kii kaali kamai ko sarkaar ne jabt kar liya he
 Now the third 'C' means Communalism
 bihar main nitish kumaar kii asal ladaiargedise thi
 Nitish Kumar formed an alliance with the BJP to fight the RJD
 chunaav jite or paanch saalon tak sarkaar chali
 But in 2016, Nitish Kumar parted ways with the BJP and a grand alliance in the RJD-JDU
 chunaav jeet gaye lekin gathbandhan tut gaya or ek baar phir bijepi ke saath milakar nitish kumaar ne rajya main sarkaar banaai
 After the Bhagalpur riots in 1989, Bihar did not see a phase of communal violence except sporadic incidents
 chaahe nitish kumaar kii sarkaar rahi ho yaa lalu prasad yadav kii
 There was an atmosphere of communal harmony during the reign of both
 yah pehali baar he jab kaanoon-vyavastha par samjhauta nahin karne kaa daawa karne vaale mukhyamantri nitish kumaar bebas dikh rahe hai
 Communal tension was witnessed in many districts of the state on the occasion of festival like Ram Navami, which is always celebrated in peace
 is dauraan kai jagahon par aagjanee, do sampradaayon ke bich jhadap or kai dinon tak lagane vaale karfu ko rajya or desh ne dekha he
 Now the question arises why all this happened suddenly and whether Nitish Kumar's government handled the atmosphere properly
 is bare main rajya kii raajnneeti kii gahari samaj rakhane vaale varisht patrkaar rajendra tiwari ne kuch samay pehle bibisi se baat karte hue kaha tha, 'nitish kumaar ne saal 2005 se 2013 tak bhartiya janata party ke saath sarkaar chalaai
 But he never compromised on law and order
 bhaajapa se alag hone ke baad bhi kanvad yatra ke dauraan dange bhadakaane kii koshishen huin, par prashasan kadai se usase nipatata rahaa
 But for the first time it is happening that he is BJP, he is Nitish Kumar but action is not being taken
 ' The central government has approved the proposal to merge the railway budget with the general budget from the next budget session
 sarkaar ne rail bajet or aam bajet ko alag-alag pesh kiye jane varshon se chali aa rahi parampara par viraam laga diya he
 The tradition of presenting the railway budget separately from the general budget was started in 1924
 jaaniye, marjar se judi badi baaten or modi sarkaar ke is kadam kaa kya hoga asar
 
 
 1
 ab aagaamee vitt varsh yani 2017-18 ke liye saal 2017 main sirf aam bajet hi sansad main pesh kiya jayega
 In addition there will be an appropriation bill
 isse railway kii swytatta par koi asar nahin padegaa
 2
 vitt mantralay hi ab rail mantralay kaa bajet tay karegaa lekin abhi bhi dono mantralayon ke adhikaron kaa batanvaara baaki he or iske liye kya prakriya hogi isko bhi tay kiya janaa baaki he
 3
 aam bajet main railway ke laagat or gaiyr-laagat kharch kaa byoraa hoga
 4
 kendriya cabinet ne bajet kii puri prakriya main hi badlaav karne kaa faisla liya he
 Under this, now the date of presentation of the general budget will be earlier
 5
 It is agreed between the Ministry of Finance and Railways that the Rail Tariff Authority will be set up in the coming days for reduction and increase in fares
 6
 If the railway budget is merged with the general budget, then it will save about Rs 10,000 crore every year for the railways struggling with cash shortage
 kyonki rail mantralay ko yah rakam dividend yani labhaansh ke taur par dena padataa he
 7
 aam bajet main rail bajet ke marjar ke baad bhi rail mantralay ko nai railgadiyon or pariyojnaon ke elaan kii chhot hogi
 8
 vitt mantralay saatven vetan ayog kii vajah se rail mantralay par pad rahe baari bharkam boj ko saajha karne main bhi sahyog karegaa
 9
 donon bajet ke marjar ke baad railway ke rajasav ghate or puunji laagat ko ab vitt mantralay ko transfar kar diya jayega
 10
 rail mantralay ko ab vitt mantralay ke saamne gros bajtary saport ke liye gidgidaana nahin padegaa

 jise kaaphi pasand kiya gaya
 The cabinet has taken an important decision to make it easier to do business in India
 buudhvaar ko pradhanmantri kii adhyakshata main hui cabinet kii baithak main ye tay kiya gaya he ki petroleum or natural gas ke kshetra main Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy ke tahat biderse ko aayal blox ke aavanton kaa adhikaar petroleum mantri or vitt mantri ke paas hoga
 The comments bharat sarkaar ko ummid he kii is faisle se aayal blox ke aavanton ke bare faisla jaldi lenaa It will be possible and this will strengthen the ease of doing business in the country
 philhal aayal blox ke aavanton kii prakriya kaaphi jatil he
 For this, it takes a long time for coordination and consensus among different ministries after which the proposal has to be presented before the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs for final approval of allocation of oil blocks
 lekin ab ye faisla petroleum mantri or vitt mantri aapas main salaah mashvire ke baad le sakenge
 The Government of India is hopeful that this decision will soon take a decision on the allocation of oil blocks
 sambhav hoga or isse se desh main ease of doing business (vyapaar karne main aasaani) kii kavayad majboot hogi
 Currently, the process of allocation of oil blocks is quite complex
 iske liye alag-alag mantralayon ke bich samanvay or aam sahmati banane main lambaa vakt lagata he jiske baad prastaav ko cabinet kii aarthik maamalon kii samiti ke saamne pesh karnaa padataa he aayal blox ke aavanton ko antim manzuri ke liye
 But now the Petroleum Minister and Finance Minister will be able to take this decision after consulting each other
 philhal aayal blox ke aavanton kii prakriya kaaphi jatil he
 For this, it takes a long time for coordination and consensus among different ministries after which the proposal has to be presented before the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs for final approval of allocation of oil blocks

 It is not at all the case that women or men should be banned after marriage, that they will neither see nor talk to anyone other than their partner
 agar aisa he to ye puri tarah se galat he
 But if these are not limited to just seeing or talking, then of course there should be no hesitation in saying it wrong
 kisi ke prati aakarshan hona ek alag cheez he lekin us aakarshan ke chalate apni shaadishuda jindagi ko taak par rakh dena bilkul galat he
 However, before justifying any thing, it is very important to know what is the reason for that matter
 extra-marital afaire hone ke bahut se kaaran ho sakate hai lekin agar samay rahete un kaarnon ko jaan liya jaae to is musiibat se paar paaya ja saktaa he
 In most cases extra-marital affairs are caused by discord in married life, but this is not the only reason
 yahaan aisi hi paanch vajahon kaa zikr he jisaki vajah se extra-marital afares ho sakate hai:1
 Being married at a very young age, some people get married at a very young age due to family and society
 naukari hui nahin ki shaadi kar di jaati he
 When such people reach the next stage of life, they start feeling that they have missed a lot
 aise main ve extra-marital afaire kii ore kadam badhaane lagate hai
 2
 sexual setisphation na milane paraye bhi ek pramukh kaaran ho saktaa he ki aapkaa saathi aapke alaava kisi or ke prati aakarshith ho
 In many cases, this is the biggest and only reason
 3
 Trust in Extra Relationship While sex life needs to be successful in order to keep the marital relationship successful, there are some people who have craving for extra relationships
 apane saathi ke saath santusht hone ke baavjood ve duusare ke saath sambandh banane ke liye aatur rahete hai
 4
 achaanak se mohabhang ho jane parahaalanki aisa kam hi hota he par jahaan kisi rishte main tulana kaa bhav aa jaataa he, rishte bikharane lagate hai
 Suddenly someone else makes you look beautiful and your own partner ugly
 uske saare gun aapke liye avagun ban jate hai or duusare kii har choti-badi baat khubi lagane lag jaati he
 5
 bachche ho jane ke badjise hi koi joda maa-baap banataa he, unki jindagi puri tarah se badal jaati he
 Their priorities change and sometimes the way of living
 aksar aisi sthiti main purushon kaam apni patni se moh bhang ho jaataa he kyonki wo zyada vakt apane bachche ke saath hi bitaane lagati he

 Taapsee Pannu, Akshay Kumar, Manoj Bajpayee, Anupam Kher, Prithviraj, Virender Saxena and Danny Denzogpa are the lead actors of the film
 sabase pehle yah bataanaa jaruri he ki naam shabana ke vishay kaa janm film baby se hua he, jiskaa nirdesan niraj pandey ne kiya tha, naam shabana kii kahani shabana khan ke team baby main shaamil hone se pehle kii kahani he
 In the film, Shabana (taapsee Pannu) lives with her mother, she is proficient in martial arts
 us par desh kii ek suraksha agency kii najar padati he
 There is an accident in her life which changes the purpose of her life and at such a time she makes a deal with this security agency
 vah sauda kya he, kya shabana is saude ke liye taiyaar he, kya vah agency kii kasuti par khari utar paaegi? in sabhi sawaalon ke jawaab film dekhakar hi milenge
 You can decide whether to watch the film or not after this review
 tippaniyan Let's start with the shortcomings of the film
 film kii sabase badi kamajori he isaki kahani
 Because of the film being promoted as an action thriller, you go to see the film with the same expectation
 lekin madhyantar se pehle film main ection bahut kam dekhne ko milegaa
 The scenes created to give a thrill of long scenes, clear moments, and force, create uneasiness in you
 is film main montajon kii bharmaar he jo film kii avadhi ko lanbaa karte hai or kahani ke liye asardaar sabit nahin hote
 i think it is a good idea to create a different film on the previous life of a character of the film, but if the story was thought through deeply, it could have been a better film
 film kii ek or khami he iskaa becoground mujeec jo kaaphi laud he or drishyon ko sahaara dene se zyada shor prathit hota he
 The songs of the film are also weak which do not stick to the tongue
 ab film kii kuch khubiyaan
 The idea of the film is good in itself and the performance of Taapsee is well appreciated and the dialogue delivery is praiseworthy
 film main vah behad sahaj lagi hai, unka ection kamaal kaa he
 The impact of his hard work and practice in his character is clearly visible
 taapasi ke baad akshay kumaar apane abhinay kii chhap chhodte hai, film main vah behad kam samay ke liye hai lekin unki bhoomika damdaar he
 The action scenes of the film are effective, Prithvi's work is also good
 interval ke baad film behatar or adhik niyantran main najar aati he or film kii gati behatar ho jaati he
 This film from my side 2

 In the general election 2009, when Congress scored a double century of mps, Uttar Pradesh had a significant contribution with 21 seats in it
 yahaan congress arase baad apni sthiti sudhaar pai thi
 Plagued by erstwhile BSP rule, suspicion of SP and bjp's disastrous situation gave Congress a chance

 iske saath hi supreme court ne tribunel ke policy ko radd karne ke faisle ko palat diya he or sena kii policy ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 In fact, in the Indian Army, only the officers of a war-going unit like the infantry are promoted as colonels, whereas units like engineering units do not have this facility
 tippaniyan 2009 , was canceled by the Armed Forces Tribunal against which the Center appealed to the Supreme Court
 centre kii daleel he ki combat uniton main kam umr ke afasar rakhane ke liye ye kadam uthaaya gaya

 haalanki sunwaayee ke dauraan hi centre sarkaar ne kaha tha ki usne karnal ke 141 atirikt pad bhi bana rahe hai taaki iskaa laabh baaki unit ke logon ko bhi mil sake
 Along with this, the Supreme Court has overturned the Tribunal's decision to cancel the policy and upheld the Army policy

 The comments 2009 main banaai gai is policy ko armd forcej tribynul ne radd kar diya tha jiske khilaaf centre ne supreme court main apil kii thi

 However, during the hearing itself, the central government had said that it was also making 141 additional posts of colonel so that the people of the rest of the unit could also benefit from it

 ISRO (indian Space Research Organization - ISRO) scientists are constantly in contact with the Chandramayan-2 Vikram Lander on the surface of the south pole of the moon
 haalanki, chand kii sataha par vikram kii landing ke baad se ab tak 6 din biit gaye hai
 But he could not be contacted

 Despite this, ISRO, its scientists and the people of the country have not given up hope
 vaigyanik prayaas kar rahe hai ki sampark ho jaae or log prarthana kar rahe ki vaigyanik safal ho jaae
 Let's see how successful people's prayer and efforts of scientists are
 hamaare vaigyanik haare nahin hai
 Just the joy of victory has gone out of their hands for some time
 agar vikram lander se sampark nahin hua to kya hoga
 
 
 
 ye sawaal sabake jehan main he
 Let us tell you what is the future plan if ISRO scientist is not able to contact Vikram Lander in any way
 2
 isro's contact with Vikram was broken at 335 meters, not 1 KM, this is the graph
 Proof will be sent to Chandrayaan-3
 Confident sources of upgraded Vikram Lander and Pragyan Roverisaro have told that ISRO has started considering that if If Vikram Lander is not contacted, they will send the upgraded version of Vikram Lander and Pragyan Rover to Chandrayaan-3
 chandrayan-3 main jane vaale lander or rover main zyada behtareen sensors, taqatvar camere, atyaadhunik niyantran pranali or zyada taqatvar sanchaar pranali lagaai jaaegi
 It is also being said that a backup communication system can be installed in all parts of Chandrayaan-3 so that backup communication system can be used in case of any untoward incident
 let ho saktaa he antariksh main bharat kaa brahmastra, sargical strike main tha ahm rolajapan de saktaa he chandrayan-3 main bharat kaa saathaisa kaha ja rahaa he ki bhartiya spes agency isro ke chandrayan-3 mishan main japan kii antariksh agency jaksa (JAXA) bhi madad kare
 For this, he will use his most powerful rocket H-3
 haalanki, abhi yah rocket banaaya ja rahaa he
 For this mission, India will provide lander and orbiter and Japan will provide rocket and rover
 isse ummid jataai ja rahi he ki japan ke taqatvar rocket kii vajah se chandrayan-3 jaldi chand par pahonchega
 What kind of reward? Before Chandrayaan-2, the government will decide on the basis of data from ISRO scientists' salary Chandrayaan-2 Chandrayaan-3 mission
now, there is no discussion about preparations about Chandrayaan-3 in ISRO
 lekin, yah spasht kiya ja chukaa he ki chandrayan-2 se mili aankadon ke aadhaar par hi chandrayan-3 mishan puraa kiya jayega
 The probable date of Chandrayaan-3 was 2024, but now it seems that there may be a slight delay in this mission
 aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki isro duusari antariksh agenciyon se pelods banane ke liye kahe
