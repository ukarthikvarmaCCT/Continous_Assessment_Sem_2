 a terrible accident happened in Delhi, a mountain of garbage became a death and broke on a road in Delhi
 do logon kii jindagi kachare ke dher main dafan ho gai, lekin kooday se paidaa hua ye khatra sirf pahaad tuutane tak simit nahin he, is kachare kaa jehar dilli kii hawa main ghulkar naa jane kitne logon ko biimaar bana rahaa he
 The situation in Delhi today is similar to that of Seoul, the capital of South Korea, three decades ago, but Seoul not only got rid of its mountain of garbage which has reached dangerous levels, but also reduced the production of waste
 
 ab seol main kachare ke pahaad bananaa hi band ho gaye hai
 Like Delhi, Seoul was not finding a solution to his garbage problem, but when the problem was out of control, the lessons learned by Seol could also set an example for Delhi
 seol ne jo sabase jaruri kaam kiya wo kachare ko risource main tabdeel karke kiya
 In 1986, the largest landfill site in Seoul, Nanjido Parkura was left with no place, just as the landfill site in Delhi has not survived
 iske baad seol se sate inchon ilaake main nai site talash kii gai, lekin iske saath hi kooday ko kam karne kaa kaam yudhstar par shuru kar diya gaya kyonki seol prashasan ke logon ko ehsaas ho chukaa tha ki agar aisa nahin kiya gaya, to nai landphil site ko bhi kachare kaa pahaad banane main vakt nahin lagegaa
 According to an official of several types of wastewater resource recovery authorities for waste, Seoul launched a pay and throw scheme
 isamen khaas tarah kebegbanaae gaye, jo bazaar se maamuli keemat par kharide ja sakate hai
 These bags were made for different wastes, such as separate bags for wet i
e
 biodiggable waste, bags for industry, separate bags for raw material wastes and separate bags for heavy waste
 saath hi niyam ye banaaya gaya ki in bag ke bina koi bhi apane ghar, dukaan yaa santhaan kaa kachra nahin phenk sakegaa
 As a result of the methods adopted by delhiseol, learning Seoul is the result of the fact that Seoul today is named as one of the best cities to deal with waste because these methods not only reduce Seol by eighty percent of the waste reaching the landfill site
 , But has made it a useful thing
 dilli ke liye kachare ke pahaado ne khatre kii ghanti pehle hi baja di he or isiilie dilli ko seol jaise shaharon se sikh lene kii jarurat bhi he
 It is a matter of great use that garbage and garbage are struggling to empty their landfill sites which have become a mountain of Delhi
 tamaam prayog hue, lekin kamyaabi abhi tak nahin mili
 In such a situation, can Seoul's formula work in Delhi because Seoul has not allowed waste to be a waste, but has turned it into a raw material
 ab seol recoveri fecility kachare kii talash main rahati he kyonki seol main kachra process karne vaale plant ko har roj kachare kii jarurat padati he
 In the processing unit here, the waste from the houses is burnt at a temperature of more than 900 ° c and the construction material is prepared along with electricity
 yahi nahin jo kooda dilli main sadakon or landphil site par phenkaa jaataa he, vaisaa hi kooda seol apane plant main pahunchaata he, taaki use process kiya ja sake
 Decreased waste volume Five units were created to process waste in Seoul and were named Resource Recovery Facility, the name itself shows that the purpose of Seol was to recover waste from waste
 seol main paanch risource recovery fecility main 20 district ke garbej ko process kiya jaataa he
 Recycling here does not let harmful toxic gases get into the air, pollute water and land, and most importantly, the amount of waste dumped on the landfill site has been reduced by eighty percent, bringing the lifespan of the new landfill site to Seoul
 Has increased for fifty years
 behatar kachra prabandhan, matlab chakachak sadaken or chaurahechmchamati sadaken, saaf galiyaan or sundar chauraahey, kisi shahar kii khubsuurati main ye sari chijen chaar chand laga detii hai, lekin aisa apane aap nahin hota
 It requires will power, government efforts and the support of the residents living there
 in sari chizon ke talmail kii misaal dekhni ho, to seol main dekhie
 South Korea has left no stone unturned to make its city beautiful, Seoul is a densely populated city like Delhi, but in terms of cleanliness, there is no trace of garbage on the road
 logon kii di jaati he jaankarishahar ko saaf rakhane main seol ke garbej management kii bhoomika sabase ahm he or isamen ye baat bhi shaamil he ki seol ne apane logon ko kachare kii ahmiyat bataai he ki kaise kachra sadak par gandagi ban jaataa he or vahi kachra agar sahi jagah pahunchaaya jaae, to wo kitne kaam kii cheez ban jaataa he
 To tell and express this, the administration of Seoul calls its citizens to the garbage house
 jahaan games or dilachasp gatividhiyon ke jariye logon ko bataaya jaataa he ki kaise kooday ko kaam kii cheez banaaya ja saktaa he
 Garbage House equipped with hi-tech facilities The garbage house is also equipped with hi-tech facilities
 yahaan bacchon ko kachare kii ricikaling ke phaayde bataane vaale games hai, to bado ke liye swimming pool or aerobics jaisi fecility he
 The purpose is to call people to the garbage house and show what can be made from the waste and if the waste is not thrown in the right place, then it can become a trouble for the city for many years
 yahi vajah he ki ab seol ke log bhi kachare ko sadak par phenkane kii bajaae use sahi jagah pahunchaate hai or seol kii risource recovery fecility us kachare ko kachche maal kii tarah istemaal kar bijli se lekar tamaam chijen banane main istemaal karti he
 Waste handling measures in Delhi are not such that nothing has been done for garbage management in Delhi
 kai yojanaayen baniin, bahut si yojanaayen amal main laai gayi
 Some schemes are going on at present, manure is also being made from garbage and garbage is also being used for making electricity

 punjab vidhansabha kaa bajet satr ke pehle hi din akali dal ne punjab ke purv dijipi divangat capies gil kii shradhanjali ko lekar hangaamaa khadaa kar diya jiske baad vidhansabha kii kaarywahi ko kuch samay ke liye roak diya gaya
 Let us tell you that the budget of newly appointed Legislative Assembly of Punjab started from 2 pm on Wednesday
 yah bajet satr 14 june se lekar 23 june tak chalegaa
 In this session, the Captain Government of Punjab will present its first general budget on 20 June
 lekin satr shuru hone se pehle hi vipakshi partiyon aam aadmi party or akali-bijepi gathbandhan ne tay kar liya he ki kisaanon ke karj maafee, kisaanon kii aatmahatya, daliton par ho rahe hamale jaise kai muddon par punjab kii congress sarkaar ko gheraa jayega
 The ruckus started on the tribute of KPS Gill
 As the time came to pay tribute to KKPS Gilco in the session of the Punjab Assembly on Wednesday, the Akali Dal started creating a ruckus to express their opposition
 jiske baad kuch samay ke liye kaarywahi ko rokna padaa
 In fact, the Akali Dal has written a letter to Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh, demanding not to pay tribute to KPS Gill in the tributes paid before the commencement of the proceedings on Wednesday
 akali dal kii kor cameti kii meeting main ye faisla liya gaya ki buudhvaar se shuru hone vaale punjab vidhansabha satr ke dauraan divangat IPS capies gil ko shradhanjali naa di jaae
 Punjab KCM Captain Amarinder Singh also wrote a letter on behalf of the Akali Dal demanding that KPS Gill should not be allowed to pay tribute inside the House
 akali dal kaa maananaa he ki capies gil ne aatankwaad ke daur main kai begunaah sikhon kaa jhootha encounter kiya or unhen aatanki bataa kar maar diya
 For this reason, the Akali Dal does not want KPS Gill to be paid tribute within the Punjab Assembly
 duusari ore punjab vidhansabha main divangat IPS capies gil ko shradhanjali naa dene kii akali dal kii darkhwaast ko punjab sarkaar ne nakaar diya he
 Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Badal said that KPS Gill has done a lot of work against terrorism in Punjab and because of that, peace prevails in Punjab today and the Congress government does not agree with the Akali Dal and before the assembly session starts Tributes will also be paid to KPS Gill among the tributes paid
 punjab vidhansabha ke satr ke pehle hi hangaamedaar rahane ke asaar the or ab capies gil ko shradhanjali diye jane ke maamle par bhi ek or vivaad khadaa ho gaya jisase vidhansabha kii kaarywahi ko safaltaapurvak chalaa paanaa asambhav sa lagata ja rahaa he
 The farmer issue may also be surrounded by Captain Sarkar
 The biggest issue in the assembly session will be the debt waiver of farmers
 punjab ke kisaanon kii dailygation ne mangalvaar ko punjab ke governor ve pi badnaur se mulaakaat kii or memorondom dekar unhen bataaya ki kis tarah se congress ne satta main aane se pehle kisaanon ke karj maafee ke vaade kiye the lekin ab satta main aane ke baad congress apane vaadon ko bhul rahi he
 The farmers of Punjab made it clear that if the Punjab government did not make any major announcement regarding the loan waiver of farmers in the coming days and during the budget session to be held on June 20, then the movement will be started in the whole Punjab
 saath hi punjab ke kisaan 15 june ko dilli ke jantar mantar par hone vaale kisaanon ke satyagrah main bhi shaamil honge
 Though the Punjab government has tried to give confidence to the farmers that all possible help will be tried for the farmers in the coming budget, but the problem is with the farmers that one more government has promised to give relief to the farmers and waiver of debt
 Doing it and secondly, its economic status is also being given by the government, in such a situation, farmers are now less hopeful that they will get any major relief from the Punjab government She is supposed to kul milakar buudhvaar se shuru hone vaale punjab vidhansabha ke satr main punjab kii congress sarkaar kii mushkilen behad hi badhane vaali hai
 While on the one hand they will have to face the attacks of opposition parties Aam Aadmi Party and akali-bjp alliance inside the House, they will also have to face the anger of the farmers on the road

 On the other hand, the manner in which Lalu has argued that the Income Tax Department raided 22 locations in Delhi and Gurgaon has not raided any of his bases and is a rumor raised by the central government
 is par susheel modi ne kaha ki agar aisa he to phirarashtriya janata dalke gundon ne buudhvaar ko bhaajapa karyaalay par hamalaa kyon bolaa tha?

 ’’ ve punjab main apni anubhavheen party kii kamyaabi ke jariye thos ranneeti kii taiyaari main hai
 The party's success in Punjab is a direct result of double anti-incumbency factors, on the lines of the spectacular performance in the December 2013 Delhi Assembly elections
 25 april ko rajya main narendra modi kii dhuandhar reliyaan spasht taur par shiromani akali dal-bijepi sarkaar ke khilaaf naaraazgi khatm karne main naakaam sabit huin
 The Congress had to bear the brunt of the scams of the UPA government

 Thousands of Sikhs were slaughtered in the rioting following the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984
 tab se ek ke baad ek aane vaali congress or bijepi sarkarein peediton ko nyaay dilaane main naakaam raheen
 Despite its achievement in Punjab and many seats and large number of votes, AAP failed to make an impact in the entire country
 phir bhi dilli main vah 30 fisadi vot paane main safal rahi he
 It is different that despite getting such a large number of votes, he could not get a single seat
 yogendra yadav is baat se inkaar karte hai ki ab aap kaa bhavishya khatm ho gaya he
 He says the party's strategy is to increase its limited resources and focus on assembly elections one after the other
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘ham agle paanch saal main dilli or punjab kii tarah kam-se-kam 10 rajyon main kamyaabi hasil karne kii koshish karenge
 "AAP is now planning to play the role of an effective opposition, for which it will use its small presence in the Lok Sabha and its ability to stage demonstrations

 i am fond of him & proud of him like many of you
 Hope, wish & pray that the society would be able to distinguish all these sponsored issues & stand by Mr Anand Kumar at this stage, so that he is able to continue his mission of taking our nation to the top
 
 
 Jai Bihar
 Jai Hind! The lynching continues in one form or another - from physical to verbal to "rumoral"
 
 
 This time the victim seems to be our own hero of “super30-anand Kumar” - the genius, mathematician, guru, role model, pride of Bihar, pride of the Nation with years of successful teaching
 
 
 1> 2
 
 
 
 
 providing quality education selflessly & shaping his students in making it to the top academic echelons
 It seems he has been put under hindrance by some unrecognized people who've named his brand in a fake, fabricated issue with some unsubstantiated charges
 
 
 
 
 
 2> 3
 
 
 for their own vested interest, which has no connection with him or his vision
 Really wonder - aren't we damaging our own kids future (& in turn Bihar's future) by critising or maligning him
 i personally know him - am his supporter, well-wisher & admirer

 upi ke agra main patni kaa whatsap or kol record check karnaa ek pati ke liye kaaphi mahangaa sabit hua
 The angry wife attacked her husband with a sharp weapon
 hamalaa karne ke baad patni vahaan se bhaagane kii koshish karne lagi, lekin rishtedaaron ne use pakad kar police ke hawaale kar diya
 Police is investigating the matter
 jaankaree ke mutabik, yah maamla shanivaar raat jile ke kheragarh ke bhilwali gaanv kaa he
 The injured husband Netrapal (21) has been admitted to SN Medical College after his wife attacked him
 netrapal ke sir par kai taanke lage hai
 She was married to Neetu (19) in 2014, three years ago
 nitu kaa afaire kisi se hone kii vajah se donon alag rahete the
 Neetu came to her house in a family function last month, told by an injured Netrapal
 shanivaar ko usne apni patni nitu ko whatsap par baat karte dekha, to naaraaz netrapal ne nitu se uskaa phone maanga to vah bhadak gai or usko dur rahane ke liye kaha
 When Netrapala tried to get his phone, he got angry and attacked his head with a sickle
 netrapal ke pita rajeev singh ke mutabik, nitu kaa duusari jati ke kisi vyakti ke saath afaire he
 Neetu's family did not say this at the time of marriage
 is bare me pataa lagane par ladke ke pita ne apni bahu nitu ko is baat par sochane or netrapal ke saath jindagi bitaane ko kaha tha
 But Neetu did not listen, she continued her affair
 polisake mutabik, hamalaa karne ke baad nitu ne apane bwoyfriend ke saath bhaagane kii koshish kii, lekin netrapal ke rishtedaaron ne unhen pakad liya or police ke hawaale kar diya
 During interrogation, Neetu said that her husband attacked herself to trap her

 petrol-dijal kii keemton main lagaataar jari ijaphe ke baavjood kendra sarkaar tex main katautee karne se manaa kar rahi he
 The central government argues that this decision will cause major loss of revenue
 aise main kendra sarkaar ke paas aam aadmi ko raahat pahunchane ke liye kya vikalp he?india today ke sampadak anshuman tiwari ne kaha ki bharat sarkaar dashakon se apane kharch ke liye urja kshetra par nirbhar he
 This sector makes the biggest contribution to the government's earnings and with the help of this contribution, the central and state governments have increased their spending in the past decades
 lihaaja anshuman tiwari ke mutabik kendra or rajya sarkarein yadi aam aadmi ko raahat dena chaahati hai to unhen apane kharch main badi katautee karne kii jarurat he
 According to Anshuman Tiwari, 'we are stuck in the clutches of numerous' maximum government'
 jo bijli, petrol-dijal or gas sahit puure urja kshetra ko dashakon se ek damaghont tex niti nichod rahi hai
 This policy becomes fatal as the price of crude oil rises
 petro utpaadon par tex kii niti shuru se basir-pair he
 In the midst of the slowdown of crude oil, the Modi government further screwed it up by increasing excise duty
 GST ho lagu to 89 se 60 rupee litre aa jayega petrol, dijal hoga 50anshuman tiwari ne kaha ki ek taraf jahaan sarkarein petrol or dijal main ho rahe ijaphe ko dekh raheen hai vahiin vidhansabha chunaavon ko dekhte hue chhattisgarh or rajasthan main sarkari khajaane par boj daalate hue mobile phone baantne kaa kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 Governments (center and state) are comfortable about revenue in India and careless about spending
 unke paas desh main sabase zyada khapat vaale utpaada ko nichodpee kaa mauka maujuud he
 In addition to the political uneasiness surrounding the election, petrochemical products have always been a dreaded sample of tax on tax, making India the most expensive energy economy in the world
 na ghatie exise or waite, lekin yah to kar sakate hai:1
 The entire oil and gas market is in the hands of state-run oil companies
 paanchon petro companiyaan (oengisi, iosi, echpisiel, bipisiel, gail) sarkaar ko sabase adhik korporate tex dene vaali sheersh 20 companiyon main shaamil hai
 These companies pay 17,000 crores to the government every year
 kaa labhaansh detii hai
 Prices can be reduced by avoiding tax and dividends
 desh ke is hisse main miltaa he sabase sasta petrol or dijal2
 Taxpayers own capital in state-run oil companies
 agar public sector public kaa he to use is maukey par kaam aana chahie

 kyonki ek darjan se zyada superhiroj par baari pade is super villen kii kahani na pehle kabhi padhi hogi or na suni hogi!harsha sharma india today media institute kii chaatra hai or india today main prashikshu hai*** How do we see Gandhi? As the great ideal, as the greatest hero of freedom, as the great man of humanity or as the walking god on earth? Or see Gandhi as the mentality that murdered him? a hypocrite, a traitor, a Muslim, an anti-india, a British pitcher, a capitalist broker and a born enemy of Hindus? Today, when the country is celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, it is important to know the answer to these questions
 or in saare sawaalon ke jawaab ke liye aap gandhivadi chintak, lekhak, upanyaaskaar giriraaj kishor kii kitaab 'gandhi or samaaj' pard sakate hai, jo pichley 20-22 varshon main likhe tamaam unke akhabaari lekhon kaa sangrah he
 Distinguished as a Gandhi-thinker by writing 'pehla Girmitiya', senior Hindi narrator Giriraj Kishore has tried to understand and explain Gandhi from different angles with his articles, statements and lectures compiled in this book
 ye sabhi aalekh pichley kuch varshon main alag-alag maukon par likhe gaye hai; isliye inke sandarbh nitant samakaleen hai; or aaj kii nigaah se gandhi ko dekhte hai
 These articles also highlight the organized propaganda against 'person Gandhi' and 'idea Gandhi'; And the mind structure of the mentor who worships his killer has also been made a matter of concern and contemplation
 insaan kii vyaktigat mahattvakankshaayen jab shunya par pahunchati hai to vah vyakti sabase oonche shikhar par ja khadaa hota he, gandhi isaki sabase badi misaal hai
 He presented himself every moment for a new change
 gandhi bazaar main khadey rahe lekin bazaar se dur rahe
 Gandhi presented a new vision of freedom to the world and an absolutely unique weapon to fight for freedom
 satya or ahimsa ko puraani kitabon ke sade-gale pannon se nikaalkar gandhi ne angrejon ke top, talwaar, lathi or banduukon ke saamne khadaa kar diya
 Many felt this miracle, and many felt foolish
 lekin kehete hai naa ki insaan agar antaratma kii atal gaharaaiyon se kuch karne kii thaan le to duniya uske kadamon main jhuk jaati he
 This is what Gandhi did
 bharat kii aazaadee duniya ke saamne ek nazeer ban gai
 Former South African President Nelson Mandela has written in his autobiography that he does not agree with Gandhi on many things, but he has no other way than to follow the path given by Gandhi
 gandhi ke jivan or virodhabhaason ko dekhen to kaha ja saktaa he ki unka vyaktitv or darshan ek satat banati hui ikai tha
 An under construction building that was in operation at every moment
 unka jivan bhi prayogshaala tha, man bhi
 Gandhi as a concept meets us as a sutra in the same way as Marx; It is up to us to understand our present and future with that formula
 yahi vajah he ki goli se maar die jane, bich-bich main unhen apraasangik siddh karne or jane kitni aitihaasik galatiyon kaa jimmedaar tehraae jane ke baavjood ve bache rahete hai; or rahenge
 They would still be after the domination of the forces that killed them
 ve koi puri likhi ja chuki dharm-pustika nahin hai, ve jeene kii ek paddati hai jiskaa anveshan hameshaa jari rakhe jane kii maang karata he
 Giriraj Kishore has responded to the questions raised on Mahatma Gandhi in the midst of the passing darkness of the twentieth century and his objectionable shadow in the 21st century
 unhone kahin gandhi kaa bachaav nahin kiya he
 Anyway, Gandhi can neither save anyone nor can drown anyone
 gandhi to satat yatra kaa naam hai
 The traveler who has faith in Gandhi, may follow along
 jisko nahin he, vah bhi der-saber gandhi ke raste par aane ko majaboor hua
 After all, it has become respectable for Gandhi in the RSS and BJP today, so behind this is the heart of Gandhi, which takes many a long time to understand
 mahatma gandhi ne 40 saal kii umr main likhi thi hind swaraj
 That book is the basic mantra of sustainable development
 giriraaj kishor ne agar hind swaraj kii praasangikta ko aadhunik sabhyataa kii kasuti par kasne kaa prayaas kiya he to gandhi ke naam par ho rahe asaty ke prayog ko bhi pesh kiya he
 You can definitely read this book published from Rajkamal once
 gandhi ko unke 150wein varsh main ateet kii taraf nahin, bhavishya kii taraf dekhne ke liye

 meri najar main singapore ke purv pradhanmantri lee kwan you is duniya ke shaayad aakhri loktantric taanashaah netaa the, jinhen pipuls ection party ke netaa ke taur par chah dashak tak logon ne chunaa or loktantric tareeke se taanaashaahee karne kaa mauka diya
 In return, he gave the people almost no freedom to speak less, limited religious freedom and to hold the fourth pillar of democracy in conversation
 logon ko munh band karke kaam karne kii aadat dalwai or uske badale main logon ko shantipurna tareeke se pashchim kaa vaibhav or purv ke lajij vyanjanon kaa swaad mila
 After reading something about him, instead of being influenced by him, in my mind his image became that of a powerful but sly leader, which is probably somewhat closer to yesterday's Indira Gandhi and today's Narendra Modi
 jo dikhaave ke liye loktantric mulyon kii duhai dete hue kathorta se apane nav udaarvaad ke model ko lagu karwaanaa chaahate hai
 Li Quan Yu used to call India not a country, but a group of 35 countries that settled near Britain's railway line
 isamen koi shaq nahin he ki lee kwan singapore kii hi tarah samaajwaad or navaudaravaad ke ek ajeeb ghalmail kii paidaaish the
 He was probably also because he was a Chinese by birth and grew up in the shadow of Britain, a staunch supporter of the practical capitalist
 wo janata ko samaajawaadee anushaasanamak tareeke se haankate rahe or singapore kaa vikaas poonjivadi tareeke se karte rahe
 He was the first leader to support Indira Gandhi's Emergency in order to keep the public disciplined
 unka is baat ko lekar khaasaa aagrah rahata tha ki bharat ek mahaan desh he, lekin ye apane ko mahaan banane kaa avasar teji se ganvaa rahaa he
 Li Kwan Yu liked India, but also disliked the bureaucratic systemic structure to the extent of hatred
 unka kahana tha ki bharat ke naukarshah apane ko suvidha dene vaala nahin, balki niyamon ko lagu karwaane vaala maanate he
 This is where the fundamental fault in the institutional structure begins
 wo kehete ki udyogpatiyon ke bare main acchhee soch kii bajaay kisi tarah paisa anthne kii soch zyaadaatar naukarshahon main rahati he, jo kisi bhi desh ke vikaas kii raah main ek bahut bada roda he
 However, many Indians will surely tell you that they prefer to do well in the polluted environment of Delhi rather than the stifling disciplinary life of Singapore
 lekin hamen ye jarur maananaa padegaa ki wo ye sari baaten kehane ke liye isliye hakdaar the, kyonki 1965 main britain se aazaadee milane ke baad unhone jhanjhaavat se apane desh ko nikaal kar ek chamchamaate vitt bazaar main tabdeel kar diya tha
 For which he does not have any heavy army or safety shield, it is astonishing in itself
 hamen unase raajnneetik vyavahaarwad ke anushaasan ko kuch had tak seekhney kii jarurat he, tabhi loktantric mulyon ko bheedtantr ke khataron se bachaaya ja saktaa he
 Otherwise, we can only cry out about the plight of our country amidst narrow political thinking and concocted stories of big dangers, but will not be able to take drastic decisions for the development of the country

 The comments subah jab gharavaale uthe to nalon main pani nahin tha, iske baad big bos ne gharavaalon ko 'jab tak tere paanv chalenge' task se avgat karaayaa
 Under this task, the home challengers had to paddle on two consecutive bicycles
 iske badale gharavaalon ko gas, pani, lages room yaa neend main se koi ek suvidha hi mil sakati thi
 For this, Bigg Boss appointed Priyanka Jagga as the director and she was told that if she can get this job done well then she can become a contender for the captivity of the house

 After this, Bigg Boss introduced the task 'for captivity in captive water'
 is task ke tahat rohan mehara ko chhodkar sabhi gharavaalon ko ghar ke ek sadsy ke naam kaa test tub diya gaya
 Bigg Boss instructed that the housemates would empty their test tubes one by one when the gong (a buzzer of sorts) sounded
 jis sadsy ke naam vaala test tub khaali kiya jayega vah captain banane kii res se baahar ho jayega
 Therefore, before emptying the test tube, the householder has to give the appropriate reason
 priyanka ne manu se kaha ki vah nitibha ke naam kaa test tub khaali kar de is par nitibha se unki bahes ho gai
 During this, Om Swami started crying and pleading with the family that he was his life to make Priyanka the captain

 nitibha ne manu ko apane paksh main karne kii koshish kii lekin vah nahin maane or unhone aglaa gong bajte hi nitibha ke naam vaala test tub khaali kar diya
 In the night, Manu refused to eat Priyanka's handmade food, saying that he will not eat Priyanka's food while he is at home
 manu ne kaha ki vah priyanka harkaton se thak gaye hai
 Late at night, the challengers once again started cycling so that the householders could sleep
 lekin bahut zyada thakne ke baad bani naaraaz ho gayi ki gharavaalon ko koi fark nahin padataa ki ve log unke liye pis rahe hai
 Bani said that the task manager is sleeping, he also said that despite his birthday, the family members did not treat him well

 While forming the committee, the government had told the court that it is serious about the enforcement of rules through law on the indiscriminate use of personal information and hence there is no need to make privacy a separate fundamental right
 sarkaar kaa najariya chaahe jo ho, samiti ke liye yah lajimi tha ki vah is baat kaa khyaal rakhti ki adaalat ne vyakti ko taqatvar banane par jor diya he or uski bataai gai sanvaidhanik guarantiyon ko vah myne detii
 But instead that the committee aims to make the individual the owner and owner of its data, it is intent on seeing the government as helpful in promoting the digital economy
 siforeeshon ke bare main samiti kii samaj uski report ke pehle adhyay se hi jaahir ho jaati he, jiskaa sheershak he 'e free and fere digital iconomi'
 This chapter calls for an 'indian approach' to data security that is based on the country's development needs
 yah kahata he ki navachaar (innovations) or sevaayen dene kii khatir niztaa par paabandiyaan jaruri ho sakati hai
 It reminds of the government's plea in the court, in which it said that the rights of the person should be taken back for the welfare of the people
 ahm baat yah thi ki adaalat ne yah daleel khaarij karte hue kaha tha ki nijee swatantraaaen logon ke saamaajik phaayde hasil karne kii anivaary purv shart hai
 The report also does not make any real attempt to explain the reason for its deviation from the (basic) rights-based approach to data security
 vah bharosemand dhang se yah nahin bataati ki niztaa par (atirikt) paabandiyaan kyon jaruri ho sakati hai
 She mistakenly believes that innovation or innovation are possible only at the cost of privacy
 nateeja yah he ki uske masauda vidheyak kaa hashr nijee adhikaron ko kamjor karne or surakshaswachon ko nikaal phenkane main hota he
 For example, the report lays great emphasis on the use of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for shared well-being
 badi taadaad main nijee data ko process karke vyaktiyon kii andhadhundh profile banaai ja sakati hai
 While the purpose of AI is to enable machines to make arguments and decisions, the general opinion among scholars is that there is a high probability of making mistakes in those results, which may lead to discrimination and other kinds of damage
 vidheyak main niztaa ko nuksaan pahunchane vaali ek or baat bharat main tamaam nijee data kii prati rakhane kii jarurat he
 This is clearly reflected in the desire to build digital infrastructure in the country, but this provision leaves private data vulnerable to even more security threats and is exposed to government spying
 jasusi or nigaraanee kii ijaajat dene vaale bharat ke kanoonon ko dekhte hue is praavdhaan kaa durupyog nagarikon—masalan, sarkaar ke kaamon par sawaal uthaane vaale virodhiyon—ke khilaaf kiya ja saktaa he
 Interestingly, the committee acknowledges the lack of effective controls (such as interrogation or written communication intervening before judicial approval before interrogation) in India's surveillance system, but it still retains the data indigenously Advocates dismiss these concerns
 philhal hamaare paas sarkaar or companiyon se apni baatcheet or kaamkaaj kii nijee jaankaree ko chhod dene ke alaava koi chaara nahin he
 It would have been nice had the committee valued personal freedom over vague notions of innovation
 ummid karen ki sarkaar in khaamiyon par vichaar karegi or ek aisa vidheyak paarit karegi jo buniyadi adhikaron ko vaaki majbootee de sake

 Senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said at a press conference here today that the Congress Party has discriminated against awarding Bharat Ratna to the leaders of the country and their view in this matter has not progressed beyond a family
 prasad ne sawaal kiya ki kyon abhi tak purv pradhanmantri vaajapeyi ko bharat ratna nahin diya gaya or swatantraaa sangram senaanee sardaar vallabh bhai patel ko deree se bharat ratna diya gaya
 He said that the first Prime Minister of the country Jawaharlal Nehru was the Prime Minister of the country for 17 years, Indira Gandhi for 15 years and Rajiv Gandhi for five years and during this time many other people were honored with Bharat Ratna
 lekin sardaar patel ko unke nidhan ke 41 saalon baad bharat ratna se sammanit kiya gaya
 Prasad said that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the most popular Prime Minister till date and he had contributed to make Chhattisgarh but he has not yet been given Bharat Ratna

 The Delhi Police's squad of investigative dogs is busy playing in the field instead of training
 pehali nazar main yah nazaaraa aap ko atapata sa lagegaa
 The reason for this is that often these dogs are seen training in the field or looking for important clues in an incident
 haalanki ab sawaal yah uthta he ki yanha ye training kii jagah khelkud main kyon mast he? kyon dogs maidan main puri tarah se masti ke mood main he? kyon inke trainer inhen training dene kii jagah inke saath khel rahe he?daramil, aajkal dilli police dogs squad ke dogs trainurs ke nirdeshon ko nahin maan rahe hai, balki trainrsin kuttonko unki marji ke mutabik ghumaate hai
 So when they want to play, these dogs play
 vajah yah he ki dilli main pad rahi bheeshan garmi kii vajah se ye kute anofitial chuttee par he
 Due to the heat, dogs are not being trained nor are they included in routine exercise
 saath hi inke khaane pine kaa bhi khaas khyaal rakhaa ja rahaa he
 Dogs are kept in dogs squad canals
 yedogs dinbharkai routine duty main shaamil rahete hai or puure din training or duty main lage rahete he, lekin aajkal inako aaraam hi aaraam he
 If there is a very serious incident in Delhi, then only they will be sent there
 haalanki dilli main dopaher ke vaqt kaaphi garmi rahati he
 In such a situation, it also affects their working style
 dilli police kaa ye dogs squad suraksha or aparaadhiyon ko pakadney main ahm bhoomika nibhaataa he
 These dogs play an important role in getting unclaimed items somewhere, checking the VIP route and putting the criminal's clue on the crime scene and throwing water on the nefarious plans of the terrorists
 inhen jo task diya jaataa he, use ye bakhubi anjaam tak pahuchaate hai

 Savitri was undergoing treatment for her son Devraj for a long time
 lekin vah thik nahin ho paaya
 He had also taken loans from many relatives and experts for the treatment of the son
 ab uske paas ilaaj ke liye paise nahin the
 Eventually, Savitri, after getting upset with the child's sickness, strangled her to death at home
 iske baad vah apane bachche ko lekar rajawadi aspataal gai

 With the Muslims accepting good conditions in Gujarat, Vastanvi, however, refused to comment about the state's Chief Minister Narendra Modi and said that he was chosen by the public
 vastanvi ne gujarat ke musalamaanon ke halaat se jude sawaal par kaha, ‘meraa yah maananaa he ki gujarat ke zyaadaatar musalmaan khushhaal hai
 Most Muslims in the state are happy with their work, except for a few people who are surrounded by some or the other matter
 unke aarthik halaat bhi achche hai

 Ask the public how Modi and his government are

 When asked about the 2002 riots in Gujarat after the Godhra carnage, he said, "muslims have to leave it behind and move forward

 i will not say anything further because the court will decide on this
 vaise bhi main is dange ke bare main zyada kuch nahin jaanata kyonki maharashtra main rahata hum
 In the context of the debate on 'hindu terrorism' these days, Vastanvi said, 'look, anyone involved in terrorism should be punished
 aatankwaad ko koi naam nahin dena chaiye
 i definitely say that Hindus, Muslims and all sections of the country will have to stand up against terrorism
 yah hamaare mulk ke liye bada khatra he
 Regarding BJP President Nitin Gadkari's campaign to connect Muslims with Muslims, he said that this is purely a political matter, so he would not give any opinion on it
 vastanvi ne kaha, ‘main jis pad par hum, vahaan se koi raajnneetik bayaan nahin de saktaa
 i will not speak in favor or opposition of any party

 President Barack Obamane said at a summit at the White House on the subject of combating violent extremism that the US and its allies fight not against Islam but against those who have misinterpreted religion
 obama ne kaha ki iesael or al kaayda jaise samooh khud ko dharm kii hifaazat karne vaale pavitra yoddha bataate hai
 They try to show up as religious leaders and holy warriors defending Islam

 corbett tiger rigerv park ke 214 baagh vanyajeev taskaron kii ankhon main khatak rahe hai
 While the number of tigers in the world is declining rapidly, Corbett recorded a one-fourth increase in the number of tigers during the last census
 2008 main corbett main jahaan 164 baagh the, vahiin 2010 main yah sankhya badhkar 214 ho gai
 Corbett Park is the most densely populated area of tigers in the world
 baaghon kii yah badi aabaadi ab unke liye musiibat ban gai he, jo baavariyaa giroh ke alaava haryana or maharashtra ke vanyajeev taskar girohon ke nishane par hai
 During the last one month, nine tigers including five cubs have died in Corbett, out of which three tigers were killed by wildlife smugglers
 24 may ko park kii dhela range ke sawalde beet main vanakarmiyon ne kai fande or baagh kaa maance baraamad kiya
 But two smugglers escaped in the meantime, then on 28 May, foresters recovered tiger meat and intestines in the Bijrani Zone, considered safe by Corbett
 yahaan se vanakarmiyon ko tent, pani kii bottlen or khaadya saamagree bhi mili
 Within four days, tiger intestines recovered in two forest ranges showed that smugglers were active within Corbett
 vijarani range main baaghon ke baraamad angon ke paas pade maharashtra main nirmit saamaan se bhi yah saaf he ki corbett main maharashtra ke giroh sakriy hai
 The smugglers killed eight tigers in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand during a week and a half
 isamen se teen baagh uttarakhand ke corbett park main, do baagh maharashtra ke taadoba tiger rigerv main or teen upra ke dudhwa or pilibhit wanon main maare gaye
 It has been reported that an international wildlife smuggler gang has given contract to hunt 25 tigers to smugglers from Maharashtra
 uttarakhand ke pramukh van sangrakshak (vanyajeev) es
 s
 sharma ne is baat kii pushti kii
 He says, "the department has received information from SMS to give betel nuts to tigers, which are being investigated
" ''ab tak corbett prashasan maharashtra ke giroh kaa koi pataa nahin laga paaya he, lekin 6 june ko corbett kii esaoji team dwaara vijarani range main giraftaar kiye gaye haryana ke taskar giroh ne jo khulaasa kiya he, uske mutabik is baar unki yojana corbett ko baghaviheen karne kii thi
 The arrested Ramesh Bagdi of Pinjore, Haryana, Tarachand Bagdi and Ginia Bagdi of Panchkula said that they have been active in the park since May 20
 esaoji team ne unke paas se vanyajeevon ko fansaane vaala kadka, tripal or khodne ke aujaaron ke saath kaaphi maatra main khaadya padaarth jabt kiye
 Dariya, the leader of the smugglers, who stood near the Gularghatti crematorium on the banks of the Kosi river, escaped with five other smugglers during the operation
 park prashasan baaghon kii suraksha main naakaam hone ke baad unki taskari se judi khabaron ko dabaane ke liye bhi utsuk rahata he
 The park not only tried to hide the case of the three tigers killed, but also gave false information to the authorities in this regard
 jab neshnal tiger conjarveshan athurity (antisie) ke sachiv rajesh gopal or sadsy vijendra singh 5 june ko corbett ke pratibandhit kshetra main avaidh rup se banaai gai jamood sadak kii jaanch karne pahunche to unke saamne bhi park prashasan ne baaghon se sambandhit ghatnaon ko chipaaya
 Even during this period, removal of tiger limbs and remains from both the places was done along with erasing the marks of the shoes of the poachers
 iske baavjood sawalde beet pahunche antisie sadsy ne vijendra singh ne kaha, ''lag rahaa he ki baaghon kaa shikaar hua he
 The state government should investigate this matter with a senior officer so that the picture can be clear
 ''corbett park ke nideshak ranjan mishra vahaan hui teen baaghon kii maut se inkaar karte hai
 "there has been no tiger poaching within the park," he says
 park main ek giroh ke sakriy hone kii soochna thi, jise giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 "but Mishra also says that protecting 1,300 sq km area is not easy
 vah bhi tab, jab duniyabar ke taskaron kii nigahen baaghon par tiki hon
 One of the reasons for increasing infiltration at the international level Corbett Park is the lack of forest guards
 park ke liye vanarakshakon ke 139 sweekrut padon main se 72 pad khaali hai, jabaki 35 anya ko vibhageeya adhikariyon ne apane karyaalayon main lagaaya hua he
 The security of an area of 520 sq km is solely responsible for 32 forest guards
 itnaa hi nahin park kii suraksha vyavastha sanbhaalane vaale in vanarakshakon ke paas suraksha upkaran ke naam par sirf ek danda hota he
 Anand Pant, a jawan of the Tiger Protection Force, died on 2 June while on patrol in the Bijrani range and the Corbett administration is comforting
 ranjan mishra kehete hai, ''tiger protection force ke gathan kii prakriya antim charan main he
 Soon 112 new guards will be appointed
 baaghon ke shikaar kii gunj 4 june tak chale vidhansabha satr main bhi sunai di
 Leader of Opposition Ajay Bhatt said that the death of 22 tigers in the state within a few months is worrisome
 baaghon kii suraksha ke liye aavantit karodon ru
 The budget is also not effective
 pipuls for animals kii sachiv gauri maulakhi ne dijipi vijay raghav pant ko patr likhakar saaf kaha he ki corbett se lage kshetron main ek-do nahin, balki chah shikari giroh sakriy hai
 "the injured tiger had been roaming in Corbett since May 20, but was taken to the Nainital Zoo on May 25, where he died due to lack of treatment," says Gauri
 '' wild life protection socity of india ke rajendra agarwal kehete hai, ''corbett main dedh saal main 35 baaghon kii maut hui he, par prashasan or vanvibhag daawey karte nahin thak rahaa
 '' chhattisgarh ke ambikapur jila aspataal ke mahila ward main stri rog visheshgy shipra shrivastav ne ek mahila kaa oparation kar uske pet se 35 kilo kaa gola (ovarian sist) nikaala he
 About two buckets of water were also extracted from the woman's abdomen during the operation
 chikitsika dwaara kiye gaye is safal oparation se mahila kii jaan batch gai
 According to the doctor, this is the biggest case so far in a district hospital, in which a weight ball (ovarian cyst) has come out of a woman's stomach
 soobe ke balrampur jile ke sanaval nivasee bifal khairavaar kii patni shivbasia (35) ko gambhir sthiti main pet phool jane ke kaaran paanch farvari ko jila aspataal ke mahila ward main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 When Shipra Srivastava started his treatment, it was found that there is a huge ball in his stomach which is fatal to the patient's life
 chikitsika ne puri jaanch ke baad guuruuvaar ko mahila kaa oparation kiya or 35 kilo ke gole ko baahar nikaal diya
 About two buckets of water were also taken from the abdomen with the shells
 oparation ke baad mahila kii haalat ab khatre se baahar he
 The doctor said that women often have a circle in their stomach but its size varies from half a kilo to unlimited

 He said the vibration level in the record has come to less than a quarter of the safe limit

 He assured that the corporation hired the best available design consultants providing their professional expertise to contractors
 unhone kaha ki metro sevaayen carbon padchihn or pradooshan ko kam karne main madad karti hai, or harith jan rapid transit system kaa gathan karti hai
 This metro will reduce the increasing load on the local rail, mostly due to congestion, it is going to be a 'game-changer' in the transport scenario in the financial condition of the country

 joya apane lack ke bare main bataati he or ittefaq se jis din wo unke saath brakefast karti he to team india jeet jaati he
 But Nikhil believes in karma, not luck
 bas yahi takaraav donon ke ishk or jindagi main kai tufaan laa detaa he
 The story of 'the Zoya Factor Film Review' is very simple and natural
 film main jagah-jagah kamedi ke joardaar panch he, or dressing room kii kai baaten hai
 Then many players of the cricket team also remind the players of the Indian cricket team
 cricket match ke seen mjedaar hai, diarector abhishek sharma kaa focus cricket ke jariye thrill paidaa karne kaa rahaa he, or cricket match ke peeche kii camentry bhi mjedaar he
 Although many things in the story seem quite unreal
 abhishek sharma isse pehle 'tere bin laden' or 'da shaukeens' or 'parmanuh da story of pokharan' jaisi filmein bana chuke hai
 Abhishek Sharma has not kept much melodrama regarding Ishq
 haalanki film kii kahani kaaphi obvious he, lekin kamedi panch, or cricket seens ke jariye unhone bharat main dharm ban chuke khel ko achche se bhunaane kii koshish kii he
 Dulquer Salmaan is the life of 'the Zoya Factor Movie Review'
 dulkar salmaan kii acting or expreshans bahut hi kamaal ke hai or is film ke baad unki fain folowing main jabardast ijapha bhi hone vaala he
 With this, Sonam Kapoor has played her character well
 sonam kapur ke monolog kaaphi mjedaar hai, jo khub gudgudate bhi hai
 Sanjay Kapoor, Sikander Kher, Angad Bedi and Manu Rishi have also acted well
 lekin salaami ballebaaj shivi kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahe abhilash choudhary or tej gendbaaj harry bane gandharva dewan ko dekhnaa bahut mjedaar rahaa
 The message of the film is that it is cricket, played from 'luck' and not 'love'
 'da joya factor (the Zoya Factor Movie Review)' family antertainer he, jise ek baar dekhnaa to banataa he
 After the terrorist attack on the Amarnath pilgrims, it has come to light that there were many flaws in the security arrangements for this trip
 ajtak ko mili exclusive jaankaree ke anusaar shrin board kii website se online yatra parchi lene vaale zyaadaatar yatri suraksha niyamon kaa paalan nahin karte hai
 According to the information received by online slips, a lot of passengers who take online travel slips from the website, come directly to Jammu and Kashmir and take a private car and start traveling
 is tarah amarnath yatri shrin board kii website main die gaye niyamon kaa ulanghan karte hai
 According to the vigilance rules issued by the administration, now Amarnath pilgrims will have to follow the new rules
 amarnath yatra ko lekar jo yatri sidhe shrin board kii yatra parchi lekar tourist ke taur par nikal jate he, unki alag-alag jagah checkpost or naakon par checking kii jaaegi
 There will be a complete ban on passengers going out of the convoy
 isi prakaar jo yatri apni suvidha ke anusaar tourist banakar ghoomane-phirane nikal jate hai, un par bhi roak lagegaa
 According to the information received, the passengers themselves avoid traveling with the CRPF convoy
 ab yatriyon ke liye kafila main jane ke liye kade niyam ke tahat chalanaa hoga
 The unregistered trains which run for the Amarnath Yatra on the National Highway will have to be identified and taken to the nearest camp
 suraksha vyavastha kadiiis bich aatanki hamale ke baad amarnath yatra kii suraksha kaaphi kadi kar di gai he
 CRPF has doubled the number of its escorts trains
 ROP main lage javaanon kii sankhya 25 pratishat tak badhaai gai he
 10 Reserve Company of CRPF were deployed to protect the Amarnath Yatra
 yatra root par drone kii sankhya badha di gai he
 The number of blocks for checking unregistered trains has been increased
 CRPF aurajammu-kashmir pulicenaakon main electronic upkarnon ke jariye kadi nigaraanee karegi
 After 7 pm, more number has been increased to check the road domination team so that area domination can be done properly
 i am happy to inform that Father Tom Uzhunnalil has been rescued
