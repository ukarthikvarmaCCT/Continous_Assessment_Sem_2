 The third reason was that the family members of the accused had allegedly given bribes to the local police, so that they were not arrested

 NCP chief Sharad Pawar has surprised everyone by taking a role opposite his party leaders
 pavaar ne thane main do took kah diya ki iviem, haar kii vajah nahin ho sakati
 However, their leaders had taken a completely opposite role after the recent election results
 maharashtra main 23 farvari ko 10 mahanagar palika or 11 zila parishad chunaav ke nattejey aae
 In this, the graph of NCP fell in the power of the state for 15 years

 While the party topped the district council
 aakhirkaar ensipi ke party alaakaman sharad pavaar ne sabhi andolankaaree netaaon ko spasht kar diya ki apni haar iviem ke maththe madhne kii jarurat nahin he

 Pawar was speaking at the press conference held in Thane
 apana gussa nikaalane ke liye ensipi netaaon ne pune main iviem kii pratikatmak shavyatra bhi nikaali
 The agitating leaders alleged that the BJP molested evms
 jisase nattejey unke paksh main nahin aae
 As a result, BJP has performed better in 9 out of 10 metropolitan municipalities
 jabaki zila parishad main party sabase awwal rahi he
 Ultimately, the ncp's party high command Sharad Pawar made it clear to all the agitating leaders that there is no need to defeat evms
 haar aakhirkaar haar hoti he
 Take a lesson from him and get involved in work

 ' dilli chunaav ke nateezon ke baseravind kejarivalaneam aadmi partykaaryakartaaon ko ahankaar se bachane kii salaah di thi
 Then he gave the example of Congress and BJP and said that how the ego ruined both, everyone is watching

 Is there any difference between the struggle for ideas and the fight for supremacy? What kind of democracy, how much transparency? To say, the Aam Aadmi Party has been raising and promoting loudly the talk of internal democracy, Lokpal and transparency in functioning

 Kejriwal still continues on the road to success, even as his companions are left behind
 anna andolan ke ramlila maidan pahunchane se pehle hi rajendra singh or pivi rajagopal jaise kai soshal activist bich raste se hi alag ho gaye the
 These people used to say that Kejriwal does not listen to anyone, only does mind
 anna hajaare or kejariwal ke raste alag hone kii vajah bhi yahi rahi ki kejariwal party banane kii baat kar rahe the or anna sirf andolan tak simit rahanaa chaahate the
 Kejriwal continued on his way, Anna left behind
 haa, mulaakaat hone par rasm adaayagi jarur hoti he
 Kiran Bedi had also left Kejriwal long before joining BJP
 justise santosh hegade ne to pehle hi kinaaraa kar liya tha
 Some similar reasons for differences with Aruna Roy, who were with Kejriwal's early movement, are also said
 kya vaaki dur rahe kejariwal?yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan kaa kad chota kiye jane ke maamle main kya arvind kejariwal kii jaraa bhi sahmati nahin thi? aap ke andar machi uthapatak ke kai din baad, party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak se ek din pehle kejariwal ne twit kar afsos jataayaa ki party main jo kuch bhi chal rahaa he un baton ko lekar wo dukhi hai
 He also said that he will not fall into this matter
 sanyog kuch aisa hua ki kharaab sehat ke chalate wo kaaryakarini kii baithak main bhi nahin pahunch paae
 Technically, Kejriwal could not be considered to have any role in this action, but did he have any consensus in it
 kya virodh ke swar se kejariwal ko nahin balki baaki logon ko problem thi?kejariwal andolan ke raste raajnneeti main aaye hai
 Kejriwal's fight was with the system
 ab wo system kaa hissaa hai

 com / ijqol8thul ginni maahi, 20 varsh, gayika, activist, jalandhar, punjabajalandhar (puraane) kii kai sankari galiyon ko paar karne ke baad jab ham unke ghar pahunche to apane ghar kii cement vaali chat par baithi shahar kii ore takataki lagaae thim
 She says that when i think about the popularity of my songs, many times i am not sure
 punjab ke jatav samudaay se taalluk rakhane vaali ginni maahi kahati hai, "main vahi gaati hum jiske bare main maine badi shiddat se mahasoos kiya he
 i never craved for people to call me a star
 ''jahaan ek taraf zyaadaatar punjabi samakaleen sangeet puri tarah "jat'' gaurav or unki "bahaduree'' kii kahaniyon ke aasapaas ghumta he, maahi ke geet rosemara kii jindagi kii jaddojahad main barabari ke haq, mahila shashaktikaran jaise bade saamaajik vishyon ko gambhirtha se ukerte hai
 Mahi insists, "of course i insist on discrimination against Dalits, but the feeling of taking everyone along is an essential part of my songs
 yahi vah cheez he jo mujhe shrotaaon ke bade samooh ke bich pahunchane main madad karti he
 "mahi today is giving her performance not only in India but worldwide including countries like Greece, Germany, Canada and England
" maahi ke pita saamaajik kaaryakarta rakesh chander ne maahi ke jivan ko disha dene main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai he
 He realized the special trend towards music in his daughter at an early age
 rakesh kehete hai, "jab bhi radio yaa televijan chaalu hota, vah ram jaati thi
 We felt from the very beginning that our daughter is special
 ''do albamon, guraan di divaani (2015) or gurupurab he kanshi vaale da (2016) ke alaava danger chamaar, haq, fain baba sahib di, kii hoya je main dhi hai, jaise singles unke bade hit hai
 Mahi, a graduate from Hansraj Women's College in her city, does not agree that people prefer only dance numbers in Punjabi songs
 maahi kahati hai, "saamaajik rup se praasangik geet hameshaa logon ke man ke taar ko zankrut karte rahe hai
 "the young singer's dream of doing live shows from a young age of just eight years is to become a background singer in the Hindi film industry and pursue a doctorate degree in music
" baat pate kimunke zyaadaatar geeton, vishesh rup se fain baba sahib di or raaj baba sahib da ne kramshah 13 lakh or 12 lakh se adhik hit ke saath soshal media par tufaan machaaya he
 *** internet search ingine google ne apni bahuprachaarit soshal netwarking seva 'google plus' ko sabhi ke liye uplabdh kara diya he
 The company says that now anyone can take advantage of Google Plus
 ab tak yah seva pareekshan ke rup main keval aanmatran par uplabdh thi
 Accordingly, in the last 12 weeks, the company has conducted tests and many more have been completed
 lekin ab tak ke sudhaaron ke aadhaar par company beta varjan pesh kar rahi he
 It is noteworthy that Google introduced 'google Plus' in June
 google ne yah kadam soshal netwarking main fasebuk ke aadhipaty ko todane ke liye uthaaya he
 The company is also offering many new features like 'hangout' video features in Google Plus
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main sabase majboot partiyon main se ek hote hue bhi mayawati ne aakhirkaar kah hi diya ki chunaav ke baad agar spasht bahumat nahin mila to wo vipaksh main baithna pasand karengi, na ki kisi raajnneetik dal ke saath gathjod karke sarkaar bananaa
 No other party appears to be making such a statement among the major contenders for power
 bhaajapa ho yaa sapa-congress gathjod, do tihaai bahumat se kam par koi kuch bolne-kehane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Mayawati Shayad is the only leader who is taking this risk at a time when polling for 330 seats in six phases remains
 mayawati ne kaha- vipaksh main baithna manjuur lekin bijepi kaa saath kabhi naheepichley hafte jab pehle charan kaa matdaan puraa hua to bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne satta par daavedaari kaa bayaan doharaate hue kaha tha ki pehle or duusare charan main unka muqabla basapa se he or baaki ke paanch charnon main samaajawaadee party or congress ke gathbandhan se
 The intention behind saying this was that the anti-bjp vote was divided and the clash between the two factions to become a triumph for victory
 isse bhaajapa ko laabh mil saktaa he
 a confrontation with any one party or coalition will mobilize anti-bjp votes
 lekin is bayaan kii jad main ab apane ko duusare se majboot bataane kii pratispardhaa bhi samahit he
 It is very important for Mayawati to tell people that she is strong and that people should vote for BSP by believing in them
 mayawati aisa sthapit kar paaen, iske liye sabase pehle zaruri he ki apane chunavi sameekaran ko wo baandhe rakh paaen
 Mayawati's bet is on the dalit-muslim equation this time and she seems to be breaking into it
 muslim matadaataaon ke bich abhi bhi sapa ko basapa se adhik praathamikta mil rahi he
 The reason for this is Mayawati's history of alliances with BJP
 muslim matadaata ko lagata he ki siton kii kami padi to mayawati kahin phir se bhaajapa kaa saath lekar sarkaar na bana len
 If this happens, they will be cheated and that's why they are probably giving first priority to SP to avoid this situation
 mayawati agar keval jeet kaa dambh bharti raheen to andar hi andar muslim vot khisakta jayega or unke liye sthiti kathin ho jaaengi
 In such a situation, she needs to immediately explain that she will not go with the BJP under any circumstances
 bhaajapa ke saath samjhauta nahin, bhale hi vipaksh main baithna pade, aisa bayaan darasal soobe ke muslim matadaataaon ke liye mayawati kaa sandesh he taaki wo shaq or bhay se ubarkar unke liye vot kar saken
 If this happens, a negative-looking statement can create a positive picture for Mayawati
 zaahir he ki mayawati ke virdohi is bayaan ko unki haar kii sweekaarokti ke taur par dikhaane kaa kaam karenge
 But with this opposition attack, Mayawati will be seen as weak, weak and committed
 soobe main isbaar kaa vidhansabha chunaav mayawati ke liye khaasaa nirnaayak he
 It is very important for Mayawati to win this election from the point of view of her party, her leadership and the domination of Dalit politics in the country
 mayawati ise bhalee bhaanti samajhati hai
 And perhaps that's why he has played a big bet by telling them to sit in the opposition
 haalanki musalmaan unke is bayaan par kitna aitbaar karte hai, iskaa faisla 11 march ko matganana ke baad hi ho sakegaa

 2008 ke mumbai aatanki hamale ke baad bharat ne pakistan se jin 20 aatankwaadiyon ko use saunpane ke liye kaha tha usamen tunda bhi shaamil tha
 Additional Sessions Judge Neena Bansal Krishna acquitted Tunda, 73, of alleged offenses under TADA (terrorist and Obstructive Activity Prevention Act), Explosive Substances Act, various provisions of the Arms Act and Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC
 haalanki,tunda ko abhi jail main hi rahanaa hogaakyonki uske khilaaf ab bhi kai maamle lambit hai
 The Special Cell of Delhi Police had filed a charge sheet against Tunda in this case
 iske tahat 17 janvari 1994 ko paanch aropiyon ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha or uske paas se 150 kigra visphotak or chah kataar kathith rup se jabt kii gai thim
 The lower court in its order in December 1999 convicted the five accused Abdul Haq, Aftab, Abdul Wahid, Afaq and Afran Ahmed under the provisions of the Explosive Substances Act and Section 120B of the IPC
 police ne tunda ke khilaaf apane poorak aaropapatr main kaha tha ki adaalat use bhagoda ghoshit kar chuki he or vah bharat main aatankwaad ke vibhinn maamalon main shaamil tha
 Tunda was arrested by the Special Cell on 16 August 2013 from the indo-nepal border
 aaropon par daleelon ke dauraan, tunda kii ore se pesh adhivaktaa emes khan ne daleel di thi ki is maamle main koi saboot nahin hai or is maamle main giraftaar anya aropiyon ke kaboolnaamon ko unke muvakkil ke khilaaf aadhaar nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 Khan also said that there was no material to link Tunda with the alleged recovery of explosive material
 lok abhiyojak rajeev mohan ne daleel di thi ki visphotak saamagree adhinium ke praavdhaanon se jude maamle main doshi tehraae ja chuke anya sah aaropee kaa bayaan khulaasa karne vaala he
 The Special Cell of Delhi Police had also told the court that there is circumstantial evidence against Tunda, as 40 kg of explosives was recovered from his brother's house in Delhi, where he also lived in 1994
 -input bhashaa se After Jyoti Singh's killer Darindas was sentenced to death, defense lawyer AP Singh once again accused the government
 unhone sidhe grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia kaa naam lete hue kaha ki yah faisla sarkaar ke dabaav main liya gaya he
 After the verdict was delivered, Akshay Thakur's lawyer AP Singh appeared in front of the media and started his talk with 'a big regret
 lagbhag chillaate hue unhone kaha, 'grahamantri scindia ne 10 sitambar kii raat ko hi nyaayik adhikariyon se baat karke sab kuch set kar diya tha
 The judge, without ignoring the facts and witnesses, considered everyone as an equal accused and sentenced him to death
 yah puri tarah se sarkaar ke dabaav main liya gaya faisla he
 Challenging the society and the court, AP Singh gave a strange challenge to the court and the society, saying, 'I have three months to appeal
 agar mere muvakkilon ko faansee kii sajaa sunaae jane ke baad dilli or desh main rape kii ghatnaayen ruk jaati hai, desh badal jaataa he, to main santusht ho jaaunga or faisle ke khilaaf apil nahin karuunga
 But if it does not happen, then we will appeal in the High Court and we will wire this Judgment
 'is bayaan par sajaa bhi ho sakati havekil api singh ne khule taur par darindon kaa paksh liya
 His words were not only against public sentiment, but were also contemptuous of the court
 unhone kaha, 'dilli court puri tarah sarkaar ke dabaav main he
 This is a biased decision
 sabko pataa he ki 10 taarikh ke baad court kaa jajment badla gaya
 'experts believe that if the Supreme Court takes suo motu cognizance of his statement, then AP Singh may have to face the wind of jail
 api singh ne daawa kiya ki chaaron doshiyon ko pehle nyaay kii ummid thi, lekin 10 sitambar ke baad unki yah ummid tut gai
 He said, 'they were crying while coming here and on the contrary were telling me patience that this is bound to happen to us

 rajasthan main panchayat chunaav ke nattejey aa rahe he, lekin ek baat saafe he ki agar 2010 ke mukaable bijepi ne jila parishadon or panchayat samitiyon main apane ganit main sudhaar kiya ho to congress ne bhi unhen is baar acchhee khaasi takkar di he
 According to the results so far, BJP has 20 in 33 zilla parishad, while eight have got Congress
 chaar ke parinaam abhi aana baaki hai
 The total seats of the Panchayat Samitis are 6236, of which 2960 have been won by the BJP and 2490 for the Congress, but the figures to be considered in these trends are the vote share of the BJP this time compared to the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections
 in chunaavon ko congress kii vaapasi kaa darja dete hue rajasthan main congress adhyaksh sachin payalat ke mutabik, loksabhaa chunaavon main bijepi ko 55% vot share mila tha, ab 8 maheene baad vah 46% ho gaya he jabaki congress kaa vot share loksabhaa chunaavon main 30% tha, jo bad gaya he or 45% ho gaya he
 This means that the margin of victory between the BJP and the Congress in the panchayat elections has been just 2%
 bijepi kahati he ki vidhansabha chunaavon ke aankadon kii tulana panchayat chunaavon se nahin honi chahie
 From 1995 till now, bjp's vote share in rural areas has been increasing continuously and the result of Panchayat elections is only the trend of rural votes

 saath hi vishwabank ne yah bhi kaha he ki aane vaale varshon main desh kii vruddhi apni tej lay pakad legi or 7
 6 and 7
 8 fisadi ke str ko ek baar phir praapt kar legi
 a recent report by the World Bank said that the government's November decision to immediately remove large denomination notes has slowed economic growth in 2016
 haalanki report main kaha gaya he ki dhimi padane ke baavjood bharat kii vruddhi dar march 2017 ko samaapt hone ja rahe vitt varsh main ab bhi majboot 7 fisadi tak rahegi
 According to the World Bank, the impact of the reduction in oil prices and the concrete increase in agricultural products will reduce the impact of the challenges of cenotaph
 is tarah bharat china se aage nikal kar sabase teevr vruddhi kar rahi pramukh arthvyavastha bana hua he
 World Bank expects India's growth rate to be 7 in 2017-18
 6 fisadi or 2019-20 main 7
 Will reach 8 percent
 uskaa kahana he ki sarkaar dwaara shuru kiye gaye vibhinn sudhaaron se gharelu aapurti kii adchane dur hongi or utpaadakta badhegi
 Increased spending on infrastructure will improve the business environment and will bring more investment in the near future
 mek in india abhiyaan se desh ke vinirmaan kshetra ko madad milegi
 The sector will also benefit from improved domestic demand and regulations
 manhagaai dar main kami or sarkari karmchaariyon ke vetan maan main sudhaar se bhi vaastavik aay or upbhog ke badhane main madad milegi
 The World Bank has said that in the medium term of Kinotbandi there is an advantage that increasing the cash money with banks will help in reducing the interest rate and expanding economic activity
 lekin desh main ab tak 80 fisadi se zyada kaarobaar nakadi main hota rahaa he, ise dekhte hue notebandi ke chalate alp kaal main kaarobaariyon or vyaktiyon kii aarthik gatividhiyon main vyavdhaan bana rah saktaa he
 The World Bank has also expressed apprehension that the problems of closing old notes and replacing them with new ones are also a threat to the slowing of plans for other policy economic reforms such as GST and labor reforms
 notebandi kaa nepal or bhutan kii arthvyavasthaaon par bhi pratikul prabhaav pad saktaa he kyonki in arthvyavasthaaon ko bharat se mani order ke rup main kaaphi paisa jaataa he
 At the time of the elections held in 2014, it was promised to the farmers that their income would double by the year 2022 but even after 4 years the condition of the farmers has not improved
 tamaato utpaadan karne vaale kisaan hon yaa phir lahasun upjane vaale yaa phir pyaaj ugane vaale kisaanon kii baat karen, har koi pareshaan he
 The farmers say that ever since we started growing these crops, we have never been in such a bad condition as now
 haalat yah he ki tamaato or lahasun kisaan sadak kinare jaanwaron ko khaane ke liye phenk kar rahe hai
 The Khora Bisal area of sarna Dungar in Jaipur is known for tomato production across the country
 shaayad hi desh kii koi aisi jagah ho jahaan ke liye yahaan se trek bharkar tamaato nahin jate hai, lekin is baar haalat yah he ki kisaanon ke tamaato kheton main pak kar sad rahe hai or koi unhen kharidne vaala nahin he
 There is a camp of animals in the mandis, these days there is a camp of animals which is made near the farm
 bhed- bakriyaan, gaay-bhens yahaan par tamaato khaane ke liye jhund banaakar baithe rahete hai
 For several days, farmers do not have any buyers, after which there is no other way but to throw them in front of the animals
 kisaanon kii haalat yah he ki wo 1 se lekar2 rupee kilo takki keemat main bhi tamaato bechney ke liye taiyaar hai lekin koi unhen kharidne nahin aa rahaa
 Farmers 'crop is rotting in the fields
 Farmers' crop is rotting in the fields
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki jab se bharat or pakistan ke bich rishte kharaab hue hai unki haalat bhi kharaab ho gai he
 When the crop was high in the country, tomatoes used to go to Pakistan but Pakistan is border seized and tomato crop has grown so much in the country that there is no buyer
 darasal pichhali baar logon ne tamaato kii kam fasal lagaai thi kyonki uske achche daam nahin mili the jiske chalate inaki keemat kaaphi zyada ho gai thi
 Due to this, a good crop was produced after this but now its buyers are not being found
 tamaato utpaadak rameshwar yadav hai
 Those who have planted 3 lakh tomatoes in each bigha but are not earning even a lakh
 aise main 2 lakh kaa ek bighas ke hisaab seunpar karj chadh gayaahai
 Farmers who grow chilli are also worried, farmers who grow chilli, onion and garlic are also upset
 unka kahana he ki mirch koi ek rupye kilo ke bhav bhi nahin kharid rahaa or vah kisaan ke ghar hi kharaab ho rahi he
 Garlic is not getting even in the Kota of Rajasthan, there is a bumper yield of garlic and every time the farmer does not get the proper price of garlic
 aise main yahaan kaa kisaan lahasun ko phenkane par majaboor ho jaataa he
 Kota is Asia's largest market Bhamashah Mandi and here the farmer of whole Hadoti brings garlic but this time also the farmer is not getting the price of garlic
 bazaar main uskaa lahasun teen se chaar rupee prati kilo main bik rahaa he jo uski laagat bhi nahin he
 In such a situation, the farmer is not able to bring the goods to the market and is throwing it in the fields
 kota main 8 se 9 lakh metric ton lahasun kaa utpaadan hua he, jisamen se 1,54,000 metric ton lahasun bazaar hastkshep yojana ke antargat kharid karne kaa lakshya rakhaa jisaki keemat 3,257 rupye prati quintal nirdhaarit kii gai lekin iske liye kade maapdand rakhe gaye hai jisamen lahasun kii motaai 25 MM se adhik honi chahie or lahasun pilaa nahin, gathila ho
 Along with this, the farmer will have to register online and take a token in which he has been made mandatory of Bhamashah Card, Girdawari Report, Passbook, Aadhaar Card
 aise main kai kisaan yah aupchaariktaayen puri nahin kar paa rahe hai
 When farmers do not meet this criterion, they are forced to sell garlic at the rate of Rs 3-4 per kg in the market
 kota ke saansad om birla pichley dinon kendriya krishi mantri se mili the or lahasun kii bazaar hastkshep yojana main kharid kii baat kahi thi
 After that the Cooperative Minister announced the purchase of garlic from the market intervention scheme from April 26, but due to strict standards, farmers are not buying garlic in it
 abhi tak keval 1500 quintal hi lahasun kharida gaya he
 Farmer Rajendra Prasad told that he has brought 100 catted garlic, which he is getting Rs 1100-1200
 aise main wo use phenkane ko majaboor he
 He told that at such a price, he is not getting the cost price
 pyaaj bhi rulaa rahaa hacendre sarkaar kii ore se pyaaj kii lambaai nirdhaarit karte hue sarkari rate par kharid ke faisle ko lekar kisaanon main baari aakrosh he
 Farmers say that the central government is joking with the farmers by issuing absurd decisions
 35 MM kaa pyaaj kii lambaai nirdhaarit karte hue sarkari dar par kharid ke faisle kaa kisaanon ne aakrosh jataayaa or kaha ki pyaaj khet main ugta he factory main nahin banataa jisase isaki lambaai or chaudaai ko roka ja sake 
 Sikar is second to Nashik in the country after Nashik, where onion production in Sikar is bumper, but farmers are disappointed at not getting their cost
 sikar main pyaaj 5-7 rupee kilo main bik rahaa he
 The farmers have demanded the government to withdraw this decision, denying the 35 mm onion length decision

 ) imran khan pakistan ke nae pradhanmantri banane ja rahe hai
 Imran Khan held a press conference after winning the election data
 is press conference main imran khan ne satta sanbhaalane se pehle desh ke saamne new pakistan kii pariklpana kaa khaakaa khinchaa
 What has Pakistan become since the formation of Azad country and how will he create a new Pakistan during his tenure? But did Imran Khan's arguments just say that he had got the new Pakistan formula from India and that he was going to rely on the Chinese model to make that formula work? He did that he would take steps towards ending the mess with Pakistan for the last 70 years
 imran ne saaf kiya ki ab tak pakistan main satta ke ird-gird baithe logon kii bhalaai ke liye kaam kiya gaya
 As a result, today a large poor section in Pakistan has been deprived of basic facilities like education and health
 lihaaja ab vah raajnneeti kii bayaar ko is tarah palatney kii koshish karenge jisase pakistan main vikaas ke aankalan kii shuruyaat vahaan ke garibon kii sthiti ke aadhaar par kiya jayega
 Significantly, the story of bringing the poor to the center of politics in India's elections took place in the 1970s and continues to resonate until the 2014 general elections
 lekin is formule ko apnaane ke saath-saath imran ne yah bhi saaf kar diya ki pakistan se garibi hataane ke liye vah china kaa rukh karenge
 Taking lessons from China, he will work to bring the poor into the mainstream of development in his country
 imran ne yahaan tak daawa kar diya ki unki riyasat main kute ko bhi khaali pet nahin rahane diya jayega
 Therefore, the new Pakistan will be free from poverty
 nae pakistan kii pariklpana ko saajha karte hue imran khan ne daawa kiya ki ab pakistan main kanoon kaa bolbalaa hoga
 Along with this, emphasis will be given to the exercise to curb corruption in the new Pakistan
 is kaam ke liye imran ne sanket diya ki ab unke kaarykaal main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai ek kendriya agency dwaara ladi jaaegi
 The Prime Minister of the country and his minister will be placed first under the purview of this agency
 lihaaja, yahaan tak to imran khan ne bharat main chal rahi lokapal kii kavayad kaa formula apane desh ko sunaaya
 But after this, for example, Imran said that he would turn to China for this
 imran ke mutabik vah sarkaar kii kaman sanbhaalane ke baad china ke liye ek vishesh dal ravaanaa karenge jo china sarkaar se bhrashtachar par lagaam lagane kii baarikiyon ko sikh kar pakistan se bhrashtachar kaa safaya karne kaa bidaa uthaaegi
 However, Imran showed the contradiction by saying that his campaign would not be acted upon with political rancor
 lihaaja, ab yah dekhne kii jarurat he ki bharat ke liye is formule ko vah china ke model par bina raajnneetik vidwesh ke kaise aage badhenge
 Referring to Pakistan's current challenges, Imran Khan said that the biggest need of his country is a big investment
 is nivesh ke jariye pakistan main rojgaar ke bade sansaadhan paidaa kiye jaaenge
 By bringing new employment, the wandering youth in the country will be drawn into the mainstay of life
 is bade nivesh ko aakarshith karne ke liye pakistan ko apane ej of duing bijness index main bada sudhaar karne kii jarurat he
 After making this reform, he will lure immigrant Pakistanis to claim safe business in Pakistan, so that he can bring his investment to Pakistan instead of taking it to Dubai
 is puure formule ko samajhane ke baad imran ne do took kaha ki vah bade nivesh kaa rasta china ke bharose tay karenge
 According to Imran, on the basis of the ongoing China Silk Road project in Pakistan, he will bring big investment in Pakistan and put the country on the high-speed highway of development
 ant main imran khan ne kaha ki pakistan ek aisa desh he jo duniya main khayraat dene vaale 5 pramukh mulkon main shaamil he
 But people in Pakistan are not ready to pay tax to their government
 imran khan ne bharosa dilaayaa ki ab nae pakistan ko tex adaa karne kii jarurat he
 Imran assured that the tax given to him would be completely safe as he himself would guard the treasury of Pakistan
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki satta kii bagdor sanbhaalane ke baadaimran khanbharat ke in formule par kaise china ke model ko baithaate or puure santulan ke saath pakistan ko nae pakistan kii ore lekar jate hai

 bhagwaan jagannatha kii rath yatra shuru, jaaniye iske bare main sabakuchunhone bataaya ki is pul kaa istemaal kiya janaa jokhim bharaa ho saktaa he
 It was decided with this in mind
 yah pul tehri jile main tapovana gaanv ko nadi ke pashchimi tat par sthit paudi jile ke jonk se jodta he
 It is said that Lakshman, an important character of the epic Ramayana, crossed the river with the ropes of jute at this place

 Talking to 'aaj Tak' on Saturday, he said that PM Modi wants to deprive Muslims of the franchise through this law
 kyonki wo bhi samajhate hai ki palaayan ko khatm nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Those who have come here cannot be sent back

 i am confident that this law will fall in the Supreme Court in both equality and morality as described by the Constitution
 unhone aage kaha ki main hi nahin kai anya log bhi hai jo naagarikta kanoon ko asanvaidhanik bataa rahe hai
 i can even name three people- Soli Sorabjee, retired Justice Madan b Lokur and Santosh Hegde
 modi sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue chidambaram ne kaha ki wo saamne aakar bataaen ki unhen is tarah ke kanoon laane kii salaah kisne di? kya yah kanoonee vibhaag kii salaah thi yaa phir atorni general kii? aapako aisa kyon lagata he ki aapke kanoonee vibhaag ne jo kah diya vahi aakhri satya he?modi sarkaar par naaraazgi jaahir karte hue chidambaram ne kaha, 'is tarah ke kanoon banane main samay khapaane se behatar hota ki wo desh kii girti arthvyavastha, berogari or mob linching (bheed dwaara kii jane vaali hatya) se nipatane par dhyaan lagaate
 When Chidambaram was asked about the linking of NRC (national Civil Register) and the Citizenship Amendment Act, he said that the two are fully connected to each other
 donon kaa lakshya ek hi he muslimon ko baahar karnaa
 How can the Home Minister say that it is not a law to exclude Muslims? Implementing this law only means to exclude them
 puure vishwa main palaayan ko puri tarah se roka nahin ja sakaa he
 The history of the world is about to flee
 bharat main log baahar se aae hai
 Many of whom were illegal migrants
 lekin hamen us aitihaasik paridrishy ko bhi nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki log kis tarah ke halaat main palaayan ko majaboor hue
 They were all citizens of the same country earlier
 jo baad main do or phir teen deshon main bant gayi
 Chidambaram further said, 'there is an escape
 chaliye maan lijie ki ye sabhi avaidh pravasi he
 So they should have stopped only then
 aap mujhe koi ek udhaaharan bataa dijie jab pravaasiyon ko waapas bhej diya gaya ho
 US President Donald Trump could not do so
 aapako lagata he ki is desh se 19 lakh logon ko baahar kiya ja saktaa he?chidambaram ne aage kaha ki palaayan kar bharat aae logon ko waapas bhejnaa mushkil he
 Perhaps the government will identify the Muslims and end their franchise
 to bhi kya unase kaam karne, rashan card or aashray kaa adhikaar chin sakati he? ye sabhi maanavadhikaar ke daayre main aate hai
 The government can at most eliminate the right of these Muslims to vote

 sahitya ke kshetra main yogadan ke liye unhen duniyabar main kai puraskaron se nawaja gaya
 In 2008, The Times ranked Naipaul seventh on the list of 50 Great British Writers
 khaas baat yah thi ki is suchi main 1945 se baad kii kritiyon ko jagahon di jaani thi
 Some notable works by Naipaul include books such as In a Free State (1971), a Way in the World (1994), Half a Life (2001), Magic Seeds (2004)
 ukt parichay isliye jaruri he kyonki aam taur par padhane ke shaukeen tabake kaa ek bada hissaa book stall par lekhak bare main jaanane ke baad hi kitaab kharidta he
 Although Naipaul of Indian origin is not interested in any introduction, it is necessary to write in the introduction and introduction that the writer chose no other profession other than writing
 unki ek kitaab 'e riters pipul' he, jo kaaphi dilachasp he
 As the name itself suggests, this book is about the people to whom the writer has been concerned, or who has inspired them to write
 naypaul ne is kitaab main apni lekhan yatra ko sametane kaa kaam kiya he
 This is a story about a 10-year-old child who wants to become a writer
 isaki shuruyaat vah apni diary se karata he or phir rama rahata he is soch main isamen kya likhe, kya nahin likhe
 This book is the thinking of Naipaul as a writer

 ' chunaavon ke dauraan bhopal se bijepi pratyaashee pragna singh thakur ko kai baar party ne kam bolne kii naseehat di, chunaav ke baad bhi unke tevar naram nahin pade

 kashmir se dhara 370 hataane par pragna ne kaha ki 'iske baad jo deshbhakt hai unki shrenee alag ho chuki he

 dhara 370 or 35 e hatane par jo log khush hai, hamaare desh par garv kar rahe hai, jo log pradhanmantri narendra modi or grih mantri amit shah par garv kar rahe hai vah deshbhakt hai
 He said that this definition has been proved this time, who is with the country and who is against the country
 kashmir se dhara 370 hatane par digvijay singh ke virodh par pragna ne kaha ki 'ham to chunaav isliye lade the ki raashtra dharm ke liye kaam karne vaale logon ko bich main aana chahie
 At the same time, the people have absolutely rejected those who should not be here
 isse pehle shivaraj singh chouhan ne odisha main sadsyta abhiyaan ke dauraan desh ke pratham pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ko kashmir main dhara 370 lagavane par apradhi kaha tha, jiske baad deshbhar main vivaad khadaa ho gaya tha

 is maamle main congress ne palatwaar kiya he
 Media in-charge of Madhya Pradesh Congress Shobha Ojha said that Godse is speaking inside Pragya Thakur
 pragna thakur ji kaa itihaas kisi se chupa nahin he, yah vah nahin unke andar kaa godse se bol rahaa he
 Pragya Thakur, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, these are people of Godseist ideology

 There can be many reasons for a bitterness in a relationship
 kai baar ye bahut gambhir hoti hai to kai baar itani saamaanya ki un par hamaara dhyaan hi nahin jaataa
 According to a recent survey, the use of the wrong words during fighting and fighting also becomes a reason for differences in relationships
 euke main hui ek study main yah baat saamne ai he ki apane rishte main sachai rakhana bahut acchhee baat he lekin jarurat se zyada khulaapan aapke rishte ko kharaab kar saktaa he
 In such a situation it will be better for your relationship to keep these 6 things hidden from the partner
 1
 Never say never to end a relationship
 Sometimes it happens that the promises and the promises made between them are not fulfilled on time
 iskaa matlab ye nahin he ki aapkaa partner aapse pyaar nahin karata or aap us ek vaade ke puraa na hone kii vajah se apana rishta hi khatm karne kii baat karne lagen
 What to do: Try to talk to your partner more and more and also learn to understand their words
 kya na karen:jab bhi ladaai-jhagade kii sthiti bane to bevajaah kii baaten na karen
 2
 partner ko apshbd kehane se bachengussa kisi bhi cheez kaa hal nahin hota
 In such a situation, do not say any such thing, which will have a long-term effect
 kya karen:gusse ke dauraan chup rahanaa hi acha hota he
 Anger increases tension, so whenever this happens, go and sit in a quiet place
 kya na karen:gusse mempartner ko apshabd kehane se bachein
 3
 relationships ko na kosempurane dinon ko yaad kar karke apane patarnar or apane rishte ko bhala-bura kehane se bachein
 By doing this you will only create bitterness in your relationship
 kya karen:aazaadee se jeene kaa haq sabhi ko he isliye ghar kii jimmedaariyon ko aapas main baant len taaki aap bandhaa hua na mahasoos karen
 By doing this, you will be able to make time for yourself too
 kya na karen:jimmedaariyon kaa ronaa lekar na baithen
 4
 gharavaalon se tulana karne se bachenkya tum mujhe apni maa ke jaisaa bananaa chaahate ho yaa phir tum apane papa ke jaise kyon
 
 
 Avoid doing such things
 aapaki ye baaten aapke partner ko dukh pahunchane or aapaki image kharaab karne ke liye kaaphi hai
 What to do: Think about how your family would feel if you spoke about your family like this
 kya na karen:hansi majaak main bhi parivaaravaalon ko nishaanaa na banaaen
 5
 apane kisi krash ke bare main baat na karenapake offis yaa kisi party main aapako koi pasand aayaa hai to uski tulana apane partner se karne se bachein
 Sometimes a situation arises due to stress or due to fluctuations in the relationship
 kya karen:aise kisi bhi krash yaa like ko bas sapanom tak hi rakhen
 In reality there is nothing better than your partner
 kya na karen:kabhi bhi aisi sthiti main khud ko kamjor na hone den
 6
 baton ko dil se lagaana chhod denyaad karen jab aap rishte kii shuruyaat main the or baton ko ignor kar diya karte the
 If there is a debate between you about something, then try to end the matter there itself
 kya karen:baat ko khinchne kii jagahpartner kii galati par khud sori bol denese baat bhi khatm ho jaaegi or rishte main nai taazgi bani rahegi
 What not to do: If the matter is being discussed on a serious matter, then avoid doing it
 lokanayak jaiprakash narayan us sitab diyaara main bhi nahin hai jahaan paidaa hue or us raajnneeti ke centre main bhi nahin hai jise badalane kaa ek zordaar prayaas kiya he
 JP suddenly resurrects and disappears in our politics like an old brand and disappears
 ramlila maidan kii sabhaayen unka naam lekar kisi kranti kaa aagaaz karne lagati hai or lutian dilli kii dhalaanon par pahunch kar satta kii baat karne lagati hai
 What makes JP so easy to remember
 kai dashak biit jane ke baad jepi ko ab ek murti ke rup main hi yaad kiya ja saktaa he
 Where is the time to see his complete revolution in its entirety
 kai peediyaan badal gayi to isse acha he ki maalyarpan kar yaad karne kii rasm adaa kar di jaae
 But it is pleasant for democracy that jp's name keeps returning on one pretext
 asafal hi sahi magar azaadi ke baad ke bharat main loktantr ko lekar jo sawaal uthe wo un sawaalon kaa pehla padaav he
 Remembering JP means recalling the questions of democracy
 naakaamiyon ko yaad karne se sakaaraatmakataa aati he
 The only people who like the chasm of positivity are those sly people who want to eliminate the truths of life in its name
 bi positive
 The biggest slogan of democracy is slogan
 ummid kaa matlab hota he un sawaalon se takaraana jinke hal hamen khojane hai
 Expectation does not mean shouting slogans before finding a solution
 patna ke gandhi maidan main us rose bahut barish ho rahi thi
 a nanny mother from Munger was holding my hand
 raste main chappal chhot gaya
 Neighbors' friends also have their own grandmother
 main poochta rahaa ki kise dekhne ja rahi hai
 Who are chup kar
 You will not understand chalo
 The elder leader is dead
 darshan karnaa chahie
 Only the leader leads
 patna ke krishna memorial haal main jepi kaa parthiv sharir rakhaa tha
 If i remember correctly, i saw JP too, holding the hand of that old grandmother in a crowd of millions
 uske baad jab hosh sambhala to jepi ko har bahes main zindaa paaya
 He was like a soul who used to take the form of a ghost in every debate
 bahesbaaz jaldi se unka naam lekar bhaag jate the
 Today, to recall the same JP, the articles of the late journalist Prabhash Joshi started turning around
 raajakmal prakaashan ne unke lekhon kaa sangrah chapa he
 There is an article when Cannon Mukabih Ho is in the collection and the other is the geography of Lutyens' mound
 main bas us lekh ke bahaane jepi ke uthaae sawaalon ko yahaan rakhana chahta hum taaki jepi kaa bhoot phir zindaa ho jaae or uske baad jise jahaan bhaagna ho bhaag jaae
 The title of the article is JP and Indira Gandhi
 prabhaash joshi likhte hai ki "upi or odisha ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke chaar karod rupee ikatthe kiye gaye
 This worried JP so much that he went to meet Indira ji and said that if Congress collects so much money and millions of rupees will be spent in each election, then what will democracy mean
 sirf vahi chunaav lard sakegaa jiske paas dhanabal or baahubal rahegaa
 There will be no scope for a modest man
 jepi ne bataaya ki puri baatcheet main indira apane nakhunon ko katarti raheen
 Jaypee was deeply saddened by Indira's attitude
 " Would today, who would take the name of JP would like to confront this question
 naam lene vaale kis netaa ne mahangi hoti chunavi raajnneeti ke khilaaf bolne kii bhi aupchaarikta nibhaai he
 JP is just like a male bead
 jaldi jaldi gino or jaldi jaldi japo
 Now the leaders also give details of their property and the public reads it and puts it aside
 yah sawaal poochne kii himmt to janata main bhi nahin bachi he
 Nobody tells what they do, what is the source of income and nobody even asks how the wealth of crores of rupees increased from the last assembly to this assembly
 ye jepi ke sawaal hai
 Have we made democracy worthy of common man's participation
 parivarwar hi ek maatr rog nahin he
 From local to national level, a network of people involved in politics has been formed which is thriving with the help of contracts to dealerships
 is network ke rahete kisi saadhaaran vyakti ke liye loktantr main bhagidaari karnaa aasaan nahin he
 Political parties are now renting this network
 ye network ab kisi bhi dal kaa banaaya ho saktaa he or ise koi bhi dal apane main milakar satta praapt kar saktaa he
 Then the leaders who came to power with the name of JP did nothing that could teach the people and the leaders who became Indira
 aaj aaraam se kisi netaa main indira kii chhavi khoj lee jaati he
 Leaders do not have any problem with this
 ham tay hi nahin kar paae ki indira immergency kii khalanayika hai yaa adarsh netaa banane kaa plaster of paris kaa koi sancha jisamen dhalakar koi bhi indira jaisaa netaa ban jaataa he
 Finally, Prabhash Joshi writes that in this way the Janata government's attempt to capture Indira Gandhi, send him to jail and punish him ended in gimmick
 jepi ne kaha tha ki badale kii karrwai mat karnaa
 Morarji and Charan Singh did the same to prepare the way for Indira Gandhi's return
 jepi ke sawaal to ab bhi gum rahe hai
 Prabhash Joshi recalls the Emergency in an article named Cannon Muqabil Ho
 “akhbaar lekhon, vishleshanon se nahin bazaar ko saadhane ke upkarnon se bhare rahen isliye sampadak, patrkaar or pathak bhi gaiyr-zaruri ho gaye hai
 The motivation and profits of the marketing newspaper became the goal
 ramnath goyanka ne immergency kii ladaai main apana puraa akhbaar gharaana jhonk diya tha ab kisi rashtriya sarokaar par koi akhbaar stand tak nahin letaa
 The newspapers want to keep the market and politicians busy by making smooth talk
 immergency ke baad ve sab partiyaan or ve sab netaa sattarudh ho chuke hai jo jepi andolan main the- morarji desai se lekar atal bihari vaajapeyi tak
 First the Janata Party was headed, then the Janata Dal, then the Third Front and now the Bharatiya Janata Party
 ye sab jepi andolan kii seedhi chadhakar ai hai or ab seedhi ko uthaakar janata ke paas pahunchane kaa rasta chhod chuki hai
 Some parties made casteism a means of reaching the throne in the name of the Mandal Commission
 sangh parivaar ne babari masajid todakar sampradayikta kaa rasta liya
 The JP movement was a movement to bring public service dedication in place of the Congress's upcountry of power
 uske kandhe par chadhakar jo bhi netaa or party satta kii bandarbant ke bantwaare main aae unne sabit kiya ki raaj chalaane kaa ek hi tarika he or vah he congressi tarika'' "poor JP used to say that this movement is not for any of these politicians to replace Indira Gandhi and establish the rule of non-congress parties
 yah us janata ko singhaasana par bithaane ke liye he jo jhonpadi se uthakar rajdhani kii taraf kooch kar rahi he
 The leaders of the JP movement and the entire revolution sent the people back to the huts and occupied the thrones themselves
 '' Prabhash Joshi is saying this even today that every political movement should be strictly evaluated
 acha he ki ham apane netaaon ko yaad rakhte hai or kisi na kisi bahaane unka naam chalaate rahete hai, magar or bhi acha hoga jab ham unke sawaalon ko bhi saamne rakhen
 That is why there is no Loknayak after Loknayak
 jo bhi hota he yaa hona chahta he khud ko mahanayake bananaa chahta he
 After the Balakot air strike, all temporary restrictions on air routes in India's airspace have been lifted
 bhartiya vaayu sena kii ore se shuukravaar shaam yah jaankaree di gai

 Accusing Captain and Badal of contesting elections in Punjab together, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday that the movement of the bored state from both parties now wants change and hence people are looking towards Aam Aadmi Party
 jalandhar jile ke mehatpur ilaake main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hueam aadmi partike rashtriya sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne kaha, punjab kii awam captain amarinder singh or prakaash singh badal se ub chuki he, isliye is baar vidhansabha chunaavon main vah badlaav chaahati he
 This is the reason that the trust and confidence of the people here is increasing towards the Aam Aadmi Party
 kejariwal ne kaha, logon ko pataa he ki captain or badal parivaar ne baari-baari se punjab ko luutane kaa hi kaam kiya he, isliye rajya main ab badlaav kii hawa he or yah aap ke samarthan main he, kyonki ham jahaan bhi jate hai hajaaron kii sankhya main log hamen sunne aate hai
 We are very young people, yet people are coming
 aap sanyojak ne kaha, punjab main amarinder singh or badal main andrunisanthganthhai
 The two leaders are in collusion as both have reached an agreement that Captain will rob the state for five years and Badal for five years and both have looted the state together for the last 15 years
 kejariwal ne aarope lagaaya ki saal 2002 tak captain amarinder ke paas ghar kii putai karaane tak ke paise nahin the, phir vah mukhyamantri bane or july 2005 main unki patni paranit cor tathaa bete raninder ke naam swiss bank main khaataa khulaa or punjab ko lut kar usamen jamkar rupaya jamaa kiya gaya
 While telling the number of the Swiss bank account of the captain's wife and son, Kejriwal claimed that till 2007, the money has been deposited in those accounts every month and if he is misinformed, the captain should file a case against him
 unhone kaha, 'captain or badal main mileebhagat nahin hoti to captain ke khilaaf saare maamle band nahin kar die jate
 The Chief Minister would ask the Central Government to take action against the Captain, but this cannot happen because before the Modi Government, the Congress Government of the Center had not taken any action against Bikram Majithia, instead there will be no action against the Captain

 After the meeting of the newly-elected mlas in the state, Union Finance Minister and bjp's Central Supervisor Arun Jaitley said in a press conference that the legislators have authorized party president Amit Shah to decide on the future strategy for forming the government
 unhone kaha, sarkaar jo bhi banaae, bijepi kii mahatvapurn bhoomika hogi, kyonki chunaavon main party ko mili voton kaa pratishat sarvaadhik rahaa
 Jaitley said, we will proceed with three principles based on national and state interests

 When nothing is happening somewhere, something happens on the border of India and China
 agar iskaa sambandh manovaigyanik dabaav banane se he to aise vishyon se dur rahane ke baad bhi mujhe lagata he ki ab china us tarah kaa manouvaigyanik dabaav nahin bana paata he
 Had it been made, like the Amarnath Yatra, there would have been an uproar when the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra was stopped
 isse zyaada hangaamaa pakistan ke saath kuch hone par ho jaataa he
 Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi has said that there have been 120 incarcerations from China in the last 45 days
 is saal aise 240 inkarzan ho chuke hai
 This has never happened before
 agar singhvi kii baat sahi he to kya china asaadhaaran rup se apni aakraamakata ko teevr kar rahaa he
 The exporter of cheap goods to India does not want to charge a heavy price on the border
 'times of india' kii khabar ke anusaar bharat ne doklam main 1962 ke baad pehali baar baari maatra main sainikon kii tainaati kii he
 India does not want to take any risk, but why would China with a turnover of 5 billion dollars from India want to risk such a huge market? sikkim, bhutan or tibet ke trikon par he dokalam, vahaan par china kii tukdi sadak banane ke liye pravesh karti he
 The Royal Bhutan Army, which is patrolling there, stops and the Indian Army also joins it
 khabar ai ki china ne bharat ke asthaayee bunker dhwast kar diye
 The media report said that there was a rift between the soldiers of China and India
 hathiyaaron kaa istamaal nahin hua
 India does not want China to complete the road there, so that it will reach very close to the Siliguri Corridor
 udhar china kaa daawa he ki vah apni seemaa main sadak bana rahaa he
 India is accusing it of encroaching on its border
 vahaan kii sena piele ke pravaktaa ne bharat ko 1962 yuddh kii haar kii yaad dilaate hue kaha ki bharat kii sena yuddh ke liye zyaada baichaiyn na ho
 Why was there a need for rhetoric to this extent? bharat ke thal senadhyaksh general bipin ravat ne kaha tha ki bharat apni aantarik ugravad se jujhate hue bhi do tarafa yuddh jhel saktaa he
 India does not feel under the psychological pressure of China from anywhere
 balki shuukravaar ko videsh mantralay ne ek bayaan diya ki bharat china ke tazaa kadamon ko lekar chintit he or china kii sarkaar ko apni chintaa se avgat kara chukaa he ki is tarah ke nirmaan se yathasthiti main kaaphi badlaav aa jaataa he
 India and China have been hitting near the Line of Actual Control on the Jammu and Kashmir border
 2013 or 2014 main china ne bharat kii seemaa main ghuspaith kii thi
 Doklam's controversy has become so popular for the first time
 bharat ke raksha mantri arun jetali ne india today channel ke kaarykram main bayaan de diya ki bharat bhi 1962 vaala bharat nahin he, 2017 kaa bharat he
 a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry also did not lend a reply
 kaha ki china bhi 1962 vaala china nahin he
 Defense Minister Jaitley says that the confrontation in the area was initiated by Beijing with the road construction initiative, which India is concerned about
 dokalam kaa maujuuda vivaadit kshetra maatr 90 varg kimi kaa pahari ilaaka he
 China is building a road via Doklam to reach Bhutan's border
 china kaa kahana he ki sikkim par 1890 kii china or britain kii sandhi kaa bharat ke purv pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ne bhi samarthan kiya tha
 He supported this in a letter sent to the then Prime Minister of China, Chou En Lai
 china kaa kahana he ki bharat is sandhi kaa sammaan kare or doklam se apni sena ko waapas bulaae
 Bhutan has told China that it is encroaching its border, on which China says that India is using Bhutan as a shield
 bharat or bhutan ke bich samjhauta he ki bharat bhutan kii simaaon kii suraksha karegaa
 Claiming on a geographical area by showing a letter is also strangely ridiculous
 antarrashtriya simaaon par chitthee or bayanon se daawa kiya jane lage to ho chukaa
 Obviously, experts are trying to understand why China is so aggressive
 kya bharat ke van belt van road project main shaamil na hone se naaraaz he, kya bharat or america kii nazadiiki se naaraaz he, kya dalai lamas ke arunachal pradesh jane se naaraaz he, koi ek spasht kaaran nazar nahin aata he
 When the President of China came to India in 2014, he was given a grand welcome
 sabarmati ke tat par jhula bhi jhulaayaa gaya tha tab bhi china ne ladakh kshetra main ghuspaith kar di thi
 Even then, can we see that intrusion in terms of these reasons
 tab to bharat ne van belt van road kaa virodh bhi nahin kiya tha
 Let us tell you, One Belt, One Road is the most ambitious project of China so far, whose budget is one trillion US dollars i
e
 seven hundred trillion rupees which is about one third of the total economy of India
 van belt van road china ke raashtrapati shi chinafing kaa sapana he
 The aim of which has been stated to improve China's contact and cooperation with Asian countries and also to connect Africa and Europe closely with Asian countries
 beijing main iske udghaatan ke maukey par china samet 29 deshon ke rashtrapramukh or 70 anya deshon ke pratinidhi maujuud rahe
 Under this project, trade routes will be improved through land and sea routes
 kai hai speed rail network honge jo europe tak jaaenge
 This route will pass through several ports in Asia and Africa and many free trade zones will come through it
 china duniya ke pansth deshon ko ek duusare ke qareeb laaegaa or duniya kii do-tihaai aabaadi ko apni arthvyavastha se sidhe jod degaa
 The comments bharat ne tab bhi apni bhugolic samprabhutaa ko praathamikta di or itane mahatvapurn project se khud ko alag kar liya
 Why was China upset in May when Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi went to inaugurate the bridge connecting Assam and Arunachal Pradesh
 tab to ve trump ke america bhi nahin gaye the
 At that time, Trump had praised the President of China
 brahmaputra nadi par bane is pul ke kaaran assam or arunachal pradesh kaaphi kareeb aa gaye
 This bridge is very close to the india-china border
 tab china ne bayaan jari kar kaha tha ki bharat ke saath uskaa seemaa vivaad chal rahaa he isliye purvottar bharat main buniyadi dhaanchon kaa nirmaan karne main sanyam barte
 China had expressed such a reaction during the Dalai Lama's visit to Arunachal Pradesh
 magar yah kaaran he to upie ke daur main bhi dalai lamas arunachal pradesh gaye the or phir tibet ko lekar bharat ne apni niti main koi khaas parivartan kiya he yaa puraani niti main aakramta kaa put daalaa he, yah bhi saaf nahin he
 Obviously, China will not tease us with the reasons, the reasons will be different
 china ko ham taatkaalik kaarnon kii nazar se dekhne ke aadi rahe hai, behatar he taatkaalik kaarnon ke saath-saath uski doorgaami nitiyon kii bhi samiksha kerani chahie
 Strategic alliances may be changing at the world level
 bharat ke pradhanmantri khulkar asia kii sadi kii baat karte hai, china asia ke netritv karne kii dabi ichha rakhata he
 If it sometimes surrounds India with Pakistan through Gwadar project, India meets Iran 72 km away from there and gets out of China through the Chabahar project
 par kya china bhartiya seemaa par saamaanya se zyaada sakriy ho rahaa he? Doklam lies on the triangle of Sikkim, Bhutan and Tibet, where the Chinese contingent enters to make a road
 vahaan petroling kar rahi royal bhutan army rokatii he or bharat kii sena bhi usamen shaamil ho jaati he
 The news came that China demolished India's temporary bunkers
 media report main kaha gaya he ki china or bharat ke sainikon ke bich gutmagutthi ho gai
 Weapons were not used
 bharat nahin chahta ki china vahaan sadak puri kare, isse vah silligudi koridor ke kaaphi kareeb pahunch jayega
 On the other hand, China claims that it is building a road in its border
 bharat uski seemaa main atikaraman karne kaa aarope laga rahaa he
 The army PLA spokesperson reminded India of the defeat of the 1962 war and said that India's army should not be too restless for the war
 is had tak bayaanbazi kii zarurat kyon padi
 General Bipin Rawat, the Chief of the Army Staff of India, had said that India can withstand a two-sided war despite battling its internal extremism
 bharat kahin se bhi china ke manovaigyanik dabaav main nahin lagata he
 Rather, on Friday, the Foreign Ministry gave a statement that India is concerned about China's recent steps and has conveyed its concern to the Chinese government that such a construction changes the status quo
 jammu kashmir seemaa par bharat or china line aaf ektual control ke paas takaraate rahe hai
 In 2013 and 2014, China infiltrated India's border
 doklam kaa vivaad pehali baar itnaa charchit hua he
 India's Defense Minister Arun Jaitley gave a statement in India Today Channel's program that India is also not a 1962 India, it is 2017 India
 china ke videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa ne bhi jawaab udhaar nahin rakhaa
 Said that China is also not 1962 China
 raksha mantri jetali kaa kahana he ki ilaake main takaraav kii shuruyaat beijing ne sadak nirmaan kii pahal se kii thi, jise lekar bharat chintit he
 The current disputed area of doklam is a mere 90 sq km hilly area
 bhutan kii seemaa tak pahunchane ke liye china dokalam ke raste sadak bana rahaa he
 China says that the Treaty of China and Britain of 1890 on Sikkim was also supported by former Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru
 china ke tab ke pradhanmantri chaauu en laai ko bheje khat main unhone ye samarthan kiya tha
 China says India should honor the treaty and withdraw its army from Doklam
 bhutan ne china se kaha he ki vah uski seemaa kaa atikaraman kar rahaa he, is par china kaa kahana he ki bharat, bhutan kaa dhaal kii tarah istamaal kar rahaa he
 There is agreement between India and Bhutan that India will protect the borders of Bhutan
 chitthee dikhaakar kisi bhugolic kshetra par daavedaari bhi ajeeb haasyaaspad he
 It has already been claimed by letters and statements on international borders
 zaahir he jaankaar samajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai ki china itnaa aakraamak kyon hai
 Is India angry at not joining the One Belt One Road project, is it annoyed with the close proximity of India and the US, is the anger of the Dalai Lama going to Arunachal Pradesh, there is no clear reason
 2014 main jab china ke raashtrapati bharat aae the tab unka bhavy swaagat kiya gaya tha
 On the banks of the Sabarmati, a swing was also made, even then China had infiltrated the Ladakh region
 tab bhi kya us ghuspaith ko ham in kaarnon ke sandarbh main dekh sakate hai
 At that time, India did not even oppose the One Belt One Road
 aapako bataa den van belt, van road china kaa ab tak kaa sabase mahatvakankshi project he, jiskaa bajet he das kharab america dollar yani saat sau kharab rupye jo bharat kii kul arthvyavastha kaa qareeb ek tihaai he
 One Belt One Road is the dream of Chinese President Xi Jinping
 jiskaa makasad bataaya gaya he asian deshon ke saath china kaa sampark or sahyog behatar karnaa or africa or europe ko bhi asian deshon ke saath qareebi se jodna
 Representatives of 29 countries including China and representatives of 70 other countries were present at its inauguration in Beijing
 is project ke tahat zamin or samudri raaston se vyapaar margon ko behatar banaaya jayega
 There will be several high speed rail networks that will go as far as Europe
 asia or africa main kai bandargahon se ye root guzaregaa or iske raste main kai free trade zone aaenge
 China will bring sixty-five countries around the world and connect two-thirds of the world's population directly to its economy
 tippaniyan India still preferred its geographical sovereignty and distanced itself from such an important project
 may main china kyon pareshaan hua tha jab bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi assam or arunachal pradesh ko jodne vaale pul kaa udghaatan karne gaye
 At that time, he did not even visit Trump's America
 tab to trump ne china ke raashtrapati kii hi jamkar tarif kii thi
 Assam and Arunachal Pradesh came very close due to this bridge over the Brahmaputra River
 yah pul bharat china seemaa ke kaaphi kareeb he
 At that time, China had issued a statement saying that its border dispute with India was going on, so there was restraint in building infrastructure in Northeast India
 arunachal pradesh main dalai lamas kii yatra ke samay china ne aisi pratikriya vyakt kii thi
 But this is the reason, the Dalai Lama went to Arunachal Pradesh even during the UPA era and then India has made some special changes in its policy regarding Tibet or has added aggression in the old policy, it is also not clear
 zaahir he china hamaare saamne maujuud kaarnon se nahin chidhaa hoga, kaaran kuch or honge
 We are accustomed to looking at the immediate cause of China, it is better to review its long-term policies along with the immediate reasons
 ho saktaa he duniya ke str par samrik gathbandhan badal rahe hon
 The Prime Minister of India openly talks about the century of Asia, China has a strong desire to lead Asia
 wo kabhi pakistan ke saath guadar project ke zariye bharat ko gherta he to bharat vahaan se 72 kimi dur iran se milakar chabahaar project ke zariye china ke daanv se nikal jaataa he
 But is China becoming more active than usual on the Indian border? jammu kashmir seemaa par bharat or china line aaf ektual control ke paas takaraate rahe hai
