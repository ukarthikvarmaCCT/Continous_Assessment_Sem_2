 aavashyak vastuon ko jiesti se baahar rakhaa gaya he to kai chizein aisi hai jo pehali baar tex ke daayre main aaengi
 Integrated GST is not a new tax but a new system
 iske zariye do rajyon ke bich vyapaar par nazar rakhi jaaegi
 It is being said that this will complicate the process
 kaise jatil hogi, jab main ise padhane laga to chakkar aa gaya
 Then left and understand what you see in the advertisements
 vaise suresh ji ne kaaphi saral tareeke se samajha diya he lekin tivi par samayabhaav or jagahabhav ke kaaran ham use chhod rahe hai
 If history is being made, you should also do some hard work
 ab aate hai ritern par
 Three returns have to be filed every month which will be different from each other
 GSTR-1, masik bikri kaa vivaran hoga jo agle maheene kii das taarikh tak jamaa karnaa hoga
 GSTR-2 will be the details of the monthly purchase which has to be submitted by the 15th of the next month
 10 taarikh se pehle jamaa nahin kar sakate kyonki aapako das tak bikri kaa vivaran jamaa karnaa hoga, isliye aap kharid kaa vivaran 10 ke baad hi 15 taarikh tak jamaa karne honge
 GSTR-3 This is the monthly tax return which has to be submitted by the 20th of the following month
 GSTR-9 ye vaarshik ritern he jo vitt varsh kii samaapti ke baad 31 disambar tak jamaa karne honge
 Thus, 37 returns have to be filled in the entire year
 yah ritern sarkaar ne jo jiestn network banaaya he vahaan jaakar bharne honge
 In the past, you were paying VAT and filling online only
 sudhir halaakhandee ne likhaa he ki isse jude praavdhaanon ke paalan ke liye kaaphi mehnat kerani hogi, balki samay kii mushkil seemaa kaa bhi paalan karnaa hoga kyonki jabatak pehla vikreta ritern nahin bharegaa, tab tak usase kareedne vaala apana ritern nahin bhar sakegaa
 As soon as this happens, the entire chain will break and the system will know
 is antar ko thik karne ke liye sirf do maheene kaa samay diya gaya he
 If the first dealer did not fill the returns, closed the shop and disappeared, then the same amount of GST you have given to him, you will replenish the same amount
 agar pehle vaale kaa vichaar badal gaya or usne bhar diya to aapako wo rakam waapas mil jaaegi
 Now you will say how do we know that the dealer you are buying the goods from is trustworthy
 to iske liye jiesti kii site par dealron kii reating di jaaegi
 Every trader will be able to see the rating of another trader which will be on the GSTN site
 ab aate hai bill par
 On 1 July you go to your shop
 graahak ko maal bechate hai to pehla jiesti bill kaise kaatenge
 Apart from computer, you can get your bill book printed under GST
 maan lijie ki aap kapadaa vyapaaree hai
 On Saturday, when a customer arrives at your shop and buys 100 shirts, how to make the bill
 kul 15 prakaar kii jaankaree honi chahie aapke paas
 Seller and buyer must have name, address and GSTN number
 bill jari karne kii taarikh, uskaa serial number bhi hona chahie
 You have to enter the description, quantity and total price of the goods
 dealer ke dastakhat anivaary hai
 There will be three copies of each bill
 ek aap rakhenge, doosraa kharidaar ke paas or teesraa transporter ke liye
 You should get it printed
 tippaniyan Every merchant has to bear the cost of printing
 jiesti ke tahat sazaa kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 Are there provisions for arrest under GST
 kya isse choti moti naadaani aapako jail main pahunchaa degi, ye ashanka he yaa vaaki aisa he

 aavashyak vastuon ko jiesti se baahar rakhaa gaya he to kai chizein aisi hai jo pehali baar tex ke daayre main aaengi
 Now come to the return
 har maheene teen ritern bharne honge jo ek-duusare se alag honge
 GSTR-1 will be the details of the monthly sales which have to be submitted by the 10th of the next month
 GSTR-2 masik kharid kaa vivaran hoga jo agle maah kii 15 taarikh tak jamaa karnaa hoga
 Can't submit before 10 date because you have to submit the details of the sale till ten, so you will have to submit the details of the purchase only after the 15th
 GSTR-3 ye masik kar kaa ritern he jo agle maah kii 20 taarikh tak jamaa karne honge
 GSTR-9 is the annual return which has to be submitted by 31 December after the end of the financial year
 is prakaar puure saal main 37 ritern bharne honge
 The GSTN network created by the government will have to be returned
 aap pehle bhi waite vagairah online hi bhar rahe the
 Sudhir Hhalakhandi has written that it will have to work very hard to follow the provisions related to it, but also to adhere to the difficult time limit because till the first seller returns, the buyer will not be able to fill his returns
 aisa hote hi puri chen main brake aa jayega or system ko pataa chal jayega
 Only two months have been given to correct this gap
 agar pehle dealer ne ritern nahin bharaa, dukaan band kar gaayab ho gaya to jo jiesti aapane use di he, utani hi rakam aap dobaaraa bharenge
 If the idea of the former changed and filled it, you will get that amount back
 ab aap kahenge ki hamen kaise maaloom ki jisase maal kharid rahe hai wo dealer bharosemand he
 So for this, the rating of dealers will be given on the site of GST
 har vyapaaree duusare vyapaaree kii reating dekh sakegaa jo jiestn kii site par hogi
 Now come to the bill
 1 july ko aap apni dukaan par jate hai
 If you sell goods to the customer then how to deduct the first GST bill
 jiesti ke tahat aap computer ke alaava apni bill book bhi chhapava sakate hai
 Suppose you are a cloth merchant
 shanivaar ko aapaki dukaan par koi graahak pahunchataa he or 100 shart kharidta he to bill kaise banaayenge
 You should have a total of 15 types of information
 vikreta or karidaar kaa naam, pataa or jiestn number zarur hona chahie
 The date of issue of the bill should also be its serial number
 maal kaa vivaran, maatra or kul keemat aapako darj karnaa hoga
 Dealer signatures are mandatory
 har bill kii teen prati hogi
 One you will keep, the other with the buyer and the third for the transporter
 ise aapako chhapava kar rakh lenaa chahie
 The comments chhapavane kii laagat har vyapaaree ko khud uthaani padegi
 There is also a provision of punishment under GST
 kya jiesti ke tahat giraftaar ke praavdhaan hai
 Is it a little silly that will lead you to jail, is it a doubt or is it really so
 ye bhi jaanane kaa prayaas karte hai
 Suresh ji has written in Hindi that under Section 69 of GST, provisions for arrest have been given
 agar kisi ne 132 ke tahat aparaadh kiya he to giraftaar ho saktaa he
 The CGST officer will make the arrest and the order will be that of the commissioner
 kuch aparaadh gair jamaanti hai or kuch jamaanti
 Arrests will not be held without the order of the Commissioner
 bina bill kaa maal supplai karenge, kar chori ke iraade se
 One can go to jail for issuing a bill without GST
 jiesti lekar teen maheene tak jamaa nahin karne par jail jaaenge
 If there is theft of more than 2 crores then the provisions of arrest apply
 yani 2 karod se kam kii kar chori par jail jane se batch sakate hai
 The medium and small range dealer need not fear
 magar aap do baar jiesti kaa ulanghan karte hai to jail ja sakate hai
 Then it will not be seen whether there is a charge of tax evasion of 2 crores
 0 pratishat, 5 pratishat, 12 pratishat, 18 pratishat or 28 pratishat tex hai jiesti ke tahat
 If essential commodities are kept out of GST, then there are many things that will come under the tax ambit for the first time

 Kashmiri apple orchards in Varanasi's village Jayapur, adopted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will soon be in the air
 isaki shuruyaat buudhvaar ko 75 paudhon se kar di gai
 75 not apple plants were distributed to 15 farmers in Jayapur village, not a single Muslim in Modi's lap

 seb ke paudhon ke aane se graminon main utsaah he
 Now the wait is for the smooth cultivation of these plants which can give a picture to the Prime Minister's dream

 com / w3cr5avayf — Hrithik Roshan (@ihrithik) September 20, 2014 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bijepi ke saath bhavishya main unki party jediu ke kisi prakaar ke gathbandhan se inkaar karte hue kaha ki chaahe jo bhi parinaam ho, yah adhyay hameshaa ke liye band ho gaya he
 After discussing Governor DY Patil's address during the joint session of Bihar Legislature last January 14, in order to answer on behalf of the government on Tuesday, Nitish said that under no circumstances is there any question of any future alliance with BJP Arises chaahe iske jo bhi parinaam hon
 On the bjp's allegation of betrayal of public opinion, Nitish retorted that he did not break the trust, rather the BJP betrayed him by forgetting the promise made about the alliance
 nitish ne daawa kiya ki endie ke shasankaal main upmukhyamantri rahe susheel kumaar modi ne bijepi ke tatkaaleen rashtriya adhyaksh nitin gadakari ke saath bijepi ke ek anya varisht netaa ke dilli main sthit awaas par pichley saal unki mulaakaat karwaai thi or gadakari ne aashwast kiya tha
 He said that even senior BJP leader LK Advani had assured him that the party president's promise regarding Modi would be upheld but due to this he was forced to part with the NDA
 mukhyamantri ke is khulaase ke baad pratipaksh ke netaa nandakishor yadav ne apane seat se khadey hokar iskaa kade shabdon main virodh karte hue kaha ki ve unke in netaaon kaa naam le rahe hai, jabaki ve apana paksh rakhane ke liye sadan main maujuud nahin hai
 Overcoming Nandkishore's objection, Nitish said that he had given his views in an interview in an English newspaper about a year and a half ago about what the Prime Minister of the country should be like
 uske das maheene ke baad bijepi main diwaar par likhi ibaarat ko padhate hue apane siddhant ke kaaran usase rishta todane kaa nirnay le liya
 He said about the uproar when bjp's national and state unit leaders broke ties with JDU that they felt the end of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's era in BJP and the beginning of a new era
 Took nitish ne nandakishor se kaha ki agar ve sadan ke is satr ke dauraan yaa kisi anya din chahen, uske liye ve sadan ke adhyaksh se anurodh kar vishesh satr bula denge
 He said that he does not care about bringing down his government by bringing a no-confidence motion
 dilli hoicourt ne tandoor cond ke doshi susheel sharma(sushil Sharma) ko turant reeha karne kaa aadesh diya he
 In the last hearing, the Delhi High Court had asked the Delhi government why Sushil has not been released even after 29 years of imprisonment
 darasal youth congress ke purv netaa susheel ne 1995 main apni patni naina saahani kii hatya karne ke badashav ko tandoor main jala diya tha
 Sushil Sharma, who has been 56 years old, claimed in his petition that if he adds the period of pardon, he is in jail for 29 years
 agar maafee kii avadhi nikaal den to saadhe 23 saal se vah jail main he
 On this basis, he demanded release
 susheel kii centens rivyuu board ne arji dilli sarkaar ne khaarij kar di thi, jiske baad usne dilli hoicourt main arji daakhil kar di thi
 Let us tell you that in the past the Delhi High Court has lashed out at the police for not complying with its orders to release former Youth Congress leader Sushil Sharma on parole

 shivasena ne rakanpa adhyaksh sharad pavaar ko naseehat di he
 The Shiv Sena says that Sharad Pawar should get into the habit of doing homework before making a statement on the Prime Minister's chair
 sharad pavaar ne kuch dinon pehle sangh ke khilaaf tippanee karte hue kaha tha ki maalegaanv bam dhamaakon ke aropiyon kii giraftaar ke baad se desh main koi dhamaake nahin hue
 This reaction of Shiv Sena has come on this statement of Pawar
 shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne thane main kaha ki mumbai main aatanki hamale maalegaanv bam dhamaakon ke aropiyon kii giraftaar ke baad hue
 Pawar should have kept this statement in mind before claiming the Prime Minister's post
 kendriya grih mantri ne bayaan "yah padosi he ki maanata nahin " se vah sab kuch daalaa jo pakistan ko lekar maujuuda sarkaar kii policy he
 Or say a complicated policy, in which there is sometimes a soft or sometimes warm environment
 kai afasar jo bharat-pakistan ke hameshaa badalte rishton se acchhee tarah se waakif hai, kehete hai ki jab se yah sarkaar ai he tab se pakistan ko lekar videsh niti kii disha pataa nahin lag paa rahi he
 a senior official told NDTV India that "this statement of the Home Minister reveals a lot
 yah tippanee khaskar pradhanmantri ke liye he, jo pakistan achaanak chale gaye or uske baad sabko yakeen dilaate rahe ki pakistan bharat kii madad kar rahaa he
 " unke mutabik pakistan main grih mantri ke saath jo bartaav hua vah bahut kharaab tha
 But still he took steps with restraint
 north blaak kii raay he ki "pakistan ne kabhi bharat ke kisi mantri ke saath itnaa bura bartaav nahin kiya, lekin chunki hamaari videsh niti hi tay nahin he isiilie use bhi shah mili hui he
 " darasal centre sarkaar ko samaj nahin aa rahaa ki vah pakistan ko kis tarah ingez kare
 For the last few months, the central government was constantly trying to justify Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Pakistan, even after the Pathankot attack
 ek adhikari kaa kahana he ki "pakistan kii team ko bharat main air base tak ghumaya gaya lekin pakistan ne enie ke jane ko abhi tak manjuuri nahin di
 " yahi nahin kashmir main jo kuch hua vah sab ko maaloom he
 Pakistan celebrated Black Day for those killed in Kashmir
 raisina hills main baithe ek adhikari kaa kahana he ki "pichley kuch maheene main pakistan ne bharat kii ore kadaa rukh ikhtiyaar kar liya he lekin phir bhi ham kuch nahin kah paae
 "according to him a few days ago Pakistan's Defense Minister Khwaja Asif even said that people are being killed in Kashmir because of Narendra Modi
 khwaja asif ne bayaan diya tha ki "jo gujarat main kiya, ab kashmir main kar rahaa he
 " aise maahaul main grih mantri pakistan gaye or vahaan na sirf khari-khari sunaakar aae balki yah bhi sabko jataa diya ki bharat pakistan ke bare main kya sochataa he
 The comments udhar grih mantri baar-baar zikr kar rahe hai ki ve pakistan main khaanaa khaakar nahin aae
 Critics are also seeing a screw behind this
 ek afasar kaa akalan he ki "modi achaanak nawaz sharif ke kehane par pakistan chale gaye the
 But the Home Minister went to the SAARC conference, lodged his displeasure there and also heard a lot
 " aise main rajnath kaa kad kaaphi ooncha hua he
 He has emerged as a strong nationalist leader
 grih mantri ke khud ke shabdon main bharat ne "pakistan ko munh tod jawaab diya
 " vaise jaankaar bataate hai ki isse pehle 1990 ke dashak main donon deshon ke bich tab talkhi itani bad gai thi jab donon deshon ke bich videsh sachiv str kii meeting thi
 An old bureaucrat who was part of that meeting told that "the Secretary of Pakistan was Tanveer Ahmed then and Muchkund Dubey of India
 pakistan jab bharat kii bigadati halaat par baat nahin sun rahaa tha tab dube ne file uthaakar ahamed khan kii or phenk di thi
 He also tabled a dossier India and threw

 "according to him, Narasimha Rao's government came in 1991 and stopped Engaging Pakistan altogether
 unhone bataaya ki "tab bhi paanch-chah saal donon deshon ke bich baatcheet nahin hui thi
 That is why it is not new

 The UCPN (maoist) condemned the Indian government's 'operation Green Hunt' campaign against Indian Naxalites in a meeting that ended on Saturday

 Due to this, no decision was taken on this issue in the session
 prachand ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki unhone sabha main is mudde par vichaar vimarsh kiya tha or ve koi antim nirnay karne se pehle kendriya samiti main is mudde par phir baat karenge
 Prachanda, Bhattarai and senior leader Mohan Vaidya all presented political circulars
 isaki vajah se desh kii shanti prakriya or nae samvidhan ke gathan ko lekar party kii yojana par koi aam raay nahin ban saki
 Maoist leader Prachanda has already given anti-india statements
 prachand ne yahaan bharat par nepal ke maamalon main dakhal dene or uske netaaon par haaavee hone ke aarope bhi lagaae
 The Maoists also accused India of not forming a government under his leadership

 The party also demanded India to stop interfering in Nepal's affairs

 The market was already anticipating these results, which is why a total of 7 since March by foreign investors

 While domestic institutional investors booked profits of $ 110 billion during this period
 haalanki bazaar ke lihaaj se loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey bada trigar tha, yahi kaaran rahaa ki 22 may ke kaarobaari satr main vicks index 30 fisadi se zyada uchhal gaya

 The world's two largest economies, a trade war between the US and China could put economies around the world in jeopardy
 america kii ore se iran par haal main lagaae gaye pratibandh, kachche tel main ubaal kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 Due to this, high prices of crude oil can also prove to be a hindrance in the growth of the economy
 in sabake upar vaishvik mandi bhi na keval bharat balki duniya bhar ke bazaaron ke liye chintaa kaa sabab bani hui he
 In addition to the factors mentioned above, recent economic data from China, Japan and Europe point to a problem in the global economy

 For example, salvage of cash-strapped NBFC sector due to which the demand for loans is weakening

 This is still high so the government has limited investment options in the economy
 haalanki isse arthvyavastha ko kuch sahaara jarur mil saktaa he
 We have seen government investment slowing down before the election

 We expect capital expenditure to increase in the coming quarters, which will see an improvement in the economy

 Apart from this, the demand for loans will increase

 We believe that with these reforms, the rupee will be strengthened and bond yields will also improve

 Apart from this, profit booking is possible in FMCG companies due to high valuation
 sarkari pratibhutiyaan nivesh ke liye acha vikalp sabit ho sakati hai
 Midcap and smallcap companies will perform well

 As soon as the information was received, the police started a team and started investigating immediately
 shuruaati jaanch main pataa chalaa ki anil bansal kii dukaan par kaam karne vaala kuldeep naamak naukar bhi kaaphi der se gaayab tha
 Kuldeep, a resident of Etah, immediately came under suspicion
 police ne nakaabandi kar di
 And during this time, accused Kuldeep and a forward-looking child were caught from Aligarh district by a bus of Uttar Pradesh Transport
 kuldeep bachche ko lekar eta ja rahaa tha
 On being caught, Kuldeep told the police the truth

 As soon as Shah brought the child along with his team, people started cheering him
 ghar main bachche kii baramadagi par maa ne mithaiyaan banti
 In seven hours, the Delhi Police has done a commendable job by bringing the child to the safe and safe families
 dilli main mahila ayog kii team ne police ke saath milakar pahadganj ilaake ke ek hotel se 39 nepali ladakiyon ko rescue karaayaa he
 For the third time within a week, the Commission team has done such an operation with the police
 is saptaah kul 73 ladakiyon ko chhudaaya gaya he
 Last night, the team of Delhi Women's Commission along with the police reached Raid at Paharganj hotel on the basis of an information
 soochna mili thi ki pichley kuch dinon se yahanepali ladakiyonko laayaa gaya he, jinako duusare deshon main bhejne kii taiyaari he
 When the women's commission team reached the hotel to search and search the records, they found 39 Nepali girls from there
 jinako sidhe pahadganj thane le jaaya gaya
 The hotel employee said that the girls had been staying here for 15 days, all had given Nepal passport as their identity and were coming from the hotel continuously
 dilli police is maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he or ladakiyon kaa medical chekup karaayaa ja rahaa he
 Because the women's commission team said that girls were being prostituted here
 unke saath yon utpeedan bhi ho rahaa tha
 According to the Women's Commission, raids have been made 5 days ago from Munirka in Delhi, Maidan Garhi tomorrow and at Paharganj on Tuesday night
 jinamein kul 73 ladakiyon corescukia gaya he
 Commission Chairman Swati Maliwal alleged that all these girls were to be sold in Gulf countries
 dilli main aae din is tarah ke maamle saamne aa rahe hai, jo hairaan karne vaali baat he
 Police is investigating whether these girls are part of a racket or some other conspiracy behind it
 pichley kareeb 25 saal sachin or bhartiya cricket ke kattar phens master-blaster kaa janmdin aise manaate rahe jaise khud apana janmdin manaa rahe hon
 On this day, the media used to wait for the pictures of Sachin's cake cutting and also the common fans
 sachin ke kek katate hi phens bhi apana janmdin manaa lete the
 Sachin is celebrating his 42nd birthday today, but the hopes of the fans are still the same
 jab wo balla lekar maidan par ja rahe hote or unase centuri kii ummid main phens "sachin
 
 
 
 sachin" ke naare laga rahe hote
 Sachin would then respect the voices of 120 crores fans and the chest of these fans would be widened with pride
 16 navambar, 2013 ko cricket ke maidan ko alavida kehete vaqt sachin or unke phens kii ankhen nam ho gai thim, lekin saath hi saath sachin or unke prashansakon ke bich ye sawaal bhi khadaa ho gaya tha ki aage wo kya karte nazar aaenge
 In the last about 16–17 months, Sachin batted a lot for the Indian Games from outside the cricket field
 inchion main hue asian khelon ke dauraan mahila mukkebaaz sarita devi par aaajeevan prabandh lagaae jane kaa masalaa saamne khadaa tha
 This spice has been solved and due to this, now Sarita Devi is now pushing for the preparation of Rio Olympics, then the big reason is Sachin's efforts
 sachin is dauraan isisi world cap cricket ke brands ambesder rahete hue bhi associat sadasyon kii tarafdaari karte rahe
 He believes that 25 countries should be given a chance to play cricket, only then the popularity of cricket will spread worldwide and justice will also be done to the associate members of the ICC
 sachin kaa sidhe cricket se vaasta ab ipel ke maichon ke dauraan nazar aata he jab wo yuva khiladiyon kii takanic ko thik karte or mumbai indiens kii ranneetiyaan taiyaar karte dikhaai de jate hai
 Sachin has also given a roadmap to the Indian Sports Ministry to get all sports on track
 tippaniyan It is also certain that whatever the pace Sachin should keep his pace, the Indian sports system also has its own pace and there is a big gap between them
 magar phens apni ummid kaise choden? unka hero sachin hai
 For almost two and a half decades, Sachin has lived up to everyone's expectations
 unki duusari pari main sabaki ummiden unase or bad gai hai
 Master Blaster is receiving congratulatory messages from all over the world on his birthday, congratulations to you
 unke berthde ke maukey par soshal netwarking site twitor par # happybirthdaysachin chal rahaa he
 These are a select few of the congratulatory messages

" 
 
 
 "sachin"
 sachin tab 120 karod phens kii awaazon kaa bakhubi maan rakhte or in phens kaa seenaa garv se chaudaa ho jaataa
 On November 16, 2013, Sachin and his fans were moistened while saying goodbye to the cricket ground, but at the same time there was a question between Sachin and his fans that what he would be seen doing next
 pichley kareeb 16-17 maheenon main sachin ne cricket ke maidan ke bahaar se hi bhartiya khelon ke liye khub ballebaazi kii
 During the Asian Games held in Incheon, the issue of life-long management on female boxer Sarita Devi was standing in front
 ye masala sulajhaa or is vajah se ab sarita devi rio olympix kii taiyaari ke liye ab jor laga rahi hai to uski badi vajah sachin kii koshishen hai
 During this period, Sachin remained the brand ambassador of ICC World Cup cricket and also kept favoring the associate members
 unka maananaa he ki 25 deshon ko cricket khilne kaa mauka diya janaa chahie, tabhi cricket kii lokapriyata duniyabar main failegi or isisi ke associat sadasyon ke saath nyaay bhi ho paaegaa
 Sachin's direct connection to cricket is now seen during IPL matches when he is seen fixing the technique of young players and devising strategies for Mumbai Indians
 sachin ne bhartiya khel mantralay ko sabhi khelon ko trek par laane kaa rodmap bhi diya he
 The comments ye bhi tay he ki sachin apni raftaar chaahe jaisi bhi rakhen, bhartiya khel tantra kii bhi apni ek raftaar he or in donon ke bich bada faasla he
 But how do fans give up their hopes? His hero is Sachin
 kareeb dhai dashak tak sachin sabaki umeedo par khara utre hai
 Everyone's hopes in his second innings have increased from him
 master blaster ko duniyabar se janmdin ke maukey par badhai sandesh aa rahe hai, aap bha badhai den

 We are proud of the immense contribution by our sportspersons & i assure them of a just consideration of all issues affecting them
 To save Ram from such an officer, since the time he has come in the sports department, the orders are being issued without head-foot

 Sachin Tendulkar participated in the Mumbai Indians' practice session ahead of IPL 7's first match against Kolkata Knight Riders on Wednesday
 somvaar raat yahaan pahunche mumbai indiens ke khilaadiyon ne shaikh jayed stadium par abhyaas kiya
 Tendulkar, who has said goodbye to all formats of the game last year, has recently been made the icon of this team
 pad pahanakar maidan par utre tendulkar kareeb aadha ghante tak rahe or unki ekaagratha dekhakar aisa lag rahaa tha maano vah antim ekadash main utarane ja rahe hai
 "the way Sachin practiced was a lesson for the youth," said a Mumbai team source
 yadi kisi ne sochaa ki vah maje ke liye kuch gendon ko peetna chaahate the to yah unki galati thi
 He was practicing in the same manner as before the match
 tendulkar ne net par rohit sharma or kirone pollard samet sabhi khilaadiyon ko dekha
 He also spoke to coach John Wright
 vah ipel ke dauraan team sangyojan or ranneetiyon par rhite or captain rohit sharma ko salaah denge

 report ke mutabik dalai lamas mumbai or duusare shaharon main aate rahete hai, isliye aisi chetavanee ko halke main nahin lenaa chahie
 The Dalai Lama's opposing faction, Sugdin, has also been said to be monitored
 aisi ashanka he ki jin chah logon par shaq he, ve china kii khufia agency ke sadsy ho sakate hai
 According to the report, the Dalai Lama keeps coming to Mumbai and other cities, so such warnings should not be taken lightly
 dalai lamas ke virodh karne vaale gut shugadin par bhi najar rakhane kii baat kahi gai he
 It is feared that the six people suspected may be members of China's intelligence agency

 ashok gahalot 9 maheene ke apane kaamkaaj par maangenge votevidhansabha kii 2 siton ke liye 21 oktober ko voting hogirajasthan main do siton par ho rahaa upachunaav mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ke liye badi chunauti he
 On one hand, BJP is confident on the issue of Article 370 and nationalism, while on the other hand Ashok Gehlot has to ask for votes on his 9 months of work
 is baar bhi ashok gahalot chuke to sachin payalat ke sir uthaane kii sambhaavna bani hui he
 Voting is to be held on October 21 for 2 assembly seats in Rajasthan
 inamen se mandava seat par vidhayak rahe narendra kheechad bijepi se jhunjhunu loksabhaa seat se saansad ban gaye hai
 On the other hand Hanuman Beniwal, MLA from Khivansar seat, has become National Democratic Party MP from Nagaur as NDA candidate
 vidhansabha chunaav main jaise-taise jeet hasil karne vaali congress ke liye loksabhaa chunaav kisi bure sapane se kam nahin tha jisamen vah 25 kii 25 siten haar gai
 At that time Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had escaped the pretext of a Modi wave across the country, but this time he has to give details of his 9 months of work in the by-election
 ashok gahalot kah rahe hai ki taiyaari puri he or ham upmukhyamantri sachin payalat ke saath milakar sanghathan ko lekar chunaav ladenge
 In the assembly elections, Mandawa seat Congress lost by 2300 votes
 isliye ummid kii ja rahi he ki pichhali baar ke ummidavaar rita choudhary ko hi congress ripet karegi jabaki bijepi ke liye vahaan par ummidavaar khojna aasaan nahin hoga
 Narendra Khichad, an MP from this seat, has been a two-time MLA
 pehali baar nirdaleey jite the or duusari baar bijepi se jite the
 The Khivansar seat is a big headache for the Congress
 yahaan par hanuman beniwal ne saadhe saat hajaar se zyada voton se use haraaya tha
 The BJP was at the third position
 pradesh main bijepi ne satish punia ko rajasthan bijepi kaa adhyaksh banaaya he
 For the first time in the last 20 years, BJP is going to the polls in the state without Vasundhara Raje
 aise main yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki bina vasundhara ke bijepi apni takat kis kadar dikhaa paati he
 This election will also be a litmus test for the anti-vasundhara group and Satish Poonia will also have to prove that he can take the BJP forward in the state
 bijepi ke liye badi sirdard endie ke ghatak rashtriya loktantric party bhi he
 Which says that he has the right to the Khivansar seat and should get it under the agreement
 hanuman beniwal kaa jat vot bank par kaaphi acha asar he
 In such a situation, the BJP would want Hanuman Beniwal to be used in the Jat dominated Mandawa seat
 magar vasundhara raaje kaa khemaa chaah rahaa he ki hanuman beniwal kii party se koi samjhauta nahin ho
 Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is surely afraid that issues like Article 370 and Nationalism are leaving a lot of impact in the countryside areas of the state and the BJP is cashing it out
 kahin aisa naa ho ki yah chunaav bhi inhen muddon kii bhent chadh jayega
 If this happens, it will become difficult for Ashok Gehlot

 railmantri se jab poocha gaya ki aakhir ye sena kiski he to railmantri ne jawaab diya ki nishchit rup se janata kii
 Then another question was raised on him that it is not bjp's
 tab piyush goyal ne jawaab diya ki bijepi bharat kii janata kii nahin he? bijepi main bhi to bharat kii janata sammilit he
 They have elected us and given a government of absolute majority
 kya main bhi janata nahin hum ? kya mantri ban gaya to aapane mujhe tadeepaar kar diya

 isliye apane gine-chune jite hue parshadon tak ko baar-baar eemaandaaree kii ghutti pilaani padi
 The big question on Kejriwal's dreams and ideals has been raised by Kumar Vishwas, who was once close to him
 kejariwal apni party ko pavitra or eemaandaarbatate hai, lekin kumaar vishwaas ko vishwaas ho chalaa he ki 'aap' ab congress banane lagi he, bhrashtachar ke maamle main
 Now it is not clear whether it is the anger of Kumar Vishwas or indeed the pain for the party, but every word of Kumar Vishwas will be pierced like salt and pepper on the wounds of the loser Kejriwal
 in sabake bich party ke vidhayak amanatulla khan ne jab kumaar vishwaas ko RSS or bijepi kaa agent bataa diya to party kaa ghamaasan khulkar saamne aa gaya
 Kejriwal convinced Tesekumar but the lack of confidence in the party only increased, and it started only when Kejriwal got 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi
 jeet ke baad kejariwal ne party se yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan jaise sansthaapak diggajon ko ek jatke main baahar nikaal phenkaa
 In fact, Kejriwal, who had a lot of trouble or whoever raised an inch of finger on the leadership, kept Kejriwal out
 isko jaanane ke liye aapako itihaas main thodaa peeche janaa hoga
 Anna Hazare was leading the movement against corruption in 2011
 lekin uski sari planning arvind kejariwal ne kii thi
 During that period, in the movement, which was not made by Kejriwal, they were shown the way out or they had made their way, whether Swami Agnivesh or Justice Santosh Hegde or Aam Aadmi Party's founding member Shanti Bhushan
 or baad main to shajia ilmi tak AAP se baahar nikal gayi, jo kabhi kejariwal ko sabase eemaandaar maanati thim, aaj sabase bhrasht bataati hai
 Many party veterans and leaders with a clean image went out and among the remaining, many ministers were accused of serious charges
 - kejariwal sarkaar ke ek mantri sandip kumaar ko sex sidi aane ke baad istipha dena padaa
 - Another minister of Kejriwal, Asim Khan, lost the chair on the charge of recovery from the builders
 - bas ghotaale ke aarope main gopal raay se transport vibhaag lekar satyendra jain ko de diya gaya
 Jitendra Tomar, who was the Law Minister in the Kejriwal government, had to lose the chair and also go to jail on charges of fake degrees
 - abakapil mishrako vibhaag main kaam naa karne ke chalate hataaya gaya
 In Gurgaon, Haryana, a man was shot dead by unknown miscreants in Delhi in broad daylight and Tammanha, who was used in the attack, escaped by throwing him on the spot
 ghayal shaks ko aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 Where his condition remains critical
 ghatana gudgaanv ke sector 9 kii he
 The victim has been identified as 35-year-old Trilok Chand
 jo bhavani enklev main rahete hai
 At around eight thirty in the morning, he was going to Trilok Chand from his scooty towards Sector 9 for some work
 tabhi agyaat badmaashon ne trilok kii peeth main goli maar di or tamancha vahiin phenkakar faraar ho gaye
 Shortly after the incident, the injured Trilok Chand was admitted to a private hospital there
 jahaan unki haalat gambhir bani hui he
 As soon as the information was received, the police reached the spot and investigated
 tabhi police ne hamale main istemaal kiya gaya tamancha bhi baraamad kar liya
 Now the police are scanning the footage of CCTV cameras installed around the mauka-e-vardat
 taaki hamalaavaron kii pahchaan kii ja sake
 The police claim that the accused miscreants will be arrested soon
 dindahaade hui isvaardaatse jahaan ilaake main dehshat kaa maahaul he, vahiin bekhauf badmaashon ke haunsale itane buland hai ki ve gudgaon police ke seva suraksha jaise daavon kii dhajjiyaan uda rahe hai

 This time the BJP has cut the ticket of its sitting mps in large numbers
 aisa in saansadon ke khilaaf unke chunaav kshetron main gusse ko kam karne ke liye kiya gaya he
 BJP has so far announced 437 candidates
 uske abhi lok sabha main 270 saansad hai
 Of these, 102 mps have not been renominated
 yani kareeb 38 pratishat saansadon ke tikat kaat die gaye hai
 The BJP used a large number of ticket cutting formulas in the assembly elections of Narendra Modi as the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 party ko iskaa phayda bhi mila tha
 This is the reason why this formula has now been implemented in the Lok Sabha also
 bijepi ne chhattisgarh main sabhi das maujuuda saansadon ke tikat kaat die hai
 Apart from this, a large number of mps' tickets have also been cut in Uttar Pradesh
 madhya pradesh, rajasthan or maharashtra main bhi kai saansadon ko dobaaraa mauka nahin mila he
 These include veteran leaders like Lal Krishna Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi, Shanta Kumar, Sumitra Mahajan, BC Khanduri, Kalraj Mishra, who have not been re-nominated by the BJP due to the completion of 75 years of age
 aisa karne main congress bhi peeche nahin he
 However, Congress mps are few
 phir bhi usne apane 16 saansadon ko dobaaraa tikat nahin diya he
 That is, about 33 percent of the Congress mps could not get a chance again
 ashok uniwarsity kii madad se jutaaye gaye aankadon se pataa chalaa he ki agar nae ummidavaaron kii baat karen ton bijepi ne 243 nae ummidavaaron ko mauka diya he
 While the Congress has fielded 304 new candidates
 haalanki donon hi partiyon ke tikat kaatane ke tareeke main ek samanta dekhi gai he
 To reduce the anti-incumbency wave, both the national parties have slapped more on mps of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe
 bijepi ke paas maujuuda lok sabha main arakshit varg ke 63 saansad hai
 Of these, 33 mps have not been given a second chance
 yani 52 pratishat se bhi adhik dalit adivasee saansad dobaaraa tikat nahin paa sake hai
 Whereas more than 33 percent of the general category mps have been cut tickets
 bijepi ne saamaanya varg ke 69 jabaki arakshit varg ke 33 saansadon ke tikat kaate hai
 Congress has done the same
 congress ke arakshit varg ke saat saansad hai jinamein se teen ko chunaav main khadaa nahin kiya gaya he
 This figure is around 43 percent
 jabaki congress ne saamaanya varg ke 23 pratishat saansadon ke hi tikat kaate hai
 The Congress has cut the ticket for 13 general category and three reserved category mps

 apane vichaaron se swami vivekanand ne duniya ke bich bharat kaa danka bajaayaa
 At a time when India was considered inferior to the rest of the world, Swami Vivekananda surprised people from all over the world by giving an effective speech on Hinduism on 11 September 1883 at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago

 On Swami Vivekananda's birthday, know 10 of his thoughts, which you can adopt and improve the way you think and live, and listen to Swami Vivekananda's memorable speech at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1883
 1
 Tell the people truthfully, boldly
 usase kisi ko ksht hota he yaa nahin, is ore dhyaan mat do
 Never allow weakness sach kii jyoti ‘budhimaan’ manushyon ke liye yadi atyadhik maatra main prakhar prathit hoti he or unhen baha le jaati he
 So let it be carried, the sooner they flow, the better
 2
 Do not bow your head in front of someone else except your inner soul
 jab tak tum yah anubhav nahin karte ki tum swayan devon ke dev ho, tab tak tum mukt nahin ho sakate
 3
 ishwar hi ishwar kii uplabdhi kar saktaa he
 All are living Gods
 is bhav se sab ko dekho
 Study man, man is living poetry
 jagat main jitne isa yaa buddha hue hai
 All are lighted by our light
 is jyoti ko chhod dene par ye sab hamaare liye or adhik jivit nahin rah sakenge
 Will die tum apni aatma ke upar sthir raho

 There is no reason to fear, Mother is with me
 is baar aise kaary honge ki tum chakit ho jaaoge
 What is fear Whose fear? Get involved in work by making a heart like thunderbolt
 6
 You are not enthusiastic about anything
 jab tak ishwar kii krupa hamaare upar he, koun is prithvi par hamaari upeksha kar saktaa he? yadi tum apni antim saans bhi le rahe ho to bhi na darana
 Keep working with the valor of the lion and the softness of the flower
 7
 Whether people praise you or blasphemy, Lakshmi should be compassionate on you or not, is your death today or in an era, you are never corrupt from justice
 swami vivekanand kii kahani unheen kii jubaani8
 Work courageously
 dhiraj or sthirataa se kaam karnaa, yahi ek maarg he
 Move ahead
 or yaad rakho dhiraj, saahas, pavitrataa or anwarat karm
 As long as you become holy, you will stand on your purpose
 tab tak tum kabhi nishphal nahin honge
 Mother will never leave you and you will be eligible for full blessings
 9
 Move forward heroically
 ek din yaa ek saal main sidhdi kii aashaa na rakho
 Stand firm on the highest ideal
 sthir raho
 Avoid selfishness and jealousy
 ajna-paalan karo
 Truth, always stand firm on the side of mankind and your country, and you will shake the world
 yaad rakho
 The person and his life are the source of power, except nothing else
 10
 Shields and swords are required to defeat the enemy
 isliye angreji or sanskrit kaa adhyayan man lagaakar karo
 All obstacles are overcome through purity, patience and effort
 isamen koi sandeh nahin ki mahaan kaary sabhi dhire dhire hote hai

 VIDEO: rantunga pehle bhi uthaate rahe hai sawaal When Judge Madhusudan Sharma pronounced the verdict in Jodhpur jail, Asaram was convicted, he lost his face
 kuch pal shant rahakar vah ram naam japane laga or phir achaanak vah naatakeey andaaj main hansane laga
 After this, he also pleaded for mercy with the judge
 phir asaram ne vakeelon ke kandhe par haath rakhkar kaha- kuch to bolo
 After this, when the judge sentenced Asaram to life imprisonment, he cried in court
 5 saal puraane yon shoshan ke maamle menasaram baapuko jodhpur kii adaalat ne doshi qaraar de diya
 Court was put in jail for security reasons
 jaj madhusudan maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the
 He reached the court at the appointed time in the morning and summoned the accused
 sabhi aropiyon ke aa jane ke baad jaj ne asaram ko bulaayaa
 He was not there
 adaalat kii karrwai shuru ho chuki thi, lihaaja jaj madhusudan sharma ne asaram ko laane ke liye kaha to bataaya gaya ki vah puja kar rahaa he
 Then he reached the judge after 15 minutes
 tabhi asaram ke vakil ne jaj se kaha ki ve unke saamne kuch kahana chaahate hai
 On this, Judge Sharma told the lawyer that nothing has to be heard now
 cese kii sunwaayee puri ho chuki he
 Now is the time for decision
 iske baad jaj sharma ne apane stano se kareeb do pej tip karaae
 After a while, he pronounced Asaram guilty while delivering the verdict
 asaram ke saath shilpi or sharatchand ko bhi jaj ne doshi qaraar diya
 But the judge acquitted him, citing Shiva and Prakash's young age
 faisla sunate hi asaram kaa cheharaa kaa utar gaya
 He looked very disappointed
 vah ram naam kaa jaap karne laga
 And after some time he started laughing
 isi dauraandalatne aage kii karrwai shuru kar di
 Government lawyers began to argue for severe punishment for Asaram and the sentence started to be debated
 isi bich faisla sunne ke baad asaram ne jaj se kaha ki vah boodha ho gaya he
 Have mercy on him lekin jaj ne uski baton par koi pratikriya nahin di
 An army of lawyers was present on behalf of Asaram in the special court set up in Jodhpur jail
 uski pairvi karne ke liye court main 14 vakil maujuud the
 Anna Hazare has been facing lack of public support for quite some time
 khaskar apni reliyon main
 Millions of people reached the 2011 Ramlila movement
 ab ve paanch hajaar logon ke aane kii baat karte hai or hajaar log bhi nahin pahunchate hai
 Anna is again in Delhi to protest against the Land Acquisition Bill
 pichhali raat maharashtra bhawan main ranneeti bani ki kis tarah se anna or kejariwal ko ekasaath manch par laayaa jaae
 So that the pair's three-year-old status can be returned
 lekin ab ye sambhav nahin he-1
 Anna and Kejriwal have spoken against each other a lot: there is a fundamental opposition between Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal, partners of India Against Corruption
 20 sitambar 2012 ko yah virodh dikhaa us samay jab kejariwal ne apane ek pole ke hawaale se kaha ki unke 76 fisadi samarthak chaahate hai ki ve chunaav main utren
 Anna opposed this, saying that money is needed to contest elections and for this, values have to be compromised
 kejariwal ade rahe to anna yahaan tak kah gaye ki ve mere naam or mere photo kaa istemaal karnaa band kar den
 When Anna agreed with the Lokpal bill tabled in Parliament by the UPA government, Kejriwal tweeted in vivid words how 'anna agreed to the government jokpal'
 rochak to yah he ki congress or bijepi donon isse sahamat hai'
 2
 ab kejariwal gaiyr-raajnneetik nahin rahe:anna hajaare janalokapal andolan ke dauraan kejariwal kii tarif karte nahin thakte the
 Kejriwal is not associated with any party
 badi sarkari naukari chhodkar desh seva main aae hai
 Wears slippers and simple shirt-pants
 lekin jab kejariwal ne aam aadmi party kaa gathan kiya to anna ne kejariwal ke bare main bolnaa band kar diya
 a few days later, the allegations and counter-allegations between the two started being like any common leaders
 anna peeche chhot gaye or kejariwal siyasat main pad gaye
 Now this distance is impossible to end
 3
 Non-political people have lost interest: In the 2011 anti-corruption movement, common people and organizations from every corner of the country gave their support to Team Anna
 ramlila maidan par anna ke samarthan main lakhon log pahunche
 But as soon as there was a split in this team and Kejriwal and his team formed a political party, the common people lost confidence in this movement
 is bich anna ne mumbai main bandra-kurlaa complex ke paas bhrashtachar ke mudde par hi anshan shuru kiya
 50 thousand people were claimed to have arrived, but even five thousand people did not arrive
 unhone dilli main phir se andolan khadaa karne kii koshish kii, lekin yah prayaas bhi asafal rahaa
 4
 anna to aar-paar kii ladaai kar sakate hai lekin kejariwal ab nahin:bhoomi adhigrahan kaa mudda ek rashtriya mudda he, jo khaskar kisaanon se judaa hua he
 Since Anna is connected to the village, he can strongly favor it
 lekin kejariwal kaa maamla ab doosraa ho gaya he
 Recently, the people of Delhi have chosen him as the head of state
 bhoomi adhigrahan kaa mudda dilli ke logon se bahut zyada judaa hua nahin he
 In such a situation, Kejriwal will not be able to do much struggle in this matter
 ve anna ke saath sankethik rup se hi judenge
 5
 bhoomi adhigrahan kaa mudda bhrashtachar ke mudde jaisaa vyapak nahin ho paaya:2011 main team anna ko jaisaa samarthan mila tha, vaisaa samarthan ab milanaa mushkil he
 Because then one after the other scams were cropping up in the country
 adarsh ghotaalaa, 2ji ghotaalaa, koyala ghotaalaa, kaamanwealth ghotaalaa aadi
 There was anger among common people
 anna ne us gusse ko manch de diya
 He also brought a solution in the form of Jan Lokpal
 jisamen bhrasht logon par karrwai ke liye kade upaay sujhaaye gaye the
 But most of the population is not aware of the land acquisition bill
 or vah sidhe taur par usase judi hui bhi nahin he
 What Anna or Kejriwal wants, then, is also unclear
 aise main jansamarthan simit hi rahane kii ummid he
 Despite all these things, Anna and Kejriwal are coming together again
 anna ne aam aadmi party ko is andolan main shaamil hone kii sahmati di he
 The issue of Anna and land acquisition will only help Kejriwal in his national expansion

 dilli vidhansabha main sarkaar ne waite sanshodhan visheyak pesh kiya he jiske mutabiq ab 11 utpaada ke upar waite kii dar badhaane kaa yaa ghataane kaa faisla cabinet ko lene kaa adhikaar de diya he
 That is, the government will not have to come to the assembly to take a decision on how much VAT is on these products
 jo 11 saamaan is list main hai unamem petrol, mombatti, sharaab, paanch hazaar se upar kii ghadi, cold drink, lottery tikat, tambaaku or gutkha hai
 All these currently have a maximum VAT limit of 20 per cent
 iskaa matlab he ki sarkaar philhal in saamaanon par zyada se zyada 20 fisadi kii dar se waite lag saktaa he
 But now the government has been authorized to take the decision of increasing it to 30 percent anytime through the cabinet
 dilli vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa vijendra gupta ne kaha ki sarkaar apni hi baat main virodhabhas kar rahi he or dohari baat karke jhooth bol rahi he
 According to Gupta, the government had said in the budget that the rate of VAT will not increase and now the government is increasing it and we condemn it
 dilli ke dipti siem or vitt mantri manish sisodiya ne kaha ki mahangaai badhane yaa waite badhane kaa prastaav nahin he, ye keval waite ke rate ko lacheela banane ke liye kiya ja rahaa he or koi bhi rate main badhotaree yaa katautee puri study ke baad hogi, abhi waite badhaane kaa koi prastaav nahin he
 The comments asal main dilli sarkaar ne pichley dinon 4 or rajyon uttar pradesh, haryana, punjab or himachal pradesh ke saath baithak karke is baat par sahmati banaayi thi ki in sabhi rajyon main waite kii dar ek saamaan ho
 That is, with the change in this act, the government can reduce or increase VAT by simply meeting a cabinet to keep pace with the rest of the states, no need to come to the assembly again and again
 lekin isamen dilli waalon ko shankaa isi baat par ho sakati he ki kya waite ke rate bad sakate hai? kyonki dilli sarkaar ke paas kul aamadani kaa 70 fisadi waite se aata he or dilli sarkaar ne lakshya rakhaa he ki pichley saal jahaan 17000 karod rupee usko waite mila tha abaki baar lakshya badhaakar 24000 karod rupee rakhaa gaya he
 The 11 items in this list include petrol, candles, liquor, clock above five thousand, cold drinks, lottery tickets, tobacco and gutkha
 in sabhi par abhi waite kii adhiktam seemaa 20 fisadi he
 This means that the government can levy VAT at the rate of 20 per cent on these goods at the moment
 lekin sarkaar ab cabinet ke zariye kabhi bhi isko 30 fisadi tak karne kaa faisla lene ke liye adhikrut ho gayi
 Leader of the Opposition in Delhi Legislative Assembly Vijendra Gupta said that the government was contradicting its own stand and lying by talking double
 gupta ke mutabiq sarkaar ne bajet main kaha tha ki waite kii dar nahin badhengi or ab sarkaar ye badha rahi he or ham isaki ninda karte hai
 Delhi Deputy CM and Finance Minister Manish Sisodia said that there is no proposal to increase inflation or increase VAT, it is being done only to make the rate of VAT flexible and any rate increase or reduction will be done after the whole study, Currently there is no proposal to increase VAT
 tippaniyan In fact, the Delhi government had held a meeting recently with 4 more states Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh and agreed that the VAT rate should be the same in all these states
 yani is act main badlaav se sarkaar baaki ke rajyon ke saath talmail baitaane ke liye kabhi bhi bas ek cabinet kii baithak karke waite gata yaa badha sakati he, baar-baar vidhansabha aane kii zarurat nahin
 But in this, the people of Delhi may have doubts on whether VAT rates can be increased? Because Delhi government has 70% of the total income from VAT and the Delhi government has targeted that last year, where it got VAT of Rs 17000 crore, now the target has been increased to Rs 24000 crore

 is saal kaa nobel shanti puraskaar nahin milane se thodi niraash kishor umr kii pakistani kaaryakarta malala usufji ne kaha ki use abhi bahut kaam karne kii jarurat he
 Malala, who was the victim of the Taliban attack last year, told a news channel after announcing the award of this year's Nobel Peace Prize to the Chemical Weapons Prohibition Organization (OPCW), she (nobel Peace Prize Committee) took the right decision because i am very much need work
 usne kaha, agar ham nobel shanti puraskaar ko lekar liye gaye faisle ko bhul jaaen to mujhe lagata he ki mujhe logon ne apana puraskaar de diya he
 He nominated me and this is the biggest award for me
 malala ne kaha, or mere man main ek puraskaar he - jiske liye main sangharsh karuungi, jiske liye main abhiyaan chalaaungi
 The award is to see every child going to school
 main apni jindagi iske liye laga duungi kyonki main apane jivan main yahi puraskaar paanaa chaahati hum
 Malala said that she wants to return to her country and fight terrorism
 usne kaha, pakistan vah desh he jahaan meraa janm hua, or main pakistan kii ek deshbhakt naagarik hum tathaa apane desh se pyaar karti hum
 i want to be true to my country
 mujhe puri ummid he ki main waapas pakistan jaaoongi kyonki main vahaan aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladanaa chaahati hum
 Malala said, i want to fight for girls who are deprived of education

 Because of this i hope and i think that if i empower myself with education, get knowledge, then it will be much easier for me to succeed in my cause

 This week's national interest is on two subjects on which i have little ability to write: cinema and Kashmiri separatism
 cinema kaa mujhe koi gyaan nahin he jisamen cricket ke baad visheshgyon kii duusari sabase badi fouj bharat main maujuud he
 The moment Kashmiri separatism reached its peak, i had become so old, senior and (with regret, but unavoidably) so editorial that i would have been able to go out and report
 is sabake baad bhi agar main vishaal bharadwaj kii film haidar se uthe tufaan main utarane ko raji hua hum to yah bharat ke paripakv rajnatik cinema kii mukhyadhara ko utani hi aadarajuli he jitani desh ke logon kii badhati paripakvata kaa sammaan
 Hyder's Boycott campaign has been fierce on social media and is being blamed for a variety of the worst things — anti-india, anti-army, anti-hindu, and even more, anti-lord Shiva (film a major dance is filmed in the ruins of the old Martand temple)
 to bhi haidar acchhee chali or anek log boycott ke aahvaan ko dhata bataate hue dekhne gaye
 It shows that even in this era of conservative and narrow hyper-nationalism, as a society we are growing up and are now more ready than ever to look within ourselves and accept that there can be another aspect of the picture
 Is, no matter how disappointing it is
 main aisa isliye kah rahaa hum kyonki abhi mahaj ek saal pehle ek or mahatvapurn rajnatik film madras cafe ne bhi vyavsaayik safalataa or aalochakon kii tarif donon batori thi
 The film, more than Haider, was the story of the failure of the Indian Army and intelligence in Sri Lanka
 beshak tamilnadu main iske khilaaf kuch pradarshan hue the, lekin isane apni vidha kii kisi bhi duusari raajnneetik film se behatar pradarshan kiya tha or vah bhi sachaai ko hakeekat yaa border kaa rup die bagaiyr
 The last two names are meant to remind us of the two most successful 'war' films in our history
 maine ye do filmein isliye chunin kyonki ek paraajay (1962, ladakh) or duusari vijay (1971, longevala) kii kahani thi
 The two shared some very important things
 bhartiya javaanon kii bahaduree, vishwasghaat, yahaan tak ki dushman kaa naakaaraapan or, record kii khatir, deol chhap ugrata kii ek jhalak bhi
 Chetan Anand did Kaifi Azmi kar Hum Fida jaan-o-tan Saathio on Rejang La
 
 
 par hriday-vidaarak dhun kii prishthbhumi main dharmendra ko marate hue dikhaaya tha, jabaki 30 saal baad je
 P
 datta kii border main sani deol vijeta sikh major hai, jo nange haathon se paton tanks phod saktaa tha
 Reality was a bold film in its own time, which made the best possible defense of our army
 isane is dharna ko pukhta kar diya ki us paraajay ke liye hamaari sena ke general nahin, balki hindustani netaaon kii bujadili or china kaa vishwasghaat jimmedaar tha
 This mythic belief remains today even after three generations and that is why no government wants to highlight the Henderson brooks-bhagat report
 duusari ore, datta kii kahin zyada kundadimagi se grast film border ne ek bilkul nai galpakatha kii shuruyaat kii or vah yah ki bharat kii fouj ko pakistani fouj ke upar sampurna maharath hasil he
 This fantasy coincided well with joshua-kharosh, who grew up immediately after this, Pokaran-2 and Kargil
 iske baad to aisi tathakthith yuddh filmon kii baadh hi aa gai jinamein yaa to deol yaa usase miltaa-julata koi kirdaar bevakoof pakistaniyon ko chakanachur kar rahaa hota tha
 This trend continued till the Hindustani audience got bored and every film made after Kargil flopped badly
 isaki ek vajah yah bhi thi ki ab tak log asli sipaahiyon kii bhoomika se saji-dhaji vah 'film’ televijan ke news channelon par dekh chuke the
 Perhaps the premise that Vishal has built is that mainstream cinema has for the first time had a constructive encounter with our inner rivalry, and that too on the issue of sharing and shaking like Kashmir
 jahaan tak mujhe yaad he, aisi ekmaatr duusari koshish naga vidroh kii prishthbhumi par 1972 main bani or dev anand tathaa sharmila tagore ke abhinay main atmaram kii film ye gulistaan hamaara main kii gai thi
 The film was as absurd and silly as any of Sunny Deol's exaggerated films and was shattered in theaters showing it in Calcutta as it depicted the Chinese as demons! Three decades have passed since Operation Bluestar was completed and Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale was established and the Khalistani revolt was buried two decades ago, even though Bollywood is living in this silence as if it had never happened
 ekmaatr apwaad agar koi he to vah he gulzaar kii saahsee film maachis—haalanki us story ko maine vistaar se cover kiya tha, lekin uske baad bhi mere usase matbhed the or unhone meri daleelein bhi suni thim
 Similarly, many people have the right to disagree with Haider and its portrayal of Kashmir
 lekin pratibandh yaa bahishkaar, katai nahin
 Assuming there is a story for the 'other' side of Kashmir, only a typical Indian filmmaker can take responsibility for its investigation
 isi tarah, bhartiya sensor board ke niyantaa, sena or sabase zyada paisa dekar film dekhne vaali janata tarif kii hakdaar he ki haidar is rup main, apane yantranaa kakshon vagairah ke saath, pradarshit ho saki he or ati-rashtrawaad ko dhata bataakar vyavsaayik kamyaabi bhi hasil kar saki
 Commercial films risk their investment, reputations and physical security, especially at a time when blind nationalism has come to dominate conscience, self-questioning patriotism
 aapako saahsee or khaas taur par deshbhakt bhartiya hona padataa he tabhi aap is baat kii padtaal kar sakate hai ki kya duusare paksh kaa, is maamle main mul bashindon kashmiriyon kaa, bhi koi kathanak, koi najariya yaa koi aakhyaan he
 Consider, too, that despite my thick skin after spending nearly four decades in journalism, i too, with careless caution, preferred the use of the word 'native' instead of Indian to our Kashmiri compatriots
 nahin, meraa yah matlab nahin he ki ve bhartiya nahin hai
 But if i used to call Haider, his father and father, and Chachazan and Mashuka as 'indian' Kashmiris, what would you like me to call those half-brothers and sisters across the Line of Control? This is just a small example of how complex and sensitive the issue is

 But the most important thing is how each side looks at this issue

 "the militants who fought for Pakistan, who never take care of how many Kashmiris have lost their lives
" or khud kashmiri, jo 'do haathiyon kii ladaai main ghaas kii tarah kuchle’ ja rahe hai
 They have been brutally put to the test for conflicting two national ideologies — Pakistan's two-nation theory versus secularism

 No army likes to fight its own people, and that too for decades

 The dilemma and confusion of this impossible soldier, moral and psychological challenge is depicted very brilliantly
 interogeshan chambers, yantranaa or utpeeda, gumshudagiyaan, luutmaar, khufia agenciyon ke haathon khadey kiye gaye hatyare sipaahi (kukhyat kuka pare or ikhwaan sargana kii yaad he?), sabko pramanik dhang se bakhubi sanjoya gaya he
 In a full and confident democracy, you expect that in popular culture there will be scope for truth-telling and reconciliation
 yahi kaam america main hollywood ne kiya tha
 For example, when he portrayed the American soldier's suffering and confusion on the screen in Vietnam, and recently Clint Eastwood examined Evo Jima from both the American and Japanese aspects (flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Eva Jima) 
 isse na to america kamjor hua or na hi uski fouj badnaam hui
 India has been the victim of excesses in contrast

 ek shaam ek ekant sarahadi chaowkee par ned ne commander se poocha ki vah bharat kaa paksh apane sainikon ko kis tarah samajhate hai
 Do they not be misled by enemy propaganda and Kashmiri hatred? The officer said, don't ask me, ask my soldiers
 to hamane sainikon se poocha

 Know what to do after the lunar eclipse so that its negativity is completely eliminated
 
 
 1
 Take a bath in the morning and wear only washed clothes
 2
 Clothing worn at the time of eclipse should be donated to a poor person
 3
 Only after taking bath enter the house of worship
 4
 After the lunar eclipse is over, purify the idols of the Gods located in the house by sprinkling Ganga water
 5
 Donate three dried coconuts and one and a quarter kilogram Satanaja in the morning or let the water flow
 6
 Also remember your fathers and donate them to the poor in their name
 7
 If you have a temple near your home, then go there and offer worship
 8
 Similarly, if there is a ghat near your house, then go there and worship Shiva
 isse nakaaratmak urja kaa asar kam hoga

 In his speech, the Congress president highlighted the failures of the Modi government, while also responding to personal attacks from the BJP
 itnaa hi nahin, rahul gandhi shuukravaar ko sadan main kaaphi aakraamak dikhe
 He tried to surround the ruling party in the same way
 yahaan tak ki hindu hone kaa matlab samajhane ke liye unhone piem modi ke paas jaakar unhen gale tak laga liya
 But after this, when he came to his seat and looked at one of his fellow mps, he turned his eyes to see the picture of Rahul's entire speech
 jiske baad unke is andaaj par alag-alag pratikriyaayein aa rahi hai
 BJP leaders are strongly criticizing this style of Rahul
 yahaan tak ki loksabhaa spikar sumitra mahajan ne bhi is ravaiye ko galat tehraaya he
 But did Rahul sit in the house making a mistake by doing this? Or is it a sample of his political immaturity, about which BJP leaders have often given statements
 philhal rahul ke is ravaiye ko alag-alag tareeke se aanka ja rahaa he, lekin ateet main jaaen to pataa chalata he ki rahul pehle bhi aise andaaj main najar aa chuke hai

 -input language 98 saal kii umr main marshall of indian airforce arjan singh kaa nidhan aaj hi ke roj 16 sitambar 2017 ko dil kaa daura padane se ho gaya tha
 He was the most senior of the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the only Marshal with five star ranks
 arjan singh ko 1965 main bharat-pakistan yuddh main ahm bhoomika nibhaane ke liye yaad kiya jaataa he
 Let's know how they had decided Pakistan's defeat in 1 hour
 arjan singh 44 saal kii umr main hi bhartiya vaayu sena kaa netritv karne kii jimmedaari di gai thi, jise unhone shandaar tareeke se nibhaayaa
 Arjan Singh, who flew more than 60 different types of aircraft, was instrumental in making the Indian Air Force one of the most powerful air forces in the world and the fourth largest air force in the world
 60 saal kii umr tak udaae vimaansarvocch rank hasil karne ke baad bhi sevanivrutt hone se thik pehle tak arjan singh vimaan udaate the
 In his military life of several decades, he flew 60 types of aircraft
 jinamein dwitiya vishwa yuddh se pehle ke tathaa baad main samasamyik vimaanon ke saath-saath parivahan vimaan bhi shaamil the
 Arjan Singh was conferred with martial rank on the occasion of Republic Day in 2002
 bataa den, arjan singh na keval nidar payalat the, balki unhen air force kii gahari jaankaree thi
 He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian honor in the country in 1965
 padhaiarjan singh kaa janm 15 april 1919 ko lailpur (ab pakistan) main hua tha
 At the age of 19 RAF was selected for the Empire Pilot Training Course at Cranwell
 1939 main ek payalat adhikari ke rup main niyukti pai thi
 He then led the Indian Air Force's No
1 Squadron during the Arakan Expedition in 1944
 
 
 
 When Pakistan's defeat in 1 hour was decided in 1965, Pakistan carried out "operation Grand Slam" against India and Pakistani tanks attacked the Akhnoor district of Jammu and Kashmir
 us dauraan arjan singh kii yah sabase badi chunauti thi ki kaise pakistan ko munh tod jawaab diya jaae
 He led the Indian Air Force to teach Pakistan a lesson and played a pivotal role in the 1965 war with Pakistan
 aapako bataa den, pakistani hamale kii khabar milte hi jab raksha mantralay ne sabhi sena pramukhon ko kaha ki kuch der kii meeting ne bulaayaa to arjan singh ne poocha vah kitni jaldi pakistan ke badhate tinkon ko rokane ke liye air force kaa hamalaa kar sakate hai
 On this bus Arjan Singh said that we need only 1 hour

 After which Pakistan had to face it
 kya tha oparation grand slamoparation grand slam ke tahat pakistani raashtrapati or general ayub khan ne jabaran kashmir par kabja karne kii yojana banaai
 Experts believe that this attack of Pakistan was capable of occupying Kashmir
 lekin general ayub khan ne bhartiya sena or bhartiya vaayu sena kii kshamta ke bare main maaloom nahin tha
 Therefore, Pakistan's entire plan failed due to the attack of the Indian Air Force in the first hour of the attack
 jiske baad unke haath kuch na laga
 (marshal Arjan Singh with fellow military officers) Arjan Singh never retired Arjan Singh was a 5 star rank officer of the army

 On the poster, it is written with the greetings of Holi, 'bole Kashi Vishwanath, Dr
 joshi kaa denge saath'
 This slogan has brought Modi and Joshi activists face to face
 murali manohar joshi ke samarthakon kaa kahana he ki janata unka saath degi
 At the same time, after putting up the posters, Modi supporters have come out openly and are announcing the Modi wave
 donon netaaon ke samarthakon kii baton se sanket mil rahe hai ki kahin na kahin koi virodhabhas to he
 Tilak Raj, media in-charge of the metropolis, says, 'modi ji is a wave

 Joshi supporters there are not tired of calling them senior leaders
 party netaa ashok pandeya ne kaha, 'joshi ji ne is shahar ke liye bahut kuch kiya he or unhen chunaav ladanaa chahie
 The Lok Sabha seat of Varanasi is a special issue for the BJP this time
 party ko ummid he ki agar modi yahaan se chunaav ladate hai to isse upi-bihar kii siton par use kaaphi phayda hoga

 After killing a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite using a space missile, India now intends to launch a surveillance satellite through a mission of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), which will be the first of many things
 yah pehali baar hoga jab bhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan (ISRO) aam logon ko apana rocket launch dekhne ke liye aamantrit kar rahaa he

 Sivan says, "the mission we are currently targeting is the PSLV C-45
 yah mishan is lihaaj se vishesh he ki yah pehali baar PSLV kii ek hi flite main thri orbit mishan hoga
 The ISRO chief said, 'initially the first main satellite will be launched in an orbit of 763 km
 or uske baad 504 kilometre tak kii kaksha main pahunchane ke liye PS4 do baar kaam karegaa
 There PSLV will launch 28 other satellites and then after that the PS4 will be lit twice to reach 485 km orbit
 vahaan PS4 orbital placeform ke rup main kaam karegaa

 Till now, India used planes as early warning platforms for this, but with the help of this satellite, it would help in locating the enemy's radars from space itself

 BJP has suffered the biggest blow in the state in Saurashtra, which is called the fort of BJP
 is kshetra main pichley chunaav ke mukaable party kii 12 siten kam hui hai
 Looking at the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP is already busy fixing its fort

 In such a situation, they can surround the government in the House on the issue related to farmers

 In such a situation, there is a big challenge for the BJP to improve its position both in the farmers and the Patidars

 a woman from Bihar's Vaishali district has decided to divorce her husband, as her husband did not build a toilet in the house
 darasal, 25 saal kii sunita devi kii shaadi saal 2011 main dhiraj choudhary se hui thi
 They had no children
 vaishali kii pahadpur-bisanpur panchayat main rahane vaali is mahila ne lagaataar apane pati se shauchalay banavane ko kaha, lekin uske pati ne uski shauchalay banavaane kii maang par dhyaan nahin diya
 Whenever she went out to defecate in the open, she had to listen to her husband's constant taunts and snitches
 akhirkaar sunita ne tay kar liya ki ab bahut hua, vah ab khule main shouch ke liye jane ko majaboor nahin hogi or apane pati ke lagaataar taane or fabtiyaan nahin sunegi
 She then sent the news to her husband through her lawyer that she could no longer continue the marriage, as there is no toilet in her house and which her husband is not even ready to build
 bharat main khaastaur par gaanvon main shauchalay kii kami jaisi samasya par dhyaan diya jaae to yah ujagar hoga ki gramin ilaaqon main lakhon logon ke liye khule main shouch ek sachai he or khaaskar auraton ko ghar main shauchalay na hone se taane or kaaphi kuch jhelana padataa he, kyonki ve khule main shouch karti hai, vah bhi zyaadaatar andhere main
 Sunita's husband also believes that there was a rift in their relationship due to lack of toilets in the house, but he also believes that he did not have the money to build a toilet
 gaanv main shauchalay kii samasya par najar daalen to, haal hi main praapt aankadon ke mutabik-tippaniyan 82 percent of Bihar's rural households do not have toilets -15 saal puraani ek sarkari yojana 'nirmal bharat abhiyaan' ke tahat desh ke har ghar ko toilet banane ke liye kareeb 10,000 rupee milane chahie - The Central Government is giving a new thrust to this scheme
 lekin mushkil ye he ki zyaadaatar maamalon main ye paisa na to puraa padataa he, na hi iskaa koi hisaab-kitaab rakhaa jaataa he or kai maamalon main to yah paisa ghar tak pahunchataa hi nahin
 Ironically, in 2011, a panchayat named paharpur-bishanpur was declared as Nirmal Gram by the central government, stating that the place is open defecation free
 iskaa jawaab dene vaala koi nahin he ki aisi ghoshnaa kaise kii gai? The woman, who lives in paharpur-bishanpur panchayat of Vaishali, constantly asked her husband to build toilets, but her husband did not pay attention to her demand to build toilets
 jab bhi vah khule main shouch ke liye jaati, use apane pati ke lagaataar taane or fabtiyaan sunani padatin
 Ultimately, Sunita decides that enough is enough, she will no longer be forced to go to the open defecation and will not hear her husband's constant taunts and sarcasm
 iske baad usne apane vakil ke jariye apane pati ko yah khabar bhijwa di ki ab vah shaadi or jari nahin rakh sakati, kyonki uske ghar main shauchalay nahin he or jise ghar main banavaane ke liye uskaa pati bhi taiyaar nahin he
 If we look at the problem of lack of toilets in India, especially in villages, then it will be revealed that open defecation is a truth for millions of people in rural areas and especially women have to face a lot of taunts due to lack of toilets in their home
 , Because they defecate in the open, that too mostly in the dark
 sunita ke pati kaa bhi maananaa he ki ghar main shauchalay nahin hone kii vajah se donon ke rishton main daraar ai, lekin uskaa yah bhi maananaa he ki uske paas shauchalay banavaane ke liye paise nahin the
 If we look at the problem of toilet in the village, according to recently received data-comments -bihar ke 82 fisadi gramin gharon main shauchalay nahin he - Under the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan, a 15-year-old government scheme, every household in the country should get around Rs 10,000 for making toilet
 -centre sarkaar is yojana par nae sire se bal de rahi he
 But the difficulty is that in most cases this money is neither complete, nor any account is kept of it and in many cases this money does not reach home
 vidambnaa yah he ki saal 2011 main, pahadpur-bisanpur naamak panchayat ko centre sarkaar ne nirmal gram ghoshit kiya tha, yah bataate hue ki yah jagah khule main shouch se mukt he
 There is no one to answer how such an announcement was made
 jab bhi vah khule main shouch ke liye jaati, use apane pati ke lagaataar taane or fabtiyaan sunani padatin
 Ultimately, Sunita decides that enough is enough, she will no longer be forced to go to the open defecation and will not hear her husband's constant taunts and sarcasm
 iske baad usne apane vakil ke jariye apane pati ko yah khabar bhijwa di ki ab vah shaadi or jari nahin rakh sakati, kyonki uske ghar main shauchalay nahin he or jise ghar main banavaane ke liye uskaa pati bhi taiyaar nahin he

 But the difficulty is that in most cases this money is neither complete, nor any account is kept of it and in many cases this money does not reach home

 lekin mushkil ye he ki zyaadaatar maamalon main ye paisa na to puraa padataa he, na hi iskaa koi hisaab-kitaab rakhaa jaataa he or kai maamalon main to yah paisa ghar tak pahunchataa hi nahin

 It was last year, when Roger Federer lost to Wilfred Tsonga in the quarter-final match at the tennis court of his favorite All England Club (more famously known as Wimbledon)
 
 
 aisa pehali baar hua tha ki federer kisi grand slam mukaable main pehle do set jeetne ke baad bhi match nahin jeet paae
 
 
 However, this was not only visible in Wimbledon, but also in other Grand Slam tournaments
 
 
 duniya main sabase zyaada grand slam khitaab jeet chuke federer beete dhai saal se grand slam khitaab ke liye taras rahe the
 
 
 He was unable to advance to number 3 in front of Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal
 
 
 mujhe bhi lag rahaa tha, koi kitna bhi bada sitara kyon na ho, ek din aisa aata he, jab uske din ladane lagate hai
 
 
 And, not only me, many people like me started thinking
 
 
 lekin shaayad federer kisi duusari mitti ke bane hue hai
 
 
 He said last time, i will come back once more
 
 
 or uske baavjood jab is saal bhi vah wimbledon pahunche to kisi ko andaaza nahin tha ki vah sabko jhuthla denge
 
 
 Nadal's unexpected defeat had lessened his difficulty, but the doubt remained
 
 
 phir semifinal main unki takkar novak jokovich jaise tejatarraar khilaadi se hui, or unhone jis sahaj andaaj main use haraaya, usase laga ki form aati-jaati rahati he, class hameshaa bana rahata he
 
 
 And after Djokovic, Federer was not even kind to Andy Murray, and created history
 
 
 final ke baad federer or mare, donon kii ankhon main aansu the
 
 
 But Federer's tears were not of victory
 
 
 vah darasal, us bharose kaa chhalakna tha, jiske boote vah dhai saal se har grand slam khilne pahunch rahe the
 
 
 Despite all the criticisms, neither did his trust waver, nor did his commitment fall short
 
 
 duusari taraf, mare ke gam-chhalakaate aansuon main bhi kahin na kahin apane jeniyas saathi ke bharose kaa sammaan chipa hoga hi
 
 
 Federer won Wimbledon's men's singles title for the seventh time
 
 
 peet sampraas unke adarsh rahe hai, or ab wimbledon khitaab jeetne ke maamle main federer unki barabari par pahunch gaye hai
 
 
 Not only this, this success has made him once again the number one player in the world
 
 
 286 saptaah tak (lagaataar nahin) number van khilaadi rahane ke sampraas ke ek ore record kii barabari bhi unhone kar lee he
 
 
 However, now the number of his Grand Slam titles has increased to 17, which is a World Record, and so many titles will be won by another, this is unlikely to happen in the near future
 
 
 tennis ke prati federer kaa samarpan or patibaddhta dekhne laayak hoti he
 
 
 His discipline towards sports further enhances his stature
 
 
 vah kisi sangeetkaar kii tarah tennis kii ek khaas dhun viksit kar chuke hai
 
 
 Today, as the modern tennis court is becoming the arena of the power game, his game still has a special edge, whether it is stormy service or a hand-held back-hand return
 
 
 yahi vajah he ki federer agar haar bhi rahe hon to unka khel mantrmugdh kar detaa he
 
 
 His mistakes also seem more perfect than the winner shots of others
 
 
 yahi vajah he ki 30 saal kii umr bitne ke baad bhi vah yuvaaon ke mukaable puure damakham ke saath maidan main maujuud hai
 
 
 Staying on top for a decade today is no laughing matter
 
 
 tippaniyan You can also compare him with Sachin Tendulkar, for whom there is nothing left to gain
 
 
 lekin khel ke prati pishan main koi kami nahin ai
 
 
 Although Sachin is in a more comfortable position than Federer, because the tennis team is not a game and it takes a lot of courage, but Federer is also fit and he has the ability to play a year or two
 
 
 
 federer ke ab tak ke safar par agar gaur se nazar daalen to pataa chalata he ki unka andaaj bahut dostana he
 
 
 Wherever he goes, he makes friends
 
 
 itihaas or record se unki dosti to gadhi he hi
 
 
 This gives hope that Federer's name is still a few more pages in the history and records of tennis
 
 
 lekin behatar yahi hoga ki federer sheersh par rahete hue khel ko alavida kah den, kyonki yuva khilaadiyon kii fouj tennis ke is sabase bade jeniyas ko kinare kar de, isse behatar yahi hoga ki vah khud hi unke liye jagah khaali kar den
 
 
 But maybe Federer is made of some other clay
 
 
 unhone pichhali baar kaha tha, main ek baar phir waapas aauungaa
 
 
 And despite this, when he arrived at Wimbledon this year, no one had any idea that he would defy everyone
 
 
 nadal kii apratyaashit haar ne unki mushkil kam zarur kar di thi, parantu sanshay barkaraar tha
 
 
 Then in the semi-finals, he was confronted by a fiery player like Novak Djokovic, and the simple way in which he defeated him felt that form kept on coming and going, class always
 
 
 or phir jokovich ke baad endi mare par bhi federer ne raham nahin kiya, or itihaas rach daalaa
 
 
 Federer and Murray both had tears in their eyes after the final
 
 
 lekin federer ke aansu jeet ke nahin the
 
 
 He was, in fact, a spill of that trust, due to which he was going to play every Grand Slam for two and a half years
 
 
 tamaam aalochanaon ke baad bhi na unka bharosa dagamagaaya tha, na unki patibaddhta main koi kami ai thi
 
 
 On the other hand, somewhere in the sorrow and tears of Murray, there will be some respect for the trust of his genius partner
 
 
 federer wimbledon kaa purush ekal khitaab saatvin baar jite hai
 
 
 Pete Sampras has been his role model, and now Federer is on par with him in terms of winning the Wimbledon title
 
 
 itnaa hi nahin, is kamyaabi ne unhen ek baar phir duniya kaa number van khilaadi bana diya he
 
 
 He has also equaled the record on one side of Sampras being the number one player for 286 weeks (not continuously)
 
 
 vaise ab unke grand slam khitaabon kii sankhya 17 ho chuki he, jo ek vishwarecord he, or itane khitaab koi doosraa jeet paaegaa, yah nikat bhavishya main sambhav nahin dikhataa
 
 
 Federer's dedication and commitment to tennis is worth watching
 
 
 khel ke prati unka anushaasan unke kad ko or badha detaa he
 
 
 He has developed a special tune of tennis like a musician
 
 
 aaj, jab aadhunik tennis court power game kaa akhaada banataa ja rahaa he, unke khel main aaj bhi khaas nafaasat dekhne ko milti he, bhale hi vah tufaani sarvice ho yaa ek haath se sadha hua back-hand ritern
 
 
 This is the reason why Federer is mesmerized even if he is losing
 
 
 unki galtiyaan bhi dusron ke vinar shot se zyaada parfect lagati hai
 
 
 This is the reason why even after the age of 30 years, he is present in the field with full power compared to the youth
 
 
 aaj ke daur main ek dashak tak sheersh par bane rahanaa koi hansi-khel nahin he
 
 
 The comments aap unki tulana sachin tendulkar se bhi kar sakate hai, jinke liye hasil karne ko kuch bhi baaki nahin
 
 
 But there was no decrease in passion for the game
 
 
 haalanki federer ke mukaable sachin kuch zyaada aaraamdeh sthiti main hai, kyonki tennis team game nahin he or isamen dam-kham bhi kuch zyaada lagata he, lekin federer feet bhi hai or ek-do saal khelte rahane kaa dam-kham bhi unamem abhi maujuud he
 
 
 If you look closely at Federer's journey so far, then he shows that his style is very friendly
 
 
 vah jahaan bhi jate hai, dost bana lete hai
 
 
 His friendship with history and records is strong
 
 
 isse ummid bandhati he ki tennis ke itihaas or record main federer ke naam abhi kuch or panne baaki hai
 
 
 But it would be better for Federer to leave the game at the top, because an army of young players can sidestep the biggest genius of tennis, it would be better to free up space for himself

 Here are excerpts from that conversation: So you have prepared to come to Delhi? No, i will not answer any hypothetical question
 gujarat main kya karnaa he, is par to aapke khyal bilkul saaf hai
 What do you think is the most important thing in India that has to be rectified? India currently lacks leaders, policy and intentions
 to kya aap vah ‘netaa’ nahin honge? adhiktar janamat surveykshan aapako pradhanmantri pad kaa sabase yogya ummidavaar bataa rahe hai?meraa dhyaan gujarat par he
 My commitment is currently to 60 million Gujaratis
 meraa asli sapana gujarat ke vikaas suchakank ko duniya ke sarvaadhik viksit deshon ke bhi paar le janaa he or main yah kar saktaa hum
 There are many possibilities
 masalan, gujarat ke samudri kinare par 52 dweep hai
 i want to make them an international level tourist destination
 main hameshaa hatakar sochataa hum or ek baat yaad rakhieh nehru parivaar aitihaasik rup se gujarati netaaon ko pasand nahin karata
 He misbehaved with Patel
 morarji desai ko unhone nahin choda
 Now it's my turn to be the target
 aapaki chhavi ek aadhunik netaa kii he, korporate jagat kaa aapako samarthan he
 Nevertheless, you are opposed to foreign investment in retail? It is a state subject and imposing it is playing with the federal structure of the country
 isse bhi badi baat yah he ki krishi ke baad is desh main rojgaron kaa sabase bada madhyam choti dukaane hai
 FDI will end this
 yah hamaari menuphaccharing kii kshamta par bhi asar daalega
 FDI will not help the economy of India
 yahaan tak ki raashtrapati obama bhi nahin chaahate ki america rojgaar vahaan se baahar jaaen
 i saw his tweet on this
 maine to sochaa ki aapke adarsh misses thatcher yaa reagan honge?obama is maamle main sahi hai
 Anyway, FDI in retail is not good for the economy of India
 aisa lagata nahin ki aap musalamaanon kaa bharosa waapas jeet paae hai?main vot bank kii raajnneeti main vishwaas nahin karata
 For me there is no such thing as Hindu vote bank, Muslim vote bank or minority vote bank
 meraa parivaar chah karod gujaratiyon kaa he
 The votes cast for the BJP will obviously belong to me, but those who vote against me are also part of my family
 aap aise netaa jaan padate hai jise votaron ke bich sneh se zyada prashansa hasil he
 Some people even told me that you hide your feelings
 logon se mujhe aisi raay nahin milti
 There are many levels of emotions
 aapako raily dekhakar nahin laga ki ve mujhe sneh dete hai? ve mujhe itnaa chaahate hai ki unki bhaawanaaon kaa khyal rakhana meri jimmedaari banati he
 i see it as a challenge for myself
 aapaki aakraamak chhavi bhi he?dharna or sachai main fark hota he
 There are some very aggressive people who have created an aggressive image of Modi
 kya aap akele rahanaa pasand karte hai?main hameshaa janata ke saath rahata hum
 i have no time to be alone
 solah saal kii avasthaa main hi maine khud ko raashtra ke prati samarpit kar diya tha
 Maybe you are alone within your party? Whatever i am today, i am because of BJP and its central leadership

 The first round of voting for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections will be held on 11 February and the notification for this phase will be issued on 17 January
 samaajawaadee party ke liye ye taarikh is baar khaastaur par ahm he kyonki agar party apane ghar ke ghamaasan ko kisi anjaam tak pahunchane main naakaam rahi to is taarikh ke baad uske paas samjhaute kii gunjaaish khatm ho jaaegi or uske donon dhadon ko nai party or nae naam ke saath maidan main utarana hoga
 Significantly, the Samajwadi Party has split between Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and its national president Mulayam Singh Yadav in two factions
 donon hi kheme party or uske chunaav chinh par kabje kii ladaai chunaav ayog main lard rahe hai
 Whoever will be victorious in this battle will be considered as the Samajwadi Party and the government, but it is possible that both the parties should stay away from victory for the moment and neither save the name of the party nor the election symbol of the bicycle
 pichley dinon khud purv mukhya chunaav ayukta esavai kuraishi ne ajtak se vishesh baatcheet main saaf kar diya tha ki chunaav chinh or party ke naam par sapa ke donon dhade jis tarah daawa kar rahe hai, chunaav ayog isapar apana koi antim faisla lene main kuch maheene laga saktaa he
 In such a situation, it is possible that no faction gets the election symbol of the party
 kuraishi kii is baat se saaf he ki chunaav ke is ain maukey par party ke donon dhadon ke paas bahut simit vikalp hai
 First option - Akhilesh and Mulayam unite
 chunaav ayog main kiye gaye apane daawey donon paksh waapas len or sapa ke binar tale cycle ke chunaav chinh par ekajute hokar chunaav maidan main utren
 Another option - either Akhilesh and Mulayam leave their claim on SP and bicycle
 apni alag party banaakar apni takat kaa ahsaas karaae taaki party or uske simbel ko koi nuksaan na pahunche
 Third option - both Akhilesh and Mulayam Singh keep claiming the cycle
 chunaav ayog is chinh ko fries kar de
 Both groups fight elections with a new mark and the changed name of the party (sp-akhilesh and sp-mulayam) and make them realize their power
 sapa ke ghamaasan kaa abhi tak jo surat-e-haal he use dekhte hue philhal pehle or duusare vikalp kii sambhaavna kam hi dikhti he
 In such a situation, it is more likely that cycle symbol is not seen in these elections and instead of Samajwadi Party, two new parties like SP-A and SP-M will appear in the election field

 ' mukhyamantri ne kaha ki punjab ke shahari ilaakon main congress kaa pradarshan acha nahin rahaa or siddhu shahari vikaas mantri hai
 He said that Sidhu made a mistake by making controversial statements
 ek mantri ke taur vah is baat ko nahin samaj paae ki dharmik granthon kii brudabi ke mudde kii jaanch ke liye vishesh jaanch dal (esaiti) kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 The Chief Minister said, "yari and Jhappi from Sidhu's Army Chief of Pakistan will not be tolerated and especially the army will not tolerate it which is being targeted by pro-isi terrorists
 'iske baad mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh (captain Amrinder Singh) ne kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav parinaamon ke sandarbh main rajya sarkaar ke mantriyon ke pradarshan kii samiksha kii jaaegi

 Now arhar is also being grown in the mountains and all this has been largely due to the changing season of the mountains as well as new seeds of arhar

 -1' naamak is beej ko bhartiya krishi anusandhan parishad ke almoda sthit vivekanand parvatiy krishi anusandhan santhaan ke vaigyanikon ne taiyaar kiya he
 Its average production per hectare in Chamoli has reached 1,878 kg
 arhar kii yah prajati apni utpaadan kshamta or kam laagat ke kaaran pahaad ke doordaraj ilaakon main bhi kisaanon kii jabaan par he
 The results are visible in the form of increased production in the fields
 in dinon pile-laal phulon or rangeen faliyon se bhare arhar ke paudhe uttarakhand main kisaanon ke chehron kii raunak badha rahe hai
 Arhar is one of the oldest crops in India and is considered to be of Indian origin, but due to non-availability of seeds compatible with mountain conditions, turf has never been traditionally cultivated in the mountainous regions
 haalat yah thi ki 2007 se pehle kumaun ke sabhi jilo main kul milakar 19 hectare se bhi kam ilaake main isaki paidaavaar hoti thi
 Even after almost a full year, the production per hectare was only around 789 kg
 rajya sarkaar ke aankadon par gaur karen to is saal akavle almoda main hi arhar kii buaai 407 hectare main fail gai he or ausat utpaadan 1,280 kilogram prati hectayar ho gaya he
 Due to this seed in Kumaon, now income has started increasing from the fields which remain barren of the farmers
 arhar pehle kam maatra main ek varshiya fasal ke rup main taiyaar hoti thi
 It used to take seven to ten months between its sowing and ripening
 vivekanand parvatiy krishi anusandhan santhaan ke nideshak dow
 Says Jagdish Chadra Bhatt, "the first available arhar species was not compatible with the cropping cycle of the mountainous region
 lambii avadhi kii hone ke kaaran yah rabi kii fasal ke saath nahin ugaai ja sakati thi
 In winter there was a problem of ripening of seeds from their beans
 lekin yah nayaa beej 130 se 140 dinon ke bich pakakar taiyaar ho jaataa he or isaki sabase badi khaasiyat yah he ki yah har prakaar kii bhoomi main paidaa ho jaataa he
 "not only this, diseases are less in this species of pigeonpea and its yield is good even in less water
 yah poshan ke maamle main bhi duusari prajatiyon se behatar he
 The protein content in this is 22 percent

 Now they are getting good results too

 She says, "seed consumption also decreased in sowing and germination was also good
 paudhe lambey or mote ho rahe hai or in par 100 se zyada faliyaan hai
 The biggest thing is that it also takes less effort

 Production is also 18 to 20 quintals per hectare
 prayogshaala ke saath-saath kheton main bhi is beej ke achche nattejey rahe hai
 Last year, 20 villages in Almora, Bageshwar and Nainital districts have produced 1,280 kg of arhar per hectare based on these seeds

 At the time of elections, the leaders unite to reach the heart of the voters
 uttar pradesh chunaav main jameen par chunaav ayog kii sakhti dekhakar netaaon ne aasmaan ke jariye votaron ke dil tak pahunchane kii koshish kii or iskaa tarika bhi dhund nikaala
 But before the leaders could fly in the air, the Election Commission cut their doors
 netaaon kaa bas chale to shahar-gaanv kii tamaam sadakon ko poster binar se paat den
 But the days of showing strength through posters and banners were over
 chunaav ayog ki sakhti ab aisi he ki nae binar poster kya lagenge puraane bhi hataa die gaye hai
 Till a few days ago, there were so many posters of leaders at every intersection in the cities of Uttar Pradesh that it is difficult to count
 lekin chunaav ghoshit hote hi sab ke sab hataa die gaye
 Then the leaders thought of a solution
 makar sankranti ke samay puure uttar bharat main patang udaane kii parampara he
 The leaders wondered why this excuse should not be passed on the heads of voters
 netaaon ne apane samarthakon ko ishaara kar diya or dekhte hi dekhte patang kii dukaane modi, mulaayam singh or akhilesh yadav ke patangon se pat gai
 But before the leaders were flying in the air riding on kites, the Election Commission got a clue
 chanaav ayog ne saaf kar diya ki patangon kii shakl main netaaon ke poster aasmaan main nahin laharaa sakate
 It was said that this election will be a violation of the code of conduct and action will be taken against the shopkeeper who is found selling such kites
 uttar pradesh ke farrukhabad main tamaam dukaanon par aisi patangon kii bharmaar lag chuki thi
 Somewhere along with kites, the surgical strike was being glorified with Modi's photo, while Akhilesh Yadav was smiling with his expressway
 bikri bhi thik-thaak ho rahi thi lekin tabhi chunaav ayog ke aadesh par chapa markar tamaam tamaam dukaanon se aisi bahut sari patangen jabt kii gayi
 Now all such kites are lying in the junk

 In Uttar Pradesh itself, in the last assembly election, on the order of the Election Commission, all the stone elephants made by Mayawati were covered
 hathi bahujan samaaj party kaa chunaav nishaan he
 But the funniest example of the Election Commission's decree was seen in the 2013 Chhattisgarh assembly elections
 tab congress kii shikaayat par chunaav ayog ne ye aadesh de diya tha ki sadakon ke kinare jitne taal-tilaiya main camel ke phool khile hai sab ko dhak diya jaae kyonki yah bijepi kaa chinh he
 According to a kite seller, the most sought after kites bearing Modi's picture was so far

 It was later extended to 2010
 bharat ab 5veen janareshan ke fiter plane ke nirmaan ko lekar taiyaari main he

 supreme court ne tripal talaak ko khatm kar diya he
 There are many questions in the Muslim society regarding the court's decision
 quran hadeesh kii roshni main court kaa faisla kahaan tak jaij he
 What effect will this have on Muslim society? ab agar koi shaks apni patni ko tripal talaak detaa he to aisi sthiti main uske liye kya raste honge
 Aajtak to Professor Junaid Haris, Islamic Studies of Jamia Millia Islamia University for the answers to all such questions
 in ne baat kii
 Judgment professor in favor of Islam, Junaid Haris says - The Supreme Court has abolished the One Seating Tripral Divorce is not a new job, but Islam has banned it 1400 years ago
 aise main court kaa faisla islam ke haq main he
 One Sitting Triple Divorce is haraam to everyone including Quran, Hadish
 iske baavjood musalamaanon main hanfi masalak (vichaardhaara) ke log asweekaarya maanate hue bhi unka mat he ki agar kisi ne van seating tripal talaak de diya he to galat kiya, par talaak ho jayega
 Muslims do not have the provision to punish, says Junaid Haris - Hanafi Maslak also allows the person to give triple talaq
 lekinbharat main musalamanonke paas dand dene kaa koi sanvaidhanik praavdhaan nahin he
 The court has the right to punish only
 aise main mai samajhataa hum ki court or sarkaar hanfi masalak ke viddhanon ke saath baithkar dand kaa praavdhaan nirdhaarit kar use lagu karti
 Influence will read on Hanafi Muslak Junaid says that the impact of Supreme Court decision will be read on Hanafi Musalak
 darasal hindustan main hanfi vichaardhaara ke maanane vaale logi kii badi aabaadi he
 There are more triple divorce cases in this ideology
 court kaa faisla un musalamaanon ke liye hai zyada mahatv rakhata he, jo apane maamle ko court ke jariye hal karaate hai
 On the other hand, this decision is not important for those who solve their cases under Muslim Personal Law
 jaagarukta abhiyaan chalaanaa hogounkaa kaha he ki duniya ke tamaam deshon main tripal talaak bain he
 Despite this, triple divorces are still happening there
 chaahe pakistan kaa maamla ho yaa phir bangladesh kaa
 In such a situation, the court has abolished it in India, but it will be reduced only when an awareness campaign is conducted among the Muslims
 ham ummid karte hai ki iskaa raajnneetik karan nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Otherwise, the fate of this will be the same as the rest of the things have been banned by the court, but it has fallen away due to political reasons
 ab talaak ke maamle court main zyada badhegenhaaris kehete hai ki supreme court ke faisle ko baad ab agar kisi muslim mahila ko koi tripal talaak detaa he, to ab us mahila ke upar nirbhar karegaa ki vah court jaati he yaa phir sharai lihaaj se apane masale ko hal karti he
 This option was also there earlier
 lekin ab talaak ke maamle court main zyada jaayenge
 The women who fought what they got called Junaid Haris - The victims who have fought the entire battle against one-sitting Triple Divorce, now let's see what the government does for them
 unka talaak hue lanbaa samay ho chukaa he
 In such a situation, some of them have married marriages, some will have died
 itnaa hi nahin court main jane se unke bich dushmani kii khai or gahari ho chuki hai
 In such a situation, the government took steps for his revival

 jafar ikbaal ne kaha, ‘ham sab yahaan isliye jute he
 That Dadda (dhyanchand) should be respected
 lekin ham sirf ummid kar sakate hai ki unhen yah mili
 Political will matters
 jab sachin tendulkar ko yah sammaan (2014 main) mila tab bhi aisa hi tha
 Whether he gets the award or not, it will not affect his status
 lekin unhen yah milanaa chahie kyonki vah iske sabase adhik hakdaar hai
 Ajit Pal, who captained the team during India's title win in the World Cup 1975, said that Dhyanchand should have been the first player to receive this honor
 ajit paal ne kaha, ‘duniya bhar ke log unhen jaanate hai
 He is known as a hockey wizard and we have heard so many stories about him

 He should have been the first player to achieve this

 vah ise hasil karne vaale pehle khilaadi hone chahie the
 He played and won the gold medal when India traveled in bullock carts, in extreme poverty

 The previous governments made a mistake by not awarding them
 ummid karata hum ki ye sarkaar is galati ko sudhaaregi

 Dhyanchand played when we were under Britain
 aaj kal medal jeetne par jo inaam miltaa he vah tab nahin miltaa tha
 Dhyanchand's son Ashok Kumar said, "he is a father figure to us in hockey

 First Justice AK Sikri read his decision
 maamle main faisla padhate hue justise sikri ne kaha ki rajdhani main sabhi akjicutive adhikaar dilli sarkaar ke paas hi rahenge
 Justice Ashok Bhushan also agreed with Justice Sikri on some issues, but the two judges differed on the issue of transfer-posting, so the issue has been referred to a larger bench
 haalanki, dilli main jameen, police or kanoon vyavastha se jude sabhi adhikaar centre sarkaar yani uparajyapal ke paas hi rahenge
 However, this is not yet a final decision as there appears to be differences in the two judges' benches
 gauratlab he ki dilli sarkaar banaam uparajyapal kaa maamla dilli main kejariwal sarkaar ne uthaaya to maamla hai court main gaya
 The High Court, in its judgment, described the Lieutenant Governor as the boss of Delhi
 dilli hai court ne 4 agast 2016 ko is masale par sunwaayee karte hue kaha tha ki uparajyapal hi dilli ke prashasnic pramukh hai or dilli sarkaar uparajyapal kii marji ke bina kanoon nahin bana sakati
 According to the High Court's decision, the Lieutenant Governor is not bound to accept the Delhi Government's decision and he can take the decision on the basis of his discretion, along with obtaining permission of LG before issuing any kind of notification to the Delhi Government

 Seven years passed after this incident which shook the whole country, but the accused who have been hanged from the lower court to the Supreme Court, have not been sentenced till now
 ek taraf nirbhaya ke doshiyon ko mili faansee kii sajaa taamil karaane kii maang jor pakad rahi he, vahiin duusari taraf asia kii sabase badi jelon main shumaaratihaadke paas jallaad nahin he
 In such a situation, questions have also arisen as to how the culprits will be punished for hanging
 is sambandh main jail prashasan kaa kahana he ki jab bhi kisi doshi ko faansee kii sajaa deni hoti he, tab un jelon se sampark kiya jaataa he jinke paas apane jallaad hai
 The executioners will be brought for one day According to the administration, the executioner is brought to Tihar for one day
 doshi ko faansee dene ke baad jallaad apni tainaati vaali jail main laut jate hai
 It is worth mentioning that the family is circling the court to serve the death sentence of the convicts of Niribhaya
 hyderabad kii ghatana ke baad upje janaakrosh ke bich mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne bhi aropiyon ko jald sajaa die jane kii maang kar di he

 siem kejariwal ne bhi spasht kiya ki dilli sarkaar aise jaghanya aparaadh ko anjaam dene vaale doshi kii faansee kii sajaa maaf karne ke paksh main nahin he
 Kejriwal advocated severe punishment for the culprits and said that the Delhi government is not in favor of softening the rapists
 raashtrapati ke paas bheji jaaegi dayaa yachikadilli sarkaar kii ore se 'maafee nahin' likhakar uparajyapal ko bheji gai dayaa yachika ab diarector dilli ke paas gai he
 He will send it to the Home Department of the Government of India
 aakhir main dayaa yachika raashtrapati ke paas bheji jaaegi
 If the President rejects the petition, then the jail administration will go to court and issue a death warrant, also called a black warrant, from the court
 court se deth warrant jari hone ke baad doshiyon ko faansee par latakaae jane kaa rasta saaf ho jayega
 Let me tell that only one of the four convicts sentenced to death has filed a mercy petition

 police ko rakabar par hamale kii jaankaree 12 bajkar 40 minute par mili thi, lekin police usko ilaaj ke liye 3 baje aspataal lekar pahunchati he
 In such a situation the question arises that 2 to 2
 30 ghante tak rakabar kahaan tha
 12 according to the police
 40 par soochna milte hi vah maukey par pahunch gai thi
 Navalkishore Sharma, who gave information to the police and boarded the vehicle with the police, said that at one o'clock in the night the police took the injured to Ramgarh police station
 lekin rakabar kaa ilaaj karne vaale doctoron kaa kahana he police use subah 3 baje aspataal lekar ai thi
 In such a situation, the police are questioning where Akbar was for two hours
 rakabar khan kii maut police kii pitayee se bhi hone ke maamle main alvar ke espi rajendra singh ne bayaan diya he
 He said that the matter is being investigated, if the policemen are found guilty, they will be punished
 thane main rakabar ke saath hui marpethpulice ko sabase pehle ghatana kii soochna dene vaale navalkishor sharma ne bataaya ki police ne ghayalarakabarake ilaaj main na keval dhai se teen ghante kii deree kii, balki use ramgarh thane le jaakar usase marpet bhi kii gai
 He died there
 gauratlab he ki khud police ne exiaar main sharma ko ghatana kii sabase pehle soochna dene vaala or maukey par saath le jane vaala bataaya he
 This sensational revelation of Sharma has given a new twist to the whole affair
 unhone bataaya ki jab raat ko ghayal rakabar ko thane par lekar aae the tab unako gambhir chot nahin thi or agar chot thi to police ne aspataal main bhartee kyon nahin karavaaya
 The police took Rakbar to the hospital at 3 pm, but by then he had died
 navalkishor sharma ne bataaya ki police ko unhone kareeb 12
 Notice was given at 40
 iske kareeb das minute baad hi ve khud police thane pahunche
 From where the police team accompanied him in a government vehicle and reached the spot
 yahaan rakabar keechad main sanaa padaa tha
 He did not have any serious injuries that would lead to his death
 isliye police maukey se uthaakar use sidhe ramgarh police thane le gai
 Rakbar, soaked in mud, was bathed here and as his clothes got wet, the police sent Lalwandi resident Dharmendra Yadav to ask for clothes and those clothes were put on him
 is dauraan thane main uske saath marpet kii gai
 Rakbar died due to this fight
 navalkishor sharma kaa kahana he ki kareeb do se dhai ghante police ne rakabar ko thane main rakhaa
 He has died in police custody
 sutron kaa kahana he ki rakabar kii ghatnasthal par halaat maranansann nahin thi
 If this happens, the police would take him directly to the hospital
 yaa to uski haalat thik thi yaa police ne ilaaj main deree kii
 There can be only one reason for both
 police kii timming par sawalnavalkishor sharma ke daawey ke alaava ghatnakram kii timeline bhi police ko kathghare main khadaa kar rahi he
 In fact, the police, in the FIR filed by ASI Mohan Singh, himself said that he was about 12 at night
 40 baje soochna mili
 The big question in such a situation is that if the police walked with the injured Akbar at one o'clock, how did it take 3 hours to reach the hospital just 4 km away
 aspataal main rakabar kaa ilaaj karne vaale doctor ke mutabik police use subah kareeb 3 baje aspataal lekar pahunchi
 That is, there was a delay of about three hours in treatment
 ramgarh ke saamudayik swasthya centre ke doctor hasan ali ne kaha ki police 3 baje agyaat vyakti ko lekar ai thi jo mrit avasthaa me tha
 He said that this incident happened at one o'clock, so where was this person till 3 o'clock
 shaayad samay par aspataal main bhartee karaayaa jaataa to shaayad use bachaaya ja saktaa tha
 Police was absent from the show that lasted for an hour
 der se pahunchi police jab bachche ko bheed se chhudaakar le jane lagi to police se gussaye bheed ne ek baar phir se bachche ko khambhe main baandhakar pitayee kar di
 Despite the beating, when the mobile was not found, the people left the child
 is puure ghatana ke baavjood police anjaan bani rahi or kuch bhi kehane se bachati rahi
 When the anger of the people subsided, the police took the child to the hospital for treatment
 dakshin−dilli ke posh ilaake vasant kunj main ek 20 saal kii yuvati ke saath gangrape kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 It is being told that the girl was found at around 12 on Tuesday night near Priya Cinema
 30 baje do yuvakon ne kidanap kiya or use rangapuri pahari ilaake ke makaan main le gaye
 Where the third partner of both the youths was also present
 pehle yuvati ko peeta gaya or phir uske saath teenon yuvakon ne balaatkaar kiya
 The woman was then released near the gurdwara at Vasant Vihar
 peedit yuvati ne pisiar ko phone kiya or police ke paas shikaayat darj karwaai
 The police van rushed to the spot and the victim was taken to a nearby hospital where the rape was confirmed after investigation
 police yuvati ko lekar rangapuri pahari gai, jahaan se teenon aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 The three accused were produced before the court on Wednesday
 court ne teenon ko 20 march tak nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya he
 Two of the three accused work in a private company and one is studying in IGNOU
 peedit yuvati ek baar main kaam karti he
 The victim called the PCR and lodged a complaint with the police
 police kii vine maukey par pahunchi or peedit yuvati ko paas ke aspataal le jaaya gaya jahaan jaanch ke baad rape kii pushti kar di gai
 Police went to Rangpuri hill with the girl from where the three accused were arrested
 teenon aropiyon ko buudhvaar ko court ke saamne pesh kiya gaya
 The court has sent the three to judicial custody till 20 March
 teenon aropiyon main se do privet company main kaam karte hai or ek ignu main padhai kar rahaa he
 The victimized girl works at once
 pradhanmantri narendra modi bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kaa nirvivaad chunavi cheharaa hai or 25 july se 1 sitambar ke bich ve bihar main chaar reliyon ko sambodhit kar chuke the
 If a government event is also organized in Ara on August 18, a fifth rally is held
 aara main pradhanmantri ne rajya ke liye 1
 25 lakh crore Rs
 ke vishesh package kii ghoshnaa ke saath apni dariyaadilii kaa izhaar kiya or centre tathaa desh ke sabase pichde rajyon main ek bihar ke saath sahaj naata jodgaye kii rajnatik sambhaavnaaon ko talasha
 But suddenly after September 1, Modi stayed away from Bihar for almost a month
 phir, ve 2 aktubar ko dakshin-purvi bihar ke baankaa main namoodaar hue
 The dates for the biggest political clash of 2015 were set
 so, modi ne fouran apane purv sahyogi magar ab dhur virdohi nitish kumaar par nishaanaa saadhaa
 In that he used very sharp speech and jumlebaazi, for which he is famous
 unhone nitish par apane ahankaar ko rajya ke hiton se upar rakhane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Perhaps the Prime Minister has developed this style in the era of Gujarat's politics, he has reached later as a leader who emphasizes on development and progress
 in chaar-paanch hakraton main kaaphi kuch badal gaya he
 The battle of Bihar has been considered a close contest, although the BJP and its allies have been seen to gain in the aftermath of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and subsequent political developments
 lekin yah badhat lagaataar ghatati gai he
 The reason could be anything, whether there is a split in the NDA over tickets or a round of public outcry of allies or a damaging comment on the reservation of the RSS chief
 aisa lagata he ki bijepi ko apni jamini pakad banaae rakhane ke liye nai ranneeti kii jarurat he
 That is why Modi is starting a series of stormy tours in the state and is promising to change Bihar when the NDA government comes to power by attacking Nitish and his aide Lalu Prasad Yadav
 india today group-sisero ke duusare janamat surveykshan main jameen par logon ke lagaataar badalte mood kaa hi izhaar hua he
 The Janata Dal (united) and Rashtriya Janata dal-congress Mahagathbandhan, which fell marginally ahead of the NDA in both the estimated vote share and the number of seats in the first poll in September, took the lead in the second survey held in October
 is surveykshan kaa anumaan he ki use 243 sadasyeey vidhansabha main 1 seat se bahumat hasil ho saktaa he (dekhen surveykshan chart)
 Opinion polls show that BJP is lagging behind JD (U) among rural and urban voters, caste groups and youth
 bijepi ne apane paramparik votaron yani savarnon main apni lokapriyata ko barkaraar rakhaa he jabaki vah jedy (you) ke kile (pichad jati, mahadalit or musalmaan) main send nahin laga saki he
 The JD (U) has retained its hold in caste-related supporters but its popularity among younger voters has declined marginally but even here it is ahead of the BJP
 shahari votaron main bijepi kii lokapriyata ghati he jabaki jedy (you) kii badi he
 The game does not seem to go in anyone's favor, and will matter until the last vote
 isamen koi shubahaa nahin ki donon paksh bihar jeetne ke liye apana sab kuch jhonke hue hai
 In this way, this is a general assembly election in the main Hindi state
 isse centre kii satta main baithi party ke rajnatik bhavishya par koi mahatvapurn asar nahin padane vaala he, na hi use centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ke 16 maheenon ke kaamkaaj par raishumaari mana jayega
 The Opposition may say so because if you see BJP President Amit Shah inviting all his forces and Modi spends so much energy and time, then there is a completely different feeling
 shah ke liye bihar kaa maidan yah sabit karne kaa makul mauka he ki dilli vidhansabha kii haar to haadasa maatr thi
 This can also prove that he is an unmatched strategist and his second term of party president may easily be stamped in december-january
 modi ke liye bihar kii jeet na sirf yah bataane keliye kaaphi hogi ki 2014 kii modi lahar badastoor kaayam he, isse yah bhi sabit hoga ki centre or rajyon main unki style kaa vikaas or raajnneeti jaij he
 This will also make it easier for them to pursue their policies at the Center
 daanv is kadar ooncha he ki modi nitish ke bainks kisi sthaneey chehre ke badale sidhe khud ko khadaa karne main katai nahin hichake or in chunaav main aise muddon kii bharmaar ho gai jinka rajya se koi vaasta nahin he
 For example, Modi's foreign visits, Hardik Patel's reservation campaign in Gujarat and his support to Nitish etc
 daanv nitish or lalu ke liye bhi lagbhag utane hi oonche hai
 The 2015 elections in Bihar are not just a battle to gain power in Patna, but also a struggle for their political existence and relevance
 1980 or 1990 ke shuruaati dashak main lalu ke chanakya kahe jane vaale nitish khud ubharkar saamne aae or 2005 se lagbhag ek dashak tak rajya ko apane hisaab se chalaate rahe
 2015 has come as a political irony for Nitish
 2013 main modi ke pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banane ke baad endie se naata todgaye ke saath sushasan or saamaajik samikarnon ko saadhane main maharath kii vajah se bihar main unki chhavi sabase kaddavar netaa kii bani hui he
 However, this strategy did not work in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 nitish buree tarah haare to lalu kii ore haath badhaane ko majaboor hue
 This same decision is to be tested in October 2015
 lalu yadav 2013 main chaara ghotaale main sajaa paane ke baad se jamaanat par hai or chunaav nahin lard sakate
 His wife Rabri Devi, too, seems to have lost interest in electoral politics, having suffered two assembly seats in 2010 and a heavy defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 phir bhi lalu is chunaav main apane parivaar ke hiton ko aage badhaane se nahin hichake
 The 2015 assembly election may be the last chance for him to hand over his legacy to two non-experienced sons Tej Pratap and Tejashwi
 itihaaskaar romila thapar pracheen bharat ke itihaas ko pracheen bihar kii katha ke rup main bataati hai
 She says that whatever achievements India has made in the field of education, administration, society or religion, all have their roots in Bihar
 yah sadiyon pehle kii baat he
 Contemporary Bihar is far behind all the major states of the country in terms of human development index or overall production or basic facilities, health, education and law and order
 bangaluru ke indian institute of management main centre for public policy ke associat professor arnab mukherjee ke mutabik, bihar ke teen charan hai
 Bihar with pre-partition economy, post-partition economy (2000–2005 phase) and post-2005 elections, when Nitish came to power with JD (U) and BJP alliance
 is tisare daur main, bakaul mukherjee, bihar main nitiyon, prashasan or aarthik pragati kemaamle main bade badlaav dikhe
 He says, "this round looked completely different from the earlier phase, both numerically and qualitatively
 bihar kaa ek ausat aadmi desh ke ausat aadmi kii tulana main 30 pratishat hi hasil kar rahaa tha
 Nitish removed this difference
 dashakon kii upeksha ke baad ausat bihari ke khate main mahatvapurn laabh dikhaa
 "partition affected Bihar's progress
 navgathit rajya jharkhand puure sansadhano kaa teen-chauthai hissaa le gaya jabaki dendariyon main usne mahaj ek-chauthai kii hi hissedari kii
 The division dealt a major blow to industries, which were accounting for up to 24 per cent of gross state domestic product (GSDP) in undivided Bihar
 vibhajit bihar main unki hissedari sirf chaar pratishat rah gai
 The economy of Bihar has become completely based on agriculture, which has always been vulnerable to drought and heavy rains
 lekin 2005 ke chunaav ke baad bihar kii arthvyavastha main achaanak oochaal aayaa
 Gross annual growth rate in Bihar between 2005 and 2010
8
 6 pratishat rahi he jabaki puure desh main yah vruddhi 7
 04 percent
 jaankaar iske liye sadaken or pulon ke vistaar kaa shrey nitish ko dete hai, haalanki is maamle main bhi bihar rashtriya ausat se abhi peeche he
 This change of Bihar is worth considering, but does Nanya state have the capacity to maintain this rate of progress? Arnab Mukherjee and Professor Anjan Mukherjee of jnu's Center for Economic Studies and Planning argue that due to lack of strong leadership, job-qualified candidates and professional training, Bihar may soon go backward
 isse lagata he ki nitish ke liye manch taiyaar he or unke saath lalu ke liye bhi
 The matter is getting lost to some extent in the statements with the slogan and the desire to sway the headlines
 pehle charan ke matdaan se pehle donon hi mukhya gathbandhan jati or bif vivaad main zyada vakt jaaya kar rahe hai
 Lalu first said, "hindus also eat beef
 ” phir nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye us “shaitanya” ko doshi tehraaya, jisane “mere munh main yah baat daal di
 This new issue brought relief for BJP leaders who are struggling to reduce the impact of the statement on the caste reservation of the RSS chief
 so, aashcharya nahin ki nitish ke lalu ke saath gathjod ko dodhari talwaar kii tarah mana ja rahaa he, jinke bihar main raaj ko virdohi “jangal rajya” kehete hai
 Lalu's Yadav caste is estimated to account for 14 percent of Bihar's population
 is gathjod se nitish ko voton ke maamle main kaaphi phayda hone kii ummid he
 But within the JD (U), it is feared that the prevailing perceptions about Lalu could also discredit Nitish's supporters among other castes
 nitish ko shaayad is khatre kaa ehsaas he
 From this, it is known that why JD (U) hoardings and posters only discuss Nitish's good governance
 koshish he ki in chunaavon ko nitish ke sushasan par raishumaari main badal diya jaae
 Everyone in Bihar believes that the state has progressed under Nitish's rule, giving JD (U) an early lead
 lalu or nitish ke liye chunauti apane paramparaagat vot ko ek duusare ke paksh main vot karne ko raji karnaa he
 Lalu's influence in the coordination of seats is clearly visible
 argedy ke mukhiya jedy (you) ko 2010 main jeetin siten bhi chhodie ko majaboor kar chuke hai
 For example, his sons Tejashwi and Tej Pratap are fighting in Raghopur and Mahua respectively
 aise kai maamle hai lekin badale main argedy ne pichhali baar kii jiti madhubani jile ke babubarahi iklauti seat jedy (you) ke liye chodi
 In such a situation, the supporters of JD (U) rebel leaders remain with Nitish or turn to the other side, this question can decide the fate of many candidates
 bi jepi bhi in samasyaon se mukt nahin he
 Even when Amit Shah was finalizing his campaign strategy after Patna, the party was struggling to keep the rebels under control
 tikat na milane se naaraaz party kaaryakartaaon kaa mohabhang dur karne ke liye khaasi mashakt kerani pad rahi thi
 Nitish, however, has a strong anti-incumbency trend
 unke apane das saal ke raaj ke saath lalu-rabari ke daur kaa 15 saal kaa kathith jangal raaj bhi jud gaya he
 BJP leaders hope to benefit from another strategic mistake by lalu-nitish
 congress ke liye 41 siten hi chodi gai hai
 In 2010, Congress contested all the seats but won only four seats
 bijepi ke pravanndata devesh kumaar kehete he, “is baar abhi vot bhi nahin pade hai lekin aankada 41-0 kaa lagane laga he
 "nevertheless, in this very closely contested election, many equations and calculations can be very reversible
 (saath main shweta punj) Amid tensions between the political leadership and the military in Pakistan, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said on Friday that he did not need a vote of confidence in Parliament
 gilaani ne ye baaten neshnal asembli main kahi
 Earlier on Wednesday, Geelani removed Naeem Khalid Lodhi, who is considered close to Army Chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, from the post, after which the army chief called a meeting of top commanders
 gilaani ne ek chini samachar-patr ko die saakshaatkaar main kayaani or desh kii khufia agency inter-services intelegence (iesai) ke pramukh leftinent general shuja pasha par samvidhan ke ulanghan kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha tha ki unhone america ko bheje gaye 'gopneey sandesh' maamle kii jaanch kar rahe sarvocch nyaayalay ke samaksh avaidh jawaab daakhil kiye
 The army reacted to this and warned of 'grave consequences'
 tabhi se pakistan main sainya vidroh kii atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai
 Whether or not there is a Modi wave in the country, they will tell the results of the Lok Sabha elections, but from Facebook to whatsapp, the magic of bjp's PM candidate has been overshadowed

 loksabhaa chunaav main prachaar ke dauraan bhartiya janata party or pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jor-shor se sarkaar dwaara chalaai gai pariyojnaon kaa bakhaan kiya
 One of these is the Saubhagya scheme to provide electricity to every household
 'pradhanmantri sahaj bijli ghar yojana- saubhaahgya', kii safalataa kaa daawa karte hue piem modi ne amroha main kaha tha ki 77 lakh bina bijli vaale gharon main bijli pahunchaai gai he
 But with the end of the election, the truth of this has started to come to light
 modi sarkaar dwaara chalaai gai adhikansh yojanaayen band filein main dabi hui hai or logon ko raahat dene main naakaamayaab rahi hai
 The Saubhagya scheme, which provides free electricity connections to villagers, has also failed completely
 jabaki piem modi kaa daawa he ki desh ke har gaanv tak bijli pahunchaai gai or lakhon gharon ko bijli ke conection die gaye hai
 But this truth is something else
 india today ne agra ke khandauli ke kai gaanvon kaa daura kiya, jahaan saubhaahgya yojana ke antargat lagbhag 100 conection die gaye lekin june kii garmi main yahaan ab bhi bydaree ke pankhons kaa istemaal ho rahaa hai or yahaan bijli kii koi vyavastha nahin he
 The villagers say that they have been fooled by saying that in the name of Saubhagya scheme, Power Corporation will send bill of thousands without giving electricity
 painti kheraa gaanv ke zyaadaatar logon ne taron main cat daal kar bijli kaa intejaam kiya hua he
 While this village comes under Saubhagya scheme
 vahiin gaanv main rahane vaale jitendra prasad ne bataaya ki 67 maheene pehle unke ghar ke baahar meter lagaaya gaya, lekin unhen conection nahin diya or na hi koi bill aayaa
 An employee of Dakshinchal Vidyut Nigam Limited told India Today that under the Saubhay scheme these works are given to the contractors and most of the contractors put meters outside the applicants' houses and gave their photographs
