 The letter has written that Anushka Sharma has got permission from the board to stay around Virat during this tour
 haalanki team management ne is mudde par chuppi saadh rakhi he or kisi tarah kii tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya
 Earlier such permission was not allowed
 is baar team management ne cricketron ko apni patni or bacchon ko bhi saath rahane kii ijaajat de di he
 In Nottingham, Murali Vijay's wife Nikita and son Naveen were staying with him in the hotel
 cheteshwar pujaara or gautam gambhir bhi apni-apni patniyon ke saath vahaan maujuud the
 Gautam Gambhir's three-month-old daughter was also with him
 lekin sabase dilachasp baat to yah rahi ki team ke fielding coach, unki patni, betaa or beti bhi usee hotel main tehre
 This time a lot of support staff has been brought with the team
 team or uske staff ke liye nottingham main kul 21 kamare book karaae gaye the
 Raghavendra, who threw the team's ball, also stayed in the same hotel
 iske alaava trainer, assistant coach vagairah sabhi usamen tehre
 Critics say that when a big cricketer and film star are together, they should be seen crowded , which distracts the attention
 isliye is baar is team ke ird-gird khaasi bheed jamaa ho rahi he
 If a Muslim goes to one side, a Hindu will go against him
 isse miltaa-julata vishleshan aap tivi par khub sunate honge
 It is difficult to understand on what basis are the information sitting in the TV studio with the pictures of voting coming
 hamaari raajnneeti main dharmik aadhaar par dhruvikaran ek tathy he, magar yah myth bhi he
 Polarization has become a tool of superficial and general interpretation, with the help of which the knowledgeable paints a voter with communal color
 isi ke saath ek or myth kii rachana karne lagate hai - 'tactical voting' kaa myth
 One side is Muslim and the other side is Hindu
 aisa lagata he ki studio main baithe jaankaar ek khaas samudaay kii taraf ishaara kar rahe hai ki musalmaan ekajute ho rahe hai
 Hindus are uniting against BJP, so naturally Hindus should also unite in favor of BJP
 akhbaaron main bhi aisi baaten khub likhi ja rahi hai
 Many times it seems that this is being done under a strategy
 matdaan prakriya kaa ek adana-sa export bhi jaan saktaa he ki kuchhek apwaadon ko chhod saamaanya rup se yah baat sahi nahin he
 At times, it seems that during the elections, with the help of such analysis, the work of inciting communalism in the society is done
 kya hindu hameshaa yah dekhakar vot detaa he ki musalmaan kis taraf vot de rahaa he yaa musalmaan yah dekhakar vot detaa he ki hindu kis taraf detaa he
 What is its scientific basis? har chunaav main muslim matadaata ko brands karne kaa khel khelaa jaataa he
 As such he has no aspirations of his own and he only votes as a Muslim
 agar aisa hota to yah baat sahi hoti ki ek aam muslim matadaata imam bukhari jaise dharmaguruon ke kehane par hi vot kar detaa
 If we look at the data of any election, it proves to be wrong
 aam muslim matadaata bade aaraam se matdaan ke faisle main mullah-maulaviyon kii dakhsandaazi ko pasand nahin karata
 He also speaks openly, but the media continues to denounce Muslim voters on the pretext of such religious leaders
 isi sandarbh main ek or baat kahana chahta hum
 Many yogis and religious leaders like Baba Ramdev also ask for votes for a party
 imam bukhari kaa apil karnaa sampradayik or baba ramdev yaa shankaracharya kaa apil karnaa rashtrabhakti
 how? i am not comparing the two, but the basic thing is that all kinds of religious leaders are active during elections
 koi aashirwad ke naam par inke paas jaataa he to koi apane bhaashanon main devi-devataaon ke pratikon kaa istamaal karke dharm kaa istamaal karata he
 What do you call an angel of God? aam matadaata ko isse sachet hone kii zarurat he
 It is also a matter to keep in mind that the gurus of all our religions have a deep connection with society
 jhat se unke kisi raajnneetik aacharan ko sampradayik qaraar dene se pehle dekhnaa chahie ki ve kyon aisa kar rahe hai
 Their base is communal, religious or political
 agar virodh karnaa he to ek saath deron, mathon, masjidon kii raajnneetik dakhsandaazi kaa virodh kiijie
 i return again, to my original point
 tamaam adhyayan bataate hai ki muslim matadaata apni pasand ke hisaab se alag-alag rajyon main alag-alag party or netaa ko vot karata he
 Muslims vote not one but several parties as well as BJP
 madhya pradesh, rajasthan or gujarat main bhi karata he
 It may be less in percentage terms, but you can also see how many Muslim candidates BJP has fielded in these states in the Lok Sabha elections
 uttar pradesh main kitne utaare hai
 In the last Lok Sabha election, BJP got 25-26 percent votes, the rest and 75 percent votes to other parties
 agar hindu vot jaisaa kuch hota to bijepi ko 75 fisadi vot milte
 Our experts also do injustice to the conscience of Hindu voters
 matadaataaon kaa ati hindookaran kar sampradayik rang dete hai
 Let us look at this in another way
 har samudaay yaa jati ke log apane ummidavaaron ko vot dete hai
 On this basis, Congress and BJP all decide their candidates
 tab bhi bijepi ko haraane ke liye musalmaan kisi musalmaan ummidavaar ko vot nahin karata he
 He will vote for the same party or candidate who has enough votes
 yah vot kahaan se aata he
 It is allegedly not from Hindu society, how can it be justified that Hindus go on one side and Muslims on the other side
 kaayade se to ek-duusare kii party ko haraane ke liye donon mil-julkar ek-duusare ke khilaaf golband hote hai
 Even then, not all Muslims will vote for any individual or party
 musalamaanon ko kathith rup se bijepi ke khilaaf pesh kiye jane ke baad bhi jaankaar jaanate hai ki ve kahin bhi ekamusth voting nahin karte
 This is also not possible
 aisa hone laga to samajhie ki muslim samaaj ke bheetar aapasi takaraav hi samaapt ho jaaen
 You also know that there is a strong conflict between the Muslims for the rights of forward-backward and Dalit Muslims
 pichley dinon kai rajyon - jaise uttar pradesh, kerala or assam, main muslim dalon kaa udai hua he, or kya ye sabhi bijepi ke khilaaf ubhare hai? nahin
 Congress, SP, BSP, Left also face challenge from them
 isiilie jaankaron ko dhruvikaran kii behad satahi or khatarnaak vyakhya se bachanaa chahie
 When Narendra Modi was going for his nomination in Benaras, the cameras were looking for Muslims in that crowd
 unka chlose ap dikhaa rahe the
 i object to this
 kya camere us bheed main shaamil anya logon ko bhi usee nigaah se dekh rahe the
 If not, then why was one or two Muslims being searched? tab bhi, jab narendra modi ke saath muqataar abbaas nakvi nazar aa rahe the
 The BJP may follow the dictates of Hindutva or the Sangh, but not every vote it gets
 bijepi ke kaaryakarta chahen jitna hindutv ke rang-rup main dhalakar aakraamak ho jaaen, unki party ko milane vaala har vot hindu vot nahin he
 Most Dalit voters may object to being seen by associating themselves with this identity, while they may vote for the BJP
 hamen janamat kaa sampradayikaran nahin karnaa chahie
 Communalism and polarization is the dangerous truth of our politics, but it is not everywhere under one formula that Hindus will go away if Muslims go here
 kai baar lagata he ki jaankaar muslim matadaataaon kaa mazahabi charitra chithran karte hue gaiyr-muslim matadaataaon ko ishaara kar rahe hote hai ki unhen vot kahaan dena chahie
 The lives of the tribes of Korba and Birhor, who spent many decades in the jungles with rugged and archery, have started a new change in their lives
 saamaanya pariwaron se alag jeevanstyli main jeene vaala chhattisgarh kaa korba samudaay ab ek nai disha kii ore chal padaa he
 While many families who have been fed by hunting and fruits and flowers etc
 have adopted farming and farming, they are on the path of doing something new with a new hope
 kal tak jin haathon main tir-kaman or chidiya maarane vaali gulel hua karti thi, aaj unheen haathon main kalam or kitaaben hai
 There are more than 610 hill Korba families in Korba district
 korba vikaskhand main 590 parivaar durgam ilaakon main rahete hai, jahaan inke rahan-sahan kii style kai paramparaon se bandhi he
 The initiative to connect Korba families to the mainstream of the society continues
 colector rajat kumaar in ilaakon kaa daura kar na sirf vikaas kaaryon kii jaankaree lete rahete hai, balki inaki basaahaton ke aas-paas chaoupal lagaakar unki apekshaaon ko bhalee-bhaanti samajhane kii koshish bhi karte hai
 a number of schemes have been launched by the administration for the development of hill Korba
 mahatma gandhi rojgaar guarantee yojana (manaregaa) ke tahat jameen ko baraabar kiya gaya he
 Wells etc
 have also been constructed here
 iske alaava van adhikaar patta dene, indira awaas, peyajal kii vyavastha karne ke saath hi inhen vikaas kii mukhyadhara se jodne kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 Along with this, initiatives have been taken to give jobs to the people of Korba tribe
 inhen prayaason kaa nateeja he ki korba janajati ke pariwaron main ek nayaa badlaav aayaa he
 The hallmark of change in Pahari Korba is the story of student Nathuram
 korba vikaskhand ke gram daldali main rahane vaala natthuram ab 10veen kaksha tak pahunch chukaa he
 Prior to this, no hill Korba boy had reached class 10 in this area or in his village
 kuch bachche skool gaye lekin paanchavin-chhathi se aathvin tak aate-aate skool chhod diya
 a Korba child is studying in the Nathuram hostel and wants to become a policeman
 yahaan ke shikshak sidaar kaa kahana he ki 10veen kaksha main aakar natthuram kii soch viksit hui he
 Similarly, Korba child Sunnyram father Kolaram, resident of Umbrasarai, is now studying in class ninth
 uski bhi ichha sarkari naukari karne or ek acha jivan vyateet karne kii he
 Rajaram, a student of village marshes, is studying in class 10th
 birhor janajati ke balak rajaraam kii ichha shikshak banane kii he
 The main means of livelihood of all these families is wages
 gram ajgar bahaar ke chatravaas main rahakar hai skool main padhai kar rahe teenon chaatro kaa kahana he ki shashan dwaara ni:shulk kitaaben, uniform samay par milti hai
 At the same time, the arrangement of accommodation with scholarship motivates them to study further
 kendriya vitt mantri pranab mukherjee ne videshon main padaa kaala dhan waapas laane ke liye sarkaar kii ranneetiyon par somvaar ko loksabhaa main shwet patr pesh kiya, lekin isamen dhan kaa byora nahin he
 The letter, however, emphasizes the formation of institutions like Lokpal and Lokayukta
 shwet patr main dhan kaa byora na dene kii vajah iskaa koi ek aankada or iske bare main pataa lagane ke liye koi sarvamaanya vidhi kaa nahin hona bataaya gaya he
 The letter states, "there is no reliable data on black money nor is there any universally accepted method to detect it
" ab tak jo bhi akalan aae hai, sabhi alag-alag tarah ke hai
 " shwet patr main kaha gaya he ki aam dharna yah he ki bharatiyon kii ek badi rakam swiss bainkon main jamaa he

 The reason for not giving the details of money in the white paper is stated to be one of its figures and no universally accepted method to find out about it
 patr main kaha gaya he, "kaale dhan ko lekar koi vishwasaneey aankada nahin he or na hi iskaa pataa lagane ke liye koi sarvamaanya pravidhi he
 The assessments that have come so far are all different types
 " The white paper states that the general perception is that a large amount of Indians have deposits in Swiss banks
 ek akalan ke anusaar, varsh 2006 se 2010 ke bich swiss bainkon main bharatiyon ke dhan jamaa karne ke maamalon main kami ai he
 In the year 2006, where it was Rs 23,373 crore, in 2010 it was recorded at Rs 9,295 crore
 shwet patr main kaale dhan kii maatra kaa pataa lagane ke liye gathit samiti kii report bhi shaamil nahin kii gai he

 pulavama main hue aatanki hamale ke paanch din tak congress is mudde par chup rahane ke mangalvaar ko modi sarkaar par hamalavar ho gai he
 Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi has raised several questions to the Modi government on Pulwama by tweeting one after the other
 singhvi ne kaha ki 2014 jaise pehle choti-choti ghatnaon par istipha maangane vaale narendra modi bataaen kya yahi 56 inch kaa seenaa he?singhvi ne kaha ki pulavama hamale ke baad congress ne puri jimmedaari nibhaai he
 At the same time, before 2014, Narendra Modi used to demand resignation even on small incidents, but we have not done this after the Pulwama attack
 lekin pulavama main jis tarah suraksha main chook hui he, usne kai tarah ke sawaal khadey kar die hai
 Singhvi said in the next tweet that sending 2500 soldiers from Jammu to Srinagar in 78 vehicles simultaneously was a big mistake of the government
 iske alaava is dauraan aam logon ke vaahanon ko vahaan se guzarane dena bhi ek badi chook he
 That too at a time when the alert of Jaish's fidayeen attack by intelligence agencies has continued
 kya yahi 56 inch kii seenaa he?bataa den ki jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main 14 farvari ko yani guuruuvaar ko aatankiyon ne hamalaa karke siarpief ko 40 javaanon ko shahid kar diya gaya tha
 After this attack, Congress President Rahul Gandhi held a press conference and supported every move of the government and the army
 is dauraan rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki agle kuch dinon wo koi bhi raajnneetik baaten nahin karenge
 After five days of the Pulwama terror attack, the Congress has started questioning the Modi government
 somvaar ko singhvi ne amit shah par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha tha ki jo log pulavama hamale par raajnneetik laabh lene kii koshish kar rahe hai, unhen desh kii janata maaf nahin karengi
 He said that Congress can never do politics on the issue of national security and stands with the soldiers and government of our country
 singhvi ne kaha ki desh ke naagarik ke taur par hamen pulavama kii ghatana par aakrosh prakat karne kaa puraa adhikaar he, lekin agar koi raajnneetik dal yaa sanghathan is maamle main raajnneeti karata he athwa raajnneetik laabh kii koshish karata he to mujhe lagata he ki desh kii janata ise upyukt nahin samajhegi or maaf bhi nahin karegi
 Actually, BJP President Amit Shah is constantly mentioning in his rallies on Pulwama case
 ravivaar ko assam or somvaar ko jaipur main bolte hue kaha tha ki centre kii narendra modi sarkaar desh ke javaanon ke balidaan ko vyarth nahin jane degi or sena makul jawaab degi

 The Chhattisgarh Police, having achieved a major breakthrough, has arrested six Naxalites, including the self-styled Naxal commander Barsa Lakhma, who was allegedly involved in the killing of 76 security personnel last month
 police adheekshak amaresh mishra ne bataaya ‘hamane ravivaar raat alag-alag ghatnaon main chintalnar se chaar kilometre dur morapali se lakhma sahit chah logon ko giraftaar kiya’
 These people are accused of involvement in the killing of 75 security personnel of CRPF and 76 security personnel including a state police personnel on April 6
 swatantraaa ke baad suraksha karmiyon par yah sabase bada hamalaa tha
 The arrested Naxalites told the police during interrogation that the security personnel became helpless after losing the wireless set of deputy commandant of the 62nd battalion of CRPF
 lakhma ne bataaya ki naksali wireles set kii madad se ardhsainik balon kii gatividhiyon par kareeb se najar rakhe hue the
 The superintendent of police said that the other Maoists arrested include Oyam Hidma Podiyami Hidma Kawasi Budra Oya Ganga and Durga Joga
 inhen tarmetala se paanch kilometre dur minapa gaanv se giraftaar kiya gaya
 They told the police that they were closely monitoring the CRPF personnel, even on their 'picnic' on April 5, during which the wireless set of CRPF deputy commandant was lost
 ghatana ke baad in chah naksaliyon ne sheersh naksal netaa ramanna or paparav ko vistrut byora diya
 During this, the 'assurance' of CRPF was also discussed
 mishra ne bataaya ki giraftaar naksaliyon ke anusaar siarpief company ko nishane ke rup main isliye chunaa gaya kyonki vah puure din ek hi sthaan par rukii rahi or naksali surakshakarmiyon kii gatividhiyon par lagaataar najar rakhe hue the
 Naxalites said that the final decision to carry out the killing was taken when the wireless set started ringing at 3 am on April 6 and the soldiers were asked to return to the spot to find the lost wireless set of deputy commandant
 in naksaliyon kii giraftaar aise samay hui he jab centre ne siarpief ke up mahanireekshak nalin prabhaat 62veen batalian ke commandent or ek nireekshak kaa tabadalaa kar diya he
 In view of the report of ER Rammohan, the transfer of Mishra and Inspector General of Chhattisgarh Police TJ Long Kumir have also been recommended, who are accused of not making proper plans to dominate the area
 haalanki sabhi abhiyaan baithkon main shaamil rahe up mahanireekshak kallori kaa koi ullekh nahin kiya gaya
 According to the investigation, the 81-member CRPF team, including a head constable of Chhattisgarh police, did not leave for their mission at 7 pm on April 4, as recorded in the logbook
 surakshakarmiyon ne vastav main agle din subah paanch baje jangal main ghusna shuru kiya jabaki disha nirdeshon main subah ke samay jangal main jane ke liye manaa kiya gaya tha
 The CRPF company spent the entire day at the same place where the jawans became targets of Naxalite firing in the early hours of April 6
 siarpief ke kuch varisht karmiyon ne paas ke gaanv mukaram ke pradhan sahit kuch logon ko bulaakar bade bartan laane ko bhi kaha tha taaki puri team ke liye khaanaa banaaya ja sake
 The CRPF and policemen have been strictly forbidden to seek the help of villagers or local people in the rules of the campaign and to maintain maximum secrecy
 sutron ne bataaya ki abhiyaan kii gopneeyata us samay bhang ho gai jab siarpief kii company graminon ko charpai or anya saamagree laane kaa aadesh dekar ek hi jagah puraa din bitaane ke baad najadik ke ‘ashram’ ek hostel main chali gai
 The battalion of the CRPF was to take its position on a small hillock near the spot by the evening which was strategically important for dominance in the area
 centre ne rammohan se ghatana kii jaanch karaae jane kaa aadesh diya tha jinhone 26 april ko apni report saunp di jisamen unhone chhattisgarh police or siarpief ke bich samanvay kii kami kaa zikr kiya
 The England cricket team has been in India for 18 days but as of now its players have not received the daily allowance from the BCCI as the two boards have not yet signed the memorandum of understanding
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne pehle teen test ke liye prati match lagbhag 58 
 6 lakh has been sanctioned but does not include the daily allowance
 abhi tak england team ko zyada pareshaani nahin ai lekin bharat sarkaar ke notebandi ke faisle kaa un par paroksh prabhaav padaa he kyonki noton kii simit aapurti bhi khatm ho rahi he

 So far the England team has not faced much trouble but the Indian government's decision on demonetisation has had an indirect effect on them as limited supply of notes is also ending

 This time, Ajsu increased the demand for his seats from the BJP, due to which the friendship of the two has been broken

 The Supreme Court on Wednesday said that the reconsideration petition will be heard on the basis of incorrect photocopy of confidential documents in the Rafale deal

 co / dqmlcdyrr5 — Congress (@incindia) April 10, 2019 Center argues: Outside the purview of the documents RTI, Attorney General KK Venugopal had said that no one can present these documents in the court without the permission of the concerned department
 ye dastavej oficial sikret act ke tahat surakshit hai
 Are also outside the purview of RTI under section 8 (1) (a)
 tab, chif justise ranjan gogoi ne kaha tha ki jab ham centre kii aapatti par faisla karne ke baad hi punarvichaar yachikaaon ke duusare pahaluon par sochenge
 Prashant Bhushan had objected to the central government's argument, but Prashant Bhushan has not justified the objection of the Center
 unhone kaha ki centre kii daleel durbhaavnapurna he
 The government cannot claim privilege on such documents, which have already come before everyone
 dhara 123 main vahi dastavej surakshit hai, jinka prakaashan naa ho, ve saamne na aae ho
 However, this document is in the public domain
 is maamle main dephence ke dastovaj pehle se logon ke saamne he
 The central government has not registered a case in the case yet
 jab sarkaar ne sieji report pesh kii, to vah privillaged dastavej kaiseh prashanth bhushanprashanth bhushan ne kaha ki sieji report sarkaar ne pesh kiya he
 It contains information related to the defense deal
 sarkaar ne khud sieji report ko court main pesh kiya
 In such a way, how can a document presented on their behalf be called a Privileged document
 sarkaar khud hi apane logon ko aisi jaankaree li karti rahi he
 The defense minister's file noting was also leaked
 2ji maamle or kol block main bhi dastavej public domen main aae the
 If the document is necessary for the case, then it is useless that how and where it is brought from
 aarthik narmi or ucch mudrasphiti se nipatane ke lagbhag saare paaramparik rajkoshiya or maudrik tareekon ko istemaal kar chuki sarkaar ne ab in chunautiyon se nipatane ke liye paaramparik ke saath saath anveshi tareeke apnaane kii apil kii
 Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said at the Delhi Economic Conference today the options are very limited
 rajkoshiya or maudrik kadamon ke liye vikalp simit hote ja rahe hai
 However, there are possibilities of policy formulation in other areas
 unhone salaah di in chunautiyon se nipatane ke liye paaramparik tareekon ke saath saath nae anveshi tareekon kii jarurat he
 The Finance Minister admitted that the growth rate and investment are being hit due to inflation and tight monetary policy
 mantri ne kaha audyogic vruddhi main narmi vishesh chintaa kaa vishay he kyonki isse rojgaar prabhavit hota he
 He said that inflation is at such a level that cannot be accepted as well as concerns related to fiscal deficit and current account deficit

 To control inflation, policy interest rates have been increased 13 times since March 2010
 mukherjee ne kaha audyogic vruddhi main narmi vishesh chintaa kaa vishay he kyonki isse rojgaar prabhavit hota he
 Inflation is at such a level that it cannot be accepted
 
 There are also immediate problems related to fiscal deficit and current account deficit
 sarkaar ne 2008 main vaishvik mandi se asar se udyog jagat ko bachaane ke liye 1
 86 lakh crore, or a financial incentive package equal to three percent of GDP
 chaalu vitt varsh main aarthik narmi ke bich rajkoshiya ghate main badhotaree ke saath sarkaar ko aarthik gatividhiyon main kami se nipatane ke liye doosraa protsaahan package laana behad mushkil hoga
 Seeking the support of the opposition for implementing major economic reforms, the Finance Minister said that the government has taken the initiative to end the economic bottlenecks through various initiatives like National Manufacturing Policy, more FDI in retail and other financial sector legislation
 
 unhone kaha hamen bharosa he ki in maamalon par behatar sahmati se inhen teji se lagu karne main madad milegi
 The mob thrashed along with Swami Agnivesh, a social worker who had come to pay homage to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 virodh ke chalate agnivesh vaajapeyi ko shradhanjali nahin de paae or unhen waapas lautne ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 Swami Agnivesh told 'aaj Tak', i spoke to Harsh Vardhan Singh
 maine unhen bataaya ki krishna menon maarg nahin pahunch paaungaa to unhone kaha kibhartiya janata party(bhaajapa) ke karyaalay aa jaaie
 i was going to the BJP headquarters along with my two other colleagues to pay tribute, but my car was stopped at ITO
 swami agnivesh ne bataaya, 'maine dobaaraa harshavardhan singh ko phone kiya
 At the same time people started beating me, my turban was taken off and thrown away
 laat ghuson se maaraa
 It was a similar incident to Pakur, where BJP workers attacked me
 ' unhone kaha, 'bhaajapa netaaon ko is maamle ko gambhirtha se lenaa chahie
 The police is a witness to this incident
 unhen swatah sangyaan lekar karrwai kerani chahie
 We will file a case
 'gauratlab he ki 17 july 2018 ko bhi agnivesh par jharkhand ke pakur main bheed ne hamalaa kar diya tha
 Their clothes were torn
 agnivesh ne aarope lagaaya tha ki un par hamalaa karne vaale log bijepi yuva morcha ke kaaryakarta the
 However, the Jharkhand BJP had denied involvement of party workers in the case
 bajet spikar segment main wireles spikars ko lekar aajkal baari demand he
 Or just say that wireless products are in great demand nowadays, whether headphones or speakers
 lekin trend main ek kadam aage kii cheez smart connactivity fitures hai or is list main bharat nen amejon or google jaisi companiyon ke smart spikars ke naam shaamil hai
 They run on Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant respectively
 bazaar main kuch or companiyaan hai jo apane audio divises ke saath amejon ailexa kaa saport detii hai
 Smart speakers are introduced in the budget segment by Amazon and Google are not wireless
 is bich Boat ne kuch samay pehle apane wireles spikar Boat Stone 700A ko pesh kiya tha
 It has the support of in-built Alexa along with the features of wireless Bluetooth speakers
 aise main is spikar ko wais cmand ke jariye chalaaya ja saktaa he
 We have used this speaker for a long time and now we are going to tell its long term review
 company ne ise 3,199 rupee main launch kiya tha
 However, now it is being sold for Rs 3,990
 dizin, bild quality or spacifications:boat Stone 700A, Boat Stone 700 kaa apgraded varjan he
 Its look is very premium and the quality is quite rugged
 overol isaki body metal kii bani hui he or top or bottm par rabar kii coating di gai he
 There are buttons on the top panel
 in buttens main power on-of, bluetooth / ailexa batan, kol cat / risive or wolum rockers hai
 On the left panel, the aux in and DC socket are given
 iske vajan kii baat karen to ye kaaphi halkaa he or sies main bhi ye kaaphi chota he
 In this case, it can be easily carried
 company ne ise IPX6 reating vaala bataaya he
 That is, it can be used comfortably in the swimming pool and is also shock proof
 baaki spacifications kii baat karen to isamen 1
 Two 75-inch full range drivers are given and the total power output of this speaker is 10W RMS, which is better for this price range
 ye ek sterio spikar he, haalanki dravirs ko itani duuri par nahin rakhaa gaya he ki aap sepperation feel kar saken
 Both drivers are front facing
 isamen bluetooth varjan 4
 2 is given for connectivity
 isse 10 meter kii duuri se bhi spikar ko chalaaya ja saktaa he
 The battery in it is 2000mah, it takes 3 hours to fully charge
 overol parformens:sabase pehle main is spikar ke ragd quality kii tarif karnaa chaahunga
 Talking about sound quality, its quality surprised us according to the price range
 mid, hai or lo nots teenon hi keemat ke hisaab se behtareen he
 Especially the mids are quite sharp and clean
 audio quality kii baat main ye baat jarur jodna chahuga ki bahut zyada laud yaa lo nots yani base aapako nahin milegaa
 But you will be happy with what you get
 baaki 360 degree sound or saround ko aap jarur miss karenge
 For more loud audio quality you can use F&D W19 in this price range, here you will also get these built FM radio
 overol audio quality ke liye aapako duun ki zyada keemton vaale spikars isse zyada acha parform karte hai, jisamen JBL ke spikars shaamil hai
 Talk about Amazon Alexa Integration, which is one of its special features, so let me tell you here that this speaker does not work like a standalone smart speaker like Google Home or Amazon Echo
 haalanki isamen ek dadicated batan diya gaya he, jise aapako press karnaa hoga or ailexa ko wais cmand bhi dena hoga
 For this, you will have to download the Bot Nirvana app and login to Amazon Alexa account through it
 iske baad spikar ko batan press kar cmand de sakate hai
 In order to give commands to Alexa, remember this thing that in a connected smartphone, the Alexa app is always on in the background because the speaker will work with the help of the app itself
 yani sidhe myne main aapako har baar ailexa chalaane ke liye phone ke ailexa ap ko on karnaa hoga
 After connecting it runs very smooth
 saath hi aapako bataa den isamen kol cat or risive karne ke liye microphone bhi die gaye hai
 Apart from this, if you talk about Bluetooth connectivity range, then you will not have a complaint about the 10 meter connectivity range and auto connectivity once connected to the phone
 haalanki isamen adishnal connactivity ke liye USB port or memory card slot diya ja saktaa tha
 We have used it with oneplus 7 Pro and we did not face any problem in it
 bydaree kii baat karen to ise aap ek baar phul charge hone ke baad lagbhag 7 ghante tak chalaa sakate hai
 Verdict: This is a rugged and good audio-quality speaker, where Amazon Alexa is also supported
 aise main ek tarah se ye bajet wireles smart spikar he
 However, Alexa cannot be used as a standalone speaker
 phir bhi apni keemat ke hisaab se is spikar main sab kuch he
 In such a situation, customers can invest money without hesitation
 ek baat ye jarur he ki isamen 360 degree sound quality ke liye prayaas kiya ja saktaa tha
 The rest is quite a good speaker to buy in the budget

 uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti main beete do dashakon se ek apshagun chal rahaa he
 It is said that the Chief Minister who visited Noida in the last two decades has lost the chair
 is andhvishwaas ko todane kii himmat yuva mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav bhi nahin dikhaa paa rahe hai
 Perhaps that is why he did not attend the Asian Development Bank (ADB) meeting in Noida himself
 is baithak main pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke alaava do darjan se zyada deshon ke vitt mantri shaamil ho rahe hai
 Chief Minister Akhilesh asked his minister Brahma Shankar Tripathi to go there after he decided not to attend the four-day ADB meeting that started in Noida on May 2, but his health deteriorated as Health Minister Ahmed Hassan now represents the Chief Minister i will attend the meeting
 isse pehle do april ko noida se judi 3,500 karod rupee kii pariyojnaon kaa udghaatan or shilanyas akhilesh ne lakhanu main apane sarkari awaas se kiya tha
 Last year, he also inaugurated Yamuna Expressway from Lucknow
 akhilesh ke mukhyamantri rahete yun baar-baar noida jane se kataraane se sawaal uthta he ki kya rajya ke yuva or ejineering ke chaatr rah chuke mukhyamantri bhi totakon se darate hai? samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke rashtriya mahasachiv ram aasare kushvaha ne is par safai dete hue kaha, 'mukhyamantri vyastata ke kaaran noida nahin ja paae
 There is no question of bad omen koi sthaan kharaab nahin hota
 It is said that whichever leader goes to Noida while being Chief Minister, his chair is gone
 isliye uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri rahete hue netaa noida jane se tauba karte hai
 This sequence of totake has been going on for the last 20 years
 noida ke apshagun kaa dar aisa he ki kabhi uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri rahe rajnath singh ne noida main ek fliover kaa udghaatan bhi dilli se kiya tha
 When the Nithari incident took place in Noida, the then Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav did not go to Noida despite the immense pressure
 noida ko lekar yah totaka kalyaan singh ke samay se chalaa aa rahaa he
 20 years ago he went to Noida to attend an event, after which his chair went away
 varsh 1999 main tatkaaleen mukhyamantri ram prakaash gupta ke saath bhi aisa hi hua
 Mayawati, who was the chief minister in the previous Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) government, dared to break this myth and in 2011 she went to Noida, but lost the BSP in the subsequent assembly elections
 ab edibi kii baithak main akhilesh ke noida na jane par vipakshi dalon kahana he ki mukhyamantri kursi chhin jane ke andhvishwaas ke kaaran noida jane se dar rahe hai, jabaki soobe kii janata yuva mukhyamantri se dakiyanoosee vichaaron ko todane kii aas lagaae thi
 Senior Congress leader Pradeep Mathur termed the unfortunate absence of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav in the ADB meeting and said that if the Chief Minister also attended the ADB meeting in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the state would have benefited from it
 shagun-apshagun ke pher main baithak main mukhyamantri ke bhaag nahin lene se unki chhavi bigadegi
 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state spokesperson Vijay Bahadur Pathak said that the Chief Minister was afraid of going to Noida due to the superstition of going to the chair, while people hoped that the young Chief Minister would not accept such conservative views
 unhone bataaya ki unhen apane doston or parichiton ko iftaar dena tha
 They thought why Jama Masjid should be given iftar
 yahaan kaa iftaar bahut acha hota he
 His Muslim and non-muslim friends can enjoy the iftar here

 The clean sweep of the Test series against New Zealand has probably not landed on Team India
 
 
 england ke khilaaf rajkot test ke pehle do din ke khel ke baad to yahi lag rahaa he
 Before the start of the Test series, there was such an atmosphere in the cricket world, especially in the media, that the Alistair Cook Army is coming to play 'losing bet' in India
 kuch sports channels par to is baat ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki team india kis antar se siries par kabja karne ja rahi he
 While the opinion of some channels was 5–0, others were betting 4–0 or 4–1 in favor of Team India
 cricket ke diwane is desh main is baat kii ummid shaayad kisi ko nahin thi ki england ke ballebaaj, bhartiya khilaadiyon se apane wicket ke liye is kadar sangharsh karaayenge
 As the England team crosses the 500 mark, the situation seems to be completely reversing
 ab dabaav viraat kohli brigade par he
 The pair of Murali Vijay and Gautam Gambhir have reached 63 runs, saving their wickets till the end of the second day's play, but Team India's struggle is not over yet
 match ke tisare din yadi england kii team praarambhik satr main hi ek-do kamyaabi hasil karne main safal rahi to kuch bhi 
 
 
 Yes, anything can happen
 aise main swaabhaavik he team india kii pehali najar foloan ko taalane par tiki he
 If England's team came to the commanding position after scoring 311 for 4 wickets on the first day of the match, much of the credit goes to Team India's poor field
 pehle din bhartiya players ne english ballebaajon ke teen se chaar kaich tapakaae
 This catch was missed by Murali Vijay, Ajinkya Rahane and Virat Kohli
 mo
 The process of missing the catch in the first over of the innings thrown by Shami started even further
 inamen se zyaadaatar kaich slip main chute
 It seemed as if the fielding players had buttercream in their hands and the ball was sliding from their hands
 pehle din ke khel ke baad koching staff se jude sanjay bangar ne mana ki kaich drop karnaa team india ko baari padaa he
 The comments darasal slip main fielding kuch arse se team india kii kamjor kadi rahi he or coach anil kumble ko is disha main kaam karne kii jarurat he
 After the first day's game, England needed to make a big score and put pressure on Team India
 
 And Moeen Ali and Ben Stocks did exactly that
 shatakaveer root, moin or stokes kii baat to chhod den, puchhlle ballebaaj jafar ansaari ne bhi apane wicket ke liye bhartiya gendbaajon se puri mehnat karai
 England's score of 537 runs should not be heavy on India
 rajkot ke saurashtra cricket stadium kaa wicket abhi tak to ballebaaji ke anukool najar aayaa he, lekin aakhri teen dinon main isane ghoomana shuru kiya to team india kii mushkilen bad sakati hai
 Keep in mind the England team are three spinners Adil Rashid, Zafar Ansari and Moin Ali
 rhite arm leg brake, left arm leg spin or of spin kaa yah parfect kambination he

 ji haa kuch bhi ho saktaa he

 After the first day's play, Sanjay Bangar, who is associated with the coaching staff, admitted that dropping the catch was huge for Team India

 Barring the centuries, Root, Moin and Stocks, former batsman Zafar Ansari also worked hard with the Indian bowlers for his wicket
 england kaa 537 ran kaa score bharat par kahin baari na pade
 So far the Rajkot Saurashtra Cricket Stadium's wicket has looked batting-friendly, but in the last three days it has started revolving, then Team India's difficulties may increase
 dhyaan rakhie england team teen spinner adil rashid, jafar ansaari or moin ali he

 These included almonds, walnuts, pulses

 Tej Bahadur, a constable in BSF, came into the limelight after questioning the quality of food
 unhen baad main biguef se barkhaast bhi kar diya gaya tha
 Tej Bahadur has decided to contest against PM Narendra Modi from Varanasi Lok Sabha seat
 pehle tej bahadur ne nirdaleey pratyaashee ke taur par namakan kiya tha, lekin baad main sapa ne unhen tikat de diya
 But alleging that the information was hidden in the affidavit, the Returning Officer nominated Tej Bahadur
 sapa ne diya tha tej bahadur ko tiktasmaajawaadee party ne shuru main modi ke khilaaf shalini yadav ko tikat diya tha lekin baad main usne pratyaashee badal kar biguef ke barkhaast jawan tej bahadur ko varanasi sansadeey seat se ummidavaar banaaya

 haalanki, 29 april ko samaajawaadee party ummidavaar ke taur par daakhil duusare set main is soochna kaa zikr nahin kiya gaya tha
 Along with this, Yadav was also required to submit a No Objection Proof (NOC) from the Border Security Force, stating the reasons for the dismissal
 vahiin nirvachan adhikari ne kaha ki yadav pramaan patr pesh karne main vifal rahe kyonki janpratinidhi (arapy) adhinium ke tahat unhen is aashay kaa pramaan patr dena aavashyak tha ki unhen bhrashtachar yaa rajya ke prati nishthaheenata ke liye barkhaast nahin kiya gaya he
 Yadav has said in the petition filed through advocate Prashant Bhushan that the election officer's decision be rejected and the apex court should allow the petitioner to contest from the high-profile Varanasi parliamentary constituency

 isaki jagah paanch sau or do sau rupee ke noton ko laayaa gaya
 This is reducing the value of the notes being inserted in the ATM
 gaur karne kii baat he ki agar do hajaar ke noton se atm ko bharaa jaae to 60 lakh rupee tak aa jate hai
 With the notes of five hundred and hundred notes, this capacity is reduced to just Rs 15 to 20 lakhs
 iske alaava samasya kaa ek kaaran yah bhi he ki 200 ke note ke liye atm taiyaar nahin hai
 So far, only 30 per cent of atms have been calibrated for Rs 200
 yani 70 fisadi atm 200 kaa note dene main sakasham hi nahin hai
 Not only this, a random investigation by RBI has found that on average, about 30 per cent of atms are bad all the time
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha he ki desh main cash ke halaat kaa gauge liya
 Overall, more than enough cash is in circulation and banks also have it
 kuch ilaaqon main achaanak or badi hui maang se paidaa hui qillat se jald hi nibata ja rahaa he
 Here, the Minister of State for Finance says that there is no shortage of cash, it is a different matter that there is less then more
 unhone kaha ki 2-3 din main sab thik ho jayega
 Explain that cash is not being received from atms in many cities from Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh to Gujarat
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki kai bainkon kii shakhaon se bhi logon ko niraash lautnaa pad rahaa he
 It is being said that the rising npas in banks have shaken the banking system
 bainkon kii saakh par sawaal khadaa ho gaya he
 The speculation of using deposits in accounts to recover them has frightened customers
 aise main paisa nikaalane kii pravriti ekaek bad gai he or atm par dabaav chaar guna tak bad gaya he
 Due to lack of cash in most of the banks in North Bihar, atms and bank branches in the city and rural areas have caused a ruckus for money
 bihar ke mujffarpur ke bainkon ke karency cheston se samastipur, darbhanga, gopalganj, saaran, siwan, purvi va pashichami champaran ko nakadi di jaati he
 Cash is not being supplied in these districts for the last month and a half
 is kaaran yahaan bhi cash sankat gaharaa gaya he
 Due to the scarcity of cash in banks and atms in Gujarat, people are not taking the name of the pause
 kuch din pehle uttar gujarat main paidaa hue is sankat ne ab lagbhag puure rajya main apana pair pasaar liya he
 People are once again facing situations like demonetisation
 bainkon ne nakadi nikaalane kii seemaa tay kar di he, jabaki adhiktar atm main paisa hin nahin he

 bataa den ki uttar pradesh, uttarakhand, bihar, jharkhand, madhya pradesh se lekar gujarat tak ke kai shaharon main atm se nakadi nahin mil rahi he
 It is being told that people from many bank branches are also having to return disappointed
 kaha ja rahaa he ki bainkon main badhate enpie ne banking pranali ko hilaa kar rakh diya he
 The credibility of banks has been questioned
 inhen ubaarane ke liye khaaton main jamaa rakam ke istemaal kii atakalon ne graahakon ko daraa diya he
 In such a situation, the tendency to withdraw money has increased suddenly and the pressure on ATM has increased up to four times
 uttar bihar ke zyaadaatar bainkon main nakadi nahin hone se shahar se lekar gramin kshetron main atm va bank shakhaon main rupee ke liye haahaakaar machaa he
 Cash is given from the currency chests of banks in Muzaffarpur, Bihar to Samastipur, Darbhanga, Gopalganj, Saran, Siwan, East and West Champaran
 pichley dedh maah se in jilon main cash kii aapurti nahin ho rahi he
 Due to this, the cash crisis has deepened here too
 gujarat main bainkon or atm main nakadi kii killat ke kaaran logon kii mushkile thamane kaa naam nahin le rahi hai
 This crisis, which arose in north Gujarat a few days ago, has now spread to almost the entire state
 logon ek baar phir notebandi jaise halaat kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Banks have set cash withdrawal limit, while most atms do not have money at all
 gujarat ke mahesena, patan, sabarkantha, banaaskantha, modasa ke alaava ahmedabad, vadodara, surat jaise bade shaharon main bhi nakadi sankat bana hua he
 The comments bataa den ki pichley saal may main do hajaar ke noton ko chhapana band kar diya gaya tha
 It was replaced by five hundred and two hundred rupee notes
 isse atm main daale ja rahe noton kii vailu kam ho rahi he
 It is to be noted that if the ATM is filled with two thousand notes, then up to 60 lakh rupees are brought
 paanch sau or sau ke noton se ye kshamta mahaj 15 se 20 lakh rupee rah gai he
 Apart from this, one reason for the problem is that atms are not ready for 200 notes
 abhi tak mahaj 30 fisadi atm hi 200 rupee ko lekar caleabratt ho sake hai
 That is, 70 percent of atms are not able to give 200 notes
 itnaa hi nahin arabiai kii random jaanch main paaya gaya he ki kareeb 30 fisadi atm ausatan har samay kharaab rahete hai

 i want to shoot my best in Rio too
 nateeja kya hoga isaki parvaah nahin
 The result is important but my shoot should be excellent

 " tippaniyan Rio's Mahakumbh will be the fifth Olympic Games for 33-year-old Bindra
 is dauraan unhen team india ke flag bearar yani dhwajvahak banane kaa bhi mauqaa mila he or unhone ise fair ke saath sweekaar bhi kar liya
 In fact, in the last Olympic Games, the competition of 10 meters air rifle has been held on the very next day of the opening ceremony
 is vajah se bindra kai baar udghaatan samaaroh kii parade main bhi shaamil nahin ho paye
 But this time the opening ceremony will be held in Rio on 5 August while their competition is on 8 August
 bindra ne rio olympix tak ke liye apni planning par hameshaa kii tarah bahut jor diya he
 From the method of preparation to the flight detail and return, plans have been made well
 bas 8 agast kaa unka imtihaan unki yojana ke mutabik hi ho, to rio main ye bhartiya khilaadi ek baar phir itihaas ke panne par dastakhat karata nazar aayega
 In 2014, during the Incheon Asian Games, he said that he will continue to shoot as a 'hobby shooter' (amateur shooter)
 bindra ne inchiyan asian khelon main pehali baar nijee spardhaa main to padak jeeta hi, vahaan team kaa padak bhi bharat ke hi naam hua
 Talking to NDTV before going to Rio Olympics, Bindra said that Rio would be his last Olympic Games
 unase puche jane par ki wo rio main kya hasil karnaa chaahate hai? wo kehete hai, "main qareeb 20 saal se shoot kar rahaa hum
 i do not want to compare myself to Beijing
 main chahta hum ki rio main bhi apana behtareen shoot karun
 i do not care what the result will be
 nateeja ahm he lekin meri shooting behtareen honi chahie
 Rio will be the last Olympic Games for me
 " "will you quit shooting completely after this?" Bindra says, "I will not shoot
 shooting se kisi tarah judaa zarur rahoonga
 "comments 33 saal bindra ke liye rio kaa mahakumbh paanchaven olympic khel honge
 During this time he also got the opportunity to become the flag bearer of Team India and he accepted it with Fakhr
 darasal pichley olympic khelon main 10 meter air ricel kii pratiyogita opening seremani (udghaatan samaaroh) ke agle hi din yojit hoti rahi he
 Due to this, Bindra could not attend the parade of the inauguration ceremony many times
 lekin is baar udghaatan samaaroh rio main 5 agast ko yojit honge jabaki unki pratiyogita 8 agast ko he
 Bindra has always emphasized his planning for the Rio Olympics as usual
 taiyaari ke tareeke se lekar flite detail or lautne tak kii yojana bakubi banaai gai he
 If his test of August 8 is according to his plan, then this Indian player in Rio will once again be seen signing on the pages of history

 BJP will protest at 400 places in Delhi on water pollution; After air pollution in Delhi, there has started a fierce battle over contaminated water
 dilli bhartiya janata party(bijepi) ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne elaan kiya he ki somvaar ko dilli main bijepi 400 jagahon par pani kii kharaab quality ko lekar joardaar pradarshan karegi
 It will also take a sample of water from all places and send it to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 bijepi kaa daawa he ki hamaari sarkaar aane par teen saal main dilli main nal se sidhe pine kaa pani pahunchaaya jayega
 BJP says that maximum water purifiers are being purchased in Delhi
 biies kii report main khulaasa hua he ki 20 rajyon main sabase zyada zaharila pani dilli kaa he
 Not only Delhi's air but water is also the most polluted
 bhartiya maanak beuro (biies) ne dilli ke saath hi 20 rajyon kii rajdhaniyon ke peyajal ke namoonon kii jaanch karai
 In this, samples of piped water were collected from 11 places in Delhi, most of which failed to meet the standards

 In Uttarakhand and Manipur, where it lost its government, it got just 7 seats in Uttar Pradesh, the largest state in the country with 403 assembly
 punjab main uski sarkaar jarur bani lekin goa main party bahumat nahin paa saki
 The success of Congress leaders has also started answering successive defeats after another and till yesterday, the leaders who have kept silence on every question related to 10 Janpath are now beginning to question Rahul Gandhi's leadership ability
 2013 main bane the party ke upaadhyaksharahul gandhi ko 2013 main congress kaa upaadhyaksh banaaya gaya tha
 This was the time when UPA was in power at the center and Congress was in power in many states of the country but today the situation is that the party does not have mps to become the main opposition party in Lok Sabha and in most states the party has been out of power
 is
 rahul bhale hi congress ke upaadhyaksh hon lekin sonia gandhi beemaari ke chalate lambey samay se raajnneeti main sakriy nahin hai or party ke sabhi faisle sidhe-sidhe rahul gandhi dwaara hi liye ja rahe hai isliye ek ke baad ek rajyon main hoti ja rahi haar ke liye bhi ab unhen hi jimmedaar tehraaya jane laga he
 Now Satyavrat Chaturvedi said - Congress needed cosmetic surgery, the victory in 2009 was sparked by Rahul Gandhi, when the Congress came out stronger in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections than in 2004, much of the credit was given to Rahul Gandhi
 khaskar uttar pradesh main congress ke 21 saansad jitkar aane ko puri tarah rahul gandhi kii uplabdhi bataakar pesh kiya gaya
 After this, whenever Manmohan's cabinet expanded, the first question was whether Rahul Gandhi would become a minister at the center
 2013 main to khud manmohan singh ne ye kahkar sabko chaunkaa diya ki wo rahul gandhi ke netritv main kaam karne ko taiyaar hai
 But that was about the time when the process of writing defeat after succession started on the foreheads of Rahul and Congress
 2012 main chaar rajyon main haari congrescongress ko pehla bada jhatka 2012 main tab laga jab upi main 21 saansad vaali ye party mahaj 28 siten jeet saki
 The Congress was said to be a natural contender for victory in Punjab, but the akali-bjp alliance managed to form a government again by surprise
 haar kii ek badi vajah rahul gandhi dwaara amarinder singh ko ishaaron-ishaaron main siem candidet ghoshit karne ko bhi bataaya gaya or party 117 vidhansabha vaale is rajya main mahaj 46 siten jitkar phir ek baar vipaksh main baithne ko majaboor hui
 In Goa too, the Digambar Kamat Congress government had to face defeat
 uttarakhand main party ko bijepi se bahut najdiki mukaable main jeet mili to manipur main jarur congress sarkaar banane main kaamyaab rahi
 At the end of the same year, the Congress once again had to face defeat in Gujarat, while it managed to win in Himachal
 haar ke baar haar, lagaataar2013 main congress ko tripura, nagaland, dilli, rajasthan, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh jaise rajyon main kaarari haar mili
 Excluding Mizoram and Meghalaya, the good news for him came only from Karnataka, although here too the Congress's victory for the party and the bjp's infamy caused by the Yeddyurappa episode were seen as a big reason
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main congress kii jeet kii ummid to kisi ne nahin kii thi lekin wo mahaj 44 siton tak simat jaaegi aisi kalpana bhi uske dhur virodhiyon ko nahin thi
 The same year the party lost power in Haryana and Maharashtra
 jharkhand, jammu-kashmir main bhi uski karaari haar hui
 He tasted victory by joining the Grand Alliance in Bihar in 2015, but this year he got a real shock in Delhi where he could not get a single seat
 2016 bhi congress ke liye koi acchhee khabar lekar nahin aayaa
 This year, a large state like Assam passed from his hands
 kerala main bhi uski gathbandhan sarkaar haar gai jabaki pashchim bengal main left ke saath chunaav ladane ke baavjood uskaa supada saaf ho gaya
 However, his government was formed in Puducherry
 aage bhi nahin dikhti ummid kii kiranis saal ke ant main gujarat or himachal pradesh main chunaav hone vaale hai
 The way the party is losing out from universities to local body elections and is not ready to learn any lesson from any of its defeats, it is like taking a risk to stake its victory in these states too
 party main rahul gandhi ko adhyaksh banane kii maang lagaataar uth rahi he lekin sawaal ye he ki adhyaksh banane ke baad rahul aisa koun sa kadam uthaaenge jo wo ab nahin uthaa paa rahe hai
 Rahul's becoming president is now only a technical process and no one is going to believe that something is happening in Congress today without his consent
 na leadership main karishma, na ranneeti main nayapanupi-chunaav main rahul or akhilesh yadav ke gathbandhan ko munh kii khaani padi he
 Despite the loss of Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party more than Rahul, in these elections, Akhilesh Yadav emerged as a leader who talks to the people in his language and opponents (among whom Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself is the top ) Knows how to answer in the same way
 jo media ke tikhe sawaalon se asahaj nahin hota or saarvajanik maukon par puure aatmavishvaas ke saath bharaa najar aata he
 Nothing like this was seen in Rahul Gandhi
 aaj bhi unke bhaashan thik vaise hi hai jaise pichley vidhansabha chunaav or loksabhaa chunaav main the
 Neither are they able to present any vision to the public nor are they able to defend the serious allegations against Congress
 aise main unki leadership congress ko uske sabase bure daur se kaise baahar nikaalegi is sawaal kaa jawaab congressi hi nahin, balki puraa desh talash rahaa he
 Since the beginning of this year, the eyes of the entire country have been focused towards the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 upi ko centre kii raajnneeti kii dhuree samajha jaataa he, isliye is pradesh par raaj karne kaa sapana dekhne main koi bhi party peeche nahin rahanaa chaahati he

 Their identity is neither clear nor it is known what their motive is
 ye aise khatre hai jo un logon ke bich bhranti failaate hai jinhen paaramparik or nishchit maahaul surakshit or suhaavna lagata he
 The inconsistencies also threaten and show possibilities and can be uncertain in this strange role
 iskaa udhaaharan aam aadmi party (aap) jaise sanghathan main khaas taur par dekha ja saktaa he
 You are an inconsistency among political parties
 yah party jaisi lagati he, lekin akasar virodh karne vaale andolan kii tarah vyavhaar karti he or kabhi-kabhi apana virodh karke bhi santusht ho jaati he
 In today's era, no party has attracted so much attention nor caused so much disappointment
 aap kaa udai shuru se hi andeh ke ghere main tha
 This party, born of Anna Hazare's movement, started in a form of resentment
 us samay kejariwal anna ke sanathan sahaayak najar aate the
 When Kejriwal decided to leave the path of agitation and form a political party to contest elections, a lot of anger was left behind
 unki chhavi aise nayak ke rup main ubhari jisane anna se unki jwaala chin lee thi
 The formation of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came to be regarded as a symbol of defiance of order
 baad main un par jo arajak hone kaa thappa laga vah asal main aap ke gathan ke myth se hi upja tha
 As a staircase of chaos, it is important to see yourself in its context
 kuch aalochak yah bhi kahenge ki aap asal main kuch logon ke ahan kaa prakkathan bhi thi
 The Aam Aadmi Party was actually a symbol of the encounter of ideas and some new style
 ye media kii chaheti party thi jisaki khabaren dinabhar chhaayi rahati thi
 These news were liked by the public and you became a new thinking leader and an enthusiastic bunch of active supporters
 isane muskaraate hue pratirodh kii raajnneeti ko janm diya
 The same feeling of disarray was felt by Aam Aadmi Party's victory in Delhi and Kejriwal becoming Chief Minister
 logon ko richard senet kii mashhoor pustak da ujes of dysorder kii yaad aa gai
 Sennett was an amazing sociologist and jazz musician who recognized the pulse of politics
 unhone siddh kiya ki avyavashtha se nai khoj kii shakti, asantosh, nae vichaar or bahes ke nae andaaj panpate hai jinaki anushaasit vyavastha main koi gunjaaish nahin he
 You adopted the policy of using chaos
 pehle kuch hafton main sachivalay main aap ke khule darbaron main khub udham hua
 The middle-class pranks mocked it as a novice thinking of power and responsibility
 kejariwal ne intjaam kii is chook ke liye bade lubhaavne andaaj main maafee maang lee
 Still people did not get angry with this noise or trouble
 unhen laga ki sarkaar ne sunne kii mashin pahan lee he
 People hoped that the situation of electricity and water would be better
 lekin aap aise kaam karne lagi jise niyamit prashasan kii bajaae udwelit virodh pradarshnon se zyada moh he
 You could not understand the difference between guard and protest
 usase bhi bura yah hua ki madhu kishwar ne yah chetavanee dete hue istipha de diya ki aam aadmi party ne mahilaon ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 This showed that the party could not handle women's participation properly
 africa nivaasiyon kaa mudda ho yaa khap kaa sawaal, party in muddon kaa koi santoshjanak jawaab nahin de pai
 By then, the aap's biggest supporter media had started turning away from him
 mukhyamantri pad se kejariwal ke istife ne apekshaaon kaa taratamya bhang kar diya
 There was no sense in this decision and it was taken abruptly
 aisa laga ki aap samaj nahin pai ki chune jane kaa matlab satta kaa sanchaalan karnaa hota he
 This time Kejriwal did not even talk to his people
 aisa laga ki kejariwal ne us mukhute ke liye janata naam kaa kapol paatr gadha tha jisaki unhen behad jarurat thi
 Supporters began to feel betrayed
 aisa laga maano unhone sanak main faisla kar liya ki mukhyamantri nahin rahanaa he or ek andolankaaree ke rup main apni bhoomika se ve zyada santusht najar aae
 Bemja Nautanki, Beshaur Rajneetiyeh, will have to admit that seeing the election coming closer, you cleverly changed the maneuver
 dilli kaa prashasan bhuulakar sara dhyaan vibhinn naatakeey andolanon par laga diya gaya
 The idiom of Ram and Ravana seemed appropriate, but Ram's arrows had no effect on Narendra Modi, who was promoted as Ravana
 varanasi kaa yuddh kai tarah se mayavi rahaa, lekin kejariwal samaj gaye ki dilli chhodkar bhaagane ke liye janata ne unhen maaf nahin kiya
 The drama of leaving one battle to enter another war was a symbol of bad and even worse politics
 logon ko laga ki kejariwal ko chunane me jo urja unhone kharch kii thi use itani aasaani se ganvaa diya gaya
 When the AAP started pretending to campaign, the party forgot the trusteeship of power
 lekin raaj-paat chhodie kii yah chaal uske samarthakon ko baichaiyn karti rahi
 No matter how strong the bjp's election campaign has been, the Aam Aadmi Party's unique campaigning caught the attention of the people
 sangrur main party ne nashe ke kaarobaar ko mudda banaakar usamen netaaon kii bhagidaari ujagar kar di
 During the campaign in Kudankulam, opposition to the nuclear plant was resorted to, although by then the second reactor was getting ready
 amethi main kumaar vishwaas ke tevar ne jang kaa rukh tay kar diya
 He laid the foundation of Smriti Irani's campaign by opening the way to politics of possibility in Amethi
 vishwaas kii prachaar niti par press ke hamalon kaa koi asar nahin tha
 His honesty about the press propaganda that consistently described him as a poet, clown and prankster was not fully understood
 kejariwal ke prachaar ne bhi modi kii lokapriyata ke naatak par aghat kiya or jaahir kar diya ki raajnneeti main vikalp kii sambhaavnaaen bharat ko aakarshith karti hai
 It was also felt that your future was dependent on the electoral gap
 chunaav ke nattejey kai partiyon kaa dil todgaye vaale sabit hue
 The AAP helped create an atmosphere to defeat the Congress, but the election results were considered a vote in support of the BJP
 agar ankon ko faisle kaa paimaana maane to bharat ne bijepi ke liye vot kiya tha
 One observer said while comforting that you may have lost millions in bail, but Goodwill has won a lot
 ankon ke khel kaa asar beraham tha
 Vishwas and Kejriwal lost by a huge margin
 aap ke netritv kii jameen hilti najar ai
 The party in power took the results so seriously that it did not even have the zeal to celebrate the unprecedented victory in four seats in Punjab
 yah to maananaa padegaa ki chunaav ke nattejey haarane vaali partiyon ke liye hameshaa dukhad hote hai
 History stops counting and the media favorite soon falls into the margins of silence
 aam taur par partiyaan haar ke baad chaati petakar matam manaati hai or haar kaa thikra phodde ke liye koi sir talashti hai
 Resignations spread like epidemics
 aam aadmi party main bhi yahi hua
 Shazia Ilmi, Anjali Damania and Captain Gopinath resigned
 aisa laga ki captain gopinath ke liye kam kharch kii raajnneeti chalaanaa kam kharch kii airlines chalaane se zyada mushkil tha
 The last blow was made by Yogendra Yadav by resigning from party committees and alleging lack of internal democracy
 lekin abhi yah spasht nahin he ki yadav ne aisa kyon kiya
 The reason for this was the quest for democracy, was Kejriwal's challenge to power or was it a furore over the election results? Suddenly, it seemed that the Aam Aadmi Party, like any other party, needed an excuse to overcome the shocking results of the election
 us samay kejariwal bhi baukhala gaye or achaanak phir dilli main sarkaar banane main dilchaspee dikhaane lage
 Announced to go to the public
 yah faisle kii chook thi kyonki is maukey par naitikta or sujh-boojh kii jarurat thi
 For the restless Kejriwal, the public could not be the medium to play the game
 sankat mitaa, samasya barilekin aap kii khubi hameshaa se uske samarthakon kii vafadari or shakti main he
 There are two layers of AAP supporters
 sabase bahari parat un prashansakon or aam logon kii he jo aap ko ummid kii najar se dekhte hai
 The second layer is that of countless activists who have given hope, honesty and new thinking the color of AAP politics
 unhone hameshaa aakraamak tevar dikhaae lekin hameshaa sahi sabit hue, aap ke liye bahes kii par ahm par kaabo rakhaa
 The self-reliance and self-discipline he showed was respected
 aisa bhi lagata he ki aap ke paas samajhadaar logon kaa ek anaupchaarik samooh tha jo mamata or chintaa ke saath aap par najar rakhata tha
 People like retired Admiral Ramdas, Lalitha Ramdas and Kamal Mitra Chinoy, each of whom has his own mature thinking about politics
 unhone aap ke trustee kii tarah chupchaap kaam kiya or uski khaamiyon kaa akalmandi se dhanka
 They knew that the journey of Swaraj will not be easy
 unhone mil-julkar ise maujuuda sankat se baahar dhakelne or ubaarane ke liye kaam kiya
 He continued to be the trustee of the party, healing wounds, caressing Aham and reminding him of future responsibilities in times of crisis
 unke snehil haath ne aap ko jhenpate hue or ghayal avasthaa main hi sahi waapas raajnneeti kii kushti ke ek or daur ke liye khadaa kar diya
 You have the right to these two layers more than Manish Sisodia or Yadav or Kejriwal, who have kept it alive
 aap kaa sankat to philhal tal gaya he lekin samasyaayein khatm nahin hui hai
 For one thing, it has started to imprint to some extent that it is not different from other parties
 aap ko satta ko trustiship maanane kaa apana sankalp doharaana hoga
 He has to honestly tell the public how the crisis is and how to get rid of it
 duusare shashaktikaran kaa vaada janata ke baad apane samarthako se bhi karnaa hoga
 Both his loyalists and critics need a new role in the upcoming debates
 apni raajnneeti ko nae sire se gande ke liye aap ko itihaas or nai khoj donon kii jarurat he
 Politics is never a game of hollow promises or repeating old stories on different issues
 aap ko raajnneeti par baari maun toduya hoga
 Kejriwal's declaration of Swaraj will have to be given a more concrete form and move beyond the purview of the manifesto to a book or collection of actual events
 aap ke netritv ko uske maujuuda nadirshahi tilism ko toduya hoga or loktantr ko shashaktikaran kaa hathiyaar bananaa hoga
 If this did not happen, countless hopes would be broken
 agar usne nae dhang se or vinamrata se nae bhavishya ke liye kaam kiya to itihaas uskaa ehsaan maanegaa kyonki bhavishya hi party, kalpana or avishkaar ke rup main aam aadmi party kii asli puunji he

 The condition of Pakistani economy is very bad
 haal yah he ki vahaan ab china bhi apana nivesh ghataane laga he, jo pakistan ke liye bada jhatka he
 Experts say that this is why Pakistan is trying to do some audacity on the border so that the attention of its public can be removed from the crisis of the economy
 gauratlab he ki china ko abhi tak pakistan kaa aisa sadabahaar dost mana jaataa rahaa he, jo har mushkil main uske saath khadaa rahata he
 Before the World Bank got help, China invested billions of dollars to manage the Pakistani economy
 nakadi sankat se jujh rahe pakistan ko bachaane ke liye is saal march main china ne use do arab dollar kaa karj diya tha
 But now the bad news for Pakistan is that China has started pulling its hand from there
 vitt varsh 2018-19 ke chah maheenon, july se june, ke dauraan pakistan main chini nivesh ghatakar 49
 6 million dollars, while China in Pakistan in the same period a year earlier
 8 arab dollar kaa nivesh kiya tha
 Investment of America also decreased likewise, the investment coming from America during this period decreased to 8
 4 karod dollar rah gaya
 a year ago during this period, the United States made 14 in Pakistan
 70 karod dollar kaa nivesh kiya tha
 According to Economic Times, foreign investors are concerned about the economic environment of Pakistan
 vitt varsh 2018-19 ke pehle 11 maheenon main pakistan main aane vaale pratyaksh videshi nivesh (FDI) main 49 fisadi kii baari giravat ai he
 Total 9 to Pakistan in FY 2018-19
 5 arab dollar kaa videshi karj mila tha, jo uske saalaan lakshya 9
 Is over 3 billion dollars
 iske alaava saudi arab or sanyukt arab emirate (UAE) se mila 5 arab dollar kaa karj bhi mila he jise pakistan ke kendriya bank state bank of pakistan ke bahikhaate main darj kiya jaataa he
 Growth rate of Pakistani economy in FY 2018-19 is just 3
 29 fisadi rahi he
 There has been a billion-dollar investment in CPEC
 When the CPEC project started in 2013, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and the then President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari agreed to build an economic corridor between the two countries
 2014 main jab pakistan ke tatkaaleen raashtrapati mamanun hossain or pradhanmantri navaj sharif ne kai baar china kaa daura kiya to yah pariyojna jameen par aane lagi
 In November 2014, the Chinese government announced that it would provide $ 46 billion in financial assistance under the CPEC in energy and infrastructure projects
 sitambar 2016 main china ne elaan kiya ki sipiisi ke liye 51
 a new agreement of $ 6 billion has been reached
 november 2016 main sipiisi kii kuch yojanaayen shuru ho gai or china se trek bharkar saamaan pakistan ke bandargah guadar par aane lage

 The dates for the Gujarat assembly elections have been announced
 gujarat ke siyaasi ranbhumi main congress or bijepi ke bich talavaarein khich chuki hai
 For the sixth time in a row, the BJP has been struggling to hold the power of the state
 congress jatiy sameekaran ke jariye 22 saal ke satta ke vanvaas ko todna chaahati he
 Will the caste card in Gujarat be a Sanjeevani for the Congress or will it be known only on December 18? rajya main 146 jatiyaan obisi kii category main aati hai
 Apart from this, 16 percent of the Patidar community (belongs to the general caste) are called kingmakers of Gujarat
 gujarat main 7 fisadi dalit, 11 fisadi adivasee, 9 fisadi muslim or 5 fisadi main saamaanya jati ke brahman, baniyaa or anya jatiyaan shaamil hai
 The most difficult thing for the congress-bjp on the caste formula of Bihar is that it does not like caste politics
 bihar kaa vidhansabha chunaav iskaa udaahaaran he
 RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav had demolished the BJP by shuffling the caste elections around the caste
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi bihar ke jati sameekaran ke formule ko gujarat ke siyaasi ran main ajamaane utre hai
 Congress's OBC Card Congress in Gujarat has created a caste formula to win the battle of Gujarat
 gujarat ke obisi samudayako saadhane ke liye congress ne pehle rajya ke prabharee kii kaman obisi samudaay se taalluk rakhane vaale ashok gahalot ko di
 Gehlot is from Saini community and he is from Padhosi Pradesh Rajasthan
 saini samudaay kii acchhee khaasi aabaadi gujarat main bhi he
 Apart from this, he gave the command of the state president to Bharat Singh Solanki of the OBC community
 obisi ke yuva cheharaa maane jane vaale alpesh thakor ko bhi rahul gandhi ne gale laga liya he
 Apart from this, efforts are being made to connect Hardik Patel to connect Patidar and Jignesh Mevani with the Congress to seek Dalit votes
 puraane nakshekadam par congressgujrat kii siyasat main congress pehali baar jatiy sameekaran ke sahare nahin utar rahi he
 Even before this, the Congress has been occupying the throne of power in Gujarat by formulating the formula of caste equation
 1985 main bhi congress is formulon ko apanaakar chunavi jeet hasil kar chuki he
 But when the OBC community was given reservation in Gujarat, the Patidar community parted ways with the Congress
 iske baad congress ke purv mukhyamantri madhav singh solanki ne siyaasi formula banaaya tha, jisamen gujarat ke obisi, muslim, dalit or adivasee shaamil the
 The alliance of these castes led to a historic victory in Gujarat
 lekin vakt or halaat aise bane ki congress ke is formule main bijepi ne sendhamari karke satta chin liya
 bjp's caste equations have staggered after Modi and Kovind Prime Minister Narendra Modi became the country's PM from the CM of Gujarat in 2014
 yahi vajah he ki congress apane puraane jati formule par lautati najar aa rahi he
 But it is not easy for him to set a political formula
 bataa den ki pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi pichde samudaay se aate hai
 BJP is also engaged in cashing Modi's OBC card
 iske alaava haal hi main raashtrapati bane ramnath kovind kii jati coli samudaay ko bhi bijepi apane paale main laane kii jugat main he jo ki gujarat main obisi samudaay main aata he
 Cultivating the obc-patidar together The Congress is working hard to get both the OBC and the Patidar together in Gujarat
 donon ko ek saath laana congress ke liye aasaan nahin he
 However, the BJP put together the OBC and the Patidar in the name of Hindutva
 par congress unhen jati ke naam par ek saath laane kii kavayad kar rah he, jo congress ke liye musiibat kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 If the Congress agrees to the conditions of the Patidar community, then the risk of obcs eroding will increase
 congress aise main congress 52 fisadi obisi ko naaraaz karne kaa jokhim nahin uthayega
 Because at the time when the demand for Patel reservation was raised, the OBC community also raised the voice against the demand of the Patidars
 aise main congress ke liye gujarat main jatiy sameekaran sanjivani banegaa yaa phir musiibat kaa sabab? isapar sabaki nigaah hogi
