 He raised the question and said that as a Congress leader i accept it but will any BJP leader accept it in such a way that they have made mistakes

 Scindia avoided these things and said that if we start telling it, it will take many hours
 unhone yah bhi poocha ki bijepi main wo koun log hai jinhone galtiyaan sweekaar kin
 Scindia said that the Congress learns from mistakes and it is due to this that the party has got success in all the three states
 sindhiya ne kaha ki bijepi ke jo vaahak hai vah aage kii taraf nahin dekhte hai vah keval rier vyuu main dekhte hai
 He said that BJP leaders only make allegations
 unka kahana hota he ki 70 saal main kuch nahin kiya gaya
 But run away from discussing an issue
 rafel kaa sawaal uthaate hue unhone kaha ki agar bhaajapa ko lagata he ki isamen koi ghotaalaa yaa gadabadi nahin kii gai he to wo isaki jaanch jepisi se karaane ko taiyaar kyon nahin hote
 If the BJP feels that everything is fine then it should be investigated

 To this, Scindia said that we do not talk of annihilating anyone
 prajatantr main vipaksh nahin ek majboot vipaksh kaa hona jaruri he
 Differences arise from differences
 sindhiya ne kaha ki ham jite hai lekin bahut baariki se
 Scindia made a big difference between the BJP of 1994-96 and the BJP of today
 unhone kaha ki bajpeyi insaan the, aaj bhi kootneetigyon kii jarurat nahin he aaj achche insaanon kii jarurat he
 On whether the election year is coming, whether the charge will increase the phase of counter-attack, Scindia said that it is the job of the opposition to highlight the shortcomings of the ruling party
 vipaksh ko aarope lagane ke saath samaadhaan bhi bataanaa chahie
 On pm's question, Scindia said that Rahul Gandhi should become the PM of the country
 haalanki unhone kaha ki yah unka vyaktigat mat he

 The priest of the Ram Janmabhoomi temple, Satyendra Das, first came to pay homage to Hashim, who has been advocating the mosque for 65 years, and was followed by Mahant Gyandas of Hanumangarhi
 hashim apane jis bete ko is maamle kii pairvi karne kii vasiyat karke gaye hai, uskaa kahana he ki vah adaalat ke baahar aapasi samjhauta chahta he
 Hashim fought for 65 years
 ladate-ladate so gaye, lekin ladaai benatija rahi
 In his last days he wanted a compromise in which both the temple and the mosque should be built
 pichley dinon unhone kaha tha, 'ab hamase dekha nahin jaataa he ki ramalala tent main rahen
 Outside the court, only a method of compromise has to be found
 ' In the Hashim temple-mosque case, he has bequeathed the name of his son Iqbal
 ikbaal ab use aage badhayenge
 Iqbal says, 'well the matter is going on with the reconciliation
 
 
 jisamen ki hindu-musalmaan kaa sauhaard bana rahe
 This decision should be such that it suits hindu-muslim
 
 There should be no fight
 yahi inaki khwaahish he
 
 
 We will do the same thing
 ' Hashim was illiterate
 ek garib or bahut maamuli darji
 Many people became big men after the politics of Babri Masjid, but Hashim's son still adds puncture
 jis shaks ne 65 saal masjid kii ladaai ladi uski maut kii khabar sun sabase pehle pahunche ram janmabhumi mandir ke pujari satyendra das pahunche or unke baad hanumangadhi ke mahant
 Satyendra Das says that 'it is a great thing that Hashim, who had advocated for the mosque, also talked about building a temple
 ' Hashim has been trying to reach agreement with the Mahant Gyandas of Hanumangarhi outside the court for some time
 gyaandas bejaan hashim ko dekh ruaanse ho gaye
 Gyandas said, 'it was the effort of both of us to get the matter resolved in our lives, but what is acceptable to God
 'tippaniyan Hashim's locality looked like a revenge today
 hashim kii jindagi main bhale unki gali saaf na hoti ho, lekin maut ke baad chamak rahi he
 Ruins-ruins are being sprinkled with lime, as the wazirs of the government are coming to present them with khiraj-e-adiqat
 
 
 unki hifaazat ke liye bahut police lagi he
 His son's puncture shop at the turn of the street is closed today
 viklang anil apni tipahiyaa gaadi se unke janaaje main shaamil hone pahunche hai
 Anil says, 'his religion was different
 
 
 masjid ke liye lard rahe the, lekin sampradayik nahin the
 That is why people respect him
 ' Hashim was illiterate
 
 
 unhone kabhi taarikh nahin padhi thi, lekin vah khud taarikh kaa hissaa ban gaye

 The Congress has opened the door for youth to join politics

 congress kii navaniyukt mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ne saat samandar paar se bada daanv chalaa he
 According to sources, Priyanka has called a dozen leaders of the Congress of Uttar Pradesh from the United States to seek her blessings, support and guidance
 bataa den ki priyanka apni beti ke ilaaj ke liye in dinon america main hai
 Interestingly, these close to a dozen leaders are now either politically marginalized or are in the last stages of their age and are isolated in the party itself
 khaas baat ye he ki inamen se kuch to aaj ke daur main kisi party se taalluk bhi nahin rakhte
 Priyanka has tried to show political nobility by calling them, and has also made efforts to connect more and more people
 priyanka bhi jaanati hai ki pehle kaaryakartaaon or netaaon main josh bharkar hi wo janata ke bich majboot pakad bana sakati hai
 That is why even before returning to the country, Priyanka has run the first bet of her political box
 party netaaon ko priyanka se hai ummidenuttar pradesh main congress ke netaa priyanka gandhi ko lekar kehete the, wo aane vaali hai or chaane vaali hai
 Party leaders see the image of former Prime Minister and her grandmother Indira Gandhi in Priyanka Gandhi
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne apni bahan priyanka ko sakriy raajnneeti main utarkar loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bada daanv chalaa
 He gave Priyanka the charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh

 In UP, the Congress has become increasingly weak
 1989 ke baad se wo rajya kii satta se baahar he
 In such a situation, Gorakhpur, the stronghold of Prime Minister Modi's Varanasi and the Chief Minister of the state, Yogi Adityanath, is also in the same eastern UP, whose responsibility has been put by Rahul on Priyanka's shoulders
 aise main priyanka nai peedi ke saath hi upi main congress kaa svarnim yug dekh chuke netaaon ko bhi saath jodakar majboot chunauti dene kii taiyaari main hai
 Through this, Priyanka wants to hit two targets with one stone
 ek to puraane netaaon ke anubhav kaa phayda le saken or doosraa congress ke svarnim yug ko nai peedi kii janata ke bich jeevant kar saken
 Well, Priyanka's real challenge will be on the political plane from behind the scenes, where it will be known whether her bets are arrows or just pukes

 The Kochi Metro is inaugurated on Saturday, but in the invitation letter sent for it, when people did not show the name of e Sreedharan, who is called the 'metro Man' of the country, in the guests who were present with the PM on the platform, then controversy arose

 The Pinari Vijayan government of Kerala wrote a letter to the Prime Minister's Office, stating that the list of staged guests should be changed and many other names like Sreedharan could be included in it
 gauratlab he ki dilli metro sahit desh ke kai rajyon main metro ke nirmaan main ahm bhoomika rahi he
 Sources say, 'there is indeed a strong possibility that Sreedharan may be made the ruling BJP-NDA candidate for the presidential election on July 17
 isliye unka ummidavaari kii is ghoshnaa se kuch din pehle piem modi or kendriya mantri em venkaiya naidu ke saath manch par baithna uchit nahin hota
 Apart from this, PM Modi himself would like to keep a distance from such a person at public level, which NDA wants to pursue as President candidate
 'sutron kaa to yah bhi kahana he ki shridharan ne khud is par isliye aapatti nahin kii, kyonki unhen iske bare main bataaya ja chukaa he
 Now it will be seen that if indeed the BJP has put forward the name of Sreedharan for the President, then what strategy will the opposition parties adopt, because it will not be easy for them to oppose Sreedharan

 At the conclusion of the Congress padyatra, Sonia Gandhi said that some people today want to make RSS a symbol of the country, but this is not possible

 Addressing Congress workers, Sonia Gandhi said that Mahatma Gandhi inspired the whole world to take the path of non-violence

 During the Zero Hour, BJP and Congress members, through two separate adjournment motions, demanded that the CAG in its report revealed serious financial disturbances in the organization of the Mahakumbh and construction of monuments during the BSP regime
 isliye is par sadan main charchaa honi chahie
 Assembly Speaker Mata Prasad Pandey, citing the rules, said that the first CAG report will go to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and it can be discussed in the House only after the PAC report is received

 However, BJP members remained adamant on their demand and the party's deputy leader Satish Mahana reiterated the demand for discussion saying that when the CAG report has been tabled in the House and news has been reported in the newspapers, the discussion There is no harm in getting it done
 unhone kaha ki kaig report main mahakumbh ke aayojan tathaa smarakon ke nirmaan main gambhir aniyamittaaon kaa ullekh he, isliye charchaa jaruri he
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mohammad Azam Khan lashed out at the BJP, saying that Mahakumbh's case is related to faith, but she wants to confuse the public

 This time the Congress members came up in front of the seat demanding discussion and started a ruckus

 Amid the uproar, the Speaker adjourned the house for another five minutes

 It is noteworthy that the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) has revealed in its report that there were deficiencies in the planning and management of the Maha Kumbh Mela held in Prayag last year, saying that the demand for funds from the central government was not genuine
 
 report main aankadon ke hawaale se kaha gaya he, 'bharat sarkaar se kii gai dhanrashi kii maang vaastavik nahin thi

 The noise of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is now getting colder
 ek baar phir se yuva bharat ne umradraj netaaon ko shashan karne ke liye chun liya he
 The India Today Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) of the elections from 1999 to 2019 analyzed the age data of mps and found that the age of our mps has been above 50 years for the last twenty years
 dhyaan dene laayak baat yah he ki bharat kii aadhi se zyaada aabaadi 28 saal se kam kii he
 When the DIU assessed the age of the recently elected mps, it became clear that the country's population is becoming young but not the country's leader
 2011 janaganana ke aankade bataate hai ki bharat kii 11 pratishat aabaadi kii aayu 25-30 saal he
 The 17th Lok Sabha had only 1 of this age
 5 pratishat saansad hai
 Statistics also show that more than 25 percent of the population falls in the age range of 25-40 but in the 17th Lok Sabha, only 12 percent of mps of this age are there
 jansankhya pyramid main upar kii taraf jate hue pataa chalata he ki jaise-jaise aayu kii shrenee badhati jaati he, us aayu ke saansadon kaa aankada bhi badhata jaataa he
 This means that the number of mps of older age is more than the number of mps of younger age
 is baar sabase zyaada saansad 51-55 saal kii umr ke chune gaye
 More than 16 percent of the mps fall under this age limit
 umradraj saansadon kii badhati sankhyaumradraj saansadon kii badhati sankhyapichley bees saal main umradraj saansadon kii sankhya bhi lagaataar badhati hui nazar aa rahi he
 The average age of mps in the 13th Lok Sabha (1999‚Äì2004) was about 52 years
 jab bharat ek nai shatabdi kii taraf kadam badha rahaa tha, tab uske saansadon kii ausat aayu sabase kam thi
 In 2004 also the average age of mps of India was 52 years
 2009 main yahi ausat aayu badhkar 54 ho gai
 In 2014, the average age of mps increased to 59 years
 saansadon kii ausat aayu badhane kaa yah silsilaa lagaataar teen chunaavon tak chalata rahaa or 2019 main isamen giravat darj kii gai, pichhali loksabhaa main ausat aayu ghatakar 55 saal rah gai
 But this average is still higher than in 1999‚Äì2009
 congress vaaki main he grand old partydhiu ne chunaav sampann hone se pehle ummidavaaron ke aankadon kii padtaal kii thi or yah paaya tha ki is baar diggaj partiyon ne yuvaaon ko mauka nahin diya
 Only 8 percent of the Bharatiya Janata Party candidates were under the age of 40
 bhaajapa ke saansadon kii ausat aayu 55 varsh thi
 The BJP won the most candidates, after the BJP, the country's second largest party Congress also did not offer any more good options
 puraane aankadon ke aankalan se pataa chalata he ki congress vaaki main 'grand old party' he
 From 1999 to 2019, the average age of Congress party mps in all Lok Sabhas has been more than BJP
 1999 main jahaan bhaajapa ke saansadon kii ausat aayu 49
 The average age of Congress mps was 7 years, 54
 8 varsh thi
 In 2004, the average age of Congress mps increased to 56 years
 vahi bhaajapa saansadon kii aayu badhkar 51 varsh ho gai
 Age of Congress mps reduced to 55 in 2009
 3 varsh ho gai
 But despite this, she remained above the bjp's average of 54 years
 2014 main congress or bhaajapa, donon party ke saansadon kii ausat aayu sabase zyaada thi
 While the average age of Congress mps was 64 years, the average age of BJP mps was 60 years
 saal 2019 tak aate hue donon partiyon ke saansadon kii ausat aayu ghatakar 57 (congress) or 55 (bhaajapa) saal ho gai, isliye ye saaf taur par kaha ja saktaa he ki naujavaanon ko tikat dene main sabhi partiyaan bachati rahi hai

 Murout village of Ratwara Panchayat of Alamnagar block was once a happy village, but due to continuous erosion during the last 10 years, the Kosi river has taken it almost to its limelight
 ratvaara gram panchayat kii mukhiya punam devi kahati hai ki is varsh ke bheeshan kataav ko dekhte hue lagata he ki kosi nadi puure gaanv ko nigal jaaegi
 Nearly 100 acres of fertile land of the villagers, a middle school and a Shiva temple have already merged into the river
 kareeb paanch hajaar aabaadi vaale murout gaanv ke log sab kuch chhodkar alamnagar murout maarg par sadak kinare asthai ashiana banaakar rah rahe hai
 People from about 10 houses are frozen in the village due to compulsion and attachment, but they too will soon leave the shelter
 sthaneey vidhayak or rajya ke yojana evam vikaas mantri narendra narayan yadav kehete hai ki is sthiti main fanse logon ko basane ke liye madad di jaaegi
 According to officials, to prevent erosion in the village, about Rs 11 crore has been spent for 10 years for anti-erosion work, but nothing has come out
 jiladhikari upendra kumaar ke anusaar sthiti par najar rakhi ja rahi he
 The affected villagers will be given regular compensation
 kumaar ne gaanv main jaakar logon se bhi baat kii or unhen madad kaa bharosa diya
 The economic condition of the people of the village has become miserable due to the breakdown of their land
 kuch log apni jameen khone ke kaaran asahaay hai
 Some economically capable people have made their homes
 gaanv ke ashutosh sharma bataate hai ki jinke ghar main kamaane yogya sadsy the ve kaam kii talash main baahar chale gayi he
 Some people live on their own by doing wages
 ashok das kehete hai ki jin logon ke paas maveshi the
 They make a lot of money by doing milk business, but it is difficult to run a family
 madhepura main kosi ke kataav ke kaaran kuch anya gaanvon kii bhi sthiti badahaal he
 Munaut village of Chausa block, Chhatowna Basa, Kapasia, Sukhadghat village of Alamnagar block also have their own story and pain
 abhi dedh saal pehle tak jis party kaa tikat vidhansabha chunaav main jeet kii guarantee mana ja rahaa tha, usee party ke tikat kaa loksabhaa chunaav se pehle lautaaya janaa, samaajawaadee party kii siyaasi sehat ke liye acha sanket to katai nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The situation is that Sompal Shastri in western UP and Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, MP in Eastern UP, have returned the party ticket, the party has had to change the 16 candidates announced so far
 darasal, bijepi ne jab se narendra modi ko apana pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaaya he, tabhi se uttar pradesh main arase se soi padi yah party achaanak sakriy dikhne lagi he
 If sources are to be believed, besides SP, about 38 mps from other parties are also engaged in getting tickets from BJP
 udhar, congress maan rahi he ki rashtriya raajnneeti main modi kii maujuudagi main musalmaan sapa kii bajaae use tarjeeh denge
 The SP had so far hoped that it would get the support of Muslim voters in the assembly (about 20 per cent) in the Lok Sabha as well
 lekin mujffarnagar dange ke baad se parade ke peeche chal rahi raajnneeti sataha par aa gai
 Returning the party ticket, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh said, "since 1947 bad conditions have happened in UP
 agar sapa sarkaar kahati he ki yah sab bijepi ne karaayaa he to sawaal yah he ki kya janata sapa ko isliye satta main laai thi ki akhilesh sarkaar haath par haath dhare baithi rahe
 In fact, Brij Bhushan has been in the BJP before and when he felt that the sp's stars should not go anywhere, he rejected the party ticket on seeing the opportunity
 pashchimi upi main 1998 main kaddavar jat netaa or kendriya naagarik uddyan mantri ajit singh ko bagpat se loksabhaa chunaav main haraa chuke, sompaal shastri ne party kaa tikat thukraa kar doosraa tagada jhtka diya
 Shastri's biggest worry was that the Muzaffarnagar riots created a rift in the ever-present jat-muslim unity of western UP
 ilaake ke jaaton main dangon ko lekar sapa sarkaar ke khilaaf khaasi naaraazgi he, udhar musalmaan bhi khush nahin hai
 In such a situation, leaving the SP to save the traditional vote, Shastri found a wise choice
 shastri kehete hai, ''sapa ke sheersh netaa jamini kaaryakartaaon se dur hote ja rahe hai, aisi sthitiyon main party se judaa rahanaa sambhav nahin he
 To address the changing equations, the SP included Imran Masood, the nephew of Muslim leader Rashid Masood of Saharanpur, and announced him as the new candidate in place of Feroze Aftab, a previously declared candidate from Saharanpur Lok Sabha constituency
 sapa main aakhir bhagdad kyon machi he? party ke pradesh pravaktaa rajendra choudhary kii daleel he , ''shastri or brijabhooshan singh ne tikat nahin lautaaya balki party ne inhen pehle hi suchit kar diya tha ki unka tikat kaata ja rahaa he
 "according to him, till now the tickets of 16 Lok Sabha candidates have been cut and can be cut even further
 ve narendra modi ke asar ko sire se khaarij karte hai
 Such rhetoric of leaders on the ruling party's ticket is increasing the restlessness of the SP
 purv or pashchim ke baad bundelkhand main bhi party mushkil main he
 The party had two out of four Lok Sabha seats here, but both had to cut tickets for sitting mps
 party ne jo sabase taaja tikat kaata he, vah jalon (surakshit) loksabhaa seat se saansad ghanashyam anuraagi kaa he

 If he cut the ticket for Singh Patel, he did not delay in catching the BSP
 udhar gajipur se apane maujuuda saansad radhemohan singh kaa tikat katkar sapa ne enarechaem ghotaale ke mukhya aaropee ke taur par jail main band babu singh kushvaha kii patni shivakanya kushvaha ko utarkar kushvaha voton par daanv lagaaya he
 The sp's national general secretary Naresh Agarwal argues, "up's Muslims know very well that no other leader can think of Mulayam Singh as much as he can
 ‚Äù lekin is daleel ke baavjood yah tathy chup nahin saktaa ki mujffarnagar dangon ke baad party ke sabase bade muslim chehre mohammad ajam khan ne hi khulkar saarvajanik naaraazgi jataai
 In the meantime, SP has started a new exercise to connect the most backward voters
 sapa rajya main do rath-yatraaen chalaa rahi he
 The aim is to weaken Mayawati's base by campaigning in favor of putting 17 extremely backward castes in the list of scheduled castes
 loksabhaa chunaav kii ladaai main utarane se pehle party ko yah sochna hi hoga ki mulaayam singh yadav kya is sthiti main honge ki modi or rahul gandhi kii tarah dhuandhar reliyaan kar saken? or kya akhilesh tab tak party ke kaddawaron ke bich dil se unke netaa ban paaenge? satta ke shikhar par hone ke baavjood apni hi jadon main ulajhati ja rahi sapa ko apane bheetar jhaank kar dekhnaa hoga ki kya 2014 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye uske paas vaaki koi ranneeti he bhi yaa nahin?

 srilanka ke captain kumaar sangakaara ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki bharat ne lig charan main kuch sharmnaak haar ke baavjood khud ko khitaab ko prabal daavedaar ke rup main pesh kar diya he or ab uske haathon lagaataar duusare final main haar se bachane ke liye unki team ko bahut khaas pradarshan karnaa hoga
 Sangakkara said at the press conference on the eve of the match, "india now looks fully prepared for the final and it has beaten us a lot on several occasions
 toss ke bare main sawaal kiye ja rahe he ki kya toss jeetne vaali team phaayde main rahegi
 i do not think so
 ‚Äôunhone kaha, ‚Äòyadi koi team lagaataar jeet darj karti he, to aapako use shrey dena chahie
 This means that he is ready to face such situations
 ham kai baar final khele hai or hamen kal jeet darj karne ke liye bahut khaas pradarshan karnaa hoga
 'india had lost to New Zealand by 200 runs in the first match, while in the eight-wicket defeat against Sri Lanka, they were dismissed for 103 runs
 aankade haalanki bharat ke paksh main hai, jisane june main asia cap final main srilanka ko haraakar khitaab jeeta tha
 Sangakkara said that his team watched the last league match between India and New Zealand
 unhone kaha, ‚Äòbharat ne bahut acha pradarshan kiya
 He took advantage of the situation and was successful in putting pressure on New Zealand
 hamane us match ko dekha tha or jab maidan par utrenge, to tamaam chizon par dhyaan rakhenge jaise ki unhone kaise gendbaaji kii, unki line kisi thi or kis tarah se unke gendbaajon ne akraman sambhala
 ' desh ke tamaam duusare baabaaon kii tarah daati maharaj bhi giraftaar ke dar se gaayab ho gaye hai
 Missing because he was to appear in front of Crime Branch in Delhi on Monday
 magar khud aane ke bajaae unhone apni vakil ko bhej diya
 After this action of Daati Maharaj, who escaped from questioning, the Crime Branch granted him only till Wednesday
 or agar buudhvaar tak daati krime branch ke saamne pesh nahin hue to unke khilaaf gairazmaanti warrant jari kar diya jayega
 The missing Dati Maharaj Dati Maharaj had said on Aaj Tak's camera that he would appear before the police on Monday
 lekin vaada kar daati maharaj gaayab ho gaye
 Now the waiting for the crime branch has become longer
 darasal, vakil ke zarie daati ne police se mohalat maangi he
 However, police have also warned to issue non-bailable warrants against them
 ab sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya do din baad daati maharaj police ke saamne aaenge?gairajamaanti warrant ho saktaa he jariastak ke camere par daati maharaj ne daawa or vaada donon kiya tha ki wo somvaar ko krime branch ke saamne hajir ho jaaenge
 But on Monday, Baba did not get any inkling of the whole day
 ulte apane vakil ko daati ne dilli ke krime branch ke daftar bhej diya
 But the crime branch has given a brief reply to his lawyer that if Dati Maharaj does not appear till Wednesday in the rape case, a non-bailable warrant will be issued against him
 giraftaar ke dar se gaayab hue daatiyani khud ko paak saaf or kanoon kaa paalan karne vaala bataane vaale balaatkaar ke aaropee daati maharaj ab giraftaar se bachane ke liye gaayab hai
 The police are raiding the bases of Dati Maharaj
 is puure maamle kaa nayaa twist ye he ki krime branch main pesh hone ke bajaae, daati maharaj ne ek audio clip jari kar di
 However, in this clip, Dati Maharaj appealed to his supporters to maintain peace
 audio clip jari kar kii apilandio main daati ne kaha ''main fakir hum, agar aap thodi si bhi mere se mohabbat karte hai to is tarah kii koi meeting mere naam par nahin karenge
 Milk of milk and water of water do justice, i believe in justice
 meraa aapse haath jodakar anurodh he ki mere cese main ulta pad jayega, agar aap is tarah kaa koi bhi kaam karenge to
 i humbly request you with folded hands not to do any such work
 bas prarthana karnaa jis satya kii raah par main chalaa hum wo safal ho or nyaay ho
 Any kind of sit-in demonstration and any kind of meeting or any kind of rhetoric is not good in the national interest
 raashtra naa asti hota he naa essi hota he, naa swarna hota he
 a nation is just a nation and there is no one greater than the nation
 ‚Äùvakil ne pesh hone ke liye maangi mohalatis audio clip ke saamne aane ke baad ye sawaal uth rahaa he ki raashtra or kanoon kii baat karne vaale daati maharaj agar bekasoor hai to wo krime branch ke saamne pesh kyon nahin ho rahe
 Meanwhile, those saying this are saying that since Dati Maharaj is an astrologer himself, he does not want to be arrested till the 19th due to the changing movements of the planets these days
 lihaaza unke vakil ne krime branch se buudhvaar yani 20 june tak kaa vakt maanga he
 Dati Maharaj, who interviewed all the media channels, including search warrants against Dati, has disappeared for the time being and has gone missing that the police did not even know
 ab wo search warrant lekar unhen idhar udhar dhundti phir rahi he
 On Thursday after giving interview to Aaj Tak, we again telephoned him on Sunday
 jisamen khud daati maharaj ne daawa kiya ki wo kahin bhaage nahin hai
 Then the question is why the police are not able to reach them
 shishyaa ke saath rape karne kaa aropadaati maharaj par apni hi shishyaa serep kaa sangeen ilzaamahe or peedita ne daati ke khilaaf is maamle ko 10 june ko dilli ke fatehpur beri thane main darj karaayaa tha
 Since then, police have been investigating the victim along with her ashrams to gather evidence against Daati
 peedita kaa aarope he ki daati maharaj ne do saal pehle dilli ke ashram main uskaa rape kiya tha or phir paali ke alavaas ashram main bhi uske saath balaatkaar hua
 During the investigation, the victim also showed the police the rooms where she was tortured
 peedit ladki isi ashram main rahaa karti thi
 He had written his studies while staying here
 daati maharaj philhal is ashram main nahin he

 As the heat of the Delhi elections rose, Kejriwal realized the importance of vote bank politics
 isi jarurat ne kejariwal ko ‚Äòittehad-e- millat council‚Äô (iemasi) ke rashtriya adhyaksh or musalamaanon main barelvi sampradaay ke moulana tawqir raja ke dar par khadaa kar diya
 Late in the evening of Friday, 1 November, Kejriwal took time out from his busy schedule to reach Hazrat Dargah Ala of Bareilly and met Maulana Tauqeer Raza
 moulana se kejariwal kii yah pehali mulaakaat thi
 In positive meeting, both of them praised each other strongly
 kejariwal ne moulana ko hindustan kii badi shakhsiyat bataaya to jawaab main moulana ne kaha ki kejariwal unhen behad pasand hai
 In fact, Sunni Muslim votes are the target behind this whole exercise
 moulana tawqir raja ne apni raajnneetik party bhale hi bana lee ho lekin abhi uski pahchaan bareli ke aasapaas ke ilaakon tak hi simit he
 Maulana Tauqeer Raza holds considerable sway among Sunni Muslims, being associated with the Dargah Ala Hazrat, known worldwide as the Markaz of Sunni Muslims
 musalamaanon kii yah birdari dilli main kaaphi badi sankhya main he
 The same thing has drawn Kejriwal to Bareilly

 Maulana had also returned the status of Minister of State
 samaajawaadee party ( sapa ) ke rashtriya adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ne moulana tawqir raja ko badi mushkil se manaakar sarkaar ke saath jude rahane ko manaaya tha
 Since the SP is not contesting the Assembly elections from Delhi, there is no way of making Maulana Tauqeer Raza join hands with Arvind Kejriwal

 Kejriwal is getting a lot of support from the educated and well-to-do sections of Delhi, but to win the election, his party also needs the support of Muslims, especially those living in Old Delhi
 in musalamaanon main bahumat sunni samudaay kaa he
 That is why Kejriwal, who has kept distance from other political parties and leaders so far, has made an important change in his strategy, taking the initiative to link Maulana with him

 Tej Pratap Yadav has started naming Mangal Pandey and calling him Amangal Pandey
 isaki vajah yah he ki mangal pandey pichley kuch hafton se bihar se gaayab rahe or himachal pradesh main pravaas kar rahe the

 Responding to the same tone of Mangal Pandey, on Friday, Tej Pratap Yadav wrote on Twitter that Mangal Pandey has denied the beauty of Bihar and that is why he visits Himachal Pradesh
 tejpratap yadav ne likhaa ki himachal pradesh ghoomane vaale mantri hai ‚Äúamangal pandey ji‚Äù
 By the evening, Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi also responded to such attack of Tej Pratap Yadav
 susheel modi ne kaha ki satta jane ke baad se tej pratap yadav jaise log hataash ho gaye hai or raajnneetik bahes ko nihaayat hi ghatiya or nijee str par laakar rajya ko sharmasaar kar rahe hai
 Regarding Tej Pratap, Modi said that he has neither a solid argument nor fact nor language has been taught to him

 The body of three children who had gone missing from Kurukshetra in Haryana was found in Morni forest in Panchkula
 police jaanch main jo pataa chalaa, wo to or bhi hairaan kar dene vaala tha
 It is revealed that all three children have been murdered by their uncle at the behest of their father
 pita apni premika se shaadi karnaa chahta tha, jisamen bachche baadhak ban rahe the
 According to the information, Sohan, the father of the deceased children, had a love affair with a woman from Himachal Pradesh
 donon shaadi karnaa chaahate the
 In such a situation, children were becoming a snag between them
 bacchon ko apni khushi main baadhak banataa dekh pita ne khaufnak plan banaaya
 He lured his cousin Jagdeep to murder the children by luring them money
 iske baad ravivaar kii subah jagadeep samir 11 varshiya samir, 8 varshiya simran or 4 varshiya samar ko lekar apane gaanv sarasa se car main lekar niklaa
 If anyone suspects, first the children were sent outside the village on foot
 car se mela dikhaane kii baat kahkar unhen morni hills le gaya
 It is being told that the three were shot and killed there
 is dauraan teenon bacchon ke naam par teen rail tikat kharide jane kii baat bhi saamne ai, lekin bachche train main savaar nahin hue the
 Photographer father Sohan, who was here by profession, left the house after asking him to go on a booking
 use parijanon ne bataaya ki bachche laapata hai, jis par vah kuch der baad ghar laut aayaa
 Started pretending to find children
 udhar, panchkula ke morni jangal main teen bacchon ke shav milane se hadakamp much gaya
 Police started investigation by taking all three bodies
 mritak bacchon kii shinaakht kurukshetra ke sarasa gaanv ke rahane vaale samir, simran or samar ke rup main kii gai
 After this, the police team reached Sarsa village
 vahaan vistrut jaanch ke baad vaardaat kaa pardaafash ho gaya
 Let's say that Sohan used to run a shop in Kaithal
 isi dauraan himachal pradesh kii rahane vaali ek mahila ke saath uskevaidh sambandhban gaye
 a few months ago, he had talked to his family members about marrying the woman, but after the house was in chaos, he carried out the conspiracy
 vah bacchon ke baad apni bivi se bhi peechha chhudaane kaa plan banaaya tha
 The day of October 27 was important for the enlightened section of Ujjain, the religious city of Madhya Pradesh
 is din vishwa prasiddh jyotirling mahakaleshwar kii puja-archana kii vidhi par ucchtam nyaayalay main sunwaayee hui
 The Supreme Court ruled that the consecration of the Bhootabhavana Mahakal would now take place from "RO Water"
 shivlinga ko ksharan se bachaane ke liye nyaayalay main daayar yachika par yah vyavastha di gai he
 According to this, a devotee can offer a maximum of half a liter of "RO water"
 ujjain kii sarika guru kii yachika par justise arun mishra or justise el
 On the proposal of the temple committee in the bench of Nageshwar Rao, the court also stamped that the quantity of milk or panchamrit would remain a maximum of one and a quarter liter
 yah bhi tay kiya gaya ki bhasmarti ke dauraan shivlinga ko sooti kapade se dhank diya jayega
 In Dwadash Jyotirlingas, there is a bhajmarti in Ujjain only at four in the morning, for which the ashes of the dung are prepared
 ucchtam nyaayalay main tay vyavastha ke bindu saarvajanik hone ke baad isko lekar vidwaanon main bahes bhi shuru ho gai
 The famous astrologer Pt
 aanandashankar vyas kehete hai, ''mahakaal kii pujan vidhi main parivartan shastrasammat nahin he, mandir kii pracheen pujan parampara main badlaav shankaraachaaryon se vimarsh ke baad hi kiya ja saktaa he
 "at the same time, Sarika Guru argues that the Shivalinga is being damaged by contaminated water and panchamrit
 shivlinga ko ksharan se bachaane ke liye anya jyotirlingon main bhi kuch upaay kiye gaye hai
 In Kedarnath, Mallikarjuna, Bhimashankar, Ghrishneshwar, Somnath, Omkareshwar and Trimbakeshwar, the offering of panchamrit to the Shivalinga of devotees is prohibited
 nageshwar or bhimashankar main jyotirling par chaandi kaa kavach dhakaa jaataa he jabaki rameswaram or somnath main shraddhaluon kaa garbhagrih main pravesh pratibandhit he
 The light cannot be touched in Kashi Vishwanath, but out of the 12 Jyotirlingas of the country, only Jalabhishek of Ujjain's Mahakal will be from "RO Water"
 yah mandir ke aaro plant se hi uplabdh karaayaa jayega
 Till now, Mahakal's Jalabhishek was done with the water stored in the Kotithirtha of the temple complex
 ucchtam nyaayalay ke nirdesh par visheshgyon kii ek samiti gathit kii gai thi jisamen bhu-vaigyanik or puratatvavid shaamil the
 The committee recommended limiting its quantity in view of the possibility of erosion from panchamrit
 pan
 Many scholars like Vyas believe that since time immemorial, Panchamrit has been anointed on Shivling, if there is a possibility of damage from adulterated material, then the temple management itself should provide pure ingredients like milk, honey, sugar, curd and ghee
 mandir prabandhan ne samiti ke sujhaavon par amal karte hue nyaayalay ko suchit kiya ki shakar ke sthaan par gud se bani khandasari kaa upyog panchamrita main kiya jayega
 Till now Shakar Bure used to be raped on Shivling, which would now be banned
 mandir prabandhan ne nyaayalay ko aashwast kiya ki shaam paanch baje baad sirf sukhi puja hi hogi, kisi ko jal nahin chadhaane diya jayega or usase pehle shivlinga tathaa garbhagrih kii nami ko pankhe aadi se sookhaaya jayega
 Even before that, watering was not allowed in the evening after grooming
 bhaang se shringaar jarur kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Concerns have been expressed in the past on Shivling caries and suggestions were made to enter the sanctum sanctorum and prohibit the touch of Shivling
 kaha gaya ki shraddhaluon ke haath kii garmi or paseene se shivlinga ko nuksaan pahunchataa he par is suzav ke virodhiyon ne tark diya ki mahakaal to shaktipunj hai or shraddhalu sparsh se unase urja hasil karte hai
 Therefore this suggestion was put on hold
 beete varshon main yahaan aane vaale shraddhaluon kii sankhya main badhotaree hui he
 It is the only Dakshinamukhi Jyotirlinga in the country, so it has great importance in tantra worship
 yah vishalkay jyotirling swayambhu he isliye bhi iskaa mahatv adhik he
 Whose government is it yah sawaal is sawaal se alag he ki sarkaar kiske liye hoti he
 Is it not the government whose party wins the election? darasal, yah koi mushkil sawaal nahin he
 Sometimes parties make this question difficult by giving childish arguments
 sarkaar party kii nahin hogi to kiski hogi
 Who is in the party or whose party is this can be a different question
 ham sab jaanate hai or bijepi bhi sweekaar karti he ki uske chunaav jeetne main aresas ke sanghathan or saadhaaran kaaryakartaaon kaa bada role hota he
 Sangh workers leave their homes and go to live in an electoral state for months
 bihar ke gaanv-gaanv main duusare rajyon se sangh ke kaaryakarta gaye hai
 The Sangh does not hide this work from the public
 uske saamne jaakar karata he
 It is another matter that the Sangh does not win anyone other than BJP
 to aap sangh or bijepi main kaise atanr karenge or kyon karenge
 When the pracharaks of the Sangh go from president to prime minister in BJP, it would not be easy to see this difference conveniently or ignore it
 mere hisaab se to aresas ko sarkaar ke har kaam kaa hisaab lenaa chahie
 Rather, there should be a mobile app between the government and the union, in which every decision comes before and after it is taken and the two get communicated in real time
 dilli main vasant kunj ilaake main hotel grand ke peeche madhya pradesh sarkaar kaa ek guest house he madhyanchal
 It is here that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has been seeking accounts from the BJP and Modi government ministers for the last two days
 bijepi ko lambey samay se cover karne vaale hamaare sahyogi akhilesh sharma ne apni report main likhaa he ki yahaan rashtriya swany sevak sangh or uske bhatru sanghathanon ke nabbe se adhik netaa mantriyon se kaam kaa hisaab le rahe hai
 The purpose of this meeting is not to allow the Modi government to deviate from the Sangh's agenda
 teen dinon tak sabhi bade mantri aakar apane vibhaag ke kaam kaa hisaab de rahe hai lekin is mahatvapurn samanvay baithak ko ram madhav ne saamaanya baithak kehete hai
 Do the ministers keep a line for three days in a general meeting and report their department
 pradhanmantri to mantriyon se hisaab lete hi he phir sangh pramukh or unke sahyogi sanghathan kyon hisaab le rahe hai
 Well, i am reading the names of only a few ministers
 vitt mantri arun jetali, videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj, raksha mantri manohar parrikar, parivahan mantri nitin gadakari, shahari vikaas mantri em venkaiya naidu, swasthya mantri je pi nadda, rasayan va urvarak mantri anant kumaar, calraj mishra, radha mohan sih, nirmala sitaraman
 The BJP President, the party's entire parliamentary board is also involved in this meeting
 ab is ati mahatvapurn baithak ko itnaa bhi saamaanya na kaha jaae ki aisa laga ki in sabake paas achaanak teen din kaa extra time batch gaya to sochaa ki kyon na aravali kii khubasurat vaadi main bane madhyanchal main chalakar madhyantar kaa lutf liya jaae
 It was said that socio-economic challenges are being discussed
 kya ye chunautiyaan itani bad gayi hai ki sangh ke solah sanghathanon ke saamne puri sarkaar ko haazir hona pade
 Is it not a good thing that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is taking accountability of the success and failure of the Union Government by taking account of the work from the ministers
 ab yah dekhnaa hoga ki jo sangh kaa agenda he wo bijepi ke vijan dacument yaa chunavi ghoshnaptr main he yaa nahin
 Should there be a distance between the agenda and the manifesto of the Sangh
 is baithak se aane vaali khabaren bhale hi sutron kii meharbaani kii dein hon magar akhilesh sharma ne bataaya ki sangh ne media ke liye behatar intazaam kiye hai
 Even mosquitoes have been driven away by the fogging machine due to media awakening
 hamaara itnaa khyaal rakhane ke liye aresas kaa shukriya
 Those who call us good and bad by taking the name of RSS in social media, see how much RSS takes care of us
 akhilesh sharma ne kaha ki shaayad sangh yah jataane kaa prayaas kar rahaa he ki sarkaar uski he
 He is the boss
 sarkaar party or sangh ke sheersh netaaon ke bich haat line khuli rahati he isliye har samasya kaa samaadhaan nikaal liya jaataa he
 It is not like the Vajpayee era that there was tension all the time
 modi yug main aisa nahin he
 On one thing, Akhilesh feels that the way Amit Shah is training 15 lakh members to become activists, it seems that BJP will want to reduce dependence on the Sangh in the matter of elections
 lekin aresas, vishwa hindu parishad ke saamne sarkaar apana prajentation karen to lagata nahin ki ye nirbharta itani aasaani se khatm hone vaali he
 From this meeting it shows that the government is accountable to the union and is conscious about the accountability of the union government
 tisare din pradhanmantri aa sakate hai or ant main sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat bhaashan denge
 Now come to the opposition
 uskaa kya etraz he
 The Congress says that the government has no time to meet the soldiers sitting on the dharna for the One Rank One Passion
 kya sainik se zyada sangh mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 Congress leader Manish Tiwari said that it seems from this meeting that remote control is now being controlled from the front
 modi bhale hi pradhanmantri hon lekin baas bhagwat hai
 The government is a puppet of the Union
 ensipi netaa omar abdulla ne kaha ki kya is baithak ke baad bhi koi mujhase kahana chahega ki ye saamaajik sanghathan he
 Raghav Chadha of Aam Aadmi Party said that RSS is a constitutional body which the government is reporting
 isse chunaa hua sansadeey loktantr kamazor hua he
 Now you must have understood
 kahin ye iz ikval tu to nahin ho rahaa he
 In the era of Manmohan Singh government, the main charge of BJP was that Manmohan Singh is not the Prime Minister at all
 sarkaar to das janpath se chalati he
 The Manmohan government was called a remote government
 aap jaanate hai ki upie sarkaar main ek rashtriya salaahkaar samiti bani thi, NAC kii adhyaksha sonia gandhi thim
 It was a kind of cabinet post
 NAC kii website par likhaa hota tha ki hamaara kaam sarkaar ko input dena he taaki use saamaajik suraksha kii nitiyaan banane main madad mili
 Is the RSS not saying the same thing? ab main yah nahin kah rahaa ki congress main bhi ek aresas tha yaa aresas main bhi ek congress he
 Please do not follow me
 un dinon bijepi kaha karti thi ki NAC se pradhanmantri kaa pad kamazor hua jo ab modi ke aane ke baad majboot ho gaya he
 From the coordination meeting of the RSS, the Congress is hopeful that the Prime Minister's post like him has weakened or is happening
 yaad kiijie jab bijepi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar chunanaa tha
 If the Sangh had not come forward, there would have been a fight over the Prime Minister's candidature till date
 tippaniyan When his role can range from choosing a prime minister candidate to winning, why not ask what work is going on
 ye sawaal sunakar to bahut log khush ho gaye honge lekin is khushi main kahin yah sawaal miss na ho jaae ki kya vaaki koi aisa he jo pradhanmantri modi se hisaab maang le
 His ministers should give a presentation to someone other than him
 tab to chal kar dekhnaa hi chahie ki wo koun he
 We all know and BJP also accepts that RSS organizations and ordinary workers have a big role in winning its elections
 sangh ke kaaryakarta apana ghar baar chhod maheenon chunavi rajya main rahane chale jate hai
 Union workers from other states have gone to every village in Bihar
 sangh yah kaam janata se chipa kar nahin karata
 He does it in front of him
 ye or baat he ki sangh bijepi ke alaava kisi or ko nahin jeetaata he
 So how will you move between Sangh and BJP and why
 jab sangh ke prachaarak bijepi main adhyaksh se lekar pradhanmantri banate hai to is antar ko suvidhanusaar dekhnaa yaa nazarandaaz karnaa kya doharaapan nahin hoga
 According to me, the RSS should take account of everything the government does
 balki sarkaar or sangh ke bich ek mobile ap bhi hona chahie, jisamen har faisla lene ke pehle or lene ke baad aa jaae or donon ke bich real time main samvaad ho jaae
 Madhyanchal is a Madhya Pradesh government guest house behind Hotel Grand in Vasant Kunj area in Delhi
 yaheen par rashtriya swayan sevak sangh pichley do dinon se bijepi or modi sarkaar ke mantriyon se hisaab maang rahaa he
 Our long-time ally Akhilesh Sharma, who has covered the BJP, has written in his report that more than ninety leaders of the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh and its fraternal organizations are taking accounts from the ministers
 is baithak kaa makasad he ki modi sarkaar ko sangh ke agenda se bhatakane nahin diya jaae
 For three days, all the big ministers are coming and giving accounts of the work of their department, but this important coordination meeting is called by Ram Madhav as general meeting
 kya kisi saamaanya baithak main teen din tak mantri line lagaakar apane vibhaag kaa hisaab dete hai
 The Prime Minister is taking accounts from the Ministers, then why are the Union heads and their allied organizations taking accounts
 khayr main sirf kuch hi mantriyon ke naam pard rahaa hum
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, Urban Development Minister m Venkaiah Naidu, Health Minister JP Nadda, Chemicals and Fertilizers Minister Anant Kumar, Kalraj Mishra, Radha Mohan Singh, Nirmala Sitharaman
 bijepi adhyaksh, party kaa puraa sansadeey board bhi is baithak main shaamil he
 Now this very important meeting should not be called so common that it seemed that all of them suddenly had an extra time of three days, then thought why not walk in the mid-day in the beautiful valley of Aravali and enjoy the break
 kaha gaya ki saamaajik aarthik chunautiyon par charchaa ho rahi he
 Have these challenges increased so much that the entire government has to appear before the sixteen organizations of the Sangh
 kya yah acchhee baat nahin he ki mantriyon se kaam kaa hisaab lekar rashtriya swayan sevak sangh sarkaar kii kamyaabi or naakaami kii javabdehi le rahaa he
 Now it has to be seen whether the agenda of the Sangh is in the bjp's vision document or election manifesto
 kya sangh kaa agenda or ghoshnaptr ke bich duuri honi chahie
 The news coming from this meeting may be due to the kindness of the sources, but Akhilesh Sharma said that the Sangh has made better arrangements for the media
 yahaan tak ki media ke shaamiyane se bhi foging mashin se machharon ko bhagaaya gaya he
 Thank you RSS for taking such a care of us
 jo log soshal media main aresas kaa naam lekar hamen bhala bura kehete hai wo dekhen ki aresas hamaara kitna khyaal karata he
 Akhilesh Sharma said that perhaps the Sangh is trying to show that the government belongs to him
 wo bos he
 The hot line remains open between the government party and the top leaders of the Sangh, so every problem is resolved
 vaajapeyi yug kii tarah nahin he ki har vakt tanaav hi rahata tha
 This is not so in the Modi era
 ek baat par akhilesh ko lagata he ki jis tarah se amit shah 15 lakh sadasyon ko kaaryakarta banane kii training de rahe hai usase lagata he ki bijepi chunaav ke maamle main sangh par nirbharta kam karnaa chaahati hogi
 But if the government does its presentation in front of RSS and Vishwa Hindu Parishad, it does not seem that this dependency is going to end so easily
 is baithak se ye to dikhaa ki sarkaar sangh ke prati javabdeh he or sangh sarkaar kii javabdehi ko lekar sachet he
 On the third day, the Prime Minister can come and at the end Sangh Chief Mohan Bhagwat will give a speech ab aate hai ki vipaksh par
 What is his objection congress kaa kahana he ki van rank van peshan ke liye dharne par baithe sainikon se milane ke liye sarkaar ke paas vakt nahin he
 Has the union become more important than the military
 congress netaa manish tiwari ne kaha ki is baithak se yahi lagata he ki remot control ab saamne se control karne laga he
 Modi may be the Prime Minister but Bas Bhagwat
 sarkaar sangh kii kathputli he
 NCP leader Omar Abdullah said whether anyone would like to tell me after this meeting that it is a social organization
 aam aadmi party ke raghav chaddha ne kaha ki aresas kya sanvaidhanik sanstha he jise sarkaar report kar rahi he
 This has weakened the elected parliamentary democracy
 ab aap samaj gaye honge
 Is it going to be equal to this? manmohan singh sarkaar ke daur main bijepi kaa ye mukhya aarope tha ki manmohan singh to pradhanmantri he hi nahin
 The government operates from 10 Janpath
 manmohan sarkaar ko remote sarkaar kaha gaya
 You know that a National Advisory Committee was formed in the UPA Government, NAC was headed by Sonia Gandhi
 yah ek kism kaa cabinet pad tha
 It used to be written on the NAC website that our job is to give input to the government so that it will help in formulating social security policies
 kahin yahi baat aresas to nahin kahata he
 Now i am not saying that there was an RSS in the Congress or there is a Congress in the RSS as well
 pleez mere peeche mat pad jaaiyegaa
 In those days BJP used to say that the post of Prime Minister was weakened by NAC which has become stronger after Modi's arrival
 aresas kii samanvay baithak se congress ko ummid jaagi he ki unki tarah inke bhi pradhanmantri kaa pad kamazor hua he yaa ho rahaa he
 Remember when the BJP had to choose the prime ministerial candidate
 sangh aage nahin aata to aaj tak pradhanmantri kii ummdeevaar ko lekar jhagada chal rahaa hota
 The comments jab uski bhoomika pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar chunane se lekar, jitaane tak main ho sakati he to poochne main kyon na ho ki kya kaam ho rahaa he
 Many people would have been happy to hear these questions, but in this happiness, the question should not be missed whether there is really anyone who asks for an account from Prime Minister Modi
 unke mantri unke alaava kisi or ko prajentation de aayen
 Then one must walk and see who he is
 to aap sangh or bijepi main kaise atanr karenge or kyon karenge
 When the pracharaks of the Sangh go from president to prime minister in BJP, it would not be easy to see this difference conveniently or ignore it

 congress netaa manish tiwari ne kaha ki is baithak se yahi lagata he ki remot control ab saamne se control karne laga he
 Modi may be the Prime Minister but Bas Bhagwat
 sarkaar sangh kii kathputli he
 NCP leader Omar Abdullah said whether anyone would like to tell me after this meeting that it is a social organization
 aam aadmi party ke raghav chaddha ne kaha ki aresas kya sanvaidhanik sanstha he jise sarkaar report kar rahi he
 This has weakened the elected parliamentary democracy
 ab aap samaj gaye honge
 Is it going to be equal to this? manmohan singh sarkaar ke daur main bijepi kaa ye mukhya aarope tha ki manmohan singh to pradhanmantri he hi nahin
 The government operates from 10 Janpath
 manmohan sarkaar ko remote sarkaar kaha gaya
 You know that a National Advisory Committee was formed in the UPA Government, NAC was headed by Sonia Gandhi
 yah ek kism kaa cabinet pad tha
 It used to be written on the NAC website that our job is to give input to the government so that it will help in formulating social security policies
 kahin yahi baat aresas to nahin kahata he
 Now i am not saying that there was an RSS in the Congress or there is a Congress in the RSS as well
 pleez mere peeche mat pad jaaiyegaa
 In those days BJP used to say that the post of Prime Minister was weakened by NAC which has become stronger after Modi's arrival
 aresas kii samanvay baithak se congress ko ummid jaagi he ki unki tarah inke bhi pradhanmantri kaa pad kamazor hua he yaa ho rahaa he
 Remember when the BJP had to choose the prime ministerial candidate
 sangh aage nahin aata to aaj tak pradhanmantri kii ummdeevaar ko lekar jhagada chal rahaa hota
 The comments jab uski bhoomika pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar chunane se lekar, jitaane tak main ho sakati he to poochne main kyon na ho ki kya kaam ho rahaa he
 Many people would have been happy to hear these questions, but in this happiness, the question should not be missed whether there is really anyone who asks for an account from Prime Minister Modi
 unke mantri unke alaava kisi or ko prajentation de aayen
 Then one must walk and see who he is
 khayr main sirf kuch hi mantriyon ke naam pard rahaa hum
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, Urban Development Minister m Venkaiah Naidu, Health Minister JP Nadda, Chemicals and Fertilizers Minister Anant Kumar, Kalraj Mishra, Radha Mohan Singh, Nirmala Sitharaman
 bijepi adhyaksh, party kaa puraa sansadeey board bhi is baithak main shaamil he
 Now this very important meeting should not be called so common that it seemed that all of them suddenly had an extra time of three days, then thought why not walk in the mid-day in the beautiful valley of Aravali and enjoy the break
 kaha gaya ki saamaajik aarthik chunautiyon par charchaa ho rahi he
 Have these challenges increased so much that the entire government has to appear before the sixteen organizations of the Sangh
 kya yah acchhee baat nahin he ki mantriyon se kaam kaa hisaab lekar rashtriya swayan sevak sangh sarkaar kii kamyaabi or naakaami kii javabdehi le rahaa he
 Now it has to be seen whether the agenda of the Sangh is in the bjp's vision document or election manifesto
 kya sangh kaa agenda or ghoshnaptr ke bich duuri honi chahie
 The news coming from this meeting may be due to the kindness of the sources, but Akhilesh Sharma said that the Sangh has made better arrangements for the media
 yahaan tak ki media ke shaamiyane se bhi foging mashin se machharon ko bhagaaya gaya he
 Thank you RSS for taking such a care of us
 jo log soshal media main aresas kaa naam lekar hamen bhala bura kehete hai wo dekhen ki aresas hamaara kitna khyaal karata he
 Akhilesh Sharma said that perhaps the Sangh is trying to show that the government belongs to him
 wo bos he
 The hot line remains open between the government party and the top leaders of the Sangh, so every problem is resolved
 vaajapeyi yug kii tarah nahin he ki har vakt tanaav hi rahata tha
 This is not so in the Modi era
 ek baat par akhilesh ko lagata he ki jis tarah se amit shah 15 lakh sadasyon ko kaaryakarta banane kii training de rahe hai usase lagata he ki bijepi chunaav ke maamle main sangh par nirbharta kam karnaa chaahati hogi
 But if the government does its presentation in front of RSS and Vishwa Hindu Parishad, it does not seem that this dependency is going to end so easily
 is baithak se ye to dikhaa ki sarkaar sangh ke prati javabdeh he or sangh sarkaar kii javabdehi ko lekar sachet he
 On the third day, the Prime Minister can come and at the end Sangh Chief Mohan Bhagwat will give a speech ab aate hai ki vipaksh par
 What is his objection congress kaa kahana he ki van rank van peshan ke liye dharne par baithe sainikon se milane ke liye sarkaar ke paas vakt nahin he

 is baithak se aane vaali khabaren bhale hi sutron kii meharbaani kii dein hon magar akhilesh sharma ne bataaya ki sangh ne media ke liye behatar intazaam kiye hai
 Even mosquitoes have been driven away by the fogging machine due to media awakening
 hamaara itnaa khyaal rakhane ke liye aresas kaa shukriya
 Those who call us good and bad by taking the name of RSS in social media, see how much RSS takes care of us
 akhilesh sharma ne kaha ki shaayad sangh yah jataane kaa prayaas kar rahaa he ki sarkaar uski he
 He is the boss
 sarkaar party or sangh ke sheersh netaaon ke bich haat line khuli rahati he isliye har samasya kaa samaadhaan nikaal liya jaataa he
 It is not like the Vajpayee era that there was tension all the time
 modi yug main aisa nahin he
 On one thing, Akhilesh feels that the way Amit Shah is training 15 lakh members to become activists, it seems that BJP will want to reduce dependence on the Sangh in the matter of elections
 lekin aresas, vishwa hindu parishad ke saamne sarkaar apana prajentation karen to lagata nahin ki ye nirbharta itani aasaani se khatm hone vaali he
 From this meeting it shows that the government is accountable to the union and is conscious about the accountability of the union government
 tisare din pradhanmantri aa sakate hai or ant main sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat bhaashan denge
 Now come to the opposition
 uskaa kya etraz he
 The Congress says that the government has no time to meet the soldiers sitting on the dharna for the One Rank One Passion
 kya sainik se zyada sangh mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 Congress leader Manish Tiwari said that it seems from this meeting that remote control is now being controlled from the front
 modi bhale hi pradhanmantri hon lekin baas bhagwat hai
 The government is a puppet of the Union
 ensipi netaa omar abdulla ne kaha ki kya is baithak ke baad bhi koi mujhase kahana chahega ki ye saamaajik sanghathan he
 Raghav Chadha of Aam Aadmi Party said that RSS is a constitutional body which the government is reporting
 isse chunaa hua sansadeey loktantr kamazor hua he
 Now you must have understood
 kahin ye iz ikval tu to nahin ho rahaa he
 In the era of Manmohan Singh government, the main charge of BJP was that Manmohan Singh is not the Prime Minister at all
 sarkaar to das janpath se chalati he
 The Manmohan government was called a remote government
 aap jaanate hai ki upie sarkaar main ek rashtriya salaahkaar samiti bani thi, NAC kii adhyaksha sonia gandhi thim
 It was a kind of cabinet post
 NAC kii website par likhaa hota tha ki hamaara kaam sarkaar ko input dena he taaki use saamaajik suraksha kii nitiyaan banane main madad mili
 Isn't the RSS saying the same thing somewhere ? ab main yah nahin kah rahaa ki congress main bhi ek aresas tha yaa aresas main bhi ek congress he
 Please do not follow me
 un dinon bijepi kaha karti thi ki NAC se pradhanmantri kaa pad kamazor hua jo ab modi ke aane ke baad majboot ho gaya he
 From the coordination meeting of the RSS, the Congress is hopeful that the Prime Minister's post like him has weakened or is happening
 yaad kiijie jab bijepi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar chunanaa tha
 If the Sangh had not come forward, there would have been a fight over the Prime Minister's candidature till date
 tippaniyan When his role can range from choosing a prime minister candidate to winning, why not ask what work is going on
 ye sawaal sunakar to bahut log khush ho gaye honge lekin is khushi main kahin yah sawaal miss na ho jaae ki kya vaaki koi aisa he jo pradhanmantri modi se hisaab maang le
 His ministers should give a presentation to someone other than him
 tab to chal kar dekhnaa hi chahie ki wo koun he
 Akhilesh Sharma said that perhaps the Sangh is trying to show that the government belongs to him

 Many people would have been happy to hear these questions, but in this happiness, the question should not be missed whether there is really anyone who asks for an account from Prime Minister Modi

 com / qrofib5pvk Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dream is 10 lakh crores
 unhone jo 100 smart city banane kaa elaan kiya he, un par 150 arab dollar yani 10 lakh karod rupee kaa kharch aayega
 This estimate of cost has been made in a research and this study is done by research firm Deloy
 kahaan se aayega itnaa paisa?is study main to ummid jataai gai he ki yah rakam jutanaa itnaa mushkil bhi nahin he
 According to this, out of 150 billion dollars, more than 120 billion dollars or more than seven and a half lakh crore rupees will be arranged by private sector investment
 baaki rakam kaa intjaam france, america jaise deshon ke sahyog se kar hi liya jayega
 Efforts started to arrange, the government has started efforts to arrange this amount
 iske liye do program shuru kiye hai
 Smart City Mission: 7 through it
 5 arab dollar yani kareeb 49 hajaar karod rupee kaa shuruaati investment hoga
 Amrit Plan: Amrit i
e
 Atal Mission for Reservation of Urban Transformation
 isamen 500 shahar apgrade honge
 Challenges are no less: PN Sudarshan, Senior Director, Delhi India, said, "it is a matter of concern to arrange such a huge amount for a smart city
 lekin isse bhi badi chunauti smart city ke prabandhan, sarkari niti-nirmaan or uske niyaman kii he
 Expectations from investors say Heideloy's study says that in 2016, service providers and over-the-top content providers will invest heavily on wi-fi by cities

 unhone vartmaan filmon main mahilaon kii sthiti or filmon kii ruudhivaadee paramparaon ko lekar baatcheet kii
 Regarding the role of women growing up in films, Richa Chadha said that now the number of women-based films is increasing, because people are confident that women are also doing well at the box office
 vahiin vaani treepathi kaa kahana he ki ab bahut bada parivartan hua he or mahilaon ke ahm role vaali filmein aa rahi hai
 On the role of women, Anubhav Sinha said that films were made first, but the difference has been that the cinemas and films have also increased
 is anupaat main mahilaon ko lekar ban rahi filmein bhi bad rahi hai
 This change is happening constantly because of the change in the audience's thinking
 saath hi unhone kaha ki film kisi mahila yaa purush donon pradhan kii nahin honi chahie
 You do this by degrading women
 kabir kaa naam suna hoga, par kya jaanate hai arabi main iskaa matlab?filmon nirmaataaon kii pansad ko richa ne bataaya ki film gangs of vasepur karne ke baad unhen us tarah kii filmein mil rahi thi or bholi punjaban ke role ke baad unhen us tarah ke role milane lage
 Richa says, 'the producers wanted the same role
 bada badlaav ye he ki mahilaayein, jo diopi yaa film kru main hoti he, unki sankhya bhi bad rahi he or ab set par baraabar sankhya dikhti hai
 This big change has happened behind the scene
 'charchaa ke dauraan vaani treepathi ne kaha, 'jaise-jaise darshak kii ruchi badal rahi he, us hisaab se kathanak bhi badal rahe hai or cinema bhi badla rahaa he
 Earlier women were only shown as beautiful women, but now women are doing all kinds of roles
 parivartan aa rahaa he or har varg tak pahunch rahaa he
 'sahitya Aaj Tak:' They'll scream saffron-green, you stick to the tricolor 'on the comparison to actress Aishwarya Rai, Richa said,' She is a symbol of beauty, she has blue eyes and daughter-in-law of Amitabh Bachchan and a cute baby girl
 She is a mother
 lekin main ek abhinetri hum
 Aishwarya Rai also had many heroines in front of her and she too went ahead with many other films
 vahiin abhinav ne kaha ki cinema main kisi ko bhi duusare se nahin aankna chahie
 Every character has different importance in every scene
 film padmavat ko lekar vaani treepathi ne kaha, 'film main ek bhi cat bhi nahin lagaaya gaya or jitani di gai thi, utani length kii film paas kii gai thi
 Everyone knows about the rest of history
 ' vahiin anubhav ne kaha, 'padmavat main sirf raajnneeti kaa role tha
 Talking about the work of the censor board, Vani Tripathi said that if the portrayal of women is obscene, they will not pass the film
 is dauraan anubhav ne kaha ki agar puure niyam follow kiya jaae to film ban hi nahin sakati
 These rules were made earlier and it was only a few years when they were made
 guidelanis bahut zyada he or is baat honi chahie
 Richa said about the traditional stereotypes going on in films, "changes are happening nowadays
 vaise samaaj main jamini str par parivartan hona aavashyak he
 We are fighting at the time of publicity and Chintrakan
 ' vahiin vaani treepathi ne kaha, 'darasal jo dikhegaa wo bikega or jo bikega wo banegaa
 He also said that it is necessary to pay attention to what is happening with crew members other than the cast
 mitu campan par richa ne kaha, 'yah jarnalism, raajnneeti main har jagah hota he
 But there are many in Bollywood, they are just caught but not proved guilty
 wo yah lambey samay se aisa kar rahe hai
 It is said that Bollywood people do not come forward and what happens to those who come forward, their career was spoiled
 bollywood main kai aise nirmaataa hai, jinhen film banane main ruchi nahin he, balki ruchi main ruchi he
 'experience on item number said that item number is sexuality and it is a part of society and it is for that
 hero kii entry hamaare diene kaa hissaa he, jaise ramchandra ji aae the to un par kai pej likhe gaye the
 The same thing happens now
 vahiin richa ne kaha, 'pehle item number ke liye baahar se logon ko bulaayaa jaataa tha or ab abhinetriyaan khud kar hi leti hai

 Apart from this, the pace of adjustment in deposit and loan interest rates has increased with the change in policy rate in recent years
 ' Earlier, the IMF had also put forward the case that Indian banks are more vigilant in the monetary policy of the central bank
 is maamle main arabiai governor raghuram rajan samet kai logon ne kaha tha ki bank nitigat dar main katautee kaa phayda dene se bachate hai
 He said, 'there is anomalous evidence of monetary policy adjustment, banks adjust interest rates more rapidly at the time of tightening than the reduction in policy rate
 iske alaava haal ke saalon main nitigat dar main badlaav ke saath hi jamaa or rin byaaj daron main samaayojan kii gati badi he
 ' isse pehle bhi imef ne is maamle ko saamne rakhaa tha ki bhartiya bank, kendriya bank kii maudrik niti main sakhti par zyada teji se amal karte hai
 In this case, many people, including RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, had said that banks avoid giving benefits of policy rate cuts

 Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj gave a statement in the Lok Sabha on the revelations of 39 Indians missing in Aaj Tak
 loksabhaa main bolte hue sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki ye maamla bahut gambhir he
 He said that i will not speak this thing during the uproar, the whole country wants to hear the matter
 sushamaa boleen ki maine is maamle par rajyasabha main koi bayaan nahin diya he
 Sushma Swaraj said that i wanted to make a statement in Lok Sabha from the beginning
 ye ghatana hamaari sarkaar aane ke 20 din baad kii he
 At that time, Harjeet had said that i had killed 39 people in front of me, and i had escaped
 lekin hamen naa hi kahin laashen mili, naa hi koi suchi mili, or isliye ham kaise kah sakate hai
 There is a lot of contradiction in Harjeet's statement, the issue that was raised
 hamane mosul ke aas-paas talaashi lee he, maine jo kuch bhi kiya he vah sadan ko vishwaas main lekar kiya24 november 2014 ko maine kaha tha ki ek vyakti kah rahaa he ki wo maar die gaye hai, or 6 sutara kah rahe hai ki wo jinda hai to mujhe kya unhen dhundhna nahin chahie
 i had repeatedly told the House that i had no proof of his being alive, nor did i have any concrete evidence of his being killed
 main sadan kii anumati chaahuungi ki agar meraa rasta sahi he to ham isamen aage bad sake
 i was also given a statement for this
 teen saal se misalid karne kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 Cannot declare them dead without concrete evidence, it is a sin to do so, i will never commit this sin
 mujhe pataa laga ki isamen turki se madad mil sakati he, main khud turki gai thi baat karne kii
 The PM also spoke on this issue
 hamaare sutara aise vaise nahin hai hamen ek desh ke raashtrapati, ek desh ke videsh mantri ne ye bataaya he
 i have met the family of the victims 12 times, every time i said that i have no information about their survival, i am saying this by quoting sources
 unki file tab tak band nahin kar sakate hai jab tak koi saboot naa ho
 Sushma said that if i tell today that he has died but if someone is alive tomorrow, whom will he blame
 agar kisi parivaar vaale kaa mujh par se bharosa uth gaya he to ve aaazaad hai
 i never said that those people are in jail
 9 taarikh ko mosul aaazaad hone kii ghoshnaa kii gai, 10 taarikh ko hamaare videsh mantri mosul pahunch gaye the
 He stayed there for 4 days
 wike singh ke aane ke baad hi maine peediton ke parivaar ko bulaayaa
 VK Singh had said that those people were caught there, quoting from our sources, then they were kept in the hospital and then cultivated
 lekin 2016 ke baad se hamaara unase koi sampark nahin he
 We told the family what we found out
 sushamaa boleen ki tasviir bas itnaa bataati he ki jail dhah gai he, lekin tasviir se ye nahin pataa lagata he ki sabhi log maar die hai
 Iraq's foreign minister said that we do not have any concrete evidence of being alive or killed, there is no information after 2016
 lekin phir bhi talash jari he
 i have appealed to him to provide whatever information he has with the evidence, i cannot talk to the family without proof
 maine unase jail ke wardan se baat karne ko kaha he jisase bharatiyon ke bare main kuch pataa chal sake
 These Indian people were construction works there but got stuck there
 sushamaa ne kaha ki saboot ke taur par agar wo hindi main apana naam or ghar kaa pataa likh kar den to hamen madad milegi
 We have been given full confidence on their behalf
 maine kabhi sansad ko gumraah nahin kiya, mujhe gumraah karne kaa kya phayda miltaa
 i will not get anything from misleading nor will the government
 agar main aaj unhen mara hua ghoshit kar duun to mere liye aasaan he, koi mujhase sawaal nahin poochhega
 i am doing my duty sushamaa ne ek ghatana kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki punjab ke 6 parivaar unase milane aae, or kaha ki 1971 kii ladaai main unhen shahid ghoshit kar diya gaya tha lekin 45 saal baad gaanv ke paas kaa vyakti laut kar aayaa or kaha ki wo log jinda hai
 Since then, that family has been saying that our family members should be brought back
 sushamaa boleen ki ek baccha 7 saal kaa baccha 21 saal pehle khet main apane pita ke saath khelte-khelte sarhad paar kar gaya, uskaa naam nanak singh he
 But his family says that he is in Pakistan, bring him back
 major dhansingh thapa ko pehle shahid ghoshit kiya, unhen puraskaar diya lekin baad main wo jinda nikle
 Sushma said that whatever i say, i will speak with proof, i never said that she is alive or killed
 jab tak koi thos saboot nahin miltaa he main koi nattejey par nahin pahunch sakate hai
 Only one person is saying that he was killed and many of our sources are saying that he is alive
 koi saboot aisa milegaa jo iskaa khulaasa karegaa, main us din kaa intjaar karongi
 At the same time, she will give a statement in the Rajya Sabha at 11 am on Thursday

 The Iraqi foreign minister said he had no "strong evidence" that 39 Indians who were abducted in Mosul three years ago were alive or have died

 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj made a statement on 16 July based on information gathered during the visit of Minister of State for External Affairs VK Singh to Iraq that the abducted Indians could be lodged in the Badush prison in north-west Mosul
 gauratlab he ki iraqi suraksha balon ne kareeb do hafte pehle mosul ko iesas ke kabje se mukt karaayaa tha
 To date no clue is found of 39 Indians missing from the revelation
 aatanki sanghathan islamic state (ISIS) ne mosul ko puri tarah se tabah kar diya he
 India Today / Aaj Tak reached Mosul in Iraq in search of these Indians, where they did not get any hesitation

 Pakistan's Home Minister Rehman Malik said that India should be given access to Ajmal Amir Kasab, the sole surviving terrorist of the Mumbai attacks, so that the seven suspected accused arrested in this regard can be heard

 sunwaayee ke dauraan patiala house court ne dilli police se jald maamle kii chargeshit daakhil karne kaa aadesh diya he
 However, the police have said that they have not yet received permission from the state government
 is par court ne sakht rukh akhriyaar kiya he
 In the treason case, the Patiala House Court said that the police should get permission from the state government as soon as possible
 dilli sarkaar is tarah maamle kii file nahin roak sakati he
 The next hearing of the case will now be held on February 28
 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle is maamle main dilli police ko bhi patiala house court se fatkaar lag chuki he
 Actually, Delhi Police had earlier filed a charge sheet in the JNU case without the permission of the Kejriwal government of Delhi
 jis par court ne kaha tha ki police bina rajya sarkaar kii anumati ke chargeshit kaise daakhil kar sakati he
 Delhi Police had filed a 1200-page charge sheet on 14 January 2018 in the JNU sedition case
 is chargeshit main purv chaatr netaa kanhaiya kumaar, umr khalid, anirbaan bhattacharya or saat anya kashmiri chaatro ko aaropee banaaya gaya he
 However, the allegation of shouting seditious slogans against Kanhaiya or Omar has not been proved
 gauratlab he ki 9 farvari, 2016 main JNU main ek kaarykram yojit kiya tha
 The event was organized to protest the hanging of Afzal Guru, the mastermind of the Parliament attack
 jiske baad ek audio viral hua tha, jisamen kathith taur par deshadrohi naare lagane kii baat kahi gai thi
 Apart from Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid, many opposition parties targeted the Modi government for inclusion of names in the charge sheet

 We could not do that
 vaise eemaandaaree se kahuun to puure toornament main hamaari team acha nahin khel pai
 On the other hand, victorious captain Kumar Sangakkara insisted that his players keep their feet on the ground despite this victory and said that now the next match has to be focused

 We have to keep our feet on the ground
 ‚Äô unhone jeet kaa shrey tharanga or dilashaan ko dete hue kaha, ‚Äòdonon ne behtareen paariyaan kheli
 This reminded me of Headingley (2006)
 ‚Äôsangakaara ne kaha, ‚Äòhamane gendbaaji main bhi acchhee shuruuaat kii or dabaav banaaye rakhaa
 Regarding off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan's hamstring strain, he said that there is nothing to worry about and he will be fit by the next match
