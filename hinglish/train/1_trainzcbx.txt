 Reiterating his election promise, the PM said that his government is committed to this scheme which has been entangled for 40 years
 jabaki is taaja bayaan ke baad pradhanmantri vipaksh ke sidhe nishane par aa gaye hai
 The Congress has accused the Modi government of vandalism and demanded an apology
 congress kahana he ki pradhanmantri banane ke baadanarendra modibijepi ke chunavi vaade ko nazarandaaj karte rahe hai, lekin radio ke jariye 'van rank van pension' yojana kaa raag alaap rahe hai
 The party also criticized the Prime Minister for saying that the matter related to the demand of ex-servicemen was a complex issue
 congress ke varisht netaajay maakan ne kaha, 'durbhagyavash, unhone inamen se ek bhi mudde ko nahin chuaa balki iske bajaay unhone samasyaon ko badha diya or yah kahkar puure mudde ko ulajhaa diya ki van rank, van pension ek bahut hi jatil mudda he
 Reacting to the "mann Ki Baat" program, Ajay Maken said that it is not surprising that after a year has passed, PM told the country about his earlier demand that there are complications
 maakan ne kaha, 'is yojana ko upie sarkaar ne lagu kiya tha or iske liye paanch sau karod rupee bhi aavantit kiye gaye the
 The countrymen were hoping that on the occasion of completion of one year of the NDA government, the Prime Minister would speak about fulfilling the election promises in his 'mann Ki Baat' program

 ' unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri ne radio par purv sainikon se dhary rakhane kii baat kahi he, jabaki unka dhary khatm hota ja rahaa he or iske liye piem jimmedaar hai
 What did PM Modi said before this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing the soldiers in the 'mann Ki Baat' program on Sunday morning, said, 'you have been patient on this subject for 40 years, give me some time to sort it out
 aap mujhapar bharosa rakhie, baaki jinako baaten oochhaalni hongi, vivaad karne honge, apni raajnneeti kerani hogi, unako mubarak
 i have to do what i can for those who live for the country
 ye hi mere iraade hai or mujhe vishwaas he ki mere man kii baat jisamen sivaay sachai ke kuch nahin he, aapke dilon tak pahonchegi
 Reacting to the criticisms of the opposition, especially the Congress, in the matter, Modi said, 'for me to connect with your life, worry about you
 yah na koisarkarikaryakram he, na hi koi raajnneetik kaarykram he
 This is a manifestation of my patriotism
 main phir ek baar mere desh ke sabhi sena ke javaanon ko aagrah karuunga ki raajnneetik roti senkane vaale log chalis saal tak aapke saath khel khelte rahe hai

 Under the first phase in the new strategy, the central government has decided to run a pin-pointed operation, and for this, there was a special discussion on the Bastar area
 is kaamon ke liye 31 march tak kii dedline di gai he
 Apart from this, 500 mobile towers will be installed in all Naxal-affected areas, so that the issue of connectivity can be resolved to some extent

 Schools will also be opened in many areas

 bank main rakhe aapke paise kii suraksha naye saal main bad sakati he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said in the Rajya Sabha that the government is planning to put in place a strong mechanism to protect the common man's money in banks
 unhone is dauraan yah bhi kaha ki diposit insurance limit badhaane ko lekar koi suzav die jate hai, to un par vichaar kiya jayega
 If the government changes the insurance limit, you can get a special gift
 isse bank main rakhe aapke paison kii suraksha kai guna bad sakati he
 This year, the central government is preparing to introduce the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill-2017
 yah bill vipareet paristhitiyon main bainkon ko sahaara dene ke liye laayaa ja rahaa he
 Also read: The new law is coming, your deposits will improve the health of the bankrupt bank, now you get only 1 lakh rupees, in the current time, only 1 lakh rupees of your total money kept in the bank are safe
 iskaa matlab yah he ki kabhi agar koi bank diwalia hota he, to lakhon rupee kii aapaki bachat main se sirf 1 lakh rupee kii diposit surakshit rahegi
 Think of it like this if you have put 5 lakh rupees in a bank
 kisi vajah se bank diwalia ho jaataa he
 If he is not in a position to pay depositors money, then even in such a situation he will have to pay at least 1 lakh rupees
 haalanki 1 lakh se zyada jitani bhi rakam hogi, uski suraksha kii koi guarantee nahin he
 The new security cover to be for 15 lakh rupees, the insurance deposit limit was fixed in 1993
 tab 1 lakh rupee kii tak kediposit ko insurance coverdie jane kaa faisla liya gaya
 The reason for this was that 90 percent of bank accounts had this amount or less
 iconomic times kii ek report ke mutabik ye aankada ab 90 kii jagah 67 fisadi par aa gaya he
 According to the report, if the central government wants to give insurance cover to 90 percent of bank deposits as before, then it will have to increase the limit of 1 lakh to 15 lakh rupees
 isse aam aadmi kii zyada rakam surakshit hogi
 Apart from this, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has already said that in the FRDI bill, adequate arrangements will be made to protect the common man's accumulated capital
 aise main ummid jataai ja sakati he ki is bill main kai aise prastaav kiye ja sakate hai, jo aam aadmi ko phayda pahunchaae

 But light a face lamp of mustard oil - the lamp should face in the south direction - now offer flowers and water and pray for long life and good health
 The burn type lamp for debt relief - night ghee in front of Hanuman Light a one-time lamp - After this, offer Hanuman ji as many laddus as you are - then sit in front of Hanuman ji and recite Hanuman Chalisa 9 times - Next day morning, distribute the whole Prasad among the children, or feed the cow with Nark Chaturdashi
 But how to light a lamp to destroy every kind of obstacle? - In the evening, light a round lamp of ghee in front of Lord Krishna - then offer him the Panchamrita offering - "ॐ Klinka Chant at least 3 garlands of "krishnaya Namah" - After this, pray for the destruction of whatever obstacle is coming in life - Play a conch three times and take the Panchamrut
 What precautions should be taken on Nark Chaturdashi? Burn a big lamp of mustard oil - clean the house before this day - if you cannot worship more worship then at least read Hanuman Chalisa - whatever food is prepared
 usamen pyaaj lahasun kaa prayog na karennarak chaturdashi par karen karj mukti ke upaay- narak chaturdashi par raatri ko ek vishesh prayog karen- hanuman ji ke saamne ek shuddh sarson ke tel kaa deepak jalaaen- iske baad " han hanumate rudratmakaay hoon fat" kaa yathashakti jap karen- jap ke baad hanuman ji se karj mukti kii prarthana karen a post shared by Indian Models (@indianmodelsin) on Dec 11, 2018 at 6:58 pm PSTA post shared by Indian Models (@indianmodelsin) on Dec 11, 2018 at 6:58 pm PST 2ji vivaad main sarkaar kii pareshaaniyaan kam hoti nahin dikh rahi hai

 unnav main kanpur-lakhanu hive par mashhoor bada chauraahaa padataa he
 Once the center of political activities, in the middle of this crossroads, there is a statue of poet Suryakant Tripathi Shaniralaya
 yahaan se lakhanu kii ore kuch dur chalate hi ek ajeeb-si durgandh naak dhakne ko majaboor kar detii he
 It is a region which is famous all over the world for the leather trade
 hive ke kinare kuch dur or badaae par kanpur nivasee 63 varshiya mukhtarul amin kii company ''superhouse limited" kii nau factoriyon kaa samrajya shuru hota he
 Due to them, Superhouse has become the country's largest exporter of goods ranging from leather to safety shoes, fashion shoes, sports shoes, school shoes, portfolio bags
 yahi nahin, ek choti-si jagah main chamade ke itane saare utpaada banaae jane kii misaal puri duniya main duusari nahin he
 In 1977, after graduating from Christ Church College, Kanpur, Amin began to share his father's hand in his ancestral leather business
 pushtaini kaarobaar itnaa bada nahin tha ki unke chaaron bhai usamen shaamil ho saken
 That is why in 1984, Amin formed a company of his own under the name "superhouse Limited" in 1984
 ve bataate hai, ''superhouse naam isliye chunaa gaya, taaki isse kisi bhi prakaar kaa vyavsaay shuru kiya ja sake
 "he 1 in Chamanganj area of kanpur
 5 lakh ru
 With the initial investment of Rs
, He set up a factory in the place of rent and started making leather shoes upper
 shuruyaat main hi unhen britain kii company ''euke sefti shoej" se order milane lage
 Now in need of leather, in 1985 a factory was set up in Unnao
 paison ke intjaam ke liye amin mumbai share bazaar main apni company kaa ek karod ru
 Brought a public issue of
 desh main pehali baar koi ledar company is tarah kaa public ishyu lekar ai thi
 60 lakhs from this
 se adhik kaa intjaam hua
 In the early nineties, UK Safety Shoes found it expensive to make shoes in the UK
 ab is company ne amin ko hi apni factory main puraa juuta banaakar britain bhejne kaa jimmaa saunpa
 For this, in 1992 UK Safety Shoes sent many more expensive machines like "rubber Volcanizing" machine installed in their factory to Amin and Superhouse made safety shoes for the people working in factories and other high risk places for the first time in the country
 started
 500 se 600 jodi juute roj banane lage
 Made of rubber and leather, these shoes were quite heavy
 inke vajan ko halkaa karne ke liye 1994 main ''diarect induction poliurithane" takanic par kaam karne vaali ''desma" mashin factory main lagaai gai
 It is used to make shoes, at that time the world's state-of-the-art and most expensive Rs 2 crore
 kii keemat vaali mashin thi
 Today a total of six Desma machines are installed in Amin's factories
 sefti shoej kii britain main branding or distribution ke liye superhouse ne britain kii company bricks footvier kaa adhigrahan kar liya he
 The demand for safety shoes was limited
 so, kaarobaar badhaane ke liye amin ne 1998 main fishan footvier ke kshetra main kadam rakhaa
 In Unnao itself, a man-made shoe factory was opened along the lucknow-kanpur highway
 amin ne in juuton kaa namakaran bade rochak dhang se kiya
 He explains, "in the British Raj, two British merchants Allen and Cooper started a leather factory in Kanpur
 in donon ke naam ko milakar hamane alan-kupar naam se apana juute kaa brand launch kiya
 "in a short period of time these shoes made their mark in Britain
 amin kaa kaarobaar zyaadaatar niryaat aadhaarit tha
 To further accelerate this, he created a company called "superhouse UK" in Lester, UK and started distributing fashion footwear in the UK
 nattejey achche aae
 In 2012, fashion footwear was launched in the UK market under the name "silver Street"
 britain main apni company ke jariye amin keval bade retail dukandaaron ke saath hi kaam kar paa rahe the
 They did not have the necessary network to work with smaller retailers
 iske liye 2015 main britain kii company ''patric shoej" kharid kar iske jariye chote retail dukandaaron ke saath bhi amin ne fishan footvier kaa kaarobaar aage badhaayaa
 The caravan of Superhouse Limited was not limited to Britain alone
 aaj germany, france or spain main bhi amin apni companiyon ke jariye juuton kaa kaarobaar kar rahe hai
 Safety shoes account for 26 per cent of the total business of personal protective products, while safety clothing accounts for close to 40 per cent
 haalanki sefti shoej or ''sefti garment" kaa bazaar ek hi tha
 So in 2012, Amin started making safety garments by setting up another factory in Unnao
 kuch hi samay main superhouse sefti garment ke niryaat main bhi desh kii agrani company ban gai
 Safety belts were also started in the same factory last year
 kanpur main ghudsawaari kaaphi prachlit he isliye maang ko dekhte hue superhouse limited ne ''riding product'' bhi bananaa shuru kiya
 Today, Superhouse is the largest company in the country to manufacture equestrian products
 superhouse limited kaa assi fisadi kaarobaar niryaat par tikaa he
 This business has reached its peak
 aisi sthiti main amin ab desi bazaar main bhi apni dhamak dikhaane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 He explains, "our goal is that within the next few years our business within the country surpasses the total exports
 "amin ne kanpur main shiksha ke kshetra main bhi dhak jamaai he
 In 1983, the Delhi Public School Society gave its school franchise to a private person for the first time in the country
 amin ne kanpur ke sarvoday nagar main dilli public skool kholaa
 Today, they operate a total of seven branches of Delhi Public School in different areas of Uttar Pradesh
 amin ne 2005 main alan house public skool ke naam se khud kaa skool kholaa
 "we had two brands, Superhouse and allen-cooper," he explains
 inhen ko aapas main milakar alan-house banaaya gaya
 "today allen-house Public School is the most prestigious school in Kanpur
 1980 ke dashak main chamade ke ek chote-se kaarkaane se shuru amin kaa udhyam ek myne main aaj puure udyog main agrani ban gaya he
 The group has companies in several countries outside the country, including the UK, the United States, the United Arab Emirates and Romania
 samooh kaa kaarobaar 800 karod ru
 Has exceeded
 yah apni saamaajik jimmedaariyon main shiksha ke kshetra ke alaava jal sangrakshan or sansadhano ke samuchit prayog kejariye paryaavaran sangrakshan main bhi yogadan kaa daawa karata he
 But Amin tells the secret of his success to work with an open mind and honesty

 There is a lot of discussion about the chemistry of Sunny and Imran in this song released recently

 Badshaho is an action film and is said to be inspired by an incident during the Emergency period
 rajdhani dilli main ek 11 saal kii bacchee se rape kaa maamla saamne aayaa he

 The scared girl told the family about the incident
 jiske baad parijanon ne police ko isaki soochna di

 aaropee mustakeen ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 376, 50, 6 or poxo act ke tahat maamla darj kiya gaya he
 The investigation of the case is going on
 aapako yaad hoga ham 'vaardaat' main aapke liye 'oparation ghaghara' kii wo chaunkaane vaali kahani lekar aae the, jisamen drugs ke dhandhebaaz ghaghara, juute, chappal yaa tauliye jaisi kisi maamuli chiz main karodon kii drugs chipa kar unki smagaling karte hue pakade gaye the
 Now in Operation Ghaghra 'part Two', the talk of an operation of Narcotics Control Bureau in which the latest consignment of drugs was caught in the presence of Ghaghre
 ek fansy ghaghare kii qeemat aam taur par kitni ho sakati he? aap kahenge yahi das se 15 hazaar rupye
 By the way, hobby is a big thing
 jisaki koi qeemat nahin hoti
 The wearers also wear ghagra worth millions of rupees
 lekin agar ham aapako kisi maamuli se ghaghare kii qeemat hi karodon main bataaen, to ise aap kya kahenge?yah dhandha he ghaghare main heroin chhipaakar supplai karne kaa
 Under the brocade in the ghagra, the strip of heroin is so closely concealed that one cannot imagine from the top that anything can be hidden under this carving and embroidery
 lekin haqiqat yahi he ki ek ghaghare ke zari work ke neeche chhipaai gai is safed rang chiz kii badaulat hi is maamuli se ghaghare kii qeemat puure dedh karod rupye tak pahunch gai he
 Actually, this white colored strip is the consignment of death, which was sent by drug smugglers sitting across the seven seas, hidden under the gurrywork of Ghaghre to further reach their customers
 ye khep he duniya se sabase ghaatak nashon main se ek heroin kii
 One such racket has been busted by the fast track officers of NCB i
e
 Narcotics Control Bureau
 ek khufia khabar kii badaulat enasibi ke haath videsh se bhijwaaye gaye is nashile ghaghare tak ja pahunche hai
 This consignment, sent from abroad to the office of a courier company in Delhi, was to be forwarded to Malaysia
 lekin isse pehle ki aisa hota, ghaghare ke dhaage udhed kar enasibi ne smagalleron kii bakhiya udhed di
 This is how narcotics works: NCB, delhitarikh: May 13, 2014 Time: 02 in the afternoon
 00 bajiichanak beuro ke mukhyalay main telephone kii ghanti bajati he
 On the other hand, the caller gives an intelligence report to the bureau officials and at the same time there is a stir in the office of the drug trafficker
 inspector us jaankaree ko fouran darj karte hai or suparitendent jonal diarector se mashvira karne fouran unke chember main ja pahunchate hai
 There is a lot of buzz in this office and the arrival of the officers is enough to tell that this time the officials of the Narcotics Control Bureau have received any information, which is a big challenge for them to reach the end
 bahut mumkin he ki enasibi ke afasaron ko ye choti lekin ahm si jaankaree kisi bade drug cartil tak pahunchaa de
 Now immediately on the instruction of the zonal director, a team of high-ranking officers of the department is prepared under the leadership of the Superintendent
 is team ko abhi ke abhi ek red par nikalnaa he or chunki ye khabar nashe kii khep se judi he, is red main khatara bhi kam nahin he
 This means to say that drug dealers can go to any extent on seeing themselves surrounded
 lihaaza, ek taraf jahaan narcotics ke maahir afasaron kii team drug ditection kit taiyaar karne main jute jaati he, vahiin duusari taraf kuch log asalhon ke saath apni hifaazat kii puri taiyaari kar lete hai
 Actually, narcotics experts can check the recovered drug on the occasion of a crime through a drug detection kit
 isse haathon-haath naa sirf tasalli ho jaati he, balki ye bhi pataa chal jaataa he ki baraamad kii gai nashe kii khep akhir kis drug kii he or quality kya he? jabaki aslhon se zarurat padane par dhandhebaazon ko munh tod jawaab diya ja saktaa he
 Now the last minute briefing takes place in the office and then the team immediately leaves for their whereabouts with the intention of intercepting a drug dealer
 khaas baat ye he ki is team ke chand senior afasaron ke alaava zyaadaatar mambers ko ab tak ye pataa nahin he ki akhir red kab, kahaan or kitne baje honevaali he? kyonki kam se kam input share karne se red ke zyaada se zyaada kaamyaab hone kii gunjaaish rahati he or tab enasibi kii team aarake puram ke raaston se hoti hui south dilli ke posh ilaakon main se ek saket ke liye ravaanaa ho jaati he
 The distance from RK Puram to Saket is about 9 kilometers and the NCB team completes this journey in about 12 minutes and now is the time for Operation Death
 or ab karrwai kaa vakrub asli karrwai yani oparation deth kaa vaqt nazadik aa chukaa he
 NCB officials see a white colored car on the streets of Saket
 afasar is car ko intercept kar rokane kii koshish karte hai
 But as is suspected, the driver of this car tries to drive the vehicle faster instead of stopping the vehicle by obeying the officers
 lekin pehle se taiyaar enasibi kii team akhirkaar is car ko rukvane main kaamyaab ho jaati he
 And before the driver of the car takes any other action, NCB officers immediately take the driver and take him down from the car
 ab tak ke halaat to yahi ishaara kar rahe hai ki enasibi ke daftar main ai khufia khabar bilkul sahi he or car main koi na koi nashe kii khep zarur he, jise chipa kar car kaa driver kahin delivery ke liye ja rahaa he
 NCB officials now closely scrutinize the entire car
 car main kai bag hai
 The police do not feel anything special with these bags
 lekin car main chipa kar rakhaa gaya ek packet lagata he kuch minuton kii talaashi ke baad car main chipa kar rakhaa gaya ek packet enasibi ko zarur mil jaataa he
 The particular way in which this packet is prepared, at first glance, raises doubt
 ab afasar fouran maukey par hi afasar is packet ko kholte hai or agle hi pal unke haath lagata he ki maut kaa wo saamaan international market main jisaki qeemat lakhon main ho sakati he
 On the spot, the NCB officers investigate the goods recovered from this packet with the help of drug detection kit and finally their suspicions are corrected
 ji haa, is packet main heroin he
 Approximately two hundred and fifty grams of this heroin may cost millions in the international market
 is driver se hui poochtacha se afasaron ko zyaada kuch to nahin pataa chalaa, lekin isi kadi main unke haath us tauliye tak zarur ja pahunchate hai, jisaki qeemat takreeban ek karod 20 lakh rupye he
 In fact, in the investigation, it is found that the person who was arrested with heroin from the car was just a career, which was assigned by a courier company
 use is drug cartil ke bare main zyaada jaankaree nahin thi, lekin enasibi ko ise bahaane ye zarur pataa chal gaya ki courier companiyon ke raste dilli main drugs kii khep mangai jane lagi he
 Now NCB kept an eye on the courier companies and soon its hands reached a packet which had a towel pack of Rs 12 million

 To identify him, those who have been identified have told their names to the police? Did anyone say that they will not take action which is to be done
 ' tab tak sonu ke bade bhai ne bataaya ki jahaan ghatana ghatit hui thi vahaan par thodi dur par hi dial 100 police khadi thi
 She could catch it if she wanted
 goli chal rahi thi
 Four five rounds were fired

 The Supreme Court said that the state police will not investigate in this matter till April 24 at present

 The court should allow the case to continue to be investigated

 Lt
 Col
 Karmaveer Singh, father of Major Aditya Kumar of 10 Garhwal Rifle, has said in the petition filed in the Supreme Court that to save the honor of the national flag and to protect the morale of Indian Army soldiers who have sacrificed their lives
 jis tareeke se rajya main raajnneetik netritv dwaara FIR kaa chithran kiya gaya or rajya ke ucch prashasan ne project kiya isse lagata he ki rajya main vipareet sthiti he
 This is a violation of his son's right to equality and right to live
 tippaniyan The police have acted in an arbitrary manner by making the son an accused in the case, knowing that he was not present at the scene and the army personnel were working peacefully
 jabaki hinsak bheed kii vajah se wo sarkari sampatti ko bachaane ke liye kanoonee taur par karwaai karne ke liye majaboor hue
 This army convoy was going on the instructions of the central government and was performing its duty
 ye kadam liya gaya jab bheed ne patharav kiya or hinsak bheed ne kuch javaanon ko peet peet kar maar daalane kii koshish kii or desh virdohi gatividhiyon ke khilaaf karrwai se rokane kii koshish kii gai
 Such an attack was done to lower the morale of the army
 yachika main maang kii gai he aatanki gatividhiyon or sarkari sampatiyon ko nuksaan pahunchane or kendriya karmchaariyon ke jivan ko khatre main daalane vaale logon ke khilaaf FIR darj kii jaae or puure maamle kii jaanch duusare rajya main kisi swatantra agency se karai jaae
 The state government should be prevented from taking such decisions in the case of the army and in such a situation a guide line should be made to protect the soldiers
 duty par tainaat sena ke javaanon ko is tarah kii sthiti main muaavje kaa praavdhaan kiya jaae

 According to party sources, during the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, the BJP can give tickets to the leaders who have won the election over the age of 75 years, but they will neither be made ministers nor will be given any position in the party
 darasal, 2014 main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv main centre main bijepi kii sarkaar bani 75+ netaaon ko na to mantri banane or na hi unhen party main koi pad dene kaa nirnay liya gaya tha
 Under this, apart from LK Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi, leaders of more than 75 years were not included in the cabinet, including Shanta Kumar, BC Khanduri, Hukum Dev Yadav, Kariya Munda, Bijaya Chakraborty
 modi sarkaar main 75 kii umr puri hone par calraj mishra, najma hepatulla ko mantrimandal se istipha dena padaa tha
 Also, in the 2019 elections 75+ leaders were being considered for not giving tickets, but BJP can no longer bring this decision in acid
 rajasthan main 75+ netaaon kaa umdaa parformansbijepi ne rajasthan chunaav main 75 saal se zyada umr ke teen netaaon tikat diya, jinamein jodhpur se suryakanta vyas, bhilwara se kailash meghavaal or bikaner se gopal joshi shaamil he

 rajasthan main chunaav se pehle piem modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne pradesh kii kaman 75 saal ke madanlaal saini ko pradesh kii kaman saunpi thi
 Now it is to be seen that only those who are over 75 years of age give tickets, then the leaders of bjp's Board of Guides LK Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi will get tickets in the 2019 elections

 saamana ne maharashtra kii siyasat par bijepi ko gheraabijepi par lagaaya horse trading kaa aropabijepi ne kii shivasena ko jhootha sabit karne kii koshishmaharashtra kii raajnneeti badal chuki he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray is going to take oath as Chief Minister on November 28
 shivasena ke mukhpatr shivasena ne apni is kootnithik jeet par bhartiya janata party(bijepi) par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Targeting the BJP through Samana, the Shiv Sena said that everyone's rage flew into the air
 aakhirkaar devendra fadanvis kii kshanik sarkaar vishwasamat ke pehle hi gir gai
 Saamana notes that Ajit Pawar, with whose support Fadnavis claimed to form the government, had already resigned as Deputy Chief Minister and two legislators were not left with Ajit Pawar
 iskaa vishwaas ho jane par devendra fadanvis ko bhi janaa padaa
 The government sitting on the neck of Maharashtra in a corrupt and illegal manner, departed in just 72 hours
 saamana main likhaa gaya he ki samvidhan diwas ke din hi sarvocch nyaayalay kaa ye faisla aana or thilishahi or damanshahi kii raajnneeti karanevaalon ko jhatka laganaa, ise bhi ek sukhad sanyog kaha jayega
 Even if the rulers had marketed democratic values and principles, the Supreme Court decision demolished it
 agent paison kaa bag lekar vidhayakon ke peeche gum rahe the
 The attempt to rule by buying majority failed
 supreme court kaa rajbhavan kii niti par sawalsamna ne devendra fadanvis or ajit pavaar ke shapath grahan par nishaanaa sadhate hue likhaa ki janata kaa to kahana tha hi lekin mangalvaar kii subah supreme court ne bhi rajbhavan kii niti par sawaal khadey kar die
 An order was made to prove the majority in 24 hours, and then no astrologer was required to tell that the Fadnavis' illegally formed government would fall
 bijepi ne kiya samvidhan diwas manaane kaa dhongsaamana main bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha gaya he ki bahumat kaa aankada na hone ke baavjood fadanvis ne mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee
 This first offense and the support with which he was sworn in, canceled all the corruption charges against Ajit Pawar within four hours, the second crime
 is aparaadh ke liye jagah chuni gai mumbai kaa rajbhavan
 Where the Constitution should be protected, the protectors of those constitutions shielded this crime
 isliye aaj jinhone samvidhan diwas manaane kaa dhong kiya, sarvocch nyaayalay ne unhen bhi chapat lagaai he
 'what will ED, IT and BJP workers do now?' It is written that on Monday evening, 162 mlas of Mahagadi demonstrated unity before the people of the country
 isse bhartiya janata party ke bahumat kii hawa hi nikal gai
 This was a majority defeat outside the hall
 ham vidhayakon ko todenge or bahumat sabit karenge, is vikruti par bhi sarvocch nyaayalay ne nakel kasi
 The court gave such a clear order, instead of secret ballot, during the majority inspection
 ab ‘idi or inakam tex’ aadi bhaajapa ke kaaryakarta kya karenge?saamana main likhaa gaya he kiloktantric mulyon kii raksha honi chahie
 People have the right to get good government, a view expressed by the Supreme Court
 bhartiya janata party se hamaara vyaktigat jhagada nahin he lekin jate-jate fadanvis ne ham par aarope lagaae hai
 He has spoken about the helplessness of the Shiv Sena for power
 ye kahana vaise hi he jaise ulta chor kotwaal ko daante
 Before you call the Shiv Sena helpless for power, first look at the dust accumulated on yourself
 'satta kii laachaari bijepi par padi baari'saamana main likhaa gaya he ki ajit pavaar se unhen ‘najdiki’ chalati he lekin shivasena ke saath jo baat tay hui thi, usase palati markar kya mila? satta kii laachaari na hoti or die gaye vachanon kaa paalan karne kii ichha hoti to bhaajapa par ye naubat na aati
 You lied and tried to prove Shiv Sena a liar
 isliye maharashtra kii sthirataa or swabhimaan ke liye ham teen partiyon ne ek saath aane kaa faisla liya
 It is written in Saamana that when BJP took the support of nationalist in 2014 for stability in Maharashtra, it was not helpless at that time, then how helpless? bjp's failure is that what they did in other states is not in Maharashtra Able to maharashtra ne dabaav ko jhidak diya or vidhayakon ne atmasamman banaae rakhaa
 Maharashtra is the land of Shivrai
 yahaan swabhimaan kii jwalamukhi sadaiv dadhakati rahati he
 Whenever he tried to suppress this self-respect, Maharashtra gave him water
 satta ke liye kyon bekaraar bijepi?saamana main likhaa gaya he ki maharashtra main satta ke liye bijepi itani bekaraar kyon thi? itnaa aniatik or siddhanthavihin aacharan karnaa dinadayal upaadhyaay aurrtal bihari vaajapeyi ke anuyaayiyon ke liye durbhagyapurna he
 Despite our showing a figure of 162 people, they made a disgusting attempt to justify us
 ab bahumat pareekshan ke pehle hi fadanvis kii sarkaar bhaag nikali
 No government or political party in Maharashtra had so much disrepute so far
 ajit pavaar ne aakhri kshanon main apana vastraharan roak liya lekin bhaajapa puri tarah se nagn ho gai
 The turmoil in Maharashtra came to an end
 ab sab shubh hoga

 His party MP Dinesh Trivedi, who was removed from the post of Railway Minister at the behest of Trinamool Congress President Mamata Banerjee due to the proposal to increase passenger fares in the Railway Budget, said that most political parties in India, especially regional parties, became 'feudal' And make arbitrary decisions
 ek sansadeey dal ke sadsy kii haisiyat se yahaan aae trivedi ne haalanki yah bhi kaha ki chamachagiri yaa chapalusee se kisi bhi netaa ko phayda nahin ho rahaa he
 He said that gradually there has been a very dangerous trend in the last few years in which most political parties have become jagirs
 yahaan aantarik loktantr nahin he, muddon par na to bahes kii jaati he or na hi charchaa kii jaati he
 Trivedi said that i am not talking about any one political party, i am saying a general thing that whatever the head of the party says, there is never any discussion on it
 unhone kaha ki aisi sthiti main party ke sadasyon ko dar bana rahata he ki agar vah netaa yaa pramukh ke faislon ke khilaaf kuch bhi kahenge to agali baar unhen chunaav main tikat nahin milegaa
 Trivedi said that for me the country comes first, then the family and then the party
 unhone spasht kar diya ki vah keval apane vichaar jaahir kar rahe hai or trinmul congress ke pravaktaa kii haisiyat se nahin bol rahe hai
 When Trivedi proposed an increase in passenger fares in the Railway Budget in March, Trinamool Congress President Mamata Banerjee forced him to step down
 unhone kaha ki agar ham party kaa nahin, balki ek vyakti kaa kaam karne ja rahe hai to mujhe lagata he ki yah bharat main ek atyant khatarnaak ghatnakram he jo ki abhivyakti kii swatantraaa or loktantr ke siddhanton ke khilaaf hoga
 Trivedi said that personally i think something needs to be done because corruption is very high in India and it starts at the political level
 raajnneetik dal saamanti ban gaye hai
 He said that the time has come when the 'whip system' can be thought again
 unhone kaha ki ek raajnneetik dal main rahete hue agar mere paas alag najariya he to iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki main lard rahaa hum, yah loktantr kii majbootee he
 Trivedi said that i think we have become intolerant, politically we are extremely intolerant
 trinmul netaa ne kaha ki congress or bhaajapa jaise rashtriya dalon ko chhod den to raajnneetik dalon main ek hi vyakti faisle karata he or samuhik nirnay kii koi gunjaaish nahin he
 Trivedi said that as far as the country is concerned, it seems strange
 america main log mujhase poochhate hai ki jisane rail bajet pesh kiya he to kya vah aapkaa nijee bajet he, party kaa bajet he yaa sangheey bajet he
 When everyone is praising the budget, how can anyone be removed from the middle
 unhone kaha ki isliye bharat kii loktantric prakriya sawaalon ke ghere main he
 In my opinion, this has also raised questions on Indian parliamentary democracy
 pashchim bengal main trinmul congress ke kaamkaaj ke bare main trivedi ne kaha ki vah mukhyamantri mamata banerjee kii saraahna karte hai ki is sthiti main aane ke liye unhone teen dashak se lambii ladaai ladi
 He said that but being in opposition and being in government is a different thing
 jab aap sarkaar main hote hai to log aapaki ore ummid bhari najar se dekhte hai or aapke paas adhikaar hote hai
 In my opinion, Bengal needs fresh air today

 According to com, Mark's captivating story began in 1984 in the White Plains area of new York
 '90 ke dashak main unke pita ne unhen ataari basic programing (atari BASIC Programming) sikhaa di, or uske baad mark ko padhaane ke ek software develper ko privet tutor ke taur par rakhaa gaya
 Mark did a graduate course in the same subject from Mercy College near his home, while he was still studying in high school
 mark ke pita daanton ke doctor the, so unki madad ke uddeshy se 1996 main mark ne ek software program 'zuknet' (zucknet) banaaya, jiske jariye ghar or pita ke dental offis main maujuud sabhi computaron ke bich sidhaa sampark saadhaa ja sake
 Today, 'zuknet' is considered to be an early version of aol's instant messenger, which was actually launched the next year to become 'zuknet'

 so, ab ham aapse poochhate hai - agar aap kisi company ke maalik hote to is sivi par nigaah daalane ke baad mark zukarbarg ko naukari par rakhte yaa nahin
 
 
 Or leave job, call for interview or not
 
 
 ? Mark's father was a dentist, so in 1996, Mark created a software program 'zucknet' to help him make direct connections between all computers in the home and father's dental office
 aaj 'zuknet' ko hi eoel (AOL) ke instent massenger kaa shuruaati sanskaran mana jaataa he, jo darasal 'zuknet' banane ke agle saal launch kiya gaya tha

 According to the story written on com, Mark did many controversial acts during college, one of which was the creation of the Facemash app, in which users had to tell who is 'hot', who is not 'hot' '

 Some consider 'facemash' to be the predecessor of the most popular dating app 'tinder'

 com says that Mark's CV is impressive even before Facebook, but that developer seems more like an entrepreneur walking around with less, new business ideas
 bahut kam log yah tathy jaanate hai ki usne harvard main psychology main major kiya tha, computer science main nahin
 So, now we ask you - if you were the owner of a company, after looking at this CV, whether or not to hire Mark Zuckerberg

 Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 in teenon rajyon main 6 maah pehle hue vidhansabha chunaav main congress ne jeet hasil karke sabko chaunkaa diya tha
 The Congress was hopeful that it would return to the Lok Sabha elections thanks to victory in these three states
 lekin jab loksabhaa ke nattejey aae to congress ko jhatka laga
 The Congress is seen winning only 3 seats out of 65 Lok Sabha seats in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 chhattisgarh main congress ko 2 siten milti dikh rahi hai to vahiin madhya pradesh main ek seat par hi congress ko badhat mili he
 Whereas, in Rajasthan, even the account of the Congress is not open
 raajnneetik jaankaron kaa kahana he ki congress kii haar ke kai kaaran he
 Firstly, in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, local issues like employment, farmers, roads were dominating the assembly elections
 isliye bijepi se behatar congress ko logon ne pasand kiya
 If seen, the BJP had power in these three states for 15 years and people did not see the issues being resolved in the assembly elections under the BJP
 isliye congress ko chunaa
 But people voted in the Lok Sabha elections seeing the face of the Prime Minister
 taaja nateezon main teenon rajyon ke voters congress se duuri bataate dikhe
 People voted on seeing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's face
 yahaan tak ki har rajya main bijepi ne piem ke naam par bhi vot maange

 dhyaan dene vaali baat yah he ki loksabhaa chunaav 2019 kii prakriya jab shuru hui thi us vakt bijepi ne centre sarkaar kii yojanaon kii safaltaaen ginaayin thi
 Even BJP had claimed that it will return to power in the trust of the beneficiaries of the central government schemes
 lekin jaise-jaise chunaav abhiyaan aage badhata gaya vaise-vaise 'hindutv' or 'rashtrawaad' kaa mudda gahraane laga he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP President Amit Shah and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley surrounded the Congress, making Hindutva an issue
 yahaan tak ki congress ko 'hindu aatankwaad' kaa janak bataate hue bhopal loksabhaa seat se sadhvi pragna ko bhi tikat di
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi also accused Congress President Rahul Gandhi that he is contesting from the seat of Wayanad because he is Muslim majority and majority are in minority here
 karj maafi kaa daanv ulta pad gaya
 
 
 During the assembly elections of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, the Congress played the wagering debt of farmers
 congress ne teenon rajyon main sarkaar banane ke 10 din ke bheetar kisaanon ke karj ko maaf kar diya tha
 But after this bet of Congress, BJP also used its trump card
 bijepi ne kisaan sammaan yojana kaa elaan kiya jiske tahat har saal kisaanon ko 6 hajaar rupee dene kii baat kahi gai
 Through this scheme, the farmers of the three states were also helped by the BJP

 Three IAS officers serving their services in the Delhi government have petitioned the Delhi High Court by pleading that the Speaker of the Assembly should not take any strict action against them

 During the hearing of the petition of 3 IAS officers of Delhi Government, the counsel for the officers said that the petition is already pending in the Supreme Court whether the officers should obey the order of the Delhi Government or that of LG
 bataa den ki philhal ye power alji ke paas he
 Especially when there are issues related to land, law and order and service, the orders of the ministers of the Delhi government cannot be implemented unless its approval is met with the LG
 adhikariyon kii taraf se pesh hue aman lekhi ne kaha ki vidhansabha ke paas is tarah kii koi privillage hi nahin he ki wo vidhansabha gailaree main kisi adhikari ko bulaaen
 The job of the assembly speaker is to run the assembly
 dilli act adhikariyon ko protection detaa he jisase unke kaam main netaa koi raajnneetik dabaav nahin daal saktaa
 Aman Lekhi said that if the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly or the minister of the government is angry with an officer, then he has called in the assembly gallery today
 kal court main aane ko bol sakate hai, lekin unki ichha kya unhen kanoonee rup se isaki ijaajat detii he? sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha gaya ki jab sarkaar ke paas adhikariyon ko vidhansabha gailaree main bulaane kaa koi kanoonee or sanvaidhanik adhikaar hi nahin he to phir adhikari bhi aam naagarik hai or wo apana faisla lene ke liye swatantra hai ki wo jaaen yaa naa jaaen
 The counsel for the Delhi government said that the questions to which the Delhi government had received answers from the officials before the Anshu Prakash case, have now stopped responding to the same issues
 logon ke chune hue pratinidhiyon or vidhansabha ko janata se jude sawaalon ke jawaab milane chahie, ye unka adhikaar he
