 uttar bharat main kshetreey dalon ke taiyaar ho rahe taqatvar gathbandhan se hone vaale nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye bijepi dakshini rajya tamilnadu or maharashtra main rashtriya loktantric gathbandhan kaa dayera majboot karne va congress ke netritv vaale bikhare mahagathbandhan ke alaava rajyon kii taqatvar partiyon ko saath laane kii mashkkat main jute gai he
 Parties know that a big win is necessary with more votes and a bigger win will depend on the number of parties involved in the coalition
 aankade bataate hai ki zyada vot paanaa hameshaa seat kii guarantee nahin he or is vot percentage or seat ke sameekaran ko gathbandhan kii raajnneeti kinare kar detii he
 Elections from 1999 to 20014 mainly saw three alliances
 vahi gathbandhan satta tak pahunchaa jisane sabase zyada partiyon ke saath samjhauta kiya
 In 1999, the NDA formed an alliance with 19 parties while the Congress-led UPA alliance contested 11 parties
 bijepi ke netritv main endie ne sarkaar banaai
 After that, in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the NDA had 7 fewer parties since 1999, while the UPA contested with a coalition of 20 parties
 is baar centre main upie ne sarkaar banaai
 Even in 2009, the UPA had two parties more than the NDA, from above Mulayam Singh and BSP supported the UPA government without asking
 teesraa morcha yani third front 2014 tak aate-aate bikhar gaya
 In 2014, the NDA again added more parties than the UPA
 2009 ke mukaable 8 partiyon ko gathbandhan main shaamil karte hue 18 partiyon ke saath chunaav ladate hue 336 seat jitkar sarkaar banaai
 Look at the most direct example of how an alliance dominates democracy
 bihar main 2014 ke chunaav main jediu 16 fisadi vot ke saath loksabhaa kii keval do siten jeet pai jabaki ramvilas paswan kii party mahaj saadhe chah fisadi vot lekar 6 seat jeetne main safal rahi
 This shows that it is necessary to have a winning coalition more than the wind of the parties in the election
 gathbandhan sarkaar kii sahyogi choti partiyaan bhale hi sansad main zyada sankhya main nahin pahunchin magar ek tay vot bank kaa duusare kshetra main badi party ko zyada phayda mila
 Despite a landslide victory in 1999, the NDA government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee lost in 2004
 india shining campan kii vifaltaa ke saath-saath badi vajah gathbandhan se saat chote dalon kaa nikalnaa bhi tha
 The BJP, with 182 seats in 1999, won just 138 seats in 2004
 bijepi ne 2004 loksabhaa chunaavon main mili jatke se sikh lee he or 2014 se aage badhkar 2019 main gathbandhan ko or vistaar dene main jute gai he
 However, with the coming of Mayawati's BSP and Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party in UP, he is expected to face a big setback
 2004 main sapa or basapa ne bijepi ko 80 siton main se keval 10 par roak diya tha
 The BSP got 19 seats in 2004 and the SP 35 seats
 ab jab donon taqatvar dal ek saath hai to aise main bijepi ke liye 2004 se bhi badi mushkil khadi hone vaali he
 The challenge for BJP and Nitish Kumar has also increased with the arrival of old leaders of NDA, especially Upendra Kushwaha and Jitan Ram Manjhi with Lalu Yadav and Congress's grand alliance in Bihar
 2004 main argedy ke netritv vaale congress or ram vilaas paswan kii lok janashakti party ne 40 main se 29 seat jeet lee thim
 BJP and Janata Dal United had got only 11 seats
 2019 main halaat badal chuke hai
 Paswan is with the NDA but former NDA partners Upendra Kushwaha and Jeetan Manjhi have become part of the UPA
 bijepi in siton par hone vaale sambhavit nukasaan kii bharpai ke liye dakshini rajya tamilnadu or maharashtra main shivasena ke saath phir se gathbandhan kaa elaan kiya he
 Congress has also decided to take Sharad Pawar along
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main endie ne piemke or emdmake ke saath gathbandhan kii vajah se ek seat par kamyaabi pai thi jabaki ediemke ne 39 main se 37 seat jeet lee thim
 Now in 2019, BJP feels that AIADMK should take this time by any means
 haalanki ediemke 2004 main bhi bijepi ke netritv vaale endie kaa hissaa rahi he
 AIADMK was the only party in the 2004 NDA coalition of 12 parties that could not win a single seat
 tamilnadu main diemke or choti partiyon ke saath upie gathbandhan main siton par atim faisla ho rahaa he
 Congress can contest 9 seats in Tamil Nadu and DMK on 25 seats
 upie paanch siten anya chote dalon ko dene par vichaar kar rahaa he
 In Maharashtra, Shiv Sena and BJP are back together under the NDA banner
 bijepi 25 or shivasena 23 siton par ladane ja rahi he
 In response to this alliance, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party i
e
 NCP have joined hands
 1999 ke kharaab pradarshan ke baad congress or ensipi 2004 main bhi saath aae the
 In 2004, both parties won 23 seats in Maharashtra
 2019 kaa chunaav kshetreey partiyon ke naam hoga
 The big parties led by the coalition are planning a strategy to win big on their own
 raajnneetik rup se yah maahaul kareeb-kareeb 2004 jaisaa he, jahaan 1999 ke baad vipaksh khaastaur par upie kisi bhi tarah endie ko satta se baahar rakhane ke liye aatur tha

 If someone asks which schemes were the most discussed after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister, then on the way, the words of the person's tongue will be the same - Make in India, Digital India, Stand Up India, Start Up India, Namami Ganges, Jan Dhan and Clean India
 ye naam pichley do saal main itani baar dohraye ja chuke hai ki ye modi sarkaar kii pahchaan si ban gaye hai
 But a few days after the fire at the grand event of Make in India in Mumbai, when Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presented the budget in Delhi on February 29, it seemed as if the tone of these tinkling words had blown
 jetali bajet to modi sarkaar kaa pesh kar rahe the, lekin dariyaadilii un yojanaon kii taraf dikhaa rahe the, jo kabhi purvavarti manmohan singh sarkaar kii sirmaur hua karti thim
 If Modi government's favorite 13 schemes, Jaitley gets around Rs 40,000 crore from his budget
 aavantit kiye to manmohan ke jamaane main jalavagar raheen chah yojanaon ko hi ek lakh karod ru
 Paid more than Rs
 yah shaayad virala mauka hoga ki koi sarkaar apni priy yojanaon ke badale puraani yojanaon par is kadar bharosa kar rahi ho
 This can also be seen as the independence of the NDA government and its own schemes being less popular among the public
 baharhaal, bajet main modi kii jis yojana par sabase zyada maar padi, vah he ganga nadi se judi yojanaayen
 The Namami Gange Mission received just Rs 2,250 crore in this budget
 mili hai
 Not only this, the budget allocation of the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation was Rs
 se ghataakar 6,021 karod ru
 Has been done
 yani modi ke prachaar abhiyaan se lekar pradhanmantri banane tak sabasejyada surkhiyon main rahe ganga nadi se jude mantralay ke bajet main 14 fisadi kii katautee kii gai
 Similarly, the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, which was announced loudly in January, was dropped from the list of major budget plans
 is yojana ko 5,500 karod ru
 Was allocated
 krishi mantralay ke mutabik, 50 fisadi kisaanon ke liye 8,800 karod ru
 Whereas, at least Rs 5,700 crore to bring 30 per cent farmers under its purview
 kii jarurat bataai gai thi
 But the budget allocation was less than all estimates
 is tarah yah yojana bamushkil paanch fisadi atirikt kisaanon ko daayre main laa sakegi, desh main philhal 23 fisadi kisaan beemaa ke daayre main hai
 However, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh considers the allocation sufficient
 unka kahana he, “paise kii koi kami nahin he, jitani jarurat padegi, mil jayega
 The fact is that the farmers will be paid the entire sum assured, which was not there before
 ” isi tarah desh kii baaki bachi 65 fisadi acinchit jameen ko sinchit karne ke uddeshy se banaai gai, pradhanmantri krishi vikaas yojana ko is saal 5,717 karod ru
 Were allocated
 vahiin manmohan singh ke jamaane se chali aa rahi pradhanmantri krishi vikaas yojana ko bhi 5,400 karod ru
 Given
 desh main jal sansaadhan kaa vikaas karne ke liye pehle se chali aa rahi yojanaon ko motaa fund dekar yah sanket die gaye hai ki abhi modi sarkaar kii yojanaon ke paanv jamane baaki hai
 On the other hand, the famous Make in India, National Industrial Corridor, Start Up, Stand Up India and National Health Protection Scheme has been allocated Rs 2,000 crore
 se kam kaa bajet aavantit hua he
 Digital India has a budget of Rs 2,000 crore
 se thodaa hi adhik he
 At the same time, Khelo India received just Rs 216 crore
 mili
 The biggest slap was the smart city scheme
 ise atal mishan for rijuvination and urban transformation (eemaruti) ke saath milakar 7,296 karod ru
 Allocated jabaki in donon pariyojnaon ko puraa karne ke liye paanch saal main kam se kam ek lakh karod ru
 Need an amount of yah mishan manmohan sarkaar main jawaharlal nehru rashtriya shahari navinikaran mishan (jeenenyuarem) kii jagah lene ke liye banaaya gaya, lekin bajet aavanton bahut kam rahaa
 In 2013, JNNURM received Rs 14,833 crore
 aavantit kiye gaye the
 Low crawler buses and BRT corridors were built under this mission in most cities of the country
 darasal, sarkaar ne kisaan hit kaa jo puraa khaakaa is bajet main khinchaa he, vah manmohan sarkaar ke jamaane kii yojanaon ke khambhon par tana he
 Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) where Rs 38,500 crore
 ke aavanton ke saath awwal rahi, vahiin pradhanmantri gram sadak yojana (pimgsavai) ke 19,000 karod ru
 He made a lot of headlines
 udhar, manmohan sarkaar ke samay ghotaalon kaa pratik ban gaye neshnal rural health mishan (enarechaem) ko modi sarkaar ne neshnal health mishan (enechaem) main badalakar ise 20,000 karod ru
 Allocation of pandit jawaharlal nehru, indira gandhi or rajeev gandhi ke naam par chalane vaali yojanaon se ye naam hataakar atal yaa deen dayaal upaadhyaay naam jodakar sarkaar ne acha-khaasaa aavanton kiya he
 Taking a dig at the return of the Manmohan era in the central government policy, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh says, "this budget only shows that the Modi government's thinking cannot go beyond the UPA government
" haa, ve hamaare kiye ko bhi eemaandaaree se aage nahin badha paa rahe
 "but at the policy level, the biggest reversal of the village-centric budget, which had returned four years back, was that it did not even mention the Prime Minister's MP Adarsh gram Yojana

 Speaking in a meeting two days ago, Modi had said that the government, which carried out digging on the basis of one's dreams, should bring back the black money of Indians in Swiss banks
 us kaale dhan kii keemat 1000 ton sone se zyada hogi
 This was seen as a mockery of Shobhan Sarkar's dream Narendra Modi has now praised Shobhan Sarkar in his tweet

 He said that i bow to his penance and sacrifice

 Shobhan Sarkar's aide Omji Baba said that the BJP is spending a lot of money on your branding as the Prime Minister

 'aapako bataa den ki bhartiya janata party ke mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey ke bete akaash vijayawargeey ne indore ke nagar nigam adhikari ko balla se peeta tha
 After this, Akash Vijayvargiya was arrested in the case
 haalanki court se reeha hone ke baad akaash vijayawargeey ne kaha tha ki unako apane kiye kaa koi pashchaatap nahin he
 Whatever he did, he did it thoughtfully

 i think that both Akash Vijayvargiya and the Municipal Commissioner are raw players
 yah itnaa bada mudda bhi nahin tha, lekin isko jaanboojhkar bada bana diya gaya he
 He also said that the officers should not have arrogance and they should talk to public representatives

 Blessed and proud to bring another strong girl into this world
 Tiana Gia Johnson came into this world like a force of nature and Mama @laurenhashianofficial labored and delivered like a true rockstar
 i was raised and surrounded by strong, loving women all my life, but after participating in baby Tia's delivery, it's hard to express the new level of love, respect and admiration i have for @laurenhashianofficial and all mamas and women out there
 Word to the wise gentlemen, it’s critical to be by your lady’s head when she’s delivering, being as supportive as you can
 
 holding hands, holding legs, whatever you can do
 But, if you really want to understand the single most powerful and primal moment life will ever offer - watch your child being born
 Its a life changer and the respect and admiration you have for a woman, will forever be boundless
 And to my third and youngest daughter, Tiana Gia - like i did when your two older sisters Simone Alexandra and Jasmine Lia were born, you have my word, I'll love, protect, guide and make ya laugh for the rest of my life 
 Your crazy dad has many responsibilities and wears many hats in this big ol’ world, but being your dad will always be the one I’m most proud to wear
 Oh and one more thing
 
 you're gonna love rollin 'in daddy's pick up truck

 china lagaataar bharat ko sikkim-bhutan border se apni sena hataane ko kah rahaa he, par bharat bhi sena naa hataane par ada he
 Meanwhile, BRICS is scheduled to have an NSA level meeting in Beijing
 ab china ne desh ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 China has alleged that Doval is the brain behind the border dispute in Doklam
 modi ke sabase khaas sipaahi maane jane vaale dobhaal ko lekar kisi desh ne aise bayaan diya he, aisa pehali baar nahin hua he
 Pakistan is always afraid of Doval called Indian James Bond
 yahaan padhein
 
 
 China's policy after Modi: Ever since Narendra Modi was sworn in as PM in 2014, he has been very attractive towards China
 sitambar 2014 main chini raashtrapati shi jinping ko piem modi ne bharat bulaayaa, or ahmedabad main jhula jhulaayaa tha
 It was then said that the PM wanted to entice China for investment, but after Modi's close association with America, China's attitude changed
 china ne baar-baar border par apane sainikon kii ghuspaith ke jariye bharat ko dhokhaa diya
 However, the Modi government continued to talk about this issue
 kya he dobhaal kaa role?ajit dobhaal narendra modi ke kareebi hai or kaaphi bharosemand bhi
 This is the reason why PM has completely handed over the issue of China to Doval
 china ke mudde par koi bhi baat hoti he to ajit dobhaal hameshaa active rahete hai
 Recently, Doval's role was very active during the controversy about Doklam
 kaha ja rahaa he ki dobhaal najar banaae hue hai
 This time on the border issue, the 20th talk will be held by the NSA of both countries in November last year
 border vivaad ko lekar 19veen baatcheet thi
 It was then decided that the border dispute of the two countries would be resolved soon by negotiation
 iske liye donon deshon ke bich 20veen baithak bharat main hogi
 The two countries together have formed a special committee to resolve the border dispute, through which the dispute can be resolved
 is samiti main ajit dobhaal ek mukhya sadsy hai
 Why China is afraid of Doval? China is bound to fear Ajit Doval
 dobhaal piem modi ke bharosemand hai, unhone china-pakistan jaise bade maamalon se nipatane ke liye unhen hi puri jimmedaari di he
 After Doval became the NSA, India's stance on security policy has become aggressive
 chaahe vah pakistan par sargical strike ho, yaa phir myanmar main ghuskar aatankiyon ko maarna
 On the issue of China too, India is aggressive this time and is not ready to bow down
 dobhaal kaa itihaas he china ke liye khatre kii ghantidrasal, ajit dobhaal bharat ke sarvshereshth spai main se ek rahe hai
 As an under cover agent of the intelligence agency RAW, Doval was a Pakistani Muslim in Lahore, Pakistan for 6 years
 iske alaava saal 2005 main ek tej tarraar khufia afasar ke rup main sthapit ajit dobhaal intelligence beuro ke diarector pad se ritair ho gaye
 In 2009, Ajit Doval became the Founder President of Vivekananda International Foundation
 is dauraan news paper main lekh bhi likhte rahe
 In 1989, Ajit Doval led 'operation Black Thunder' to expel extremists from the Golden Temple in Amritsar

 There is often a formal and informal interaction with the Sangh
 ’‘vot ke liye note’ maamle ko swatantra bharat kaa sabase bada ghotaalaa qaraar dete hue adwani ne kaha, ‘sansad main 'vot ke liye note' maamle ke ujagar hone ke samay main loksabhaa main vipaksh kaa netaa tha or is maamle ko ujagar karne ke liye maine hi apane saansadon ko anumati di thi, aise main yadi ye purv saansad doshi hai to unase bada main doshi hum

 a Lucknow police inspector who went behind bars on sight
 kaaran tha inspector kaa lav afaire, wo bhi kisi or se nahin balki apane hi vibhaag kii train mahila daroga ke saath, jise paane ke liye us inspector ne bun daalaa ek hatya kaa taana-bana or le lee ek maasoom kii jaan
 Innocent was just 14 years old and this innocent was none other than his girlfriend's brother
 aaropee inspector ne somvaar ko lakhanu main jila evam satr nyaayalay main sarmapan kar diya he jahaan se use chaudaa din ke liye nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya gaya he
 On May 29, a 14-year-old student was murdered in Faridipur in Indiranagar area
 maasoom ko ghar main ghuskar hatyaron ne goliyon se bhun diya tha
 When the Lucknow police revealed the murder of innocent Maj, the blood stains themselves were put on the uniform itself
 katl ke peeche kaa mastermind koi or nahin balki lakhanu kii human trephiking cell kaa prabharee inspector sanjay raay niklaa, jisane supaari dekar hatya karai
 In fact, when Sanjay Rai was in charge of Ghazipur police station in Lucknow about two-three years ago, during the investigation of a murder case, he met a woman, Daroga, who was training in the police department
 us hatya main ye mahila daroga bhi namjad thi
 During the investigation, Sanjay Rai had removed the name of the woman policeman from the case and helped him, after which the close relationship between the woman Daroga and Sanjay Rai increased and the love affair started in both
 kuch dinon tak sab kuch thik chalata rahaa lekin march 2013 main in donon ke bich kisi baat ko lekar vivaad ho gaya
 During this time, one day Sanjay came to know that the views of that woman daroga have increased considerably from the person named Akmal and Akmal also keeps visiting the house of the female daroga
 akmal se apni mahila mitra ke saath badhati nazdikyaan sanjay raay ko nagavar gujara or usne bana daalaa ek master plan
 According to this master plan, Sanjay believed that if any of the family members of the woman's wife's family were killed, then Akmal could be caught in the case of murder and throw his way out
 yahi vajah rahi ki inspector ne mahila ke parivaar main kisi shaks kii hatya karaane ke liye supaari de di or iske liye sanjay ne baqayda azamgarh va mau se bhaade ke paanch shootaron ko bulawaaya
 The day the shooter reached the house of the female inspector to carry out the incident, the innocent boy fell prey to the opening of the door
 maaj kii maut ke baad police ne jab maamle kii tafteesh shuru kii tab sanjay raay ne akmal ko is hatyakand main fansaane kii koshish karte huye puure police mahakme main ek afvaah failaa di ki maaj kaa hatyara akmal he lekin jaanch main police ne akmal ko doshi nahin paaya
 The police were also surprised after the murder of a 14-year-old innocent student
 police ke paas sabase bada sawaal ye tha ki aakhir maasoom maaj kii kisi se kya dushmani ho sakati he or uski hatya kisne or kyon kii
 So the police started investigating the case
 tafteesh ke dauraan police ko kuch aise saboot mili jo ye ishaara kar rahe the ki is hatya ko azamgarh ke kuch shootaron nen anjaam diya tha
 So the police arrested two shooters
 police nen jab shootaro kii kol detail nikaali to kol detail main sanjay raay kaa number bhi maujuud tha, jiske baad police ne sanjay raay kii bhi kol detail khangaali
 The number of shooters was present in Sanjay Rai's call detail, as well as another number was present, which was the number of days of Sanjay Rai
 police ne jab us number kaa pataa lagaaya to pataa chalaa ki ye number us mahila daroga kaa tha jo maaj kii chacheri bahan thi
 The police was now beginning to understand something about the matter
 police ne shootaron se jab kadi poochtacha kii tab shootaron ne saare raaj khol diye
 It was just a love affair
 beete 10 june ko police ne shootaron ko giraftaar kiya tha
 On that day it was revealed that the mastermind is Sanjay Rai, after which Sanjay was suspended and the police was looking for him because Sanjay Rai was in charge of many police stations and also in charge of the surveillance cell of Lucknow, he was a policeman
 Knew it well jin dino sanjay faraar tha usne ek sim se sirf ek hi baar apane karibiyon se baat kii or wo lagaataar jagah badal rahaa tha
 This inspector of the department made a lot of police disgrace
 lihaaja police isaki sargarmi se talash kar rahi thi lekin sanjay police ko chakma detaa ja rahaa tha, jiske baad police ko sanjay par paanch hajaar kaa inam ghoshit karnaa padaa lekin police kaa ye hatkandaa bhi fail sabit hua
 From start to finish, the police kept searching for Sanjay Rai and Sanjay used to dodge the police
 iske baad sanjay ne court main aatmasarmapan kii arji di or somvaar ko court main pesh hua, jahaan use 14 dinon kii nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya gaya

 To make a fighter, not only are the chickens kept away from the female hen, but they are also kept in the dark for several days

 The high-level certification screening committee in Chhattisgarh has rejected former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi's certificate of being Kanwar tribal
 is tarah se ajit jogi ab adivasee nahin rahe
 After this decision, the problems of Jogi can increase and his legislature is also facing trouble
 yahi vajah he ki ajit jogi ne is aadesh ko hai court main chunauti dene kaa faisla kiya he

 jogi ke anusuchit jati ke pramaan patr khaarij hone ke baad ab yah mana ja rahaa he ki yah marvaahee seat bhi unke haath se ja sakati he
 Marwahi seat is reserved for Scheduled Castes, due to which Ajit Jogi made this seat their stronghold
 yahi vajah rahi ki 2001 ke baad se yah vidhansabha seat jogi kii hokar rah gai
 Ajit Jogi continued to be an MLA from here in the 2003 and 2008 assembly elections
 2013 main amit jogi ne is seat ko chhod diya tha
 In the 2018 assembly elections, Ajit Jogi once again contested from Marwahi seat and managed to win by 46 thousand 462 votes despite the Congress wave
 lekin ab jogi ke adivasee jati pramaan patr khaarij hone ke baad unki marvaahee seat par sawaal khadey ho sakate hai or is tarah se unki vidhayaki bhi chhin sakati he
 Ajit Jogi told reporters that this decision is the decision of Bhupesh Baghel High Level Investigation Committee
 jogi ne kaha ki jab vah bhartiya prashasnic seva ke adhikari the tab tak unke khilaaf yah maamla nahin uthaa tha
 This matter came to light after joining politics
 jab vah rajyasabha ke liye chune gaye tab unki jati kaa mudda madhyapradesh ucch nyaayalay ke indore bench ke samaksh aayaa

 Like the last 2 years, this time there is no disturbance of any kind to the top officials of the Bihar Board
 yah sunishchit karne kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he kii pariksha kadachaar mukt ho

 During the inter-examination in the last days, it was seen that the biology and physics examination had gone viral before the commencement of the examination
 metric kii pariksha main exam shuru hone se pehle koi prashn patr whatsap par viral naa ho jaae isko lekar bhi board main intjaam kiya gaya he
 An FIR will be filed against those who forward any such message and then legal action will be taken

 This resulted in 65% of the candidates failing

 For the last several decades, Pranab Mukherjee alias Pranab da passed the political proposal of the Congress, in which the direct attack was on the RSS
 ab vahi pranab da RSS ke kaarykram main shaamil hone ke liye jane gaye to chot or dard congressiyon ko hona hi tha
 That is why a section of Congress kept reminding Sonia Gandhi in 2007 that she refused to leave despite an invitation in 2007 on the 100th birth anniversary of Guru Golwalkar, the head of the RSS
 pranab mukherjee jo bolaa, us par congress ne aresas par hamalaa bol diya
 But within the Congress, there is a long line of leaders who were against pledging to accept Pranab's departure
 lekin pranab da ke kad ko dekhte hue party ne rahul-sonia ke kehane par dada ke bhaashan tak aadhikarik taur par khaamoshi barti
 However, leaders like Anand Sharma, Ahmed Patel, Arjun Modhwadia personally questioned Dada's departure
 aakhir main dada ne bhaashan bhi de diya, bas yahi congress ne lapak liya
 Dada did not speak anything directly against anyone, but the Congress linked him to the RSS and explained that Dada made him face his truth
 kul milakar dada ne jo bhi kiya lekin, beti sharmishtha kaa twit, us par ahamed patel kaa likhnaa, phir anand sharma kaa hamalaa bataata he ki dada ne congress ke lihaaj se thik nahin kiya
 But in her speech, Dada spoke a lot, so the Congress is attacking the RSS with Dada from the front, but Dada's comment on Hedgewar has passed on him, on which she is silent, but knows and feels That Dada has given pain for a long time

 “27 agast kii raat 12
 At 30, you will see two moons in the sky
 lekin unamem se ek hi chand hoga
 The second will be Mars
 aisa nazaaraa phir 2287 tak nahin dikhegaa
 At the moment, none of the people alive in the world have ever seen this happen before
 ye sandesh is vakt email or whatsap par dhadlle se saajha kiya ja rahaa he
 The same message is being sent in whatsapp groups in languages other than English
 isse pehle ki aap bhi is khagoleey ghatana ko apni ankhon se dekhne ke liye sochane lagen to saavdhaan
 Do not believe this fake message
 na hi aapako raat der tak jaag kar akaash par takataki lagane kii jarurat he
 This is because nothing like this is going to happen in the sky
 na abhi or na aage bhi kabhi
 It seems that the factories spreading the rumors never get tired and spreading the same rumors year after year does not stop

 But strangely, this message has been going on for so many years and people still keep circulating it as true? The viral message claiming that Mars will come to Earth tonight (august 27) and look as big as Chand, is somewhat correct
 vastav main, nasa ke mutabik mangal pichley maheene 27 july se 30 july ke bich bhi itnaa hi dharti ke kareeb tha
 Then it was 576 lakh kilometers
 15 saal pehle kii baat kii jaae to 27 agast 2003 ko laal grih yani mangal prithvi ke asaadhaaran taur par kareeb yani 546 lakh kilometre kii duuri par aa gaya tha
 NASA said in a statement, "in 2003, Mars came closest to Earth in 60,000 years
 itnaa kareeb ab wo 2287 se pehle kabhi nahin aayega’
 In 2003, it looked 6 times larger and 85 times brighter than what it normally looks like
 lekin kya mangal dharti ke kareeb aane par hamen chand kii tarah bada dikh saktaa he? iskaa jawaab ‘nahin’ or takbhi nahin’ main he
 NASA has given a big warning on its website to educate and educate people about this rumor - 'don't be fooled by the rumor of Mars
 afvaah ye ki raat ko mangal aasmaan main chand kii tarah hi bada dikhegaa
 If this were true, we would have been in a lot of trouble due to the gravitational forces of Earth, Mars and Moon '
