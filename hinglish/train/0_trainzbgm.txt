 For the first time in the history of Gujarat, a large number of IPS officers reached the Chief Secretary of the state and complained that injustice was being done to them in the matter of progress in the state

 That is, if there is a meeting of IPS officers from all over the country in Delhi, most of the officers till 1990 will attend it as Additional DGP, but officers of the same batch of Gujarat as IG, and late promotions would have caused financial loss
 Is only ipies adhikariyon kii fariyaad he ki gujarat main pramotion kaa puraa dhaancha hi barbaad ho chukaa he

 He was SP, but as soon as he was released on bail, he was re-established with seniority and within a few days was promoted from SP to DIG and then IG, but in Gujarat, not only the accused officers, other untainted officers Even in the promotion is facing injustice
 sarkaar ne philhal inhen bharosa dilaayaa he ki is maamle main jald karrwai hogi or dhaancha durust kiya jayega, lekin adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki jab tak pramotion nahin milegaa, bharosa nahin lautega

 ) India also lost in the second group-d match played in Guam in World Cup qualifying
 group-di ke duusare match main guam ne bharat ko 2-1 se haraa diya
 Captain Sunil Chhetri scored the only goal for India
 captain chhetri ne injuri time main apane kariyar kaa 50waan gol kar itihaas to kaayam kiya, lekin isse match ke nateezon par koi asar nahin padaa
 In Group D, India now have to play matches against Iran and Turkmenistan
 tippaniyan Football expert Nuvvi Kapadia says, in my memory, this is India's worst defeat
 vah kehete hai ki bharat kii world ranking 141 he jabaki guam kii 174
 Indian players earn more than Rs
 Crore annually
 bharat kii jansankhya sava sau karod ke qareeb he, jabaki guam kii aabaadi dedh lakh se thodi zyaada he
 He says what more do you need to win from such a team? Nuvvie is reminiscent of a 2001 match against Brunei
 vah kehete hai ki us vakt bharat ne brunei ko bengalooru main 5-0 or phir brunei main khele gaye match main 4-0 se jeet hasil kii thi
 Nuvvi says that it does not matter whether Sunil Chhetri has scored the 50th goal (87 matches)
 zaahir he bhartiya footbaal team or coach steefan kanstantine ko bahut kaam karne kii or shaayad puri ranneeti par vichaar karne kii jarurat hogi
 Captain Chhetri made history by scoring his career's 50th goal in injury time, but this did not affect the results of the match
 group-di main bharat ko ab iran or turknamenistan ke khilaaf match khilne hai
 The comments footbal visheshgy nuvi kapadia kehete hai, meri yaaddaasht main ye bharat kii sabase buree haar he
 He says India's world ranking is 141 while Guam's 174
 bharat ke khilaadiyon ko karod rupee se zyaada salanaa kamai hoti he
 The population of India is close to 125 billion, while the population of Guam is slightly more than one and a half million
 vah kehete hai ki aisi team se bhi jeet ke liye aapako or kya chahie? nuvi 2001 main brunei ke khilaaf hue match kii yaad dilaate hai
 He says that at that time India won Brunei 5–0 in Bengaluru and then 4–0 in the match played in Brunei
 nuvi kehete hai ki sunil chhetri ne 50waan gol (87 match) kiya he yaa nahin isse fark nahin padataa
 It is obvious that the Indian football team and coach Stephen Constantine will need to do a lot of work and perhaps consider the whole strategy

 vaigyanikon kaa kahana he ki yah surya ke najadik ke ek behad chamkile taare (red dwarf) ke chaaron taraf chakkar kaat rahaa he or kareeb 33 prakaash varsh dur he
 The 'GJ536B' is not in the wiring residential area but 8

 However, the possibility of life on Super Earth is not yet known

 But the speed of light is 670 billion miles per hour and the fastest unmanned spacecraft ever built is 'new Horizon' which runs at a speed of 35 thousand mph

 Indian pilgrims will conduct visa-free movement through this
 shraddhaluon ko kartarpur sahib jane ke liye sirf ek permit lenaa hoga
 The corridor will be opened in November in view of 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev, the founder of Sikhism

 ek duusare ke dhur virdohi maane jane vaali bijepi or aam aadmi party ne kya emsidi main ek duusare se haath mila liya he
 This question is arising because Aam Aadmi Party candidates won the post of president and vice-president in the election of City SP zone held on Thursday
 lekin sthaayee samiti sadsy ke liye bijepi ke ummidavaar ne baaji maari
 Surprisingly, the candidates received 11–11 votes for all three positions
 yahaan aam aadmi party ke 8 sadsy the to vahiin bijepi ke 3 or congress ke 6 sadsy the
 Aam Aadmi Party councilor Mohammad Sadiq was elected to the post of president of the City and Sadar Paharganj ward committee elections with 11 votes out of a total of 17 votes
 yahaan unhone congress ummidavaar prerana singh ko haraaya jinhen 6 vot mili jabaki bijepi ke ravindra kumaar ne chunaav purv apana namakan waapas le liya tha
 Jaikishan Goyal of Aam Aadmi Party was also elected on the post of Vice President in the zone
 unhen bhi 11 vot mili jabaki congress ke sulakshana ko 6 vot mili
 On the other hand, Avatar Singh of BJP was elected to the standing committee member defeating Seema Tahira of Congress
 inhen bhi 17 main se 11 vot hasil hue jabaki aap ke rakesh kumaar ne chunaav purv apana namakan waapas le liya tha
 Out of total 17 votes, Congress had 6 votes while BJP had 3 and AAP had 8 votes
 aise main aap ke 8 or bijepi ke 3 voton ko milane par sankhya 11 hoti he jo ki adhyaksh, upaadhyaksh or sthaayee sadsy ke ummidavaaron ko mili vot kii sankhya he
 This means that the BJP and AAP have joined hands here
 congress ne bolaa hamlacongress netaa mukesh goyal ne kaha ki vaise to bijepi or aap ek duusare ke dushman banate hai lekin ek pad ke liye gale mil gaye jo bataane ke liye kaaphi he ki ye partiyaan kisi bhi had tak gir sakati hai
 BJP and AAP leaders may not say anything openly but the votes received by their candidates make it clear that BJP and Aam Aadmi Party have joined hands in the City SP zone

 There is nothing inflammatory in his speech

 'we saw the CD, the officials also watched' The Home Minister further said, 'we have seen the CD and our officials have also seen it
 isamen kuch bhi aisa nahin dikhaa, jisamen koibhadakau bhaashandiya gaya ho
 If they had given the speech, the Agra police would have acted on them

 'aatankwaad ke mudde par kendriya mantri ne kaha ki aatank kaa koi dharm nahin hota, koi rang nahin hota
 Reacting to the accusations against the opposition over the provocative speech, Rajnath Singh said that communal harmony cannot be weighed with any political advantage or disadvantage
 main hoti to katheria jail main hote: mayavatidusri ore, bispi pramukh mayawati ne katheria ke mudde par endie sarkaar or upi kii akhilesh sarkaar ko nishane par liya
 He said, 'there is no doubt that ever since the NDA government was formed, people sitting on constitutional post have been giving communal speeches
 katheria kaa bayaan khatarnaak he
 They should be dismissed
 upi sarkaar koi karrwai nahin kiya he
 The state government should file a sedition case against them
 'mayawati ne aage kaha ki agar upi main unki sarkaar ko hoti to ramshankar katheria jail kii salaakhon ke peeche hote
 He said that during his tenure his government had acted on Varun Gandhi

 mashhoor shaayar raahat indori ne pakistan kaa nyotaa thukraa diya he
 Rahat Indauri was invited to join an international Mushaira
 raahat ke alaava unke bete satluj raahat ne bhi pakistan jane se inkaar kar diya
 a Mushaira is being organized on March 22 in Karachi, the city of Mushairapakistan in Karachi
 is mushaayare main shaamil hone ke liye duniya bhar ke namchin shaayaron ko nyotaa bheja gaya he
 In this episode, invitation was also sent to Rahat Indauriko
 lekin unhone pakistan jane se saaf inkaar kar diya
 This is why the denial, however, is quite surprising because of the refusal of Indori
 unase jabpakistan jaakar mushayaremen shaamil na hone kaa sawaal poocha gaya to unhone koi pukhta jawaab nahin diya
 Rahat explained his reasons for not going to Pakistan
 dilli sarkaar ne apane mantriyon kii videsh yatraaon par lakhon rupee kharch kar die
 In response to an RTI, the Delhi government itself has admitted that three ministers have traveled abroad eight times and the government has borne the expenses
 aath videsh yatraaon par kharch hue 40 lakhaam aadmi party ke mantri videshon kaa daura kar rahe hai or wo bhi sarkari kharch par
 Shocking information is that three ministers spent nearly four million rupees on eight foreign trips
 activist or bijepi ke netaa vivek garg ne dilli sarkaar se mantriyon kii videsh yatraaon or un par hue sarkari kharch kaa byora maanga tha
 According to RTI, Satyendra Jain went abroad thrice between 2015 and 2016, according to RTI
 isamen manchester, sweden or malaysia kii yatra shaamil he
 It also included Ashish Khaitan in his trip to Manchester
 teen din kii isvidesh yatrapar 783403 rupee kharch hue
 While traveling to Sweden and Malaysia cost around five lakh rupees
 gopal raay kii iklauti videsh yatra par bhi kareeb chaar lakh rupye kharch hue
 He had gone to Sweden on a foreign trip, the expenses incurred on foreign travel also exceeded the RTI report, as well as Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has gone abroad for four times in a year and a half according to RTI
 isamen london, australia, germany kii yatra shaamil he
 More than nine lakhs have been spent on a trip by Manish Sisodiyaki
 artiai daakhil karne vaale vivek garg ke mutabik mantriyon kii videsh yatra par hua kharchaa artiai main mili jawaab se bhi kahin zyada he
 Because the Delhi government has hidden all the information about the foreign travel of ministers
 vivek garg kaa ye bhi aarope he ki mantriyon ke saath gaye staff or sarkari delygation ke naam par gaye party kaaryakartaaon par hue kharche ko bhi sarkaar ne chupa liya he
 The Aam Aadmi Party gave a clarification when PWD Minister Satyendar Jain of Delhi Government was questioned on the expenses incurred on foreign trips, his argument was also interesting
 satyendra jain ke mutabik mantri ghoomane phirane nahin balki sarkari kaam se videsh yatra par gaye the
 The foreign visits of ministers of his government are much shorter than the ministers of other states
 in videsh yatraaon main mukhyamantri kii videsh yatraaen shaamil nahin he
 Also, the expenses of minister Satyendar Jain's visit to the Vatican with the Chief Minister is not included
 videsh yatraaon kii filon par alji daftar kii najrahaalanki ab videsh yatraaon par alji daftar ne bhi najar tedhi kar lee he
 LG has sought information about the foreign visits of ministers
 sutron ke mutabik mantriyon kii videsh yatraaon se judi filon ko bhi alji kii gathit kii gai teen sadasyeey cameti jaanch rahi he
 According to sources, it is also being investigated whether the expenditure on foreign trips was approved by the LG

 bihar main bhartiya janata party or uske sahyogi dalon janata dal united (jediu) or lok janashakti party (algepi) ke bich siton kaa bantwaaraa ho gaya he
 On Sunday, BJP president Amit Shah said that his party will contest 17 seats, Nitish Kumar's JDU also 17 and Ram Vilas Paswan's LJP 6 seats
 agar pichley chunaav kii baat kii jaae to bijepi nuksaan main najar aa rahi he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP contested 29 seats and LJP 7 seats
 isamen se bijepi ne 22 or algepi ne 6 siton par jeet darj kii thi
 Whereas JDU fought 38 seats separately from NDA and it won only 2 seats
 aise main ab sawaal uth rahe hai ki do saansadon vaali jediu kaa 22 saansadon vaali bijepi ke baraabar siton par chunaav ladanaa kiski kamajori or majbootee ko dikhaata he?aisa sawaal par bihar main netaa vipaksh or rashtriya janata dal ke vidhayak tejasvi yadav ne bhi uthaaya he, lekin unhone isse aage badhate hue puure endie ko hi kamjor bataaya he
 Describing the condition of the alliance of BJP and its allies thin in view of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Tejaswi wrote, `` Despite the mandate theft, BJP has become so strong in Bihar that despite having 22 sitting mps, it will contest 17 seats and 2 MP Nitish Zee will also contest on 17 seats
 ab samaj jaaiye NDA ke kitne patale halaat hai
 Apart from this assessment of Tejashwi, another picture has emerged from the seat formula that BJP has suffered a big loss compared to 2014
 jabaki ramvilas paswan apana purana rutaba barkaraar main kaamyaab rahe hai
 LJP and JDU got the benefit of asking questions on demonetisation from Prime Minister Modi after 2 years
 😊janadesh chori ke baad bhi BJP bihar main itani majboot hui ki 22 vartmaan saansad hone ke baavjood 17 seat par chunaav ladegi or 2 MP vaale nitish ji bhi 17 seat par ladenge
 Now understand how thin the nda's situation is- Tejashwi Yadav (@yadavtejashwi) December 23, 2018 After the stunning RLSP president Upendra Kushwaha, who quit the NDA and joined the Grand Alliance, also quipped on seat sharing

 At the same time, JDU President Nitish Kumar, who is holding the power of the state, expressed confidence in him even better than 2009 elections

 Book Name: Your Dreams Are Mine Now Author: Ravinder Singh Translation: Prabhat ranjanbook Cover: Paper Back Price: Rs 150 Operating: *** Sapna is seen by everyone
 kisi kaa sapana hota he kuch bada karne kaa, samaaj ko badalane kaa or duniya ke liye kuch aisa karne kaa ki aapke jane ke baad bhi log aapako yaad rakhen
 But is it so easy to fulfill these dreams? No, it is not so easy
 lekin lekhak ravinder singh ne apni nai kitaab tumhaare sapane hue apane main is mudde ko bahut khubsuurati se piroyaa he
 Your dreams are your story of Rupali and Arjun, of friendship and love between the two
 jindagi ko lekar donon kaa najariya bilkul alag he
 Rupali is a girl from Patna, the capital of Bihar, who is admitted to Delhi University
 dilli uniwarsity main admician paanaa uskaa sapana tha or usne iske liye kadi mehnat bhi kii thi
 But what Rupali knew was that after admission in Delhi University, her life would change completely
 arjuna dilli kaa ladkaa he or youth politics main uskaa shuru se interest he
 a scandal takes place on the college campus
 jiske baad se rupali or arjuna kareeb aate hai
 There is friendship between the two and then love
 lekin pyaar kii shuruyaat scandle ke saath hoti he or iske baad donon dilli uniwarsity kii raajnneeti main ulajhate hai
 How does Rupali get entangled in Delhi politics and can Arjun support her every step? If you have read Ravinder Singh's i Too Had a Love Story, Can Love Happen Twice, then this is also a good love story in this series
 kyon padhein: agar lav stories padhanaa acha lagata he to is kitaab ko jarur padhein
 If there is a book by Ravinder Singh, then get relaxed because you will not be bored
 bor ho rahe hai or koi lite si lav story padhane kaa man he to is kitaab ko jarur padhein
 Why not read: The biggest drawback of the book is that the balance between Delhi politics and love is not very good
 kitaab main raajnneeti ko bas becoground main istemaal kiya gaya he jabaki pyaar ko bahut achche se samajhaayaa gaya he

 The trial in this case lasted for two years
 In June this year, the court had ruled that the Delhi government was constantly late in buying DTC buses, there were many reasons
 jisamen se ek dilli hai court main lagi yachika bhi thi
 The petition challenged the Delhi government's decision to purchase 2000 standard floor buses
 2 saal tak is maamle main sunwaayee chali or isi saal june main court ne apana faisla suna diya
 The petition was filed by advocate Nipun Malhotra, stating that the Delhi government is going to buy standard floor buses instead of low-floor buses, disregarding the disabled
 is maamle main yachikakarta ne nipun malhotra kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ne lo floor bas aage khareednaa munasib nahin samajha, jo viklang ke liye istemaal karnaa aasaan tha
 There was no need for the Delhi government to purchase standard floor buses, but after this decision of the government always challenged this order because these buses were going to increase the problems of the disabled
 yah yachika nipun malhotra dwaara 2017 main lagaai gai thi, jis par dilli hai court ne isi saal june main apana aadesh sunaaya
 The government ordered to buy 1000 standard floor buses on the condition that it will erect ramps for all those buses with disabilities
 iske alaava dilli hai court ne kaha ki baaki 1000 basen dilli sarkaar ko lo floor kii hi kharidni hogi
 Earlier in 2015, the Supreme Court had directed the Delhi government that DTC should have 10,000 buses according to the population of Delhi
 lekin 4 saal bitne ke baad bhi public transport main dilli sarkaar behatar sthiti main nahin he
 DTC currently has about 5000 buses in Delhi
 yani jitani jarurat he uski aadhi basen hi philhal dilli sarkaar public transport ke liye janata ko muhaiyaa kara paa rahi he
 When the government's decision to buy standard floor buses was challenged in the court, the court also asked the government the same question whether the roads of Delhi are suitable for bringing thousands of new buses
 court kaa yah bhi sawaal tha ki dilli main jahaan har roj trephic jam kii samasya vikaraal rup leti ja rahi he vahaan par nai basen or kharid kar kya dilli sarkaar itnaa infrastracchar taiyaar kar paaegi jisase vaaki in bason ko chalaane or khadi karne kii vyavastha sarkaar ke paas ho
 No candidate from Lucknow Cantt seat has been named in Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's candidate list for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 yah baat isliye ahm he, kyonki samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya or mukhyamantri ke pita mulaayam singh yadav ne yah seat apane chote bete pratik kii patni aparnaa yadav ke liye tay kar rakhi he
 Mulayam Singh Yadav had declared 26-year-old Aparna Yadav a candidate of Samajwadi Party from Lucknow Cantt seat almost a year ago
 aparnaa ko mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke chachaa shivpal yadav ke camp kii sadsy mana jaataa he, jinke saath takat ko lekar chal rahi akhilesh kii jang ne party main 'dophaad' kar daalaa he
 In this quarrel, Mulayam Singh Yadav has so far fully supported his brother, and Akhilesh Yadav's supporters allege that the party chief's second wife and the chief minister's step mother have incited Mulayam Singh Yadav against Akhilesh
 akhilesh yadav ke in samarthako kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki aparnaa yadav kii rajnatik mahatvakanksha akhilesh yadav ke sthaan par samaajawaadee party kaa yuva cheharaa banane or phir shaayad vakt ke saath mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar banane kii bhi he
 a few months ago, the ongoing war between Akhilesh and Shivpal was at its peak, and became public when MLA Udayveer Singh, considered close to Akhilesh Yadav, wrote to Mulayam Singh Yadav saying that his family members were targeting the chief minister
 Huh
 ise mulaayam kii patni kii ore ishaara samajha gaya, jisase mulaayam kaaphi naaraaz hue
 Aparna Yadav is a frequent figure in Lucknow Cantt constituency, but currently Rita Bahuguna Joshi is the MLA from this seat
 samaajawaadee party ne lakhanu seat kabhi nahin jiti he
 Sources say that Aparna had first demanded a safe seat for the Samajwadi Party to contest the elections, but had to compromise on the Lucknow Cantt seat, and since then she has been campaigning there
 tippaniyan As easily as Akhilesh Yadav's MP wife Dimple Yadav got a chance to make a political career, it is said that Aparna had a problem in her mind, because according to Aparna she had to work a lot harder than Dimple
 aparnaa ke pati pratik fitness bijnes main hai, or rajnatik rup se zyaada sakriy nahin hai, lekin akhilesh yadav gut kaa aarope he ki bade bhai or pita ke bich khai paidaa karne main unki bhi bhoomika rahi he
 Aparna Yadav had earlier hit the headlines for openly supporting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Aparna and her husband Prateek also took a selfie with the Prime Minister on the occasion of Mulayam Singh Yadav's grandson's wedding in Mainpuri in 2015

 These supporters of Akhilesh Yadav also believe that Aparna Yadav's political ambition is to become the young face of the Samajwadi Party in place of Akhilesh Yadav and then perhaps in time to become the chief ministerial candidate
 kuch maheene pehle akhilesh or shivpal ke bich jari jang charam par thi, or us samay saarvajanik ho gai, jab akhilesh yadav ke kareebi maane jane vaale vidhayak udaiveer singh ne mulaayam singh yadav ko likhakar kaha ki unke parivaar ke hi sadsy mukhyamantri ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 This was understood to be a gesture towards Mulayam's wife, which caused Mulayam to become very angry
 aparnaa yadav lakhanu cant vidhansabha kshetra main lagaataar dikhti rahati hai, lekin philhal is seat se reeta bahuguna joshi vidhayak hai
 The Samajwadi Party has never won the Lucknow seat
 sutron kaa kahana he ki aparnaa ne pehali baar chunaav ladane ke liye samaajawaadee party ke lihaaz se surakshit seat kii maang kii thi, lekin lakhanu cant seat par samjhauta karnaa padaa, or tabhi se vah vahaan prachaar kar rahi hai
 The comments akhilesh yadav kii saansad patni dimple yadav ko jitani aasaani se rajnatik kariyar banane kaa mauka mil gaya, bataaya jaataa he ki aparnaa ke man main usase khatas paidaa ho gai, kyonki aparnaa ke mutabik unhen dimple kii tulana main bahut zyaada mehnat kerani padi
 Aparna's husband Prateek is in a fitness business, and is not politically active, but the Akhilesh Yadav faction alleges that he has also played a role in creating a rift between his elder brother and father

 uttar pradesh main muradabad jile ke kanth maamle main adaalat ne ab nayaa farmaan suna diya he
 The Allahabad High Court rejected the PIL filed seeking the installation of a loudspeaker on the temple at Nayagaon Akbarpur Chenderi in Kanth, saying that the district administration has the authority to decide it
 hoicourt ke nyaayadhish nyaayamurti dilip gupta va nyaayamurti emasi treepathi kii khandpeeth ne is yachika par mangalvaar ko apana nirnay surakshit kar liya tha
 On Saturday, the court gave its verdict on the petition filed by Chunu Singh and 10 others
 yachika main maang kii gai he ki laudspikar lagane kii anumati di jaae
 The petitioners had urged the court to allow them to play devotional songs on loudspeakers at least one hour each morning and evening in Lord Shiva's temple
 unhone aagrah kiya tha ki unke gaanv main puja kaa ekmaatr sthaan vah mandir he or ve log vahaan pichley 40 saal se bhi adhik samay se puja karte aa rahe hai
 However, the court was of the opinion that it is not permissible to allow the use of loudspeakers without the permission of the district administration and the Regional Pollution Control Board
 adaalat ne kaha ki log apni maang ko lekar sambhddha praadhikari se sampark kar sakate hai or jo bhi nirnay kiya jaae vah ‘dhwani pradooshan niyaman va niyantran niyamavali, 2000’ ke praavdhaanon ke anuroop ho
 At the same time, the court said that police stations should ensure that there are no loudspeakers or other sound generating activities in their jurisdiction

 While disposing of the PIL, the court said that the right to freedom from noise pollution is a fundamental right, which cannot be allowed to be violated

 But now it has come to the conclusion that in almost all the big cases, the Delhi government and LG have different lawyers for the police side and due to the different opinions of the two lawyers, the hearing of important cases is either postponed or Stay on hearing nateeja dilli kii is ladaai main aam janata kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 To advocate for a case, two lawyers in the court, in fact, Lipika Mitra, wife of Somnath Bharti, had filed a petition about 5 months ago to dismiss her husband's bail
 lekin abhi hai court somnath kii jamaanat par kuch tay kare usase pehle donon kevakilon main is baat ko lekar ladayeechal rahi he ki dilli police kaa paksh is maamle main koun rakhe
 The angry court said that in a week they will decide for themselves who will be the prosecution lawyer in this case
 Apart from this, dozens of cases are pending only in the High Court, on which no decision has been made as the conflict of lawyers is constantly increasing in the court

 Be it Jintendra Tomar's fake degree case or the fight of the ACB to subdue the Delhi government, the fight of the lawyers to stop the illegal construction of Jarnail Singh was clear in the court
 dilli sarkaar ke cirkil rate ko tay karne ko lekar bhi maamle hai court main atka hua he
 Seeing this fight in the CNG fitness scam, the court has put a stay on the hearing
 JNU maamle main kanhaiya ko jamaanat mili yaa nahin isko lekar LG ke niyukt vakil jahaan jamaanat kaa virodh kar rahe the, vahiin dilli sarkaar ke standing council use jamaanat die jane par apni sahmati jataa rahe the
 According to the law, the Supreme Court ordered to settle the case soon, the land, law and order and police center are under
 dilli ko abhipurn rajyaka darja nahin mila he
 Whereas the Delhi Government states that it is not accountable to the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Home Affairs does not have the authority to rescind the Delhi Government's order
 keval court ko aisa adhikaar praapt he or court donon ke jhagade or vakeelon kii adla-badali main samay par koi faisla nahin kar paa rahaa he
 However, the Supreme Court has given instructions that the High Court should complete the hearing of the pending cases related to this case by 31 July

 The story of the film Singh Sahab the Great opens with the pen of a journalist and how the collector of a small town in Uttar Pradesh falls prey to politicians and goons
 apni bivi ko khota he or rishwat ke jhuthe ilzaam main jail jaataa he lekin jail se aane ke baad voh singh sahab banakar bhrashtachar ke kilaaf ladaai ladata he aam aadmi kaa jhanda lekar jise aaj arvind kejariwal raajnneeti ke maidan main lekar utre hue hai
 Sunny Deol, who gave many memorable action films in the 90s, can once again return to his genre where his avatar is Angryman
 bhrashtachar ke kilaaf ladaai ladata he
 There are a lot of dialogues and many beautiful action sequences
 sani deol jab prakaash raaj ko apane haath se dabaate hai tab haddi ke kadakadaane kii awaz aati he jo sani par suut karata he
 Sunny Deol has given successful films like Apne and Ghadar with director Anil Sharma and the director-actor chemistry in this film is also good
 film main sani deol ne shashakt kirdaar nibhaayaa he vahiin prakaash raaj ne vilan ke role main jaan daali he
 For a long time, Sunny had not come out with such a film as her image and he was often seen doing comedy
 magar ab jab bollywood main ek baar phir ection or masala filmon kaa daur shuru ho gaya aise main sani kii ection main vaapasi jaays he
 Singh Sahab cannot separate The Great from Bollywood masala films as it has action, drama, emotion and a bit of comedy
 singh sahab da great ek hard hiting film he jisamen romance kaa angel thodaa atapata lagata he
 At the script level, the film seems a bit stretched and long but fans of Sunny's fans and action films will love this film as Sunny has fought against corruption in his own way
 film main ek kuubasurat sandesh bhi he jisamen kaha gaya he ki bura aadmi isliye zulm nahin karata kyonki vah taaqatvar he balk isliye kyonki achche log ek saath hokar apni taaqat kaa istemaal nahin karte
 So my rating for this film is 3 stars

 baat hote hote gandhi ji tak pahunchi
 Called
 gaya padho kya likhaa he
 Gandhiji listened
 phir kaha, isamen to kharabi nahin he
 So Babuji survived
 9
 How to write if you do not drink babu ji ne likhaa he
 Kayasthas are born in total
 jo ki pine ke liye mashhoor hai
 When Prithviraj Chauhan was blinded and brought to the court of Shahabuddin Gauri and said to play the word-wielding arrow, Chandbardai read a verse
 alag alag jati ko agar pradhan banaaya jaae to vyavhaar kaisaa hoga
 So Babu ji wrote that if he makes Kshatriya as head, he will eat and show the sword
 baniyaa banegaa to ghar bharegaa, raaj kisi or de degaa, kysth pradhan banegaa to din bhar peetaa rahegaa
 10
 ise sun babu ji ne likhaa tha ki main kysth kulodbhav, mere purakhon ne itnaa dhaala ki, mere tan ke lohu main he 75 pratishat haalaa
 11
 mere shav par wo roe, ho jiske aansu main haalaa, aah bhare wo jo ho surabhit, madiraa pikar madhushaala
 12
 madhushaala bahut prachlit rahi
 Babuji's work was in great detail
 padhaate the english litarechar
 He did his phd from Cambridge
 prakhyat irish kavi yeats par doctoret kii
 Four years work done in two years13
 dukh he ki babu ji ke saath kam vakt mila
 His mind would get more time to understand things
 ab yaad aata he, jab padhata hum
 14
 aajkal dekhte hai ki sab bhagdaud kii jindagi he
 Babu ji has written that in the catastrophe of life, when you got time, you can sit and think for a while, what you did, said, what you have done
 
 
 15
 In our era
 1958 kii baat kar rahaa hum
 There was such an atmosphere in the house that the boy was schooled
 tab graduate hona badi cheez thi
 Today's youth tell at the age of five six what to do
 or yahaan to bade cricketer baithe hai
 Senior Cambridge, then graduated from DU
 phir naukari khoji to kahin mili nahin
 There used to be friction
 to sab saathi dilli ke coffee house main baithkar koste the
 We used to say that the fault is not ours
 galati hamaare mata pita kii he
 Why was born? mujhe laga ki ye bahut sahi baat bol rahaa he
 For the first time in life, i spoke to Babuji in a loud voice
 maine kaha, vajah pataa chal gai
 Why did you produce me babuji shant rahe
 Did not say anything
 ham us vakt willingdon kriscent main rahete the
 Babu ji used to go for a walk at 4 in the morning
 tab biabaan hota tha vahaan
 Babu ji started going in the morning
 mujhe uthaate the padhane ke liye
 He left the paper on the bed
 us par ek choti kavita thi
 Wrote the answer to the night's question
 jindagi or jamaane kii kashmakash se ghabaraakar mere bete mujhase poochhate hai ki mujhe paidaa kyon kiya tha
 i have no answer except that my father also produced me without asking me
 
 
 tum hi nai li rakhana
 Ask your sons to produce them
 16
 There was a little stagnation and fear in my relationship with Babuji
 nirantar kamare main baith vah likhte the
 Discipline was prohibited
 zyada baat nahin hoti thi
 When something big happened, it happened
 unke bahut se gun the
 i was in Sherwood College, in Nainital
 vahaan ek saal drama kiya to best actor aword mila
 The second year was also expected to win the trophy
 magar parformens ke do din pehle mujhe khasra ho gaya
 The parents were there with me in the hospital
 ve teen chaar ghante mujhase baat karte rahe
 Then Babu ji spoke of virtue
 ki man kaa ho to acha, na ho to zyada acha
 i did not understand
 poocha, to vah bole ki man kaa nahin ho rahaa, to upar vaale ke man kaa ho rahaa he, or vah tumhaare liye kabhi bura nahin chahega
 17
 bahut sari baaten hai puri raat nikal jaaegi babu ji kii baton main18
 When married, i thought if i had a son, he would be my friend
 abhishek ko maine hameshaa apana dost mana he
 Have read in the book
 pakistan ke upar thi
 There is a saying
 betaa jab baap ke juute pahan letaa he
 Then he is not a son but a friend
 ab abhishek meri pant kot sab pahan lete hai
 They also wear shoes
 main unki chijen churaataa hum
 Friend has a feeling
 babu ji ke saath alag tha
 19
 babu ji sarkaar main naukari karte the
 Many times the means to run a house could not be completed
 kai baar vah raat biraat kavi sammelan main jate
 Returning at 3 o'clock in the night
 subah daftar jate
 i would open the door
 main kahata, kya karte hai aap, itani der
 He would say, son gets money and hard work
 phir main industry main aa gaya
 Performs three shifts
 subah chah baje lautataa
 Babu ji would open the door
 bolte, ye koi vakt he aane kaa
 i would say, Babuji, money is very difficult
 20
 i can't write kabhi is tarah kii budtamiji sochi bhi nahin
 Yes, i reach everywhere on time and read the script hard
 beti shweta likh rahi hai akhbaar main kollam
 i like reading 21
 Shahrukh Khan says for my family that SAB Bachchan stays tip top in the family
 magar vah khud bhi to tip top rahete hai
 22
 wasim akram bole, india se zyada fain aapke pakistan main, hamane teen maheene ke intjaar ke baad aapaki film kaaliya dekhi
 Will give a message for them
 23
 Bachchan said, i have a family relationship
 meri mata sikh parivaar se hai
 He is born in Faisalabad (pakistan)
 padhai lahore kii he
 Nana lived there
 jab do saal kaa tha
 So she was taken there
 zyada yaad nahin
 But know that there is a lot of love
 un sabko bahut bahut shukriya
 24
 jab main kuli kii shooting main ghayal hua tha
 At that time, the number of prayers offered to India were as much as Pakistan
 yaad he ek khaas vakya
 a small child lived in a small village in Pakistan
 vah har roj 15 kimi daudkar shahar aata tha akhbaar kii khabar dekhne ke liye ki meri tabiyat kisi he
 Then used to go back
 ye mere upar ek karj he
 i want it to remain unheen duaaon ke sahare aapke saamne baitha hum
 Thank you very much to my fans in Pakistan
 kya kahen 
 25
 babul supriyo kaa sawaal
 What a singer can do to gain a base of voice like yours
 plis, apana sikret share kar den
 26
 bachchan kaa sawaal
 Honorary, the answer will have to be asked to Babuji
 meri paidaaish unki he
 Who got from birth
 use hi prastut kar rahaa hum
 Did not do any special program
 27
 Sometimes i think in my heart
 jindagi teri julfon ke naram chhaanv main guzarati to shaadaab ho bhi sakati thi
 28
 nila aasmaan so gaya
 Story of this song
 is gane kii dhun mujhe shammi kapur sahab se mili
 We have a family relationship with them now
 shammi ne hameshaa bahut pyaar diya
 We were doing a film
 jameer ke naam se
 If there was an opportunity in the evening during the shooting, we would sit in the evening
 ek dhun gunagunaate
 This is a Himachali tune
 vah gaate the
 When the sequence was being made
 to mujeec sitting ke dauraan baat ho rahi thi yash ji ke saath
 Hari Shiva was thinking the tune
 maine unhen bataaya
 Sang unhen pasand ai
 Then went to Shammi ji
 bataaya
 Asked for permission unhone hami bhar di
 29
 kya chhod kar jaaoongaa
 Do not understand anything ye nahin chahta ki abhishek mere dialog bole, gane gaae
 Just assume that i was a good person
 acha mitra tha, itnaa kaaphi he
 30
 mere najar main mere parivaar kii best film- ye sawaal poocha gaya he
 But i have to return home to Mumbai at night
 or bhookha ja rahaa hum
 Will be cocky
 agar kuch bolaa to
 However 31
 jaya kii jitani filmein raheen, acchhee raheen
 The atmosphere of his selection was beautiful
 unako tasalli nahin hoti kahani main, to vah karti nahin hai
 Received abhimaan, piya kaa ghar, guddi, sab acchhee hai
 Aishwarya had just requested with Hrithik
 unka abhinay acha laga
 Abhishek looked good in the film Guru, Mani Ratnam's film
 32
 Was the most important moment of my life
 jab maine shakti main dilip kumaar sahab ke saath kaam kiya
 He has been regarded as a superhero since childhood
 jab film industry kaa itihaas likhaa jayega, to hameshaa hoga bifor dilip kumaar or after dilip kumaar
 33
 adbhut tha dilip sahab ke saath kaam karnaa
 i would never like Shakti to be a remake
 34
 Politics was a passionate occasion for me
 usamen pravesh ke baad pataa chalaa ki bhavakuta or raajnneeti alag alag hai
 That's why i gave up
 ab waapas nahin jaaoongaa
 35
 ek mushkil vakt tha
 Attachment was attached
 diwalia ho gaya tha
 There were around 100 cases
 kai log jo ek jamaane main kaam karnaa chaahate the
 They used to come and abuse
 dhamkiyaan dete the
 To get out of all these dilemmas i thought, what to do
 itani pareshaaniyaan hai
 Could not sleep through the night
 phir laga ki acting karne aayaa tha
 Must do acting agle din uthaa or yash chopra ke paas gaya or kaha, mere paas kaam nahin he
 And neither is money
 unhone muhabbatein main narayan shankar kaa role diya
 Then the work started anew
 rajasthan ke das shaharon main 4 aktubar se ‘cross sailing' ke kilaaf rajasthan marudhara gramin bank ke karmchaaree pradarshan kar rahe hai
 It is important to understand the game of 'cross selling'
 beemaa company jab apana utpaada bechegi to uske liye karmchaaree rakhegi, agent rakhegi, rojgaar bhi badhegaa
 But now instead of that, the bank employee is asked to sell insurance products of the bank's subsidiary company
 bank kaa manager yaa karmchaaree is kaary main sakasham nahin hota he
 His job is to do bank work
 aapke khate ko sanbhaalanaa, karz dena vagairah
 But with this, he is now being targeted to sell insurance products
 is target ko puraa karne ke liye bank karmi graahakon se jhooth bolte hai
 Without his knowledge, we insure him, because if he does not insure such a number, his life becomes difficult
 unhen apamaanit kiya jaataa he
 The people of the bank accepted this inhuman system
 cross sailing ne bank karmiyon ko maansik rup se pratadit kiya he
 If you do not oppose any wrong while walking on Satyagraha, then it will be said to be accepted
 jab tak aapke bheetar aniatikta kaa anupaat adhik hoga, aap kisi bhi shoshan se mukt ho hi nahin sakate hai
 Now the staff officers of big banks remained silent but the employees of Rajasthan Marudhara Gramin Bank started protesting
 yah ek dilachasp ghatana he
 For this, they have also paid the price
 bhartiya state bank ne saat karmchaariyon ko nilambit kar diya he
 The State Bank of India is patronized by Marudhara Gramin Bank
 prabandhan ne har branch ko target diya he ki saal main 6 lakh es bi ai life(beemaa product) bechnaa hi he
 25 lakh mutual funds to sell
 chaar lakh se adhik esbiai general ke donon product bechney hai
 One is accident insurance and one is health insurance
 aise bank ke zyaadaatar graahak saadhaaran aarthik prishthbhumi ke hote hai
 By the way, there are also big banks
 ab bankeron se kaha jaataa he ki jab kisaan lone lene aae to uskaa jabaran beemaa karo
 One year insurance of SBI General's health insurance is Rs 10502
 ho saktaa he ki kisaan kaa kaam ayushmaan beemaa se chal jaae to use kyon yah beemaa lenaa chahie? par banker apana target puraa karne ke liye use phuslaa kar beemaa kar dete hai or lone kii raashi se pehla premium kaat lete hai
 But when it comes to paying the second premium, it is unable to pay
 saath hi lone kii raashi bhi kam ho jaati he jo vah nahin chukaa paata he
 The farmer also gets cheated and the bank also gets NPA because his loan given does not come back
 cross sailing ke zarie bainkon ne bharat ke kisaanon ko bade paimaane par lutaa he
 They say that they or anyone is constantly kept in the thick of religious nationalism, so it is not known
 aap bank paisa nikaalane gaye hai
 Have gone to take a loan
 beemaa kaa faisla bhi nahin kiya he
 Not even thought
 lekin aap par koi polisy thope di jaati he
 Bankers are also selling policies to their friends and relatives to meet the target
 yahi haal sarkaar kii beemaa yojanaon kaa hua
 Somehow sold so that the government claims to be successful and you were not told whether the second or third premium was paid
 banker apane bank ke product to bech hi rahe hai, sarkaar ke product bhi bech rahe hai
 The first bankers were lured by commission for this
 reserve bank ne saaf saaf kaha he ki kamishan nahin die ja sakate hai phir bhi yah kaam chal hi rahaa he
 Cross selling is a bad tradition
 2016 main america ke ek bade bank wales phargo main iskaa maamla aayaa tha tab bank ke us president ko istipha dena padaa tha
 Cross selling was considered as a fraud
 bank par saikadon karod kaa jurmaana laga tha
 Moneylife has also campaigned against cross selling in India
 inds ind bank ne 79 saal ke ek buzurg kii fiks dipazit tudwa diya or galat tareeke se majaboor kiya ki ve duusare product main nivesh karen
 From time to time, senior officials of the Reserve Bank have said that banks should not sell such products
 marudhara bank ke karmchaariyon kii maang bilkul sahi he ki top management ke khaaton kii jaanch honi chahie taaki pataa chale ki unhen kamishan ke taur par kitna mil rahaa he
 This is called political consciousness
 is sandarbh main rajasthan marudhara gramin bank ke karmchaariyon kaa pradarshan mahatvapurn he
 At least he protested for himself and others
 ummid he unki ladaai kamishan hasil karne kii nahin hogi balki graahak par jabaran beemaa yaa velth product thope kar kamaane kii aniatik pravriti ke kilaaf hogi
 The employees of other banks, who are troubled by this oppression, should also come forward and support the employees of Marudhara Gramin Bank
 nijee str par bhi bankeron ko saaf saaf bataanaa chahie ki unke bank main kitne aise graahak hai jin par beemaa thopa gaya, wo ek do premium ke baad nahin chukaa paae
 
 uskaa laabh kise adhik mila
 What was the impact on the debt of farmers due to paying two premiums
 bankeron ko chupake se ye baat sabhi ko bataanaa chahie
 If they go to the wedding, if they are walking in the bus, then tell the people
 anaam poster banaakar jagah jagah laga den
 Put such details in people's inbox silently
 bankeron ko naitik bal arjeet karnaa hi hoga
 Not so helpless and naive
 bank kii naukari ke baad dahez maangane main to bade bahadur nazar aate hai, ab kya ho gaya
 Women bankers should also open the poll in Inbox about whether they had taken dowry when they married a banker
 purush banker bhi satyagrah karen
 Explain how much commission is charged while giving loan, why people complain about it? All these debates will bring moral strength in all of us and will reduce suffering in our lives
 varna raveesh kumaar ke post likhane yaa tivi par dikhaane se badlaav nahin aayega
 Which is very lacking in them
 ve in baton se pareshaan to hai magar ise mitaane ke liye eemaandaar nahin hai
 One who is not honest about his issues should stay away from him
 isliye maine bank series band kar di
 If someone you know works in the bank, ask him about it
 aniatikta par chuppi bankeron par hi baari pad rahi he
 It has been two years but his salary has not increased yet
 behad kam selary main bade-bade shaharon main kaam karne ke liye majaboor hai
 There is a lot of suffering in his life
 bainkon ke bheetar adhikariyon se kaha ja rahaa he ki ve ek lakh do lakh yaa paanch lakh ke share khreeden
 They are being forced to take loans and buy their bank shares
 kisi bhi paribhaasha se yah daastaa hi he
 Bankers know that is going wrong
 chunki zyaadaatar logon kii (sirf bankeron kii nahin) raajnneetik chetana bhrasht ho gai he isliye ve har galat ko ab sahane lage hai
 People trapped in blind patriotism wave arms on sentimental and false things, but do not budge against such exploitation happening with them
 jab banker hi apane atmasamman kii chintaa nahin karenge to doosraa koun karegaa? kyon karegaa? ve akele nahin hai
 Their number is in millions
 ve counter par graahak kaa koon chus rahe hai or bank unka koon chus rahaa he
 Is embarrassing
 yah bataata he ki 20 lakh logon ko ghulaam banaaya ja saktaa he
 Do Satyagraha
 apane jivan ko pidaa mukt karen
 Make it simple and easy
 mujhase aapaki takalif dekhi nahin jaati he
 Note- Many people say that their company has not paid salary for three months
 mujhe iskaa detail bhejein
 i am not going to get salary
 balki main adhyayan karnaa chahta hum ki ek kashmir par jhooth paros kar aapse kitni badi keemat vasuuli ja rahi he
 You do not have to tell how you will send the details
 meraa pataa maaloom chal jayega
 Provide the details properly and honestly

 The Meteorological Department has issued a warning to the forest department, saying that the sudden increase in temperature can increase the incidence of fire in the forests, for which preparation needs to be done in advance

 In Badrinath, the weather has started without snow, while in Gangotri Dham, snow has started spreading its shadow

 Due to the high quantity of pine in the forest of Uttarakhand, it is believed that in the summer season, the possibility of fire in the forest increases due to increasing heat

 mahilaon ke liye sabase keemtee cheez hoti he gahanen or usamen bhi mangalsutra ko to kisi ko to haath tak lagane nahin detii hai
 But can you imagine that a woman will mortgage her jewelry for the toilet
 wo bhi us jamaane main jab sarkaar shauchalay banane ke liye logon ko sabsidi de rahi he
 It is motivating them not to defecate in the open and make toilets
 lekin bihar ke rohtas main ek mahila sarkari babu ke chakkar kaat kar itani thak gai ki usne apane gahane girvee rakh karshauchalaybanwane kaa faisla kiya
 Phool Kumari, 30, of Bahkhanna village of Vikramganj in Rohtas district, has set a unique example of making toilets in the house by mortgaging all the ornaments, including his mangalsutra
 khub lagaae sarkari daftaron ke chakkarsanjhauli prakhand kii udaipur panchayat kii yah mahila paise ke abhaav main ghar main shauchalay nahin banavaa paa rahi thi
 He made several rounds of government offices, pleaded for help but got no help
 jahaan soch vahaan shauchalay kaa naaraa dene vaali sarkaar se jab use madad nahin mili tab usne apane bal parashauchalaybanwane kaa nirnay liya
 The importance of toilets was also explained to the family members that this decision was not easy for a woman to get a toilet made by pledging her jewelry and especially Mangalasutra
 phulkumari ke mutabik use saas or pati ne gahane girvee rakhane se roka lekin uske samajhane par shauchalay kii kya upyogita he wo raji ho gaye
 According to Phoolkumari, the fear of tampering with the danger of animals like snakes by going out in the open defecation always irritated him and decided to build toilets in the house
 baaki paise jodne ke liye karegi mazdooreephulkumari ne ghar main shauchalay ke nirmaan ke liye apane mangalsutra, samet sabhigahane girveerakh die
 There was a cost of 12 thousand to build a toilet, but after mortgaging the jewelry, only 9 thousand rupees could be found
 phulkumari ne kaha ki baaki kii rakam wo mazdooree karke ikkatha karegi
 Under the Mission Pratishtha, the award will be given to the flowerful, who hopes to have a toilet built by August 15
 uskaa maananaa he ki ghar main lakhon ke gahane ho or ghar main shauchalay nahin ho to gahanon kaa koi mulya nahin he
 But in this entire case, the prestige was made by the government under which it is said that the government will help on the construction of toilets, if the government would have helped, then today Phulkumari would not have to mortgage her jewelry
 par un sarkari adhikariyon ko salaam jo apni 'mishan pratishtha' ko safal qaraar dene ke liye na sirf ab phulkumari ke jazbe ko salaam karnaa chaahati he balki use puraskrit bhi karegi

 Aamir Khan now just has to break Aamir Khan's record
 shahrukh, salmaan ke baad somvaar ko rithik roshan ko bhi unhone pachhad diya
 We are talking about Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma's box office collection of the film 'PK'
 duusare veekend tak film 236 karod rupee kamakar salmaan khan kii 'kik' se aage nikal chuki thi
 The film grossed around Rs 11 crore on Monday
 ab film kii kamai ho gai he 247 karod rupee
 Hrithik Roshan's film Krrish 3 released on Diwali last year, 240
 5 karod rupee kamaaye the
 In that sense, 'krrish 3' was the second highest in terms of earnings
 magar somvaar ke baad yah spotamir khan kii 'pike'ke hisse aa gaya
 And now Aamir is competing with Aamir himself
 aamir khan kii pichley saal ke ant main ai film 'dhooma3' ne gharelu box offis par kul 280 karod rupee kii kamai kii he
 It is the most successful Hindi film ever in terms of currency
 or 'pike' agar ise pachhad detii he, to number van film ban jaaegi
 This claim is also interesting because 'PK' director Rajkumar Hirani's previous film 'three Idiots' remained the highest-grossing Hindi film for a long time with a gross of Rs 202 crores
 vaise atakalein is baat kii bhi lagaai ja rahi hai kihindu sanghathanon ke virodh or vivaad ke chalate 'pike'ko or bhi laabh milegaa
 The film is being promoted in a different way and due to this, the curiosity of those who are usually away from theaters is increasing
 aise main 'pike' hindi filmon ke 300 karod club kii bhi shuruyaat kar sakati he
 'PK' is also getting the benefit that no major film is coming to the box office until two weeks after its release
 is shuukravaar ko anuraag kashyap kifilm ‘agali’relies hui he
 But his genre is crime and drama
 film kaa prachaar zyada nahin hua or family class aisi filmon ke liye aati nahin
 In such a situation, 'PK' is in front of New Year's holiday and the weekend after that and then the next week is free run
 dekhen kahaan tak jaati he 'pike' kii res

 The court had asked Tiwari to settle the case peacefully through mediation

 ND Tiwari said yes thrice after a brief silence on the question whether he is also your successor

 Bowed his head and bowed
 tiwari ne rohit ke gaal par haath pheraa or kaha, main chahta hum ki rohit mere saath rahe

 This statement of ND Tiwari came days after the High Court rejected the request for arbitration

 ’ Rich singer-musician-record producer Papon of diverse talents, like many other musicians, was a bit 'disappointed'
 ve gambhir vishay par kisi 'buddhijivi' kii tarah bolne kii taiyaari kar aae the
 Instead, they were asked to do what is said everywhere, that is, to sing
 yah bhi gajab kaa sanyog tha ki papon puure din chalane vaale is aayojan main bich main pahunche
 Before them Daler Mehndi and Udit Narayan performed their art, then later Kailash Kher, Sonu Nigam and Shaan
 us dopaher or der shaam tak in sabake saath swatchta doot kii ek oopaadhi bhi jud gai thi
 All these brilliant talents together tied up a wonderful show in India Today Safdigiri Awards on 2 October on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti
 kai logon ko, gayakon ko bhi yah ehsaas nahin hua tha, jaisaa papon ek jatke main kah gaye, ki is geet-sangeet se swatchta kaa ek gambhir or saumy sandesh bhi nikalegaa, jo pradhanmantri narendra modi ke svachh bharat abhiyaan ke elaan kaa anokhaa mauka ban jayega
 It ended with the handing over of Safaigiri Awards to Narendra Modi
 lekin india today group ke chairman or editor in chif ne apane udghaatan bhaashan main jaisaa kaha, thik usee baat ko gayakon ne bhi apane sandesh main doharaaya
 And that was that music is beyond all cultural boundaries and it gives tremendous communication of unity and enthusiasm among the people
 darshakon kii bheed ke saamne gaanaa vaaki dilari kaa kaam he to daler mehandi beshak dilon ke raja hai
 Not only did he sing the song "safai ki Dhun Yaar Mere Sun, o Rab De Bande Safai Bada Gunn" of Safagiri, besides adding a message of cleanliness to his many other popular songs, he created a good atmosphere
 unka sandesh ''gandagi kii bain di, puraa india chamak da
 
 
 Long before Daler Mehndi became famous as a professional singer, a man was synonymous with 'romantic song-music' in an all-time smiling face and voice
 saal 1988 kaa tha or geet tha 'papa kehete hai bada naam karegaa' or vah aawaaj thi udit narayan kii
 For the next two decades, his melodious voice worked in 35 languages, not just in Hindi
 maano yahi jataane ke liye udit narayan ne safigiri tech aword ke vijeta rajagopalan vasudevan ko sammanit karte vakt tamil main gaanaa sunaaya
 Their message can be kept safe by adopting simplicity
 ve abhi bhi hazbek car hi chalaate hai
 Then came Papon, he was somewhat surprised as to whether he would fit in the atmosphere created after Udit Narayan's pleasant romantic songs
 unhone barfi! ke geet 'kyuu, na ham tum chale tede-medhe se raaston pe nange paanv re' se shuru kiya to darshak thirakane lage or aadhe ghante se adhik samay tak bollywood or bihu kii dhunon par log jhuumate or naachte rahe
 When his message reaches his home state of Assam, he will ask his fans, who call themselves Paponists, to continuously keep their cities and streets and streets clean
 papon kii tarah bollywood or indi rock sangeet ko ek saath saadhane vaale kailash kher ne 'allaah ke bande', 'sainyaa' or 'teri divaani' jaise geeton se surila samaa baandh diya
 Kher honored the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and the Chandigarh administration for the cleanest market (connaught Place) and the Garden (rock Garden) respectively
 in donon hi jagahon par ve prastuti de chuke hai
 His message with a band Kailasa during a show at Qutub Minar, he was stunned to see 'mohabbat Ka Paigam' written on the wall of the tower
 unhone kaha, ''ham hindustani pyaar karne main bejod hai lekin ye bhavanaaen hamaare gharon ke bheetar hi honi chahie
 "while Kher has a sour-sweet relationship with Bollywood, Sonu Nigam can be said to be crazy about Mayanagari ever since his mustache did not grow, that is, he had not grown up
" is aayojan ke kuch pehle hi unke gale kii kharash thik hui thi isliye unke liye oonche suron main gaanaa sambhav nahin tha
 Nevertheless, Sonu, who sang in a soft voice, praised such an addiction that even his father could not stop himself from singing ghazals
 unka sandesh nimna madhya varg se aane vaale sonu nigam ne kaha ki agar ve ''shauchalay or saaf-safai se judi' jaisi acchhee aadaten daal sakate hai to shaharon main rahane vaale duusare logon ke liye bhala yah kyon mushkil hona chahie
 Like Sonu Nigam, Shaan, who forced the Indians to swing in the early stages of the Countdown show on TV, gave the audience a chance to dance to the tune of 'char Kadam Bas Char Kadam, Chaal Do Na Saath Mere'
 unka sandesh ''koi kahe kahata rahe, bharat main hogi safai
 
 
 
 ''hindustan ke shaayad sabase bade 'rockstar' ke liye manch taiyaar tha
 After all, they can guarantee to fill any stadium or hall on their own on a few hours' notice
 jaisaa ki arun puri ne pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa swaagat karte vakt darshakon ko yaad dilaayaa, ''desh ke sabase urjavan, iklauti fouj, vah shaks jisamen ham sabaki sammilit urja se bhi zyada urja he, sidhe bihar kii rajnatik reliyon se yahaan pahunch rahe hai

 Spends, this money could have been spent elsewhere
 unhone kaha ki vishwa bank kii report ke mutabik bharat main kareeb 60 karod log khule main shouch karte hai or yah sankramak rogon ke failane kii sabase badi vajah he
 That is why the call for a clean India was needed
 sarkaar ne desh bhar main 60 lakh shauchalay banane kaa lakshya rakhaa tha
 He said, "yesterday i asked how many have been made because there was only one day left in Gandhi Jayanti
 mujhe bataaya gaya ki 95 lakh shauchalay ban gaye hai
 "amid the applause of the audience, he said," Swachh Bharat Abhiyan will not be successful merely by being a government program
 agar yah sirf modi kaa kaarykram banakar rah jayega to yah shartiya safal nahin hoga
 It will be successful only when it becomes our program
 ''sabhi achche vichaaron kii tarah, jo amuman kisi achaanak ai sujh kii tarah ubharate hai, svachh bharat kaa najariya bhi pichley saal 15 agast ko apni puri samagrata main nahin sochaa gaya tha, jab pradhanmantri ne apane swatantraaa diwas ke bhaashan main iskaa elaan kiya

 Apart from Kelo, Chhattisgarh has sent the Perimandih, Candula and Tendula projects to the Central Water Commission, but the approval of the Technical Advisory Committee for their construction has not been received yet
 inako lekar odisha sarkaar kaa aarope he ki tendula dam par nirmaan kaary bina sweekruti ke kiya gaya he or inase odisha main jalsankat khadaa ho jayega
 In this battle, the BJP unit of Odisha is in defense of the Raman Singh government of Chhattisgarh and is blaming the Naveen Patnaik government of the state for possible waterfall in Odisha

 Odisha Chief Secretary Aditya Padhi said that the barrages being constructed by Chhattisgarh are illegal, their construction should be stopped
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki mahanadi maamle ko lekar chhattisgarh ne odisha ko koi jaankaree nahin di
 According to him, the construction of these dams will not only save water for Odisha

 The Hirakud Dam itself supplies water to the capital Bhubaneswar and Cuttack

 According to a report by IIT Madras and Mumbai, in the last 10 years, the Mahanadi in Odisha has reduced by 10%

 Chhattisgarh government has stopped huge amount of water in Odisha by constructing 41 dams one by one on Mahanadi
 iskaa sidhaa asar monsoon ke baad dikhegaa
 It is being said that there will be a huge decline in irrigation, drinking water and power generation in Odisha
 lekin odisha sarkaar ko suchit na karne ke bijedy ke daawey kii hawa nikaalane kaa kaam sabase pehle sarkaar ke varisht mantri damodar raut ne hi kar diya
 He said that work on the Kelo Dam has been going on since 2008 and the government does not know that this thing is not embraced

 On the other hand, Chhattisgarh Water Resources Minister Brijmohan Agrawal has said that the matter is only with Arpa Bhainsajhar
 iske liye centre se anumati mil chuki he
 According to him, the charge of the Chief Secretary of Odisha is wrong that the Government of Odisha was not informed
 april 2008 main odisha sarkaar ne patr likhakar jaankaree maangi thi, jo di ja chuki he
 The question is then why the Odisha government and the opposition are raising this issue in their own way? In fact, the compulsion of the government is that the Gram Panchayat elections are to be held in February next year
 pani, bijli or sinchai kaa ghor sankat patnayak sarkaar ke liye nai musiibat ban saktaa he
 Therefore, it is favorable for him to throw the matter on the head of Chhattisgarh

 bhartiya team test haar chuki thi, haalanki ek yaa do satr ko chhod den to is mukaable main zyaadaatar samay tak bharat kaa hi palada baari lag rahaa tha or ekatarfa jeet dikhaai de rahi thi
 There was silence like a weeds in the Indian dressing room

 There were two Tests left
 captain kii chetavanee thi, jitkar dikhaao, varanaa main tumhaare liye ladaai nahin karuunga
 All the players were listening silently to the captain's fight or die warning
 kisi ke munh se ek shabd bhi nahin nikal rahaa tha
 The next morning, when the team's bus exited the Lighthouse Hotel and when they arrived at the Taj Samudra Hotel in Colombo, some players discussed their game with the captain in a three-hour journey
 unhone kohli ko bataaya ki is haar se ve bhi dukhi the or ab ve puraani galtiyaan nahin karenge
 The captain may have lost the first encounter, but he had an idea that he could win the battle

 Now comes the scene of the Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC) ground in Colombo

 After 22 years, the Indian team has won the series in Sri Lanka
 kohli ne apni shart utaar lee or ek kshan ke liye laga ki ve bhi usee tarah apni shart hawa main laharaayenge, jis tarah 2002 main lodrs main jeet ke baad saurabh ganguli ne apni shart utaar kar hawa main laharaai thi
 But Kohli stopped himself and bounced towards the Indian fans standing down his shirt and some other marks
 team ke khiladinnon ne jahaan team ke nideshak ravi shastri kii ore se hotel main di gai ek party kaa anand liya, kohli ne phir josh bharne vaale andaaj main kaha, ''jeet hasil karnaa hamaari aadat honi chahie

 The series win against Sri Lanka is the first win in the Test series on the foreign ground in the last four years
 dekhne vaali baat yah he ki is jeet main gendbaajon kii bhoomika pramukh rahi he
 In the three Test matches in which Sri Lanka played all six of their innings, India took all 60 of its wickets
 gaale main gendbaaji ke badlaavon ke alaava, unhone pich or match ke halaat ko lagbhag thik-thik samaj liya tha
 The way fast bowler Ishant Sharma bowled according to his captain's plan is perhaps the biggest achievement of this tour for India

 Many of his players have now become the backbone of the Indian team
 ab ek nai bhartiya team khadi ho rahi he, jisamen nayaa aatmavishvaas dikh rahaa he

 is nai toli ko is nai hakeekat se madad mil rahi he ki lambey samay baad bharat ko aisa captain mila he jo paanch gendbaajon ko team main rakhkar test match jeetne kaa jokhim uthaane ko taiyaar he
 Those who know the dressing room say that senior players like Harbhajan Singh and Amit Mishra also performed well due to the captain's confidence
 gaale main harbhajan kaa pradarshan bhale prabhaavshaalee na rahaa ho lekin mishra ne phiraki gendbaaji main behtareen pradarshan kiya
 Although Ashwin won the Man of the Series award in Sri Lanka with 21 wickets, Mishra also took an average of 1 wicket in less than 30 balls
 mishra kehete hai, ''captain jab aapmen apana bharosa jataata he to aapako takat milti he
 "but if Kohli's greatest strength is anything, it is his flexibility
" gaale kii haar main hone vaali galatiyon ko unhone turant sweekaar kar liya tha
 Although he received severe criticism for stating that he immediately called Stuart Binny from India, but he proved to be right
 rohit sharma number teen ke sthaan par itane achche nahin rahe hai, jisase unki jagah ajinkya rahane ko laayaa gaya
 But when Pujara hit a match-winning century in the last Test, Kohli's batting order again caught its rhythm
 dakshin africa ke khilaaf chaar test maichon main bharat vijay or dhawan ke saath opening kar saktaa he
 It will be followed by Pujara, Kohli and Rahane
 kohli agar chah ballebaajon ke saath khelte hai to rohit chathe number par ballebaaji karenge
 "there is no slot in this batting line-up," says Kohli
 ham sthitiyon or team kii jaruraton ke aadhaar par khiladinnon kii bhoomika tay karenge
 It is natural to be tempted to make comparisons between Kohli's team and Sourav Ganguly's team, which took over the reins of the team in 2000
 ganguli kii team main sachin tendulkar, rahul dravid or anil kumble jaise kai diggaj khilaadi the, lekin yah bhi sahi he ki unhone virendra sahvaag, yuvaraj singh, jahir khan or harbhajan singh jaise yuva khiladinnon par bharosa karke majboot team khadi kii thi
 Now Kohli has the same opportunity
 ganguli kehete hai, ''main nahin samajhataa ki viraat kii captaini kii tulana mujhase yaa dravid se yaa dhoni se kii jaani chahie
 Kohli's spirit reminds me of Diego Maradona
 ''is team ko kohli or team ke nideshak ravi shastri ke bich talmail se bhi phayda ho rahaa he
 If Kohli and his team get a big win in the South Africa series, then India will be ranked number two in the International Cricket Council rankings

" no one else, but Congress Party MLA KN Tripathi said in the government
 darasal jharkhand kii navgathit saajha sarkaar main talmail kii baari kami saaf dekhi ja rahi he
 All the parties involved in the government are doing their duffali, their melody
 jis saajha kaarykram par is sarkaar kii buniyaad rakhi gayi thi, uski baat ab koi nahin karata
 While the leaders of the parties involved in the government are trying to find a source of income, the opposition is lost in the memories of its golden days
 sarkaar ke gathan ke teen maheenon ke dauraan hue kaamon kaa lekh-jokha abtak sifer hi rahaa he
 Not only this, there is a huge lack of coordination between the various parties involved
 JMM aagaamee chunaavon ko lekar apana vot bank majboot karne main laga he, to congress, mukhyamantri hemanth sorain ke haalia bayanon se kaaphi khafa he
 Soren gave his opinion on the Centre's Food Security Bill and the Land Acquisition Bill, in which he referred to the shortcomings of both these bills
 congress ke pradesh adhyaksh sukhdev bhagat kaa kahana he ki in sab muddon ko uchit forum main uthaanaa chahie
 Due to these statements of the Chief Minister, there has been a deadlock in the alliance
 bakaul bhagat, hemanth sarkaar ko kaamkaaj ke maamle main pichhali sarkaron se alag laganaa chahie, lekin aisa ho nahin rahaa he
 The tussle between the JMM and the Congress can also be gauged from the fact that all the mlas and state presidents of the constituent parties were to attend the Chief Minister's convening meeting on Thursday, but only a few Congress mlas were involved in it
 joined in
 adhiktar ne iskaa kaaran pehle se tay kaarykram or vyastata ko bataaya
 The meeting was to review the progress of the common program, apart from the coordination between the constituents of the government and the functioning of the government so far
 hemanth sorain sarkaar ke ab tak kii pragati par apni tipanni darj karte hue congress ke rajyasabha saansad pradeep balamuchu ne kaha ki sarkaar ko beurocrates chalaa rahe hai, kyonki isamen aise logon ko mantri pad se nawaja gaya he, jo pehali baar chunakar aae hai or jinhen sarkaar chalaane kaa koi anubhav nahin he
 It is not that the talk is only between the two big parties involved in the government
 sarkaar main shaamil RJD bhi shikayaton kaa pulinda thame baithak main shaamil hui
 An Independent MLA Enos Ekka says that he has no information about the meeting
 soobe ke rajyapal ne bhi ishaaron-ishaaro main sarkaar ko naseehat dete hue kaha ki unke dwaara chode gaye li par aage badhanaa chahie
 Amongst all this, who should ask about the poor people? Development has come to a standstill in the state, inflation is touching the sky
 shiksha kaa adhikaar bill lagu karaane par apni peeth thok rahi congress, jharkhand main apana shiksha mantri rahete hue fail he
 The uneducated unemployed are far away, even the educated unemployed have to go for jobs
 jharkhand gathan ke baad se hui har pratiyogita pariksha vivaadon main he
 Someone is being investigated by CBI, then someone is being monitored
 ek main to galat niyukti prakriya apanaaye jane ke kaaran hoicourt ne puri prakriya ko hi radd kar diya tha
 About one lakh teachers are needed to bring education back in the state, while localization has been put in the appointment process of teachers even after passing all the examinations
 jaahir he ki apane kam tajurbe ke kaaran hemanth sorain sarkaar gathan ke baad se hi vivaadon main ghir gai he
 At first there was a lot of tussle over the ministerial position within the JMM, while the Congress could not choose a qualified candidate for the post of minister for two months, due to which the government had to run the half-hearted cabinet in these two months
 sarkaar ko samarthan dene ke evaj main malaaidaar mantri pad kii aas lagaae nirdaleey bhi apni upeksha se khaase naaraaz hai
 In such a situation, it would be meaningless to expect relief from the marginalized government, when its life is in itself
 kabhi sone kii chidiya kahe jane vaale bharat ko jis tarah videshi akramanakariyon ne lutaa, vaisaa hi kuch jharkhand ke saath ho rahaa he
 The only difference is that this time the robbers have their faces
 sahitya, sangeet, kala or shiksha jaise kshetron main apni anuthi pratibha kaa parichay dene vaale nobel puraskaar se sammanit kavi rabindranath tagore aise maanavtaavaadi vichaarak the jinhen prakruti kaa sanidhya kaaphi pasand tha
 He believed that students should pursue education in nature
 apni isi soch ko dhyaan main rakhkar unhone shantiniketan kii sthapana kii thi
 Tagore is perhaps the only poet in the world whose compositions made his national anthem
 bachapan se kushagra buddhi ke rabindranath ne desh or videshi sahitya, darshan, samskruti aadi ko apane andar samahit kar liya tha or vah maanavtaa ko vishesh mahatv dete the
 Its appeal is also clearly reflected in his compositions
 sahitya ke kshetra main unhone apurv yogadan diya or unki rachana "gitanjali" ke liye unhen sahitya ke nobel puraskaar se bhi sammanit kiya gaya tha
 According to critics, his work "gora" is an amazing creation in many ways
 is upanyaas main british kaaleen bharat kaa zikr he
 Discussion of nationality and humanity along with the debate on traditional Hindu society and Brahmo society highlights various prevalent problems
 charchit rachanaakaar maheep singh ke anusaar gora behtareen kriti he jisamen angrej dampatti kii santan hindu parivaar main palati he
 He has no parents and does not know that he is a Christian
 vaastaviktaa kii jaankaree milane par vah pareshaan ho jaataa he or iske saath hi uske vichaar main vyapak badlaav aa jaataa he
 According to Maheep Singh, who has written a famous story like "pani aur Pul" focusing on the partition of India Pakistan, it is a masterpiece depicting his time in which emphasis on human relations more than issues like religion, society
 gora hindu, isai aadi baton ko vyarth maanate hue maanviya sambandhon ko mahatvapurn maanane lagata he
 Gurdev is truly worthy of being a world poet
 unke kavy ke maanavtawaad ne unhen duniya bhar main pahchaan dilaayi
 Tagore's writings brought a new outing in Bengali literature
 unhone ek darjan se adhik upanyaas likhe
 These compositions include Chokher Bali, Ghare Bahire, Gora etc
 unke upanyaason main madhyam vargeey samaaj vishesh rup se ubhar kar saamne aayaa he
 His creative talent has been articulated in Rabindranath Tagore's poems
 unki kavitaaon main prakruti se aadhyatmavaad tak ke vibhinn vishyon ko bakhubi ukera gaya he
 There is hardly any genre of literature that does not contain his works
 unhone kavita, geet, kahani, upanyaas, naatak aadi sabhi main apane shashakt lekhan kaa parichay diya
 Many of his works were also translated into English
 angreji anuwaad ke baad puraa vishwa unki pratibha se parichit hua
 Rabindranath's plays, born on May 7, 1861 in Addasanko, are also unique
 ve naatak sankethik hai
 Rabindranath's prodigious talent was known to people from childhood
 unhone pehali kavita sirf aath saal main likhi or keval 16 saal kii umr main unki pehali laghukatha prakashit huyi thi
 He composed more than two thousand songs
 rabindra sangeet bangla samskruti kaa abhinn ang ban gaya he
 His songs, influenced by Hindustani classical music, portray different shades of human emotion
 gurudev baad ke dinon main chitra bhi banane lage the
 Rabindranath traveled to dozens of countries including America, Britain, Japan, China
 saat agast 1941 ko unka dehavsaan ho gaya
 Anna Hazare's colleague Arvind Kejriwal while addressing the people at the MMRDM ground in Mumbai, Anna's fast, said that the government has betrayed Anna and the people of the country
 bhaajapa kii sarkaar se bill main badlaav kar do-teen maheene baad sansad main laane kii maang par kejariwal ne kaha ki sarkaar ko bill main badlaav jarur karnaa chahie lekin bill isi satr main laayaa janaa chahie or paas kiya janaa chahie
 Kejriwal questioned the government's intentions and asked why they formed a common committee when they did not have to listen to the public
 samiti main die gaye aashwaasan par sarkaar khari nahin utari
 The government did not listen to any of the promises made to Anna
