 pradesh ke mantri kii maane to kanoon-vyavastha chust-durust he or ladki kii baramadagi ke liye bhi prayasarat he, lekin baramadagi hogi bhi yaa nahin ye unhen bhi nahin maaloom
 At present, the new Superintendent of Police of the district has ordered an inquiry into the case afresh

 He is the convenor of the minority wing of the Aam Aadmi Party
 is audio main kejariwal musalamaanon ko zyada tikat nahin dene kii baat kar rahe hai
 This is because it feared polarization of votes
 AAP ke charitra or chaal main farkshuukravaar kii subah media ke saamne aakar asif mohammad kehete hai ki aam aadmi party ke charitra or chaal main bahut fark he
 Asif told that he has one more CD of Arvind's sting

 i did this sting through my watch

 unhone kaha, ‘arvind kejariwal 25 disambar ko hui baithak main ye kah rahe the ki musalamaanon ko tikat dena nahin myne rakhata
 Muslims just want Modi's victory chariot to stop
 congress khatm ho rahi he
 In such a situation, Muslims trust the Aam Aadmi Party
 muslim ummidavaar ko tikat dena myne nahin rakhata
 'he insisted,' This shows that the way the Congress, SP, BSP demand votes from Muslims by showing fear of the BJP, the same work is being done by the Aam Aadmi Party

 The Congress will enter the 2014 election mission under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi
 ye khulaasa hua he congress ke gupt chunavi masaude se
 The Congress has drafted the Election Draft for the Agenda 2014 and out of its 30 pages, 3 pages mention only Rahul Gandhi's leadership
 masaude main kaha gaya he- 2014 main party ko rahul kaa netritv milegaa, halanki isamen bhi ye saaf nahin kiya gaya ki rahul pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar honge
 That is, the election draft of Congress is completely silent on Rahul's PM candidature
 masaude main ummid jataai gai he ki rahul ke netritv se yuvaaon ko jodne main kaaphi madad milegi, party puri takat se maidan main utregi
 Another thing special in Congress' Angeda 2014 is that Obama's election campaign is showing great impact on it
 isamen obama ke chunaav prachaar kii tarah soshal media ke istemaal par jor diya gaya he
 Congress is with Rahul, even though Umaidarahul Gandhi may have called the question of Prime Minister as unnecessary, but there is no longer any opinion in Congress that the 2014 Lok Sabha elections will be fought under Rahul Gandhi's leadership
 viraasat main mili siyasat ko sanbhaalane ke kaushal ko lekar rahul ko bhale hi sawaalon ke katghare main khadaa kiya jaataa ho, lekin congress ko vot ke liye rahul ke karishme se hi he ummid
 Although his position in the organization may be that of the number two leader after Sonia Gandhi, the Congress election battle will be fought only around Rahul

 Direct Cash Subsidy to be Electoral Issue Recently Rahul Gandhi presented a new blueprint of development to the country

 Despite being one of the top leaders of the party that has run the government for nine years, openly criticized the shortcomings of the system
 siyaasi samskruti main badlaav par jor diya lekin votaron ko lubhaane kii samskruti nahin badali
 In the strategy committee draft, it was made clear that the Congress will make direct cash subsidy its election issue in the elections
 congress ne jo apni chunavi ranneeti taiyaar kii, usamen sabase ahm he rahul gandhi ko piem pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par nahin, party netaa project karne kii yojana, sabase badi party banane kaa lakshya or kshetreey dalon se gathjod ko lekar ranneeti taiyaar karnaa
 However, the BJP, which was chasing the mid-term elections, termed the election preparations of the Congress as a political stunt

 In order to bring Mamata Banerjee back in its fold, the government decided to raise funds for West Bengal this year from 22 thousand crore to 30 thousand crore rupees

 If sources are to be believed, the Congress is trying to bring most of the smaller parties under its own flag except the Samajwadi Party and BSP in UP, then there may be an electoral agreement with lalu-paswan once again in Bihar
 iske alaava tamilnadu main congress galatchhemiyon ko dur kar diemke saath phir se chunaav ladane kii jugat main he
 Will the Lok Sabha elections be held in 2013? Now the question is, why did the Congress get ready for the election preparations fourteen months ago? Is there a call for early elections in these preparations? Will the Lok Sabha elections be held in 2013 only? The way in which the three schemes called the Congress' trump card of 2014 victory, direct cash subsidy, food security guaranteeing bread to the poor and land reform legislation benefiting the farmers, is clear that elections The government does not want to take any risk regarding dates
 kya karishma dikhayega rahul kaa netritv?kya rahul gandhi raajnneeti ke pakke khiladi ban chuke hai, jinke sahare congress kii aguwai main upie jeet kii hetric lagane main kaamyaab hogi? sawaal jitna aasaan he, jabaav utana hi pechida

 In search of a separate existence, Shivpal had announced the formation of a secular front on 5 May last year in Etawah after meeting with Mulayam Singh at his brother-in-law Ajant Singh Yadav's house
 tab mulaayam ne shivpal ko manaane kii har sambhav koshish kii or unhen rashtriya raajnneeti main sakriy karne kaa bharosa dilaayaa tha
 Shivpal tried to end the distance with his cousin and SP National General Secretary Ram Gopal Yadav but could not come in the party in the free stream
 pichley varsh 25 sitambar ko shivpal alag morche ke gathan kii ghoshnaa mulaayam singh se karana chaahate the
 For this, a press conference was also called in the office of Lohia Trust in Lucknow, but Mulayam Singh was killed on the occasion
 lakhanu vishvavidhyalay ke raajnneeti shaastra vibhaag main associat professor manish hindvi bataate hai, ''mulaayam singh yadav sidhe taur par shivpal ke samarthan main nahin aae, is kaaran shivpal yadav parivaar main bhi gumnami main pahunch gaye the
 The compulsion to preserve political existence forced them to take a different path
 ''mulaayam singh ek baar phir shivpal ko manaane ko sakriy ho gaye hai
 He called Shivpal at his residence in Lucknow on 4 September and met but Shivpal turned down every proposal of his elder brother for a settlement
 jaswantnagar se sapa vidhayak shivpal yadav ko apni vidhansabha sadsyta kii phikr bhi he, isiilie unhone sapa se alag koi party na banaakar morcha gathit kiya he
 Scattered in coalition: In the next Lok Sabha elections, the announcement of formation of Secular Front amid a possible alliance between SP and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has raised the political temperature of the state
 akhilesh ke netritv vaali sapa se yuvaaon kaa judaav bhale hi ho par janaadhar vaale kai varisht netaaon par shivpal kii acchhee pakad he
 Political analysts are speculating that creating a separate front for Shivpal from the Lok Sabha elections will weaken the anti-bjp opposition unity
 govind vallabh pant saamaajik vigyaan santhaan ke nideshak dow
 Badri Narayan says, "shivpal Yadav has supporters in every district of UP
 shivpal ke alag raah pakadaaey se sapa ke mul vot bank main bhram kii sthiti paidaa ho sakati he jo sapa-basapa ke sambhavit gathbandhan ke liye anukool nahin
 BJP also wants the same
 '' haalanki akhilesh yadav ke paksh main kisi prakaar kii sahanubhuti na paidaa ho, iske liye shivpal ne bhi badi chaturaai se sapa-basapa gathbandhan main shaamil hone kii baat kahi he (dekhen baatcheet)
 If the formation of the Secular Front has blossomed BJP, SP leaders close to Akhilesh Yadav are also feeling relieved
 sapa ke ek pradesh sachiv bataate hai, ''purv main basapa adhyaksh mayawati ko lekar shivpal yadav ne kaaphi amaryadit bayaan die the
 BSP leaders are hesitant about Shivpal
 unke sapa se alag raah pakadaaey par sapa-basapa ke bich sambhavit gathbandhan kii baatcheet main aasaani hogi
 It will not be easy for Shivpal to connect small parties to the secular front
 secular morcha ke gathan se thik ek din pehle shivpal ne bhaajapa gathbandhan ke saajheedaar or yogi sarkaar main cabinet mantri om prakaash rajbhar se mulaakaat kii thi
 After the formation of Secular Front, Rajbhar has kept distance from it
 rajbhar kehete hai, ''pichley maheenon main meri shivpal se kai mulaakaaten hui hai par inkaa raajnneeti se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Shivpal Yadav has put forward the youth to create an atmosphere in favor of Kaman Morcha
 unke bete aditya yadav ''shivpal yadav phens association' ke binar tale yuva netaaon ko morcha main shaamil karne main jute gaye hai
 State president of Shivpal Yadav Fans Association, Ashish Choubey says, "A 51-member executive of the association has been formed in 60 districts of UP
 hamaara sanghathan upekshit netaaon ko secular morcha se jodgaye kaa kaam karegaa
 For this the organization is divided into Eastern, Central and Western zones
 '' itawa main 'mulaayam ke log' naamak sanghathan banaakar purv jiladhyaksh sunil yadav upekshit sapa netaaon ko ek manch par laane main jute hai
 Deepak Mishra, the elected secretary of the 'international Socialist Council' and the socialist leader who has received the prestigious 'mandela Award' of Africa, has previously been the president of the SP Intelligence Cell
 shivpal ke najdiki mishra par desh bhar main samaajawaadee vichaardhaara se jude netaaon ko secular morche se jodgaye kii jimmedaari he

 These leaders may not have left the SP, but coming in support of Shivpal's front, they will definitely try to undermine the party
 lekin shivpal ke saamne sabase badi chunauti khud kii siyaasi haisiyat khadi karne kii he
 The formation of Secular Front has brought relief to the BJP if the SP leaders close to Akhilesh Yadav are feeling relieved
 shivpal singh yadav se baatcheet'sapa-basapa ke gathbandhan se secular morcha ko parhez nahin'samaajawaadee secular morcha ke gathan ke baad pehali baar lakhanu pahunche shivpal yadav ne 4 sitambar ko lakhanu ke vikramaditya maarg par sthit apane awaas main ashish mishra se baatcheet kii
 Edited excerpts: Why there was a need to create secular front? There are leaders in all parties who are neglected
 gandhivadi, lohiavaadi, choudhary charan singh vaadi jaise samaan vichaardhaara ke log hai
 The Secular Front is not a party, but a platform of like-minded parties and leaders
 aapke is faisle se yadav parivaar main jhagada or badhegaa?parivaar main jhagada nahin he
 i am an MLA, i do not want to become Chief Minister
 sapa main kareeb sabhi padon par rah chukaa hum
 i just want work
 ab akhilesh yadav se sulah kii koi gunjaaish he?sulah kii baat karte-karte to itnaa vakt biit gaya he
 Akhilesh does not listen to his father
 akele koi party nahin chal sakati
 But Mulayam Singh Yadav is with son Akhilesh Yadav? i have formed the secular front by asking Netaji (mulayam Singh Yadav)
 unki sahmati he or ve mere saath rahenge bhi
 The Secular Front will create a 'vote cut' for the possible alliance of the SP-BSP in the Lok Sabha elections? It is clear that we too have a position
 hamaare paas janaadhar he
 If you have the status of a front, then join us in the alliance
 yani aapako sapa-basapa ke saath banane vaale vipakshi dalon ke gathbandhan se parhez nahin?gathbandhan se hame koi parhez nahin
 The front is also built for this reason
 hamaari haisiyat ke hisaab se loksabhaa chunaav main siten deni padengi
 i am ready to be a part of the alliance
 aisa nahin hua to morcha sabhi 80 siton par chunaav ladega
 You are being accused of increasing your proximity to the BJP? These allegations are false
 na maine bhaajapa ke logon se koi baatcheet kii, na bhaajapa ke logon ne mujhase baat kii he
 i met the Chief Minister
 maine bhaajapa sarkaar main faile bhrashtachar ke viruddh aawaaj uthaai he
 Such things are being done to deviate the struggle that i have declared
 aapkaa sangharsh kiske khilaaf he?jinke paas janaadhar hai unhen koi puch nahin rahaa
 Those who are flattering and cheating are being paid attention
 raajnneeti main is nai pratha kaa main virodh kar rahaa hum
 Did you support the BJP in the presidential election? i voted for the BJP candidate on Dunke's injury
 aap mujhase vot maangoge nahin, kisi baithak main nahin bulaaoge, meri upeksha karoge to main aapkaa samarthan kaise karuunga
 If you called in the Rajya Sabha elections, i supported you
 nai raajnneetik or paariwarik paristhitiyon main aap swayan ko alag-thalag mahasoos kar rahe hai?mere paas janaadhar he
 Who will isolate me
 har jile main lakhon kii taadaad main hamaare samarthak hai jo hamaare morche se judsa chaahate hai
 It is being said that you are also worried about the future of your son Aditya Yadav? Two years ago, i had expressed my motive in the sp's Silver Jubilee celebrations
 main laalchee nahin hum
 What is the strategy of the front? Many big leaders and small parties are in touch with us
 morcha ke sansadeey board or rashtriya se lekar jila str par samitiyon kaa gathan hoga
 Only by talking democratically will the strategy be decided

 Congress spokesperson Mathura Dutt Joshi says that the entire state knows that Yashpal Arya has committed infidelity, so it is reasonable to discuss his infidelity
 bijepi main shaamil hue the yashpalyashpal arya ne haal hi main congress chhodkar bijepi kaa daaman thama he
 He was a cabinet minister in the state's Congress government till a week ago
 yashpal arya kisi vakt congress ke pradesh adhyaksh pad par bhi virajman rah chuke hai
 BJP has given ticket to Yashpal Arya from Bajpur and his son Sanjeev Arya from Nainital seat
 yashpal arya congress main rahete hue apane bete ke liye tikat maangane ke saath udhamsinghnagar kii sabhi 9 siton par tikat baantne kii jimmedaari chaah rahe the, jise congress ne manjuur nahin kiya
 After this, Yashpal Arya changed his seat and moved to the BJP camp
 or bhi hai 'bevafa'
 
 
 Yashpal Arya is not the first leader who switched sides from Congress and joined BJP
 beete saal 18 march ko congress main hui baghawat ke dauraan 10 baagi vidhayakon ke party se kinaaraa karne kii jaankaree lagbhag 10 ghante pehle hi sab ko ho gai thi
 But Yashpal did not even give the party a chance to take a sudden decision
 devbhumi main ek party chhodkar duusari party main jane kaa silsilaa abhi jari he
 Now it has to be seen that when the Congress releases its list, then in which rebels from other parties give tickets
 agar aisa hota he to un baagiyon ke naam ke saath bhi 'bevafa' judana tay he

 saal 1984 ke sikh virdohi danga maamle main congress netaa sajjan kumaar ke bari hone par bavaal much gaya he
 Sikhs are protesting all over Delhi against the court's decision
 sikhon ne joardaar pradarshan karte hue rajdhani dilli ke subhash nagar ilaake main metro ko roak diya
 Due to the uproar, the Metro service on Route number 3 and 4 was stopped for a while
 philhal, seva behaal kar di gai he, lekin subhash nagar or tilak nagar stesan band hai
 The protesters also clashed with the police
 tilak nagar main chakkaa jam kar diya gaya he or sikh jamkar narebaaji kar rahe hai
 Sikhs say that they were acquitted even if there was evidence against Sajjan Kumar
 mangalvaar ko sajjan kumaar ko bari kiye jane kaa faisla jaise hi aayaa sikhon kaa gussa foot padaa
 Riot victims protested fiercely in the court premises itself
 vahiin '84 ke dange main congress netaa sajjan kumaar ko bari kiye jane par congress samarthit sarna gut bhi bachaav kii mudra main he
 Former head of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, Paramjit Singh Sarna says that a commission should be set up on this
 unka kahana he ki isse pataa chal paaegaa ki is maamle main kami kahaan rahi? kya cese thik se ladaa nahin gaya yaa phir nyaayik prakriya main kisi tarah kii kami rahi?dilli gurdvara prabandhak cameti ke purv pradhan kaa kahana he kii court ne sajjan kumaar ko sabooton ke abhaav main choda he
 According to him, it is a matter of investigation as to what is the reason behind the conviction of Sajjan
 sarna ne kaha ki is maamle ko vah hai court main le jaayenge kyonki is faisle se sikhon kii bhaavana aahaat hui he
 What is the whole issue After the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, there were anti-sikh riots across the country
 is dauraan dilli kaint ke rajnagar main 5 sikh kehar singh, gurprit singh, raghuvinder singh, narendra paal singh or kuldeep singh kii hatya kar di gai thi
 Kehar Singh was the husband of Jagdish Kaur, the complainant of the case, while Gurpreet Singh was his son
 is ghatana main maare gaye anya sikh duusare gavaah jagasher singh ke bhai the
 The CBI had registered a case in 2005 against Sajjan Kumar, Captain Bhagmal, former MLA Mahendra Yadav, Girdhari Lal, Krishna Khokhar and former councilor Balwant Khokhar in the Delhi Cantt case on the complaint of Jagdish Kaur and the recommendation of Justice GT Nanavati Commission

 gujarat main ek baar phir bijepi kii sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 BJP is coming to power for the sixth consecutive time in the state, despite the untiring efforts of a trio of Hardik Patel, Jignesh Mevani and Alpesh Thakur with Rahul Gandhi
 sawaal uthta he ki 22 saal kii anti inakambency or jiesti-notebandi se vyapaariyon kii kathith naaraazgi ke baad bhi aakhir congress kyon nahin gujarat kaa bharosa jeet pai? rajya main kyon use mili haar? in sawaalon ke jawaab main 10 kaaran saamne aate hai
 1
 gujarati asmitapiem modi gujarati asmita ke pratik ban gaye hai
 The people of the state have been proud that a Gujarati among them is the Prime Minister of the country
 isliye piem modi ne jab gujaratiyon se apane bete ko jitaane kii bhavuk apil kii, to rajya ke logon ko isse prabhavit hona hi tha
 Sensitive Modi's appeal in the last phase of the election campaign made the Gujaratis sensitized to support the BJP over Gujarati identity
 2
 Hindi vs gujaratirahul Gandhi did a lot of hard work, but he could not connect with Gujaratis like PM Modi due to being outsider and Hindi speaking
 modi ne apane sabhi bhaashan gujarati main die jisase swaabhaavik rup se zyada se zyada gujaratiyon tak wo apni baat pahunchaa paae
 On the other hand, Rahul Gandhi was giving speeches in Hindi, due to which his speeches did not have much effect than Modi
 3
 Congress's Caste Card In Congress, the Congress tried its best to play the caste card by supporting the Patidar movement
 aisa lagata tha ki ab tak jo gujarat vikaas or dharmik vibhaajan ke liye janaa jaataa tha, ab vahaan jaateey dhruvikaran kii raajnneeti chalegi
 But from the results, it seems that this strategy of the Congress did not work
 khaskar alpesh thakur or jignesh mewaani apni seat to kisi tarah jeet gaye lekin wo congress ke samarthan main koi bada jaateey dhruvikaran karne main naakaam rahe
 4
 manishankar ayyar evam kapil sibbelamanishankar ayyar dwaara ain chunaav abhiyaan ke bich piem modi ko 'neech' kahana or kapil sibbal dwaara ram mandir maamle kii pairvi main maamle ko aage taalane kii apil karnaa bhi congress ke liye baari pad gaya
 PM Modi took this statement of Iyer and raised the issue fiercely in the Gujarat election campaign and linked it with his poverty and caste
 rajya kii janata modi kaa apmaan bardaasht nahin karti ye sonia gandhi ke maut ke saudagar vaale bayaan se 2007 main hi saaf ho gaya tha
 The same story was repeated 10 years later
 5
 Lack of CM leader: Congress could not present a strong CM face
 rajya ke diggaj netaa shankar singh waghela party se baahar hai
 There were leaders like Shakti Singh Gohil, Arjun Modhwadia in the Congress, but they themselves could not win the elections
 bharat singh solanki ne to chunaav bhi nahin ladaa
 Apparently there was no one from Congress in front of Vijay Rupani
 aise main muqabla sidhe modi banaam rahul ho gaya jisamen rahul kahin nahin tik paae
 6
 rahul gandhi par bharosa cameraajy kii janata main bijepi se bhale hi kuch naaraazgi thi, lekin vah piem modi ke mukaable rahul gandhi par bharosa kam kar pai
 Rahul Gandhi has been considered a reluctant politician till now and under his leadership the Congress party has suffered defeat in many states
 in chunaavon main rahul ne apni chhavi sudhari lekin wo modi ke mukaable zyada bharosemand nahin ban paae isliye logon ne congress kii bajaay bijepi ko hi chunaa
 7
 dharmik dhuvikaran or rashtravadacongress ke jaateey dhruvikaran kii tulana main bijepi ne dharmik dhruvikaran kii apni puraani paripati ko is baar bhi aajamaaya
 In Gujarat, any election takes place, the issue becomes hindu-muslim
 ram mandir mukademe ko taalane kii kapil sibbal kii koshish se jahaan hindu ekajutata ko badhaava mila, vahiin manishankar ayyar ke ghar hui meeting ke khulaase ke baadanarendra modine badi chaalaaki se yah prachaarit karnaa shuru kiya ki pakistan bhi gujarat main bijepi ko haraana chahta he
 Not only this, by propagating all the old tweets of Jammu and Kashmir leader Salman Nizami, BJP tried to prove that Congress leaders support anti-national elements
 isse deshbhakti or rashtrawaad kii bhaavana ne jor pakadaa or voter congress se nahin jud paae
 8
 shuruaati prachaar ke baad pichhadi congrescongress kaa prachaar abhiyaan shuru main to kaaphi joardaar rahaa, lekin baad main jab piem modi ne apana prachaar abhiyaan tej kiya to, rahul gandhi is res main pichad gaye
 This is the first time since the Lok Sabha elections that BJP has worked so hard for a state
 gujarat kii sabhi 182 siton ko modi ne chune kii koshish kii or 34 reliyaan kin
 Congress's 'vikas hai hai' campaign too could not get much acceptance because Gujaratis have faith in development
 9
 No effect of gst-demonetisation It seems that the businessman of Gujarat was upset and angry with GST and demonetisation, but when it came to voting, he could not leave BJP
 asal main vyapaaree samudaay paramparaagat rup se bijepi kaa voter rahaa he

 isi raajnneetik gahamagahami ke bich bihar bijepi ke adhyaksh nityanand raay ne kaha tha ki agar argedy nitish kumaar kaa saath chhodti he to bijepi baahar se samarthan kar sarkaar girane nahin degi
 Now BJP President Amit Shah has praised Nitish Kumar
 najuk mode se guzar rahe jadyu-rajd or congress ke mahagathbandhan ko jahaan bachaane kii koshish jari he, vahiin amit shah kaa taaja bayaan lalu prasad yadav kii chintaa badha sakati he
 Amit Shah is the founder of Jana Sangh in Delhi
 shyama prasad mukherjee par likhi kitaab (shyama prasad mukherjee- hij vijan of ajukeshan) kaa udghaatan karne pahunche the, yaheen unhone nitish kumaar or bijepi-jadyu sarkaar ke kaarykaal kii tarif kii
 In the program, he accused the Congress that it did politics of familyism, casteism and appeasement across the country, which the people of the country had to suffer
 jin rajyon main bijepi kii sarkaar bani parivaarwaad, jatvaad or tushtikaran kaa khaatmaa ho gaya
 Meanwhile, there is also a discussion in the political corridor of Bihar that JDU and CM Nitish Kumar are constantly pressurizing Tejashwi Yadav to get out of the cabinet
 haalanki argedy pramukh lalu yadav ne tejasvi ke istife se saaf manaa kar diya he
 Amid this political outcry, Bihar BJP President Nityanand Rai had said that if RJD leaves Nitish Kumar, the BJP will not allow the government to fall from outside
 ab bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne nitish kumaar kii tarif kii he
 While efforts are on to save the JDU-RJD and Congress's grand alliance undergoing a delicate turn, Amit Shah's latest statement may raise concerns about Lalu Prasad Yadav

 Shyama Prasad came to inaugurate the book (shyama Prasad Mukherjee - His Vision of Education) written on Mukherjee, where he praised the tenure of Nitish Kumar and the BJP-JDU government

 The states that formed the BJP government ended with familism, casteism and appeasement

 varsh 2011 main beijing main sardiyon kii ek subah safari suut main saje narendra modi (jo tab gujarat ke mukhyamantri the) china kii rajdhani main aaleeshaan lagjri hotel raddles ke lakadak banquet haul se hokar duusare haul main pahunche, jahaan china kii badi companiyon ke lagbhag 200 adhikari maujuud the
 As soon as that morning of 2011, Modi came to the Raffles ballroom, members of his team distributed cards printed in Mandarin Chinese script to the people present there
 narendra ab naalan the—ab ise sanyog kahie yaa jaan-boojhkar kiya gaya prayaas—naalan 17veen shatabdi main quing vansh ke lokapriy kavi the
 At that conference, Narendra Modi invited Len Yeon, vice-president of China's largest energy company TBEA, to the stage for a business speech, not a bureaucrat
 modi sunate rahe or leng ne gujarat main vyavsaay karne ke apane anubhavon kaa anoothaa pitara khol diya
 Leng explained the difficulties facing Chinese companies in India
 unhone kaha, “bharat kii samskruti ko samajhnaa kathin ho saktaa he, lekin modi sarkaar ne hamen har samasya se nibatane main madad di he
 "he built bridges praising Gujarat's good roads and uninterrupted power supply
" unka kahana tha ki sadakon main gadde or bijli main katautee bharat main kaam karne kii icchhuk chini companiyon kii sabase badi chintaa rahati he
 Leng told the end of his speech that his company intends to invest Rs 2,500 crore in Gujarat
 (40 karod dollar) nivesh karne kaa he
 In return, Modi promised Chinese companies "good governance, transparency and accountability"
 unka kahana tha, “ham do desh milakar asia ko vishwa arthvyavastha kaa kendriya manch banaaenge
 "he also said that he saw China emerging, having understood Asia's wider role in the world" long before economists, analysts and finance experts
 " duniya kii duusari sabase badi arthvyavastha ke kartadhartaaon ke liye duniya bhar ke rajdhyakshon, governron or netaaon se kaarobaari meljol aam baat he
 By 2020, China's external investment is estimated to reach $ 10-20 trillion, more than any other country
 isse beijing se nivesh kii chahat bad gai he
 But India's response to this development of China is somewhat slow
 kai chini companiyon main yah aam dharna he ki pichley dashak main bharat arthvyavastha ke kai kshetron main china kii bhagidaari ko lekar asamanjas main rahaa he
 According to central government figures, the total direct Chinese investment in India is around $ 500 million, while China has invested four times its amount in a country like Myanmar, although India is in desperate need of foreign investment
 2000 ke dashak ke antim varshon main bharat sarkaar kii tandra tuuti or usne rajyon ko china kaa rukh karne ko kaha
 But nothing was gained from the delegation visits, more and more they came to be known as bus tours
 aise main narendra modi kaa 2011 kaa daura ullekhneey hi nahin, yaadgaar bhi ban gaya
 Before returning home, Modi admitted that he was shocked by the response from the Chinese hosts
 2011 main pashchimi deshon main narendra modi ko sammanneey atithi ke rup main nahin dekha jaataa tha
 But in the Great Hall of People in China, he sat with a member of the Politburo of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC)
 vahaan aane vaale har prantiy netaa ko yah sammaan nahin miltaa
 Modi was told to this correspondent that the most surprising thing for him was that he was welcomed very warmly, every meeting lasted longer than the scheduled period
 khaas baat yah ki tab modi centre main sattarudh dal se bhi nahin the
 Now that Modi occupies the highest position in the country, China hopes that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not be different from the Chief Minister of 2011
 ve modi jo china ke daure ke dauraan desh bhar main ghume the, guangdong—yaheen se china ke aarthik sudhaaron kii shuruyaat hui thi—ke vishesh aarthik jone (esaijed) kaa daura kiya tha, saath hi duusare sthanon par bhi bade project kaa jayja liya tha
 Advisers close to the Prime Minister say that those visits left a deep impact on Modi
 rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal kehete hai, “modi ne china kii uplabdhiyon kii teen shabdon main vyakhya kii thi—speed, scale or skill
 Now Modi believes that India too should definitely benefit from it
 ”modi asarato, iskaa bharat ke china se sambandhon ke liye kya mahatv he? yaa phir dwipaksheeya sambandhon par iskaa kya asar hoga, jo aarthik maamalon kii bajaae ranneetik sarokaaron—jaise seemaa vivaad—ke boj tale dabakar rah gaye hai? china se bharat ke vyapaar sambandh pichley dashak main hi shuru hue hai
 After 1962 there was neither movement of people nor goods
 1988 main purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ke china daure ke baad halaat saamaanya ho paae
 But after another Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee's visit to China in 2003, trade relations ran at a galloping pace
 vaajapeyi china ke daure par gaye to donon deshon ke bich vyapaar 2-3 arab dollar ke aasapaas tha lekin varsh 2011 main yah 73 arab dollar tak ja pahunchaa tha, or china bharat kaa sabase bada vyapaar saajheedaar tha
 So, Modi's connection to the BJP has confirmed the notion in Beijing that despite being a nationalist party, the BJP is not against having trade relations with China
 jaisaa china ke ek purv rajdoot kehete hai, “china main yah dharna he ki bijepi sarkarein majboot hoti hai, isliye unke saath vyapaar karnaa aasaan he
 "china's goods, trade relations between the two countries in India were the two factors of flourishing — the huge demand for raw materials in China, as it was then preparing for the 2008 Olympic Games and the raw material for the infrastructure
 Was in dire need duusare, bharat kii mashinari or bijli upkarnon kii fori jarurat
 Today, one out of every four power plants in India belongs to a Chinese company, while big telecom companies like Huawei and ZTE of China have provided supporting tools in India's communication revolution
 lekin donon deshon ke bich paraspar nivesh bahut kam hua he jo aarthik sambandhon ko len-dein se aage le ja sake
 Much of the trade has been routed through Guangdong, the southern most prosperous province that left an indelible impression on Modi's mind and heart during his 2011 tour
 china ke saath bharat kaa louh ayask vyapaar jab sheersh par tha to lagbhag 1 karod ton asyak har maheene dakshin china sagar ke jariye bheja jaataa tha
 From there it would be sent to the huge port of Guangzhou, then to big companies like Sealink Corporation
 guangjheu ke baahar ceilink kii assembly lines bharat-china vyapaar sambandhon kii daastaan bayaan karti hai
 Ores from India are sized here as escalators, door handles, cabinets, staircases, railings and other accessories
 ceilink ke utpaada puure bharat main godarej label ke tahat beche jate hai
 Today, most of the baggage for new airports at Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai is supplied through sealing
 bharat se sansaadhan praapt karne vaali guangdong kii har factriyaan taiyaar maal—transfarmar se lekar telecom upkaran or cellphone se lekar plastic kii baaltee or furniture tak—bharat ko niryaat kar detii he
 The unbalanced equation: If Guangdong is a national factory in China, then the neighboring Zhejiang province is the Chinese market
 har saal yahaan 3
 More than 6 lakh Indian businessmen come to Yewu and buy a large number of goods — from power tools to pictures of gods and goddesses
 yivu main aane vaale har chaar videshi vyapaariyon main ek bhartiya hota he
 Last year, approximately $ 800 million worth of goods were sent to India from Yiwu
 bharat kii saste saamaan kii bhukh ne china main ek laghu arthvyavastha taiyaar kar di he, jo bharat kii hi jaruratein puri karti he
 The Indian market has led to the rise of entrepreneurs like Zhao Qingfeng in China, who have built a strong business by exporting pictures of Indian deities in their factories
 yivu ke hi udhyamiyon kaa maananaa he ki lagbhag teen darjan companiyaan bhartiya devi-devataaon ke chitra taiyaar karti hai, unamem se aadhi china ke i-be, taobao par soochibaddh hai jo sidhe bhartiya vyavsaayiyon ko chitra yaa murtiyon bhejti hai
 Zhao says, "our business rests on the Indian market
 ”lekin yah faltaa-phulataa or pratikatmak vyapaar sambandh ab ghatane laga he
 Since 2011, when trade had crossed $ 70 billion for the first time, it had been declining for two consecutive years
 pichley saal yah 65 arab dollar tak aa gira tha
 Worryingly, the trade imbalance continued to grow
 bharat kaa china ko niryaat bhi ludhakne laga
 65 to be held in the year 2013-14
 8 arab dollar ke dwipaksheeya vyapaar main bharat kaa niryaat 15 arab dollar se kam hi rahaa
 The reason for this slowdown is the decline in iron ore exports from India, which decreased from 110 million tonnes in 2009 to just 1 in 2013
 2 karod ton rah gai
 The immediate reason for this was the ban on mining in Goa and Karnataka
 lekin yah giravat dhanchaagat bhi he; ek dashak tak infrastracchar par baari kharch karne ke baad kshamta se adhik utpaadan kii vajah se china kaa steel udyog ab giravat par he
 As Yiwu businessmen complain, the factory model is also ending fast
 guangdong se gujaratmodi ke salaahkaar bataate hai ki unki yojana donon deshon ke bich asantulit or ladkadaate vyapaar model main sudhaar or amul parivartan karne kii he
 They want to end India's dependence on buying goods from China and want Chinese companies to invest in India and produce it here
 is tarah bharat-china sambandhon kaa buniyadi swaroop badal jayega
 This relationship will not only be a transaction, but Chinese companies will produce in India's dedicated industrial parks
 aise pehle park kaa khulaasa raashtrapati shi jinping kii 16-17 sitambar ko nai dilli or gujarat yatra ke dauraan ho saktaa he
 In short, Modi wants to try China's Guangdong model in Gujarat and elsewhere in the country
 beijing main to yahi raay he ki donon deshon ke sambandh jald hi aise bindu par pahunch sakate hai jahaan aarthik sambandh ranneetik matbhedon par baari padenge or bharat kaa pashchimi seemaa vivaad bhale hi sulajh na paae lekin sambandh tanaavpurn nahin rahenge
 Chinese officials and industry leaders believe that earlier strategic concerns limited the possibility of economic relations
 bharat kuch kshetron—jaise telecom main ranneetik vajahon se china ko pravesh nahin karne de saktaa to china ke saamne bhi baadhaaen hai—chini vyavsaayee vija milane main kathinaaiyon kii shikaayat hameshaa karte rahete hai
 Indian IT companies have always struggled to get contracts from Chinese state-owned enterprises
 2011 main modi ke saath ek baithak main bhaag lene vaale ek chini adhikari kaa kahana he, “ham ummid karte hai ki modi ke gujarat kii tarah shesh bharat bhi niveshkon ke liye anukool sabit hoga
 The general belief is that in the last decade India has been a 'country full of problems' for investment-seeking countries
 isaki pushti ek udhaaharan se ho jaati he
 China's billionaire construction businessman Liang Wenjen once complained to Indian officials that his construction company, Sani, invested millions of dollars in a construction job in Pune but was not allowed to travel to Pune in his private jet for security reasons 
 beijing nivasee tang lu china kii news agency shinhua main sampadak hai
 She says that Modi is considered an 'pro-investment' and 'economic reformer' leader in China
 yahi nahin, modi ko taqatvar netaa bhi mana jaataa he jo seemaa vivaad or tibet jaise masalon par upie sarkaar kii tulana main majboot kadam uthaa sakate hai
 "but he is considered a more practical leader on economic issues
 ”lekin sabase bada, sambhawatah sabase jatil kaarak jo modi kii china pariyojnaon kii safalataa tay kar saktaa he, vah he donon deshon main ek jaise majboot netaaon kaa apratyaashit or samaantar udai
 Xi Jinping, like Modi, is seen as a powerful leader in China, who has a realistic view of economic matters and does not want to compromise on national security
 shi jinping sudhaarwadi netaa shi jhengazun ke putr hai, jinhone guangdong or esaijed kii sthapana main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Beijing historian Jinang Lifan is of the opinion that Zhengjun emerged as the most powerful leader after Deng Xiao Ping in the 1970s
 ve din lad gaye jab ek bada kootnithik faisla lene ke liye nau sadasyeey paulitabeuro standing cameti kii aam sahmati leni padati thi, iske alaava piples libration army kii bhi sweekruti jaruri hua karti thi
 Zhang says, "unlike former leader Hu Jintao, Xi has more power, including the military

 How these two powerful leaders will connect with each other is uncertain
 dobhaal kaa kahana he ki donon netaa jab july main brazil main mili to ‘antarang’ najar aae the
 Xi had said that there was a commonality in the political journey of the two
 dobhaal kehete hai, “mujhe lagata he ki donon mahasoos karte hai ki ve saath kaam kar sakate hai

 Trusted sources said the UK discussed the idea of a joint conference system in informal consultation with members of the UN Security Council on Friday
 mana jaataa he ki britain ko dar tha ki kahin bharat ne do tihaai mat hasil kar liye to suraksha parishad ke liye bharat ke pratyaashee ko isije main nirvaachit hone se rokna bahut mushkil hoga
 However, Britain left the field at the last moment and the way for India's Dalveer Bhandari was cleared
 baharhaal bharat kii loktantric tareeke se hui is jeet ne vito kii shakti rakhane vaale paanch sthai sadasyon britain, china, france, rus, or america par bharat kaa dabadabaa kaayam kar diya he
 From Gujarat's Surat, such a strange love story has come out that the listeners can stand up and lose their trust with love
 prem main dhokhaa or jurm kii yah kahani aisi he ki yakeen karnaa bhi mushkil hoga
 a love story in which only a loved one beheaded his sweetheart
 aisa bhi nahin he ki vah koi saadhaaran premi tha yaa uskaa apni premika se ji bhar gaya tha
 Pritesh Patel, a resident of Timba village in Surat, was married, but his eyes once hit Bala in Mumbai, that he forgot everything and gave him his heart
 pritesh ne apni premika jyoti surajeet singh par karodon rupee lutaa daale
 He was soon to divorce his wife and marry her, but then something happened that all his love turned into hatred and he did what hardly any lover would want to do with his girlfriend
 kahani do saal pehle shuru hoti he, jab gujarat ke surat se pritesh mumbai ghoomane gaya tha
 While traveling to Mumbai, Pritesh reached once in a while
 baar main kai baar balaayein dance kar rahi thim
 The eyes of all the people were staring at the dances of the dancers and their stinging bodies
 tab wo unheen baar baalaon main se kisi kii ankhon main apane liye pyaar talash rahaa tha
 Then suddenly his eyes hit with these eyes
 pehali nazar main hi wo nazaren dil kii gahraiyon main utar gayi
 Then just as he got addicted to those murderers
 bas usee din usne faisla kar liya ki in nazaron par agar kisi kaa haq hoga to sirf or sirf usee kaa hoga
 Pritesh started going to the bar repeatedly to find an excuse to meet Jyoti and gradually he was able to make a place in Jyoti's heart
 donon kaa pyaar punap uthaa
 Now both of them started meeting
 punjab ke bhatinda kii rahane vaali jyoti surajeet singh darasal ek baar dancer thi or apane parivaar kii dushwariyon ko dur karne ke liye hi mumbai ai thi
 Here she used to earn and there her family grew up in Bathinda along with her younger sister
 bhalaa kii khubasurat jyoti ko andaaza bhi nahin tha ki uski garibi dur hone vaali he
 He is also such that he never thought
 karodon main khilne vaali thi jyoti
 Meanwhile, Jyoti met Pritesh Patel at the bar itself
 surat ke kamrej kaa rahane vaale pritesh patel ko jyoti is kadar bhai ki usne ek jatke main uski zindagi badal di
 Prateesh kept on looting money, she kept on blossoming
 pritesh ne jyoti ko gaadi dilaai, bangala dilaayaa, kapade dilaae, uske gale par manhagi jwaliri sajaai
 Both started planning for marriage
 pritesh ko jyoti kaa is tarah baar main naachna pasand nahin tha
 Pritesh got the job of dancing in Jyoti's bar
 yahaan tak ki jyoti ne mumbai main rahanaa hi chhod diya
 Pritesh relieved Jyoti of his work by assuring him to be together forever and 1 in Bathinda
 5 karod kaa aaleeshaan bangla kharid diya
 Now Jyoti's life was beginning to be cut off from luxury
 uske paas har keemtee saamaan tha, mahangi gaadi thi or gaadi ke liye driver bhi tha
 When Pritesh would have met Jyoti, he would have thrown lakhs of rupees for shopping only
 lekin phir usee ke gale ko usne hasiye se kaat kar alag kar diya
 Why did Pritesh do this while Jyoti came from thousands of km away to celebrate his anniversary
 beeti 27 disambar ko jyoti apane driver or uski patni ke saath pritesh kaa berth de celibratt karne timba pahunchi, jahaan donon ne milakar saalagirah kaa jashn manaaya
 After which the four people returned to Mumbai for 4 days and stayed in a hotel, where Pritesh also got Jyoti shopping for lakhs of rupees
 lekin iske baad pritesh apane gaanv main kele ke khet dikhaane ke bahaane jyoti ko waapas apane gaanv timba le gaya
 As soon as they reached these fields in Timba village of Kamrej, which ghost came on Pritesh and he became a killer with love
 jyoti ke driver sandip singh or uski patni nikita ke saamne hiusane hasiye se jyoti kaa galaa kaat kar dhad se alag kar daalaa
 It was difficult to understand why Pritesh, who had no love for Jyoti, gave him such a heartless death, despite all the plunder he was hoping for and only true love from Jyoti
 sawaal yah tha ki jisase pritesh ne naazon se mohabbat kii, uske har nakhre uthaae, har khwaahish puri kii, use itani beraham maut kyon? kyon uske gale se riste hue khun se uskaa kalejaa nahin kampa, kyon uski cheekh se uskaa dil nahin pighla, kyon uski bebas nazar par usko raham nahin aayaa
 It was not that Jyoti was filled with Pritesh's heart and wanted to remove him from the path
 shaayad nahin kyonki aapaki jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki jyoti se pyaar karne vaala pritesh na sirf shaadishuda tha balki jyoti se mohabbat kii vajah se hi wo apni bivi se alag rahata tha
 He was divorcing his wife so that he could settle down with Jyoti
 to phir usne use is berahami se maaraa kyon ye sawaal abhi khadaa hua tha
 There were so many ups and downs in this bloody story of Pritesh that the outcome of this story was bound to be bloody
 pritesh or uski bivi kii zindagi main jyoti wo banakar ai thi
 In whose love, Pritesh was so crazy that he was desperate to sacrifice everything on him
 magar asli kahani to iske baad shuru hoti he
 The story, on the other hand, was just the opposite
 jyoti pritesh se prem kaa naatak to kar rahi thi magar chori chhipe pyaar kisi or se karti thi
 The Jyoti for whom Pritesh was looting everything, he was doing Ayyashi on Pritesh's money, but was spreading the love of love to someone else
 yani pritesh or jyoti kii kahani main bhi ek wo tha or ye wo bhatinda kaa hi rahane vaala ek ladkaa tha
 But it is said that love and love do not hide
 lihaaza ek din yah raaj bhi khul gaya
 On December 27, Pritesh and Jyoti went out to celebrate New Year in Mumbai with their driver after celebrating Preetesh's birthday
 mumbai main ve ek hotel main kareeb chaar din ruke
 While living in Mumbai, Pritesh suspected that Jyoti secretly talks to someone else
 jab usne pataa karne kii koshish kii to maaloom chalaa ki jyoti kaa kisi or ladke se afaire chal rahaa he
 Pritesh himself felt in a closet
 donon main kaaphi kahasuni bhi hui
 But Pritesh's anger did not cool down, so he made a plan to kill Jyoti
 plan ke mutabik pritesh ne jyoti ko surat ke kamrej main kele ke khet dikhaane ke liye bulaayaa or mangalvaar dopaher kareeb 1
 At 0, Jyoti arrived at Timba with her driver and her wife
 jab ve kheton main pahunche to pritesh ne driver or uski patni ko car se utaar diya or jyoti ko akele ghumaakar laane kii baat kahkar kele ke khet main le gaya or vahaan hasiye se usne uskaa sar dhad se alag kar hatya kar di
 At the time when the police arrested the accused Pritesh, his T-shirt was soaked with blood
 haalanki abhi ye saaf nahin ho paaya he ki aaropee pritesh ne apane jurm kabuula he yaa nahin
 It is said that punishment is met in this birth
 pritesh ne jyoti ke liye apni patni se dagaa kiya to jyoti ne kisi or ke liye pritesh se bevafaayee kar di
 But this game of Pyaar Ishq and Mohabbat was very expensive for Jyoti

 These days, the picture of shame is seen more and more in the Connaught Place of Delhi
 shame isliye nahin ki conot place ab bhi tutaa-phuta he, balki isliye ki desh kii rajdhani kaa sabase viipi ilaaka hone ke baavjood yahaan chal rahaa saundaryikaran kaa kaam na jane kitni dedline ko munh chidhaa chukaa he
 The government is once again giving a new deadline
 alam ye he ki mukhyamantri shila dikshit jo ki conot place kaa kaam dekhne vaali agency endiemasi kii mukhiya bhi hai, jab conot place gayi to media or camaron ko bina bataae
 But the condition was to look the same as we saw it

 Moreover, the work of Horticulture and Inner Circle also looked incomplete

 pradhanmantri narendramodine mangalvaar ko bhopal main yojit kaaryakarta mahakumbh ko sambodhit karte hue ek baar phir upie sarkaar kii naakaamiyon ko ginaya
 Accusing the UPA government at the Center of being ignored with the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states, he said that the BJP will contest the next election on the issue of development, while it wants to seize power by breaking the Congress
 haalanki, piem modi ne apane kareeb 40 minute ke bhaashan main na hiayushmanbharat yojana jaisi duniya kii sabase badi yojana kaa zikr kiya or na hi unhonerapheld main ghotaale ke congress ke aaropon par hi koi jawaab diya
 Not only this, Madhya Pradesh, which is going to face the election, also kept away from his speeches and he did not even count the achievements of the three-time BJP government in the state
 piem modi ke bhaashan kii mukhya baaten:-pradhanmantri modi ne congress kaa majaak udaate hue kaha ki 125 saal puraani party aisi sthiti main pahunch gai he ki use gathbandhan ke liye chote dalon se 'bheekh' maangani pad rahi he
 He said that even if the Congress gets allies for the alliance, this alliance will not be successful
 -modi ne kaha ki unki sarkaar sabhi ke liye saamaajik nyaay main vishwaas rakhti he or uskaa 'sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas' abhiyaan mahaj naaraa nahin he
 - i have been in politics since 2001, before that i was working in the organization
 lekin aapane jamkar mere khilaaf jehar ugala he
 PM Modi further said that the more mud that has been spilled, the more the lotus has blossomed
 -10 saalon tak dilli main baithi upie kii sarkaar ne doharaa vyavhaar kiya, isliye ab madhya pradesh main inhen dharti par laa dena he
 It has had to struggle a lot in bringing Madhya Pradesh forward

 This attitude of the Congress will have to be understood by the aware citizens of the country
 -pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay kii jayanti kaa zikr karte hue modi ne kaha, bhaajapa aisa dal he, jo ekatm maanavvaad ko lekar chalata he
 Such a party is not in the world, which talks about humanity
 iske alaava piem modi ne congress ke parivaarwaad kaa zikr kiya
 Also, while talking about the rights of Muslim women, the issue of triple talaq was also raised
 haalanki, unhone baad main madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko janasevak or apana mitra bataate hue rajya main phir se bijepi kii sarkaar aane kaa daawa kiya
 That is, the entire speech of PM Modi from the land of Madhya Pradesh was limited to criticism of the central government and the Congress and the UPA government, and it showed complete preparation for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 bhartiya mahilaayein bhale hi genes or kurta-legings pahan len lekin sari ke prati unka lagaav kam nahin hota
 There is no better option than a sari to look special on special occasions or just like that
 vaise aapane ek baat jarur notice kii hogi ki kai ladies sari main bahut acchhee lagati hai or jabaki kuch ko dekhakar lagata he ki baat kuch bani nahin
 This difference is because the women know the secret of how to carry the saree properly
 masalan kisi julri pahanani he, blouse kaisaa hona chahie, maukey ke hisaab se sari he yaa nahin
 
 
 
 agar aap bhi sari ko apane warderob main special jagah detii hai or ise pahanane par har baar apana alag impressant chhodana chaahati hai to exparts ke sujhaaye in tips ko follow karen
 Believe it, after this you will all be called a sari star! Keep the clutch or small bundle purse in hand with the right pursari
 bada bag kabhi bhi sari ke saath na lekar chalem
 The sari itself is such a beautiful and delicate dress that it does not fit with a big or heavy looking purse
 agar aapaki sari haivi he to klach bahut work vaala na len
 With a light saree, one can keep a bright and work clutch in hand to make the look heavy
 pairon main kya pahanenyah baat sahi he ki sari pahanane ke baad footvirs zyada najar nahin aate
 But it also does not mean that you are allowed to wear whatever you want
 sports shoej
 
 
 So no one nor bullies, wear Kolhapuri chappal with saree
 vegej or kam hill vaale footvier (jinako kiton hill kehete hai) bhi sari ke saath na pahanen
 Heel footwear in plain and good look will be paired with saree
 
 Petticoat how many women wear flared petticoats (which are wider than the waist at the bottom)
 agar aapako sari main chalane kii zyada practice nahin he to ise pahanane se bachein
 Instead, wear a straight fit petticoat
 
 According to the figure of the blouse, if you really want to look beautiful in a saree, then get the blouse ready according to your figure
 masalan agar aapaki bahen moti hai to cat sleeves blouse na pahanen
 If there is fat at the waist, make the blouse a little longer
 dusron kii dekhadekhi style na taiyaar karavaaen balki yah dekhen ki aapako kya suut karata he
 
 gahanon kii dukaan na banemana ki sari jaisepramparik paridhaan ke saath khub sajane-sanvarne kaa man karata he
 But this does not mean that with a sari, you should ladle yourself with ornaments
 halke luk vaali sari ke saath kaanon main khubasurat se bade jhumake pahanen
 Or just put a good demand vaccine, ignoring the rest of the jewelry
 agar sari haivi he to patali chen, kaanon main chote tops or bahut sari chudiyon kii bajaay ek acha bracelate pahanen

 indvseng Mumbai Test: Bhubaneswar's throw hit the umpire's head, fell on the ground, everyone became worried bhagwaan kii puja se man ko shanti or aatma ko tripti milti he
 There is so much power in worship and meditation that it can fulfill all the wishes
 sachche man se kii gai ishwar kii aradha chintaaon ko dur kar ek aseem shanti kaa ehsaas karaati he
 But the worship of God during worship is not complete until the aarti of God is performed
 shastron main puja main aarti kaa khaas mahatv bataaya gaya he
 It is believed that aarti performed with true mind and devotion is extremely beneficial
 aarti ke dauraan gai jane vaali stuti man or vaataavaran ko shuddh or pavitra kar detii he
 Glory of Aarti - If a person does not know the mantra, does not know the method of worship but does the aarti, then God accepts his worship completely
 aarti kaa dharmik mahatv hone ke saath hi vaigyanik mahatv bhi he
 Performing aarti daily in the morning with melody is also beneficial for health
 gayan se sharir kaa system sakriya ho jaataa he
 It gives immense energy

 Aarti plate consists of cotton, ghee, camphor, flowers, sandalwood
 rui shudgh kapaas hota he
 There is no adulteration in it
 isi prakaar ghi bhi doodh kaa mul tatv hota he
 Camphor and sandalwood are also pure and sattvic substances
 jab rui ke saath ghi or kapur kii baati jalaai jaati he, to ek adbhut sugandh vaataavaran main fail jaati he
 This causes the negative energy present in the surrounding environment to run away and positive energy is circulated in the atmosphere
 aarti kaa mahatv-- aarti ke mahatv kii charchaa sarvapratham "skanda puraana" main kii gai he
 - Aarti is an extremely important function of the worship tradition of Hinduism
 - kisi bhi puja paath, yajna, anushthan ke ant main devi-devataaon kii aarti kii jaati he
 - In the process of Aarti, you place a flame and some special objects in a plate and rotate it in front of God
 - thaal main alag-alag vastuon ko rakhane kaa alag-alag mahatv hota he
 - But the most important thing is the praise sung with Aarti
 manyata he ki jitne bhav se aarti gaai jaati he, puja utani hi zyada prabhaavshaalee hoti he
 Rules for performing Aarti - Aarti cannot be done without worship, worship, chanting, prayer or bhajan
 - hameshaa kisi puja yaa prarthana kii samaapti par hi aarti karnaa shreshth hota he
 - In the Aarti plate, light can be lit either with camphor or ghee lamp
 - agar deepak se aarti karen, to ye panchmukhi hona chahie
 - Keep pooja flowers and kumkum with it
 - aarti kii thaal ko is prakaar ghumaayen ki kii akruti ban sake
 - Aarti should rotate at the feet of God four times, twice in the navel, once on the face and seven times on the entire body
 manokamana purti ke liye aarti-- vishnu ji kii aarti main pile phool rakhen
 - Keep red flowers in the aarti of Goddess and Hanuman ji

 ISI changed maneuver, said there is no threat from India
 Pakistani intelligence agency ISI has suddenly changed maneuver, saying that India was not a threat to it
 balki pakistan ko zyada khatra islamic aatankwaad se he
 The ISI is believed to have made this statement to improve its poor image around the world, as Pakistan is facing severe flooding these days and is not getting as much help from the international community as was expected
 iesai bharat main aatankwaadi hamalon kii sajeesh rachane or aatankwaadiyon ko shah dene ke liye badnaam he
 Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, the chairman of the moderate faction of the Hurriyat Conference, is willing to join any investigation, but accusing him of funding terrorist activities is "ridiculous" and "political vendetta"
 sanghathan ke purv adhyaksh evam kaaryakari sadsy abdul gani bhat ne buudhvaar ko yah bataaya
 The Hurriyat called an emergency meeting at the party headquarters in Rajbagh here on Wednesday to discuss the current political situation
 enie kii ore se mirwij ko poochtacha ke liye dilli bulaae jane ke mudde par bhi charchaa hui
 Talking to reporters after the meeting, Bhat said that an adverse environment is being created deliberately for the sake of harassing
 lagaataar barish ke chalate bihar main baadh main fanse logon kii madad ke liye centre sarkaar ne rashtriya aapadaa mochan bal (NDRF) ke 20 dalon ko bheja he or bhartiya vaayu sena ke helicopteron ko kaam main lagaaya he
 The National Disaster Management Committee (NCMC) led by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba reviewed the flood situation in Bihar on Tuesday
 bihar ke 16 jile jal pralay se prabhavit hai
 The central government has deployed 20 teams of NDRF in the state
 isamen 900 bachaav karmi shaamil hai
 a Home Ministry official said that six teams have been deployed in the capital Patna, where there has been heavy rains and waterlogging for the last three days
 bhartiya vaayu sena ke do helicopter bhi raahat evam bachaav abhiyaan main lage hue hai
 Explain that the Bihar government informed NCMC that 16 districts have been flooded due to excessive rains with the rivers being in spate
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki rajya sarkaar ne badi sankhya main logon se sthaan khaali karaae or bachaav tathaa raahat prayaas bhi chal rahe hai

 Injuries have been found on the body of Ram Singh, the main accused of Delhi gangrape
 ames main ram singh kaa postmortem puraa ho gaya he
 The full post mortem report has not been revealed yet
 shuruaati report ke mutabik ram singh kii maut fande main latakane se hui he
 But the doubt of his suicide has deepened due to the injury marks on Ram Singh's body
 ram singh ke gharavaale pehle se hi ye aarope laga rahe hai ki tihaad jail main unke bete kii hatya kii gai he
 The Tihar Jail Administration is claiming that Ram Singh, a key accused in the Delhi gang rape, committed suicide in his jail room but his family is dismissing the reason for his son's death
 parivaar or adaalat main ram singh kaa cese ladane vaale vakeelon kii daleel he ki ram singh kii khudakushi nahin balki uskaa murder hua he
 The collusion and conspiracy of the jail administration and other prisoners may be behind Ram Singh's death
 ram singh ke vakil e pi singh kehete hai ki uske saath jail prashasan or kaidiyon ke dwaara galat vyavhaar ho rahaa tha
 Ram Singh's family is facing embarrassment after his death on December 16, but Ram Singh's father is still demanding a CBI inquiry to expose the cause of his son's death
 saath hi ek sansanikhej khulaasa bhi
 Father Mange Lal says that he used to be raped
 isaki sibiai jaanch honi chahie
 Behind the doubts of Ram Singh's family and lawyers, many questions also arise on the argument of suicide
 ram singh kaa ek haath bekaar tha
 How can he commit suicide with just one hand
 ram singh ke kamare main 3 or log maujuud the
 Why did none of them lose sight of Ramsingh? ram singh kii lambaai kareeb saadhe 5 feet kii thi to usne jameen se 8 feet oonchi gril se fanda kaise pahunchaaya
 Why CCTV cameras were not installed around the room
 kamare ke baahar kisi guard ne ram singh ko faansee kaa fanda lagaate kaise nahin dekha
 Due to all these questions, perhaps Baba Ramdev is also demanding a CBI inquiry
 ram singh kii maut ke peeche kii sachai jo bhi ho lekin is ghatana ne ye zarur sabit kar diya he ki desh ke sabase bade or surakshit tihaad jail ke bheetar kaidiyon kii jindagi kii suraksha ko koi guarantee nahin he

 Date of Interview: 9 January Time: 10: 00 AM to 4:00 PM Eligibility: Graduation: h 108 Sector 3noida, Uttar Pradesh, India 201301 supreme court ne 1045 pej main sunaaya apana faislamuslim paksh jameen par sabit nahin kar paaya kabjacendre sarkaar ko 3 maheene main trust banane kaa adeshsupreme court ne aakhirkaar shanivaar ko ayodhya maamle kaa patakshep kar diya
 After a 40-day regular hearing in the last two months, the country's highest court cleared the way for the Ram temple in Ayodhya by giving a unanimous verdict based on legal evidence
 supreme court ke chif justise ranjan gogoi kii aguwai main justise ese bobade, justise divai chandrachud, justise ashok bhushan or justise abdul nazeer vaali paanch jajon kii peeth ne ayodhya kii vivaadit jameen par 1045 pej ke apane faisle main kai ahm baaten kahi hai
 The Supreme Court rejected the Sunni Central Waqf Board as well as the Nirmohi Akhara claim on the disputed land
 haalanki saal 2010 main elahabaad hoicourt ne ramalala virajman or sunni central vakf board ke saath nirmohi akhaade ko bhi baraabar jameen dene kaa faisla sunaaya tha
 The Supreme Court told the central government that the government can include the Nirmohi Akhara in the trust
 yah faisla sarvasammati se aayaa he, jisamen aasthaa yaa vishwaas kii jagah sabooton ko aadhaar banaaya he
 Now the question is arising that why the claim of Muslim side is rejected here? Jitendra Mohan Sharma, Vice President and Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court Bar Association on the matter, gave the following reasons for the Muslim side's claim to be rejected from the disputed land in Ayodhya
 
 
 
 1
 masjid ke dhaanche ke neeche se nahin mila islamic dhanchasupreme court ke senior edwocket jitendra mohan sharma ke mutabik is maamle main sunni central vakf board ne apni daleel main kaha ki babar ke shasankaal main mandir ko dhahaakar babari masjid nahin banaai gai thi, balki idgah kii jagah par banaai gai thi
 However, the 2003 report of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) made it clear that no Islamic structure was found from beneath the mosque, which proves that the mosque was not built on Idgah
 sharma ke anusaar eesai ne yah bhi kaha ki khudaai main masjid ke neeche se hindu dharm se jude saboot mili
 Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court Vinay Kumar Garg has also said that the Supreme Court accepted the ASI report as evidence under the Indian Evidence Act as evidence and the claim of the Muslim side was rejected
 2
 According to Jitendra Mohan Sharma, Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court, the Muslim side claimed ad possession in the Supreme Court
 iskaa matlab yah he ki muslim paksh ke paas vivaadit jameen kaa asli malikana haq nahin tha, lekin usne kabje ke aadhaar par malikana haq kaa daawa kiya tha
 The Muslim side argued that even if the Hindu side believes that the temple was demolished and built a mosque, then it has the right of adversary possession
 vahaan par saal 1528 main babar ke shasankaal main babari masjid banaai gai or muslimon kaa kabja rahaa
 The Supreme Court, however, rejected the claim of the Muslim side
 isse pehle elahabaad hoicourt ne bhi muslim paksh ke edwars pajeshan kii daleel ko khaarij kar diya tha
 3
 muslimon ne vivaadit puri jameen kaa nahin kiya istemalsenior edwocket jitendra mohan sharma ne kaha ki ayodhya kii puri vivaadit jameen kaa muslimon ne istemaal nahin kiya
 There were mosques in the inner courtyard of the temple, while Hindus continued to worship in the outer courtyard
 supreme court ne kaha ki muslimon kaa 2
 The entire tract of 77 acres of disputed land was not occupied
 muslim puri vivaadit jameen par namaaj nahin padhate the
 Apart from this, Namaz reading was also stopped many times
 vahiin, hindu pakshakaar jameen ek hisse main lagaataar puja karte the
 The court observed that Lord Rama was worshiped in the outer courtyard of the temple
 lihaaja puure vivaadit jameen par muslim paksh kaa daawa nahin he
 The court said that like the Hindu side, the Muslim side too has a claim
 lihaaja yah jameen ramalala virajman ko di jaati he
 Senior Advocate Vinay Kumar Garg says that if someone claims his possession over a land and ceases to use a part of it, his right is considered to be over
 4
 The Supreme Court Advocate Upendra Mishra said that the Babri Masjid was built in 1528 by the Mughal emperor Babur on the disputed land of Ayodhya or on his orders
 haalanki masjid banane kii taarikh se 1856-57 yani 325 saal se zyada samay tak vivaadit jameen par namaaj padhane kii baat sabit nahin hui
 Meanwhile, the Muslim parties were unable to produce any concrete evidence regarding the occupation of the disputed land
 supreme court ne kaha ki jahaan tak mandir ke bahari ahaate kii baat he, to vahaan par muslimon ke kabje kii baat ko sweekaar karnaa sambhav nahin he
 The outer courtyard of the temple was worshiped and occupied by Hindus, this is becoming clear
 5
 According to Advocate Upendra Mishra, the court found that a brick wall was built in the British period after communal riots in the year 1856-57, to prevent dispute between Hindus and Muslims and peace
 Can be installed
 iske baad mandir ke bahari ahaate main hinduon ko puja karne kii ijaajat de di gai thi
 Worshiping Lord Rama on the platform is a clear indication that Hindus have been continuously worshiping there
 jab ayodhya main vivaadit jameen par eent kii diwaar banaai gai, us samay hindu or muslim main se kisi ke malikana haq kii baat nahin kii gai
 This wall was built just to restore peace between Hindus and Muslims

 congress ko sandesh- sena kaa istemaal karne denobama ne kaha ki hamen bandook kharidne ke niyam sakht karne honge
 We should not enter into a long war in Iraq or Syria as ISIS wants
 yadi congress ko bharosa he ki ham iesas se yuddh kar rahe hai to use sainya bal istemaal karne kii ijaajat dene ke liye vot karnaa chahie
 This message given to the Muslim community, Obama said that the Muslim community should reject the ideology that spread the spread of ISIS

 Freedom is more powerful than fear

 After Mohammed Shahabuddin openly expressed his lack of trust in the leadership of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, senior RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh on Sunday said that he was not in favor of making Nitish the chief minister, but the grand alliance decision Had to agree

 The air hostess forcibly removed her

 His family and the crew of the aircraft started getting hot
 vimaan company kaa kahana he ki un sajjan ne gusse main airhostess ko tamaacha jad diya
 The plane was about to fly but the captain ordered them to get off the plane
 unhen naa chaahate hue vimaan se utarana padaa
 But the family went through a lot of trouble after that
 un sajjan kii patni ke alaava unke parivaar kaa ek nau saal kaa baccha bhi vimaan main tha
 They all had to get down
 uske baad unhen kisi bhi flite kii tikat nahin mili or ve bas pakadakar 30 ghante kii yatra karke dilli aae
 On the other hand, those gentlemen say that the aircraft was five hours late
 vah thak gaye the or seat par jate hi so gaye the
 In his sleep, he may have got a leg out, which the airhostess removed very ruthlessly
 unhen takalif hui to phir garmagarmee ho gai
 He said that his wife also apologized for the heat but the pilot of the plane ordered him to take off
 ab vah sajjn airlines se na keval maafee maangane ko kah rahe hai balki muaavja bhi maang rahe hai
 He says that he has been traveling in aircraft for 36 years and this has never happened to him

 25 days and 5 murders
 ham baat kisi psyco serial killer kii nahin kar rahe, jo har paanchaven din kisi kaa katl kar rahaa he, balki ham baat kar rahe hai dilli ensiaar ke un bujurgon kii, jo sirf bujurg hone kii vajah se kaatilon ko aasaan shikaar ban rahe hai
 Only 25 days have passed this month that more than 5 elderly people have lost their lives in Delhi NCR
 isse bhi zyada baichaiyn karne vaali baat ye he ki inamen se zyaadaatar apane ghar main akele hone ke dauraan luteron kaa shikaar bane hai
 When Ajay Ahuja, who lives in this house in Delhi's posh Lajpat Nagar area, returned to his house on Sunday evening, his feet trembled after seeing the inside of the house
 ghar lock tha or andar 86 saal kii bujurg maa kii lahooluhaan laash padi thi
 They were murdered, but this was not the first and only incident in recent times in Delhi when an elderly woman living alone in the house was a Kakatlahuah, but also 5 elderly people were killed in the same way
 is
 lajpatnagar main vimala ahuja ke sir par dhardaar hathiyaar se waar kiya gaya tha
 Seeing the condition of the house, it was clear that the motive behind the murder must have been looting
 kyonki vaardaat ke baad ghar se 10 lakh rupee bhi gaayab the, lekin jab police ne maamle kii chaanbin shuru ki to use is baat ke suraag mili kii kaatil ne ghar main frandli entry kii thi
 That is, he did not have to force any force with Vimala Mehra to get inside
 aise mempuliceko shaq he ki shaayad kaatil koi jaankaar hi ho
 Vimala lived with her husband on the first floor of the house, while son Bahu on the top floor
 jab unke saath ye vaardaat hui, tab ghar main koi nahin tha
 Now the police has started investigating this case by forming several teams, but with this incident it has become clear once again that the elderly in Delhi NCR are not safe at all

 lekin desh kii janata hindustan ko puraane daur main le jane ke liye katai taiyaar nahin he
 The people of the country are waiting for a new India in accordance with their dreams and all of us should try to fulfill the dreams of common man with collective efforts
 'unhone kaha, 'main hairaan hum ki nakaaratmakataa or virodhabhas is had tak gaya ki shauchalay, swatchta, jandhan, yoga kaa kaarykram or yahaan tak kii mek in india kaa bhi majaak udaaya gaya

 desh kii janata hindustan ko puraane daur main le jane ke liye katai taiyaar nahin hai

 Perhaps that's why Ghalib had said that Tumul Ghalib kept making this mistake, Tumul Ghalib kept making this mistake, the dust was on his face and i kept clearing the mirror

 --- from input language kisi se pyaar karnaa jitna aasaan he, use nibhaana utana hi mushkil hota he
 a relationship lasts only when equal efforts are made towards each other from both sides
 kai logon ke jivan main aisi paristhitiyaan bhi aati hai jab ek duusare ke prati pyaar hone ke baavjood unhen apane rishte ko todna padataa he
 These are the reasons for breaking up
 
 
 1
 It is often seen that when we love someone, we take that person for granted
 jis kaaran partner ko lagata he ki aapke jivan main unki koi jarurat hi nahin rahi he
 Due to not feeling their need, a person starts feeling inscrutable and gradually bitterness starts in the relationship
 jis vajah se log apane partner se pyaar karne ke baad bhi brallep kar lete hai
 2
 rishta tuutane kaa yah sabase bada kaaran he ki aaj kal log apane jivan main itane zyada biji ho gaye hai ki wo apane partner ko samay hi nahin de pate hai
 Due to which there is no communication between them properly and gradually the communication gap increases so that despite having love, people breakup
 3
 The foundation of any relationship rests on love and trust
 lekin jab pyaar ke rishte main bandhe do log ek duusare se bate chupaane lagate hai, to yah vishwaas tuutane lagata he
 Whether it is hidden or small, it hides the relationship
 jis kaaran naa chaahate hue bhi aapkaa partner aapse dooriyaan bana letaa he
 4
 apane partner kii kisi duusari ladki yaa ladke ke saath tulana karnaarishte ko todneke liye kaaphi hota he
 Comparing with another person makes the partner's heart ache as well as he feels insulted
 jis kaaran pyaar bharaa rishta tut jaataa he
 5
 samay- samay par apane partner kii tarif karne se rishte main mithaas aati he
 But some people never praise their partner, but make them realize their mistakes on small matters
 jis kaaran ek samay ke baad log chidchide hone lagate hai or apane saathi se pyaar karne baad bhi wo brallep kar lete hai

 Political parties are busy setting the equation to win the state's political bets
 bijepi satta main apni vaapasi ke liye bies yediurppa ke chehre ko aage karke utari he
 While the face of Congress in Karnataka is not the party president Rahul Gandhi but CM Siddaramaiah himself
 siddharmaiya rajya main apni satta ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye ek ke baad ek siyaasi bisaat bichaane main jute hai
 The Congress has made five game plans in the state, in which the BJP is completely stuck and the battle of Karnataka does not look so easy for it
 1
 The status of Lingayat as a separate religion Just before the assembly elections in Karnataka, the Congress government headed by Siddaramaiah has run a masterstroke by demanding that the Lingayat community be given a separate religion status
 lingayat samudaay ke log lambey samay se maang kar rahe the ki unhen hindu dharm se alag dharm kaa darja diya jaae
 The Government of Karnataka approved the recommendations of the Nagmohan Committee under Section 2D of the State Minorities Commission Act
 ab isaki antim manjuuri ke liye gend centre sarkaar ke paale main daal diya he
 Around 18% of the Lingayat community population in the state is considered to be the kingmaker
 yediurppa ke lingayat samudaay se aane ke chalate bijepi kaa ye majboot votbank mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, the Congress has tried to breach by giving different religion status
 bijepi kaa virodh lingayat kii naaraazgi kii vajah ban saktaa he
 2
 congress ke sang majboot muslim votbankkarnataka main musalamaanon kii aabaadi kareeb 13 fisadi he
 Congress is believed to have a strong hold on this vote bank
 mukhyamantri siddharmaiya ne apane paanch saal ke kaarykaal main musalamaanon ko baqayda saadhe rakhaa he
 North Karnataka is dominated by Muslims
 khaskar gulberga, bidar, bijapur, raichur or dharwar jaise ilaakon main muslim vot nirnaayak bhoomika main rahata he
 Out of the total 224 seats in the state assembly, about 60 are considered to be Muslim voters
 dakshin kannada, dharwar, gulberga wo ilaake hai jahaan 20 fisadi se zyada muslim voter hai
 It is also important that there are more number of Muslims in urban areas here
 shahari kshetron main kareeb 21 fisadi or gramin kshetron main kareeb 8 fisadi muslim jansankhya he
 Siddaramaiah is constantly trying to win the hearts of Muslims by sharply criticizing the RSS and BJP
 pichley dinon unhone bijepi, aresas or bajrang dal ko aatankwaadi bataaya tha
 Not only this, he has compared BJP with Kauravas while referring to Mahabharata
 iske alaava congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or siddharmaiya donon netaa rajya main muslim dharmik sthalon par bhi baqayda ja rahe hai
 3
 karnataka kaa alag jhandakarnataka vidhansabha chunaav kii siyaasi baaji apane naam karne ke liye mukhyamantri siddharmaiya koi kor kasar nahin chhod rahe hai
 The issue of territoriality is very important in South India
 siddharmaiya ne is baat ko bakhubi samajhate hue karnataka ke liye ek alag jhande kaa dizin rajya cabinet se paas karaayaa he
 Now he has put it in the court of the central government for constitutional approval
 laal, safed or pile rang kii pattee se bane is dhvaj ko ‘naad dhvaj’ naam diya gaya he
 In the middle of this flag, a two-headed mythological bird named 'gandha Bherunda' is placed in the middle of this flag
 4
 The caste equation of the Congress: Siddaramaiah has tried to improve the caste equation in a better way to save his fort in Karnataka
 bijepi ke lingayat votbank main send lagaaya
 Being an OBC community themselves, the state has a strong hold on the vote bank of the backward community
 soobe main kareeb 40 fisadi ke upar obisi samudaay he
 Apart from this, Mallikarjun Kharge of Congress is doing the exercise to control 20 percent Dalit vote of the state
 khadge congress kaa dalit cheharaa hai or loksabhaa main pratipaksh ke netaa
 Apart from this, 13 Muslim voters of the state are united with the Congress
 5
 The Supreme Court's decision to provide more water to the Kaveri river to the farmers has added to the decision on the Cauvery, making the political path of Siddaramaiah more easy
 kaveri belt ke jilon main congress ko iskaa raajnneetik phayda milegaa
 The decision on Kaveri will help in bringing the farmers closer to Congress
 iske alaava siddharmaiya apane paanch saal ke kaarykaal main kisaanon ko lekar kaaphi meharbaan rahe hai
 The farmers of the state waived loans up to Rs 50,000
 siddharmaiya ne is baar ke bajet main sinchai suvidha rahit kisaanon kii madad ke liye 'raiyat belaku' yojana kii bhi ghoshnaa kii he, jisamen varsha par nirbhar kheti karne vaale prayek kisaan ko adhiktam 10,000 rupee or nunatam 5,000 rupee prati hectare ke hisaab se raashi kii sahaayta sidhe unke bank khaaton main daali jaaegi
 This is expected to benefit about 70 lakh farmers

 The BCCI is badly trapped by allowing Virat Kohli to take Anushka Sharma along on the tour of England
 test siries main viraat kaa balla nahin chalaa or bharat ko bhi sharmnaak haar mili, iske baad se hi team india kaa postmortem jari he
 You will also be surprised to hear the plea made by the BCCI to allow Anushka to go along
 khabaron kii maane to viraat ne jab anoushka ko saath le jane kii maang kii, to team management iske khilaaf tha
 The board persuaded the team management to say that these two are going to get married soon
 bisisiai ke ek adhikari ne kaha, 'is baat ko lekar bahut duvidha thi ki isko (viraat or anoushka) lekar bhartiya media kaise riect karegaa
 The board told the officers going with the team that it was just a matter of days before the two got married
 'unhone bataaya, 'team management hairaan tha jab board ne england daure par viraat kohli ko anoushka sharma ko saath main le jane kii ijaajat de di
 But they were told that there is nothing to worry about as both of them are thinking about getting married
 or aisa pehali baar nahin ho rahaa tha, isse pehle team india ke ek captain kii garlfriend unke saath daure par ja chuki he
 Not only this, the board told the team management that Kohli will handle this whole situation well and the media will not even get to know about it, which proved to be completely wrong
 bisisiai adhikari ne bataaya, 'team management ne jab poocha ki agar media ne ye sawaal kiya ki upakptain ke saath anoushka england main kya kar rahi hai, to board ne kaha ki kohli media ko sambhaal legaa or kisi ko kuch pataa nahin chalegaa
 Regarding Kohli's poor form and Anushka's presence in England, he said, "cricket is not like football, cricket is played for 8 hours
" jab aapke dimag main of field kuch chalata rahata he, to nishchit taur par uskaa asar field par bhi padataa he
 At the same time, another official said that behind this whole ruckus is the relationship status of Virat and Anushka
 unhone kaha, 'agar ye donon shaadishuda hote to koi bhi kuch nahin kahata
 We are all aware of Indian culture
 viraat kii kharaab form ne media ko or mauka de diya
 If he had scored, no one would have made a mess of this

 Namvar Singh, as the king of the litterateur of litterateurs, had long ago established himself in such a way that anyone who learned to write, learned, printed, whether from Delhi or outside Delhi
 
 
 dilli aayaa to namvar kii dehri par maathaa tekna shaayad sahitya main tikne kii sabase jaruri anivaaryta sadrush ho gaya tha
 However, it is not known when and how it happened
 par haal tak yah dastur kaayam rahaa
 
 
 Whoever wrote first went to show Namvar
 unhone tarif kar di, to sthapit varanaa

 khabar ai namvar ke thik hone kii
 
 
 It was nice, Namvar was busy in beating age, disease, brain haemorrhage, death
 par kaash yah sthaayee hota
 
 
 i had a speech in his name as a child

 In today's era, people are not able to register attendance even during the last farewell at the local level
 khayr
 
 
 Namwar was the best critic of Hindi
 par unhone kavita main bhi haath aajamaaya tha
 It started in a way
 haalanki kavitaayen behatar bani nahin
 But could anyone say that? His stature was so great that people could not muster the courage to tell the truth by pretending to be reverential
 par sachai to yahi he ki namvar kavita ke liye bane hi nahin the
 He was a very good speaker and a heavy schooler
 vichaarak to vah the hi
 His lectures were accompanied by a rhythm of thoughts with the flow of language
 namvar singh, nahin dow
 Namwar Singh was the pinnacle of Hindi criticism
 unhen aalochana kii vaachik parampara kaa acharya kaha jaataa tha
 Like Baba Nagarjuna
 kuch had tak trilochan, yaa phir lok sankalnon ke liye devendra satyaarthee, gaanv –gaanv, shahar shahar gum-gum kisaanon, mazdooron, chaatro, naujavaanon, buddhijiviyon or vidwaanon kii sabhaaon, goshtiyon main apni kavitaayen, kisse, kahaniyaan sunaakar janatantric samvednaa jagaane kaa kaam karte, vaise hi namvar singh gum-ghumkar vaicharik ladaai ladate
 However, during the lifetime of Namvar Singh, some people used to say in a sarcastic tone that Namvar Singh does not write, he can only speak
 lekin jisane bhi namvar ke vyaakhyaan sune hai, vah jaanata he ki saalon se bina likhe bhi unhone hindi sahitya or aalochana ko apane vichaaron se kitna samrudh kiya
 Again, whatever Namvar wrote, it was also akin to introducing new norms in the field of history and criticism of Hindi literature
 baba nagarjun ne 28 may, 1988 ko varanasi main pragatisheel lekhak sangh kii ore se namvar singh ke saath varsh ke hone par yojit jalse main trilochan shastri kii maujuudagi kaha tha, “apane desh main aam janata tak baton ko le jane kii drushti se, pustakon se dur kar die gaye logon tak vichaaron ko pahunchane ke liye likhnaa jitna jaruri he, usase zyada jaruri he bolnaa
 This Jangam Vidyapeeth is more important than established (and even real) universities
 namvar is jangam viapeeth ke kulapati hai
 This school does not have any headquarters
 yah jagah-jagah jaakar gyaan kaa vitaran satr yojit karata he
 This is the wonderful thing of the store of luxury

 namvar singh ke shrotaaon main keval lekhak, aalochak, sahitya premi, hindi vaale, sahitya ke adhyaaapak or chaatr hi nahin balki duusari bhashaaon ke jigyaasu or vichaar-premi bhi shaamil rahe
 These opinion-lovers and inquisitors also included people who disagreed with the views of Namwar Singh
 is arth main dow
 Namwar Singh was not just a teacher of the oral tradition of Hindi criticism, but was an entire institution
 kattarpanthita, roodhiwaadita, andhvishwaas, kalawaad, vyaktvaad aadi ke khilaaf namvar singh ek sabal, sambhawatah hindi main aaj ke daur kii sarvaadhik shashakt aawaaj the
 At the international level, what imperialism is doing today against the nations, against cultural autonomy, against the consciousness of the people and democracy, very few people will have the latest knowledge in Hindi than Namvar Singh
 namvar singh vichaaron se marxvaadi the
 He accepted Marxism as the study method, as the method of thinking, as the guiding principle for bringing revolutionary changes in society, as the aesthetic principle that humanizes life and society
 unhone ek badi team taiyaar kii or chintan kii parampara ko badhaava diya
 In this ideological, academic, literary, cultural campaign, Namvar Singh on one hand kept cutting the pragmatism of thoughtlessness, on the other hand he also did public education on behalf of alternative ideology
 atmalochan marxvaadi adhyayan paddati or uski rachanaatmakataa kaa aavashyak ang he
 Being a Marxist, he also accepted introspection throughout his life
 unke kai vyakhyanon or lekhan main iske tamaam udhaaharan milte hai
 However, it was his importance whether he spoke in Patna or in Bhopal, in Benares or in Delhi, at home or in programs, his voice resonated through the medium of media across the Hindi belt
 shaayad isiilie satta unke vichaaron se dahalati thi
 There are many aspects of Namvar Singh's personality, in which his identity is different

 His opponents also accused him of racism and also said that the most dangerous aspect of Naamwar Singh's criticism style is that he could spoil the future of any writer or person, without any public statement
 yani apni nijee baatcheet se bhi vah hindi kii anek kaabil pratibhaaon ko gumnami kii gufaaon main le ja sakane main sakasham the
 But this is his one sided introduction
 unhone hindi ko jo diya, usase jo paaya vah yah bataane ke liye kaaphi he ki vah kya the
 Namvar Singh was a representative and spokesperson of Hindi literature, criticism and public awareness
 chandauli ke jiyanpur gaanv main 28 july, 1926 ko janma ek ladkaa kab bharatendu harishchandra, acharya mahaviraprasad dvivedi, jaishankar prasad, sooryakanth treepathi niraala, sumitra nandan pant, acharya ramachandra shukla, premachand, acharya hajariprasad dvivedi, dow

 baharhaal, alavida namvar! sahitya ajtak kii shradhanjali! Prashant Bhushan, a prominent lawyer and leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, has indicated his resignation from the party
 prashanth ne ndtv
 com has accused Kejriwal in an open letter written to Kejriwal that last year he was desperate to talk to Rahul Gandhi, so that AAP government could be formed in Delhi again with the support of Congress
 prashanth ne apni chitthee main kejariwal par aarope lagaaya he ki pichley saal vah congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se baat karne ko bekaraar the
 So that he can be persuaded to support the Aam Aadmi Party government again in Delhi
 iske liye aapane nikhil de se bhi baat kii thi, lekin nikhil ne aisa karne se saaf inkaar kar diya tha
 You have to understand that you will not be able to go very far with people who say yes
 hamaari party bahut se aadarshon ke saath banaai gai thi, aap or aapaki mandali ne un aadarshon ke saath dhokhaa kiya
 In the Aam Aadmi Party too, the culture of Supremo and High Command has now arrived

 Prashant Bhushan ends his letter by writing 'good bye and good luck'
 prashanth ne chitthee main kejariwal ko sambodhit karte hue kaha he ki unhone milakar jo sapana dekha tha, vah keval dilli main 5 saal sarkaar chalaane se puraa nahin hoga
 He has expressed the apprehension that if Arvind's behavior and attitude remains the same, it will not take long to convert this dream into a nightmare
 haalanki prashanth bhushan ne party chhodane ke bare main aupchaarik taur par to chitthee main kuch bhi nahin kaha he, lekin is open letters ko or khaskar iske ant main likhi line 'good bai and good lack' kaa party se unke istife ke sanket ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he

 Prashant wrote that they ran towards my father in such a way that they would kill him
 prashanth ne likhaa ki aapane hamen jawaab dene kaa mauka tak nahin diya or bina kisi charchaa ke voting karvaa lee gai
 He has alleged that most people who were not members of the Council were present in the National Council
 unhone swatantra videography na karwaane, lokapal ko meeting main aane kii ijaajat nahin dene or aloktantric tareeke se unhen va anya saathiyon ko rashtriya kaaryakarini se nikaal dene ke faisle par bhi du:kha jataayaa
 Later, he also described the video of Arvind's speech released by the party as edited
 prashanth ne bataaya ki kis tarah loksabhaa chunaav ke baad dilli main ek baar phir congress ke samarthan se sarkaar banane kii koshishen shuru hone ke baad unke arvind se matbhed shuru hue or kai baar kehane ke baavjood arvind ne unki baat nahin maani
 Even the decisions taken at the PAC and NE meetings were overturned by Kejriwal and he wished
 puri chitthee padhane ke liye yahaan clic karen
 
 
 On the other hand, warning party workers indirectly, AAP leader and Delhi's Information Technology Minister Parliamentary Secretary Adarsh shastri said that attending the meeting called by rebel leaders Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan on April 14 was considered as "indiscipline"

 At present, Sidhu is not making any political statement after the defeat of Congress in the Lok Sabha elections

 Later, in view of Navjot Singh Sidhu's displeasure, BJP made him a Rajya Sabha MP
 haalanki vah lambey samay ke liye bijepi main nahin tik sake or istipha dekar congress party jwine kar lee
 Vidhan Sabha elections were held and Sidhu was made a minister after the Congress came to power in Punjab
 tab se lekar abhi tak donon hi congress netaaon ke bich kuch na kuch ek-duusare ke liye bayaan aate rahe hai
 Amid a tussle with Navjot Singh Sidhu during the Lok Sabha elections, Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh had said that he would resign as Chief Minister if the Congress lost the elections in the state

 He has credited his title win to his coach Emily Moresmo
 dilachasp sanyog he ki marre kii is kamyaabi se kuch hi ghante pehle hi morasmo ne ek baby ko janm diya
 Morso is the only female coach among the world's leading coaches
 marre ne jokovich ko kariyar kaa 25waan masters khitaab nahin jeetne diya
 By the way, before winning the title, Murray had claimed the number 2 claim

 By the way, he has won the Masters title for the 11th time overall
 unhone apane khitaabi jeet kaa shrey apni coach emily morasmo ko diya he
 It is an interesting coincidence that just a few hours before Murray's success, Morsmo gave birth to a baby boy
 morasmo duniya ke pramukh khilaadiyon ke kochon main akeli mahila coach hai
 Murray did not let Djokovic win his 25th career title
 vaise khitaabi jeet se pehle hi marre ne number 2 par daawa sunishchit kar liya tha

 yah to sabhi jaanate hai ki vaigyanikon kii ajeebogareeb duniya aam aadmi kii duniya se alag hoti he
 But 54-year-old Ashok Sen's work is even more difficult to guess: s-durability, Takyon Condensation or Black Hole Entropy (got some sense?)
 lekin inhen sabake liye unke saathi vaigyanikon main unka bada sammaan he
 Two weeks ago, billionaire Yuri Milner telephoned to tell him about the first Fundamental Physics Prize (FPP)
 brahmad ke rahasyon par kaary karne vaale bhautikeevidon ko pahchaan dene kii chahat rakhane vaale milanar ne aadhikarik rup se iskaa elaan na ho jane tak is baat ko gupt rakhane kaa aagrah kiya
 But what is this? Did Sen not get surprised at all? He just smiled
 ek aise shaks ke liye yah aam baat thi, jo 13 rashtriya or antarrashtriya award hasil kar chukaa ho
 Almost every year since 1989
 lekin 31 july ko epapeepi prise vaali khabar ne duniya bhar main halchal machaa di
 Where the Nobel Prize in just 12 million dollars (6
 6 karod ru
 ) Is given at the same time a scholar in FPP is openly given $ 3 million (16)
 6 karod ru
 ) Are given
 aath anya vidwaanon ko bhi ye puraskaar die jaaenge
 The public utility of research is seen in Nobel, but here the idea / idea is the criterion
 aise vichaar jo is bare main hamaari samaj badha saken ki kya-kya sambhav he
 Where is the list full of people from the Ivy League, MIT, Princeton, Stanford or Caltech and the name of an Indian scientist sitting in an unknown research institute in a remote countryside in Uttar Pradesh to learn the deep secrets of the universe
 postcard jaisaa chota-sa, sundar or carch jaisaa shant harishchandra research institute (echarai) 1995 se hi sen kaa ghar bana hua he
 Situated 120 km from Varanasi and one hour away from Allahabad, this institute in Jhusi has been established with the money from the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India and is named after Kanpur-born mathematician Harishchandra
 sen ne apane research ke liye aisi alag-thalag jagah kyon chuni? ve bataate hai, ''isaki vajah thodi vyaktigat he
 i was working at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai, while my wife was at the Institute of Physics in Bhubaneswar
 iity, kanpur main mere guru rahe ech
 s
 mani jab yahaan ke nideshak bane to unhone hamen bulaayaa or bas ham aa gaye
 But this is one aspect of the story
 sen ke liye prayogshaala to unke dimag main hi he
 They show their talent in front of their Apple Mac, but with the same ease can sit anywhere in this center and think about science
 tii-shart or cargo pahane apane anushaasit offis main baithe sen kehete hai, ''main kisi bhi samay kaam kar saktaa hum
 Sometimes i work for 16 hours at a time
 '' jab unka dimag thak jaataa he to campus main tahalne lagate hai, i-mail dekhte hai, patni se vigyaan par baat karte hai, bazaar chale jate hai yaa khaanaa banane main lag jate hai
 In his words, the beauty of string theory is that it is all about mathematics
 iske liye aapako sansadhano yaa prayogshaala kii jarurat nahin hoti
 Sit in the room and calculate
 ''bhautikee ke zyaadaatar shodhakaryon main siddhantkaar ko kathor prayogon ke jariye apni pariklpana kaa pareekshan karnaa padataa he
 But this state-of-the-art field remains largely far from any experimental confirmation and is often criticized as being more philosophy than science
 lekin sen in vichaaron se sahamat nahin
 "the beauty of science is in imagining much more than we can prove, and string theory gives you a completely different interpretation of the universe
" ''string siddhant he kya? ''maanav itihaas ko hameshaa hi pareshaan karte rahane vaale kai sawaalon main se ek yah he ki ham kya hai or hamaare aasapaas kii har cheez kisase bani hui he?'' aadhunik vigyaan ne padaarth ko uske sabase chote tukdon: anu, parmaanu, electron, proton, neutron, quark aadi main baantkar iskaa jawaab diya he
 According to string theory, if we go more closely and test these particles (which is beyond our technical ability at the moment), we will find that eventually these materials are made of a small, vibrating loop that is much thinner rubber bands
 As it happens
 ganit ke aadhaar par string siddhantkaar maanate hai ki brahmad 10 ayaamon main bana hua he, na ki teen ayaamon main, jaisaa ki rosemara kii jindagi main dikhataa he
 Seven of these dimensions are beyond the reach of the human eye
 sen yaad karte hai, ''1980 ke dashak main stony brooks (america) main ek shodhakarta ke rup main kaam karte hue kaaltech ke jon shwarge or maaikel green ke paper padhane ke baad main isaki ore aakarshith hua
 "his interest has always been in understanding the gravity force that keeps us on earth
" ''yah ek aisa buniyadi bal he jisko acchhee tarah se samaj nahin gaya he
 However, in conventional physics it is believed that this force does not move between atomic particles
 unke shabdon main, ''mujhe lagata tha ki duniya kii hamaari samaj tab tak puri nahin hogi jab tak hamaare paas aisa siddhant nahin hoga jo gravity par bhi lagu ho
 "they found it in string theory
 ''isse ek nai ummid jaagi ki yah ek aisa siddhant ho saktaa he jise har buniyadi bal ke saath ekikrut kiya ja sake or jo prakruti ke liye nirnaayak siddhant ho
 By choosing string theory, Sen coordinated two inherited things in a way
 unhen vigyaan se prem apane pita anil kumaar sen se viraasat main mila tha jo kolkata ke scottish carch college main physics padhaate the
 He says smilingly, "I started dreaming of becoming a 'scientist' even before knowing what scientists do
 ''unhen badi sankhya main lagaataar bacchon ke liye bengali or angreji main likhi vigyaan kii lokapriy kitaaben padhane ko milin
 He explains, "I grew up in Calcutta in the 1970s, where every promising student is encouraged to study physics
" presidency college ke mere sabhi dost skool kii pariksha ke topper the or physics ke prati baari dilchaspee rakhte the
 He was fond of philosophy from mother Gauri
 string siddhant main unhen in donon kaa samanvay karne kii gunjaaish mili
 From the very beginning, Sen was striving to correct the shortcomings of string theory
 ''ise praayogic taur par siddh karnaa kathin tha, isliye maine aise sawaalon par dhyaan kendrit karnaa shuru kiya jo ganitiya asangatta ko dur kar paroksh rup se siddhant kii pushti kar saken
 Every article published since the mid-nineties attracted scholarly attention and received praise
 chaahe vah kanon main es-duality kaa siddhant ho, jo paanch pratispardhi siddhanton ko ek chhatari ke neeche lekar aayaa or blueole disorder ke prati unka yogadan, jise lekar kaaphi utsaah dekha gaya
 Any moments like Eureka? "I remember the chance to find the M1 equals M2 equation on the s-durability in February 1994
 main jaanata tha, yah kaaphi mahatvapurn sabit hone vaala he
 "away from the noise, Sen and his wife Sumati Rao (professor of Solid State Physics at HRI) continue to inspire each other
" unke kshetra alag hai par varshon pehle america main padhane ke dauraan ve is maamle main talmail kaayam kar chuke hai
 Sen first shows his work to him and similarly he also shows his work to Sen first
 duniya bhar main ve ek saath ghoomte hai or prayag main lagane vaale kumbh meley main doston or parivaar kii khatirdaari karte hai
 The rest of their time is spent in research
 sen kaa ab bhi ek sapana he, ve mehnat kaa fal ek din prayogshaala main sabit hote dekhnaa chaahate hai
 The CBI has made a shocking disclosure in the Pradyuman murder case

 kendriya mahila evam bal vikaas mantri menka gandhi ne kaha ki police ne jaldbaaji main invastigeshan kiye bagaiyr hi karrwai kii, jiskaa ye nateeja niklaa he
 There have been many such cases, in which police negligence has come to the fore
 police ne is maamle ko jaldi solve karne ke liye kisi papet ko pakad leti he or agar wo garib he to police kaa kaam or bhi aasaan ho jaataa he
 Maneka Gandhi said that HRD Ministry is taking several steps in the future if such cases do not happen
 menka gandhi ne kaha ki hamane do saal pehle jeje act banaaya tha
 Under this, if a 16-year-old child has committed a crime, he will be considered a criminal
 mujhe lagata ki police ne is maamle main koi bhi khojbin nahin kiya tha
 In just ten minutes, the case was shown to be solvent
 wo bhi bina sabooton ke aadhaar par

 saansad ne iske liye baqayda kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri ramesh pokharial nishank ko chitthee likhi
 Madurai MP a Venkatesh has written a letter in this regard to Human Resources Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank

 e venkatesh ne pratikriya avadhi ke vistaar kii maang karte hue kaha ki lagbhag 484 pejon vaali rashtriya shiksha niti tamil sahit rajyon kii bhashaaon main uplabdh nahin he
 He said that the wrong message is going from this that only feedback is being sought from those who know Hindi and English, while those who do not know hindi-english are being ignored
 venkatesh ne kaha ki sawaal yah bhi he ki report pesh karne main deree kyon hui jabaki cameti ne disambar main hi apana kaam puraa kar liya tha
 The MP said that the committee had signed the report on 15 December 2018 while it had to wait till 31 May 2019 to submit it to the Ministry of Human Resource Development
 in dastavejon ko saadhe paanch maheene tak rokane ke kya kaaran hai, iske bare main kabhi bataaya nahin gaya
 After the displeasure of the states of South India, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) had removed compulsory teaching of Hindi from the draft National Education Policy

 yaheen se shuru hua dasharath maanjhi kaa intkaam
 22 years of hard work: Dasharatha Manjhi, torn by the grief of his wife, decided to give all his strength and hit the mountain chest
 lekin yah aasaan nahin tha
 Initially he was called insane
 dasharath maanjhi ne bataaya tha, 'gaanvvaalon ne shuru main kaha ki main pagal ho gaya hum, lekin unke taanon ne meraa hausala or badha diya' An explanation has been issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on the Amarnath Yatra
 engiti ne kaha he ki amarnath ko lekar aadesh kii galat reporting kii gai he
 The Tribunal, in its clarification, has said that there is no ban on chanting and aarti
 keval shivlinga ke saamne hi shanti banaae rakhni chahie
 Along with this, people have to collect their belongings before the cave stairs
 or gupha main pravesh ke liye ek line main chalanaa hoga
 The NGT has made it clear that they have not declared the Amarnath cave a silent zone
 bas tirth yatriyon kii suraksha or aaraam ke liye kuch nirdesh die gaye hai
 VHP said that insult of Hindus should be told that after the directives were issued by NGT on Wednesday, Vishwa Hindu Parishad called it an insult to Hindus
 saath hi engiti se apane aadesh ko waapas lene kii maang kii thi
 Explain that during the Amarnath Yatra, devotees go to the shrine shouting Lord Shiva
 saath hi kai jagahon par ghantiyaan bhi bajaate hai
 This step has been taken by the NGT to curb incidents of land slides
 yahi nahin aadesh main yatriyon ke mobile phone par bhi bain lagane kii baat kahi gai he
 The NGT, while giving the verdict, said that some temples are forbidden to speak and there are silence zones, such as Bahai Temple, Tirupati and Akshardham
 amarnath main dhwani ke kaaran land slide kaa khatraavahin amarnath main dhwani ke kaaran landslide kaa khatara bad jaataa he
 In such a situation, according to the NGT, keeping the environment very sensitive and the sensitivity of glaciers in the area, there should be no noise and the number of passengers should also be limited
 engiti main yachika dene vaale vakil aditya singhla ne ajtak ko bataaya ki engiti ne yah aadesh vahaan ke ichological strecchar ko dekhte hue die hai, jisase land sliding kii ghatnaayen na bade
 When hundreds of people play bells or chant, then the environment is damaged
 NGT ne amarnath board ko lagaai fatkarapako bataa den ki pichley maheene engiti ne amarnath shrin board ko shraddhaluon ko paryaapt buniyadi dhaancha uplabdh na karaane or is maamle main disambar ke pehle hafte main states report na saunpane ko lekar fatkaar lagaai thi
 The order has been issued by the NGT only after the Amarnath Shrine Board was reprimanded
 engiti ne aadesh main kaha ki shrin board ko yah tay karnaa chahie ki log aakhri check post se amarnath gupha tak ek hi line main jaaen
 The NGT said that the Shrine Board should arrange that the passengers can keep their luggage safely, BJP leader Bagga challenged the NGT, although the decision has also been disputed
 bijepi sarkaar ne is faisle ko hinduon ke khilaaf bataaya
 bjp's Delhi Pradesh spokesperson Tejinder Pal Bagga said that he would go on the Amarnath Yatra and would bam bam bhol and hara har mahadev

 a very important question is being asked about the future: what will happen if antibiotics become ineffective? The World Health Organization (WHO) has already warned of this serious and fast-growing and global threat in 2010 itself

 With the ABR becoming a period of 100,000 people in the US, 80,000 in China and 25,000 in Europe every year, the WEF considers it one of the major threats to human health, leaving the world not ready to deal with it

 The pandemic epidemic was a dangerous bacterial gene, a little difficult to name — New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1), which first caught public attention in 2010 for ABR

 NDM-1 makes bacteria resistant to all known antibiotics, even to carbapenem used as the last weapon

 Naming the germ after Delhi was seen as an insult and the report was dismissed as a thought-provoking attack on the fear-mongering and booming medical tourism industry of India

 The biggest source of infection is the umbilical cord

 They are also exposed to germs due to the increase of drug resistant bacteria in hospitals
 agar yah bacteria rakt main pravesh kar jaataa he to maut kaa khatra bahut zyada bad jaataa he
 "the increasing number of microbes is revealing a frightening picture from everywhere in India: ABR causes babies to die in the first four weeks; No known antibiotics are affecting TB patients in metros; ABR infarctions are increasing in hospitals; Killer germs in taps and drains in large cities; Antibiotic pollution in rivers from drug waste; Use of antibiotics on domestic animals and crops, which increases the risk of resistant bacteria

 club) on May 21, 2018 at 6:07am PDT The results achieved after the completion of each work provide us with a unique opportunity to take practical steps for future by thinking rationally about that work
 civil seva pariksha ke pichley chaar saal ke parinaamon ko is ek mahatvapurn tathyayukt avasar ke rup main dekha janaa chahie
 According to the just announced results of the civil service, Kanishka Kataria is from the scheduled caste who topped this country's toughest and most prestigious all India exam
 saal 2015 kii bhi isi pariksha main jis saadhe baaise saal kii tina dobi ne top kiya tha, ve bhi aarakshan ke isi samooh se thim
 Certainly India can take pride in this by basing these two results that it has made the socially, culturally and economically backward classes more empowered by making reservations so that they can compete with anyone independently and achieve their superiority Can prove saath hi yah bhi ki aisa na keval purushon ke saath hi hua he, balki mahilaon ke saath bhi hua he
 My blog is considering these results and taking some new policies and new initiatives for the future
 nitiyaan sarkaar ke haath main hoti hai
 But the initiative can also be taken at the individual level
 aarakshan varg se hone or topper hone ke saath hi tina or kanishka main kai anya bahut samaantaayen ye hai ki donon ke pita ucch sarkari padon par hai
 Tina's mother was also equivalent to her husband
 yani ki jatigat aadhaar par bhale hi ye arakshit varg main the, lekin us jatigat aadhaar ke aadhaar se donon kaaphi pare ja chuke the
 While Tina studied at a very good college in Delhi, Kanishka was a student of IIT Mumbai
 donon kii parvarish bhi dilli or jaipur jaise achche evam sarvasuvidhayukta nagaron main hui
 All these naturally raised him above his class and made him a member of a special class of the country
 isliye in donon ke liye 'aarakshan' shabd kaa prayog karnaa na keval is shabd ke bhavatatv ko hi pradooshit karnaa he, balki jo sach main uske hakdaar hai, unka apmaan karnaa bhi he
 Because they are not like this
 main aisa iske baavjood kah rahaa hum ki vaidhanik rup se main puri tarah galat hum
 This is a good concrete occasion when all the major political parties of the country should sit together and discuss the question of reservation of this class
 yah baatcheet aarakshan ko banaaye rakhane yaa ise samaapt karne par nahin hogi balki is par ho ki kaise uske aadhaar ko vyapak banaakar vyaavhaarik kiya jaye
 For this, they already have an example of other backward class creamy layer
 anyathaa pichley 70 saalon main in virgon main bhi ab aise kai tapu nirmit ho chuke hai, jinaki thaaliyon main hameshaa machhliyaan aati rahengi or vah bhi, unke apane hi varg ke logon kii thaaliyon ke badalen
 The second is individual level
 ek afasar ke bete hone ke naate kanishka is sachai ko bahut acchhee tarah se jaanate honge ki system kaa hissaa banakar system ko badla nahin ja saktaa
 If they don't believe, they can ask Gaurav Aggarwal, the 2013 topper of their own city
 gaurav agarwal ne teen saal kii hi naukari ke baad apni website par ek lekh main apni bechaargi ko bahut hi bebaaki ke saath vyakt kiya tha
 Or they are IAS o of Chhattisgarh cadre of 2005 batch
 pi
 Ask Chaudhary, who thought it was right to go to politics for change
 khayr, meri kanishka se ek apil he
 Politicians will do when they do
 aap parivartan ke liye ek kaam kar sakate he, or vah bhi turant
 That is to say publicly that "I declare in the larger interest of the people of my class that my coming generation will not take advantage of reservation
" ” yadi aapke pita ne yah ghoshnaa kii hoti, to aapke karier par ratti bhar bhi fark nahin padaa hota
 Believe that if you do this now, your children's career will not be adversely affected
 or iske saath hi aarakshan ke maamle main ek nai kranti kii shuruyaat ho sakati he
 You will become its leader
 aapkaa yah kadam samaaj ke liye bahut hitkaari hoga

 police ne ek bayaan main kaha ki is lutere ne handnburg sthit ek bank ko sthaneey samyaanusaar shaam chah baje iske band hone se thik pehle lut liya 
 Police believe that this incident may have been carried out by the same person who has been carrying out such incidents of looting in banks by wearing Obama's mask for the last two years
 is vyakti ne bandook ke bal par bank karmchaariyon ko dhamkaaya or dhan dene ko kaha

 skanda puraana ke anusaar prayek maah kii donon pakshon kii trayodashi ke din sandhyakaal ke samay ko 'pradosh' kaha jaataa he or is din shivaji ko prasann karne ke liye pradosh vrath rakhaa jaataa he
 According to a legend described in the mythological story of Pradosh Vrata, in the ancient times, a widowed Brahmini went to take alms with his son and returned in the evening
 ek din jab vah bhiksha lekar laut rahi thi to use nadi kinare ek sundar balak dikhaai diya jo vidarbha desh kaa rajkumaar dharmagupta tha
 Enemies had killed his father and annexed his kingdom
 uski mata kii mrityu bhi akaal hui thi
 The Brahmin adopted the child and raised him
 kuch samay pashchaat brahmani donon baalkon ke saath devayog se dev mandir gai
 There he met the sage Shandilya
 rishi shandilya ne brahmani ko bataaya ki jo balak unhen mila he vah vidarbhadesh ke raja kaa putr he jo yuddh main maare gaye the or unki mata ko grah ne apana bhojan bana liya tha
 Rishi Shandilya advised Brahmani to perform Pradosh fast
 rishi ajna se donon baalkon ne bhi pradosh vrath karnaa shuru kiya
 One day both the boys were walking in the forest when they saw some Gandharva girls
 brahman balak to ghar laut aayaa kintu rajkumaar dharmagupta 'anshumati' naam kii gandharva kanya se baat karne lage
 Gandharva Kanya and Rajkumar become fascinated at each other
 kanya ne vivaah hetu rajkumaar ko apane pita se milwane ke liye bulaayaa
 The next day when he again came to meet Gandharva Kanya, Gandharva Kanya's father told that he is the prince of Vidarbha country
 bhagwaan shiv kii ajna se gandharvaraj ne apni putree kaa vivaah rajkumaar dharmagupta se karaayaa
 After this, Prince Dharmagupta with the help of Gandharva army regained Vidarbha country
 yah sab brahmani or rajkumaar dharmagupta kepradosh vrath karne kaa fal tha
 According to Skandpuran, a devotee who converts after Shivpuja on the day of Pradoshvrat and listens to or recites the story of Pradosh fast never suffers impoverishment for a hundred births

 The Congress had a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for serving the 'gujarat model of development' and former Finance Minister p Chidambaram said that 'he considers himself the Prime Minister of Gujarat'
 ' Chidambaram told reporters, 'he cannot expel Gujarat from within
 vah pradhanmantri hai, is baat se hat nahin sakate
 Therefore, he has struck a balance by thinking of himself as the Prime Minister of Gujarat
 main samajhataa hum ki vah ab bhi gujarat ke siem or bharat ke piem ke bich bante hai
 i understand that he is standing on the PM of Gujarat
 ' The senior Congress leader said that Modi is still in the 'color before May 26' and is campaigning in Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections in the same way as if he is the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 chidambaram ne kaha, 'vah ab gujarat ke mukhyamantri nahin hai balki bharat ke pradhanmantri hai
 So people have the right to ask them what is the achievement during 120 days in the government
 ' unhone modi or anya bhaajapa netaaon ke in daavon kii bhi khilli udayi ki gujarat vikaas ke maamle main maharashtra se aage he
 Chidambaram said, "there is nothing in support of the claim that Gujarat is better than Maharashtra
" isamen koi shaq nahin ki maharashtra bharat kaa agrani audyogic rajya he
 It attracts the most domestic and foreign investment
 ' Chidambaram said, 'it would be unfair and shameful to malign Maharashtra
 yah kahana behuudagi he ki maharashtra main pichley itane saal main kuch nahin hua
 He said that 'it is unfortunate that someone comes to Maharashtra and tries to sell' Gujarat model 'here
 ' Chidambaram claimed that the Modi government is running several projects of the UPA government by changing the name
 unhone kaha, 'hamaara nirmal bharat abhiyaan tha
 He changed its name to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan

 To be given to the applicant within ' It is to be noted that the RTI applicant had sought a copy of all the communication between the PMO and the Government of Gujarat between February 27, 2002 and April 30, 2002 on the law and order situation in the state
