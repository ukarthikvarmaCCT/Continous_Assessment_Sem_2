 White saakhi, based on the dialogue between painter Manish Pushkale and art-penetrating Piyush Daiya, it is difficult to decide whether this book is entirely based on painting or focuses on a very unique configuration of language, or by two sculptural contemporary artists
 Has some spiritual peak
 yadi ham ise chitra-bhashaa or kala-tap kii shabdaawalee main parakhen to paaenge ki bhashaa or rangon ne ek aisa amoort parantu vismayakari sammohan rach diya he, jise apane anupasthit prashnon se daiya or apni upasthiti ke canvas se pushkale behad sundar dhang se ukerte hai
 21 December 2011: See India Today in pictures
 This book plays such a beautiful game between presence and absence, between colors and words, between society and spirituality, and between the express and the latent that sometimes it seems like we are codenamed

 Perhaps this is also the most beautiful thing in this book that the mutual interaction between two youngsters has created such a large complex of spontaneity, which, in its esoteric sense, appears to us very much like Kabir
 pushkale subhashiton, sukhtiyon or mitkathanon ke aadhaar par bhashaa kii aisi chahnush upasthiti rachate hai, lagata he jaise vah apane canvas par rang nahin, shabdon kii koi parat laga rahe hon

 The sex scandal that rocked Indian hockey took a new turn on Monday when the Sports Ministry decided to launch an investigation against suspended coach MK Kaushik himself while the coach threatened legal action against the hockey organization to discredit him
 
 khel mantralay ne apni yon utpeedan samiti ko in aaropon kii jaanch karne kaa aadesh diya
 But Kaushik, who resigned from the post following these allegations, targeted Hockey India and said that the sports body is trying to trap him despite no evidence against him
 haaki khilaadi ranjita devi ke haal main canada or china daure ke dauraan yon utpeedan kii shikaayat haaki india se karne ke baad kowshik ne istipha de diya tha
 Hockey India has already referred the matter to Delhi Police after considering the report of the five-member inquiry committee set up to investigate the matter following Ranjita's complaint
 mantralay ne ek bayaan main kaha, ‘mantralay ne apni yon utpeedan samiti ko aadesh dekar emke kowshik ke khilaaf haal main lage aaropon kii jaanch karne ko kaha he
 The committee will follow the same procedure laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the Visakha case
 ’mantralay ne saath hi kaha ki samiti haaki india ke us panel kii report par bhi gaur karegi jo sanstha ne kowshik ke khilaaf aaropon kii jaanch ke liye gathit kii thi
 However, the ministry has not received its report yet
 bayaan main kaha gaya, ‘haaki india kii jaanch samiti kii report abhi mantralay ko nahin mili he or samiti is par bhi vichaar karegi
 The committee will consist of five senior women officers of the Sports Ministry and one female member of the NGO
 samiti ek sadsy dilli mahila ayog se chunegi
 Meanwhile, Kaushik questioned Hockey India's right to recommend police and government action against him
 unhone aapatti jataai ki haaki india ne aaropon kaa satyaapan kiye bina hi maan liya ki ranjita devi kii unke khilaaf shikaayat ‘vishwasaneey’ he
 He said that the report of the five-member inquiry committee had only facts and no recommendation had been made so Hockey India cannot recommend action against them
 kowshik ne jaldbaaji main bulaaye gayi samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, ‘main haaki india ke meri sevaaon kaa istemaal nahin karne or dilli police ko mere khilaaf karrwai karne kii sifarish karne kaa faisle par aapatti jataata hum
 If the inquiry committee had not made any recommendation then how could Hockey India do this? ’ unhone poocha, ‘main haaki india ke mahasachiv narinder batra ke is bayaan par aapatti jataata hum ki ranjita devi kaa likhit jawaab vishwasaneey tha or isamen vishisht aarope lagaaye gayi the
 The report stated that there was no verification of the allegations
 isliye yah virodhabhasi he, ek taraf to aap kah rahe hai ki uskaa paksh vishwasaneey he or saath hi yah bhi ki ye sabit nahin hua
 How is this possible? ’media ke saamne apane vakeelon mandira mitra or praveen agarwal ko pesh karte hue kowshik ne kaha, ‘main phir kah rahaa hum ki mere khilaaf lagaaye ye sabhi aarope aadharahin or managasaint hai
 i have responded to the letter sent by Hockey India to the Sports Ministry recommending action against me
 ’mitra ne kaha ki unka muvakkil kuch samay sthiti ko dekhegaa or uske baad jarurat hui to adaalat jayega
 He said, 'it is too early to say whether he will go to court or not
 agar jarurat padi to ham adaalat jaaenge lekin pehle ham haaki india ke sarkaar ko bheje patr kaa jawaab de rahe hai
 We have given this answer to Vidya Stokes, the interim president of Hockey India
 ’ On the pretext of Rashtrakavi Ramdhari Singh Dinkar, PM Narendra Modi has simultaneously targeted Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar
 modi ne dinakar kii baton ko doharaate hue kaha ki agar bihar jatvaad se nahin ubra, to gal jayega
 Laloo Prasad did not take any time to respond to PM Modi's remarks
 unhone modi par palatwaar karte hue kaha ki ve khud hi jati sammelan bulaate hai
 In view of the Bihar elections, it is believed that Narendra Modi tried to surround lalu-nitish on the pretext of casteism only after keeping the Bihar elections in mind
 bihar main isi saal sitambar-oktober main vidhansabha chunaav hone vaala he
 Enthusiasts are still fast on elections
 modi ne shuukravaar ko ramdhaari singh 'dinakar' kaa zikr kar bihar sahit puure purvi bharat ke vikaas kii baat kahi or bihar se jati aadhaarit raajnneeti khatm karne kaa aahvaan kiya
 In the golden jubilee celebrations of Dinkar's magnum opus 'four Chapters of Culture' and 'waiting for Parashurama', Modi gave the example of Dinkar to end caste-based politics and work towards the development of the eastern part of the country
 unhone kaha ki desh kii pragati ke liye aavashyak he ki bihar sahit puure purvi bharat kaa vikaas ho or ve desh ke pashchimi hisse ke samaan ban saken
 In the year 1961, the Prime Minister remembered the letter written by Dinkar, in which the poet has emphasized that his home state of Bihar should rise above caste-based division and work towards building a meritorious society
 needed
 dinakar ke patr ko uddhrut karte hue modi ne kaha, 'aap kisi ek yaa do rajyon kii sahaayta se sarkaar nahin chalaa sakate
 If you do not rise above caste, Bihar's social development will be affected
 ' unhone kaha ki jahaan pashchimi bharat ke paas samruddhi he, vahiin purvi bharat ke paas gyaan he
 Both sectors can contribute equally to the development of the country
 mahaan kavi kii kritiyon ko yaad kiyapradhanmantri ne rashtrakavi dinakar ko mahaan duuradrashtaa bataaya or kaha ki dinakar kii kavitaaon main bhartiya samskruti evam dharoharon kaa bakhaan he, jinke jariye bharat kii aatma ko behatar tareeke se janaa va samajha ja saktaa he
 Modi said that Dinkar's literary works have been inspiring people of every generation in India
 unhone kaha, 'kuch hi rachanaaen hai, jo samay ke saath bhi usee tarah praasangik bani rahati hai, jis tarah dinakar kii rachanaaen hai
 'ramdhari Singh' Dinkar 'was born on 23 September 1908 in Simaria in Begusarai district, Bihar
 varsh 1974 main 24 april ko unka dehanth ho gaya
 'kurukshetra', 'rashmirathi', 'urvashi', 'renuka', 'hunkar' 'hare Ko Harinam' and 'CP and Shankha' are his classics

 According to the Khufia Agency, such terrorist organizations are constantly plotting attacks in India

 The director of the American intelligence agency, Dan Coats, said that Pakistan's sheltering of such a terrorist organization is a big blow to America's anti-terror efforts

 ) loksabhaa chunaav ke baad rahul gandhi ne congress adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya tha
 The Congress has not been able to find Rahul's option even after nearly two months
 ise lekar congress party main asamanjas jari he
 At the same time, Priyanka Gandhi is constantly active
 yahi vajah he ki congress ke varisht netaaon ne priyanka gandhi ko adhyaksh banane kii maang kii to priyanka ne khud bhi ek twit karke apane raajnneeti main hone kii baat kahi
 In such a situation, there has been some murmurings in the Congress, whose indications are that perhaps the command of the party can now be handed over to Priyanka
 congress ke varisht netaa priyanka ko adhyaksh banane main juteraahul gandhi kii jagah congress ke nae adhyaksh ke liye ashok gahalot se lekar susheel kumaar scindia, mallikarjun khadge, mukul vaasanic jaise kai naamon ke kayaas chal chuke hai, lekin nateeja nahin nikaala
 Amid such delays, some Congress leaders have demanded Priyanka Gandhi to be the party president
 iske liye netaaon ne party ke bheetar or baahar bhoomika taiyaar kerani shuru kar di he
 These senior Congress leaders feel that there is no better option than Priyanka to replace Rahul in the Congress
 haalanki rahul gandhi khud ye saaf kar chuke hai ki party kaa aglaa adhyaksh gandhi parivaar se nahin hoga
 Despite this, this demand is arising because Congress leaders and workers have high hopes for Priyanka Gandhi's leadership
 haar ke baad priyanka ne nahin choda padloksabhaa chunaav kii haar kii jimmedaari lete hue congress adhyaksh pad se rahul gandhi ne istipha de diya tha
 After this, many state presidents of Congress and many leaders have resigned from their posts
 itnaa hi nahin priyanka gandhi ke saath banaae gaye mahasachiv or pashchim upi ke prabharee rahe jyotiraditya sindhiya ne bhi apane pad se istipha de diya
 But Priyanka did not leave her post
 jabaki priyanka ke prabhaar vaale purvi uttar pradesh main congress ko mahaj ek seat mili thi, baaki siton par party netaaon kii jamaanat jabt ho gai thi
 Even after the crushing defeat of the Congress, Priyanka still remains in her post
 priyanka lagaataar sakriyaloksabhaa ke chunaav nattejey aane ke baad congress ke netaa puri tarah se niskriy he
 While Priyanka Gandhi is constantly active
 upi kii haar ke liye lagaataar party netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ke saath manthan kar rahi hai
 Apart from this, she is also looking for the defiant leaders of the party
 vahiin, pichley kuch dinon se priyanka uttar pradesh kii yogi sarkaar par jamkar hamale bhi kar rahi hai
 This is seen as a by-election to 12 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh as well as preparing for the assembly elections to be held in 2022
 raajnneeti main entry par twitpriyanka gandhi ne nelson mandela kii jayanti ke maukey par ek puraani tasviir share karte hue apni raajnneetik entry kii baat kahi he
 Priyanka has tweeted and said, 'mandela said that i should be in politics
 duniya ko nelson mandela jaise vyaktiyon kii kami aaj pehle se zyada mahasoos hoti he
 His life is an example of truth, love and freedom
 ' iske jariye priyanka saaf taur par kahana chaahati hai ki unki raajnneetik kshamta nelson mandela 2001 main pahchaan gaye the
 Through this, she wants to give a big political message
 kya betaa bhi chahta he ki priyanka bane congress adhyaksh?priyanka gandhi ke bete rehaan wadra bhi kya congress adhyaksh ke taur par apni maa ko dekhnaa chaahate hai
 This question is arising that Rehan Vadra has shared a news story on his Facebook account, in which senior Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi has been asked to make party president
 jabaki isse pehle ab tak rehaan ne aisi koi khabar share nahin kiya tha
 This is the reason why there are speculations about Priyanka Gandhi becoming president in the political corridors

 aam aadmi party se alag hue prashanth bhushan ab dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke khilaaf khulkar saamne aa gaye hai
 Bhushan held a press conference on Saturday morning and called Kejriwal's Janlokpal Bill as Mahajokpal
 isse pehle shuukravaar shaam ko bhi twit kar janalokapal ko un siddhanton ko todane vaala bataaya tha jo un sabhi ne milakar tay kiye the
 According to Prashant Bhushan, the Delhi government is going to present its Lokpal bill in the House on Monday
 Delhi Lokpal bill trashes all principles of an Ind Janlokpal that we had drafted: Appt & removal not under govt; Ind Inv agency under Lokpal— Prashant Bhushan (@pbhushan1)november 27, 2015prashanth ke kejariwal par 8 hamale1
 Anna's movement was for an independent Lokpal
 lokapal sarkaar se swatantra hona chahie
 You came out of the movement that had to bring an independent Lokpal, but Kejriwal's Delhi Jan Lokpal bill does not have that soul
 kejariwal kaa bill, mahajokapaal he
 2
 is sarkaar ko aate hi janalokapal laana chahie tha
 But after nine and a half months it was billed
 vah bhi mahajokapaal he
 We also got a copy of it with great difficulty
 is bill ko is tarah gupt kyon rakhaa gaya
 Kejriwal should resign now
 3
 a drafting committee was then formed
 usamen ham 5 log the, santosh hegade, kejariwal, anna or ham donon
 It said that people connected with politics will not have the right to remove Lokpal
 lekin sab sarkaar or netaaon ke haath main de diya gaya
 4
 lokapal hataane ke liye supreme court kii kamity kii sifarish honi chahie
 It was also in the Lokpal of Uttarakhand that the government would have only one man
 lekin is lokapal main niyukti se lekar us par niyantran or use hataane tak sab sarkaar ke haath main he
 5
 2014 main jab aam aadmi party kii sarkaar bani to istipha is aadhaar par hua ki janalokapal pesh nahin hua
 Only Kejriwal knew his basis
 kebinet main lokapal paas ho gaya phir hamane chitthee likhakar lokapal maanga or ise privet karne kii baat kahi
 6
 ab lokapal aisa banaaya ki vah sarkaar ke kabje main rahegaa
 Three out of four would be government people
 is bill main lokapal ko do tihaai bahumat se hataane kaa adhikaar de diya gaya he
 7
 is bill main ye le aaye ki dilli kaa lokapal centre ke adhikari kii jaanch karegaa
 This provision was kept so that the Center does not pass it
 yah dobaaraa atak jayega
 Kejriwal did not intend to have an independent Lokpal
 8
 Kejriwal's attitude has now changed
 ek baar satta main aa gaye tab ham javabdehi nahin hone denge vaala ravaiya he
 This is a deception of that movement and the people

 Madhavan, Deepak Dobriyal and Swara bhaskardirector: Anand L
 Rai a Kangana was seen in 2011 but this time there are two
 chulabuli
 Cool
 harfanmaulaa
 Gimmick khilaadi
 Frank kisi ko bhi fansaane main maahir
 a girl who managed to win hearts and live on her own terms
 yani majaa doguna he
 It does not take a second to see the film 'sanu Weds Manu Returns' saying that the film is on the shoulders of Kangana
 phir dokanganake aane se dhyaan kahani se kaaphi had tak bant jaataa he
 Perhaps Anand L
 Rai understood this very well
 isliye unhone kahani ko kaaphi kuch pichhali baar jaisaa hi rakhaa he, sirf kusum sangwan naam kaa nayaa kairactor daal diya he
 Many things come to light, such as the re-emergence of Jimmy Shergill and Madhavan's fortunes
 tanu kaa rickshaw vaale se flert
 The same old style of tanu
 adhed shaadishuda aadmi kaa college kihariyanvikanya se gudi-gudi vaala prem or ek benatija prem kahani
 There is much more, but it is Kusum and Tanu who push the film well with their swagger
 kul milakar yah prem ke baad shaadi or shaadi ke baad prem ke bhoot utarane kii kahani he
 Which is decorated with smooth dialogues and good music
 kahani main kitna damakahani kii shuruyaat madhavan or kangana (tanu) kii shaadi se hoti he
 Both then move to London
 bidans tanu or sidhe manu ke bich man-mutaav badhane lagata he
 The two go to the psychiatrist and Manu is put into a mental asylum due to anger
 phir kangana waapas laut aati he
 Manu also comes to India, so here he meets Kusum Sangwan who looks like Tanu
 puraane prem kii pidaa jaag jaati he
 On the other hand, Tanu starts living her flirt life again, then she realizes that Manu's affair is going on, then the story turns
 anand jis kaam main safal ho sake hai, vah kusum ke jariye samay baandhne main kyonki kahani everej he
 Kusum falls heavily on Tanu and she takes the average story with her acting to high levels
 editing kasaavat bhari he
 North India and especially the Haryanvi style make the film special
 kangana jis tarah kii acting karti hai, vah bollywood ke kai sitaron ke liye misaal he
 Kangana also gives wings to the story with her average style
 aisa lagata he ki kusum or tanu do alag-alag insaan hai
 This is another memorable role of Kangana after Queen
 madhavanthik-thaak hai
 But they should control their weight a bit
 ve apni musakaraahat or khamoshi se kaaphi kuch kah jate hai
 Jimmy Shergill and Swara Bhaskar are also the same
 deepak dobariyaal gudgudate hai
 There is no doubt that there is a good craze for the film, and Kangana gives a lot of opportunities when the seats are ringing and there is a lot of noise in the hall
 film dekhte hue man kisi ko talashta he to vah kusum sangwan hi he
 Wins the heart
 gaharaai tak utar jaati he or vah bataa detii he ki uske jaisaa koi nahin
 The music of the film is good
 shaadi kaa maahaul bhi he
 There is also a North Indian Connect
 phir iskaa bajet lagbhag 50 karod ru
 Is told
 film ghate kaa sauda katai nahin rahane vaali he kyonki kangana ise box offis par kaaphi aage tak le jane kii kuwvat rakhti hai

 lekin aisa kissa aapane shaayad hi suna hoga ki ek purv mantri ne aisi chaal chali ki apana bangala to nahin hi khaali kiya, ek cabinet mantri ko usee kaa bangala khaali kara diya
 Now the minister is without a government house and is trying hard to get a bungalow
 ek nahin, do purv mantri aise hai, jinase bangala khaali karaane main sarkaar ko paseene aa gaye hai
 This magnificent bungalow on Delhi's Akbar Road has been a minister in the UPA government for the past several years and Ambika Sonirah, a senior Congress leader
 ambika soni philhal rajyasabha kii saansad hai
 On 9 November, when Chaudhary Virendra Singh, who left the Congress and joined the BJP, became a cabinet minister, he was allotted a Type 8 bungalow
 virendra singh tab tak 84 lodhi estate ke chote tip 6 ke bangale main rah rahe the, jo unhen saansad ke taur par pehle se mila hua tha
 Chaudhary Virendra Singh was allotted a bungalow at 22 Akbar Road in January, but how would he go there because Ambika Soni was still there
 ambika soni ne pehle to yah ghar khaali karne se saaf manaa kar diya
 She argued that as a Rajya Sabha MP she deserves this bungalow
 jab unhen bangala khaali karne kaa notice diya gaya to ve court main chali gayi
 Along with her, former minister Kumari Selja also went to court, who was not ready to vacate her minister's bungalow
 maamla jab hoicourt main pahunchaa to court ne ambika soni or kumari shailaja, donon ko joardaar fatkaar lagaai
 Not only this, a fine of Rs 25,000 was also imposed on both of them
 lekin ambika soni or kumari shailaja ne haar nahin maani or is faisle ke khilaaf hoicourt kii dabl bench main apil kar di
 Ambika Soni now told the court that they are ready to vacate the bungalow at 22 Akbar Road, but they should be given a home
 ambika soni ke liye ab ek adad tip 7 ke bangale kii khoj shuru hui
 The search ended at the bungalow of 84 Lodhi Estate, in which Chaudhary Virendra Singh was staying
 lekin court main ambika soni ke vakil kapil sibbal ne yah daleel di ki jab tak ye ghar khaali nahin kiya jaataa, ve bhala kaise dekh paaengi ki ye ghar unke rahane ke kaabil he bhi yaa nahin
 In the hope of getting the number 22 Akbar Road, Chaudhary Virendra Singh vacated the house in a hurry
 virendra singh pichley chaar saal se is ghar main rah rahe the or mantri banane ke baad bhi isamen hi the
 But Ambika Soni told the court that this house is not fit to live
 philhal choudhary veerandra singh bina sarkari ghar ke hai, kyonki akbar road kaa bangala abhi khaali nahin hua he or lodhi estate ke bangale ko nae sire se marammat karke ambika soni ke rahane ke laayak banaaya ja rahaa he
 On September 7, the High Court double bench has also said in its decision that Ambika Soni and Kumari Selja vacate the minister's bungalow within a month
 lekin gramin vikaas mantri choudhary virendra singh ko dar he ki pataa nahin, akbar road kaa shandaar bangala unhen maheene bhar baad bhi milegaa yaa nahin

 Last month, the Indian smartphone company OKWU launched the second smartphone Omicron
 company ne isse pehle OKWU Pi ko bazaar main launch kiya tha
 We kept Omicron with us and after using it for a month, we are sharing its review with you
 dizinmauktu Omicron kii body metal kii bani he lekin back cover plastic kaa he
 Due to the fully metal frame, the smartphone looks great but it weighs a bit
 halke smartphone upyog karne ke aadi logon ko ye thodi mushkil de sakati he
 However, its design seems a bit pale compared to the smartphones around this range
 smartphone baari hone ke saath thodaa motaa bhi he, yani slik dizin kii chahat aapaki is smartphone main puri nahin hoti
 5 in the display
 5 inch 1920x1080 pixles phul HD IPS disple diya gaya he
 The screen is good in terms of normal use and touch also works very smooth
 chunkidisple hdhe isliye color or picksal smartphone main behatar hai
 Camera: Now come to the point of work, what is its camera like? Its rear has a 13-megapixel camera with PDAF, while its front has a 5-megapixel camera
 donon kii camro main graahakon ko LED flash bhi milegaa
 That is, the smartphone is better in terms of selfie because you will get good pictures even in low-light condition
 jahaan tak rier camere kaa sawaal he isse bhi tasviren acchhee aati hai lekin lo-lite main camera kuch khaas nahin kar paata
 The pictures we took during the day were really amazing
 sabase acchhee baat ye thi ki isamen focus ko lekar kisi tarah ki dikkat kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa

 Apart from this, running U-tube live from the speaker also caused some trouble
 kuch aam tarah ke eps bhi aapako smartphone main najar nahin aaenge jaise youtube bhi hamen downlod karnaa padaa tha
 Fingerprint scanner felt the need to talk about it separately because the company claimed that the fingerprint scanner of this smartphone is the fastest among all smartphones in the world

 That is, after full charge once, if you continuously run internet in 4G or start playing games, then it can cheat you anytime
 iske alaava isaki body bahut jald hi garm ho jaati he
 Finally, i want to say that this smartphone will get a lot of competition from the rest of the smartphones available in this range

 The game of cricket in India is nothing less than a passion

 But has anyone ever done so that the team has won, and happily took off their precious jewelery and threw it towards the players? Why this duplication? If passion is to be shown then why do not it appear in both the situations? Maintaining the dignity of cricket is now a challenge for us
 Hindustan is a country of civilized people and a game of cricket gentlemen

 However, 60-year-old Kutappa, who was killed in the violence incident, was cremated
 kisaan aatmahatya mahaj aankada nahin hai
 This is the culmination of the lives of farmers going through a tragic time
 maharashtra ke vidarbha ilaake main kisaanon ke bich lambey samay se kaam karne ke dauraan maine is bhayanak badlaav ko jiya he
 Today, Vidarbha, which is being ruined by the collapse of the cash crop of cotton or falling prices, was once different
 teen dashak pehle tak yahaan paaramparik kheti hoti thi or fasalon ke bich behatar santulan tha
 But then the government brought the policy of cash crops
 kisaanon ko in fasalon kii ore sarkaar ne hi jhukaaya
 But since the subsidy on cash crops ended in 1997, farmers have been completely at the mercy of the market
 itane lambey samay tak kapaas kii kheti karne ke dauraan bhoojal kaa jabardast dohan hone diya gaya
 Now there is no water inside the ground and rain does not get irrigated even when the monsoon is bad
 ye chijen kisaan ko sankat main khadaa kar detii hai
 But the crisis is further aggravated when the farmer buys the seeds at a very high price and then the crop gets spoiled
 haldi kaa beej 20,000 ru
 Kg is being sold and the price per kilogram of certain varieties of papaya is Rs
 se upar nikal jaati he
 The farmer takes a loan to buy these seeds
 maharashtra kii sthiti yah he ki 20 fisadi kisaanon ne agar bainkon se karj liya he to 80 fisadi kisaanon ne sahukaaron se karj liya he
 The moneylender here does not mean a man wearing a traditional turban and with glasses stuck on his nose
 samay ke hisaab se rishtedaar, sarkari karmchaaree, adhyaaapak or pulisavaale sab is dhandhe main utar aae hai
 It has become a parallel rural economy of Maharashtra
 yahi vajah he ki agar sarkarein karj maaf bhi karti hai to usase kisaanon ke bade varg ko phayda nahin mil paata
 The second problem is that the police and administration do not consider 90 percent of farmer suicides to be farmer suicides, in which case, after the farmer commits suicide, his family comes to the road completely or comes to the mercy of relatives
 jahaan tak maharashtra sarkaar kii ore se die gaye package kaa sawaal he to isse kuch hone vaala nahin he
 Earlier, in 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009 too, huge packages were given in the name of farmers, but these have increased rather than stopping farmer suicides
 kyonki in packejon kaa mul uddeshy kisaanon kaa dukh dur karne kii bajaae kuch logon ko apni jeben bharne kaa mauka dena tha
 The government should forgive the debt of farmers directly
 iske baad gaanv main fasalon kaa paaramparik tarika behaal karne kii taraf dhyaan diya jaae
 In any case, more than 50 percent of the farmers should not go towards cash crops and the remaining farmers should turn to pulses and oilseeds
 kisaanon ko behatar swasthya sevaayen muhaiyaa karai jaaen
 Better means of education should be provided to their children
 khaad or beej ke daam is tarah niyantrit kiye jaaen ki kisaanon kii laagat bahut zyada na badaae paae
 If all these things are implemented in a systematic manner, there will be gradual but basic improvement in the condition of the farmers
 shiksha or swasthya kaa kheti se sidhaa sambandh bhale na ho lekin swasthya par hone vaale kharch kaa kisaan aatmahatya se bahut bada sambandh he
 Initiatives like food security should be implemented
 isse kam se kam sookhe yaa anya vikat halaat main kisaan ke saamne bhukhon marane kii naubat to nahin aegi
 But it is seen that instead of making such positive reforms, the government goes on anti-farmer policies in the name of reform
 kisaan aatmahatya rokane ke liye buniyadi upaay jaruri hai
 This cannot be overcome by too much emotionalism or speech
 (lekhak vidarbha janandolan samiti se jude hai
 This article is based on a conversation with Piyush Babelle
 ) There are moments in every boy's life when he gets true love with a girl
 use lagata he ki usee ladki ke saath vah jindagi bitaana chahta he
 Sometimes boys fall in love with their close friends
 kyonki vah dost hoti he isliye usase dil kii baat kehane main ladke ghabaraate hai
 i am afraid that friendship will not break
 kisi ladki ko bhi agar apane dost se pyaar ho jaae to man main yahi ashanka rahati he
 Know those things that you can understand by noticing whether a friend loves you or not
 
 
 1- agar vah apane puraane boylerends ke bare main bejhijak baat karti he
 If you discus your love life, then you should understand that you are nothing more than a friend to her
 2- agar aapaki dost aapako kisi or ladki ke bare main bataati he yaa milwati he yaa phir kahati he ki falaan ladki ke bare main socho to matlab saaf he
 She cares for you but does not love
 ye 7 aadaten hai to aap sabit honge 'bure' pati!3- body language se bhi bahut kuch saaf ho jaataa he
 There is a way to hold your hands or to pat you on the back
 agar vah aapse ek jaruri duuri banaakar rakhti he to aapako use prapoj karne se pehle sochna chahie
 4- If you call her for coffee and she brings her friends with her then boss these are not good signs for you
 5- agar vah aapkaa naam pyaar se lene ke bajaay sarnem se pukaarti he yaa phir bro or bady jaise shabdon kaa istemaal karti he to aapako dil dene se pehle sochna chahie
 Do these important things with your life partner before getting married
 6 - If she does not like to take any help from you, for example, she likes to meet somewhere on the way instead of picking herself up from home
 yaa phir bill hameshaa 50-50 karne kii koshish karti he to aapako samaj janaa chahie ki aap uske liye sirf dost hai

 congress pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne buudhvaar ko ek audio jari kiya
 (rafale Audio Leak) Randeep Surjewala claimed that a few days ago at the Goa Cabinet meeting, Manohar Parrikar made a big statement related to the Rafale files
 manohar parrikar ne kaha tha ki koi unka kuch nahin kar saktaa, sari filein unke paas hai
 Congress leader Surjewala has released audio of a talk by Goa Health Minister Vishwajit Rane
 surajevaala ne sawaal daaga ki aakhir manohar parrikar ke paas rafel se judi koun-si filon kaa raaj dafn he
 After all, what is wrong with Rafael's files
 haalanki, surajevaala ne goa ke mantri kis vyakti se baat kar rahe hai iskaa khulaasa nahin kiya he
 The Congress leader said that in the entire matter related to National Security and Rafale Procurement Scam, the statement by the BJP Chief Minister and former Defense Minister confirms all the allegations of the Rafale Scam that there is a mess in Rafael at all levels

 Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar also tweeted
 unhone twit kar likhaa ki congress dwaara jari kiya gaya audio unke jhooth kaa pardaafash karata he
 There was no talk about this issue in the cabinet meeting
 The audio clip released by the congress party is a desperate attempt to fabricate facts after their lies were exposed by the recent Supreme Court verdict on Rafale

 Geeta - Welcome home our daughter
 Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, which had been keeping their high mountains green throughout the year, were burning in terrible ways due to these trees
 uttarakhand ke jangalon main lagi aag ne to beete varshon ke saare record dhwast kar daale
 As of May 4, 3,500 hectares of forest has been covered in Uttarakhand, which is more than in previous years
 visheshgyon ke mutabik, aag kii vajah chid kii pattiyaan hai, jo jvalansheel padaarth kaa kaam karti hai
 Director of the Forest Research Institute of Dehradun, Dr
 savita bataati hai, “april ke maheene main aamtaur par uttarakhand main teen-chaar baar barish ho jaati he or adhiktam taapmaana 35-36 degree celsius tak jaataa he
 But this time it did not rain and the temperature also increased suddenly
 aise main chid kii needles (isaki pattiyaan sooyee ke aakaar kii hoti hai) main gharshan bad gaya or yahi aag kii vajah ban gayi
 64 of the total area in Uttarakhand
 65 fisadi vanakshetra he, jisamen 22 fisadi saghan van hai
 The number of pine is the highest in the forests here
 rajya ke vanavaran kaa kshetrafal 34,000 varg kilometre he, jisamen chid hi kareeb 17,000 varg kilometre main hai
 In the remaining part there are trees of various species like Banj, Sal, Sheesham, Burans, Kafal
 chid himalay kii mukhya vriksh prajati he
 It has 105 species worldwide
 himalay main chid kaa mukhya centre uttarakhand ko mana jaataa he, jahaan chid kii do prajatiyaan cheer pine or blue pine milti hai
 Former Chancellor and Botanist of Garhwal University, Prof
 es
 P
 singh bataate hai, “chid kii pattiyon main lignin naam kaa rasayan hota he, jisaki vajah se ve atyadhik jvalansheel hoti hai or jaldi aag pakad leti hai
 This year more than 20 million tonnes of pine leaves were stored in the forests, which started to fizzle with rising mercury due to low humidity and dry weather and the fire took a formidable form
 ” himachal pradesh main bhi is saal jangalon main aag lagane kii ab tak 573 ghatnaayen ho chuki hai, jisaki chapet main pradesh kaa 5,195 hectare jangal aa chukaa he
 This fire is due to people? savita bataati hai, “uttarakhand main myth he ki aag lagane ke baad jo ghaas ugti he, vah pashuon ke liye zyada paushtik hoti he
 Therefore, in many cases, it is seen that only the local people set fire to the forest
 isi tarah jammu ke simavarti jile rajouri ke gambhir muglah or bathoni gaavon main 5 hectare jameen par lagi aag ke peeche kisi timber mafia ko nahin balki sthaneey logon ko hi jimmedaar mana ja rahaa he
 Chaudhary Lal Singh, forest minister of Jammu and Kashmir, says, "in fact, people who go to the forest to graze animals in summer, in most cases they have their hand behind the fire
 ” haalanki ve yah bhi kehete hai ki abhi tak koi saboot nahin mila he ki ham aise logon par maamla darj kar saken
 Actually, the new grass does not grow until the leaves of the pine tree fall in the forests, until these leaves are removed
 nai ghaas ug sake, isliye log patton ko aag laga dete he
 According to the forest minister, the second reason for the fire is the throwing of beedi-cigarettes in the dry season of april-june by cattle grazing people in the forest
 kabhi-kabhi is mausam main chid kii pattiyaan apane-aap aag pakad leti hai
 Says Lal Singh, "to prevent such incidents, the government will have to fence in the forest and it will cost around Rs 8,000 crore
 kharch baithegaa
 According to an estimate, every year in Uttarakhand, 51 lakh tonnes of pine leaves, also known as pirul, fall from the trees and spread in the forests
 inkaa jangal se uthaav nahin hota or ye vighatit hone main bhi vakt leti hai
 For the last four years, this Pirul remained stored in the forests
 is baar kam barish, na ke baraabar nami or chadhate paare se isane barood kaa rup le liya, jiskaa parinaam bhayaavah aag ke rup main saamne he
 Due to the highly flammable and acidic tendency of the pine, fires occur every year
 adhyayanon ke mutabik, uttarakhand kaa ausatan 1,000 hectare jangal chid kii sukhi pattiyon kii vajah se har saal aag kii chapet main aata he
 Statistics of the Forest Survey of India also confirm this
 lekin yah aag jamini str par hi bujh jaati he or iske vrikshon kii chotii tak pahunchane ke bahut kam hi maamle saamne aate hai lekin is baar aag vrikshon kii chotii tak pahunch gai, jo chintaa kii baat he
 Pollution levels have also increased due to large-scale fires in the forests
 himachal pradesh main pradooshan niyantran board ke varisht vaigyanik dow
 Manoj Chauhan says, "in May, forests often catch fire
 isliye april kii tulana main is maheene main pradooshan kaa str bad jaataa he
 "however, in April this year, pollution levels have increased
 himachal pradesh pradooshan niyantran board ke sadsy sachiv vineet kumaar bataate hai, “wanon main aag kii vajah se vaayu pradooshan kaa str kitna badha he iskaa to koi vivaran uplabdh nahin hota par espm maapne ke liye bane hamaare kendron ke paas jo data he, usase yahi pataa chalata he ki april maah ke ant or may maah kii shuruyaat main vaayu main suspended particulet kii maatra saamaanya se adhik he
 If we look at the SPM scale of the Pollution Control Board, only the capital Shimla, then this year it will be 40
 6 par pahunch gaya he, jabaki april main ausatan yah 36 ke aasapaas rahata tha
 The most affected districts are Shimla, Sirmaur and Solan
 jaahir he ki wanon main aag rajya kii hawa ko pradooshit kar rahi he
 Fire extinguishes According to Professor Jeet Ram, Head of the Department of Forestry Department at Revenuekumoun University, the pine is the hardest species in the Himalayas and it grows with fire
 chid ke wanon se har saal prati hectare ausatan teen ton pattiyaan jhadati hai
 To avoid fire, regular lifting of their leaves is necessary
 jeet ram ke mutabik, iskaa ekmaatr upaay in pattiyon kaa vanijyik istemaal hi ho saktaa he
 In this regard, mous were also signed with private entrepreneurs, but they were not implemented
 haalanki pithauragarh jile main is kism kii ek koshish jari he
 a power plant of 9 KW has been installed here to make electricity from this Pirul and at present it is sending lights to 200 houses
 avani baio energy naamak company ne 2009 main isaki shuruyaat kii thi
 The company is now planning to set up another 120 KW power plant at a place called Chachert
 is company se jude rajnish jain bataate hai, “chid kii pattiyon ko katkar inhen ek gasifaire main niyantrit oxigen kii aapurti kar jalaayaa jaataa he, jisase carbon mono oxide, methane or hydrogen kaa mishran miltaa he
 Power is obtained by cleaning it and filling it in a generator
 ” 1997-98 main in pattiyon ke jariye eendhan main prayukt bricks banane kaa emoyu bhi van vibhaag or kuch udhyamiyon ke bich hua tha par jangal se pirul uthaane kaa kharchaa zyada hone se yah yojana paravaan nahin chadh saki
 In any case, it remains alive and is very helpful in regeneration of pine forests
 aisa isliye kyonki yah prajati aise kshetron main bhi rah sakati he, jahaan mitti main poshak tatv na ke baraabar hon
 Pine also has fire resistance

 That's where Prof

 P
 singh chid ko aag ke liye jimmedaar tehraana uchit nahin maanate
 He says, "the fire in Uttarakhand naturally does not come from the sparks of stones, nor from the rubbing of trees , as is being attempted
" vajah maanavajanit he
 It is possible that the fire may have been set up during the control burning of the forest department, which may have spread later or the villagers have given the impression that in the rainy season, the grass can grow quickly and new grass will be found soon
 ”aag lagane kii ghatana main van taskaron ke shaamil hone kii baat par dow
 Ajay Rawat says, "if the forest smugglers were caught on fire, it has become easier today to catch them while trying to raise big trees
 so van taskar jangal main is aag kii vajah nahin ho sakate
 Yes, it may be that wildlife smugglers smuggle wildlife by setting fire
 ” dow
 Rawat has been the Head of the Department of History at Kumaon University
 vanyajeevon or vanaspatiyon ko khatrajangalon main aag lagane se sabase zyada khatra yahaan ke vanyajeevon ko he
 Apart from this, the flora here is also under threat
 kumaun vishvavidhyalay ke vanaspativigyaan vibhaag ke professor lalit tiwari kehete hai, “aag kii vajah se kai vanaspatiyaan samaapt hone kii kagaar par pahunch sakati hai
 While fires in the region have threatened forests like Banj, more than 9,000 botanical species of the region have also been threatened, including Kilmora, Hisalu, Kafal and other wildflowers
 ”pro
 According to Tiwari, a large number of wild bear, kankar, reindeer including deer, and species of birds like Monal and Cheer Phageant have been killed
 aag se bachane ko jhaadipoon main chhipe baithe bade jantu jaise sher or baagh bhi aag kii bhent chadh gaye hon to aashcharya kii baat nahin
 According to him, this fire has also threatened species of Reptiles
 iske alaava titliyon kii tamaam naslein bhi isse swaha ho gayi
 This fire has also hit natural sources
 vaigyanikon kaa anumaan he ki isse uthi dhundh or vayumandal main paidaa hui carbon dioxide yahaan ke glaciaron ke liye nuksandaayak he
 The danger is that when carbon particles fall to the ground with rain and stick to the glaciers, their melting rate will increase and this can lead to many natural disasters

 Doval explains, "the fog that rises from the fire can prove to be dangerous for all the gullers here
 ”may maah kii shuruyaat main himachal or uttarakhand main hui barish chid or banj ke jal rahe jangalon ke liye raahat kii khabar lekar ai
 One day of rain has given some relief, but the NGT has issued a notice to the state government asking what it did to control the forest fire
 There is hardly any concrete answer for the government because it was not ready for such a disaster
 beete chaar saal main himachal ke wanon main lagi aag se kareeb aath karod ru
 The property has been destroyed jangal kii aag shaharon yaa rihaishi ilaakon tak nahin pahunchi he par teenon hi rajyon main is aag ne paryaton ko khaasaa prabhavit kiya he
 However, the officials of these states do not accept the impact of tourism
 lekin shimla ke hotel association ke sadsy nitin sharma kehete hai, “aag kii vajah se failaa dhuna sailaaniyon ko bhi shimla se vimukh kar rahaa he
 Whatever the claims, this time the magnitude of the fire in the forests is worrisome

 com / xyvzqv1ug8 — Virender Sehwag (@virendersehwag) April 1, 2017 marathi film nirmaataa atul tapakirake aatmahatya karne kii baat saamne ai he jisase puri marathi film industry sadame main he
 Let me tell you that Atul Tapakir has been the producer of Marathi film 'dholatashe' and has been a known face of Marathi film industry
 atul ne mumbai se sate pune ke ek hotel main aatmahatya kii
 The hotel in which Atul committed suicide is being named as The President Hotel where Atul first wrote his entire story on Facebook and then took poison after consuming it
 apane suicide note main atul ne saaf likhaa kii kis tarah se wo apni jindagi mempareshaan or unki pareshaani kii vajah kahi na kahin unki patni priyanka he
 Atul wrote in his suicide note that Priyanka not only used to give him mental harassment but also kept him away from his children
 priyanka atul ke parivaaravaalon ke saath bhi gaali galouj karti thi
 Also, Atul was also expelled from the house by Priyanka 6 months ago
 atul kii pareshaani naa sirf unki patni priyanka thi balki atul par kaaphi karj bhi tha jiskaa ullekh unhone apane suicide note main kiya
 Before dying, Atul made it clear that how much women take advantage of the law wrongly and men have to suffer atrocities
 atul ne jate jate sarkaar se apil kiya ki wo purushon kii bhi sune
 At present, the Pune police is investigating the entire case
 dilli vikaas praadhikaran is saal logon ke liye kareeb 25,000 flats lekar ai he
 There are plans to provide homes to people from posh areas like South Delhi to Narela and Rohini, but are these new flats a profitable deal for the people
 shaayad kuch ilaakon main aisa nahin
 The Narela area of outer Delhi, about 50 km from South Delhi, still seems far away from the pace of development
 yahaan didie kareeb 1 xxrep 4 0 nae flats taiyaar kar rahaa he, lekin yahaan ke halaat aise hai ki niveshkon ko zyada faaydaa hota nahin dikhataa
 DDA has old flats near the new flat
 narela ke sector 10 main kareeb 1800 van bedroom flats hai
 Flats are being allotted here since 1993
 phir bhi kareeb 40 pratishat flats khaali pade hai
 Neither are they getting fair price nor are the buyers
 yahaan ke praparty dealer eyes khatri ke mutabik, yah ilaaka vikaas se koson dur he
 There is no metro connectivity
 sadaken jarjar haalat main hai
 There are no shopping complexes
 bacchon ke liye achche skool nahin hai
 There is no college and hospital
 or sabase badi baat ilaake main suraksha ke bhi pukhta intjaam nahin he
 In such a situation, the price of the property has become stable
 iske paas main hi he sector bi-2 he
 One-bedroom flats were allotted to people in 2006
 yahaan nivesh karne vaale logon ko laga ki ye flats unhen acha ritern denge, lekin yahaan aaj bhi sannata pasra he
 Out of a total of 2,420 flats, only 500 have been filled
 haalat ye hai ki ive flatus main transportron ne apane godaam bana rakhe hai
 This year the DDA will allocate more than 10,000 flats in Narela, of which the cost of LIG is 14 lakh to 29 lakh rupees
 jabaki pehle se bane flats isse kam yaa baraabar keemat par mil rahe hai
 The cost of MIG in the new scheme is Rs 42 to 70 lakh, while the builders are willing to give HIG size flats at such a price
 dakshini dilli main bhale hi elayeeji kaa kiraaya 8 se 15 hajaar ho, lekin yahaan ke bashindon ne bataaya ki unhen ek flats kaa kiraaya 2 se 3 hajaar tak hi miltaa he
 The old DDA flats of Rohini have a similar condition
 yahaan kii kachi or tuuti sadak ke raste ham rohinee sector 28 ke bagwan apartment pahunche
 The flats here look beautiful from a distance, but their maintenance is equally ugly
 mahaj saat saal puraane in flats kii deevaaron ke plaster tut−tut kar gir rahe hai
 Sewer and drainage pipes are uprooted
 andar kii sadaken bhi badahaal hai
 Thus, there are 2 booster pumps for water, but still there will not be drinking water
 siver ke pani ko nikaalane kii yahaan log water pump kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 Through the pump, sewer water is being filled in the ground in front of the apartment, that is, diseases are being invited directly
 didie ne yahaan 830 flats 2007 main aavantit kiye the, lekin badahaali ke chalate abhi bhi kareeb 300 flats khaali he, jinamein kuch is baar aavantit hone hai
 The condition of the flats lying vacant is like ruins, that is, if you get these flats, you will have to spend lakhs of rupees to repair them
 ye alag baat he ki log phir bhi nai skim par toote pade hai, kyonki unhen lag rahaa he ki ye privet bilderon ke muqaabale saste kaa sauda he or kai myanon main he bhi

 At such a time, if they have air-conditioned jackets, they will feel comfortable
 iske liye pareekshan jari he"
 Talking about Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas, Parrikar said that the only weak point of LCA Tejas was that it is a light aircraft and only 3
 5 ton bhaar le ja saktaa hai
 Parrikar, who was the defense minister between 2014 and 2017, returned to state politics earlier this year and has become the Chief Minister of Goa for the fourth time
 parrikar ne kaha ki "unhone elsie pariyojna par puri shiddat se kaam kiya hai"
 Parrikar, in response to a question about Indian capabilities for manufacturing world-class war equipment, said "this project was completed about five to six years ago" but due to some minor problems the government did not include it Was, i have held 18 consecutive meetings and got it included in the Air Force, now three aircraft have been included in the big aircraft
 Now the fleet has three aircraft and every one or two months Another new fighter aircraft is being inducted into the NE

 The break in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's travel abroad due to the assembly elections is going to end now
 is hafte pradhanmantri modi prastaavit srilanka yatra se khud par lagaae pratibandh ko khatm karne ja rahe hai
 PM Modi is ready to visit several countries one by one, starting from Sri Lanka
 videsh yatra ke is nae charan main jahaan pradhanmantri modi kii june main america yatra ke dauraan raashtrapati donald trump se mulaakaat sambhav he vahiin is dauraan france kaa daura kar vah nav niyukt raashtrapati emanuel macron se bhi mil sakate hai
 The most special among these is the preparations being made for the proposed visit to Israel during june-july
 is yatra kii taiyaari ke liye rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal israel kii yatra kar chuke hai or philhal videsh mantralay samet kendra sarkaar ke aadhe darjan mantralay is yatra ko safal banane kii taiyaari main jute hue hai
 Why is it important Israel travel? Israel is the holiest country on earth in terms of religion
 duniya ke teen dharmon kaa yahaan jerusalem se naata he
 However, according to politics, Israel is also considered the most dangerous region in the world
 vahiin bharat or israel kaa sambandh beete 25 saalon main majboot hua he lekin abhi tak desh kaa koi pradhanmantri israel kii yatra par nahin gaya he
 Therefore, Prime Minister Modi will be the first Prime Minister of the country to visit Israel after taking this visit
 israel or america: jeeopolitakal anglaisrael kii jeeyo politics ke chalate haal main hue america chunaav main jeet darj karne vaale donald trump ne prachaar ke dauraan ahm vaada kiya tha
 According to Trump's claim, after being elected president, he will replace the US embassy in the Israeli capital of Tel Aviv and establish it in the religious city of Jerusalem
 israel yatra kaa modi anglepradhanmantri modi bhi videsh yatra ke liye raajnneetik kendron ke bajaay dharmik or saanskrithik kendron ko ahmiyat dete hai
 This was seen for the first time during his visit to Japan when he reached Kyoto, the religious capital instead of the capital Tokyo
 vahiin china ke raashtrapati shi jinping kii bharat yatra ke dauraan unka kaarykram dilli se shuru hone ke bajaae gujarat main sabarmati ashram main kaarykram se shuru hui
 On the same lines, there is a possibility that Prime Minister Modi can start his Israel visit from the religious city of Jerusalem instead of the capital Tel Aviv
