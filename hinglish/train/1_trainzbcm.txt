 On the one hand, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has selected his favorite candidates in almost all the seats of the state and submitted a detailed list to the national president Mulayam Singh, on the other hand the party's state president has finalized 175 candidates and submitted his list to Mulayam
 bataane kii jarurat nahin he ki in donon soochiyon main apane-apane vishwast netaaon ko tikat dene kii sifarish kii gai he
 Now news has come that almost half of the leaders in this list of Akhilesh Yadav are ready to contest the elections as independents if they do not get tickets
 haalanki raajnneetik jaankaar ise akhilesh kii 'pressure tactice' zyada bataa rahe hai or isaki vajahen bhi hai
 - Those who understand political politics know that it is difficult, if not impossible, to win elections on their own without the support of any party
 agar ham upi kaa hi chunaav itihaas dekhen to zyaadaatar aise hi nirdaleey ummidavaar milenge jo yaa to apane baahubal kii vajah se jite hai yaa ilaake main unki lokapriyata bahut zyada thi lekin aise gine-chune maamle hi rahe hai
 -departmental candidates may not stand on a party ticket but they cause the most damage to the party with whom they have been associated
 kyonki kaaryakarta se lekar vot bank tak donon kaa samaan hota he
 In such a situation, the loss of independent candidates in the field will be the loss of Samajwadi Party, which will directly become Akhilesh's loss
 -agakhilesh yadampane samarthak netaaon ko nirdaleey ummivaar bana bhi dete hai to ve inke liye vot maangane kaise jaaenge? kya ve usee seat par samaajawaadee party kaa jhanda uthaae or cycle kaa chunaav chinh lekar lard rahe adhikrut pratyaashee ke khilaaf vot maangenge?-akhilesh party main aaj apane chachaa shivpal yadav ke khilaaf itani majbootee se agar khadey hai to isaki vajah he unki chhavi or sarkaar kaa kaamkaaj, lekin ve is baat ko nahin bhul sakate hai ki pradesh main doordaraj baitha voter unhen sapa ke mukhyamantri ke rup main hi jaanata he
 Such voters will vote for the SP to make Akhilesh the CM again and press the button in front of the cycle in EVM even if the candidate belongs to his uncle Shivpal's camp
 -thodi der ke liye maan bhi liya jaae ki akhilesh 200nirdaleey ummidavaarmaidan main utaarte hai or unamem se badi sankhya main chunaav jeet jate hai to kya guarantee he ki ve jeet ke baad bhi akhilesh ke saath barkaraar rahenge
 The political history of UP is replete with examples in which independents have to recover the full cost of their victory from the ruling party and have changed time to time
 bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) ne 2017-18 ke gharelu satr main dilip trophy ko jagah nahin di he
 India's domestic cricket season will begin with the Ranji Trophy from October 6

 adhikari ne kaha ki yah toornament gulabi gend se hi khelaa jayega
 But it would have been better if it had been held at the beginning of the session, not in the middle or at the end
 adhikari ne website ko bataaya, 'agar aapako yaad ho, to 2016 tii-20 vishwa cap se pehle bhi hamane dilip trophy kaa aayojan nahin kiya tha, kyonki jab ham tii-20 team kaa chayan karne vaale hon aise main is toornament kaa koi mahatv nahin hota he
 "he played 13 Test matches last year, so it was good to start with the Duleep Trophy
" yah toornament 24 dinon main khatm hota he
 We could not get it done in June or July due to the long sessions coming in and the grounds being busy, we had only the month of September left
 'adhikari ne kaha, 'is saal ham antarrashtriya siries se shuruyaat kar rahe hai, jo 17 sintabar se shuru hoga
 For this reason, teams will gather till 10-11
 isi kaaran hamane is satr main ise yojit na karne kaa faisla kiya or agle satr tak ke liye taal diya, jo test satr hi hoga jahaan bharat, westeindies, australia or newjiland ke saath khelegaa
 Then the Duleep Trophy will help us in our team selection

 bharat kii aazaadee ke mahanatam shilpakaaron main se ek subhash chandra bose par kuch research karne ke dauraan jab se maine yah janaa he ki ford motor company ne 1938 ke haripura satr ke dauraan congress ke mantriyon ke istemaal ke liye muft main apni nai ve-8 car di thi, tab se yah aadar puri tarah se vismay main badal gaya he
 Henry Ford, the founder of the American auto company, was famous for its assembly line; But it was a hallmark of his talent as an investment of goodwill
 unhone apni is pahal se bharat ke bhavishya main kaaphi pehle sahuuliyat sunishchit kara lee
 This excerpt is from a biography of Subhash Chandra Bose by Mihir Bose
 subhash chandra bose par leonard gordon kii bros against da raaj main ford ke is kalpanasheel pralobhan kii pushti ke liye khoj ke dauraan mujhe pataa chalaa ki bose ko vastav main congress ke shivi nagar main ek sthaneey sammanit vyakti dwaara daan kiye gaye rath par baitaakar le jaaya gaya tha jisamen '51 tagade bail' jute hue the
 In those days, the special vehicle of the Congress was the bullock cart of the farmers, it was also to be made the Congress symbol after 1952
 lekin is pratikwaad ko, tagade belon sahit, antim daur ke liye surakshit kar liya gaya
 Haripura was a small village on the banks of the Tapti River in Gujarat
 sardaar patel kii mejabani vaale is satr main shaamil hone ke liye bose haripura car se pahunche the
 Gordon does not mention whether this car was a Ford V-8
 bujurg henry ford yaa unke akjicutive 1938 main hi yah jaan gaye the, jiskaa andaja pratapi british raaj ko bhi nahin ho paaya tha, ki satta ek aadhaar se duusari ore ja rahi he or samrajya kaa yug samtawadi rashtrawaad ke aage samarpan karne vaala he
 Ford was investing in building relationships with congressional ministers
 varsh 1938 tak congress satta kaa swaad chakh chuki thi
 After the elections of 1937, the Congress came to power in more than half a dozen British provinces, but had to travel a long distance from dominating the municipal corporation of Lucknow to forming an independent government in Delhi
 jis kisi ne farvari, 1938 main haripura main yah mana hoga ki nau saal main bharat aaazaad ho jayega, vah dil se hi soch rahaa hoga, dimag se nahin
 The disastrous world war battered the British intentions; And this war against Hitler also took place after 18 months
 agar hitler puri tarah se narsanhaarak sanakee nahin banataa, to britain kii taqatvar tushtikaran lobby desh ko is yuddh se dur hi rakhti
 Hitler was not averse to British rule over India; He supported it with almost as much enthusiasm as he dreamed of Germany's rule over Britain
 lambey arase main koi bhi takat bharat ko aazaadee hasil karne se nahin roak sakati thi, lekin agar hitler ne britain ko thakaa nahin diya hota to bharat ke liye aazaadee kii ladaai hinsak or lambii prakriya ho sakati thi
 One of the greatest irony of history is that Germany was overcome by the defeat of 1945, but the British Empire never recovered even after victory
 is tathy main bhi kuch had tak vidambnaa thi ki ugr sudhaarwadi or ladaaku bose ne haripura ke apane adhyakshiya sambodhan main poonjeevaad par chot kiah ''great britain ke poonjivadi shaasha varg or videshon main sthit upniveshon main ek atoot rishta he
 "certainly Bose would not have thought that American capitalists could be spared
" ek or aakarshak paroksh tippanee main bose ne kaha ki ve aaazaad bharat main japani bahurashtriya companiyon ko sanchaalan kii ijaajat nahin denge, jabaki ve us samay japani sainikon ke saath apni mathrubhumi ko aaazaad karaane ke liye aage bad rahe the
 The conflict between idealism and pragmatism is at least as old as the germination of ideas of what modern India should be
 chah dashak ke baad ham subhash chandra bose ko bhi puujate hai or badhiya japani kaaron kii sawari bhi karte hai, ek bhartiya chhadam naam maaruti ke jhine aavaran main
 We are adept at mounting the Adarsh in the frame and hanging on the walls and taking advantage of practical opportunities
 bahurashtriya companiyaan shant or nirdayee hoti hai or unka dhyaan munaafe par rahata he
 Leaders boil over, commentators preach
 har vyakti ke paas haryana main maaruti ke kaarkaane main fat padane vaali hinsa par kehane ke liye kuch na kuch tha, lekin iske japani maalik bahut kam bole or jab aisa karnaa hua to unhone ek bhartiya ke madhyam se hi apni baat pahunchaai
 He read the chapter and verse of the factory rule book, demanded accountability for death and came back to life

 saavarkar par jari sangram ke bich rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ke netaa chagan bhujabal ne rahul gandhi kaa samarthan kiya he
 Chhagan Bhujbal said that Rahul has his own views about Savarkar
 saavarkar ne kaha tha ki gaay hamaari mata nahin he, lekin bijepi kahati he ki gaay hamaari mata he
 Savarkar's thinking was also enlightened but can the BJP accept it? Let me tell you, after the Maharashtra elections, the issue of Savarkar has once again arisen
 dilli ke ramlila maidan main congress kii 'bharat bachaao' raily main rahul gandhi ne jab kaha ki "main saavarkar nahin ki maafee maang luun
 "then the BJP also retaliated
 bijepi ke iti cell pramushmit malaviyane palatwaar karte hue apane ek twit main kaha, "nehru-gandhi parivaar kii paanch peediyaan bhi unki (saavarkar) viraasat kii barabari nahin kar saktin
 "actually, at a rally in Jharkhand on Thursday, Rahul Gandhi had said about the increasing incidents of rape in the country," Narendra Modi said - Make in India
 
 Now look wherever you are, Make in India
 
 Rape in India
 " rahul ke is bayaan par bijepi netaaon ne shuukravaar ko loksabhaa main congress par hamalaa bolte hue kaha tha ki apane bayaan ke liye rahul maafee maangen
 In this case, RSS leader Indresh Kumar also targeted Rahul Gandhi and said that even if he takes many births, Savarkar cannot be there
 indresh kumaarane yah bhi kaha ki rahul gandhi ko mahatma gandhi kaa upnaam lagaakar mahatma gandhi kaa apmaan nahin karnaa chahie

 com / l3gpsf8h9g In Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech at the United Nations General Assembly, the main emphasis will be on 'looking towards the future'
 bharat ne is bich mahasabha main pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif ke kashmir par bayaan kaa aadhikarik taur par khandan kiya he
 Nawaz Sharif called for a referendum in Jammu and Kashmir at the United Nations General Assembly
 yah puche jane par ki kya modi iskaa jawaab denge, videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa saiyad akbaruddin ne kaha ki modi ke bhaashan main 'aage kii ore dekhne' par jor hoga
 Meanwhile, India has used the right of reply to counter Pakistan's statement
 sanyukt raashtra main bharat ke pehle sachiv abhishek singh ne jawaab ke adhikaar ke tahat kaha, "main is sadan ko yah bataanaa chaahunga ki jammu-kashmir ke logon ne duniyabar main sweekrut loktantric siddhanton va vyavhaar ke anuroop apana bhavishya chunaa he or ve aage bhi aisa karte rahenge
 We therefore refute the statement of the top official of Pakistan
 " Nawaz during his address to the General Assembly termed Jammu and Kashmir as the 'main issue' and said that it should be resolved and a referendum should be held in the state
 unhone bharat par videsh sachiv str kii vaarta ko radd karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 Akbaruddin also said that there will be no talks between Modi and Sharif here
 haalanki pradhanmantri modi kii srilanka ke raashtrapati mahinda rajpakshe, bangladesh kii pradhanmantri shaikh hasina or nepal ke pradhanmantri susheel koirala se mulaakaat hogi

 vitt varsh 2018-19 main india post ko kul 15,000 karod rupee kaa ghaataa hua he
 In the last three financial years, India Post has grown by 150 per cent
 ab yah sabase zyada ghate vaali sarkari company ho gai he
 The reason for this deficit is being attributed to the expenses incurred for giving salary and other allowances to the employees
 is mad par india post ko apane salanaa rajasav kaa 90 fisadi tak kharch karnaa padataa he
 The second state-run company BSNL, notorious for the loss, has a net loss of Rs 7,500 crore in FY 2018-19 and Air India Rs 5,337 crore in FY 2017-18
 india post ko vitt varsh 2018-19 main 18,000 karod rupee kaa rajasav hasil hua tha, jabaki use vetan or bhatton main 16,620 karod rupee kharch karne pade the
 Apart from this, BSNL had to spend about Rs 9,782 crore on pension, i
e
 its total employee cost had reached to Rs 26,400 crore
 company kaa anumaan he ki vitt varsh 2020 main vetan / bhatton par kharch 17,451 karod rupee or pension par kharch 10,271 karod rupee rahegaa
 At the same time, income during this period is estimated to be only Rs 19,203 crore
 isse saaf he ki aage chalakar company kii haalat or kharaab hogi
 Efforts to improve India Post's performance and increase its revenue have not been successful due to product cost and price and the availability of cheaper and faster options than traditional postal services

 Parcel service costs 89 on average

 CM Bhupesh Baghel, after helping the SC and OBC community, has taken a big step to bring the poor upper castes into their ranks
 chhattisgarh main 82 fisadi aarakshanbta den ki chhattisgarh abhi tak asti ko 32 fisadi, essi ko 12 or obisi varg ko 14 fisadi aarakshan mil rahaa tha
 The Bhupesh Baghel government has increased the SC community's 12 per cent to 13 and the OBC community's 14 per cent to 27 per cent
 iske alaava garib savarnon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan cabinet kii manjuuri di gai
 While 32% of the ST community reservation remains intact
 is tarah se aarakshan kaa kul dayera 58 se badhaakar 82 fisadi kar diya gaya he

 After nearly a month and a half of exhausting election campaign in Bihar, the leaders are now looking for rest
 koi mandir main mattha tech rahaa he to koi yajna kii taiyaariyon main juta he
 Recently, bjp's star campaigner Manoj Tiwari returned from campaigning and enjoyed the IPL, then got involved in music and then went straight to the Mahavir temple in Patna
 jahaan unhone bhagwaan se vahi maanga jo har bhaajapai kii jubaan par he- yani apni jeet or ‘modi sarkaar’
 One more phase election is left, but now everyone is eagerly waiting for the results of the election
 khud manoj tiwari kii kismat kaa faisla bhi iviem main band he
 In such a situation, soon after getting free from the election, they reached the shelter of God
 gauratlab he ki manoj ne uttar-purvi dilli se bijepi ke tikat par chunaav ladaa he
 At 5 pm, Manoj Tiwari reached Patna Airport after campaigning and then left directly for his hotel, today was his rest day
 manoj tiwari ne hotel ke apane kamare main ipel kaa lutf uthaaya
 After a month of campaigning, Manoj Tiwari also resorted to music to relax himself in the moments of leisure
 unhone usee riyaj or usee sangeet kaa sahaara liya, jo unhen sukun detaa he
 Manoj fiercely practiced music in his room to erase the fatigue caused by the election
 ve kehete hai, ‘sangeet bahut sukun detaa he
 There is nothing better relaxing than music, music is my companion whenever i am tired or tense
 chunaav khatm hone ke baad ab ye hi meraa sahaara he
 'manoj Tiwari's second passion is cricket
 apane gaanv main sachin tendulkar kii pratimaa lagane vaale manoj tiwari ne chunaav ke maidan se sidhe ipel kaa rukh kiya
 After arriving at his hotel, Manoj is happy to see Apiel
 manoj ko sirf cricket or tivi hi nahin balki unki wo sabhaayen bhi sukun de rahi hai jinhen unhone bataur star prachaarak sambodhit kiya
 He has also captured the enthusiasm of the crowd in his mobile
 apane kamare main manoj apni sabhaaon main umadi bheed ko bhi apane mobile main dekhakar sukun kii saans lete hai or sabhi ko dikhaate bhi hai
 a month's fatigue is not going to come off in a day isliye koi mandir jane kii taiyaari main he to koi parivaar ke saath vakt bitaayega, lekin in fursat ke kshanon main bhi netaaon kii dhadakanen badi hui he ki aakhir 16 taarikh ko unka kya hoga
 Just before the Gujarat elections, the air of Hindutva started blowing

 Pointing towards the Congress, Jaitley said that before Modi ji, there was a corrupt government in Gujarat
 jetali ne centre main manmohan sarkaar par bhi nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki us samay ke pradhanmantri ke paas koi power hi nahin thi
 At that time there was a headless government
 ek samay aisa bhi aayaa jab desh main videshi nivesh ruk gaya tha
 But today the situation is such that India's position in the world class rankings of Ease of Doing Business has improved
 upi nikaay chunaav main ek baar phir iviem par sawaal uthne par jetali ne kaha ki abhi gujarat or himachal kaa rigelt to aayaa hi nahin he or vipakshi dal abhi se apni haar kaa bahaanaa dhundne main jute gaye hai
 He said that people's trust in BJP remains intact
 vahiin congress khud hi khatm hone kii kagaar par pahunch gai he
 Significantly, after the results of the civic elections, BSP supremo Mayawati and SP president Akhilesh Yadav have again accused the EVM of tampering
 gujarat main phir se sarkaar banane par jetali ne kaha ki rajya main 1980 ke dashak main bada saamaajik dhruvikaran hua
 Since then, when the BJP is in power in the state, it is constantly on the path of development
 jetali ne kaha ki ab modi ji ke desh kaa pradhanmantri banane ke baad se desh bhi vikaas kar rahaa he
 Significantly, votes will be cast in Gujarat on 9 and 14 December

 Asked or not, it is not important to me
 abhi mere liye shanti mahatvapurn he
 During this time, he dismissed allegations of spreading violence on the BJP for polarization of votes when the Aam Aadmi Party came close to the assembly elections
 unhone kaha ki dangai danga karte rahen or police mookadarshak bani rahe, yah kaise ho saktaa he
 The police took action to stop the violence, not to spread it

 singh naam se hi andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki is raashi kaa pratinidhitiv sher karata hai
 Just like a lion, the people of this zodiac are full of pride, assertiveness, strong confidence, and courageous qualities
 agar kisi mishan ke ant main ye khud ko sheersh par nahin dekhte to ye us mishan main lagate hi nahin hai
 Full of affectionate and dramatic behavior, he stands out in the crowd due to his personality and is successful in impressing with his charm
 lekin apane lakshya kii purti main ye atiaatmavishvaas or teji se aage badhate hai ki kabhi-kabhi apane dhyaan se bhatak jate hai
 However, lions are also the most vocal, sharp and insolent

 They have a strong aesthetic sense

 Delhi's CM Arvind Kejriwal and Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan are Kirashi Singh
 ab dekhte hai kisingh raashike kitne gun or kamiyaan inamen hai
 
 
 Singh rashike jatak has these characteristics
 
 
 1
 They are self-respecting and do not accept anything at the cost of their self-respect
 arvind kejariwalbaat jab parivaar kii ho to arvind kejarimwal kaa atmasamman jarur najar aata he, par apane chote se raajnneetik kariyar main unke swabhimaan ko abhimaan main tabdeel hota bhi logon ne dekha he
 Saif Ali Khan Singh Rashike is self-respecting and self-respecting among the natives
 haalanki saf ali khan main kitna swabhimaan he iskaa udhaaharan unhone saal 2012 main taj restaurant main diya, jahaan unhone south africa ke ek bijness main ko panch maar diya tha
 2
 eemaandaar hote hai
 Arvind Kejriwal started a political career against corruption and for the sake of honesty
 haalanki unke virdohi or unki hi party se alag ho chuke netaa hi un par kai baar bhrashtachar ke iljaam laga chuke hai
 Saif Ali Khansaif is firm in his work
 par unki lav life main kai ladkiyaan ain or gayi
 After love and then marriage to Amrita Singh, he married Kareena
 is bich unki life main kai ladkiyaan ain
 3
 jisase pyaar karte hai, us par sab kuch nyochaavar kar dete hai
 Arvind Kejriwal: Arvind Kejriwal's love for his family is obvious, but the love he expresses for the sake of Delhi and the country has been proved false by opponents many times
 saf ali khanjahan tak pyaar ke liye nyochaavar karne kii baat he, to saf ne haal hi main apane brother in lau ranbir kapur yani karina kapur ke bhai ke liye ek kurabaani di he
 Actually, the release date of Ranbir Kapoor's 'jagga Jasoos' and Saif Ali Khan's 'chef' was around
 isliye saf ali ne ranbir kii khatir apane film kii date october tak khiskaa di
 However, no more sacrifice was heard
 4
 Always ready to help
 arvind kejarivalrajaneedathik kariyar shuru karte hi arvind kejariwal ne bhrashtachar ke khilaaf logon kii madad karne kaa vaada kiya
 But according to his conscience, today Kejriwal has forgotten to help the people and has indulged in corruption
 yahaan tak ki virodhiyon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki ranithik kariyar shuru karne main madad karne vaale doston ko peeche chhod aage nikal chuke hai
 There are many tales of Saif Ali Khan Saif Ali Khan's friendship
 par unhone ne kisi kii koi khaas madad kii ho, aisa sunne main nahin aata
 Although Preity Zinta once saved Saif's life, Saif has helped Preity Zinta many times since then
 5
 Their willpower and self-confidence are very strong, due to which they occupy high positions even when they have less qualifications
 arvind kejarivashravind kejariwal ke liye ye baat bilkul charitaarth hoti he
 The result of his confidence is that he is the CM of Delhi today
 saf ali khanbollywood ke shuruaati daur main saf kii pahchaan kamedi actors se zyada nahin thi
 But soon he made his mark in the film's superstar category Katgari
 singh raashi main ye kamiyaan bhi hoti hai
 
 
 1
 aawaaj tikhi va vaani prakhar hoti he
 Arvind Kejriwal, who raised his voice against corruption, whenever speaking against his opponents, some speak bitterly
 khaastaur se desh ke piem narendra modi ke liye wo jab bhi bolte hai, unki aawaaj main talkhi mahasoos kii ja sakati he
 Saif Ali Khan, this chocolate hero of Bollywood is very much liked by girls for his sweet dialect
 haalanki bhai-bhatijawad, ajaan aadi ke mudde par saf kii kai baar twiltor par tikhi pratikriya aa chuki he
 2
 ye vyakti ahamkaari hote hai
 Arvind Kejriwal Dharna, who started a political career with a protest, often accuses Kejriwal of being arrogant
 saf ali khanhaalanki bollywood main saf ko log kool dud kehete hai
 But Saif Ali Khan's arrogance was seen when a businessman asked him and his friends not to make noise at the dinner table
 saf ne badale main use ghusaa maar diya tha
 2
 shashan karne kii pravriti janmajaat hoti he
 Arvind Kejriwal Looking at Arvind Kejriwal in the beginning, you could not have guessed that this simple looking man is going to take command of the country's capital Delhi
 lekin baad main jo hua, usase ye sabit ho jaataa he ki shashan kii pravriti unamem janmajaat he
 These properties can also be seen in Saif Ali Khan, the heir to the unfathomable wealth of the Saif Ali Khanapataudi family
 wo pataudi riyasat ke vaaris hai
 3
 kisi kaa virodh inhen sahan nahin hota
 Arvind Kejriwal Although no one likes his opposition, but the reference to Arvind Kejriwal is accurate because he gives the procedure soon
 virodhiyon kii maane to party ke andar kejariwal kaa virodh karne vaale logon ko wo pasand nahin karte or unhen baahar kaa rasta dekhnaa padataa he
 Saif Ali Khansaif remains in a calm and jolly mood
 par kabhi-kabhi virodhiyon ke saamne unke kadave tevar bhi dekhne ko milte hai
 Through the tweet, he has given tough answers to his opponents many times

 Sukesh Chandrasekhar, accused of dealing with Sasikala's nephew Dinakaran for Rs 60 crores, is in the custody of Delhi Police for getting the AIADMK party's symbol back
 sukesh or uski garlfriend leena maaria kai sau karod kii thagi kar chuke hai
 Both of them became Natwarlal to fulfill their expensive hobbies
 logon ko lakhon-karodon kaa chuunaa lagaate rahe
 The captivating but tricky hypnotic power of this heroine had put a whole convoy of the world's most beautiful and expensive cars in her stables
 jaraa sochie jab ek se chaar karod tak kii kaaron main baith kar jab wo duniya ko chuunaa lagane nikalati hogi, to bhala uske bhaukaal or khubsuurati ke jaal main funskar koun khud ko naa fansaa detaa hoga?ji haa, tollywood yani dakshin kii filmon se bollywood main entry maarane ja rahi heroin leena maaria kii jo kahani saamne aa rahi he, use dekhte hue khud pulisavaale use ladi natvarlaal se kam khitaab dene ko taiyaar nahin he
 Leena and her boyfriend, who were arrested on 27 May 2013 under the joint operation of Delhi and Chennai police, have several charges against them
 pichley ek saal main hi desh bhar main kai logon ko kai sau karod kaa chuunaa laga chuke hai
 These include some national banks
 ye sara kaam wo apane premi ke saath mil kar karti thi, jo pehle se thagi ke dhandhe main tha
 Both used to meet businessmen ranging from businessmen to government banks in red lights or expensive cars
 is dauraan maaria kaa istemaal baby doll ke taur par hota
 Boyfriends used to do deals and girlfriends would help them take them with their savory actions
 2011 main maaria dubai se padhai puri karne ke baad modelling kii duniya main kismat aajamaane mumbai pahunchi
 There he met Sukesh Chandrasekhar
 mahangi gadiyon main ghoomane, kapade pahanane or five star rahan-sahan jaldi hi donon ko kareeb laayaa
 Meanwhile, the two fell in love
 iske baad sukesh ne maaria ko modelling ke kuch asinament dilaae or phir apane saath chennai le gaya
 In Chennai, Maria got the lead role of heroine in many films with the help of Sukesh and she became famous in Tollywood on seeing her
 baad main maaria ko pataa chalaa ki sukesh kii sari kamai kaa jariya dhokhadhadi he
 Sukesh, a fluent English-speaking person, calls himself an IAS officer and takes money from a businessman or a loan from a bank to get new projects passed
 iske baad paisa haath aate hi wo khisak letaa
 For this he made Maria his partner
 kehete hai ki chennai main sukesh or maaria ne milakar saikadon logon ko karodon kaa chuunaa lagaaya
 The exploits of these two came to the foremost headlines when Sukesh took a loan of 19 crore 75 lakhs from Chennai's Canara Bank with the help of Maria and then the money disappeared
 sukesh ne bank main khud ko iees bataaya tha
 On the complaint of the bank, the police started searching for both

 Both were living in a live-in relationship in this form house rented for four lakh rupees a month
 bhale hi chandrayan-2 mishan main bhartiya antariksh agency isro (indian Space Research Organisation - ISRO) ko ek jhatka laga ho, uskaa vikram lander se sampark tut gaya ho
 But, ISRO scientists are still trying to contact Vikram
 ab to isro ke saath america antariksh agency nasa bhi isro kii madad kar rahi he
 But, meanwhile, former director of isro's Space Application Center Ahmedabad and Adjunct Professor of IIT Kharagpur, Tapan Mishra explained what could be the three major reasons for the deterioration of the mission
 professor tapan mishra ne apane soshal media account par charanbaddh tareeke se samajhaayaa ki kaise landing main gadabadi ai hogi or kahaan dhyaan dene kii jarurat thi
 2
 1 KM nahin, 335 meter par tutaa tha vikram se ISRO kaa sampark, ye graph he sabutaie
 
 
 Now know that Prof
 tapan mishra ne teen bade kaaran kya bataae1
 The thrusters did not start simultaneously at the right time
 Vikram Lander 1 at an altitude of 30 km from the lunar surface
 66 kimi prati second kii raftaar se chakkar laga rahaa tha
 When he had to land on the lunar surface, Vikram Lander had to be upright and his speed should be 2 meters per second
 vikram lander main paanch bade thrusters hai
 Who would have helped him in landing
 inhi thrusters kii madad se vikram lander ne chand ke chaaron taraf chakkar bhi lagaae the
 Apart from these, there are 8 small thrusters on Vikram Lander
 thrusters chote rocket jaise hote hai jo kisi vastu aage yaa peeche badhaane main madad karte hai
 Had been the orbiter of Chandrayaan-2 for 1 year, know how Kampanch was engaged under big thrusters Vikram for 7 years
 chaar thrusters chaar konon main or ek bich main
 These would have helped Vikram move up and down
 jabaki, 8 chote thrusters vikram kii disha nirdhaaran main madad karte
 It may be that at the altitude of 400 meters above the lunar surface, all the big thrusters do not have fuel simultaneously
 isse ye hua hoga ki saare thrusters ekasaath start na hue hon
 The result is that the lander must have moved rapidly and lost balance
 is samay lander vaise hi gum rahaa hoga jaisi diwali main chakri aatishbaajee gumti he
 2
 sahi samay or sahi maatra main eendhan ingine tak na pahunchaa hovikram lander kaa bada hissaa eendhan kii tank he
 Due to the high speed of the lander, braking, the fuel will be bouncing in its tank in the same way as water bounces in the water tub
 isse ingine ke nojal main eendhan sahi se nahin pahunchaa hoga
 Because of this, the landing can cause disturbances due to the lack of full fuel to the thrusters at the time of landing
 30 kimi kii oonchai se 400 meter kii oonchai tak aane main vikram lander kii gati 1
 66 km / s (6000 km / h) and 60 m / s (200 km / h)
 lander ki disha bhi horijontal se vertical ho chuki thi
 Four thrusters at the corners were working throughout this time while the middle thruster was off
 Vikram Lander se sampark ho yaa na ho, ISRO ke naam darj ho gayi ye 6 uplabdhiyaan400 meter kii oonchai par lander kii disha vertical ho gai
 Two of the four lower thrusters were turned off and two smaller side-mounted thrusters were turned on so that Vikram could hover like a helicopter and find the right place for landing
 lekin yaheen kahin par kisi thruster ne vikram kaa saath nahin diya
 This may have happened because the fuel did not reach all the working thrusters simultaneously
 3
 Could not fight with the gravitational force of the moon, Vikram Lander cruised like a helicopter at an altitude of 100 meters above the surface of Vikramchand
 chand kii gurutvkarshan shakti ko bardaasht karne ke liye agal-bagal ke chote thrusters on rahete
 The lander's camera would spot the landing and then descend
 camere se lee gai tasviir onboard computer main store kii gai tasviir se match karti
 After this, Vikram Lander stopped hovering and slowly shut down four big thrusters and came down with the help of middle fifth thruster
 is vakt vikram lander main laga radar ultimetre lander kii oonchai kaa khyaal rakhata
 Since the landing was fully automatic, it could not be controlled from the earth
 yaheen par gurutvkarshan ko vikram lander bhaanp nahin paaya hoga, kyonki vahaan gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav main badlaav aata rahata he
 What kind of reward? Government cut salary of ISRO scientists before Chandrayaan-2 gajiabad kii aath lakh kii aabaadi vaale line paar kshetra ke logon ne aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav kaa bahishkaar karne kaa faisla kiya he
 People have taken this step because of ignoring their demand for construction of ROB to connect the area to the main city
 is babat baqayada ilaake ke logon ne kshetra main hordings lagaakar sabhi rajnatik dalon ko chunauti di he
 If you go to Ghaziabad, then definitely see the hoarding outside the railway station
 us hording par saaf taur par bade-bade aksharon main likhaa he ki dhobighat par railway over brij nahin to vot nahin
 Through similar hoardings on all the intersections and intersections of the area, people have clearly warned that if the railway over bridge connecting the area to the main city is not built before the Lok Sabha elections, they will boycott the election
 darasal, gajiabad railway stesan or uske sidhi taraf railway line ke sahare ke ilaake ko line paar kshetra ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 There are about seventy small and big colonies in this area as well as 14 municipal wards
 baavjood iske ilaake ke logon ko yahaan se shahar jane ke liye sirf railway ke pul kaa sahaara he
 That too only and only on foot
 haalat ye hai ki yadi is ilaake main kisi kii haalat bighad jaae to use bade aspataal le jane ke liye kai kilometre en
 H
 24 par chalakar shahar kii taraf janaa padataa he
 Due to this, people of the area have been demanding to build ROB over the railway line at Dhobighat for the past several years
 shahar jane or vahaan se ilaake main aane ke liye koi sugam rasta nahin hone kii vajah se majaboor logon ko aksar railway lines se hokar guzarana padataa he, jisaki vajah se aae din logon kii train kii chapet main aane se maut bhi hoti rahati he
 People have alleged that during the elections, all political parties promise votes for ROB construction and collect votes and support from the people of the area, but no one has tried in this direction
 tamaam rajnatik dalon ke netaaon or loksabhaa pratyaashiyon ko aath lakh kii aabaadi vaale is ilaake ke logon ne khuli chetavanee to de di he, magar is par abhi kisi bhi dal ke netaa bolne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 It remains to be seen whether political parties take any initiative regarding ROB to take credit of this demand of the people or the people of this area will have to show their opposition by boycotting the elections

 jaswant singh baghawat kar chuke hai
 From Barmer, Rajasthan, he has filed a nomination against bjp's authorized candidate Colonel Sonaram Chaudhary
 bijepi abhi chodi nahin he, is intjaar main hai ki party unhen nikaale
 On the other hand, BJP is waiting for the last date and time for withdrawal of nominations
 uske baad hi unhen party se nikaala jaae
 Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj have given statements about Jaswant Singh
 rajnath singh ne kaha ki jaswant party ke varisht netaa hai, lekin unhen tikat na dene kaa faisla bataate samay unase khed vyakt kiya tha
 Jaitley has said that leaders in the party have to get into the habit of listening 'no'
 vahiin sushamaa ne kah diya he ki unhen is faisle se dukh he or kendriya chunaav samiti kii baithak main ye faisla nahin hua tha
 On the other hand, Jaswant's attack on BJP leaders continues
 rajnath singh or vasundhara raaje ko unhone gaddaar bataaya he
 Jaitley has been called an ambitious leader
 jaswant singh party ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi par hamalaa karne main bhi peeche nahin rahe hai
 He has associated the chanting of namo-namo in BJP with the mentality of Emergency
 jaswant singh ne kaha he, "ye jo namo, namo nirnay lene kii prakriya shuru hui he, ye mujhe 1975 kii yaad dilaataa he
 It has more ego
 party jis tarah se ek hi vyakti par kendrit kar rahi he, ye thik nahin he
 It cannot work in democracy
 " These are the words of Jaswant Singh who revolted after not getting the ticket
 jaahir he unhen tikat na milane se pidaa hui he or yahi dard in bayanon ke jariye baahar nikal rahaa he
 But the question arises that if he had got the ticket, would he still have said the same thing? shaayad nahin
 This is indicated by the book 'modiism - the basic mantra of development and optimism' released by the Citizen for Accountable Governance (CAG) on Narendra Modi's policies

 Underlining the mystic significance in Indian culture of issue 14, Jaswant writes that 14 gems were extracted from the churning of the ocean, Lord Shri Ram also came to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile
 isi tarah 2014 badlaav kaa varsh hoga, jiske liye lambey samay se desh aas lagaae baitha he
 Jaswant Singh further refers to the slogans of Narendra Modi mentioned in the book, inspired by 14 quotes
 jaswant singh likhte hai, "prayek uddhran ek vichaar kaa pratik he, jise agar sahi dhang se lagu kiya jaae, to bharat ko badalane main madad mil sakati he
 Mr
 Modi has not only spoken on these issues, he has also implemented them very effectively during his tenure as the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 " That is, Jaswant Singh does not appear to be avoiding Modiism, the concept which came out in the name of Modi
 balki vah ise bharat ko badalane main madadgaar bhi maanate hai
 The same Jaswant Singh is now complaining that the 'namo-namo' happening in the BJP is reminding him of the Emergency and the party is getting personalized

 The 79-run defeat at the hands of Bangladesh in the Mirpur ODI has been described by Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni as a hurting
 team india is muqaabale main puure 50 over tak ballebaazi nahin kar saki or bangladesh ke kilaaf ranon ke hisaab se team ko sabase sharmnaak haar jhelni padi
 According to Dhoni, the biggest reason for the defeat was not the partnership of Indian batsmen
 haar ke baad dhoni ne kaha, "jab aap 300 se zyaada ranon kaa peechha karte hai, to saajhedaari kii bhoomika ahm hoti he
 Having a large partnership makes it easier for middle order and low order batsmen
 mere khyaal se hamaare wicket lagaataar girte rahe
 Our batsmen could not form any partnership
 "tippaniyan Although Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan shared a 95-run partnership for the first wicket from India, but after the break up of this partnership, India's top four wickets fell within just 20 runs
 dhoni ne is jeet ke liye bangladeshi gendbaazon kii bhi koob taareef kii
 He said, "he used variety in his bowling
 ve 140 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar se gendbaazi nahin kar rahe the or na hi 115 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar se
 He blended well and his bowlers achieved more bounce than wickets
 " Team India could not bat for the entire 50 overs in this match and the team suffered the most embarrassing defeat in terms of runs against Bangladesh
 dhoni ke mutabik haar kii sabase badi vajah bhartiya ballebaazon kaa saajhedaari nahin bananaa rahaa
 After the defeat, Dhoni said, "when you chase over 300 runs, the role of partnership is important
 badi saajhedaari hone se middle order auki lo order ke ballebaazon ko aasaani hoti he
 i think our wickets kept falling continuously
 hamaare ballebaaz koi saajhedaari nahin bana paae
 "comments vaise bharat kii ore se rohit sharma or shikhar dhawan ne pehle wicket ke liye 95 ran kii saajhedaari nibhaai, lekin is saajhedaari ke tuutane ke baad bharat ke top chaar wicket mahaj 20 ran ke bheetar gir gaye
 Dhoni also praised the Bangladeshi bowlers for this victory
 unhone kaha, "unhone apni gendbaazi main vividhta kaa istemaal kiya
 He was not bowling at 140 kilometers per hour, nor at 115 kilometers per hour
 unhone achche se mishran kiya or unke gendbaazon ne wicket se zyaada oochaal hasil kiya

 bihar ke purv siem or mahadalit netaa jeethanram maanjhi ke raajnneetik jivan kaa pahiyaa ghumkar ek baar phir vahiin aa gaya he, jahaan se unhone shuruyaat kii thi
 Yes, Jitan Ram Manjhi, who once contested on the Congress and RJD tickets, has decided to include his party Hindustani Awam Morcha in the Bihar Grand Alliance
 maanjhi ne choda rajg kaa sathbijepi ke saath bihar vidhansabha 2015 kaa chunaav ladane vaale hindustani awam morcha (HAM) ke adhyaksh or bihar ke purv siem jeethanram maanjhirajg se algaho gaye hai
 With this, Manjhi has formed a political alliance with RJD on the invitation of Tejashwi
 bihar chunaav main mili thi ek sitjithanram maanjhi ko jediu main rahete hue kabhi nitish kii kursi di gai, to kabhi chin lee gai
 After separating from JDU, formed a new party HAM and joined the NDA to contest the 2015 election, but could win only one seat
 bihar 2015 ke chunaav main argedy, jediu, congress, sapa, ensipi ke mahagathbandhan ko safalataa mili
 Nitish Kumar NCM and Lalu Yadav's son Tejashwi Yadav took over as deputy CM
 haalanki is mahagathbandhan main july, 2017 ko daraar pad gai or jediu ne bijepi ke saath sarkaar bana lee
 When CM did not want to leave the post, Jitan Ram Manjhi, who was SC and ST minister in the Manjinitish government, became the Chief Minister of Bihar on 20 May 2014 as Nitish Kumar resigned taking responsibility for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki 22 farvari 2015 ko nitish kumaar maanjhi ko hataakar phir se siem ban gaye
 During that time Manjhi did not want to leave the post of CM and Manjhi had also tried hard to save his chair
 rah chuke hai congress or argedy ke sadsysaal 1990 tak maanjhi congress sadsy rahe or congress ke tikat par 1980 se 1990 tak vidhayak bane
 Manjhi then joined the RJD and contested elections from 1996 to 2005 MLA
 saal 2005 main unhone jediu jwoin kar lee
 When Manjhi was removed from the post of CM in February 2015, he announced to form his new party
 maanjhi ne 8 may, 2015 ko aupchaarik taur par hindustani awam morcha naam kii party banaai, jise chunaav ayog kii ore se july 2015 main manyata di gai
 At present, the stigma of the infamy of Muzaffarpur Shelter Home in Bihar has not been left untouched by the government that the embarrassment of Asra Shelter Home in Patna shook the whole of Bihar again within a month
 darasal, patna ke aasraa shelter home se 10 agast ko kuch mahilaon ne bhaagane kii koshish kii, par naakaam raheen
 The same night, two women from the shelter home are found dead
 ab do mahilaon kii sandigdh maut ke baad jab uski sanchalika or maalik ko police giraftaar karti he
 Then comes the truth of his attitude in the corridor of politics, which has again created a stir in the politics of Bihar
 prabhaavshaalee logon se sambandhuski muskuraati hui tasviir main bihar main raajnneeti ke sabase bade fareb kii khoj jari he
 When the search for his friends began, such faces began to appear that people's tongues were left open
 darasal, aasraa shelter home kii sanchalikamanisha dayalbihar kii galakat raajnneeti main daleey dwesh kaa pul thi
 Shyam Rajak of RJD used to spread his eyes and feet, and he had to sit up with Mrityunjay Tiwari
 purv mantri shivacharan das bhi uske swaagat main khadey rahete the
 Manisha used to be in Jalwa in Bihar
 or hota bhi kaise nahin
 For this, big ministers used to decorate dastarkhwans in welcome
 vipaksh ke mananeey bhi unki samajaseva ke peeche lattu the
 And this process would have continued if the bodies of two women did not come out of the Asra Home in Patna
 or ye bhed na khulata ki unki laashon ko jabaran thikaane lagane kii koshish hui he
 These dms are amazing! Amazing dms of amazing style posted in Patna, they sometimes incarnate in centuries
 itnaa kuch ho jane ke baad hosh nahin aayaa tha ki chalem jaraa jile ke shelter homes kii haalat dekh len
 It is said that DM Sahib used to be a special officer of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 ab jab maathe par siem kaa haath to phikr kii kya baat
 Go to office comfortably, eat tea and snacks
 gap ladaate or aakar chaiyn se so jate
 But this sleep was disturbed on Saturday, when two women of Asra Shelter Home died suspiciously
 aasraa shelter home ne ise nipataane kii koshish kii or bhed khul gaya
 The search for the owner of Manishasara Shelter Home is the operator of the shelter home
 pataa chalaa manisha dayaal kii maaya he iske peeche
 Manisha Dayal is the secretary of Asra Home
 or maalik hua karte hai chinratan kumaar
 In the name itself, contemplation and uplifting
 koun kya bigaadta
 Night and night there were voices of screaming girls screaming from the shelter homes
 wo dehshat main kaanpatin thi
 But nobody opened the tongue
 nahin hui ladakiyon kii sunwaayeeladkiyaan jab chikhti to puure mohalle kii neend uchat jaati
 But who listens in the government
 kyonki nitish kumaar kii party se lekar tejasvi yadav tak kii party main manisha dayaal kii seva main tatpar rahane vaale bade-bade netaa the
 Manisha Dayal used to be a bridge of emotion between those who raise questions and those who answer
 uske paroapkaar ke kadradaan unke liye line se uthakar khadey rahete the
 The big leaders used to put the line, Manisha Dayal had set the line of voluntary organizations
 aasraa home ko chalaane vaale anumaaya human risource foundation ke alaava kam se kam 5 swayamsevi sansthaaon ke jariye wo saamaajik utthan main lagi hui thi
 Now the police is trying to find out what was so important in Manisha Dayal that big leaders used to stand with folded hands as soon as they came in front of them
 madhyapradesh vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh ajay singh ne aarope lagaaya he ki pradesh main bhaajapa main chal rahi antarkalah ke kaaran sarkaar asthir he or mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kaa shashan evam prashasan par niyantran nahin rah gaya he

 Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar launched an 'anti Wrangling Mobile App' created by University Grants Commission (UGC) in Delhi
 mantri ne kaha ki is mobile aplication se chaatro ko raging kii samasya se nipatane main madad milegi

 Apart from this, they will also be punished for this according to the law

 Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) is sitting in Hyderabad called IT Hub, so his move will not seem so unique that he is presenting a 3D powerpoint presentation in the Assembly regarding his promises made during elections
 
 
 ab bhale hi 62-varshiya mukhyamantri nae vakt ke saath chalane kii koshish kar rahe hai, lekin duusari taraf vipakshi congress kaa kahana he ki vah aisa katai nahin chaahati
 
 
 The Congress, which won 21 of the 119 seats in the Telangana Legislative Assembly, is not participating in this presentation on the state's irrigation projects, which according to them is 'against the traditions of the Legislative Assembly', and would set a wrong precedent
 vidhansabha main teen sadasyon vaala anya vipakshi dal telugudesham party (tidipi) bhi pressentation kaa bahishkaar kar rahi he
 The Congress says that if KCR would give a presentation in this way, then the debates going on in the Vidhan Sabha in a good and traditional way will also get entangled in technical debate from the beginning in the future
 tippaniyan Significantly, after the formation of Telangana, the Congress had to face a tough defeat in the first election in 2014, while in undivided Andhra Pradesh, the Congress held power for many years
 vaise, telugana ke vidhayak isse pehle bhi isi saptaah surkhiyon main aae the, jab unhone apane vetan ko 160 pratishat badhaane kaa prastaav ekamat se paarit kiya tha
 He also faced a lot of criticism for the move, as farmers in his state have been struggling with debt and drought, and since the state was formed, more than 2,100 farmers have committed suicide

 The Telugu Desam Party (TDP), another opposition party with three members in the assembly, is also boycotting the presentation

 The telecom companies are warning that Airtel recently wrote a letter to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) warning that if Jio's ring time is maintained, other telecom companies can also reduce the ring time to 20 seconds for outgoing calls
 Huh
 airtel ne tri se anurodh kiya tha ki vah jeeyo se ring time badhaane ko kahe
 Economic Times quoted a source as saying, "reliance Jio has increased the ring time for its outgoing call to 25 seconds
 yah ek tarah kaa antarim kadam he or company is bare main tri ke guideline kaa intjaar kar rahi he
 In a letter to TRAI, Airtel has alleged that Jio is tampering with interconnection usage charge (IUC) by reducing ring time
 airtel ne kaha he ki kam samay ke ring alert kaa matlab yah he ki miss kol zyada hoga or is tarah se jeeyo ke network main zyada ritern phone kol honge
 Airtel says that this could cut down on IUC payments to Jio dependent company
 haalanki jeeyo ne in aaropon ko khaarij karte hue kaha he ki 15-20 second duniya bhar main apanaaya jane vaala maanak he
 This issue was discussed in the TRAI meeting on 6 September
 is baithak main airtel, vodaphone idia,beasenel or emtnael ne kisi kol ke jawaab ke liye kam se kam 30 second ke ring time rakhane kii baat kaa samarthan kiya tha
 However, Jio said that the ring time should be 25 seconds, Jio claimed that 20 seconds is enough for a call-side to respond and that more time is a waste of spectrum resources
 jeeyo ke ek varisht sutara ne akhbaar se kaha ki 6 sitambar ko hone vaali baithak se ab tak jeeyo ke rukh main koi badlaav nahin he or company ko is bare main regulator se koi nirdesh nahin mila he
 TRAI has issued a consultation paper seeking suggestions in this regard and has asked the telecom companies to reach a consensus before finalizing this paper
 shuukravaar ko nirdeshak avinaash das kii pehali film 'anaarakali of aara' relies hui he
 Avinash Das has directed both the film and its story
 is film main swara bhaskar anaarakali ke mukhya kirdaar main hai
 Apart from Swara, Sanjay Mishra, Pankaj Tripathi, Ishtiaq Khan and Vijay are playing important roles in this film
 is film main anaarakali aara kii rahane vaali ek naachne-gane vaali ladki he or wo rangila dance party main naach ga kar apni jeevika chalaati he
 Anarkali is very well known in her area and her list of appreciation ranges from ordinary people to the influential people of the area
 lekin anaarakali ke liye mushkil tab khadi hoti he jab ilaake kii ek badi shakhsiyat anaarakali ke hunar kaa nahin balki uski khubsuurati kaa divaana ban jaataa he
 Now after this, what troubles arise for Anarkali and after all what you say, you will have to go to theaters to see this story
 isse pehle main aapako is film kii kuch khaamiyon or khoobiyon par najar daal len
 Tell me about the flaws, i think a lot of time has been taken to set the film's characters
 jaise film kii shuruyaat main kaaphi lambey samay tak gaanaa bajaanaa hota he
 Also, it has taken a long time for Anarkali's fame, the characters around her and the characters of her appreciation to take a long time to slow down
 saath hi shuruyaat main screenple thodaa bikharaa lagata he
 The basis of this film is made in Bihar, so it is possible that some viewers may have some difficulty in understanding the language or the humor here
 tippaniyan While talking about the merits of this film, its biggest strength is its subject, its story, its script and its dialogue
 saath hi jab ye sab bihar kii prishthbhumi par ghatit hota he to isamen manoranjan kaa tadakaa or majboot ho jaataa he
 Although the screenplay is a little shaky, but the music of the film and the acting of the actors do not let you realize it
 film kaa har actor apni kasuti par khara utarataa he or unka abhinay drishyon main dam bhar detaa he
 Swara Bhaskar's best acting will not let you lose sight of him, while Ishtiaq Khan takes the lead in every scene
 sanjay mishra bejod actor hai or unhone ek baar phir sabit kiya he ki film industry ko unhen kamedi se hat kar bhi dekhnaa chahie
 While the film has a message in it, it also has the humor in many scenes
 haalanki yah film bhi 'pink' kii tarah hi yahi sandesh detii he ki 'na kaa matlab na hota he' or bina marji ke jor jabardastee galat he
 This is a good film to watch
 is film ke liye meri reating he 3
 5 stars khaamiyon kii bataa karen to mujhe lagata he kii film ke kirdaaron ko set karne main kaaphi vakt le liya gaya he
 Like in the beginning of the film, the song has to be played for a long time
 saath hi anaarakali kii shoharat, uske aas paas ke kirdaar or uske kadradaanon ke kirdaaron ko khadaa karne main kaaphi lanbaa samay liya gaya he jisase film kii shuruyaat dhimi pad jaati he
 Also the screenplay seems a bit scattered in the beginning
 is film kaa aadhaar bihar kaa banaaya gaya he isliye ho saktaa he ki kuch darshakon ko bhashaa yaa yahaan ke hasya bhav ko samajhane main thodi pareshaani aae
 The comments vahiin is film kii khoobiyon kii baat karen to isaki sabase badi takat he iskaa vishay, isaki kahani , isaki script or iske dialog
 Also, when all this happens on the backdrop of Bihar, then the temper of entertainment in it becomes stronger
 haalanki screenple main thodaa jhol he lekin film kaa sangeet or kalakaaron kaa abhinay aapako iskaa ahsaas hone nahin detaa
 Every actor of the film meets his test and his acting fills the scenes
 swara bhaskar kaa behtareen abhinay unase aapako nazren hataane nahin degaa, vahiin ishtiya khan apane har seen main baaji maar le jate hai
 Sanjay Mishra is an unmatched actor and he has once again proved that the film industry should look beyond comedy
 is film main jahaan ek sandesh he vahiin isamen kai seens main humor bhi he
 However, this film also gives the same message like 'pink' that 'no means no' and forcefully without will is wrong
 yah ek acchhee film he jise dekhnaa chahie
 My rating for this film is 3
 5 stars
 While talking about the merits of this film, its biggest strength is its subject, its story, its script and its dialogue
 saath hi jab ye sab bihar kii prishthbhumi par ghatit hota he to isamen manoranjan kaa tadakaa or majboot ho jaataa he
 Although the screenplay is a little shaky, but the music of the film and the acting of the actors do not let you realize it

 5 stars is dauraan chif justise ne kaha kii NGT logon kii bhalaai ke liye nae kadam uthaa rahaa he, lihaaza ham sabko is kaam main uskaa sahyog karnaa chahie
 On Monday, the Supreme Court rejected the petition, saying that the court would not interfere with the ngt's orders
 yachika main NGT ke do adeshon par roak lagane kii maang bhi kii gai thi
 In this, orders were issued on March 4, 2015 to remove 10-year-old diesel vehicles and in September 2014 to remove 15-year-old petrol trains from Delhi's roads
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki NGT is tarah ke aadesh jari nahin kar saktaa, kyonki ye motor whical act kaa maamla he or isamen sirf kendra sarkaar hi badlaav kar sakati he
 The orders given in the NGT are outside its jurisdiction
 saath kii ye bhi kaha gaya ki ye act puure desh ke liye he aise main sirf dilli ke liye alag se kanoon nahin ho saktaa
 The comments lekin supreme court ne kaha ki NGT vahi aadesh de rahaa he jo adaalatein de chuki hai
 The order to remove 15 year old vehicles was first given by the Andhra Pradesh High Court, which was approved by the Supreme Court
 ab jab NGT logon kii bhalaai ke liye kaam kar rahaa he to sabko sahyog karnaa chahie na ki uske kaam main roda atkana chahie
 With this, the court dismissed this petition
 somvaar ko supreme court ne yachika ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki court NGT ke adeshon main dakhal nahin degaa
 The petition also sought stay on two orders of the NGT
 isamen 4 march 2015 ko 10 saal puraani deazal kii gadiyon ko hataane or sitambar 2014 main 15 saal puraani petrol gadiyon ko dilli kii sadakon se hataane ke aadesh jari kiye gaye the
 The petition said that the NGT cannot issue such orders as it is a matter of the Motor Vehicle Act and only the central government can make changes in it
 NGT main jo aadesh die hai wo uske adhikaar kshetra se baahar hai
 Along with that it was also said that this act is for the whole country, in such a situation, there cannot be a separate law for Delhi alone
 tippaniyan But the Supreme Court said that the NGT is giving the same order which the courts have given
 15 saal puraani gadiyon ko hataane ke aadesh sabase pehle andhra pradesh hai court ne die the, jin par supreme court ne muhar lagaai thi
 Now when the NGT is working for the betterment of the people, everyone should cooperate and not stall its work
 iske saath hi court ne ye yachika khaarij kar di

 abhi pichley saal march main hi to amit shah rajya ke netaa se bijepi ke rashtriya mahasachiv banaae gaye the
 On 9 July, he was made the president of the party
 50 varsh puure karne se mahaj teen maah dur shah is pad par pahunchane vaale sabase kam umr ke netaa hai
 In this emergence in the party organization, under his supervision in the Lok Sabha elections, the unique success of the party in Uttar Pradesh became an important ladder
 party rajya kii 80 siton main se 78 par ladi or 71 jeet gai
 However, the inclusion of Shah's fortune in some similar cases ignores the whole story
 shah ke is ubhaar main bijepi ke maamalon ko lekar aresas or pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bich najuk santulan kaa bhi apana sthaan he
 Ministries like Modi allotted and his policy decisions taken in the last eight weeks clearly show that he has complete control over the government
 ab apane pramukh sipahasaalar ko party adhyaksh banaakar modi aresas ko alag-thalag kiye bina bijepi kii bagdor bhi apane haath main lene kii taiyaari kar chuke hai
 Shah has already shown that he is adept at finding a common ground between the rss's aspirations and Modi's intentions by carrying out election campaign in Uttar Pradesh and new ethnic mobilization in Bihar
 yah saz jameen ab party ko mili baari jeet ke phaaydon ko majboot karnaa he
 a senior BJP leader associated with the campaign for the Lok Sabha elections told India Today, "as long as the party keeps winning elections, the RSS is ready to give Modi a waiver
 ” shah ne uttar pradesh main apane prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan april ke pehle hafte main mujffarnagar, shamali or bijanour main apni sabhaaon main logon se ‘apmaan kaa badla’ lene ke liye bijepi ko vot dene kii apil kii
 They were alluding to communal riots in the area a few months ago, which left Jats and Muslims thirsting for each other's blood
 shah ke khilaaf police ne maamla darj kiya or chunaav ayog ne un par pabandi lagaai lekin unke bhaashanon se votaron ke dhruvikaran main madad mili or uttar pradesh main bijepi kii siten 10 se sidhe 71 ho gayi
 BJP leader says, "mission 272+ was Shah's thinking and came true
 party kaaryakarta bahumat ke lakshya se behad utsahit ho uthe
 "similarly, the party is planning to set such targets in the contested states in the near future
 isliye bataur party adhyaksh shah kii yojanaon kii haryana, maharashtra, jharkhand or dilli ke aagaamee chunaavon main pariksha hogi
 In January 2013, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, who took over the reins of party president from Nitin Gadkari, nominated Shah for the remaining year and a half of his term
 yah kaarykaal 2016 main khatm hoga
 Shah had to beat Rajasthan BJP president Om Mathur and former Himachal Pradesh minister and party general secretary Jagat Prakash Nadda
 haalanki maathur ko rajasthan main november 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaavon or loksabhaa chunaavon main bhi party ko baari kamyaabi dilaane kaa shrey maujuuda mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke saath mila he lekin donon netaaon ke bich madhur sambandh nahin bataae jate
 This confrontation is said to play a major role in ending Mathur's prospect, though he has been Modi's former ally in Gujarat
 nadda ko chupchaap ji-jaan se kaam karne vaala mahasachiv mana jaataa he jinhone aam chunaavon ke dauraan party sanghathan ko majboot karne main pramukh bhoomika nibhaai
 But there are allegations against him of sowing seeds of discord in the Himachal Pradesh BJP, which the party had to bear the brunt of in the 2012 assembly elections
 bijepi sansadeey board kii baithak main shah ke naam par muhar lagane ke baad ek varisht kendriya mantri ne kaha, “sirf shah or susheel modi kii shakhsiyat adhyaksh pad ke liye feet baithti thi
 It was decided that Sushil should be kept free for the candidature of the Chief Minister of Bihar, leaving only Shah
 ”haalanki yah faisla ekadam sahaj nahin tha
 Since cases of fake encounters are pending against Shah and he is close to Modi, the RSS also considered other names
 lekin aakhir main usne hathiyaar daal die
 The big reason for this was that Amit Shah had managed to keep the RSS workers happy during his campaign
 unhone sangh ke netaaon sunil bansal or krishna gopal ke saath kaam kiya
 Bansal was handling the BJP Warroom in Lucknow
 loksabhaa chunaav main shah kii team ke saath kaam kar chuke or 2012 main sangh se bijepi main aae ek netaa kehete hai, “sampark or soochna ke aadan-pradaan or aresas kaaryakartaaon ke saath talmail main shah kaa jawaab nahin
 "apart from this, the Sangh also did not want a replay of the earlier NDA government of 1998 to 2004, when the BJP was led by relatively smaller leaders like Bangaru Laxman and Kushabhau Thackeray
 vaajapeyi mantrimandal main rah chuke ek netaa kehete hai, “vankaiya naidu ke alaava atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa duusare party adhyakshon khaskar janaa krishnamurthi or thakare ke saath koi khaas talmail nahin tha
 In the words of this leader, the result was that the party was very weak when the NDA term ended in 2004
 aresas chahta he ki party un ilaakon main apni sthiti majboot kare jahaan use 2014 ke chunaavon main badhat hasil hui he
 Modi also wants the same
 isi vajah se aresas ne apane pravaktaa ram madhav or uttar pradesh ke sanyojak shiv prakaash ko shah kii team main shaamil karavaaya he
 Also, according to sources, Krishna Gopal is being replaced in place of Suresh Soni to coordinate between the Sangh and the BJP at the national level
 agar ye sabhi netaa shah ke saath talmail se kaam karte hai, jaisaa unhone uttar pradesh main kiya to koi vajah nahin he ki modi or sangh ko apane saz lakshya main kamyaabi nahin milegi

 After the death of Prophet Mohammed, his family and enemies of Islam started becoming stronger

 Then his son-in-law Hazrat Ali was stabbed and killed by a sword
 iske baad ali ke bade bete hasan kii shahadat hui
 The motive was to end the family
 According to Islamic scholars, the enemies wanted to eliminate the entire family of Prophet Mohammed
 ali or unke bade bete hasan kii shahadat ke baad ab dushmano ne chote bete hossain ko nishaanaa bananaa shuru kar diya
 The plot to annihilate the family of Yajid and Hussainpangber left Mecca and Medina and reached Karbala
 yajid (jo ki khud ko khalipha maanata tha) ne hossain par apane mutabik chalane kaa dabaav banaaya
 Ordered Hussain to consider him his Khalifa
 vah chahta tha ki agar hossain use maanane laga to islam par uskaa bolbalaa ho jayega, jise wo apane mutabik chalaa sakegaa
 However, Hussain refused to believe so
 hossain ne yajid ke har ofer ko thukraa diya
 When Hussain reached Karbala, there was a small Lashkar with him
 is kafile main auraton ke alaava chote bachche bhi the
 According to the Islamic calendar, Hussain reached Karbala on the second date of Muharram
 iske baad 7 muharram ko yajid ne hossain ke lashkar kaa pani band kar diya or un par apni baat maanane kaa har mumkin dabaav banaaya
 Hussain knew that Yajid is very powerful
 uskaa lashkar kahin zyada bada he
 They have weapons, daggers, swords
 jabaki unke apane log behad kam sankhya main hai
 Despite this, Hussein remained on the same din, which is the Islam of his maternal grandfather and Prophet Mohammad

 However, he could not shake the spirits of Hussain and his convoy
 muharram kii 9 taarikh ko imam hossain ne saathiyon se kafila chhodkar apni jaan bachaane kii peshkash kii
 Hussain said that tomorrow we have to face enemies and they are very powerful, so i want to happily leave you here
 magar, unke saathiyon main se koi bhi nahin gaya
 On the 10th of Muharram, Yazid's army attacked Hussain's Lashkar on the 10th of Muharram
 is jang main hossain samet 72 logon ko katl kar diya gaya
 Among them, Hussein's 6-month-old son Ali Asgar, 18-year-old Ali Akbar and his 7-year-old nephew Kasim (hasan's son) were also martyred
 hossain ko qatl karne ke baad unke gharon main aag laga di gai
 All the women and children left were tied in a single rope and taken to Yajid's court
 yajid ne sabhi ko apana kaidi banaakar jail main dalava diya
 Muslims believe that Yazid oppressed the people to run Islam in their own way
 yajid ne khalipha banane ke liye islam ke aakhri paigambar mohammad ke navaase hossain ko katl kar diya
 On the 10th of Muharram, Muslims express grief in different ways, remembering the same sacrifice of Hussain
 shiya muslim apana khun bahaakar matam manaate hai, sunni muslim namaaj-roj ke saath ibaadat karte hai

 But amidst all this, the question also arises as to who is the face of the alliance of these two big parties of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav or Mayawati
 gathbandhan ke andruni samikarnon par dhyaan den to choudhary ajit singh tisare bade netaa hai lekin unka aadhaar pashchimi uttar pradesh ke kuch jilon se zyada nahin he
 But SP and BSP have their own vote bank in Uttar Pradesh

 SP and BSP got 22% if they got 6% votes
 vahiin, baat karen loksabhaa chunaav 2014 kii to bijepi ko uttar pradesh main 42
 6% of the votes were received
 sapa ko 22 fisadi or bispi ko 20 fisadi vot mili the lekin bispi ke khate main ek bhi seat nahin ai
 Talk about the experience, BSP Supreme Mayawati has become CM of Uttar Pradesh thrice and she has been a Member of Parliament in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
 vahiin akhilesh yadav bhi uttar pradesh ke siem or loksabhaa saansad rah chuke hai
 Mayawati is the chief of BSP after Kanshi Ram and there is no one to challenge her within the party
 vahiin akhilesh yadav parivaar ke jhagade ke baad mulaayam singh yadav ko hataakar sapa adhyaksh bane hai
 Talking of seats, Samajwadi Party currently has 7 mps in the Lok Sabha and in the same way, in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, Samajwadi Party has 48 mlas in the Assembly and BSP has 19 mlas
 vahiin bispi ke rajyasabha main 4 saansad hai or samaajawaadee party ke 11 saansad hai
 In this regard, the Samajwadi Party is much stronger than the BSP
 akhilesh yadav is samay uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party ko poster bvoy bhi hai
 But the question is whether Mayawati will consider Akhilesh Yadav as her leader, or will Akhilesh Yadav be ready to go two steps further to defeat the BJP at any cost

 com / mroessoamc a post shared by Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on Dec 4, 2018 at 7:12am PSTA post shared by Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on Dec 4, 2018 at 4:36am PST Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has called bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi and RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav a 'darling of the media'
 darasal mujffarpur main 3 march ko maudi or lalu ek hi maidan main raily karnaa chaahate hai
 BJP had announced this earlier
 phir lalu bich main aa gaye or kaha ki sampradayik takaton ko rokane ke liye vah bhi usee din raily karenge
 When asked about the matter, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said, "this is a matter between the 'darlings of the media', in which i have said, i represent the neglected Jamaat
" 'nitish kumaar kii naaraazgi is baat ko lekar he ki bihar main lagaataar sankalp raily karne ke baavjood media main unhen manachaahi kawarej nahin mil rahi
 He held a Sankalp rally in the same ground in Muzaffarpur a few days ago, but Nitish alleges that the media has not shown it and that the rally is going to be made a big issue
 nitish ne yah bhi kaha ki is vivaad se unka lenaa-dena nahin he
 He said, 'this district administration decides and the first one gets the field
 agar isamen koi gadabad hoti he to upar adaalatein bhi hai
 ' notebandi ko ek saal puraa hone ke saath bahes chhidi he ki desh ne kya khoyaa or kya paaya
 The government is not getting tired of stating its decision as 'historic'
 vahiin vipaksh notebandi ko 'sadi kaa sabase bada ghotaalaa' bataate hue 8 november ko 'kaala diwas' manaane kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 In the midst of this debate, there is definitely a front where positive results of demonetisation have been seen
 ye he suraksha kaa front
 The closure of 500 and 1000 rupee notes in demonetisation has severely broken the back of Naxalites, terrorists and hawala traders
 notebandi ne funding kii chen todakar naksaliyon ko kangaal bana diya he
 At the same time, there are reports that the terrorists also became robbers in panic due to the demonetisation of Terror funding and carried out more than a dozen bank robbery incidents
 notebandi kaa acha parinaam ye bhi dekhne ko mila ki kashmir main pichley saal ke mukaable patharbaji kii ghatnaon main kaaphi kami ai he
 According to Home Ministry sources, there were 2800 stone pelting incidents in the Valley last year
 vahiin maujuuda saal main ab tak aisi 600 ghatnaayen hi dekhne ko milin
 Earlier it was seen that whenever a terrorist was killed, incidents of stone pelting increased
 lekin maujuuda saal main ab tak 198 aatankiyon ko suraksha balon ne dher kiya he, phir bhi patharbaji kii ghatnaon main ascharyajanak dhang se kami ai he
 Clearly, demonetisation had a major impact in bringing such a situation
 centre sarkaar kaa daawa he ki queta or karachi main pakistan kii sarkari priting preson main bharat ke nakli karency note chhapane kaa jo napak khel chalata tha, wo notebandi se chaupat ho gaya he
 According to Union Minister of State for Home Hansraj Ahir, the ban on terrorists has been curbed by the ban
 vahiin kashmir main patharbaji kii ghatnaon main bhi kami ai he
 Hansraj Ahir claims that there has been a 25 to 30 percent reduction in terrorist incidents due to demonetisation
 teror funding kii chen tuutane se aatankiyon ke paas paison kaa itnaa tota hua ki kuch aatankwaadi bank lut kii ghatnaon ko hi anjaam dene lage
 According to Union Minister of State for Home Hansraj Ahir, demonetisation also had the effect that Naxalites had to eat food
 naksaliyon ne jo avaidh dhan ikattha kar rakhaa tha wo sab raddi ho gaya
 Security expert PK Sehgal also believes that the entire economic structure of Naxalite organizations has collapsed due to Kinotbandi
 unke paas badi maatra main nakadi thi jo 500 or 1000 ke note band hote hi mitti main mil gai
 During this period, the security forces carried out Operation Prahar and killed the Naxals twice
 1700 naksali pakde gaye or 600 ne sarender kiya
 Meanwhile, 130 Naxalites were killed during an encounter with security forces
 aisi bhi ghatnaayen saamne ain jahaan naksaliyon ne tendu patta or vasuuli se jo paisa jameen main gaad rakhaa tha use jabt kiya gaya
 The debate on the outcome of demonetisation has undoubtedly sparked debate, but this decision has certainly been effective on the fight against Naxalism and terrorism

 The SP-BSP is on the path of alliance once again in the state, forgetting the 23-year-old rivalry to beat Narendra Modi in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 1993 main ram mandir andolan par savaar bijepi ko haraane vaali mulaayam-kanshiram kii jodi kii tarah modi lahar par savaar party ko haraane ke liye akhilesh-mayawati kii jodi ban rahi he
 However, from 1993 to 2019, a lot of water has flowed into the ganges-gomti and Yamuna
 yahi vajah he ki maaya-akhilesh vaale is gathbandhan ke liye 25 saal pehle jaise nattejey doharaana badi chunauti mana ja rahaa he
 In SP-BSP alliance, seat sharing, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati are separating the Congress in alliance with the state
 isaki ghoshnaa shanivaar ko donon netaa apni joint coffrence main kar sakate hai
 The seat sharing formula will also be revealed
 mana ja rahaa he ki sapa 36 or basapa 37 seat par chunaav ladegi
 3 seats can be reserved for RLD while 2 seats can be reserved for parties like Peace Party, Nishad Party
 amethi or raibareli seat par gathbandhan apane ummidavaar nahin utaaregaa
 After the SP-BSP alliance, political pundits are assuming that the road to the state will not be easy for the BJP
 iske liye wo 1993 main sapa-basapa gathbandhan kaa udhaaharan de rahe hai, lekin maujuuda siyaasi maahaul ko agar raajnneetik or jaateey sameekaran ke maddenjar denkhe to 25 saal pehle jaise halaat aaj nahin hai

 aise main jab donon ne haath milaayaa to saamaajik nyaay kii ummid jaagi thi
 As a result, the BJP could not return to power even after the Babri Masjid demolition
 haalanki ye gathbandhan 1995 main tut gaya, jiske baad yadav or daliton ke bich ek gahari khai paidaa ho gai
 The state's caste equation is currently 22 percent Dalit voters, including 14 percent Jatavs and Chamars
 ye basapa kaa sabase majboot vot he
 While the remaining 8 percent of the Dalit voters are 60 castes including Pasi, Dhobi, Khatik Musahar, Koli, Valmiki, Gond, Kharwar
 vahiin, 45 fisadi ke kareeb obisi matadaata hai
 Among them, Yadav is 10 percent, Kurmi 5 percent, Maurya 5 percent, Lodhi 4 percent and Jat 2 percent
 baaki 19 fisadi main gurjar, rajbhar, bind, biaar, mallaah, nishad, chaurasia, prajapati, lohaar, kahaar, kumhaar sahit 100 se zyada upjatiyaan hai
 Around 19 per cent are Muslims
 gaiyr-yadav obisi or gaiyr-jatav dalit bijepi ke sathbijepi upi main apane janaadhar ko badhaane ke liye 2014 or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main gaiyr yadav obisi or gaiyr jatav daliton ko apane saath milaane main kaamyaab rahi he
 As a result, the SP-BSP had become completely corrupt before the BJP, first in the Lok Sabha and then in the Assembly
 obisi chintak rakesh kushvaha kehete hai ki bijepi ne satta main aane ke baad sarkaar main in dalit va obisi jatiyon ko hissedaar bhi banaaya he
 Not only this, BJP is also working on the strategy of dividing 27 per cent reservation for OBC into three categories
 aise main sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke liye sabase badi chunauti in dalit or obisi jatiyon ko apane saath jodne kii hogi
 In fact, the SP BSP has been accused of being a party of Yadavs, Muslims and Jatavs
 jabaki maujuuda raajnneeti main gaiyr-yadav obisi or gaiyr jatav daliton ke andar bhi raajnneetik chetana jaagi he, aise main inhen saadhe bina bijepi ko maat dena akhilesh or mayawati ke liye tedi kheer hoga
 Challenges for SP-BSP: Political analyst Sunil Kumar Suman said that the biggest challenge facing SP-BSP alliance in UP is transfer of votes
 jin siton par samaajawaadee party lard rahi he, vahaan basapa kaa vot to transfar ho saktaa he, lekin jin siton par basapa lard rahi he vahaan sapa ke vot transfar hona mushkil ho saktaa he
 This apprehension is also because if we look at the results of the recent Allahabad University elections, Uday Prakash Yadav won the post of President from the Samajwadi Student Assembly by a large margin, but SP candidate Munesh Kumar Saroj on the post of Vice President not only lost the election by a big margin
 Rather moved to number three
 vahiin, is seat par enesayuai ke akhilesh yadav chunaav jeet hasil kii teesraa sabase bada chalange jin siton par gathbandhan se muslim ummidavaar chunaav ladenge, un siton par sapa or basapa apane votaron ko kaise transfar karaayenge? kyonki muslim bahulya siton par sampradayik dhruvikaran kii zyada sambhaavnaaen rahati hai
 The equation of 2014 is that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, out of 80 parliamentary seats in UP, BJP was able to win 73 seats in the alliance and the remaining 7 seats were won by the opposition
 bijepi ko 71, apana dal ko 2, congress ko 2 or sapa ko 5 siten mili thim
 bsp's account could not be opened
 haalanki soobe kii 3 loksabhaa siton par upachunaav hue hai, jinamein se 2 par sapa or ek par areldi ko jeet mili thi
 In this way, BJP has 68 seats and SP has 7 seats
 samrik morche par china ko chunautiyon se nipatane or kadi takkar dene ke liye bharat ne bada kadam uthaaya he

 com / yxisjtql6o — BCCI (@BCCI) December 18, 2018 During the match, there was a tussle between the two captains, but both said that the boundary was not breached
 australia main rapaton main daawa kiya gaya ki is dauraan kohli ne duniya kaa sarvshereshth ballebaaj hone kii ding bhi maari
 Kohli said after the defeat - no limit was crossed in the second test, the BCCI defended Kohli saying that his quoted statement is not correct and he never claims this way
 bisisiai ne ek bayaan main kaha ,‘aisa samajha ja rahaa he ki kohli ne kaha ,‘ main duniya kaa sarvshereshth khilaadi hum or tum mahaj ek kaaryvahak captain ho 
 'this is heard and the BCCI wants to tell that the Indian captain did not say anything like that on the field
 ’ isamen kaha gaya ,‘bisisiai ko team prabandhan se spashtikaran mila he or ham yah saaf karnaa chaahate hai ki ye sari report bebuniyaad hai

 Actually, in 2014, the court allowed the e-rickshaw to run in Delhi with some instructions
 lekin nirdeshon kaa paalan na hone par court kii avhelnaa ko lekar ek or nai yachika lagaai gai
 While hearing, the court has asked the government how these e-rickshaws are plying on the rest of the roads in the capital
 jin par chalane kii ijaajat sarkaar se mili hi nahin he
 In fact, e-rickshaws were allowed to run in Delhi with some conditions, with the first condition that e-rickshaws would not be run on 236 Road of PWD
 kyonki yahaan par vaahanon kii gati 40 kilometre prati ghante kii hoti he, jabaki i rickshaw ko 25 kilometre prati ghante se zyada raftaar par chalane kii ijaajat nahin he
 That is why e-rickshaws were allowed to walk only on those roads which are MCD roads
 lekin i rickshaw abhi bhi dhadlle se PWD kii sadakon par chal rahe hai, jiske chalate trephic jam kii samasya dilli main aam ho gai
 There are currently over two lakh e-rickshaws in Delhi
 lekin registration sirf 50,000 kaa hi he
 The High Court wants these 1
5 lakh e-rickshaws to be either challaned or regularized and at the same time they should be allowed to walk only on the road which belongs to MCD
 iske alaava i-rickshaw chalaane vaale drivers aksar trephic niyamon ko todate hue najar aate hai

 jisase aksar kai baar durghatnaayen dekhne ko mili hai
 The High Court has specifically instructed the traffic police to take strict action against the drivers who do not follow the rules

 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Yogendra Yadav said on Wednesday that his party has neither alliances, coordination or agreement with the Congress
 unhone kaha ki yadi aap ko apane muddon par samarthan nahin milegaa to vah satta se baahar ho jaaegi
 Yogendra told reporters, "we have always made it clear that we do not have any alliance with the Congress party, there is no coordination nor any consensus
" aise main hamaare paas na to koi adhikaar he or na javabdehi hi or hamen yah bhi nahin kahana he ki unhen kya karnaa chahie or kya nahin karnaa chahie
 Yogendra said, they are an independent mature political party, so it is their own decision
 main rekhaankit karnaa chaahunga ki hamaare paas sankhya bal he or ham apana agenda kriyanvit karne ja rahe hai
 It is noteworthy that AAP has won 28 seats in the 70-member Delhi Assembly and the party is going to form the government with the support of Congress
 congress ko chunaav main aath siton par jeet hasil hui he
 Although the BJP has got the maximum 31 seats, but due to being away from the majority, it decided not to form the government
 yogendra ne kaha ki ve 18 muddon or 28 vidhayakon ke saath vidhansabha main jaaenge or samarthan hasil karne kii koshish karenge
 He said, we will hope and hope that due to the nature of the issues we will get support
 yadi hamen samarthan nahin miltaa he to ham baahar aa jaaenge
 For Jharkhand, the Congress is preparing for its strategy, and if Congress sources are to be believed, the party wants to adopt the Bihar model in Jharkhand as well, i
e
 a grand alliance will be formed there too, but here the road is not as easy as Bihar
 bihar main lalu prasad yadav or nitish kumaar ko loksabhaa chunaav ke turant baad yah andaja ho gaya tha ki yadi bihar kii raajnneeti main vajood bachaae rakhana he to milanaa hi padegaa, or phir apane tamaam rajnatik ahankaar ko taak par rakhkar lalu or nitish saath aa gaye, or saath main aae congress-ensipi bhi
 But the problem in Jharkhand is that the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha has decided to contest the elections alone
 darasal jhamumo ko loksabhaa chunaav se koi fark nahin padataa, or vah apana dhyaan vidhansabha chunaav par focus karnaa chaahati he
 However, JMM has two seats in the Lok Sabha
 jharkhand main bijepi se takkar lene ke liye jharkhand mukti morcha ke bina koi kargar gathbandhan nahin ban saktaa
 The Congress knows this, so an attempt is being made to convince Hemant Soren
 doosraa vikalp he ki babulal marandi ko manaaya jaae, magar vahaan dikkat he ki marandi haal ke dinon main rajnatik rup se kaaphi kamjor hue hai or unki party ke netaa yaa to bijepi main chale gaye hai yaa congress main
 Secondly, Marandi wants most of the assembly seats in the alliance
 jharkhand vidhansabha kii abhi jo haalat he, uske mutabik congress ke paas 14, jhamumo ke paas 18, argedy ke paas paanch or jediu ke paas chaar siten hai, jabaki babulal marandi ke paas 11 siten hai
 In such a situation, sharing of seats is a difficult task
 sabhi party apni aukaat se adhik siton par ladanaa chaahati hai
 If Congress sources are to be believed, the party has focused its attention on the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, but the problem is that the RJD supremo is undergoing treatment in Mumbai, and without Lalu Yadav, the alliance is not moving forward
 vaise saidhantik taur par congress, lalu or nitish is baat par taiyaar hai ki bihar kii tarj par jharkhand main bhi saath chunaav ladaa jaae
 Assembly elections are due in late December in Jharkhand, and now the entire Daromdar is on JMM
 baaki dal hemanth sorain ko yah samajhane main jute hai ki saath chunaav ladane se hi bijepi ko roka ja saktaa he, varanaa sabhi dalon kaa patta saaf ho saktaa he
 For this, the JMM, being a big party, can lead this alliance, while the Chief Ministerial candidate will be discussed after the election
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki chunaav main hemanth sorain ke kaarykaal main hue kaamkaaj par hi vot maanga jayega
 During the recent Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting, Chief Minister Hemant Soren's hooting has forced all the anti-bjp parties to come together, as well as a reason for raising the issue of Jharkhand's identity in these parties

 He was contesting elections on the basis of issues and wanted to gain from this

 On Friday, Rahul asked the PM his 10th question
 rahul ne is sawaal main adivaasiyon kii jameen kaa mudda uthaaya
 Rahul fired 55 thousand crore rupees under the Vanbandhu scheme, where did the money go when the youth did not get employment and the poor got homes
 bataa den ki rahul gandhi aaj se paanch din ke gujarat daure par hai
 Rahul tweeted, "land taken away from tribal, rights not given on forest, millions of land leased, school not found, hospital not found, home to homeless, employment to youth, migration gives break to tribal society, Modiji, Where did the 55,000 crores of Vanbandhu scheme go? 22 years accounted for # gujarat_mange_jawab 10th question: Land not taken away from tribal, rights on forest are lying
 Homeless, not home to youth, employment has been given to demolition of tribal society, where did the Vanbandhu scheme worth 55 thousand crores? - Office of RG (@officeofrg) December 8, 2017 ) Let us know that Rahul has asked nine questions so far
 guuruuvaar ko apane nauven sawaal main rahul ne gujarat main karj maafee, fasal ke daam or fasal beemaa kii raashi par sawaal uthaae the
 Rahul tweeted, "neither loan waiver, nor the right price for the crop, crop insurance amount not received, no tubewell arrangement, Gabbar Singh's hit on farming, stripped land, Annadata was wasted, PM tell, Why so much treatment with Khedut? ”on eighth malnutrition, Sawalrahul questioned the issues of malnutrition in Gujarat from PM on Wednesday

 He had said that the infidelity of the jumlas was killed, the demonetisation was looted, the GST killed all the earnings, the rest was left and inflation was killed

 Rahul had questioned the BJP, which held power in Gujarat for 22 years, questioning PM Modi
 rahul ne twit karte hue likhaa, 'na suraksha, na shiksha, na poshan, mahilaon ko mila to sirf shoshan, anganwari varkar or aashaa, sabko di bas niraashaa, gujarat kii bahanon se kiya sirf vaada, puraa karne kaa kabhi nahin tha iraadaa'
 With this question, Rahul has also written the answer to the hashtag Gujarat
 shiksha par maanga jawaab (chauthaa sawaal ) # gujarat_maange_javabake saath rahul gandhi ne subah apana chauthaa sawaal twit kiya
 In this tweet, he wrote with the title 'prime Minister- Fourth question', 'at the cost of government school-college, did business of education, hit every student with expensive fees, how will the dream of New India come true?' Tanja (third question) Rahul's third question is related to power supply in Gujarat
 rahul ne twit kar modi se poocha ki 2002-16 ke bich 62 hajaar 549 karod kii bijli kharid kar 4 nijee companiyon kii jeb kyon bhari? saath hirahul gandhi ne gujarat sarkaarper sarkari bijli kaarkaanon kii kshamta ghataane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Rahul said that the capacity of the government power plants was reduced by 62 percent but why did he buy electricity from a private company for Rs 3 per unit for Rs 24? Targeting the loan (second question) Rahul's second question was that in 1995, Gujarat was paid Rs 9,183 crore
 There was debt and in 2017, Gujarat has a debt of 2,41,000 crore
 yani har gujarati par 37 hajaar rupee kaa karj he
 Keeping these figures in front, Rahul Gandhi has asked why the people of Gujarat should pay the sentence of Narendra Modi's financial mismanagement and publicity? Started from the house (first question) On November 29, Rahul started his questions
 congress upaadhyaksh ne twit karte hue pehla sawaal poocha, '22 saalon kaa hisaab, gujarat maange jawaab, gujarat ke halaat par pradhanmantriji se pehla sawaal: 2012 main vaada kiya ki 50 lakh nae ghar denge, 5 saal main banaae 4
 72 lakh houses
 pradhanmantriji bataaie ki kya ye vaada puraa hone main 45 saal or lagenge'
 Rahul Gandhi is reminiscent of the election promises made by the BJP in the last election
