 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar met Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Thursday after the Congress's weak performance in states like UP in the recent assembly elections
 sonia gandhi abhi apane medical upachaar ke baad america se lauti hai or unke dilli sthit awaas par donon netaaon kii mulaakaat hui
 In this case, JDU of Nitish Kumar's party said that it was a long pending courtesy call
 lekin sutara is mulaakaat ko jadyu mukhiya kii bijepi ke khilaaf 2019 ke aam chunaavon main 'mahagathbandhan' ke prayaason kii kadi main dekh rahe hai
 It is worth mentioning that JDU, RJD and Congress under the leadership of Nitish Kumar defeated the BJP in the Bihar Assembly elections by forming a grand alliance
 ab rashtriya str par 'mahagathbandhan' kii is tarah kii sugabugahat dalon ke bheetar uthne lagi he
 Nitish's meeting with Sonia is also being seen in this context
 vaise bhi nitish kumaar rashtriya str par piem narendra modi se muqabla karne ke liye dharmanirpeksh dalon ke mahagathbandhan ke liye aahvaan karte rahe hai, jaisaa ki bihar chunaav se pehle kiya gaya tha
 After the defeat of BJP, the Congress is doing 'introspection' at this time
 isi kadi main sutron ke mutabik nitish kumaar ne sonia gandhi ko salaah dete hue kaha, ''narendra modi par pratikriya dene ke bajaay ham logon ko apana agenda khud tay karnaa chahie
 Nitish Kumar has already given similar advice to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi

 Casey Tyagi said, "being the leader of the largest opposition party, Sonia Gandhi should take the lead on this issue
" '' kasee tyaagi ne yah bhi kaha ki nitish kumaar ne vam dalon se bhi is masale par charchaa kii he or unako sakaaratmak rispance mila he
 Anyway, Nitish Kumar has been calling for a grand alliance of secular parties to compete against PM Narendra Modi at the national level, as it was done before the Bihar elections
 bijepi se haar ke baad vaise bhi congress is vakt 'aatmamanthan' kar rahi he
 According to sources in this link, Nitish Kumar while advising Sonia Gandhi said, "instead of reacting to Narendra Modi, we should decide our own agenda
 '' kamobesh aisi hi salaah congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ko bhi nitish kumaar de chuke hai
 The comments ullekhneey he ki sonia gandhi swasthya kaarnon se haalia daur main saarvajanik rup se zyada sakriy nahin dikhaai di hai

 In this regard, JDU leader KC Tyagi said that the two leaders also discussed the possibilities of a common candidate from the opposition for the post of President
 kasee tyaagi ne kaha, ''sabase badi vipakshi party kii netaa hone ke kaaran sonia gandhi ko is masale par aguai kerani chahie
 KC Tyagi also said that Nitish Kumar has discussed this issue with the Left parties too and has received positive response

 However, the noise of opposition members continued

 Meanwhile, a situation of chaos ensued in the House when a person tried to jump down from the spectator gallery immediately after the adjournment of the House, but the vigilant security personnel caught him and controlled him

 harivansh raay bachchan (harivansh Rai Bachchan) kaa janm 27 november 1907 ko uttar pradesh ke pratapgarh jile ke babupattee gaanv main hua tha
 Born in the Srivastava Kayastha family, Harivansh Rai was called Bachchan in childhood, which he later added to his name
 unhone apni shuruaati padhai urdu main kii or phir unhone elahabaad vishvavidhyalay se angrezi main em
 a
 kiya
 Bachchan, a professor in the English Department of the University of Allahabad for many years, completed his phd by researching the poems of English poet WB Yeats from the University of Cambridge
 vah akashwani se jude rahe or ek hindi visheshgy ke rup main unhone videsh mantralay ke saath bhi kaam kiya
 Harivansh Rai Bachchan made a unique contribution to Hindi literature
 1935 main chhapi 'madhushaala' ke liye bachchan sahab ko aaj bhi yaad kiya jaataa he
 'madhushala' is one of the works of Harivansh ji that gave him a different identity in the literary world
 'madhushaala', 'madhubala' or 'madhukalash'- ek ke baad ek teen sangrah sheeghra aae jinhen 'halawaad' kaa pratinidhigranth kaha ja saktaa he
 Harivansh Rai Bachchan wrote 4 autobiographies
 kaha jaataa he ki unke alaava apane bare main sab kuch itani bebaaki or saahas ke saath kisi ne nahin likhaa
 His first autobiography was 'kya Bhooloon, Kya Yaad Karoon'
 kehane ko to ye ek aatmakatha thi lekin isamen us samay ke bharat main rahane vaale logon ke bare main bahut kuch he
 At that time, how people used to have relationships between them, all these things are understood in their autism
 bachchan kii duusari aatmakatha 'need kaa nirmaan phir', teesri aatmakatha 'basere se dur' or chauthi'dashadwar se sopan' he
 His work Do Chattaane was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award for Hindi Poetry in 1968
 isi varsh unhen soviet land nehru puraskaar or effro asian sammelan ke camel puraskaar se bhi sammanit kiya gaya
 Bachchan was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1976 in the field of literature and education by the Government of India

 Speaking at the ceremony related to the establishment of the Reserve Battalion of the force, Chidambaram said that the demand has increased after the government agreed to provide CISF protection to private companies too
 unhone kaha ki nijee sansthaanon ke khataron ko dekhte hue ‘hamen or javaanon kii bhartee kerani hogi or ikai ko majboot karnaa hoga
 Chidambaram said that just establishing infrastructure and industry is not enough
 unhen surakshit rakhe jane kii aavashyaktaa he
 Only then the country's economy will be sustained
 unhone yuvaaon se bal main shaamil hone kaa aahvaan karte hue kaha ki tamilnadu main batalian sthapit kiye jane se shivganga ke aarthik vikaas main bhi madad milegi
 Sivaganga is also his home district

 kul milakar kavita, sahitya, pathan-pathan main dilchaspee rakhane waalon ke liye yahaan bahut kuch hoga
 The entire schedule is like this
 mangalvaar ko manipur main congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne east imphal main raily ko sambodhit kiya
 Rahul fiercely attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the rally, Rahul said that PM showed Dilwale Dulhania to be taken in 2014 but later Gabbar Singh came out
 manipur main 4 or 8 march ko matdaan hoga
 Rahul Gandhi said in Imphal - The people of Manipur have given a lot to the world, people here respect nature
 - manipur: rahul gandhi bole - america main bhi maid in manipur kii shawl bike- chun-chun kar yuvaaon ko dhundhakar sahaayta karenge- piem ne sports uniwarsity kaa vaada nahin nibhaayaa- piem baaten bahut karte hai, teen saal se neshnal hive taiyaar nahin hua, 100 din kii baat hui thi
 Manipur is a model of prepaid electricity, it was praised all over the world
 isse piem modi ke dimag main kanfusion aayaa
 a few months ago, Soniaji called me and said that for the first time PM Modi called me and said that i have done historical work and said that we have made a Naga record
 - lekin is bare main rajya ke mukhyamantri ko nahin bataaya, yahaan tak ke piem modi ke mantriyon ko bhi nahin pataa tha
 But nobody came to know about this decision
 -2014 main piem modi ne sabhi achche din kii dil vaale dulhaniya pikchar dikhaai, lekin baad main gabbar singh kii nikal kar aayaa
 In 2014, PM Modi showed all the good-hearted Dulhania pictures, but later came out of Gabbar Singh
 - ek din ek idia aayaa or 500-1000 ke note band kar diye or hans die ha
 
 ha
 
 ha
 
 - sona, swiss bank ke peeche nahin gayi lekin aam aadmi ko line main laga diya
 No rich stood in the lines outside the bank
 - 22 november 2014 ko sahaara par red hui, inakam tex ne kaagajon main ai entry main 30 oktober ko 2 karod rupee diye
 After this, the name of Gujarat CM also came on Birla's papers, and PM Modi questions Ibobi Singh
 lekin inke khilaaf ek bhi saboot nahin he
 15 lakh rupees, talked about sports university but got nothing, PM Modi spreads hatred wherever he goes, makes false promises
 - main chahta hum ki aane vaale samay main olympic main manipur 5 medal laaye
 - The ideology of Nagpur cannot run this state, only the ideology of Manipur will run here
 - piem agali baar yahaan aayen to unase ek sawaal poochna ki manipur ke liye aapane kya kiya
 The billboards on the flyovers of Rajdhani are also very similar to those of diamonds which carry the famous models shown on them
 har 100 meter par ek nayaa billboard namoodaar ho jaataa he—chamakdaar, khubasurat, daulatmand or us jivan style ko bayaan karata hua, jise brands ke sansthaapak neerav modi ne itani jaddojahad se kharidaaron ke gale utaarne kii koshish kii thi
 Just a short distance from there, a group of alsubh phool rosas go to work in the service lane behind the brand's flagship store in Defense Colony, South Delhi
 ve sabase khubasurat taaja phulon se manamohak sajaavatein taiyaar karte hai taaki unase store ko sajaayaa ja sake
 It was the first store that Modi established when he launched his jewelery brand in 2010 and was also designed by Spanish architect Jaime Hayon
 oonche or rasukhdaar graahakon ke liye nijee pradarshan kaksh se sajaa yah store dekhte hi dekhte tamaam storon ke liye maanak ban gaya
 Who is Nirav Modi? If you ask any person in the jewelery business, they will tell you that it takes decades to establish a trustworthy brand and even more to build a brand that has built its reputation around the world
 diamond or aabhushanon ke kaarobaar main zyaadaatar log aam taur par shoharat or dhoomdhaam se bachakar chalate hai or is lihaaj se modi bhi alahada nahin tha
 Whenever he was interviewed, he soon removed the conversation from himself and brought him to his designs and the brand he had created
 usne apni piaar mashinari or marketing ko apni chhavi is tarah banane diya jisase keval sabase awwal patrikaon kii hi pahunch us tak ho or yah pakkaa karne ko kaha ki uske utpaada ek panne par akele or alahada dikhaae jaaen, na ki duusare brands kii bheedbhad ke bich (duniya bhar ke sabase bade fishan brands bhi aisa hi karte hai)
 The last 20-year-old blueprint was drawn, in which Modi planned his success and worked continuously to get there
 47 varshiya modi vah shaks he jo apane pita se kahaniyaan sunate hue bhadkile gahanon or hiron ke bich bada hua
 He used to wear ornaments and ornaments like night and day
 uske pita deepak modi saath ke dashak main belgium ke entwarp chale gaye the
 Deepak's jeweler father also brought Deepak into this business and settled in Mumbai to Singapore in the forties
 ve hindustan ke graahakon ko kachche heere bechate the or taumr hiron ke vyapaaree hi bane rahe—khudara bazaar main utarane kii unki na ichha thi or na yojana
 The third generation Nirav is a connoisseur and businessman of diamonds
 vah palanpur kaa jain he
 He created a glittering empire like other Jains of this region of Gujarat
 entwarp main palanpur ke 400 se zyada parivaar hai or sabhi hiron kaa dhandha karte hai
 He has left behind Jews initially at the center of this business
 neerav kii paidaaish hindustan main gujarati mata-pita ke yahaan hui, vah entwarp main palaa-badha or apane bachapan kaa bada hissaa mujic conductor banane kii ichha ke saath bitaayaa
 These plans were however disallowed when he decided that he would study Japanese and finance from Wharton
 mahaj saal bhar baad usne ise bhi chhodie kaa faisla kiya
 He moved to Mumbai at the age of 19
 paariwarik kaarobaar main uski diksha mamaa mehul chaukasee kii chhatrachhaaya main shuru hui, jo gitanjali james kaa agua tha
 He acquired this company in 1985 from his father
 chaukasee ko laga ki agar usne apana kaarobaar badhanaa he to branded diamond julri ke kahin zyada bade portpholio kii darkaar hogi, jise vah duniya bhar ke khudara bazaaron main bech sake
 He launched Gili, Nakshatra, De Dumas, Sangini and other co-brands and sold them at over 4,000 sales outlets spread across the country
 gitanjali james main modi ne nau saal bitaye or yaheen usne apane kaarobaar ke daanvpech siikhe
 "he was a perfectionist, an always moving forward," says a man who has worked closely with him over the years
 yahaan tak ki haath main liya hua kaam puraa hone se pehle hi ve agle kadam kii ranneeti bananaa shuru kar dete the
 He dreamed big
 '' modi ne 2004 main firestar international launch kiya, jo duniya bhar ke behtareen heere khojkar laata or unka vyapaar karata tha
 Vigil became a partner in the company with a total value of 2
 3 arab dollar bataaya jaataa he
 The design and launch of the Nirav Modi brand was a mere coincidence
 india today ko die pehle ke ek intervyuu main usne kaha tha, ''main diamond julri ke kaarobaar main aana chahta tha, main ek aisi jagah hona chahta tha jahaan yah cheez bas shuru hi hone vaali thi
 Modi started designing at the behest of a friend, whom he had met suddenly at a party
 is dost ne usase jor dekar kaha ki vah unke liye kaanon kii bali kaa joda dizin kar den
 He refused
 ve adi raheen or yahaan tak ki mumbai ke prasad chambers main uske dakratar main aa dhamkeen
 He finally agreed to the design ahead of his insistence
 ek maheene baad jab ve uski dizin kii hui kaanon kii baaliyaan dekhne ain, to khushi se uchhal padin
 Modi had said, "seeing his reaction, i realized that it would be wonderful to bring that kind of happiness in someone's life
" ''usne khud apane naam par brands kii sthapana 2010 main kii or raturaat julri ke superstar ban gaya
 In a market where hundreds of jewelery brands were present, it looked different for three reasons
 ek, uske dizin, jo sambhraant, aatmavishvaas se labarej, chaundhiyane vaale, antarrashtriya or aaraamdeh the or behtareen hiron se banaae gaye hote the
 Two, his personality — every person he meets says that he is an affectionate and soft-spoken person
 teen, ghaagh kaarobaari, jo kaarobaar ke maukon ko tadta tha or peeche mudakar dekhne par, shaayad bagaiyr zyada soche-vichaare un par kaam karne main jute jaataa tha
 Once asked what luxury meant to him, he said, "luxury means more than complete
" yah vah filter he jiske aarpaar main dizin ke lakshya yani rachanaatmakataa, kalaatmakataa or aaraam dekhtaa hum
 Luxury is simple, but arousing emotion
 yah sabase khalis or bemisaal hiron se taraashi gai moulik utkrushtataa or baarik shilpkaaree he
 In 2010, while he was making jewelery, his raw designs caught the eye of the jewelery chief of auction house Christies
 christies kii 2010 kii nilaamee ke liye uske golconda lotus necoles ko chunaa gaya or ise unhone apane katalog ke mukhaprishth par jagah di—aisa pehle kabhi nahin hua tha or modi is sammaan se nawaja gaya pehla hindustani ban gaya
 He then patented three unique patterns of diamonds — one in which a diamond aura was created, the other, in which diamonds worked as rings, and a third, in which diamonds were made of petals
 usne ek samrajya bananaa shuru kiya jo sabhi mahadwipon main failaa tha—yah koi aasaan kamyaabi nahin thi, khaskar us vakt jab koi bhi doosraa hindustani julri brands duniya bhar main apane pair pasaarne main kaamyaab nahin hua tha
 Modi used to take care of every detail of his brand
 usne kaha tha, ''kaarobaar kaa harek pahalu—digining, production or unka vyapaarik pradarshan in-house hi kiya jaataa he kyonki main gunvattta par puraa niyantran chahta hum
 "her personal life has never been in the public domain
" patni 42 varshiya emi modi kii parvarish neuyork main hui thi or uske saath shaadi ke baad ve mumbai aa gayi or hameshaa uske saath khadi raheen
 According to a man he frequently meets with the Modi family, he was deeply rooted in Mumbai's high and affluent society, but remained far from dazzled at the top
 uske bhai nishal modi ne ishita saalganvkar se shaadi kii, jo anil or mukesh ambani kii bhanji hai
 Nirav and his wife are also said to be close to the Ruia family (essar group)
 unke teenon bacchon kii padhai-likhaai mumbai ke usee dhirubhai ambani skool se hui jahaan kai udyogpatiyon or sitaron ke bachche padhate hai
 However, last year, he was removed from this school to a school in New York
 yah shaayad is baat kaa ishaara tha ki modi ko chizon ke nirnaayak mukaam tak pahunchane kaa ehsaas ho gaya tha or vah apane parivaar ko mumbai se dur surakshit ilaake main le janaa chahta tha
 Brand Nirav Modi's specialty of his jewelery was that he used the finest type of diamonds, he had amazing beauty and metal was used less and less
 iske alaava modi kaa jor is baat par hota tha ki uske aabhushan puri tarah aaramdaayak hon
 His factory head Peter Mazur recounts an incident in which Modi presented a woman with an ornament worn throughout the day which was brought to her for approval
 vah jaananaa chahta tha ki use pahanakar apana kaam karte hue us mahila ko kisi tarah kii dikkat to nahin mahasoos hui
 Modi does not know how to draw, despite the aesthetic sense
 phir vah kisi vijual sandarbh ke bina dizin kaise karata tha?ek baar india today ko die gaye apane intervyuu main usne bataaya tha, ''main apni baat bahut spasht or vistaar se rakhata hum, or meri dizin team ke zyaadaatar log lambey samay se mere saath kaam karne ke kaaran meri baat puri hone se pehle hi samaj jate hai
 "as far as inspiration is concerned, there have been many sources for it — the vistas seen in the voyages, attachment to art and poetry, even abstract sources like philosophical thought
" masalan, ek baar usne apni team se camel ke phulon kaa aisa collection dizin karne ko kaha tha jo monet kii painting main lily kii tarah lage
 "I told my team that just as there is no flaw in Michelangelo's idol David, there should be no shortage in our jewelery
" agar hamase koi kami rah jaati he to use puri tarah bigaadkar dobaaraa banaate hai
 "he once said," i have been lucky that since childhood i have had the opportunity to see great things, such as art and architecture — from 16th-century Rubens paintings to modern-day fashion designers such as Antique Six Some of the best architecture of the period
 in sab se mujhe bahut prerana mili jiske chalate maine duniya bhar kii yatraaen kii hai or in yatraaon se bhi mujhe bahut kuch seekhney ko mila
 "stars of Saathmodi" opened their first store in Defense Colony in New Delhi in 2014 and their empire grew rapidly with a grand store in Madison Square, New York, four stores in Hong Kong, one store in Macau (more recently ), Which in 2017 included a store in London's Old Bond Street
 is tarah mahaj paanch saal main dilli, mumbai, honkong, macau, neuyork, landan, beijing, singapore, las vegas or hawaii main 14 store khul gaye
 Modi said, "we are planning to open 100 stores worldwide by 2025
 '' uskaa brands bharat kaa ekmaatr aisa brands he jo duniya ke nami brandon jaise kartie, vine clif and arpells or harry winston se barabari karata he
 She exhibited her jewelery at the 2016 Binel des Antiquières art fair in Paris
 uski badhati prasiddhi kaa pramaan isi se pataa chalata he ki amir or mashhoor log bade-bade aayojanon par uske aabhushan pahanane lage the
 Hollywood actress Kate Winslet wore her jewelery at the 2016 Oscar Awards
 iske alaava dakota johnson, neomi wats, cocao rochaa or taraji pi
 Henson also enhanced the elegance of her jewelery
 kai antarrashtriya modelon ne neerav ke gahanon kaa vigyaapan kiya he jinamein roji hantington-whitale bhi shaamil hai jinhone 2017 main medisson avenue main modi kaa store khole jane ke avasar par in aabhushanon ko pahana tha
 Her jewelry was advertised by model Lisa Hayden, a fine blend of west and east
 2017 main priyanka chopad uski brands ambesder bani thim or bilbordon or televijan par uske aabhushanon main saji-sanwari najar aati thim
 He was accompanied by actor Siddharth Malhotra
 bataaya jaataa he ki shiron stone mumbai main modi ke studio aa chuki thim or bollywood kii kai abhinetriyaan uski niyamit graahak thim
 Given his fame, it was no surprise that in 2017 he was invited to meet the Prince of Wales in Delhi
 seva kaa starmodi ek alag str banaae rakhane par bahut jor dete tha
 You can visit any of their stores in Mumbai, New York or Hong Kong, where its staff is local, but you will get the same experience
 jab pehla store khulaa to modi ne kaha tha, ''agar aapako chocolate pasand he to aapako behtareen kism kaa chocolate pesh kiya jayega, chaahe aap graahak hon yaa na hon
 Out of 300 varieties of tea you will be given the tea of your choice and each tea will have a different way of making
 ''modi ko is baat se koi dikkat nahin thi ki puraa din landan main kaam karne ke baad vah kiraaye kii motorbike par savaar hokar paris main dinar kii meeting main pahunchataa tha
 a motorbike enthusiast, Modi loved to drive the bike on the fast lane, be it on the road or real life
 lekin lagata he, rakrataar kaa yahi shauk use kaaphi mahangaa pad gaya
 According to a consultant of luxury brand, "nirav Modi's dream was to become the Karthi of India
" lekin is tarah kaa vivaad uske brands ke liye vinaashkari hoga
 He has to save his credibility
 kisi bhi lagjri brands ke liye saakh or vishuddhta do sabase mahatvapurn baaten hoti hai

 AAP ke 'mafalaraman' arvind kejarivalkai dinon se twitor par chhaae hue hai to BJP ne bhi apane kaaryakartaaon ko soshal media par sakriyata badhaane ke nirdesh die hai

 All the posts and events of the Delhi BJP Facebook page have to be liked and shared immediately by all the activists as well as retweet the Delhi bjp's tweets
 sabhi sakriy kaaryakarta pradesh karyaalay dwaara die gaye sandesh ko kam se kam 5 whatsapp group, 1 telegram group or 1 hike group main turant share karenge
 The BJP knows that the entire country was easily connected to the Modi wave because of the campaign on social media

 That he alone could not change the decision of the cabinet
 khurshid ne kaha, ‘chidambaram cabinet ke faisle ke baad bhi nilaamee par jor dete rahe

 Khurshid said, 'what we did, we decided thoughtfully, not Raja or Chidambaram, but the cabinet decided to continue with the 2003 cabinet decision thoughtfully
 ’ unhone 25 march ke note ke bare main kaha ki note main jo nishkarsh hai usamen vibhinn mantralayon ke adhikariyon kaa najariya nahin parilakshith hota

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made three major appointments in the last ten days
 ek sibiai nideshak ke pad par anil sinha, ibi chif ke pad par dineshwar sharma or espiji pramukh ke post par vivek shrivastav
 While Anil Sinha is a Bihar cadre police officer, Dineshwar Sharma of Kerala cadre and Vivek Gujarat cadre, but there is a commonality among these three officers and that is the ancestral state of Bihar
 dineshwar sharma ne haalanki kabhi bihar main kaam nahin kiya
 He is considered close to NSA Ajit Doval
 unki kaaryastylee bhi bahut had tak dobhaal ke sutara or siddhant par hi chalati he
 At the same time, Anil Sinha is certain that Modi will take care of all the interests of the government and will not repeat the mistakes of his former boss Ranjit Sinha as long as he holds the post of CBI director
 lekin piem modi dwaara espiji nideshak ke pad par vivek shrivastav kii niyukti ko lekar logon ke man main sabase zyada sawaal khadaa ho rahaa he, kyonki vivek 89 batch ke adhikari hai or anubhav ke maamle main unke paas utana anubhav nahin
 According to experts, Kendra Sircar has preferred the experience and performance of officers in recent times more than batch, where Vivek prevailed over all its shortlisted other officers
 darasal vivek diaiji ke taur par naa keval espiji main paanch saal kaam kar chuke the, balki haal ke varshon main ibi ke bihar- jharkhand ke joint director ke taur par unhone indian mujahidin ke sabase bade antkavaadi yaccin bhatkal ko giraftaar karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Apart from this, he also said that the Indian Mujahideen has a hand in the Bodh Gaya Blast and had already alerted the state government about the possibility of a bomb blast at Narendra Modi's Patna rally last year
 bam visphot ke baad chah maheene ke bheetar hi enie ke saath milakar unhone indian muzahidin se jude kai aropiyon ko giraftaar karne main kaaphi ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Modi also knows that when Vivek was posted in Gujarat, he had no hesitation in arresting the BJP Parliament during a bandh, so Modi, who is aware of many types of throats on himself, knows that such a situation i may not find a better officer than Vivek, who might not hesitate to ignore his words in the matter of security
 bihar ke darunda se nirdaleey ummidavaar ko mili jitsansad kavita singh ke pati ajay singh jediu se the ummidavaarharyana or maharashtra ke vidhansabha ke saath hi bihar main 5 siton par hue upachunaav ke nattejey bhi aa gaye hai
 Among these five assembly seats, AIMIM candidates won in one seat, RJD in two seats and Independent candidates in one seat
 haalanki inamen se ek aisi bhi vidhansabha seat he jisane patna se lekar dilli tak ke bijepi alaakaman ko bhi sochane par majaboor kar diya he
 Which seat is the seat named Daronda
 yah vidhansabha bihar ke charchit jila siwan sansadeey kshetra main aata he
 Actually, jdu's Ajay Singh was in the fray from the NDA alliance on this assembly seat
 vahiin rajd ne umesh singh ko ummidavaar banaaya tha
 But defeating these two, Independent candidate Karanjit alias Vyas Singh won the contest
 nirdaleey chunaav jeetne vaale vyas singh bijepi ke baagi netaa hai
 Former BJP MP also opposes
 It is a matter of fact that Vyas Singh also had the support of former BJP MP Om Prakash Yadav
 unhone khulkar nirdaleey vyas singh ke liye prachaar kiya or jediu ke ajay singh ko haraane kii apil kii
 Please tell here that Omprakash Yadav is the biggest leader of BJP in Siwan
 darunda main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bijepi or jediu kii foot saamne aa gai thi
 Several other BJP leaders, including former MP Om Prakash Yadav, were openly opposing JDU candidate Ajay Singh
 bijepi or jediu ke netaaon ke bich jamkar tu-tu, main-main bhi hui
 Local BJP leaders said that Ajay Singh is of criminal image and JDU is not following the religion of NDA alliance
 bijepi alaakaman par lage aropabijepi ke kai sthaneey netaaon ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki party alaakaman jediu ke aage natmastak ho gai he
 At the same time, among the big leaders of Bihar BJP, Sushil Modi and Mangal Pandey campaigned for Ajay Singh
 yahi nahin, bijepi ke baagi ummidavaar vyas singh ko party se nikaal bhi diya gaya
 Earlier, Sushil Modi, who reached Daronda on the last day of the election campaign, had given a strong warning from the platform that if Vyas Singh did not withdraw the nomination, he would punish him severely
 bijepi alaakaman kii sakhti ke baad bhi party ke sthaneey netaaon kaa virodh jari rahaa
 As a result, Vyas Singh won, while JDU candidate Ajay Singh lost
 susheel modi ke badale surkun he ajay singhjay singh siwan jediu ke sabase bade netaa hai
 Along with this, she is also the husband of current MP of Siwan Kavita Singh
 ajay singh kii maa jagamaato devi bhi lambey samay tak vidhayak raheen
 The by-election was held in Daronda seat after the death of Jagamato Devi in 2011
 tab jadyu ne ajay singh ko tikat nahin diya tha kyonki unpar kai aapraadhik maamle darj the
 After this, Ajay Singh married Kavita Singh in patriarchy and the party fielded him in the electoral arena
 2015 vidhansabha chunaav main bhi kavita singh ko jeet mili
 After the MLA, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Kavita Singh came on the JDU ticket
 yahaan bhi unhone jeet hasil kii
 After this, Kavita Singh resigned from the membership of the Legislative Assembly
 isi vajah se yah seat khaali hui thi
 The Supreme Court denied Asaram Bapu bail on comedical grounds, saying no special concession could be granted to him
 court ne ames main unka medical test karne kaa nirdesh diya he
 a division bench headed by Justice Tirath Singh Thakur refused to give any order to bring 76-year-old Asaram from Jodhpur jail to Delhi, saying that the state government would have to take a decision in this regard
 asaram ke vakilne jab apane muvakkil kii jamaanat yachika par jald sunwaayee kaa aagrah kiya to jajon ne kaha, ‘kya kaidiyon ke liye alag alag aadhaar ho sakate hai? pehle aapaki medical report aane dijie
 It is an aging problem rather than a medical problem
 ’nyaayalay ne kaha ki sheetakaaleen avkaash ke baad janvari main unki yachika par sunwaayee kii jaaegi
 The Supreme Court on October 15 directed the AIIMS director to set up a medical board to review Asaram's medical report
 nyaayalay ne yah bhi kaha tha ki agar jarurat ho to unka medical test yah nirdhaarit karne ke liye kiya jaae ki kya jodhpur balaatkaar maamle main unhen antarim jamaanat di jaani chahie
 Cases have been set against Asaram in Jodhpur court for rape, criminal conspiracy and other offenses for allegedly sexually assaulting a minor girl in Jodhpur ashram

 Salman Khanki has not known how many nights he has slept and is still flying
 vahi raat
 
 jo kabhi hit and ran ke naam se surkhiyon main ai to kabhi gaiyr-iradatan katl kii shakl main
 Same night
 
 In which Salman was seen getting off the driving seat of the car and sometimes missing
 us ek raat main kareeb paanch kilometre kaa faasla tay karne nikle salmaan khan 13 saal baad bhi sukun kii manzil par nahin pahunch sake hai, lekin ab 6 may subah thik sava gyaarah baje is cese ko uski manzil milane ja rahi he
 If you touch even Salman Khanmitti who is going through the golden phase of his career, it becomes gold
 wo salmaan khan jisane sau karod se zyada kii kamai karne vaali filmon kii jhadi si laga di he
 But the fate of this Alexander of Muqaddar was never the same
 shoharat or musiibat donon salmaan ke saath judawaan kii tarah chipke rahe
 The ghost of the hit and run case has been following Salman for the last 13 years and that forces him to appear in real courtroom outside the film set again and again
 salmanka kad tab bhi us 70 mem kii screen se kahin zyada bada tha jiske bade parde ke wo bade sitare the par bada sitara hone ke saath-saath bollywood ke bade bigadel kaa bhi khitaab tab tak wo hasil kar chuke the
 Salman Khan, along with his cousin Kamal Khan, left home at 9
30 pm amidst the super hit success of 'hum Dil De Chuke Sanam' and Aishwarya Rai's name in the name of 'tadap-tadap' Huh
 baahar unka bodyguard or mumbai police kaa consteble rabindra patil khadaa tha
 Kamal tells Patil that Rain Bar, Juhu has to go
 rabindra patil ke police ko die bayaan ke mutabiksphed rang kii toyta land kruger car khudsalmandrive karte hai or phir teenon juhu pahunchate hai
 According to Rain Bar manager Rizwan Rakhangi, there were a lot of celebrities in the bar that night
 salmaan ke haath main usne safed rang kaa glass dekha tha, jisamen safed liquid jaisaa kuch tha
 According to Rizwan, Salman and his friends placed orders for foster beers, cosmopolitan cocktails, white Bacardi rum and snacks, with a total bill of around ten thousand rupees
 rain baar se nikalne ke badasalmankuch der ke liye hotel jedbluue mariet jate hai or phir vahaan se der raat ko teenon ghar ke liye nikal jate hai
 Salman leaves the party after three in the night
 sarkari vakil kehete hai ki wo nashe main the, par salmaan khan kehete hai ki unhone us raat baar main sirf pani piya tha
 He had a white Toyota Land Cruiser car that night to go home
 gaadi chalaane ke liye saath main bodyguard kam driver bhi
 Salman's car reaches Bandra's Hill Road in the dark of night at around three o'clock
 
 The speed of the car was extremely fast
 lihaaja hill road par american express bekri se kuch pehle hi achaanak driver gaadi kaa santulan kho baithta he or pal bhar main gaadi bain taraf se sadak chhod kar footpath par daudane lagati he
 Five employees working at the American Express Bakery were sleeping on the same sidewalk at that time from Badnasibi
 tej raftaar land kruger paanchon ko raudate hue aage nikalati he or phir dukaan ke shater se takaraa kar gaadi ruk jaati he
 According to police, Salman Khan suddenly gets nervous after the accident
 tab tak gaadi ke footpath se takaraane or ghayalon kii cheekh-pukaar sun kar aasapaas so rahe baaki log bhi jaag jate hai
 People take out the people trapped under the car and are taken to the hospital
 salmaan kuch der baad gaadi maukey par hi chhod kar gaayab ho jate hai par 70 mem kii screen se bhi jiskaa kad bada ho, uski ek jhalak use pahchaanane ke liye kaaphi hoti he
 Many people had recognized Salman before running away
 haadase main ek majdoor kareeb-kareeb maukey par hi dam tod detaa he, jabaki chaar majdoor buree tarah se jakhmi ho jate hai
 The legs of most of the four were trampled by the car
 chaar ghayalon main se ek muslim niamat shaikh ne shuruuaat main police ko bataaya tha ki haadase ke vakt wo so rahaa tha
 Just then, with a loud sound, something on his left foot climbed, which opened his eyes
 shaikh ne bataaya ki usne salmaan khan ko gaadi ke daahine daravaaje yani driver kii seat se neeche utarate dekha tha
 But later in the magistrate court, Sheikh said that he did not see Salman getting off the driver's seat
 is haadase se pehle salmaan khan kaale hiran ke shikaar or aishwarya raay ke saath apane gusse ko lekar surkhiyaan bator chuke the, lihaaza is haadase kii khabar ko failte bhi der nahin lagi
 Salman had disappeared from the scene after the accident
 police ghar pahunchi, to wo ghar par bhi nahin mili, lekin salmaan
 
 
 
 salmaan khan the, chhupana mushkil tha
 So after about eight hours, they themselves come forward
 subah hote-hote puri mumbai main khabar fail chukithi
 Salman Khan had another stain on his son, but Salman himself was missing since the accident
 gaadi kaa number or chashmadid salmaan ke khilaaf chugali kha chuke the
 So in the morning the police reach Salman's house but Salman was not at home
 darasal salmaan khan kanoonee salaah ke liye kuch vakt chaahate the
 That is why he was missing
 unhen pataa tha ki zyada der bhaagane se mushkilen bad sakati hai
 There will be difficulty in getting bail
 lihaaja haadase ke kareeb aath ghante baad wo khud saamne aate hai or aakhirkaar bandra police unhen giraftaar kar leti he
 After the arrest, Salman is taken to JJ Hospital, where Salman's blood sample is taken
 salmaan ke khilaaf police laaparvaahee or khatarnaak dhang se gaadi chalaane kaa maamla darj kar leti he
 He is also released on bail shortly after arrest due to non-bailable section with a fine of only Rs 950
 salmaan kii itani aasaani rihaai kaa kuch saamaajik sanghathan virodh karte hai or paanch aktubar 2002 ko adaalat pahunchate jate hai
 They file a public interest litigation against Salman in the court and demand a non-willful murder case against Salman
 adaalat naa sirf yachika manjuur kar leti he balki police ko salmaan ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 304-2 yani gaiyr iradatan hatya kaa mukadmaa darj karne kaa hukum detii he
 The maximum punishment under this is ten years imprisonment
 adalati aadesh milte hi police 7 aktubar 2002 ko gaiyr iradatan hatya ke jurm main salmaan ko phir se giraftaar kar leti he
 Salman goes to jail
 wo puure 18 dinon tak jail main rahete hai
 During this time, they apply for bail four times
 magar chaaron baar jamaanat kii arji khaarij ho jaati he
 Then 18 days later, on 24 October 2002, Salman gets bail and is released
 rihaai ke baad salmaan khanmarch 2003 main mumbai seshan court main unke khilaaf gaiyr idathan hatya kaa maamla darj karne ke faisle ko chunauti dete hai
 But within two months, in May 2003, the sessions court not only rejects his application but also orders the magistrate court to prepare a charge sheet against Salman
 haalanki salmaan ne kanoonee ladaai jari rakhi
 They now challenge the Sessions Court's decision in the Bombay High Court to remove the section of self-imposed murder
 is cese me salmaan ko yahaan pehali raahat milti he
 The Bombay High Court removes Section 304-II of the IPC
 court kaa kahana tha ki is cese main ye dhara feet nahin baithti
 This happiness came for a very short time for Salman
 kroonki bombai hai court ke faisle ke khilaaf aktubar 2003 main maharashtra sarkaar supreme court pahunch gai
 He argued that the case was a case of culpable homicide
 do maheene ke intjaar ke baad disambar 2003 main supreme court se salmaan khan ko sabase bada jhatka mila
 The Supreme Court, while ruling the Bombay High Court judgment, said that Salman will be tried for non-willful murder or not, the magistrate court will decide
 ab chunki magistrate court pehle hi police se ipisi kii dhara 304-2 ke tahat salmaan ke khilaaf chargeshit daayar karne kaa hukum suna chuki thi lihaaja ab bas trial shuru hona baaki tha
 The Mumbai Police registers a case against Salman Khan under Section 304 (II) of the IPC under the Motor Vehicles Act 1988 and the Bombay Prohibition Act 1949 under Sections 279, 337, 338 and 427
 chargeshit main salmaan khan ke khilaaf chaar bade iljamalgae jate hai
 First, at the time of the accident, Salman Khan was driving a Toyota Land Cruiser car
 doosraa, salmaan kii car kii raftaar behad tej thi
 Third, Salman fled from the scene after the accident
 or chauthaa us raat salmaan ne saamaanya maatra se zyada sharaab pi thi
 Most of these charges were based on the statements of Salman's security guard and Mumbai Police constable Ravindra Patil
 patil ne hi sabase pehle police ko bayaan diya tha ki baar se nikalne ke baad salmaan nashe main the or uske manaa karne ke baad bhi vahi gaadi chalaa rahe the
 And the speed of the train was also around 90 to 100 kilometer per hour
 rabindra patil is maamle main ek ahm chashmadid tha
 Yes yes tha
 Because Patil died on October 3, 2007
 rabindra patil mumbai police main consteble tha
 According to the statement he gave to the police after the accident, that night he was sitting in the car at par with Salman Khan
 adaalat ne patil kii maut ke baad bhi uske bayaan ko cese kaa ek ahm hissaa mana he
 But on behalf of Salman Khan, it was said in the court that the night the accident took place, Ravindra Patil was sleeping in the car all the way
 use kuch pataa hi nahin tha
 Ravindra Patil in his first statement did not even tell the police that Salman was drunk on the night of the accident
 balki ye baat usne chaar maheene baad kahi
 After the charge sheet was filed, the case continued in court
 is dauraan cese main kai mode aate hai
 First of all it is said from Salman that he was not driving that night
 balki gaadi unka driver ashok singh chalaa rahaa tha
 Salman also denied drinking alcohol
 saath hi bhi iljaam lagaaya ki unka blad sample jaanboojh kar badal diya gaya tha
 JS Hospital doctor Shashikant Pawar had said in the opening statement that Salman had earlier refused to give his blood sample
 magar unke munh se sharaab kii bu aa rahi thi
 Later, before the magistrate, Dr
 Shashikant said that it is difficult to say that Salman's mouth was smelling of alcohol
 jahaan tak blead sample kii baat thi to salmaan ke vakil kaa kahana tha ki us sample ke saath chhedchhad kii gai he
 It was argued that on that day two different blood sample vials were sent to the lab, but they did not have a name chit
 is cese main kul 28 gavaah pesh hue
 Only one of these witnesses was from Salman Khan
 driver ashok singh
 The remaining 27 witnesses testified against Salman on behalf of the prosecution
 inamen se kai gavaah aise the jinhone police ko jo bayaan diya adaalat main usase palat gaye
 During the trial, Mumbai police produced a total of 27 witnesses against Salman Khan in the court
 jabaki salmaan kii taraf se sirf ek gavaah pesh hua
 Salman's driver Ashok Singh
 salmaan ke khilaaf jo 27 gavaah pesh hue wo hai

 Dhoni two World Cup winners captainbole - Very difficult to replicate
 Former Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said that moments like the great reception of his team that won the T20 World Cup in 2007 and the World Cup in 2011 are very close to his heart

 On a promotional event in Mumbai, Dhoni said, 'I would like to mention two incidents here, we came to India after the (T20) World Cup in 2007 and we traveled in an open bus and we were in Marine Drive (mumbai) Standing har taraf jam laga tha or log hamaare swaagat ke liye apni kaaron main aae the
 'when will we finally return? Dhoni's answer- Don't ask till January, he said, 'so i was happy to see happiness on everyone's face
 kyonki darshakon main kai aise log rahe honge jinaki udaan chhot gai hogi, ho saktaa he ki ve kisi mahatvapurn kaam se ja rahe hon
 It was a great welcome
 puraa marine drive ek chor se duusare chor tak bharaa tha
 'T20 World Cup 2007 The second incident that Dhoni mentioned was the moment of the World Cup final match played in 2011 in Mumbai when India was close to victory and the audience was shouting' Vande Mataram '
 dhoni ne is mahatvapurn match main naabad 91 ran banaae the
 He said, 'and the second incident was of the 2011 World Cup final
 match main jab 15-20 ran chahie the tab jis tarah se vankhede stadium main darshak ‘vande maataram’ kaa udghosh kar rahe the
 Dhoni said, "these are two sentences
" mujhe lagata he ki unhen doharaana bahut mushkil hoga
 These two incidents are very close to my heart
 ’ dhoni ne kaha ki cricket anischitataaon kaa khel he jiske kaaran desh main yah sabase adhik lokapriy he
 He said, 'there is a lot of uncertainty when it comes to cricket and that is why i think it is the most popular in the country
 prayek gend yaa jab bhi gendbaaj gend karne aata he to vah match kaa nakshaa badal saktaa he
 i believe that in reality every ball in the T20 can change the map of the match

 is par peedita ke pita kaa aarope he or police ne diene jaanch ke liye liya gaya blad sample badal diya tha
 Meanwhile, the accused has been married elsewhere

 The Mainpuri police of Uttar Pradesh arrested Ekfarji IAS on Wednesday
 aaropee suresh kumaar khud ko banda janapad kaa dm bataata tha or naukari kaa jhansa detaa tha
 There is a charge of cheating lakhs of rupees against this fake DM
 police se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, emessi kii padhai puri karne ke baad aaropee suresh kumaar urf esake singh upiessi kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha
 The case is related to Bhawat village in Thana Elau area

 Prabhu Dayal met a fake officer in Bahadurpur, Haryana
 us samay esake singh ne khud ko pisies adhikari bataakar city magistrate bataaya tha
 According to Prabhudayal, in December 2014, SK Singh stated that he has become a UP cadre KIAS officer and is posted in Banda district
 dilachasp yah he ki banda janapad main tainaat asli dm kaa naam bhi suresh kumaar hi he
 It is alleged that by taking advantage of the name, fake DM Suresh Kumar told Prabhu Dayal on phone in January that he had two peon posts vacant and he could get a job
 iske liye aaropee ne do lakh rupee prati pad ke hisaab se paise maange
 Prabhu Dayal also put two lakh rupees in the account of the fake officer
 farvari main farji adhikari ne ek baar phir phone kar ek or rikt pad kii baat kii, jiske evaj main 50 hajaar rupee or khate ke jamaa kiya gaya
 When we went to meet, it is said that in the meantime, Prabhudayal reached Banda to meet Suresh Kumar, but the whole secret was revealed as soon as he reached the DM office
 asaliyat kii samaj hote hi prabhudayal ne farji dm ko phone kiya, jisapar usne kaha ki vah abhi chuttee par he
 According to Jala Prabhudayal, who was set up to trap him, to trap the fake DM and hand him over to the police, he told SK Singh that he had come to his village Mainpuri in a hurry and collected a few rupees

 samaajawaadee party ke muslim cheharaa ajam khan ne 17 saal pehle rampur kii siyasat main apane sabase bade siyaasi dushman nur bano ko maat dene ke liye jis turup ke pattey kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Today, when the BJP has put the same trump card against them, Azam Khan has come down against him and crossed all boundaries
 ajam khan kii taaja tippanee ko lekar jaya pradaa ne kaha he ki is baar to unhone had paar di he
 Jaya Prada said that now my ability is over and Azam Khan has created so much animosity that now what are those brothers, nothing is left of me
 donon netaaon ke bich adaavat aaj kii nahin he balki dushmani kii khai kaaphi pehle paidaa ho gai thi
 The people of Rampur have seen this revolution in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 darasal, ajam khan ke virodh ke baavjood jaya pradaa ko mulaayam singh yadav ne sapa ke tikat par rampur loksabhaa seat se 2009 kaa chunaav ladaaya
 Azam Khan was angered by this and strongly opposed Jaya Prada by going against the party line
 haalanki, wo jaya pradaa ko haraane main safal nahin ho paae, lekin donon ke bich kii talkhi har taraf charchaa kaa vishay bani
 Even Azam Khan fell out of the SP and was expelled
 jaya pradaa kii ashleel tasviren bhi rampur main baantne ke aarope lage
 Now in the election campaign Jaya Prada herself is claiming that Azam Khan can do anything and my pornographic photographs were spread to discredit me
 haalanki, ajam khan or jaya pradaa ke bich vivaad kii badi vajah purv sapa netaa amar singh ko mana jaataa he
 The then sp's Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh have been very close
 2004 main amar singh ke kehane par ajam khan ne hi jaya pradaa ko rampur se loksabhaa chunaav ladvaya, jisamen unhen jeet mili
 But soon the impact of the sourness in Amar Singh and Azam Khan's relationship started to appear between Jaya Prada and Azam Khan
 jab 2009 main dobaaraa jaya pradaa ko sapa ne tikat diya to ajam khan khan naaraaz ho gaye or unhone tikat se lekar chunaav ladane tak jaya pradaa kii mukhaalafat kii
 Rhetoric between the two leaders The resentment between the two leaders is often seen in their statements
 chunaav se pehle saal 2018 main jab padmavat film ai to usamen khilji ke rup main dikhaae gaye villen kii tulana jaya pradaa ne ajam khan se kii
 Azam Khan also often criticized Jaya Prada as Nachaniya
 yahaan tak ki jaya pradaa saarvajanik manch se rote hue ajam khan ke vyavhaar kii aalochana karti rahi hai
 Now that both are contesting the 2019 Lok Sabha elections face-to-face, this round of rhetoric has started crossing the border
 jaya pradaa chunaav prachaar main 2009 kaa zikr karte hue ajam khan par apni ashleel photo share karne ke aarope laga rahi hai
 Azam Khan has even commented on underwear, which he is criticizing from all sides

 Let me tell you that after taking the moral responsibility of his party's defeat in the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, after breaking ties with BJP in June 2013, Nitish resigned from the post of Chief Minister and made Jitan Ram Manjhi as the successor
 243 sadasyeey bihar vidhansabha main us samay jediu ke 100 se adhik vidhayak the, jabaki bhaajapa ke paas lagbhag 90 vidhayak the
 In February 2015, Manjhi resigned from the post of Chief Minister after Nitish was elected as Chief Minister in place of Manjhi by JDU and formed a separate party called ham-secular in collaboration with its supporting leaders in JDU
 dilachasp baat yah he ki lalu ne us samay nitish kaa samarthan kiya tha or maanjhi par centre main bhaajapa nit rajg sarkaar ke haathon main khilne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Manjhi joined the bjp-led NDA alliance at the time of the 2015 Bihar assembly elections, but won only one seat
 nitish ne mahagathbandhan main shaamil rajd or congress se naata todakar pichley saal bhaajapa ke saath milakar bihar main rajg kii nai sarkaar bana lee thi
 a few months later, Manjhi left the NDA and joined the Grand Alliance
 maanjhi ne kaha 'susheel modi jo kah rahe hai vah niraadhaar he
 This is a cover-up for the failures of the NDA government at the Center and in Bihar, where Nitish Kumar was blackmailed by Narendra Modi to join hands with the BJP
 ' unhone kaha 'maine nitish or lalu donon ke saath kaam kiya he
 i can say from experience that Lalu fights his opponents openly
 vah nitish kii tarah nahin hai
 Responding to Sushil Modi's allegations, Tejashwi tweeted, "sushil Modi is shocked to see defeat
 maansik divaaliepan kii paraakaashtha langhakar kah rahe hai ki laluji sangh se mili hue hai
 Lalu ji is the one who has put a finger in the eyes of the Sanghis, and has screwed a rope in the nose of the unruly Sanghis
 ' tejasvi ne yah bhi kaha, 'lalu ji ne sangh kii ghrunit nafarti raajnneeti ko bihar main paanv pasaarne nahin diya
 Advani ji was pulled out and stopped his frenzied journey
 15 varsh main ek bhi danga nahin hone diya
 'sushil Modi made this claim at a time when Rabri Devi, the wife of RJD chief Lalu and former Chief Minister, had recently claimed that Nitish, through disillusionment with the BJP, rejoined the grand alliance through his envoy Prashant Kishore
 Had tried unsuccessfully
 modi ne kaha, 'main yah khulaasa sirf lalu prasad ke charitra ko rekhaankit karne ke liye kar rahaa hum, jo apane hiton kii raksha ke liye kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai
 He was also offering to dust off his arch rival Nitish Kumar and later formed a grand alliance with him
 ' susheel ne lalu par aarope lagaaya 'lalu bhaajapa-aresas gathbandhan ke khilaaf jehar ugalate rahete hai, lekin vah kabhi hamaari madad lene main hichakate nahin the
 The ABVP may have helped the Patna University student union win elections in the 1970s or become chief minister of Bihar after two decades
 ' unhone kaha, 'log in chizon ko vaise samay main jaananaa chaahate the jab unki taraf se bahut kuch kaha ja rahaa he
 Sushil's reference was to the recent claims of Tejashwi and his mother Rabri Devi in which he alleged that Nitish had become disenchanted with the BJP within six months of his return to the NDA in July 2017 and to align with the RJD
 He sent his messenger Prashant Kishore to try unsuccessfully
 rashtriya rajdhani dilli main naale kii safai ke liye dijal gadiyon ko kharidne ke maamle main supreme court ne dakshin dilli nagar nigam par 50 hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana lagaaya he

 ) In the last four years, the central government tried to spy on the common people through social media
 iskaa khulaasa enditivi kii padtaal main hua he
 The investigation has revealed that the government tried to do this a total of 7 times between 2014 and 2018
 iske liye baqayda nijee form se sampark bhi kiya gaya
 According to media reports in May this year, on 25 April 2018, the government pulled out a similar tender which was canceled after the intervention of the Supreme Court
 unic aaidentification othirity of india dwaara soshal media ko monitor karne ke liye isi tarah ke ek prayaas 18 july 2018 ko sabhi ke saamne aayaa
 However, this attempt was also rejected by the Supreme Court
 is maamle kii pehali sunwaayee isi shuukravaar ko puri gai gai he
 It is worth noting that NDTV found in its investigation that the Central Government started contacting such firm only after coming to power in 2014
 ise lekar pehla tender 1 disambar 2014 ko nikaala gaya
 This tender was issued by the Ministry of External Affairs
 or iske saath hi special media monitering foulder banane kii bhi baat kahi gai thi
 While the second tender was withdrawn on 3 December 2015
 is baar tender soochna evam prasaaran mantralay ne jari kiya tha
 It asked to monitor personal social media accounts and users
 isi soochna evam prasaaran mantralay ne aage chalakar do or tender jari kiye
 The first tender was released on 5 February 2016 and the second on 10 July 2017
 5 farvari ko jari kiye gaye tender main lisning tul jabaki 10 july ke tender main soshal media par chal rahe over ol trends ko trek karne kii baat kahi gai
 The comments jabaki 16 may 2016 ko jari soochna evam prasaaran mantralay ke tender negative centiments ko neutrlij karne ko kaha gaya tha
 The special thing is that when NDTV approached the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting regarding these tenders, Arun Kumar, deputy director of the media and communication division of the ministry said that we will forward your questions to senior officials and if they have any questions on these questions If given the answer, it will be given to you
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki haalanki ab sarkaar khudako peeche kar liya he lekin iske baavjood bhi is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki sarkaan ne bade str par logon kii jasusi karaane kii koshish kii
 Internet policy expert Amba Kak said that such a tool definitely surveys everyone's social media accounts, but there are two big questions
 pehla to yah ki vah ise kaise karte
 Especially if they see the private post of common people
 agar vah aisa karte to nishchit taur par vah soshal media sarvice ke niyamon kaa ulanghan karte
 a similar effort by the Unique Identification Authority of India to monitor social media came to the fore on 18 July 2018
 haalanki is koshish ko bhi supreme court ne nakaar diya
 The first hearing of the case has been completed on this Friday
 gauratlab he ki enditivi ne apni jaanch main paaya ki is tarah ke form se centre sarkaar ne 2014 main satta main aane ke baad hi sampark karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 The first tender was taken out on 1 December 2014
 yah tender videsh mantralay ne jari kiya tha
 And with this, there was also talk of making a special media monitoring folder
 jabaki doosraa tender 3 disambar 2015 ko nikaala gaya
 This time the tender was released by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
 isamen vyaktigat soshal media account or yujar kii monitering karne ko kaha gaya tha
 The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting subsequently issued two more tenders
 pehla tender 5 farvari 2016 or doosraa 10 july 2017 ko jari kiya gaya
 The tender released in the tender on 5 February while the 10 July tender was said to track all the ongoing trends on social media
 tippaniyan Whereas the tender negative sentiments of Ministry of Information and Broadcasting issued on 16 May 2016 were asked to neutralize
 khaas baat yah he ki jab enditivi ne in tender ko lekar soochna evam prasaaran mantralay se sampark kiya to mantralay ke media and communication divijan ke dipti diarector arun kumaar ne kaha ki ham aapke sawaalon ko varisht adhikariyon tak pahunchaa denge or agar unhone in sawaalon par koi jawaab diya to isaki soochna aapako de di jaaegi
 Experts say that although now the government has backfired but even then it cannot be denied that the government tried to spy people on a large scale
 internet policy kii jaankaar amba kaak ne kaha ki is tarah kaa ek upkaran nishchit rup se sabhi ke soshal media khaaton kaa surveykshan karata he, lekin do bade prashn hai
 The first is how he would do it

 kya tumhaari koi garlfriend thi? kya tum donon ke bich kuch hua bhi tha?2
 What do you think about One Night Stand? 3
 kya tumhen mere kapade pasand nahin? kya shaadi ke baad tumhen meraa choti dresses pahananaa pasand nahin aayega?4
 Will you cook occasionally after marriage? Or are you assuming that i will cook both the time? 5
 main kabhi bhi kaam karnaa nahin chhoduungi or baad main tum mujhe iske liye majaboor nahin karoge
 6
 tum itane achche ho phir bhiib tak single kaise ho?7
 Do you believe in God? 8
 kya tum ab bhi apni eks ko pyaar karte ho?9

 'teen', released this week, is directed by Ribhu Dasgupta and Sujoy Ghosh is one of its producers
 
 
 starcast kii baat karen to film main hai amitabh bachchan, navazuddin siddiki, vidya baalan or sabyasachi chakravarti
 
 
 i will not talk too much about the story, because there is suspense in the film, which can open, and i do not want to spoil your fun
 
 
 so, sirf itnaa bataaungaa ki yah kahani he jon vishwaas kii, jo aath saal pehle hue apni potee ke apharan ko aaj bhi nahin bhul paaya he or aaj bhi use talash he us apradhi kii, jisane apharan kiya
 
 
 The film stars Amitabh Bachchan as John Vishwas, Nawaz as Father Martin, Vidya Balan playing Inspector Sarita and Sabyasachi Chakraborty as Manohar
 
 
 film kii kaamiyaan or kuubiyaan bataane se pehle kuch khaas baaten
 
 
 Two days before the release of the film, i
e
 on Wednesday, the film was shown to critics and the following day, on Thursday, director Ribhu and actor Amitabh Bachchan met journalists and critics in a small gathering, in which Amitabh said that his back of the gathering The only intention is that he and the filmmakers can find out their shortcomings, so that they can rectify them in future
 
 
 saath hi ve aalochakon kaa nazariyaa bhi jaan saken ki ve kisi film ko kis tarah aankate hai, taaki uski madad se ve bhavishya main apane kaam main sudhaar laa saken
 
 
 i was also involved in the meeting
 
 
 main to ise ek nirbhik pahal kahuunga, bhale hi kuch log ise prachaar kaa nayaa tarika kahen, kyonki film dikhaane ke baad koi bhi abhinayta yaa filmkaar apni aalochanaon kaa saamana nahin karnaa chahta or kaamiyaan to bilkul nahin sunanaa chahta, lekin yahaan big bi or nirdeshak ribhu ne tarifein bhi sunin or kaamiyaan bhi, or kuch baaten jo logon ko samaj nahin ain, unhe samajhaayaa bhi
 
 
 First of all, congratulations to the team on their move
 
 
 ab main baat karuunga kaamiyon kii, un khaamiyon kii, jo is sabha main saamne rakhi gayi
 
 
 i agree with some of these, and not with some
 
 
 to ye he us sabha main saamne rakhi gai kaamiyaan
 
 
 As a thriller, some people found the film slow
 
 
 kuch logon ko film main amitabh bachchan or nawaz kaa rishta samaj nahin aayaa, yaa us par ek sawalia nishaan tha
 
 
 Some felt that if Amitabh Bachchan's character wanted it, the story could have been carried out in advance and in the film, so much of the frills were done only to make the film or it was convenient
 
 
 kuch ne kaha, film main jo doshi he, use duusare apharan ke baad pehle hi anumaan ho janaa chahie tha, or apana gunaah kabool kar lenaa chahie tha
 
 
 Some believed that he could not indulge in the film as an audience
 
 
 jinhone film nahin dekhi, unhen ye bate samaj nahin aaengi, or vaise main bhi khud bahut bachakar bol rahaa hum ki kahin suspence na khul jaae
 
 
 Well these were the flaws mentioned in the meeting, but i do not agree with all these things, except one
 
 
 vah he - amitabh bachchan kaa kirdaar chahta to kahani ko pehle hi anjaam tak pahunchaa saktaa tha, yaa police kii madad le saktaa tha
 
 
 Apart from this, there was another problem which i felt - when the character of the film, Manohar, hears the phone for ransom, why does he not recognize the voice
 
 
 to mere hisaab se ye thi kaamiyaan or ab baat kuubiyon kii, jinamein pehle ve, jinka zikr sabha main hua
 
 
 People liked the work of Amitabh Bachchan in the film, and felt 'hatke'
 film kii editing kamaal kii lagi
 The lyrics and music of the film was very good
 film kaa kahani kehane kaa tarika, yani nerrative kamaal kaa he
 Nawaz's work was felt by the people as 'offending'
 tippaniyan i think these are all good qualities in the film, but i add something else
 
 
 mujhe film dhimi nahin lagi or saath hi main film kii kahani ke saath safar kar rahaa tha or jon vishwaas ke saath main bhi apradhi kii talash main tha
 
 
 The screenplay of the film is kaabil-e-praise and also the script
 
 
 film kii cinemotographi film ke mizaaj ko or umdaa karti he or saath hi becoground score film ke imoshan ko ujagar karata he
 
 
 And also the controlled direction of Ribhu
 
 
 to kul milakar ye sabhi kuubiyaan hai film main or yakeenan ek acchhee film he, to jaaie or film dekhie
 
 
 This film from my side 3
 5 star
 
 
 Some special things before telling the film's shortcomings and features
 
 
 film kii release se do din pehle, yani buudhvaar ko film aalochakon ko dikhaa di gai or agle din brihaspativaar ko nirdeshak ribhu or abhinayta amitabh bachchan ek choti-si sabha main patrkaar or aalochakon se mukhaatib hue, jisamen amitabh ne kaha ki sabha ke peeche unki manshaa sirf yah he ki unhen or filmkaaron ko unki kaamiyaan pataa lag saken, taaki bhavishya main ve inhen sudhaar saken
 
 
 At the same time, they can also know the attitude of critics how they rate a film, so that with the help of it, they can improve their work in the future
 
 
 sabha main main bhi shaamil tha
 
 
 i would call it a bold initiative, even though some people call it a new way of publicity, because no actor or filmmaker wants to face their criticisms after the film is shown and listen to the flaws at all, but here Big b and the director Ribhu also heard praises and flaws, and explained some things that people did not understand
 
 
 to pehle to team ke is kadam ke liye unhen badhai
 
 
 Now i will talk about the flaws, the flaws that were put in front of this meeting
 
 
 inamen se kuch ke saath main sahamat hum, or kuch ke saath nahin
 
 
 So this is the flaw placed in front of that assembly
 
 
 bataur thriller, kuch logon ko film kii gati dhimi lagi
 
 
 Some people did not understand the relationship of Amitabh Bachchan and Nawaz in the film, or there was a question mark on it
 
 
 kuch ko laga, amitabh bachchan kaa kirdaar chahta to kahani ko pehle hi anjaam tak pahunchaa saktaa tha or film main itnaa tamzam sirf film ko gadhane ke liye kiya gaya yaa suvidhanusaar kiya gaya
 
 
 Some said, who is guilty in the film should have already guessed after the second kidnapping, and confessed his crime
 
 
 kuch kaa maananaa tha ki ve bataur darshak film main lipt nahin ho paae
 
 
 Those who have not seen the film will not understand these things, and i myself am speaking very sparingly that suspense does not open
 
 
 khayr ye thi ve kaamiyaan jinka zikr sabha main hua, lekin in sabhi baton se main ittefaq nahin rakhata, sivaay ek ke
 
 
 That is - if the character of Amitabh Bachchan had wanted, the story could have been reached in advance, or the police could have taken help
 
 
 iske alaava ek or kaami jo mujhe lagi - film kaa kirdaar manohar jab-jab phiroti ke liye phone sunata he, to vah awaz kyon nahin pahchaan paata
 
 
 So according to me, these were flaws and now it is about the things, including those which were mentioned earlier in the meeting
 
 
 film main amitabh bachchan kaa kaam logon ko kaaphi pasand aayaa, or 'hatke' laga
 The editing of the film was amazing
 film ke gaanon ke bol or sangeet kaaphi acha laga
 The film's way of telling the story, that is, is amazing
 nawaz kaa kaam logon ko 'hatke' laga
 The comments mere hisaab se ye sabhi kuubiyaan hai film main, lekin main kuch or jodta hum
 
 
 i did not find the film slow and at the same time i was traveling with the story of the film and along with John Biswas i was also looking for the culprit
 
 
 film kaa screenple kaabil-e-taareef he or script bhi
 
 
 The film's cinematography adds to the mood of the film and the background score highlights the film's emotion
 
 
 or saath hi ribhu kaa niyantrit nirdesan
 
 
 So overall all these things are in the film and it is definitely a good film, so go and watch the film
 
 
 meri taraf se is film ko 3
 5 stars

 As a thriller, some people found the film slow
 
 
 kuch logon ko film main amitabh bachchan or nawaz kaa rishta samaj nahin aayaa, yaa us par ek sawalia nishaan tha
 
 
 Some felt that if Amitabh Bachchan's character wanted it, the story could have been carried out in advance and in the film, so much of the frills were done only to make the film or it was convenient
 
 
 kuch ne kaha, film main jo doshi he, use duusare apharan ke baad pehle hi anumaan ho janaa chahie tha, or apana gunaah kabool kar lenaa chahie tha
 
 
 Some believed that he could not indulge in the film as an audience
 
 
 jinhone film nahin dekhi, unhen ye bate samaj nahin aaengi, or vaise main bhi khud bahut bachakar bol rahaa hum ki kahin suspence na khul jaae
 
 
 Well these were the flaws mentioned in the meeting, but i do not agree with all these things, except one
 
 
 vah he - amitabh bachchan kaa kirdaar chahta to kahani ko pehle hi anjaam tak pahunchaa saktaa tha, yaa police kii madad le saktaa tha
 
 
 Apart from this, there was another problem which i felt - when the character of the film, Manohar, hears the phone for ransom, why does he not recognize the voice
 
 
 to mere hisaab se ye thi kaamiyaan or ab baat kuubiyon kii, jinamein pehle ve, jinka zikr sabha main hua
 
 
 People liked the work of Amitabh Bachchan in the film, and felt 'hatke'
 film kii editing kamaal kii lagi
 The lyrics and music of the film was very good
 film kaa kahani kehane kaa tarika, yani nerrative kamaal kaa he
 Nawaz's work was felt by the people as 'offending'
 tippaniyan i think these are all good qualities in the film, but i add something else
 
 
 mujhe film dhimi nahin lagi or saath hi main film kii kahani ke saath safar kar rahaa tha or jon vishwaas ke saath main bhi apradhi kii talash main tha
 
 
 The screenplay of the film is kaabil-e-praise and also the script
 
 
 film kii cinemotographi film ke mizaaj ko or umdaa karti he or saath hi becoground score film ke imoshan ko ujagar karata he
 
 
 And also the controlled direction of Ribhu
 
 
 to kul milakar ye sabhi kuubiyaan hai film main or yakeenan ek acchhee film he, to jaaie or film dekhie
 
 
 This film from my side 3
 5 star
 
 
 Those who have not seen the film will not understand these things, and i myself am speaking very sparingly that suspense does not open
 
 
 khayr ye thi ve kaamiyaan jinka zikr sabha main hua, lekin in sabhi baton se main ittefaq nahin rakhata, sivaay ek ke
 
 
 That is - if the character of Amitabh Bachchan had wanted, the story could have been reached in advance, or the police could have taken help
 
 
 iske alaava ek or kaami jo mujhe lagi - film kaa kirdaar manohar jab-jab phiroti ke liye phone sunata he, to vah awaz kyon nahin pahchaan paata
 
 
 So according to me, these were flaws and now it is about the things, including those which were mentioned earlier in the meeting
 
 
 film main amitabh bachchan kaa kaam logon ko kaaphi pasand aayaa, or 'hatke' laga
 The editing of the film was amazing
 film ke gaanon ke bol or sangeet kaaphi acha laga
 The film's way of telling the story, that is, is amazing
 nawaz kaa kaam logon ko 'hatke' laga
 The comments mere hisaab se ye sabhi kuubiyaan hai film main, lekin main kuch or jodta hum
 
 
 i did not find the film slow and at the same time i was traveling with the story of the film and along with John Biswas i was also looking for the culprit
 
 
 film kaa screenple kaabil-e-taareef he or script bhi
 
 
 The film's cinematography adds to the mood of the film and the background score highlights the film's emotion
 
 
 or saath hi ribhu kaa niyantrit nirdesan
 
 
 So overall all these things are in the film and it is definitely a good film, so go and watch the film
 
 
 meri taraf se is film ko 3
 5 stars
 
 
 to mere hisaab se ye thi kaamiyaan or ab baat kuubiyon kii, jinamein pehle ve, jinka zikr sabha main hua

 purv main eiese se jude rahe kanhaiya kumaar pehali baar tab charchaa main aae the, jab unhen jeenyu parisar main kathith taur par bharat-virdohi naare lagane ke maamle main hiraasat main liya gaya tha
 Please tell, Delhi Police had filed a chargesheet in the recent JNU case in Patiala House Court
 yah chargeshit section-124 A,323,465,471,143,149,147,120B ke tahat pesh kii gai thi

 Police has also found a video giving speech of Kanhaiya
 iske saath hi kaha gaya he ki kanhaiya ko puure kaarykram kii pehle se jaankaree thi

 rashtriya mahila ayog ne mahila evam bal kalyaan vikaas mantralay ko maa ko kanoonee taur par naiysargik sangrakshak (natural gargian) kaa darja dene kii sifarish kii he
 The recommendations document sent to the ministry clearly states that India's 'hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956' neither to end the fundamental rights found in the constitution of the country nor all forms of discrimination against women
 Matches the opinion formed during the international conference held
 hindu minority and gargiyanships act,1956 ke mutabik naaballik bachche (ladkaa or gairshaadishuda ladki) kii gargiyanships or uski sampatti kii dekharekh kaa haq pita ko he, agar pita nahin he tabhi kanoon maa ko yah haq degaa
 Commission Chairman Rekha Sharma believes that "the law made for the right of guardianship is somewhere inspired by the thinking of a maleist or patriarchal society
" '' ve kahati hai, 'duniya ke zyaadaatar viksit deshon main maa ko yah haq bahut pehle diya ja chukaa he
 The same opinion was formed almost four decades ago at the international conference to prevent any discrimination against women
 samvidhan main mili moulik adhikaar bhi gender ke aadhaar par kisi tarah ke bhedbhaav ko gaiyrkanoonee tehraate hai
 The Women's Commission has started a debate demanding a change in this law made nearly 60 years ago
 haalanki ayog ne siforishein sambandhit mantralay ke paas bhej di he
 Now how serious the Ministry of Women and Child Welfare Development will be on this recommendation is a matter to be seen
 kyonki agar mahila evam bal kalyaan mantri ayog kii sifarish se ittefaq bhi rakhti hai to phir yah maamla kanoon mantralay ke paas jayega
 What the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act says, 1956 broadly, this law entitles the father to be a natural guardian
 pita kii gairmaujuudagi yaa phir santan ke pita kaa naam na maaloom hone kii sthiti main hi yah haq maa ko diya jaataa he
 International Contract Under the international agreement it was agreed that any discrimination against women should be considered illegal
 yah samjhauta 1979 main united neshans jaranal essembly main hua tha
 Unlike the fundamental rights found in the Constitution, the legal provisions of Article 14 and Article 15 of the Constitution are also against any kind of equality
 artical 14 jahaan kanoon ke samaksh har naagarik ko barabari kaa haq detaa he vahiin artical 15 gender ke adhaar par bhedbhaav kiye jane ko moulik adhikaar kaa hanan maanata he
 What is in other countries lawbritain - 'the Guardianship of Minors Act, 1973' gives equal rights to both mother and father
 sanyukt rajya-yahaan alag-alag rajyon main kanoon alag hai
 But the law of most states entitles both mother and father to be joint guardians
 talaak ke maamle main donon (maa or pita) ko barabari ke saath yah haq mila he
 In European Union countries, the mother has automatically got this right
 newjilandyaha bhi yah haq donon ko barabari se mila he

 There is a celebration of the announcement of the Inner Line Permit System, as opposed to the bill in other northeastern states including Assam, Tripura, there is an atmosphere of celebration after the announcement of the Inner Line Permit System in Manipur
 puure manipur main aaj saarvajanik chuttee kaa elaan kiya gaya he
 The announcement was made following the announcement by Union Home Minister Amit Shah
 amit shah ne loksabhaa main kaha ki naagarikta sanshodhan bill lagu hone se pehle manipur main inner line permit system ko lagu kiya jayega
 Currently, this permit is applicable in areas bordering international borders with Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland
 manipur main jahaan khushi manaai ja rahi he vahiin assam or tripura sahit purvottar ke anya rajyon main naagarikta sanshodhan bill kaa jamkar virodh kiya ja rahaa he
 All organizations in Assam and Tripura have called for a shutdown
 bataa den ki bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kii sahyogi indiinas pipal front of tripura (ipft) sahit kai adivasee samoohon ne somvaar konaagarikta sanshodhan vidheyakke khilaaf band kaa aayojan kiya, jiske chalate tripura tribal aria autonomas district council (titedisi) ke kshetron main janajivan prabhavit rahaa
 Due to this, road and rail traffic in Tripura was badly affected and thousands of passengers were stranded on the way, as the pro-bandh activists stopped vehicles and trains moving between Tripura and the rest of the country
 police ne kaha ki titedisi kshetron main kahin se koi badi apriy ghatana kii soochna nahin mili he
 The area, occupying two-thirds of the area of 10,491 square kilometers, has more than 1
2 million people, mostly tribals
 kisi bhi apriy sthiti se nipatane ke liye kendriya ardhsainik balon or tripura state rifles (tiesar) sahit baari sankhya main balon kii tainaat kii gai he
 Police have arrested some people for blocking the single rail line and highway connecting Tripura with the rest of the country via Assam
 band ke chalate tripura uniwarsity (kendriya vishvavidhyalay) or maharaja bir bikram vishvavidhyalay (tripura sarkaar ke tahat) donon hi vishvavidhyalayon kii parikshaon ko radd kar diya gaya
 The President of the world, the most powerful country in the world, Donald Trump is making a historic meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Singapore
 vahiin in sabake bich america main trump par hiton ke takaraav ke aarope laga he
 In fact, Washington and Maryland lawyers have accused the US President of illegally taking payments from foreign officials through one of his hotels in the capital
 vakeelon kaa kahana he ki videsh se aae hue adhikari trump ke hotel main thaharte hai or uske evaj main america raashtrapati iskaa laabh lete hai
 According to the allegation, the traffickers are guilty of collision and have not kept a proper distance from their business
 washington ke atorni general karl raccin or marilland ke atorni general bryan frosh ne kaha, 'videsh se aae hue mahatvapurn vyakti jo white house se laabh lenaa chaahate hai vah trump international hotel main hi rukna pasand karte hai
 In fact, Trump, after becoming President in January 2017, handed over his real estate business to his two sons, but the shares of Trump Organization still remain with Trump
 yahi vajah he ki trump par aarope lag rahe hai
 Explain that this matter is related to the 'privilege clause' of the US Constitution
