 
 We went to Cuttack
 inter paas hone or yogya hone ke baad bhi meraa naam katkut jaataa he
 i still don't get any trouble, but they complain that they too are worthy, from those who are telling themselves worth these days
 aaj kii kahani ke nayak hai- pehle laayak hai nitish kumaar or unase bijepi kii taraf se laayak ghoshit ho chuke narendra modi
 Nitish has just played his life, while Narendra Modi has been presenting his singing for a year
 rahul gandhi, mamata banerjee, jayalalita, mulaayam, mayawati
 Some of them take a name for themselves and another
 doosraa tisare kaa naam letaa he
 Anna says Mamta, Mamta says Jaya
 nirama kaa vigyaapan geet yaad aa gaya
 Everyone likes the redness of the chair
 sawaal yahaan daavedaari kii gambhirtha ko lekar he, aupchaarikta ko lekar nahin
 What should be the leader of the country, nowadays, the slogan is less public, only the leader puts more
 ve kehete hai naaraa lagaao, mere jaisaa ho
 After all, why did Nitish Kumar say in Bettiah that his curriculum vitae is bigger than Modi's curriculum vitae
 kya bina naam liye vah modi par hi tanj kar rahe the ki ham sab log vinamr log hai, isliye ham log koi bahut baat nahin kehete hai
 Compare the number of people walking
 ham koi bure hai kya? bhale hi vinamrata main hamaari koi daavedaari naa rahati ho, lekin jitne log gum rahe hai kisi ko sansad kaa tajurba nahin he, kisi ko rajya kaa tajurba nahin he
 Here the experience of Parliament is also there, it is also for the state and it is also useful
 baaten banane kaa tajurba nahin he
 Has Nitish Kumar given any serious challenge to Narendra Modi's claim or taken a pinch? yah sawaal rahul gandhi ke bare main bhi uthaa tha ki vah sirf saansad rahe hai, sarkaar kaa tajurba nahin
 How to be Chief Minister thrice is not entitled to the Prime Minister's eligibility
 kya saansad yaa kendriya mantri hone se koi vishesh fark aa jaataa he
 Rahul Gandhi is also giving the idea of leadership
 vah apni har raily main narendra modi kaa naam liye bagaiyr unki style par chot karte hai
 These are his words that brother can come and speak in such a stage, but to listen, one needs to bow his head, his ego, which is twisted, all of which is little, need to be suppressed
 It is because the leader cannot bring any change until the person presses himself and goes in the middle of the public
 iske liye rahul paathshaala kii tarah baadshaala lagaate hai, jahaan ek baade main kabhi adivasee hote hai, to kabhi rikhshawvale, to kabhi machuaare
 Does anyone become a leader by asking a few basic questions? yuddh kii training yuddh se pehle hoti he yaa yuddh ke dauraan
 Rahul's supporters say that when the North East students were sitting on a dharna in Delhi, Rahul went among them and Modi called him and talked to him
 unke bich nahin gaye
 But just rewind the tape, Narendra Modi also went to all the colleges
 rahul ne modi se pehle collejon main janaa shuru kiya, magar vah chunavi maheenon main collejon kaa rasta bhul gaye
 Modi hangout Google, called the farmers and talked, in some places also participated in the question and answer
 rahul twitor par nahin he, lekin kya narendra modi twitor par hokar samvaad kii sari sharte puri karte hai? kam hi dekha he jawaab dete hue baat karte hue
 Sometimes someone's tweet definitely escalates
 yah sara kuch swaabhaavik hote hue bhi marketing kii ranneeti kaa behad kharchila hissaa he
 Can Rahul give one or two interviews to gain the image of a leader who communicates in such a big country? Can Modi be a beloved leader in the election year without facing interviews with journalists across the country? Does it really matter to you or do you forget it by grinding it like a pea
 netritv ko lekar narendra modi ne bhi apane bhaashanon main kaaphi jor diya he
 He offers a new transformation by advancing the concept of strong leadership of Advani
 apni tamaam reliyon main netritv or iraade ko rekhaankit karte hai
 Speaking to industry representatives in Ahmedabad, Modi says that leadership matters a lot
 agar desh hamen jimmaa detaa he to jimmevary acchhee he to bhi leni padegi, buree hai to bhi jhelni padegi
 The country does not run by escaping
 mujhase log poochhate hai ki modi ji patna raily se aap bhaage kyon nahin? maine kaha ki bhaagna hi hota to modi paidaa hi nahin hota
 Bombs are ballasts, there was a crowd
 leadership main yah daayitv hota he ji
 In another place, Modi says that a great leader or a good leader is needed
 donon main bahut antar he
 Friends who live for themselves who try to make themselves big, even if they make them big, then they go and become great leaders
 lekin jo auron ke liye jeeta he, auron ke liye himmat jutata he, auron ke liye apane aap ko aahut karne kaa samarth rakhata he or tab jaakar ke jab duniya use leader maanane lagati he, vah good leader hota he
 So what is the leader of the country, this is prime time

 Book: Muyanjodaro (travelogue) Author: Om Thanvi Prakashkar: Vani Prakashan Editions: Hard Bound (118 pages) Price: 200 Rupees Every morning i live a little in the past
 kyonki roj shaam ko main thodaa sa bhavishya main mar jaataa hum
 Agnay, a two-line poem - Mu'anjodaro in the evening, the mound of the dead to say, but certainly a platform on which we can stand and see our beginning, our foundation
 us suraj ko bhi nae sire se mahasoos sakate hai, jisane hamaare aadi purushon ko bhi yun hi raahat, raushnee bakshi hogi
 a brilliant book by Muyanjodaro, journalist, author Om Thanvi
 shrenee ke lihaaj se yatra vrutant, aswaad kii drushti se kavita
 From the point of view of the text, a rich view of sentimentality, sensibility, sensitivity and most of all
 har chauthe panne par pasre rekha chitra is aswaad ko or bhi gadha kar dete hai
 Come on, let's do something hot before talking about it further
 kitaab kii shuruyaat rochak he
 Rather this quality has been retained throughout the book
 thanvi zikr karte hai apni karachi se monjodaro vaaya laadkana yatra kaa
 At the beginning of this, they get official advice
 karachi se baahar bina hathiyaarband guard ke yatra na karen
 There is a danger of bandits
 is khatre ke baavjood do doston kaa jattha dhundh ko dhata bataata hua praagetihaasik kaal kii jaan padati bas main aage badhata he
 In the beginning, the author remembers the mother's behavior
 or phir ek sabak
 The area that had gone so far in the minds of the elderly, has not returned yet
 bharosa kabhi aasaani se nahin lautataa
 And then something further
 
 
 neend bhi bharose kii tarah he, lautne ke maamle main
 Throughout the journey, Om makes hawkish but sharp comments on human instincts
 iske saath hi is mahadesh, jis par khinchi lakiron ke baad ab bharat pakistan se naam ho gaye hai, uski saajha viraasat kaa ullekh karte rahete hai
 For example, the history of Sindh under the pretext of qawwali sung in Shahbaz Kalander and his Ardas
 iske saath hi sthaneey bhugol ko lekar chale aitihaasik dwandv kaa bhi zikr aata he
 The language of the travelogue is poetry
 chote chote vaakya bahulata main
 This binds the rhythm of word pictoriality
 mukaam par pahunchate hi jaise lekhak apane urj main aa jaataa he
 Om is not only looking at the remnants of his first civilization with comfort, but also making the readers fellow with his description
 in sabake bich muanjodaro main milane vaali chizon ke bare main baat hoti he
 There is talk on the excavations here and their total accumulated findings
 itihaas lekhan or usko lekar chalane vaali vichaardhaara kii ladaai par bhi bharpoor raushnee daali jaati he
 There are photographs with every detail, in the form of sketches, which are helpful in understanding
 kaisaa hota he yah sab
 Understand from this example
 yah sach he ki kisi angan kii tuuti phooti seedhiyaan ab aapako kahin nahin le jaatin
 They go to the sky and remain unfulfilled
 lekin un adhure paaydaanon par khadey hokar anubhav kiya ja saktaa he ki aap duniya kii chat par khadey hai
 From there you are looking at history, not beyond it
 yaa phir dekhnaa apni aankh se dekhnaa he
 Everything else is a blink of an eye
 jaise yatra apane paanv se chalanaa he
 Everything else is rhythm
 aapane gaur kiya hoga ki kaise varnan ke bich main darshan aata he
 This increases the elegance of the entire article
 goyaa koi niabandh pard rahe hon
 The author considers Muenjodaro to be an Adithirtha
 or iske bhagnavsheshon ke bich ghoomane ke kram main apni maujuuda jadon kaa bhi sumiran karata he
 There is a longing, a flutter, to underline the orderliness or gradual development that has been present since then
 varnan ke kram main lekhak sindhu sabhyataa se jude aitihaasik vivaadon masalan, iske khatm hone kii vajahen, iskaa saraswati se rishta yaa phir iske sainya swaroop ko lekar bhi apana mat rakhte hai
 In some places, his ideological urges are clearly visible
 magar bina apane vichaar ke koi bhi varnan niraa nirjeev hi jaan padegaa
 Amidst all this, Om also sees everyone in the light of the knowledge of the present
 masalan, unhen saare vaicharik ghamaasan ke bich jorge orvel kii ukti yaad aati he
 The past will be occupied by the future
 or jo vartmaan par kabiz he, ateet par usee kaa kaabo hoga
 According to Om, the eyes of most of the idols found in Muyanjodaro are not blind
 uske peeche yoga kaa darshan chipa he
 In the words of the author, merging the ego of being an eye, closing the eyes and seeing yourself and the world with the inner eye
 shabdon ke paar maun main arth dhandhana
 Sitting in the foot and measuring the distance of time against the ambition of measuring the world with two feet
 kitaab bahut badi nahin he
 But it is filled with the nobility that our forefathers have provided to us
 ise jarur padhaa janaa chahie
 With this, we are better, some simple, some dignified and some free
 ek baat or
 Why does anyone else write a role in someone's book? idhar to nae sire se ye chalan dikhne laga he
 If you get a comment from a big or salable person, then the asking of the book increases in the market
 magar muanjodaro is maamle main bhi ek nayaa hi anubhav he
 Like the book, the role written by Krishnath also gives prosperity
 shuruyaat main hi krishnanath maano kitaab nahin puure paridrishy ke silsile main hi ek sutara de dete hai
 He writes, you read books
 sirf dekhen nahin
 You do not study today or tomorrow, see
 dekhi ke jor ko ek jaruri jatke kii tarah he ye baat
 So i recommend that you also read this book

 In this group named IPS Officer, the former DGP wrote this message on Saturday evening at 5:40 pm, but later deleted it
 unhone is bare main baat karne se manaa kar diya or kisi bhi tarah kaa massej likhane se inkaar kiya he
 However, other officials in the group are confirming that this message was done on their behalf, but it has also been deleted later

 The Jodhpur court has asked the police to register an FIR against the culprits who make such objectionable and casteist remarks, so no criminal case will be made against the RSS chief as it is not his official account

 unke anusaar kai jagah yah galat khabar chal rahi he ki ambedkar ke khilaaf unhone aapattijanak twit kiye the
 He made it clear that this tweet was not from his side but from a fake account

 Also, they cannot say anything which hurts the feelings of any community

 Rahul Gandhi, who is targeting PM Modi regarding the surgical strike, is seen as a political attacker
 rahul ne guuruuvaar shaam ko kaha tha ki piem modi shaheedon ke khun kii dallali kar rahe hai
 Following this statement of the Congress vice president, the Aam Aadmi Party along with BJP has also become an attacker on Rahul Gandhi
 amit shah ne shuukravaar ko press conference kar rahul or congress par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 So far, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, who is seeking proof of surgical strike from PM Modi, also lashed out at Rahul
 upi main 27 saal baad satta vaapasi kii koshish main juty congress ke yuvaraj 21 din pehle devaria se shuru hui kisaan yatra puri kar dilli pahunche the
 But as soon as he reached the capital, he made a dung by giving this statement
 upi main sabhaaon ke dauraansargical strikke liye sena or centre sarkaar kii tarif karne vaale rahul gandhi kaa nayaa daanv congress ke liye baari pad saktaa he
 The BJP reminded the Congress what has happened to them after such statements of its leaders in the past
 kabhi 'maut kaa saudagar'javaanon kii shahadat ke sandarbh main 'dallali' shabd kaa istemaal kiye jane se bijepi bhadak gai he
 The party hit back at Rahul's statement, saying that the Congress would have to bear the brunt of it
 2007 main gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan sonia gandhi ne narendra modi ko 'maut kaa saudagar' kaha tha
 Modi was the CM of Gujarat at that time
 sonia gandhi navsari main chunavi raily main kaha tha, 'gujarat kii sarkaar chalaane vaale jhuthe, beyimaan, maut ke saudagar hai
 Modi responded to these allegations of Sonia in the election rally itself that the merchants of death are those who attacked the Parliament
 congress party un logon ko faansee kii sajaa se bachaa rahi he
 This statement of Sonia caused a huge loss to the Congress and the BJP again formed the government in the state

 Sometimes 'poison farming' During the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, Rahul Gandhi accused Modi of cultivating poison

 Because whenever strong words have been used against Modi by Congress leaders, it has turned upside down

 Rahul Gandhi, who went on an election trip in UP, said after the surgical strike that PM Modi has done a good job for the first time in two years
 congress netaa sanjay nirupam ne sargical strike ko farji bataaya to congress ne nirupam ke bayaan se kinaaraa kar liya tha
 But Rahul's latest statement has surprised even political pundits with a 'u-turn' in the Congress's stand on the issue of surgical strikes in pok
 rahul ne kaha kya?kisaan yatra kii samaapan raily main rahul ne kaha, 'hamaare javaanon ne jammu-kashmir main apana khun diya he
 He has conducted surgical strikes for Hindustan

 14 may ko baba barphani kaa aakaar 16 feet tha, maheene bhar main ye ghatakar 9 feet rah gaya or ab ye mahaj kunch inch kaa rah gaya he
 Baba Barfani will be disappointed with the devotees who are going to visit now
 kyon ruuth gaye hai baba barphani?aakhir kyon amarnath kii pavitra gupha se antardhyaan ho gaye bhole bhandari
 Why Shivling melted in about two weeks
 dharm main aasthaa rakhane waalon ke liye ye ek bada sawaal he
 But according to scientists, this year Amarnath has got more heat than previous years, due to which the Shivling of snow melted
 aasthaa kii amarnath gupha ko jane vaale raste sookhe or sapaat dikhaai dene lage hai
 Usually, snow was visible on these paths at this time, but this time there is not even a trace of snow
 aasthaa kii is gupha main is baar kai shraddhaluon ke jane kii ummid jataai ja rahi he, aise main yatra shuru hone ke baad bhakton ke alaava gupha ke aas-paas badi taadaad main suraksha karmi bhi maujuud hai
 The temperature around the Amarnath cave rose further due to the huge crowds, although the Shrine Board claimed that in the last two-three years they have taken some measures that do not raise the cave temperature
 jab 14 may 2013 ko baba barphani ne pehali baar darshan die the tab shivlinga kaa aakaar 16 feet kaa tha
 And slowly it melted completely
 lekin ye pehla mauka nahin he jab baba barphani pehali baar apane bhakton se ruthe hon, isse pehle bhi aisa ho chukaa he
 Baba Barfani has been reduced to 9 feet from 16 feet in 2013
 2012 main shivlinga kaa aakaar 22 feet se ghatakar 14 feet gaya tha
 In 2011, Baba Barfani of 16 feet appeared, which melted to 4 feet in just 5 days
 2010 main 12 feet ke shivlinga kaa aakaar pighalkar pehle 6 feet hua, or baad main 3 feet ho gaya tha
 Amarnath Yatra started on 28th June with devotees disappointed due to Baba Barfani's intervention
 lakhon bhakt baba barphani ke darshan ke liye nikle, lekin do hafton main hi amarnath gupha ko chhod gaye mahadev, jabaki amarnath yatra 21 agast tak jari rahegi
 In such a situation, the devotees are surprised how they will celebrate Ruth Nath in the holy cave
 abhi tak kareeb dhai lakh bhakt barphani baba ke darshan kar chuke hai, jabaki saadhe teen lakh bhakt amarnath pahunch sakate hai
 Everyday thousands of devotees are visiting Baba Barfani in the holy cave, but for the first time devotees are feeling the displeasure of Mahadev in the holy cave
 darshan karke laute bhakt bataate he ki mahadev kaa antardhyaan hona unki krodhlila he
 Someone has come for the Amarnath Yatra for the first time, and someone has come many times
 baba barphani ke antardhyaan hone kii khabar se bhakt behad dukhi hai
 He will no longer be able to see the Shivling in the Amarnath cave for which he reaches after traveling so hard
 amarnath yatra par jane kii ichha ek baar har shiv bhakt ke man main hoti he, kyonki amarnath kii pavitra gupha main virajman mahadev kaa swaroop kisi chamatkaar se kam nahin he
 This form of Barfani Baba not only makes nature on its own, but in the meantime, Mahadev Mahadev comes and resides in it
 kaha jaataa he ki gupha main maujuud shivlinga ke upar boond-boond jal tapakataa he
 This Shivling is formed due to freezing of the same water
 mana jaataa he ki ye jal ramkund se tapakataa he, jo gupha ke bilkul upar he
 According to the belief, on the full moon night, the Shivalinga is in its full size and after the full moon as the size of the moon decreases, the size of the Shivalinga also decreases
 lekin amarnath main bhole bhandari aise ruthe ki pahaado par pad rahi garmi se mahadev pehle hi antardhyaan ho gaye
 The Meteorological Department also believes that there is a sudden increased heat behind the melting of the Shivling
 dharm se jude log maanate hai ki mausam kaa achaanak garm hona mahadev kaa krodh hi he
 The rains stopped the devotees at the beginning of the first journey and now Mahadev himself left the holy cave, which means that Nath's displeasure has not gone away

 The airport is fully ready, let us tell you that 6 years ago in Bikaner, former Union Aviation Minister Praful Patel laid the foundation stone of this airport and said to start this airport in two years
 der se hi sahi lekin chaar saal baad ye orport puri tarah ban kar taiyaar hua he yani civil orport ke terminal, ranve, parking or moolbhoot suvidhaon samet sari taiyaariyaan puri hai
 The airport, built at a cost of crores of rupees, was inaugurated by the Chief Minister and the Union Aviation Minister on 29 June 2014
 ise karodo rupee kii lagat se taiyaar karavaaya gaya, jisamen sabhi tarah kii suvidhaayen uplabdh hai
 The biggest thing is that its runway is different because Bikaner's civil airport has a very large runway because of its connection to the air force
 vahiin aam janata ko bhi is orport ke shuru hone kaa besabri se intjaar tha jo aaj jaakar puraa hua
 The people of Jaisalmer too have now hoped that air service will start from here as well and the entire desert will connect to other parts of the country
 pakistan kaa nyaayik itihaas is desh ke rajnatik itihaas jaisaa hi pabandon se pata padaa he
 The institution that started in a secular and impartial manner as the bearer of the British tradition of justice has today been politicized and denominated in the race for power
 bas aupniveshik dinon ke kuch paband bache rah gaye hai (jaise ki ham ab bhi jajon ko ''maai lord'' yaa ''yor lordship'' kah kar sambodhit karte hai)
 The development of Pakistan's judiciary has to be seen in the context of three other pillars of the institutional structure here - Parliament / Executive, Military and Religion
 nayaa ganraajya banane ke shuruaati varshon main nyaaypalika kaa secular or aadhunik charitra uske die kai aitihaasik faislon se apane aap spasht hota he, jaisaa ki usne 1953 main punjab ke asthir halaat kii jaanch karne ke liye punjab act-hyahya, 1954 ke tahat gathit court of inkvyri kii kaarywahi ke maamle main diya tha
 Behind the Punjab situation, there were some political parties working on a religious basis, such as majlis-e-ahrar and jamaat-e-islami
 inaki jaden 1946 ke chunaav main maujuud thim jisamen in partiyon ne muslim lig kii sarkaar ko musiibat main daalane ke liye ahmadiya musalamaanon kaa virodh kiya tha
 The targets of these Islamic parties were the members of the Muslim League Cabinet and the then Foreign Minister Sir Zafarullah Khan who was Ahmadiyya
 court of inkvyri ne apni sunwaayee kaaphi vistaar or vyapak tareeke se kii jisamen do nyaayadhishon justise munir or justise kayaani ne islam kii takreeban har dhara ke muslim vidwaanon se baatcheet kii
 The findings of this investigation report are extremely interesting: 1
 mohammad ali jinna ne pakistan ko secular rajya banane kii kalpana kii thi
 2
 islamirajya kii avadharana ek marichika he jiskaa peechha karnaa vyarth he
 3
 musalmaan koun he, isaki koi saarvbhaumik paribhaasha nahin he isliye taarkik aadhaar par yah tay karnaa rajya kaa kaam nahin hona chahie
 4
 punjab kaa asantosh muslim lig sarkaar ko musiibat main daalane ke liye kshetreey netaaon dwaara kii gai bhadakaau raajnneeti kaa nateeja tha
 Today, no such judicial report can be imagined when Pakistan has established a narrative of the Islamic State ideologically behind its establishment and constitutionally declared Ahmadiyya Muslims as non-muslims
 pakistan main loktantr ko pehla jhtka tamizuddin maamle (mukadmaa pieldi 1955 epasi 240) main laga tha, jisase vahaan kii nyaaypalika ne sakriy rup se nibatane kii koshish bhi kii
 But the matter turned such that Jamriyat continued to decline in this country since then
 yah maamla jahaan jaakar palata, vah bindu darasal takneekee tha
 In 1954, Governor General of Pakistan Ghulam Mohammad dissolved the Constituent Assembly and replaced it with a Council of Ministers
 samvidhan sabha ke adhyaksh tamizuddin khan ne is karrwai ke khilaaf sindh hycourt main government of india act, 1935 kii dhara 223 e ke tahat ek yachika daayar kar di
 Actually, the legislature of Pakistan adopted section 223A for writ in the High Court, but an appeal was filed in the Federal Court against this writ
 court ne british samrajya or rashtrakul deshon main lagu samvidhanon kii padtaal karne ke baad vyavastha di ki chunki dhara 223 e par pakistan ke governor general kii muhar nahin lagi thi, lihaaja hycourt main yah rit amaanya he
 This is followed by the Doso case in reference to the validity of marginal crime regulation in Balochistan (PLD 1958 SC 553)
 ise yah kehete hue chunauti di gai thi ki vah 1956 ke samvidhan ke adhikaar kshetra se baahar kii cheez he or vah anivaaryta ke siddhant kii jameen taiyaar karata he (jo tab se lekar ab tak desh ke sanvaidhanik itihaas ke saath plig kii tarah chipta he)
 The Supreme Court upheld the coup by General Ayub Khan of the government elected through this decision and laid the basis for Kavlson's doctrine of revolution and judicial activism, which described the revolution as a legitimate way to replace the government 
 general ayub khan kaa maananaa tha ki sansadeey loktantr pakistan kii janata ke liye upyukt nahin he or desh main raashtrapati shashan hona chahie jahaan ganraajya ke raashtrapati kaa chunaav ''basic democrate'' kahalaane vaale matadaataaon kaa samooh karegaa
 This system of Basic Democracy was in fact a mask to maintain the erstwhile feudal system as the Basic Democrats were to be elected from amongst the stalwarts of rural areas who would inevitably support the status quo
 1962 main ayub khan ne is vyavastha ko lagu kar diya lekin bangladesh kii aazaadee ke dauraan 1969 se 1971 ke bich ke asthir varshon main yah samvidhan or iske praavdhaan dafan ho gaye
 Once again, parliamentary democracy was restored in Pakistan
 doso faisle ko asamaa jilani ke maamle main (mukadmaa pieldi 1972 essi 139) palat diya gaya jisamen kavlson ke kranti ke siddhant ko avaidh kanoonee siddhant tehra diya gaya
 Unfortunately, the verdict lasted only a few days as the coup of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's elected government by General zia-ul-haq was once again validated in the Nusrat Bhutto case (litigation PLD 1977 SC 657), through the doctrine of compulsion
 pehali baar is siddhant ko takhtapalat ke maamle main kot kiya gaya tha, lekin prabhavi taur par dekhen to yah kavlson ke siddhant kaa hi ek sanskaran tha
 In 1979, the case of the judicial assassination of Zulfir Ali Bhutto came into the hands of the judiciary itself
 general jiya ul haq ko apana shashan vaid tehraane ke liye islam kii jarurat thi, lihaaja 1980 main raashtrapati kii ore se jari ek adhyadesh ke raste sangheey sharia adaalat kaa gathan kar diya gaya
 It was later incorporated into the Constitution as the eighth amendment of the Constitution
 sharia adaalat aaj nyaaypalika ke samanaantar apana kaam kar rahi he jo sharia se jude maamalon ko dekhati he
 The failure of other institutions to challenge the establishment of this institution has established a law and constitutionally religious system in Pakistan
 rajya main islam kii bhoomika ke barakes nyaaypalika ke charitra main in buniyadi badlaavon kaa asar hamen sharmasaar karne vaale do aitihaasik faislon main dekhne ko miltaa he-kajalbash vakf maamla (pieldi 1990 essi 99) or jahiruddin maamla (1993 essiemr 1718)
 The decision in the Kajalbash Waqf case invalidated land reform on the basis of Islam, while in Zaheeruddin v
 State, the court legalized the constitutionally defined Muslims to commit violence against non-muslims or Ahmadis rejected in the constitution

 It was witness to the tussle between democratically elected governments and the judiciary of Gir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif when the judiciary gave decisive status to the seniority order of judges in the Al Jehad Trust case (PLD 1996 SC 324) and restored judicial independence Redefining 'consultation' with the Chief Justice in appointing High Court and Supreme Court judges in such a way that he would be vetoed Got travel rights

 When Musharraf carried out the third military coup in 1999, once again the judiciary not only validated it but also gave Musharraf the right to amend the constitution
 agle aath saal tak nyaaypalika yahaan faujee shaasha kii muhar kaa purana kaam karti rahi lekin tasviir us vakt badali jab 2007 main mukhya nyaayadhish iftikhar choudhary ne dabaav ke baavjood istipha dene se manaa kar diya jiske baad tathakthith ''vakeelon kaa andolan'' bhadak gaya
 On March 16, 2009, Chief Justice Chaudhary was reinstated by the democratically elected government of former Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani to his post and from here the latest between the judiciary and the executive of Pakistan over the infamous NRO case (PLD 2010 SC 265) Rust broke out
 enarao maamla neshnal ricancyliation ordinance, 2007 se judaa tha jo kuch mahatvapurn logon ko puraane adalati maamalon se riyaayat detaa tha, jisamen raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari kaa bhi naam tha
 The Supreme Court repealed the ordinance and ordered the then Prime Minister of Pakistan to write a letter to Swiss bank officials urging him to open an old case against Zardari
 gilaani ne aisa karne se yah kehete hue inkaar kar diya ki aisa kadam samvidhan kii dhara 248(2) ke tahat ganraajya ke raashtrapati ko mili chhot kaa ulanghan hoga
 This led to the Supreme Court ending its membership of the Prime Minister's National Assembly in 2012 and effectively instituting a judicial coup against a democratically elected prime minister

 h Ashraf has also refused to accept the Supreme Court order
 dekhnaa hoga ki ve supreme court kii maar se aane vaale dinon main batch pate hai yaa phir unhen bhi aane vaale dinon main apana boria-bistar sametanaa pad jayega
 Barring a few exceptions, the judiciary of Pakistan has been a reactionary body overall, which has no precedent to give in the name of protection or promotion of civil rights
 iske ulat isane faujee takhtapalat ko vaid tehraaya he, pradhanmantriyon ko barkhaast kiya or suuli par latakaaya he, majahabi aazaadee ko dafna diya he, aay or bhoomi ke punarvitaran kii raah main roda atakaya he or pakistan main alpsankhyakon ke utpeedan ke morche par sabase aage rahi he
 In recent years, the judiciary has become more confident and that is why it has emerged as a real threat to democracy in Pakistan

 vahiin is firestar holdings limited ko modi kii bharat sthit company firestar international limited dekhati he
 Most shares of Firestar International Limited are owned by Modi Modi
 vahiin honkong sthit firestar holding ke paas neerav modi kii euke or honkong main sthit teenon companiyon main mejority shares hai
 That is, Nirav Modi Limited in UK and Firestar Diamond Limited and Nirav Modi Limited in Hong Kong
 dastavej se pataa chalata he ki neerav modi kii teenon vidashi companiyon main top management main chupchaap dhang se bada badlaav kiya ja rahaa ho saktaa he
 The big reason behind this may be the discovery of Nirav Modi by stirring around the world
 company filings se pataa chalata he ki in companiyon ne jin deshon main ye kaam kar rahi hai, vahaan ke niamakon (regulators) ko suchit kar diya he ki ellicock ko iklaute diarector ke taur par niyukt kiya gaya he
 UK House was informed of the appointment of Allycock on 20 March
 iske 9 din baad honkong main adhikariyon ko bhi aisi hi soochna di gai
 According to the document, American citizen Elliock is residing in New Jersey
 euke sthitineerav modilimited main abhi tak teen nideshak the- angelina un, mihir bhansaali or ajay gandhi
 His permanent address is in Hong Kong
 5 march ko istife se pehle un euke main neerav modi limited main nideshak hone ke saath honkong sthit neerav modi limited or bharat main firestar international limited main bhi nideshak thim
 Nirav Modi himself is also a director in India-based Firestar International Limited
 vahiin mihir bhansaali kaa naam modi kii america sthit company firestar diamond ink ke iklaute nideshak ke taur par darj he
 On whose behalf an application for bankruptcy action has been filed in New York court
 isi tarah ajay gandhi firestar diamond ink kaa siio / siefo he
 Both Gandhi and Bhansali resigned from the company board of uk-based Nirav Modi Limited on 9 March
 honkong sthit firestar diamond main ellicock ke iklaute nideshak banane se pehle tak bankim mehta kaa naam bhi is company ke nideshak ke taur par darj tha
 Whether there is any change in the shareholding structure of any of these companies will be known only when the annual return is filed on their behalf
 swatantra rup se kaam karne vaale dilli sthit company secretary ravi bhushan ne india today ko bataaya, aisa lagata he ki bharat kaa sarvaadhik vaanchit jewalthief neerav modi euke or honkong sthit apni sampattiyon ko surakshit karne ke liye ye sab kar rahaa ho
 Similar tactics are generally adopted by businesses to avoid investigations by law enforcement agencies
 neerav modi jab apane thikaane badalata bhaag rahaa he, aise main ek america naagarik ko teen videshi companiyon kaa iklauta nideshak chune janaa khud hi andeh khadey karata he
 Apart from this, the time chosen for the change in top management in companies is also doubtful as Firestar Diamond Inc
 has already filed an appeal for bankruptcy action
 is apil se judy bikri sunwaayee new york main 15 april ko tay he
 The auction will be held on May 3

 banduukon kaa munh ab kutton kii taraf gum gaya he
 In fact, news was coming from Sitapur area of uttar Pradesh that some dogs have become man-eating there and they are targeting the children of the area
 chah maheene main 12 bacchon kii maut ho chuki thi
 Just after this, the UP Police is encircling the gangsters in the same way as humans are doing in the name of criminals
 haalanki ye ab bhi saaf nahin ho paa rahaa he ki bacchon kaa shikaar karne vaale kute hi hai yaa phir koi or?upi police, ek saal, 1800 encountergazab goliyaan ugal rahi hai upi main bandooken
 No FIA
 naa mukadmaa
 No arrest
 naa daleel, naa vakil
 No debate
 sidhe sadak par faisla
 1800 encounters throughout the year
 50 se zyada dher
 Over 300 injured
 ye to rahi insaanon ke encounter kii baat
 But what will it be called? Because the UP police is the same
 bandooken bhi vahi
 Same bullets
 bas nishaanaa badal gaya he
 Here, instead of criminals, loyal animals are dogs on the target of police bullets
 encounter ke liye vishesh timpulice kii special team banaai gai
 Raids are being conducted from place to place
 drone camere se chappe-chappe par nazar rakhi ja rahi he
 The telescope is keeping news of every action
 ghanton lambii-lambii muthbhed chal rahi hai
 This is being done in search of the slaughter of 12 children
 kairabad main kutton kaa aatankapulice kii special team ne aakhirkaar muthbhed ke baad 12 bacchon kaa qatl karne vaale giroh ke ek sadsy yani kute ko encounter main maar giraaya
 Yes, after the encounter of miscreants in UP, the need for a dog encounter has come up because the police believe that these dogs have become man-eating
 bas isiilie upi police in kutton ko 12 bacchon kaa kaatil maanakar zile main oparation dog encounter chalaa rahi he
 12 children become hunted in 6 months
 Since November, till now in about 6 months, dogs have made 12 innocent children their prey here
 jinamein se 6 bacchon ko to sirf may ke shuruuaati hafte main hi jaan ganvaani padi
 Himanshi and Sonam became victims of dogs in November
 janvari main kutton ne mubin ko apana shikaar banaaya
 In February, innocent omen were killed in dog attacks
 march main arbaz or sania par jaanaleva hamalaa hua
 And so far in May, dogs were hunted down by Shawni, Khalid, Komal, Geeta, Virendra and Kasim
 behad ajeeb si hai ye ghatnaayen
 Sudden man-eating of street dogs is shocking
 bas isiilie jitani munh utani baaten ho rahi hai
 Contradicting the statements of the officials, the SP of Sitapur says that dogs are not getting meat, so they are biting humans
 par sawaal ye he ki boojadkhaane to puure upi main band hai
 So why only the dogs of Sitapur are angry? And admittedly, these dogs are angry about not getting food
 to phir ye bacchon ke gardan par sirf hamalaa kar bhaag kyon jate hai? pashu kalyaan adhikari saurabh gupta kaa kahana he ki agar wo kute aadamkhor ho gaye hai to, un kutton ne keval kaata kyon, khaaya kyon nahin?junglee aadamkhor shikari kute!aisa nahin he ki gali ke kute aadamkhor nahin ho sakate
 But this happens only if they lose their mind balance
 par ek saath jhund kaa jhund pagal ho jaae ye bhi to mumkin nahin he
 So the question is, is there anything that the village dogs are considering as someone else? Because no one is saying this about the attack dogs being dogs
 ek chashmadid mahila kaa kahana he ki kute kii tarah the magar ajeeb the
 Some villagers say that dogs who are attacking children
 wo unki gali ke kute nahin balki kheton or baagon main chhupakar rahane vaale bahari shikari kute hai
 Those who have high speed of escape and are very dangerous
 bakriyaan or gaay bhi baniin shikarsitapur ke khayrabad ke 10 kimi ke daayre main jitne bhi gaanv hai, vahaan aatank machaa haa he
 According to the villagers, not only children but also cows and goats are being hunted
 saikadon kii taadaad main bakriyon or darjanon kii taadaad main gaay par in kutton ne jaanaleva hamalaa kiya he
 One officer says the attackers may not be wolves
 hamalavar kute hai yaa koi or?dehshat kaa alam ye he ki bacchon ne skool janaa chhod diya he
 Farmers have stopped going to the fields
 or jo ja bhi rahe hai, wo machaan ke upar chadhe baithe hai
 But the question is, are the attackers really dogs? Or someone else? It is important to get to the bottom of this terror

 BJP has won the second major political battle in a year
 2017 kii shuruyaat main uttar pradesh ke chunaav hue the
 There the BJP had won a big victory, after which the party has again won power in the assembly elections held in Gujarat
 lagaataar chhathin baar gujarat main bijepi satta par kabiz hui he
 However, the Congress has also done a bang
 yahi kaaran he ki bijepi kii yah sarkaar siton ke hisaab se sabase kam hogi
 Let's look at the 11 issues that should be the main reason for bjp's victory
 1
 In 2014 elections, Narendra Modi won the Lok Sabha elections more than UP
 iske baad aisa pehali baar hua jab bijepi ne kisi rajya ke liye itani mehnat kii
 If you look at the figures, the BJP under Modi's leadership campaigned for Gujarat in such a big way
 gujarat kii sabhi 182 siton ko modi ne chune kii koshish kii
 Modi held 34 rallies in Gujarat
 gaur karen to upi main bhi modi ne sirf 24 reliyaan hi kii thim
 2
 modi magic barkarargujrat chunaav ke nateezon ne ek baar phir sabit kar diya ki desh main modi kii lahar kam nahin hui he
 Modi once again campaigned on his own
 puraa chunaav bijepi ne modi ke chehre ko saamne karke ladaa
 Stringent decisions like gst-demonetisation, despite the resentment of Gujarat businessmen, people voted in Modi's name
 3
 Gujarat's Ashmita bets Modi's bets on Gujarat Asmita to end the Congress campaign's hype, the Patel agitation and people's displeasure
 unhone apni reliyon main lagaataar gujarat kii izzat kii baat uthaai
 With this, the local voters once again leaned towards BJP
 4
 Not giving up OBC is beneficial for BJP BJP did not show much havoc in the last two years amid Patidar agitation in Gujarat
 do saal pehle gujarat main bade paimaane par andolan, hinsa ke baad bhi bijepi ne sidhe patidaaron kii baat nahin maani
 Anandiben Patel also stepped down as CM but several months after the agitation
 kaha jaataa he ki iske peeche kaa bada ganit tha
 The BJP did not want to stand with the Patidars and annoy the obcs
 5
 Ram temple mention: In Gujarat elections, BJP again returned to the issue of Hindutva and Ram temple
 upi chunaav ke baad bijepi netaaon ne lagaataar ram mandir kaa mudda uthaaya
 This benefited the party in Gujarat, once a laboratory of Hindutva
 isi bich disambar ke shuruaati main supreme court main ram mandir maamle kii phir se sunwaayee shuru hui, vahaan congress netaa or is maamle main ek paksh ke vakil kapil sibbal ne bayaan diya tha- ram mandir maamle ko 2019 tak taal dena chahie
 BJP is trying to take advantage of this
 ise modi ne apane reliyon main uthaaya
 Said- Congress leaders do not want Ram temple to be built
 6
 For the first time in 22 years, Rahul Gandhi campaigned so much by the faceless Congress Congress
 party karyakartaon ke bich ummid bhi dikhaai
 But the Congress has no face in Gujarat, which the locals can remember
 sthaneey str ke congress netaaon se zyada charchit hardik patel kaa cheharaa tha jo ki chunaav nahin lard rahe the
 Even though people trusted Rahul Gandhi, he did not show any face as CM, which they should vote on
 7
 Gujarati vs Hindi Gujarati vs Hindi was also a big factor in this election
 2014 ke baad desh-videsh main lagaataar zyaadaatar maukon par hindi main bhaashan dene vaale piem narendra modi ne gujarat main gujarati ko chunaa
 He continued to hold his rallies in Gujarati
 na sirf unhone gujarati main spich di balki kuccha, bharuch jaise ilaakon main sthaneey boliyon main logon se sampark kiya
 It got some benefit somewhere
 vahiin, rahul gandhi gujarati nahin jaanate the, iske kaaran ve lagaataar hindi main hi logon se judane kii koshish karte rahe
 8
 patel vot main sendhahardik patel ne aarakshan ke liye patidaar andolan khadaa kiya
 a large number of youth came with him
 patel samudaay kaaphi had tak bijepi ke khilaaf khadaa ho gaya
 But just before the election, the BJP on several occasions weakened the Patel movement as well as Hardik
 hardik ke kai karibiyon jaise reshma patel jaise netaaon ko bijepi ne apni party main shaamil kara liya
 This created a dent in Patel votes
 bijepi ne 182 main se 52 patidari chehron ko tikat diya

 21 june ko vishwa antarrashtriya yoga diwas manaaya jayega
 The General Assembly of the United Nations has passed this proposal of Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi in a record time of less than 90 days
 193 main se 177 sadasyon ne vishwa yoga diwas manaae jane ko lekar apni sahmati di he
 At this stage, the general consensus on yoga shows how much yoga has taken global form even before the World Day is over
 isse pehle jab mahatma gandhi ke janmdin par bharat ne ahimsa diwas manaane kaa prastaav pesh kiya tha, tab 140 deshon ne hi samarthan kiya tha
 Yoga does not need recognition, nor is it spread through advertising, yet crores of people, including India, are happy on this happy occasion
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi apni khushi saarvajanik rup se zaahir kii
 He says that yoga has the potential to bring the whole human society together
 yah gyaan, karm or bhakthi kaa behad sundar sangam he
 Yoga is India's old brand ambassador
 aaj se nahin, dashakon se
 It has been contributed by many small and big yoga gurus who propagated it on the strength of their perseverance and practice and through it provided health benefits to millions of people
 yoga ke bheetar kii duniya bhi kaaphi badali he
 It is not that the aspect of cultivation has weakened, but Yoga has become a Yoga of English and has also changed into a packaging
 yoga guru ke naam par kai log raajnneetik laabh bhi lene lage hai
 Yet there is also yoga knowledge and quick solution according to today's life
 aisa koi desh nahin hoga, jahaan kisi yoga guru dwaara sthapit yoga centre na ho
 On social media, many people are ridiculing those who oppose right-wing politics
 dharmik sankeernata kii raajnneeti kaa virodh karne kaa matlab kaise ho gaya ki wo vyakti dharm yaa yoga kaa bhi virdohi hoga
 Someone wrote what the secularists will do now
 darasal ye wo log hai, jo yoga ko kisi raajnneetik rup se sangathit dharm ke daayre se baahar dekhnaa hi nahin chaahate
 They add themselves to the opposition of yoga against the narrow mentalities of those who do politics in the name of Hinduism
 shaayad pradhanmantri ke is kadam se yoga dharm or uske prati sankeern samaj se baahar nikal sakegaa
 Misconceptions about yoga have also been spread here politically
 yah sab he or rahegaa, lekin yoga ko har dharm ke logon ne apanaaya he
 United Arab Emirates, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Bangladesh have supported India's proposal
 soshal media par yoga ke samarthak hone ke naam par jo log anya logon par sawaal uthaa rahe hai, unhen yah tathy bhi dekhnaa chahie or kahana chahie ki yoga main wo vaishvik gun he, jise log dharm ke chashme se baahar jaakar dekh sakate hai
 Even before and now there is more yoga religion or, say, free from the realm of the temple and has taken it globally
 yoga ek vichaar pranali he
 Today, the way in which an organized form of religion is formed and that organized form has started to be identified in a political way, yoga does not fit into it
 varna yoga bhi karmkaandon se bharaa rahata
 But this is a means of interviewing myself
 china, rus, france, america, england, brazil, cuba, germany, japan, mexico, nepal, spain ne bhi bharat ke is prastaav kaa samarthan kiya he
 Those who see this success of India through the prism of the pride of religion should demonstrate global generosity on this occasion
 aisa nahin he ki bharat ko sanyukt raashtra main yah koi pehali kamyaabi mili he
 Earlier, on the initiative of India, the General Assembly of the United Nations passed a resolution on June 15, 2007 and decided to celebrate October 2 every year as World non-violence Day
 tab is prastaav ko pesh karte hue us samay ke videsh rajya mantri anand sharma ne kaha tha ki bharat ke prastaav ko 140 deshon ne samarthan kiya he
 This proves how much respect Mahatma Gandhi has around the world and his philosophy is relevant even today
 anand sharma ne kaha tha ki ahimsa duniya kii mahanatam shakti he
 Then this success was also projected as the great success of India, which we have forgotten today
 itnaa bhul chuke hai ki gandhi ke hatyare ko rashtrabhakt bataane lagate hai
 The number of days of the United Nations is such that hardly anyone can remember
 sanyukt raashtra kii website par jaakar ginaney laga, to yah sankhya 121 ho jaati he
 The Yoga Day celebrated on 21 June is 121st
 sabase zyada vishwa diwas march or june maheene main manaae jate hai
 Fifteen days in these two months, one or the other day is celebrated
 usee tarah april or oktober main 14 din, november main 13 din, november main 13 din, may or disambar main 11 din koi na koi antarrashtriya diwas hota he
 The shortest is one in January and then 5 days in February
 13 farvari ko radio diwas, to 30 april ko antarrashtriya jaiz diwas manaaya jaataa he
 Mother tongue day is observed on 21 February, then English Day on 23 April
 21 march ko vishwa kavita diwas manaaya jaataa he
 March 20 is also observed as the International Day of Happiness
 bimariyon main malaria, cancer, tapedic ke naam se bhi antarrashtriya diwas darj hai
 International Nelson Mandela Day is celebrated on 18 July
 sanyukt raashtra kii website se pataa chalaa ki is din 67 minute kisi duusare ke madad main dene hote hai
 Hopefully, you must have done half of it
 bharat in dinon parmaanu pareekshan par bahut gaurav karata he, lekin shaayad hi koi netaa bataata ho ki sanyukt raashtra 29 agast ko parmaanu pareekshan virdohi diwas manaata he
 We understand the formalities of these days
 phir bhi gandhi ke baad yoga ke naam par sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main mili is kamyaabi ko andekha nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Who would not like to see Gandhi and Yoga smiling in the list of 121 days

 menka gandhi ne kaha he ki desh main kisi bhi tarah kaa shoshan bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 The government has taken the initiative to launch 'she box' on social media, in which a victim of exploitation can complain
 aise maamalon main tatkaal karrwai kii jaaegi
 Maneka said that voice should also be raised against exploitation in the country and a campaign should be started called 'me Too India', in which if any woman is a victim of exploitation at any stage, she should complain to us and we will investigate the matter

 Whom the accident with the five-year-old doll has not allowed to sleep, 'alok, write something on the pain of the doll

 26 july 2015, kokilaben aspataal andheri kaa room number 14011, subah ke kareeb 11 baje
 This order will be the time of my last meeting, i did not know
 mujhe kamare main aata dekh unki neem behoshee tuuti
 We laughed
 saath naashtaa kiya
 On seeing the desperation of the room, it turned into poetry and poetry
 meri ek puraani romantic ghazal par unka dil atka hua tha
 Where is the sight on the floors nowadays, what you have become today 
 
 uski tarj banane lage
 Those who know the order brother know that as soon as a tune, some pattern came in his mind, he would immediately record it on his mobile
 is baar mere mobile ko bhi unki is tarj ko record karne kaa mauka mila
 Sitting on the bed, he composed the tune of Ghazal and recorded it on mobile
 nurse bhi hatprabh thi, boli, 'kalakaar ko bas kala mil jaae, duniya kii koi dawa nahin chahie phir
 Somebody would believe that just a little while ago, how did he become insensitive? The medicine of Adesh Bhai's artist was really his art

 As long as they live with the help of the same and now they will remain alive with their music in our memories

 Amen
 main jis aadesh shrivastav ko jaanata hum, meri najar main us aadesh kaa kad, uske filmi kad se kahin ooncha he
 The star of filmy life surrounded in glow
 sangeet kaa sitara
 Full of friendship, humanity, empathy and concerns
 wo ujaalaa ab nahin he
 i am returning to Delhi from Mumbai
 aaj uske sharir ko apni ankhon ke saamne dhun-dhun kar jalte dekha he
 The yellow flames are lost in the blue sky

 He is still lukewarm sitting on the seat next to the ship

 The issue of national security has come to the center of politics ever since the Indian Air Force carried out an attack on terror bases in Pakistan
 iskaa loksabhaa chunaavon main kya asar padegaa in sabhi baton par charchaa karne ke liye ajtak ne aaj vishesh ‘suraksha sabha’ kaa aayojan kiya he
 In this, Marxist Communist Party (CPM) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury raised questions about security while speaking on the topic 'how safe are we'
 'kitne surakshit hai ham' vishay par yechuri ne kaha ki, "aatankwaad or suraksha kii baat aaj agenda par kyon aa rahi he? balakot ke baad kyon aa rahi he? aantarik suraksha or aatankwaad ko hameshaa se gambhir mudda he
 The security of the nation is always the issue
 sirf chunaav ke liye nahin he
 "comparing these points with the facts," Yechury said, "compare these 5 years from the 5 years of 2009 to 2014, there were 626 terrorist attacks in these 5 years compared to the first 5 years
 un 5 saalon main 139 jawan shahid hue jabaki in 5 saalon main 483 jawan shahid hue
 Incidents of ceasefire which occurred 563 in the first 5 years, more than 5000 ceasefires have been violated in these 5 years
 "yechuri ne desh kii suraksha ke bare main kaha ki rashtriya suraksha kaa masalaa pulavama or balakot ke baad hi mudda kyon? uske baad hamaare itane sainik shahid hue, kitne aatanki hamale hue, jammu ke andar aatanki hamale hue
 What is our alertness? The question should be whether we are safe or not? Apart from the army, if it is a matter of security, should it be that our provider is safe or not? Our unemployed are walking around for help, is it safe? If you will limit all matters of security to one Balakot and you are talking about contesting elections on the basis of this, then it is an injustice to the biggest country

 Today is Parshuram Jayanti
 har saal akshay tritiya(akshaya Tritiya) ke din parashuram jayanti manaai jaati he
 According to Hindu beliefs, Parashurama is the sixth incarnation of Lord Vishnu, not anyone else
 puranic kathaon main parashuram ke gusse ko lekar kai kahaniyaan prachlit hai
 It is said that Parshuram once broke a tooth of Lord Ganesha in anger
 iske alaava bhi kai aisi ghatnaayen hai jinamein parashuram ke krodh kii kahaniyaan milti hai
 It is said that all the gods and goddesses were afraid of their anger
 manyata he ki parakram ke pratik bhagwaan parashuram kaa janm chah ucch grahon ke yoga main hua, isliye vah tejasvi, ojasvi or varchasvi mahapurush bane
 The glorious and parental devotee Parashurama cut the throat of the mother on the orders of the father, while asking the father to give him the boon of raising the mother
 is tarah hathi, krodhi or anyaay ke khilaaf sangharsh karne vaale parashuram kaa lakshya maanav maatr kaa hit tha
 It was Parashurama whose gestures changed the direction of the rivers
 unhone apane bal se aaryon ke shatruon kaa naash kiya
 The northern regions of the Himalayas, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Kashyap land and Arabia went and killed the enemies
 usee faras jise persia bhi kaha jaataa tha, kaa naam inke farse par kiya gaya
 He gave Indian culture a new identity in Aryan i
e
 Kashyap land area of iran and Aryak i
e
 Iraq
 gauratlab he ki persian bhashi parsia parashuram ke anuyaayi or agnipujak kehalaate hai or parashuram se inkaa sambandh joda jaataa he
 All the literature published on Lord Parshuram till now shows that Parshuram made the province by taking the area from Mumbai to Kanyakumari into 8 angles and vowed to protect it
 is pratigya ko tab ke anyaayi rajtantr ke viruddh bada jansangharsh kaha gaya
 He created an organization consisting of all the Brahmins, forest dwellers and peasants, who were stricken with kings, in which many kings were supported
 ayodhya, mithila, kaashi, kanyakubj, kaner, bing ke saath hi purv ke praanton main magadh or vaishali bhi mahasang main shaamil the jiskaa netritv bhagwaan parashuram ne kiya
 On the other hand, Parashuram fought with the Haihayas from the kings of 21 kingdoms extending across the present-day Sindh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, Lahore, Afghanistan, Kandahar, Iran and Oxiana
 sabhi 21 atyaachaari raajaaon or unke uttaradhikariyon tak kaa parashuram ne vinaash kar diya tha, taaki dobaaraa koi sir na uthaa sake
 There is a general belief about Lord Parashurama that he was going to destroy the clan of Kshatriyas, which is not completely true
 puranic kathaon ke anusaar bhi bhagwaan parashuram 'kshatriya' varna ke hantaa na hokar maatr kshatriyon ke ek kul haihay vansh kaa samul vinaash karne vaale hai
 There is also evidence of Kshatriya being written in place of Haihay in texts written after 10th century

" ' The Congress does not want to leave any chance of targeting Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 tabhi to congress ne modi ke garh main ghuskar unki pole kholane kaa jimmaa uthaa liya he
 The Congress will now conduct a 'pole-shell' campaign to surround Modi in Gujarat itself
 agle teen maheene congress modi ko alag-alag khulaason or andolanon se gheregi or ye sabit karegi ki modi ke sushasan main kai jhol hai
 The biggest question here is that if the Congress had to do the same, then why did it take so long
 modi jahaan desh bhar kaa daura karke congress par hamalaa bolte najar aa rahe hai to vahiin congress bhi modi ko bakhshane ke mood main nahin he
 The Congress has made a strategy to surround Modi in his house
 rahul gandhi ke saath baithak ke baad gujarat main agle teen maheene kaa kaarykram tay kiya gaya he jisamen modi kii vikaas yojanaon kii pole kholi jaaegi
 Congress will tell how far behind Gujarat is in education and many posts of teachers are vacant
 iske alaava congress ye bhi bataaegi ki modi ke garh main bal mrityu dar kaa aankada kya he
 The Congress will also reveal the amount of scam in NRHM in Gujarat
 saath vikaas kaa dam bharne vaale modi ke daavon main kitni sachai he is par bhi congress hallaa bolegi
 Gurudas Kamat, general secretary in-charge of Congress from Gujarat, said, “in Gujarat, we have decided that for the next three months all the workers will stay on the streets and agitate against the Modi government
 modi utane bade nahin jitna wo bataate hai
 The Congress will also surround the Gujarat government on the riots and the condition of minorities under Modi's rule
 congress puure desh ko bataaegi ki modi bahut bade sampradayik hai
 This is in complete contrast to the Congress policy that it adopted in the Gujarat assembly elections
 vahaan modi kii sampradayikta par usne bilkul bhi hamalaa nahin kiya tha
 Congress spokesperson Raj Babbar said, "modi actually wants to spread the Babri model of 1993 and the Godhra model of 2002 across the country, but it will not do
" 'itnaa hi nahin congress modi ke sibar waar kaa muqabla karne ke liye har rajya ke das-das congressiyon ko do din kii training bhi degi
 For which IT experts are being called from Bengaluru on the lines of Modi
 khud rahul do din kii is training main shirkat karenge
 It is clear that even if the Congress does not say it, it has started feeling scared of 'namo' Niya
 gujarat main baikfoot par rahi congress sarkaar modi ko unke ghar par hi gheregi, lekin sawaal yahi he ki kahin ye waar ulta na pad jaae, kyonki modi kaa to maananaa hi he ki badnaam honge to kya naam to hoga
 Petrol and diesel prices have been raised twice between May 1 and May 18
 pehle 1 may se petrol 3
 96 Rs
 / litre mahangaa hua, phir 15 may ko 3
 13 Rs
 / litre kii or badhotaree kii gayi
 That is, petrol 7 in 20 days
 09 ru prati litre yani kareeb 12 fisadi mahangaa hua
 During this period, diesel also became costlier by 5 rupees 8 paise, which is about 11 percent, while according to government figures, the prices of crude oil have increased by less than 2 percent during this period
 darasal antarashtriya or gharelu bazaar ke bich keemton kaa ye bemail rishta beete ek saal se jari he
 Especially when oil prices kept falling
 26 may 2014 ko kachche tel kii keemat 108
 05 dollars per barrel which was reduced to 64 on 18 May 2015
 79 dollar prati bairal ho gayi
 That is, in the last one year, the price of crude oil has come down by about 40 percent
 lekin is ek saal main petrol kii keemat main sirf saat fisadi kii katautee kii gayi he
 Petrol price 71 on 26 May 2014
 41 rupee prati litre thi jabaki 18 may 2015 ko petrol kii keemat 66
 29 per liter, which means a reduction of only 7%
 yahi trend deazal kii keemton main bhi dikhataa he
 Diesel price 56 on 26 May 2014
 71 rupee prati litre thi jabaki 18 may 2015 ko deazal kii keemat 52
 28 per liter, which means a reduction of only 8%
 tippaniyan Oil companies cited rising prices in the international market and rupee depreciating against the dollar
 ye sahi he ki is pichley ek saal main dollar ke mukaable rupaya kareeb 9 fisadi kamazor hua he
 However, it is also important that from November 2014 to January 2015, the Indian government increased excise duty on petrol and diesel four times
 isaki vajah se sarkari khajaane main to hazaron karod rupee kaa izapha hua lekin aam upabhoktaaon tak antarrashtriya bazaar main tel kii keemton main giravat kaa jitna phayda pahunch saktaa tha wo nahin pahunchaa
 Actually, this mismatch of prices between the international and domestic market has been going on for the last one year
 khaskar jab tel kii keemten girti raheen
 Crude oil price 108 on 26 May 2014
 05 dollar prati bairal thi jo 18 may 2015 ko ghatakar 64
 79 dollars per barrel
 yani pichley ek saal main kachche tel kii keemat kareeb 40 fisadi kam hui he
 But in this one year, the price of petrol has been cut by only seven percent
 26 may 2014 ko petrol kii keemat 71
 41 per liter while the price of petrol was 66 on 18 May 2015
 29 rupee prati litre ho gayi yani sirf 7 fisadi kii katautee
 The same trend is also seen in diesel prices
 26 may 2014 ko deazal kii keemat 56
 71 per liter while diesel price on May 18, 2015 was 52
 28 rupee prati litre ho gayi yani sirf 8 fisadi kii katautee
 The comments tel companiyon ne iske liye antarrashtriya bazaar main badi keemten or dollar ke mukaable kamjor pade rupee kaa hawala diya
 It is true that in this last one year, the rupee has weakened about 9% against the dollar
 haalanki ye bhi mahatvapurn he ki november 2014 se janvari 2015 ke bich bharat sarkaar ne petrol or deazal par excise duty main chaar baar badhotaree kii
 Because of this thousands of crores of rupees have been increased in the public exchequer, but it could not reach the common consumers as much benefit as the fall in oil prices in the international market
 lekin is ek saal main petrol kii keemat main sirf saat fisadi kii katautee kii gayi he
 Petrol price 71 on 26 May 2014
 41 rupee prati litre thi jabaki 18 may 2015 ko petrol kii keemat 66

 The Special Cell of Delhi Police said that an FIR was registered on September 3 and a case of treason has been registered under a criminal complaint on the complaint of Supreme Court lawyer Alok Srivastava seeking Shehla's arrest
 ek varisht police adhikari ne kaha, 'unke khilaaf kashmir ghati main kathith rup se sainya karrwai kii galat soochna twit karne ke liye bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 124-e(deshadroh), 153-e(dushmani ko badhaava dena), 504(jaanboojhkar shanti bhang karne ke iraade se apmaan karne) or 505 (updrav karwaane ke liye bayaan dene) ke tahat maamla darj karaayaa gaya he

 He claimed that human rights are being violated to fulfill the agenda of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Valley

 Rashid, however, said that he was ready to give evidence when the Indian Army would set up an inquiry
 bhartiya sena ne rashid ke daavon ko khaarij kar diya tha or ise 'bebuniyaad' or 'asatyaapit' bataaya tha
 After the army rejected his claims, many people accused Rashid of spreading fake news to disturb the peace in Kashmir

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator On March 8, Malaysia Airlines' Boeing 777-200 flight number MH370 flies to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 12 pm
 kul 227 musafiron or 12 kru memberon ke saath flite local time ke mutabik raat 12 baje techoff karti he
 The distance to Beijing was to be completed in six and a half hours
 yani subah saadhe chah baje ise beijing airport land par karnaa tha
 But just a few minutes after take off, the flight breaks down with ATC
 kualalampur se jab vimaan ne udaan bharaa to mausam saaf tha
 The aircraft had 227 passengers on a total of 14 countries, including 154 Chinese, 38 Malaysian four Americans and five Hindustani
 udaan bharne ke kareeb ghante bhar baad jaise hi vimaan malaysia se 150 kilometre dur dakshin china sagar ke upar pahunchataa he achaanak uskaa sampark atisi yani air trephic control se tut jaataa he
 Before the ATC lost contact, the aircraft was flying at a height of 35 thousand feet
 or sampark tuutane se pehle payalat ne atisi ko jo aakhri sandesh diya tha wo tha
 
 
 "allright Goodnight"
 iske baad achaanak vimaan laapata ho jaataa he
 It is missing that 39 aircraft and 42 ships from 12 countries have covered the area of 27,000 Kilimotor for the last six days but neither the aircraft was found nor the wreckage of the aircraft
 har koi hairaan he ki aakhir achaanak vimaan ko kya ho gaya
 The reason for the surprise is that there was no notice of any kind of disturbance in the aircraft before contact with ATC was lost
 payalat tak ne aakhri sandesh yahi diya tha ki oleraite good nite
 Then how did the plane go missing? Did all the engines of the aircraft fail suddenly? Did the plane catch fire? Or is it a terrorist incident? There are many questions, but there is not one answer
 kyonki ab tak naa to vimaan mila he or naa hi vimaan kaa malba
 By the way, a new news is coming that the American Federal Aviation Administration had alerted Malaysia Airlines officials long before this incident
 america fedral ne chetavanee di thi ki payalat kii laaparvaahee se kabhi bhi koi haadasa ho saktaa he
 In fact, a pilot of the missing plane was notorious for having fun in the cockpit with female passengers during the flight
 vimaan ke first payalat farik abdul hamid kii ek tasviir bhi jari kii gai he
 In this, the pilot is seen with South African lady Musafir
 farik par pehle bhi iljaam laga he ki udaan ke dauraan wo naa sirf flite deck par cigarette peetaa he balki techoff or landing ke dauraan bhi mahilaon ko cockpit me bitha kar rakhata he
 So is the plane missing due to the pilot's negligence? At present, the Malaysian government or the airline company is silent on this and probably this silence will continue until the plane or its debris is found
 maanviya samvednaaen kis kadar gaayab hoti ja rahi hai, ye tamilnadu ke trichi main hui ek ghatana se pataa chalata he
 Here a poor man's grandmother dies in the same tent where he had stayed
 wo shaks daadi ko dafnane ke liye sthaneey carch prashasan se apane parisar main do gaj jameen dene ke liye guhaar lagaataa he lekin uski nahin suni jaati
 He then tries to cremate the grandmother at the crematorium in the village, but the villagers do not allow it
 aakhir haar kar wo gaanv ke baahar hi sookhe patton kii chita banaakar aag laga detaa he
 The incident took place in Neruslakudi near Valadi
 45 varshiya murugesan khilone bechney ke saath kooda binane kaa bhi kaam karata he
 Murugesan had made a tent a house
 buudhvaar subah murugesan ne tambu main daadi mariyammaal ko mrit paaya
 75-year-old Mariammal had been ill for the past several days
 mausam main thandak badhane se mariyammaal kii tabiyat or kharaab ho gai or buudhvaar ko dam tod diya
 Murugesan did not have the money to carry the grandmother's body to his native place Velankanni
 aise main murugesan ne sthaneey carch prashasan se daadi ke shav ko dafnane ke liye jagah dene kaa anurodh kiya
 But the church administration did not allow the corpse to be buried in its premises
 murugesane gaanv ke shmashaan main daadi kii chita jalaane ke liye guhaar lagaai to vahaan se bhi use niraashaa hi mili
 Murugesan then set fire to the grandmother's funeral pyre outside the village
 gaanv waalon ne jab ye dekha to police ko soochna di
 Police immediately reached the spot and took the body of Karamariammalam
 tab tak shav aadha jal chukaa tha
 Then the police themselves performed the last rites with Mariammal artistry
 police ne mariyammaal kii maut ko swaabhaavik maanate hue gaanv ke prashasnic adhikari se murugesan ko mrityu pramaan patr bhi dilaayaa

 Haryana's main opposition party, the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), has demanded a criminal case against cabinet minister Anil Vij
 haryana main vipaksh ke netaa abhaya chautaala ne anil vij par mahatma gandhi kaa apmaan karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala said that Anil Vij has insulted the father of the nation, who had followed the path of non-violence throughout his life
 ham anil vij ke khilaaf FIR darj karne kii maang karte hai
 If we had a government, we would have filed a case of treason against them and put them in jail
 gauratlab he ki anil vij ne guuruuvaar ko ambala main shahid bhagat singh kii ek pratimaa kaa anaavaran karte hue kaha tha ki desh kii aazaadee kaa shrey jawaharlal nehru or mahatma gandhi ko dena sahi nahin he kyonki unhone desh ke liekoi balidaan nahin diyaahai
 Anil Vij said, 'can anyone tell us whether Nehru or Gandhi's family, while gaining independence, ever shot a bullet, ate a stick
 duusari ore lala lajpat raay ne laathiyaan khai or shahid bhagat singh hansate-hansate desh par nyochaavar ho gaye
 Therefore 'gave freedom to us without shield, without shield
 
 
 ' jaisaa gaanaa sahi nahin he kyonki aazaadee ke asli nayak lala lajpat raay or bhagat singh jaise suurama hai
 'anil Vij said that Mahatma Gandhi did go on hunger strike many times but he never went to jail to meet Rajguru, Bhagat Singh and Sukhdev nor did he pressurize the British to get them free
 is maamle par jab anil vij se baat kii gai to unhone kaha ki vah aaj bhi kehete hai ki desh ke vibhaajan ke liye us samay kii congress or congress ke netaa jimmedaar hai inakodoshmukt nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Taking a dig at the Indian National Lok Dal demanding his arrest, Anil Vij said that the leaders of the party who do not have the freedom to speak for themselves should not point fingers at others

 Natural disasters are common in a big country like India, every year in the form of thunderstorms or earthquakes and floods, they wreak havoc on public wealth
 jab tak desh sanbhalta he
 The second disaster arises
 chaahe iske kaaran kuch bhi hon lekin sachai to yah he ki desh ko har tarah se nuksaan jhelana padataa he

 The major highway there was washed away by a huge hit of water

 Technology has taught us to predict these calamities to an extent
 ab ham samay rahete jaan jate hai ki kab baadh yaa tufaan aa saktaa he
 We saw good results in Odisha when a storm named Feline caused tremendous devastation there
 lekin us tufaan ke aane ke pehle lakhon logon ko surakshit jagahon par bhej diya gaya jisase hajaaron jaane batch gayi
 This time the moment-to-moment information from satellites alerted us and millions of lives were saved
 ab ham technology kii madad se logon kii jaane bachaa sakate hai or unhen pehle se aagaah kar sakate hai
 But the big question is when will we be able to work efficiently in case of disaster management
 yah aasaan to nahin he lekin asambhav nahin he
 It is still very backward and work in this direction remains to be done
 kitni kshati hui he or uskaa kya nikaaran ho, yah jaananaa bahut jaruri he
 This is a difficult task because it is in itself a matter of guessing the damage done by a storm like this
 is disha main abhi kaam hona he
 But relief should be the first priority for the victims at war level

 Influence of Muslim voters Muslim voters have considerable influence in Aligarh Lok Sabha seat
 yahaan aligarh muslim uniwarsity hone ke kaaran yahaan ke muslim votaron kaa sandesh puure uttar pradesh main jaataa he

 There are 65 lakh male and 8 lakh female voters

 All these five seats went to the Bharatiya Janata Party's account in the 2017 assembly elections
 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ke satish gautam ne ekatarfa jeet darj kii thi
 He got a total of 48 percent of the vote, while his rival of Bahujan Samaj Party, Arvind Kumar Singh, got 21 percent of the vote

 Three members, journalist Dilip Padgaonkar, Information Commissioner MM Ansari and educationist Radha Kumar were appointed negotiators for peace in Kashmir during the tenure of Super powerupa-2, which Dineshwar Sharma received
 us samay bahut sari chijen home ministry pehle se tay karti thi
 But this time, along with making Sharma a negotiator, the government has given him a lot of powers

 iskaa matlab ye hua ki ve home secretary ko bhi nahin, balki sidhe rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar (enese) yaa pradhanmantri narendra modi ko report karenge
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh had yesterday made it clear that Dineshwar Sharma would be given complete freedom to talk to whom, when and where in Kashmir
 yani grahamantralay kaa isamen koi dakhal nahin hoga
 There is no time-limit, the government will be satisfied with how serious this time is regarding the Kashmir issue, it can also be understood that there is no fixed time-limit for submitting the report to Dineshwar Sharma
 yani jab unhen puri tasalli ho jaaegi, tab ve apni report saunpenge
 Earlier, whatever negotiators were appointed, they did not get such freedom

 The pain of not implementing the committee's report was also seen in an interview by Dilip Padgaonkar
 unhone kaha tha ki upie ne us report ko nakaar diya tha
 At the same time, the other interlocutor Radha Kumar believed that by adopting political dialogue and common minimum program, a long-term strategy can solve the problem of Kashmir
 dilip padaganvkar cameti ke teenon sadasyon ne kashmir maamle se jude sabhi steke holders se mulaakaat kii thi
 The Padgaonkar Committee, which was therefore rejected, had many recommendations ranging from reducing the army's strength in the Valley to the immediate disposal of human rights issues, talks with the Hurriyat, in the report prepared by the Padgaonkar Committee

 This step is the effect of the same thing

 Chidambaram said that it is clear from the decision of the Modi government that he has accepted the hardening mistake so far
 ab tak jo baatcheet bilkul nahin kar rahe the, ab sabhi stekholders se baatcheet ko raji ho gaye hai
 BJP general secretary Ram Madhav said that this decision of the government is welcome
 unhone saaf kiya ki sarkaar or grih mantralay shuru se kah rahe hai ki kashmir main shanti ke liye ve sabhi pakshon se baatcheet ko raji hai

 talaak maangane ke kaaran main kaha gaya tha ki patni ne pati se vivaah se pehle breast surgery karaane kii baat chhipaai thi jiske kaaran baad main uskaa vajan bahut bad gaya
 The husband had complained that he could not enjoy marital life because of his wife's problem

 He argued that he persuaded the wife to undergo treatment but the wife refused to cooperate

 england ke khilaaf vanade series shuru hone se ek din pehle pune main bhartiya team ke captain viraat kohli ne jeet kii hunkaar bharte hue kaha tha ki vah in maichon ko 'trial' ke taur par nahin dekhte
 He is considering it to be the real preparation for the Champions Trophy to be held in England this year and therefore will take every match as a knockout match
 viraat ne jo kaha vah kiya bhi
 Started off with a win in the first ODI in Pune and then won the series in Cuttack
 ab baari kolkata main tisare or aakhri vanade match ko jitakarseries clin sweepakarne kii he
 After showing the brilliance of his captaincy in the Test, Virat has now started with a win in the ODI captaincy, but is the preparation of the Champions team for the Champions Trophy really going well? Yuvraj's return, Mahendra Singh Dhoni's form and Kedar Jadhav's big stage innings, Virat has achieved a lot in just two matches
 lekin, kuch aisi bhi baaten hai jo viraat ko pareshaan kar rahi hai, unhen bade faisle lene ke liye lalkaar rahi hai
 Indian bowler looted England, scored 350 in Pune ODI and 366 in Cuttack ODI
 zaraa sochiye, bhartiya gendbaaz in do match main kul 716 ran lutaa chuke hai
 Now either the Indian team has very good luck or England is very bad
 ab tak jasprit bumraah ne do match main 160 ran, aar asina ne do match main 128 ran, bhubaneshwar kumaar ne ek match 63 ran, rabindra jadeja ne 2 match main 95 ran or umesh yadav ne ek match main 63 ran lutaa daalen hai
 Now, which captain would not hold his head after seeing such a bowling? Is it just the batsmen's job to win the match? Here, despite winning so many runs at home, still winning, but what will happen in the Champions Trophy? Okay, the conditions will be different in England, but in ODI cricket there is a lot of bowling of bowlers
 sahi combination dhundhane ke liye ab viraat ke paas zyaada vakt nahin he
 a big bowler like Anil Kumble is the coach of the team and pray that he bring these bowlers to the line soon
 varanaa england main bhi bura haal hone vaala he
 Shikhar's figures are weak, needing to complete one run in Zorpune and 11 runs in Cuttack
 jo ballebaaz kabhi ek match main hi 111 ran bana daalata tha, aaj do match main sirf 12 ran bana paaya he
 Shikhar Dhawan is a match winner, everyone knows, but if he will win one after 10 matches, then what is his benefit? Gabbar's roar is missing and Captain Virat is thinking whether to put him in the playing-11 in Kolkata or sit him out
 ye sirf shikhar hi nahin, balki viraat ke liye bhi faisle kii ghadi he
 Ajinkya Rahane is waiting for a chance
 vaise, kolkata pahunchate hi shikhar apane anguuthe kaa eksre karaane aspataal gaye the
 His fitness can make it easier for Virat to take any major decision

 aatif bataate hai ki tikat paane kii aas main to the, lekin matiamhal se khadaa nahin hona chaahate the
 So a minority in a Muslim-majority vote bank had to be given a ticket, so the party decided to play bet on Dehlavi

 unhen yah mauka (apane dhan ke anya khaaton main sthanantarit karne kaa) kyon diya ja rahaa he?adwani ne kaha, ‘aise main is samjhaute kaa auchity hi samaapt ho jaataa he

 usne kaha, ‘‘isi uddeshy ke liye vibhinn muddon par sarkaar or rigerv bank ke bich gahan vichaar-vimarsh hota rahata he
 However, the statement did not mention that the government had never mentioned the power never exercised to instruct Governor Urjit Patel over a disagreement with the Reserve Bank

 pradhanmantri manmohan singh, vitt mantri pranab mukherjee or yojana ayog ke upaadhyaksh montek singh ahaluvalia pareshaan hai, kyonki banerjee unase koi salaah nahin letin
 In a meeting with Manmohan Singh and Pranab Mukherjee earlier this month, Mamta asked the two not to insist on increasing the rail fare
 unhen ummid he ki yah unka aakhri rail bajet hoga
 She wants to make it completely with her mind
 banerjee jaanati hai ki pashchim bengal ke matadaataaon ko lubhaane kaa bhi yah unka aakhri mauka he
 Therefore, this railway budget will also be filled with populist announcements, ie new railway lines and new trains for his home state

 Says a senior Railway Board official, "last year the condition was so bad that the money of the contractors was withheld till after the budget, so that the pink picture of the railway could be shown
 '' is saal signling ke liye istemaal hone vaale cabals or fish plate jaise jaruri upkarnon kii aapurti karne vaale sapliron kaa bhugtan nahin ho paaya he

 Officials associated with the Department of Budget and Finance are trying to know how to save the bad financial condition of the railway from going public
 yahaan bhi ve dabaav main hai, kyonki ve bina kisi mukhiya ke kaam kar rahe hai
 In fact, since Soumya Raghavan retired six months ago, the Railway Minister has not appointed a new Finance Commissioner (FC)
 banerjee dwaara chune gaye adhikari, atirikt sadsy samar jha hi bajet se judi taiyaariyon kaa nirikshan kar rahe hai
 An Railway Ministry official clarifies, "he decided to complete the budget work without the Finance Commissioner
 vitt ayukta hi gairajaruri kharch or pariyojnaon par sawaal karte hai, or didi is rail bajet ko lekar kisi bhi tarah ke sawaal yaa jaanch kaa saamana karne ke mood main nahin hai
 Raghavan said in March 2010, "if the continuation of high spending and low income continues, it will not only become difficult to raise the infusions, but there will also be a great risk of failure to pay dividend
 '' unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki fund balance kaa puraa istemaal ho chukaa he, aise main aantarik lakshyon kii purti ke liye kuch bhi paisa bachaa nahin he
 According to Raghavan, "it will be difficult for this organization to preserve its existence without putting a check on expenses and continuously increasing its income
" ''vitt ayukta ke alaava, railway pichley ek saal se bhi adhik samay se sadsy (yatayaat) ke bagaiyr kaam chalaa rahaa he
 The Member (traffic) is the most important officer of the railway, responsible for policy formulation and management of passenger and freight operations
 ek aise samay, jab yatri or maal dhulaai se railway apni aay badhaane main vifal ho rahaa he, tab is pad ke mahatv ko andekha nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Another major railway project - the Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) - is also derailed
 manmohan singh ne 2006 main is pariyojna kii aadharshila rakhi thi, lekin yah usase aage bad hi nahin pai
 In his last budget speech, Banerjee had promised to restructure the project and bring it back on track
 magar is disha main kuch bhi nahin hua
 The reality is that V

 The post has been vacant since Kaul was removed
 isi tarah, bhartiya rail takneekee or aarthik sevaayen bhi pichley teen maheene se bina kisi prabandh nideshak ke kaam kar rahi he
 Another official said, "banerjee is not interested in the day-to-day functioning of the ministry
" unki is berukhi ke saath hi mahatvapurn nirnay lene main bhi deree ho rahi he kyonki ve kabhikbhaar hi rail bhawan aati hai or kolkata se hi apana kaam chalaa rahi he
 All files have to be sent to Kolkata
 chunki ve ahm filein hai, isliye kai baar railway board ke adhyaksh sahit mantralay ke varisht adhikariyon ko khud hi filein lekar kolkata janaa padataa he
 As far as Rail Bhavan is concerned, he is the non-resident railway minister for that
 ''pichley bajet ke samay mukherjee ne banerjee dwaara prastaavit kuch pariyojnaon par etraj kiya tha, kyonki unhone yojana ayog se anivaary anaapatti nahin lee thi
 Only then did the Prime Minister in a note to Banerjee make some suggestions about the operation of the Railway Ministry
 kehane kii jarurat nahin, banerjee un par amal kaa koi iraadaa nahin rakhti
 a spokesperson of the Indian Railways defends the financial plight of the organization by saying that some things are outside the control of the ministry

 This is the reason why the Congress has already shown its preparations to avoid this and has distanced itself from this whole matter
 sutron ke mutabik congress kaa kahana he ki is ghatana se party kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 But the BJP is openly trolling on this matter

 Seeing himself trapped, Robert Vadra also immediately presented his case in the matter

 He did not contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections because of illness
