 Congress leader Dipendra Hooda said in the Lok Sabha today that i demand from the Congress that the Prime Minister should come and speak on this issue and tell what the government is doing? kisaanon kii durdasha par sarkaar ko kadam uthaane chahie

 The condition of the Punjab government-run schools is peculiar
 aisa lagata he ki fund kii killat se jujh rahi rajya sarkaar skulon main chaturth shrenee karmchaaree uplabdh karaane kii sthiti main nahin he
 This is the reason why the small children of the school are being done the work of cutting trees, cleaning and cleaning
 government elementry skool chat, mohali campus kaa ek hairaan kar dene vaala video saamne aayaa he
 In it, school children are seen climbing on the branches of tall trees, who went there to carve the leaves
 iske alaava skool ke raaston ko bhi wo saafe-safaai karte nazar aa rahe hai
 It is obvious that all this was done by keeping the safety of children at bay
 video main dekha ja saktaa he ki class 4 ke 2 bachche ped kii shakha par baithe hai or phir neeche utar rahe hai
 Two other children can be seen going to the classroom with the hoe
 bacchonpar teachers kaa kitna khoff he, ye isi se pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unhone class teacher kaa naam bataane se inkaar kiya or saath hi kaha ki wo apni marji se ped par chadhe the
 However, the children who appeared with Kudal admitted that they had been asked to maintain the way of the school
 mahila teacher ne karaayaa khatarnaak kamjis mahila teacher nebacchonse ped par chadhane jaisaa khataranaak kaam karaayaa tha, wo class main hi maujuud thi
 When the teacher was questioned about the neglect of the safety of the children, she denied her responsibility and said that the children had gone out of class on their own free will
 is teacher ne apana naam bataane se bhi parhez kiya
 India Today spoke to Punjab cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sandhu in this regard
 unhone bacchon se aise kaam karaane par skool staff ke khilaaf karrwai kaa bharosa diya
 She was going to Malaysia at that time

 Contrary to the common perception of Mahatma Gandhi not giving full time to his children due to the busyness, Bapu his grandchildren, sons
 putravadhuon samet parivaar ke sabhi logon kii choti choti baton kaa dhyaan rakhte the
 Mahatma Gandhi's great-granddaughter Neelam Parikh mentioned in the book 'jahan Rao, Mahkate Raho', based on Bapu's collection of letters, that despite all the busyness, Gandhiji used to guide his sons and daughters-in-law through his letters
 And gave them their valuable suggestions
 gandhi patr vyavhaar ke jariye niyamit rup se bacchon se sampark main rahete the or vah bacchon se bhi patr kii ummid rakhte the
 Bapu wrote to his son Harilal, 'no one reads your letter, such is your wish, but nothing is secret in the letters
 tumhaare bare main sab log jaananaa chahenge to ashram ke logon ke liye ek aisa patr tumhen jarur likhnaa chahie
 He further wrote, 'no matter how unhappy i am, i keep waiting for your letters
 mujhe maah main ek patr likhane or ek patr paane kaa haq he
 'bapu writes,' You sacrificed my experiment as i happened and you became 'ba'
 ba samaj gai, isliye ba ne jo paaya vah anya stri ne nahin paaya
 You are not able to understand the whole thing so that is why you get angry
 ’ patr vyavhaar ke madhyam se baapu ne jivan ke gudh siddhanton par ek shvasur or pita kii haisiyat se putravadhuon kaa bhi maargdarshan kiya or choti choti baton main dilchaspee lee
 Bapu wrote in a letter to his daughter-in-law, "in the Hindu world, the systematic upbringing and development of a girl child is completed only after marriage
" ramdaas, devdas kii padhai thik se hoti hogi
 Has Ramdas cured his phlegm? ’ unhone likhaa ‘tumhaari mangavaayi hui kitaaben bhej di he
 Send their money immediately
 ashram main udhaar ke khate nahin rahane chahie kyonki unke paas nijee milakiyat nahin he
 Do not keep your expenses and finery so that you become eligible for jealousy of others
 ’gandhiji ne apni putravadhu ko likhaa ‘‘khanpan kaa niyamit dhyaan rakhana
 Taking kanji of milk and sago regularly 'bapu said to his son and daughters-in-law through a letter' Remember that poverty is going to live in one's destiny
 is bare main jitna adhik sochataa hum, utana mujhe lagata he ki dhani hone kii tulana main garib rahanaa adhik kalyankari he
 'mahatma Gandhi, advocating for women's empowerment, wrote to his daughter-in-law' The surgeon of a woman is not just to do the kitchen
 jis had tak yah aavashyak he us had tak stri purush donon isamen bhaag lekar sevaabhaavi rahen
 Bapu wrote about the heir of the family, 'you should have such pride that if you cannot carry forward your father's legacy, you will not ruin it
 vaise sachcha vaaris vah he jo viraasat main vruddhi kare
 ' notebandi ke baad se hi deshbhar main noton ko lekar alag-alag khabaren aa rahi hai
 Somewhere there is a shortage of notes, while bundles of old notes are being held
 aisi hi ek khabar aa rahi he nainital se, jahaan ke kathgodam se kathghariya kii ore jane vaali nahar main 500 or 1000 ke puraane note bahakar aae hai
 The residents of the village put a net and took the notes out of the canal

 Before the scrapping of notes found in Meerut, on Saturday, there was a stir in Meerut, UP due to the fine clipping of lakhs of rupees on the roadside
 500 or 1000ke in noton ko paper kating mashin se kataran main tabdeel kiya gaya he

 On Saturday morning, people were surprised to see 500 and 1000 notes clipping in the area
 saikadon logon kii bheed jamaa ho gai
 The police was informed immediately
 police ne vahaan pahunch noton kii kataran ko apane kabje main liya
 At the same time, before the police arrived, some people also took clippings in their bags

 These notes were so finely made that one could not easily guess the clipping of the note by looking at them

 Contraceptive pills have been used for years not to conceive
 baavjood iske zyaadaatar mahilaayein iske seven ko lekar aashwast nahin ho paati hai
 There are many things related to birth control pills that have nothing to do with it
 mahilaon ko pehla bhram to yahi hota he ki kya wo bina doctor kii salaah ke garbhanirodhak le sakati hai
 By the way, it is best to consult a doctor before doing anything, especially to women who have a medical history
 par agar aap puri tarah se swasth hai to manyata praapt koi bhi ucch gunvattta vaali garbhanirodhak goli le sakati hai
 Another biggest myth about contraceptive pills is that their intake leads to weight gain
 darasal, zyaadaatar goliyon main estrogen or projestauran kaa mishran hota he
 The amount of estrogen causes water accumulation and the body becomes heavy, which leads to weight gain
 par aajkal kii garbhanirodhak goliyon ko banaate vakt is baat kaa vishesh dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he taaki vajan na bade
 But a woman suffering from stomach problems should consult a doctor
 teesraa bada myth ye he ki garbhanirodhak goliyon ke seven se prajnan kshamta par asar padataa he
 However, this is not completely wrong as bullets affect body hormones
 aise main agar aap garbhvatee hona chaahati hai to garbh thaharne ke do-teen maheene pehle se goliyon kaa seven band kar den
 Along with this, it is also said that its consumption affects the periods, but the chances of this happening are less
 haalanki hormonal change kii vajah se ye kuch had to prabhavit ho saktaa he lekin iskaa asar bahut kam hi hota he
 If you already have any problem related to the menstrual cycle, then apply the pills only after consulting a doctor

 Not only this, he also expressed sympathy for Pakistan
 iske baad bhi ve ruke nahin or shahadat par sharmnaak bayaan dene vaale mantri bhim singh ke bayaan ko bhi sahi tehraaya
 The extent was reached when he questioned the martyr Vijay Rai's family on a hunger strike
 unhone kaha tha, 'pakistan to khud hi aatankwaad se peedit he, ye aatankiyon kii karrwai he
 Bhim Singh did not say anything wrong
 unke bayaan ko galat tareeke se pesh kiya gaya
 The families of the martyrs should not go on hunger strike

 Two days before the Supreme Court heard the petitions challenging the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, the Union Government on Monday implemented the controversial law in relation to the appointment of members in the High Judiciary

 It is noteworthy that a constitution bench of 5 judges has been made in the Supreme Court to hear the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act

 On April 7, the double bench of the Supreme Court while sending the matter to the Constitution Bench, said that the matter of banning the law should be placed before the Constitution Bench

 These petitions stated that the appeal was repealed by declaring the NJAC Act as arbitrary and unconstitutional
 yachika main kaha gaya ki isse nyaayadhishon kii niyukti main karypalika kaa dakhal badhegaa jisase nyaaypalika kii swatantraaa or nishpakshta prabhavit hogi
 During the hearing, the Central Government had justified this in the court, saying that the Supreme Court can hear the matter right now because the notification has not been issued for it
 yachika main kaha gaya tha ki nyaayik niyukti ayog kanoon or 121waan samvidhan sanshodhan kanoon nirast kiya jaae, kyonki isse supreme court or hoicourt main nyaayadhishon kii niyukti main karypalika kaa hastkshep badhata he, jo na sirf nyaaypalika kii swatantraaa ko baadhit karata he balki samvidhan ke mul dhaanche ko bhi prabhavit karata he jisamen swatantra nyaaypalika kii baat kahi gai he

 Two eminent personalities will be selected by a three-member committee
 is samiti main pradhanmantri, mukhya nyaayadhish or loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh yaa sabase bade vipakshi dal ke netaa honge
 Section 5 (6) of the law says that if two members of the commission do not agree to appoint someone, then the commission will not recommend the appointment of that person
 yachikakarta kaa kahana he ki iskaa sidhaa matlab he ki mukhya nyaayadhish ke najariye ko nazarandaaj kiya ja saktaa he, jabaki supremecourt kii nau nyaayadhishon kii samvidhan peeth edwocket on record maamle main kah chuki he ki nyaayadhishon kii niyukti main mukhya nyaayadhish kii raay nazarandaaj nahin kii ja sakati, jabaki naye kanoon ke mutabik ayog kaa alp samooh (do sadsy) aisa kar sakate hai
 The new law does not decide what will be the merit of two eminent persons, nor is it decided from which field they will be elected while these two members will have the right to change the opinion of the remaining four members

 October 12, 1999 - This is the date on which General Pervez Musharraf overthrew Nawaz Sharif and also declared himself the Chief Executive of Pakistan
 ye takhta-palat bana kisi khun-kharabe ke hua tha
 Today, 17 years after that coup, the situation is such that former military dictator Musharraf himself has to flee his country and stay abroad
 vahiin pakistan main aaj usee shaks yani navaj sharif kii hukumat he jinka takhta musharraf ne palata tha
 Musharraf is in America these days and Sharif is taking over as the Prime Minister in Islamabad
 1999 takhtapalat kii barsi par paak pradhanmantri navaj sharif kii beti mariyam sharif ne twit ke jariye musharraf par tanj ksaa he
 Mariam has said in the tweet- "however Khuda's mill grinds slowly
 lekin wo puri safai ke saath sabhi ko pisati he
 For some, it is justice of the upright in return
 " mariyam ne apni baat ko saaf karne ke liye do photograph bhi aplod kiye
 In a photo, soldiers are seen occupying government buildings on 12 October
 vahiin duusari photo navaj sharif kii satta main vaapasi kii he
 Nawaz Sharif's party PML (N) has also targeted Musharraf on its official Facebook page and website
 saath hi takhtapalat ke baad musharraf ke kaarykaal ko pakistan kaa 'kaala adhyay' bataaya
 The party has written - "during his tenure, political opponents were imprisoned, deported and even murdered
 'aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai' ke naam pakistan ke rashtriya hiton se buree tarah samjhauta kiya gaya
 "the party also wrote that the worst power crisis is the result of Musharraf's tenure
 musharraf ke 8 saal ke kaarykaal main ek bhi urja project shuru nahin kiya gaya tha
 PML (N) wrote- "people first rejected Musharraf by choosing him in Punjab province in 2008
 phir centre main bhi 2013 main piemail-en ko avam ne satta saunpi
 The people of Pakistan similarly respond to dictatorship
 "piemail (en) ke party str par jashn ke maahaul se itar dekha jaae to ye saaf nahin he ki kya navaj sharif sarkaar khud ko pakistani sena ke prabhaav se khud ko puri tarah mukt karne main safal ho pai he
 Islamabad's confidential assessment of New Delhi is that Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is once again in a confrontation with army generals
 khufia inputs ke mutabik bharat ke sargical strike ke baad navaj sharif desh kii gharelu or videsh niti ko lekar saare adhikaar khud ke haath main rakhane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Let us tell you that Nawaz Sharif was believed to be on the backfoot after his son and daughter's name came to Panama Leaks
 aise main samajha ja rahaa tha ki gharelu or videsh niti par sena kii hi chal rahi thi
 It will be interesting to see who will be the last player in Pakistan
 janata kii chuni hui sarkaar kaa haath upar rahegaa yaa general raahil sharif kii aguai vaali sena hi supreme rahegi

 main apane bete kii suraksha ke liye chintit hum
 @anushkasharma @virat
 kohli The last thing we would want is to get publicity out of your cheap STUNT in the name of CLEANLINESS! You both posted a video for your fans n followers by VIOLATING Basic Rights to privacy &you shamed my son in the video as well in your post content you both may be who you are in your fields, with millions of followers & all the PR backing you
 
 
 you may be paid for your campaigning or maybe doing it for sheer publicity as a mother, i would like to state that you have not only shamed my son @arhhansingh on social media by not blurring his face, but youve also exposed him to unwanted hostility 
 
 
 
 and danger from fanatics for such a small thing that you claim he has done but have no proof of anyways? i am concerned about my sons SAFTEY !!! how dare you crush somebody's image / and morale and reputation and expose him to public hate, a boy who is on the verge of starting his ventures,
 
 just to prove what good citizens you both are to increase your fan following? How dare you ?? If you both really cared or bothered about cleanliness, then you would actively do something about all the garbage in your own lane
 
 you would make a noise and use your VOICE to urge the municipal authorities to take action atleast in the lane where you live, to start with, which you haven't
 Posting videos of fake bravado just to fool your followers
 If your intention was genuine then you would pull over and politely correct the person for littering IF THEY DID in a decent and real manner
 
 
 and not by displaying such a rude and arrogant attitude, and then posting it for the world to see! You have caused a lot of grief with your post & this is morally and humanitarianly very wrong
 You may be # anushkasharma or # viraatkohli in your house or on screen & the field
 
 
 but on the streets you are just a citizen trying to correct another
 
 
 DO IT WITH KINDNESS
 
 
 
 fear karma
 And just FYI , he did not react badly, not coz of who you both are
 
 we couldnt care less,but only because he has a decent upbringing ! Unlike people like you, who seem to think that you are the empowered ones to talk and treat people as you wish !A post shared bygittanjali(@gittanjali

 You did this to prove yourself a good citizen and to increase your fan following
 aapaki himmat kaise hui? agar aap donon ko safai kii itani hi chintaa hoti to aap apni gali main faile gandagi ke bare main jarur kuch karte
 You should have raised this in front of the municipal authorities of your area, which you did not do
 sadak par kooda phenkane vaale par bhadakin anoushka, dekhen videoagara aapke iraade nek hote to aap kachra failaane ke liye use achche se samajhaate
 
 
 Nor would he behave rude and arrogant and then post it on social media to show the world
 apane post se aapane bahut dukh pahunchaaya he or yah maanviya or naitik taur par galat he
 You may be Anushka Sharma or Virat Kohli at your home, screen or field, but on the road you are ordinary citizens, who are trying to improve others
 
 
 thodaa dayaalu banie
 Be afraid of karma aapaki jaankaree ke liye yah bhi bataa duun ki usne (arhan) ne aapako galat jawaab nahin diya
 
 
 Not because you're a star, we don't care
 
 
 balki isliye kyonki uski parvarish bahut achche se hui he
 He is not like you who think that you are strong, who can treat anyone

 Horrible! So i happened to carelessly Litter a sq mm of plastic while driving ! a car passing by rolls their window down and there we have our wonderful @anushkasharma ranting and yelling like a crazy roadside person! While I’m apologetic for my carelessness , Mrs Anushka Sharma Kohli a little etiquette and politeness in ur dialogue wouldn’t have made u a lesser star !! There are all kinds of manners and hygiene 
 
 verbal etiquette is one of them ! The garbage that mistakenly went out of the window of my "luxury car"

 This is the biggest waste
 lagata he ki kaamanwealth khelon kii taiyaariyaan ghotaalon kaa khel ban gai hai
 Be it sponsorship or buying and selling of goods, the problem is clearly visible
 aaj tak kar rahaa he khelon ke pahchaan-patr ko banavaane main ho rahe ghotaale kaa bada khulaasa
 The documents that are available till today show that the income of the common man is flowing like water
 cricket world cap card kii laagat thi 800 rupye
 The cost of making the Olympic Games card was Rs 1000
 suraksha ke lihaaj se sabase ahm sansad ke card kii keemat hoti he 2500 rupye lekin kaamanwealth khelon ke liye jo card ban rahe hai unki laagat hogi kareeb 4000 rupye
 The i-card being made for the Commonwealth Games costs only Rs 4000
 aayojan cameti ne gold medal system naam kii company ko kareeb 20 karod rupye main 50 hajaar card banane kaa jimmaa saunpa he
 Now just listen to the story inside this agreement
 aaj tak ke paas maujuud hai khel aayojan cameti kii rivyuu meeting kii mukhya baaten
 It is clear from the documents that initially only three companies had come forward for this work
 aakhri samay tak baaki kii do companiyon ne aavedan kiya hi nahin or jis ek company ne apana daawa pesh kiya tha, usne bhi aayojan cameti ko sirf saat dinon kii hi mohalat di thi faisla lene kii
 Meaning that important issues like i-card were also decided at the last moment
 ab ai-card ke is khel main sabase bada sawaal ye he ki baaki kii do companiyon ne aakhir apane haath peeche kyon hataa liye
 When Aaj Tak posed this question to both those companies, there was no answer from their side
 bollywood actor varun dhawan ke kariyar kaa graph kaaphi teji se upar kii taraf ja rahaa he
 He has done a total of 14 films so far, of which only 2 have flopped
 in dinon vah apane pita david dhawan ke nirdesan main ban rahi film kuli number van kii shooting main biji hai
 The film is a remake of the Govinda starrer film released in 1995, in which Varun will be seen alongside Sara Ali Khan
 film kii shooting maharashtra main chal rahi he or haal hi main shoot ke dauraan kuch aisa hua jisase kuch pal ke liye sabhi kii dhadakanen tham si gayi
 Actually it happened that the shooting of a stunt scene of the film was going on on the outskirts of Pune
 seen kuch aisa tha ki ek car ko khadi chattan se ulta latakana tha or is car main varun dhawan ko hona tha
 Everything was going right when something happened that nobody expected
 shoot ke dauraanvarun dhawanclose clin shev kara ke set par pahunche the kyonki unhen kuch chlosep shots dene the
 He was inside the car and the car was hanging from the rock
 varun ne stant diarectors or stant cordinators ke saath is sab kii practice kai baar sef jone main kii thi lekin phir bhi ek cheez real shot ke vakt gadabad ho gai
 The car door got stuck and even after trying several times it was not opening
 nahin ghabaraae varun dhawanstent cordinators ne badi jaddojehat ke baad varun dhawan ko gaadi se surakshit baahar nikaala
 According to one source, "varun Dhawan remained quite calm throughout the entire incident
 dikkat isliye bhi ho rahi thi kyonki gaadi kinare par lataki hui thi
 However, the stunt coordinator eventually managed to get Varun out safely
 " Congress President Sonia Gandhi in her Diwali message reminded the Modi government of Rajdharma
 sarkaar par hamalaa karte hue sonia gandhi ne khaas taur par kisaanon kii maujuuda halaat ko lekar sawaal khadey kiye
 He said that the farmers of the country are forced to celebrate this Diwali as 'kali Diwali' due to the anti-farmer policies of the government
 sarkaar kii vajah se kisaanon ko unki fasal ke liye sarkaar dwaara hi tay kiya gaya nunatam samarthan mulya bhi nahin mil paa rahaa he
 Explain that the minimum support is the amount on which the government buys crops from farmers
 sonia gandhi ne modi sarkaar ko pichley saal unke dwaara kiye gaye us vaade kii bhi yaad dilaai jisamen unhone kisaanon ko 50 fisadi zyada nunatam samarthan mulya dene kii baat kahi thi
 The Congress President said that the situation today is that farmers get their kharif crop at 22 times the minimum support price fixed by the government
 5 fisadi kam keemat par bechni pad rahi he
 Due to this policy of the government, farmers have suffered a loss of Rs 50 thousand crore
 unhone kaha ki bijepi sarkaar ne satta main aane ke saath hi kisaanon ke saath dhokhaa karne kii niti par kaam karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 Sonia Gandhi also opposed the government's imposition of GST on peasant related things
 saath hi unhone dijal kii keemat main aae din ho rahe ijaphe ko bhi galat bataaya
 He said that this directly affects the income of farmers
 bataa den ki congress is samay sabase bade sankat ke daur se guzar rahi he
 With regard to Article 370, when differences of opinion emerged at the national level leaders, the states are not getting along with each other
 madhya pradesh main jahaan siem kamalnath, digvijay singh or jyotiraditya sindhiya ke bich patari nahin kha rahe hai to rajasthan main siem ashok gahalot or sachin payalat ke bich tanatani saaf dikhaai de rahi thi
 At the same time, in Maharashtra too, leaving the party leaders and going with the BJP, in Haryana, Bhupendra Singh Hooda has adopted rebel till a few days ago
 retail sector main epadiai ke talane se kya-kya phayda hoga yaa aane se kya-kya nuksaan hoga? is vishay par ajtak ne fasebuk par logon se unki raay poochi jiske jawaab ne sabane khulkar apni raay vyakt kii
 Here are some selected ideas
 Ravikiran Yatageri:chote udyog pehle se hi mushkil main hai, agar epadiai lagu hoti he berogari or badhegi
 Tarak Patel: There is no benefit from FDI in retail
 keval kuch nai naukariyon ke liye lakhon kaa rojgaar chhin jaataa he
 It doesn't make any sense
 duusare deshon ko dekhakar aap sikh le sakate hai ki iskaa koi phayda nahin he
 Pranali Pokale: It is not that retail FDI will benefit from postponement and losses will come
 Prabhakar Dixit:meraa maananaa he koi bhi bideshi company apane phaayde ke liye bijness karegi use bhartiya janata ke hiton se koi matlab na hoga, jo strecchar FDI yahaan viksit karegi kya vahi strecchar hamaara desh khud nahin khadaa kar saktaa
 Megh Gholap: The Indian retail sector is showing 15 percent growth every year, so there is no need for FDI
 agar phir bhi sarkaar laana chaahati he to unka kaccha maal (kam se kam 85 pratishat) yaa product bhartiya hona chahie
 Rahul Jha: Foreign companies, not just FDI, should be instructed to use at least 50 percent of their raw materials only from Indian companies
 Anvesh Khan Bhardwaj:america kaa anubhav he- ek shahar main walmart ke ek mal kii kamai vahaan ke 84 pratishat chote dukandaaron kii kamai hadap ke hi hoti he
 And then there is a difference between India and America
 yahaan to 80 pratishat se zyada log shram shakti se pet bharte hai, wo is nuksaan se batch gaye hai
 How many people would a mall employ? 1000? But a mall would have created employment for 1000 families
 ek parivaar main kam se kam 4 log
 One city employs one lakh people and many of them are illiterate
 kya mal ek shahar main ek lakh rojgaar detaa?abhinay jain:fdi acha he or logon ko iskaa phayda samajhnaa chahie
 With this move of the government, inflation can be controlled to a great extent
 lekin raajnneeti logon kii soch ko prabhavit karti he or wo iske laabh ke vishay main nahin soch paa rahe
 i think TV channels should educate people on this issue
 Anand Mishra:mujhe lagata he ki ki agar epadiai se koi laabh hota bhi he to keval bade udyog hi uskaa phayda uthaaenge, chote udyogon or kisaanon ko isse koi laabh nahin hoga
 If we talk about employment then it is true that it will provide employment opportunities but we also cannot deny that more than 50 percent people will become unemployed due to this FDI and only 10 to 15 percent people will get employment from it
 
 jangal ke badshaah or uske kunbe ko aisi maut milegi, iskaa andaja na tha
 The lion (asiatic Lion) in the entire country has survived only in the forests of Gir in Gujarat and the Gujarat government presents it as its pride
 12 sitambar se 25 sitambar ke dauraan amarelli jile ke gir forest neshnal park kii daalakhania range main do vayask sher, paanch vayask sherni or saat shavakon samet 14 sheron kii maut se maamla gambhir ho gaya he
 One of the lionesses died during treatment
 in mauton ke thik baad gujarat sarkaar ke van mantri ganpat vasava ne daawa kiya ki ye maut ilaake par varchasv kaayam karne ke aapasi sangharsh main hui hai
 Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) a
 ke
 Saxena says, "there is nothing hidden or mysterious behind these deaths
 '' lekin jab paryaavarnavidon ne itane kam samay main ilaake main varchasv ke liye aapasi ladaai main itane adhik sheron kii maut par shankaa jaahir kii to rajya sarkaar cheti
 The incident has raised questions on the claim made by the Gujarat government in the Supreme Court that the lions are completely safe in its state
 maamle kii sanjidagi kaa ehsaas hote hi rajya sarkaar ne in mauton kaa rahasy talashne ke liye centre sarkaar kii madad maangi
 On September 23, a central team of wildlife experts at Gujarat's Guhar, whose two members include the Assistant Inspector General of the National Tiger Conservation Authority, Dr
 rajaraam sher or sanyukt nideshak aar
 Includes Gopinath (wildlife), visited the Gir forests
 unhone rajya ko salaah di he ki ve is ilaake main maujuud 45 anya sheron main bhi kisi sankraman kii jaanch karavaaen
 This two-member team also asked the state government to send samples of the bodies of these lions to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune and the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal so that the causes of death were clearly ascertained
 Can go ab maare gaye sheron kii autopsi or visra report kaa intjaar kiya ja rahaa he
 After visiting the central team, Vasava has made it clear that all the 45 lions present in this range are being examined
 iske alaava kendriya team ke daure ke baad gujarat sarkaar teji se harakat main aati dikhi or usne gujarat van vibhaag ke 270 sadasyon vaale bal ko 54 tiimon main baantkar teji se jaanch kaa kaam shuru kar diya he
 All these teams will investigate the symptoms of any disease in the lions present in Gir
 har team main ek forrester, do beet guard or ek line trekar shaamil hai
 If these teams get any lion sick then they will provide them immediate treatment
 inke kaam kaa dayera gir rashtriya udyaan ke 259 varg kilometre ke alaava iske aasapaas ke 1,153 varg kilometre main hoga, jise sheron kaa prakritik rahavaas mana jaataa he
 By the way, Gir has seen a steady increase in the number of lions
 ek anya pisisief ji
 K
 sinha kehete hai, "2015 kii gananaa ke mutabik, junagarh, gir somnath, amarelli or bhavnagar jilon main sheron kii kul sankhya 523 thi, jabaki 2010 main yah aankada 411 tha
 That is, in five years, there has been a 27 percent increase in the population of lions
 '' yahaan ke paanch van sthal gir vanyajeev abhayaarany, gir rashtriya udyaan, girnaar vanyajeev abhayaarany, matiyaala abhayaarany or paniya abhayaarany apni kshamta puri kar chuke hai
 Combining all this, 300 lions of habitable area and hunting are available in the entire Gir region
 isliye 1995 ke baad se hi, jab se singhon kii aabaadi kshamta se adhik hui, ve gir se baahar nikalne lage
 Experts believe that there has been an increase of about 20 per cent in human activities in the vicinity of Gir
 gujarat sarkaar kii der se sahi, par kaamkaaj main ai teji ghatnakram ke ek or nateezon kii taraf ishaara karti he
 Informed people are also linking this death of lions with any possible threat to the breed, one of which is stuck with the insistence of the Gujarat government in which this diocese is adamant on not sending its lions to the kuno-palpur forests of Madhya Pradesh
 
 agar yah sabit ho gaya ki sheron kii yah maut kisi beemaari se hui he yaa gir main ve puri tarah surakshit nahin hai to kuno-palpur ko sher nahin dene kaa gujarat kaa tark supreme court main kamjor pad jayega
 In fact, in 1986 the Central Government had selected the kuno-palpur Sanctuary to provide another habitat to the Asiatic lions to save the existence of the lions in the event of an epidemic or natural disaster
 kuno-palpur madhya pradesh ke shivpuri or shyopur jilon main failaa ek jangal he, jahaan kii paristhitiyaan sheron ke rahavaas ke anukool hai
 The Gujarat government was opposed to the plan from the beginning, while the Madhya Pradesh Forest Department has prepared a project to settle lions in kuno-palpur and about 1,500 families of the primitive tribe Sahariya living in the core area of the forest were given the year 2002-03
 Also displaced between
 lekin gujarat sarkaar saal 2004 main centre ke is faisle kaa virodh karte hue 19 singhon kaa pehla kunba dene se mukar gai
 He argued that due to its effective conservation program, there has been an increase in the population of lions, so only they are entitled to the lions
 lambii kanoonee ladaai ke baad april 2016 main supreme court ne gujarat sarkaar ko aadesh diya ki vah vanyajeev sangrakshan ke vyapak hit main kuch sheron ko kuno-palpur bheje
 But on this too, the Government of Gujarat has filed a review petition and argues that lions are completely safe in Gujarat
 gujarat ke aditol ravaie or tamaam tarkon ke baavjood tathy yah he ki khud rajya sarkaar ke mutabik, pichley do saal main koi 184 sheron kii maut ho chuki he
 In a written reply to the Gujarat Legislative Assembly in March this year, Forest Minister Ganpat Vasava admitted that the death of 32 of these lions was unnatural
 haalanki vaasava ne aprakritik mauton ke kaarnon kaa ullekh nahin kiya lekin jaankaar bataate hai ki jaharkhurani, gadipoon or train kii chapet main aana or bina munder vaale kuon main girane se sheron kii maut aam he
 Apart from this, lions also die from snake bites, swirling rivers and electrocution by electric wires on the banks of forests which have been planted by villagers to protect their cattle
 aadhikarik taur par mana jaataa he ki vanya jivan main singhon kii maut main se 60 fisadi kudarti hoti hai
 By the way, Hemang Shah, a lawyer appointed by the Gujarat High Court as amicus curiae, has submitted a draft to the court to defend the lions, which would stop illegal mining, stop electric fencing in the vicinity, like setting up cameras and speedguns every 500 meters
 Has made recommendations
 par, naam na chhapane kii shart par ek paryaavaranvid bataate hai, "gir ke ilaake main avaidh khanan bhi sheron kii maut kaa bis he or sarkaar ne avaidh khanan or atikaramanon par roak lagane ke prabhavi upaay nahin kiye hai
 Resorts that have grown like mushrooms around these sanctuaries are also shrinking the habitat of the lions
 ''asal main, apane africa biraadaron se koi ek lakh saal pehle alag hue bhartiya yaa asian sher bas yaheen bache hai
 If a disease like Tanzania threatens the lives of these lions, then this breed will be completely destroyed
 das din ke bheetar 14 sheron kii maut se kai sawaal uth rahe hai
 What is the harm in giving lions to the kuno-palpur sanctuary to deal with the problem of increasing numbers along with safety and prevention of disease? It will be difficult for Gujarat to stick to its insistence now

 At the Rohania rally, bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi took blessings by touching the feet of this person

 twitor par # sonamguptabewafahai trol karata rahaa to watsap par bhi isaki behad charchaa rahi
 After some time, this matter became quiet but on 14 November, the message was received again on the new 2000 note, once again it went viral on the Internet
 Twitter nae luk ke saath aa chukaa he
 It has already been launched, but now almost everyone is able to use the new Twitter interface
 haalanki isse kai Twitter yugers naakhush hai
 Some users do not like its new look
 aise main agar aap chahen to puraane Twitter interphes ko abhi bhi yuj kar sakate hai
 There are major changes in the new interface of Twitter and it also has some special features which are beneficial for the users
 haalanki Twitter ne koi aisa tarika nahin bataaya he jisase nae Twitter se puraane Twitter interphes par ja sakate hai
 We tell you two ways you can go to the old Twitter user interface
 ye pehla tarika he
 Under this, you will be able to use before logging out or before you close Twitter
 jaise hi aapane Twitter log out yaa Twitter kaa teb band kiya aap phir se nae Twitter interphes main aa jaaenge
 --- Login to Twitter and click on More or it will be found on the left side of the profile
 --- settings or privesi opshan ko select karen yahaan aapako kai opshans milenge
 Select About Twitter option
 --- dayee taraf kii list main Directory kaa opshan dikhegaa yahaan select karen
 Now you can click on the Home tab
 aisa karke aap notice karenge ki purana Twitter profile dikh rahaa he
 That is, the user interface will be outdated
 lekin jaise hi aap is teb ko band karenge yaa phir log out karenge to aap phir se nae Twitter par honge
 The second option has a third party extension
 yani iske liye aapako google krom broujar main ek extansion downlod karke set karnaa padegaa
 There is an extension named goodtwitter
 ye krom ke alaava firefox main bhi he
 After downloading it and installing Twitter, then the old user interface will open
 ye aapako upar he ki aap third party extansion yuj karenge yaa nahin
 Till date, Tech does not recommend installing such extensions

 But talks have been held between the two parties regarding the rally
 jaahir he bihar ke siem nitish kumaar manch se narendra modi ko ek baar phir pradhanmantri banane kii apil karenge
 One thing to note here is that Nitish Kumar, who once gave consent for campaigning on behalf of NDA in Bihar from 2005 to 2010 by calling Narendra Modi communal, will ask for votes in favor of Modi and also tell about his achievement
 vahiin saal 2013 main kareeb 17 saalon se jari gathbandhan se nitish kumaar isliye alag ho gaye the kyonki bijepi ne narendra modi ko loksabhaa chunaav 2014 ke liye pradhanmantri ke pad kaa daavedaar bana diya tha
 After this, Nitish Kumar fought the Bihar assembly elections in 2015 with RJD, Congress (grand Alliance) and won a landslide victory
 lekin iske baad mahagathbandhan main khatpat shuru ho gai or bade hi naatakeey ghatnakram main nitish kumaar mahagathbandhan se alag ho gaye or bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar bana lee
 But in this entire exercise, JDU strongman Sharad Yadav broke away from the party

 Thus after the election of Ra jya Sabha seats of UP, BJP will be strengthened further in Rajya Sabha

 piechdi ke liye inrol hue use saat maheene hue hai
 The dream of this university, which is called Oxford of the East, is being shattered every day by colliding with its dream-like reality
 vah kahati he, “uniwarsity main apane hi vibhaag main aana har roj kisi yuddh ke maidan main aane kii tarah he
 "and in this situation no enemy has put him, his own research guide and professor
 uske guide ek sammanit vidwaan hai or desh-duniya ke seminaron main bhaashan dete hai, lekin chaatraon ke paas hote hi unka ek or cheharaa saamne aata he
 She explains, "they have openly offered me sex
" is aakarshan ke saath ki piechdi jaldi or acchhee hogi or ve lekcharraship ke liye sifarish bhi kar denge
 "also, there is a hidden threat that if she does not agree, she should consider her career
 ek or kendriya uniwarsity kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay main piechdi kii ek chaatra ne teen maheene pehle apane research guide ke khilaaf galat tareeke se sharir ko chune or ashleel ishaare karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 He complained that the professor put a hand on his chest on the pretext of hugging
 shikaayat vivi ke gender cell tak pahunchi, lekin yon utpeeda rokane ke liye bane is vibhaag ne koi karrwai karne kii jagah ladki ko samaj-bujhakar or thodaa daraakar maamle ko dabaa diya
 And the female professors of the university took up the responsibility of understanding and intimidating the girl
 kya bhartiya vishvavidhyalay or ucch shiksha santhaan desh main yon utpeeda ke sabase bade thikaanon main tabdeel ho gaye hai, jahaan shikshakon kii yon lipsaa chaatraon par kahar dha rahi he? yah asahaj karne vaali baat he, lekin sach yahi he ki guru-shishy ke pavitra kahe jane vaale rishton main kuch bhi pavitra nahin he
 Professor Asha Vajpayee of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai, who keeps a constant watch on such cases, says, "very serious cases of sexual harassment are seldom found in education campuses
 rosemara kii jindagi main bade paimaane par yah sab ho rahaa he, lekin ladkiyaan aksar munh nahin kholtin or jab kabhi aisa koi maamla saamne aa bhi jaataa he to jaanch cameti bithakar maamle ko rafa-dfa karne kii koshish hoti he
 "actually, it has been assumed that sexual harassment is not as bad as the case is exposed because it spreads slander
 campus ke kukarmihal hi main professor aaysha kidawai ke netritv main dilli kii jawaharlal nehru uniwarsity main chaatraon par kiye gaye ek survey se pataa chalaa ki 96 fisadi chatraayen campus ke bheetar kisi-ne-kisi rup main yon utpeeda kaa shikaar hui hai
 The most alarming thing is that 63 per cent of the girls have accused male teachers of sexual harassment and making lewd comments against women
 aisa bhi nahin he ki maamla hameshaa dabaa-chipa rahata he
 When the water passes through the head, many times girls are forced to complain
 chand maamalon main professor saahabon ko naukari chhodmai bhi padi he to kuch maamalon main giraftaar tak kii naubat ai he (dekhen box)
 But this happens rarely
 patna vivi main dedh saal pehle ek sexual harasment compline cameti bani he
 Its Chairman Professor Bharti S
 kumaar garv se bataati hai ki unke paas yon utpeeda kii ab tak koi shikaayat nahin ai he
 So does the girl students at Patna University not have anything like this
 ladakiyon se baat karte hi uniwarsity kii duusari hi sachai saamne aati he
 Aarti (name changed), a student doing MA from Hindi, says, "the teacher keeps staring at girls awkwardly in the class room
" niraala yaa kisi bhi kavi ko padhaate hue jane kahaan se sex kii baaten nikaal lete hai
 He is taught the same rasa in the name of literature - Shringar Ras
 ” eme second year kii ek chaatra apana naam na bataane kii shart par kahati he, “teacher aise samay main offis main bulaate hai, jab vahaan koi na ho or phir gandi-gandi baaten karte hai
 We are afraid but who should complain
 ghar waalon tak baat pahunchi to padhai chhudwakar shaadi kar denge
 Divya Gautam, 24, who is graduating in Mass Communications from the same university, angrily says, "girls are scared first
 phir ve chahen bhi to shikaayat kahaan karen
 The Sexual Harassment Compliance Committee has neither an office nor a phone number
 chaatraon ko to yah bhi nahin bataaya gaya he ki aisi koi cameti bhi he
 "your complaint - Even if you have a complaint of sexual harassment, the whole emphasis is on defending the case
" shikshakon kii maansikta aisi he ki dosha to ladakiyon kaa hi hota he or unhen hi batch-bachaakar chalanaa chahie
 Member of Gender Cell of Magadh College, Dr
 suheli mehta kahati hai, “chaatraon ko khud hi limit main rahanaa chahie
 What is the need of the students of Magadh College to visit Patna College? ” This mindset is in universities across the country
 elahabaad vivi se piechdi kar rahi 28 varshiya durgesh chouhan kahati hai, “kisi chaatra kaa agar koi bwoyfriend he yaa ladakon se vah sahajata se baat karti he to yon utpeeda kii shikaayat karne kaa uskaa adhikaar khatm samajhie
 Teacher will taunt that this girl has friendship with four boys, its own character is not good
 ” elahabaad uniwarsity main haal tak procter rahe ek professor aisi kisi bhi shikaayat par ladakiyon ko hi bhaga dete the ki tum log to ladakon ke saath gumti ho, haalanki ve apni safai main kehete hai ki “main to hameshaa ladakiyon kii madad karata tha
 The responsibility of avoiding sexual harassment is also often passed on to girls
 shiksha sansthaanon main chaatraon ke saath hone vaale sexual harasment par research karne vaali mumbai kii esandity uniwarsity kii dow
 Veena Punacha says, "any city or any educational institution, the character of the student who complains of secular harrassment is the first to be under suspicion
" chaatra agar aaazadkhyal he or feminist he yaa genes pahenti he, agar uskaa bwoyfriend he yaa vah talakshuda he to yon utpeeda karne vaale kii jagah chaatra ko hi apradhi maan liya jaataa he
 "such cases are now continuously coming up in Indian universities, but the judicial system or the internal system of the university is not able to set an example that will provide any lesson to the sex offender professors
" maamla dabaae na dabe or duniya main thu-thu hone lage to aise mastaron ko adhiktam anivaary sevanivritti kii sajaa bhugatni padati he
 Professor Ajay Tiwari was sent to compulsory retirement on charges of sexually harassing a student at Delhi University, while bhu's associate professor Narendra Kumar was suspended instead of terminating his service
 biechayu ke hi bal chikitsa vibhaag ke professor bidi bhaatia ko bhi ek chaatra kii shikaayat ke baad jabaran ritair karne kaa faisla kiya gaya
 The professor accused of sexually harassing his student in JNU also
 aar
 Nair was forcibly sent to retirement
 jabaran sevanivritti ke rup main vishvavidhyalayon ne ek aisa rasta nikaal liya he, jisamen vishvavidhyalay kii izzat bhi batch jaati he or shikshak ko ritairement ke baad ke saare benifit bhi aaraam se milte rahete hai
 Students have changed - Master has not changed Indian universities have changed drastically in recent years
 badi sankhya main ladkiyaan ab ucch shiksha main aa rahi hai
 Looking at the number of phd scholars in many universities, girls have now surpassed boys
 misaal ke taur par lakhanu vishvavidhyalay main varsh 2011-12 main kul 475 vidhyaarthiyon ko piechdi kii degree di gai, jinamein se 249 ladkiyaan or 226 ladke hai
 As the figure of girls reaching phd in education has changed, has there been any change in the number of teachers? Statistics show that university staff staff rooms are still men's bases
 isi vishvavidhyalay main 276 purush shikshakon ke mukaable sirf 120 mahila shikshak hai
 Due to the low number of women in the staff room, the practice of listening to masculine obscene jokes and abusing among male teachers is not coming to an end
 jab tak shikshak or chaatr donon purush hote rahe, tab tak campus main yon utpeeda kii ghatnaayen yaa to kam hoti thim yaa phir dabi-dhaki rahati thim
 Now the situation has changed decisively as the number of girl students increases
 chunki apwaadon ko chhodkar, yon utpeeda ke lagbhag sabhi maamle dabe-chhipe rah jate hai, isliye aankadon kaa koi tulanaatmak adhyayan sambhav nahin he
 But it is very clear that now the students are encouraged to complain
 yon utpeeda ke khilaaf desh main ban rahe vyapak maahaul kaa asar bhi campus main hua he or is bare main ab khulkar baat hone lagi he
 Most universities have created gender cells and have started working only for formalities
 yah mahatvapurn badlaav he ki chatraayen ab chaatro se kahin badi sankhya main piechdi karne lagi hai
 This should affect the number of teachers
 lekin yah nahin ho paa rahaa he
 The biggest reason for this is that due to the pressure of teachers, their retirement age has been increased to 65 years and after retirement, teachers remain attached to universities in many ways like reapplication and even Emeritus Professor
 is vajah se nae pad nahin aa rahe hai or jo pad aa bhi rahe hai, unhen bharne kii jagah vivi temprari or edock shikshakon se kaam chalaa rahe hai
 Temperately appointed appointments in Temperary, adhawk and nonprofit institutions are a major reason for sexual abuse

 From the police station to Delhi University's Sexual Harassment Complex Cell 'apex Committee', there was no door which he could not have knocked, but there was no hearing
 ant main usne yah kadam uthaaya
 The ground truth is that temporary teachers and employees depend badly on university administration and professors to continue their jobs
 unke bich kaa sambandh behad aloktantric hota he or iskaa laabh kai purush shikshak uthaate hai
 For example, there are 4,000 temporary teachers in Delhi University and related colleges against about 6,500 permanent teachers
 temprari teachers ko pratimah 40,000 se 45,000 rupye tak par kaam karte hai, lekin iske alaava unhen or koi suvidha medical or chhuttiyaan aadi nahin milteen
 Their contract is only 4 months and the contract renewal is also at the mercy of the college
 lakhanu uniwarsity main kuch self finance course main 35 ke kareeb shikshak edock par hai, jinhen 25,000 se 35,000 rupye tankhwaah milti he
 Apart from this, some teacher assignments are also on contract, which are given 250 to 500 rupees per lecture
 aage chalakar kabhi permanent hone kii sambhaavna bhi in mahila shikshakon ko jhukkar sabakuch sah lene ko majaboor karti he
 It becomes the cause of all kinds of exploitation
 darasal chaatraon or edock mahila teacheron ke saath sambandhon main maujuud aloktantric takat ke sameekaran purushon ko shoshan kaa khulaa maidan muhaiyaa kara rahe hai

 yahaan manaregaa (mahatma gandhi rashtriya rojgaar yojana) se jude ek adhikari kaa dhardaar hathiyaar se haath kaat diya gaya

 On the way, Srinivas was attacked with an ax-like weapon
 shrinivas ke haath par itani nirmamata se waar kiya gaya ki unki teen ungliyaan alag hokar latak gayi
 After the attackers fled, people came forward to help Srinivas
 unhone police ko soochna dekar ambulance ko bulaayaa

 Karnataka's Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister HK Patil met Srinivas and assured that strict action would be taken against the culprits

 It was the rainy September of 2005
 mumbai main halki barish shuru ho chuki thi
 The general meeting was convened by BCCI President Ranbir Mahindra
 maharashtra kii raajnneeti ke suurama sharad pavaar bhi pahunche the
 Nobody knew what was going to happen next
 tab tak bhi nahin jab pavaar ne mahindra kii adhyakshata ko khuli chunauti dete hue nae sire se chunaav kii maang kar daali
 Everyone felt that Pawar is joking because Jagmohan Dalmiya tasted Pawar's first defeat of life in the election of the Speaker just a year and a half ago
 mahindra daalamia ke ummidavaar the
 Voting was decided on the third day of the General Assembly
 aaj ke ipel kamishnar rajeev shukla daalamia ke daahine haath maane jate the
 Rajiv Shukla was hanging out with Dalmia till the morning of voting
 lekin chaar ghante baad jab nattejey aae to sharad pavaar ke saath jeet ke jashn kii pehali tasviir rajeev shukla ne khinchvaai
 Sharad Pawar's victory changed the idiom of control of Indian cricket
 1980 main maratha raajnneeti ke kshatrap encapi salve ne cricket main jo sameekaran banaae the uske shikhar kii yatra shuru ho chuki thi
 After all, what was it in the company of cricket that once the clever chakras of politics felt they enjoyed it? madhav raav sindhiya se lekar narendra modi tak
 There were two big reasons for this
 ek to khule bazaar kii araajaktaa kaa bharpoor anand or duusare janata yaa desh ke prati javabdehi se sampurna azaadi
 Cricket is the only game in this country which despite being on full profit streak, creates a tide of nationalism
 aisi vyavastha netaaon ko fouran aakarshith karti he
 In 1990, when Madhav Rao Scindia became the President of BCCI, people called it a waste of time
 lekin sindhiya se shukla ke safar main samay kii sui 180 degree ke kone par gum chuki he
 a company named BCCI worth 954 crores has become a gateway to the dream of politicians
 akut paisa, mutthi main sitare, bazaar kii hatheli or apana sikaa
 After the IPL came into existence, the business of cricket has also increased and control has also expanded
 gaur karne vaali baat ye he ki is vistaar ke saath jimmedaari or naitikta kii zamin sikudti gai he
 That is why Navjot Singh Sidhu, who ate the expensive salt of the IPL, has to say how the IPL was tainted due to two or four players getting caught in the fixing when the Parliament filled with corrupts remains holy
 yah hairat vaali baat nahin he
 The stigma of cricket, which vows to tackle each other on parliamentary corruption, has unexpectedly become a shield in the narrative
 sabko pataa he ki cricket kii raajnneeti main ve ek duusare kaa galaa katkar nahin ek duusare ko gale lagaakar hi aage bad sakate hai
 Is it sudden that Arun Jaitley, who forced the government to sacrifice Railway Minister Pawan Bansal and Law Minister Ashwani Kumar on corruption, finds the IPL system both sinless and innocent
 jetali bisisiai kii anushaasan samiti ke adhyaksh hai lekin unhone na kisi kaa istipha maanga na apane istife kii peshkash kii
 People say that Jaitley is eyeing the chair of the BCCI president
 unhen pataa he ki yah kursi unhen en shrinivasana or rajeev shukla ke jugad ke bina nahin mil sakati
 So they find an alternative to the broken taboos of morality in silence
 jab police shrinivasana ke ghar tak pahunch gai tab jaakar jetali guuruuvaar ko rajeev shukla se milane pahunche
 When bjp's outspoken MP Kirti Azad directly demanded Rajiv Shukla's resignation, his party colleagues called him ill
 himachal pradesh cricket sangh ke adhyaksh anuraag thakur ne to saare daagiyon ko yah kehete hue fori clin chit de daali ki aarope sabit hue bagair kisi ko sattebaaz yaa fiksar kahana bahut galat he
 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi sees disturbances in the treatment expenses of Sonia Gandhi but there is no flaw in the IPL led by Rajiv Shukla
 aisa isliye hota he ki rajeev shukla, arun jetali yaa en shrinivasana par sawaal uthaane se pehle unhen yaad aa jaataa he ki ve gujarat cricket sangh ke adhyaksh bhi hai
 Favicole of the brotherhood of cricket fills the cracks of hostility of politics in such a way that not a single hole is left
 yah bhaichara modi bhi nibhaate hai or pavaar bhi, jetali bhi or rajeev shukla bhi
 CP Joshi, President of Rajasthan Cricket Association, who received the reward of the Ministry of Railways in the name of Iman, is not sitting there just by taking a dip
 is hangaame ke bich bhi jyotiraditya sindhiya ne kisi ko yah pataa tak nahin chalane diya ki ve bisisiai kii sabase shaktishaalee maani jane vaali vittiya samiti ke adhyaksh bhi hai
 Lalu Yadav, former president of the former Bihar Cricket Association, has been known for his devotion in person rather than thought anyway
 isiilie na kisi ne en shrinivasana ko sadak par ghaseet laane kii kasam khai or na kisi ne rajeev shukla ko naitikta kii duhai di
 Cricket can only invent such a rare unity among politicians
 is baat kii bhi khoj honi abhi baaqi he ki sharifon kaa khel kaha jane vaala cricket netaaon ke dakhal ke saath ganda kyon hota gaya
 Where the leaders could not come, their favorite bureaucrats went ahead and otherwise the industrialists
 netaa, naukarshah or dhandhebaazon kii ye ghaatak tikdi saream is khel kaa koon hote dekh rahi he
 It is not only with cricket
 suresh kalmadi ne keval kaamanwealth main hi naam nahin kamaaya, indian olympic association ko bhi barbaad karke dam liya
 Boxing has been retained by Abhay Chautala, Yashwant Sinha is not ready to give up tennis, Praful Patel is keeping the Football Association a stumbling block, while unsuccessful shooter Archery Politics Vijay Kumar Malhotra
 cricket par netaaon kii nazaren isliye zyaada meharbaan huin kyonki isamen paisa zyaada he, glamer zyaada he or rutaba ganthne ke avasar zyaada hai
 Nobody has any kind of partition in this manor of excess
 yah netaaon kaa hi karishma he ki hazaar tarah kii herapheri ke baavjood sarkaar na to bisisiai ko saarvajanik auditing ke liye taiyaar kar pai, na soochna ke adhikaar ke andar laa pai or na hi lokapal yaa lokayukta ke daayre main laa pai
 Accepting the anarchy of the BCCI in the name of internal democracy has been the compulsory compulsion of both the government and the public
 ant main phir ipel par lautate hai
 As the scope of investigation on fixing and betting is getting bigger, this Sreesanth, Chavan and Chandila are shrinking into a small piece of big conspiracy
 jis khel main haar jane kii mazaduri jeet jane ke jazbe se hajaaron guna mahangi ho us khel ko naitikta kii door baandhakar rakhti bhi to kabatak
 All these things can be okay but will not happen
 isaki ek thos vajah he
 As long as there was sportsmanship among the politicians, it continued to go well, but the day the game started being played with the spirit of politics, it started eroding from the same day
 philhal to yah ravaayat badalani bahut mushkil lagati he
 Cases of buying voters to vote in their favor in the elections have often come up, but the issue of sharing of money for not voting has rarely been heard before
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke antim charan ke liye aaj matdaan ho rahaa he
 However, a surprising case has already come up
 jahaan daliton kii ungali par vot dene se pehle hi syaahi laga di gai
 Along with this, he was also given money
 maamla uttar pradesh ke chandauli loksabhaa seat kaa he
 Where the issue of distributing notes for not voting has come up
 chandauli loksabhaa ke tarajivanpur gaanv main dalit basti ke logon ne bijepi kaaryakartaaon par vot na dene ke liye paise baantne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The people of the Dalit colony have accused the ruling party of not only giving them money for not voting but also putting the ink used in the election on their fingers so that they could not vote
 logon kaa aarope he ki matadaataaon ko 500-500 rupye die gaye or vot na dene ke liye kaha gaya
 On the other hand, as soon as the issue of not voting after the issue came to light, Samajwadi Party MLA Prabhu Narayan Singh Yadav of Samakaldiha Assembly and Samajwadi Party candidate Dr
 sanjay chouhan sahit darjanon kii sankhya main samaajawaadee party ke kaaryakarta chandauli jile ke alinagar thane main pahunch gaye or thane kaa gheraav karte hue dharne par baith gaye
 Samajwadi Party leaders and activists were demanding that action should be taken against those who tried to stop the use of the franchise by paying money
 udhar jila prashasan ne maamle kii jaanch kar kaarywahi kii baat kahi he
 However, police have registered a case against three people in this case
 bataa den ki chandauli loksabhaa seat se bhartiya janata party ke pradesh adhyaksh dow
 Mahendra Nath Pandey is in the fray
 vahi samaajawaadee party ne dow

 input- bhashaa After the biggest victory in the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP went ahead with the Modi wave
 maharashtra, haryana or jharkhand main to bijepi kii sarkaar ban gai lekin jammu-kashmir main maamla atak gaya
 It is now Delhi's turn, where President's rule has been there for 11 months

 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, only Arvind Kejriwal is still on the bjp's target, having won all the seats of Delhi
 lohe ko loha hi kaategapichley vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne vijay goyal ko hataa kar saaf suthri chhavi vaale harshavardhan ko project kiya tha
 The figures may not have been supported but they did not expect
 phir bhi bijepi ko is baar apane kader par shaayad utana bharosa nahin rahaa
 Perhaps that's why Kiran Bedi, who came from outside, was preferred as the candidate for the Chief Minister of Delhi, Harshavardhan, Satish Upadhyay, and all BJP leaders

 But Sisodia has been an MLA from Patparganj and Binny is an outsider
 modi-bedi lahar main bhi binni agar yahaan se jitate hai to yah bada ulatpher hoga
 What will be the seat of Shazia? Shazia Ilmi, who was one of the founders of Aam Aadmi Party, has also joined the BJP but she is not in the list of 62 declared BJP candidates
 to kya somnath ke khilaaf bijepi shajia ko maidan main utaaregi? aap kii 49 din kii sarkaar ke sabase charchit mantri somnath bharti ko party ne malviya nagar se ummidavaar banaaya he
 The way Kejriwal defended Somnath during that period, it seems that Somnath is his trusted companion after Sisodia

 In such a situation, speculation can also be made about Shazia

 🙌 # thisishowwedo — KATY PERRY (@katyperry) August 1, 2014 abhinayta ajay devgan apni nai film 'atithi kab jaaoge' ke liye media se milte vakt apni patni kaajol or unki taaja film 'maai nem ij khan' ke bare main baat karne ke liye taiyaar nahin hue
 However, he definitely said that he never interfered in Kajol's career
 magar lakh koshishon ke baavjood unhone is film ke bare main apni raay nahin bataai
 Yes, but he was troubled by the question that Ajay, once the leader in action and emotion, has now been limited to comedy
 ajay ne ise darshakon kii pasand se jodate hue kaha, 'aam darshak manoranjan chahta he
 The message is clear that if they return to directing, they will make a comedy film
