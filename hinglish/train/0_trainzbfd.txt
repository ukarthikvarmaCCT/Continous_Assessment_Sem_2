 By order, the country's most prestigious medical institutes were undergoing treatment at AIIMS
 doctoron ne yah satyapit kiya hoga ki inako ab ilaaj kii jarurat nahin he
 Now people of Rashtriya Janata Dal are questioning if Lalu is discharged from AIIMS
 unhone rashtriya janata dal par tanj kasate hue kaha ki aap charvaaha vidhyalay ke janak hai
 Who knows the pain of childbirth
 MBBS padhe hai, lekin AIIMS ke swaamitv par sawaal khadaa karte hai
 Questioning the quality of AIIMS
 niraj ne kaha ki jaisi kerani, waisi bharani
 Lalu is enjoying what he has done
 niraj ne lalu se kaha ki aap nyaaypalika ke aadesh par AIIMS aae the or ab dobaaraa waapas jaakar us hotwar jail kii shobhaa badhaaie
 AIIMS gave these statements even though Laloo is saying that he is not well, but AIIMS Hospital says that his health is right
 ames ne kaha, ''lalu yadav ko ranchi ke rems se yahaan refer kiya gaya tha
 His health improved a lot
 jiske baad unhen waapas rems medical college bheja ja rahaa he
 "lalu counted several illnesses
 Before being discharged, Lalu Prasad Yadav said in his letter to AIIMS," i have been told that action is being taken to discharge from the hospital

 'lalu ne aage likhaa, 'main aapako suchit karnaa chahta hum ki ranchi medical college main samuchit ilaaj kii vyavastha nahin he
 It is the constitutional right of every citizen to get proper treatment to his satisfaction
 na jane kis agency or raajnneetik dabaav main mujhe yahaan se hataane kaa nirnay liya ja rahaa he
 Lalu Yadav further urged the Director not to discharge
 lalu ne apane letters main likhaa, 'jab tak main puri tarah thik nahin ho jaataa, tab tak mujhe yaheen rakhkar meraa ilaaj kiya jaae
 If i am sent to Ranchi Medical Hospital and it poses a threat to my life, then it will be the responsibility of all of you

 i am Ravish Kumar
 aaj rashtriya paristhiti main antarrashtriya paristhiti kii baat karenge
 This is a situation over which no government has any control and that is why the prices of petrol, diesel and gas increase
 lekin is antarrashtriya paristhiti ke falswaroop rashtriya paristhiti main paidaa hui chizon yani aalu-pyaaj ke daam bad jate hai, use sarkaar naanaa prakaar kii baithkon or nirdeshon se kyon nahin roak paati he? In the event of this not happening, political parties used to burn effigies of Manmohan Singh till two months ago, nowadays Narendra Modi has started burning
 kasoor antarrashtriya paristhiti kaa or putala dahan rashtriya paristhiti ke netaaon kaa
 The performances have become boring
 samaajawaadee party ne aaj is boriyat ko todate hue varanasi main putala dahan kii jagah motorcycle dafan kaa idia nikaala
 The matter seems to be secular, so the bike was surrendered in one place, and the symbolic immersion of the bike in Maa Ganga was done in Hindu way
 mahangaai raajnneetik dalon ko creative bana detii he
 The BJP which used to shut down India against the Manmohan government, is running the Government of India these days
 iske baad bhi antarrashtriya paristhiti kaa bal baankaa nahin kar paa rahi he
 The only difference is that the BJP has started saying the same things that Manmohan Singh used to say
 bijepi manmohan ko maun mohan kaha karti thi, ab congress modi ko maun modi kehane lagi he
 i have understood one thing
 bharat main mahangaai se sirf vipaksh main rahete hue ladaa ja saktaa he, kyonki vipaksh main rahete hi is nirmohi or pocketmar antarrashtriya paristhiti kii thik se dhulaai ho sakati he
 For example, Prakash Javadekar Saheb, as the sharp spokesperson of the opposition, used to say that the government was charging Jiziya tax from the people on increasing the price of petrol diesel
 yah bilkul sweekaar karne yogya nahin he
 The government's argument that prices have increased due to international prices is wrong
 yah sarkaar logon ko kitna luutegi
 Now Prakash Javadekar has become a minister, but the public did not vote against the international situation, so on the rise in prices of petrol-diesel and non-subsidized cylinders, he says inflation is the problem, but as we know that we This problem is inherited
 upie sarkaar ne das saal main kya kiya he, logon ne dekha he
 The issue of inflation is not the electric switch that it turned on and off
 iske peeche kuch antarrashtriya paristhitiyaan bhi hai
 In 2011, Pranab Mukherjee said that the government cannot spin a magic wand to remove inflation
 saal 2014 ke june main is jaadu kii chadi kaa naam electronic switch ho gaya he
 Is there any politician who can tell in a reliable way about the causes of inflation and our compulsions or powers to overcome inflation in front of such rhetoric? kya aapane apane aas-paas yaa rishtedaari main kisi jamaakhor ko dekha he
 These are the cracks in the national situation, which will be expected to reduce inflation as soon as caught
 hindustan kii sari sarkaar in jamaakhoron ko khoj rahi he, ek duusare ko nirdesh de rahi he ki tum pakado to tum pakado
 Before they are caught, Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi has urged the states to arrange special courts for hoarding cases
 or is kamabakht yani nauti pyaaj kii to puuchhiye mat ise to jaise har sarkaar se chidh he
 During UPA, Anand Sharma used to say that onion prices have increased due to hoarders
 kai congressi netaaon ne bijepi samarthak jamaakhoron ko kaaran bataaya tha
 Sheila Dixit government minister Haroon Yusuf had then accused the Madhya Pradesh government that onion prices were rising due to lack of proper action against hoarders
 ab sarkaar badal gai he to aaj sutron ke hawaale se bijepi ne kaha ki yah congressi jamaakhoron kaa kaam he
 Sources were also used to say this
 aakhir kab tak dilli sarkaar pyaaj bechney kii vyavastha karti rahegi or kya ye pyaaj ke daam sirf dilli main mahange ho rahe hai
 In 2011, when similar raids were taking place in Delhi, traders went on strike
 tab vyapaariyon ne kaha tha ki sarkaar ham vyapaariyon ko jamaakhor kahkar badnaam kar rahi he
 This time there is no news of any such feelings of traders being hurt in the national interest
 aaj dilli ke uparajyapal ne 52 timen banaakar rajya bhar main chaape maar kar pyaaj, aalu, daal, khaadya telon ko pakad kar laane ke liye chhod diya
 According to the press release, these 52 Ashwamedhi teams raided 549 targets and registered cases against 104 people during the day
 pakade gaye ye jamaakhor congressi hai yaa bhaajapai iskaa to zikr nahin he, magar 12000 quintal daal or chaaval ke gaiyrkanoonee stock pakade jane kii soochna he
 On June 19, 532 locations were raided in Delhi and cases were filed against 42 people
 kendriya khaadya or aapurti mantri ramvilas paswan ne kaha he ki hamaare paas chaaval, gehun, chini, aalu or pyaaj kii koi kami nahin he
 Paswan says that whoever hears in TV, in the newspaper that the monsoon has reduced, he starts hoarding
 lekin paswan ji vahi jamaakhor tivi main yah sun kar kyon nahin darataa he ki sarkaar unhen khoj rahi he
 Paswan said that on July 4, a meeting of food ministers across the country has been called
 ek maheenaa pehle hi to desh bhar main hording lage the, jisamen narendra modi kaa naaraa likhaa tha ki ab nahin sahenge mahangaai kii maar
 But it seems from the statements that it is more than the public that the government is bearing the brunt of inflation
 modi sarkaar ne pichley 17 dinon main monsoon or mahangaai par padane vaale asar ko lekar chaar badi baithken kii hai
 The three meetings are chaired by the Prime Minister himself
 iske alaava bhi khaadya va upabhokta maamalon ke mantralay or krishi mantralay main kai baithke hui hai, lekin rigelt kya niklaa he? march 2011 main narendra modi ne tatlakilan pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko 20 suzav die the or 64 kadam bataae the, jo liye ja sakate the
 That is, there is a formula, but where is that action
 agar ection he to mahangaai kyon he? Finance Minister Jaitley has said that inflation is more than the tolerance limit
 to janata kya kare? vah in bayanon se apni khiz nikaale yaa bazaar se laut ghar lautakar arthshaastra kii koi kitaab padhe yaa phir mahangaai kam hone kaa aasraa chhod hi de

 padhie puri baatcheet:sawaal: ishkiyapa ke naam se saaf he ki yah nae daur kii lav story he
 But in a little detail, what is the background of the book? Pankaj: When i say a new round, it is a completely new phase
 jab se internet par duniya basane lagi
 Orkut came, it crumbled and then Facebook and Twitter came
 to us daur kii kahani he
 This is Bihar where the kidnapping industry is flourishing
 patna main ek hero he, ek heroin he
 The name of the hero is Lallan Jha
 vah nae nae bijness shuru karata he, par fail hota rahata he
 Heroine is the daughter of a kidnapping mafia legislator and then a minister
 naam he sweety pandey
 She is in a sleeping cage, but wants freedom
 uske bade-bade mumbai drims he
 The boy's family has a motor driving school business, which he does not want to do
 ek din ladki kaa driving seekhney kaa man karata he
 So the phone goes to the best driving school in the city
 to fadar sahab lallan jha ko bhej dete hai ki jaao mantri sahab kii bitiyaa ko driving sikhaao
 Lallan sees an opportunity to reach out to the minister and tell him his business ideas
 phir klach par pair rakhkar brake or excilator dabaakar shuru ho jaataa he ishkiyapa jo patna se mumbai tak chalata he
 The background of the story is completely fictional, but discerning readers will connect it to the right place

 Trying to shoot in winter
 november se farvari ke bich main
 Shooting will be done in Delhi only

 The rest of the picture has to be made
 jab tak todenge nahin, chodenge nahin
 Question: It has just been Hindi Day
 hindi kaise aage badhegi ise lekar logon kii alag-alag raay he
 What kind of Hindi are you in favor of? Pankaj: i am in favor of Hindi, not river, but Hindi
 kisi ko sangrakshak banane kii jarurat nahin he
 Hindi is the water of the river, which flows through different cultures of land, always in despair
 kuch log bevajaah local gargian ban jate hai
 Hindi is very big and rich
 main maanata hum ki yah suvidha or baatcheet kii bhashaa he
 It has to be kept from the grip of the mandarins
 sawaal:kau belt ilaake ke pathak ke potential ko kaise aankate hai?pankaj:aseemit sambhaavnaaen hai vahaan
 Because even now we are very aware of literature and language
 ab bhi unka karpt hona baaki he
 His path to see metropolitan and foreign things passes through books and media tools
 desh ke jo chote shahar hai, ve zyada bade hai
 There is a fertilizer reader base
 vividhta he
 There are many layers
 aap dilli or mumbai ke mal kaa close shot le lijie, ek jaisaa lagegaa
 But people recognize Lucknow and Bhopal by roads
 kamaal ke hai chote hai shahar
 i come from a small town myself
 main jameen se judaa hua nahin, jameen main gada hua hum
 We get fodder for our creations only from small cities
 chote shaharon main badi takat he
 Q: How important are the one liners to write fun fiction? How do you use them? Pankaj: Very important
 dilachasp hon
 Do not be boring
 lekhak ke liye chalanging kaam hai
 If your point is not interesting then the reader has a wealth of options
 aapane ek vaakya main uskaa dimag chaat liya to vah aapako nahin padhegaa
 But take care that the oneliners are not meaningless, their wires are connected to the plot of the story
 masalan aap kahen ki vednaa main ek shakti he jo drushti detii he
 This reader will not understand
 usko bataanaa hoga ki brallep main ek shakti he
 He knows that it hurts when a breakup occurs
 sawaal:aapane kitna ishkiyapa kiya he?pankaj:kaaphi kiya he
 Has been a lifestyle
 main sakaaratmak flert kaa bhi pakshdhar hum, kyonki vah aapke dimag ko alert or creative rakhata he
 Impressing a girl requires a lot of hard work and sense of humor
 vaise bhi ladkiyaan bahut chuji hai aajkal or unki ummiden bahut hoti hai
 You have to live up to them
 mujhe isse rachanaatmak bane rahane main madad milti he
 Question: Some stories of your Ishkiyape? Pankaj: Yes, i remember an anecdote
 ek bas stop par ek khubasurat ladki dikhi
 The name was Bindiya
 unheen ke naam ko lujar kii nayika banaaya maine
 Yes, she was standing at the bus stop, so i went to her and said that we seem to have met somewhere
 to vah palatakar boli, 'nahin basikali aapako mujhase baat karne kaa man tha
 'if my theft was caught, i obeyed, taking the path of honesty
 thodi bahut baat hui, maine poocha ki kal milenge kya? usne kaha ki meraa boyfriend he
 i said that i have no problem with this, i am open hearted
 wo kuch boli nahin, bas main baith gai
 Then DDLJ came
 bas ravaanaa hote-hote maine kaha ki main intjaar karuunga kal
 The next day i reached the bus stop wearing ironed friends' clothes
 dekhtaa hum ki wo khadi hui he
 When i asked, i started saying, 'I closed eyes and asked Lord Ganapati if i should go? So they said go son
 ' bas tab se ganesh ji mere bhi fevorett bhagwaan ho gaye
 Question: Who are the favorites among contemporary writers? Pankaj: There is not much time to read
 prabhavit hone kaa khatra bhi rahata he
 There is no such favorite
 acha bura kisi ko kaise bol saktaa hum
 What do we need someone to do? hamaare paas hamaari sarkaar
 Question: Five tips for boys who have not had girlfriends? What to do and what not to do? Pankaj: - First of all it is necessary to go to the restaurant, etc
, then pay it to the boy
 iske liye khud aarthik rup se sampann banaaen
 i do not know how to make it
 - ho sake to guitar bajaanaa bhi jarur seekhen
 Girls love it - it is also important to know photography
 ladakiyon ko photo khinchane kaa shauk hota he
 If you take a good photo, the girls will come close
 unako permanent photographer mil jayega
 - Do not become a face to face girl
 dhairya rakhen
 Will be welfare
 - agar ladki bahut hi zyada pasand aa rahi he ki use pataana hi pataana he to us par dhyaan na dekar, uski saheli par dhyaan dijie
 Praise her friend every time
 ye bada kargar tarika he

 mukhyamantri ke saath donon upmukhyamantri keshav prasad maury or dow dinesh sharma bhi is baithak main shaamil honge
 Earlier on Friday night, BJP national president Amit Shah also met RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat
 saath hi grahamantri rajnath singh bhi baithak main shaamil honge
 The Chief Minister will reach Vrindavan by helicopter from Lucknow on Saturday at 11 am
 yahaan ve aresas kii samanvay baithak main do ghante tak rahenge
 Chief Minister Yogi will leave for Lucknow at around 12 noon
 mukhyamantri ke aagaman ko lekar suraksha ke pukhta intjaam kiye gaye hai
 a large number of police personnel have been deployed for their security
 ise bhi padhein :- faggan singh kulaste bole- amit shah ke kehane par diya istifabta den ki isse pehle shuukravaar ko bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah or sanghathan mahaamantri raamalaal ne bhi is baithak main shirkat kii thi
 The meeting discussed the economic weakness of Pakistan and China
 samanvay baithak main sangh ne jiesti or notebandi par sarkaar kaa samarthan kiya
 However, the association admitted that GST has hurt small traders
 iske alaava samanvay baithak main 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ko lekar bhi charchaa hui
 ALSO READ: Amit Shah in Vrindavan: Sitting in the last row of the Sangh, bjp's most powerful insiders told that Amit Shah would meet RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat at around 10 pm on the first day of the rss's All India Coordination meeting
 He went to his room after eating
 donon netaaon ke bich keshavdham main kareeb aadhe ghante tak gahan baatcheet hui
 After the resignation of several ministers from the Union Cabinet, BJP President Amit Shah is considered to be very important to attend the coordination meeting
 aisi atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai ki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah sangh pramukh ko mantrimandal ke vistaar ke bare main jaankaree denge
 One of the conditions mentioned in this new law to be entitled to reservation was that the annual income of the candidate should not exceed eight lakh rupees annually
 lekin vipaksh ne is mudde ko lekar sarkaar kii kadaa aalochana kii, kyonki inakam tex kii maujuuda daron ke mutabik, aath lakh rupee kii aay waalon se 20 fisadi iskar vasula jaataa he
 The opposition said that the person who is giving a fifth of his earnings to the government in the form of income tax, how can he be considered economically weak, or in other words what the government is referring to as 'poor' in the reservation law
 How can she collect 20 per cent tax from it
 sutron ke anusaar, isi aalochana kaa sateek jawaab dene ke liye vittamantri is bajet main karmukt aay kii seemaa ko badhaakar paanch lakh rupee kar sakate hai, jo maujuuda samay main sirf 2
 5 lakhs
 iske atirikt inakam tex act kii dhara 80 si ke tahat nivesh par di jane vaali karmukt aay kii seemaa ko bhi 1
 From Rs 5 lakh can be increased to Rs 3 lakh, so that those earning up to eight lakh rupees do not have to pay any kind of tax
 iske alaava, sutron kaa kahana he, iskar slab main parivartan kii maang bhi lambe arase se kii ja rahi hai, lekin philhal unamem badlaav kii koi gunjaaish nahin he, kyonki agar uparokt praavdhaan kar die jate hai, or karmukt aay kii seemaa ko vastav main dhai lakh rupee se badhaakar paanch lakh rupee kar diya jaataa he, to sarkari khajaane par iskaa khaasaa prabhaav padane ke asaar hai, so, philhal inakam tex slab main kisi tarah kaa parivartan is vakt nahin kiya jayega
 At present, no tax is levied on income up to Rs 2
5 lakh, while five per cent on income ranging from Rs 2
5 to Rs 5 lakh, 20 per cent on taxable income ranging from Rs 5 to 10 lakh and income above Rs 10 lakh
 But 30% income tax has to be paid
 ab sutron se mili khabar ke mutabik, agar paanch lakh rupee tak kii aay karmukt kar di jaati he, to bharat main inakam tex kii slab main swatah parivartan ho jayega, or nimnatam slab hi 20 fisadi kaa ho jayega, jo paanch lakh rupee se adhik kii aay par dena hota he
 Sources have said that even after this, those saving under Section 80C will have the right to reduce the amount up to three lakh rupees from the taxable income, so that no tax has to be paid on income up to eight lakh rupees
 ek jhooth ko chupaane ke liye hajaar jhooth bolne padate hai
 Shoaib Malik also lied a lot during the affair with Sania
 is khel main unka saath diya hone vaali patni sania mirza or bahanoi imran jafar ne
 The three together told a total of 23 lies
 jhooth number 1meraa nikaah nahin hua he
 
 
 Lie No
 2 did not meet the girl with the photo
 
 
 jhooth number 3aaysha se kabhi nahin mila
 
 
 Lie number 4 obeyed Nikah when she told him
 
 
 jhooth number 5aapa ko bhala kaise talaak duun
 
 
 Where is lie number 6, Aisha, why not come forward 
 
 duniya ke sabase paak rishte ko shoeb ne apane jhooth se sharmasaar kar diya
 How can it be so good that a man opens his mouth as many times as he can to say a new thing
 ek ladki ko kabhi wo apni patni kahe or phir usee ladki ko pahachaane bhi nahin
 But, Shoaib Malik did it
 shoeb kabhi to muskuraakar hyderabad ko apni sasuraal kah dete hai (hyderabad meri patni kaa shahar he
 
 
 - Date - 30
 03
 05) And sometimes Sharma tells Ayesha his wife (you will get killed, Ayesha is my wife
 
 
 -taarikh- 27
 09
 04)
 But, when someone else liked, Shoaib's lyrics changed
 jis aaysha ko unhone kabhi apni patni maan liya tha, ab us aaysha se rishton ko lekar hi shame aati he
 If someone reminds me of old things, Shoaib says clearly that he told the matter of marriage under the pressure of Ayesha (he said it and i said it
 
 
 -taarikh- 01
 04
 10)
 Now what is it to be understood? ek rishte kaa bhala isse bada majaak or kya ho saktaa he
 How can a relationship be more damned than this? shoeb ne ek ladki se pehle shaadi kii or phir usase inkaar kar diya
 Do not deny it like that, do not be shy to call your wife as public sister (how do i divorce my temper
 
 
 -taarikh- 05
 04
 10)
 In a relationship, Shoaib told many such lies
 lekin jhooth chaahe kitne bhi bole jaaen, sachai ek naa ek din saamne aakar hi rahati he
 It was proved that Shoaib Malik lied and lied
 ek ladki se shaadi kii
 Then he did not know how many lies to deny marriage
 shoeb ne apni patni ko bahan tak kah daalaa
 Lie No
 7 i did not marry
 
 
 agar nikaah hua nahin, to phir talaak kaise de diya
 You asked for a lot of evidence regarding marriage, at the time of divorce, you were a witness
 shoeb or aaysha ke talaak se shoeb ke jhooth kaa pardaafash ho gaya
 To avoid the marriage which he constantly denied, he also divorced
 ab wo khud hi ye bataa den ki jab nikaah hua hi nahin, to talaak kaise ho gaya
 Lie No
 8 Nikahnama people did not understand Shoaib's lies about Athanikah were exposed in the same press conference in which he had come to explain his truth
 wo kehete hai ki maine nikaah nahin kiya, haa nikaahnaame par dastakhat jarur kiye
 My signature in lie number 9 nikahnama
 Now tell Shoaib why if he did not marry, why did he sign the nikahnama? ulte aaysha ko chunauti ki sabit karo ki shaadi hui thi
 Lie number 10 if married, then prove that now a girl who is upset is seeing that her husband is going to marry her friend
 or upar se chunauti aisi ki sabit karo ki shaadi hui thi
 Ayesha also claimed that now do not test patience, the evidence is such that you will not be able to hear
 aaj tak se baat karte hue aaysha ne kaha tha ki bahut bada saboot he, majaboor mat karo
 
 
 (date - 04
 04
 10) What to say about Shoaib's lies
 wo to ye bhi kehane se nahin chookte ki aapa ko talaak kaise de duun
 How can i divorce Aapa number 11 
 
 jhooth kaa labaadaa odhe-odhe shoeb to ye bhi sach bhul gaye the ki jis maha ko wo aapa-aapa kah rahe the, usee maha se unka nikaah hua tha
 Now Shoaib should decide when he tells the truth and when he lies
 wo kya sach bolte hai or kya jhooth
 They have only provoked a relationship, they have harassed a girl
 ab to sawaal ye uth rahe hai ki kya itane dinon tak wo duniya ko bhi bevakoof banane kii koshish karte rahe
 Shoaib Malik refused to even identify the Ayesha with whom he married
 aaysha ke sawaal par wo yahi kehete ki kabhi mili hi nahin
 But, how could a lie be digested? aaysha ke liye bole gaye shoeb ke chaar jhooth camere par bhi pakade gaye
 Shoaib had said in his press conference that the person who has the picture could not be found
 
 
 (taarikh - 05
 04
 10)isi press conference main shoeb yah bhi kaha ki photo vaali ladki ko to wo aapa kehete the
 Lie number 12 used to call the girl with the photo Apa
 
 
 ek baar ko ye bhi maan len ki wo is photo vaali ladki ko bina mili hi aapa kehete the
 But, this lie has more legs right now, and truth lies in every foot
 aaysha ke ghar waalon ne shoeb ko khuli chunauti di thi ki wo saamne aaen or ye bataaen ki jedda or hyderabad main wo kis aaysha se mili the
 Shoaib said that he never met Ayesha
 jhooth number 13maha aapa koun hai, aaysha se nahin mila ajtak
 
 
 (date - 05
 04
 10) He is the same Shoaib, who used to shy and smile while calling Ayesha his body a few years ago
 27
 09
 04 ko die gaye apane ek saakshaatkaar main shoeb ne kaha tha ki meri shaadi ho chuki, uskaa naam aaysha he
 When Shoaib was asked why he did not show the picture that was sent to him, his answer is that we did not get such education from the family
 jhooth number 14parents ne aisa nahin sikhaaya
 
 
 (date - 05
 04
 10) The question then also arises, who taught them how to lie like this
 rishte ko yun badnaam karnaa kisne sikhaaya
 It has been decided that you knew Ayesha and you also married her
 phir us rishte se inkaar kiya to kyon
 a girl kept making fun of her troubles and Shoaib kept on telling lies
 shoeb ke is jhooth main unki hone vaali bivi number tu sania mirza ne bhi jamkar saath diya
 Sania even forgot that Ayesha was one of her closest friends ever
 camere main kaid hue sania ke chaar jhooth
 Lie number 15 i have known Shoaib for 6-7 years
 
 
 rishton ke is trikon kaa sabase vicitra sach yahi he ki sania jis shoeb ko 6-7 saal se jaanane kaa daawa karti he, aaysha ne usee shaks se shaadi kaa daawa kiya tha
 Now the question arises that if Sania had known Shoaib for so many years, then would she not have known that he was fond of her very good friend Ayesha
 jhooth number 16ve aar shocked
 i don't know why she is doing like this
 matlab ye ki sania ko shoeb or aaysha kii shaadi kaa pataa nahin tha lekin hyderabad ke isi press conference main shoeb ne kaha tha ki unhone sania ko sabakuch bataa rakhaa he
 Lie number 17 i have told Sania everything
 
 
 sania ne bhi mana tha ki unhen pataa he ki sach kya he
 Lie number 18 i know what the truth is
 
 
 to sawaal ye he ki phir jhooth koun bol rahaa he
 Shoaib says that he has told everything
 sania kahati hai ki unhen sab pataa he
 Yet she does not believe that Ayesha and Shoaib were married
 sach ab sabake saamne he
 The question is if these truths were already in front of Sania, then why did she do the drama of becoming unknown
 agar aaysha or shoeb ke rishton ke bare main jaanakar bhi wo unase shaadi karnaa chaahati thim, to ye unka faisla tha
 But no one gave him the right to laugh at Ayesha like this
 naa ye unke rishton ko manjuur he or naa hi insaaniyat ko
 Shoaib got caught in the trap of lies, so his family came to cut the trap with the scissors of lies
 lekin wo khud apane hi bayanon main funs gaye
 Lie No
 19 Shoaib's brother-in-law, Imran Zafar, said that there was no marriage
 
 
 shoeb malik ne khud mana ki nikaahnaame par unke dastakhat hai lekin unke bahanoi jo unka saath dene dilli tak pahunch gaye, kehete hai ki dastakhat hai hi nahin
 Lie No
 20 Shoaib's brother-in-law Imran Zafar said that there were no signatures
 
 
 jhooth bolnaa hi tha, to kam se kam ek-duusare se baat to kar lete, taaki sab ek jaisi baaten kar saken
 Imran said that there is no witness to the marriage and no evidence
 jhooth number 21shoeb ke bahanoi imran jafar ne kaha gavaah nahin he
 
 
 Lie No
 22 Shoaib's brother-in-law Imran Zafar told the media where is the evidence
 
 
 jija-saale ke is jhooth kaa pardaafash kiya isi parivaar ke ek sadsy shoeb ke sautele bhai ne
 He says that he was married to Ayesha
 shoeb ke sautele bhai tarik malik kaa kahana tha ki nikaah hua tha, main uskaa gavaah hum
 Lie No
 23 Shoaib's brother-in-law Imran says that Ayesha is not an issue in Pakistan
 
 
 pakistan main is masale par charchaa garam he
 From the law to the social streets, there was a loud voice for Ayesha
 or khud imran bhi isliye yahaan pahunche the ki wo shoeb ko bachaa saken lekin ye jhooth bolne vaale bhala in sachhee baton ko kahaan samaj paaenge

 In the government of former Gujarat Chief Minister Shankar Singh Vaghela and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Afzal had also saved fake sims in the name of Union Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha
 isi ke chalate jab adhikariyon par in numbers se phone aata to ve dabaav main aa jate
 The pressure created by calling up to the Deputy Chief Minister, the confidence of Afzal Chaudhary had increased so much that he once called up the Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma in the Yogi government and even complained about the officials not working
 iske baadaup-mukhyamantri dinesh sharmaane jab gajiabad ke SSP se poocha ki vah yashavanth sinha kii baat kyon nahin sun rahaa to SSP ne phone karne vaale vyakti ke farji hone kaa shaq jataayaa
 When the Ghaziabad authorities got suspicious, they investigated and the whole reality came to light

 Maken had earlier said that he wants to bring BCCI under the purview of RTI and for this he is also ready to consider bcci's objection to certain provisions of the National Sports Development Bill
 bisisiai ke upaadhyaksh rajeev shukla ne kaha ki board ke khate unki website ke jariye saarvajanik ho chuke hai
 He said, 'maken should know what is happening at the ground level
 vah kuch bhi nahin jaanate
 All information is available on our website
 isaliye kuch bhi chupaane kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 After every general annual meeting, our accounts are communicated to the media

 We have also gone to the Income Tax Department with our accounts
 yah paardarshita he
 He said that it is not possible to bring BCCI to RTI because people will start asking questions about anything and everything from it

 unhone kaha, ‚Äòvittamantri ne kal sansad main bataaya ki bisisiai ne 249 karod rupaye kar ke rup main chukaaye hai
 All our officials are honorary, stadiums are for the people and not for the federations

 E-mail is being sent by the Regional Provident Fund (PF) offices to the private firm of Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai for information and all the information has been asked to be sent within 24 hours of receiving the mail
 gauratlab he ki nijee companiyon main aarakshan dene kii kai sansthaaen maang karti rahi hai, aise main is tarah ke aankade maange jane se phir se kayaas uthne lage hai ki sarkaar aakhir aisi jaankaree kyon chaahati he
 An HR consultant has confirmed to our associate publication Business Today that several companies in Delhi and Chennai have received similar emails from the PF office
 haalanki kansaltent ne kaha ki mumbai or pune ke unke graahakon ne aise kisi mail na milane kii baat kahi he
 But the founder of an HR consultancy based in Delhi said that apart from Bengaluru and Chennai, his clients based in Delhi have also received such emails
 yah notification kisi ek sector yaa industry se sambandhit nahin he, balki yah kisi kshetreey pief karyaalay ke tahat aane vaali sabhi companiyon ko bheja gaya he

 Not only this, companies receiving e-mail have been asked to give details in just one day i
e
 within 24 hours
 companiyon ke liye mushkilis mail se companiyon ke liye mushkil bhi khadi ho gai he, kyonki zyaadaatar nijee companiyon ke paas karmchaariyon kaa jati aadhaarit aankada nahin hota
 An HR head said, "this is the initial thing right now, most companies have replied in the mail that they do not collect such data and they need time to give this information
" 'ek grosri form kii echaar head ne kaha ki unhen to aisa koi mail nahin mila he, lekin ab aage ve apane bhartee form main hi karmchaariyon kaa puraa vivaran hasil karengi
 In the Marufganj Sarrafa market in Patna City, the BJP badge was talking to an old worker that many traders came out of the front shop
 in logon ne hamaari baat bich main roak di or us ilaake main jamaane se jeet rahe bijepi ke varisht netaa nandakishor yadav kii aalochana karne lage
 When someone got out of there, seeing the mike in hand, many people stopped that they wanted to talk about Nandkishore Yadav
 ye dekhie ilaake kii kya haalat he
 Where have they done any work
 sivaan se sate bindusaar gaanv main shahanwaaz ne bataaya ki gaanv ke naujavaanon kii baithak bulaai he
 Only then will we decide who to vote for
 kaaran poochne par shahanwaaz ne kaha ki are sar, ham logon par rajd ke voter hone kaa tag lag gaya he
 Due to this, the number of electricity in our village has not been reached
 ek number matlab shahar se diarect line, jisase bees ghante bijli milti he
 The boys said this
 kehane laga ki bijepi ke saansad kah rahe hai ki vot dene par line change kara denge
 It was from Siwan that a friend told on whatsapp that a team of 200 boys from Mumbai and Delhi in Araria's Sikti assembly has declared a boycott vote for backwardness
 aara main ladke yah mudda uthaanaa chaahate hai ki railway main bhartiyon kyon nahin nikal rahi hai
 Some boys in Patna said that the condition of higher education is not good
 gaanvon main bhi shiksha kii gunvattta ko lekar shikaayatein sunne ko milin
 Can you fit these voices in the casteist groove? The channels may have given place to such voices, but the chaos of the hundred or two hundred people who were deposited on the artificial set was lost in the uproar
 pravaktaa jo man main aa rahaa he bol rahe hai
 People are tearing their kurta with their question, as if the issue has arisen due to screaming
 raajnneetik dalon ne apni sari urja gaay or bakrii main kharch kar di
 After the election results of Bihar will be seen and appreciated in the national context, but Bihar has lost a great opportunity
 aisa nahin he ki akhabaaron ne janata ke mudde nahin chaape balki partiyon ne chaturaai dikhaane ke alaava kuch nahin kiya
 Those issues were printed and turned into junk
 shiksha chikitsa yaa kuposhan jaise masalon par koun bahes ke liye taiyaar tha? har chunaav ko koun banegaa mukhyamantri, qissa kursi kaa yaa satta kaa rajtilak tip ke kaaryakramon tak simit kar diya ja rahaa he
 Nobody is talking about basic issues
 chunaav aate hi enjio yaa tatasth naagarik sanghathan sakriy ho jate hai, lekin sunata koun he
 Keep talking about malnutrition, and the public is busy with emotional issues like beef
 media uthaata to he, lekin swasthya chikitsa ke mudde mukhya raajnneetik vimarsh nahin ban pate
 The leaders are not serious about the difference between the education policy of the central government and the education policy of the state government
 kuch patrkaar or kuch log awaz uthaane kii jagah khojate rahete hai
 The media has become a complex of corporate, political parties
 pehle bhi tha, lekin ye majboot hua he
 Election and election coverage have become part of the gimmick
 aisa lag rahaa he ki kisi ko baaki kshetron keummidavaar se matlab hi nahin
 The work of the winning candidates of both the parties was not reviewed
 log donon pakshon ke vidhayakon se naaraaz hai
 What has been contributed by local legislators in legislative work is never discussed
 is baar maine apni reporting badal di
 When elections were to be contested on sentimentality issues, except for basic issues, i began to look for examples of symbiosis within the society
 us bihar ko khojane laga jo in ranneetikaron kii samaj se baahar he
 The leaders were going to speak Satan, malevolent and beef by blowing a helicopter of crores of rupees
 bihar kaa chunaav uski pahchaan par hamale kaa mauqaa ban jaataa he
 The area that controls the resources here also gets attacked from within, whereas the condition of education and medicine has worsened
 kisi kii sarkaar bane, patna ke baahar bane nursing home main marizon se jo lut ho rahi he wo koun band karegaa? kya wo tabaqa ise luutraj kehane ke liye taiyaar he? kya jo lut rahaa he wo samaj paa rahaa he ki jati main fanse to in luteron ko or bhi chhot milegi, kyonki is lut main har jati ke log shaamil hai
 Ever since election management has become a game, fake issues are being created
 copiriter kisi ek bade mudde kii talash main rahete hai or netaa use hi gita-quran maanakar chunaav bhar japate rahete hai
 Reservation-reservation or beef-beef
 bade-bade hording par ek netaa or ek naaraa hota he
 This has eliminated the diversity of elections
 acha he ki log apane str par is vividhta ko bachaae hue hai
 We, the media, were not broadcasters of public voice in the elections
 netaa un awaazon ko jagah nahin dete
 Two hundred rupees a kilo is pulses and pulses are not an issue on forums
 log sharaab se pareshaan he or sharaab mudda nahin he
 Large sections of the public have also been trained in the same way as to who will win
 koun pradhanmantri yaa mukhyamantri banegaa? Morning was leaving from Patna's Maurya Hotel
 do ladke mili
 Took selfie and told myself about marketing a newspaper
 donon hotel main tehre ek jati vishesh ke netaa se milane ja rahe the
 These leaders have just emerged
 maine poocha ki aap marketing ke hai to inase kyon milane ja rahe hai
 One replied that you did not see that news item in such and such English newspaper of the day
 i remained silent
 ladke ne kaha ki wo idia hamane hi netaa ji ko diya tha
 It is printed only after he speaks
 aaj ham log ek or mudda dene ja rahe hai
 See, if you take it then news can be made
 tippaniyan Now think who is giving the issue to the leader? The issue is more than an idea
 main dilli chunaav main vahaan kii mazdoor bastiyon kii durdasha dikhaata rahaa
 The condition of the people is very bad, but no party gave it a place in their manifesto
 eemaandaaree se baat nahin kii or ek blue print janata ke saamne pesh nahin kiya
 There is a drama in every election to regularize illegal colony
 centre main jisaki sarkaar hoti he wo ek aadesh jari kar detaa he
 Sub zero later
 phir bhi vahaan jaakar apni taraf se mudda uthaane ke liye janata se shaabaashi jarur mili, lekin aksar sochataa hum ki ve mudde raajnneetik vimarsh kyon nahin ban paae? jab banate hi nahin hai to kyon kiya jaae or kab tak kiya jaae? sab lagata he ki vyaktigat shauq ke liye kar rahe hai
 Who is awakening in the name of wake up? Who does not know and does not know, so what did he try to know? karodon rupee kharch kar raajnneetik dal vyaktigat hamale vaale matter akhabaaron main chhapavate hai
 Advertisements of caste leaders appeared on the front page of newspapers every day
 hamen sochna chahie ki raajnneetik dalon ne aisa vigyaapan kyon nahin chapa ki health ko lekar kya-kya kaam karne vaale hai? kya-kya kiya he
 On the other hand, i also saw people leaving these issues and keeping their hearts out to the parties for different reasons
 kahin aisa to nahin ki bihar ne mauqaa ganvaa diya? wo vidhayak se naaraaz hai lekin vot denge kyonki uski pasand kii party jeetni chahie
 So enjoy the victory
 is jeet main jo haar chhipi he wo chunaav ke baad mohabhang main nazar aegi
 In Bindusar village adjacent to Siwan, Shahnawaz told that a meeting of the youth of the village has been called
 uske baad hi tay karenge ki kise vot karnaa he
 On asking the reason, Shahnawaz said, "hey sir, we are tagged as RJD voters
" is vajah se hamaare gaanv kii bijli ek number kii nahin hui he
 a number means a direct line from the city, which provides twenty hours of electricity
 aisa ladakon ne bataaya
 The BJP mps were saying that they would change the line if they voted
 sivaan se niklaa hi tha ki whats ap par kisi mitra ne bataaya ki arriya ke sikati vidhansabha main mumbai or dilli se aae 200 ladakon ke dal ne pichhadepan ko lekar matdaan ke bahishkaar kaa elaan kar rakhaa he
 The boys in Ara want to raise the issue of why recruitments are not coming out in the railway
 patna main kuch ladakon ne kaha ki ucch shiksha kii haalat acchhee nahin he
 Complaints about the quality of education were also heard in the villages
 kya in awaazon ko aap jativaadee khaanche main fit kar sakate hai? channelon ne aisi awaazon ko bhale jagah di, lekin kritrim set par jamaa kiye gaye sau-do sau logon ke hallaa hangaame main kho gai
 The spokesperson who is coming to mind is speaking
 log apana sawaal lekar aise kurta faad rahe he, jaise chikh dene se mudde kaa uth janaa ho gaya
 Political parties spent all their energy in cow and goat
 bihar kaa chunaav nateeja aane ke baad bhale hi rashtriya sandarbh main dekha or saraahaa jayega, lekin bihar ne ek shandaar mauqaa ganvaa diya
 It is not that the newspapers did not print public issues but the parties did nothing but show tact
 ve mudde chhapakar kabad main badal gaye
 Who was ready for debate on issues like education, medicine or malnutrition? Who will become the Chief Minister, every chair or part of the election is being restricted to programs of political type
 buniyadi muddon kii baat koi nahin kar rahaa
 ngos or neutral civic organizations become active as soon as elections come, but who listens
 aap kuposhan kii baat karte rahiye udhar public gomance jaise bhavuk muddon main vyast he
 The media raises, but the issues of health medicine do not become the main political discourse
 centre sarkaar kii shiksha niti se lekar rajya sarkaar kii shiksha niti main kya fark he ise hi lekar netaa gambhir nahin hai
 Some journalists and some people search for a place to raise their voice
 media, karporate, raajnneetik dal kaa ek complex ban chukaa he
 Even before, but it has been strengthened
 chunaav or chunaav kaa kawarej nautanki kaa part banakar rah gaya he
 It seems that no one is meant by the candidates of other areas

 People are angry with the mlas on both sides
 sthaneey vidhayakon kaa vidhaayi kaaryon main kya yogadan rahaa he, isaki to kabhi charchaa nahin hoti
 This time i changed my reporting
 jab buniyadi muddon ko chhod bhavukta muddon par hi chunaav ladaa janaa he to main samaaj ke bheetar sahjivan ke qisson ko khojane laga

 Who should form a government, who will stop the robbery that is being done from patients in a nursing home outside Patna? Is that section ready to call it lootraj?

 jab se chunaav prabandhan kaa khel ban gaya he, naqli mudde gadhe jane lage hai
 Copywriters are looking for a big issue and the leaders keep chanting it as the gita-quran

 It is good that people are preserving this diversity at their level

 Who will be the Prime Minister or Chief Minister? subah-subah patna ke maurya hotel se nikal rahaa tha
 Two boys met
 selfi khinchaai or khud ko kisi akhbaar ke marketing kaa bataaya
 Both were going to meet the leader of a particular caste staying in the hotel
 ye netaa abhi-abhi ubhare hai
 i asked that if you are from marketing, why are you going to meet them
 ek ne jawaab dete hue kaha ki aapane falaan din ke falaan angreji akhbaar main wo news item nahin dekha tha? main chup rahaa
 The boy said that we had given that idea to Netaji
 unke bolne ke baad hi chapa he
 Today we are going to give another issue
 dekhie, agar use lete hai to khabar ban sakati he
 The comments ab sochie netaa ko mudda koun de rahaa he? mudda, mudda nahin ek idia bhar he
 i continued to show the plight of the labor settlements in the Delhi elections

 Did not speak honestly and did not present a blue print to the public
 har chunaav main avaidh colony ko niyamit karne kaa drama hota he
 The one who has government at the center issues an order
 baad main sab zero
 Still, there was praise from the public for going there and raising the issue, but i often wonder why those issues could not become political discussions? When it is not made, why should it be done and for how long? All seem to be for personal hobbies
 jagaane ke naam par kise jagaa rahe hai? kise kya nahin maaloom he or nahin maaloom he to usne jaanane kaa kya prayaas kiya? After spending crores of rupees, political parties get printed in the newspapers with personal attacks
 jatigat netaaon ke vigyaapan har din akhabaaron ke pehle panne par chape
 We should think why the political parties did not publish such advertisements that what are they going to do about health? What have you done? duusari taraf maine logon ko bhi dekha ki ve in muddon ko chhod alag-alag kaarnon se dalon se dil lagaae baithe hai
 Is it that Bihar has lost the opportunity? He is angry with the MLA but will vote because his party of choice should win
 to jeet kaa mazaa lijie
 The defeat that is hidden in this victory will be disenchanted after the election
 sivaan se niklaa hi tha ki whats ap par kisi mitra ne bataaya ki arriya ke sikati vidhansabha main mumbai or dilli se aae 200 ladakon ke dal ne pichhadepan ko lekar matdaan ke bahishkaar kaa elaan kar rakhaa he

 The defeat that is hidden in this victory will be disenchanted after the election
 shiksha chikitsa yaa kuposhan jaise masalon par koun bahes ke liye taiyaar tha? har chunaav ko koun banegaa mukhyamantri, qissa kursi kaa yaa satta kaa rajtilak tip ke kaaryakramon tak simit kar diya ja rahaa he
 Nobody is talking about basic issues
 chunaav aate hi enjio yaa tatasth naagarik sanghathan sakriy ho jate hai, lekin sunata koun he
 Keep talking about malnutrition, and the public is busy with emotional issues like beef
 media uthaata to he, lekin swasthya chikitsa ke mudde mukhya raajnneetik vimarsh nahin ban pate
 The leaders are not serious about the difference between the education policy of the central government and the education policy of the state government
 kuch patrkaar or kuch log awaz uthaane kii jagah khojate rahete hai
 The media has become a complex of corporate, political parties
 pehle bhi tha, lekin ye majboot hua he
 Election and election coverage have become part of the gimmick
 aisa lag rahaa he ki kisi ko baaki kshetron keummidavaar se matlab hi nahin
 The work of the winning candidates of both the parties was not reviewed
 log donon pakshon ke vidhayakon se naaraaz hai
 What has been contributed by local legislators in legislative work is never discussed
 is baar maine apni reporting badal di
 When elections were to be contested on sentimentality issues, except for basic issues, i began to look for examples of symbiosis within the society
 us bihar ko khojane laga jo in ranneetikaron kii samaj se baahar he
 The leaders were going to speak Satan, malevolent and beef by blowing a helicopter of crores of rupees
 bihar kaa chunaav uski pahchaan par hamale kaa mauqaa ban jaataa he
 The area that controls the resources here also gets attacked from within, whereas the condition of education and medicine has worsened
 kisi kii sarkaar bane, patna ke baahar bane nursing home main marizon se jo lut ho rahi he wo koun band karegaa? kya wo tabaqa ise luutraj kehane ke liye taiyaar he? kya jo lut rahaa he wo samaj paa rahaa he ki jati main fanse to in luteron ko or bhi chhot milegi, kyonki is lut main har jati ke log shaamil hai
 Ever since election management has become a game, fake issues are being created
 copiriter kisi ek bade mudde kii talash main rahete hai or netaa use hi gita-quran maanakar chunaav bhar japate rahete hai
 Reservation-reservation or beef-beef
 bade-bade hording par ek netaa or ek naaraa hota he
 This has eliminated the diversity of elections
 acha he ki log apane str par is vividhta ko bachaae hue hai
 We, the media, were not broadcasters of public voice in the elections
 netaa un awaazon ko jagah nahin dete
 Two hundred rupees a kilo is pulses and pulses are not an issue on forums
 log sharaab se pareshaan he or sharaab mudda nahin he
 Large sections of the public have also been trained in the same way as to who will win
 koun pradhanmantri yaa mukhyamantri banegaa? Morning was leaving from Patna's Maurya Hotel
 do ladke mili
 Took selfie and told myself about marketing a newspaper
 donon hotel main tehre ek jati vishesh ke netaa se milane ja rahe the
 These leaders have just emerged
 maine poocha ki aap marketing ke hai to inase kyon milane ja rahe hai
 One replied that you did not see that news item in such and such English newspaper of the day
 i remained silent
 ladke ne kaha ki wo idia hamane hi netaa ji ko diya tha
 It is printed only after he speaks
 aaj ham log ek or mudda dene ja rahe hai
 See, if you take it then news can be made
 tippaniyan Now think who is giving the issue to the leader? The issue is more than an idea
 main dilli chunaav main vahaan kii mazdoor bastiyon kii durdasha dikhaata rahaa
 The condition of the people is very bad, but no party gave it a place in their manifesto
 eemaandaaree se baat nahin kii or ek blue print janata ke saamne pesh nahin kiya
 There is a drama in every election to regularize illegal colony
 centre main jisaki sarkaar hoti he wo ek aadesh jari kar detaa he
 Sub zero later
 phir bhi vahaan jaakar apni taraf se mudda uthaane ke liye janata se shaabaashi jarur mili, lekin aksar sochataa hum ki ve mudde raajnneetik vimarsh kyon nahin ban paae? jab banate hi nahin hai to kyon kiya jaae or kab tak kiya jaae? sab lagata he ki vyaktigat shauq ke liye kar rahe hai
 Who is awakening in the name of wake up? Who does not know and does not know, so what did he try to know? karodon rupee kharch kar raajnneetik dal vyaktigat hamale vaale matter akhabaaron main chhapavate hai
 Advertisements of caste leaders appeared on the front page of newspapers every day
 hamen sochna chahie ki raajnneetik dalon ne aisa vigyaapan kyon nahin chapa ki health ko lekar kya-kya kaam karne vaale hai? kya-kya kiya he
 On the other hand, i also saw people leaving these issues and keeping their hearts out to the parties for different reasons
 kahin aisa to nahin ki bihar ne mauqaa ganvaa diya? wo vidhayak se naaraaz hai lekin vot denge kyonki uski pasand kii party jeetni chahie
 So enjoy the victory
 is jeet main jo haar chhipi he wo chunaav ke baad mohabhang main nazar aegi
 It seems that no one is meant by the candidates of other areas
 donon dalon ke jite ummidavaaron ke kaam kii samiksha nahin hui
 People are angry with the mlas on both sides
 sthaneey vidhayakon kaa vidhaayi kaaryon main kya yogadan rahaa he, isaki to kabhi charchaa nahin hoti

 Ever since election management has become a game, fake issues are being created
 copiriter kisi ek bade mudde kii talash main rahete hai or netaa use hi gita-quran maanakar chunaav bhar japate rahete hai
 Reservation-reservation or beef-beef
 bade-bade hording par ek netaa or ek naaraa hota he
 This has eliminated the diversity of elections
 acha he ki log apane str par is vividhta ko bachaae hue hai
 We, the media, were not broadcasters of public voice in the elections
 netaa un awaazon ko jagah nahin dete
 Two hundred rupees a kilo is pulses and pulses are not an issue on forums
 log sharaab se pareshaan he or sharaab mudda nahin he
 Large sections of the public have also been trained in the same way as to who will win

 The defeat that is hidden in this victory will be disenchanted after the election
 sibiai banamasibiaiki surkhiyon ke bich congress nepradhanmantri narendra modipar bada hamalaa bolaa he
 The Congress has alleged that Prime Minister Modi is responsible for destroying the CBI
 congress ke communication department ke pramukharandeep singh surajevalane ek press conference main kaha,‚Äúbharat kii premier jaanch agency sibiai ko dhahaane or tabah karne ke liye pradhanmantri akele javabdeh hai
 Condemning, contempt, demolishing and destroying institutions is the only agenda of PM Modi
 ‚Äùye pehali baar nahin ki sibiai ko lekar sarkaar aalochanaon ke nishane par he
 In 2013, even under the UPA government's tenure, the CBI had to face strict Supreme Court comment
 supreme court ne tab sibiai ko‚Äòpinjre main kaid aisa tota bataaya tha jo, apane maalik kii aawaaj bolta he
 'there have been allegations earlier that the CBI has been used by the Central governments to pressurize the opposition leaders
 surajevaala ne kaha,‚Äòsibiai ko bijepi kaa darty tricks department bana kar rakh diya gaya he
 Prime Minister Modi and BJP President Amit Shah are habitually using the CBI against their political opponents
 saath hi gambhir aapraadhik maamalon kii nishpaksh jaanch ko prabhavit karne ke liye bhi avaidh dakhal diya ja rahaa he
 All these things have turned the CBI into a big mess
 ‚Äôcongress ne pradhanmantri modi se teen sawaal bhi kiye hai
 1
 pradhanmantri ne kal raat ko sibiai pramukh or research and analysis wing (RAW) ke chif ko kyon apane awaas par bulaayaa tha? kya ye sibiai or ro ke adhikariyon ke khilaaf jari bhrashtachar kii jaanch ko prabhavit karnaa tha? kya ye do agenciyon ke ucch padasth adhikariyon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aaropon kii jaanch main pradhanmantri ke avaidh or asanvaidhanik dakhal ke baraabar nahin tha?2
 Has the role of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) not clouded itself? Why is the CVC withdrawing from the constitutional obligation to punish wrongdoings fairly and decisively? Is there any directive from the political executive to the CVC as well? 3
 kya pradhanmantri vyavasthit dhang se sabhi premier agenciyon ko tabah nahin kar rahe? in agenciyon main sibiai, idi, esaio, sibiditi, enie, iskar vibhaag or anya shaamil hai
 Six such occasions were also cited by the Congress, where the CBI body was allegedly misused by the Modi government
 surajevaala ne daawa kiya,‚Äòmaujuuda raajnneetik kaaryakarini ke sheersh str or do varisht sibiai adhikariyon kii bhoomika ko lekar chupe hue andeh hai
 Surjewala cited these six incidents
 A
 Suppressing the entire business scam and giving a clean chit to Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 B
 Similar questions arose in the Rs 26,306 crore bank robbery scandal involving Mehul Choksi and Nirav Modi
 may 2018 main sibiai ke bank securities or frod cells ke sanyukt nideshak rajeev singh kaa achaanak tabadalaa kar desh bula liya gaya
 C
 isse bhi badi paheli special krimes kii upanideshak nina singh kaa achaanak tabadalaa or sibiai ke do adhikariyon-anish prasad, diaiji or ke gopalkrishna raav, espi ko desh waapas bulaanaa rahaa
 All of them were investigating the Nirav modi-mehul Choksi scam, Ryan school murder case and Shimla rape case
 D
 a special officer in the Godhra SIT, who was constantly skeptical about his role, was brought to the CBI
 E
 The entire nation was shocked on 4 August 2018 when a senior CBI officer was seen talking and shaking hands with fugitive Vijay Mallya in a British court in London
 F
 It is surprising and surprising that a senior officer who is currently posted in the PMO, and who is allegedly accused in the coal scam, was pressurized by the CBI into a witness by someone from the political executive
 in gambhir aaropon, jo piemo se jude hai, kii sachai kii kabhi jaanch nahin kii gai or inhen dabaa diya gaya
 Surjewala finally said, 'the Prime Minister and the top rulers have made the CBI the bjp's dirty tricks department
 idi, iskar vibhaag, sibiditi, esaio, enie anya sansthaaen hai jinhen ‚Äòbandhak kathputliyon‚Äô kii bijepi ke darty tricks department kii tarah istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 ' kendriya mantri jairam ramesh ne chaar din pehle chhattisgarh main congress ke kai netaaon kii hatya karne vaale maovadiyon ko aatankwaadi qaraar dete hue ummid jataai ki jaanboojh kar or yojana banaakar kiya gaya yah narsanhaar unke khilaaf ladaai main ek nirnaayak mode sabit hoga
 The Rural Development Minister said that Maoists should not be romantic because they are terrorists who spread terror
 vah shanivaar ko hue hamale main chhattisgarh ke congress adhyaksh or party ke kuch anya netaaon sahit 27 logon ke maare jane ke bare main baat kar rahe the
 Ramesh, who is generally opposed to taking a tough stand against Maoists, said that Maoists have no faith in the Constitution, democracy or democratic institutions
 unka koi vichaardhaara par aadhaarit maowad nahin he balki yah phiroti par aadhaarit he
 He said that the strategy of the government cannot be taken back, which keeps security and police action and political dialogue at the center
 adivasee vikaas ke muddon kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye vikaas yojanaon par kaam karnaa hoga
 Ramesh said, 'since 2004 till now we have been saying that this is a law and order issue as well as a socio-economic issue
 donon tarah se samaadhaan karnaa hoga
 Taking a dig at the Maoists, he said, "they are terrorists
" chaahe ve jo kuch bhi ho? aap unase narmi nahin barat sakate
 They are spreading fear
 ve aatank failaa rahe hai
 Ramesh said Saturday's incident is not just a homicide
 yah ati nirdayata vaala narsanhaar he
 a political signal is attached to it
 unhone is hamale ke peeche maujuud sandesh ko bayaan karte hue kaha ki unhen lagata he ki yah is bare main sanket he ki maovadi congress or anya raajnneetik partiyon ko bataanaa chaahate hai, ‚Äòyah swatantra kshetra hai, yahaan mat aao, aapkaa raajnneetik samvaad nahin chalegaa, aapaki gram sabha nahin chalegi or reliyaan nahin hongi
 He said that this is an unacceptable situation in India
 unhone kaha ki yadi maovadiyon ko apane par itnaa hi bharosa he to ve kyon nahin chunaav prakriya main bhaag lete? ramesh ne kaha ki garib adivasee maovadiyon or suraksha balon kii banduukon ke bich funs gaye hai

 On July 10, the Mumbai Police discovered six skeletons in the backyard of actress Laila Khan's Igatpuri farmhouse, just 140 km from Mumbai
 is farmahouse main do baar pehle bhi aane ke baavjood use yah kankal khojane main 17 maheene lag gaye
 Laila and her family of five were missing since February 2011
 police tab bhi chaukas nahin hui, jab june 2011 main lagi aag main ghar kaa kuch hissaa nasht ho gaya or farmahouse kaa furniture aasapaas ke gharon main pahunch gaya
 She was not even suspicious of one of Laila's two Persian cats, whom she always took with her
 jammu-kashmir police ne mukhya abhiyukt or laila kii maa shelina patel ke tisare pati 30 varshiya parvej taak kaa pataa lagane ke liye pahal tab kii, jab laila kii car kishtwar, jammu-kashmir main taak ke pita ke garrej main pai gai
 The Jammu and Kashmir police tracked him down to Nepal, where he was hiding, and lured him back for a job
 taak ne kashmir police ko bataaya ki shelina ke duusare pati asif shaikh ne laila kii hatya kar di he
 But when the Mumbai police questioned him, Tak confessed that he and his associate Shakir 'san Wani murdered him
 taak ne mumbai police kii krime branch ke adhikariyon ko bataaya ki usne 29 varshiya laila, uski 50 varshiya maa shelina, laila kii 31 varshiya bahan ajamina, 22 varshiya judwa bhai-bahan jaaraa or imran or 23 varshiya chacheri bahan reshma ko laila ke farmahouse main 9 farvari, 2011 ko maar daalaa tha
 Shelina and Laila ask him to give water to the guests and drive their cars like Honda City, Mitsubishi and Scorpio which makes him feel humiliated
 jab shelina ne apni sampatti kii power of atarni shaikh ke naam karke dubai main basane kii yojana kaa elaan kiya to taak ne kathith taur par khud ko thaga hua mahasoos kiya
 Joint Commissioner of Police (crime) Himanshu Roy said Tak first killed Shelina because of a dispute over property
 roy ne bataaya, ''uske baad taak ne imran or jaaraa ko maar daalaa, jo unase milane aae the
 Then with the help of Vani, the others are killed
 ''police kaa maananaa he ki taak laalach se prerit tha
 Shelina, Laila and Ajmina owned a flat and a clothes shop in Oshiwara, a flat in Mira Road and a farmhouse in Igatpuri
 is sampatti kii kul keemat 6 karod ru
 was
 kankalon kii pushti diene pareekshan ke baad hi hogi
 "we have asked the forensic experts to take DNA samples of Laila's father Nadir Shah Patel and Sheleena's sisters and match them with the skeletal DNA," Roy said
 '' diene jaanch kii report is maheene ke aakhir main aane kii ummid he
 Surprisingly, in September 2011, six months after Laila's father filed a missing complaint for these people, the Oshiwara police arrived at Laila's Sunshine Apartment to investigate the case
 police thana is apartment block se mushkil se 100 meter dur he
 Patel's sister Albana Patel and Shelina's sister Meher Akhtar had reported to the police in August 2011 that Shelina had not contacted them since February, yet the police did not suspect any disturbances
 sitambar 2011 main meher ne police se darkhwaast kii ki farmahouse kii talaashi lee jaae lekin police ne isaki andekhi kar di
 Not only this, in December 2011, Rakesh Sawant, the producer of Laila's 2008 film Wafa, also filed a missing complaint
 police ne unhen yah kah kar waapas bhej diya ki unki shikaayat darj kar lee gai he
 In January, Laila's father alleged that Sheikh and Tak conspired to kill the family
 police ne phir bhi koi karrwai nahin kii
 The police awoke when the media began to speculate about Laila's possible relationship with the terrorist organization lashkar-e-taiba
 mumbai ke ek tabloid akhbaar ne khabar chhaapi ki laila dubai main thi or uski mitsubishi car sitambar 2011 main dilli hycourt ke baahar hue bam visphoton main istemaal kii gai thi
 Inspector General of Police of Jammu region Garib Das immediately denied this report
 lekin maharashtra aatankwaad nirodhi daste (aties) ne is par gaur kiya or laila or taak kii talash main ek dal kashmir bheja
 He did not see the aspect of terrorism, but due to his action, Laila became an issue for the media and in late March this year the police had to start looking for him
 mumbai ke purv police ayukta em
 N
 singh police kaa bachaav karte hue kehete hai ki jab tak kisi gadabadi kaa andeh na ho, police kisi vayask ke bare main gumshudagi kii shikaayat ko gambhirtha se nahin leti
 "there is already a lot of burden on the police," he told India Today
 police har gumshuda insaan ko nahin khoj sakati
 In Laila's case, the whole family was with Shelina's so-called husband
 ve khud apane ghar se nikle the or yah maanane kaa koi kaaran nahin tha ki ve shaayad maare gaye hon
 "they believe that the media has played an important role in the search for Laila
" ve kehete hai, ''taak anya maamalon main vaanchit abhiyuktthaa
 In Laila's case, he came under suspicion when the media presented him as a suspect
 ''aam taur par, police gumshudagi kii shikaayat gumshuda vyaktiyon ke beuro ko de detii he, jo lukout notice jari kar detaa he
 Police search for missing people in hospitals, crematoriums and even their own lock-ups
 agar koi paaya jaataa he, to rishtedaaron ko suchit kar diya jaataa he
 According to data from the Bureau of Missing Persons, an average of 28 people in Mumbai go missing every day
 laila ke farmahouse main kankal kii baramadagi ne uski 85 varshiya daadi kanij phatama ko tod kar rakh diya he, jo mumbai ke bahari ilaake mira road main rahati hai
 She cries, "why did Parvez kill my young children?" What was his fault? "says Albana," Parvez told us that he is very religious and did not like his 'wife' and 'daughters' to act in films
 hamane us par vishwaas karke galati kar di
 Laila's relationship sister Mehnaz Nazim says the family will take a long time to recover from the shock
 upi ke purv mantri amarmani treepathi kii vadhoo sara singh kii maut kaa maamla tool pakadta ja rahaa he
 Sara's mother Seema Singh met Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday and demanded a CBI inquiry into the case
 seemaa ne bataaya ki mukhyamantri ne unhen maamle kii jaanch sibiai se karaane kii anushansa centre ke paas bhejne kaa aashwaasan diya he
 The Firozabad Police has taken care in this matter from the beginning
 mukhyamantri karyaalay aneccemen akhilesh se milane ke baad unhone kaha, 'mukhyamantri se mulaakaat or baatcheet thik thaak rahi

 Opposition leaders had demanded action on complaints related to the alleged transfer of evms from Strongroom to several places

 -PM attacked the Congress leadership and said that this has been the tendency of Congress leaders
 is pravriti main desh kii sanvaidhanik sansthaaon ko party ke aage haath baandhe khadaa rahane par majaboor kiya jaataa he or jo jhukta nahin use todane kii koshish kii jaati he
 The PM said that it is their monarchical thinking that keeps them from ruining the impartial institutions
 piem ne kaha ki haal main hi hamane dekha ki kaise unhone nyaaypalika ke sarvocch nyaayamurti ke khilaaf mahabhiyog prastaav laane kii koshish kii gai
 According to PM Modi, this attempt to intimidate the judges has been part of his old thinking

 gandhi parivaar ke garh se congress par bolaa hamalisse pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi aaj purv congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke garh raibareli pahunche
 This was PM Modi's first visit to UPA President Sonia Gandhi and Rae Bareli, a political fortress of the nehru-gandhi family before him
 raibareli pahunchane par piem modi ne modern coach factory kaa nirikshan kiya
 The Prime Minister inaugurated and laid the foundation stone of projects worth Rs 1100 crore here
 piem modi ne iske baad yahaan par ek jansabha ko sambodhit kiya
 During this, PM Modi attacked the Congress strongly
 raksha saude par bolte hue piem modi ne kaha ki congress ne vayusena ko kabhi majboot nahin hone diya
 In the defense deal case, Congress has a history of Quattrocchi Mama and a few days ago, another accused Michelle Chacha has been brought and we have seen how Congress sent its lawyer to the court to save them
 congress kya isliye bhadki hui he kyonki bijepi sarkaar jo raksha saude kar rahi usamen kwatrochi mamaa or mishael ankal nahin hai
 What did PM Modi say - Congress has been talking big about debt waiver for some time
 karnataka main congress ne kisaanon se karjamaafee kaa vaada kiya tha
 It was said only for 10 days, but today after 6 months, the truth is something else: PM modi-congress ecosystem will never tell you that just by this decision, farmers of the country are set to get 60 thousand crore rupees: PM modi-nda The government implemented the Swaminathan Committee report on MSP to increase farmers' income
 kharif or rabi kii 22 fasalon par MSP ko sunishchit kiya gaya he : piem modi-congress ke paas is baat kaa kya jawaab he ki jab wo das saal tak satta main rahi, to kyon usne swaminathan cameti kii report ko lagu nahin kiya? is baat kaa jawaab congress kabhi nahin degi or na hi uskaa banaaya echosystem usase kabhi ye jawaab maangega: piem modi-centre main hamaari sarkaar banane ke baad 2016 main hamane sena ke liye 50 hajaar bulatopruf jacket kharidi
 i also want to inform the country that in April this year, the order of 1 lakh 86 thousand bullet proof jackets has been ordered
 ye jacket bharat kii hi ek company bana rahi he
 - In 2009, the Indian Army demanded 1 lakh 86 thousand bullet proof jackets
 2009 se lekar 2014 tak paanch saal biit gaye, lekin sena ke liye bulatopruf jacket nahin kharidi gai : piem modi-congress ne vayusena ko majboot nahin hone diya
 In the case of the defense deal, Congress has a history of Quattrocchi Mama and a few days ago another accused Michelle Chacha has been brought and we have seen how Congress sent its lawyer to the court to save them
 congress kya isliye bhadki hui he kyonki bijepi sarkaar jo raksha saude kar rahi usamen kwatrochi mamaa or mishael ankal nahin he
 It is always a country bigger than ours
 piem modi-aaj desh ke saamne do paksh he, ek paksh satya kaa he, suraksha kaa he
 The other side is the forces that want to weaken the country at any cost
 congress un takaton ke saath khadi he jo hamaari senaaon ko majboot nahin hona dena chaahate hai, aise logon kii koshishon ko kin deshon se samarthan mil rahaa he desh dekh rahaa he
 The speech is given here and the applause rings in Pakistan
 kuch logon ke liye raksha mantralay jhootha he, raksha mantri juthi hai, kuch logon ko court bhi jhootha dikhataa he, sach ko shringaar kii jarurat nahin hoti or jhooth jitna bhi bolo usamen jaan nahin hoti he: piem modi-aaj mujhe ye kehete hue gaurav kaa ehsaas ho rahaa he ki aane vaale samay main raibareli, rail coach nirmaan ke maamle main ek global hub banane vaala he: piem modi-itnaa hi nahin, 2014 main hamane ye bhi dekha ki yahaan kii coach factory main ek bhi nai niyukti nahin hui thi
 Now the situation today is that about 2 thousand new employees have been appointed by our government: PM Modi - when the earlier government had decided to build a rail coach factory here, it was decided that 5000 employees were appointed Will go
 lekin sweekruti iske aadhe padon ko hi di gai: piem modi-agar coach factory kii kshamta badhegi to yahaan ke yuvaaon ke liye har tarah ke rojgaar badhenge
 Think of the day when 10-12 new coaches would be made here every day: PM modi-deb metro coaches will be built in the coach factory of Rae Bareli: PM Modi-this factory was approved in 2007
 2010 main ye factory banakar taiyaar bhi ho gai, lekin uske baad 4 saal tak is factory main kapoorthala se dibbe lekar unamem pench kasne or paint karne kaa kaam hua:piem modi-jo factory nae dibbe banane ke liye thi, use puri kshamta se kabhi kaam hi nahin karne diya gaya: piem modi- yahaan aane se pehle main paas hi main bani mordan coach factory main tha
 i also flagged off the 900th box made this year at that factory
 pehle kii sarkaron kii kya kaarysamskruti rahi he, isaki gavaah raibareli kii rail coach factory bhi he: piem modi-piem modi ne raashtra ko samarpit kiya 900waan coach or humsafar recopradhanmantri shri@narendramodine raibareli main coach factory main utpaadit 900wein rail dibbe va humsafar rek ko hari jhandi dikhaa kar desh ko samarpit kii

 (inputs ienes se bhi) There is a one-to-one response to the financial crisis of Kingfisher Airlines
 suprasiddh udyogpati rahul bajaj ne is prakaar ke kisi bhi raahat package kaa khulkar virodh kiya he
 The same Shiv Sena has advised the Prime Minister to deal with the common man's problem, not the financial problem of Kingfisher
 is bich nagar vimaan mantri vyalaar ravi ne kaha ki mantralay ke paas is prakaar kaa koi prastaav nahin aayaa he jisamen kingfisher ko raahat package die jane ke vishay par vichaar karne ko kaha gaya ho
 The Shiv Sena has questioned him about Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's statement on Kingfisher Airlines stuck in financial crisis, why he is not taking steps to solve the problems of the common man
 shivasena ke kaaryakari adhyaksh uddhav thakare ne manmohan kii unke is bayaan ko lekar aalochana kii ki vah nagar vimaan mantri vyalaar ravi se baat karenge or dekhenge ki kingfisher sankat ke bare main kya kiya ja saktaa he
 Meanwhile, Civil Aviation Minister Vayalar Ravi said in Kochi that the crisis-hit Vijay Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines has not demanded any relief package from the Center
 ravi ne samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya ki ‚Äòyah mere mantralay ke samaksh nahin aayaa he
 He said that i met Mallya but i could not reveal what he discussed
 mantri ne kal spasht kiya tha ki sarkaar ke samaksh na to is tarah kaa koi raahat package lambit he or na hi kingfisher airlines ke liye naagarik uddyan mantralay ne ise prastaavit kiya he
 On the issue of FDI in civil aviation, he said that it cannot be decided in a day
 prastaav aane par hi ham is par vichaar kar sakate hai
 Help should not be given to private sector: Rahul Bajaj Meanwhile, leading industrialist Rahul Bajaj has said that help should not be given to private sector, 'those who are dying should be allowed to die
 ‚Äô bajaj aato ke pramukh rahul bajaj ne ek tivi channel se baatcheet main kaha ki main nijee kshetra kaa ek swabhimani vyakti hum
 i do not see any logic in helping the government from the private sector company, whether in the interest of employees or customers
 unhone sawaal kiya ki yadi aaj bajaj aato sankat main hoti, to kya aap madad karte
 It is a free economy, those who are dying should be allowed to die
 rahul bajaj kii yah tippanee aise samay ai he jab kingfisher ke chairman vijay maalya ne airline ko ubaarane ke liye sarkaar se madad maangi he
 Kingfisher lost Rs 1,027 crore in 2010-11
 company kaa karj 7,057
 08 crores has reached Rs
 bajaj ne air india ko bhi sarkaar se madad par nakhushi jataate hue kaha ki uskaa nijeekaran kiya janaa chahie
 However, Bajaj too, like Mallya, believed that the condition of the aviation sector was getting worse due to high tax burden
 unhone kaha ki vimaanan kshetra par karon kaa baari boj he

 Desi girl Priyanka Chopra has now become an international star
 lekin bollywood unke dil ke sabase kareeb he
 Recently, Priyanka Chopra had a special chat with Aaj Tak and India Today about her first Hollywood film and explained why she loves being a villain on film screen
 saath hi unhone yah bhi bataaya ki 'quantico' kaa aglaa sijan hoga aayega yaa nahin
 
 
 Tell us about the character of your film 'baywatch'
 1
 In the film, you are not a heroine but a villain? Priyanka Chopra: My character's name is Victoria and i liked this character very much
 main is khyaal se hi behad khush thi ki film main ek ladki 6 logon kii jindagi jahannum bana sakati he
 She is not bad because she wants the bad of others rather it is her job and whoever comes in between her work is killed
 victoria ke liye ye sab ek bijness he or yahi baat mujhe badi kool lagi
 Positive characters are also good but there are more shades in negative characters and you can never do negative things in real life
 priyanka kaa khulaasa-pahenti hai ex-boyfriend kii jacket, maangane par bhi nahin lautaai2
 How is your look in 'baywatch'? Priyanka Chopra: i am glad that in this film i have not worn a swimming costume and neither will i be seen running in the middle of slow motion or else i have to sweat in the gym
 vaise maine kaaphi western outfit pahane hai or hill pahanakar slomoshan main chali bhi hum

 hollywood ke apane safar ko aap kaise dekhati hai ?priyanka chopra:main ek cheez ko lekar bahut clear thi ki main koi chota kirdaar nahin karuungi
 i had full care for my image in Bollywood
 aakhirkaar main bharat ko ripregent kar rahi hum
 There is neither a shortage of talent in India nor we are less than anyone
 baaki ab tak kaa safar bahut acha rahaa he or ummid he aage bhi sahi hoga

 Do you miss speaking Hindi in America? Priyanka Chopra: i only talk to my people in Hindi

 riginal filmon se aapane production kii shuruyaat kyon kii?priyanka chopra:sabase pehle to main plateform set karnaa chaahati thi jo riginal film kii vajah se maine jaldi kar liya or duusari baat kahani kisi bhi jubaan main ho usase koi fark nahin padataa
 a good story does not mean that it should be made only in Hindi
 aaj global cinema kaa daur he har acchhee kahani international str par bhi sarhi jaaegi
 Recently our Marathi film 'ventilator' got three National Awards
 makasad he nae kahanikar, filmmekars ko bhi mauka diya jaae
 The audience only sees the story, whatever it may be
 'bahubali' hindi main dab he lekin kya kamaal kii opening mili he film ko

 wo bijness head hai or main kriyative head hum or kriyetivity ko lekar hamaare bich jabardast jhagade bhi hote hai or aise main sabase zyada kanfusion mere offis main baithe logon ko hota he kyonki kiski taraf se wo bole
 Eventually the mother joins the daughter end

 cement corporation of india ( CCI) main vaikencicchhifaith main naukari paane kaa maukabushnapdil main graduates ke liye vaikency BJP leaders do not want to give CM post to Shiv Sena, BJP has not wanted to give the post of CM
 For two-and-a-half years, the results of the Shiv sena-maharashtra assembly elections have passed, 13 days have passed and only three days are left in the term of the assembly
 But till now the situation on government formation has not been clear
 mulakaaton kaa daur bhi jari he
 BJP seems soft on 50-50 formula, but Shiv Sena and BJP are face to face for the post of Chief Minister
 mangalvaar ko mumbai main mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke ghar par maharashtra bijepi ke bade netaaon kii baithak hui
 After this meeting, the leaders said in unison that BJP under Devendra Fadnavis is going to form government in Maharashtra
 vahiin, shivasena adi hui he ki rajya main 50-50 formule ke tahat dhai-dhai saal ke liye donon partiyon kaa mukhyamantri ho
 It is believed that the BJP agrees that the Shiv Sena should have fifty per cent stake in the ministry, but the BJP will be the chief minister and home minister for the entire five years
 kendriya mantri or endie ke sahyogi ramdaas athawale ne kaha he ki PWD, houseing or rajasav vibhaag jaise ahm mantralay 50-50 formule ke tahat baante ja sakate hai, lekin bijepi siem pad or grih mantralay dene ko raji nahin he
 Athawale said that the Shiv Sena should accept this proposal and change its stand
 haalanki, bijepi ne koi likhit aashwaasan dene se inkaar kar diya he
 On the other hand, Shiv Sena is not in a mood to change its stand and wants written assurances from BJP on the participation of power
 bijepi kii baithak ke baad shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne saaf kaha ki unki party is baat par adig he ki bijepi satta kii bhagidaari par likhit rup main bharosa dilaae or dhai-dhai saal main siem badla jaae
 That is, the BJP may have tried to put a ball in its court by seeking a proposal from the Shiv Sena, but the attitude of the Shiv Sena is still looking tough
 lihaaja, ab sabaki najar nagpur kii taraf he, jahaan bijepi or shivasena donon ne hajiri lagaai he

 What Shoaib Akhtarsiddhu said against Sachin feels that the commentary on Tendulkar and Dravid in the book is an attempt by Akhtar to gain cheap popularity
 unhone sachin kii tulana mandir se karte hue kaha, ‚Äòmandir or masjid ke upar kai panchi udate rahete hai or inhen ganda kar dete hai lekin mandir or masjid hameshaa pavitra rahete hai or unki gand barish se dhul jaati he

 ‚Äô Rajasthan has been witness to direct encounters between the Congress and the BJP since 2003, in which Ashok Gehlot and Vasundhara Raje have alternated as chief ministers
 disambar main hone vaale chunaavon kii kahani bhi isse alag najar nahin aati, alabatta isamen ek chota-sa mode aa saktaa he
 The state BJP is struggling with infighting and Raje himself is embroiled with party president Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 congress ke morche par ek ahm fark is baar pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh ke taur par sachin payalat kii maujuudagi se aayaa he, jo raaje or gahalot, donon ko ek saath lalkaar rahe hai
 Pilot is seen as a leader who has revived the isolated party and Congress during Gehlot's three decades of domination
 is tarah unhone party kii behad jaruri vaapasi kii ummiden bhi paidaa kar di hai, khaskar pichley do chunaavon kii haar ke baad, jab pichley vidhansabha chunaav main party 200 sadasyon kii vidhansabha main mahaj 21 siten jeet saki thi or aam chunaav main vah 25 main se ek bhi loksabhaa seat nahin jeet saki thi
 In contrast to Gehlot's personal attacks against Raje, the pilot's strategy is that he is exposing the failures of the Raje government in important areas and this strategy is also seen to have an impact on voters
 is sabase gahalot or unke vafaadaar jahiraa taur par ghabrahat main najar aa rahe hai
 Sensing the factionalism in the party, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has asked Pilot to take Gehlot along, at least make sure that it appears in public
 congress jaise-jaise ekajute party ke taur par saamne aa rahi he, rajya main charchaa kaa vishay yah he ki aglaa mukhyamantri koun hoga‚Äîgahalot yaa payalat
 This only means that the party can win the election
 jahaan tak bhaajapa kii baat he, to raaje or shah alag-alag chunaav abhiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 State BJP president Madan Lal Saini, however, calls it part of the strategy and an attempt to use resources more and more, but Pilot says the party's conscience has forced him to do so
 sheersh netaaon ke saath takaraav raaje ke puure kaarykaal ke dauraan hi dikhaai detaa rahaa
 The perception in the state unit has become that the High Command put Raje in "switch off mode", despite the fact that she is doing a tremendous tour and touring the entire state
 apni 40 dinon kii suraj gaurav yatra main unhone aisa teesri baar kiya
 On the other hand, Shah is holding meetings at the block level and taking feedback from party workers
 party ke bheetar ek raaje-virdohi lobby he or vah unki naakaara hukumat kaa dhol petakar bhitarghaat main juty he, iskaa pehla sanket tab mila tha jab sitambar 2018 main party loksabhaa ke liye chune gaye vidhayakon ke istife se khaali hui chaar main se teen siton ke upachunaav haar gai thi
 a senior BJP minister says, "within a few weeks, people could not have turned against the ruling party without any reason
" '' ve yah bhi kehete hai ki party ke bheetar apane virodhiyon ke saath-saath ab to unhen payalat se bhi ladanaa he, jo gaiyr-vivaadit nayaa cheharaa hai
 An officer who has been watching him since 2003 says, "raje has never been as good at interacting and interacting with activists as she usually is, but even after working for 16 hours a day, she found herself mostly Limited to meetings related to implementation of policies and programs
 ''harek chunaav raily main raaje apni uplabdhiyaan ginaati hai or yojanaon ke kuch labhaarthiyon ko manch par pesh karti hai
 At the same time, the government is also organizing rallies, including the rally in Jaipur on 7 July which was addressed by Modi and enumerated successes like recruiting 40,000 teachers and promoting 6,000 constables
 party or sarkaar ne kisaanon, anusuchit jatiyon or anusuchit janajatiyon ke liye aisi kai or reliyon kii yojana banaai he, khaskar unke 50,000 rupye ke karje maaf kar dene ke baad
 Modi will also visit the state soon to conclude Raje's Gaurav Yatra focusing mainly on rural constituencies and will start the party's election campaign in urban areas as well
 rajya sarkaar ko or bhi kai muddon par jujhna pad rahaa he jisane raaje kii pareshaaniyon ko badhaayaa hi he
 These include the issue of conflict between upper castes and Dalits regarding amendment of SC / ST Atrocities Act, and also the issue of market downturn, for which traders are blaming Modi's economic policies
 congress in tamaam muddon ko apane chunaav abhiyaan main uthaa rahi he
 On the other hand, the BJP is chanting the 50-year-old Congress' Kuraj, which is rarely taken seriously by people because Pilot is a new face and other, 18 years out of the last 28 years BJP has been in power in Rajasthan
 congress or bhaajapa, donon se matadaataaon kaa mohabhang is tathy se jaahir hota he ki 2008 main nirdaleeyon or duusare ummidavaaron kii jholii main 15 fisadi vot gaye the or 2013 main "nota'' par pade vot 11 siton par jeet-haar ke antar se zyada the
 It also means that the Congress cannot believe that the anti-incumbent votes are bound to come in its bag
 yahi vajah he ki donon partiyaan jati samikarnon par zyada gaharaai se najar daal rahi hai
 The Congress has accused Raje of ignoring urban infrastructure, farmers and unemployed youth
 party rajputon ke ek hisse tak pahunchane kii koshish bhi kar rahi he, jinamein jaswant singh ke bete maanavendra singh bhi shaamil hai, jinhone haal main bhaajapa chhod di he
 On the other hand, the BJP High Command is working hard to not let the Rajput votes slip

 dilli main voting shuru hone ke kareeb 36 ghante pehle bijepi ke tamaam netaa or kaaryakartaaon ke saamne ab apane votaron ko matdaan ke liye baahar nikaalane kii chunauti he
 There is talk of a thorn contest in Delhi and in the last few days, the Aam Aadmi Party has captured its lost middle class voters
 tivi par aa rahe chunavi surveykshanon se bijepi thodaa ghabaraai hui he or aam aadmi party ke kaaryakarta isse utsahit dikh rahe hai
 During the talk on the tea cart, an Aam Aadmi Party worker in Gol Market said, ‚Äúour voter is not going to sit in the house
 
 
 ve saare garib log hai, jo mahangaai or bhrashtachar se chhutkaaraa chaahate hai
 
 
 Only those with money will vote for them (BJP), who do not get out easily to stand in line
 
 
 " i questioned, "you people's leaders are saying that the BJP is distributing money
" 
 
 ashutosh ne twit kiya he
 
 
 "he responded with a laugh," Mufflerman has explained it to everyone
 
 
 paise le lenge, lekin vot ve log hamen hi denge
 
 
 " is aadmi kaa ishaara arvind kejariwal ke us bayaan kii ore tha, jo unhone jansabhaon main diya or jiske liye unhen chunaav ayog se notice bhi mila he
 Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party's Volunteer is claiming to have a Spycam Army (an army with intelligence cameras)
 jangpura main ek aap kaaryakarta ne kaha, "ham kisi bhi tarah kii dhaandhlee ko rokane ke liye chaukanne hai
 
 
 " bijepi ne bhi aam aadmi party ke khatre ko bhaanp liya he or badi sankhya main apane kaaryakartaaon or aresas ke logon ko voting ke din sakriy rahane ko kaha he
 The hard work of these people is going to determine the strength and luck of the BJP
 bijepi ke adhyaksh amit shah or pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi is kathin ladaai ko samaj rahe hai
 The election of Delhi has become a question of Narendra Modi's nose
 kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu ne buudhvaar ko kah diya ki dilli chunaav ko narendra modi par refrendom (janamat) nahin samajha janaa chahie
 This statement is also being seen as a panic within the BJP
 bijepi ke netaaon ne pichley dinon 'sthir sarkaar' or 'chalem modi ke saath' jaise naare die hai or votaron se 'jhuthe vaadon se saavdhaan' rahane ko kaha he
 Prime Minister Modi has been seen in rallies in BJP advertisements saying that those who have expertise in dharna on the pavement, give them the same work, we have the expertise to run a good government, give us that work
 asal main yahi jumala bijepi ke paas he, jise vah votaron ko lubhaane ke liye istemaal kar rahi he or dilli kii sadakon par narendra modi ke chaahane vaale or samarthakon par iskaa asar bhi ho rahaa he
 36-year-old Hansraj in Connaught Place says, "try to force yourself as much as Kejriwal, but last time he left the government and ran away
 
 
 modi ji parformar hai
 
 
 The vote will be given to them only
 
 
 " That is, on one hand there is the image of Narendra Modi, which still appeals in the middle claus and on the other hand Kejriwal has anti-corruption slogan and poor common man, but where is the Congress standing in this fight
 congress ke liye in chunaavon main vaaki haal kharaab hai
 
 
 Rahul Gandhi is definitely in front of the people at the last moment, but his vote has been broken and gone towards Kejriwal
 buudhvaar ko rahul gandhi ne adivaasiyon or kamazor tabake kii tarafdaari karte hue jayanti natarajan kaa mudda uthaaya
 He said that he (rahul) had told Jayanti to take care of the poor and the tribals while passing the project
 rahul ne chunaav prachaar ke aakhri din bhi road sho kiya, jisamen acchhee bheed juty, lekin har chunaav main unka aadha-adhuraa utsaah voter ko juta nahin paata
 During the Lok Sabha elections, in the face of Modi and Kejriwal in Benares, Rahul also came to campaign on the last day, in which crowds had come, but his candidate could not get the votes
 dilli ke logon kii aam raay he ki rahul gandhi kii is apil kaa bhi turant asar nahin hoga
 "the Congress flag and rung are shaken
 
 
 abhi turant koi vot nahin dene vaala
 
 
 "says Biren, once a supporter of Congress, who is going to vote for the common man this time
 vah phir kehete hai, 'congress kaa nuksaan matlab, aam aadmi party kaa phayda, or jhaadu kaa nuksaan, matlab vot camel ko chalaa jayega
 
 
 " aaj dilli chunaav kii sachai yahi he
 
 
 The Congress vote is going to the broom
 bijepi ke saamne is badhat ko kaatane ke liye apane voter ko baahar nikaalane kii chunauti he
 Voter turnout on Saturday will be an important signal, be prepared

 The recent terrorist attack in Gurdaspur and the Udhampur incident had led to speculation that India might postpone the events of the upcoming meetings

 By the way, how can we change the picture? Has anything changed from empty talk? Those who should work properly, they are just talking
 ye he uttar pradesh main haivaaniyat kaa chehararep ke baad ladki kii jubaan kaat di
 The girl was burnt alive after the rape
 chaar saal kii bacchee ke saath haivaaniyat
 Even a year old girl is not safe
 kisi maasoom kii rape ke baad jubaan kaat lee jaati he, to kisi kii izzat taar-taar kar use jinda jalaayaa ja rahaa he
 So that those who can truly speak remain silent
 chup rahe taaki koi sun naa sake
 If a four-year-old girl is being raped somewhere, even the innocent one year is not safe in Akhilesh's Uttar Pradesh
 kareeb chaar maheene pehle hi akhilesh sarkaar ko lakhanu kii gaddi par kabiz hue ek saal puraa ho chukaa he
 Akhilesh took over the reins of the state on 15 March 2012
 pehla vaada yahi kiya tha ki rajya main jurm kii tasviir badal kar rakh denge
 The picture really changed, but instead of being good, it became worse
 unke rajya ke pehle saal main hi teen hajaar se zyada murder, hajaar ke kareeb rape, hajaar se zyada kidnaping or chaar hajaar se zyada lut ke maamle hue
 Akhilesh sir, whose secret is this in your UP? The public is suffering
 police laachaar or darindon kaa lagaataar atyaachaar bad rahaa he
 At least you do not know the secret
 lakhanu se lekar itawa, pratapgarh se lekar bulandshahr tak log behaal hai
 The incident is so frightening that the spirit trembles and you are just talking
 is maamle ko hi dekh len, pehle ladki ko 2 saal tak prem jaal main fansaaya gaya
 Then she is cheated by the lover in the room, there the lover and 3-4 of his friends respect the girl and then burn the girl alive
 ab ladki aspataal main marane kii kagaar par pahunch chuki he
 The spirit of anyone will be shaken after hearing this, but the surprise will increase further when you come to know that the girl was set on fire in Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's district Etawah
 saifai ke medical college ke bistar par padi peedit ladki 90 fisadi se bhi zyada jal chuki he
 The chance of getting life again is slim
 haalanki itawa jile ke ikdil ilaake ke desarmau gaanv ke 7 logon ke khilaaf maamla darj ho chukaa he, lekin sabhi aaropee faraar hai or koi giraptari nahin hui he
 The top police officers of the state are engaged in plundering the case, while the police department of the district is only registering the case and trying to get rid of the case
 tajjub hota he ye sochakar ki uttar pradesh ko uttam pradesh banane kaa daawa karne vaale mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke raaj main apradhi or balaatkaari bekhauf ho chuke hai jabaki police sust or laachaar
 It is painful to hear that statement even when the leader of Samajwadi Party, who is in power, says that such incidents also happen in other states of the country
 sattadhari party maamle ko rafadpha karne kii firaaq main he lekin virdohi partiyon ko sarkaar ko gherne kaa phir se mauka mila he
 According to statistics, understand the rising crime against women under Akhilesh's rule
 saal 2011 main puure uttar pradesh main mahilaon ke khilaaf 22639 aparaadh ke maamle darj kiye gaye, jabaki saal 2012 main ye aankada badhkar 23569 ho gaya yani 930 kaa ijapha
 In 2012, 1963 rape cases were reported in Uttar Pradesh
 jis pradesh main mahilaayein lagaataar asurakshit hoti ja rahi hai
 Will he ever be able to become a perfect state? Will the state ever develop in a state where there are more than 5 rapes on an average every day? Second story, first the girl's dignity, then the family who threatened to kill her life and finally the victim girl Try to kill himself
 kahani tivi ke kisi serial kaa nahin, yahi hakeekat he akhilesh yadav ke us uttar pradesh kii jahaan dabangon kii dabangai ek naaballig kii jindagi par baari pad rahi he
 The minor girl of Naubasta village of Jethwara police station in Pratapgarh district of Uttar Pradesh is repeatedly suffering the hardships of the domineering of the village
 philhal jila aspataal main bhartee he, jabaki us par kaatilaanaa hamalaa karne vaale 1 aaropee ko chhodkar sabhi faraar gum rahe hai
 In fact, the woman and her family allege that on January 22 this year, a young man from the village made her a victim of his lust
 police ne balaatkaar kaa maamla darj karke aaropee ko jail bhej diya
 In the same case, the victim minor was to record a statement before the magistrate in the court on 24 July
 lekin usase pehle ladki ke parivaar kii maane to buudhvaar kii der shaam jab peedit ladki ghar se baahar kahin ja rahi thi, usee vakt pehle se ghaat lagaae baithe rape ke aaropee yuvak ke bhai, rishtedaar or ek anya shaks ne ladki ko pakad liya or use ek sunsaan jagah par le gaye
 There, he made a dangerous attempt to bite his tongue with a sharp weapon and left him there in a bled state
 aspataal ke bistar par padi ladki kii jubaan par gahare jakhm ke nishaan koi kam dekhne vaala insaan bhi dekh saktaa he, lekin uttar pradesh police kii najar or niyat main shaayad khot he, tabhi use ye ek saamaanya chot dikh rahi he
 Like every time, the police's attempt to cover the case, is proving that the scale of his justice in the state is probably measured by weighing the social, political and economic status of the accused and the victim
 akhilesh yadav ke samaajawaadee party sarkaar ke kaarykaal main akele pratapgarh main hi balaatkaar ke kareeb dedh sau se adhik maamle saamne aa chuke hai, lekin silsilaa nahin tham rahaa
 Do not know when Akhilesh Yadav will make Uttar Pradesh the best state

 raat ke vakt aaropee ne bacchee ko apane saath sula liya or phir uske saath balaatkaar kiya
 When the girl's condition worsened after the rape, she was sent to the District Women's Hospital
 jahaan uskaa praathmik ilaaj karne ke baad use meerut ke sarkari aspataal main shift kar diya gaya
 At present, the police are engaged in their action after taking the accused into custody
 lekin udhar us maasoom kii haalat kaaphi gambhir bani hui he

 INS Virat, the world's oldest aircraft carrier, will retire on 6 March
 kareeb teen dashak tak isane bhartiya nausena ko apni sevaayen deen
 No decision has been taken yet about what will happen to Virat after retirement
 nausena kaa kahana he ki andhra pradesh sarkaar se baatcheet to chal rahi he kyonki kisi or ne isko lene main ruchi nahin dikhaai
 No one is willing to say anything about this, but it has been learned that if the Andhra government converts it into a museum, then it will cost around 1000 crores, but it is keen that the Ministry of Defense should bear half of the cost while sources in the Ministry of Defense Says that they are willing to provide technical help and advice
 ab antim faisla andhra sarkaar ko karnaa he
 By the way, due to being in service for the longest time, its name has already been recorded in the Guinness Book of Records
 tippaniyan Exactly according to his name - Virat weighs around 24 thousand tons
 yah 743 foot lanbaa he
 The width is 160 feet
 isaki raftaar kareeb 52 kilometre pratighanta he
 It was inducted into the Navy on 12 May 1987

 Along with this, seaking helicopters were also present
 is pot main kareeb 1500 nausenic rahete the or ek baar jab samandar se nikalataa tha to saath main teen maheene kaa rashan lekar nikalataa tha
 It covered the area of about two hundred kilometers, although the Navy neither directly participated in Kargil Jung nor Operation Vijay in Sri Lanka, but despite this, Virat played an important role during this time
 duniya ke sabase puraane vimaan vaahak pot viraat ne vishakhapatnam main pichley saal farvari main hue antarrashtriya flit rivyuu main hissaa liya tha
 This was his last operational deployment
 vahaan par yah sabake aakarshan kaa kendra tha
 In addition, the aircraft carrier participated in several international naval exercises such as Malabar exercises with the US Navy, Varun with the French Navy, Nasim Al Bahar with the Oman Navy
 is vimanavahak pot ne bitrain kii royal navy main 27 or bhartiya nausena main 29 saal bitaye hai
 Several combat aircraft have flown 22,034 from Virat's deck
 isane kareeb 2,250 din or kareeb 10,94,215 kilometre kaa safar samudr main tay kiya he
 This means that Virat spent more than six years in the sea, which can be circulated around 27 times in the world
 iskaa sidhaa matlab ye he ki viraat ne apane tees saal kii seva main chah saal samandar main rahaa or baaki bandargah par
 By the way, the Ministry of Defense had written a letter to the nine maritime states of the country long ago and said that if you want, you can take only one rupee token money to Virat
 yaa to aap ise museum banaaen yaa phir kuch aisa ki iskaa sammaan kaayam rahe, lekin andhrapradesh ko chhodkar kisi ne ise lene main ruchi nahin dikhaai
 Many who have worked in Virat are now feeling that it should not be like Vikrant aircraft carrier
 mumbai main nausena ne ienes vikrant ke liye 14 saal mumbai bandargah par intjaar kiya lekin koi ise lene nahi aayaa tab jaakar ise kabad main bech diya gaya
 Now the situation is that so far no state government nor private sector is ready to take on Virat

 It is 743 feet long
 chaudaai 160 foot he
 Its speed is about 52 kilometers per hour
 nausena main ise 12 may 1987 ko shaamil kiya gaya
 Sea harrier fighter aircraft were stationed in this vessel

 There were about 1500 naval vessels in this vessel and once it came out of the sea, it used to go with three months ration
 kareeb do sau kilometre ke ilaake main isaki tuuti bolti thi, haalanki nausena ne na to kargil jang or naa hi srilanka main oparation vijay main sidhe taur par hissaa liya tha lekin iske baavjood viraat ne is dauraan ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi

 viraat ke deck se kai ladaaku vimaanon ne 22,034 kii udaan bhari he
 It has traveled about 2,250 days and about 10,94,215 km at sea
 iskaa matlab yah he ki viraat ne samudr main chah saal se zyada samay guzaara jisamen duniya kaa kareeb 27 dfa chakkar lagaaya ja saktaa he
 This simply means that Virat spent six years in his thirty years of service in the sea and the rest at the port
 vaise raksha mantralay ne kaaphi pehle hi desh ke nau samudri rajyon ko chitthee likhakar kaha tha ki aap chahen to viraat ko maatr ek rupee kii token mani dekar le sakate hai

 viraat main kaam kar chuke kaiyon ko ab aisa laga rahaa he ki kahin iskaa bhi haal vikrant vimanavahak pot jaisaa naa ho
 In Mumbai, the Navy waited 14 years at the Mumbai port for INS Vikrant but no one came to pick it up and then it was sold to junk
 ab haalat ye he ki abhi tak naa koi rajya sarkaar or naa hi privet sector viraat ko lene ko taiyaar he
