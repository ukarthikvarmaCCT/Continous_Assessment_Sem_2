 loksabhaa chunaav main prachand bahumat ke saath pradhanmantri narendra (narendra Modi) ek baar phir paanch saal ke liye desh ke pradhanmantri pad par virajman hone ja rahe hai
 In this election, his party Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has got more than 303 (303) seats in the last Lok Sabha elections 2014 (282)
 is baar bhaajapa ke netritv main endie ne loksabhaa kii 542 siton main se 351 par jeet darj kii he
 After the victory, Prime Minister Modi addressed the NDA mps
 unke is sambodhan par rashtriya janata dal (RJD) ke netaa shivanand tiwari ne ek fasebuk post likhi he
 In his post, Tiwari said that after winning the last Lok Sabha election, when Narendra Bhai Modi was entering the Parliament House for the first time, he had set his frame on the door
 is martabaa unhone samvidhan kii kitaab par apana sar jhukaaya
 The Prime Minister said some good things while addressing the NDA mps yesterday (saturday)
 agar un par amal hota he to yah desh ke liye bahut shubh hoga
 In his address, he said that 'you must change yourself through speech, behavior and conduct
 ' duusari mahatvapurn baat jo baat unhone kahi, vah yah ki 'alpsankhyakon ke man main dar baitha kar unako alag-thalag kiya gaya he, unhen vot bank ke rup main istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 Everyone has to take that fear out of their minds and take it along
 'iske baad tiwari apni post main likhte hai, 'gandhi ji kehete the ki 'hamaare mastishk main asankhya niskriy vichaar ho sakate hai
 But they are like lifeless eggs
 unka koi mulya nahin hota
 But the same active thoughts come out from the bottom of the heart
 jo mulat: shuddh ho or praan kii sampurna shakti se purna ho to vah sakriy or gatisheel banakar itihaas kaa nirmaan kar saktaa he
 'tiwari writes,' The views expressed by Narendra Bhai Modi in his speech are active or passive! Lohia used the terms Saguna and Nirguna in lieu of them
 bhartiya raajnneeti main niskriy yaa nirgun baaten hi zyaada hoti hai
 If Prime Minister's speech of tomorrow is seen against the backdrop of his previous tenure, then he seems to be absent
 lekin jab jage tabhi savera
 What will be the test to test whether they are being given a virtuous form yesterday? The first criterion can be made by taking Pragya Thakur
 kyonki pragna thakur ne nathuram godse or mahatma gandhi ke sandarbh jo bayaan diya tha uske liye pradhanmantri ji ne 'ghrinaa' jaise kathor shabd kaa istemaal kiya tha
 He said that he was disgusted by that statement and that he would never forgive Pragya Thakur for this statement
 is bich chunaav jitkar pragna sansad main bhi aa chuki hai
 What will the Prime Minister do about them now? Will you be able to show your determination to separate Pragya Thakur from the party in order to make your point material? It can also be a criterion to check whether the speech of the Prime Minister was passive or absent or if he really wants to make it active or virtuous
 iske aage tiwari likhte hai, 'duusari kasuti alpsankhyako ke man se dar ko nikaalane ke sandarbh main banaai ja sakati he
 Fear is right
 dar kaa laabh uthaakar votbank ke rup main unka istemaal kiya jaataa he pradhanmantri ji ke is aarope main bhi dam he, lekin yah dar kin se he ! koun log unako daraa rahe hai! apane sambodhan main unhone yah spasht nahin kiya he
 i think the major reason for fear in the minds of minorities is due to the hatred being spread against them in the society
 koun failaa rahaa he nafrat? kya pradhanmantri ji ko yah batalaane kii zarurat he! had to yah he ki qabr se nikaalkar inaki mahilaon ke saath balaatkaar karenge, yahan tak kaha gaya he! kisne yah kaha he, pradhanmantri ji ko yah bhi bataane kii zarurat he kya? dafn ke liye teen gaj zamin chahie to vandemataram kahana hoga! pradhanmantri ji kii mantrimandal main shaamil ek sadsy aisa kehete hai
 Where does the courage to say this come from! This is because he feels that the Prime Minister prefers such language
 ve galat bhi nahin hai
 Speaking like this, he became a minister
 dange ke aaropee bhi mantrimandal main shaamil hai
 'at the end of his post, he wrote,' Therefore, he is really serious about what the Prime Minister has said in his speech yesterday and if he wants to give him active and virtuous form, then he can start it with two small steps
 pehla, pragna thakur ko apane dal se baahar nikaal kar or doosraa alpsankhyakon ke kilaaf zehar ugalane vaale sadasyon ko mantrimandal se baahar rakhkar
 These two small steps will give a big message and the Prime Minister will be able to move towards freeing the minorities from the vote bank

 vaise, hind mahaasaagar main oparate karne ke liye chini pandubbiyon ko malakka, lombok yaa sunda jaldmarumadhya se hokar janaa padegaa, jahaan samudr ke chhichley hone tathaa antarrashtriya niyamon ke chalate unhen yaa to sataha par rahanaa hoga, yaa kam se kam dikhte rahanaa padegaa
 The comments is vajah se bhartiya nausena sahit kshetreey nausenaon ko chini pandubbiyon ke phir gahare pani main ghota laga lene se pehle unki gatividhiyon par nigaraanee rakhane kaa mauka milegaa
 Indian naval officials told NDTV that the inclusion of us-built P8-I anti-submarine war jets benefited immensely, and played an important role in tracking Chinese submarines in the Indian Ocean
 puraane hote ja rahe soviet-nirmit tupolev tiu-142 kii jagah le rahe pi8-ai main atyaadhunik sensor lage hai, jinase pani ke bheetar pandubbi dwaara kii jane vaali awaz ko bhampa ja saktaa he
 When a submarine gets a clue, the P8-I can entangle the submarine with weapons, or with its datalink allow its naval ships and submarines, including allied ships and submarines in the same area, to locate the submarine's rightful place
 Can give information pichley ek dashak main pakistan ne apane sabase bade antarrashtriya saajheedaar china ke saath apane nausainik sambandh bhi majboot kiye hai
 In August last year, Pakistan State Radio announced a deal to acquire eight yuan class conventional diesel-powered submarines from China
 pehali chaar pandubbiyaan varsh 2023 ke ant tak deliver kiye jane kii ummid he, jabaki shesh chaaron pandubbiyaan karachi main hi varsh 2028 tak asembal kii jaaengi
 Perhaps the most important aspect is that China has access to Pakistan's strategically located Gwadar Port, which is part of the sino-pakistan Economic Corridor (china-pakistan Economic Corridor) at a cost of US $ 46 billion, and furthermore China itself has recently built a naval base at the Djibouti station in the Horn of Africa
 baharhaal, jo baat saaf he, vah he ki is samay hind mahaasaagar main pani ke neeche bilkul waisi hi chaalen chali ja rahi hai, jaisaa shityudh ke dinon main kiya jaataa tha
 By the way, to operate in the Indian Ocean, Chinese submarines would have to go through the Malacca, Lombok or Sunda Straits, where they would either have to remain on the surface, or at least be visible, due to the shallow sea and international regulations
 tippaniyan Because of this, regional navies, including the Indian Navy, will have the opportunity to monitor Chinese submarines before they dive deep again
 bhartiya nausenadhikariyon ne NDTV ko bataaya ki america-nirmit pi8-ai anti-sabamarine yudhak jet vimaanon ko shaamil karne se bahut phayda hua, or hind mahaasaagar main chini pandubbiyon par nazar rakhane main behad ahm bhoomika nibhaate hai
 The P8-i, which is replacing the aging Soviet-built Tupolev TU-142, has state-of-the-art sensors that can detect the sounds made by an underwater submarine
 jab kisi pandubbi kaa suraag mil jaataa he, to pi8-ai pandubbi ko hathiyaaron kii madad se ulajhaa saktaa he, yaa apane datalink kii madad se usee ilaake main maujuud mitra poton tathaa pandubbiyon samet apane nausainik poton-pandubbiyon ko us pandubbi kii sahi jagah kii soochna de saktaa he
 In the last decade, Pakistan has also strengthened its naval relations with its largest international partner, China
 pichley saal agast main pakistan state radio ne china se aath yuan class paramparaagat deazal-chaalit pandubbi hasil karne ke liye hue saude kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The first four submarines are expected to be delivered by the end of 2023, while the remaining four submarines will be assembled in Karachi by 2028
 shaayad sabase ahm pahalu yah he ki china ke paas pakistan ke ranneetik rup se gwadaar port tak pahunch he, jo 46 arab america dollar kii laagat se ban rahe china-pakistan aarthik galiyare (china-pakistan iconomic coridor) kaa hissaa he, or iske alaava china ne khud bhi horn of africa main jibooti stesan par haal hi main nausainik adda banaaya he

 While preparations were being made for the operation, at the request of Gandhiji, the head of 'servants of India Society' VS Srinivas Shastri and friend Dr
 fatak ko unke anurodh par bulaayaa gaya
 They jointly issued a public statement in which Gandhi said that he had given consent for the operation, he was well treated by doctors and there should be no anti-government protests if anything happens
 laal bahadur shastri ke 'jai jawan jai kisaan' ke naare ke peeche he ye kahani In fact, the hospital officials and Gandhi knew very well that if something went wrong in the operation, India would burn
 gandhi ne is par hastakshar ke liye jab kalam uthaai, to unhone karnal maddock se mazaakia andaaj main kaha, ‘‘dekho, mere haath kaise kaanp rahe hai
 
 
 You must do this correctly
 '' iske jawaab main maddock ne kaha ki vah puri takat laga lenge
 After this, chlorofoam was smelled to Gandhi
 jab oparation shuru kiya gaya, us samay aandhi or varsha ho rahi thi
 In the middle of the operation, the power went out and one of the three nurses in the operation theater caught a lantern, which underwent surgery
 gandhi ne safal oparation ke liye maddock ko dhanyavad diya
 The government had on February 5, 1924, waived Gandhi's remaining sentence

 BJP state unit president Dilip Ghosh claimed that even the deaths from dengue are being attributed to deaths due to fear of NRC
 ghosh ne haalanki kaha ki agar ve satta main aae to 'bangladeshi muslim ghuspaithiyon' se chhutkaaraa dilaane ke liye rajya main rashtriya naagarik panji (NRC) lagu karenge
 He told reporters here, 'we did not create any fear about NRC
 hamen jimmedaar tehraana anuchit he
 The BJP did not implement the NRC in Assam
 yah ucchtam nyaayalay ke adeshon ke anusaar kiya gaya
 On the other hand, West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamta Banerjee had on Monday accused the BJP of creating a fear of NRC, due to which six people have died in the state
 haalanki isse pehle pichley saptaah grahamantri amit shah se mulaakaat ke dauraan unhone kaha tha ki assam kii tarah pashchim bengal main NRC kii jarurat nahin he
 That meeting had drawn attention to the 19 lakh people, many of whom are 'genuine voters', whose names in Assam said that the citizens of Assam were not included in the register
 mamata banerjee ne amit shah ko bataaya ki pashchim bengal main assam jaise NRC kii zarurat nahin he
 Explain that the implementation of the civil register in Assam, out of which the names of 19 lakh people have been removed, faced severe criticism

 Under GST, the government can provide a major relief to taxpayers under the Composite Scheme

 The Group of Ministers, chaired by Assam Finance Minister Hemant Vishwasharma, has recommended tax relief, but the final decision will be taken at the GST Council meeting to be held on November 10
 biharke upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne bataaya ki baithak main compojit skim kii seemaa 1 karod se badha kar dedh karod karne ke saath hi compojit main shaamil menuphactures ko sakal bikri par 2 kii jagah 1 pratishat, restaurant ke liye 5 kii jagah 1 pratishat or treders ke liye 1 kii jagah 0
 a 5 percent tax payment has been suggested
 vahiin compounding dealer ko jo kar mukt maal kii bikri par koi tex nahin dete hai, unhen kar yukt maal kii bikri par 1 pratishat kar bhugtan kii anushansa kii gai he
 It is suggested to allow inter-state sales to the manufactures and traders involved in the compounding scheme

 But the impact of the economic recession has also faded the glow of this festival

 Ramlila is going to start in Delhi from 28 September
 ramlila cametiyon kaa kahana he ki kalakaar, manch or aayojan kaa kharch bad rahaa he
 The love-kush Ramlila Committee on the Red Fort Ground in Old Delhi is one of the oldest committees in the country
 lav kush ramlila cameti ke mahaamantri arjuna kumaar gupta kii maane to mandi ke kaaran vyapaaree ramlila cametiyon ko chanda dene main asamarth hai
 Arjun Kumar says that last year, where the Love Kush Ramlila Committee had made 5000 members, this time only 12 hundred members have been made
 iskaa asar chanda sangrah par pad rahaa he
 The committee says that traders are hesitant to give donations
 arjuna kumaar ne bataaya ki har saal ram baraat shobhaayatra nikali jaati he jisusmen 50 jhaankiyaan hoti hai, abaki baar shobhaa yatra main 25 jhankiyaan hi hongi
 Apart from this, new dress has not been purchased for the actors who play the character of Ram, Ravana and Sita
 ye kalakaar puraani dress se hi kaam chalaayenge
 Fireworks expenses have also been reduced
 jo cametiyaan pehle aatankwaad ke khilaaf putala dahan karti thim ve is baar manhagaai kaa putala foonkane kii baat kar rahi hai
 Suresh Bindal, who has organized the Indraprastha Ramlila Committee for the last 26 years, says that when the businessmen who run the economy do not have money, then what will they pay? Ramlila committees say that even though the donations are getting less, the expenses are not reduced, due to which the accumulated capital has to be withdrawn

 The grandeur of Ramlila has been reduced so that expenses can be reduced
 is baar hanuman kaa helicopter se sanjivani booti lekar aana yaa badi badi trainon ke jariye ravan dwaara sita kaa haran karnaa yah sab is baar ramlila main hitech tareeke se najar nahin aayega
 Iqbal, who has created an effigy of Ravana in Ramlila for the last several years, said that inflation has increased but the cost of his work has not increased

 After seeing the report of the Brussels terrorist attack on CNN, i stayed for a while
 jaise hi brake aayaa ek sisitivi company kaa vigyaapan aane laga
 i do not have authorized information that this advertisement of CCTV camera was already coming or has started coming after the attack
 agar yah sanyog he tab bhi or agar hamale ke baad vigyaapan aane laga he, tab to or bhi hamen jaananaa chahie ki aatankwaad ko rokane main sisitivi kii kya bhoomika he
 i neither specialize in CCTV footage nor terrorist attacks
 phir bhi sawaal karne main harz hi kya he ki sisitivi camera hamale ke baad saboot jutaney ke liye hota he yaa aatanki hamalon ko rokane ke liye
 What special evidence we collect from these cameras, which helps us in preventing further attacks
 ham roak pate bhi hai yaa sirf isi baat se santusht ho jate hai ki hamalwaara kaisaa dikhataa tha or koun tha
 You must have seen these days after any terrorist attack CCTV footage starts playing on thousands of news channels
 ghatana sthal par chizein bikhrin huin hai or log badahavaas bhaage ja rahe hai
 In a while, the picture of the attacker also comes and his huliya starts running on the channels around the world
 naam tak aa jaataa he ki koun he or kahaan kahaan se yahaan aayaa he
 All these important information are there and a lot is known through them, but even after this, the next attack is done
 ab jo marane aayaa ho wo apane baad ke sabooton ke liye sisitivi kii chintaa bhala kyon karegaa
 Only a security expert can tell with enough examples what we are getting from CCTV camera footage
 durghatana or anya maamalon main ho saktaa he ki yah phydemand ho, lekin aatankwaad ko rokane main kitna kargar he jaananaa dilachasp rahegaa
 If you google, the names of all the companies and distributors who make and sell CCTV come up
 inkaa kul kaarobaar bhi hazaron karod rupee kaa hoga hi
 It is to be seen whether the CCTV camera business grows after the terrorist attack
 ab to log apane gharon or dukaanon main choron se bachane ke liye sisitivi laga lete hai
 The government and the public are spending money on this fiercely and we are paying tax that the government will protect us through police
 tex bhi de rahe hai or sisitivi bhi laga rahe hai
 Is CCTV a Soldier Alternative? Has CCTV Camera Helped in Preventing Terrorism? Has CCTV camera helped prevent theft and other incidents
 aae din ham khabaren padhate rahete hai ki sisitivi camera laga hone ke baad bhi chor atm mashin hi le bhaage
 Some thieves are caught, but the theft is still happening
 sone chaandi kii dukaan se bhi chori hoti rahati he or channelon ko chalaane ke liye footage mil jaataa he
 Maybe on the basis of this, the thief would later be caught, but we know as statistics or all our information can be based on statistics

 When all the powerful countries of the world declare that they are fighting terrorism then what is the result of this fight
 kabhi maidan iraq hota he, to kabhi siria ho jaataa he
 The terrorists choose their place and attack them comfortably
 to kya aatankwaad se ladane ke naam par sirf bayaan hi die gaye yaa kuch hua bhi
 Nothing concrete seems to happen in the context of these events

 The Times of India news of May 15, 2015 shows that the bjp-shiv Sena government has decided that more than 6600 CCTV cameras will be installed in Mumbai by September 2016
 iske liye kareeb saadhe nau so karod kaa karcha aayega
 After the terrorist attacks and the Nirbhaya incident in Delhi too, a lot of confidence was raised on the CCTV camera
 17 janvari 2015 kii india today kii khabar ke anusaar, dilli hoicourt ne centre or dilli sarkaar kii khinchaai kii he ki aapane baraak obama ke liye dilli shahar main 15000 sisitivi laga die, lekin nagarikon ke liye nahin
 Now imagine if 15000 CCTV cameras can be installed in Delhi within a few weeks for Obama's arrival, why does it take five years to install more than 6600 CCTV cameras after the 26 November 2011 attack
 iskaa matlab he ki sarkarein chahen to hafte bhar ke bheetar saare camere laga sakati hai
 By the way, how much would it cost to install 15,000 CCTV cameras? times of india kii 20 may 2015 kii khabar he ki dilli police ne adaalat se kaha ki 44 gambhir aparaadh kshetron main vah 6 hazaar se adhik camera lagaana chaahati he, jiskaa kharchaa 400 karod se adhik aayega
 The court refused, stating that she could not give permission, as she sees the intention of earning in this budget
 ab aap dekhiye
 Mumbai also has more than 6000 CCTV cameras, but the budget there is 949 crores
 dilli main bhi 6000 se adhik sisitivi camere lagane kii baat hoti he or vahaan kaa bajet he 400 karod
 Mumbai's budget doubled! i am writing all these on the basis of newspaper reports
 vaise yah bhi jaananaa chahie ki har rajya main sisitivi kaa bajet kya he or prati camera laagat kya he
 It is obvious that in the name of fighting terrorism, more money is generated in the name of cameras than on cameras
 tippaniyan a news report on Mail Online India on 25 May 2013 may give us a slight idea of the cost per camera
 khabar ke anusaar soochna ke adhikaar kaaryakarta harpal singh rana ko dilli police ne jaankaree di he ki 1337 sisitivi camere lagaae hai, jin par 68 karod kii laagat ai he
 New Delhi Municipal Corporation has reported that it has installed 53 cameras in its area, which has cost Rs 1 crore 2 lakh, that is, 2 lakh 30 thousand has been spent on one camera

 The court refused, stating that she could not give permission, as she sees the intention of earning in this budget
 ab aap dekhiye
 Mumbai also has more than 6000 CCTV cameras, but the budget there is 949 crores
 dilli main bhi 6000 se adhik sisitivi camere lagane kii baat hoti he or vahaan kaa bajet he 400 karod
 Mumbai's budget doubled! i am writing all these on the basis of newspaper reports
 vaise yah bhi jaananaa chahie ki har rajya main sisitivi kaa bajet kya he or prati camera laagat kya he
 It is obvious that in the name of fighting terrorism, more money is generated in the name of cameras than on cameras
 tippaniyan a news report on Mail Online India on 25 May 2013 may give us a slight idea of the cost per camera
 khabar ke anusaar soochna ke adhikaar kaaryakarta harpal singh rana ko dilli police ne jaankaree di he ki 1337 sisitivi camere lagaae hai, jin par 68 karod kii laagat ai he
 New Delhi Municipal Corporation has reported that it has installed 53 cameras in its area, which has cost Rs 1 crore 2 lakh, that is, 2 lakh 30 thousand has been spent on one camera
 agar aap saavdhaanee se guna bhaag karenge to alag-alag vibhaagon ke sisitivi lagane ke anumaan main antar saaf dikh jayega
 The CCTV camera is an important device and does not want to be fooled to deny its role, but it would not be foolish to question its success and cost
 aatankwaad se sisitivi udyog ko phayda ho rahaa he yaa sisitivi se aatankwaad ruk rahaa he? is sawaal par agar thos jawaab mil jaae to kya koi nuksaan ho jayega
 The Times of India reported on 20 May 2015 that the Delhi Police told the court that it wanted to install more than 6 thousand cameras in 44 serious crime areas, which would cost more than 400 crores
 adaalat ne yah kahkar inkaar kar diya ki vah anumati nahin de sakati, kyonki unhen is bajet main kamai kii manshaa nazar aati he
 Now you see
 mumbai main bhi 6000 se adhik sisitivi camere lagane hai, lekin vahaan kaa bajet he 949 karod
 There is also talk of installing more than 6000 CCTV cameras in Delhi and there is a budget of 400 crores
 mumbai kaa bajet dugana! ye sab main akhbaaron kii report ke aadhaar par likh rahaa hum
 By the way, one should also know what is the budget of CCTV in every state and the cost per camera
 zaahir he aatankwaad se ladane ke naam par camaron se zyaada camaron ke naam par hone vaali kamai kii zyaada chintaa kii jaati he
 The comments mail online india par 25 may 2013 ko chhapi ek khabar se hamen prati camere laagat kaa thodaa sa andaaza ho saktaa he
 According to the news, Delhi Police has informed the right to information activist Harpal Singh Rana that 1337 CCTV cameras have been installed, which cost 68 crores
 nai dilli municipal corporation ne soochna di he ki usne apane kshetra main 53 camere lagaae hai jin par ek karod 2 lakh kaa kharchaa aayaa he, yani ek camere par 2 lakh 30 hazaar kaa kharch aayaa he
 If you carefully multiply the division, then the difference in the estimate of installing CCTV of different departments will be visible
 sisitivi camera ek mahatvapurn upkaran to he or isaki bhoomika ko nakaarne kii bevakoofi nahin karnaa chahta, lekin isaki kamyaabi or laagat ko lekar sawaal karnaa bevakoofi nahin hogi
 Is CCTV industry benefiting from terrorism or is CCTV stopping terrorism? If there is a solid answer to this question, will there be any loss
 ab aap dekhiye
 Mumbai also has more than 6000 CCTV cameras, but the budget there is 949 crores
 dilli main bhi 6000 se adhik sisitivi camere lagane kii baat hoti he or vahaan kaa bajet he 400 karod

 ye film purv piem ke media salaahkaar rahe sanjay baru kii kitaab par aadhaarit he
 However Dakshin Chara, a filmmaker and theater activist from Ahmedabad, has been angry with the censor board ever since the trailer of this film came out

 charaa ne daawa kiya ki film accidental prime ministar main saaf taur par rajanetaaon, raajnneetik partiyon or partiyon ke jhandon ko dikhaaya gaya he, lekin unki film main istemaal chote political reference ko bhi hataane ke liye kaha gaya tha
 According to him, "they have no problem with Anupam Kher and Akshaye Khanna's film, but they want to know from CBFC why many scenes of their film, which came out last year, were scissored?" Significantly, the film 'sameer' The Examining Committee of the Censor Board reviewed on 28 February 2017
 film dekhne ke baad screening cameti ne film main kai kats lagane kaa faisla kiya tha
 Dakshin said that the committee said that the bjp's flag shot and the words 'al Jazeera' should be removed from the film
 iske alaava film main ek dialog ke dauraan 'man kii baat' kaa prayog hua tha, use bhi hataane ke liye kaha gaya tha
 The board said that this is the name of the radio show of PM and it cannot be used
 yahi nahi film main ek dialog 'dilli kaa rasta upi se hokar jaataa he' ko bhi cat karne ke liye kaha gaya tha kyonki is dialog main political andertone tha
 Apart from this, the committee also asked for the removal of several violent scenes

 " unhone kaha- film main unhen apana kirdaar behad pasand aayaa
 He never played such a role before
 ye alag tarah se likhaa gaya tha
 For these 3 reasons, the Accidental Prime Minister must be told that by watching the trailer of the Accidental Prime Minister, people are still in dilemma as to who is the hero in the movie and who is the villain? In his book, Sanjay Baru also put Sonia Gandhi in the dock
 logon kaa kahana he movie kii aad main congress kii saakh ko dhwast karne kii koshish he
 The big question is whether the Congress and the Gandhi family are shown as villains in the film? Are Manmohan Singh and Sanjay Baru shown as heroes? Only after the release of the film will these questions be answered

 The woman's body has been recovered from her house

 This sensational incident of murder is in Mirzapur Nagar Kotwali police station area

 The body of a woman living in the city's most posh area was recovered from her room on Wednesday

 He immediately reported the incident to the police
 police ne maukey par jaakar dekha to kamare ke farsh par minaa kii laash padi thi
 On seeing the corpse, it seemed that Meena has been strangled with a cloth in her mouth
 police ko chaanbin main pataa chalaa ki ghar main koi lut paat bhi nahin hui he
 That is why the police is anticipating the woman's involvement in this case of murder
 police ko is maamle main hatya kii vajah sampatti vivaad lag rahaa he
 Because for the last 20 years, the woman was working to buy and sell property in the city
 is silsile main kai logon se uskaa vivaad bhi ho chukaa he
 The police is currently investigating this case
 sabhi dharmon or jatiyon ke aarthik rup se kamazor tabake logon ko 10 pratishat aarakshan ko lekar sansadeey raajnneeti main koi khaas virodh nahin hua
 Now come on those aspects of protest which are happening in some part of the country every day, but no party comes forward for them
 sabhi prakaar kii sarkaron se aaj tak ye na hua ki ek paardarshee or eemaandaar pariksha vyavastha de saken jis par sabakaa bharosa ho
 Leaving a solution to the basic problem, all the time, looking for a big and easy issue has broken millions of youth
 aasaan isliye kaha ki aarakshan ko lekar loksabhaa yaa rajya sabha main kuch khaas virodh nahin hua
 It is a good thing that the opponents of reservation have got reservation, but when the system will be fine for getting the benefit of reservation
 yah sawaal kyon nahin pramukh ban sakaa ki naukari main bahaali kii prakiya bhrasht kyon he
 When will it be alright 20 march 2017 ko eidiemke ke saansad elumalai velligunder ne prakaash jaavdekar se sawaal kiya tha ki central uniwarsity main chaatr or shikshakon ke anupaat ko behatar karne ke liye kya kadam uthaae ja rahe hai, khaali padon ko bharne ke liye kya kiye ja rahe hai
 In response, the Minister of Human Resources had said that this is a continuous policy
 ham ek saal ke bheetar dilli vishvidhyalay main padhaa rahe sabhi 9000 edock shikshakon ko permanent kar denge
 It also said that we have solved this problem
 prakaash jaavdekar hi bataa sakate hai ki saare 9000 pad bhare gaye hai yaa nahin
 If filled, the guest teacher and adhoc teacher would not picket
 inke liye dharna dena bhi aasaan nahin he
 Salary is deducted
 principal dhamka dete hai naukari kaa dar dikhaakar
 Even then, after taking their class, they are joining this dharna
 prakaash jhaavdekar ne saaf saaf kaha tha ki ki part time rojgaar kendiy vishvavidhyalayon kii niti nahin hai
 March 2017 statement
 ab aapako 11 aktubar 2017 kaa bayaan dikhaat hai jo hamaare channel par chalaa tha
 Even after 6 months have passed, the Minister is saying the same thing that 9000 posts will be filled
 6 maheene baad bhi prakaash jhaavdekar ek saal kii baat kar rahe hai
 In March 2017, Prakash Jhavadekar also said that within a year there was also talk of filling ten thousand vacancies in the central schools, which i am not updated about whether those ten thousand posts were filled within a year
 prakaash jhaavdekar ne us vakt sirf dilli vishvavidhyalay kii hi baat nahin kahi thi balki kaha tha ki sabhi central uniwarsity main khaali pad permanent kar die jaaenge
 Central University had 20 percent vacancies
 pratishat main yah sankhya choti lagati he lekin jab hazaar main dekhenge to kai hazaar ho jaaegi
 The minister said that they will be reviewed every 15 days and information will be given on the website
 aisi koi jaankaree ujisi kii website par nahin milti he

 Verification of all this has also been done but no posting has been done
 sochie kya hota he kalejon main shikshak nahin hai
 So your children will be ruined
 ab phir se lautate hai dilli
 March 2017 to January 2019
 permanent naukari kaa pataa nahin
 Despite the support of many political parties, all teacher organizations, their problem is not solved
 inaki maang he ki 10 saal 15 saal se padhaane vaale edaha shikshakon ko permanent karne ke liye ek adhyadesh laayaa jaae
 Because they have been teaching for ten years, fulfilling the eligibility conditions
 yahi nahin har chaar maheene main vishvavidlaay in edock shikshakon ko certificate detaa he ki aapaki seva santoshjanak he
 Teachers who have been teaching for ten years have already accumulated 30 certificates from colleges and universities that you teach well
 isliye aapaki sevaaon kaa vistaar kiya jaataa he
 On March 5, 2018, the UGC took out a circular that the college would not be considered as a unit, would consider the department as a unit and form a roster i
e
 set the service and needs of teachers
 is niti ke kaaran hazaron edock shikshak sadak par aa jate, isse anusuchit jati or janajati ke shikshakon kaa sanvaidhanik adhikaar bhi chhin jaataa
 So there are generals among these teachers, who are scheduled castes, tribes, Christians and Muslims are Sikhs for whom the government is working so hard to bring reservation
 bahaali main bhi mehnat hogi tabhi to aarakshan kaa laabh milegaa
 When the circular of the UGC was opposed, on 19 July 2018, jobs were stopped in universities across the country
 sarkaar ne kaha ki ham adhyadesh laaenge
 Ordinance did not come for 8 to 9 months
 bharat kii ek badi uniwarsity kaa ye haal he
 Our colleague Saurav Shukla has spoken to all these teachers
 maukey par jaakar reporting kii he
 You will be surprised that women teachers have been teaching for many years but they do not get the benefit of maternity leave in this Delhi
 dilli vishvavidlaay main kareeb 2000 padon ke liye 3 lakh 80 hazaar ne farm bhare
 Vacancy was expected to be 4500 but i was 2000
 shikshakon ke farm bharne or dastavezon ke photo kapi karaane main 700-800 rupee kharch ho gaye
 That too of a college
 kai kalejon ke liye bharne par ek shikshak ke kai kai hazaar rupee kharch ho gaye
 University and college got 15-20 crores from his pocket
 15-16 maheene ho gaye magar bahaali kaa pataa nahin he
 In a few days these farms will be lost and money wasted
 2007 se lekar ab tak kai baar farm niklaa he
 The fee is filled in and the form lapse
 dilli hai court ne order kiya tha ki 31 july 2017 tak 4500 pad bhar die jaaen
 But the advertisement turned out to be 2000 posts
 usamen se bhi do saal main teen post bhare jate hai
 This is the condition of Delhi University
 edaha shikshakon ne bataaya ki teen vibhaagon main intervyuu hua to 18 saal se padhaa rahe shikshak ko baahar kar diya gaya

 In many states including Delhi, how are the youth upset with the examination system

 Police has also announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh in this case

 They should get the right to investigate this
 tamaam parikshaon main dobaaraa checking kaa praavdhaan hota he to is pariksha main kyon nahin he
 Students say that CBSI also offers re-checking
 jab bhi soochna ke adhikaar se paper nikalvaaya he, paaya gaya he ki sahi jawaab dene ke baad bhi galat number die gaye hai
 In such a situation, the option of re-checking should be available
 agali pariksha 6 maheene hogi
 If there is a problem in that examination also, will they have to wait for 6 months again, is it not good to have the facility of re-checking so that the students can save their time

 foundation kaa course 9 maheene kaa hota he
 It consists of four papers
 9 maheene ke baad pariksha hoti he jise paas karne ke baad hi intermediat main jane ke liye yogya hote hai
 Intermediate studies are held for one and a half years in which 8 papers are taught
 uske baad hoti he pariksha, lekin bahut kam hi ek baar main paas ho pate hai
 They fail in some paper
 bahut se chaatr chah se saat baar tak pariksha dete rahete hai taaki intermediat main paas ho saken
 Two to three years pass in it
 uske baad teen saal kii internship hoti he or phir final ke 8 paper dene hote hai
 In this also no one passes
 kai chaatro se baat karne par pataa chalaa ki jaanboojhkar fail karne kii niti apanaai jaati he
 Of course, some students do not study, but it is not right to fail everyone continuously under their guise
 padhai main hi puri umr biit jaati he
 If many students are not able to pass even in 7 years, then they leave their middle school and start working for 10 to 15 thousand jobs in a small business
 unka saat saal barbaad ho jaataa he
 Some students have appeared for 10 exams but have not passed

 72
 86 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye
 This is the type of examination in which 73 percent of the students fail
 kya yah kisi sanstha ke liye gaurav kii baat ho sakati he
 Therefore, the matter of CA students should be considered and the need to improve the system of examination from its studies should be understood
 fail hone kaa bijness bhi he
 icai is a law making body of parliament

 Stating that the 'quota within quota' is completely unacceptable in the Women's Reservation Bill, the BJP today said that it is ready to support any proposal in which the responsibility of giving 33 percent tickets to women should be put on political parties

 He said that the government's stand is that it will find a solution to this problem through discussion and discussion and the BJP wants to see it become a reality

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator Varun Dhawan's film 'badrinath Ki Dulhania' is earning well at the box office
 haal hi main varun dhawan ne hamase baat kii
 Varun Dhawan answered some questions related to the film and his life
 
 
 1
 What was your reaction to 'badrinath'? When i was shooting for Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania, i knew that i had to do another film with Shashank Khaitan
 shashaank kaaphi positive hai or wo logon ko tarashte hai
 Alia also wanted to work with him
 100 karod ke club main shaamil hui 'badrinaath kii dulhaniya'!2
 Your math is weak? That Shashank has written a joke on me
 unhone mujhase ganit ke bare main poocha bhi tha or vahi film main rakhaa
 Anyway, lovers are weak in maths because there is no calculus in love
 'badri kii dulhaniya' kaa nayaa song, 'humsafar' bane varun-aalia3
 Is there a rift between your family and Govinda? i have met Govinda many times
 unhone mujhe bahut aashirwad bhi diya he
 i feel that if everything is to be fixed, then Papa and Govinda should get it all right
 main sahi karne kii jagah par nahin hum
 Who is right in both and who is wrong, i cannot tell this, but both of them should sit together and solve everything
 natasha ke saath thailand main chhuttiyaan bitaa rahe hai varun dhawan4
 Are you doing 'judwaa 2' with Dad? My dad always wanted to make a double role film with me
 dead ne jitani dabl role vaali filmein banaai hai, shaayad hi or kisi ne banaai ho
 He believes that the real strength of the actor is known only in such a role
 kyonki actor ko ek saath do tarah ke role nibhaane hote hai
 Sajid sir also had to make 'judwaa 2', so all things came together
 5
 Do you like doing all kinds of movies? Yes, because i don't want the same type of roll tag and i get a challenge to do different kinds of characters
 isiilie koshish rahati he alag-alag filmein karne kii
 6
 'judawaan' main aapaki salmaan se tulana bhi kii jaaegi?ham 'judawaan' ko ricriet nahin kar rahe
 Filming in a different way
 kuch aisi janareshan bhi he jinhone 'judawaan' nahin dekhi he
 Our effort is to make 'twin 2' quite different
 7
 How will your bride be? Varun's bride will be good, who will not persecute Varun
 lekin usamen kaaphi time he abhi
 8
 staradam ko kaise dekhte hai?log jab mere kirdaaron ko pasand karte hai, to mujhe zyada acha lagata he
 See when the film is released, then it becomes very lonely for an actor, very sad
 lekin uske baad agali film ho, to acha hota he
 9
 aalia ke saath aapni jodi ko aap shahrukh-kaajol kii jodi jaisi maanate hai?nahin nahin, wo kaaphi bade hai
 Mary and Alia's pair are today's pair of alia-varun
 ye har umr ke logon ko pasand aani chahie
 10
 twitor ke trend or trol par kya kahana hai?main kabhi bhi soch samaj ke nahin likhata, mere ghar vaale or parivaar vaale hameshaa mujhe is baat ke liye sunaate hai
 Recently i had also tweeted a tweet about how much has changed in the post-1984 generation
 technology bad gai he, lekin is life main balance hona chahie
 When alcohol or drugs are drunk, there is a chemical release in our brain which increases our tendency towards alcohol or drugs
 vaisaa hi soshal network par hota he, agali post par pichhali se kam likes aate hai to insaan depressant main chalaa jaataa he jo ki hamaare liye kaaphi aswasth kar dene vaali baat he
 It has been a different world
 ye mere saath bhi hota he, main bhi kabhi-kabhi ye sab dekhakar lo feel karata hum
 11
 kisi baat kaa dar lagata he?abhi haal philhal to nahin lekin haa gharavaalon ke badhati umr se dar lagata he
 i am afraid of losing those close to me
 12
 Karan Johar's book is also very special
 kya aap unka kirdaar nibhaana chahenge?karan ek aakarshak kerector hai
 By the way, the character of Badrinath is also no less than a biopic because Shashank has written this character only on his acquaintance
 jab aap film dekhenge to aapako lagegaa kii aapane aise insaan ko kahin naa kahin dekha he
 13
 iske baad koun si filmein kar rahe hai?'judwa 2' or ek shoojit sarkaar kii film he, jiske bare main baad main bataaungaa

 Gangnihar Badani Devi of Bikaner has 4 sons and 1 daughter
 unhone july main apana nirnay parivaar ke saamne rakhaa tha
 Family members say that they forbade Badni Devi but she did not listen, after a few days they stopped taking medicines
 ab unhone 46 dinon se bhojan pani tyaag rakhaa he, din main sirf kuch chamach pani piti hai
 Santhara is the practice in Jainism where a person renounces water and attains death

 atakalein hai ki agle 24 ghante main nitish kumaar bhrashtachar ke aaropon main ghire apane dipti siem tejasvi yadav ke khilaaf koi bada faisla le sakate hai
 If this happens, the Grand Alliance will also be under threat
 haalanki raajnneetik halaat par najar rakhe vishleshak maanate hai ki tejasvi kii kursi jane par bhi mahagathabandhan bachaa rahegaa kyonki ye ladaai raajnneetik samikarnon main badlaav kii nahin balki mahaj image or ahm kii he
 Tejashwi is scheduled to leave the Nitish cabinet after the cbi's name in the scam case
 kyonki nitish kii party jediu lagaataar kah rahi he ki wo karpshan ke maamle main koi samjhauta nahin karegi
 That is, the case is of Nitish's image, who despite being the Chief Minister for the last two decades, has no allegation of corruption
 ab sawaal sirf ye he ki tejasvi khud istipha denge yaa phir nitish unhen barkhaast karenge
 If Nitish is worried about his image, then the question is also important for Lalu
 argedy kaa tark he ki sankhyabal main zyada hone ke baavjood nitish yaa jediu uske saath gairon jaisaa bartaav nahin kar sakate
 RJD knows that his compulsion to save the Grand Alliance is as much as that of Nitish and JDU, so Nitish should take the initiative to save it and talk to Lalu and find a middle ground
 party netaa ab khulkar kehane lage hai ki nitish ko lalu se baat kerani chahie
 What will happen is the middle path is so clear that Nitish does not want to see Tejashwi in the government at any cost
 unhen hataane par mahagathbandhan tut jaae or phir se bijepi kii madad se sarkaar chalaani pade nitish aisa bhi nahin chahenge
 This is the reason why the middle path is being talked about
 ek vikalp ye he ki tejasvi ko istipha dene ko kaha jaae or lalu apane parivaar se kisi anya ko dipti siem banavaa den
 The name of Lalu's daughter Rohini Yadav is also being discussed in this episode
 kya he lalu kaa plan-binithish ke saath gathjod kar siyaasi vaapasi karne vaale lalu kaa rukh sakht bhale hi dikh rahaa ho lekin kisi bhi surat main ve mahagathbandhan ko tuutate dekhnaa nahin chahenge
 To keep the pressure on the government after Tejashwi's resignation, all the RJD ministers may resign from the Nitish cabinet but the Nitish government will continue to be supported from outside
 bijepi nitish sarkaar ko samarthan kaa elaan kar chuki he aise main lalu nitish ko bijepi kheme main jane se rokane ke liye baahar se samarthan vaala kadam uthaa sakate hai
 For these 5 reasons, Nitish will not go along with BJP, BJP is praising Nitish Kumar and declaring support for separation from Lalu but the chances of Nitish going into BJP camp are slim
 ye hai 5 kaaran-1
 Image 2 of Modi's staunch opponent

 Good future prospects in opposition against Modi4
 vipaksh ke sabase bharosemand chehre5
 In the event of a third front, Nitish can join hands, however, Nitish can also play a long bet by going with BJP
 bijepi ke votbank or apane chehre kii badaulat nitish bihar main ek lambii siyaasi pari khel sakate hai

 As Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal sits in front of Mahatma Gandhi's tomb and pray at Rajghat and remains silent on corruption, the Delhi BJP has asked Kejriwal to say 'what is this relationship'

 Most people are happy with the functioning of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Sarkar in Aaj tak-karvy's survey 'desire of the country'
 yahi vajah he ki desh ke sarvshereshth mukhyamantriyon kii list main unka kad lagaataar ooncha hota ja rahaa he or ve top-5 main jagah banane main kaamyaab hue hai
 Yogi's popularity has seen an increase of 10 per cent in the last one and a half years
 yah survey 2478 logon par kiya gaya he jisamen 20 loksabhaa kshetra shaamil kiye gaye
 This exclusive survey was conducted from 28 December to 8 January
 agast 2017 main upi ke 30 fisadi votaron kii raay main yogi adityanath sarvshereshth mukhyamantri the lekin janvari aate-aate is aankade main giravat aa gai or 28 fisadi logon ne hi yogi ko best siem mana
 After this, in August 2018, Yogi's popularity increased by almost 33 per cent and the figure of 28 per cent increased to 42 per cent
 lokapriyata main ai ye oochaal haalanki thodi giri he or is saal janvari main survey main 40 fisadi logon ko lagata he ki yogi adityanath sarvshereshth mukhyamantri hai
 With 40 per cent of the votes, Yogi has joined the top five popular chief ministers of the country

 Let me tell you, the film is going to be shot in Ooty, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Goa

 On completion of four years of the Modi government's tenure, on the platform of Panchayat Aaj Tak, Union Energy Minister RK Singh said that as soon as the people of the country came to know the truth of the secularism of the Congress, it showed the way to the opposition
 aarake singh ne yah bayaan dete hue kaha ki congress ne satta main rahete hue secularism ke naam par tushtikaran kii nitiyon ko aage badhaane kaa kaam kiya
 On RK Singh's claims, the Congress leader said that the Modi government needs to be vigilant along with enthusiasm
 tiwari ke mutabik modi sarkaar ahankaar kaa jeeta jaagta udhaaharan he
 Tiwari said that the BJP government has failed on all parameters
 modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal main dharmik sauhaard kii sthiti nimnatam str par he
 The Modi government promised crores of jobs but has proved to be completely hollow
 manish tiwari ne kaha ki narendra modi ne 2014 ke chunaavon main vaada kiya ki vah apane kaarykaal ke dauraan karodon naukariyaan lekar aaenge
 According to this promise, by now the Modi government should have created 8 crore jobs
 lekinrozegarpaida karnaa bijepi kii praathamikta nahin he or vah sirf dharm ke aadhaar par dhruvikaran karte hue phayda uthaanaa chaahati he
 However, on the issue of polarization, RK Singh said that by 2014 the people of the country understood that the Congress was working to appease only a particular community
 yadicongresssirf secular rahete to congress kii ye naubat nahin aati
 At the same time, the Congress accuses the BJP of being communal
 lekin hamaare pradhanmantri jab ajaan kii aawaaj sunate hai to apana bhaashan roak lete hai
 RK Singh claimed that this dual character of the Congress has been understood by the nation, which is why the voters of the country have uprooted it and put it in opposition
 iske alaava kendriya mantri ne daawa kiya ki modi sarkaar ne urja ke kshetra main van nesan van grid kii badi uplabdhi hasil kii he
 At the same time, renewable energy capacity has doubled in just four years

 Unaware of the incident of saving Praveen's boundary, Bell started returning to the pavilion for lunch without touching the crease, then Praveen threw the ball directly into the hands of Dhoni, who had run out to Bell
 dhoni ne jab bel ko waapas batting ke liye bulaane kaa faisla kiya tha jo stadium darshakon kii taaliyon kii gadgadaahat se gunj uthaa tha

 The issue of sealing in Delhi has taken a political thrust
 mangalvaar subah is mudde par dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke ghar baithak hui
 In which many leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party also participated
 baithak ke dauraan zordaar hangaamaa hua, media ke saamne hi kejariwal or dilli BJP adhyaksh manoj tiwari main tikhi bahes hui
 Meanwhile Arvind Kejriwal was repeatedly trying to convince BJP leaders

 Kejriwal is saying, "hey, sit down! Drink tea first! ''
 
 @arvindkejriwal graciously asked the BJP leaders to sit together and talk to the BJP leaders, but the BJP leaders ran away without talking while doing lousy politics! # bjpagainsttraderspic

 com / ur1dg4pler — AAP (@aamaadmiparty) January 30, 2018 Let us know that Kejriwal addressed the media after the meeting
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki hamane bijepi ke netaaon ko is mudde par charchaa ke liye bulaayaa tha
 Only 5 mps and 2 mayors came from the BJP
 unhone is mudde par akele main charchaa karne kii apil kii
 Kejriwal said that i appealed to the people of BJP to discuss in front of the media
 maine baar-baar unase apil kii to ve baithak chhod kar chale gaye
 The Delhi government will take the issue to the Supreme Court
 arvind kejariwal ne aarope lagaaya ki kareeb 351 sadakon par ceiling nahin ho rahi he, survey kii report abhi tak emsidi ne hamen nahin saunpi he
 He said that the MCD had sought two days time from Satyendra Jain, we will present this report before the Supreme Court

 On this issue, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari alleged that Kejriwal's goons shouted at him and abused him
 unhone kaha ki ham kejariwal ke ghar apni baat lekar gaye the, lekin unhone hamaari koi baat nahin suni ulta ham logon ko apamaanit kiya
 Tiwari said that this is the black day of history, the black day of politics
 koi bhi kisi ke ghar mehmaan banakar jaataa he to uske saath is tarah se budtamiji or use apamaanit nahin kiya jaataa
 Let us tell you that BJP leaders have also filed a police complaint regarding this issue

 Although, due to his exploits, he is often in the Uttar Pradesh police discussion, but today we are going to introduce you to one of the kindest policeman in UP who has set an example of humanity and put the positive aspect of the police in front of the society
 ispulice afsarne ek sadak haadase main ghayal do garib bacchiyon kaa ilaaj khud apane kharche se karaayaa he
 With the help of the policeman, both the girls are alive today, because their families did not have enough money to get them treated
 in donon bacchiyon ke ilaaj main ab tak yah police afasar 1,12, 000 se zyada rupee kharch kar chuke hai
 This police officer posted in Sakaldiha Circle of Chandauli district of UP is still reimbursing the expenses of the treatment of those girls
 bacchiyon ke parijan sahit gaanvvaale bhi ab is police afasar ko farista maanate hai
 Actually, in the evening of Janmashtami last month, both girls named Antima and Sanjana were passing through the road
 tabhi ek tej raftaar bike kii chapet main aane se donon gambhir rup se ghayal ho gayi
 The condition of the girls was very critical
 donon bacchiyaan behad garib parivaar se hai or inke gharavaale mazdooree karke kis tarah pet paalate hai
 In such a situation how these girls would be treated was a formidable problem, because the families of these two girls did not have the money to treat them
 is baat kii jaankaree jab dipti espi tripurari pandeya ko hui to unhone tatkaal apnaayetimcard nikaala or apane ek sipaahi ke saath in bacchiyon ko varanasi ke trama centre bheja taaki jaldi se inkaa ilaaj shuru ho sake or in bacchiyon kii jindagi bachaai ja sake
 The girls were kept in ICU for several days
 udhar parijan pareshaan the ki in donon ke ilaaj kaa lanbaa kharchaa kahaan se aayega
 But this generous police officer Tripurari Pandey not only admitted these girls to the hospital but also saved their lives by spending lakhs of rupees from their salary
 ye donon bacchiyaan aspataal se ab apane ghar vapaas aa gai hai, lekin ilaaj abhi bhi chal rahaa he or uskaa puraa kharch ab bhi tripurari pandeya vahan kar rahe hai
 The generosity of a policeman is being discussed everywhere
 vahiin bacchiyon ke parijan or gaanvvaale to ab tripurari pandeya ko bhagwaan kaa darja dene lage hai
 Rita Devi, the mother of the girls, told that our daughters would not have been alive today if the CO had not admitted our girls to the hospital
 bacchiyon ke naanaa ravindra rajbhar or gaanv kii mahila bimala devi ne bataaya ki sio tripurari pandeya ham logon ke liye bhagwaan banakar aae or na sirf donon bacchiyon kii jindagi bachaa lee balki aaj bhi ilaaj kaa kharch uthaa rahe hai
 Deputy SP Tripurari Pandey said that after reaching the spot and seeing the situation there, it was the first thought that it was necessary to save the lives of these two girls
 bacchiyon ke parijan kaaphi garib hai or paise ke abhaav main in bacchiyon kaa ilaaj prabhavit ho rahaa tha
 That is why i gave my ATM card to my soldier and sent him to the hospital with injured girls so that the lives of these girls would not be endangered due to lack of money
 unhone bataaya kii aaj bacchiyaan sahi salaamat hai yah unke liye sukun kii baat he

 However, they also say that this is the only way for the development of the country

" ' The Taliban has plagued Pakistan, but all efforts of Pakistan and American troops went waste in the Swat Valley
 lekin ab pakistan hamalaa karegaa taliban par
 Pakistan's Interior Affairs Minister Rehman Malik made this claim in his country's parliament
 pakistan ke switzraland kahe jane vaale swat ko aatankwaadiyon ke kabje se chhudaane ke liye ek khaas ranneeti banaai gayi he
 Pakistan has now decided to vacate its land from Taliban occupation
 paak ke pradhanmantri gilaani ke aantarik maamalon ke salaahkaar rahamaan malik ne pakistani seenet ko ye jaankaree di ki pakistan ke jananath swat ghati ko aatankwaadiyon se mukt karaane ke liye ek khaas ranneeti taiyaar ho chuki he
 Pakistan, which has always been crying out for its helplessness on the Taliban and al-qaeda, is today ruling the war against the Taliban
 paak fouj ke pramukh general kiyani ne 29 janvari ko swat kaa daura bhi kiya
 Kiani stated clearly that in the third phase of Operation rahe-haq against the Taliban, Swat will secure Pak army
 haalanki is daure kaa kitna mahatv he ye is oparation ke pehle do charan ke fail hone ke baad har koi samaj chukaa he
 The Swat Valley has been destroyed, the area which was called the Paradise of Pakistan till some time ago, has now been transformed into a world
 rahamaam malik ne swat main sakriy paanch aatankwaadi sanghathanon kaa khulaasa bhi kiya
 Yes, Swat currently holds al Qaeda, tehreek-taliban, tanzime-islami, Torah Bora Group and Kari Mushtaq Group
 pakistan ke mutabik wo ab inhen paanchon aatankwaadi sanghathanon ke khilaaf morcha kholane hi vaala he
 Claims are being made that all terrorist organizations will be eliminated from Swat in just a few weeks
 rahamaan malik to yahaan tak kah rahe hai ki nai ranneeti ke tahat talibaniyon kaa garh ban chukaa swat kaa ek kasbaa mingora par sarkaar kaa kabja ho chukaa he or halaat kaabo main hai
 Now, how much of these claims of Pakistan have the power, al-qaeda and tehreek-e-taliban, who are making Swat worse than hell, are being exposed every day
 mana ye bhi ja rahaa he ki pakistan apane is nae shigufe se duniya ko khaskar america or hindustan ko ye dikhaane kii koshish kar rahaa he ki haa, ham bhi aatankwaad ke khilaaf hai or ab apane ilaake main maujuud aatankwaadiyon ko khatm karnaa chaahate hai
 However, this new claim of Pakistan is truth or Shigufa, it is difficult to say anything about this because Pakistan has no involvement in maneuver
 pakistan ne taliban ko nestanabood karne kaa elaan to kar diya lekin taliban se aar paar kii jang pakistan kii chahat nahin majaburi he
 If Pakistan does not destroy the Taliban, then the Taliban will not leave Pakistan any work and the rulers of Pakistan have now realized this
 unhen ahsaas ho chukaa he ki taliban bahut teji se islamabad kii taraf bad rahaa he
 The fact is that if Pakistan continues to promote the organization of terrorists then the day is not far when Islamabad will also have a government of Taliban forces
 taliban auki al-kaayda kaa bhasmasur har roj islmabad kii satta ke kareeb pahunchataa ja rahaa he lekin pakistani hukumat ko khatre kaa sahi-sahi andaja shaayad ab tak nahin
 Pakistan's military and its intelligence agencies are still openly fomenting al-qaida and Taliban forces
 jabaki pakistan kaa ek bada hissaa yaa to jehadi takaton ke kabje main ja chukaa he yaa phir unke jabardast prabhaav main he
 Fata area adjoining Afghanistan border in North West Frontier Province
 kehane ko to ye pakistan kaa fedral administrated tribal aria he, lekin hakeekat main ye ban chukaa he talibanistan
 Here the slaughtering takes place on the orders of the Taliban
 unki adaalaton main log dete hai hajiri or sharia ke mutabik hoti he sunwaayee
 Such programs are issued on their radios, which can be ignored only by those who do not love their lives
 taliban auki alqaida ke dehshatgard har roj darjanon skool tabah kar rahe hai
 Because nothing except jihadi training
 swat ghati ke mingora shahar par apana kabza sabit karne ke liye taliban ne behad khaufnak rasta apanaaya he
 Whenever Taliban terrorists kill a policeman or a government prisoner, they throw their dead bodies at the main intersection of Mingora
 laashon ke saath hota he ek khat ki din main 11 baje se pehle agar kisi ne laashon ko hataaya, to agle din uski laash yaheen padi milegi
 The reality is that every moment of the lives of people living in a large area of pakistan is an affection for the Taliban and al-qaeda's mercy and if the Pakistani government still does not leave, then it is going to suffer the same as the millions of innocent people in Pakistan People's happening
 pakistan ne taliban se aarpaar kii ladaai kaa man to bana liya he
 But the biggest question is, will he be able to drive the Taliban out of his land? It took America eight years, but it has not been able to completely eliminate the Taliban and al-qaeda yet
 to phir pakistan taliban se kaise paar paaegaa?betaratib pyjama or haath main eke-47 liye talibani ladaake ab bhi duniya ke superpavar ko nako chanaa chabava rahe hai
 Since 9 / 11, the US military has been behind al-qaeda and the Taliban, but the success is still far from it
 aakhir aisa kyon he
 Why America has been struggling in the tribal areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan for 8 years? Why he has not been fully successful there yet? Why has it not eradicated al-qaeda and the Taliban so far? So there are many reasons for this
 pehali vajah he khud america kii niyat
 Actually, America's intention regarding the Taliban has not been clear from the beginning
 gauratlab he ki taliban ko kisi or ne nahin balki khud america ne khadaa kiya tha
 Against Russia in Afghanistan
 america apane makasad me kaamyaab bhi rahaa, rus ke tukade ho gaye
 But the same Taliban now became Bhasmasur for America
 kai america nitikaron ko lagata he ki osama-bin laden ko pakadaney ke liye taliban se samjhauta kiya ja saktaa he
 Osama's al-qaeda was confined to the tribal areas of tora-bora after an 8-year-long battle
 uskaa network bhi kamazor hua
 The intelligence system also did not work very well, but the Taliban became even more powerful in these eight years
 taliban par kaabo paane main america fouj ko kai dikkatein bhi aa rahi hai
 The biggest force of the US military in Afghanistan is airstrikes
 bi 52 vimaan kaa vahaan jabardast khoff he
 But the Taliban also found a way to avoid it by getting into the crowd
 vahaan kii janata ko bhi videshi fouj se zyada taliban par hi bharosa he
 These people are also the eyes and ears of the Taliban
 jisaki vajah se jamini ladaai main america fouj kargar nahin ho paa rahi
 Because Talibanis already get news of every action of American army
 america fouj kii mushkil afghanistan kii bhugolic sthiti or taliban ke gorilla waar main maharath se or bad jaati hai
 Many of the US military's omissions also could not link it to the public against the Taliban
 july 2002 main khufia soochna ke aadhaar par america sena ne oruzagan pahari par talibani camp par missile se hamalaa kiya tha
 But the missile fell to a residential settlement in which more than 40 people were killed
 kai baar chaape ke dauraan bhi america sena kii badsuluki afgani janata ko uskaa dushman bana baithi
 In such a situation, he never got the support of the public
 afgaan kii hagamid karzai sarkaar se bhi america ko kaaphi ummiden thi lekin karzai ke sur bhi ab badalane lage hai
 They talk about development, but they bite on the issue of tightening the Taliban
 dekhne vaali baat yah hogi ki pakistan taliban par nakel kasne ke dauraan in tamaam dikkaton se kaise paar paata he? The Municipal Corporation of Delhi, which is suffering from poor financial condition, has received a major setback from the central government
 kendriya mantri hardip puri ne dilli nagar nigam ko philhal nae fund dene se inkaar kar diya he
 Actually on Wednesday evening, all three of the Dillinagar Corporation had reached their office with the Mayor Commissioner to meet Union Urban Development Minister Hardeep Puri
 nigam kii kharaab haalat dekhte hue teenon hi meyar ko aashaa thi ki centre sarkaar se unhen ek acha raahat package milegaa, lekin sutara bataate hai ki puraane fund kaa ab tak sahi se byoraa na die jane kii vajah se kendriya mantri hardip puri ne naaraazgi jataate hue ek bhi nayaa paisa dene se inkaar kar diya
 The opposition took a pinch as soon as the opposition got the information it became an attacker
 dakshini dilli nagar nigam menam aadmi partike vipaksh ke netaa praveen kumaar ne nigam kii sthiti par bijepi sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa to vahiin uttari dilli nagar nigam ke vipaksh ke netaa anil lakada ne bhi nigam kii khastahal haalat par chutki lee
 Anil Lakra said that now even the central government has withdrawn its hand from the MCD
 hardip puri ne teenon hi nigamon ko puraane fund kaa thik se hisaab na dene par fatkaar lagaai
 The minister said that instead of asking for funds, the corporation itself should take such measures so that they can become self-sufficient
 sutara bataate hai ki kamishnar ne centre sarkaar ke anayuzd fund se paise dene kii maang kii jise hardip puri ne inkaar kar diya
 However, Mayor of South Delhi Municipal Corporation Narendra Chawla has denied being reprimanded
 unhone kaha ki aisi koi baat nahin he or na hi fund dene se inkaar kiya gaya
 The bus minister lacked some technical points in the old book
 use puraa karke laane ko kaha he
 After that a new fund will be given
 BREXIT yani britain kaa european union se agsit hona
 Britain is out of the European Union in historical references
 janamat sangrah kaa faisla aane ke baad bharat samet duniyabar ke share bazaar main iskaa asar dekhne ko mila he
 But first of all it is also important to know why the demand for Britain to secede from the EU arose? What harm can happen to India due to separation and what is the European Union
 kyon uthi iyu se britain ke alag hone kii maang?saal 2008 main great britain kii arthvyavastha mandi kii chapet main aa gai
 Unemployment has increased in the country
 isaki vajah se ek bahes ne janm liya ki kya britain ko european union se alag ho janaa chahie? is maang ko 2015 main britain main hue aam chunaavon menunited kingdom independenceparty (eukeipi) ne uthaaya
 This faction believes that if Britain breaks away from the European Union, then all the problems of the country will go away
 janamatsangrah kii jarurat kyon padi?britain main hi ek dhada yah bhi maanata he ki britain kaa european union se alag hona desh ke liye bada jhatka hoga
 The Prime Minister David Cameron and the Conservative Party believe the same
 britain ke nagarikon kii raay bhi is masale par banty hui he
 Therefore, it was considered right to hold referendum on the matter
 takreebab 4 karod 60 lakh log janamatsangr main hissaa lene ke yogya hai
 Britain will benefit - Britain will not have to pay $ 9 billion for the European Union budget annually
 - britain kii simaaon par bina roak-tok ke awajahi par lagaam lagegi
 - The loss to Britain due to free visa policy will also be reduced
 britain ko nuksaan- british jidipi ko 1 se 3 pratishat nuksaan kaa anumaan
 - Single market system will end for the UK
 - duusare europea deshon main britain ko kaarobaar se judi dikkatein hongi
 - Britain's dominance over the entire European Union will end
 kya he european union?-28 europea deshon kaa sanghathan he iyu
 In 1957, 6 countries (belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands) laid the foundation
 - saal 2015 tak ke aankadon ke mutabik european union kii aabaadi 50 karod se zyada
 - All its member countries have the same currency
 - EU main shaamil deshon ke naagarik28 deshon main se kisibhi desh main rah sakate hai or vyapaar (free trade) kar sakate hai
 Loss to India - Pound can fall by 12 percent if Britain breaks away from EU
 - kamjor pound kii vajah se dollar kii maang main ijapha hoga
 - Due to the strong dollar, the price of rupee can reach 70 level
 bhartiya vaanijya mantralay ke data ke mutabik 2015-16 main britain ke saath bharat kaa dwipaksheeya vyapaar 14
 02 billion dollars i
e
 945 billion rupees
 khaas baat yah he ki hamane britain se 5
 19 billion dollars imported and 8
 83 arab dollar kaa niryaat kiya
 India 3 in this business
 64 arab dollar kaa phayda hua
 According to some studies, Britain's imports from the EU will reduce its imports by 25 percent
 aise main bharat ke kaarobaar ko nuksaan ho saktaa he
 The eu's 'entry gate' for India is the only 800 Indian companies in Britain
 jisamen 1 lakh se zyada log kaam karte hai
 6 to 18 percent of Indian IT companies earn from the UK
 bhartiya companiyaan britain ke raste hi europe ke 28 deshon tak pahunchati hai
 If Britain exits the EU this access will be closed
 europe ke deshon se bharat ko nae qaraar karne honge
 This will increase the expenses of companies
 saath hi har desh ke niyam-kanoonon ko bhi paalan karnaa hoga

 court ne jakia jaafaree kii yachika ko khaarij kar diya
 Made it clear that the riot case will not work on Modi
 modi ne is faisle ke baad twit kiya, satyamev jayate! Truth alone triumphs
 However Magistrate BJ Ganatra has also said that Zakia Jafri has full right to move the upper court against this decision
 aapako bataa den ki esaiti ne 2002 ke sampradayik danga maamle main gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi or 58 anya ko clinit di he
 The petition was challenged by Zakia Jafri
 ab tak kya-kya hua?jakia jaafaree ne aarope lagaaya tha ki modi ne senior mantriyon, adhikariyon or police ke saath milakar rajya main dange hone die
 The investigation into the allegations leveled by Zakia began by the SIT team constituted by the Supreme Court in March 2008
 chaar saal ke baad esaiti ne farvari 2012 main kaha ki modi va anya aropiyon ke khilaaf koi saboot nahin hai jiske dam par cese chalaaya ja sake
 The SIT filed a closure report, calling for the investigation to end
 aapako bataa den ki congress ke purv saansad ehsaan jaafaree ahmedabad ke gulburg socity ke un 58 logon main the jinaki hatya ugr bheed ne 28 farvari 2002 ko kar di
 SIT had questioned Modi in 2010 which lasted for about 9 hours
 2011 main supreme court ne is maamle par sunwaayee karne se yah kehete hue inkaar kar diya ki isaki sunwaayee ahmedabad kii adaalat hi karegi
 In April 2011, Sanjiv Bhatt, a suspended police officer of the Gujarat Police, claimed that Modi had instructed him and other police officers in a meeting to allow the Hindu rioters to avenge the deaths of 59 karsevaks killed in the Sabarmati Express
 haalanki SIT ne kaha ki sanjeev bhatta kii gavaahi vishwasaneey nahin he kyonki rajya sarkaar dwaara nilambit kiye jane ke kaaran unke man main durbhaavna hai
 The SIT had also alleged that the petition was politically motivated which was filed at the behest of social activist Teesta Setalvad

 The condition of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is very critical
 unhen dilli ke AIIMS main phul life saport par rakhaa gaya he
 Vajpayee was the first leader of the country to become a non-congress Prime Minister
 chunaav jeetne or haarane ko lekar kai kirtiman desh ke vibhinn rajanetaaon ke naam par darj hai, lekin vaajapeyi ke naam par do atal kirtiman darj hai
 Vajpayee is the only politician in the country who has represented six Lok Sabha constituencies in four states
 uttar pradesh ke lakhanu or balrampur, gujarat ke gandhinagar, madhyapradesh ke gwalior or vidisha or dilli kii nai dilli sansadeey seat se chunaav jeetne vaale vaajapeyi eklaute netaa hai
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee was born on 25 December 1924, this day is called the big day in India
 vaajapeyi 1942 main raajnneeti main us samay aae, jab bharat chodo andolan ke dauraan unke bhai 23 dinon ke liye jail gaye
 When the Bharatiya Jana Sangh Party was formed in 1951 with the support of the RSS, Atal Bihari Vajpayee played an important role along with leaders like Shyama Prasad Mukherjee
 saal1952 main atal bihari vaajapeyi pehali baar lakhanu loksabhaa seat se ladaa, par safalataa nahin mili
 He contested a by-election in a Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh where he had to face defeat
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ko pehali baar safalataa 1957 main lagi
 In 1957, the Jana Sangh contested them from three Lok Sabha seats Lucknow, Mathura and Balrampur
 lakhanu main wo chunaav haar gaye, mathura main unki zamaanat jabt ho gai lekin balrampur sansadeey seat se chunaav jitkar loksabhaa pahunche
 Seeing the extraordinary personality of Vajpayee, the then Prime Minister of that time, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, said that this person would definitely become the Prime Minister in the coming days
 vaajapeyi tisare loksabhaa chunaav 1962 main lakhanu seat se utre, lekin unhen jeet nahin mil saki
 He was then elected a Rajya Sabha member
 iske baad 1967 main phir loksabhaa chunaav lade or lekin jeet nahin sake
 This was followed by a by-election in 1967, where he won and became a parliamentarian
 iske baad 1968 main vaajapeyi rashtriya jansangh ke rashtriya adhyaksh bane
 At that time there were leaders like Nanaji Deshmukh, Balraj Madhok and Lal Krishna Advani with the party
 1971 main paanchaven loksabhaa chunaav main atal bihari vaajapeyi madhya pradesh ke gwalior sansadeey seat se utre or jitkar sansad pahunche
 He represented the New Delhi parliamentary constituency in the 1977 post-emergency and then mid-term elections in 1980
 1984 main atal bihari ne madhya pradesh ke gwalior se loksabhaa chunaav kaa parchaa daakhil kar diya or unke khilaaf achaanak congress ne madhavrao sindhiya ko khadaa kar diya
 Whereas Madhavrao used to come from Guna parliamentary constituency
 sindhiya se vaajapeyi paune do lakh voton se haar gaye
 Let me tell you that Atal Bihari also once mentioned that he himself had asked Madhavrao in the corridor of Parliament that he would not contest from Gwalior
 madhavrao ne us samay manaa kar diya tha, lekin congress kii ranneeti ke tahat achaanak unka parchaa daakhil kara diya gaya
 In this way, Vajpayee did not have a chance to file nomination from elsewhere
 aise main unhen sindhiya se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa

 Swamy questioned that "kapil Sibal will side against the Ram temple in the court for a hefty fee from the Sunni Waqf Board

 However, the Congress later clarified that it was not his signature

 The former cricketers are also surprised by this decision of the selectors, as it was in 2003 that along with Rahul Dravid, Parthiv Patel and in 2007 with Dhoni, Dravid was kept in the team as an alternate wicketkeeper
 is baar bharat kii tarah anya kisi bhi team ne haalanki wicketcaping jaise mahatvapurn sthaan ke liye aisa jokhim nahin uthaaya he
 Four-time champions Australia have two specialist wicketkeepers in their squad in the form of Brad Haddin and Tim Paine

 In Rajasthan, the Congress is unable to release its list of candidates and these delays are getting minute by minute on those who want to get tickets
 mana ja rahaa tha ki somvaar ko congress varking cameti kii baithak main tikat kaa faisla ho jayega
 But the dispute among the big leaders of Rajasthan is so deep that even the meeting of Congress Working Committee could not end the quarrel over tickets
 rajasthan congress ke adhyaksh sachin payalat or congress mahasachiv ashok gahalot ke bich tikat ko lekar maaramaari jari he
 Meanwhile, there are reports that in the Rajasthan Assembly, the fight between Congress leader Rameshwar Doody and Sachin Pilot has escalated to such an extent that till late Monday night, Ashok Gehlot continued to agree with both sides and now once again - Discussion is going on rajasthan congress kaa jhagada is baat ko lekar he ki party satta main aati he to mukhyamantri koun banegaa
 All kinds of surveys are showing that the Congress is coming to power
 aise main netaaon ke mukhyamantri banane kii laalasaa badhati ja rahi he
 The way Rahul Gandhi has not led any leader in Rajasthan
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki vidhayak dal kii baithak main siem pad ko lekar faisla ho saktaa he
 That is, the more the chance of a leader becoming the MLA, the more he will have the chance of becoming the chief minister and this is also the root of the quarrel
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki somvaar ko seedblusi kii meeting ke baad yah tay ho gaya tha ki raat ko congress se kareeb 100 se lekar 110 ummidavaaron kii suchi jari kar di jaaegi, lekin sonia gandhi ke ghar baithak main rameshwar dudi or sachin payalat ke bich jamkar tu-tu main-main ho gai
 Some seats got so hot that Sachin Pilot said that if i do not give tickets on these seats as per my suggestion, then i will leave politics
 tamtamaate hue dudi ne bhi kah diya ki kal chhodana he to aaj chhod do, lekin tumhaare manmarjee se tikat nahin bate jaaenge
 It is being said that in seats like Nohar Sanwaria and Phulera, Sachin Pilot wants to fight someone else while Gehlot and Doody want to fight their people
 is tarah kii ek darjan siten hai jahaan par vivaad khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 There is also a dispute over leaders like Babulal Nagar from Dudu, Ramlal Jat from a seat in Bhilwara
 tikat bantwaare par kyon ho rahaa hangaamaadrasal payalat gut or ashok gahalot gut donon hi chahta he ki kam se kam 80 aise logon ko tikat dilavaayen jo unhen mukhyamantri banane main madad karen
 Apart from this, it is still not decided that Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot will contest the assembly elections
 party kaa ek mat yah he ki donon bade netaaon ko prachaar karnaa chahie jabaki ashok gahalot chaahate hai ki apni paramparaagat seat sardarpura se chunaav lade jabaki sachin payalat vidhansabha chunaav kabhi nahi lade hai
 It is being said that the Gehlot faction wants Sachin Pilot to contest the assembly elections, while the leader of Pilot's side wants that both big leaders on the lines of Madhya Pradesh do not contest
 lekin agar ashok gahalot chunaav ladate hai to sachin payalat bhi chunaav ladenge kyonki vidhayak dal kii baithak main jo vyakti maujuud hoga uski sthiti majboot ho sakati he
