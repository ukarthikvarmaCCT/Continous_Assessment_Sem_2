 The neighboring country, which does not desist from its antics, has fired once again in Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch on Wednesday evening
 taaja firing main abhi tak kisi ke hataahat hone kii koi khabar nahin he, jabaki sena ne apni ore se javaabi karrwai kii he
 According to the information, Pakistani Rangers have opened fire from across the border in Balakot and Hamirpur in Poonch district at around 7 pm on Wednesday
 firing lagaataar jari he, jabaki bhartiya kheme ne bhi bina kisi uksaave ke kii gai is golibari kaa makul jawaab diya he
 Interestingly expressed in Islamabad, the interesting thing is that Pakistan summoned Indian Deputy High Commissioner JP Singh in Islamabad on Wednesday
 is dauraan pakistani videsh mantrayal ne bhartiya sainikon parabina uksaave ke golibarika aarope lagaaya or isamen goli lagane se ek sainik ke maare jane ko lekar virodh jataayaa
 In such a situation, Pakistan's dual attitude at the level of border and politics is once again known
 khaas baat yah bhi he ki beete dinon dilli main donon mulkon ke bich diji str kii baatcheet hui he, jisamen sijafire ko lekar nae sire se samjhauta hua he
 But despite this, its neighboring country has been violating ceasefire continuously since then
 beete kuch dinon se lagaataar firingmangalvaar ko bhi poonch ke krishnaghati ilaake main pakistan kii ore se golibari kii gai thi
 Regarding Tuesday's incident, a defense spokesman said that Pakistani troops opened automatic mortars and fired mortars at forward posts along the Line of Control in the Krishna Valley at around seven in the morning
 paak sainikon ne 82 mem ke mortar bam kaa istemaal kiya
 The spokesman said that Pakistani troops targeted forward posts along the Line of Control in Balakot sector with automatic weapons from 6
20 pm to 9 pm on Monday evening
 unhone bataaya ki niyantran rekha par tainaat bhartiya javaanon ne javaabi karrwai kii or ilaake se aakhri khabar aane tak golibari jari thi

 Two people talk on the phone
 baatcheet main shaadi kii taiyaari kaa zikr he
 When it comes to the date of marriage, the answer is given, the same is already decided on December 4
 duusari taraf se badhai milti he or phone kaat diya jaataa he
 This conversation is very common
 itnaa ki koi bhi samaj saktaa tha ki do log phone par shaadi kii taiyaari kii baat kar rahe hai
 But this brief conversation gave the intelligence agencies of India the plan of a terrible terrorist attack, which if successful, corpses would be spread everywhere
 yah plan ek aatankwaadi hamale kaa tha jise rajdhani dilli main anjaam diya janaa tha
 Actually sitting in Pakistan, this phone came from Pakistan
 udhar se aatankwaadi sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyyaba kaa commander javed baluchi dilli ke najadik mevaat main maujuud ek sandigdh aatankwaadi subhaan se baatcheet kar rahaa tha
 Behind the wedding preparations and the date talks, there was a plan for a big attack on the Delhi assembly election day, but this conversation in code-language was not only intercepted by the intelligence agencies, but before December 4, the let seated in Hindustan Reaching the puppets also exposed this plot
 intelligens beuro yani ibi ne ye kol intercept kii or udhar dilli police kii special cell kii team is sajeesh main shaamil chehron ko dabochne mevaat ke liye ravaanaa ho gai
 From there, the police arrested two of Subhan's associates Rashid and Shahid, but Subhan managed to escape
 subhaan kii giraftaar ke liye dilli or rajasthan kii aties team lagaataar chhapemari kar rahi he
 This module of terror was demolished by the police after the arrest of Rashid and Shahid in Muzaffarnagar with the arrest of the youth who were victims of the riots
 police ne giraftaar logon ke sampark main jitne log the, sabhi ko contact kiya
 It was here that the police came to know that Rashid and Shahid went to Deoband
 ye donon devband ke ek teacher likaayat or devband ke liye duusare shaks jameer ke sampark main bhi aae the
 According to police sources, lashkar-e-taiba was eyeing the Muzaffarnagar riot victims
 ye log apane aakaaon ke kehane par danga peediton ko lashkar main shaamil karne ke liye sampark kar rahe the
 According to sources, Shahid, arrested from Mewat, has also got a diary containing the names of several boys from Muzaffarnagar

 It became clear that the way the terrorists sitting in Pakistan had chosen the way to bloom India, it had to pass through the streets of Muzaffarnagar, suffering from the riots
 rahul gandhi ne teen maheene pehle bayaan diya tha ki unhen jaankaree mili he ki aatanki mujffarnagar ke danga peediton se sampark saadhane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Trying to seduce them
 haalanki lashkar ke mujffarnagar conection kaa uttar pradesh sarkaar sire se khandan kar rahi he
 According to UP government Principal Secretary AK Gupta, 'there is no news of terrorists contacting the riot victims in the camp
 hamane mujffarnagar or shamali ke dm se baat kii he, unhen bhi aisi koi jaankarinhin he
 Neither the Central Government informed us nor the Delhi Police

 One of the problems of our mutual brotherhood, which was born out of misunderstandings, are the terrorist organizations of the neighboring country really trying to widen it
 phir chaahe congress apni peeth thapthapaae or baaki raajnneetik partiyaan ise kuch bhi bataaen, lekin satark aam aadmi ko rahanaa hoga
 Today the security agencies were circumspect, vigilant, but the whole country would have to be vigilant ahead

 Former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Ajit Jogi is once again in the news
 loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey aane ke ek maheene baad purv siem ne yah kahkar sabko chaunkaa diya he ki durg loksabhaa seat par saroj pandey ko haraane ke liye bijepi ke netaaon ne unase madad maangi thi
 He also claimed that BJP leaders had offered money for this
 jogi kaa yah bayaan us samay aayaa he jab saroj kii haar par bijepi main kaanaafoosee ho rahi he
 Of the 11 Lok Sabha seats in the state, BJP has lost only in Durg
 saat siton par to jeet kaa antar lakh voton kaa he
 On the defeat of Saroj Pandey in the fort, despite Narendra Modi's wave, Jogi says that factionalism is more in BJP than Congress
 saroj pandey ko unki hi party ke log jeetne nahin dena chaahate the
 Some BJP leaders came in contact with him during the election, he also talked about giving money to defeat Saroj Pandey
 jogi ne kaha ki bhitarghaat keval congress main nahin hua, bijepi main bhi jamkar bhitarghaat hua
 Its effect was seen in many places
 durg main yah zyada najar aayaa
 Congress state president Bhupesh Baghel refused to comment on Jogi's statement
 haalanki, bijepi ne jogi ke daavon ko khaarij kar diya he
 BJP state organization general secretary Ram Pratap Singh said that Congress should review its defeat
 bijepi ne ekajutata ke saath chunaav ladaa or jeet bhi darj kii
 Lost one seat, so it is wrong to say factionalism
 balki ekta thi isliye ham 10 siten jite
 The Congress itself has been winning only one seat for the last three elections

 Pakistan, which is pretending to sing peace songs after the Pulwama terror attack, is not deterring its antics

 Pakistan has started firing on the border since late Monday, after which Pakistan ceasefire violations have been going on since then
 somvaar der raat pakistani sena ne rajouri sector main sthit rihaayshi ilaakon main firing kii
 Pakistan has been breaking ceasefire for the last several days
 Let us tell you that since the terrorist attack in Pulwama on February 14, there has been a situation of tension between India and Pakistan
 is tanaav kaa asar seemaa par bhi dikh rahaa he, yahi kaaran he ki pakistan har din sijafire tod rahaa he or har baar hi use munh kii khaani pad rahi he
 Even before this, Pakistan has been continuously breaking ceasefire since the past
 pakistan ne beete hafte poonch, rajouri sector main sijafire todaa tha
 Then mortars were being fired continuously from Pakistan
 gauratlab he ki pakistan border se aatankiyon kii ghuspaith karaane ke liye is prakaar kii harakat karata he taaki bhartiya sena kaa dhyaan bhatke
 The accusations that Pakistan is making a furious Pakistan has been blown away by the strong response of India and is blaming Hindustan on the contrary
 mangalvaar subah pakistan sena ke pravaktaa major general asif gafoor ne aarope lagaaya ki bhartiya vayusena ke kuch vimaan line of control (loc) paar kar us paar ghus gaye hai
 Tension on the border, impact on trade: The tension of both countries is visible not only on the border but also on business

 After Cyrus Mistry's departure from Tata Sons, the search for a new chairman of the group is on and once again Noel Tata, the step-brother of the group's interim chairman Ratan Tata, is being considered in the list of key contenders
 noel, tata international ke managing diarector hai tathaa group kii retail company trent ke chairman hai

 Earlier in 2012, Noel was cited as a contender for the post of chairman of Tata Sons when Ratan Tata's successor was launched
 khud ratan tata ne us samay sienen international ke tok asia kaarykram main die ek intervyuu main noel ko tata group main apana uttaradhikari hone kaa daavedaar mana tha, lekin tab baaji sirus mistre ne maar lee thi

 In such a situation, BJP will try to confuse Kejriwal on these issues

 With her dream, a girl reaches Mumbai hundreds of miles from Delhi
 yaheen use apane sapanom main rang bharna he
 But before this is possible, someone spoils all his dreams
 ab uski jindagi par ek-ek din baari gujarata he or phir ek rose wo apane ghar waapas laut aati he, lekin taabut main kaid hokar
 On 1 May 2013, at 3
40 pm, a train ran from Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Station, Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Station, Delhi
 sapanom kii nagari mumbai ke liye
 And in this train, 23-year-old Preity Rathi of Delhi came out to make her dreams come true
 mumbai ke army hospital main use nurse kii naukari mil gai thi
 On May 2, 2013, at 7
55 am, Bandra Terminal Railway Station, Mumbai had reached delhi-mumbai Garib Rath Station at the right time
 priti train se utarati he or platform par saikadon musafiron ke saath kadam se kadam mila kar chalane lagati he
 But then suddenly an anonymous young man comes and throws acid on Preeti
 stesan par sisitivi camere lage the
 Incidentally, the camera angle was not reaching the place where acid was thrown on Preeti
 alabatta thik usee vakt camere ke ek duusare angel se ek ladkaa ghabaraaya hua teji se bhaagta zarur najar aata he
 During this incident, the police believe that this person has thrown acid on Preeti after seeing this young man running from the same place
 lihaaza sisitivi footage ke aadhaar par uskaa sketch bhi taiyaar kar liya jaataa he
 Felt that the acid thrower will not survive
 magar tejaab se buree tarah ghayal priti puure maheene bhar aspataal main saanson se ladati rahati he
 She keeps on living every moment
 par uskaa gunahagaar pakadaa nahi jaataa
 And then finally on June 1, she loses her breath
 ek may ko wo dilli se ankhon main hajaar sapane liye mumbai ke liye nikali thi
 But on June 1, those eyes were closed which had many dreams
 ek may ko priti dilli tu mumbai gai thi
 a full month later, on June 2, Preeti was again on her journey
 is baar mumbai tu dilli
 She was returning
 par taabut main kaid hokar
 She came out of her house to fulfill dreams, but only halfway, someone shattered her dreams
 puure ek maheene tak usne jitna dard saha, maut se pehle usne usee shiddat ke saath apana haal-e-dil bhi bayaan kiya
 Now she could not speak, but she wanted to tell something by writing with her own hands
 aakhir kya chaahati thi priti? or kya ummid thi use aapse?puure tees din wo aspataal main apni saanson se ladati rahi
 For the whole thirty days, she kept suffering the acid
 puure tees din tak wo apane hi chehre se apni nazaren churaati rahi
 And then after thirty days his spirit finally left the body which was his biggest enemy
 jisaki chahat kisi ko darinda bana sakati thi
 she lost
 par haarane se pehle wo apane har dard, har jajbaat, har khushi, har gam har ashanka sab kuch bayaan kar gai
 On blank paper
 ab sawaal ye he ki usne jo likhaa wo aap kyon padhein? usne jo kaha wo aap kyon sunen? jabaki use bhi pataa tha or aapako bhi maaloom he ki naa uske kuch likhane se badalane vaala naa aapke kuch sunne se
 But what to do ab wo likh kar chali gai he to aapako padhanaa hi padegaa
 So leave these things to what will make a difference or will anything change
 bas padhane ke liye hi pard lijie
 i was following my aunt
 tabhi achaanak kisi ne kuch phenkaa
 i did not realize wo gora tha yaa kaala
 i was very jealous
 mai tadap rahi thi
 Had my aunt not been with me, i would not have survived that day
 ab tak to ghar main sabko pataa lag gaya hoga
 Will take mommy and tension
 maine ieneses kii naukari ke liye bahut taiyaari kii thi
 Worked very hard
 leftinent nurse kii naukari paakar main bahut khush thi
 i do not want to leave this job
 par ab meri ye naukari shaayad chali gai
 The doctors are not telling me anything here
 surgery kab hogi, ye plaster kab hatega
 How many more days will we stay here? There is also a pen in the hand movement since yesterday evening
 pehle nahin tha
 i asked doctor, my right eye is bad
 unhone bataaya ki jab tak transplant nahin hogi main nahin dekh paaungi
 And the transplant will not happen until i recover from the face
 papa, mujhe nikki or tannu kii bhi puri security karwaani he, main nahin chaahati jo mere saath hua wo unke saath bhi ho
 Mommy father had started seeing relationships for me too
 par mujhe ab sundar nahin dikhnaa
 Whenever Preeti wrote, she also asked a question
 sawaal ye ki aakhir uskaa ye haal kisne kiya? uskaa kya kasoor tha? kya uskaa mujrim pakadaa gaya? par afsos jate-jate bhi priti ko uske in sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin mil paaya
 Was the attack on Preeti due to any enmity or did the assailant make Preeti his victim in deception? The Railway Police, which is investigating the case, also has a picture of Preity's culprit and a sketch according to the eyewitnesses
 lekin bas isi ek sawaal kaa jawaab nahin dhundh paane kii vajah se wo priti ke qaatil tak nahin pahunch paa rahi he
 The CCTV footage recorded on Bandra Terminal's platform number three, which had raised hopes of Priti's culprit, after a month passed, now that hope has broken like Preeti's breath
 is footage main ek shaks thik usee taraf se tezi se bhagkar aata dikh rahaa he, jidhar chand seconds pehle priti ke upar tezaab phenkaa gaya tha
 Actually, due to lack of camera in the place where Preeti was attacked, no picture of that place could be captured in CCTV
 lekin jis tarah vaardaat ke baad ye shaks bhaagta hua dikhaa, use police ko lagane laga ki ho naa ho yahi priti kaa gunahagaar he
 After this, the police also prepared a sketch of the attacker, as he felt that this incident could be the result of a conspiracy and it is quite possible that the attacker arrived here from Delhi in pursuit of him
 lekin police kii dushmani kii theory ke ulat naa to is vaardaat ke baad priti ko priti ko kisi par shaq tha or naa hi uske gharavaalon ko
 So, the police tried to find Preeti mobile phone call details of her culprit
 lekin isamen bhi wo naakaam rahi
 Now the question is whether the attack on Preeti is of Mistaken Identity
 And if this matter is of enmity, then why are the hands of the police empty? However, whatever the GRP may have the answers to these questions, the demand for a probe by the CBI is now arising
 tejabi zakhmon se puure ek maheene tak jujhane ke baad aakhirkaar priti ne is duniya ko alavida kah diya, lekin priti kii vidaai se pehle dilli ko ek baar phir gussa aayaa
 Anger, society, police, law
 or sabase zyada us soch se, jo insaan ko jaanavar bana detaa he
 The anger of the people once again erupted
 ek baar phir aasmaan main gunji insaaf kii maang
 Sometimes in the presence of candle march, sometimes people with coffin once again landed on the streets
 is baar logon kaa gussa phuta he, mumbai ke bandra ke us darinde ke khilaaf jisane 2 may kii subah dilli kii beti priti par kuch aisa tejabi hamalaa kiya ki ek maheene baad uski jaan hi chali gai
 Well, in the case of Vasantkunj gangrape and dolls, the Delhi Police arrested the culprits of these girls after a short time, but in the case of Preity, the identity of her culprit has not yet been found and this is the biggest reason for the anger of the people
 is
 mumbai ke bombai hospital se jab priti kii maut kii khabar pehali baar baahar nikali, tabhi logon kaa gussa foot padaa
 The women, led by an NGO in Mumbai, raised justice for Preeti, who herself had suffered an acid attack
 ye sabhi log priti ke hamalavar ko jald se jald dabochne kii maang kar rahe the
 On the other hand, in the evening, hundreds of people took a candle march in Narela, away from Mumbai, and expressed their anger in front of the police station for hours
 iske baad somvaar ko jab priti taabut main kaid hokar aakhri baar apane ghar pahunchi, to tamaam logon ke saath-saath uske gharavaalon ne bhi apane gusse or afsos kaa izhaar kiya
 The family demanded to call Sonia Gandhi and Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit at Priti's funeral, give her state honors and get the case investigated by the CBI and bluntly said that until these things are considered, she will Will not perform the last rites
 unhone priti kii taabut ke saath hi narela main road jam kar der tak pradrarshan kiya
 However, when the SDM of the area demanded that their demands be passed on to the government and cremation of Preity with police honors, the protesters were softened
 ab priti beshak panch tatv main villin ho chuki ho, lekin is maamle kii jaanch sibiai se karaane or uske gunahagaar ko sajaa dilaane kii maang ab bhi kaayam he

 In a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Finance Shiv Pratap Shukla said, "the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said that it has received complaints from common people that banks are not accepting coins
" ’’ haalanki, mantri ne kaha ki in shikayaton main kisi khaas bank kaa naam nahin likhaa he
 He also said that the RBI, through one of its circulars on the facility of exchange of notes and coins, has advised banks to accept coins for transactions and exchange at all their branches
 shukla ne yah bhi kaha ki arabiai kii kshetreey shakhaon ko nirdesh die gaye hai ki ve aam logon se sikke sweekaar karne ke liye counter kholen or apane adhikaar kshetra ke tahat aane vaale bainkon ke niyantrakon ko salaah den ki sabhi shakhaon main sikke sweekaar kiye jaaen
 In response to another question related to coins, Minister of State for Finance Radhakrishnan said that the legal validity of coins has been clarified under Section 6 of the Indian Coinage Act, 2011 and the Reserve Bank of India has advised the common people to take all their transactions
 Please accept 10 rupee coins as valid currency

 i never ask in the field who you will vote for
 is sawaal main meri dilchaspee nahin hoti he
 i definitely want to see what kind of information and perceptions a voter prepares himself to vote for
 baagpat zile ke kai naujavaanon se mila
 Like urban youth, no one has said or expressed that they know me
 main aise hi naujavaanon ke bich janaa chahta tha jo mujhe thik se nahin jaanate hon
 The total number of these youth would have been 70-80 comfortably or even more
 ye sabhi sarkari pratiyogita parikshaon kii taiyaari karne vaale noujvaan hai
 Whose issues i have been raising continuously for a year and a half
 mere kaaryakramon ko in naujavaanon tak shat-pratishat na pahunchane dene ke kai kaaran ho sakate hai par meraa focus yah nahin tha
 Not everyone needs to know me
 in naujavaanon se baat karne ke apane anubhav saajha karnaa chahta hum
 The youth did not do modi-modi like 2014 in their own way
 2014 ke chunaavon main kisi ke saamne mike rakhte hi modi-modi shuru ho jaataa tha
 modi-modi used to answer any question
 is baar ek baar bhi aisa nahin hua
 Won't these youth vote for Modi? Even after this wave did not happen, it certainly did not happen
 kyonki mukhar hokar saport karne waalon ne khud se mukhar hokar nahin kaha ki is baar sabak sikhaa denge
 My questions were limited to the quality of employment and education, but many times the success of the dock media was seen in the sequence of answers
 godi media modi kii raajnneeti kaa sabase safal upkram he
 The BJP has only reached the point of youth
 bijepi ke aarope or tark pahunche hai
 Their world of information is made up of the same information that i call propaganda
 sudur ilaakon main mukhyadhara se lekar nijee str par soochna sansar se vipaksh or vaikalpik soochnaaon kii safai ho chuki he
 During the discussion of talks on the tongue of youth, opposition always came from bjp's logic
 vipaksh ne bijepi ke bare main jo kaha he, us hawaale se kisi ne bijepi par sawaal nahin kiya
 Political discussion has become unilateral
 uski swaabhaaviktaa main vividhta mit chuki he
 Opposition has disappeared from the natural discussions of the youth
 iske liye vipaksh bhi doshi he
 The opposition did not use an alternative mode of communication
 jo unke sanghathanon kaa dhaancha tha, uskaa istamaal nahin kiya
 They still begin their day by looking at the newspaper and channel where they do not and will not be
 maine aise kai matadaata dekhe jinke dimaag main vipakshaheenata kii sthiti ban chuki he
 This may not happen but i thought so
 aage or naujavaanon se miloongaa, jaise jaise anubhav badalegaa, likhuunga
 i met several dozen youngsters, but some took part in the conversation
 baaki kyon chup rahe, kisi kii taraf se kyon mukhar nahin the, ye ges karnaa thik nahin hoga magar ise darj karnaa zaruri samajhataa hum
 a young man must have glowed that the army is being questioned
 congress ko nahin karnaa chahie
 But did the Congress question the army or the number of terrorists killed, which the BJP leaders did on their behalf
 aisi baarikiyaan charchaa se gaayab raheen
 Whoever it is, the young man who was speaking stood up from his seat
 kuch naujavaanon ne apni seat par baithe hue kaha ki sena ko lekar raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 Modi's decision was not alone
 vahaan to sab milakar faisla karte hai
 Therefore, it is not right for everyone to decide and take credit alone
 sab bolne ke baad ve yah bolnaa nahin bhuule ki sena ko lekar raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 Perhaps the same can be said in the atmosphere created by media or BJP organizations
 zaahir he in naujavaanon ke paas apane tarkon ko lekar itnaa aatmavishvaas nahin he ki apni baat kii daavedaari khulkar kar saken
 The girls met, even after encouraging them to speak, the result was zero
 yah bahut dukhad he
 i wish someone had changed it
 ek hi bol pain magar unhone wo apane anubhav auki raajnneetik samaj main fark nahin kar pai
 Even young boys could not do it
 us ladki ne kaha ki sarkari pariksha hoti he to paise dekar seat bik jaati he
 She was giving an example recently, but finally said that since the BJP has come, everything has been fine
 kya apni baat ko kehane ke baad bhaajapa ke liye kuch acha kahana zaruri he yaa yah unki swaabhaavik pasand he, iskaa antim uttar mere paas nahin he
 i was just reading the youth who is said to change these countries
 magar unhen thik se pataa he ki angrezi or ganit kii karaab samaj ne unhen kasbe ko badalane laayak nahin choda he
 i was talking to him at a coaching center in Khekra tehsil of Baghpat
 naujavaanon ko pataa he ki gramin or kasbaa kshetron main shiksha vyavastha thapp he
 Its quality is so poor that even after spending many years in school and college, they are still able to qualify for class IV
 in naujavaanon ne sarkari or skool college ghatiya hi dekhe hai
 Poor colleges remain in every phase and never change, these youngsters have been away from any hope of improvement in education
 unhone is jaankaree ko sweekaar kar nazarandaaz karnaa sikh liya he
 It is not that they did not try to fix it
 magar uskaa koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 It is, of course, deeply troubled by the question of employment
 ve samajhate hai ki chunavi saal main bhartiyon ain hai
 Otherwise, there was no vacancy for five years
 ab jab chunaav samaapt hoga tab phir bhartiyon aani band ho jaaengi
 But while narrating these questions, he did not show the same resentment that is expected in the issue of unemployment
 chunaav main ye kise vot denge, main isamen dilchaspee nahin rakhata
 Many youths did not openly say whom they would vote for
 magar bijepi ke samarthak ne kaha ki sara vot bhaajapa kaa he
 We are not voting for the candidate
 unase to dukhi hai
 He has counted many such shortcomings, which can be heard that they will not vote for BJP
 unhone sab bataaya ki aspataal main doctor nahin he
 One has to travel 30 km in an emergency
 padhai karaab he
 Roads are bad
 swatchta kaa bura haal he
 But all our vote will go to BJP
 yah noujvaan sakriy samarthak ho saktaa he, agar he tab bhi main dekhnaa chaah rahaa tha ki tamaam tarah ke sankaton kaa kisi matadaata par kya asar padataa he
 He does not know his mind, but based on what he said, it felt that there is no effect
 ek ne kaha ki desh zaruri he
 He will remain unemployed for two more years
 yah vahi noujvaan tha jo kah rahaa tha ki jab sabane mil kar pakistan par hamalaa karne kaa faisla kiya to phir modi akele shrey kyon le rahe hai
 In some places, some voters showed clarity about themselves
 ye wo log the jinhone panchayat, parshad, vidhayak or saansad ke chunaav main bhaajapa ko vot dene tak ummid rakhi ki unki zamin kaa muawza milegaa
 They say that the BJP people started the protest, initially their leaders came a lot
 unka pradarshan ab do saal se adhik kaa ho chukaa he
 From crawling on the ground to eating police sticks and being involved in several cases, they are now thinking of some other option
 bina puche kah rahe hai ki ham vot nahin karenge
 Despite being in government from Lucknow to Delhi, he did not get compensation nor did he come after winning the situation
 mahilaon ko police ne maaraa, isse bhi aahat hai
 How long is the process of becoming a citizen from a voter
 kai saal baad vah badalata he
 Changing means that he is able to see the toughness of the system
 kya inke anubhavon ke aadhaar par daawa kiya ja saktaa he ki kisaanon main naagarik chetana ai he? kya ve apane muddon ke prati itane eemaandaar hai ki kisi raajnneetik dal ke prati nishtha koi myne nahin rakhti he? meraa jawaab he nahin hai
 Political parties have repeatedly duped farmers
 ab ve thage jane or kuchle jane main fark nahin kar pate hai
 Political change does not come from defeating one party and bringing in another
 raajnneetik badlaav aata he raajnneetik chetana ke nirmaan main
 Has the opposition created any political consciousness, fought for it? Or people have created political consciousness at their level, in which media and opposition organizations have no role, then the answer will be found on 26 May
 abhi nahin kyonki janata bol nahin rahi he
 Is not telling matadaata ke banane kii prakriya ko agar dekhen to sab kuch matadaata ke nijee anubhavon par choda gaya he
 With the help of personal experiences, the information world has left them alone
 soochna sansar inke liye aise anubhavon ko gadhata he jo kai baar inke nijee anubhav par baari pad jate hai
 i don't like a voter being careless or talking lightly about votes
 uskaa halkaa hona hi loktantr kaa khokhla hona he
 Top US envoy Brett mcgurk has said that the Iraqi city of Mosul may have ended IS, but the fight against this terrorist organization will continue
 islamic state (aies) ke khilaaf antarrashtriya gathbandhan ke sheersh america doot brett macgark ne kaha, ‘abhi kaam puraa nahin hua he
 We have to move forward now
 isliye hamane aaj baithak kii he taaki agle charan ke liye ham apane prayaason ko samanvit kar saken
 He called the liberation of Mosul a major success against IS
 unhone kaha ki mosul main ek saal se chal rahaa abhiyaan pichley kuch dinon main samaapt hua
 He called the Mosul campaign the most difficult military operation since World War II
 tippaniyan He said that Raqqa and Syria are far more complex than Iraq
 haalanki vahaan kaa model kaaphi had tak samaan he
 mcgurk said much depends on political reconciliation
 syria main kareeb chaar saal main 40,000 videshi ladaakon kaa aana aies ke udai kaa mukhya kaaran tha
 The same thing happened in Iraq
 yahaan bhi badi sankhya main aatankwaadi, aatmghaatee hamalavar aae
 He said, 'if in any country such people from all over the world will come to blow themselves up in mosques, ice cream parlors, kill children, then whatever will happen was happening in Iraq
 ’ unhone kaha ki jab tak vishvabhar se is prakaar ke logon kaa aana jari rahegaa, tab tak raajnneetik pragati nahin ho sakati
 According to mcgurk, foreign fighters are no longer coming to Syria
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) unhone kaha ki rakka or syria iraq ke bajaae kahin zyada jatil he
 However the model there is largely the same
 macgark ne kaha ki raajnneetik sulah par kaaphi kuch nirbhar karata he
 The arrival of 40,000 foreign fighters in Syria in about four years was the main reason for the rise of IS
 isi tarah iraq main bhi aisa hi hua
 a large number of terrorist, suicide bombers also came here
 unhone kaha, ‘agar kisi bhi desh main vishwa bhar se is prakaar ke log khud ko masjidon, icecream parloron main udaane aaenge, bacchon kii hatya karne aaenge, to jo hoga, vahiin iraq main ho rahaa tha
 'he said that as long as such people continue to come from all over the world, there cannot be political progress
 macgark ke anusaar videshi ladaake ab syria main nahin aa rahe
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed

 Name of Courses: phd in Engineering Program, phd in Design Program, phd in Science Program, phd in Social Science Qualification: Master's Degree in related stream Last date to apply: April 11 deshbhar main jiesti lagu hone kii ulti ginati shuru ho chuki he
 Many traders in the country as well as the capital of the country seem to be in a dilemma
 jiesti bill ko samajhane va is par baatcheet karne ke liye dilli sarkaar ne siaiai (CII) ke saath milakar ek conference kaa aayojan kiya jahaan jiesti se jude muddon, samasyaon ko lekar charchaa hui
 More than 300 people from the industry attended this conference called by CII
 dilli ke upmukhyamantrimanish sisodiyaase is dauraan 'ajtak' se exclusive baatcheet kii or dilli sarkaar kijistiki taiyaariyon ke sawaal poochne par sisodiya ne kaha ki"dar lag rahaa he, jis tarah GSTN chairman kah rahe hai ki software testing kaa time nahin he
 If there is any deficiency due to this, then the entire country will have to bear the brunt of it
 up mukhyamantri ne kaha ki dilli ke logon ko dabl tex ke system main nahi daal saktaa ki GST or VAT ek saath lagegaa
 But GST is now a reality which the entire country will have to adopt
 "kai utpaadon par tex badhane ke baad vyapaariyon kii naaraazgi ke sawaal par sisodiya ne 'ajtak' ko bataaya kiwah 18% tex ko sahi nahin maanate or puure desh main 12% tex lagane kii kavayad karte hai
 Sisodia says that "the kind of preparation that is being done about GST is not good
 isliye hadtaal karne vaale vyapaariyon ke paksh main hoon
 When the poor man cannot arrange clothes and food grains for himself, how can the government tax the poor
 isliye tamaam badaye gaye tex ke khilaaf hoon
 Tax evasion will be due to high rate tax, in addition to this, if there is loss to the traders then it is a simple matter that the country will suffer loss ”
 siaiai ke dilli state ke chairman rahul choudhary kaa kahana he ki "jiesti lagu hone ke baad dhire-dhire tamaam adchane khatm ho jaaengi
 CII has given suggestions to the Delhi government, it will share them with the central government
 " chayarmen rahul choudhary ke mutabik jiesti lagu hone ke baad salanaa dedh karod rupye kaa turn over vaale vyapriyon ko koi ritern fil nahi kerani he
 In such a situation, traders who adopt GST in the beginning will get more benefit
 dilli CII chayaraman kaa maananaahai ki jiesti lagu hone ke baad inter state berrier hatane se vyapaaree ko 2% kaa benifit milegaa
 There is also a possibility of goods being cheaper

 The tenure will be nine years
 The committee wants to make it clear that the total tenure of an officer in cricket administration will be nine years, not 18 years as stated earlier
 samiti ne yah bhi spasht kiya ki teen varsh kaa kaarykaal puraa karne ke baad kisi adhikari ko teen varsh ke 'viraam' par janaa hi padegaa
 According to this rule, Sourav Ganguly, the president and former captain of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), considered the most strong candidate for the post of BCCI president, will have to spend a 'break' period before becoming the BCCI president

 ' Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan cut interest rates further by a quarter of a percent on June 2, but also underscored some of the dangers facing the economy, especially those arising out of the possibility of a weak monsoon
 unke bayaan kaa bazaar par pratikul asar padaa or share bazaar suchakank do dinon ke bheetar 1,000 se zyada ank gir gaya
 Rajan spoke openly to India Today Group Editor (business Television) Vivek Law about why the door to further cut interest rates is "not closed"
 ” unhone ummid jataai ki is baar sarkaar kamjor monsoon ke nateezon se nibatane ke liye behatar sthiti main he
 He also explained what would have to be done to fix the economic problems
 baatcheet ke kuch anshahapane haal hi main sarkaar se avastavik apekshaaon kii charchaa kii thi or uske liye “safed ghode par baithe ronaald reagan” ke jumale kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Does the same apply in the case of you and the Reserve Bank of India? See, expectations are in place
 maine lagaataar is par jor diya he ki hamaara kaam rupye ke mulya, mahangaai dar or vyapak aarthik sthirataa ke maamle main vishwaas kaa maahaul kaayam karnaa he, lekin aarthik vruddhi ke morche par hamaari koi bhoomika nahin he
 We can certainly help with some structural reforms, which is why we announced that we will be able to license small financial banks by the end of August, but the leadership on this front is ultimately for the private sector, the government sector, or the government itself
 We have to do it because it is their investment that increases the growth rate
 hamaara kaam maahaul bananaa he or ham tamaam ulajhanon ke bich bhi apane str par behatar maahaul banaate hai
 Although everyone sees it from their perspective
 udyogpati ise laagat kii drushti se dekhte hai
 They forget that there is another category of savers who worry that they may get more than the inflation rate on their deposits
 hamen donon ke bich santulan bananaa hota he
 People do not understand that the whole line is of balance
 kya rigerv bank ne vyapak maahaul banane main apni bhoomika adaa kii he? kya baaki maahaul ab apane aap taiyaar ho janaa chahie? aap sarkaar yaa nijee kshetra se kya karne kii ummid rakhte hai?ateet kii kuch samasyaayein hai jo hamen viraasat main mili hai
 As we deal with them, economic growth will accelerate
 mujhe lagata he ki yah prakriya jari he lekin abhi or kaam kiya janaa he
 Our work is not finished
 hamen kuchhek pariyojnaon ke liye rasta bananaa hoga jo ataki hui hai
 In this case, the responsibility lies with the government, private sector and banking sector
 kya aap in upayon ke baavjood vruddhi dar ko lekar niraash hai?mujhe lagata he ki kaaphi kaam chal rahaa he
 We have to work within a particular system
 yah tantra acha he
 The good thing is that our democracy is dynamic and it has systems of balance and control
 isi tantra ke bheetar hamen aage kii ore badhanaa he or uski ek tay chaal hoti he
 The second important thing is that as we grow into a developed economy, we will also need to build institutions
 usamen vakt lagata he or vaastavik apekshaaon kii darkaar hoti he
 We cannot make policies on the basis of choice, as has happened in the past
 masalan, mudrasphiti par kaabo karne kii disha main badhate hai to apane purvanumaan ke aadhaar par kadam badhaate hai, lekin is par lagaataar bahes jari rahati he ki aapako apane purvanumaanon ko chhodkar aarthik vruddhi par dhyaan dena chahie kyonki uski dar kamjor he
 But our job is also to control inflation
 isliye is disha main ham sabase zyada dhyaan dene kii koshish kar bhi rahe hai
 The market wanted to cut rates, you did the same
 purvanumaan bharosemand nahin dikhataa
 Will there be no further rate cut this year? i think it is a misunderstanding
 hamane to yahi kaha tha ki apane purvanumaan par bharosa karte hue ham is saal ke ant tak mudrasphiti ke apane lakshya ko hasil kar lenge
 There are many obstacles in this path
 hamane teen kii ore ishaara kiya tha
 One is the monsoon, but more important than that is the administrative response to the weak monsoon
 monsoon kamjor rahata he lekin aapke paas upyukt nitigat upaae hai, to isse bahut fark pad saktaa he
 We have included some technical estimates but if the response is very strong and the monsoon is stronger than the forecast, then there will be more policy scope for us to work
 isi tarah, tel kii keemten ek bada kaarak hai
 Meanwhile, she has grown rapidly
 ham maanate hai ki isaki keemat kaa ek adhiktam str he
 One assumption is that its supply in the market is excessive
 pehle bhi isi vajah se isaki keemat giri thi
 If this happens again, then we will get more scope
 yahi baat bahari maahaul ke saath lagu hoti he
 Meaning you are saying that the door is not closed yet? The door is not closed yet
 tel par aapaki raay kya he? keemton main oochaal kaa khatra kitna gambhir he?tel bazaar kaa buniyadi tathy yah he ki shell kaa utpaadan kaaphi badha he, shell main nivesh kam samay main kiye ja sakate hai
 If oil prices exceeded $ 70 per barrel, areas of shale exploration that were closed can be opened rapidly
 bazaar ke khilaadiyon se mujhe yahi rujhaan praapt ho rahe hai
 This means that its maximum price is $ 70 per barrel and we have taken this into consideration in our estimates as well
 philhal koi pravaah nahin he
 If the flow remains high and the global economy remains weak, then it could have an impact on oil prices
 isamen giravat bhi dekhi ja sakati he
 What we do not know is geopolitical danger
 kya pataa, iageies ke chalate iraq yaa libya main kya hone vaala he
 You have reduced the interest rates, but the real question is whether it reaches the consumers or not
 kya us morche par kuch badla he?iskaa laabh dhire-dhire mil rahaa he
 We are seeing a drop in interest rates
 bank bhi aisa hi kar rahe hai
 If the competition in the market increases with time, then it will also get benefits
 ham darasal yah pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki aisa karne main kya hamaari nitiyaan kisi tareeke se kisi bank kii kshamta ko baadhit to nahin kar rahi hai, jisamen aadhaar daron kii niti bhi shaamil he
 i hope we can move towards a more market based scale over time
 pehle ham marginal laagat mulya kii ore badhen, phir bazaar kii benchmark dar kii ore or aakhirkaar is dhandhe se hi baahar nikal jaaen ki bainkon ko unki daren tay karne ke liye bataanaa he
 Banks should allow rates to be determined on the basis of competition
 yah to bada sudhaar he
 What is your plan for this? i think we will be able to do so by the end of January
 is vitt varsh ke ant tak ham sabhi bainkon ko seemaant laagat mulya tak laa paaenge
 Right now we are talking to them about this and trying to know their needs
 jab benchmark tay ho jaae, jab benchmark company gathit ho jaae, tab ham unhen benchmark tak aane ko kah paaenge
 What is your vision for India's real status in the world economy? In the short term, we are doing what we should be doing: fixing inherited problems that were coming in the way of faster rate of economic growth
 ye samasyaayein khud vikaas se paidaa ho rahi hai
 Look at the entire debate on land acquisition
 jameen un sudur ilaakon main adhigrahit kii jaani he jahaan adhiktar aabaadi adivasee he or uske paas apane adhikaron kii raksha karne kaa samarthy nahin he, isiilie ham is masale par itnaa aage-peeche kar rahe hai
 Sometimes we are giving them forest rights, sometimes we are giving the rights of tribals and then we are finding that we have to open mines there while respecting these rights
 sawaal yah he ki is kaam ko kaayade se kaise kiya jaae? yah loktantric samaaj main manthan kii tarah he
 We are trying to deal with these problems
 bharat kaa audyogkikaran kaise hoga? rojgaar srijan ke liye, utpaadan kshetra ko durust karne ke liye hamen kya karnaa hoga?hamaari sabase badi takat yah he ki hamaare yahaan tamaam kism ke udhyami maujuud hai&yuva, bujurg, takanic pravan or takanic rahit, vagairah
 We have to create a positive environment for them, which means infrastructure, that is, we will need to enhance the quality of human capital
 aaj skool main to har koi he lekin use zyada seekhney kii darkaar he
 For a good factory job, they have to come forward enough from high school level teaching
 yani rojgaar paane kii unki kshamta ko badhaayaa janaa he
 We need to work on regularizing the business
 hamen tamaam galat niyamon se chhutkaaraa paanaa hoga jabaki aise upyukt dhaanche taiyaar karne honge jahaan hamaara niyaman aaj bhi bahut kharaab he
 For example, how can it be possible that despite the rules, sewer water still flows in the Ganges? We have to implement more vigilant and strict rules
 aakhri aayam vitt kaa he
 We are emphasizing on how to make finance more available in the whole country so that every region can use it to grow
 iske alaava or zyada sakriy banking tantra kii bhi aavashyaktaa he taaki is kshetra main viraasat main mili samasyaon ko dur kiya ja sake, sarkari bainkon main rajkaaj ko sudhara ja sake
 These are the issues holding us back
 sawaal yah he ki jo sankat main hai unhen kaise thik kiya jaae
 As a former minister said, our entrepreneurs are not sick, even if companies are sick
 hamen aise muddon se nipatane kii jarurat he
 The Prime Minister says that you are a good teacher
 samasyaayein dur karne ke liye sarkaar ko aap kya suzav dena chahenge
 i think the government knows what the problems are and it is working on it as well
 mujhe lagata he ki rukii hui pariyojnaayen ahm hai
 This is the first time that we are generating a lot of electricity but it is not able to reach the consumers because the power distribution companies cannot pay its cost
 isiilie kuch vitarak companiyon kaa punargathan kiya gaya he
 We will have to see if it is working as per the requirement
 jinka punargathan nahin kiya gaya, unke bare main ham kya karen, yah bhi dekhnaa hoga
 It is also necessary to correct the balance sheet of the banks so that as the demand for loans increases, banks can feel comfortable in the path of growth
 vaishvik paristhiti ko aap kaise dekhte hai-masalan, greece, america fedral rigerv kaa byaaj daren badhanaa?greece ke bare main to kisi ko nahin maaloom
 It is difficult to talk about
 mujhe lagata he ki is maamle main donon pakshon se sahanubhuti rakhi ja sakati he
 i would hope that its direction should not be such that it will prove to harm the European financial system
 mujhe nahin lagata ki koi bhi is bare main kuch kehane kii sthiti main hoga ki ve kisi samjhaute tak aa bhi paaenge yaa nahin
 As far as America is concerned, its first quarter has been bad and then there is talk of avoiding monetary tightening
 kya aapako bharat se puunji ke baahar jane kaa khatra lagata he?iskaa jawaab haa main bhi he or naa main bhi
 When we look at the capital of foreign institutional investors (fiis) in equities, we find that it has been much more stable than debt flows
 main maanata hum ki jab tak kuch buniyadi badlaav nahin hote, log asthirataa ke shuruaati jatke ke baad upyukt faisle lenge
 That is why i am not too worried that the decision taken in America will collapse our markets
 hamaare bazaar kii pratikriya bhi kisi duusare bazaar ke jaisi hi rahegi lekin mujhe nahin lagata ki shuruaati jhatkon ke baad niveshak isse dur rahenge
 If our foundation is strong, they will return
 isiilie main kahata hum ki satat vruddhi ke liye apni buniyaad ko majboot karo
 How has your journey been from a financial prophet to RBI governor? It seems that you were aiming to become Prime Minister during school days? i meant to say that i think my goals after school have become more practical
 mujhe lagata he ki is tarah ke kaam main kaaphi santushti he
 Even as a professor or the Chief Economist of the International Monetary Fund, you are basically just a consultant and people can ignore what you said and it is the same
 lekin yahaan kuch vajahon se log vaisaa karte hai, jaisaa aap unhen kehete hai
 Central banks have always made the mistake that they have promised more than they can
 kendriya bank sirf itnaa hi kar saktaa he ki vah dhaancha taiyaar kar saktaa he, apane aap main vruddhi nahin paidaa kar saktaa
 The increase has to come from elsewhere
 logon ko ham yahi bataane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 With the coming of the Lok Sabha elections, the era of political promises and proclamations has also started

 isisi cricket world cap ke aagaaj main ek hafte se bhi kam kaa vakt bachaa he
 In such a situation, every team is trying to finalize their playing eleven
 bhartiya cricket team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni to is kavayad main england or australia ke khilaaf tri siries se hi jute gaye the
 But the problem is that the questions with which Dhoni goes into the match, the answers to the questions are far ahead of the team
 WC: abhyaas match main bhi haari team indiatim india kaa batting line ap kya ho? gendbaaji kram kya ho? kitne oleroundaron ko team main jagah di jaae? chaar niyamit gendbaaj ke saath utren yaa phir teen? slog overon main gendbaaji koun karegaa? aise hi kai sawaal hai jinke jawaab ab tak milte hue nahin dikh rahe
 Maxwell scored 55 runs in 15 balls, it is that Team India's performance is getting worse match by match
 ravivaar ko ek abhyaas match main bharat ko 106 ranon se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Against Australia, Team India bowled 372 runs before bowling first and only 45 in reply
 1 overon main 265 ran banaakar out ho gai
 Now, questions are being raised in the minds of fans that whether this team will be able to defend their title in a respectable manner or not
 cricket ke kai jaankaar maujuuda team ko quarter final se aage jate hue nahin dekh rahe hai
 But all this is later philhal najar daalate hai un sawaalon par jinke jawaab dhoni dhund rahe hai
 1
 kin gendbaajon ko chune?team india pichley 45 dinon se zyada vakt se australia main he par gendbaajon ko dekhakar aisa bilkul nahin lagata
 There is not a bowler who is to be trusted to get a wicket
 mohammad shami, bhubaneshwar kumaar, umesh yadav, aar aswin or mohit sharma kuch pal ke liye spark dikhaate hai par dabaav main aate hi puri tarah se bikhar jate hai
 Alam is that if India batting first then the bowlers are unable to defend any score and in case of bowling first, then the opponents are looking to score more than 300 runs
 eshanth sharma ke chotil hone se dhoni kii samasya or badi he
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar is not fully fit, with his bowling not showing the edge that the team management would expect
 mohammad shami ne sabase zyada niraash kiya he, test siries ke ghatiya pradarshan kaa asar ab unke vanade parformens bhi dikh rahaa he
 Ashwin's spin does not seem to be sharpening due to not getting much help from the pitch
 kuch aisa hi haal rabindra jadeja or akshar patel kaa bhi he
 Both are unable to take wickets and neither stop runs
 kuch maichon main binni ne nai gend se gendbaaji kii shuruuaat kii, unhen kuch wicket to mili hai par pes kii kami vipakshi ballebaajon ke paksh main jaati he
 2
 ballebaaji ko lekar chintatim india kaa pradarshan ab puri tarah se ballebaaji par nirbhar he
 But the way the team has also failed to play regular 50 overs in some matches, it has increased the tension of Dhoni
 shikhar dhawan ne gaba test main aakhri baar ardhashatak jadaa tha
 After that, he was dismissed cheaply in every match
 rohit sharma form main to hai, par fitness sawaalon ke ghere main he
 After a tremendous performance in the Test series, Virat Kohli's bat has been silent in odis so far
 nichle madhyakram ballebaaji kii jaan maane jane vaale mahendra singh dhoni or suresh raina puri tarah se out of form hai
 3
 kya hoga gendbaaji combination?dhoni kin gendbaajon par bharosa jataayenge
 This is a very important question
 philhal tej gendbaaj ke taur par umesh yadav, bhubaneshwar kumaar or mohit sharma kaa plaing ilevan main shaamil kiya janaa tay dikh rahaa he
 At the same time, the responsibility of spin will be on the shoulders of r Ashwin and Stuart Binny is expected to play as an all-rounder
 is combination ke saath dikkat yah he ki nichle kram main ballebaaji thodi kamjor ho jaati he
 Some experts say that the strength of Team India is spin bowling, so in every match, two spinners should be included in the playing eleven
 khaskar rabindra jadeja plaing ilevan kaa hissaa rahen, ve ballebaaji or kshetrarakshan bhi main yogadan de sakate hai
 4
 opening or madhyakram ko lekar kanfujanshikhar dhawan kaa kharaab form
 Rohit Sharma's fitness
 rahane ke pradarshan main nirantarata kii kami
 Opening batting has become a sore throat of Team India
 dhoni ke tay kar paanaa mushkil ho gaya he ki kis par bharosa jataayaa jaae
 However, by getting Dhawan and Rohit Sharma to open in the practice match, Dhoni has pointed to solve this puzzle to some extent
 kohli kahaan par ballebaaji karen, tisare yaa chauthe number par
 There is doubt about this
 kabhi ambati raidu to kabhi ajinkya rahane, team management baar-baar prayog kar rahaa he, par kuch bhi thos nahin niklaa he ab tak
 Dhoni has been repeatedly complaining that the team lacked depth in batting
 aise main vah 7 ballebaaj or chaar gendbaaj ke saath maidan par utarane kaa jokhim uthaaenge
 By the time India became independent, Hindi cinema had grown a lot
 cinemagharon main puure utsaah ke saath filmein dekhi jaati thim
 In such a situation, it is also interesting to know that when the whole country was immersed in the celebration of independence on 15 August 1947, which Hindi film was released on that day
 kabhi relies nahin ho saki jepi datta kii ye film, 9 saal kiya intjaaritefaq se bharat kii aazaadee ke din shuukravaar tha or jo film relies hui uskaa naam tha shehanai
 The film was directed by PL Santoshi and starred in Kishore Kumar, Indumati, Radhakrishnan and Rehana
 iskaa mujeec si ramchandra ne diya tha
 Shehnai was among the top five highest grossing films of the year 1947
 film kaa vigyaapan bhi us samay ke pramukh akhabaaron main diya gaya tha
 This was a feature story
 film main 9 gane the
 This film was made by Manoj Kumar at the behest of the PM, even today there is a mention of another film released on the day of Hit Azadi
 ye film he meraa geet
 It featured Sushil Kumar and Naseem Jr in the lead roles
 lekin is film ke bare main adhik vistaar se jaankaree nahin milti he

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called a meeting of all Union Ministers on 27 January
 ise cabinet pherbadal se pehle kii kavayad mana ja rahaa he
 It is believed that this reshuffle is being done to prepare for the UP elections
 isamen upi ke kuch saansadon ko mantri pad diya ja saktaa he
 This change will happen this month, the English newspaper Asian Age has written to sources that there will be no reshuffle in the Home, Defense, Finance and Foreign Ministries
 urja sahit duusare mantralayon main pherbadal kiya ja saktaa he
 Sources said that this cabinet expansion or reshuffle will be done after January 27 within the same month
 kise mil saktaa he mantri paddsam main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 This time the BJP is dreaming of forming a government there
 ise dekhte hue assam se saansad raman deka ko cabinet main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 He is the second time MP from Mangaldoi seat in Assam
 vah 2006 main assam bijepi adhyaksh bhi rah chuke hai
 At the same time, former CM Sushil Kumaramodi from Bihar can be brought to the cabinet through Rajya Sabha
 jetali or parrikar bhi badalenge!vahiin, duusari media reports ke mutabik raksha or vitt mantralay main bhi badlaav ho saktaa he
 Arun Jaitley may become the defense minister again
 vahiin, piyush goyal pramot hokar vitt mantri banaae ja sakate hai
 Jaitley is currently the finance minister, while defense is on Manohar Parrikar
 goyal ke paas power or kol ministry hai
 Earlier, both the finance and defense ministries were with Jaitley
 november 2014 main parrikar ko goa se laayaa gaya tha
 It is not clear what responsibility will be given to Parrikar
 yah badlaav kyon?upi or assam main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 In view of these, the objective of increasing the representation of both the states
 bihar vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi kii haar ke baad amit shah or piem modi kii jodi par dabaav bhi he
 It is also being said that the Union is under pressure that ministers who are unable to deliver the output should be removed
 pashchim bengal main bhi chunaav hone hai, lihaaja centre sarkaar kii chhavi badalanaa sangh kii pehali praathamikta he
 What will happen to the visiting ministers? The going ministers can be included in the new team of BJP President Amit Shah
 shah kaa bhi agle teen saal ke liye adhyaksh bane rahanaa takreeban tay he
 The meeting of ministers on January 27 is the second in the last one month
 pehali baithak 17 disambar ko hui thi
 So far, Badlavarendra Modi and his cabinet were sworn in only once on 26 May 2014
 uske baad unki cabinet main sirf ek baar november, 2014 main badlaav hua tha
 During the same change, Manohar Parrikar was brought to the center and entrusted with the responsibility
 parrikar ke alaava tab bade chehron main shivasena ke suresh prabhu bhi shaamil the, jinhen rail mantralay kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya tha
 Sadanand Gowda was the Railway Minister till 9 November 2014
 chaudaa maheene biit gaye, tab se modi kii cabinet main koi badlaav nahin hua he
 Senior officials of the Obama administration have said that the US would be ready to work with its prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi when the BJP comes to power in the next general elections in India
 adhikariyon ne saath hi kaha ki chunaav ke nateezon se alag donon deshon ke majboot dwipaksheeya sambandh jari rahenge

 On the condition of anonymity, the official said, "the visa case is a matter of media
" unhen (modi ko) aavedan karnaa he or hamen samiksha kerani he
 He (has not applied for a visa)
 adhikari se poocha gaya, aap kehete hai pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke saath america ke majboot sambandh hai
 If Modi becomes Prime Minister next year, will it not be a problem for America? In response to this, the official said, i think the US also had very strong relations with the previous government, which was formed under the leadership of BJP
 america adhikari ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki america or bharat ke bich bahut majboot sambandh hai, america main dwidaleey vyavastha he, chaahe koi bhi satta main ho, aisa hi rahata he
 We feel that all political parties are supported in India's multi-party system and in this system we can expect these relations to continue
 ek anya america adhikari ke anusaar, unke desh kii sarkaar main modi ko lekar bahut adhik chintaaen nahin hai, lekin aisa samajha jaataa he ki prashasan ne is maamle main yathasthiti banaae rakhane kaa faisla kiya he, kyonki ise bharat kii andruni raajnneeti main hastekshep ke taur par dekha ja saktaa he
 According to sources, if there is any change in the status quo, political parties can politicize the issue before the election

 Shastri clarified that the yo-yo test would continue and Kohli also said that it should be seen as a 'tough decision' rather than being emotional, which would only benefit the team

 Therefore we emphasize the yo-yo test
 agar kisi ko lagata he ki yah bahut zyada gambhir nahin he, to yah unki bhul he
 He can go
 ’the yo-yo Test is here to stay
 If you pass, you play
 The captain is leading from the front

 chaar saal pehle iraq ke mosul shahar main bagdadi ke aatankiyon ke haathon maare gaye 39 bharatiyon ke avshesh april ke pehle hafte main bharat laae jane kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he
 Minister of State for External Affairs General VK Singh is going to Baghdad on April 1 after getting the necessary approval
 sabhi 39 bharatiyon ke avshesh philhal, baghdad ke forensik department main rakhe gaye hai
 According to reports, after completing the necessary legal procedures with the Iraqi government, the remains of all 39 Indians will be brought to India by a special aircraft next week
 2014: mosul main maujuud the hajaaron bhartiyairaq kaa uttari shahar mosul tab tak shant tha
 Baghdadi and the ISS had not yet caught sight of the city
 haalanki iraq ke baaki ilaakon par dhire-dhire iesas kaa shikanja kasata ja rahaa tha
 But no one expected that Baghdadi could enter Mosul as well
 kyonki tel ke kuen kii vajah se yahaan kii suraksha vyavastha kaaphi kadi thi
 The city was quiet, so large scale construction work was also going on in Mosul
 us vakt yani 2014 main kareeb das hajaar bhartiya iraq main rah rahe the
 a large number of them belonged to laborers
 inhen main se bahut se majdoor mosul kii ek privet construction company main kaam kar rahe the
 June 2014: ISIS had captured Mosul
 Suddenly ISIS militants storm Mosul in the first week of June, passing through several small towns in northern Iraq
 darasal, bagdadi ko apni ladaai jari rakhane ke liye paise kii jarurat thi
 And by capturing Mosul, he wanted to capture the oil reserves
 isiilie mosul par kabje ke liye usne apni puri takat jhonk di thi
 And finally, after a few days of fighting, the whole of Mosul is captured by Baghdadi
 construction company ke quarter main the 40 bhartiyamosul main aies ke dhaava bolte hi vahaan kaam kar rahe zyaadaatar videshi majdoor or karmchaaree jaan bachaa kar bhaag nikalate hai
 But many are stuck there
 inamen zyaadaatar bharat or bangladesh ke majdoor the
 In the third week of June 2014, IS militants reach a place in the Badush area near Mosul where 40 Indian laborers were living in the construction company's quarters
 unke saath kareeb 55 bangladeshi majdoor bhi vahaan maujuud the
 The Bangladeshi had escaped with the laborers, the owner of the Harjitak Construction Company was an Iraqi
 usne baad main bataaya ki bagdadi ke log tamaam mazdooron ko apane saath bandhakar bana kar vahaan se kisi anjaan par le gaye
 After this, he never got any information about them
 par iraqi adhikariyon ke mutabik bandhak banane ke baad un sabhi logon ko badoosh ke hi ilaake main le jaaya gaya tha
 Then a few days later 55 Bangladeshi laborers were separated and released
 bandhak banaae gaye 40 bhartiya mazdooron main se ek harjit messiah bhi un bangladeshi mazdooron ke saath reeha ho gaya tha
 Actually, he did not reveal his real name to IS militants
 lihaaja use bhi bangladeshi samaj kar aatankwaadiyon ne azaad kar diya
 The government did not believe in the claim of Christ
 After being kidnapped by ISIS, in June 2014, somehow, a laborer called Punjab to his house and reported to be held hostage by Baghdadi
 uske baad phir kabhi uskaa phone nahin aayaa or naa hi iske baad baaki bache 39 bhartiya mazdooron kii hi kabhi koi khabar ai
 However, upon release, Harjeet Christ approached External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, claiming that the 39 Indian laborers held hostage with him were gunned down by the people of Baghdadi in front of his eyes
 magar bharat sarkaar kaa kahana tha ki messiah kuch baaten jhooth bol rahaa tha isliye uske daawey par yakeen nahin kiya gaya
 The slaughter took place on the hill of Badush, time passed and no news of Indian workers was found
 yahaan tak ki teen-teen baar videsh rajya mantri general wike singh iraq bhi gaye
 On the other hand, by the end of the year 2017, Mosul was once again freed from Baghdadi's hands
 iraqi forcej ab mosul par waapas kabja kar chuki thi
 The search for the missing Indians had now reached inside Mosul
 isi bich ek rose bagdadi ke khauf se ubar chuke badoosh ke sthaneey logon ne bataaya ki badoosh ke kareeb hi ek pahari par bagdadi ke aantkiyon ne qatari main khadaa kar bahut se logon ko goli mari thi or phir un sabhi ko usee pahari par dafna diya tha
 Baghdadi had completely ruined Mosul during the three-year rule of the death of such uncovered Indians
 hajaaron log maare gaye the
 Collective cemeteries were being found everywhere
 jinamein saikadon laashen dafan thim
 Now finding the dead bodies of 39 Indians from all of them was an extremely difficult task after three years
 lekin iraqi sarkari ke prayaas or takanic ke sahare pataa chalaa ki badoosh kii pahari par kai laashe dafn he
 When excavated, 39 corpses were recovered from it, which had now become completely skeletal
 vahaan se kuch lambey bal or haath ke kade bhi mili
 Due to which the suspicion of the Government of India was strengthened
 kyonki gum hue bhartiya bhi 39 the or vahaan se mili kankal bhi
 The process of DNA testing started and within three months, all the dnas matched the DNA of the missing Indians
 is tarah se khulaasa hua ki un sabhi ko teen saal pehle hi katl kar diya gaya tha
 Now just their skeletons are being brought to India

 —with Kumar Anshuman umr koi bhi ho safed baalo kii samasya se aajkal zyaadaatar log pareshaan hai
 Previously, after a certain age, the hair of people was white, while now the hair of the children is also becoming white
 kam umr main baalo ke safed hone kaa kaaran aksar genetics ko samajha jaataa he
 But there can be many other reasons behind the hair becoming white
 aaie bataate hai aakhir kam umr main hi logon ke bal safed kyon ho jate hai-1
 Pollution - Air pollution also causes great damage to hair
 hawa main maujuud pradooshit tatv baalo ko damege karne ke saath unhen teji se safed karne lagate hai
 According to experts, free radicals present in polluted air damage the hair by damaging melanin
 2
 Stress - Stress is also one of the reasons why hair becomes white before age
 tanaav lene se bal jaldi apana natural rang kho dete hai
 If you want to prevent your hair from becoming white, then stay away from stress
 3
 Smoking is also a reason for hair becoming white at an early age
 saal 2013 main prakashit ek study ke mutabik, jo log dhumrapaan karte hai, unke bal jaldi safed hone kii sambhaavna duusare logon ke mukaable 25 fisadi zyada hoti he
 Apart from this, smoking habits severely damage health
 4
 Hormone- Hair also turns white quickly due to deteriorating hormone levels in the body
 hormones ke asantulit hone se bal ruukhe-sookhe ho jate hai
 The hair ends its shine
 saath hi baalo ke jhadane kii samasya bhi aam ho jaati he
 5
 anheldi diet-diet kaa sidhaa asar sehat par padataa he
 Therefore, it is very important to take special care of the diet
 darasal, diet main nutrients kii kami hone se kam umr main hi bal safed ho jate hai
 At the same time, due to lack of Vitamin B-12 in the body, hair starts becoming dry and dry and lifeless and loses its natural color
 prabhas or shraddha kapur starer film saaho darshakon or critics ko kuch khaas prabhavit nahin kar pai
 However, its film is doing good business at the box office
 film kaa jabardast pramotion or marketing mekars ke kaam aa rahi he or kam se kam film kii tikaten bik rahi hai
 However, the question still remains that how will the budget makers get out of such a huge film made with a budget of Rs 350 crore? Spotboye has published a conversation with the producers of UV Creations in one of its reports
 report ke mutabik jab produsar shyaam se poocha gaya ki 150 karod ke bajet main banane ja rahi saaho jab banani shuru hui to iskaa bajet 350 karod ja pahunchaa
 Now what plans do the makers have to withdraw this money? So Shyam looked at this question with shock
 unhone kaha, "ye sirf kayaas bhar he
 You people first came out with the figure of 150 crores and then said that the film is being made for 350 crores
 " tab produsar sahab ko yaad dilaayaa gaya ki film ke lead actor prabhas khud kai intervyuuj main ye baat kah chuke hai ki film kaa bajet 350 karod rupee he
 To this, producer Shyam said, "then i think the makers will have some planning as to how the money will be withdrawn
 "maaloom ho ki saaho main lambii chaudee star cast bhari gai jabaki film main kai seens ke liye itane bade kalakaaron kii jarurat nahin thi

 Pradeep Srivastava's home loan in Indirapuram of Ghaziabad ended this year

 That is, after homelone, no taxpayer needs to invest in any other item of 80C to save tax

 If a taxpayer is living in the house himself, then he will get a tax benefit of maximum 2 lakh rupees on the interest of the home loan, but if not living in that house, then the entire interest paid on the home loan is tax-free under section 24 (b) Will happen
 byaaj ke rup main adaa kii gai raashi par tex benefit kii koi seemaa nahin he
 This is also an advantage, if a person has bought a house by taking a joint loan and is a joint owner of the house, then both taxpayers will benefit from the tax benefit
 udhaaharan se samajhie maan lijie home lone ke mooldhan par kisi karadaata ko 1
 a benefit of Rs 5 lakh and interest is Rs 2 lakh and this benefit will be Rs 7 lakh in the joint benefit

 Former New Zealand cricketer Brendon mccullum is known for his batting batting, meanwhile, his fielding in the Big Bash League, released in Australia, has been recorded in the history of cricket
 ravivaar ko sidney cricket ground main brisben hit ke khilaaf vah log on main tainaat the, tabhi ek shandaar shot maari gai jo hawa main udate hue boundry ke baahar ja rahi thi lekin brendan makkulam ne jis shandaar tareeke se use rokane kii koshish kii vah kaabil-e-tarif thi
 Although he could not take the catch, but he definitely saved the run
 makkulam kii ye filding is match kaa sabase yaadgaar palon main shaamil ho gaya
 mccullum did this in the 16th over when James Vince, playing for the Sydney Sixers, was on 75 from 46 balls and tried to hit a six over the log
 No catch but how did Brendon mccullum stop this from going for a boundary!? # BBL08 | @bkttirespic
 twitter
 com / bzagw88nq7makkulam ne lagbhag kaich le liya tha lekin boundry se baahar jane se pehle unhone ball ko hawa main oochaal diya
 But after that he could not maintain the balance and could not catch the ball again
 jis samay unhone pehali baar ball ko kaich liya tha unke sharir kaa koi bhi hissaa boundry line se nahin chuaa tha
 However, a debate on this has also started on Twitter
 cricket main pehle ke niyam ke mutabik is shot ko boundry ke baahar qaraar de diya jaataa lekin ab cricket kaa niyam badal gaya he
 According to the new rule issued from 2013, the fielder must first stop the ball inside the boundary, if he has to stop the ball in the air, he will have to release the ball inside the boundary
 kyonki makkulam ne pehle uchhalkar kaich ko pakadaa, phir boundry se baahar jane ke pehle gend ko chhod diya or duusari baar phir vah boundry ke paas hi dobaar ball ko pakad kar andar phenk diya
 Should be changed to a 6 under Law 19

 He jumped from outside the rope and made contact with the ball before the ground

 The child was ill and we were taking him to a nearby hospital
 vahaan ek ladke ne apni bike se meri bike ko takkar maar kar gira diya

 On behalf of the Election Commission, Senior Advocate Meenakshi Arora told the court that unless the Principal Secretary of the Secretariat of the concerned legislature declared the seat vacant, the Commission could not initiate the election
 sunwaayee ke dauraan adaalat kii peeth ne poocha ki kisi janpratinidhi ko doshi qaraar dene kaa aadesh adaalat sidhe nirvachan ayog ko kyon nahin bhej detii taaki ayog aglaa kadam uthaa sake
 However, Arora said that only parliamentary secretariat or legislature can declare a seat vacant under procedural rules
 tippaniyan The court has issued this notice to the central government on the plea of an NGO 'lok Prahari', in which the organization has challenged the rule under which the Election Commission's commission starts only when the secretariat declares the seat vacant

 The title track features a glimpse of the love story of Salman Khan and Princess Sonam Kapoor, who became Prince in the film
 salmaan khaanne is gane ko apane phans ke saath twitor par bhi share kiya he
 He has written by tweeting, everyone should get Prem Ratan

 co / llnk1sgx85— Salman Khan (@beingsalmankhan)october 14, 2015gane ke mujeec ke alaava royak luk bhi khaas he
 Sooraj Barjatyaki is seen competing with Sanjay Leela Bhansali, who is famous for the Royal sets of Bollywood songs of this film
 gane main do shahi pariwaron kii shaano shohakat bhi dikhaai gai he
 In this song, it is also fun to express love for each other in Sonam and Salmanaka royal style
 is gane ke bol hai'prem ratan dhan payo',jise aawaaj di he palak muchhal ne or ise sangeet diya he himesh reshmia ne
 Apart from this, Irshad Kamil has written this song
 diwali par relies hone ja rahi is film main salmaan khan dabl role main apane maasoom or dabang donon adanj main darshakon ko anterten karte najar aaenge
 Watch the title track of the film 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo': amuman lalu prasad yadav jaisaa gathjod kii raajnneeti main rachaa-paga ghaagh netaa shaayad hi baaji apane haath se jane detaa he
 Then, the alliances become stronger when the alliance is in their home state, where they have ruled for nearly 15 years
 aadhe vakt ve khud mukhyamantri rahe to agali aadhi avadhi patni rabari devi ke mukhyamantri hone ke naate parade ke peeche se bagdor sanbhale rahe
 But as Bihar is coming out in the assembly elections, the bets of Chatur Lalu seem to be missing
 unhone shaayad yah sochaa tha ki pichley saal loksabhaa chunaavon main buree tarah post hue mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par ve baari padenge
 Therefore, his party RJD rejected 145 of the total 243 seats in the state
 lalu khud jedy (you) ke “sushasan” model kii aalochana kar chuke hai or unke samarthak bataa chuke hai ki nitish mukhyamantri pad ke sabase achche ummidavaar nahin hai
 But Nitish was so adamant that RJD chief had not even imagined it
 ve nai dilli main janata parivaar ke vilay ko pukhta karne ke liye bulaai gai lalu or mulaayam singh yadav kii 22 may baithak main nahin pahunche or 30 may ko patna main lalu ke saath saajha jansabha main bhi nahin gaye
 Then State JD (U) President Basistha Narayan Singh declared that the merger was going on
 nitish ne 7 june ko apane pattey khole
 He met Rahul Gandhi and the Congress vice-president indicated that the Congress would prefer to bet on Nitish in lieu of the scandal-tainted Lalu
 isse lalu ke armaan dhoomil ho gaye
 Lalu almost surrendered after seeing the crisis on his political existence due to lack of alliances with the Congress
 agle 24 ghante main unhone nitish ke netritv ko sweekaar kar liya or kabool kiya ki ve bijepi ko haraane ke liye yah “jehar bhi pine” ko taiyaar hai
 Though the Congress has only five mlas in the state, it is believed that it has the support of 17 percent Muslims here
 asal main 68 varsh kii umr main, chaara ghotaale main doshi qaraar lalu apane bacchon ko raajnneeti main sthapit karne kii khwaahish to rakhte hai par unamem jod-tod kaa vah madda nahin rah gaya he
 Again, contesting alone could not be an option
 pehle daur main beshak nitish baari pade hai par abhi to baaji shuru hui he
 Now the challenge of sharing seats with Lalu's consent in front of Nitish is not easy
 iske liye lalu or nitish ne chah sadasyon kii samiti banane kaa faisla kiya he
 There is no doubt that every seat will be pulled to the end
 jedy(you) 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main jiti 115 siton ko bantwaare kaa aadhaar bananaa chahta he, jinhen usne endie main rahete jeeta tha
 So RJD wants to base the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in which it had an edge in 145 assembly segments
 aise main 100-100 siten argedy or jedy(you) ke alaava 43 siten congress or ensipi ko dene ke liye nitish ko apane kuch vidhayakon kaa tikat kaatna pad saktaa he
 This can lead to rebellion bubbles not only in JD (U) but also in RJD
 nitish kii duusari chunauti lalu ke paramparaagat yadav vot bank ko jedy(you) ke paale main laane kii he
 The Yadavs are the largest caste group in the state with 14 per cent of the population
 par yadav ekamusth jedy(you) kii ore nahin ja sakate or yah baat lalu se behatar koi nahin jaanata
 He could not convert this vote bank to Ram Vilas Paswan
 donon 2009 ke loksabhaa or 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main ek saath lade the
 An even bigger question is whether Lalu will be able to gather with full power to reinstate Nitish in the Chief Minister's residence? Says a senior minister in the Nitish government, "the biggest difficulty for Nitish will prove to be his dependence on Lalu
 jinhone unke netritv ko sweekaar karnaa jehar gatakane jaisaa bataaya, unase bhala kya ummid?” congress ne bhi nitish ko chatur lalu kii chaal main na funsane kii salaah di he
 But the relief for Nitish is that his party is constantly standing with him amidst the electoral turmoil
 us vakt bhi jab unhone jeethanram maanjhi ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaakar dalit voton ko khone kaa jokhim mol liya or ab bade vot bank par daawa karne vaale lalu ko chunauti di he
 It is a matter of relief for Nitish that Lalu's problems are not less
 lalu kareeb dashak bhar se chunavi haar se ubarne ke liye is baar apni party ke behatar pradarshan kii khatir utaavle hai
 RJD last performed better in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections
 ab lalu apni viraasat apane beton ko saunpna chaahate hai or unki beti misa bharti or bete tejasvi tathaa tej pratap is baar vidhansabha chunaav lard sakate hai
 In such a situation, Lalu needs Nitish as much as Nitish
 haalanki nitish ke liye abhi baaji shuru hi hui he lekin agar janata parivaar gathbandhan seat bantwaare kii jang paar karke chunaav jeet bhi jaataa he to nitish kii agali chunauti satta kii saajhedaari hogi
 Writer, director and actor Neeraj Vora's death caused a huge loss to his family and Bollywood as he was a master of multi talent
 unki maut se kisi or ko bhi afsos ke saath-saath bada jhatka laga he or wo hai model se kalakaar bani roselin khan
 After Neeraj Vora's death, his dream of making a mark in Bollywood, along with the setback, once again broke
 darasal niraj vora ne ek film 'bhabhi online' ke liye roselin khan ko sin kiya tha
 Roslyn was hopeful that this film would give her a good chance to make a name in Bollywood, but it did not happen and Neeraj said goodbye to the world before the film started
 tippaniyan Even before this, Roslyn's dream was broken when Ram Gopal Varma's film could never come back on track
 ramgopal verma roselin khan ko lekar 'savita bhabhi' naam kii ek film banane vaale the magar wo film nahin ban saki
 Roslyn said, "I feel that till now my destiny has not supported me in Bollywood
" do baar naseeb ne mujhe dhokhaa diya he jab main do badi filmon kaa hissaa banane ja rahi thi jise bollywood ke do bade filmkaar banane ja rahe the
 First of all Ramgopal Varma's film 'savita Bhabhi' stopped in which i was going to work
 wo film shuru ho hi nahin pai
 After that Neeraj ji was making a film with me called 'bhabhi Online' but he passed away before the start of these films
 mujhe behad afsos he unki maut kaa kyonki wo bahut hi pratibhashali the
 "roslyn hopes that the coming new year may bring some new joy for her as she has now started anew for her work and is in talks with 2-3 filmmakers
 isse pehle bhi roselin kaa sapana tab tutaa tha jab ramgopal verma kii film bhi kabhi patari par aa hi nahin saki
 Ram Gopal Varma was about to make a film called 'savita Bhabhi' with Roslyn Khan but she could not make it
 roselin ne kaha ki ''mujhe lagata he ki abtak mere naseeb ne bollywood main meraa saath nahin diya he
 Naseeb has cheated me twice when i was going to be a part of two big films which were going to be made by two big Bollywood filmmakers
 sabase pehle ramgopal verma kii film 'savita bhabhi' ruk gai jisamen main kaam karne vaali thi
 That film could not begin
 uske baad niraj ji mujhe lekar ek film bana rahe the jiskaa naam tha 'bhabhi online' magar in film ke shuru hone se pehle wo chal based
 i am very sorry for his death because he was very talented
 " roselin ko ummid he ki aane vaala nayaa saal unke liye shaayad kuch nai khushi lekar aae kyonki ab wo nae sire se apane kaam ke liye khojbin shuru kar chuki hai or 2-3 filmkaaron se unki baat chal rahi he
 First of all Ramgopal Varma's film 'savita Bhabhi' stopped in which i was going to work

 BJP has also started a counter attack after Rahul Gandhi's allegations against Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 sabase pehle kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne rahul gandhi ke aaropon kaa jawaab diya
 Thereafter, BJP leaders and ministers have come to the rescue of the Prime Minister on charges of Rahul Gandhi
 grih rajyamantri kiran rigiju ne bhi pradhanmantri modi kaa bachaav karte hue rahul gandhi kii aaropon par hi sawaal uthaa die hai
 Kiran Rijiju says that Rahul Gandhi's words should not be taken seriously, no one takes them seriously
 ghotaalaa kisko kehete hai, ghotaalaa wo he jo congress ne kiya
 The Congress scam, 2G scam, coal scam, Adarsh scam, helicopter scam in which thousands of crores were not looted by the country, is the real scam
 aise hi hawa main kaagaj laharaa ke kam ho jaataa he kya
 The Minister of State for Home said that the Prime Minister is working for the country, we are all working
 yah sab dhyaan divert karne ke liye kiya ja rahaa he, jisamen vah kaamyaab nahin honge
 We will continue to do our work, even in the Supreme Court, the paper which was not taken into consideration does not suit him by talking such things by waving paper in the air and talking nonsense about the Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri dwaara safai dene ke bare main kiran rigiju kaa kahana he ki jawaab uskaa die jate, jisamen koi dam ho hamen unako gambhirtha se nahin lenaa chahie
 No person in the country takes Rahul Gandhi seriously
 yah to sabko maaloom ho chukaa he lagaae gaye aaropon main kisi maamle main koi dam nahin he
 The court also said that no case is made on this
 sharad yadav bole pehle bhi ho chukaa he khulhasacongress ke upaadhyaksh dwaara diary bam giraane par bole jadyu ke varisht netaa sharad yadav ki pehle bhi iskaa kulasa ho chukaa he, ye aarope rahul gandhi ne pehali baar nahin lagaaya
 The case is going on in the Supreme Court, the court has given the next date for hearing, Prashant Bhushan is fighting this case
 sharad yadav ne kaha ki arvind kejariwal ne bhi is bare main dilli ki vidhaan sabha main kulasa kiya tha
 On Rahul's disclosure, Sharad Yadav said that i will not comment on this, i have spoken to Prashant Bhushan, he says he has more documents
 wo bahut gambhir insaan he, 11 tarikh ko ucch nyaayalay me is masale par sunwaayee he doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani ho jaayegaa
 On Rajiv Pratap Rudy's accusations against Rahul on Warrahul, Union Minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy said that Rahul Gandhi does not know that the Supreme Court has rejected the allegations he has made on the PM
 rudi ne kaha ki jab desh main kuch hota he to rahul gandhi videsh main hote he isliye unhen desh ke bare koi jaankaree nahin he koi unako bataa detaa he to bol dete he
 The court has already rejected the document that Rahul has, due to his attitude, the Congress is being confined all over the country
 vahiin lalu yadav par rudi ne kaha ki lalu pehle apane aap ko dekh len vah khud court se sajaaftaa he
 The court has banned him from contesting elections; Lalu has made a name for himself in the world by eating money in the fodder scam
 kejariwal par nishaanaa sadhate hue rudi ne kaha ki kejariwal ji kii jameen khisakati ja rahi he, ab vah kuch bhi kahen log us par vishwaas nahin karte he
 Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said that Rahul Gandhi does not know what he says and does not know, but the Supreme Court has already rejected those he is alleging
 vahiin apane bare main bolte hue unhone kaha ki meraa naam diary main kyon hoga meraa naam nahin he

 itani badi chahat ke tuutane kaa dukh maine badi hi qareebi se mahasoos kiya
 
 
 The next morning i reached Rishikesh
 
 
 maine ganga main dubkee lagaai
 
 
 Ganga is the river whose name i had heard so much but was seeing it for the first time
 
 
 mujhe rishikesh ke shivanand ashram ke bare main bataaya gaya tha
 
 
 i went there 
 
 main jaise hi ashram main ghusaa mujhe ek vicitra si tarang mahasoos hui jisane meri baichaiyn aatma ko raahat di
 
 
 The monks were sitting around engrossed in meditation
 
 
 mujhe laga ki koi mujhe pareshaan kar rahe sawaalon kaa jawaab degaa, meri chintaaon ko shant karegaa
 
 
 i got a chance to meet Swami Shivanand
 
 
 mere muslim hone se unhen koi fark nahin padaa
 
 
 Rather, before i said anything, they asked me about my concern
 
 
 main hairaan tha ki unhen mere pareshaani kaa ahsaas kaise ho gaya
 
 
 He said you do not have to become a pilot of Muskabil Air Force
 
 
 tumhen jo bananaa he wo pehle se tay he
 But even after becoming something, this unfulfilled dream continued to follow him
 raashtrapati banane ke baad bhi sataata rahaa ki payalat nahin ban paaya
 Sharing this pain at the Jaipur Literature Festival, he said that in 2005 when i was the President, the Chief of the Air Force came to me

 Kalam saheb's last tweet comes at eleven and a half that i am going to IM Shillong
 Creating a Livable Planet Earth vishay par vyaakhyaan dene ke liye
 After this tweet, at twelve o'clock, Kalam Saheb leaves by plane to fly to Guwahati
 baithte vakt srijan paal singh ne unke kaale rang ke suut kii tarif bhi kii
 During the two-and-a-half-hour journey, the aircraft also ate hiccups amidst the monsoon clouds
 unke liye ye ek saamaanya si baat ho chuki thi
 Whenever he saw me frightened in a moving ship, he removed the curtains of the window and while looking outside said that you will not be afraid anymore
 srijan likhte hai ki iske baad dhai ghante tak ham im shilong tak sadak ke raste se nikle
 During the five hours he kept talking to me, discussing
 beete chah saal main unke saath kii gai saikadon vimaan or sadak yatraaon main ye aakiri thi, har mulaaqaat khaas hoti thi
 In the last visit, Dr
 Kalam was very worried about the terrorist attack in Punjab
 begunaah logon ke maare jane se wo dukhi the
 At IIM Shillong he was to deliver a lecture on the topic Creating a Livable Planet Earth
 unhone punjab kii ghatana ko vishay se jodate hue kaha ki lagata he pradooshan kii hi tarah aadmi kii banaai takatein dharti ke liye zyaada bada khatara ban gai hai
 After this, we talked about violence, pollution and human interference in nature and said that in such a situation, the earth will not be worth living
 unhone kaha ki shaayad agle tees saal main dharti kii itani buree haalat ho jaae isliye aap logon ko turant iske liye kuch karnaa hoga
 His final concerns included how to end the deadlock in Parliament
 kya kiya jaae ki bahes ho
 Matter
 samvaad ho
 He believed that the deadlock was not right
 tippaniyan Dr
 Kalam said that i have seen two different governments in my tenure
 hamen vikaas kii raajnneeti ke liye sansad ke istemaal kaa koi rasta nikaalnaa hi hoga
 He then asked me to prepare a surprise assignment question for the students of IIM Shillong which they would give to the students at the end of the lecture
 wo chaahate the ki chaatr sansad ko or behatar or kargar banane ke liye nayab raste sujhaayen
 But then after some time he asked me how can i ask him to give me a solution when i have no solution for this
 agle ek ghante tak ham isi mudde par samaadhaan dhundne kii koshish main maathapai karte rahe
 We reached the lecture hall
 
 
 wo lacture ke liye der nahin karnaa chaahate the
 
 
 He always said that students should not be made to wait
 
 
 maine turant unka mike lagaaya
 
 
 Talked on lecture and sat in front of computer
 
 
 jab main unhen mike laga rahaa tha to wo hansate hue bole "funny guy! Are you doing well? dow
 Kalam had many meanings to say 'funny guy'
 
 
 unki awaz or maahaul ke hisaab se aapako khud andaaza lagaana hota tha
 
 
 It could also mean that you did well and also that you did something wrong
 
 
 chah saal tak unke saath rahane ke dauraan unke 'funny guy' kehane kaa arth nikaalnaa main sikh gaya tha
 
 
 So when he said "funny guy! Are you doing well, i smiled and said" Yes ", these were his last words to me
 
 
 main unke peeche baitha tha
 
 
 He took a long pose two minutes after the speech began
 
 
 ek lanbaa centens puraa kar wo ruke or phir gir pade
 
 
 We picked them up
 
 
 doctor aae
 
 
 He tried his best
 
 
 unki adhkhuli ankhon ko main kabhi nahin bhul saktaa
 
 
 i held his head with one hand and the doctors tried to bring him back to consciousness but he did not get up
 
 
 unhone ek shabd nahin kaha, dard kaa ahsaas tak unamem nahin dikhaa
 
 
 After four o'clock in the evening, the process of people coming started
 har aane vaala apane saath unki yaaden lekar aayaa tha
