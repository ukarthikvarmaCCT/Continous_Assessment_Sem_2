 There can be more number of leaders who have such desire

 Even the party has decided not to react to any of his allegations or questions

 Tuesday night 8 near NCP
 30 baje tak kaa tha vaktensipi ne subah 11
 The letter sent to the Governor at 30 o'clock, the NCP sought a three-day extension from the Governor, but no party or coalition government in Maharashtra was able to stake claim to form the government, due to which President's rule was imposed in the state
 bijepi ke alaava sabhi vipakshi dal is faisle kaa virodh kar rahe hai or rajyapal par sawaal uthaate hue yah aarope laga rahe hai ki unhen sarkaar banane ke liye paryaapt samay nahin diya gaya
 However, a surprising thing is that the NCP sent its letter to the Governor well ahead of schedule on Tuesday, after which President's Rule was recommended
 darasal, bijepi or shivasena ke fail hone ke baad rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari ne somvaar (11 november) shaam rashtravaadi congress party (NCP) ko sarkaar banane kaa ofer diya tha
 Tuesday night 8 to present claim to NCP
 30 baje tak kaa vakt diya gaya tha
 But NCP did 11 in the morning
 30 baje hi apana patr rajyapal ko bhej diya
 What was in the letter of the NCP? The letter sent by the NCP to the Raj Bhavan did not claim to form a government nor did it mention a letter of support
 is letters main ensipi ne rajyapal se teen din kii mohalat maangi
 The Governor did not accept this demand and made the recommendation of the Union Home Ministry to impose President's rule in Maharashtra, making the ncp's letter the basis
 samay se pehle ensipi ne kyon bheja patr?ab sawaal ye bhi uth rahe hai ki ensipi ke paas mangalvaar raat 8
 He had 11 in the morning despite having time till 30 o'clock
 30 baje hi rajyapal ko apana patr kyon bhej diya
 These questions are also more important because during this time important meeting of Congress Working Committee was going on in Delhi

 isiilie hamane rajyapal ko patr bheja or teen din kii mohalat dene kii maang kii
 Another interesting thing is that Shiv Sena and Congress are vociferously opposing the issue of President's rule and short time
 shivasena to supreme court tak pahunch gai he or congress kah rahi he ki jis tareeke se sarkaar ne raashtrapati shashan lagu kiya he, vah loktantr kaa majaak he
 While the NCP sees President's rule as a relief
 mangalvaar shaam apane bayaan main ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ne ye kaha ki raashtrapati shashan donon dalon (congress or ensipi) ko charchaa karne ke liye ek raahat kii tarah he

 sahitya ajtak par padhie gyaan chaturvedi ke janmdin par unke vyangyatmak upanyaas 'paagalakhaana' kaa ek anshpustak anshah paagalakhanabhagwan bazaar ke saath tha kyonki vah pagal nahin thacycetrist kii usee clinics kii ek diwaar main bhagwaan kaa sundar-sa aalaa bana he
 Light bulbs are lit in front of the idol
 bhagwaan yahan bevajaah muskuraate baithe hai
 They are staring at everything so completely as if this world should not be their created world
 
 
 yaa shaayad yah unke haathon se nikal gai duniya ho!abhi clinics main badi bheed he
 Keeps on living 'kya ho gaya baba ko?’ ek bachche ke saath adhed-si aurat baithi he
 He asked the woman with the old man sitting nearby, as if, just to cut the time
 boodha oongh rahaa he
 It is difficult to tell whether he is sleeping on the sofa waiting for his turn or is under the influence of medicines given by the doctor
 uske paas baithi uski patni oonghate pati ko badi chintit nigahon se dekh hi rahi thi jab bachche ke saath ai aurat ne usase poocha ki baba ko kya ho gaya he?idhar baccha ekadam chup baitha hua he
 He smiles in the middle, without looking at anyone
 ekaadh baar vah jor se hansaa bhi to saath ai aurat ne use chup baithne ko kaha
 The child's smile and laughter is not like that of a child, and the thing that is frightening is that it does not scare anyone here
 samay aisa he ki bachche tak pagal hue ja rahe hai or sab log ise ekadam saamaanya-si ghatana maan lete hai
 'what happened to Baba?' He then asked
 'pataa nahin!
 
 
 Just live scared day and night! ' The old lady said looking anxiously towards the old man
 'kyon? kis baat kaa dar?’'bas, ghabaraae rahete hai
 Don't sleep at all 
 
 
 They do not sit quietly in one place
 baichaiyn ghoomte hai ghar bhar main
 
 
 
 zaraa-zaraa-si aahat par bhi chaunk jate hai
 
 
 
 raat bhar palang par chaukanne baithe rahete hai
 Don't sleep 
 
 
 Always afraid
 ’ jab koi yon sahanubhutipurvak puch hi rahaa he to aurat ne apana sara dard ek saath udel diya
 What do you say? 
 
 akhir kya dar he?’'ab kya kahen aapako
 
 
 Shame to tell
 
 
 
 Things like children! ”still
 
 
 ?’'kehete hai ki ham donon ab june purana saamaan ho gaye hai
 
 
 
 ghar main ham kisi puraane atale jaise pade rahete hai
 
 
 
 kehete rahete hai ki apane bachche hamen kahin oelex par na nikaal den
 
 
 
 ghar kaa purana-dhurana saamaan bechney kii internet par koi jagah he na- oelex, vahiin! hardam yahi kehete hai ki kahin se jo kabhi inako hamaare thik daam mil gaye to ye bachche zarur hamen online bech denge
 "how so?" They show in the advertisement and not just take a picture of the stuff and put it on OLX, then someone takes a purchase
 
 
 
 There are many customers of old goods as well nowadays
 ’'are yah to thik he, par inako apana aisa kyon lag rahaa he?’'bas, ek din ye baraamde main baithe the, yun hi aaraam kursi par
 The son bought a new mobile that day
 usne apana yah mobile inako bhi dikhaaya
 Took a picture of him as well
 phir dikhaane laga ki dekho papa, kitni shandaar photu ai he aapaki!
 
 
 Just after that, this is their condition
 kehete hai ki hamen murkh samajhataa he betaa ki ham asli baat ko nahin samajhenge
 'but i immediately understood
 usne mujhe bechney ke liye hi aisi shandaar tasviir khinchi he taaki graahak ko saamaan pasand aa jaae
 'from that day on, that's all, it's been rote
 bete ne bahut samajhaayaa
 Others have also talked to him
 khub samajhaayaa he sabane
 But these are not the same
 ab to ghar ke baahar kahin zaraa-si aahat bhi ho, koi postman bhi darvaaze kii ghanti bajaae- chaunkkar idhar-udhar bhaagane lagate hai ki zarur koi graahak aa gaya he!
 
 
 'the old lady was in tears, telling everything
 bachche ke saath ai aurat sari ramakatha dhyaan se sunati rahi
 In between, she also kept looking at the old man who is sitting on the sofa a bit
 budhiya sari ramakahani kahkar ab chup ho gai thi
 The woman too kept quiet after listening to everything
 phir vah aurat budhiya ke kaan ke paas aakar ekadam fusfusaakar boli, 'kya pataa ki baba shaayad sach hi kah rahe hon?’'ji?’ budhiya ne aashcharya se use dekha
 'yes! May be Baba is not mad
 maan lo ki ve sach kah rahe hon?
 
 
 Suppose you are afraid of the right thing, then? "what kind of strange things are you doing?" See mother, anywhere in the world, when anything happens for the first time, we feel strange at first! "it means that you also believe that our son now considers us old stuff?" Why can't we accept? Tell me And that's why, many children believe the same
 
 
 
 Yes, your son's idea of putting parents out online like any old stuff is definitely new
 ’'uskaa aisa koi bhi idia nahin he, samajhiin aap?’ budhiya naaraaz hone lagi
 'don't be angry
 bhagwaan kare ki aisa hi ho
 
 
 
 parantu, vaise aapako yah kaise pataa ki uskaa aisa koi idia nahin he? ho saktaa he ki ho
 
 
 
 kyon nahin ho saktaa? 
 
 
 It is possible that Baba has understood everything and you are in misconception? or yah aisi ghatiya baat bhi nahin he
 Just think! Why can't it be that some attractive scheme to buy old parents has recently been launched in the market? 
 
 aajkal bazaar main kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 It happens every day
 are, jab kachra kareedne kii scimen tak laanch ho rahi hai to yah kyon nahin ho sakati?’'aap bhi pagal hai kya?’'dekhie, naaraaz na hon
 
 
 
 baat ko tanik samajhen
 
 
 
 main koi galat nahin bol rahi
 i just told you that Uncle may not be crazy
 
 
 
 It may be that your son has sent you here
 
 
 ’'kisalie bheja ho?
 
 
 The old lady was in a fit of breath
 'shaayad isiilie bheja ho ki yahan kii dawaaiyon ke nashe main ankal ghar main sote rah jaaen or inhen sote-sote hi, aaraam se pack karke kisi karidaar ko pakadaaya ja sake
 It would be difficult to sell a waking man, only then
 
 
 
 If the father stays awake, then he can even make a noise 
 
 graahak bhadak jayega
 
 
 
 bazaar maanata he ki kuch bhi ho, graahak ko nahin bhadakna chahie
 Customer tops
 
 
 ’'aap to na jane kya-kya bole chali ja rahi hai
 
 
 
 ’'maine to aapako bas ek baat bataai
 
 
 
 zamana badal gaya he antee
 
 
 
 sanbhalkar rahiega
 Take care of them properly too
 
 
 
 Listen properly to what he is saying and also understand what he is saying
 
 
 
 Maybe Uncle is right? ”the old lady panicked and slipped away from the woman a little
 usne saath baithi aurat ko ghurkar dekha
 What crazy things was this woman still doing! 
 
 kahin ye khud hi to yahan ilaaj ke liye nahin laai gai he? pagaliane main yah fark karnaa kabhi-kabhi kathin ho jaataa he ki yah jo saamne abhi aapse mil rahaa he, vah pagal he yaa pagal kaa timaardaar, yaa phir pagaliane kaa koi karmchaaree?idhar aurat ke saath baitha baccha budhiya ko ghur rahaa he
 The child smiled openly on seeing the old woman as if he had known his mind! Then that child started laughing
 aurat ne bachche kii peeth par haath rakhkar samajhaayaa, 'betaa, aise nahin hanste
 
 
 
 sab disturb hote hai
 
 
 
 ’par baccha hansataa hi rahaa
 On the other hand, the old man is sitting very quietly
 baccha budhiya kii taraf dekhakar hanse ja rahaa he
 The old lady became uncomfortable looking at the idol of God held in the ground
 bhagwaan bevazah muskura rahaa he
 
 
 
 shaayad yahi vah samay tha jab bhagwaan bhi bazaar ke saath ho gaya tha
 
 
 
 maano isi main uski bhalaai bhi thi

 mahilaon ke mangalageet gane ke saath puure gaanv ne sadak tak aakar in shikshakon ko vidaai di
 'master Sir, do not leave us crying' is the first story of teacher Avnish Yadav
 ve ab tak devaria ke gauribazar block ke praathmik vidhyalay, pipradhanni main pradhanadhyaapak ke pad par tainaat the
 Originally from the village of Babhnavali in Ghazipur, Avneesh was posted to this school in 2009, when the education situation in the village was very bad
 gaanv ke log bacchon ko skool hi nahin bhejte the
 Avnish went to the Harijan colony and the working class to persuade people to send children to school
 2013 main banaae gaye principalitnaa hi nahin, unhone iske saath hi abhibhavakon se skool kii khamiyaan bhi bataane ko kaha
 Avneesh diligently taught the children
 jarurat padane par khud hi unhen copy-pencil kharid kar bhi deen
 It was because of his work that Avneesh was promoted to headmaster in 2013 in the same school
 avanish kii mehnat se naa sirf shiksha ke halaat badale balki unhone gaanv kii samasyaon ko dur karaane main bhi yogadan kiya
 Recently, Avnish was transferred to his home district of Ghazipur, and when he arrived to bid farewell to the school, the whole village was inconsolable
 bacchon ko foot-footkar rota dekh avanish kii ankhon se khud bhi aansuon kii dhara bah nikali
 What children, women, every person in the village was seen saying, 'masterji don't leave us crying
 ''hamaare saraji waapas le aao, unki bahut yaad aati he'avanish se milti hi kahani he munish kumaar kii
 Munish was till now posted as Principal in primary school in Rampura village in Shahabad area of rampur district
 isse pehle wo isi ilaake main parota praathmik vidhyalay main sahaayak adhyaaapak ke pad par rah chuke hai
 Munish Kumar, a native of Mainpuri, worked so hard that he changed the picture of education in the village itself
 band baaja ke saath vidaayeeunaki mehnat ko dekhte hue unhen rampura praathmik vidhyalay kaa pradhanadhyaapak bana diya gaya
 When Munish was recently transferred to his native district, he reached school after being relieved
 skool ke bacchon, shikshakon or gaanv ke har shaks ko aisa laga ki jaise unke ghar kaa koi apana hi unase dur ja rahaa he
 Nevertheless, the villagers sent Munish off with a full gazelle
 'aaj tak' kii team ne jab rampura praathmik vidhyalay ke bacchon ke saath baat kii to ve apane munish sar ko yaad kar dobaaraa rone lage
 They also started saying, 'bring back our heads, they are very much missed, no one was better than them and no one will come
 ' skulon main padhaane se jo shikshak kataraate hai, unhen avanish or munish se sikh leni chahie
 This is the spirit that can change the picture of education in the countryside

 The people of the Muslim community, who were protesting on the streets, asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to break their silence on this whole issue and demanded to find a middle ground soon on the issue of Muslims slaughtering and Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar
 rohingya musalamaanon ke mudde par centre sarkaar ke rukh kaa virodh karte hue pradarshnakariyon ne kaha ki agar modi sarkaar is masale kaa samaadhaan nahin nikaalati he to ve log naa keval dilli main apni aawaaj uthaaenge balki sanyukt raashtra main bhi is mudde ko lekar jaaenge
 The protesters say that Buddhists were once seen as messengers of peace, but in Myanmar these people have created terror and are killing Muslims living there

 a new confidence is seen in the gesture of the players of Team India practicing in Bengaluru before the Test
 vanade or T-20 series ganvaane ke baad mohali main team india ne zabardast vaapasi kii or number van test team ko 3 dinon main dhul chataa diya
 The team's troubles in the Bengaluru Test are seen to be growing
 vernon philendar anfit hokar series se baahar ho gaye hai, vahiin del sten duusare test se baahar ho gaye hai, lekin bhartiya captain viraat kohli jaraa bhi riyaayat dene ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 He said, "I didn't worry about what was on his mind and what's going on
 ham sakaaratmak cricket khelnaa chaahate hai
 Our effort is to increase difficulties for the opponents
 " The curator of the Chinnaswamy Stadium says the pitch will be helpful for the spinners

 Prakashasan, angry with pm's silence on Gauri Lankesh, wrote in his column in a weekly news paper named 'anand Vikatan', Hindu right-wingers in the past used to argue only intellectually on their disputes with other religious groups, but as soon as Their way failed, they started resorting to muscle power and now they have adopted the path of violence

 India may occupy the top position in World Cup Group B, but their quarter-final seat is not fully confirmed and Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team can still be stuck in the juggle of Agar
 yah sthiti haalanki kaalpanik he lekin abhi yah nahin kaha ja saktaa he ki bhartiya team quarter final main pahunch gai he
 India have seven points from five matches and now have to play the West Indies in their last league match on 20 March
 bhartiya team yadi us match main jeet darj karti he to vah sidhe quarter final main pahunch jaaegi lekin vah isse pehle bhi nakout charan main jagah bana sakati he haalanki yah duusari tiimon ke parinaam par nirbhar karegaa
 England are still the most vulnerable in Group b and will have to win the West Indies in their next match to make it to the last eight
 yadi andrew straas kii team isamen asafal rahati he to phir bharat apane agle match se pehle hi quarter final main pahunch jayega
 If England beat West Indies by a big margin, they will also have seven points
 iske vipareet yadi carabian team bharat par baari padati he tathaa is bich hone vaale maichon main bangladesh apane donon match jeet letaa he or dakshin africa kii team ireland ko haraane ke baad bangladesh se haar jaati he to phir bhartiya team kii pareshaaniyaan bad sakati hai
 In such a situation, the teams of West Indies, South Africa and Bangladesh will reach the next round with eight points each while India and England will be seven points each and the team that reaches the quarter-finals will be decided by the net run rate
 group e main aisi sthiti nahin dikh rahi he
 New Zealand's team from this group has reached the quarter-finals with a win over Canada today
 uske ab paanch match main aath ank hai
 Sri Lanka have already made it to the last eight with seven points from five matches as Canada and Kenya are eliminated from the group for the knockout race and will still have six if Zimbabwe win the next two matches
 pakistan ke chaar match main chah ank hai or vah kal zimbabwe par jeet darj karke agle charan main jagah pakki karne ke liye utrega
 Australia will also make it to the second round by registering a win over Kenya
 iskaa matlab he ki group e se chotii kii chaaron timen quarter final main pahunchengi lekin group bi main england yaa bharat visheshkar england par pehle daur main baahar hone kaa khatra mandara rahaa he

 The High Court has issued new orders to the Delhi Police and Delhi Government regarding the installation and maintenance of CCTV cameras in Delhi
 dilli sarkaar ne hoicourt ko bataaya ki puure shahar main 4388 samvedansheel jagahon par sisitivi camere laga die gaye hai lekin usamen se sirf 2919 sisitivi camere hi kaam kar rahe hai jabaki baaki ke kharaab camaron kii marammat kaa kaam abhi chal rahaa he
 Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice C
 harishankar kii bench ne dilli police ke vakil se kaha ki vah kharaab camaron kii marammat yaa to jald puraa karaae yaa phir use badal de
 The court said that the government is repairing the faulty cameras and now there is no need to hear it
 sushamaa swaraj ko shradhanjali dene ke liye yahaan clic karendilli sarkaar ne mahila suraksha se judi ek janhit yachika kii sunwaayee ke dauraan 15 farvari ko court ko bataaya tha ki sabhi thane or police chaukiyon main ek maheene ke bheetar sisitivi camere laga die jaaenge

 Also keep regular monitoring about the cameras working
 nigaraanee kaa kaam bhi kisi swatantra nikaay jaise siaisef jaisi agency ko die jane kii baat bhi court ne kahi
 Explain that the court had earlier directed the Chief Secretary of the Delhi Government to hold a meeting with the concerned bodies and agencies under his chairmanship and ensure that street lights should be installed at all places
 saath hi street lite ke kharaab hone par koun adhikari usko thik karavaayega, ye tay karne ke nirdesh bhi court ne die
 At the same time, the government had said that 1 in the sensitive places of Delhi
 40 lakh sisitivi camere saal ke ant tak laga die jaaenge
 Also all cameras will be connected to the centralized center
 jisase court chaahe to sabhi kii jaanch vakil ko court ayukta banaakar karvaa saktaa he
 From this, the court came to know that out of 4388 CCTV cameras, only 2919 cameras are currently working

 1 (vibe UI) ravivaar ko wimbledon main itihaas kaa bananaa tay he
 It will be seen who makes history
 wimbledon ke final main roger federr or endi mare ke bich takkar hogi
 Whichever one wins in this match, history will be made
 agar roger federr jite to yah wimbledon ke maidan par unka saatvaan grand slam khitaab hoga
 He will be able to match Pete Sampras' world record and his Grand Slam title will be 17
 pehle se hi vah sabase aage chal rahe hai
 On the other hand, there is Andy Murray, the British player who has reached the Wimbledon final after a 74-year long wait
 lekin ahm sawaal yah he ki kya mare itihaas bana paaenge
 
 
 
 ek myne main yah muqabla tennis ke in do diggaj khilaadiyon kii patibaddhta kii misaal bhi he
 Roger Federer is counted among the all-time greatest players in the tennis world
 unke naam 16 grand slam khitaab hai lekin beete dhai saal ke dauraan vah koi bhi grand slam khitaab nahin jeet paae hai
 This does not mean that Federer's game was beginning to deteriorate
 30 saal ke federr ko rafaal nadal or novak jokovich se kadi chunauti kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa tha
 Federer, despite showing his best game, was lagging behind the duo's speed and court coverage
 lekin federr aasaani se haar maanane waalon main nahin hai
 He once again proved this
 2008 main jab novak jokovich ne australian open ke final main unhen haraaya tab jokovich kii maa ne ek bayaan diya tha
 
 
 'the King is Dead
 
 
 '
 His assessment proved to be wrong and Federer still managed to win the Grand Slam after that
 is baar to semifinal main federr ke haathon mili haar ke baad jokovich ne bhi kaha he ki federr phir se number van banane ke upyukt hai
 Federer would again become number one after winning Wimbledon
 aisa hua to peet sampraas ke 286 saptaah tak number van banane ke world record kii barabari bhi federr kar lenge
 On the other hand, there is Andy Murray
 mare kii badakismati yah he ki vah us daur main tennis khel rahe hai jab federr nadal or jokovich kisi chauthe ke liye jagah chhodane ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 Therefore, he remains at number four among the best four players
 vah wimbledon main itihaas bana sakate hai lekin iske liye unhen khud ko jhonk dena hoga
 Local audiences in London will also strongly support Murray, but it will not be easy for him to overcome Federer
 vaise to federr ko vah kai baar haraa chuke hai lekin grand slam ke final main vah unke saamne koi chunauti pesh nahin kar paae hai
 Federer defeated Murray in straight sets in the finals of the 2008 US Open and 2010 Australian Open
 tippaniyan It is said that each round is itself a competition and thrill
 har daur main do lijends ke bich badshahath kii hode dekhne laayak hoti he lekin tennis ke prashansakon ke liye yah tennis kaa sabase behtareen daur he
 The audience of this round is getting a chance to see such strong players as Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray
 ek samaan str par itani behtareen tennis kaa daur isse pehle kabhi nahin dikhaa
 Anyway, geniuses are not born every day
 kam se kam roger federr jaise jeniyas ke liye tennis ko lanbaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 It is definitely that the level of tennis will increase in the coming days
 aane vaale yuvaaon kii kshamta bhi badhegi
 But in tennis, Federer will be one
 is mukaable main jeet chaahe jisaki ho, itihaas banegaa
 If Roger Federer wins, it will be his seventh Grand Slam title at the Wimbledon ground
 peet sampraas ke world record kii barabari vah kar lenge or unke grand slam kitaabon kii sankhya 17 ho jaaegi
 He is already at the forefront
 vahiin duusari ore, endi mare hai jo 74 saal ke lambey intjaar ke baad wimbledon final main pahunchane kaa karnama dikhaane vaale british khilaadi hai
 But the important question is whether Murray will be able to make history
 
 
 
 In a sense, this match is also an example of the commitment of these two tennis players
 roger federr tennis kii duniya ke sarvakalik mahaan khilaadiyon main gine jate hai
 He has 16 Grand Slam titles to his name but has not won any Grand Slam titles during the last two and a half years
 iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki federr kaa khel kharaab hone laga tha
 The 30-year-old Federer was facing a tough challenge from Rafal Nadal and Novak Djokovic
 federr apana sarvshereshth khel dikhaane ke baavjood in donon kii teji or court kawarej ke saamne pichhadane lage the
 But Federer is not one to give up easily
 yah baat ek baar phir se unhone sabit kar di
 Djokovic's mother made a statement in 2008 when Novak Djokovic defeated him in the Australian Open final
 
 
 'da king iz ded
 
 
 '
 unka akalan galat sabit hua or federr uske baad bhi grand slam jeetne main kaamyaab rahe
 This time, Djokovic has also said that Federer is fit to become number one again after the defeat at the hands of Federer in the semi-finals
 wimbledon jeetne ke baad federr phir se number van ban jaaenge
 If this happens, Pete Sampras will also match the world record of becoming number one for 286 weeks
 duusari ore, endi mare hai
 Murray's misfortune is that he is playing tennis at a time when Federer Nadal and Djokovic are not ready to leave room for a fourth
 isliye vah sarvshereshth chaar khilaadiyon main chauthe number par hi bane hue hai
 He can make history at Wimbledon but for that he will have to give himself up
 landan main sthaneey darshak bhi mare kaa joardaar samarthan karenge lekin federr se paar paanaa unke liye itnaa aasaan bhi nahin hoga
 Although he has defeated Federer several times, but he has not been able to present any challenge to him in the final of the Grand Slam
 2008 ke yues open or 2010 ke australian open ke final main federr ne mare ko sidhe seton main haraaya he
 The comments kaha jaataa he ki har daur apane aap main pratisparddhi or romaanchakta kaa put liye hota he
 In every round, the race between the two legends is worth seeing, but for tennis fans, this is the best round of tennis
 is daur ke darshakon ko ek saath roger federr, novak jokovich, rafoyal nadal or endi mare jaise damdaar khilaadiyon ko dekhne ko mauka mil rahaa he
 Never before has there been such a great round of tennis at the same level
 vaise bhi jeniyas roj roj paidaa nahin hote
 Tennis will have to wait a long time, at least for a genius like Roger Federer
 yah jarur he ki aane vaale dinon main tennis kaa str or badhegaa
 The capacity of the coming youth will also increase
 lekin tennis main federr to ek hi hoga
 On the other hand, there is Andy Murray, the British player who has reached the Wimbledon final after a 74-year long wait
 lekin ahm sawaal yah he ki kya mare itihaas bana paaenge
 
 
 
 ek myne main yah muqabla tennis ke in do diggaj khilaadiyon kii patibaddhta kii misaal bhi he
 Roger Federer is counted among the all-time greatest players in the tennis world
 unke naam 16 grand slam khitaab hai lekin beete dhai saal ke dauraan vah koi bhi grand slam khitaab nahin jeet paae hai
 This does not mean that Federer's game was beginning to deteriorate
 30 saal ke federr ko rafaal nadal or novak jokovich se kadi chunauti kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa tha
 Federer, despite showing his best game, was lagging behind the duo's speed and court coverage
 lekin federr aasaani se haar maanane waalon main nahin hai
 He once again proved this
 2008 main jab novak jokovich ne australian open ke final main unhen haraaya tab jokovich kii maa ne ek bayaan diya tha
 
 
 'the King is Dead
 
 
 '
 His assessment proved to be wrong and Federer still managed to win the Grand Slam after that
 is baar to semifinal main federr ke haathon mili haar ke baad jokovich ne bhi kaha he ki federr phir se number van banane ke upyukt hai
 Federer would again become number one after winning Wimbledon
 aisa hua to peet sampraas ke 286 saptaah tak number van banane ke world record kii barabari bhi federr kar lenge
 On the other hand, there is Andy Murray
 mare kii badakismati yah he ki vah us daur main tennis khel rahe hai jab federr nadal or jokovich kisi chauthe ke liye jagah chhodane ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 Therefore, he remains at number four among the best four players
 vah wimbledon main itihaas bana sakate hai lekin iske liye unhen khud ko jhonk dena hoga
 Local audiences in London will also strongly support Murray, but it will not be easy for him to overcome Federer
 vaise to federr ko vah kai baar haraa chuke hai lekin grand slam ke final main vah unke saamne koi chunauti pesh nahin kar paae hai
 Federer defeated Murray in straight sets in the finals of the 2008 US Open and 2010 Australian Open
 tippaniyan It is said that each round is itself a competition and thrill
 har daur main do lijends ke bich badshahath kii hode dekhne laayak hoti he lekin tennis ke prashansakon ke liye yah tennis kaa sabase behtareen daur he
 The audience of this round is getting a chance to see such strong players as Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray
 ek samaan str par itani behtareen tennis kaa daur isse pehle kabhi nahin dikhaa
 Anyway, geniuses are not born every day
 kam se kam roger federr jaise jeniyas ke liye tennis ko lanbaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 It is definitely that the level of tennis will increase in the coming days
 aane vaale yuvaaon kii kshamta bhi badhegi
 But in tennis, Federer will be one

 bhartiya janata party kaa kahana he ki paanch rajyon ke chunaav main vikaas ke mudde sabase ahm rahegaa or party isi ko lakar chunaav ladegi
 The party feels that it will benefit more than walking on the issue of development in elections
 iske baad notebandi or sargical strike mudde honge
 In conversation with some BJP leaders, it was clear that the election will be fought on the issue of development, although the leaders have described demonetisation as a historic step of the government against black money and corruption
 kendriya mantri or bijepi ke varisht netaa calraj mishra kaa kahana he ki paanch rajyon kechunavamein ham vikaas ke mudde ko hi aage lekar chalenge
 That will be our big issue
 note bandi to sarkaar kii ore se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf uthaaya gaya ek ahm kadam he
 At the same time, Union Minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti said that demonetization is not the issue, development will be the issue
 party pravaktaa shahanvaj hossain kaa bhi yahi kahana he ki vikaas ke mudde par hi chunaav main ham aage badhenge
 He said that demonetisation is not an issue if the opposition makes it an issue then it will definitely become an issue
 bijepi saansad or uttarakhand ke netaa satpal maharaj kaa bhi yahi kahana he ki vikaas hamaara praathmik mudda hoga or uttarakhand main congress kii jo naakaamiyaan he ham unako ujagar karenge
 Together, we will take Uttarakhand's development forward
 kendriya mantri narendra singh tomars ne kaha ki vikaas hamaara mudda hoga or us par hi ham paanch rajyon main chunaav jeetenge
 On repeatedly asking about demonetisation, Tomar said that demonetisation can also be an issue but development will be the issue
 party ke netaaon se baat karne ke baad ek baat saaf he ki note bandi ke faisle ko lekar logon kii jo pareshaani raheen he use dekhte hue party ne paanch rajyon ke liye vikaas ko mudda chunaa he
 Because in the 2014 elections also Narendra Modi's government was formed on the issue of development
 uske baad maharashtra,haryana, assam main bhi bijepi vikaas ke naam par chunaav ladi or jiti thi
 However, party president Amit Shah, in his speech to the National Executive, also mentioned demonetisation and surgical strike and the government has been praised for these steps
 to saafe he ki chunaav main vikaas ke saath-saath sargical strike or notebandi bhi mudda banenge lekin vikaas kaa mudda hi aage rahegaa

 vahiin, england ko do paaydaan kaa nuksaan hua, team 109 reating ank se dakshin africa se ek sthaan peeche chauthe sthaan par he
 If the Indian team wins both the matches, it will gain one rating point and remain one point ahead of Australia at 118 and reach the top
 lekin agar vah do main se ek match haar jaaegi to bharat ek reating ganvaakar 116 ank se australia se ek ank peeche duusare sthaan par rahegaa

 He said that Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya had struggled with the British to maintain the water flow in the river and even forced him to sign an agreement to maintain minimum level of continuous flow in the Ganges river in Haridwar

 Everyone wants to know how to add more sweetness to love
 ham aapako bataa rahe hai aise tips, jisase aapke pyaar bhare rishton main or garmaahat aa jaaegi
 2
 velentine de ke din apane bedroom ko ‘velentine theme’ den
 That means, put a red sheet on the bed, put a heart shaped pillow on top of it and keep white and red color sheet to cover it
 agar ‘madhoshi’ main khone ke shaukeen hai, to sangeet sunate hue ‘red wine’ kaa majaa len
 As much as possible, give love to your girlfriend and remember the moments of love that are memorable for you
 velentine de par apane prem ko kya or kaise den giftpyar kaa sailaab aap donon ke dil main chhalak aae, iske liye jaruri he ki is maukey par kuch nayab tohfon kaa bhi aadan-pradaan kar liya jaae
 The message reached from the heart reaches the heart properly, for this, not only every time, but many times it goes through your 'pocket'
 kehane kaa matlab yah he ki gift ke maamle main kotahi bilkul na karen
 So here are some select ideas about gifts
 
 
 1
 Beautifully decorate your partner's gift items on a single board, such as a calendar or gifted candy toffee
 yaa phir ek saath dekhi kisi movie kaa tikat ho
 This will make you remember all those moments spent with your girlfriend, which have become memorable for your life
 isse badhiya kuch nahin ho saktaa he ki aap unpar us tarikhon kaa zikr kar den, jis din vah gift aapako mila
 There is no better gift for a girlfriend than a lover
 2
 If you want, you buy a pendulum and cut it into two pieces
 ek tukdaa premika ko den or doosraa khud hi pahan len
 You can also write each other's names on the pendulum
 yah na sirf aapaki premika ke liye, balki aapke liye bhi na bhuulane vaala gift hoga
 3
 ‘vailentaines de de’ ke din apni premika ko ek acha sa parafum bhent karen or us par likh den- ‘main is parafum kii khushboo tumhaare jism par mahasoos karnaa chahta hum
 With the help of this message, you will be able to make him realize that your life is nothing without him
 isse aap yah ehsaas dilaane main kaamyaab ho jaaenge ki bas or bas aap hi uske iklaute or sachcha pyaar he
 Through this message you will also make him feel that you are waiting impatiently to see him like this
 is tarah ke bhent or sandesh se aapkaa vailentaines de de yaadgaar ban jayega
 4
 aksar yah mana jaataa he ki premi ko gift dene main premika ko kaaphi dikkatein aati hai, ve bahut kanfujd rahati hai, par bhramit hone kii koi jarurat he nahin
 If the girlfriend knows well about her lover, then a lot of things are lying in order to give the gift to the lover
 ham aapako bataate hai ki kin gifts ko dekar aap apane premi ko impress kar sakati hai or vailentaines de de ko special bana sakati hai
 5
 ladke aamtaur par gym jate hai or apni body ko feet rakhane kii koshish karte hai, isliye premika ke liye acha hoga ki vailentaines de de ke din vah apane premi ko ek acha-sa trekksoot gift karen
 If possible, gift a pair of jogging shoes with it
 isse aapkaa premi na sirf in gifts ko paakar behad khush hoga, balki jab-jab inhen pehnegaa yaa dekhegaa to premika se milane kii talab se bhi batch nahin paaegaa
 6
 ledar wolet ladakon ko khub bhaataa he
 Every boy wants to have a leather wallet
 ledar wolet kabhi bhi purana fishan nahin hota he
 In such a situation, on Valentine's Day, girlfriend can also gift a leather wallet to her lover
 koshish karen ki ledar wolet ke andar apni or apane premi kii gale lagaate hue photo chipka den
 This will help bring more warmth in your relationship, and will make Valentines Day Day memorable
 7
 Most boys like sports
 saath hi sports se sambandhit chizon ke saath unka lagaav bhi zyada hota he, isliye koshish karen ki apane premi ko velentine de ke din sports kaa koi item gift kare den
 For example, give him a membership gift of a sports club
 pyaar ko or zyada mjedaar banane ke liye gift ke saath ek sandesh laga den or likh den- ‘haev fan, enjoy yor game’
 'happy Valentine's Day'
 jaanate hai, yah padhakar aapkaa premi saatven aasmaan par hoga or yah vailentaines de de uske jivan kaa sabase yaadgaar dinon main se ek din ban jayega
 8
 mohatarama, ek baat aapako bataa duun ki mahilaayein hi nahin, purushon ko bhi fashneble kapade pahananaa acha lagata he, isliye velentine ke din apane premi ko koi aise kapade gift kar den, jise vah atyadhik pasand karata ho
 This will put his personality on four moons and you will also be saved from thinking
 haa iske liye jaruri he ki aap apane premi kii ichchhaaon se bhaleebhanti parichit hon
 9
 ladakon ko saundarya prashaadhan kii chijen bahut bhaati hai
 He wants his girlfriend to gift him a lot of cosmetics on Valentine's Day
 isamen shaving kit se lekar parafum tak shaamil ho sakate hai
