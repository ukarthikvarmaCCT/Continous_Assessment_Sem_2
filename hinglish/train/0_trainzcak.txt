 jeenyu cond ke peeche ekatarfa pyaar tha
 Akash loved the girl who attacked him with an ax and wanted to get married
 lekin ladki use bas apana acha dost maanati thi
 The carriage of the relationship with two different thinking proceeded in a similar way
 akaash ne ladki ko prapoj kar daalaa or jab ladki ne usase duuri banani chaahi to uske upar kulhadi se hamalaa kar khud maut ko gale laga liya
 Whatever happened in JNU on Wednesday was actually the result of a fad of unrequited love
 akaash kaa jo khat mila he, uske mutabik, 'jis din hamane admician liya tha, usee din ham dost ban gaye
 i did everything for him, but i think he used me and cheated on me
 'haalanki ladki ke bhai ne kaha, 'akaash se meri bahan kaa koi rishta nahin tha
 Yes, Akash did propose to her many times
 par meri bahan ne manaa kar diya tha
 'akash has written much more in the letter
 akaash ne likhaa, 'wo meraa majaak banaati thi
 He had a lot in my midst, which is why we were very good friends
 ye baat hamaare doston ko bhi pataa he, lekin aaj ham donon ke bich main uski igo aa gai thi
 She started ignoring that we have known each other for two years
 class main ham ek saath rahete the, class ke baad ham nots ek duusare ko dete the
 She used to eat food with me
 wo mere liye bahut kuch thi
 The girl's brother said, 'both were in the same class
 ek hi rajya se aae the
 Hence there was acquaintance and friendship
 donon baaten bhi karte the
 But like a friend
 haa, jab akaash ne meri bahan ko prapoj karnaa shuru kar diya tab meri bahan ne usase duuri banani shuru kar di thi
 "according to Akash's letter," i do not want to tell what happened to her in my midst, but she suddenly changed
 wo mujhase apaset rahane lagi thi or wo mujhe nazarandaaj karne lagi thi
 i have been more upset since he started making fun of me
 uske ajeeb or iktarafa faisle ke kaaran main ye bahut bada kadam uthaane ja rahaa hum
 The girl's brother said, "my sister used to consider Akash as just a friend
" chunki donon saath padhate the
 She would talk to him like the rest of the class students then
 nots bhi exange karti thi
 My sister is brilliant from the beginning
 wo hameshaa class main second yaa third pojishan laati he
 But when Akash proposed to him, he made a distance from Akash
 usase baat kerani band kar di
 On one side is the suicide note of Akash and on the other side is the statement of the girl's brother
 akaash ye likh kar mar gaya ki wo ladki ke ekatarfa faisle kii vajah se ye kadam uthaa rahaa he
 On the other hand, according to the statement of the girl's brother, Akash fell in love unilaterally
 to kya jeenyu main hue is jaanaleva hamale kii vajah ekatarfa pyaar bana? kya ye dahala dene vaali vaardaat ek naakaam aashiq ke gusse kaa anjaam tha? yaa phir kahani kuch or he?kya he puure vaardaat ke peeche kaa sach?kehete hai jab dil tuutata he to aawaaj nahin hoti, akaash kaa dil bhi tutaa tha
 Not only was he broken, but he started to feel that the girl is playing a game of deception with his heart
 or yahi is khooni khel kii sabase badi vajah ban gai
 Without knowing the girl's heart, Akash fell in love with her unilaterally, and then she attacked the same love in order to get the same unilateral love
 magar isse pehle usne chaar panne kaa ek note bhi likhaa
 In which all those things were told
 akaash ke aakhri maane jane vaale 4 pannon ke khat main ek ladke or ek ladki ke bich rishte kaa tanabana dikhaai de rahaa he lekin yahaan gaur karne vaali sabase ahm baat ye bhi he ki yahaan paksh ekatarfa yani sirf akaash kaa he
 Akash has undoubtedly tried to expose his relationship with his classmate studying in his own class through this letter, but the question remains whether even if someone's heart is broken then he or she is with someone else's life
 Such dangerous mess is justified
 fasebuk par bhi dikhaa tha akaash kaa dard
 
 
 'the lanyard of relationships is weakened when the person creates the answers to the questions arising out of misunderstanding
 
 
 ' aisi vajandaar baaten soshal netwarking site par aksar dikhti hai, lekin in baton ke peeche tuutate dil kii aahat bhala koun sunata he? lekin akaash ke is fasebuk states par uske doston ko ye aahat sunai de gai thi, lekin wo chaah kar bhi honi ko taal nahin sake
 On May 14, Akash Gupta, who killed his friend with an ax in the JNU campus, on his Facebook, 'relationship strings weaken when the human being answers the questions arising out of misunderstanding
 
 
 ' yahi states apadet kiya tha
 Then his friends had realized that the distance of his friend with him was constantly increasing, but even then no one had even thought that one day Akash would do everything, after which to say- Nothing will be left to listen
 kareebi doston ne tab akaash ko is haalat se nikalne ke liye samajhane kii bhi koshish kii thi, lekin akaash nahin samajha, or phir mangalvaar raat yaa buudhvaar kii subah usne chaar pannon main wo suicide note likhaa, jiske baad usne apane is rishte ke saath-saath jindagi bhi khatm karne kaa faisla kar liya

 Pakistani film actress Veena Malik, who is often seen in controversy, may or may not have shot a nude photo for an Indian magazine, but this time her fans seem ready to confront the defenders of morality in Pakistan
 vinaa ke prashansak unka jamkar samarthan kar rahe hai
 Having faced her negative image after appearing in the Indian reality show 'bigg Boss' last year, Veena has once again been mired in controversy over her nude photo on the homepage of FHM magazine
 is tasviir main nagn khadi vinaa kii baanh par ‘iesai’ likhaa tatu dikh rahaa he
 Veena refused to take this picture and threatened to file a case against the magazine
 iske jawaab main patrika ke sampadak kabir sharma ne kaha ki unke paas vinaa kaa ek video or imail he jisase is tasviir kii vishwasaneeyata sabit hoti he
 Pakistan's Home Minister Rehman Malik said that he had not seen these pictures
 haalanki unhone kaha ki agar vinaa ne yah photo shoot karaayi he to unke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 In contrast to the opposition of Rahman Malik, Pakistani women have come out in support of him in the virtual world
 sonia wahaab naam kii mahila ne ek web pej par likhaa he ki vinaa mujhe aap par garv he
 The best response in support of Veena is by the film directory Sharmine Obaid
 twitor par daale gaye ek post main obaid ne likhaa he ki vinaa par hamalaa bolne kaa intjaar kar rahe sabhi maulaviyon ko pehle apane liye yah bahaanaa taiyaar karnaa padegaa ki wo ethema main vinaa kii tasviir dekhne ke liye kyon line lagaakar intjaar kar rahe the
 Abdul Jabbar has written on the website of The Express Tribune newspaper that Veena has every right to take her photo in any way she wants
 misr ke ek blogar ne vinaa ke samarthan main likhaa he ki samaaj main ek mahila kaa mahatv is baat se nahin judaa he ki wo kitne zyada kapade pahane hoti he lekin samarthan ke alaava vinaa ko kuch logon kii virodhatmak pratikriya bhi mili he
 On a special Facebook page meant to show hatred for Indians, the page's administrator wrote that the shameless Veena Malik posed nude for the men's magazine FHM
 uske baanh par chapa ‘iesai’ tatu dekhie
 It symbolizes the hatred and anger of Indians towards ISI
 vinaa apane aap par shame karo
 Nearly 80 people, including those associated with this page, in their comments have demanded the Supreme Court of Pakistan to revoke Veena Malik's citizenship and ensure that Veena does not reside in Pakistan again
 vinaa kii yah nagn tasviir shuukravaar ko saarvajanik hone ke baad twitor par aa gayi thi
 Pakistani actress Meera protested to Veena saying that she is a completely crazy woman

 As soon as he became a minister, the dispute was not yet over with his Law Secretary to call a meeting of all the judges of Delhi that the case of presenting false facts in a Delhi court erupted like fire
 uske baad ek sisitivi footage saamne ai, jisamen ve dakshin dilli ke ek showrooms main raat main jaanch karne pahunch gaye, haalanki yah unke kaaryakshetra main nahin aata

" ”sutron kii maane to somnath bharti ko do-took kah diya gaya he ki apni bhashaa par niyantran rakhen

 In the same year, Bharti was named among the top 200 spammers in the world
 haalanki is bare main bharti kii ore se jo paksh media main rakhaa gaya, usamen daawa kiya gaya ki unke ek partner ne yah sari galati kii thi

 uttar pradesh sarkaar ne jab se faijabad jile kaa naam badal kar ayodhya rakhaa he, aise hi or jagahon ke naam badalane kii maangon kii baadh si aa gai he
 a similar demand has been made by Chandra Kumar Bose, a member of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's family and Bengal BJP vice-president
 bose ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bheji chitthee main kaha he ki netaji ko shradhanjali dene ke liye andaman or nicobar dweepasmooh kaa naam badal kar shahid or swaraj dweepasmooh kiya janaa chahie
 According to Bose, as the first PM of 'united Free India', Netaji hoisted the national flag on 30 December 1943 at Port Blair
 saath hi andaman or nicobar dweepasmooh main aaazaad hind sarkaar kii sthapana kii thi or is dweepasmooh kaa naam badalakar bhi shahid or swaraj dweepasmooh kar diya tha
 In his letter written on November 11, Chandra Kumar Bose said, "the Netaji, the chief of the Azad Hind government, unfurled the national flag and fulfilled his promise that by the end of 1943, the Azad Hind Fauj (INA) would stand on Indian soil
 ’ bose ne chitthee main likhaa, ‘29 disambar 1943 ko netaji andaman main port blair aiyaport par anand mohan sahay, captain ravat-edisi or netaji ke nijee physician karnal dies raju ke saath utre
 There he was strongly welcomed by the enthusiastic Indian citizens
 netaji ne indian neshnal army ke general e ji loganathan ko dweepasmooh kaa governor niyukt kiya
 Bose made this demand at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit the archipelago on the 75th anniversary of Netaji's historic visit in December
 yah bhi padhein: faijabad kaa naam badla, ab meet or sharaab kii bikri par bhi lag saktaa he bannbose ne piem ko likhaa he, ‘bharat 30 disambar 2018 ko netaji kii ore se kiye gaye dhwajarohan kii 75veen saalagirah manaane ja rahaa he
 It is very pleasant to know that you are going to fly the tricolor at the Gymkhana Grounds of Port Blair
 hamaare mahaan desh ke logon kii ore se maang he ki bharat sarkaar andaman or nicobar dweepasmooh kaa naam badal kar shahid or swaraj dweepasmooh kar diya janaa chahie, jaisaa ki netaji ne rakhaa tha
 It has been the demand of the people and it would be a fitting tribute to Netaji to do so before his birth anniversary in January
 hamen puri ummid he ki piem hamaari maang ko sunenge or andaman kii agle maheene yatra ke dauraan naam badalane kaa elaan karenge
 It has to be recognized the contribution of Azad Hind Fauj

 His enthusiasm spills over into words after paying the bill

 Encouraged by the Prime Minister's appeal to Khadi, the MP told the officer, "you knew, if elections are to be held in 2014, Khadi Bhandar should have already stated its demand so that there is timely supply
 ” is jawaab ke baad adhikari ne unki pasand ke mutabik sample bhejne kii hami bhar di

 Encouraged by this, Union Micro, Small and Medium Industries Minister Kalraj Mishra tells India Today, “the Prime Minister himself wanted Khadi to be promoted
 unhone sabase charchaa kii or tay hua ki agar ve khud apil karen to zyada prabhavi hoga
 "now, in view of the increasing craze towards Khadi, the Minister has decided to call a high-level review meeting so that the plans can be realized
" ve kehete hai ki khaadi ke vikaas ke liye paisa kharch kar rahe hai or bhi jarurat padegi to sarkaar peeche nahin hategi
 The Modi mantra to deliver Khadi in every house is a strategy to eliminate the concept that Khadi is only the dress of politicians
 modi ne iske liye janata se bhale apil kii he, lekin sarkaar kii ranneeti ise pehle upar se hi badhaava dene kii he
 For this, the proposal of Khadi Day is being pushed forward and a plan to make it mandatory for all officers and employees of the Central Government to wear Khadi apparel at least once a month, if not every week

 is combined with tax exemption, then the trend of people will move towards Indian apparel

 hamaari basen college or anya jagahon par ja rahi hai, jisamen kaaphi acchhee bikri ho rahi he
 The CEO of KVIC also states that Khadi Village Industries will actively participate in the Fest (events) held every year in colleges
 pehali baar khaadi par chaatro ko atirikt 5 fisadi kii vishesh chhot di gai he
 Earlier, special exemption was also given from International Youth Day on 12 August till 19 August

 The Sangh Parivar is happy with the way Modi has been strategically advancing its development agenda with symbols towards the Swadeshi model, while the Opposition is unable to find a cut
 swadeshi jaagran manch ke rashtriya sanyojak rah chuke or ab bijepi ke mahasachiv muralidhar raav kehete hai, “khaadi ke liye is tarah kii apil gandhi ji ke baad pehali baar kisi pradhanmantri ne kii he
 Khadi will get a boost after his call
 modi kii praathamikta swaavlamban ke saath deshi sansadhano se desh kaa vikaas rahaa he or unhen jaise hi mauka mila, us disha main kadam badha diya he
 "kalraj Mishra's top priority is to make Khadi an indigenous identity," says a senior official
 ” jis tarah modi ne upie sarkaar ke nirmal bharat abhiyaan ko swatchta mishan main badla or mek in india ke naare ko nayaa kalevar diya, mantralay main bhi is par vichaar ho rahaa he ki keviisi kaa naam swadeshi se jodakar rakhaa jaae
 So why is the Khadi Commission destitute? The Modi government may want to run a Swadeshi campaign on the lines of Gandhi through Khadi, but ironically the Khadi Village Industries Commission (KVIC) has been an orphan for almost three months
 abhi is sanstha main na to koi purnakalik siio he or na hi chairman
 According to the officials of the ministry, it will not be possible to speed up KVIC until a new CEO is appointed
 yah sthiti tab he jab sookshm, laghu tathaa madhyam udyog mantralay ke 2014-15 ke kul bajet 3,702
 08 crores Rs
 main akele keviisi kaa bajet 1,932 karod ru

 anil kumaar hi siio kii bhoomika main hai
 There is no possibility of being made chairman in the next few months and Kumar, who is still playing a double role, is likely to be given this responsibility
 haalanki mantralay main chairman or sadasyon ko chunane ko lekar screening kii prakriya jari he, lekin sutron kii maane to calraj gambhir duvidha main hai
 Sources claim that Kalraj has met Prime Minister Modi thrice regarding the commission, but he has been asked to appoint only after consulting someone in the Sangh Parivar
 sarkaar main keviisi ko lekar asamanjas bhi saaf taur par dikhataa he
 When the KVIC was dissolved on 24 July, the government order said to empower it with radical changes
 lekin ab mantri ho yaa sanyukt sachiv, amul-chul badlaav kii bajaae sirf nayaa ayog punargathit karne kii baat kar rahe hai
 Confusion about Khadi is about a big goal
 siio kaa kahana he ki pehle yah tay karnaa hoga ki khaadi ko kis str tak le janaa he kyonki ab yah tay karnaa hoga ki ise aam janata kaa kapadaa banaaya jaae yaa phir jaise linen aadi ke kapade hote hai
 Until recently, Devendra Bhai Desai, chairman of this commission, says, "according to Gandhiji's ideas, Khadi was not just a garment, a symbol of non-violence and a form of decentralization of the economy
 lekin maujuuda sarkaar khaadi ko sirf rojgaar ke rup main dekhati he
 Modi may accept Gandhi's views, but the officials involved in the policy decision do not understand the thinking of the common people about Khadi
 ”saaf he ki modi ko agar khaadi ko swadeshi brands ke taur par sthapit karnaa he to jamaane kii soch ke mutabik use badalanaa hoga

 [pic: Businessman Pradeep (in red kurta) with sons in police custody] a fortnight ago, when the Gwalior police searched and stopped a Tata safari at Basant Vihar, the city's posh colony, they had no idea that they had smuggled drugs like smack Will reach networks spread to other states
 is safari ko chalaa rahe pradeep shivahare ke paas se 382 gram smack mili
 After this, when the police raided Pradeep Shivhare's house located in the Goth of the state of Old Gwalior, about one kilo smack was recovered from the drawing room to the bathroom
 yah pehla mauka tha, jab shahari ilaake main nashile padaarthon kii ek badi khep baraamad kii gai
 This revealed that Gwalior is becoming a major center for narcotics supply
 darasal, drugs kaarobaari shivahare bhi nahin pakadaa jaataa, agar lashkar ilaake main kuch maheene pehle niyukt kii gayi dspi pratibha mathew ne jaanch karke maamle ko aage nahin badhaayaa hota
 The raid on Shivhare's house at 3:30 in the morning on 14 May was so secret that the local police station was not even involved, as the local policemen used to help Shivhare's business
 jab bhi police shivahare par karrwai karti, uske paas pehle se khabar pahunch jaati or makaan kii talaashi main kuch nahin miltaa tha
 After this, Shivhare ULTRA used to register a case of harassment against the police itself
 iske chalate sthaneey police bhi usase darati thi
 This is why Shivhare's drugs business has been flourishing for the past decade
 haalanki 14 may ko bhi shivahare parivaar ne toilet main smack bahaane kaa prayaas kiya, lekin ghar ke kamaron main rakhi 600 gram smack mil gai
 The police found evidence, so the threat of Shivhare did not work
 police ne is baar puri taiyaar ke saath chhapemari kii, varanaa use phir khaali haath lautnaa pad saktaa tha
 According to estimates, Shivhare has set up a smack hideout of over Rs 50 crore in a decade
 pradeep shivahare kaa puraa parivaar hi nashile kaarobaar main laga hua tha
 Smack has also been recovered from her daughter-in-law Geeta's room along with her two sons Amar and Ashish
 10 varsh pehle shivahare parivaar ganja or bhaang ke sarkari theke liya karata tha or baad main bear baar bhi chalaaya, lekin isamen munafa kam hota dekh vah nashile padaarthon kaa kaarobaar karne laga
 This business flourished so much that it started supplying smacks not only to Gwalior but also to the surrounding districts
 akele gwalior main hi shivahare ke 300 se zyada agent smack kii footkar main supplai karte the
 Whenever the police raided Shivhare's house and hotel, he would get the news beforehand and he would hide the smack
 isi varsh farvari main bhi police ne chapa maaraa tha to usne ghar main rakhi smack ko pani main milakar ghar main poncha lagava diya, jisase police ko khaali haath lautnaa padaa
 In this regard, Lashkar Circle CSP Pradeep Patel says that whenever he was raided on Shivhare's hideout, he could not get smack, but this time he could not hide, because he could not guess the action and smack a large amount from home
 Got it
 pichley ek varsh main hi gwalior police ke paas nashile padaarthon se jude 20 se zyada maamle darj hue, lekin shivahare jaisi badi machhlee ab jaakar haath lagi
 Earlier, the police used to sell or consume five or 10 grams of smack
 darasal, gwalior or chambal anchal kii seemaa do rajyon rajasthan or uttar pradesh se lagati he or isi vajah se yah ilaaka nashile padaarthon kii supplai kaa ek transit point bana hua he
 This is accepted by the police, but due to lack of coordination between the police of many districts, only sporadic cases arise
 isi tarah, malwa ke mandsaur ilaake main opium kaa ek product doda-chura gwalior or pradesh kii seemaa ke raste punjab tak pahunchataa he
 Several times, police seized a consignment of doda-chura on National Highway 3
 iske alaava chambal ke bhind jile ke gaanvon main smack bikati he
 a police officer says that the area's drug dealers have links with the smugglers of orai-jalaun in Bundelkhand, but the network is so large that it becomes difficult to get to the bottom
 ab police ke saamne yah chunauti he ki shivahare itani badi maatra main smack kahaan se lekar aata tha or koun log is nashile kaarobaar main uski madad karte the
 In particular, the identification of the policemen who used to help him has become necessary
 haalanki 15 din biit jane ke baad police jaanch kahaan tak pahunchi he, is bare main adhikari bataane ko taiyaar nahin hai

 Although all three films are completely different from each other, due to release on the same day, all three films may have to suffer loss
 to abhi se sochna shuru kar den ki aap inamen se koun-si film dekhenge! In this session, the government will introduce several important bills
 The government will also introduce a personal data protection bill
 The winter session of Parliament starts on November 18
 is satr main sarkaar kai ahm bill pesh karegi, jisamen naagarikta sanshodhan bill bhi hoga
 There has been a lot of opposition to this bill
 is vidheyak ke kanoon banane ke baad, afghanistan, bangladesh or pakistan ke hindu, sikh, buddha, jain, parsi or isai dharm ke maanane vaale alpsankhyak samudaayon ko 12 saal kii bajaay mahaj chah saal bharat main gujaarne or bina uchit dastavejon ke bhi bhartiya naagarikta mil sakegi
 The people of the Northeast protest that if this bill is passed, it will play with the cultural, linguistic and traditional heritage of the states
 kya he naagarikta sanshodhan bilanaagarikta sanshodhan bill hindu, sikh, buddha, jain, parsi va isaayiyon ko jo pakistan, afghanistan, bangladesh se bina vaid yatra dastavejon ke bharat aae hai, yaa jinke vaid dastavejon kii samay seemaa haal ke saalon main khatm ho gai he, unhen bhartiyanagariktaprapt karne ke liye sakasham banaata he
 The bill provides for the removal of obstacles for people of Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan from six non-muslim minority groups to gain Indian citizenship
 prastaavit vidheyakon kaa byorice bill ke khilaaf kaafivirodh pradarshanhue hai
 In the last session of Parliament, opposition parties unitedly opposed it
 uttar-purv ke kai rajya is vidheyak ke virodh main hai
 In view of this, the government has promised to amend it
 sheet satr main sansad patal par ise rakhaa jayega or sarkaar ise aasaani se paas kara lene kii ummid main he
 The Citizenship Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha in January 2019 but was not passed in Rajya Sabha
 iske baad loksabhaa bhang hone ke saath hi yah bill radd ho gaya
 Now once again the Modi government is bringing this bill but the way opposition parties are questioning this bill and it is being strongly opposed in the northeastern states, in such a situation, this bill will be repeated before the Modi government from both the houses
 Passing will be challenging
 sarkaar kaa aashwaasanakendriya grahamantri amit shah purvottar ke mul nivaasiyon se kah chuke hai ki ve prastaavit naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak ko lekar chintit na hon, kyonki isse unke adhikaar prabhavit nahin honge
 He said that three Chief Ministers of the Northeast have raised the issue of Citizenship Amendment Bill and expressed apprehension that the proposed law may curtail the rights of the native people
 shah ne kaha, naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak ke bare main chintaa karne kii jarurat nahin he
 This will not affect their rights
 vidheyakamein bangladesh sahit padosi deshon ke alpsankhyakon konaagariktadene kaa praavdhaan he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also repeated this assurance
 unhone kaha he ki centre yah sunshchit karne ke liye isamen kuch badlaav karegaa ki isse koi prabhavit na ho
 (input from agency) raksha mantri rajnath singh ne haal ke dinon main pakistan ke khilaaf apana rukh tikhe andaaj main jaahir kiya he
 He is considered soft, but his two blatant statements shocked people in just two days
 11 agast ko rajasthan ke pokaran main unhone parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa upyog pehle na karne kii bharat kii do-dashak puraani 'no first yuj' niti main sambhavit badlaav kii ore ishaara kiya
 Two days later, he said at a public rally in Haryana that if talks were held with Pakistan, it would be only on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (pok)
 vot kaa moolyabareli se bhaajapa saansad or kendriya shram va rojgaar mantri santosh kumaar gangavar ne kharaab iviem ke khilaaf vipaksh kii ore se kii ja rahi narebaaji main apana bhi sur milaate hue bareli ke jila magistrate ke samaksh shikaayat darj karai he ki bhaajapa ke majboot garh kaali baadi se unhen mahaj paanch vot kaise mil sakate hai? yah unke pratidwandvi rajya ke vitt mantri rajesh agarwal kaa kiya-dharaa he jo usee ilaake main rahete hai
 But his complaint is strange as he won the election by 1,67,282 votes
 rane kii mahimamaharashtra ke purv mukhyamantri narayan rane rajya ke chaar pramukh rajnatik dalon main se teen kaa hissaa rahe hai
 In his recently released Marathi autobiography Jhanjhwat, Rane, who is now in the BJP, described his 12-year tenure of the Congress (since 2005) as a cycle of fate
 unhone ensipi ke badale congress ko chunaa tha
 However, nobody argued this argument
 darasal, ensipi ke gurunath kulkarni rane ko dal main laane ke liye katai taiyaar nahin the
 Also, Rane wanted the post of Chief Minister, which was held by the Congress
 police ke paharedaarmadhya pradesh un chand bade rajyon main he jahaan police kamishnari pranali nahin he
 One reason for this is the IAS lobby of the state which is against giving more powers to the police
 haal main mukhyamantri kamalnath ne is mudde par vichaar karnaa shuru kiya jab ipies adhikariyon ne badhate aparaadhon kii ore unka dhyaan khinchaa
 There was speculation that there would be an announcement on 15 August
 par, aisa nahin hua or gatirodh jari he
 Obviously, IAS officers are benefiting
 dhwajarohan kii ichchhaagrih mantri amit shah 17 sitambar (purv riyasat, hyderabad, ke bhartiya sangh main shaamil hone kii varshganth) ko hyderabad main rashtriya dhvaj fahraana chaahate hai
 Since 2014, the state government has been instructing the BJP to hoist the flag inside its party headquarters
 jaahir he, rajya sarkaar rajdhani ke samvedansheel maahaul main kisi dhruvikaran ko nahin panpane dena chaahati thi
 Now the state government is in a dilemma as to how to convince Shah? —with Ashish Mishra, Amarnath

 The name is Krish
 dilli kaa punjabi he
 Have done b
tech from IIT Delhi
 ab im ahmedabad se emb karne pahunchaa he
 Is a girl
 naam ananyaa
 Is from Chennai
 ye bhi im main padhati he
 One day Madame Mess's Head Chef is raping the quality of sambar
 tabhi prakat hote hai krish
 They give their share of rasgulla to the girl and then the syrup begins to spread between them
 ananyaa dost ban jaati he or krish dosti kaa naatak karata he kyonki asal main pyaar karata he
 Then there is love
 magar dikkat ye he ki pyaar ke baad shaadi he
 Marriage, for which the families of both should meet and agree
 ek taraf hai punjabi
 On the other hand, in the words of those Punjabis, Madrasi
 donon apane pyaare bacchon kii shaadi apane armaanon ke mutabik karnaa chaahate hai
 In the context of India, it means in its own society and caste
 magar ye do pyaar ke panchi to koi or hi parwaaj bharne ko taiyaar hai
 Together, they have also decided that they will not run away and get married
 aise main shuru hota he jatan
 First Krish takes posting in Chennai to get the love of Ananya's family
 phir kila fatah hone ke baad ananyaa aati he dilli
 There are other types of problems here
 in sabake bich krish kaa ateet bhi he
 He has a serious confrontation with his father
 maa pyaar karti he, magar ye kabhi kabhi dam lene par utaaru ho jaataa he
 He feels that my innocent son has been implicated
 is fansaa kii jab fans nikalati he, to sab thik ho jaataa he
 You must have read this story in Chetan Bhagat's novel Two States
 film usee naam or nowell par aadhaarit he
 The story measures many curves of Indian society
 jati, dharm or kshetra ke bandhan
 Parents' expectations from children, which mostly mean their marriage and good daughter-in-law
 iske alaava karne kaa kuch or man he, kar kuch or rahe hai vaali akhil bhartiya kariyar samasya bhi munh baae khadi rahati he
 Chetan Bhagat has absorbed all these without boring
 film main arjuna kapur ne ek taraf pyaar, ek taraf parivaar or donon ko ek saath paa lene kii jaddojahad ko apni dehbhasha or jabaan se bakhubi nibhaayaa he
 But in front of his father, Ronit Roy, he falls weak in some frames
 koi baat nahin
 The boy has just got sowed
 aalia bhatta bhi ananyaa ke role main khubasurat or samvedansheel najar aati hai
 However, in terms of the character, he looks somewhat crude in some places
 vaise vah lagaataar achche role chun rahi hai or isliye unke prati ummiido kaa paara bhi lagaataar chadh rahaa he
 Apart from this, Amrita Singh and Ronit Roy play the roles of Krish's mother-father with great depth in the film
 revathi bhi kam bolkar or chehre ke sahare bhav nibhaakar apni acting range kaa bemisaal saboot detii hai
 The songs of the film are good and add a lot of color to the film
 vaise to locha e ulfat or offo khub popular ho rahe hai, magar mere favorit hai man mast magan or chandaniya
 Its lyrics also have deep meaning and melody is also very good
 punjabi shaadi vaale number se bachaa ja saktaa tha
 Director Abhishek Varman has done his work comfortably
 film kahin bhi apni raftaar nahin khoti
 There are plenty of shades in it and all leave their mark
 chetan bhagat ne film kaa screen play likhane main upanyaas kii aatma ko bakhubi bachaaya he
 But i also have a complaint
 thri edinuts se unhen kuch prerana leni chahie thi
 Had there been some elaboration and changes in the story about the original motif of the novel, the wings of hope would have been more even
 film tu stats sirf yuvaaon ke liye yaa multiplex audiyans ke liye hi nahin he
 Mummy-papa people must also see this
 ye ek badhiya tul sabit ho saktaa he unke liye, apane baad kii peedi kii aakankshaon ko samajhane kaa
 The film also brings out the intricacies of Indian society
 ladke kii maa he to akad hi rahegi yaa ladki he to use khaanaa bananaa aana hi chahie, jaise sthapit rivaajon ko film puri taralata or panepan ke saath aankh dikhaati he
 Go and enjoy the joy of watching a fantastic love story
 sarkaar ne saarvajanik mangneej ayask company moil limited kaa nirgam mulya aaj 375 rupee tay kiya jisase iske ipo se 1,260 karod rupee mil sakate hai
 The shares of MOIL Ltd are likely to be listed on 15 December
 vitt mantralay ke sutron ne bataaya,moil kaa har share 375 rupee prati share ke mulya par jari kiya jayega or company 15 disambar ko soochibaddh ho sakati he
 It is noteworthy that the government has sold its stake in a fifth government company this year
 sarkaar ne moil ke ipo kaa keemat dayera 340-375 rupee prati share tay kiya tha
 Its issue was subscribed 56 times
 sarkaar company main apni 10 pratishat hissedari bech rahi he
 The issue has once again come to the center of politics after the Supreme Court instructed to resolve the Ram temple case from outside the court
 court ne kaha he ki agar baatcheet se hal nahin nikalataa he to court madhyasthata ke liye taiyaar he
 The sage saints of Ayodhya have expressed happiness over this decision of the court and have said that they are ready to talk to the other side
 faisle par kya bole sant?dharmaguru vedanti ji ne is mudde par kaha ki pehle bhi court se baahar baatcheet kar maamle ko sulajhane kii koshish kii gai he, lekin is par safalataa nahin pai ja saki
 But the Babri Masjid Committee had talked about building the Babri Masjid at the same place, which could not be accepted
 santon ke anusaar, jahaan par ram lalaa kaa janm hua he, mandir vahiin bananaa chahie
 Sant Suresh Das, once again given the chance, says that even before the talks have not been resolved, but after the Supreme Court has said that once again the opportunity should be given
 agar baatcheet se hal nahin nikalataa he to court jane ke sivaay koi rasta nahin hoga
 He said that there is a BJP government at the Center, there is a majority in the Rajya Sabha and now there is also a BJP government in the state, if it wants, the temple can be built by making laws
 maanavtaa kaa sandesh jayegawahin ayodhya main dharmaguru rajendra das ne kaha kiraam mandir ke nirmaanse sampurna vishwa main maanavtaa kaa sandesh jayega
 He said that it would have been good to have the issue resolved by consensus, all the people should sit together and resolve it
 dharmaguru bole ki ummid he ki muslim varg ke log bhi is mudde par udaartaa dikhaate hue mudde kaa hal nikaalane main madad karenge
 Hindu organizations also welcomed The Supreme Court's comment has also been welcomed by all Hindu organizations
 vishwa hindu parishad ne kaha ki is mudde par donon pakshon ko aage bad kar baat kerani chahie
 Dattatreya Hosbole of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh will accept the matter of Dharma Sansad, after the Supreme Court's comment that whatever decision Dharmasansad will take, he will accept it
 gauratlab he ki mangalvaar ko supreme court niram mandirmasale par tippanee karte hue kaha tha ki donon paksh court ke baahar hi aapas main baatcheet ke dwaara is mudde ko sulajhaa len, agar zarurat padati he to court maamle main dakhal degaa
 At the same time, UP CM Yogi Adityanath had said that the UP government is ready to give all possible help on this issue
 sibiesai board (CBSE Board) kii parikshaayen shuru ho gai he
 Like maths, accountancy is also considered a difficult subject
 12veen kiacountency kii pariksha 6 march ko honi he
 Many times students are not able to get good numbers in accountancy even after good preparation
 jo students commers said se padhai kar rahe hai unke liye acountency main achche number laana jaruri bhi he
 The question of bringing good numbers in class 12 (CBSE Class 12) remains above all the students because on the basis of the marks of 12th, good college admission is given
 agar student acountency main tej he to vah aage chalakar sie kii taiyaari kar saktaa he
 Many career options are opened for those whose accountancy is good
 aise main aaj ham sibiesai ke students ko acountency ke paper kii taiyaari karne ke liye kuch tips de rahe hai, jinhen folon kar 12veen ke students 90 fisadi se zyada ank hasil kar sakate hai
 It is said that the feet of the pot are seen in the cradle
 tej gendbaaj jasprit bumraah ko lekar bhi aisi hi raay he
 The day he stepped into the Indian team, revived Indian fast bowling
 or ab ipel main dhooma machaai hui he
 On Saturday, Bumrah showed his future in the match played with Gujarat Lions
 unhone dikhaa diya ki deth overs main unhen maharath hasil he
 Only when the super overca number came after the match was tied, then the eyes and eyes of the captain and coach of Mumbai Indians also stayed on Bumrah
 rajkot ke maidan main ipel ke is sijan kaa pehla super over hua
 Mumbai Indians scored 11 runs batting first
 iske baad mumbai indiens kii gendbaaji kaa number aayaa to vichaar vimarsh hua
 Gujarat Nebrandon mccallum and Aaron Finchko came out to bat
 aise main mumbai indiens ke captain rohit sharma or team ke baaki senior members ke liye is baat kii chunauti thi ki ball kise thamai jaye
 However, Rohit Sharma did not take much time in this decision and expressed his trust in Jaspreet Bumrah
 dekhte rahe malingajis vakt super over main gendbaaji karaane ke liye rohit sharma maathapai kar rahe the, us vakt lasith malinga bahut hi shanti ke saath ye najaara dekh rahe the
 It might have been difficult for Malinga as well, as Malinga is considered to be the best bowler in the world who specializes in bowling at the Death Overs
 aakhri overs main bhi ran na dena or apni yorker se ballebaajon ko chakaana malinga kii khaasiyat rahi he
 But when the time came for the team to challenge on Saturday, the team relied on Jaspreet Bumrah to teach them their tricks instead
 malinga se siikhe hai bumrahavande ho yaa tii-20 match, bumraah apni dhardaar or sateek yorker ke liye jane jate hai
 At the same time, he is also adept at dodging batsmen from the Slower Yorker
 lekin aapako bataa den ki bumraah ne ye kala lasith malinga se hi sikhi he
 Bumrah had told in an interview that Lasith Malinga taught him to do Yorker
 bumraah ne kaha tha ki mushkil paristhitiyon menyorkarka istemaal kaise karen, ye malinga ne unhen bahut achche se sikhaaya
 In particular, he was instrumental in the introduction of the Slover Yorker
 bataa den ki jasprit bumraah 2013 se mumbai indiens ke saath khel rahe hai
 Malinga said - Jasprit Bumrah was congratulated by the entire team for bowling brilliantly in Shabashsuper over
 dag out main baithe lasith malinga bhi uthakar maidan main gaye or bumraah ko shandaar over ke liye unki peeth thapthapai
 Explain that despite giving a free hit Jaspreet Bumrah allowed only mccullum and Finch to score just 6 runs in the entire over
 jisaki badaulat romaanchak mukaable main mumbai indiens ne 5 ran se match jeet liya

 (input agenciyon se) When the Bill for 10% reservation for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) was passed in the Bihar Legislative Assembly on February 18, before the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav started his state-wide 'unemployment Hatao Reservation Extender' yatra They had completed the first phase

 It plans to create a divide between the backward and the forward in Bihar
 duusari ore bhaajapa-janata dal united (jadyu) kheme ko ummid he ki nayaa kota uske us 'puraane gathjod' ko phir se majboot kar degaa
 In this, forward castes, extremely backward castes (ebcs) and Dalits voted in favor of NDA from 2005 to 2013 in Bihar
 2013 main nitish kumaar ne bhaajapa se naata tod liya tha
 Says a senior BJP leader, "that was a great period of public confidence in us
" itnaa adhik ki musalamaanon ke kuch virgon ne bhi endie ko vot diya tha kyonki ve nitish ke shashan ke model ko pasand karte the
 But now the time has changed

 Not only this, the BJP hopes that Nitish's main support base, which includes non-yadav obcs, ebcs and Mahadalits, will stand with the NDA despite the EWS quota
 bihar main naukariyaan chaahe hon yaa na hon, aarakshan hameshaa se samvedansheel mudda rahaa he
 Under the leadership of Lalu Yadav, the RJD took full advantage in the 2015 assembly elections by raising the issue of reservation
 lalu prasad ne janata main yah dar paidaa kar diya tha ki centre ''aarakshan ko khatm karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 "some leaders of the rjd's upper castes also have the support of the partner Congress and they want the party not to oppose the EWS much but it does not seem to have any effect on the party leadership
" rajd ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''hamaara jor apane 14 pratishat yadav or 17 pratishat muslim vot ko ekajute karne ke alaava ibisi (29 pratishat) or essi (16 pratishat) ko saath jodgaye par he
 There is no use to please the forward castes (12 percent)
 ve party ke prati koi jhukaav nahin rakhti
 "because of this, the Congress stands in front of the religion because it is trying to strengthen its old support base of the Forward and the Muslims
" party ke pradesh adhyaksh madan mohan jha agadi jati ke hai
 As part of the alliance with the RJD and JDU in the 2015 assembly elections, the Congress fielded 16 upper-caste candidates, 12 of whom won
 rajd ko 2015 kaa pradarshan dohraane kii puri ummid he lekin nitish ke alag ho jane se yah aasaan nahin hoga
 a RJD leader admits, "this can happen when we can divide on caste lines
" agar 2014 ke aankadon par jaaen to bhaajapa, jadyu or lojpa kaa kul vot 50 pratishat se zyada baithta he
 If the Congress is worried, then the BJP is also no less worried

 Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the 7th Pay Commission

 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees have not received their direct benefits, the employees feel that the Pay Commission report has not been implemented yet
 ab tak 7wein vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lekar karmchaariyon kii naaraazgi ke baad uthe sawaalon ke samaadhaan ke liye sarkaar kii ore se teen samitiyon ke gathan kaa elaan kiya gaya tha

 We are trying to change this

 This time the railway budget will also be a part of the general budget
 aapako bataa den ki 1924 se rail bajet agal se pesh hota tha
 This time the country has expectations from Jaitley instead of Prabhu
 ummid he ki ve bhartiya rail kii tasviir badalane ke liye kuch khaas yojanaayen lekar aaenge
 Looking at the current condition of Indian Railways, there are five problems that need to be resolved immediately
 ajtak is khabar ke madhyam se vitt mantri arun jetali se apil karata he ki ve kam se kam bhartiya rail kii ye paanch tasviren hi badal den
 
 
 Waiting tickets have entered the digital age
 modi sarkaar bhi cashles arthvyavastha par jor de rahaa he
 But when you sit to book a railway ticket, a very lucky type of person gets a confirmed ticket
 adhiktar log vatting tikat hi book kar pate hai or yatra ke antim daur tak pienaar states check karte rahete hai
 To improve this, some schemes were run by the Railways, especially 'dynamic Fair' and Tatkal tickets
 tatkaal tikat par lakh paabandiyon ke baavjood aasaani se tikat hasil karnaa tedi kheer he jabaki dianmik fere pranali main yah aasaan he
 But it is so expensive that it is not suitable for the common man
 jetali aapse anurodh he ki koi aisi yojana laaen ki aam aadmi bhi immergency main railway kii behatar suvidha kaa istemaal kar sake
 Kahib 2 in the country via crowded Indian Railways
 5 karod log pratidin safar karte hai
 This is the reason why you get crowds on every occasion of rail journey
 sabase pehle tikat counter par, vatting room main, train main savaar hone ke liye (khaskar general dibbe), food stall par, pine vaale pani ke liye nalon tak lambii-lambii line lagi rahati he
 Jaitley ji appeals to you to do something that this crowd will be reduced
 train kii andruni vyavasthatrain main aap chadh gaye or agar aap kaa tikat vaataanukoolit shrenee kaa nahin he to aap safar nahin balki 'safar' karte hai
 The reason is old cans, dirt under the seats and dirty toilets
 aapako yahaan yah bhi bataa den ki bhartiya trainon main 1909 main pehali baar toilet kaa istemaal shuru hua tha
 Stations: Railway stations of India (except for some ISO certified stations) are places where you want to go only when you have helplessness
 stesan kii parkingon main gadiyon kaa or nikaas-pravesh get par jan samooh kaa kabja rahata he
 Apart from this, the amount of dirt that remains in the corners is different
 stesan par poochtacha counter par lage board thand ke dinon main logon ko hataash karte rahete hai
 Apart from this, the traveler also feels cheated in the food and drink items
 jetliji ummid he ki aap railway steshnon kii yah tasviir badalane kii bhi koshish karenge
 Safe rail travel After the last few days of ravaged rail accidents, the image of 'unsafe rail' has been seen in the public
 aamajan soshal media par apil kar chukaa he ki bullate train se pehle surakshit train bharat main aae
 For this, the Railways need to take concrete steps

 manmohan singh sarkaar jis artiai act par fakhr karti he wo hi ab ankhon kii kirakiri ban chuki he
 With the infighting of pranab-chidambaram, the Bhannai government has issued a circular to all states, ministries and departments
 isamen kaha gaya he ki artiai ke javaabon main jaldbaaji naa dikhaaen
 The threat posed by the UPA government in the pranab-chidambaram battle is the result of the RTI Act
 artiai ke jawaab main tuji par pranab mukherjee ke mantralay se ek note kya niklaa ek jinn banakar ghotaalaa puure sarkaar par mandaraane laga
 But now the break that the government has taken is no less surprising
 ajtak ke haath laga ye circular bataata he ki sarkaar ne ab artiai ko hi kuchalane kii taiyaari kar lee he
 On September 16, this circular issued by the Department of Personnel and Training of the government, citing the ruling of the Supreme Court, said that the information which is not part of the record of the public authority
 jo soochna kisi bhi tarah kanoon banaae rakhane main mushkil paidaa kar saktaa he
 Gathering that information and providing it to the applicant is not a compulsion
 saaf he sarkaar tamaam mahakamon ko samajha rahi he ki kaise saanp bhi mar jaae or lathi bhi naa toote
 But RTI activists and opposition are opposing it
 bhrashtachar kii jagah artiai ko hi kuchalane kii sarkaar kii taiyaari pranab da or pi chidambaram ke kalah ke tatkaal baad hi shuru ho gai thi

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator The Supreme Court has rejected the petition filed for Aadhaar linking, in which it was said that the deadline for linking Aadhaar to different services was raised
 iskaa matlab yah he ki philhal mobile number or bank acount aadhaar se link karne ke liye aapke paas 31 march tak kaa hi samay he
 a five-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Deepak Mishraki heard the matter
 is dauraan unhone aadhaar ke khilaaf darj yachikaaon kii pairvi kar rahe varisht vakil shyaam dewan kii ek yachika khaarij kar di
 However, the bench assured that everything will be taken care of during the hearing on the validity of the Aadhaar Act 2016
 supreme court ne kaha ki sunwaayee puri karte vakt aadhaar se jude sabhi muddon or pakshon kii baton par gaur kiya jayega
 Explain that in December last year, the government had said that the deadline for linking mobile number and bank account with Aadhaar should be made on 31 March
 iske baad aadhaar linking kii dedline 31 march kar di gai thi
 Earlier, the government has also told the Supreme Court that it is preparing to link the driving license with Aadhaar
 centre sarkaar ne supreme court ko ye jaankaree di ki sarkaar NIC sarathi 4 naam kaa system taiyaar kar rahi he
 It will keep a record of driving license holders across the country
 sabhi license aadhaar se link honge
 This will also eliminate the problem of fake licenses
 is system ke aane ke baad driver kii taraf se kiye gaye trephic ulanghan kaa bhi puraa byora kendriya record main hoga
 For this, it will not be necessary to punch the license
 sarkaar ne yah bhi saaf kiya tha ki aadhaar card comobile number, bank khate samet anya kai sarkari yojanaon se link karnaa anivaary jarur he, lekin saamaajik suraksha yojanaon kaa phayda uthaane ke liye aadhaar kii gairmaujuudagi main kisi or pahchaan patr kaa bhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, you can also show other documents including voter ID card

 In 2002, Karunanidhi warned the Maran brothers in the party's mouthpiece Muraosoli
 unhone likhaa, ''mere kandhon par khel kar bade hone waalon ne hi mere khilaaf talavaare taan di hai
 Even today my eyes become moist, when old memories come back

 Karunanidhi's political pace can be gauged from the fact that he won the assembly elections for the first time in 1957 and in 1969 he became the Chief Minister

 It is also considered important in terms of Mission 2014, even though political experts do not agree with Manmohan's bet

 The Supreme Court issued an interim order on April 12, refusing to ban the benami electoral bond scheme
 saath hi usne siyaasi dalon ko nirdesh diya ki ve aise bond ke jariye praapt daan kaa vivaran loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey ghoshit hone ke ek saptaah baad 30 may tak chunaav ayog ke paas ek silband lipaphe main jamaa karen
 That is, the voters will not have the information of the donors before the election
 supreme court ne yachikakartaon—sipiem or association of democratic riforms—kii maang ko khaarij kar diya
 The petitioners wanted the names of the electoral bond donors to be made public to ensure transparency in the election process
 yah yachika pichley saal chunavi bond yojana ke launch ke turant baad daali gai thi
 The petitioners sought interim measures from the Supreme Court on the basis that the sale of these unnamed bonds at a particular time is benefiting a particular party as most of the bonds are being purchased for the same party
 isse chunavi pratispardhaa main barabari kaa maahaul nahin banataa
 However, the Supreme Court asserted that if the identity of the buyers of electoral bonds is not disclosed, the government's efforts to control black money in the elections will fail
 supreme court ne antim faisla nahin sunaaya he kyonki chif justise ranjan gogoi kii raay thi ki aise 'mahatvapurn' mudde par charchaa ke liye zyada samay or tarkon kii jarurat he
 Some experts have called the court's order ironic
 unka maananaa he ki chunavi funding main paardarshita kii maang vaali yachika ke jawaab main adaalat ne siyaasi dalon ko 'silband lipaphe' ke jariye batch nikalne kaa kavach thama diya he
 Advocate Gautam Bhatia says, "sadly, in response to the plea of the public which was filed to know where the money is coming from political parties, the court said that this information is a Seal should be given in the cover and it should not reach the public
 ''zyada hairaani kii baat yah he ki adaalat ne bhartiya state bank (esbiai) ko vivaran pesh karne ke liye nahin kaha, jo in bondon kaa ekmaatr sangrakshak he
 He can now say that political parties have received these bonds secretly and do not know the names of the donors as their names are not recorded on the bonds
 yachikakartaon ne adaalat se anurodh kiya tha ki vah esbiai ko bond ke vivaran kaa khulaasa karne kaa aadesh de
 An individual, group of people or a corporate can purchase electoral bonds from designated branches of SBI within the first 10 days of every month
 15 dinon kii vaidhata vaale bond 1,000 rupye, 10,000 rupye, ek lakh rupye, 10 lakh rupye or ek karod rupye ke gunakon main jari kiye jate hai
 These bonds cannot be purchased in cash and the buyer has to submit a KYC (know Your Customer) form to the bank
 siyaasi dal esbiai ke apane khaaton ke jariye bond ko bhunaa sakate hai
 The donor is not required to tell which party he has donated these bonds to and to whom the party has received these bonds
 esbiai ne beete teen maheenon main 1,716 karod rupye ke chunavi bond beche hai, jo 2018 main bike 1,056 karod rupye ke bond se zyada hai
 94 of the total electoral bonds sold, as per the previous fiscal year grant report
 5 fisad mulya ke bond bhaajapa ko mili the
 Says Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala, "the code of secrecy in electoral bonds ensures that only the ruling party will be aware of how much a person or company has donated to which party
 natijatan, log keval sattadhari dal ko hi daan karenge
 Just before the launch of the scheme, the Election Commission had expressed its concerns about electoral bonds, saying that these bonds reduce transparency in political funding
 adaalat main daayar ek halafname main ayog ne kaha he ki chunavi bond ''siyaasi dalon ke saath-saath bhartiya companiyon or videshi companiyon ke liye betahasha benami korporate daan ke raste khol degaa
 Its consequences can be severe for Indian democracy

 vitt mantri arun jetali ne bajet main shiksha ko lekar kai elaan kiye hai
 In which Jaitley emphasized on education policy from nursery to 12th, now that an education policy will be made from pre-nursery to 12th
 unhone aage kaha acchhee shiksha ke liye sirf baccho ko bacchon ko skool tak bhejnaa kaaphi nahin he
 There is a need to improve the quality of teachers for better education
 jiske liye sarkaar adhyapakon ke liye training program chalaaegi or technology ke madhyam se shikshakon ko training di jaaegi
 Today the quality of education is a matter of grave concern
 jise dhyaan main rakhte hue sarkaar pre - nursery se 12veen class tak ek hi shiksha niti bana rahi he
 At the same time, due to this decision of the government, the arbitrariness of private schools can be curbed

 Jaitley said that at present there is a need to improve the quality of teachers

 In such a situation, students can get a lot of benefit by having a single education policy
 haalanki shiksha kii is nai niti se chaatro kaa kitna phayda hoga or kitna nuksaan ye kahana abhi mushkil he
 But this decision is expected to raise the level of quality in education

 However, during the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to America in the first week of June this year, his remarks regarding the idols here became a matter of discussion
 soshal media par modi kii khaasi aalochana hui
 Modi was ridiculed for describing the Sun Temple as 2,000 years old
 yah mandir vaise 766 saal purana he
 But whatever, the Sun Temple of Konark once again came under discussion
 vah mandir jisaki bhavyata ko dekhne 6,000 videshiyon samet 28 lakh se zyada paryatak har saal yahaan aate hai
 But even these tourists probably do not know the fact that in the main pavilion part of Suryadev, Parinda is not even able to kill, there is no question of anyone going there for darshan

 Seeing the temple deteriorating due to numerous attacks and natural disasters in the Mughal period, in 1901 the then Governor John Woodburn raised the walls at the four doors of the Jagmohan pavilion and it was completely filled with sand

 However, in 1994, a study by Italian architect and UNESCO consultant Professor Giorgio Crosi found that the condition of the said pavilion was probably not as dangerous as it was supposed to be

 "pichley dinon konark aae ees ke mahanideshak dow
 Rakesh Tiwari also said that there were good signs of endoscopy, but a final report was awaited

 On receipt of the report, it will be referred to two other expert committees

 According to asi's Bengal and Odisha Circle chief Ashok Patel, the archeology department is also ascertaining which parts are weak and which are strong within the Jagmohan pavilion
