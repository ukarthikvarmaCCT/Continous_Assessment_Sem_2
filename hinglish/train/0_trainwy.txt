 In the Rajya Sabha, BJP and BSP strongly targeted Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal on the pretext of discussing the issue of higher education and quipped on his Hindi and history knowledge
 saath hi ramlila maidan kaa bhi paroksh dhang se zikr kiya gaya
 bjp's Rajiv Pratap Rudy took part in Sibal's earlier statement about Champaran while participating in a half-hour discussion on the issue of higher education
 unhone daawa kiya ki mantri ko champaran ke aitihaasik mahatv ke bare main pataa nahin he
 Rudy said that Sibal had earlier said in the same house that there is no air, rail or road connectivity in Champaran, so it would not be appropriate to build a Central University there
 unhone kaha, ‘lagata he mantriji ko yaa to adhikariyon ne dhang se brifing nahin di
 Or they were more busy
 unhen ramlila maidan (hajaare andolan) kii samasyaayein bhi sulajhane kaa prayaas karnaa padataa he
 The BJP leader, after referring to the correspondence between Sibal and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar regarding the Central University, said that Sibal probably did not pay much attention to those letters because they were in Hindi
 unhone kaha, ‘yadi mantriji kehete to ham un patron kaa angreji main anuwaad karvaa dete
 Taking part in the discussion, Naresh Chandra Aggarwal of BSP drew attention to Sibal for the extremely low number of central universities in Uttar Pradesh in view of abadi and said that the Chief Minister of the state would also give him more financial assistance in the matter of education
 Has written many letters
 lekin ve patr bhi hindi main likhe gayi the shaayad isiilie un par zyada dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 Pointing to the various assurances given by Sibal, he said, "if you keep making similar announcements, the credibility of the government will fall
" ramlila maidan main bheed badhati jaayegi
 Responding to the discussion, Sibal said, 'I want to openly admit that i neither know good Hindi nor good English
 meraa itihaas gyaan bhi acha nahin he
 It is a matter of fact that i used to teach modern history at Delhi University

 In 2001, he was elected head of the village while in jail in a murder case

 Now former CBI joint director Upen Biswas, who is also a cabinet minister in the Mamata cabinet, has been appointed by Mamata Banerjee as an advisor to the party and government on the Sharda scam
 iskaa matlab he ki vah party or sarkaar kii ghotaale ke mudde par kya niti honi chahie or sibiai ke kadamon kaa kaise jawaab dena chahie, uski ranneeti taiyaar karenge
 How meaningful it will be, it will be known in the coming days, but yes, one thing is clear from this announcement that the Trinamool has been assuming that the party's policy has failed for the last two years and neither in public it will Could believe that its leaders are being sent to jail by the CBI one after the other due to the conspiracy of the Center
 vahiin jo saboot sibiai ke paas hai, uskaa tarksangat jawaab party na to jaanch agenciyon ko de rahi he or na hi apane party kaaryakartaaon ko
 Mukul Roy admitted in Delhi two days ago that he had been meeting with Saradha's doer Sudipto Sen, leading the party to believe that the party had suffered more, but if the CBI, like other party leaders, If Mukul Roy is also taken into custody after interrogation, not only the party but also the morale of the party workers will be adversely affected

 The reason for conducting a CBI investigation is that the court also said that the bank accounts of the temple should be immediately freeze and the trustees of the temple should not be able to withdraw any money
 darasal hai court ne ye CBI jaanch isliye baithai he kyonki dilli police se lekar PWD or didie se lekaramsiditak koi bhi agency 1995 se abtak kaa adhikariyon kaa lekha jokha nahin de pai, jinke vakt main is mandir or hanuman pratimaa ko banane kaa kaam hua
 The idea of making the statue airlift was extremely displeasing to the fact that the agency whose job it was to stop the encroachment on public land was the one who allowed the construction of the temple to be continued by encouraging corruption
 isse pehle dilli hai court tamaam agency se yah bhi puch chukaa he ki kya isahanuman pratimaa ko air liftkara kar kisi duusari jagah shift kiya ja saktaa he yaa nahin
 The case related to traffic jam, in fact the case is related to encroachment and traffic jam

 To save Delhi from future water crisis, the Aam Aadmi Party government will store rain water
 mangalvaar ko dilli sarkaar kii cabinet meeting main yamuna flud plane main pani ke sanchayan kaa kaam shuru karne ke prastaav ko manjuuri di
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has claimed to recharge ground water in Delhi at the Delhi Secretariat
 arvind kejariwal ne cabinet main hue faisle ke bare main bataate hue kaha ki puri duniya main pani kii baari kami ho rahi he
 In different parts of the country, one can hear about the acute shortage of water
 dilli ke bare main sunne ko miltaa he ki yahaan underground water kii sthiti dhire-dhire kharaab ho rahi he
 In view of all those circumstances and keeping in mind the future, the Delhi government has made a very big plan to store the water of Yamuna in the Yamuna Flood Plain
 isse maujuuda vakt main pani kii kami ko dur karne ke saath-saath bhavishya ke jal sankat se nipatane main bhi madad milegi
 The proposal has been approved by the Delhi Cabinet today
 pani sanchayan ke liye arvind kejariwal kaa daawa ki aane vaali barish main yamuna flud plane main pani ke sanchayan kaa or ground water richarge kaa kaam shuru kar diya jayega
 This time the time is short, yet it will be a solid start
 isse ye bhi pataa chal jayega ki is project kii sambhaavnaaen kitni hai
 Its result will be able to know how wide its possibilities are
 kansaltents or iaiti kii report is ore sanket karti hai ki is project main bahut vyapak sambhaavnaaen hai
 The flood plane of the Yamuna is very large
 isamen bahut pani sanchayan kii kshamta he
 By doing this Delhi's water crisis can be overcome
 is baar ham chote scale par shuru karenge
 Based on its study, it will be fully implemented next year
 dilli sarkaar ke mutabik, is yojana ke tahat pallaa se lekar wazirabad tak ke stretch ke kinaaron par pani kaa sanchayan kiya jayega
 It will be completely eco friendly
 isamen koi cement kaa strecchar nahin hoga
 Small ponds will be made in it
 in ponds main jab reglur yamuna kaa flo hoga, tab pani nahin pahonchega
 When the Yamuna overflows during the rainy days, then this overflowing water will go into these ponds
 jab ye pani yahaan thodi der tehregaa, tab neeche parculet ho jayega
 When the water flows into the Yamuna, it does not get time to percolate down, but when the water stops in those ponds for a while, the bottom will be percolated
 is baar hamen parkulation kaa rate pataa chal jayega
 We will also know how far this water will go down
 arvind kejariwal ne aage bataaya ki dilli main acchhee baat ye he ki yahaan pani kaa neeche kaa slop yamuna se shahar kii taraf aa rahaa he
 We would not have been able to store water if this slope would have turned upside down, for example, from the city towards Yamuna
 tab to shahar kaa pani bhi yamuna main bah jaataa
 The amount of water we store will be stored downstream towards the city
 ye pani kahaan-kahaan store hoga, ye hamen kansaltent ne bataaya he
 The Delhi government will need the approval of the central government for the new project
 is bare main bataate hue kejariwal ne kaha ki main khud kendriya jal shakti mantri gajendra shekhavat se milakar aayaa tha
 He was very positive about this project
 hamane usne nivedan kiya tha ki barish aani vaali he isliye is prastaav par jaldi nirnay le liya jaae
 He also assured that a decision will be taken soon
 hamen ummid he ki is project par hamen jaldi hi centre se manjuuri mil jaaegi
 Apart from this, where the Delhi government wants to store water, the land belongs to the farmers
 dilli sarkaar kisaanon kii jaminen kiraaye par legi
 The government has formed a committee of five officers to fix these fares
 ye cameti somvaar tak apni report de degi
 The government hopes that its pilot project will start before the rain
 aise hoga pani kaa sanchayservind kejariwal ne bataaya ki is yojana ke tahat nadi kinare keval ponds banane hai
 He said that the Yamuna Flood Plain is a very large natural reservoir
 agar aap cement kaa itnaa bada jalashay banaaenge to usamen hajaaron karod rupaye lagenge
 In this project, we only have to dig the pit
 ponds main pani aayega or rukegaa or phir parculet ho jayega
 This water will run for several km in the city without going down the pipeline
 iske baad hamen jahaan-jahaan pataa chalegaa ki pani rukegaa, vahaan ham borwell karke pani nikaal lenge
 Apart from this, the Delhi cabinet has decided to build rain water harvesting structures above all the buildings of the Delhi government
 saath hi sarkaar ne nirdesh jari kiye hai ki jin buildings par pehle se hi rain water harvesting strecchar hai, unki safai kar oparational kiya jaae

 Whereas reservation should be given only to those who have Khatian before 1932 or earlier

 isse bijepi vot khinchne vaali mashin main badal gai
 "nearly one-third of India voted for the BJP and eliminated it from being" untouchable "due to the fanatics of hardline Hindutva
 haalanki uske paksh main yah badlaav mukhya taur par uske vikaas or sushasan ke daavon se hua lekin sahyogiyon se haath milaane kii koshishon ne bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa kii
 The BJP gathered 28 allies in the NDA
 haalanki inamen se chah kii hi maujuudagi loksabhaa main he
 "most of them were not expected to win more than one seat," says party spokesperson Prakash Javadekar
 ranneeti yah thi ki in partiyon ke vot bank ko bijepi kii ore khinchaa jaae
 "this strategy worked in many ways
 bihar main lok janashakti party paswan voton ko khinchne main madadgaar hui, jinaki taadaad rajya kii sabhi 40 siton main kareeb 50,000 he
 Smaller allies in Tamil Nadu helped draw votes from communities like Vanniyar and Moopanar
 uttar pradesh main apana dal se gathjod ke kaaran rajya ke purvi hisse kii kai siton par kareeb ek lakh votaron kaa sahyog mil gaya
 This helped BJP to mobilize powerful castes in areas where its organizational base is weak
 bijepi ke ek netaa kehete hai, ‘‘party ke prachaar abhiyaan kaa model chunaav ke dauraan kaaryakartaaon ko ek rajya se duusare main bhejne kii rahi he
 Therefore local connectivity may be a problem
 gathbandhan kii sabhi partiyaan bhale is baar siten nahin jeet pain hai, lekin bhavishya main ye partiyaan madadgaar ho sakati hai
 Keeping the Hindutva agenda aside during the campaign, the BJP prepared the ground for a larger NDA and kept the door open for more allies after the election
 jabaki sarkaar banane main unke samarthan kii darkaar nahin bhi he
 The new allies can also compensate to some extent of lack of data in the Rajya Sabha, where the NDA has only 64 members out of 245
 rajyasabha main vampanthi dalon, bispi, trinmul congress or eidmke jaisi partiyon ke 96 sadsy hai, jinka sahyog mahatvapurn vidheyakon ko paarit karaane ke liye hasil karnaa jaruri hoga
 Modi said in a TV interview on May 7, "politics does not run on the basis of what is said in the election campaign
 ’’ is tarah unhone sanket diya ki ve un partiyon kaa bhi sahyog lene ko taiyaar hai jinaki prachaar ke dauraan aalochana kii he
 Modi is preparing for a big change in the BJP, strengthened by the mandate given to him
 prachaar ke dauraan mukhya bhoomika main rahe rajnath singh, arun jetali or amit shah satta ke nae centre honge
 However, Jaitley lost the Amritsar seat to Congress' Amarinder Singh
 jabaki shah kaa kad uttar pradesh main baari jeet dilwane se kaaphi bad gaya he
 When they were launched in the state 11 months ago, the BJP had a total of 10 seats and the workers were demoralized
 ab vahaan 71 siten hai jo 1998 main jiti sarvaadhik 57 siton (kul 85 main) se bhi zyada hai
 Therefore, his role will be important in bjp's change
 sutron ke mutabik, modi pehle mahasachiv (sanghathan) ke bare main faisle lenge, jo bijepi or aresas ke bich sethu kaa kaam karte hai
 This post is still with Ramlal and Modi once held this post
 modi party kii sarvocch niti nirdharak sanstha sansadeey board main apekshaakrit yuva netaaon ko laaenge or unhen mahasachiv kaa pad dekar is saal hone vaale maharashtra or haryana chunaavon kii jimmedaari saunpenge
 They will also increase the proportion of women in the party and will also create a new Muslim leadership to change the course of minority politics
 brands ranneetikaar susheel pandit kehete hai, ‘‘raashtrapati style prachaar chalaa chuke modi raashtrapati pranali jaisi sarkaar hi chalaayenge
 "this means we will maintain a strong hold on the party and the government
" shiromani akali dal ke naresh gujral kehete hai, ‘‘mantriyon kii niyukti piem karenge, ve mukhyamantriyon yaa party pramukhon ke pratinidhi nahin honge
 The PM will not have the compulsion of the prescribed quota of the alliance
 ’’hindu rashtrawaad par kaaphi likhane vaale francisi raajnneeti vigyaani christoff jaifarlo ke mutabik modi bijepi yaa aresas ke kaaryakartaaon par nirbharta kam karne ke liye ek samanaantar tantra khadaa kar sakate hai
 Senior leaders can make the situation difficult, but like Gujarat, Modi will not allow the Prime Minister's Office to have a relationship with the party
 adhikansh majboot mukhyamantriyon kii tarah ve apane rosemara ke kaam ke liye afasarshahon kii toli par bharosa karenge
 In this way, the PMO and the Cabinet Secretariat are expected to be strengthened
 modi apane vafaadaar afasaron ko gujarat se dilli laa sakate hai
 These include his principal secretary K
K
 kailashnath or atirikt pramukh sachiv e
 K
 sharma ho sakate hai
 Hold on the family How much will this change in the BJP appeal to the Sangh? This question will be important for Modi in the first few months of the government
 aresas ne unke peeche apni puri takat laga di he or unki jeet main lagaae apane kaaryakartaaon kii keemat vasuul saktaa he
 In 1999, Atal Bihari Vajpayee struggled to overcome the RSS, especially in the history books of glorifying his heroes
 sangh par tippanee karne vaale jyotirmaya sharma kaa kahana he ki bijepi-aresas kaa rishta behatar hoga
 He says, "earlier there was a difference between the two when politics was considered as a medium of social change
 lekin mohan bhagwat ke netritv main sangh ko raajnneeti se parhez nahin he
 Modi and Bhagwat are almost the same age and on the same ideological plane, so there will be a new type of relationship between the BJP and the Sangh
 ’’ sharma kehete hai, ‘‘aresas ab bhi pathyapustakon ko phir se likhane or samaan naagarik samhita main yakeen rakhata he lekin in maamalon ko vah shanti se nibata legaa
 "however, elections have been won, so Modi will also bring Gujarat's administrative clarity to the center
" iske liye pehle bijepi ko aisi shakl deni hogi, jo kargar sarkaar main madadgaar ho
 If Modi and the RSS plan to stay in power for long, they will have to find ways to make the Gujarat model effective and bring the work culture of the new secretariat in Gandhinagar to South Block in Delhi
 bollywood abhinetri kangana ranut kaa kahana he ki varsh 2016 kai utaar-chadhaavon vaala parikshaon se bharaa saal rahaa or unhen khushi he ki yah ab khatm hone ko he
 Despite no film release this year, Kangana remained in discussions due to a dispute with Hrithik Roshan in her personal life
 ‘queen’ abhinetri dwaara sanket main ruthik ko apana ‘sili eks’ bataane ke baad se hi donon kalakaaron ke bich vivaad jari he
 His dispute with Hrithik was further heightened after the case took legal form
 kangana ne somvaar raat patrakaron se kaha, ‘yah saal mere liye kaaphi utaar-chadhaav bharaa tha
 On many levels it has been quite awe-inspiring, in many cases it has been a lot of examinations, but trust me i am quite happy now that it is coming to an end
 ’ abhinetri ne kaha ki unki nijee jindagi se jude vivaadon ko chhod den to unhen unki aane vaali film ‘rangoon’ main kaaphi pechida kirdaar nibhaane kaa mauka mila
 He said, 'this is a year, i am waiting for it to end, as i said it was a lot of examinations both at the personal and professional level
 mujhe un pareshaaniyon kaa dat kar saamana karnaa tha jinamein main ghiri thi
 Julia (her character in the film Rangoon) was the most difficult character in my life
 yah sabase chunauteepurn kirdaar tha
 It was full of considerable examinations on many levels
 main khush hum ki ham varsh 2017 kii ore bad rahe hai
 The actress was speaking at the release ceremony of Bondina Ellangbaum's book Between the Poet and Her Pencil
 gauratlab he ki ruthik se jude maamle main lagaataar aarope-pratyarope kaa daur chalata rahaa, lekin kangana hameshaa hi aise koi bhi bayaan se bachati raheen jisase khud un par aanch aa sake
 During a recent event, when Kangana was asked questions regarding this case, she very deftly put her side and faced the questions
 unhone kaha, 'us vakt mujhe aisa mahasoos ho rahaa tha, jaise main duniya ke saamne neced (beparda) ho gai hum
 i have spent many nights crying in my room
 mere bare main bhaddi baaten kii ja rahi thim
 i became a joke in my circle of friends
 log meraa majaak uda rahe the
 Even today my friends always speak on this issue, but i have never answered anything
 main kisi bhi tarah vivaad ko badhanaa nahin chaahati thi
 Now i feel alive
 ' tippaniyan Hrithik was recently seen in the movie 'mohan Jodaro'
 ab vah apni agali film 'kaabil' kii taiyaari main hai, jo agle saal janvari main relies hogi
 At the same time, Kangana has won the National Award thrice
 is baar unhen unki film 'tanu vaids manu riterns' ke liye yah puraskaar diya gaya tha
 Kangana will now be seen in Vishal Bhardwaj's film 'rangoon'
 (input agenciyon se bhi) Kangna told reporters on Monday night, 'this year was very volatile for me
 kai staron par yah kaaphi abhibhoot karne vaala rahaa, kai maamalon main kaaphi parikshaon bharaa, lekin vishwaas kariye main ab kaaphi khush hum ki yah khatm ho rahaa he
 The actress said that leaving aside the controversies related to her personal life, she got a chance to play a very complex character in her upcoming film 'rangoon'
 unhone kaha, ‘yah ek aisa varsh he, main jiske khatm hone kaa intjaar kar rahi hum, jaisaa ki maine kaha ki nijee or peshewar donon str par yah kaaphi parikshaon bharaa rahaa
 i had to face the problems in which i was surrounded

 Significantly, in the case related to Hrithik, there was a continuous period of accusation, but Kangana always kept away from any such statement which could hit her
 haal hi main ek event ke dauraan jab is cese ke sambandh main kangana se sawaal puche gaye to unhone bahut bebaaki se apana paksh rakhaa or sawaalon kaa samaanaa kiya
 He said, 'at that time i felt as if i have become naked (unmasked) in front of the world
 kai raaten maine apane kamare main rote hue bitaai hai
 Bad things were being said about me
 apane doston ke sarkal main hi main majaak ban gai thi
 People were making fun of me
 aaj bhi is mudde par mere frends kabhi bhi bol dete hai, lekin maine kabhi kisi baat kaa jawaab nahin diya
 i did not want to escalate the dispute in any way
 ab main khud ko jeeta hua mahasoos karti hum

 Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan has shared an interesting anecdote related to his childhood
 unhone bataaya ki do saal kii umr main jab wo pehali baar railway plateform par gaye the to kaise apane mata pita se bhatak kar unase dur chale gaye or unki is harakat kii vajah se mata pita ko kaaphi der tak pareshaan hui
 Actually, Amitabh has done a video for railway cleanliness and safety
 amitabh bachchan"ek safar rail ke saath" naam ke is video ko central railway ne utyub par jari kiya he
 Amitabh told, “I had a different attachment to rail since childhood
 do saal kaa tha main
 When Ma came to the station for the first time with Babuji
 nanaaji ko milakar ham stesan par pahunche
 Mother put my hand in Babuji's hands and she went to buy tickets
 meraa dhyaan stesan par aati trainon par tha
 Gujarati trains were wooing me from the tracks
 na jane kab babuji kaa haath chhudaakar, seedhiyaan chadhakar brij par jaakar khadaa ho gaya main
 "parents were upset for fifteen minutes" Here Babuji thought that i had gone towards the ticket home with the mother
 isliye babuji bhi tikat ghar ke paas gaye or maa se mere bare main poocha
 She was terrified on hearing Babuji's question
 wo donon pandrah minute tak mujhe dhundte rahe, tabhi kisi ne unhen aakar kaha ki ek do saal kaa baccha brij par akele hi khadaa he
 Both run towards the bridge
 main neeche aati jaati trainon ko dekhne main khoyaa hua tha
 Seeing me there, both of them breathed a sigh of relief
 "ab chaahakar bhi mumkin nahin safar"aaj itane saalon ke baad bhi mujhe in trainon ko dekhnaa utana hi pasand he jitna tab tha
 In the early stages of my career, i have traveled many times in the local trains of Mumbai
 haalanki ab chaahakar bhi rail se safar mumkin nahin ho paata
 But many artists technicians of our film industry travel on a local train daily
 or shaayad yahi vajah he ki ham apni shooting samay par kar pate hai
 "sholay porter associated with memories" i have many memories associated with rail
 sholefilm kaa chalati train main filmaaya gaya fite seen,kulifilm ke dauraan rail plateform par hui shooting
 They all had different fun
 meri tarah aapaki kai yaaden rail se jarur judi hongi
 The way we keep our memories in our hearts and not the same, we should also keep every property connected with the Indian Railways
 ye ham sab kaa kartavya he
 "the responsibility of the rail is our responsibility," Amitabh said, "this railway property is ours
 yaad rakhie hamen milakar ise sanbhaalanaa he
 i have a request for you dekhie safar ke dauraan train main yaa rail parisar main gandagi na failaae or yatra ke dauraan suraksha niyamon kaa paalan kariye
 So let's raise hands together
 ek safar railway ke saath
 "let us tell you that Amitabh is busy in Season 10 of the popular TV show Kaun Banega Crorepati

 India's telecom company Vodafone Idea has announced to give free Netflix subscriptions for a year to some users
 ye ek nayaa ofer he jiske tahat Netflix ne samsung ke saath partnership kii he
 If you are buying Galaxy S10, Galaxy S10 Plus or Galaxy S10e then you can take advantage of this
 agar aap in teenon main se koi smartphone kharidenge to aap is ofer ke liye yogya he
 But it has a screw
 kyonki aise agar kisi bhi shop yaa i-commers company se ye divaais khariden to aapako ye ofer nahin milegaa
 For free Netflix for 1 year, you will have to purchase from Vodafone's website or My Vodafone app
 gauratlab he ki kisi telecom company se smartphone kharidne kaa matlab ye he ki aapako us telecom operators ke plan bhi lene hote he

 bakar puraana kii aamad isi kadi main jaan padati he
 Bakar Purana has been called a bachelor satire by its author-publisher

 This book usually has about 47 episodes involving youth
 shuruyaat cinema se hoti he
 In the context of the common man, when the cinema goes, the writer has tried to bring out the irrationality of single screen cinema hall goers, especially the youth, in the form of satire
 kaise ve baton-baton main bahes-jhagada, dhakka-mukki karte hai or drishyon ke dauraan caments kar maje karte hai
 Then why does this happen in Hindi films, the article has written about the recurring trends especially in the '90s Bollywood masala films, how they usually used to be Hero Urban Babu, Hero Poor and father-in-law Amir It used to be, the goons were rapists, who could not succeed
 isi tarah jumme kii raat he, baby doll main sone di, fevikol se jaise gaanon kii vyangyatmak saprasang vyakhya kii gai he
 Throughout the book, there are various themes mainly of young people preparing for college life or competitive examinations, their living, their fun and love

 Is the 2019 election like a war between 'justice' and nationalism? The 2019 election is being contested on three or four different fronts
 pehla, ham ghor berogari sankat se jujh rahe hai; deshbhar main yuvaaon ko naukari nahin mil rahi he
 The second is agriculture; Narendra Modi's policies have destroyed agriculture
 teesraa yah he ki arthvyavastha main waisi raftaar nahin dikh rahi, jaisi honi chahie thi; len-dein nahin ho rahaa he jo sthir aarthik vikaas hamane upie ke varshon main dekha tha, vah thapp ho gaya he
 One of the two last front is clear that Modi has done a lot of corruption in the Rafale deal and the other is an attempt to influence the country's institutions- Supreme Court, Election Commission, Planning Commission, etc
, to influence them
 So that they help to shine Modi's politics
 lekin bhaajapa or modi ne chunaav ko suraksha, rashtrawaad or rashtrabhakti par charchaa kii ore mode diya he
 Modi uses national security to divert attention from the larger issues of the country
 yuva berozegaar hai or unhen apana koi bhavishya nahin dikhataa
 This is a big national issue
 pradhanmantri apane bhaashanon main berogari par apane record ke bare main kyon nahin bolte? kya bade paimaane par kisaanon kii khudakshi ek bada rashtriya mudda nahin he? kisaan aatmahatyaayein kar rahe hai
 So why does the Prime Minister not say that i promised you that i will give 2 crore jobs, but i failed
 maine vachan diya tha ki main har bank khate main 15 lakh rupye daaloongaa, main asafal rahaa
 i had promised that agriculture would be given full priority, i also failed in that
 ye asli rashtriya mudde hai
 Why don't they speak on these? Is the security issue that the BJP is raising really a real threat to the country? The biggest danger to the nation is that the programs which were effective in the country in the 1990s are now effective No longer and Modi refused to accept it
 hamane ise sweekaar kiya he
 Our policies worked until around 2012
 upie ke antim do varshon main ham ladkadaane lage
 Modi is doing what we tried to do between 2012 and 2014
 unhone isamen ek sanak bharaa vichaar notebandi jod diya! kisi bhi vyapaaree se puuchhen ki ‘gabbar singh tex’ or notebandi ne uske saath kya kiya
 Ask anyone, big businessman, small businessman
 kisaan se puuchhie, chaahe jisase marji puch lijie
 Where did Modi get the idea that Rs 500
 or 1,000 ru
 Will it be beneficial for the country? So, the economy is facing deep crisis
 lekin pakistan kii aatankwaad ko shah aisa masalaa he ki hamen usase 100 fisadi majbootee se ladane kii jarurat he
 But i also want the Prime Minister to answer how our 45 CRPF jawans died? Is the Prime Minister not responsible for the security of Indian soldiers? Why don't they say that i failed to protect my CRPF jawans? They say they have made two surgical strikes during their tenure? Very well
 manmohan singhji ne teen sargical strike kiye lekin hamane duniya ke saamne dhindhora nahin peeta
 The reason for this is that we did not want to politicize the armed forces, did not want to take advantage of the bravery of our soldiers
 yah unka kaam he, unhen salaam karte hai or unka aadar karte hai
 We do not insult them by politicizing them
 un teen sargical strike kaa parinaam kya rahaa?main is par baat nahin karnaa chahta ki uskaa kya nateeja hua tha
 But the targets that were targeted to be targeted were accurate
 bhaajapa kahati he ki mumbai main aatanki hamale par upie sarkaar javaabi karrwai kii himmat hi nahin juta pai
 The truth is that we had isolated Pakistan diplomatically
 hamane jammu-kashmir mudde par pakistan ko alag-thalag karne ke liye antarrashtriya abhiyaan chalaaya
 We did what we had to do, just we did not do its politics
 vartmaan sarkaar ne kashmir ko lekar sakht ravaiya apana rakhaa he
 Is this effective? Apart from taking political advantage of the troubles of Jammu and Kashmir in other areas of the country, the present government has no policy on Jammu and Kashmir
 aatankwaad ne tab phir se jor pakadaa jab modi ne pidipi ke saath avasarwaadi gathbandhan kiya
 i remember i talked to Arun Jaitley about this when he came to meet me
 maine poocha tha, ‘‘jetali ji, kya aapako ehsaas he ki aap jammu-kashmir main kya kar rahe hai? yah aag lagane vaala he
 Jaitleyji said to me, "no it is not
 kashmir main shanti he, vahaan kuch bhi nahin hone ja rahaa he
 "the truth is that in alliance with the PDP, Modi has given opportunities to spread terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir
 aap kashmir samasya se kis prakaar niptenge?jab upie sarkaar satta main thi, to jammu-kashmir ke liye kaaphi soch-vichaar ke baad ek niti taiyaar kii gai thi
 i also had a role in shaping it and we spent years working on it
 hamane panchayat chunaav karaae; ham tata jaise bade bhartiya udyogpatiyon ko jammu-kashmir lekar gaye, taaki kshetra ke yuvaaon ko nai drushti or naukari mili
 We connected thousands of women to the banking system through self-help groups
 in kadamon ne hamen jammu-kashmir main aatankwaad kii qamar todane main madad kii
 When we came to power in 2004, Kashmir was burning
 jab ham gaye, kashmir kaa maahaul shantipurna tha
 i remember 50 flights a day to Srinagar, which used to take tourists to Kashmir
 isliye kripaya hamaare record or hamaari niti ko dekhen, jo na keval aatankwaad ko kuchalane ke liye balki jammu-kashmir ke logon ke saath judane ke liye he taaki unhen pataa chal sake ki hamaari ek alag drushti he or yah bahut behatar he
 This is the Indian vision
 yah lakhon logon ko garibi se nikaal rahaa he
 Adopt this vision, you have a future in it
 bhaajapa kaa maananaa he ki anuchhed 370 or 35e ko khatm kar dene se kashmir kii samasya kaa samaadhaan ho jayega
 What is your opinion? i don't want to get into these things
 main saamaanya-si baat kah rahaa hum ki ham rashtriya chunaav lard rahe hai, or jahaan tak main dekh saktaa hum, rashtriya chunaav desh kaa bhavishya tay karte hai
 The biggest issues facing the country include the highest rate of unemployment in the last 45 years, the complete destruction of the informal sector, the elimination of small and medium businesses, the destruction of agriculture, the destruction of the economy and all our institutions
 Is the attack
 modi kii videsh niti ko lekar aap kya sochate hai?modi kii koi videsh niti hi nahin he! ve roj sanak ke aadhaar par kaary karte hue dikhaai dete hai
 For example, they go on a tour of Afghanistan and then suddenly decide to go to Pakistan from there
 ve yah bhi nahin samajhate ki afghanistan se pakistan ke liye udaan bharkar, ve afghanistan ke logon ko nakaaratmak sandesh de rahe hai or unke kaaryon ne afgaan sarkaar ko pareshaan kar diya he
 They do not even have basic knowledge of foreign policy
 vastav main unhen lagata he ki videsh niti kaa matlab he duniya ke zyada se zyada netaaon ke gale lag janaa!aap bhi narendra modi ke gale lage the
 They are not foreign leaders
 to, narendra modi ke gale lagane or duusare videshi netaaon ke gale lagane main kya antar he?mere gale lagane main pyaar bharaa tha
 How can you say that when they hug, there is no love in it? i look like this so i can say that
 unka gale milanaa avasarwaadi he
 i saw a PM who was not handling things
 maine ek aise piem ko dekha, jo yah mahasoos kar rahe the ki desh ko chalaanaa kisi rajya ko chalaane jaisaa nahin he or ve funs gaye the
 They were making mistakes one after the other
 or mujh par gussa kar rahe the, mujh par chilla rahe the
 i felt pity for him, felt love for him
 maine kaha, main aapako gale laga rahaa hum
 So i hugged them
 gale lagane main meraa unke liye ek sandesh tha, suniye, main aapkaa virdohi hum, lekin deshhit main, main aapaki madad karne ke liye taiyaar hum
 i moved forward but they eluded me
 us gale milane ke baad unhone aapaki aalochana kii
 And you started saying 'chowkidar Chor Hai'
 aap kehete hai ki aapke man main unke prati dayabhav he
 How can you reconcile these two things? i am kind to them, but i tell the truth
 main sachaai kii andekhi nahin kar saktaa
 The truth is that PM has given Rs 30,000 crore to Anil Ambani
 yah baat aap bhi jaanate hai, mujhe bhi pataa he, puraa desh jaanata he
 And Anil Ambani never made a plane! This is also true
 mujhe sach bataanaa he or sachaai yah he ki ‘chaukeedaar chor he’
 There is no question of withdrawing from it
 is baat ko kehane kaa isse behatar koi tarika nahin he
 If you think it is better to say 'a thief is a watchman' then i can say the same
 aap baar-baar kah rahe hai ki anil ambani ko 30,000 karod rupye mili lekin india today kii report kahati he ki unhen 800 karod rupye kaa theka mila he
 There is a lot of documents showing the exact figures of the Rafale deal
 da hindu akhbaar ne un dastavejon ko chapa he jisamen puraa raksha vibhaag kah rahaa he ki piem samanaantar baatcheet kar rahe hai
 He laid down every rule, every procedure
 raksha mantri ne kaha, “mujhe is nae anubandh ke bare main jaankaree nahin he
 "the old contract is not yet closed, but the Prime Minister is starting a new contract
 is par jaanch hogi or ve isse batch nahin sakate
 So, after the Congress comes to power, will you start an inquiry into the Rafale deal? The world's largest defense contract has been awarded to someone who has never made an aircraft
 isaki jaanch to hogi hi
 What steps will be taken to end corruption? Decentralization is the most effective way to curb corruption
 aaj bahut zyada shakti bahut kam logon ke haathon main kendrit he
 We have to change the decision process and we have to be more transparent in practice
 artiai ko majboot karnaa iske liye mahatvapurn he
 Stringent and prompt action against the corrupt is also important
 kya aap rasukhdaar logon kii jaanch karaayenge?yah rasukhadaaron ke peeche padane kaa sawaal nahin he
 It is not that we will start revenge and will wash our hands behind anyone
 kanoon hai, unka paalan kiya janaa chahie
 But this can only happen if you return to power
 ham nishchit taur par satta main aa rahe hai
 Congress alone or with an alliance? i am not an astrologer, i cannot create a future
 lekin modi chunaav nahin jeet rahe, bhaajapa chunaav nahin jeet rahi he
 The Congress-led UPA is coming to power
 bhaajapa matadaataaon se kah rahi he unhen bahumat den
 She is arguing strong versus forced government
 unka daawa he ki vipaksh kii gathbandhan kii sarkaar kamjor hogi
 Please help me understand this
 kya yah ek majboot sarkaar he jo hamen 45 saal kii sabase oonchi berogari dar ke daur main lekar ai he? kya yah ek majboot sarkaar he, jiske kaarykaal main kisaan aatmahatya karne ko majaboor hai? kya yah ek majboot sarkaar he jise khud par bharosa nahin he or jo sansthaanon ko kuchalane main lagi hui he? majboot sarkaar vah hoti he jo kahati he ki haa ham aapako naukari dene ja rahe hai
 a strong government is one that connects with the people of the country
 majboot sarkaar vah he, jo kahati he, ‘supreme court, ham aapako maanate hai, ham aap par bharosa karte hai, aap jaisaa uchit samajhen karen
 We have so much courage to let you remain independent
 ’ to, kya bhaajapa sarkaar majboot he? nahin, yah ek behad kamjor sarkaar he
 In search of allies, BJP turned out to be faster than Congress
 main aap logon se bahut pyaar karata hum! aapke paas congress ke liye alag niyam hai, bhaajapa ke liye alag
 Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Jammu and Kashmir, we have alliances in several major states
 kuch rajyon main gathbandhan sire nahin chadh paaya or yah bhi thik hi hua
 Why was there no alliance in the most important Uttar Pradesh? We wanted to have an alliance in Uttar Pradesh, but Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party felt that they did not need us
 maine unki ichha kaa sammaan kiya or kaha ki thik he, akele lado lekin ham bhi apni jagah hasil karne ja rahe hai
 i have clearly told Priyanka and Jyotiraditya that our biggest agenda is: Defeat BJP in UP 
 pashchim bengal main mamata banerjee se baat kyon nahin bani?mamata banerjee bhaajapa sarkaar kaa samarthan karne vaali hai yaa dharmanirpeksh sarkaar kaa? kya mayawatiji or mulaayamaji bhaajapa kaa samarthan karenge yaa dharmanirpeksh sarkaar kaa? jis bhi tareeke se aap dekhen, desh main har jagah bhaajapa ko dharmanirpeksh dalon se haar kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 What happened in Delhi? We discussed with the Aam Aadmi Party
 unke saath seat saajhedaari kii ek sahamat bani thi ki chaar par vah ladenge, hamaare liye teen chodenge
 And when i and my party agreed on this, Kejriwal said that he now wants to combine Haryana and Punjab in the talk of alliance
 unka kahana he ki aap peeche hate
 This is completely wrong
 or ve aapako jhootha bataa rahe hai
 When i say something, i stand by my word
 aap meraa purana trek record dekhen or khud is par faisla karen
 If the UPA and its allies together form the government, would you agree to a non-congress prime minister in such a situation? My focus is on defeating the BJP and saving the institutions
 chunaav ke khatm hone tak dekhte hai, kya hota he
 Then we will discuss the results
 sharad pavaar ne kaha he ki jo mukhyamantri rahaa ho, keval vahi pradhanmantri ban saktaa he
 Could this be a mandatory condition? This is his opinion
 sabaki raay hoti he
 As far as i am concerned, i still see only one goal, to protect the institutions of the country by defeating Modi and BJP in the elections
 mujhe or kuch nahin dikh rahaa he
 Like Arjuna, i am only looking at the eye of the fish and i am about to hit that target
 kaha ja rahaa he ki aapke paas do vikalp the bhaajapa ko haraana or apni party ko phir se khadaa karnaa
 You chose the second option and you are aiming for 2024 and not 2019
 
 
 haragij nahin! aisa kuch bhi nahin he
 We are going to win this election
 ham chunaav joardaar tareeke se jeetne ja rahe hai
 You do not report it, you are not excited by it, there is pressure on you
 andar hi andar is sarkaar ke khilaaf ek badi lahar chal rahi he
 Narendra Modi and BJP are going to collapse
 aapane jis nyaay yojana kaa haal hi main zikr kiya tha, uske liye fund kahaan se aayega?nyaay yojana main do chijen hai
 It will help the poor people out of the shackles of poverty, but, equally important, it will revive the Indian economy
 notebandi or kharaab jiesti ke kaaran arthvyavastha kii jo saans ruk gai hai, use phir se dhadkane main madad milegi
 Our system has excellent economists and has worked on it for several months
 yah paisa madhyam varg se nahin liya jane vaala he
 This i guarantee
 iske liye ek rupaya bhi aap par kar lagaakar nahin jutaya jayega
 We have calculated that the money can be arranged only from the current sources of revenue
 sarkari yojanaon main apvyay ko kam karke or sarkari parisampattiyon ke behatar mudrikaran se
 Some of this money is going to come from crony capitalists like Anil Ambani
 yah kaise hoga? yah bhi modi kii usee baat kii tarah to nahin he ki videshon main chupa kaala dhan jabt kar bharat laaenge or har khate main 15 lakh ru
 Will be inserted? Not at all! i keep my promises unlike Modi
 hamane nyaay kaa ek vittiya model banaaya he or iskaa puraa pareekshan kiya he
 My team believes that it can be implemented without harming the economy
 rojgaar sabase mahatvapurn he
 It seems that the initial plan of Congress is to provide a lot of government jobs
 ek to hamen apni arthvyavastha ke ingine ko phir se chaalu karnaa hoga taaki maang bade or isse badi sankhya main rojgaar ke nae avasar banane main madad milegi
 In this way, we will first reach the level where our economy stood before demonetisation and imposition of Gabbar Singh tax at the hands of Modi
 nyaay hamaare aarthik ingine ko phir se shuru karne main mahatvapurn he kyonki yah garibon ke haathon main nakadi daalkar arthvyavastha ko phir se sangathit karegi
 They will spend it, which will create demand and help our economy to gain momentum
 ab is bare main baat karte hai ki ham us sthiti tak pahunchane ke baad kaise aage badhenge
 India is the skill capital of the world
 har ek jile main kaushal he, lekin ham unka sammaan nahin karte
 We do not think of connecting those skills to the economy
 mul siddhant vishisht kaushal vaale kshetron kii pahchaan karnaa or unhen bhartiya or vaishvik arthvyavastha se jodna he
 People tell IT a big success story
 vastav main kya hua tha ki bhartiya software ejiniyaron kaa kaushal bangaluru or yahaan tak ki silicon vaili jaise shaharon se judaa tha or unhen apane kaushal ke madhyam se khud ko sabit karne ke liye ek avasar diya gaya tha
 There are thousands and thousands of centers of skill like Mirzapur or Sriperumbudur, which have the potential to grow and create millions of jobs
 ek or baat, ham keval jidipi vruddhi par dhyaan kendrit karne kaa jokhim nahin uthaa sakate hai
 GDP growth should be seen in terms of employment generation
 philhal desh main nae rojgaar paidaa kiye bina jidipi vruddhi vaale vikaas kii jarurat nahin
 Where will the private sector stand in this? What will be their role in this scheme? The private sector is a key player in the creation of new jobs
 desh main nijee or saarvajanik donon kshetron ke bharpoor vikaas kii jagah he
 We are going to invest heavily in education and healthcare
 isse lakhon nai sarkari naukariyaan paidaa hongi
 Urbanized India needs a public health system and a more robust public education system
 main yah nahin kah rahaa hum ki hamen nijee udhyamon ko band kar dena chahie lekin vishwastareey saarvajanik, iity jaise sansthaanon ke liye jagah he, taaki nijee khilaadi kah saken, ‘oh, e grad santhaan hone ke liye aisa bananaa padataa he’ or ve us str ke santhaan banane kii aakankshaayen paalen
 To help build private enterprises, we have put a unique idea in our manifesto
 aaj yuva start-ap udhyamiyon ke liye sabase badi samasya yah he ki jab bhi ve kisi vyavsaay ko kholane kii koshish karte hai, to sabase pehle unhen anumati ke liye 15-16 sarkari vibhaagon main janaa padataa he, jiskaa matlab he ki aamtaur par unhen rishwat deni hi padati he
 Therefore, we have decided that a three-year exemption will be granted with government permission to start a new business
 teen saal baad, jab aapke paas 20-30 log kaam kar rahe honge, tab aap aaen or kahen ki ab, mujhe anumati chahie
 We will allow you
 ham apane kisaanon, naujavaanon, udhyamiyon kii baadhaaen kam karke unhen apni puri kshamta se vikaas kaa mauka dena chaahate hai
 We believe that this will create millions of new jobs
 aap saarvajanik kshetron ke vinievesh ke paksh main he yaa khilaaf? kya air india ko band kar dena chahie?aap mujhe kshamaa karenge lekin yah poochna bada bachakaana lagata he ki ham iske khilaaf hai yaa paksh main hai? hamaare paas saarvajanik vinievesh kii niti he
 It is necessary to privatize certain things
 kuch anya chizon ke liye bilkul nahin
 Therefore, there should be no question as to whether you are in favor or against it ”
 yah ek rashtriya str ke netaa se puche jane laayak prashn nahin he, aise prashn hyskool ke bacchon se puche jate hai
 Come to me with good questions and i will answer them better
 krishi sankat dur karne ke liye aapane rin maafee kii baat kii he
 But Modi accuses you that you did not implement it in the three states where you won the elections recently
 krishi ko lekar aapkaa kya najariya he?sabase pehle to main bataa duun ki hamane apana vaada nibhaayaa he or hamaari sarkaron ne shapath grahan ke 48 ghante ke bheetar krishi rin maafee kii aadhikarik ghoshnaa kii he
 Obviously, implementation takes time
 duusare, ham samajhate hai ki krishi rin maafee krishi sankat kaa samaadhaan nahin he
 It is a confidence boosting measure and our aim is to provide relief to the farmers from their immediate pain
 tisare, kisaanon ko upaj kaa uchit mulya nahin miltaa he kyonki koi cold chen, koi bhandaaran suvidha, kheton or khaane kii mej ke bich koi sidhaa judaav nahin he
 So, we add farms using food processing units, infrastructure, technology
 unhen bhartiya or vaishvik arthvyavastha se jodne ke kadam uthaaen
 Also, we have to be sensitive so that farmers do not lose confidence in the basic way
 rajkaaj kaa aapkaa apana darshan kya he?main nishpakshta pasand karata hum
 Tomorrow i will feel that if the biggest industrialists of the country are being treated unfairly, then i will work for them
 agar mujhe lagata he ki kisaanon ke saath galat vyavhaar kiya ja rahaa he, to main unke liye kaam karuunga
 i do not differentiate between the people of the country
 meraa model he ki jahaan mujhe dard dikhaai detaa he, main vahaan jaataa hum
 Tomorrow, if governments start doing injustice to the biggest corporate houses, then i will protect the corporate houses
 main desh ko is / us rup main nahin dekhtaa
 i see the country as a beautiful treaty
 apane samuhik gyaan or hamaari samvaad prakriya ke saath, ham bahut shaktishaalee chijen kar sakate hai, jo anya desh nahin kar sakate kyonki ham moulik rup se ahimsa or karunaa main vishwaas karte hai
 One thing you would like to learn from Narendra Modi? How to give various messages to many people simultaneously
 ek hi samay par aap kisi or se kuch kahen or usee samay kisi or se iske ekadam vipareet kaise kahen! haalanki, isamen ek nishchit maatra main chal he, jo mujhe asahaj karata he or main usamen sakasham nahin hum
 But this is the skill they have to bet
 yah unki badi takat he
 For me the 2014 debacle was the best thing because it taught me that i have to be generous towards people, even when people are abusing you and yelling and beating at you
 use palatakar mat maaro, use gale lagaao
 Someone is abusing you, no problem
 phir bhi uskaa sammaan karo
 One day i saw an interview of Narendra Modi, "only Narendra Modi can challenge Narendra Modi!" It made my brain numb
 mujhe aisa lag rahaa tha, “he bhagwaan, ek vyakti kii vishwa ke prati aisi soch kaise ho sakati he?” jab baat kisaani kii aegi to ek kisaan mujhe chunauti de saktaa he, aap bhi mujhe kuch chizon main chunauti de sakate hai
 There are some things i know, but i don't know everything
 main sarvajna hum, yahi sanakeepan kii paribhaasha he! main insaan hum
 What leadership tips did you learn from parents? Then, one-sided, simple question
 netritv parivartansheel hota he
 Five years ago it worked, it no longer works
 netritv “sunanaa” he
 You do not like the talk, yet you listen
 jo aapako pareshaan kar rahaa he, to use or zyada suno
 If someone insults you, then try to understand why he is doing this
 yah ek gatisheel prakriya he, yah seekhney kii prakriya he
 So, what values have you learned from parents? To love everyone
 or kuch myne nahin rakhata
 Love all apane virdohi, priyajan, dushman, aapse ghrinaa karne vaale log, jaanavar
 Love this world because it is a beautiful bed! You are very conscious about fitness
 jo log feet rahanaa chaahate hai unke liye aapkaa kya suzav he?jid
 Sometimes i teach my friends how to run and they say i can't run 5 kilometers
 main kahata hum, pagal mat bano, tum philhal 5 kimi nahin daud sakate, lekin tum 5 kimi daud sakate ho, agar tum lagaataar daudane kaa abhyaas jari rakho, to ham tumhen 5 kimi se 10 kimi, phir 20 kimi or 200 kimi tak daudaayenge! lekin is vichaar ke saath shuruyaat na karen ki mujhase nahin ho paaegaa
 You can do this
 yah sab jid he
 This also applies in everyday life
 sabhi ne mujhe bataaya ki narendra modi ko haraaya nahin ja saktaa
 i said, "yes, you believe so?" i asked, tell me what is the strength of Narendra Modi? He said, he has a strong (corruption-free) image
 maine kaha, “thik he, main unki is takat ko taar-taar karne ja rahaa hum
 "and i have done it
 jid, mere dost! chalate rahen or chalate rahen
 And i will keep going, until Rafael's truth is revealed! Who do you trust first in mother and sister? i consult mother and sister about different things

 Both are same, both are same for me
 ve alag nahin hai
 But why did you stop Priyanka from entering politics first? And why bring him down now? When Priyanka's children were young, she stayed away from politics and focused on her upbringing
 ab jab unke bachche bade ho gaye hai or uniwarsity ja rahe hai to unhen laga ki ve raajnneeti main bhoomika nibhaa sakati hai
 When you took over as Congress president, the stage was filled with old Congressmen and you said that you would vacate the stage and prepare the way for the youth to reach the top
 phir bhi, jis din priyanka shaamil huin, vah mahasachiv ban gayi or unhen seedblusi main shaamil kiya gaya
 So for some people who want to join the Congress, there is a separate system where they go directly to the CWC and different to others where they have to shout slogans for years to progress

 But it is a fight, a war

 And my sister is a capital in that fight
 main apni bahan ko apni bahan ke rup main nahin dekhtaa, main use ek aisi puunji ke rup main dekhtaa hum jo us khaali jagah ko bharne main sakasham hogi
 There are many other talents like him in the Congress
 aapane rajasthan or madhya pradesh main sachin payalat or jyotiraditya sindhiya jaise yuva netaaon ko satta kyon nahin saunpi?badi sankhya main aise varisht netaa hai jinhone bahut samay diya he, party ke liye balidaan diya he or unke paas bahut gyaan or anubhav he
 There are also some very talented young leaders with tremendous energy and potential
 maine pehle anubhav ko tarjeeh di or kuch samay baad, yuva urja ko mauka diya jayega
 If Wayanad and Amethi win both seats, which of the two seats will they hold? i have not given any thought to this

 amethi meraa parivaar he
 However, when i went to Tamil Nadu for the first time in my life, i realized that the people there were asking if we had equal rights in the country? This feeling is all over South India

 i have to tell the South that no, you are as important as the North
 yahi vajah he ki maine kerala se ladane kaa vikalp chunaa
 Narendra Modi told Akshay Kumar that he likes mangoes, so we want to know which taste or fruit does Rahul Gandhi like? i vipassana
 man fal ke swaad kaa nirnay karata he
 You can like or dislike any fruit you want
 aap aam ko pasand karnaa chun sakate hai, aap ise nafrat karnaa chun sakate hai
 You can choose to like poor people, you can choose to hate them
 aap apane dimag main har cheez kaa nirmaan karte hai
 The mind decides everything
 main kisi se ghrinaa karnaa shuru kar saktaa hum, lekin thodi baatcheet ke baad, main uski najaron se chizon ko dekhnaa shuru karuunga, or phir mujhe lagegaa ki vastav main to yah vyakti mujhe pasand he; vah to bahut acha insaan he
 'but to answer your question, i would say: i like mangoes, i like bananas, i never liked carrots, but now i like them
 mujhe kabhi asparagus pasand nahin tha, lekin main ab karata hum
 Would you like to become Prime Minister? Who am i to decide? That is, suppose you are fully ready to become Prime Minister? i will again say who am i to decide this? About 90 crore people are voting, they have to decide
 ve jo bhi chunate hai, main usase khush hum
 To be fair, the decision that the country will give on 23 May will be the right decision, whatever the decision may come
 yahi sahi faisla he or main iskaa sammaan karuunga
 This is what it means to be Indian
 isliye nahin, jaisaa ki modi kehete hai, aap namdaar hai, vanshavaadi hai?yah ekapaksheeya he
 My family members are in politics, but their experience is not my experience
 meraa anubhav jabardast sangharsh or hinsa kaa rahaa he
 i have witnessed the death of my father and grandmother, i have won and lost elections
 aap mere puure anubhav ko ek shabd main kaise samet sakate hai? main jo hum mujhe usase samajhen, usase parakhen
 Listen to me carefully and evaluate me based on who i am
 pakistan se aatankwaad ko mil rahe shah se ham 100 fisadi muqabla karenge
 
 
 But i want the Prime Minister to answer how 45 CRPF personnel should get an answer to how the world's largest defense contract was given to someone who never even built an aircraft
 Is this a strong government that gives us 45 Has brought in the highest unemployment rate of the year? Farmers are committing suicide and institutions are being crushed, justice will bring life to the economy

 The money will be raised from the existing revenue resources and government assets
 We want to crush terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir but also want to connect with people in a different way, so that they can adopt our attitude of getting out of poverty ***

 kya aapako yaad he, aapane apane aas-paas kisi kavi sammelan yaa mushaayare main kavi yaa shaayar ko di jane vaali daad ‘vaah-vaah’ kab suni thi
 May not remember
 kisi samay main logon ke manoranjan kaa ekmaatr saadhan mushaayare or kavi sammelan ab shaharon main khojane se bhi nahin milte
 Funkars who demonstrate their talent to the people in these events believe that these traditional ceremonies are ending their existence due to changing the interest of people and new means of entertainment
 prakhyat shaayar manjar bhopali ne is baat par du:kha vyakt kiya ki bharat main janm hone ke baad bhi ab mushaairon ko apane hi desh main kadradaan nahin milte
 Manjar said, 'few people know that Urdu mushayars were born in India, just like the poets' conferences
 mushaairon kii shuruuaat bahadur shah jafar ke samay main hui thi, lekin ab bharat main hi mushaairon kaa rup puri tarah vikrut ho gaya he
 Manjar, who has demonstrated his fun in Mushayars in different countries of the world, including the US, Britain and Australia, said, "people abroad have a great enthusiasm for Mushayars and they have been waiting for them for months, but now in their own country Responsible institutions are completely blind to this
 videshon main mushaayare paramparaayen bachaane or agali peedi tak apni samskruti pahunchane ke liye yojit karaae jate hai, lekin bharat main inhen ‘timopas’ ke nazariye se dekha jaataa he
 'bollywood hero Amitabh Bachchan also continues to worry about the number of poets' conferences and mushairs falling in the country from time to time
 amitabh ne kuch din pehle apane blog par bhi likhaa tha ki unke pita harivansh raay bachchan ke samay kii tarah ab shaharon main kavi sammelan or mushaayare nahin hote, jo sahitya premiyon ke liye chintaa kaa sabab he
 Veteran litterateur and poet Manik Verma, who has demonstrated his talent in many countries, also agreed that the importance of poet conferences has been reduced in the country
 verma ne kaha ‘kuch shaharon ko chhod kar ab desh se kavi sammelnon kaa astitv mitata ja rahaa he
 Even where poets' conferences are held, people neither listen to them with juice nor encourage poets
 ’ verma ne kaha ‘kavi sammelan main tikat nahin lagata, isliye log sochate hai ki chalo jab kuch nahin karnaa, to kavi sammelan main chale jaaen
 The real appreciation of poet conventions and mushairs is probably over now
 pehle puri-puri raat aise aayojan hote the, lekin ab log aise aayojanon ke bajaae cinemagharon main jane ko praathamikta dete hai
 Shayra Nuzhat Parvez, who took part in Mushayars in many places in central India, attributed the decrease in popularity of Mushayars to the change in interest of the people
 nujahat ne kaha ‘‘fatafat peedi ko itani fursat hi kahaan he ki vah mushaairon yaa kavi sammelnon main jaakar ghanton baith kar kisi ek vyakti ko sune
 This makes them sit in AC for three hours and watch the romance
 ’ nujahat ne kaha ‘mushaayare or kavi sammelan ek baar phir apni puraani rangath paa sakate hai, lekin iske liye samskruti se jude logon or sarkaar ko mil kar prayaas karne chahie
 Such events also need proper publicity, in whose absence the existence of these ceremonies is being erased

 Addressing the rally in Lakhimpur Kheri, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that till now most of the Congress, SP and BSP governments have been formed in the state, but have they changed the lives of the people so far
 modi ne kaha ki 2014 main logon ne sabhi partiyon ko saaf kar diya tha, baaki sirf do kunbon ke log 2014 main jite the
 Modi attacked Akhilesh and said that the alarm bell rang in 2014 itself
 2014 main congress ko sajaa di or basapa ko saaf kar diya
 At the same time, all the dreams of SP have been shattered, yet it is not ready to improve
 Modi said in Lakhimpur - Modi said that the family was not broken in 2014 - Struck people on sp-congress in first phase - Third manifesto in haste Lae - Even on bringing 10 issues, there is no possibility of survival in UP - i am ready to go to Lucknow from here, - PM Modi said that if the work of fooling people continues in this way, then how Program Clega- you Medanta hospital opening in a hurry because you were worried about speaking work, - he said that Akhilesh g Your task is to tell it and speaking exploits match your party
 - har din 15-15 hatyaein ho rahi he, puraa uttar pradesh jaanata he ki jo jail main band he wo andar se hi apane gang chalaa rahe hai
 - Modi said that Uttar Pradesh has destroyed the politics of sp-congress, - Modi said that your brother is sitting in Delhi, who wants to serve you, just give it a chance
 - modi bole ki akhilesh sarkaar ne kisaanon kaa haq chhina, bijepi kii sarkaar banane ke baad 14 din main ganna kisaanon kaa bakaayaa chuktaa kar diya jayega
 After the formation of BJP government, the debt of small farmers will be forgiven
 - uttar pradesh kii vajah se 30 saal baad purna bahumat kii sarkaar bani, bijepi kii sarkaar banane kii pehali hi meeting main kisaanon kaa karj maaf kar diya jayega
 - PM Modi said that SP aligned Dr
 Congress lohia ko badnaam kiya he

 - akhilesh ke rahete sirf 14 pratishat kisaanon kaa beemaa hua he, lekin madhyapradesh or chhattisgarh main zyada beemaa hua
 Only gave the benefit of farmer insurance to his people
 - piem modi bole ki mayawati ke ghotaale dabaane ke badale main akhilesh ji apane kya liya he yah uttar pradesh kii janata jaananaa chaahati he
 - Akhilesh's habit of exploits, not habit of work - 60-70 percent of what the farmer produces in Haryana buys the crop, which does not cause losses to the farmers, where the BJP government is where it is
 lekin akhilesh sarkaar 3 pratishat kisaanon kii hi fasal kharidti he
 The farmer will get a fair price when the BJP government is formed
 - bijepi ke mantra vikaas he, vikaas ke liye sarkaar banani chahie, sarkaar bhai-bhatijawad ke liye nahin honi chahie
 The government is for the farmers, the government is for the poor - both the families have the same qualities, both have the same qualities
 - desh or pradesh ko luutane vaale mil jaaen to yahaan kaa bhavishya kya hoga,- pradesh ke afasar kehete hai ki dm banane ke liye 70 lakh rupee lagate hai, isliye afasar janata ko luutata he
 It was suspended at the behest of the officer - between Madam Mayawati's government, between 2010 and 2012, electricity was operated in 23 villages of Uttar Pradesh

 - Our government said that it had asked to provide electricity to 18000 villages in 1000 days
 - hamaari sarkaar ne do saal main uttar pradesh ke 1500 gaanvon main se 1364 gaanvon main bijli pahunchaai
 - In 2014, Congress was contesting on the issue of 9 cylinders or 12 cylinders - earlier Sasando used to get 25 coupons of gas cylinders for a year, some mps also blacken the coupons
 piem modi ne kaha ki bhrashtachar kii ladaai main chaiyn se nahin baithunga, ye ladaai jari rahegibadanu main bolaa tha akhilesh par hamalisse pehle 11 farvari ko badanu main raily ko sambodhit karte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ne samaajawaadee party or congress ke gathbandhan ko nishane par liya tha
 The PM had said that in 2014 my MP from Badaun did not win, but the people of Badaun belonged to me
 mayawati, mulaayam ko jahaan pahunchnaa tha pahunch gaye, lekin aazaadee ke baad bhi yahaan bijli nahin pahunch pai
 Akhilesh speaks that work speaks, while child knows that Akhilesh does not speak about his work
 yahaan akhilesh ke chahete vidhayak hai, unhone apni party par hi aarope lagaaya ki avaidh khanan, bijli main bhrashtachar karte hai

 After Pink once again, Amitabh Bachchan and Taapsee Pannu pair has come through Badla
 badla ek suspence thriller drama he
 Movies have been produced in this genre from time to time
 bing sirus, gumnaam, gupt, baazeegar, wo koun thi, drishyam, kahani or andhaadhun jaisi filmon kii list kaaphi lambii he
 The story of Revenge is quite strong and it also has tremendous suspense
 aaie jaanate hai ki kahani or andhaadhun jaisi filmon ke mukaable kisi ban padi he badla
 What is the story of the film: The story of the film is of Naina (taapsee Pannu)
 naina ek yang antraprenyor he
 Married and is the mother of a child
 haalanki wo arjuna naam ke ek shaadishuda shaks ke saath extramarital afaire main bhi he
 The two hide in Paris and meet each other's family in Paris
 isi bich kahin jane ke dauraan road accident main naina kii car se, sani naam ke ek ladke kii maut ho jaati he
 After which both erase the evidence of Sunny's death
 lekin sani kii maut ko lekar koi donon ko blackmel karata he
 Demands money
 donon blackmailer ko rakam dene ek hotel main pahunchate hai, yaheen se shuru hota he kahani main twist
 Actually, Arjun dies in the hotel and the blame is on Naina
 amrutha singh ne sani kii maa kaa role nibhaayaa he
 Amitabh Bachchan is in the role of prosecutor, he is seen trying to tackle Naina's case
 ab film kii kahani kaa tanabana kuch sawaalon main bunane kii koshish hui he
 Like how Arjun died suddenly? The one who asks for money comes to the hotel room, but why does he leave without taking the money? What is Amitabh's character? Who is the blackmailer? Who murdered Arjun? To know all such questions, one has to watch the film
 vaise isamen suspence arjuna kii hatya se alag wo cheez he jo film ke tital se judi hui he
 The film has tremendous suspense till Interval
 kyon dekhen-film kii kahani majboot he
 Suspense is maintained from beginning to end
 kirdaaron ko kis samay par kaise film main pesh karnaa he is baat par vishesh dhyaan diya gaya he
 Filming the story the way it is is a challenging task
 lekin iske liye nirdesan or sampaadan kii taareef kii jaani chahie
 Since the film has been woven through many questions, due to this, the next question remains interested in the film when one question is answered
 seens achche ban pade hai
 The best thing about revenge is that it does not bore and maintains interest till the end
 haalanki is film kii sabase badi kamajori yah he ki kalakaaron kaa abhinay bahut umdaa najar nahin aata
 This may be due to the lack of dramaticness in the story
 badla ko amitabh bachchan yaa taapasi pannu kii bahut behtareen acting ke liye yaad nahin kiya jayega
 The works of Amrita Singh or other artists can be said to be right in their place
 film ke kuch outdoor lokation prabhavi hai
 Lights contribute a lot to suspense thriller drama
 badla main camera or roshni kaa acha istemaal kiya gaya he
 Why not watch - If you are not used to watching more curved movies then this film is not for you
 film ke dialogs par zyada kaam nahin kiya gaya he
 The story of the film is as brilliant as it is, it has been filmed in the best way, but any film can reach the audience's heart only because of good dialogues
 film main gane nahin hai
 Background score can also be said to be correct according to mood
 purv kii upie sarkaar main aadhaar ke master mind or infosis ke ko-founder nandan nilekani ko kendriya rigerv bank ke digital pement samiti kaa pramukh niyukt kiya gaya he
 RBI has constituted Digital Payment Committee Committee to promote digital payments
 is cameti main nilekani samet paanch sadsy honge
 Besides Nilekani, the committee includes former RBI deputy governor HR Khan, former MD and CEO of Vijaya Bank Kishore Sanasi, former secretary Aruna Sharma in the Ministry of IT and Steel and Sanjay Jain, Chief Innovation Officer, IIM Ahmedabad
 kya hoga kambometi kaa kaam desh main digital pement kii maujuuda sthiti or isaki khaamiyon ke bare main jaankaree ikattha karnaa or in samasyaon ko dur karne ke upaay sujhana he
 Apart from this, the committee will also conduct cross country analysis to accelerate the economy and financial inclusion through greater use of digital payments
 yah cameti pehali baithak ke 90 dinon ke baad apni report pesh karegi
 Who is Nandan Nilekani? In 2017, Infosys, the second largest software exporter in the country, appointed Nandan Nilekani as the chairman of the company
 aadhaar pariyojna ko lekar charchaa main rahe nilekani march 2002 se april 2007 tak company ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari the
 He was then made the head of UIDAI, the Unique Identification Authority of India of the central government
 nilekani 2014 main congress ke tikat par bengalooru kii south seat se loksabhaa chunaav lard chuke hai
 However, he had to face defeat from Anant Kumar of BJP
 ve 2015 se raajnneeti main sakriy nahin hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party has targeted the bjp's tweet in which Delhi BJP president and BJP national spokesperson are using mineral water to clean the toilet during the cleanliness drive in Yamuna Vihar
 aam aadmi party ke pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj ne manoj tiwari ke twit par tanj karte hue likhaa he ki mineral water setoiletsaaf karne vaali tasviir dekhakar unhen purv dilli bijepi adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay kii yaad aati he
 From Satish Upadhyay (2014) to Manoj Tiwari (2017), little changed in BJP and so is their MCD

 com / sp4fas8emn— Saurabh Bharadwaj (@saurabh_mlagk)2 October 2017saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha, ye tasviir is baat kii yaad dilaati he ki kis tarah lodhi road kii saaf sadak par mahaz tasviir khinchane ke liye kooda failaa diya tha
 Saurabh Bhardwaj shared that 2014 photo of Satish Upadhyay on Twitter
 aapako bataa den ki safai abhiyaan ke tahat utar purvi dilli ke yamuna vihaar main bijepi netaa sambit paatra or saansad manoj tiwari sadak par jhaadu lagane or shauchalay saaf karne pahunche the
 Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal, while targeting the bjp's plan to ask him five questions, said why the party is secretly attacking him and not accepting the challenge of public debate
 kejariwal ne kaha, main lambey samay se unase saarvajanik bahes ke liye kah rahaa hum
 Why are they hiding under the cover and asking questions? Come and debate and answer the public's questions
 ve taiyaar kyon nahin hai
 The five questions that BJP has prepared for Kejriwal include why he formed the government with the support of the Congress last year, while he promised not to do so
 ek anya prashn he ki unhone purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ke khilaaf maamla darj karne kaa vaada kyon nahin puraa kiya
 Kejriwal once again claimed that many senior BJP leaders have united to defeat Kiran Bedi in the upcoming election
 unhone kaha, kiranji ke aane se pehle ve aapas main lard rahe the, ab ve unhen haraane ke liye ek ho gaye hai
 Kejriwal, who had been an ally of Anna Hazare, expressed support for Anna's plan to quit the agitation against the Center despite differences
 unhone kaha, main unke sabhi andolanon main unka samarthan karanga, jab tak ki vah meri madad se inkaar nahin karte
 He considers politics as dirty, whereas i consider it necessary to join it to clean it
 vichaaron main yah antar he
 The exit poll predicts the return of the Fadnavis government from a major loss to the Congress; in the poll, the party has not voted for the Maharashtra Assembly elections, which has not been made in the party with very backward Congress leaders
 ummidavaaron kii kismat kaa faisla 24 oktober ko nateezon ke din saamne aayega
 But it is clear from the estimates of India today-axis My India exit poll that came before the results that the Congress may have to face a severe defeat in the state
 yahaan congress-ensipi saath milakar chunaav lard rahe hai
 The alliance seems to get only 72-90 seats out of the total 288
 sattadhari bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan phir se vaapasi karne ja rahaa he jise 166-194 siten milane kaa anumaan he
 The Congress party suffered a crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 maharashtra ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhi party kaa haal kuch vaisaa hi rah saktaa he
 Assembly elections were held in Haryana along with Maharashtra
 donon hi rajyon main bijepi ke aage vipaksh besahaara najar aayaa
 One, the bumper victory of the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections has upset the opposition parties, on the other hand, the remaining opposition has also succumbed to the policies of the government
 maujuuda samay main mukhya vipakshi dal congress, netaa or niti viheen party si dikh rahi he
 The Congress Congress, which is very backward in campaigning, is still looking for its president and the party has currently appointed Sonia Gandhi as the interim president
 vahiin loksabhaa chunaav kii haar ke baad adhyaksh pad chhod chuke rahul gandhi vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan prachaar karne main kaaphi pichad gaye
 In both states, Rahul Gandhi held only 7 rallies while Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the supreme leader of the ruling party at the center, addressed 25 rallies in Haryana and Maharashtra
 rahul gandhi voting se saptaahabhar pehle chunaav prachaar main utre, jahaan unhen sthaneey netaaon kaa saath tak nahin mila
 On the one hand, heavyweights like BJP from PM Modi to Amit Shah, Nitin Gadkari, Rajnath Singh and Yogi Adityanath had gone into the election campaign, on the other hand, there was no big face in the Congress other than Rahul Gandhi asking for votes for the party
 aakhri vakt main purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne rasm adaayagi karte hue ek press conference jarur kii
 Sonia Gandhi abstained from campaigning and Rahul Gandhi had to rally in her place
 congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ne bhi donon rajyon main ek bhi raily ko sambodhit nahin kiya
 She only targeted the bjp's policies through social media and especially targeted the Yogi government of UP
 maharashtra main chunaav se ain vakt pehle congress ke pradesh adhyaksh bhi badal die gaye
 Milind Deora also replaced Sanjay Nirupam, and Balasaheb Thorat was elected the new president
 sanjay nirupam or milind devda party haikaman par hi sawaal uthaate rahe or chunaav prachaar main bhi nahin utre
 Even these leaders did not share the dais with their leader Rahul Gandhi
 vahiin, maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne kul 65 chunavi reliyaan kii or wo piem modi ke saath bhi 9 reliyon main pahunche
 But no major Maharashtra leader shared the stage with Rahul Gandhi on behalf of the Congress
 muddon par nahin bani ekaricongress apane chunaav prachaar main rashtriya muddon par bijepi ko gherti najar ai
 The Congress was targeting its opponents on the same national issues on which Prime Minister Modi and BJP were seeking votes from the public
 dhara 370 se lekar teen talaak, enarasi jaise muddon ko bijepi apni uplabdhi bataati rahi jabaki congress lagaataar inke virodh par adi rahi
 There were many issues on which the voices of Congress leaders were seen differently
 kashmir se 370 hataane kaa milind devda jaise netaa samarthan kar chuke hai jise lekar congress lagaataar bijepi or piem modi par nishaanaa saadh rahi he
 Congress continued to raise issues like demonetisation, GST and Nirav Modi as before in the Maharashtra elections, which have proved ineffective in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 in muddon ko puure loksabhaa chunaav main uthaane ke baavjood congress sirf 52 siton par simat gai or bijepi 303 siten jeetne main safal rahi thi
 The BJP also raised the issue of awarding Bharat Ratna to Savarkar in the Maharashtra elections in the middle election, on which the Congress seemed to be stuck because the party was not clear about it and various statements came from the leaders
 maharashtra main bagaiyr chehre ke lard rahi congress kaa muqabla devendra fadanvis ke charchit chehre se rahaa
 Bijpi also has a trump card in the name of Narendra Modi
 agsit pole ke anumaanon main bhi isaki jhalak dekhne ko mili
 In such a situation, if these estimates match the results, then the road ahead in Maharashtra may become even more difficult for the Congress
 ramajas college main hui hinsak jhadap kaa bhugtan dilli uniwarsity ke SGTB khalsa college ko bhi uthaanaa padaa
 Nukkad Natak was to be organized in the Khalsa College this year like every year when there was a dispute
 is naatak main 9 group hissaa lene vaale the, magar is aayojan ko roak diya gaya
 Saikat Ghosh, assistant professor and theater coordinator of Khalsa College, alleged that the program was canceled after repeated threats from DUSU
 sangh kii deshbhakti par tha nukkad naatakaghosh kaa kahana he inamen rashtriya swayan sevak sangh ke rashtravaadi prem par ek naatak hona tha, magar ise roak diya gaya
 Ghosh says, 'don't we have the right to show it through our drama
 hamaara ye bhi kahana tha ki pehle aap naatak dekh len, uske baad faisla karen, magar koi sunne ko raji nahin tha
 Police did not help, Ghosh said that there were constant threats from DUSU and the police also appealed to postpone the event to restore peace and normalcy in the campus
 ghosh nepulice kibhumika ko lekar bhi sawaal khadey kiye
 According to Ghosh, if the police had provided security, a street theater would have been organized
 sirf gundgardee karti he abvpgora kaa kahana he ki do varsh pehle bhi aisi hi ghatana hui thi
 When ABVP threatened him during a play and was forced to stop the play
 ghosh kaa kahana he ki desh ke vitt mantri arun jetali bhi abivipi ke chaatr rahe hai, magar unhone apatkaal ke khilaaf college se ladaai ladi
 Now ABVP has changed, only hooliganism
 desh kii sabase badi jaanch agency sibiai kaam ke baari boj or main power kii kami se jujh rahi he
 a total of 1584 posts are lying vacant in the bureau
 desh main bhrashtachar kii badhati shikayaton ke bichasibiaike paas in keson par ambara laga hua he
 Only two former CBI directors are involved in corruption cases
 haalanki in maamalon kii jaanch ke liye sibiai ke paas paryaapt adhikari hi nahin or is kaaran maamalon kii jaanch lambey vakt tak ataki rah jaati he
 The 2016-17 report of the central government ministry, dopt, shows that out of a total of 7274 sanctioned posts of CBI, 1584 posts are lying vacant
 yani vibhaag main 20% se zyada pad khaali hai or desh bhare ke bade-bade maamalon kii jaanch kaa jimmaa mahaj 5,690 adhikariyon ke kandhe par tiki he
 According to the dopt report, both positions for the Special Director in the CBI are still vacant
 iske alaava joint diarector kaa bhi pad khaali padaa he, to diaiji level ke bhi 25 padon par koi bahaali nahin
 2 posts of Special Director vacant in CBI, 1 post of Joint Director, 25 posts of DIG, SSP Sports, 8 posts of Police Superintendent, 37 posts of Inspector, 256 posts of Sub Inspector, 230 posts of Deputy Inspector, 369 posts are vacant
 sibiai bhrashtachar ke jo bhi maamle dekh rahi he, usamen prashasnic adhikariyon ke khilaaf chal rahe maamle to hai hi, iske alaava kai kaarobaari bhi sibiai ke shikanje main hai
 In such a situation, if the government does not reinstate the officers, then the functioning of this largest investigation agency of the country is bound to be affected

 co / 03bisajfqc influenza e virus ke ek prakaar H1N1 ke maanav sanskaran dwaara swine flu paidaa hota he
 The H1N1 virus spreads like a common flu virus
 jab koi sankramit vyakti khaansata yaa cheenkta he to uski saanson se nikali choti-choti boonden hawa main fail kar aasapaas ke kathor sataha par tik jaati hai
 If a healthy person breathes this infected air or touches the infected surface, the virus goes inside it, and when these viruses come in contact with the person there is a higher risk of getting infected with swine flu
 swine flu kaa virus ek insaan se duusare insaan tak bahut teji se failata he
 When a person suffering from H1N1 virus coughs or sneezes, these viruses float in the droplets released from his breath and move to the surrounding hard surface and survive on him for the next 24 hours
 kisi vyakti ke sharir se nikali cheenk kareeb ek meter (3 feet) kii duuri tay karti he
 During this time, if a healthy person is standing about 3 feet away from the swine flu patient, then he can become infected with this virus
 saadhaaran vasteen jaise ki daravaajon ke handle, remote control, hand rells, takiya, computer kaa keyboard jaisi chizon ke bahari bhaag sankramit buundon main sthit virus se sankramit ho sakate hai
 Even if a person touches these surfaces, the virus sitting on their surface can enter his body

 He said that if there was a meeting between the two leaders, then their state president's post would not be vacant for 75 days

 bhartiya loktantr ke pavithratam sthal par hamale ke liye ucchtam nyaayalay se doshi ghoshit or mrityu dand paae aatankwaadi ko faansee par chadha diya gaya
 It is no surprise that his sympathizers are once again making noise about human rights violations
 iskaa jawaab ucchtam nyaayalay ke shabdon main nihit he
 The Hon'ble Court has termed it a 'gruesome' incident in which five heavily armed men killed nine people and injured 16 in indiscriminate firing
 bahut sadhi hui bhashaa main kahen to ye jaane bhi kam keemtee nahin thim
 Those sympathizing with Afzal Guru have their own opinion about the legitimacy of the Indian nation and Kashmir being a part of India, and fortunately most of us do not agree with it
 asahmati kii shaleen had yahaan khatm hoti he
 If any group resorts to violence, then the action of our forces should be counter-productive and not reconciliation
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki jin logon kii chaanbin ho, jin par mukadmaa chale or jinhen doshi ghoshit kiya jaae, unke maanavadhikaron kaa bhi sammaan hona chahie
 But those like Kasab who are caught red-handed or who have been convicted after thorough scrutiny and trial by the judicial system in which we have faith, have no right to receive mercy
 durbhagyavash parivaar kii pidaa kii kahaniyaan sunaakar afjal guru kii faansee ko karunaa mandit kiya ja rahaa he
 We should also shed some tears for those brave ones who sacrificed their lives for the Tricolor that day
 is faansee kii aalochana ko agar atishyokti kii bajaae nirvivaad tathyon kii kasuti par ksaa jaae to iskaa koi auchity nahin he
 The incident occurred in 2001
 mukademe kaa safar bahut lanbaa rahaa-aarope june, 2002 main tay hue; nichali adaalat ne disambar 2002 main faisla sunaaya or ucchtam nyaayalay kaa antim faisla 2005 main aa gaya tha
 If there was a defense argument there was enough time to keep it
 ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle main kuch tathyon par gaur kiya gaya he:2 afjal guru kii taraf se pesh hone ke liye ek vakil kii vyavastha kii gai jo aarope tay hone ke samay maujuud thim
 He admitted that there was enough material to decide the charge
 unke pradarshan kii aalochana ko ucchtam nyaayalay ne khaarij kar diya
 2 After the removal of this lawyer, a second lawyer was appointed, who examined the witnesses
 afjal guru ne khud kuch gavaahon se sawaal puche
 2 It is true that Afzal Guru wanted one of the government lists of four senior lawyers, but they did not want to advocate it
 afjal guru kii taraf se ucchtam nyaayalay main pesh ek jane-maane varisht vakil kaa pehla tark yahi tha ki use uchit kanoonee sahaayta se vanchit rakhaa gaya
 The Supreme Court considered this argument deeply and turned it down
 faisle main yah bhi darj he ki afjal guru chaanbin karne waalon ke haath kaise laga (gilaani ne uskaa naam liya tha), uski bhoomika kya thi, uske khilaaf kya saboot the or phir gaharaai se sochane-samajhane ke baad use doshi tehraane or sunai gai sajaa ko uchit tehra diya gaya
 This lawsuit clearly falls into the category of rarest to rarest
 kisi aparaadh ke aropit vyakti ke maanavadhikaar, adaalat main nishpaksh sunwaayee kii guarantee dete hai
 It is a great misconception that a guilty criminal dissatisfied with the decision of the Supreme Court can appeal to the President of India
 record kii kasuti par dikhne vaali kisi bhul kii gunjaaish vaale faisle par sawaal uthaane kaa ek hi tarika he ki punarvichaar yachika daayar kii jaae or uski sunwaayee vahi nyaayadhish karen (agar ve ritair na hue hon)
 V
 aar
 In Krishna Iyer's words, asking for reconsideration is like 'seeking moon and stars'
 ucchtam nyaayalay kaa faisla isliye antim nahin he ki vah sahi he, balki vah sahi he, isiilie antim he

 Amul has never been an advertising campaign in the traditional sense
 yah hameshaa se ek sapane ke rup main hamaare saamne aata rahaa he jo naram-mulaayam, munh main pani laane jaisaa, jivan main ek baar or phir kabhi nahin jaisaa tajurba-sa kuch he
 Amul's daughter, born of Sylvester Dacunha's thinking and the art of Eustas Fernandes, is 50 years old today, but her childishness and beauty are so full of great blush
 haalanki ham main se kai logon ne dashakon tak use paala-posa, lekin uske asli janak the vargeez courian, jinhen log doodhwaala ke naam se jaanate hai
 If she had not trusted us in the matter of raising her little girl in her own way, she would have died like many other brilliant ideas of advertising
 rachanaatmak logon ke paas aise graahakon kii kami nahin hoti jo sidhe kehete hai bas kar daalo, mujhse pucho mat, or aisa karo jo ''na bhuto, na bhavishyati'' ho
 The existence of Amul Girl and its ever increasing popularity is due to her same milkman
 is tarah amul girl paidaa hui, or phir ek baar chal nikalne ke baad vah thahari nahin
 She changed so fast that no woman could change her mind or a leader's party as fast
 manoranjak, vyangyatmak, mithi churi jaisi bacchee, jisane kabhi kisi kii tarafdaari nahin kii, na hi kisi kaa dil dukhaaya
 She would adapt to Gujarati, Bengali, Marathi, Madrasi as well, becoming similar according to the needs of the locality and subject
 kehete hai na, ''pani re pani tera rang kaisaa, jisamen mila do lage us jaisaa
 He showed it in his many forms
 hamaare akhabaaron se bhi tej uski kaaya badalati rahi or uske chaahane waalon kii taadaad zyaadaatar bollywood sitaron ke prashansakon se bhi zyada ho gai
 He did not preach butter, spreading smiles and joy on people's faces

 K
 lakshmana ke 'kaaman main' ke baad duusare number par vahi thi
 It commented on sports, festivals, fashion, film, every field, but when it comes to politics, no one could comment better
 rashtriya or antarrashtriya donon hi raajnneeti main
 She made a smile by showing the bright side of the dull and hopeless political events
 haryana main mukhyamantri pad ke pratyaashiyon par tanj ho (devi ke bhajan kii bansi baaje, to hari aana amul leki) yaa phir onnai vidaa maten (main tuje nahin chhoduunga) naam kii film main mjiaar ko dikhaate hue usne uskaa naam badalakar vennai vidaa maten (main makkhan ko nahin chhoduunga) kar diya
 Or remember the comment on Sharad Pawar's supremacy - 'it's Autumn All Year round-with Amul'
 yaa phir desh ke chand khubasurat netaaon main se ek rajeev gandhi or unki party ke chikk par-'hand sam vinar-amul'
 When the then Finance Minister presented a tight budget, the child spoke - 'stop VP Ing and sing-amul Butter Costs Less'

 What is the future of UPA, which has ruled the country for nearly 20 months in its second innings
 janata kise piem bananaa chaahati or koun he desh main siem number- van
 After all, what is the mood of the country
 india today ne asi nilsan or oarji maarg ke saath milakar survey kiya to or poocha ki aane vaale dinon main aap pradhanmantri kii kursi par kise dekhnaa chaahate hai to sabase zyada number rahul gandhi ko mili, lekin aankade bataate hai ki rahul kii lokapriyata kaa graph gira he
 As PM Narendra Modi still remains the second choice of the people
 jabaki sonia gandhi tisare number par hai
 That is, the graph of Sonia has also fallen
 laalkrishna adwani ko 7 fisadi log desh kaa piem bananaa chaahate hai
 While Mayawati wants 6 and Nitish Kumar 4 per cent people to hold this position
 is bich pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii lokapriyata apane puraane form main laut ai he
 In this survey, when asked which alliance will vote in the next Lok Sabha elections, more people came in favor of UPA
 lekin ye bhi saaf ho gaya ki loksabhaa main upie kii haalat 2009 ke mukaable kamjor hogi
 On the other hand the graph of NDA is already going up
 is vakt 42 fisadi log maanate hai ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main upie kii vaapasi hogi, jabaki 50 fisadi ko bharosa he rahul pradhanmantri kii gaddi sanbhaalane ke liye taiyaar hai
 In order to know the mood of the country, an important question was about the Chief Ministers
 kaam-kaaj ko lekar jis siem ko sabase zyada pasand kiya ja rahaa he, wo ek baar phir narendra modi hai
 Nitish Kumar, who made a great comeback in Bihar, has also moved up a notch
 jabaki shila dikshit ek seedhi neeche khisak gai hai
 Mayawati continues to be at number four in the list of favorite cms, while Shivraj Singh Chauhan has moved up three places
