 Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has targeted the Modi government at the Center after the passage of a bill to amend the Right to Information (RTI) Act in Parliament
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki bhrashtchaariyon kii madad karne ke liye sarkaar artiai ko kamjor kar rahi he
 Rahul Gandhi tweeted that the government is weakening RTI to help those who escape from India by corrupting and stealing
 yah bhi ajeeb baat he ki bhrashtachar par hallaa machaane vaali bheed achaanak gaayab ho gai he
 Government is diluting RTI in order to help the corrupt steal from India
 Strange that the normally vociferous anti-corruption crowd has suddenly disappeared
 # govtmurdersrti — Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi) July 27, 2019 Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has also supported Rahul Gandhi's statement
 unhone rahul ke samarthan main twit kiy, endie sarkaar ne artiai ko kamjor karke desh kaa bada nuksaan kiya he
 Under the UPA, a culture of accountability was developed because of this act, but the NDA certainly opposes it

 The government now wants to change this system
 sanshodhan bill main kaha gaya he ki soochna ayuktaon kaa kaarykaal sarkaar nirdhaarit karegi
 The opposition says that when the government decides the term, the independence of the commissioners will be affected
 2- artiai sanshodhan bill paas hone par vetan or bhatte tay karne kaa adhikaar bhi centre sarkaar ko mil jayega
 Whereas the original law made in 2005 provides that the Election Commission rules will be applicable in the salary, allowances and service conditions of the Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners at the Central level

 'dinar vid kejariwal' or 'lunch vid kejariwal' ke baad ab apni chanda jutao muhim ke tahat aam aadmi party 'coffee vid kejariwal' kaarykram lekar ai he
 Former Delhi Law Minister and now party candidate from Malviya Nagar, Somnath Bharti, has organized the event on Saturday for the purpose of raising funds for the party for the assembly elections 2015
 is kaarykram ke tahat arvind kejariwal ke saath chaay-coffee pine kii chaah rakhane vaale sabhi log aa sakate hai, lekin iske liye kam se kam 20,000 rupee dene honge
 The Aam Aadmi Party's fundraising event has been a hit so far, and around 10 such events have been organized in Delhi, and the party intends to organize similar programs in every assembly constituency
 party ke mutabik, chande se juta paisa usee vidhansabha kshetra ke sthaneey sanghathan ko jaataa he
 About 20 lakhs are being collected from each such program, which will be very helpful in terms of election expenses of the candidate of the same assembly constituency
 party ke anusaar, abhi tak in kaaryakramon se party kul chaar karod rupee jamaa kar chuki he
 Senior Aam Aadmi Party leader Sanjay Singh says, "we are doing everything cleanly and are not hiding anything, and this is clear with our program
 
 
 abhi tak to ham dinar-lunch-chaay-coffee ke badale chanda maang rahe hai, lekin kal yah bhi ho saktaa he ki ham aap logon ko bina dinar-lunch-chaay-coffee ke logon se meeting karke chanda jutate mil jaaen
 
 
 '' aam aadmi party aise aayojan se ek tir se teen shikaar kar rahi he
 First she is raising money, second she is showing how transparent her fundraising method is and third she is showing that her leader and her CM candidate in Delhi are still so popular
 kyonki asal main lunch-dinar chaay copy ke liye log nahin jutate balki wo arvind kejariwal se milane ke liye jutate hai

 ' rajyasabha main prashnkaal ke dauraan jab grih mantralay se sawaal puche gaye to in sawaalon ke jawaab grih rajya mantri nityanand raay or kishan reddy ne die
 This was the first time that the two ministers were answering the question hour like this
 gauratlab he ki us samay rajya sabha main grahamantri amit shah bhi maujuud the, lekin unhone mauka donon yuva mantriyon ko diya
 The Chairman appreciated this move of Home Minister Amit Shah and said that for the first time in the Question Hour, the young leaders were answering it is a good thing that the Home Minister gave them a chance
 sabhi saansadon ne 29 rajya mantriyon ke sammaan main mej bhi thapthapai
 Responding to Rajkumar Dhoot's question 125, Nityanand Rai said that in the context of the fire incident at the Gujarat Coaching Center, the central government's job is to alert the state government
 samay-samay par centre sarkaar baqayda rajyon ko adwijuri jari karti he ki fire sefti ke kya maanak hone chahie? centre ne isamen apana 80 pratishat yogadan badhaayaa he or ab iskaa bajet lagbhag 21,000 karod kar diya he
 At the same time, Minister of State Kishan Reddy answered two questions in which information was sought for the creation of new forensic labs across the country
 kishan reddy ne bataaya ki pune, bhopal or guwahati main nae lab banaae ja rahe hai
 Whether a new lab will be built for Bihar? 
 
 is sawaal ke jawaab jab rajya mantri ne kolkata ke lab kaa hawala diya to amit shah ne unako yaad dilaayaa ki kolkata kaa jonal lab arab bihar samet aasapaas ke tamaam pradeshon ke maamalon ko cover karegaa
 In the end, Amit Shah himself thought it appropriate to answer a tricky case
 jab congress saansad piel puniya ke daliton-adivaasiyon par ho rahe utpeedan se jude maamle par grih mantralay se sawaal poocha, 'jammu-kashmir par aapkaa khaas dhyaan he meraa sawaal he ki kya privansion of atrocity act jammu kashmir main bhi lagu kiya jayega?' to is sawaal kaa jawaab dene ke liye amit shah khud khadey hue or unhone aashwaasan diya ki jammu-kashmir prashasan se vichaar-vimarsh karke vah is bare main kuch bataa sakenge
 Significantly, during the Question Hour nowadays, Chairman Venkaiah Naidu himself is present and it is emphasized that more and more questions should be completed
 yahi vajah he ki venkaiya naidu baar-baar mantriyon ko bhi sankshep main jawaab dene kaa aagrah karte rahe

 There are no more days left in the most exciting series of Test cricket
 
 
 bharat or australia ke bich test series kaa pehla muqabla 4 disambar se brisben main shuru hone ja rahaa he
 
 
 But even before Team India left for the tour, the Australian camp has started putting psychological pressure on India
 
 
 australia ke purv tej gendbaaz glen maikgra ke mutabik, mejabaan australian team mehmaan bharat ko clin sweep se haraayegi
 
 
 Apparently, Glenn mcgrath has been an intelligent minded cricketer, so if he is saying something he will have his own reasons
 
 
 varsh 1985 se ab tak bharat ne australia main 23 test match khele hai, lekin unamem se mahaj do match jeetne main kamyaabi hasil kar paae hai
 India also won these two Test matches when legendary batsmen like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman were present in Team India, but this time there is no such reliable batsman in Team India
 
 
 vaise, series shuru hone se pehle donon hi timen ek jaisi mushkil se guzar rahi hai, kyonki bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni brisben test se pehle feet nahin ho paaenge, or udhar, vahiin maaikel clark kaa bhi pehle mukaable main khelnaa tay nahin he
 
 
 Not only this, the Australian team's performance against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi was very average, while the West Indies team's departure was incomplete and the team India did not get a chance to practice Test matches
 
 
 in sab paristhitiyon ke baavjood khelpremiyon ko bharosa he ki donon tiimon ke bich behad romaanchak series dekhne ko milegi or is bharose kii vajah he donon tiimon main behad talented khilaadiyon kii maujuudagi
 
 
 However, the table is certainly overwhelming for Australia, as the Indian team lacks experienced batsmen, and anyway they have traditionally not been able to play the bounce and seam very well
 
 
 jabaki duusari ore, australia ke paas mishael johnson, rayaan haris or peter sidle ke rup main behtareen gendbaazon kii tikdi maujuud he
 
 
 Team India selected for the tour of Australia will also face a very difficult challenge, because this team has been chosen keeping the World Cup in mind, not taking into account the Test matches
 
 
 so, australian pichon par australian gendbaazon kaa saamana karnaa mushkil to he, lekin rohit sharma, viraat kohli, shikhar dhawan or cheteshwar pujaara jaise ballebaazon main mushkil chunauti ko aasaan banane kaa madda bhi he

 i am not a Hindu and i may not ever be
 usee tarah main muslim, isai, yahudee, buddha, jain yaa sikh bhi nahin hum
 It is also unlikely that i will ever become one of them
 lekin main maanati hum ki mujhe in mahaan paramparaon ke vishay main jaanane, inaki prashansa or in par vichaar manthan karne kaa adhikaar he
 These great traditions teach me what it means to be human, how to live our life in the world, how our actions should be
 ve mrityu ke vishay main or mrityu ke baad kya hoga, uske bare main mujhe jo sikhaate hai, mujhe usamen ruchi he
 i can honestly say that every religion has enriched me, which i do not follow, perhaps Hinduism has contributed the most among them
 yah satya he ki yahaan-vahaan jo kuch bhi mujhe aakarshith karata he, main use grahan kar leti hum (buddha dharm se karunaa, yahudee dharm se nyaay ke liye aagrah, islam se apni aamadani kaa ek hissaa anivaary rup se garibon main baantnaa)
 In this way i try to choose a harmonious and ethical way of living my life
 lekin yah sab to maine kahin na kahin se ber kii tarah chunaa he
 Hinduism forces me to interview with my being — it makes me think about how i want to be in my everyday life
 jab mujhe lagane lagata he ki main sarvshereshth hum, tab karm or dharm kaa vichaar mujhe mere karmon se avgat karakar mujhe us par manthan ko protsaahit karata he
 Most of them remind me that the actions that i am doing, the results that will be done, will have an effect on others besides me
 karm or dharm ke bich kaa utkrisht loch, hindu dharm ke hriday main basataa he
 Every action will have some consequences
 isliye ham jo kar rahe hai vah kyon kar rahe hai, uskaa aadhaar kya he, in baton par hindu dharm gahan manthan karata he
 However, we may not be aware that as soon as we choose a karma for ourselves, along with it, every moment in our life many new responsibilities are added
 udhaaharan ke liye ham ek hi samay par maatayen or betiyaan or bahanen or patniyaan, mitra or shikshikaayen or naukari dene vaali, sab kuch hai
 In this way we have social, family, occupational roles
 inamen se har bhoomika ke liye hamen ek nishchit vyavhaar kaa anusaran karne kii jarurat hoti he, saath hi hamase kuch khaas apekshaayen bhi hoti hai
 If we crave to be called "good", then every role will force us to run in a particular way
 ramayana main dasharath ek raja the, ek pita the or ek pati bhi the
 The boon that Kaikeyi asked for on that traumatic night before the coronation of Shriram led to a tremendous confrontation between all these sides of Dasaratha's life at the same time
 agar dasharath ek bhoomika kaa uchit nirvahan karte hai, to duusari bhoomika main vah jin uttaradayitvon se bandhe the, unka atikaraman hona tay tha
 Dasaratha, fulfilling his wife's wishes, opted to call himself a "good" husband by giving Rama 14 years of exile
 usee samay vah ek raja or ek pita ke rup main apane karmon se munh mode gaye
 Dasaratha did not live long with his deeds
 apane priy putr ke van jane ke turant baad dasharath ne praan tyaag die
 On the other hand, Rama, after returning from Ayodhya, spent a lifetime with the consequences of the act of abandoning his wife and sending her to the forest
 ham jo karnaa chaahate hai or hamen jo karnaa chahie, uske bich ek santulan sthapit karnaa, manushya hone kaa sabase bada dharmsankat he
 There is an intellectual, mythological and philosophical explanation of this crisis in Hinduism
 mahakavyon main devgan hamen in moulik maanviya bhramon se baahar nikaalte hai
 i think of Krishna's pithy dialogue with Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita that concludes to a reasonable conclusion with the manifestation of his most beautiful divine form of God and a visions of this divine form of a human being
 gita maanav karm kii duvidha ko sabase adhik pramukhataa detii he, haalanki iske kuch anshon ko main puri tarah se samaj nahin pai hum or main saamaanya vyavhaar ke aise kisi bhi niyam kaa samarthan nahin karti jo saamaajik anukramon (kshatriya dharm) ke aadhaar par tay kiye jaaen
 Still, i am moved by thinking about Arjun's dilemma, what must be going on in his mind when he has two equally painful options
 krishna arjuna ko unke bare main bodh karaate hai, arjuna se jin karmon kii apeksha he unke bare main abhas karakar krishna, ek arth main arjuna ko dharmsankat se baahar nikaalte hai
 When i am facing difficult situations in my personal life, i want the same kind of clarity for myself — the ability to rise above my present and see myself in a vast landscape
 yah jaanakar mujhe dhants mila he ki aisi spashtataa sambhav he, chaahe vah ishwar kii ore se mili athwa apane bheetar upji ek nai samaj se aae
 Even thinking about what has happened to us in the last decades, there is a lot of pain in place of anger
 jis vaalmik ramayana ke saath maine tees varsh bitaye hai, is granth ko lekar koun baat kar saktaa he or kya baat kar saktaa he, aisi bandishen thopi ja rahi hai
 We are often hearing in a much louder voice that there is only one Ramayana (and, as it has been, it is not Valmik); No one, other than Indians, has the right to say anything about it; No one other than the Hindu can be allowed to ponder what the narrative and its characters might mean; The right to be emotional by imagining what kind of sufferings Rama and Sita and others have to face while living in the human world, apart from a believer Hindu and none other than a devotee, and true love to Rama Do not have the right to do
 rajnatik rup se prerit shahari thag jo samskruti ke pahrue ban baithe hai, ve dhamkiyon or shaareerik hinsa se aisi bandishen balpurvak thope rahe hai
 The most disturbing thing is the growing clout of nationalists in the intellectual world who have been accusing Western scholars of being the gatekeepers of Hindutva (allegedly displaying India's location and outlook inferiorly), now the same religion and more Has become the guardian of all things connected
 ye aakraamak saanskrithik rashtravaadi, hindu dharm ke swayambhu rakshak ban baithe hai
 We 1
 3 arab kah sakate hai ki hindu dharm bahultavaadi hai lekin hindutv vicitra he
 This distinction becomes meaningless when the new local gatekeepers of Hinduism and ardent supporters of Hindu Rashtra declare that by reaching that vast treasure of human thoughts and experiences, they can only take advantage of what they will allow
 main vah kahani sunate hue badi hui hum jisamen mujhe bataaya gaya ki chand ko gaur se dekhogi to usamen kisi aadmi kaa aks najar aayega
 When i started studying Sanskrit, i came to know that the moon is an antelope, the antelope is in its lap
 lekin 2018 kii poornima par ab main keval mrug hi dekh sakati hum

 bataa den ki jammu-kashmir kii mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti se mulaakaat ke baad jaayra ko kuch kuch logon ne trol kiya tha
 After this, Zaira wrote an apology on Monday
 haalanki jaayra kii is post ke baad bollywood unke saport main aa khadaa hua
 Aamir Khan also tweeted in his favor in which he appealed to people to leave 16-year-old Zaira alone
 unhone apni apil main kaha ki jaayra ko unki jindagi jeene deni chahie
 Mehbooba Mufti said - Zaira is a role model, but BJP leader and Union Minister Vijay Goel tweeted on January 19, linking the same issue with a painting exhibition, which Dangal girl Zaira Wasim did not like at all

 The Congress made a mistake years ago by tying up with # BSP in Uttar Pradesh
 tab se aisi pity ki aaj tak nahin uth pai
 We are making the same mistake in Maharashtra

 is gupha kaa mahatv isliye bhi he kyonki isi gupha main bhagwaan shiv ne apni patni devi parvati ko amartv kaa mantra sunaaya tha
 It is believed that Lord Shiva resides in the Shiva Amarnath cave
 panchatarani main kiya paanchon tatwon kaa parityagabhagwan shiv jab parvati ko amarkatha sunaane le ja rahe the, tab unhone raste main sabase pehle pahalgam main apane nandi (bail) kaa parityag kiya
 After this, he freed the moon from his jata at Chandanbadi
 sheshnag naamak jhil par pahunch kar unhone gale se sarpon ko bhi utaar diya
 He also decided to leave beloved son Shri Ganesh ji on Mount Mahagunas
 phir panchatarani naamak sthaan par pahunch kar bhagwaan shiv ne paanchon tatwon kaa parityag kiya
 According to the successful scriptures, Lord Shiva told the secret of immortality to Goddess Parvati in this cave
 mata parvati ke saath hi is rahasy ko shuk (tota) or do kabutaron ne bhi sun liya tha
 This shuk was later immortalized as a shukdev sage, while many devotees still see a pair of pigeons in the cave that are considered immortal birds
 puraanon ke anusaar kaashi main darshan se das guna, prayag se sau guna or naimisharany se hajaar guna punya dene vaale shri baba amarnath kaa darshan he
 Parvati Peeth is also located here
 The ice Shivalinga built inside the Amarnath cave is made of hard ice, while raw snow is seen everywhere for miles outside the cave
 manyata yah bhi he ki gupha ke upar parvat par shri ram kunda he
 Parvati Peeth is one of the 51 Shakti Peethas located in Sri Amarnath Cave
 manyata he ki yahaan bhagwati sati kaa kanth bhaag gira tha
 According to beliefs, according to legend, Lord Shankar himself visits Shri Amarnath cave on the full moon day of Raksha Bandhan
 raksha bandhan kii poornima ke din hi chadi mubarak bhi gupha main bane him shivlinga ke paas sthapit kar di jaati he
 It is believed that mere sight of snow Shivling inside the Amarnath cave gives a person equal to the virtue of 23 holy pilgrimages

 The capital has changed in Delhi, the capital of the country, with the change in the secretariat
 isi ke saath hukmaranon kii niyat or niti bhi badalane lagi he
 Sheila Dixit, after ruling Delhi for 15 years, has now shifted from the headquarters of power
 dilli main raajnneeti ne ek nai karavat lee he or nae mukhyamantri banane ja rahe arvind kejariwal bhrashtachar virdohi lahar par savaar hokar mukhyamantri kii kursi tak pahunche hai or aage bhi ve bhrashtachar se ladane kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 It will take some more time for Kejriwal to sit on the Chief Minister's chair
 lekin dilli sachivalay main to vakt se pehle hi tamaam kursiyaan hilne lagi hai
 Till date, it has been found out that the files and documents are being destroyed in the staff of ministers and many secret departments
 chun-chunakar filon se kaagaj nikaalkar phaade ja rahe hai or afasaron kii megen or aalmaariyaan saaf kii ja rahi hai
 Till date, as soon as the intelligence team entered the office of Arvinder Singh Lovely, a domineering minister of the Sheila government, the view there was shocking
 dilli sachivalay main arvinder singh ke officer on special duty (oesady) navani ke offis main bhrashtachar mitaane vaale jhaadu se sabooton ko mitaayaa ja rahaa he
 Lovely is out of the Delhi Secretariat, but OSD Saheb's staff is busy cleaning files
 filon kii safai main vyast lavali ke oesady aaj tak kii team ko dekhakar pehle to sakapaka gaye
 Then after some time he normalized himself
 jab unase poocha gaya ki daftar main filein kyon phadi ja rahi hai to oesady sahab bilkul anjaan ban gaye
 His colleagues came out on white lies
 unhone kaha ki daftar main koi file nahin phadi ja rahi he
 Perhaps he did not know that evidence of tearing of government documents had already been captured on camera
 sachivalay main ek taraf sarkari filein phadi ja rahi hai to duusari taraf mukhyamantri offis main tainaat kai afasar kejariwal ke dar se apana transfar karaane ke liye pareshaan hai
 No one else but the staff of the Secretariat is saying this with their mouths
 dilli jal board main bah rahi he bhrashtachar kii gangadilli ke jhandevalaan ilaake main dilli jal board kaa mukhyalay he
 Gangotri in Delhi explodes from the Delhi Jal Board headquarters in Jhandewalan
 yah offis hajaaron karod ke bhrashtachar ke liye badnaam he or yahaan kai tarah ke ghapale arvind kejariwal ne khud ujagar kiye the
 It is a coincidence that Arvind Kejriwal, who exposed corruption here, is now going to own this building
 bataur mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal hi dilli jalboard ke bhi adhyaksh honge
 In Delhi Jal Board, corruption has been disclosed by many big officers, but the most important disclosure has been made by the Delhi Jal Board's biggest officer i
e
 CEO of PA
 jal board main ek-ek aadmi ke paas ek-ek, do-do gaadiyaan hai, head clerk bhi gaadi lekar gum rahe hai
 Not only this, according to PA, the story of corruption goes even further
 doctor e
 K
 ambasht jal board ke mukhya satarkta adhikari yani sivio hai
 Ambush has already accepted in question that there is corruption in Delhi Jal Board and this is also true
 sivio ne khulaasa kiya ki pehle kii head yani purv siem ne privet aadamiyon se haath mila rakhe the or kejariwal ke aane par shaayad ye parampara toote
 The CVO said that the Delhi Jal Board is dominated by private contractors and was fueled by politicians
 dilli jal board main jo bhi bache-khuche imaan vaale afasar hai, wo kejariwal kaa besabri se intjaar kar rahe hai
 On the other hand, the officers who have been accused of corruption have a stir
 sach to ye he ki kejariwal kaa dar ab sabko sata rahaa he
 Kejriwal has promised that he will provide 700 liters of free water daily to every family
 jaahir he ki jal board main failaa bhrashtachar agar rukaa to kejariwal ke liye apana vaada puraa karnaa mumkin ho paaegaa
 Now the water board officials are also eyeing Kejriwal
 aspataalon kaa ilaaj karenge kejariwal, ditisi main bhi hadakampaaisa nahin he ki kejariwal kaa dar sirf sachivalay or dilli sarkaar ke mukhyalayon main hi nahin, balki un aspataalon main bhi he, jinhen kejariwal chalaayenge
 CMO at Delhi's Guru Tegbahadur Hospital was in the mood for Christmas
 unhen jaise hi bataaya gaya ki kejariwal muyne ke liye aspataal aa sakate hai to siemo turant harakat main aa gaye
 The CMO spoke on the phone and said that if i tell Kejriwal's arrival to the chief of the hospital, ie the Medical Superintendent, then his heartbeat will be accelerated
 kejariwal kaa naam lene par dilli ke ek motor licencing officer khud ko kejariwal se bhi bada bataane lage
 He said that he is fighting corruption like a bull
 samaaj kalyaan vibhaag main bhi kejariwal ke naam par hadakamp he or afasar maan rahe hai ki bhrasht adhikariyon par gaaj girane vaali he
 There are other officials too, who are calling themselves supporters of the Aam Aadmi Party and believe that Kejriwal's arrival will make a difference somewhere
 ditisi ke adhikari bhi kejariwal ko lekar hairaan or pareshaan hai

 morgen stanley ke mutabik china ke aarthik aankadon se saaf he ki uski mudra bazaar dar se adhik aanki hui thi or vah vaastavik exange rate ke nikat yuan ko sthapit karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 At the same time, experts believe that China is trying to include its currency in the Reserve Asset (special Dry Rights) of the International Monetary Fund
 is koshish main safal hone par dollar, euro, yen or pounds kii tarj par yuan bhi ek antarrashtriya mudra kii tarj par apni pahchaan bana legaa
 The rupee fell to a two-year low on Wednesday on the global Forex market, falling to a two-year low
 haalanki morgen stanley kaa maananaa he ki bharat aarthik sudhaaron kii taraf aage bad rahaa he or aane vaale dinon main bharat kii sthiti majboot hoti dikhaai degi
 Although the risk of tolerating risk in the Indian economy remains stable at the moment, it may increase the difficulty of bringing more investment in the country
 iske chalate bhartiya mudra main giravat bhi dekhne ko mil sakati he
 However, according to Morgan Stanley, the Indian rupee is in a better position against other Asian currencies
 shrunkhlaa pehle hi apane naam kar chukaa bharat ravivaar ko england ke khilaaf hone vaale mahaj aupchaarikta ke paanchaven or antim ekadivasiy cricket match main jeet ke saath shrunkhlaa kaa ant karnaa chahega
 While a 4–1 win in the series may not heal the wounds of the loss in the Test series against England, Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team India's morale will certainly increase before the Test series against Michael Clarke's Australian team
 captain dhoni bhi kaaphi acha mahasoos kar rahe honge, kyonki unhone siries main acha pradarshan kiya he or adhik jimmedaari bharaa khel dikhaaya he
 Dhoni would surely like that when India landed at the 43rd international venue of the country, the Indian team would retain the form of the last three matches, where they easily defeated the opposing team
 bharat pehle hi shrunkhlaa main 3-1 kii nirnaayak badhat le chukaa he, jisase ravivaar ko hone vaala match mahaj aupchaarikta kaa he, lekin team prabandhan or rashtriya chayankartaaon ko kuch vibhaagon par dhyaan dena hoga
 Cheteshwar Pujara is awaiting his ODI debut and the Saurashtra batsman may finally get this chance, as he has not even been released for the Ranji Trophy final against Mumbai
 dhoni aamtaur par jaanche-parakhe sangyojan ke saath utarane ko hi tarjeeh dete hai or ise dekhte hue yah dekhnaa rochak hoga ki ab tak bainch par baithe rahane vaale pujaara or amit mishra ko apana kaushal dikhaane kaa mauka miltaa he yaa nahin
 In the last match, the captain had played the stakes to start the innings with Rohit Sharma, which went on
 ise dekhte hue duusare salaami ballebaaj gautam gambhir par dabaav bad gaya he or dilli ke is ballebaaj ko maukey kaa puraa phayda uthaanaa hoga, kyonki shaayad unhen aage adhik mauk nahin mili
 The comments pehle teen vanade main badi pari khilne main vifal rahe ajinkya rahane ko bhale hi pichley match main antim ekadash se baahar hona padaa ho, lekin is yuva khilaadi ko bhavishya main or maukey milane kii ummid he
 If Rohit fits into the role of the opener and decides to give Rahane more chances, Gambhir may possibly have the last chance in limited-overs matches for some time to come
 suresh raina achche finishr kii bhoomika main khare utarane lage hai, jabaki viraat kohli ranchi jaisi pari khelkar siries kaa acha ant karnaa chahenge
 The final match of the series could not have been played better than Dharamshala, one of the most beautiful cricket grounds in the world and competes against either Newtown's Cape Town or Queenstown's John Davis Oval
 shrunkhlaa main 4-1 kii jeet ke saath bhale hi england ke khilaaf test shrunkhlaa main haar ke ghaav nahin bharenge, lekin nishchit taur par maaikel clark kii australian team ke khilaaf test siries se pehle mahendra singh dhoni kii team india kaa manobal badhegaa
 Captain Dhoni must have been feeling quite good too, as he has done well in the series and has shown more responsibility
 dhoni nishchit taur par chahenge ki bharat jab desh ke 43wein antarrashtriya aayojan sthal par utre, to bhartiya team pichley teen maichon kii form ko barkaraar rakhe, jahaan usne virdohi team ko aasaani se haraaya
 India have already taken a decisive 3–1 lead in the series, making Sunday's match a mere formality, but the team management and national selectors will have to focus on certain departments
 cheteshwar pujaara ko ekadivasiy padaarpan kaa intjaar he or saurashtra ke is ballebaaj ko antat: yah mauka mil saktaa he, kyonki unhen mumbai ke khilaaf ranjai trophy final ke liye bhi relies nahin kiya gaya he
 Dhoni usually prefers to come up with a tested combination and it will be interesting to see if Pujara and Amit Mishra, who have been sitting on the bench so far, get a chance to show their skills
 captain ne pichley match main rohit sharma se pari kii shuruyaat karne kaa daanv khelaa tha, jo chal padaa
 In view of this, the pressure has increased on the second opener Gautam Gambhir and this Delhi batsman will have to take full advantage of the opportunity, because he might not get much opportunity ahead
 tippaniyan Ajinkya Rahane, who failed to play big innings in the first three odis, may have been out of the playing XI in the last match, but this young player is expected to get more opportunities in the future
 agar rohit salaami ballebaaj kii bhoomika main feet ho jate hai or rahane ko or adhik maukey dene kaa faisla kiya jaataa he, to sambhavat: gambhir ke paas aane vaale kuch samay ke liye simit overon ke maichon main antim mauka ho saktaa he
 Suresh Raina has started playing the role of a good finisher, while Virat Kohli would like to end the series with an innings like Ranchi
 shrunkhlaa kaa antim match dharmashala se behatar jagah nahin khelaa ja saktaa tha, jo duniya ke sabase khabasurat cricket maidaanon main se ek hai or newlands ke capatoun yaa queenstown ke jon davis ovel ko takkar detaa he

 narendra modi ne ravivaar ko bijepi chunaav prachaar samiti ke adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya
 Party President Rajnath Singh took command of the party's election campaign committee
 beete 13 sitambar ko bijepi kaa pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaae gaye modi ne aaj party ke sansadeey board kii baithak main chunaav prachaar samiti ke pramukh pad ke liye rajnath ke naam kaa prastaav diya
 BJP general secretary Anant Kumar said, 'modi proposed Rajnath Singh's name and all the members of the parliamentary board accepted it unanimously
 ' party netaaon ne kaha ki unka nirnay apekshit tha, kyonki modi apana prachaar khud ko nahin kar sakate the
 Kumar said that with 20 sub-committees already formed under the Election Campaign Committee, it was only appropriate that Rajnath Singh be made the head of the committee
 up-samitiyon kii adhyakshata alag-alag varisht netaa kar rahe hai
 It is worth noting that while today's decision was peaceful, there was a lot of ruckus on the appointment of Modi as the head of the election campaign committee at the BJP General Assembly held in Goa on 9 June
 varisht netaa laal krishna adwani or sushamaa swaraj ke aitraaj ke baavjood modi ko prachaar samiti kaa pramukh banaaya gaya tha
 Advani even resigned from all positions of the opposition party but withdrew his resignation after the intervention of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat
 kareeb 17 saal tak rajg ke ghatak dal rahe jadyu ne gathbandhan se naata tod liya tha, kyonki use ashanka thi ki modi kii tarakkee se uske muslim voter usase dur chale jaaenge
 The ordinance brought on the issue of convicted mps and mlas was also discussed in the meeting of the Parliamentary Board today
 kumaar ne kaha ki party bharat ke raashtrapati se is par hastakshar nahin karne kaa anurodh karti he
 The Board also discussed the right of voters to dismiss and said that with this the issue of compulsory voting comes on its own
 bijepi ne kaha ki is mudde par charchaa ke liye ek sarvadaleey baithak bulaai jaani chahie
 a day before the nomination, Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Narendra Modi) will do a big road show (PM Modi Road Show) in Varanasi today

 jaankaree ke mutabik, hemanth viswa or keje alphons dopaher 1 baje rajyapal se mulaakaat kar sakate hai
 Congress does not want to repeat the mistake The Congress, which emerged as the largest party in Meghalaya, does not want to repeat its mistakes in Goa and Manipur
 yahi kaaran he ki meghalaya ke nattejey aane se pehle hi congress party ne apane teen varisht netaaon ahamed patel, kamalnath or mukul vaasanic ko dilli se shilong ke liye ravaanaa kar diya tha
 After coming to Shillong, these three leaders started preparing a strategy to form the Congress government in Meghalaya

 The Israeli company expressed regret over India's decision
 kuch hi dinon main israeli pradhanmantri benjamin netanyahu apni pehali bharat yatra par aane vaale hai

 priyanka gandhi wadra ko congress kaa mahasachiv banaae jane ke baad se hi virdohi dalon ke netaaon ke alag-alag bayaan saamne aa rahe hai
 Now Madhya Pradesh BJP MLA Rameshwar Sharma has targeted the Gandhi family
 unhone kaha he ki gandhi parivaar lagaataar jyotiraditya sindhiya kii upeksha kar rahaa he
 Priyanka Gandhi has been given the command of Eastern Uttar Pradesh by making Congress General Secretary, while Jyotiraditya Scindia has been given the responsibility of West UP by making party General Secretary
 'ajtak' se baat karte hue bhopal kii hujur vidhansabha seat se vidhayak rameshwar sharma ne kaha, 'lagaataar kaam karne vaale kaaryakarta kii jab upeksha hoti he to us par vichaar karnaa padataa he
 Jyotiraditya Scindia is in constant struggle after the death of Madhavrao Scindia
 pehle unhen lag rahaa tha ki pitaaji kii maut ke baad unhen uchit sthaan milegaa, lekin aisa nahin hua
 When Jyotiraditya Scindia was inducted into the Union Cabinet, he got the status of Minister of State
 'aage rameshwar sharma ne kaha ki congress ke kai vidhayak bhi maang kar rahe the ki sindhiya ko pradesh adhyaksh banaaya jaae
 But even then he was not made the state president
 ab jab sindhiya ko mahasachiv banaaya to saath main priyanka gandhi kaa naam hone se vah badhai ke postaron tak se gaayab ho gaye
 Rameshwar Sharma said that 'it is clear that Jyotiraditya Scindia was sacrificed
 ''bahan-bhai ke gulam ban gaye sindhiya'- bijepi vidhayakiske baad rameshwar sharma ne bada aarope lagaate hue kaha ki 'jyotiraditya sindhiya ko naa publicity mili or naa pad kii garima
 First brother had slaves and now sister-brother's slaves
 ' vidhayak sharma ne sawaal poocha ki 'madhya pradesh ke leader or ek khandaani leader ke saath ye durvyavhaar kyon ho rahaa he
 It should be considered
 'gauratlab he ki priyanka gandhi ke aupchaarik rup se raajnneeti main aane ke baad se hi bijepi hamalavar he
 Many veteran BJP leaders have made controversial comments on Priyanka
 yogi adityanath sarkaar main mantri upendra tiwari ne bhi priyanka or rahul gandhi ko lekar vivaadit bayaan diya tha
 Senior BJP leader Vijayvargiya has also made controversial statements against Priyanka
 pashchim bengal ke bijepi prabharee kailash vijayawargeey ne kaha ki kabhi koi congress netaa maang karata he ki karina kapur ko bhopal se loksabhaa chunaav ladvaya jaae, to kabhi indore se chunavi ummidavaari ko lekar salmaan khan ke naam par charchaa kii jaati he
 Similarly, Priyanka is brought into active Congress politics
 unhone kaha ki agle loksabhaa chunaav ke maidan main utaarne ke liye congress ke paas majboot netaa nahin hai
 So she wants to contest through such chocolatey faces
 agar congress main rahul gandhi ke netritv ke prati aatmavishvaas hota, to priyanka ko sakriy raajnneeti main nahin laayaa jaataa

" ’’adwani samarthak gut se jude hone kii chhavi vaale goyal ne kaha, ‘‘modi ji desh main party ke sabase lokapriy netaa hai
 The party has certainly given special importance to him by leading the election campaign committee
 ’’haalanki modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa daavedaar kehane se ve kanni kaat gaye
 Recently, on the question of removing a vice president of Delhi BJP from the party for criticizing Modi, Goyal said, "no one has the right to publicly criticize the party leader
 ’’ unhone modi or adwani ke bich kisi tarah kaa matbhed hone kii baat ko bhi sire se nakaar diya
 On the question of himself being the chief ministerial candidate from BJP, Goyal said, "the party will decide the claim, but this election will be fought under my leadership
" ’’unhone arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party kii chunauti ko sire se khaarij karte hue kaha ki yah abhi nai party he or abhi to unhen sanghathanaatmak dhaancha khadaa karne main vakt lagegaa

 Amid the political rhetoric going on in the electoral atmosphere, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has instructed the leaders of his party
 gujarat congress ke netaaon ko taakid kii gai he ki wo chunaav prachaar ke dauraan shabdon kii garima kaa dhyaan rakhen
 Actually, this order from Rahul Gandhi's office has been given in relation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 rahul ne gujarat congress ke netaaon ko aadesh diya he ki wo piem modi par nijee hamale naa karen
 At the same time, he has also asked the leaders to desist from inappropriate words
 rahul gandhi ke daftar se soobe ke chunaav prabharee or congress ke rashtriya mahasachingshok gahalotako is sambandh main suchit kiya gaya he
 Through Gehlot, all party leaders and workers of Gujarat have been asked to send these messages
 bataa den ki gujarat vidhansabha chunaav disambar main hone hai
 Before that, political mercury has been continuously increasing in the state
 donon pramukh dalon bijepi or congress ke netaa jor-shor se prachaar main jute hai
 In such a situation, keeping in view the dignity of the Prime Minister, Rahul Gandhi has issued an advisory to avoid the use of abuses against him
 haalanki, iske peeche siyaasi myne bhi hai
 The Congress does not want the discussion to divert from the issues on which it dominates the BJP in Gujarat
 duusari vajah ye bhi he ki ateet main congress netaaon ke bayaan unke gale kii haddi ban chuke hai
 In the 2007 assembly elections after the Gujarat riots, Congress President Sonia Gandhi made a statement about the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 sonia ne 'maut kaa saudagar' kaha tha, jiske baad us par kaaphi vivaad hua tha
 In such a situation, Rahul does not want to shock the atmosphere towards him in the Gujarat elections and the BJP should attack the Congress on the basis of any statement

 raajnneeti kii bisaat par kya ramdev janandolan khadaa kar paaenge yaa unka andolan bhi anna ke anshan kii tarah aundhe munh giregaa
 Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev will answer these questions from the stage itself
 pichley june main dilli ke ramlila maidan main sarkari doodh se jaale baba ramdev is baar chhaanch bhi phoonk-foonkkar pi rahe hai, isiilie andolan se 3 din pehle gujarat ke karamsad main ekantavaas ke naam par bhi sarkaar kii neend haraam karne kaa kaam hi karte rahe
 At present, Swami Ramdev has thrown 3 issues missile towards the government
 pehla mudda janalokapal, doosraa mudda sibiai kii swaittata or teesraa mudda kaala dhan kaa he
 Swami Ramdev has made complete preparations for his movement at Ramlila Maidan
 ramlila maidan main 30 hajaar logon ke liye intjaam kiya gaya he

 Ramdev and his supporters believe that riding on this frills, their movement will be able to penetrate the government fort, but the question is what will be the character of Ramdev's movement
 ramdev ne abtak saaf nahin kiya he ki wo anshan par baithenge yaa aamaran anshan par yaa phir dharna dekar sarkaar ke kaanon tak apana virodh pahunchaayenge
 It is also not clear how long and in what form their movement will run
 jaahir he ki apane makasad main kaamyaab hone ke liye ramdev ko ek lambii dagar tay kerani hogi
 Ramdev's movement that started with black money has now reached the demand of autonomy from Janlokpal to cbbai, but how the outline of this movement will be is not clear
 ramdev bhi apane pattey khol nahin rahe hai
 When Swami Ramdev met the media, confusion arose whether it was Ramdev's agenda or Anna Hazare's

 ye swami ramdev ko bhi maaloom he ki is baar sarkaar un par palatwaar kaa koi mauka chukne vaali nahin
 Has Baba Ramdev started to sing the praises of Narendra Modi only to avoid the attack of power? Who does not know that the strongest defiance and reprimand of the Central Government and the Congress comes from Narendra Modi only
 is baar ramdev apane andolan kaa suspence banaae hue hai
 Ramdev is not ready to tell anyone what will happen in Ramlila Maidan
 Will he go on hunger strike or satyagraha? Perhaps after learning the lesson from last time, Ramdev does not want to allow the government to get a glimpse of its strategy ahead of time

 There was a terrorist attack in Gurdaspur, Punjab
 pakistan se aae aatankwaadiyon ne pehle ek yatri bas par firing kii iske baad dinanagar thane par hamalaa kar diya
 13 people died in this quarrel which lasted for 11 hours
 iske saath hi desh ke khufia tantra par bhi sawaal uthne shuru ho gaye
 On Monday morning, terrorists tried to snatch a tempo after entering Dinanagar, but the tempo driver had realized his intent
 lihaaja wo tempo ko speed main bhaga kar le gaya
 But shortly afterwards a Maruti 800 car passed
 is baar aatankwaadiyon ne car dekhte hi usapar goliyaan barasaa di
 After injuring the people in the car, he was thrown out of the car
 car par kabja kar aatankwaadi dinanagar bas stand kii taraf bade
 But call it luck that as soon as the terrorist arrived in the bus stand riding in the car, the only bus to Jammu started running
 aatankwaadiyon ne bas ko jaataa dekh car main se hi usapar goliyaan barasaani shuru kar deen
 The bus driver understood everything as soon as he heard the gunshots
 usne fouran bas kii speed badha di or bas ko bhagaate hue le gaya
 If the terrorists had captured that bus, the lives of more than 75 passengers in the bus would have been in danger
 bas ko bhaagta dekh aatankwaadi lagaataar uskaa peechha karte hue pyring karte rahe
 However, within a short time, the bus got out of reach of the terrorists
 iske baad gusse main tamtamaae aatankvaadidinanagar police steshnapahunche
 It was morning, so there was not much movement in the police station
 subah kareeb saadhe chah baje aatankwaadi thane main firing karte hue ghuse
 The policemen sleeping in the compound inside the police station wake up after hearing the firing
 kuch duty par pehle se hi jaag rahe the
 Meanwhile, a policeman fired from a rifle and responded to the terrorists
 magar aatankwaadi ek-47 se lagaataar goliyaan barasaate hue thane main ghus aae
 Due to which seven policemen died on the spot
 jabaki jail ke lowep main band do kaidi bhi aatankwaadiyon kii goli kaa shikaar ho gaye
 Finally, after about 11 hours of effort, all the terrorists were killed around 5 pm
 iske baad thane kii talaashi lee gai to pataa chalaa ki puure dinanagar main subah se koharaam machaane vaale kul teen aatankwaadi the
 According to preliminary investigation, the three terrorists came from across the border
 khud khufia beuro ke mutabik unhone 24 july ko hi punjab sarkaar ko ye soochna de di thi ki rajya main aatankwaadi hamale ho sakate hai
 On this, the Chief Minister of Punjab says that if there was such information then the terrorists should have been stopped at the border itself
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne khulaasa kiya ki vitt mantri pranab mukherjee ke bare main jo baat logon ko nahin pataa he, vah yah he ki vah bahut adhik adhyayan karte hai or bengali mithaiyaan unki kamajori hai
 Offering the Karunakaran Award to Mukherjee, Singh said, 'what is not known is that Mukherjee studies a lot and loves history, art and culture and Bengali sweets are his weakness
 ’ singh ne mukherjee kii tarif karte hue kaha, raajnneeti main aaj aise gine chune hi vyakti hai jo janaseva kaa unke : (mukherjee) jaisaa lanbaa or ullekhneey ricard rakhte hon
 Describing Mukherjee as the equivalent of former Kerala Chief Minister k Karunakaran, he said, those who know him will be familiar with his extensive knowledge, amazing memory and hard work
 ’mukherjee ko apana sabase ‘moolyawaan sahyogi’ bataate hue pradhanmantri ne kaha, unka maananaa he ki samprag ke ‘safal prabandhan’ kaa shrey isaki adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke preranadayak netritv tathaa ‘sankatmochak mukherjee ke kaushal’ ko jaataa he
 He said, 'we have consulted deeply in all important decisions of the government
 sarkaar ke prabhavi tathaa sucharu sanchaalan main unhone jo bhi madad kii he, main uske liye nijee rup se unka abhaar karnaa chahta hum
 Singh said that Mukherjee's knowledge in parliamentary matters has no match
 unhone kaha, ‘unhen jo vyapak sammaan praapt he or sabhi dalon ke raajnneetik netritv se unka jo lanbaa sambandh rahaa he, vah sansadeey kaamkaaj ke sanchaalan main amuly sabit hua he
 'this first award has been conferred on Mukherjee
 is maukey par mukherjee ne kaha ki unhen bahut jald gussa aa jaataa he lekin iske baavjood pradhanmantri ne lagaataar unka samarthan kiya
 Mukherjee said, 'the Prime Minister gave his strong support in the last years, despite my early temper nature
 mere prati sabhi sahyogiyon ne jo sahishnutaa darshaayi he, main uske liye unka abhaari hum
 The Finance Minister said that he learned from Karunakaran how to handle two alliances
 
 
 ek bheetar kaa gathbandhan or doosraa baahar kaa gathbandhan
 He recalled his four-and-a-half-decade relationship with Karunakaran and said that he had mastered the art of 'carrying people of different ideologies together
 ’ mukherjee ko ‘di best administrate in india award 2011’ se sammanit kiya gaya he
 Under this award, he has been awarded a citation, a memento and a cash amount of Rs one lakh

 India has once again given a stern warning to China, who is at the border
 china main bhartiya rajdoot gautam bambaawale ne sakht lahaze main kaha ki agar china ne seemaa par yathasthiti main badlaav karne kii koshish kii, to doklam vivaad jaise halaat paidaa ho jaaenge
 He said that China should learn from the Doklam dispute and should not attempt any change in the status quo on the border
 hongcong daure ke samay chini akhbaar south china morning post ko die saakshaatkaar main bambaawale ne kaha ki bharat or china ke bich seemaa nirdhaarit nahin hai, jo ek gambhir samasya he
 Bambawale said that both countries should take quick steps to set the border, so that peace and stability can be established on the border
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki seemaa par shanti or behatar talmail banaae rakhane ke liye donon deshon ke bich khulkar or spasht baatcheet honi chahie
 This statement of Gautam Bambawale came out ahead of PM Modi's visit to China in June
 bharat-china kii senaayen khulkar karen baatcheetbhartiya rajdoot ne kaha ki piem modi or chini raashtrapati ke bich ucch str par acchhee baatcheet he, lekin nichle str par bhi baatcheet honi chahie
 The armies of the two countries should openly negotiate at the border, as this will help reduce tensions between the two countries
 doklam vivaad ke baad se ab tak donon deshon ke sainya mukhyalay ke bich baatcheet nahin shuru ho pai he
 The stalemate was caused by the change in status quo in Doklam, he said, adding that there was no open and clear dialogue between the two countries as a result of the standoff in Doklam and the armies of the two countries came face to face
 bhartiya rajdoot ne kaha ki chini sena nedoklamame yathasthiti main badlaav kiya tha, jiske baad bharat ne is par apni pratikriya di thi
 India responded only because the Chinese military changed the status quo on the border
 agar yathasthiti main badlaav hua, to phir doklam jaise honge halatpichley saal doklam main gatirodh hone kaa kaaran yah tha ki donon desh ek-duusare ke saath khulkar spasht baatcheet nahin kar rahe the
 It is to be known that last year the armies of both the countries came face to face in Doklam
 donon deshon ke bich yah gatirodh 73 dinon tak chalaa tha
 Bambawale said that there are certain areas on the india-china border, which are extremely sensitive
 in kshetron main yathasthiti main badlaav nahin hona chahie
 If someone makes a change, it will create a situation similar to the Doklam standoff
 bhartiya rajdoot ne kaha ki agar seemaa parchinsadak banane ja rahaa he, to usko bharat ko isaki jaankaree deni chahie
 If India does not agree to this, it will immediately reply that you are changing the status quo
 aap aisa na kariye
 This is a very sensitive area

 desh ke vibhinn shaharon main pyaaj ke daam achaanak kuch din main hi badhkar 70 rupee prati kilogram par pahunch gaye hai
 Onion prices have increased, possibly due to supply shortage

 vahiin vitt mantri pranav mukherjee ne kaha ki vah isaki aapurti main sudhaar ke liye sambhddha mantralayon se baat karenge, jisase upabhoktaaon ko raahat mil sake
 The Finance Minister said that it is very unfortunate that onion prices have reached such a high
 ab mandiyon se upabhoktaaon tak aapurti main bhi kai khamiyaan hai
 It is necessary to remove this bottleneck
 iske liye main sambhddha mantralayon se baat karuunga
 Company Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid said that the government cannot control prices in every store
 jab bhi kuch hota he, to sarkaar har dukaan ko sensor nahin kar sakati he
 Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma had said that the rise in onion prices was due to hoarding
 unhone kaha ki jamkhori kii vajah se pyaaj ke daam bade hai
 There are enough onion reserves in the country
 adhikariyon ne kaha ki pyaaj kii keemton main thodi teji maharashtra main fasal barbaad hone kii vajah se jarur ai he par is vajah se pyaaj ke daamon main sirf 15 se 20 pratishat kii vruddhi honi chahie

 supreme court ne aaj bisisiai adhyaksh pad ke taur par en shrinivasana kii jagah sunil gavskar ke naam kaa prastaav diya he or is mahaan ballebaaj ne kaha ki vah desh kii sheersh adaalat ke nirdeshon kaa paalan karke ‘khush’ or ‘sammanit’ honge
 At the same time, sources are quoting that BCCI will oppose Sunil Gavaskar as interim president
 sutron kaa kahana he ki bisisiai court main daleel degi ki bisisiai ke apane niyam va kanoon hai or vah kisi bahari ko is tarah pad par asin nahin kar sakati
 Gavaskar said, "first thing is if the top court makes some suggestions then you should do it, but it should be on record
" is samay meraa bisisiai se camentator ke taur par anubandh he, lekin agar supreme court chahta he to main aisa karuunga
 He told 'NDTV', when the Supreme Court tells you, there is no question about it, you cannot do anything about it and whatever they ask me to do, i will be happy to do it
 purv bhartiya captain gavaskar ne kaha ki vah adaalat ke antim aadesh kaa intjaar karenge
 He said, i will consider it, it is a great honor that the Supreme Court believes that i will be fine for this post
 lekin hamen kal tak intjaar karnaa hoga ki aadesh kya hota he
 We should not reach a straight decision
 yah poochne par ki kya vah chunauti ke liye taiyaar hai to gavaskar ne kaha, bataur salaami ballebaaj aapako har tarah kii chunauti ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie, aapako har tarah kii pichon par khelnaa hota he, aap maansik or shaareerik rup se chunauti ke liye hameshaa taiyaar rahete ho
 He said, even today i am happy to stay away from the pleasantries, but if the Supreme Court wants me to do something, then i am ready according to the need

 While giving seven talks to the newspaper Mumbai Mirror, Sreesanth says that next year's tour of India to South Africa is my target
 mujhe ummid he ki main senior fast bowler kii haisiyat se team india ke saath south africa jane vaali flite main jarur baithunga
 i have done well in South Africa before and will do so
 saath hi srisanth kaa maananaa he ki vah abhi 3-4 saal or cricket khel sakate hai or saal 2019 main hone vaale worldcup main khelnaa unka sapana he or use vah har haal main puraa karnaa chaahate hai
 Let me tell you that after the Kerala High Court's decision to lift the ban on Sreesanth recently, the board has not yet clarified whether it will allow Sreesanth to play back
 board ke adhikariyon ke mutabik abhi is faisle kaa baariki se vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Significantly, during the 2013 IPL, Sreesanth and his two other Rajasthan Royals partners Ajit Chandela and Ankit Chauhan were arrested by the Delhi Police after they were accused of spot-fixing
 bisisiai ne iske baad unhen suspend kar diya tha
 After this, he had moved the Kerala High Court due to not getting relief from the BCCI even after being acquitted by the Delhi court and got relief there

 Home Secretary ke

 Apart from these, requests are also coming from the state agencies which need the permission of the Ministry of Home Affairs for phone tapping in Union Territories

 As a remedy, the surveillance department is bound to be strengthened due to the increasing reliance on phone tapping

 But in every legal case hundreds of illegal wiretaps are executed

 The conversation was leaked from the city's crime branch
 chaar privet jasuson ko 2005 main sapa netaa amar singh ke phone record gaiyr-kanoonee rup se hasil karne ke liye dharaa gaya tha
 But what if illegally tapped conversations become evidence of wrongdoing? Officials say the previous date application is sought from the Home Secretary
 prayek agency ko phone ko nigaraanee main lene se pehle praadhikaar slip bharani hoti he
 In the states, the home secretary of the state signs these

 Prior to the advent of cellular phones, state agencies used to take parallel lines from telephone poles, make arrangements to live around it or they would live in tents like nomads

 Today, each company providing cellular service has an aggregation station that connects servers
 ise mediation sarvars kaha jaataa he kyonki ye cellular oparator or kanoon pravartan agenciyon ke bich madhyasthata karte hai
 Phones are tapped through them

 Police can listen to the phone on the PRI line and store the recording in a computer attached to it
 saath hi saath, pakadi gai kol kii sound file bhi record ho jaati he or mediation sarwar par store ho jaati he
 In ISDN, data related to calls is not transferred in real time
 64 kebipies kii dhimi gati ke kaaran 2 -3 minute lag hi jate hai
 The data packet is lost in traffic and the call does not reach the PRI line

 In the h line, the service provider provides the agency access to its main network through a fast-speed fiber optic cable connection

 Common methods of monitoring include giving the person a call's data record (CDR) or list of dialed or received numbers

 sutara bataate hai ki iskar vibhaag or sibiai jesudasana ke phone tap karnaa chaahate the lekin swaabhaavik kaarnon se iske khilaaf faisla kiya
 There is a catch in this story
 sangathit aparaadh or aatankwaad par najar rakhane ke liye badi sankhya main nigaraanee upkaran kharide gaye lekin khufia agencia pachhataa rahi hai ki phone tanping or sandesh sunne ke kuch khaas nattejey haath nahin aa rahe kyonki aatankwaadiyon ne teji se blueberi phonon kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar diya he jabaki unke aakaa nai peedi ke inmarsat-4 satellite phone kaam main le rahe hai
 This makes it impossible to listen to their phones in the moment
 inmarsat-4 phonon ko haalanki pakadaa ja saktaa he lekin yah baatcheet code formet main hi milegi
 Voice and data can be effectively monitored at the INMARSAT-4 switches in London and New York
 vahaan yah bina code vaale swaroop main uplabdh he
 This is the reason why India still depends on British and American intelligence agencies for information

 Free software that encrypts calls and mail can be downloaded on modern handsets and computers
 baatcheet or sandeshon ko surakshit rakhane ke liye vanijyik rup se uplabdh selcript jaise software sabase kargar paae gaye hai
 cellcrypt, which fits all smartphones, encodes all kinds of conversations on a private level
 puri tarah se surakshit vaarta ke liye donon taraf ke handset main yah software laga hona chahie
 If it is installed in a single handset, then the conversation at the other end will be available in an encrypted format

 '' isse desh bhar main tap kiye ja rahe phonon kaa aankada bhi uplabdh hoga
 With this monitoring system, small towns and cities of the state will be able to connect with the capital and all the state capitals will be connected to the central monitoring unit in Delhi through fiber optic cables
 ibi dilli main baithe-baithe kahin ke kisi phone kii nigaraanee kar saktaa he
 Due to its connection to the local switchboard, this Delhi center can make the tapping process even easier for the states
 adhikari ke shabdon main, ''isse sarvice hdhowider kii jimmedaari bhi bad jaaegi kyonki vah sambandhit baatcheet muhaiyaa karaane ko majaboor hoga
 Under this, for the first time the government will be allowed to monitor the cellphone of a suspect on various networks, that too across the country
 ek khufia adhikari to ise phone tanping software kaa ''atomi hathiyaar'' qaraar dete hai
 This is why the government plans to continue with the Mandatory Audit Trail file, which will also have electronic footprints of the numbers to be tapped — how long has the agency been allowed tapping, the conversation recorded? And did it become copies? Et cetera
 duniya bhar main yahi protocol lagu he
 It is necessary to present an audit file in the courts of countries that recognize the phone tap as evidence
 is pariyojna se jude ek khufia afasar ke mutabik, ''bharat main hdhotocol ke tahat tap kii anadhikrut rup se koi prati nahin banaai ja sakati
 The entire system is transparent
 '' audit file tak ek khaas password ke jariye hi pahunchaa ja saktaa he, jo kendriya agenciyon ke paas hi hoga
 In an attempt to tally all tapped information-analysis, the Ministry of Home Affairs has asked the states for all the records they have captured on phone and internet

 The head of such a Central Committee is the Cabinet Secretary and the Law and Telecommunications Secretary is its member

 It rarely raises any questions over phone or internet surveillance
 rajyon main in samitiyon kaa kriyanvayan bahut sust he
 Just imagine this scene
 mumbai ke malad main baitha k naam kaa koi aatankwaadi kolaba main aatankwaadi kha or banda main ga ko esemes bhejtaa he
 He asks the two to meet at Ju Beach at six in the evening
 kha or ga ke nikal padane kii vajah se unke cellphone lokation ke jariye unhen talash paanaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 The police make changes to A's SMS and send it to b by writing that "meet at Kalaghoda at 5 o'clock" and write to c that "meet at Regal Cinema at 6 o'clock
" '' esemes par bharosa karte 'e kha or ga vaisaa hi karte hai
 The police nab the three with great care
 zyaadaatar aatankwaad nirodhak agenciyaan is tarah ke oparation ko anjaam de sakati hai
 This tactic of off-air tapping makes the police virtually a cellphone tower-like tool
 vah esemes or kol ko idhar yaa udhar yaa phir jam bhi kar sakati he
 The machine can also chase a target in urban areas by placing it on a vehicle, where traditional surveillance tricks fail to chase the moving suspect
 suraksha agenciyon kaa kahana he ki is technology ke istemaal par niyantran ke liye unke paas paryaapt vibhageeya niyam-kanoon hai
 For example, the crime branch in Mumbai needs written permission from the Commissioner of Police to use this machine
 phir bhi siyaasi khufiagiri or nijee phaaydon ke liye iske durupyog ke andeshe ko khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Keeping this possibility in mind, the Uttar Pradesh anti-terrorism Squad recently refused to take this tool

 vahiin congress ko itihaas main sabase kam 106 siten milane kii sambhaavna jataai gai he or sahyogiyon ke saath vah 129 siton ke aankade tak pahunch sakati he
 The special thing of this opinion poll is that the opinion of two lakh people has been asked in it
 isamen siton kii sankhya kii bhavishyavaanee kii gai he, na ki siton kii range ke bare main anumaan lagaaya gaya he
 If the prediction of this poll turns out to be true, it will be the best ever performance by the BJP
 endie 229 seat paakar sabase bade chunaav purv gathbandhan ke rup main ubhar saktaa he
 According to tradition, the President has been inviting the largest party or the largest pre-election alliance to form the government
 aise main endie ko tarzih di ja sakati he, lekin bahumat ke aankade se endie ke 43 siten dur rahane kii sambhaavna is surveykshan main bataai gai he
 In such a situation, the President can ask questions about the stability of the government
 is surveykshan kaa ek or dilachasp nishkarsh he
 The gap of 100 seats in NDA and UPA
 isi tarah bijepi or congress main kareeb 90 siton kaa antar bataaya gaya he
 This difference is significant because the Congress getting around 100 seats will mean the end of the possibility of a third front or alternative front government through support from outside the Congress
 sawaal yah uthta he ki agar surveykshan sahi sabit hota he, to endie sarkaar banane ke liye jaruri 40 siton kii vyavastha kaise karegaa? bijepi ke ranneetikaar vaise bhi endie ke bahumat se dur rahane par sambhavit sahyogiyon ke rup main aise dalon ko saath lenaa pasand karenge, jo sarkaar main shaamil hokar use sthayitv de saken
 Considering past experiences, the BJP would not be keen on seeking support from Jayalalithaa's AIADMK and Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress, as both of these leaders posed many difficulties for Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government
 haalanki jayalalita ke saath narendra modi kii mitrataa he
 Jayalalithaa, after initially standing with the Third Front, has hinted to the BJP for a possible post-election alliance by breaking ties with her side
 jabaki mamata banerjee or jayalalita donon ke bich barf pighali he or baatcheet kaa silsilaa shuru hua he
 Mamta Banerjee has to go to the assembly elections in West Bengal
 muslim matadaataaon ko dhyaan main rakhkar vah shaayad hi sarkaar main shaamil hon
 Yes, by giving strategic support to the government from outside, it can definitely charge a 'hefty price' for the state
 sambhavit sahyogiyon ke liye yah ek bada factor hoga
 The regional parties running the governments in the states want to have a friendly attitude from the central government

 Naveen Patnaik could be one such potential collaborator in Odisha
 gaiyrcongresavad ke naam par bijepi patnayak ko saath laa sakati he
 On the other hand, governments formed in both Seemandhra and Telangana states after the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh also need the help of the central government for development

 Both can be potential allies of BJP
 jaahir he ye baaten isi aadhaar par likhi gai hai ki janamat surveykshan main kii gai bhavishyavaanee sach sabit ho

 lekin janamat surveykshan ke akalan ko agar hawa kaa ishaara bhi maane, to yah andaja lagaana galat nahin hoga ki hawa endie ke paksh main bah rahi he
 Therefore, it is no surprise that the regional parties, already sensing the wind, have started preparing for the post-election prospects

 ) loksabhaa chunaav 2019 se pehle bijepi ke khilaaf jammu-kashmir main mahagathbandhan banane kii kavayad shuru hui thi
 But before being implemented, the Governor recommended the dissolution of the assembly and threw out these efforts
 bataa den ki jammu-kashmir main bijepi or pidipi ke bich gathbandhan tuutane ke baad se rajyapal shashan laga tha
 The Congress, National Conference and PDP were continuously raising demands for dissolution of the assembly, but were not ready for the election
 jabaki bijepi pipuls conference adhyaksh sajaad gani lone ke netritv main tisare morche kii sarkaar banane kii kavayad main thi, lekin bahumat kaa aankade ke liye unhen 18 anya vidhayakon kii jarurat thi
 In such a situation, it was not possible without a break in the opposition's party
 bijepi ne kya khoyajammu-kashmir kii siyasat main bijepi pehali baar 2015 main 25 vidhayak jeetne main safal rahi thi
 It was the second largest party after PDP
 aise main bijepi-pidipi gathbandhan kii sarkaar bani thi
 But the government could only run for 40 months between the two
 donon partiyon ke bich sarkaar main rahete hue bhi behatar talmail nahin dikhe
 At the same time, BJP could not remain in state power for five years even after winning 25 seats
 party ke kai vidhayak pehali baar chunaav jite the, lekin ve bataur vidhayak 6 saal kaa kaarykaal puraa nahin kar paae
 What benefits BJP, bjp's rival opponents National Conference and PDP and Congress got together in the exercise of forming a government, as the BJP tried to form a Third Front Government
 lekin inaki sarkaar banati isse pehle rajyapal ne vidhansabha ko bhang kar diya
 In this way, the opposition could not form a government together
 agar aisa hota to yah gathbandhan 2019 ke aam chunaav main bhi badi takat ban saktaa tha
 What is the loss of PDP? The PDP emerged as the largest party in Jammu and Kashmir with 28 seats, but due to being away from the majority figure, it had to form a government with the BJP
 lekin 40 maheene ke uthapatak ke baad gathbandhan se alag hona padaa
 Six mlas and one MP rebelled from the party after being out of power
 kisi bhi tut se bachane or satta main vaapasi ke liye pidipi neshnal conference or congress ke saath milakar sarkaar banane kii kavayad kar rahi thi, lekin rajyapal ne is mansoobey par pani pher diya
 However, the PDP succeeded in protecting itself from breakage
 neshnal conference ne kya khoyaa-kya payanational conference ke paas 15 vidhayak the
 Party chief Omar Abdullah was consistently recommending dissolution of the assembly, but was not ready for the election
 agar tisare morche kii sarkaar vajood main aati to neshnal conference ke vidhayak bhi tut sakate the
 In such a situation, due to dissolution of the assembly, the party survived the breakdown of the mlas, but the party suffered the loss that the Grand Alliance government could not be formed
 congress ne kya nuksaan-kya phaaydajammu-kashmir main congress ke paas 12 vidhayak the
 The Congress was not in a position to form a government
 haalanki vidhayakon ke tuutane kaa khatra party par lagaataar bana hua tha
 Due to dissolution of the assembly, the Congress suffered that the Grand Alliance could not exist in the state before the 2019 elections
 haalanki, pidipi kii tarah congress apane vidhayakon ko tuutane se bachaa le gai

 But the problem of the Ghaziabad police was that whom should we interrogate
 kyonki maukey par dikhaae gaye sabhi ke sabhi das aaropee dilli or faridabad ke alag alag thanon main kaid the
 Murder of the day in hazing, and then back to jail, how can the same person exist in two different places at the same time
 ji haa jo pehle se hi dilli or faridabad ke thanon main band ho wo ghaziabad main maukey par pahunch kar itane sansanikhez hatya cond ko kaise anjama de saktaa he
 Is it not so that a few of the uniformed men met these murderers in Delhi and allowed them to go to hawala-e-kadat by hawala to carry out this double murder
 ab tak to aapane aisi kahani sirf filmon main dekhi hogi
 But is it really possible? kya koi din dahaade hawalat se chhot kar hatya kare or phir waapas hawalat main aa jaae

 paanch may ko vishwa paryaavaran diwas he or iske thik pehle centre for science and invayrnment ne apana ek survey release kiya he
 In this survey, it has been found that the country's steel companies are causing a huge amount of pollution
 isamen solid west ke alaava baari maatra main hawa or pani kaa pradooshan shaamil he
 In a survey conducted on 21 steel companies of the country, CSE found that all these companies are not producing them according to the scale on which they use land, water, electricity and raw materials
 masalan desh ke tamaam steel plants ke paas 75 hazaar hectare zamin he jabaki inkaa utpaadan mahaz 75 million ton he
 Whereas according to international standard, to produce 1 million or one million tonnes of steel, only 200 hectares of land is required
 siesai kii maane to 21 main 13 companiyon ne hi survey main sahyog kiya jabaki sarkari company cell ke rourkela plant ke alaava koi or plant is survey ke liye taiyaar hi nahin hua
 Government company SAIL tops the polluting companies
 siesai ke mutabik cell ke sirf rourkela plant ne hi is survey main hissaa liya jabaki bhilai, durgapur, bokaro or burnpur plants ne survey ke liye apni taraf se koi jaankaree nahin di
 Nevertheless, based on the data collected by CSE in its own way, it was found that sail's plants are causing the most damage to the environment
 tippaniyan Surprisingly, SAIL has got only 2 to 9 marks on the standard of environmental protection to these plants
 siesai kii mahanideshak sunita narayan kaa kahana he ki cell ke paas bahut suvidhaayen hai jinase vah acha bandobast kar sakate the
 The government will have to think why this Maharatna company is not doing anything for the sake of the environment
 survey main maharashtra ke raigarh kii ispaat industry ko sabase acha mana gaya he lekin yah bhi 40 fisadi number hi hasil kar paayi
 The CSE claims that it took two years to reach the results and that every plant from the mine to the environmental management was tested at around 150 scales
 apane survey or uske nattejey kii vishwasaneeyata ke bare main sunita narayan kahati hai ki survey main companiyon se mili jaankaree or aankadon ko pradooshan control board se mili aankadon ke saath mila kar dekha gaya
 Apart from this, he was also examined on occasion and he also spoke to the surrounding population
 nateeja jari karne ke pehle ise sambandhit plants ko bhi bheja gaya
 Some plants tried to make their point while some refused to accept it
 ab in nateezon ke zarie siesai sarkaar par yah dabaav banane kii koshish karegi ki vah steel plants ke liye kade qaayade kanoon banaae taaki paryaavaran ko hone vaale nuksaan ko kam kiya ja sake
 According to CSE, only 21 companies supported the survey in 21 while none other than the Rourkela plant of state-run SAIL was ready for this survey
 pradooshan failaane vaali companiyon main sarkari company cell sabase upar he
 According to CSE, only Rourkela plants of SAIL participated in this survey, while Bhilai, Durgapur, Bokaro and Burnpur plants did not provide any information for their survey
 phir bhi siesai ne apane tareeqe se jo aankade jutaaye unke aadhaar par yah paaya gaya ki cell ke plants paryaavaran ko sabase zyada nuksaan pahunchaa rahe hai
 The comments hairat kii baat he cell ko in plants ko paryaavaran sangrakshan ke maanak par mahaz 2 se 9 ank tak mili hai
 CSE Director General Sunita Narayan says that SAIL has a lot of facilities with which it could manage well
 sarkaar ko sochna hoga ki akhir ye maharatna company paryaavaran kii khaatir kuch kyon nahin kar rahi
 In the survey, the steel industry of Raigad in Maharashtra has been considered the best but it has achieved only 40 percent number
 siesai kaa daawa he ki nattejey tak pahunchane main do saal lage or har plant ke khadaan se lekar invaranmental management tak qareeb 150 paimaanon par jaanch kii gai
 Regarding the reliability of its survey and its results, Sunita Narayan says that the information and data from the companies in the survey was combined with data from the Pollution Control Board
 iske alaava mauqe par ja kar bhi jaanch kii gai or aasapaas kii aabaadi se bhi baat kii gai
 Before releasing the result, it was also sent to the respective plants
 ekaadh plants ne apni baat rakhane kii koshish kii jabaki kuch ne ise maanane se inkaar kar diya
 Now through these results, CSE will try to pressurize the government to enact stringent laws for steel plants so that the damage to the environment can be minimized

 India need to be very cautious in the Test match against England from July 21 at Lord's
 yah 2000waan test match hoga or yadi ab tak ke aankadon par gaur kiya jaae to pehle se lekar 100, 200, 1000 yani lagbhag har sauven test match main mejabaan team kaa dabadabaa rahaa he
 India is the number one Test team in the world right now, but England have also done well in the last two years in the long-term format
 bharat ke liye vahaan kii tej or swing leti pichon par uske tej gendbaajon kaa saamana karnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Apart from this, the figures are also against India, being the 2000th Test
 ab tak yadi pehle, 100wein, 200wein or isi tarah se aage ke har sauven test match ke parinaam par gaur kiya jaae, to mejabaan team adhiktar match main jeet darj karne main safal rahi he
 It also includes the first Test match, so far 14 of 20 such matches have resulted, out of which 10 hosts have won the match
 bharat ko yadi is myth ko todna he, to use australia yaa westeindies jaisaa pradarshan karnaa hoga
 Australia won one such Test match against the West Indies on three occasions
 bharat ke liye acchhee khabar yah he ki in chaaron avasaron par haarane vaali mejabaan team england kii thi
 The first Test match played in Melbourne was won by hosts Australia by 45 runs
 iske baad 100waan test match sidney main khelaa gaya, jisamen phir se australia jeetne main safal rahaa
 England hosted the 300th Test match in 1948, but the guest Australia then won
 bharat or pakistan ke bich karachi main 1955 main khelaa gaya shrunkhlaa kaa paanchvaan match 400waan test tha
 The match ended inconclusive
 iske alaava bharat or dakshin africa ke bich durban main 1992 main khele gaye test sankhya 1200wein kaa parinaam bhi nahin nikal paaya tha
 Australia also defeated their arch-rivals England in their 600th and 800th Test matches at their home
 westeindies ne is tarah ke maichon main england ko uski dharti par haraane ke alaava 1981 main carabian sarazmi (brijtoun) par khelaa gaya 900waan test match bhi jeeta tha
 The 1984 match played between Pakistan and New Zealand in Hyderabad was the 1000th Test
 isamen mejabaan pakistan ne saat wicket se jeet darj kii thi
 Between these two teams, the 1600th Test match was played in Lahore in 2002, in which Pakistan won by an innings and 324 runs
 england ko is tarah ke maichon main adhiktar haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa, lekin lords main 2004 main khele gayi 1700wein match main vah pehali baar har 100wein test se jude myth ko todane main safal rahaa
 It was the first Test match of England's current captain Andrew Strauss

 An employee of the National Security Research Organization (NTRO), the country's premier security organization, noticed some strange 'signals' on his monitoring system

 magar bina koi spashtikaran die is chetavanee ko ansuna kar diya gaya or is galati kaa nateeja bharat ke khilaaf ab tak ke sabase bade sibar atake ke rup main saamne aayaa
 Several high-level officials reported on July 12, 2012 that their emails had been hacked
 inamen videsh mantralay, grih mantralay, raksha anusandhan evam vikaas sanghathan (diardio) or bharat-tibet seemaa police (itibipi, yah ardhsainik bal china ke saath lagi 3,500 kilometre lambii seemaa par tainaat he) ke adhikari shaamil the
 Hackers entered the main email server of the National Informatics Center
 jaanch se pataa chalaa ki lagbhag 12,000 email khate hack hue
 The severity of this attack seems to suggest that the hackers wanted to steal important information
 unki khaas najar suraksha jaankariyon par thi
 "ministries like Panchayati Raj, Women and Child Development and Statistics have not been touched," says a senior NTRO official on condition of anonymity
 haikaron kaa sara dhyaan sicrates par tha
 They stole secret information such as places of deployment of troops and communication between ITBP (commanders) and Home Ministry officials
 ” adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki videsh mantralay, grih mantralay or diardio kii gupt soochnaaon ke peeche to koi bhi desh ho saktaa he, lekin itibipi main sirf ek desh kii dilchaspee ho sakati he—china, jiske saath bharat kaa lambey samay se seemaa vivaad he

 jaanchakarta bataate hai ki zyaadaatar computaron main apadated security software ke nahin hone se sthiti zyada bigadi
 Till recently, the responsibility of keeping the country safe from cyber attacks was on the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (cert-in), formed in 2004 under the Department of Information Technology
 tab se sibar security se judi jin ghatnaon kii jaankaree mil saki, unki sankhya 23 se badhkar 2011 main 13,301 par pahunch gai
 Experts believe that the actual number of these attacks can be 10 times more, because most of their victims either do not know it or do not believe that their system has been hacked
 pichley saal july main sarkaar ne siiarti-inaki jimmedaariyon ko do hisson main baant diya, jisase gambhir khatre maamuli muddon kii bheed main kho na jaaen

 In his clarification, Mallya has consistently put his side to each of the charges against him
 bainkon kaa kitna karj?maalya ne bataaya ki state bank of india ke netritv main 17 bainkon ke sangh ne kingfisher airlines ko kareeb 5,500 karod rupee kaa lone diya tha
 As per the rules, they were approved at every level of the bank to give this loan
 iske baad lone ke liye girvee rakhi gai sampatti ko bechate hue 600 karod rupee kii recovery kii ja chuki he
 Apart from this, since 2013, Rs 1,280 crore has been lying in the security deposit in the Karnataka High Court
 lihaaja kul milakar 1,880 karod rupee kii recovery kii ja chuki he
 Mallya claimed that during 2010, when the aviation sector in the country was in a slack phase, with the approval of the Reserve Bank, steps were taken to restructure the loan given to Kingfisher
 iske baad khud state bank of india ne janvari 2012 main arabiai ko likhaa ki maalya ne paryaapt maatra main kingfisher airlines main nivesh kiya he lekin maujuuda susti ke chalate airlines ko ghate se jane main rokna sambhav nahin he
 Read this: Vijay Mallya will be declared a fugitive under the new law, the property will be confiscated
 After this, when the Kingfisher Airlines went into loss, the consortium of lending banks approached the tribunal for recovery of the loan and a loan of Rs 5000 crore and Rs 1200 crore
 Demanded recovery of interest of Rs
 lihaaja, bainkon kii taraf se kul 6,200 karod rupee kii recovery kii baat kahi gai lekin media main atishyokti ke saath dendaree kii report kaa prasar kiya gaya
 The allegation of willful default? Mallya claimed that after the banks went to the tribunal, the Supreme Court made two proposals of settlement
 yah prastaav 29 march 2016 or 6 april 2016 ko die gaye
 In these proposals, the bank offered Rs 4,000 crore in lieu of loan of Rs 5,000 crore and Rs 2,000 crore in another pending case
 is prastaav ko agle maheene 4,400 karod or 2,000 karod rupee ke sanshodhan ke saath pesh kiya gaya
 But while the first proposal was turned down at the top level of the bank, the second proposal was turned down in the Supreme Court by a small employee of the bank
 vijay maalya ne daawa kiya ki in prastaavon ko thukraae jane ke baad unhone 10 may 2016, 2 june 2016 or 10 june 2016 ko esbiai pramukh ko patr likhte hue samjhaute par charchaa karne ke liye kaha
 Therefore, Mallya claims that in such a situation, it is not appropriate for banks to declare him a willful defaulter as he has taken the initiative to settle the debts of the banks continuously
