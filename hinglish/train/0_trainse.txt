 The matter of leaking of question papers in the SSC examination throughout March was raised with great noise, because the students gathered in large numbers outside the Staff Selection Commission office for several days
 congress, bijepi or swaraj india ke netaa inke bich aate jate rahe
 On 6 March, Home Minister Rajnath Singh also ordered a CBI inquiry
 chaatro kii maang thi ki is saal 17 farvari se 22 farvari ke bich jo parikshaayen hui thim, unamem bade paimaane par prashn patr li hue hai
 The students were waiting for the report of the inquiry when the news came that the staff selection commission chairman Aseem Khurana's tenure has been extended by one year
 donon main koi sambandh nahin he basharte prashn patron ke li hone kii jaanch ho jaati
 However, there is anger among the students about this
 swaraj india ke anupam ne bayaan jari kar khurana ke kaarykaal badaye jane kii aalochana kii he
 In the first phase of the job series, we had shown that students who passed the CHSL 2015 and CGL 2016 exams are not getting the joining letter even after passing
 series ke baad kai hazaar chaatro ko jwining letters mila he? pichley hafte se sieji main assistant audit afasar ke pad par 1000 chaatro kii jwining ho rahi he
 As soon as we join, send us a message of thanks
 kaash sabake saath aisa ho jaataa
 Why many students of CHSL 2015 still have not received the joining letter
 inkaa kahana he ki kai vibhaagon ne niyukti patr to de die, chaatro ne jwine bhi kar liya magar abhi bhi kuch vibhaag aise hai jo niyukti patr nahin de rahe hai
 Address on the phone says that the appointment will be in july-august
 bataaiye agast 2017 main rigelt aayaa or ek saal lagegaa niyukti hone main
 With this, now those students are upset who have given the CGL 2016 exam, the result has come but the appointment letter is not being received
 ham jis pariksha kii baat kar rahe hai uskaa notification oktober 2016 main niklaa tha
 Advertisement was issued for 6708 posts

 The exam goes on for two years

 Some students have sent audio recordings

 Some banks have ordered to construct toilets for women bankers
 ab itnaa vakt to ho hi chukaa he ki shauchalay ban janaa chahie
 The basic demand of bankers is also salary due to working conditions, stresses, so we wanted to look into them through these things, so we do not care about our holiday in the transfer of women bankers, apart from cross selling
 Doing it, whether it is a female or a male banker, not getting discharged if they fall ill or the family members get sick, all these things are also important
 hamane yah bhi dekha ki is bich kuch bankeron par hamale bhi hue
 There were also reports of suicide
 banking duniya ke bheetar kaaphi kuch acha nahin he
 On 21 May, Alok Chander, who was posted as manager at the Bank of Baroda in Arwal, Bihar, was shot dead

 At the age of 71, he also has amazing energy and has a long queue of films
 bollywood shabd unhen jamata nahin
 Bollywood superstars, often out of the reach of the media, were seen promoting on every platform from television to Bhootnath Returns
 unhone maan liya he ki marketing aaj filmon kaa ahm hissaa ban chuki he
 Even today, he is reputed to play the role of angry young man
 vidhu vinod chopra kii agali film main shatranj ke khilaadi kaa kirdaar nibhaane ja rahe hai
 Excerpts from Assistant Editor Narendra Saini's conversation with Amitabh Bachchan about elections, film and Hindi cinema: You are also looking fiercely on TV for film promotion, any special reason? Marketing has become an essential tool
 televijan madhyam bad gaye hai
 Earlier there used to be a government channel
 usee ko ham dekhte the
 There are now 500–600 channels
 pehle filmein 25, 50 or 75 hafte chalati thim
 People had time and they used to visit again and again
 ab ghar baithe tivi yaa utyub par kuch bhi dekh sakate hai
 This reduced the lifespan of the film and now the business takes place in a week or two
 pehle yaa duusare hafte kii kamai ko prabalata dene ke liye, log chaahate hai ki film kaa jabardast pramotion ho
 That's why
 ye experience aapako kaisaa laga?pehle to hamako ajeeb lagata tha kyonki ham puraane jamaane ke hai
 But i believe that it should go with the times
 aap antarrashtriya str par hindi cinema ko kis tarah dekhte hai?bhartiya cinema kaa apana mahatv or ruparekha he
 Despite this, our films are criticized in western countries
 phir bhi hamane apane aapako badla nahin he
 i am glad of it
 1970-80 ke dashak main jab ham videsh jate the to hamaari filmon ko lekar pashchim ke log kataaksh karte the
 There are songs
 
 
 hamaara jo vaataavaran he desh kaa or jis vajah se filmein banati hai or jis tarah ke log inhen dekhne jate hai, unke liye ye filmein paryaapt hai
 They do not understand this because they do not have such an environment
 acchhee baat yah he ki aaj itane saal ke baad, pashchimi desh bhi hamaare cinema ko maanane lage hai
 The thing for which we were seen in a wrong way is the population
 ab vahi euaspy ban rahi he
 If we see one and a half crore programs outside, we understand that it has been saved
 yahaan itnaa to aadhi mumbai main puraa ho jaataa he
 They cannot imagine 25 crore people watch a program
 unke liye aarthik mauka he
 Economics is visible because of population
 bade studio bharat aa rahe hai
 Even after spending 45 years in films, there is some difficulty in front of the camera? kaam kabhi bhi aasaan nahin hota
 As time changes, we have to walk accordingly
 aisa maan lenaa ki hamaare liye koi kaam aasaan he, galat he
 i believe that i never get into a situation where i feel that this work is easy for me
 chunavi maahaul he
 Star is coming into politics or campaigning
 kya aapako is tarah ke ofer nahin mili?nahin sahab, maine to raajnneeti chhod di he
 
 
 a friend has said? They know that we do not do politics
 jab se chodi he hamane rajnatik kaary nahin kiya he
 Nor have we said anything by going to any political platform
 bataur kalakaar koi aisa kirdaar he jo aap nibhaana chaahate hon?main ummid karata hum ki is tarah kaa role ho
 i wish i got work, that's all
 kaam miltaa rahata he to thik rahata he
 But the directors will have to think
 unako dhundhna padegaa
 If they get a role, then i have to see if it is challenging or not
 role chunate samay aap kis baat kaa dhyaan rakhte hai?kahani
 My character koun iskaa nirdesan kar rahaa he
 producer
 puri tarah film ban paaegi yaa nahin
 Whether it will be made well or not
 banane ke baad prachaar or distribution kaisaa hoga
 Many things come to mind
 bahut-se log isse anbhigya hai
 i do not know too much about business
 is maamle main nai peedi kahaan he?aajkal kii peedi ke jitne kalakaar hai, unhen bahut gyaan he
 Many are producers themselves
 ve apni companiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 Whether they are Shah Rukh, Salman, Aamir or Hrithik
 sabaki apni-apni prabal companiyaan hai
 Blessed are those who understand
 mujhe to samaj aata nahin
 Any role or film that you later regret doing? 
 
 na
 
 
 never mean
 hamane prayek film kii, us par garv he
 Are you recording Harivansh Rai Bachchan's Jana Geetha? Running
 abhi samay to hamane koi nirdhaarit nahin kiya he
 We have just recorded Hanuman Chalisa
 sundarkand par kaam chal rahaa he
 What the Jana Geeta is is a translation of the Gita
 babuji ne iskaa anuwaad tulsidas kii ramayana kii bhashaa main kiya he or aisa pehali baar hua he
 Must be heard soon
 bollywood shabd istemaal karnaa pasand nahin karte
 Do you still stand by your word? Yes
 mujhe lagata he ki yah sahi naam nahin he
 Still it has become so popular? Skip popular, now it has reached the dictionary
 nahin, hamako ab bhi acha nahi lagata
 We like the Indian film industry
 akasar aapako or parivaar ko lekar kai gocips akhabaaron main chhapate hai, ab inkaa koi asar hota he?aap aise vyavsaay main hai jo public life se judaa he
 Often this is printed
 log jaananaa chaahate hai ki ham kya karte hai, khate or kya pahante hai
 Now, different magazines also come out on clothes
 baaten jaanane ke liye utsukata rahati he
 Everything is just for that
 is umr main bhi itane active kaise rahete hai?main yah maanata hum ki jab tak sharir chal rahaa he, jis tarah kaa kaam karne ko mil rahaa he, use kar paata hum to main kar letaa hum
 Advise Aishwarya and Abhishek on career? No
 
 
 nahin
 They are capable of themselves

 vahiin karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki agar hamaari maang nahin maani gai to ham somvaar se hadtaal karenge
 What does the union have to say? Devendra Sharma, the union president of the employees, says that the officials are doing wrong with us

 In such a situation, the cleaning situation in Noida can be very bad
 abhi barish kaa samay he
 In such a situation, electricity problems are also seen many times
 agar ye karmchaaree hadtaal par rahe to bijli ko lekar bhi samasya hogi
 That is, the government will also have to do something soon

 uttarakhand main congress sarkaar ko samarthan de rahe progressive democratic front (peedief) ke adhikansh vidhayakon ko mantri banane ke maamle ne congress ko saansat main daal diya he
 The seven mlas of the PDF include three Independents, one from Ukrand and three from the BSP
 unamem se paanch vidhayakon ko mantri pad dene ke khilaaf congress ke ek dhade ke vidhayakon main naaraazgi rahi
 The same issue dominated the Congress churning camp
 isaki mukhaalafat main mukhya taur par ve congressi vidhayak shaamil hai, jo mantrimandal main jagah paane ke liye aatur hai
 At the end of the entire camp, Chief Minister Harish Rawat strongly objected
 unhone yah bhi saaf kar diya ki mantrimandal main peedief kaa kota kam nahin hoga or peedief sarkaar ke saath bana rahegaa
 After that, the government may also find it difficult to run for six months
 darasal pichhlaa upachunaav jite congressi vidhayak hira singh bisht ne party ke 15 vidhayakon ke hastakshar karwaakar peedief ke mantriyon ko kam karne ke liye kendriya prabharee ko ek patr saunpa
 Vijay Bahuguna also gave his consent to this
 yah maamla saamne aate hi peedief kaa naaraaz hona lajimi tha
 Sensing their displeasure, the Chief Minister expressed strong reservations about this and assured the ministers of the PDF that he would remain with them
 siyaasi daanv-pech main maahir ravat ke is aashwaasan se peedief ne bahuguna ko nishane par lekar unke liye musiibat badha di he
 Due to this, Bahuguna, who is busy with his life to adjust his loved ones, has come on the defensive
 vahiin bahuguna samarthak ise ravat kii sajeesh bataa rahe hai, jabaki peedief ke sadsy khuleam mukhyamantri kii tarif karne main or bahuguna ko kosne main jute hai
 Tourism minister Dinesh Dhanai of PDF quota even called Bahuguna even stabbing him in the back
 unhone kaha, “jab mukhyamantri bananaa tha to bahuguna ne mujhe hi saath lekar dilli hikeman ko nirdaliyon ke saath dene kaa bharosa dilaayaa, nahin to bahuguna sapane main bhi mukhyamantri nahin ban pate
 Now Bahuguna, who has lost the chief minister's chair, is trying to get me removed
 ” peedief cote se hi mantri bane mantriprasad naithani bhi kehete hai, “bahuguna kii peedief par tippaniyan behad dukhadaayi hai
 He himself became Chief Minister with the help of PDF
 ”mukhyamantri se abhaydaan paakar peedief or zyada taqatvar ho gaya he
 This led Halkan Bahuguna to argue in his defense, "I never demanded the removal of PDF ministers from the government
 maine to bas kharaab pradarshan vaale mantriyon ko hataane kii baat kahi he
 Be it PDF or Congress
 ”haalanki congress sarkaar 35 nirvaachit or ek manonith vidhayak ke boote sadan main bahumat yani 36 vidhayakon ke aankade ko chhu leti he
 But the way the bickering party is going on from time to time in the Rawat and Bahuguna camp, touching the majority figure will not work
 aise main peedief kaa saath chhootane kaa sidhaa matlab sarkaar par sankat he
 The Chief Minister knows this very well
 peedief ke saat vidhayakon ke saath ho jane par congress sarkaar 43 sadasyon ke saath nishcint avasthaa main he
 If PDF leaves the government, the opposition can easily put it in trouble whenever it wants
 daayitv vitaran ke liye jor-aajamaaish main jute congress netaa bhi mukhyamantri ke sakht rukh se baikfoot par aa gaye hai
 The Chief Minister has clearly said that they should be allowed to work openly for six months so that they can make the path of Mission 2017 easier
 unhone manthan shivi main kaha, “kya 2002 main tiwari sarkaar main tamaam laal battiyaan vitarit karne ke baavjood 2007 main sarkaar laut pai? agar lalabattiyon or dayitvon ke vitaran se sarkaar lautne vaali hoti to tab jarur lautati
 Therefore workers must be patient
 ”1 farvari, 2014 ko rajya kii satta kii kaman sanbhaalane vaale ravat 2017 main prastaavit vidhansabha chunaavon main congress kii satta main vaapasi karaane ke liye harsambhav koshish main jute hai
 But BJP is also very excited by Narendra Modi's wave
 isliye mukhyamantri bhaleebhanti jaanate hai ki peedief se naata todgaye par congress par vishwasghaatee hone kaa daag lag saktaa he or bhavishya main party ko bahari samarthan kii jarurat padane par raah mushkil ho sakati he
 At present, the ministers of the PDF are fully under the control of the Chief Minister
 agar unki jagah party ke vidhayakon ko mantri banaaya gaya to peedief ke mantri unke niyantran se baahar bhi ho sakate hai
 Vijay Bahuguna, on the other hand, has been seen as helpless in keeping his supporters united since he lost the chief minister's chair
 unki sansadeey seat maani jane vaali tehri se peedief ke do mantri bhi unke liye khatra badha rahe hai
 The growing strength of Independent MLA Dinesh Dhanai from Tehri and Pritam Singh Panwar, MLA from Yamunotri to Ukrand, is haunting Bahuguna
 pichley loksabhaa chunaavon main donon vidhayakon ne unke bete saket bahuguna ke liye kaam nahin kiya tha, jisase ve baari maton se haar gaye
 When Rawat became Chief Minister in place of Bahuguna, Dhanai played an important role in keeping the PDF united and in favor of Rawat
 us vakt bahuguna se kaha gaya tha ki unke samarthakon ko spikar, pradesh adhyaksh or rajyasabha seat milegi lekin mila kuch bhi nahin
 Now his reputation is also in trouble
 congress ke pradesh adhyaksh kishor upaadhyaay bhi apni paramparaagat tehri seat ko lekar phikrmand hai
 He lost the 2012 assembly election to Dhanai there
 ab dhanai ke mantri banate hi unhen apni jameen khisakati najar aa rahi he
 For this reason, they too started getting closer to Bahuguna, in tune to reduce the quota of PDF
 lekin mukhyamantri ke sakht tevar dekh ve bhi ekaek paala badalte najar aae
 He said, “my concern was about the strength of the Congress organization in the seats of independents and other PDF members
 isliye main chahta tha ki peedief ke mantri congress kii upeksha band karen
 "regarding the neglect of Congressmen, the Chief Minister has clearly told the ministers of PDF that they should also meet the demands of public interest being raised by the Congress workers
 ravat ne ramnagar kii vidhayak rahi amrutha ravat kaa mantri pad chhinakar or unki jagah peedief cote ko dekar apane prabhaav kaa ehsaas kara diya he
 Despite Bahuguna's lakhs of attempts, Rawat had also defeated him by giving ticket to Manorama Sharma of his choice in the Rajya Sabha seat
 ve pradesh adhyaksh pad par bhi apane hi chahete kishor upaadhyaay ko adhyaksh bana le gaye
 Now Bahuguna has to face the PDF issue again
 bahuguna camp to philhal post ho gaya he lekin peedief ko lekar hue hangaame ne congress kii andruni kalah ko sataha par jarur laa diya he
 This is a matter of concern for him
 is mudde ne yah bhi saaf kar diya he ki ravat or bahuguna dhadon main banty party main ravat dhada hi dinodin taqatvar hota ja rahaa he

 After the death of the first wife, Pawan Singh's name was associated with many actresses, all of whom Pawan Singh called it a rumor
 mashhoor bhojpuri gayak pawan singh kii patni ne aatmahatya keembhook Review: talash bhojpuri bhashaayi asmita kii Amid growing controversy over land acquisition, the government on Friday introduced a new Land Acquisition Bill, which sets out a transparent legal framework aimed at providing adequate compensation to landowners and rehabilitating the displaced
 bahu pratikshit rashtriya bhoomi adhigrahan evam punarvaas va punasrthapana vidheyak, 2011 ke masaude main kaha gaya he, shahari ilaakon ke maamle main muaavja raashi bazaar mulya ke dogune se kam nahin hogi, jabaki gramin ilaakon main yah bazaar mulya ke chah guna se kam nahin hogi
 The draft of the bill proposes that if the government acquires land for the purpose of private companies for public purpose or PPP projects other than national highways, it will be mandatory to get the consent of 80 percent of the families affected by the project
 masaude main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki jis saarvajanik kaary kaa ullekh hoga usamen baad main badlaav nahin kiya ja sakegaa
 The draft suggested that under no circumstances multi-cropped, irrigated land would be acquired
 is tarah kii adhikansh bhoomi punjab, haryana, uttar pradesh, pashchim bengal or bihar ke ganga ke maidan main sthit hai
 Also, the government will not acquire land for private purpose on behalf of private companies
 gramin vikaas mantri jairam ramesh ne kaha ki bharat main bhoomi kaa bazaar kaaphi trutipurna he
 It is written in the Preamble of the draft that there is a huge imbalance in the rights and information of the people who want to acquire the land and whose land is being acquired
 yahi vajah he ki sarkaar ko paardarshee evam lacheele niyam lagu karne main bhoomika adaa kerani pad rahi he jisase ise lagu kiya janaa sunishchit ho sake
 The draft of the Bill proposes to authorize the government to implement emergency rules for the acquisition of land in matters of defense and security of the country
 sarkaar apatkaal yaa prakritik aapadaaon kii sthiti main punasrthapana evam punarvaas kii jaruraton ko puraa karne evam kisi durlabh maamalon main bhoomi kaa adhigrahan kar sakegi
 The features of the draft bill include a comprehensive rehabilitation package for landowners and people who have lost their means of livelihood
 inamen ve log bhi shaamil hai, jo roji-roti ke liye adhigrahit kii ja rahi bhoomi par nirbhar hai
 The draft includes a pension facility of Rs 3,000 per family per month for 12 months and Rs 2,000 per family for 20 years
 saath hi isamen parivaar ke ek sadsy ko rojgaar uplabdh karana or agar rojgaar evam anya protsaahanon kii peshkash nahin kii jaati, to do lakh rupee uplabdh karaane kii anivaaryta he
 The draft for landowners also provides that if the landowner's land is acquired for an irrigation project, one acre of land in the project area should be made available to each family
 shaharikaran ke liye bhoomi adhigrahan ke maamle main viksit bhoomi kaa 20 pratishat arakshit kiya jayega or adhigrahit bhoomi ke anupaat main maalikon ko uski peshkash kii jaaegi
 On the other hand, if tribal land is acquired, one acre land should be given to each scheduled tribe family in each project
 isamen yah bhi kaha gaya he ki jin pariwaron kii jameen kaa adhigrahan kiya ja rahaa he, use 50,000 rupee bataur ekamusth vittiya sahaayta di jaani chahie
 Ramesh said that Land Acquisition and Rehabilitation and Resettlement has been included in a Bill, as these are two sides of a coin

 India has become the sixth largest market for illegal cigarettes in the world
 ek anumaan ke mutabik desh main iskaa kareeb 2000 karod rupee kaa kaarobaar hota he
 The survey conducted by ASSOCHAM states that while the business of illegal cigarettes results in loss of revenue to the government, the livelihood of about 50 lakh tobacco-producing farmers is affected
 adhyayan main andeh jataayaa gaya he ki is kaarobaar se hone vaali aay kaa istemaal aatankwaadiyon ko aarthik madad pahunchane main bhi kiya jaataa he
 Renowned research organization Euromonitor in its recent study has stated that such cigarettes do not pay excise, VAT, customs or other taxes, hence are available at a cheaper and attractive price
 varsh 2006-7 main 109 arab cigarette kaa utpaadan hua tha
 In 2010-11, this number came down to about 101 billion
 euromonitor ne bharat main avaidh cigarette kaarobaar kaa aakaar or badhane kaa anumaan jaahir kiya he
 According to the study, illegal cigarettes in India amount to about Rs 2000 crore per year
 aisi cigarette main bharat main utpaadit tambaakoo kaa istemaal nahin hota he jisase pehle se hi vipareet paristhitiyon kii maar jhel rahe desh ke tambaakoo kisaanon kii rojiroti par khatra mandaraane laga he
 The problem of illegal cigarettes is especially serious in urban areas, but the whole country has come under its control
 sabase khaas yah he ki taskari ke jariye aane vaale cigarette par cigarette evam anya tambaakoo utpaada adhinium (kotpa) ke tahat anivaary rup se di jane vaali aarekh chetavanee bhi nahin hoti he, jisase sarkaar kii tambaakoo niyantran niti bhi khatai main padati dikhaai detii he
 Due to the lack of retail sale price on such cigarette boxes, smugglers and those who do business in the market earn a good income
 bhartiya bazaar main aisi cigarette china, myamar, bangladesh, indonesia, pakistan, khadi deshon, dakshin purvi asian deshon or yahaan tak ki europea deshon se taskari hoti he
 Social activist Anna Hazare said that in true democracy, real power should ideally be in the hands of the people, which is in the hands of a select few

 Anna Hazare said that crores of rupees are spent today (from the government) but only 10 percent of that amount reaches the people
 aisi sthiti main bharat kaa koi bhavishya nahin he
 Describing centralization of power as the main reason for corruption in the country, he said that decentralization of power is the need of the hour and local self-government units like gram sabhas need to be strengthened

 dilli ajtak ke antraprenyor summit main kai aise logon ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha jinhone apane str par kaam shuru kiya or kamyaabi hasil karne ke baad samaaj kaary main jud gaye
 The name of one such person associated with Delhi is Sanjay Gupta, who achieved success in the world of advertising and then wants to taste success in the world of politics while being in social work
 enji aids and soshal varkar ke maalik sanjay gupta ne kaha ki 2002 main bijness kii duniya main kadam rakhaa or ek dashak tak kamyaabi hasil karne ke baad samajaseva karne kaa sochaa or kai maamalon main logon kii madad bhi kii
 Sanjay Gupta said that the most important feature of your channel is that when you feel that something is happening that needs to be shown, then your channel shows
 dilli ajtak ke antraprenyor summit main unhone kaha, 'shuruyaat main maine sochaa ki zyada paisa kamaane ke bare main vigyaapan kii duniya main jaaenge
 There was no idea of starting a business while staying in many departments during the job, but later when it came to the advertising department, it was felt that the business could be started
 'ek afasar kaa udhaahrandilli ajtak ke antraprenyor summit main apane ek senior tex adhikari kii eemaandaaree baat karte hue sanjay gupta ne kaha ki vah kuch galat hone nahin dete the or kuch aisa kar dete the ki saamne vaala majaboor ho jaataa tha ki use sahi tareeke se tex bharna padataa tha
 Giving examples, he said that once a company asked for permission to advertise on a car, but it took the permission of 200 cars and placed advertisements on its 1200 cars
 is par us adhikari ne us company ko 5000 kaaron par vigyaapan lagane kaa notice thama diya or iske liye jurmaana bharne ko kaha
 On this, the company said that it has 1200 cars and not 5000 cars
 phir adhikari ne use 1200 kaaron par vigyaapan kaa tex bharne ko kaha
 In this way, he recovered the entire account without doing anything
 samaaj seva karne ke baad raajnneeti main jane ke bare main kaha ki abhi meraa ek hi makasad he ki modi ji (narendra modi) se mulaakaat ho, ab dekhte hai ki kab meri tamanna puri hoti he, ab tak jo samaaj kaary kiya he use sahi tareeke se aage badhanaa he
 Regarding contesting elections, he said that after winning the election, he should go to a House and take forward the policies
 modi se mulaakaat ho
 i want me to be nominated
 iske liye koshish bhi kar rahaa hum
 To promote the youth, Sanjay Gupta said that youths should be included in the committees of the Municipal Corporation or the committees of the Central Government, who are proficient in the department concerned
 unhone bataaya ki 16 saal kii umr main naukari shuru kii, phir 2000 main bijness shuru kiya or 2012 main samajaseva main lag gaya
 In future, social service has to be done now because after a lot of work, social service now gives satisfaction
 dilli main work culture ke bare main sanjay gupta ne kaha ki dilli main vishwastareey vikaas nahin ho rahaa kyonki aapas main samanvay hi nahin he
 Now horticulture, electric and civil departments are responsible for the development of the park, but there is no coordination, due to which there are problems
 jargar ne bataaya ki seva pradaata pawan hans prali helicopter ke prayek chakkar ke liye ek-ek lakh rupee kiraaya legaa

 ' The Central Government has decided to distribute subsidized pulses through the postal network to make pulses available to the people at the right prices during this festival season
 daalon par ye faisla upabhokta maamalon ke antar mantralayan samiti main liya gaya
 This committee reviewed the availability and prices of essential commodities, mainly pulses and this committee suggested that due to the lack and lack of government outlets in the states, the postal network spread across the country should be used for pulses distribution

 It is worth mentioning that the center is importing pulses from abroad for its supply, but now the pulses will not reach the more expensive public, so that cheap pulses will be sent to the people through post

 The bjp-ruled central government was unilaterally attacked by AAP minister Satyendar Jain, accusing him of harassing traders
 ceiling ke mudde par sawaal puche jane par jain ne kaha, '100% epadiai kii khabar chupaane ke liye ceiling shuru kii gai vyapaariyon ko ceiling main ulajhaa diya gaya he or bijepi pryojit ceiling karvaa rahi he
 While the central government can provide relief from sealing by bringing an ordinance '
 Entrepreneur Confrence main satyendra jain ne daawa kiya ki 16 march se shuru hone ja rahi vidhansabha ke bajet satr main sarkaar ceiling par bill paas karne ja rahi he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has completed 3 years in power in Delhi

 In the Entrepreneur Confrence of 'delhi-aaj Tak', Minister Satyendra Jain claimed that 85% of the population of Delhi gets the benefit of electricity subsidy in winter and 80% in summer

 Let me tell you, when Minister Satyendra Jain was asked about his weight loss, he said that because of this, he stays away from stress, although there is a lot of tension in the people around him
 saath hi jain ne bataaya ki in dinon ve ekasana kar rahe hai joki jain dharm kaa ek niyam he
 According to this rule, food is eaten only once a day and in the last 170 days, they have lost 20 kg weight through Ekasana
 dilli ko di-kanjest karne ke bare main bataate hue jain ne kaha, 'dilli ek trade hub he yahaan trade ko marane nahi dena chahie
 Earlier, if 1 lakh people used to come to Delhi to do business or work, then 2 lakh people go to work or trade in NCR
 isse na koi suvidha mili balki dilli ko barbaad kiya ja rahaa he'
 On the question of finding time for himself in politics, Satyendra Jain said that 'I am not in politics, politics seems abusive
 jab mujhe tikat mila to pita ne kaha ki chunaav ladanaa gunde badmaashon kaa kaam he
 In 5 years it became known that there are very dirty people not dirty in politics
 maine kai baar sochaa ki raajnneeti chhod dena chahie
 But then dirty people will enter politics so we do not run away from the ground '

 bhaajapa ke salaah-mashvira nahin karne se naaraaz shivasena ne to rishte lagbhag tod hi liye hai
 They are also incensed by what they call the misguidedness of his leadership and the unconvincing attitude of himself
 alabatta duusare sahyogi dalon kii nakhushi ke peeche aisi vajahen hai jinhen party unki "alag-alag or gaiyr-paaramparik'' maangen kahati he or jinhen paardarshita ke prati patibaddh sarkaar puraa nahin kar sakati
 But of course, she can fulfill some other demands
 bartaav kaa yahi dharra party ke bheetar bhi dusron ko chubh rahaa he
 a leader who has seen the party grow over the years says, "both the top leaders have had a lot of time as they are immersed in running the government and growing the party
" iske alaava ve apane hukum manwaane ke aadi ho gaye hai
 So they do not have much scope for consultation
 badakismati se kaam karne kii yahi style nichle darje ke duusare netaaon kii bhi pahchaan ban rahi he, jo khatarnaak he
 This type of trend is growing, especially after the party this year, one after another in states like Karnataka after Rajasthan (where it has been in power for five years) and Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh (where it has been in power since 2003)
 Will contest elections
 kai ahm ohadon par rah chuke party ke ek kaaryakarta kehete hai, "nabbe fisadi nuksaan party kii is chhavi kii vajah se ho rahaa he ki vah ghamandi or magarur ho gai he
 If we improve this image then things can change
 agar ham logon ke bich dharna kii ladaai haar gaye to samajho, ham zyada bada khel bhi haar gaye
 Then no matter how good our government is
 '' ye kaaryakarta kehete hai ki unhen modi sarkaar kii saaf-suthri chhavi, bhrashtachar se ladgaye kii uski koshishon or uttar-purv main uske vistaar par garv he, par ve samaj nahin pate ki dalbadaluon or vipaksh ke badnaam netaaon ko shaamil karne kii party ko itani utaavali kyon he
 On the other hand, the top leaders of the party say in clarification that this is being done because the BJP needs to strengthen the caste base of the party by bringing in leaders from outside
 party ne jab maharashtra ke purv mukhyamantri narayan rane ko rajyasabha ke tikat se nawaja, tab bhi party ke bheetar bhaunhen tani thim
 Rane, a former Shiv Sainik and later a Congressman, is beset by allegations of corruption and was badly defeated in the 2014 assembly elections
 samaajawaadee party ke netaa naresh agarwal kaa maamla or bhi badtar he, jinhen rajyasabha kaa tikat katane kii vajah se samaajawaadee party chhodie ke baad party main khushi-khushi le liya gaya
 Says a BJP leader, he is the same Agrawal who has never shied away from making a pro-pakistan statement with the thunderous Muslim votes
 party ke kuch netaa maanate hai ki asantosh ke peeche bhaajapa ke kuch baari-bharkam vaade bhi jimmedaar hai
 By 2022, the government's promise of a house for all seems to be fulfilled in rural areas, but in urban areas, where the lack of land has slowed down
 phir kheti-kisaani kaa sankat to bana hi hua he, haalanki sarkaar jaldi hi ghoshit kii jane vaali nunatam samarthan mulya kii nai niti se ise hal karne kii ummid kar rahi he
 But it is the dissatisfaction of the middle class that is proving to be the biggest challenge for the BJP
 party ke kuch nishchit tabakon kii raay he ki bhaajapa ne madhyam varg kaa jabardast samarthan hasil karne ke baavjood use bisar diya he
 It was the middle class that supported the Modi government's demonetisation and then GST, yet it did not get anything in the budget of 2018-19
 iskaa ek doosraa pahalu bhi he
 Even after four years of the Modi government, people remain untainted by any scam
 vijay maalya or neerav modi ke bare main poochne par party adhyaksh amit shah kehete hai ki ye apwaad hai or inamen party kaa koi bada netaa shaamil nahin he, jaisaa ki upie ke ghotaalon main hua karata tha (dekhen baatcheet)
 There is no widespread public discontent against the government and this is the reason why very few people attended the Anna Hazare rally in New Delhi last week in favor of justice for the Lokpal and farmers
 bhaajapa mahasachiv anil jain kehete hai, "anna hajaare ko mili logon kii berukhi saaf-saaf dikhaati he ki modi sarkaar logon ke bich kitni lokapriy he
 "shah also says that these defeats are being overstated and after identifying the reasons for these, the party will take steps for reform
" bhaajapa ke netaaon kii ek baithak jaldi hi hone vaali he, jisamen rajg kii sahyogi partiyon ko sanbhaalane ke bare main vichaar kiya jayega
 But before that both Shah and Modi will have to change their attitude and their working style simultaneously and include more consultation in it
 unhen apane aasapaas kuch zyada tape-tapaae netaaon ko laana hoga or unhen rajg ke sahyogi dalon ko sanbhaalane kii jimmedaari saunpny hogi
 Vishnu Pandya, an author of Padma Shri, who comes from an RSS background, who has seen the political rise of Modi and Shah, points to another interesting point: "the party is unable to maintain the old areas, like the north-east
" His conquests continue in new areas
 uske jite hue puraane ilaakon ko ganvaane kii kuch vajah yah ho sakati he ki party kii rajya sarkarein centre sarkaar kii duuradrushti ke saath kadamtal karte hue nahin chal paa rahi hai
 And some of the reason for this may also be the belief that the central government is not fulfilling its promises
 '' saaf he ki 2019 ke liye qamar kasne ke alaava bhi party ko bahut kuch karnaa hoga
 Anything less than a radical change in working style will not work

 Expressing concern over the behavior of airline employees, a number of incidents of misbehavior and beatings have come to light on behalf of employees of airline companies

 Naming the airline company indigo, the committee has given a strong comment in its report and instructed the company's ground staff and cabin crew to change their behavior

 There have been allegations that the check-in procedures at airports are long and annoying
 samiti ne khaas taur par kam kiraye vaali companiyon ke check-in countaron kii haalat gadabad pai
 The committee even says that these counters deliberately put long long lines so that passengers take long time to check in the luggage so that their flight is missed and they can be forced to take expensive tickets for the next flight

 Afzal Guru's family has formally written a letter to the Tihar Jail authorities to hand over the dead body to take him to Kashmir

 The letter said that they should start the process on their behalf to take the body to Kashmir

 The letter states that after making a list, the items related to Afzal should be kept in a safe place so that it can be handed over to Afzal's lawyers
 vakeelon ne kaha ki afjal kii kabr par fatiha padhane kii maang par jail adhikariyon ke taraf se koi bhi pratikriya nahin milane ke kaaran parivaar pareshaan he

 In the elections held for three Rajya Sabha seats in Gujarat, BJP captured two seats
 haalanki yahaan sabase zyada charchaa teesri seat par congress ke 'chanakya' ahamed patel ko mili jeet kii he
 The results came after nearly 10 hours of high-voltage drama on Tuesday after voting for the Rajya Sabha election, in which BJP President Amit Shah and Union Minister Smriti Irani got 46–46 votes, while Ahmed Patel won with 44 votes
 rajya kii 176 sadasyeey vidhansabha main 2 congressi vidhayakon ke vot radd hone ke baad jeet kaa aankada 43
 51 reached
 aise main patel kii jeet kaa antar bhale hi maamuli dikhe, lekin rajya kii siyasat ke hisaab se dekhen to bade myne rakhti he
 There was a very aggressive preparation by Amit Shah & Co
 to defeat Ahmad Patel, political advisor to Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 ek vakt to laga ki amit shah ne maano patel ko haraane kii thaan rakhi he
 At the same time, the Congress also accused them of using cases, prices, punishments, and discrimination to defraud their mlas
 aise main chunavi nateezon ke baad ek baat to saaf in ladaai main congress hi vijeta banakar ubhari
 Assembly elections are due in Gujarat later this year
 isi vajah se aam taur par bina kisi shor-sharabe ke nipat jane vaale rajyasabha chunaav main is baar khub hangaamaa dekhne ko mila tha
 Here all these exercises of political expert Amit Shah had to create a psychological edge over the Congress before the elections in the state
 haalanki is ladaai main congress hi vijeta banakar ubhari, jo uske liye sanjivani jaisi he
 It is also worth noting that Shankarsingh Vaghela, one of the tallest leaders of Gujarat, left the Congress party just before the Rajya Sabha elections
 waghela kii is ghoshnaa ke samay congress ne ise zyada tarjeeh na dete hue kaha tha ki unke jane se party ko koi khaas nuksaan nahin hoga
 However, in these elections, a split within the Congress made the party realize the power of the Vaghela camp in due course of time
 aise main party ke paas is nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye ab samay mil jayega
 In fact, this time the Congress is hoping to overthrow the BJP from power by cashing discontent with the Patidars, Dalits and other backward sections in the state
 yahaan rajyasabha main agar uski fajihat hoti, to uske liye rajya main uske liye vikalp ke rup main logon kaa bharosa jeetna thodaa mushkil ho jaataa
 In such a situation now, this victory of Ahmed Patel has certainly raised a hope within the Congress, although the party will need to keep the party workers awake to the victory in the Gujarat Assembly elections and go to the polls with full energy

 com / cjktbuejox Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, who embarked on a Gandhi Vichar Padyatra to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, has rejected the idea of bjp's nationalism
 unhone kaha ki congress kaa rashtrawaad vahi he jo mahatma gandhi kaa rashtrawaad kaa vichaar tha, yani asahmati rakhane vaale ko bhi saath rakhana or sammaan dena
 Baghel said that bjp's nationalism was the same as that of Nathuram Godse's nationalism
 yani, asahmati rakhane vaale ko mitaa dena, unhen samaapt kar dena
 Chief Minister Baghel is on a Gandhi Vichar Yatra from 4 to 10 October
 india today se baatcheet main mukhyamantri ne daawa kiya ki gandhi kii vichaardhaara par congress na sirf ab tak chali he balki hameshaa kaayam rahegi
 He said that if the BJP and Modi had followed the path of Mahatma Gandhi, neither would there have been mob lynching, nor would there have been a sedition case against those writing against him, nor would the insinuation of the big leaders of his party within the BJP 
 desh kii aarthik badahaali kaa zikr karte hue baghel ne daawa kiya ki yah ek auki namoona he jo sabit karata he ki sirf congress gandhi ke vichaar par chal rahi he
 Baghel said, "gandhi used to strengthen the weak people of the society
 hamane chhattisgarh main yahi kiya
 Gave money in the hands of people, did not give money to corporate like BJP
 isliye jab puraa desh bheeshan aarthik mandi main he chhattisgarh main kahi bhi mandi nahi he
 "the Chief Minister said that there is a slowdown in the auto sector in the country but Chhattisgarh recorded a growth of 13 per cent
 dastavej panjikaran or rajasav aay main jabardast oochaal he
 The bullion market has recorded a 52 per cent growth
 yah sab isliye sambhav hua kyonki rajya sarkaar ne logon tak paise pahunchaae
 The Chief Minister claimed that the support price of paddy was Rs
 2,500
 karne se logon ke haath main paise gaye
 Baghel said that his government does not benefit by giving money to corporate, so there is no recession in Chhattisgarh
 modi ne korporate gharaanon ko laabh pahunchaaya, so aarthik mandi ghatane kii jagah bad rahi he

 punjab ke captain or gendbaaj aswin ne bina gend phenke hi non striking chor par khadey jose butler ko ran out kar maankading vivaad ko hawa de di
 He did not even warn Butler before he was dismissed
 iske baad diggaj khilaadiyon samet cricket kanoonon kaa sangrakshak maane jane vaale merilabone cricket club (emsisi) ne aswin kii is harakat ko khel bhaavana ke khilaaf bataaya tha
 MCC said, 'after reviewing the case, we do not think it was under sportsmanship
 hamaara maananaa he ki aswin ne krij par pahunchane or tehraav ke bich zyada samay liya tha
 So the batsman hopes that the ball is thrown
 butler ne aisa hi sochaa hoga ki gend phenk di gai he or vah apane kshetra main tha
 At the same time, former Indian cricketer Madan Lal said that Ashwin should have avoided it
 unhone kaha, 'aswin ke str or antarrashtriya kariyar ko dekhte hue mujhe nahin lagata ki unhone sahi kiya
 He is a very big player and such an act is a very small thing
 butler kii jagah agar viraat kohli yaa koi anya bhartiya khilaadi hota to uski kaaphi aalochana hoti
 Such action is not a part of the game
 aswin apni jagah sahi hai
 But, they should not have done so
 ’england ke captain eon morgan ne kaha, 'jo maine dekha, us par bharosa nahin ho rahaa
 The wrong example was set for young players
 aswin ko is par jarur khed hoga
 "england player Jason Rai said," Ashwin had this shocking behavior

 The problem of forgetting is common in people
 aksar log rosemara kii baton ko bhi bhul jate hai
 Forgetting things, earlier it was considered as a disease of only the elderly, but nowadays this disease is engulfing the youth as well as children
 kya he alzimerdarasal, alzimer bhuulane kii beemaari he
 It is named after Doctor Alois Alzheimer's
 inhone hi sabase pehle alzimer beemaari ke bare main jaankaree di thi
 Alzheimer's problem occurs due to disturbances in the structure of proteins in the brain
 pehle 70 saal se upar ke logon main alzimer hota tha
 Now even in 40 years, people are falling victim to this disease
 kyon manaaya jaataa he alzimer deduniya bhar main 21 sitambar world alzimer de ke naam se manaaya jaataa he
 Nowadays this problem is constantly increasing
 alzimer se peedit logon ke prati ekajutata dikhaane ke liye puri duniya main 21 sitambar ko 'vishwa alzimer diwas' manaaya jaataa he
 Symptoms of Alzheimer's Doctors believe that forgetting small things is common but if there are some special symptoms that should not be ignored
 agar aapke saath bhi ho rahaa he aisa to satark ho jaaen
 - Rapid changes in everyday routine
 - kisi kaam main man ekagra nahin hona
 - Lack of confidence when making necessary decisions
 - saamaanya baatcheet main baar-baar shabd bhoolanaa, vaakya nahin ban paanaa
 - Helping to keep memory sharp by getting entangled in everyday paths - More real-world contact with social media
 -khel kii gatividhiyon or uchit vyaayaam se sharir or dimagi tandoorusti bani rahati he
 - Angry, stay away from irritability
 khud bhi khush rahen or duusare ko bhi khush rakhen
 - Take healthy diet and control high blood pressure, diabetes

 Where he made a unique reveal of his college days

 My friend made a story and said that the food in our college mess is over and we have nothing to eat
 "unhone kaha, "haalanki hamane us vakt khaanaa khaaya hua tha or ankal ne hamaare upar khaanaa khaane or naachne ke liye jor daalaa
 We had our food twice and then danced
 yah ek aisa anubhav tha, jise main kabhi nahin bhul saktaa
 "need ur blessings 😊🙏pic
 twitter
 com / 3jyyjlw8g7 — KAPIL (@ kapilsharmak9) November 27, 2018 There are only a few days left for Kapilki's wedding
 ye shaadi jalandhar main punjabi parampara ke mutabik hogi
 Kapil recently shared the wedding card on social media
 is bich ek intervyuu main ginni ne kapil ke saath apni romantic kahani saajha kii
 In a conversation with DNA, Ginni had said, "I have known Tokpilco since college days
 feelings kii baat karun to wo college ke dinon main hi aa gai thi
 i always cooked and took food for Kapil in college
 kapil mujhe naaraaz hone par bhi aasaani se manaa lete hai
 He is a human being living with family
 jis tarah kapil apni maa or bahan kaa khyaal rakhte hai, yahi sabase acchhee cheez mujhe lagati he
 " mahakavi najim hikmat kii ek kavita main kuch panktiyaan is tarah hai: ''mere paas ek choti-si pencil thi / jise maine ek hafte main ghis daalaa / agar tum pencil se pucho, vah kahegi, 'meri samoochee zindagi' / agar tum mujhase pucho, main kahuunga / 'kahaan?
 
 
 just one week
 ' zindagi ke bare main bhi aisa hi ek muhaavara he—chaar din kii jindagi
 From this point of view, only then can the five days in heaven be truly understood and appreciated in the new journeys of har-aziz Adib Asghar Wajahat of our times
 asagar bahut urvar rachanaakaar hai
 He gave the best story like Seven Skies to Hindi, not Lakhore
 
 
 jaise kaaljayi naatak se samakaleen rangamanch ko samrudh kiya, filmein banaain or shahalam camp kii ruhen jaisi vicharottejak kahani likhi
 He is also the non-stop traveler to Rahul Sankrityayan, Nagarjuna's stroller to the present, and has given us very interesting and informative journeys from countries like Iran, Jordan etc
 samikshya kriti bhi ek safarnama hi he or iske centre main he purvi europe kaa desh hungary
 Asghar has been traveling to Mutwatir Hungary since 1989 and has been there as a visiting professor for a full five years, from 1992–97
 unhone vahaan ke kone-kone ko, roen-reshe ko ek jigyaasu or hardik kii drushti se dekha or ek itihaasanveshi, ek samajashastri kii bhaanti us sabko apni smriti main darj kar kaagaj par utaara he
 But the quality of Hungary which deeply impressed them is the natural beauty of the place
 kehete hai, ''yadi mughal samraat shahjahan hungary aae hote to nishchit rup se kehete ki gar bahisht bar rou-e-zameen ast / hameen asto hameen asto hameen ast
 In such a paradise country, if any Dilnavaz takes five years to be just five days, then what a surprise! In the words of the author himself, in five days in heaven, "there is no memoir of a violent sojourn, nor the history, nor the socio-political Study, not a vivid analysis of Hungarian literature and the arts '', but from the point of view of a reader, it has all that, and much more, that brings Hungary closer to curious readers, Etan As he began to like Hungary, he started dreaming of it
 is yatra pustak ke shuru main hi ek 'anjaanaa itihaaskaar' hamaare saamne aa khadaa hota he
 This unknown historian wrote his history between 1200 and 1230, called Gesta Hungarorum
 anjaane itihaaskaar kii yah kaalpanik murti hungary ke kaisel of vayyadahunyad ke baahar lagi hui he
 In the statue, that unknown historian is wearing a long hoodcoat, which covers his entire head and face
 bas uski lambii naak hi najar aati he
 He recounts to the author the savory tale of the beautiful Shehzadi Emashai of Prince Onaidavalia, a clan chief settled near the Ural Mountains and the Caspian Sea, and the autobiography of a clan chieftain, and also reveals that Alamosh, born of the coincidence of the two He united the chiefs of seven tribes and said, "different blood is running in our body
 
 
 ham sabakaa khun alag he
 
 
 We are different
 
 
 hamen ek hona chahie
 
 
 Till we are not united, i will not move forward with you all
 
 
 hamaara khun mil janaa chahie, tab ham saat nahin rahenge, ek ho jaaenge
 "while the history of Hungary goes ahead with this message of unity of the ninth century, the author's travelogue also gains momentum
 is daastaan ke hawaale se arase se chali aa rahi ek galatfahami bhi dur hoti he
 Hungary has often been associated with Hunas and that Hungarian name derives from Hunas
 lekhak ke anusaar, aathvin-naunvin sadi ke aasapaas madhya europe ke is bhubhag main bas gai janajati kaa naam majyar tha
 By joining them, Hungarian name was 'majyra Song' in Hungarian
 turki jabaan main bhi hungary ko majyaristaan kaha jaataa he
 Among the merits of Hungary, which the author calls it heaven, are the kisses of kissim-kissim — from the wine of the emperors to the wine of the common people — the Hurrians born of the blending of Asia and Europe, whose "beauty is not offensive beauty" is
 unamem sahajata or saralata he
 "there are gypsy oranges who blow the keychain out of the pockets of the common people, there are art museums, buildings attached to the names of the creators, beautiful dogs are helpful to befriend beautiful women and there is snow, making different patterns, The snow gives various colors, the snow connecting the earth with the sky
 barf ke anek rangarang sansmaran hai is behad pathneey safarnaamein main
 In five days in heaven, Asghar Wajahat has revealed to us a Hungarian who is alive and alive like a dream
 *** Discussions about the political future of RJD are in full swing after Lalu Yadav was convicted in the fodder scam case
 mana ja rahaa he ki argedy kii kaman sanbhaalane or lalu yadav kii raajnneetik viraasat ko aage badhaane kaa jimmaa tejasvi yadav ke kandhon par hoga
 In such a situation, the question arises how ready is Tejashwi to take up this responsibility
 arjodi ke mushkil bhare daur main tejasvi bihar kii rajiniti main khud ko sthapit karne main kahaan tak kaamyaab ho pate hai or usamen unki party ke netaa kis had tak unki madad kar pate hai, yah to aane vaala vakt hi batayega?bihar yatra se banaai apni pahachanmahagathbandhan se jab nitish kumaar ne naata todakar bijepi ke sang sarkaar banaai, to tejasvi yadav ne unke khilaaf maahaul banane ke liye sadak par utre the
 Through this, he traveled to Bihar and spoke fiercely against Nitish and BJP
 is yatra se tejasvi kosiosi pahachanamili
 While being deputy CM, he could not make so much identity as it was after being separated from the government
 argedy ke mahasachiv ashok singh ne ajtak se baatcheet karte hue kehete hai ki lalu prasad ke insaaf ke liye tejasvi ke netritv main puri party janata kii adaalat jaaegi
 There will be travel across the state and bjp's conspiracies will be exposed
 lalu yadav ko unki vicharadhara ke chalate or ek sajeesh ke tahat lalu ke parivaar ko pareshaan kiya ja rahaa he
 Due to this there is anger among the people of the state
 tejasvi ke faislon main lalu kii jhalkatejasvi yadav apni pita lalu prasad yadav ke vicharadhara ke nakse kadam par chal rahe hai
 It was seen after breaking ties with the alliance
 nitish kumaar or bijepi kii saajha sarkaar ban jane ke baad jis tarah tejasvi yadav ne vidhansabha main apana bhaashan diya usamen lalu kii jhalak logon ko najar ai
 Senior journalist Kashi Prasad Yadav says that just as Lalu used to speak of obcs, Dalits and minority communities in his speeches, Tejashwi also strongly raises the issue of social justice and secularism
 tejasvi kii asal chunautitejasvi ke liye sanghathan ko sanbhaalane or party ko ekajute rakhane kii asli pariksha se ab gujarana hoga
 Even before the court's decision, Lalu started presenting Tejashwi as his successor
 jabaki kai varisht lalu ke is faisla ke khilaaf the, aise main tejasvi ke saamne aise netaaon ke saath santulan banaakar chalanaa ek chunauti he
 Party leader Ashok Singh says that he has all the ability inside Tejashwi to run the party
 wo varisht netaaon kaa sammaan karnaa jaanata he or yuva ko saath lekar chalanaa bhi
 In spite of all this, there is a whole party which is ready to struggle from road to MP
 vipaksh ke nishane par honge tejasvilalu kii namaujuudagi main tejasvi party kii kaman sambhalate hai to virdohi dalon ke sidhe nishane par honge
 At such a time, he has to take political steps with understanding
 varisht patrkaar kaashi yadav maanate hai ki tejasvi se lekar unke parivaar ke kai log jaanch ke ghere main he
 In such a situation, under pressure, you can take a wrong decision, which will require them to survive
 kyonki lalu hi desh main aise eklaute netaa hai, jinhone kisi bhi rup main bijepi ke saath nahin gaye hai
 Tejashwi is also following the same path, in such a situation, he will have to be prepared in advance for such pressure
 aise samay main koun khadey honge sathtejasvi ke liye asal dost pahchaan or aage saath chalane ke liye yahi vakt he
 After Lalu goes to jail, which party stands with him and who goes away
 kyonki bure daur main insaan kii parchaai bhi saath chhod det he
 This is the time for Tejashwi, when he has to identify a future friend
 maan ja rahaa he tejasvi ne apane saathi kii talash bhi kar lee he
 Recently, he had dinner with Congress President Rahul Gandhi and saw the form of Prime Minister at the time of his President's coronation
 ye baat gavaahi de rahaa he ki tejasvi ne bhavishya kaa partner congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke saath chalane kaa man banaaya he

 Is it a party that seems to be approaching power after 10 years? At least in the past three weeks there has been no evidence of this
 tikaton ko lekar maaraa-maari, virodh, khinchataan, party netaaon ke putale jalaana, nae netaaon or gathbandhanon ko lekar virodh ko saarvajanik karnaa
 Making statements against each other
 up pradhanmantri pad ke liye do-do daavedaaron ke naam aage karnaa
 Or is all this arrogance happening just because the BJP seems to be getting closer to power and every person wants their share in the monkey of power? bijepi main is vakt 'free for ol' kyon he? aisa kyon lag rahaa he ki kendriya netritv kamjor pad rahaa he? kyon party ke netaa aage nikalne ke chakkar main ek-duusare ke pairon par apane pair rakh rahe hai? agar sarkaar banane se pehle hi aapasi ladaai kaa ye haal he, to sarkaar banane par kya hoga? kya mantri banane or mantralayon ke bantwaare ke liye party ke netaa ek-duusare ke 'sir kalam' nahin kar denge? Actually, for this the basic character of the BJP has to be understood
 cader aadhaarit raajnneetik dal chaahe ve left partiyaan hon yaa phir bijepi, samuhik netritv ke siddhant par aage badhati hai

 lekin modi sarvashaktishaalee na ho jaaen, iske liye laalkrishna adwani, sushamaa swaraj jaise netaaon kii naaraazgi ko party nazarandaaj kar detii he, taaki adwani-sushamaa kii jodi modi ke baraabar santulan banaakar rakh sake
 But do the other leaders in BJP also have the same position or strength as Advani and Sushma? Can other leaders of the party also make public their displeasure and avoid the charge of not crossing the Laxman line of discipline? Probably not
 jediu se bijepi main aae sabir ali kaa party ke upaadhyaksh mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne saarvajanik rup se twitor par virodh kiya
 It can be argued that Sushma Swaraj also opposed the inclusion of Sriramulu in BJP, hence what Naqvi did wrong
 lekin nakvi ne daaud ibrahim kaa naam bijepi se jodakar chunaav ke vakt party kaa jabardast nuksaan kar daalaa
 Perhaps that is why a section of BJP is in favor of action against him along with Sabir Ali
 yah jarur he ki sabir ali ne khud hi apni sadsyta ko hold par rakhane kii baat kahkar party ko raahat de di he
 On September 13, 2013, Narendra Modi was declared the Prime Ministerial candidate
 tab raajnneetik jaankaron ne sambhaavna vyakt kii thi ki 13 sitambar ke pehle kii bijepi or 13 sitambar ke baad kii bijepi main jameen-aasmaan kaa fark hoga, kyonki netritv kaa masalaa hal hone ke baad se andruni virodh, aapasi ladaai-jhagade ab saarvajanik nahin honge, party ke netaaon ke kaam karne ke tareeke main badlaav aayega, sab ekajute hokar 10 saal se satta kaa vanvaas jhel rahi party ko sarkaar main laane ke liye kaam karenge
 But the discord of the last three weeks has pushed the party back into the race for power
 kamjor dikhataa netritv, jise party ke bheetar se hi chunauti mil rahi ho, kya bijepi ke mishan 272 ko puraa kar paaegaa? After the death of Dr
 Kalam on Monday, many interesting things related to him are being shared on social media
 bharat ke sabase sakriy raashtrapati kalam kaa sahaj hona hi unhen baakiyon se alag banaata he
 Generally, where political celebrities are seen cutting off the media, Kalam saheb probably did not consider journalists as inferior to children
 dow kalam kii baton main bachapan kii kahani 'bagpyper' vaala jaadu tha jinaki bajaai dhun ko nazarandaaz nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 In his program 'prime Time', NDTV journalist Ravish Kumar recalled Kalam Saheb, how before the press conference started, he used to instruct all journalists to sit as if children were spoken in school
 "sit down, everybody sit quietly
 " Vivek Raj, a journalist tracking international affairs, recalled Kalam's first press conference on Facebook, writing: "this was Kalam's first press conference after becoming a presidential candidate

 However, Kalam had a problem as to why the Indian media is so 'negative'? In 2005, an article by Dr
 Kalam appeared in the New Yorker magazine in which he questioned why India is so ashamed to talk about its success? Giving the example of the tribal village of Dr
 Sudarshan, he wrote that there are so many stories of success in our country, but the media never talks of such success

 'law Minister responded to Kejriwal's attack when he came to address the people
 prasad ne kaha, 'aisa kuch bhi nahin kii jajon ke phone tepe ho rahe hai, ye bilkul galat he
 Earlier, Kejriwal also attacked Prime Minister Modi in gestures and said that a particular person should not have all the power
 nyaaypalika kii azaadi ke saath koi bhi chhedhkhani chintaa kii baat he
 Kejriwal also targeted the Center without naming the tug of war between the Center and the judiciary over judicial appointments
 kejariwal ne kaha, 'maine akhbaar main padhaa collegium ne kai siforishein kii par pataa nahin kya kaaran rahaa wo post bhari nahin gayi'
 Kejriwal said that this is worrying
 aisi vyavastha honi chahie ki collegium kii sifarish karne ke 48 ghante ke andar jajon kii niyukti honi chahie
 Kejriwal said that the executive has too many powers and that the judiciary should be strong and independent so that they do not go unchallenged
 jajon kii niyukti main karypalika kaa koi dakhal nahin hona chahie or jajon ke khali padon ko jald bharaa janaa chahie
 a talk was also made on the platform between Lt
 Governor Najeeb Jung and Kejriwal

 When the Chief Justice of the country, TS Thakur started his address, it was expected that even today, he will mention about the ongoing tug of war with the Center on the appointment of judges
 lekin unhone aisa nahin kiya
 But Justice Thakur and Prime Minister Modi, who were on the stage for one and a half hours, did not talk to each other
 dilli hai court ko dilli sarkaar kii taraf se aadharbhoot suvidhaon ke liye di jane vaali madad ke liye justise thakur ne mukhyamantri kejariwal kii tarif kii
 Justice Thakur also instructed the judges to protect the image of the judiciary from being tarnished at any cost

 Modi targeted Kejriwal in gestures
 logon se mukhaatib hote hue modi ne kaha, 'mujhe kabhi court jane kaa saubhaahgya nahin praapt hua, lekin suna he vahaan gambhir charchaa hoti he'
 Modi said that every government system is trying to fulfill every need of the judiciary
 dilli hai court ke 50 saal puure hone ke maukey par modi ne kaha ki ek court ko kaamyaab tareeke se chalaane main jajon, vakeelon, court staff samet kai logon kaa haath hota he
 Even though Modi and the Chief Justice did not say anything openly on judicial appointments, but their gestures could clearly see the confrontation between the government and the judiciary

 This year, Narmada water is released from the Omkareshwar irrigation project in February in Kshipra

 Significantly, the government is bringing this bill under the name 'the Muslim Women Protection of Rights in Marriage Act'
 ye kanoon sirf teen talaak (INSTANT TALAQ, yani talaak-e-biddat) par hi lagu hoga
 After this law, if any Muslim husband gives three divorces to the wife, then it will be illegal
 iske baad se kisi bhi swaroop main diya gaya teen talaak vah chahen maukhik ho, likhit or yaa massej main, vah avaidh hoga
 Anyone who divorces three can be punished and fined for three years

 Owaisi has protested: All India Majlis-e Ittehadul Muslimeen president and MP Asaduddin Owaisi wrote a letter to the Law Minister to protest against this bill
 ovaisi ne chitthee likh kaha ki sarkaar ko is kanoon ke sambandh main ol india muslim personal lau board se raay mashvira kar unke vichaar jaanane chahie
 Muslim Personal Law Board had also opposed the Muslim Personal Law Board also opposed this bill of the government
 muslim personal lau board ke mahasachiv moulana vali rahamaani ne ajtak se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki modi sarkaar teen talaak par jo bill laa rahi he
 It is a political stand, not for the empowerment of Muslim women, but in a way
 unka kahana tha ki supreme court ne teen talaak par jo faisla diya tha, usamen kanoon banane vaale maamle 7 jajon se paanch jaj khilaaf the
 Thus, this decision was a minority decision
 aise main modi sarkaar is bill ke jariye siyasat karnaa chaahate hai
 Provision in bill against triple talaq - According to the format of the bill, triple talaq (speaking, writing or through electronic means like email, SMS and whatsapp) at one time would be illegal
 -ek baar main teen talaak gaiyrkanoonee or shunya hoga
 a husband doing so can be sentenced to three years of imprisonment
 yah gaiyr-jamaanti or sangyeya aparaadh mana jayega
 According to the draft bill, three divorces or 'talaq a biddat' at a time will apply and it will give the victim the power to plead with the magistrate to seek alimony for himself and minor children
 -peedit mahila magistrate se naaballig bacchon ke sangrakshan kaa bhi anurodh kar sakati he
 The magistrate will take a final decision on the issue
 -prastaavit kanoon jammu-kashmir ko chhodkar puure desh main lagu hoga he

 He said that terrorism and extremism is a big challenge
 hamaare jameen par jo aatankwaad he wo pakistan dwaara pryojit he, hamaare madhya bharat main vampanthi ugravadi kshetron main vidroh he
 Rajiv Maharishi further said that the challenge of rebellion in the Northeast is very low, even in these extremist areas of left wing rebellions, their activities have declined

 congress ke varisht netaa rahe or purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ke rashtriya swayamsevak sangh mukhyalay nagpur jane ke baad se bijepi or sangh jahaan khush hai
 At the same time, it is considered a blow to Congress President Rahul Gandhi's anti-rss campaign
 rahul pichley kai saalon se aresas par lagaataar hamale kar rahe hai
 Are trying to create an atmosphere against the Union in the country
 yahi vajah he ki congress ke kai netaa pranab kaa sangh ke kaarykram main jane kaa virodh kar rahe the or unase na jane ke liye guzarish bhi kar rahe the
 However, now they are trying to explain it in their favor that Pranab went to the Sangh headquarters and gave advice to the Sangh
 gauratlab he ki purv raashtrapatipranab mukherjee sangh ke kaarykramame aise samay main shaamil hue, jab desh main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi piem modi or aresas virdohi shaktiyon ko ek manch par laane kii koshish main jute the
 In such a situation, Pranab's departure also went to the other secular parties of the opposition
 mana ja rahaa he ki pranab mukherjee ke is daanv ne rahul ke siyaasi vaicharik aadhaar ko hilaa kar rakh diya he
 Darussalrahul Gandhi has been active and aggressive against the Sangh since 2014
 rahul aresas ko mahatma gandhi kaa hatyara bataa chuke hai
 However, the Sangh challenged Rahul's statement in the court and hearing is going on
 congress adhyaksh apni chunavi reliyon or jansabhaon main sangh par sidhaa hamalaa bolte hai
 Rahul calls the Sangh an organization which divides the country, is anti-dalit and does not recognize the diversity of India
 party kii kaman apane haathon main lene ke baad rahul sangh ke khilaaf or bhi mukhar hue hai
 Rahul has been attacking Modi equally with the Sangh
 ve narendra modi ko bhi nafrat kii raajnneeti karne vaala or daliton, pichhadon or alpsankhyak virdohi qaraar dete hai
 They constantly insist that PM Modi has come from the Sangh and is trying to impose his ideology in the country
 sangh or modi desh kii bahulata kaa sammaan nahin karte hai
 Let me tell you that Modi was a RSS pracharak before joining politics
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ko lekar jis tarah sakht lakeer khinchakar apni raajnneetik bisaat bichaane main jute the
 In such a situation, Pranab Mukherjee going to the Sangh program and calling the RSS founder Hedgewar as the true son of India, is the same as 13 years ago when the then BJP President LK Advani offered flowers to Jinnah's tomb and called him secular
 Was
 pranab ne sangh ke kaarykram main desh kii vividhta or bahulata par jor diya or kaha ki bharat ek dharm or ek vichaar ko maanane vaala desh nahin he
 Our foundation is in tolerance and non-violence
 aresas ke kaarykram main pranab mukherjee ke jane se congress asahaj he
 This is also evident from the statements of party leaders
 congress netaa anand sharma ne kaha ki aresas ke mukhyalay main congress ke netaa rahe pranab da ko dekhakar congress ke lakhon kaaryakartaaon or bharat kii bahulata, vividhta or bhartiya ganraajya ke aadharbhoot mulyon main vishwaas karne vaale logon ko bahut dukh hua he
 Sharma further said that dialogue can only be with someone who believes in listening, understanding and changing
 aise kuch bhi prathit nahin ho rahaa he ki aresas apane agenda se hatane vaala he
 Its purpose is only to gain wide acceptance
 or pranab mukherjee ke nagpur daure se sangh ko samaaj main tathaa vibhinn rajyon main apni sweekaaryata badhaane main madad milegi
 The Sangh had earlier given examples such as Nehru's call in 1962 and Gandhi's praise
 aaj ke baad ab jab bhi sangh kii aalochanaayen congress ke log karenge to sangh ke paas pranab mukherjee kaa udhaaharan hoga ki ve sangh ke manch par aae or kaarykram ko sambodhit kiya

 Slogans play a very important role in winning elections
 yah sirf party kaaryakartaaon main josh hi nahin bharte balki janamanas ke main party ke paksh main maahaul banane main bhi bahut kargaar hote hai
 Two things are very important in India's elections, 1- Electoral slogans and 2- Electoral announcements
 partiyaan inke liye badi research karti hai
 The manifesto of all parties may be almost the same, but the slogans are completely different which is why slogans have more importance

 This was a relief news for the Congress which has been running at number four in the state for a long time
 saaf jaahir he ki chunaav purv congress ke liye yah safalataa naaron ne hi dilaai thi
 The slogans of the Congress were beginning to prevail on the people's tongue lagane laga tha ki chunaav streregist pike party ko sammanjanak sthiti main laa sakate hai
 The slogan of this election, which is maintained, is soft

 These slogans were hit in the last elections
 In the last Lok Sabha elections, BJP had launched an election campaign by making Narendra Modi the Prime Ministerial candidate and gave the slogan 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'
 yah naaraa na sirf hit hua balki endie ko prachand bahumat dilaane ke saath modi ko pradhanmantri bhi bana gaya
 In the 2007 assembly elections, the BSP supremo was a contender for the post of Chief Minister, the slogan was 'sarvajan Hitayi, Sarvajan Sukhay'
