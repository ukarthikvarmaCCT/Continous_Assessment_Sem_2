 mumbai main shuukravaar ko parel or elfinston railway stesan ke bich bane footover brij par bhagdad machane ke kaaran 22 logon kii maut ho gai he
 Now there is a big disclosure on this accident
 shivasena kii ore se do saansadon arvind saavant or rahul shivale ne 2015-16 main isi brij ko chaudaa karne ke liye chitthee likhi thi, jiske jawaab main tatkaaleen rail mantri suresh prabhu ne kaha tha ki railway ke paas iske liye fund nahin he
 He said that there is a slowdown in the global market, your complaint is correct but there is a shortage of funds right now
 haalanki sarkaar kaa kahana he ki saansadon kii baat tatkaal maan lee gai thi
 Government cleaning - New bridges have been approved; The Central Government clarified that the construction for the new footover bridge was approved in 2015 itself and the tender process for this is still underway
 tatkaaleen rail mantri suresh prabhu ne hi footover brij ke nirmaan kii manjuuri di he
 Suresh Prabhu to build the bridge 11
 86 karod rupee manjuur kiye hai
 The new bridge will be 12 meters wide
 saansadon ke patr ke baad suresh prabhu ne hi 2015 main iske liye baithak bulaai thi or ise 2016-17 ke rail bajet main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant also wrote a letter to Sadanand Gowda, the first railway minister of the NDA government in 2014 for this
 lekin tatkaaleen mantri ne bhi is par koi dhyaan nahin diya
 Shiv Sena MP Rahul Shivale wrote a letter to Suresh Prabhu on 23 April 2015 demanding widening of the foot overbridge
 iske alaava anya shivasena saansad arvind saavant ne bhi farvari 2016 main prabhu ko chitthee likhakar maang ko doharaaya tha
 During that time, Suresh Prabhu had cited the lack of funds and the global recession, saying that your demand is justified but as of now there is no fund, hence cannot be helped
 patr likhane vaale saansad rahul shivale ne ajtak se kaha ki is mudde ko lekar unhone tatkaaleen railmantri se lekar sansad tak main mudda uthaaya tha
 But no one had shown seriousness on this issue
 aaj kaa ye haadasa railway kii laaparvaahee kaa hi nateeja he
 Let us know that about 10 in the morning on Friday
 30 baje mumbai main parel or elfinston railway stesan ke footover brij par bhagdad ke kaaran 22 logon kii maut ho gai he
 More than 35 people have been injured in this incident
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki barish ke kaaran over brij par phislan thi, railing kaa hissaa tuutane se haadasa hua

 There is also talk of separatists being behind the killing of DSP
 aise main ab sawaal yah uthta he ki aakhir ghati main shanti bahaali kaise hogi? sarkaar or surakshabalon ko kisi ranneeti apnaani chahie? ghati par lagaataar najar rakhane vaale visheshgyon kii maane, to kuch khaas kadam uthaakar jammu evam kashmir main halaat sudhaare ja sakate hai
 
 
 
 1
 The most separatist leaders are responsible for disturbing the atmosphere in separatists in Baghatti
 soobe main band se lekar virodh pradarshan tak kaa aahvaan algaavvaadi netaa hi karte hai
 Apart from this, it is also their hand behind the instigation of the stone-pelters
 suraksha balon par hamalon or aatanki vaardaat main bhi algaavvaadiyon ke shaamil hone kii baat saamne aa chuki he
 They are also funded by Pakistan
 in sab ke baavjood sarkaar inako tavajjo detii he
 The government has also provided security to many separatist leaders
 agar in par puri tarah pratibandh laga diya jaae, to kuch had tak halaat kaabo karne main madad mil sakati he
 In addition, the security of the separatists should be abolished
 shanivaar ko kendriya mantri mukhtaar ne kaha ki aatankiyon or algaavvaadiyon main koi fark nahin
 2
 pakistan seemaa par boundry banakaris baat kopakistanbhalibhanti jaanata he ki vah bharat se sidhaa muqabla karke nahin jeet saktaa he
 Therefore, he is using terrorism against India
 pakistan kii ore se aatankiyon kii ghuspaith karai jaati he, jo ghati main hinsa kaa anjaam dete hai
 The government and security forces also believe that infiltration of terrorists from across the border is a big problem
 grahamantri rajnath singh bhi pakistan se satee seemaa par boundry banane kii baat kah chuke hai
 If it becomes a boundary, the infiltration of terrorists will stop
 saath hi seemaa paar se hone vaali aatanki funding or taskari par bhi lagaam kas jayega
 3
 soshal media par kadi nigaraane ke liye vishesh sibar sellpakistan, aatanki or algaavvaadi ghati main hinsa failaane ke liye soshal media kaa jabardast istemaal karte hai
 Despite the strictness and curfew of the security forces, the protesters gather
 ab sawaal yah uthta he ki aakhir itani jaldi ye pradarshnkaree ikattha kaise ho jate hai? khufia agenciyon kaa maananaa he ki aatanki or algaavvaadi whatrup group, fasebuk, twitor samet anya soshal media plateform kaa istemaal karke logon ko suraksha balon ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan karne ke liye uksaate hai
 Especially when terrorists surround the security forces, they make local people a barricade
 patharbaajon kii vajah se suraksha balon ko aatankiyon ke khilaaf abhiyaan main baadha aati he
 If a cyber cell is closely monitored on social media and action is taken immediately, it can be curbed to a great extent
 4
 Kashmiri Pandits will be settled in the valley
 The influence of militants and separatists has increased since the exodus of Kashmiri Hindus in Ghati
 aise main ghati main kashmiri hinduon ko phir se basaaya jaae, to aatankiyon or algaavvaadiyon ko hausale post ho jaaenge
 For this, the government will have to work hard
 kashmiri hinduon ko vishesh suraksha bhi muhaiyaa karaani padegi, lekin iske doorgaami parinaam honge or ghati main halaat jald sudhar jaaenge
 It is known that Kashmiri Hindus were persecuted in Jammu and Kashmir and they were forced to flee
 5
 The drone of the dreaded terrorists arriving at the funeral of the terrorists killed in the encounter with the security forces in Jammu and Kashmir, there has been a continuous increase in the incidents of firing of weapons in the funeral of the terrorists
 aatanki apane saathi ke maare jane ke baad uske janaaje main hathiyaar lekar pahunchate hai or yuvaaon ko jihad ke naam par bharat ke khilaaf uksaate hai
 However, it is difficult for the security forces to take action at that time, because terrorists can carry out any major incident by taking the cover of the mob
 aise main drone ke jariye janaaje main jutane vaale aatankiyon kii aasaani se pahchaan kii ja sakati he or unki gatividhiyon par najar rakhi ja sakati he
 After this, action can be taken easily against them
 6
 Special military operations against terrorists are conducted from time to time by the security forces and operations are carried out against the terrorists
 isse aatankiyon main khauf bhi he
 However, despite this, the terrorists are not deterring their antics
 suraksha agenciyon kii chaukasee ke chalate pakistan or aatanki sanghathan lagaataar apni ranneetiyon ko badal rahe hai
 In such a situation, the security forces do not get success in the campaign against the terrorists and they flee to the villagers
 aise main suraksha balon ko aatankiyon ke khilaaf vishesh abhiyaan chalaanaa chahie
 Apart from this, a new battalion of security forces should be formed, which can act with terrorists and create a good rapport with the villagers
 isse aatankiyon ko graminon se kisi tarah kii raahat nahin milegi
 7
 rojgaar or vikaas kii dhara se joda jaejammu evam kashmir main rojgaar or vikaas bhi badi samasya bane hue hai
 On not getting employment, the Kashmiri youth kneels before the separatists
 iske baad algaavvaadi or pakistani aatanki inako paisa dekar suraksha balon par patharbaji or hamalaa karne ke liye uksaate hai
 These youth facing unemployment are forced to go on this path
 iske alaava ghati main vikaas kaa bhi tota padaa he
 Terrorists and separatists take advantage of it and execute their plans
 agar ilaake ko vikaas kii dhara se jod diya jaae, to hinsak ghatnaon ko rokane main madad mil sakati he
 Apart from this, Dharma Gurus can also play an important role in getting misguided youth in the right path

 Organizations in industries like housing construction, auto, cotton, tea are in a restless state
 unki sud lene ke liye zyaadaatar akhbaar or tivi channel bilkul taiyaar nahin
 Due to the disappearance of the news, they have been forced to tell their poor thing through advertisements, but the issue of the financial condition of the country is not just theirs
 mali haalat se hi berojgaare kii samasya judi he
 The happiness and sorrow of all the citizens of the country is related to the economy of the country itself

 ) vaishno devi mandir ke liye nayaa motor trek banane ke virodh main katra ke dukandaaron, ghode waalon, palki waalon, pitthuon aadi ne guuruuvaar ko baari virodh kiya
 Police had to lathi-charge to overcome the protesters near Banganga
 takaraav main do pulicekarmiyon samet 5 log ghayal ho gaye
 The police have arrested three local business circles leaders
 is bich, vaishno devi yatra jari he
 Heavy police arrangements have been made to ensure no inconvenience to the devotees
 darasal, shri mata vaishno shrin board kii ore se katra ke paas baalani chowk checkpost se nae trek kaa nirmaan karaayaa ja rahaa he
 This track will go to semi-virgin
 is tarah katra se vaishno devi darbar tak puure maarg ko hi vaahan se tay kiya ja sakegaa
 This track is fiercely opposed by Katra shopkeepers, horsemen, Pithas
 unka kahana he ki ye trek shuru ho gaya to banganga aurcharanpaduka mandirke aasapaas jitne dukandaar hai unki roji-roti chhin jaaegi
 All of these jobs are run by devotees only
 inkaa kahana he ki isse chaar lakh log berozegaar ho jaaenge
 On the other hand, Srimata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board says that the new track will be used only for VIP movement, movement of board goods
 lekin katra ke dukandaaron kaa kahana he ki ek baar nayaa baan ganga-tarakot-ardhkunwaari maarg trek shuru ho gaya to phir ise shraddhaluon ke liye bhi khol diya jayega
 They say that with the opening of the new route, if devotees go to Darshan by this route, then the work of the shopkeepers located on the traditional route will be affected
 iske alaava ghode waalon kaa bhi rojgaar chhinega kyonki nae trek par unhen jane kii ijaajat nahin hogi
 If you remember, after assuming power at the Center in 2014, the newly arrived in the power corridors of Delhi, Narendra Modi caught everyone's attention with his different working style
 piem banane ke baad modi ne sidhe har vibhaag ke sachiv ko talab kiya or bharose main lekar kaam main jute jane kaa mantra de diya
 Now there is Yogi Raj in UP and CM Adityanath is seen moving on this path
 sachivalay main dikhi bhaagambhagsomvaar ko lakhanu sachivalay main bhaagambhag dekhne laayak tha
 Top officers of all departments were summoned by CM Yogi and they were required to present a blue print of the functioning of their respective departments
 siem yogi ne adhikariyon ke saath 8 ghante tak marathon meeting kii or is dauraan tamaam adhikari apane-apane vibhaagon kii ore aate-jate dikhe
 In CM called for files related to all decisions and projects and looked at each point
 adhikariyon ke target set kiye gaye or vyaktigat taur par javabdehi tay kii gai
 People are calling it the Modi style of governance
 8 ghante kii meeting main kya hua?somvaar ko siem yogi kii meeting ke liye sarkari baabuon ko khub mashkkat kerani padi
 In the capital Lucknow, the officials' meeting continued till late night on Monday with CM Adityanath Yogi and his cabinet ministers, where CM Yogi discussed the road map ahead with secretaries of all departments taking news of everything
 vahiin yogi sarkaar ne 5 saal main 10 lakh nae rojgaar paidaa karne kaa lakshya rakhaa
 If sources are to be believed, the meeting with the Education Department reviewed the existing education system of the state
 iske saath hi nijee skulon kii fees ghataane ko lekar bhi nirdesh die gaye
 According to Ajay Kumar, Secretary, Basic Education Department, all these instructions have to be implemented in the next 100 days
 100 din kaa kya he rodmap?siem yogi ne sabhi vibhaagon se 100 dinon kaa rodmap banane or us par turant amal shuru karne ko kaha he
 After these 100 days, the work report will also be summoned from all the officers and the officers have also been warned of stern action if found guilty
 vahiin in 100 dinon ke sarkaar kaa aglaa lakshya 6 maheene or phir 1 saal ke liye rodmap banane or usapar amal kaa hoga
 Here, Yogi's purpose of completing the work is clearly visible while deciding the responsibility
 tabadale kii jagah kamyupi main bijepi kii prachand jeet ke saath satta main aane ke baad yogi sarkaar ke 16 din puure ho gaye hai
 In the action mode, the Yogis are making quick decisions but according to the general practice in these 16 days, there was no haste about the transfer of officers
 iske ulat pichhali sarkaar main tainaat adhikariyon ke saath hi yogi apane kaam ko dhar dene main lage hue hai
 There is speculation here that after all, is Yogi's plan for UP bureaucracy? Looking at the way of working for CM Yogi's 15 days, there are mainly 5 things that Yogi wants to employ bureaucracy using as masterstroke
 jaahir he siem yogi ke is nae gavarnence system se adhikariyon ke saamne dodhari talwaar vaali sthiti he
 1
 sidhe janata se judakar system kaa dar kaayam karnaprachand bahumat ke saath satta main ai yogi sarkaar ne kaam karne ke nae andaaj ko apanaaya he
 CM Yogi himself is making direct contact with officers of all departments
 darasal ye sarkaar chalaane kaa modi style he
 Amidst the frequent complaints of cheating in the examinations, CM Yogi took direct action against the examination managers of 111 centers, while in Lucknow, he created a control room to deal with complaints
 ek whatsap number jari kar logon se nakal kii sidhi shikaayat karne ko kaha gaya or elaan kiya gaya ki 3 ghante ke bheetar karrwai hogi
 In this way of running the government, people are connecting with the government themselves and this is the fear of the people who make a mess
 2
 Instead of transferring the old officers to focus on the shortcomings in the schemes, CM Yogi has adopted a new way of working by handing over the reins of departments in his hands
 pichley dinon siem yogi ne gomti riverfrant pariyojna ke rivyuu ke liye vahiin jaakar meeting kii or adhikariyon se jawaab talab kiya
 An investigation into the malfunctions in the project was initiated and a work order was issued immediately
 3
 If the CM Yogi himself is touring to streamline the new rules system for discipline, officers have also been issued a decree to work among the public
 satta sanbhaalane ke agle din siem yogi hajratganj thane pahunche or vahaan adhikariyon kii tainaati or saaf-safai kaa jayja liya
 After this Yogi also visited the hospital
 siem ne daftaron main gutkha-tambaakoo khaane par saaf roak laga di saath hi farmaan jari kiya ki sarkari daftaron main shikaayat yaa kaam lekar aane vaale logon kii sunwaayee ho or adhikari-karmchaaree thik se vyavhaar karne ke alaava logon kii shikayaton par jald karrwai karen
 4
 janata ke bich afasaron ko bhejne kii tarkibasiem yogi jahaan lagaataar vibhinn daftaron or pariyojnaon kaa daura kar rahe hai vahiin adhikariyon ko bhi janata ke bich jaakar kaam karne ko kaha he
 CM Yogi ordered the officers to walk one hour daily to realize the presence among the public, and also arranged for the complaints to be sent directly to them through the helplines
 isse adhikariyon par kaam karne kaa dabaav badha he
 5
 paardarshita ke jariye bhrashtachar par lagaamsatta sambhalate hi siem yogi ne elaan kar diya ki afasar 15 din main apni sampatti kii jaankaree saarvajanik karen
 Apart from this, through constant meetings with the officials, Yogi gave the message that he has an eye on every department
 apane tamaam mantriyon ko bhi yogi ne sandesh diya ki saaf-suthri chhavi or eemaandaar becoground vaale adhikariyon ko hi apane saath mantralay main rakhen
 Talking to reporters outside Parliament, he said, 'people love Salman a lot
 isliye agar vah brands ambeseder hai to isamen kya dikkat he

 His popularity should be used for a good cause

 kya shivasena asurakshit mahasoos kar rahi he? kya use bharosa nahin he bijepi par? kya is vajah se nahin he, kyonki endie nahin he
 It is for the name, but the structure that was made during Vajpayee, whose chairman could be from even smaller allies, is not like NDA
 shivasena bijepi kaa vivaad kisi kaaman forum par nahin suljhaayaa ja rahaa he
 In Pune, Amit Shah's meeting raised the slogan that Chhatrapati Shivaji's blessings, let's go with Modi
 times of india main bijepi ke netaa kaa bayaan he ki uske manchon par shivaji kii tasviir hogi
 BJP workers will also chant the slogan of Jai shivaji-jai Bhavani
 to kya bijepi bhi sena ko uksaa rahi he? In The Hindu, Priyanka Kakodkar has written that this time when Amit Shah went to Mumbai and did not go to Matoshree, Shiv Sena workers started sharing old photographs of how Modi bowed his head in front of Bala Saheb Thackeray
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad bijepi ne shivasena ko kendriya mantrimandal main khaas mahatv nahin diya
 Till the swearing-in, Shiv Sena's potential ministers were doing nothing
 shivasena ne bhi do baar upie ke raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ko samarthan dekar bijepi ke saamne big brother kaa role play kiya tha
 Not of elder sister
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle shivasena sushamaa swaraj kii kaafii vakaalat kiya karti thi
 Sanjay Raut's statement was that Balasaheb Thackeray considered Sushma Swaraj suitable for the post of Prime Minister and his words are the last for us
 karnataka vidhansabha main haarane ke baad saamana ne kaha tha ki bijepi ke super star modi ne jahaan-jahaan prachaar kiya, vahiin bijepi haar gai
 Whether this statement is seen in the past of such statements or the desire of BJP
 agar yah gathbandhan tutaa to kya raajnneeti ke chaatr hindutv ke do daavedaaron ke bich koi teevr raajnneetik sangharsh dekhenge
 After the Karnataka assembly elections, Saamana wrote that the Bharatiya Janata Party should not wear the hat of Hindutva and put the cap of secularism on its head
 agar aisa kiya to congress or bijepi main fark kya? modi ko gujarat main vot milte hai to kattar hindutv kii vajah se

 to aisa nahin he ki bijepi ne nahin saha he
 May be all are waiting for the end of the ancestors
 bhartiya raajnneeti kaa yah bhi ek mahatvapurn paksh he
 Sharad Pawar will go with Shiv Sena after the election or is it a different side with BJP
 philhal congress ensipi ke kaaryakartaaon ke naa chaahane ke baavjood congress ensipi ek saath ladate hue nazar aa rahe hai
 Pawar and his party have started taking a separate line from Congress or UPA in Parliament
 jis tarah se do hindutv dal alag-alag naam se ho usee tarah kaa sankat yahaan bhi hai
 The two Congress are by different names
 ensipi netaa ajit pavaar kah chuke hai ki ve prithviraj chouhan ke netritv main ab or kaam nahin karnaa chahenge
 The Congress has made Chauhan the leader
 prithviraj chouhan ne bhi kaha he ki ham sabhi siton par vichaar kar rahe hai, agar gathbandhan nahin ban sakaa to
 Congress has said that wait for two days
 is bich manase ke raaj thakare akele hai
 For example, the army was annoyed at Gadkari's meeting with him before the Lok Sabha elections
 jaise 2012 main narendra modi ne unhen mukhyamantri pad ke shapath grahan ke dauraan ahmadahbaad bulaayaa tha
 No one is talking with them at the moment
 isliye maharashtra kaa chunaav rashtriya ho gaya he
 If the alliance is broken, the election of Maharashtra will directly become a litmus test for Narendra Modi and Amit Shah
 upi or bihar vidhansabha ke chunaavon ne dhokhaa nahin diya hota to ab tak bijepi faisla kar chuki hoti
 Not everyone has stopped because of Pitrupaksha
 maharashtra kaa chunaav chautarafa hua to kise laabh hoga? upi main to bijepi ko hua tha
 73 seats were found, but in Maharashtra

 The film is being criticized in the Feminists' groups that Kabir Singh's attitude towards his girlfriend is highly regressive and with the help of this character, women are trying to promote malicious thinking
 ye bhi aarope lag rahe hai ki kabir singh jaise bihaviour ko pramot karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he or uske gussell, regrassive mindset ko sirf isliye ignor kar diya jaataa he kyonki wo ek topper he
 The film has proved to be a box office hit, although it remains a topic of discussion among many social groups
 soshal media par aaj ke daur main is tarah ke vyavhaar par mahilaayein bhale virodh darj kara rahi hon lekin india today data intelegence unit ne paaya he ki purushon se zyada mahilaayein hi kabir singh jaise kirdaaron ko real life main jaij tehraati hai
 According to data from the 2015-16 National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), 51 percent of women in the 15-49 age group feel that it is appropriate for a husband to beat his wife for seven reasons
 vahiin 42 pratishat purush patni ke khilaaf hinsa ko jaij tehraate hai
 According to data from the National Family Health Survey, the statistics of women justifying violence from their husbands has not improved much since 2005-06
 survey main paaya gaya ki 2005-06 main 54 pratishat mahilaon ne pati dwaara apni patniyon ke saath hinsa ko jaij mana tha jo 2015-16 main ghatakar 51 pratishat ho gaya he
 In contrast, there has been a 9 percent drop in the number of men who justify violence against their wife
 jabaki 2005-06 main, kuch 51 pratishat purushon ne mana ki apni patni ko peetna sahi he, 10 saal baad yah sankhya ghatakar 42 pratishat rah gai
 After all, why do they think that the husband's violence is justified? These seven reasons in which the wife is justified in the beating are - disrespecting the mother-in-law, husband suspecting infidelity on wife, not cooking food, husband's Reasons include arguing together, leaving the house without telling the husband, not taking care of the children or the home, and refusing to have a physical relationship with the husband
 in saat vajahon main sabase bada kaaran saas-sasur ke prati anadar dikhaanaa mana gaya he
 Many women and men have justified violence against wives
 jahaan 37 pratishat mahilaayein maanati hai ki saas sasur kaa anadar karne par pati kaa patni ko peetna sahi he vahi 29 pratishat mardon ne gharavaalon kii beijjati karne par patni ko peetna sahi mana he
 The second biggest reason for violence against wife in this survey is neglect of home or not taking care of children
 33 pratishat mahilaayein aisi thim jinhone mana ki ghar-parivaar or bacchon kii dekhbhaal naa karne par patniyon ko peetna thik he vahi is maamle main keval 20 pratishat purushon ne patni ke khilaaf hinsa ko sahi tehraaya he
 Doubting the wife, going home and arguing without telling the husband were also some of the reasons that women and men have been vindicated for domestic violence with the wife
 pati ke saath shaareerik sambandh se manaa karne par mahila hinsa kii hakdaar ho jaati he ? is maamle main zyaadaatar purushon or mahilaon ne gharelu hinsa ko galat bataaya he
 In the case of men, this number goes into the negative
 9 pratishat purushon ne mana ki aise cese main mahila ke saath gharelu hinsa honi chahie vahi 13 pratishat maanati hai ki patniyaan agar pati ke saath sambandh banane se manaa karti hai to ve hinsa kii hakdaar he
 For what reason do men beat their wives? - The more drunk husband, the more violence against the wife, the more alcohol the wife has to face violence
 kabir singh kaa kirdaar ek sharaabi he lekin wo sharaab pine ke baad apni patni ko nahin martha he
 However, the situation of most women in India is not so good
 sharaab pine or gharelu hinsa main bhi kaaphi kareebi sambandh dekhne ko mila he
 Only 22 per cent of the women were those whose husbands do not drink alcohol but still have suffered domestic violence
 pati ke sharaab pine kii aadat ke hisaab se gharelu hinsa main kami yaa badhotaree dekhne ko milti he
 77 percent of the women are those who have suffered domestic violence and the husbands of these women often drink alcohol
 - kam padhi likhi, kam behatar aarthik sthiti kii mahilaon ke saath gharelu hinsa kii sambhaavna hoti he zyaadaeneechaes -4 kii report saaf karti he ki mahila kaa soshal stats jitna behatar he uske saath gharelu hinsa kii sambhaavna utani hi kam hoti he
 Educated and economically affluent women suffer less domestic violence than less educated and poor women
 jin mahilaon ne barahavin tak kii padhai kii hai, aisi 18-19 pratishat mahilaon ko gharelu hinsa kaa saamana karnaa padaa he vahiin apane jivan main kabhi skool naa jane vaali 41
 3 percent of the women have experienced domestic violence, be it physical violence, mental, sexual or emotional violence
 pati se darati-ghabraati mahilaon or gharelu hinsa kaa bhi kaaphi gaharaa sambandh he
 According to this survey, women who are extremely afraid of their husbands are 58 percent more likely to have domestic violence, whereas women who have never feared beating their husbands, 32 percent of women with domestic violence There is a possibility of patniyon ke rojgaar kaa muddis survey main saamne aayaa ki patniyon kii naukariyon se bahut zyada purush khush nahin hote hai or naukari pesha mahilaon ko anpadh mahilaon ke mukaable gharelu hinsa jhelane kii sambhaavna zyada hoti he
 According to the results of the survey, 39 percent of the occupation women are more likely to face domestic violence, while for illiterate women this figure is 26 percent

 Dharmendra Pradhan, Petroleum and Natural Gas (minister of State, Independent Charge), is a virtually unknown face within the most controversial ministry in the last two decades
 inhen vah kaam diya gaya jo upie main virappa moili, jaipal reddy, murali devda or manishankar ayyar ke jimme tha
 This was done because they were confident that they would not be corrupt

 UP STF reached Kanpur on Monday morning and during the investigation of the Rs 3700 crore online scam, the team sealed the house of Ayushy Mittal, wife of Anubhav

 On Sunday, hundreds of people demonstrated in Delhi for Anubhav Mittal's release
 mahaj 26 saal kii umr main is shaks ne 3700 karod rupee kaa ghotaalaa kar sabhi ko chaunkaa diya
 Anubhav Mittal's next step was to beat Facebook
 darasal you-tub par anubhav kii company dwaara 27 janvari ko ek video daalaa gaya tha
 In this video, it has been claimed that the company will soon launch India's social networking platform on the lines of Facebook
 iske saath hi company kii kol centre or i-commers vyavsaay main bhi utarane kii yojana thi
 Experience was named social commerce to e-commerce
 anubhav kaa daawa tha ki vah soshal trade ke niveshkon ko badi companiyon ke mahange utpaada kaaphi kam keemat par uplabdh karaayega
 For this, he had also claimed to have tied up with his investors with several well-known companies
 soshal netwarking plateform or i-commers ke liye anubhav ne lagbhag sabhi taiyaariyaan puri kar lee thim
 They were to be launched this month through a major program
 anubhav kii maane to uskaa soshal netwarking plateform fasebuk se bhi bada or majboot hoga, kyonki fasebuk ke paas vaastavik audiyans nahin he, jabaki uske soshal media kii audiyans vaastavik hogi
 Used to emotionally blackmail people, let us know that the experience had presented it to investors by connecting it with Digital India program
 anubhav ke tej dimag kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki vah bhaavnaatmak rup se apane har nirnay ko desh hit, desh kii tarakkee se jodakar or niveshkon ke hiton se jodakar dikhalaataa tha
 Due to this, he had added more than 6 lakh people with him in no time

 Bollywood was getting stars by giving crores Promotions Despite the company being in loss, Anubhav was organizing events by giving crores of rupees to Bollywood stars to promote social trade
 anubhav hameshaa niveshkon ko fansaane ke liye nayaa idia laata tha
 His aim was to connect more people with social trade and make money from them
 khulaasa hua he ki anubhav farvari se apane thagi ke dhandhe ko kaaphi vistaar dene ja rahaa tha
 400 people were going to visit Australia despite the loss, UP STFK DSP Rajkumar Mishra said about the investigation of the case
 company or anubhav ke paas se baraamad dastavejon kii padtaal kii ja rahi he
 He said, if a company is running in losses, how was it planning to take the investors of its 400 Diamond Club to Australia
 dspi mishra ke anusaar unhen mail par bhi anubhav ke khilaaf saboot or shikaayatein mil rahi hai
 Now from where the money will be returned to the people, it is worth mentioning that a woman who reached out of the Noida Sector-63 company in support of the experience claimed that she had connected more than a thousand housewives to the company
 vahiin bulandshahr ke ek shaks ne daawa kiya ki usne takreeban 10 hajaar logon ko soshal trade dot bij kaa sadsy banaaya tha
 Now the problem in front of them is that the members created by them are now demanding their money back from them

 kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu ke bayaan par dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne patwaar kiya he
 Venkaiah Naidu called Karbafi a fashion
 kejariwal ne kaha he ki kisaanon kii karjamaafee ko fishan kaise mana ja saktaa he? desh kaa kisaan mushkil daur se guzar rahaa he or karjamaafee se use madad milti he
 Reacting to Naidu's statement, Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal said that news of farmers' plight is coming across the country
 ye desh ke kisaan kii sachai bataati he
 They are not in a position to return the loan taken for farming
 aise main sarkaar kaa ferj banataa he ki karj maaf karke kisaanon ko raahat de
 Kejriwal also took a dig at Naidu's statement on the central government and said that there is a debt of 36 thousand crores on the farmers of Uttar Pradesh alone
 ise maaf karnaa chahie lekin aisa nahin ho rahaa he
 While thousands of crores of big people were loaned
 kejariwal ne ishaaron ishaaron main hi vijay maalya ke karj kaa kaa bhi hawala diya or kaha ki karj maafee ko fishan bataanaa saraasar galat he
 This is the need of the farmers
 gauratlab he ki kendriya shahari vikaas mantrivenkaiya naidune apane ek bayaan main kaha tha ki kisaanon kaa karj maafee ab desh main ek fishan sa ban gaya he
 This should be in a very difficult situation, but now the state governments are engaged in waiving the debt of the farmers
 adhitar log personal finance ke bare main suniyojit ravaiya nahin rakhte
 They invest the money that is left over from their expenses, and not make a separate plan for investment
 yaa phir vibhinn yojanaon main paisa laga dete hai, na ki kisi aisi yojana main jo unki jaruraton ke hisaab se upyukt ho
 The result is that they are unable to meet the needs of life
 vittiya yojana aapako bhavishya kaa lakshya puraa karne main madadgaar sabit hoti he
 To start this journey, you should keep these things in mind
 vittiya sthiti janenvitiya yojana banane ke liye bajet kii ruparekha taiyaar karnaa pehla kadam he
 This gives you accurate information about your financial situation
 bajet banane ke liye sabase pehle aap apane sroton jaise vetan, kiraaya, yaa byaaj aadi se hone vaali aay kii suchi bana len
 After this, calculate all your expenses which include payment of insurance, school fees of children, etc
 ye kharch avadhi ke hisaab se thode alag-alag ho sakate hai par inkaa yoga banaakar inhen pratimah ke anusaar baant len
 This will know how much money you have remaining for investment
 giojit financial services main nivesh paraamarsh ke pramukh jivan kumaar kehete hai, ''yah taiyaari nahin karenge to aapaki yojana main bajet ko lekar samasya aa sakati he
 "keep in mind the risk
 While making a financial plan, it is also important to keep in mind that there may also be accidental problems in life, such as loss of job or sudden expense of some major illness
 isaki taiyaari pehle kar lene se aapako apni bachat kaa paisa nikaalane yaa kisi se udhaar lene kii jarurat nahin padegi
 First of all, make a contingency fund so that you can bear your expenses for 3-6 months
 is paise ko kisi liquid fund main rakh sakate hai
 You can also keep this money in a short-term fixed deposit in which money is required (rs 50,000)
 yaa nivesh kaa 90 pratishat, jo apekshaakrit kam ho) nikaalane kii suvidha ho
 Tax on medium-term (above three years) bank fds also benefits
 iske baad aapako apane or apane parivaar ke liye medical kaa beemaa bhi kara lenaa chahie
 According to the general rule, your medical insurance should be 10 times your monthly income, which can be up to 20 times
 parivaar ke sadasyon ke liye vyaktigat health beemaa policy ke mukaable aisi policy leni chahie jisamen puure parivaar ke logon kaa beemaa ho
 It is cheap
 aap top-ap plan bhi le sakate hai
 Along with this you should also get a good life insurance policy
 pyor turm plan sabase achche or saste hote hai kyonki ye kam kharch par zyada jivan beemaa uplabdh karaate hai
 Determine the economic value of your goal
 It is very important that you determine the economic value of your goal, so that you can decide how much money you need to save
 isamen mahangaai ko bhi dhyaan main rakhen
 Jeevan Kumar says, "you should calculate the rate of inflation very carefully because even a small reduction in the calculation in the long term can make a big difference
 ''aapako vibhinn uddeshyon ke liye alag-alag portpholio bananaa chahie
 With the help of Rule of 72, you can set your target amount
 72 kii sankchaya ko mahangaai kii anumaanit dar (maan lijie 6 pratishat) se vibhajit karen to aapako utane varshon (is maamle main 12) kaa pataa chal jayega jitne varshon main keemten dugani ho jaaengi
 Determine risk-taking ability Knowing risk-taking helps you determine the debt-equity ratio
 equity ke liye aap kitna jokhim uthaa sakate hai, isaki gananaa ke liye ek saamaanya niyam haih 100 main se apni umr gata den
 In this way, if you are 30 years old, then 70 percent of your portfolio should be in equity
 rin main bank epady, choti bachat yojanaayen or rin saajha kosh jaise vikalp shaamil hai
 To invest your money in equity, you can choose to invest in shares or equity mutual funds
 choti avadhi ke lakshyon ke liye utaar-chadhaav vaale sroton jaise ki share bazaar main nivesh karnaa thik nahin he
 But keeping in mind long-term goals such as retirement, you can invest more money in equities because they benefit more in the long term
 equity main zyada paisa lagaana aapke portpholio ko jokhim bharaa bana saktaa he, haalanki rin vaali yojanaon main apekshaakrit kam laabh miltaa he
 Therefore you need to adopt the right mixture of both
 nivesh par vaanchit dalpane rin-equity anupaat par nirbhar karte hue aap apane nivesh par laabh kii anumaanit dar kaa hisaab laga sakate hai
 The more you invest in equity, the higher your rate of profit is likely to be
 lakshyon ke mulya, avadhi or nivesh par anumaanit laabh kii dar ke aadhaar par aap yah gananaa kar sakate hai ki aapako prati maah kitna nivesh karne kii jarurat he, vah raashi jo aapaki aay badaae ke saath badhaai bhi ja sakati he
 If you cannot invest that much amount, then reconsider the budget and cut down on unnecessary expenses
 tex main bachatajyaadaatar log tex bachaane vaale saajha koshon yaa endoment yojanaon main nivesh karte hai or sochate hai ki unhone tex bachaane kaa kaam puraa kar liya he
 Tarun Birani, founder and CEO of TBNG Capital Advisors, says, "if you plan your investments in different ways, you can save tax from your investments
 ''sahi yojana kaa chunaav bahut ahm he
 You should consider the lock-in period, tax on maturity, etc
 along with the benefits you get while doing so
 jivan or swasthya beemaa ke premiyamon par aapako tex menchhut milti he
 Similarly in ELSS and ULIP, you can also invest in equity
 paanch saal ke epady or pipief bhi kramshah madhyam or deergh avadhi main itnaa hi phydemand hote hai

 When it comes to protecting oneself from skin cancer, it is important to have some fear in mind
 shodhakartaaon kaa kahana he ki twachaa cancer ke dar or chintaa se grast log is beemaari ke utpann hone kii vajahon ko jaanane or saavdhaanee baratane ke bajaay twachaa par sanscrine lagane kaa vikalp chunate hai
 "the research revealed that physicians want to keep the patient's emotions in mind while encouraging people to use Sunscreen," said Mark Kiviniemi, assistant professor at the University of Buffalo in the US
 shodh ke tahat kareeb 1,500 logon se unke sanscrine istemaal se sambandhit prashn puche gaye
 These people did not personally experience skin cancer
 pratibhaagiyon se twachaa cancer ke khatre kaa anumaan lagane or is bare main unki chintaa se sambandhit prashn puche gaye
 Of the total participants, 32 percent said that they never use sunscreen while 14 percent replied that they always use sunscreen
 har maamle main yah dekha gaya ki twachaa cancer ko lekar logon kii chintaa is bare main jaankariyaan hasil karne kii ichha ke bajaay sidhe unke vyavhaar ko prabhavit karti he or logon kii chintaa badhane ke saath saath sanscrine kaa istemaal bhi badhata he
 "this research is important because most of what we do in the field of public health communication focuses on the expansion of information and information," said Kiviniemi
 " unhone kaha, "apni bhaawanaaon ko kaabo na karke ham vyavhaar ke prabhaav ko kho dete hai
 "this research has been published in the journal Behavioral Medicine
 shukriya un sabhi kaa jinhone bharat mata kii jai bolne ke vivaad ko phir se tool diya
 The same dispute was once about Vande Mataram and has been happening and Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 vande maataram or bharat mata kii vikaas yatra main kai varshon kaa antar he magar kab donon ek-duusare ke poorak ho jate hai yah thik thik bataanaa mushkil he
 These controversies make us believe that there is no need to panic
 ham kahin gaye nahin hai, vahiin hai
 The politics of India has faced this controversy before and will face it whenever it happens
 bharat mata kii jai bolne main na to samasya he na nahin bolne main
 The problem is who are you to say that Bharat Mata ki Jai should speak or why this is the ultimate proof of being a patriot
 baharhaal bahes ho rahi he
 Some people of this camp are winning some arguments, some people of that camp are winning
 referi pareshaan he ki jaldi match taai ho jaae, ki ghar bhaage
 It is true that Bharat is a mother, but is it also true that Bharat was always a mother
 hamane kab pehle pahal bharat mata ko dekha tha jis rup main aaj dekhte hai
 You will see pictures of Bharat Mata found in the shop of calendar posters of Old Delhi
 pataa chalegaa ki bharat mata ke swaroop kii kitni vividhta he
 Many research students have deeply studied the development journey of Mother Goddess to Goddess in these calendars and posters
 jyotindra jain, mrinalini sinha, geeti sen or sadan jha jaise kai log in tasveeron ke jariye rashtrawaad, uske tamaam pahalu kaa adhyayan karte hai
 Sumati Ramaswamy has also written a book THE GODESS AND THE NATION, MAPPING MOTHER INDIA
 jubaan kii prakaashak urvashi butalia ne is kitaab kii tasveeron or jaankaree ke istemaal kii ijazat de di he
 We do not claim to have said the last thing, but this is an attempt to understand the development journey of Mother India through this dispute
 kya hamaari bharat mata shuru se waisi hi dikhti he jaisi aaj dikhti hai
 Mother Bharat changes in every picture
 hamaari koshish bas itani he, aapako itihaas kii yatra par le chalem or vahaan se lautakar kuch or baat karen
 Certain things will remain incomplete and there will be something that you would like to add, but apologies for this
 puraanon main janmabhumi se lekar jagat ke swaroop ko bayaan karne vaale tamaam shloke milenge
 Is the same map of the country as we see today? kabhi sochiega gar nakshaa or globe na ho to aap kisi bhi mulk kii kalpana kaise karenge
 How would people imagine their country before them
 desh ke daayre main to gaanv bhi tha or rajya bhi
 Going from one village to another became known as Pardes
 vinoba bhaave ne ek baar chutki lete hue kahin kaha tha ki ek shabd he raashtra
 The next word is Maharashtra and the third word is hundred nations
 to hamaare raashtra main ek se lekar sau raashtra vaale naam ke rajya se lekar kshetra maujuud hai
 There is a dispute about speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai, one mother of this nation
 abanindranath tagaur kii kalpanashiltaa se bani hamaari pehali bharat mata
 Through photographs, people had seen this Mother India for the first time
 1905 main swadeshi andolan ke dauraan abanindranath tagaur kii kuchi se jab bharat mata kaa swaroop avatarit hua to desh kii azaadi kaa sapana dekh rahe logon kii kalpanaaon main aag lag gai
 When it first appeared in a magazine, it was titled Spirit of Mandar India
 abanindranath tagaur ne pehle inkaa naam bang mata rakhaa tha baad main bharat mata kar diya
 Think if Bharat Mata's development journey would have been like the first name Bang Mata
 us bengal main is tasviir se pehle aanandamath kii rachana ho chuki thi or vande maataram gaaya jane laga tha
 This Bharat Mata has four hands
 shiksha, diksha, ann or vastra hai inke haathon main
 In the films of independent India, this bread becomes cloth and house
 koi hathiyaar nahin he koi jhanda nahin he
 According to the known photographs, the first Bharat Mata is also a normal Bengali woman
 jaldi hi desh bhar main bharat mata kii anek tasviren banane lageen
 Revolutionary organizations started using photographs of Bharat Mata
 chhaapon ke dauraan bharat mata kii tasviir milte hi angreji hukumat chaukanni ho jaati thi
 Anushilan Samiti, Yugantar Party use photographs of Bharat Mata and Bharat Mata Society in Punjab, Bharat Mata Association in Madras comes into existence
 sab apni-apni bharat mata gadhane lagate hai lekin dhire-dhire tasveeron main bharat mata kaa rup kareeb-kareeb sthai hone lagata he
 Bharat Mata has two hands instead of four
 shuru main dhvaj dikhataa he phir trishul or talwaar dikhne lagata he
 The tricolor also appears in many photographs
 kisi main chakra nahin he to kisi main charkha he
 In some pictures, Sri Lanka also comes at the feet of Mother India
 to aaj agar aap puraani tasveeron ko dekhenge to vibhaajan se pehle kaa pakistan or afghanistan bhi nazar aayega
 Viewers saw Bharat Mata in Goddess Durga and Mother Durga in Mother India
 abanindranath tagaur kii bharat mata bengal kii hone ke kaaran na to sher ke saath hai na trishul ke saath
 The lion forms also look different in many photographs
 kahin sher gurraa rahaa he to kahin vijayi bhav se shant he
 In some pictures, the lion is also seen in a way that Bharat Mata is riding the mighty British rule
 unhen apane lagaam main le liya he
 Due to being a goddess, some people think that Bharat is mother but not everyone's mother
 darasal hamaari azaadi kii ladaai main kai aadhunik tatv hai magar swatantraaa andolan ateet ke hindustan ke saath chalata he
 Is not completely detached from its symbols
 is vajah se aapako rashtrawaad ke saath dharmik pratik dikhenge or dharmik vyakti rashtravaadi hone kaa daawa karte milenge
 By nationalist here i mean freedom fighter
 uttar or purab kii bharat mata kii tasviren to milti hai lekin dakshin main kya ho rahaa tha
 How does the imagination of Mother India reach there
 sumati ramasvami ne apni kitaab main ek tasviir pesh kii he
 20 April 1907
 bengal main abanindranath tagaur 1905 main bharat mata kii kalpana karte hai to sudur dakshin main mahakavi subrahmanyam bharti apane akhbaar ke mukhya prishth par bharat mata kii tasviir chhapate hai
 Intia is the name of the newspaper
 yah tasviir nae saal kii devi ke rup main chhapi he lekin unka ek haath globe par he
 Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians are seen, who are bowing
 tab to kisi ovaisi ko dikkat nahin hui ki ek devi ke calendar main ve kyon sheesh nava rahe hai
 Many pictures of Bharat Mata are Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian
 ek tasviir ko bharti ne kuch samay baad chapa tha
 The picture is printed in South India but in this picture of Mother India, Vande Mataram is written in Devanagari
 bharat mata ke charnon main hindu, muslim, sikh, isai hai, naav par khadey hai
 In this picture there is something written in Urdu in one hand of Bharat Mata
 yah likhaa hua he allaaho akbar
 This is the mother of all India, but is it possible in today's era? aksar log bharat mata kii tasviir main mata dekhne lag jate hai or mata main sirf devi durga
 Bharti only saw India in this picture
 isliye vahaan hindi main vandemataram he or urdu main allaaho akbar
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi often mentions Subrahmanyam Bharti
 modi sarkaar aane ke baad jab kai logon ke dak tikat ko band kar diya gaya tha magar bal gangadhar tilak, bismillah kaan or subrahmanyam bharti ke dak tikat ko niyamit karavaaya gaya tha
 In March 2015, Prime Minister Modi made a speech in the Parliament of Sri Lanka, read a few lines of Bharti's poem and said that Bharti was a great nationalist poet
 bharti pehle shaks hai jinke bare main zikr miltaa he ki unhone bharat mata kii tasviir se lekar murtiyon banane ke prayaas kiye
 Otherwise, very few people know who was the creator, who was the builder
 ek bada jabardast kissa miltaa he
 In 1911, Mahakavi attempts to make a statue of Bharat Mata made by Bharati Abanindranath
 murtikar kahata he ki is bharat ne kuch gahane hi nahin pahane hai
 So VVS Iyer, a partner of Bharti, says how will jewelry
 videshiyon ne bharat ko lut liya he
 So Bharti replied if the foreigners had also taken Ganga and Yamuna under wraps
 hamaari bharat mata to samraji hai
 Whatever it is, Mother India exists
 ab ham use dekh sakate hai
 If you want, you can make it according to your wish
 bharat mata kii jai ek naaraa ho saktaa he lekin bharat mata ek nahin ho sakati he
 For many people, Bharat Mata is the Bharat Mata who holds the tricolor in her hand
 lekin aresas kii website par jo bharat mata kii tasviir maujuud hai usamen tirangaa nahin he
 In one hand Bharat Maa is blessing and in the other hand there is saffron flag
 bharat mata kii jai bolne se pehle jaan lene main buraai nahin ki kis bharat mata kii jai kahana he
 Those who have the tricolor in their hands have to be cheered or those who do not have the tricolor in their hands
 vaise sangh kii website par jo bharat mata he unke haath main tirangaa kyon nahin he
 The RSS chief has said that everyone has to say Bharat Mata ki Jai
 unhone kaha ki vakt aa gaya he ki nai peedi ko bataanaa hoga ki unhen bharat mata kii jai bolnaa hoga
 But it should come on its own and should be a part of the development of the youth
 bharat mata or vande maataram ko lekar raajnneeti ho rahi he
 There is no need to panic
 raajnneetik dalon kii dikkat yahi he ki ve kabhi is maamle par eemaandaaree se bahes nahin karte, khaskar congress
 In whose session Vande Mataram is sung for the first time, she is nervous as never heard
 bhaajapa bharat mata kii jai kii daavedaari aise karti he ki jab tak aap bologe nahin aap deshbhakt ho hi nahin sakate
 What happened in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly is not enough to throw out an MLA, our politics is defeated
 haar is myne main he ki vah thik se khadi hokar mudde ko aapke saamne rakhti nahin he
 After saving eyes, Congress became BJP in this matter
 bharat mata kii jai bolne se kahin zyada dilachasp he bharat mata kii vikaas yatra
 The market too had started saying Bharat Mata as an opportunity
 azaadi se pehle britain or germany se aane vaale saamaanon main bhartiya devi devataaon kii tasveeron or bharat mata kii tasviir kaa bhi istemaal hone laga tha taaki log unhen apana samajhakar kharidne lagen
 In response to Manchester-made foreign clothing, domestic merchants also began to photograph Bharat Mata on their products
 bharat mata or bharat maa ke saath ek jagah hind mata kaa naam bhi miltaa he
 There is a picture of Hindu Mother on this box of matches
 yah tasviir kab kii he isaki jaankaree nahin mil saki magar kya bharat mata hind mata bhi kahi jaati hogi
 Can it still be said bharat kaa naam bharat se hua he
 The name of a man is identified by the country but Bharat Mata is the mother of King Bharata
 iskaa koi pramaan nahin miltaa he
 There is another picture which has a picture of Bharat Mata but it is on a cloth station made in Ahmedabad
 to bharat mata sirf deshbhakti kaa pradarshan nahin he balki inke zariye bhakton kii jeb tak bhi pahunchaa ja saktaa he isaki khoj us vakt ke bazaar ne tabhi kar lee thi
 The comments rahamaan kaa jab vande maataram aayaa tha tab is gane par fishan sho tak hone laga tha
 Actually this is the natural form of patriotism
 ham jab chahen jahaan chahen istemaal kar saken
 In independent India also, the market took a lot of support from Mother India
 ek tasviir main upar likhaa he saare jahaan se acha hindustan hamaara
 a map of India is made in the middle
 nakshe ke bich main bharat mata hai
 Bharat Mata is riding the chariot which is being pulled by a lion
 haath main tirangaa he
 The lion has a halter in one hand
 neeche kinare likhaa he ganatantr diwas kii shubhakamanaayen today chaay
 Below are the daughters-in-law of Ekta Kapoor's popular serial Ki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi

 The diversity of pictures is immense as is the glory of Mother India
 in tasveeron main kabhi bharat mata ko gandhi aashirwad de rahe hai to kabhi gandhi ko bharat mata
 In one picture, Gandhi is in the lap of Mother India
 kai jagahon par gandhi netaji bhi dev rup main badalon ke bich nazar aate hai
 These pictures show that the freedom movement used the available symbols to convey the message to the people
 yah tasviren hi tab ke liye television or twitor ke samaan thim jiske zariye logon ne nehru ko dekha gandhi ko dekha, azaad or bhagat singh ko dekha
 In one picture, Nehru is saluting the tricolor but is not saluting like he usually does
 yahaan par nehru kaa haath chaati ke paas he
 Generally the people of the Union salute in this way
 bharat mata bandhanon se mukt hai
 His both hands are open, breaking the screws
 tasviir ke neeche khadey saare log seene ke paas haath le jaakar salaam kar rahe hai
 i do not want to go into the history of such a salute too much
 puraani dilli ke calendar postaron kii dukaan main milane vaali bharat mata kii tasveeron ko dekhiegaa kabhi
 You will know that there is so much diversity in the nature of Mother India
 kai shodh chaatro ne in calendar or postaron main devi-devtaa se lekar bharat mata kii vikaas yatra kaa gahan adhyayan kiya he
 Many people like Jyotindra Jain, Mrinalini Sinha, Geeti Sen and Sadan Jha study nationalism, all aspects of it through these photographs
 sumati ramasvami ne bhi ek kitaab likhi he THE GODESS AND THE NATION, MAPPING MOTHER INDIA
 Zuban's publisher Urvashi Butalia has allowed the use of photographs and information in this book
 ham antim baat kehane kaa daawa nahin karte magar yahi koshish he ki ham is vivaad ke jariye bharat mata kii vikaas yatra ko samajhen
 Does our Mother India look the same from the beginning as it does today
 har tasviir main bharat mata badal jaati he
 Our effort is just to take you on a journey of history and return from there to talk about something else
 jarur kuch baaten adhuri rah jaaengi or kuch aisi baat bhi hogi jise aap jodna chahenge, lekin iske liye abhi se maafee
 In the Puranas, many verses narrating the nature of the world from the birthplace will be found
 kya mulk kaa vaisaa nakshaa bhi miltaa he jaisaa ham aaj dekhte hai
 Ever wonder if there is no map and globe, then how would you imagine any country
 inke pehle log apane mulk kii kalpana kaise karte honge
 There was also a village and a state within the scope of the country
 ek gaanv se duusare gaanv janaa pardes janaa ho jaataa tha
 Vinoba Bhave once said in a pinch somewhere that one word is nation
 aglaa shabd he maharashtra or teesraa shabd he sau raashtra
 So there are regions ranging from a state with a name of a hundred nations in our nation
 is raashtra kii ek mata bharat mata kii jai bolne ko lekar vivaad ho rahaa he
 Our first Bharat Mata, conceived by Abanindranath Tagore
 tasveeron ke zariye logon ne pehali baar is bharat maa kaa didaar kiya tha
 During the Swadeshi movement in 1905, when the form of Mother India emerged from Abanindranath Tagore's brush, the imagination of people dreaming of freedom of the country caught fire
 jab yah pehali baar ek patrika main chhapi to sheershak tha spirit aaf mandar india
 Abanindranath Tagore had previously named her Banga Mata and later changed it to Bharat Mata
 sochie agar pehla naam bang mata hi rah jaataa to bharat mata kii vikaas yatra kisi hoti
 Anandmath had been composed before this picture in Bengal and Vande Mataram was being sung
 is bharat mata ke chaar haath hai
 Education, initiation, food and clothing are in his hands
 azaad bharat kii filmon main yahi roti kapadaa or makaan ban jaataa he
 There is no weapon, there is no flag
 gyaat tasveeron ke hisaab se pehali bharat mata ek saamaanya bengali mahila bhi nazar aati hai
 Soon, many pictures of Mother India began to be made across the country
 krantikari sanghathanon ne bharat mata kii tasveeron kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar diya
 During the raids, the English government used to be vigilant as soon as the picture of Bharat Mata was found
 anushilan samiti, ugantar party bharat mata kii tasveeron kaa istemaal karte hai to punjab main bharat mata sosayadi, madras main bharat mata association kaa vajood saamne aata he
 Everyone starts building their own Mother India, but gradually the image of Mother India begins to become almost permanent
 bharat mata ke chaar haath kii jagah do haath ho jate hai
 Initially the flag is seen, then the trident and the sword are seen
 kai tasveeron main tirange kaa bhi aagaman hota he
 Some do not have cycles, some have spinning wheel
 kuch tasveeron main bharat mata ke charnon main srilanka bhi aa jaataa he
 So if you look at the old pictures today, Pakistan and Afghanistan before partition will also be seen
 dekhne waalon ne devi durga main bharat mata ko dekha or bharat mata main maa durga ko
 Abinindranath Tagore's Mother India is neither with Bengal nor with trident due to Bengal
 kai tasveeron main sher ke rup bhi alag-alag dikhte hai
 Somewhere the lion is roaring, and somewhere it is calm with victory
 kuch tasveeron main sher ko is tarah se bhi dekha gaya he ki bharat mata taqatvar british hukumat kii sawari kar rahi hai
 Have taken them under their control
 devi hone ke kaaran kuch logon ko lagata he ki bharat mata to hai magar sabaki mata nahin hai
 Actually there are many modern elements in our freedom struggle, but the freedom movement runs with the Hindustan of the past
 uske pratikon se puri tarah algaav nahin kar paata
 Because of this you will see religious symbols along with nationalism and religious people will claim to be nationalists
 yahaan rashtravaadi se meraa matlab swatantraaa senaanee se he
 Photos of Bharat Mata are found in the north and east, but what was happening in the south
 vahaan bharat mata kii kalpana kaise pahunchati he
 Sumati Ramaswamy has introduced a picture in her book
 20 april 1907 kii he
 In Bengal, Abnindranath Tagore imagines Bharat Mata in 1905 while Mahakavi Subrahmanyam Bharti in the far south prints a photo of Bharat Mata on the front page of his newspaper
 intiya akhbaar kaa naam he
 This picture is printed as the goddess of the new year but she has one hand on the globe
 hindu, muslim, sikh, isai dikh rahe hai, jo naman kar rahe hai
 Then Owaisi did not have any problem as to why he is emerging in the calendar of a goddess
 bharat mata kii kai tasveeron main hindu, muslim, sikh, isai hote hai
 a picture was published by Bharti some time later
 tasviir chap rahi he dakshin bharat main lekin bharat mata kii is tasviir main vande maataram likhaa he devanagari main
 There are Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians at the feet of Bharat Mata, standing on the boat
 is tasviir main bharat mata ke ek haath main urdu main kuch likhaa hua he
 It is written Allahu Akbar
 yah sabaki bharat mata hai lekin kya aaj ke jamaane main yah sambhav he
 Often people start seeing Mother in the picture of Mother India and only Goddess Durga in Mother
 bharti ne is tasviir main sirf bharat dekha
 So there is Vande Mataram in Hindi and Allahu Akbar in Urdu
 pradhanmantri narendra modi aksar subrahmanyam bharti kaa zikr karte hai
 After the coming of the Modi government, when the postal stamp of many people was discontinued, but the postage stamps of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bismillah Khan and Subrahmanyam Bharti were regularized
 march 2015 main srilanka kii sansad main pradhanmantri modi ne bhaashan dete hue bharti ki kavita kii kuch panktiyaan padhin thim or kaha tha ki bharti mahaan rashtravaadi kavi the
 Bharti is the first person to be mentioned about whom he made efforts to make sculptures ranging from the picture of Mother India
 varna bahut kam logon kaa pataa chalata he ki banane vaale koun the, banavaane vaale koun the
 There is a great story
 1911 main mahakavi bharti abanindranath kii banaai bharat mata kii murti banane kaa prayaas karte hai
 The sculptor says that this India has not worn any ornaments at all
 to bharti ke ek saathi vivies ayyar kehete hai ki kaise honge gahane
 Foreigners have looted India
 to bharti ne jawaab diya ki kya videshi ganga or yamuna ko bhi lapetakar le gaye hai
 Our Mother India is empress
 jo bhi he bharat mata kaa vajood he
 Now we can see it
 chahen to apni marzi ke hisaab se bana sakate hai
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai may be a slogan but Bharat Mata may not be one
 kai logon ke liye bharat mata wo bharat mata he jinke haath main tirangaa he
 But the picture of Bharat Mata present on the RSS website does not contain the tricolor
 ek haath main bharat maa aashirwad de rahi hai to duusare haath main bhagava dhvaj he
 Before speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai, there is no harm in knowing which Bharat Mata ki Jai is to say
 jinke haath main tirangaa he unki jayakaara lagaani he yaa jinke haath main tirangaa nahin he unki jai-jai kehani he
 By the way, why is there no tricolor in the hands of Bharat Mata on the website of the Sangh
 aresas ke pramukh ne kaha he ki sabko bharat mata kii jai kahana hoga
 He said that the time has come that the new generation will have to tell that they will have to say Bharat Mata ki Jai
 par yah apane aap aana chahie or yuvaaon ke vikaas kaa hissaa hona chahie
 Politics is happening about Bharat Mata and Vande Mataram
 isse ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he
 The problem with political parties is that they never debate this matter honestly, especially the Congress
 jiske adhiveshan main pehali baar vande maataram gaaya gaya ho vah aise ghabraati he jaise kabhi suna na ho
 The BJP claims Bharat Mata Ki Jai in such a way that unless you speak you cannot be a patriot
 maharashtra vidhansabha main jo hua vah ek vidhayak ko baahar kar diya janaa bhar nahin he, hamaari raajnneeti kii haar he
 The defeat is in the sense that she does not stand up properly and put the issue in front of you
 jaise nazaren bachaakar is maamle main congress bhaajapa ho gai
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai is more interesting than speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai
 bazaar ne bhi mauka dekh bharat mata kahana shuru kar diya tha
 Before independence, pictures of Indian Gods and Mother India were also used in goods coming from Britain and Germany so that people could buy them as their own
 manchester ke bane videshi kapadon ke jawaab main desi vyapaariyon ne bhi apane utpaadon par bharat mata kii tasviir lagaani shuru kar di
 The name Bharat Mata is also found along with Bharat Mata and Bharat Mata
 maachis kii is dibbi par hind mata kii tasviir he
 The information of when this picture is done could not be found, but whether Bharat Mata is also called Mother India
 kya ab bhi kahi ja sakati he
 India is named from Bharata
 ek purush ke naam par mulk kii pahchaan he lekin bharat mata kya raja bharat kii maa hai
 There is no evidence of this
 ek or tasviir he jisamen bharat mata kii tasviir he magar vah ahmedabad main bane kapade ke thaan par he
 So Bharat Mata is not just a display of patriotism, but through it, the market of devotees can be reached, it was discovered by the market at that time
 tippaniyan When Rahman's Vande Mataram came, this song was going to be on the fashion show
 darasal deshbhakti kaa yahi swaabhaavik rup hota he
 We can use it whenever we want
 azaad bharat main bhi bazaar ne bharat mata kaa khub sahaara liya
 It is written in a picture above all where our good Hindustan is
 bich main bharat kaa nakshaa bana he
 In the middle of the map is Bharat Mata
 bharat mata rath par savaar he jise sher khinch rahaa he
 There is a tricolor in the hand
 ek haath main sher kii lagaam he
 The bottom edge reads: Happy tea today for Republic Day
 neeche ekta kapur ke lokapriy serial kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi kii bahuen hai
 From Ba to Tulsi
 tulsi kii aaj ek swatantra raajnneetik pahchaan he or ve bharat kii maanav sansaadhan mantri hai
 She was an artist then but even today many mps advertise
 sachin tendulkar, manoj tiwari, hema malini
 
 
 
 bharat mata kii mahima jitani aprampar he utani hi tasveeron kii vividhta apaar he
 In these pictures, Gandhi is blessing Mother India and sometimes Gandhi is giving Mother India
 ek tasviir main gandhi bharat mata kii god main hai
 In many places, Gandhi Netaji is also seen in the form of Dev among the clouds
 yah tasviren bataati hai ki swatantraaa andolan ne uplabdh pratikon kaa hi istamaal kiya logon tak sandesh pahunchane ke liye
 These pictures were similar to television and tweeters through which people saw Nehru, Gandhi saw Azad and Bhagat Singh
 ek tasviir main nehru tirange ko salaam kar rahe hai lekin vaise salaam nahin kar rahe jaise aam taur par karte hai
 Here Nehru's hand is near the chest
 aam taur par sangh ke log is tarah se salaam karte hai
 Bharat Mata is free from bondage
 unke donon haath shikanjon ko tod khule hue hai
 All the people standing under the picture are saluting by taking their hands near the chest
 main bahut zyaada is tarah kii salaami ke itihaas main nahin janaa chahta
 Is the same map of the country as we see today? kabhi sochiega gar nakshaa or globe na ho to aap kisi bhi mulk kii kalpana kaise karenge
 How would people imagine their country before them
 desh ke daayre main to gaanv bhi tha or rajya bhi
 Going from one village to another became known as Pardes
 vinoba bhaave ne ek baar chutki lete hue kahin kaha tha ki ek shabd he raashtra
 The next word is Maharashtra and the third word is hundred nations
 to hamaare raashtra main ek se lekar sau raashtra vaale naam ke rajya se lekar kshetra maujuud hai
 There is a dispute about speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai, one mother of this nation
 abanindranath tagaur kii kalpanashiltaa se bani hamaari pehali bharat mata
 Through photographs, people had seen this Mother India for the first time
 1905 main swadeshi andolan ke dauraan abanindranath tagaur kii kuchi se jab bharat mata kaa swaroop avatarit hua to desh kii azaadi kaa sapana dekh rahe logon kii kalpanaaon main aag lag gai
 When it first appeared in a magazine, it was titled Spirit of Mandar India
 abanindranath tagaur ne pehle inkaa naam bang mata rakhaa tha baad main bharat mata kar diya
 Think if Bharat Mata's development journey would have been like the first name Bang Mata
 us bengal main is tasviir se pehle aanandamath kii rachana ho chuki thi or vande maataram gaaya jane laga tha
 This Bharat Mata has four hands
 shiksha, diksha, ann or vastra hai inke haathon main
 In the films of independent India, this bread becomes cloth and house
 koi hathiyaar nahin he koi jhanda nahin he
 According to the known photographs, the first Bharat Mata is also a normal Bengali woman
 jaldi hi desh bhar main bharat mata kii anek tasviren banane lageen
 Revolutionary organizations started using photographs of Bharat Mata
 chhaapon ke dauraan bharat mata kii tasviir milte hi angreji hukumat chaukanni ho jaati thi
 Anushilan Samiti, Yugantar Party use photographs of Bharat Mata and Bharat Mata Society in Punjab, Bharat Mata Association in Madras comes into existence
 sab apni-apni bharat mata gadhane lagate hai lekin dhire-dhire tasveeron main bharat mata kaa rup kareeb-kareeb sthai hone lagata he
 Bharat Mata has two hands instead of four
 shuru main dhvaj dikhataa he phir trishul or talwaar dikhne lagata he
 The tricolor also appears in many photographs
 kisi main chakra nahin he to kisi main charkha he
 In some pictures, Sri Lanka also comes at the feet of Mother India
 to aaj agar aap puraani tasveeron ko dekhenge to vibhaajan se pehle kaa pakistan or afghanistan bhi nazar aayega
 Viewers saw Bharat Mata in Goddess Durga and Mother Durga in Mother India
 abanindranath tagaur kii bharat mata bengal kii hone ke kaaran na to sher ke saath hai na trishul ke saath
 The lion forms also look different in many photographs
 kahin sher gurraa rahaa he to kahin vijayi bhav se shant he
 In some pictures, the lion is also seen in a way that Bharat Mata is riding the mighty British rule
 unhen apane lagaam main le liya he
 Due to being a goddess, some people think that Bharat is mother but not everyone's mother
 darasal hamaari azaadi kii ladaai main kai aadhunik tatv hai magar swatantraaa andolan ateet ke hindustan ke saath chalata he
 Is not completely detached from its symbols
 is vajah se aapako rashtrawaad ke saath dharmik pratik dikhenge or dharmik vyakti rashtravaadi hone kaa daawa karte milenge
 By nationalist here i mean freedom fighter
 uttar or purab kii bharat mata kii tasviren to milti hai lekin dakshin main kya ho rahaa tha
 How does the imagination of Mother India reach there
 sumati ramasvami ne apni kitaab main ek tasviir pesh kii he
 20 April 1907
 bengal main abanindranath tagaur 1905 main bharat mata kii kalpana karte hai to sudur dakshin main mahakavi subrahmanyam bharti apane akhbaar ke mukhya prishth par bharat mata kii tasviir chhapate hai
 Intia is the name of the newspaper
 yah tasviir nae saal kii devi ke rup main chhapi he lekin unka ek haath globe par he
 Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians are seen, who are bowing
 tab to kisi ovaisi ko dikkat nahin hui ki ek devi ke calendar main ve kyon sheesh nava rahe hai
 Many pictures of Bharat Mata are Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian
 ek tasviir ko bharti ne kuch samay baad chapa tha
 The picture is printed in South India but in this picture of Mother India, Vande Mataram is written in Devanagari
 bharat mata ke charnon main hindu, muslim, sikh, isai hai, naav par khadey hai
 In this picture there is something written in Urdu in one hand of Bharat Mata
 yah likhaa hua he allaaho akbar
 This is the mother of all India, but is it possible in today's era? aksar log bharat mata kii tasviir main mata dekhne lag jate hai or mata main sirf devi durga
 Bharti only saw India in this picture
 isliye vahaan hindi main vandemataram he or urdu main allaaho akbar
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi often mentions Subrahmanyam Bharti
 modi sarkaar aane ke baad jab kai logon ke dak tikat ko band kar diya gaya tha magar bal gangadhar tilak, bismillah kaan or subrahmanyam bharti ke dak tikat ko niyamit karavaaya gaya tha
 In March 2015, Prime Minister Modi made a speech in the Parliament of Sri Lanka, read a few lines of Bharti's poem and said that Bharti was a great nationalist poet
 bharti pehle shaks hai jinke bare main zikr miltaa he ki unhone bharat mata kii tasviir se lekar murtiyon banane ke prayaas kiye
 Otherwise, very few people know who was the creator, who was the builder
 ek bada jabardast kissa miltaa he
 In 1911, Mahakavi attempts to make a statue of Bharat Mata made by Bharati Abanindranath
 murtikar kahata he ki is bharat ne kuch gahane hi nahin pahane hai
 So VVS Iyer, a partner of Bharti, says how will jewelry
 videshiyon ne bharat ko lut liya he
 So Bharti replied if the foreigners had also taken Ganga and Yamuna under wraps
 hamaari bharat mata to samraji hai
 Whatever it is, Mother India exists
 ab ham use dekh sakate hai
 If you want, you can make it according to your wish
 bharat mata kii jai ek naaraa ho saktaa he lekin bharat mata ek nahin ho sakati he
 For many people, Bharat Mata is the Bharat Mata who holds the tricolor in her hand
 lekin aresas kii website par jo bharat mata kii tasviir maujuud hai usamen tirangaa nahin he
 In one hand Bharat Maa is blessing and in the other hand there is saffron flag
 bharat mata kii jai bolne se pehle jaan lene main buraai nahin ki kis bharat mata kii jai kahana he
 Those who have the tricolor in their hands have to be cheered or those who do not have the tricolor in their hands
 vaise sangh kii website par jo bharat mata he unke haath main tirangaa kyon nahin he
 The RSS chief has said that everyone has to say Bharat Mata ki Jai
 unhone kaha ki vakt aa gaya he ki nai peedi ko bataanaa hoga ki unhen bharat mata kii jai bolnaa hoga
 But it should come on its own and should be a part of the development of the youth
 bharat mata or vande maataram ko lekar raajnneeti ho rahi he
 There is no need to panic
 raajnneetik dalon kii dikkat yahi he ki ve kabhi is maamle par eemaandaaree se bahes nahin karte, khaskar congress
 In whose session Vande Mataram is sung for the first time, she is nervous as never heard
 bhaajapa bharat mata kii jai kii daavedaari aise karti he ki jab tak aap bologe nahin aap deshbhakt ho hi nahin sakate
 What happened in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly is not enough to throw out an MLA, our politics is defeated
 haar is myne main he ki vah thik se khadi hokar mudde ko aapke saamne rakhti nahin he
 After saving eyes, Congress became BJP in this matter
 bharat mata kii jai bolne se kahin zyada dilachasp he bharat mata kii vikaas yatra
 The market too had started saying Bharat Mata as an opportunity
 azaadi se pehle britain or germany se aane vaale saamaanon main bhartiya devi devataaon kii tasveeron or bharat mata kii tasviir kaa bhi istemaal hone laga tha taaki log unhen apana samajhakar kharidne lagen
 In response to Manchester-made foreign clothing, domestic merchants also began to photograph Bharat Mata on their products
 bharat mata or bharat maa ke saath ek jagah hind mata kaa naam bhi miltaa he
 There is a picture of Hindu Mother on this box of matches
 yah tasviir kab kii he isaki jaankaree nahin mil saki magar kya bharat mata hind mata bhi kahi jaati hogi
 Can it still be said bharat kaa naam bharat se hua he
 The name of a man is identified by the country but Bharat Mata is the mother of King Bharata
 iskaa koi pramaan nahin miltaa he
 There is another picture which has a picture of Bharat Mata but it is on a cloth station made in Ahmedabad
 to bharat mata sirf deshbhakti kaa pradarshan nahin he balki inke zariye bhakton kii jeb tak bhi pahunchaa ja saktaa he isaki khoj us vakt ke bazaar ne tabhi kar lee thi
 The comments rahamaan kaa jab vande maataram aayaa tha tab is gane par fishan sho tak hone laga tha
 Actually this is the natural form of patriotism
 ham jab chahen jahaan chahen istemaal kar saken
 In independent India also, the market took a lot of support from Mother India
 ek tasviir main upar likhaa he saare jahaan se acha hindustan hamaara
 a map of India is made in the middle
 nakshe ke bich main bharat mata hai
 Bharat Mata is riding the chariot which is being pulled by a lion
 haath main tirangaa he
 The lion has a halter in one hand
 neeche kinare likhaa he ganatantr diwas kii shubhakamanaayen today chaay
 Below are the daughters-in-law of Ekta Kapoor's popular serial Ki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi
 ba se lekar tulsi tak hai
 Tulsi today has an independent political identity and is India's Human Resources Minister
 ve tab kalakaar thim lekin aaj bhi kai saansad vigyaapan to karte hi hai
 Sachin Tendulkar, Manoj Tiwari, Hema Malini
 
 
 
 The diversity of pictures is immense as is the glory of Mother India
 in tasveeron main kabhi bharat mata ko gandhi aashirwad de rahe hai to kabhi gandhi ko bharat mata
 In one picture, Gandhi is in the lap of Mother India
 kai jagahon par gandhi netaji bhi dev rup main badalon ke bich nazar aate hai
 These pictures show that the freedom movement used the available symbols to convey the message to the people
 yah tasviren hi tab ke liye television or twitor ke samaan thim jiske zariye logon ne nehru ko dekha gandhi ko dekha, azaad or bhagat singh ko dekha
 In one picture, Nehru is saluting the tricolor but is not saluting like he usually does
 yahaan par nehru kaa haath chaati ke paas he
 Generally the people of the Union salute in this way
 bharat mata bandhanon se mukt hai
 His both hands are open, breaking the screws
 tasviir ke neeche khadey saare log seene ke paas haath le jaakar salaam kar rahe hai
 i do not want to go into the history of such a salute too much

 The lion has a halter in one hand
 neeche kinare likhaa he ganatantr diwas kii shubhakamanaayen today chaay
 Below are the daughters-in-law of Ekta Kapoor's popular serial Ki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi
 ba se lekar tulsi tak hai
 Tulsi today has an independent political identity and is India's Human Resources Minister

 The diversity of pictures is immense as is the glory of Mother India
 in tasveeron main kabhi bharat mata ko gandhi aashirwad de rahe hai to kabhi gandhi ko bharat mata
 In one picture, Gandhi is in the lap of Mother India
 kai jagahon par gandhi netaji bhi dev rup main badalon ke bich nazar aate hai
 These pictures show that the freedom movement used the available symbols to convey the message to the people
 yah tasviren hi tab ke liye television or twitor ke samaan thim jiske zariye logon ne nehru ko dekha gandhi ko dekha, azaad or bhagat singh ko dekha
 In one picture, Nehru is saluting the tricolor but is not saluting like he usually does
 yahaan par nehru kaa haath chaati ke paas he
 Usually the people of the Union salute in this way 
 bharat mata bandhanon se mukt hai
 His both hands are open, breaking the screws
 tasviir ke neeche khadey saare log seene ke paas haath le jaakar salaam kar rahe hai
 i do not want to go into the history of such a salute too much
 jaldi hi desh bhar main bharat mata kii anek tasviren banane lageen
 Revolutionary organizations started using photographs of Bharat Mata
 chhaapon ke dauraan bharat mata kii tasviir milte hi angreji hukumat chaukanni ho jaati thi
 Anushilan Samiti, Yugantar Party use photographs of Bharat Mata and Bharat Mata Society in Punjab, Bharat Mata Association in Madras comes into existence
 sab apni-apni bharat mata gadhane lagate hai lekin dhire-dhire tasveeron main bharat mata kaa rup kareeb-kareeb sthai hone lagata he
 Bharat Mata has two hands instead of four
 shuru main dhvaj dikhataa he phir trishul or talwaar dikhne lagata he
 The tricolor also appears in many photographs
 kisi main chakra nahin he to kisi main charkha he
 In some pictures, Sri Lanka also comes at the feet of Mother India
 to aaj agar aap puraani tasveeron ko dekhenge to vibhaajan se pehle kaa pakistan or afghanistan bhi nazar aayega
 Viewers saw Bharat Mata in Goddess Durga and Mother Durga in Mother India
 abanindranath tagaur kii bharat mata bengal kii hone ke kaaran na to sher ke saath hai na trishul ke saath
 The lion forms also look different in many photographs
 kahin sher gurraa rahaa he to kahin vijayi bhav se shant he
 In some pictures, the lion is also seen in a way that Bharat Mata is riding the mighty British rule
 unhen apane lagaam main le liya he
 Due to being a goddess, some people think that Bharat is mother but not everyone's mother
 darasal hamaari azaadi kii ladaai main kai aadhunik tatv hai magar swatantraaa andolan ateet ke hindustan ke saath chalata he
 Is not completely detached from its symbols
 is vajah se aapako rashtrawaad ke saath dharmik pratik dikhenge or dharmik vyakti rashtravaadi hone kaa daawa karte milenge
 By nationalist here i mean freedom fighter
 uttar or purab kii bharat mata kii tasviren to milti hai lekin dakshin main kya ho rahaa tha
 How does the imagination of Mother India reach there
 sumati ramasvami ne apni kitaab main ek tasviir pesh kii he
 20 April 1907
 bengal main abanindranath tagaur 1905 main bharat mata kii kalpana karte hai to sudur dakshin main mahakavi subrahmanyam bharti apane akhbaar ke mukhya prishth par bharat mata kii tasviir chhapate hai
 Intia is the name of the newspaper
 yah tasviir nae saal kii devi ke rup main chhapi he lekin unka ek haath globe par he
 Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians are seen, who are bowing
 tab to kisi ovaisi ko dikkat nahin hui ki ek devi ke calendar main ve kyon sheesh nava rahe hai
 Many pictures of Bharat Mata are Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian
 ek tasviir ko bharti ne kuch samay baad chapa tha
 The picture is printed in South India but in this picture of Mother India, Vande Mataram is written in Devanagari
 bharat mata ke charnon main hindu, muslim, sikh, isai hai, naav par khadey hai
 In this picture there is something written in Urdu in one hand of Bharat Mata
 yah likhaa hua he allaaho akbar
 This is the mother of all India, but is it possible in today's era? aksar log bharat mata kii tasviir main mata dekhne lag jate hai or mata main sirf devi durga
 Bharti only saw India in this picture
 isliye vahaan hindi main vandemataram he or urdu main allaaho akbar
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi often mentions Subrahmanyam Bharti
 modi sarkaar aane ke baad jab kai logon ke dak tikat ko band kar diya gaya tha magar bal gangadhar tilak, bismillah kaan or subrahmanyam bharti ke dak tikat ko niyamit karavaaya gaya tha
 In March 2015, Prime Minister Modi made a speech in the Parliament of Sri Lanka, read a few lines of Bharti's poem and said that Bharti was a great nationalist poet
 bharti pehle shaks hai jinke bare main zikr miltaa he ki unhone bharat mata kii tasviir se lekar murtiyon banane ke prayaas kiye
 Otherwise, very few people know who was the creator, who was the builder
 ek bada jabardast kissa miltaa he
 In 1911, Mahakavi attempts to make a statue of Bharat Mata made by Bharati Abanindranath
 murtikar kahata he ki is bharat ne kuch gahane hi nahin pahane hai
 So VVS Iyer, a partner of Bharti, says how will jewelry
 videshiyon ne bharat ko lut liya he
 So Bharti replied if the foreigners had also taken Ganga and Yamuna under wraps
 hamaari bharat mata to samraji hai
 Whatever it is, Mother India exists
 ab ham use dekh sakate hai
 If you want, you can make it according to your wish
 bharat mata kii jai ek naaraa ho saktaa he lekin bharat mata ek nahin ho sakati he
 For many people, Bharat Mata is the Bharat Mata who holds the tricolor in her hand
 lekin aresas kii website par jo bharat mata kii tasviir maujuud hai usamen tirangaa nahin he
 In one hand Bharat Maa is blessing and in the other hand there is saffron flag
 bharat mata kii jai bolne se pehle jaan lene main buraai nahin ki kis bharat mata kii jai kahana he
 Those who have the tricolor in their hands have to be cheered or those who do not have the tricolor in their hands
 vaise sangh kii website par jo bharat mata he unke haath main tirangaa kyon nahin he
 The RSS chief has said that everyone has to say Bharat Mata ki Jai
 unhone kaha ki vakt aa gaya he ki nai peedi ko bataanaa hoga ki unhen bharat mata kii jai bolnaa hoga
 But it should come on its own and should be a part of the development of the youth
 bharat mata or vande maataram ko lekar raajnneeti ho rahi he
 There is no need to panic
 raajnneetik dalon kii dikkat yahi he ki ve kabhi is maamle par eemaandaaree se bahes nahin karte, khaskar congress
 In whose session Vande Mataram is sung for the first time, she is nervous as never heard
 bhaajapa bharat mata kii jai kii daavedaari aise karti he ki jab tak aap bologe nahin aap deshbhakt ho hi nahin sakate
 What happened in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly is not enough to throw out an MLA, our politics is defeated
 haar is myne main he ki vah thik se khadi hokar mudde ko aapke saamne rakhti nahin he
 After saving eyes, Congress became BJP in this matter
 bharat mata kii jai bolne se kahin zyada dilachasp he bharat mata kii vikaas yatra
 The market too had started saying Bharat Mata as an opportunity
 azaadi se pehle britain or germany se aane vaale saamaanon main bhartiya devi devataaon kii tasveeron or bharat mata kii tasviir kaa bhi istemaal hone laga tha taaki log unhen apana samajhakar kharidne lagen
 In response to Manchester-made foreign clothing, domestic merchants also began to photograph Bharat Mata on their products
 bharat mata or bharat maa ke saath ek jagah hind mata kaa naam bhi miltaa he
 There is a picture of Hindu Mother on this box of matches
 yah tasviir kab kii he isaki jaankaree nahin mil saki magar kya bharat mata hind mata bhi kahi jaati hogi
 Can it still be said bharat kaa naam bharat se hua he
 The name of a man is identified by the country but Bharat Mata is the mother of King Bharata
 iskaa koi pramaan nahin miltaa he
 There is another picture which has a picture of Bharat Mata but it is on a cloth station made in Ahmedabad
 to bharat mata sirf deshbhakti kaa pradarshan nahin he balki inke zariye bhakton kii jeb tak bhi pahunchaa ja saktaa he isaki khoj us vakt ke bazaar ne tabhi kar lee thi
 The comments rahamaan kaa jab vande maataram aayaa tha tab is gane par fishan sho tak hone laga tha
 Actually this is the natural form of patriotism
 ham jab chahen jahaan chahen istemaal kar saken
 In independent India also, the market took a lot of support from Mother India
 ek tasviir main upar likhaa he saare jahaan se acha hindustan hamaara
 a map of India is made in the middle
 nakshe ke bich main bharat mata hai
 Bharat Mata is riding the chariot which is being pulled by a lion
 haath main tirangaa he
 The lion has a halter in one hand
 neeche kinare likhaa he ganatantr diwas kii shubhakamanaayen today chaay
 Below are the daughters-in-law of Ekta Kapoor's popular serial Ki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi
 ba se lekar tulsi tak hai
 Tulsi today has an independent political identity and is India's Human Resources Minister

 i do not want to go into the history of such a salute too much
 bharat mata ke chaar haath kii jagah do haath ho jate hai
 Initially the flag is seen, then the trident and the sword are seen
 kai tasveeron main tirange kaa bhi aagaman hota he
 Some do not have cycles, some have spinning wheel
 kuch tasveeron main bharat mata ke charnon main srilanka bhi aa jaataa he
 So if you look at the old pictures today, Pakistan and Afghanistan before partition will also be seen
 dekhne waalon ne devi durga main bharat mata ko dekha or bharat mata main maa durga ko
 Abinindranath Tagore's Mother India is neither with Bengal nor with trident due to Bengal
 kai tasveeron main sher ke rup bhi alag-alag dikhte hai
 Somewhere the lion is roaring, and somewhere it is calm with victory
 kuch tasveeron main sher ko is tarah se bhi dekha gaya he ki bharat mata taqatvar british hukumat kii sawari kar rahi hai
 Have taken them under their control
 devi hone ke kaaran kuch logon ko lagata he ki bharat mata to hai magar sabaki mata nahin hai
 Actually there are many modern elements in our freedom struggle, but the freedom movement runs with the Hindustan of the past
 uske pratikon se puri tarah algaav nahin kar paata
 Because of this you will see religious symbols along with nationalism and religious people will claim to be nationalists
 yahaan rashtravaadi se meraa matlab swatantraaa senaanee se he
 Photos of Bharat Mata are found in the north and east, but what was happening in the south
 vahaan bharat mata kii kalpana kaise pahunchati he
 Sumati Ramaswamy has introduced a picture in her book
 20 april 1907 kii he
 In Bengal, Abnindranath Tagore imagines Bharat Mata in 1905 while Mahakavi Subrahmanyam Bharti in the far south prints a photo of Bharat Mata on the front page of his newspaper
 intiya akhbaar kaa naam he
 This picture is printed as the goddess of the new year but she has one hand on the globe
 hindu, muslim, sikh, isai dikh rahe hai, jo naman kar rahe hai
 Then Owaisi did not have any problem as to why he is emerging in the calendar of a goddess
 bharat mata kii kai tasveeron main hindu, muslim, sikh, isai hote hai
 a picture was published by Bharti some time later
 tasviir chap rahi he dakshin bharat main lekin bharat mata kii is tasviir main vande maataram likhaa he devanagari main
 There are Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians at the feet of Bharat Mata, standing on the boat
 is tasviir main bharat mata ke ek haath main urdu main kuch likhaa hua he
 It is written Allahu Akbar
 yah sabaki bharat mata hai lekin kya aaj ke jamaane main yah sambhav he
 Often people start seeing Mother in the picture of Mother India and only Goddess Durga in Mother
 bharti ne is tasviir main sirf bharat dekha
 So there is Vande Mataram in Hindi and Allahu Akbar in Urdu
 pradhanmantri narendra modi aksar subrahmanyam bharti kaa zikr karte hai
 After the coming of the Modi government, when the postal stamp of many people was discontinued, but the postage stamps of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bismillah Khan and Subrahmanyam Bharti were regularized
 march 2015 main srilanka kii sansad main pradhanmantri modi ne bhaashan dete hue bharti ki kavita kii kuch panktiyaan padhin thim or kaha tha ki bharti mahaan rashtravaadi kavi the
 Bharti is the first person to be mentioned about whom he made efforts to make sculptures ranging from the picture of Mother India
 varna bahut kam logon kaa pataa chalata he ki banane vaale koun the, banavaane vaale koun the
 There is a great story
 1911 main mahakavi bharti abanindranath kii banaai bharat mata kii murti banane kaa prayaas karte hai
 The sculptor says that this India has not worn any ornaments at all
 to bharti ke ek saathi vivies ayyar kehete hai ki kaise honge gahane
 Foreigners have looted India
 to bharti ne jawaab diya ki kya videshi ganga or yamuna ko bhi lapetakar le gaye hai
 Our Mother India is empress
 jo bhi he bharat mata kaa vajood he
 Now we can see it
 chahen to apni marzi ke hisaab se bana sakate hai
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai may be a slogan but Bharat Mata may not be one
 kai logon ke liye bharat mata wo bharat mata he jinke haath main tirangaa he
 But the picture of Bharat Mata present on the RSS website does not contain the tricolor
 ek haath main bharat maa aashirwad de rahi hai to duusare haath main bhagava dhvaj he
 Before speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai, there is no harm in knowing which Bharat Mata ki Jai is to say
 jinke haath main tirangaa he unki jayakaara lagaani he yaa jinke haath main tirangaa nahin he unki jai-jai kehani he
 By the way, why is there no tricolor in the hands of Bharat Mata on the website of the Sangh
 aresas ke pramukh ne kaha he ki sabko bharat mata kii jai kahana hoga
 He said that the time has come that the new generation will have to tell that they will have to say Bharat Mata ki Jai
 par yah apane aap aana chahie or yuvaaon ke vikaas kaa hissaa hona chahie
 Politics is happening about Bharat Mata and Vande Mataram
 isse ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he
 The problem with political parties is that they never debate this matter honestly, especially the Congress
 jiske adhiveshan main pehali baar vande maataram gaaya gaya ho vah aise ghabraati he jaise kabhi suna na ho
 The BJP claims Bharat Mata Ki Jai in such a way that unless you speak you cannot be a patriot
 maharashtra vidhansabha main jo hua vah ek vidhayak ko baahar kar diya janaa bhar nahin he, hamaari raajnneeti kii haar he
 The defeat is in the sense that she does not stand up properly and put the issue in front of you
 jaise nazaren bachaakar is maamle main congress bhaajapa ho gai
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai is more interesting than speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai
 bazaar ne bhi mauka dekh bharat mata kahana shuru kar diya tha
 Before independence, pictures of Indian Gods and Mother India were also used in goods coming from Britain and Germany so that people could buy them as their own
 manchester ke bane videshi kapadon ke jawaab main desi vyapaariyon ne bhi apane utpaadon par bharat mata kii tasviir lagaani shuru kar di
 The name Bharat Mata is also found along with Bharat Mata and Bharat Mata
 maachis kii is dibbi par hind mata kii tasviir he
 The information of when this picture is done could not be found, but whether Bharat Mata is also called Mother India
 kya ab bhi kahi ja sakati he
 India is named from Bharata
 ek purush ke naam par mulk kii pahchaan he lekin bharat mata kya raja bharat kii maa hai
 There is no evidence of this
 ek or tasviir he jisamen bharat mata kii tasviir he magar vah ahmedabad main bane kapade ke thaan par he
 So Bharat Mata is not just a display of patriotism, but through it, the market of devotees can be reached, it was discovered by the market at that time
 tippaniyan When Rahman's Vande Mataram came, this song was going to be on the fashion show
 darasal deshbhakti kaa yahi swaabhaavik rup hota he
 We can use it whenever we want
 azaad bharat main bhi bazaar ne bharat mata kaa khub sahaara liya
 It is written in a picture above all where our good Hindustan is
 bich main bharat kaa nakshaa bana he
 In the middle of the map is Bharat Mata
 bharat mata rath par savaar he jise sher khinch rahaa he
 There is a tricolor in the hand
 ek haath main sher kii lagaam he
 The bottom edge reads: Happy tea today for Republic Day
 neeche ekta kapur ke lokapriy serial kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi kii bahuen hai
 From Ba to Tulsi
 tulsi kii aaj ek swatantra raajnneetik pahchaan he or ve bharat kii maanav sansaadhan mantri hai
 She was an artist then but even today many mps advertise
 sachin tendulkar, manoj tiwari, hema malini
 
 
 
 bharat mata kii mahima jitani aprampar he utani hi tasveeron kii vividhta apaar he
 In these pictures, Gandhi is blessing Mother India and sometimes Gandhi is giving Mother India
 ek tasviir main gandhi bharat mata kii god main hai
 In many places, Gandhi Netaji is also seen in the form of Dev among the clouds
 yah tasviren bataati hai ki swatantraaa andolan ne uplabdh pratikon kaa hi istamaal kiya logon tak sandesh pahunchane ke liye
 These pictures were similar to television and tweeters through which people saw Nehru, Gandhi saw Azad and Bhagat Singh
 ek tasviir main nehru tirange ko salaam kar rahe hai lekin vaise salaam nahin kar rahe jaise aam taur par karte hai
 Here Nehru's hand is near the chest
 aam taur par sangh ke log is tarah se salaam karte hai
 Bharat Mata is free from bondage
 unke donon haath shikanjon ko tod khule hue hai
 All the people standing under the picture are saluting by taking their hands near the chest
 main bahut zyaada is tarah kii salaami ke itihaas main nahin janaa chahta
 Due to being a goddess, some people think that Bharat is mother but not everyone's mother
 darasal hamaari azaadi kii ladaai main kai aadhunik tatv hai magar swatantraaa andolan ateet ke hindustan ke saath chalata he
 Is not completely detached from its symbols
 is vajah se aapako rashtrawaad ke saath dharmik pratik dikhenge or dharmik vyakti rashtravaadi hone kaa daawa karte milenge
 By nationalist here i mean freedom fighter

 The diversity of pictures is immense as is the glory of Mother India
 in tasveeron main kabhi bharat mata ko gandhi aashirwad de rahe hai to kabhi gandhi ko bharat mata
 In one picture, Gandhi is in the lap of Mother India

 Generally the people of the Union salute in this way

 Otherwise, very few people know who was the creator, who was the builder
 ek bada jabardast kissa miltaa he
 In 1911, Mahakavi attempts to make a statue of Bharat Mata made by Bharati Abanindranath
 murtikar kahata he ki is bharat ne kuch gahane hi nahin pahane hai
 So VVS Iyer, a partner of Bharti, says how will jewelry
 videshiyon ne bharat ko lut liya he
 So Bharti replied if the foreigners had also taken Ganga and Yamuna under wraps
 hamaari bharat mata to samraji hai
 Whatever it is, Mother India exists
 ab ham use dekh sakate hai
 If you want, you can make it according to your wish
 bharat mata kii jai ek naaraa ho saktaa he lekin bharat mata ek nahin ho sakati he
 For many people, Bharat Mata is the Bharat Mata who holds the tricolor in her hand
 lekin aresas kii website par jo bharat mata kii tasviir maujuud hai usamen tirangaa nahin he
 In one hand Bharat Maa is blessing and in the other hand there is saffron flag
 bharat mata kii jai bolne se pehle jaan lene main buraai nahin ki kis bharat mata kii jai kahana he
 Those who have the tricolor in their hands have to be cheered or those who do not have the tricolor in their hands
 vaise sangh kii website par jo bharat mata he unke haath main tirangaa kyon nahin he
 The RSS chief has said that everyone has to say Bharat Mata ki Jai
 unhone kaha ki vakt aa gaya he ki nai peedi ko bataanaa hoga ki unhen bharat mata kii jai bolnaa hoga
 But it should come on its own and should be a part of the development of the youth
 bharat mata or vande maataram ko lekar raajnneeti ho rahi he

 What happened in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly is not enough to throw out an MLA, our politics is defeated

 In response to Manchester-made foreign clothing, domestic merchants also began to photograph Bharat Mata on their products
 bharat mata or bharat maa ke saath ek jagah hind mata kaa naam bhi miltaa he
 There is a picture of Hindu Mother on this box of matches

 There is another picture which has a picture of Bharat Mata but it is on a cloth station made in Ahmedabad

 The diversity of pictures is immense as is the glory of Mother India
 in tasveeron main kabhi bharat mata ko gandhi aashirwad de rahe hai to kabhi gandhi ko bharat mata
 In one picture, Gandhi is in the lap of Mother India
 kai jagahon par gandhi netaji bhi dev rup main badalon ke bich nazar aate hai
 These pictures show that the freedom movement used the available symbols to convey the message to the people
 yah tasviren hi tab ke liye television or twitor ke samaan thim jiske zariye logon ne nehru ko dekha gandhi ko dekha, azaad or bhagat singh ko dekha
 In one picture, Nehru is saluting the tricolor but is not saluting like he usually does
 yahaan par nehru kaa haath chaati ke paas he
 Generally the people of the Union salute in this way
 bharat mata bandhanon se mukt hai
 His both hands are open, breaking the screws
 tasviir ke neeche khadey saare log seene ke paas haath le jaakar salaam kar rahe hai
 i do not want to go into the history of such a salute too much
 ek tasviir ko bharti ne kuch samay baad chapa tha
 The picture is printed in South India but in this picture of Mother India, Vande Mataram is written in Devanagari
 bharat mata ke charnon main hindu, muslim, sikh, isai hai, naav par khadey hai
 In this picture there is something written in Urdu in one hand of Bharat Mata
 yah likhaa hua he allaaho akbar
 This is the mother of all India, but is it possible in today's era? aksar log bharat mata kii tasviir main mata dekhne lag jate hai or mata main sirf devi durga
 Bharti only saw India in this picture
 isliye vahaan hindi main vandemataram he or urdu main allaaho akbar
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi often mentions Subrahmanyam Bharti
 modi sarkaar aane ke baad jab kai logon ke dak tikat ko band kar diya gaya tha magar bal gangadhar tilak, bismillah kaan or subrahmanyam bharti ke dak tikat ko niyamit karavaaya gaya tha

 pradhanmantri narendra modi aksar subrahmanyam bharti kaa zikr karte hai
 After the coming of the Modi government, when the postal stamp of many people was discontinued, but the postage stamps of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bismillah Khan and Subrahmanyam Bharti were regularized
 march 2015 main srilanka kii sansad main pradhanmantri modi ne bhaashan dete hue bharti ki kavita kii kuch panktiyaan padhin thim or kaha tha ki bharti mahaan rashtravaadi kavi the
 Bharti is the first person to be mentioned about whom he made efforts to make sculptures ranging from the picture of Mother India
 varna bahut kam logon kaa pataa chalata he ki banane vaale koun the, banavaane vaale koun the
 There is a great story
 1911 main mahakavi bharti abanindranath kii banaai bharat mata kii murti banane kaa prayaas karte hai
 The sculptor says that this India has not worn any ornaments at all
 to bharti ke ek saathi vivies ayyar kehete hai ki kaise honge gahane
 Foreigners have looted India
 to bharti ne jawaab diya ki kya videshi ganga or yamuna ko bhi lapetakar le gaye hai
 Our Mother India is empress
 jo bhi he bharat mata kaa vajood he
 Now we can see it
 chahen to apni marzi ke hisaab se bana sakate hai
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai may be a slogan but Bharat Mata may not be one
 kai logon ke liye bharat mata wo bharat mata he jinke haath main tirangaa he
 But the picture of Bharat Mata present on the RSS website does not contain the tricolor
 ek haath main bharat maa aashirwad de rahi hai to duusare haath main bhagava dhvaj he
 Before speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai, there is no harm in knowing which Bharat Mata ki Jai is to say
 jinke haath main tirangaa he unki jayakaara lagaani he yaa jinke haath main tirangaa nahin he unki jai-jai kehani he
 By the way, why is there no tricolor in the hands of Bharat Mata on the website of the Sangh
 aresas ke pramukh ne kaha he ki sabko bharat mata kii jai kahana hoga
 He said that the time has come that the new generation will have to tell that they will have to say Bharat Mata ki Jai
 par yah apane aap aana chahie or yuvaaon ke vikaas kaa hissaa hona chahie
 Politics is happening about Bharat Mata and Vande Mataram
 isse ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he
 The problem with political parties is that they never debate this matter honestly, especially the Congress
 jiske adhiveshan main pehali baar vande maataram gaaya gaya ho vah aise ghabraati he jaise kabhi suna na ho
 The BJP claims Bharat Mata Ki Jai in such a way that unless you speak you cannot be a patriot
 maharashtra vidhansabha main jo hua vah ek vidhayak ko baahar kar diya janaa bhar nahin he, hamaari raajnneeti kii haar he
 The defeat is in the sense that she does not stand up properly and put the issue in front of you
 jaise nazaren bachaakar is maamle main congress bhaajapa ho gai
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai is more interesting than speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai
 bazaar ne bhi mauka dekh bharat mata kahana shuru kar diya tha
 Before independence, pictures of Indian Gods and Mother India were also used in goods coming from Britain and Germany so that people could buy them as their own
 manchester ke bane videshi kapadon ke jawaab main desi vyapaariyon ne bhi apane utpaadon par bharat mata kii tasviir lagaani shuru kar di
 The name Bharat Mata is also found along with Bharat Mata and Bharat Mata
 maachis kii is dibbi par hind mata kii tasviir he
 The information of when this picture is done could not be found, but whether Bharat Mata is also called Mother India
 kya ab bhi kahi ja sakati he
 India is named from Bharata
 ek purush ke naam par mulk kii pahchaan he lekin bharat mata kya raja bharat kii maa hai
 There is no evidence of this
 ek or tasviir he jisamen bharat mata kii tasviir he magar vah ahmedabad main bane kapade ke thaan par he
 So Bharat Mata is not just a display of patriotism, but through it, the market of devotees can be reached, it was discovered by the market at that time
 tippaniyan When Rahman's Vande Mataram came, this song was going to be on the fashion show
 darasal deshbhakti kaa yahi swaabhaavik rup hota he
 We can use it whenever we want
 azaad bharat main bhi bazaar ne bharat mata kaa khub sahaara liya
 It is written in a picture above all where our good Hindustan is
 bich main bharat kaa nakshaa bana he
 In the middle of the map is Bharat Mata
 bharat mata rath par savaar he jise sher khinch rahaa he
 There is a tricolor in the hand
 ek haath main sher kii lagaam he
 The bottom edge reads: Happy tea today for Republic Day
 neeche ekta kapur ke lokapriy serial kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi kii bahuen hai
 From Ba to Tulsi
 tulsi kii aaj ek swatantra raajnneetik pahchaan he or ve bharat kii maanav sansaadhan mantri hai
 She was an artist then but even today many mps advertise
 sachin tendulkar, manoj tiwari, hema malini
 
 
 
 bharat mata kii mahima jitani aprampar he utani hi tasveeron kii vividhta apaar he
 In these pictures, Gandhi is blessing Mother India and sometimes Gandhi is giving Mother India
 ek tasviir main gandhi bharat mata kii god main hai
 In many places, Gandhi Netaji is also seen in the form of Dev among the clouds
 yah tasviren bataati hai ki swatantraaa andolan ne uplabdh pratikon kaa hi istamaal kiya logon tak sandesh pahunchane ke liye
 These pictures were similar to television and tweeters through which people saw Nehru, Gandhi saw Azad and Bhagat Singh
 ek tasviir main nehru tirange ko salaam kar rahe hai lekin vaise salaam nahin kar rahe jaise aam taur par karte hai
 Here Nehru's hand is near the chest
 aam taur par sangh ke log is tarah se salaam karte hai
 Bharat Mata is free from bondage
 unke donon haath shikanjon ko tod khule hue hai
 All the people standing under the picture are saluting by taking their hands near the chest
 main bahut zyaada is tarah kii salaami ke itihaas main nahin janaa chahta
 There is a great story

 unke lekhan main prakruti kii jhalak shaayad isiilie sampoornataa main maujuud he
 The rhythmic beauty of the verses of Padma Sachdev is a direct result of your familiarity with Sanskrit poetry

 Virat Kohli had done the right thing
 kohli ne pichley match main shreyas ayyar ko padaarpan kaa mauka diya tha, lekin vah ballebaaji karne nahin utar paae the
 In the second match, it is expected that Iyer will be in the final XI
 kiwi gendbaajon main se sirf mishael santner hi bhartiya gendbaajon ko shuruyaat main kuch had tak roak paae the
 All the other bowlers proved to be expensive, although Ish Sodhi did take two wickets

 The Delhi match was the last match of fast bowler Ashish Nehra
 unke jane ke baad team main ek tej gendbaaj kii jagah khaali hui he
 In such a situation, Mohammad Siraj, who was included in the team in this series, can make his debut
 kiwi team kii fielding bhi pichley match main kamjor rahi thi
 In such a situation, guests need to improve in three areas
 ballebaaji main newjiland team kii aas captain ken williamson, ross tailor, martin gaptil or tom latham par he inke alaava agar colin munro kaa balla chal gaya, to vah bhartiya team ke liye pareshaani khadi kar sakate hai
 The 'virat Record' will remain on watch If Virat Virav manages to score 12 runs in this match, then another record will be made in his name
 kohli aisa karte hi tii-20 main ran banane ke maamle main srilanka ke tillakaratne dilashaan (1889 ran) ko peeche chhod duusare sthaan par aa jaaenge
 Brendon mccullum (2140 runs) currently tops
 yajuvendra chahal or teen wicket lete hai, to maujuuda calendar year main apane 17 wicket puure kar lenge
 This will put him jointly in the first place in the list of highest wicket-taking bowlers this year
 afghanistan ke raashid khan or westeindies ke kesric williams ke naam 17-17 wicket hai

 The crushing defeat of the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections has shaken the party leaders inside
 rahul gandhi ke congress adhyaksh pad se istipha waapas na lene par ade rahane ke faisal se party netritv ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti bani hui he
 Congress leaders are constantly meeting in search of Rahul's alternative, but so far no name has been stamped
 congress adhyaksh pad se rahul gandhi ke istipha die hue kareeb maheene ho gaye hai
 Many Congress leaders tried to convince Rahul but they could not succeed
 ab tak congress adhyaksh ke liye kisi kaa naam tay nahin ho sakaa he
 Due to this, there is confusion in the party
 is kaaran tamaam faisle lambit pade hue hai
 This is the reason that voices are being raised from within the Congress to find an alternative to Rahul
 congress ke varisht netaa or chhattisgarh ke party prabharee piel puniya ne ajtak se baatcheet karte hue kaha, 'maine party ke senior netaaon se baat kii he or main rahul gandhi se bhi mil chukaa hum, par mujhe nahin lagata ki vah apana faisla waapas lene ja rahe hai
 He is steadfast in his decision and will continue to work for the party
 unhone kaha ki aise main party ke varisht netaaon ko is uljhan kaa samaadhaan nikaalnaa padegaa, kyonki party ko lagaataar nuksaan ho rahaa he
 At the same time there is increasing stability and restlessness in the party
 congress party ko is sankat se baahar aakar aage badhanaa hoga uske liye rahul gandhi kii jagah vikalp dhundhna jaruri he
 However, many speculations are being made about the names of the Congress president
 nae adhyaksh ke taur par ashok gahalot or eke antni ke naam kii charchaaen chal rahi hai
 But AK Antony remains silent on this issue
 itnaa hi nahin congress ke or bhi netaa kuch bolne ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 The interesting thing is that even after the requests of activists and leaders, Rahul Gandhi is not troubled by his decision in successive meetings
 isse yah saaf he ki rahul gandhi apana faisla nahin badalenge or party ko nae adhyaksh kii talash kerani hogi
 RSS ideologue and nominated Rajya Sabha member Rakesh Sinha took a dig at the Congress position and said that the Congress party has lost the ability to think ahead of Rahul Gandhi and the Gandhi family
 usko lagata he ki uskaa guzaara gandhi parivaar ke bagaiyr nahin ho saktaa
 In such a situation, the condition of the Congress cannot improve until it adopts the democratic system

 On the second day of his tour, on Thursday (june 28), the BJP president visited Purulia

 But now the Trinamool Congress (TMC) has surrounded PM Narendra Modi and Shah on Shah's tweet after this rally
 or poocha he- aakhir modi or shah main se jhooth koun bol rahaa he
 What is that tweet? Actually, Amit Shah tweeted on Thursday - 'addressed a huge rally in Purulia

 biplab deb kaa kahana he ki jo log sankeern maansikta vaale hai, unhen is baat kaa vishwaas nahin ho rahaa he
 These people are undermining their own country
 biplab ne kaha ki sach ko sweekaar karnaa hi hoga, khud bhi kanfus naa hon or dusron ko bhi nahin karen
 What did you say? 
 
 aapako bataa den ki mangalvaar ko ek kaarykram ke dauraan biplab deb ne mahabharat main internet ke istemaal kaa daawa kiya tha
 In Guwahati, he gave a statement that 'india has been using the Internet since ages
 mahabharat main sanjay ne netraheen hote hue bhi dhritarashtra ko yuddh ke maidan kaa haal sunaaya tha
 Which happened due to internet and technology
 'sirf internet nahin biplab deb ne satellite hone kaa bhi daawa kiya
 He said that satellites were also present in that era
 darasal, biplab deb apane bhaashan main bharat ko digital kii disha main aage badhaane ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi kii prashansa kar rahe the
 Meanwhile, he said that Modi ji has made Facebook, whatsapp and Twitter popular among the people
 yahaan tak ki ab rajyon ke mukhyamantri bhi soshal media plateforms kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 While talking about the use of social media in the current politics, the Chief Minister of Tripura also said that India is an old civilization and we have been using technology for a long time

 dilli main hui rape kii ghatana ne texiyon main suraksha ke mudde ko uthaaya he
 Uber's taxi was used in this incident and in view of the company's attitude, it was claimed that Uber's service has been banned, at least that is what was said about delhi-ncr
 achaanak harakat main aae transport department ne list jari kar saaf kar diya ki sirf chah companiyon kii texiyon ko dilli kii sadakon par chalane kii ijazat he
 So, our correspondent Aditi Rajput and Mihir Gautam came out to know the truth of this claim at around 9:15 on the night of 9 December
 
 
 sabase pehle to yah bataaen ki baaki companiyon se alag ubar kii texiyon par aisa kuch nahin hota, jisase aap pahchaan paaen ki vah ubar kii taxi he
 The name of the company is not written like the taxi of other companies
 jab hamane pehali booking kerani chaahi, to driver ne kaha, do din tak chalaane ke liye manaa kiya gaya he, isliye main nahin aauungaa
 We felt that Bain's claims were true, but in the second attempt, the government's claims blew
 driver 15 minute hi dur tha, phone par tasalli de di ki vah jald hi pahunch rahaa he
 We were waiting outside the office, and lo, the car arrived early
 driver se hamane poocha, ham shoot karnaa chaahate hai, koi pareshaani to nahin
 After he said 'no', we boarded a taxi and headed towards Lajpat Nagar
 puure raste driver se baat hoti rahi
 According to him, after this news he had called the company, then the company said that if you want to run, then run, do not want to run
 
 
 haalanki koi pareshaani nahin he
 
 
 According to the driver, the company never told him that Uber was banned in Delhi
 driver ke mutabik, naukari jwoin karte vakt koi kairactor certificate bhi nahin maanga gaya tha, lekin haa, usne driving license zarur diya tha
 When asked if he ever goes to the office of the company (uber), he said, he never needed, nor did he ever call
 vaise, jis gaadi main ham gum rahe the, usamen jeepies nahin laga tha, lekin ubar company kaa phone tha
 The location on the phone was also coming where we were going, but the thing to think about is if the phone goes off
 
 
 is sawaal kaa jawaab driver ke paas bhi nahin tha
 
 
 All things aside, the biggest question that is now in front is that the mobile app of the company whose services are being claimed not only by the people sitting in power, but also by the Delhi Police, is constantly booking The taxi service is running continuously, and bills are also being sent to the people
 
 
 to phir yah kisi roak he
 
 
 It cannot even be called a prohibition to show off
 
 
 sarkaar ko yah samajhnaa hoga ki agar vah vaaki gambhir he to niyam kade kare

 dengue se nipatane ke liye engiti ne dilli me 10 vakeelon ko local kamishnar banaaya he or dilli police ko inaki madad karne kaa aadesh diya gaya he
 The job of these local commissioners will be to see how all departments are prepared to deal with diseases like dengue, chikungunya
 kya kya abhi tak taiyaariyon main kamiyaan he or kis-kis panpane kii sthiti he jisko rokna jaruri he
 The NGT has given this order on a petition stating that the Civic Agency is still not ready to deal with dengue and the problem cannot be solved by just fogging
 dilli sarkaar or MCD se naakhush ngtxaraasala engiti emsidi or dilli sarkaar kii ab tak kii taiyaariyon se naakhush he or engiti kisi bhi haal main rajdhani main dobaaraa vaise halaat nahin chaahati jaise halaat pichley saalon main logon ko dengue, chikangunia ke chalate jhelane pade hai
 The NGT was hearing a petition last year in which the court set up a special committee after Chikungunya grew in Delhi
 hai court haal hi main swat sangyaan lekar dengu or chikangunia ko dilli me rokane kii taiyaariyon par sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 The Delhi Government has put its side in the hearing held today in the NGT, the Delhi Government has stated its view that all the cases of dengue and chikungunya that have come up in the hospitals of Delhi are the patients coming to Delhi from other states
 vahiin emsidi ne bhi kaha ki wo dengue se nipatane ke liye apni taiyaariyon main juty hui he
 But the government and the civic agency did not seem happy with the response
 agali sunwaayee jab 20 may ko hogi to court ke dwaara niyukt kiye gaye 10 local kamishnar court ko puri dilli kii dengue or chikangunia se nipatane ke liye taiyaariyon kii vaastavik tasviir pesh karenge

 The Maoists term parliamentary democracy as 'boarbada' and presently many people agree with them
 bhartiya communist party-maovadi (sipii-maovadi) ke pravaktaa rahe or ab divangat cherukuri rajkumaar urf aaazaad kaa kahana tha, ''bhartiya rajya bade burjua-bade jameendaar varg kii sanyukt taanaashaahee hai, jo samrajyavad kaa poshan karata he
 It ensures the protection of the democratic interests of a handful of upper class people while dictating a large section of the general Indian public
 ''unke anusaar is vyavastha main sudhaar nahin kiya ja saktaa or ise krantikari hinsa ke dwaara 'ukhaad' phenkaa janaa chahie or isaki jagah par maovadiyon ke shashan ke tahat 'jan loktantr' laayaa janaa chahie
 According to many Maoist declarations, under this concept, the main goal of the revolution is to capture political power by the year 2050 after a long public war
 'bharat main asli khatra yah nahin he ki ve satta par kabja kar lenge, (jiskaa ve khwab dekhte rahete hai) balki yah he ki ve baari hinsa ko badhaava de sakate hai
 Against itself and against a large population, which, despite having little interest or involvement, is suffering in this confrontation
 unke siddhant kii asal samasya yah nahin he ki bharat sarkaar dwaara asamanta yaa anyaay karne kii unki baat galat he, balki yah he ki unka prastaavit 'samaadhaan' utopian (avyavhaarik), asambhav jaisaa or vastav main anutpaadak he
 In view of the grievances of the Maoists, the ruthlessness and some degree of vandalism, the selling of its elite class and the poverty and lack of large sections of the population can be seen everywhere
 pichhali krantiyon kaa itihaas dekhen (marxvaadi-leninvaadee yaa maovadi) to inase kisi nai aazaadee kaa srijan nahin hua, balki ek nae kism kii nirankushta hi saamne ai
 The Maoists justify their violence by saying that they do so in retaliation to the (active and systematic) violence of the state and the 'system'
 aaazaad kaa tark tha, ''logon ko sirf rajya kii hinsa kaa hi saamana nahin karnaa padataa
 In a society divided into sections like India, violence is at the root of the system and the oppressed population has to face it everywhere in everyday life
 darasal masalaa daman karne waalon kii hinsa ke baad bhadki yaa usase pehle hi hone vaali maovadiyon kii hinsa kaa nahin, balki nyaay kaa he
 If the violence of Naxalites is talked about, then it should be only in the context of violence present in every corner of our system
 ''varg sangharsh kii bhashaa kii chaashni main lipte ye daawey maovadi andolan kii sachai ke aage post pad jate hai
 More attention is directed towards some of the major actions of Maoists and their masked organizations such as stalling major industrial projects
 lekin sach yah he ki apane dabadabe vaale ilaakon main unhone bade udhyamon ke saath aisi maitreepurn sulah vaali vyavastha banaai he, jisamen kai udhyami yah sweekaar karte hai ki sarkari bhrashtachar kii tulana main maovadiyon kii rangadari 'sasti' padati he
 They have formed opportunistic alliances with many 'oppressive' groups
 kabhi kuch ranneetik vajahon se to kabhi sirf aarthik phaayde ke liye
 Most importantly, except for a few exceptions, they have done little to distort the existing political equations or have largely targeted the political executive, the center of state power and the main source of 'government repression'
 isse bhi zyada buree vaali baat yah he ki maovadi hinsa kaa shikaar hone vaale hajaaron logon kaa ek bada hissaa usee varg yaa samudaay se aata he, jisaki 'mukti' kaa ve daawa karte hai-garib, adivasee or dalit
 Such a murder is justified by calling it 'spies', 'traitors', 'class enemies', etc
, but the truth is that these murders cannot be beyond criticism
 brian crojiyar kehete hai, ''jahaan krantikari shatruon ke mukaable apane taraf ke logon kii hatya karne kii zyada jarurat samajhte hon, vahaan yah samaj janaa chahie ki yaa to unke andolan kaa vyapak virodh ho rahaa he yaa kam se kam jansankhya kaa ek bada hissaa unase ittefaq nahin rakhata
 "it would be considered a failure of the Indian state that a movement full of such contradictions has been going on for so long
" is andolan ke bare main khud pradhanmantri manmohan singh kehete hai, ''yah hamaare desh kii aantarik suraksha ke liye sabase badi chunauti he
 "but the administrative and political vacuum in a large area of the country has found fertile land for the Maoists to thrive there
" in ilaakon main sarkarein jivan or sampada kii suraksha, aparaadhon kaa nyaay or dand tathaa saamaajik evam aarthik tarakkee ke avasar sahit nunatam saarvajanik vasteen evam sevaayen muhaiyaa karaane main bhi lagaataar or lambey samay se vifal sabit hoti rahi hai
 In such circumstances it was bound to happen that other elements would come and fill this empty space
 yah bhi aprihaary tha ki ve sthaneey janata ke saath sampark banane main kanoon yaa kisi sthapit prakriya se bandhe nahin rahen or isaki vajah se aise sampark asweekaarya rup se hinsak hon
 The Maoists have also been helped a lot by the wavering attitude of the governments
 sarkaron kaa drushtikon kabhi kshamayachak kaa rahata he to kabhi samaj se pare ho jaataa he
 Take for example the repeated repeated claim of the Ministry of Home Affairs that 40,000 sq km allegedly 'liberated' by the Maoists in previous years
 ilaake main se 10,000 varg kimi
 Has been 'regained' by government security forces
 yah saaf nahin he ki bharat ke koun se ilaakon ko 'mukt' karaayaa gaya tha yaa vastav main jo adhikari itani udaartaa se 'mukt kshetron' ke bare main baat karte hai, ve iskaa matlab bhi jaanate hai yaa nahin
 But such projections need to be introduced to show some 'success' at a time when the persistent failure of several operations, such as the Chintalnad massacre of April 2010, led to the 'massive and coordinated campaigns' of the central government, evacuating the areas , Has demonstrated the inability of his 'strategy' to hold and develop them
 yahaan yah spasht karnaa mahatvapurn hoga ki 'mukt kshetra' maovadi shabdkosh kaa hissaa he
 a free zone is established when the enemy is completely destroyed and the rule of the revolutionary mass government is established
 jab maovadi ek niyamit sena jaisi visheshta hasil kar lete hai or sarkari balon ko jagah-jagah yaa kisi niyat sthaan par yuddh main ghaseet lete hai or jab maovadi party utpaadan kii apni vyavastha kaayam kar leti he
 'free zones' are those areas where the government does not have any kind of presence
 ek nirdhaarit 'niyantran rekha' main kisi bhi tarah ke hastkshep kaa paramparaagat sainya pratirodh (sirf gorilla karrwai nahin) se muqabla kiya jaataa he
 In Sri Lanka for example, the LTTE had for long maintained a 'free zone' in northern Sri Lanka, where they exercised extensive governance and protected their territory through an 'advance defense line'
 bharat main maovadiyon ke niyantran vaala is tarah kaa koi ilaaka nahin he
 There are only a few guerrillas or areas with their bases here
 yah sochna hi kaaphi haasyaaspad he ki adhiktam 20,000 sashastr cader or kareeb 50,000 kii 'jan sena' ke boote koi bharat main 'mukt kshetra' ko banaae rakh saktaa he, lekin sarkaar main ucchtam padon par baithe kai log bhi aisi baaten karte dikhte hai
 There is no free zone in India
 yahaan kushasan yaa ashasan ke kshetra hai, jiske tahat desh ke vibhinn hisson main thag, gang, jaateey ativaadee, islamic ativaadee yaa maovadi apana shashan chalaate hai
 The worst that can be established here is simply 'turbulent dominance', in which government agencies are prevented from supplying their administrative responsibilities or public goods with the help of violence
 bharat main maovadi andolan baari mauton vaale gatirodh se kam mauton vaale gatirodh kii dasha main pahunch gaya he
 Far from the noise of the 'dominating the region' exercise with heavy presence of the armed forces
 haalanki, shant, khufia soochna aadhaarit abhiyaan se party netritv ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaa he or unhen 'janayuddh ko puure desh main failaane' ke apane prayaason se peeche hatana padaa he
 They have again been reduced to the central areas of the so-called 'red Corridor'
 lekin yadi aise baichaiyn karne vaale vidroh se nipatane main sarkaar kii ranneeti evam ravaiya zyada spasht or kendrit nahin hota to is tarah kii raahat asthaayee hi sabit hogi

 The film Batla House is based on the famous encounter in Jamia Nagar, Delhi, in which two boys from Sanjarpur Mohammad Atif and Sajid Amin were killed

 In 2008, this encounter took place in Delhi

 par bottla house ke baad jis tarah kaa maahaul bana usne is gaanv ko aatank kii factory kaa tag de diya
 The mystery of Gin of Batla House has not been solved till date, but it has completely ruined the peace of the village

 Should the film be released? On the other hand, Shoaib feared that "if the witnesses or the presiding officers of the trial watch this film, they may suffer from prejudice

 Therefore, Batla House should not be allowed to be released till the trial is under consideration
 " is bich yah aarope bhi lagaaya ja rahaa he ki film ekatarfa or puri tarah se jaanch agenciyon kii kahani par aadhaarit he
 Because the makers did not make any attempt to find out the encounter or the side of the accused and their family members of the blasts

 buudhvaar ke episod main 'big bos' ne gharavaalon ko kashmir kii sardi kaa ahsaas karaayaa
 The sleep of the householders is the magic of this season
 
 
 ' gane se khuli
 The day started with Swami Om, who was asking Gaurav to explain to Bani that he should not be angry with her, he would not tolerate Bani's hatred
 iske baad 'big bos' ne captency or lagjri bajet ke liye tufaan task introdeus kiya
 The garden area of the house was given the look of Kashmir for this task
 ek iglu banaaya gaya jise gharavaalon ko milakar decorat karnaa tha
 After this, when the storm came, all the families had to go inside that igloo
 niyam ke anusaar sabase baad main ghusane vaale sadsy ko captaini kii res se baahar kiya janaa tha
 Even before the task started, Swami Om declared that he could go to any extent to win the task, so do not feel bad
 monalisa sabase pehle task se baahar huin, iske baad swami om stool lagaakar baith gaye
 To stop them, Gaurav Topra sat on the tunnel of Igloo
 baad main 'big bos' ke kehane par lopa ne ek laal gheraa lagaaya or gharavaalon ko iglu se dur rahane ke liye kaha
 The comments aglaa tufaan aane par iglu ke andar ghuste vakt lopamudra ko chot lagi jiske liye unhone bani ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 Bani said that she did not push Lopa before she came before him
 bani ne tu karke baat kii to lopa ne kaha ki bani sadak chhap bhashaa main baat karti hai
 After this there was a fierce fight between the two
 rohan or manavir ke bich-bachaav ke baad donon shant hue
 Gaurav got out of the task in this round
 baad main jab gaurav bani ke liye omelette lekar aae to om swami ne bani par coment kiya is bani ne unhen chetavanee di ki vah na unka naam len or na hi unke bare main baat karen
 After this, when the storm did not come for a long time, the family decided that the storm would come when i would go away from Igloo
 iglu se dur jate vakt lopa or rohan kii dhimi gati dekhakar manavir ne unpar coment kiya is par rohan or manavir ke bich jamkar bahes hui, gaurav or manu ke samajhane ke baad donon shant hue
 Meanwhile, in the bedroom, Gaurav tells Mona that after spending two-and-a-half months in the house, he realized the importance of their relationship, while Mona told that earlier he and Vikrant used to watch this show together
 unhone kaha ki jab vikrant ghar ke andar unase milane pahunche to ghar main unke saath aane kaa unka sapana puraa ho gaya
 When she after this, Nitibha was out in the third storm
 iske baad swami om iglu ke ekadam paas baith gaye
 Manu and Manveer decided that they would not let Swami Om go inside Igloo and they surrounded him and sat outside the igloo
 raat 12 baje ghar waalon ne manu punjabi ko janmdin kii badhai di
 Will Swami Om take off his clothes to win the task in tomorrow's episode? is task ke liye ghar ke garden aria ko kashmir kaa luk diya gaya
 An igloo was created, which the family members had to decorate together
 iske baad tufaan aane par sabhi gharavaalon ko us iglu ke andar janaa tha
 According to the rule, the member who entered the earliest was to be removed from the captaincy race
 task shuru hone se pehle hi swami om ne elaan kar diya ki task jeetne ke liye vah kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai isliye koi bura na maane
 Monalisa was first out of the task, followed by Swami Om Stool
 unhen rokane ke liye gaurav topda iglu ke tunnel par baith gaye
 Later, at the behest of 'bigg Boss', Lopa placed a red circle and asked the family to stay away from Igloo
 tippaniyan Lopamudra got hurt while entering the igloo when the next storm came, for which he blamed Bani
 bani ne kaha ki unhone lopa ko dhakka nahin diya vah unase pehle aa gai thim
 When Bani spoke with you, Lopa said that Bani talks in street print language
 iske baad donon ke bich jamkar ladaai hui
 The two calm down after intervening between Rohan and Manveer
 is round main gaurav task se baahar ho gaye
 Later, when Gaurav brought the omelette for Bani, Om Swami commented on Bani, this Bani warned him not to take his name nor talk about him
 iske baad kaaphi der tak jab tufaan nahin aayaa to gharavaalon ne tay kiya ki iglu se dur jaaenge tab shaayad tufaan aayega
 While going away from Igloo, seeing Lopa and Rohan's slow pace, Manveer commented on this, there was a fierce debate between Rohan and Manveer, both of them calm down after Gaurav and Manu explained
 is bich bedroom main gaurav mona se kehete hai ki ghar main do-dhai maheene bitaan ke baad unhen apane rishton kii ahmiyat kaa ahsaas hua, vahiin mona ne bataaya ki pehle vah or vikrant ek saath yah sho dekha karte the
 He said that when Vikrant came to meet him inside the house, his dream of coming with her to the house was fulfilled
 jab vah jab iske baad tisare tufaan main nitibha baahar ho gayi
 After this, Swami sat very close to Om Igloo
 manu or manavir ne tay kiya ki ve swami om ko iglu ke andar jane nahin denge or ve unhen gherkar iglu ke baahar baith gaye
 At 12 o'clock, the people of the house greeted Manu Punjabi on his birthday

 kal ke episod main kya task jeetne ke liye apane kapade utaar denge swami om? a Supreme Court comment has once again brought the issue of the Uniform Civil Code into the discussion
 supreme court ne shuukravaar ko die gaye ek faisle main kaha ki desh ke sabhi nagarikon ke liye samaan naagarik samhita lagu karne ke liye abhi tak koi prayaas nahin kiya gaya he
 While the Supreme Court has said many times in this regard
 nyaayamurti deepak gupta or nyaayamurti aniruddh kii peeth ne apane faisle main kaha ki goa bhartiya rajya kaa ek chamchamata udhaaharan he jisamen samaan naagarik samhita lagu he, jisamen sabhi dharmon kii parvaah kiye bina yah lagu he, wo bhi kuch simit adhikaron ko chhodkar
 The bench made these comments in a property dispute case
 peeth ne kaha ki goa rajya main lagu portugali naagarik samhita, 1867 he, jo uttaradhikaar or viraasat ke adhikaron ko bhi sanchalit karti he
 Whereas in India, no such law is applicable outside Goa
 peeth ne kaha ki yah gaur karnaa dilachasp he ki rajya ke niti nirdeshak siddhanton se jude bhaag chaar main samvidhan ke anuchhed 44 main nirmaataaon ne ummid kii thi ki rajya puure bharat main samaan naagarik samhita ke liye prayaas karegaa
 But till date no action has been taken in this regard
 peeth ne 31 prishth ke apane faisle main kaha, 'haalanki hindu adhiniyamon ko varsh 1956 main samhitabaddh kiya gaya tha, lekin is adaalat ke protsaahan ke baad bhi desh ke sabhi nagarikon ke liye samaan naagarik samhita lagu karne kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya gaya he'
 The top court also looked into the question whether the Portuguese Civil Code could be called a foreign law
 peeth ne kaha ki ye kanoon tab tak lagu nahin hote jab tak ki bharat sarkaar dwaara manyata praapt nahin ho or portugali naagarik samhita bhartiya sansad ke ek kanoon ke kaaran goa main lagu he
 The bench said, "therefore, Portuguese law which may be of foreign origin, but it became a part of Indian laws and the essence is that it is Indian law
 yah ab videshi kanoon nahin he
 Goa is the territory of India, all the people of Goa are citizens of India
 aapako bataa den ki supreme court kii yah tippanee isliye bhi ahm he kyonki teen talaak par bill paas kara chuki bijepi sarkaar ke agenda main kaaman civil code bhi he
 In the last tenure of the Modi government, a Law Commission was also formed to seek the opinion of everyone, who also submitted his report to the government
 lekin vipaksh ke baari virodh ke chalate teen talaak kii tarah isse bhi sarkaar ko peeche hatana padaa
 But soon after the second term, the Modi government passed the triple talaq bill in Parliament because this time it has the support of many parties in the Rajya Sabha
 isliye mana ja rahaa he ki supreme court kii is tippanee ke baad ek baar phir sarkaar is par vichaar kar sakati he
 At the same time, those protesting on this issue say that the government wants to impose Hindu law on minorities with the help of Common Civil Code
 har dharm or samudaay kii alag-alag manyataayen or vishwaas hai or unako apane hisaab se maanane kaa unhen puraa sanvaidhanik adhikaar he
 At the same time, Vice Chancellor Faizan Mustafa of Nalsar University of Law, Hyderabad, in a special conversation with ndtv's Managing Editor Ravish Kumar, gave a different opinion on these things
 unka kahana he'puure desh ke musalamaanon ko main bataa duun ki america main, videshon main ek hi lau he or vahaan par islam khub fal-phool rahaa he
 Nothing is done by law
 1981 se kai hai court or supreme court bhi kah chukaa he ki teen talaak invelid he'

 Australia lost both matches before the 3-test series between South Africa and Australia
 duusare test main to barish ke kaaram kaaphi khel nahin ho paaya, iske baavjood africa ne use chauthe din hi dhul chataa di

 india today ke sampadak prabhu chawla ne aaj tak ke kaarykram sidhi baat main bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh rajnath singh se baat kii
 Here are the key parts of that conversation: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh ji yesterday overshadowed your prime ministerial candidate
 unhone kah diya ki aapkaa netaa jo he vah majboot nahin he majaboor he
 See, i do not want to say anything about Manmohan Singh ji, how he is the Prime Minister
 unke paanch varsh ke kaarykaal ko is desh kii janata ne thik tareeke se dekh-samaj liya he
 As far as Advani is concerned, the people of this country have also seen the skillful manner in which they have discharged various responsibilities in their political life of 55 years
 aap majboot netaa ke rup main project kar rahe hai unako
 Your slogan is that strong leader
 koi ek ghatana nahin adwani ji ke rajnatik jivan kii ki koi kah de ki ve majboot netaa nahin hai
 Who is responsible for the terrorist you took to Kandahar? i will not hold anyone responsible
 atal ji ne saare rajnatik dalon kii baithak bulaai thi
 Manmohan Singh was the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha at that time, he was also involved in that meeting
 in sabaki sahmati se yah faisla kiya gaya tha ki jitne bhi yatriyon kaa apharan hua he, unhen kisi bhi surat main chhudaaya janaa chahie
 i have said repeatedly that this decision was taken in an emergency, so it cannot be measured on the morality scale
 jis tarah se unhone adwani ji ko dismis kiya
 
 
 Said that he had no achievement of five years
 jin partiyon ke sahyog se upie bana tha, aaj ve congress ko talaak de rahi hai
 Many parties are joining bjp's NDA
 congress rajnatik dharaatal par aaj akeli khadi he
 Dr
 manmohan singh ji kaa sawaal tha ki adwani ji home ministar, up-pradhanmantri rahe, unki ek uplabdhi to bataa dijie
 At Akshardham, Parliament was attacked
 dow
 Manmohan Singh ji forgets that whether Parliament was attacked, whether it was at Akshardham or Jammu, but at that time the morale of our security forces soldiers was so high that not a single terrorist could escape his target
 aatankwaad ke sankat se jujhane ke liye jo prabhavi kadam is sarkaar ko uthaanaa chahie, vah nahin uthaa pai
 Can you tell us one step after the Mumbai carnage, on the basis of which it can be said that this government has accepted terrorism as a challenge
 aapane kaha ki upie bikhar rahaa he, par aap koun-se ikatthe hai? aapako bijd ke mukhyamantri chhodkar bhaag gaye, baat karne tak ke liye taiyaar bhi nahin hue aapse
 The BJD is limited to 21 Lok Sabha constituencies of Odisha
 mana ki in kshetron main prabhaav rakhane vaali bijd ne rajg se naata tod liya
 But the parties RLD, ILD, Assam Gana Parishad, having influence up to 49 parliamentary constituencies, linked the NDA
 jinke saath aap samajhaita karte hai - jedies, devegoda or rajnath singh, adwani ji kii philosphy main kya antar he? sirf avasarvadita
 Have to sit in power
 gathbandhan kii raajnneeti aaj kii aavashyaktaa ban gai he
 We have not cheated anyone
 ham dhokhaa kha sakate hai, dhokhaa de nahin sakate
 Small leaders of regional parties are sweeping the dust
 aapane andhra pradesh main koshish kii, kisi ne aapke netaaon se baat nahin kii
 You spoke in Tamil Nadu, nobody spoke to you
 rashtriya netaaon ko chhutbhaiya bana dete hai ye chote-chote netaa
 It happens with everyone kisi ke saath elliance ho saktaa he, kisi ke saath nahin ho saktaa he
 You do not think that the existence of national parties is getting dwarfed
 satta main aane ke liye netaa kuch bhi karne ko taiyaar hai
 i do not want to discuss national parties and regional parties at this time
 is desh ke loktantr ke liye behatar hota ki do dhruv hote
 i understand that this will happen over time
 aapaki party main jhagada bahut he
 Confusion on an issue like Varun, one leader is speaking on TV, another is speaking, third is something else
 kya sach he? bataaie aap varun ko samarthan dete hai?maine jo bhi tivi par dekha, thik uske baad varun gandhi kaa phone aayaa
 He said that whatever is being shown is manipulation, even the voice is not mine
 uske baad maang hone lagi ki unki ummidavaari radd kii jaae
 We took the stand that we will not cancel his candidature
 dilli main south emsidi ke antargat aane vaale skulon main bachche angreji padhate dikhenge
 The South MCD Education Committee has approved the scheme
 mangalvaar ko south emsidi shiksha samiti kii baithak hui jisaki adhyakshata shiksha samiti adhyaksh sunil sahadev ne kii
 Though many issues related to the primary schools of MCD were discussed in the meeting, but there was special emphasis on English medium education in corporation schools
 baithak main adhikariyon ne samiti ke sadasyon ko bataaya ki dilli sarkaar ke skulon main primary kakshaon main angrezi padhai jaati he
 Many such Delhi government schools have been built near corporation schools whereby parents who want to teach English to children send them to Delhi government schools instead of corporation schools
 is baat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue nigam kii shiksha samiti ne tay kiya ki agle shikshan satr se nigam skulon main bhi angrezi madhyam main padhai shuru kii jaaegi
 After the verdict, the next session will start teaching English from nursery in South MCD schools and will be teaching English from the first grade in schools where there are no nursery classes
 nigam ke mutabik isse nigam kii aarthik sthiti main koi fark nahin padegaa
 Teachers teaching English will be placed in schools, and if there is no teacher in one school, they will be transferred from another school to those where there is no teacher teaching English
 shiksha samiti is babat sthaayee samiti aurasadan main prastaav laaegitaaki ise lagu kiya ja sake
 According to the corporation, this will also provide relief to those parents who want to teach their children through English medium but are not able to teach there due to the huge fees of private schools
 asaram kii sabase badi raajadaar thi shilpi urf sanchita gupta
 She used to arrange girls for Asaram

 darasal, asaram kii giraftaar se pehle hi shilpi faraar ho gai thi
 Since then, the police was vigorously searching for him
 lekin uskaa koi suraag police ko nahin mil paa rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, his lawyers had filed an anticipatory bail petition in the High Court
 lekin hai court ne us yachika ko khaarij kar diya or tabhi das minute ke andar shilpi ne khud court main jaakar aatmasamarpan kar diya tha
 According to the police, Shilpi's bail plea was rejected from the High Court at 3:30 pm and was surrendered at 3
40 pm
 tab police ko pataa chalaa tha ki sunwaayee ke dauraan vah court ke aas-paas hi maujuud thi
 But no one was aware of this
 isse pehle seshan court se shilpi kii jamaanat yachika khaarij ho chuki thi
 Shilpi used to be around Asaram around the clock
 police ko pataa tha ki usase poochtacha main kai ahm khulaase ho sakate hai
 Therefore Asaram's difficulties had increased rather than diminished
 isi dauraan peedita ne jodhpur police ko bataaya tha ki shilpi hi wo mahila thi, jo gurukul main padhane vaali ladakiyon ko asaram ke saamne samarpan karaati thi
 Used to prepare them for this task
 chaanbin ke dauraan jodhpur police ko pataa chalaa tha ki asaram ne isi kaam kii vajah se shilpi ko apane gurukal kaa warden banaaya tha
 The victim was also prepared by Shilpi to go to Asaram
 isi makasad se asaram ne shilpi ko haridwar ke ashram se hataakar chhindwara ke gurukul main warden bana kar bheja tha
 According to the police, Shilpi used to send the girls to Asaram after talking about the ghost of the ghost
 peedita ko bhi asaram ke paas akele bhejne kii sajeesh usee ne rachi thi
 The girl's parents had also trapped her in the trap
 police kii maane to shilpi kii peedita ke alaava bhi kai ladakiyon ko asaram ke shayankaksh tak pahunchaa chuki thi

 patni kiran raav ke kis ke saath shuru hua aamir kaa berthde celibrasion, photosamira ne kaha ki unako to film kii fees liye hue kaaphi samay ho gaya
 They no longer charge fees and their earnings depend only on the performance of the film
 agar unki filmon ne boxophis par acha pradarshan kiya to unki kamai zyada hoti he or agar film nahin chali to unki kamai kam hoti he
 Let me tell you that some time ago Shah Rukh Khan advised film actors to charge less fees
 unhone kaha tha ki film abhinaytaon ko film ko uske nirmaan ke drushtikon se dekhte hue kam fees leni chahie
 He said that if the actor charges less then a producer will be able to spend money on other aspects of the film

 At a time when MS Dhoni (MS Dhoni) is under the scanner of critics for his poor performance from bat (in terms of strike rate), a statement by Chief Selector MSK Prasad (MSK Prasad) further exacerbated the pressure on the former India captain Have given
 mukhya chayankarta emesake prasad ne kaha he ki rishabh pant (rishabh Pant) champion cricketer banane kii ore agrasar hai or isi varsh england main hone vaale worldcup (world Cup 2019) ke liye ve bhartiya team kii yojana main shaamil hai
 Though Prasad has not directly spoken about MS Dhoni but his statement is an indication that Pant may get a place in the World Cup 2019 Indian team as a wicket-keeper batsman
 
 aise main ballebaaji main kharaab pradarshan ke kaaran surkhiyon main bane dhoni (MS Dhoni) ke sthaan ko khatra ho saktaa he
 When the fans of Mahendra Singh Dhoni fiercely ridiculed Rishabh Pant
 
 
 dhoni (MS Dhoni) kii is baat ko lekar aalochana ho rahi he ki ve shorter formet ke cricket main strike ko teji se rotate nahin kar pate
 They take too many balls to make some runs in the beginning, due to which the pressure is increased on the forward batsmen
 test cricket se sanyas le chuke 37 varshiya dhoni (MS Dhoni) kii pahchaan ek samay shorter formet ke cricket ke behtareen 'finishr' ke rup main kii jaati thi lekin ab ve apane is pradarshan kii chaaya maatr hi najar aa rah hai
 Although Dhoni (MS Dhoni) scored 51 runs in difficult conditions in the first match of the series of three odis against Australia, he played 96 balls during this period
 unka strike rate 53
 13, which is not considered good in terms of short-form cricket
 haalanki dhoni kaa samarthan karne waalon kaa maananaa he ki sidney vanade main teen wicket saste main girane ke baad wicket par tikkar khelnaa samay kii maang thi lekin aalochakon kaa kahana he ki wicket par set hone ke baad bhi dhoni ne teji se ran nahin banaae
 Due to this, the desired run rate increased continuously and the entire responsibility of increasing the score fell on Rohit Sharma
 viraat kohli ne kiya khulaasa, is vajah se emes dhoni ko tii-20 team main nahin mili jagahemeske prasad (MSK Prasad) kaa maananaa he ki khel ke alag praroopon main bina kisi pareshaani khud ko dhaalane kii kaabiliyat ke chalate pant (rishabh Pant) worldcup 2019 abhiyaan ke liye bhartiya team kii yojana main shaamil hai
 After being rested for the ODI series against Australia and New Zealand, there has been speculation about his place in the England-going squad
 prasad ne PTI ko die intervyuu main kaha, ‚Äò pant (rishabh Pant) ne australia main teen tii20 or chaar test match khele, isse uske sharir par asar padaa
 He needs complete rest for two weeks, only then we will decide how many matches he will play against England Lions
 vah hamaari worldcup yojanaon kaa hissaa he
 Rishabh Pant said, Rahul Dravid learned a lot from Sir, now there will be a chance to learn from Dhoni bhai
 
 
 pant (rishabh Pant) kii tarif karte hue mukhya chayankarta prasad (MSK Prasad) ne kaha, vah (pant) champion cricketer banane kii ore bad rahaa he
 He has such ability, by which he himself is not fully aware
 'prasad is baat se khush hai ki rishabh is baat ko samaj rahaa he ki captain viraat kohli or coach ravi shastri kii usase kya ummiden hai or sidney main pradarshan isi ko darshata he
 He said, "ravi and Virat asked him to respect the conditions of the match and he did exactly that
 usne sabit kiya ki vah bina kisi pareshaani ke khud ko khel ke anuroop dhaal saktaa he
 When we selected him for the Test matches, the experts were skeptical about his wicketkeeping but the record of 11 catches in a Test in England and dismissing in the Australian series proves that the selection committee's favor was right
 ' a good news has come for the Australian team, which is suffering a defeat on the tour of India
 team ke visphotak ballebaaj aaron finch team india ke khilaaf indore main hone vaale tisare vanade match main khel sakate hai
 Let me tell you that Finch did not play in the first two matches of the ODI series due to a muscle strain
 australia indore vanade main aaron finch kii vaapasi ko lekar betaab he kyonki david warner ke saath unke nae opening partner hilton carterit team ko acchhee shuruyaat nahin de paa rahe hai
 In such a situation, the return of Finch will strengthen the Australian opening pair
 australian team main agar finch kii vaapasi hoti he tohilton carteritco plaing ilevan se baahar hona pad saktaa he
 Hilton Cartwright's performance in the first two odis has been extremely poor
 carterit ne do vanade maichon main 2 ran hi banaae hai
 Aaron Finch also practiced at the Nets before the Indore ODI on Saturday
 finch ke jodidar david warner ne bhi ummid jataai ki finch ravivaar ko unke saath pari kaa aagaaj karne ke liye feet ho jaaenge
 Warner said, you all know Aaron Finchkis is a batsman
 vah shandaar khilaadi hai
 Finch's presence leads to aggression in top orders
 use vaapasi ke liye kadaa abhyaas karte hue dekhnaa acha laga
 Hopefully he will be fit for tomorrow's match
 baat un dinon kii he jab main bataur clinical psychologist prashikshan le rahi thi
 Our job was to write a case study of different mental patients in the clinic six days a week and share their experiences with senior psychologists after counseling in the clinic, overall understanding the mental confusion of others
 main ek ke baad ek maansik rogiyon (yah zyaadaatar neurotic hote the, yani maansik beemaari jinaki gambhir str par nahin pahunchi hoti thi) se milti gai
 During this period, i grew up with a lot of people struggling with depression, anxiety, phobia, obsessive compulsions (OCD)
 in sabaki cese study main jo ek baat maine kaaman dekhi vah thi, vah yah kii in sabhi logon ko dusron ke dimag main ghusane kii bhayankar beemaari thi
 It is not that this was the only reason for psychiatry
 lekin yah ek ahm kaaran tha
 a married woman had a problem as to what her in-laws thought of her
 jabaki vah rahati duusare shahar main thi
 But she is bothered that her mother-in-law feels that she was robbing herself by being alone
 ho saktaa he kabhi sasuraal paksh ne yah taana maaraa ho
 But after that the woman simply thought that her in-laws had no other business than to think
 ek 24 varshiya ladki jo medical kii taiyaari kar rahi thi do prayaas asafal hone ke baad use yahi lagata ki log to yahi kahenge ki puraa din kitaab main ghusi rahi par hua kahin nahin
 What would a friend say when a boy who was not leaving his girlfriend because he had been married for five years now, when both of them were completely fed up with each other
 unki pasand na pasand bilkul alag thi
 i read every case study very closely and then discussed it with my senior psychologist
 unhone kaha, tumne bilkul thik pakadaa
 In fact, 70 percent of the psychiatrists have a habit of penetrating the minds of others
 log kya kahenge? log to yahi kahenge? falaan to mere bare na jane kya-kya sochataa he? log aksar vah karte hai jo log unase chaahate hai
 They don't do what they want to themselves
 khud ke dimag kii sunate sunate ve apane man-mastishk kii sunanaa band kar dete hai
 Bypassing their abilities, their desires, they have to live up to the expectations of the whole world, because it is not possible to live up to the expectations of everyone, but only many types of psychiatrists take care of them
 jabaki iskaa samaadhaan bilkul sidhaa or saral he
 Such people are so entrenched in the world of others that they become oblivious to themselves
 unki nijee duniya main kya chal rahaa unhen use jaanane kii fursat hi nahin hoti
 Cognitive thirapi (ie attempts to correct thoughts), family thirappi, autosuggestion, diary writing, i don't know what to try, but after a few days, then it would enter the mind of others
 2016 main mere haath ek kitaab lagi
 When i read it, i felt psychologist Kathleen Smith looking at this problem in exactly the same way as i felt
 lekin mere paas samaadha nahin tha
 Smith then created a framework and presented solutions to such people
 mashhoor manovaigyanik catholin smith (kathleen Smith) apni kitaab (everything Isn‚Äôt Terrible: Conquer Your Insecurities, Interrupt Your Anxiety, and Finally Calm Down) main dimag main ghusane kii aadat ko behad khatarnaak maanati hai
 She suggests
 
 
 aisi sthiti main ham kya karen or kya nahin?to


kya karen?-kuch to log kahenge logon kaa kaam he kahana
 
 
 So let me say - others taunted you and then they got busy looking for another victim and you got busy all day in revision of that taunt
 uske revijan se bachein-aapaki kshamtaayen or unke aade aane vaali baadhaaen aap samajhate hai
 The other person can see you just like that iceberg, whose 10 percent is up and 90 percent is down
 dusron kaa moolyankan sunen, ninda bhi sunen lekin khud ko khud bhi parakhen
 -boss, what does he think of me? He did not respond to my greetings
 jarur vah mujhase khafa he
 Focus on your work instead of thinking it
 haa kai baar ho saktaa he ki aapke bare main vaaki kuch dushprachaar chal rahaa ho
 You listen to him and take a long breath
 uske baad phir apane kaam main vyast ho jaaen
 - Calm your mind and look inside it, and what others are thinking, clean the garbage every day before sleeping
 kya naa karen-main khud ko sabit karke rahuungi-aai vil pruv miself
 
 
 Do not follow the syndrome
 pruf kiijie magar khud ke liye
 For those who really want to see you climb the stairs
 - super hero syndrome na paalen
 Everyone has different abilities
 harek jaisaa banane kaa khyaal na paalen
 Among the cultivation of ideas in the brain, do not let the taunts of others, the dreams of Khwamkwah, grow the crop of Shakas
 kyonki yah fasal itani khatarnaak he ki aapke sakaaratmak vichaaron ko khatm kar degi
 - Do not engage in making others happy
