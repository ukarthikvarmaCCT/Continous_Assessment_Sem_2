 uttar pradeshvidhan parishadkesabhapatiramesh yadav ke bete abhijit yadav urf vicky kihatyamein unka naukar bhi shaamil tha
 The police also arrested him on Monday
 darasal, is charchit hatyakand ke baad se hi ghar kaa naukar faraar tha
 The police was vigorously searching for him
 ramesh yadav ke 24 varshiya bete abhijit yadav urf vicky kii 20 oktober kii raat achaanak rahasyamayi haalat main maut ho gai thi
 The main accused in this murder is Meera Yadav, the mother of the deceased
 jo is vakt 14 din kii nyaayik hiraasat chalate jail main band he
 Now with the arrest of the servant, this case seems to be resolved
 police naukar poochtacha kar rahi he
 This was the case on the day of the incident i
e
 in the morning of 21 October, his son dies in the house of the Legislative Council Chairman Ramesh Yadav late in the night
 subah-subah police ghar pahunchati he
 But the mother sends the police saying that the son had a heart attack at night, due to which he died
 magar postmortem report se pataa chalata he ki maut dil kaa daura padane se nahin balki galaa ghontne kii vajah se hui he
 Doubt goes to the mother
 maa pakadi jaati he
 Also confesses to murder magar phir chand ghante ke andar hi wo kahati he ki bete kaa katl usne nahin balki kisi or ne kiya he
 And from here the confusion of Lucknow Police starts
 uski maa ne pehle kaha- abhijit ke seene main dard tha
 Then said - Short age was predicted
 iske baad kaha- maine hi abhijit ko maaraa
 But a few hours later said - i was falsely accused
 or phir kah diya ki abhijit ko maarane kii saazish hui he
 It is a strange story that the mother came out of Katilalkhanu
 jo mahila police kii giraft main ai he, wo koi aam mahila nahin hai
 Rather, Meera Yadav is the second wife of UP Legislative Council Chairman Ramesh Yadav
 patni hone ke saath-saath mira yadav naresh yadav ke do jawan beton kii maa bhi hai
 One of the same two sons, 24-year-old son Abhijeet, dies suddenly in mysterious condition on the night of 20 October
 maa kahati he ki bete ke seene main achaanak dard uthaa or wo mar gaya
 In fact, the first news came out in the early morning of October 21 from flat number-137 of B-block of Darulshafa in Lucknow that Abhijeet died of a heart attack
 khabar police ko bhi mili
 Now that the matter was about the death of the son of the Chairman of the Legislative Council, the police also reached home
 magar tab police ko ye kah kar ravaanaa kar diya gaya ki abhijit kii maut kudarti he
 The mother herself was witnessing a heart attack
 ab maa khud kah rahi thi lihaaza shaq kii koi gunjaaish hi nahin thi
 Abhijeet's bier was prepared after the police left and the funeral procession left for the crematorium
 magar antim sanskaar ho paata usase pehle achaanak ek baar phir police pahunch jaati he
 This time the police does not listen to anyone and Arthi takes possession and sends the body for postmortem
 galaa ghontkar kii gai hatyiske baad idha postmortem report ai udhar sari kahani badal gai
 It was learned that Abhijeet died not because of severe chest pain or heart attack but because of strangulation
 yani uskaa katl kiya gaya he
 Then why did the mother lie? Just this question gave the police a chance to arrest Abhijeet's mother
 idhar, abhijit kii maa police ke shikanje main aati he or fouran duusari kahani sanaati he
 This time it is said that he strangled his son Abhijeet with a chunni
 kyonki abhijeet raat nashe main ghar lautaa tha or usne uske saath budtamiji karne kii koshish kii thi
 After the mother's Iqbal-e-crime, the Lucknow police also took a sigh of relief that a high-profile murder case was solved quickly
 magar ab mira yadav ko police adaalat lekar pahunchati he to mira fouran phir nai kahani sunaati he
 And together she also says that she is being implicated in this case
 faqat 24 ghante ke andar vidhaan parishad ke sabhapati ramesh yadav kii duusari patni mira yadav 5 baar bayaan badal chuki thi
 But it was beyond comprehension that the person who had confessed to killing Abhijeet in the first police inquiry, why is he now conspiring behind this death? As the time passes, this murder case is now really Mystery is becoming
 pehle kaha gaya ki jis vakt daarulashafa ke bi-block ke flats number-137 main abhijit kii hatya hui
 At that time only his mother Meera Yadav was present in the house
 jabaki bada bhai abhishek ghar main nahin tha
 But now it is being said that at the time of Abhishek's death, elder brother Abhishek was also present in the house
 lihaaza police ne ab use bhi poochtacha ke liye hiraasat main le liya he
 Moreover, Meera Yadav has also accused her husband Ramesh Yadav of trapping her
 haalanki abhi tak to police ye maanakar chal rahi he ki abhijit kii hatya
 Mother Meera Yadav has done it
 lekin ab is maamle main ek or angel aa gaya he property vivaad kaa
 Actually Ramesh Yadav, the Chairman of the Legislative Council, has two wives
 pehali patni upi ke eta main rahati hai jinaki ek beti or ekabetaahai
 While Meera Yadav is the second wife of Ramesh Yadav who lives with her two sons Abhishek and Abhijeet in Darulshfa's b-block Flat No-137
 police abhi bhi is baat kii jaanch main juty he ki kya hatya ke vakt flats main koi or bhi maujuud tha yaa nahin
 At the same time, the Chairman of the Legislative Council, Ramesh Yadav is not ready to speak anything in this matter

 After the father's death, the responsibility of home fell on Bilal's shoulders and he left his studies in the middle

 petrol ke daam jab bhi badhate hai sarkaron kii tijori bharne lagati he
 The reason for this is that the Central and State Governments have imposed tremendous tax on petrol
 shuukravaar madhya raatri se dilli main saadhaaran petrol kii keemat 72
 43 per liter
 aaie dekhte hai ki usamen kitna paisa tel companiyon ko jaataa he or kitna sarkaron ke khajaane main
 Oil companies 116
 34 dollar prati bairal kaccha tel kharida
 At that time one dollar 62
 02 rupee kaa tha
 Marketing companies 46 for refining one liter of crude oil
 19 rupee kharch kiye
 The amount he charges per liter by charging excise duty and VAT from dealers is 48
 87 rupee
 Now another excise duty of the Central Government was imposed on it
 48 rupee he
 There is also education cess in this amount
 ab is par dilli main dealer kamishan he 2
 01 rupees
 rajdhani main is petrol par waite rupee he
 That means the total amount was 72
 43 rupee!ab aap samaj gaye honge ki petrol ke daam kitne kam hai lekin sarkarein kis tarah se mahange kachche tel kaa bahaanaa banaakar janata ke pocket se paise nikalava rahi hai
 Yes, petrol sold 46 rupees 87 paise per liter - 72 coming to you
 43 rupee kaa ho gaya he
 In fact, the state governments are the biggest earners from petrol and they are taking money from the public's hard earned income by levying VAT on the rates
 kuch rajyon main to 35 pratishat tak is par waite he or iske chalate iske daam aasmaan chhu rahe hai
 The biggest initiative in this direction has been taken by Goa's new CM Manohar Parrikar
 unhone petrol par waite hi hataa diya jisase goa main petrol sabase sasta ho gaya

 Rupala said that today the Congress is making fun of development, but i feel proud that because of Narendra Modi, development has become the central theme of Indian politics
 unhone kaha ki punjab ke mukhyamantri amarinder singh ne bhi apni chunavi reliyon main janata se ye vaayada kiya tha ki agar rajya kii satta unhen milti he to wo narendra modi ke gujarat kii tarj par punjab kaa vikaas karenge

 The problem with wipes is a danger not only to children but also to the environment
 plastic ke bane ye wips baio-degradable nahin hote or unhen puri tarah nasht hone main lagbhag 500 saal lag jate hai
 At the same time, eco-friendly wipes are made from plant fibers and are very soft
 saath hi paryaavaran ko haani nahin pahunchaate
 If we talk about European countries, there has been a campaign to ban plastic wipes because these wipes are the main reason for drainage
 aaj ke parivesh main wips kaa istemaal jahaan ek aam baat ho gai he vahiin wips se hone vaali pareshaaniyaan bhi badi hai
 According to Pooja Duggal, the founder of 'healthhunt
com', children's skin is very thin and soft and any fluid crosses it
 isliye wips istemaal karne se pehle bachche kii twachaa par kisi jelly yaa kriim se maalish karne se uski parat wips se hone vaale raishes se bachaati he
 By 2030, this disease will be highest among women, let the child care market grow at a rate of 17 percent, where its market was $ 14 billion in 2014, while in 2019 it is likely to cross $ 31 billion
 jahaan sthapit companiyaan apane nae utpaada laa rahi hai vahiin madar sparsh, mamaa arth, mom jaisi nai companiyaan paryaavaran ke saath hi bacchon kii komal twachaa kaa dhyaan rakhkar eco friendli utpaada utaar rahi hai
 Rishu Gandhi, the founder of Mother Sparsh and head of brand strategy, said, "mango or famous wipes are mostly made of plastic, which also contains higher amounts of chemicals according to children's skin
" jab in wips kaa istemaal zyada hota he to twachaa main khujali bad jaati he or twachaa sambandhi anya samasyaayein ho jaati hai
 These especially increase when we wipe the child with chemicals mixed wipes and keep them in the sun, then all these chemicals come in contact with sunlight and cause problems to children

 But among the first to be elected to the Lok Sabha in 2019, there are also politicians in a different kind of war — like the likes of Smriti Irani who came out of the ranks to defeat the Samajwadi Party's Azam Khan, BJP President Amit Shah and the legendary rival - for the first time

 kareeb do saal se duniya main aman-chaiyn kaa sabase bada dushman ban chukaa aatankwaadi sanghathan iesas ab ghutanon ke bal aa chukaa he
 Whether it is Syria or Iraq, it is continuously defeating itself in every stronghold
 apane 45 hazaar aatankwaadiyon ke maare jane ke baad ab baaki bache-khuche ilaaqon main bhi ye chaaron taraf se ghir chukaa he
 In such a situation, the IS now has only two routes left, either surrender with weapons or become a target of bullets
 yani kul mila kar iesas kaa khel ab bas khatm hone vaala he
 What was known till yesterday as the most dreaded terrorist organization of the world, today has become a group of cowards who have been killed in Iraq and Syria
 haalat ye he ki syria se lekar iraq tak uske tamaam kile darak chuke hai or ye aatankwaadi sanghathan ab aakiri hitchkee le rahaa he
 In Iraq, ISIS has come to its knees in Mosul, the capital of its largest stronghold and the Islamic regime of Baghdadi, while in Syria it is seeking refuge from different forces in the area of 6 lakh 22 thousand square kilometers
 america kii aguwai main mitra deshon kii fuj ke saath mil kariraqi fujor kurdish fiteron ne iesas ko buree tarah jakad liya he
 The situation is that the forces chasing the terrorists have now entered a large area in the Iraqi city of Mosul
 iraqi pradhanmantri haidar al abaadi ne ye saafe kar diya he ki ab iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ke paas do hi raste hai yaa to wo aatmasamarpan kar den yaa phir marane ke liye taiyaar rahen
 But if the experts are to be believed, the forces may have now dominated ISIS, but the real challenge is yet to be done because the residential areas of Mosul in which further battles are to be fought, have a population of about fifteen lakh people
 or aise main shahriyon ke rahete hue aatankwaadiyon ko chun chun kar maut ke ghat utraana zaraa mushkil kaam he
 Taking advantage of this compulsion of the army, terrorists have also started hiding the city by making them shield
 jate-jate wo tel ke kuon main bhi aag laga rahe hai, taaki barbaadi to ho hi, dhuen kaa faaydaa uthaa kar unhen nikal bhaagane main bhi aasaani ho
 In Syria, the people who were angry with the government had supported ISIS, when the real face of the same ISIS and Baghdad came in front of the people, people were shocked
 ab rus kii madad se syrian sarkaar ne bagdadi ke khilaaf morcha kholaa he, to aam log bhi hathiyaaron ke saath aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf maidan e jang main utar aae hai
 The situation is that in cities like Raqqa and Aleppo, till yesterday the leaf did not move without the will of ISIS, now the fortress of Baghdadi has started shaking like cards
 syria or iraq main ab beshak iesas ke paanv ukhdane lage hon, lekin asli ladaai abhi baaki he
 This is the battle of the Iraqi city of Mosul, which is the city that Baghdadi had declared as the capital of its so-called Islamic rule
 lekin ab fuj ne mosul ko chaaron ore se gher liya he
 And seeing the near death, these terrorists are now preparing to shield the 1
5 million innocent townspeople of this city
 anjaam kya hoga, koi nahin jaanata
 Town Bertella is a few kilometers from the Iraqi city of Mosul
 isaayiyon ke is chote se shahar main iesas ne saikadon logon ko sirf isliye chun-chun kar maut ke ghat utaar diya tha kyonki wo apana dharm badalane ko taiyaar nahin the
 But now this excess of terrorists has become a thing of the past
 bartela se iraqi fuj ne aatankwaadiyon ko khaded diya he

 Does iphone need dual sim? What is the reason that Apple does not launch dual sim iphone? And did this happen that caused Apple to apply for a dual SIM patent? Let's try to know
 saadhaaran si baat he, dual sim vaale smartphone bharat jaise pragatishil deshon main zyada chalan main hai
 This is because it can save users money
 lekin maujuuda daur main aipal yphone kaa share bhartiya bazaar main kaaphi kam he or america jaise deshon main iske torget yujar paise bachaane ke liye yphone nahin kharidte auradual sim se unka koi sarokaarabhi nahin hota
 This not only applies to Apple, but companies like Samsung and Motorola also launch single SIM variants in markets like the US, while bringing dual SIM variants of the same smartphone to countries like India and Indonesia
 report ke mutabik aipal ne dual sim ke liye patent kaa aavedan kiya he jisamen uski khaasiyat bataai gai hai
 With this, those rumors are also being strengthened that the iphone 8 will have a variant dual sim
 aisa kyon?- bharat main zyaadaatar yugers dual sim smartphone yuj karte hai- kai badi companiyaan apane flagship smartphone kaa dual sim vairient bharat main launch kar rahi hai
 - The demand for dual sim smartphones is increasing in developing countries - Apple can also bring dual sim iphone to compete with high end Android smartphones
 - dual sim se logon ko alag alag telecom companiyon ke plan chunane main sahuuliyat hoti he
 - If there is no network in one SIM, then mobile can be used from another
 - internet kaa plan alag alag lene main bhi sahuuliyat
 - Apple is preparing to open its plant and apple store in India
 yugers ko dual sim smartphone kii jarurat kyon: sastekoling plan, saste internetplan or behatar network sabase badi vajah hai dual sim ke liye
 But the category of iphone users does not usually think of cheap calling or internet plan
 haalanki bhartiya yphone yugers jaahir he network or plan ke bare main sochate hai
 Why Apple Does Not Launch Dual Sim iphone: In most of the market, Apple sells iphone which is locked with network providers which are locked
 udhaaharan ke taur par bharat main airtel ke saath yphone bikta he jisame saal bhar aap sirf airtel kaa hi sim yuj kar sakate hai
 Apart from this, due to the slim, light and more battery life of the iphone, Dual Apple has not yet launched a dual sim smartphone
 lekin ab bazaar badal chukaa he or yugers bhi
 Especially at a time when Apple is preparing to set up its plant in India
 jaahir he plant lagegaa to yahaan aipal store bhi khulegaa or bhartiya bazaar main iphone kii share bhi badhegi
 Apart from India, there are many countries where Apple lags behind in some cases
 aisa sambhav he ki is vajah se bhi agle saal aapako yphone kaa dual sim vairient dekhne ko mil saktaa he

 The report said that the terrorists were given training related to surveillance, study of maps, fighting in urban areas and kidnapping
 patrika main kaha gaya he ki kasaab ke jaanchakartaaon ko lagata he ki aatankiyon ne hamalon ke bahut pehle se apane lakshyon kii toh lee he
 It added that a RAW official said that the chief of the team, Ismail, carried out reconnaissance with the help of the local people

 ’’ a few days ago, on the day of Eid, the Hafiz Saeed who had threatened to attack the Red Fort, now that the same Hafiz has killed himself in such a manner by saying that he is clean and clean
 uskaa kahana he ki wo aatankwaadi he hi nahin or wo apni begunaahi sabit karne ke liye jahaan joint kamishan ke saamne bhi pesh ho saktaa he
 It is understandable that no one laughed or cried at this latest statement of the world's most maligned and dreadful terrorist, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, but the politics of terror probably rises on the basis of such rhetoric
 tabhi to apane sir par ek karod america dollar kaa inaam liye ghoomanevaale is shaks ne ab ye nayaa shigupha choda he
 Humorous and humiliating, this person has not only surprised the Indian agencies, politics and politics by listening to the words of Pakistani independence i
e
 during a public meeting on November 14, but this thing has made the whole world Is startled
 haalanki jaananevaale jaanate hai ki is tarah kii bayaanbaji kaa matlab sirf apane samarthakon ke dil main jagah banane kii koshish ke alaava or kuch bhi nahin he
 At a rally organized by the terrorist organization jamaat-ud-dawa in front of the Punjab Assembly of Pakistan, Hafiz Saeed started a new debate by saying that he is not only innocent and clean, but also to prove his innocence
 For this, he is also ready to appear before any Judicial Commission, in which the Judicial Commission comprises the judges of both India and Pakistan countries
 haalanki samarthakon ko dekh kar josh main aayaa hafij said itane par bhi nahin rukaa
 He even said that if there is any evidence against him, Hindustan should prove him as a terrorist
 vaise pakistan ke kaam karne ke taur-tareekon kii khabar rakhanevaale hafij said kii in lambii-chaudee dingon se zyada hairaan nahin hai kyonki mumbai hamalaa yani 26-11 ke silsile main hindustan kii taraf se tamaam subut die jane ke baavjood naa sirf pakistan kii hai court balki supreme court ne bhi saal 2010 main hi said ko clin chit de rakhi he
 Pakistan's Supreme Court, ignoring all the evidence from India, said that it cannot allow the government to take any action against Saeed only on the basis of heard and speculated facts
 jaahir he, said kii ye tamaam baaten, vahaan kii sarkaar or adaalat kaa rukh kisi phixd match kii tarah he or yahi vajah he ki ab tak hindustan kii ore se said kii is nai shigufebaaji par koi tippanee nahin kii gai he
 Hafiz Saeed, who had asked Hindustan to prove himself a terrorist, had just a few days ago shown his true complexion by taking the lives of five Indian soldiers, but now he said that he should be involved in this incident, once again to attract the attention of the people
 Have tried, while the investigation so far, shows that the Pakistani army, on the instigation of Hafiz Saeed, entered the border of India on the night of August 5-6
 Be bloom had killed five soldiers
 pakistan ke punjab main jamaat-ud-daawa kii raily main haanki gai tamaam dingon ke alaava hafiz said ne ye bhi kaha ki wo haal hi main sarhad par hui golibari se pehle line of control tak nahin gaya tha, jabaki jin vakt uske elosi aane kii baat kahi ja rahi thi, tab wo ek masjid main takreer kar rahaa tha
 However, despite all his pleas of innocence, he did not desist from hindering the internal affairs of India
 usne kaha ki hindustan ko jammu-kashmir se fouj hataa leni chahie
 Well, not only in this month, even before this, on the instigation of Hafiz Saeed, Pakistan's soldiers beheaded two Indian soldiers but Saeed was neither silent before this nor stopped after this
 balki ab bhi wo puure pakistan main gum-gum kar hindustan ke khilaaf aag ugal rahaa he or ab khud ko begunaah bataanevaale hafiz said ne mahaj chand rose pehle hi hindustan main or khaas kar laal kile par dobaaraa aatankwaadi hamalaa karne kii dhamkee di thi
 Although Hafiz Saeed is a criminal in the eyes of the world and law, it can only be understood from this that all the big countries of the world as well as the UNO itself have declared him a terrorist and he is not just Hindustan Rather, America is included in the list of most wanted criminals
 hafiz said pakistani hukumat kaa wo mohara jiske dilo-dimag main har vakt agar kuch chaaya rahata he, to wo he hindustan
 The only difference is that his mind is filled with hatred for India only and in the tongue
 khaas baat ye he ki mumbai hamale kaa ye sabase bada gunahagaar hafiz said kabhi kashmir ke algaavvaadi netaa yaccin malik ko gale lagaataa he, to kabhi pakistani fouj ko uksaa kar hindustan ko lahuluhan karata he lekin tamaam antarrashtriya dabaavon ke baavjood wo pakistan main naa sirf khuleam ghumta he, balki kabhi jihad to kabhi kisi or bahaane se hindustan ko jakhmi karata he
 Hafiz Saeed's hatred against India has not increased, but this seed had fallen in his mind only when the two countries were divided
 bantwaare se pehle haryana kaa rahanevaale uske parivaar ke kai log dangon main maare gaye or iske baad se usne bas ek hi kaam chun liya or wo tha hindustan se dushmani
 But the world first heard the name of Hafiz Saeed when he laid the foundation of the terrorist organization lashkar-e-taiba under the flag of jamaat-ud-dawa with the help of ISI in 1990
 iske baad said ke ishaare par lashkar ne jammu-kashmir samet hindustan ke kai ilaakon main ek ke baad kai antkavaadi hamalon ko anjaam diya or har hamale ke saath said ko badanaami milti rahi
 When Hafiz Saeed's name also appeared with Maulana Masood Azhar in the attack on Parliament on 13 December 2001, he got another breakthrough in his cause
 iske baad 11 july 2006 ko mumbai ke train dhamaake or 26 / 11 ke mumbai hamalon ke peeche bhi said ke dimag kii baat saamne ai, lekin bharat uske khilaaf karrwai kii baaten karne ke sivaa or kuch bhi nahin kar sakaa
 The extent of this is that despite all the evidence, the Pakistani court acquitted Hafiz Saeed in this case
 iske baad said kaa hausala tha ki badhata hi gaya
 This year, he beheaded the Indian soldiers on the loc and now he has killed five soldiers, but despite this, no one can tell when the most wanted terrorist of India will be in the JD of India

 shanivaar shaam 5:00 baje yahaan chunaav prachaar khatm ho jayega
 For BJP, Ayodhya is not just a seat in the assembly but a symbol on which it has driven its chariot in the politics of the country
 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main jab bijepi ayodhya kii seat haar gai thi to sachmuch party kii naak cat gai thi
 The BJP had never lost the assembly seat of Ayodhya after 1991
 lekin pichhali baar pawan pandey ne ayodhya kii seat par bijepi ko haraakar samaajawaadee party kaa jhanda laharaa diya tha
 Akhilesh Yadav has once again placed bets on Pawan Pandey, who is often in controversy
 sapa kii ore se phir lard rahe hai pawan pandeshuukravaar kokhilesh yadav ndhyodhya main raily karke pawan pandey kii jamkar tarif kii or kaha kii phir se samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar banani he to pawan pandey ko jitakar bhejein
 Earlier on Thursday, Azam Khan had campaigned strongly in Ayodhya and appealed to the Muslims in support of Pawan Pandey that it is better to vote for BSP than that Muslims should directly vote for BJP
 is baar yodhya jeetne ko lekar samaajawaadee party kii chintaa bevajaah nahin he
 The Samajwadi Party needs the support of its Muslim voters to win back the seat of Ayodhya
 lekin ayodhya seat par mayawati ne aisa daanv khelaa he jaisaa kisi ne nahin aajamaaya
 BSP fielded Muslim candidate: After many decades, a big party has fielded a Muslim candidate on this seat
 bispi ke tikat par chunaav ladane vaale mohammad bazmi siddki peshey se property dealer hai or raajnneeti ke nae khilaadi hai

 In his election campaign, he reminds the Muslims that all the incidents from Muzaffarnagar riots to looting have taken place during the Samajwadi Party rule

 But the biggest identity of Ved Prakash Gupta is that he has contested both Samajwadi Party and BSP from this Ayodhya seat
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main vah bijepi ke ummidavaar the
 There is a lot of resentment among the BJP people for giving tickets to a Dal Badlu leader, leaving the party's old cadres
 khud veda prakaash gupta ko is naaraazgi kaa ehsaas he or wo chunaav prachaar main kehete hai ki ab unki ghar vaapasi ho gai he or ab kabhi bijepi chhodkar nahin jaaenge
 Sahara, not Ram's name, Modi's name
 When talking to BJP voters, he clearly says that he has to vote for Modi, not the candidate
 veda prakaash gupta ke samarthak ghar-ghar jaakar chunaav prachaar karte samay 'jai shriram' kii bajaay 'har har modi, ghar ghar modi' kaa naaraa lagaate hai
 The point is very clear, the candidates are also catching the wind and in this city of Ram also BJP has the support of Modi's name

 samooh or dal main kya antar hota he? iske liye hindi vyakaran kii kisi kitaab kii nahin balki sansad ke kanoonee praavdhaanon or paramparaon main jhaankne kaa vakt aa gaya he
 a normal political person should be interested in the topic of why the Congress leader is seeking the post of Opposition and why the government does not appear to be active on his behalf
 or kya ho jayega jab 16veen loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh nahin hoga
 Looking at the history, there was no opposition between 1952 and 1969
 saal 1969 main pehali baar congress sarkaar se nikal congress o banati he, jiske netaa ram subhag singh loksabhaa ke itihaas main pehali baar netaa vipaksh banate hai
 Ram Subhag Singh won elections from Buxar in Bihar
 iske baad saal 1980 or 89 ke bich bhi koi netaa vipaksh nahin tha, lekin saal 1989 se 2014 tak hameshaa netaa vipaksh rahaa
 In the debates related to democratic institutions, its development visits should also be taken care of and how the role of the leader and opposition is changing from 1952 till today
 kaise aaj kaa netaa vipaksh sadan ke bheetar sarkaar par najar rakhane ke alaava sadan ke baahar sarkaar ke kai faislon main bhagidaar banataa he, taaki janata ko yah yakeen dilaayaa ja sake ki sarkaar se swatantra hokar kaam karne vaali sanvaidhanik sansthaaon ke pramukhon kii niyukti paardarshee tareeke se kii gai he or sarkaar ne apane hiton kaa dhyaan rakhte hue niyukti nahin kii he
 These institutions are the Central Information Commissioner, Central Vigilance Commission, National Human Rights Commission, Lokpal, CBI and Election Commission
 ek sawaal yah he ki jab sarkaar lok sabha or rajya sabha ke prati uttaradaayi hoti he to kyon na in niyuktiyon ke praavdhaanon main loksabhaa ke saath rajya sabha ke netaa vipaksh ko bhi shaamil karnaa chahie
 Now come the two laws of 1977 and 1998 which are being discussed in this context
 donon main fark he
 The Act of 77 has written the Leaders of Opposition and the Act of 98 has written the recognition of the leader and Chief Whip of the parties
 98 ke act main netaa vipaksh shabd nahin he or na hi das pratishat kii shart he
 In 1977, the Janata Party government passed the Salary and Allowances of Leaders of Opposition Act for the first time
 iske anusaar pehali baar netaa vipaksh ko vaidhanik manyata cabinet mantri kaa darja, selary or anya suvidhaayen milti hai
 It states that the leader of the party with the highest number will be eligible for this post
 das pratishat vaali shart nahin he
 According to tradition, until 1969, when no leader was opposition due to not having equal members of the same ten percent quorum, then why did the Janata Party, which came into the government from the opposition in 1977 Act, replace the biggest party instead of ten percent
 hamaare aaj ke mehmaan suyarprakash ji ne likhaa he ki loksabhaa ke pehle spikar ji ve maavlankar kaa vichaar tha ki jab tak partiyon kii sankhya kam se kam na hogi loktantr sahi tareeke se viksit nahin ho saktaa
 According to Mavalankar, in order to be a parliamentary party in the Lok Sabha, a party should have its own ideology and programs, which should be announced before the elections and the organization should have a structure outside the House to keep in touch with the public opinion
 party ke paas sadan kii karrwai ke jaruri korum kii sankhya se kam sadsy nahin hone chahie
 You know that quorum in the house is one-tenth of the number of members
 loktantr main kitni partiyaan hon yah maavlankar ji ke apane vichaar ho sakate hai
 Not part of tradition or law
 maavlankar ji ne korum ke baraabar sansadeey dal kii manyata ke liye das pratishat kii baat kah kar ek parampara kii buniyaad daali
 The word Leader Opposition has not been used in his statement
 sansadeey dal kaa hua he
 The law did not even form a part
 mujhe yah gyaat nahin ho sakaa ki 1952 se 1969 ke bich kya kisi ne netaa vipaksh kii manyata ko lekar sawaal uthaaya tha
 Anyway, in this article of Suyaprakash ji, Mavalankar ji cites two conditions for being a parliamentary party, Congress fulfills one and not one
 congress ke paas akhil bhartiya dhaancha or vichaar to he hi
 No one has written in this regard, what was the stand of the Constituent Assembly regarding the Leader of the Opposition
 indian express main chape ek anya lekh main subhash kashyap ji bhi likhte hai ki spikar kisi netaa ko vipakshi netaa ke liye suvidha se lekar baithne kii jagah or bolne ke samay tay kar sakati hai
 But the speaker cannot remove the ten percent condition
 samvidhan visheshgy kashyap ke lekh se mere liye yah matlab nikaalnaa mushkil he ki kya vah yah kah rahe hai ki spikar 1977 ke act ke anusaar suvidhaayen de den
 If yes, then how can the speaker ignore the statutory recognition of the Leader of the Opposition in the same act
 agar kashyap ji yah nahin kah rahe hai to kya yah masalaa sirf staff or selary ko lekar hi he
 Subhash Kashyap has also written that if several opposition parties together cross the 10 percent limit it will be fraud with public exchequer
 kashyap ji sahi lagate hai kyonki 1977 or 1998 ke act main samooh yaa gathbandhan shabd kaa zikr hi nahin he
 He writes that the provision for appointment of heads of constitutional institutions can be changed
 lekin bijepi kaa to yahi aarope rahaa he ki congress ke vakt sanvaidhanik sansthaaon ke saath khilwaad hua he
 She will restore their sanctity
 ab congress kaise yah daawa kar rahi he
 When Jawaharlal Nehru did not show the generosity of giving recognition to the opposition, then on what basis does he expect the kindness of Prime Minister Modi
 nehru ko chhodiye
 Did Indira Gandhi recognize CPM winning 252 seats and any leader of Jana Sangh winning 22 seats in 1971 as Leader Opposition
 tathy he ki nahin di thi
 When Rajiv Gandhi got 404 seats, BJP got 2 seats
 us samay tidipi ko sabase adhik 30 siten ai thi
 Then why Rajiv Gandhi did not recognize TDP leader Madhav Reddy as Leader of the Opposition
 loktantr kaa ucchtam adarsh to yahi maang karata he ki sadan main do hi sadsy vipaksh main ho to usamen se kisi ek ko netaa vipaksh kii manyata deni chahie
 Those who doubt Narendra Modi can re-read his speech during the President's address, in which the Prime Minister assures the House that we do not run on the strength of numbers
 hamen samuhikta ke bal par chalanaa hoga
 We want to move forward with that sense of collectivity
 to imtahaan kiskaa he, pradhanmantri kii is bhaavana kaa loksabhaa ke praavdhaanon kaa yaa parampara kaa? According to a police official, eight motorcycle-borne gunmen fired indiscriminately on a bus at Safora Chorangi in gulistan-e-johar area in Karachi

 Jignesh Mevani, a lawyer and activist fighting for Dalit rights, alleges that the Patidar agitation is deliberately presenting false facts
 aisa sirf propaganda karne ke liye hi kiya ja rahaa he
 The truth is that even those who are rich are getting medical admission at 50 percent
 sirf paise ke dam par self finance kalege main management kota main pravesh mil rahaa he
 Although these facts are also not authentic, the fact that there is a very high percentage difference in medical admissions is not correct
 tippaniyan When asked about these facts, the emerging leader of the Patels, Hardik Patel, he gave a round answer
 unhone kaha ki yah to sirf is saal ke aankade hai, ve 2009 se puraane aankade pesh karenge
 Having said this much, he deferred further reply
 haalanki vah enditivi ke tathyon ko jhuthla nahin sake or kaha ki ve anya tathy saamne lekar aaenge
 Whatever the movement is, truth is necessary in the facts presented in it, or else credibility is questioned
 dalit adhikaar ke liye ladane vaale vakil or kaaryakarta jignesh mewaani kaa aarope he ki patidaar andolan main jaanboojhkar galat tathy pesh kiye ja rahe hai
 This is being done only for propaganda
 sachai yahi he ki jo amir log hai ve 50 pratishat par bhi medical main admishan paa rahe hai
 Only on the basis of money, self-finance college is getting admission in the management quota
 haalanki yah tathy bhi pramanik nahin hai, lekin medical pravesh main bahut zyada pratishat kaa antar hone kii baat sahi nahin he
 The comments in tathyon ke bare main jab patelon ke ubharate netaa hardik patel se poocha gaya to ve gol mol jawaab de gaye
 He said that this is only the figures for this year, he will present the figures from 2009
 itnaa kahkar ve aage kaa jawaab taal gaye
 However, he could not deny the facts of NDTV and said that they will bring other facts
 andolan koi bhi ho, usamen jo tathy pesh kiye jaaen unamem satyata jaruri ho jaati he, varanaa vishwasaneeyata par sawaal uthta he

 Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission, Allahabad was to complete the selection process by May 5 for 3,996 posts under 24 recruitments
 21 march ko ayog main sahaayak abhiyojan adhikari or allopathy chikitsadhikari padon ke liye intervyuu kii taiyaari chal rahi thi
 Then in the evening, Mukesh Secretary Rahul Bhatnagar's call came to the commission secretary Atal Kumar Rai
 iske baad sari gahamagahami shant ho gai
 The Chief Secretary gave a verbal order to immediately stop all the interviews in the Commission
 ayog ke afasaron ne likhit aadesh kii maang kii lekin koi jawaab nahin mila
 Instead of negotiating with the government, the commission thought it was more appropriate to stop the recruitment process
 haalanki ayog ke ek adhikari ne india today ko bataaya, ''agar sarkaar likhit aadesh karti to court ise radd kar detaa
 Article 317 of the country's constitution says that the State Government cannot do any investigation of the State Public Service Commission
 " is afasar se poocha gaya ki sarkaar ke paas adhikaar nahin tha phir bhi ayog ne sarkaar ke maukhik aadesh kaa paalan kyon kiya? jawaab mila ''hamane keval sarkaar kii galatfahami dur karne ke liye bhartiyon roki hai
 If the Commission did not stop hiring, then the wrong message would have gone
 "baari bahumat ke saath pradesh kii satta par kabiz hui bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar ke saamne apane us chunavi vaade ko puraa karne kii chunauti aa padi he jisamen usne pradesh ke chayan aayogon or board kii bhartiyon kii jaanch karaane kii baat kahi thi
 At present, the recruitment process of more than 50 thousand posts of recruitment boards including Public Service Commission, Secondary Education Service Selection Board, Higher Education Service Selection Commission, Subordinate Service Selection Commission has been stopped on the direction of the government
 naukari kii aas lagaae lakhon abhyarthi acroshit hai or agar sarkaar ne samay rahete rukii hui bhartiyon par koi nirnay nahin liya to puure pradesh main abhyarthiyon ke aakrosh kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Allahabad's Public Service Commission is no less than a place of pilgrimage for the aspirants who dream of going to the Civil Service on the purity of the Commission

 chaatro kii taraf se hycourt main pairokaar alok mishra kehete hai, ''ayog ke purv chairman anil yadav ke kaarykaal kii koi aisi bhartee prakriya nahin thi jisamen gadabadi kaa aarope lagaakar court main yachika daakhil na hui

 The case of changing the copy of Rae Bareli candidate Suhasini Bajpayee in the PCS-2015 main examination, strangled the Commission's image
 copy badal jane ke baad suhasini mukhya pariksha main fail ho gai thim lekin jab inaki asal copy janchi gai to ye intervyuu ke yogya nikaleen
 The issue was raised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Rohania rally in Varanasi on 6 March

 On the question of not being sacked by the Kalyan Singh-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Uttar Pradesh before the Babri demolition, Chandra said that if Rao sacked the BJP government and imposed President's rule there, the opposition parties would be attacked
 It would have been because Kalyan Singh had given affidavits to the Supreme Court and the National Integration Council, assuring the security of the structure

 # DDPD Ajay Devgn's film De De Pyar De (de De Pyaar De) is the story of 50-year-old Ajay Devgan who is separated from his wife
 ajay devgan ko 26 saal kii rakul preet se ishk ho jaataa he
 This unique love story flows throughout the boom
 ajay devgan apni is yuva saathi ke saath apni purv patni or bacchon ke paas pahunchataa he
 a strange story begins after that
 pehla half kuch hansaata he lekin duusare half main aisa lagata he ki diarector ko samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki jo raita unhone failaayaa he, use kaise samete
 The pace of the film becomes very slow
 screenple bhi behad kharaab he
 If we look at the acting front, Rakul Preet Singh manages to win the heart
 film kii jaan rakul preet singh hai or jab bhi ve screen par aati hai, darshakon ke chehre par chamak daud jaati he
 Tabu has done a good acting, but Ajay Devgn is not very involved in this role, and in the case of acting, he is seen out somewhere
 kul milakar unki acting bahut hi everej rahi he
 It can also be said that they seem misfit somewhere in this role, the direction of 'de De Pyaar De' is very weak and the story is also derailed
 haalanki film kaa sangeet jarur mjedaar he, or un songs par rakul preet singh ko dekhnaa vaaki acha anubhav he
 The connection connecting the youth in the film also appears to be missing
 aise main 'de de pyaar de (de De Pyaar De)' niraash karti he

 Supreme Court issues notice to the Centre Government on plea challenging the special status to J&K under article 370
 - ANI (@ani_news) August 8, 2017 Let us know what is Article 370 in ten points
 1
 Article 370 of the Constitution gives Jammu and Kashmir the status of a special autonomous state through temporary arrangements
 2
 The 370 was prepared in 1947 by Sheikh Abdullah, who was appointed Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Maharaja Hari Singh
 3
 Sheikh Abdullah argued about 370 that it should not be provisionally managed in the Constitution
 unhone rajya ke liye majboot swytta kii maang kii thi, jise centre ne thukraa diya tha
 4
 370 ke praavdhaanon ke anusaar sansad kojammu-kashmirake bare main raksha, videsh maamle or sanchaar ke vishay main kanoon banane kaa adhikaar he
 But to implement the law related to other subject, the Center needs the approval of the state
 5
 Due to this special status, Article 356 of the Constitution does not apply to Jammu and Kashmir
 raashtrapati ke paas rajya ke samvidhan ko barkhaast karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 6
 bharat ke duusare rajyon ke log jammu-kashmir main jameen nahin kharid sakate hai
 Citizens here have dual citizenship
 ek naagarikta jammu-kashmir kii or duusari bharat kii hoti he
 7
 yahaan duusare rajya ke naagarik sarkari naukari nahin kar sakate
 8
 bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 360 jisamen desh main vittiya apatkaal lagane kaa praavdhaan he, vah bhi jammu-kashmir par lagu nahin hota
 9
 anuchhed 370 kii vajah se hi jammu-kashmir kaa apana alag jhanda or pratik chinh bhi he
 10
 1965 tak jammu or kashmir main rajyapal kii jagah sadar-e-riyasat or mukhyamantri kii jagah pradhanmantri hua karata tha

 The field of Lok Sabha Election 2019 is getting ready and now the parties have started fixing the equation of their political arithmetic
 loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle ek ore jahaan vipaksh ek hokar rashtriya str par mahagathbandhan kii kavayadon main juta he, vahiin endie ko ek baad ek jatke mil rahe hai
 The RLSP, the party of Upendra Kushwaha, one of the major constituents of the NDA in Bihar, has given a jolt and is now ready to be part of the grand alliance with the RJD
 vahiin chunavi mausam vaigyanik ke taur par siyaasi galiyaaron main mashhoor ramvilas paswan (ramvilas Paswan) bhi ab siyaasi guna-ganit lagane main jute gaye hai or sutron kii maane to lojpa bhi bijepi ko jhatka de sakati he
 This is the reason why his party has also started doing pressure politics from BJP in NDA
 darasal, upendra kushvaha ke endie se alag hone ke baad lojpa ne bhi apane bagawati sur dikhaa diya he
 If sources are to be believed, Ram Vilas Paswan's son and MP Chirag Paswan has clearly given an ultimatum to the BJP to do something for the farmers and the poor and to politicize the issues
 ab paswan kii party kii BJP se nai maang- hamen jharkhand or upi main bhi seat den, vahaan bhi he hamaara votbandgar yah kaha jaae ki upendra kushvaha kii party ralospa (RLSP) ke NDA se agal hone ke baad rajg main ek or foot ke sanket dikh rahe hai, to katai galat nahin hoga
 Because Chirag Paswan himself has said that what he has tweeted on Tuesday has been done very thoughtfully
 darasal, sammanjanak siton ko lekar lok janashakti party ke saansad or ramvilas paswan ke bete chiraag paswan ne bhaajapa ko chetavanee dete hue kaha ki tidipi or ralospa ke endie se jane ke baad ab endie ganthbandhan najuk mode se guzar rahaa he
 At such a time, the concerns of the remaining partners in the Bharatiya Janata Party alliance should be removed in a timely manner with respect
 chiraag paswan ne BJP ko chetaya to upendra kushvaha bole- ham to NDA se baahar aa gaye, aap bhi aa jiecirag paswan ne ek or twit kar spasht kar diya ki endie main bijepi or unki party ke bich khinchataan kii vajah seat shering hi he
 Because Chirag Paswan said in the tweet that no concrete talks have been held on seats yet
 unhone twit kiya- gathbandhan kii siton ko lekar kai baar bhartiya janata party ke netao se mulaaqaat hui parantu abhi tak kuch thos baat aage nahin bad paayi he
 If the matter does not become available on time, it may cause harm
 'iske alaava, bihar endie main khinchataan ko isse bhi samajha ja saktaa he ki ramvilas paswan kii party lok janashakti party ne bhaajapa se maang kii he ki unhen jharkhand or upi main siten di jaaen
 Pashupati Paras, brother of party chief Ram Vilas Paswan, said, "we are asking for the same over which we have authority
" ham log endie ke eemaandaar partner hai
 We are asking for the same number of seats as were contested in 2014
 hamen jharkhand or uttar pradesh main siten chahien, kyonki hamaara votbank in rajyon main bhi he
 Time is running out
 ham chaah rahe hai ki amit shah is par 31 disambar tak faisla karen
 We want the BJP to maintain the sanctity of the alliance
 'haalanki, ralospa pramukh upendra kushvaha bhi chaahate hai ki lojpa endie se alag ho jaae or unke saath mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa ho jaae
 However, there are reports that Kushwaha may announce the decision to join the Grand Alliance in Delhi today
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki rajd netaa tejasvi yadav, hindustani avam morcha ke jithan ram maanjhi or congress ke ek pratinidhi kii maujuudagi main ek press conference kar kushvaha mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone kaa elaan kar sakate hai
 Opposition leader Sharad Yadav can also join the program
 buudhvaar ko lojpa ko ralospa pramukh upendra kushvaha ne endie se alag hone kii salaah di
 Rashtriya Lok Samata Party President Upendra Kushwaha has advised Chirag Paswan, 'lok Janshakti Party should break away from NDA alliance as soon as possible
 ye log choti partiyon ko barbaad kar dete hai
 We have come out
 acchhee baat yah he ki yah baat lojpa ko bhi samaj aa rahi he

 a post shared by Bali, Indonesia (@balilife) on Mar 17, 2019 at 3:22am PDT While objecting to Rajnath Singh's statement in the Lok Sabha, Congress leaders said that the Home Minister is trying to save his leaders
 congress mahasachiv digvijay singh kaa kahana he ki rajnath singh ko is masale par raajnneeti nahin kerani chahie
 He said why the leader of the Bharatiya Yuva Morcha was arrested if an unknown person threw a stone
 bhaajapa ke netaa is tarah khuleam kanoon apane haath main le rahe hai
 Action should be taken against them
 unhone kaha ki aajkal sabaki phone tanping ho rahi he
 SPG security personnel were attacked in Gujarat, Rajnath would not say anything on that
 unhone kaha, 'rajnath ko main bataa duun
 They are my friends, that their own phone is being tapped
 'vahi gujarat main maujuuda halaat par tippanee karte hai unhone bolaa ki shankar singh waghela ne ahamed patel ko dhokhaa diya he
 He was a big help by Congress leader Ahmed Patel
 maine bhi apil kii thi ki vah is tarah se dagaa na karen, par afsos kii baat he ki bhaajapa ke pralobhan main vah fanse hue hai
 According to Congress general secretary Madhusudan Mistry, the BJP is busy protecting its skin
 bhaajapa ke party ke youth wing ke leader ne pathar maaraa, usko sahi tehra rahe hai, jo pathar maare vah sahi he
 He said, 'there is no unknown person
 main aapako akhbaar ke clipings dikhaa rahaa hum
 All the newspapers have told how the leader of bjp's Yuva Morcha stoned, is Rajnath trying to save these people? Gujarat's Health Minister himself is involved in this whole case, arrest them
 jab mahatma gandhi kihatyahui tab ek vichaardhaara thi jisane gandhi ko maaraa yahi vah vichaardhaara he jisane rahul gandhi par pathar maaraa
 Why he is wandering through issues, is he not able to see that his party leader attacked Rahul Gandhi? vah apnichamadi bachaana chaahati he
 BJP is working to save him
 maharashtra main thane jile kii upabhokta adaalat ne ek bijli vitaran company ko aadesh diya he ki vah ek upabhokta ko galat bill bhejne ke liye 35 hajaar rupee kaa muaavja pradaan kare
 The court said in this case in the year 2008 that the complainant should get proper compensation for the mental problem caused to him due to a deficiency in the services of the company
 es di madaake kii adhyakshata vaale upabhokta vivaad nivaaran manch ne saat oktober ke apane aadesh main torant power limited ko yah bhi nirdesh diya ki vah bhiwandi ke kamtghar nivasee shikayatakarta rajendra jain ke flats kii kaati gai bijli pun: shuru kare
 The consumer forum accepted Jain's complaint that the company had issued him an incorrect bill on April 19, 2008, stating that the meter number was not related to him (the complainant)
 jain ne kaha ki company dwaara bijli aapurti kaate jane par unhen kiraye par doosraa flats lene ko majaboor hona padaa
 The power company denied the allegations and opposed the compensation application of three lakh and thirty thousand rupees

 - Prime Minister Modi said in the rally that we have taken a pledge for the security of the nation, this time the Congress and their allies are advancing with anti-national thinking
 congress kah rahi he ki J-K se dhara 370 se nahin hataayegi, congress ke dhakosla patr or pakistan kii bhashaa ek jaisi he
 The Congress is also talking to the separatists and Pakistan wants the same
 -pradhanmantri ne kaha ki congress deshadroh kaa kanoon hataane kii baat kah rahi he or maanavtaa kii baat kar rahi he
 But this Congress had taken away the right to vote from Bala Saheb, he should first see the mirror

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator If the new UGC reservation system is implemented for recruitment of teachers in BHU, then the Scheduled Castes (SC) seats will be reduced by 50 per cent, Scheduled Tribes (ST) seats by 80 per cent and OBC seats by 30 per cent
 yah kisi or kaa nahin balki khud banaras hindu uniwarsity (BHU) kaa anumaan he
 According to the Indian Express, according to the figures released by the university administration, as of May 12, 2017, the faculty had a total of 1,930 posts
 puraani aarakshan vyavastha lagu hoti to isamen se essi ke liye 289, asti ke liye 143 or obisi ke liye 310 siten hotin
 But according to the new reservation formula of UGC, 119 seats for SC, 29 seats for ST and only 220 seats for OBC will be reserved in the university
 kya he gadbansal main puraani aarakshan vyavastha main puure uniwarsity ko ek unit mana jaataa tha, lekin nai vyavastha ke mutabik ab kisi ek vibhaag ko ek alag unit ke taur par dekha jayega
 Granting reservation to a department as a unit means that SC / ST will not be able to get reservation in departments where one or two posts are vacant
 aise zyaadaatar post professor ke hote hai
 According to experts, in the new formula, in a department where two or more but less than 15 posts are vacant in a cadre, only one SC will get reservation on serial number 7 and only one ST on serial number 14
 is tarah kisi vibhaag main yadi assocatprofessorake 6 se kam pad khaali hai to unamem SC / ST ko koi aarakshan nahin mil paaegaa
 The benefit of reservation in these will be on the basis of rotation, which will take years
 centre sarkaar ne pichley maheene supreme court main daayar special live petishan (SLP) main uniwarsity ke isi anumaan kaa hawala diya he
 According to the order of Allahabad High Court, the new UGC formula is to be implemented
 lekin is aadesh ke khilaaf yachika main supreme court main sarkaar ne kaha he ki, 'isse arakshit varg kii siten kaaphi ghat jaaengi or kai vibhaagon main to puri tarah se saaf ho jaaengi, jisase unamem SC / ST samudaay kaa koi pratinidhitiv nahin bachegaa

 bajet satr ko badhaane kii sarkaar ke prastaav ko counter karne ke liye sonia gandhi ne vipaksh ke netaaon kii baithak bulaai he
 According to the information, this meeting has been called at 9:30 am on Tuesday
 is baithak main sarkaar ke satr badhaane ke prastaav ke khilaaf vipaksh ekajutata dikhayega
 It is believed that the strategy behind Sonia Gandhi's opposition solidarity is to stop the government from extending the session
 vipaksh kaa consarn yah he ki sarkaar bilon ko bina parliament scrootni ke paas karvaa rahi he bina uski detail main jaae hi bill paas kiye ja rahe hai
 The opposition says that the bills are neither sent to the Standing Committee or the Joint Committee
 balki sidhaa parliament main laakar bill paas karwaae ja rahe hai
 Which is not good in any sense
 vipaksh kaa aarope he ki sarkaar jaldbaaji main bilon ko paas karwaanaa chaahati he
 16 bills are pending for passing in Rajya Sabha and 10 bills in Lok Sabha
 udhar sarkaar kii koshish he ki satr badhaakar in bilon ko paas karvaa liya jaae
 But the opposition is not ready for this
 vipaksh nahin chahta he ki satr badhaayaa jaae
 While the government wants to increase the house by 10 days
 sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki yah sarkaar kaa adhikaar kshetra he ki vah satr ko kitne dinon ke liye chalaaya jaae or yah kitne avadhi kaa ho kyonki sarkaar ko dekhnaa he ki unke jo vidhaayi kaary hai, jo bill hai ve paas hon
 In the Business Advisory Committee headed by the Speaker, the government also proposed to the Opposition that the session be extended so that the remaining bills can be passed
 haalanki vipaksh iske liye taiyaar nahin hua
 The opposition opposed the government's proposal that it was against extending the session
 satr badhaane ke bare main sarkaar jaldi hi ek-do dinon main disijan legi lekin usase pehle hi sonia gandhi ne vipakshi partiyon kii meeting bulaakar saajha ranneeti banaakar sarkaar ke is prastaav kaa virodh karne kii yojana banaai he

 com / kgcr85ufwp The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has given full force to Maharashtra Assembly elections except Haryana
 dilli se kai rashtriya netaaon ko chunaav prabandhan ke liye maharashtra ke morche par lagaaya gaya he
 There are many reasons behind this
 darasal, haryana main bhaajapa ko raah aasaan lag rahi he, magar maharashtra main thodi mushkilen aa khadi hui hai
 bjp's fight in Maharashtra is not only with congress-ncp alliance, but inside is also with Shiv Sena
 bhaajapa ke ek netaa ne kaha, "desh ke har hisse kii tarah maharashtra main bhi vipaksh bhaajapa kaa muqabla karne kii sthiti main nahin he
 The truth is that our fight in Maharashtra is less than the opposition, more than the Shiv Sena
 "sutron kaa kahana he ki agar shivasena pichhali baar se zyada siten paane main safal rahi to vah sarkaar main apni hissedari ko lekar molbhav par utar aegi
 Apprehensive of this, the BJP is trying to reach the absolute majority figure alone
 yahi vajah he ki party ne maharashtra main puri takat jhonk di he
 Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant and Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya have consistently stuck in Maharashtra on the directions of the bjp's top leadership
 maurya maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke sah prabharee bhi hai
 Activism is such that the district level leaders of states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have been engaged in public relations campaign to get the votes of more than 40 lakh Hindi speaking, north-indians settled in Maharashtra
 sheersh netaaon kii baat karen to bhaajapa ke do rashtriya mahasachivon -bhupendra yadav or saroj pandeya- ne yahaan ek maheene se bhi adhik samay se deraa daal rakhaa he
 Bhupendra Yadav is in-charge of assembly elections in Maharashtra and Saroj Pandey is the state in-charge
 donon netaa rajya ke chunaav prabandhan main is kadar vyast hai ki is dauraan ve dilli aane ke liye bhi samay nahin nikaal paa rahe hai
 Bhupendra Yadav is usually deployed by the party in crisis-prone states
 aise main maharashtra main unki tainaati kii ahmiyat samajhi ja sakati he
 Talking about Union Ministers, senior party leaders Nitin Gadkari, Piyush Goyal and Smriti Irani are also giving a boost to the campaign in Maharashtra
 gadakari or irani ke str se ek din main kai reliyaan ho rahi hai
 The special thing is that BJP has engaged both its top officials for media management in Maharashtra elections
 isamen rashtriya media prabharee anil baluni or sah prabharee va bihar ke emelsi sanjay mayukh hai
 Whereas, National spokesperson Sudesh Verma is looking after media management in Haryana
 haryana kii baat karen to yahaan bataur vidhansabha chunaav prabharee kendriya mantri narendra singh tomars ellection management dekh rahe hai
 Here the party has appointed just one national general secretary, Dr
 anil jain ko morche par lagaaya he
 Jain is also in charge of the state
 sanghathan mahaamantri bi
 L
 santosh bhi bich-bich main haryana pahunchakar chunaav jeetne kaa mantra netaaon ko de rahe hai
 modi-shah and Rajnath Singh's rallies are happening in Haryana, but like Maharashtra, the national leaders are less in attendance here
 sutara bataate hai ki haryana main rasta aasaan dekh bhaajapa ne yahaan chunaav ladane main rashtriya netaaon se zyada sthaneey netaaon par hi bharosa jataayaa he
 Sources reveal that there are several reasons behind bjp's special focus on Maharashtra compared to Haryana
 ek to haryana main sirf 90 siten hai, vahiin maharashtra main 288 vidhansabha siten hai
 Secondly, there are more challenges in Maharashtra than in Haryana
 maharashtra main vipaksh kuch majboot he
 BJP is facing double challenges here
 ek taraf use congress-rakanpa gathbandhan se ladanaa he to duusari taraf seat bantwaare se lekar ab tak uski gathbandhan sahyogi shivasena se vibhinn masalon par nurakushti chal rahi he
 The BJP won 122 seats in all the 288 assembly seats separately when the alliance broke up in the 2014 assembly elections, while the Shiv Sena won only 63 while the Congress and NCP won 42 and 41 seats respectively
 purna bahumat se 20 siten kam hone ke kaaran tab bhaajapa ko shivasena ke samarthan se sarkaar banani padi thi
 This time the BJP is contesting only 150 seats in the 2019 assembly elections due to the alliance, while on 14 its other symbols are fighting on its own symbol
 jabaki shivasena 124 siton par chunaav lard rahi he
 In such a situation, the BJP feels that this time, due to contesting less seats, if less seats were won from last time and the Shiv Sena seats increased, then the BJP bank scam has created a new difficulty for the BJP
 kisaanon kii samasya pehle se party ko pareshaan kar rahi he
 Sources say that this is the reason why BJP has given full strength for Maharashtra Assembly elections

 ) Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram believes that the West Indies Cricket Board has made a huge mistake by not including explosive batsman Chris Gayle in the squad for the ODI and Test series against India
 akram kaa kahana he ki cricket board ke is kadam se gail kuch nahin khoyenge or keval mejabaan team hi kamjor hogi
 Significantly, Gail has been left out of the series against India due to a dispute with the board over a radio interview
 is saakshaatkaar main gail ne board par chotil hone ke samay majdhaar main chhodane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Akram said, 'not only performance but discipline is also very important
 lekin ipel jaise lubhaavne twanti-20 toornament kii maujuudagi kii vajah se agar gail westeindies ke liye phir kabhi bhi nahin khelte hai to vah kuch nahin khoyenge
 He said, "we all saw what a brilliant player he is while playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore during IPL-4
 vah kuch over main match kaa pasa palat saktaa he
 So i think West Indies cricket will lose a lot by not picking Gayle
