 i am in favor of adding young players and new faces to the team, but a mix of youth and experience is necessary rather than bypassing seniors

 ) loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi or endie ne to aitihaasik jeet darj kii hi he
 Exit Poll of Aaj Tak, the country's number one news channel, has also won
 aaj tak-exis maai india ne desh kaa sabase bada agsit pole kiya tha
 In this, his opinion was taken from more than 7 lakh 42 thousand voters
 isamen 95 fisadi se bhi zyada anumaan rigelt main badale
 Not only the seat, but the voting percentage was also very close to the result
 jin siton par agsit pole main taff fite kaa anumaan jataayaa gaya, vahaan jeet kaa margin bhi behad kam rahaa
 In Aaj Tak's exit poll, the BJP was projected to get more than 2014 seats
 hua bhi thik vaisaa hi
 The BJP managed to win more than 300 seats
 seat kaa anumaan 339 se 365, milin 350 se zyadaajtak exis maai india ke agsit pole main endie ko 339 se 365 siten milane kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya tha or upie ko 99 se 108 siten di thim
 Now the final result has confirmed the exit poll of Aaj Tak
 23 taarikh kii raat 12 baje tak NDA 348 siton par or upie 94 siton par badhat liye hue the
 While 100 seats are seen in the account of others
 upi main siton kaa anumaan bilkul sateek niklaajtak-exis maai india ke agsit pole main uttar pradesh main espi-bispi-areldi gathbandhan ko 10 se 16 siten, jabaki bijepi or anya ko 59 se zyada siten milane kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya tha
 Now in result, BJP alliance got 64 seats in UP, Mahagathbandhan got 10 seats and Congress got just 1 seat
 yani upi main bhi ajtak kaa agsit pole final nateezon se match kar gaya
 The voting percentage was correct, according to the Exit Poll, in UP, BJP was expected to get 48 percent, Congress 8 percent and the Grand Alliance 39 percent
 antim parinaam ke ye behad kareeb niklaa
 49
 6 fisadi bijepi ke paksh main voting hui he
 Congress 6
 3% vot mili hai
 The Grand Alliance has got close to 39 percent of the vote
 bihar kaa Exit Poll bhi 100% sahibihar kaa agsit pole bhi antim parinaam ke lihaaj se 100% sahi rahaa
 In the exit poll, the NDA estimated 38 to 40 seats here
 hua bhi yahi
 This time, the RJD has been completely washed away
 congress ko ekmaatr kishanganj kii seat par jeet naseeb hui he
 The Congress was projected to get 0 to 2 seats
 bengal main BJP ko 19-23 siton kaa tha anumaanyahi nahin, agsit pole main pashchim bengal ke andar tiemasi ko bijepi se kadi takkar milane kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya tha
 Aaj Tak had projected TMC to get 19-22 seats and BJP 19-23 seats in exit polls
 is graph par kai logon ko yakeen nahin hua tha
 But the final results confirmed Aaj Tak's exit poll
 madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh kaa sabase sateek Exit pollsirpa upi or bengal hi nahin, ajtak ke agsit pole har bade or chote rajya main sateek sabit hue hai
 Then whether it is projected to get 26-28 seats for BJP in Madhya Pradesh and 1 to 3 seats for Congress, or there are signs of BJP getting 7 to 8 and Congress 3 to 4 seats in Chhattisgarh, or Rajasthan's 25 The bjp's tally is expected to be in 25 seats
 dilli, uttarakhand or himachal main bhi clin swipadilli kii 7 siten, himachal kii 4 or uttarakhand kii paanchon siton par agsit pole main bijepi ke clin sweep kaa andaja tha
 Exit polls in these three states proved to be 100 percent correct
 teenon rajyon main bijepi ne sari siten jeet leen
 In Maharashtra and Gujarat, it was a clean sweep Exit Poll In the exit poll, bjp-shiv Sena in Maharashtra had estimated 38 to 42 seats, in Gujarat BJP got 25 or 26 out of 26 seats
 parinaam bhi agsit pole ke kareeb rahaa he
 When Aaj Tak's Axis My India exit poll came out, some critics rejected it
 kuch logon ne avishwasaneey aankada bataaya, or kuch ne ped agsit pole bataaya
 But now when the results and exit poll are around, then the confidence of the people of the country on Axis My India has deepened
 survey karne vaale pradeep gupta bole- sateek sawaal he safalataa kaa rajexis maai india ke CMD pradeep gupta kaa kahana he ki survey main sateek sawaal poochne ke liye jo ham prashikshan dete hai, vah hamaari safalataa kaa pramukh hissaa he
 More than 500 people work in the field to carry out the survey
 yah ek badi takat hamaare paas he
 If there is a mistake in the survey, we try to correct it immediately
 kya tha duusare sansthaanon kaa agsit polayahi nahin, duusare media sansthaanon ke mukaable ajtak exis maai india kaa agsit pole is baar bhi zyada sateek rahaa he
 In the exit poll of news18-ipsos, the NDA had projected 336 seats, UPA 82 and others 124 seats
 vahiin News 24 or today chanakya kaa agsit pole lagbhag parinaam ke kareeb rahaa he, News 24 today chanakya ne NDA ko 350 siten, upie ko 95 or anya ko 97 siten milane kaa anumaan lagaaya tha
 Apart from this, republic-c Voter had projected 287 seats to NDA, 128 to UPA and 127 seats to others
 Times now-vmr ne apane agsit pole main endie ko 306, upie ko 132 or anya ko 104 siten di thim
 In the exit poll of ABP-AC Nielsen, NDA was projected to get 277 seats, UPA 130 and others 135 seats
 jabaki India TV-CNX ne apane agsit pole main endie ko 300, upie ko 120 or anya ko 122 siten di thim
 Modi's magic was predicted by Pradeep Gupta, CMD of Axis My India, that the results that have come in Uttar Pradesh do not meet the expectations of the Grand Alliance
 lekin 'ajtak' ke agsit pole ke anumaan par solah aane khare utre hai
 According to Pradeep Gupta, the magic of PM Modi was projected in the exit poll of Aaj Tak Axis My India
 modi kaa vaisaa hi jaadu ek baar phir desh par chal gaya he
 In this sense, it is also a victory of Aaj Tak's exit poll, which is a symbol of the trust of crores of viewers of Aaj Tak
 raajnneetik vishleshkon ko bhi nahin thi ummid'ajtak' ne agsit pole main jo anumaan lagaae the, wo final nateezon se puri tarah match kar gaye, jo is baat kaa pramaan hai ki desh kaa number van news channel vishwasaneey agsit pole karne main bhi sarvshereshth he
 In fact, when big political analysts did not expect the Bharatiya Janata Party to return to power again with such a strong majority, 'aaj Tak' had projected the Modi wave in its exit poll and once again inundated the opposition
 The fear of falling mouth was expressed

 vahiin in sab ke bich bharat ke hisse main sirf 2 medal aae
 While there is satisfaction in this country that Sakshi Malik and PV Sindhu did not let the bag of India remain empty, at the same time there is dissatisfaction about whether this country with a population of one hundred and fifty crores is only two Does Medal Deserve? Some are cursing the players and some are following the minister
 darasal, yah vakt mantri ji yaa khilaadiyon ko gaali dene kaa nahin, balki apni galatiyon ko durust karne kaa he
 The dream of Olympic medal cannot be fulfilled overnight, it requires not one but many things to be corrected
 1
 There is a separate ministry to take care of sports and sportspersons in India
 sports athurity of india khelon ko badhaava dene ke liye kaam kar rahi he
 The Ministry of Sports is allocated a budget of thousands of crores every year
 sawaal uthta he ki ye paise aakhir kharch kahaan ho rahe hai? kya wo paisa sahi jagah par lag bhi rahaa he? is olympic main medals kii sankhya dekhakar to yah lagata nahin! aisa nahin he ki ye samasya aaj kii he
 Even before this, as many governments have been, no one has given any special preference to sports
 to aap kaise ummid kar sakate hai ki yah desh cricket ke alaava kuch or bhi khele
 Many times there was a smell of corruption in different associations
 kya hamaare khel mantralay ne us par karrwai kii? kya usase sabak liya? kya khel mantralay kaa jimmaa kisi aise shaks ko saunpa gaya jinhen khelon kii jaankaree ho? zyaadaatar sawaalon kaa jawaab shaayad naa he
 2
 khel bajet badhaane kii jarurat, training, koching or neutrishan kaa jimmaa uthaae sarkaarye baat sach he ki aaj bhi lagbhag aadha bharat kuposhan kaa shikaar he
 More than half the population is such that there is no meat to eat pure and nutritious
 yues, britain, australia, china kii tulana main hamaara physic kamjor he or ham unase campit nahin kar paa rahe hai
 This is because athletes in our country do not have enough money to be able to follow the Proper Diet Plan
 aise main sarkaar kii jimmedaari banati he ki wo khel bajet ko badaye, taaki rashtriya str ke khilaadiyon ke khaane pine se training tak kaa jimmaa uthaaya ja sake
 Players' facilities can be improved by increasing the budget
 antarrashtriya str ke coach rakhe ja sakate hai jinaki nigaraanee main hamaare athleates taiyaari kar sakate hai
 3
 sports athurity of india ko neend se jaagnaa hogaajab-jab olympic yaa koi bada event aata he tab-tab hamaare associations kii neend khulti he
 Then the hunt for athletes begins in a hurry and hurry
 olympic main kharaab pradarshan ke baad do-chaar gaaliyaan sunakar sports athurity of india phir se kumbhkarna kii neend so jaataa he
 Actually there is a need to remove this laxity
 agar bharat ko khel jagat main kuch acha karnaa he desh main sports culture develop karnaa aavashyak he
 For this, the Sports Ministry will have to keep a close watch on the Sports Authority of India whether appropriate arrangements are being made for the players at the national, state and district levels
 Are facilities reaching players at lower levels? The work will not be done just by sitting in AC rooms, villages and small towns have to be reached to bring talent forward
 4
 Sports have to be preferred at the school and college level
 In today's time, sports has become a very big opportunity to make a career
 ek samay tha jab collejon se rashtriya str ke bade khilaadi nikalate the lekin aaj wo parampara lagbhag khatm hoti si dikhaai de rahi he
 Students have to be encouraged towards sports in schools and colleges
 zyaadaatar skulon main aajkal sirf cricket ko hi sports mana jaataa he, is soch ko badalane kii jarurat he
 Schools and colleges are the platforms from which the search for international level star can be completed
 skool or collejon main cricket, footbal, hockey or tennis ke saath saath athletics, raceling, shooting, swimming, jimnastic or trek and field jaise anya events ko bhi badhaava dena hoga
 For this, appointment of Specialist Sports Education Teacher is required in every school
 5
 Cannot leave everything to the government, sports will have to be made an important part of life
 It is a strange irony of our country that even a middle class family here considers it disrespectful to do their own work
 agar kisi ko ek gilaas pani chahie, to wo unka naukar laakar degaa
 He himself cannot work hard
 yah maansikta badalane kii aavashyaktaa he
 It is absolutely true that not every human being can play for India, but is there any harm in keeping oneself fit? If every person only makes sports a part of his daily routine for his fitness, then the coming generations will themselves become stronger and healthier
 khelon kii badahaal sthiti ko badalane ke liye sports culture develop karnaa aaj ke samay kii maang he
 At the same time, voluntary organizations and other social organizations will have to spread awareness at the lower level to arouse the interest of youth towards sports
 gaanvon, kasbon or shaharon main choti-choti pratiyogitaayen yojit kerani hogi
 Despite the lack of facilities and identity, many players came to the Rio Olympics from an anonymous village or small town
 kehete hai badlaav raaton raat nahin aati
 It requires years of hard work
 agar aaj sarkarein, associations, sansthaaen or ham milakar mehnat karen to shaayad aane vaale kuch hi saalon main bhartiya khelon kii kismat badal jaaegi
 There is a very famous saying in India 'read will write, you will become Nawab, you will jump, you will be bad', Sakshi Malik and crores of money on PV Sindhu have proved this to be absurd

 He used to take a cancellation check in the name of getting a loan from the bank
 lekin liter kii aanch main use blank check bana dete or phir apana naam or rakam bhar kar use bhunaa lete the
 By this magical trick he has cheated millions so far
 lekin ab unka raaj khul chukaa he or pahunch gaye hai salaakhon ke peeche
 In June, a man lodged a complaint with Dadar police station that someone had withdrawn 80 thousand rupees from his bank account
 dadar police ne jaanch kii to pataa chalaa ki jis check se rupee nikle the usapar baqayada shikayatakarta ke dastakhat the
 When the complainant was asked, he told him to give the check to the agent for taking the loan
 lekin jab agent ko phone kiya gaya to wo band tha
 It did not take long for the police to understand that the agent had cheated
 lekin bada sawaal tha ki cancel kiya hua check kaise paas hua? However, while tracing the location through phone number, the police arrested one tax agent Kalpesh Tambe, Srimant Bhosle and Manoj Mishra
 uske baad jo raaj khulaa to police bhi dang rah gai
 According to Mahesh Patil, the Deputy Commissioner of Police of the area, these vicious thugs would stand outside banks and identify people who wanted to take loans
 phir unhen aasaani se lone dilaane kaa jhansa dekar khate main kam se kam ek lakh rupaya hone kii shart rakhte, saath hi unase cancel check dene ko kehete
 This is common in the loan process, so no one refuses

 phir check lekar ye kahkar nikal jate ki kuch dinon main aapke acount main lone kii rakam diposit ho jaayegi
 But the opposite happens, the account would be cleared
 phir naa wo milte or naa hi unka phone number lagata

 Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi has said that there should be an attempt to end the arguments in this case by October 18, otherwise the decision may be postponed
 ab itane bade maamle kii sunwaayee puri hona, phir kam samay main faisla likhaa janaa kisi chamatkaar se kam nahin hoga or itane kam samay main in sabhi baton ko puraa karnaa ek chunauti hi hogi

 Despite more than two years of the central government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concern about the plans not being able to get completely off the ground has increased

 In the UP elections, people will ask for the promises

 Nearly half the term of the Modi government has come to an end

 It will be sent to implement all bjp-ruled states

 Four-time Lok Sabha MP and former cabinet minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has emerged as the front runner of the leader of the Congress party in the Lok Sabha amid changes in the Congress and efforts to bring new faces forward
 sutron ke mutabik, haal hi main loksabhaa main congress ke netaa mallikarjun khadge ko loksabhaa kii lok lekha samiti kaa chairman bana diya gaya he, jisko cabinet ministar kaa darja praapt he
 Prior to this, Mallikarjun Kharge, leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, could not get the status of Leader of the Opposition, away from the figure of 55 mps in the Lok Sabha
 aise main party kaa maananaa he ki khadge kaa ek tareeke se pramotion ho chukaa he
 In such a situation, a new appointment has to be made as the leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha
 haalanki is pad par aane vaale ko cabinet ministar kaa darja pehle kii hi tarj par nahin hoga
 According to sources, after deep consideration in this, the names of Jyotiraditya Scindia and Kamal Nath emerged
 iske saath hi loksabhaa main congress ke nae netaa kaa maamla madhya pradesh main party kii kaman par bhi ulajh gaya
 After all, the priority of both has been the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh
 aise main kai daur kii baithkon ke baad kuch ahm tathy ubharkar saamne aaye hai
 
 
 1
 umr ke hisaab se kamalnath ke paas takreeban aakhri mauka he, saath hi tamaam koshish ke baavjood ab se pehle unako kabhi bataur siem cheharaa nahin banaaya gaya
 2
 kamalnath empi main digvijay singh, kantilal bhuriya, arjuna singh ke bete ajay singh or suresh pachori sareekhe netaa ko saadh sakate hai, ye tamaam netaa sindhiya se varisht bhi hai
 3
 pichley chunaav main aakhri vakt ke liye hi sahi lekin sindhiya ko bataur siem cheharaa pesh karke hi chunaav ladaa tha, tab unako campagne cameti kaa chairman banaaya gaya tha
 4
 loksabhaa main rahul ke saath hamaumr sindhiya philhal zyaada behatar ho sakate hai
 But the other side is that Kamal Nath has more Lok Sabha experience
 jisase loksabhaa main rahul ko madad or phayda ho saktaa he
 According to the formula prepared in such a situation, it seems quite possible for Scindia to become the leader of Congress in Lok Sabha instead of Kharge
 is surat menkamalnathka madhya pradesh congress kii kaman sanbhaalane ke bhi prabal asaar hai
 According to sources, if everything goes well, a decision will be taken soon
 aise main agar rahul ne vito nahin lagaaya to sonia or tamaam badeneta kamalnathko madhya pradesh kii kaman or sindhiya ko loksabhaa main party kaa netaa banane ke haq main hai
 But overall it is certain that these two leaders of Madhya Pradesh are to be appointed on these two big posts of the party, one in Delhi, one in MP
 vaise rahul loksabhaa main vipaksh kaa netaa nahin bananaa chaahate
 Because he has to become the president of the party and Rahul does not want a leader to break the principle of one post Rahul himself
 vaise itihaas gavaah he ki sonia jab raajnneeti main ain thim to unhone sharad pavaar ko loksabhaa main congress kaa netaa banaaya tha
 However, the then Congress leader in the Lok Sabha had the status of a cabinet minister as the leader of the opposition

 media reports ke mutabik, ravi naam kaa ek 26 saal kaa ye fain, garment factory main kaam karata tha
 Ravi was cruising outside actor Yash's house for a long time
 baar baar koshishon ke baad bhi ravi ko KGF star ke ghar main ghusane nahin diya gaya
 It is being said that he wanted to meet Yash
 jab fain, actor se milane main kaamyaab nahin hua to usne actor ke ghar ke baahar hi khud par petrol daalkar or aag laga lee
 The people present at the time of the incident controlled the fire with blankets and admitted Ravi to Victoria Hospital
 lekin hospital le jane tak kaaphi der ho chuki thi
 Ravi's body was burnt to about 70 percent
 aakhirkaar uski maut ho gai
 Let me tell you that every year Ravi used to go outside Yash's house and take selfie with him
 is saal diggaj actor ambarish (ambareesh) ke nidhan kii vajah se yash neberthdecelebratt nahin kiya tha
 Due to which the actor could not meet his Jabra fan
 suicide ke bare main pataa chalane ke baad yash aspataal gaye the
 He consoled Ravi's family

 unhone kaha- ''ravi aakhri baar bhiyashake bare main hi baat kar rahaa tha
 While we were dressing her wounds, Ravi asked if Yash would come to see me? Rape is a dark word
 Let's not water it down to describe a brutal gym session or a bad day at work or with a joke

 Dear Jim Sarbh / Kangana Ranaut Rape jokes are not funny
 Rape is NOT a joke
 If you tell or laugh at jokes about rape you are a part of the problem

 However, there is no report of any loss from this
 darasal, maharashtra ke thane jile ke kalyaan main ‘padmavat’ dikhaa rahe ek cinema theatre ke baahar shanivaar raat agyaat shararti tatwon ne petrol bam phenk diya
 Kalyan police said that there was no report of any injury in the incident
 yah ghatana raat nau bajkar das minute par bhaanu sagar theatre ke baahar hui
 He said that a team of police has reached there for investigation
 sanjay lila bhansaali nirdeshit ‘padmavat’ nirmaan ke samay se hi rajput sanghathanon ke nishane par he
 They are accusing the film of tampering with history
 jabaki, film dekhne vaale logon kaa kahana he ki isamen aise kisi drishy ko nahin darshaya gaya he jisase rajputon ko thes pahunche
 Here, Karni Sena said on Saturday that if it is handed over the rights to the film 'padmavat' then it is ready to pay the expenses incurred on making this film
 saath hi usne is film ke relies hone par desh main hui hinsak ghatnaon main apana haath hone se spasht inkaar kiya
 Karni Sena chief Lokendra Singh Kalvi said that his members or any other Kshatriya organization had no hand in the attack on the school bus
 bataa den ki buudhvaar ko gudgaanv main ek bheed ne 20-25 bacchon ko le ja rahi ek skool bas par hamalaa kiya tha
 Violent protesters set fire to vehicles and damaged public property in protest against the film 
 kalvine kaha ki ahmedabad main hui hinsa se unke sanghathan ke sadasyon kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Vehicles were vandalized outside malls in Ahmedabad
 unhone kaha ki in hamalon ke peeche film se jude hue logon kaa haath he
 He said, 'if he (bhansali) hands over the rights to the film then we are ready to collect the money and give it to him
 ham film ke reel kaa johar karenge (jala denge)
 ' vaise to gujarat main loksangit ke jalson main kalakaaron par lakhon rupee nyochhavar karne kaa chalan pehle se he lekin notebandi ke baad lagaataar aa rahi aisi tasviren logon ko achambhit karti hai
 The question is, when people in rural areas have to spend hours in lines to withdraw four thousand rupees a week, then where are so many notes coming from to blow on artists? On receipt of notes of few lakh rupees, the Income Tax also inquires, then how are such incidents going on? bainkon ke atm abhi bhi band hai or saamaajik jalson main lakhon ke note kalakaaron par udaae ja rahe hai
 The question arises whether the incident of blowing so much money will ever be investigated
 Where are the notes coming from to fly in such waters, this should also be the subject of investigation

 desh ke navnirvaachit raashtrapati ramnath kovind padbhaar grahan karne ke baad apni pehali yatra jammu-kashmir ke ladakh rigen main kar sakate hai
 Kovind will be the 14th President of the country and with this he will also become the Supreme Commander of the three armies
 sutron ke mutabik kovind raashtrapati banane ke baad sabase pehle ladakh jaakar vahaan sena kaa manobal badha sakate hai
 According to army sources, preparations have been started on his behalf and it is expected that soon Kovind's office will get the green signal
 ladakh rigen samrik drushti se bharat ke liye bahut mahatvapurn mana jaataa he kyonki ye purv main jahaan china ke saath seemaa saajha karata he to pashchim main iske pakistan he
 Kovind's move to Ladakh after his victory is also important because India's relations with China are not going well at the moment and there is an atmosphere of tension between the armies of the two countries in the Sikkim region on the issue of Doklam

 The famous playback singer Singershweta Pandit has alleged harassment
 unka kahana he ki jab ve 15 saal kii thim tab anu malik ne recording studio main unkaheracementkia tha
 Shweta shared her objection through Twitter post
 unhone likhaa- ''ye saal 2000 kii baat he jab main film mohabbatein main bataur lead singer launch hui thi
 i was called by Anu Malik's then-manager Mustafa
 mujhe andheri ke empire studio main bulaayaa gaya
 " # metoo: Vinata arrives at the police station after 19 years, reprimanding Alok Nath from court"
 When me and my mother arrived at the studio, they were recording a group song with Shaan and Sunidhi for the film Awara Pagal Deewana
 unhone mujhe bina mujeec ke gaanaa gane ko kaha
 Then i sang the song "har dil jo pyar karega"
 iske jawaab main anu malik ne kaha, main tumhen ye gaanaa sunidhi or shaan ke saath duungaa lekin iske liye tumhen mujhe abhi kis karnaa hoga
 i was shocked
 ''had to go back to my worst memory as a teenage girl today to write this and speak up - its now or never

 ''' shweta ne singersona mahapatrako anu malik kii harkaton ko saamne laane ke liye shukriya kaha he
 Let me tell you, Sona had described Anu Malik as a perpetrator (serial predator)
 sona se kabhi nahin mila- anu malikwahin, sona ke aaropon kaa jawaab dete hue anu maalik ne kaha tha, "maine kabhi sona ke saath kaam nahin kiya he
 Haven't even met him
 unka matlab kuch aise cese se he jo bahut pehle hue the
 i have nothing to do with them
 main is par kuch bhi tippanee nahin karnaa chahta hum
 She is just pulling my name
 " Smriti Iraniko has held the post of minister for only six months, but many controversies have arisen regarding her
 bhagava party kaa gupt agenda aage badhaane ke aaropon se lekar dilli uniwarsity ke chaar varshiya snaatak course (epaviupi) or kendriya vidyalayon main german-sanskrit bhashaa jaise kai vivaadon main unka naam surkhiyon main rahaa he
 She told her Associate Editor Anubhuti Vishnoi and Chief Correspondent Santosh Kumar that she is just following the rules and following the consensus policy of all parties on education
 unase hui baatcheet ke mukhya ansh:kaarybhaar sanbhale hue chah halchal bhare maheene ho chuke hai, maanav sansaadhan vikaas jaise mahatvapurn mantralay kii mukhiya ke rup main aapkaa anubhav kaisaa rahaa he?kul milakar dekhen to meri yatra sirf chah maheene kii nahin, balki 38 saal kii ho chuki he or vah bahut rochak rahi he
 When i came in the ministry, i told everyone that if you take education as a challenge, then you will just keep battling with it
 agar aap ise maukey ke rup main lenge to puraane dharre se hatakar kuch nayaa soch paaenge or sambhavat: koi nayaa rasta nikaal paaenge
 Although people believe that there is politics in education, but after talking to people of different parties, i found that there is a consensus on the three main issues
 pehla, hamaare sabhi bacchon ko shiksha milani chahie
 Second, quality education should be available to all children and students
 or teesraa, jo shiksha hamen mili, vah hamen maujuuda sthitiyon ke anuroop hi nahin, balki bhavishya ke liye ek pragatisheel rasta dikhaa sake
 i work only keeping in mind the atmosphere of consensus
 dilli vishvavidhyalay ke chaar varshiya paathyakram vivaad ko aap kis tarah dekhati hai, jo aapke mantri banate hi shuru ho gaya tha or press main aapaki kaaphi nakaaratmak chhavi ban gai thi
 My entire focus has always been on how an issue affects students
 aise 44 course the, jinhen bharat ke raashtrapati kii kanoonee manjuuri hasil nahin thi
 There were courses whose names were rejected by the regulatory body UGC and around 70,000 students were studying these courses, even though they knew that these courses had no legal validity
 isliye mere saamne chunauti thi ki kya main yah jaanate hue nayaa seshan shuru hone duun ki 70,000 chaatr jin 44 corson main naam likhavane vaale hai, ve kanoonee rup se vaid nahin hai yaa phir anjaan banane kaa naatak karun taaki press khush rahe
 a student who earns degree after four years of hard work at Delhi University and later realizes that his degree is not valid, then what would have passed on him would have been far more painful
 aam dharna yah he ki aapane kendriya vidyalayon (kevi) main teesri bhashaa ke rup main german kii padhai par kadaa rukh akhriyaar kiya
 
 
 As a cabinet minister and chairperson of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, i could not sign a document that violated the principles of the Constitution
 yah aisi chunauti he jo meri viraasat kaa hissaa he
 
 
 It is very unfortunate that the MOU (with the Gothe Institute for the Study of German Language in KV) was signed without adequate deliberation
 bahut-se logon ne aarope lagaaya he ki videshi bhashaaon ko padhaane kii anumati nahin di ja rahi, jo ki galat he
 Chinese, Japanese, French languages are being taught in the central schools and we have said that similarly German should be taught as a foreign language
 bahut-se log is baat ko samajhnaa hi nahin chaahate or ise galat tareeke se pesh kar rahe hai
 i have only said that German cannot be taught as the third language of India, which is a real, statutory and constitutionally correct decision
 seshan ke bich main aisa karne se chaatro ko mushkil nahin hogi?yah emoyu kuch is tarah sin kiya gaya tha ki isaki avadhi seshan ke bich main hi khatm ho rahi thi
 The only option i had was to either sign the agreement for the next three years or deliberately violate the law or terminate the agreement in the middle of the session
 isse prabhavit hone vaale chaatr kaksha chah se aath tak ke hai
 There are no board exams, so they will be assessed in the school itself
 pehali baat, yah sirf sanskrit kii baat nahin he, samvidhan ke anuchhed 8 main darj kisi bhi bhashaa ko chunaa ja saktaa he
 We have kept in mind the teaching and counseling in addition to the needs of the students
 jin chaatro kii german padhgaye kii ichha he, ve ise videshi bhashaa ke rup main pard sakate hai
 We have changed only this process
 shiksha main bhagavakaran ke aaropon par kya kahana he? sanskrit saptaah shuru karne ke aapke faisle kii kaaphi aalochana hui he
 Why criticism for giving importance to an Indian language? i also conducted essay competition in 22 languages
 shuru kii niabandh pratiyogitaaon main ek pingali venkaiya par thi, jo congress ke netaa the
 We accepted applications for this in Telugu, English and Hindi
 kya andhra ko praathamikta dene ke liye meri aalochana hui? main sochati hum ki mujhe lekar vivaad isliye khadey kiye jate hai ki usase khub prachaar miltaa he
 Many institutions have no head and their appointments are still pending
 koi bhi niyukti un padon kaa vigyaapan dene ke baad khoj or chayan samitiyon ke madhyam se hoti he
 Can i impose myself on those committees? i can not do that
 is prakriya ko tej kiya gaya he, prakriya puri hone main samay to lagata hi he
 Institutions have not had their heads since 2010 and 2011
 mujhe mantri bane hue abhi sirf chah hi maheene hue hai
 Interestingly, no question was ever asked as to how these organizations have been running without a head from 2010-11
 aapse pehle ke maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri ne bade paimaane par sudhaar kaa agenda taiyaar kiya tha, lekin sansad main ve ek bhi bill paas nahin kara paae
 What is your legislative and reform agenda? All i will say is that we had a consensus on the IIIT Bill and the Amendment Bill in Central Universities and Parliament is responding very positively to the issues that help us strengthen the institutions Huh
 vampanthi dalon, congress or bijepi ko ek hi manch par dekhnaa bahut durlabh baat he—or shiksha ke maamle main ham aisa karne main safal rahe hai
 National politics is not visible in education
 agle varsh ke liye aapkaa mukhya agenda kya he yaa shiksha ke kshetra ke liye mukhya jor kis cheez par he?shiksha koi agenda nahin hona chahie
 When it becomes an agenda, many problems are added
 mantri ke taur par meraa kaam ek manch uplabdh karana he taaki log ek-duusare se samvaad kar saken
 Tell us what is best for our students and our institutions
 hamane yahi kiya he
 There are allegations that the RSS is imposing its agenda on you
 aap iske netaaon or aresas kii ore jhukaav rakhane vaale logon ke saath kai baithken kar chuki hai
 When i meet (assam Chief Minister Tarun) Gogoi, (kerala Chief Minister Umman) Chandy, (west Bengal Chief Minister) Mamta Banerjee, nothing is said about it because it does not make spicy news
 main sabhi se milti hum, lekin main vahi kaam karti hum jo samvidhan kii maryaada main hota he
 i do not consider meeting with RSS people as an allegation
 mana jaataa he ki maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay kaa bahut-sa kaam aage nahin bad paa rahaa kyonki bahut-si filein ataki hui hai
 i understand that people who target me may not know about me
 mujhe post karnaa aasaan nahin he
 You can attack me, insult me, abuse me, threaten me on twitter
 
 
 lekin main vahi karuungi, jo jimmedaari mujhe di gai he—nirdhaarit prakriya ko apanaate hue kaam karnaa or kanoon ke daayre main rahete hue nitiyon ko lagu karwaanaa
 <it is very rare to see leftist parties, Congress and BJP on the same platform — and we have succeeded in doing so in the matter of education
 rajdhani dilli main guuruuvaar ko hawa bhi vaayu pradooshan ke maamle main khatarnaak rahi he
 According to the latest data of the Meteorological Department's agency that continuously measures Delhi's pollution, PM2 in most places here
 5 kaa pradooshan 449 microgram prati ghan meter rahaa he
 The safe limit of these fine particles is only 60 micrograms
 isi tarah piem 10 kanon kaa level 564 microgram prati ghan meter rahaa he
 The safe limit of these particles is 80 micrograms
 to kul milakar dilli kii hawa main khatarnaak kanon kaa pradooshan pichley saat dinon se lagaataar alarming level se kaaphi upar darj kiya ja rahaa he
 Therefore, due to fog conditions in the capital Delhi, smog is seen everywhere
 guuruuvaar subah dilli ke safadarajang main kohre kii vajah se visibility girakar 50 meter tak pahunch gai
 This condition is classified as dense fog
 din main koharaa to chanta lekin vaayu pradooshan par koi khaas asar nahin dikhaa
 In contrast, the amount of ozone on the surface increased rapidly in many places in the capital Delhi
 dopaher hote hote dilli vishvavidhyalay or mathura road par ozon gas kii maatra saamaanya ke mukaable badi hui record kii gai
 This condition can be called alarming
 vajah ye he ki vaise to ozon upree vayumandal main acchhee maani jaati he lekin jab ye jameen par badhati he to saans main isko andar lene par ye fefdon ko nuksaan pahunchaati he
 Ozone is a very volatile gas and it soon breaks down into a molecule of oxygen and an atom of oxygen
 oxigen kaa atom bahut jaldi pratikriya karke fefdon ko nuksaan pahunchaana shuru kar detaa he
 Because of this, old men and children are advised not to go out in the open in the event of surface ozone
 mausam vibhaag kaa kahana he ki shant hawa kii sthiti rajdhani dilli main 5 november tak bani rahegi or is vajah se yahaan par logon ko khatarnaak vaayu pradooshan kaa saamana 6 november tak karnaa padegaa
 According to the current forecast, PM2 in Delhi air on November 4 and 5
 5 kanon kii maatra 380 microgram ke aasapaas bani rahegi or piem 10 kanon kii maatra hawa main 503 microgram ke str par bani rahegi
 In this situation, people in the capital will be forced to breathe toxic air for 72 hours
 pidipi ke varisht netaa or saansad muzaffar beg ke mutabiq burhan vaani ko maarane se pehle rajya kii mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ko bharose main nahin liya gaya
 They also say that from the police and security forces themselves, it was claimed that they could arrest Burhan Wani in 15-20 minutes whenever he wanted
 beg sawaal uthaa rahe hai ki agar aisa tha to phir use maaraa kyon gaya

 Muzaffar Baig says that Burhan Wani was popular among the youth, not because he was a very big terrorist
 vah bas ‘sho bvaay’ (poster bvaay) tha
 He also played cricket and was very active on the Internet
 beg poochhate hai ki uske khilaaf karrwai kerani hi thi to phir apaat yojana kyon nahin banaayi gai
 On the question whether the PDP is suffering from the ground in Kashmir because of the situation that has arisen because people are angry with the government, Baig says that the country is suffering the loss, not the PDP
 party kaa utaar chadhaav chalata rahata he lekin philhal jo halaat paidaa hue hai usase duniya main desh kii chhavi ko dhakka laga he
 The Prime Minister is always trying to create that image
 beg is baat ko bhi galat maanate hai ki kashmir main samasya isliye paidaa hui kyonki ek duusare kii dhuravirohi pidipi or bijepi ne mil kar sarkaar banaayi
 They remind that the problem has been there for 25 years
 maujuuda vakt main halaat se thik dhang se nipta nahin gaya isliye ghati ko bure din dekhne pad rahe hai
 The comments beg kehete hai ki taaqat ke bal par maujuuda maahaul ko nahin badla ja saktaa
 Noting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement that more force should not be used, Baig says that such a statement of the Prime Minister is evidence that excessive force was used in Kashmir
 or bal prayog se samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin nikalegaa balki iske liye sahi tareeke se logon tak pahunch banane kii zarurat he
 Baig has demanded that a high-level inquiry should be conducted into the entire matter
 burhan vaani ko maare jane kii bhi or uske baad paidaa hue halaat kii bhi
 Those responsible for this should be brought to the fore
 jaanch supreme court ke ritred jaj se ho to behatar he
 Baig's second and important demand is that if the people of Kashmir want to win their hearts, the same policy that Atal Bihari Vajpayee talked about while resolving the issue while being in the realm of humanity as prime minister
 haalanki beg shanti sthapana main pakistan kii bhoomika ko lekar aashwast nahin hai, vah iske liye taiyaar hoga ki nahin, hoga to kab hoga
 But he clearly believes that internally, this entire matter should not be viewed as a political advantage or disadvantage

 The party keeps its ups and downs but the situation that has arisen at the moment has shocked the image of the country in the world
 us chhavi ko jise banane main pradhanmantri hameshaa koshish main lage rahete hai
 Baig also believes that the problem arose in Kashmir because the anti-pdp and BJP together formed the government
 ve yaad dilaate hai ki samasya 25 saalon se rahi he
 At present, the situation is not handled properly, so the valley is facing bad days
 tippaniyan Baig says that the current environment cannot be changed on the strength of strength
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke is bayaan kaa ki zyaada bal prayog nahin hona chahie, zikr kar beg kehete hai ki pradhanmantri kaa aisa kahana is baat kaa saboot he ki kashmir main zarurat se zyaada bal prayog kiya gaya

 And the use of force will not solve the problem, rather it needs to reach people in the right way
 beg kii maang he ki puure maamle kii ucchstareey jaanch karaayi jaae
 Burhan Wani to be killed and the situation that followed
 jo iske liye zimmedaar hai unako saamne laayaa janaa chahie
 If the investigation is better than a retired Supreme Court judge
 beg kii duusari or ahm maang he ki kashmir ke logon kaa dil jeetna he to jis tarah se pradhanmantri rahete atal bihari vaajapeyi ne insaaniyat ke daayre main rahete hue masale ke hal kii baat kii thi usee niti ko apanaaya jaae
 Although Baig is not convinced about Pakistan's role in peacekeeping, he will be ready for it or not, when it will happen
 lekin unka saafe maananaa he ki andruni taur par is puure maamle ko raajnneetik phaayde yaa nuksaan ke taur par nahin dekhnaa chahie
 Baig has demanded that a high-level inquiry should be conducted into the entire matter
 burhan vaani ko maare jane kii bhi or uske baad paidaa hue halaat kii bhi
 Those responsible for this should be brought to the fore
 jaanch supreme court ke ritred jaj se ho to behatar he
 Baig's second and important demand is that if the people of Kashmir want to win their hearts, the same policy that Atal Bihari Vajpayee talked about while resolving the issue while being in the realm of humanity as prime minister
 haalanki beg shanti sthapana main pakistan kii bhoomika ko lekar aashwast nahin hai, vah iske liye taiyaar hoga ki nahin, hoga to kab hoga
 But he clearly believes that internally, this entire matter should not be viewed as a political advantage or disadvantage

 (translation of English Speech) We have served this country by strengthening the foundation of democracy

 We knew that our own governments would come under surveillance
 phir bhi kya
 We started the Aadhaar card, so that you can reach the money directly
 ye choti baat nahin he

 There is not a single step which Congress has not taken for the betterment of the country
 chahen angrejon se ladanaa ho, chaahe bainkon kaa rashtriyakaran ho
 Whether it is the telecom revolution
 ye sab hamane kiya
 Now our goal is to make this democracy available to as many people as possible

 Everybody is young at heart

 We have to create a solution

 har tyohaar manaane ke peeche koi vajah hoti he
 Let's know the importance of the holy month of Ramadan
 kyon manaate hai ramajaan?islam main ramajaanke maheene ko sabase paak maheenaa mana jaataa he
 The Quran was revealed in the month of Ramadan
 mana jaataa he ki ramajaan ke maheene main jananath ke daravaaje khul jate hai
 Allah prays for the person of prayer and the person who worships, and in this holy month, he gets blessings from sins
 musalamaanon ke liermjanmaheene kii ahmiyat isliye bhi zyada he kyonki inhen dinon paigambar hazrat mohammad sahab ke jariye allaah kii ahm kitaab ‘quran sharif’ (najil) jameen par utari thi
 Therefore, Muslims spend most of the time in ibadat-tilawat (recitation of Namaz and reading Quran)
 musalmaan ramajaanke maheene main garibon or jaruratmand logon ko daan dete hai
 How to keep Rosa? It is called Sehri after getting up in the morning to eat daily
 sehari ke baad se suraj dhalane tak bhukhe-pyaase rahete hai
 Eating or drinking something breaks before the sun sets
 roje ke dauraan khaane-pine ke saath gussa karne or kisi kaa bura chaahane kii bhi manaahi he

 The prayer that is asked from the true heart during Iftar is humbling
 roje se chhot kise ?bacchon, bujurgon, musafiron, garbhvatee mahilaon or beemaari kii haalat main roje se chhot he

 After a bitter defeat in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi is now looking far away for BSP supremo Mayawati
 2014 ke lok sabha chunaav main shunya par simati bispi kaa pradarshan vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi niraashaajan hi rahaa
 The problem is that even finding Mayawati's Rajya Sabha member is difficult
 mayawati ke alaava samaajawaadee party netaa akhilesh yadav ke saamne main raajnneetik sankat ke badal chhaae hue hai
 To save politics, Akhilesh has the option of becoming a Rajya Sabha member before him
 haalanki unhen iske liye 2018 tak kaa intjaar karnaa hoga, abhi akhilesh yadav vidhaan parishad ke sadsy hai
 The challenge before the big leaders of the two big parties of UP is to save their political future
 agar mayawati kii party bispi, apni dhur virdohi sapa ke saath gathbandhan kar leti he to mayawati ke rajyasabha sadsy banane kaa rasta saaf ho jayega, lekin aisa hoga yaa nahin ye dekhnaa kaaphi dilachasp hoga
 If the SP and BSP form an alliance, both can send one member each to the Rajya Sabha
 akhilesh ke saamne rajya sabha main sadsy banane ke alaava vipaksh kaa netaa banane kii bhi chunauti he
 Azam Khan and Shivpal Yadav have also won this time, then maybe one of these can be made the Leader of the Opposition in the UP Assembly
 aapako bataa den ki 2012 main sapa se vidhansabha chunaav haarane ke baad mayawati rajyasabha sadsy ban gai thim kyonki us vakt bispi ke khate main 87 vidhayak the, lekin is baar unke paale main keval 19 siten hi ai hai jiske kaaran unkarajya sabha sadsy bananaa mushkilhakhyonki electrol college provijan ke hisaab se rajyasabha sadsy banane ke liye basapa ke paas paryaapt vidhayak nahin hai

 oro kii bhoomika mushkil thi?thodaa sangharsh karnaa padaa kyonki main 70 saal kaa hone vaala hum, aise main 13 varshiya ladke kii bhoomika nibhaana mushkil ho jaataa he
 When Balki told me about this, i laughed first, but i told him that brother, what were you drinking at night, tell me this
 unhone kaha ki aisi ek beemaari hoti he jiskaa naam he progeria
 Then i asked him how would you make me 13 years old, then he talked to the make-up then understood me
 aap badi screen par bade kalakaar, mahaan kalakaar ban gaye
 You made the big screen very big
 ab chote screen par aakar use bhi bada kar diya
 Do you like the small screen more? You are saying all these names to journalists
 mere khyal se chote parade kaa kaam zyada kathin he, film ke mukaable
 i respect all those who are related to small screen
 yahaan hamaare liye koi patakatha, dialog nahin likhaa hota
 Here everything has to be done with the mind
 kitne utaar -chadhaav laane padate hai, in sari baton kaa dhyaan rakhte hue use swayan nibhaana padataa he
 Shows on TV do it because there is more money in it, you are more in love with it or do you want to experiment with life? See all three things will come to mind if you are in any business
 ham kaam karenge, to kuch nayaa kar rahe hai, madhyam nayaa he or dhanrashi kaa alag maapdand he, uske anusaar chalenge
 Apart from money, i see a new medium as an artist
 yah us 
 It was at a time when no one had noticed that one can work in television
 mere liye yah ek pehla avasar tha
 Kaun Banega Crorepati is a show of greed? First thing is that we give check only when the person sitting in front shows his ability
 duusari baat yah ki jo insaan yahaan aakar kursi par baithta he vah hamaare desh ke chote-chote shaharon, gaanv se aashaaen lekar aata he
 His hopes will be fulfilled here in an hour, he never thought in life
 kebisi aisa madhyam he jahaan unhen aisa avasar miltaa he
 Bring in celebrity to enhance the show
 ab aapke saamne ham celibrity hi baithe hue hai naa, aap bhi le aate hai, ham bhi le aate hai, kya he usamen
 The arrival of the celebrity increases the mood, the public wants to meet them
 unhen unase milane kaa mauka milegaa to isamen kya galat he?jitne celibrity aate hai, 50 lakh yaa 1 karod lekar jate hai? unke ikyuu ke bare main bahut sawaal uthte hai
 Never lose a celebrity? No, there are many celebrity losers too
 jitne bhi celibrity program hote hai ve charity ke liye hote hai, isliye ham chaahate hai ki zyada se zyada charity main jaae
 We try to get the IQ of the celebrity that comes so that he wins more than most
 koun-sa kariyar zyada pasand he-chote parade kaa yaa bade parade kaa?mujhe kaam chahie
 If that work is related to art, then i am ready to do it
 aapke khaas mitra shahrukh khan se hamane puch liya ki aap chote parade par kaam kyon karnaa chaahate hai, kya aap amit ji kii nakal karte hai? to unhone kaha ki main nakal nahin karata lekin main logon ke bedroom main ghusna chahta hum? kya aapkaa bhi sochane kaa tarika yah he ki main bhi logon ke ghar main baitha hum raat nau baje
 i take the opportunity that i get
 kisi ke bedroom main janaa he yaa theatre main janaa he, yah soch kar main kaam nahin karata
 Big stars are coming on the small screen, so the rest of the TV stars are very upset
 ve kehete hai ki in logon ne hamaari naukari khatre main daal di he, hamen ab role nahin mil rahe
 i do the work that i get as a challenge, not because there is loss in one's job
 jitne bhi sah-kalakaaron ne tivi par kaam kiya he, chaahe vah shahrukh hon, salmaan hon, akshay hon yaa priyanka hon, un sabhi kii dharna yahi rahi hogi
 Were there any special effects, camera trick or something else in Pa? We did not make any special effects
 hamane tay kiya tha ki ise prakritik rakhenge, koi trick nahin karenge

 Do you think which phase was the most difficult, which was the most fluctuating? When the films started, it seemed that they would not work or not
 lekin us vakt hamaare paas khone ko kuch tha hi nahin
 Somebody had read one thing to me, which the British had said about Gandhiji, to avoid this man, this is a very dangerous man because he has nothing to lose
 kitni acchhee baat he
 That 
 jamaane main mere paas kuch khone ko nahin tha
 i was also ready to drive a taxi
 vah daur tha jisamen ksht hua
 But the time when i was accused of Bofors and i became an MP, that phase was very difficult
 darasal, raajnneeti ko jane bagaiyr ham bhaawanaaon main bah kar usamen chale gaye
 a month later it was found out that emotions do not work in this
 maine haar maan lee or raajnneeti chhod di
 Then when ABCL went bankrupt and all the films failed, it got attached, there was not even a single rupee in the pocket at that time, there were 50-60 cases, the house was auctioning us, we did not know how it would turn out
 from all
 lekin mehnat karke kisi tarah se ubar gaye
 These two rounds were very difficult
 is dauraan kai log aapke kareeb aae
 Rajiv Gandhi was your friend, Amar Singh was your friend, you have friendship with the Bal Thackeray family, who do you think are the closest? All are close
 amar singh ko hamane apane parivaar kaa sadsy mana he or aaj bhi maanate hai
 The same relationship is with the Gandhi family and the same is with Bala Saheb
 bala sahab kii bhale hi raajnneeti kuch bhi ho, lekin hameshaa unhone hamen or jaya ko apane parivaar kaa sadsy mana he
 When we got married to Jaya, he made Jaya enter her house as if her daughter-in-law was coming to her house
 is tarah kii bhavanaaen jab koi vyakti hamen dikhayega to hamaara uske saath bhaavnaatmak sambandh banataa he
 We do not interfere in his politics nor does he ask us to do something like this
 gandhi parivaar ke bare main aapane ek baar hamase kaha tha ki unhone daravaaje hamaare liye band kar die
 It seems that now the doors are open for you and their hearts too
 mere dil main koi bhi darwaja band nahin he
 i only want to say that i will respect the relationship that Babuji and Manji have built with the Gandhi family, from the time of Jawaharlal Nehru, from the time of Motilalji, from the time of Sarojini Naidu
 aapke parivaar kii teen mahilaayein- jaya ji, shweta or aishwarya ji-inamen se aap par kiski zyada chalati he
 White
 jo wo kahegi main vah kar duungaa kyonki wo hamaari beti he bas
 He also listens to sons, sons are our friends
 jis din unhone hamaara juuta pahananaa shuru kar diya, wo hamaare mitra ban gaye
 You have relations with industrialists too
 anil ambani, kumaar mangalam, sahaara shri
 With whom do you feel more comfortable
 sabhi ke saath
 Even before the grandfather of Kumar Mangalam
 jamaane se babuji kaa rishta rahaa he, ghanashyamdaas birla se lekar vasant kumaar ji tak, jo kumaar mangalam ji ke dadaji hai, aditya birla se rishta bahut purana rahaa he
 How can we forget that relationship? jab aap hamaari mitrataa bataaenge kumaar mangalam ji se to ham us rishte ko dhyaan dete hai, uskaa aadar karte hai, jisaki shuruyaat manji or babuji ne kii thi
 If you say the same thing, then Anil Ambani and Sahara Shree are not there because we have no family relationship with them
 ye najdiki sambandh tab hua jab ham film industry main aae
 In our era, our friendship is with Anil and with Sahara Shree
 peedi-dar-peedi jo chali aa rahi he baat, use aage badhaane main aap vishwaas rakhte hai or aapke daur main aapane jo dosti banaai he use bhi aage badhaane main vishwaas rakhte hai
 You had a very good friendship with Rajiv Gandhi, you feel that such a friendship should also grow in Rahul Abhishek
 main to maanata hum ki he or honi bhi chahie
 If we make a connection in this generation, then i hope that the coming generation, that is, Abhishek, or their children or their children too, will keep this relationship
 agar wo samajhate hai, jaise main maanata hum ki manji-babuji ne jo chijen prarambh kii use banaae rakhana meraa ferj banataa he or ek niyam banataa he parivaar main ki ham us kaayade-kanoon, un rishton ko kaayam rakhen
 Which actress would you like to do with a romantic role again? Whichever actress fits right in that role, there is no objection to working with her
 aapako nahin lagata ki aapako koi aisi bhoomika kerani chahie jisase desh ko disha pradaan kii ja sake?main aisa maanata hum ki mujhamen khud main itani kshamta nahin ki main aisa soch sakuun isliye hameshaa aisi aashaa main rahata hum ki koi aisa kirdaar soche or phir main use nibhaauun
 But as you said if i want to do something for the country, i do not discuss it but i keep doing a lot in the form of charity etc

 The BMC is looking to create a shopping plaza, a subway and parking space for 600 vehicles, but shopkeepers on the Bandra-linking road are protesting
 unka kahana he ki itani badi yojana se pehle unke bare main nahin sochaa gaya
 Currently, the BMC is talking of removing them from here and settling near the road, but the shopkeepers say that they will be removed completely, due to which they will lose their means of livelihood
 tippaniyan Shopkeepers are unhappy with shoppers here
 unka maananaa he ki isse mumbai kii pahchaan maane jane vaali is sadak kaa or is bazaar kaa nakshaa badal jayega
 Also known for its cheap prices, this market will become expensive

 Mumbai's Bandra-linking street, adorned with clothes, shoes and other things of fashion, and the decorating market here are among the city's main markets, but now preparations are underway to change the map
 biemasi yahaan ek shopping plaza, ek subway or 600 gadiyon ke liye parking spes bananaa chaah rahi he, lekin bandra-linking road par based dukandaar virodh kar rahe hai
 He says that he never thought of such a big plan
 filhal biemasi unhen yahaan se hataakar sadak ke paas basaane kii baat kar rahi he, lekin dukandaaron kaa kahana he ki unhen puri tarah se hataa diya jayega, jiske chalate unase unki jeevika kaa saadhan chhin jayega
 The comments dukandaaron ke saath yahaan khariddaari karne vaale log bhi naakhush hai
 They believe that this will change the map of this road, which is considered to be the identity of Mumbai, and this market
 saath hi apane saste daamon ke liye janaa jane vaala yah bazaar mahangaa ho jayega
 This design of the bandra-linking Road metamorphosis has been approved by the BMC chief
 magar asli chunauti is dizine ko amal main laane kii he
 Though the scheme is yet to be approved by many departments, whether the shopkeepers on the linking road or the people shopping here - no one seems happy with the scheme

 Apart from this, the industry sector was moaning due to lack of capacity, lack of capital and slow demand, while the agriculture sector was in crisis due to fall in yield prices, poor infrastructure and drought
 phir bhi sarkaar ne sakal gharelu utpaada main oochaal ke daawey kiye jo hajam nahin hote

 paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav main madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or mizoram main matdaan ke baad ab piem modi or bijepi adhyaksh ne apana puraa focus rajasthan or telugana chunaav main jeet kaise mili is baat par laga diya he
 Rajasthan and Telangana elections are slowly reaching their peak
 piem modi or amit shah acchhee tarah se jaanate hai ki telugana main unki party sarkaar banane main sakasham nahin he, lekin trikoniya chunaav main agar aisi sthiti bani ki agar kisi party ko bahumat nahin miltaa hai to bijepi chandrashekhar raav kii tiares ko samarthan dekar 2019 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle endie kunba badha sakati he
 If the BJP is getting a tough competition from the Congress in the five state assembly elections, then it is Rajasthan, BJP leaders are accepting this thing from the open platform
 rajasthan kii 33 gilen hai, jinamein 200 vidhansabhaayen hai
 But once again, the focus of Amit Shah's electoral strategy to bring BJP to the top of power in Rajasthan is on 120 assembly seats in 22 districts
 piem modi ne ab tak rajasthan main sirf 10 chunavi reliyaan kii hai
 These rallies have been held in Alwar, Bhilwara, Beneshwar Dham, Kota, Nagaur and Bharatpur
 apane videsh daure se aane ke baad ve jodhpur, hanumangarh, sikar or jaipur main bhi raily karenge
 In view of the electoral atmosphere in the last days, his two-three rally can be increased
 amit shah kii chunavi ranneeti ke tahat piem modi bhale hi 10 chunavi raily kar rahe hai, lekin in reliyon se bade ‘modi effect’ kii ummid he
 Amit Shah also 12 districts Phalodi, Barmer, Jalore, Sirohi, Dungarpur, deeg-kumher, Karauli, S
P
 madhopur, khajuwala, navalgadh, sujangadh or risinghnagar main chunavi raily kar rahe hai
 If sources are to be believed, these 22 districts are in the focus of Amit Shah's election strategy because the poor welfare schemes of the central government in these districts have seen a lot of impact on the land
 isliye bijepi ko 22 jilon kii 120 siton main lagbhag 80 siten jeetne kii ummid he
 It is clear that PM Modi and Amit Shah will play an important role in the Modi government's poor welfare schemes in electoral mathematics
 piem modi auchhamit shahchunaav hone se kareeb ek saal pehle hi apni ranneetiyon ko anjaam dena shuru kar dete hai, jiskaa phayda unhen chunaav main bharpoor miltaa he

 To a large extent, this applies to the BJP in the case of Union Minister Giriraj Singh
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi par bihar ke hajipur main die gaye bayaan par hue bavaal par bhale giriraaj singh ne khed jaataa diya ho, bhale party adhyaksh amit shah ne bhavishya main unase aise vivadaspad bayaan dene se parhez karne kii naseehat kii aupchaarikta bhi puri kar lee ho or media main is khabar ko li bhi kar diya gaya ho
 But why Giriraj makes such a statement and what compulsions the party or government head Narendra Modi could not take action against him is a different story
 darasal giriraaj singh ke rajantik biodata main bahut kuch nahin he, lekin unke rajantik safar kii sabase badi uplabdhi kahie yaa puunji ki wo kuch logon ke dukh yaa bijepi main sankraman kaal ke mitra rahe hai
 But not secretly but on the injury of the sting and in the people whose happiness they lived with, two names are prominent, one is Narendra Modi and the other is Amit Shah
 modi ke khilaaf jin dinon unki party ke sheersh netritv kii sahmati se bihar main nitish kumaar kii aguwai vaali janata dal united or bijepi ke netaa duuri bana kar rakhte the yaa kahiye rajnatik rangabhed karte the, us samay gaahe bagaahe or 2010 se niyamit rup se giriraaj singh ne nijee taur par narendra modi phens club chalaaya hua tha, jiskaa kaam hota tha har maukey par modi ke samarthan main bayaan dena
 Put up a gate with Modi's poster in Nitish Kumar's gathering or in the city where you are visiting and you can say that Giriraj was the original singer or cheer leader who performed 'modi Naam Kevalam'
 jahaan tak amit shah kaa sawaal he, ye sab jaanate hai ki kai varshon tak nyaayalay ke aadesh ke kaaran gujarat jane par bandish ke kaaran wo desh ke har rajya main ghoomte the or jab bhi wo bihar gaye, giriraaj ne unki mehmaan navaji main koi kasar nahin chodi
 You can say that the astrologers of Giriraj probably predicted them accurately about the future of these two leaders, which Giriraj left no stone unturned to implement
 or jab giriraaj singh pichley saal party ke tikat par navada loksabhaa kshetra se ummidavaar the or jab modi unke liye prachaar karne gaye, tab unhone logon se apil kii ki chunaav giriraaj nahin balki wo lard rahe hai, isliye vot dene ke baad navada ke vikaas main wo koi kasar nahin chodenge
 And perhaps this is the reason why Giriraj not only finds a place in the Union Cabinet even after several cases and pending income tax cases, but he is given the responsibility of a ministry in which the Prime Minister is interested
 giriraaj na sirf mantri hue balki apane sajaateey ek aise police adhikari ko apana privet secretary banaaya jisaki kendriya pratiniyukti kaa maamla kuch kaarnon se maheenon se atka tha
 Whereas before this, it was clear from the attitude of Prime Minister Modi that no Union Minister can keep his own people, especially those against whom a case is going on, in his staff
 lekin maamla giriraaj kaa ho tab modi bhi jhuke
 It was clear that not only was all the blood pardoned for Giriraj, but whether he gave a statement or kept money, for him, Modi could not hear or hear anything unpleasant like Gandhiji's monkey
 lekin ab sawaal he ki unke khilaaf koi karrwai kyon nahin ho sakati? iskaa ek or ek hi kaaran he ki wo jis bhoomihaar jati se aate hai us jati ke logon main koi karrwai karne par bahut zyada nakaaratmak pratikriya ho sakati he
 Perhaps Modi is not ready to bear the wrath of this caste in the election year
 modi ko atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa wo anubhav yaad hoga jab unhone dow
 CP Thakur was removed from the cabinet in a case of corruption, then Bihar BJP leaders reached out to him after protests across the state and urged him to make him a minister again because whether there is any benefit in making the removal of that caste
 People are being hurt politically a lot due to anger
 ant main giriraaj singh kaa kahana he ki unhone sari baaten of da record kahi thi or media ne isse record kar or dikhaa kar bahut galat kiya he
 But when someone asked him that your party is so soft on the sting in the AAP case in Delhi, why be soft with you? tab giriraaj ne bhi manaa ki jaisaa aap boenge vaise kaatenge
 The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that a woman employee of the Central Government can take two years' leave without any disturbance to the care of her child
 nyaayamurti es je mukhopadhyaay or nyaayamurti ve gopal gauda ne kalakatta ucch nyaayalay kaa aadesh nirast karte hue yah vyavastha di
 The High Court had said that the rules of the Central Civil Service (leave) do not allow 730 days of leave for the care of children without any interference
 nyaayadhishon ne kaha, paripatron or niyam 43-si ke avlokan se pataa chalata he ki 18 saal se kam aayu ke naaballig bachche kii maa sarkari mahila karmchaaree adhiktam 730 din kaa bagaiyr kisi vyavdhaan ke avkaash le sakati he
 Child care is not just for raising a small child but also for their needs like examination and disease
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki bacchon ke dekhbhaal ke liye 730 din se adhik kaa avkaash anya chhuttiyon ko milakar bhi diya ja saktaa he yadi chhuttiyaan uplabdh hai
 The court also said that the High Court's conclusion is neither based on Rule 43-C nor on the Central Government guidelines
 nyaayalay ne sarkari mahila karmchaaree kaakali ghosh kii yachika par yah vyavastha sunai jisane use apane bete kii pariksha kii taiyaari ke laye 730 din kaa avkaash dene se inkaar kane ke sarkaar ke nirnay ko chunauti di thi
 This female employee had earlier approached the Central Administrative Tribunal in Kolkata

 justise esaaar sen ne kaha ki vah saaf kar dena chaahate hai ki kisi ko bhi bharat ko doosraa islamic desh banane kii koshish nahin kerani chahie
 At the same time, Union Minister Giriraj Singh supported the statement of the Justice and said that he fully agreed with his statement
 justise esaaar sen ne kaha ki agar aisa hota he to bharat or duniya ke liye yah sabase kharaab din hoga
 He is confident that PM Modi's government will understand this
 jab tak kisi ko rajya main rahane kaa man he tab tak use piarsi ke liye aavedan karne kaa haq he
 Actually, Justice SR Sen gave this order on the petition of Amon Rana
 bataa den ki amon ko mul nivasee pramaan patr dene se inkaar kar diya gaya tha
 He said that as long as someone wants to stay in the state, he has the right to apply for PRC
 hindu, sikh, jain, buddha, isai, parsi, khaasi, gaaro evam jaintiya jo bharat aa chuke hai or jinako pakistan, afghanistan, bangladesh se bharat main aana he
 Also, the Central Government should take necessary steps to bring laws for the benefit of people of Indian origin who are living outside
 adaalat ko ummid he ki sarkaar aitihaasik pariprekshya main is aadesh kaa dhyaan rakhte hue or is desh or yahaan ke logon kii raksha karegi
 'NRC process disturbances' Meghalaya High Court Justice SR Sen said that in my view NRC process is wrong as most of the foreigners became Indians and the original Indians stayed out of it
 unhone kaha ki jab desh kaa vibhaajan hua to netaaon ne bhavi pidiyon or desh ke hit ke bare main soche bina seemaa rekhaaen tay kar deen
 This has created problems today
 main baraak ghati or assam ghati ke hinduon se apil karata hum ki ve saath aaen or milakar hal par pahunche kyonki hamaari samskruti, parampara or dharm samaan hai
 We should not hate each other only on the basis of language
 pakistan ne apane aapako islamic desh ghoshit kiya tha or tab bharat jo dharm ke aadhaar par vibhajit hua tha usko bhi hindu raashtra ghoshit kiya janaa chahie tha, lekin vah secular desh rah gaya
 He said that this court hopes that the Indian government will take a conscious decision on Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddha Parsis and Christians who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan
 hindu-sikh logon ko sabase zyada takalimpane aadesh main unhone kaha ki hindu, sikh, jain, buddha, isai, parsi dharm ke logon kaa pakistan, bangladesh, afghanistan ke logon kaa aaj bhi utpeedan hota he or inke paas jane ke liye koi jagah nahin hoti he
 He also said that the Hindus who entered India during Partition are also considered foreigners
 jo meri najar main avaidh he or prakritik nyaay ke siddhant ke khilaaf he
 He said that India has attained independence with great difficulty
 iskaa dard sabase zyada hindu or sikh dharm ke logon ko jhelana padaa
 He had to leave his ancestral property, the birthplace
 ham isko nahin bhul sakate
 Although i cannot fault here for mentioning that when the Sikhs came, they got rehabilitation, but this did not happen to the Hindus
 unhone kaha ki hamen pehle yah maananaa hoga ki pehle ham bhartiya hai or phir ek insaan or uske baad vah samudaay aata he jiske ham hote hai
 i hope the government will take a decision for such disadvantaged people
 unhone piem narendra modi, kanoon mantri or sansad se maang kii he vah ek aisa kanoon laae jisase pakistan, bangladesh, afghanistan se aae hindu, sikh, jain, buddha, parsi or isai dharm ke logon ko bina kisi poochtacha or kagajaat ke bharat kii naagarikta mili
 Giriraj supported Justice Sen
 Union Minister Giriraj Singh also supported Justice Sen's statement on Hindu Rashtra, saying, 'I completely agree with him
 main to sadhuwaad detaa hum, dhanyavad detaa hum
 a person sitting on a constitutional post has made such a comment which is felt by most citizens of the country
 'unhone aage kaha ki aaj 13 disambar he, is din sansad par hamalaa hua tha
 There are many things that are all related to each other
 1947 main jinna ne desh kaa bantwaaraa karaayaa
 On the basis of religion, its good results are not visible in India today
 is samay unhone jo tippanee kii he, agar us samay kii jaati to aaj bharat kii yah sthiti nahin hoti
 i personally welcome his comments
 ise sarkaar se naa jod kar naa dekhen, giriraaj singh se jodakar dekhen
 The Pakistan Supreme Court today directed the government to ensure that former military ruler Pervez Musharraf was not able to leave the country as hearing has started on several petitions seeking a case of treason against him
 musharraf ke khilaaf samvidhan kii bhaavana ko aahat karne or 2007 main apatkaal lagane kii maang karne vaali yachikaaon par supreme court main aaj sunwaayee shuru ho gayi he
 a two-member bench headed by Judge Javad s Khwaja ordered the Home Secretary to take steps to prevent Musharraf from going abroad
 supreme court se rashtradroh (dand) adhinium 1973 ke tahat musharraf par mukadmaa chalaane kaa sarkaar ko nirdesh die jane kii apil karne vaali paanch yachikaaon par shuruuaati sunwaayee ke baad peeth ne yah nirdesh jari kiye
 The bench also issued notices to the government, Musharraf and other defendants and adjourned the hearing till Tuesday
 yachikaaon main kaha gaya he ki purv sainya shaasha ne 2007 main apatkaal ghoshit kar samvidhan kaa ulanghan kiya he or unke khilaaf rashtradroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya janaa chahie
 The petitioners have said that the Upper House of Parliament passed a resolution in January 2012 that Musharraf should be arrested on his return home but the government did not accept it
 yachikaayen daakhil karne vaale vakeelon ne yah tark bhi diya ki sarkaar supreme court dwaara purv main die gaye us aadesh par bhi karrwai karne main vifal rahi he jisamen prashasan ko samvidhan kaa ulanghan karne ke liye musharraf ke khilaaf karrwai karne kaa nirdesh diya gaya tha
 After the hearing, the petitioners' lawyers said that the 'VIP protocol' should not be given to Musharraf as he is an accused in many cases
 unhone kaha ki supreme court main purv raashtrapati ke khilaaf maamle se yah sunishchit hoga ki koi bhavishya main samvidhan kii bhaavana ko aahat nahin karegaa
 He said that the generals and others supporting Musharraf should also be made accountable
 somvaar subah yachikaaon par sunwaayee shuru hone se kai ghante pehle mukhya nyaayadhish iftikhar choudhary ne musharraf ke khilaaf ‘rashtradroh (dand) adhinium 1973’ ke tahat mukadmaa chalaane kii maang karne vaali yachikaaon par sunwaayee karne ke liye pichley saptaah gathit teen sadasyeey nyaayadhish peeth se khud ko alag kar liya
 He took this step when Chaudhary was questioned about Musharraf's involvement in the dozens of judges removed during the 2007 Emergency

 Another petition has been filed by Iqbal Haider
 in yachikaaon main musharraf ko namjad kiya gaya he or sarkaar ko prativaadee banaaya gaya he
 The petitioners have also asked the Supreme Court to direct the government to take Musharraf into custody
 yachikakartaon kaa kahana he ki musharraf ne 2007 ke apatkaal ke dauraan jajon ko hiraasat main lekar nyaay tak pahunch ko baadhit kiya or unke sthaan par asanvaidhanik rup se duusare jajon ko niyukt kiya

 But the question is not of the stomach, but of the vote, so there is a preparation to cover the sin from the back door

 Sonia's soldiers have prepared a formula - feeding and drinking is not a new tradition in India
 congress ko bhi isaki keemat pataa he
 So she wants to try this weapon in the shape of an ordinance

 The Congress is assuming that after four months before the election, it will not be able to refuse if it asks for the allowance of votes by feeding it to the Indian people

 vah aise-aise kartab karte hai ki bandar bhi peeche chhot jaaen
 He is a devotee of Hanuman ji and has a great attachment to monkeys
 log bataate hai ki unke ashram main bandaron kii badi sankhya hai, jinke saath vah vakt bitaate hai
 Similarly, Mahagiri Ji Maharaj Baba is from Kushinagar
 unke haath main ek bada sa danda rahata he
 He claims that all the sufferings of the body are removed with the touch of a stick
 mahagiri ji maharaj ne bataaya varsho tak sadhana main leen rahane ke baad hi unhone yah prasiddhi hasil kii
 The crowd around him also agrees with him
 tabhi to unki kutiyaa ke baahar apana dukh-dard mitaane waalon kii lambi line lagi hui he
 Apart from these two Babas, there is another Baba, Falhari Baba, who has come to this religious fair to wish for world welfare
 inke bhakton kaa daawa he ki baba 40 varsho se soe nahin hai
 These Baba are associated with Shri Panchayati Akhara
 bhakt bataate hai ki baba aath se 10 ghante tak pani main khadey rahakar sadhana karte hai
 According to Baba, he only closes his eyes for half an hour in 24 hours
 falahari baba ke naam se mashhoor is sant ne pichley chaar dashakon se namak, meetha or ann kaa tyaag kar rakhaa he

 a Delhi court reserved its order for February 21 on the cbi's plea seeking to end the case against Italian businessman Quattrocchi in the Bofors scam case
 mukhya metropolitan magistrate vinod yadav ne kaha, ‘is adaalat ne daleelein sun lee hai
 There is no reason to hold this decision for the Central Information Commission
 is maamle main 21 farvari ko faisla sunaaya jayega
 The judge reserved his decision after the plea of advocate Ajay Agarwal was over
 agarwal kwatrochi ke khilaaf maamla samaapt kiye jane kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 However, Aggarwal gave an application in the court during the hearing that he should wait for the cic's decision in the case, which is likely to come within this month
 adaalat ne agarwal kii arji ko sweekaar nahin karte hue kaha, agarwal kii daleelein janhit main lambey samay tak suni gai he
 The court does not intend to give them any more time
 agarwal chaahate the ki adaalat tab tak pratiksha kare jab tak ki unhen siaisi ke aadesh ke jariye soochna nahin mil jaae
 He said it would prove crucial for the court in deciding the cbi's plea to close the case against Quattrocchi
 agarwal ne adaalat se kaha ki unhone sibiai ke soochna dene se inkaar karne ke baad unhone iske liye siaisi kaa darwaja khatkhataya he
 He said he hoped the CIC order would come by this month
 agarwal ne kaha ki unhone siaisi ke samaksh apil daayar kii thi or maamle par buudhvaar ko sunwaayee shuru kii gai
 Additional Solicitor General PP Malhotra, on behalf of the CBI, however opposed Agarwal's arguments, saying that the information he had sought from the CIC was not relevant in the case
 malhotra ne kaha, ‘adhivaktaa ajay agarwal is adaalat kaa samay barbaad kar rahe hai
 Refusing to give more time to Agarwal to pursue his arguments in the case, the court told him that he can give documents and other information to the court whenever he gets information from the CIC

 The comments bataa den ki rajya main saatven vetan ayog kii vartmaan siforeeshon ko lagu karne se sarkaar par pehle saal 26,573 karod rupee kaa atirikt boj bad saktaa he

 He had also indicated to give a salary gift as per the intention of the Seventh Pay Commission before the election
 isliye mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar chunaav main jane se pehle vetan ayog ko lagu karne kii ghoshnaa bhi kar de

 Stoinis, who scored 121 off 73 balls against the National Indigenous Squad for the Commonwealth Bank Bushrangers in Australia's domestic circuit, hit six sixes in an over from Brendan Smith and Smith's misfortune was that he had a total in this over
 37 runs scored, as his first ball was declared wide

 hamane naukari series kii shuruyaat isliye kii taaki iske saath-saath aap naujavaanon kii zindagi main jhaank saken, dekh saken ki unke saath sarkarein kaisaa mazaaq kar rahi hai
 At the time of elections, no youth who seems to be doing the youth seems ready to fix this exam system

 Everyone wants the youth to get the benefit of heartburn, all i want is that the youth get the job done with clean process and transparency
 'itani shakti hamen dena daata, man kaa vishwaas kamazor ho na', ankush film kaa yah gaanaa gaate hue ye 12,460 shikshak itnaa pradarshan kar chuke hai ki vaaki inhen shakti or dhiraj kii bahut zarurat he
 On 15 March, they resumed in Lucknow and started demanding their joining
 bhaajapa mukhyalay ke saamne ye jamaa ho gaye or naare lagane lage
 Their fight is bizarre
 do-do baar adaalat se cese jeet chuke hai
 But the government is not joining them
 hamane ye masalaa prime time kii naukari series ke ank 7 or 24 main uthaaya tha or ab 28wein ank main bhi uthaa rahe hai
 One question cannot be answered as to why these people have not started the process of joining when they have won the case from single bench and double bench
 kyon nahin ho rahi he
 When 12,460 teachers can have this condition, then understand what will be the condition of the remaining examinations
 pehali baar ye 3 november 2017 ko elahabaad hai court se jeet gaye
 The court said that these teachers should be admitted in two months
 3 janvari 2018 ko do maheene puure ho gaye magar 12,460 shikshak bahaali kaa intazaar karte rah gaye
 The case was then heard in the division bench
 vahaan se bhi ye 12,460 shikshak jeet gaye
 This time the High Court asked the UP government to start the recruitment process within 4 weeks
 6 march ko chaar hafte puure ho gaye
 On 15 March, they again came out on dharna demonstration
 2016 main 12,460 shikshakon kii bhartee kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha
 Its counseling continued till March 2017
 18 march 2017 tak saare zilon ke cat of gaye or merit list ban gai thi
 But on 23 March, the Yogi government banned these recruitments
 uske baad se ye noujvaan har maukey par pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Sometimes they sit, they fight in court
 yahaan tak ki 16 july 2017 se teen sitambar 2017 tak dhai maheene lakhanu ke lakshmana mela maidan main dharna bhi diya
 Many mlas and mps have also written letters to the government for these, yet they are not joining
 kendriya shram evam rojgaar mantri santosh kumaar gangavar ne bhi inke samarthan main patr likhaa he phir bhi inaki jwoining nahin ho rahi he
 Why is there a need to write a letter, even if there are two orders of the court, nothing is happening
 agar kuch ho rahaa he, to sarkaar ko in 12,460 naujavaanon ko bataa dena chahie ki uski taiyaari kis str par he or iraadaa kya he
 Is that why we are being postponed so that they don't have to pay a few more days or is there something else
 pashchim bengal se bhi hamen naukari siries ke liye lagaataar log likhte rahete hai or bengal ke sarvice kamishan kaa haal bataate rahete hai
 In the 13th episode of prime time, we had shown that the youth of Bengal are living unemployed destitute
 west bengal sarvice kamishan ko best bengal public sarvice kamishan main mila diya gaya tha
 Earlier there were separate commissions for recruitment of officers and staff, now there is only one
 malda jile main shikshakon kii bahaali ke liye chal rahe andolan ko 25 din se adhik ho chuke hai lekin unki koi sunwaayee nahin kar rahaa he or wo hamen lagaataar sandesh bhejte hai
 Similarly, on March 7, madrasa teachers held a demonstration in Kolkata
 isse pehle bhi kai baar andolan kar chuke hai
 Their problem is that they brought them to our NDTV office from Bengal
 sangharsh karte-karte bag main dastavezon kii file moti ho gai he
 These people are also fighting the case in the Supreme Court
 inhone bataaya ki west bengal madrasa sarvice kamishan 2008 main bana tha, iske tahat 614 sarkari madad praapt madrasa skool hai
 Seven lakh students study
 bengal ke kolkata madrasa kalege kii sthapana 1780 main hui thi
 Flocked out of it performing
 ye log bengal kii alag alag jagahon main kai baar pradarshan kar chuke hai
 They say that they have performed more than 600 performances in Bengal
 294 vidhayak or 42 saansad inke liye patr likh chuke hai
 Petition has been given to the Chief Minister
 ye sabhi puraani baaten hai jo unhone hi bataai hai
 The case is that between 2008 and 2013, there were 12,000 teachers reinstated in them, but the Madrasa Management Committee made the case that the Madrasa Commission did not have the right to reinstate teachers and this interfered with the autonomy of the minority institution
 management cameti chaahati thi ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 30 ke anusaar bahaali kaa adhikaar uske paas rahe
 Teachers say that management first used arbitrary restorations
 kamishan se bahaali hone par pratiyogita ke baad inaki merit list bani he
 The future of these teachers is at stake in the Madrasas Management Committee and the Madrasa Service Commission's legal battle
 kyonki 12 march 2014 ko hoicourt ne aadesh diya ki madrasa sarvice kamishan avaidh he
 Asked the commission not to make any kind of appointment
 kolkata hoicourt ke division bench ne bhi mana ki madrasa chayan ayog avaidh he or iske dwaara kii gai bahaaliyaan bhi avaidh hai
 Sword hangs on 12,000 teachers who were restored before this order
 ab supreme court ne do saal pehle hoicourt ke faisle par roak lagaate hue kaha ki riselt nikaal diya jaae
 The final decision did not come
 tab se is maamle ko kabhi hoicourt to kabhi supreme court chal rahaa he
 The next date in the Supreme Court is on 4 April
 hamen to pataa bhi nahin ki madrasa prabandhan samiti ke kya adhikaar hai yaa madrasa chayan ayog ko bhang kiye jane se kin logon kii zindagi prabhavit ho rahi he, log khud hi hamase sampark kar rahe hai jinhen ham thodi bahut jaanch ke baad aapke saamne rakh dete hai
 We thought that there would be a mistake in telling us, but so far no selection commission has said to what extent our point is wrong
 sab is intazaar main hai ki jaldi naukari series band ho jaae taaki phir sabakuch vaisaa hi chalata rahe
 After passing the Military Engineering Service exam, 476 youth are waiting for joining

 chaatro kaa kahana he ki general catagori kii jwining ho gai he magar anusuchit jati or obisi chaatro kii jwining nahin ho rahi he
 You are wondering why i am doing this count, so i am doing it so that you can know whether the student is in the number of 24 or in the number of 12,460, there is no difference on the selection commissions
 kai baar lagata he ki sarkaar hi bahaali nahin karnaa chaahati he, chunaav aate hai to bhartiyon nikaal di jaati hai or uske baad kabhi court to kabhi nakal ke naam par inhen atka diya jaataa he

 The comments bihar ke chhapra main ek jepi uniwarsity he, isamen jin logon ne 2012 main bie main admician liya he wo abhi tak bie hi kar rahe hai
 The students themselves say that more than 40,000 students are caught in the affair of Jaypee University

 This is the Langat Singh College of BR Ambedkar Bihar University
 yahaan ke 2016-19 batch ke ek chaatr ne bataaya ki abhi tak ek bhi varsh kii pariksha nahin hui he
 Ideally, the first year examination should have been held in August 2017 but due to various reasons, there was not a single examination in this university in the year of 2017
 visi kaa kahana he ki ve 11 maheene pehle aae hai or chizon ko durust karne main lage hai
 2017 was a zero year due to student union elections and strike
 is vishvavidhyalay main kareeb do lakh chaatr hai
 Even after this number, if students have this condition then it is very sad
 aisa lagata he ki in chaatro ke mata-pita or bihar ke samaaj ko isse koi fark nahin padataa he ki unke bachche barbaad kiye ja rahe hai
 Very Sad

 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Singing this song from the film Ankush, '124760 teachers have performed so much that they really need strength and endurance
 15 march ko ye lakhanu main phir jamaa hue or apni jwining kii maang karne lage
 They gathered in front of the BJP headquarters and started raising slogans
 inaki ladaai vicitra he
 Have won the case from court twice
 magar sarkaar inaki jwining nahin kara rahi he
 We had raised this issue in the prime time job series in points 7 and 24 and now we are raising it in the 28th issue as well
 ek sawaal kaa jawaab nahin mil rahaa ki jab ye log single bench or dabl bench se cese jeet chuke hai tab inaki jwining kii prakriya kyon nahin shuru ho rahi he
 Why is it not happening? jab 12,460 shikshakon kii ye haalat ho sakati he to samajhie baaki parikshaon kii kya sthiti hogi
 He won the Allahabad High Court for the first time on 3 November 2017
 court ne kaha ki do maheene main in shikshakon kii bhartee ho jaani chahie
 Two months were completed on 3 January 2018, but 12,460 teachers were waiting for reinstatement
 phir yah maamla division bench main suna gaya
 From there also these 12,460 teachers won
 is baar hoicourt ne upi sarkaar se kaha ki 4 hafte ke bheetar bhartee kii prakriya shuru kiijie
 Four weeks were completed on 6 March
 15 march ko ye phir dharne pradarshan par utar aae hai
 In 2016, advertisement for recruitment of 12,460 teachers was released
 march 2017 tak isaki counselling chalati rahi
 By March 18, 2017, all the districts were cut off and merit list was made
 lekin 23 march ko yogi sarkaar ne in bhartiyon par roak laga di
 Since then these youngsters have been performing on every occasion
 kabhi dharna dete hai, kabhi adaalat main mukadmaa ladate hai
 Even two and a half months from July 16, 2017 to September 3, 2017, staged a protest at the Lakshman Mela ground in Lucknow
 bahut se vidhayak or saansadon ne inke liye sarkaar ko patr bhi likhaa he phir bhi inaki jwoining nahin ho rahi he
 Union Labor and Employment Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar has also written a letter in support of them, yet they are not joining
 patr likhane kii zarurat hi kyon he, adaalat ke do-do aadesh hai tab bhi kuch nahin ho rahaa
 If anything is going on, the government should tell these 12,460 youngsters at what stage their preparation is and what is the intention
 kya isliye taala ja rahaa he taaki kuch din or inhen vetan na dena pade yaa koi or baat he
 People from West Bengal also continue to write to us for job series and keep telling the condition of the service commission of Bengal
 prime time ke 13wein episod main hamane dikhaaya tha ki bengal ke yuva berozegaar besahaara maare-maare phir rahe hai
 The West Bengal Service Commission was merged with the Best Bengal Public Service Commission
 pehle adhikariyon or karmchaariyon kii bhartee ke liye alag-alag ayog hote the, ab vahaan ek hi he
 The ongoing agitation for the reinstatement of teachers in Malda district has been over 25 days but no one is listening to them and they send us constant messages
 isi tarah 7 march ko madrasa ke shikshakon ne kolkata main ek pradarshan kiya
 Even before this, we have agitated many times
 inaki pareshaani kaa alam ye he ki wo inhen bengal se hamaare enditivi karyaalay le ai
 The file of documents in the bag has become thick while struggling
 ye log supreme court main bhi cese lard rahe hai
 He told that the West Bengal Madrasa Service Commission was formed in 2008, there are 614 government aided madrasa schools under it
 saat lakh chaatr padhate hai
 Kolkata Madrasa College in Bengal was established in 1780
 iske baahar hujum pradarshan kar rahaa he
 These people have performed several times in different places of Bengal
 inkaa kahana he ki ye bengal main 600 se adhik pradarshan kar chuke hai
 294 mlas and 42 mps have written letters for them
 mukhyamantri ko yachika di ja chuki he
 These are all old things that he has told
 maamla yah he ki 2008 se 2013 ke bich inamen 12,000 shikshakon kii bahaali hui thi lekin madrason kii prabandhan samiti ne hi cese kar diya ki madrasa kamishan ko shikshakon kii bahaali kaa adhikaar nahin he or yah alpsankhyak santhaan kii swaittata main dakhldanzi he
 The management committee wanted it to retain the right of reinstatement as per Article 30 of the Constitution
 shikshak kehete hai ki prabandhan pehle manamaane tareeke se behaal karata tha
 His merit list has been made after the competition on his reinstatement from the Commission
 madrason kii prabandhan samiti or madrasa sarvice kamishan kii kanoonee ladaai me in shikshakon kaa bhavishya daanv par he
 Because on 12 March 2014 the High Court ordered that the Madrasa Service Commission is illegal
 kamishan ko kaha ki wo kisi prakaar kii niyukti na kare
 The Division Bench of the Kolkata High Court also held that the Madrasa Selection Commission is illegal and the restorations made by it are also illegal
 is aadesh se pehle behaal ho chuke 12,000 shikshakon par talwaar latak gai he
 Now two years ago, the Supreme Court stayed the High Court ruling and said that the result should be removed
 antim faisla nahin aayaa
 Since then, the High Court is sometimes running the Supreme Court
 supreme court main agali taarikh 4 april ko padi he
 We do not even know what are the rights of the Madrasa Management Committee or the people whose lives are being affected by the dissolution of the Madrasa Selection Commission, people are contacting us themselves, which we would put before you after a little investigation Huh
 hamen lagata tha ki hamaare bataane main koi chook hogi, magar abhi tak kisi bhi chayan ayog ne ye tak nahin kaha ki hamaari baat kis had tak galat he
 Everyone is waiting for the job series to stop soon so that everything will continue the same
 military ejineering sarvice kii pariksha paas karne ke baad 476 noujvaan jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 We also contacted for an answer but did not get a reply
 2015 main ssc-junior Engineer kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha
 The main examination took place on 24 July 2016, the result of which came on 16 December 2016
 dastavezon kii jaanch ke baad 9 oktober 2017 ko riselt bhi aa gaya
 The result of the examination, which was advertised in the year 2015, came in October 2017
 yani do saal to imtahaan main hi lag gaye
 After that, they have been waiting for joining for four and a half months
 in chaatro kaa kahana he ki unhen koi bataa nahin rahaa ki kab jwining hogi
 You will not believe that by passing the examination, even after coming on the merit list, these youngsters are sitting at home
 inhen koi bataane vaala nahin he
 1000 students selected for Assistant Audit Officer for CAG are waiting for joining after passing SSC examination
 esessisiechaesel 2015 kii pariksha paas kar department of industrial policy and promotion (dipp) main jwining ke liye 24 chaatr 7 maheene se intazaar kar rahe hai
 Students say that the general category has been joined but scheduled caste and OBC students are not joining
 aap soch rahe hai ki main ye ginati kyon kar rahaa hum, isliye kar rahaa hum taaki aapako pataa chal sake chaatr chaahe 24 kii sankhya main ho yaa 12,460 kii sankhya main, chayan aayogon par koi fark nahin padataa he
 At times, it seems that the government does not want to be reinstated, recruitments are removed when elections come and after that they are sometimes stuck in the name of copying court
 kya computer shikshak ke liye bhi bied kii degree anivaary hoti he, iskaa hamen kuch pataa nahin magar upi main 15 march ko alti grad ke 1500 computer shikshakon kii bahaali ai he usamen bied kii shart he
 It is not right for the students to say
 ham ejineering karne ke baad bied karne hi kyon jaaen
 We have no opinion on this, just keeping it here as information
 in chaatro kaa kahana he ki kendriya vidhyalay sanghathan, navoday vidhyalay or sena ke skulon main computer ke shikshake liye bied nahin hota he
 Often i have seen that restoration comes but sometimes new new conditions are added so that no one is found
 tippaniyan There is a Jaypee University in Chhapra, Bihar, people who have taken admission in BA in 2012 are still doing BA
 chaatr khud bataate hai ki 40,000 se adhik chaatr jepi uniwarsity ke chakkar main fanse hai
 Now, if 40,000 students cannot solve their problem together, then it should be understood that they and their family also do not want to pass BA before ten or twenty years
 ye bi aar ambedkar bihar vishvavidhyalay kaa langat singh college he
 a student of the 2016-19 batch here said that not a single year examination has been done so far
 kaayade se pratham varsh kii pariksha agast 2017 main ho jaani chahie thi magar vibhinn kaarnon se 2017 ke saal main is vishvavidhyalay main ek bhi pariksha nahin hui
 VC says that they have arrived 11 months ago and are busy fixing things
 chaatr sangh kaa chunaav or hadtaal ke kaaran 2017 zero year rahaa
 This university has about two lakh students
 is sankhya ke baad bhi agar chaatro kii ye haalat he to bahut dukhad he
 It seems that the parents of these students and the society of Bihar does not matter that their children are being ruined

 (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) pehali baar ye 3 november 2017 ko elahabaad hai court se jeet gaye
 The court said that these teachers should be admitted in two months
 3 janvari 2018 ko do maheene puure ho gaye magar 12,460 shikshak bahaali kaa intazaar karte rah gaye
 The case was then heard in the division bench
 vahaan se bhi ye 12,460 shikshak jeet gaye
 This time the High Court asked the UP government to start the recruitment process within 4 weeks
 6 march ko chaar hafte puure ho gaye
 On 15 March, they again came out on dharna demonstration
 2016 main 12,460 shikshakon kii bhartee kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha
 Its counseling continued till March 2017
 18 march 2017 tak saare zilon ke cat of gaye or merit list ban gai thi
 But on 23 March, the Yogi government banned these recruitments
 uske baad se ye noujvaan har maukey par pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Sometimes they sit, they fight in court
 yahaan tak ki 16 july 2017 se teen sitambar 2017 tak dhai maheene lakhanu ke lakshmana mela maidan main dharna bhi diya
 Many mlas and mps have also written letters to the government for these, yet they are not joining
 kendriya shram evam rojgaar mantri santosh kumaar gangavar ne bhi inke samarthan main patr likhaa he phir bhi inaki jwoining nahin ho rahi he
 Why is there a need to write a letter, even if there are two orders of the court, nothing is happening
 agar kuch ho rahaa he, to sarkaar ko in 12,460 naujavaanon ko bataa dena chahie ki uski taiyaari kis str par he or iraadaa kya he
 Is that why we are being postponed so that they don't have to pay a few more days or is there something else
 pashchim bengal se bhi hamen naukari siries ke liye lagaataar log likhte rahete hai or bengal ke sarvice kamishan kaa haal bataate rahete hai
 In the 13th episode of prime time, we had shown that the youth of Bengal are living unemployed destitute
 west bengal sarvice kamishan ko best bengal public sarvice kamishan main mila diya gaya tha
 Earlier there were separate commissions for recruitment of officers and staff, now there is only one
 malda jile main shikshakon kii bahaali ke liye chal rahe andolan ko 25 din se adhik ho chuke hai lekin unki koi sunwaayee nahin kar rahaa he or wo hamen lagaataar sandesh bhejte hai
 Similarly, on March 7, madrasa teachers held a demonstration in Kolkata
 isse pehle bhi kai baar andolan kar chuke hai
 Their problem is that they brought them to our NDTV office from Bengal
 sangharsh karte-karte bag main dastavezon kii file moti ho gai he
 These people are also fighting the case in the Supreme Court
 inhone bataaya ki west bengal madrasa sarvice kamishan 2008 main bana tha, iske tahat 614 sarkari madad praapt madrasa skool hai
 Seven lakh students study
 bengal ke kolkata madrasa kalege kii sthapana 1780 main hui thi
 Flocked out of it performing
 ye log bengal kii alag alag jagahon main kai baar pradarshan kar chuke hai
 They say that they have performed more than 600 performances in Bengal
 294 vidhayak or 42 saansad inke liye patr likh chuke hai
 Petition has been given to the Chief Minister
 ye sabhi puraani baaten hai jo unhone hi bataai hai
 The case is that between 2008 and 2013, there were 12,000 teachers reinstated in them, but the Madrasa Management Committee made the case that the Madrasa Commission did not have the right to reinstate teachers and this interfered with the autonomy of the minority institution
 management cameti chaahati thi ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 30 ke anusaar bahaali kaa adhikaar uske paas rahe
 Teachers say that management first used arbitrary restorations
 kamishan se bahaali hone par pratiyogita ke baad inaki merit list bani he
 The future of these teachers is at stake in the Madrasas Management Committee and the Madrasa Service Commission's legal battle
 kyonki 12 march 2014 ko hoicourt ne aadesh diya ki madrasa sarvice kamishan avaidh he
 Asked the commission not to make any kind of appointment
 kolkata hoicourt ke division bench ne bhi mana ki madrasa chayan ayog avaidh he or iske dwaara kii gai bahaaliyaan bhi avaidh hai
 Sword hangs on 12,000 teachers who were restored before this order
 ab supreme court ne do saal pehle hoicourt ke faisle par roak lagaate hue kaha ki riselt nikaal diya jaae
 The final decision did not come
 tab se is maamle ko kabhi hoicourt to kabhi supreme court chal rahaa he
 The next date in the Supreme Court is on 4 April
 hamen to pataa bhi nahin ki madrasa prabandhan samiti ke kya adhikaar hai yaa madrasa chayan ayog ko bhang kiye jane se kin logon kii zindagi prabhavit ho rahi he, log khud hi hamase sampark kar rahe hai jinhen ham thodi bahut jaanch ke baad aapke saamne rakh dete hai
 We thought that there would be a mistake in telling us, but so far no selection commission has said to what extent our point is wrong
 sab is intazaar main hai ki jaldi naukari series band ho jaae taaki phir sabakuch vaisaa hi chalata rahe
 After passing the Military Engineering Service exam, 476 youth are waiting for joining
 hamane jawaab ke liye sapanrk bhi kiya magar jawaab nahin mila
 In 2015, the advertisement of ssc-junior Engineer was released
 24 july 2016 ko mukhya pariksha hui jiskaa riselt 16 disambar 2016 ko aa gaya
 After scrutiny of documents, the result also came on 9 October 2017
 jis pariksha kaa vigyaapan 2015 ke saal main niklaa tha, uskaa nateeja aayaa oktober 2017 main
 That is, it took two years of examination
 uske baad ye saadhe chaar maheene se jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 These students say that no one is telling them when to join
 aap yakeen nahin karenge pariksha paas kar, merit list main aakar bhi ye noujvaan ghar baithe hue hai
 Nobody is going to tell them
 esayssi kii pariksha paas kar sieji ke liye sahaayak audit afasar ke liye chune gaye 1000 chaatr jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 24 students have been waiting for 7 months to join the department of industrial policy and promotion (dipp) by passing the SSCHSL 2015 exam
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki general catagori kii jwining ho gai he magar anusuchit jati or obisi chaatro kii jwining nahin ho rahi he
 You are wondering why i am doing this count, so i am doing it so that you can know whether the student is in the number of 24 or in the number of 12,460, there is no difference on the selection commissions
 kai baar lagata he ki sarkaar hi bahaali nahin karnaa chaahati he, chunaav aate hai to bhartiyon nikaal di jaati hai or uske baad kabhi court to kabhi nakal ke naam par inhen atka diya jaataa he
 We do not know whether bed degree is compulsory even for computer teacher, but in UP on March 15, 1500 computer teachers of LT grade have been reinstated, there is a condition of b
ed
 chaatro kaa kahana he yah thik nahin he
 Why should we go to b
ed after engineering
 hamaari koi raay nahin he is par, bas soochna ke taur par yahaan rakh rahaa hum
 These students say that there is no b
ed for computer education in Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, Navodaya Vidyalaya and Army schools
 aksar maine dekha he ki bahaali to aati he magar kai baar nai nai sharten jod di jaati hai taaki koi mili hi nahin

 inaki pareshaani kaa alam ye he ki wo inhen bengal se hamaare enditivi karyaalay le ai
 The file of documents in the bag has become thick while struggling
 ye log supreme court main bhi cese lard rahe hai
 He told that the West Bengal Madrasa Service Commission was formed in 2008, there are 614 government aided madrasa schools under it
 saat lakh chaatr padhate hai
 Kolkata Madrasa College in Bengal was established in 1780
 iske baahar hujum pradarshan kar rahaa he
 These people have performed several times in different places of Bengal
 inkaa kahana he ki ye bengal main 600 se adhik pradarshan kar chuke hai
 294 mlas and 42 mps have written letters for them
 mukhyamantri ko yachika di ja chuki he
 These are all old things that he has told
 maamla yah he ki 2008 se 2013 ke bich inamen 12,000 shikshakon kii bahaali hui thi lekin madrason kii prabandhan samiti ne hi cese kar diya ki madrasa kamishan ko shikshakon kii bahaali kaa adhikaar nahin he or yah alpsankhyak santhaan kii swaittata main dakhldanzi he
 The management committee wanted it to retain the right of reinstatement as per Article 30 of the Constitution
 shikshak kehete hai ki prabandhan pehle manamaane tareeke se behaal karata tha
 His merit list has been made after the competition on his reinstatement from the Commission
 madrason kii prabandhan samiti or madrasa sarvice kamishan kii kanoonee ladaai me in shikshakon kaa bhavishya daanv par he
 Because on 12 March 2014 the High Court ordered that the Madrasa Service Commission is illegal
 kamishan ko kaha ki wo kisi prakaar kii niyukti na kare
 The Division Bench of the Kolkata High Court also held that the Madrasa Selection Commission is illegal and the restorations made by it are also illegal
 is aadesh se pehle behaal ho chuke 12,000 shikshakon par talwaar latak gai he
 Now two years ago, the Supreme Court stayed the High Court ruling and said that the result should be removed
 antim faisla nahin aayaa
 Since then, the High Court is sometimes running the Supreme Court
 supreme court main agali taarikh 4 april ko padi he
 We do not even know what are the rights of the Madrasa Management Committee or the people whose lives are being affected by the dissolution of the Madrasa Selection Commission, people are contacting us themselves, which we would put before you after a little investigation Huh
 hamen lagata tha ki hamaare bataane main koi chook hogi, magar abhi tak kisi bhi chayan ayog ne ye tak nahin kaha ki hamaari baat kis had tak galat he
 Everyone is waiting for the job series to stop soon so that everything will continue the same
 military ejineering sarvice kii pariksha paas karne ke baad 476 noujvaan jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 We also contacted for an answer but did not get a reply
 2015 main ssc-junior Engineer kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha
 The main examination took place on 24 July 2016, the result of which came on 16 December 2016
 dastavezon kii jaanch ke baad 9 oktober 2017 ko riselt bhi aa gaya
 The result of the examination, which was advertised in the year 2015, came in October 2017
 yani do saal to imtahaan main hi lag gaye
 After that, they have been waiting for joining for four and a half months
 in chaatro kaa kahana he ki unhen koi bataa nahin rahaa ki kab jwining hogi
 You will not believe that by passing the examination, even after coming on the merit list, these youngsters are sitting at home
 inhen koi bataane vaala nahin he
 1000 students selected for Assistant Audit Officer for CAG are waiting for joining after passing SSC examination
 esessisiechaesel 2015 kii pariksha paas kar department of industrial policy and promotion (dipp) main jwining ke liye 24 chaatr 7 maheene se intazaar kar rahe hai
 Students say that the general category has been joined but scheduled caste and OBC students are not joining
 aap soch rahe hai ki main ye ginati kyon kar rahaa hum, isliye kar rahaa hum taaki aapako pataa chal sake chaatr chaahe 24 kii sankhya main ho yaa 12,460 kii sankhya main, chayan aayogon par koi fark nahin padataa he
 At times, it seems that the government does not want to be reinstated, recruitments are removed when elections come and after that they are sometimes stuck in the name of copying court
 kya computer shikshak ke liye bhi bied kii degree anivaary hoti he, iskaa hamen kuch pataa nahin magar upi main 15 march ko alti grad ke 1500 computer shikshakon kii bahaali ai he usamen bied kii shart he
 It is not right for the students to say
 ham ejineering karne ke baad bied karne hi kyon jaaen
 We have no opinion on this, just keeping it here as information
 in chaatro kaa kahana he ki kendriya vidhyalay sanghathan, navoday vidhyalay or sena ke skulon main computer ke shikshake liye bied nahin hota he
 Often i have seen that restoration comes but sometimes new new conditions are added so that no one is found
 tippaniyan There is a Jaypee University in Chhapra, Bihar, people who have taken admission in BA in 2012 are still doing BA
 chaatr khud bataate hai ki 40,000 se adhik chaatr jepi uniwarsity ke chakkar main fanse hai
 Now, if 40,000 students cannot solve their problem together, then it should be understood that they and their family also do not want to pass BA before ten or twenty years
 ye bi aar ambedkar bihar vishvavidhyalay kaa langat singh college he
 a student of the 2016-19 batch here said that not a single year examination has been done so far
 kaayade se pratham varsh kii pariksha agast 2017 main ho jaani chahie thi magar vibhinn kaarnon se 2017 ke saal main is vishvavidhyalay main ek bhi pariksha nahin hui
 VC says that they have arrived 11 months ago and are busy fixing things
 chaatr sangh kaa chunaav or hadtaal ke kaaran 2017 zero year rahaa
 This university has about two lakh students
 is sankhya ke baad bhi agar chaatro kii ye haalat he to bahut dukhad he
 It seems that the parents of these students and the society of Bihar does not matter that their children are being ruined
 veri sad
 (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) pashchim bengal se bhi hamen naukari siries ke liye lagaataar log likhte rahete hai or bengal ke sarvice kamishan kaa haal bataate rahete hai
 In the 13th episode of prime time, we had shown that the youth of Bengal are living unemployed destitute
 west bengal sarvice kamishan ko best bengal public sarvice kamishan main mila diya gaya tha
 Earlier there were separate commissions for recruitment of officers and staff, now there is only one
 malda jile main shikshakon kii bahaali ke liye chal rahe andolan ko 25 din se adhik ho chuke hai lekin unki koi sunwaayee nahin kar rahaa he or wo hamen lagaataar sandesh bhejte hai
 Similarly, on March 7, madrasa teachers held a demonstration in Kolkata
 isse pehle bhi kai baar andolan kar chuke hai
 Their problem is that they brought them to our NDTV office from Bengal
 sangharsh karte-karte bag main dastavezon kii file moti ho gai he
 These people are also fighting the case in the Supreme Court
 inhone bataaya ki west bengal madrasa sarvice kamishan 2008 main bana tha, iske tahat 614 sarkari madad praapt madrasa skool hai
 Seven lakh students study
 bengal ke kolkata madrasa kalege kii sthapana 1780 main hui thi
 Flocked out of it performing
 ye log bengal kii alag alag jagahon main kai baar pradarshan kar chuke hai
 They say that they have performed more than 600 performances in Bengal
 294 vidhayak or 42 saansad inke liye patr likh chuke hai
 Petition has been given to the Chief Minister
 ye sabhi puraani baaten hai jo unhone hi bataai hai
 The case is that between 2008 and 2013, there were 12,000 teachers reinstated in them, but the Madrasa Management Committee made the case that the Madrasa Commission did not have the right to reinstate teachers and this interfered with the autonomy of the minority institution
 management cameti chaahati thi ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 30 ke anusaar bahaali kaa adhikaar uske paas rahe
 Teachers say that management first used arbitrary restorations
 kamishan se bahaali hone par pratiyogita ke baad inaki merit list bani he
 The future of these teachers is at stake in the Madrasas Management Committee and the Madrasa Service Commission's legal battle
 kyonki 12 march 2014 ko hoicourt ne aadesh diya ki madrasa sarvice kamishan avaidh he
 Asked the commission not to make any kind of appointment
 kolkata hoicourt ke division bench ne bhi mana ki madrasa chayan ayog avaidh he or iske dwaara kii gai bahaaliyaan bhi avaidh hai
 Sword hangs on 12,000 teachers who were restored before this order
 ab supreme court ne do saal pehle hoicourt ke faisle par roak lagaate hue kaha ki riselt nikaal diya jaae
 The final decision did not come
 tab se is maamle ko kabhi hoicourt to kabhi supreme court chal rahaa he
 The next date in the Supreme Court is on 4 April
 hamen to pataa bhi nahin ki madrasa prabandhan samiti ke kya adhikaar hai yaa madrasa chayan ayog ko bhang kiye jane se kin logon kii zindagi prabhavit ho rahi he, log khud hi hamase sampark kar rahe hai jinhen ham thodi bahut jaanch ke baad aapke saamne rakh dete hai
 We thought that there would be a mistake in telling us, but so far no selection commission has said to what extent our point is wrong
 sab is intazaar main hai ki jaldi naukari series band ho jaae taaki phir sabakuch vaisaa hi chalata rahe
 After passing the Military Engineering Service exam, 476 youth are waiting for joining
 hamane jawaab ke liye sapanrk bhi kiya magar jawaab nahin mila
 In 2015, the advertisement of ssc-junior Engineer was released
 24 july 2016 ko mukhya pariksha hui jiskaa riselt 16 disambar 2016 ko aa gaya

 You are wondering why i am doing this count, so i am doing it so that you can know whether the student is in the number of 24 or in the number of 12,460, there is no difference on the selection commissions
 kai baar lagata he ki sarkaar hi bahaali nahin karnaa chaahati he, chunaav aate hai to bhartiyon nikaal di jaati hai or uske baad kabhi court to kabhi nakal ke naam par inhen atka diya jaataa he
 We do not know whether bed degree is compulsory even for computer teacher, but in UP on March 15, 1500 computer teachers of LT grade have been reinstated, there is a condition of b
ed
 chaatro kaa kahana he yah thik nahin he
 Why should we go to b

 The students themselves say that more than 40,000 students are caught in the affair of Jaypee University
 ab agar 40,000 chaatr milakar apni samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin kar sakate to phir yahi samajha janaa chahie ki ve or unke parivaar vaale bhi nahin chaahate hai das bees saal se pehle bie paas hon
 This is the Langat Singh College of BR Ambedkar Bihar University
 yahaan ke 2016-19 batch ke ek chaatr ne bataaya ki abhi tak ek bhi varsh kii pariksha nahin hui he
 Ideally, the first year examination should have been held in August 2017 but due to various reasons, there was not a single examination in this university in the year of 2017

 ) There is a Jaypee University in Chhapra, Bihar, people who have taken admission in BA in 2012 are still doing BA
 chaatr khud bataate hai ki 40,000 se adhik chaatr jepi uniwarsity ke chakkar main fanse hai
 Now, if 40,000 students cannot solve their problem together, then it should be understood that they and their family also do not want to pass BA before ten or twenty years
 ye bi aar ambedkar bihar vishvavidhyalay kaa langat singh college he
 a student of the 2016-19 batch here said that not a single year examination has been done so far
 kaayade se pratham varsh kii pariksha agast 2017 main ho jaani chahie thi magar vibhinn kaarnon se 2017 ke saal main is vishvavidhyalay main ek bhi pariksha nahin hui
 VC says that they have arrived 11 months ago and are busy fixing things
 chaatr sangh kaa chunaav or hadtaal ke kaaran 2017 zero year rahaa
 This university has about two lakh students
 is sankhya ke baad bhi agar chaatro kii ye haalat he to bahut dukhad he
 It seems that the parents of these students and the society of Bihar does not matter that their children are being ruined

 On the issue of civil nuclear agreement, the Indian side is watching the visit of Parobaama with a 'cautious optimism'
 bhartiya paksh ko ummid he ki america raashtrapati apni adhikaron kaa upyog karte hue parmaanu material ko trek karne kii america jid ko khatm karenge
 According to the agreement that the two countries are expected to reach, the US administration can accept India's policy of commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and the assurances of the International Atomic Energy Agency on the use of nuclear material
 gauratlab he ki pichley saptaah landan main donon deshon ke samoohon ke bich baithak hui thi lekin yahaan mahatvapurn prashasnic muddon par koi samjhauta nahin paaya tha
 After this, it was left to Barack Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take a final decision on this matter
 daavos main swiss vittamantri se mulaaqaat ke baad vittamantri arun jetali ne enditivi se ek khaas baatcheet main bataaya ki donon deshon ne kaala dhan kii jaankaree saajha karne kii disha main kuch behad achche kadam uthaae hai
 According to Jaitley, "the government of Switzerland is refusing to share information on the basis of stolen facts
" '' According to Swiss Bank, they will seek information only on the basis of independent evidence
 switzaraland ne bharat ko tex sambadhi soochna ke aadan-pradaan par puraa sahyog karne kaa bhi bharosa diya he, saath hi swiss bank main jamaa kaale dhan ke mudde par charchaa karne ke liye bhi sahmati jataai he
 This information has been given to the media after the meeting of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Switzerland Finance Minister Evelyn Widmer
 vittamantri arun jetali ke saath mulaakaat ke baad swiss vittamantri ne enditivi se baatcheet main kaha ki donon deshon ke vittamantriyon ke bich mulaakaat acchhee rahi or unhone saath milakar kuch achche kadam uthaae hai
 At the same time, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said during a conversation with NDTV that Switzerland has asked to share information on the issue of black money, but the Swiss government has categorically refused to share the information based on the stolen facts
 iske baad jetali ne kaha ki, bharat sarkaar puri tarah se swatantra sakshya ke aadhaar par hi switzaraland se jaankaree maangega
 Taking a jibe at the opposition's power show at the Brigade Parade Ground in Kolkata led by Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the grand alliance of opposition was not only against Modi but also against the people of the country is
 darasal centre kii modi sarkaar ke khilaaf mahagathbandhan kii kavayad jab se shuru hui he, tabhi se bijepi netaaon dwaara vibhinn manchon or media vimarsh main yah kaha ja rahaa he ki pradhanmantri modi ko haraane ke liye sabhi dal ek ho gaye hai
 The BJP is promoting the upcoming Lok Sabha election as "modi vs All"
 lekin pehla sawaal to yahi he ki ''modi vs ol" kii is tasviir main sachai kitni he? kya vaaki main puure desh main aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ''modi vs ol" ke aadhaar par hoga? shanivaar ko kolkata main vipaksh kii mahareli kii tasviir ne ek baar phir is vichaar ko majboot kiya he
 But this story can be seen hiding two facts
 pehla yah ki sansadeey vyavastha main rashtriya str par chunaav rajya str par lade ja rahe chunaav kaa nateeja hota he
 Secondly, BJP has got the same benefit of alliance in the states as its opposition parties
 yaad kiijie saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan modi-shah kii soshal engeering ke formule ke aage tamaam chote kshetreey dal bijepi ke saath gathbandhan ko taiyaar the
 This benefited the BJP at the local level and formed a BJP government with a strong majority at the center
 lekin 2019 kii siyaasi bisaat main kashmir se kanyakumari tak vibhinn rajyon kii sthiti par najar daalen to ''modi vs ol" ke peeche kii hakeekat saaf ho jaati he
 Uttar Pradesh - In the last general elections held in Uttar Pradesh, the country's largest state in terms of 80 seats, there was an alliance between BJP, Apna Dal and Om Prakash Rajbhar's party
 vahiin aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ke lihaaj se dekhen to upi main yah donon dal pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath ab bhi khadeyn hai
 On the other hand there is a coalition of SP-BSP-RLD
 jabaki congress akele chunaav lard rahi he
 In such a situation, there are two types of alliances in UP and if there is a single player, then it is the Congress and not the BJP
 bihar-40 sitadusre bade rajya bihar kii siyaasi hakeekat par najar daalen to yahaan aagaamee chunaav main bijepi, nitish kumaar kii jediu or ramvilas paswan kii algepi ke saath gathbandhan kaa elaan kar chuki he
 Not only this, BJP has given 17 seats to JDU with 2 mps here
 jabaki endie gathbandhan ke saamne congress, lalu yadav kii argedy, jithan ram maanjhi kii hindustan awam morcha, sharad yadav kii loktantric janata dal or vam dalon kaa gathbandhan he
 Hence, here too the election is not to be Modi vs All, but coalition vs alliance
 maharashtra-48 seatmaharashtra main bhi aagaamee chunaav main pehle se tay gathbandhan ke dalon ke bich muqabla he jaisaa ki 2014 main tha
 Where bjp-shiv Sena is on one side, congress-ncp on the other side
 haalanki shivasena bijepi or pradhanmantri modi ko lekar pichley kuch dinon se hamalavar he lekin congress-ensipi ko rokane ke liye donon dal gathbandhan barkaraar rakh sakate hai
 West Bengal - 42 In terms of seats in the country, if Prime Minister Modi stands alone in a big state, then it is West Bengal
 lekin yahaan muqabla modi vs ol na hokar modi vs mamata hoga
 Here the state unit of Congress, which fought the assembly elections with the Left parties, is yet to decide whether to go with the TMC or to contest the elections with the Left parties
 tamilnadu-39 sitatamilnadu main sattadhari ediemke centre main modi sarkaar kii sahyogi maani jaati he or ummid he ki film star rajnikant ke nae dal ke saath gathbandhan main chunaav lade
 However, the AIADMK recently opposed the Modi government on the issue of triple talaq bill
 jabaki duusari taraf diemke congress, vam dalon kaa gathbandhan he or yah mana ja rahaa he ki film star camel hasan kii nai party bhi is gathbandhan main shaamil hogi
 In this context, Tamil Nadu is also likely to be a coalition versus alliance or alliance versus AIADMK versus BJP and not Modi versus All
 kerala-20 sitakerala main ek taraf left kaa gathbandhan ldf he to duusari taraf congress ke netritv main udief khadi he, vahiin teesraa kone bijepi gathbandhan kaa he
 And all three are fighting against each other
 lihaaja yaha bhi modi vs ol nahin he
 Karnataka is the only state in Karnataka-29 citadesh where it can be said that the contest here is Modi vs Alliance
 yahaan vidhansabha chunaav main akele ladi congress or jedies bijepi ko rokane ke liye saath main sarkaar chalaa rahe hai
 It is believed that both parties will contest the Lok Sabha elections together
 purvottar-25 sitapurvottar ke aath rajyon kii baat karen to yahaan bhi bijepi yaa uski sahyogi kshetreey dal satta main hai
 In terms of seats, the bjp-bodo People's Front in the northeastern largest state of Assam is a contest between the alliance versus the Assam Gana Parishad versus the Congress versus Badruddin Ajmal's All India Democratic Front
 assam gana parishad isse pehle bijepi kii sahyogi rahi he, lekin citijanship amendament bill ko lekar usne samarthan waapas le liye
 While Badruddin Ajmal has spoken of an alliance with the Congress
 bijepi kii sahyogi dal neshnal pipuls party jo ki meghalaya or manipur main saajha sarkaar chalaa rahi he, ne akele chunaav ladane kaa faisla liya he
 In other states of the Northeast, the BJP is either fighting the Congress or regional parties
 is liye yahaan bhi modi vs ol kaa seen nahin ban rahaa
 Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh-65 seats Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan have been a direct contest in the Congress and BJP since the beginning
 lekin yahaan bhi kshetreey dal alag-alag chunaav lard rahe hai
 SP, BSP and Gondwana Ganatantra Party contested separate elections in Madhya Pradesh in the recent assembly elections
 rajasthan main bhi bhartiya tribal party, bispi or hanuman beniwal kii party akele chunaav ladi thi
 Whereas in Chhattisgarh, there was an alliance between Ajit Jogi's party and BSP
 lihaaja in rajyon main congress-bijepi ke bich mukhya muqabla hone ke baavjood kshetreey dal in donon partiyon se lard rahe hai
 Therefore, there does not seem to be a picture of Modi vs All here
 punjab, haryana, dilli-30 sitchhote rajyon kii baat karen to punjab main congress akele khadi he, duusari taraf bijepi-akali kaa gathbandhan he to vahiin teesraa kone aam aadmi party kaa he
 Hence the contest here will be Congress vs bjp-akali vs AAP and not Modi vs All
 dilli kii baat karen to yahaan bhi congress, bijepi or aam aadmi party teenon dal ek-duusare se ladate hue dikh rahe he
 Whereas Haryana's contest is triangular in which there is a contest between Congress, BJP and INLD
 to yah muqabla modi vs ol kaise hua? There is a strange news from Johannesburg, South Africa
 pichley dinon shahar ke mukhya ilaake se achaanak ek flats se madad maangane kii aawaaj aane lagi, jo thodi hi der main cheekh main badal gai
 a huge crowd of people gathered outside the house, after which the police came and settled the case
 bataaya jaataa he ki log us aurat ko dekhne ke liye jamaa ho gaye, jo apane pati ko dhokhaa de rahi thi
 But during sex, her lover's sex got stuck in the private part of the woman
 british akhbaar 'daily mail' ke mutabik, sasha nagma (34) apane pati ke offis jane ke baad premi sol cobojo (22) ke saath flats main shaareerik sambandh bana rahi thi, lekin charam sukh praapt karne ke baad sol kaa ling mahila ke privet part main funs gaya
 At first, they tried their best to get it out, but when it didn't work out, they started calling for help and then shouting
 jaadu-tone kaa asarsthaneey logon or media kii khabaron ke mutabik, ek jaadu-tona karne vaali mahila kaa daawa he ki aisa uske jaadu ke kaaran hua he
 According to the woman, Sasha's husband Neil (42) suspected the wife and therefore wanted to hold her red-handed
 aise main nil ne jaaduugarani se sampark kiya, jiske baad usne ek mantra diya
 Because of this, Sasha's lover's penis gets trapped and he will not come out until Neil arrives
 sasha ke ek padosi priskila (34) ne bataaya ki usne pehle flats se kuch awaajen suni, use laga ki donon prem main leen hai
 But within a short time the voice of help started coming and then there was a scream
 priskila ne kaha, 'jab maine darwaja kholaa to dekha ki sasha kaa premi uske upar leta hua he ore donon madad ke liye chilla rahe hai
 The gathering of two thousand people told that the news of this incident spread like fire, and around 2000 people gathered on the spot
 baad main ambulance bulaayaa gaya or donon ko aspataal le jaaya gaya, jahaan donon kii samasya kaa samaadhaan hua
 Doctors say that many times during sex such an exception occurs
 iske peeche kii vajah yah he ki mahila ke privet part kaa andruni hissaa ragad ke kaaran akad jaataa he or apwaad ke taur par aisi ghatana ho jaati he

 Somdev Devvarman of India, who recently retired from Professional Tennis, has flashed on the All India Tennis Association
 somdev ne eitie ko lambii chitthee likhi he
 In fact, young tennis player Sumit Nangal has been excluded from the recently selected Davis Cup team
 eitie ke sutron ne nangal ko baahar rakhane kii vajah unka kharaab vyavhaar bataaya

 Does anyone in the Sangh know why Nangal was not available for selection? Nangal is struggling with a shoulder injury
 wo khud uski fitness par uske saath kaam kar rahe hai
 But instead of taking care of one of its budding players, the Sangh is giving such news about him
 somdev ne likhaa ki agar nangal ne kuch galat kiya bhi tha to usase team ke captain anand amritraj ne deal kiya or uske baad sumit ne wo galtiyaan doharaai bhi nahin

 'da don' akhbaar ne apni website par likhaa he, jaanch agency ke mahanideshak saud mirza ne kaha ki jaanch kii prakriya ke tahat kuch naukarshahon ke bayaan darj kiye ja chuke hai

 The SIT probing the journalist Gauri Lankesh murder case has also questioned the people of Sanatan Sanstha
 is sanstha kaa naam govind pansaare, kalburgi or dabholkar kii hatya main bhi saamne aayaa tha
 Indeed, the SIT suspects that people who have been Kannada litterateur M
 em
 Kalburgi was killed, the same people have killed Gauri Lankesh

 According to 'the Indian Express' news, journalist Gauri Lankesh got 7
 65 mm pistal se goli maari gai thi
 Kalburgi also 7
 65 mm pistal se goli maari gai
 It would be surprising to know that 7 killed in February 16, 2015 in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, also killing leftist thinker Govind Pansare (81)
 65 mm pistal kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 An investigation team official said that Narendra Dabholkar (69) was killed in Pune on August 20, 2013 from a pistol used in Pansare's murder
 beete dinon karnataka ke grih mantri ramalinga reddy ne bhi kaha tha ki gauri lankesh murder cese kii jaanch kar rahi esaiti ko kuch mahatvapurn suraag mili hai
 The killers will soon be under police arrest
 gauri lankesh ko shaam ke samay goli maari gai, jabaki kalburgi, pansaare or dabholkar ko subah ke samay maut ke ghat utaara gaya
 The reason behind killing Gauri Lankesh in the evening could be that she did not leave the house during the day
 cese kii tafteesh main juty esaiti philhal har angel se maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Karnataka-based Sanatan Sanstha and HJS activists are on the radar of the investigation team
 jaanch team yah bhi shaq jataa rahi he ki kya in hatyaon ke liye supaari kilors ko hair kiya gaya
 The investigation team is scrutinizing the list of people staying in hotels, lodges in Bangalore recently

 bhartiya team champions trophy ke final main apane chir pratidandvi pakistan ke aage buree tarah se fail rahi
 India's batting, bowling, fielding were all worse than Pakistan in this match played on Sunday
 yahi kaaran tha ki team india 180 ranon se haari
 On the one hand, where the whole team India failed, on the other hand there were two players of the team who gave a tough fight to Pakistan and managed to save some respect

 All beaten up, Bhuvi kept fighting, the batsmen of the Kopakistan team were in their full color, every batsman had to swear that something had to be done today
 vahiin duusari ore bhartiya bowler bhi lagaataar galati kar rahe the, bumraah ne fakhar ko out kiya lekin vah gend bhi no-ball nikali
 Apart from this, the ashwin-jadeja pair could not work

 Bhuvneshwar conceded 44 runs for 10 overs and took 1 wicket
