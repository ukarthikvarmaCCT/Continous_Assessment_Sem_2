 r Ashwin, the No
1 bowler in the ICC rankings, is raining records in every match
 haal hi main australia ke khilaaf hue duusare test main bhi unhone shandaar pradarshan karte hue bhartiya sarajameen par apane 200 wicket puure kiye
 Along with this, he also scored the fastest 25 times in Test cricket, taking 5 wickets in an innings
 aswin pichley kuch samay se lagaataar apni gendon par duniya ke bade se bade ballebaajon ko nachaa rahe hai
 If this great performance of Ashwin continues then he can name many more records
 ham aapako bataane ja rahe hai, aakhir wo koun-koun se records hai, jinako aswin apni phiraki se tod sakate hai
 
 
 If the record of taking the most wickets in a series is to be talked about, then it is the name of England's bowler Sydney Barnes, who has the world record of taking the most wickets in a series
 jinhone dakshin africa ke khilaaf 1913-14 main chaar test maichon kii siries main sabase zyaada 49 wicket lene kaa world record banaaya tha
 The Indian record for the highest number of wickets in a series is named after leg-spinner Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, who took 35 wickets in the five-test home series against England in 1973–74
 haalanki aswin dakshin africa ke khilaaf 2015 kii gharelu test siries main chandrashekhar ke is record kii barabari se sirf 4 wicket peeche rah gaye the
 Looking at Ashwin's great record on Indian soil, he has many opportunities in the coming times in which he can break this record
 karier main sabase zyaada 5 wicket haul or match main 10 wicket lene kaa bhartiya recordbharat kii ore se test maichon main sabase zyaada 5 wicket haul or match main 10 wicket lene kaa bhartiya record anil kumble ke naam he jinhone apane karier main 35 baar 5 wicket haul or 8 baar match main 10 wicket hasil karne kaa karnama kiya he
 Ashwin has played only 47 Tests in which he has taken 5 wickets in 25 times and 10 wickets in 7 matches
 itane kam maichon main itnaa shandaar record rakhane vaale aswin ke liye is record kii barabari karnaa mumkin lagata he
 The record for taking the fastest 300 wickets in Tests is to be recorded for taking the fastest 300 wickets in Test cricket, it is in the name of Australian bowler Dennis Lillee, who set a world record with 300 wickets in 56 Tests
 aswin test maichon main ab tak kul 269 wicket le chuke hai
 These figures suggest that Ashwin is not far from breaking this record
 gauratlab he kii haal hi main bangladesh ke viruddh aswin ne sabase kam45 maichon main sabase tej 250 wicketlekar lily ke kii record ko todaa tha, jinhone 48 maichon main 250 wicket puure kiye the
 Anil Kumble has played 271 ODI matches for India in which he has taken 337 wickets
 aswin ne mahaz 105 vanade maichon main 145 wicket chatkaaye hai
 Given this magnificent record, it is possible that Ashwin will also achieve this record of one-day wickets of Kumble in the final phase of his career

 bataa den ki akhilesh raaj main kabristaanon kii gheraabandi ko bijepi ne 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bada mudda banaaya tha
 In this regard, all the big and small leaders of BJP attacked the Samajwadi Party fiercely
 ab yogi sarkaar bhi usee raah par kadam badha die hai
 BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi says that "we have never opposed the siege of cemeteries but we have certainly criticized the duplicity policy of Akhilesh government
 kabristaan ke liye to unke paas paisa tha lekin shmashaan ghaaton ke liye unhone kuch nahin kiya
 He said that we want Ramlila grounds, which have reached a state of disrepair, to be repaired and their boundary walls should be built as soon as possible

 This is a routine job, the government should do it
 ramlila maidan se zyada jaruri is vakt rajya main bad rahe mahilaon par atyaachaar or samudaayon ke bich fail rahi nafrat bade mudde hai
 The Yogi government is not doing anything about them

 pakistani khufia agency iesai ke karname bhala jaise bhi hon
 But Pakistan's criticism of the ISI is not the least and that is why Pakistan has banned its cable operators from showing promos of Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif's new film Ek Tha Tiger
 darasal pakistan ko 'ek tha tiger film' ke bare main aisi jaankariyaan milin ki is film ke jariye iesai kii image ko kharaab karne kii koshish kii jaaegi
 Then what was the promo of this film was banned in Pakistan

 So do not show promos or reviews of all channel-ek Tha Tiger
 ye maamla desh kii chhavi se judaa he, isliye isamen kisi bhi kism kii kotahi nahin kii jaae
 It is clear how much Pakistan cares about the image of its intelligence agency

 First, by banning 'agent Vinod' and now 'ek Tha Tiger', Pakistan has made it clear that whatever the film may be, but do not discredit the name of ISI

 Many kiss scenes were shot between Vidya and Imran in 'ghanachakkar'

 After almost every kiss scene, he used to ask, what do you think Siddharth (siddharth Roy Kapur) would say after seeing this scene? Do you think they will give me my payment check? After every scene they used to worry only about what Siddharth would say and i used to think why he is asking me this after every scene

 Railway PRO Neeraj Sharma said that platform tickets will be closed from Monday in view of festivals, as well as orders have been given to scouts, civil defense and railway police to avoid any untoward incident like Mumbai stampede that no one on the bridge Stopped
 kahin bhi jhund ikattha hone se pehle hi use tatkaal platform kii taraf ravaanaa kar diya jaae
 According to the PRO, 20 new public and convenience trains are being introduced in view of the festivals
 suvidha train kii khaasiyat yah he ki isamen turant tatkaal tikat liya ja saktaa he duusari tarafjan saadhaaran main koi bhi tikatalekar saadhaaran kiraye par yatra kar saktaa he
 It is evident that the railways have an important role in reducing the distance of festival and employment, which translates into a big responsibility in this particular season
 aise main ye sunishchit karnaa sabase zyada aavashyak he ki rail musafiron ko unke gantavy tak salaamati se pahunchaae taaki chhath ke ugte suraj ko dekha ja sake or deepawali ke diye ko raushan kiya ja sake
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, reiterating his demand for special state status and special assistance to Bihar
 pradhanmantri ko shanivaar ko likhe apane patr main nitish ne kaha ki apni ukt maang ko patron ke madhyam se athwa antarraji parishad evam niti ayog kii vibhinn baithkon main centre sarkaar ke samaksh rakhaa he
 He has said that after the independence of the country, there has been a lot of variation in the experience of the states from the point of view of development
 jahaan kai rajyon ko teji se vikaas hua he, vahiin kai anya rajya abhaav se grasit rahe hai
 Financial transfers of the Planning Commission and the Finance Commission have also failed to bridge this gap between states
 nitish ne kaha ki bihar jaise rajyon ko iskaa baari khamiaja bhugatna padaa he
 Developed states have benefited from the direct and indirect grants of the central government
 is kaaran se kshetreey asantulan ko badhaava mila he tathaa desh ke vikaas main tapu srujit ho gaye hai
 He said that it is a matter of concern for a backward state like Bihar that Bihar's share in the total amount is 10, based on the formula given by the 14th Finance Commission for the allocation of funds between states
 9 pratishat se ghatakar 9
 7 percent

 Nitish said that instead of encouraging Bihar's efforts to increase green cover, it has been neglected
 iske atirikt prayek varsh nepal se aane vaali nadiyon main aane vaali baadh se jaan evam maal kii vyapak kshati bhi rajya par vittiya boj daalati he
 Bihar is extremely backward in terms of physical and social infrastructure and its per capita income is much lower than the national average
 bihar rajya kii in vishesh aavashyaktaaon ko bhi dekhen jane kii zarurat he
 In a letter to the Prime Minister, Nitish Kumar has said that on the basis of the recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission to increase the share to be transferred from 32 per cent to 42 per cent to the states, the amount to be given to the states in the Centrally Sponsored Schemes in the Union Budget
 There has been a considerable reduction in the adverse impact on Bihar
 unhone kaha ki 14wein vitt ayog kii anushansa ke viruddh agar vaastavik prapti ko dekha jaye to kar antaran ke tahat anushansit raashi ke viruddh kaaphi kam raashi rajya ko praapt ho rahi he
 In the year 2015-16, this reduction was about 7 thousand 400 crores and in the year 2016-17, it was about 6 thousand crores

 Due to this, regional imbalances have been encouraged and islands have been created in the development of the country

 The Finance Commission has given priority to the area and abundance of natural forests, while ignoring the problems of overpopulation like Bihar and specific problems of Thalaruddha state
 nitish ne kaha ki bihar dwaara harith aavaran ko badhaaye jane ke prayaas ko protsaahit karne ke bajaay uski upeksha kii gai he
 Apart from this, extensive loss of life and goods due to floods in the rivers coming from Nepal every year also puts financial burden on the state
 bihar bhautik evam saamaajik aadharbhoot sanrachana kii drushti se atyant pichhadaa he or yahaan kii prati vyakti aay rashtriya ausat se kaaphi kam he
 These special needs of the state of Bihar also need to be seen

 He said that if the actual receipts are seen against the recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission, then the state is receiving a very small amount against the amount recommended under the tax transfer
 varsh 2015-16 main yah kami lagbhag 7 hajaar 400 karod rupee kii thi or varsh 2016-17 main lagbhag 6 hajaar karod rupee kii
 He said that despite achieving double digit growth rate in the past several years, Bihar's main parameters of development like poverty line per capita income are behind the national average in industrialization and social and physical infrastructure
 bihar ko ek samay seemaa main pichhadepan se ubaarane or rashtriya ausat ke samakaksh laane ke liye nawachaari soch ke tahat aavashyak nitigat dhaancha taiyaar karne kii tatkaal aavashyaktaa he
 Bihar is the state with the highest population density with a very low per capita income
 nitish ne kaha he ki varsh 2015-16 ke aankadon ke anusaar bihar kii prati vyakti aay sthir mulyon (2011-12) par 26801 rupee he jabaki rashtriya ausat 77435 rupee he
 Therefore, the state's per capita income is only 34 of the national average
 6 pratishat he
 Nitish has written in a letter to the Prime Minister that at the time of the bifurcation of the state of Bihar, a provision was made in the Bihar Reorganization Act 2000 that a special treasury was set up under the direct control of the Deputy Chairman Planning Commission in the context of the financial difficulties facing Bihar as a result of the partition
 And she will make special recommendations as per the requirements of Bihar
 is praavdhaan ke aanshik anupaalan main biarjief ke tahat is rajya ko kuch sahaayta di ja rahi thi jisamen gat varshon main maang ke anuroop raashi nahin di ja rahi he jisase yojanaon ke kriyanvayan main bhi pratikul prabhaav padaa he or rajya ko apane sansadhano se raashi uplabdh karaani pad rahi he
 Nitish said that it is in this context that i would like to draw attention to the recommendations of the Raghuram Rajan Committee set up by the Central Government in which he presented the Composite Development Index for the states
 iske anusaar desh ke 10 sarvaadhik pichde rajyon ko chinhit kiya gaya tha
 These states also include Bihar
 prativedan main ullekh kiya gaya tha ki sarvaadhik pichde rajyon kii vikaas kii gati badhaane ke liye kendra sarkaar anya rup main kendriya sahaayta uplabdh kara sakati he
 However, no action has been taken on these recommendations from the Central Government level
 tippaniyan He said that in this background we demand that Bihar should get special state status
 rajya ko vishesh darja milane se jahaan ek ore kendra pryojit yojana main kendransh ke pratishat main vruddhi hoti jisase rajya ko apane sansadhano kaa upyog anya vikaas evam kalyankari yojanaon main karne kaa avasar miltaa vahiin duusari ore pratyaksh evam apratyaksh karon main chhot se nijee nivesh ke pravaah ko gati milti jisase yuvaaon ke liye rojgaar ke nae avasar srujit honge
 Nitish has said that Bihar wants to contribute to the progress of the country by removing its backwardness
 hamaari vishesh rajya ke darje kii maang isi soch par aadhaarit he
 Therefore, in this background, there is a request that Bihar should be given special status and special assistance

 Kashmiri Hindus, mainly families with the names of Sapru and Dhar, perform havan in the name of Mata Roop Bhavani in the month of Krishna Paksha and make kheer as prasad in the house
 bachapan se hi meri daadi is din kheer banaati thi or upwas rakhti thi, saath main hi dadaji bhi upwas rakhte the
 Once i asked why do you eat kheer on this day and why do you keep everyone fast? Everyone told that 'sahib hanj satam' means Roop Bhavani, the Goddess of Kashmir, who is also known as Akleshwari
 devi rup bhavani kaa janm jyeshtha puuranamasi varsh 1621 dhar parivaar main hua
 a Kashmiri Hindu named Madhav Zu Dhar was a very religious and philosophical person and a worshiper of Mother Sharika i
e
 Shakti
 kashmir kaa haari parvat mandir jise chakreshwari bhi kaha jaataa he, jahaan shakti kaa rup ek vishaal parvat shila ke rup main he
 It is said that when the demons started harassing the local people very much, the goddess took the form of myna and saved the people from those demons, Devi as Sheela is seated and covered with vermilion
 madhav ju apane din kii shuruyaat devi ke darshan se hi karte the
 Everyday in Brahma Muhurta, they worshiped there and worshiped Mother Sharika for hours
 aisa kaha jaataa he madhav ju navaratri ke pehle din asina maheene varsh 1620 main madhyaraatri ko puja archana karne pahunche
 It is believed that seeing her devotion, the goddess appeared to her as a little girl, Madhav Joo was very happy to see the girl and her devotional spirit spilled in tears, he understood that Sakshat Devi appeared to him
 is
 unhone charnon main phool arpit kiye or mithai di
 Devi was very happy to see his simplicity
 
 Madhav Xu requested Devi to be born as a daughter in his house and only after that Roop Bhavani was born and was named Akleswari
 akleshwari kaa bachapan maa sharika ke bhakton or bhakthi main beetaa
 Madhav Joo was so absorbed in spirituality that people used to come from far and wide to see him
 bachapan se hi akleshwari unhen dekhte hue badi ho rahi thim
 As his age was increasing, his spiritual knowledge was also increasing, his father Madhav Xu was his mentor who showed him the path of spirituality and initiated him
 aleshwari kaa vivaah sapru parivaar main hua
 It is said that their married life was very painful
 unka vivaah hiranand sapru se hua jo akleshwari ke aadhyatm gyaan ko samaj hi nahin paae
 His mother-in-law Snake Kunj also showed no interest in this gesture and eventually gave him only and only sorrows and only drawbacks
 madhya raatri ko akleshwari mata sharika kii puja archana ke liye jaatin thi par hiranand ko kuch shaq hone laga to wo unka peechha karte-karte mandir pahunche, jab akleshwari ne unhen dekha to unhen devi kii aradhana ke liye aamantrit kiya achaanak un donon ke bich ek jharnaa-sa ban gaya or hiranand ko waapas lautnaa padaa
 Once Madhav Joo sent kheer in a pot here at Akleshwari and on this too his mother-in-law Snake Kunj got angry and started saying that this kheer is less how will i give it to all relatives? Akleshwari asked to distribute the bus and it is said that she kept distributing kheer, that is why this day is a caste made kheer
 akleshwari ne vitasta (jhelum) ke us paar bhakthi bhav main leen apane pita ko mataka lautaaya
 She had to leave her husband after suffering a lot in the in-laws and understood the life of spirituality as the meaning of life
 unhone jahaan-jahaan bhi sadhana kii, unka saamana anek bhakton se hua
 When Akhileshwari was pleased with Gawale, Lal Chandra did a lot of service to Akaleshwari, but Akleshwari left the village to find solitude and started living in a hut on the banks of the river Shakol
 kabhi kisi netraheen vyakti ko thik karnaa or aise anek chamatkaar jise dekhakar bhavani ke bhakt chaunk jate the
 Once someone asked him his name, Bhavani said 'roop' which means 'self realization', that's why he is called 'roop Bhawani'
 bhavani ke bhai laal ju ne bhavani ke saamne bete ko shikshit karne kii maang kii or jab bhavani ne use kalam or panna diya to wo bas likhata chalaa gaya likhata chalaa gaya
 The words of Bhavani are called Vakh which is in Kashmiri
 mata rup bhavani kaa mandir / ashram jammu ke talab tillo main he
 Kashmir, the land of spiritualism, has experienced the incarnations of saints and deities, one such incarnation was 'roop Bhavani', which even today the Kashmiri Hindu family considers their purpose to be Ganannan Akash Vani Nervanpanai Sahai Than Thanai Chhuyaram Only Ram Speak Bei memanj chuya ha ih ll The exact example of harmony has been presented in accordance with the concept of Shaivism of Kashmir of God and devotion
 If you take the name of it, the form of Brahman itself is attained
 vastav main ram hamaare jivan ke aadhaar rahe hai
 They are part of our lifestyle and culture
 shiv ek sarvakalik abhibhavak kii tarah hamaari raksha karte hai
 These are helpful in our moments

 Shiva makes immediate diagnosis as soon as he hears the prayer without delay, so Rama and Shiva are not separate at all

 He told that while going from Nakatalla to Garia, the drain under Alipur Bridge, which smells terrible, is also Adi Ganga
 jisko sthaneey log toli canal kehete hai
 Actually, till two hundred years ago, Adi Ganga was a tributary of Hooghly
 haalanki iskaa itihaas thodaa or purana he
 But when it was losing its form in the eighteenth century, between 1772 and 1777, William Tolley revived it and started using it as a canal and a stream of transport
 baharhaal, ganga kii yah dhara kolkata main badhati aabaadi, badhate laalach or badhate shaharikaran ke swaabhaavik nateezon kaa shikaar hui or ab yah gharon ke sivej dhoti hui naale main badal gai he
 In the British era, this canal was maintained properly because at that time the rivers had a significant role in transportation, but after independence it too was destroyed like the rest of the heritage
 na to isamen pani ke bahaav kii dekharekh kii gai, na hi khatm hote pani ke bahaav ko bachaae rakhane kii koi jarurat mahasoos kii gai
 During the tide, the water of Hooghly used to come in considerable quantity and also brought a lot of silt along with it
 natijatan, yah nadi gaad se bharti gai
 The bottom of this river kept rising
 shahar bada hua to kolkata municipal corporation ke naale berokatoke isamen girte rahe
 The corporation did not have any mechanism to control the water coming into this drain at the time of tide and ebb
 kabhi 75 kilometre lambii rahi yah aadi ganga aaj kii taarikh main kai jagahon se lupt ho chuki he
 However, according to media reports, efforts were also made to revive it and after 1990, about 200 crore rupees have been spent in the activities to restore it
 aadi ganga ko lekar hua ek ek shodh bataata he ki bandel ke najadik, tribeny (triveni) main ganga teen hisson main bant jaati he
 a stream flows in the Saraswati, south-west direction towards Saptagram
 duusari dhara jiskaa naam jamuna he, dakshin-purv disha main bahati he or teesri dhara hughali bich main bahati hui aage chalakar kolkata main pravesh karke aadi ganga main milakar kalighat, baruipur or magara hoti hui samudr main ja milti thi
 Relying on many ancient articles and maps, Adi Ganga was the main stream and due to this Kolkata became a major port in the British era
 lekin lagbhag 1750 main sankarail ke najadik haavda main saraswati nadi ke nichle hisse ko hughali nadi se jodne ke liye aadi ganga kii dhara ko kaat diya gaya
 And for this reason most of the water flow became northwest and Hooghly became the main stream of Ganga, which is still today
 baharhaal, 19veen sadi ke uttarardh main british adhikari dablyoodablyoo hunter ne likhaa he ki is (adiganga) puraani nadi ko hi hindu asli ganga maanate hai
 Those who burn the dead of their people in pokhars built on the banks of this river
 jaahir he, chitaayen jalaane ko lekar hunter us parampara kii ore ishaara kar rahe the jiske tahat ganga ke kinare jalaae jane se moksh milane kii manyata he
 As Adi Ganga began to move away from the city in the 1770s, William Tolley was surprised to see the flow of the 15 km stream from Garia to Samukpota and connected the Adi Ganga to the Vidyadhari river flowing towards the Sundarbans
 or aaj isi vajah se yah dhara tolinala naam se janaa jaataa he
 Earlier the river used to flow through Boral, Rajpur, Harinvi and Baruipur on the banks of Sundavan, its flow was getting blocked fast
 haalanki yah 1940 ke dashak tak naavon ke jariye maal dhulaai kaa kaaphi bada saadhan tha
 Even around 1970, people who collected honey from the Sundarbans crossed the river and parked their boats under a bridge leading to Talliganj, a busy suburb of South Kolakala
 baharhaal, aaj kii taarikh main aadi ganga logon ke laalach kii shikaar ho gai he
 In it you will see encroachments like plastic bags, garbage, garbage, hasting (confluence of Hooghly) to Garia (tool drain) 15 km 7,851 illegal constructions, 40,000 houses, 90 temples, 69 godowns and 12 animal sheds (figure 1998 Is, and was considered by the Government of West Bengal in the High Court)
 aapako agar isamen nahin dikhegaa to pani
 At the moment, the river disappears as it goes ahead of Garia
 narendrapur or raajpur-sonapur se lagbhag teen kimi aage aadi ganga dikhaai nahin detii
 And instead of its roof, pucca houses, community buildings and roads are visible
 uske paas kuch bade talab dikhaai dete hai jinke karer ganga, ghosar ganga jaise naam hai
 Apparently, these were also ponds formed from the water of Adi Ganga and their names also prove this
 in dinon aap desh main baadh kii khabaren dekh rahe honge ki desh kaa purvi ilaaka kaise isse halkaan he
 But Adi Ganga's death exemplifies how the expanding city has swallowed the river
 kabhi fursat ho to sochiega

 neshnal green tribunel (NGT) ne dilli - ensiaar memphogingyani machhar maarane kii dawa ke chhidkaav ko gaiyr jaruri bataaya he
 The NGT court has said that the government works only for spraying
 darasal, chhidkaav ke dushprabhavon ko lekar do saal pehle lagaai gai yachika par die aadesh ke dauraan engiti ne ye baaten kahi hai
 Opening the poll of Civic Agencies, the tribunal said, "the government wants to show that it is doing something for the safety of the public, which is why the sprinklers are being done
" jabaki vastav main yah sirf ek manovaigyanik asar hi daal paati he ki chhidkaav ke baad log surakshit hai
 "not spraying sprinkles," Mertecourt has said that spraying outside the house not only costs the government a large amount of money, but also threatens environmental pollution to traffic jams and arson incidents
 court ne apane aadesh main saaf kar diya he ki sarkaar or civik agency sirf logon ke ai wash ke liye chhidkaav kar rahi hai, usase machhar nahin marate
 The NGT has also said that mosquitoes still die from spraying inside the house, but spraying on the streets outside the houses only pollutes the environment
 usamen chhidkaav karne ke liye badi maatra main chemicals kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he jo paryaavaran main khulkar hamaari saanso tak pahunchate hai
 Mosquitoes, which are the originators of diseases like dengue, chikungunya and malaria, run away as soon as they are outdoor fogging
 court ne kaha he ki foging kii bajaay civik agenciyon ko kooday ke nistaaran or jagah-jagah jamaa hone vaale pani ko rokane ke upaay karne chahie
 Order to appoint 12 local commissioners: The court has also appointed 12 local commissioners, giving orders in this matter
 inaki jimmedaari dilli ke alag-alag jilon main yah sunishchit karne kii hogi ki vahaan machhar naa panape
 Apart from this, the NGT has instructed the MCD that it will give the details of the officer and employee of each area on the website
 is byore main uskaa naam or sampark ke liye phone number maujuud hoga
 With this, ordinary people will be able to call the MCD officer directly connected to their area for their problem
 iske alaava emsidi ke adhikariyon ne kin- kin jagahon par kaam kiya or uske kya nattejey nikle, yah bhi website par bataanaa hoga
 While disposing of the petition, the court has directed the government and civic agencies that the committee formed on the orders of the NGT will keep an eye on measures and efforts to prevent mosquitoes
 bataa den ki pichley kai saalon main dilli - ensiaar main machharon ke panpane se dengue chikangunia or malaria jaisi bimariyon se saikadon log apni jaan gavaa chuke hai jabaki hajaaron log isaki chapet main aa chuke hai

 What is the relationship between Dashanan and Asaram? One is the demon king of Treta Yuga and the other is the pretender saint of Kali Yuga
 darasal rishta ye he ki ravan ke das sir the or asaram kaa bhi ek dashanan vaala rup he
 a total of ten characters, including Asaram, are associated with Asaram
 ye sab milakar banaate hai asaram kaa dashanan rup
 The saint's costume has now completely landed
 asaram kaa asli cheharaa benakaab ho gaya he
 Asaram is lodged in Jodhpur jail on charges of doing the work of Satan in disguise of a monk
 asaram ke chehre se mukhute par mukhute utar rahe hai or har mukhauta utarane ke baad dikhataa he ek alag cheharaa
 It seems that Asaram is not a face, but rather a demon
 asaram ke chehreasaram kii paap lila ke bhagidaar bhi asaram ke hi chehre ke ek rup hai
 And all these faces together make Asaram Dashanan Asaram
 sabase pehla cheharaa he khud asaram kaa
 Asaram whom the world knew as a religious saint
 duniya ne manch par unki ajab gajab lilaayen dekhi thim
 Playing Holi, singing songs, dancing
 kishan kanhaiya kaa unka rup dekha tha
 But whatever happened in Baba Asaram's hut in Jodhpur on the night of August 15, he put Asaram's terrible face in front of the world
 unke chhindwara ashram se laai gai ek naaballig ladki ne asaram par yon utpeedan kaa aarope laga diya
 Not only this, the girl also filed a report of rape and threats against Asaram at Kamla Market Police Station in New Delhi
 baba asaram par giraftaar kaa saaya mandaraane laga
 His devotees performed a lot of spectacle, but he did not do one before the law
 31 agast kii raat asaram ko police ne indore ke unke ashram se giraftaar kar liya
 What happened after Asaram went to jail, one after the other from the Papalilas, and one by one the Papalilas were exposed
 unke puraane sevakon ne hi ujagar kar diya unka asli cheharaa
 Not only this, the courage of the girls increased and several girls came out one after the other and made serious allegations against Asaram
 raipur kii ek ladki saamne ai or usne bataaya ki wo ensisi kii student thi or asaram ne uske saath chhedchhad kii thi
 Two sisters from Surat have lodged a report against Asaram and his son Narayan Sai in serious sections
 kabhi ram to kabhi krishna ke rup main bhakton ke saamne lilaayen karne vaale asaram kaa ab ravan vaala cheharaa jagajaahir hua he
 That Ravana tried to tarnish Sita, but Asaram knows how many Sita are making serious allegations
 narayan sai
 
 
 Chehraranarayan Sai, who was among the black acts of Asaram, was not just the ruler of Asaram's sage
 balki aarope he ki wo ashram kii ladakiyon kaa shoshan kiya karata tha, surat kii do bahanon main se ek ne narayan sai ke upar hi rape kaa aarope lagaaya he
 There is no need to introduce them
 naam he narayan, tamgaa lagaate hai sai kaa or inaki karatootein
 
 
 Narayan
 
 
 narayan
 
 
 If Asaram is a Nambri, then his son Narayan Sai is ten
 asaram jail main hai to narayan sai police kii giraftaar ke dar se bhaage bhaage phir rahe hai
 Narayan Sai has also been accused of rape
 a girl from Surat has also been accused of rape like her father
 darasal ye do bahane hai
 They allege that the elder sister was exploited by Asaram and the younger sister was exploited by Narayan Sai
 ye vahi narayan sai hai, jo us ladki ko maansik rup se biimaar bataa rahe the, jis ladki ne unke pita asaram ke khilaaf balaatkaar kaa cese darj karavaaya tha
 The girls of Surat have even said that Narayan Sai has raped six more girls
 inamen se teen ladkiyaan madhya pradesh or baaki teen vadodara kii hai
 When two girls from Surat appeared against Narayan Sai, the police also got into action
 narayan sai ke khilaaf luk out notice jari kar diya gaya or unki talash ke liye jagah jagah dabish di gai
 But Narayan Sai has managed to dodge the police so far
 narayan sai par ye koi pehla iljaam nahin he
 Earlier, a woman from Indore filed a case against Narayan Sai accusing him of lying and forcibly marrying her
 baap-bete karte the yon shakti vardhak dawaaon kaa sevenasaram kii hi tarah narayan sai ke bare main bhi tarah tarah ke khulaase ho rahe hai
 It has also been learned that not only Asaram Narayan Sai also used to take sexual enhancement drugs
 mor mukut dhaaran karke apni adaaen dikhaane vaale, bansuri bajaane vaale narayan sai ke khilaaf kaala jaadu or ladakiyon ke shoshan ke aarope pehle bhi lage hai
 In April 2010, an NRI accused Narayan Sai of physical abuse of his daughter-in-law
 enarai kaa kahana tha ki narayan sai ne kaala jaadu karke unki bahu kaa shoshan kiya
 The NRI had revealed the misdeeds of Narayan Sai to DK Trivedi, who is investigating the case of the death of two children in Asaram's ashram
 enarai kaa kahana tha ki narayan sai kaa jis ladki se afaire tha, usase unhone unke bete kii shaadi karvaa di
 Earlier in 2008, Asaram's death in the ashram of Ahmedabad's two children also alleged that Asaram and Narayan Sai had done black magic
 dharm kii aad main kaam ko saadhane vaale in baap beton kii kalai ab jamaane ke saamne khul gai he
 His father has already reached jail and now the danger of going to jail is also facing in front of Narayan Sai
 saamne ai beti kii karatutabeta hi nahin asaram kii beti bhi unki kaali karatuut kii pardaadaar thi
 He has also been accused of trapping girls for Asaram
 yani beti bharti thi kaliyug ke dashanan kaa teesraa cheharaa
 One of the ten heads of Asaram is his daughter Bharti
 bharti urf bharti shri ji
 Bharti Shri ji also talks like her father
 apane sureele kanth se bhajan gaakar bhakton ko bhav vibhor kar detii hai
 They are famous in the country and abroad
 lekin asaram ke cheharaa jab benakaab hua to unke puure parivaar kaa hi ek nayaa cheharaa sabake saamne aa gaya
 Bharti is also facing serious charges
 asaram or narayan sai par rape kaa aarope lagane vaali surat kii do bahanon main se choti bahan kaa aarope he ki asaram tak ladki pahunchane main uski pramukh bhoomika hoti thi
 Like her father Asaram and brother Narayan Sai, Bharati, who adorns the court of devotees, has accused the Surat girl that Bharti was also an important character of Asaram's sex racket
 wo ladakiyon ko phusalaakar asaram or narayan sai ke paas bhejti thim
 Bharti's website, shribharatishreeji
com, has earned her great glory
 ye bhi kaha gaya he ki unamem divya shaktiyaan hai, lekin ab bharti kii ibaarat ek nae dhang se likhi ja rahi he 
 The charges that have been leveled against him are very serious, he can also deliver them behind bars
 lakshmi devi bhi asaram ke gunahon main shamilvakt beetaa to baba ke kunbe ke kai chehre benakaab hue
 After all the Rajdars, his family also faced serious allegations
 aarope lage ki patni lakshmi devi bhi asaram ke gunahon main shaamil rahi he
 Lakshmi Devi calls her husband a guru
 baba vaaki guru nikle or patni ne bhi guru kaa puraa saath diya
 Two Surat-based girls who accused Asaram and Narayan Sai of rape have also made sensational accusations against Lakshmi Devi - accusations that Lakshmi Devi pressurized the girls - and also threatened not to open their mouth after rape
 donon ladakiyon ke aaropon ke baad surat police ne lakshmi devi ke khilaaf luk out notice jari kiya- taaki wo videsh naa bhaag jaaen
 Another woman who put Asaram in the dock was accused of Surat girls' accusation
 ek or cheharaa
 
 
 After Shilpi Asaram's family, Shilpi was the biggest ruler of all his crimes
 vahi shilpi jo chhindwara ashram kii varden thi
 But Kali is now in jail for his equal involvement in misdeeds
 chhindwara ashram ke gurukul kii varden shilpi ab police ke hathe chadh chuki he
 But before the arrest, he heavily seduced the police
 shilpi kaa asli naam he sanchita gupta
 She has been a warden in many of Asaram's important ashrams
 agar aaropon kii maane to shilpi hi asaram ke sex racket kii sabase badi or ahm kadi thi
 The craftsmen used to trap girls
 asaram ke bare main tamaam khulaase ho chuke hai
 It is also learned that he used to throw the light of the torch on the girl during their meeting, the girl who had this light, the serviceman understood that Baba wants to spend the night with that girl
 aaropon kii maane to baba asaram ladki chunate the or us ladki ko samajha bujhaakar, bahala phusalaakar asaram tak pahunchane kaa kaam shilpi or uske jaise sevadaar karte the
 Shilpi was the warden at Asaram's Haridwar Ashram, but Asaram once again resorted to Shilpi to call the minor girl from Chhindwara
 is khaas kaam ke liye asaram ne use chhindwara bheja tha
 Shilpi seduced the girl for several days, pretending to be a ghost, but when she did not listen, the girl persuaded the girl's parents
 jo barason se asaram ke bhakt the
 On the night of August 15, Asaram called the girl to him and Asaram is in jail because of what he did to the innocent in that slur
 asaram kii giraftaar ke baad se shilpi bhi faraar chal rahi thi
 He applied for anticipatory bail in the court, but that too was rejected
 police shilpi kii talash main chhindwara or asaram ke duusare ashramon main dabish de rahi thi
 Finally, on 25 September, Shilpi surrendered in the Jodhpur court
 sutron kii maane to shilpi ne baba asaram ke khilaaf kuch aisi sachchaaiyaan bayaan kii hai, jisase asaram kii mushkilen or bhi bad sakati hai
 Humanity is still alive in the world

 On Thursday, a Delhi Police constable and a constable filed a criminal defamation case against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for calling the Delhi Police a scam

 The answer was not found on the helpline
 Constable Ajay Kumar Taneja said, 'if words like' Thullah 'are used for the personnel of Delhi Police by popular personalities like Chief Minister, then there will be no feeling or respect for the police even in the mind of the general public, Who spends his entire life maintaining the law and order of Delhi
 ’ taneja kaa daawa he ki unhone mukhyamantri se baat karne ke liye unke karyaalay, awaas or helpline number par bhi phone kiya lekin kahin se ‘sakaaratmak pratikriya’ nahin mili
 The constable's petition filed by Laj Rao, lodging a complaint at Lajpat Nagar police station, said, "due to Kejriwal's stance towards Delhi Police mentally disturbed and intense pain, the complainant does not focus on his work Is getting, because he is very upset

 hira udyog se jude 12,600 karod rupye ke maha-ghotaale ne deshbhar ke banking sector main jahaan halchal machaa rakhi he vahiin 'india today' kii jaanch se saamne aayaa he ki kaise keemtee ratna-jawaharaat ke ek hi set ko kaagajon par dikhaakar sarkari sansthaanon se baar-baar karj lene kaa farjivada kiya jaataa rahaa
 An investigation by India Today's Special Investigation Team in Mumbai, considered the financial hub of the country, has revealed how some fraudulent diamond traders continued to defraud public sector banks by repeatedly shipping the same stock and increasing their value
 bhartiya rigerv bank(rbi) ke anumaanon ke mutabik bhartiya bainkon kii ore se ratna or jawaharaat udyog ko 11 arab dollar kaa karj diya hua he
 India Today's investigation has revealed how many traders are openly putting loans from banks in the risky real estate sector or the stock market
 desh ke bankig sector ko hilaa dene vaale pienbi ghotaale ke centre main neerav modi or mehul chokasee jaise hira kaarobaari hai, jinhone farji bank guarantee patron ko hasil kar baar- baar karj liye jabaki puraane kisi bhi karj or charge ko nahin chukaaya
 The India Today investigation uncovered many people in the diamond-gems industry who are not unaware of the methods allegedly adopted by Mama-nephew (mehul choksi-nirav Modi)
 jaanch se saamne aayaa ki jawaharaat ke ek hi stock ko baar- baar dikhaakar karj lene ke is gorakhdhandhe ko kaarobaar kii khaas jubaan main ‘pudiya ghumaao’ kaha jaataa he
 In this, the exports figures are exaggerated and coarse loans are taken
 india today ke under cover reporters ke saath mumbai main hira kaarobaari je
 Patel spoke openly
 patel ne vistaar se bataaya ki kis tarah kuch companiyaan cartal (gathjod) banaakar kaam karti hai or ek hi khep ko baar- baar dikhaakar varking capital ke naam par bainkon se karj leti rahati hai
 Patel said, 'suppose the diamond consignment was exported from here
 aapako apni kitabon main bhugtan (shipment karj) aana shuru ho jaataa he jab khep ko america, hongcong, bangkok yaa bharat se baahar kahin bhi bheja jaataa he
 The exported consignments are then smuggled back to India
 kitabon main kaarobaari yahi dikhaane main kaamyaab ho jaataa he ki videshi graahakon par uskaa paisa bakaayaa he
 In fact, a foreign-based company also has its own business
 ’patel ke mutabik bainkon se jo nae lone liye jate hai, unka istemaal phir puraane karj chukaane main kiya jaataa he
 The money that is over-invoiced (showing the increase in the price in the bill) goes smoothly into that businessman's pocket
 patel ne kaha, ‘bainkon main aise niryaat ko lekar dastavej pesh kiye jate hai or laagat se nipatane ko varking capital ke liye karj maanga jaataa he
 Banks do not know for what purpose the business is using the loan money
 kitabon main niryaat se jude tranjection dikhaakar turnover lagaataar badhata hua bataaya jaataa he
 All this happens on papers only
 bank karmchaaree or kya dekhenge? sirf kitabon main turnover hi naa
 
 
 According to the diamond trader, most of the money taken from banks in this way is invested in the black market and a hefty interest is charged on it

 Here, India Today's under-cover reporters spoke to 'jewel Creations' businessman Rajesh Anavadia as a fictitious businessman, while Rajesh did not delay in offering a deal to get a bank loan through diamonds 'twisting'

 This is a total of 200 crores
 to aapako bharat, hongcong, dubai or america se 200-200 karod kaa lone mil jayega
 That is, a loan of 800 crores will be available only at 200 crores (material value)
 ’rajesh ne company ke vailuation ko badha- chadha kar pesh karne ke liye vaise hi hatkandon kaa zikr kiya, wo sunne main vaise hi lagate hai jaise ki pienbi maamle main neerav modi or mehul chokasee ne kathith taur par istemaal kiye

 com / 7buaagz6ng— Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian)december 1, 2015 4 years of Narendra Modi government have been completed
 is dauraan tamaam sudhaarwadi kadamon, siyaasi prayogon or brands modi kii chunavi uplabdhiyon ke saath-saath sarkaar ko lagaataar virodh kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa he
 The special thing is that there were constant voices from inside the BJP against the opposition as well as the Modi government
 2014 ke aam chunaav se lekar tripura-gujarat ke chunaavon tak jahamodi-shah brandaka jalawaa rahaa vahiin party ke andar se virodh main awaajen bhi buland hoti raheen
 Many leaders who have raised their voice against Modi from within the BJP are very old leaders of the party who have been accusing them even of occupying the organization
 yahaan aise hi paanch netaaon ke bare main baat kii ja rahi he
 Shatrughan Sinha has remained the biggest critic of Modi, BJP MP from Bihar and former actor Shatrughan Sinha, since forming the Modi government in 2014 and not finding a place in Team Modi
 ve modi ke har faisle, har kadam kaa apane bayanon se yaa soshal media ke jariye khulkar virodh karte hai
 Shatrughan Sinha directly blamed PM Modi for the PNB scam and said that PM Modi should now come in front of the country and hold press conferences and answer questions
 pichley maheene phir shotgan ke naam se mashhoor bijepi netaa ne sanvaidhanik sansthaaon ko kamjor karne ke aarope lagaae or sidhaa morcha kholte hue kaha- pradhanmantri modi chaahe jitne kapade badalakar or videsh yatra karke vaahvahee luuten, lekin desh main jo bhi halaat bighad rahe hai uske liye unhen hi gaali milegi, kyonki tali agar captain ko to gaali bhi captain ko
 Despite constant criticism, Shatrughan Sinha continued to remain in the BJP, while also supporting the opposition RJD leader Lalu Yadav and his son Tejashwi
 kejariwal samet tamaam modi virdohi netaaon se milte rahe
 But on the question of leaving the party, Shotgun said that BJP is his first and last party
 yashavanth sinhabijepi ke varisht netaa or atal sarkaar main vitt mantri rahe yashavanth sinha 2014 main chunavi raajnneeti se alag ho gaye the
 He was replaced by his son Jayant Sinha from Hazaribagh, who is still a minister in the Modi government
 lekin yashavanth sinha lagaataar modi ke khilaaf morcha khole rahe
 Last month, Yashwant Sinha announced his break-up with the BJP and formed the Rashtra Manch with several opposition leaders
 sinha ne elaan kiya ki modi sarkaar kii galat nitiyon se desh ko bachaayenge
 In the same week, Yashwant Sinha attacked PM Modi and BJP President Amit Shah, saying that today's BJP has become a party of only two people
 yashavanth ne kaha ki jetali ne 4 saal main desh kii arthvyavastha ko gart main laa diya
 Last year, Yashwant Sinha wrote a detailed article about the economy and said- "what is the condition of the economy today?" Private investment is falling
 industrial production sikud rahaa he
 Agriculture is in crisis, construction and other service sectors are slowing down, exports are in trouble, demonetisation has failed and GST implemented in the past has drowned many, snatched employment
 nae maukey nahin dikh rahe
 Shanta Kumar, senior BJP leader and leader of the guide board, Shanta Kumar, launched an indirect attack against the Modi government in February this year
 unhone kaha ki mohammad gauri, gazani or angrejon ne bharat ko lutaa tha, lekin ab apane hi log lut rahe hai
 The looters are also their own and the government which gives the loot is also their own
 unhone kaha ki karodon-arabon rupaya kuch bade udyogpatiyon ko udhaar dekar lutaaya ja rahaa he
 There is no action against such influencers
 jabaki garib kisaan udhaar letaa he or uski fasal barbaad hoti he to bhi us par sakht karrwai hoti he
 The result of limited action to poor farmers alone is that more than three lakh farmers have committed suicide
 savitri bai phuleupi ke baharich se bijepi saansad savitri bai phule apni hi party ke liye nai chunauti hai
 Savitri Bai Phule, coming from the Dalit community, opened a front against her own party and the Modi government over changes in the SC / ST Act
 phule ne pichley maheene apni hi sarkaar ke khilaaf andolan shuru kiya or lakhanu main‘samvidhan va aarakshan bachaao mahareli’kaa aayojan kiya
 During this, he said that reservation is not a begging but a matter of representation
 agar aarakshan ko khatm karne kaa dussahas kiya gaya to bharat kii dharti par khun kii nadiyaan bahengi
 Savitri Bai Phule said- Constitution and reservation are in danger
 main saansad rahun yaa na rahun lekin samvidhan ke saath chhedchhad nahin hone duungi
 The attack against the Dalits and the Modi government surrounded by changes in the SC / ST Act took place from inside the house and was quite uncomfortable
 kirti azadbijapi ke tejatarraar saansad or purv cricketer kirti aaazaad ne 2015 main dilli jila cricket sangh-didisie main bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaate hue vitt mantri arun jetali ke khilaaf morcha kholaa
 He was then suspended from the BJP
 unhone piem modi se sawaal poocha ki kya bhrashtachar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaanaa unki galati thi?notebandi ke faisle ke khilaaf bhi kirti aaazaad ne aawaaj buland kii or kaha ki bina taiyaari ke kiye gaye faisle ke kaaran logon ko kaaphi pareshaani hui
 He said - Many people including farmers, laborers, employees, small traders, jewelers have been badly affected by the note ban, even vegetable vendors are not getting the right price
 pichley hafte kirti aaazaad lalu prasad yadav ke betetejasvi yadavase mili or tejasvi kii tarif karte hue unhen bihar kii raajnneeti kaa ‘vander boy’ kaha

 Often people suspect that there is no adulteration in the food they are using
 But the common man does not have any method by which he can find out or strictly check adulteration
 lekin ab aapaki yah dikkat dur hone vaali he
 At the behest of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, FSSAI has prepared a kit that will allow you to check whether the food is adulterated or not
 khaas baat yah he ki is jaanch karne vaali kit kii keemat bhi behad kam sirf 10 yaa 20 rupee hogi
 FSSAI has prepared the way to make this kit and now talks are on with companies who can make and launch this kit in the market
 shuruyaat main is kit se doodh, khaane ke tel main milawat kaa pataa kiya ja sakegaa
 In the meeting of the Central Consumer Protection Council in Delhi, it was discussed that there are a lot of complaints of adulteration in the edible oil from place to place and what can be done to deal with it
 yah baat ubharkar saamne ai ki kanoonee taur par khaane kaa tel khulaa bechney par roak he, iske baavjood dhadlle se chote shaharon or gaanvon main khaane kaa tel khulaa bechaa jaataa he jisase milawat hone kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 The ministry will now contact companies that make edible oil and ask them to bring edible oil in small packs in the market so that the business of selling open oil ends
 prayog ke taur par mantralay ne ek company se kaha he ki vah pashchim bengal main doodh or pani ke wedding mashin kii tarah khaane ke tel kii vending mashin lagaae
 If this experiment is successful, it will be tried elsewhere
 garmiyaan shuru hote hi doodh main milawat kii shikaayat bhi kaaphi bad jaati he
 Recently, the FSSAI conducted a test by taking samples from about two and a half thousand places across the country, then some surprising things came to light
 pataa chalaa ki uttar bharat ke rajyon main doodh main milawat kii shikaayat zyada he, jabaki dakshin bharat ke rajyon main yah shikaayat kam he
 The FSSAI is going to launch another campaign to check adulteration of milk in the summer in which milk samples will be collected from all over the country

 The top court has withdrawn the moratorium on arrest and interrogation of Rajiv Kumar in the Saradha chit fund scam case
 supreme court ne unako agrim jamaanat ke liye hoicourt kaa rukh karne ke liye 7 din kaa samay bhi diya he
 The apex court said that if Rajiv Kumar does not approach the Calcutta High Court within seven days and he does not get anticipatory bail from there, the CBI can arrest Rajiv Kumar after seven days
 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle sibiai ke adhikari jab rajeev kumaar se poochtacha karne pahunche the, to kolkata police ne unako hiraasat main le liya tha
 After this Rajiv Kumar moved the Supreme Court for relief from the arrest of the CBI and his arrest was stayed
 is maamle main sibiai ne abhi tak rajeev kumaar ke khilaaf exiaar bhi darj nahin kiya he
 Now after the order of the Supreme Court, the CBI will issue notice to Rajiv Kumar and call for questioning
 rajeev kumaar ko hiraasat main lekar poochtacha karne ke liye sibiai ko maamle main exiaar darj kerani hogi
 On the other hand, the legal team of Rajiv Kumar has decided to go to the Calcutta High Court for anticipatory bail in the case
 rajeev kumaar kii legal team kaa kahana he ki agar sibiai ne unke khilaaf exiaar darj kii, to usko radd karaane ke liye bhi adaalat main yachika daayar kii jaaegi
 The legal team of Rajiv Kumar will also approach the Election Commission to initiate the legal process for anticipatory bail
 saath hi chunaav ayog se rajeev kumaar ko kolkata jane kii ijaajat dene kii apil karegi
 Rajiv Kumar may once again approach the Supreme Court to escape the Calcutta High Court lawyer's arrest
 isaki vajah yah he ki pichley teen din se kalakatta hoicourt ke vakil hadtaal kar rahe hai
 No lawyer is appearing in the High Court hearing
 aise main rajeev kumaar apni agrim jamaanat ke liye phir se supreme court ja sakate hai
 What is the whole matter, who is Rajiv Kumar? Actually, Rajiv Kumar's name has come up in the Saradha chit fund scam case
 isko lekar sibiai rajeev kumaar se poochtacha karnaa chaahati he
 In this connection, the CBI also tried to raid the whereabouts of Rajiv Kumar
 haalanki kolkata police ne sibiai ke adhikariyon ko hi hiraasat main le liya tha, lekin baad main chhod diya tha
 Former Kolkata Police Commissioner and former CID ADG Rajeev Kumar is the one with whom recently West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee sat on a dharna against the central government
 kuch din pehle rajeev kumaar ke ghar par sibiai ne chapa maaraa tha
 Against this, Mamata Banerjee had spoken out against the Modi government and sat on a dharna
 iske baad yah maamla supreme court pahunch gaya tha
 After the order of the apex court, the matter was calmed down a bit and Rajiv Kumar was removed from the post of Commissioner
 iske baad unki niyukti siaidi main kii gai thi
 After this, the Election Commission removed Rajiv Kumar from the post of ADG of CID and sent him back to the Ministry of Home Affairs

 The winter session of Parliament, which began on 5 December, was scheduled to last until 20 December, but concluded on Wednesday
 shuruuaat se hi hangaame ke kaaran donon sadanon main ek bhi din prashnkaal nahin chal paaya
 Talking of achievements, Parliament passed only one important bill 'lokpal and Lokayukta Bill' with amendments under legislative work
 is bich, sansadeey kaary mantri kamalnath ne sanket diya ki aam chunaav se pehle nae saal main bajet satr kii bajaay lekha anudaan paarit karaane ke liye loksabhaa or rajyasabha kii baithken alpakaalik notice par phir bulaai ja sakati hai
 Kamal Nath said that the winter session has not been pruned and has only been postponed indefinitely
 alpakaalik notice par baithak phir bulaai ja sakati he

 team anna kii pramukh sadsy kiran bedi ko lekar chal rahe aalochanaon ke daur kaa jawaab dete hue gandhivadi anna hajaare ne kaha ki agar kiran ne kuch bhi galat kiya he to uski jaanch kara lee jaae
 He said that the gang of four people involved in the government is involved in the campaign against his team
 unhone kaha ki aarope or apmaan hi kuch ke liye mantra he
 The leader of the anti-corruption campaign said that they fear losing power with the arrival of Jan Lokpal
 apni team ke sadasyon par vittiya gadabadiyon ke aaropon ke baad hajaare ne apane vichaar apane nae blog main vyakt kiye
 The name of the blog is, get up and fight against the gang of four
 haalanki gandhivadi kaaryakarta ne chaar vyaktiyon kaa naam jaahir nahin kiya lekin unka ishaara sanyukt samiti ke kuch sadasyon kii ore tha
 Hazare said, accusing and insulting seems to be the mantra of some people
 aisa pehali baar nahin he ki kiran bedi ke khilaaf aarope lagaaya gaya he
 Every member of Team Anna has faced allegations and character abuses from the gang of these four people
 unhone kaha, ye log koun hai? ye vahi log hai jo jan lokapal vidheyak ke paksh main nahin hai
 Meanwhile, Kiran Bedi claimed that Anna told her that the work should not be affected by the allegations
 kaaryakarta ne kriyasheel award grahan karne ke baad kaha, hajaare ne mujhe yahaan tak kaha ki jo aarope aapke khilaaf lage hai, ve aarope pichley 20 varsh se mujhe prabhavit kar rahe hai
 Do not let these things affect your work
 unki tippanee in aaropon ke baad ai he ki vah apane aayojakon se yatra kaa bill zyada vasuulati hai, jabaki un yatraaon ke liye vah apane veerta padak kaa istemaal kar riyayati dar par hawaii tikat kharidti hai
 She defended herself by saying that she herself does not benefit from it and thus the money saved goes to her NGO

 NASA released amazing photos of Supernova
 
 
 mehnat or mazdooree ke dam par rickshaw chalaane vaale harikishan pippal ne safalataa kii anuthi misaal banaai he
 In fact, today the owner of crores, Harikishan Pippal, was born into a poor and Dalit family
 pita kii juuta marammat karne kii dukaan thi
 But home expenses could not be managed with this
 yahaan tak ki do vakt kii roti naseeb ho jaae, ye badi baat thi
 Seeing the situation in his home, Harikishan Pippal started working as a laborer
 lekin padhai nahin chodi
 Worked during the day and studied diligently at night
 duniya ke pehle super doorabeen se khulegaa brahmad kaa rajlekin harikishan jaise hi 10veen main pahunche unke pita kii tabiyat kharaab ho gai
 The situation in the house became worse
 ghar kaa kharch or pita kii dawaaon kaa boj bad gaya
 In such a situation, without telling the family, Harikshan asked for a bicycle rickshaw from a relative and started driving
 koi pahchaan na le, isliye chehre par kapadaa baandh lete
 Then one day Harikishan got a salary of Rs 80 salary in a factory
 unki patni kii salaah par harikishan ne kuch samay baad bank se 15 hajaar rupee karj lekar apni puraani dukaan ko hi dobaaraa shuru kar diya
 However, due to a family dispute, Harikishan and his family had to leave the house
 lekin unhone apane sapane kaa daaman nahin choda
 Then one day the turning point came in Harikishan's life and he got an order to make 10 thousand pairs of shoes from the State Trading Corporation
 iske baad harikishan ne peeche palatakar kabhi nahin dekha
 Harikshan then started getting orders from Bata as well and in the meantime he launched a company called People Exports Private Limited, in which he started designing shoes for the international brand
 harikishan yaheen nahin ruke
 He opened the restaurant and also built the Shadar wedding hall
 healthcare sector main unhone saal 2001 main heritage pipuls hospital kii sthapana kii
 Apart from this, he also entered the vehicle dealership and publication firm
 apni mehnat or doordarshita ke aadhaar par harikishan ne kamyaabi kaa paracham laharaaya
 Their company turnover is more than 100 crores

 unhone kaha ki aisa hone se hi is tabake kaa vikaas ho sakegaa
 Paswan said, "we want a law to be made through which backward castes get reservation in jobs in the private sector
" ham dekh rahe hai ki aazaadee ke itane saalon baad bhi desh main daliton kii sthiti kitni dayaneey he
 Paswan, who leads Dalit politics, told reporters, "the private sector is also making a profit from the government
 unhen bhi daliton ke liye aarakshan kii vyavastha kerani chahie

 bijepi kii chunaav prachaar samiti ke mukhiya or gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi mangalvaar ko dilli pahunche
 The alleged reason is the meeting with the Planning Commission
 magar nigahen rajnatik paton par zyada tiki hai kyonki ye chunavi mukut dhaaran karne ke baad modi kii pehali dilli yatra he
 Modi will use it to interact with elderly leaders like Advani and Joshi and also to give a message to the cadre
 kya hai in sabake myne
 
 
 In the morning, Modi reached Murali Manohar Joshi, the elder of the party, No
2
 joshi un kuch netaaon main bataae ja rahe the, jo adwani gut ke to nahin hai, lekin modi udai se sahaj bhi nahin hai
 When there was a time in Goa that instead of signs, it should be straightforward and Narendra Modi be declared the PM candidate, Joshi was one of the few people who vetoed it once
 goa main hui raily se bhi vah nadaarad the
 The truth is that Joshi has been struggling vigorously to maintain his political importance since the 2004 Vajpayee government
 loksabhaa chunaav haarane ke baad unka jor apane liye surakshit seat talashne par hi rahaa
 The search resulted in 2009, when Joshi contested elections from Benares instead of Allahabad and was successful in reaching the Lok Sabha
 iske baad bhi unka punarvaas nahin ho paaya
 The faction of his group failed in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections
 sansad main bhi mahatvapurn masalon par bahes main vah lead karte najar nahin aae
 Joshi was supported during this time only by the Sangh
 jab vah maanav sansaadhan mantri the, to paathyakram main badlaav, jyotish kii padhai jaise kai kadamon ke jariye vah sangh ke chahete ban gaye the
 Critics called it the saffronisation of education, but Joshi remained careless then
 lekin ab unhen parvaah kerani he
 They have to see that when the second generation of the party has taken over the leadership, then what, how much and where is left for them
 modi joshi ke ghar gaye or ek ghante tak baatcheet hui
 After that Joshi came in front of journalists and said, 'modi ji had come
 unhone kaha ki aap sab logon ne mujhe ye jimmedaari di he, main use acchhee tarah se sabko saath lekar nibhaane kii koshish kar rahaa hum
 During this time, Joshi did not have the enthusiasm in his face and gesture, which BJP workers have become accustomed to see in the context of Modi
 joshi kii ek chintaa yah bhi he ki modi upi kii jin siton se loksabhaa chunaav lard sakate hai, unamem se ek seat banaras kii bhi bataai ja rahi he
 So where will he contest from? haalanki is sikke kaa doosraa pahalu bhi he
 Narendra Modi must definitely have people in his team who are experienced, have seen the colors of central power
 joshi ke rup main unke paas ek trump card ho saktaa he
 This message can be given through them, see that the elders are still respected
 ye daanv surakshit hoga kyonki joshi kabhi bhi modi ke liye khatra nahin ban sakate
 When the danger came, Advani remembered again
 hameshaa aaenge, jab bhi bijepi kaa, yaa is desh kaa rajnatik itihaas likhaa jayega
 Whenever there will be mention of Modi's PM claim and after this, Pitamah to sit in Kop Bhawan
 baharhaal, modi ne is naaraazgi ko kitni tavajjo di thi, ye un do dinon main sabit ho gaya
 Modi was busy in Gujarat when the entire party organization was clearly in front of Advani
 unhone adwani ko sirf do sandesh die
 Through both tweets
 pehla, desh ke lakhon kaaryakarta chaahate hai ki aap istipha waapas len
 And then two days later another that you did not disappoint us
 magar rajnath ke israar par bhi modi manaane dilli nahin aae the
 Have come now, have come to meet Advani
 magar yah sab sirf rajnatik shishtachar hi he
 Modi Brigade has repeatedly made it clear that the party now only needs the guidance and blessings of Advani
 netritv karne kii na sochen vah
 In fact, Advani has chosen for himself the glory of political seclusion
 pehle vah jediu ke sahare dabaav banaate rahe
 Now that Nitish has shaken his head, the eyes are also on the elderly side
 in sabake bich modi unke ghar ja to rahe hai, lekin yah bhi saaf he ki kuch hi dinon main yah mulaakaaten rasmi ho jaaenge
 BJP leaders still visit Atal Bihari Vajpayee's house
 unase aashirwad lete hai
 But Vajpayee is not publicly seen
 adwani najar aate hai, magar party nahin chaahati ki ve iskaa istemaal sanghathan par hi nishaanaa saadhane main karen
 That is why he forgot the resignation in the shield of the phone of the Sangh chief
 magar sangh baar baar unhen yaad dilaataa rahegaa ki ab moh chhodie
 It is also natural because at present, the fascination of the Sangh is for Modi only and only
 modi kii dilli yatra kaa ek or padaav jhandevalaan kaa sangh daftar bhi saktaa he
 The issue is of change here too
 sangh ke party main pratinidhi suresh soni ko lekar kai sawaal uthe hai
 And these questions are not arising from now on
 rajnath ke pehle kaarykaal ke dauraan hi soni kii sakriyata rashtriya ho gai thi
 In such a situation, it is believed that Mohan Bhagwat will also change here
 gairrajanatik ruchi or chhavi vaale dattatreya hosbale jaise sangh padaadhikari ko sanghathan main bheja ja saktaa he
 Modi's interest will be more than saving Sony, forging a friendship with a new contender
 doston kii modi ko vaise bhi is vakt sakht jarurat he
 Their mother organization Sangha repeats, Sanghe Shakti Kalyugay
 or is kalyug main desh kii satta saajhedaaron ke liye jariye hi milti he
 The partners, who today because of them, are sticking sticks on the streets of Patna
 magar is aaj ke baad ek kal bhi aayega
 The results of whose 2014 Lok Sabha elections are held, and the people who decide them are in the mood
 modi hon yaa koi or, sabko bas us mizaaj kii chintaa kerani he
 With or without elders
 kyonki ye janata har paanch saal main jawan hoti he auki loktantr par apana majboot thappa jadti he

 karnataka main congress kaa cheharaa rahul gandhi nahin, balki mukhyamantri siddharmaiya he
 This is the reason that the party's victory in the state rests on them
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad congress pehali baar bijepi ko sidhe taur par kadi takkar detii hui najar aa rahi he
 Siddaramaiah has been successful in becoming the biggest face of the Congress due to its functioning and development model of the last five years
 isiilie party ne unhen karnataka main swatantra tareeke se kaam karne kii chhot de rakhi thi
 In the counting of votes, Siddaramaiah is leading ahead of Badami while trailing Chamundeshwari
 bekhauf or belaag andaaj vaale siddharmaiya ke saharecongress karnatakamein satta ko barkaraar rakhane kii koshish main lagi he
 If Congress wins the election, the credit will go to them and even if it loses, the fair will blow their heads
 yahi vajah he ki karnataka main ve kisi tarah kii koi kor-kasar nahin chhod rahe hai
 This time he is contesting from two assembly seats
 ve chamundeshwari or badami vidhansabha seat se pratyaashee hai
 Siddaramaiah was born on August 12, 1948, in a poor peasant family in the village of Siddaramanhundi in the political district of Safarmasur
 unhone mysore vishvavidhyalay se snaatak kiya
 From here he also obtained a degree of advocacy and also practiced for some time
 dow
 Siddaramaiah, influenced by the socialist ideas of Ram Manohar Lohia and a member of the 'janata Parivar', had left politics in the practice of advocacy
 unhone saal 1983 main pehali baar lokdal ke tikat par chamundeshwari vidhansabha seat se jeet darj kii or baad main janata party main shaamil ho gaye
 He was the first chairman of the Monitoring Committee 'kannada Kavalu Committee' formed during the tenure of Ram Krishna Hegde as Chief Minister to monitor the use of Kannada as the official language of the state
 do saal baad hue madhyavadhi chunaav main unhone dobaaraa jeet hasil kii or hegade kii sarkaar main pashupaalan evam pashu chikitsa mantri bane
 Siddaramaiah organized the conference 'ahinda' (kannada word defining minorities, backward and Dalits) thrice to establish himself as the leader of Dalits
 haalanki saal 2005 main devgauda ne putrmoh main aakar siddharmaiya ko party se baahar kar diya tha
 This step of JDS became a problem for the politics of Deve Gowda
 congress ke saath rishtiske baad saal 2006 main siddharmaiya apane samarthakon ke saath congress se jud gaye
 In December 2007, he again won the Chamundeshwari by-election in Mysore
 varsh 2008 main hue chunaav main vah congress kii prachaar samiti ke adhyaksh bane
 He then contested from Varuna Assembly seat and became an MLA
 siddharmaiya 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main party ke diggaj netaa ke taur par apane aapako sthapit karne main safal rahe
 In 2013, the Congress returned under his leadership
 siddharmaiya party vidhayakon par bahut acchhee pakad ke chalate varisht congress netaa or loksabhaa main congress netaa mallikarjun khadge ko pachhad siem bane the

 This was a conspiracy for the secular syndicate and such conspiracies will clear this syndicate in the coming elections because the public knows the truth of all this
 nakvi ne daawa kiya ki congress netritv vaali sarkaar kii ulti ginati shuru ho gayi he or bijepi aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main kareeb 300 siten jitkar apane dam par narendra modi ke netritv main sarkaar banaaegi
 The more attacks that the parties like Congress, SP, BSP together will make on the BJP, the stronger it will emerge
 kanpur main 19 oktober ko modi kii hone vaali pehali raily kii taiyaariyon kii samiksha karne bijepi upaadhyaksh nakvi kanpur aae the
 Regarding the news of meeting of the Uttar Pradesh government for the construction of Ram temple, he said that all this is the electoral stratum of Congress, SP and BSP, which acts as a 'secular syndicate'
 nakvi ne congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki rahul gandhi ghotaalon ke ghantaghar par khadey hokar apni party kii naakaamiyon kaa nagaada baja rahe hai
 He is the crown prince of a government that has nothing to offer in the name of achievements
 isliye aane vaale chunaavon main congress kaa desh se supada saaf ho jayega kyonki uski ulti ginati ab shuru ho gai he
 He said that till the election, all these (SP, BSP) live together and plunder the public's money but once the elections start, they again split up for appearances and start fighting with each other
 
 tisare morche ke gathan ke sawaal par nakvi ne kaha ki teesraa morcha ek ‘expred chunavi chocolate’ he or iskaa shigupha har chunaav ke pehle choda jaataa he, lekin yah ummiden hameshaa naakaamayaab rahati hai or is baar bhi naakaamayaab rahengi
 Naqvi said that Modi will conduct a conclave against the Uttar Pradesh government and Congress from Kanpur on 19 October
 unhone daawa kiya ki congress ke kushasan se pareshaan hokar janata bijepi ko aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon main spasht janadesh degi or kareeb 300 loksabhaa siten jeet kar bhaajapa desh main narendra modi ke netritv main agali sarkaar banaaegi
 The Congress and its secular syndicate will have to face defeat in these elections
 isse pehle unhone bijepi ke jiladhyaksh surendra maithani ke saath modi ke raily sthal par taiyaariyon ko dekha or baariki se janaa
 Later Naqvi also held a meeting with BJP workers

 In fact, Yadav community has the largest number of OBC community in Uttar Pradesh

 Yadav voters have played an important role in the political rise of Mulayam Singh Yadav in the state
 pichley teen dashak se yadav samaaj sapa ke saath majbootee ke saath judaa rahaa he
 The slogan of Mayawati's all-round hitay-sarjan Sukhaya and Narendra Modi's Sabka saath-sabka Vikas has not been able to separate the Yadav community from the SP

 He has stepped up the exercise to form national and state executive
 akhilesh yadav ke haath main sapa kii kaman aane se ruthe netaaon ko shivpal apane saath jodne main jute hai

 shivpal yadav jald hi phulpur se saansad rahe atik ahamed se mulaakaat karenge
 It is believed that they can also join the secular front
 samaajawaadee secular morcha sapa se baagi netaaon kaa thikaana banataa dikh rahaa he
 Shivpal is constantly saying that this front has been made only for the leaders who are angry with the SP

 Rejecting the practice of parallel trials in the media, he said that as far as some lower courts are concerned, they are pressurized into larger cases where the media somehow declares a person guilty or innocent

 If the government interferes with the task of controlling the media, there may be some difficulties

 According to the minister, intelligence agencies had claimed that their media coverage during the 26 / 11 terror attacks in Mumbai helped the attackers' bosses and kept them informed about what the security agencies were doing

 Regarding the possibility of censorship, Jaitley said that technology has made it impossible

 com / bexnlcq3eb a Pakistani journalist spread propaganda against Indian security forces in Jammu and Kashmir and tried unsuccessfully to divide them
 iske baad siarpief ne pakistani patrkaar ke twit par riplai karte hue use niraadhaar or jhooth qaraar diya
 In fact, a Pakistani journalist tweeted and wrote that a rift has arisen between the Indian security forces deployed in Kashmir
 saath hi usne likhaa ki ek garbhvatee mahila ko suraksha balon ne karfu paas nahin hone ke kaaran aspataal tak nahin jane diya, jiske baad ek muslim kashmiri pulicekarmi ne 5 siarpief ke javaanon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya
 After this CRPF called it false and said that the color of our uniform may be different but the heart is the same
 iske jawaab main siarpief ne kaha ki hameshaa kii tarah hindustan ke suraksha bal or sena ekajute hokar or sauhardra ke saath kaam kar rahe hai
 The color of our uniform may be different but patriotism and tricolor are completely filled in our hearts
 ek taraf pakistani patrkaar or media santhaan hindustan ke khilaaf anargal baaten failaa rahe hai to duusari ore baukhalaahat main pakistan ne apane desh ke channelon ko adhisuchana jari kar kaha he ki aisa koi program na chalaaen jisase kashmiri ke logon kii bhavanaaen aahat hon
 The Pakistani Media Regulatory Authority has asked media institutions not to broadcast live pre-recorded programs or special programs on eid-ul-azha, as it "may hurt not only our nation, but also the sentiments of Kashmiri brothers" is
 "niamak praadhikaran ne shanivaar ko jari ek adhisuchana main kaha, "kashmir ke saath ekajutata jataane ke liye, id-ul-ajaha ko dharmik parv ke rup main saadagi ke saath manaaya ja rahaa he
 Therefore, it is requested that there are no special events (previously recorded or planned live)

 " kendriyagrih mantrirajnath singh ne kaha ki unhenkbarko mahaan kehane main koi aapatti nahin he lekin yah baat unki samaj se pare he ki maharana pratap komahanakehane main kya aapatti ho sakati he
 While unveiling a statue of Maharana Pratap in Pratapgarh, Rajasthan, the Home Minister said that history should be corrected
 CBSE ke course main karaayenge maharana kii gaatha shamilrajnath singh ne maharana pratap ko mahaan bataate hue kaha ki vah maanav sansaadhan mantri se maharana pratap kii gaatha ko sibiesai kepaathyakramame shaamil karne ke liye aagrah karenge
 He said, i believe that Maharana Pratap was also great and when the discussion of Maharana Pratap is done, one immediately remembers the land of Mewar
 maharna pratap kii jeevani ko vistaar main padhaane ke sambandh main rajasthan sarkaar ke faisle kaa swaagat karte hue rajnath singh ne kaha ki bharat sarkaar bhi maharana pratap kii gaatha ko keval bharat main nahin puure vishwa main pahunchane kaa prayaas karegi
 According to Home Minister, the 475th birth anniversary of Maharana Pratap will be celebrated throughout India and Indians living in other countries of the world will also celebrate the birth anniversary of Maharana Pratap, according to Home Minister
 rajnath singh ne kaha ki maharana pratap ek aisi shakhsiyat the jinhone mathrubhumi kii raksha ke liye apana sab kuch nyochhavar kar diya
 But in the history of India, the way Maharana Pratap was supposed to be evaluated, it could not be evaluated correctly
 unhone kaha ki maharana pratap desh main nahi videsh main bhi prerana ke strot rahen he

 actress priyanka chopra in dinon film 'dil dhadkane do' ke pramotion ke saath-saath bajirao mastaani kii shooting main bhi vyast hai
 Priyanka is playing an important character in Dil Dhadakne Do
 joya akhtar ke nirdesan main bani yah multistarar film 5 june ko relies hone ja rahi he
 Excerpts from a special conversation i had with Priyanka Chopra about this film: What was the reason for doing the multi-starrer film 'dil Dhadakne Do'? i think it was a great script
 har insaan is kahani se khud ko jod kar dekh saktaa he
 We have heard in our families at some time that if you do this, what will the society say
 to ye kahani manoranjan ke saath waisi hi he
 Is it even in your family that 'what will people say'? When i was 17 years old, my mother sent my photo to India without telling anyone
 papa ko bhi nahin bataaya tha or jab jeet gai to puure parivaar vaale chachaa, bade papa, sabaki baaten bhi sunne ko mili to aisa hamaari family main bhi hota he kii 'log kya kahenge'
 Whom does your heart beat for? My heart beats in every relationship, whether the film has Rahul Bose (husband) Farhan Akhtar (my friend) Ranveer Singh (brother) or my dad (anil Kapoor)
 ye 10 din kii jo kahani he film kii usamen bahut saare rishton ke mudde khadey hote hai
 So my heart beats for all this
 kya film main anil kapur tipical fadar hai jo apane usulon or niyamon par chalate hai?ji bilkul, vaisaa hi kirdaar unhone play kiya he jinka meri maa (shefali shah) ke saath bhi rishta bas upar-upar kaa he or sabase bada mudda he 'socity kya kahegi'
 In the film, everyone is seen trying to get you to speak, but how much rebel are you in real life? i am not an unnecessary rebel, i always go against the flow, if something seems right then try to go in that direction only i do this and have encouraged the people of my house to do what they think is right and if something goes wrong, accept it
 main hameshaa apni galati maanati hum
 You yourself are from small town and today you are very big, do you see any change in small town girls these days? See i was very lucky because my parents supported me a lot
 hamaare sapane kitne bhi bade ho lekin family saath naa de to wo bikhar hi jate hai
 The rest of my family never supported me
 mere chachaa ne to yahaan tak bol diya tha ki agar actor banegi to ghar mat aane dena
 My dad always supported me
 unhone kaha actress banogi lekin padhai kaise hogi? maine kaha kii main 18 saal kii hum or apana 1 saal film ko dena chaahuungi phir mere dead ne kaha kii thik he tum dedh saal lo, agar hua to thik nahin to padhai
 It is very important to have family support in this way
 aapke liye feminism kya he?dekhiye jab main industry main ai thi to producers kaa khyaal tha ki agar dats kii problem he to ladkiyaan badali ja sakati hai, jab maine fishan kii thi to mujhase kaha gaya tha ki kariyar main jab filmein naa mili to mahila pradhan filmein kerani chahie, mujhe hameshaa se bura lagata tha kii kya main talented nahin hum? artist nahin hum? jab 2 ladkiyaan ek saath film main kaam karti hai to kaha jaataa he cat- fite karengi, aisa ladakon ke liye nahin he, aakhir hamen kam kyon samajha jaataa he? to mere liye hameshaa hi ye ladaai rahi he jiske kaaran maine 'barphy', 'saat khun maaf' yaa 'mairi com' jaisi filmein kii hai jisase kii hamaare producers ko paisa mili or wo zyada filmein bana saken
 You don't promote fairness cream anymore? Yes i did such an ad for a year long ago but then stopped doing it because i am not myself and that thing is different that people consider me photogenic
 anil kapur is film main aapke pita bane hai, kabhi man nahin kiya kisi film main unke saath romance karne kaa?aapako nahin pataa hoga kii maine apana pehla shot ek hero ke taur par anil sar (anil kapur) ke saath hi diya tha wo satish kowshik kii film thi jo ki nahin ban pai
 We shot a scene but did not get a chance after that
 vaise meraa maananaa he ki ek actor ke liye acting karnaa jaruri he
 Doesn't matter what the relationship is playing
 abhi ranvir ke saath maine gunde main romance kiya to 'dil dhadkane do' main unki bahan ke role main hum
 Apart from this, in the upcoming film 'bajirao Mastani', he will play his wife's role, toking is necessary
 aap apane gane ke tallent ko dabaa ke kyon rakhti hai?(hansate hue) mujhe vakt nahin mil paata
 Although i have sung a title song in 'mary Kom' to do Riyaz and in Farhan's voice in 'dil Dhadakne Do', but to tell the truth, i just don't like to sing, singing with Riyaz is necessary and whenever there is a chance Will get full Riyaz and sing

 In the last two years, university campuses have emerged as centers of political pulse in the country
 nichle hisse dakshin main hyderabad vishvavidhyalay ke campus main rohit vemula kii khudakushi se campason main faile jati or dharm ke vish kii lakeeren saamne aa gayi
 On the other hand, Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi became an arena for the fight of two opposing ideologies

 When a visionary vice-chancellor was trying to change the course and course of the course, the central government stopped him in between

 No one has been able to challenge this status for the last four years

 Focus on the extension of education This year three new categories were introduced in this study - Medical, Technology and Legal
 iskaa makasad kala, vigyaan or vaanijya kii teen mukchay dhaaraon main corson ko padhaane vaale vishvavidhyalayon se vishay or kshetra vishesh ke vishvavidhyalayon ko alag karnaa tha
 a change has also been made in the manner of survey
 is saal sabhi vishvavidhyalayon ke ek hi samay ke vaastavik data hasil nahin hone kii vajah se hamane keval dharnatmak data par vichaar kiya he
 This is because of the change in the dominance of government universities
 It is also clear that despite the huge increase of privately owned universities, why do government universities dominate in every category? Even many experts attribute the expansion of the higher education sector in the last two decades to the contribution of the private sector
 desh main vishvavidhyalayon kii sankhya 1950 main 20 se badhkar 2015 main 757 ho gai
 Out of these 267 universities are in private hands
 ucch shiksha main sakal namakan anupaat main 2001-02 or 2013-14 ke bich baari oochaal ai he or yah 8
 1 per cent to 23
 6 fisadi ho gaya he
 The reason behind this boom is also the rise of the private sector, which has more than 60 percent share in enrollments in higher education
 tis par bhi aam dharna yahi bani hui ki nijee kshetra menshiksha kii gunvatttrab bhi vivaad kaa vishay he
 Enrollment increases but compromises on quality, says Sachchidanand Sinha, professor at the Center for Regional Development Studies at JNU, "the enrollment growth has certainly exceeded expectations, but private universities have played a big role in this
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki kai padaavon par gunvattta se samjhauta kiya gaya he
 "sinha was one of the members of the committee that gave its report on higher education in India in 2008, considering issues related to expansion, inclusion, quality and finance
 sinha bataate hai ki sarkari dhan se chalane vaale pratishthit vishvavidhyalayon main bhi achche shikshakon kii kami he
 In 2014, the teacher-pupil ratio in universities and colleges was 24, compared to 14 in the US and 18 in England
 vah kehete hai, ''desh ke behtareen vishvavidhyalayon or unke adheen collejon main 5,000 se zyada pad khaali hai
 In many private universities, especially technical institutions, the list of faculty members is mostly fake
 ek shikshak 10 sansthaaon main padhaa rahaa ho saktaa he
 "all eyes on the new education policy are now all eyes on the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, where the process of formulating the new education policy is underway
 shiksha niti kii ruparekha tay karne ke liye banaai gai tii

 aar
 Subrahmanyam Committee has already given its report
 vishvavidhyalay shiksha kii kuch nishchit prashasnic rukaawaton ko dur karne ke liye echaradi mantralay ne haal hi main sudhaar ke kuch kadam uthaae hai
 For example, it has announced rules to allow deemed university status more quickly
 usne collejon or vishvavidhyalayon ke liye videshi vishvavidhyalayon ke saath milakar kaam karne ko bhi kuch zyada aasaan banaaya he
 The reality is that the NITI Aayog report suggested that the government should allow foreign universities to open their own campuses in India
 shikshakon kii kami badi samasyis tarah saath milakar kaam karne kaa swaagat kiya ja saktaa he, magar sarkaar ko ab bhi kuch buniyadi chijen durust kerani hongi
 Sinha says that good training does not depend on brick and mortar buildings, but on teachers
 nijee or sarkari donon kshetron main shiksha kii gunvattta tab behatar hogi jab khaali padon ko bhar sakane laayak behatar shikshak zyada taadaad main taiyaar karne ke kadam uthaae jaaenge

 Living and erupting volcanoes and rivers of lava emanating from them, they are moving ahead, destroying everything that comes in their way
 marane waalon kii tadad lagaataar bad rahi he
 However, these sholas have also raised many questions from inside themselves
 sawaal ye he ki aakhir zamin ke andar dadhakati aag kahaan se aati he? zamin ke neeche maujuud pathar kin halaat main aag kaa dariyaa ban jaati hai?jwalamukhika jwaala aakhir kitna garm hota he
 What would be the temperature of the flowing lava? The scenes of the fire and the creepy boiling and boiling and sholing on the ground are as dreadful as the pictures
 utani hi dilkash bhi
 Fascinating pictures of melting Sholay surprise each time
 vajah ye ki pathar jaisi sakht or bejaan chiz apane andar paidaa hui garmi se yun aag ke dariyaa main tabdeel ho sakati he, ye dekh kar or jaan kar bhi is par aasaani se yakeen nahin hota
 Because to this day, the stones you and we have actually seen around us are extremely hard, heavy and hard
 kuch itane sakht ki jab kisi sakht chiz kii misaal bhi di jaati he, to zikr pattharon kaa hi hota he
 How much is Lawe's temperature, but the story of Lawe melting at a temperature of 2,120 is something else
 ye sakht to nahin, lekin garm itani he ki apane raste main aanevaale har chiz kaa naamo-nishaan mitaa de

 bahata lava, tabaahi kaa manjarajwalamukhi se nikalate, pighalate or behate lave ko akhir is rup main aane ke liye kitni garmi kii zarurat hoti hogi? ye jaananaa hi apane-aap main kisi ajoobe se kam nahin he
 Because this temperature is 2,120 degrees Fahrenheit or many times more
 pighalate lave kii tasviren iskaa ahsaas to karaati hi hai, lekin lave ke saath-saath pighalate lohe kii in tasveeron ko dekh kar bhi aap is garmi ko samaj sakate hai
 Because it usually requires more than 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit to melt iron

 a lawmaker who has backed a new proposal being brought by members of the US Congress to demand the bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi to continue with the policy of not issuing visas, has disassociated himself from it
 isse pehle bhi ek saansad prastaav se dur hua tha
 According to the Hindu American Foundation (HAF), Republican Republican Scott Perry from Pennsylvania has withdrawn his co-sponsorship from Proposition 417 of the House of Representatives
 ab tak is prastaav par 42 saansadon ne hastakshar kiye hai
 Perry and Steve Cabot, both mps who pulled out of the resolution, are also members of the House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs
 aise unke faisle kii khaasi ahmiyat he
 Cabot parted ways with the proposal several weeks ago, while Perry made the decision last week after US Ambassador to India Nancy Powell met with Modi

 modi sarkaar ne apane pehle saal main raksha or beemaa sector main 49 pratishat videshi nivesh kaa faisla kar liya, maamuli virodh ke alaava bijepi yaa sangh parivaar ko isse koi khaas dikkat nahin hui
 Even if it did not matter to the government
 lekin jaise hi khudara kaarobaar main 51 pratishat faisle kii baat hoti he bijepi ko samaj nahin aata ki iskaa bachaav kaise kare
 But before that it has to be understood that the permission for foreign investment in retail business was received only in December 2012 when UPA was in power
 2012 main is kanoon ko paas karne ke liye loksabhaa main kya jabardast bahes hui thi
 Sibal took the front on behalf of the government and Sushma on behalf of the opposition
 sibbal kehete the ki 40 lakh logon tak rojgaar failega
 Sushma kept saying that the employment would end
 sibbal ne kaha ki khudara kaarobaar main videshi nivesh aane se bichauliye khatm ho jaaenge to sushamaa ne kaha ki aadhati gramin vyavastha kaa paaramparik atm he
 Marriage to farmers gives money at the time of illness

 Well, as soon as Sushma Swaraj took the side of the middle man, Sibal said that for the first time in history, someone has advocated usury in the House
 epadiai se bichauliye samaapt ho jaaenge
 The law has passed but since 2012 it is 2015
 us kanoon se khudara vyapaar main kitna paisa aayaa, kitne lakh logon ko rojgaar mila, kitna supplai chen bananaa shuru hua kisi ko kuch pataa nahin

 If this policy is useless, no one is coming then it should be abolished

 There should be a minimum investment of at least $ 100 million in this sector
 iskaa aadha paisa teen saal tak bacand infrastracchar taiyaar karne main laganaa chahie
 Processing, logistics, storage, warehouses, etc

 But like insurance, the opposition to foreign investment in multi-brand retail is overshadowing the BJP
 sitambar 2012 main ravishankar prasad ne kaha tha ki bijepi multi brands main videshi nivesh ke virodh main he
 It is not in the interest of farmers and small traders
 jab ham satta main aaenge to dekhiyegaa
 This statement has appeared in several newspapers including the Economic Times
 tab anand sharma ne kaha tha ki bijepi is faisle ko kanoonee taur se samaapt nahin kar sakati he
 The BJP is doing this by configuring investors so that they flee
 anand sharma kii daleel ab bhi di ja rahi he ki agar is kanoon ko palata gaya to niveshak kanfus ho jaaenge
 The question is why there is no talk of reversing the law which BJP is so opposed to
 yah itnaa aasaan nahin he
 The bjp's official website still contains the protest document and statements of leaders on the retail sector
 sushma swaraj, nitin gadakari, arun jetali, venkaiya naidu, rajnath singh, shivaraj singh chouhan, raman singh sahit pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bhi bayaan hai jisamen unhone tab kaha tha agar espi or bispi ke netaa epadiai kaa virodh karte hai to unhen bhi mamata banerjee kii tarah upie se apana samarthan le lenaa chahie

 This decision should be withdrawn
 tab anand sharma ne kaha tha ki aisa nahin ho saktaa he
 Can't be changed once you say yes
 ab yah bhi dekhnaa chahie ki kya vasundhara raaje sindhiya ne modi sarkaar kii vaanijya mantri nirmala sitaraman ko khat likhakar apni maang doharaai he
 Delhi Government Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has also said that in January 2014, the Center was told that we do not want foreign investment in retail

 DIPP Secretary Amitabh Kant in Economic Times has said that we have not opened the multi-brand retail sector
 magar unke vibhaag ke dastauez main nivesh kii jaankaree di gai he
 The comments nirmala sitaraman ne bhi bayaan diya he ki multi brands main epadiai automatic root se nahin he

 bijepi ne apane ghoshnaa patr main kaha tha ki epadiai kii niti jaisi he waisi rahegi
 Therefore, there is no change in policy
 hamane bijepi kaa ghoshnaa patr dekha jisamen kaha gaya he ki multi brands retail sector ko chhod kar jahaan bhi rojgaar or sansaadhan nirmaan kii sambhaavna hogi ham videshi nivesh sweekaar karenge

 jabaki unke vibhaag ke nae dastavej main multi brands vaale panne par saaf-saaf likhaa he ki jo companiyaan multi brands retail main shaamil hai wo i kamrs ke zariye is sector main nahin aa sakati he
 So what can be considered is that the government may consider allowing multi-brand retail in e-commerce and will not allow foreign investment in offline or super market multi-brand retail
 to multi brands retail main epadiai ko lekar saaf-saaf kah rahi he yaa gol mol
 On-line yes and off-line no

 So what can be considered is that the government may consider allowing multi-brand retail in e-commerce and will not allow foreign investment in offline or super market multi-brand retail
 to multi brands retail main epadiai ko lekar saaf-saaf kah rahi he yaa gol mol
 On-line yes and off-line no
 kanoon to paas ho gaya magar 2012 se yah 2015 he
 Nobody knows how much money came in retail business, how many lakhs of people got employment, how much supply chain started to be formed by that law
 nirmala sitaraman ne kaha he ki hamane pichley ek saal main kisi ko retail main epadiai kii anumati nahin di he
 Now no one told whether anyone had applied or not
 agar yah niti bekaar he, koi aa nahin rahaa he tab to ise bekaar maan samaapt hi kar diya janaa chahie
 The new controversy occurred when a department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce released its policy document on foreign investment
 jisamen multi brands retail main 51 pratishat videshi nivesh kii anumati ko barkaraar rakhaa gaya he
 It states that foreign investment will be allowed in multi-brand retail of all products
 is sector main kam se kam 10 karod dollar kaa nunatam nivesh hona chahie
 Half of this money should take three years to prepare the backend infrastructure
 prasanskaran, logistic, storage, godaam vagairah bacand infrastracchar hai
 Multi-brand retail chains can be opened in cities with a population of one million or more
 maamla thodaa purana ho gaya he isliye nitiyon ke kuch bindu ko pard diya
 It was decided to have 100 percent foreign investment in railways, from 49 percent in defense to 100 percent foreign investment in some cases, 49 percent foreign investment in insurance
 lekin beemaa kii tarah multi brands retail main videshi nivesh kaa virodh bijepi par baari pad rahaa he
 In September 2012, Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the BJP was opposed to foreign investment in multi-brand
 yah kisaanon or chote vyapaariyon ke hit main nahin he
 We will see when we come to power
 yah bayaan iconomic times sahit kai akhabaaron main chapa he
 Anand Sharma had then said that the BJP cannot legally end the decision
 bijepi aisa kar niveshkon ko kanfus kar rahi he taaki ve bhaag jaaen
 Anand Sharma's argument is still being given that investors will be confused if this law is overturned
 sawaal he ki jis kanoon se bijepi kaa itnaa virodh he use palatney kii baat kyon nahin hoti
 it's not that easy
 abhi bhi bijepi kii aadhakarik website par retail sector par virodh kaa dastauez or netaaon ke bayaan maujuud hai
 There are also statements of Sushma Swaraj, Nitin Gadkari, Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu, Rajnath Singh, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Raman Singh including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in which he said that if the SP and BSP leaders oppose FDI, then they too are Mamata Banerjee Like, take your support from UPA
 upie videshiyon kii sarkaar he, videshiyon ke dwaara sanchalit sarkaar he or videshiyon ke liye sarkaar he
 This will force the small traders to shut down

 The NDA took political risks of land acquisition changes and remained adamant
 multi brands retail main videshi nivesh kaa masalaa poochne par hi baahar aata he
 When Vasundhara Raje Singhia came to power in February 2014 before the Lok Sabha elections, she immediately wrote to Union Commerce Minister Anand Sharma to reverse the Gehlot government's decision that she did not want foreign investment in multi-brand retail in Rajasthan
 is faisle ko waapas liya jaae
 Then Anand Sharma said that this cannot happen
 ek baar haa kehane ke baad badla nahin ja saktaa
 Now it should also be seen whether Vasundhara Raje Scindia has repeated her demand by writing a letter to Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman of Modi government
 dilli sarkaar ke up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne bhi kaha he ki janvari 2014 main hi centre ko bataa diya gaya tha ki ham retail main videshi nivesh nahin chaahate hai
 We still have the same decision
 iconomic times main diipipi ke sachiv amitabh kaant ne kaha he ki hamane multi brands retail sector ko nahin kholaa he
 But the information about the investment is given in the document of his department
 tippaniyan Nirmala Sitharaman has also said that FDI in multi-brand is not on automatic route
 ise sarkaar ke root se aana hoga
 The BJP had said in its manifesto that FDI policy will remain as it is
 isliye niti main koi badlaav nahin he
 We saw the BJP manifesto which said that except for the multi-brand retail sector, wherever there is a possibility of employment and resource creation, we will accept foreign investment
 lekin i carmas udyog se jude logon ke sammelan main nirmala sitaraman ne yah kah diya ki i kamrs main epadiai ke maamle main koi faisla nahin liya he
 Whereas in the new document of his department, it has been clearly written on the multi-brand page that companies which are involved in multi-brand retail cannot come in this sector through e-commerce
 to kya mana jaae ki sarkaar i kamrs main multi brands retail ko anumati dene par vichaar kar sakati he or of line yani super market vaale multi brands retail main videshi nivesh kii anumati nahin degi
 So in the multi-brand retail, FDI is clearly telling or rounding up
 on line haa or of line na
 The new controversy occurred when a department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce released its policy document on foreign investment
 jisamen multi brands retail main 51 pratishat videshi nivesh kii anumati ko barkaraar rakhaa gaya he
 It states that foreign investment will be allowed in multi-brand retail of all products
 is sector main kam se kam 10 karod dollar kaa nunatam nivesh hona chahie
 Half of this money should take three years to prepare the backend infrastructure
 prasanskaran, logistic, storage, godaam vagairah bacand infrastracchar hai
 Multi-brand retail chains can be opened in cities with a population of one million or more
 maamla thodaa purana ho gaya he isliye nitiyon ke kuch bindu ko pard diya
 It was decided to have 100 percent foreign investment in railways, from 49 percent in defense to 100 percent foreign investment in some cases, 49 percent foreign investment in insurance
 lekin beemaa kii tarah multi brands retail main videshi nivesh kaa virodh bijepi par baari pad rahaa he
 In September 2012, Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the BJP was opposed to foreign investment in multi-brand
 yah kisaanon or chote vyapaariyon ke hit main nahin he
 We will see when we come to power
 yah bayaan iconomic times sahit kai akhabaaron main chapa he
 Anand Sharma had then said that the BJP cannot legally end the decision
 bijepi aisa kar niveshkon ko kanfus kar rahi he taaki ve bhaag jaaen
 Anand Sharma's argument is still being given that investors will be confused if this law is overturned
 sawaal he ki jis kanoon se bijepi kaa itnaa virodh he use palatney kii baat kyon nahin hoti
 it's not that easy
 abhi bhi bijepi kii aadhakarik website par retail sector par virodh kaa dastauez or netaaon ke bayaan maujuud hai
 There are also statements of Sushma Swaraj, Nitin Gadkari, Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu, Rajnath Singh, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Raman Singh including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in which he said that if the SP and BSP leaders oppose FDI, then they too are Mamata Banerjee Like, take your support from UPA
 upie videshiyon kii sarkaar he, videshiyon ke dwaara sanchalit sarkaar he or videshiyon ke liye sarkaar he
 This will force the small traders to shut down
 modi sarkaar kii ab kya pozishan he or kya bijepi koi alag pozishan lekar batch sakati he

 So in the multi-brand retail, FDI is clearly telling or rounding up

 The matter has become a bit old, so read some points of the policies
 railway main 100 fisadi videshi nivesh, raksha main 49 fisadi se lekar kuch maamalon main 100 fisadi videshi nivesh, beemaa main 49 fisadi videshi nivesh kaa faisla ho gaya
 But like insurance, the opposition to foreign investment in multi-brand retail is overshadowing the BJP
 sitambar 2012 main ravishankar prasad ne kaha tha ki bijepi multi brands main videshi nivesh ke virodh main he
 It is not in the interest of farmers and small traders
 jab ham satta main aaenge to dekhiyegaa
 This statement has appeared in several newspapers including the Economic Times
 tab anand sharma ne kaha tha ki bijepi is faisle ko kanoonee taur se samaapt nahin kar sakati he
 The BJP is doing this by configuring investors so that they flee
 anand sharma kii daleel ab bhi di ja rahi he ki agar is kanoon ko palata gaya to niveshak kanfus ho jaaenge
 The question is why there is no talk of reversing the law which BJP is so opposed to
 yah itnaa aasaan nahin he
 The bjp's official website still contains the protest document and statements of leaders on the retail sector
 sushma swaraj, nitin gadakari, arun jetali, venkaiya naidu, rajnath singh, shivaraj singh chouhan, raman singh sahit pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bhi bayaan hai jisamen unhone tab kaha tha agar espi or bispi ke netaa epadiai kaa virodh karte hai to unhen bhi mamata banerjee kii tarah upie se apana samarthan le lenaa chahie
 The UPA is a government of foreigners, a government run by foreigners and a government for foreigners
 isse chote vyapaaree apana shater down karne par majaboor ho jaaenge
 What is the position of Modi government now and can BJP survive by taking a different position
 endie ne bhoomi adhigrahan main badlaav kaa raajnneetik jokhim liya or adi rahi
 The issue of foreign investment in multi-brand retail comes out only when asked
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle farvari 2014 main jab vasundhara raaje singhia satta main ain to gahalot sarkaar ke faisle ko palatney ke liye turant us vakt kendriya vaanijya mantri anand sharma ko likh diya ki ve rajasthan main multi brands retail main videshi nivesh nahin chaahati hai

 Delhi Government Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has also said that in January 2014, the Center was told that we do not want foreign investment in retail
 hamaara ab bhi vahi faisla he
 DIPP Secretary Amitabh Kant in Economic Times has said that we have not opened the multi-brand retail sector
 magar unke vibhaag ke dastauez main nivesh kii jaankaree di gai he
 The comments nirmala sitaraman ne bhi bayaan diya he ki multi brands main epadiai automatic root se nahin he
 It has to come through the government route
 bijepi ne apane ghoshnaa patr main kaha tha ki epadiai kii niti jaisi he waisi rahegi
 Therefore, there is no change in policy
 hamane bijepi kaa ghoshnaa patr dekha jisamen kaha gaya he ki multi brands retail sector ko chhod kar jahaan bhi rojgaar or sansaadhan nirmaan kii sambhaavna hogi ham videshi nivesh sweekaar karenge
 But Nirmala Sitharaman at the conference of people associated with e-commerce industry said that no decision has been taken in the case of FDI in e-commerce
 jabaki unke vibhaag ke nae dastavej main multi brands vaale panne par saaf-saaf likhaa he ki jo companiyaan multi brands retail main shaamil hai wo i kamrs ke zariye is sector main nahin aa sakati he
 So what can be considered is that the government may consider allowing multi-brand retail in e-commerce and will not allow foreign investment in offline or super market multi-brand retail

 shiksha paanaa har kisi kaa adhikaar he, lekin har kisi ke naseeb main shiksha ko hasil karnaa aasaan nahin hota
 When six-year-old Vinnya Uike wakes up every morning with enthusiasm to attend her school, she not only learns about new things in the world but also plays with the attractive toys kept at school
 vinanya or bharat ke karodon anya schuli bacchon main jo antar he, vah yah he ki vinanya adivasee baigaa janajati se taalluk rakhti he, jiske liye plaskul ek agyaat si avadharana he
 Talking about the difference in schools, this school is located right in the middle of a famous tiger protected area in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh and the students studying in it are the children of the original inhabitants and forest officials
 baaghon ke ilaake main padhimukki jone sthit is skool kaa naam kanha tiger rigerv ke prasiddh shubhankar ke naam 'bhurasingh da barasingha' par rakhaa gaya, jisamen pehali baar janajaatiy bachche tasviir vaali pustakon, khilaunon or yahaan tak ki computer or projector se rubaru hue hai
 The school attracted children from ten neighboring villages, mostly belonging to the Baiga tribe
 kanha bhurasingh plaskul ne unhen van adhikariyon ke bacchon ke saath laane kaa kaam kiya
 They study together in 'smart classrooms', eat similar meals and play together on the playing field
 sharmile or dare-dare hai bachcheskul main padhaane vaali shikshika aashu bisen ne ek news agency ko bataaya ki zyaadaatar janajaatiy bachche behad sharmile va samvedansheel hote hai or shuruyaat main adhiktar dare-dare se rahete hai
 He said, "we have to negotiate with them very carefully and start from the very foundation
 adhikansh bacchon ke paas ghar par khilone nahin hote
 They are looking at computers, projectors and in some cases books with photographs for the first time
 hamen unke saath bahut dhairya rakhana hota he
 But, over time they have shown appreciable results
 57 saal baad mizoram sainik skool main 6 ladakiyon kii entry, aise huin selectakanha rashtriya udyaan ke sahaayak nideshak es
 K
 khare ne kaha ki yah vichaar janajaatiy bacchon ke bich hinabhaavna kii manogranthi ko khatm karne kaa he, jise ve mukhyadhara ke logon ke saath baatcheet karte vakt mahasoos karte hai
 Madhya Pradesh is one of the states with the highest tribal population, with a large number of them living around forests
 haalanki haashie par rahane vaale janajaatiy samudaayon ke bich shiksha ko lekar badhati jaagrukta ne unhen aksar shaharon kii ore jane ke liye protsaahit kiya he
 But tribal children often feel backward because they are unable to associate themselves with the children of the city
 khare ne bataaya, "ham yahaan mukhyadhara vaale bacchon or janajaatiy bacchon ke bich ke antar ko paatane kaa prayaas karte hai kyonki kisi na kisi din ye bachche yahaan se baahar niklenge or apane aap ko alag sa mahasoos paaenge
 Our goal is to create a foundation that when it goes to better and higher schooling, then do better there
 1 saal pehle khulaa tha scoolbaagh ke ilaake main yah skool 2017 main shuru hua tha
 The school runs in a bungalow, which was allotted to Khare at the time of his deployment here
 lekin, unhone ek chote se ghar main rahane kaa faisla kiya taaki bangale kaa behatar upyog kiya ja sake
 The bungalow has been reshaped by creating three classrooms, a computer lab, two projector rooms, a small library, a staff room and a kitchen
 anya 20 daankartaaon ke saath last wildernes foundation dwaara sanchalit is skool main van adhikari bhi apane bacchon ko bhejte hai
 The school provides education to children up to upper kindergarten
 skool main sabhi adhyaaapak van adhikariyon kii patniyaan hai
 Khare said that this school not only benefits the tribal children but also gives the children of the authorities a chance to develop sensitivity, wider acceptance and better understanding of diversity
 visheshkar jab ve apane sahpaathiyon se baatcheet karte hai, jo ki ek bilkul alag prishthbhumi se aate hai
 Those who have a different perspective and some of whom also have tribal tattoos on their bodies
 NIT uttarakhand ke paas nahin tha campus! 600 students ko bheja jaipurunhone kaha, "yah ek acchhee cheez he ki van adhikari or janajaatiy log, donon hi apane bacchon ko ek hi skool main bhejne se sankoch nahin karte

 Wearing an expensive watch does not make a good time
 insaan ke din nahin badalte
 But according to Vastu, the clock can change your time
 ghadi aapke ke samay ko acha ar bigaad bhi sakati he
 Today i will tell you that while looking at the clock of the house, take care of the special things so that your time will also be beautiful
 
 
 
 
 vaastu main ghar kii dakshin disha yama kii disha maani gai he
 Also, this direction is paused
 is disha main ghadi lagaana pragati ke avasaron ko dhimaa kar saktaa he
 Also, this direction is for the head of the household
 is disha main ghadi lagaana mukhiya ke swasthy ke liye acha nahin mana gaya he
 It is not considered good to place a clock above the main gate or door of the house
 aisa karnaa tanaav ko badha saktaa he
 Due to this, many types of negative energy can affect the clock while going out of the house, due to which you may face many problems
 ghadi ko ghar kii purv, pashchim yaa uttar disha main lagaana chahie
 a clock placed in the east direction maintains the atmosphere of the house auspicious and loving
 pashchim disha main ghadi lagane se ghar ke sadasyon ke nae avasaron kii prapti hoti he or uttar disha main lagaai gai ghadi ghar ko paison ke nuksaan se bachaati he
 By keeping the clocks closed, positive energy is reduced in the house and negativity increases
 yahi kaaran he ki ghar main band padi phaltu ghadiyaan va anya bekaar saamaan ko ghar se turant hataa dena chahie
 Also, do not put dust on the watch, it should also be taken care of
 kai log apni haath main pahani jaani vaali ghadi ko takiye ke neeche rakhkar sone kii aadat hoti he
 This habit is considered absolutely wrong according to Vastu
 aisa karne se manushya kii vichaardhaara par negative prabhaav padataa he or uskaa swabhaav bhi badalane lagata he
 Green and orange in the house and black and dark blue clock should not be installed in the shop
 isse ghar va dukaan main nakaaratmak urja kaa vaas hota he
 a square clock should be placed in the hall and bedroom in the hall of the house
 aisa karne se ghar main shanti or pyaar bana rahata he
 For pandulum clocks, it is believed that a person is going to remove the bad times of life and brings new hurdles to progress
 pandulum vaali ghadi ke liye bhi purv, pashchim yaa uttar disha hi shubh maani jaati he
 It is best to install such a clock in the drawing room
 sahi samay se aage yaa peeche chalane vaali ghadiyon ko bhi acha nahin mana jaataa he
 Such clocks can cause loss or loss to a human being, so the watch should always be set at the right time

 This conversation on the landmark verdict given by the Supreme Court on the validity of Aadhaar shows how effective this social media platform is for discussing national issues

 com / zvscesxhw4 varsh 2010 main, india today kii rajyon kii dasha-disha ke bare main prakashit report main krishi or sushasan kii shreniyon main 20 bade rajyon main assam sabase neeche tha
 The dice have been reversed in 2011 and Assam finds themselves in the first rank in both these categories this time
 sarvageen pragati: gujarat or maharashtra rahe awvalalekin bhaven tanen isse pehle hi saaf kar dena jaruri he ki india today ke pichley aath saal kii in reporton kii tulana main puri tarah alag tarika rajyon ko rank dene main apanaaya gaya he
 Health: Everyone gets free service in Haryana
 For the first time in our study, rank has been given to the states based on the improvements made by them in the last one year
 is saal rajyon ko rank dene ke liye jis avadhi kaa surveykshan kiya gaya he, vah 2009-10 or 2010-11 ke bich kii he
 To maintain consistency, like all previous surveys, the ranking has been done on the same eight categories (agriculture, primary health, consumer market, primary education, government operations, infrastructure, investment and macro economy) and the ninth category is the progress made in the remaining categories
 Is the gross total
 shashan: manipur or assam sabase behtareendervekshan ke nae tareeke kaa nateeja ranking main baari ulatpher ke rup main niklaa he
 States like Assam, which are always behind, have been liberated from the burden of loss of development for many years
 isi tarah punjab sareekhe rajya jo paramparaagat taur par ranking main sheersh par rahaa karte the, unase lambey samay tak viksit hone ke phaayde ko hataa diya gaya he
 Infrastructure: Himachal has shown a new ray of light
 Traditionally backward states like Assam may take a long time to compete with the leading states, even though it has outperformed in recent years
 shiksha: haryana or pudducheri ne maari baajikisi agua rajya kaa neeche tak patan hone main kaaphi samay lag saktaa he, bhale hi haal ke varshon main uskaa pradarshan apekshaakrit kamjor rahaa ho
 The fact we are assessing this year is the pace of change, marking the states that are in motion and isolating those states that are stuck
 is tarah, is package main aage die gaye aankadon or khabaron se jo cheez nikalakar aati he, vah bharat ke rajyon ke bare main haal kaa zyada gatiman akalan he
 Investment: Successful investing in Gujarat Last year, the Center had a policy stagnation - the UPA government was mired in corruption and scandals and delirium - but some states had impressive policy dynamics
 do shreniyon main puraskaar vijeta rajya assam main mukhyamantri tarun gogoi ne thos uplabdhiyon ke aadhaar par satta main lagaataar tisare kaarykaal ke liye jeet hasil kii
 The state is benefiting from the rapid reforms in law and order and special schemes benefiting the farmers of the state
 vrahat arthvyavastha: maharashtra urja shakti se saraborashiksha or swasthya ke kshetra main sarvaadhik sudhaar ke liye puraskaar praapt karne vaale haryana main mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ne un abhinav yojanaon kii aguai kii he, jinhone rajya ke saamaajik kshetron main sudhaar laa diya he, un kshetron main jahaan vah paramparaagat taur par pichhadaa rahata tha
 Both the well performing states are Congress ruled
 maharashtra sabase unnat vrihat arthvyavastha he or gujarat ke saath yah samgr taur par sabase unnat rajya he
 Consumer Markets: Uttarakhand and Goa are the best cleaners
 Prithviraj Chavan, who was released in November 2010 from the Prime Minister's Office in Parachute to Mumbai, has been a factor of change
 lagaataar badlaav karne kaa narendra modi kii tarah record rakhane vaale mukhyamantri kam hi rahe hai
 For a decade in power, they have been struggling to make Gujarat a more attractive destination for industries
 ku chha hi maheenon main gujarat aa rahe maaruti sujuki ke haryana ke baahar pehle sanyantr samet badi pariyojnaon ke dher ke aadhaar par ve rajyon main nivesh kii daud jeet rahe hai
 Farming: Mizoram and Assam are the leading states in the category of small states, the northeastern states - Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Manipur have outpaced states like Delhi and Goa in most categories
 is saal ek mukhyamantri kii maut or duusare ke istife ke baavjood arunachal pradesh sabase zyada unnat chota rajya he, jo kendriya aarthik package or urja kshetra main baari-bharkam nivesh kaa phayda uthaa rahaa he
 Mizoram has done very well in terms of farming, due to changes in the land use policy, which has led to an increase in rice production
 rashtriya swasthya beemaa yojana or mizoram rajya swasthya raksha yojana par prabhavi amal se swasthya ke kshetra main bhi vah sheersh par he
 The common belief is that India is ruled by New Delhi
 vastav main rajyon kii rajdhaniyaan ab zyada mahatvapurn hone lagi hai
 After the abolition of the quota-permit raj that began in 1991, the second generation of economic reforms required physical infrastructure facilities, heavy investment in the social sector (education and health) and effective execution and metamorphosis in farming
 in sabhi main rajya hi ahm kartadharta hai
 The Center may control the money received, but it is up to the states to formulate effective implementation strategies
 gujarat or maharashtra jaise pashchim ke audyogic urja strot rajya ise pehle hi samaj chuke hai
 Actually, the growth rate in Gujarat has been in double digits for many years
 baaki rajya bhi dekhadekhi kar rahe hai
 Bihar, which invested heavily in infrastructure led by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, has grown at a rate of 14 per cent in 2010-11
 rajya main khastahal saarvajanik vitaran pranali ko umdaa bana dene vaale sudhaarwadi dow
 Growth rate in Chhattisgarh led by Raman Singh 11
 5 fisadi rahi he
 In comparison, the all-india average has been just 8 percent
 centre sarkaar sakal vikaas kii ruparekha khinch sakati he, lekin achche shashan vaale rajya nishchit taur par simaaon ko aage dhakel sakate hai or apane nagarikon ke kalyaan main ijapha kar sakate hai

 Delhi government's sacked minister Kapil Mishra, who is constantly attacking the leadership of the Aam Aadmi Party, will probably not be expelled from the party
 aam aadmi party (aap) ke sutron ne bataaya ki party se nikaalane par baagi vidhayak ko kisi anya party main shaamil hone yaa dilli vidhansabha main alag samooh banane kaa mauka mil jayega or party aisa nahin chaahati he

 The AAP suspended Mishra's allegations, denying him the charges
