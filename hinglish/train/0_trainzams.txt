 Sources have informed Aaj Tak that Pakistan is making posts of such new Pakistan Marines on the Shah border in front of Gujarat border of India
 isse pehle khufia agenciyon ne bhi jaankaree di thi ki pakistan jivani se lekar sarkreek tak ke ilaake main apni navy ke 8 nae objaraveshan post bana rahaa he taaki wo kaaphi dur tak bhartiya navy or costguard kii gatividhiyon par najar rakh sake
 According to the report, Pakistan will monitor Indian Navy warships and Coast Guard through it

 This is the reason why Pakistan is doing this kind of construction work

 dekha jaae to sarkreek se sate karachi kaa neval base he or aise main karachi base ko zyada surakshit karne ke liye pakistan navy sarkreek main apni upasthit badha rahi he

 com / uuq6rrzm4n India successfully test-fired agni-ii, a medium-range missile capable of carrying nuclear weapons, on Sunday
 2000 kilometre se zyada duuri kii maarak kshamta rakhane vaali is missile kaa odisha ke tat se pare sthit whealer dweep se pareekshan kiya gaya
 Defense officials said, "the surface-to-surface missile was tested at 9:40 am from the launch complex-4 of the Integrated Test Range
 ’ is praayogic pareekshan ko puri tarah safal bataate hue itiar ke nideshak em ve ke ve prasad ne kaha, ‘yah sena kii ore se kiya gaya ek praayogic pareekshan tha
 The officials said that the Agni-2 Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) has already been inducted into the services and the test has been carried out today by the specially formed strategic force command of the army
 yah raksha anusandhan evam vikaas sanghathan (diardio) kii ore se uplabdh karwaae gaye sajo-saamaan ke saath kiye jane vaale prashikshan abhyaas kaa hissaa he
 a DRDO scientist said, 'the entire test circuit was monitored through sophisticated radars, telemetry observation stations, electro-optical instruments and navigational vessels deployed at sea near the point of impact
 ’ agni-2 missile 20 meter lambii he or thos propalent se sanchalit hone vaali belistic missile he
 It weighs 17 tonnes and can carry 1000 kg of material for more than 2000 kilometers
 agni-2 missile kaa vikaas advanced systams leboratory (aesel) ne kiya or ise samaklit karne kaa kaam hyderabad kii bharat dianemics limited ne kiya
 Agni-2 is part of Agni series missiles developed by DRDO, including Agni-1 (700 km), Agni-3 (3000 km), Agni-4 (4000 km) and Agni-5 (more than 5000 km)
 Are included

 (input language) smartphone lock karne ke kai tareeke hai jinamein sabase kaaman pin lock he
 Apart from this, pattern lock, fingerprint and face unlock are included
 in sabhi tareekon main kuch tareeke kamjor hai jinhen havers aasaani se bhed sakate hai
 Hackers broke Android's pattern lock as well
 haal hi main aipal kii phase idi bhi crack kar lee gai
 Researchers at Nanyang Technology University in Singapore have discovered a new way by which a smartphone's lock can be unlocked through its sensor
 itnaa hi nahin researchrs ne daawa kiya he ki yah tarika 99
 Works 5 percent of the time and devices are unlocked
 smartphone ke pin ko analock karne ke liye researchrs ne isame lagechh sensors kaa istemaal kiya he
 In this process, the researchers tried to know the PIN of the smartphone through the sensors installed in the Android smartphone and tried by putting a separate PIN of four digits each time
 aisa lagbhag 70 baar kiya gaya isamen pin code predict karne ke liye mashin larning kaa bhi istemaal kiya gaya
 This team of researchers have used accelerometers, barometers, gyroscopes, magnometers, ambient light sensors and proximity sensors provided in smartphones
 jin smartfones main ise test kiya gaya unhone paaya he ki isamen 50 sabase kaaman pin main se ek daale gaye the
 Researchers also believe that this is a flaw of smartphone security
 kyonki sensor ko yuj karne ke liye yugers se parmishan kii jarurat hoti he
 These permissions are taken by you when most Android apps are installed, which are necessary
 yani agar koi haikar ek ap ke jariye aapke sensor ko yuj karte hue pin analock kar de to koi chaunkaane vaali baat nahin he
 Shivam Bhashin, the lead researcher of this project, said, 'you hold your smartphone and use the keys for the PIN and the way the phone moves to press 1, 5 or 9 is quite different
 jaise 1 ko press karne ke liye aap apane daaen anguuthe kaa istemaal karte hai to yah 9 press karne se zyada lite block karata he’ isi pattern ko sensor ke jariye dicode karke havers pin kaa pataa laga sakate hai

 In such a situation, we are telling you what is encephalitis and what are the measures to prevent and identify it? vaishvik kedit reating agency mudies ke vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki bhartiya arthvyavastha par is samay raajnneeti haaavee he or yahi vajah he ki yah apni vaastavik kshamta se kam gati se vruddhi kar rahi he
 Moody's described the central government as the 'biggest hurdle' in terms of business activities in the country
 mudies kii yah report aise samay aayi he jabaki buudhvaar ko hi uski hi tarah kii agency es and pi ne nivesh ke liye bharat kii saakh ko sthir se nakaaratmak shrenee main daal di he
 Moody's senior economic analyst Glenn Levine said in a report that India's economic outlook is still being underestimated and its economic growth is below expectations due to poor management
 levin ne kaha, ‘bharat ke aarthik paridrishy main sabase bada mudda khud bharat sarkaar bani hui he
 In all economies, it is impossible to separate the economic scenario from its political scenario and this is a particularly important issue in the case of India
 ’mudies kii is report main kaha gaya he, ‘naram vaishvik paristhitiyaan, kamjor niveshak or vyavsaayik vishwaas, sarkari str par dheelaapan or kadi maudrik niti in sabhi kaa maang par asar padaa he
 Slowness persists in almost all sectors and has the highest impact on the manufacturing and mining sectors, as well as a worrisome situation in private investment
 ’pichley vitt varsh kii aakhri timahi main bharat kii sakal gharelu utpaada vruddhi 6
 It was reduced to 1 percent
 varsh 2008 ke baad yah sabase dhimi vruddhi thi
 "given the difficult political situation, the risk of moderation is still high, although there are some expectations, we expect economic growth to pick up in 2012 but to reach full capacity by the second half of 2013," the report said
 There is no hope
 ’mudies ne kaha he, ‘bharat sarkaar ne sabhi maukey ganvaa diye hai or ab bhoomi sudhaar, eendhan sabsidi, shram adhikaar or bahucharchit khudara kshetra main sudhaaron ke vidheyak par ab se agle aam chunaav 2014 tak kisi pragati kii ummid nahin dikhaai detii he
 In this Moody's report, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has been described as' an old technocrat who seems tired of Indian politics going through bad times
 ’isamen aage kaha gaya he sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) ke paas jaruri sudhaaron ko aage badhaane ke liye puri sankhya nahin he, athwa uske paas ahm sudhaaron ko aage badhaane vaale netaa nahin rahe hai
 The report also points to India's political risks
 china ke saath uske tanaav kii taraf ishaara karte huye kaha gaya he ki haal main lambii duuri vaali agni missile pareekshan iskaa abhas detaa he
 Maoist activities across the country also pose a threat to him
 desh ke nau rajyon main iskaa asar bad rahaa he
 However, early predictions from the Reserve Bank of India to cut policy rates by half a percent and better monsoon are among the good news for India
 aane vaale dinon main inkaa behatar asar dikhaai pad saktaa he
 Whether the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) victory is linked to the communalism or the RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's statement about Hindu Rashtra, but the reality is that the thinking of the voters does not seem to lie around these issues
 
 ayodhya main ram mandir kaa nirmaan, ganga kii safai, 24 ghante muft bijli or farrate bharti chamchamati sadak jaise mudde nahin, balki logon kii praathamiktaaon main mahangaai, bhrashtachar, garibi mitaao or mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh rokna he
 This thinking is especially for the people of the states like Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, where the Modi wave waved in the Lok Sabha elections and almost non-nda parties in these states
 The soup cleared
 narendra modi kii sarkaar banane ke baad pehali baar india today group or hansaa research ne desh kaa mizaaj bhaanpane kii koshish kii to logon ne bebaaki ke saath apni raay rakhi
 One-third of the non-nda-ruled states like Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand want the Modi government to focus on poverty reduction first
 jabaki bijepi shasit madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or sapa shasit upi main aisi aas rakhane vaale logon kii sankhya ek-chauthai ke kareeb he
 In Rajasthan, 16-16 percent expect poverty reduction and crime against women to decrease
 lekin chaunkaane vaale aankade ram mandir nirmaan ko lekar hai kyonki pehali baar bijepi kii bahumat kii sarkaar banane ke baad aisa mana ja rahaa he ki is disha main modi sarkaar thos kadam uthaaegi
 It is evident from the survey that issues like temple, Ganga cleaning do not matter in the eyes of the people
 unki najar main garibi ke alaava mahangaai or bhrashtachar jaise mudde pramukh hai or log modi sarkaar se bhi isi mudde ko praathamikta dene kii ummid rakhte hai
 This is the reason why people do not have much enthusiasm about giving priority to Ganga cleaning campaign and provision in budget
 surveykshanon main modi sarkaar kii praathamiktaaon ko lekar puche gaye sawaal main mandir nirmaan ko praathamikta dene ke paksh main mahaj ek se do fisadi hi log hai
 It is clear that 65 percent of the country's population is young, which now seeks to pursue the development agenda instead of temple-mosque and achieve quick results
 hindi pattee ke in rajyon main 70 fisadi se zyada log vikaas ke agenda ko loksabhaa chunaav main modi kii prachand jeet kii vajah maanate hai to ek-chauthai ke lagbhag log aise bhi hai jo is jeet ko dhruvikaran kii raajnneeti kaa nateeja bataate hai
 Yet people are seeing BJP as the best party to solve the country's problem
 modi kii lokapriyata aaj bhi sir chadhakar bol rahi he, jisase kader aadhaarit yah party vyakti kendrit hone kii ore agrasar dikh rahi he
 Among those who credited Modi for the recent BJP victory, 79 are from Bihar, 60 from Chhattisgarh, 66 from Jharkhand and 71 percent from UP
 isamen shaq nahin ki modi hi iklaute shaks hai jinhone desh main bijepi ke liye lahar paidaa kii
 But the up's success is being credited to bjp's current national president Amit Shah, in surveys, people attribute the victory of UP to more former national president Rajnath Singh than Shah
 jahaan desh main 51 fisadi log bijepi ko niyantaa ke taur par dekh rahe hai, vahaan hindi pattee ke rajyon main aisi soch rakhane waalon kii sankhya rashtriya ausat se kahin zyada he
 This is the reason that if excluding Rajasthan, even in the event of elections, the seats of NDA are seen increasing in these states
 in saat rajyon kii kul 204 loksabhaa siton main se 191 par endie jeet sakati he, jabaki teen maheene pehle sampann loksabhaa chunaav main endie ko inhen rajyon main 181 siten hasil hui thim
 That is, even after three months, the NDA seems to get an edge of 10 seats
 upi main to endie kaa aankada badhkar 71 se 76 hone kaa anumaan he jabaki mulaayam singh yadav kaa sapai kunba or congress do-do siton tak simat saktaa he
 There are two types of opinions in these states regarding the Sangh's control over the Modi government
 rajasthan, chhattisgarh or uttarakhand ke zyadatar logon kaa maananaa he ki sangh ko haaavee hone dene kii bajaae modi donon taraf saamanjasy banaakar chalenge, jabaki madhya pradesh, uttar pradesh jaise rajyon ke log maanate hai ki modi kisi bhi surat main sangh kii kathputli nahin banenge
 In these states as Prime Minister Modi is the choice of people above the national average
 modi sarkaar ke ab tak ke kaamkaaj ko acha maanane waalon main sarvaadhik log uttar pradesh or jharkhand se hai, jahaan bijepi kii sarkarein nahin hai
 Another big opinion has emerged about Modi in the survey
 jahaan raajnneeti or rajanetaaon ko log anya peshon ke mukaable sabase bhrasht maanate hai, vahaan raajnneeti main sabase eemaandaar hone kaa tamgaa bhi modi ko hi miltaa dikh rahaa he
 The most surprising thing in this is that former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who calls himself honest, has also lagged behind Modi in this matter
 rashtriya str par modi ko 36 fisadi log eemaandaar maanate hai to kejariwal ko mahaj 4 fisadi
 However, in Delhi 25% of people consider Modi as honest and 24% as Kejriwal
 madhya pradesh main modi ko 27 fisadi to mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko 24 fisadi log eemaandaar maanate hai
 That is, there is a tough competition between the two BJP leaders here
 rajasthan main modi ko apni hi party kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje se kahin chunauti milti nahin dikh rahi
 38 per cent of the people in the state consider Modi to be an honest leader, and only 6 per cent see Vasundhara Raje in this category
 haalanki modi sarkaar se garibon ko sabase zyada phayda hone kii ummid hindi pattee ke logon main bhi he, lekin bihar, rajasthan, upi jaise rajya main 10 se 13 fisadi log maanate hai ki is sarkaar se korporate zyada labhanvit honge
 People of the Hindi belt still believe that among the best leaders for the post of Prime Minister from BJP, there are many names besides Modi
 inamen laalkrishna adwani, sushamaa swaraj, arun jetali or rajnath singh jaise netaa hai
 But in Madhya Pradesh, where 47 percent of the people want to see Modi as Prime Minister, 31 percent of people also tell Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan their choice for this post
 rajdhani dilli main 16 disambar ko chalati bas main medical kii chaatra ke saath hui haivaaniyat ke gavaah or peedita ke dost avaneendra pandey ne kaha he ki gangrape ke sabhi darindon ko faansee kii sajaa honi chahie

 unhone kaha ki jo bhi kiya vah apni dost or samaaj ke liye kiya or yahi unka ferj thi
 He said, 'we sit in the drawing room and talk well
 samaaj badalane kii baat karte hai, lekin apane hi ghar kii mahilaon ke saath hinsa karte hai
 First of all it should stop
 'unhone bataaya ki wo or unki dost kai der tak sadak par pade rahe, lekin koi madad ke liye aage nahin aayaa
 He said, 'the biggest question is what are we doing? If we do not raise our hands for help, then society will not exist
 'isi ke saath avaneendra kaha ki vaardaat ke baad wo unki dost hi thi jinhone unhen ladane kaa hausala diya
 He said, 'my friend was hurt more than me
 uski haalat bahut kharaab thi, lekin wo mujhe ladane kaa hausala de rahi thi
 Whenever i went to the hospital to meet her, she used to ask just how much the treatment would cost
 'gauratlab he ki desh bhar ko jhakzor dene vaali ye vaardaat 16 disambar, 2012 kii sard raat kii he
 The girl had left with her friend Avanindra Pandey after watching the movie 'life of Pi'

 US President Barack Obama announced on Tuesday that no new Guantanamo prisoners would be transferred to Yemen

" ’’ yaman ke bare main unhone kaha ‘‘aapane suna hoga ki america raashtrapati ke up rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar jaan briken ne kaha he ki kisi kaidi ko uske desh sthanantarit kiya jayega kyonki hamen is baat par bharosa nahin he ki yaman sarkaar aise maamle se nipat sakegi
 Gibbs said, "following the developments in Yemen over the last few weeks and the changes in security situation, the President and the Attorney General have agreed that it is not the right policy to send any prisoner there at present
" ’’ obama ne raashtrapati banane ke tatkaal baad hi guantanamo jail ko ek saal main band karne kii baat kahi thi
 But there are no chances of completion of the target
 gibs ne kaha ki is jail ko band karne kii taarikh abhi tay nahin kii gai he

 pradhanmantri ujjwala yojana ke tahat milane vaale gas silendar ke saath 50 lakh rupee tak kaa insurance ekadam free miltaa he
 This means that if the LPG cylinder bursts during cooking or an accident occurs, the victim's family can get compensation of up to Rs 50 lakh
 ek survey ke mutabik, hindustan main har saal kam se kam 100 silendar fatne kii ghatnaayen saamne aati hai, lekin aksar log iske muaavje se sirf isliye vanchit rah jate hai, kyonki unako isaki jaankaree nahin hoti he
 This insurance company offers compensation
 iske liye alpiji companiyaan apane kanjumar ke liye insurance companiyon se public libility policy leti hai
 This is third party insurance
 iske liye alpiji companiyaan har saal insurance companiyon ko moti rakam detii hai
 For this, the consumer does not have to pay any money
 is public libility policy ke tahat vyakti vishesh ke naam insurance nahin hota he, balki us alpiji kanjumar or uske parivaar ke liye hota he, jiske saath koi haadasa hota he
 This means that if there is an accident with the consumer, the insurance companies pay compensation to the victim and his family under a public liability policy
 agar peedit paksh ko muaavja dene main companiyaan anakani karti hai yaa peedit paksh muaavja raashi se santusht nahin he, to vah court kaa darwaja khatkhata saktaa he
 In case of any accident from LPG cylinder, the court decides the amount of compensation based on the age, income and other conditions of the victim
 aamtaur par dekha jaataa he ki alpiji silendar fatne se ghar ko nuksaan hota he, ghar ke sadasyon ko chot aati he or kai baar logon kii maut tak ho jaati he
 The compensation here is decided on the basis of loss
 muaavja kii rakam insurance companiyaan detii hai, lekin iske liye peedit ko clem karnaa padataa he
 If the aggrieved party does not claim for this compensation, it does not receive compensation
 isaki vajah yah he ki insurance companiyaan yah muaavja public libility policy ke tahat detii hai, jisamen kisi vyakti vishesh kaa naam nahin hota he
 Therefore, only the claimant gets compensation

 BJP questioned the 'special silence' of some leaders in the case of alleged sexual harassment of a woman journalist by Tehelka's former editor Tarun Tejpal and said that they were on the incident of rape and murder of Nirbhaya last year Was quite vocal and is not commenting yet
 rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne apane fasebuk pej par likhaa he ki tejpal dwaara ek yuva patrkaar ke saath kathith yon utpeedan kii ghatana par usee prakaar kii naaraazgi jataayi ja rahi he, jis prakaar pichley saal disambar main nirbhaya maamle main dekhi gayi thi
 Without naming the Congress, he said that some leaders were silent in the Tejpal case
 bijepi ne aarope lagaaya he ki tejpal congress ke kareebi hai or isliye sattarudh dal unki aalochana nahin kar rahaa he
 Recalling the Nirbhaya case, Jaitley said that there were demonstrations across the country and socially conscious citizens, especially the youth, demonstrated in New Delhi for several days
 jetali ne kaha, ‘kaiyon kii ek duusare se pratispardhaa thi taaki apni naaraazgi jataane main media main adhik sthaan paa saken
 Everyone was more vocal than each other
 ek yuva patrkaar dwaara apane sampadak ke khilaaf gambhir aarope lagaae jane ke baad usee prakaar kii bahes ho rahi he
 Many have commented clarifying their position
 kuch log aise hai jo chuppi saadhe hue hai
 Can we know the reason for this? star 3
 5 Director: Mohit Surikalakar: Ritesh Deshmukh, Siddharth Malhotra and Shraddha Kapoor Mohit Suri's films always have a dark factor and even in a villain, that factor remains from the beginning to the end of the film and this factor also does magical work
 pehla aisa mauka hoga jab film main villans kii bharmaar he
 The story is fun
 kahin thodi ulajhaau lagati he lekin mohit apane diarection se ise bakhubi khinch le jate hai, or phir shraddha, ritesh or siddharth kii tikdi ne bhi apni acting se ise chaar chand lagane kaa kaam kiya he
 The film keeps it tied and has all the spice that draws the audience, ranging from the best music to the thrilling moment
 acting or diarection film kii khaasiyat banakar ubharate hai
 How much Damguru (siddharth) meets Ayesha (shraddha) in the story and her naughty style becomes crazy
 lekin wo ek sthaneey gunde ke liye kaam karata he
 At the same time, Rakesh (ritesh) is deeply saddened by the curse of his wife
 bas ye sabhi kirdaar ek-duusare kaa rasta katate hai or phir kuch apratyaashit ghatnaon kaa silsilaa shuru ho jaataa he
 Which is full of mystery, adventure and bloodshed
 ek villen he, ek hero jaisaa villen he or cychik villen he
 Means a glut of villains
 ek villen dakshin korian film aai so da devil kaa bhartiya sanskaran he
 But the tremendous art of capturing Mohit's characters emerges here
 kahani kehane kaa unka anoothaa andaaj he or mohit kaa hunar videshi kahani ko desi andaaj main mast andaaj main kahana he
 
 star apilaritesh deshmukh kii hamashakals ne pichley hafte box offis par acha-khaasaa hallaa-bol kiya tha
 This week he is again on the test of audience
 film main unki acting behtareen he or yah unke yaadgaar kirdaaron main se ek ban padaa he
 Ritesh lives in the film
 siddharth malhotra bhi engri yangamain ke taur par nikharkar saamne aae hai
 Looking at them, it seems that it has become the beginning of a big star
 ve acshan karte jamate he or dard bahut hi badhiya andaaj main bayaan karte hai
 Shraddha changes the whole atmosphere as soon as she comes on screen
 aashiqui-2 vaala unka jaadu barkaraar he
 Apart from this, Aamna Sharif, who became the wife of Remo Fernandez and Ritesh, is also seen giving his best
 kamai kii batfilm medium bajet bataai jaati he, or mohit suri kii yah khaasiyat rahi he ki ve kam bajet main mega hit dene main maahir he
 The music of the film can be called its x factor
 iske alaava suspence or romaanch ko darshak pasand bhi karte hai
 Masala connecting youth is also present in the film
 siddharth or shraddha pehle hi youth audiyans kii kasuti par hansi to fansi or aashiqui-2 ke jariye khare utar chuke hai
 The speed of the film is also good, and does not look drawn
 priyanka gandhi ko congress adhyaksh banane kii maang tej ho gai he
 The response of Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh has been revealed in this episode
 mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne somvaar ko kaha ki agar priyanka gandhi wadra ko congress adhyaksh ke rup main chunaa jaataa he to unhen har taraf se samarthan milegaa
 He, however, regretted Rahul Gandhi's decision to step down from the party's top post
 captain amarinder ne kaha ki priyanka party kii bagdor sanbhaalane ke liye ek sahi vikalp hongi, lekin ye sab congress varking cameti (seedblusi) par nirbhar karegaa
 The CWC alone is authorized to take a decision in this matter
 unhone purv kendriya mantri shashi tharur kii baton kaa samarthan kiya
 Earlier, former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor also called the youth leadership necessary for the Congress
 tharur ne priyanka gandhi kaa naam bhi le liya tha
 Tharoor hoped that Priyanka Gandhi's name would be carried forward
 haalanki unhone yah bhi sweekaar kiya ki iskaa faisla gandhi parivaar ko karnaa he
 He said that Priyanka has the ability to unite the activists
 idhar, congress netaa manish tiwari ne kaha ki jab koi party stand leti he to vah party se jude maamalon par stand leti he
 It is worth mentioning that after a bitter defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, Rahul Gandhi resigned from the post of National President taking responsibility for it
 rahul ne swayan to pad to choda hi tha, yah bhi kah diya tha ki aglaa adhyaksh gandhi parivaar ke baahar kaa ho
 Rahul's statement almost put an end to the speculation of Congress National General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi becoming president
 media se baatcheet ke dauraan captain amarinder singh ne kaha ki ne unnav balaatkaar peedita se sambandhit ghatnaayen chaunkaane vaali hai
 They said, 'are we living in the jungle raj? The victim should get justice at all costs
 ' The self-proclaimed saint Asaram Bapu will still have to remain in judicial custody

 tulsiki pattiyaan kuch khaas dinon main nahin todani chahie
 Do not break the leaves of Tulsi during lunar eclipse, Ekadashi and Sunday
 suryaast ke baad bhi tulsi kii pattiyaan nahin todani chahie
 It is considered inauspicious to do so
 - mana jaataa he kibhagwan krishnake bhoga main or satyanarayan kii katha ke prasad main tulsi kii pattee jarur rakhni chahie
 Prasad is not considered complete by not doing so
 - ghar main tulsi kaa paudha hona shubh hota he
 In front of this, lighting a lamp in the evening every day brings happiness and prosperity in the house
 - manyata he ki tulsi hone se ghar main nakaaratmak urja nahin aati
 Scientifically, Tulsi also has many benefits - Tulsi is also used as a medicine
 aapke ghar ke peeche yaa ghar main tulsi hone se machhar or chote-chote keede nahin aate
 Eating basil leaves daily is good for health
 tulsi main bimariyon se ladane ke gun hai
 It increases the body's ability to fight against diseases
 - tulsi kii pattiyaan khaane se khun saaf rahata he
 This keeps your skin and hair healthy

 The Congress is committed to waiving the loans of farmers, power puri-bill half, justice to daughters, promotion of industries, employment of youth, hopes of tribals and confidence of the poor
 kagress adhyaksh ne kaha ki kisaanon ko karj se ubaarane kaa arth he arthvyavastha kaa ubarna
 If the farmer is financially prosperous, then the country's economy will also be back on track
 unhone kaha ki congress ke prayaason se desh kii raajnneeti kaa rukh kisaan kendrit ho gaya he
 Otherwise there was a time when at the behest of a few capitalists, Modi ji was bringing ordinance against farmers on ordinance to grab farmers' land

 Sweet dreams Kiran Bedi, an aide of social activist Anna Hazare, on Thursday made it clear that Anna is on an indefinite hunger strike and not on fast unto death
 unhone kaha, jitne lambey samay tak vah bhukh hadtaal kar sakate hai, vah karenge
 But the moment the doctors, led by Dr
 Naresh Trehan, think, they will be taken care of, because it is an indefinite hunger strike and it is not a fast unto death
 anna hajaare ko chikitsa seva die jane par sarkaar ke saath koi takaraav nahin hone kaa sanket dete hue kiran bedi ne kaha ki ve hajaare ke anshan par hue is samjhaute ko ek paksh kii jeet or duusare kii haar ke rup main nahin dekhati hai
 Kiran said, as long as he is able to stay on strike, he will do it, he will go on hunger strike, as long as there is no threat to his life
 unhone kaha ki hajaare kaa virodh pradarshan keval anshan nahin, balki dharna bhi he
 He said that the issue was linked to Hazare's health and hence the government doctors and doctors of his choice would supervise his health, which would be monitored by Dr
 Trehan
 kiran ne kaha, unki sehat ko bigadane nahin diya ja saktaa

 iske alaava vah vidhansabha main bhi is mudde ko uthaa chuke hai, lekin sarkaar kii ore se is par koi dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa
 So they have decided to do Satyagraha

 In such a situation, after taking action against two party mps, now everyone's eyes are on Pushkar and Kejriwal

 'ajtak' ke sho 'sidhi baat' main is baar yoga guru baba ramdev ne sidhe sawaalon kaa saamana kiya
 He unambiguously answered questions related to PM Modi to UP CM Yogi Adityanath
 ramdev ne kaha ki unke sambandh sabhi dalon se behatar hai, chahen wo bijepi ho yaa congress
 Ramdev also spoke on central government policies, flaws and support in the 2019 election

 Honoring PM from Trump to Putin Ramdev said that Narendra Modi is the first PM of India, who is respected by US President Donald Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin and also the President of Japan and China
 piem modi jahaan khadey hote hai, vah desh ke sava sau karod logon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 There are many businessmen with GST, on the functioning of the angry government, Ramdev said that the government laid a network of roads, implemented GST for one country-one tax
 tex paardarshita laane kaa pehla charan paar kiya
 a lot of traders are angry with GST, but some problems have to be raised initially
 haalanki ab ham usase bhi ubar chuke hai
 i am not campaigning for anyone
 Like 2014, will Ramdev also support BJP or campaign for it in 2019? On this question, Ramdev said that i am not campaigning for anyone, but the intention and leadership of PM Modi is for the good of the country
 modi ji se logon kii apekshaayen bhi zyada hai
 How much will Modi ji get in this, it has to be seen
 meri to kaamana he ki vah apane abhiyaan main safal hon
 i also support good works, because there is no greater interest than national interest and no religion greater than nationalism
 sabase acchhee yojana ke sawaal par liya ujjwala kaa namsarkaar kii sabase acchhee yojana ke sawaal par ramdev ne kaha ki ujjwala yojana chaar saal main centre sarkaar kii sabase acchhee yojana he
 There were tears in the poor mother's eyes while making bread
 7-8 karod logon ko iskaa phayda mila he
 The Ayushman Bharat scheme has not been implemented yet, but it will benefit 50 crore people
 isliye yah yojana bhi ahm he
 Not taken on the worst plan, on the question of the worst or the worst plan of the government, Ramdev said why Modi ji would like bad, but there are some things
 vaise main sanyasi hum or laabh-haani ke liye kaam nahin karata
 We have done charity of more than 11 thousand crores

 There was a slight setback after demonetisation and GST

 SC-ST act vaala faisla supreme court ne diya tha
 Yes, the government should have brought an ordinance immediately
 kah sakate hai ki isamen der hui
 There would be no misunderstanding if they tackled it properly

 bijepi main sabhi samoohon kaa pratinidhitiv nahin dikhataaramdev ne kaha ki main jatimukt bharat dekhnaa chahta hum, modi ji bhi yahi chaahate hai
 Misconceptions spread among those who remained deprived over the years
 ye bijepi kii vaicharik samasya he yaa pataa nahin kya he ki isamen sabhi samoohon kaa pratinidhitiv nahin he, jaisaa duusare dalon main dikhataa he
 i do not see the representation of a particular class such as tribal or dalit
 jat-dalit-yadav-gujars aadi apana pratinidhitiv kisi chehre main dekhen, aisa nahin dikhataa he
 It was probably a shortage
 kaale dhan par desh ke baahar bhi kadam uthaane kii jaruratramdev ko 2014 se pehle diya unka bayaan ki kaala dhan waapas aa jaae to petrol 30 rupee litre ho jayega, is sawaal par unhone kaha ki ye sach he or maine modi ji se bhi bolaa tha is baat ko
 Petrol-diesel is not as expensive as crude oil it sells
 sarkaar ko isse revanu bahut aata he
 Renew is more than just two things - alcohol and petrol
 sarkaar ko kaam bhi karnaa he, shaayad isliye vah petrol or dijal se hi sari kamai karnaa chaahati he
 The government has worked on the black money inside the country, but strict measures need to be taken on the black money outside the country
 2019 main ekatarfa ladaai nahin, bijepi ko karnaa hoga sangharshramdev ne kaha ki main raajnneetik rup se sarvadaleey or nirdaleey hum

 He said that your program is 'straight talk', but nowadays there is no time to talk directly
 aajkal samay bahut khatarnaak he
 Now even diplomatic cannot talk
 pehle main sochataa tha ki diplomatic baaten nahin kerani chahie
 i traveled around the world and saw that government diplomats are everywhere
 is baat main main diplomatic baat bhi nahin kar saktaa
 If i take one name, the rest will say that we too are doing a good job
 bachapan se aaj tak maine dhara ke vipareet kaam kiyasanyasi hone ke baavjood vyapaar ke sawaal par ramdev ne kaha ki bachapan se maine aaj tak dhara ke vipareet kaam kiya he

 maine vedon kii bhrantiyaan bhi todi ki veda sirf brahman hi padhenge
 i challenged foreign companies
 haalanki mere kaam par kai prashn hue, lekin koi ye nahin kah saktaa ki maine koi galat kaam kiya he
 My opponents also appreciate this
 rojgaar ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki dedh lakh logon ko hamane sidhe rojgaar diya or karodon kisaanon ko phayda pahunchaaya or kisaan putr hone kaa dharm nibhaayaa
 Patanjali's motive is not to make profit
 In 2017-18, the growth of India's large FMCG companies was between 8 and 12 per cent, while Patanjali had no growth, on this question, Ramdev said that our rates are half the rate of these companies

 Patanjali's contribution to the country as a brand will always be increased
 patanjali ke liye desh bazaar nahin parivaar haidesi cheez ko protsaahan dene ke liye ham sim card laae, swadeshi samruddhi card laae
 The government also could not bring such a card
 maine beasenel se koi paisa nahin liya unka prachaar karne kaa
 i am the brand ambassador of Swadeshi
 hamane desh ko bazaar nahin, parivaar maanakar kaam kiya
 Whatsapp's father will be Kimbho Appwatsapp's younger brother Kimbho

 The reason for Lalu's family staying away from the program has been known on Bihar Day
 bihar diwas ke card par apana naam chapa na dekh bihar ke upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ko gussa aa gaya
 He decided not to participate in the program
 jab vah nahin gaye to unke bade bhai or swasthya mantri tej pratap yadav bhi kaarykram main nahin gaye
 On this, Lalu Prasad's daughter and MP Misa Bharti said that if there are many utensils together, then the voice comes
 22 march ko bihar diwas ke udghaatan ke avasar par mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke mantrimandal ke lagbhag sabhi sadsy upasthit the, lekin lalu yadav ke parivaar kaa koi sadsy kaarykram main maujuud tha

 haalanki mahagathbandhan main shaamil jediu congress or argedy is baat kaa joardaar khandan karte rahe ki mahagathmbdhan main koi daraar he
 Both gave different reasons for this

 There should not be such a mistake in this
 gauratlab he ki bihar diwas ke nimantran card menmukhyamantri nitish kumaror shiksha mantri ashok choudhary kaa naam hi chapa tha
 No name was from RJD
 upmukhyamantri ke taur par tejasvi kaa naam to hona hi chahie
 However, it was not given much weight by RJD
 upmukhyamantri tejasvi ne is par pratikriya dene se inkaar kiya to tejpratap yadav ne kaha ki hamane apane parivaar ke saath bihar diwas manaaya, jabaki in donon kii maa or purv mukhyamantri rabari devi ne kaha ki bihar diwas main ham log jaaenge, aaj bhi ja sakate hai
 rjd's Rajya Sabha MP Misa Bharti even said that if a lot of utensils are made simultaneously, then the voice comes

 Therefore, practice writing in advance and you need to have deep knowledge to answer, so that you have content
 aaie jaanate hai is likhit pariksha ke bare main export kya raay dete hai
 
 
 Pushkar Mishra, director of Knowledge First Institute, says that do not always depend on coaching notes for the exam nor use heavy books because the exam is important for you
 uttar likhte samay basic concept ke saath apane vichaaron ko likhen
 NCERT books are good but just reading them is not enough for the main exam
 isliye sirf ensiiarti kii kitabon ke saath saath kuch or kitabon ko padhein taaki vishyon kii behatar samaj viksit ho sake
 Also take care of these things
 
 
 UPSC MAINS EXAM: aise banaaen ranneeti, in baton kaa rakhen dhyaan
 
 
 Write a complete idea: It is important to have more ideas than facts in the content in the essay
 aalekh main sabhi pahalu samahit ho jaaen
 For example, due to lack of industrial development in India, the whole idea will have to be organized while writing on the subject
 behatar karnaa jaruri:ye uniwarsity kii pariksha nahin he ki bachche sirf silebus puraa karke exam de dete hai
 Therefore it is necessary to write better and effective than the other
 acha likhen:sawaalon ke jawaab suchnayukta hone chahie
 There can be three types of leads Information information should be included Effective presentation should be done
 effective tul contint jaise graphics, teble aadi kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 IAS Tina Dabi again did the top, got this special award-winning lead: Impression Lead should give your complete answer in your first line
 pehle vaakya main pataa chal hi jaataa he ki aapako jaankaree he yaa nahin shuruaati ek yaa do line main hi ejaminner ko samaj main aa jaataa he ki use aage padhanaa he yaa nahin
 Hand writing: Hand writing is not bad or good
 isliye yadi aapaki hand riting aapako lagata he acchhee nahin he to baar-baar likhane kii prectis karen
 This will create the correct letter texture and will appear clear
 dhyaan rakhie:likhane main vartanee sambandhi ashuddhiyaan nahin kiijie
 Writing wrong letters in quantities, applying wrong quantities has the wrong effect and gives average numbers only
 jo log 2014 main paper de chuke hai vah bhi nae dhang se apane jawaab likhane kii prectis kiijie

 Kushwaha Kunba has become active for the creation of 'lalbatti' by calling for the Lok Sabha elections
 sukanya ko lalabatti dekar sapa ek tir se do nishane saadh sakati he
 While the 'stigma' of not having a single minister from Bundelkhand will be washed away in the Akhilesh cabinet, this step can also be effective in mobilizing voters from the backward castes like Kachi, Kushwaha, Maurya and Murai communities

 Although this appeal of the Prime Minister is related to the protection of the environment, but it also has political significance

 modi ke jhaadoo uthaate hi puraa sarkari amala abhiyaan main kud padaa
 If we look at the pictures, it is clear that more than just the garbage can be seen
 baad main pradhanmantri ne kai shakhsiyaton ko bhi is abhiyaan se joda
 In the last Delhi Legislative Assembly elections, the Aam Aadmi Party gave slogan - now it will sweep
 is tarah logon ke man main aap kaa simbel baith gaya
 Later, the discussion was even going on that the Prime Minister has hijacked the sweep with AAP
 agar dilli main is baar 'aap' kii aisi jeet na hoti to jhaadoo kaa na jane kya haal hota

 It is generally seen that the Congress has kept a distance from former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao, but the BJP is taking special interest in Rao's memorial in Hyderabad - and then there is an attempt to link Morarji Desai with himself
 congress kaa to khuleam aarope he ki bijepi uske mahapurushon par daavedaari jataane lagi he
 The Prime Minister is fond of new ideas
 jab unhen purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh kaa 'achche din
 
 
 If he liked Slogan, he immediately borrowed it - and made it part of his election campaign
 jhaadoo ko unhone swatchta abhiyaan se to cycle ko paryaavaran abhiyaan se jod diya he
 Like Mayawati it is possible that similar questions should arise in Lalu Yadav's mind that Modi should not connect the lantern with any campaign

 " ol india muslim personal lau board ne musalamaanon se jude kuch muddon ko lekar beete saal november main uttar pradesh kii sabhi badi raajnneetik partiyon ko patr likhaa tha, lekin ravivaar tak use kisi bhi dal kaa jawaab nahin mila he
 Angered by this attitude of political parties, the board has now decided to intensify the campaign among common people on these issues
 chunaav ke is mausam main board jin chaar muddon ko lekar apni muhim chalaa rahaa hai, ve shiksha kaa adhikaar kanoon, vakf sanshodhak vidheyak-2010, pratyaksh kar samhita vidheyak or uttar pradesh jameendaari unmoolan evam bhoomi sudhaar kanoon hai
 Board spokesman Abdul Rahim Qureshi said, 'we had written a letter to all the parties in November last year and put four issues before them
 ab tak hamen kisi kaa javaabi patr nahin mila he
 It is another matter that some leaders and ministers are making promises
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘hamane haal hi main mumbai, andhra pradesh or kai anya jagahon par in muddon par logon ko jagaane ke liye kaarykram kiye the
 Now we will intensify our campaign
 aane vaale samay main uttar pradesh ke kai shaharon main aise kaarykram kiye jaaenge
 The Muslim Personal Law Board, which talks about awakening people on these issues during the election season, says that it will not make a statement in favor or opposition of any party in the assembly elections because it is not a political organization
 muslim personal lau board kii maang thi ki shiksha ke adhikaar kanoon ke daayre se madrason or dharmik shikshan sansthaanon ko mukt kiya jaae or pichley dinon sarkari disha-nirdesh ke jariye dharmik sansthaanon ko is kanoon ke daayre se alag kar bhi diya gaya he
 Now the board says that religious institutions should be excluded from this by amending this law, not government guidelines
 vakf sanshodhan vidheyak ko lekar bhi personal lau board kii kai aapattiyaan rahi hai
 It was passed in the Lok Sabha in the year 2010, but due to objections from Muslim organizations, it was referred to the Select Committee (select Committee) of the Rajya Sabha

 The comments pratyaksh kar samhita vidheyak kaa board yah kehete hue virodh kar rahaa he ki iske kanoon ban jane ke baad sabhi dharmik pratishthan kar ke daayre main aaenge jo bilkul uchit nahin he
 The Board is seeking amendment in the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act-1951, saying that it is not in accordance with the interests of Muslim women
 board kaa kahana he ki is kanoon main sanshodhan kiya janaa chahie taaki shaadi ke baad bhi rajya main muslim mahilaon ko apane maa-baap kii jameen main hissaa mil sake
 Qureshi said, "so far no political party has appeared serious about these issues
 kuch netaaon ne jubaani vaade kiye hai, lekin ham isse santusht nahin hai
 We will continue our campaign
 ’ The four issues on which the board is campaigning during this election season are the Right to Education Act, the Waqf Amendment Bill-2010, the Direct Taxes Code Bill and the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act

 The Muslim Personal Law Board demanded that the Madrasas and religious educational institutions should be freed from the purview of the Right to Education Act and in the past, religious institutions have also been separated from the purview of this law through government guidelines
 ab board kaa kahana he ki sarkari disha-nirdeshon nahin, balki is kanoon main sanshodhan ke jariye dharmik sansthaanon ko isse baahar kiya janaa chahie
 There have also been many objections from the Personal Law Board regarding the Waqf Amendment Bill

 The committee submitted its report in the last session, although the board still says that their objections have not been redressed
 tippaniyan The Board is opposing the Direct Taxes Code Bill, saying that once it becomes law, all religious establishments will come under the tax net, which is not at all fair
 uttar pradesh jamidari unmoolan evam bhoomi sudhaar kanoon-1951 main board yah kehete hue sanshodhan kii maang kar rahaa he ki yah muslim mahilaon ke hiton ke mutabik nahin he
 The board says that this law should be amended so that Muslim women in the state can get a share of their parents' land even after marriage

 In forty years of political life, i have tried to follow the ideals of Gandhi, Lohia, JP and worked for the public interest to the best of my ability
 hamaara yah maananaa he ki aapke vaktavy ne mere vansh par sawaal to uthaaya hi he, saath hi, bihar kii viraasat or bihari asmita ko bhi thes pahunchaai he
 Such statements also reinforce the notion that you and your party are biased towards Biharis
 mujhe aashcharya hota he ki aapke sachet vivek ne in vaktavyon kii gambhirtha ko kaise nahin samajha?atah is patr ke madhyam se meraa aapse yah anurodh he ki aap apane shabdon ko waapas lene par vichaar karen
 i am sure that doing so will bring relief to the hurt feelings of the people
 jisase aapke prati na sirf unka sammaan badhegaa, balki unki najaron main aapkaa kad or bhi unchaa ho jaayegaa

 The Bhupesh Baghel government of Chhattisgarh is taking the fight against Maoists to a rebel stronghold

 narayanpur jile kii orchha tehsil ke abujhmaad main is yojana ko parakhane kii koshishen chal rahi hai
 The 3,905 sq km hilly area, covered with teak and sal trees, is mainly inhabited by the people of the Abuzhmadiya tribe
 iske alaava dadmi maaria, gond or ahir sareekhee duusari janajatiyaan bhi hai
 The only means of movement here is by footpath or mountain climbing
 abujhmaad ko maovadiyon kii maand mana jaataa he kyonki is behad ilaake main aana-janaa dushwaar hone ke chalate yah vidrohi netaaon or cader ke liye surakshit panaahagaah kaa kaam karata he
 Unlike the plains, the settlements in the slum villages are spread rather than nearby
 abujhmaad mushkilon se do-chaar kisi ilaake jaisaa hi he
 On the one hand, the government claims that the villages here do not have access to the inside, but on paper programs like the Prime Minister's Housing and Sanitation Mission are going on
 anusuchit janajati or anya paramparaagat vanavaasi adhinium 2006 (van adhikaron kii manyata) yaa ekaare kii dhara 3 (1) (i) kaa upyog karte hue sarkaar logon ko awaas adhikaar muhaiyaa karne kaa iraadaa rakhti he
 Such rights can be given exclusively to weaker tribal groups (pvtgs)
 chhattisgarh main unamem se paanch janajatiyaan hai—pahari korwa, abujhmadiza, baigaa, qamar or birhor
 Habitat rights not only protect the pvtg's land and livelihood, but also preserve their culture and lifestyle
 ab tak madhya pradesh kii baigaa hi ekmaatr janajati he jisane 2,300 acre kshetra main apana nivas adhikaar praapt kiya he (2015 main)
 Shubhanshu Chaudhary, founder of cgnet Swar, an organization that promotes citizen journalism initiatives in rural areas of the state, says, "the Maoists in Chhattisgarh have been instilling fear among the tribals that the government will chase them away from their soil
" adivaasiyon ko nivas kaa adhikaar dekar sarkaar yah sandesh degi ki uskaa khanan yaa anya vikaas pariyojnaon ke liye adivaasiyon se bhoomi chhinane kaa koi iraadaa nahin
 Chaudhary, along with the Narayanpur administration, is explaining to the Abuzhmadis that what is the proposed residence right of the government? On 23 June, villagers in Narayanpur were called to discuss the subject
 kareeb 100 gramin isamen aae
 But many were also worried that if they show interest in it, they will come under target of Maoists
 choudhary bataate hai, ''maovadi nahin chaahate ki adivasee shiksha, swasthya suvidhaon or khaadya aapurti ke alaava sarkaar se or kuch len
 "in the next meeting, more people were contacted to contact eight pargana majhis in Abujhmad
 maovadiyon kii andekhi karte hue is baithak main shaamil hue gotli pargana ke majhi mangaturam kehete hai, ''bahut-se log is baithak main shaamil nahin hona chaahate kyonki maovadiyon ne unhen sarkaar ke saath najdiki banane se bachane kaa aadesh diya he
 "forest rights laws are different from personal laws relating to people's knowledge of religious practices, traditional medicines, gotras and customs," says forest rights activist Naresh Biswas
 '' biswas ne hi baigaa janajati ko uske nivas adhikaar praapt karne main madad kii thi
 There are 237 villages in Abujhmad, which come under 36 gram panchayats
 teen saal pehle adivasee kalyaan vibhaag ke ek survey main abujhmadiza adivaasiyon kii sankhya 23,076 pai gai thi; pravaasiyon ko shaamil karen to kul aabaadi 40,000 se thodi adhik baithti he
 The Baghel government's stance on separating the local people from Maoism is 'soft' which is different from the 'forward push' policy of the central government, which is moving towards ending the Maoism problem by bringing more and more forces into the area
 is
 iske tahat, kendriya ardhsainik balon or rajya police shiviron ko abujhmaad ke bahari kshetra se hataakar andar ghaney jangalon main sthanantarit karne kii yojana he
 Officials say that this is part of the government's domination policy under which the government wants to close all the escape routes for the Maoists and destroy their safe havens
 haal hi main maowad prabhavit rajyon ke sheersh adhikariyon ke saath centre sarkaar kii ek baithak main chhattisgarh ko abujhmaad main aise shiviron kii sthapana ke liye atirikt kendriya ardhsainik batalian dene kaa faisla hua
 At present, 40 central battalions are stationed in the Maoist strongholds of the state
 baghel ne centre ko aagaah kiya he ki ab tak ''suraksha balon kii aisi aakraamak niti'' kaa koi laabh nahin hua he
 "we should not forget that Maoism has spread from four blocks in the state to 14 districts," he says
 ham civil socity samoohon, maovadi kshetron main sevaayen de chuke surakshakarmiyon or is kshetra main kaam karne vaale duusare hitdharakon ke saath milakar shanti ke prayaas karne ke paksh main hai
 "due to lack of land survey in Abujhmad, it will not be easy to provide the right of migration to the people here
 narayanpur ke colector padum singh alma kehete hai, ''1928-29 or phir 1954-55 main bhoomi bandobasti hui thi par abujhmaad ko chhod diya gaya tha
 Now many areas have become inaccessible or unsafe due to the Maoists' hold in the area
 ''upgrah se liye chitron ke jariye abujhmaad ke survey kaa kaam 2015 main iity-rudki ko saunpa gaya tha
 Due to the opposition of the Abuzhmadis, only 10 villages could be covered
 survey na hua to logon ko jameen par vyaktigat adhikaar nahin die ja sakate
 In Narayanpur district, 4,835 individual claims and 234 community claims have been settled and settled elsewhere but no such claim came from Abujhmad
 chhattisgarh ke mukhya sachiv sunil kumaar kujur bataate hai, ''logon ko nivas adhikaar jari karte samay gaanv kii simaaon ko paribhaashit karnaa hoga
 Until it is not known to which department the land belongs, how can the people be delegated its rights? ”but if this is done then how will things change on the land, seeing that this community has been cultivating the land for centuries
 It has been doing this and the state has never challenged this tradition
 kushannar gaanv ke sudharam kehete hai, ''mere pita or dadaji krishi or van upaj kaa sangrah, donon ke jariye aajeevika jutate the
 Then no one asked us nor does anyone ask us whether the land we use is ours or not
 yahaan kii sari jaminen hamaari hai
 "collector Alma clarifies," The government has never questioned the tribal communities' use of the land of Abujhmad
 to is baat kaa ek praaanpatr jari karnaa, jisamen yah kaha gaya ho ki ham aapako us cheez kaa upyog karne denge jiskaa upyog aap vaise bhi varshon se karte aa rahe hai, pratikatmak mahatv kaa ho saktaa he
 i believe we should go one step further
 bhoomi kaa surveykshan kiya janaa chahie or uskaa malikana haq adivasee logon ko diya janaa chahie taaki maovadiyon ke prapanch ko dhwast kiya ja sake
 "they insist that even the smallest step matters a lot in the fight against Maoism

 The result of not being easy to access here was that the land was never surveyed, the scheme of right of residence under the Forest Rights Act, which is being planned for the tribes, will not only protect their land and livelihood, but their culture And the lifestyle will also be preserved maratha aarakshan kii maang ko lekar 26 saal ke ek yuvak ne maharashtra ke navi mumbai main faansee lagaakar khudakushi kar lee

 The woman works in a private company here
 vah shanivaar kii shaam ko apane dost ke saath sialdah stesan se barrackpore ko jane vaali local train ke ek general dibbe main savaar hui thi
 The victim wrote in her Facebook post that "it was very humid, there was little room to sit, so i urged a middle-aged man to give me some space so we could sit together
" usne inkaar kiya, usne kaha ki vah udhar nahin khisak saktaa kyonki udhar pankhaa nahin he
 According to the victim, he and his friend somehow sat in that little place without any further debate
 iske baad bhi vyakti ne use taana maaraa or kaha ki yah mahila dibba nahin he
 When the couple got up, the person moved to where they had previously refused to go
 iske baad jode ne poocha ki vah ab bina pankhe ke kaise manage karegaa
 This was followed by kaahi-suni, the video of which the woman recorded on her mobile and then shared it on social media
 video main vyakti kahata suna ja rahaa he, "ghar jaao or ek duusare ke god main baitho
 The metro incident (a young couple was beaten up by a mob at Kolkata Metro station's Dum Dum station when a young couple was standing very close in a train compartment in late April) was caused by people of your generation

 aaj (29 agast) hi ke din 1905 main hockey ke jaadugar kahe jane vaale dhyanchand kaa janm hua tha
 His birthday is celebrated as the National Sports Day of India
 isi din har saal khel main utkrisht pradarshan ke liye sarvocch khel sammaan rajeev gandhi khel ratna ke alaava arjuna or dronacharya puraskaar die jate hai
 Dhyanchand's achievements are a long way: The achievements of Dhyanchand, who won India's hockey gold medal in three Olympics (1928 Amsterdam, 1932 Los Angeles and 1936 Berlin), brings glory to Indian sports history
 unke jeevat kaa har koi kaayal rahaa
 a memorable account of his playing life takes Indian hockey to the pinnacle
 berlin alampic ke final kaa wo vakyadarasal, berlin alampic ke hockey kaa final bharat or germany ke bich 14 agast 1936 ko khelaa janaa tha
 But due to continuous rain that day, the match was played the next day on 15 August
 berlin ke hockey stadium main us din 40 hajaar darshakon ke bich hitler bhi maujuud the
 By half time India were ahead by one goal
 iske baad dhyanchand ne apane spike vaale juute nikaale or khaali paanv kamaal kii hockey kheli
 After this, India scored several goals in succession
 saathi daara ne ek sansmaran main aisa likhaa -1936 ke berlin olympic main unke saath khele or baad main pakistan ke captain bane ienes daara ne ek sansmaran main likhaa- chah gol khaane ke baad german kaaphi kharaab hockey khilne lage
 His goalkeeper Tito Warnholtz's hockey stick hit Dhyanchand's mouth so hard that he broke his tooth
 german team ko aise sikhaaya sabakpraarambhik upachaar ke baad ground par lautne ke baad dhyanchand ne khilaadiyon ko nirdesh die ki ab koi gol na maaraa jaae, german khilaadiyon ko ye bataaya jaae ki gend par niyantran kaise kiya jaataa he
 After this, the players would repeatedly take the ball to Germany's d and then pass the ball back
 german khilaadiyon kii samaj main hi nahin aa rahaa tha ki ye ho kya rahaa he
 
 
 
 us haar kaa badla chukayabharat ne us final main germany ko 8-1 se maat di
 Dhyanchand scored three goals in this
 darasal, 1936 ke olympic khel shuru hone se pehle ek abhyaas match main bhartiya team germany se 4-1 se haar gai thi
 Dhyanchand wrote in his autobiography 'gol', 'I will never forget this defeat till i live
 is haar ne hamen itnaa hilaa kar rakh diya ki ham puri raat so nahin paae
 Hitler also bluntly said, Happy in India, it is said that happy with this great performance, Hitler invited him to eat and asked him to play for Germany
 iske badale unhen majboot german sena main karnal pad kaa pralobhan bhi diya
 But Dhyanchand said, 'hindustan is my homeland and i am happy there
 'facts--chunki dhyaan singh raat main bahut abhyaas karte the, isliye unhen apane saathi khilaadiyon dwaara upnaam 'chand' diya gaya
 Actually, his practice started when the moon came out
 -aapako yah jaanakar hairaani hogi ki major dhyanchand ko bachapan main hockey nahin, kushti se zyada lagaav tha
 -one time he said- If someone asked me which was the best match i played, i would say the 1933 Beton Cup final between Calcutta Customs and Jhansi Heroes
 -bharat ne 1932 ke olympic ke dauraan america ko 24-1 or japan ko 11-1 se haraaya
 Dhyanchand scored 12 of those 35 goals, while his brother Roop Singh scored 13 goals
 isse unhen 'hockey kaa judawaan' kaha gaya
 - Once Dhyanchand could not score goals during a match, he objected to the goal post measurement
 aakhirkaar ve sahi paae gaye
 The goal post was not of the official minimum width prescribed under international regulations
 -22 saal tak bharat ke liye khele or 400 international gol kiye
 It is said that when he used to play, it was as if the ball was stuck on the stick
 holland main ek match ke dauraan chumbak hone kii ashanka main unki stick todakar dekhi gai
 During a match in Japan, his stick was also said to have glue
 -dhyanchand kaa 3 disambar, 1979 ko dilli main nidhan ho gaya
 He was cremated in Jhansi on the same ground where he used to play hockey
 smartphone ke saath-saath bhartiya tech bazaar main smart tivi kaa bhi chalan teji se bad gaya he
 Many companies are focusing on removing their TV models
 kuch tivi companiyon kii baat karen to samsung, soni, alji jaise puraane diggajon ke alaava shaomi, vu or thomson jaisi companiyaan bazaar main apane tivi modelon ke saath uplabdh hai
 The most important thing among them is that now the competition in the market is not limited to just taking down the TV but also to make them smart
 ab flats tivi kaa bhi jamaana nahin rahaa balki karvd screen main bhi logo kii dilchaspee bad rahi he
 Previously companies like Samsung and LG brought curved tvs but they cost more
 in sab ke bich mitashi ne karvd tivi segment main apni aajamaaish kii or apana 123
 Launched 19 cm Ultra HD 4K Smart Curved LED TV (mice050v34 4KS)
 isaki keemat bhi kam rakhi gai
 The company had priced it at Rs 37,990
 hamane is tivi ko istemaal kar dekha he or ab ham iskaa rivyuu aap tak pahunchaa rahe hai
 Design, Specifications and Connectivity: The TV we reviewed is 49-inch
 is tivi ke dizin kii baat karen to iske front main yahaan samsung kaa panel yuj kiya gaya he
 You will not get to see too many bezels in this TV
 front panel main kisi tarah kii koi bhi settings ke liye batan nahin die gaye hai
 All the buttons are given on the left side in the back panel
 vahiin saare ports bhi die gaye hai
 In the display of this TV, you will get a resolution of 3860 x 2160 pixels with a 60hz refresh rate
 disple swaabhaavik taur par karvd he
 Its look is quite premium in terms of price
 oparating system kii baat karen to ye thodaa purana he
 Android 4 here
 4 kitcat diya gaya he
 Also here you get 1GB RAM with 8GB internal memory dual-core 1
 2ghz Cortex A7 procesar milegaa
 In terms of connectivity, here 2HDMI port, 2USB port, audio ports, 3
 5mm headphone jaik, VGA input or LAN port milegaa
 In addition, users will also get the option of USB ports, microsd support, built-in wi-fi and screen mirroring
 yani connactivity ke liye bhi paryaapt opshan graahakon ke paas uplabdh rahenge
 Apart from this, you will also get a wall mount in addition to the TV stand for better setup on the table here
 remote kii baat karen to plastic body ke saath fine rabar ke batan se las ye remote oparate karne main kaaphi smood he
 However, due to the absence of Air Mouse in this model, you will feel the need for QWERTY keyboards while using many apps or while playing youtube
 haalanki iske liye yahaan Agile remote ap kii bhi madad le sakate hai, haalanki iske liye aapako smartphone main IR blaster kaa hona jaruri he
 Only then this app will support
 interphes or parformens:interphes kii baat karen to is tivi kaa interphes kaaphi simple he
 That is, you will get all the settings and apps in one scroll
 yahaan aapako fasebuk, utyub or skip jaise ap pehle install hue milenge
 Along with the rest of the app, you will also get Google Play Store
 haalanki purana android varjan hone kii vajah se aapako yahaan saare eps kaa saport nahin milegaa
 One of the problems here is that the most used apps like youtube have not been customized for TV
 isliye iske oparation main thodi bahut dikkat aati he
 Sometimes it even crashes badly
 oparating system ko apadet karne kii sakht jarurat he
 Talking about performance, this TV does not take much time to start, which is a good thing
 wireles connactivity kii baat karen to wi-fi se ek baar conect ho jane ke baad ye tivi on hote hi auto conect ho jaataa he, wo bhi bina zyada samay liye ye bhi ek acchhee baat he
 On the other hand, many operations are very slow due to the old Android version, less RAM and not too fast processor
 lekin aap keemat ke hisaab se ise zyada bura nahin kah sakate
 Talking about the option of screen mirroring, it is not very smooth
 video plabac main kaaphi dikkat hoti he
 Now talk about the features of its panel and curved in the true sense, its panel may not be able to feel like Samsung's expensive curved TV, but it is definitely that you will adjust it according to the price
 HD ho yaa 4K content, colors aapako zyada niraash nahin karenge
 All colors will give you the perfect feel, as well as the contrast will look good
 haalanki kuch-kuch jagahon par aap tone ko soft feel kar sakate hai
 Now, when i talk about the curved feel of TV, i do not think that Curved TV really has any big benefits
 yani main karvd tivi ko nakaar nahin rahaa hum iskaa panel vaaki acha feel detaa he lekin itnaa bhi nahin ki dekhne kaa koi alag diamension hi mil jaae, yaa aap sirf karvd panel hone kii vajah se isaki jagah koi parfect flats panel chhod den
 That is, it is a feature that is good to have, but you can hardly say 'wow'
 baaki regular LED se behatar vyuu aapako jarur milegaa
 Also, this price panel will also give you fun
 baat karen isaki audio quality kii to ye part mujhe is tivi kaa sabase khaas laga kyonki aamtaur par flats or slik hote tivi modelon main audio quality ek samasya ho gai he
 Especially the base key
 to is tivi main bhi aap koi khaas base kaa output nahin feel kar paaenge, lekin aapako behatar laudnes milegi
 Which you will also like overall
 faisla:agar aap kam bajet main koi karvd smart tivi khareednaa chaahate hai to is par paisa laga sakate hai
 Because its picture quality is better and at this price you get a lot of connectivity options and features
 sound quality bhi ek aisi cheez jo ise or bhi khaas banaati he
 However, there are some drawbacks like having an old operating system which can be ignored in terms of price

 The picture is claimed to be that of a man committing suicide by jumping from the Burj Khalifa in Dubai
 india today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne apni padtaal main paaya ki tasviir ke saath kiya ja rahaa daawa jhootha he

 There is an extraordinary difference between the tower and the man as can be seen in the viral picture
 agar koi aadmi kisi tower se kudata he to tower or aadmi ke bich itnaa antar nahin ho saktaa
 In addition, the size of the man falling from the tower is comparatively large
 hamane egypt ke kairo tower se aatmahatya se sambandhit kii vards kii madad se google search kiya to hamane paaya kisiniddle East monitormem 2 disambar, 2019 ko ek report chhapi he
 According to this report, 20-year-old Nader Mohammed, who was suffering from a psychological problem, jumped from the Cairo Tower
 nader ne apane ek dost se kaha tha ki vah aatmahatya karnaa chahta he
 However, there is no such picture of Nader Mohammed jumping from the tower with the report

 During the visit of US President Barack Obama to India on Republic Day, the suit written by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his own name gave the Congress a big opportunity
 rahul gandhi ne aarope lagaaya ki ye kisaan virdohi or suut-boot kii sarkaar he
 The BJP came on the defensive and the entire opposition became aggressive
 bijepi ko dikkatein ghaki ke andar se bhi thim
 Many mps of up-bihar have conveyed to the party high command that the government is being perceived as being anti-farmer on the land acquisition bill
 unka kahana tha ki isse vidhansabha chunaavon main party ko dikkat aa sakati he
 At the same time, voices started raising within the Sangh Parivar as well
 bhartiya kisaan sangh, bhartiya majdoor sangh or swadeshi jaagran manch jaise sanghathanon ne bhi endie ke bill kaa virodh karnaa shuru kar diya
 Allied parties like the Akali Dal and Shiv Sena also went against it

 bangaloru main rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main baqayada prajentation diya gaya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi too defended the bill in his monthly radio broadcast 'mann Ki Baat'

 He understood that the government was coming under pressure
 rajya sabha main apni baari sankhya kaa istemaal karte hue congress kai anya partiyon ko bhi saath lene main kaamyaab rahi
 The most dramatic event took place on August 3 when the government itself decided to withdraw the controversial amendments at a joint committee meeting

 is kadam se vipaksh ke haath se ek bada mudda to chhin hi gaya he bijepi bhi ab ye kah rahi he ki sarkaar kisaanon ke hiton main faisle karti he

 But the government has decided that whichever states will make laws and send them, the Center will get them approved by the President

 Finally, it can be said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has introduced a flexible approach, not making the land acquisition bill a question of prestige

 sarkaar sabase pehle sanyukt samiti ke gathan ke liye taiyaar hui
 Rural Development Minister Chaudhary Virender Singh has repeatedly spoken of bringing amendments in the interests of farmers and this has been done
 iske baavjood congress tus se mas nahin hui
 She insisted that the UPA law be restored
 use ye samaj main aa gaya ki sarkaar dabaav main aa rahi he
 Using its large numbers in the Rajya Sabha, the Congress managed to take many other parties along
 sabase naatakeey ghatnakram teen agast ko hua jab sanyukt samiti kii baithak main sarkaar ne khud hi vivaadaaspad sanshodhano ko waapas lene kaa faisla kiya
 These may appear to be the defeat of the government, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has very cleverly taken a big political decision
 unhone adhyadesh dobaaraa jari na karne kaa faisla kar behad mahatvapurn bihar vidhansabha chunaavon se thik pehle party ko bhoomi adhigrahan ke khud ke banaae jaal se baahar nikaalane kii koshish kii he
 With this step, the opposition has already lost a big issue, BJP is also now saying that the government takes decisions in the interests of farmers
 duusari mahatvapurn baat ye he ki sarkaar ne adhigrahan ke liye rajya sarkaron ko kanoon banane kaa adhikaar dene kaa faisla kiya he
 Since land acquisition is in the concurrent list, the laws of the Center would dominate the laws of the states
 magar sarkaar kaa faisla he ki jo bhi rajya kanoon bana kar bhejenge, centre unhen raashtrapati se manjuuri dilavaayegi
 The thinking behind this is that the bjp-ruled states should go ahead on the basis of the proposed law of the NDA and do something on the ground in the next three years, so that those Congress-ruled states who want to follow the path of upa's tricky land acquisition law They can be compared
 tippaniyan The third point is also that the government has adopted a path to issue executive orders to include thirteen laws
 isse ek nai bahes chhid jaaegi ki kya sarkaar sansad ko darkinar karnaa chaahati he
 But it is also a message to the industrial world that the government has more constitutional avenues for speeding up economic reforms and development if the bill is not passed due to the deadlock in Parliament
 aakhir main yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhoomi adhigrahan bill ko pratishtha kaa prashn nahin banaate hue ek lacheele rukh kaa parichay diya he
 This is also a message to his critics who say that Modi does not listen to anyone
 bhoomi adhigrahan bill par unhone sabaki sun kar hi aisa faisla kiya jo chaahe fori taur par sarkaar kii chhavi ko thes pahunchaata ho magar raajnneetik rup se bijepi ke liye phydemand hi rahegaa
 Using its large numbers in the Rajya Sabha, the Congress managed to take many other parties along

 tippaniyan The third point is also that the government has adopted a path to issue executive orders to include thirteen laws
 isse ek nai bahes chhid jaaegi ki kya sarkaar sansad ko darkinar karnaa chaahati he
 But it is also a message to the industrial world that the government has more constitutional avenues for speeding up economic reforms and development if the bill is not passed due to the deadlock in Parliament
 aakhir main yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhoomi adhigrahan bill ko pratishtha kaa prashn nahin banaate hue ek lacheele rukh kaa parichay diya he
 This is also a message to his critics who say that Modi does not listen to anyone
 bhoomi adhigrahan bill par unhone sabaki sun kar hi aisa faisla kiya jo chaahe fori taur par sarkaar kii chhavi ko thes pahunchaata ho magar raajnneetik rup se bijepi ke liye phydemand hi rahegaa
 These may appear to be the defeat of the government, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has very cleverly taken a big political decision
 unhone adhyadesh dobaaraa jari na karne kaa faisla kar behad mahatvapurn bihar vidhansabha chunaavon se thik pehle party ko bhoomi adhigrahan ke khud ke banaae jaal se baahar nikaalane kii koshish kii he
 With this step, the opposition has already lost a big issue, BJP is also now saying that the government takes decisions in the interests of farmers
 duusari mahatvapurn baat ye he ki sarkaar ne adhigrahan ke liye rajya sarkaron ko kanoon banane kaa adhikaar dene kaa faisla kiya he
 Since land acquisition is in the concurrent list, the laws of the Center would dominate the laws of the states
 magar sarkaar kaa faisla he ki jo bhi rajya kanoon bana kar bhejenge, centre unhen raashtrapati se manjuuri dilavaayegi
 The thinking behind this is that the bjp-ruled states should go ahead on the basis of the proposed law of the NDA and do something on the ground in the next three years, so that those Congress-ruled states who want to follow the path of upa's tricky land acquisition law They can be compared
 tippaniyan The third point is also that the government has adopted a path to issue executive orders to include thirteen laws
 isse ek nai bahes chhid jaaegi ki kya sarkaar sansad ko darkinar karnaa chaahati he
 But it is also a message to the industrial world that the government has more constitutional avenues for speeding up economic reforms and development if the bill is not passed due to the deadlock in Parliament
 aakhir main yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhoomi adhigrahan bill ko pratishtha kaa prashn nahin banaate hue ek lacheele rukh kaa parichay diya he
 This is also a message to his critics who say that Modi does not listen to anyone
 bhoomi adhigrahan bill par unhone sabaki sun kar hi aisa faisla kiya jo chaahe fori taur par sarkaar kii chhavi ko thes pahunchaata ho magar raajnneetik rup se bijepi ke liye phydemand hi rahegaa
 Another important thing is that the government has decided to give the right to the state governments to make laws for the acquisition
 chunki bhoomi-adhigrahan samavarti suchi main he isliye rajyon ke kanoonon par centre kaa kanoon haaavee hota
 But the government has decided that whichever states will make laws and send them, the Center will get them approved by the President
 iske peeche soch ye he ki bijepi shasit rajya endie ke prastaavit kanoon ke aadhaar par hi aage badhen or agle teen saal main jameen par kuch karke dikhaaya jaae, taaki wo congress shasit rajya jo upie ke pechida bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon ke raste par chalanaa chaahate hai unase unki tulana kii ja sake
 The comments teesri baat ye bhi he ki sarkaar ne teraa kanoonon ko shaamil karne ke liye kaaryakari aadesh jari karne kaa rasta apanaaya he
 This will spark a new debate whether the government wants to sideline Parliament
 magar ye audyogic jagat ko ek sandesh bhi he ki sansad main gatirodh ke chalate bill paas na hone par sarkaar ke paas aarthik sudhaaron or vikaas ko raftaar dene ke liye or bhi sanvaidhanik raste maujuud hai
 Finally, it can be said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has introduced a flexible approach, not making the land acquisition bill a question of prestige
 ye unke aalochakon ko bhi sandesh he jo kehete hai ki modi kisi kii nahin sunate
 He took a decision on land acquisition bill after listening to everyone, which hurts the image of the government on an immediate basis but will be politically beneficial for the BJP

 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi has given a statement in the Muzaffarpur girl child case
 unhone kaha ki police puri mustaidi se karrwai kar rahi thi
 Out of the 11 accused, 10 have been arrested
 magar vipaksh is maamle main bhram failaa rahaa tha, isliye mukhyamantri ne sibiai jaanch kii anushansa kar yah spasht kar diya he ki sarkaar kii manshaa kisi ko bachaane or fansaane kii nahin he
 The BJP leader said that on the next date of hearing of this case, the government will urge the High Court to monitor the CBI investigation itself
 bataa den ki pratipaksh ke netaa tejasvi yadav ne isaki jaanch hoicourt kii nigaraanee main sibiai se karaane kii maang kii thi
 Modi said that the trust of the Lalu family has increased on the CBI and it is a matter of happiness
 unhone kaha ki sibiai ko gaali dene vaala lalu parivaar ab railway tender ghotaale main karrwai hone par you turn nahin legaa
 Modi rejected Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha's statement in which he said that before 2020, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar should give up politics and give opportunity to someone else
 modi ne kaha ki endie ke ek ghatak dal kii ore se 2020 ke vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar die gaye bayaan se bijepi sahamat nahin he
 Modi said these things in Bihar Legislative Council
