 It is not even 12 hours since the meeting of US President Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong and the two have changed their attitude towards each other
 singapore main shikhar vaarta ke baad trump ne kim ko na sirf pratibhashali kaha, balki ye bhi kaha ki unase meraa behad khaas judaav ban gaya he
 Trump's such remarks about Kim could hardly have been thought of a few months ago
 kuch samay pehle tak donon netaa ek-duusare ko na sirf dhamkiyaan dete the, balki ek-duusare kaa apmaan bhi karte the
 Last year, when the North Koreans test-fired several nuclear and ballistic missiles, defying the international community, a verbal war broke out between the two leaders
 may 2017 main trump ne kim ko ‘parmaanu hathiyaaron se las pagal aadmi’ qaraar dete hue kaha tha ki unhen kuch bhi karne kii ijaajat nahin di ja sakati
 The following month, the US banned people and institutions associated with North Korea's nuclear and missile programs
 july 2017 main uttar korea ne japan sagar main lambii duuri kii missile kaa pareekshan kiya tha
 Some experts had said about this missile that it is capable of reaching Alaska in the US

 In his first address to the United Nations General Assembly in September last year, President Trump threatened to "completely destroy North Korea
" ’trump ke is bayaan par kadi pratikriya jaahir karte huekimane america raashtrapati ke vyavhaar ko ‘maansik taur par veikshipt’ jaisaa qaraar diya tha or jor dekar kaha tha ki ‘daraa hua kutta zyada jor se bhunkata he
 In November, President Trump officially declared North Korea a sponsor of terrorism
 trump ne kim ko ‘little rocket main’ bhi kaha tha or uttar korea par aisa hamalaa karne kii dhamkee di thi jaisaa duniya main kabhi kisi ne nahin dekha hoga
 In response, Kim alleged that Trump was 'mentally deranged' and 'stubborn'
 uttar korea ne prashanth mahaasaagar sthit america kshetra guam par hamalaa karne kii bhi dhamkee di thi
 In Singapore, Kim pointed to the enmity between North Korea and the US and said it was not easy to reach here

 Bangladesh lost by five runs to Zimbabwe in the third one-day international cricket match despite wicket-keeper batsman Mushfiqur Rahim's century
 zimbabwe ne is tarah se paanch maichon kii siries main 3-0 kii ajey badhat banaai
 Zimbabwe scored 250 for seven with the help of a 142-run partnership for the third wicket between Tatanda Taibu (83) and Hamilton Maskadza (74) after being invited to bat first
 bangladesh ne niyamit antaraal main wicket ganvaae lekin mushafikar ne ek chor se morcha sanbhale rakhaa

 2 over main 245 ran par simat gai
 Mushfiqur took the match to a thrilling turn but his four wickets in 13 balls did not fulfill his intention to give Bangladesh their first win in this tour
 bangladesh ko antim teen over main 22 ran chahie the lekin usne 47wein over main chah ran banaae or nasir hossain kaa wicket ganvaaya
 In the next over from Kyle Jarvis, Mushfiqur hit a six but Shafiul Islam and Rubel Hossain returned to the pavilion from the other end

 a similar thing happens in the film Idiocha released today

 Meaning, it seems that we have seen this many times before
 ab is film main kyon dikhaa rahe hai
 It does not seem that idiots have been written by the same Habib Faizal, whom we remember for Do Dooni Char and Ishaqzaade
 film kii kahani bahut zyada pridictible he
 Rishi Kapoor has a very good acting
 ayushmaan khurana kii acchhee acting he, magar is range ko vah pehle hi saadh chuke hai
 And Sonam
 unki zukam main dabi aawaaj or andaaj dekhakar yahi lagata he ki vah kisi fishan magazine main kaam karen to donon ke liye acha rahegaa
 His and ours
 film bevakoofiyaan ausat film he
 It has some good dialogues
 kuch acchhee acting he or so so kahani he

 Put him on probation and start investigating
 beti ko bataane lagate hai ki life main pyaar nahin paisa jaruri he
 Well, Mohit passes by Sehgal's examinations, but then Rishen hits and his job goes away
 phir jhooth or aapasi shikawa shikayaton kaa daur shuru hota he
 Confusion occurs, Iago collides
 aakhir main jo papa unke pyaar ke dushman the, vahi unhen ek hone main madad karte hai
 Did notice anything more, it is a matter of time
 yahi rishi kapur heroin ke baap ko koskar gaate the, taiyab ali pyaar ke dushman hai hai
 And today he remained an enemy of love
 acting main hi mumkin he
 Wearing new character snakeskin
 or apni is nai kentul main rishi kapur gadar rang dha rahe hai
 Be it pure desi romance or Do Dooni Char and this film
 aisa lagata he ki charbi ke saath unki kutanes bhi badhati ja rahi he
 Another good thing about the film is its pace
 do ghante se bhi kam main khatm ho jaati he, isliye kahin bhi susti yaa boriyat nahin chaati
 But what to do about Sonam, who is playing all the stars in the same tune
 unke kariyar main ye film kya sirf bikni seen kii vajah se hi yaad kii jaaegi
 i doubt that will happen
 film kaa diarection kiya he nupar asthana ne
 He had extinguished one more light and made a soo type film earlier

 vaqeel (priyanka setia) ke puche jane par hasina parkar apane pita (dadhi pandey), bhai daaud (siddhant kapur) or hasband (ankur bhaatia) ke bare main kai baaten bataati he
 During this period, many incidents like Babri Masjid, Hindu Muslim Riots, Mumbai Blast are mentioned
 paariwarik muddon ke saath hi ahm baton kii taraf dhyaan aakarshith kiya jaataa he
 You get to know what the film is all about
 'hasina' kaa nayaa poster relies, burka pahane shraddha kaa jabardast andaajakyon dekh sakate hai film- film kaa diarection or balldrop acha he
 The shooting style of Apoorva Lakhia is a commendable one and the presentation style is amazing
 - kairactor actor ke taur par dadhi pandey ne hasina ke pita kaa kirdaar badhiya nibhaayaa he vahiin hasina ke hasband ke role main ankur bhaatia feet rahe hai
 At the time of the arrest, Dawood's brother Kaskar was eating Biryani at the house of Haseena Parkar - the background score of the film has been given by Amar Mohile which suits the whole story
 agar shraddha kapur ke bahut bade fain hai to film ek baar dekh sakate hai
 Weak Links - The story of the film and the screenplay in particular is very weak, due to which one gets bored after a time
 - film kii casting bhi kaaphi kamjor he, jahaan ek taraf shraddha kapur kahin thik lagati hai to kahin kirdaar ke saath nyaay nahin kar paati hai
 As Siddhanth Kapoor, we have seen the weakest underworld don, the film would have looked better if more efforts were done on it
 - film kaa second half kamjor lagata he
 The courtroom drama in the film makes one laugh a number of times
 - film kii editing or durust kii ja sakati thi
 The songs of the film are also nothing special
 box offistlaak ke baad apni 'garlfriend' shraddha ke saath film karenge farhaan akhtarproduction cost or promoshan ko milakar film kaa bajet lagbhag 30-35 karod bataaya ja rahaa he
 If the word of mouth and collection of the film is correct till the weekend, then the screens can be extended next week

 In its report tabled in Parliament in August 2010, the CAG raised serious questions on the 'supply chain management' of rice, lentils, sugar, tea, oil, fruits and milk etc
 for the civilians
 isamen kaha gaya tha ki sena kii uttari kaman main tainaat teen lakh sainikon ko rashan kii anumaanit storage avadhi ke baad isaki supplai kii gai
 In addition, the quantity, quality and taste are not satisfactory for the food soldiers in all three cases
 isliye kharaab rashan muhaiyaa karaane vaale pratishthanon ko kaali suchi main daalane se lekar puri prakriya main parivartan kii zarurat he
 In the supply of expired rations, in 2016, the CAG said almost the same things in its report tabled in Parliament
 sieji ne kaha tha ki jammu-kashmir ke oparational ilaakon main tainaat sainikon ko expyri date ke baad rashan kii supplai kii gai

 According to the CAG, the army's procurement of ration in the northern, western and southern command is non-competitive, so this ration is not only poor in quality but also high in cost

 The army personnel are given 2000 calories every day

 The ongoing DNA dispute between Prime Minister Modi and Nitish Kumar has now become part of the election campaign
 nitish kumaar ke chunavi prachaar ke ek aise hi radio vigyaapan main modi par tanj kasate hue kaha gaya, 'bihar ke diene ko tum kya jaano jumala babu'
 In his new campaign of Nitish Kumar Radio and FM, he is not only engaged in politically encircling Modi on the statement of DNA, but in the film dialogue by presenting rhyme of DNA and making it sharper and presenting it to the public

 ' ko badalakar modi par tanj kiya ja rahaa he

 Remember that a few days ago, the BJP President had described PM Modi's 'good days are coming' as an election jumla
 nitish kumaar ne apane is rediyon aid campan ko modi kodusri parivartan ralike thik ek din pehle launch kiya he, taaki modi ke bihar yatra ke pehle isaki charchaa joro par ho jaae
 Although the BJP has already run its ad camp on the radio, but Nitish attacks Modi on radis in a new way which can directly hit the BJP

 After spending hard earned money on precious jewelery, it is necessary to keep them properly and take care of them
 jab aap asli moti ke aabhushan kharidti hai to use malamal ke kapade main lapetakar rakhana na bhoolen
 Waiting for 'kishan Das & Company' from Hyderabad, Kishan Das and jewelery designer Pooja Vaswani have given these suggestions regarding the care of delicate jewelery: 1
 kabhi bhi aabhushan par sidhe parafum spray nahin karen
 2
 kundan (ankat diamond) aabhushan ko sponge yaa coton lage plastic box main rakhe jane kii jarurat hoti he, kyonki anya rasayanon ke sampark main aakar ye kaale pad sakate hai
 3
 panna bahut naram va najuk pathar hota he
 Wear only emerald jewelery so that there is no possibility of falling and breaking them
 4
 Basra (real) pearl should be wrapped in muslin cloth
 garmiyon main inhen pahanane se bachein, kyonki paseene ke sampark main aakar ye apni chamak kho sakate hai
 5
 aabhushanon ko multiple khaanche vaale box main rakhen yaa alag-alag box main rakhen, kyonki ek saath rakhane par scrtch pad saktaa he yaa aapas main ulajhakar inke tuutane kii bhi sambhaavna rahati he
 6
 heere ke sivaay anya kisi aabhushan ko sabun yaa pani se saaf nahin karen
 7
 aabhushan par se daag-dhabbe hataane ke liye aap irager kaa istemaal kar sakati hai
 'I began to doubt my husband from that day'8
 niyamit antaraal par aabhushan saaf karte rahen
 This will keep them clean, shiny and always new
 sabhi aabhushan yaa pathar ek hi tareeke se saaf nahin karne chahie
 9
 sona ek najuk dhaatu he or is par kharonch aasaani se pad sakati hai
 Try to protect it from scratches and keep consulting your jeweler for proper polishing and maintenance
 shaadi karne se kam ho saktaa he depressant10
 Avoid wearing soft and delicate jewelery while cooking, exercising, swimming or doing any household chores
 saath hi tej garmi yaa roshni main ratna pahanane se bachein, kyonki iskaa rang ud jaataa he or yah rangahin ho jaataa he
 11
 aabhushan ko kisi tarah kaa nuksaan pahunchane se bachaane ke liye mechap karne, loshan, parafum laga lene ke baad hi inhen pahanen

 Sources say that Advani has told the leaders who have come to meet him that Narendra Modi is not right for the leadership of the country
 unhone kaha ki is tarah kii khabaren niraadhaar hai
 Rajnath said, "I want to make one thing clear that there is news on some news channels that the RSS has said this or that
 main puri tarah spasht karnaa chahta hum ki sangh ne kuch nahin kaha he
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘maine sangh main logon se pataa kiya he, kya unhone koi bayaan diya he
 They told me that no statement has been made on their behalf, all these reports are completely baseless
 ’’ Media reports had earlier claimed that the issue was discussed between RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and Rajnath Singh
 sutron ne bataaya ki bhaajapa or aresas donon kaa yah mat tha ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko chunaav abhiyaan samiti ke pramukh ke rup main niyukt kiye jane ke faisle se peeche nahin hataa janaa chahie
 However, he believed that Advani should be given due respect and all efforts should be made to persuade him to withdraw his resignation
 adwani kii vaapasi kii sambhaavnaaon ke prashn par rajnath singh ne koi jawaab nahin diya or phir vah aaj rajasthan ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye
 bjp's parliamentary board has rejected the resignation of Lal Krishna Advani
 iske saath-saath unhen manaane ke prayaas lagaataar jari hai
 Earlier, on Monday, a day after the conclusion of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) National Executive meeting in Goa, the party created a furore after the party's leader LK Advani resigned from all posts
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke unnayan virdohi adwani ne aarope lagaaya he ki party ke adhikansh netaa sirf apane nijee agenda ko tarjeeh de rahe hai
 Narendra Modi was appointed as the chairman of the bjp's campaign committee for the general election on Sunday, the last day of the bjp's national executive meeting in Goa
 adwani kaa apratyaashit faisla yadi nahin badalata he to iskaa sidhaa sa matlab modi ko 2014 ke aam chunaav main pradhanmantri pad kaa pratyaashee ke rup main manjuuri pradaan kiya janaa hoga
 Senior leaders of BJP stayed at Advani's residence to convince Advani in the events that went on till the evening
 party ke bheetar foot saarvajanik hone se ghabaraai bhaajapa ne aanan fanan main apni sansadeey board kii baithak bulaai
 The Parliamentary Board is one of the three top bodies of the party
 do anya nikaay rashtriya kaaryakarini or chunaav samiti hai
 Modi from Gujarat urged Advani to withdraw his resignation and appealed to his leader not to disappoint the lakhs of party workers
 1980 ke dashak main bhaajapa ke gathan se lekar ise raajnneetik rup se sabal banane vaale or party ko dhur hinduvadi vichaardhaara dene vaale adwani modi kaa unnayan karne se rokane main kaamyaab nahin ho sake
 To express his opposition, he resigned from the National Executive, Parliamentary Board and Election Committee
 adwani ne party adhyaksh rajnath singh ko ek naaraazgi bharaa patr likhaa he
 There is no mention of Modi anywhere in the three-foot letter, but it is clear from its tone that the resignation is linked to Modi's height in the party's Goa meeting on Sunday
 adwani ne kaha he, "kuch samay se main party ke maujuuda kaamkaaj se or jis disha main party ja rahi he, usase talmail bithaane main kathinaayee mahasoos kar rahaa hum
 " adwani ne kaha he ki ab "kisi ke man main yah bhaavana nahin rah gai he ki yah vahi adarshavaadi party he, jise shyama prasad mukherjee, pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay, nanaaji deshmukh or atal bihari vaajapeyi ne khadaa kiya tha, jinaki ek maatr chintaa desh or desh kii janata ko lekar thi
 " adwani ne patr main likhaa he, "hamaare adhikansh netaa ab maatr apane nijee agenda ko lekar chintit hai
 "in this way, Advani has so far criticized the BJP leaders, and this has brought out the internal infighting of the party
 adwani ne aage likhaa he, "isliye maine party ke teen pramukh padon - rashtriya kaaryakarini, sansadeey board or chunaav samiti se istipha dene kaa nirnay liya he
 This can be considered my resignation
 " adwani ab sirf bhaajapa ke sadsy bhar rah gaye hai
 BJP is stunned by Advani's resignation
 adhikansh netaa, jo somvaar subah tak modi ke unnayan ke khumaar main the, unhone shuru main is par koi pratikriya dene se inkaar kar diya
 bjp's ideological parent organization, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), described the incident as extremely unfortunate
 istipha milane ke ek ghante ke andar bhaajapa ne kaha ki adwani ko manaane kii koshish kii jaaegi
 Rajnath Singh tweeted that he has not accepted Advani's resignation
 rajg ke ghatak dal, janata dal-united (jadyu) ke adhyaksh sharad yadav ne kaha, "yah dukhad he
 
 yah rajg ke liye acha nahin he
 " goa se bhaajapa saansad shripad nike ne kaha, "yah vaaki main durbhagyapurna he
 "BJP leader Sushma Swaraj said that the party was confident that she could ask Advani to withdraw her resignation
 bhaajapa main chhide grihayuddh se congress khush najar ai
 Congress general secretary Janardan Dwivedi said, "BJP has to think on this
 sambandhit vyakti ko sochna he
 We had already said that this (modi's upgrade) will have its own consequences
 "tippaniyan Advani joined the RSS in 1947 and joined the Jana Sangh when it was founded in 1951
 1986 main unhone bhaajapa ke adhyaksh pad kii kaman tab sanbhali thi jab loksabhaa main iske maatr do saansad the
 Soon after becoming the Speaker, Advani became a strong supporter of the Ram Mandir movement
 isi andolan ne bhaajapa ko aage badhane main madad kii or iske baad yah ek badi party ke rup main ubhari
 He said that such reports are baseless
 rajnath ne kaha, ‘‘main ek cheez spasht kar dena chahta hum ki kuch samachar channelon par khabar chali he ki aresas ne yah kaha he yaa vah kaha he
 i want to make it clear that the Sangh has not said anything
 ’’ He said, "I have found out from the people in the Sangh, have they made any statement
" unhone mujhe bataaya ki unki taraf se koi bayaan nahin diya gaya he, ye sab khabaren puri tarah niraadhaar hai
 '' media kii khabaron main purv main daawa kiya gaya tha ki is mudde par aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat or rajnath singh ke bich charchaa hui he
 Sources said both the BJP and RSS were of the opinion that Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi should not be overtaken by the decision to be appointed as the head of the election campaign committee
 haalanki, unka maananaa tha ki adwani ko uchit sammaan diya janaa chahie or unhen manaane ke sabhi prayaas kiye jane chahie, taaki vah apana istipha waapas le len
 On the question of the possibility of Advani's return, Rajnath Singh did not give any answer and then he left for Rajasthan today
 bijepi ke sansadeey board ne laal krishna adwani ke istife ko naamanzoor kar diya he
 Simultaneously, efforts are on to convince him
 isse pehle, goa main bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak ke samaapan ke thik ek din baad somvaar ko party ke kaddavar netaa laalkrishna adwani ke sabhi padon se istipha dene ke baad party main koharaam much gaya
 Advani, who is opposed to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, has alleged that most of the party leaders are only giving preference to their personal agenda
 goa main bhaajapa kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak ke aakhri din ravivaar ko aam chunaav ke liye bhaajapa kii prachaar samiti ke adhyaksh ke rup main narendra modi ko niyukt kiya gaya tha
 If Advani's unexpected decision does not change, it simply means that Modi will have to be approved as the prime ministerial candidate in the 2014 general election
 shaam tak chale ghatnakram main bhaajapa ke varisht netaa adwani ko manaane ke liye unke awaas par jame rahe
 Fearful of the split within the party, the BJP called its parliamentary board meeting in a hurry
 sansadeey board party kii teen sheersh nikaayon main se ek he
 The two other bodies are the National Executive and the Election Committee
 gujarat se modi ne adwani se apana istipha waapas lene kaa aagrah kiya or apane netaa se party ke lakhon kaaryakartaaon ko niraash nahin karne kii apil kii
 From the formation of the BJP in the 1980s to making it politically strong and giving a strong Hinduist ideology to the party, Advani could not succeed in upgrading Modi
 apana virodh jataane ke liye unhone rashtriya kaaryakarini, sansadeey board or chunaav samiti se hi istipha de diya
 Advani has written an angry letter to party president Rajnath Singh
 teen pare ke patr main modi kaa kahin bhi zikr nahin he, lekin iske swar se spasht he ki party kii goa baithak main ravivaar ko modi kaa kad badaye jane se hi istipha judaa hua he
 Advani has said, "for some time i have been finding it difficult to keep pace with the current functioning of the party and the direction in which the party is going

 Yes, we were in a relationship, but not everything in our lives was the same and right all the time, that's why we parted ways
 or yahi behatar he ki mujhe apni zindagi or romanch ko unki zindagi zeene den
 Sangeeta and Romanche had been in a deep relationship together for almost nine years, and perhaps both of them were going to get married very soon, but nothing happened and both of them moved forward in their lives
 sangeeta aage kahati hai "hamen pataa tha ki baat nahin ban rahi he, or kaaphi samajhadaari ke saath hamane ek duusare kaa saath choda he, jiske liye ham donon ko kisi bhi baat ko lekar koi pareshaani nahin he or ham aaj bhi ek achche dost hai

 Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj told after the meeting that most parties and especially the NDA believe that the government should introduce the Lokpal Bill in the monsoon session of Parliament
 iske baad is vidheyak ko sansad kii sthai samiti main bhej diya jaye, jisamen sabhi dal, rajya sarkaar or samaaj ke sanghathan apni raay de saken
 Sushma said that after this, based on the recommendations of the Standing Committee, the Bill should be introduced again in the Winter Session of Parliament to get it passed

 Singh said that the government is committed to bring Lokpal Bill in the upcoming monsoon session of Parliament but it should not undermine the rational role and authority of other institutions present in our democratic structure
 pradhanmantri ke is bayaan ko anna hazaare paksh ke is rukh ke maddenjar ahm mana ja rahaa he ki pradhanmantri or ucch nyaaypalika ko lokapal ke daayre main aana chahie
 The government believes that by doing so another structure will be created parallel to the government

 Nevertheless, he has played a variety of roles which have often been challenging and through these he has left his mark on the film world

 ''vifaltaaon ke baavjood, saf khud ko bachaae rakhane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 Critics, of course, attribute this to his family — he is the son of famous actress Sharmila Tagore and cricketer Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi — but Saif has consistently chosen a path not many people follow
 unhone hameshaa chunautiyaan sweekaar kii hai or kabhi bhi surakshit formule ke peeche nahin bhaage
 For example, by getting ready for the role of the protagonist in Raj and dk's Happy Ending (2014), Saif showed that he was one of the few actors who tried to understand the essence of 'acting'
 film waisi romantic kamedi par vyangy thi jaisi filmein khan ne kii thim or jinhone unhen lokapriy banaaya tha
 Among such films are Imtiaz Ali's Love Aaj Kal (2009) and Homi Adajania's Cocktail (2012) — considered to be his biggest hits

 However, his Sacred Games are in the shadows right now

 Though Sartaj is committed to the truth, Saif says, "he is not a Bollywood hero
" '' saf kaa maananaa he ki sartaaj vah 'naitik aadhaar' he jo puure sho ko santulit rakhata he
 The fun of Sacred Games actually increases as Sartaj's character becomes brave from clumsy
 saf kehete hai, ''sartaaj aisa vyakti he jo chaalaaki bhare upadeshon main ulajh jaataa he or samasyaon kaa hal dharm, yaa apane guruji (pankaj treepathi) ke ashram main khojane kii koshish karata he

 But Nitish Kumar's mathematics did not work well

 BAADDUUMMB xxrep 4 a film 'krish-3' ho yaa film 'jab tak he jaan', aisi kai filmein diwali ke din hi release hui hai phir wo diwali shuukravaar se 2 din pehle padi ho yaa 3 din pehle
 Films released on the occasion of Diwali are released on the day of Diwali so that the film gets the benefit of long holidays and weekends
 magar salmaan khan kii film 'prem ratan dhan payo' ko diwali ke duusare din release kiya ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, the question arises that why is the film not being released on the day of Diwali but being released on the second day of Diwali? Special sources tell that by releasing 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo' on the second day of Diwali, Salman Khan wants to make the highest grossing film on the first day
 tippaniyan Actually, Shahrukh Khan's film 'happy New Year' is at the forefront with the highest collection of 40 crores on the first day and 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo' wants to set a new record by collecting more than 40 crores on the first day
 sutara bataate hai ki bahut hi soch samajhakar ye nirnay liya gaya he
 On the day of Diwali, people are busy in worshiping and meeting in the evening, so the collection is not big in the evening
 aise main 'prem ratam dhan payo' pehle din record nahin bana sakati
 Therefore, the film is being released on the second day of Diwali so that on this holiday, viewers go to see a large number of films and get a chance to make the film a new record at the box office
 vaise salmaan khan kii film agar diwali jaise tyohaar par release ho rahi he to ummid aisi hi hogi ki koi na koi nayaa record film zarur banaaegi
 But whether Shahrukh's record of 40 crores will be broken or not, it will be known by the second day of Diwali i

 November 12 night
 aise main sawaal ye uthta he ki aisa kyon ho rahaa he ki film diwali ke din release naa hokar diwali ke duusare din release ho rahi he? khaas sutara bataate hai kii diwali ke duusare din 'prem ratan dhan payo' ko release karke salmaan khan pehle din sabase zyaada kamai karne vaali film bananaa chaahate hai
 The comments darasal pehle din sabase zyaada 40 karod kaa kollection kar shahrukh khan kii film 'happy new year' sabase aage he or 'prem ratan dhan payo' pehle din 40 karod se zyaada collection karke nayaa kirtiman sthapit karnaa chaahati he
 Sources reveal that this decision has been taken very thoughtfully
 diwali ke din shaam main log puja or milane julne main vyast rahete hai isliye shaam main collection bada nahin hota
 In such a situation, 'prem Ratam Dhan Payo' cannot make a record on the first day
 isliye diwali ke duusare din yah film release kii ja rahi he taaki is chuttee ke din darshak baari sankhya main film dekhne jaaen or box offis par is film ko nayaa kirtiman banane kaa mauka mili
 By the way, if Salman Khan's film is being released on a festival like Diwali, then the expectation is that there will be a new record film
 magar 40 karod kaa shahrukh kaa record todegi yaa nahin, diwali ke duusare din yani 12 november kii raat tak pataa chal jaayegaa

 But the girl appeared again after a while
 unhone aage bataaya, is baar ladki ne aagrah se poocha ki kya manna de kaa ghar yahi he
 Manna Dey bluntly asked why she came, she was a big fan of him and wanted to touch his feet once
 yah sunakar de narm pad gaye or us ladki ko andar aane diya
 He was very gracious
 manna de ne apane sangeet kariyar main hindi, bangla, gujarati, marathi, malayalam, kannada, asmi filmon main parshv gayak ke rup main apni aawaaj di
 He loved Indian regional music, but was also acceptable to mix traditional music, modernity with melody and raga
 chatarji ne kaha, vah koi bhi nayaa sur, nayaa raag, nai boli bahut jaldi sikhte the, aisa nahin hota to kai sari bhashaaon main unke geet nahin hote

 - input IANS Film Name: Race 3 Director: Remo d'souzastar Cast: Salman Khan, Jacqueline Fernandes, Saqib Saleem, Daisy Shah, Bobby Deol, Anil Kapoor, Freddy Daruwalla Duration: 2 hours 39 minutes Certification: u / a Rating: 2 Star pair in 2008 by Abbas Mastan Race franchise's first film 'race' was made and at that time the film created a panic at the box office
 uske baad 2013 main res-2 banaayi gayi
 Which got a good response
 ab salmaan khan kii maujuudagi ke saath res-3 kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he, jise remo disuja ne diarect kiya he
 Remo's best business was done by Remo as a director
 lekin uske alaava baaki filmon ne niraash bhi kiya he
 Let's review how the star-studded film Race 3 is made
 
 Aamir Khan has not yet seen Salman's Race-3, said
 
 
 kahanefilm kii kahani gulf country se shuru hoti he jahaan shamsher singh (anil kapur) apane do bacchon sanjana (daiji shah) or suraj (saaqib saleem) ke saath rahata he
 At the same time, his stepson business is also looked after by his step son Sikander (salman Khan)
 sikandar kaa kareebi yash (bobi deol) he
 The twist in the story comes when Rana (freddy Daruwala) enters, who wants to destroy Shamsher Singh's business
 kahani main jesica (jacleen furnandis) kaa bhi alag kirdaar he
 You have to watch the film to know about drugs, weapons, chase sequences and how Shamsher Singh decides the journey from Allahabad to Gulf Country, what are the reasons behind it and what eventually happens

 # Selfish on @gaana : https: / / gaa
 na / selfisha post shared bysalman Khan (@beingsalmankhan) onmay 24, 2018 at 12:27 pm PDT Weak Kadian: The film's story is very weak and the screenplay is even weaker
 kisi bhi kirdaar ko nyaaysangat kar paane main lekhak asamarth rahe hai
 There is neither the presence of a hero, nor any tremendous villain
 film ke lambey lambe gane bhi isaki length ko bahut bada bana dete hai
 The selfish song comes at 2 different times
 kahani kab hathiyaaron ke kaarobaar se drugs or veshyavriti main lipt mantirayon tak pahunchati he, phir ek hi parivaar ke logon ke bich kaa antarkahal dikhaaya jaataa he
 It all seems fishy
 'res ' kaa naam aate hi twist or terns saamne aate hai lekin is baar aise twist or terns hai jo aapako baandh paane main naakaamayaab rahete hai
 In a way, only disappointment comes
 film main kai baar uttar pradesh kii bhashaa kaa prayog karne kii koshish kii gayi he, jo ki galat andaaj main saamne aati he
 The film's 3D quality is also not accurate
 'tiger jinda he' se zyada res-3 kii advance booking, pehle din kamayegi itanejanie aakhir film ko kyon dekh sakate hanyadi aap salmaan khan ke bahut bade fain hai or unki film dekhe bagaiyr rah nahin pate, to ek baar jaakar tri kar sakate hai
 The work of Anil Kapoor, Bobby Deol, Daisy Shah, Saqib Saleem, Jacqueline Fernandes and the rest of the cast is effortless
 becoground score acha he
 The action is great, there are chase sequences but quite long
 Sach Batau 
 We were not ready with the # race3trailer
 Is liye itne posters banaye 
 But Intezar ka fal meetha hota hai
 The # Race3 trailer coming to you on May15 
 And i promise u the wait will be worth it

 sansad ke monsoon satr kaa aagaaj ho gaya he
 Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar has expressed the hope that the monsoon session of Parliament will go smoothly
 aupchaariktaaon ke baad mira kumaar ne loksabhaa kii kaarywahi mangalvaar tak ke liye sthagit kar di
 On the other hand, there was a lot of uproar in the Rajya Sabha on the very first day of the session

 When the Speaker's request had no effect on the members, the proceedings of the House were adjourned till Tuesday

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, however, appealed to the opposition on Monday morning to cooperate in resolving various issues pending before the nation in this session of Parliament
 unhone aashwast kiya ki sarkaar vipaksh dwaara uthaaye jane vaale kisi bhi mudde par vistrut charchaa ke liye taiyaar he
 Earlier, Sushma Swaraj had said on Sunday that the opposition wants the Parliament to run
 vipaksh aam aadmi ko pareshaan karne vaali manhagaai, chaaron taraf faile bhrashtachar, mumbai aatanki hamale se sambandhit aantarik suraksha ke maamle, telugana kii bigadati sthiti, barbaad hoti ja rahi air india or naksalwad aadi ke mudde uthaanaa chahta he
 Notices have also been given to discuss these

 BJP, AIADMK and Left parties are planning a strategy to target both of them in view of the charges leveled by the jailed former Telecom Minister a Raja against the Prime Minister and Home Minister p Chidambaram in the 2G spectrum case
 lokapal vidheyak ke praaroop ko lekar bhi sarkaar or vipaksh ke bich takaraav kii ashanka he
 The government intends to introduce this bill on August 3
 is vidheyak ke daayre main pradhanmantri ko laae jane ke bare main samprag main ek raay nahin he
 The opposition's strategy is also visible to the ruling party and that is why the Prime Minister almost laughed the opposition saying that he is not afraid of anything, because the opposition has many 'shameful secrets'

 Yes, this question seems strange because the bail is forfeited not by the parties but of the candidates, but if the candidates' formula is applied to the parties, then it can be said that on the basis of seats won by the Aam Aadmi Party in the MCD elections She has barely survived the bail

 marwaah ko mahima patel or kiran randhaava ke naam se creat kiye gaye do phek fasebuk acount ke jariye fansaaya gaya tha
 Marwah said that he sent important documents of Air Force to both girls on whatsapp

 That is why he bought SIM cards himself and sent them
 sutron ke anusaar, marwaah se fasebuk par sampark main ai kiran randhaava naam kii mahila ne apni umr 20 ke kareeb bataai or khud ko modelling se judaa bataaya
 Marwah came in contact with Kiran during a trip to Trivandrum in December last year

 Such stolen documents from Air Force Headquarters are forbidden to carry smart phones at Air Force Headquarters in Delhi
 kuch ucchadhikariyon ko hi smart phone andar le jane diya jaataa he
 Since the accused Arun Marwah was a group captain, there was no restriction on him carrying the smartphone inside the headquarters
 maarvaha ne apni varishthata kaa istemaal kiya or mukhyalay ke andar hameshaa apana smart phone le jaataa
 Marwah captured the intelligence documents through his smart phone and later sent the agent of ISI to the Pakistani intelligence agency through whatsapp

 Also Marwah was very active on social platforms
 vah aksar fasebuk par apnitasviren or video aplodkia karte the
 That is why they were implicated as easy prey
 marwaah ke paas thim vayusena kii yah jimmedaariyanvayusena ke para divijan main 1983 main shaamil hue marwaah teen saal baad trainer ban gaye
 From the very beginning, his image was of a very professional soldier
 chunki sabhi raksha sevaaon kii commando ikaayiyon ko jameen, samudr or hawa main yuddh karne kaa prashikshan diya jaataa he, isliye group captain marwaah sena ke vishesh balon, vaayu sena kii garud commando or nausena ko bhi prashikshan dete the

 Until now, it will be mandatory for Madrasas who have kept themselves away from the festivals of Hindus to leave on almost all major Hindu festivals
 diwali, dashahra, budh poornima or mahavir jayanti ke saath-saath ramanavami, raksha bandhan or christmas kii bhi chuttee anivaary hogi
 Holiday Calendar for Madrasas The Yogi government of Uttar Pradesh has released a holiday calendar for madrasas
 isamen kai chhuttiyon ko khatm kiya gaya he, to kai chhuttiyaan shaamil hui hai
 The madrasas of UP will now have Diwali, Dussehra, Budh Purnima and Mahavir Jayanti holidays
 abhi tak madrason main sirf holi or ambedkar jayanti kii chhuttiyaan hoti thim
 Many holidays have been ended, while the Yogi government has added 7 new holidays to the Kamaalasara calendars, while the Madrasas have reduced the 10 special holidays for Eid and Muharram in the year to 4
 yani koi bhi madrasa ab in parvon par 4 din se zyada chuttee nahin de saktaa
 Yogi Sarkar says that these calendars are being done like all other basic government schools so that no discrimination can be seen

 On the third day, several important issues were raised in both houses
 loksabhaa main chit fund bill charchaa ke baad paas hua to vahiin rajyasabha main sarogesi bill or transgender persons bill par mahatvapurn charchaa hui
 Apart from this, Home Minister Amit Shah gave a detailed answer to the latest situation in Jammu and Kashmir and questions related to NRC in Rajya Sabha
 loksabhaa main paas hua chit fund amendament bill 2019buudhvaar ko loksabhaa main chit fund amendament bill 2019 par lambii charchaa hui or ant main dhvanimat se yah bill paas ho gaya
 Let us tell you that given the importance of the subject, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha had extended the period of the House for half an hour so that the amendments suggested for the Bill can be discussed and passed
 loksabhaa main dopaher kareeb 3 baje chit fund bill par dobaaraa charchaa shuru hui
 Members of all political parties took part in this discussion and gave their suggestions

 When Amit Shah was responding to the questions raised by Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, there was an uproar from the opposition

 rashtriya naagarik register se jude saiyad nasir hossain ke sawaal ke jawaab main grih mantri amit shah ne kaha ki logon ko enarasi or citigenship amendament bill ko lekar kanfusion he
 There is no provision inside NRC that people of other religions should not be taken on the register
 sabhi dharmon ke logon ko isamen liya jayega jo bharat ke naagarik hai
 There is no question of discriminating on the basis of religion
 enarasi ek alag prakiya he or citigenship amedament bill ek alag prakriya he
 The Home Minister further said that the NRC process in Assam was taken up under the Supreme Court
 enarasi kii prakriya jab puure desh main hogi to assam main enarasi kii prakriya phir se kii jaaegi
 People of any religion need not be afraid

 His incentiva is also not being paid

 adhyapaki ke apane kareer kii shuruyaat bipin chandra ne dilli ke hindu college se kii thi
 After this he taught at Delhi University for many years and in 1971 he joined Jawaharlal Nehru University
 mujhe yaad he, main jab uttar pradesh main aligarh muslim uniwarsity (eemyu) kaa chaatr hua karata tha, tab ve itihaaskaaron ke us samooh kaa hissaa the jisamen tapan raichoudhary, romila thapar or es
 Eminent celebrities like Gopal were involved
 in sabaki ore ham badi shradgha or prerana vaali drushti se dekha karte the
 From the point of view of reverence because he had given India a different identity in the world
 itihaaskaaron kaa yah samooh desh ke siyaasi mizaaj kii, radical mizaaj kii jhalak detaa tha
 By then, the Nehru era was over
 pandit nehru kii maut ho chuki thi
 Yet there was a strong commitment to Nehru-era ideas such as secularism, development, science and technology and the spread of education
 ashavad ab bhi paryaapt tha or vah in itihaaskaaron ke vishwa darshan main bhi jhalkata tha
 But he was not in favor of maintaining the status quo, he was a critic of it
 unhone apane khud ke sawaal taiyaar kiye the or unke uttar bhi die the jo sthapit vishwa darshan se ittefaq nahin rakhte the
 During that time, we had read about the great works going on all over the world
 lekin in shakhsiyaton kaa kaam sabase alag or niraala tha
 These were new sounds of a kind
 unke vichaar or sidghant bilkul bhinn the
 Despite this, they were all unanimous about the nature of how history writing should be done in India
 unka vaishvik darshan ek sa tha, jo aavashyak rup se hameshaa marxvaadi nahin tha
 It was a combination of Marxism and Nehruism
 unki apil jabardast thi kyonki ve avyaavhaarik nahin the
 They knew what was important
 british raaj kii unki prabhaavshaalee tikaaon main yah baat jhlakati he
 The Rise and Growth of Economic Nationalism is considered to be Chandra's most important work
 isamen unhone vyavasthit dhang or vistrut sansadhano kii madad se janchetana ke vikaas main aarthik rashtrawaad ko mahatvapurn kaarak ke rup main pahachaanaa he
 He succeeded in proving that some Congress leaders like Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Ferozeshah Mehta and Dadabhai Naoroji were from a civilized and wealthy society, yet they managed to deal with issues like poverty, inequality and dwindling wealth in different categories
 Were able to understand the interests
 aisa nahin he ki british nitiyon kii aalochana pehali baar hui ho
 Naoroji had done this
 lekin chandra ne ise ek khaas disha or rujhaan di
 Chandra's special point was his way of supporting the nationalist movement
 isaki khub aalochana hui
 But i feel that getting that great movement under Gandhi's leadership at that point of time was very important to end the deception of British colonialism
 har desh ke itihaas main kuch aise maukey hote hi hai jab kisi vyakti yaa vichaar kii bharpoor saraahna kii gai ho
 You may not agree with this, but this is completely logical
 chandra keval vichaarak hi nahin, mahaan shikshak bhi the
 He was at the top of his academic career while being a teacher at Delhi University
 ve apane chaatro ko sawaal poochne ke liye protsaahit karte the
 They would be friendly with them and make easy contact
 kahin bhi, kisi bhi shikshak kii yah sabase badi uplabdhi hoti he
 That is why the students were his admirers
 yahaan tak ki anya vishyon or sankaay ke chaatr bhi unki ore aakarshith hote the
 In this sense, he was somewhat like Mohammed Habib of AMU
 khayr, ab vah daur biit chukaa he
 There are no longer teachers with such a liberal attitude towards social science
 aaj ve hote to pashchimi samrajyavad or samaaj main anyaay jaise aaj ke gambhir muddon ke khilaaf jarur aawaaj uthaate
 The important work he did at the last stage of his career as a writer was about communalism
 unke nazariye main ek tarah kii taazgi thi
 This is largely because he waged a fight against communalism, perhaps because he had gained a lot of experience in his youth and later years
 bhraamak jaagrukta kii avadharana ve hi saamne laae the, jiskaa mul rup se yah arth hota tha ki vastav main sampradayikta jaisi koi cheez he hi nahin kyonki samaaj main iskaa astitv hi nahin he-isaki shuruyaat angrejon ne kii thi or unke jane ke baad bhi bhartiya samaaj ne apane nihit swaarthon kii vajah se ise jinda rakhaa
 Chandra believed both minority and majority communalism to be the same and according to him, both types of communalism are bad
 bataur activist ve in donon ke khilaaf lade
 Perhaps some of us would not consider this to be misleading awareness
 ham maanate hai ki bhartiya samaaj main sampradayikta kii jaden bahut gahari hai or alpsankhyakon kii asuraksha kii ore dhyaan dene kii bhi jarurat he
 Despite this difference of opinion, this intervention was significant

 Now Tina Sharma has accused her own party of working for power and has revolted on ticket distribution
 tina sharma ne yah daawa kiya he ki party pehle hi dilli kii paanch loksabhaa siton ke liye ummidavaar ke naam tay kar chuki he
 The process of filling the form for the ticket is a mere sham
 haal main AAP jwine karne vaali tina sharma ne kaha, 'dilli main paanch loksabhaa siton ke liye ummidavaaron ke naam tay ho chuke hai
 The party will get tickets to Shazia Ilmi, Ashutosh Kumar, Gopal Rai, Dilip Pandey and Ashish Talwar
 ab sawaal yah he ki tikat ke liye logon se form kyon bharwaaye ja rahe hai
 He alleged that the party had not done any work on the 2013 manifesto till now
 par dhyaan 2014 ke menifesto par he
 Actually, the party's focus is only on the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 aam aadmi ke jo mudde the wo kahin chhip gaye

 unka kahana tha, 'AAP kii kerani-kathani main fark main aa gaya he
 His displeasure is on the issues
 na ki kisi pad ke liye
 As soon as Binny's statement came to the fore, there was a stir in the party
 netaa ishaaron hi ishaaron main pehle binni ko swaarthee bataane lage
 Senior party leader Sanjay Singh even asked him to leave the party
 haalanki vinod binni bagawati tevar thame nahin
 He refused to resign from the party and said that he would put his point before the press conference on Thursday
 iske baad media main AAP ke sutron ke hawaale se khabar ai ki vinod kumaar binni purvi dilli seat se loksabhaa kaa tikat nahin die jane se naaraaz hai
 So they are making rhetoric
 tikat vaali baat par to dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne bhi muhar laga di
 He called Binny ambitious in gestures and said, 'binny last time wanted a ministerial position, now he wants to get a Lok Sabha ticket
 unki naaraazgi kii vajah kaa mujhe pataa nahin, vahi bataaenge
 Buoyed by these allegations, Vinod Kumar Binny launched a big attack on Kejriwal

 darasal, supreme court ne campa cola sosayadi ke avaidh flats dharakon ko aadesh diya he ki unhen 31 may 2014 tak campa cola parisar khaali kar dena hoga
 Taking a dig at the Supreme Court, Uddhav Thackeray said that instead of thinking seriously on this issue, efforts are being made to resolve it in a hurry
 unhone kaha ki campa cola sosayadi ke 140 pariwaron ko raahat milani chahie
 Uddhav wrote in his editorial, 'who will give justice to 140 families of Campa Cola? The courts are so responsible that keep the terrorists alive, but on the other hand there was no hesitation in sending 140 families to the door of death
 'unhone kaha, 'kanoon sakht hona chahie magar samvedanheen nahin

 He said, "tainted leaders can contest elections from jail or not, if the Supreme Court can change its decision on this matter, then why not in the Campa Cola case?" Even before this, illegal construction has been regularized many times
