 nyaayalay ne sarkaar ke ravaiye par talkh tippaniyan karte hue is maamle kii sunwaayee 30 oktober ke liye sthagit kar di
 The judges expressed displeasure at the failure of the authorities to provide government accommodation to the chairman and members of the Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal constituted a year ago
 nyaayadhishon ne kaha, ‘aap gahari nidra main chale jate hai or phir chaahate hai ki nyaayalay aapako jagaae
 Why do you force us to do what we are not doing? God help you and the country
 ’karnataka or goa ke bich jal vivaad ke nibatare ke liye november 2010 main is nyaayaadhikaran kaa gathan hua tha
 Additional Solicitor General Harin Rawal, citing a government circular dated April 2012, said that members of the tribunal are not entitled to government accommodation under the general pool
 lekin nyaayalay unke is tark se santusht nahin hua
 The judges said, "as per rules they are entitled to get accommodation
 aap unhen dene se inkaar nahin kar sakate hai jab awaas uplabdh hai
 Do you want retired judges to roam the streets of Delhi? If you do not want the tribunal to work, then the law providing for the appointment of judges for them should be abolished
 ’ Jitanram Manjhi, the former Chief Minister of Bihar and head of Hindustan Awam Morcha, is often in controversy due to his statements
 is baar phir matadaataaon ko apane ek suzav diya he
 In view of the Bihar elections, Manjhi has appealed to his supporters - 'first voting, then alcoholism
 ' iske peeche maanjhi ne ashanka jataai he ki unke samarthakon ko behosh karne ke liye vishaiylla padaarth milaayaa ja saktaa he
 It is to be noted that Manjhi is contesting from two seats Imamganj in Gaya and Makdumpur in Jehanabad district

 tufaanon se aankh milaao, sailabon par waar karo, ishk khata he to yah khata ek baar nahin, 100 baar karo
 This lion of relief Indauri gives encouragement to all the heartfelt lovers who find themselves imprisoned in the chains of love
 jinke liye pyaar sirf ek baar hota he, jaisi baaten duniya kaa sabase bada jhooth hai
 The excuses these girls often get in love with girls are interesting in themselves
 ye hai ladakon ko riject karte vakt ladakiyon ke 10 bahaane1
 You are like my brother - the first excuse that brings the feeling of Raksha Bandhan in the hearts of boys as soon as they express love, is that - you are like my brother
 maine tumhen kabhi is najar se nahin dekha
 i considered you as a brother and you
 
 
 chhi chhi
 This excuse gives birth to a shock in boys
 bahaanaa sunate hi aashiq ko kai din sadame se nikalne main lag jate hai
 2
 pyaar maai foot-jis tarah bhoot he yaa nahin, isko lekar kaaphi sanshay he, thik usee tarah kuch sundariyon ko pyaar ke astitv par shaq rahata he
 In such a situation, if an innocent heart tries to love a beautiful person, then the first answer comes
 'pyaar maai foot', mujhe pyaar main yakeen nahin he
 However, this excuse has become like a VCR cassette in today's era, which is rarely used
 3
 Have you seen your face - when the matter is going on in the heart and the appearance comes in the middle, then understand that your case will not fit in the temple of love
 ladkiyaan pyaar kaa izhaar karte vakt aksar gusse main yah kah detii hai ki 'apni shakl dekhi he kya'
 In such a situation, the heart is broken the most for those boys who covertly get facials several times a month
 4
 All boys are the same - the girls whom the boys betray in love, such girls create a bad image about the boys and every time the boy who comes close gets the prize that 'all boys are the same
 '
 haalanki yah bahaanaa 'shakl dekhi he' vaale bahaane kii kaat karata he
 5
 maa-baap ko dhokhaa-bornvita or bhagwaan krishna ko guru maanate hue ladke apane rapatate dil kii baat jaise hi ladakiyon ke saamne rakhte hai, fat se jaise jawaab aata he, main apane maa-baap-parivaar ko dhokhaa nahin de sakati
 Hearing this excuse, the boys feel that love is sought from you
 
 Home registry papers are not asked for
 6
 Career is important Career is lost after love
 is atoot satya kaa gyaan ladakon ke pyaar kaa izhaar karte hi ladkiyaan de detii hai
 The boys who express it get this knowledge when they have spent many tuition fees to buy greeting cards
 7
 What is my age? Voter card is necessary to love
 yahi sawaal sochate hue ladakon ne ghanton park main bitaa die honge, jab kisi khubasurat premika ne yah kaha hoga ki meri abhi umr hi kya he
 Are you older or younger than me
 8
 Baba ji's entry of this excuse in the pretext of not confessing to love
 par jis teji se isane ekatarfa ishk kii bagiya main paanv pasaare hai, aisa maaloom hota he ki aane vaala kal isi bahaane kaa he
 9
 meraa bwoyfriend he-meraa bwoyfriend he
 
 bas ye sunate hi ladakon ke dimag or jubaan par yahi sawaal aa jaataa he ki mujhamen kya kami he
 This excuse has topped the category of creating frustration
 is bahaane ke kaan main ghuste hi ladke aasmaan kii ore dekhte hue kalpanaaon ke sagar main utarkar apni tulana us ladke se karne lagate hai, jiskaa zikr bahaane ke taur par yaa sachai bataate hue ladkiyaan kar detii hai
 10
 main us tarah kii ladki nahin hum-mahilaon ko baantne kii ranneeti ke tahat hi is bahaane kaa janm hua tha
 The boys sometimes get to hear 3 magical words
 main baaki ladakiyon jaisi nahin hum
 In such a situation, there is doubt in the mind of the person who expresses love and a desire to find out where to bring that kind of girl
 pyaar kaa majaa tab hi he, jab kai baar inkaar ho, takaraar ho, kabhi kabhaar maar bhi ho
 So in such a case, if a boy has true love with a girl, then he should not be afraid of these excuses and try to prove his love
 lekin simaaon kaa dhyaan rahe, dar film ke shahrukh khan banoge to bhaiya vahi haal hoga jo shahrukh kaa ki

 It happened at the end of the film
 baaki pyaar sachcha he to raahat indori ke tode gaye is sher ko dimag main baitha lijie, 'phulon kii dukaane kholo, khushboo kaa vyapaar karo, mallahon kaa chakkar chodo, tair kar nadiyaan paar karo'

 a 8 km long road has been constructed
 unhone ekajutata or hausale kii nayab misaal pesh kii he
 Superintendent of Police Ratanlal Dangi connected these campaigns by mobilizing these tribals
 sambhageeya mukhyalay jagadalpur se mahaj 62 kimi dur hone ke baavjood sadak na hone se yah ilaaka vikaas se koson dur tha
 Subhash Nag, sarpanch of Chandela, one of the 24 villages around the newly constructed road, says, "before the road was built, people had to cross the Indravati river and carry ration from 10 km away
 ' or ab sadak banane ke baad rashan gadiyon se yahaan ke rahavaasiyon tak pahunch rahaa he
 The 8 km long road from Paroda village of Puspal Ghat to the last village Kakanar was proposed for 20 years but due to the fear of Maoists, no one was willing to take the contract
 ilaake ke vikaas kii raah main pehla kadam tha 21 april, 2011 main kakanar main police kii chaowkee kaa bananaa
 There was no road, so the soldiers of the post were taken here by helicopter with accessories
 gambhir samasya us vakt ai jab helicopter na milane par biimaar javaanon ko ilaaj ke liye le janaa mushkil ho gaya
 Then Dangi thought why not do this difficult task of road construction with the help of villagers
 par samasya yah thi ki chaowkee khulne se baukhalaaye maovadiyon ne kakanar ke postmaster or sachiv samet chaar logon kii police kaa sahyogi bataakar hatya kar di thi
 Therefore, it was not easy to convince the tribals for road construction
 phir bhi dangi ne ummid nahin chodi
 Eventually five villagers of Puspal Ghat agreed to build the road
 is abhiyaan kii shuruyaat 7 janvari se hui
 Gradually, fear of development was replaced by fear and by 12 January, 50 people had contributed to this work
 baad main graminon kii taadaad badhkar 500 tak pahunch gai
 The number of women was also higher among them sadak nirmaan ke kaam main jute graminon kii suraksha kaa jimmaa police or estf ke javaanon par tha
 Before the villagers came and went, a police contingent inspected the road including bomb disposal and dog squad
 kaam ke dauraan bhi kareeb 100 jawan graminon ke chaaron ore gheraa banaae rakhte the
 After two months of hard work, the tribals managed to build a road in the hills and forests surrounded by their steely spirits

 yah ilaaka abujhmaad samet dakshin bastar se bhi jud gaya he
 Puspal Ghat, which was once deserted like desert and surrounded by silence, is now starting to look alive due to the increase in the movement of people

 The novel titled 'phir Bhi Shesh' also conveys a deep destructive environment and the survival of life through it

 In this way, Rajkamal gives the reader the fact that life is not blocked, nor should it be blocked

 What to save from them
 phir bhi shesh ek paariwarik ghatana kii prishthbhumi se upajataa he
 The elder sister of the heroine Himani dies after marriage and her elder sister is left with a daughter Rutu and son Narendra orphan Shishwat
 himani ke bahanoi sukhdev apane pita or bade bhai ke vyavsaay se jude hai
 What is the nature of joining the business, these pages open very late in front of Himani in the story
 nirnaayak prashn yah he ki himani bahanoi kii duusari patni banakar bahan ke bacchon kaa daayitv maa kii tarah sambhaal le yaa apane man ke swar ko pahachaanate hue apni raah ke chunaav main apni swatantra bhoomika nibhaae? himani ke jivan kaa ek nirnaayak pal
 There is a need for more sanity and sensational vision than sentimentality, but winning is sentimental
 himani kaa vivaah sukhdev se ho janaa is upanyaas kaa prasthaan bindu he
 Several streams of social discourse erupt from here, making the novel multidimensional
 sukhdev ke parivaar kii andruni raajnneeti katha kaa ek maarmik ghatak he
 Sukhdev's brother-in-law does not find the position of Himani himself to be a mother to his interests
 ve sukhdev ko phu salaakar himani ke maa banane ke raste main chadmpurna rode atakaate rahete hai
 Himani does not become a mother till the end
 sukhdev sharaabi or gairjimmedaar he
 Everyone can feed him
 aise main uski santan kaa bhatak janaa swaabhaavik he
 Himani is the only committed well-wisher of those children, but she is accompanied by Vimata's adjective, which Sukhdev's sister-in-law keeps giving
 sukhdev kaa bada betaa sharaabi ho gaya he par jaise-taise ek seth ke paas bataur driver kaam paa jaataa he
 Seth caught the path of politics and thus opened a new window in the novel from where the state of the country's politics was exposed
 beti ritu model banane nikali
 Amidst this narrative configuration, there is a character, lawyer Aditya
 ek vahi he jo himani se maanviya sarokaar rakhata hua bhaavana ke str par bhi judata he
 He is also in the role of practical consultant for Himani
 sukhdev ke makaan main kiraayedaar he vah
 Himani's association with Aditya does not like Sukhdev
 dhire-dhire himani samaj jaati he ki uskaa baar-baar kaa garbhpaat ek sajeesh kaa nateeja he
 Here the novel presents a concept, which is against social recognition on the human
 himani ke man main vichaar aata he ki vah apni antarang sakhi ke pati se santan paakar apni riktata ko bhar le
 On this, both the dialogues and their different mindsets make enough space in the dimension of the novel
 yahaan raajakmal ne ek nai or maanviya sambhaavna ko sthapit karne kaa saahasik kadam uthaaya he
 In the epilogue of the novel, Himani is the mother of many babies
 vah ek baalagram main sevarat ho jaati he, jisaki raah use aditya ne sujhai he
 There are several important points between Himani reaching this decision, whose vibrations can be found only by passing through the text
 is upsanhaar main bhi ek clymex he
 Himani has to accept the daughter of his step daughter Ritu in his Balagram
 himani us navaagat shishu kii nani he lekin use is tathy ko gopneey hi rakhana he
 Once again the question is only of dignity
 ekbar phir himani ke hisse main ek anaath shishu he, jisaki maa is sansar main nahin he
 Spread over a large canvas, this novel will be remembered for its diverse installations while at the same time there is some relaxation due to the multiplicity of the episodes and the contingency of the events
 sukhdev kii mrityu, ritu kii mrityu, aditya kaa vivaah, yah kuch sthitiyaan katha prasang main bojhlita laati hai
 But there is no doubt that through these, Rajkamal has given many ideological departure points to the society
 yah tatv rachana kaa utkarsh kaha ja saktaa he
 The accused teenager, who murdered a three-and-a-half-year-old girl in Nagpada area of mumbai for a ransom of Rs 1 crore, panicked and killed the girl after knocking at the door of the girl's mother
 aropiyon ne 5 disambar ko kajipura ke haji kasam chaal kii pehali manzil se ladki ko agava kiya tha
 a senior police officer said that he abducted the girl who was unconscious after smelling chloroform
 use pados main rahane vaale ek aaropee ke ghar lekar gaye
 When the girl's mother arrived there to find her and knocked on the door, the two panicked and strangled the mobile phone charger and killed her
 unhone kaha ki donon aropiyon ne ladki kii maa ko yah kehete hue ghusane nahin diya ki unamem se ek naha rahaa he
 He then placed the body in a polythene bag and took it to the roof
 police ko andeh he ki dakshin mumbai main ek college main padhane vaale chaatro ne vigyaan prayogshaala se chlorofarm liya tha
 Police claimed that during interrogation, the accused confessed to the crime and described the entire incident
 aaropee ladki ke pita kii aarthik haisiyat se kaaphi prabhavit the kyonki ve logon ko mahangi kaaron main unase milane aate-jate dekhte the
 Then he planned to kidnap the girl for ransom
 college kaa pehla din sabhi ke liye behad khaas hota he
 He walked out of the uniform on the first day to wear casual clothes
 kisi kaa apane ghar se dur duusare shahar main shift hona
 Or to meet new friends
 ye sari yaaden college ke pehle din ko sabhi ke liye special bana detii hai
 But there are many places in the world where taking college admission is not easy at all
 achche marks ke saath-saath acchhee khaasi fees lagati he
 For this reason, college admission for many students as well as their parents is no less than a dream
 kuch aisi hi excitement texas kii ek mahila main dikhi, jo apni beti ke college main admician kii khabar ko sun itani khush hui ki wo principal ke offis main hi naachne lagi
 Watch this video here 
 
 video main aap dekhenge ki lajuana mccree naam kii is mahila ko uski beti ke skool ke kol aata he, wo pehle thodi nervas hoti he
 But as soon as she finds out on the phone that her daughter has got admission in the college, then she starts twerking in the principal's office
 is video ko Grand Prairie Independent School ne online share kiya
 It is not often seen in the post that someone is happily dancing in the parent principal's office in this way

 peedita ne bhare hue gale se kaha ki vah khud apane haathon se gunahagaaron ko sajaa dena chaahati he
 The victim, who wants to punish the accused herself, told Aaj Tak that she will be comforted only when she breaks the eyes of the culprits
 peedit mahila ne maang karte hue kaha ki pehle vah apane gunahagaaron ko khud sajaa degi, uske baadpuliceor kanoon unka hisaab kare
 The victim's woman said that she wanted to kill the poor people with her own hands
 police chaahati to sabhi aaropee hote giraftaarpeedit mahila ke man main police ke khilaaf bhi jabardast gussa tha
 While speaking to Aaj Tak, expressing her anger, the victim said that if the police had wanted, all the accused would have been arrested by now
 lekin itane din biit jane par bhi police ne sirf teen ko hi giraftaar kiya he
 While the police had said to arrest all the accused within 24 hours
 aatmahatya kii chetavaneepulice ke khilaaf gussa or apana dard bayaan karte hue peedit mahila ne kaha ki agararopeagle 24 ghante me giraftaar nahin honge, to vah apane pati or beti ke saath khudakushi kar legi
 The negligence of the police was also revealed
 Earlier, in the Bulandshahr gang rape case, in addition to the SSP at the scene, the salvage of the victims, about 36 hours after the inspection of the DIG and STF, clearly shows the negligence of the police
 philhal police adhikari chuppi saadhe hai
 Aajtak's team had visited the spot, so a gold chain and a woman's purse were found in the field, while the police should have recovered it earlier

 Jim Laker made this history in the fourth Test of the england-australia series at Old Trafford, Manchester

 Then Jim missed out on taking the full 10 wickets, as Tony Lock took one wicket
 31 july ko test ke aakhri din foloan khelte hue australia ne apni duusari pari main 84 / 2 ke score se aage khelnaa shuru kiya tha
 The process of taking the wicket of Jim Laker was continuing

 After Laker, India's leg-spinner Anil Kumble repeated the record of taking ten wickets in the innings

 pradhanmantri narendra modi apane chunavi bhaashanon main aksar purv kii congress sarkaron or unke pradhanmantriyon ko nishane par lete aae hai
 In this episode, he blamed former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru for the stampede this time during the Kumbh held in 1954
 piem modi ne buudhvaar ko upi ke kaushambi main jansabha ke sambodhit karte hue kaha ki pandit nehru jab kumbh meley main aae the tab avyavashtha ke chalate bhagdad main hajaaron logon kii maut ho gai thi, lekin congress ne is khabar ko dabaa diya
 After this statement by the Prime Minister, the discussion has intensified whether the stampede incident actually happened due to Nehru's visit to Kumbh and whether the newspapers then suppressed this news under Congress pressure
 akhbaar isliye kyonki tab bharat main tivi kaa daur nahin tha
 The public depended on the newspaper and radio for news
 haalanki kuch varisht patrakaron kaa maananaa he ki bhagdad kii ghatana ke liye nehru ko jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 There are two major arguments behind this argument
 pehla nehru haadase ke din kumbh main maujuud hi nahin the or doosraa tab bheed ko niyantrit karne ke liye aaj jaise intjaam karnaa bhi mushkil tha
 Piyush Babale, a senior journalist questioning Nehru's existence, says that the stampede incident in Kumbh took place on 3 February 1954, while Pandit Nehru arrived for a bath at the Kumbh Mela on 2 February
 kubh snaan se baad nehru vahaan ke intjaamon se santusht hokar purv nirdhaarit kaarykram ke tahat usee din ravaanaa ho gaye the
 Piyush Nehru quotes Wangmay section 25 that the details of the proceedings of the Parliament and Nehru's speech recorded in Parliament mention this incident
 isamen nehru ne kaha tha ki hoicourt ke ritred jaj ke netritv main haadase kii jaanch ke liye cameti gathit kar di gai he
 He also expresses condolences to the dead in it
 nehru ne saansadon ko yah mudda uthaane ke liye prerit bhi kiya or mukhyamantriyon ko 15 march ko likhe patr main is ghatana kaa zikr bhi kiya
 Pandit Nehru came to the Sangam just a day before the stampede, according to a statement published in the BBC by Prayagraj senior journalist Naresh Mishra, went to Sangam to take stock of the preparations and then went back to Delhi
 lekin raashtrapati doctor rajendra prasad haadase vaale din sangam kshetra main hi the or subah ke samay kile ke burj par baithkar dashanami sanyasiyon kaa juluus dekh rahe the
 Just then two Peshwai processions passed through and this mob took the form of stampede
 ghatana ko apni ankhon se dekhne vaale naresh mishra bibisi ko bataate hai ki 45 minute kii ye bhagdad apane aap kaabo main aa gai, lekin tab tak kareeb 700-800 log maare ja chuke the
 This was the administration's figure, but Mishra says that the number of dead would have been higher in terms of what they had seen and heard after that
 unhone bataaya ki is ghatana kii charchaa maheenon tak rahi or tab ke sabhi pramukh akhabaron ne kumbh ke is haadase ko kai dinon tak prakashit kiya
 What happened that day? According to the description of photo journalist NN Mukherjee, published in the English newspaper The Statesman, at least a thousand people were killed and close to two thousand were injured in this rage
 mukherjee bataate hai ki mauni amavasya ke din 3 farvari 1954 ko baari sankhya main log sangam main pavitra snaan ke liye aae hue the
 According to Mukherjee, he was the only journalist who captured photographs of the stampede on camera
 unke mutabik chaaron taraf laashen thim or log madad kii guhaar laga rahe the
 Cholera vaccination was stopped two days before the accident, due to which large number of people had reached the Sangam area for bathing on this day
 tatkaaleen pradhanmantri nehru or raashtrapati rajendra prasad ko bhi isi din snaan ke liye aana tha
 Strong security arrangements were made in view of this
 donon netaaon kii car kareeb subah 10 baje sangam kshetra main daakhil hoti he or phir kila ghat ke liye nikal jaati he
 Barriers were put in place to control the crowd, when on the other hand the cavalry convoy of the Sadhus passes through there and breaks the ropes and moves forward
 mukherjee ke mutabik is bheed kii chapet main jo bhi aata he vah kuchal jaataa he
 Those who fell to the ground could not get up and could only ask for help
 marane waalon main 3-4 saal ke bachche se lekar bujurg mahila or purush bhi shaamil the
 Mukherjee says that even after the death of a thousand people, lice will not be laughed at the ears of the government officials and he keeps on sipping tea and coffee in the government house
 mukherjee ke mutabik sarkaar ne hajaar logon kii maut hone kii baat se puri tarah inkaar kar diya tha
 He believed that only a few monks died in this incident
 jabaki iske ulat mritkon main sone-chaandi ke aabhushan bhi mili jo ki kisi sampann parivaar kii mahila ke rahe honge
 According to Mukherjee, the dead bodies were cremated the next day and no one was allowed to take photographs
 haalanki unhone is ghatana kii kuch tasviren nikaali jinke lekar tatkaaleen mukhyamantri jibi pant unase kaaphi naaraaz the
 What was PM Modi's statement? Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed at the Kaushambi rally that when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was the Prime Minister, he once visited the Kumbh Mela
 tab panchayat se parliament tak congress kii sarkaar thi
 Then there was a stampede in Kumbh due to the chaos, thousands of people were killed, but this news was suppressed for Pandit Nehru not to be stained
 us samay kii media ne bhi un khabaron ko dikhaane kii himmat nahin jutai thi
 Neither i changed nor Amit Shah
 amit shah ke is jawaab se aap unki raajnneeti kii style ko samaj sakate hai
 Probably no place for atonement
 lekin amit shah ko maine dilli ke vidhansabha chunaavon main 100-50 kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte dekha tha
 i felt that the national president would return after seeing such a small crowd, but Amit Shah had completed his program in the South Delhi area
 amit shah somnath mandir trust ke adhyaksh hai
 He has also been the President of Gujarat Cricket Association
 ek rajaneta kii jivan yatra dilachasp hoti he
 No one knows when that book becomes a book and when the book's footnotes

 Amit Shah has also changed BJP
 darjanon zilon main bijepi kaa nayaa daftar banaaya gaya
 Amit Shah planned them and before the end of his term, a new office of BJP was ready in many districts of the country
 duusari party ke netaaon ke bare main hamane suna he ki party kaa paisa lekar duusare dal main bhaag gaye magar amit shah ke nirdesan main bijepi ke kai nae daftar bane
 Delhi's headquarters is grand
 in daftaron se bhi ek nai raajnneetik vyavastha kaa andaaza ho janaa chahie tha
 Amit Shah asked the workers to keep a complete record of their performances, activities
 taaki aane vaali pidi ke log use dekh saken
 We can do research because nobody believes in oral history
 shila bhatta ke lekh main ye line padhakar hairaani bhi hui
 How seriously Amit Shah, who has changed the basic themes of history, takes facts and sources seriously in his party's history
 police ne guuruuvaar ko ek event management company ke maalik ko giraftaar kiya, jis par ek abhinetri ke saath kai baar balaatkaar karne kaa aarope he

 vah abhinetri se pehali baar disambar ke pehle hafte main mila tha
 He told the actress that he was looking for an actress for his film
 ek police adhikari ne bataaya ki kuch din baad usne abhinetri ko role ke liye upyukt bataaya or use teen lakh rupee kii peshgi dene or film sin karne ke liye apane ghar par bulaayaa
 The actress signed contracts at home
 iskaa jashn manaane ke liye ghadiyaali ne use kuch pine ko diya, jisase vah behosh ho gai

 In an exclusive conversation with Aaj Tak, he said that this was said in terms of honor and rituals and that 'raising shoes' is an idiom and it is meant only by giving respect
 iskesiyasi matlabanhin nikaale jane chahie
 Here is an excerpt from Muktsar's conversation with Munawar Rana on the phone: There is a lot of ruckus on your 'jute Wale' statement
 log kah rahe hai ki aapkaa stand badal rahaa he?munwwar:dekhie kya he ki shaayari main tafasil se baat nahin kii jaati he or is vajah se kai baar log galat samaj jate hai
 Our point has been misunderstood
 hamane kya kaha
 We said that Narendra Modi is older than us, older brother
 is baat se muraad ye thi ki agar narendra modi desh main alpsankhyakon ke hit sunishchit karen, ve ikhlaaq, kalburgi, pansaare or jitne bhi logon kaa katl hua he, unke hatyaron ke khilaaf karrwai tej karen, to main unki juuti bhi uthaa luungaa
 i do not have any enmity with them
 'juuti uthaanaa' hamaare yahaan ek muhaavarey kii tarah istemaal hota he
 It means respectfully
 piemo se bulaava aayega to jaaenge yaa nahin?munwwar:bilkul jaaenge
 But call the other litterateurs who have returned the award, only then it will be spoken properly
 hamaara jaati maamla nahin he, puure samaaj, puure mulk kaa maamla he
 We had said that if a writer does not accompany us, in that case we will go alone and fight this battle alone
 aapke aword lautaane se ek bada tabaka aapke virodh main aayaa, par ek bada tabaka aapke khulkar aapke paksh main bhi aayaa
 But after that, the side got annoyed with the jooty thing? ye meraa sher he, iskaa aap kya matlab nikaalenge
 'raising shoes' means simply and only (modi's) Ehtiram as a big
 ye koi siyaasi baat nahin thi
 We are not a political man at all
 hamaari har baat ko partiyon kii siyasat se mat jodie
 We never came to do political guidance
 ham 35-40 saal se mushaayare padhate aa rahe hai
 Everywhere we say that we have straightened the shoes of our elders and today the smell of their shoes comes from our hands

 Virender Sehwag will become the 54th player in the world and the ninth cricketer in the world to play 100 Test matches as he enters the second Test against England in Mumbai from Friday, but he started his Test career almost three and a half years before this explosive batsman
 The off-spinner Harbhajan Singh will have to wait for this
 tippaniyan Prior to the current series against England, both Sehwag and Harbhajan had 98 - 98 Test matches registered
 sahvaag team ke niyamit sadsy hai, lekin pichley dedh saal se koi test nahin khel paane vaale harbhajan kii antim ekadash main jagah tay nahin he
 With India's two main spinners r Ashwin and Pragyan Ojha performing well in the first Test in Ahmedabad, Harbhajan is unlikely to get a chance in Mumbai
 vaise sahvaag ko bhi bharat kii taraf se test maichon kaa saikadaa puraa karne ke liye kolkata main paanch disambar se hone vaale tisare test match tak intjaar karnaa padegaa
 In fact, Sehwag had played one match for the World XI and thus only 98 Test matches have been registered in his name from India
 november 2001 main test cricket main padaarpan karne vaale sahvaag shrunkhlaa ke shuru se hi 100 match khilne ko lekar utsahit the
 He had said, my first dream was to play for the country
 uske baad main 100 test match khilne kaa sapana dekhne laga
 i am glad that this moment will come soon
 yah bada sammaan he
 Significantly, if India decides to go with three spinners, then only Harbhajan will get a chance in Mumbai, as Ashwin and Ojha together took 13 wickets in the first Test match in Ahmedabad
 aswin haalanki chaar wicket le paae the, lekin mana ja rahaa he ki captain mahendra singh dhoni vijayi team main kisi tarah kaa badlaav karnaa pasand nahin karenge
 As far as Sehwag is concerned, it is certain that he will play his 100th Test match at the Wankhede Stadium
 unke liye yah aitihaasik kshan hoga kyonki yah un sachin tendulkar kaa gharelu maidan he jinke par sarvaadhik 191 test match khilne kaa record darj he jin bhartiya cricketron ne ab tak 100 se adhik test match khele hai unamem tendulkar ke alaava rahul dravid (164), vivies lakshmana (134), anil kumble (132) , kapil dev (131), sunil gavaskar (125), dilip vengsarakar (116) or saurav ganguli (113) shaamil hai

 In Uttar Pradesh, whenever a crime in politics showed its dreadful face in the last two years, a name has often cropped up as a conspirator
 yah naam tha mukhya chikitsadhikari (siemo) kaa
 In the last years of Mayawati's rule, two cmos and a deputy CMO were killed, so in the current SP government, this trend of CMO related corruption has not stopped
 gonda jile ke siemo dow
 s
 pi
 At the late night of October 8, Singh's house was raided by local MLA and Minister of State for Revenue Vinod Kumar Singh alias Pandit Singh and the CMO was abducted
 baad main dow
 Singh somehow reached Lucknow after saving his life
 ek ore siemo par aayush (ayurveda, homeopeth, unani, sidgh or yoga) doctoron kii bhartee main mantri ji kii sifarish na maanane kaa aarope tha to duusari ore mantri ji apane upar lage saare aaropon ko raajnneeti se prerit bataate hai
 When the matter got hot, Pandit Singh had to lose his post and CMO Sahab also lost his chair
 maamla yaheen nahin thama
 Pandit Singh's supporters demonstrated fiercely outside the CMO office
 unka aarope tha ki siemo doctoron or karmchaariyon ke chayan main bhrashtachar kar rahe hai
 The whole episode is now under investigation, but one thing has become clear that after all what is in the CMO chair that he is the target of everyone? Why three ministers lost their posts in one and a half years because of this chair
 darasal siemo kii kursi badi malaaidaar maani jaati he
 The race to grab this chair in government doctors started from 2005, when the Cadre Review (cadre Reorganization) of the Provincial Medical Services (PMS) came into force
 isse pehle pradesh main siemo yani sanyukt nideshak str ke 371 pad the
 cmos were deployed in about 70 of these districts
 lekin varsh 2005 main sanyukt nideshak str ke padon kii sankhya badhkar 2,475 ho gai, jinamein se saamaanya varg ke 1,000 doctoron ko siemo banane ke yogya mana gaya
 As the number of contenders for the 70 posts of CMO increased, new maneuvers were also started to get it
 zyaadaatar doctoron ne dawa mafia se sampark saadhaa
 These mafia gave money to ministers and officials in the government to make their people cmos and in return got contracts and other facilities for supply of medicines from cmos
 varsh 2007 main rashtriya gramin swasthya mishan (enarechaem) kii kai yojanaon ke liye jile main iffraat main paisa aayaa
 For example, for the first health services, the annual budget of the CMO office of the capital Lucknow where only Rs 5 crore
 tha, vahiin varsh 2007 ke baad se yah 70 karod ru
 done
 gonda jaise chote shahar kaa bajet bhi kai guna bad gaya
 Prior to NRHM, the CMO here spent Rs 1
25 crore to spend in health services
 salanaa bajet miltaa tha jo baad main badhkar 40 karod ru
 done
 jaahir he, achaanak itani badi rakam ke jile ke swasthya mahakme main pahunchate hi sabhi kii gidgh drushti is par lag gai
 The drug mafia changed its occupation to grab this money
 ab ve nirmaan-kaaryon kaa theka bhi lene lage
 In the NRHM scam, a similar drug dealer Girish Malik has been arrested on charges of rigging the construction work
 beete paanch varsh main 513 swasthya upakendron kaa nirmaan keval kaagajon par dikhaaya gaya or siemo-thekedaaron ke gathjod ne iske liye aavantit 70 karod ru
 Of the monkey
 is bhrashtachar ko kaabo karne ke liye sarkaar ne pichley siemo se enarechaem ke dhan kaa sidhaa upyog karne kaa adhikaar chin liya or ek samiti bana di, jiske adhyaksh dm or sachiv siemo hai
 Retired CMO Drs
 aar
 N
 shukla kehete hai, ''beete paanch varsh main siemo or dawa mafia ke gathjod ne enarechaem ke paise kii jamkar lutpaat kii
 An ordinary doctor became a millionaire after becoming CMO
 badi kothiyaan banavaa leen or apane saathiyon ko itani jaldi tarakkee karata dekh duusare doctor bhi siemo banane ko lalayit ho uthe
 "that is the reason that more than 50 cmos posted in the state during the last four years are on the CBI radar in corruption cases
" in adhikariyon par enarechaem ke dhan kii bandarbaant karne kaa aarope he
 Policy-makers in the government also understood this 'mathematics'
 unhone dobaaraa piemes ke niyam badale or pichley saal sanyukt nideshak str ke har doctor ko siemo banane ke liye yogya ghoshit kar diya gaya
 What was it then, the doctor who had access, became the CMO
 swasthya vibhaag ke pramukh sachiv sanjay agarwal ke bhai ajay agarwal gajiabad ke siemo bane to pradesh ke sabhi bade jilon main kisi netaa yaa adhikari ke karibiyon ne siemo kii kursi sambhaal lee
 At present, most of the time of CMO is spent in making plans to use the funds from NRHM and in recruitment of doctors and paramedical staff
 is samay puure pradesh main enarechaem ke tahat 15,000 doctoron va paramedical karmchaariyon kii bhartee prakriya chal rahi he
 They are to be selected on contract only through interviews
 kushinagar ke siemo dow
 Sanjeev Gupta has accused the minister and others of pressuring transfers and appointments
 vahiin lakhanu se sate ek jile ke siemo bataate hai ki sthaneey netaa va vidhayak siemo par apane ilaake main swasthya centre kholane ke liye prastaav banane kaa dabaav daal rahe hai or yah nahin dekha ja rahaa he ki swasthya upakentre kii jarurat he bhi yaa nahin
 The same is true of NRHM recruitments
 purvanchal ke ek jile ke siemo bataate hai ki enarechaem main badi sankhya main tainaati hone ke chalate ek baar phir siemo nishane par aa gaye hai
 Although the chairman of the selection process is DM, the leader is recommending the CMO
 prantiy chikitsa seva sangh kii mahasachiv dow
 Nirupama Singh says that the CMO is the weakest officer in the district and that is why all the people are targeting it
 ve kahati hai, ''sarkaar ko sabhi siemo ko suraksha deni chahie
 "the way money has been allocated in the Health Department in the last five years, it has immersed most cmos in the quagmire of corruption
" lekin gonda main jis tarah siemo par hamalaa hua, usne basapa sarkaar se alag dikhne ke sapa sarkaar ke daawey ko hi kathghare main khadaa kar diya he
 It basically refers to the illness of the Health Department
 saaf he ki sarkaar ko birdari, kshetravaad se upar uthakar achche adhikariyon par bharosa jataana hoga or nirankush mantriyon ke kaan khinchne honge
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached BJP headquarters on Sunday evening
 pradhanmantri kaa pad sanbhaalane ke baad bijepi mukhyalay kaa unka yah pehla daura tha
 Describing these Lok Sabha elections as the decisive point of the 21st century for the world, not just the country, today he said that if the BJP government acted with full devotion for the common citizens, then the people of the country would never break ties with it
 unhone kaha ki desh kii janata to 1967 main hi congress se vimukh ho chuki thi, lekin uske baad hue prayogon se niraash hokar vah vahiin (congress ke paas) mud kar chali gai
 Modi, who came to the BJP headquarters here for the first time after becoming the Prime Minister, said, "it becomes our responsibility that the public is 10 steps ahead of us, then let us see how to go step by step with it, how to conduct ourselves
" isse uskaa hamaare prati vishwaas badhegaa
 Modi said, “earlier elections used to discuss more caste equations than politics, but this is the first election in which the people have given the mandate by rising above all caste equations, geographical equations and other traditional equations
 ' unhone sawaal kiya ki yah koun si prerana or apeksha thi jo kashmir se lekar kanyakumari tak janata ko is bindu se jod rahi thi
 Giving the answer himself, he said, it was the election of 'public hope'
 modi ne kaha, 'isliye sarkaar or bijepi kaa daayitv banataa he ki ham janata kii aakankshaon par khare utren
 Do not miss any hard work

 To know what is a sound wave, learn important facts related to frequency waves, frequency of waves: Sound waves 1
 dhwani tarang anudaidhary yantric tarangen hoti hai
 2
 jin yantric tarangon kii aavriti 20hz se 2000hz ke bich hoti he, unki anubhuti hamen apane kaanon ke dwaara hoti he, or inhen ham dhwani ke naam se pukaarte hai
 Frequency Range of Sound Waves: (i) Infrasonic waves: Sound waves with a frequency below 20hz are called absorbance waves
 ise hamaara kaan nahin sun saktaa he
 Such waves can be generated from very large size sources
 (ii) shravy tarangen(audible waves): 20hz se 2000hz ke bich kii aavriti vaali tarangon ko shravy tarangen kehete hai
 Our ear can hear these waves
 (iii) parashravya tarangen (ultrasonic waves):2000hz se upar kii tarangon ko parashravya tarangen kaha jaataa he
 The ear of the sage cannot hear it
 parantu kuch jaanavar jaise :- kutta,billi,chamagadad aadi, ise sun sakate he
 These waves are generated by the vibrations of quartz crystals by the Galton whistle and by the method of pressure electrical effect
 in tarango kii aavriti bahut oonchi hone ke kaaran isamen bahut adhik urja hoti he
 Also, due to their small wavelengths, they can be sent far away as a thin beam

 Use of ultrasonic waves: (i) Sending signals (ii) Detecting the depth of the ocean (iii) Clearing precious cloth aircraft and clocks parts (iv) Removing soot from fireplaces (v) Destruction of harmful bacteria inside milk (vi) Treatment of arthritis and detection of brain tumors akshay kumaar film rustam main pahani apni uniform ko charity ke liye nilaam kar rahe hai
 But the debate has started
 yahaan tak ki akshay kii patni tvinkal khanna dhamkiyaan bhi milin
 She then said that she would take legal action against such people
 akshay ne bhi apni patni kaa saath dete hue is faisle par ade rahane kii baat kii
 Akshay met the media on the occasion of Labor Day
 is dauraan is maamle main unhone kaha kaha, sabase pehle to main is maamle main tvinkal ke saath khadaa hum
 My wife and i have done one thing with all my heart and have done it for goodness' sake
 ye meri film kaa costum tha, jo ki kisi achche kaary ke liye ja rahaa he
 The bid for the uniform worn in Akshay's Rustom reached so many crores, Akshay further said, 'I don't think we did anything wrong
 kisi ko agar bura lage to koi baat nahin
 i can do nothing for him
 ' akshay ne saaf taur par ye kaha ki ye sab kuch nek kaam ke liye kiya ja rahe he
 In such a situation, people should not object to this
 bataa den ki tvinkal ko sandip ahlavat naam ke ek shaks ne fasebuk par likhaa- main instagram par nahin hum isliye fasebuk par riplai kar rahaa hum
 For your NGO, the idea of auctioning your husband's clothes worn in the same way is the same nonsense as your funibane jokes, books and blogs
 uniform nilaam karne par dhamkee dene waalon ke khilaaf tvinkal karenge kanoonee karravivikal ne is post ke riplai main likhaa- samaaj ke taur par kya us mahila ko dhamkee dena sahi he jo charity ke liye uniform kii nilaamee karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 i will answer this through legal process

 Vivah Panchami is the main festival of Hindus
 puranic manyataon ke anusaar treta yug main isi din bhagwaan shri ram or mata sita kaa vivaah (ram Vivah) sampann hua tha
 This festival is especially celebrated in Nepal and Mithilanchal
 is dauraan gharon or mandiron main utsav manaaya jaataa he or ram va sita kaa paaramparik rup se gathbandhan kiya jaataa he
 There is also a tradition of reciting the Balakanda of Ramayana on this day
 swayamvar shuru hua or ek-ek kar sabhi raja, dhurandhar or rajkumaar aae lekin unamem se koi bhi shiv ke dhanash ko uthaanaa to dur use hilaa bhi nahin sakaa
 Seeing this, King Janaka became very sad and said that there is no eligible groom for my daughter
 tabhi maharishi vashishtha ne ram se swayamvar main hissaa lekar dhanush uthaane ke liye kaha
 Rama obeyed the Guru's command and picked up the bow at once and started offering it to him, but then the bow broke
 isi ke saath ram swayamvar jeet gaye or mata sita ne unke gale main varmala daal di
 It is believed that as soon as Sita put a garland around the neck of Rama, all the three people jumped with joy
 yahi vajah he ki vivaah panchami ke din aaj bhi dhoomdhaam se bhagwaan ram or mata sita kaa gathbandhan kiya jaataa he

 Coach Peter Moores was fired by the English Cricket Board after losing the Tests to the Ashes and West Indies
 cook ne kaha, 'donon series haar ke baad mujhe nahin pataa tha ki aage kya hoga or main aishez ke baad khel paaunga yaa nahin
 Nevertheless, as the captain of the England team, i wanted to play
 ' England have an unassailable 3–1 lead in the Ashes series from Australia
 aise main cook ne ab apana vichaar bhi badal diya he
 The 30-year-old cook said, "I was up in the morning thinking of winning the Ashes 4-1 and then thought of a series with Pakistan
 mere dimag main aayaa ki agar jeetna he to iske liye abhi se planning karnaa shuru kar dena chahie or main kuch or samay tak cricket khel saktaa hum
 Comments england ne aishez bhale hi jeet liya ho lekin khud captain kaa form sawaalon ke ghere main he
 In the current Ashes, Cook scored an innings of 96 runs in the Lord's Test, but his performance in the rest of the matches is not something special
 english captain ne australia ke kilaaf pichley chaar test main 31
 He has scored only 223 runs at an average of 85
 is dauraan unke balle se sirf ek ardhshtak niklaa
 It is clear that Cook, who has scored close to nine thousand runs in 118 Tests, will be expected to score a big knock in the Oval Test along with the team

 mana ja rahaa he congress is baar agar satta par kabiz hoti he to kamalnath yaa sindhiya main se hi ek mukhyamantri banegaa
 Born on 18 November 1946 in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, Kamal Nath did his schooling from the famous Doon School
 doon skool main unki jaan pahchaan congress ke diggaj netaa rahe sanjay gandhi se hui
 After studying from the Doon School, Kamal Nath earned a b from St
 Xavier's College, Kolkata
 com main snaatak kiya
 On 27 January 1973, Kamal Nath tied the knot with Alka Nath
 kamalnath ke do bete hai
 His elder son Nakulnath is active in politics
 34 saal kii umr main jeeta pehla chunaavkamalnath 9 baar loksabhaa ke liye chune ja chuke hai
 He won elections for the first time from Chhindwara in 1980 at the age of 34 which continues till now
 kamalnath 1985, 1989, 1991 main lagaataar chunaav jite
 From 1991 to 1995 he held the Ministry of Environment in the Narasimha Rao government
 vahiin 1995 se 1996 tak ve kapadaa mantri rahe
 Kamal Nath also won the 1998 and 1999 elections
 lagaataar jeet hasil karne se kamalnath kaa congress main kad badhata gaya or 2001 main unhen mahasachiv banaaya gaya
 He remained the General Secretary of the party till 2004
 chhindwara main to jeet kaa doosraa naam kamalnath ho gaye or 2004 main unhone ek baar phir jeet hasil kii

 He held this important ministry for the entire 5 years in the UPA-I government
 iske baad 2009 main chunaav hua or ek baar phir congress kaa yah diggaj netaa loksabhaa ke liye chunaa gaya
 This 'lotus' of the Congress continued to bloom in Chhindwara and this time the veteran leader in the Manmohan Singh government got the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways
 saal 2012 main kamalnath sansadeey kaarymantri bane
 The important responsibility for elections in Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath is counted among those Congress leaders who are always with the party even in times of crisis
 chaahe wo rajeev gandhi kaa nidhan ho, 1996 se lekar 2004 tak jis sankat se congress guzar rahi thi, is dauraan bhi vah party ke saath rahe wo bhi tab jab sharad pavaar jaise diggaj netaaon ne party kaa saath chhod diya tha
 He became the President of Madhya Pradesh Congress on 26 April 2018
 unhen arun yadav kii jagah adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 How came into politics Kamal Nath was born in Kanpur, studied in West Bengal and what happened was that Kamal Nath had to do politics from Madhya Pradesh
 darasal desh ke sabase bade raajnneetik parivaar se aane vaale sanjay gandhi kii dosti doon skool main pashchim bengal se aane vaale kamalnath se hui
 The friendship started from Doon School gradually became family
 doon skool se padhai karne ke baad kamalnath kolkata ke saint jevier college pahunche
 Though the city changed, the friendship of the two did not last long
 kamalnath purv piem indira gandhi ke daur se hi gandhi parivaar ke kareebi rahe hai
 Kamal Nath wanted to increase his business
 aise main ek baar phir doon skool ke ye donon dost phir kareeb aa gaye
 It is said that during the Emergency period, when the company of Kamal Nath was running in crisis, Sanjay Gandhi played an important role in removing it from it
 sanjay gandhi kii chhavi ek tej tarraar netaa ke taur par hoti thi
 Kamal Nath lived with this young son of Indira Gandhi all the time
 bade bete rajeev gandhi ko raajnneeti main aane kii ichha nahin thi
 In such a situation, Sanjay Gandhi needed to be together and he was Kamal Nath
 1975 main immergency ke baad se congress kharaab daur se guzar rahi thi
 Sanjay Gandhi had died prematurely during this period, Indira Gandhi's age was also not supporting her now
 congress lagaataar kamjor hoti gai
 Kamal Nath had come close to the Gandhi family, he was also working hard
 vah lagaataar party ke saath khadey hue the
 He was rewarded by Indira Gandhi when he was given a ticket from Chhindwara seat and cast in politics
 bas phir kya iske baad chhindwara kamalnath kaa ho gaya or kamalnath chhindwara ke

 This area has become the stronghold of Kamal Nath
 vah is seat par tab bhi jite jab 2014 main congress ne ab tak kaa apana sabase kharaab pradarshan kiya
 Chhindwara voters have disappointed Kamal Nath only once when they lost in 1997 to former CM Sundar Lal Patwa
 1996 main kamalnath kii jagah unki patni chunaav ladi thim or jeet mili thi

 ' sanathan dharm ko maanane vaale mata vaishno devi kii mahima gaate nahin thakte hai
 In our scriptures, along with chanting of gods and goddesses, stories are also said to be very useful for defeating the sufferings of the people in Kali-yuga
 sthaan or kaal main bhed kii vajah se kathaon main bhi kuch antar paae jate hai
 There should be true devotion in the mind, God blesses
 vaise tomata vaishno devise judi kai kathaayen hai, par jo katha sabase adhik prachlit he, vah aage di ja rahi he
 
 
 Vaishno Devi was pleased with the devotion of one of her devotees, Pandit Sridhar and saved her shame
 mata ne puure jagat ko apni mahima kaa bodh karaayaa
 Since then, people visit this pilgrimage site and get the blessings of Mother
 katra se kuch duuri par sthit hansaali gaanv main maa vaishnavi ke param bhakt shridhar rahete the
 He used to be sad due to being childless
 ek din unhone navaratri pujan ke liye kunvaari kanyaon ko bulawaaya
 Mother Vaishno sat among them in disguise as a girl
 pujan ke baad sabhi kanyaayein to chali gayi, par maa vaishno devi vahiin raheen or shridhar se boleen, ‘sabko apane ghar bhandare kaa nimantran de aao
 'sridhar agreed to that divine girl and sent the message of Bhandare to the surrounding villages
 vahaan se lautakar aate samay guru gorakhnath va unke shishy baba bhairavnath ji ke saath unke duusare shishyon ko bhi bhojan kaa nimantran diya
 All the villagers were surprised to get the invitation of food, which girl is she, who wants to get food to so many people? After this, many villagers came to Sridhar's house and gathered for food
 tab kanya rupi maa vaishno devi ne ek vicitra paatr se sabhi ko bhojan parosna shuru kiya
 While serving food, when the girl went to Bhairavnath, she said that i will eat meat instead of kheer-puri and drink alcohol
 tab kanya rupi maa ne use samajhaayaa ki yah brahman ke yahaan kaa bhojan he, isamen maansaahaar nahin kiya jaataa
 But Bhairavnath deliberately kept his point
 jab bhairavnath ne us kanya ko pakadana chaha, tab maa ne uske kapat ko jaan liya
 Mother changed into air and flew towards Trikuta mountain
 bhairavnath bhi unke peeche gaya
 It is believed that there was also Pawanaputra Hanuman to protect the mother
 hanumanji ko pyaas lagane par mata ne unke aagrah par dhanush se pahaad par baan chalaakar ek jaldhara nikaali or us jal main apane kesh dhoe
 Today this sacred stream is known as Banganga
 iske pavitra jal ko pine yaa isamen snaan karne se shraddhaluon kii sari thakaavat or takaliphen dur ho jaati hai
 During this, Mata entered a cave and meditated for nine months
 bhairavnath bhi unke peeche vahaan tak aa gaya
 Then a monk told Bhairavnath that the one whom you are considering as a girl is Adishakti Jagadamba, so give up the pursuit of that superpower
 bhairavnath ne sadhu kii baat nahin maani
 Mata then made her way out of the cave to the other side
 yah gupha aaj bhi ardhkumari yaa adikumari yaa garbhajun ke naam se prasiddh he
 The step mother of the first mother of Ardhkumari is also Paduka
 yah vah sthaan he, jahaan mata ne bhaagate-bhaagate mudakar bhairavnath ko dekha tha
 Out of the cave, the girl assumed the form of a goddess
 mata ne bhairavnath ko chetaya or waapas jane ko kaha
 Still he did not agree
 mata gupha ke bheetar chali gayi
 Then Hanumanji was outside the cave to protect Mata and he fought with Bhairavnath
 bhairav ne phir bhi haar nahin maani
 When the heroic langur began to wilt, Mata Vaishnavi took the form of Mahakali and killed Bhairavnath
 bhairavnath kaa sir katkar bhawan se 8 kimi dur trikut parvat kii bhairav ghati main gira
 That place is known as the temple of Bhaironath
 jis sthaan par maa vaishno devi ne hathi bhairavnath kaa vadh kiya, vah sthaan pavitra gupha athwa bhawan ke naam se prasiddh he
 At this place, Maa Mahakali (right), mother Mahasaraswati (middle) and mother Mahalakshmi (left) are sitting in the cave as Pindi
 in teenon ke sammilat rup ko hi maa vaishno devi kaa rup kaha jaataa he
 It is said that after his slaughter, Bhairavnath repented of his mistake and begged for forgiveness from his mother
 mata vaishno devi jaanati thim ki un par hamalaa karne ke peeche bhairav kii pramukh manshaa moksh praapt karne kii thi
 Not only did he liberate Bhairava from the cycle of rebirth, but gave him a boon, saying that my darshan would not be considered complete unless a devotee would visit you after me
 usee manyata ke anusaar aaj bhi bhakt mata vaishno devi ke darshan karne ke baad kareeb paune teen kilometre kii khadi chadhaai karke bhairavnath ke darshan karne jate hai
 Meanwhile, Vaishno Devi assumed the shape of a rock with three bodies (head) and meditated forever
 is bich pandit shridhar adheer ho gaye
 They headed the same way towards the Trikuta mountain, which they had dreamed of, finally they reached the entrance to the cave
 unhone kai vidhiyon se pindon kii puja ko apni dincharya bana lee
 Devi was pleased with his worship
 ve unke saamne prakat huin or unhen aashirwad diya
 Since then Sridhar and his descendants have been worshiping the goddess Maa Vaishno Devi
 aaj bhi barhon maas vaishno devi ke darbar main bhakton kaa tantaa laga rahata he

 Till now, you must have held Pakistan responsible for infiltration and situation in Kashmir
 lekin india today or ajtak kii yah exclusive report aapkaa najariya badal degi
 You will be surprised to know that Kashmir today is more threatened by China than Pakistan
 china pakistan iconomic coridor yani CPEC ke jo dastavej india today ko haath lage hai use dekhakar aapako yakeen ho jayega ki aaj kashmir ke maamle main pakistan china ke mohare se zyada kuch nahin
 Indeed, this statement of Mehbooba Mufti was then taken by some people as a shield to hide their weakening grip on the law and order of Jammu and Kashmir
 lekin mahabuuba sach bol rahi thim
 China is desperately trying to capture Kashmir through Pakistan
 hamaara kamajarf padosi iske liye china kii gulaami karne ko taiyaar he
 Taking advantage of this, China is investing indiscriminately in Pak Occupied Kashmir
 china kii van belt van road niti kaa bharat pehle bhi virodh kar chukaa he
 This road passes through Pakistan occupied Kashmir and aims to increase its penetration in Kashmir, but China is not ready to stop
 bharat se badhati khunnas ko ham arunachal or bhutan tak simit samajhate rahe
 But Aaj Tak has got some such documents of the Chinese government, after seeing which the lines of concern get crooked, after seeing which the Government of India will also get upset
 jinhen dekhne ke baad china se kisi bhaichaare or dosti kii bachi-khuchi ummiden bhi tut jaaengi
 Together with Pakistan, he is playing a game after which Pakistan will become a puppet of China which will have to dance at the behest of Beijing and all this is happening to occupy Kashmir
 china ne baqayada 20 saal kaa ek blueprint taiyaar kiya he
 In these twenty years China will occupy Pakistan's agriculture
 urja sanyantron ko apane haath main le legaa
 Will take over the textile industry
 rashtriya rajmargon ko apane haath main le legaa or to or stock exange ko bhi niyantrit karne lagegaa
 NDA MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar says, "china knows that POK is dispensed
" china agar vahaan madad karata he to usko hi vahaan nuksaan hoga, kyonki bharat hameshaa hi clem karata he ki POK hamaara he
 China has realized that India will not compromise on its interests
 'matlab china ne kashmir main ghuspaith ke liye pakistan kii aarthik chaabi apane haath main lene kii puri taiyaari kar lee he, or iske liye wo vahaan har saal arabon dollar kaa nivesh kar rahaa he
 China's government is executing this game in a very vicious way
 jaish-e-mohammad ke aatanki masood ajahar ko antarrashtriya aatankwaadi ghoshit karne ke bharat ke abhiyaan par sanyukt raashtra main vito karke china ne apane khoonkhaar iraadon kaa pardaa utaar diya he
 JDU leader Sharad Yadav said on this issue, "it is not hidden from anyone that China is fully investing in Pakistan and is trying to strengthen it
 hamaari videsh niti kii vifaltaa he ki aaj hamaare saath china pakistan nepal se lekar kisi bhi padosi desh se sambandh bahut achche nahin hai
 "let me tell you that the National Development and Reform Commission of China has prepared this blueprint to surround India
 or to or pakistan ke yojana ayog ne is blue print ko manjuuri di he
 Renmin University of Beijing has assessed this blue print
 sab jaanate hai ki nau gyaarah ke twin tower hamale ke baad america ne aatankwaad ke masale ko lekar pakistan ko kade tevar dikhaae hai
 China bridged this distance from America to Pakistan and took advantage of its bankruptry and entered its border
 is ghuspaith kaa nateeja ye hua ki 2007 main pakistan ke saath china kaa jo kaarobaar 4 arab dollar kaa tha wo 2016 main 14 arab dollar kaa ho gaya
 Meaning the chinese-pak business has more than tripled in ten years
 pakistan main kul epadiai main se 40 fisadi hissaa aaj akele china kaa ho chukaa he
 The whole world is aware of the Chinese help getting Pakistan's nuclear programs
 lekin ab use itane se tasalli nahin he
 India's growing credibility on the world stage and emerging stature as a global power has made China so restless that it is bent on making Pakistan a colony by any means
 or pakistan bharat se apni nafrat kii sanak main apni barbaadi kaa swaagat kar rahaa he

 in / After 41 demonetisation passes, small traders seem to be more aware of cashless arrangements than government institutions
 'ajtak' kii team jab dilli ke itio main reality check karne pahunchi, to ek choti dukaan main cashles pement ke intjaam dekhakar hairaan rah gai
 Pankaj and Mohsin, who have been running photocopy, form filling and passport size photo shop right in front of the ITK passport office for the past several years, have made cashless payments
 is dukaan main passport banavaane ke liye aavedan bharne ke liye 1700 rupee fees deni hoti he, jo log internet yaa cash kii killat kii vajah se ye kaam nahin kar pate hai, wo yahaan jarur aate hai
 Arranged for online banking, Pankaj said that Paytm was installed only after 4 days of Kinotbandi, because there was a lot of problem about open notes and cash
 iske alaava unhone apni dukaan main online banking kaa intjaam bhi kiya he
 Calculated Benefits of Paytm Mohsin calculates the benefits of Paytm and says that through this, you transfer money between Rs
 2 to Rs
 200
 haalanki, kai aise log bhi dukaan main aate hai, jinke paas cash nahin hota or sirf debit yaa credit card hota he
 Mohsin told that to deal with this problem, he is going to buy swipe machine
 sarkarnotbandike baad zyada se zyada cashles tranjection par jor de rahi he
 Small traders have started on the path of cashless, but the attitude of adopting cashless in government institutions seems to be very loose

 Due to this crisis, millions of people of the country are expected to get displaced and the country's oil production will be affected
 is baat kii bhi ashanka he ki suraksha bal baghdad main charampanthiyon kaa makul jawaab nahin de sakenge

 On Monday, the Modi cabinet spoke of giving 10 per cent reservation to economically weaker upper castes
 ye aarakshan sarkari naukari or shiksha ke kshetra main diya jayega
 This is not the first time in the politics of the country when a government has announced to give reservation, it has completely changed its stand

 OBC recommendations were rejected
 1963 -supreme court ne kaha tha ki aamtaur par 50 fisadi se zyada aarakshan nahin diya ja saktaa he
 The backward classes are divided into three categories Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Other Backward Classes (OBC)
 1976 –anusoochiyon main sanshodhan kiya gaya
 1979 - Mandal Commission was formed to evaluate the status of socially-educationally backward
 1980 –mandal kamishan ne kota main badlaav karte hue 22 fisadi ko 49
 Recommended to carry up to 5 per cent
 jiske baad lambey samay tak is par raajnneeti chalati rahi
 1990 - The recommendations of the Mandal Commission were implemented by the then VP Singh government in government jobs
 iske khilaaf deshbhar main pradarshan hua, is dauraan dilli uniwarsity ke chaatr rajeev goswami ne aatmadah kiya
 1991 - Narsimha Rao government gave 10% reservation for the forward castes separately, but the Supreme Court termed the decision as non-constitutional
 2006 -centre sarkaar ne shiksha kshetra main bhi anya pichhadaa varg waalon ke liye aarakshan dene kii shuruyaat kii
 2014 - The UPA government included Jats in the list of central obcs

 com / raprxnokcl Actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan says that she has no qualms about not working in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film 'bajirao Mastani'
 pehle is film main aishwarya kaam karne vaali thim
 Bhansali wanted to cast Salman and Aishwarya in the lead roles in 'bajirao Mastani' after the immense success of his 1999 film Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam
 film main ab ye bhoomikaayen ranbir singh or deepika padukon nibhaa rahe hai
 When asked about this film, Aishwarya said, from the beginning of the film (bajirao Mastani), he wanted to get special actors
 agar vaisaa hota
 
 
 So you all know that i would have become 'mastani' as per his wish, but this would have happened if the actor he had thought (pointing to Salman) would become Bajirao
 tippaniyan He said, but it did not happen, then we openly talked about it
 yah aisi cheez nahin he jise lekar sochaa jaae
 
 
 To be worried har film kii apni niyati hoti he or vah vahiin pahunchati he, jahaan jane ke liye bani hoti he
 Aishwarya will now be seen in Sanjay Gupta's film Jazbaa after a gap of five years
 aishwarya, bhansaali ke saath do hit filmon ‘ham dil de chuke sanam’ or ‘devdas’ main kaam kar chuki hai
 Talking about his relationship with Bhansali, he said, 'my close association with him and this is why we share a close personal relationship
 kuch filmkaaron ke saath mere sambandh vyaktigat rup se majboot hai or yah keval kaam ko lekar nahin he
 ' bhansaali 1999 main ai apni film 'ham dil de chuke sanam' kii apaar safalataa ke baad 'bajirao mastaani' main salmaan or aishwarya ko mukhya bhoomikaaon main lenaa chaahate the
 The film now stars Ranbir Singh and Deepika Padukone
 is film ke bare main puche jane par aishwarya ne kaha, film (bajirao mastaani) kii shuruyaat se hi vah khaas kalakaaron ko lenaa chaahate the
 If it were like that
 
 
 to aap sab ko pataa he ki unki ichha ke mutabik main 'mastaani' banati, lekin aisa tabhi hota agar unke dwaara sochaa gaya abhinayta (salmaan kii taraf ishaara karte hue) bajirao banataa
 The comments unhone kaha, lekin aisa nahin hua phir hamane khulkar is bare main baat kii
 This is not something to be thought about
 
 
 chintaa kii jaae
 Every film has its own destiny and it reaches where it is made to go
 aishwarya paanch saal ke antaraal ke baad ab sanjay gupta kii film 'jajba' main najar aaengi
 Aishwarya has worked with Bhansali in two hit films 'hum Dil De Chuke Sanam' and 'devdas'

 The villagers claim that they had given all their information accurately, but when Aadhar card was made and reached them, they were surprised to see the date of birth recorded on January 1
 gaanv waalon ne jab aadhaar card banane vaali company ke thekedaar se sampark karnaa chaha to wo nahin mila

 To strengthen the transport system in the country's capital, the Aam Aadmi Party government has started a 'common Mobility Card'
 jisase dilli vaale metro, ditisi or cluster bason main ek hi card se safar kar paaenge
 CM Arvind Kejriwal gave the green signal to travel with 'common Mobility Card' in 200 and 50 cluster buses of DTC
 dilli main ditisi kii 3900 se zyada or cluster kii 1600 basen hai jinamein lakhon log rojaanaa safar karte hai
 At the same time, the number of people traveling in Delhi metro is lakhs

 Transport Minister Kailash Gehlot claims that the 'common Mobility Card' can be used from April 1 in all Delhi's DTC and cluster buses
 'ajtak' kii team ne parivahan mantri kailash gahalot ke saath ditisi bas main safar kar 'kaaman mobility card' kaa rielity check bhi kiya
 During the journey from Delhi Secretariat to Rajghat, Gehlot said that the conductor will have an electronic ticketing machine
 bas main chadhate samay 5, 10 yaa 15 rupee kaa jo bhi tikat lenaa he yah bataakar conductor ko metro kaa smart card dena hoga
 As soon as the card is placed on the screen of the electronic machine, the money will be deducted from the card and the ticket slip will come out
 metro smart card main magnetic strip hota he or prayek card kaa ek number hota he, yah number ditisi ke tikat par bhi darj hoga
 Apart from this, Minister Rajendra Gautam also boarded the DTC bus with 'aaj Tak' correspondent
 gautam ne bataaya ki 'kaaman mobility card' kii vajah se bason main khule rupee kii samasya puri tarah se khatm ho jaaegi
 However, to recharge the balance of the card, one has to turn to the DTC bus depot where monthly passes of buses are made or balance can be recharged from the metro station counter

 com / hjnqdjwkib The first railway budget of the Narendra Modi government was presented
 tamaam lubhaavni baton or vaadon ke saath is bajet main janata ko tikaton ke daam main badhotaree se baksh diya gaya kyonki vah pehle hi bad chuke the
 PM Modi's dear dream of running a bullet train is also in this budget
 iske alaava relon kii speed badhaane kii yojanaayen bhi hai
 Passengers will be very comfortable due to high speed trains running on nine routes
 iske alaava bhi rail chatushkon main bhi tej raftaar trainen chalaane kii bhi baat kahi gai he
 Its implementation will be very difficult for the railways facing financial crisis as the Railway Minister himself has admitted that hundreds of projects for railway expansion and betterment are pending
 kuch pariyojnaayen to 4 se 30 varsh se bhi lambey samay se lataki padi hai
 It is evident that the Railways needs lakhs of crores of rupees to fulfill them, which it does not have
 railway inhen kaise puraa karegi yah shaayad agle bajet main hi pataa chalegaa
 But it is a good thing that the Railway Minister has opened the way for private investment in Railways and has also cleared FDI
 isse dhan jutanaa aasaan hoga kyonki rail tikaton ko bechakar nai yojanaon ko puraa nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 It is also a matter of deep satisfaction that the Railways have started thinking seriously in this direction
 do karod 30 lakh logon ko har din unke gantavy tak pahunchane vaali bhartiya rail ko sahare kii sakht jarurat he
 The Railways is able to save only 6 paise per rupee from its operations, so that its future plans cannot be met
 ise kisi vanijyik sanghathan kii tarah chalaane kii aavashyaktaa he or is baton ko rail mantri ne mana he
 Without this, it will be difficult to get the highest employment organization in the country to stand on its own feet
 railway ko gatiman rakhane ke liye yah jaruri he ki usamen nayaa rakt bharaa jaae jo sirf bade paimaane ke nivesh se hi sambhav hoga
 The problem is that the number of poor people who travel by rail from all classes is very high, who cannot afford to increase the prices of tickets
 isliye videshi dhan laane or railway main nivesh kii ore rail mantri ko or sochna he
 As far as the bullet train is concerned, PM Modi himself is taking initiative for it
 rail mantri ne railway kii do mahatvapurn chizon par dhyaan dekar badhiya kaam kiya he
 The biggest problem of the railways is safety and then cleanliness
 in donon ke bare main unhone kai kadamon kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Safety of trains and passengers is very important and for this they have announced concrete steps
 duusari ore safai ke liye profeshnal agenciyon kii sevaayen lene kii baat bhi acchhee he
 This is good news for passengers as most trains have a major cleaning problem
 trainon or steshnon kii saaf-safai ko badhanaa jaruri he or iske liye railway ke paas tantra nahin he
 Now working with professional agencies will solve this problem to a great extent
 lekin logon ko bhi apni jimmedaari samajni hogi
 In order to improve the catering system in Railways, the Railway Minister has also said to take recourse to private companies
 unka yah prastaav ki jane-maane restaraan chen ko iske liye joda jayega
 At present, passengers are not satisfied with the food and railways and they want to improve it
 isse rail kii shaan bhi badhegi or logon ko bhi suvidha hogi
 Railway Minister could not stop his temptation to run new trains and he has also announced 58 new trains
 isamen paanch premium trainen hai jinase railway ko dhan mil sakegaa
 But it would have been better to focus on the operation of old trains instead of so many new trains because even today hundreds of trains are running late
 baharhaal itnaa hi kaha ja saktaa he ki manzil abhi dur he or rasta jatil he
 In the US, a 66-year-old father was allegedly killed by a hammer when a man of Indian origin made a comment about playing puzzle
 vinayak shanbagh naamak 33 varshiya is vyakti ko giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 According to the Deton Beach News Journal news, the man repeatedly hit his father Panduran Shanbag's head with a hammer weighing around 10 pounds while he was sleeping

 According to the police, Vinayak told that he and his father were playing a puzzle that the father said something to which he had been arrested
 reshaan ho gaya
 He kept thinking overnight and then decided to attack the father

 The project is expected to be completed by 2011
 pariyojna kii laagat 600 karod rupavijayan ne kaha ki isse elisi kahin bhi kabhi bhi seva de sakegi
 The project was launched in 2007

 He said that the cost of this project for eight years is Rs 600 crore
 elisi ke polisydharakon kii sankhya 23 karoddeshbhar main elisi ke polisydharakon kii sankhya 23 karod he

 Research results show that as the weather changes, the mood of a human being also changes
 vaivaahik jivan main bhi yah baat lagu hoti he
 In the winter season, sexual desire increases more than in the second season
 kuch aasaan upaay karke ise or zyada khushnuma banaaya ja saktaa he
 Here 5 very important things are discussed
 
 
 1
 Take full care of your clothes Take care of your clothes during the play
 behad kam yaa bina kapadon ke shaareerik sambandh kaayam karnaa musiibat kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 You should take care of your mood as well as room temperature
 2
 Never forget to take a bath in cold
 Sometimes people avoid bathing immediately due to excess cold
 jinhen taalane kii aadat ho jaati he, ve ise ek-do din se lekar hafte tak taal dete hai, jo sehat ke khyal se acchhee baat nahin he
 It is important for health to bathe in lukewarm water every day
 agar is kaam main zyada romaanch paidaa karnaa chaahate hai to apane life partner ko bhi bath tub main bhi partner bana sakate hai
 You will not be able to forget this feeling even after winter
 3
 Maintain distance from alcohol
 It has been observed that as the winter season starts, the consumption of alcohol increases more than double compared to other seasons
 kai logon kaa maananaa he ki ve sharaab kaa seven karke sardiyon kaa behatar dhang se muqabla kar sakate hai
 This thinking is not good
 aisi chijen chhodkar aap apane partner ke saath garmjoshi se baaten karen or ek-duusare ko pyaar-bhari garmaahat kaa ehsaas karavaaen
 Try to make up for the lack of alcohol by kissing and hugging
 isse pyaar main hi ijapha hoga
 4
 raat ke vakt zyada bhojan na karenraat kaa bhojan 9 baje se pehle kar len, to behatar
 Excess food can increase laziness, and this can deprive you of sexual pleasure despite the desire to sleep
 bhojan main hari patteedaar subjiyan, saag, tamaato, mul, gaajar aadi jarur len
 You can also eat things like Chyawanprash
 5
 People do not do as much physical work as is necessary due to the morning walk and exercise
 thand ke maare log morning walk va eksrasij ko bhi aksar taal dete hai
 This is not fair
 sardiyon main sehat ke liye or swasth vaivaahik jivan ke liye yah behad jaruri he ki eksrasij kiya jaae
 This increases the desire for sex and maintains the enjoyment of life

 Now the Muslim Personal Law Board has been killed
 jabaki sabakuch saaf ho chukaa he wo teen talaak ko lekar puri tarah hathiyaar daalane ko taiyaar nahin he
 The board has called a meeting on 10 September
 haalanki usne kaum ke mardon ke naam apil jari kii he ki aap adaalat ke hukum kii taamil kiijie

 pehali to wo naaballig hote hue hi maa ban gai or duusari usne is galati ko chupaane ke liye apane navjaat bachche ko maar daalaa
 Actually, this is the story of a girl studying in class 10 in a government school in Andhra Pradesh
 usne mangalvaar subah ko apane hostal main ek bachche ko janm diya
 She was so scared that she threw the newborn out of the bathroom window and the newborn died while undergoing treatment in the hospital

 The girl was married to her aunt's son

 The girl returned to her hostel after the holidays

 The warden would have made an excuse for illness if he had asked anything

 The shocking thing was that even the nurse at the hostel did not get a clue of it during the health checkup

 ram rahim singh jor dekar kehete hai ki unke khilaaf lagaae gaye aarope jhuthe hai
 They point to a "conspiracy" by alcohol and drug gangs and their political masters, who, according to them, are losing their business as a result of the Dera Sacha Sauda's campaigns against alcohol and drugs
 dere ke daavon ke anusaar, 1990 main ram rahim singh ke gaddi sanbhaalane ke baad se deraa ‘‘kareeb paanch karod logon ko sharaab or nashili dawaaon ke changul se chhudaa chukaa he

 Apparently, the fast-growing Dera Sacha Sauda community, which has considerable influence in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, has brought all kinds of leaders to Ram Rahim Singh's door in so many years, every leader asks for his blessings, and Everybody wants to be their favorite before the election
 haalanki deraa pramukh jor dekar kehete hai ki unhone kabhi bhi kisi vishesh netaa yaa rajnatik party ke paksh main vot karne ke liye apane anuyaayiyon ko nirdeshit nahin kiya he, iske baavjood dere kii rajnatik shakha-saadh sangat rajnatik-hameshaa hi kisi bhi vidhansabha yaa loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle pasandida rajnatik disha kaa ek spasht sanket bhejti he
 Similarly, just a few days before voting in the Haryana Assembly elections this year, the political wing of Dera Sacha Sauda announced its support to the BJP
 aisa tab hua, jab party ke haryana chunaav prabharee kailash vijayawargeey ne bijepi ke 40 ummidavaaron ke saath deraa pramukh se mulaakaat kii
 It is also significant that Prime Minister Narendra Modi also publicly praised the cleanliness campaigns of the Dera Sacha Sauda during an election speech in Narnaund before the decision to support the saffron party
 ram rahim singh kehete hai, shshlekin ham hameshaa un logon ke saath rahe hai, jo safai or saamaajik buraaiyon ke unmoolan ke liye patibaddh hote hai

 ham log saal main hone vaale keval do navaratri ke bare main jaanate hai, caitra yaa vaasantik navaratri or asina yaa sharadiya navaratri
 Apart from this, there are two more Navratras in which special wishes are attained
 kam logon ko iskaa gyaan hone ke kaaran yaa iske chhipe hue hone ke kaaran isko gupt navaratri kehete hai
 Let me tell you, Secret Navratri comes twice a year - in Magh Shukla Paksha and Asad Shukla Paksha
 is prakaar kul milakar varsh main chaar navaratri hote hai
 All four are celebrated during the Navratri season
 mahakaal samhita or tamaam shakt granthon main in chaaron navaratri kaa mahatv bataaya gaya he
 In these, worship and rituals are performed to fulfill a particular desire and achieve fulfillment
 is baar asadha maheene kii gupt navaratri 13 july se 21 july tak rahegi
 What amazing coincidence, made after 21 years, on Amavasya, is this difference between normal and secret Navaratri? - vahiin gupt navaratri main zyaadaatar tantric puja kii jaati he
 - In Gupta Navaratri, usually there is not much publicity, its practice is kept confidential
 - gupt navaratri main puja or manokamana jitani zyada gopneey hogi, safalataa utani hi zyada milegi
 What will be the method of worshiping the mother in Gupta Navaratri? - Kalash can be established for nine days
 - agar kalash kii sthapana kii he to donon vela mantra jaap,chalisa yaa saptshati kaa paath karnaa chahie
 - It will be good to perform aarti both times
 - maa ko donon vela bhoga bhi lagaaein, sabase saral or uttam bhoga he laung or bataasha
 - Red flower is best for mother, but do not offer mud, madar, dube and basil to mother
 - puure nau din apana khan paan or aahaar satvik rakhen
 Learn, what is the importance of Tulsi plant and its benefits Mahaprayoga of Gupta Navratri - Put a red cloth on a wooden post
 - us par maa kii murti yaa pratikruti kii sthapana karen
 - Light a large lamp of Ghee in front of the mother
 - praatah or saayam maa ke vishisht mantra kaa 108 baar jaap karen
 - The mantra will be - "oon and Hri klein Chamundayee vichche" - Pray for your wish fulfillment

 ’’ Saudi Arabia has now adopted the policy of intervening in other countries
 german khufia agency 'bndi' kii report ke mutabik 29 saal ke dipti crown prince mohammad bin salmaan ke aane se saudi kii raajnneeti badal gai he
 The BND submitted a one-and-a-half-page report on Saudi's new aggressive policy at the end of last year
 jisamen bataaya gaya tha ki kis tarah saudi ke raksha mantri or dipti crown prince mohammad bin salmaan yaman or syria main chhadam yuddh ke jariye arab deshon main asthirataa kaa maahaul bana rahe hai
 Mohammed bin Salman is the son of King Salman
 khufia agency ko fatkaramtaur par khufia agenciyaan aisi reporton ko saarvajanik nahin karti jo raajnneetik taur par uthal-puthal machaa de
 But this report has openly criticized the close and powerful ally of the country, Saudi Arabia
 agency ne bade str par isse jude parche logon main baante hai
 The German Foreign Ministry has also reprimanded the agency after stating strong opposition from Saudi Arabia
 apratyaashit he saudi kaa ravaiyngreji akhbaar 'da independent' main chhapi khabar ke mutabik bndi report kaa germany ke baahar na ke baraabar asar hua he
 This is because at the time this report was published, the Paris terror attack was overshadowed in the international media
 lekin bndi kii report is ore ishaara karti he kisaudiarab ek apratyaashit niti kaa paalan kar rahaa he
 The biggest example of this is the withdrawal of all state relations with Iran
 report main king salmaan kii mahatvakanksha ko khatarnaak bataaya gaya he
 The policy changed after the death of King Abdullah, early this year, with the Shia religious leader al-nimr, 46 people were hanged by the Saudis
 saudi ne sunni muslim bahul deshon ko apni taraf karne kii koshish kii
 Saudi Arabia's move was seen as an open challenge to the leadership of Iran
 report ke mutabik ateet main saudi ne saamanytah apane sabhi vikalp khule rakhane kii koshish kii he
 Even if there were differences with some of his countries, he did not get into it, but since the death of King Abdullah in January last year, Saudi politics has taken a turn
 syria, yaman ke khilaaf aakraamak nitibndi ne apni report main un deshon ke naam bhi bataae hai, jinke khilaaf saudi ne aakraamak or ladaaku rukh apanaaya he
 According to the report, early last year, the Saudis extended their support to several military groups
 pehle saudi ne al-kaayda se jude al-nusra front or ahraar al-shaam kaa saath diya
 It won many wars against the Syrian army
 yaman main saudi main bhi ugravadi samooh hooti par hamale jari rakhe hue he
 The situation of war will not come from Iran
 It has been seen in some time that Saudi is deliberately increasing tension in relations with Iran
 lekin 'da iconomist' ko die ek intervyuu main prince mohammad salmaan ne iran ke saath yuddh kii ashanka ko khaarij kar diya
 He said that the war between Saudi and Iran would prove to be overwhelming for the world
 isliye ham bharosa dilaate hai ki aisa kuch nahin hoga
 Injury report of aggression is inexperienced, saying that although King Salman's aggressive strategies have not given him much success, he is getting a lot of support in his country
 bndi ne yah bhi chetavanee di he ki agar saudi kii sari takat mohammad ke haath aa jaati he to sthiti or bhi bigadegi
 Prince Mohammad Salman's arrogance is known to all the surrounding countries

 He was involved in the trinity with Kishore and Rafi in the 60–70s

 Mukesh was fond of singing since childhood

 But in the meantime, there was a coincidence that brought him to the list of the biggest singers in the film industry
 27 agast, 1976 ko yues main unka nidhan ho gaya
 Telling some stories related to his life on his death anniversary
 aise mila filmon main gane kaa maukamukesh kii badi bahan sangeet kii shiksha leti thim or mukesh bade chaav se unhen suna karte the
 One of his distant relatives was the famous actor Motilal

 After completing the recording of the song 'chanchal Nirmal Sheetal' from Raj Kapoor's film 'satyam Shivam Sundaram', Mukesh went to perform in a concert in the US, where he died of a heart attack on 27 August 1976
 raaj kapur ko jab unki maut kii khabar mili to unke munh se aawaaj bhi nahin nikali thi
 It is as if someone has taken away Raj's life
 media report ke mutabik ek intervyuu main raaj ne kaha tha mukesh ke jane se meri aawaaj or aatma donon chali gai
 Former cricketer and MP Kirti Azad has wished Gurmehar Kaur for the test
 apane bhavuk twit or uske baad ajtak se baatcheet main kirti ne kaha, mere ghar main bitiyaa nahin he, lekin main chahta hum ki agar beti ho to sherni gurmeher jaisi honi chahie
 Kirti Azadne said that Gurmehar had put 32 placards on his Facebook, but people saw only one and cut the ruckus on it
 do saal kii umr main apane pita ko kho dene ke baad uski manasthiti ko kisi ne samajhane kii koshish nahin kii
 This is unfortunate
 ajtak se baat karte samay ankhon main utar aae aansuon ke kataron ko chhupate hue kirti aaazaad ne kaha ki mere ghar main bete to hai, lekin beti naa hone se main samaj nahin paa rahaa hum ki beti ko imtihaan ke liye shubhakamanaayen kaise duun
 But I'm with him
 raajnneeti karne waalon ne uski bhaawanaaon ke saath ganda majaak kiya he
 Comparing himself to Gurmehar, Kirtik says, 'I can understand his feelings
 main asambaddha saansad hum
 That is also because I, like my father, kept the habit of telling the truth to the truth and false to the lie
 iskaa khamiyaja maine to bhugta hi saath hi gurmeher ko bhi bhugatna padaa
 "with this, he said, the matter is to write politics in a derisive manner, to make fun of a person with less emotion and to mean anything of his own free will
 ye kisi bhi surat main uchit nahin he
 i strongly condemn all such people and wish Gurmehar well
 meri shubhakamanaayen hai kigurmeharpadhai ke imtihaan ke saath hi jindagi ke imtihaan main bhi awwal aae
 'let me tell you that after the clash between students of ABVP and Left Students' Unions at Ramjas College in Delhi, Gurmehar expressed his views on social media through placards

 It also reportedly received rape threats

 Ajit Vadnerkar is a journalist by profession, but his ability to crawl the history-geography-structure of words changes his introduction
 vah ise shabdon ke aise durgam shikhar tak le jaati he jahaan kalam ke sipaahi jane se ghabaraate hai
 The third part of the journey of Vadnekar's books is in our hands
 is siries ke bare main sheersh aalochak dow
 Namwar Singh has rightly said that "it is easy to make a man's horoscope, it is very difficult to make a horoscope of words
" kaise paidaa hue, kab paidaa hue, yah jaananaa-khojna bada mushkil kaam he
 In such an environment when journalism is leaving the language, i am happy that Vadnerkar took this responsibility
 dhun ke pakke hai
 a Marathi speaking man has prepared this dictionary, which is a challenge for us Hindi people
 ''vadnerkar kisi bhi samasamyik shabd ke paas thaharte hai, use tatolte hai or phir kabhi patrkaar, kabhi bhashavid to kabhi ek samaajavigyaani ke nazariye se uskaa aagaa-peechha khojate-khangalate hai
 They go into detail as long as a common avid reader remains interested
 masalan, masakhra shabd par unki tip dekhieru yah arabi ke maskhar shabd se bana he or barasta farsi-urdu hote hue aayaa he
 In Hindi, it means jester or laughing person
 lekin maskhar kaa matlab acchhee-bhalee shakl kaa bighad janaa he
 With Arab merchants, the term reached Maschera, reaching Spain and Italy
 french main mascurair hua jiskaa matlab chehre ko rangane se he
 In English its form was masked
 madhyakaal main masakhra mechap or cosmetics kii duniya main pahunchaa or iskaa roopaantar muskara ho gaya
 In this work, the check-in vision of the journalist of Vadnekar is constantly active
 tabhi to shabd samoohon ke sheershakon tak main unhone pathneeyata or saundaryabodh kaa kchayaal rakhaa he
 See specimens: ointment before ointment (word reference: ointment, malham, ointment, mahroom, vacant); Puffing up of foket (fokat, blowing, blowing, hiss); Scurrying and manure making (dung, palid, lendi, marrow); The fare is the rent and the hook
 jarurat padane par vadnerkar vistaar dene se bhi nahin ghabaraate
 Tracing the roots of a colloquial word Jhandubam, he goes to four pages and also exposes the contradiction of its meaning
 muhaavarey kaa darja paa chuke is shabd kaa arth murkh, bhondu yaa bekaar vyakti se he
 They say that in Hindi Shabdasagar is the word Jhandula which means a child who has not been shaved since birth
 lekin jhand karnaa muhaavarey ke aasapaas bhi yah maayna nahin pahunchataa
 The author has explained here that removing hair from the head means both erudition and stupidity
 isi tarah ve cameraa shabd ko pakadte hai, europe se aayaa or vahaan kii anya bhashaaon se milte hue commered kii utpatti bhi isi se hui jiskaa arth saathi he
 But colloquially it is used for a person with rationalistic views
 184 adhyyon vaale is tisare padaav ke baad chauthe kii taiyaari chal rahi he
 It is really interesting to know the changing sounds of words and their use over time

 He told that he is the original script writer of the film, he himself first went to Imran Khan with the offer of the film
 lekin unhone biji shedul kii vajah se film karne se manaa kar diya tha
 The special thing is that at that time Vipul was talking to Prerna Arora to produce the film and wanted to direct the film himself
 iske baad vipul, jon abraham ke paas bhi pahunche
 But during that time John was preparing to work on the recently released "nuclear"
 is vajah se unhone bhi film karne se manaa kar diya
 Eventually, Vipul had to go to Shahid Kapoor
 shahid chaahate the ki nishikant film ko nirdeshit karen, kyonki unki "toilet: ek prem katha" samikshakon or darshakon donon ko pasand ai thi
 Vipul agreed to Shahid's talk
 unhone kaha, "main maanata hum, star hameshaa kaamyaab nirdeshak ke saath kaam karnaa chaahate hai
 i don't even have an issue, i have a good story

 dilli ke kaaryakari mukhya sachiv ke rup main shakuntla gamelin ko niyukt karne ke maamle main dilli sarkaar or uparajyapal ke vivaad ne ab nayaa mode le liya he
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had asked Gamlin not to hold the post, but despite that Gamlin has taken charge of the acting Chief Secretary
 dilli sarkaar ne bijepi par uparajyapal ke jariye 'takhtapalat' karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 In fact, Delhi Government Chief Secretary KK Sharma has gone on a 10-day holiday, in whose place the Lt
 Governor appointed Gamlin
 dilli sarkaar ke upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne ise uparajyapal ke jariye bijepi kii takhtapalat karne kii sajeesh qaraar diya he, jabaki virdohi partiyaan ise kejariwal kaa raajnneetik stant bataa rahi hai
 Former Chief Minister Sheila Dixit says that Kejriwal either does not know the Constitution or he is not trying to know

 Shortly after the Delhi government's charge, the Lieutenant Governor also said that Gamlin has been deployed on the basis of preference and track record
 uparajyapal ne yah tainaati samvidhan kii dhara 239-e ke tahat kii he
 It was also said that it is wrong to drag an honest woman officer of north-east in such a way
 tippaniyan Ashish Joshi, who was a former secretary in the Delhi government, says that this has reduced the morale of bureaucrats
 jis tareeke se ek eemaandaar mahila iees adhikari par aarope lagaaya gaya he, usase sarkaar main kaam karne waalon par khaasaa nakaaratmak prabhaav padegaa
 At the same time, the constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap says that the government cannot challenge the powers that the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi has got
 haalanki pehle bhi dilli sarkaar or uparajyapal ke bich kai maamalon main matbhed rahe hai
 But the manner in which accusations and counter-charges are going on will not only undermine the credibility of the constitutional institutions among the common people, but will also affect the morale of bureaucrats

 purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit kaa kahana he ki kejariwal ji yaa to samvidhan jaanate nahin hai yaa vah jaanane kii koshish nahin kar rahe hai
 The constitutional position of Delhi is very different from other states
 yahaan agar kisi mukhyamantri ko kaam karnaa he, to use centre sarkaar or uparajyapal ko saath lekar chalanaa hi padegaa
 In fact, on Friday, the Lieutenant Governor had appointed Shakuntala Gamlin to the post of Chief Executive Secretary citing the constitution, but the Delhi government is opposing the appointment alleging collusion with power companies
 dilli sarkaar ke is aarope ke kuch hi der baad uparajyapal ne bhi apni safai dete hue kaha tha ki variyata or trek record ke aadhaar par gamelin kii tainaati kii gai he
 The Lieutenant Governor has made this posting under Section 239-A of the Constitution
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki is tarah se north-east kii ek eemaandaar mahila afasar ko vivaadon main ghaseetna galat he

 vahiin samvidhan ke jaankaar subhash kashyap kaa kahana he ki dilli ke uparajyapal ko jo shaktiyaan mili hai, use sarkaar chunauti nahin de sakati he
 However, there have been differences in several cases between the Delhi Government and the Lieutenant Governor in the past
 lekin jis tareeke se aarope-pratyaropon kaa daur chal rahaa he, usase aam logon main sanvaidhanik sansthaaon kii vishwasaneeyata par to batta lagegaa hi, naukarshahon ke manobal par bhi iskaa asar padegaa
 In fact, on Friday, the Lieutenant Governor had appointed Shakuntala Gamlin to the post of Chief Executive Secretary citing the constitution, but the Delhi government is opposing the appointment alleging collusion with power companies
 dilli sarkaar ke is aarope ke kuch hi der baad uparajyapal ne bhi apni safai dete hue kaha tha ki variyata or trek record ke aadhaar par gamelin kii tainaati kii gai he
 The Lieutenant Governor has made this posting under Section 239-A of the Constitution
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki is tarah se north-east kii ek eemaandaar mahila afasar ko vivaadon main ghaseetna galat he
 The comments dilli sarkaar main purv sachiv rah chuke ashish joshi bataate hai ki isse naukarshahon kaa manobal khaasaa gira he

 Shortly after the Delhi government's charge, the Lieutenant Governor also said that Gamlin has been deployed on the basis of preference and track record
 uparajyapal ne yah tainaati samvidhan kii dhara 239-e ke tahat kii he
 It was also said that it is wrong to drag an honest woman officer of north-east in such a way
 tippaniyan Ashish Joshi, who was a former secretary in the Delhi government, says that this has reduced the morale of bureaucrats
 jis tareeke se ek eemaandaar mahila iees adhikari par aarope lagaaya gaya he, usase sarkaar main kaam karne waalon par khaasaa nakaaratmak prabhaav padegaa
 At the same time, the constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap says that the government cannot challenge the powers that the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi has got
 haalanki pehle bhi dilli sarkaar or uparajyapal ke bich kai maamalon main matbhed rahe hai
 But the manner in which accusations and counter-charges are going on will not only undermine the credibility of the constitutional institutions among the common people, but will also affect the morale of bureaucrats
