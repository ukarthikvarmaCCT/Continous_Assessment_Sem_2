 An Indian teenager has given such an idea to America, that he will be able to save 23 billion 95 crore 20 lakhs in a year
 suvir mirchandani naam ke is bachche ne unke aadhikarik dastavejon ke font badalane kaa upaay diya he
 Suvir Mirchandani, a middle school student in Pittsburgh, has claimed that if the federal government uses the Garmond font, it will save 8 billion 14 million 36 million 80 thousand rupees annually, which is 27 billion 96 crore spent per year in ink
 39 lakh 60 thousand is 30 percent of the rupee
 iske alaava agar rajya sarkaar bhi ise lagu kar detii he to salanaa 14 arab rupee or bachaae ja sakate hai
 This idea came to Suvir's mind when he was thinking about how to save money by cutting down on useless things for his school's science project
 uske dimag main aayaa ki kaagaj or syaahi kaa kam se kam upyog karne se paisa bachaane kaa rasta nikal saktaa he
 Paper recycling also saves resources as well as saving money
 mirchandani ne kaha, kaagaj main istemaal kiye jane vaale syaahi par bhi agar dhyaan diya jaae to isse bhi paison kii bachat sambhav he
 She said, 'ink is twice as expensive as French perfume
 ' iske baad hi project ke liye uskaa puraa dhyaan syaahi kii laagat ko kam karne kii ore kendrit ho gaya
 In this experiment, he collected the papers of his school and the notes of the teachers
 saamaanya taur par istemaal karne vaale aksharon ko dekha, isamen e, t, a, o and r zyada the
 He then saw how many times this letter was used in different fonts Garramond, Times New Roman, Century Gothic, Comic Sans
 phir ink kawarej software main napa ki ek akshar ke liye kitni syaahi kaa istemaal ho rahaa he
 From his analysis he deduced that the letters of the Garramond font cost less ink
 to usne paaya ki uskaa skool hi garamond font kaa istemaal kar saal main 12 lakh 57 hajaar rupee bachaa saktaa he
 Subsequently, Suvir collected five samples from the website of government printing offices and the same result came from them
 agar sarkari daftar font ko badal lete hai to paise bachaa sakate hai
 This discovery of Suvir Mirchandani also appeared in the Journal for Emergent Investigator (JEI)
 yah harvard ke chaatro dwaara 2011 main taiyaar publication he, jo middle skool ke chaatro kii rachanaatmakataa ko ek placeform detaa he
 JEI founder Sara Funkhauser said, 'we are very impressed with Suvir's research
 ' JEI kaa kahana he ki suvir kaa yah project bade str par sangheey sarkaar ke paison kii bachat kar saktaa he
 Currently 1 year on government printing
 8 billian dollar kharch hota he or mirchandani kaa yah prayog itane bade str par lagu karnaa sarkaar ke liye ek chunauti he
 Gary Somerset, media and public relations manager of the government printing office, said that Suvir's idea is great, but its savings are only about online documents
 mirchandani ne kaha, 'har koi online jaankariyon ko upyog karne main sakasham nahin he
 Some documents still have to be printed
 main pahachaanata hum ki aadaton ko badalanaa thodaa mushkil he
 But i really want change and i will try for it as much as possible

 air india, jet airways, indigo or spicest jaisi companiyaan pakistan ke root se khadi deshon ke lieudanonka sanchaalan karti hai
 PAK aircraft returned to India in the past, an airline company official told the English newspaper 'times of India', 'in the last few days, India had asked some non-scheduled aircraft of Pakistan to return
 aise main pakistan bhi aisi hi karrwai kar saktaa he
 This is the biggest reason for airlines to demand the removal of Pakistan from the route, while there are some economic reasons as well
 'airforce or navy ke root ke jane kii maangi ijajatvimanan company spicejet ne apane vimaanon ke liye ahmedabad se sidhe khadi deshon ke lieudan kii manjuridene kii maang kii he
 The company says that it should be allowed to operate flights on routes used by the Airforce and Navy
 spicejet kii ore se is maang ke sambandh main dephence or civil aviation ministry ko ek prajentation bhi diya gaya he
 In every flight, 1 lakh rupees will be saved, in which spicejet said, 'removing Pakistan from the route will save fuel
 iske alaava carbon utsarjan main bhi kami aegi
 The company says that if it is allowed to fly directly over the Arabian Sea on the ahmedabad-dubai route, then a flight will save Rs 1 lakh
 raksha mantralay ne ab tak aise kisi prastaav ko manjuuri nahin di he, kyonki is root main kai samvedansheel ilaake bhi hai
 a source associated with the aviation ministry said, "we have received many requests from aviation companies

 Much progress has been made in this matter and much remains to be done

 Fantasy
 akasar bollywood par ye iljaam lagata he ki yah sachai se praayah koson dur rahati he
 But looking at the recent trends, many films have come out on political background
 kuch hi hafte pehle gandhi parivaar kii siyasat ko centre main rakhkar amir produsar ke flop actor suputr jaiki bhaganani kii film yangistan ai thi
 In this film, the dream of grooming democracy was sold by keeping young Josh ahead
 film aundhe munh giri
 Now there is 'bhootnath Returns', in which once again an attempt has been made to show the mirror to the existing democracy
 is baar aam aadmi party ke ubhaar se paidaa hue tarkon kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 Some idea of the story begins from the same place where its prequel 'bhootnath' came out in the year 2008
 kailash nath urf bhootnath banku naam ke bachche ko daraane main naakaamayaab hote hai or phir uske dost ban jate hai
 His family arranges for peace and Kailashnath is freed from the land and reaches the ghost world
 magar yahaan har koi unka majaak bana rahaa he
 Being a ghost could not even frighten the child
 bhootnath yah jillat bardaasht nahin kar paata or tab use miltaa he ek asinament
 Go back to the earth and scare the four children, then the honor will return
 bhootnath pahunchate hai dharavi
 Asia's largest slum
 or yahaan unki mulaakaat hoti he akhrot naam ke ek garib bachche se
 But the trick is that walnut can see Bhootnath like Bunku
 jald hi bhootnath or street smart akhrot main dosti ho jaati he
 With the help of Bhootnath the nut starts earning four paise with respect
 phir akhrot ek aisa kaam haath main le letaa he, jiske liye na sirf use balki bhootnath ko bhi bhuton kii khari khoti sunani padati he
 This is to help Bhau, a goon turned leader
 is galat kaam ko sahi karne ke liye akhrot bhaau ke khilaaf bhootnath ko chunaav ladgaye ke liye kahata he
 After the initial no-nonsense, Bhoothnath enters the election ground with the help of technical tricks of the law
 ab muqabla shuru hota he ghaagh netaa or aam janata ke numaayinde ke bich
 The name of this tug of war is 'bhootnath Returns'
 kin baton par rahaa he focusfilm main bhoot hai, magar kute hai
 Like the world of Ramsay Brothers dripping blood is not making a bad face
 unke bhoot world kii bhi waisi hi mushkilen hai, jaisi yahaan dharti par hai
 There is a lot of focus on India's problems, especially corruption which is prevalent at all levels
 chunavi raajnneeti ke tamaam daanv pech bhi khaae gaye hai
 For example, what does the complaint mean if the voter does not vote
 janata ain maukey par bik jaati he to phir siyasat ko kyon kose
 Apart from this, the philosophy of improving the present by juggling with the ghost of the children who are the future of the country has also spread
 kisne kii kisi actintamitabh bachchan bhootnath ke role main kabhi mazaakia to kabhi sanjeeda lage hai
 Partha, a child with broken teeth in a walnut roll, has done a tremendous job
 bachchan sahab sahi hi kehete hai ki in bacchon kii acting dekhakar lagata he ki abhi mujhe bahut kuch siikhnaa he
 Well, this is their nobility
 bhaau ke role main boman irani or unke gurgey ke role main brajendra kaala bhi jame hai
 Sanjay Mishra, the film Aankhen Dekhi Ke Bau ji, is seen here as a lawyer who is killed by the truth and is forced to do some more work in a cupboard full of black coat dust
 unki bechaargi or phir sankalp shandaar he
 Songs and everything else The two songs of the film have already become superhit
 meet bros anjaan or mika kaa party to banati he or yoyo hani singh kaa after party
 Apart from this, Dharavi slum is also fine
 magar film ke bich main ek documentry numa dhang se bharat kii garibi ke kai karun drishy dikhaata gaanaa sahib bojhil ho jaataa he or film kii raftaar ko bhi kam kar detaa he
 The length of the film is also more
 first half main yah kuch sust rahati he
 However, the speed picks up in the second half
 kuch ek baar ditels or sandesh dene ke chakkar main film bojhil bhi hone lagati he
 The specialty of Bhootnath Returns is that instead of divine powers, the story is woven with the help of human strengths and weaknesses
 bhootnath riterns ek bhoot kii kahani he, magar bhutiya katai nahin he
 In the film, the psychology of children and the spirit of teaching them virtue is in full swing
 diarector nitesh tiwari isse pehle chillar party jaisi shandaar film se jude rahe hai
 Here too his skill of direction is seen
 film bhootnath riterns van time family watch he or chuttee ke sijan main bacchon ke liye ek acchhee outing bhi
 That means the party is formed
 admician ke liye raksha mantralay ne kiya aadesh paritladakiyon ke daakhile ke liye 10 pratishat kota nirdharipub tak sainik skulon main sirf ladakon ko hi daakhila diya jaataa tha lekin ab ladakiyon ke liye bhi yahaan admician lene kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he
 Daughters who used to dream of serving the country by becoming military officers will now also be able to take admission here
 sena main jaakar desh seva karne kaa jajba rakhane vaali betiyon ke liye ek acchhee khabar he
 Because now she too can study in Sainik School
 isko lekar raksha mantralay ne aadesh bhi paarit kar diya he
 Admission started in Sainik Schools There are 5 Sainik Schools across the country
 unamem se ek uttarakhand ke ghodakhaal main sthit he
 The process of admission of girls has been started in five military schools of the country including Ghorakhal
 ab yahaan kaksha 6 main ladkiyaan bhi admician le sakengi
 Till now only boys were admitted in military schools, but now the way has been cleared for girls to take admission here too
 haalanki, is prakriya main us vakt teji ai jab uttarakhand ke almoda main 9veen kaksha main padhane vaali prasanna chhimaval ne 5 agast ko raksha mantralay, maanav sansaadhan mantralay or uttarakhand mukhya nyaayadhish ko is bare main patr likhaa tha
 Prasanna Chhimwal wrote that through this letter, Prasanna had said that in the military-dominated state like Uttarakhand, the admission of girls in military schools should be started from this new session
 prasanna ke patr par sangyaan lete hue raksha mantralay ne beeti 25 november ko ghodakhaal samet desh ke sabhi paanch sainik skulon main ladakiyon ke liye 10 pratishat kota nirdhaarit kar daakhila karne ke aadesh die hai
 Chhimwal said that his dream is to serve the country by joining the army, but he came to know that due to being a girl, he will not be able to get admission in the military school
 iske baad chhimaval nebharat sarkaar ke sambandhit mantralyako is bare main patr likhaa
 Which was taken seriously by the Indian government and it was decided to reserve 10 percent seats for girls in all military schools of the country
 pita ne kii beti kii saraahnaavahin apni beti ke prayaas kii unke pita vinod chhimaval ne bhi saraahna kii
 He said that this is a golden opportunity for the girls of the country to move forward, girls who want to go to the country service can now serve the country by going in the army
 saath hi unhone kaha ki uttarakhand ko sainik dham kaha jaataa he to yahaan par ek or sainik skool khulanaa chahie
 CM Trivendra Singh Rawat thanked PM Modi After this decision of the Center, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat also thanked the Prime Minister and said that he has opened the doors of Sainik School for daughters under Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao campaign
 yah ek acha nirnay he

 However, the growing population has had an impact on demand for residential and commercial complexes

 ab'appal'ke chamchamaate hue store bharat main bhi khulenge or raksha se lekar avinshan sector main 100 fisadi tak videshi nivesh aane kaa rasta bhi saaf ho gaya he
 After a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, these big decisions regarding foreign investment were announced
 sarkaar ne daawa kiya ki in faislon ke baad bharat duniya main sabase khuli arthvyavastha vaala desh ban gaya he or videshi nivesh ke liye duniya kaa sabase pasandida mulk bhi
 FDI now 'automatic' approvalmodi government's decision on foreign investment on Monday has three special things
 pehali baat ye he ki videshi nivesh ke raste se sari adchane hataate hue, mahaj kuch chizon ko chhodkar, har cheez main epadiai ko ab 'automatic' manjuuri milegi
 That is, investors will no longer have to wander from approval to rate and the decision will not be afraid of hanging for long
 niveshkon ko lubhaane kii koshishdusri baat ye he ki zyaadaatar chizon main videshi nivesh kii seemaa badha di gai he or teesri baat ye he ki videshi nivesh kii sharton main bahut si dheel di gai he or niyamon ko saral banaaya gaya he
 The objective is that no investor should stop coming to India by being entangled in the rules of entanglement law and getting stuck in difficult conditions
 niyamon main di chhotjaise appal or furniture ke nami brands ikia ke ab bharat main store kholane kaa rasta ab isliye saaf ho gaya kyonki sarkaar ne single brands retail main is nivesh karne waalon ko teen saal tak niyamon main chhot de di
 The first condition was that such brands would be allowed to open stores in India only if they bought at least thirty percent of their goods for their business in India
 somvaar ko hue faisle ke mutabik-bharat main bani khaane pine kii chizon ko bechney or uskaa kaarobaar karne ke liye 100 fisadi videshi nivesh ko manjuuri milegi
 Companies can also do this work with e-commerce
 -raksha ke kshetra mensarkaaraki manjuuri milane ke baad ab 100 fisadi videshi nivesh ho saktaa he
 For this, the condition of bringing the state of the art technology to India has been abolished
 sarkaar chaahati he ki bharat duniya main dephence sector kii chijen banane kaa bada centre banakar ubhare
 - 100% foreign investment will now be made easily to make mobile, TV, DTH and cable networks high-tech
 -nai dawa company lagane ke liye 100 fisadi videshi nivesh automatic tareeke se ho sakegaa
 After the approval of the government, 100 percent foreign investment will also be made in the already running pharmaceutical companies
 -isi tarah nayaa airport lagane ke liye 100 fisadi videshi nivesh or pehle se chal rahe airport main sarkaar kii manjuuri ke baad 100 fisadi videshi nivesh kaa rasta saaf ho gaya
 Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the government is confident that the removal of barriers in the way of foreign investment will create many new employment opportunities in the country and the dream of Make in India will also come true

 gauratlab he ki pehali baar aise bade faisle pichley saal tab hue the jab bijepi ko bihar chunaavon main karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa pada tha
 The IPL suffered a setback on Friday when player Luke Pomersbach was arrested from a five-star hotel in the capital on Friday for alleged molestation of an American woman and beating her fiance
 austrailia ke pommersbach ipel main royal chalangers bangalore team kaa hissaa hai
 Pomersbach is accused of molesting a woman at the ITC Maurya Hotel
 police ke mutabik, jab mahila ke mangetar ne unhen rokane kii koshish kii to pommersbach ne uske mangetar ko peeta, jiske baad use rajanyik kshetra main sthit primes aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 The statement of Siddharth Mallya, son of RCB owner Vijay Mallya in this case is shocking
 siddharth ne twit karte hue pommersbach par aarope lagane vaali mahila ko aade haathon liya
 Siddharth has tweeted that the girl who accused Luke of killing her fiance is doing so for popularity
 vah beeti raat puure samay mere saath thi or mujhase kisi prakaar kaa sahyog maang rahi thi
 If that person is her fiancé, then she should have acted as his future wife
 pommersbach ko dopaher main patiala house adaalat ne 20,000 rupee ke muchalke par jamaanat de di
 The Australian High Commission has also shown interest in the matter and proposed to provide legal help to Pommersbach by sending a diplomat
 udhar, ipel prabandhan kaa kahana he ki vyaktigat khilaadiyon ke vyavhaar ke prati vah jimmedaar nahin he
 The victim told Aaj Tak's affiliate channel 'headline Today' that the incident happened when Pomersbach and some other men who accompanied her joined her for drinking
 mahila ne hotel ke karmchaariyon par police ko bulaane ke liye sahyog na karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The woman said that we are staying at ITC Maurya and went to the lower floor with friends to drink alcohol
 austrailian khilaadi ne mere mangetar se kaha ki vah bhi hamaare saath sharaab pinaa chahta he, vah hamaare saath aa gaya
 We did not want to refuse him
 iske baad ham apane kamare kii ore aane lage
 i thought that when the two were talking, i left them and started moving towards my bedroom
 iske baad us aadmi ne mujhe pakad liya or mujhase chhedchhad karne kii koshish kii
 My fiancé stopped her
 mahila kaa kahana he ki jab usne hotel karmchaariyon ko police ko bulaane ko kaha to unhone sochaa ki main jhooth bol rahi hum or unhone is ghatana ke bare main kisi ko suchit nahin kiya
 The victim said that i called the operator and pleaded with him for help
 maine unase police ko bulaane ke liye kaha
 They said that she was calling now, but no one came
 kuch minute baad hotel ke prabandhak vahaan aae or bataaya ki vah police ko kol kar rahe hai
 After this incident, IPL Commissioner Rajeev Shukla said that we are not responsible for personal behavior in the hotel
 ipel kii ore se hotel main koi party yojit nahin kii gai thi
 Book: Expectations of hope Editor: Rohit Joshimat: 100 rupees It is a coincidence that this book is being written at a time when Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and Abu Azmi of the same party are in discussion due to their ridiculous statements about rape Huh
 donon ke bayaan kii chaaron ore se jabardast ninda hui he, honi bhi chahie
 Naturally no one can stand in favor of a heinous crime like rape
 lekin gaur karenge to ninda ke swar main parosi ja rahi daleelon main bhayanak antarvirodh bhi khoj paaenge
 It is not just a matter of linguistic level, it is about those dangerous beliefs which are knowingly and unknowingly penetrating within us, deep within
 masalan mulaayam ke bayaan kaa virodh karne waalon main ve log bhi shaamil rahe jo balaatkaar kii badi vajah mahilaon ke kapade pahanane ke dhang ko maanate hai
 This mass condemnation also included those who wanted to keep women in the fourteenth of 'self-defined' morality
 ve bhi jo bahuon se pardaa karne kii apeksha rakhte hai or jo kisi naakaam purush ko virodhswaroop chudiyaan dikhaane se gurej nahin karte
 In such a situation, a sociological study of the problem of rape becomes necessary
 kitaab ‘ummid kii nirbhayaayein’ aisa hi ek zaruri prayaas he
 It compiles articles written after Delhi's Vasant Vihar gangrape
 ye lekh 16 disambar kii ghatana ke baad ‘patrkaar prexis’ naam ke blog par saamaajik kaaryakartaaon, sthapit patrakaron or chaatro kii ore se likhe gaye the
 Rohit Joshi, a young journalist who runs a blog, has published them in book form
 yah sahi he ki dilli ke vasant vihaar gangrape ne desh main balaatkaar jaise aparaadhon ke khilaaf ek abhootpurv or zaruri aakrosh paidaa kiya
 But it should not be hesitant to assume that that honest outrage of the crowd was also suffering from the same ideological contradiction mentioned above
 dilli ke viviipi jone main poster or takhtiyaan lekar pani kii bauchhaaron main bheegate logon kaa gussa behad eemaandaar tha, unki sadashyata par sawaal nahin he, par us antarvirodh ko rekhaankit karnaa bhi jaruri he, jo aparaadhiyon ko faansee ko hi samasya kaa ekmaatr hal samajhataa he
 'expectations of fearlessness' helps to understand deeply the crime called rape by keeping aside all the emotional excesses
 padhane ke baad shaayad aap yah dharna bana paaen ki hamaare samaaj kaa taqatvar pitrusattatmak dhaancha or puraatanapanthi ravaiya hi purushavaadi vichaaron ko janm detaa he jo mahila ke khilaaf aparaadhon kii jad he
 Definitely read if the news of rape published in the rajas causes sorrow or anger
 balaatkaar ke liye kam kapadon ko jimmedaar maanate hon yaa faansee kii sajaa ko iskaa samaadhaan samajhate hon
 Or be very honest in your anger and seriously want to understand the problem of rape
 yaa stri vimarsh se ab tak achoote rahe hon
 This book is also for those whose chest fire got cold by candle march last year
 na padhein agarkoi kaaran samaj nahin aata he
 Just don't be allergic to Hindi words
 thodaa byoron main jaaen to
 
 
 The book is in five volumes
 pehle khand main balaatkaar kaa shikaar hui do mahilaon kii aapbeetee he
 One is Sohela Abdulali's famous article and the other is the story of a brave girl from Suryanelli
 balaatkaar kii shikaar mahilaayein samaaj se kya kahana chaahati hai, yah bahut kam hi saamne aa paata he
 Both these articles are also very useful in the sense that they hurt the tendency of seeing rape by associating it with the honor of the woman
 in donon aalekhon ne kitaab ke aage ke kathy ke liye behad taqatvar bhoomika bana di he
 In the second volume, Kavita Krishnan and Anand Pradhan have tried to understand the resentment arising out of the Delhi gangrape in their articles
 kavita ne mahilaon kii aazaadee ke paksh ko bakhubi ubhaara he or langik hinsa se nipatane main ‘capitalist modernism’ ko naakaafi bataaya he
 Professor Anand Pradhan considers this resentment auspicious sign for democracy
 unke mutabik, isaki sabase badi kamyaabi yah rahi ki isane mahila ke khilaaf badhati hinsa, unke sammaan or suraksha se jude masalon ko rashtriya raajnneeti ke agenda main sabase upar pahunchaa diya
 What is the basis of masculinity? The third section is very important
 yah balaatkaar ke samajashaastra ke bare main he
 Mohan Arya puts this problem in broad perspective
 mohan aryaa samajhaate hai ki balaatkaar kaise sirf aniyantrit yonechha se upja aparaadh nahin he
 He blames 'faulty social relations' for this
 agar aapmen sahamat hone kaa saahas he, to aapke liye yah kitaab kaa sabase upyogi lekh ho saktaa he
 In this section, Abhinav Srivastava explores the power of religion and the interrelationship of anti-women crimes
 dilip khan or bhashaa singh ke lekh media kii bhashaa ke sambandh main kuch jaruri sawaal uthaate hai
 From here, the book goes a step further and talks about the appearance of women in cinema and markets
 ve vigyaapan yaa filmein, jinhen dekhne ke dauraan aap pehle muskura diya karte the, shivani naag or adil raja khan ke lekh padhane ke baad aisa karnaa aapke liye thodaa mushkil ho saktaa he
 Even more painful is the story of other fearless incidents, there is also a 'shock value'
 arvind shesh kaa lekh padhenge to pataa chalegaa
 He raises an urgent and difficult question as to why the rape of women from backward and Dalit society, away from Delhi, never became a cause of public outrage

 Leader of Opposition BJP in Delhi Assembly, Vijender Gupta demanded that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal immediately sack his health minister Satyendar Jain from the government when it comes to buying land with hawala money
 darasal sutron ke mutabik, iskar vibhaag kii jaanch menjain ke hawala caribariyon se sathganthki baat saamne ai he
 Gupta made the point that he should stay out of the government till the Income Tax Department acquits him of the charges
 vah kehete hai, kejariwal jo naitikta kaa itnaa dam bharte hai, unhen apane mantriyon ke galat kaamon par pardaa daal kar nahin rakhana chahie
 Vijendra Gupta said that companies controlled by Satyendra Jain and his family are accused of purchasing more than 200 bighas of land around unauthorized colonies in the hope of making a big profit
 ye jameen bhale hi unke mantri banane se pehle kharidi gai thi, lekin ek duracharan vaala vyakti aap sarkaar main swasthya mantri ke mahatvapurn pad par asin kiya gaya
 The large-scale purchase of land and hawala business tell how the ministers of the party who raise the slogan to end corruption, are involved in corruption and violation of laws
 gupta ne saath hi kaha ki kejariwal sarkaar ko yah pataa he ki der-saver satyendra jain ko bhi sibiai dwaara giraftaar kiye jane kii sambhaavna he
 That is why the Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Minister has already started making noise that the CBI wants to arrest AAP government minister Satyendar Jain with a sense of revenge
 bataa den ki agar satyendra jain kii giraftaar hoti he, to ve dilli sarkaar ke chauthe mantri honge jo aarthik aparaadh ke kaaran giraftaar honge

 pakistan ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki is maheene ke ant main hone vaale dakshes shikhar sammelan se itar pradhanmantri yusuf raja gilaani or unke bhartiya samakaksh manmohan singh ke bich ab tak koi mulaakaat tay nahin hui he haalanki ek prastaav rakhaa gaya tha or vaarta phir se shuru karne par jor diya gaya tha
 Foreign Office spokesman Abdul Basit said in a weekly news briefing that no meeting between the two Prime Ministers has been decided yet on April 28-29 on the sidelines of the SAARC summit in Thimphu, although Islamabad has recently given one to New Delhi
 There was a proposal for this meeting in the roadmap
 basit ne ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha, ‘jahaan tak bhutan main aupchaarik mulaakaat kii baat he, isaki ruparekha abhi tak nahin banaayi gayi he
 "however, our roadmap calls for a summit in Bhutan and we look forward to a meaningful partnership with India," he said
 ’pradhanmantri singh se jab buudhvaar ko poocha gaya tha ki kya vah dakshes shikhar sammelan ke dauraan bhutan main gilaani se mulaakaat karenge to unhone kaha, ‘meraa maananaa he ki bhutan main mulaakaat ke bare main sochane ke liye abhi vakt he
 The Prime Minister had said that India can resume talks with Pakistan on all issues only if concrete and effective action is taken against those responsible for the Mumbai terror attacks
 basit ne kaha, ‘yahaan main yah rekhaankit karnaa chahta hum ki sarthak or parinamonmukhi vaarta main shaamil hona hamaare aapasi hit main he or kshetra ke hit main he
 It is not a matter of Pakistan being in India or India being in Pakistan's interest
 ’singh ke bayaan par pratikriya dete hue unhone kaha ki mumbai aatanki hamalon se jude pakistani sandigdhon par kanoonee prakriya chal rahi he
 He, however, clarified that dialogue between the two countries and for peace in the region is necessary
 washington main yojit parmaanu suraksha shikhar sammelan se itar gilaani or singh ke bich do sankshipt mulakaaton kaa zikr karte hue basit ne kaha, ‘donon pradhanmantriyon ne haath milaaye or prasannataa jaahir kii
 He also said that the hands were warmly drawn from both sides
 pakistan or america ke bich ek asainya parmaanu qaraar par bharat kaa rukh pratikul nahin hone ke manmohan singh ke khabaron main aaye bayaan par basit ne kaha, ‘bharat dwaara bina bhedbhaav ke siddhant ke aadhaar par rukh karte hue dekhnaa acchhee baat he
 ' 'rape ke aaropee' asaram kaa 'rape kaa aaropee' betaa narayan sai pehle tamaam iljaamon se inkaar kar rahaa tha, lekin ab vah har jurm kaa ikraar kar rahaa he
 Narayan Sai confessed for the first time that he had a physical relationship with many girls besides his wife Janaki
 lekin uskaa har ikraar, inkaar main lipta hua he
 He admits to being the father of an illegitimate son, but then says that he did all this by asking his wife Janaki
 vah balaatkaar kii report likhaane vaali ladki ko jaanane kii baat bhi kahata he, lekin lage haath yah kahana bhi nahin bhuulataa ki usne uskaa balaatkaar nahin kiya, balki vah to usase pyaar karata tha
 That is, he also confesses a crime together, but is not ready to accept the same crime as a crime
 is tathakthith sant kii is ajeeb prem pratigya ne dhakad pulisavaalon ko bhi sakate main daal diya he
 Narayan Sai admitted that he had physical relations with many girls apart from his wife
 usne mana he ki vah apni sadhika jamuna ke behad kareeb he
 Also, the Surat-based girl who has been accused of rape, also loves her dearly
 hajaaron logon ke bich baith kar gyaan or pravachan kii dingen haankenevaale narayan sai kaa kubulanamaa yakeenan chaunkaane vaala he
 The police interrogation of Narayan Sai in remand is also not surprising
 police:kya tumhaari apni hi sadhika jamuna or duusari ladakiyon se bhi najayas rishte the?narayan sai:hapulice:to kya tumhaari patni janaki ko isse aitraaj nahin tha?narayan sai:use kuch ladakiyon se mere sambandhon kii khabar nahin thi, lekin jamuna se rishte ke liye usne rajamandi di thi
 Police: How is this possible? Narayan Sai: Actually, my wife Janaki could not conceive
 isliye maine usase puch kar jamuna se rishte banaae the
 So that i can fill her lap
 police:lekin tumhaari patni janaki to is baat se inkaar karti he
 Narayan Sai: i cannot answer this
 haalanki police ke paas bayaan dene pahunchi narayan sai kii patni janaki ne uske is nae daanv ko sire se khaarij kar diya he
 He has said that Narayan Sai is lying about his relationship with Jamuna
 
 She neither allowed Narayan Sai to form a relationship with anyone nor did she know this
 haa use apane pati or jamuna ke rishton ko lekar shaq jarur tha or ek baar usne donon ko range haathon pakadaa tha
 Due to this relationship with Jamuna, Narayan Sai is still in the mode of yes and sometimes no on the question of Narayan Sai having a son
 vah kabhi to jamuna se apane bete kii baat kubul karata he or ise apni patni janaki kii god bharne kii koshish bataata he, to kabhi is baat se mukar jaataa he
 Apparently, in view of this trickery of Narayan Sai, Surat Police is also videographing the interrogation being done with him, so that milk and water of milk can be made if needed

 shobhaa ojha ne aarope lagaaya ki madhya pradesh beete 15 saalon main aparaadhiyon kaa garh ban gaya he or inkaa sarvaadhik shikaar pradesh kii betiyaan huin hai
 Ojha said that the incident in the hostel at Awadhpuri in the capital city of Bhopal is going to be a shock and it looks like the events in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 shobhaa ne kaha ki haal hi main supreme court ne bhi madhya pradesh main badhati balaatkaar kii ghatnaon ko lekar gahari chintaa vyakt kii he
 Shobha Ojha alleged that for the past several years, Shivraj Singh Chauhan has been declaring that there will be separate desks for women in police stations, separate women lawyers will be provided for women
 mahilaon ke khilaaf aise ghrunit aparaadhon ke liye vanastop centre hoga, jahaan unka na sirf aparaadh darj hoga balki unhen counselling, manochikitsak or vakil bhi uplabdh karaayaa jaayegaa
 The 'rape accused's relationship with Shivraj's ministers' is that all these things are limited to speeches only
 shobhaa ojha ne is dauraan kaha ki congress kii mahila kaaryakarta jald hi pradesh ke sabhi shelter homes or hostalon main rahane vaali ladakiyon se baat kar jaanane kii koshish karengi ki unke saath vahaan kaisaa vyavhaar hota he

 On the Uttar Pradesh government, the controversy over the inclusion of 17 castes among other backward classes in the list of Scheduled Castes has deepened
 sutron ke mutabik bijepi ke anusuchit varg ke netaaon ne naaraazgi jaahir kii he
 According to him, BJP always opposed this move
 sapa sarkaron ne do baar aisa karne kii koshish kii thi tab bijepi ne iskaa virodh kiya tha
 BJP had always said that SP wants to give full benefit of OBC quota to Yadavs by doing so
 ab bhaajapa khud aisa kar sapa ke jaal main funs rahi he
 Also, according to sources, he said, it is a shameless argument to say that the High Court's decision will be implemented after two years
 suchi main nai jatiyon ko shaamil karne kaa adhikaar sirf sansad ke paas he
 Adding new castes without increasing the Scheduled Caste quota will hurt the interests of the existing castes
 udhar, upi sarkaar ke mutabik vah sirf hoicourt kaa faisla lagu kar rahi he
 On the other hand, the central government also said on Tuesday that the Uttar Pradesh BJP government should not have included 17 communities included in the Scheduled Castes list, without following the prescribed procedure
 saamaajik nyaay evam adhikarita mantri thavar chand gahalot ne rajyasabha main shoonyakaal ke dauraan kaha tha ‘yah uchit nahin he or rajya sarkaar ko aisa nahin karnaa chahie
 In Zero Hour, this issue was raised by Satish Chandra Mishra of BSP
 unhone kaha ki anya pichhadaa varg main shaamil 17 samudaayon ko anusuchit jati kii suchi main shaamil karne kaa uttar pradesh sarkaar kaa faisla asanvaidhanik he kyonki anusuchit jati, anusuchit janajati or anya pichhadaa varg kii soochiyon main badlaav karne kaa adhikaar keval sansad ko he
 Gehlot also said that only Parliament has the right to remove any community from one category to another
 unhone kaha ‘pehle bhi isi tarah ke prastaav sansad ko bheje gaye lekin sahmati nahin ban pai
 The state government should follow the proper procedure otherwise the case may reach the court with such steps

 What is going to benefit the government? Its plan is not only for customers using government products
 sarkari lucky or mega drow yojana ke tahat 7000 upabhokta vikali drow bhi jeet sakenge

 These lucky traders are a bit unlucky compared to consumers, which means they are less fortunate as the consumers have a maximum weekly reward amount of Rs 1 lakh and a minimum of Rs 5000

 The work of the NITI Aayog is to prepare the framework of the infrastructure for successful government schemes, not to plan for lucky draws
 maine kabhi sapane bhi nahin sochaa tha ki niti ayog ke siio or flipcart ke siio ek hi bhashaa or ek hi totake kaa istemaal karne lagenge
 The market keeps doing all these tricks on its behalf, but now the government has also started doing it

 Reward schemes like tights free with vest, vim bar free with six glasses, a casserole with a purchase of five thousand, a hundred rupees gift voucher with a purchase of three thousand keep swinging in the general store
 ab vahiin par sarkaar kii bampar inami yojanaon ke poster bhi lataka karenge
 a consumer can get confused in a super market that it is the government that is the big market

 Recently, Ambedkar has announced to celebrate Jayanti as Water Day
 jaldi hi ambedkar jayanti ke maukey par duusare baaki kaam honge
 Somewhere a lottery will come out, somewhere a water day will be organized and people will forget to talk about Ambedkar
 ambedkar jayanti ham ambedkar ko yaad karne ke liye manaate hai na ki lottery nikaalane ke liye, water de manaane ke liye
 The government announced the incentive by announcing the prize money, but it should tell about the status of the basic and legal framework for cashless practice
 bataanaa chahie ki agar koi – walet company uske paise ke saath hera-pheri karti he, khate main der se transfar karti he to unke kya adhikaar hai, un adhikaron ko jald se jald lagu karaane ke liye sarkaar ke kya intazaam hai
 The government's job is to make consumers aware, not to tell them their rights, rather than draw a bumper draw
 niti ayog ke kaaryakari pramukh ne 100 divasiy latary yojana kaa elaan kiya he
 Amitabh Kant has stated that Lucky customers can win prizes from daily and weekly draws under the scheme
 unhen ek karod kaa inaam jeetne kaa bhi mauka milegaa
 15,000 consumers can win a thousand prize money every day
 25 disambar se lekar agle sau dinon tak unhen har din ye mauka milegaa
 Will the prize money be tax free? Many hundred crores of rupees are being spent on the prize money, then several crores will be spent on their advertisement
 company jab aisa karti he to uskaa laabh hota he
 What is going to benefit the government? Its plan is not only for customers using government products
 sarkari lucky or mega drow yojana ke tahat 7000 upabhokta vikali drow bhi jeet sakenge
 The weekly draw has a prize money of 1 lakh, ten thousand and five thousand
 vyapaariyon ke liye bhi vikali drow he
 7000 lucky traders will be able to win prizes of 50,000, 5000 and 25000 every week
 notebandi se dukhi chal rahe vyapaariyon ke bich ek lucky vyapaaree kii nai shrenee paidaa kar di gai he
 These lucky traders are a bit unlucky compared to consumers, which means they are less fortunate as the consumers have a maximum weekly reward amount of Rs 1 lakh and a minimum of Rs 5000
 lucky vyapaariyon ke liye adhiktam saptahik inaam raashi aadhi kyon rakhi gai he ye samajhnaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 The minimum amount is only two and a half thousand
 vyapaariyon ke liye lucky yojana kaa naam diji-dhan yojana he
 i liked the name very much
 godhan, stri-dhan, jandhan, kaala dhan vaale desh main dijidhan ek nai catagori he
 At least these words are a bit creative
 idia bhale hi big bazaar or flipcart se liya gaya ho
 The Delhi government launched the Bill Banao Inam Pao Yojana in October last year
 iske tahat upabhoktaaon ko pakke bill ke liye protsaahit kiya ja rahaa he
 It is obvious that this tax will come in the treasury of the government, but the lucky schemes of NITI Aayog seem to be involved from private to government products
 niti ayog kii lucky yojana ek ahm pahalu he ek karod kii inaam raashi
 Consumers will get a chance to win prize money of one crore, fifty lakh and 25 lakh
 vyapaariyon ko yahaan bhi ghaataa ho gaya he
 They will be given mega prizes of fifty lakhs, 25 lakhs and 5 lakhs
 aath november 2016 se 13 april 2017 ke bich cashles len-dein karne vaale isamen shaamil honge
 The comments shaayad lucky drow nikaalane kii tarikh bahut soch samaj kar rakhi gai he
 Who would have thought that the constitution maker, Dr
 bhimrao ambedkar kii jayanti par lucky or bampar yojanaon ke drow niklenge
 But was it impossible? big bazaar ne to ganatantr diwas or swatantraaa diwas ko hi bampar cell ke aayojanon main badal diya
 In the initial phase these days, instead of hoisting the flag in the park of their locality, they stood in line in front of the store of Big Bazaar
 haal hi main ambedkar jayanti ko water de yani jal-diwas ke rup main manaane kaa elaan kiya he
 Soon there will be other works on the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti
 kahin lottery niklegi kahin water de manegaa or log ambedkar par baat karnaa hi bhul jaayenge
 Ambedkar Jayanti We celebrate Ambedkar to remember, not to draw a lottery, to celebrate Water Day
 sarkaar ne inami raashi kaa elaan kar protsaahit karne kii baat to kar di lekin use cashles chalan ke liye banuyadi or kanoonee dhaanche kii sthiti ke bare main bataanaa chahie
 Should be told that if someone - the wallet company manipulates with his money, transfers late to the account, what are his rights, what are the arrangements for the government to implement those rights as soon as possible
 sarkaar kaa kaam he upabhoktaaon ko jaagruk karnaa, unhen unke adhikaar bataanaa na ki bampar drow nikaalnaa
 Under the Government Lucky and Mega Draw scheme, 7000 consumers will also be able to win the Weekly Draw
 vikali drow main 1 lakh, das hazaar or paanch hazaar kii inaam raashi rakhi gai he
 There is also a weekly draw for traders
 7000 lucky vyapaaree 50,000, 5000 or 25000 kii inaam har hafte jeet sakenge
 a new category of Lucky Trader has been created among the traders who are unhappy with the demonetisation
 ye lucky vyapaaree upabhoktaaon kii tulana main thode analki hai yani kam kismat vaale hai kyonki upabhoktaaon kii saptahik inaam raashi adhiktam ek lakh kii he or nunatam 5000 rupee kii
 It is difficult for lucky traders to understand why the maximum weekly reward amount is kept at half
 nunatam raashi dhai hazaar hi he
 The lucky scheme for traders is named digi-dhan Yojana
 naam mujhe bahut pasand aayaa
 Digdhan is a new category in the country of Godhan, stree-dhan, Jan Dhan, Black Money
 kam se kam ye shabd thodaa creative he
 The idea may have been taken from Big Bazaar and Flipkart

 After announcing her representation at the "winter Olympics", her now famous female cheerleader is ready for her fourth performance in the South

 bihar kii pehali mahila mukhyamantri or lalu yadav kii patni rabari devi ne susheel modi par aapattijanak tippanee kii
 In fact, a journalist from Rabri in the Bihar Legislative Council chamber sought to comment on Sushil Modi's reconsideration of Nitish's RJD and Congress alliance, to which Rabri made objectionable remarks
 rabari ne kaha-agar modi (susheel modi) nitish ji ko le janaa chaahate hai to unhen apni god main uthaakar le jaaen
 However, Bihar Legislative Council and former Chief Minister Rabdi Devi called her a joke after making objectionable remarks against Sushil

 The comments unhone apni is amaryadit tippanee par safai dete hue kaha ki rajanetaaon ke bich hansi-majaak chalata rahata he or ek-duusare kaa virodh karne ke baad turant ek saath dikhte hai

 haalanki bihar vidhaan parishad or purv mukhyamantri rabadi devi ne susheel ke khilaaf aapattijanak tippanee karne ke baad use majaak kii sangya di
 Later terming it as a joke, Rabri said that when she came near the main gateway of the council, Congress leader Sonia Gandhi and RJD chief Lalu Prasad, for the indefinite remarks made by the opposition leader Sushil Kumar Modi and BJP state president and house members Till Mangal Pandey does not apologize, the proceedings of the House will not be normal

 Ask Mani Shankar Iyer to speak two words, then he will say that he only needs 500 alphas to clean his throat
 par badbhole mani kaa saubhaahgya he ki unke alfaaz or unke lahaze, donon kii hi khub maang he
 Since the President nominated him to the Rajya Sabha and gave him a new lease of life politically, Iyer has been seen in every tear
 kabhi ve bharat-pakistan vaarta kii prashansa kar rahe hote hai to kabhi khaadya suraksha adhinium kaa gungan karte hai, kabhi congress kii dharmanipekshata kii pahchaan kaa bachaav karte hai, to kabhi upie sarkaar kii naksal niti par or kabhi 2010 ke rashtramandal khelon par ho rahi phijulkharchi par hamalaa bolte hai
 And often they dominate the current political debate
 ve kehete hai, 'main yah spasht kar duun ki yah meri nijee raay he
 i am certainly not the spokesperson of the party, although at times i feel that this is my conscience
 'ayyar kabhi ek purv pradhanmantri ke liye shabdon or nitiyon ko gadha karte the, par yah tab kii baat he
 Iyer lost the Lok Sabha elections fourteen months ago and was disgusted to see junior leaders from his position as ministers
 haalanki upie ke pehle kaarykaal ke behad sammanneey petroleum mantri ayyar ab phir se saansad ban chuke hai, lekin mantrimandal main apni vaapasi ko lekar ashankit hai
 According to Dastur, members of the Presidential Council do not usually find a place in the Union Council of Ministers, although there are some exceptions
 1971 main indira gandhi ne nur-ul-hasan ko shiksha mantri banaaya tha, jabaki unhen raashtrapati bhawan ne manonith kiya tha
 Iyer says, "by nominating me back, it definitely gives comfort to those who did not want to see me in the Council of Ministers
 party main main kisi pad par nahin balki asal main main khud ko kisi bhi tarah se shashan main shaamil nahin paata hum or isse mujhmen aisa akelaa or bahari vyakti hone kaa ehsaas hota he jise congress adhyaksh kaa sammaan or sneh praapt he
 She brought me back to Parliament within a year, despite my defeat in the last Lok Sabha election
 '' ve phir se charchaa main aa jarur chuke hai lekin charchaa kaa centrebindu banane se abhi bahut dur hai
 And for a person who has been loyal to the nehru-gandhi family, it is indeed painful to justify his existence
 punarvaas paane ke liye ayyar manmohan singh ke mantrimandal main jagah nahin paanaa chaahate balki ve to sonia gandhi ke think tanks yani rashtriya salaahkaar parishad (enesi) kaa hissaa bananaa chaahate hai
 He says, "today's single most important institution is not the cabinet, but the NAC, and the fact that i am not associated with it gives me a lot of years
 ''enesi kaa agenda ayyar ke samaajawaadee brands se khaasaa mail khaataa he, chaahe vah manaravga kii raashi ke vitaran ke liye panchayat raaj pranali kaa istemaal karnaa ho yaa phir khaadya suraksha adhinium kaa vistaar ho
 Though Sonia has hinted that she may bring a politician to the NAC, it seems unlikely that this place could be found in the close contact with Sonia, Jairam Ramesh, who at times is said to be part of her cabinet partner 'poor Man'
 'mani'
 mantrimandal se baahar hone ke baavjood ayyar aam aadmi kii aawaaj ke rup main apni alag pahchaan banane main safal hue hai
 And it is this voice that instinctively connects Sonia Gandhi's noble intentions to Rajiv Gandhi's policies
 ayyar ko congress main sakriy nehruwadi vichaardhaara kaa antim samajashastri kahana galat nahin hoga
 He still has that Nehru centenary year clock, which was presented to him by Rajiv and said, "you always think about them, so now you can see them all the time
" '' pi

 narsingh raav ke daur ko chhod den to doon skool ke hansi-thatthe ke alaava bhi unamem kuch to aisi baat he jiske jariye ayyar ateet ko vartmaan se jod sakate hai
 But who else could have got the family better than Iyer? yah soch kar aashcharya hota he ki paariwarik ghadi ke is dharak ko aakhir upekshit kyon chhod diya gaya he
 He says, "I can wait for some more time, but due to the age of about 70, the time is very short
 '' lekin peeche mudakar dekhne par, jiske liye unke paas nishchay hi khaasaa samay he, ve daawa karte hai ki ve ain us maukey kii pahchaan kar sakate hai ''jab maine man kii kah daali thi
 “it is in April 2007, when he was addressing a small sectional meeting of CII
 bahut kam logon ko jaankaree thi ki baithak kii recording ho rahi he
 At that time, Iyer rejected Manmohan's development story, saying that it is not comprehensive and its benefits are just 0
 2 fisadi logon tak hi pahunchaa he
 During this time he made his most famous comment, "I have always been a leftist, but after the economic reforms i became completely Marxist
 '' us vakt ve cabinet mantri the
 Happy with this comment, bjp's Yashwant Sinha asked in Parliament whether Iyer was speaking on behalf of the government or the opposition
 unako mili simit punerjeevan ke baavjood badbolepan ke kaaran unki ahmiyat jas-kii-tas he
 While his Congress colleagues are trying to make the Commonwealth Games a success, Gabyar Iyer is imagining every kind of disaster
 ayyar kehete hai, ''main bahut khush hum ki barsaat ho rahi he, kyonki isse desh main kheti acchhee hogi or rashtramandal khel kharaab ho jaaenge
 If these games are successful, then i will be sad because when this happens, the exercise of getting the Asian Games and Olympic Games done here will start
 '' ayyar ke is badbolepan se party kaa koi sarokaar nahin he, yah congress pravaktaa ne saaf kar diya
 Iyer did not regret his remarks but said that he was merely discussing wastefulness
 unke aakraamak mulya kaa yadi thik se dohan kiya jaae to congress ko phayda ho saktaa he kyonki ve media ke liye thik bayaan dene ke ustad hai
 Iyer, a former diplomat, attracts a few good voters from the middle class
 dharmanirpekshata or samaajwaad ke prati unki patibaddhtaayen spasht rup se sidhe congress ke ghoshnaa-patr se nikali hai
 From the very first speech in Parliament, he had made it clear that he would remain a full Congressman
 ve kehete hai, ''afsos he ki sansad ke niyamon se bandhaa hone se main bhaajapa ke prati apshabd kaa istemaal nahin kar saktaa
 "he remembers the time when he called BJP leaders 'fascists' in the House itself
" niyamon kaa ulanghan karne vaale is shabd kaa prahaar bahut tikhaa hua tha
 Even if Parliament silences them, their party may ignore them, but no one can stop this word
 dekha jaae to ayyar ne abhi mahaj apana galaa hi saaf kiya he
 On the occasion of launching the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday that the way the scheme has been launched, a new record has been set in the banking and insurance sector

 Where will you come ye koi nahin jaanata
 But sometimes the way sudden death comes, it is not sure
 yakeen aae bhi to aae kaise? kisi ko naachte naachte maut aa gai
 So someone died while talking
 kisi ko itani khushi mili ki achaanak saansen tham gayi
 So someone got such a shock that the beats stopped
 or or to gaate-gaate bhi achaanak saansen tham jaati hai
 It was a night of great desires
 
 a father was singing in his daughter's wedding in Kollam, Kerala
 
 These words of the Malayalam film song reflected the joy of her daughter's marriage and the sorrow of her departure
 or use gaate hue puure mehmaan bade itminan se sun rahe the ki achaanak gaate gaate wo achaanak stage par hi gir jaataa he
 a few moments before the fall, his breath had stopped
 jab wo gira to vahaan maujuud tamaam log sann rah gaye
 The 55-year-old Vishnuprasad suffered a heart attack as he sang on stage
 unki maukey par hi maut ho chuki thi
 But the marriage did not stop
 shaadi ke reeti rivaaj badastoor jari thi
 Some family members took him to the nearest hospital
 or kuch gharavaale unki beti kii shaadi kii rasm puri karvaa rahe the
 Because this night came after great wishes
 vishnuprasad ek arase se apni bitiyaa kii shaadi hote dekhnaa chaahate the
 But now he himself was not in this world
 aspataal pahunchate hi doctoron ne unhen bataa diya tha ki wo ek ded body ko aspataal laaen hai
 The family members decided that neither Vishnu Prasad's death will be reported to his wife nor his daughter
 ye khabar unhen shaadi ho jane ke baad hi di jaaegi
 Although daughter Archana was repeatedly asking her close ones
 papa kahaan he or har baar use kah diya gaya ki papa aspataal main hai
 Are fine kerala ke kollam zile ke is video ko jisane bhi ab tak dekha wo sann he
 The 55-year-old Vishnuprasad, who was posted as a sub-inspector in the police department in Thiruvananthapuram, was singing the Malayalam film Amaram on stage at the wedding of his youngest daughter Archana
 gaate gaate unhone dhun ke saath gunagunaanaa shuru kiya ki tabhi unhen dil kaa daura padaa
 And fell there
 vahiin unki maut ho gai
 The news of his death was given to his daughter Archana and wife on the next day of marriage
 palak jhapakate maut akele vishnu ko nahin ai
 Rather, these five people became likewise from this world
 un sabhi ko naachte naachte maut aa gai
 * In a dance competition in Mumbai, a 13-year-old boy tied his dance in just 12 seconds
 magar 13wein second main bhagwaan ne uski saansen baandh deen
 * The 25-year-old groom in Vadodara was so happy in his marriage that he danced openly on his friend's shoulder
 magar jab utraa to uski ankhen palat chuki thim
 Vishnu Chandra Dudhanath Pandey of Mumbai did not even know that on which stage he is going to dance and sing awards, the last scene of his life has also been written
 * wo bahon main bhi tha
 
 or mar bhi gaya
 This proved to be the last dance in the life of Vijay Dheldia, who was jubilant during a wedding in Jodhpur
 * badan par sitare lapete hue gane par thirakate thirakate is buzurg shaks ko aisa dil kaa daura padaa ki naachte naachte hi inkaa badan thanda pad gaya
 This is death
 ye kisi se appointment nahin leti
 And they all know that life and death are in the hands of the upright
 kab koun, kaise uthegaa ye koi nahin jaanata
 Death anywhere
 kabhi bhi
 Anyone can come
 bhale wo 73 saal saal kaa buzurg ho yaa 13 saal kii maasoom
 13-year-old Anisha Sharma was dancing on a stage in Mumbai
 koi mobile se video bana rahaa tha
 Somebody was clapping
 lekin vahaan maujuud kisi shaks ko nahin pataa tha ki agle pal hone kya vaala he
 Anisha fell on the stage while dancing after just 12 seconds of dance
 kisi ko kuch samaj nahin aayaa log aage bade
 Anisha was picked up and rushed to the hospital
 magar shaayad stage par hi anisha ne dam tod diya tha
 Actually, 13 years had come to participate in a dance competition in Kandivali West, Mumbai
 jahaan uske alaava saikadon duusare bacchon ko pratiyogita main hissaa lenaa tha
 In any case Anisha wanted to win this competition
 lihaaza usne is comptishan ke liye bahut mehnat kii thi
 Anisha opened her heart as soon as she climbed on stage
 magar mahaz 12 second dance ke baad hi anisha sharma gash aayaa or wo stage par hi aundhi gir padi
 And gone from this world forever and ever
 magar akeli anisha nahin thi ki jo naachte naachte is duniya se chali gai
 Rather, at a wedding ceremony in Jodhpur, this boy started laughing and laughing at the world
 darasal shaadi ke dauraan yahaan dance ho rahaa tha
 Dilwale Bridegroom will take the film
 tuje dekha to ye janaa sanam gane baj rahaa tha
 Which he used to dance with his wife
 teri bahon main mar jaaen ham line par
 The boy retreats to fill the girl in his arms
 tabhi achaanak uski ankhen chadh jaati hai
 And here, he falls down on the ground and dies
 magar gujarat ke vadodara main to ek duulhaa apni hi baraat main naachte naachte dam tod detaa he
 This bride named Sagar Solanki was sitting on a friend's shoulder and celebrating happiness
 magar tabhi wo achaanak kuch baichaiyn sa hota dikhataa he
 And on seeing it, he falls on his friend's shoulder and dies
 mumbai ke vishnu pandeya ko to unki company ne sammaan diya to wo is kadar khush hue ki naachte naachte stage tak pahunche
 The chance of happiness was because Vishnu was chosen for the gold medal in exchange for his hard work
 magar ekaek maahaul tab badal gaya, jab vishnu pandey naachte naachte stage par hi besudh gir pade
 When he was taken to the hospital, it was found that he had died on stage
 aisa hi is buzurg shaks ke saath hua jo ek kaarykram main naachte naachte dil kaa daura padane se stage par hi palat gaye or unki maut ho gai
 Seeing these pictures, one would realize that death cannot be assured
 kyonki wo kabhi bataa kar nahin aati

 During campaigning in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, the ruling BJP at the Center promised to waive the debt of the farmers of the state
 prachand bahumat ke baad rajya main bijepi kii sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 The challenge now is to fulfill the election promise of debt waiver
 bijepi shasit maharashtra main bhi kisaanon kaa karj maaf karne kaa dabaav bad rahaa he
 At the same time, the country's largest state-run bank has said that such promises will never compensate for the loss of economic condition of the country by promises of waiving loans for votes in elections
 naammumkin ho jayega bainkon ke liye kisaanon ko karj denostate bank of india kii pramuvarundhati bhattacharyane pradesh main kisaanon ke karj ko maaf karne ke sambandh main kaha ki is tarah chunavi vaadon puraa karne se desh kaa credit anushaashan kharaab hota he
 Farmers who will get the benefit of this, they will be expected to make such promises from political parties from the next election also for new loans
 bhattacharya ke mutabik in vaadon ko puraa karne ke liye satta main aane vaali sarkaar apane khajaane se paise adaa kar detii hai
 But there is a big challenge for banks
 bainkon se nayaa karj lene vaale kisaan pehle se aashwast rahete hai ki unhen is karj par bhi maafee mil jaaegi
 At the same time, giving loans to the farmers remains just a meaningless process for the banks because the farmers who take loans from it are just waiting for the election that a political party can promise them a loan waiver
 kya vaade se mukar jaaenge piem modi?upi chunaavon main prachaar ke dauraan pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pradesh menchhote or majhole kisanonka karj maaf karne kaa kai baar vaada kiya tha
 But now SBI is bluntly saying that waiving debt is a bad economic decision as it increases the npas of banks
 is faisle se sarkaar kaa khajaana khaali hota he or uske aarthik or saamaajik kaaryakramon ke liye fund nahin bachataa he
 So will the new government formed in UP take a decision that will harm the bank and the treasury to fulfill the election promise of the Prime Minister
 maharashtra or karnataka ko bhi chahie karj maafimaharashtra main mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis par kisaanon kaa karj maaf karne ke liye sahyogi shivasena dwaara lagaataar dabaav bad rahaa he
 Political parties sitting in the opposition are also demanding that when Prime Minister Narendra Modi can declare a loan waiver for votes in UP, then why cannot the debt of farmers in Maharashtra be forgiven
 maharashtra main kisaanon kaa karj maaf karne se rajya ke khajaane 22,000 karod rupee kaa dabaav aayega
 At the same time, in Karnataka, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has also appealed to the central government to waive the loans of the farmers of the state following the promise of PM Modi in UP
 siddharmaiya ne kendra sarkaar se kisaanon kaa aadha karj maaf karne kii apil karte hue kaha ki baaki kaa aadha karj vah rajya sarkaar ke khajaane se maaf kar denge
 Only the central government can waive debt, agriculture sector contributes 27 percent of the GDP of Uttar Pradesh
 lekin rajya main sahakaari bank or sahakaari samitiyon dwaara kam karj kisaanon ko diya jaataa he
 Only the state government has the right to forgive this debt
 vahiin, rajya main adhikansh kisaanon kaa karj rashtriya bainkon se hota he jiskaa karj maaf karne kaa adhikaar sirf kendra sarkaar ke paas hota he
 Therefore, to fulfill PM Modi's promise of debt waiver in these elections, public sector banks will have to give up their debt
 rajya main 2014 tak kisaanon kaa lagbhag 75,000 karod rupee kaa karj he
 Of this, only Rs 8,000 crore has been given by cooperative banks and societies and the rest by national banks
 vahiin rajya kii satta se baahar ja rahi samaajawaadee party rajya ke khajaane se 2012 tak ke 50,000 rupee ke kisaan karj ko maaf kar chuki he
 This decision puts the state government at a burden of 1,650 crore per year

 The song released on the youtube channel of Khesari Music World has exploded as soon as it arrives
 sawan maah main devgarh yatra se sambandhit is gane ko ab tak kareeb 1 lakh, 35 hajaar se bhi zyada baar dekha ja chukaa he
 Not only this, the song 'deoghar Book Kar Chal Jaai Ola' is also very powerful in terms of its music and lyrics

 South Africa, one of the contenders for the title on the strength of strong batting and strong attack, will be aiming for the last few times against their opponent when they get to play their first match in the ICC Champions Trophy against Sri Lanka at the Oval here on Saturday
 You will have to maintain your victory campaign
 tippaniyan South Africa has won all of the last seven odis played by Sri Lanka
 inamen is saal janvari 
 It also includes a five-match series played in South Africa in February in which he made a clean sweep 5–0
 isse pehle vishwa cap 2015 ke sidney main khele gayi quarter final main dakshin africa ne srilanka ko 133 ran par sametakar nau wicket se badi jeet darj kii thi
 South Africa, who are at the top of the ICC ODI rankings, seem to have a heavy upper hand but their record in the ICC tournaments has not been good and they will also be desperate to end their 'chokers' stamp
 dakshin africa ne 1998 main pehali champions trophy jiti thi or iske alaava vah kabhi koi isisi toornament nahin jeet paaya
 The South African team is quite balanced
 uske paas vishwa kaa number ek ballebaaj abi divilliars or vishwa kaa number ek gendbaaj cagiso rabada hai
 Apart from de Villiers in the batting, veteran Hashim Amla, explosives Quinton de Kock, Faf du Plessis and Jaypee Duminy are the other batsmen
 david miller apane visphotak tewaron ke liye jane jate hai jabaki kris mauris or vyne parnel kii alround kshamta team ko santulan pradaan karti he
 The performance of the South African players can be gauged from the fact that four of its batsmen and two bowlers are in the top ten in the ICC rankings while none of the Sri Lankan players are in the top ten
 dakshin africa ne srilanka ne jo pichley saat ekadivasiy match khele hai un sabhi main jeet darj kii he
 January of this year
 farvari main dakshin africa main kheli gayi paanch maichon kii shrinkhalaa bhi shaamil hai jisamen usne 5-0 se clin sweep kiya tha
 Earlier, in the quarter-finals played in Sydney at the 2015 World Cup, South Africa won by a huge nine-wicket victory over Sri Lanka by 133 runs
 isisi vanade ranking main sheersh par kabiz dakshin africa kaa palada baari najar aata he lekin isisi toornamenton main uskaa ricard acha nahin rahaa he or vah khud par laga ‘chokars’ ke thappe ko samaapt karne ke liye bhi betaab hoga
 South Africa won the first Champions Trophy in 1998 and apart from that they have never won any ICC tournament
 dakshin africa kii team kaaphi santulit he
 He has world number one batsman AB de Villiers and world number one bowler Kagiso Rabada
 ballebaaji main divilliars ke alaava anbhavi hashim amala, visphotak quinton decac, phalf du plasis or jepi dumini jaise dhurandhar shaamil hai
 David Miller is known for his explosive temperament, while the all-round abilities of Chris Maurice and Wayne Parnell balance the team
 dakshin africa khilaadiyon ke pradarshan kaa andaja isse lagaaya ja saktaa he ki uske chaar ballebaaj or do gendbaaj isisi ranking main sheersh das main shaamil hai jabaki srilanka kaa koi bhi khilaadi chotii ke das main nahin he
 Apart from de Villiers in the batting, veteran Hashim Amla, explosives Quinton de Kock, Faf du Plessis and Jaypee Duminy are the other batsmen
 david miller apane visphotak tewaron ke liye jane jate hai jabaki kris mauris or vyne parnel kii alround kshamta team ko santulan pradaan karti he

 Actually, Vikas Singh, advocate of the Hindu Mahasabha, gave the book of former IPS Kishore Kunal to the bench as an additional document

 However, Rajiv Dhawan also objected to this and said that this too is part of the book, it cannot be approved
 itnaa kehete hi rajeev dhawan ne us nakshe ko faad diya, paanch tukade kar die
 The counsel for the Hindu Mahasabha referred to the books of Buchanan and Thraler during this time
 puri kawarej padhein
 
 
 In anger, Rajiv Dhawan said that you have made fun of the court
 jawaab main vikaas singh ne bhi kaha ki majaak to aap bana rahe hai
 Also Vikas Singh cited the Oxford book and confirmed the birthplace
 vikaas singh ne kaha ki babar udaar tha, lekin aurangzeb kattar shaasha tha
 Babarnama does not mention any such thing

 BJP Delhi Pradesh President and MP Manoj Tiwari said on Friday that he will bring a notice of breach of privilege in the Lok Sabha against Aam Aadmi Party MLA Amanatullah Khan
 tiwari kaa aarope he ki is maheene kii shuruyaat main signechar brij ke udghaatan ke dauraan amanatulla ne kathith taur par unke saath marpet kii thi or unhen dhamkaaya tha
 The ruling AAP and BJP filed a complaint against each other in Delhi after the incident on November 4, alleging assault
 ek maheene tak chalane vaala sansad kaa sheetakaaleen satr 11 disambar se shuru hone vaala he
 Manoj Tiwari said, 'I will bring a breach of privilege notice against AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan under Rule No
 222 of the 20th chapter of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha
 'uttar-purvi dilli se saansdatiwari is kaarykram main apana virodh pradarshit karne ke liye gaye the

 china kii charmarati arthvyavastha or global karency va vittiya bazaaron main uthapatak kaa bharat tatkaal koi bada phayda uthaae yaa na nahin, lekin is maahaul kaa ek bada laabh jarur ho saktaa he
 In the midst of this financial restlessness, our leaders can get rid of their intrusive urges about the country's currency
 bharat main, bijepi or vamadal hameshaa se is granthi ke shikaar rahe hai ki rashtriya saakh ke liye fadakati mansapeshiyon vaali karency jaruri he
 He has successfully conveyed to the last person standing on the street that the weakening of the rupee is an economic sin
 lekin siyasat va bazaaron main pichley ek saal ke pherbadal ke baad aisa sanyog bana he jab karency jaise ek parivartansheel vittiya upkaran kii keemat main giravat ko rashtriya shame bataakar chunaav ladgaye vaali bijepi satta main he or majbootee dene vaale tamaam karkon kii maujuudagi ke baavjood rupaya avamulyan kii nai talahati chhu rahaa he
 This unique situation about currency, we should be free from our orthodox thinking and Dr
 manmohan singh ke us sutara ko sweekaar karne kaa nimantran detii he jo unhone 1991 main rupye ke bade avamulyan ke baad diya tha ki ''vinimay dar keval ek mulya maatr he jiskaa pratispardhaatmak hona jaruri he
 India's politics has been extremely conservative about currency devaluation
 1991 ke uthal-puthal bhare aarthik daur par congress ke netaa va purv kendriya mantri jairam ramesh kii taaja kitaab bhartiya raajnneeti kii rupaya granthi ke bare main dilachasp tathy saamne laati he
 Jairam Ramesh was one of the advisors to the Prime Minister during that period of crisis and reform
 ramesh ke sansmaran bataate hai ki rupye ko lekar pradhanmantri pi
 V
 narsingh raav ke aagrah bhale hi vamadalon yaa bijepi jaise roodhiwaadee na rahe hon lekin avamulyan ko lekar ve buree tarah ahasaj the
 During the financial crisis of 1991, the then Finance Minister, Dr
 manmohan singh ne rigerv bank ke jariye, 1 july or 3 july, 1991 ko rupye kii keemat kramshah 7 va 9 fisadi ghatai
 Till then it was the biggest devaluation of the rupee and that too in just 72 hours
 us daur main rupye kii keemat puri tarah sarkaar tay karti thi, aaj kii tarah bazaar nahin
 Ramesh writes that Prime Minister Rao was so uneasy with this decision that on the morning of July 3, Finance Minister Manmohan Singh was called and ordered to stop the second devaluation
 dow
 Singh tried his best to explain but the Prime Minister was not comfortable
 antat subah 9
 At 30, Dr
 singh ne rigerv bank ke tatkaaleen governor dow
 C
 rangarajan se ise rokane ko kaha lekin tab tak der ho gai thi, rigerv bank subah nau baje rupye ke duusare or bade avamulyan ko anjaam de chukaa tha
 Dr
 singh ne raahat kii saans lee or pradhanmantri ko utsaah ke saath faisla suchit kar diya
 However, the decision was not so easy
 avamulyan ke baad sansad main lambey samay tak pradhanmantri or vitt mantri ko apni party va vipaksh kii laanatein jhelni padin
 a lot changed in the country from 1991 to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but there was no change in the inferiority complex of the leaders regarding the rupee
 satta main baithne ke baad narendra modi or arun jetali ko is baat kaa ehsaas ho rahaa hoga ki ki unhone rupye kii giravat ko jis tarah desh kii saakh se joda tha, vah haasyaaspad tha
 Market experts read the rupee movement on technical charts
 is chart ke mutabik, rupye main taaji giravat (3 sitambar 66
 24 rupees per dollar) looks like 2013, when the rupee 68
 80 tak tut gaya tha
 The mention of 2013 is necessary because the political campaign to call the weak rupee the weakness of the country was born during that time
 2013 main kachche tel kii keemten 100 dollar prati bairal se upar thim
 All balances of foreign exchange inward in India were collapsed
 haalat is kadar buree thi ki rigerv bank ko rupye par sankat taalane ke liye upayon kaa puraa dasta maidan main utaarna padaa tab jaakar kahin haalat sudhari
 But today when crude oil prices are at $ 44, forex reserves are at a record level of $ 355 billion, inflation is declining, trade deficit is falling, gap in foreign inward withdrawals is still decreasing, rupee strength still Diving is eating along the lines of 2013 instead of planting
 yah paristhit siddh karti he ki karency ek parivartansheel vittiya upkaran he, jise bhavuk rashtriyata ke sandarbh main nahin, balki aarthik halaat kii roshni main dekhnaa hi samajhadaari he
 If Finance Minister Jaitley had to defend the fresh depreciation of the rupee, he would say that in the last few months, except for the Philippine Peso, Thai Bat and Indian Rupee, all the currencies of emerging markets had fallen
 isliye rupye kaa 66-67 pahunchnaa koi badi baat nahin he
 Indian currency exports had become much stronger than other competitive currencies of the market, this devaluation would give us an edge in exports
 yakeenan, unke is tark main aapako 1991 ke dow
 Only Singh's words will be heard
 jairam ramesh kii kitaab main dow
 Singh's reply is recorded which he gave in the Rajya Sabha debate after the major devaluation of the rupee in 1991
 unhone kaha tha ki angrej bharat ko praathmik utpaadon kaa niryaatak banaakar rakhana chaahate the, audyogic utpaadon kaa niryaatak nahin
 So the rites of keeping the household currency always strong were filled
 rupye kaa santulit avamulyan hamen aadhunik va pratispardhaatmak banaata he to vah raashtra virdohi kaise ho jayega? aaj dollar kii keemat 67 rupye par pahunchate dekh kya modi-jetali samet puri bijepi yah sweekaar karegi ki hameshaa taqatvar rupye kii vakaalat british aupniveshik aarthik niti kii himaayat nahin thi? kya bijepi ab yah sweekaar karegi ki rupye ke avamulyan main paap yaa apmaan jaisaa kuch nahin he
 If you are in the market then you must be competitive

 The Maharashtra Minister of Cooperation has got a unique experience after the Red Light, that is, the VIP culture, was refused by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 mantriyon kaa sadak par ab wo rutaba nahin rahaa jo isse pehle hua karata tha
 Sources reveal that Maharashtra's Cooperation Minister was recently coming to Mumbai from Pune after finishing the BJP state executive meeting
 is safar ke dauraan jab ve desh ke pehle express ve par se gujarey to unka saamana toll booth se hua
 The first toll coming from Pune to Mumbai is from Khalapur where a toll of around Rs 200 is charged for a four wheeler
 tippaniyan The minister's car was stopped as soon as the toll booths arrived
 mantriji ke pie ne toll booth oparator ko bataane kii koshish kii ki mantriji gaadi main savaar hai
 However, he was not heard from
 gaadi par batti kaa na hona isaki vajah bana
 In such a situation, the minister filled the toll and walked towards Mumbai
 haalanki mantri ke kafile kii baaki gadiyon main savaar logon ne toll nahin bharaa
 They managed to reveal their identity
 gauratlab he ki bijepi ne satta main aane se pehle maharashtra ko toll free banane kaa vaayada kiya tha
 When NDTV India contacted Minister Subhash Deshmukh on the whole matter, he accepted the incident and said that where would they raise controversy and introduce themselves? So i thought it better to go ahead with the toll
 unase jab poocha gaya ki kya baaki mantriyon ko bhi aap kaa anukaran karnaa chahie to joardaar tahaakaa lagaate hue deshmukh bole, no caments

 unase jab poocha gaya ki kya baaki mantriyon ko bhi aap kaa anukaran karnaa chahie to joardaar tahaakaa lagaate hue deshmukh bole, no caments
 Significantly, before coming to power, BJP had promised to make Maharashtra toll free
 puure maamle par jab NDTV india ne mantri subhash deshmukh se sampark kiya to unhone ghatana ko sweekaar karte hue kaha ki kahaan vivaad badhaate or apana parichay dete? isliye maine toll bharkar aage nikalnaa behatar samajha
 When he was asked whether the other ministers should also follow you, Deshmukh said loudly, no comments

 However, given the ongoing confrontation between the Delhi government and the MCD, it is unlikely that the Delhi government will pursue this proposal
