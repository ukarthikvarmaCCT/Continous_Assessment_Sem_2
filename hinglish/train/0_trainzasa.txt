 In such a situation there is no need to go to court

 NITI Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar says that the central government cannot make an excuse by saying that it is 'inherited from the Congress'
 sarkaar ko apni uplabdhi hi nahin, balki vifaltaaon kii bhi jimmedaari leni hogi
 It is often seen that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and many of its senior leaders accuse the Congress of failure of governance, policy paralysis and ruining the economy, and raising the question of sluggishness in work 'inherited from Congress' Let's try to escape
 kaamkaaj par karnaa hoga gaurasanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (upie) shashan se 2014 main maujuuda sarkaar ko mili viraasat ke sandarbh main rajeev kumaar ne kaha ki narendra modi sarkaar ke pichley chaar saal ke kaamkaaj par gaur karnaa jaruri he, kyonki yah sarkaar pichley muddon se ubar chuki he, isliye sarkaar ko apni khubi ke aadhaar par nirnay karnaa chahie
 Kumar said in an interview to news agency 'IANS' that the economy has recovered from those inherited problems, so they should no longer be used to make any kind of excuse
 apni khubi ke aadhaar par len faislaunhone kaha, 'kul milakar in sabake (viraasat main mili samasyaon) baavjood sarkaar ne bahat kuch kiya he
 The government has brought major structural reforms like demonetization, GST, insolvency and bankruptcy code, benami law, RERA and recapitalization of banks to get rid of those problems
 meraa maananaa he ki ham aakhirkaar unase ubar chuke hai or isliye sarkaar ko apni khubi ke aadhaar par nirnay karnaa chahie
 'significance of the statement This statement by Kumar is very important, because senior leaders of the saffron party, including BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Minister Arun Jaitley, have been constantly accusing the Congress of ruining the economy and saying that the government should bring it back on track

 i believe this government has done very well (performance)
 'unhone kaha ki jab bijepi ne 2014 main satta sanbhali thi to mahangaai dar nau fisadi ke str ko paar kar gai thi or vikaas dar ghatakar chah fisadi se neeche aa gai thi

 However, Kumar admitted that the performance of the export sector is a matter of concern and water crisis is going to arise
 unhone kaha ki pani sankat or shiksha kii gunvattta par dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 Preparing to deal with problems, Rajiv Kumar said, 'these are serious problems
 ise sulajhane main vakt lagegaa, lekin sarkaar ko shrey diya janaa chahie ki unhone in samasyaon ko sangyaan main liya he na ki usase munh modaa he

" sthaneey logon kaa maananaa he ki gandhi topi pahanane se bacchon main vishwaas, deshbhakti or sahi mulyon kaa vikaas hota he

 Spokesman arrived
 2ji ghotaale ke kathith nuksaan kii bharpai kaa utsav shuru ho gaya tha
 (spectrum — the wireless frequency at which mobile runs) March 2018 — The Union Cabinet decided that telecom companies will now pay spectrum fees to the government in 16 years instead of ten years
 companiyaan ab apni jarurat se zyada spectrum bhi rakh sakengi (ise jamkhori bhi kah sakate hai)
 Telecom companies 7 after buying spectrum from the government at a high price
 7 lakh karod ru
 Is buried in debt
 sarkaar kii taaja meharbaani se companiyon ko 550 arab ru
 Will benefit hairat ho rahi he na ki 2015 kii bhavy safalataa mahaj teen saal ke bheetar doorsanchaar kshetra kii beemaari or uske ek rahasyamay ilaaj main kaise badal gai ?2015 se 2108 tak doorsanchaar kshetra main aisa bahut kuch hua he, jise samajhnaa un sabake liye jaruri he jinke haath main ek mobile he
 The auction of the spectrum began after the 2G scam
 doorsanchaar ke dhandhe main spectrum hi kaccha maal he
 The first bid of 2015 was strong, but in 2016 the second bid was seen by the companies (5
 64 kharab ru
 65,000 crore against the target of Rs
 kii bikri) diya
 The natural spectrum is natural resources
 jis company ke paas jitna adhik spectrum, uske paas bazaar main utani adhik badhat kaa mauka or niveshkon kii nigaah main oonchi keemat
 On the shopping of spectrum, companies did not loose their pockets but instead showed it and took loan from banks
 jo do saal main time bam kii tarah tikaticne laga or phir sarkaar kii raahat baras padi
 Meanwhile, the 2G scam that led to the auction was a scam in the court
 sab bari ho gaye
 The government while buying expensive spectrum market and the companies buying it had said that the network (call drop) is in bad condition due to lack of spectrum but since 2015, the last visit of mobile network Digital India everywhere in the country Are removing or yah kisne kaha tha ki companiyon ko frequency milengi to mobile daren sasti hongi? nae khilaadi jio ne bhi pichley saal daren badha deen
 Between 2015 and 2018, the competition in the mobile market was reduced to three companies - Air Tail, Jio, Vodafone (merging Idea)
 sarkari beasenel biimaar he or ritair hone vaala he
 Now the three companies have most of the spectrum and also the entire market
 haal main airsel ke diwalia hone se kareeb 8 karod upabhokta inhen teen ke paas jaaenge
 Maybe what happened in the telecom sector between 2015 and 2018, even if someone tries to smell the scam, but where do the scams distract us now? Our governments have become impotent
 2014 main satta main aane ke baad sarkaar ko yah tay karnaa tha ki prakritik sansadhano (spectrum, koyala, jameen) ko bazaar se baantne kii niti kya hogi?uske saamne do vikalp theah ek—oonchi keemat par prakritik sansaadhan bechakar sarkari rajasav badhata hua dikhaaya jaae, jiske liye companiyaan bainkon se karj (jamakartaon kaa paisa) uthaakar sarkaar ke khate main rakh dengi
 And the drum of success will ring
 doosraa—sansadhano kaa sahi moolyankan kiya jaae
 They should be kept cheap so that their use increases investment, demand, jobs and competition and keeps the rates low for the consumer
 apni doordarshita par riz rahi sarkaar chaar saal main spectrum jaise sansadhano ke aavanton kii spasht niti tak nahin bana pai
 So the story is that after the 'spectacular auction' of spectrum: companies got spectrum, got a lot of loans from banks and also got exemption from license fees
 bazaar par ekadhikaar bonus main
 The government's earnings did not increase
 bank karj dekar funs gaye
 Mobile networks have gone from bad to worse
 mobile bazaar main pratispardhaa teen companiyon main simat gai
 Keep in mind that the entire liberalization was done to give consumers enough options in the market

 Every forest dweller of the forested villages of the Patha region of Bundelkhand, part of Uttar Pradesh, spontaneously utters the saying, 'don't fall apart, even if you die
 
 'actually, there is a ruckus in the Patha region for water
 tamaam sarkari prayaason ke baad bhi peyajal sankat se nijaat nahin mil pai he
 Due to the drying up of natural water resources, people here have become dependent on the villages of the neighboring state of Madhya Pradesh for drop-off water
 yah kshetra hameshaa peyajal sankat se jujhataa rahaa he
 Asia's largest drinking water scheme was started here with the initiative of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, but this scheme also failed to provide sufficient water to the students
 sabase zyada un gaanvon kii haalat khasta he, jo pahadiyon ke bich main based hai
 Here people have been able to make their way through natural waters
 madhya pradesh kii sarhad se lage gobari, godrampur, bagholan, raja daadi, kaari daadi, mawasi deraa, mavaiya, bilariamath, jaraila jaise kareeb teen darjan gaanv ke kareeb nau sau vanavaasi parivaar vindhyas parvat shrenee se nikalne vaale kanali naala or baan ganga ke jharne se pani kaa intjaam karte aae hai
 Like every year, both these springs have dried up
 in gaanvon main lagavaaye gaye takreeban sabhi sarkari handpump pani dena band kar chuke hai
 Now people cross the border and go to bullock carts or bicycles in the villages of Madhya Pradesh and bring water and fulfill their needs
 mawasi deraa gaanv ke rahane vaale maiyadin khergar ne bataaya, 'patharilii chattaanon kii vajah se gaharaai tak bor na kar bees feet tak kii gaharaai vaale handpump lage hai
 Almost all of these hand pumps pump the thirsty mouth by throwing air instead of water
 'unhone bataaya, 'ham log tadake se baiylgaadee yaa cycle ke jariye do se teen kilometre kaa junglee safar tay kar madhya pradesh ke gaanvon se pani dhote hai
 When asked about the water crisis, the lady of the same village came out with a proverb from her tongue, "don't fall, even if Khasam dies
" ' is mahila kii kahawat se spasht he ki vanavaasi mahilaayein peyajal sankat se kitni dukhi hai
 Subtila officer Atra Sunil Verma says that the revenue officer and the team of employees have been sent to these villages of Patha, the spoiled hand pumps are being repaired
 vahiin, apper jiladhikari banda (vitt evam rajasav) kedarnath singh kaa kahana he ki junglee gaanvon main based vanavaasiyon ko pani uplabdh karaane ke bharsak prayaas kiye ja rahe hai, jarurat padi to tankeron se pani bheja jayega
 ' tippaniyan Many times we do not know what kind of perceptions we are going to play
 sex ko lekar hamaare samaaj main bahut bada tabu he
 Public mention of this word leads to many hesitations
 kyonki hamaare samaaj main sex ajukeshan kaa abhaav he
 This is the reason why the secret disease which is natural, still hesitates to accept and treat it openly
 bollywood ne pichley kuch samay se jhijakna band kar diya he
 Films have started being made on issues on which there is not much talk, there are taboos among the majority of the population
 vicky donor, shubh mangal saavdhaan, pad main or toilet ek prem katha jaisi filmein iskaa udhaaharan hai
 Now Sonakshi Sinha's new film Khandani Shafakhana has also been included in this episode
 ye film sex sambandhit bimariyon ko dabaa kar rakhane or kisi ke saamne khul ke naa bataa paane, doctor ke paas jane se hichakane vaale logon ko lekar he
 Many times during sex people have various types of problems which is common
 ye kisi ke saath bhi ho saktaa he
 When it is common then why is it not normal to talk about it? These questions have been asked through the film
 punjab kii kahani he
 The film seems to give this message again and again that it is as natural to speak or mention the sex word as it is unnatural not to talk about it
 uske bare main baat nahin kar hamane ise alag hi rup main paribhaashit kar liya he
 And this is the reason why the term is considered vulgar
 chunki samaaj hi aisa he to jab film kii kahani main sonakshi sinha logon kii sex sambandhi bimariyon kaa ilaaj karne kii thaanati hai unhen ghar, mohalle or apano kaa tiraskaar jhelana padaa
 But his spirit never waned
 film ke jariye yon sambandhi samasyaon ko lekar logon ko jaankaree or jaagruk karne kii koshish kii gai he
 The film stars Sonakshi Sinha in the role of Babita aka Baby Bedi
 sonakshi punjab ke ek chote se toun main rahati hai
 She is a medical representative and promotes her company's medicines
 pita ke guzar jane ke baad ghar kii haalat utani acchhee nahin rah jaati
 Sonakshi lives with her mother
 unka ek bhai (varun sharma) he, jo ek number kaa aalsee he or gharavaalon ko usase koi ummid nahin
 Eventually, all responsibility falls on Baby's shoulders
 baby ko kama kar ghar kaa kharchaa chalaanaa he or parivaar par jo karj he use bhi utaarna he
 Everything is going on like that in the meantime there is a twist in the story
 sonakshi ke mamaa ji yani kulbhushan kharbanda khandaani shafakhana chalaate hai jahaan ve yon sambandhi samasyaon kaa ilaaj karte hai
 His medicines shoot people and his business is also doing well
 isi bich kuch sanghathanon kii mili bhagat se unka naam kharaab karne kii koshish kii jaati he
 Mama ji feels helpless and cannot bear the burden of insult for a long time
 ek din achaanak baby ko unke marane kii khabar milti he or saath hi ye bhi pataa chalata he ki apana khandaani shafakhana mamaji ne baby ke naam kar diya he
 Now Baby has two options
 yaa to wo samaaj ke dar se is ofer ko thukraa de yaa phir apane mamaa kii viraasat ko aage badaye
 Baby chooses the second option and they don't even know how risky it is
 yaheen se shuru hoti he baby ke hakim baby bedi banane kii kahani
 Baby has to listen to taunts from the society while being treated at the family's shafakhana
 shahar ke bich bich market main ek ladki dwaara gupt rogon kaa ilaaj karnaa is film ko behad khaas banaata he
 It requires an impotence and freshness
 jo baby main kuta kuta kar bhare hai
 Then she has no effect from the taunts of the society and she continues her struggle
 haalanki is sangharsh ke dauraan kuch rochak mode aate hai jo aapako film dekhakar pataa chalenge
 It is interesting to see an important story on screen with a laughing joke
 film main sabhi kalakaaron kii acting laajawab he
 Sonakshi Sinha has played the role of a perfect Punjabi girl
 unke alaava bhai ke role main varun sharma, edwocket ke role main anu kapur, mamaji ke role main kulbhushan kharbanda ne badhiya kaam kiya he
 The arrival of actor Rajesh Sharma in the role of a judge creates a different atmosphere
 unka kairactor kam samay kaa he magar behad unic he
 Judges have always been presented in a very serious way
 magar rajesh ne is kirdaar main rochakata bhar di
 Now talk about the charm of the film
 badshaah kii
 The singer who has sung superhit rap is also an expert in acting
 is film main badshaah ne ahm role play kiya he
 His followers will be happy to see his acting
 film main gane kam hai or jahaan jarurat he vahiin hai
 The film's dialogues are fine
 magar script kahin naa kahin akharati he
 The film does not have the speed that binds it from beginning to end
 bich main thodi-thodi ubaau lagane lagati he
 If Varun Sharma got more good dialogues, then the film's lack of intermittency would not be a hindrance
 is movie ke jariye massej to bahut acha diya gaya he magar shaayad ise filmaane kaa andaaj jaraa or alag hota to film jehan main ghar kar leti
 But it must also be acknowledged that Sonakshi's effort was 100 percent on her part
 unka abhinay nikhar kar saamne aayaa
 The lead actor of the film was there and it is a big deal to go ahead with the film on its own
 saportive rolls se bhi unhen acchhee help mili
 His chemistry with Priyansh Jora may have been strong, but according to the script of the film, there was not much space for the love-love scenes
 film kii shooting lokation acchhee he
 The beauty of Punjab is seen in the shooting of some locations, which is attractive
 film dekhne laayak he or dikhaane laayak bhi
 The Khandani Shafakhana is indeed an important story
 uttar pradesh main vidhansabha kii yachika samiti ncensal builderke khilaaf dhokhadhadi kaa maamla darj karne kii sifarish kii he
 The committee has said that in order for the builder not to run away from selling his stake, Ansal chairman Sushil Ansal should be confiscated
 is maamle main ab tak kii gai jaanch ke bare main bhi samiti ne ld or awaas vikaas vibhaag se jawaab maanga he
 Assal is accused of taking money from consumers for the development of the land that he took from the government in all its housing schemes, but almost Rs 500 crore was not deposited to the government
 saath hi edablyooes or elayeeji cote ke kareeb 2,356 makaan ansal ko banane the lekin inamen se aadhe hi banaaye
 Not only this, the possession of only 96 of these houses was given to the public and their condition is also bad
 samiti ke mutabik ansal ne vyapak paimaane pardhokhadhadeeki he or iske kaaran turant ansal builder par aapraadhik mukadmaa darj hona chahie

 After all the bitter and threatening statements, now US President Donald Trump and North Korea's ruler Kim Jong are going to meet each other
 mulaakaat kaa vakt, taarikh or jagah mukarrar ho gai he
 Donald Trump himself told that the meeting would be held in Singapore on 12 June
 donon netaaon kii is bahupratikshit meeting ko lekar alag-alag kayaas lagaae ja rahe the
 It would have been decided that there would be a meeting, but there was doubt about when and where it would take place
 aakhirkaar ye suspence bhi khatm ho gaya
 But there are many reasons why Singapore was chosen for the meeting of Kim Jong Un, the president of the world's most powerful country and the most talked about dictator
 -donon deshon ke singapore se achche sambandhsingapore ateet main bhi hai profile rajanyik mulakaaton kaa gavaah rahaa he
 At the same time, there is a deep connection between the US and Singapore
 jorge dablyoo bush ke shasankaal main america or singapore ke bich mukt vyapaar samjhauta hua tha
 Subsequently in 2012, the Obama administration also accepted Singapore as a strategic partner
 iske teen saal baad donon deshon ke bich suraksha samjhaute bhi hue, jo donon mulkon ke majboot rishton ko darshata he
 At the same time, Singapore also has diplomatic relations with North Korea
 donon deshon ke bich 1975 main rajanyik sambandhon kii shuruyaat hui thi
 Singapore also has an Embassy in North Korea
 haalanki, november 2017 main antarrashtriya pratibandhon ko or kadaa kiye jane ke baad singapore ne uttar korea se sabhi vyapaarik sambandh tod liye the, lekin maujuuda vakt main bhi donon deshon ke bich halaat saamaanya hai
 -singapur, a neutral place, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly chose Singapore as the most friendly place to meet, the biggest reason being the meeting of the two leaders in a neutral country
 singapore na sirf lokation balki vichaardhaara or bhugol ke lihaaj se bhi america ke liye sabase sukhad jagah maani ja rahi he
 Singapore currently has a People's Action Party government, whose ideological leanings are believed to be right from the Central
 donald trump swayan rhite wing politics karte hai
 -kim's Travel Easy There is also a discussion that Kim Jong's long distance from the out-dated plane of North Korea is not easy
 jiske chalate rajanyik mulaakaat host karne vaale sweden or switzraland jaise desh is list se baahar ho gaye
 However, the name of Mongolia was also discussed earlier
 lekin america ke chir pratidwandi china or rus se ghira yah desh trump ke liye utana mufeed nahin mana gaya, jitani sahmati singapore ko lekar bani
 It is believed that this also became a reason for Singapore being chosen as the host
 singapore jahaan trump or kim jong un kii mulaakaat ke liye sabase behatar asian mulk bataaya ja rahaa he, vahiin iskaa ateet bhi ek baithak kii badi vajah bana he
 The south-east Asian city held historic talks between the leaders of China and Taiwan in 2015, the first time in 60 years between the two countries
 aisi hi mulaakaat ab america or north korea ke bich hone ja rahi he
 Let me tell you that this is the first meeting of a US President with the ruler of North Korea, which is being watched by the whole world

 agar aap pradhanmantri kii baat sunen, to aap dekhenge ki vah maujuuda samay ke anusaar kaam kar rahe or unki ichha desh ko aage le jane kii he
 " sibiefasi ke sadasyon ashok pandit or chandra prakaash dvivedi ne iske adhyaksh pehlaaj nihlani ke kaamkaaj ke tareeke par sawaal uthaaya he, aap is par kya kahenge? is par rathore ne kaha, "sarkari sanstha main ek vyakti kaa vichaar myne nahin rakhata
 All decisions must be taken together
 ek vyakti dwaara uthaae gaya mudda sibiefasi kii pramann prakriya ko nahin darshata
 Their motive may be something else
 " Have you talked to them? Rathore said, "I have spoken to the board members and have clearly stated to them that differences on the professional issue are welcome, but they should settle the issue within the CBFC and not in public places

 In the political battleground of Gujarat, the Congress has decided to contest with JDU rebel leader Chhotubhai Vasava
 vasava gujarat kii ek darjan vidhansabha siten maang rahe the, par congress ne unke liye teen siten chodi hai
 The Congress has decided to secure 27 Scheduled Tribes reserved seats by giving three seats
 chotubhai vasavagujrat ke adivasee samudaayake diggaj netaa maane jate hai
 Let us tell you that JDU MLA Chhotubhai Vasava did the job of crossing the staggered Naiya of Congress veteran Ahmed Patel in Gujarat Rajya Sabha election
 isi ke maddenjar congress ne vasava ke saath vidhansabha chunaav main utarane kaa faisla kiya he
 Chhotubhai Vasava is a rebel MLA from JDU and belongs to the Sharad camp
 pichley dinon chunaav ayog ne tir nishaan par sharad yadav kaa daawa khaarij kar diya he
 In such a situation, Chhotubhai Vasava has created a new political party in Gujarat under the name of 'indian Tribal Party'
 iskaa chunaav nishaan auto he
 In such a situation, Vasava and his candidates have decided to contest on the auto trail
 bataa den ki gujarat main kareeb 12 fisadi adivasee matadaata or rajya kii 27 vidhansabha siten adivaasiyon ke liye arakshit hai
 Congress had won 16 of these 27 seats in the last assembly election
 iske alaava ek seat jediu or 10 seat par bijepi ne jeet darj kii thi
 Congress has left three assembly seats for Vasava this time
 is tarah congress 182 siton main se 179 par ab apane ummidavaar utaaregi
 The Congress has mobilized all the tribal seats through Vasava
 kyonki vasava kaa dakshin gujarat kii adivasee bahulya ilaake vaali siton par kaaphi prabhaav he
 Especially in Baruch, Narmada, Dang district
 gujarat ke adivaasiyon par congress kii majboot pakad he
 This is the reason that despite Narendra Modi being the CM in Gujarat, the Congress dominated the tribal area
 gujarat ke adivaasiyon ke ilaake main aresas jamini str par kaam kar rahaa he
 Despite this, the political dominance of the Congress remains
 aise main congress ne vasava se deal karke sabhi adivasee siton par jeet kaa khwab sanjoya he
 Now it has to be seen how much Vasava provides for the Congress
 tender ke mutabik sarkaar 2000 metrin ton pyaaj kaa aayaat karegeepyaaj ke daam badhane kii vajah se pehle bhi gir chuki he bijepi kii sarkarbharat sarkaar padosi deshon se pyaaj kaa aayaat karne ja rahi he
 This import will be done from onion producing countries like Pakistan, China, Bangladesh, Afghanistan
 6 sitambar, 2019 ko desh kii saarvajanik kshetra kii trending body MMTC Ltd
 According to the tender issued by Metals and Minerals Trading Corporation of India, the government will import 2000 metric tonnes of onions
 sarkaar kaa yah kadam pyaaj kii kami ko puraa karne or badhati keemton ke bich gharelu aapurti ko santulit karne ke liye uthaaya gaya he
 The BJP can never forget that it had lost the government once due to the rise in onion prices
 vartmaan main maalegaanv or lasalgamv ke 14 thok market main pyaaj kii kami he
 On Friday, the price of the best quality onion in the onion market opened at Rs 2930 per quintal
 kuch din pehle sabase acchhee quality ke pyaaj kaa thok bhav 2700 or saadhaaran quality ke pyaaj kaa daam 1400 rupee prati quintal tha
 Experts say that the government's MMTC is taking out open tender to import 2000 MT of onion
 yah pyaaj kii badhati keemton ko niyantrit karne ke liye he
 Experts also say that this will not harm the onion-producing farmers because in view of daily consumption of onion in India, this import is extremely low
 kul milakar bharat main har maheene 15 lakh metric ton pyaaj kii jarurat hoti he
 Normally, in Mumbai alone, one thousand metric tons of onions are consumed every day
 isliye maujuuda halaat main 2000 metric ton pyaaj kaa aayaat, vah bhi november main, hone se pyaaj ke daamon main koi badi giravat nahin aegi
 Nafed director Nanasaheb Patil says that in onion growing areas like Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, new onion crop starts coming from November
 agar tab tak pyaaj kii aapurti main kami aati he to vah nai fasal se puri ho jaaegi
 Therefore MMTC does not need to import additional onions
 pichley do saalon se MMTC ne pyaaj kaa aayaat nahin kiya he kyonki bharat main pyaaj kaa utpaadan paryaapt hua he
 But due to continuous rains this year, onion suffered damage in most markets
 haalanki, aise samay main khud sarkaar ke paas 50 hajaar metric ton kaa bafer stock maujuud he

 27 oktober ko patna main hone vaali hunkaar raily, narendra modi kaa mega sho hoga
 In this rally, party president Rajnath Singh and Arun Jaitley will be on the stage, but Advani and Sushma Swaraj will stay away from it
 modi ke is sho main lag rahe binar postaron se bhi saaf he ki adwani khemaa is raily se darkinar ho chukaa he
 The faces of these two leaders in posters are just a matter of food
 bihari babu jaise adwani kheme ke netaa bhi haashie par hai
 In such a situation, the question is whether the Advani camp is angry with the change of Bihar BJP camp or wants to maintain its relations with Nitish
 hyderabad, rewadi, trichi, bhopal, dilli, kanpur or jhaansi ke baad ab modi 27 oktober ko patna kaa rukh karenge, lekin is hunkaar se pehle hi netaaon kii shirkat ko lekar is par sawaal uthne lage hai
 While Bihar's top leaders are silent on why Advani and Sushma are not coming, CP Thakur, a well-known face of the bjp's national vice president and Modi camp, said he would talk to the party president to bring Advani and Sushma together And try
 yahi nahin unhone apil kii ki adwani or sushamaa ke raily main nahin aane ke faisle par phir se vichaar karen
 The enthusiasm for Modi's rally in Bihar is at its peak
 patna shahar binar or postaron se pat chukaa he, lekin adwani or sushamaa swaraj kii upeksha yahaan saaf jhalkati he
 Except for the pictures released by the state BJP, Advani and Sushma are missing from all the posters and banners
 adwani kheme kaa cheharaa rahe bihari babu ke namo kii taraf paala badalane ke baavjood party ne unki taraf dhyaan nahin diya he
 Even if the picture of Atal Bihari Vajpayee is visible, Advani is missing from the entire rally
 party se baahar kiye gaye netaaon ke mutabik jo log adwani ke liye yahaan morchabandi kar saalon sarkaar main rahe, jab unhone hi paala badal liya to adwani yahaan aaain bhi to kis munh se
 Even after the Bihar bjp's call, Advani and Sushma Swaraj's absence in Patna rally raises many questions
 kya adwani, modi or nitish ke bich ke jhagade main nahin padana chaahate yaa phir adwani nitish ke saath apane sambandhon ko sahejkar rakhana chaahate hai
 Advani is not coming, this is not an issue for Bihar BJP
 wo to bas modi naam main hi mast hai, lekin adwani kheme ne jediyu kii pareshaani badhaa di he
 Even though JDU fires in the name of Modi, the party is unable to say anything in the name of Advani
 kyonki nitish or adwani kii chemistry kisi se chuphi nahin he or argedy ne jediu kii isi kamjor kadi ko pakad liya he
 According to experts, the Advani camp for which Nitish Kumar opposed Modi's name was marginalized
 aise main adwani or sushamaa ne patna na aakar ye sandesh saaf kar diya he ki aaj bhi bijepi main modi ko lekar sab kuch thik-thaak nahin he or raajnneeti ke is bisaat par chunaav baad ke baad kiski shah or kiski maat hogi koi nahin jaanata

 *** When will master blaster Sachin Tendulkar play the last Test match of his career, it is a big question, but former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram wishes that Sachin will play his last Test against Pakistan no matter what
 
 
 kareeb 24 saal pehle november, 1989 main pakistan main karachi ke neshnal stadium main jab 16 saal ke sachin tendulkar safed helmet pahanakar maidan par utre the to pakistan team ke bahut kam khilaadiyon ko is mahaan ballebaaz ke sahi kad kaa andaaza hua hoga
 
 
 Sachin Tendulkar hit two fours in that innings
 
 
 in do shots ne unke balle kii chamak to dikhaai, lekin yah pari behad choti rahi
 
 
 On the other hand, another Pakistani veteran Waqar Younis also had his first Test match, but Sachin hit two fours in the first innings of his first Test and was a victim of Waqar by scoring only 15 runs
 
 
 phir bhi kuch diggajon ne is chote-se kad ke ballebaaz main tabhi se mahaan banane ke lakshan dekh liye the
 
 
 And the journey of batting with the bat started from the National Stadium in Karachi continued for the next 23 years
 
 
 isiilie wasim akram chaahate hai ki sachin tendulkar apana aakhri test bhi pakistan ke khilaaf hi khelen
 
 
 Akram says that Sachin Tendulkar is a great player, and it would be his best farewell if he plays his last Test against Pakistan at the Eden Gardens
 
 
 vaise, test cricket ke itihaas main kai world record banane vaale sachin tendulkar isi saal west indies ke khilaaf apana 200waan test khelkar ek or world record bana lenge
 The comments haalanki bharat or pakistan ke bich varsh 2007 ke baad kisi bhi test match kaa aayojan nahin kiya ja sakaa he, lekin kaha ja rahaa he ki pakistan kii team is saal ke aakhir main limited over series ke liye bharat aa sakati he
 
 
 In such a situation, if Pakistan gets a chance to play a Test match this time, it can become a matter of Wasim Akram
 
 
 lekin vahi sachin kaa aakhri padaav hoga, yah kahana behad mushkil he
 
 
 Perhaps Sachin himself has not decided his last Test match yet
 
 
 udhar, ravi shastri or chetan chouhan jaise diggaj kehete bhi rahe hai ki sachin main ab bhi ranon kii bhukh barkaraar he
 
 
 Fans or experts who keep this in view of Sachin Tendulkar's age, should remember the US Open doubles title winner Leander Paes that forty-one could be number-one
 
 
 wasim akram bharat ke is mahaan ballebaaj kii vidaai kii tasviir to pesh kar rahe hai, lekin kahin akram is tarah sachin ke aakhri test kii baat chhedakar kahin yah sandesh to nahin de rahe ki sachin is saal ke aakhir main yaa varsh 2014 main cricket se sanyas lene kaa faisla kar chuke hai
 When 24-year-old Sachin Tendulkar took to the ground wearing a white helmet at the National Stadium in Karachi in Pakistan, nearly 24 years ago in November 1989, very few players of the Pakistan team would have realized the true stature of this great batsman
 
 
 us pari main sachin tendulkar ne do chauke lagaae
 
 
 These two shots showed the glow of his bat, but this innings was very short
 
 
 udhar, ek anya pakistani diggaj vakaar younus kaa bhi vah pehla test match tha, lekin sachin ne apane pehle test kii pehali pari main do chauke lagaae or sirf 15 ran banaakar vakaar kaa shikaar hue
 
 
 Nevertheless, some veterans had seen signs of becoming great in this short-lived batsman since then
 
 
 or karachi ke neshnal stadium se shuru hua balle se karishmon ke barasane kaa safar agle 23 saal tak jari rahaa
 
 
 That is why Wasim Akram wants Sachin Tendulkar to play his last Test against Pakistan as well
 
 
 akram kehete hai ki sachin tendulkar ek mahaan khilaadi hai, or agar vah pakistan ke khilaaf apana aakhri test eden gardens par khelte hai to yah unki sabase acchhee vidaai hogi
 
 
 By the way, Sachin Tendulkar, who has made many world records in the history of Test cricket, will make another world record by playing his 200th Test against the West Indies this year
 tippaniyan Although no Test match between India and Pakistan has been held since 2007, it is being said that Pakistan's team can come to India for the limited overs series later this year
 
 
 aise main agar is baar pakistan ko test match khilne kaa mauka miltaa he to wasim akram kii baat ban bhi sakati he
 
 
 But that will be Sachin's last stop, it is very difficult to say
 
 
 shaayad apane aakhri test match kaa faisla abhi khud sachin ne bhi na kiya ho
 
 
 On the other hand, stalwarts like Ravi Shastri and Chetan Chauhan have also said that Sachin still has a hunger for runs
 
 
 jo prashansak yaa jaankaar sachin tendulkar kii umr ko nazar main rakhte hue ye baat kehete hai, unhen yues open yugal khitaab vijeta liender pes kii baat yaad rakhni chahie ki chalis ek number-bhar ho saktaa he
 
 
 Wasim Akram is presenting the farewell picture of this great batsman of India, but somewhere Akram is not giving the message that Sachin retired from cricket in the end of this year or in the year 2014, by talking about Sachin's last test
 Have decided to take

 The launch of Chandrayaan-2, the second moon mission of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), has been halted due to technical reasons
 launch se 56
 The countdown to Chandrayaan-2 has been stopped 24 minutes earlier
 agali taarikh kii ghoshnaa jald kii jaaegi
 Chandrayaan-2 in the early hours of 15 July 2
 51 baje desh ke sabase taqatvar bahubali rocket GSLV-MK3 se launch kiya janaa tha
 ISRO scientists are trying to find out where this technical deficiency came from before the launch
 isro pravaktaa biaar guruprasad ne isro kii taraf se bayaan dete hue kaha ki jieselvi-emke3 launch whical (rocket) main khami aane kii vajah se lonching roak di gai he
 The next launch date will be announced soon
 launch se kareeb 56
 Live screening stopped at ISRO Media Center and Visitors Gallery 24 minutes ago
 kami dekhte hi launch kii prakriya roak di gai
 Because of this hindrance, the hard work of 11 years of ISRO scientists has received a small setback
 haalanki, isro vaigyanikon dwaara antim kshanon main yah takneekee kami khoj lenaa bada kadam he
 If the rocket were left with this deficiency, a big accident could have happened
 yah vaigyanikon kii maharath he ki unhone galati khoj lee he
 By fixing this soon they will announce the new date of launch
 ye hai sambhavit kaarankryogenic ingine main liquid hydrogen bharte samay sahi taapmaana yaa dabaav kaa na hona
 Because liquid hydrogen filling was completed just before the countdown was stopped
 bahubali rocket jieselvi-emke3 kii bydaree main dikkat ho sakati he
 a technical snag was observed in launch vehicle system at 1 hour before the launch
 As a measure of abundant precaution, # Chandrayaan2launch has been called off for today
 Revised launch date will be announced later
 — ISRO (@isro)july 14, 2019pichley saal jisat-11 or 2013 main jieselvi-di5 kii lonching bhi taali gai theisse pehle pichley saal jisat-11 ko march-april main bheja janaa tha lekin jisat-6e mishan ke naakaam hone ke baad ise taal diya gaya
 The signal loss from GSAT-6A departing on 29 March caused a disturbance in the electrical circuit
 aisi ashanka thi ki jisat-11 main yahi dikkat saamne aa sakati he, isliye isaki lonching ko roak diya gaya tha
 After this several tests were done and it was found that all the systems are fine
 phir isaki lonching 5 disambar 2018 ko kii gai
 Even at that time, ISRO took a long time to complete the entire investigation process
 isro ne 2013 main jieselvi di-5 rocket kaa prakshepan bhi eendhan risaav ke chalate sthagit kar diya tha
 The announcement was made by the then ISRO chairman k Radhakrishnan
 unhone kaha tha ki eendhan risaav ke chalate ham jieselvi di-5 kaa prakshepan sthagit kar rahe hai
 Now we will take the rocket to the assembly building
 data kaa akalan karenge
 Detect the cause of fuel leakage
 tab bhi lonching tay samay se 74 minute pehle roak di gai thi
 Why Chandrayaan-2 mission is important for ISRO, five big reasons 1
 vaigyanik kshamta dikhaanaa - jab rus ne manaa kiya to ISRO vaigyanikon ne khud banaaya lander-rovernovember 2007 main roosi antariksh agency roscosmos ne kaha tha ki vah is project main saath kaam karegaa
 He will give Lander to ISRO
 2008 main is mishan ko sarkaar se anumati mili
 The design of Chandrayaan-2 was completed in 2009
 janvari 2013 main lonching tay thi, lekin roosi antariksh agency roscosmos lander nahin de pai
 ISRO decided to launch Chandrayaan-2 in March 2018
 lekin kuch test ke liye lonching ko april 2018 or phir oktober 2018 tak taala gaya
 Meanwhile, in June 2018, ISRO decided that Chandrayaan-2 will be launched in January 2019 by making some changes
 phir launch date badhaakar farvari 2019 kiya gaya
 The launch news was also reported in April 2019
 is mishan kii safalataa se yah saaf ho jayega ki hamaare vaigyanik kisi ke mohataaj nahin hai
 They can complete any mission
 kya chand par maanav basti ban paaegi? Chandrayaan-2 se kya he ummid2
 isro's Small Step, Long Jump to Build India Image With its second moon mission Chandrayaan-2, ISRO may be making a small step in the world of space science, but it proves to be a quantum leap to build India's image
 Can
 kyonki abhi tak duniya ke paanch desh hi chand par soft landing kara paae hai
 These countries are - America, Russia, Europe, China and Japan
 iske baad bharat aisa karne vaala chatha desh hoga
 However, Rover is the fourth country to land
 isse pehle america, rus or china chand par lander or rover utaar chuke hai
 From the soldier of the border to the farmer of the farm, how ISRO3 is helpful for everyone
 kathin jagah kaa chunaavah chand par jagah vah chuni, jahaan abhi tak koi desh nahin pahunchaa heisro ke anusaar chandrayan 2 bhartiya moon mishan he jo puri himmat se chand ke dakshini dhruv kshetra main utrega jahaan abhi tak koi desh nahin pahunchaa he yani ki chandramaa kaa dakshini dhruviya kshetra
 Its purpose is to collect information about the moon
 aisi khoj karnaa jinase bharat ke saath hi puri maanavtaa ko phayda hoga
 On the basis of these tests and experiences, necessary major changes will be made in the preparation of future lunar missions
 taaki aane vaale daur ke chandra abhiyaanon main apanaai jane vaali nai technology ko banane or unhen tay karne main madad mili
 ISRO tops in leaving smaller satellite, yet space market share less 4
 sabase taqatvar rocket GSLV mk-iii kaa upyog ho rahaa he chandrayan-2 mishan menkeghshwa mk-iii bharat kaa ab tak kaa sabase shaktishaalee launture he
 It has been made entirely in the country
 teen stage kaa yah rocket 4 hajaar kilo ke upgrah ko 35,786 kimi se lekar 42,164 kimi kii oonchai par sthit jeeosincronas orbit main pahunchaa saktaa he
 Alternatively, a satellite of 10 thousand kg can reach 160 to 2000 km of Low Earth Orbit
 is rocket ke jariye 5 june 2017 ko jiset-19 or 14 november 2018 ko jiset-29 kaa safal prakshepan kiya ja chukaa he
 It is also expected that isro's manned mission Gaganyaan will be dispatched from the state-of-the-art avatar of this rocket
 wo 11 bade maukey jab ISRO ne apni takat se puri duniya ko hairaan kar diya5
 What will isro's Chandrayaan-2 find on the moon, which will surprise the world, and check whether the earthquake on the moon will occur at the same place where the land of Vikram Dekandrayan-2 will land
 vahaan thermal or lunar dencity kitni he
 The rover will chemically examine the lunar surface
 taapmaana or vaataavaran main aadrata (humidity) he ki nahin
 The evidence of water on the lunar surface was discovered by Chandrayaan 1, but from Chandrayaan 2 it can be found that how much of the lunar surface and the subsurface has water

 jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main suraksha balon ke kafile par hue aatanki hamale main 37 jawan shahid ho gaye
 Pakistani terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammad has claimed responsibility for this attack
 yahaan bataanaa jaruri he ki jaish kii sthapana kukhyat aatanki moulana masood ajahar ne kii thi
 This is the same Masood Azhar who was caught by Kashmir in 1994 by the team of current National Security Advisor Ajit Doval
 aatank kii duniya main masood ajahar ke kad kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki use chhudaane ke liye disambar 1999 main aatankiyon ne qandahar vimaan hijank kii ghatana ko anjaam diya
 The then foreign ministers Jaswant Singh and Ajit Doval were also included in the team sent from India to mediate with the terrorists
 vaise to is ghatana ko bees baras biit gaye lekin masood ajahar aaj bhi NSA ajit dobhaal ke liye sirdard bana hua he
 The terror attack in Pulwama has once again put Ajit Doval and Maulana Masood Azhar face to face
 saal 1994 main jab kashmir main masood ajahar ko pakadaa gaya tab uski umr mahaj 26 saal kii thi
 Azhar had entered India as a journalist on the basis of a fake passport from Portugal
 lekin masood ajahar kaa kad kitna bada he iskaa pataa tab chalaa jab ajit dobhaal or unki team ko uske pakistani khufia agency iesai se conection kaa pataa chalaa
 Masood Azhar came at the behest of the ISI at that time with the aim of improving the deteriorating relationship between the terrorist organization harkat-ul-ansar and harkat-ul-mujahideen
 masood ajahar ke pakade jane ke paanch saal baad yani 1999 main indian airlines kii kathmandu se dilli aane vaale IC-814 vimaan kaa hijank hua
 The terrorists conditioned the release of Masood Azhar, Omar Sheikh and Mushtaq Zargar to release 180 passengers aboard the plane
 tab ajit dobhaal or kuch anya adhikariyon ko tatkaaleen videsh mantri jaswant singh ke saath madhyasthata ke liye afghanistan ke qandahar bheja gaya
 In the release of one of his books last year, Ajit Doval revealed that if the Taliban hijackers had not got the help of ISI, we could have ended this crisis
 baharhaal bharat ne tab yatriyon kii suraksha ko zyada praathamikta di
 But exactly two years after this hijack incident, in 2001, Masood Azhar conspired with lashkar-e-taiba leader Hafiz Saeed to attack the country's parliament
 us vakt bhi ajit dobhaal or unki team ko isaki jaanch kaa jimmaa saupa gaya
 But Azhar remained out of reach of India
 saal 2001 main america ke 9 / 11 hamale ke baad duniya kii kai aatanki sanghathanon samet sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ne jaish-e-mohammad ko bhi aatanki sanghathan ghoshit kiya
 After this, Pakistan also banned Jaish in the year 2002
 pratibandh ke baavjood masood ajahar pakistan main khulaa ghumta rahaa or bharat ke khilaaf jehar ugalta rahaa
 During this period, Masood Azhar's name did not appear directly in any major incident in Kashmir
 lekin pichley kuch saalon main bharat main hue do bade aatanki hamalon se ek baar phir masood ajahar ne dastak di he
 The first major attack took place on 2 January 2016 at the Airforce base in Pathankot, Punjab
 is hamale main shaamil jaish-e-mohammad ke sabhi aatanki maare gaye, jabaki 5 jawan shahid hue
 For the elimination of terrorists, the responsibility of operation was given to the Special Squad of NSG and it was directly monitored by Ajit Doval
 yah oparation teen din tak chalaa
 After this attack, Pakistan took Masood Azhar, his brother and other terrorists into custody and sent an ISI team to Pathankot for investigation
 iske baad duusari badi aatanki ghatana jisane puure desh ko hilaa diya, wo thi uri sector ke sena mukhyalay par
 On September 18, 2016, 19 soldiers were killed in a terrorist attack on the local headquarters of the Indian Army located near the loc in Uri sector
 jabaki 4 aatanki maare gaye the
 The plot of this attack was also planned by Masood Azhar sitting in Pakistan
 lekin bhartiya sena ne is hamale kaa badla pakistan kii seemaa me ghuskar sargical strike se diya
 Now once again a major terrorist attack has taken place in Pulwama which is bigger than the attack on army camp in Uri sector
 is hamale kii jimmedaari bhi masood ajahar ke sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ne lee he
 Now call it coincidence or something that the NSA of the country is Ajit Doval 20 years after the Kandhar aircraft hijack incident
 jabaki seemaa ke us paar aatank kaa aakaa masood ajahar apane sanghathan kii safalataa par bharat kii pakad se dur muskura rahaa hoga
 The 720 km long Samundari border of Maharashtra is still not safe
 26 / 11 hamale main mumbai ko lahooluhaan karne vaale aatanki samandar ke raste hi bharat aae the
 After the attack, the promises were made big, but there is not much work on the land, now once again the Maharashtra government is promising to safeguard the sea border again
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne girgaanv choupati se washi tak samandar main safar karke tateey suraksha kii samiksha kii
 After the tour, he said, i took stock of coastal security, i have discussed with the Coast Guard, asked them which are the important locations where security needs to be strengthened
 jald hi coast guard, marine police or sarkaar ke log saath main baithenge or isko majboot banane ke liye jo kadam uthaane hai, vah uthaaenge
 In Mumbai, 26 / 11 terrorists entered Mumbai via the sea
 hamale ke baad samandari seemaa ko mahfuj rakhane ke bade bade vaayade kiye gaye, hamale ke baad samandar main kabhi amphibien boat dikhi, to kabhi speed boat, lekin 2011 main 29 din or 700 notical mil yani lagbhag 1300 kilometre kaa safar tay kar 1000 ton vajani jahaaj amti paavit ne bataa diya kii suraksha ke daawey kitne khokhale hai
 During this period, no Marine Police, nor Navy nor Coast Guard was heard by anyone
 puure maharashtra main kareeb 720 kilometre lanbaa samudri kinaaraa he
 Thousands of Kashmiris come daily to hundreds of small ports built on them
 mumbai samet puure maharashtra ke sabhi kinaaron par najar rakhane ke liye 1358 pulicekarmiyon kii niyukti kaa praavdhaan he, jisamen sirf 470 pulisavaale 24 ghante chaukasee karte hai, 69 petroling boat main aadhe se bhi kam kaam par lage hai, 20 speed boton main sirf 7 se kaam ho rahaa he, baaki karaab hai
 Samandari security in Maharashtra is of three levels, from the shore to the police at five nautical miles, then the Coast Guard, and the Navy has responsibility in the deep sea, the terrorists have succeeded in penetrating all three, despite this the government is only promising every time It is not working

 Keeping the 'motor Vehicles (amendment) Bill-2019' discussed and passed in the House, Gadkari said that the current Motor Vehicle Act is 30 years old
 logon ko bahut asuvidhaayen ho rahi hai
 There have been many complaints of corruption
 aise main is sanshodhan vidheyak kii jarurat padi
 Gadkari said that it is a common belief that it is easiest to get a driving license in India because of official machinery not working properly
 mantri ne sarkari vibhaagon main driveron kii niyuktiyon main dhilaai dikhaane ke liye khud kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki unhen maharashtra main ek sadak durghatana kaa saamana karnaa padaa kyonki unke chaalak ko ek aankh main motiyobind tha, jisaki vajah se vah us aankh se saaf nahin dekh pate the
 He said that a chief minister told him that his driver could not see with both eyes
 vah sunne kii shakti par bharosa karke gaadi chalaata tha
 He assured that the states need not worry about anything
 unke adhikaar kshetra main koi dakhal nahin diya jayega
 The minister said that the system of registration of licenses and vehicles has been made online, which will completely curb corruption
 unhone kaha ki meri taraf se puraa prayaas karne ke baavjood sadak haadason main hone vaali mauton main teen-chaar fisadi kii kami ai hai
 i have failed, i accept it
 yah vidheyak paarit hone se in haadason main hone vaali mauton main bahut kami aegi
 At the same time, Gadkari said that a driving training center will be opened in backward districts and for this his ministry will provide a support of one crore rupees
 unhone kaha ki 2017 main yah vidheyak loksabhaa main paarit hua, lekin mujhe is baat kaa dukh he ki yah rajyasabha main paarit nahin ho paaya

 On the fear of defeat from Varanasi, she said that Priyanka Gandhi will lock herself inside the house on the day Vadra is afraid of defeat
 priyanka gandhi ne india today group ke kansalting editor rajdeep saradesai se vishesh baatcheet main har sawaal ke bebaaki se jawaab diya
 Priyanka, while speaking on the issue of farmers and her decision not to contest elections, said, 'I consulted everyone, especially the leaders of Uttar Pradesh, to contest elections from Varanasi
 sabhi netaaon ne salaah di ki aap varanasi se chunaav ladengi to vahiin tak simit ho kar rah jaaengi
 In such a situation, we want you to campaign for us by not contesting elections and play an important role in winning
 iske baad hamane chunaav nahin ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 On the question of fear of defeat from Varanasi, Priyanka Gandhi said that the day Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will be afraid of defeat, on that day she will lock herself inside the house
 mujhe kabhi haar kaa dar nahin rahaa he
 i have come to fight and i am going to campaign everywhere
 unhone kaha ki priyanka gandhi ab kahin nahin jane vaali hai
 i will stay here and fight the BJP all my life

 Priyanka Gandhi herself, while talking to party workers in Rae Bareli, hinted at contesting elections from Varanasi

 upachunaav main bijepi ke kharaab pradarshan ko lekar shivasena ne use apane 'pair jameen par rakhane' kii naseehat di or kaha ki use isse sabak lenaa chahie
 An editorial in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana said, "the BJP had won a big victory in Uttar Pradesh in the Lok Sabha elections, but now the results of the by-election have been opposite
 yah maharashtra ke chunaav ke liye ek sabak he
 This is a lesson for everyone
 logon ko halke main mat lijie
 "it said," People's mind is unstable
 yah unka faisla he
 The by-election results are a lesson for the Maharashtra Assembly elections to be held on October 15
 yah sabake liye ek sabak he
 " shivasena ne kaha, "apane pair jameen par rakho
 (lok Sabha elections) Don't fly in the wind of victory
 is sabak ko seekhney vaale hi maharashtra kaa chunaav jeetenge
 Otherwise the public will do what is necessary
 " bijepi ko uttar pradesh, rajasthan or gujarat main vidhansabha siton par hue upachunaav main baari nuksaan uthaanaa padaa he or vah purv main apane paas raheen 23 main se 13 siten haar gai he
 The Congress has performed surprisingly in the by-elections in Rajasthan and Gujarat
 saamana main kaha gaya, "upachunaav ke parinaamon ko modi lahar se nahin jod janaa chahie
 It should be remembered that there are differences between general elections and state elections
 " It added, "modi is doing a good job internationally
 " isane kaha ki yadi modi kaa 100 din kaa kaam logon tak nahin pahunchaa, to iske liye koun jimmedaar hona chahie? shivasena ne kaha ki yogi adityanath ne 'lav jihad' kaa mudda uthaaya, lekin upachunaav ke parinaamon se dikhaa ki is mudde kaa koi asar nahin hua
 It said, no one should attribute the performance of Congress in the recent by-elections to either Sonia or Rahul Gandhi
 isi tarah, kisi ko yah daawa bhi nahin karnaa chahie ki janadesh modi ke khilaaf he
 The stern comment made in the Shiv Sena editorial is being seen as a warning to the BJP to keep its voice silent to demand more seats in Maharashtra
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah dwaara aaj mumbai main varisht party netaaon ke saath baithak main shivasena se seat saajha kiye jane ke mudde par charchaa kiye jane kii ummid he

 The political storm in Maharashtra has started with the resignation of Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar
 gauratlab he ki rajya main sinchai ghotaale ke lekar unpar sawaal uthaae gaye hai
 Pawar resigned after Vijay Pandhare's letter about this
 ajit pavaar maharashtra sarkaar main ensipi cote se mantri hai or kendriya krishi mantri sharad pavaar ke bhattije hai

 There were allegations that the ratio of expenses did not work

 Allegations were also made that the proposals were passed by increasing the cost of the dams that have been built in Vidarbha and Raigad districts
 sinchai vibhaag ke ek purv ejeeniyar ne to chitthee likh kar ye bhi aarope madh die the ki kai aise dam banaae gaye jisaki jarurat nahin thi or wo netaaon ke dabaav main banaae gaye the
 The engineer also wrote that many dams have been made weak
 gauratlab he ki pichley kuch dinon se maharashtra ke siem prithviraj chavaan, ajit pavaar ke khilaaf shwet patr laane kii baat bhi kar rahe the
 In such a situation, it is believed that Ajit Pawar will stay out of the cabinet and wait for the white paper
 mana ja rahaa he ki ajit pavaar apana istipha waapas nahin lenge
 Because NCP does not want to give this message that it has any deal with Congress

 aatankwaad nirodhak morche ke pramukh maninderjeet singh bitta ne sansad par hamale ke sajeeshkarta afjal guru ko faansee diye jane ke sarkaar ke kadam kaa swaagat kiya he
 Maninderjeet Singh Bitta has said that the time has come when other dreaded terrorists should also be hanged immediately
 bitta ne bataaya, ‘sarkaar kaa yah kadam behatar he
 In this case, the policy adopted by the government to work without making noise, it is praiseworthy
 ab samay aa gaya he jab duusare sajayaftaa khoonkhaar aatankwaadiyon ko bhi bina kisi deree ke faansee par lataka diya janaa chahie
 Asked if he would demand the execution of the notorious terrorist Balwant Singh Rajoana, who was involved in the conspiracy to assassinate former Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh, and Devender Pal Singh Bhullar, convicted for the bomb blast in front of the Youth Congress office, Bitta said, 'why these two, all terrorists should be hanged immediately
 main sabko latakaane kii maang karata hum
 Asked if there was a big 'uproar' in Punjab for this, Bitta said, 'making noise and creating a ruckus will do nothing
 aise logon ko yah samaj lenaa chahie ki aatankwaadiyon ko kisi surat main nahin bakhsha ja saktaa he
 The government should immediately arrange to hang not only both of them, but all the terrorists
 bitta ne kaha, ‘bina shor machaaye kaam karne kaa sarkaar kaa tarika badhiya he
 Similarly, other terrorists should also be hanged
 ’ unhone yah bhi kaha ki desh kii asmita se jude aise maamalon main ‘raajnneeti’ ko nahin ghusaanaa chahie or yah bhi nahin kaha janaa chahie ki raajnneetik laabh ke liye afjal ko faansee par latakaaya gaya he
 Bitta said that just as Ajmal Kasab has been implemented first and now in the case of Afzal Guru, the decision of the Supreme Court has been implemented, similarly in other cases also the government should execute the decision of the Supreme Court

 You might have seen Narendra Modi's apps so far, but to bring Modi to the Red Fort, a new game has come in the apps, in which Modi reaches the Red Fort through different states like Gujarat, Maharashtra
 yuva ise kaaphi pasand kar rahe hai to vahiin congress ko bharosa he ki jaise game main level khatm naa hone par modi girte hai usee tarah modi 2014 ke chunaav main bhi girenge
 This is the first time for Ahmedabad's young voter Earth Vaishnav that he will vote for the first time after he turns 18

 khilne vaale maanate hai ki game to kaaphi dilachasp he lekin modi 2014 main vahaan dilli tak pahunchate hai wo dekhnaa dilachasp hoga
 At the same time, the Congress believes that the way Modi falls in the game will fall in the 2014 elections as well, while the BJP tells it to the desire of Modi among the youth

 Madhya Pradesh is in the grip of severe water crisis these days
 shahar or gaanvon main pani ke liye traahi-traahi machi he
 More than three and a half urban bodies of the state are unable to provide water in the morning and evening
 kuch jagahon par teen to kahin do din chhodkar pani diya ja rahaa he
 The same situation is in villages, where some places have to cross the border of the state to bring water
 to kahin sookhe kune main utarkar pani laana padataa he
 Know why
 
 
 kyonki sarkari tijori se pichley 15 saalon main lagbhag 35,000 karod rupee kharch hue lekin pani mila sirf chah fisadi gramin aabaadi ko hi
 Despite spending so much money to send water from the tap, 6-year-old Devraj struggles for hours instead of the playground in Palda village, just 9 kilometers from Malwa district headquarters, so that a bucket of water can fill the house quickly
 Arrived, emptied the utensils, again on the tap for the same struggle
 
 
 yah kahani roj kii he
 In this village, the streaks of sweat on the face of 70-year-old Dhapo Bai are hiding the age, but after two hours of exercise, the happiness that is there is not hiding
 ghar par aaraam karne kii umr he, lekin is tarah pani ke liye jaddojahad zindagi kaa hissaa he
 There is no age bar, children, old and young, everyone has equal participation in this water fight
 dhai hajaar aabaadi vaale palda gaanv main kareeb darjan bhar handpump or tubewel hai jo ki garmi shuru hote hi sab dam tod dete hai
 Three years ago, the work of Nal Jal Yojana started with Rs 1
5 crore, but the water in the houses has not reached till today
 katni jile main saansad adarsh gram tha devari, pani ke liye saansad ji ne do tankiyaan lagavaayin
 Still people go 3-4 kilometers on foot to quench thirst
 yahi haal zile ke barhi tehsil main bhi he, jahaan handpump hai vahaan ganda pani aata he,pipe line bichaai gai he lekin ab tak chaalu nahin hui he
 Stop dams have been made in the rivers but there is no water, where there is water, it is fighting the fight for its existence in the grip of encroachment
 devas zile main tanker pahunchate hi, maahaul ek ajibo-garib mashin main tabdeel ho jaataa he
 
 
 Pipe and bucket difficult to identify, but this is the destiny of people in every summer season
 bundelkhand pani kii kami se jujhane ke liye abhishpt he
 The tap water scheme to be made under the Bundelkhand package is not in a working condition in Chhatarpur district, all are closed
 badvani kaa nagalwari, durgam ilaaka he log patharile raaston se pine kaa pani bharte hai, ek-ek gadde se chaanakar 
 
 
 But dirty
 kya karen, sarkaar 1000 karod kii sinchai pariyojna banane kii baat kah rahi he
 Water crisis has taken a severe form in Dindori district these days
 log boond boond pani ke liye jaddojahad karte najar aa rahe hai
 Almost all water sources are on the verge of drying up
 gaanv main handpump hawa ugal rahe hai
 Where there is water, there is also a dispute
 pichley dinon pani kii samasya se jujh rahe kudawari gaanv ke logon ne to ghanton dindori-shadol maarg ko jam kar diya tha
 Villagers of Dewalpur are also struggling with some similar problems
 gram main naljal yojana hone ke baad bhi logon ko peyajal uplabdh nahin ho rahaa he
 In Sarsatal, middle-aged Manglu went out in search of water, he died after falling into a dry well
 gaanv ke dalchand namdev kehete hai usne jhaanka hoga, balance nahin hone kii vajah se kune main gir gaya
 At the same time, Additional Superintendent of Police Shivkumar Singh said that there is a water crisis, but we are looking at the road seriously how this incident happened
 shahpura tehsil main log kune par kapadaa dhankkar pani kii suraksha kar rahe hai
 To say, Bhind district Chambal, Quari and Sindh are surrounded by these three rivers
 
 
 bhind kii gohad vidhansabha main do dam bhi hai baavjood iske gohad ke kai gaanv aaj khaare pani kii samasya se jujh rahe hai
 Even people have to struggle for drinking water and are responsible that the schemes are run only on paper
 barthra gaanv ke log pani bharne 3 kilometre dur sisonia jate hai
 The villagers say that the situation is such that people do not want to add a relationship here
 jila panchayat siio kaa kahana he jald se jald logon kii samasya dur karne kii koshish kii jaaegi
 In Narsinghpur district, water tanks being constructed under the Jalavardhan Yojana of the government to bring Narmada water from door to door caused corruption in the water tanks
 pani supplai se pehle hi tankiyon main daraar aa gai, wo jhukne lageen
 The pipeline has to be brought from Chinki Ghat to Narmada at a cost of Rs 30 crore
 
 
 do saal pehle yojana ko puraa hona tha adhuri he
 
 
 The scheme is running late everywhere in Kareli, Gadarwara
 puure jile main narmada main khanan se nadi sankat main he
 The existence of the river is threatened by crores of schemes and drawing water
 singrauli jile ke devsar kii surat 70 saalon se nahin badali he
 People are forced to drink the water of dirty sewer, go long distances to fill water in the scorching sun
 rajya ke lagbhag har sambhag kii kahani aapane sun leen, ab bataate hai ye halaat kyon hai
 Government of India figures say that only 12% of the rural population has got drinking water available in Madhya Pradesh
 isamen se chah fisadi yojanaayen 2003 kii hai
 While, on an average, two and a half thousand crores were spent annually on water schemes
 ghotaale sirf yojanaon main nahin, pani ke parivahan ke naam par bhi hua
 Scrutiny of the documents revealed that water was supplied from tankers in more than 100 bodies in the last two years, but this time despite the severe water crisis, 32 bodies needed to transport water, the audit revealed that in two years Many bodies supplied with tankers where there was availability of drinking water
 shivaraj singh ne 2012 main jal nigam banaaya jisane 6 saalon main sirf 700 gaanvon tak pani pahunchaaya
 The government is now finding out which water source was made, when it was spent
 aise maamalon kii jaanch kii jaaegi jahaan baari kharch ke baavjood sthiti kharaab he
 PHE Minister Sukhdev Panse said that BJP only gave speech in 15 years
 
 
 dharaatal par shunya hai, aaj halaat gramin anchal main 15 saal main jo kaam hua wo bhrashtachar kii bali chadh gaya 
 
 
 When the Congress left in 2003, water was supplied to 6 percent households through the tap water scheme; 15 years passed, only 12 percent were brought in while crores of rupees were spent every year
 bundelkhand package main karodon rupee aae inaki ham jaanch karavaaenge, jaanch ke baad sakht se sakht karrwai karenge
 The situation is that drinking water schemes have been completed in 197 bodies of the state, and drinking water schemes are incomplete in 181 bodies
 gaanvon main 15787 nal-jal yojanaayen hai, jisamen 1450 nal-jal yojanaayen purnat: band hai, 600 yojanaayen bhu-jalastr girane se band ho chuki hai
 It is no wonder now that the wires of thousands of crores of e-tendering scams in the state also came out of drinking water supply
 23 june ko rajgad ke baandh se hazaar gaanvon main peyajal supplai karne kii yojana kaa shilanyas pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kiya lekin usase pehle ye baat pakad main ai ki i-prokorment portal main chhedchhad kar lok swasthya yantriki yani piechai vibhaag ke 3000 karod rupee ke teen tenderon ke rate badale gaye hai
 However, Shivraj's warlord minister, who was responsible for water resources at that time, is saying that he is not afraid of any investigation, BJP MLA Narottam Mishra said that drinking water, from the same water body we had planned, every village will have water from a tap bottle Implemented the scheme across the state
 ham kise audit se nahin darate ham kisi cheez se nahin darate har cheez ke liye saamne khadey hai, aapke dwaara bhi vaise bhi
 Madhya Pradesh is at number 17 in the country in terms of providing water to the people of the state, the state government is now talking of implementing the 'right to water' law, under which a family will have water availability throughout the year
 congress upi main bhale hi akele dam par vidhansabha chunaav ladane kaa daawa kar rahi ho, lekin andarkhaane mayawati kii bispi se talmail kaa blue print bhi taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 It is said that making Ghulam Nabi Azad the general secretary in-charge of UP is also part of this strategy
 darasal,gulam nabi ajadaur mayawati ke rishte aapas main kaaphi achche maane jate hai
 When the Congress reached a compromise with the BSP in 1996, Azad was in charge of UP
 lekin party or khud aaazaad ko ehsaas he ki jab tak mayawati ko yah ehsaas nahin hoga ki wo akeledam satta nahin paa sakengi, vah samjhaute ke liye taiyaar nahin hongi
 a large section of the party believes that like Bihar, stopping BJP in UP can be a profitable deal
 pehle apni takat dikhaane kii taiyaaricangras mayawati ko apni takat kaa ehsaas karwaane ke liye muhim main jutana chaahati he
 The party's policy is to make its presence felt across the state, so that Mayawati feels that if there is no alliance, she can stay away from power
 congress ke netaa andarkhaane bijepi ke baari-bharkam prachaar abhiyaan or hindu-muslim siyasat se bhi bispi ko aagaah kar rahe hai
 Fazihat also feels that the departure of leaders like Swami Prasad Maurya and RK Chaudhary is also a setback for the BSP
 aise main aane vaale vakt main bijepi kaa dar or khud keeparty kii kamajorike kaaran mayawati samjhaute ke liye hami bhar sakati hai
 But if Maya does not stubbornly compromise, the Congress may be troubled
 aise main philhal congress ke netaa akele chunaav ladane kii baat kar rahe hai or bispi se gathjod ke sawaal par kuch bolnaa nahin chaahate
 The number of seats is a problem Sabarulh Gandhi has been saying in mutual meetings till now that the major reason for the bad condition of Congress in UP was the agreement with BSP in 1996 assembly
 tab congress 125 siton par chunaav ladi or baaki par congress kaa danda jhanda gaayab ho gaya
 On the other hand, Mayawati believes that bsp's vote is transferred to Congress, but Congress's vote is not transferred to BSP
 yani kul milkaar congress akele aage badhate hue dikhnaa chaahati he, lekinbspike saath talmail ko lekar 'dekho or intjaar karo' kii niti par he

 However, Sikh Federation president Bhai Amrik Singh said, "this was a big lapse of a top civil servant and it is completely unacceptable

 Narasimha Rao's government also implemented
 afsos kii baat he ki pichhali july main narsingh raav ke shuru kiye gaye aarthik sudhaaron ko 20 saal puure hue

 The lesson Rajiv Gandhi learned from his first five-year tenure was that a more liberal economy grows faster and generates more jobs

 The newspaper has said that it is difficult to tell whom Farik was trying to call, as sources have not shared details of the investigation

 Opposition parties are attacking the government over cabinet expansion and are trying to divert attention from important issues
 vipakshi dalon ne modi sarkaar par hamalaa karte hue cabinet main pherbadal ko girti vikaas dar or notebandi ke fail hone se dhyaan hataane kii koshish qaraar diya he

 Sitaram Yechury said that 6 big ministers of Modi cabinet comment on social media about demonetisation which was exactly the same

 Now, in such a situation, who is the minister, what difference does it make

 Speaking on the question of evaluating the work of the ministers for the reshuffle in the Modi cabinet, Yechury said that if the work is being done by evaluating the changes, then why was there no change in the Prime Minister's Office

 Accusing the government, Azaz said that Kashmir is burning and in the current government, the death toll of the soldiers on the border is increasing rapidly, the government should pay attention to all these issues

 Renowned comedian Raju Srivastava expressed concern about the state of Humor in the present day
 ek kissa saajha karte hue unhone kaha- hamaara samaaj is tarah kaa he ki bahu ke hansane par use saas se fatkaar milti he
 Raju said, 'it used to happen in earlier times, even today there are many places that if daughter-in-law is laughing loudly, mother-in-law scolds her
 kahati he ki tumhe shame nahin aa rahi he
 Your father-in-law is sitting in that room and you are laughing so loudly
 log hansane ko bed manurs maanate hai
 The thinking of those people is that it is a bad thing to laugh

 This session was conducted by Nidhi Asthana

 Raju Srivastava on what he thinks about the change in Humor Raju said, "laughter was the last to be accepted in our country
 puraanon main jaae to aap dekhenge ki ravan kii jab entry hoti he to tahaakon ke saath entry hoti he
 His demons also enter with a laugh
 gabbar bhi hansata he or moghambo bhi hansata he
 Perhaps people do not laugh because it is the villain's job to laugh
 ""lekin aisa nahin he
 Laugh out loud aajkal jagah jagah lofter club ho gaye hai
 It is necessary to laugh
 maine dekha he parkon main log nakli hansate hai
 Fake laughter is beneficial, so imagine how much it will be in real laughter
 maine ye bhi kaha he ki hameshaa hansane hasane se kaam nahin chalata he
 It also needs seriousness
 ye bhi jaruri he
 "" Earlier, joint families were family, then it was more fun
 chachaa ne koi baat kar di to majaa aa rahaa he
 That natural laughter is missing
 kai tivi shoj achche hai
 But all the things are missing in the race to make early
 "mobile yug main hansanaa bhul gaye lograju shrivastavane kaha, "is daur main kamedi kaa vinaash bhi he or vikaas bhi
 Nowadays everyone is laughing alone
 tahaakaa kya laga rahe hai darasal, muskura rahe hai
 The joint family is no longer there
 log mobile dekhakar muskura rahe hai
 Laughter has become a sorrow for the people
 ""dukh kii baat he ki desh main amir log khul kar nahin hansate
 Keep on laughing
 hansi kii baat kehane vaala unase zyada shaktishaalee he to hasenge, lekin kisi saadhaaran ke kehane par nahin hansate
 Such people also follow protocols at home
 ""pichley dinon main army ke bich tha

 patiala house court main deshadroh ke aaropee jeenyu chaatrasangh ke adhyaksh kanhaiya kumaar kii peshi ke dauraan hamale ke peeche gahari sajeesh thi
 Under the Operation Patiala House Court, the investigation by the intelligence camera revealed the truth to the accused lawyers
 vakeelon ne kabool kiya ki kaise police ke daawey ke ulat na sirf court parisar main kanhaiya ko peeta gaya, balki is dauraan police bhi chupchaap tamashbin bani rahi
 Three attorneys had hatched the conspiracy court: black-coat Vikram Singh Chauhan, Yashpal Singh and Om Sharma took up the law against Kanhaiya, accused of treason in a court of law
 'aaj tak' kii special investigeshan team ne adaalat main kanoon ke khilaaf khuli baghawat karne vaale in teenon aropiyon ko khoj nikaala
 The three themselves began to unravel in a sting operation, day by day, on a conspiracy to attack in broad daylight
 kanhaiya kii hui thi jamkar pitayeeharyana ke rewadi ke rahane vaale vikram singh chouhan ke chehre se pardaa utraa to usne police suraksha kii sari kalai kholkar rakh di
 Chauhan said in front of the camera, 'we beat Kanhaiya for three hours
 uskobharat mata kii jaibolne kaha
 He shouted slogans
 tab jaakar use choda
 Chauhan said that he beat Kanhaiya so much that his pants became wet
 police kii thi mileebhagatchouhan kaa sansanikhej khulaasa police par bade sawaal khadey karti he
 Was the police also involved in the conspiracy to attack and it is a false claim that Kanhaiya was not assaulted
 use lagi chotein bahut maamuli hai
 The disclosure of Vikram Singh Chauhan reveals that Khaiya kept beating in the court and the police was sitting hand in hand
 chouhan ke mutabik, 'bharat hoga to samarthan milegaa
 CRPF personnel were also present there
 bulaae jane par unhone uniform kaa hawala diya
 'boys were called from outside, when the anger of the lawyers was attacking Bhikanhaiya in the court, then this crowd also included people called in black coats from outside
 un logon kaa iraadaa hi tha ki deshadroh ke aaropee ko nahin chodenge
 Chauhan told that we had invited many boys from places like Dwarka, Rohini
 maine fasebuk par likhakar unhen bulaayaa tha
 There were only a hundred and fifty lawyers in the Patiala House Court
 unamem se aadhe to chaalaanon main biji the
 The conspiracy of the lawyers is dangerous, the police filed a case against the lawyers and granted them bail, but the motives of the lawyers are still dangerous
 vikram singh chouhan ne sting main agali peshi par khatarnaak sajeesh kaa khulaasa bhi kar diya
 Chauhan said that we want to do something different, something bigger
 agali peshi or tihaad main bhi kanhaiya par mandara rahaa khatrasaaf he ki patiala house court main kanhaiya kii agali peshi par bhi hangaamaa ho saktaa he
 If this happens then who will guarantee security to the accused of treason in court? The larger conspiracy than the dangerous intentions of Vikram Singh Chauhan is that even behind Tihar, Kanhaiya's life is under threat
 esaiti padtaal main saaf ho gaya ki patiala house court main hamale kii sajeesh vakeelon ne behad sangeen tareeke se rachi
 The sources of the conspiracy of the lawyers have not stopped

 Sharma has been practicing in the Patiala House Court for 17 years
 usee ke saath yashpal singh bhi mili jo tees hajaari court main practice karte hai or baar council kaa adishnal secetry rah chukaa he
 The two made sensational disclosures on their connivance with the khaki uniform in the plot to attack Kanhaiya
 murder kaa charge manjuur par kanhaiya ko maarengein logon ne bataaya, 'kanhaiya kya he
 There were more than a thousand soldiers of the security forces there
 police, siaisef, siarpief vagairah ke javaanon ne kaha ki agar ham vardi main nahin hote to ham bhi peetate, lekin kamaane-khaane ke chakkar main lage hai
 Yashpal Singh claimed that the next time accused of treason will be attacked by a petrol bomb
 yashpal ne kaha, 'ham use chodenge nahin
 We will run a petrol bomb
 mere khilaaf kya cese hoga mujhe isaki parvaah nahin he
 Even if i get charged for the murder, i will not leave it
 'kaale kot main aa sakati he mediasting oparation main vakeelon ne yahaan tak daawa kiya ki wo jamaanat tudwakar jail jane kii bhi taiyaari kar rahe hai, taaki kanhaiya ko uski cell main ghuskar maar saken
 Yashpal Singh said that we can go to jail for a day or two by not filling our bond
 vakeelon ne phir se kanoon ko todane kii taiyaari kar rakhi he
 He has claimed that the media can be present during beating in black coats
 kiske bharose hogi aropiyon kii surakshadonon vakeelon ne chupe camere ke saamne bataaya ki koun se chehre the jinhone patrakaron ko peeta, jeenyu ke prophessoron ko peeta or jo bhi desh ke khilaaf bolegaa, un sabko bhi bakhshane vaale nahin he
 In Patiala House Court, the entire raw letter of the lawyers who took up the law has been exposed
 sawaal he ki adaalat main hamalavar vakeelon ke agar yahi tevar hai or police kaa haal behaal he to phir deshadroh ke aropiyon kii suraksha aakhir kiske bharose hogi? supreme court kii jaanch team par bhi pathar or bottlen phenkane main vakil peeche nahin the

 It has been started by the leaders of the Advani camp
 bijepi main baghawat kii pehali jhalak somvaar der raat party ke sansadeey board kii baithak main dekhne ko mili
 According to sources, in this meeting, Sushma Swaraj, Anant Kumar and Venkaiah Naidu expressed displeasure over Modi's coronation in the absence of Advani
 in netaaon kaa kahana tha ki modi kii tajposhi ko lekar party ko is tarah kii hadabadi dikhaane kii jarurat nahin thi
 If sources are to be believed, Sushma, Ananth Kumar and Venkaiah Naidu took on other leaders in the meeting
 unka kahana tha ki modi kii tajposhi kii vajah se aaj party is vivaad main padi he
 The decision taken regarding Modi was shown to be needless haste
 gaur karne vaali baat he ki goa main 8-9 june ko bijepi kaaryakarini kii baithak ke dauraan bhi in netaaon ne hi adwani kii anupasthiti main modi ko kaman dene par sawaal uthaae the
 These leaders said that it would be better if Modi was made the chairman of the election campaign committee in the presence of Advani
 virodh ke swar mangalvaar ko bhi sunaae die
 Jaswant Singh, who is considered to be a supporter of Advani, said that the things that Advani said are correct and these questions should be resolved
 sawaal yah he ki adwani kis kaaran se naaraaz hai? modi kii tajposhi, yaa phir bijepi ke kaam-kaaj main aresas kii dakhal se
 Or both
 sutron kii maane to adwani kii naaraazgi kaa mukhya kaaran to aresas kaa ravaiya he or aag main ghi daalane kaa kaam modi kii tajposhi ne kiya
 Meanwhile, the exercise to celebrate Advani continues for the second consecutive day

 At the same time, BJP spokesman Prakash Javadekar hoped that the party will find a solution on this issue and soon the good news will be found
 adwani ko manaane kii koshishon ke bich party adhyaksh rajnath singh rajasthan ke bansawada main maharana pratap kii pratimaa kaa anaavaran karne ke liye chale gaye hai
 Before leaving, he described the news related to RSS in Advani case as baseless
 haalanki ve adwani ko manaane par kuch nahin bole
 Significantly, there were reports on Monday night that the RSS has directed the party to make every effort to convince Advani but the decision taken on Modi will not be returned
 bijepi kii pareshaani yaheen khatm nahin ho rahi he
 The opposition is also not missing an opportunity to pinch the entire controversy
