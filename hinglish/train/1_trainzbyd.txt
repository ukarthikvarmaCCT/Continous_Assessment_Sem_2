 is baar modi varanasi seat se or bhi bade antar se jite to lekin purvanchal kii 4 mahatvapurn siten azamgarh, gajipur, ghosi or jonpur haar baithe
 These seats were not affected by Modi's tsunami and the SP-BSP alliance won this seat
 azamgarh seat ko chhodkar purvanchal kii anya sabhi loksabhaa siton par bijepi ne modi lahar main jeet darj kii thi
 But now when it is said that the Modi wave turned into a tsunami in 2019, the bjp's grip loosened from Purvanchal

 sapa-basapa or ralod gathbandhan ke pratyaashee afjaal ansaari is seat se jeetne main kaamyaab ho chuke hai
 Manoj Sinha is also a Union Minister
 manoj sinha ne sapa pratyaashee shivakanya kushvaha ko 32,452 maton ke antar se haraaya tha

 bijepi ke krishna pratap singh ne bahujan samaaj party ke subhash pandey ko 1,46,310 maton ke antar se haraaya tha
 3,67,149 to Krishna (36
 45%) mat mili jabaki subhash pandey ko 2,20,839 (21
 93%) votes were received
 is baar party kii ore se kaha ja rahaa tha ki modi lahar ab tsunami main tabdeel ho chuki he lekin yahaan tsunami gathbandhan kii baandh ke aage bebas najar ai

 Modi tsunami also could not save 3 important seats of Purvanchal
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan in siton par modi lahar par baari padaa

 bhartiya janata party(bijepi) ke sheersh netritv ne yah faisla yun hi nahin kiya tha
 In the Modi wave, the party leaders were confident that if Modi himself contested from a seat in Purvanchal, it would easily take many seats around the region to the bjp's account
 2014 main azamgarh sansadeey seat ko chhod diya jaae to purvanchal kii sabhi siton bijepi ne jeet darj kii thi
 In 2014, the then Samajwadi Party chief and former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mulayam Singh contested from Azamgarh Lok Sabha seat
 unke saamne bijepi ke ramakant yadav chunaav lade
 Mulayam Singh defeated Ramakant Yadav in the elections, but the margin of victory was only 63,204
 ise modi lahar kaa asar bhi kaha ja saktaa tha ki mulaayam singh jaise diggaj netaa ke jeet kaa antar itnaa kam rahaa ho
 But this time due to the arrival of Akhilesh Yadav, the margin of victory against BJP has become even bigger
 modi kii tsunami main bhi 3 siten gathbandhan chhinane main safal ho gaya

 The second semi-final of this World Cup is to be played between India and Australia on 26 March and preparations have already started inside and outside the ground
 team india Has also reached Sydney, but there is no plan to practice it for a day or two
 vahiin is muqaabale ke liye australia ne maid-games khilne shuru kar die hai
 On reaching Sydney, Maxwell gave a statement that there is no need to fear India, as he has been beating India in almost every format for three months before that
 maxewal ne kohli ke bare main bhi kaha ki kohli ke khilaaf australian gendbaaj kaamyaab rahe hai or unke bare main team meeting main ranneeti bana lee jaaegi
 Meanwhile, everyone is eyeing the pitch of the semi-final match to be played in Sydney and there could be a lot of debate in the next few days
 khabaren hai ki australia ke captain maaikel clark sidney kii pich, jo aamtaur par spin gendbaajon ko madad karti he, use badalanaa chaahate hai
 Clarke wants this pitch to be adapted to the fast bowlers and to leave a little grass on it, which can help the fast bowlers
 kangaaroon kii team main stark, johnson or hejalwood jaise gendbaaj hai, jo kisi bhi madad kaa puraa phayda uthaane main sakasham hai
 But if the pitch helped the spin, then Australia has no spinner who can control India
 australia ke khilaaf quarter final muqabla haarane vaali pakistan team ke captain bhi ye baat kah chuke hai ki sidney main bharat ke spin gendbaaj australia ko pareshaan kar sakate hai
 That is why Australia captain Michael Clarke wants to keep the pitch green
 lekin kehete hai na, jo dusron ke liye gaddha khodta he, wo khud usamen gir jaataa he
 The pace of Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav and Mohit Sharma of India can make them even more dangerous on a fast pitch and Australia can get caught in their own woven net
 kul milakar itnaa to tay he clark kii chintaa ne ye to bataa diya he ki semifinal muqabla main dabaal gharelu team par kuch zyada he

 The role of madrasas in the Revolt of 1857 and other colonial movement is a well-established fact
 aise main gupta jaise logon ke bayaan se koi fark nahin padataa
 Madrasas have played an important role in the national movement
 unhone kaha ki british raaj main moulana barkatulla bhopali, moulana obaidullah sindhi, shaikh-ul-islam moulana hossain ahamed madani, moulana wahid ahamed faijabadi, moulana azaad gul or hakim said nusrat hossain apni bhoomika ke liye jail kii hawa khaani padi thi

 The Navratri of Maa Durga, which comes in the month of Chaitra, has started and along with this, both the devotion and strength of the mother begins to be spoken
 mana jaataa he ki navadurga kii puja maa ke shakti swaroop kii ko prasann karne ke liye kii jaati he
 Who does not know the glory of the mother but it becomes a little easier for the devotees to know and understand them through the stories related to them
 aaie jaane navadurga se judi 3 pramukh kathaon ke bare main
 
 
 According to the first story, in the battle of Lanka, Brahmaji asked Shri Ram to please Goddess by worshiping Chandidevi for Ravana-slaughter, and according to the description, a rare 108 Nilkamal was arranged for Chandi Pujan and Havan, on the other hand, Ravana also in the greed of immortality Started Chandi text with Vijay Kamna
 yah baat indra dev ne pawan dev ke madhyam se shriram ke paas pahunchaai or paraamarsh diya ki chandi paath yathasambhav purna hone diya jaae
 Here a Neelkamal from the place of worship in the havan material disappeared from the elusive power of Ravana and the resolve of Rama began to appear broken, fearing that the goddess mother might not be angry
 durlabh neelkamal kii vyavastha tatkaal asambhav thi, tab bhagwaan ram ko sahaj hi samaran hua ki mujhe log kamalnayan navkanch lochan kehete hai, to kyon na sankalp purti hetu ek netra arpit kar diya jaae or prabhu raaj jaise hi tunir se ek baan nikaalkar apana netra nikaalane ke liye taiyaar hue tab devi ne prakat ho haath pakadakar kaha- ram main prasann hum or vijayshri kaa aashirwad diya
 According to the believers, once another story, Hanumanji got engaged in the service by taking the form of a Brahmin child in the service of the Brahmins who were sacrificing in the Chandi text of Ravana
 ni:swaarth seva dekhakarbrahmanon ne hanumanji se var maangane ko kaha
 On this, Hanumanji said politely - Lord, if you are happy, then change one letter of the mantra with which i am sacrificing
 brahman is rahasy ko samaj nahin sake or tathastu kah diya
 Jayadevi in the mantra
 
 
 bhurtiharini main 'ha' ke sthaan par 'k' uccharit karen, yahi meri ichha he
 'bhurtiharini' means that the suffering of beings and 'karini' means the suffering of beings, which caused the Goddess to be angry and got Ravana destroyed
 hanumanji ne shloke main 'ha' kii jagah 'k' karwaakar ravan ke yajna kii disha hi badal di
 What says that according to another legend related to the third Kathanavratri festival, Goddess Durga killed a buffalo Asura, that is, Mahishasura
 puranic kathaon ke anusaar mahisasur ke ekagra dhyaan se baadhya hokar devataaon ne use ajey hone kaa vardaan de diya
 After granting him a boon, the gods were worried that he would now misuse his power and as a result, Mahishasura expanded hell to the gate of heaven, and seeing this act, the gods came into a state of astonishment
 mahisasur ne surya, indra, agni, vaayu, chandramaa, yama, varun or anya devataaon ke sabhi adhikaar chin liye hai or swayan swarglok kaa maalik ban baitha
 Due to the wrath of the gods Komahisasura, the earth has to move
 tab mahisasur ke is dussahas se krodhit hokar devataaon kaa naash karne ke liye sabhi devataaon ne devi durga kii rachana kii
 It is believed that a similar force of all the gods was employed in the construction of Goddess Durga
 mahisasur kaa naash karne ke liye sabhi devataaon ne apane-apane astr devi durga ko die the or kaha jaataa he ki in devataaon ke sammilit prayaas se devi durga or balavaan ho gai thim
 These 9 days saw the goddess-mahishasura Sangram and finally she was called Mahishasuramardini

 saal 2015 main film 'bombai velvet' kii ek pramoshnal activity ke dauranvikas bahaladwara ek ladki se kii gai chhedchhad kaa maamla tool pakad gaya he
 The matter has again become hot after Anurag Kashyap's statement to the Huffington Post on the matter

 "motwani ke mutabik anuraag ne unhen kuch vakt baad bataaya ki ladki maamle ko nipataane kii baat par sahamat nahin he

 dilli kii ek khabar ne har ek ko sann karke rakh diya he
 There is only one thing in everyone's mind that how can a daughter kill her father with this ruthlessness? How can a daughter rip off her father's chest after murder to rip off his father's chest and remove the pacemaker in his heart? But now the truth that is coming out after this sensational murder is even more shocking
 katl kii naa maaloom kitni vaaradaaten hui hongi
 No one knows how many relationships have been murdered
 magar is ek katl ne is katl kii kahani sunne vaale har shaks ko jhakzor kar rakh diya he
 Many were shot to death by throwing a dagger in their chest
 magar yahaan ek beti baap ke seene main pehle khanjar utaarti he, phir seenaa chaak karti he
 After this, the pace maker inside the chest throws the heart out, so that even if the father survives the dagger, there is no scope to survive
 dilli ke khyala ilaake main police ne jab 56 saal ke dalajit ke qatl kii mistry ko suljhaayaa to uske hosh hi ud gaye
 Actually this murder was not done by anyone else, but the younger daughter of the house
 apane hi haathon apane pita kii qatl karne kii saazish main uskaa saath uske do doston ne diya tha
 The police investigation revealed that Kulwinder, along with two of his friends, had murdered his father and that he created a murder plot by watching a crime show
 bakaul police apane pita ke saath rajouri garden ilaake main akeli rahati thi
 Her elder sister is married, while the mother died three years ago
 maa kii maut ke baad wo ghar main akeli rah gai thi
 His father took advantage of this loneliness
 kulwinder ke mutabik, uskaa pita uskaa yon shoshan karne laga, jisaki vajah se wo behad pareshaan thi
 He told this to his friends
 kulwinder kaa ek dost prince sandhu tatu banane kaa kaam karata tha, jabaki uskaa doosraa dost ashok rajouri garden ilaake ke hi ek mal main kaam karata tha
 The three together conspired to murder
 sajeesh ke tahat 29 april kii raat ko kulwinder kaa ishaara milte hi donon ladke uske ghar pahunch gaye
 After this, the three together beat Kulwinder's father by beating him with a cricket wicket
 phir tasalli karne ke liye ki baap sachmuch mar chukaa he, kulwinder ne dhardaar hathiyaar se apane pita ke seene par kai waar kiye or seene main laga pesamekar baahar nikaal diya
 The three have also confessed to their crime in the police investigation
 lekin qaatilon ke ikbaal-e-jurm ke baad ek sawaal khadaa hota he ki kulajit singh ke qatl kii jo kahani kulwinder or uske doston ne bataai he, kya wo sach he yaa phir iske peeche kii kahani kuch or he
 We are not saying this
 darasal ye baat makatool kii badi beti or kulavidanr kii badi bahan kah rahi he
 According to him, his father cannot do such a disgusting act and his sister is lying
 uske mutabik pita maheenon ghar se baahar rahaa karte the
 Now the question arises that if what Amarjeet says is true then why did Kulwinder tell a lie about his father to the police? Second question, after being caught, did Kulwinder and his two friends create a sexual abuse story to escape punishment? Third question, if Daljit Singh was sexually abusing Kulwinder then why did he not tell this to his elder sister? Fourth question, if Kulwinder's accusation is true and for some reason she could not talk about sexual abuse to her sister, then why did she not take the help of the police in this matter? The fifth question is why did Kulwinder try to mislead the police at every step during the investigation or there was nothing that Daljit Singh used to stop Kulwinder and Kulwinder did not like his father to do so Was and because of this, he along with his two friends killed his father? Even if the police claim to solve the case, dekhne main ye maamla jitna aasaan dikhataa he, asaliyat main ye utana tha nahin
 From the very beginning, the murderers tried their best to confuse and mislead the police
 lekin wo ye bhul gaye ki qaatil kitna bhi chaalaak kyon naa ho wo ek galati kar baithta he jo use kaanoon kii giraft main pahunchaa detii he
 In this case too, the killers went on making mistakes step by step and finally got caught in their own woven net
 tarikh: 30 april 2014, din: buudhvaar, vaqt: subah ke 6
 35 hrs
 dilli ke khyala police stesan main ek kol aati he
 The call was from the police control room headquarters
 kol risive karanevaala ek consteble foran thana incharge ko bataata he ki ilaake main ek bujurg kii laash mili he lekin uski pahchaan nahin ho paa rahi he
 The case was of murder
 lihaaza thane se ek police team foran mauka-e-vaardaat kii taraf ravaanaa ho jaati he
 Forensic teams are also called on the spot
 police laash ke kapadon kii talaashi leti he
 But his hands feel nothing
 iske alaava police ko naa to makatool kaa mobile miltaa he, naa hi purse yaa phir koi or aisa kaagazat, jisase kii uski pahchaan ho paati
 At first glance, the police find this case a murder for robbery
 maamla sangeen tha
 And the police investigation was based on the identity of the corpse, that is why the police got Maktool's face photographed in every police station in the area
 do din biit jane ke baad khyala police stesan main rajouri garden thane se phone aata he or unhen bataaya jaataa he ki marane vaale kii pahchaan ho gai he
 a team of Khyala police reaches the Rajouri Garden police station
 wo vahaan thane main maujuud do roti hui bahanon bataati hai ki ye unke pita dalajit kii tasviir he or wo 29 april se laapata he
 Both sisters came to the police station to give information about their disappearance
 darasal ye donon bahane amarjit or kulwinder hi thim
 Police find out that Daljit was a driver by profession and lived with his younger daughter Kulwind
 kulwinder ne hi ne police ko bataaya ki uske pita ko 29 taarikh kii subah 5
 At 00, someone got a call after which he left the house
 usee ne police ko ye bhi bataaya ki dalajit kaam ke silsile main aksar hafton tak ghar se baahar rahete the
 The police pursue their investigation based on the statements of both sisters
 lekin apni jaanch ke dauraan use ye pataa chalata he ki makatool kaa qatl raat 3:30 baje se 4 baje ke bich hua he
 But when the police get out the call details of Daljit, he comes to know that Maktool did not get any call at 5 in the morning
 alabatta dalajit kaa phone to subah 4 baje ke baad se hi switch of ho gaya tha
 Not only this, during the investigation, the owner of Daljit told the police that Daljit was not to go anywhere that day
 is baat par police kaa maathaa thanka ki aakhir kulwinder jhooth kyon bol rahi he
 Just after the police got out the call details of Kulwind, the numbers of his two friends came, with whom he was talking daily
 itnaa hi nahin jab police ne kulwinder or uske doston ke mobile numberon kii lokation masping karwaai to uske saamne kai chaunkaane vaale khulaase hue
 For example, on the night of 29 April, Kulwinder and his two friends - Prince and Ashok's location - appeared at Daljeet's house
 itnaa hi nahin jis jagah se dalajit singh kii laash mili thi, in teenon ke mobile lokation bhi vahaan dikhaai di
 After this, the police started questioning Kulwinder
 pehle-pahal to kulwinder ne police ko bhatakaane kii kaaphi koshish kii
 But when she strictly questioned Kulwinder, she broke down and committed Iqbal-e-crime
 lekin usne qatl kii jo kahani police ko bataai, use sunakar wo bhi chaunk gai
 The murderer was in front of the police and she was also shocked to hear the story she told the police
 lekin ab use ye pataa lagaana he ki qaatil ne qatl kii jo vajah use bataai he, wo sach he yaa phir is qatl ke peeche kaa makasad kuch or hi he
 Kulwinder told the police that she lived alone with her father in the Rajouri Garden house
 uski badi bahan kii shaadi ho chuki thi or teen saal pehle uski maa kii maut ho gai thi
 Kulwinder told the police that her father started sexually abusing her, due to which she used to be very upset
 jab ek din uske sabar kaa baandh tut gaya, to usne apni kahani apane do doston- prince or ashok ko bataai
 After this, the three together made a plan for the murder of Daljit and started waiting for the right time to take their chance
 kulwinder or uske dost dalajit ke qatl ke liye sahi maukey kaa intjaar kar rahe the or unhen ye mauka mila 29 april kii raat 3
 00 o'clock
 kulwinder kaa ishaara milte hi prince or ashok ghar ke andar pahunch gaye
 The trio attacked Daljit nearly twenty times with a kick of a crate as he entered the house
 isi dauraan unase paas main rakhe tivi ke stand kaa sheesha bhi tut gaya
 Kulwinder knew that his father had a pacemaker in his chest and that is why Kulwinder used his broken glass to weaponize his father's death, very brutally cutting his father's chest and pulling out the pacemaker in his heart
 took
 teenon kaa plan kaamyaab ho chukaa tha
 Now it was the turn to eradicate the crime
 police ko un par shaq naa ho isliye unhone dalajit kii laash ko gaadi main rakhaa or khyala ilaake ke ek naale ke paas le jaakar phenk diya
 Maktool's pacemaker was thrown near Tagore Garden with the intention of misleading the police
 police ne aropiyon ke paas se hatya main istemaal kiye gaye hathiyaar ke alaava aropiyon ke khun se sane kapade or wo bhi gaadi bhi baraamad kar lee he, jiskaa istemaal unhone shav ko thikaane lagane ke liye kiya tha
 But the biggest question in relationship slaughter is whether Daljit really used to sexually abuse his daughter, due to which Kulwinder murdered his father or is she lying to escape after being caught? It has become clear in the police investigation that Kulwinder and his friends have done the murder together, but what is the real motive behind the murder, it has not been clear

 " When the groom arrived in Uttar Pradesh (UP) late in his marriage, the married bride refused to marry
 times of india kii report ke mutabik, yah ghatana pichley hafte bijanour ke nangaljet gaanv main hui thi
 The bride refused to accompany her groom and instead married a local man on Saturday
 report ke anusaar, is jode ne oktober main ek samuhik vivaah kaarykram main shaadi kar lee thi or 4 disambar ko ek "uchit" samaaroh main phir se shaadi karne ke liye taiyaar the
 From Dhampur city, the groom was about to reach the bride's village with his procession for the ceremony at 2 pm
 lekin wo der raat dulhan ke ghar pahunchaa
 There was a dispute between the two families over dowry
 jisase dulhan or unke rishtedaar pareshaan ho gaye
 The bride's family kept the groom and his family locked in the house
 unke keemtee saamaan chin liye or unki pitayee kii
 According to Aaj Tak, the police had to intervene to save the marriage
 haldaur stesan house officer kanta prasad ne times of india se kaha, "donon pariwaron ne police se sampark kiya he
 "" They reached an agreement
 lekin dulhan duulhe ke saath nahin janaa chaahati thi
 There was no written complaint from either side
 "shanivaar ko jab donon kaa talaak hua to maamla sulajh gaya
 The groom returned with his relatives and the bride married a person from the village in the presence of the village elders

 Police said that no one is living in the house at the moment
 silsilewar hatyaein disambar 2006 main tab prakaash main ai thim, jab pandher ke makaan ke peeche sthit naale se maanav kankal baraamad kiye gaye the

 team india ke vanade or tii20 captain mahendra singh dhoni kii aguwai main bharat shanivaar or ravivaar ko florida ke loderhil main world champion westeindies ke khilaaf do tii20 maichon kii siries khilne ja rahaa he
 Not only is it a competition between two big teams, but its outcome can also determine the direction of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the successful captain of the Indian team
 aankade gavaah hai ki mahendra singh dhoni vanade, tii20 or test cricket main bharat ke sabase safal captain rahe hai
 There is no doubt about the skill of his captaincy to any knowledgeable person of cricket
 lekin pichley kuch dinon se kai purv cricketron or cricket ke jaankaron ne viraat kohli ko hi sabhi formet kii captaini dene kii maang uthaa rakhi he
 In such a situation, the defeat in this series can be overshadowed by his captaincy
 westeindies kaa palada halkaa bariwesteindies ke khilaaf team india antarrashtriya tii20 cricket main 2-3 se peeche he
 There have been five matches between the two teams so far of which Team India has won only two matches
 nishchit hi yah antar bahut bada nahin he jisase daraa ja sake lekin isi saal world tii20 ke semifinal main mili haar kii tis ab tak salti rahi he
 In such a situation, it becomes very important for Team India to win in both the matches
 
 
 
 But it is not easy to win, so this year India has played 19 T20 matches so far, out of which it has won 15
 tii20 cricket main australia, srilanka jaisi tiimon ko haraaya, asia cap toornament apane naam kiya or world tii20 ke semifinal main pahunchaa
 That is, India has done well in terms of statistics
 saath hi jis derren saimi kii captaini main westeindies ne world tii20 kaa taj jeeta tha use westeindies board ne hataakar final main lagaataar chaar chakke jadne vaale carlos brathwet ko team kii bagdor saunpi he or yahaan pehali baar unke netritv main team khilne utregi
 Dhoni himself has always been praised by the veterans for his captaincy and having an inexperienced captaincy in front of him makes him curse many before the series starts
 lihaaja bhartiya team ko haraana bhi world champion ke liye aasaan nahin hoga
 The Gayle vs Kohli match will certainly be the absence of Darren Sammy, who has given two World T20s to the West Indies team, but the presence of explosive cricketers like Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels, Kieron Pollard, Dwayne Bravo, Lendl Simmons will surely make the World Champion team's performance
 Will not let it fade
 bhartiya team ke paas jabardast form main chal rahe viraat kohli or jasprit bumraah jaise cricketer hai to khud captain dhoni kii khyaati chote formet ke sabase bade finishr ke taur par he
 In such a situation, it would not be meaningless to assume that the competition will be a thorn
 jite to number van, haare to ludhakengetim india agar world champion ko 2-0 se haraane main kaamyaab rahi to ek baar phir isisi tii20 ranking main number van ke pojishan par pahunch jaaegi
 However, he will have to share this chair with the Kiwis here
 lekin bharat agar yah siries 0-2 se ganvaa baitha to isisi ranking main number-2 ke pojishan se bhi haath dhonaa padegaa
 At present, India is second with 128 points while World Champion West Indies is at number three with 122 points
 is list main 132 ankon ke saath top par kiwi team baithi he
 However, there will be no change in the ranking of both teams if the series remains at 1-1
 kya bolte hai captain dhoni ke record?dhoni kii captaini kaa record bolta he ki wo duniyabar ke tamaam captainon se kahin adhik tii20 antarrashtriya cricket maichon main team kii captaini kar chuke hai
 While Dhoni has led the team in 70 matches, Porterfield (48) of Ireland and World Cup winner Darren Sammy (47) of West Indies are standing at number two and three respectively
 saath hi 35 se adhik tii20 antarrashtriya maichon main team kii bagdor sanbhaalane waalon main dhoni sabase safal captain rahe hai
 He has won India in 42 matches
 yani 60 fisadi match jeetne vaale dhoni ke record ko tii20 jaisi pratispardhaa main bahut acha kaha jayega kyonki yahaan choti timen bhi bade bado ke chakke chhudaa detii hai
 Now the question arises that if the team loses 0-2 after all this, will Dhoni's captaincy fall? Cricket's rulers want Virat to take over the reins of all formats of the team, but at the same time many veterans also believe that Dhoni himself should reach the decision when he will retire
 dhoni bhi bakhubi ise samajhate hai or westeindies se haarane kii surat main wo oktober main newjiland ke khilaaf hone vaale paanch vanade maichon kii siries main aakhri baar team india kii captaini sambhalate dikhen to hairaani nahin hogi

 The Congress and the BSP may enter the fray in three state assembly elections to be held this year
 donon dalon ke bich siton ke bantwaare par manthan jari he
 But if this coalition had been held in the last election ie 2013, the political equations of these states would have been completely different
 chhattisgarh main to bijepi kii sarkaar kii vaapasi hi khatai main pad jaati jabaki madhya pradesh vidhansabha main bhi congress-basapa gathbandhan bijepi kii 41 siten kam kar detaa
 Let us know that assembly elections are to be held in october-november of this year in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 in teenon rajyon main bijepi kii sarkarein hai
 MP and BJP have been in power in Chhattisgarh for 15 years
 empi pradesh adhyaksh kamalnath basapa ke saath gathbandhan ke liye mayawati ke saath baatcheet kar rahe hai
 According to sources, the alliance between the two parties in the state is almost certain
 2013 main madhyapradesh main bispi ne 230 siton main se 227 siton par apane ummidavaar utaare the
 BSP 6 here
 42 fisadi vot ke saath chaar siten jeetne main safal rahi thi
 While 8 between BJP and Congress
 4 fisadi vot share kaa antar tha
 BJP had 165 seats and Congress 58 seats
 rajya main agar congress bijepi milakar chunavi samar main utarate to nateeja alag hota
 If combined with the votes of both the parties, the bsp-congress would have 103 seats
 is tarah se 41 siton kaa phayda hota
 Whereas BJP remains the largest party with 124 seats
 chhattisgarh main agar basapa-congress ek saath hote to rajya kii raajnneetik tasviir alag hoti
 In the 2013 elections, BJP won 49 seats out of the 90 assembly seats in the state
 jabaki congress ko 39 or basapa ko 1 seat mili thi
 The results would have been different had the two parties come together in an election summer
 bijepi ko 11 siton kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padataa or 38 siten milteen
 Whereas the congress-bsp alliance would have come to power with 51 seats
 rajasthan main 200 vidhansabha siten hai
 The BJP returned to power in the 2013 election with a thumping majority of 163 seats
 congress ko 21 or basapa ko 3 siten mili thim, jabaki 13 siten nirdaleey ko mili thim
 In the 2013 elections in Rajasthan, the congress-bsp alliance would have lost 9 seats to the BJP
 jabaki gathbandhan ko 34 siton kaa phayda mil saktaa tha
 Looking at the equation of assembly elections, the strongest base of BSP is in UP
 jabaki madhya pradesh main 62 siton par uskaa prabhaav he
 In the 2013 elections, the BJP had 40 seats in the bsp-dominated area, the Congress 18 and the BSP itself four
 congress-bispi ne gathbandhan main chunaav ladaa hota to 46 siton par use jeet milti
 Whereas bjp's 24 seats would have reduced
 rajasthan ke 11 vidhansabha kshetra upi kii seemaa se sate hai
 In the 2013 elections, BJP won seven seats, Congress three and BSP one seat
 jabaki gathbandhan hone par inhen saat siton kaa phayda miltaa or bijepi ko 4 siton kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padataa

 He said that there were many deficiencies in the security of former Prime Ministers of the country, Rajiv Gandhi and Indira Gandhi, but that is no longer the era
 ab narendra modi desh ke piem hai or unki suraksha vyavastha bahut hi buland or abhedya he
 Sanjay Raut said that the opponents hatch such a conspiracy, but the matter has not been fully disclosed yet
 maharashtra ke kuch log pakade gaye hai jinke paas se letters mila he
 Pune Police is very smart to see what facts come before the court
 unhone kaha ki chaahe maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ho, pradhanmantri narendra modi hon yaa phir desh ke kisi bhi anya rajya ke sarvocch netaa, kisi kisuraksha main koi kotahinhin baratani chahie
 Nor should there be any kind of politics in this matter
 pradhanmantri, raashtrapati yaa mukhyamantri kisi kii bhi suraksha ke bare main unke bare main koi khabar aati he to sabase pehle usapar raajnneeti shuru kar di jaati he, or usamen phayda tota dekhne lagate hai jo ki galat he
 This is happening today, but people should be restrained from both sides
 unhone kaha ki is maamle main puri jaanch honi chahie, nyaayalay ke saamne kya tathy pesh kiye jate hai usase pataa chalegaa
 He said, 'today we have written in Saamna that the security of the Prime Minister is so impenetrable that even a parinda cannot reach there'
 sanjay raut ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ke bahut dushman hote hai or isi ke chalate is desh ne do bade netaaon ko kho diya lekin ab hamaari suraksha vyavastha bahut majboot he
 'not aware of the conversation between Uddhav Thackeray and Shah' On the alliance politics, Sanjay Raut says the meeting between Kishivasena chief Uddhav Thackeray and BJP president Amit Shah has taken place in closed room after many years
 vahaan koi teesraa vyakti nahin tha, rajya ke mukhyamantri fadanvis bhi baahar baithe the
 No third person knows what happened between the two, nor did they come out and tell anyone about the conversation that took place during their meeting
 jab tak donon ek saath aakar media ke saamne baat nahin karte ham log keval andaja laga sakate hai ki is meeting main kya hua hoga
 On bjp's relations with constituents, Sanjay Raut says that Shiv Sena is not only saying that BJP does not ask for NDA constituents, but Chandrababu Naidu said the same, KC Tyagi has said that JDU is also saying the same thing
 The Akali Dal is also saying the same thing
 yah sirf shivasena kaa sawaal nahin he endie ke sabhi ghatak dal yahi baat ek swar main bol rahe hai

 There may be differences but issues continue to be discussed
 ayodhya par pratikul kabje kii theory hui khaarijasunni vakf board ne kiya tha daawajustise nazeer ke faisle kaa diya gaya havaldhyodhya maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan vivaadit jameen par apane daawey ke paksh main sunni central vakf board dwaara court main ye tark diya gaya tha ki pratikul kabje (adverse possession) ke siddhant ke aadhaar par is jameen par ab unka haq he
 But a special bench of five judges rejected his claim
 peeth ne kaha ki muslim paksh pratikul kabja sahi maane jane ke liye jaruri sharton ko puraa karne main naakaam rahaa
 To arrive at this conclusion, a judgment by Justice Abdul Nazir four years ago formed the basis
 karnataka hai court kaa jaj rahete hue justise nazeer ne kaha tha ki pratikul kabja kaa daawa maane jane ke liye kabja 'nirantarata ke saath' 'vaastavik' 'dikhne vaala or exclusive' hona chahie
 What is Adverse possession? First of all, we tell you what is adverse possession? Explaining this with an example, we can roughly say that a man named Mohan has his own house in Delhi
 usne is makaan ko sohan ko rahane ke liye diya he
 If Sohan stays in this house continuously for 12 years without any restriction, then after 12 years he has the right to sell this property
 agar ise lekar maamla court main jaataa he to kanoon ke mutabik iskaa malikana haq sohan ko milegaa
 It says that adverse possession means that the possession position
 ayodhya vivaad main muslim paksh ne kaha ki chunki masjid ke banane ke baad se ise dhahaaye jane tak is par unka lambey samay tak, exclusive or nirantar kabja rahaa he, is vajah se pratikul kabje kii theory ke mutabik is sampatti par unka daawa banataa he
 Read: Government moves towards building trust for construction of Ram temple
 Denying this argument, the Supreme Court bench said, "in suit 4, the plaintiff sought adverse possession in the alternative
 2015 main die gaye ek faisle main, karnataka ucch nyaayalay ke ekal nyaayadhish ke rup main ham main se ek (justise abdul nazeer) ne pratikul kabje kaa daawa maanane ke liye kuch purv nirdhaarit sharten rakhi
 "the 2015 decision by Justice Nazir was passed on a property dispute in which the legal heirs of the property owner ordered a court to quash a gift deed and prevent other parties from taking possession of the disputed property
 Was demanded
 ayodhya maamle kii sunwaayee karte hue adaalat ne 2015 main justise nazeer dwaara die gaye faisle kaa zikr kiya or kaha, 'pratikul kabje kii avadharana shatrutapurna kabje par vichaar karti he
 'the court further said,' For possession by one person to be an adverse possession, one must definitely do so in which he does not approve another's rights but denies them
 kabje kaa matlab ye hota he ki kabja karne vaale vyakti ke dimag main swaamitv or niyantran kaa bhav ho ki uskaa ek sampatti par adhikaar he or vah is adhikaar kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 "referring further to the 2015 Judgment, the Court stated, 'to prove adverse possession of the land, it is not sufficient to show that some work of possession was done
 kabja hone ke liye isamen nirantarata honi chahie, isaki jaankaree honi chahie or is had tak hona chahie ki ye maalik ke adhikaar ke vipareet he
 In other words, the capture must be real, visible, exclusive and continuous enough to qualify under the Limitation Act
 yani ki nijee sampatti kii haalat main kabja 12 saal tak or sarkari sampatti main 30 saal tak hona chahie
 In the light of this judgment, the Supreme Court concluded that it was impossible for the Muslim side to prepare a case of peaceful, open and continued occupation of the entire property
 " bataa den ki muslim pakshakaron ne sweekaar kiya he ki ayodhya main vivaadit sampatti par unke daawey ko adaalat main hinsa ke jariye kai baar chunauti di gai he

 darasal, ashanka jataai gai thi ki in acounts ke jariye videshi sansthaaen madhyavadhi chunaav ko prabhavit kar sakati hai
 Facebook wrote in a blog post that on Sunday evening, the US law enforcement agency contacted us about online activity that had recently been discovered and which they believed may be linked to foreign entities
 usne kaha ki hamane apni bahut hi shuruaati jaanch main ab tak kareeb 30 fasebuk acount or 85 instagram acount aise paae hai jo sandigdh lag rahe hai
 According to Facebook, 'we immediately blocked these accounts and are investigating them in detail

 However, it was also claimed that they have not received any indication as to how the election will be affected

 With the rising prices of petrol and diesel and falling rupee, the central government is facing difficulties on the economy front
 agast maheene ke dauraan khudara mudrasphiti 10 maheene ke nichle str par rahi
 However, there is a question on these figures that where there is a continuous weakness in the rupee against the dollar along with the ever increasing prices of petrol and diesel, in such a situation no one can stop inflation
 aise main kin kaarnon se desh menkhudra mahangaaike aankadon main giravat dekhne ko mil rahi he or is giravat kaa kya khamiyaja uthaanaa pad saktaa he?kyon ghat gai khudara mahangaai?kendriya sankhyikee karyaalay (siesao) dwaara jari aankadon ke anusaar, fal or subjiyon sahit rasoi kaa saamaan sasta hone se khudara mudrasphiti ghati he
 Consumer price index based inflation 4 a month ago in July

 It was 28 percent

 Has reached 69 percent
 kendra sarkaar kaa yah aankada jari karne vaali agency kaa daawa he ki desh main lagaataar bad rahe petrol-dijal ke daam se mahangaai aane ke khatre ko khatm karne kaa kaam desh main subjiyon, falon or dalhan kii keemton main ai giravat ne kiya he
 What will be the increase in interest rates? It is important to note that this figure of retail inflation is also much higher than Central Reserve Bank's estimate
 apni pichhali maudrik samiksha niti main arabiai ne chaalu vitt varsh kii duusari timahi ke dauraan 4

 lekin uski apeksha se kam mahangaai str darj hone ke baad ab uske saamne sabase badi chunauti oktober ke dauraan maudrik samiksha main kis aadhaar par byaaj daron main ijapha kare
 Significantly, amid the ongoing crisis on currencies globally, economic experts believe that the Reserve Bank can raise interest rates once again to keep the rupee strong

 At the same time, inflation of vegetables in the food basket is July K-2

 According to the report, however, inflation of pulses and pulses products was July K-8

 76 percent have been recorded

 Where consumers will get other products including food at cheaper rates in the market, there will be difficulties in front of farmers in the country

 At the same time, the cost of farmers in bringing their produce to the market is increasing continuously due to expensive petrol-diesel

 After all, why are our home clothes different and different from going out? Why do we dress well when we go to meet someone? Actually, when we meet someone, our personality and dressing makes the first impression
 aisa to nahin hota he ki ham kisi se milen or wo kuch hi minuton main hamaare vyavhaar or soch ko samaj le
 The first effect on any person is our personality and presentation and this applies equally to both men and women
 lekin mahilaon ke sandarbh main kiye gaye ek adhyayan se chaunkaane vaali baat saamne ai he
 According to a recent study, women who wear less clothes are considered more intelligent than women who wear more clothes
 haalanki ye nattejey puri tarah se luk-besd hai lekin ye vaaki hairat main daalane vaali baat he
 Doctor Alfredo Gatton of the University of Bedfordshire analyzed the responses of around 64 undergraduates to this study
 unhen kuch mahilaon kii tasveeron ko do sets main dikhaaya gaya
 In one photo, these women were wearing short tops, jackets and short skirts, and in the second set, they were wearing a long skirt and a top covering the body
 iske baad in chaatro se tasveeron ko vafadari, naukari, naitikta, persenality, sex ke prati rujhaan or samajhadaari jaise maanakon par rakhkar points dene ko kaha gaya
 Describing the results, Gatton says that after seeing the pictures, most people have assumed that girls wearing short dresses look more sensible
 haalanki is adhyayan ko antim satya nahin mana ja saktaa he kyonki shodh ke liye jin logon se sawaal kiye gaye ve sankhya main kaaphi kam the
 Gatton admits that girls in short dresses are still considered negative but their sexy looks are viewed with positivity

 The Delhi High Court has sent a notice to the Election Commission seeking registration of an FIR against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 darasal kejariwal ne ayog ke us aadesh ko hai court main chunauti di he, jisamen goa ke mukhya nirvachan adhikari ko kejariwal ke khilaaf FIR darj karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 It was only on the statement made by Arvind Kejriwal that he accepted the bribe from the voters during the assembly elections in Delhi and Goa, that the commission ordered the registration of FIR against Kejriwal
 gyaat ho ki kejariwal ne chunaavon ke dauraan matadaataaon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha ki bhale hi vahabijapi yaa congress se rishwat le len, lekin ve vot aam aadmi party ko hi den
 The Election Commission considered Arvind Kejriwal's speech as a violation of the rules, as well as inciting voters to take bribes
 kejariwal ne dilli hoicourt main isi aadesh ko chunauti di he, jis par hoicourt main sunwaayee karte hue chunaav ayog se jawaab maanga he
 The Election Commission has been asked to reply by January 15, 2018
 chunaav ayog kaa maananaa tha ki is tarah rishwatakhori ko badhaava dene vaale netaa ke khilaaf jan pratinidhitiv kanoon or ipisi ke tahat exiaar darj karne vaala he
 The commission told the court during the hearing that an FIR has been lodged against Arvind Kejriwal in January itself
 haalanki arvind kejariwal ke vakeelon ne bataaya ki unhen FIR se judi koi jaankaree ab tak nahin di gai he
 On the order of the court, the Election Commission has been directed to give a copy of the FIR to Arvind Kejriwal's lawyers
 haalanki janvari se ab tak FIR par kya hua he abhi saaf nahin he
 The Election Commission actually found Arvind Kerrywal's speech to voters in the first place during elections in Delhi and Goa unfairly luring voters
 uske baad hi chunaav ayog ne goa ke mukhya nirvachan adhikari ko kejariwal ke khilaaf FIR darj karne kaa nirdesh diya tha

 bengalooru ke em chinnaswami stadium main bharat or afghanistan ke bich khelaa gaya ek maatr test match kai myanon main yaadgaar rahaa
 Even though the result of the five-day Test match came out in two days and the Afghanistan team, playing their first international Test match, had to face defeat, Team India gave a moment of sadness to their face
 , But the method of removal, it will be remembered in the cricket world for centuries
 team india ke test captain ajinkya rahane ne afghanistan ke khilaaf khel bhaavana kaa bejod namoona pesh kar duniya ke saamne ek behtareen misaal kaayam kar di
 Team India member comments in photo session with Afghanistan team darasal, iklaute test match main jeet darj karne ke baad vijayi trophy ke saath vijeta team ke sadasyon kaa photo seshan hota he, aisi ravaayat rahi he
 But during this time, the view from the Indian team is very important in the cricket world
 duusare din hi test match ke nattejey aane ke baad jab vijayi trophy ke saath photo seshan kaa vakt hua to team india ne na sirf khud photo khinchaai, balki virdohi team afghanistan ke khilaadiyon ko bhi bula liya or unhen vijayi trophy ke saath photo khinchvaane kaa mauka diya
 This moment was also special because it is rarely seen that a winning team should also photograph their rival team with the winning trophy and celebrate the victory
 What a brilliant gesture from # teamindia to ask @acbofficials players to pose with them with the Trophy
 This has been more than just another test match # spiritofcricket # thehistoricfirst # indvafg @ Paytmpic

 Expressing grief over the suicide of a former soldier, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal demanded the implementation of One Rank One Pension (OROP) and appealed to the government to implement the scheme immediately
 kejariwal ne purv sainik ram kishan greval kii khudakushi ko 'behad durbhagyapurna' bataaya
 He referred to the suicide note of a 70-year-old ex-soldier, in which he has said he would commit suicide in support of the demand for implementation of the OROP scheme
 aam aadmi party (aap) netaa ne ek video sandesh main kaha ki yah dukhad he ki purv sainikon ke nirantar pradarshan ke baavjood oropi ko lagu nahin kiya gaya he
 Kejriwal said that and if this is true, then Prime Minister Narendra Modi lied to the country by claiming that OROP has been implemented
 aap netaa ne sainikon ke liye viklaangata pension kam karne ko lekar bhi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa
 The comments kejariwal ne bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) or sarkaar se yah bhi kaha ki vah sargical strix par raajnneeti band kare
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Kejriwal described the suicide of former soldier Ram Kishan Grewal as 'very unfortunate'
 unhone 70 varshiya purv sainik ke suicide note kaa ullekh kiya, jisamen unhone oropi yojana lagu kiye jane kii maang ke samarthan main aatmahatya karne kii baat kahi he
 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader said in a video message that it is sad that OROP has not been implemented despite the continuous demonstration of ex-servicemen
 kejariwal ne kaha ki or agar yah sach he to pradhanmantri narendra modi ne yah daawa karke desh se jhooth bolaa he ki oropi ko lagu kar diya gaya he
 The AAP leader also targeted the government for reducing the disability pension for soldiers
 tippaniyan Kejriwal also asked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the government to stop politics on surgical strikes
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he

 ) Director: Abbas -mastanstar Cast: Kapil Sharma, Varun Sharma, Arbaaz Khan, Simran Kaur Mundi, Elli Avram, Manjari Phadnis, Amrita Poori, Sai Lokar, Supriya Pathak Duration: 136 minutescertification: u / a Rating: 2
 5 stallbbaas-mastaan ne 'khilaadi', 'baazeegar', 'hamraaj', 'aitraaj', 'ajanabi' jaisi behtareen filmein di hai vahiin kamedi ke naam par badshaah bhi banaai thi
 But this time, these directors have jointly made a film about comedian Kapil Sharma, 'kis Kis Ko Pyaar Karoon' written by Anukalp Goswami, who still writes the script of Kapil's comedy show, Ab Kya abbas-mastan Ka Comedy with Kapil
 Will tempering work? Let's know: Kumar Shiv Ram Kishan (kapil Sharma) has 3–3 weddings in the Kahaani film and his three wives Juhi (manjari Phadnis), Simran (simran Kaur Mundi) and Anjali (sai lokar) are separated in the same building
 She lives on the floor
 tino biviyon ko yah nahin pataa ki shiv, ram or kishan 3 alag-alag log nahin balki ek hi insaan he jisaki ek garlfriend deepika (eli avraam) bhi he
 Then there are different twists and turns in the story in which every moment Kumar is supported by his friend and finally comes to a conclusion that you will have to watch the film to know
 scriptfilmaki script 90 ke dashak jaisi lagati he jisamen dimag kaa kam prayog karke aapako baar-baar hansaane kii koshish kii gai he
 At times, some of the dialogues of the film remind you of the punch of the show Comedy Nights
 bahut hi saamaanya or kaaphi kaalpanik kahani he
 An attempt has been made to make the film interesting and the installments also laugh
 script or bhi behatar likhi ja sakati thi jo ise ek kamedi sho se behatar bana sakati thi
 Acting according to the first film Sekpil Sharma's acting is kaabil-e-praise, although sometimes there was an atmosphere like 'comedy Nights', while Simran Kaur Mundi, Sai Lokar, Manjari Phadnis, Arbaaz Khan according to their respective roles
 Good job
 varuna sharma or jemi liver jab bhi screen par aate hai to hansi aa hi jaati he
 The music of the musicfilm is fine, but due to the songs you can get the time to eat popcorn outside without taking breaks at least 3-4 times unnecessarily
 gane kam hota to shaayad film kii kahani or rochak dikhti
 Weak Link The weak link of the film is its chaotic script which should have been broken
 2015 main bhi agar aapako 90 ke dashak kii tipical kahani parosi jaae to baat hajam nahin hoti
 Why see if you are crazy about the star cast of this film, then only watch this film otherwise you can wait till it comes on TV
 film ‘chennai express’ or haal hi main ‘dilavaale’ jaisi hit filmon main saath kaam karne vaale superstar shahrukh khan ne kaha he ki vah rohit shetty ke nirdesan main banane vaali agali film main kaam nahin kar rahe hai
 The filmmaker is currently planning to work on his next film and is a remake of the film 'ram Lakhan'
 tippaniyan In a conversation with reporters at the Stardust Awards ceremony here, Shah Rukh said no
 mujhe nahin lagata he ki mujhe film main liya jayega
 i wish Rohit all the best
 ‘happy new year’ ke 50 varshiya abhinayta ne bataaya ki kuch raajnneetik dalon ke virodh kaa saamana karne ke baavjood ‘dilavaale’ ko mil rahi pratikriya se vah khush hai
 Shah Rukh said that i am very happy with the response 'dilwale' is getting

 Therefore, in the meeting on 12 July, apart from the leaders of Andhra Pradesh, former in-charge of the state Ghulam Nabi Azad has also been invited
 or sansad ke monsoon satr ke pehle ummid kerani chaiye ki kuch kadam uthaaye ja sakate hai
 However, Digvijay Singh did not reveal what his opinion was about himself
 telangna se aane vaale congress ke saansadon ne bhi baithkon kaa daur shuru kar diya he
 They feel that soon the high command will take a decision in their favor
 saansad madhu yaksi gauda ne ajtak se kaha ki unako sonia gandhi par bharosa he jab wo praja kii maang kaa tark dete hue pradhanmantri kaa pad tyaag kar sakati he to wo kaise telugana kii maang karne vaale lakhon samarthakon ko naaraaz kar paayengin
 Another colleague of Madhu Punnam Prabhakar said in a threatening manner, 'if the high command does not listen to us, then do not believe, even if we become calm
 lekin telugana kii janata ab chup nahin baithegi
 Seeing the Congress high command's interest in Telangana, the leaders who have advocated for united Andhra have also started making rounds of Digvijay Singh's house
 kendriya vaanijya rajya mantri di purundeshwari ne apni isi raay ko doharaa bhi diya he
 She has also met Digvijay Singh for about half an hour on Wednesday

 pehla, konkan kshetra main nanaar rifinary pariyojna ko radd karnaa or doosraa, aadhe-aadhe kaarykaal ke liye mukhyamantri kaa pad saajha karnaa
 He said that despite the promise of BJP chief Amit Shah, it is unfair for senior BJP leaders to make a statement that the party which has won more seats in the assembly elections will decide on the chief minister's post
 darasal, bhaajapa ke varisht mantri chandrakant patil ne kaha he ki is saal hone ja rahe vidhansabha chunaav main adhik siten jeetne vaali party ko mukhyamantri kaa pad milegaa

 But for former Railway Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal, who has been a four-time MP from here, it is also unique in the sense that this time three women candidates from other parties are in the fray against him

 Despite getting a clean chit from the CBI, Bansal has not been able to get rid of the tainted image of the rail bribery scandal
 2013 ke shuru main “tabadalon ke liye paise” ke aarope lagane ke baad unka saath chhodie vaale medical specialist gurprit singh kehete hai, “yah aisi dhul nahin he jise aap ek sarkaar ke ishaare par chalane vaali jaanch agency kii madad se jhad len

 He has contested six Lok Sabha elections from here, winning four of them
 chandigarh ke gaanvon or majdoor coloniyon main unka majboot janaadhar he
 Those areas have higher turnout than the modern middle and upper middle class sectors of Chandigarh
 varsh 2009 main bijepi ke apane pratidwandvi ko bansal ne 60,000 se zyada maton se haraaya tha
 His supporters say that be it Gul Panag or Kiran Kher, this time the difference of Bansal's victory will be more than one lakh votes
 kade chunaav abhiyaan ke bich bansal aaropon kaa khandan karte hue kehete hai ki 2ji spectrum yaa koyala ghotaale ke aarope “khyaali pulaavon” par tike hai
 Apart from the tough challenges from BJP and AAP, Bansal can take satisfaction that BSP councilor and candidate Jannat where the workers of Chandigarh will not be able to cut the votes of the colonies
 chandigarh kii samasyaon se navafic jananath prachaar ke dauraan atakaey shabdon main bas “shahar main vikaas kii kami” kaa hi ullekh kar paati hai

 At such "welcome", Kiran Kher was nervous at first but soon calmed down and said that she only wanted to increase the bjp's number of mps

 But Bansal knows the city better than both his rivals, they have come to know that the root cause of the problem is the rapidly increasing number of people coming from other states
 lekin yah to aisi samasya he, jise aap samasya kah hi nahin sakate, kyonki aaj jo chandigarh vaale hai, ve bhi to kal kisi or jagah rahete the

 After a long effort, the court team returned when the lock did not open

 The complainant of the contractor, complainant Vinod Goyal, took the contract for the construction of Rajiv Bhavan, but he alleged that after the construction of this building, Delhi Congress did not pay him in full
 ab yah raashi badhkar 94 lakh rupee ho gai he
 In fact, the complainants made several rounds from the office of Delhi Pradesh to the office of the then Chief Minister Sheila Dixit for payment
 baad main thak-harkar unhone court kaa rukh kiya
 Although on this issue, the Congress says that they have paid in full, the builder is deliberately making false allegations

 In the Rajya Sabha, the speech of Finance Minister Jaitley, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Sitaram Yechury, the opposition also asked at least direct questions and the government also responded
 vitt mantri jetali ne loksabhaa main trinmul ke sogato raay kii tarah baarikiyon kaa istamaal karte hue jeenyu main barbaadi ke naaron ko lekar congress or vipaksh ko gherte rahe, khaskar congress kii seemaa ko test karte rahe ki kya wo ati vampanth ke samarthan ke had tak bhi ja sakati he
 CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said that his party has struggled with extreme left as much as no one has done
 congress kii taraf se gulam nabi azaad sawaalon ko lekar mukhar rahe
 From the Vemula case to the violence of the lawyers, questioned the delay in the action against them and compensated for Jyotiraditya Scindia's weak speech
 jetali ne rajyasabha main bharat kii barbaadi ke naaron ko apane tarkon ke centre main rakhaa
 It is said that opposition cannot be saved only by condemning or distancing these statements

 The opposition missed asking how the BJP differentiated between the PDP supporting Afzal and the few boys shouting slogans in JNU
 afzal ko lekar itani bahes hui lekin pidipi chupchaap rah gai
 Is this not an indication in itself that the pdp's opinion may have changed now? yechuri ne jeenyu main police ection ko lekar sawaal kiye to jetali ne kaha ki bharat ko todane ke naare lagenge to police kya dekhati rahegi
 Is this the complete answer, did the Opposition turn back
 jab umr khalid laut kar aayaa to police kyon intazaar karti rahi
 Yechury read a New York Times editorial saying that violent confrontations are taking place in India
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or unke raajnneetik sahyogi asahmatiyon ko kuchal rahe hai
 Advocates and supporters of BJP are raising slogans of Bharat Mata and anti-nationals Quit India
 patrakaron or chaatro par hamalaa ho rahaa he
 By the way, if Yechury used to quote Indian newspapers and channels, it would be known who is silent, who is confused and who is vocal, who is in full support
 daawa to nahin kar saktaa par suna he ki jab pradhanmantri america daure par gaye the to vahaan ke bade akhbaaron ne pehle panne par jagah bhi nahin di
 At the same time, when Obama ji comes to India, leave the first page, then the leader journalists all become Obama
 lekin jab ham unki tarif par chahakate hai to aalochana par kyon na sehamein
 Sitaram Yechury's speech was helping to understand nationalism, pluralism, constitutionalism, but Jaitley and BJP leaders were not interested in it
 wo lacture sunne nahin aae the, poochne aae the ki bharat kii barbaadi ke naare kyon lage
 But it was not known who were the people who raised the slogans
 jeenyu ke the yaa baahar ke yaa wo jo pakade gaye wo naare laga rahe the
 There was no response from the government on this
 smriti irani ke bhaashan kii khub charchaa ho rahi he
 Aggression and sentimentality is the surest weapon of any politician and is used by all
 par kya smriti apni lalkaar or hunkaar main kendriya mantri hone kii garima se aage nikal gayi yaa unhone bhaashan kala kaa ek nayaa mukaam kaayam kiya he
 Does the power of power in his sense also indicate that everything he says is true
 gussa or krodh main fark hota he
 Rohit kept calling him a child even though he was a 28-year-old youth
 phir bhi jis bachche kii maut par aahat wo garaz rahi thim thik usee samay ke aas paas rohit kii yaad main candal march nikaalane vaale kuch samarthakon or rohit kii maa ko dilli police ne thane main bitha liya tha
 If Smriti Irani was talking about her right to be a mother, was her right greater than Rohit's mother whose son's death was being debated in the Lok Sabha
 mayawati ko beshak lalakaara ja saktaa he magar neeche ungali dikhaakar or sar kataane kii baat kya ati naatakeey nahin he
 If something goes wrong, the leader will cut his head
 yah sab sawaal ham tab kar rahe hai jab unka bhaashan kaaphi lokapriy hua he
 More than 1
4 million people have seen him on his Facebook and more than eight lakh on our own site
 anya jagahon par bhi behisaab suna ja rahaa he
 From the point of view of Indian speech tradition, there were all the elements to be carried away in that speech
 isse asahmat nahin hua ja saktaa lekin jo unhone kaha kya un baton se asahmat hua ja saktaa he
 While we were all swept up in memory of Smriti Irani's speech, the Kolkata-based English newspaper The Telegraph and Indian Express were examining the facts
 telegraph kaa front pej in dinon kaaphi charchaa main rahata he magar smriti irani ko antee neshnal kahana bahut logon ko pasand nahin aayaa
 There is a lot of criticism, it is also being defended
 koi ise stri virdohi bataa rahaa he to koi kah rahaa he ki anti neshnal kii tukbandi main antee neshnal likhaa gaya he
 Does Smriti Irani always see her adversaries in the frame of her acting phase and consider her inferior
 agar aisa he to yah ek kism kaa tiraskaar he or ho saktaa he ki irani kaa aakrosh iskaa pratikaar bhi ho
 But could it also be that Smriti Irani feels like this unnecessarily and she gets swept away in retaliation under the pretext of it
 loksabhaa main smriti irani ne telugana police kaa bayaan padhaa ki jab wo uniwarsity gai to cameraa khulaa paaya, parthiv sharir utaar kar bistar par rakhaa hua tha
 There was a hand-written suicide note in which no one was accused
 phir kesiar kii party ke saansad se bahes hoti he or ve aage kahati hai ki kisi ne bachche ke kareeb doctor ko nahin jane diya
 Police report that there was no attempt to revive or save the child
 use doctor tak le jane kaa ek bhi prayaas nahin hua
 Police was not allowed to reach there until half past six in the morning
 uske shav ko raajnneetik hathiyaar ke rup main istemaal kiya gaya
 The Telangana Police is saying all this
 tippaniyan The Prime Minister has tweeted Smriti's speech and has written that Satyamev Jayate
 par jab hamaari sahyogi uma sudhir ne us doctor se baat kii to ek or satya saamne aa gaya lekin is bhaashan ke baad rohit vemula ke dost zilarullah nisha ne ek video diya he
 In this video you can see that there are doctors along with the police at the scene
 daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki pataa chalate hi police or doctor ko bulaayaa gaya or kamare main rohit ke shav ko donon kii maujuudagi main pankhe se utaar kar bistar par rakhaa gaya
 Our colleague Uma Sudhir said that it is true that the body of Vemula was removed at 6
30 am
 telugana police bhi apni report main yahi kahati he ki police kamare main chali to gai thi magar shav ko agali subah tak hataane nahin diya gaya
 But Smriti Irani said that no doctor was allowed to see her
 kisi ne bachche ke rivive yani bachaane kaa prayaas nahin kiya
 Whereas Dr
 Rajshree told Uma Sudhir that she is the Chief Medical Officer of Hyderabad Central University
 unhen jaise hi bulaayaa gaya ve chaar minute main pahunch gayi
 The dead body was lowered in front of them and when checked, there was no beating left
 unhone ne hi 17 janvari ko saadhe saat baje rohit vemula ko mrit ghoshit kiya tha
 He could not be saved
 doctor rajshri ne enditivi kii samvaadadaata uma sudhir se kaha ki unhone police ko bhi yahi bayaan diya tha or visi ko bhi yahi kaha tha par pataa nahin police kii report main yah sab kyon nahin he
 The Telangana Police is no longer speaking
 police kaa bayaan zaruri he kyonki kendriya mantri ne police kii report ke aadhaar par hi kaha
 Now that his point is being challenged, how can it be assumed that what the Union Minister was saying in the House was the fact or there were the final facts
 kendriya mantri irani ne rajyasabha main bhi jawaab diya magar loksabhaa kii tarah aakraamak nahin thi
 In the Lok Sabha said that there should not be politics, in the Rajya Sabha she started reading Rohit's Facebook post in which he criticized Marxism
 darasal ambedkar forum to bispi kii bhi aalochana karata he kya iske sahare uski maut kii paristhitiyaan banane main prashasnic chook kii koi bhoomika he yaa nahin is par kuch saaf nahin hua
 It may be from the investigation that is going on
 rajyasabha main smriti irani jab jawaab de rahi thi tab kaaphi nonkajhonk hui
 Sitaram Yechury also said that if the minister seems to be scolding, the minister denied
 kaaphi nonkajhonk ke baad unka jawaab puraa nahin hua he or guuruuvaar subah tak ke liye sadan sthagit ho gaya
 Ghulam Nabi Azad, from the Congress, was vocal about the questions
 vemula maamle se lekar vakeelon kii hinsa, unke khilaaf karrwai main hui deree ko lekar sawaal kiya or jyotiraditya sindhiya ke kamazor bhaashan kii bharpai kii
 Jaitley placed the slogan of India's ruin in the Rajya Sabha at the center of his arguments
 kaha ki in bayanon kii ninda yaa duuri bana lene se hi vipaksh batch nahin saktaa
 Jaitley made it clear about the PDP that compromising with the mainstream party of Kashmir is a compulsion of any national party and is in the national interest, there is no need to be embarrassed about it
 vipaksh poochne se chook gaya ki bijepi afzal kaa samarthan karne vaali pidipi or jeenyu main naare lagane vaale kuch ladakon main kaise fark karti he
 There was so much debate about Afzal but the PDP remained silent
 kya ye apane aap main sanket nahin he ki pidipi kii raay ab badal gai hogi
 When Yechury questioned the police action in JNU, Jaitley said if the slogans of breaking India were raised then what would the police keep watching
 kya ye puraa jawaab he, kya vipaksh ne palatakar poocha
 Why did the police wait when Omar Khalid returned? yechuri ne neuyork times ke sampadakeey ko padhakar sunaaya jisamen kaha gaya he ki bharat main hinsak takaraav ho rahe hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his political allies are crushing disagreements
 vakil or bijepi samarthak bharat mata or deshadrohi bharat chodo ke naare laga rahe hai
 Journalists and students are under attack
 vaise yechuri bhartiya akhabaaron or channelon ko kot karte to pataa chalata ki koun chup he, koun uljhan main hai or koun mukhar, koun sampurna samarthan main he
 Can not claim but heard that when the Prime Minister went to visit America, the big newspapers there did not even give a place on the front page
 vahiin jab obama ji bharat aate hai to pehla panna to chhodiye netaa patrkaar sab obama ban jate hai
 But when we tweet on his praise, why not bear the criticism
 seetaram yechuri kaa bhaashan rashtrawaad, bahultawad, samvidhanwaad ko samajhane main madad to kar rahaa tha lekin jetali or bijepi ke netaaon kii isamen dilchaspee nahin thi
 He did not come to listen to the lecture, to ask why the slogans of India's ruin were raised
 par yah nahin pataa chalaa ki naare lagane vaale koun log the
 Those who were from JNU or outside or those who were caught were raising slogans
 is par sarkaar kii taraf se koi jawaab nahin aayaa
 Smriti Irani's speech is being discussed a lot
 aakraamakata or bhavukta kisi bhi rajaneta kaa achook hathiyaar he or iskaa istemaal sab karte hai
 But whether Smriti has gone beyond her dignity and dignity to be a Union Minister or she has established a new place in the art of speech
 kya unke bhav main satta kaa gurur bhi jhalka ki unki har baat hi satya he tathy he
 There is a difference between anger and anger
 rohit ko child kahati raheen jabaki wo 28 saal kaa noujvaan tha
 However, around the same time, the child whose death she was hurting, some supporters who took out a candle march in Rohit's memory and Rohit's mother had got the Delhi Police stationed
 agar smriti irani maa hone ke adhikaar se baat kar rahi thim to kya unka adhikaar rohit kii maa se bada tha jiske bete kii maut par loksabhaa main bahes ho rahi thi
 Mayawati can be defied, of course, but it is not very dramatic that she is pointing her finger and cutting her head
 kya baat galat nikalne par netaa sar tak kataa lenge
 We are questioning all this when his speech has become very popular
 unheen ke fasebuk par 14 lakh se adhik logon ne dekha he or hamaari apni site par aath lakh se adhik
 Abundance is being heard elsewhere
 bhartiya bhaashan panrapara ke lihaaz se us bhaashan main baha le jane ke saare tatv maujuud the
 It cannot be disagreed but can be disagreed with what he said
 jab ham sab smriti irani ke bhaashan ke ufaan main bah rahe the usee vakt kolkata kaa angreji akhbaar di telegraph or indian express tathyon kii jaanch kar rahe the
 The front page of the Telegraph is very much discussed these days, but many people did not like to call Smriti Irani an aunt national
 khub aalochana ho rahi he, bachaav bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 Some are calling it anti-women, while some are saying that Anti National has been written in the rhyme of Anti National
 kya smriti irani ko unke virdohi hameshaa unke abhinay ke daur ke frem main hi dekhte hai or kamatar samajhate hai
 If that is the case then it is a kind of reproach and maybe Iran's resentment is also a retaliation
 lekin kya yah bhi ho saktaa he ki smriti irani ko bevajaah hi aisa lagata he or ve iske bahaane pratikaar ke atirek main bah jaati hai
 In the Lok Sabha, Smriti Irani read the statement of the Telangana Police that when she went to university, the room was found open, the body was taken off the body and kept on the bed
 haath se likhaa hua suicide note tha jisamen kisi par aarope nahin tha
 Then KCR has an argument with the MP of the party and she further says that nobody has let the doctor close to the child
 police ne report kiya he ki bachche ko punerjeevit yaa bachaane kaa ek bhi prayaas nahin hua
 There was not a single attempt to take him to the doctor
 saadhe chah baje subah tak police ko vahaan pahunchane nahin diya gaya
 His body was used as a political weapon
 ye sab telugana police kah rahi he
 The comments pradhanmantri ne smriti ke bhaashan ko twit kiya he or likhaa he ki satyamev jayate
 But when our colleague Uma Sudhir spoke to that doctor, another truth came out but after this speech, Rohit Vemula's friend Zillarullah Nisha has given a video
 is video main aap dekh sakate hai ki ghatnasthal par police ke saath doctor bhi hai
 It is being claimed that the police and the doctor were called as soon as they came to know and Rohit's body was removed from the fan and placed on the bed in the presence of both
 hamaari sahyogi uma sudhir ne bataaya ki yah sahi he ki vemula ke shav ko subah saadhe chah baje hataaya gaya
 The Telangana police also say in their report that the police had gone into the room but the body was not allowed to be removed until the next morning
 lekin smriti irani ne kaha ki kisi bhi doctor ko use dekhne kii anumati nahin di gai
 No one attempted to save the child's revive
 jabaki uma sudhir se doctor rajshri ne kaha ki vah hyderabad central uniwarsity kii chif medical afasar hai
 As soon as she was called, she arrived in four minutes
 unke saamne shav ko utaara gaya or jab check kiya, koi dhadkan nahin bachi thi
 It was he who declared Rohit Vemula dead at 7:30 pm on 17 January
 use bachaaya nahin ja saktaa tha
 Dr
 Rajshree told NDTV correspondent Uma Sudhir that he had given the same statement to the police and told the same thing to the VC, but do not know why this is not there in the police report
 telugana police ab nahin bol rahi he
 The statement of the police is necessary because the Union Minister said only on the basis of the police report
 ab jab unki baat ko chunauti di ja rahi he, ye kaise maan liya jaae ki kendriya mantri sadan main jo kah rahi thim wo tathy hi the yaa vahiin antim tathy the
 Union Minister Irani also responded in the Rajya Sabha but was not as aggressive as the Lok Sabha
 loksabhaa main kaha ki raajnneeti nahin honi chahie, rajyasabha main rohit ke us fasebuk post ko padhane lageen jisamen usne marxvad kii aalochana kii thi
 In fact, Ambedkar Forum also criticizes the BSP, whether administrative lapses have any role in creating the circumstances of his death with the help of it or not
 ho saktaa he jo jaanch chal rahi he, usase ho
 When Smriti Irani was replying in Rajya Sabha, there was a lot of fuss
 seetaram yechuri ne kaha bhi ki mantri daantati hui lag rahi hai to mantri ne khandan kiya
 After a lot of fuss, his reply is not complete and the House adjourned till Thursday morning
 vaise yechuri bhartiya akhabaaron or channelon ko kot karte to pataa chalata ki koun chup he, koun uljhan main hai or koun mukhar, koun sampurna samarthan main he

 rajyasabha main smriti irani jab jawaab de rahi thi tab kaaphi nonkajhonk hui
 Sitaram Yechury also said that if the minister seems to be scolding, the minister denied
 kaaphi nonkajhonk ke baad unka jawaab puraa nahin hua he or guuruuvaar subah tak ke liye sadan sthagit ho gaya
 The Prime Minister has tweeted Smriti's speech and has written that Satyamev Jayate
 par jab hamaari sahyogi uma sudhir ne us doctor se baat kii to ek or satya saamne aa gaya lekin is bhaashan ke baad rohit vemula ke dost zilarullah nisha ne ek video diya he
 In this video you can see that there are doctors along with the police at the scene
 daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki pataa chalate hi police or doctor ko bulaayaa gaya or kamare main rohit ke shav ko donon kii maujuudagi main pankhe se utaar kar bistar par rakhaa gaya
 Our colleague Uma Sudhir said that it is true that the body of Vemula was removed at 6
30 am
 telugana police bhi apni report main yahi kahati he ki police kamare main chali to gai thi magar shav ko agali subah tak hataane nahin diya gaya
 But Smriti Irani said that no doctor was allowed to see her
 kisi ne bachche ke rivive yani bachaane kaa prayaas nahin kiya
 Whereas Dr
 Rajshree told Uma Sudhir that she is the Chief Medical Officer of Hyderabad Central University
 unhen jaise hi bulaayaa gaya ve chaar minute main pahunch gayi
 The dead body was lowered in front of them and when checked, there was no beating left
 unhone ne hi 17 janvari ko saadhe saat baje rohit vemula ko mrit ghoshit kiya tha
 He could not be saved
 doctor rajshri ne enditivi kii samvaadadaata uma sudhir se kaha ki unhone police ko bhi yahi bayaan diya tha or visi ko bhi yahi kaha tha par pataa nahin police kii report main yah sab kyon nahin he
 The Telangana Police is no longer speaking
 police kaa bayaan zaruri he kyonki kendriya mantri ne police kii report ke aadhaar par hi kaha
 Now that his point is being challenged, how can it be assumed that what the Union Minister was saying in the House was the fact or there were the final facts
 kendriya mantri irani ne rajyasabha main bhi jawaab diya magar loksabhaa kii tarah aakraamak nahin thi
 In the Lok Sabha said that there should not be politics, in the Rajya Sabha she started reading Rohit's Facebook post in which he criticized Marxism

 Dr
 Rajshree told NDTV correspondent Uma Sudhir that he had given the same statement to the police and told the same thing to the VC, but do not know why this is not there in the police report
 telugana police ab nahin bol rahi he
 The statement of the police is necessary because the Union Minister said only on the basis of the police report
 ab jab unki baat ko chunauti di ja rahi he, ye kaise maan liya jaae ki kendriya mantri sadan main jo kah rahi thim wo tathy hi the yaa vahiin antim tathy the
 Union Minister Irani also responded in the Rajya Sabha but was not as aggressive as the Lok Sabha
 loksabhaa main kaha ki raajnneeti nahin honi chahie, rajyasabha main rohit ke us fasebuk post ko padhane lageen jisamen usne marxvad kii aalochana kii thi
 In fact, Ambedkar Forum also criticizes the BSP, whether administrative lapses have any role in creating the circumstances of his death with the help of it or not
 ho saktaa he jo jaanch chal rahi he, usase ho
 When Smriti Irani was replying in Rajya Sabha, there was a lot of fuss
 seetaram yechuri ne kaha bhi ki mantri daantati hui lag rahi hai to mantri ne khandan kiya
 After a lot of fuss, his reply is not complete and the House adjourned till Thursday morning

 Finance Minister's claim - RBI had no objection to electoral bonds RTI revelations had brought news that Reserve Bank had objected to it, Finance Minister said - During consultation with the government, Reserve Bank was also involved Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said That is, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had no objection to the issuance of electoral bonds by the State Bank of India
 rajyasabha main ek sawaal ke jawaab main vitt mantri ne yah daawa kiya
 The Finance Minister told the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday that while the idea of electoral bonds was being discussed, the Reserve Bank was also involved as a party during its intensive consultations with the government in several stages
 gauratlab he ki pichley mahineek artiai se yah khulaasa hua tha kiriserv bank ne elactoral bond jari karne ko lekar modi sarkaar ko chetavanee di thi
 a few days before the Modi government introduced a bill to issue electoral bonds, the Reserve Bank sent a letter and warned the government against it
 rigerv bank ne sarkaar se kaha tha ki elactoral trust ke dwaara chanda lene ke maujuuda system ko badalane kii jarurat nahin he
 Documents obtained from RTI have revealed that the Reserve Bank had warned that it could have serious consequences
 kya kaha vitt mantri nenyus agency pitiai ke mutabik vitt mantri ne kaha, 'paraamarsh prakriya ke dauraan unhone (RBI) ne yah poocha tha ki ise koun jari karegaa or iskaa prophorma kya hoga
 All these conversations have been recorded
 jab tak esbiai ne bond ko jari kiya unhone is par koi aapatti nahin kii
 The Finance Minister said that the Central Board Committee (CCB) of the Reserve Bank had indirectly agreed in its meeting on October 11, 2017, that SBI should issue electoral bonds if it is prepared for it
 
 rigerv bank ne sisibi kii baithak main or kai anya aantarik manchon par elactoral bond ke vibhinn pahaluon par baat kii thi
 The Finance Minister said, 'the CCB had supported the Reserve Bank's stand not to issue electoral bonds in scrip form and said that if the government decides that the electoral bonds will be issued by SBI in scrip form If it goes, then the Reserve Bank should support it
 'unhone kaha ki elactoral bond ko bearar rup main jari karne ke peeche mukhya vajah yah thi ki raajnneetik vyavastha main paardarshita aa sake
 He said that the Reserve Bank had suggested that electoral bonds be issued in demat format in electronic form, but this would reveal the identity of the donor and not secrecy
 iske alaava isse kam raashi ke chanda dene vaale log sahajata se nahin apana pate
 In the present system, the identity of the donor can be revealed only when there is an order from the court or any other enforcement agency to do so in a case
 kab jari hua tha elactoral bondsarkaar ne is daawey ke saath saal 2018 main is bond kii shuruyaat kii thi ki isse raajnneetik funding main paardarshita badhegi or saaf-suthra dhan aayega
 The Electoral Bonds were introduced by the Finance Act 2017
 abhi tak ke hasil aankadon ke mutabik march 2018 se oktober 2019 tak kul 12313 elactoral bond jari kiye gaye hai jinke dwaara raajnneetik dalon ko 6128 karod rupee kaa chanda mila he

 The conversation between Asaduddin Owaisi and Himanta Biswa Sarma did not stop here
 sarama ke is twit ke jawaab main ovaisi ne dobaaraa likhaa, 'bharat ko sabhi bharatiyon kii raksha kerani chahie, na ki sirf hinduon kii
