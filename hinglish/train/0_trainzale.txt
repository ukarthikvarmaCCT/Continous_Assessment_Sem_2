 sibiai saude ke is pahalu kii jaanch kar rahi he, ki chandigarh, morishas, britain tathaa tunisia kii companiyon or bichauliyon ke jariye kisi bhartiya ko lagbhag 350 karod rupee kii dallali di gai thi yaa nahin
 Manmohan Singh said, we have nothing to hide
 
 
 ham sansad main sabhi muddon kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 The comments darasal, vipaksh kaa iraadaa is saude ko lekar bhrashtachar ke maamle main sarkaar ko nishaanaa banane kaa he

 aatankwaad se judi ghatnaon ke media kawarej ke liye jald hi niyam banaae jane ke sanket dete hue kendriya soochna or prasaaran mantri arun jetali ne aaj kaha ki is mudde par sarkaar gambhirtha se vichaar kar rahi he
 While delivering the first Justice JS Verma Memorial Lecture, Jaitley also said that there has been no time for the media institutions to be banned and technology has made censorship impossible
 haalanki unhone saath hi kaha ki jis tareeke se suraksha agenciyon ke aatankwaad nirodhak abhiyaanon ko cover kiya jaataa he, vah vartmaan main media kii jimmedaari ke lihaaj se ek ahm vishay he
 Jaitley said that the question arises whether the media should be allowed to go directly to the spot or there should be some restrictions
 soochna evam prasaaran mantri ke mutabik, khufia agenciyon ne daawa kiya tha ki mumbai main 26 / 11 ke aatankwaadi hamalon ke dauraan hi unke media kawarej se hamalaavaron ke aakaaon ko madad mili or unhen is baat kii soochna milti rahi ki suraksha agenciyaan kya kar raheen hai
 Jaitley said, "our security agencies and the Ministry of Defense have a clear view that this cannot be allowed
 or isliye jis samay suraksha abhiyaan chal rahaa ho, us simit avadhi main ghatnasthal se reporting ke tareeke par bahut sakht anushaasan banaakar rakhana hoga
 'he said,' The government is considering this issue seriously and with much forward thinking
 ' He also said that in the traditional way where it is thought that a newspaper or channel can be banned, the truth is that the days of the ban are over
 ab vigyaapan dene se manaa karke media sansthaanon par dabaav bananaa bahut mushkil he
 Regarding the possibility of censorship, Jaitley said that technology has made it impossible
 unhone kaha, 'maan lijie ki aaj samvidhan ke anuchhed 352 ke tahat apatkaal laga diya jaae to bhi sensorship kaa prabhaav shunya rahegaa
 Satellites do not consider themselves geographical boundaries
 email is daayre main nahin aata

 ' The Ministry of Home Affairs had earlier asked the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to amend the rules to ban the live telecast of anti-terrorism operations by TV channels
 jetali ne ek niyam kaa bhi zikr kiya, jisamen tivi channelon ko 12 minute se adhik vigyaapan dikhaane kii anumati nahin he
 He said whether the government should tell newspapers and channels how many advertisements and how much news should be shown
 soochna prasaaran mantri ne kaha, 'kitni khabaren dikhaai jaaen or kitne vigyaapan, is baat main sarkaar kaa dakhal mere nijee vichaar se kharaab udhaaharan he
 ' ek or ahm mudde par mantri ne kaha ki media main cross-holdings yani media main nivesh karne waalon ke kai kshetron main kaarobaar ke mudde par bahes kii jarurat he
 He said that many countries have laws on this subject but not in India
 unhone kaha ki media main, nyaayik halkon main bahes kaa samay aa gaya he taaki bhartiya samaaj is vishay par ek paripakv raay bana sake
 Apart from this, Jaitley said that the media should also consider issues such as taking care of privacy while reporting on big cases and pending cases in court
 unhone kaha ki media ke saamne zyada bahari khatre nahin hai lekin uske andar hi chunautiyaan hai jo gunvattta, vishwasaneeyata or pratispardhi tathaa nishpaksh hone se judi hai
 While referring to the terrorist attack on the French magazine 'charley Abdo' in Paris recently, Jaitley said that the attack on a satirical magazine should be condemned
 agar is tarah ke hamale hote hai to abhivyakti kii aazaadee par bahut pratikul asar padegaa
 After the Pulwama terror attack, America, Britain and France have also joined India in the war against terror

 Rabri Devi also answered many questions during a conversation with 'aaj Tak'
 sawaal puche jane par ki is baar lalu parivaar satta se bedakhal ho chukaa he or unke upar sankat ke badal chaa rahe hai kyonki parivaar ke kai sadasyon ke upar bhrashtachar ke maamle chal rahe hai, rabari devi ne kaha ki jab chand or suraj main grahan lag saktaa he to vah log to aam insaan hai

 party mahasasachiv javed raja ne bataaya ki party ke rashtriya adhyaksh sharad yadav ne in donon netaaon ke nilamban ko tatkaal prabhaav se samaapt karne kaa nirnay kiya he
 He said that this decision was taken after considering the reply of show cause notice given by the party's disciplinary committee to these two leaders
 party ke is nirnay ko bihar main is saal navambar main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 Sharma comes from a high caste and is considered to have a significant influence in the Magadha and Patna divisions of the state
 party ne sharma ko tab kaaran bataao notice jari kiya jab unki patni shanti sharma up chunaav main ghosi vidhansabha kshetra se nirdaleey ummidavaar ke rup main khadi hui jabaki jadyu ne vahaan apana ummidavaar khadaa kiya tha
 Sharma was elected from this seat for more than three decades and this seat became vacant due to his winning the Lok Sabha elections
 shanti sharma haalanki yahaan se vijayi rahi
 Gopalganj MP Purnamasi Ram faced the party's displeasure when the party did not give ticket to his son Ajay Kumar, then he contested from Bagaha constituency in a by-election on RJD ticket against JDU candidate
 haalanki unhen chunaav main safalataa nahin mili
 The relatives of these two leaders did not get a party ticket for this, because Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was of the opinion that relatives of those leaders who have been elected mps should not be given party tickets in the by-election
 jaise jaise bihar chunaav kii tareekhen najadik aa rahi hai, bijepi kii ore se lagaataar is baat ko prachaarit kiya ja rahaa he ki rajya kaa aglaa siem pichhadaa yaa ati pichhadaa jati kaa hi hoga

 Senior BJP leader and former foreign minister Jaswant Singh's son Manvendra Singh may join the Congress
 maanavendra 13 oktober ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or congress mahasachiv ashok gahalot kii maujuudagi main congress kaa daaman tham sakate hai
 Please tell that Manvendra has already announced to leave the BJP
 maanavendra singh ne congress main jane kii baat to kahi he lekin dilli yaa jaipur main congress main shaamil honge is par inhone kuch nahin kaha
 Such a plan is also being made that Manvendra will join Congress along with his supporters by reaching a big rally of Rahul Gandhi
 maanavendra agar congress main shaamil hote hai to pashchimi rajasthan kii raajnneeti main bada badlaav aayega
 Rajputs have traditionally been BJP voters in this area, in which case Rajput voters can join Congress in large numbers
 yah bhi kayaas lagaaya ja rahaa he ki is baar vidhansabha chunaav main maanavendra singh kii patni chitra singh congress ke tikat par lard sakati hai
 Manvendra Singh is currently a BJP MLA from Shivmer constituency of Barmer
 unke pita jaswant singh bijepi ke sansthaapak sadasyon main se rahe hai or barmer loksabhaa seat se chunaav jitate rahe hai
 In the last Lok Sabha election, if the BJP did not give him a ticket, then he contested the independent elections and lost
 maanavendra singh ne 22 sitambar ko barmer ke pachapadara main swabhimaan raily kar bijepi chhodane kaa elaan kiya tha
 Since then, there have been speculations that Manvendra Singh may go to the Congress
 yah kaha ja rahaa he ki maanavendra singh vidhansabha chunaav nahin ladenge balki barmer se loksabhaa chunaav lard sakate hai

 bagal kii ek mej par kautilya ke arthshaastra kaa french tajurma rakhaa he
 In an exclusive interview with Group Editorial Director Raj Chengappa, Macron spoke openly and candidly on several key issues affecting India and the world, and also explained how he would like to leave a two-way relationship
 anshamraj chengappah shashan pramukh ke naate yah aapaki pehali bharat yatra hogi
 First you have been there as a banker
 is desh ke bare main aapke man par kya chhap padi?emanuel macrohrashtrapati ke naate yah meri pehali yatra he or mujhe bahut khushi he ki main aapke desh kii yatra par aa rahaa hum
 When Prime Minister Modi came to Paris in June (2017), he invited me for this
 hamaari mulaakaat shandaar rahi, shandaar or bahut dostana baatcheet hui thi or unhone mujhase kaha tha—bharat aaie
 So now i am coming
 lekin mujhe banker ke naate apni bilkul pehali yatra yaad he or main logon kii urja dekhakar, khaskar bangaluru main, bahut prabhavit hua tha or mujhe khaskar tech companiyon main kai yuva or medhaavi logon kii yaad he
 He is very, very influential and i will be accompanied (during this trip) by a lot of French ceos and French start-ups, who are working daily with Indian startups and entrepreneurs or one of their key employers
 Are in India
 to meraa matlab he ki hamaare yuva or antrapriner hamaare bich kii kadikhaan hai
 Raj Chengappa: You mentioned Prime Minister Modi and there is a difference of 27 years between the two of you
 phir bhi june 2017 main jab aap unase isi daftar main pehali baar mili the, tab aisa laga ki aap donon kii acchhee jami thi
 How is your chemistry with Modi? Macro: i understand that even if you are not of the same generation, you can still have chemistry and my personal life is probably one of the best examples of this type of chemistry
 main pradhanmantri modi ke vijan se bahut prabhavit hua tha, khaskar jalwaayu (parivartan ko ulatney) ke prati unki majboot patibaddhta se, or is agenda ke ek hisse ko ham bharat main saath milakar anjaam denge, khaskar antarrashtriya saura gathbandhan ke jariye
 But i think the chemistry is due to the fact that he is a very intelligent person and has a personal philosophy and inclination towards freedom
 or ve aapke desh kii samprabhutaa se bahut gahare jude hai, jaise main apane desh kii samprabhutaa se judaa hum
 i understand that it combines personal backgrounds of different cultures and civilizations, but there are some shared strengths and important things in terms of political philosophy — this strong commitment to sovereignty, global issues, climate and youth
 raaj chengappah france or bharat antarrashtriya saura gathbandhan (iesa) main saajheedaar hai
 But soon after President (donald) Trump took charge, he decided that the US would no longer be part of the Paris Climate Change Agreement of 2015
 haalanki us vakt aapane shandaar lafj istemaal kiya or kaha tha ki, ''aaie apane grah ko ek baar phir mahaan banaaen", par kya yah bahut gambhir jhatka nahin he?macrothmain samajhataa hum ki yah america kii sangheey sarkaar ke liye bahut gambhir jhatka he, par khud america ke liye nahin
 The private sector, to me, is deeply committed to this fight against US state climate change
 yahi vajah he ki main is saajha ladaai ko lekar or ham jo amal main laa sakate hai, usko lekar bahut ummiido se bharaa hum, kyonki main maanata hum ki kabhi na kabhi america ko is club main phir se shaamil hona hi hoga
 But immediately after President Trump's announcement, it was extremely important that the outline of the Paris Agreement be preserved
 or is sandarbh main pradhanmantri modi kii taraf se patibaddhta ke lafj mere liye bahut ahm the, jab ve pichley saal june main paris aae the
 The second thing is to carry out the work according to this agenda, as many countries have announced their support for this agenda, but they have not carried out their own action plans in their respective areas
 yahi vajah thi ki maine disambar (2017) main paris main van planet summit kaa aayojan kiya taaki in 12 patibaddhtaon ko puraa karne ke liye jameen par thos pariyojnaayen bana saken or rakam kaa intjaam kar saken
 i have closely monitored the implementation of these commitments and a part of this is the International Solar Alliance
 raaj chengappah iesa ke liye 1 kharab dollar kii rakam alag se jutaney kii apeksha kii gai he
 Will we be able to raise this amount? How will you ensure this? Macro: We will definitely get it, because many countries have promised us, and everyone is working together on the price
 aap aaj kii keemat ko dekhen, to sabsidi kii maatra main baari kami ai he taaki saura urja ke jariye pratispardhi urja mil sake
 This is a big opportunity because it is the best way to take a quantum leap in development and achieve a sustainable model of development not only for Africa but for many more areas
 bharat ke liye yah jabardast mauka he
 We will go to Benaras with Prime Minister Modi and inaugurate a big project which includes Indian and French players
 antarrashtriya saura gathbandhan ke liye ek ahm chunauti pehle rakam kaa intjaam karnaa he
 i am confident of this because many countries are with us and because we will manage together, this will happen due to our commitment to attract many investors over the long term
 duusari baat yah he ki ahm or vishwasaneey pariyojnaon kii ek fehrist hamaare paas ho
 The homework that we have done while preparing for this conference and the work that we will do after that (that is) will create a list of concrete projects to aggressively complete
 logon ko saboot chahie
 We want results
 hamen carbon dioxide kaa utsarjan kam karnaa he or hamen is saura urja pahal ke jariye is nai kism kii urja kaa, khaskar akshay urja kaa, vikaas karnaa he
 Raj Chengappa: The second part is of your important bilateral visit to India
 aapane or piem modi ne jin baton kii charchaa kii he, unamem se ek ranneetik rishton ko gaharaa karnaa bhi he
 What is the impression of Macros that you would like to leave when you land in Delhi? Macro: i want India to be an important and reliable partner in terms of security in the region so that we can achieve what i call the freedom of sovereignty
 main samajhataa hum ki hamaare saamne badi chunauti he, or vah hind mahaasaagar / prashanth mahaasaagar kshetra main aapaki samprabhutaa kii hifaazat karnaa he
 Through our geography we are part of this region
 bahut saare log ise nazarandaaj kar dete hai
 But we are not just a European force
 ham reunion dweep or prashanth ke ek dweep ke jariye hind mahaasaagar / prashanth mahaasaagar kshetra kii takaton kaa hissaa bhi hai or mere liye samuhik suraksha ke lihaaj se is bhagidaari kaa hissaa hona bahut ahm baat he
 We are the second major global force in terms of presence and impact in the ocean
 ham majboot samudri takat hai, hamaare paas dheron parmaanu pandubbiyaan se las badi nausena he
 We are very active through various missions in this area to protect this collective security
 or mere liye is samooche ilaake main sthirataa ko kaayam rakhane, kisi bhi dabadabe se bachane ke liye or apane bhagidaaron kii samprabhutaa kii aazaadee ko mahfuj rakhane ke liye bharat bharosemand saajhedaar he
 Talk about collective security and this two-way agenda, as well as anti-terrorism and all kinds of terrorism, especially cross-border terrorism, both of us have faced different forms of terrorism in the last year and our shared It is extremely important to work closely (jointly) to strengthen exchanges, links between our intelligence services so that we can protect our people
 raaj chengappah mujhe khushi he ki aapane aatankwaad kaa zikr kiya kyonki yah donon deshon ke liye gahari chintaa kii baat he
 We have both been victims of attacks
 ham koun-si saajha pahal kar sakate hai, khaskar un deshon ko lekar jo aatank kaa samarthan karte hai, masalan pakistan?macrothhamane hameshaa apni jimmedaariyon kaa nirvaah kiya he
 Even earlier when India was attacked or when it was in a difficult situation in the area, we supported it and we will continue to follow this policy
 ab hamen karnaa yah he ki suraksha, achche taur-tareekon or jaankaree kii adla-badali ke lihaaj se dotarafa sahyog ko badhanaa he
 One threat to you will be the return of the jihadis from the iraq-syria region
 hamaare mukhya saajha hiton main se ek is kshetra main sahyog he
 They attacked France many times and now they will decide to return and take refuge in your area
 khufia soochnaaon kaa aadan-pradaan karne, aantak-virdohi sahyog ko badhaane ke lihaaj se bahut thos sahyog behad jaruri or ahm he
 For me it is a strategic partnership
 agar ham ise badhanaa, nai shakl dena chaahate hai, to hamen puure ilaake, hind-prashanth mahaasaagar ke ilaake, ke baar main sochna padegaa or sochna hoga ki is samooche ilaake main santulan kaise banaae rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Raj Chengappa: There have been some negotiations between India and France to gain access to each other's naval bases, on which an agreement is also to be signed
 kya aapako lagata he ki aisa is yatra ke dauraan hoga—modi-maikron samudri samjhauta?macrochnishchit taur par
 You have different projects involving some of our companies
 magar aapako ek saajha dotarafa dhaanche kii jarurat he, sarkaar se sarkaar ke bich ek dhaancha
 Our companies will have to be a part of it, but only as a part in many parts
 maine rafel ko lekar aapke desh main chal rahi tamaam bahasein dekhi hai
 But i want your people to keep in mind that this is just a piece of a more strategic and important shared structure, and more important is how to maintain stability in the area
 kyonki ham ilaake kii do badi takate hai or hamen sthirataa or pahunch kii aazaadee ko banaae rakhana he or ilaake main kisi bhi ek ke dabadabe se bachanaa he
 And it is very important because it is part of collective stability
 main samajhataa hum ki yah bhartiya diene kaa hissaa he
 i am a great admirer of Indian culture and i have always been impressed that you, century-after-century, have been able to secure a kind of unstable stability, which i would say
 french logon ke liye ise samaj paanaa bahut mushkil he kyonki ham shastreey bageeche bahut pasand karte hai jahaan har cheez saaf-suthri kyaariyon main karine se sajaai gai hoti he
 Your culture is more made up of rotations and this unstable stability
 yah behad asardaar he, yah aapke diene or aapaki takat kaa hissaa he, (yah) vah kshamta (he) jo bheetar se lekar baahar tak hameshaa sabhi santulan kaayam rakhti he
 And i know how difficult it is sometimes in this area, because many people fear the dominance of any forces, (they) feel weak in front of the attack
 or yahi vajah he ki main chahta hum france aatankwaad ke khilaaf is ladaai main bharat kaa saajhedaar bane
 But at the same time an important thing for me is that you keep this DNA of yours, this inclination towards inclusiveness and balance
 is ilaake main aapaki moulikta ke khatir, vaishvik paryaavaran kii khatir yah behad ahm he
 There are so many risks in this world, so many uncertainties, so many big forces are trying to attack each other and break the global structure
 aapako us maansikta kii jarurat he jisamen log santulan banaae rakhane, kisi ek ke dabadabe or hinsa se bachane or samaveshi siyaasi or saanskrithik samaadhaanon par gaur karne main mubtila hote hai
 Raj Chengappa: The Rafale deal has become the subject of controversy in India
 vipakshi party congress kah rahi he ki bharat ne bahut zyada paisa de diya, ki unhone apane vakt main molbhav karke behatar sauda kiya tha
 What is the truth? Macro: i was not a part of it, but i must say that bargaining was beneficial for all of us
 bharat kii sarkaar ne bahut achche-se molbhav kiya
 He protected India's industrial interests
 utpaadan ke kaam kaa ek bada hissaa ab bharat main hoga, so aapke pradhanmantri ne udyog or shramikon ke hiton kii bahut acchhee tarah se hifaazat kii
 And from the security point of view, a great deal is in your hands, because Rafale is the best aircraft of this class and in the current environment it is the best way to be safe
 jahaan tak france kii baat he, yah bahut acha tha kyonki bharat bharat main bharpoor sambhaavna he or kyonki yah hamaare bich jo saajha sahmati hogi, uskaa ek hissaa he
 In a democracy there will always be debates between the government and the opposition
 main bharat kii gharelu siyaasi jindagi kaa hissaa nahin hum, par main samajhataa hum ki aapaki sarkaar ne apane desh ke hiton kii bahut achche-se hifaazat kii thi, mahaj aarthik or audyogic nazariye se hi nahin balki ranneetik nazariye se bhi
 Raj Chengappa: Why can't the details of the deal be disclosed and doubts cannot be dispensed with instead of letting the allegations go all the way around? Can give bharat main or france main, jab sauda behad samvedansheel he, kaarobaari vajahon se ham byore ujagar nahin kar sakate
 These commercial agreements and the interests of various companies are some of the reasons for not responding to certain technical issues
 duusare, bharat sarkaar ko kuch charchaaen yojit kerani hai or unhen vichaar karnaa hoga ki vipaksh or sansad ke saamne ve koun-se byore ujagar karnaa chahenge
 i am not one of those who interferes with these discussions and you must understand that we have to consider business sensitivity
 raaj chengappah china ne van belt van road (obioar) yojana shuru kii he or aapane dabadabe shabd kaa prayog kiya
 India has its own concerns regarding OBOR
 aapaki raay main china ko in chintaaon se mukhaatib hone or inhen dur karne ke liye kya karnaa chahie?macrohbharat ke saath baatcheet kare
 i went to China earlier this year and i think today China is a very strong force equipped with a strong strategic and global perspective
 yah sadak kabhi ekatarfa sadak nahin rahi, balki vibhinn deshon ke bich vyapaar or santulan kii sadakon main ek he
 If the OBOR initiative is to succeed, it will have to be more inclusive and balanced with all the countries in the region where it is to be expanded
 obioar ko vaishvik patibaddhtaon se mail khaanaa chahie or harith bananaa hoga
 Because one of the deepest beliefs that i spoke to was that you cannot say, after being part of the Paris Agreement, that you will open coal factories in some of the countries where this road will go
 main is baat ko samajhataa hum ki is pahal ko bharat ke nazariye se khatra kaise mana ja saktaa he
 The best answer would be to offer something different
 ferj kiijie, thik he, hamen africa tak samooche ilaake kaa vikaas karne kii darkaar he
 We need more trade, more economic integrity, more exchanges, we need to train our people better
 to ham iskaa hissaa ban sakate hai kyonki yah saajha bhalaai ke liye he, par aaie is khel main hamaari bhoomika ko lekar, samoochee yojana kaa hissaa banane ko lekar baatcheet karen
 If it is merely a plan to establish supremacy, then it will never go away
 agar aisi baat he to aapke darane kii vajah he
 But take it as a very strong geopolitical vision, still make it very evolving and match our common goals
 raaj chengappah aapaki bharat yatra ke agenda main ek baat dotarafa vyapaar ko badhanaa bhi he
 Last year, we did a business of $ 10 billion, which was considered very effective
 is yatra main kya aap lakshya tay karenge or aapaki raay main unhen hasil karne ke liye kya karne kii jarurat he?macrothham or bahut kuch kar sakate hai or main ek lakshya saamne rakhane kii koshish karuunga
 But i have three main objectives in this journey
 jalwaayu, jiske dotarafa or vaishvik donon makasad hai, suraksha or is ilaake ke liye samgr samuhik dhaancha
 In my mind too much about youth, training young women and exchanging more and more
 agar ham in chizon ke mutabik kaam karen, to mujhe yakeen he ki vyapaar badhegaa
 As a natural result of this activity i will try to set goals, but i would also like to testify to their credibility with Prime Minister Modi
 kyonki agar main lakshya tay karata hum, to main unhen puraa bhi karnaa chahta hum
 There is also a lot we can do in terms of making the right investments, trading and opening up our markets to each other
 lekin mere liye vyapaar ko badhaane kii garaj se logon kaa aadan-pradaan behad jaruri or ahm he
 Your traditional historical partner was always Britain and i want France to be the new partner, a 21st century partner to be cited
 kyonki main samajhataa hum ki bharat ko europe or kul milakar europea sangh ke saath kahin zyada kaam karnaa hoga
 For that i want France to be India's gateway to Europe
 yah ranneetik rishton kii buniyaad hogi
 i want your creativity, your youth, your entrepreneurship to be more present in France, more recognized, and i want the same thing from France
 kuch din pehle, maine fishan wyk ke liye dheron dizinron, rachanakaaron ko
 
 
 i would say that the genius of this business called the people
 unamem bahut saare bhartiya sarjak bhi maujuud the, ve behat asardaar the or ve meri is yatra kaa hissaa honge
 Raj Chengappa: i am sure you will be worried about one thing and that is the delay in projects, especially in defense projects
 kya francisi kaarobaari kaam karne ke hamaare tareeke ko lekar pareshaan hai, khaskar raksha mantralay ke?macrothmain bahut vyaavhaarik kism kaa vyakti hum
 If i have a proposal, i will take it directly to the Minister or Prime Minister
 main media ke jariye nahin jaaoongaa, kyonki kaam karne kaa yah acha tarika nahin he
 i think we can do a lot
 bahut se niyamon ko durust kar sakate hai, apane dwipaksheeya tareekon ko saral bana sakate hai, naukarshahi kii prakriya ko nunatam bana sakate hai or sambandhon kii jatilta ko kam kar sakate hai
 This can happen through people's participation
 main chahta hum ki zyada se zyada kalakaar france aaen, hamaare yahaan se zyada se zyada shef bharat jaaen or hamaari paak kala ko viksit karen
 i want corporate to come in both technical and classical industries, have their participation in small services, they design small and smart cities
 main chahta hum ki aapke diziner, lekh or shodharthi zyada sankchaya main france aaen
 i want the number of Indian students in France to double by 2020
 yah acchhee baat nahin he ki france main bhartiya chaatro kii sankhya kaaphi kam he
 You have an old relationship with Britain
 main chahta hum ki aapke yuva chaatr france aaen
 There is considerable openness in France
 yah europea union kaa hissaa he
 Your students speak English, here you will get the atmosphere of many languages
 aapke zyaadaatar chaatr dharapravaah angreji bolte hai
 In our universities and grade schools you can study through English
 yah rachanaatmakataa or udhyamita kaa shahar he
 i want Paris and France to be a new center for your students to reach Europe and even America
 main in chizon ko viksit karnaa chahta hum kyonki vyapaar badhaane kaa yah sabase acha tarika he
 Right now this trade relationship is due to the government-to-government interaction in the field of defense
 yah thik he
 But new business in the field of technical and creativity is happening due to the mutual relationship between entrepreneurs and people
 raaj chengappah aap vaaki france ke shandaar ambesader hai
 The second issue is Europe
 aapane kaha ki bregsit ke baavjood europe vaapasi kar rahaa he
 You have seen uncertain election results in Italy
 aap europe or puure union ko lekar itane ashaavadi kyon hai?macrothmain keval ashaavadi nahin hum
 i am also firm
 mere andar kuch kar dikhaane kii prabal ichha he
 Time is running and you have to work fast
 germany main haal ke chunaavon ke baad chancelar ne ek gathbandhan surakshit rakhaa he
 On the other hand, mass authoritarianism has grown rapidly in Italy
 france main logon ne iskaa thik ulataa faisla kiya he
 He has liked openness, modernity and metamorphosis in the country
 mere do uddeshy hai
 One is to change France and make it a more attractive, open and strong country
 hamane pichley saat maheenon main itane sudhaar kiye hai jitna pehle kabhi nahin hue
 It has also been effective
 logon ko iske nattejey aane vaale varshon main dekhne ko milenge
 It cannot be estimated right now because it takes time to get results
 par hamane jaruri sudhaar kar die hai
 We need a stronger and organized Europe than ever before, a Europe that protects, educates and invests more than ever before so that it can step up globally with the US, China and some natural allied countries like India
 So that i could walk in step
 agar europe ke netaa abhi turant faisla karne or raftaar badhaane kii sthiti main nahin he to ve europea yojana ko nasht kar sakate hai yaa use khatre main daal sakate hai
 i am completely focused on that and want us to be more capable than ever
 raaj chengappah vaishvikaran ko ek or maar jhelni pad rahi he, or vah he raashtrapati donald trump kaa sangrakshanvaadi kadam uthaane kaa faisla
 They are destroying the globalization effort in a way
 yah europe main aapke sapanom or yojanaon ko kis prakaar prabhavit karegaa
 Macro: i think this is a huge mistake, it is like hurting the global business environment
 dablutio ke niyamon ko taiyaar karne kii niti main america kii badi bhoomika thi, or (nae kadamon kaa) nateeja yah hoga ki avasar kam ho jaaenge or deshon ke bich vyapaar yuddh kii sthiti paidaa ho jaaegi
 So, we will try to stop it
 mujhe ummid he ki ham isamen safal honge lekin koi nahin jaanata ki kab ekatarfa aadhaar par shulk laga die jaaenge, hamen damping ke khilaaf khud kii raksha kerani hogi
 If a superpower charges without any reason unlike the global treaties, it is a big mistake
 main raashtrapati trump ko samajhane kii puri koshish karuunga—hamen nishchit rup se apane saajha vaishvik dhaanche ko bachaana hoga
 Raj Chengappa: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a great supporter of globalization
 aap unase baat karte rahe hai
 Macro: i spoke to Prime Minister Modi in June (2017)
 kuch saptaah pehle daavos main main unka bhaashan sun chukaa hum
 They have always been very clear that they fully respect our global and business rules as they see an advantage in this
 hamen dridhtaa, khulepan or spasht niyamon ke saath apane logon or apane kaarobaar kii raksha kerani hogi, na ki apane hi banaae niyamon kaa ulanghan karke
 Raj Chengappa: i want to end this with some personal questions
 
 
 aapkaa pasandida bhartiya vyanjan kya he
 Macro dish or not? Macro: i would accept Prime Minister Modi's advice, but i like tandoori chicken very much
 mujhe yahaan iskaa swaad bahut acha lagata he
 Raj Chengappa: My last question is, what are the advantages and disadvantages of being the youngest President in the history of France? Macro: As much of a benefit for me as i am
 mujhe samjhauta karne kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 The advantage is that when you are young you are brave, often courageous, and rude to people because you want to make big improvements
 yah sab karne ke liye aapke andar ek urja hoti he
 But when you are young, it is expected that you will serve people for a long time and you are not allowed to work for short hours
 phayda or nuksaan, donon kaa sambandh urja se haih jab aapako pataa hota he ki aap apane logon ke liye dashakon tak kaam karne vaale hai to yah bhaavana aapako vidhvansak banane ke liye uksaati he taaki aap desh kaa kayapalat kar saken or aise faisle lete hai jo bhale hi alpakaalik taur par jatil lagen, kyonki aap jaanate hai ki aap lambey samay tak logon kii seva karne vaale hai
 i think this is what my country needs - long term decisions
 france anokhaa desh he
 We have had many revolutions here
 ham apane uddeshyon ko hasil karne ke prati drudh hai
 We are also able to make changes very fast
 hamaara iraadaa vaishvik netaaon main se ek bananaa he taaki ham apane gahare mulyon ko aage badha saken
 This is our DNA

 ranjamaware yani phiroti vaala virus

 However, Facebook has denied this

 jaise hi yujar ise clic karenge unka system lock ho jaeg jiso waapas lene ke liye bit kwine ke jariye paise dene honge
 Measures to avoid ransomware - It would be better if you open an image file sent by an unknown user

 But if the message of ransomware is seen then it can be difficult

 umr chhipaakar sarkari naukari paane kii kai ghatnaayen saamne aati rahati hai
 One such incident came to light during the investigation in Chatra district of Jharkhand
 is ajeebogareeb maamle ko lokayukta ne pakadaa he
 When the Lokayukta office conducted a probe on the controversy over the age of the watchman Sahadev Saw, posted at Itkhori police station in Chatra, a new thing came to light
 chatra ke ayukta kii jaanch report or medical board kii dastavej kii maane to mahaj das saal kii umr main hi sahadev ne sarkari naukari le lee thi
 In such a situation, the question is arising now how to get a government job at the age of ten
 philhal sahadev chaukeedaar ke pad par karyrat hai
 The younger brother is 60 years old, the younger brother of Sahadev, Ishwar Saw, is 60 years old, while he has a sister older than God and younger than Sahadev
 is maamle main sahadev saav ke chote bhai ishwar saav ne lokayukta ke paas shikaayat darj karwaai thi
 It was said in the complaint that his father Narayan Sav, a resident of Asadhiya village of Itkhori police station, was a watchman in Itkhori police station
 unke pita ke 1 april 1967 main ritairement ke baad varsh 1968 main sahadev saav ko bataurchaukeedaar niyuctimili thi
 The birth date of his brother Sahadev Sawa was 1948 at the time of getting the job
 itakhori thane ke kagajaton main janm varsh or yogadan varsh darj he
 In such a situation, Sahadev Saw was supposed to retire in the year 2008 but he is still working
 pehali baar jab lokayukta ne maamle kii jaanch ke aadesh die to is babat medical board kaa gathan kiya gaya
 When the age was examined twice by the Medical Board, it was found out that the birth date of the watchman Sahadev Saw is 1958
 dastavej main bhi janmatithi 1958 he
 In such a situation, if the Board's report is considered correct, Sahadev Sav was only 10 years old on the date of appointment
 aisi sthiti main unki naukari kaise lag gai?
 By the way, the whole office of the Lokayukta has ordered the Deputy Commissioner of Chatra to investigate himself and send the investigation report to the Lokayukta office within three weeks

 bhartiya team is dauraan chauthi pari main 364 ran ke lakshya kaa peechha nahin kar pai thi or 315 ranon par out hokar pehla test 48 ran se ganvaa baithi thi
 Kohli said in an award function, 'I think the second innings century in the Adelaide Test (in December 2014), which we almost won the match, was very special for me according to the transition phase
 main hameshaa is match ko yaad rakhuunga
 'he said,' i immediately came to my mind that i should talk to the team
 maine chauthe din ke khel ke baad team bas main khilaadiyon se baat kii or australia ne tab apni pari ghoshit nahin kii thi
 i told them that tomorrow we will try to chase whatever goal we will give us
 ’ tab mahendra singh dhoni chotil the, unki anupasthiti main kohli ne team kii captaini kii thi

 unhone kaha, ‘kisi ne bhi aapatti nahin kii or tab maine unase kaha ki ve is vichaar ke saath apane kamare main jaaen ki ve kal lakshya kaa peechha karne utrenge

 kohli ne kaha, ‘ham paanchaven din yah sochakar krij par utre ki ham is match ko jeet sakate hai
 However, we could not achieve this goal

 In the early days of marriage, you must have heard people saying, 'the first year of marriage is very difficult
 ' kai log ise honeymoon period kehete hai to kuch ke liye ye nae saathi ke saath saamanjasy bithaane kaa samay hota he
 Let us know what kind of problems people face in the first year of marriage
 
 
 shaadi ke baad ladki jab apane pati ke ghar aati he to uske liye sabakuch nayaa hota he
 At the same time, a new member also arrives at the boy's house
 har insaan kii parvarish alag hoti he or swabhaav bhi alag hota he
 In such a situation, it takes some time to keep pace with the modalities of the new house
 shaadi ke pehle ladki or ladke ke man main tarah-tarah kii jigyaasaaen or aashaaen hoti hai
 Over time, when it comes to reality, it is understood that with marriage comes a responsibility
 shaadi ke pehle saal main aapke kai sunahare khwab tuutate hai to kai usase bhi pyaari yaaden aapke jivan kaa hissaa banati hai
 Eat this fruit if you want strength and well-being
 
 
 shaadi ke pehle saal aapaki lifestil par bahut fark padataa he
 Now your partner may have to pay damages for your carelessness
 aapaki mastamaula jeevanstyli par lagaam lag jaati he or koi bhi kaam karne se pehle aap apane saathi kii raay lene lagate hai
 Working women may face many problems after marriage
 agar aapke pati ke mata-pita chaahate hai ki aap ghar ke saare kaam bhi karen or offis bhi manage karen to aapkaa jivan bahut vyast or mushkil ho jaataa he
 To hide the bad smell, stop putting your hands on the mouth, this is an easy solution till the first year of marriage, you are judged in many ways
 aapako pati ke ghar waalon ke saamne acha bananaa padataa he to offis main ye bhi dikhaanaa padataa he ki aapaki shaadi kaa aapke kaam par koi prabhaav nahin padaa he
 Even on the slightest mistake, you can get a little commentary like 'don't feel like after marriage'
 maharashtra ke kalyaan-dombiwali nigam chunaav main raaj thakare kii maharashtra navnirmaan sena ko jahaan baari nuksaan hua he, vahiin bijepi-shivasena ko jabardast badhat hasil hui he
 Owaisi's party AIMIM also opened account in corporation election
 kolhapur main bijepi or congress ke bich kaante kii takkar he
 The results of all 122 seats of kalyan-dombivli have been revealed
 shivasena ke khate main51 siten gai hai, jabaki bijepi ne 43 siton par jeet darj kii he
 Congress has got 4 seats and NCP 2, while MNS has 9 seats
 basapa ko ek or asaduddin ovaisi kii party emm ne yahaan ek seat jiti he
 While others have 9 seats in their account
 inamen se chah bijepi samarthit bataae ja rahe hai
 If these six meet BJP then the party's figure will be 49
 kolhapur kii 81 siton main se bijepi+ ke haath 32, congress ke haath 27, ensipi ke hisse 15 or shivasena ko 4 siten mili hai
 On the other hand, BJP has suffered a major setback in Beed
 bijepi netaa pankaja gopinath munde isi ilaake se taalluk rakhti hai
 NCP has captured three of the 4 municipalities here
 gauratlab he ki 2010 ke nigam chunaav menshivsenaco 21, emenes ko 27, bijepi ko 9, congress ko 15 or ensipi ko 14 siten hasil hui thim
 Apart from this, 11 independents had won in the last election
 taaja chunavi aankadon main bijepi shivasena se bhale peeche rahi he, lekin usne meyar pad kii ladaai main baaji maar lee he
 bjp's Suman Nikam has defeated the mayor of Shiv Sena
 iske alaava, shivasena ke prema mhatre, bijepi ke shivaji shellar or bispi ke ashele manere nirvirodh chune gaye
 On Sunday, polling was held for 122 seats in kalyan-dombivli municipality and 81 seats in Kolhapur
 kalyaan emenes ke prabhutv vaala ilaaka he, lekin yahaan vah kaaphi peeche rah gai he
 Two parties
 bijepi or pidipi
 Theoretically the complete opposite
 lekin vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ne donon ko najadik laa khadaa kiya he
 This is the first time that the BJP is going to be a part of the government in Jammu and Kashmir
 lekin uski 25 siton ke mukaable pidipi 28 siten lekar driving seat par he
 There was a meeting between Prime Minister Modi and Mufti Mohammad Sayeed of PDP on Friday morning
 or kaaman minimum program par samjhauta bhi
 On which PDP-BJP government will work
 lekin kya aisa sambhav he-1
 Article 370: After the formation of BJP government at the Center, the first contravention was on Article 370
 piemo ke rajyamantri jitendra singh ne offis jwine karte hi kaha ki ye sarkaar dhara 370 hataane par vichaar karegi
 However, a few days ago the government has made it clear in Parliament that the government has no proposal to remove this clause
 kuch bhi ho, lekin kashmir ko vishesh darja dilaane vaali yah dhara bijepi or sangh ko shuru se khatkati rahi he
 Contrary to all this, PDP is considered to be the most radical party associated with Kashmiriyat
 kashmir main sarkaar banane se pehle vah likhit main spashtikaran maangati rahi he ki dhara 370 ke mudde par uskaa vichaar kya he
 2
 AFSPA :kashmir main sena ko aatankiyon par karrwai ke liye yaa auchak chaanbin kaa visheshadhikaar dene vaale kanoon AFSPA ko lekar tanaav rahaa he
 All the parties of Kashmir have been demanding to remove it according to political necessity
 neshnal conference or congress ke netaa ise lekar bayaan dete rahe hai
 PDP has been more vocal about this
 vah to is bare main pakistan se baatcheet kii bhi pakshdhar he
 Pressure will be on BJP
 jo rajya ke hindu ilaakon se chunakar ai he, jabaki army kii karrwai vahaan muslim bahul ilaakon main chalati he
 3
 sarkaar kaa swaroop:modi or mufti main abhi to muddon par baat hui he
 Or perhaps even with a stake in the government
 lekin yah spasht nahin ho paaya he ki rajya main bijepi kaa koi mukhyamantri bhi hoga
 If this happens, then how many and which departments will the BJP get in the rest of the cabinet
 kaam karne kii kitni chhot hogi
 4
 centre sarkaar par dabaav:pidipi sarkaar main aane ke baad modi sarkaar par zyada se zyada dabaav dene kii koshish karegi ki vah rajya kii jaruraton ko badhachadhakar puraa karen
 As Chief Minister, he will get all the credit, so pulling from the local leadership of BJP is also possible
 5
 Opposition pressure: The National Conference and Congress have got 15 and 12 seats respectively in the assembly
 ye 27 vidhayak chahenge ki pidipi or bijepi kii paraspar virdohi vichaardhaara ko saamne laayaa jaae
 Religion should be raised in front of both parties
 jaise hi koi army oparation yaa encounter hoga, ve pidipi kaa gheraav karenge ki AFSPA ke bare main vah pradhanmantri se kya baat karne ja rahi he
 Apart from this, the way leaders like Sakshi Maharaj create trouble for the Modi government, similarly some leaders of PDP are uninterested in making statements
 kadavaahat badhane main der nahin lagegi
 It remains to be seen how long this power happiness of both parties lasts

 It was increased from 28,000 per month for the first two years of JRF to 35,000 per month for the remaining term of tenure (SRF)
 bataa den ki vahiin scolers ko echaare 8%, 16% or 24% kii sanshodhit dar par diya jayega

 India was the fifth largest country to be targeted by cyber attack in 2015 through DNS hijack
 yah baat epa-sicyor kii threat round ap report main kahi gai he
 In 2015, most cases of hijack were reported in Italy, Poland, Egypt, Sweden and India, according to a report by Finland's online cyber security company f-secure

 raajnneeti kab koun si karavat le le, kahana mushkil he
 In the same way, when politicians remember what thing or when it becomes alien, they do not know
 kuch aisa hi haal is vakt main bihar main lalu prasad kaa he
 The RJD chief has suddenly started remembering Atal Bihari Vajpayee these days, the same Vajpayee on whom Lalu never shied away from using words
 lalu prasad kaa kahana he ki vah in dinon atal bihari vaajapeyi ko bahut 'miss' kar rahe hai
 He says, 'politics like Atal Bihari is no more today
 jab atal ji pradhanmantri the to kabhi bhi phone milakar aasaani se baat kar liya karte the or vaajapeyi sun liya karte the, lekin aaj kaa daur vaisaa nahin he
 Lalu Prasad says that LK Advani is also a clean political leader, but today he is left to suffer in the BJP
 darasal, lalu kii is 'missing'politicco samajhnaa utana bhi mushkil nahin he
 It is clear that Lalu Prasad has directly attacked Narendra Modi on the pretext of Atal and Advani
 modi khud ko atal kii raah kaa pathik bataate hai
 In such a situation, attacking Modi on the pretext of Atal becomes more effective
 jabaki narendra modi se adwani kii berukhi ab kisi se chhipi nahin he
 'ganesh' of Bihar politics has declared himself as 'ganesh' of Bihar politics
 unhone kaha, 'sabhi unki hi parikrama karte hai'
 Lalu said that the politics of Bihar will start from him and will revolve around him, the politician of Wahebihar is Ganapati
 lalu kaa yah bayaan aise samay aayaa he jab bihar mennithish or lalumen 'bada koun' par bahes shuru ho gai he
 Lalu may have told Nitish Kumar the face of the CM post, but he has not failed to show that politics will revolve around him
 lalu prasad raajnneeti main devataaon kaa ghalmail pehle bhi karte aae hai
 Just before the 2005 election, he once called Rabri Devi as Sakshat Durga

 On the other hand, about 53 institutions have been punished

 piem modi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar ke chaar saal ke ab tak ke kaarykaal main pukhta taur par koi ghotaalaa saamne nahin aayaa he, lekin tamaam study ke mutabik nichle str par dekhen to bhrashtachar yaa ghoosekhori lagaataar badi he
 That is, Modi government did not get involved in any big scam but it did not take any step to get people out of everyday corruption
 centre main to koi ghotaalaa saamne nahin aayaa, lekin empi, maharashtra or rajasthan jaise bijepi shasit rajyon main kai ghotaalon ko lekar sarkaron par gambhir aarope lage
 It was said that if PM Modi talks about governance without corruption then why strict action is not being taken on scams in the states
 pienbi jaise bank ghotaalon or vijay maalya, neerav modi, lalit modi ke videsh jane ke maamle main bhi sarkaar par jamkar hamalaa bolaa gaya

 We will not tell the country, Modi ji has done a scam
 'bijepi shasit madhya pradesh main vyaapman ghotaale kii jaanch chal rahi he or rajasthan kii vasundhara raaje sarkaar par 'lalitget' jaise aarope lage
 Congress leader P
 chidambaram ne lalit modi ke desh se baahar bhaag jane ke maamle main kendriya mantri sushamaa swaraj par bhi gambhir aarope lagaae the
 He had said, 'why did he (sushma) keep his ministry in the dark about the help he got in getting travel visas to Lalit Modi
 agar sushamaa swaraj lalit modi kii madad karnaa chaahati thi, to unhone unhen bhartiya ucchayog main aavedan karne kii salaah kyon nahin di
 Why did they feel that instead of Indian documents they should get travel documents from UK

 Everyone is still obsessed with his shehnai tune
 aaie unke janmdin par jaanate he unase judi dilachasp baaten:-1
 Bismillah Khan's childhood name was Qamruddin
 ve apane mata-pita kii duusari santaan the
 Since his elder brother's name was Shamshuddin, his grandfather Rasul Bakhsh said 'bismillah' which meant 'good start'
 aage chalakar ve 'bismilla khan' ke naam se mashhoor hue
 Since then the world has known him by the name of 'bismillah Khan'
 2
 Bismillah Khan had inherited music because his family members were adept at playing the darwari raga, who used to frequent the Bhojpur princely state of Bihar to showcase their musical skills
 3
 His father used to play shehnai in the court of Maharaja Keshav Prasad Singh of Dumraon princely state of Bihar
 4
 At the age of just 6, Bismillah Khan came to Benares with his father
 vahaan unhone apane chachaa ali baksh 'vilayati' se shehanai bajaanaa siikhaa
 His master uncle 'vilayati' worked as a clarinetist in the Vishwanath temple
 5
 For the first time at the age of 14, Bismillah Khan performed the clarinet program at the Sangeet Parishad in Allahabad
 jiske baad se vah kam samay main pehali shrenee ke shehanai vadak ke rup main nikharkar saamne aae

 The amazing thing is that after the Prime Minister's speech on 15 August every year, the clarinet of Bismillah Khan became a practice of independence festival of the country
 8
 Bismillah Khan, with his penance and prowess in the folk songs like 'gravel', 'chaiti' and 'jhula', gave a lot of respect and gave the shehnai a respectable place in classical music
 9
 His clarinet resonated in Afghanistan, Europe, Iran, Iraq, Canada, West Africa, America, Japan, Hong Kong and almost all countries around the world
 unki shehanai kii gunj se filmi duniya bhi achhuti nahi rahi
 10
 vah dilli ke india get par shehanai bajaanaa chaahate the, lekin aisa ho na sakaa

 This is a season when in the streets of the street a week in advance, the songs of freedom on loudspeakers and posts filled with heroic juice on social media fills the air of patriotism in the people

 lekin kaash, sab kuch itnaa aasaan hota
 At that time there were problems of communication, it was not so easy to convey the message, the British had a sharp eye and censorship on it
 na kuch bol sakate the, na kuch chhap sakate the
 In such a situation, the patriots resorted to freedom looms to take on the British, who kept boiling in the veins of Indians, sometimes in the form of prayer, sometimes in the form of heroic juice
 bharat ko janashrutiyon kaa desh kaha jaataa he, hamen padhane se zyada sunne main mazaa aata he or agar vah gane kii shakl main hon to baat hi kuch ore hoti he
 There were many more prayers and taunts that brought life to the freedom struggle, but the names of its creators were never revealed
 khaas baat yah thi ki in taraanon ko samaj paanaa angrejon ke liye thodaa mushkil hi tha, isliye prabhaat pheri nikaali jane lagi, jisaki gunj ke saath azaadi kii kiran footne lagi
 
 
 'arise, those who sleep, the morning is dawn, the fowls of the country are turned
 chalo moh kii kalimaa dho rahi he, na ab kaum koi padi so rahi he
 Why are you fascinated, wake up sleepers, dawn
 ' Trying to convey his point to everyone in different ways did not bring color every time
 angrezon ke us daur main apni baat kah paanaa itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 In such a situation, litterateurs took the initiative to reach people in their own way
 unhone upamaaon main baat karnaa shuru kii, yah vah tarika tha, jis par angrej bandish lagane se pehle isliye sochaa karte the, kyonki isamen saahitiyik put hua karata tha
 The same thing appears in Raza Naqvi's Manjhi song
 
 
 'badal bhi chamakate hai maanjhi, bijli bhi chamakati he maanjhi, The right left is silent and the night is dark, Manjhi bujhataa he man kaa diya maanjhi, Yes, the kayak ran fast, Manjhi
 ' Even the lullabies sung at that time were full of heroic juice
 akhtar shirani kii aisi hi ek lori he, jisaki line kuch is tarah hai
 
 
 This will dissuade the country and country from hundred lives, khuda kii or khuda ke hukum kii kidamat karegaa yah, It will always vow against everyone and other people, har ek par meharbaan hoga, meraa nanha javaan hoga


 Not only this, unlike today, people were also motivated to go to jail through songs of that time
 
 
 'suno goshe-dil se zaraa ye taraane, Warriors are strange, unique kahin shore-matam, kahin shaadiyane, Like this, the world will keep cutting, karo thodi himmat, na dhundho bahaane, Let's eat gel
 
 
 chalo jail khaane
 
 
 ' iske alaava shyaamalaal gupt 'parshad' kaa 'vijayi vishwa tirangaa pyaara' ko bhulaayaa nahin ja saktaa
 The sensations associated with the hanging of Jallianwala Bagh and Bhagat Singh were also incorporated into the songs
 aisa hi ek yaadgaar sher se judaa vaakya he, jab ashfak arya samaaj mandir (shahjahanpur) main bismil ke paas kisi kaam se gaye hue the or jigar muradaabadi kii yah gazal gunaguna rahe the


'koun jane ye tamanna ishk kii manzil main he
 The desire that came out of the heart, then what is seen in the heart
 ' When Bismil smiled upon hearing this lion, Ashfaq asked, 'why Ram brother! Did i say something wrong to Missra? ' To this, Bismil replied 'no my Krishna Kanhaiya! This is not the case
 main jigar sahab kii bahut izzat karata hum, magar unhone mirza gaalib kii puraani jameen par ghisa-pita sher kahkar koun-sa bada tir maar liya
 If i had given a new tone, i would have also called Irshad
 ' Ashfaq did not like this thing of Bismil, he said in a challenging tone, 'ram bhai! Now you will fall into it, i will agree that your thinking is of a higher status than the liver and Mirza Ghalib
 ' usee vakt pandit ramprasad 'bismil' ne yah sher padhaa


"sarfaroshi kii tamanna ab hamaare dil main he
 Want to see how much it is in bazu-e-qatil "comments yah sunate hi ashfaq uchhal pade or bismil ko gale lagaakar bole, "ram bhai! maan gaye, aap to ustaadon ke bhi ustad hai
 'although Ashfaq has read this ghazal many times, but there is still doubt about who wrote it? According to a report in the news website BBC Hindi, it was written by Bismil Azimabadi and was published in Qazi Abdul Ghaffar's magazine 'sabah' in 1922, after which it was banned by the British

 haalanki ab sabaki najar pradhanmantri narendra modi kii is byopic par he kyonki isamen unke jivan kii kai ghatnaon ko dikhaaya jayega, or is par virodhiyon kii najar rahegi
 Another hit of inflation is going to hit the pocket of people

 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) created history by winning 67 out of 70 seats in the Delhi Assembly
 bilkul aisa hi kuch bees saal pehle sikkim main hua tha
 When the Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF), formed in 1993, formed its government in the state the following year
 or uski ye satta aaj tak kaayam he
 Let's take a look at some similarities between AAP and Sikkim Democratic Front
 esadf ne sthapana ke agle saal apni sarkaar bana lee thi
 Similarly, the Aam Aadmi Party also gained power in Delhi in 2013, a few months after its formation
 or 2015 ke is chunaav main abhootpurv bahumat se sarkaar banaai
 2
 esadf kii vichaardhaara janatantric samaajwaad par aadhaarit he
 The party has equal rights for all religions and classes, with the idea of public rule
 vaise hi aam aadmi party kii vichaardhaara swaraj par aadhaarit he
 That means our rule, the rule of the people
 3
 Both the states of Delhi and Sikkim are small in size
 dilli main nau jile hai
 So four in Sikkim
 esadf ne jis tarah se jilavaar buniyadi muddon ko lekar shodh kiya
 Similarly, a team of AAP has been doing this in Delhi for the last two years
 4
 The SDF has continued in power since the 1994 election under the leadership of Pawan Kumar Chamling
 1999 or 2004 ke vidhansabha chunaav kii safalataa ke saath is party ne apni sthiti or majboot kii
 In the 2009 elections, the SDF won all 32 seats in the state
 uske baad sikkim kii ekmaatr loksabhaa seat par bhi kabja kar liya
 The Aam Aadmi Party won 28 of the 70 seats in Delhi in the 2013 assembly elections
 iske baad loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main punjab se party ke chaar saansad bhi chune gaye
 And in the recent election, the party won 67 out of 70 seats
 5
 Due to the hilly terrain, there is not much industry etc
 in Sikkim
 aay kaa sabase bada saadhan tourism he
 The SDF government kept trying to provide more facilities to the public in spite of less resources
 aam aadmi party bhi dilli kii janata ko zyada se zyada suvidhaayen dena chaahati he
 Road, water and electricity are the priority
 dilli sarkaar kii aay ke bade strot cells tex or exise hi hai
 6
 sikkim sarkaar ne rajya ke logon ko raahat dene ke liye sabhi karon or waite main katautee kar rakhi he
 Because of which there is not much pressure on the public
 isi tarah aap bhi rajyon ke karon main chhot kii pakshdhar he
 So that the lower section of Delhi can get relief 7
 esadf ne apni sarkaar ko janata ke prati javabdeh bana rakhaa he
 There is widespread surveillance to prevent corruption
 sabhi sarkari kaaryon ke liye samay nirdhaarit he
 Transparency in all state functions is maintained
 tex kaa puraa system online he
 The Aam Aadmi Party also talks of transparency between the government and the public
 8
 The SDF government has made every effort to strengthen the basic infrastructure of the state
 janata ko kai abhiyaanon main sidhe taur par shaamil kiya
 In order to make the state clean, the campaign was carried out
 aap bhi usee tarah dilli ko saaf suthra banane kaa vaada karti he
 The aim of the party is to develop cleanliness and greenery in slums and JJ colonies
 sikkim sarkaar ne rajya ke nagarikon ko unke shaharon ke vikaas or safai ke liye jimmedaar banaaya
 You also want to give this lesson to the people of Delhi that the citizens of the state should also follow their responsibilities
 saarvajanik sampatti ke prati jaagruk hon
 9
 har raajnneetik dal se kuch sanghathan or hote hai
 Youth, women and student organizations etc
 lekin esadf ke das alag-alag frontal sanghathan hai
 In addition to youth, women, students, laborers, retired employees, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other vehicle driving organizations are also included
 aam aadmi party bhi isi disha main sanghathan kaa vistaar kar rahi he
 AAP has made Aam Aadmi Party Auto Organization 'aas' an organization of auto drivers
 10
 The SDF government is providing free education and health services to the public
 rajya sarkaar ke kul bajet kaa 30 fisadi shiksha par kharch hota he
 The agenda of the Aam Aadmi Party is also similar
 party dilli main muft shiksha or swasth sevaaon kii vakaalat karti rahi he
 This was also a major electoral issue in the election
 11
 To make people cyber and internet friendly in the state, the Sikkim government has started a cyber village scheme
 jiske tahat gramin ilaakon ke logon ko internet ke zarie suchanaaen or kheti sambadhi jaankaree ekatra karne main suvidha hogi
 Similarly, in the election agenda, AAP had announced to provide free wi-fi facility to Delhi
 taaki har dilliwasi internet kaa muft istemaal kar sake

 Such a name, which every Hina wishes
 to aabida bhi isi khwaahish kaa shikaar ban gai
 But this was not the case from the beginning
 aabida ko jab maajid bhai ke bare main pataa chalaa to usne koi gafalat na paali
 But on that day, at a feast of marriage, he got a look at them
 aabida upar se sakht bani rahi
 But sheer sweetness filled the sweetness from inside
 kheer par pasaari gai sookhe piste kii parat sa uskaa man ho gaya
 Eager to get drowned in kheer
 aabida or maajid ek ho gaye
 Family happy, family happy
 magar sab yun hi to nahin chalanaa tha
 Otherwise how would the story be made
 ye kahani bhi na kisi thekedaar or ejeeniyar kii jugalbandi si he
 If you do not turn, do not smile, then why should anyone remember Ilm? aabida bich bich jaati, magar phir ek dar bhi
 Not that Majid's love interest should take him away
 ek baar silsilaa kuch yun bana ki aabida iske uske chalate maajid se lagaataar dur rahi
 Sometimes she would serve her mother-in-law in the in-law's house, sometimes she would get her sleep
 or udhar maajid uski yaad main pisane sa laga
 When the limit was reached, Jism got a den
 mona naam kii
 The case opened when this lady's attack stopped
 jaahid ne aabida ko bataa diya
 And here began the period of triple torture
 aabida ne jaahid ko nahin dutkaara
 Just wore a tricolor sheet of unflagging, compassion and heartache
 ek din besakhta mona ke dar pahunch gai
 Tell him this
 ki tu baccha na gira
 i will take care of you maajid ek aise dher sa ho gaya, jo baahar se thor dikhataa, magar bheetar aanch main jhulasata
 And Mona
 use to bas jism kii aag se pet ke liye roti pakaana aata
 Without being a child, a lot began to change
 bana kam, tutaa zyada
 Something else trying to connect
 or aakhir main jo bachaa, wo bas ek sabak tha
 Wild Pigeon Ismat Apa has a long story or a short novel
 is bahes ko vaise bhi aalochakon ke liye chhodana munasib hoga
 This story was good for us
 ise aap ek baar main hi pard lenge
 Manjar binds through small silks and details
 or phir kahani yun farrata bharti ki aap shikaayat bhi na kar pate ki abhi to thahar ankhon ne sustaaya tha
 To say something about Ismat Chughtai's story, craft or language, it would be cool to chug
 maine ye kahani padhi
 Got touched yaad rahegi

 The historic Ramlila Maidan in New Delhi has been witness to important political events many times, but this time it has become the center of discussion around the world about the fight for change of the system in the country
 saamaajik kaaryakarta anna hajaare isi maidan se vyavastha parivartan kaa shankhanaad kar chuke hai
 As a symbol of the victory of good over evil, Ravan Dahan is done every year in this Ramlila Maidan and this work has been done by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress President Sonia Gandhi for the last few years, but this time it is the turn of Dahan to burn corruption Anna Hazare's
 ramlila maidan kii aitihaasik prishthbhumi par yadi gaur kiya jaae to kaha jaataa he ki angrejon ne varsh 1883 main ise british sainikon ke shiviron ke liye taiyaar karavaaya tha
 Ramlila Maidan, spread over 10 acres between Ajmeri Gate and Turkman Gate, can stand one lakh people and if the police believe it has a capacity of 25 to 30 thousand people
 samay ke saath-saath puraani dilli ke kai sanghathanon ne is maidan main ramlila kaa manchan karnaa shuru kar diya or isi ke chalate isaki pahchaan ramlila maidan ke rup main ho gai
 During the freedom struggle of the country, leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Jayaprakash Narayan also chose this ground to protest
 ramlila maidan main disambar, 1952 main jammu-kashmir ke mudde ko lekar shyama prasad mukherjee ne satyagrah kiya tha, jisase sarkaar puri tarah se hill gai thi
 The country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru also held his public meetings in this ground in 1956-57
 britain kii maharani elizabeth ne 28 janvari, 1961 main isi maidan main ek badi jansabha ko sambodhit kiya tha
 In the presence of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on 26 January 1963 after the defeat in the 1962 war with China, the Sur Empress Lata Mangeshkar also presented a historical program in this ground
 unhone dil ko chhu lene vaale kavi pradeep dwaara likhit deshbhakti geet 'i mere vatan ke logon jaraa aankh main bhar lo pani, jo shahid hue hai unki jaraa yaad karo qurbaani' ko apni aawaaj di thi
 In 1965, during the fight against Pakistan, the same Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri gave the slogan of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan
 1972 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne bangladesh ke nirmaan or pakistan ke khilaaf yuddh main jeet kaa jashn manaane ke liye isi maidan par aitihaasik jansabha ko sambodhit kiya tha
 In 1975, Jayaprakash Narayan called for the overthrow of the Indira Gandhi-led government from this ground
 mahaan kavi ramdhaari singh dinakar kii prasiddh panktiya, 'singhaasana khaali karo ki janata aati he' ko logon ne ek naare ke taur par buland kiya tha
 Afraid of this huge rally, Indira Gandhi's government declared a state of emergency on the night of June 25-26, 1975
 haal ke dinon kii baat karen to yah vahi ramlila maidan he, jahaan yoga guru baba ramdev ne kaledhan ke mudde ko lekar sarkaar ke khilaaf aawaaj buland kii
 On June 5, 2011, police lashed sticks at Ramdev's supporters
 ab anna kaa aitihaasik andolan isi maidan main jari he
 He was sitting on the tree
 aap manch par
 He did not descend from the tree
 aap manch se nahin utre
 The difference is that he left the world and you all left humanity
 or ab usee gajendra kii maut par saare netaa bol rahe hai
 Speaking a lot par phir aakhir main ye bhi kah rahe hai ki is maut par raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 Now someone asks their leaders, who is doing politics again? par kah koi nahin rahaa
 No one is saying who is responsible for Gajendra's death? Gajendra went from Jantar Mantar in Delhi to his village and merged with Panchatattva
 lekin giddh ban kar samvednaa ke shav par chakkar lagate apane netaa ab bhi baaj nahin aa rahe
 While wrapping up death in martyrdom, someone is announcing a few pieces of paper, while on the pretext of Gajendra, someone has started cutting his political crop on the dry field
 achaanak desh kaa kisaan sabko pyaara ho gaya he
 Kejriwal sir, you do not get tired of rushing common people
 aapaki har baat, har vaada, har ladaai, har dharna aam aadmi se shuru hokar par aam aadmi par hi khatm hota he
 Then you are among those who say that VIP culture has to end, the common man has to get up and work himself
 par yahaan aapaki ankhon ke saamne ek aam aadmi ped par chadhataa he
 The noose tightens around the neck
 phir puri tasalli se vahiin intjaar karata he
 You were all
 aap sab jaan rahe the
 But what were you doing? waiting? That he hangs up, then you will come into action
 are aap agar ek naagarik hone kii jimmedaari hi us vakt nibhaa lete to aapako manish sisodiya ko saath lekar phir aspataal jane kii jarurat bhi nahin padati
 Mr
 Kejriwal 
 
 aap to aap
 What to say about your special Kumar Vishwas
 
 
 gajendra ko ped par tanga dekh rahe hai baqayada manch se puch rahe hai latak gaya kya? or phir lage haathon dilli police kii laanat-malamat shuru kar dete hai
 Vishwas Sahab is also a poet
 kehete hai kavi kaa dil bada komal hota he
 Instead of sending a damn to the police, Gajendra would have survived if he had taken 25 steps off the stage himself
 rahi baat dilli police kii
 So the police is generally infamous for arriving late on the spot
 par yahaan to haadase se pehle se hi police maujuud thi
 He had to climb the tree just in time
 par wo bhi vakt rahete ped par nahin chadh pai
 Gajendra was not the only one killed on this tree on Wednesday
 
 
 balki uske saath insaaniyat bhi dam tod gai
 Now as much as those who thunder on his death and spew venom cannot compensate Gajendra
 kya gajendra vaaki khudakushi karnaa chahta tha? kya wo khudakushi karne ke liye hi saikadon mile dur dausa se chal kar dilli pahunchaa tha? yaa phir wo kisi ke uksaave main aakar haadase kaa shikaar ho gaya? ye sawaal ham nahin uthaa rahe
 
 
 Rather, it is to say of Gajendra's own family
 
 
 jisane apni maut se pehle gharavaalon se kaha tha ki wo tivi par aaj tivi par aayega
 And at half past two in the afternoon he really came on TV
 aisa aayaa ki puure desh ne live dekha
 To him and his death
 par sawaal ab ye he ki gajendra ped par chadh kar sirf tamaashe ke taur par tivi par aana chahta tha yaa phir live apni maut dikhaane ke liye? agar wo sachmuch khudakushi karne kaa man pehle se bana chukaa tha or isiilie dilli ke jantar-mantar tak pahunchaa tha to phir uski aakhri parchi main khudakushi kaa koi zikr kyon nahin tha? dausa main hui olon kii barish se beshak gajendra kii fasal ko nuksaan hua tha
 
 
 But this was not a reason that he would commit suicide directly
 
 
 or wo bhi ghar se saikadon mile dur dilli ke dilli police ne aam aadmi party kii raily se pehle use do chitthiyaan likhin thi
 
 
 And both of them had decided not to gather more than 5 thousand crowds in the rally
 saath hi ye bhi kaha tha ki agar aisa hua to anhoni ho sakati he
 And according to the police, a crowd of more than 5 thousand had gathered in the rally
 to kya aam aadmi party kii raily main kisi anhoni kaa andeshaa dilli police ko pehle se tha? During the hearing, the Supreme Court said that the girls were given drugs in the shelter home
 yah sthiti bahut hi gambheer he
 The court also questioned the slow investigation of the CBI
 supreme court ne sibiai jaanch team ke afasaron ke transfar par bhi aapatti jataai
 The Supreme Court directed the CBI to file the list of the team and now the team of 20 September by tomorrow
 isse pehle supreme court ne kaha tha ki jaanch team main badlaav nahin hoga
 On the other hand, in this case the SP of Begusarai, Bihar said that the allegations against Manju Verma have not yet been found to be true

 unhone aarope lagaaya digvijay congress ke mahasachiv naa hokar jaish-e-mohammad ke mahasachiv hai
 When the film 'jungle Book' was released in Hindi in April 2016, there was excitement and excitement in watching the film from children to adults
 saalon pehle chote parde par kaa cartoon sho logon ke dilon main apni jagah banane vaala 'da jangal book' cartoon jab film kii shakl main rupahale parde par aayaa to film zyaadaatar logon kii bachapan kii yaaden taaja deen
 The sequel to 'the Jungle Book' has been started, and the voice of Irrfan Khan, Ompuri and Priyanka Chopra got the applause from the audience
 damdaar diarection, shandaar acting auki behtareen cinematic effects kii vajah se film ne khub kamai bhi kii
 Perhaps this is the reason why Mowgli, the beloved character of 'jungle Book', overshadowed Salman Khan at the box office's 'sultan'
 'da jangal book' ke hindi varjan main ye 5 sitare denge apni aawajji haa, ek online survey ke mutabik mughali ne online booking ke maamle main sultan ko dhobi pachhad di he
 According to a survey by 'book My Show', the country's largest online ticket booking company, 'the Jungle Book' won the top 10 films of the year
 'sultan', 'airlift', 'emes dhoni- da antold story', 'kabali', 'e dil he mushkil', 'dear jindagi' jaisi filmon ko peeche chhodte hue'da jangal book'online collection ke lihaaj se sabase top par rahi
 Although not even a week after the release of Aamir Khan's film Dangal, the film reached the third position after 'sultan', leaving behind other films
 kushti hi nahin dil bhi jeet gaya 'sultan'vahiin pehali baar kushti ke akhaade main apana johar dikhaa rahe sallun miyaan kaa daanv bhi mughali ko takkar nahin de paaya
 The film 'sultan' had every stunt of success, from story to drama, action, hit songs, but Mowgli's innocence still overshadowed Salman Khan's body

 The condition of this village is that neither boys and girls are getting married in this village, nor do any relatives come here
 unhen bhi lagata he ki agar unhone is gaanv kaa pani piya to wo bhi kidney main hone valibeemarike shikaar ho jaaenge

 student of da year 2 se ananyaa pandey ne shandaar debyue kiya
 Even though the film could not spread the magic like the first part, the acting of Ananya Pandey was appreciated
 kuch samay pehle ananyaa ne ek intervyuu ke dauraan kaha tha ki yues college main jarnalism ke course ke liye select kiye jane ke baad bhi ve vahaan par nahin ja pain kyonki unhen apni debyue film ke liye samay nikaalnaa tha
 An Insta user had said that his Ananya had never applied for any foreign university, calling it false
 ananyaa ne insta par pramaan ke saath karaara jawaab diya he
 He said, "I didn't want to do that
 mujhe nahin lagata he ki mujhe kisi ko kuch samajhane kii jarurat he
 But for some time, this false news has been spreading that i had not applied for USC admission
 ab baat had se zyada ho gai
 The most sad thing is that my family and friends are going through this
 jaisaa kii maine pehle bhi kaha tha ki main aneburg skool for comunication and jarnelism ke spring 2018 semester ke liye select kii gai thi
 "view this post on Instagram i didn't want to do this
" i didn’t feel like i needed to explain myself to anyone, but the rumours that i faked my admission at USC have been doing the rounds for a while now
 They've been getting out of hand, and it's even more unfair and sad that my family and friends have to go through this
 As I've stated earlier, i was accepted by Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at USC for a major in Communication in the Spring 2018 semester
 But since i was shooting for my first film and the release date later got pushed, i had to request for a deferral (which means postponing my admission) twice - first to Fall 2018 and later to Fall 2019, both of which they gracefully agreed to do
 In my case, i could only defer my admission two times so i will not be attending university (for now), since I’ve decided to pursue my career in acting
 As for the people who have been trying to pull me down with these accusations, i would like to send you all lots of love, peace and positivity
 And would also like to say that even though they’re claiming to be my classmates (nameless and faceless) - I'm sure they aren’t because I’ve grown up with the people i went to school with and they would never do something like that
 It's never okay to bully anyone - creating fake conversations, stories and screenshots is very dangerous and can seriously damage people's lives
 So please be loving, positive and kind
 PS (PS - my father's real name is Suyash and i blurred out my address for security reasons) a post shared byananya 👩🏻🎓💫 (@ananyapanday) onjun 8, 2019 at 2:36 am PDT "but because i made my first film The shoot was busy and the release date was shifted twice, i had to postpone my admission twice
 aisa pehali baar saal 2018 main hua tha or duusari baar saal 2019 main hua
 Both times my request was accepted
 mere cese main aisa he ki main sirf do baar hi apana admishan sthagit kar sakati hum to main ab universti nahin ja sakati
 Because of this i turned my attention to acting career
 ""jo log mujhe nicha dikhaanaa chaahate hai unke liye main dher sara pyaar, shanti or sakaaraatmakataa bhejnaa chaahati hum
 To those people who are calling me their friend, i want to tell that i do not have a friend who makes ID by the name of Fake
 mere dost bachapan se mere saath hai or unamem se koi bhi aisa kuch nahin karata he
 i request all of you to be affectionate, positive and kind
 bataa den ki instagram par ek ladki ne kaha ki ananyaa ne kabhi fahrren universti ke liye applie nahin kiya tha
 The man was calling himself Ananya's friend

 In fact, the Rajasthan government schools' timings for the pm's speech were reduced from 10 am to 4 pm from the first week of September
 lekin ab is garmi main bacchon ko skool jane main kaaphi kathinaayee jhelni pad rahi he
 The school administration had told the children that the time would be changed back after pm's speech but there was no change
 khud ke saath hue is dhokhe or bheeshan garmi main skool ja rahe bachche iskaa virodh karne sadakon par utar gaye
 In Jaipur's education complex, the girls surrounded the state education minister and started shouting slogans to change the school timings
 yahi nahin chaatraon ne shiksha mantri kii gaadi ke aage khadey hokar shiksha mantri hai-hai ke naare bhi lagaae
 Seeing the crowd growing, the officials cleared the way and sent the minister
 gauratlab he ki rajasthan main ye bakheda pradhanmantri narendra modi ke shikshak diwas par sambodhan ko lekar shuru hua he
 At that time, the schools were running from eight to one o'clock in the morning, but the government had fixed the time of all schools from 10 to 4 o'clock, which is from October 15 every year
 rajasthan main in dinon taapmaana 40 degree ke aasapaas he isliye skool timming ko lekar virodh ho rahaa he
 On the other hand, the state education minister Kalicharan Saraf was sitting in the air-conditioned room saying, 'this is routine work
 har saal sardiyon main 10 se 4 or garmiyon main 8 se 12 kaa time hota he, lekin piem ke bhaashan ke maddenjar agar ek maheene pehle timming badal di gai to isamen koun sa pahaad tut gaya he? virodh karne vaale ko virodh karne do!'is par rajasthan shikshak sanghathan ke adhyaksh ramakrishna agarwal ne shikshaamantri ke bayaan par jawaab dete hue kaha, 'ab shiksha mantri ji dhoop main paidal chalakar skulon main pahunche to pataa chale ki koun sa pahaad tut rahaa he
 There are still no buildings in the state's 350 schools where teachers vacation at 12 noon due to the heat
 'unhone yah bhi kaha ki nai sarkaar ne shiksha kaa bantaadhaar kar diya uskaa ek taaja saboot rajasthan ke skulon main chaatro kaa virodh he
 To please just one person without knowing the geographical location, it is unfair to change the school timings in this scorching summer where the temperature in barmer-jaisalmer is running 35-40 degrees
 aapako bataa den ki rajasthan main sardi disambar se shuru hoti he or philhal rajya main bheeshan garmi he
