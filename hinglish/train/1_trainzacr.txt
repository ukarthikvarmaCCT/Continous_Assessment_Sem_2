 Sehwag said during the moneygram ICC World Cup Trophy Tour event, 'it is very sad that Phil Hughes died this way
 pul shaat khilne kii koshish main
 The ball hit his head and he died
 lekin yah cricket jivan kaa hissaa he
 If you are part of a sport, then injuries will come your way
 aapaki maut bhi ho sakati he lekin aapako paas bounsar se jhukkar bachane kaa vikalp he
 So it depends on you as the batsman
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘agar aap bounsar ko hataa do to cricket ke khel main majaa nahin bachegaa
 Then it will be a game of bulls
 mujhe nahin lagata ki isisi aisa karegaa

 In Banaras, in other words, according to Hindu customs, bull bull is considered to be a ride, and this is probably why bulls are given special respect here

 haalanki bajpur main arya ek aisa cheharaa maane jane lage hai jo saamaajik sameekaran kaa barier tod jeet darj kar sakate hai
 BJP has also made this seat a question of prestige, so Rajesh Kumar, a leader of the Sangh background and a strong ticket contender, is walking around with Arya
 arya kaa kahana he ki uttarakhand main congress ab ek gut vishesh kii party rah gai he jiskaa koi siddhant nahin, isliye baari man se 40 saal puraani congress ko chhodia padaa
 Now the bjp's strategy is to hold a public meeting of Prime Minister Modi in these three areas so that the contest of thorns can be converted into saffron wave
 iske liye srinagar, rudraprayag or haridwar main jansabha hogi
 The manner in which the rebels dominate this time in the Modi vs Rawat Uttarakhand assembly elections has changed the course of the electoral debate
 tarai main saamaajik sameekaran to kumaun main sthaneey samasya or gadhwal main chehre ahm ho gaye hai
 There is no anger, no anger in the public about demonetisation, but despite the impact on business from Roorkee to Garhwal to Srinagar and Yamkeshwar, says, "damage has happened, but where will the BJP go?" Says a government official, "one rank, one pension and appointment of Bipin Rawat as army chief have raised hopes from the Modi government, so they also want BJP government in the state Lets '' jabaki duusari taraf march main barkhaastagi vaale mudde se upji sahanubhuti ko mukhyamantri harish ravat barkaraar nahin rakh paae
 The BJP is also cautious, so the MLA is not showing much speed despite filing a CBI case in the case of horse-trading, as it would allow Rawat to reap the sympathy
 sutron ke mutabik, ravat ne khaas taur se un siton par micromanagement kiya he jin par baagi bijepi se chunaav lard rahe hai
 While most of the BJP candidates are seeing reflection of their victory in Modi's image itself
 baagi bigaadenge samikarnauttarakhand ke chunavi mukaable main tarai kii kuch siton par bispi bhi takat laga rahi he
 Though the real contest is between BJP and Congress, but the rebels are spoiling the equation of both parties
 namakan waapas lene kii miyaad khatm hone ke baad bijepi ke 25 to congress ke 28 baagi maidan main date hai
 If the political career of Harish Rawat from Congress is at stake, then the BJP has increased the possibility of fratricide by deciding to enter the field without face
 is baar bijepi se satpal maharaj ne chunaav ladgaye kii ichha jataa di, lekin chubattakhaal seat par purv siem ramesh pokharial nishank ke kareebi maane jane vaale kavindra ishtwaal maharaj kaa sameekaran bigaadpee ke liye nirdaleey maidan main utar chuke hai

 Sincerely: newsflicks mahatma gandhi ke rakt ke boond se sani ghaas or mitti kii nilaamee kiye jane se pehle congress ne vishwaas jataayaa he ki sarkaar aisi sthiti ko taalane main safal hogi jisase logon kii bhavanaaen aahat ho
 This grass and soil belong to the same place where the Father of the Nation was killed in 1948
 party pravaktaa abhishek singhvi ne kaha, ‘is baat kaa bharosa rakhiye ki sarkaar aise kisi kadam ko anumati nahin degi jisase bharat ke logon kii bhavanaaen aahat ho kyonki mahatma gandhi kaa na keval bharat balki puri duniya main sammaan he
 Tusshar Gandhi, the great-grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, has expressed concern over the auction
 britain ke nilaamee ghar mulak is nilaamee kii yojana bana rahaa he
 He hopes that he can get up to Rs 85 lakh from this auction
 bina soche paise kharch karnaa amiron kii shaan hoti he lekin madhyam vargeey parivaar ke liye to kam paise main jaruraton ko puraa karte hue ghar chalaanaa ek badi chunauti hoti he
 This is the reason that if some big and expensive shopping has to be done in a month, then the budget of the house gets derailed and you have to adjust the whole month
 koi badi kharidari jaruri bhi ho or aap nahin chaahate ki iskaa ghar kharch par zyada asar pade yaa phir bhavishya main is saamaan kii vajah se aapako pachhataanaa pade, to apni jeb dhili karne se pehle apane aap se ye 5 sawaal jarur puuchhen
 1
 kya ye mere bajet main he?darasal kai baar aap laalach, shauk yaa kisi se bhahekaave main aakar badi kharidari kar lete he jisaki vajah se puure maheene aapako apni choti-choti jaruraton kaa tyaag karnaa padataa he
 Therefore, it is better to do good planning before such purchase, if the goods are in the budget then only buy or else collect the money in two-three months and buy goods
 2
 Will i need this item in future? One thing always keep in mind that the goods you are going to buy should not be 'one time use'
 agar bhavishya main bhi aapako uski jarurat padane vaali ho tabhi kharidne kaa faisla karen
 Because for the need of one or two times, you can also arrange goods by asking someone
 3
 Are these things durable? The quality of anything matters a lot
 saamaan kii quality ko parakhnaa bhi ek kala he
 Some people are not able to buy good quality goods even by paying much money and become a victim of the thugs
 aise main apane saath us saamaan ke jaankaar ko saath le jaaen yaa phir khud se samajhadaari baraten
 4
 kya ye iskaa wajif mulya he?kai baar aisa hota he ki jo saamaan aap kharid kar laate he wo duusari dukaan yaa websites par kam daam main mil rahi hoti he
 In such a situation, before buying anything big, you must do a good research
 kai baar to websites par mil rahediscounts ofroor coupon se daam par kaaphi fark pad jaataa he
 5
 isaki ritern policy kya he?saamaan ghar lene jane kii jaldbaaji main uski rirton policy ke bare main jaankaree lenaa na bhoolen
 Not only this, the guarantee and warranty of the goods should also be inquired in a manner so that if the goods are defective within the warranty period, then they can be serviced or exchanged for free
 kai aise dukandaar hote hai jo chije waapas nahin karte isliye is sab kaa jayja kharidari ke vakt hi le len

 But why so? The government says that there is a shortage of sugar in the country because the monsoon betrayed it
 lekin kya ye sach he? nahin ye sach nahin he
 This is a story through which people are being tricked
 chini kii mahangaai kaa asli sach chaukaanewaala he
 Till now it has been said that monsoon has not improved
 desh main ganne kii paidaavaar kam hui or isliye chini ke daam lagaataar bad rahe hai
 But this is half true
 balki yun kaha jaae ki ye aadha jhooth he
 Monsoon cheated
 desh main ganne kii paidaavaar bhi thodi kam hui ye hakeekat kaa ek pahalu he lekin isaki asli vajah jaanakar hairat hogi
 Till date, it has been discovered that the real culprits of sugar inflation have caused the tea to fade, the taste of the sweets has turned bitter
 un sabakaa cheharaa hoga benakaab
 Sugar bags are kept in Gujarat's Kandla port warehouses as far as is seen
 puraa godaam chini se ata padaa he
 This is the sugar that has been sourced from abroad and which can be directly launched in the market
 yaa yun samajhie ki ye wo chini he jo qamar tod mahangaai se pareshaan logon ko raahat pahunchaa sakati hai
 But for about 6 months, it has been lying in the sugar godowns
 kandla bandargah par chini kii boriyon se bhare aise ek do godaamon nahin
 There are more than 100 warehouses within a radius of several kilometers and there is a stock of directly used white sugar sacks or raw sugar
 ajtak kii team ne jitne godaamon kaa jayja liya unamem se 8 main safed chini kii boriyon kaa ambara mila auki kareeb 20 se 22 godaamon main ro sugar kaa ambara yani aisi chini jise mil main ripine karke istemaal ke laayak banaaya ja saktaa he
 The question arises that when sugar prices are on the sky in the country, why is so much sugar kept in warehouses? Why are people not being given relief by releasing these millions of tons of sugar in the market? The real game of Chinese bitterness is hidden in the response to the question
 log chini kii mahangaai se pareshaan hai, lekin gujarat ke kandla bandargah ke godaamon main kareeb 11 lakh ton chini pichley kai maheenon se yun hi padi hai
 Experts say that these have been held up in the Chinese market to raise profits by increasing prices
 ye jaanakar aap hairaan rah jaaenge ki yahi chini agar vakt par bazaaron main utaar di gai hoti to naa to chini kii keemat main is kadar aag lagati auki naa hi desh ke majaboor aam logon kii jeben is kadar katati

 But this whole matter is now raising many questions and the biggest question among them is to incite, influence and work for terrorist organizations like IS through internet

 Is it possible that the internet can be regulated in any way
 is tarah ke contate jo naujavaanon ke dimag main zehar bharte hai unhen filter kar baahar kiya ja sake
 Just a few months ago, a public interest litigation was filed in the Supreme Court to ban pornography on the Internet, but the government found it difficult to regulate the Internet
 kai deshon main child porn pratibandhit he, lekin tab bhi puri tarah se ye desh use bhi filter karne main naakaam rahe hai
 In such a situation, how much success will be achieved in stopping the spread of terror through the Internet, or even how much of this will be a universal step

 The longest lunar eclipse of the 21st century is seen today i
e
 on 27 July
 is par duniyabar kii nigahen tiki hai
 Full lunar eclipse will be seen in India
 deshbhar ke kai ilaake main purna chandragrahan ko dekhne ke liye kai tarah ke intjaam kiye gaye hai
 It is being told that the effect of lunar eclipse in India is 10 late at night
 53 baje se hi dikhnaa shuru ho jayega
 The shape of the moon will change with time
 The effect of Chandra grahan will start showing in India from late night
 dhire-dhire chand kaa rang laal hota jayega or ek samay aisa aayega jab chand puri tarah se gaayab ho jayega
 10 late Friday night
 53 baje -chand par grahan kaa asar shuru hoga, haalanki nangi ankhon se kuch nahin dikhegaa
 11
 54 baje -dhire-dhire grahan kaa asar nangi ankhon se dekh paaenge
 Late 1 night
 51 baje- chandragrahan apane sarvocch str par hoga, ye hi purna chandragrahan hoga
 2
 43 baje -dhire-dhire grahan kaa asar kam hoga
 Saturday morning 5
 00 baje -chandragrahan kaa asar khatm hoga
 Due to lunar eclipse, many big temples across the country will be closed after noon
 haridwar, varanasi or elahabaad main har shaam hone vaali ganga aarti bhi dopaher ko hogi
 Due to lunar eclipse, special Ganga Aarti will be organized at 1 pm
 desh ke kai bade mandiron main dopaher do baje ke baad darshan nahin ho paaenge
 The doors of kedarnath-badrinath will be closed after noon and the doors of Kedarnath temple will remain closed from Friday afternoon to Saturday morning
 aisa chandragrahan ke kaaran ho rahaa he
 During the lunar eclipse there will also be no recitation of worship in the temple
 shri badrinath kedarnath mandir samiti ke piaaro da
 Giving this information, Harish Goud said that before the sutak period of lunar eclipse on 27 July, the doors of Shri Badrinath Temple will be closed at 12
30 minutes and the doors of Shri Kedarnath Temple at 2
54 minutes in the day
 duusare din subah grahan samaapt hone ke baad niyamit puja archana ke liye unhen phir se khol die jaayenge
 The lunar eclipse starts at 114
45 in the night, the eclipse period will be on 28 July at 3
49 am, Shri Badrinath Temple and Shri Kedarnath Temple will open at dawn on 28th July for their scheduled time
 chandra grahan kyon hota he?iskaa sidhaa sa jawaab he ki chandramaa kaa prithvi kii oot main aa janaa
 In that case the Sun is on one side, the Moon on the other side and the Earth in the middle
 jab chandramaa dharti kii chaaya se nikalataa he to chandra grahan padataa he
 The lunar eclipse falls on the full moon day, but the lunar eclipse falls on the full moon day, but not every full moon has a lunar eclipse
 iskaa kaaran he ki prithvi kii kaksha par chandramaa kii kaksha kaa jhuke hona
 This inclination is about 5 degrees so each time the moon does not enter the Earth's shadow
 uske upar yaa neeche se nikal jaataa he
 The same is true for solar eclipse
 suryagrahan hameshaa amavasya ke din hote hai kyonki chandramaa kaa aakaar prithvi ke aakaar ke mukaable lagbhag 4 guna kam he
 Its shadow is of small size on the earth, so in the state of perfection, solar eclipse can be seen only from a small part of the earth
 lekin chandra grahan kii sthiti main dharti kii chaaya chandramaa ke mukaable kaaphi badi hoti he
 So it takes more time for the moon to pass through it

 aapane logon ko khush hokar apane naukaron ko bakhshish dete to dekha hoga, lekin koi maalik apane naukar kii khidamat se is kadar khush ho jaae ki use bakhshish main chah sau karod kii daulat de de, aisa naa to dekha hoga or naa hi suna hoga
 In Rajkot, a servant received a bequest of six hundred crores from his boss in such a way that the servant himself was kidnapped by his own relatives
 is naukar kii ek roj aise takadir ne karavat badali ki dekhte hi dekhte ab ye shaks chah sau karod kaa maalik ban gaya
 Everybody who knows him along with this person himself is surprised at this miracle of fortune telling from a film story, but this person from Rajkot did this feat neither by winning a lottery nor by handing over a mysterious treasure
 balki ye mumkin hua he ek aisi vasiyat kii badaulat, jiske saamne aate hi kal tak muflisi main jenevaala ye shaks aaj ilaake ke sabase amir logon main shumaar kiya jane laga he
 Kanak Jaipal alias Vinubhai used to be a minor servant of Gajraj Singh Jadeja, a zamindar of Rajkot and well-known politician
 ek aisa naukar, jiske din kii shuruyaat apane maalik kii timaradaari se hoti or maalik ke timaradaari se hi khatm hoti, lekin unke maalik gajraj singh jadeja ne apni ankhen kya band kii, vinubhai kii takadir hi khul gai
 On the go, Gajraj Singh Jadeja gave the entire wealth of his six hundred crores to his favorite servant Vinubhai, but this story of making a servant heir to such a great wealth is as interesting as the story before and after
 Shocking, because if Vinubhai got a sense of comfort from this wealth, then the trouble also got free
 ise 40 saalon kii vafadari kaa inaam kahen yaa phir apane hi rishtedaaron se mili rusavaai kaa nateeja, rajkot ke jameendaar gajraj singh jadeja ne jab vinubhai ke naam ye vasiyat likhi, to isaki bhanak khud us shaks ko bhi nahin thi, jiske naam ye vasiyat likhi ja rahi thi
 Three months after the death of the zamindar, as soon as this rule came to light, along with the wealth came the servant's help
 is vasiyat ke mutabik gajraj singh kii is aaleeshaan haveli ke saath-saath tamaam jameen-jaaydaad, heere-jawaharaat or rupye-paison kaa maalik koi or nahin, balki vahi vinubhai the, jo pichley 40 saalon tak unke saath rah kar har pal unki seva karte rahe
 In this unique story of loyalty of a servant and generosity of the owner, a big twist came when a few days ago, relatives of Gajraj Singh suddenly attacked his mansion
 darasal, gajraj singh ke jane ke baad is haveli main vinubhai hi apane parivaar ke saath rah rahe the
 
 
 But in the meantime, when Gajraj Singh's nephew and other relatives got the news of his uncle's will, he lost his temper and raided this mansion to teach Vinubhai everything and grab a wealth of six hundred crores
 vinubhai or unke gharavaalon kii maane to unke maalik ke bhatijon ne iske baad naa sirf unke saath marpet kar kai dastavejon par dastakhat karvaa liye or unhen ghanton bandhak bhi banaae rakhaa
 When the police got the news of this and the uniformed men stormed this mansion, then Vinubhai and his family got freedom from being held hostage
 kheti or property ke kaarobaar se 37 saalon main mahaz kuch hazaar rupayon se chah sau karod kii property banaanevaale gajraj singh ne shaadi nahin kii thi, lekin unke jite-ji vinubhai ne unka jitna khyaal rakhaa, usase wo apane is naukar ke hi mureed ban kar rah gaye
 On the other hand, Gajraj Singh's relationship with his relatives and especially his nephews was not very good
 lihaaja, 1993 main jab unhen paralisis kaa atake hua, to gajraj singh ne apane dimag main chal rahi is baat ko kaagajon par utaarne kaa faisla kar liya or phir ek roj apane vakeelon ko bulavaa kar wo kaam kar diya, jiske bare main aam taur kisi ke liye sochna bhi mumkin nahin hota
 People tell that Gajraj Singh used to stay in a mansion when he used to come to Rajkot, in connection with the work and in those days, innocent Vinu served Gajraj Singh in this mansion and just then, from those days, Vinu Gajraj Singh's heart was such that he took it with him
 iske baad gajraj singh ne hi uski shaadi karwaai or uske bacchon kii parvarish or padhai kharchaa uthaaya or to or gajraj singh ke paison se hi vinubhai ke teen bacchon ne hindustan se lekar england tak jaakar talim lee or ab gajraj singh ke jane ke baad vinubhai or unka puraa parivaar hi unka asli vaaris ban chukaa he
 a leading Pakistani newspaper 'dawn' on Wednesday dismissed allegations of news of 'vested interest and false reporting'
 darasal, aatankwaadiyon ko paroksh samarthan par asainya or sainya netritv ke bich daraar hone kii reporting karne ke chalate iske patrkaar par sarkaar ne videsh jane par roak laga di thi
 Dawn has stated in his editorial that Cyril Almeida's report about the conflict between the government and the military was properly verified and was correct reporting
 is report ne desh main maahaul kaaphi garam kar diya he
 'dawn' columnist Cyril Almeida said yesterday that his name had been put on the exit control list

 a day after his retirement, on Sunday, Sachin Tendulkar openly presented himself to the world
 sachin ne kaha ki 24 saal or ek din kaa unka antarrashtriya kariyar ek svarnim safar kii tarah rahaa he or ise lekar unhen kisi se koi shikaayat nahin
 Sachin said that of course his body is no longer with the Indian team but with mind and prayers he will always be associated with his team
 mumbai ke paanch sitara hotel trident main yojit samvaadadaata sammelan main sachin ne kaha ki ab vah bharat kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karenge lekin man se vah hameshaa team india ke saath rahenge
 Sachin said, "even though i do not play for the country with my body, but with my mind i am always with my team and will keep praying for its victory all the time
 main hameshaa yahi sochoongaa ki bhartiya team sheersh par rahe
 " sachin ne kaha ki vah bhi is baat ko lekar kabhi-kabhi hairaan ho jate hai ki vah kis tarah 24 saal tak desh ke liye khelte rahe lekin ek baat unhen iskaa jawaab de detii he ki unke andar is khel ke liye aseem jajba or kuch kar dikhaane kaa hausala tha
 "sachin has been a golden journey for me for 24 years and one day
" maine apane is kariyar main kai utaar-chadhaav dekhe
 i have no complaints with anyone
 main khush hum ki maine sahi samay par sanyas kaa faisla kiya
 " sachin ne sweekaar kiya ki 24 saal ke cricket ke baad sharir unka saath chhodane laga tha or usee ke dwaara die gaye sanket ko aadhaar banaakar unhone sanyas kaa faisla kiya
 Sachin, who made his international debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan, retired on Saturday after 24 years and a day
 sachin ne 11 saal kii umr main cricket shuru kiya tha
 In this context, he continued to play 30 out of 40 years of his life
 sachin ne kaha, "meraa sharir dabaav nahin jhel paa rahaa tha
 He indicated me
 main pehle kii tarah workout nahin kar paa rahaa tha
 i used to feel like watching a little TV during a training session
 yah mere liye ek tarah kaa sanket tha
 This had raised the question that the mind is still Rama in cricket but the body is not supporting it
 aise main kya karnaa chahie
 Then i announced my retirement
 " One of the greatest batsmen in the world, Sachin said that Saturday was a day for him
 sachin ke mutabik vah kai maukon par bhaawanaaon main bahe or isaki sabase badi vajah yahi thi ki aage vah antarrashtriya str par bharat ke liye nahin khel paaenge
 Sachin said that he got emotional on many occasions and on some occasions his eye also got filled
 iske peeche sirf yahi vajah tha ki shanivaar kaa din unke antarrashtriya kariyar kaa aakhri din tha
 Sachin said, "I got emotional when my colleagues gave me the guard of honor
 maidan kaa chakkar lagaate vakt jab kohli or dhoni ne mujhe uthaaya, tab main bhaavnaatmak hua
 After this i got emotional while talking to the pitch
 mere jivan kaa yah anmol pal tha
 In such a situation how good feelings do not dominate
 " On the question related to bowing the salute after his 200th and final Test at Wankhede Stadium, Sachin said that he really wanted to thank cricket for all that cricket has given them
 sachin ne yah bhi sweekaar kiya ki antim baar ballebaaji ke liye jate vakt unki ankhe bhar ai thim lekin unhone is baat ahsaas kisi ko nahin hone diya kyonki isse unki kamajori ujagar ho sakati thi
 Sachin said that cricket has been an oxygen for him
 sachin ne kaha, "cricket meri jindagi rahi he
 i have said many times before that it works as oxygen for me and i am saying the same today
 maine apni jindagi ke 40 saal main se 30 saal cricket khelaa he or jabaki ritair ho chukaa hum, yakeen nahin ho rahaa he ki ab main desh ke liye nahin khel sakuunga
 " sachin se ek sawaal yah bhi kiya gaya ki vah arjuna ko kis tarah ke khilaadi ke taur par dekhnaa chaahate hai? iske jawaab main sachin ne sirf itnaa kaha ki arjuna ko akelaa chhod dijie or use apane khel kaa lutf lene dijie
 Sachin said that his parents never put any pressure on him nor did the media put any pressure on him at that time on his father and writer Ramesh Tendulkar
 or agar daalaa hota to shaayad unke saath main kalam hoti
 This great athlete dedicated the 'bharat Ratna' to the countrymen and crores of mothers, who make all the sacrifices to raise their children and make them capable
 sachin ne kaha ki vah aisi sabhi maataaon ko salaam karte hai kyonki vah jaanate hai ki unki maa ne unhen is kaabil banane ke liye kitna balidaan kiya he

 Chinese technology company Xiaomi has launched the mid-range budget smartphone A1 in India
 yah smartphone china main launch kiye gaye Mi 5X kaa doosraa vairient kaha ja saktaa he
 Because the specifications are the same, but some major changes have been made in it
 is smartphone ke liye company ne google ke saath partnership kii he or isamen Android One diya gaya he
 The company has marketed it from Created By Xiaomi Powered by Google
 android van hone kii vajah se isamen agle kaa varjan kaa android milanaa tay he
 Android Oreo will be available by the end of this year
 itnaa hi nahin company ne yah bhi saaf kiya he ki yah un chand smartfones main se ek hoga jisamen Android p diya jayega
 In the review of this smartphone, we will tell you how the performance of this smartphone is, how it looks, whether its battery meets the backup claim and how its camera is
 chunki isamen dual camera seoup he or company ne isaki kaaphi marketing bhi kii he khaas kar iphone 7 Plus se ise compair kiya gaya he
 The build quality is of MI A1 metal and its build quality is solid and it is not less than a premium smartphone
 iske antena lines upar kii taraf hai or camera bamp die gaye hai jisamen do lens lage hai
 If you have seen oneplus 5 and iphone 7 Plus, then it is more or less similar in terms of smartphone design
 body metal kii he or spikar gril neeche kii taraf diya gaya he
 At the bottom of the rear of this smartphone, you will find the branding of androidone and will also be written here Made in India
 kyonki company ne ise bharat ke hi plant main taiyaar kiya he
 Display Mi A1 5
 5 inch kii phul echdi disple di gai he or iskaa glass 2
 The 5D is curved due to which it is quite easy to use
 haalanki company ne aisi hi disple Redmi Note 4 main di he
 But there are some improvements in the Mi A1
 protection ke liye isamen gorilla glass 3 diya gaya he
 We used its display bright to use and you will be able to use it well, especially in the light of the sun
 yani disple ke contant dekhne main aapako koi pareshaani nahin hogi
 The image and text look better and sharper
 vuing angel kii baat karen to isamen yah best to nahin lekin thik thaak hi he
 Colors look good and do not prick in the eyes
 camera testsdhomi Mi A1 main dual rier camera seoup he
 a lens is 12 megapixels wide angle and its aperture f / 2
 2 he
 While the second 12 megapixel telephoto lens has been given, its aperture f / 2
 6 he
 For selfie, it has a 5 megapixel selfie camera
 iske alaava isamen 2X optical juum diya gaya he or duusare stantard camera fitures uplabdh hai
 The special thing is that the company has compared the MI A1 camera to the iphone 7 Plus and oneplus 5
 haalanki tulaan sirf boke effect yani bekgrand bler karne ke liye hi kii gai
 Background blurring is a feature of DSLR which is now in trend even in smartphones
 bekground bler karke tasviren clic karne kii baat karen to yah phone iske liye behtareen hai
 The photos are good and the detailing is fine too
 lekin jaisaa company ne daawa kiya tha ki yah iphone 7 Plus se bhi behtareen bekground bler karata he aisa nahin he
 We took pictures with depth effects from Mi A1 and iphone 7 Plus, in which iphone 7 Plus has proved to be better
 Mi A1 kaa camera is segment ke hisaab se prabhavit karata he
 Talking about common photography, both of its cameras are excellent and you can click good pictures
 ab baat parformens kidani A1 parformens main aapako niraash nahin karata
 Let us know why we are saying this
 is main qolkom snapadragon 625 procesar lagaaya gaya he jo is segment kaa best he or yah multi tasking ke liye kaaphi behatar he
 The 4GB RAM given in this makes this smartphone fast and switching from one app to another is quite easy
 loding time kam he or kaaphi smood he
 We have tried it by playing Asphalt 8 and some other similar games
 gaming ke dauraan yah smartphonthoda garm jarur hua, lekin yah lag nahin karata
 Gaming can be done comfortably and 5
 5 inch kii phul echdi disple hone kii vajah se yah acha anubhav
 Apart from hardware, the performance of any smartphone also depends on which operating system it is
 software (android one)mi A1 ke behtareen parformens kii vajah na sirf hardware he balki isamen diya gaya stock android van he jo kaaphi simple he or isamen aapako blotware nahin milenge
 Xiaomi has some apps, the rest of Google's apps are given
 multi tasking bhi karne main aapako koi pareshaani nahin hogi, haalanki ek baar phir bataa den ki agar ek baar main zyada eps yuj karte vakt hamaara phone garm jarur hua
 But there is no problem of being slow or hanging
 aane vaale samay main isamen android oriyo milegaa to yah or bhi behatar ho saktaa he
 This smartphone is amazing in terms of software customization
 bydariclic karen or padhein MI A1 ke spacificationsisamen die gaye procesar yani kwalkom snapadragon 625 kii ek khaasiyat jo hamen pasand ai wo ye he ki yah bydaree efficient he
 Despite having less power than Redmi Note 4, it will not disappoint you in terms of backup
 isame 3,080mah kii bydaree di gai he or puure din aaraam se chalaa sakate hai
 We have told you the backup of mixed use
 lekin din main aap thik thik videos dekhte hai, colling karte hai or soshal media par active rahete hai connactivity ke saath to shaam hone se pehle aapako bydaree charge karne kii jarurat hogi
 Should you take this phone? Overall this smartphone is a great package
 hardware, software, dizin, camera or bild quality aapako niraash nahin karenge
 Currently, not all departments of this segment of smartphones in the market are as good as the Mi A1
 agar aap is bajet kaa smartphone khareednaa chaahate hai to yah aapaki opshan list main number-1 he

 Bored with the party, here are the top 5 ways to spend the weekend
 
 
 duniya kaa har ballebaaj bhartiya master blaster sachin tendulkar ke recordon ke kareeb pahunchnaa chahta he, lekin is star ballebaaj ke naam par ek aisa record bhi darj he, jiske aasapaas bhi shaayad hi koi cricketer pahunchnaa chahega
 This is the record, the record of returning to the pavilion before completing a century after scoring 90 runs, which is called 'nervous Ninties'
 sachin tendulkar test or ek-divasiy antarrashtriya cricket main sarvaadhik baar 'nervas nintiz' kaa shikaar hone waalon kii suchi main sheersh par hai
 He has been a victim of nervous ninties 10 times in Tests, 18 times in one-day internationals (including once unbeaten)
 so, antarrashtriya cricket main shatakon kaa shatak thokane kaa vishwarecord banane vaale sachin tendulkar ke kariyar main 28 maukey aise aae, jab vah shatak ke kareeb pahunchane ke baavjood use hasil nahin kar paae
 Anyway, hardly any batsman can reach this record of Sachin Tendulkar, because after him, Rahul Dravid (14 times) of India is second in the list of 'nervous Nights' victims, and he is already in international cricket
 Have said goodbye to suchi main shaamil jo khilaadi ab bhi khel rahe hai, unamem dakshin africa ke jaik kallis 13 baar 'nervas nintiz' kaa shikaar bane
 As far as the record of Test matches is concerned, apart from Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Steve Waugh of Australia also returned to the pavilion between 10 and 90 runs 10 times
 sachin tendulkar ek-divasiy antarrashtriya cricket kii ek pari main 90 ran bana lene ke baad 18 baar shatak se chuke hai, or suchi main unke baad greem flower, nathan estal or arvind disilva kaa number aata he, jo nau avasaron par shatak banane se vanchit rah gaye
 There was an opportunity in these 18 innings when Sachin Tendulkar returned unbeaten after scoring 96 runs
 sachin tendulkar sabase zyaada baar varsh 2007 main 'nervas nintiz' kaa shikaar bane
 This year he was dismissed six times in one-day International cricket and once in a Test match between 90 and 99
 ek-divasiy antarrashtriya maichon main to us varsh vah teen baar 99 ran banaakar pavilion laute, jo ek alag record he
 Apart from this, Sachin Tendulkar missed four times in the year 2000, twice in the years 1997, 2003, 2005 and 2011 by scoring a few runs
 purv bhartiya captain mohammad ajaharuddin kii captaini main unka apni pariyon ko shatak main tabdeel karne kaa record acha rahaa he
 While being captain of Mohammad Azharuddin, he was a victim of 'nervous Ninties' only three times, while the number of such scores under the captaincy of Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid was seven, and in the matches led by Mahendra Singh Dhoni he was six' Nervous
 Ninties' out
 sachin tendulkar jab swayan captain the, tab bhi vah chaar avasaron par 90 ran ke paar pahunchane ke baavjood shatak puraa nahin kar paae the
 Apart from this, Tendulkar has had to return to the pavilion between 80 and 89 runs a record 30 times
 is suchi main unke baad jaik kallis (26 baar), bryan lara (22 baar), saurav ganguli (21 baar) or rahul dravid (20 baar) kaa number aata he
 He has returned to the pavilion 12 times between 80 and 89 runs in Tests

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke jubaani hamale kaa jawaab dete hue ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ne apni maa kii ore se die gaye sanskaron kaa hawala dete hue mangalvaar ko kaha ki vah pradhanmantri narendra modi par nijee hamale nahin karenge, bhale hi modi ne aisa kiya ho
 Initiating the election campaign for the bjp-shiv Sena alliance in Wardha, Maharashtra, PM Modi on Monday claimed that the NCP chief withdrew his name from the Lok Sabha elections due to adverse situation
 pradhanmantri ne sharad pavaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha tha ki party par se pavaar kii pakad dhili ho rahi he or unke bhattije ke chalate upji paariwarik kalah se ensipi kamjor pad gai he
 The Prime Minister had appealed to Sharad Pawar to clear his stand even after Omar Abdullah's 'two Prime Ministers' remarks on the previous day
 nijee hamale kar rahe hai modiensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ne mangalvaar ko pradhanmantri modi ke hamale ke jawaab main kaha, 'modi jahaan bhi ja rahe hai vahaan nijee hamale kar rahe hai
 But i will not do this because i am impressed by the rites given by my mother
 nijee aalochana hamaari samskruti main uchit nahin baithti
 He also said that the Prime Minister need not worry about family feud in NCP

 On the political attacks on her father, NCP MP Supriya Sule said, 'the Prime Minister's saying is unexpected

 The Prime Minister also said that Pawar decided not to contest the election because he realized that the situation was not in his favor

 unka yah vaada rijhaane laayak tha, kyonki isamen un museebaton kaa ilaaj bhi chipa tha, jo 1991 ke baad sudhaaron kii khuraaq se bhi dur nahin huin
 By shrinking the government, Prime Minister Modi was going to end a thousand kinds of waste, hundreds of ways of corruption and innumerable nefarious leader-officer alliances

 raajnneeti main jitne adhik log aaenge, sarkarein utani hi badi hoti jaaengi or bhrashtachar utana hi jaruri hoga
 Prime Minister Modi could not handle the ideal of a small government by spreading the BJP across the country, so his government grew bigger

 In spite of the 2-year-long famine in the country for the last two-and-a-half years, today, with the support of 1
25 billion countrymen, India has made its presence in the global economy as a "bright spot" i
e
 a shining star
 aisa nahin he kii yah daawa ham kar rahe hai, balki yah aawaaj international monetary fund (IMF) or world bank se gunj rahi he
 Brothers and sisters, our motto in this race of development has been "sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas"

 The main weapon of our fight against poverty has been the active participation of the poor in the economy and prosperity of the country i

 My dear countrymen, in the last decades we have been experiencing that diseases like corruption and art money have taken root in the country and this corruption, this art money, this Gorakh business is the biggest obstacle in removing poverty from the country
 ek taraf to vishwa main ham aarthik gati main teji se badhane vaale deshon main sabase aage hai
 On the other hand, in the global ranking of corruption two years ago, India was almost number one hundred
 dher saare kadam uthaane ke baavjood ham chhehattaraven number par pahunch paae hai
 This shows how widely the network of corruption and black money has been spread in the country
 bhrashtachar kii beemaari ko kuch varg vishesh ke logon ne apane swaarth ke kaaran failaa rakhaa he
 They themselves have thrived, ignoring the rights of the poor
 kuch logon ne pad kaa durupyog karte hue iskaa bharpoor phayda uthaaya
 On the other hand, sincere people have also fought against it
 desh ke karodon nagarikon ne eemaandaaree ko ji kar ke dikhaaya he
 We often hear about how a poor auto driver returns a bag of gold jewelery left in his car to its rightful owner, and many times we hear that a taxi driver will leave a baggage of passengers, a mobile phone
 If he goes, he goes to search for them with his expenses, and he delivers, hey, the seller of vegetables, even the general store, if he takes more money by mistake than the customer, then call him And returns
 pyaare deshavaasiyon,is baat kaa ye saboot he ki hindustan kaa saamaanya se saamaanya naagarik eemaandaar he, lekin pyaare deshavaasiyon, har desh ke vikaas ke itihaas main aise kshan aaye hai jab ek shaktishaalee or nirnaayak kadam kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kii gai
 This country has realized over the years that corruption, black money, counterfeit notes and terrorism - are the cancers that push the country back in the race for development
 desh ko, samaaj ko andar hi andar khokhla kar detii he
 My dear countrymen, who does not know the horrors of terrorism? How many innocent people are put to death
 lekin kya aapane soncha he kii in aatankiyon ko paisa kahan kahan se muhaiyaa hota he? seemaa paar ke hamaare shatru jaali noton ke jariye, nakli noton ke jariye apana dhandha bharat main chalaate hai or yah saalon se chal rahaa he
 Many times, those who trade fake currency of 500 and thousand rupees have also been caught and these notes have also been seized
 bahanon bhaaiyon,ek taraf aatankwaad or jaali noton kaa jaal desh ko tabah kar rahaa he
 On the other hand, the challenge of corruption and black money remains before the country
 hamane kaary sanbhaalane ke turant baad bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ke khilaaf ladaai kii shuruyaat karte hue anek prabhavi kadam uthaayen, jaise:kaale dhan kii jaanch ke liye supreme court ke purv jaj kii adhyakshata main SIT kaa gathan kiya
 In 2015, we worked to make strong laws for black money stashed abroad, we changed the tax agreements with different countries to bring black money from abroad, new agreements were made with the exchange of information, information exchange with various countries including America
 Provided another strong law in August 2016 to stop the benami property of miscreants
this law closed a very big thief door
 Gone
 desh main aghoshit aay ko penalty ke saath ghoshit karne kii yojana main kaaphi badi maatra main aghoshit aay ujagar hui
 My dear countrymen, due to all these efforts, in the last two and a half years, about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money has come out from the corrupt people
 aise karodon bharatvasi jinke rag rag main eemaandaaree daudti he unka maananaa he ki bhrashtachar, kaale dhan, benami sampatti, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai nirnaayak honi chahie
 Who would be such an honest citizen who does not have to suffer the news that crores of rupees are found in the officers' house under the bed, or in sacks everywhere? The share of 1,000 rupee notes has risen to about 80 to 90 percent
 desh main cash kaa atyadhik cirkulation kaa ek sidhaa sambandh bhrashtachar se he
 The business of cash earned from corruption has a major impact on inflation
 isaki maar garibon ko jhelni padati he
 This directly affects the purchasing power of the poor and middle class
 aapkaa swayan kaa anubhav hoga, jab makaan yaa jameen kharidte vaqt aap se kuch dhan check main lenge or zyaadaatar dhanrashi cash main maangi jaati hogi
 Buying anything for an honest person, buying a house for a middle class person, if he does not have art money, then trouble comes
 cash ke is dhandhe ke kaaran makaan, jameen, ucch shiksha or chikitsa jaisi anek sevaaon or vastuon ke mulya main bahut zyada kritrim vruddhi hoti he, artificial increase hota he
 Whether it is money deposited by corruption or black money, both of them give strength to benami hawala business
 or ham jaanate hai ki hawala kaa upyog aatankiyon ne hathiyaar kii kharid farokht main bhi kiya he
 The impact of black money in elections has been discussed for years
 bahanon bhaaiyon,desh ko bhrashtachar or kaale dhan rupi dimak se mukt karaane ke liye ek or sakht kadam uthaanaa zaruri ho gaya he
 Today midnight i

 The old notes of 500 and 1,000 rupees present with the anti-national and anti-social elements involved in the business of corruption, black money and fake notes will now remain just like a piece of paper
 aise naagarik jo sampatti, mehnat or imaanadaaree se kama rahen hai, unke hiton kii or unke haq kii puri raksha kii jaayegi
 Keep in mind that Rs 100, Rs 50, Rs 20, Rs 10, Rs 5, Rs 2 and Rs 1 notes and all coins are regular and can be used for transactions

 ye kaarobaar jaisaa pehle chalata tha vaisaa hi chalata rahegaa
 Despite all these arrangements, if our honest countrymen suffered, then experience shows that the common citizen of this country is never left behind to sacrifice and suffer for the good of the country
 jab main sunata hoon kii koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene coup aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maan kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one wish that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country
 atah bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main ham log thodi si kathinaayee vah bhi kuch dinon ke liye to jhel hi sakate hai
 i fully believe that every citizen of the country will stand together against corruption in this Mahayagya of purity
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon,diwali ke parv ke baad, ab eemaandaaree ke is utsav main, pramanikta ke is parv main aap bad chadh kar haath bataayen
 i fully believe that all the political parties, political activists, social and educational institutions of the country, including the media, will participate more actively in this great work from all sections of society, including the media, play a positive role and make this work successful
 Will continue to do it
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon,ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hoon, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he kii 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he kii bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, the Reserve Bank has been circulating new high denomination notes from time to time with the consent of the central government
 2014 main reserve bank ne 5,000 or 10,000 rupee ke karency note kaa prastaav sarkaar ko bheja tha jise hamaari sarkaar ne vichaar-vimarsh ke baad asweekaar kar diya tha
 In this entire process, the proposal of a new note of Rs 2,000 has been accepted by the Reserve Bank
 puri tarah se nae taur par dijin kiye gaye 500 rupee or 2,000 rupee ke nae karency note ab cirkulation main laayaa jayega
 In view of the past experiences of the Reserve Bank, the Reserve Bank will make necessary arrangements to ensure that the denomination of high denomination notes is now within a limit
 ant main mere pyaare deshwashiyonmai yah doharaana chahta hoon kii kisi desh ke itihaas main aise kshan aate hai jab har vyakti yah mahasoos karata he kii use bhi us kshan kaa hissaa bananaa he
 He too has to contribute in the national interest, in nation building
 parantu aise kshan har kisi kii jindagi main gine chune hi aate hai
 Today, time is again giving us an opportunity
 har saamaanya naagarik bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note ke khilaaf is mahayajna main , is ladaai main apana yogadan de saktaa he
 The more support you receive in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha
 This thinking is eating our political, social, and administrative life like a termite
 shashan vyavastha kaa koi bhi ang is dimak se achoota nahin he
 From time to time, we have seen that if the general public mind of India has to choose one of corruption and inconvenience of a few days, then it is free, i say, it will not choose the honest citizen of my country, but will never choose corruption
 
 aapse main phir ek baar aahvaan karata hoon kii aaiye jaise aapane diwali ke parv main apane ghar or aas pados kii safai kii, vaise hi safai ke kaam ko aage badhaate hue, ham is mahayajna main apni purnahuti daal kar ise safal banaaiye
 In such a big country, in view of the inconvenience in the Mahaparva of such a big cleanliness, let us celebrate the Diwali of all purity, show the whole world the celebration of this honesty of India, celebrate the festival of authenticity in the whole country so that corruption can be curbed, To crack down on black money, enable the people playing the game of counterfeit notes, so that the money of the country can be used for the poor, every honest citizen should be successful in the country's prosperity
 He could get a fair share, future generations proud to live your life
 main aap sab ke sahyog ke liye puure vishvas ke saath sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ki madad se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf is ladaai ko or aage le janaa chahta hoon
 i am sure that your support, your cooperation will be motivating for future generations
 main phir ek baar aapkaa hriday se aabhaar vyakt karata hoon
 Long live Mother India

 'print or not print what comes to mind, i do not need publicity, if it comes to your mind, then do my negative publicity day and night,' says Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 nitish, shuukravaar ko janata dal united ke ek kaarykram main media par apni bhadaas nikaali
 Nitish is displeased with the media that anyone who speaks against him gets a lot of space, irrespective of whether or not that person knows the 'cab' of politics in Nitish Kumar's words
 haalanki nitish ne kaha ki unhen is baat kii koi chintaa nahin hai kyonki wo jaanate hai ki anaap-shanaap bolkar log apana prachaar bhi karte hai
 In this political program, Nitish said from the stage that we will remain the target of all, but the media gives them more space
 lekin wo in sabaki parvaah nahin karte kyonki jo bihar kii janata hai wo hamaare kaam se kush hokar vot detii hai
 It is clear from Nitish's dictum that he is not happy with the space available to his opponents in the media more than the drag of his government on every issue
 lekin sachaai yah bhi hai ki nitish khud bhi media se sarkari press vijyapti se zyaada kaa sambandh nahin rakhana chaahate jiske kaaran sambandh ab asamaanya ho gayi hai
 At the same time, he also has a big mental problem that those who are next to the Chief Minister of the BJP of the state are engaged in regional discussion on the basis of their advertisement

 ek vakt tha jab ramgopal verma ko vanamen industry mana jaataa tha
 His production company was also named Factory and people associated with this factory, whether Ram Gopal Varma or Dibakar Banerjee, were a box of all possibilities
 chele aage bad gaye or ramgopal verma apane hi formule main funs gaye
 As a result, films like Satya, Company and Sarkar were reduced to films like Ramu Department
 baharhaal, arsa hua raamu kii hindi main koi film aae
 In such a situation, the question arises that apart from tweeting the controversial Ramu, where else are there the masks
 jawaab he, icecream
 Ramgopal Varma made an erotic thriller of this name in Telugu language
 or is 19 sitambar ko ramgopal verma is film kaa sikval icecream2 lekar aa rahe hai
 Ram Gopal Varma is introducing a new actress Navina in bold style through the film 'ice Cream 2'
 film main iske alaava chakravarthi lead role main hai
 a song from the film Kiss Me Everywhere is drawing discussion about its erotic style
 icecream2 kaa gaanaa kis me evarivair Fadnavis resigns as CM and Ajit Pawar as deputy CM - political turmoil will not have any impact on investigation of irrigation scam
 There was a big political upset in Maharashtra on Tuesday
 devendra fadanvis ne soobe ke mukhyamantri or ajit pavaar ne upmukhyamantri pad se istipha de diya
 After Ajit Pawar's resignation, Fadnavis came to the media and announced his resignation as Chief Minister
 is dauraan ajtak samvaadadaata sahil joshi ne fadanvis se sawaal kiya ki ajit pavaar ke khilaaf sinchai ghotaalaa maamle ko aapane bade paimaane par uthaaya tha
 Also said that Ajit Pawar will have to grind the mill in jail, but on Saturday you joined Ajit Pawar and formed a government in the state, then you have given clean to Ajit Pawar? If we were the government, we investigated the irrigation scam case
 ab maamle kii jaanch court kii nigaraanee main ho rahi he
 Political turmoil will have no effect on the matter
 unhone kaha ki jahaan tanjit pavaarke saath sarkaar banane kaa sawaal he, to wo nesanalist congress party (NCP) ke netaa hai or jab hamaare paas spasht bahumat nahin he to unki party ke netaa ke saath milakar sarkaar bananaa hi padataa
 If someone other than Ajit Pawar were the leader of the NCP, we would have formed a government with him
 jabafadanvisase poocha gaya ki kya ajit pavaar ke saath maharashtra main sarkaar banaakar bijepi ne galati kii to unhone sawaal ko taalane kii koshish karte hue kaha ki ajit pavaar ke saath milakar sarkaar bananaa galati thi yaa nahin, yah baad main dekha jayega
 Right now we cannot form a government with NCP and i am resigning from my Chief Minister's post
 aapako bataa den kimaharashtramen 70,000 karod rupee ke sinchai ghotaale main ajit pavaar kaa naam saamne aayaa tha
 When this scandal came to light, Ajit Pawar was handling the irrigation department in the congress-ncp coalition government
 is maamle ko vipaksh main rahane ke dauraan bhartiya janata party, shivasena, aam aadmi party or anya vipakshi dalon ne jorshor se uthaaya tha

 Uttar Pradesh: Many challenges in the SP-BSP alliance, apart from the BJP and the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, the alliance itself is a big challenge for both these parties as the number of disgruntled leaders in both the parties is quite good

 After these visits, Mulayam, who was surrounded by activists, questioned the sp's alliance with Mike Thama and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)
 ve bole, ''mayawati ko aadhi seat kyon de di? party bahut majboot thi, ise apane hi log kamjor kar rahe hai
 We brought the party to the top on our own
 akhilesh ne gathbandhan kar liya or hamase poocha hi nahin
 Mulayam Singh Yadav, who spoke in the budget session of Parliament on February 16 that Narendra Modi will become Prime Minister again, questioned the SP-BSP alliance and indicated that all was not going well within his party

 In the alliance, the SP will contest 37 seats and the BSP on 38 seats
 do seat raibareli or amethi, congress or teen siten rashtriya lokdal (areldi) ke liye chodi gai hai
 Ajit Kumar, a professor at Banaras Hindu University, says, "the biggest challenge before the SP-BSP alliance is to keep the leaders who were preparing for the Lok Sabha elections for the last five years and now their seat went to another party
 is
 aise main sapa or basapa donon partiyon ke saamne apana vot bank ek-duusare ko shift karaane kii kathin chunauti he
 After the bifurcation of 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP, BSP National President Mayawati has given only one out of five Lok Sabha seats in Uttarakhand and only three out of 29 seats in Madhya Pradesh
 akhilesh yadav ke saamne ab pehle se naakhush varisht party netaaon ko basapa ke saath is bemail seat bantwaare kaa auchity samajhane kii bhi chunauti he
 However, sp's National Organization Minister and chief spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary says, "the coordination of seats with BSP has been done keeping in mind mutual agreement and respect
" ''asantulit seat bantwaralakhanu ke taj hotel main 12 janvari ko press conference main mayawati ne basapa or sapa ke 38-38 siton par ladgaye kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Though two seats were left for the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), Akhilesh Yadav later accepted a contest in the Lok Sabha elections leaving 37 seats of the SP quota
 mulaayam singh yadav ke najdiki sapa ke ek vidhaan parishad sadsy kehete hai, ''jo party 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main upi kii 39 loksabhaa seat jeet chuki ho, har baar basapa se adhik loksabhaa siten jiti ho, uskaa agle chunaav main keval 37 siton par laduya samaj se pare he
 The SP may have left its quota seat for the RLD, but the BSP is expected to gain more from it
 areldi ke prabhaav vaali bijanour, nagina, amroha, meerut, saharanpur, gautamabudghnagar, aligarh, agra, fatehpur sikri jaisi pashchimi upi kii siton par basapa chunaav ladegi, jabaki sapa ke khate main areldi ke prabhaav vaali kairana, gajiabad, hathras, sanbhal, muradabad siten hi ai hai
 Of the total 37 seats in the sp's share, 19 are those on which the BJP got more votes than the total votes the SP and BSP got in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 vahiin basapa ke khate main aisi keval 14 siten hi hai (dekhen graphics)
 Not only this, SP, which won 5 seats in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, was second on 31 but BSP will contest in 11 of these seats, while BSP was second on 34 seats and out of these only 8 seats of SP
 (see graphics), of course, sp's strength can be more beneficial to BSP, while SP is also behind in this case

 As soon as the BSP of Akbarpur was aware of going to the court, Beria joined Mulayam Singh's younger brother Shivpal Yadav's newly formed Progressive Samajwadi Party (lohia) (PSPL)
 beria kehete hai, ''seat bantwaare se sapa ke varisht netaa kshubdh hai or inamen se kai cycle kaa saath chhod sakate hai

 Shivpal Yadav says, "akhilesh's politics has brought SP on the road
 ''sapa ke puraane netaaon ko apni party main jagah dekar shivpal yadav ne gathbandhan ke saamne khuli chunauti pesh kar di he
 Shivpal Yadav made leaders like former SP MLA Pramod Gupta, former SP MLA Raghuraj Singh Shakya, former MLA Manik Chandra Yadav, six-time MLA elected former minister Kamal Yusuf Malik, relatives of sp's mentor Mulayam Singh Yadav's wife
 Has also turned the quarrel in the political battle
 shivpal lagaataar yadav bahul siton par sabhaayen or baithken kar puraane sapa netaaon se sampark saadh rahe hai
 In the meetings, they accuse Akhilesh Yadav of ignoring Mulayam Singh Yadav and favoring Yadav voters in favor of Mayawati who tortured the BSP government

 SP spokesman Abdul Hafeez Gandhi says, "only leaders who have lost their socialist ideology are leaving SP and moving to other parties
" inke jane se sapa or basapa gathbandhan or majboot ho rahaa he
 Dissatisfaction in the BSP After the seat-sharing with the SP, dissatisfaction has also started emerging in the BSP
 manjhwa se teen baar vidhayak rahe ramesh bind aglaa loksabhaa chunaav basapa ke tikat par mirzapur se ladgaye kii taiyaari kar rahe the

 Even though behind this logic, Maharishi can give the example of Valmiki, who is said to have been a bandit, later changed the course of life with sannyas and wrote Ramayana

 pakistan kii swat ghati main jari ladaai ab apane aakhri daur main pahunch gai he
 The Pakistan Army has started a campaign against militants in Mingora, the main city of Swat
 pakistan fouj ne mingora main apane abhiyaan main 17 aatankiyo ko maar giraane kaa daawa kiya he
 According to Pak army, after the terrorists are eliminated in Mingora, the Swat Valley will be freed from the terrorists in a way
 is bich pakistan main ab ye bahes chal padi he ki paak fouj ko ab wajiristaan main talibani aatankiyon ke khilaaf karrwai kerani chahie yaa nahin

 yah to baccha-baccha jaanata he ki ramayana kii nayika devi sita kaa apharan ravan ne kiya tha, lekin gujarat ke skulon main kaksha 12veen ke chaatro ko ramayana ke bare main kuch or hi padhaayaa ja rahaa he
 In fact, a major mistake has been made in the 12th book of Sanskrit in Gujarat, which changed the story of Ramayana
 kitaab main sita kaa apharan karne vaale kaa naam ravan nahin ram bataaya gaya he
 It is written in the book - 'ram had kidnapped Sita'
 bataa den ki 'introdection tu sanskrit language' naamak is kitaab ke 106 number pej par iskaa zikr he
 This is a mistake that even a child can catch
 is kitaab main jahaan likhaa hona chahie tha ki ravan ne sita kaa apharan kiya
 According to the paragraph written in this book, 'the Father of Terrorism' told Bal Gangadhar Tilak in the book of Rajasthan, 'here the poet has taken the best picture of Ram's character with his original thinking and thought
 ram dwaara sita kaa apharan kar liye jane ke baad lakshmana dwaara ram ko die gaye sandesh kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 This mistake is only in the English medium books
 sanskrit ke mahaan kavi kalidas kii rachana 'raghuvansham' par aadhaarit paath main gujarati kitabon main yah galati nahin he
 This paragraph is written correctly in it
 HSSC pariksha main poocha- kaala brahman apshagun yaa brahman kii kanya?dilachasp yah he ki yah kitaab 2017 ke silebus main thi or ek saal tak chaatro ne is kitaab se padhaa he
 At the same time, the textbook board says that, as soon as this information came to our knowledge, it was rectified in soft copy on the Internet
 turant hi sabhi skulon ke principal or teachers ko isaki jaankaree de di gai
 Significantly, for the last one year in Gujarat, students are studying Sanskrit subject with the same mistake in Gujarat, but in the last one year no school teacher has even informed the textbook board
 aapako bataa den ki kitabon main galati kaa yah pehla maamla nahin he
 There have been many cases before this as well
 rajasthan ke skulon main 8veen main padhai jane vaali angreji kii saamaajik vigyaan kii kitaab main swatantraaa sangram senaanee bal gangadhar tilak ko 'aatank kaa janak' (fadar of terarysm) bataaya gaya tha

 The Congress is ready to support the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the event of a hung assembly in the upcoming Delhi elections

 However, the Aam Aadmi Party immediately turned down this potential offer
 shila dikshit ne kaha, 'tark to yahi kahata he ki ham sthir sarkaar hi chahenge
 So if the need arises, we will give preference to the AAP to keep the communal forces away from power

 sabase badi baat film kii starcast
 The film stars Ranveer and Sara
 ranvir bollywood main nai peedi ke sabase bade star hai
 Recently, Deepika is ringing with Ranveer for her marriage to Padukone and for various reasons

 Aggressive publicity and all things are seen in favor of Simba in terms of Simba box office
 is shuukravaar se box offis par superstars kii filmon ke bich jari jang ko dekhnaa dilachasp hoga

 haryana sarkaar mazdooron ko riyayati dar par khaanaa muhaiyaa karaayegi
 The Khattar government of Haryana said on Friday that under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana, it has decided to open a canteen at 23 places in the state for giving subsidized food to registered construction laborers

 unhone kaha ki in canteen main subah aath baje se dopaher do baje tak bhojan parosa jayega or bhojan kii gunvattta par vibhaag vishesh dhyaan degaa
 Let us know that many states of the country have started schemes to provide food to people at affordable rates in recent times
 inamen uttar pradesh, rajasthan, punjab jaise bade rajya bhi shaamil hai
 In UP, Yogi Sarkar of BJP has started a plan to provide breakfast for 3 rupees and food for five rupees

 shaks ne ek trick se atm (ATM) se lakhon rupee nikaal liye
 Haresh Patel, hailing from Surat (surat), took a trick with 1 at the ATM
 54 lakh rupee nikaal liye
 When the bank caught this trick, they were also surprised
 vah ungali ke jariye atm se paise nikaalata tha
 His record was not in the account
 timesofindia kii khabar ke mutabik, surat ke utaran kii rahane vaale haresh patel ko union bank of india ke manager kii shikaayat ke baad hiraasat main liya gaya
 Union Bank of India manager Anoop Singh had lodged a complaint at Chandrakheda police station
 jiske baad kaarywahi kii gai
 Manager Anoop told that when i was counting the rupees and the withdrawn rupees in the evening, something was wrong
 kuch match nahin ho rahaa tha
 When i checked the records, a customer was suspicious
 haresh patel kaa acount ubiai ke haripura branch main he
 From July to November Harish Patel had been complaining that the money he is trying to withdraw is not coming out
 wo us vakt 9 se 15 hajaar rupee tak nikaala karata tha
 So that no one is suspicious
 patel ne bank ko bataaya ki jab bhi wo paise nikaalane jaataa he to wo nikalate nahin he
 He told about the mess of ATM
 lekin jab ejeeniyar check karne pahunche to sabakuch thik tha
 When the bank officials checked the CCTV, their senses flew away
 sab inspector viaar desai ne bataaya ki haresh patel- 'paise nikaalte vakt cash dispencer trey main ungali fansaa letaa tha
 As soon as the money arrived, he used to block the tray
 aise main agar paise nikaal lete hai to slip par tranjection fail bataata tha or acount se paise nahin katate the
 In such a situation, he used to go to the bank with a slip and filed a complaint
 ' sab inspector desai ne kaha- ''ye trick pehle bhi kai gang kar chuki he

 Before Independence Day, the Ministry of Home Affairs has issued an alert about this
 alert ke mutabik, pakistani khufia agency ISI aisi yojana bana rahi he
 The alert also states that some Lashkar terrorists are planning attacks in some cities in India

 In a letter sent to all forces and the state police, the Ministry has also informed about the active involvement of al-qaeda in planning an attack on India's naval bases
 alert main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki lashkar ke kuch aatanki bharat ke kuch shaharon main hamale kii yojana bana rahe hai
 On the lines of 26 / 11, these terrorists coming to India via sea route from Karachi or through Jammu and Kashmir can target railway stations or hotels
 alert ke mutabik, bijepi daftar ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, there can be crowded areas of the states on the target of terrorists

 The killing of over 130 school children in Peshawar by the Taliban terrorists on December 16 has shaken Pakistan badly
 isse puri duniya sann rah gai
 This incident, however, is not the first instance of the brutality of the jihadis, but it is a witness to its attrition
 pichley kuch varshon ke dauraan pakistan main paley-bade aatankwaadiyon ne shiya or ahmadi masjidon, sunni dargahon, charchon or hindu mandiron par bam giraae hai
 The Taliban have carried out more than a thousand attacks on schools since 2009, mostly in the northwestern Pakhtunkhwa province
 in varshon main jihadiyon ke nishane par kai shaharon main iesai ke daftar, karachi or kamra main nausena or vaayu sena ke adde, karachi antarrashtriya hawaii adda or yahaan tak ki fouj kaa mukhyalay bhi rahe hai
 Even if terror attacks on such a large scale have not erased Pakistan's desire to check her jihadis, is it to be believed that the killing of innocent people in Peshawar school and the burning of teachers alive will change her mind? Immediately after, Maulana Abdul Aziz of Ku Khyat Lal Mosque in Islamabad refused to condemn the Taliban's actions, which led to the jihadis' And inertia is exposed
 taliban se sahanubhuti rakhane vaale imran khan ne hamalaavaron kaa naam liye bagaiyr golmol shabdon main hamale kii ninda kii
 Hafiz Mohammed Saeed of lashkar-e-taiba / jamaat-ud-dawa, another favorite of Pakistani rulers, blamed India for the Taliban attack on TV and vowed to avenge it
 pakistan main jehadi vichaar kii jaden darasal vahaan satta-pratishthan main bharat virdohi junun main rachi-basii hai jiskaa pichhlaa sira vibhaajan, do rashtron ke siddhant or is dar main atka hua he ki taqatvar desh pakistan ko toduya chaahate hai
 This craze has been strengthened by the breakdown of Pakistan in 1971 and the formation of Bangladesh
 iske badale desh kaa abhijatya punjabi tabaka yah samaj paata to behatar hota ki pakistan ke aakaar or uski takat ke hisaab se kaise hakeekat kii jameen par desh ko mahfuj karnaa he
 Pakistan's existence has been established on the basis of religion and ideology instead of its ethnic, linguistic and community diversity
 natijatan, rashtriya suraksha ko lekar desh kaa najariya vyaavhaarik kii bajaae majahabi or vichaardhaara se prerit he
 Although Pakistan's military and civil bureaucracy was established in the British Raj itself, its attitude and attitude have been dictated by "pakistan's religious existence" much more
 ve peshevraana tareeke amuman faisle lene main kaam nahin aate, jinka mujahiraa vah aksar bahriyon ke saamne karata he
 The relationship between Pakistan and Jihadi thought cannot be understood unless you understand the basic aspect of this country
 pakistan kaa rashtriya aakhyaan, rashtriya tanabana or rashtriya pahchaan sab kuch islam ke ird-gird hi nirmit he
 During the first 30 years of Pakistan's birth there was talk of domestic policy on a religious basis and foreign policy in the pan-islamic realm
 phir, baaki 30 barason main vaishvik jehadi vichaar hi yahaan kii suraksha or videsh niti kaa aadhaar rahaa he
 The three commanders of the Pakistani army, General Pervez Musharraf, General Ashfaq Kayani and General Rahil Sharif, have tried to reduce the jihadi influence within Pakistan, which has also resorted to military operations, but their efforts are based on the basic beliefs of the country
 Moving has always been incomplete
 pakistan ke vichaar or use jaij tehraane ke liye vahaan ke skulon main padhaaye jane vaale jhuthe itihaas ne samaaj main shariya, islamic khilaafat or islamic rajya ke prati sahanubhuti paidaa kii he
 This idea works in favor of more than 33 terror groups who are within Pakistan
 pakistan ke hukmaranon ke liye kshetreey jihadiyon kaa samarthan karte hue vaishvik aatankiyon or sthaneey jihadiyon ko khatm karne main koi pareshaani nahin hoti, lekin aam log jehadi guton ke prati alag najariya rakhte hai
 The unfortunate fact is that those who want to end the tehreek-e-taliban Pakistan, their own opinion against the Sharia and Western values, are hampered by this, as it matches the supporters of other jihadi groups, regardless of their methods
 Common people hate
 adhiktar deshon ke liye parmaanu hathiyaar un par hamale ke khilaaf antim guarantee hai lekin ‘‘pakistan ke buniyadi vichaar’’ ke himytiyon ke liye suraksha hi paryaapt nahin he
 Within the theory of two nations, there is a kind of comparison between Muslim Pakistan and Hindu India
 pichley 67 varsh kii ghatnaon ne dvirashtra ke siddhant ko apraasangik kar diya he
 Today, the number of Muslims living in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh is roughly equal and the number of Muslims living outside Pakistan in this subcontinent is more than in Pakistan
 lekin pakistan kii mul avadharana is shart kii maang karti he ki vah muslim rashtriyata ke daayitv kaa paalan kare or bharat kii barabari kare
 The problem is that the size of Pakistan and its economy does not allow it to do so even though India is much larger and is continuously thriving
 iske alaava sheet yuddh ke daur main pakistan ko pashchim, khaskar america kii shah se mili takat bhi ab nahin rah gai he
 This is the reason why Pakistani rulers have no other strategic option than to wage a proxy war through the jihadis
 doosraa rasta yah hota ki desh kii aabaadi ke liye suraksha or sampannataa kaa kaam kiya jaataa, lekin islamabad main hukmaranon ne is par khaas gaur nahin kiya he
 The pressure of the Qommi perspective, in spite of many painful incidents like the recent Peshawar incident, still appeals to Pakistanis the basic idea of pakistan
 1947 main desh ko thode sansaadhan hi mili the or vah shuruyaat se hi sankat main tha
 The riots during the partition and the incident of the departure of Jammu and Kashmir severely injured the generation that laid the foundation of Pakistan
 desh isliye bachaa rahaa kyonki yahaan ke logon main dhairya tha or hukmaranon ne sheet yuddh ke daur ke halaat kaa istemaal kiya
 Pakistan made the first military ascent in Kashmir in 1948 which included Lashkar from the tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan
 in ladaakon ne pakistani fouj kii takat badha di thi
 The reason for putting the tribals on the jihad in Kashmir along the Indus was hidden in the sense that they should not join the struggle for the demand of Pakhtistan, which was being advocated by Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and the government of Afghanistan at the time
 is tarah pakistan main kaumi nazariye se bandhe gaiyr-sarkari hathiyaarband guton ke prati hamadardi paidaa hui, jo faujee hukmaranon kii ranneetiyon kii mafik apni gatividhiyaan banaae rakhte the
 This policy of Pakistan got a sudden boost in the eighties when the US decided to support the Mujahideen in Afghanistan to counter the Soviet Union
 baari maatra main hathiyaaron, paison or ladaakon kii aamad hone lagi or pakistan ke faujee hukmaranon ne na sirf afghanistan balki jammu-kashmir main bhi ladgaye ke liye ladaakuon ke prashikshan shivi lagane shuru kar die
 Today it is the result of this that all terrorist organizations are working from Pakistan and they have found safe havens in cities and villages
 inamen kuch sipah-e-sahaba jaise muslim sampradaayon or dharmik alpsankhyakon ko nishaanaa banaate hai, lashkar-e-taiyaba or jaish-e-mohammad jaise bharat virdohi sanghathan hai, afghanistan virdohi mullah umr kaa taliban or hakkaani network he jabaki khud pakistani fouj ke khilaaf jang main mubtila taharik-e-taliban pakistan he
 The first turning point in the nature of terrorism in Pakistan came from the 9 / 11 attack and subsequent US incursions on Afghanistan
 general musharraf ne kaaphi teji se kabul kii taliban sarkaar ke saath apane rishte tod liye or vahaan america sainya abhiyaan ko samarthan de diya
 In order to carry forward the process of restoring peace with India, he put some curb on terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir
 april 1999 main musharraf ne avkaash praapt sainya afasaron ke ek samooh se kaha tha, ‘‘taliban meraa ranneetik khajaana he or main jab chaahun, unhen dasiyon hajaar kii sankhya main bharat ke khilaaf khulaa chhod saktaa hum
 By 2002, their tone had changed and they imposed minor restrictions on groups like lashkar-e-taiba, but these banned organizations and their leaders were allowed to work under new names
 musharraf ke maatahat pakistan ne jehadi guton ke bich fark baratna shuru kar diya tha
 While foreign terrorists with ties to al-qaeda were handed over to the US, local and regional terrorists (fundamentalists, anti-india and Afghan opponents) were left open
 kuch aatankiyon ne pakistani fouj kii naak ke neeche sarkari adeshon ko chunauti dene kii kshamta viksit kar lee thi
 They have caused heavy losses to security forces in Pakistan and Afghanistan over the years
 hakkaani network jaise anya guton kaa ‘‘prabandh’’ pakistani guptchar agenciyaan karti thim taaki afghanistan kii gatividhiyon par asar daalaa ja sake
 The current policy of increasing domestic terrorism in Pakistan is the result of the same policy
 desh bhale hi aatankiyon main fark barat le lekin jehadi mote taur par ek-duusare ke saath sahyog or sahanubhuti rakhte hai
 It is in this way that the jihadis, backed by the establishment, end up supporting the terrorists who are targeting the Pakistani army and the common people
 vichaardhaara prerit aatankiyon ke maamle main aksar hota he ki ranneeti ke upar siddhant baari pad jaataa he or jahaan tak jihadiyon kaa maamla he, jinhen pakistani sarkaar kaa samarthan mil rahaa he, ve bhi un ladaakon kaa mol samajhate hai jo desh ko zyada islamic banane kii disha main sakriy hai
 According to the South Asian Terrorism Portal, between 2003 and 2014, 19,152 civilians and 5,839 security personnel have lost their lives in terrorist attacks
 isamen peshawar ke haalia hamale main maare gaye bachche shaamil nahin hai
 Pakistan's allegiance to Islam-based Qaumi unity has helped radical factions to spread them and raise huge sums of money without much hitch
 iske alaava, sainya or guptchar pranali to majboot rahi he lekin sthaneey police ko kabhi bhi siyaasi madad, sansaadhan or prashikshan muhaiyaa nahin karaae gaye jisase vah in aatanki samoohon se lard paane main sakasham hoti
 The result of poor training and poor morale police force is that some organizations run kidnapping and extortion business in urban centers
 iske alaava ve maadak padaarthon kii taskari or taskari ke saamaan ke vyapaar se bhi paisa jutate hai
 In this way, terrorist organizations have a systematic system of raising money for their activities, so that they will continue to work even when the country takes the final decision to eliminate them
 philhal aisa faisla naammumkin dikhataa he
 Pakistan has been living like an ostrich for years
 barason tak vah afgaan taliban ko samarthan yaa kashmiri jehadi prashikshan shiviron ke hone se inkaar karata rahaa
 The existence of al Qaeda leaders, including Osama bin Laden, was cited as the result of Pakistan's involvement in anti-russia jihad in the eighties
 inkaar se haalanki aage kaa rasta nahin banataa
 Pakistan's Islam-based nationalism has nurtured bigotry, reduced economic growth and discounted its international credibility
 ham ab tak yah nahin jaanate ki pakistani kii fouj ke bheetar kis had tak vichaardhaara ne send lagaai he, jo ki desh kii sabase majboot sansthaaon main ek he
 (jamaat-ud-dawa leader Hafiz Saeed's rally in Islamabad in May) Failed state-mechanisms are examples of when military officers, non-commissioned officers and military allies have supported jihadis or jihadist groups leaving military jobs Has joined
 pakistani satta pratishthan is maamle se judi suchanaaen gopneey rakhata he jiske chalate is samasya kaa koi bhi akalan kathin ho jaataa he
 The attack on Pakistan's naval base Mehran in 2011, the 2012 attack on the Air Force base Kamra and the failed attempt of Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) to capture a naval vessel at Karachi Harbor in 2014 indicate that Jihadi influence persists within the armed forces
 america or nato balon kii afghanistan se vaapasi ke alok main yah sambhaavna kam he ki pakistani satta pratishthan afghanistan ke upar apni sarvocch satta kaayam karne kii dashakon kii mehnat ko aise hi jane de
 Pakistan has cleared known jihadist bases in North Waziristan in view of international pressures and the increasing challenges of the Taliban on the domestic front
 isse hakkaani network jaise afgani gut apane mukhyalay se maharoom ho gaye hai
 Pakistan, however, never took any action against the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network is believed to have established its headquarters in other areas in Fata
 nikat bhavishya main pakistan kii niti yah hogi ki afghanistan or america sarkaar ke saath samvaad kii prakriya chalaai jaae jiskaa ghoshit uddeshy taliban ke saath kisi samjhaute par pahunchnaa ho
 Parallel to this, it is possible that he will try to change the ground situation in Afghanistan by military methods so that he can force the world to clear the Taliban's actual occupied Afghan areas
 islamabad ke nazariye se aisa karke vah afghanistan par samjhaute kii aakhri sharton ko apane hisaab se tay kar paane main samarth hoga jisase ek to bharat kii vahaan se vaapasi ho jaaegi or duusare, uske uttar-pashchimi padosiyon ke pakistani prabhutv main hone par muhar lag jaaegi
 Now the question arises that is it practical for Pakistan to imagine competing with India and dominating Afghanistan? In the last 67 years, only military establishment was strengthened in Pakistan
 skulon se lekar vishvavidhyalay or nyaaypalika tak desh kii tamaam sansthaaen amuman patan kii ore hi ja rahi hai
 Whatever growth is taking place in the decaying economy is largely dependent on the inflow of concessional flow of external resources
 pakistan kaa vishudgh sakal gharelu utpaada 245 arab dollar he jabaki kray shakti (pipipi) ke sandarbh main 845 arab dollar he
 It is the smallest economy among all countries with atomic strength
 yahaan kii 22 fisadi aabaadi garibi rekha ke neeche rahati he jabaki 21 fisadi bamushkil uske upar he, jiskaa matlab yah hua ki pakistan kii kareeb aadhi aabaadi bahut garib he
 There is hardly any relief from being told to such poor that there is more poverty in neighboring India or Afghanistan
 aazaadee ke vakt pakistan kii 16
 4 per cent of the population was literate, whereas in India, this figure was 18
 3 fisadi tha
 India till 2011 74
 04 fisadi sakshartaa dar praapt kar lee thi jabaki pakistan main yah 57 fisadi par thi
 The two per cent difference in literacy rate between the two increased to 20 per cent in 67 years
 pakistan ne 2009 main shiksha ke liye apane bajet kaa 2
 7 per cent was allotted — where the period of time the children stay in school is seven years
 paanch se 15 saal ke bich skool jane kii umr vaale 38 fisadi bachche yahaan skulon se baahar hai
 The population of Pakistan is between 18 to 19 crores with 60% working population which is between 15-64 years while 35% population is up to 14 years
 is maamle main pakistan ko apni aabaadi kaa laabh mil saktaa he lekin yah duswapn bhi sabit ho saktaa he
 Pakistan's technological base is also limited due to low literacy rate and insufficient investment in education which prevents economic modernization
 desh kaa ahm udyog kapadaa he lekin bada kapaas utpaadak desh hone ke baavjood pakistan mulya-sanvardhit kapadaa utpaadon ke bazaar main apni khaas jagah nahin bana paaya he
 a tax and GDP ratio of around nine per cent puts Pakistan among the last countries in this case and 1
 7-2
 1 with a GDP growth rate of between 4 per cent
 5 fisadi kii jansankhya vruddhi dar is baat kii taakid karti he ki pakistan ko sthaneey kanoonon main teevr badlaav karne ke saath gharelu or videshi donon hi kism ke nivesh kii jarurat he
 All this will require extensive political consensus and stability, which is presently absent
 pakistan kii kareeb 40 fisadi aabaadi shahari he or sarkaar kul 2
 6 per cent spends on public health services
 natijatan saamaajik sevaaon main bhi giravat kaa rukh he
 On the other hand, Pakistan spends around six per cent of its GDP on defense, yet it is unable to match India's traditional military force which has achieved three times its strength by spending less than three per cent of GDP on defense
 pichley kai dashakon main pakistan lagaataar sankaton or naakaamiyon se isliye bal-bal batch jaataa rahaa he kyonki antarrashtriya samudaay use bachaa letaa rahaa he
 Today, the rest of the world sees Pakistan as the center of Jihad
 yahaan ke kabaili ilaakon main maujuud prashikshan shiviron se nikalakar aatanki allaah ke naam par duniya ke alag-alag ilaakon main ladgaye gaye hai
 There have been reports of foreign fighters who have been trained in Pakistan from Syria, Iraq, Somalia, Mali, Nigeria and Xinjiang areas of China
 ab yah mumkin nahin rah gaya he ki sirf bharat ko nuksaan pahunchane ke vaaste pakistan in jihadiyon ko apni ranneetik takat ke rup main bachaae rakh sake
 Rather than being at par with India and dominating Afghanistan, the jihadis have deepened the internal crisis and turmoil within Pakistan
 ho saktaa he ki yah faisla uske liye kaaphi kadaa ho, lekin pakistan ko is chhadam jang ke raste kshetreey prabhutv kaayam karne ke apane uddeshy kii baari keemat chukaani hogi
 It is suicidal to embrace others while fighting some jihadis

 It is time to revert to the views of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Hussein Shaheed Suhrawardy of Bengal who opposed the "idea of pakistan"
 suhravardi ne march 1948 main pakistan kii samvidhan sabha ko khatre main islam kii avadharana ke ird-gird pakistani rashtrawaad ko gande se aagaah kiya tha
 According to him, the slogan given to unite the Muslims for the formation of Pakistan, there was no need after independence
 unhone kaha tha, ‘‘aap khatre main pakistan kaa hallaa isliye machaa rahe hai taaki musalamaanon kii bhaawanaaon ko bhadakaayaa ja sake or unhen ekajute rakhaa ja sake taaki aap satta main bane rah saken
 "suhrawardy warned against turning Pakistan into a state" based on Islam in peril or Pakistan's sense of danger "
 unhone sthapana di thi ki ‘‘ek aisa rajya jo hamalon kaa hauva khadaa karke’’ dushmano ke saath ‘‘ragad-jhagad’’ ke naam par ‘‘jode rakhaa jayega

 If Pakistan's rulers really want to take a decisive step at this juncture, they will have to stop calling Pakistan's jihad-adversaries an enemy and gradually embrace a new national narrative for the country

 The crisis within the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in Goa is unprecedented
 sangh ke 90 saal ke itihaas main aisa pehle kabhi nahin hua ki vibhaag sangh chaalak ko daayitvamukt karne ke baad samoochee ikai ne swatantra hone kaa elaan kar diya ho or ek duusare aanushanbik sanghathan (bijepi) ke viruddh kaam kar use chunaav main parajeet karne kii saarvajanik chunauti de daali ho
 This has happened in Goa
 vibhaag sangh chaalak subhash weylingkar ko mangalvaar ko daayitvamukt kiya gaya or uske agle hi din sangh ke saikadon kaaryakartaaon or padaadhikariyon ne swayan ko alag kar liya
 The situation reached such a point that the RSS had to issue a statement on the situation in Goa for the second time within twenty four hours

 Such situations have happened in the Sangh even before, but the matter did not break down
 jammu-kashmir main 2002 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sangh ke varisht padaadhikariyon ne ek alag raajnneetik manch ko samarthan diya tha
 The BJP also suffered damage due to this in Hindu-majority Jammu
 isi tarah gujarat main keshubhai patel kii baghaavat ko sangh ke ek varisht padaadhikari kaa samarthan tha, lekin vah baghaavat phuss ho gai thi

 However, to the satisfaction of being called to Delhi from Karnataka, some leaders of the state BJP say that their interference in the affairs there is intact, because they are supporting such leaders who do not want the party to declare BS Yeddyurappa as the Chief Ministerial candidate

 sangh ne aisi shikayaton ke bich rajyon ke sanghathan mantriyon or sahamantriyon kii isi maheene baithak bulaane kaa faisla kiya he

 But this time the importance of this meeting has increased in view of Goa's case
 baithak main sangh mahasachiv bhaiyaji joshi bhi maujuud rahenge
 It is believed that the volunteers of the Sangh can be advised to be careful on the slippery path of politics, so that the growing political ambitions of the Sangh leaders can be curbed
 goa main aisa hi hua he
 On Tuesday, Subhash Welingkar, the department's union driver, was relieved and the next day hundreds of Sangh workers and officials separated themselves

 There is currently no way for the RSS to stop this rebellion
 sangh ne yah jarur kaha he ki goa vibhaag ke padaadhikariyon ke naamon kaa elaan jald hi kar diya jayega, lekin weylingkar ke saath gaye sainkadon sangh kaaryakartaaon ko waapas laane ke liye kya kadam uthaae ja rahe hai, is bare main sangh filhal kuch bolne ko taiyaar nahin
 However, the opposition parties are calling it a no-wrestle between the RSS and the BJP
 congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne twitor par poocha he ki kya yah donon ke bich nura-kushti nahin he
 
 
 The Some political analysts believe that this rebellion can also be the result of mutual understanding, so that the anti-bjp votes can be prevented from entering the Congress and the fast-moving Aam Aadmi Party
 sangh main aise halaat pehle bhi bane hai, magar baat tut tak nahin pahunchi
 In the 2002 assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, a separate political platform was supported by senior RSS officials
 bijepi ko hindu-bahul jammu main isaki vajah se nuqasaan bhi pahunchaa tha
 Similarly, the rebellion of Keshubhai Patel in Gujarat was supported by a senior Sangh functionary, but that rebellion got entangled
 tippaniyan The other problem confronting the Sangh is the increasing political ambitions of the campaigners sent to the BJP
 in netaaon ko bijepi main sanghathan mantri or sanghathan sahamantri kii zimmedaari di jaati he
 State units are constantly receiving complaints of their interference

 The union has decided to call a meeting of state organization ministers and co-ministers this month amid such complaints
 dilli se sate surajkund main teen din kii yah baithak 10 sitambar se shuru hogi
 However, union leaders say that such meetings take place every year in august-september
 magar goa ke maamle ko dekhte hue is baar is baithak kaa mahatv bad gaya he
 Sangh general secretary Bhaiyaji Joshi will also be present in the meeting
 mana ja rahaa he ki sangh ke swayamsevakon ko raajnneeti kii phislan bhari raah par sanbhalkar chalane kii naseehat di ja sakati he, taaki sangh netaaon kii badhati raajnneetik mahatvakankshaon par lagaam kasi ja sake
