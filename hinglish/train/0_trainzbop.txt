 Coal is the single largest fuel for more than half of the energy used in India, which produces two-thirds of the electricity we need
 phir bhi ek tihaai aabaadi bijli se vanchit he or baaki bhi uski aankh michauli se pareshaan rahati he
 This is directly related to the current c deficit or current account deficit

 India's coal reserves are ranked fourth in the world, yet why do we import coal? Searching the world markets for fuel imports, we often encounter the third c ie China

 India burns coal with 45 per cent ash content and is directly confronted with the fourth c ie climate wall
 vahaan yah maang jor pakad rahi he ki china or bharat nirmal tareeke apanaaen
 With the unprecedented cover of carbon emissions in the world, China has built the largest coal burning capacity in the world in the two decades following the Rio Summit

 India's strategy to hold on to China is not going to benefit for long
 isi tarah america main shell gas kii dhooma machane se america atlantic ke paar jalwaayu ko badalane se rokane ke liye zyada aakraamak tevar dikhayega

 On Thursday, people started gathering for the Rath Yatra of Akhilesh Yadav at the Law Martinier Ground in Lucknow
 lekin sabaki nigahen is baat par lagi thi ki rath yatra ko jhandi dikhaane ke liye mulaayam singh yadav or shivpal yadav aate hai yaa nahin
 The schedule of the event was fixed at 9:00 pm, but around 10:00 pm the first Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav came on stage
 tab tak maidan khachaakhach bhar chukaa tha
 Akhilesh Yadav had been raising slogans of Zindabad that Mulayam Singh and Shivpal Yadav reached together
 akhilesh yadav ne raahat kii saans lee
 All the ministers of his cabinet were already present on the stage
 yahi nahin wo purv mantri bhi maujuud the jinhen akhilesh yadav ne barkhaast kar diya he
 Similarly, the leaders of Akhilesh Yadav were also present on the stage, which Shivpal Yadav has dropped out of the party
 lekin samaajawaadee party main mache ghamaasan ke bich in logon kaa saath aana sirf dikhaane ke liye tha
 As soon as these leaders started speaking, it became clear that the crack was not erased
 shivpal yadav manch par kaaphi asahaj dikh rahe the kyonki vahaan maujuudbhidsirf akhilesh ke samarthakon kii thi or naare bhi unheen ke lag rahe the
 Akhilesh Yadav's wife Dimple Yadav and children also came on stage
 apane chote se bhaashan main shivpal yadav ne akhilesh ko shubhakamanaayen to di, lekin dobaaraa mukhyamantri banane ke liye akhilesh yadav kaa naam lene ke bajaae phir se samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar banane kii baat kahi
 Even when Shivpal Yadav was speaking, the slogans of Akhilesh Zindabad were being raised
 akhilesh bhi bade gaur se sun rahe the ki chachaa kahin koi gul na khilaa den
 But Shivpal Yadav sat in his chair after a short speech
 akhilesh yadav jab bolne ke liye uthe to tamaam netaaon kaa naam sambodhan main liya
 But instead of taking the name of uncle Shivpal, he did the work by simply calling him the state president
 akhilesh yadav ne samarthakon se kaha ki unka rath maheene bhar pehle nikalnaa tha lekin kuch shadyantr kii vajah se kadam kuch ladkadaa gaye hai
 Akhilesh expressed confidence about returning to power on the strength of his government
 jab mulaayam singh yadav bolne ko uthe to akhilesh yadav khaase nervas dikh rahe the
 Mulayam Singh has dragged Akhilesh badly from many such public forums and Akhilesh Yadav was afraid that even today Netaji may break the color
 mulaayam singh yadav ne apane bhaashan kaa zyaada hissaa akhilesh yadav yaa unki sarkaar ke bajaay bharat pakistan ke rishte or seemaa par ho rahe sangharsh ko samarpit kiya
 Mulayam Singh said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should visit the families of the martyrs
 isi bich ab akhilesh yadav ke samarthakon ne naare lagane shuru kiye to mulaayam singh yadav ne fouran daant lagaai or kaha ki naare lagane vaale lathi chalaate samay gaayab ho jate hai
 Akhilesh Yadav kept listening silently when Mulayam Singh said that this party was formed because of people who ate lathi and stood in front of police baton
 lekin jis hytech rath ko lekar itnaa kuch kaha gaya tha vah safar shuru hote hi kharaab ho gaya or akhilesh yadav ko aage kii yatra apni gaadi main kerani padi

 There are no professors in this university
 shiksha kii mali haalat aap dekh hi rahe hai
 Rules say that probation should end after two years
 lekin jin sahaayak praadhyaapakon ne nirdhaarit maapdand puure kar liye, 13 saal baad bhi unka probeshan kaa period khatm nahin hua
 Many leaders who have raised the caste flag will be found for them
 lekin haqiqat main kai saal se ye apni ladaai khud hi lard rahe hai
 There are three rules for recruitment in Higher Education Department in Madhya Pradesh
 pehla - bhartee niyam 1967, doosraa - bhartee niyam 1990 or teesraa - bhartee niyam 2016
 In Madhya Pradesh Higher Education Department, about two and a half thousand assistant professors are adhoc
 ye 1984 se 1990 kii avadhi ke hai or balldor entry vaale hai
 The Recruitment Rules 1967 was in force at the time of his appointment, in which there was no such term as adhoc appointment
 yani is tarah kii niyuktiyaan niyam viruddh thim
 To justify these appointments, the government first made the Recruitment Rules 1990 and then relaxed everyone by age and educational qualifications
 backlog niyuktiyon ke liye 2003 main madhyapradesh lokseva ayog ne sahaayak praadhyaapak padon ke liye vigyaapan jari kiya jisamen NET / SLET / Ph
 D
 kii shart thi
 The candidates belonging to the Scheduled Caste / Tribe cadre applied without the above qualification and the Public Service Commission selected the candidates through interview examination and issued appointment orders
 2004-05 or uske baad backlog niyuktiyon main koi dheel nahin di gai jabaki ye niyuktiyaan niyamanusaar lokseva ayog dwaara kii gayi
 On the other hand rules were relaxed for adhoc appointments
 13 saal se probeshan par naukari kar rahe in logon ke saath kya hoga, sarkaar kii taraf se koi thos jawaab nahin he magar madhyapradesh sarkaar kah rahi he ki wo sabhi college jinka bhawan nahin he or jo kahin or se sanchalit ho rahe hai unki imaaraten banengi
 489 crore has been given for this
 dikkat yahi he sarkarein elaan kar detii hai, tali baj jaati he
 Then she does not look back
 ab dekhie, mantriji nae medical college kholane kii baat bataa gaye, kuch nae sapane dikhaa gaye
 But Anurag wants to show you the reality of past decisions
 madhya pradesh ke tamaam medical, dental, nursing or ayurvedic collejon ko regulate karne vaali medical uniwarsity jabalpur ke darshan karana chaahate hai
 The Medical University, which handles the medical education sector of the entire state, operates in Jabalpur with four rooms for rent
 mahaz chaar kamaron se
 The waist of this university of four rooms is broken
 is medical uniwarsity main pichaasi fisadi se zyaada pad khaali pade hai
 Moreover, there is no exam controller in the university so that the state of medical education sector of the state can be understood
 mantri ji ne purana to thik nahin kiya magar nayaa elaan kar diya
 After all the scams and scams in the medical education world of Madhya Pradesh, the state government had established Madhya Pradesh Medical University to control the medical education sector
 saal 2011 main jabalpur main ye medical uniwarsity sthapit to kar di gai lekin sarkaar ne isaki taraf palat kar nahin dekha
 From this medical university, 16 medical, 12 dental, 17 Ayurveda, 23 homeopathy, 4 Unani, 3 Yoga, 171 nursing, 66 para medical colleges i
e
 total 312 colleges are covered under this university
 hairaani kii baat he ki apni sthapana ke chah saal baad bhi medical uniwarsity ke paas apni imaarat tak nahin he or uniwarsity ke 85 fisadi pad khaali hai
 If we look at the statistics of the sanctioned posts of the university, the total sanctioned posts are 275
 inamen ek kulapati, ek pariksha niyantrak, ek register, saat dipti register, 18 assistant register, baaki tritiy or chaturth shrenee ke pad hai
 Out of the 18 Assistant Registrar posts, only one post has been filled, out of the seven deputy registrar posts, only one post has been filled, while the remaining staff has only 35 people in total
 khud uniwarsity ke kulapati doctor ares sharma in halaat ko behad gambhir bataa rahe hai
 Now when you are told that someone has passed from medical college without a professor, what would you think before getting treatment with him
 ye bhi main bataaun yaa aap bataa denge
 On the other hand, from the responsible ministers of the state to the top officials, there has been talk of making the necessary facilities and facilities for the medical university soon, but such things have not had any effect in the last six years
 jabalpur nivasee pradesh ke chikitsa rajya mantri sharad jain ko maaloom hi nahin he ki is vishvavidhyalay main staff kii kami he
 When we told them, they are preparing to write a letter to the Vice Chancellor

 Half the time in the university and the rest of the time is given in the Home Guard Department

 bataaiye adhikaar bhi maang rahe hai to ritred logon ke liye jaise naujavaanon ne likhakar de diya he ki unhen naukari chahie hi nahin
 In the state where Vyapam, Demat and then Neet scams occurred, these are the circumstances of the Medical University
 chaar kamare main jahaan uniwarsity chalegi vahaan ghotaale nahin honge to kahaan honge
 The CBI has filed a charge sheet against 490 people in the Vyapam case
 itane to uniwarsity main professor nahin hai
 You are watching the financial condition of education
 madhyapradesh ucch shiksha vibhaag main lagbhag dhai hazaar sahaayak praadhyaapak tadarth yani edock niyukti vaale hai
 They are from the period 1984 to 1990 and are of backdoor entry
 inaki niyukti ke samay bhartee niyam 1967 lagu tha jisamen edock niyukti jaisaa koi shabd hi nahin tha
 That is, such appointments were against the rules
 in niyuktiyon ko sahi tehraane ke liye shashan ne pehle bhartee niyam 1990 banaaya or phir umr or shaikshanik yogyata main dheel dekar sabko niyamit kar diya
 For backlog appointments, in 2003, Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission released advertisement for the posts of Assistant Professor in which NET / SLET / Ph

 There was no relaxation in backlog appointments from 2004-05 onwards, while these appointments were made by the Public Service Commission as per rules
 duusari taraf niyam viruddh edock niyuktiyon ke liye dheel di gai
 What will happen to these people who have been working on probation for 13 years, there is no concrete answer from the government, but the Madhya Pradesh government is saying that all those colleges which do not have buildings and those which are being operated from elsewhere, will have buildings

 com / r3wbpo80m4 Sometimes the angry people of any country do not normally show such attitude
 besharm satta ke thapede jab bardaasht ke baahar ho jaaen, tabhi vah harkar apni niyati ko sweekaar lene se inkaar kar detii he
 She revolts
 vah har tarah kii vikrutiyon-vikaron, jhooth-fareb ke khilaaf uth khadi hoti he
 Clarion plays against them, who have become vassals of her misfortune by taking an oath to guard her destiny
 jab kisi desh kii aahat janata kaa gussa bhadakta he, aakhri bandishen bhi tut jaati hai or satta-shikhar par sadaandh hi badlaav kii raah prashast kar detii he
 If we look at the history related to the development of nations, then such opportunities are taken advantage of by outsiders untouched by the soot of power, rebels who unite the anger of the streets, or those who do something out of politics and stay out of the mainstream
 
 saal 2013 main desh kaa gussa charam par tha or saakh kho chuke rajnatik varg se chhutkaare ke liye uskaa dhairya chukta ja rahaa tha
 When the status quo is deeply irrelevant and moral urges are forgotten, a clean, new kind of leader emerges in the politics of the country, which is essentially outside the current political landscape
 vajah yah he ki maujuuda rajnatik daayre ke jane-pahachaane chehre, chaahe ve vampanthi hon yaa dakshinpanthi, apni vichaardhaaraon kii paramparaagat dharanaon se bandhe rahete hai, khaskar desh kii sabase puraani party ke bare main yah baat puri tarah sach he, jiske dhaanche kai tarah se bikhar rahe hai
 (arvind Kejriwal during a public meeting in Delhi on 22 December) In fact, the Indian National Congress leaning towards the Left is in a phase of deep stagnation and rot
 uski centre sarkaar desh kii sadakon or gharon main umad rahe gusse se ekadam beparwaah he
 The resting place of Raisina Hills area is very safe from the weather
 aise main dakshinpanthi party bijepi kaa rashtrawaad mushth bhar ooncha ho jaataa he or vah congress virodh kii sabase safal labhaarthi najar aati he
 In such an environment, a common man could be seen from outside the narrow streets of mainstream politics
 or vahi hua
 Arvind Kejriwal, a white cap of "I am a common man" on his head, a normal-looking 45-year-old, weighing 66 kg, weighing just five feet four inches, shook the conscience of the country and then the power-system
 To
 unke iraade fauladi hai, ankhon main gussa he, aawaaj main ummid he or man main pakkaa sankalp he
 Few such unique stories have achieved such a short time in the memory of the country, there are more stories of heroes who have reached the mythological history of democracy and resistance
 is purv inakam tex afasar ne shuruyaat soochna ke adhikaar (artiai) kaaryakarta kii tarah kii or usee dauraan unhen ehsaas hua ki sachaai to satta parivartan hi he
 Later he became the first soldier of the elderly Satyagrahi whose anti-corruption movement took over the hearts and minds of the angry youth of the country
 is tarah unhone anna hajaare ke saath rahakar logon ko jodgaye kii kala main maharath hasil kii
 Till then, Kejriwal was a reflection of political disagreement, rebellion against political immorality
 aam aadmi party (aap) ke gathan ke saath yah nausikhia peshewar netaa maidan main utar aayaa
 Such an adventure was called by Vaclav Havel as "non-political politics"
 checkoslovakia ke haivell itihaas kaa rukh modeye vaali nai bagawaton ke sabase anokhe nayak hai
 They call it "the politics that emerged from below, the politics of the man directly for the system, the politics that came out of the heart instead of any principle
" dilli kii uthal-puthal bhari sardiyon main yah gaiyr-rajnatik netaa saaf-safai ke jaadui jhaadu se apni aawaaj sunaane main kaamyaab rahaa he
 His sensational victory in Delhi's Assembly elections is like a motion of no confidence against the opinionated power-system
 (aktubar main vidhansabha prachaar karte hue arvind kejariwal)sadak kaa yoddha satta-tantra se apane sangharsh main kaaphi aage nikal aayaa he
 Today, he has become a symbol of the power of the common man, or the havell, "the force of the weak" or "satyamev Jayate"
 kejariwal kaa vichaar maujuuda raajnneeti kii har baat ke khilaaf he
 In the era when opacity has become the culture of the ruling class, they talk of transparency and accountability
 jis daur main alaakaman kii sarvocchata nirvivaad he, ve vikendrikaran or swaraj kaa paath padhaate hai
 "swaraj" is also the title of one of his booklets

 He writes, "the democracy going on in India today has to be changed
 loktantr kaa arth hona chahie ki vot hone ke paanch saal tak sarkari kaamkaaj logon kii ichchhaaon ke mutabik ho, or faisle karne se pehle logon ke vichaar par gaur kiya jaae

 According to Yogendra Yadav, a political scientist and philosopher in Kejriwal's court, he has "an extraordinary ability to be normal"
 india today jab is vicitra aam aadmi ke dilli se sate, gajiabad main girnaar apartments ke chauthi manzil ke flats main pahunchi to jo saamanyata dikhi, vah vaaki asaadhaaran thi

 It is an ongoing fight against corruption and injustice

 "" Is it possible to continue the same struggle even while in power? "" "of course, when you say that you are in power, it depends on how you see power

 If there is power facility then you will become a problem

 "" The romance of the struggle of the street warrior is over now, are you ready for the bitter reality of practical politics? "" He was never like a romance to us
 har maukey par ek jimmedaari kaa bhav tha
 If that romance had happened, we would have sat at home as soon as our anti-corruption movement had ended
 tab ham kaaphi gauravanvit ho chuke the
 When we formed a political party, we were called hungry for power
 hamane apni chhavi daanv par lagaai
 So then romance is no longer a matter of responsibility
 ’’‘‘phir bhi, aap pratirodh ke vichaar or prashasan kii vaastaviktaa main talmail kaise baithaayenge?’’‘‘saaf kahuun to hamaare paas koi jaadu kii chadi nahin he
 We are not at all forgetful that everything will change as soon as it comes to power
 lekin hamen vishwaas he ki ham dilli ke sabhi kareeb dedh karod logon ko saath lekar chalenge or koi aisi samasya nahin hogi jiskaa hal nahin nikalegaa
 There will be no ruler and governed

 Lokpal is the necessary new institution which will have to be created

 At the moment i cannot think of those institutions which have become redundant and which need to be abolished
 ’’‘‘aapako raishumaari kaa vichaar bahut bhaataa he

 lekin bade faislon par saal main ek baar, do saal main ek baar logon kii raay jaanane kii jarurat he
 i do not agree with the notion that unpopular decisions cannot be taken by opinion
 ek hi shart he ki hamen logon ke saamne sabhi pakshon ko puri eemaandaaree se rakhana chahie
 "there is honesty in Kejriwal's dialogue and there is no doubt in his views, the grin on his face shows that he has great reverence for his mission, as if karma is giving him strength and saying that the truth We have to keep moving forward on the path of ‘‘haa, main karm main yakeen karata hum
 In the days of IIT, when there was a strong emphasis on scientific thinking, i did not believe in God but for the last three years i have become relieved again
 jab hamaara andolan itnaa bada ho gaya, tab mujhe laga ki ham kitne chote hai
 Some divine miracle has happened
 ab yah hamaare liye aadhyatmik yatra kii tarah he
 "(kejriwal outside Delhi's Lt
 Governor's residence on 23 December) Faithful people can also say that Kejriwal's visit in the mud of Indian politics is nothing short of a miracle
 haalanki mukti kaa unka siddhant samaajawaadee rudhipoon, araajaktaavaad, gandhi ke asahyog or marks ke siddhanton kaa mishran he
 In his India, the village is the supreme parliament, the testimony of the crowd is true and the importance of parity, not competition in the market
 jhaadu, topi, raishumaari ke pratikon ke saath kejariwal kaa sangharsh or vijay gaatha saamaajik nyaay kaa kissa hi lagati he
 In the end, it is a war of justice for the common man and they want to remain normal

" unhone satta ko apni bapauti samajhane waalon ke liye khatre kii ghanti baja di he or bhrashtachariyon ke bich khalabali paidaa kar di he
 However, to instill fear in mainstream Indian politics, bring the fight against power and the struggle for power to a standstill, unite the rich and the underprivileged against the ruthlessness of power, and raise politics headlong Arvind Kejriwal is the headlines of the India Today 2013 headlines for launching a new freedom struggle
 centre kii modi sarkaar anaupchaarik rup se rajyapalon ko pad chhodane ke liye kah rahi he
 It has been claimed by Maharashtra Governor k Sankaranarayanan
 buudhvaar ko unhone sweekaar kiya ki grih sachiv anil goswami ne pichley hafte unhen do baar phone kiya or istipha dene ko kaha
 After Uttar Pradesh Governor BL Joshi, Chhattisgarh Governor Shekhar Dutt also resigned on Wednesday evening
 maharashtra ke rajyapal shankaranarayanan kaa kahana he ki unhone grih sachiv ko koi jawaab nahin diya or na hi apni raay jataai
 According to the news published in the English newspaper 'the Indian Express', Sankaranarayanan says that he has no problem with the Centre's decision to change the governor, but there is a problem in the way he is being asked to leave a constitutional post
 haalanki akhbaar se unhone yah bhi kaha ki loktantr main koi pad sthaayee nahin hota
 He will certainly think about this if authorized and properly taken a decision
 gauratlab he ki aisi khabaren ai thim ki modi sarkaar ne upie ke samay niyukt kiye gaye saat rajyapalon ko anaupchaarik rup se pad chhodane ko kaha he
 Uttar Pradesh Governor BL Joshi has also resigned
 haalanki anya kai pradeshon ke unke samakaksh abhi istife ke mood main nahin hai
 Pranab will have to convince the government, but according to the English newspaper 'hindustan Times', the government will have to persuade President Pranab Mukherjee to remove the governors and for this they will have to give concrete reasons before them
 sarkaar ko raashtrapati ke saamne yah sabit karnaa hoga ki unka faisla nyaayik rup se thik he
 The government may have to give a different reason for each case
 khabar he ki aise main piemo ne visheshgyon se kanoonee salaah leni shuru kar di he

 Although this will not stop Motorola's smartphones and the company will continue to make its smartphone but it is possible that the smartphone has 'moto by Lenovo' written on it

 After the death of ISEIS mastermind Abu Bakr al Baghdadi in June, there is now a news about his being alive in September
 is baar ye khabar ek audio tepe kii shakl main saamne ai he
 It is being said that this tape has the voice of Baghdadi and he has recorded this voice recently
 is audio massej ke zarie bagdadi ek baar phir logon ko jehad ke liye uksaa rah he saath hi nae hamale kii dhamkee de rahaa he
 Baghdadi also mentioned for the first time North Korea's threat of a nuclear attack on the US
 kehete hai ki wo awaz iesas sargandbu baqar al bagdadiki he
 It is said that Baghdadi has recorded this audio recently
 kehete hai ki bagdadi phir se duniya ke khilaaf zehar ugal rahaa he
 And they also say that Baghdadi is not dead at all, he is alive
 ji haa, bagdadi kaa jinn ek baar phir bottle se baahar aa gaya he
 Silence after June is suddenly broken by this one audio
 iesas kii taraf se jari 46 minute ke us audio main jo awaz he uske bare main daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki ye bagdadi kii hi awaz he
 Experts are also saying after listening to the voice recorded in the audio that this voice belongs to Baghdadi
 export ke mutabik pichley saal november main bagdadi kaa jo aakhri audio tepe aayaa tha us tepe main kaid awaz or is audio main darj awaz ek hi he
 So if Bagdadi really has the voice in the audio, it means that Baghdadi was not killed in the Russian airstrikes in Raqqa in June this year
 balki wo ab bhi zindaa he
 But a question still arises
 maan liya ki audio main aawaaj bagdadi kii hi he magar ye bhi to ho saktaa he ki gaye puraani ricarding ho? yani is saal june se pehle kii? yani bagdadi ke maut se pehle kii?magar aisa mumkin nahin he, kyonki is audio main bagdadi ek jagah north korea kii us dhamkee kaa zikr kar rahaa he jisamen kim jong un america or japan par parmaanu hamale kii baat kah rahaa he
 According to the Middle East Research Institute, these threats have been made recently
 wo bhi june ke baad
 That is, the audio recording is very recent
 institute kaa kahana he ki audio main darj awaz kii puri padtaal ke baad hi wo isaki ricarding kii sahi taarikh bataa sakate hai
 Through this audio released by isis-linked Al Furqan News Organization, Baghdadi has also called for targeting media headquarters while appealing for the continuation of jihad
 vah america ke kamazor hone kii bhi baat kah rahaa he
 Here is the translation of that audio - threatening North Korea, America and Japan for nuclear attack
 america or roosi naagarik apane hi mulk main mujahidinon ke dar se khauf ke saae main ji rahe hai
 The Turkish government has also been besieged on its own border due to the struggle of the Kurds
 turki or kurd aapasi khinchataan main buree tarah ulajh chuke hai
 Mujahideen you continue your jihad and do not give right to your enemies to live a good life at any cost
 kyonki tumhaare apane bhai bhi har rose bambaari, tabaahi or maut kaa shikaar ho rahe hai
 Mujahideen do not give up and remember their promise for their jihad
 tumhaari qarbaani jaaya nahin jaaegi
 This is the responsibility of all of you
 tumhaari or tumse pehle vaale bhaaiyon kii qurbaaniyaan jaaya naa jaaen
 Brothers America is weakening and Europe is also living under the shadow of our attacks
 isliye tumhaari jeet tay he
 After the introduction of this audio, the US has said so much that once the investigation of the voice captured in the audio is complete
 uske baad hi wo bataa paaegaa ki ye awaz bagdadi kii hi he or agar haa to kab kii? vaise america ne abhi tak bagdadi kii maut kaa daawa nahin kisia he
 Russia is making this claim only
 agar ye audio tepe sach he or awaz bhi bagdadi kii hi he to phir ye tay he kiais kaa sarganabagadadi jinda he
 But why is Baghdadi silent for the past several months? Why did not a fortress like Mosul come out even after being out of hand? And the biggest question is, where is Baghdadi hiding right now? If the US lieutenant general, who is leading the coalition forces in the ongoing war against IS in Iraq and Syria, believes that there are two places where Baghdadi can still be hidden

 inputah IANS BJP President Amit Shah today met Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev as part of his contact campaign in preparation for the next year's Lok Sabha elections
 ramdev ne unako samarthan kaa vaayada bhi kiya
 The special thing is that Ramdev was at the Ramlila Maidan in Delhi on the same four years exactly seven years before today and was holding a grudge against the then UPA government
 uske baad maidan par jo kuch hua usne ramdev ko sidhe-sidhe bijepi ke kheme main laakar daal diya
 Till then, Swami Ramdev was such a face of the country, who had acceptance and respect for almost every section of the political parties and society
 kya hua tha 4 june 2011 ko?upie sarkaar ke karpshan or desh main badhati blikemani kii samasya ke khilaaf yoga guru swami ramdev ne aitihaasik jang chhedi
 First, he traveled around the country and gathered public support and after that, on June 4, 2011, announcing the government's fight, he sat on a hunger strike at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan
 unke is anshan ko hajaaron logon ne ramlila maidan pahunchakar samarthan diya
 a large section of the country also sat on a dharna in support of this movement
 ramdev ke jalwe kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki jab ve is andolan main shaamil hone dilli ke indira gandhi hawaii adde par pahunche to unke swaagat main manmohan sarkaar ke diggaj mantri jinamein pranab mukherjee, pi chidambaram, kapil sibbal bhi shaamil the, hawaii adde pahunche
 After Ramdev's honor, these ministers talked to Ramdev in a hotel in Delhi
 hotel main lambii baatcheet ke baad ramdev jab baahar laute to unhone media se koi baat nahin kii
 His fast began on Ramlila Maidan the next day, but the government ministers kept trying to end his fast in the evening behind the scenes
 jab ramdev ne anshan khatm karne se inkaar kar diya to tatkaaleen kanoon mantri kapil sibbal ne pressvarta kii
 Sibal then showed a letter to the media which had the signature of Balakrishna, an aide of Baba Ramdev
 is patr main kaha gaya tha ki ramlila maidan par sirf ek din kaa satsang hoga
 After the letter was made public in the media, journalists bombarded questions on Ramdev at the Ramlila ground
 ramdev ne tab gusse main elaan kiya ki ab ve kisi surat main ramlila maidan se nahin hatenge jab tak unki maangen puri na ho jaaen
 After this, on the orders of Home Minister p Chidambaram, Delhi Police took direct action at Ramlila Maidan at around 12 pm
 jabaran lathicharge kar maidan ko khaali karaayaa gaya
 In this stampede, one of Baba's devotee Rajbala was seriously injured, who died after long treatment
 khud ramdev vahaan se gaayab ho gaye or duusare din channelon par unki footage jab saamne ai to ve uttarakhand main najar aae
 Baba was wearing a women's salwar-suit at that time
 ramdev isi vesh main media ke saamne aae or unhone upie sarkaar ke khilaaf bigul phoonk diya
 He alleged that his murder was hatched in Ramlila Maidan
 ramdev ne iske baad aspataal main hi apana anshan jari rakhaa jise baad main sadhu-santon ne tudvaya
 After that, many cases were filed against Ramdev and his associate Balakrishna
 baalkrishna kii naagarikta, patanjali ke utpaadon kii gunvattta par sawaal uthe
 An attempt was also made to clamp down on Baba's search for the missing master, but Ramdev successfully cut the difficult period
 2014 main modi kaa kiya tha prachaar2013 main jab bijepi ne narendra modi ko apana pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaaya to ramdev ne khule taur par unka samarthan kiya
 Ramdev also campaigned throughout the country in support of the BJP on the promise of bringing back black money and a corruption-free government
 is dauraan ramdev ne puure desh kaa daura kiya
 No statement against the government Since 2014, ever since Narendra Modi took power at the Center, Ramdev has not made any statement against the government
 haalanki, bich main kai baar unhone jwalit muddon par apni tippanee jarur kii
 But it did not give any statement against the government
 kalaadhan, vikaas, bhrashtachar ke mudde par ramdev hameshaa modi sarkaar ke saath hi khadey dikhe
 Ramdev started market expansion of his Patanjali brand since 2014, from Yogguru to Market Guru Ramdev
 pichley 4 saal main patanjali kaa turnover hajaaron karod tak pahunchaa
 Today it has reach in almost every house in the country
 emmemasiji product se lekar anya jarurat ke saamaan main har jagah ab patanjali kii upasthiti he
 Recently they have also launched their SIM
 tasveeron main dekhen kya-kya hua tha 4 june kii raat klub shah ne 2019 ke liye maanga samarthahub kareeb 7 saal baad jab desh ek ore loksabhaa chunaav ke kareeb khadaa he
 Then on June 4, Ramdev met Amit Shah, the president of the ruling party Bharatiya Janata Party
 amit shah ne 2014 main bani narendra modi sarkaar ke chaar saal puure hone par apane kaamkaaj kaa byoraa saunpa
 Amit Shah said that in 2014 Ramdev supported us, now we have come to give him our account
 unhone kaha ki hamen ummid he ki 2019 main bhi yogaguru ramdev hamaara samarthan karenge
 See how Ramdev will make a difference in the Satyagraha of the crushed Baba Satyagraha in 2019? Now that the 2019 election is at the head, Ramdev is once again at the center
 ramdev ke desh main karodon anuyaayi hai, yoga ke dam par ramdev ne ghar-ghar main pahchaan banaai he, iske baad ab patanjali product ke dam par bhi ramdev har ghar main pahunche hai
 In such a situation, it has to be seen whether Ramdev will once again openly support the BJP and will be able to influence the election

 2 have died in this accident while 3 injured are injured
 noida prashasan lagaataar ho rahe haadason se bhi sabak nahin le rahaa he
 This is why the builder dug up a pit for new construction between buildings even after public protests, causing a crack in the wall of the 13-story building adjacent to it
 kabhi bhi gir sakati he greater noida kii 13 manjila imaratdarasal, greater noida ke posh sector beta-2 main nai building banane ke liye kii gai gahari khudaai kii gai or usamen jame pani kii vajah se paas kii 13 manjila building par khatra mandaraane laga he

 The police station is also nearby, but no one paid attention to this major danger and excavation
 haalanki, logon ke virodh ke baad greater noida prashasan ection main aayaa he
 Pump was brought out to drain the water
 gadde ko bharne kaa kaam bhi shuru ho gaya
 But, the question arises why the Greater Noida administration did not see this pit and the threat it poses earlier
 building jhuki, dar se logon ne khaali kiya makanshahberi ilaake main hi main ek or building kabhi bhi gir sakati he
 The 7-storey building has fallen to one side due to rain water

 Small builders have wrongly built dangerous buildings in collusion with babus in the Authority
 bilderon ne imaaraton main bukamparodhi or prakritik aapadaa se bachane kii jarurat ko bhi nazarandaaj kar diya
 In such a situation, the question arises that why hundreds of small buildings built by defrauding the rules and regulations were not seen by the government officials earlier? Why does the administration come into action only after the accident? ponji skim ghotaale main pravartan nideshaalay ne somvaar ko badi karrwai kii he

 Is only far jharkhand (jharkhand Assembly Election 2019)main duusare charan ke matdaan ke liye prachaar ab jor pakadta ja rahaa he
 But all eyes are on the second Jamshedpur East seat
 isliye nahin ki mukhyamantri raghuvar das vahaan se chhathi baar vidhayak banane kii res main hai balki isliye logon kii dilchaspee is baar kuch zyaada dikh rahi he kyonki chunaav maidan main unako chunauti dene vaale ke mantrimandal ke sahyogi or bijepi ke varisht netaa sarayu raay hai
 Saryu Rai has been duly suspended by the party
 mangalvaar ko raghubar das ke samarthan main prachaar karne khud pradhan mantri narendra modi jamshedpur pahunche
 Saryu Rai is the same person whose name was being decided in bjp's ticket distribution in New Delhi
 tab party ke adhyaksh amit shah ne unke naam par khulkar apni asahmati jataayi thi or or ek nahin kai kaaran unako tikat naa dene ke ginaye the
 But at the same time, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar not only openly supported his candidature but believed that a person like him was surprised by not getting the ticket
 nitish ne to yahaan tak kah daalaa ki jab 10 varsh purv sarayu raay chunaav haar gaye the tab unhone unhen waapas bihar aane kaa nyauta diya tha
 But Nitish Saryu Rai was not in the mood to leave BJP at that time
 bhartiya janata party ke ek or saansad subramanyam swami ne bhi raay ke samarthan main twit kar unhen tikat na dene par aashcharya vyakt kiya he
 Swamy has also appealed to the Prime Minister to make him the next Chief Minister
 iske alaava vartmaan main wo jharkhand mukti morcha ho yaa argedy ke lalu yadav sabane apane netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ko raay ke samarthan main kaam karne kaa nirdesh diya he
 But the question is, after all, who are these Saryu Rai whom Amit Shah loves so much and Nitish Kumar loves so much
 baqul nitish kumaar jaanate hai unako jab chaatr jivan main khaaskar JP andolan main ek saath kaam karte the
 At that time Nitish Kumar was in the Samajwadi Yuvjan Sabha and an active worker of Saryu Rai Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad
 donon patna science college main bhi saath the or aaj tak in dono netaaon ke bare main ek baat saamaanya he kii ye apane doston ke liye khaaskar college or skool ke dinon ke doston ko kabhi bhoolatey nahin or iske liye wo kisi se bhi lard sakate hai or kisi se bhi madad maang sakate hai
 But Saryu Rai came up for discussion in the eighties for two reasons
 ek congressi raaj main jepi kii pratimaa lagane main jisamen in logon ko kaafii sangharsh karnaa padaa
 Patna will be the only city where the idols of Nehru and Indira are not, but two major intersections of JP are sculpted
 duusari koaparative maffia ke kilaaf jab unhone awaz buland kii
 At that time no one could think that anyone could take the iron from this cooperative mafia
 lekin sarayu raay ne jab ghatiya khaad ke kaaran kisaanon ke fasal barbaad kaa mudda media, court sab jagah awaz uthaayi or jab congress party ke hi bhagwat jha azaad kii sarkaar bani to unke report ke aadhaar par sab sahakaarita samiti ko bhang kiya gaya or ab kendriya mantri rajkumaar singh bisakoman ke pehle prashaasak bane
 But when Lalu Yadav's government was formed in 1990, he was made a member of the Irrigation Commission by the then Irrigation Minister Jagadanand Singh due to his knowledge and interest on the subject related to agriculture and irrigation, but within two years, Rai was disillusioned with Lalu Yadav on this basis
 It was that he was working on keeping a lot of rules and laws in finance matters and Rai started writing about him in the local Hindi newspaper
 lekin lalu is samay lokapriyata ke shikhar par ja rahe the isliye unhen in sabhi lekh kii koi parvaah nahin kii
 He told a lot to Nitish Kumar on the pretext of Rai
 kyonki lalu, nitish or sarayu raay ke sambandh se bhalee bhaanti parichit the
 This was the period when Amit Shah used to visit Lalu Yadav's Chief Minister's residence in connection with the payment of his pipe business
 ye baat haal ke din main khud bihar ke up mukhyamantri susheel modi ne ek sabha main logon ko bataaya
 As far as the fodder scam is concerned, everyone knew the sources behind the scam, but no one believed his words except Saryu Rai or you say Rai was the only person to know about the true nature of the scam
 Was confident baharhaal jab ghotaalaa sieji report ke aadhaar par saamne aayaa to sara piiel draft karne kaa zimmaa raay ne ravishankar prasad ko diya kyonki unhen ek ashanka thi ki agar BJP ke varisht vakeelon ko bhi is kaam kaa zimmaa diya jayega to lalu yadav unako manage kar sakate hai
 It is also true that at that time the BJP was avoiding putting its hand in the fodder scam because many of its Ranchi leaders were well aware of their relationship with the mafia of the scam and the party felt that the more it would throw it on the party Can
 us samay keen govindacharya kii tuuti bolti thi jinhone bihar BJP main amulchul parivartan karte hue susheel modi , nand kishor yadav , sarayu raay jaise netaaon ko aage kiya or 1996 ke loksabhaa chunaav se sarayurai ko aaj ke jharkhand or us samay 14 lok sabhakshetron kaa prabhaar de diya tha yahaan BJP kaa strike rate hameshaa behatar rahaa
 When the separate Jharkhand state was formed in 2000, he had a role as a troubleshooter
 haalanki us samay wo bihar vidhaan parishad ke sadsy the isliye jharkhand sarkaar main sidhe shaamil nahin ho sakate the lekin jab pehali sarkaar babulal marandi ke netritv main bani to wo bhi ek alpamat kii sarkaar thi or wo sarkaar janata dal united ke upar nirbhar rahati thi
 To persuade these people, Saryu Rai was responsible for all these tasks
 baad main 2005 main jamshedpur se wo vidhayak bhi hue lekin us samay bhaajapa kii sarkaar bahut kam dinon ke liye ban pai or ab tak kaa sabase vivaadaaspad madhu koda kii sarkaar bani jo ek nirdaleey vidhayak the jinako baahar se JMM congress ke samarthan se mukhyamantri banaaya gaya tha
 During this period, the looting was at the peak and most of the people in his cabinet were not only accused of scam but they also had to go to jail, out of them, 1 of them was included by BJP in this election, this time he was included in his party
 Also made a candidate for saal 2014 ke shasankaal main sarayu raay mantri to bane lekin dhire dhire raghuvar das ne use ek ke baad ek vibhaag le liya or ek aisa samay aayaa jab raay ne mantrimandal kii baithak main bhaag lenaa hi band kar diya jo unke tikat kaatane main ek mukhya aadhaar bhi tha
 Right now Rai may win or lose elections from Jamshedpur East, but he has given a point to the opposition parties in the politics of Jharkhand that the BJP, which claims to eradicate corruption, ousted a ticket exposing a scam like him and Bhanu Pratap, accused in the 130 crore drug scam, was awarded tickets by including such people in the party

 The project has been started twice with big promises, but was interrupted before the iron was carved to produce a smaller replica

 They are not only armored, but are also equipped with cannon and anti-missile and heavy machine guns to help the infantry accompanying them
 haalanki exysivi pariyojna abhi yubhumi kaa apana pehla charan yani naukarshahi ko hi paar nahin kar saki he
 The project was launched in 2009 and was scrapped in 2012

 The DPB is yet to decide which agency it will develop

 Ten companies were invited by the Ministry of Defense, out of which six companies accepted the 2015 EOI (expression of Interest) of the Ministry
 ye companiyaan thim el and tii, mahindra and mahindra, peepavav dephence, oefbi or tata power kii sanyukt company esaidi-titagarh vaighans, tata motors or bharat forj limited
 Last November, the Defense Ministry prepared a final list of five of these companies
 uske baad se deepibi kii pichley saal sitambar, november or is varsh march main teen baithken ho chuki hai, lekin abhi do companiyon par muhar lagani baaki he
 That is, the project is where it started
 exysivi kaa aadesh jari hone se pehle kam se kam teen mahatvapurn kadam uthaae jane hai—nijee kshetra kii agenciyon kii shinaakht, vistrut pariyojna report taiyaar kiya janaa or ant main do pratikrutiyon main se ek kaa antim rup se chayan
 This process can take up to seven years
 exysivi ke liye 2009 main shuru kii gai prakriya ke tahat to 2017 main utpaadan shuru ho janaa tha
 The delay of three years now means that the FICV order can now be issued only around the year 2024
 raksha mantralay ke sheersh adhikari bataate hai ki is samay jo baadha najar aa rahi he uske peeche chhanti gai paanch companiyon main se ek kii ore se kii gai shikaayat he
 Last year, the Mahindra Defense System had requested the Defense Ministry to disqualify three companies whose financial condition was seen to be irregular
 yah maamla november, 2017 main swatantra visheshgy nirikshakon (iiem) ke ek dal ko saunpa gaya tha, jisane is shikaayat ko bedam paaya
 However, the project did not proceed even after that

 These Soviet-style icvs were incorporated 38 years ago in 1980 and were manufactured under license in Medak, now in Telangana
 sena is saal se biempi-2es ko badalane kaa kaam shuru karegi
 ficvs are nowhere to be seen, nor are there funds to develop them, this is important because it was assumed that the Ministry of Defense would bear 90 per cent of the cost of the project and the rest would go to the private sector

 In the report of the Standing Committee on Defense Affairs laid in the Lok Sabha on March 13, the Deputy Chief of Military Services, Lt

 Incidentally, the construction projects have also gone beyond the government's pioneering campaign "make in India", as the Ministry of Defense is spending research and building proprietary defense systems

 Its first attempt failed in 2012 because, according to the military, there was no connection between the IPMT and the acquisition unit to the EOE

 In fact, the military forces want to change their military equipment of the Soviet era in a big way, the Indian industry wants a large share in the production of military equipment, which is currently monopolized by the defense-related government undertakings

 pratiraksha kaa yah sabase bada akelaa anubandh he, lekin aage nahin bad paa rahaa he
 On 13 March, the Stockholm Institute of Peace and Research International stated in its annual report that India was the world's largest importer of weapons and accounted for 12 per cent of worldwide arms transfers between 2007 and 2017

 The project could have a major impact on Indian industry
 sena ne sanket die hai ki mote taur par ek exysivi kii laagat bees se tees karod rupye ke bich baithegi
 60 per cent of this will come from local industry, ie from the developers of the project
 yahaan tak ki ingine or transmishan jaise mahatvapurn aaayaatit hisse, jo kul aaayaatit purjon kaa 40 fisadi he, unka nirmaan bhi aakhirkaar desh ke bheetar ho saktaa he
 Currently, FICV is on paper and there is bureaucratic hurdle in the path of indigenous weapons in India, not financial or technology

 Apart from this, due to the high premium on bright color cars, people are not interested in them
 jahaan tak laal rang kii baat he to use kaale se zyada pasand kiya jaataa he
 In North India, white color is more attracted
 jedy power ke mutabik yahaan lagbhag 66 pratishat log is rang ko pasand karte hai
 In South India, 34 percent prefer white color
 yah bhi dilachasp he ki kaaron ke rang kii pasandgi kaaron ke segment se bhi judi hui he
 61 percent of the cars in the luxury segment are white colored
 is segment ke log kaale rang ko bhi pasand karte hai or lagbhag 12 pratishat kaali kaaren kharidte hai
