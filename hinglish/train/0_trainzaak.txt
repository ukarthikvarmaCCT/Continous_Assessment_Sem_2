 Can there be any concrete way of measuring the success of foreign policy, just as the success or failure of economic policies is measured by looking at the rate of economic growth? Diplomatic dialogues have a large proportion of abstraction strategies, but so are abstraction in economic policies

 In the light of the economic review, the impact of the FTA system on India's foreign trade can be examined concretely and factually
 is padtaal kaa ek sutreey nishkarsh yah he ki jin deshon ke saath bharat ne dotarafa yaa bahupaksheeya mukt yaa variyak vyapaar samjhaute (pat / pitie) kiye hai, unke saath 2010 se 2014 ke bich kul vyapaar main 50 fisadi kii badhotaree hui
 Reason: Countries involved in FTA / PTA reduce customs duty for imports from other countries and limit trade restrictions, which has a direct bearing on trade growth
 duniya main vyapaar samjhauton ko lekar teen tarah ke model sakriy hai
 The first category is the multilateral trade treaties like the WTO, Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP)
 dablutio bahut safal nahin rahaa jabaki tipipi kii jameen abhi taiyaar ho rahi he
 The second category is the regional trade bloc ASEAN (organization of south-east Asian Countries), NAFTA (north America), EU (european Community) which have been very successful in increasing regional trade
 teesraa varg pat kaa he jo duniya main vyapaar or nivesh badhaane kaa sabase pramukh jariya banakar ubhare hai
 These include bilateral agreements between countries and agreements with trade blocks
 is hode main bharat kaaphi peeche he
 India started the FTA in 1970 with the India Africa Trade Agreement but by 2010 there have been only 19 ftas while the world has had an average of 15 ftas every year from 2004 to 2014, 20 more in the intervening years
 Has been above 25
 bharat ke zyaadaatar pat asia main hai
 The two ftas out of Asia are with Mercosur (brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Venezuela) and Chile
 vyapaar kii maatra ke aadhaar par asia main bharat ke sabase mahatvapurn pat asian, korea or japan ke saath hai
 According to the Economic Review, India's trade has increased by 50 per cent after the FTA with these countries
 in deshon ke alaava jin anya deshon se bharat ke pat hai, un deshon ke saath pat se pehle, 2007 se 2014 ke dauraan bharat ke niryaat kii vruddhi dar 13 fisadi thi jo pat ke baad 22 fisadi ho gai jo mukt vyapaar samjhauton kii safalataa kaa pramaan he
 India's FTA (2010) with ASEAN is considered the most successful
 taaja aankade taakid karte hai ki 2014 tak chaar varshon main asian deshon ko bharat kaa niryaat 25 fisadi badha jo pat se pehle 14 fisadi tha
 Imports grew at 19 per cent, up from 13 per cent before the FTA
 asian kii safalataa ke baad bharat va europea sangh ke bich pat ko lekar ummiden kaaphi oonchi thim kyonki europe duniya kaa doosraa sabase bada bazaar he or bhartiya niryaat main nai urja ke liye is bazaar main pravesh jaruri he
 Sadly, this important initiative stalled where the Modi government's confusion and conservatism stalled
 natijatan is saptaah brussels main iyu ke saath bharat kaa shikhar sammelan to hua lekin sabase mahatvapurn agenda yani pat par koi baat nahin bani or puraa aayojan keval event diplomasi banakar rah gaya
 If the economic review is correct, then it is the government's fault to stop the EU FTA under pressure from indigenous Pongapanthi
 darasal, kisi bhi tarah variyak vyapaar samjhauton ko rokna yaa un par apni taraf se pahal nahin karnaa ek badi kootnithik chook he jo pichley do saal main sarkaar ne baar-baar kii he
 If India's exports today are at the lowest level of 15 months, perhaps a big reason is that the Modi government did not speed up the free market agreements due to protectionist requests
 pradhanmantri ko yah samajhnaa hoga ki kisi bhi desh ke videsh vyapaar kii safalataa ab prifrencial trade agreements par nirbhar he or yah agreement kootnithik abhiyaanon se nikalate hai
 The magic of his diplomatic campaigns has started coming down because his diplomacy lacks the consciousness of a free and liberal market

 haalanki, akhtar ne mana ki babar ajam pakistan ke liye mahatvapurn ran bana rahe hai, lekin unhone yah bhi kaha ki vah match ko khatm nahin kar paa rahe
 Earlier, Pakistan batsman Babar Azam had told in an interview that he is learning to bat by watching Kohli's video
 akhtar ne apane utyub channel par post kiye video main kaha, 'main babar ajam se kahana chahta hum ki agar tum viraat kohli ko apana adarsh maanate ho to uski tarah khelnaa bhi siikho

 akhtar ne kaha, 'agar aap viraat, rohit sharma or ken williamson jaise khilaadiyon ko dekhen to ye sabhi khilaadi ardhashatak banane ke baad ran gati main ijapha karte hai
 Azam should learn from these players
 uske paas zyada shot hone chahie

 He had also expressed anger at Babar Azam during that time and said that he had forgotten to rotate the strike
 jab wo kehete hai ki viraat kohli mere fevorett hai to unhen ye sochna chahie ki viraat 25 ran banaate hai to 15 ran bhagkar lete hai or 2 chauke lagaate hai lekin babar ne kya kiya

 chidabaram se jude airsel-mexis maamle ko uthaaya tha to tatkaaleen sarkaar ne unke tathaa unke parijanon ke phone tap ke aadesh de diye the
 Making serious allegations, Sinha said that he is not afraid of these activities like phone taps and that the Congress should make a lot of efforts but his party will continue to fight against its corruption
 unhone kaha ki yah congress kii aadat he ki vah apane khilaaf bolne waalon ke khilaaf kisi bhi had tak ja sakati he
 He alleged that Congress President Sonia Gandhi had instructed her mps to retaliate against the BJP, instead of feeling embarrassed after her government was surrounded in the coal mine scam worth millions of crores

 Yashwant Sinha alleged, 'sonia Gandhi is arrogant and that is why she has asked Congress mps and leaders to backfire on BJP
 ’ sinha ne kaha ki kya loktantr main vipaksh se baat karne kaa yahi tarika he
 He reminded the Bajpai government that in his time, in such a situation, Bajpai himself used to talk about bringing the opposition together, but here everything is the opposite
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki congress is ghotaale ke puure maamle par pardaa daalane kaa prayaas kar rahi he lekin bhaajapa aisa hone nahin degi
 He reminded the Congress's dealings with Murali Manohar Joshi in the PAC in the 2G case and said that there is a real character of the Congress
 vah to vastav main aise muddon par bahes hi nahin chaahati hai
 Sinha accused the Congress of acting in revenge and misusing the CBI against its opponents
 unhone kaha ki kis prakaar congress sarkaar ne bhaajapa ke kendriya mantri arun shori tathaa anya ke khilaaf samay-samay par sibiai jaanch kaa prayaas kiya lekin unhen kya hasil hua

 ) Congress President Sonia Gandhi, calling for change of power in West Bengal, blamed the Left Front government for failing to use central funds for the development of the state
 sonia gandhi ne congress or trinmul congress ke ummidavaaron ke paksh main chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, ‘rajya main yah parivartan kaa samay he
 i appeal to voters to vote for the congress-trinamool alliance
 ’unhone kaha, ‘centre ne is rajya ko kaaphi dhan diya he, lekin iskaa asar kahin nahin dikhaa
 Raising the question, he said that people should ask the question of the Left Front government that where did the Central Fund money go
 sonia gandhi ne kaha ki centre main congress kii aguwai vaali sarkaar ne sabhi tabake ke logon ke liye kaam kiya he, jo pehle kisi bhi gaiyr congressi sarkaar ne nahin kiya
 The Congress President said that some districts of the state are among the poorest districts in the country
 adhikansh hisson main sinchai kii paryaapt vyavastha nahin he or ek tihaai janata ko pine kii pani kii suvidha hi nahin he
 During the rally, the Congress President accused the state government of discriminating in implementing development projects in areas where Congress has a strong support base
 unhone kaha, ‘har tabake ke logon ko kathinaayee jhelni pad rahi he
 It is the responsibility of the government to pay attention to all sections
 yadi kendriya kosh kaa bengal main thik tareeke se istemaal kiya gaya hota to is tarah ke halaat nahin hote
 Accusing the Left Front government, Gandhi said that during his 34-year rule in the state, he only sold dreams to the people
 unhone kaha, ‘yah samay he jab aap yah sawaal kar sakate hai ki unhone vaade kyon nahin puure kiye
 Does communism mean that people should become poorer? Gandhi said the Center introduced insurance for the unorganized sector workers, including MNREGA and Bharat Nirman Yojana for the poor

 For the past decade, she has been one of the powerful women in politics and is in complete control of the conscience of a party whose story has been associated with the world's most liberal democracy since its emergence

 Despite this, a struggle continues - the struggle between Sonia and Gandhi
 yah sangharsh he hakeekat or viraasat ke boj kaa
 Despite the mandate of 2004, she was not the kind of Gandhi who could keep India awake
 lekin shanivaar ko jab 2009 ke aam chunaavon main padaa aakhri vot gina ja rahaa tha or congress ne 200 siton kaa aankada chhu liya tha, bharat kii sabase puraani party kii sabase kaddavar netaa sonia gandhi ne antat shrimati ji
 Attained the title of Sonia and eventually became the new Indira of India
 " "isaki shuruyaat paanch baras pehle dridhtaa se kahe gaye 'naa' se hui thi jab unhone sansad ke kendriya kaksh main khadey hokar apratyaashit tareeke se mili jeet kii chamak se khud ko dur kar liya tha
 On that day, India was almost ready to accept its first prime minister of foreign origin, breaking her party's heart by making a sensational statement of renunciation in those moments filled with squeamish expressions of superlatives
 or phir unhone sheersh pad ke liye ek aise vyakti ko chunaa jisamen koi khaas mahatvakanksha nahin thi or jo sahi myne main raajnneetik bhi nahin thah kartavyanishth dow
 Manmohan Singh
 satta kii is nai dohari vyavastha main ve adhishthatri hai or ve padalankrita aagyaakaari
 Today, when he is dominated by his party, his aura and brilliance has arisen and it is possible that the eyes of the Congressmen will be aroused
 isse do or netaaon kaa kad badha haih manmohan or rahul gandhi
 This victory underscores the strength of the trio
 vansh kii takat kii is kahani main pehali baar aam aadmi ko aage rakhkar gandhi kii sarvocchata phir se sthapit kii gai
 By becoming generously democratic, they restored the longest-running political dynasty in the world
 vastav main ab tak jinke bare main yah mana jaataa tha ki ve sanyog se pradhanmantri bane hai, prachaar kaa naaraa ban gaye or beshak vahi ek aisa naaraa hai parivaar ne jise daanv par lagane laayak mana
 Otherwise, nothing else mattered except the miracle of Gandhi in the past
 jeet ke baad jab ve 10 janpath main sanyukt rup se prastut hue to yah darasal ek duusare kii tarif karne kii hi saarvajanik abhivyakti thi
 While he saluted the people of the country for making the right choice, the Prime Minister credited the victory to the leadership of Sonia Gandhi and the 'hard work' of the young leader Rahul Gandhi
 unki yah vinamrata ek tarah se sach kii hi abhivyakti thi
 The Congress, led by Sonia, has acquired its original identity of being a comprehensive party, now once again it has become a shadowy banyan tree under which everyone can take refuge whether it is a Brahmin, a Muslim or a Dalit
 unhone party kaa paaramparik vot bank waapas hasil kar liya he
 The party, with its share of around 30 per cent of the votes, attributes its rise to the new Mrs g and looks like the old Congress
 " "is jeet kii jo teesri takat he, vahi aprihaary rup se bhavishya he
 Rahul, who used to be a prince with disdain, took up the task of campaigning for the Congress
 party kii paaramparik samajhadaari ko dhata bataakar unhone viraasat sanbhaalane ke liye khud ko abhishikt kiya
 The rahul-dal set the terms of the relationship with the various parties as the allies started doing their own free will
 or behad saahas ke saath unhone us uttar pradesh main akele hi maidan main utarane kaa faisla kiya jo kabhi congress kaa garh hua karata tha
 This theory of Rahul worked; The party was largely successful in regaining its lost land which it had lost to the BSP and the SP
 congress ne is pradesh main apana aankada dogune se bhi zyada kar liya or iskaa puraa shrey unheen ko jaataa he
 They now say that this mandate is a challenge and the real work will start now
 unhone kaha, ''ham aapako uttar pradesh main nai congress party denge
 "his voice resonates with his father as he said after the huge success in 1984
" is chunaav ne congress main aadhikarik rup se uttaradhikaar kii rasm puri kii
 And Rahul flew from the workplace of the nehru-gandhi dynasty
 congress kii tikdi kii jeet ke jashn ke vipareet bhartiya raajnneeti ke anathak yatri laalkrishna adwani kii apni traasadee he
 They could not reach anywhere around the destination and the party they formed suffered another bad defeat
 darasal america raashtrapati ke chunaav sareekhe apane yojanabaddh prachaar abhiyaan ko 82 varshiya adwani ne umr ke is padaav par aadhuniktaavaadi hokar apane liye janamat sangrah main tabdeel kar diya tha
 Thus, instead of campaigning for BJP, it became Advani's march which eventually reached nowhere
 jab ''nirnaayak sarkaar dene ke vaaste ek drudh netaa'' ne ''kamjor pradhanmantri'' ko chunauti di to sonia ne manmohan ko bhaajapa kii pradhanmantri pad kii fantasy ke tagade jawaab ke rup main prastut kiya
 Advani, who moved with the times, failed to convince India
 ve aisa koi sandesh nahin de sake jo samay kii jaruraton se mail khaataa ho
 The BJP, lost in the identity crisis and ideological confusion, lost the middle class
 use atal bihari vaajapeyi jaise sarvaswikaarya netaa kii kami behad khali
 Now the challenge before the party is to regain its own costume of the most different looking party
 or iske liye ek alag tarah ke netritv kii jarurat he jo aisa kar sake
 The challenge is no less for the winner
 congress ne sabko saath lekar chalane kii raajnneeti se jeet pai or janadesh sthayitv ke liye he
 But the biggest challenge for him will be to maintain the victory

 Those people are simply choosing an accidental profession
 sawaal: kisi bhi candidet ko campus se sidhe job market main aane par khud main basic change laane chahie?jawaab:offis or campus ke maahaul main kaaphi change hota he
 Therefore, the candidate should make considerable changes accordingly
 sabase pehle use kaaphi jimmedaar or acounteble hona chahie
 Not only this, he should also be able to develop relations, take decisions and logically put forth his point
 sawaal: candidet ko hair karne main soshal media kaa kya role he?jawaab:companiya aaj ke daur main soshal media ke jariye candidet ke najadik aa rahi hai
 There are many options like Facebook, Twitter, which provide a lot of personal information about the candidate
 iske alaava soshal media ke jariye aap candidet kaa becoground to chack kar hi sakate hai saath hi kaam ko lekar bhi kaaphi assesament kar sakate hai

 tii20 cricket kaa mahakumbh ipel shuru ho chukaa he
 Some new teams are eager to leave their mark this season
 vahiin kuch khilaadiyon kii koshish he ki jo repyutesan unhone pichley kuch saalon main banaai he usko barkaraar rakhaa jaae, taaki aane vaale samay main vah apni daavedaari rashtriya team main pesh kar saken
 Raina and Yuvraj's career is taking last breath At the same time, Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina, who are considered among the most aggressive batsmen of Team India, have not performed according to their stature in the last few times
 suresh raina kaa pradarshan asia cap se lekar world tii20 tak lagaataar girtaa hi najar aayaa
 Weakness against short ball Raina could not finish in his ten year career
 haalanki yuvaraj ko jab-jab maukey mili unhone acha khilne kii puri koshish kii
 But there is also no denying that Yuvraj's age, his fitness and his body are now being hampered by his performance
 form, fitness or umr ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ab yah baat kahi ja sakati he ki in donon khilaadiyon kaa kariyar apane antim padaav par he
 Manish Pandey and Sarfaraz Khan's consistent good performance
 Any talent is ruined if it is not put in the right place at the right time
 manish pandey or sarfaraj khan pichley kuch saalon se har level par ran bana rahe hai
 27-year-old Manish Pandey has scored more than five thousand runs in 75 first class matches at an average of 50
 vahiin mahaj 18 saal kii umr main hi sarfaraj khan ne bade-bade diggajon kaa dil jeeta he or lagaataar ran bhi banaae hai
 However, Manish has been selected in Team India and he has also strengthened his claim by scoring a century in Australia
 lekin raina or yuvaraj ke kaaran unako world tii20 or asia cap kii team main jagah nahin mil pai thi
 Sarfaraz Khan was the highest run-scorer for India in the Under-19 World Cup under the supervision of Rahul Dravid
 sarfaraj ne puure world cap main 70 kii ausat se 355 ran banaae or overol sabase zyada ran banane waalon kii fehrist main vah duusare number par rahe
 Sarfraz's bat has also played well in the first season of IPL and Ranji Trophy
 kuch khilaadi antarrashtriya str ke liye jald hi ho jate hai taiyarkuch logon kii soch hoti he kiyuva khilaadiyonka chayan rashtriya team main tab hona chahie jab wo gharelu maichon kii bhatti main puri tarah se pak chukaa ho
 But there are some special talents who break all the assumptions and move forward and achieve great success
 sachin tendulkar, viraat kohli, wasim akram, vakaar yunus, steve wa, mohammad aamir or irfan pathan jaise kai cricketer hai jasne zyada first class cricket khele bina hi antarrashtriya str par khub dhooma machaaya
 There is a player of every format, Sarfaraz Khan of stature, from Sarfaraj Chhote, the way in which the big bowlers have been beaten, one thing is clear that this batsman owns some special skills
 lekin kuch log sarfaraj ko sirf tii20 kaa khilaadi kaa maanate hai, jabaki yah sach nahin he
 While Sarfaraz has brought himself into the category of players like Gayle, de Villiers and Kohli with his aggressiveness in the IPL, his patience led Team India to the final in the Under 19 World Cup
 sunil gavaskar, sachin tendulkar, viraat kohli, shen watson, kris gail, david warner jaise diggaj sarfaraj kii tarif main kaside pard chuke hai
 When Sarfaraz left Mumbai and came to play Ranji for Uttar Pradesh, he proved himself by scoring a century in the first match that he can play Test matches too
 manish or sarfaraj har jagah fitmanish pandey or sarfaraj khan kii khaas baat yah he ki vah kisi bhi number par ballebaaji kar sakate hai
 These two also have the potential of Rahul Dravid and Ajinkya Rahane
 chaahe unase open kara len yaa middle order main khilaa len vah har jagah khilne ke liye taiyaar hai
 One thing in all things is that these talents need to be given a chance at the right time
 kyonki agar sachin ko kam umr main hi mauka na mila hota to vah aaj sachin tendulkar na hote

 The protesters also included those who have resigned their posts to show solidarity with Rahul Gandhi
 pradarshan karne waalon main dilli ke party netaa rajesh lilothea, shobhaa ojha or jagadish titalar shaamil rahe
 Lilothia said, "our demand is that Rahul Gandhi should continue in his post
 "unhone kaha ki loksabhaa main mili haar kii jimmedaari party ke sabhi netaaon kii he or gandhi ko akele doshi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 a day earlier, chief ministers of five Congress-ruled states met Rahul and urged him to lead the party as Congress president
 congress dwaara sirf 52 loksabhaa siten jeetne ke baad gandhi ne party pramukh kaa pad chhodane kii peshkash kii he
 Just think! How would it be if you are sitting with your family watching some religious channel and suddenly porn starts appearing in it

 According to media reports, Senegal's Islamic channel 'tuba TV' which shows religious programs related to Islam

 logon ne channel ke laicence ko radd karne kii maang tak kar daali
 In view of the anger of the people, the local administration swung into action and filed a complaint under the Criminal Act on the channel
 kaise hua prasaranjab prashasan ne channel se safai maangate hue is bare main poocha ki aakhir prasaaran hua kaise? to is par channel ne bataaya ki ye harakat kuch log apane agenda ko failaane ke liye kii he
 The channel is busy in search of therapies
 unke khilaaf cese bhi darj kiya gaya he
 The channel asked for forgiveness, apologizing for the incident and said that we are a religious channel and we apologize for such broadcasts

 ' 'luteraa’ kaa nirdesan kiya he, vikramaditya motwani ne or film main ahm kirdaar nibhaae hai, sonakshi sinha or ranvir singh ne
 Before i go ahead, let me tell you that there are two types of movies, one that makes money at the box office, and one that touches your heart
 'luteraa' duusari shrenee main aati he, jo aapke dil ko chhu jaaegi
 The first shot of the film is very effective and i felt that i have reached a different world
 vaise, yah film aadhaarit he, 1953 main aazaadee ke baad jameendaari ke daur par
 The film stars landlord Barun Chanda's daughter 'pakhi', Sonakshi Sinha, who is fond of reading and writing books
 varun yani ranvir singh is parivaar main shaamil hote hai, orcologist banakar
 Pakhi and Varun fall in love, but due to some reasons the two are unable to get married and Varun i
e
 Ranveer Singh has to leave Pakhi
 aage kii kahani ke liye aapako film dekhni hogi, par main aapako bataa duun ki film kaa ek hissaa o henry kii laghu katha ’da last lif’ par aadhaarit he
 Vikramaditya Motwani has given excellent direction, but has also done excellent work by cinematographer Mahendra j Shetty, who has a frame masterpiece for each scene shot
 tippaniyan Sonakshi has a shaky performance and Ranveer Singh has also handled his character well
 amit trivedi kaa becoground−score kamaal kaa he or gane to pehle se hi logon ko kaaphi pasand aa rahe hai
 Barun Chanda, who became Sonakshi's father in the role of Zamindar, emerges as a strong pillar in the film, but as i often say, i am saying that a director has to have a heart like 'hangman' for his film somewhere
 , Because the first half of the film is extremely slow
 khubasurat lamhe banane ke chakkar main vikramaditya itane kho gaye ki unhen andaja nahin rahaa ki film ke khubasurat seens ke chakkar ne kahani main brake laga diya
 i agree that it was necessary to show Ishq flourishing between the two characters, but that could have been the case even further and i was forced to rethink the star ratings to such an extent
 khayr, is film main tehraav bhi he, imoshan bhi he or drama bhi
 People accustomed to watching fast movies may find this film slow
 kaaphi hisaab-kitaab karne ke baad meri ore se film ko 3 stars
 'marauder' falls into the second category, which will touch your heart
 film kaa pehla shot hi kaaphi asardaar he or laga ki main alag hi duniya main pahunch gaya
 By the way, the film is based on the zamindari era after independence in 1953
 film main jameendaar bane barun chanda kii beti ’paakhi’ bani hai, sonakshi sinha, jinhen kitaaben padhane or likhane kaa bada shauk he

 Ranveer Singh joins this family, becoming an archeologist
 paakhi or varun main pyaar ho jaataa he, lekin kuch vajahon se donon kii shaadi nahin ho paati or varun yani ranvir singh ko paakhi ko chhodkar janaa padataa he
 You will have to watch the film for further story, but let me tell you that a part of the film is based on o Henry's short story 'the Last Leaf'
 vikramaditya motwani ne behtareen nirdesan kiya he, par inase bhi laajawab kaam kiya he, cinemetographer mahendra je shetty ne, jinke shoot kiye gaye seen kaa ek-ek frem masterpis he
 The comments sonakshi kii jhakzor deni vaali parformens he or ranvir singh ne bhi apana kirdaar bakhubi sambhala he
 Amit Trivedi's background score is amazing and the songs are already liked by the people
 jameendaar ke kirdaar main sonakshi ke pita bane barun chanda film main majboot pillar ke taur par ubharate hai, par jaisaa main aksar kahata hum ek diarector ko kahin-kahin apni film ke liye ’jallaad’ jaisaa dil rakhana jaruri he aisa main isliye kah rahaa hum, kyonki film kaa pehla bhaag behad dhimaa he
 Vikramaditya was so lost in the cycle of making beautiful moments that he did not know that the film's beautiful scenes made a break in the story
 main maanata hum ki donon kirdaaron ke bich panpate ishk ko dikhaanaa jaruri tha, par vah kahani ko aage badhaate hue bhi ho saktaa tha or yah is had tak khinchaa kii star reating ke liye mujhe dobaaraa sochane par majaboor hona padaa
 Well, the film also has stagnation, emotion as well as drama
 fast filmein dekhne ke aadi logon ko yah film slo lag sakati he
 After doing a lot of calculations, i got the film 3 stars

 Rishi Kapoor is known to say things openly
 ab jab unki biography 'khullam khulla: rishi kapur ansensord' ai he to kai khulaason se unhone duniya ko hairaan kar diya he
 These include everything from buying awards, Raj Kapoor's affair, his relationship with Ranbir Kapoor and his connection to Dawood Ibrahim
 aaj tak ko die ek exclusive intervyuu main unhone in tamaam muddon main khullam-khulla tareekon se baat kii -daaud ke saath pi chaay, to kyarishi kapurin dinon daaud ke saath chaay pine ke apane vivaad ko lekar charchaa main hai
 On this question, he said that what is wrong with drinking tea with Dawood
 daaud mere fain the or film 'tawayph' main mere role se impress the
 But while visiting, i do not know with whom i will meet
 rishi kapur ne apni baatcheet main yah bhi kaha ki ham kalakaar hai, criminals se inspire hote hai
 There is no harm in it if we have to meet everyone for work and character
 amitabh se thi takkar to rishi kapur ne 30 hajaar dekar kharida tha awarmpapa kii maut ke baad daaud ne diya tha sandesh1993 kii daaud se apni mulaakaat ke baad usase sambandh jari rakhane ke sawaal par rishi kapur ne kaha ki usee saal june main unke papa rajkpur kii maut ke baad daaud ne ek vyakti ko bheja tha
 Dawood sent a message to him that he has come to meet him in a secret way
 rishi kapur ne yah bhi sweekaara ki daaud ne unase tohfa lene ko kaha tha lekin iske liye unhone saaf inkaar kar diya tha
 What does Rishi Kapoor think about Dawood today? On this, Rishi Kapoor said - Yes i agree that Dawood is a terrorist and now i never want to meet him
 main kabhi apane mulk ke khilaaf nahi jaaoongaa
 Rishi Kapoor in his book revealed the relationship between Raj Kapoor and Nargis bought the award, but not that filmfare, Rishi Kapoor openly admits that he bought the award for Rs
 30,000 when he was confronted with Amitabh Bachchan
 haalanki ve ise apana bachapanaa bataate hai or iske liye sharmindagi bhi jaahir karte hai
 However, he denied the insistence that the award was a Filmfare
 saath hi vah is baat se bhi inkaar karte hai ki aajkal ke awords bike hue hote hai
 Rishi Kapoor dedicated this special thing in Tirupati
 
 
 rajkpur ke afaire main chhipaane jaisaa kuch nahikepani byography 'khullam khulla: rishi kapur ansensord' main papa rajkpur ke afaire ke bare main rishi kapur ne kaha- sabhi ko ye baaten pataa hai
 i don't think they have the advantage of hiding anymore
 ham insaan hai, galtiyaan sabhi se hoti hai
 Although Rishi Kapoor says about Raj Kapoor - my personality belongs to him

 Nothing has changed for them
 sapanom kii baat thi
 The dreams that Indira Gandhi showed to the people in 1971 that they would get a meal of bread
 wo aaj bhi bharat kii janata ke liye sapana hi he or shri rahul gandhi usee sapane ko saakaar karne kii baat karte hai

 chaahe vah khaadya suraksha bill ho yaa bhoomi adhigrahan bill, donon bill vipaksh ke samarthan ke baad hi paas hue
 Who opposed it ham to adhik sudhaar chaahate the

 modi ke paas kehane ke liye bahut kuch tha
 Rahul had nothing to say nor to speak
 modi kariban ek ghanta bole or ye 15 minute bole
 Modi gave an hour speech and said a lot
 ye sirf 15 minute bole phir bhi kuch nahin kaha
 Rahulbjp said, 'rahul Gandhi lives in the dream world
 sapane bhi vahi dikhaate he jo unki daadi 1971 main logon ko dikhaati thi
 In the last 45 years, except for 10 years, the Congress government has been at the center
 abhi tak wo sapane saakaar kyon nahin hue? rahul gandhi ko iske bare main bataanaa chahie
 10 years ago promised to reduce inflation in 100 days
 kam karnaa to dur, mahangaai 10 guna bad gai
 Why Rahul Gandhi does not speak on this promise 'rahul gandhi ke bhaashan par bijepi ke pravaktaa sudhanshu trivedi ne bhi jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 He said, 'today's statement of Rahul is the result of hiding his incompetence and short-sightedness

 Shiv Sena did not accept this decision of BJP and put up its candidate in front of Rane
 yani gathbandhan hone ke baavjood kankavali seat par bijepi or shivasena ke apane-apane pratyaashee alag chunaav lard rahe hai
 Fadnavis claimed Nitesh Rane's victory On Tuesday, Chief Minister Fadnavis campaigned in favor of Nitesh Rane and claimed his victory

 Thackeray is also campaigning for a Shiv Sena candidate in Kankavali
 haalanki, pehle unka yahaan jane kaa plan nahin tha
 Why did Fadnavis and Thackeray come face to face? Behind this political picture, Uddhav Thackeray and Nitesh Rane's father Narayan Rane's old feud is considered

 After the Congress, Narayan Rane formed his own party named Maharashtra Swabhiman Party (MSP), which merged with the BJP on Tuesday (october 15)
 is vilay kaarykram kii adhyakshata mukhyamantri denvendra fadanvis ne kii, jo nitesh rane ke vidhansabha kshetra kankavali main yojit kiya gaya tha
 In the area of nitesh Rane, Fadnavis claimed his victory, after which Uddhav Thackeray announced his entry into the region
 kankavali seat par bijepi ke nitesh rane ke saamne shivasena ne satish saavant ko tikat diya he
 Voting is scheduled on 21 October and the result will come on 24 October

 aakhirkaar 53 din se jindagi or maut ke bich chal rahi jang main babar sher vishnu ne haar maan lee
 The lion, who came from Hyderabad's zoo, breathed his last at the Lion Safari in Etawah at eight in the morning of 16 November
 30 aktubar ko vishnu kii saathi sherni lakshmi ne bhi dam tod diya tha
 17 days later, the atmosphere of the safari was shattered by this second incident
 samaajawaadee party ke rashtriya adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav kaa yah swapnil project sher ke bacchon kii athkheliyon se gulzaar hone se pehle hi durlabh nasl ke babar sheron ke shmashaan main badal gaya he
 The death of unruly animals, seemingly mysterious, has put the entire government system in question
 safari main kathghare main band gujarat ke junagarh se aae sheron ke teen jodon kii swasthya suraksha kaa bandobast bhi kathghare main hi khadaa he
 An area of three and a half hectares of rugged area south of Gwalior bypass in Etawah is being developed as 'babar Lion Breeding Center and Lion Safari Park'
 shudgh aciatic sheron kii suraksha or unke sangrakshan ke liye itawa main taiyaar ho rahaa yah project puure desh main apni tarah kaa iklauta he
 As part of the animal swap scheme, the state government kept three pairs of the lion manan-kunari, kuber-grishma and jiga-heer from Junagadh in Gujarat, before being sent to Lion Safari in Lucknow's zoo and Vishnu from Hyderabad
 -laxmi was initially a guest of the zoo in Kanpur
 is saal 11 april ko gujarat main junagarh ke sheron kaa pehla joda lakhanu chidebaghar se line safari pahunchaa
 Three pairs of lions arrived on September 2, September 7 and September 10
 kuch hi din baad kanpur chidebaghar se aae jode vishnu or lakshmi kii tabiyat bigadgaye lagi
 Vishnu first had high fever and paralyzed the back of his body on 23 September
 kuch din baad lakshmi bhi aise lakshanon kaa shikaar ho gai
 From the sudden ill of the lions to the Etawah Lion Safari, there was a stir among the officers sitting in the Forest Department of Lucknow
 sapa sarkaar ke is dream project par mandara rahe khatre se nibatane ke liye bareli or mathura ke veterinary instetïyut, lakhanu or agra ke chidebaghar ke veterinary doctoron ne vahaan deraa daal diya
 Apart from doctors from all the reputed institutions of the country including Karnataka, experts from London's Longlands Safari were consulted, but the disease of lions did not catch up
 beemaari se ladate hue pehle lakshmi or phir vishnu ne dam tod diya
 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's tears have been raised due to this incident
 ve kehete hai, ''maine line safari main hui sheron kii maut par report maangi he
 Its guilty officers will not be spared
 "kadam-kadam par laaparvaaheesheron ko kanpur ke chidebaghar se itawa line safari main laane ke dauraan ghor laaparvaahee hui
 The cage in which Vishnu and Lakshmi were brought was relatively large
 usamen takaraane se donon sheron ko gambhir chotein ain
 "he was given a sharp antibiotic to heal the wound immediately, and from there, his condition deteriorated," says a doctor who treated the lions
 He was exposed to the mice disease 'leptosparia' while living in the Kanpur zoo
 Due to which, his liver was greatly weakened
 aise main tej antibiotic dawaaon ne sheron ke sharir par bura asar daalaa
 "there is nothing clear about the cause of the lion's death," says Roopak Dey, the state's chief conservator of forests
 sambhavat: ye kisi anuvanshik beemaari se grast the
 "dey states that the Hyderabad zoo administration has hidden the disease of the lions
 is kaaran unke ilaaj main bhi dikkatein ain
 But the officials cannot escape their responsibility by making these arguments
 unki karypranali apane aap main hi andeh or sawaal paidaa kar rahi he
 If the disease was not known, then what was the doctor treating
 67 dinon ke bheetar sheron ke ilaaj par 10 lakh ru
 Why did the disease not catch up despite spending? To what extent are the two lions likely to suffer from the same genetic disease? If this is the case then why did they fall ill after coming on safari? Why did only four pairs of lions get sick in Kanpur zoo? kya vahaan koi laaparvaahee hui? aise kai sawaalon se bachate hue de kehete hai ''lakshanon ke aadhaar par ilaaj ho rahaa tha
 No effective investigation has yet been discovered to catch the genetic disease of lions
 "karaah rahaa aspatalalayan safari main ilaaj karne pahunche ek doctor yah dekhakar chakra gaye ki babar sher ke ilaaj ke liye bana aspataal keval ek doctor ke bharose hi chal rahaa he
 On the condition of not disclosing his name, he says, "it is a big crime to have no treatment in the hospital before four pairs of lions arrive
" vishnu or lakshmi ne isi kaa khamiaja bhugta
 "the doctor's allegations appear to be confirmed as soon as they enter the hospital
 ek kamare ke baahar 'radiology' likhaa hua kaagaj chaspaan he, lekin bheetar sirf kuch kursiyaan padi hai
 There were to be all the arrangements including X-ray, ultrasound, but till now it is stuck on the paper
 do hafte pehle jab achaanak vishnu ke hriday kii jaanch kii jarurat padi to mulaayam ke gaanv saifai main bane gramin ayurvigyaan santhaan se isiji mashin lani padi
 The surprising thing is that there is not a single 'squeezer Cage' in Safari to test the lions
 yah ek aisa baadaa hota he, jisamen sher ke sharir ko halkaa dabaakar uski gatividhi simit kar di jaati he
 This not only makes the test easier, but can also be injected correctly
 sheron kii nigaraanee main tainaat ek karmchaaree kehete hai, ''squeeger kej na hone se sheron ko blo pipe se injection diya ja rahaa he
 Once the mark was missed, Lakshmi's needle was inserted in the bone, causing her to limp for a long time
 "(aakhirkaar nahin bachaaya ja sakaa vishnu sher)jagah par uthe sawalsawaal yah he ki kya yamuna kinare faile is behad main sher rah paaenge? 2005 se 2007 ke bich kendriya vanya jeev praadhikaran, paryaavaran or van mantralay or uttar pradesh sarkaar ke bich hue patrachaar or baithkon main line safari banane ke takneekee pahaluon par vistaar se charchaa hui thi
 During this time, the geographical conditions of Etawah were not considered by the experts to be suitable for lions' habitat
 in baithkon main shaamil rahe pradeshik van seva ke ek adhikari kehete hai, ''baagh ke vipareet babar sher ek saamaajik praani he
 Male and female lions live with children in herds of 10 to 15
 lekin alag se breeding centre main simit kar dene se un par vipareet maansik prabhaav padataa he
 This also reduces their immunity
 "itawa ke ek vayovridgh vakil or chambal-yamuna doaab kii aitihaasik gatividhiyon ke jaankaar kishan gahalout kehete hai, ''babarnama main yamuna ke is ilaake main sheron kii gatividhiyaan hone kii jaankaree milti he
 Later the lions disappeared due to large-scale deforestation
 " ve bataate hai ki dekharekh na hone ke kaaran 600 hectare se adhik ke kshetra main vilayati babul or contili jhadibhan ug ai thim, jo sheron ke liye sabase khatarnaak he
 Suresh Chandu Rajput, a regional forest officer in Etawah, says, "acacia and special grass have been planted by removing acacia and shrubs from safari land
 "badahaali kii paraakaashthasheron kii gatividhiyon par najar rakhane ke liye safari main kul 19 ju keeper hone chahie, lekin ab tak keval teen hi tainaat hai
 Out of the total 90 sanctioned posts for Lion Safari, only 17 are filled, which is less than 20% of the capacity
 mulaayam ke dream project line safari ke in aadhu-adhure kaaryon ne vipakshiyon ko mauka de diya he
 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) spokesperson and Leader of Opposition in UP Legislative Assembly Swami Prasad Maurya says, "all the dream projects of the SP government are being shut down one by one due to mismanagement
" line safari kii haalat bhi kisi se chhipi nahin he

 Due to this there is a wave of happiness in the bjp-shiv Sena camp, on the other hand, there is disappointment in the Nationalist Congress party-congress alliance
 ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar apane rajnatik kariyar main sabase mushkil daur se guzar rahe hai
 Sharad Pawar did not seem to get seats in the manner in which he carried the flag of his alliance and carried out the campaign soaked in rain

 paakali jeevanabhar isi dar main jiti rahi ki uskaa parivaar jis jameen ko jot-bokar apana guzar-basar karata he, vah kabhi bhi chhin lee jaaegi
 People used to tell him that this land belongs to the government, it will be evicted anytime
 paakali ko samaj main nahin aata tha ki jis jameen ko baap-dadaon ne sanvaara, jise apane paseene se sinchaa, use bachaae to bachaae kaise
 He had seen the kind of troubles that thousands of forest dwellers like him have to face
 unhen afasaron kii ghudki or taane sunne padate the ki uskaa parivaar gaiyrkanoonee kaam kar rahaa he
 Pakali did not understand how it could be a crime to sweat, to break the stones and fertilize the ground, to grow grains in the soil? Pakali kept plowing the land and age continued to streak on his muscles
 lekin vahi paakali kal unheen adhikariyon ke saamne tan kar khadi thi
 She was smiling with eyes in his eyes, as if challenging him - now snatch and tell the ground
 kah rahi ho-sarkaar to mere saath khadi he
 Pakali was also among the thousands of villagers who came to participate in the government's development journey in Kondagaon
 vah apane seene se ek kaagaj chipkaae gum rahi thi
 Pakali is not educated
 vah nahin bataa sakati ki kaagaj main likhaa kya he
 He only knew that Chief Minister Raman Singh had given this paper himself and said that you are the owner of this land from now on
 paakali ko itnaa pataa tha ki jab sarkaar hi use sarkari jameen kii malkin ghoshit kar rahi he to ab yah jameen usase koi chin nahin saktaa
 Pakali said that he is very happy
 sarkaar jameen hi nahin de rahi, balki puch bhi rahi he ki med-paar thik-thaak to hai na
 There is no problem in cultivating rough land
 kaho to khet thik karvaa dete hai
 The government was asking whether there was a house to live
 chaaho to ghar de dete hai
 There are thousands of people in Kondagaon whose eyes have shone like Pakali's eyes
 unke chehron par vaisaa hi tej he, jaisi paakali ke chehre par he
 The pride of freedom from guilt is the same as it is for Pakali
 sab ke sab ab apni jameen ke maalik khud hai
 Not only in Kondagaon, the government is waging a campaign to identify such people and make them owners of the land
 is muhim main kondagaanv jila sabase awwal he
 This campaign has brought a big change in the lives of the forest dwellers
 ab ve bhi un tamaam sarkari suvidhaon kaa laabh uthaa sakate hai jo aam kisaan uthaaya karte hai
 Now they too can take advantage of all the schemes of the government, which are for the farmers
 ab unhen bhi sarkaar se beej mil paaegaa
 Manure will be available
 jameen par rin mil paaegaa
 Now they will be called reputed farmers, not illegal occupiers

 vahiin kisaanon ko apni fasal kii chintaa sata rahi he, kyonki unki mehnat kii kamai viraan dhan mandiyon main padi he
 Where they have no buyer
 rajya sarkaar ne 16 navambar se dhan kii kharidi shuru kar di he
 But rice millers who made rice from this paddy have gone on strike, calling the government's policy a loss deal
 unka aarope he ki maujuuda niti se unhen chaaval banane main 500 rupee prati quintal kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 The annual purchase of paddy is done in lakhs of quintals, for this, the center and the state together make an arrangement of more than 20 thousand crores
 tham gaye 1 lakh trakon ke pahiechhattisgarh main dhan mandiyon, milon or rashtriya or rajya margon ke irdagird ek lakh se zyada trakon ke pahiye tham gaye he
 These trucks have been waiting for the rice mills strike to end for a week
 lekin hadtaal khatm hone kaa naam hi nahin le rahi he
 Two rounds of negotiations have taken place between the striking rice millers and the government, but no result was found
 rice mileron kii daleel he ki custom milling se unhen 500 rupee kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 But the government is not ready to do justice to the rice mills that are shut down and going into loss
 unke mutabiq dhan dhone kaa malbhaadaa lambii duuri ke liye ghatate kram main or kam duuri kaa haada dhan mandiyon se badhate kram main diya ja rahaa he
 That too at the rate of 15 years old when diesel used to get Rs 20-22 per liter
 jabaki aaj mahangaai 200 guna bad gayi he
 Bardana, which is available in the market for 8-10 rupees, is being given to them for 32 rupees
 sarkaar ko prati din 100 karod kaa nuksaan uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 The strike by rice mills has led to the closure of more than 150 solvent plants in the state
 kyonki unke paas chaaval banane ke liye dhan hi nahin he
 Rice millers argue that the state government should follow the guidelines of the Center in this matter, according to the state president Yogesh Aggarwal Rice Millers, the government is also delaying their legitimate demands
 isse rice udyog to chaupat ho hi rahaa he, lekin unke saath kisaan, mazdooron ke bhi bure din shuru ho gaye he
 There is no buyer in the mandis, with the demonetisation from 8 November and the strike of the rice millers from the 10th, the condition of workers and farmers is getting thinner
 centre or rajya sarkaar milakar salanaa 20 hajaar karod kii dhan kii kharidi karte he
 This paddy is converted into rice and is provided to the PDS system of the country
 notebandi or hadtaal kii vajah se rajya bhar kii dhan mandiyaan viraan padi he
 The farmers hoped that their crops would be sold hands-on in these paddy mandis
 lekin aisa nahin ho paaya
 No buyers are coming to the mandis
 iske chalate hamaalon or mazdooron se lekar kisaanon ko tangahaali kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 There are more than 20 lakh such families in the family, who completely depend on these paddy mandis for livelihood
 dinon din unki halaat khasta hoti ja rahi he
 On the other hand, the government is not even worried about the demand of rice millers, the result of two rounds of meeting has been cipher
 hadataali rice miller maukey kii najaakat ko dekh kar lacheela rukh apana rahe he
 The same government has also invited him for talks, according to state food minister Punnu Lal Mohle, some solution to the problem will be found soon
 chhattisgarh main kisaanon kii aarthik sthiti dhan kii fasal kaa utpaadan or mandiyon main uski sarmathan mulya yaa phir usase adhik daam main bikri se aakaa jaataa he
 This is the only time in the year when the crop of farmers is sold at the asking price
 is maukey ko koi bhi kisaan khona nahin chahta
 The farmer tries to sell every single grain of paddy, so that he has money in his pocket for the next crop and also has a vault full of household expenses
 philhal kisaan sapane hi bun rahe he
 They are afraid that they should not clean any hands on their paddy that is kept in the mandis

 The world of devotees revolves around the circular pillars in the Mahakal temple
 inamen hi wo bharosa or chamatkaar dikhataa he jiskaa anubhav karne ke liye bhakt na to samay kii parvaah karte hai or na hi duuri kii
 The pillars in the Mahakal temple are no minor pillars, these are the pillars that fulfill the wish
 ye aasthaa ko paravaan chadhaane vaale khambhe hai, ye chamatkaar dikhaane vaale khambhe hai
 These 12 pillars of the temple of Shani Dev blesses the devotees with the blessings of Shani Dev and relieves the devotees of all their miseries
 himachal pradesh ke mahakaal gaanv main bane shanidev ke mandir main har raashi kaa ek khambha he
 It is said that if devotees tie a raw thread on their poles and ask for the wish, then Shanidev never disappoints them
 chaahe sadhesati ho yaa dhaiyya, ashtum shani kaa sankat ho yaa kantak shani ke kaante jivan main chubh rahe hon, bhakton ke jivan kaa har dukh yahaan aakar sukh main badal jaataa he
 It is said that by coming to this temple, Shani worshiped Mahakal and received a boon from him
 yaheen par shanidev kii ichha puri hui thi, isliye yahaan shanidev bhakton kii har ichha puri karte hai
 Devotees believe that worshiping in the temple and offering mustard oil to Shani Dev gets rid of half-century in seven weeks
 yahi nahin grahon kii tedi chaal se bhi mukti milti he
 But on the day of the zodiac sign to get rid of the crooked movement, a raw thread has to be tied, then the deteriorated motion of the planets along with Saturn is also eliminated
 kehete hai yahaan sarson kaa tel or daal chadhaane se shanidev jaldi prasann ho jate hai
 Devotees come here and ask for blessings of happiness and prosperity from Shiva on one hand and on the other hand get blessings from Lord Shani
 shani kii tedi chaal se kise dar nahin lagata, unke krodh se devtaa bhi thar-thar kaanpate hai, kehete hai shani kii krupa raja ko rank or rank ko raja bana sakati he
 But Almighty Shani Dev was also forced once, his existence itself started to be questioned
 sawaal bhi kuch aisa jisane na keval unhen balki unki maa chaaya ko bhi jhakzor kar rakh diya or unhen kar diya begharbar
 This temple of Mahakal tells the agony of Shani, the story of their helplessness
 himachal ke mahakaal gaanv main bana ye mandir na keval us ghatana kaa gavaah he balki shiv or shani ke atoot rishte kaa aadhaar bhi yahi mandir he
 Shanidev is the son of Surya and Chhaya, but the appearance is completely different
 surya ekadam chamakate-damakate or shani tave jaise kaale or usapar unka krodhi swabhaav
 It is said that Suryadev had doubts whether Shani was indeed his son, the gods further increased his doubt
 pati ke is aarope se chaaya vyathit ho uthin
 Suryadev renounced the shadow with a son
 kehete hai bade hone par jab shani ne maa se apane pita ke bare main poocha to chaaya ne puri kahani bataai
 This was such a difficult time for Shani, to solve which became the biggest objective of his life
 kehete hai jab shanidev ne himachal prade ke isi mahakaal mandir main aakar shiv kii aradhana kii or ghanghor tap kiya
 The worship and tears of Shani melted Mahakal
 mahakaal ke aashirwad ne shanidev ko itnaa shaktishaalee bana diya ki insaan kya devtaa bhi unase khonf khate hai
 Not only this, Mahakal also convinced the Sun God that Shani is his son
 usee din se is dham main shiv or shanidev kii ek saath puja kii jaati he
 At first Shanidev used to sit with Lord Shiva, but later his temple was built separately
 yahaan bhakt pehle mahakaal ke dasharn kar unase aashirwad lete hai phir shanidev kii aradhana kii jaati he
 It is said that after coming here, no one goes empty handed and if eclipse and worship is done on a particular day, then every wish of the devotees gets the blessings of Lord Shani with Mahakal
